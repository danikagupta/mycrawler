Abstract — Lignin degrading white rot fung i, Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium, S chizoph yllum commune and Lenzites eximia 
were  isolated from the logs of Acacia nilotica, Tarmarindus 
indica, Eucalyptus grandis from  the We stern Ghats region of 
Karnataka , India. The fungi  were  used for the decolourization of 
azo dyes such as Acid orange 7 , Methly red,  and Evans blue . . P. 
chrysosporium 787 removed 94.8 per cent of acid orange 7 50 µM 
concentration. In S .commune removed 96.7 per cent of Acid 
orange 7 from aqueous solution. When the dye was treated with 
L. eximia maximum (95.5 %) dye removal w as observed. For 
methyl red, P. chrysosporium 787 treatment maximum of 92.2 
per cent dye was removed. In S. commune treatment, 98.5 per 
cent of methyl red was removed. The per cent of methyl red 
removal from aqueous solution by L. eximia was observed up to  
96.0 per cent. In Evans blue, P. chrysosporium 787 treatment, 
resulted in 90.2 per cent dye was removed. When the dye was 
treated with S. commune, 97.4 per cent dye was removed. In L. 
eximia treatment, the per cent of dye removal was observed 95.5 
per cen t. All the above results were obtained on fourth day of 
incubation. Maximum decolourization of azo dyes and mycelium 
growth of all the three test fungi were favoured on fourth day of 
incubation. The fungus S. commune efficiently removed acid 
orange 7 (96.7 ), methyl red (98.50 %) and evans blue (97.4 %) 
from the effluent when compared with the other two fungi.

I. INTRODUCTION  
 Synthetic dyes are widely used in the textile, paper, 
cosmetics, leathe r, dyeing, colour photography, 
pharmaceutical and food industries. In textile industries, 
during dyeing process, about 10 to 30 per cent or more of the 
dyes are released into water bodies causing serious 
environmental problem in many parts of the world.  The main 
common property of dyes is to absorb light due to the 
chromophore, a part of the molecule responsible for its 
colour. The colour arises when a molecule absorbs certain 
wavelengths of visible light and transmits or reflects the 
others.

However , the variation  in the structure is enormous and 
many thousand different dyes are produced for commercial  
use. In general, dyes can be classified according to their 
chemical structure, particularly chromophore, and the 
method of application   
  Azo pigment s are colourless particles, which have been 
coloured using an azo compound. Depending upon the 
number of azo groups present they are called as monazo, 
diazo, triazo, tetraazo  and polyazo dyes [1 ].Commercial dyes 
have a great variety of colours, high stabil ity to light, 
temperature, detergent and microbial attack. The colours in 
industrial effluents cause environmental concern, but they are 
not toxic, however many azo dyes constituting the largest dye 
group is decomposed into potential carcinogenic amides 
under anaerobic conditions after discharge into effluent [2 ]. 
Several amino -substituted azo dyes including 
4-phenylazoaniline and N -methyl and N, N -dimethyl 4 - 
phenylazo anilines are mutagenic as well as carcinogenic. In 
mammals azo dyes are reduced to aryl amines by cytochrome 
p 450 and a flavin -dependent cytosolic reductase [3 ]. Most of 
the dyes currently used could be degraded and removed by 
physical and chemical processes and sometimes the 
degradation products are more toxic. The azo dyes exposure 
can red uce fertility. When male and female mice were 
exposed to Acid orange 7  (II), uterogonadal developments in 
both sexes were adversely affected [4 ]. Azo dyes generally 
contain one or more sulphonic groups on aromatic rings 
which might act as detergents and in hibit the growth of 
microorganisms. But it has been reported that 
microorganisms are capable of degrading azo dyes and could 
be used in effluent treatment plants for removal of these dyes. 
Microbial decolourisation has been proposed as a less 
expensive and  less environmentally intrusive alternative. 
Various bacteria and fungi have decolourising abilities and 
an extensive review of microbial decolourization is available 
[5] [6 ]. 
   Many species of white rot fungi have been reported to 
decolourize textile dye s containing azo dyes. The sequential 
adsorption and degradation of dye molecules on living fungal 
hypae may provide a mechanism for feasible application of 
white rot fungi in a continuous treatment of industrial 
effluent. [7] first attempted that ligninol ytic cultures of P. 
chrysosporium  was able to decolourize several polymeric 
dyes. The biodegradation of dyes by white rot fungi and their 
ligninolytic enzyme system offers an advantage over other 
processes because of their ability to completely mineralize 
various dyes to CO 2 and H 2O. Enzymes such as lignin 
peroxidase (LiP), manganese dependent peroxidase (MnP) 
and laccase have been reported to decolourize dyes [8 ]. 
Lignin peroxidase, laccase and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) of 
white rot fungi degrade many aroma tic compounds due to  
their non specific activity [9 ]. Laccase are mutlicopper 
enzymes, which catalyse the oxidation of wide range of Bioremediation of Textile Dyes by White Rot

914 inorganic and organic substances, using oxygen as electron 
acceptor [1 0]. Swamy and Ramsay (1999) reported that white 
rot fungi secrete extracellular ligninases tha t could degrade 
the azo dyes.[11 ] reported the ability of white rot fungus, P. 
chrysosporium  and its enzymes to decolourise Orange II in 
liquid systems, besides role of enzymatic activity on colour 
removal. [1 2] rep orted the decolourization of azo dyes and 
dye industry effluent by a white rot fungus Thelephora sp . 
[13] suggested the binding of dyes to fungal hypae, physical 
adsorption and enzymatic degradation by extracellular and 
intracellular enzymes as major mecha nisms for the colour 
removal. As a result of the studies on the physical adsorption 
and the enzymatic degradation of the adsorbed dye 
molecules, the enzymatic degradation of adsorbed dyes has 
been regarded as a major mechanism in the regeneration of 
dye ad sorption capacity of the mycelium. [1 3] reported the 
microbial decolourization of azo dyes and dye industry 
effluent by Fomes lividus . [14 ] reported decolourisation of 
Orange II by immobilized thermotolerant white rot fungus 
Coriolus versicolor  RC3 in pack ed-bed bioreactor. The 
decolourisation of Remazol brilliant blue R by laccase from 
the spent compost of Lentinus polychrous  has also been 
reported [15 ]. The rate of decolourisation for crystal violet, 
tryphan blue, amido black, acid orange 7  and RBBR dyes by 
enzymes from spent mushroom comp ost (SMC)  has been 
reported [16]. [17 ] reported the decolourization of synthetic 
dyes by the white rot fungi Coriolus versicolor   and Funalia 
trogii . [18] reported the biodegradation of textile azo dyes by 
the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium . [19 ] 
reported the decolourization of textile dyes by the white rot 
fungi T.versicolor . Sathiyamoorthi et al.  (2006) reported that 
the two species of white rot fungi were evaluated for their 
ability to decolourize the dye s Blue CA, Black B133, Corazol 
violet SR by the white rot fungi T. hirusta  and Pleurotus 
florida . [20] reported the bioreactor designs for industial 
effluent decolourization from white rot fungi in submerged 
and immobilized liquid cultures. [21] screened e ighteen 
fungal isolates for their potential to decolourize the 
commercial used reactive textile dyes, reactive orange 96, 
reactive blue 15, reactive blue 38 and reported that only few 
organisms of white rot fungi such as T. versicolor, 
Bjerkandera adusta and P. chrysosporium were able to 
decolourize all the dyes .[22] reported the decolourization  of 
synthetic  dyes by T. hirsuta  in expanded -bed reactors. 
Decolourization of two azo dyes  namely Direct Red –80 and 
Mordant Blue –9 by P. chrysosporium  was investigat ed both 
individually and in mixtures in batch shake flasks . [23] 
compared the degradation of a polymeric dye (polyR -478) by 
127 strains to estimate the peroxidase activity, the correlation 
between the polymeric dye decolourization and the 
peroxidase activi ty was pointed out. [24] also studied the 
enzymatic properties of 90 white -rot fungi  strains.  [25]   
reported that 115 fungi from different physio -ecological 
groups were compared for their capability to decolorize 
anthroquinone and azo dyes.  [26] reported t hat in liquid 
culture, Dichomitus squalens  decolourized both 
methylorange and RBBR efficiently.  The early step in azo 
dyes decolourization is the breaking of the azo bond and 
further degradation involving aromatic cleavage depends on 
the identity, number a nd position of functional groups in the 
aromatic region and the resulting interaction with the azo 
bonds.  II.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  
White  rot fungi were collected  from various sources like 
decaying wood logs, tree trunks and tree stumps.  Mostly fruit 
bodies  were collected from the forest of Western Ghats area of 
Karnatak a, India. The collection sight was  situated in the 
latitude of -11.58,oS and longitude of 76.93oE at 400 ± 50M  
MSL. It receives rain fall of about 600 mm per year with high 
humidity and temp erature. Mostly fresh fruit body was 
collected from the woody substrate, when the fruit bodies 
were not a vailable the part of the host  plant showing the fungal 
growth were  collected.  The exterior surface of the fruit body 
was sterilized with 1 per cent me rcuric chloride solution 
repeatedly washed with sterile distilled water and inoculated 
on 2 per cent malt agar medium plates. The plates were 
incubated at 37°C. Further subculturing were  done and  pure 
culture s were obtained .

A. Preparation of spore suspension  
The fungi were grown in malt agar pl ates for 6 days at 37°C.  
Then the plates were flooded with sterile distilled water and 
brushed with camel hair brush smoothly without disturbing the 
mycelial growth. The suspension was filtered over a sterile 
filter system to remove the mycelia fragments and  the 
concentration of the filtered spore suspension was adjusted to 
105 spores/ml and inoculum is used for dye decolourization  
studies.  
B. Decolourization of azo dyes  
 The ability of the fungi to degrade the az o dyes, acid 
orange 7, methyl red  and evans  blue, were studied in 
C-limited medium. C -limited medium was inoculated with 
fungal spore suspensions (105 spores/ml) and incubated at  30 
C for 6 days in an orbital sh aker. After six days, the dyes  
were added. The samples were withdrawn at regular time s 
intervals, filtered and the optical density of the clear filtrate 
was measured in a spectrophotometer at 497 nm, 465 nm and 
479 nm respectively for Acid orange 7, Methyl red and E vans 
blue. Samples were withdrawn at regular time intervals and 
analysed fo r total colour removal.  
III. RESULTS  AND DISCUSSION  
A. Acid orange 7  
In the present study three fungi were studied for the removal 
of acid orange 7  from aqueous solution. The re sults were 
tabulated in Table 1 . 
The control value was observed to be 0.214 at 497 nm. The 
fungus P. chrysosporium 787 removed 94.8 per cent of 50 
µM dye from the aqueous solution within fourth day of 
incubation period. Mycelial growth also increased up to 54.0 
mg on fourth day. Data in figure 1    showed that at 25  µM 
concentration 94.5 per cent of the dye was removed. Dye 
above 100 µM concentration became toxic to the mycelium 
growth.

White -rot basidiomycetes are a group of fungi capable of 
depolymerizing and mineralizing otherwise not easily 
degradable lignin with their extracellular a nd non -specific 
ligninolytic enzymes. In the 1980s, this fact stimulated 
research on the ab ility of ligninolytic fungi to degrade 
organic pollutants  [27], [28].  It was established that 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium is capable of biodegrading 
various pollutants and it soon became a model white -rot 
fungus with most of the resear ch don e up to now. The 
enzymes produced with this fungus are lignin peroxidase 
(LiP) and manganese peroxidise (MnP)  [29], [30] . In the nex t 
decade, a few new species of white -rot fungi like Pleurotus 
ostreatus  and Trametes versicolo r [31], [33] were 
characterize d for the dye degradation. A more intense 
research with Irpex lacteus  [34] and Bjerkandera adusta  
[35], [36]  started in the last  decade, while the interest in the 
decolourization capability of Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  
[37], [38] .  
In the present study t hree fungi were studied for the removal 
of Acid orang e 7, methyl red and Evans blue  from aqueous 
solution. The re sults were tabulated in Table 1, 2 and 3 
mycelial  dry weight  (mg/g)  
 %   decrease over control   Bioremediation of Textile Dyes by White Rot Fungi Isolated From Western Ghats Area  
 
918 respectively . P. chrysosporium 787 removed 94.8 per cent of  
acid orange 7  50 µM concentration. In S .commune removed 
96.7 per cent of Acid orange 7  from aqueous solution. When 
the dye was treated with L. eximia  maximum (95.5  %) dye 
removal was observed. For methyl red, P . chrysosporium 787 
treatment maximum of 92.2 per cent dye was removed. In S. 
commune treatment,  98.5 per cent of methyl red was 
removed. The per cent of methyl red removal from aqueous 
solution by L. eximia  was observed up to 96 .0 per cent. In 
Evans blue , P. chrysosporium 787 treatment, resulted in 90.2 
per cent dye was removed. When the dy e was treated with S. 
commune , 97.4 per cent dye was removed. In L. eximia  
treatment, the per cent of dye removal was observed 95.5 per 
cent. All the above results were obtained on fourth day of 
incubation. Maximum decolourization of azo dyes and 
mycelium growth of all the three test fungi were favoured on 
fourth day of incubation. The fungus S. commune  efficiently  
removed A cid orange 7  (96.7), M ethyl red (98 .50 %) and 
Evans blue  (97.4 %) from the effluent when compared with 
the other two fungi.
