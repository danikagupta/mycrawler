ABSTRACT 
Uncontaminated and Vat blue 4 contaminated soil wer e screened for heterotrophic bacterial population a nd the 
bacterial density were found to be 19.3 X 10 4 and 5.5 X 10 4 CFU/gm respectively. The bacterial genera of dye 
contaminated soil was dominated by Pseudomonas  sp. (32.5 %) followed by Bacillus  sp. (27.5 %), Aeromonas  
sp. (15.0 %), Micrococcus  sp. (12.5 %) and Achromobacter sp . (12.5 %). The optimum inoculums load, pH and 
temperature were found to be 5%, 7 and 35 oC respectively. The initial pH of the effluent prep ared using Vat 
Blue 4 was 8.5. The free cells of P. aeruginosa reduced the pH to 7.44 after 24 hours of treatment.  The values of 
TDS, BOD 5, COD and colour removal of Vat Blue 4 were reduced  up to 62.21, 89.00, 87.95, and 95.00 %

INTRODUCTION 
Rapid industrialisation and tremendous increase 
of human population increase the conventional 
solid and liquid waste and it create problems to 
environment and mankind. One of the most 
important problems is the textile dye pollution to land and water. Generally, dyes are coloured 
compounds, which are capable of being fixed in 
fabric and are classified in accordance with their 
application. Synthetic dyes are extensively used 
in textile, paper, pharmaceutical, food and 
cosmetic industries [1, 2, 3]. In this connection, BIODEGRADATION OF TEXTILE DYE ANTHRAQUINONE VAT BLUE  4  
 
Olaganathan Rajee and Patterson Jamila                                                                                                                            744 
 decolourisation of textile dyes has caused much 
industrial and scientific concern. Their 
abatement through the process of degrading 
them prior to disposure deserves scientific and 
public concern as they are as such mostly 
carcinogenic or mutagenic. In recent years, the 
method of bioprocessing of dyes has gathered 
much scientific concern. Many methodologies 
such as membrane filtration [4], chemical 
coagulation [5], ion exchange [6] and ozone 
treatment [7] are being developed for processing 
textile wastewater. A review of different 
methodologies adopted to process these 
wastewaters proves that biological treatment is 
the best opted methodology as it does not 
adversely influence the water quality 
characteristics of the wastewater which in turn 
will decide the survival of variable biotic 
constituents.  
Vat Blue 4 is one of the common dyes used in 
the dyeing process of silk and cotton and they 
appear in wastewaters of dyeing industries in 
Tamil Nadu. Though few studies have been 
carried out on the biodegradation of the reactive 
anthraquinone dyes, there is paucity of research 
on anthraquinone vat dyes. The present study 
focuses on the prime objective of investigating 
the biodegradation of anthraquinone vat blue 4 
using indigenous bacteria, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa .  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The dye-contaminated soil samples were 
collected from Kallidaikurichi, of Tirunelveli 
district, Southern Tamil Nadu, which is well 
known for handloom production with 
flourishing dyeing units. The soil samples were 
collected both from uncontaminated and the dye 
contaminated sites in clean and sterile polythene 
bags. The samples were kept in icebox and then 
brought to the laboratory for microbiological 
analysis. The total heterotrophic bacterial 
population of the soil were analysed by the pour 
plate technique employing nutrient agar. 
Morphologically dissimilar and prominent 
colonies were picked and restreaked on nutrient 
agar to ensure purity and were identified up to 
the generic level [8]. The Bergey’s manual of Systematic bacteriology [9] was also referred in 
the identification procedures.  
Different concentrations of 100 to 1000 ppm Vat 
Blue 4 were incorporated individually in the 
nutrient agar plates. 1.0 ml of the soil suspension  
was pour plated on the dye incorporated nutrient 
agar plates and incubated at 37 0C for 24 to 72 
hours and bacterial growth was observed. The 
dye degrading bacteria isolated from sample 
with high concentrations of dye were taken up 
for further studies. Four bacterial strains were 
selected (DS-1, DS-2, DS-3 and DS-4) based on 
the efficiency of the dye degradation ability.4). 
To evaluate their dye degradation efficiency 
these isolates were streaked on dye incorporated 
plates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  DS 2 was able 
to produce clear and distinct zone of clearance 
of dye around the growth. This strain was 
selected for further investigation. 
The absorption maximum for Vat Blue 4 was 
observed to occur at 650 nm. Hence the 
decolourisation was assayed at 650nm using a 
spectrophotometer. The nutrient broths (250 ml) 
incorporated with dye at ten different 
concentrations (100 to 1000 ppm) was 
inoculated with 24 hour old bacterial culture of 
P. aeruginosa , DS 1 at 5 % (v/v) concentration 
and incubated at 37 0C for 48 hours. Aliquots 
were withdrawn from the culture broth at 12-
hours intervals and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm 
for 10 minutes in a tabletop centrifuge and the 
bacterial cells were removed as pellets. The 
supernatant was analysed spectrophotometrically 
at 650 nm and the decolourisation was 
calculated using the following formula [10] 
Percentage of decolourisation = 
 Initial absorbance value – Final absorbance 
value X 100  
 Initial absorbance value 
As a preamble to use P. aeruginosa  for 
decolourisation experiments, optimization 
studies with regard to pH, temperature and 
inoculum load were also carried out. 
Effluent containing vat blue 4 was collected 
from the dyeing unit for conducting 
bioremediation studies. The effluent was a 
mixture of anthraquinone dye, inorganic salts 
and water. Decolourisation of vat blue 4 by free BIODEGRADATION OF TEXTILE DYE ANTHRAQUINONE VAT BLUE  4  
 
Olaganathan Rajee and Patterson Jamila                                                                                                                            745 
 cells of P. aeruginosa  was further investigated. 
The effluent was incorporated with vat blue 4, to 
get the optimum dye concentration (900 ppm). 
The 24 hours old culture of P. aeruginosa  at the 
concentration of 5 % (containing 35 X 10 4 
counts of DS-2) was inoculated into the effluent 
prepared. The physico - chemcial parameters 
like pH, TDS, BOD 5 and COD of both the raw 
and treated effluents were assessed using the 
standard procedures [11]. The rate and extent of 
colour removal were analysed after 24 hours 
adopting the standard procedures [10]. 
 
RESULTS  
Isolation and Identification of dye degrading 
bacteria 
The values of total heterotrophic bacterial 
population of the uncontaminated soil and dye 
contaminated soil were determined by adopting 
pour plate technique. They were found to be 
19.3 X 10 4 CFU/gm and 5.5 X 10 4 CFU/gm 
respectively. With the view of understanding the 
distribution of the heterotrophic bacteria in the 
study area, comparison was made between the 
uncontaminated and contaminated soil. 
Student’s ‘t’ test analysis affirmed that 
significant variation prevailed between the  ‘t’ 
tests conducted (P<0.001).  In the present study, 
a total number of forty bacterial strains were 
isolated and identified from the dye 
contaminated soil sample. The bacterial genera 
of dye contaminated soil were dominated by 
Pseudomonas  sp., (32.5 %) followed by Bacillus  
sp., (27.5 %), Aeromonas  sp., (15.0 %), 
Micrococcus  sp., (12.5 %) and Achromobacter  
sp., (12.5 %) as shown in Table 1. Since the 
dominant bacterial species P. aeruginosa 
exhibited normal growth up to 1000 mg/l 
concentration and produced distinct zone of 
clearance of dye around their growth up to 1000 
mg/l it was selected for further studies.  
Optimization studies 
The optimal amount of inoculum required for 
the degradation of Vat Blue 4 was determined. 
The inoculum load of 5 % was observed to bring 
about efficient decolourisation of Vat blue 4 
within 24 hours (data not shown) (Fig.1). DS-2 
brought about the complete decolorization of 100 to 400 mg/l of Vat Blue 4 within 12 hours. 
Within 60 hours of inoculation total 
decolorization was observed up to 900 mg/l of 
Vat Blue 4 (Fig.2).  
The temperature optima of the efficacy of DS-2 
strain in dye degradation of various 
concentrations such as 300, 500 and 700 mg/l 
were assessed in 30, 35, 40 and 45 0C 
temperatures and the results were presented in 
Fig.3. The temperature optimum of DS 2 was 
found to be at 35 0 C.  
Among the various pH tested (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 
10) DS-2 had the maximum decolorization at pH 
7 for all the three concentrations such as 300, 
500 and 700 mg/l (Fig.4) tested. With DS-2 
strain at neutral pH, 100 % of decolourisation 
was achieved after 12 hours especially at the 
concentration of 300 and 500 ppm. In the case of 
700 ppm total decolourisation could be observed 
after 24 hours.  
Biodegradation and Decolourisation studies 
Table 2 depict the ability of biodegradation and 
decolourisation of anthraquinone dye by the free 
cells of P. aeruginosa.  The initial pH of the 
effluent prepared using Vat Blue 4 was 8.5. The 
free cells of P. aeruginosa reduced the pH to 
7.44 after 24 hours of treatment. The values of 
TDS, BOD 5, COD and colour removal of Vat 
Blue 4 were reduced up to 62.21, 89.00, 87.95, 
and 95.00 % respectively by P. aeruginosa.  
DISCUSSION 
The bacterial cultures meant for bio bleaching 
were isolated from the dye contaminated soil 
near the dyeing industries. Pseudomonas  sp. was 
found to be the predominant genera constituting 
32.5 % and it was followed by Bacillus  spp 
(27.5%), Aeromonas  sp. (15.0%) and 
Micrococcus  sp. (12.5.0%) and 12.5% of 
Achromobacter  sp. It deserves mention here the 
samples of the present study were collected from 
an area contaminated by anthraquinone dyes. 
Mariappan et al . [12] reported that the 
heterotrophic bacterial count in sediments 
ranged from 13.2 X 10 7 to 32.0 X 10 7 CFU/gm 
of soil. When compared to the present study, 
higher number of total viable bacterial count (8 
X 10 6 CFU/ml) was reported for the azo dye 
contaminated water of river Bhadar [13 -15] BIODEGRADATION OF TEXTILE DYE ANTHRAQUINONE VAT BLUE  4  
 
Olaganathan Rajee and Patterson Jamila                                                                                                                            746 
 Jadhav et al . [16] have reported isolation of 
organisms adapted to high dye concentration 
from sites near textile industries complex. The 
appreciable amount of THB recorded in the soil 
ecosystem by the above authors could be 
attributed to continued exposure of the 
heterotrophic microbial population to the dye 
enriched wastewater. Perhaps, viable isolates 
may thrive and multiply to sustain the 
decomposition of organic matter in the bottom 
of the soil even in the presence of high dye 
containing overlying water. A trend similar to 
the present study in the generic composition 
especially with reference to Pseudomonas  sp., 
(30.0 %), Bacillus  sp., (23.3 %), Micrococcus  
sp., (13.3 %) and Achromobacter sp., (13.3 %) 
was reported by Sudhakar et al . [17]. Six 
bacterial strains with commendable capability of 
degrading textile dyes were isolated from sludge 
and lake mud samples by Chen et al . [3]. They 
selected Aeromonas hydrophila  for further 
research because of its comparatively higher 
efficiency in colour removal. Three species of 
Pseudomonas  and one species each of Bacillus 
and Escherichia  were isolated by Mariappan et 
al . [12] from the azo dye contaminated soils 
collected from Nagercoil and Rajapalayam of 
Tamil Nadu. Prevalence of dye resistant 
microorganisms in dye-contaminated soil was 
reported by Knapp and Newby [18]. It is well 
known that soil is predominantly inhabited by 
the gram negative Pseudomonas  sp. and by 
virtue of the presence of a wide variety of extra 
chromosomal genetic material it survive 
environmental hostilities; Pseudomonas sp BSP-
3 and BSP-4 have been recorded to produce 
distinct zone of clearance of azo dye Black-E in 
concentrations up to 300 ppm [12]. 
The necessity of optimization experiments 
especially in dye degradation was formerly 
reported by Chen et al . [19]. In the present 
investigation the maximum inoculation 
attempted was 5. Further enhancement of the 
dose of the bacteria especially as immobilized 
cells was observed to low the pH up to 6.9 and 
since the pH below this is not suitable for the 
survival of fishes. Hence the levels beyond 5 % 
inoculum were never attempted in the present investigation. Sudhakar et al . [12] has reported 
such pattern of relationship among the 
concentration of azo dye (100 ppm), inoculum 
load (3.0 %) and time of exposure (36 hours) in 
their experiments with azo dye Black-E 
employing the native bacterium Pseudomonas  
BSP-4. Red RBN was decolourised (95.0%) by 
Proteus mirabilis within twenty hours at a dye 
concentration of 1.0 g/l [19]. Knapp and Newby 
[18] achieved maximum degradation of azo dyes 
using bacterial strains at neutral pH. 
Zimmermann et al . [20] also employed neutral 
pH for the degradation of azo dye using 
Pseudomonas  KF 46. Proteus mirabilis  has been 
observed to accomplish maximum colour 
removal at the optimal pH ranging from 6.5 to 
7.5 [19]. Chang et al . [21] proved that 
Pseudomonas luteola  caused rapid 
decolourisation of an azo dye Reactive Red 22 at 
pH ranging from 7 to 9. Grigsby et al . [22] also 
reported an enhanced degradation of azo dyes at 
37 0C by native micro flora. Proteus mirabilis  
displayed a good colour removal at an optimum 
temperature ranging from 30 to 35 0C [19]. 
Chang et al . [21] registered an optimum 
decolourisation of Reactive Red 22 at 37 0C by 
P. luteola.  Ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa  
CR-25 to decolorize and degrade reactive dye 
Remazol Black B (RBB) was studied under 
static and shaking conditions by Joe et al.  [23]. 
They obtained a 96% dye decolorization at 
50mg/L dye concentration; however, it reduced 
to 60% when dye concentration increased to 
300mg/L. The strain had best decolorization at 
37 °C and pH 7 under static conditions. 
Among the several bacterial strains P. 
aeruginosa is found to be potential strains with 
synergestic mode of bio bleaching the coloured 
effluents. About 60 to 70 % of colour removal 
has been observed and is associated with 2 to 3 
fold decrease in BOD 5 and COD as reported by 
Ashoka et al. [24]. Sani and Banerjee [10] 
effected the decolourisation of synthetic 
effluents of azo dye by growing cells of  Kurthia  
sp and in case of Magenta, nine-hour-old broth 
of Kurthia  sp. was used for decolourisation. 
They also recorded a COD reduction to the tune 
of 90.00 %. The free cells of P. aeruginosa BIODEGRADATION OF TEXTILE DYE ANTHRAQUINONE VAT BLUE  4  
 
Olaganathan Rajee and Patterson Jamila                                                                                                                            747 
 brought about 100 % decolourisation of Orange 
I (40 hours) and Orange II (72 hours) at 
concentrations ranging from 50 to 100 ppm [25]. 
Sarnaik and Kanekar [26] reported that P. 
alkaligenes and P. mendocina degraded 4 di and 
tri phenyl methane up to 78 % in 15 hour at a 
concentration which is similar to that of the real 
effluent. Methyl Red (100 mg/l) has been 
reported to be completely degraded in seven 
days by Aeromonas liquefaciens  [27]. Hu [28] 
investigated the aerobic decolourisation of Red 
G, Remazol Black B, RP 2B and V 2RP (0.1 % 
w/v concentration) by free cells of P. luteola  and 
reported that the dyes were degraded at the rate 
of 76, 55, 23 and 51 % respectively within 120 
hours. The free cells of methanogenic culture 
have been observed to effect 90.10 and 95 % of 
colour removal of the anthraquinone dyes, RB 4 
and RB 19 [29]. Fontenot et al., [30] achieved 
an incomplete degradation i.e., 78% colour 
removal of anthraquinone dye RB 4 in both 
amended and unamended cultures at 35 0 C. 
Pseudomonas  sp. has been observed to bring 
about a COD removal of 84 % in Congo red and 
85 % in Direct Black within five days [31]. In 
simulated wastewater the values of BOD 
removal efficiency recorded under aerobic 
condition, static and shaking condition and 
aeration-static-aeration have been recorded to be 
59.37, 87.50 and 90.62% respectively [32]. 
Under anaerobic treatment condition along with 
the usage of a fluidized bed reactor Sen and 
Demirer [33] recorded 82.00% reduction of 
COD, 94.50 % of BOD 5 and 59.00 % reduction 
of colour. Under aerobic conditions with a 
bacterial consortium Buitron et al.  [34] recorded 
99 % colour removal and 73 % mineralization of 
the azo dye Acid red 151 at the concentration of 
50 mg/l. Biodecolourisation ability of B. 
thuringiensis  was also checked for 100 ppm of 
C.I. Acid brown 14, C.I. Acid black 210, C.I. 
Acid violet 90 and C.I. Acid yellow 42 dyes. It 
brought about 90–98% decolourisation of all the 
dyes in 24 h; COD and TDS was reduced from 
246 to as low as 34 ppm and 668 to 187 mg/l 
within 24 hours due to biological treatment [16]. 
Direct Red 5B concentration decolorized was 
1100 mg/l in nutrient broth within 125 hours [17]. Removal of COD was 94% at static 
condition [17]. Commomonas UVS showed 
100% decolorization of Direct Red 5B (DR5B) 
dye at 40 ◦C and pH 6.5. Joe et al.  [24] observed 
that the initial COD of the medium consisting of 
100mgl -1 RBB was 2000 mgl -1. After the 
treatment with P. aeruginosa  CR-25 for 24h, the 
COD was only marginally reduced to 1962mgl -1 
with 90% dye decolorization. After 24hours, the 
decolorized sample was subjected to shake flask 
conditions and COD was measured at 30, 36, 42 
and 48 hours. The COD values were 
correspondingly reduced to 1490, 1080, 422 and 
340mgl -1 at 30, 36, 42 and 48 hours respectively. 
There was regular reduction in COD after every 
6 hours under shake flask conditions and finally 
it was reduced to 340mgl -1. Efficient 
decolorization of textile industry effluent 
containing disperse dye Scarlet RR was 
achieved by a developed bacterial-yeast 
consortium BL-GG within 48 hours with 68 and 
74% reduction in BOD and COD values 
respectively, while the same consortium 
decolorized the solution containing single dye 
Scarlet RR (50 mg l−1) within 18 hours (pH 9.0, 
40 °C, static condition) with 98% reduction in 
color [35]. 
Most of the research works conducted so far 
with textile dyes were mainly concerned with 
BOD, COD and colour removal. They have 
aimed at the determination of optimum pH for 
the bacterial strains to efficiently degrade the 
textile dyes. However, there is brevity of 
information in these studies regarding the fate of 
reduction of TDS and pH. The permissible pH 
limit for the discharge of textile industry effluen t 
is to the tune of pH 9 [29]. It warrants mention 
here that during the process of biodegradation 
this pH limit was never observed to surpass the 
stipulated hyper pH condition. 
 
CONCLUSION 
The present study on biodegradation of 
anthraquinone vat dyes is first of its sort and 
provides first hand information on the 
degradation of anthraquinone vat dyes which are 
commonly used in the dye industry in South 
India especially Tamil Nadu. Moreover, it BIODEGRADATION OF TEXTILE DYE ANTHRAQUINONE VAT BLUE  4

 deserves mention here that most of the dyeing 
industry effluents pollute many of the aquifers, 
which supply fresh water to the public living in 
and around the dyeing industrial units. Absence 
of perennial rivers in Tamil Nadu enhances this 
problem, as the wastewater cannot be diluted to 
non-hazardous levels. Hence biological methods 
need to be developed in such areas to check the 
extent of pollution of these dye wastes and their 
impact on the wastewater receiving aquatic 
ecosystems.
