Stem cell response to a library of scaffolds with varied 3D structures was investigated. Microarray
screening revealed that each type of scaffold structure induced a unique gene expression signature inprimary human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs). Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that treat-ments sorted by scaffold structure and not by polymer chemistry suggesting that scaffold structure was
more in ﬂuential than scaffold composition. Further, the effects of scaffold structure on hBMSC function
were mediated by cell shape. Of all the scaffolds tested, only scaffolds with a nano ﬁbrous morphology
were able to drive the hBMSCs down an osteogenic lineage in the absence of osteogenic supplements.
Nano ﬁber scaffolds forced the hBMSCs to assume an elongated, highly branched morphology. This same
morphology was seen in osteogenic controls where hBMSCs were cultured on ﬂat polymer ﬁlms in the
presence of osteogenic supplements (OS). In contrast, hBMSCs cultured on ﬂat polymer ﬁlms in the
absence of OS assumed a more rounded and less-branched morphology. These results indicate that cells
are more sensitive to scaffold structure than previously appreciated and suggest that scaffold ef ﬁcacy can
be optimized by tailoring the scaffold structure to force cells into morphologies that direct them todifferentiate down the desired lineage.

1. Introduction
Use of tissue scaffold properties to direct cell function consti-
tutes a basic tenet in the ﬁeld of tissue engineering [1]. It is known
that surface topography from the micro- to the nanoscale can
inﬂuence cell behavior [2e4]. For instance, 2D topographical cues
can induce osteoprogenitor cell [4,5] and mesenchymal stem cell
[6]osteogenesis. Since topography has been reported to direct cell
function, the hypothesis that 3D scaffold structure can direct cell
differentiation has been tested herein. Many protocols for fabri-
cating polymer scaffolds have been developed that yield a wide
variety of structures including salt-leaching (SL) [7], gas foaming
(GF) [8], phase-separation (GFPS) [9], electrospinning nano ﬁbers
(NF) [10,11] and freeform fabrication (FFF) [12,13] . Scaffolds fabri-
cated by these methods have different physical architectures
ranging from porous to ﬁbrous, nano ﬁbrous to micro ﬁbrous, and
irregular to uniform. However, a systematic study to determinehow these different scaffold structures in ﬂuence cell function has
not been performed.
Herein, gene expression signatures and osteogenic differentiation
of primary human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) were
assessed during culture on a library of scaffolds with varied structure
and chemistry. hBMSCs are adult stem cells that can be isolated from
bone marrow and can differentiate into bone, fat and cartilage [14,15] .
Scaffolds with varied structure were fabricated from the same
material poly( 3-caprolactone) (PCL) so that effects of scaffold chem-
istry could be decoupled from effects of scaffold structure. A number
of controls were also tested including 2D ﬂat samples (spun-coat
ﬁlms) and scaffolds made from a different polymer [PDLLA, poly( D,L-
lactic acid)] to control for 3D structure and chemistry, respectively.
hBMSC sensitivity to differences in scaffold structure were assessed
and a mechanism for their response based on cell shape is proposed.

into a disk shaped Te ﬂon mold (12 mm diameter, 4 mm thickness). Scaffolds in
molds were air dried for 2 h at room temperature, salt-leached 5 d in deionizedwater, air-dried for 1 d and stored in a desiccator.
2.2. PCL Gas-foamed scaffolds (PCL_GF)
PCL solution (30% by mass in chloroform) was mixed with sieved NH
4HCO 3
(250 mme425 mm) at a (NH 4HCO 3):(PCL solution) mass ratio of 2:1 to yield
a homogenous paste [8]. The paste was pressed into a disk shaped Te ﬂon mold
(12 mm diameter, 4 mm thickness). Scaffolds in molds were air dried for 2 h at roomtemperature, removed from molds, incubated in warm d-water (40
/C14C) until no gas
bubbles were generated (2 h), further leached in d-water at room temperature for
3 d, air-dried for 1 d and stored in a desiccator.
2.3. PCL Gas-foamed phase-separated scaffolds (PCL_GFPS)
Gas foamed phase separated scaffolds of PCL were fabricated by combining
thermally induced phase-separation technique (TIPS) and a gas-foaming technique[9]. PCL solution (30% by mass in 7:3 volume ratio chloroform:n-butanol) was mixed
with sieved NH
4HCO 3(250 mme425mm) at a (NH 4HCO 3):(PCL solution) mass ratio of
2:1 to yield a homogenous paste. The paste was pressed into a disk-shaped Te ﬂon
mold (12 mm diameter, 4 mm thickness) and phase separated at /C080/C14C for 4 h.
Next, the scaffolds were immersed in methanol at /C020/C14C for 24 h for solvent
exchange. Scaffolds were gas-foamed by immersion in warm d-water (40/C14C) for 2 h
(until no bubbles were released), immersed in d-water at room temperature for 3 d,air-dried for 1 d and stored in a desiccator.
2.4. PCL “Big”nano ﬁber scaffolds (PCL_BNF)
This protocol yields large diameter PCL nano ﬁbers (z900 nm). PCL solution
(30% by mass in 9:1 volume ratio chloroform: methanol) was loaded into a syringeand a syringe pump was used to dispense PCL solution (0.5 mL/h) into a home builtelectrospinning apparatus [11]. Aluminum foil was used as the target, the distance
between needle and target was 15 cm, and voltage was 15 kV. The positive lead fromthe power supply was ﬁxed to the spinneret which was an 18 gauge needle and the
ground lead was ﬁxed to the target (aluminum foil). Non-woven PCL nano ﬁber mats
were collected for 1 h onto tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) disks (12 mm dia.,punched from the bottom of 48-well TCPS plates) placed on the aluminum foiltarget. TCPS disks were lightly sprayed with 70% by mass ethanol before electro-spinning to help ﬁbers adhere to the disks. TCPS disks were made by using a hot
12 mm punch to punch disks from the bottom of TCPS 48-well plates.
2.5. PCL “Small ”nano ﬁber scaffolds (PCL_SNF)
This protocol yields small diameter PCL nano ﬁbers (z300 nm) and is the same
as for PCL-BNF except for the following changes: PCL solution 10% by mass in 3:1volume ratio chloroform: methanol, pump rate 2 mL/h and voltage 16.5 kV.
2.6. PCL Freeform fabricated scaffolds (PCL_FFF)
Disc-shaped freeform fabricated scaffolds (5 mm dia., 2 mm height, in 96-well
plates) made by precision extrusion deposition [12] were purchased from 3D Bio-
tek and used as received.
2.7. 2D Spin-coated PCL ﬁlms (PCL_SC)
Thin ﬁlms of PCL were then prepared by spin-coating PCL solution (0.8 mL, 10%
by mass in glacial acetic acid) at 1000 rpm for 30 s over TCPS disks (100 mm dia.).
Films were air-dried at room temperature for 2 h and annealed at 60
/C14C for 30 s to
adhere the PCL to the TCPS. Films were punched into 12 mm disks using a hot punchand exposed to sterile PBS to remove residual acetic acid.
2.8. PDLLA “Big”nano ﬁber scaffolds (PDLLA_BNF)
This protocol yields large diameter PDLLA nano ﬁbers (z900 nm) and is the
same as for PCL-BNF except for the following changes: PDLLA (relative molecular
mass 100,000 g/mol, Surmodics) solution 15% by mass in hexa ﬂuoroisopropanol
(1,1,1,3,3,3-hexa ﬂuoro-2-propanol), pump rate 1.5 mL/h and voltage 15 kV.
2.9. 2D Spin-coated PDLLA ﬁlms (PDLLA_SC)
Thin ﬁlms of PDLLA were then prepared by spin-coating PDLLA solution (0.8 mL,
10% by mass in glacial acetic acid) at 1500 rpm for 30 s over TCPS disks (100 mmdia.). Films were air-dried at room temperature for 2 h and annealed at 60
/C14C for 30 s
to adhere the PDLLA to the TCPS. Films were punched into 12 mm disks using a hot
punch and exposed to sterile PBS to remove residual acetic acid.2.10. Scaffold characterization
PCL_SL, PCL_GF, PCL_GFPS, PCL_BNF, PCL_SNF, PCL_FFF and PDLLA_BNF scaffolds
were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). PCL_SL, PCL_GF and
PCL_GFPS scaffolds were frozen in liquid nitrogen and fractured with a scalpel to
expose interior. PCL_BNF, PCL_SNF, PCL_FFF and PDLLA_BNF scaffolds were exam-ined from the top. Scaffolds were sputter-coated with gold for 90 s and imaged (SEM,15 kV, Hitachi s-4700 eII FE-SEM). NF diameter, FFF strut diameter and FFF strut
spacing were measured in SEM images using ImageJ software (NIH) (100measurements of each). Morphology of 2D PCL_SC and TCPS samples were viewedby transmitted white light phase contrast microscopy. Gravimetry was used tomeasure total porosity of PCL_SL, PCL_GF, PCL_GFPS and PCL_FFF scaffolds using an
equation, “Total Porosity ¼1e[(m/d)/v] ”, where “m”is mass of the scaffold (g), “d”
is PCL density (1.1 g/mL) and “v”is volume of scaffold (mL) (caliper measurements).
2.11. Cell culture
PCL_SL, PCL_GF, PCL_GFPS, PCL_BNF, PCL_SNF, PCL_SC, PDLLA_BNF and
PDLLA_SC specimens were placed in 48-well tissue-culture polystyrene plates forcell culture experiments. Wells without specimens were used as TCPS controls.PCL_FFF were put into polystyrene 96-well plates (non-tissue culture treated) forcell culture experiments. Specimens were sterilized by ethylene oxide (AndersonProducts) and degassed for 2 d under house vacuum.
Primary human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs, also known as mesen-
chymal stem cells, Tulane Center for Gene Therapy) were cultured at 37
/C14C with 5%
by volume CO 2ina-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with
16.5% by volume fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 4 mmol/L L-glutamine
[14]. To wet scaffolds fully with culture medium, medium was added to specimens in
wells and plates were placed under vacuum for 1 min. The vacuum was released andreapplied two more times. For seeding scaffolds, hBMSCs (80% con ﬂuent) were
dissociated with 0.25% mass fraction trypsin [containing 1 mmol/L ethyl-
enediaminetetraactate (EDTA)] and re-suspended in medium. Passage 4 or 5 cells
were used for all experiments. Medium was removed from scaffolds and 10,000hBMSCs in 0.5 mL of medium was added to each well for 48-well plates (PCL_SL,PCL_GF, PCL_GFPS, PCL_BNF, PCL_SNF, PCL_SC, PDLLA_BNF, PDLLA_SC, TCPS) or 5000hBMSCs in 0.2 mL of medium for 96-well plates (PCL_FFF). Medium was changedtwice per week and cells cultured for 4 time points (1 d, 7 d, 21 d, 50 d) as indicatedin the ﬁgures. In some experiments, cells were cultured in medium containing
osteogenic supplements (OS): dexamethasone (10 nmol/L),
b-glycerophosphate
(20 mmol/L) and ascorbic acid (0.05 mmol/L).
2.12. Alizarin red staining
For Alizarin red staining, scaffolds were ﬁxed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 24 h at
37/C14C and then stained with Alizarin Red S (10 mg/mL) for 1 h. Scaffolds were
washed 5 times with d-water to remove excess stain and air dried. Digital images ofstained scaffolds were acquired using a stereomicroscope. All Alizarin red experi-ments were performed with three specimens ( n¼3). Two ﬁelds of view at both low
and high magni ﬁcation were randomly selected and captured for each specimen and
representative images are shown in the ﬁgures.
2.13. Picogreen DNA assay
The Picogreen DNA assay was used to quantify cell numbers in the scaffolds.
Scaffolds were washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and then incubated
with lysis buffer (0.2 mg/mL Proteinase K and 0.02% by mass sodium dodecyl sulfate)for 24 h at 37
/C14C. After incubation, 100 mL of lysate was transferred to a clean 96-well
plate and diluted with 100 mL of Picogreen reagent (Invitrogen, diluted to working
concentration as per manufacturer ’s protocol). Fluorescence (excitation 485 nm,
emission 538 nm) was measured using a plate reader. A DNA standard curve wasgenerated using known DNA concentrations to calibrate readings.
2.14. Fluorescence staining of cells
Cells on scaffolds were ﬁxed with 3.7% formaldehyde (mass/volume in PBS
buffer) for 15 min, washed in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% by mass Triton X-100
for 5 min. Samples were rinsed with PBS and stained (1 h) with Alexa Fluor 546-phalloidin (20 nmol/L in PBS) and Sytox green (100 nmol/L in PBS buffer) to stainfor F-actin and nuclei, respectively (Invitrogen). Cells were washed with PBS.
2.15. Epi ﬂuorescence microscopy
For regular epi ﬂuorescence microscopy (non-confocal, Fig. 2 andFigs. S2 eS4)t o
assess cell proliferation, specimens were washed with PBS, then water and air-driedbefore imaging. Two specimens were prepared for each treatment. Two ﬁelds of
view at both low and high magni ﬁcation were randomly selected and captured for
green (nuclei) and red channels (actin) for each specimen and representative images
are shown in the ﬁgures.G. Kumar et al. / Biomaterials xxx (2011) 1 e9 2

Biomaterials (2011), doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.0542.16. Confocal microscopy
Confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM-510) was used to measure cell morphology
using samples wet with PBS (not air-dried). High resolution z-stack images were
captured with a 40 /C2/0.80 water immersion objective (1 mm z-step size) for nuclei
(Sytox green) and actin (Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin). Two specimens were preparedfor each treatment and ten cells were imaged and analyzed for each specimen(n¼20 cells).
Sytox green staining of nuclei was used to make sure that cell morphology was
assessed for single cells only (only one nucleus per object). Alexa Fluor 546 phal-loidin stained actin images were used to assess cell morphology. Confocal Z-stackprojections were constructed (to project entire cell surface into two dimensions) and
thresholding was performed to result in binary images. ImageJ was used to measure
cell area, aspect ratio and roundness. Cell outlines were created and analyzed forbranching. Branching was determined by counting the number of projections fromthe cell body and the number of branch points originating within that projectionwith a length greater than 5
mm.
2.17. Human genome microarray
Total RNA from hBMSCs in 3D scaffolds and on 2D surfaces at 1 d and 14 d was
collected by homogenization of the cell lysate using the QIAshredder followed bypuriﬁcation using the RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen). Four replicates were performed for
all treatments wherein a replicate was prepared by pooling cell lysates from 4samples (expect for PCL_FFF scaffolds where 8 samples were pooled). Genome-widetranscriptions of hBMSCs were measured by high-throughput screening using theIllumina Human HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips with 47231 probes for 25130
RefSeq annotated genes (NCBI/NIH) through a contract with Gene Logic (Gaithers-
burg, MD).
Data analysis was performed using the BRB-Array Tools version 4.1.0 (Biometric
Research Branch, National Cancer Institute). The average of the four replicates ofTCPS_1d was used as an in silico reference array for median normalization of all of
the individual array data. The “signiﬁcance analysis of microarrays ”(SAM) approach
[17], with a false discovery rate of 0.05, was chosen to test for signi ﬁcantly changed
genes within the osteogenic controls (4 replicates each of TCPS_1d, TCPS_14d,
TCPS_OS_1d and TCPS_OS_14d). A total of 9494 genes were identi ﬁed that were
changed signi ﬁcantly between all possible pair-wise comparisons of these treat-
ments. From those 9494 SAM-signi ﬁcant genes, a subset of 831 genes was found to
exhibit at least a two-fold change ‘between TCPS_1d and TCPS_OS_1d ’or ‘between
TCPS_14d and TCPS_OS_14d ’(this creates “black ”regions on the sorted 14d arrays
indicating “no change ”). Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), with centered correla-
tion and average linkage, was performed using all arrays and the 831 two-fold
signiﬁcant genes. A dendrogram of the relationships is shown in Fig. 3 a. The log
2
ratio of the each gene intensity compared to the reference array (see above) was
used to show the relative change in gene expression across the dataset. A heat mapfor the 831 SAM-signi ﬁcant genes is shown in Fig. 3 b. Finally, 29 of those genes were
found (January 2011) to be in a Gene Ontology [18] cluster for skeletal development
(Fig. 3 c).
2.18. Imaging ﬂuorescent PDLLA_BNF
In some cases ( Fig. 4 iek), PDLLA_BNF were doped with Rhodamine-123 (5
mg/
mL in electrospinning solution, Molecular Probes) so that they could be imaged byﬂuorescence microscopy. For 3D renderings in Fig. 4 iej, confocal microscopy images
(Leica TCS SP5 broadband) were collected with a 63 /C2/0.9 water immersion objective
(290 nm Z-step size) for nano ﬁbers (Rhodamine-123) and hBMSC actin (Alexa Fluor
633 phalloidin). For the single Z-slice in Fig. 4 k, a confocal microscopy image (Zeiss
LSM-510) was collected with a 40 /C2/0.80 water immersion objective for nano ﬁbers
(Rhodamine-123) and hBMSC actin (Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin).
3. Results
In order to test if 3D scaffold architecture affects hBMSC
behavior, poly( 3-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds with different
architectures were fabricated by ﬁve different techniques ( Table 1 ):
salt-leaching (PCL_SL), gas-foaming (PCL_GF), gas-foaming phase-separation (PCL_GFPS), electrospinning nano ﬁbers (PCL_BNF) and
freeform fabrication (PCL_FFF). Spun-coat ﬁlms of PCL (PCL_SC)
were used as a ﬂat 2D control for 3Dness. Tissue culture polystyrene
(TCPS) was also used as a control ﬂat surface. Using PCL to fabricate
these different scaffold architectures enables contributions from
material chemistry to be isolated from topographical effects. The
specimens presented a wide variety of morphologies as shown by
the range of structural parameters including porosities and ﬁber
diameters ( Fig. 1 ;Table 2 ).When hBMSCs were cultured on the scaffolds in the absence of
osteogenic supplements (OS), the nano ﬁber scaffolds (PCL_BNF)
induced deposition of a bone-like matrix containing calcium ( Fig. 1 ,
Fig. S1 ). hBMSCs did not produce a calci ﬁed matrix on the other
scaffold types (PCL_SL, PCL_GF, PCL_GFPS, PCL_FFF) or the ﬂat
controls (PCL_SC, TCPS) unless OS were added to the culture
medium. These results suggest that only the nano ﬁbrous scaffolds
can induce hBMSC osteogenesis.
Next, the nano ﬁber effect was investigated more closely and
the effect of nano ﬁb e rd i a m e t e ra n dc h e m i s t r yw e r et e s t e d .
“Small ”diameter 300 nm nano ﬁbers (PCL_SNF) were fabricated
and induced hBMSC osteogenesis in the absence of OS. “Big ”
900 nm nano ﬁbers made from another polymer, poly(
D,L-lactic
acid) (PDLLA_BNF), induced osteogenesis but control ﬂat PDLLA
ﬁlms (PDLLA_SC) did not. When control PCL_BNF were incu-
bated in complete medium without hBMSCs, they did not induce
non-speci ﬁc calcium deposition from medium ( Fig. S1 ). A
summary of all experiments is given in Fig. S8 . These results
indicate that nano ﬁber scaffolds of different sizes (300 nm and
900 nm) and different chemistries (PCL and PDLLA) induced
hBMSC osteogenesis without OS, while ﬂatﬁlms of the same
polymers required OS to support osteogenic differentiation of
hBMSCs.
The effect of scaffold architecture on hBMSC proliferation was
tested using Picogreen DNA assay, ﬂuorescence microscopy and
stereomicroscopy ( Fig. 2 ;Figs. S2 eS5). hBMSCs adhered and
proliferated on all specimens tested (PCL_SL, PCL_GF, PCL_GFPS,
PCL_BNF, PCL_FFF, PCL_SC, TCPS) both in the presence and absence
of osteogenic supplements. For the DNA assay, hBMSC numbers
increased the fastest on PCL_FFF scaffolds (both without and with
OS) and the highest amount of DNA extracted from any specimen
was for PCL_FFF in the presence of OS after 21 d culture ( Fig. 2 ). This
was observed despite the fact that that PCL_SL, PCL_GF, PCL_GFPS,
PCL_BNF, PCL_FFF, PCL_SC and TCPS were seeded with more
hBMSCs (10,000) and were cultured in larger wells (48-well) than
the PCL_FFF (PCL_FFF were seeded with 5000 cells in 96-well
plates). The hBMSCs formed a tissue-like matrix at the strut
joints on the PCL_FFF scaffolds by 21 d as observed in ﬂuorescence
micrographs and stereomicrographs (both without and with OS)
(Fig. 2 ;Figs. S1, S2 and S4 ). By 50 d without OS, a tissue-like matrix
formed a continuous sheet between some struts on the PCL_FFFscaffolds ( Figs. S1c and S2 ). These data indicate that hBMSCs
adhered and proliferated on all substrates tested (PCL_SL, PCL_GF,
PCL_GFPS, PCL_BNF, PCL_FFF, PCL_SC, TCPS) but that PCL_FFF scaf-
folds supported the most hBMSC proliferation.
The effect of scaffold architecture on hBMSC gene expression
was assessed using microarrays (mRNA). A dendrogram resulting
from cluster analysis ( Fig. 3 a) plus heat maps of the expression
level for signi ﬁcantly regulated genes ( Fig. 3 b) are shown. Heat
maps of the signi ﬁcantly regulated genes involved in skeletalTable 1

indicated that hBMSC gene expression at 14 d on the nano ﬁber
specimens correlated most closely with the osteogenic control
treatments. Thus, Node A (TCPS þOS 14d: hBMSCs cultured 14 d in
OS on TCPS) and Node B (14d nano ﬁber specimens: PCL_BNF,PCL_SNF, PDLLA_BNF) grouped together under Node C. These data
indicate that nano ﬁber scaffolds induced a gene expression
signature that was similar to that induced by OS, further sup-
porting the observation that culture of hBMSCs on nano ﬁbrous
scaffolds induces hBMSC osteogenesis.

Biomaterials (2011), doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.054It is also astonishing that for the different treatments, the 4
replicates group together almost exclusively ( Fig. 3 a). Indeed, only
three treatments (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 3 ) would need to
be relocated to give perfect segregation by treatment in the
dendrogram. Also, all 14 d ﬂat specimens (TCPS, PCL_SC, PDLLA_SC)
group together under node D, indicating that the hBMSCs can sense
the 2-dimensionality of these substrates. For these experiments,
specimen architecture was more important than surface chemistry,since PCL_SC grouped with the other 2D specimens (PDLLA_SC,
TCPS) instead of with other PCL specimens. Likewise, PDLLA_SC
grouped with the other 2D specimens (PCL_SC, TCPS) instead of with
the other PDLLA specimen (PDLLA_BNF). These results indicate that
hBMSCS are exquisitely sensitive to scaffold structure resulting in
au n i q u eg e n ee x p r e s s i o np r o ﬁle for each type of scaffold tested. The
results also suggest that scaffold structure has a bigger in ﬂuence on
stem cell behavior than does polymer chemistry.
The ability of nano ﬁbers to drive osteogenic differentiation of
hBMSCs was investigated further to understand the mechanism.
Fluorescence micrographs suggested that cell shape could be
driving osteogenesis on nano ﬁber scaffolds. hBMSCs assumed
a spindly, highly branched morphology on PCL_BNF which was very
different than the well spread morphology observed for ﬂatﬁlms
(PCL_SC) ( Figs. S2 eS4). Since cell morphology is tightly linked to
cell function [19,20] , this possibility was investigated further using
high resolution confocal microscopy to quantify and compare cell
morphology on PCL nano ﬁbers (PCL_BNF) and ﬁlms (PCL_SC) after
1 d culture ( Fig. 4 ,Fig. S7 ). hBMSCs cultured on PCL_BNF had
smaller cell area, higher aspect ratio, lower roundness and more
branching than did hBMSCs on PCL_SC. Strikingly, hBMSCs culturedon PCL_SC in the presence of OS also took on a spindly, branchedTable 2

elongated, highly branched hBMSC morphologies induced osteo-
genesis regardless of whether morphological changes were drivenby scaffold architecture (nano ﬁber scaffolds) or by biochemical
supplements (OS).
Confocal 3D renderings of hBMSCs on ﬂuorescent nano ﬁber
scaffolds show that the hBMSCs penetrate into the nano ﬁber scaf-
folds ( Fig. 4 iej). In addition, the hBMSCs extended projections that
follow along the individual nano ﬁbers resulting in the elongated,
branched hBMSC morphology ( Fig. 4 k). The hBMSCs cannot attach
to the aqueous medium in the voids between the nano ﬁbers and
have no choice but to adhere to the nano ﬁbers, which forces theminto and elongated and highly branched morphology. Taken
together, these results suggest that the intrinsic structure of the
nano ﬁber scaffolds forces the hBMSCs into an osteogenic
morphology that drives their osteogenic differentiation.
4. Discussion
The cluster analysis dendrogram ( Fig. 3 ) is powerful because it
provides an unbiased approach of sorting scaffold treatments
according to gene expression patterns. The analysis considers all
genes and does not focus on pre-selected markers. In addition, this
approach provides a unique way to analyze cell ematerial interactions

Biomaterials (2011), doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.054where the sorting of the treatments provides insight into which
material properties are in ﬂuencing cell fate. In Fig. 3 a, the different
scaffold treatments sort by scaffold structure over scaffold composi-
tion, suggesting that scaffold structure has a greater ability to control
cell fate than does composition. Combining the microarray cluster
analysis with the scaffold library approach, where many types of
scaffold architectures are systematically compared side-by-side,
robustly demonstrates that cells are more sensitive to scaffold
structure than previously appreciated.
Although the advantages of nano ﬁber scaffolds for tissue engi-
neering are well-documented and their ability to promote osteo-
genesis has been demonstrated [21e23], the mechanism for these
effects has not been de ﬁned. The current scaffold library results
further emphasize the ability of nano ﬁbers to induce osteogenesis
by systematically comparing multiple scaffold architectures side by
side. A nano ﬁbrous topography was key since only the nano ﬁber
scaffolds, of all the scaffold morphologies that were tested (SL, GF,
GFPS, NF, FFF), induced osteogenic differentiation. In addition, the
current results provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of
nano ﬁbers. Nano ﬁbers provided ﬁbrous adhesion sites for the
hBMSCs that caused the hBMSCs to take on an elongated, highlybranched morphology which drove them down and osteogenic
lineage ( Fig. 4 ). The current experiments suggest that the osteoin-
ductive effects of nano ﬁbers come from their ability to force cells
into an osteogenic morphology.
Decellularized extracellular matrices (dECM) have been very
successful as tissue engineering scaffolds and collagen nano ﬁbers
are the dominant structure of dECM [24e27]. Synthetic polymer
nano ﬁber scaffolds such as PCL_BNF mimic the structure of the
collagen nano ﬁbers present in dECM [11]. The current results
suggest that the dECM scaffolds may be effective because their
nano ﬁbrous structure drives cells into morphologies that enhance
their differentiation. It will be interesting to see if this holds true in
future work.
It is well-established that cell morphology and cell function are
strongly linked [19,20] and that this principle applies to hBMSC
osteogenesis [28e30]. McBeath et al. demonstrated that modula-
tion of hBMSC shape with surface patterning could be used to
switch hBMSC differentiation between osteogenic or adipogenic
[28]. In addition, Rodriguez et al. observed that osteogenic
supplements caused changes in hBMSC morphology [29]. In vivo,
hBMSCs progress to osteoblasts and then to mature osteocytes.
While osteoblasts are cuboidal, osteocytes are highly branched,
residing in lacunae and radiating multiple extensions down
canaliculi [31]. Thus, nano ﬁber scaffolds may force the hBMSCs into
a highly branched “
osteocyte-like ”morphology, which pushes the
hBMSCs toward an osteogenic lineage.
The data suggest that scaffolds should be designed to drive cells
into morphologies that will induce the desired cell function
(proliferation, migration, differentiation, etc.). Models for cell
spreading could be adapted to predict cell shape on different 3D
structures. Alternatively, more extensive libraries of 3D structures
could be probed for their effect on cell shape and function to create
a catalog of scaffold structures versus cell shape/behavior. Coupling
scaffold structure to cell shape could yield new targets for scaffold
design that could enhance the inherent regenerative capabilities ofscaffolds.
5. Conclusions
A systematic comparison of multiple scaffold types highlights the
unexpected sensitivity that cells have for scaffold structure. hBMSCs
took on a unique gene expression pro ﬁle on each type of scaffold
structure tested demonstrating that hBMSCs are highly responsive to
scaffold architecture. In addition, the effect of scaffold structure onstem cell behavior was mediated by cell shape. Nano ﬁbers scaffolds
induced osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs by forcing the cells into
an elongated, highly-branched, osteogenic morphology. These
results advance our understanding of how scaffold architecture can
control cell fates. The data suggest a new paradigm for improving 3D
tissue scaffold ef ﬁcacy where the structure of the scaffold can be
designed to drive cells into morphologies that direct their differen-
tiation down a desired lineage.
