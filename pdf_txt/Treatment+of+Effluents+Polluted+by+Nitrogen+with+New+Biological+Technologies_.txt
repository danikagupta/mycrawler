Abstract: Nitrogen is a main contaminant of wast ewater worldwide. Novel processes for 
nitrogen removal have been de veloped over the last several decades. One of these is the 
partial nitritation process. Th is process includes the oxida tion of ammonium to nitrite 
without the generation of nitrat e. The partial nitritation process has se veral advantages over 
traditional nitrification-denitrification processe s for nitrogen removal from wastewaters. In 
addition, partial nitritation is required fo r anammox elimination of nitrogen from 
wastewater. Partial nitritation is affected by operational conditions a nd substances present 
in the influent, such as quinolone antibiotics. In this review, the impact that several 
operational conditions, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen c oncentration, hydraulic 
retention time and solids retention time, have over the partial nitritation process is covered. 
The effect of quinolone antibioti cs and other emerging contamin ants are discussed. Finally, 
future perspectives for the partial nitritation process are commented upon.

 1. Introduction 
One of the most important environmental problems t oday is the discharge of wastewater from urban 
and industrial sources, since human activities have greatly accelerated  and extended the natural cycles 
of nitrogen in the soil, water and atmosphere. In this  way, different technologies  have been used for the 
removal of different environmental pollutants, such as nitrogen, organi c matter and phosphorus. In 
wastewater treatment plants, nitr ogen is often removed by conventiona l biological processes, such as 
nitrification and heterotr ophic denitrification. In pa rticular, the conventional processes are not suitable 
for the treatment of effluents, such as a dewateri ng concentrate stream, due to their toxic effects to 
those microorganisms able to degrade the nitroge n. For this reason, alternative systems have been 
developed for the removal of this nutrient, such as partial nitritation/anaerobic ammonium oxidation 
(anammox) technology. Thanks to these novel tec hnologies, high ammonium-l ow carbon effluents, 
such as reject water from anaerobi c digesters, can be treated with in the sludge pipeline, therefore 
avoiding its treatment within th e activated sludge processes. 
Antimicrobial agents are among the most comm only used pharmaceuticals. However, although 
antibiotics are of great importance for human hea lth, they can also be a great problem for the 
environment. During wastewater treatment, antibiot ics are drastically remove d from the water stream, 
but their fate is associated with sewage sludge. In this sense, the biological processes of nitritation 
have been described as particularly  sensitive to toxic substances, su ch as pesticides and antibiotics. 
The partial nitritation process is a technique in whic h nitrification is achieved with nitrite as the 
intermediate under stable processi ng conditions, where only 50% of th e ammonium in the influent is 
converted into nitrite. This system and its combin ation with the anammox process have led to the 
development of a new technology of great interest in th e treatment of effluent with high nitrogen content. 
The results obtained in partial nitritation bior eactors show that modifications to the operating 
conditions can dramatically affect the functioning of  the partial nitritation technology. Specifically, a 
significant factor that produces changes in the microbial communities is hydraulic retention time 
(HRT) [1]. Thus, changes in the operating conditions , such as HRT, may produce changes in cellular 
physiology and the community leve l. Consequently, the performan ce of the biotransformation of 
ammonium into nitrite in a partial nitritation bioreact or can be directly affected by the HRT, which can 
be crucial for the optimization of nutrient removal rates and the implem entation of control strategies.  
Antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, have been repor ted [2,3] as able to im pact the performance of 
the partial nitritation process, suggesting that there is a negative correlation between antibiotic 
concentration in the influent an d performance of the partial nitr itation process. Fu rthermore, the 
microbial community inside the bi oreactors suffers a period of adap tation or a deep change with a 
significant reduction of the ammonium-oxidizing bacteria  in response to the antibiotic concentration in 
the influent [3]. Additionally, the presence of an tibiotics in the bioreactor increases the number of 
antibiotic-resistant bact eria. In this way, it could be suggested that the presence of selected antibiotics, 
such as quinolones, can seriously affect partial nitritation system s and select microorganisms with 
antibiotic resistance [3]. 
The objective of our article is to evaluate the infl uence of different environmental parameters, such 
as HRT, and the concentration of fluoroquinolone an tibiotics on the performanc e of partial nitritation Water 2014 , 6 1907 
 
 systems. We also review the effects of these pa rameters on the microbial communities growing in 
bioreactors using molecu lar biology techniques.  
2. Partial Nitritation Process: An Overview 
Contamination caused by wastewater discharge has increased during the last decades, due to the 
increasing global popula tion [1]. Nitrogen, one of th e main contaminants of wastewater, has been identified 
to cause oxygen depletion and eutrophication in a quatic environments [4]. Wa stewater engineering has 
traditionally removed nitroge n from wastewater through  complete nitrification-denitrification processing 
to meet the water quality criteria for treated wastewat er [1]. More restrictive standards for nitrogen in 
wastewater effluent are being im posed by new regulations, such as the European Union (EU) Water 
Frame Directive 91/271/EEC (Table 1). To achieve these standards in  a cost-effective way, autotrophic 
nitrogen removal technologies, such as partial nitritation/anaer obic ammonium oxidation (anammox), 
DEMON (deammonification), OLAND (oxygen limited auto trophic nitrification/de nitrification), and 
CANON (completely autotrophic nitrogen-removal over nitrate) [5,6], have been developed. 
Autotrophic nitrogen removal technologies are ba sed on anammox bacteria, which can eliminate 
nitrogen by utilizing ammonium as a substrate and nitrite as the terminal el ectron acceptor in molar 
ratios of 1:1 [7]. These technologie s have been successfully utilized at  full-scale wastewater treatment 
plants for the treatment of reject  water from anaerobic digesters (e .g., the partial nitration/anammox 
process at Rotterdam wastewater treatment pl ant (WWTP) and the DEMON process at Apeldoorn 
WWTP and the CANON process at  Olburgen WWTP, all located in The Netherlands). Anammox 
technologies can save up to 90% of costs with respect  to traditional nitrification-denitrification processes 
for influents with a hi gh ammonium concentration and low carbon content [8 ]. Among these 
technologies, the partial nitritation/anammox system  has been developed as a two-step autotrophic 
nitrogen removal process. The first step involves the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite under aerobic 
conditions in such a way that roughl y 50% of ammonium is oxidized [8]. This is achieved with partial 
nitritation technology. Today, there are six examples  of full-scale partial nitritation plants in The 
Netherlands and one in the USA [9].

samples when the temperature from the effluent in the biological reactor is higher than or equal to 12 °C. The conditions concerning temperature could be replaced by a limitation on the time of operation to account for regional climatic conditions. Water 2014 , 6 1908 
 
 In a partial nitritation system, ammo nium is oxidized to nitrite (Figur e 1). Partial nitritation systems 
were developed by the Delft Univ ersity of Technology in 1996–1999 [11]  and have several advantages 
over total nitritation-based technolo gies, such as 25% savings in ae ration, 30% reduction of biomass 
generation, with a biomass yield of about 0.15 g biomass (g NH 4+-N)−1 [12], and 20% less CO 2  
emission [11]. Partial nitritation bioreactors at the la boratory scale have been reported to successfully 
treat food processing and agricult ure industry wastewater, reject  wastewater and slaughterhouse 
wastewater or swine manure wa stewater, among others [13–19].

Within a partial nitritation reactor, the main perfo rmance is the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite, 
and therefore, there is an accumu lation of nitrite in the system. Although nitrite has b een thought not to 
accumulate in ecosystems, some reports show that it can accumulate in natural and engineered 
environments, such as soils, sediments and wastewater treatment plants [20]. This is achieved by the 
metabolism of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). 
AOB use ammonium mono-oxida se (AMO) enzyme to oxidize ammonium to hydroxylamine 
(NH 2OH), using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Following this reaction, hydroxylamine is  
oxidized to nitrite with the mediation of hydroxyl amine oxidoreductase (HAO) , with hydrazine as an 
intermediate [11,21]. AOB are au totrophic microorganisms, so they utilize inorganic carbon as a 
carbon source. AOB comm unities belong to the β-Proteobacteria class,  with species like Nitrosomonas sp., 
Nitrosospira sp., Nitrosolobus sp. and Nitrosovibrio sp., among others (Table 2) . It has also been 
found that Nitrosomonas  and Nitrosospira  are the most popular genera  among partial nitritation 
reactors, with Nitrosospira  dominating under high-ammonium conditio ns [22]. Two different types of 
AOB bacteria have been differentiated so fa r: fast-growing AOB and slow-growing AOB. The 
difference between these two groups resides in th e affinity for ammonium, which is higher in  
slow-growing AOB. Thus, slow-g rowing AOB, k-strategists, dominate in environments with an 
ammonium limitation. In partial nitritation react ors, the ammonium concentration is high, and 
therefore, fast-growing AOB, r-str ategists, dominate [23]. Even t hough it is known that species of 
AOB can carry out denitrifying metabolism that reduc es nitrite to nitric oxide, nitrous oxide and 
dinitrogen [9], it is thought that AOB only perform ammonium oxidation in partial nitritation reactors. NH4 +

Nevertheless, AOB have to compete with other microbial communities inside a partial nitritation 
reactor. The main competitors of AOB are nitrite- oxidizing bacteria (NOB),  which utilize oxygen for 
the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate (Table 2). As  NOB metabolism utilizes nitrite as the metabolic 
substrate under aerobic conditions, partial nitritation systems represen t viable environments for NOB 
to develop. The most common NOB species isolated from  activated sludge systems belong to the 
genera, Rubrivivax , Rhodobacter  and Pseudomonas  [32,33]. NOB population development is the 
major problem related to partial nitritation operati onal performance. It has been stated that the 
achievement of the desired ammonium oxidation of a partial nitritation bior eactor depends on the 
understanding of the AOB and NOB community structur e and the effect of ope rational conditions on 
AOB and NOB community dynamics [34]. If NOB co mmunities are uncontrolle d, nitrate will appear, 
due to complete nitritation of ammonium wh en ammonium loading declines from 0.5 kg N m−3 day−1, 
with the consequent loss in the performance of the system. Therefore, controlling the NOB population 
is needed in order to achieve the desired nitrog en removal [11,22]. The different characteristics of 
AOB and NOB have been studied in order to develop strategies for NOB control in partial nitritation 
systems. These are based on temperature, dissolved  oxygen, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and solid 
retention time (SRT), or free ammonia (FA) a nd free nitrous acid (FNA) concentrations, among  
others [14,24,35,36]. When 50% ammonium is oxi dized under steady-stat e conditions, partial 
nitritation reactors have a re lative abundance of 64% AOB a nd less than 5% NOB [37]. 
3. Effect of Operational Condition s and Quinolone Antibiotic over the Partial Nitritation Process 
3.1. Effect of Influent Characteristics  
Partial nitritation reactors have been developed for the treatment of wastewater with low organic 
matter content and high concentrations  of ammonium (Figure 2). The ef fects that different substances 
present in wastewater, such as ammonium and orga nic matter, have on the partial nitritation process 
have been extensively investigated.

The ammonia loading rate (ALR) has been shown to affect the chemical composition of the effluent 
generated in a partial nitritation reactor. In a cont inuously-stirred tank reacto r (CSTR) configuration, at 
an ALR from 1.04 N-NH 4+ m−3 day−1 to 1.81 N-NH 4+ m−3 day−1, the composition of the effluent was 
stable and dominated by nitrite and ammonia, at a ratio of  about 1.2:1, with a sm all fraction of nitrogen 
present as nitrate. A similar trend was observed in a biofilm reactor configuration at the ALR range of 
2.15 to 4.07 N-NH 4+ m−3 day−1. This effluent composition was suitable for a further anammox 
treatment for nitrogen elimination. Lower ALRs lead to  an excess of nitrate in the effluent for this 
purpose, and higher ALRs achieve an excess of amm onia in the effluent. In this way, ALR has been 
proposed as a practical way to co ntrol the performance of partial nitritation reactors and has been 
claimed to be more practical than other control st rategies, such as dissolved  oxygen (DO) control [38]. 
Ammonium concentration has been shown to affect  the performance of partial nitritation reactors, 
due to the production of FA and FNA. Both AOB  and NOB can be inhibited by their metabolic 
substrates and/or by-pro ducts. It has been found that FA and FNA can inhibit AOB and NOB [39–41]. 
In any case, NOB are much more sensitive than AOB . The activity of NOB becomes inhibited at FNA 
concentrations from 0.26 mg HNO 2-N L−1 [42], which is lower than th e inhibition concentration for 
AOB, 0.49 mg HNO 2-N L−1 [41]. Inhibition by FNA is related to the donation of a proton to the 
electron transport chain, which impedes the transmem brane pH gradient for the synthesis of ATP [21]. 
NOB is inhibited by FA at concentr ations ranging from 1 to 7 mg NH 3-N L−1, while AOB starts to be 
inhibited at 150 mg NH 3-N L−1 [11]. Other authors have proposed different thresholds for the FA 
inhibition of NOB (1.75 mg NH 3-N L−1) [42] and AOB (605 mg NH 3-N L−1) [41]. Inhibition of NOB 
by FA is thought to result from the competition of FA with nitrite oxide reductase (NOR), an NOB 
enzyme involved in the oxidation of nitrite to n itrate [21]. It has been stated that AOB become 
inhibited by FA and FNA when nitrogen loading rates become higher than 1.5 kg/m−3 day−1 [43]. 
Regardless of this, the adaptation of NOB and AOB communities to FA concentrations has been 
Water 2014 , 6 1911 
 
 widely covered by severa l authors [44–46]. Some Nitrobacter spp. strains, typical NOB in partial 
nitritation reactors, have been found to resist up to 40 mg NH 3-N L−1 FA [11], while AOB 
communities have been acclimated to FA concentrations of 122 –224 mg L−1 [24]. Therefore, control 
based on FA concentrations might not be an effi cient, practical tool for the assessment of the 
performance of partial nitritation systems. 
Hydroxylamine, an intermediate in the oxidation of ammonium to n itrite, was reported to have the 
capability of stabilizing a partial nitritation sy stem operating at a high chemical oxygen demand to 
nitrogen (COD/N) ratio, low temperature and high DO concentration, due to its inhibitory effect on 
NOB populations [47]. Hydroxylamin e has an inhibitory effect on NOB communities at 250 µM and 
on AOB populations at 2,000 µM; therefore, it se lects for AOB to thrive in the system [11]. 
A certain amount of organic matter can enter a partia l nitritation reactor with  the influent. Organic 
matter entering a partial nitritation reactor affects its performance. On e of the reasons is that organic 
matter favors the development of heterotrophs, wh ich have a shorter duplication time than AOB  
and could therefore outcompete them for oxygen inside  the bioreactor [48]. It has been reported that 
the stability of the partial nitritation process is disturbed by high COD/N rati os, due to the promotion 
of heterotrophic bacteria inside the system [49]. It has been shown that the C/N ratio does not  
affect the performance of the partial nitritation process at ammonium volumetric loading rates of  
0.5 kg N-NH 4+ m−3 day−1. At higher ammonium volumetric load ing rates, higher C/ N ratios require 
higher DO concentrations if the same ammonium oxida tion efficiency is desired [24]. In spite of the 
promotion of heterotrophic growth, the impact of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration on a partial 
nitritation system has been found to  depend on carbon concentration.  It has been reported that TOC 
concentrations are 0.2 g TOC L−1, as acetate stimulates ammonium oxidation in partial nitritation 
reactors, but also 0.3 g TOC L−1, as acetate decreases 10% ammonium conversion in these systems [6]. 
Another impact of organic matter on partia l nitritation reactors is related to the  
carbonate-bicarbonate-carbon dioxide equilibrium. W ith the development of heterotrophs in the 
partial nitritation reactor, carbon dioxide is generate d in the system. Given the pH range in which 
partial nitritation reactors operate ( 6.6–8.0), the equilibrium will select for HCO 3 as the dominant 
form of inorganic carbon. Carbonate will acidify the medium, thus reducing its capacity to balance the 
release of protons taking place during ammonium oxi dation. Therefore, the addition of organic matter 
will lead to lower conversion rate s of ammonium to  nitrate [36]. 
In spite of this fact, it has been proven that th e elimination of organic matter can be achieved in 
partial nitritation reactors at the same time as a mmonium oxidation when car bon loading rates do not 
exceed 2 kg m−3 day−1 [48]. Accordingly, it has been proposed  that, for the purpose of an anammox 
treatment train, a pa rtial nitritation process following an an ammox reactor is recommended when the 
influent contains a considerable amount of orga nic matter, which suggests the ability of partial 
nitritation systems to handle peaks of organic loading while maintaining a stable operational state [50]. 
In spite of this capacity, it has been found that the r ecovery of partial nitritati on reactors after excessive 
loading of organic matter is a long process [42]. 
The addition of certain organic and inorganic compounds could play an importa nt role in partial 
nitritation processes. It has been f ound that fulvic acid impacts nitrite  accumulation in partial nitritation 
reactors, impeding ammonium  oxidation when its concentration is below 0.002 mg L−1 or over  
0.07 mg L−1. It has also been reported that NOB are mo re sensitive than AOB to ortho-cresol, aniline Water 2014 , 6 1912 
 
 and phenol. ClO 2− has been proven to inhibit NOB activity at 3 mM; thus, chlorine could be used as a 
control strategy for NOB popul ation development [21]. 
3.2. Effect of Temperature  
Temperature shows a clear relationship with ammoni um oxidation in partial nitritation systems. It 
has been reported that, at a cons tant ammonium volumetric loading rate and DO concentration, higher 
temperatures lead to higher ammonium oxidation up to 35 °C. Beyond this point, higher temperatures 
lead to FA formation, and the activity of AOB become s inhibited [24]. In similar studies, it was found 
that at 25 °C, ammonium oxidation reached values  of up to 60% of those at 28–39 °C. At 41 °C, 
bacterial activity stops, and thus , ammonium oxidation does not take  place. Furthermore, it has been 
observed that the ammonium uptake rate in partial nitritation reactors is maximum in the temperature 
range of 33–37 °C [51]. 
The bacterial community structure of partial nitr itation reactors seems not to be influenced by 
temperature. Therefore, a difference in microbial ac tivity due to temperature has been proposed as an 
explanation of differences in the performance of  the system at different temperatures [52]. 
It has been found that NOB have  slower growth rates than AOB  when temperatures go up from  
24 °C, while at temperatures as low as 15 °C, NOB  attain domination over AOB in partial nitritation 
reactors [15,21]. It was reported th at temperatures above 30 °C led to a prevalence of AOB over NOB, 
due to the faster growth rate of the former, so op erating at temperatures higher than 30 °C will select 
for AOB [53]. 
Furthermore, the effect of temperature on the perf ormance of a partial nitr itation reactor has been 
explained by the formation of FA and FNA, due to  shifts in the concentrations of FA and FNA 
produced in partial nitritation systems. In this way, while the FA concentration increases with 
temperature, from about 20 mg/L at 25 °C to 1 20 mg/L at 35 °C, FNA shows the opposite behavior, 
with 0.5 mg/L at 25 °C and 0.1 mg/L at 35 °C. Thus, at low temperatures, FNA is the main inhibitor of 
AOB, while at high temperatures, it is the co mbination of FA and FNA that inhibits  
ammonium oxidation [54]. 
In practice, partial nitritation re actors are commonly operated in th e range of 30–35 °C to ensure 
that AOB outcompetes NOB [54]. However, even t hough partial nitritation react ors have been widely 
operated at 35 °C, there is not much  difference in the practical opera tion between 25 °C and 35 °C in 
terms of growth of AOB and NOB;  in practical operation, 25 °C is considered enough for the purpose 
of NOB control [21]. 
3.3. Effect of pH and DO  
The pH in a partial nitritation reactor has an impact on its performance. In fact, pH has been 
reported as a key parameter affectin g influent quality in models for laboratory-scale partial nitritation 
bioreactors [55]. It has been proposed that the influence of pH on ammonium oxidation in partial 
nitritation reactors is driven by th ree processes: activation and deac tivation of nitrifying enzymes; 
changes in inorganic carbon concen trations; and changes in FA and FNA concentrations [20,56]. At 
higher pH, carbonate and bicarbonate are present at higher concentratio ns, and thus, the buffer capacity 
of the system increases. On the contrary, as the pH drops below 7.7, the equilibrium tends to carbon Water 2014 , 6 1913 
 
 dioxide, leading to a loss of buffe r capacity [36]. High pH has been related to the formation of FA, 
which is the primary substrate for AOB, and has also  been related to a decr ease in FNA concentration, 
which is the primary substrate of NOB communities [38]. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated 
that nitrification does not occur belo w pH 6 [11,20]. Therefore, control of the pH in partial nitritation 
systems can select for AOB and inhibit NOB, due  to the formation of FA and the limitation  
of FNA [45,57]. 
It has been reported that the optimal pH for Nitrosomonas spp., typical AOB, ranges between 7.9 
and 8.2 and that for Nitrobacter  spp., typical NOB, it ranges between  7.2 and 7.6, while the optimal pH 
for partial nitritation reactor operation ranges be tween 7.0 and 8.0 [11,38]. The higher tolerance of 
AOB to low pH is thought to result from their ab ility to develop thick extracellular polymeric 
substance (EPS) layers [58]. 
DO concentrations have an impact on the performan ce of a partial nitritati on reactor. It has been 
found that ammonium oxidation increases with DO c oncentration, regardless of the C/N ratio, for the 
same ammonium volumetric loading rate [24]. 
Half saturation constant values  for oxygen of AOB and NOB were  reported to be 0.2–0.4 mg L−1 
and 1.2–1.5 mg L−1, respectively, which supports the hypothesis of the lower affinity for oxygen of 
NOB than AOB [11,21]. Following this, oxygen limitation inside partial nitritation reactors is an 
efficient way to control NOB development. Some studi es state that the growth rate of AOB is higher 
than that of NOB when DO con centrations drop below 1 mg L−1 [22]. Therefore, DO concentrations 
lower than 1 mg L−1 are used to control NOB in partial nitritation reactors [59,60]. The accumulation 
of nitrite can be controlled in a short time by setting DO concentration to 0.4–0.8 mg L−1. Furthermore, 
at DO concentrations of 2 mg L−1 or higher, a substantial accumulation of nitrate occurs in partial 
nitritation bioreactors [49] . Some authors used aeration of lower than 0.1 (m air3 day−1)/(kg N m−3 day−1) 
in order to control nitrate accumulation [22]. In addition, low DO concentrations are related to 
increasing NO and N 2O emissions [11]. 
Partial nitritation processes have been repor ted as responsible for the emissions of CH 4 and N 2O to 
the atmosphere [61–6 4]. Even though CH 4 emissions have been related to soluble CH 4 stripped from reject 
wastewater treated in par tial nitritation systems, N 2O emissions have been correlated with DO 
concentration. In this way, higher DO concentrations inside the bioreactor will decrease the %N 2O/N oxidized  
ratio. When normal operatio n parameters were used, emissions of 19.3% ± 7.5%N 2O/N oxidized  were found 
for a partial nitritation sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process [65]. 
3.4. Effect of HRT and SRT  
It has been reported that Nitrosomonas spp., typical AOB [24], have a maximum growth rate of 
0.54 ± 0.09 day−1, while Nitrobacter spp., typical NOB [24], have a maximum growth rate of  
0.67 ± 0.03 day−1 [66]. Other authors have reported sim ilar values for a minimum doubling time of 
AOB (7–8 h) and NOB (10–13 h) [21]. Given the s horter doubling time of AOB  compared with NOB, 
control of NOB populations can be ac hieved with the utilization of the HRT/SRT. If HRT is set shorter 
than the AOB doubling time, then no ammonium oxida tion will occur, and if HRT is set longer than 
the NOB doubling time, then the system will under go nitrate generation. For this reason, SRT should 
be set longer than the AOB doubling time, but shorte r than the NOB doubling time.  In addition to this, Water 2014 , 6 1914 
 
 partial nitritation bioreactors will avoid sludge rete ntion, given that the recycl ing of biomass will make 
NOB persist in the system and, therefore, develop in  it. For this reason, partia l nitritation reactors are 
generally operated without sludge retention [8]. 
Conventionally, HRT and SRT are set up to be th e same time in partia l nitritation reactors. 
However, the development of non-coupled HRT a nd SRT partial nitritation bioreactors has been 
attempted by biofilter partial nitritation reactors. By  setting up a biofilter process, SRT is increased 
with respect to HRT. It has been confirmed that  biotransformation of ammonium to nitrite is  
three-times higher in biofilter partial nitritati on reactors than in conventional partial  
nitritation reactors [1]. 
The impact of HRT on partial nitritation reactors  has been evaluated by se veral authors. It was 
found that higher HRTs, at the same SRTs, led to  higher oxidation of amm onium to nitrite [1,25,37]. 
Differences in ammonium oxidation at different HRTs are due to di fferences in microbial community 
structure inside the bioreactor at these HRTs. Differe nces in bacterial diversity have been reported in 
biofilter partial nitritation reactors for diffe rent HRTs. Within long HRTs of 12 h, the dominant 
phylotypes are Nitrosomonas europaea  and Nitrosomonas eutropha , with the importance of 
Diaphorobacter sp. At moderately long HRTs of  9 h, the domina nt species are N. europaea , Nitrosospira 
spp., and Paracoccus spp., with the presence of Nitrosovibrio spp., Rhodobacter spp. and 
Catellibacterium spp. [1,25]. A decrease in microbial diversit y at high HRTs due to competition for 
ammonium has been observed, which links bacteria l community structure to  ammonium oxidation in 
partial nitritation reactors [1]. At high HRTs, the ammonium loadi ng rate decreases in the system. 
Under these conditions, ammonium is scarce and bacteria with hi gh affinity for ammonium will 
rapidly thrive inside the bi oreactor, outcompeting other bacteria with  a lower affinity for this substrate. 
The selection of bacteria with high ammonium affinity will increase the biotransformation rate of the 
system. Therefore, control of a biofilter partial ni tritation reactor can be achieved by changing the HRT 
of the system [1]. 
The SRT also has an influence on bacterial commun ities in partial nitritation reactors. As a main 
control of NOB in the system, the SRT should be se t lower than the duplica tion time of NOB, thus 
ensuring the washout of these bacteria from the react or [8]. Nevertheless, a short SRT also leads to a 
loss of AOB biomass. In this way, partial nitritat ion reactors have been conventionally operated as 
suspended growth processes [30,67,68]. On the other ha nd, it has been confirmed that attached growth 
partial nitritation processes with attached/granula r biomass have advantages over suspended growth 
partial nitritation pr ocesses, such as enhanced AOB biofilm fo rmation [69]. Attached growth processes 
for partial nitritation systems have been successfully ap plied at the pilot-plant scale [1,5]. An efficient, 
stable, 50%–50% ammonium–nitrate ratio in the efflue nt has been achieved at optimum HRTs of  
7 h [5]. In this sense, it can be said that HRTs lo wer than 7 h could not achiev e the oxidation of half of 
the influent ammonium, with the c onsequent failure of the operation of the system. An analysis of 
bacterial community dynamics at shorter HRTs has no t been attempted to date  in biofilter partial 
nitritation reactors. It has been proven that att ached growth processes offer up to 100-times higher 
biomass retention and 10-times lower loss of biomass and require a lower HRT than suspended  
growth processes [70].

 3.5. Effect of Salinity, Starvation of  Biomass and Emerging Contaminants  
Salinity affects the performance of partial nitritation systems. It has been conc luded that concentrations 
of 85 mM NaCl increases ammonium conversion by up to 30%. As  the NaCl concentr ation rises, the 
system loses stimulation and tends to similar values of performance as those for the no-salinity scenario. 
Nevertheless, at NaCl conc entrations of 256 mM and hi gher, the system loses the capacity for ammonium 
oxidation. At 342 mM NaCl, ammonium oxidation in the system is 70% less compared with no-salinity 
operation [4]. The se nsitivity of AOB has been id entified after short-term e xposure to salinity, but the 
adaptation of N. europaea  strains to high salini ty conditions has also  been observed [71,72]. 
The bacterial dynamics of AOB and NOB communities inside a partial nitritation biorea ctor subjected 
to a long period of starvation were  studied [73]. When the feed of a partial nitritation reactor ceases, 
ammonium availability star ts to decrease due to AOB activity, until all of the ammonium has been 
oxidized. At this point, due to the lack of subs trate, AOB communities exhibit a sharp decrease in relative 
abundance, from 77% to less than 1%. On the othe r hand, NOB communities gain relative abundance 
due to the availability of nitrite ex creted by AOB. This trend stops when  all of the nitrite is consumed 
within the system. When the starvation period ceases and the bioreactor is subj ected to a regular feed 
again, AOB communities deve lop rapidly, achieving a st eady state similar to that  before the starvation 
period after 15 days. 
Emerging contaminants (ECs) have been proposed as particular pollutants that , in fact, have never 
been studied before [74]. They came to the attention of the scientific community recently and are different from traditional pollutants. Contaminan ts of emerging concern today include pharmaceutical 
products, plasticizers, flame retardants, new- generation pesticides, cyanotoxins and more. 
Pharmaceuticals have been reported as some of the most important ECs. They are present in urban 
and industrial wastewater treatment systems all ar ound the world (an example from the analysis of 
pharmaceuticals from three wastewater treatment pl ants of Catalonia region, Spain, is given in  
Table 3) and have been targeted as contaminants of emerging concern [1]. As an example, different 
antibiotics have been detected at  concentrations of up to 450 ng L
−1 in urban wastewater treatment 
plants [75]. In this context, it ha s been reported that the partial ni tritation process ca n be drastically 
inhibited by quinolone antibiotics, su ch as ciprofloxacin [76]. Quinol one antibiotics have been found 
in influent urban wastewater in conc entrations ranging up to 426 ng/L [3]. 
As indicated above, the effect of ciprofloxacin on the performa nce and the bacterial community 
dynamics of a partial nitritation reactor has been studied [3]. Ciprofloxacin at 100 ng L−1 impacts the 
performance of the system, which loses 40% capacity of ammonium conversion during the first several 
days, but stabilizes within a month, showing a more efficient conversion of ammonium than before the 
antibiotic addition. On th e other hand, concentrations up of 350 ng L−1 ciprofloxacin drastically reduce 
ammonium oxidation, by 70%, during the first severa l days. When the system  stabilizes, ammonium 
conversion recovers, but the performa nce reached is 30% lower compared with that at the beginning of 
the experiment. Biomass in the system decreases when ciprofloxacin is added, by about 40% for  
100 ng L−1 and 60% for 350 ng L−1, but at the end of the experiment, there is a net increase in the 
biomass (5% for the lower concentration and 80% fo r the higher concentration). In the case of  
100 ng L−1 ciprofloxacin, bacterial community dynamics  start with a decrea se of the relative 
abundance of AOB and end with a s light net increase in the importan ce of AOB with respect to the Water 2014 , 6 1916 
 
 starting structure. On the ot her hand, ciprofloxacin at c oncentrations of up to 350 ng L−1 removes the 
AOB domination of the system, in favor of Comamonas  strains. With time, AOB tend to grow in 
importance; however, the microbial community structure has still shifted completely, and the recovery 
of the system is impossible (Figure 3).

 4. Future Trends for the Pa rtial Nitritation Process  
The application of partial nitritation systems to nitrogen removal from wastewater is becoming 
more and more popular around the world. Today, full-scale plants that implement the partial 
nitritation/anammox system for nitrogen elimination fr om reject wastewater are a reality [3,76]. In 
addition, the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite is a necessary step for anammox bacteria (Table 2) to 
carry out autotrophic denitrification [3]. Therefore, the development of systems that rely on the 
anammox elimination of nitrogen will need to take into account partial nitritation processes. 
A promising technology based on anammox micr oorganisms is the CANON process. In these 
systems, partial nitritation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation medi ated by anammox bacteria take 
place in the same bioreactor. A coupled partial nitr itation-anammox reaction is possible due to the 
syntrophic metabolism of AOB and anammox bacteria and its spatial organizati on in granular biomass 
(Figure 4) [78]. Therefore, the necessity for two different bioreactors for partial nitritation and the 
elimination of nitrogen via the ana mmox pathway, as in the partial nitritation/anammox process, is 
removed. In spite of their engine ering advantages, CANON systems ar e more complicated in practical 
operation than partial nitritation bioreactors. Th e competition of NOB with AOB for oxygen and with 
anammox bacteria for nitrite is the major problem  for the performance of these systems [79]. The 
growth of NOB inside CANON bioreactors is comm only avoided by limiting the DO concentration in 
the system. The selection of AOB and the inactivation of NOB coupled  with the growth of anammox 
bacteria inside the same bioreactor  arises as the immediate future ap plication of part ial nitritation. 
Figure 4.  Fluorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH) image of a biomass granule from a 
CANON bioreactor. AOB (green) and anammox b acteria (red) are disp laced next to each 
other; the spatial organization of AOB and anammox bacteria inside the granule is 
determined by the syntrophic relationships among the phylotypes. 
 
On the other hand, the development of partial nitr itation systems has yet to solve the main problem 
that these processes have: the development of NOB communities inside the bioreactor. Many steps can 
be taken to further avoid the growth  of NOB species in partial nitritation reactors. One of these steps is 
Water 2014 , 6 1918 
 
 to turn partial nitritation processes into fully anaerobic processes. This can be done by taking into 
account the anaerobic nature of au totrophic ammonium oxidation [9]. 
Strains of N. eutropha  were reported to perform anaerobic ammonium oxidation with the mediation 
of nitrogen dioxide as an electron acceptor [80] . Further investigation showed that dinitrogen 
tetraoxide could also be utili zed as the final electron acceptor fo r anaerobic autotrophic ammonium 
oxidation in an N. eutropha  species [81]. Later, a new pathwa y for anaerobic autotrophic ammonium 
oxidation was proposed [81]. Here, dinitrogen tetr aoxide oxidizes ammonium to hydroxylamine and 
nitrous oxide with the mediation of the enzyme, AMO. In this way, for the purposes of anaerobic 
ammonium oxidation in N. eutropha , the presence of oxygen just causes nitrous oxide to become 
oxidized to nitrogen dioxide [82] . Furthermore, the study of the ni trogen cycle in oxygen-depleted 
marine areas suggests that anaerobic ammonium oxid ation is linked to Mn, Fe  and S reduction [83–86]. 
If AOB can perform anaerobic ammonium oxidation, th en partial nitritation r eactors could avoid the 
growth of NOB communities by setting up anaerobi c conditions in the system. Further work on 
technologies relying on this  pathway aims to change the future perspectives of autotrophic nitrogen 
removal processes.
