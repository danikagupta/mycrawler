Introduction
Pollution of drinking waters by dyes or other colorizing
substances is a serious problem because many of themexhibit toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic properties or maybe transformed into compounds possessing such properties[1, 2]. These substances leak into the water reservoirs natu-rally (e.g. humus compounds) or from inadequately puri-fied post-industrial wastes. Humus substances naturallypolluting fresh waters include mainly humic and fulvicacids, and their concentration in Miocene groundwatersmay exceed 100 mg ml
-1[3-5]. Also, the toxic and biodegra-
dation-resistant products of the paper industry may increasethe pollution of water. These products include lignin and its
derivatives: alkaline lignin, thiolignin and lignosulphonates[6]. The pharmaceutical industry also contributes to the gen-
eral pollution; it releases to the environment post-productionwastes rich in anthraquinonic antibiotics, e.g. daunomycin –a cytostatic drug revealing high affinity to nucleic acids [7].
Traditional methods of colored substance removal from
drinking waters and wastewaters are generally based onchemical decolorization (chlorination), but this does not effec-tively solve the problem of wastewater utilization. The ligninderivatives remain in the chlorinated waters in altered forms:as highly toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic chlorolignins,chlorophenols, chloroguaiacols and dioxins [2]. Chlorination
of humic substance-containing waters also results in theformation of toxic, carcinogenic trihalomethans e.g. chloro-form and haloacetic acids, acetonitriles, chloropicrin and Polish J. of Environ. Stud. Vol. 17, No. 6 (2008), 903-909

Abstract
An anamorphic Bjerkandera adusta R59 strain, isolated from soil, was found to decolorize post-indus-
trial lignin alkaline fraction, humic acids isolated from two kinds of soil and from brown coal. The drop ofmethoxyphenolic compound levels in liquid B. adusta cultures containing lignin or humic acids was correlat-
ed with decolorization of studied biopolymers, which suggests their partial biodegradation. It was shown thatthis process was coupled with the induction of secondary metabolism (idiophase), and highest peroxidaseactivity in culture medium and appearance of aerial mycelium. Decolorization of lignin and humic acids fromlessive soil and brown coal depended on glucose presence (cometabolism). Decolorization of humic acid fromchernozem was related partially to adsorption by fungal mycelium.

a main mutagenic factor in chlorinated water [3, 5].
Biological methods of water purification, especially
those based on biosorption and microbial biodegradation,are postulated to be safer than the chemical ones, mainlybecause the toxicity of  by-products of biological methodsis minimized [8]. Moreover, these methods are attractivefor their low costs, environmental safety and common soci-ety acceptance [1]. 
The alternative methods proposed for decolorization of
polluted drinking water are based on the use of white-rotfungi, synthesizing exogenous oxidoreductases: oxygen-dependent laccase and H
2O2-dependent peroxidases. These
enzymes catalyze the oxidative depolymerization of lignin
in lignocellulose wood complex [9] but also of other aro-matic compounds possessing a lignin-like structure. Amongwhite-rot basidiomycete the Panerochaete chrysosporium
strain revealed the greatest effectiveness at decolorizationand biodegradation of  lignosulphonates, Kraft lignin andhumic acids. Practical application of this strain in decol-orization of Kraft lignin-rich post-production wastewaterswas also reported [6, 8].
Decolorization and biodegradation abilities of different
Bjerkandera sp. including B. adusta strains were widely
studied [10, 11, 12]. A new strain of this fungus ( B. adusta
R59), isolated from soil was recently described [13]. B.
adusta R59 strain is the imperfect (anamorphic) stadium of
the fungus, similar to Geotrichum (mitosporic fungi). This
feature distinguishes B. adusta R59 from already reported
and described [11, 14] perfect B. adusta strains
(Basidiomycetes). This strain performed the decolorizationof diluted but also non-diluted (after the fungus adaptation)daunomycin-containing post-production effluent due to itspartial biodegradation [13]. 
This work presents the results of our pilot laboratory
experiments concerning the decolorization of lignin andhumic acids by the B. adusta R59 strain.
Materials and Methods
Fungal Strain
Anamorphic (mitosporic fungi) B. adusta R59 strain,
was isolated from the black earth soil (Pheozems, FAOclassification) from a field near Lublin (southeasternPoland). Isolation procedure and identification of the R59strain was described elsewhere [13]. Nucleotide sequences(rRNA gene fragment) of the fungus are available inGeneBank under the accession number AY 319191(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The strain has been deposit-
ed in the CCBAS culture collection under the accession  num-ber CCBAS930 (http://www.biomed.cas.cz//ccbas/fungi.htm).
Source of Lignin and Humic Acids
Lignin (LG), precipitated from first alkaline fraction
(from wood extract) by acidification with H2SO4, was
obtained from InterCell S.A. (Ostrołęka, Poland). Beforeuse, the lignin was dissolved in sterile 0.1 M NaOH and
adjusted to pH 7.0 with 0.2 M HCl. The lignin contained(g/kg of dry weight): 408.2 of carbon, 40.4 of hydrogen, 0.2of nitrogen; no ashes.
Humic acids (HAs) were obtained from brown coal
(Fluka, Switzerland) or isolated from chernozem andlessive soil according to Schnitzer and Schuppli [15].
Conditions  of B. Adusta R59 Growth
Pilot experiments of lignin and humic acids decoloriza-
tion were performed on Petri dishes ( ø=9 cm) with Park and
Robinson agar medium [16] with 0,25% glucose and 0.2%
lignin, 0.03% appropriate humic acid. The plates were inoc-
ulated by round pieces ( ø=1 cm) of R59 strain mycelium
after 7 days of growth on potato-glucose (20% potato, 2%
glucose) agar medium. Abilities of B. adusta strain to decol-
orize LG, HAs were estimated on a base of the extent ofdecolorization spheres (% of a total medium surface) [17].
Decolorization of lignin and humic acids was tested
also in liquid cultures under stationary conditions. 100 mlErlenmeyer flasks were filled with 50 ml of either mineralmedium for ligninolytic fungi [18] enriched with 0.2%lignin or Park and Robinson [16] medium containing0.01% humic acids. In each case, the media were supple-mented with 0.25% glucose. All versions of media wereinoculated with 1 ml of homogenized B. adusta R59
mycelium (10
5cfu ml-1) from a 7-day-old culture of fungus
on potato-glucose liquid medium. Non-inoculated mediaserved as controls. Cultures and controls were incubated at26ºC up to 60 days. The experiment was made in triplicate.
Analytical Methods
In liquid B. adusta R59 cultures enriched with LG,
HAs, the following parameters were estimated: • decolorization rate: for LG at 430 nm (maximum
absorbance), for HAs at 400 nm [19]
• peroxidase activity according to Maehly and Chance
[20] method with o-dianisidine as a substrate (previousoptimization showed that o-dianisidine was the best
substrate for B. adusta R59 peroxidase)
• methoxyphenolic compounds concentration was deter-
mined at 500 nm (for vanillic acid detection) accordingto Malarczyk [21]
• amount of HAs absorbed by fungal mycelium accord-
ing to Dari [22]. HAs absorbed by mycelium were elut-ed with 0.2M NaOH for 24h at room temperature andestimated at 400 nm at the same pH and volume para-meters as at the beginning of the experiment
• pH of medium• All assays were performed in triplicate.
Observations of Cultures
During culturing, the macroscopic and microscopic obser-
vations of mycelium growth and development were per-formed. Type of growth, sporulation, ratio of visible decol-orization of medium and color of mycelium were estimated.904 Korniłłowicz-Kowalska T., et al.Evaluation of Results
Results were analyzed by the statistical method count-
ing the standard deviations. Correlation coefficients (r)between decolorization degree and phenolics level in liquidculture media were estimated. 
Results and Discussion
Decolorization of Lignin and Humic Acids 
on Agarized and in Liquid Media 
by B. Adusta R59
Pilot experiments on decolorization of tested toxic sub-
stances by B. adusta R59 were performed on agarized
medium. Decolorization of 0.2% LG on Petri dishes withagarized medium began on the 5
thday of the experiment,
while total decolorization (correlated with the total over-growth of plates by R59 mycelium) was observed after 18days of B. adusta growth (Table 1). In an analogous exper-
iment with 0.03% humic acids, the decolorization also last-ed up to 18 days, with a rate dependent on HAs source. Thebeginning of the process (in the case of HAs from lessivesoil and brown coal) was observed on the 3
rdday of R59
growth. Total decolorization of medium and simultaneoustotal overgrowth of plates by R59 mycelium were found onthe 14
thor 18thday of B. adusta growth, respectively (Table
1). The results confirm our previously presented data [17]concerning the partial decolorization of HAs.
Our results confirmed the data obtained by other
researchers. Moreira et al., [14] reported that Bjerkandera
adusta is highly effective at decolorization of lignin-rich
post-production effluent in stationary cultures. Gramss etal. [23] showed that this fungus decolorized brown solu-tions of humic acids. 
Removal of LG and HAs from liquid cultures proceed-
ed much slower than in the case of solid media. Visibledecolorization of 0.2% alkaline LG was the slowest, withthe beginning at the 17
thday of culturing, and completed
after 25 days of R59 strain growth, with a correlation with33% decrease of medium absorbance in comparison withits initial value. The final effect of alkaline lignin decol-orization after 60 days of culture corresponded to a 50%reduction of absorbance (Fig. 1A), leaving the post-culturemedium slightly yellowish.The decolorizing properties of B. adusta R59 strain in
the case of lignin fractions are relatively weak when com-pared with Phanerochaete chrysosporium which is able to
decolorize 0.09% alkaline lignin solutions (black liquor) in60% during just 7 days [24]. This result, however, wasobtained using P . chrysosporium mycelium immobilized on
porous plastic rings. In our research we also found that R59mycelium in solid cultures decolorized lignin more effec-tively (65% during 10 days; Table 1) than in liquid cultures(Fig. 1A). In natural conditions, ligninolytic fungi areadapted to decompose the lignin in solid form (wood frag-ments, soil); this may explain higher lignin-decaying effec-tiveness of ligninolytic fungi on solid than in liquid media.Decolorization of Humic Acids and Alkaline... 905

Fig. 1. Decolorization of: 0.2% lignin (A); 0.01% humic acids
(B) by B. adusta R59 strain.In the case of 0.01% humic acids in liquid media, the
beginning of decolorization appeared on the 7thday of R59
growth. The decolorization of media containing HAs fromchernozem, brown coal and lessive soil corresponded to 60,38 and 17% loss of their initial absorbance, respectively(Fig. 1B). Thereafter, decolorization of the media augment-ed steadily and after 60 days it finally reached the values of90.5% and 74% for HAs from lessive soil and brown coal,respectively (Fig. 1B). These values are comparable withHAs decolorization results reported by Gramss et al. [23],who described the 41-73% decolorization of these com-pounds (initial concentration: 0.08%) within 3 weeks bywhite-rot fungi. However, it seems that decolorization of0.03% humic acids by R59 strain proceeds more effective-ly when performed on agarized media than in the liquidones (Table 1).
In the case of 0.01% HAs from chernozem, total visible
decolorization (data not shown) was observed on the 7
thday
of R59 growth (data not shown). This phenomenon wasaccompanied by 60% absorbance decrease (Fig. 1B) andpartial HAs absorption by mycelium. However, the amountof absorbed HAs was relatively low and even after 30 daysof the experiment did not exceed 6% of total HAs (Table 2).This phenomenon did not appear in the case of HAs fromlessive soil and brown coal. Similar results were reported inthe case of Rhizopus arrhizus (Zygomycota) cultures,
where it was postulated that microbial cell wall (especiallyits chitin components) played a crucial role in the processof humic acid absorption [25]. However, in the case of B.
adusta R59 strain, weak absorption (~5.5% of total HA)
does not seem to be of great significance. These results con-firm the reports of other authors. Poiting and Vrijmoed [26]showed that the amount of azo dyes and triphenylmethanedyes absorbed by Phanerochaete chrysosporium mycelium
did not exceed 3%. Other authors [27] reported that theamount of colorizing substances absorbed by fungalmycelium may reach even 40%, but only in cases of shak-en liquid cultures.
Growth of B. Adusta R59 Strain and pH Changes
in Cultures with LG and HAs 
Decolorization of LG and HAs from lessive soil and
brown coal in liquid media depended on the formation ofaerial mycelium (Table 3). In these media, the total over-growth of medium surface by sporulating aerial myceliumobserved after 20 days (in case of LG) or 30 days (HAs
from lessive soil and brown coal) of fungal growth was cor-related with visible medium decolorization. Moreover,media with HAs from lessive soil and brown coal and alsowith LG were acidified by 1-1.5 units (to pH 5.05-5.3),while in media supplemented with dyes, the pH droppedquickly to 3.0-3.5 and then increased to 5.0-6.0 (Table 3).

the 18thday of R59 growth  simultaneously with the begin-
ning of aerial mycelium formation (Table 3); afterwards,enzyme activity dropped to half of its maximum activity(on 25
thday) simultaneously with the moment of total visi-
ble decolorization of the medium (Fig. 2A, Fig. 1A). In caseof the media containing HAs, the highest peroxidase activ-ity was found in versions with HAs isolated from browncoal (13.27 mU ml
-1at 21stday of culture). Maximum
activities of peroxidase in media containing HAs fromlessive soil and from chernozem were lower (11.95 and 7.7 mU ml
-1, respectively) and appeared later (at 32ndand
28thday of culture, respectively). At the end of the experi-
ment, the enzyme activities dropped to values less than10% of its maximum value (Fig. 2B), which was correlatedwith almost total decolorization of the  medium (Fig. 1B).Therefore, we generally concluded that extracellular perox-idase activity is important for decolorization of lignin andhumic acids tested in our work. Numerous authors, such asGramss et al. [23] and Moreira et al. [14], postulated thecrucial role of peroxidase in decolorization and biodegra-dation of lignin and humic acids. Peroxidase activity wasalso found in cultures B. adusta R59 grown in the presence
of humic acids, lignocellulose [17] and daunomycin [13].Activity of laccase, other model ligninolytic enzyme ofwhite-rot fungi system, was not detected in B. adusta R59
cultures containing lignin (data not shown). However , in
our previous study, laccase was detected exclusively incultures enriched with humic acids extracted from browncoal [17]. Such a low laccase activity with simultaneoushigh activities of peroxidase was already reported in thecase of Kraft lignin [14] decolorization by B. adusta .
Moreira et al. [14], on the basis of results of fungal screen-ing, postulated  that active lignin decolorization may beperformed only by fungi exhibiting low laccase but highperoxidase activity.
Phenolics (methoxyphenolics groups) level in media
containing LG and HAs decreased steadily since the 3
rd
day of B. adusta growth, with the exception of HA from
lessive soil, where this process started on the 14thday of
culture (Fig. 3A, B). Degradation of these substances wasmore effective in media containing LG (50% of initial
amount) than HAs (15–25% of initial amount) (Fig. 3A, B).Methoxyphenolics amounts dropped at the end of theexperiment (60 days) to ~25% of their initial value formedium with LG and to ~60-70% of their initial values forversions with HAs. Decolorization of Humic Acids and Alkaline... 907

lation of these groups) in tested media containing lignin andhumic acids from brown coal, lessive soil and chernozemwas highly correlated with decolorization level (r = 0.880,0.977, 0.956 and 0.900, respectively, with α=0.001), sug-gesting that these compounds were biodegraded. Similarresults were obtained in B. adusta R59 cultures enriched
with daunomycin [13]. Demethylation of methoxyphenolicgroups in lignin is, according to Leonowicz [9], a peroxi-dase-catalyzed starting point of lignin biodegradation inwhite-rot fungi cultures.
In our earlier research [13] we showed that biodegrada-
tion of daunomycin by B. adusta R59 strain appeared in
idiophase (secondary metabolism). Similar observationswere found for the substrates studied in this article.Maximum peroxidase activity was observed in the culturessimultaneously with LG and HAs decolorization and withaerial mycelium formation by R59 strain. The trophophase-idiophase shift of fungal metabolism, manifested by theappearance of aerial mycelium, is equal to the shift to a sec-ondary metabolism phase. Lignin biodegradation by ananamorphic form of B. adusta R59 is therefore a process
dependent on fungal secondary metabolism. This statementis in agreement with current knowledge concerning thelignin metabolism of white-rot fungi.
Lignin cannot be degraded and serve as a sole carbon
and energy source for fungi; ligninolysis occurs only whenother readily biodegradable substrates are available [28].Participation of microbial extracellular peroxidase in thehumic acid decolorization process and the necessity of glu-cose presence in the culture medium were already reported[22]. We came to similar conclusions on the basis of resultsobserved for B. adusta R59 strain, presented in this work.
In medium without glucose (data not shown), the decol-orization of tested substances was inhibited and the fungusdid not produce aerial mycelium, which suggests repressionof secondary metabolism pathways. The fact that decol-orization of lignin and humic acids was observed only inthe presence of glucose postulates that this process per-formed by B. adusta R59 cultures is cometabolic in its char-
acter. 
Conclusions
Results obtained in our experiments lead to a conclu-
sion that an anamorphic B. adusta R59 is a promising
strain for decolorization of a broad spectrum of pollutedfreshwaters and wastewaters. This fungus decolorizeslignin effluent and humic acids with different effective-ness, but in all cases a total visible decolorization of inoc-ulated medium was finally observed. Therefore, the R59strain may be recommended for bioremedation of pollutedwaters, although its properties should be optimized (bymutagenization methods)  in order to increase its decol-orizing effectiveness. Such treatment may result in short-ened time of bioremediation performed by this fungus.Modification of B. adusta R59 strain will be a subject of
our further research.Acknowledgements
