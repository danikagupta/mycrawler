 Abstract 
 
Ferrous iron mediated autotrophic denitrification is an innovative bioprocess for nitrate 
removal, simultaneously with iron oxidation in wastewaters. Chemoautotrophic denitrifi ers convert 
nitrate to nitrogen gas and Fe(II) oxidation results in the production of ferric ir on precipitates that can 
be subsequently removed and recovered. Both mixed enrichments and pure cultures isolated fr om 
various habitats have been reported to perform nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation, especially  at 
circumneutral pH. Under these conditions, Fe(II) is not stable and a chelating agent, com monly 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), needs to be employed in order to prom ote a higher Fe(II) 
solubilization. Different biogenic Fe(III) (hydro)oxide mineral phases can be form ed, depending to 
many factors such as microorganisms, medium composition and incubation conditions. 
The feasibility of maintaining Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification with a Thiobacillus  
mixed culture, an activated sludge inoculum and pure cultures of Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 and 
T. denitrificans  under different pH and EDTA:Fe(II) conditions was initially investigated in batch 
bioassays. Lower EDTA: Fe(II) ratios resulted in higher nitrate removal eff iciency and rates. After a 
longer acclimation to Fe(II) and stimulation with S 2O32-, the Thiobacillus  mixed culture resulted in the 
highest specific nitrate removal rate, equal to 10.5 mg/(g VSS·d).  
Subsequently, the Thiobacillus  mixed culture was seeded in two identical up-flow packed bed 
reactors (PBRs) in order to optimize the operating parameters such as the hy draulic retention time 
(HRT) and the nitrate loading rate and evaluate their influence on nitrate removal and Fe(II)  oxidation 
during 153 d of operation. The HRT was shortened from 31 to 20 h. During the steady st ate the 
maximum nitrate volumetric loading rate (VLR) and volumetric removal rat e (VRR) were 280 and 
240 mg NO 3-/(L·d) for PBR1 and 210 and 160 mg NO 3-/(L·d) for PBR2, respectively. Results showed 
that the nitrate removal rate increased at increasing feed nitrate concen trations. At the steady state, 
nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation were 86±2% and 95.5±2.5%, respectively, in PBR1, w hereas 
65.5±3.5% and 70.0±2%, in PBR2. The lower initial feed NO 3- concentration resulted in lower 
efficiencies in PBR2.  
Moreover, the influence of heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn) was assessed in batch bioassays. T he 
highest nitrate removal efficiency and rates were achieved with the Thiobacillus -dominated mixed 
culture, whereas Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 was the least effective. At initial 20.0 - 40.0 mg 
Me/L, Cu showed to be the most inhibitory metal for mixed cultures, resulting in an inhibition in the 
range 33-66%. A lower impact was observed when Zn was supplemented, leading to a 17-41 % 
inhibition of nitrate removal. Ni showed the lowest inhibitory effect, with ni trate removal that wa s 
affected by 5-34% at Ni concentrations from 20.0 to 40.0 mg Ni/L. A higher sens itivity to metal 
toxicity was observed for the pure cultures. 
Finally, the mineral characterization of the precipitates obtained in the experi ments with Cu, Ni 
and Zn was investigated by different methods, i.e. scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Four ier 
transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescenc e (XRF). All 
samples contained ferrihydrite. In abiotic controls, the chemical Fe(II) oxida tion resulted in hematite 
formation and goethite or akaganeite. Precipitates of the experiments carried out w ith the 
Thiobacillus -dominated mixed culture were a mixture of hematite and akaganeite. When 
T.denitrificans  was used, hematite and maghemite were observed. The use of pure culture of 
Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 resulted in hematite and maghemite formation and the activated 
sludge enrichment allowed the production of hematite and maghemite and/or magnetite. No difference 
in the mineralogy of the precipitates was observed with the addition of Cu, where as the addition of Ni 
and Zn markedly stimulated the formation of maghemite. Heavy metals in the preci pitates were 
identified by chemical analysis, indicating co-precipitation and/or absorption in Fe(II I) (hydr)oxides.

 Sommario 
La denitrificazione autotrofa mediata da ferro ferroso è un processo innovativo pe r la rimozione 
dei nitrati, con la simultanea ossidazione del ferro, in acque reflue. I denitrif icatori chemoautotrofi 
convertono il nitrato ad azoto gassoso e l ’ossidazione del Fe(II) produce precipitati di ferro ferrico che 
possono essere successivamente rimossi e recuperati. Sia le colture arricchite mi ste che quelle pure, 
isolate da vari habitat, sono state indicate in grado di eseguire l ’ossidazione del Fe(II) nitrato-
dipendente, specialmente a pH vicino alla neutralità. In queste condizioni, il Fe(II) non è stabile e 
richiede l ’utilizzo di un agente chelante, come l ’acido etilendiamminotetraacetico (EDTA), affinchè si 
possa raggiungere una più elevata solubizzazione del Fe(II). Possono formarsi diverse fasi m inerali 
biogeniche di (idr-)ossido di Fe(III), a seconda di molti fattori come microorg anismi, composizione 
del mezzo e condizioni di incubazione. 
In questo studio è stata investigata la fattibilità di mantenere la denitrificaz ione autotrofa 
mediata da Fe(II) utilizzando una coltura mista di Thiobacillus, fango attivo come i noculo e una 
coltura pura del ceppo 2002 di Pseudogulbenkiania e T. denitrificans , in batch a differenti condizioni 
di pH e rapporto EDTA:Fe(II). 
Successivamente, la coltura mista di Thiobacillus  è stata inoculata in due reattori a letto 
impaccato (PBR) così da ottimizzare parametri operativi come il tempo di rit enzione idraulico (HRT) 
e il carico di nitrato, ed in questo modo valutare la loro influenza sulla ri mozione di nitrato e 
l’ossidazione del Fe(II) durante i 153 giorni di operatività. L ’HRT è stato accorciato da 31 a 20 ore. 
Durante la fase stazionaria, il massimo carico organico volumetrico (VLR) e il massimo tasso di 
rimozione volumetrico (VRR) di nitrato, erano 280 e 240 mg NO 3-/(L·d) per il PBR1 e 210 e 160 mg 
NO 3-/(L·d) per il PBR2, rispettivamente. I risultati hanno mostrato un tasso di rimo zione del nitrato 
crescente all ’aumentare della concentrazione di nitrato in entrata. Allo stato stazionario, la rimozione 
dei nitrati e l'ossidazione di Fe (II) erano 86 ± 2% e 95,5 ± 2,5%, rispettivamente, nel PBR1, mentre 
65,5 ± 3,5% e 70,0 ± 2%, nel PBR2. La minore concentrazione iniziale di NO 3- ha portato a minori 
efficienze nel PBR2. 
Inoltre, è stata valutata l'influenza di metalli pesanti (Ni, Cu e Zn) att raverso uno studio in 
condizioni batch. La più alta efficienza e il maggiore tasso di rimozione del nitrato sono stati ottenuti 
utilizzando la coltura mista dominata da Thiobacillus , mentre il ceppo 2002 di Pseudogulbenkiania  è 
stato il meno efficace. A valori iniziali di 20.0-40.0 mg Me/L, Cu ha dimostrato di essere il metallo 
più inibitore per le colture miste, con conseguente inibizione nell ’ordine di 33-66%. Un impatto 
inferiore è stato osservato con Zn, che ha portato ad un'inibizione del 17-41% della r imozione di 
nitrati. Ni ha mostrato il più basso effetto inibitorio, con la rimozione del ni trato che è stata 
influenzata del 5-34% alle concentrazioni di Ni da 20.0 a 40.0 mg Ni/L. Le colture pure hanno 
mostrato una maggiore sensibilità alla tossicità del metallo. 
Infine, la caratterizzazione minerale dei precipitati ottenuti negli esperim enti con Cu, Ni e Zn è 
stata analizzata mediante diversi metodi: microscopia elettronica a scansione (SEM), sp ettroscopia 
infrarossa a trasformazione di Fourier (FTIR), spettroscopia Raman e fluorescenza a ragg i X (XRF). 
Tutti i campioni contenevano ferridrite. Nei controlli abiotici l'ossidazio ne chimica di Fe(II) ha 
provocato la formazione di ematite e goethite o akaganeite. I precipitati degli esperimenti condot ti con 
la coltura mista dominata dal Thiobacillus  erano una miscela di ematite e akaganeite. Quando è stato 
utilizzato T.denitrificans , sono state osservate ematite e maghemite. L'uso della coltura pura del ceppo 
2002 di Pseudogulbenkiania  ha portato alla formazione di ematite e maghemite e l'arricchimento dei 
fanghi attivi ha permesso la produzione di ematite e maghemite e/o magnetite. N on è stata osservata 
alcuna differenza nella mineralogia dei precipitati aggiungendo Cu, mentre l'aggiunt a di Ni e Zn ha 
notevolmente stimolato la formazione di maghemite. I metalli pesanti nei precipi tati sono stati 
identificati mediante analisi chimiche, indicando co-precipitazione e/o assorbim ento in (idr-)ossidi di 
Fe (III).

 Résumé 
La dénitrification autotrophe utilisant le fer Ferreux est un bioprocédé innovant pour  
l'élimination des nitrates tout en permettant en même temps l'oxydation du fer dans l es eaux usées. 
Les bactéries dénitrifiantes chimio-autotrophes convertissent les nitrates en azote gazeux et 
l'oxydation du Fe(II) conduit à la production de précipités de fer ferrique qui peuvent ensuit e être 
éliminés et récupérés.  
La possibilité de maintenir une dénitrification autotrophe avec le fer ferreux en util isant une 
culture mixte de Thiobacillus , un inoculum de boue activée et des cultures pures de 
Pseudogulbenkiania  2002 et de T. denitrificans  dans différentes conditions de pH et d'EDTA:Fe(II) a 
été initialement étudiée dans des essais en mode batch. Des ratios plus faibles d’EDTA:Fe(II) se 
traduisent par une efficacité et des taux d'élimination des nitrates plus élevés. La culture mixte de 
Thiobacillus,  qui présente le taux d'élimination de nitrate le plus élevé, est égal à 1,18 mM·(g VSS· d)-
1. 
Par la suite, la culture mixte de Thiobacillus  a été ensemencée dans deux réacteurs à lit fixe à 
flux ascendant identiques. Les deux réacteurs (réacteur 1 et 2) ont reçu respectivement 120 et 60 mg 
L-1 de nitrate et une alimentation différente de Fe (II) afin de respecter un rapport molaire Fe(II):NO 3- 
de 5:1. L ’EDTA a été supplémenté à un rapport molaire EDTA:Fe(II) de 0,5:1. Le pH, le temps de 
séjour hydraulique (TSH) et la température étaient de 6,5-7,0, 31 h et 22 ± 2 ° C. Dans le réacteur 1, le 
TSH a été raccourci de 31 à 24 h et la concentration de NO 3- a été maintenue stable à 250 mg L-1. 
Inversement, le réacteur 2 a été mis en fonctionnement avec un TSH décroissant et une concen tration 
entrante de NO 3- permettant de maintenir un taux de charge de NO 3- stable. Après environ 80 jours 
d'incubation, l'élimination des nitrates était de 88% dans le réacteur 1 pour un TSH de 31 h. 
L'élimination de nitrates la plus élevée obtenue dans le réacteur 2 était de 80% . Une diminution du 
TSH de 31 à 24 h n'a pas affecté l'élimination des nitrates dans le réacteur 1, alors que dans le réacteur 
2 l'élimination du nitrate a diminué à 64%. 
De plus, l'influence des métaux lourds (Ni, Cu, Zn) sur la dénitrification aut otrophe utilisant 
du fer ferreux a été évaluée dans des essais biologiques discontinus, en utilisant les mêmes cultures 
microbiennes. L'efficacité et les taux d'élimination des nitrates les plus élevés ont été obtenus avec la 
culture mixte dominante de Thiobacillus , alors que la souche Pseudogulbenkiania  de 2002 était la 
moins efficace. Cu s'est avéré être le métal le plus inhibiteur pour les cultur es mixtes. Un impact plus 
faible a été observé lorsque le Zn a été ajouté. Le Ni présentait l'effet inh ibiteur le plus faible. Une 
sensibilité plus élevée à la toxicité des métaux a été observée pour les cultures pures.  
Enfin, la caractérisation minérale des précipités obtenus pour les expériences avec du Cu, Ni 
et Zn a été étudiée. Pour les témoins abiotiques, l'oxydation chimique du Fe (II) a ent raîné la 
formation d'hématite. Un mélange de différents (hydro)oxides de Fe(III) a été observ é pour toutes les 
cultures microbiennes, et en particulier : i) un mélange d'hématite, d'akaganéite et / ou de ferrihydrite 
a été observé dans les précipités des expériences réalisées avec la culture mixte dom inée par la 
présence de Thiobacillus ; ii) également l'hématite, l'akaganeite et / ou de la ferrihydrite, la m aghémite 
a été identifiée lorsque la culture pure de T. denitrificans  a été utilisée; iii) l'utilisation de la culture 
pure de la souche Pseudogulbenkiania  2002 a entraîné la formation d'hématite et de maghémite; enfin, 
l'enrichissement en boues activées a permis la production d'hématite et de magnétite en plus de la 
maghémite. Aucune différence concernant la minéralogie des précipités n'a été observée  avec 
l'addition de Cu, alors que l'addition de Ni et de Zn a probablement stimulé la format ion de 
maghémite. Une caractérisation minérale supplémentaire est cependant nécessaire.

 Samenvatting 
Ferro-ijzer gemedieerde autotrofe denitrificatie is een innovatieve bioproce s voor 
nitraatverwijdering, gelijktijdig met ijzeroxidatie in afvalwate r. Chemoautotrofe denitrificeerders 
zetten nitraat om naar stikstofgas en Fe(II) oxidatie resulteert in de productie van ferro-ijzer 
precipitaten die vervolgens kunnen worden verwijderd en teruggewonnen. Van zowel gemengde 
verrijkingen als zuivere culturen geïsoleerd uit verschillende habitats is gem eld dat ze 
nitraatafhankelijke Fe(II) oxidatie uitvoeren, vooral bij circumneutrale pH. Onder deze 
omstandigheden is Fe(II) niet stabiel en moet een cheleringsmiddel, gewoonlijk ethylee ndiaminetetra-
azijnzuur (EDTA), worden gebruikt om een hogere Fe(II) -solubilisatie te bevorderen . Verschillende 
biogene Fe(III) (hydro) oxide minerale fasen kunnen worden gevormd, afhankelijk van vele factoren 
zoals micro-organismen, gemiddelde samenstelling en incubatie-omstandigheden. 
De haalbaarheid van het onderhouden van Fe(II) -gemedieerde autotrofe denitrificatie met een 
Thiobacillus gemengde kweek, een actief slib inoculum en zuivere kweken van Pseudogulbenkiania  
stam 2002 en T. denitrificans  onder verschillende pH en EDTA:Fe(II) omstandigheden werd 
aanvankelijk onderzocht in batch bioassays . Lagere EDTA:Fe (II) -verhoudingen resu lteerden in een 
hogere efficiëntie en snelheden van nitraatverwijdering. Na een langere acclim atisering van Fe (II) en 
stimulatie met S 2O32-, resulteerde de gemengde cultuur van Thiobacillus  in de hoogste specifieke 
nitraatverwijderingssnelheid, gelijk aan 10.5 mg/(g VSS·d)-1. 
Vervolgens werd de gemengde kweek van Thiobacillus  geënt in twee identieke up-flow 
gepakte bedreactoren (PBR's) om de bedrijfsparameters zoals de hydraulische retentiet ijd (HRT) en 
de nitraatbeladingssnelheid te optimaliseren en hun invloed op nitraatverwijdering en Fe (II) te 
evalueren oxidatie gedurende 153 d bewerking. De HRT werd ingekort van 31 tot 20 uur. Tijdens de 
stationaire toestand waren de maximale nitraat-volumetrische belastingssnelheid (V LR) en 
volumetrische verwijderingssnelheid (VRR) 280 en 240 mg NO 3 -/(L·d) voor PBR1 en 210 en 160 mg 
NO 3-/(L·d) voor PBR2, respectievelijk. De resultaten toonden aan dat de nitraatver wijderingssnelheid 
toenam bij toenemende nitraatconcentraties. Bij de steady-state waren nitraatver wijdering en Fe(II) -
oxidatie respectievelijk 86 ± 2% en 95.5 ± 2.5%, in PBR1, terwijl 65.5 ± 3.5% en 70.0 ± 2%, in 
PBR2. De lagere initiële NO 3- concentratie aan voer resulteerde in lagere efficiënties in PBR2. 
Bovendien werd de invloed van zware metalen (Ni, Cu, Zn) beoordeeld in batch-bioassays. De 
hoogste nitraatverwijderingsefficiëntie en -snelheden werden bereikt met de door Thioba cillus 
gedomineerde gemengde kweek, terwijl Pseudogulbenkiania stam 2002 het minst effectief w as. 
Aanvankelijk 20.0 - 40.0 mg Me/L, bleek Cu het meest remmende metaal te zijn voor gem engde 
kweken, resulterend in een remming in het bereik van 33-66%. Een lagere impact werd wa argenomen 
wanneer Zn werd aangevuld, wat leidde tot een 17-41% remming van de verwijdering v an nitraat. Ni 
vertoonde het laagste remmende effect, waarbij nitraatverwijdering werd aangetast door 5-34% bij Ni-
concentraties van 20.0 tot 40.0 mg Ni/L. Een hogere gevoeligheid voor metaaltoxiciteit w erd 
waargenomen voor de zuivere culturen. 
Ten slotte werd de minerale karakterisering van de precipitaten verkregen in de experimenten 
met Cu, Ni en Zn onderzocht met verschillende methoden, dat wil zeggen scanning 
elektronenmicroscopie (SEM), Fourier transformatie infrarood spectroscopie (FTIR), Raman 
spectroscopie en X-stralen fluorescentie (XRF). Alle monsters bevatten ferri hydriet. Bij abiotische 
controles resulteerde de chemische Fe(II) -oxidatie in hematietvorming en goethiet of  akaganeiet. 
Precipitaten van de experimenten uitgevoerd met de door Thiobacillus  gedomineerde gemengde 
cultuur waren een mengsel van hematiet en akaganeiet. Wanneer T.denitrificans  werd gebruikt, 
werden hematiet en maghemiet waargenomen. Het gebruik van zuivere kweek van 
Pseudogulbenkiania  stam 2002 resulteerde in hematiet en maghemietvorming en de geactiveerde 
slikverrijking maakte de productie van hematiet en maghemiet en / of magnetiet mo gelijk. Er werd 
geen verschil in de mineralogie van de precipitaten waargenomen met de toevoeging van Cu, terwijl 
de toevoeging van Ni en Zn de vorming van maghemiet duidelijk stimuleerde. Zw are metalen in de 
precipitaten werden geïdentificeerd door chemische analyse, hetgeen co-precipitati e en/of absorptie in 
Fe (III) (hydro) oxiden aangeeft.   xvi

 1.1 Background and problem statement 
Clean water is essential for human health and environment, therefore water quality is 
one of the most important concerns of European environmental policy. One of the first 
European Union (EU) legislation was the 1991 Nitrate Directive aimed to control pollution of 
water resources. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient for organisms, but, however, is harmful to people 
and nature ecosystems at high concentrations (European Union, 2000). Nitrate is one of the 
most common pollutants in water resources worldwide (Park and Yoo, 2009; Zhang et al. , 
2015). The 2000 EU Directive on nitrate pollution reported that nitrate concentrations must 
not exceed the trigger value of 50 mg/L in drinking water (European Union, 2000). The main 
causes of nitrate contamination is the agricultural fertilizers and the uncontrolled discharge of 
industrial and domestic wastewaters (Viers et al., 2012; Qambrani et al., 2013; Zhang et al. , 
2015).  
The high costs of physicochemical methods for nitrate removal from wastewaters 
such as ion exchange, reverse osmosis, adsorption, and electrodialysis limit their applications 
(Shrimali et al., 2001). Biological denitrification is a cost-effective technology for removal of 
nitrate from wastewaters, with high efficiencies and low energy consumption (Zhang et al., 
2015; Zhou et al., 2016). Heterotrophic denitrification is the most used bioprocess for nitrate 
removal (Ashok and Hait, 2015). However, heterotrophic metabolism requires carbon source 
and many wastewaters contain no or too low carbon, while the addition of external organics 
can result in organic residues (Zhang et al., 2015). Nitrate can often be found in mining 
environments due to the extensive use of nitrate-containing explosives such as ‘ammonium 
nitrate fuel oil ’ (ANFO) (Zaitsev et al. , 2008). Mining wastewaters that are generated contain 
nitrate with several metals species, including iron (Papirio et al. , 2014).  
The crucial dependency on raw materials such as metals and its supply risk is a 
growing concern for EU in the recent years. EU has set up a long-term strategy to reduce 
landfilling and increase recycling and recovery of these materials from “urban mines ” and 
industrial waste to support the transition towards a circular economy (European Union, 
2017). Nowadays, the need of iron is significantly higher, due to the growth of human 
population. The natural high-grade ores are rapidly decreasing (Yan and Wang, 2014), 
therefore the exploration of secondary sources of iron is crucial.  
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification is an alternative biotechnology to 
simultaneously remove nitrate and recover iron through the formation of Fe(III) precipitates. 19 
 The first microorganisms capable of maintaining biological nitrate-dependent Fe(II) 
oxidation were discovered only 20 years ago (Straub et al., 1996). The use of denitrifying 
Fe(II) oxidizers results in the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas and the 
bioprecipitation/biorecovery of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, with the possible co-precipitation or 
adsorption of other metals (Hohmann et al., 2009; Ahoranta et al., 2016). Microorganisms 
capable of the process are neutrophilic, therefore ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is 
commonly employed as chelating agent in order to promote a higher Fe(II) solubilization, a s 
Fe(II) is not stable at circumneutral pH (Kiskira et al., 2017). 
So far, nitrate dependent Fe(II) oxidation has been reported in both mixed 
enrichments and pure cultures isolated from various habitats, however most of the studies 
have been focused in the microbiology rather than developing the process as a biotechnology 
for nitrate removal and iron recovery. Further research is therefore needed in order to 
evaluate the Fe(II)- mediated autotrophic denitrification in continuous-flow applications. 
 
1.2 Objectives and scope of the study 
This research investigated the Fe(II) mediated autotrophic denitrification in order to 
achieve nitrate removal with an emphasis on the bioprecipitation/biorecovery of iron and 
other heavy metals by different microbial cultures. The specific objectives of this research 
are: 
1. Investigation of the feasibility of maintaining denitrification with different EDTA:Fe(II) 
ratios, feed pH and microbial culture s within batch bioassays. 
2.  Investigation of the effect of other metals (Ni, Cu, Zn) on the process in batch bioassays. 
3. Mineral characterization of the Fe(III)(hydr)oxides during Fe(II)-driven denitrification. 
4. Evaluation of the process in packed bed reactors (PBRs) in order to evaluate the effect of 
different operating parameters (e.g. hydraulic retention time, feed nitrate concentration and 
nitrate loading rate) on the performance of Fe(II)-driven denitrification.

 1.3 Thesis outline  
This PhD thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter (Chapter 1) provides a 
brief overview of this research and the thesis as depicted in Figure 1.1.  
 
 
Figure 1 .1: Overview of the PhD thesis structure  
 
Chapter 2 reports a critical literature review about current knowledge on Fe(II)-
mediated autotrophic denitrification, the characteristics of the Fe(II)-oxidizing denitrifiers, 
the operating conditions adopted in the existing studies, the characteristics of the produced 
Fe(III) hydr(oxides) and the influence of other metals on the process. 
Chapter 3 describes the experimental results obtained investigating the efficiency of 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification in terms of Fe(II) oxidation and nitrate removal 
with different microbial cultures in batch bioassays, the effects of decreasing pH on the 
process and the investigation of the optimal EDTA/Fe(II) ratio. 
Chapter 4 discusses the results obtained investigating the efficiency and rates of 
nitrate removal during Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification in the presence of Ni, Cu 
and Zn in batch bioassays. Moreover, the investigation of how the different microbial 
cultures, tolerated the effect of Ni, Cu and Zn was assessed.  
21 
 Chapter 5 presents the mineral characterization of the Fe(III) (hydr)oxides by different 
methods, i.e. X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy 
equipped with energy dispersive X-Ray Analyser (SEM-EDX) and Fourier transformation 
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). 
In chapter 6, Fe(II) mediated autotrophic denitrification was studied in continuous-
flow experiments using two identical up-flow packed bed reactors, in order to optimize the 
operating parameters (e.g. HRT, feed nitrate concentration and nitrate loading rate) and 
evaluate their effects on the process.  
Chapter 7 highlights the major findings and the implications of the research and 
provides perspectives and recommendations for future works.

 2.1 Introduction 
Iron (Fe) is the most abundant element (on weight basis) on the planet, in both 
lithosphere and biosphere (Johnson et al., 2012). From ancient times, Fe has played an 
important role in the society and is associated with industrial development and improvement 
of living standards. Fe is a soft metal with good ductility and malleability and has a 
substantial strength to ductility ratio (Yan and Wang, 2014). The applications of iron in the 
daily life are many and Fe processing for industrial purposes accounts for 95% of worldwide 
metal production (Ilbert and Bonnefoy, 2013). 
However, iron is not only economically important but is also an essential 
micronutrient for most organisms, including humans. Fe is a component in many cellular 
compounds and is involved in numerous physiological functions. Iron is incorporated as a 
cofactor in many metalloproteins involved in vital metabolic pathways, including oxygen 
transport, DNA synthesis and electron transport (Kendall et al., 2012; Ilbert and Bonnefoy, 
2013). The iron deficiency often leads to anemia that can cause several motor and mental 
impairments in children, low work productivity in adults and poor pregnancy outcome 
(Horton and Ross, 2003). 
Iron production is primary or secondary. Primary production consists of iron 
extraction from natural ores, rocks and minerals. Worldwide both iron and steel industries are 
mostly reliant on Fe-based ores as primary sources of iron. In nature, iron is not usually found 
as free metal but in association with or covered by natural organic matter or in particles 
associated with phosphate (PO 43-) and arsenate (AsO 43-) (Kappler and Straub, 2005). 
Hematite (Fe 2O3) and magnetite (Fe 3O4) are the main iron-containing ores. Other common 
iron minerals are limonite (Fe 2O3·H2O), siderite (FeCO 3), pyrite (FeS 2) and ilmenite 
(FeO·TiO 2). Furthermore, Fe can be found in minerals that are mixed or co-precipitated with 
other minerals (e.g., clays) (Kappler and Straub, 2005). Up to date, the major world reserves 
of iron ores and the main iron producers are in Australia, Brazil, Russia, China, India and 
Canada. Other important producers are Ukraine, Sweden, United States, Iran, Kazakhstan and 
South Africa. Brazil and Australia export more than half of the iron extracted worldwide 
(Statista, 2016). 
Nowadays, due to the growth of human population, the need of iron for steel 
production is significantly higher. The natural high-grade ores are rapidly decreasing 
inducing the exploration of secondary sources of iron. Europe, United States, Japan and other  
 
26 
 developed countries are adopting technologies for recycling scraps to be used for steel 
production (Yan and Wang, 2014). Industrial wastewaters, generated from activities such as 
metal plating, metal picking, mining, fertilizer industries, tanneries, batteries, electronic and 
electroplating, paper mills and pesticides, can act as artificial ores, as they can contain iron 
concentrations as high as 100 g/L (Gonzalez-Munoz et al., 2006; Agrawal et al., 2009; Fu and 
Wang, 2011).  
Mining activity is the principal producer of acidic and heavy metal contaminated 
wastewaters. Rainwater passing through abandoned mines, waste materials (spoils) and 
reactive mineral wastes (tailings) results in acid mine drainage (AMD) caused by the 
oxidation of sulfide minerals (e.g. FeS 2) that release H+ ions, metals and sulfate into water 
(Johnson, 2003; Johnson and Hallberg, 2005). The most common metal present in mining 
waters and AMD is iron, with concentrations generally higher than 500 mg/L, and in some 
cases up to 35 g/L (Johnson, 2003). Depending on the characteristics of the ores, various 
other metals and metalloids can be present, such as Al, Mn, As, Ba, Cd, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, 
Co, Bi, Ga, In, Hg, Re, Sb, Sn, Te and Zn (Banks et al., 1997; Johnson, 2003) that can also 
affect iron precipitation and speciation. 
In general, the conventional methods for iron removal and recovery are 
physicochemical and electrochemical (Fig. 2.1). Physicochemical methods include chemical 
precipitation, oxidation and filtration, coagulation/flocculation, flotation, ion exchange, 
adsorption and membrane technology such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis (Gonzalez-
Munoz et al., 2006; Dobson and Burgess, 2007; Polat and Erdogan, 2007; Akpor and Muchie, 
2010; Barakat, 2011; Balaji et al., 2014). The electrochemical methods are electroextraction, 
electrodialysis, membrane electrolysis and electrochemical precipitation (Smara et al., 2005; 
Korzenowski et al., 2008; Ali et al., 2013; Tong et al., 2014). Despite the high 
removal/recovery efficiency, physicochemical and electrochemical methods are very 
expensive and not preferable, especially when metal concentrations are low (Schiewer and 
Volesky, 2000). Moreover, the high maintenance requirements and the instability of large 
volumes of sludge results in significant environmental concerns and a loss of valuable metals 
(Hoque and Philip, 2011; Jadhav and Hocheng, 2012) 
Nowadays, the industrial activity has to deal with more and more stringent effluent 
discharge regulations that usually result in high operating costs making the entire process 
unprofitable. Therefore, it is of major importance to investigate innovative technologies for 
recycling and recovery of iron from secondary sources such as AMD and industrial 27 
 wastewaters (Papirio et al., 2013). Besides the conventional physicochemical methods for 
iron removal and recovery, biotechnologies are more widely used nowadays for their low cost 
and energy requirement while giving recovery yields higher than 90% (Hoque and Philip, 
2011; Jadhav and Hocheng, 2012). Furthermore, biorecovery is a self-sustaining technology 
since the microbial population increases when the contaminant is present and decreases when 
the contaminant is limited (Akpor and Muchie, 2010). 
Nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation is a promising biotechnology to be employed for 
iron recovery when nitrogen and metal contamination coexist (Papirio et al., 2014a; Zou et 
al., 2015). Chemoautotrophic denitrifiers are capable of coupling Fe(II) oxidation to 
denitrification resulting in the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas and the production of 
Fe(III) precipitates that can be subsequently removed and recovered.This review article 
contains the current knowledge about Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification. Initially, a 
short summary of iron biogeochemistry and the environmental concerns of Fe(II) and nitrate 
are given. The attention is then focused on the characteristics of the Fe(II)-oxidizing 
denitrifiers, the operating conditions adopted in the existing studies, the characteristics of the 
produced Fe(III) hydr(oxides) and the influence of other metals on the process. Finally, the 
use of pyrite as an alternative electron donor is discussed.

 2.2 Biochemistry of iron  
Iron can exist in a range of oxidation states from –2 to +6, with Fe(II) and Fe(III) 
species being the most common ones (Ilbert and Bonnefoy, 2013). Fe oxidation state depends 
on many factors, such as pH, redox potential (Eh), temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and 
the presence or absence of other dissolved constituents such as complexing agents (Bird et 
al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2012; Kendall et al., 2012; Ilbert and Bonnefoy, 2013). Chemical 
and biological processes such as redox transformations, dissolution, precipitation, 
mobilization and redistribution rule iron biogeochemistry and occur in both terrestrial and 
aquatic environments (Kappler and Straub, 2005).  
Chemical Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III) precipitates formation are promoted at pH 
higher than 3 (Bird et al., 2011). At increasing pH and DO, Fe(II) oxidation rate increases 
(Kendall et al., 2012). Chemical Fe(II) oxidation can also occur under anaerobic conditions in 
presence of Mn(IV), NO 3-, NO 2- N 2O (Kappler and Straub, 2005). Iron cycle is also 
influenced by microorganisms that generate energy for growth by the oxidation or reduction 
of iron (Bird et al., 2011). Microbial Fe(II) oxidation can occur in aerobic and anaerobic 
environments, while Fe(III) reduction is only common in anaerobic habitats (Kappler and 
Straub, 2005). 
Fe(II) is more abundant in anaerobic environments and Fe(III) in aerobic, due to the 
rapid chemical oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) by molecular oxygen (Johnson et al., 2012). 
Despite its geologic abundance, iron is often a growth limiting factor at circumneutral pH due 
to the formation of iron oxides, which are highly insoluble and, thus, not readily available for 
uptake by the most of the microorganisms (Johnson et al., 2012). In order to maintain Fe in 
solution, chelators (e.g. siderophores) can be used to form Fe complexes leading to higher 
soluble Fe concentrations, even at circumneutral pH (Bird et al., 2011).  
The understanding of the iron cycle in aquatic environments is crucial as it influences 
the mobility, speciation and fate of organic and inorganic pollutants, including toxic trace 
metals and metalloids (Plach et al., 2014). The microbial iron cycle can be used in a variety 
of applications, such as the bioleaching of ores (Hedrich et al., 2011) and the bioremediation 
of mining waters contaminated with soluble Fe(II) (Johnson et al., 2012). The redox 
transformations of iron and precipitation and dissolution of iron minerals are the result of 
chemical and microbial processes (Fig. 2.2). 29

2.2.1 Fe(II) microbial oxidation 
The microorganisms capable of oxidizing Fe(II) can be divided into a) aerobic 
neutrophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing, b) aerobic acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing, c) anaerobic Fe(II)-
oxidizing phototrophic and d) anaerobic Fe(lI)-oxidizing nitrate-reducing bacteria (Kappler 
and Straub, 2005). All the bacteria of the first three groups belong to the Proteobacteria  
phylum. Ilbert and Bonnefoy (2013) characterized the last group as neutrophilic anaerobes 
dependent on nitrate, perchlorate or chlorate. 
Aerobic neutrophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms use oxygen as electron 
acceptor for enzymatic oxidation of Fe(II). Such bacteria are able to grow under microaerobic 
conditions and increase the half-life of Fe(II) up to 300 times (Emerson et al., 2010), making 
biological Fe(II) oxidation predominant over chemical. All the known aerobic neutrophilic 
iron oxidizers are mesophilic and belong to Betaproteobacteria  and Zetaproteobacteria  when 
isolated from freshwater or marine environments, respectively (Hedrich et al., 2011; Ilbert 
and Bonnefoy, 2013). 
 
 
30 
 Aerobic acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms are the most widespread among 
the Fe(II) oxidizers due to the chemical stability of Fe(II) at acidic pH (Ilbert and Bonnefo y, 
2013). They can use solar and chemical sources for energy, a variety of electron ac ceptors 
and organic and/or inorganic sources of carbon (Johnson et al., 2012).  
The anaerobic phototrophic bacteria grow by using light and Fe(II) as source of 
energy and electron donor, respectively. Several species have been discovered in freshwat er 
and marine environments (Hedrich et al., 2011). Fe(II) oxidation occurs in a very narrow pH 
range (between 6.5 and 7) (Kappler and Straub, 2005).  
Finally, the first microorganisms capable of oxidizing Fe(II) through dissimilatory 
reduction of nitrate were discovered about two decades ago (Hafenbradl et al., 1996; Straub 
et al., 1996). All the intermediates of the nitrate reduction pathway can be used as electron 
acceptors for Fe(II) oxidation as their redox pair potentials are more positive than that of the 
couple Fe(III)/Fe(II) at neutral pH. Moreover, this metabolism is more abundant than that by 
phototrophs as it does not require light (Kappler and Straub, 2005). 
To date, the capability to use Fe(II) for energy acquisition has been reported to be 
widespread among the prokaryotes. Aerobic and anaerobic oxidizers at neutral pH need to 
deal with the limited availability of dissolved Fe(II) (Konhauser et al., 2011; Ilbert and 
Bonnefoy, 2013). Moreover, the redox potential of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple presents an 
extreme variability that is dependent on pH and the presence of complexing agents (Ilbert and 
Bonnefoy, 2013). 
 
2.2.2 Fe(III) reduction 
Biological Fe(III) reduction rates depend on the solubility of Fe(III) from mineral 
dissolution and the affinity with the chelating agents (Bird et al., 2011). Fe(III) is abundant in 
many environments resulting in a significant variety of Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms 
which are normally divided into acidophiles and neutrophiles. 
Both microbial groups can use reduced sulfur compounds and hydrogen or 
fermentation products such as simple fatty acids and ethanol as inorganic and organic 
electron donors, respectively, for Fe(III) reduction (Kappler and Straub, 2005; Johnson et al., 
2012). At pH<3, the end product of Fe(II) oxidation by extreme acidophiles is often soluble 
Fe(III), that can be subsequently used as electron acceptor for Fe(III) reduction by sev eral 
acidophilic microorganisms (Hedrich et al., 2011). However, up to now the mechanisms of 
acidophilic bacteria and archaea catalyzing Fe(III) reduction are still poorly understood 31 
 (Johnson et al., 2012). At neutral pH, Fe(III) can be a dominant electron acceptor, although 
its low solubility (Kappler and Straub, 2005; Konhauser et al., 2011) inducing some 
microorganisms to develop mechanisms to transfer electrons from the cell to the surface of 
the Fe(III) compounds (Weber at al., 2006a). The preferred sources of solid-phase Fe(III) are 
amorphous or poorly-ordered iron oxyhydroxides such as ferrihydrite and goethite (Weber et 
al., 2006a). Nevertheless, microbial Fe(III) reduction has been observed also with Fe(III) 
oxides with a higher crystallinity (i.e. hematite and magnetite) and Fe-rich clays (e.g. 
smectite) (Weber et al., 2006a; Konhauser et al., 2011; Kendall et al., 2012). 
 
2.2.3 Formation of Fe minerals 
In aquatic environments, Fe minerals can be abiotically and/or biotically produced, 
with the two typologies of process often occurring simultaneously. Differences in the 
crystalline structure of the non-biogenic and biogenic minerals have been reported, although 
the morphology of the crystals is often very similar and requires further advanced 
mineralogical examination (Chan et al., 2011). 
The biological formation of minerals is known as biomineralization and can occur 
through two main different mechanisms (Konhauser and Riding, 2012). The first mechanism 
is the “biologically controlled mineralization ”, which is independent from the external 
conditions and mostly controlled by the organisms (Konhauser, 1997; Gadd, 2010). The 
second mechanism is the ‘biologically induced mineralization ’ that intimately occurs 
depending on the external environmental conditions (Konhauser, 1997; Gadd, 2010).  
The most common iron (oxyhydro)oxides on the Earth ’s surface are ferrihydrite, 
goethite, lepidocrocite, hematite, maghemite, magnetite and green rusts. Under aerobic 
circumneutral conditions, iron exists as amorphous oxyhydroxides and crystalline oxides 
(Plach et al., 2014). Three general morphologies are known; the cuboidal, parallelepipedal 
and arrowhead or tooth-shaped crystals. The formed mineral size ranges between 35 and 120 
nm (Konhauser, 1997).  
Oxidation of dissolved Fe(II) leads to the formation of Fe(III) minerals and the 
precipitation of various Fe(III) phases. Initially, dissolved Fe(II) species such as [FeOH]2+ 
and [Fe 2(OH 2)]4+ are formed during abiotic oxidation. Subsequently, Fe(II) species are 
transformed into polymeric Fe(III) colloids prior to precipitating as poorly crystalline 
ferrihydrite particles (2-5 nm as diameter) (Kappler and Straub, 2005). In most cases, 
ferrihydrite (Fe 5HO 8·4H 2O), often written as Fe(OH) 3 or FeOOH, is unstable and tends to be  
 
32 
 transformed into more stable iron oxides (crystalline FeOx forms) such as goethite and 
hematite, depending on the solution composition, temperature and pH (Konhauser, 1997; 
Dousova et al., 2005; Plach et al., 2014). Ferrihydrite transformation can be either driven by a 
“solid-state conversion ” which is an internal rearrangement of iron and oxygen atoms leading 
to hematite (Fe 2O3) formation or by a “dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism ” that results in 
the production of goethite [FeO(OH)] (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). 
 
2.3 Environmental concerns  
2.3.1 Iron release and detrimental effects  
The maximum acceptable concentration of Fe(II) in drinking water is 0.2 mg/L 
recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The limit of Fe(II) into wastewater 
varies between 2-5 mg/L for European countries. In water resources, excess iron leads to a 
reddish color and a distinctive unpleasant smell (Cho, 2015). As a metal, Fe is a non-
biodegradable element that can accumulate in the food chain and be adsorbed by living 
organisms including humans, resulting in serious health disorders, such as depression, rapid 
and shallow respiration, coma, convulsions, respiratory failure and cardiac arrest according to 
WHO. Moreover, the presence of iron-utilizing bacteria in Fe(II)-containing water sources 
can result in infestations of water distribution systems (HDR Engineering Inc., 2002). 
Elevated amounts of Fe(II) are contained in several industrial wastewaters such as 
mining waters and AMD. A mine producing AMD has the potential for long-term devastating 
impacts on lakes, rivers, streams and aquatic life according to Environmental Law Alliance 
Worldwide (ELAW). Metal precipitates, particularly iron, coat the stream bottom with an 
orange-red colored slime giving the water the name of “yellow boy ”. The worldwide 
environmental pollution due to AMD is difficult to evaluate precisely. In 2002, about 240,000 
km2 of Earth's surface were reported to be affected by mining pollution (Furrer et al., 2002). 
Johnson and Hallberg (2005) estimated that ca. 19,300 km of streams and rivers, and ca. 
72,000 ha of lakes and reservoirs worldwide had been seriously damaged by mine effluents. 
In Canada, there are an estimated 351 million tons of waste rock, 510 million tons of sulfide 
tailings, and more than 55 million tons of other mining sources which have the potential to 
cause AMD. Several authors discussed the AMD contamination in the Iberian Pyrite Belt 
(IPB), one of the largest massive sulfide deposits in the world that is widely known for the 
intensive mining activity (Sarmiento et al., 2012; Grande et al., 2014). Gold mining also 33 
 contributes to iron pollution as gold is intimately associated with sulfide minerals such as 
pyrite (FeS 2) or arsenopyrite (FeAsS).  
 
2.3.2 Nitrate pollution in the hydrosphere 
Nitrate is one of the most common pollutants in water (Bosman, 2009). The 
regulation of nitrate concentration in drinking water is 50 mg/L for European countries, much 
higher than in USA where the limit is 10 mg/L. Large amounts of nitrate into water resources 
have significant ecological and human health effects. For instance, nitrate metabolically 
reacts with amines and amides and forms nitrosamines, which are known carcinogens 
(Bosman, 2009). Another international issue associated with nitrate uncontrolled discharge is 
eutrophication (Camargo et al., 2005).  
Nitrogenous compounds are not usually in the list of the ‘chemical concerns ’ 
associated with mining (Bosman, 2009). However, nitrate and ammonium are the most 
common nitrogen species released to the aquatic environment from mining operations 
(Zaitsev et al., 2008). This is mainly due to the use of extensive amounts of explosives such 
as ‘ammonium nitrate fuel oil ’ (ANFO) or leaching solutions to elute elements such as 
copper, nickel, gold and uranium (Koren et al., 2000; Zaistev et al., 2008; Hayrynen et al., 
2009).  
Nitrate is stable and highly soluble with low potential for co-precipitation or 
adsorption (Luk and Au-Yeung, 2002). Various technologies are available for nitrate 
treatment, such as ion exchange, adsorption, chemical treatment, and membrane technology 
(Park and Yoo, 2009). Biologically, denitrification for nitrate removal is a well-established 
technology which is feasible even under low pH and temperature conditions and in presence 
of toxic metals (Papirio et al., 2014b). 
 
2.4 Fe(II) iron-mediated autotrophic denitrification  
Recently, biotechnologies have been largely used for the recovery of metals and 
involve the development of technologies based on the understanding of living organisms 
(Fig. 2.3). Fe(II) iron-mediated autotrophic denitrification is a new bioprocess for 
removal/recovery of iron and reduction of nitrate from wastewaters. Anaerobic nitrate-
dependent Fe(II) oxidation has most likely evolved in the primordial deep sea water that was 
rich in NO 3− due to the N 2 conversion during lightning discharge on the early Earth (Ilbert  
 
34 
 and Bonnefoy, 2013). Despite this, biological nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation was only 
discovered 20 years ago by Straub et al. (1996). This process is based on the bio-oxidation of 
Fe(II) to Fe(III), followed by the bioprecipitation of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides with possible co-
precipitation or adsorption of other metals. Electrons are transferred to nitrate that is 
anaerobically reduced to nitrogen gas through denitrification (Devlin et al., 2000). Complete 
nitrate reduction to N 2 without accumulation of intermediates has been reported in most 
studies (Straub et al., 1996; Chaudhuri et al., 2001 ; Weber et al., 2006b ; Blothe and Roden, 
2009). However, depending on the microbial culture used, a significant production of nitrite 
and nitrous oxide has been observed (Li et al., 2014). 
Recently, Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification is gaining scientific interest over 
classical heterotrophic denitrification especially for the treatment of industrial wastewaters. 
Such waters are usually poor of carbon and the supplementation of organics in order to 
stimulate heterotrophic denitrification would result in secondary organic pollution and 
additional treatment and operating costs (Zhang et al., 2015). Moreover, autotrophic 
microorganisms consume larger quantities of energy-generating substances for the reduction 
of CO 2, inducing lower biomass production and potential for biofouling in comparison with 
heterotrophic denitrifiers (Devlin et al., 2000). However, autotrophic bacteria growth is 
generally slower because of the incomplete Krebs cycle that generates less ATP (Mattes et 
al., 2013). 
Besides Fe(II), autotrophic denitrifiers can use other inorganic electron donors, such 
as zero-valent iron (Biswas and Bose, 2005), pyrite (FeS 2) (Bosch et al., 2012), hydrogen gas 
H2 (Chen et al., 2014), reduced sulfur compounds (Zou et al., 2016) and As(III) (Senn and 
Hemond, 2002) assimilating dissolved CO 2 (or HCO 3-) as source of carbon for microbial cell 
synthesis (Straub et al., 1996). Results showed that the performance of Fe(II)-mediated 
autotrophic denitrification is fairly higher than denitrification with other electron donors such 
as sulfur and hydrogen (Park and Yoo, 2009; Zhang et al., 2015). Also, in presence of metals 
such as Cu(II) and Ag(I), Fe(II)-driven denitrification is catalyzed resulting in higher nitrate  
removal rates and the possibility of recovering iron and other metals (Hansen et al., 1996). 
The complete reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas is as suggested by Sorensen (1987): 
 
10 Fe2+
(aq) + 2 NO 3-
(aq) + 24 H 2O → N 2(g) + 10 Fe(OH) 3(s) + 18 H+
(aq)     (Eq. 2.1) 
 35 
 The mechanisms used by the neutrophilic nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidizers are, 
however, not well defined yet. An energetic benefit from this metabolism for the organisms 
involved is achieved at circumneutral and alkaline pH (Muehe et al., 2009; Weber et al., 
2009). Under these conditions, the redox potential of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple (+200 mV) is 
lower than the NO 3-/NO 2- couple (+430 mV) in standard conditions promoting the reaction 
between Fe(II) and NO 3-. In contrast, the redox potential of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple is much 
higher (+770 mV) and the reaction is inhibited at acidic pH (Hedrich et al., 2011).  
 
 
2.4.1 Fe(II)- oxidizing denitrifiers 
Nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidizers are widespread among the prokaryotes and 
responsible for dissimilatory Fe(II) metabolism (Ilbert and Bonnefoy, 2013). There are even 
evidences that Escherichia coli , a well-known anaerobic bacterium, is capable of Fe(II) 
oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction (Brons et al., 1991; Carlson et al., 2012; Carlson et al., 
2013). Although Fe(II) is used as main electron donor, most of the microbial species capable 
of this metabolism do not grow under strict lithotrophic conditions but require an additional 
electron donor or organic carbon as energy source (Straub et al., 2004). Nitrate-dependent 
Fe(II) oxidation has been observed with both mixed enrichments and pure cultures. Tables 
2.1 and 2.2 report the prokaryotes capable of maintaining nitrate dependent Fe(II) oxidation 
under mixotrophic and strictly autotrophic conditions, respectively. 
Microorganisms have been isolated from various habitats, such as freshwater and 
saline environments, paddy soils, ponds, streams, ditches, brackish lagoons, lake sediments, 
wetlands, aquifers, hydrothermal and deep-sea sediments (Weber et al., 2006a; Hedrich et al., 
2011). The various microorganisms mostly belong to archaeal and eubacterial genera of the 
phylum Proteobacteria  (classes α-, ȕ-, Ȗ- and į-) (Hedrich et al., 2011). The majority of the 
studies has been performed under mesophilic conditions (30-40°C) or at room temperature, as 
most of the microorganisms capable for the process are mesophilic. However, both 
psychrophilic and thermophilic organisms are known, as the bacterium Thermomonas strain 
BrG3, that grows in the range 4-37°C (Mergaert et al., 2003), and the hyperthermophilic 
archaeum Ferroglobus placidus  that has an optimal growth at 85°C (Hafendradl et al., 1996).

2.4.1.1 Mixed cultures 
The ability to oxidize Fe(II) with nitrate is widespread amongst the Proteobacteria  
and may also be found among the Gram-positive bacteria with high guanine-cytosine (GC) 
content of DNA (Straub et al., 2004). Nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation has been reported by 
enrichment cultures mostly collected from freshwater and brackish water sediments. Most 
cultures are mixotrophic and need an organic carbon source in order to oxidize Fe(II) and 
reduce nitrate (Straub et al., 1996; Benz et al., 1998). Only few cultures are capable of a strict 
autotrophic metabolism such as freshwater enrichment KS (Straub et al., 1996) and an 
enrichment culture from marine sediment (Benz et al., 1998). The capability of maintaining 
Fe(II)-driven denitrification by the autotrophic freshwater enrichment culture KS has been 
thoroughly demonstrated (Buchholz-Cleven et al., 1997; Schaedler et al., 2009; Weber et al., 
2001; Blothe and Roden, 2009; Hohmann et al., 2009; Shelobolina et al., 2012). Furthermore, 
the culture was shown to be capable of nitrate-dependent oxidation of Fe(II) solid-phases 
37 
 such as biotite (Weber et al., 2001) and Fe(II)-rich trioctahedral mica in granitic rocks 
(Shelobolina et al., 2012). 
Fe(II)-driven autotrophic denitrification by traditional activated sludge was observed 
by Nielsen and Nielsen (1998) for the first time in wastewater treatment plants aimed at 
biological phosphorus removal. In presence of autotrophic denitrifiers, Fe(II) 
supplementation results in Fe(II) oxidation to Fe(III) that promotes chemical phosphorus 
removal and enhances sludge flocculation properties. A heterotrophic denitrifying enriched 
culture from a lab-scale high-rate denitrifying reactor was able to perform nitrate -dependent 
anaerobic Fe(II) oxidation (Wang et al., 2014). The same culture was used for the 
bioaugmentation of ongoing high efficiency nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation reactors 
(Wang et al., 2015).  
Mixed cultures are generally preferred in environments contaminated by several 
substances, such as other metals, arsenic, uranium and hydrocarbons. Anaerobic oxidation of 
Fe(II) dependent on nitrate has been observed in toluene-degrading incubations, petroleum-
contaminated aquifer sediments and sludge from oil water separators (Caldwell et al., 1999). 
Hydrocarbon and Fe(II) oxidation simultaneously occurred with nitrate as electron acceptor. 
Fe(II) oxidation was enhanced when organic electron donors were provided (Caldwell et al., 
1999). The supplementation of nitrate in aquifer sediments contaminated with uranium 
stimulated Fe(II) and U(IV) oxidation (Finneran et al., 2002). Anaerobic As(III) and Fe(II) 
oxidation can be simultaneously performed with autotrophic denitrification with lake (Senn 
and Hemond, 2002) and activated sludge communities (Sun et al., 2009a). The use of 
microorganisms belonging to the genus Azoarcus  and the family Comamonadaceae  resulted 
in the removal of As(V) through immobilization of As(V) onto Fe(III) (hydr)oxides (Sun et 
al., 2009a).  
In mixed cultures, chemolithotrophic Fe(II)-oxidizing denitrifiers are usually present 
in a lower amount than other species, not however affecting the ability of oxidizing Fe(II) 
(Straub and Buchholz-Cleven, 1998). The enumeration and detection of nitrate-dependent 
Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria in different freshwater sediments showed that the number of 
mixotrophic nitrate-reducing iron oxidizers is two order of magnitude lower than that of the 
heterotrophic (acetate)-oxidizing denitrifiers (Muehe et al., 2009). Quantifications by most 
probable number showed the presence of 1 104 autotrophic and 1 107 heterotrophic nitrate-
dependent Fe(II) oxidizers per gram of fresh sediment in a group of uncultured 
Actinobacteria  (Kanaparthi et al., 2013).

The activity of chemolithotrophic Fe(II) oxidizing denitrifiers can be reduced by the presenc e 
of phototrophic microorganisms using Fe(II) as electron donor in freshwater lake ecosystems. 
Phototrophs have been shown to oxidize Fe(II) more quickly and potentially outcompete 
autotrophic denitrifiers under optimal light conditions. A diel cycle is needed in order to 
promote chemolithotrophic Fe(II)-mediated denitrification (Melton et al., 2012). 
 
2.4.1.2 Autotrophic and mixotrophic growth in pure cultures  
Several pure cultures of Fe(II) oxidizers have been isolated and tested for Fe(II)-
mediated denitrification under both mixotrophic and strict autotrophic conditions. Most of 
these microorganisms have only been used in a few studies and are here briefly described. 
The most studied bacteria are instead reported in the following subsections and analyzed in 
detail. The strain ToN1, intimately close to Thauera selenatis , as well as P. stutzeri  and the 
strain SZF15, belonging to the Pseudomonas  genus, have been demonstrated to be capable of 
denitrifying by using Fe(II) as sole electron donor (Straub et al., 1996; Muehe et al., 2009; Su 
et al., 2015). Paracoccus denitrificans and ferrooxidans strains are facultative autotrophs and 
can perform Fe(II) oxidation with uncomplexed Fe(II) and [Fe(II)EDTA]2- (Kumaraswamy et 
al., 2006; Muehe et al., 2009). A novel anaerobic autotrophic nitrate-dependent Fe(II) 
oxidizer, the strain Citrobacter freundii  PXL1, was isolated from an anoxic sludge of a 
wastewater treatment plant and reported to have the potential of synchronous removal of 
nitrate, Fe(II) and arsenite (Li et al., 2014; 2015). 
Gallionella ferruginea  is also related with autotrophic nitrate-dependent Fe(II) 
oxidation as reported in the studies of Gouy et al. (1984) and Hallbeck et al. (1993). 16S 
rRNA gene libraries from the enrichment culture KS were dominated by a phylotype related 
to Sideroxydans lithotrophicus  and Gallionella ferruginea  by 95 and 94%, respectively 
(Blothe and Roden, 2009). Organisms related to Gallionella  and Sideroxydans  species were 
labeled in the autotrophic nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing culture TM3 group of uncultured 
Actinobacteria  (Kanaparthi et al., 2013). 
Fe(II)-oxidizing denitrifiers have also been found in extreme environments. The 
neutrophilic archaeum Ferroglobus placidus  was isolated from a shallow submarine 
hydrothermal system, growing between 65 and 95°C (Hafenbradl et al., 1996). Under 
psychrophilic conditions (3 to 10°C), chemolithotrophic nitrate dependent iron-oxidizing 
bacteria were observed on the seafloor near an active hydrothermal field and capable of 
oxidizing different Fe(II) sources (FeS, FeCO 3, FeCl 2 and FeS 2) (Edwards et al., 2003).  
42 
 Many cultures are instead reported to require a source of organic carbon as an 
additional electron donor. The strain HidR2, isolated from brackish-water sediments, and the 
strains LP-1 and AR-1, originally observed in an activated sludge, are able to anaerobicall y 
oxidize Fe(II) only in presence of 0.2-1.1 mM of acetate (Straub et al., 1996; Benz et al. 
1998). LP-1 was tentatively classified within the family of Pseudomonadaceae  (Gallus and 
Schink, 1994). Other cultures require larger amount of organic carbon (>1.5 mM) for 
mixotrophic growth, such as the strain FW33AN (99% 16S rDNA sequence identity with 
Klebsiella oxytoca ) that was isolated from an U(VI)- and NO 3- contaminated groundwater 
(Senko et al., 2005a, 2005b). In agreement, the ability of Klebsiella  species for nitrate 
reduction was also reported in experiments with the bacterium K. pneumoniae L17 with 
glucose and Fe(II) as electron donors (Liu et al., 2014) . The strain Desulfitobacterium 
frappieri  G2 requires acetate and Fe(II) in equivalent amount to oxidize soluble and structural 
Fe(II) and reduce nitrate (Shelobolina et al., 2003). No growth in the absence of either Fe(II) 
or acetate is observed. A pure culture of Geobacter metallireducens  is able to oxidize both 
Fe(II) and U(IV) in presence of acetate with nitrate as electron acceptor (Finneran et al., 
2002). 
 
Pure cultures isolated from the freshwater enrichment KS 
Three strains BrG1, BrG2 and BrG3 were isolated from the strictly lithotrophic 
culture KS and shown to be responsible for Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification 
(Straub et al., 1996). Only BrG2 is capable of autotrophically oxidizing Fe(II), while BrG1 
and BrG3 cometabolize Fe(II) with 0.5-1 mM of acetate as an additional electron donor and 
carbon source (Straub et al., 1996; Straub and Buchholz-Cleven, 1998). BrG1 and BrG2 
strains belong to ȕ-Proteobacteria (Buchholz-Cleven et al., 1997). The BrG3 strain was 
affiliated with the Xanthomonas  group of the Ȗ-Proteobacteria . Straub et al. (2004) also 
reported that strains BrG1, BrG2 and BrG3 are affiliated with the genera Acidovorax , 
Aquabacterium , and Thermomonas , respectively. This has also been confirmed by Mergaert 
et al. (2003) who isolated a new species, named Thermomonas fusca , belonging to the genus 
Thermomonas , with a 99.6% similarity to the strain BrG3. Acidovorax  strain BrG1 can be 
abundant in iron sulfide mineral and nitrate-rich groundwater ecosystems (Haaijer et al., 
2012).  
  
43 
 Thiobacillus denitrificans 
Thiobacillus denitrificans is a well-known bacterium that was first isolated by 
Beijerinck in 1904. T. denitrificans  can be found in soil, mud, freshwater, marine sediments 
and also in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater treatment ponds, especially under 
anoxic conditions. T. denitrificans  grows as an anaerobic chemolithotroph on thiosulfate, 
tetrathionate, thiocyanate, sulfide or elemental sulfur by using nitrate, nitrite or nitrous oxide 
as terminal respiratory oxidants (Kelly and Wood, 2000; Zou et al., 2016). Nonetheless, also 
Fe(II) has been observed to promote T. denitrificans  growth under strictly autrotrophic 
conditions (Straub et al., 1996). Supplementation of Fe(II) as FeS or FeS 2 is preferable as 
sulfur acts as energy source. Beller et al. (2006) reported the complete genome sequence of T. 
denitrificans strain ATCC 25259  and its capability for nitrate-dependent oxidation of Fe(II) 
added as siderite (FeCO 3). On the contrary, T. denitrificans  has been reported to be unable to 
oxidize Fe(II) in the form of FeSO 4 (Muehe et al., 2009). 
In contrast with the previous studies, Kanaparthi and Conrad (2015) found that a pure 
culture of T. denitrificans  was incapable to maintain chemolithotrophic nitrate-dependent 
Fe(II) oxidation without the presence of humic substances. Humic substances significantly 
enhanced the bacterial growth and activity, probably due to the chelation of iron, while 
addition of other chelating agents such EDTA inhibited the growth of T. denitrificans  
(Kanaparthi and Conrad 2015). 
 
 Pseudogulbenkiania ferrooxidans sp. strain 2002 
Pseudogulbenkiania ferrooxidans  strain 2002 (formerly known as Lutiella 
nitroferrum ) was isolated from a freshwater lake sediment (Weber et al., 2006b) and 
commonly found as dominating species in paddy soils used for the cultivation of rice and 
soybean (Tago et al., 2011). This novel strain of nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidizing 
microorganisms belongs to the family of Neisseriaceae  in the ȕ-class of Proteobacteria  
(Weber et al., 2006b, 2009; Byrne-Bailey et al., 2012). P. ferrooxidans  is an anaerobic 
(nitrate-dependent), mesophilic, neutrophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing lithotroph which does not need 
addition of organic substrate. Soluble Fe(II) is used as sole electron donor with nitrate 
reduced to gaseous end products (N 2 or N 2O) by a strict lithotrophic metabolism. P. 
ferrooxidans  is also capable of oxidizing Fe(II) in the clay mineral nontronite (NAu-2) (Zhao 
et al., 2013, 2015). 
  
44 
 Species of the genus Acidovorax   
The genus Acidovorax  is associated with nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation, as four 
Acidovorax  species within the class of ȕ-Proteobacteria  are capable of performing Fe(II)-
driven denitrification. The strains are known as BrG1, BoFeN1, 2AN and Ebreus  strain 
TPSY. 
The Acidovorax  strain BoFeN1 was isolated from a freshwater lake sediment 
(Kappler et al., 2005) and can only grow mixotrophically with acetate concentrations ranging 
between 0.3 and 5 mM (Kappler et al., 2005; Muehe et al., 2009; Pantke et al., 2012; 
Klueglein and Kappler, 2013; Miot et al., 2014). The Acidovorax  strain BoFeN1 is capable to 
oxidize Fe(II) in soluble and mineral forms (i.e. vivianite) (Larese-Casanova et al., 2010; 
Miot et al., 2009a). In comparison with other pure cultures, i.e. P. stutzeri  and P. 
denitrificans , Rhodobacter ferroxidans  strain SW2 and the mixed culture KS, Acidovorax  sp. 
strain BoFeN1 results in higher Fe(II) oxidation rates (Muehe et al., 2009; Hohmann et al., 
2009).  
The Acidovorax  strain 2AN was enriched from a mixture of iron-oxide-bearing 
sediments (Chakraborty et al., 2011). This species is able to oxidize aqueous non-complexed 
Fe(II), chelated Fe(II) (i.e. Fe(II)-EDTA), and solid-phase Fe(II) coupled to nitrate reduction 
at circumneutral pH, in presence of acetate (Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013a).  
The nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidizing strain TPSY was isolated from groundwater as 
a facultative anaerobe, capable of mixotrophic growth on Fe(II) and nitrate with acetate (Zhu 
et al., 2013; Carlson et al., 2013). This strain has been renamed Acidovorax ebreus  and is 
closely related to Diaphorobacter nitroreducens (Byrne-Bailey et al., 2010), capable of 
oxidizing Fe(II)-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid), Fe(II)-NTA-agarose and synthetic vivianite in 
presence of acetate (Carlson et al., 2013). 
 
Perchlorate-reducing bacteria  
Several studies reported the ability of perchlorate-reducing bacteria for nitrate-
dependent Fe(II)-oxidation (Weber et al., 2006c; Coby et al., 2011; Chakraborty and Picardal, 
2013a;b). The dominating bacteria detected in freshwater sediments responsible for the 
process are all ȕ -Proteobacteria Dechloromonas  species (Weber et al., 2006c; Coby et al., 
2011). The Dechloromonas strain UWNR4 is able to oxidize both soluble Fe(II) and chelated 
Fe(II)-EDTA with acetate (Coby et al., 2011; Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013a;b). The 
Dechlorosoma suilium strain PS has also been shown to perform Fe(II)-mediated  
45 
 denitrification under mixotrophic conditions (Chaudhuri et al, 2001; Lack et al., 2002a). D. 
suillum  strain PS has 99% similarity to the endophyte Azospira oryzae  strain N1 found in 
several species of rice (Reinhold-Hurek and Hurek, 2000; Byrne-Bailey and Coates, 2012) 
and in rice paddy soils (Ratering and Schnell, 2001; Tago, 2011).  
 
Anammox bacteria 
Anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacteria are capable of maintaining 
nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation. Investigations on iron and manganese respiration by 
Candidatus Kuenina stuttgartiensis  indicated that iron was oxidized with nitrate as electron 
acceptor (Strous et al., 2006). Also enrichment cultures of Candidatus Brocadia sinica  and 
Candidatus Scalindua sp.  anaerobically oxidize Fe(II) while reducing NO 3- to nitrogen gas 
(Oshiki et al., 2013). Moreover, the supplementation of Fe(II) has been observed to be 
stimulatory for anammox bacteria enhancing the specific growth rates that are generally 
rather low (Liu and Ni, 2015). 
 
2.4.2 Operating parameters affecting Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification 
The studies that investigated Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification can be 
divided into those focusing on 1) nitrate removal and 2) iron biorecovery with 
characterization of Fe(III) precipitates. Most of the studies have been performed with in batch 
systems, whereas only a few works evaluated the potential of continuous-flow reactors (Sun 
et al, 2009b; Chakraborty et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015) and were 
recently reviewed (Di Capua et al., 2015). In the following sections, the impacts of the 
operating parameters on Fe(II)-driven denitrification are illustrated.  
 
2.4.2.1 pH 
  pH is a very important parameter affecting both microbial activity and iron speciation. 
At very acidic pH, Fe(II) is stable but biological activity of most denitrifying cultures is 
repressed. On the other hand, at circumneutral pH the denitrifying biological activity is 
favored but Fe(II) is more rapidly oxidized. Most of the studies were performed with a feed 
pH ranging between 6.0 and 8.0, as none of the known Fe(II)-oxidizing denitrifiers has been 
reported to be acidophilic. However, the TM3 group of uncultured Actinobacteria  was found 
to be capable of performing the process at pH 4.5 (Kanaparthi et al., 2013).   
46 
 As Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification produces acidity, a feed pH higher than 
7.0 is generally recommended in order to strengthen the process (Zhang et al., 2015). An 
investigation of the optimal pH showed that nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation occurred with 
the highest rates and efficiency at pH between 6.4 and 6.7 (Straub et al., 2004). In continuous 
flow experiments, nitrate removal was higher than 95% as long as the effluent pH was higher 
than 6.0 (Zhang et al., 2015). Oshiki et al. (2013) reported a wider optimal pH range 
(between 5.9 and 9.8) and did not observe Fe(II) oxidation and NO 3- reduction at pH below 
5.0. Larese-Casanova et al. (2010) tested three different pH values (6.3, 7.0, 7.7) and 
observed significant differences in Fe(III) mineralogy although the small pH range. At pH 
6.3, only lepidocrocite was observed, whereas an increasing amount of goethite was detected 
at higher pH. 
 
2.4.2.2 Temperature 
Most of the studies on Fe(II)-driven autotrophic denitrification was carried out under 
mesophilic conditions as temperatures in the range 28-40°C are optimal for the growth of 
Fe(II)-oxidizing denitrifiers (Straub et al., 1996; Oshiki et al., 2013). Microcosms prepared 
under psychrophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic conditions in the range of 4-75°C 
resulted in lower microbial activities and denitrification rates (Oshiki et al., 2013). 
 
2.4.2.3 Fe(II)/NO 3- ratio 
A molar Fe(II)/NO 3- ratio of 5 has been observed as the most effective to achieve a 
complete and faster nitrate removal with different microbial cultures and operating conditions 
(Straub et al., 1996; Blothe and Roden, 2009; Chaudhuri et al., 2001; Weber et al., 2006b). At 
Fe(II)/NO 3- ratios lower than 4.0, a significant production of intermediates such as nitrite and 
nitrous oxide has been observed (Li et al., 2014). On the contrary, Fe(II)/NO 3- ratios higher 
that 7.5 result in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and, thus, remaining nitrogen 
pollution (Li et al., 2014). When formed during denitrification, nitrite can chemically react 
with Fe(II) (Shelobolina et al., 2003; Kumaraswamy et al., 2006; Larese-Casanova et al., 
2010; Klueglein and Kappler, 2013; Zhao et al., 2013) resulting in the production of Fe(III) 
and reduced nitrogen compounds including NO, N 2O, and N 2 (Shelobolina et al, 2003; 
Kumaraswamy et al., 2006). Chemical oxidation of Fe(II) with nitrite occurs only when 
nitrite concentration is higher than 1 mM (Straub et al., 1996), and results in lower oxidation  
47 
 rates than microbial Fe(II) oxidation (Kappler al., 2005). Depending on the microbial culture, 
a lower Fe(II)/NO 3- ratio than 5 can be used. Oshiki et al, (2013) observed that two pure 
anammox enrichment cultures Candidatus Brocadia sinica  and Candidatus Scalindua 
required 2.8 and 3.3 moles of Fe(II) to reduce 1 mol of NO 3-, respectively. 
 
2.4.2.4 Fe(II) and NO 3- feed concentrations and sources 
The average Fe(II) and NO 3- concentrations used in most studies are in the ranges 2.0-
10.0 and 0.1-6.0 mM, respectively. However, higher feed Fe(II) concentrations have been 
tested. Feed Fe(II) and NO 3- as high as 25 and 10 mM, respectively, did not inhibit the 
growth of Dechlorosoma suillum  (Lack et al., 2002a). Similarly, the activity of  Candidatus 
Brocadia sinica  and Candidatus Scalindua  was not affected in presence of 15 mM of Fe(II) 
(Oshiki et al., 2013). 
Higher concentrations of NO 3- have also been tested, without any inhibitory effect 
(Liu et al., 2014). Concentrations between 5.8-8.0 mM of NO 3- and 1.0-5.0 mM of Fe(II) 
resulted in 30-45% of nitrate removal and 85-100% of Fe(II) oxidation in 3 to 6 d by a pure 
culture of Citrobacter freundii strain PXL1.  
Fe(II) has been mostly supplemented as FeCl 2, FeSO 4, FeCO 3, FeS and 
Fe(NH 4)2(SO 4) (Caldwell et al., 1999; Hafenbradl et al., 1996; Straub et al., 1996; Weber et 
al., 2006b). Minerals such vivianite (Fe(II) 3(PO 4)2·8H 2O), nontronite 
(Na0.3Fe2((Si,Al) 4O10)(OH) 2 ·nH 2O), and biotite K(Fe) 3(AlSi 3O10)(F,OH) 2 have also been 
used as sources of Fe(II) (Miot et al., 2009a; Shelobolina et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2013). 
Some microorganisms prefer Fe(II) in the form of sulfate, sulfite or sulfide, as sulfur cannot 
be excluded as further source for microbial growth (see 4.1.2.2). Nevertheless, a significant 
influence of the Fe(II) source on the autotrophic denitrification extent has not been observed, 
but further studies are needed in order to assess the different mineralogy of Fe(III) 
precipitates.  
 
2.4.2.5 Chelating agents 
Chelating agents, such as EDTA and NTA have been used in several studies 
(Shelobolina et al., 2003; Kumaraswamy et al., 2006; Chakraborty et al., 2011; Carlson et al., 
2013; Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013a; 2013b; Kanaparthi et al., 2013; Kanaparthi and 
Conrad, 2015; Kluglein et al., 2015). Fe-EDTA optimizes the process as the abiotic reactions  
48 
 are minimized (Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013a) and prevents Fe(III) hydroxide mineral 
formation allowing the activity of microbes (Shelobolina et al., 2003; Chakraborty et al., 
2011). 
A complete Fe(II) oxidation was observed in 14 h by adding NTA and using 
Desulfitobacterium frappieri strain G2 as microbial culture (Shelobolina et al., 2003). 
However, in another experience the addition of EDTA resulted in a slower Fe(II) oxidation (5 
d) than that obtained with aqueous Fe(II) (3 d) by Dechloromonas  sp. UWNR4 (Chakraborty 
and Picardal, 2013b). Microbial activity is significantly influenced by the molar EDTA/Fe(II) 
ratio as microbial cultures differently deal with the toxic effects of Fe-EDTA species 
(Klueglein et al., 2015). Experiments with Acidovorax  strains 2AN and BoFeN1 with a molar 
EDTA/Fe(II) ratio of 2:1 resulted in 71 and 47% Fe(II) oxidation in 25 d, respectively 
(Klueglein et al., 2015). On the contrary, when non-chelated Fe(II) was supplemented, Fe(II) 
oxidation reached 90 and 100% within 7 d by Acidovorax  strains 2AN and BoFeN1, 
respectively, indicating the toxic effects of EDTA (Chakraborty et al., 2011). A molar 
EDTA/Fe(II) ratio of 1:1 did not promote the growth of an Actinobacteria  culture and T. 
denitrificans  (Kanaparthi et al., 2013; Kanaparthi and Conrad, 2015). However, the addition 
of 600 mg/L of humic substances as chelating agents resulted in 90 and 45% of Fe(II) 
oxidation and nitrate removal, respectively, by T. denitrificans  (Kanaparthi and Conrad, 
2015). In contrast, humic acids complexation with Fe(II) did not enhance Fe(II) 
bioavailability in experiments with Acidovorax  sp. BoFeN1 (Larese-Casanova et al., 2010). A 
higher [Fe(II)EDTA]2- concentration was used by Kumaraswamy et al. (2006), and no 
inhibition on P. ferrooxidans  strain BDN-1 was observed as Fe(II) oxidation occurred in 2 d. 
 
2.4.2.6 Presence of organics  
As many Fe(II) oxidizing denitrifiers are capable of growing under mixotrophic 
conditions, the supplementation of simple organic electron donors enhances Fe(II) oxidation 
and nitrate removal. Acetate is the most effective organic compound. Typically 1 mol of 
acetate is added per 2.5-10 moles of iron, depending on the microbial culture used (Straub et 
al., 1996; Benz et al., 1998; Kappler et al., 2005; Muehe et al., 2009; Chakraborty et al, 2011; 
Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013a).  
Lactate and benzoate can also be used for Fe(II)-driven autotrophic denitrification as 
demonstrated in sediments incubation (Caldwell et al., 1999). A complete Fe(II) oxidation 
and 87% of nitrate removal occurred in 12 d in presence of lactate or benzoate, whereas an  
49 
 inhibition of the process was reported without addition of organics. Pyruvate stimulates the 
activity of Sphaerotilus natans  strain DSM 6575T leading to a complete Fe(II) oxidation and 
approximately 90% of nitrate removal in 10 d of incubation (Park et al., 2014). Mixotrophic 
growth with 5.0 mM of glucose and 0.3 mM of Fe(II) resulted in a complete nitrate removal 
after 4 d by the strain Klebsiella pneumoniae  L17 (Liu et al., 2014). 
 
2.4.3 Continuous-Flow Experiments 
Iron bioprecipitation and biorecovery as well as heterotrophic and autotrophic 
denitrification have been widely studied as single processes in continuous bioreactors (Das et 
al., 2005; Martins et al., 2011; Chowdhury and Ojumu, 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Montalvo et 
al., 2016). However, to date, only a few research has been carried out on the investigation of 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification in continuous experiments. Zhang et al. (2015) 
used an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed reactor (UASB) with a total working volume of 0.8 L. 
The reactor was inoculated with anaerobic granular sludge taken from a full-scale reactor 
treating paper mill effluents. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was approximately 18 h in 
the first 22 d, and nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation were above 95%. Between days 22 and 
32, HRT was slightly reduced to 17 h, resulting in 60 and 38% of nitrate removal and Fe(II) 
oxidation, respectively. Finally, the process was observed at its steady state during 32-47 d 
with nitrate and Fe(II) removals of 45 and 44%, respectively. The efficiency of the process 
decreased during the experimentation due to the decrease of HRT and pH. The percentage of 
nitrogen removal was above 95% as long as the effluent pH value was over 6.0 before 
dropping to 45% when pH decreased to 4.5. The bioaugmentation of the reactor with 
heterotrophic denitrifying cultures significantly enhanced the performance, as Fe(II) 
oxidation and NO 3- removal reached 99 and 83%, respectively, in 15 d (Wang et al., 2015). 
Fe(II) and As(III) oxidation coupled to autotrophic denitrification was investigated in 
two 420 mL continuous-flow sand packed bed columns, inoculated with activated sludge and 
operated at controlled 30°C with an HRT of 24 h (Sun et al., 2009b). Acetate was used as an 
additional electron donor in order to support microbial depletion of initial DO. One reactor 
was operated with nitrate as electron acceptor and showed up to 10-fold higher Fe(II) and 
As(III) removal than the reactor operated in absence of nitrate. During a 250 d operation, feed 
arsenic was reduced from approximately 570 to 10 µg/L. The iron precipitates contained 7 to 
8-fold higher quantities of Fe and As than those observed in the reactor without nitrate,  
50 
 indicating the importance of biological denitrification in Fe(II) oxidation and As 
immobilization through co-precipitation.  
 
2.4.4 Influence of heavy metals and metalloids 
Heavy metals such as iron, copper, cobalt and nickel can influence the activity of 
denitrifiers by stimulating or inhibiting the microbial activity (Zou et al., 2014). Generally, at 
higher concentrations metals alter the microbial enzyme conformation and block essential 
functional groups (Boopathy, 2000; Giller et al., 2009). On the contrary, if supplemented as 
trace elements, metals can enhance metabolic degradation (Gikas, 2007). Furthermore, longer 
exposure of the bacteria to heavy metals can increase their metal tolerance (Zou et al. 2015) 
through different mechanisms such as the efflux of metal ions outside the cell, accumulation 
and complexation of the metal ions inside the cell, and reduction of the heavy metal ions to a 
less toxic state (Spain, 2003).  
Many studies reported the effect of heavy metals on heterotrophic denitrifying activity 
but metal impact on Fe(II) oxidizing denitrifiers has been poorly investigated. Only the effect 
of As, as both extra electron donor and inhibiting metal, has been studied. Enriched cultures 
of Acidovorax  strain BoFeN1 and Rhodobacter ferrooxidans strain SW2 and the enrichment 
culture KS tolerated As(III) concentrations up to 20-50 μM resulting in complete Fe(II) 
oxidation in 4, 14 and 8 d, respectively (Hohmann et al., 2009). The formation of biogenic 
Fe(III) minerals have the potential to co-precipitate As, mostly as As(V), affecting arsenic  
mobility and bioavailability towards the bacteria (Senn and Hemond, 2002; Sun, 2009a; 
Hohmann et al., 2009; Ahoranta et al., 2016). Similarly, Sun et al. (2009a) demonstrated that 
microbial oxidation of As(III) and Fe(II) linked to denitrification resulted in an enhanced 
immobilization of As(V) onto biogenic Fe(III) (hydr)oxides in sand packed bed columns.  
As(III) is also a potential electron donor for chemolithotrophic denitrification. Li et al. 
(2015) studied the potential for simultaneous removal of nitrate, ferrous iron and arsenite 
from water. The pure culture of Citrobacter freundii  strain PXL1 was enriched on arsenite 
concentration ranging between 2.85 and 13.65 mM. Almost complete Fe(II) oxidation 
occurred in 6 d, with 29% of As(III) removal while reducing 44% of nitrate. 
  
51 
 2.4.5 Biogenic Fe(III) (hydr)oxide products by nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation 
Formation of biogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides minerals from soluble Fe(II) and 
Fe(II)-containing mineral phases can be performed by different microorganisms (Posth et a l., 
2014). Besides the particular microbial culture used, different Fe(III) minerals are formed 
when changing the medium composition, the concentration of possible co-substrates and the 
incubation conditions (pH and temperature). The mineralogy of the formed Fe(III) minerals 
can be influenced and even controlled by the mechanism of Fe(II) oxidation, metabolic rates 
and presence of nucleation sites (Kappler and Straub, 2005; Senko et al., 2005a; Larese-
Casanova et al., 2010; Pankte et al., 2012). 
Different biogenic Fe(III) (hydro)oxide mineral phases are 2-line ferrihydrite, 
goethite, lepidocrocite, hematite, magnetite, maghemite and mixed-phase Fe(II)-Fe(III) 
minerals (green rust), (Weber, 2006a; Konhauser, 2011; Senko et al., 2005a;b). Table 2. 3 
shows the biogenic Fe(III)(hydr)oxide products deriving from Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic 
and mixotrophic denitrification.  
Biogenic Fe oxides, such as lepidocrite ( Ȗ-FeOOH) and goethite ( α-FeOOH), have 
larger specific surface areas and higher binding energy than chemically produced Fe oxides, 
being thus more efficient for heavy metal adsorption (Hennebel et al., 2009). The surface of 
many Fe(III) minerals is positively charged at neutral pH and can adsorb negatively charged 
compounds such as arsenate, phosphate and organic matter (Kappler and Straub, 2005).  
A rapid Fe(II) oxidation leads to the formation of ferrihydrite, while slower oxidation 
can result in green rust and other more crystalline minerals, such as goethite (Lack et al., 
2002b; Senko et al., 2005b). Addition of FeCO 3 leads to the formation of Fe(III) 
oxyhydroxide or ferrihydrite, while the use of FeS results in the production of green rust 
(Hafenbradl et al., 1996). pH also rules the formation of Fe(III) minerals. In the experiments 
performed with Acidovorax  sp. BoFeN1, lepidocrocite was detected at pH 6.3, while at pH 
7.7 goethite was formed (Larese-Casanova et al., 2010). 
Iron minerals are reported to be encrusted or non-encrusted, as the produced Fe(III) 
compound can form a crust around the cells during autotrophic or mixotrophic growth 
(Kappler et al., 2005; Posth et al., 2014). When Fe(II) oxidation is performed out of the cells, 
bacterial metabolism is not affected by encrustation (Benz et al., 1998; Schaedler et al., 2009; 
Ilbert and Bonnefoy, 2013; Posth et al., 2014). The presence of extracellular organic 
compounds that scavenge Fe(III) (Muehe et al., 2009) and the supplementation of chelating 
agents (i.e. EDTA)(Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013b) also prevent Fe(III) mineral  
52 
 precipitation on the cell surface and encrustation. Chakraborty et al, (2011) reported that high 
feed Fe(II) and NO 3- concentrations results in encrustation of the cells. 
The color is also an indicator of the particular Fe(III) mineral formed. Mixed Fe(II)-
Fe(III) hydroxides as major products cause a grayish-green appearance known as g reen rust 
(Straub et al., 1996). At a higher extent of Fe(II) oxidation to Fe(III), the precipitates turn into 
orange (Miot et al., 2009a). Generally, Fe(III) precipitates initially show a white fluffy 
structure that turns into a greenish-gray substance (carbonate-containing green rusts) within a 
week after the start of incubation (Chaudhuri et al., 2001). The white precipitates are 
identified as vivianite deriving from chemical Fe(II) oxidation in both biotic and abiotic 
experiments (Miot et al., 2009a). In biotic tests, after the formation of green rusts, Fe(III) 
precipitates become progressively orange and mainly consist of amorphous Fe(III)-phosphate 
(Miot et al., 2009a; Pantke at al., 2012). Also Fe(III) oxyhydroxide or ferrihydrite generally 
gives the liquid phase an orange/brown color (Lack et al., 2002b ). 
The potential for the reuse of sorbed and coprecipitated elements is an important 
aspect (Finneran, 2002). Green rust is a highly reactive iron mineral and potentially plays a 
key role for the fate of organic and inorganic contaminants, such as chromium or arsenic 
(Pantke et al., 2012). Fe(III) accumulated in the sludge of wastewater treatment plants can be 
recycled and used for phosphorus removal (Nielsen and Nielsen, 1998; Zhang et al., 2015). 
Efficient immobilization of arsenic by biogenic crystalline goethite was reported in Hohmann 
et al. (2009). Fe(III) (hydr)oxides can be also (re)used in different applications, such as 
pigments, catalysts, and co-precipitated with heavy metals (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003).

2.4.6 Supplementation of Fe(II) in form of pyrite (FeS 2) 
Pyrite (FeS 2) is the most abundant sulfide mineral on the earth ’s crust and a major 
source for both iron and sulfur, playing an important role in iron and sulfur cycles (Bosch et 
al., 2012). Under aerobic conditions, iron and sulfur can be oxidized by aerobic 
chemolithotrophic microorganisms such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans  as it usually occurs 
in bioleaching applications. However, pyrite oxidation is not limited to aerobic environments 
because anaerobic pyrite oxidation is thermodynamically feasible involving nitrate as an 
electron acceptor (Bosch et al., 2012 ). 
Pyrite can be a promising electron donor for denitrification especially in mining 
nitrate-environments where pyrite is abundant. The reaction between pyrite and nitrate is 
proton-consuming, with Fe(II), sulfate, and nitrogen gas as end products (Baeseman et al., 
2006 ): 
5FeS 2 + 14NO 3- + 4H+ → 5Fe2+ + 7N 2 (g) + 10SO 42− + 2H 2O  (Eq.2.2)  
Fe(II) is subsequently oxidized: 
      2NO 3- + 10Fe2+ + 12H+ → N 2 + 10Fe3+ + 6H 2O        (Eq.2.3) 
Resulting in the following overall reaction: 
2FeS 2 + 6NO 3- + 4H2O → 2Fe(OH) 3 + 3N2(g) + 4 SO 42− + 2H+    (Eq.2.4) 
 
Pyrite-driven autotrophic denitrification depends on several factors i.e. pyrite grain 
size, initial nitrate concentration, nitrate-loading rate and pH (Torrento et al., 2011). Pyrite is 
stable under severely reducing conditions or at pH lower than 7.4 whereas it is oxidized at 
higher pH. 
Several studies reported the occurrence of nitrate reduction coupled to pyrite 
oxidation (Schwientek et al., 2008; Jorgensen et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009; Bosch et al., 
2012; Zhang et al., 2012), indicating that pyrite is an effective electron donor capable of 
stimulating denitrification even in presence of organics (Zhang et al., 2012). However, in 
comparison with other compounds, lower denitrification efficiencies have been observed 
when using pyrite as electron donor. Bosch et al. (2012) observed a 10% pyrite oxidation to 
Fe(III) with a nitrate removal efficiency of 15% by using T. denitrificans . The addition of 
pyrite increased the proportion of denitrifying bacteria closely related to the 
Xanthomonadaceae  species , responsible for autotrophic denitrification (Torrento et al., 
2011).   
57 
 The main shortcomings of pyrite oxidation coupled to denitrification are sulfate 
production and trace metal release (e.g. nickel and arsenic) as well as the production of 
additional intermediate products such as nitrite and nitrous oxide (Zhang et al., 2012).  
 
2.5 Conclusions 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification is a promising biotechnology for 
concomitant nitrate and ferrous iron removal and recovery/reuse of iron in the form of Fe(III) 
minerals. Many microorganisms are capable of performing the process as pure cultures or in 
mixed incubations. The use of neutral or slightly alkaline pH is encouraged as most microbial 
species are neutrophilic and Fe(II)-driven denitrification results in the production of acidity. 
Pyrite can be a promising electron donor for Fe(II) mediated autotrophic denitrification, as it 
is abundant in mining environments. Feed Fe(II) concentrations as high as 25 mM are 
generally tolerated by microorganisms, but the use of EDTA as Fe chelator at neutral pH ca n 
result in an inhibition of the microbial activity. In most cases, nitrate removal can be 
enhanced by supplementing small amounts of acetate or other simple organics. The biogenic 
Fe(III) minerals produced have potential to be reused in environmental and commercial 
applications. However, the mineral characterization of the biogenic Fe(III) precipitates has 
been poorly investigated. Additional work is also required to better investigate the influence 
of other metals on Fe(II)-mediated denitrification and the potential of the process in 
continuous-flow experiments for a possible future application in full-scale plants.

 3.1 Introduction 
Nitrate is one of the most common pollutants in water resources worldwide (Park and 
Yoo, 2009; Zhang et al. , 2015). Nitrate contamination is mainly caused by the use of 
agricultural fertilizers (Viers et al. , 2012 ; Qambrani et al. , 2013) and the uncontrolled 
discharge of industrial and domestic wastewaters (Zhang et al. , 2015 ; Bhandari et al. , 2016). 
Moreover, nitrate is often associated with mining activity due to use of large amounts of 
explosives such as ‘ammonium nitrate fuel oil ’ (ANFO) (Zaitsev et al. , 2008). In mining 
environments, nitrate co-occurs with several metal species, including iron (Papirio et al. , 
2014). 
Nitrate is mainly removed from wastewaters by heterotrophic denitrification (Ashok 
and Hait, 2015). Denitrification can also be used for the treatment of metal-containing 
wastewaters (Zou et al. , 2014, 2015). Fe(II) has been demonstrated to stimulate heterotrophic 
denitrification (Papirio et al. , 2014) and is also an effective electron donor for autotrophic 
denitrification (Straub et al. , 1996). The first microorganisms capable of maintaining 
biological nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation were discovered only 20 years ago (Straub et 
al., 1996). The use of denitrifying Fe(II) oxidizers results in the reduction of nitrate to 
nitrogen gas and the bioprecipitation/biorecovery of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, with the possible 
co-precipitation or adsorption of other metal s (Hohmann et al. , 2009; Ahoranta et al. , 2016). 
The complete reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas with Fe(II) as electron donor is as 
suggested by Sorensen (1987) (see eq.2.1). 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification is advantageous over classical 
heterotrophic denitrification for the treatment of low-organic wastewaters. The addition of 
simple organic compounds would increase the operational costs and induce secondary 
organic pollution (Zhang et al. , 2015). Nevertheless, the use of waste activated sludge 
fermentation liquid as carbon source can enhance the denitrification efficiency, by keeping 
the treatment costs low as no organic substrates are supplemented (Ji and Chen, 2010). 
Moreover, the anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification can be considered as an 
alternative for the treatment of organic-deficient wastewaters (Wang et al. , 2017). 
Nitrate dependent Fe(II) oxidation has been reported in both mixed enrichments and 
pure cultures isolated from various habitats (Weber et al. , 2006a; Kiskira et al. , 2017). A 
circumneutral feed pH and a molar Fe(II)/NO 3- ratio of 5 have mostly been used in the 
existing literature (Straub et al. , 1996; Weber et al. , 2006b; Blöthe and Roden, 2009). None  
75 
 of the known Fe(II)-oxidizing denitrifiers has been reported to be acidophilic, and the 
knowledge of their possible acclimation to acidic environments still remains limited. 
Thiobacillus denitrificans  and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 are microorganisms 
capable of performing Fe(II)-driven autotrophic denitrification. The two microbial species are 
both located in the subclass of the Proteobacteria  and are reported to grow as anaerobic 
chemolithotrophs (Kelly and Wood, 2000; Weber et al., 2006b). T. denitrificans  can be found 
in soil, mud, freshwater, marine sediments and also in domestic sewage and industrial 
wastewater treatment ponds. It has widely been reported to use reduced sulfur compounds 
(e.g. thiosulfate, elemental sulfur and sulfide) as electron donors, but contradictory results 
have been obtained for the capability of T. denitrificans  to use Fe(II) (Straub et al., 1996: 
Muehe et al. , 2009). Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 has been observed in freshwater and 
paddy soils used for the cultivation of rice and soybean (Tago et al ., 2011). Unlike T. 
denitrificans , Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 is a strictly nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidizing 
microorganism (Weber et al. , 2006b, 2009). 
As Fe(II) is not stable at circumneutral pH, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is 
commonly employed as chelating agent in order to promote a higher Fe(II) solubilization. An 
attentive supplementation of EDTA is required, as EDTA is an organic pollutant which is 
persistent in the environment (Oviedo and Rodríguez, 2003). Moreover, EDTA often leads to 
the inhibition of the activity of several denitrifying Fe(II)-oxidizing species (Kumaraswamy 
et al., 2006; Kanaparthi et al., 2013; Klueglein et al., 2015). Further research is therefore 
needed in order to evaluate the most suitable EDTA:Fe(II) ratio that does not result in 
microbial inhibition, while enhancing Fe(II) solubility. For instance, EDTA can be recycled  
and reused, mitigating the organic pollution and lowering the operational costs (Juang and 
Wang, 2000). 
The objectives of this work were 1) to investigate the efficiency of Fe(II)-mediated 
autotrophic denitrification in terms of Fe(II) oxidation and nitrate removal with different 
microbial cultures in batch bioassays; 2) to evaluate the effects of decreasing pH on the 
process; 3) to determine the optimal EDTA/Fe(II) ratio.  
76 
 3.2 Materials and Methods 
3.2.1 Sources of microorganisms and cultivation mineral media 
The chemolithotrophic denitrifying cultures used in this study were: (1) a Thiobacillus -
dominated mixed culture previously enriched on thiosulfate and nitrate (Di Capua et al. , 
2016; Zou et al. , 2016); (2) an activated sludge inoculum collected from the municipal 
wastewater plant in Cassino (Italy); (3) a pure culture of Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 
(DSM 18807); (4) a pure culture of T. denitrificans (DSM 12475). Both pure cultures were 
purchased from the ‘Leibniz-Institute DSMZ- German collection of microorganisms and cell 
cultures ’ in Braunschweig (Germany). 
The two denitrifying mixed cultures were enriched under anaerobic conditions for 1 
month in batch mode in 125 mL serum flasks. Fe(II) and NO 3- concentrations were 10 and 2 
mM, respectively. The basal medium was prepared with the following components (g·L-1): 
2.00 NaHCO 3, 0.25 NH 4Cl, 0.30 KH 2PO 4, 0.40 K 2H2PO 4, and 0.10 NaCl. The trace mineral 
solution was added from a sterile stock solution and prepared by dissolving the following in a 
1.5 g L-1 nitrilotriacetic acid disodium salt solution (g·L−1): 3.00 MgSO 4⋅7H2O, 0.50 MnSO 4, 
1.00 NaCl, 0.10 FeSO 4⋅7H2O, 0.10 CaCl 2⋅2H2O, 0.10 CoCl 2⋅6H2O, 0.13 ZnCl, 0.01 
CuSO 4⋅5H2O, 0.01 AlK(SO 4)2⋅12H 2O, 0.01 H 3BO 3, 0.025 Na 2MoO 4⋅2H2O (Weber et al. , 
2009). 
The two pure cultures were preliminary cultivated by using two different mineral 
media. The mineral medium used for the Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 culture contained 
the following components (g·L-1): 5.0 peptone, 2.0 meat extract, and 15.0 agar. pH was 
adjusted to 7.0. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 121°C for 15 min. The medium 
used for the activation of the T. denitrificans  culture consisted of four different solutions, as 
reported by Zou et al.  (2016). Fe(II) and NO 3- concentrations were the same of those used for 
the cultivation of Thiobacillus -mixed and activated sludge cultures. 
All the incubations were maintained in absence of light at 22 ± 2°C on a gyratory 
shaker (80 rpm). After the enrichment, all the microbial cultures were seeded in the serum 
bottles used for the batch experiments. 
  
77 
 3.2.2 Preparation of the experiments 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification was studied in batch bioassays by using 125 
mL serum bottles. All the bottles were maintained at room temperature (22 ± 2°C). Each 
bottle contained the basal medium and trace elements, as described in section 2.1. Fe(II) and 
NO 3- were added in concentration of 10 and 2 mM, respectively. Thiosulfate (S 2O32-) in 
concentration of 0.5 mM was used as an additional electron donor in the experiments 
performed with the  Thiobacillus -mixed and pure T. denitrificans  cultures. Fe(II), NO 3- and 
S2O32- were added in the form of iron(II) chloride (FeCl 2·4H 2O), sodium nitrate (NaNO 3) and 
sodium thiosulfate (NaS 2O3), respectively. EDTA in molar ratios of 2:1, 1:1 and 0.5:1 with 
Fe(II) was used as chelating agent. All the chemicals were of analytical grade (Sigma 
Aldrich, Germany). 
The feed pH (7.0, 6.0 and 5.0) was adjusted by adding NaOH and HCl before flushing 
the bottles with He in order to maintain anoxic conditions. The dissolved oxygen (DO) was 
below 0.3 mg·L-1. Bicarbonate (2 g·L-1 as NaHCO 3) was added to each bottle as buffer and 
inorganic carbon source. The enrichment cultures were added to the bottles in the amount of 
10% v/v. This resulted in an initial volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of 180, 
300, 380 and 720 mg VSS·L-1 in the bottles inoculated with Thiobacillus -mixed, pure T. 
denitrificans , activated sludge and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 cultures, respectively. 
Finally, the bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps and placed 
on a gyratory shaker at 250 rpm. Microcosms were prepared in duplicate. For each mic robial 
culture, controls without electron donors were carried out to monitor the degradation of NO 3-, 
which was not associated with chemolithotrophic denitrification. Abiotic controls were also 
performed for possible chemical reactions between Fe(II), NO 3- and/or S 2O32-. 
 
3.2.3 Batch bioassays 
The batch experiments were conducted as described in Table 3.1. The four inocula were 
individually investigated in each experiment. In Experiment 1, Fe(II) was used as sole 
electron donor for chemolithotrophic denitrification using all the four cultures at pH 7.0 and a 
EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0. In Experiment 2, the potential of thiosulfate as additional electron 
donor was investigated in the bioassays seeded with the Thiobacillus -mixed and pure T. 
denitrificans  cultures under the same operating conditions of Experiment 1. Thiosulfate was  
78 
 added in concentration of 0.5 mM, lower than the theoretical amount indicated by the molar 
NO 3-:S2O32- ratio of 1.6:1.0 (Manconi et al., 2007).  
In Experiment 3, the Thiobacillus -mixed and pure T. denitrificans  cultures cultivated on 
Fe(II) and thiosulfate and the activated sludge and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 cultures 
cultivated on the sole Fe(II) were subcultured in a new medium prepared at pH 7.0 and with a 
EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0. In Experiment 4, the effect of decreasing EDTA concentrations 
(20, 10 and 5 mM) and pH (7.0 and 6.0) was evaluated by using the enrichment cultures from 
Experiment 3. In Experiment 5, the use of Fe(II) as sole electron donor at pH 5.0 and 
EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 0.5 was investigated by using the enriched Thiobacillus -mixed, pure T. 
denitrificans  and activated sludge cultures from Experiment 3.

3.2.4 Sampling and analytical methods  
Ferrous iron, nitrate, thiosulfate and pH were analyzed at t=0, after 6 h on day 1 and, 
subsequently, every 24 h after day 1 until day 10. Samples were taken with 5-mL disposable 
syringes. NO 3- and S 2O32- concentration was analyzed by ion chromatography (IC) with 
chemically suppressed conductivity using a 883 Basic IC Plus system equipped with a 
Metrosep A Supp 5-150/4.0 column and a 863 Compact IC Autosampler (Metrohm, 
Switzerland). The liquid samples were filtered with 0.22 μm syringe cellulose membranes  
79 
 (EMD Millipore, USA) prior to IC analysis. Ferrous iron was quantified photometrically by 
using a Lambda 10 UV-Vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, USA), following the analytical 
method reported by Ahoranta et al. , (2016). Fe(II) determination was performed immediately 
after the sampling, for avoiding Fe(II) chemical oxidation. DO and pH measurements were 
performed with a Multimeter 3410 (WTW, Germany) equipped with a FDO® 925 and a 
SenTix® 140-3 pH electrode, respectively. VSS were analyzed according to the standard 
methods (APHA, 1992). Gas samples were not taken from the headspace of the bottles. The 
production of NO and N 2O was not evaluated. 
 
3.3 Results and discussion 
3.3.1 Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification with pH 7.0 and EDTA:Fe(II) 2.0 
3.3.1.1 Supplementation of Fe(II) as sole electron donor with the four initial cultures 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification was investigated in batch experiments 
under different operating conditions. Table 3.2 reports the nitrate removal and Fe(II) 
oxidation achieved in all the batch bioassays after 10 d. In all experiments, no nitrite was 
detected as intermediate of denitrification and pH remained stable at 7.0. 
Fig. 3.1a shows the results obtained in Experiment 1, using Fe(II) as sole electron 
donor in the bioassays seeded with the four initial inocula. The pure T. denitrificans  culture 
was capable of maintaining Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification. The specific average 
nitrate removal rate was 2.7 mg/(g VSS·d). The molar Fe(II):NO 3- ratio constantly ranged 
between 3.5 and 5.0, indicating that denitrification proceeded in a good agreement with the 
stoichiometry (Eq. 3.1). After 10 d, Fe(II) oxidation reached 66%, whereas nitrate removal 
was 52%. Conversely, denitrification did not occur in the bioassays with the Thiobacillus -
mixed culture. Fe(II) oxidation was 35%, but not associated with nitrate removal. Fe(II) was 
oxidized most likely due to the chemical reaction with residual DO, in agreement with what 
observed in abiotic controls. The profile of Fe(II) in the abiotic controls was as reported in 
Fig. 3.1a. Fe(II) concentration decreased by 35% in the first 4 d due to chemical oxidation. 
NO 3- concentration did not significantly change over 10 d in both free electron donor and 
abiotic controls.

The feasibility of Fe(II)-driven denitrification with a pure culture of T. denitrificans is 
still contradictory. Straub et al. (1996) observed nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation under 
strictly autotrophic conditions with a Fe(II):NO 3- molar ratio of 5:1. Fe(II) oxidation occurred 
in 8 weeks, but no information for nitrate removal was presented. In contrast, Muehe et al.  
(2009) did not observe Fe(II) oxidation coupled to autotrophic denitrification. The addition of 
organic compounds, i.e. humic substances, was needed to stimulate both Fe(II) and NO 3- 
removal, likely due to the enhanced Fe(II) complexation and bioavailability (Kanaparthi and 
Conrad, 2015).

Thiobacillus- mixed culture (TM) (□), pure T. denitrificans culture (TDP) (Δ), activated sludg e inoculum (AS) (○) and 
Pseudogulbenkiania strain 2002 culture (PG) (x). Standard deviations are in the  range 0.02-0.65 mM. 
 
In this study, the specific nitrate removal rate obtained with activated sludge inoculum 
was 2.4 mg/(g VSS·d), slightly lower than that achieved with T. denitrificans  (Fig. 3.1a ). 
Fe(II) oxidation and nitrate removal were 83% and 72%, respectively, at the end of the 
experiments. The molar ratio between oxidized Fe(II) and removed nitrate was in the range 
2.2 - 4.8, in agreement with Nielsen and Nielsen (1998). However, Nielsen and Nielsen 
 
82 
 (1998) reported a much faster Fe(II)-based denitrification as 3 mM of Fe(II) was oxidized in  
5 h coupled to the removal of 1 mM of nitrate. 
Although Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 is a more specialized microbial culture in 
maintaining Fe(II)-based autotrophic denitrification, the use of Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 
2002 resulted in the lowest specific NO 3- removal rate, i.e. 1.0 mg/(g VSS·d) (Fig. 3.1a). 
Fe(II) oxidation reached 54%, whereas nitrate removal was 55%. The molar Fe(II):NO 3- ratio 
was in the range 4.6-5.5, in a good agreement with the stoichiometry (Eq. 2.1). The high 
EDTA concentration most probably repressed the microbial activity of Pseudogulbenkiania  
strain 2002. A slow nitrate removal with Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 was also observed 
by Weber et al.  (2006b), even in the absence of EDTA. In their study, Pseudogulbenkiania  
strain 2002 only oxidized 25% of the initial 10 mM Fe(II) and 22% of the fed 2.2 mM nitrate 
in 7 d. 
 
3.3.1.2 Supplementation of S 2O32- as additional electron donor to the Thiobacillus -mixed 
and pure T. denitrificans  cultures 
The capability for Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification of the previously Fe(II)-
enriched Thiobacillus -mixed culture was investigated by supplementing thiosulfate in 
Experiment 2 (Fig. 3.2). Thiosulfate was completely oxidized in 4 d. At this stage, nitrate 
removal reached up to 73% with a specific nitrate removal rate of 14.7 mg/(g VSS·d). About 
46% of the initial nitrate was removed by thiosulfate-driven denitrification, according to the 
stoichiometry reported by Manconi et al.  (2007). The remaining 27% of nitrate was removed 
by Fe(II)-oxidizing metabolism. Aside the initial Fe(II) drop to 4 mM due to chemical 
oxidation, Fe(II) oxidation was 37% after 4 d, indicating that Fe(II) oxidation was almost 
completely associated with autotrophic denitrification. From day 5 on, nitrate removal was 
only 9% with Fe(II) as sole electron donor. A s also observed in Experiment 1, the 
Thiobacillus -mixed culture was not able to maintain Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic 
denitrification in absence of thiosulfate. The specific nitrate removal rate dropped to 1.2 
mg/(g VSS·d), whereas the iron oxidation rate remained constant. 
The effect of thiosulfate as supplementary electron donor was also tested on the pure 
T. denitrificans  culture (Fig. 3.2). As long as thiosulfate was present, the specific nitrate 
removal rate was 4.7 mg/(g VSS·d). In the absence of thiosulfate, denitrification proceeded  
83 
 with a nitrate removal rate of 2.5 mg/(g VSS·d). The overall nitrate removal rate was 3.6 
mg/(g VSS·d), i.e. 34% higher than that achieved in Experiment 1.  
 
Figure 3.2 : The evolution of NO 3-, S2O32- and Fe(II) during Experiment 2 for TM (□) and TDP (Δ). Standard deviations are 
in the range 0.02-0.65. 
 
Both the Thiobacillus -mixed and pure T. denitrificans  cultures were stimulated by 
supplementing thiosulfate as additional electron donor. However, the increase of nitrate 
removal rate was more significant for Thiobacillus -mixed culture, as the prolonged 
enrichment of the Thiobacillus -mixed culture on S 2O32- in a previous study (Di Capua et al. , 
2016) resulted in a microbial community specialized in using thiosulfate as sole electron 
 
84 
 donor. Conversely, the pure T. denitrificans  culture demonstrated to use Fe(II) more 
efficiently than the Thiobacillus -mixed culture. 
 
3.3.1.3 Supplementation of Fe(II) as sole electron donor with all the acclimated and 
enriched cultures 
After enriching and acclimating the Thiobacillus -mixed and pure T. denitrificans  
cultures on thiosulfate, Fe(II)-based denitrification was again investigated with Fe(II) as sole 
electron donor. The use of a more enriched Thiobacillus -mixed culture resulted in a higher 
biological Fe(II) oxidation coupled to denitrification (Fig. 3.1b). The specific nitrate removal 
rate significantly increased and reached 8.6 mg/(g VSS·d). Fe(II) oxidation and NO 3- 
reduction were 68 and 83%, respectively. Thiobacillus thioparus  predominated over T. 
denitrificans in the microbial community (Di Capua et al. , 2016). T. thioparus  has previously 
been reported as an obligate thiosulfate-oxidizing chemolithotrophic denitrifier, not capable 
of using Fe(II) (Robertson and Kuenen, 2006). However, after a prolonged enrichment on 
Fe(II) and S 2O32-, the combined Fe(II)-oxidizing activity of T. thioparus and T. denitrificans  
was considerably enhanced, also in the presence of Fe(II) as sole electron donor. 
Denitrification coupled to Fe(II) oxidation was also stimulated by subculturing the 
pure T. denitrificans  culture in a fresh medium. The specific nitrate removal rate was 4.4 
mg/(g VSS·d), compared to 2.7 mg/(g VSS·d) obtained in Experiment 1. Nitrate removal was 
82% and Fe(II) oxidation was 95%. 
In contrast, nitrate removal in the bioassays with activated sludge and 
Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 cultures was less significantly enhanced after the subculture 
of the microbial cells (Fig. 3.1b). Compared to Experiment 1, the specific nitrate removal rate 
only increased by 8% for activated sludge inoculum, whereas it rose from 1.0 to 1.2 mg/(g 
VSS·d) for Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002. Nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation were 66 
and 45% for activated sludge inoculum and 54 and 64% for Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002, 
respectively. A slower Fe(II) oxidation was observed for the activated sludge inoculum than 
that obtained in Experiment 1, most probably due to an optimization of denitrification that 
required a lower Fe(II) amount to achieve the same nitrate removal. 
The rates of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification obtained in this work were 
lower than those reported in similar batch experiments aimed at investigating classical 
heterotrophic denitrification or sulfur-driven autotrophic denitrification. For instance, Papirio  
85 
 et al . (2014) observed a nitrate removal rate up to approximately 400 mg·L-1·d-1 by using 
denitrifying cultures enriched on ethanol. A N- NO 3- removal rate of 52.2 mg·L-1·d-1, i.e. 3-
fold higher than the highest achieved in this study, was obtained by Di Capua et al.  (2016) 
under chemolithotrophic conditions with S 2O32- as electron donor. However, the 
implementation of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification in continuous-flow bioreactors 
is expected to result in higher nitrate removal rates. Under these operating conditions, a 
higher biomass concentration can be used leading to an enhanced denitrification efficiency 
(Zhang et al. , 2015). 
In comparison with heterotrophic and sulfur-based autotrophic denitrification, Fe(II)-
mediated autotrophic denitrification does not result in nitrite and this represents a major 
advantage as nitrite is reported to be inhibitory for many denitrifiers and nitrogen can be 
entirely removed from the liquid phase (Straub et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 2015). 
 
3.3.2 Effect of the EDTA:Fe(II) ratio 
EDTA is widely used in many environmental applications such as metal recovery from 
wastewaters and soils (Di Palma et al. , 2003). The use of EDTA results in increasing 
treatment costs, but EDTA can be effectively recycled and suitable for reuse without losing 
its chelating properties (Juang and Wang, 2000; Di Palma et al. , 2003). In Fe(II)-mediated 
autotrophic denitrification, EDTA is used to improve Fe(II) solubility and bioavailability. An 
EDTA-recycling step after denitrification can be an interesting option to enhance the 
economic feasibility of the overall process (Zeng et al. , 2005). 
The dosing of EDTA is of major importance in Fe(II)-based denitrification. Microbial 
activity can be influenced by the molar EDTA:Fe(II) ratio as microbial cultures differentl y 
tolerate the inhibitory effects of free EDTA and Fe-EDTA species (Klueglein et al. , 2015). In 
this study, the effect of decreasing EDTA on Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification was 
investigated in Experiment 4. The NO 3- removal efficiency achieved at EDTA:Fe(II) ratios of 
2.0, 1.0 and 0.5 was as shown in Fig. 3.3. 
When using the Thiobacillus -mixed culture, the specific nitrate removal rate was 8.8 , 
10.3 and 10.5 mg/(g VSS·d) at pH 7.0 and 10.4, 10.1 and 10.5 mg/(g VSS·d) at pH 6.0 with 
an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0, 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. The specific nitrate removal rate 
increased from 4.7 to 6.1 mg/(g VSS·d)  by decreasing the EDTA:Fe(II) ratio from 2.0 to 1.0 
with the pure T. denitrificans  culture at pH 7.0. A similar trend was observed at pH 6.0, with  
86 
 the specific nitrate removal rate increasing from 2.4 to 2.6 and 3.3 mg/(g VSS·d) with an 
EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0, 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. 
The specific nitrate removal rate was 4.3 and 4.9 mg/(g VSS·d) for activated sludge 
inoculum at pH 7.0 and 6.0, respectively, with an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0. An increase of 
the nitrate removal rate by 9 and 29% was observed by decreasing the EDTA:Fe(II) ratio to 
1.0 at pH 7.0 and 6.0, respectively. The highest nitrate removal rate was obtained with an 
EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 0.5, i.e. 4.8 and 5.2 mg/(g VSS·d) at pH 7.0 and 6.0, respectively. 
The most significant effect of the EDTA concentration was observed with the 
Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 culture, indicating the lower tolerance of this species to 
EDTA. The lowest molar EDTA:Fe (II) ratio resulted in an almost double nitrate removal 
rate compared to that achieved with an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0. The specific nitrate removal 
rate increased from 1.8 to 2.5 and 3.3 mg/(g VSS·d), with a decreasing EDTA:Fe(II) ratio. A 
less significant increase was observed at pH 6.0, with nitrate removal rates of 1.7 , 2.2 and 2.5 
mg/(g VSS·d) with an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0, 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. 
The decrease of feed EDTA from 20 to 5 mM resulted in an increase of Fe(II) 
oxidation by 48, 14, and 49% at pH 7.0 in the experiments with Thiobacillus -mixed, activated 
sludge and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 cultures, respectively. Fe(II) oxidation increased 
by 12, 17 and 23% in the experiments with Thiobacillus -mixed, pure T. denitrificans  and 
activated sludge cultures, respectively, at pH 6.0. A decrease of 10% was observed at pH 7.0 
for the pure T. denitrificans  culture, whereas Fe(II) oxidation was 48% lower at pH 6.0 for 
Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002. The Fe(II) oxidation rate was not significantly affected by 
the decreasing EDTA concentrations at pH 6.0 in the other microbial cultures. Denitrification 
was also maintained at the lowest EDTA:Fe(II) ratio, indicating that the low EDTA 
efficiently chelated Fe(II) and promoted its bioavailability. 
This study demonstrated that a ll the investigated cultures were alleviated by the 
decrease of EDTA. Free EDTA is generally the most toxic EDTA form to bacteria as it 
disrupts the cell membranes (Oviedo and Rodríguez, 2003). However, Chakraborty and 
Picardal (2013) reported a negligible amount of free EDTA at an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0, 
simulated by the Visual MINTEQ software. At a lower extent, EDTA toxicity can also be 
associated with chelated Fe(II)-EDTA and Fe(III)-EDTA species (Klueglein et al. , 2015). In 
this study, the mechanism of inhibition by EDTA at the higher EDTA:Fe(II) ratios remains  
87 
 unclear. In spite of this, a faster metabolic activity was observed during the enrichment of all 
cultures.

of 2.0, 1.0 and 0.5.  
 
3.3.3 Influence of the initial pH 
The effect of decreasing pH from 7.0 to 6.0 on Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic 
denitrification was investigated in Experiment 4. A further pH decrease to 5.0 was assessed 
 
88 
 with the Thiobacillus -mixed, pure T. denitrificans  and activated sludge cultures in 
Experiment 5. 
It is known that pH affects microbial activity and iron speciation (Hedrich et al. , 
2011). At pH < 4.0, Fe(II) is more stable but the inhibition of most denitrifiers occurs. 
Conversely, a neutral pH is favorable for biological activity but Fe(II) is quickly oxidized 
with oxygen (Johnson  et al. , 2012). The known Fe(II)-oxidizing denitrifiers are neutrophilic 
(Hedrich et al. , 2011), and therefore up to now the majority of studies was performed at pH 
between 6.0 and 8.0 (Kiskira et al. , 2017). 
Studies investigating the optimal pH on the process with pure and mixed cultures 
reported that pH should not be below 6.0 (Straub et al. , 2004; Oshiki et al. , 2013; Zhang et 
al., 2015). Only some uncultured Actinobacteria were found to be capable of performing 
Fe(II)-driven denitrification at pH 4.5 (Kanaparthi et al. , 2013). 
In this study, the activity of the Thiobacillus -mixed and activated sludge enrichments 
was enhanced by decreasing pH from 7.0 to 6.0 (Fig. 3.3). With an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0, 
the specific nitrate removal rate increased from 8.8 to 10.4 mg/(g VSS·d) for the 
Thiobacillus -mixed culture. A slight increase of denitrification efficiency was also observed 
for the activated sludge inoculum, with the nitrate removal rate increasing from 4.8 mg/(g 
VSS·d) at pH 7.0 to 5.2 mg/(g VSS·d) at pH 6.0, with an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 0.5. Nielsen 
and Nielsen (1998) reported a more significant pH dependence of an activated sludge 
inoculum, with an optimal pH of 8.0. At pH 8.0, the Fe(II) oxidation rate was 0.132 mM 
Fe(II)·(g VSS·h)-1, which was 2 times higher than that at pH 7.0, and almost 4 times higher 
than that at pH 6.0 and 5.0. Nielsen and Nielsen (1998) did not perform any previous 
enrichment on Fe(II), most likely inducing a higher pH dependence of Fe(II)-mediated 
denitrification. 
In this study, the two pure cultures of T. denitrificans and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 
2002 demonstrated to be less tolerant to decreasing pH. The decrease of pH from 7.0 to 6.0 
resulted in a lower denitrification efficiency in the experiments with Pseudogulbenkiania  
strain 2002, with all the EDTA:Fe(II) ratios tested. In agreement, Weber et al.  (2009) 
reported a faster growth of Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 at a pH ranging between 6.8 and 
8.0. A significant decrease of nitrate removal rate was also observed for the T. denitrificans  
culture at pH 6.0. The nitrate removal rate dropped from 4.7 , 6.1 and 5.9 to 2.4, 2.6 and 3.3 
mg/(g VSS·d) by decreasing pH from 7.0 to 6.0 with an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0, 1.0 and  
89 
 0.5, respectively. The optimal pH for maintaining sulfur-driven denitrification with T. 
denitrificans  is approximately 6.9 (Kelly and Wood, 2000). A better activity of T. 
denitrificans  at neutral pH was confirmed in this study, by using Fe(II) as electron donor. 
However, to the best of the authors ’ knowledge, no information concerning the optimal pH in 
Fe(II)-mediated denitrification by T. denitrificans  had previously been reported. 
The effect of pH 5.0 with an EDTA:Fe(II) molar ratio of 0.5 was also investigated for 
the Thiobacillus -mixed, pure T. denitrificans  and activated sludge cultures in Experiment 5 
(Fig. 3.4). Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 was not tested at pH 5.0, as nitrate removal rate 
was significantly low at pH 6.0. The efficiency of denitrification considerably decreased at 
pH 5.0 for all the microbial enrichments. The specific nitrate removal rate dropped from 10.5, 
3.3 and 5.2 mg/(g VSS·d) to 3.7, 1.5 and 1.5 mg/(g VSS·d), by decreasing the pH from 6.0 to 
5.0 with the Thiobacillus -mixed, pure T. denitrificans  and activated sludge cultures, 
respectively. 
Both chemical and biological Fe(II) oxidation coupled to denitrification were 
repressed at decreasing pH, resulting in lower Fe(II) oxidation rates in almost all the 
experiments.

 3.4 Conclusions 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification was effectively maintained with two pure 
and two enriched mixed cultures. Nitrate removal was above 60% in all the bioassays 
operated at pH 7.0 and an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0. After a longer acclimation to Fe(II) and 
stimulation with S 2O32-, the Thiobacillus -mixed culture resulted in the highest specific nitrate 
removal rate, equal to 8.8 mg/(g VSS·d). Decreasing EDTA:Fe(II) ratios resulted in higher 
nitrate removal efficiency and rates. With EDTA:Fe(II) ratios of 1.0 and 0.5, denitrification 
was particularly enhanced for Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002, which less tolerated EDTA. 
At pH 6.0, the activity of T. denitrificans  and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 was repressed, 
whereas a faster denitrification was observed for the Thiobacillus -mixed and AS cultures. 
The use of pH 5.0 resulted in a 65, 75 and 69% slower nitrate removal than at pH 7.0 for the 
Thiobacillus -mixed, pure T. denitrificans  and activated sludge cultures, respectively.

CHAPTER 4 
 
Effect of copper, nickel and zinc on Fe(II)-
mediated autotrophic denitrification

 4.1 Introduction 
Nitrate is a common pollutant in municipal and industrial wastewaters. The extensive 
use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and chemicals is among the main reasons of nitrate 
contamination of water bodies (Viers et al., 2012). Moreover, nitrate often co-occurs with 
metals and heavy metals (HMs), such as iron, copper, cobalt and nickel in mining water 
streams (Papirio et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2014). The presence of HMs in the water resources is 
a major concern (Ochoa-Herrera et al., 2011; Santos and Judd, 2010), with several industrial 
activities being mostly responsible for their discharge in the hydrosphere (Karvelas et al., 
2003). 
The microbial activity of microorganisms capable for denitrification can be either 
stimulated or inhibited by the presence of HMs. The supplementation of trace metals can 
enhance metabolic degradation, whereas the excess of metals usually represses the activity of 
most denitrifiers (Gikas, 2007). Microbes can tolerate increasing metal concentrations by 
developing particular mechanisms such as the efflux of metal ions outside the cell, the 
accumulation and complexation of the metal ions inside the cell, and the reduction of the HM 
ions to a less toxic state (Spain, 2003). However, at higher concentrations, metals can change 
the microbial enzyme conformation and block essential functional groups (Giller et al., 
2009). Besides the amount and type of HM, the toxicity of HMs can be influenced by many 
factors such as the temperature, the presence of specific chemical substances, the metal 
speciation and bioavailability, and the concomitant presence of other HMs or major elements 
such as calcium (Gikas, 2008). 
Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are among the most common polluting metal ions in 
industrial effluents and are associated with toxicity issues. In experiments with anoxic-
membrane bioreactors, the presence of Cu and Zn at a concentration of approximately 2.6 and 
32.3 mg/L repressed the denitrification rate by 20 and 34%, respectively (Feng et al., 2013). 
In contrast, nickel (Ni) has been found to enhance the growth of microorganisms at 
concentrations below 5 mg Ni/L (Gikas, 2008), and denitrifiers have been observed to 
tolerate Ni concentrations up to 500 mg Ni/L (Zou et al., 2015). A longer exposure of the 
bacteria to metals can increase their metal tolerance, thus promoting denitrification 
(Sakadevan et al., 1999; Zou et al., 2015). 
The effect of HMs has been mostly investigated on nitrifying (Hu et al., 2004; Lee et 
al., 2009) and heterotrophic denitrifying microbial cultures (Lawrence et al., 2004; Ochoa- 
98 
 Herrera et al., 2011; Sakadevan et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2013). However, the knowledge 
about the metal influence on Fe(II)-oxidizing autotrophic denitrifiers remains limited (Kiskira 
et al., 2017a). Hohmann et al. (2009) studied the effect of arsenic(III) as inhibiting element 
and reported that the enriched cultures of Acidovorax  strain BoFeN1, Rhodobacter 
ferrooxidans  strain SW2 and the enrichment culture KS tolerated up to 20-50 mM of As(III), 
resulting in a complete Fe(II) oxidation. To the authors ’ knowledge, the impact of Cu, Ni and 
Zn as inhibitors of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification and the possibility of 
precipitating them with the biogenic Fe(III) hydro(oxides) have not yet been investigated. 
Therefore, the objectives of this work were 1) to investigate the efficiency and 
specific rates of nitrate removal during Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification in the 
presence of Cu, Ni and Zn in batch bioassays, and 2) to evaluate how four different microbial 
cultures, i.e. a Thiobacillus -dominated mixed culture, an activated sludge enrichment, and 
two pure cultures of Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002 and T. denitrificans , tolerated the presence 
of Cu, Ni and Zn.  
 
4.2 Materials and methods 
4.2.1 Sources of microorganisms and mineral growth media 
 
Four chemolithotrophic denitrifying cultures were used in this study. A Thiobacillus -
dominated mixed culture, developed in experiments with thiosulfate as electron donor (Di 
Capua et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2016), and an activated sludge enrichment, originally collected 
from the municipal wastewater plant in Cassino (Italy), were used as mixed bacterial 
consortia. Then, two pure cultures of Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002 (DSM 18807) and T. 
denitrificans  (DSM 12475) were obtained from the ‘Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - German 
collection of microorganisms and cell cultures ’ in Braunschweig (Germany). Prior to this 
study, all the cultures had been used in Fe(II)-based denitrification bioassays (Kiskira et al., 
2017b). 
The basal medium was prepared with the following components (g/L): 2.00 NaHCO 3, 
0.25 NH 4Cl, 0.30 KH 2PO 4, 0.40 K 2H2PO 4, and 0.10 NaCl. The trace mineral solution was 
added from a sterile stock solution as detailed in Weber et al. (2009). The feed Fe(II) and 
NO 3- concentrations were 600 and 120 mg/L, respectively.  
99 
 4.2.2 Preparation of the experiments 
Serum bottles of 125 mL were used for the batch experiments and maintained at room 
temperature (22 ± 2°C). Fe(II) and NO 3- were added in concentration of 600 and 120 mg/L, in 
the form of iron(II) chloride (FeCl 2·4H 2O) and sodium nitrate (NaNO 3), respectively. EDTA 
in a molar ratio of 0.5:1.0 with Fe(II) was used as chelating agent. Cu, Ni and Zn were added  
in concentration of 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/L in the form of copper chloride (CuCl 2), nickel 
chloride (NiCl 2·6H 2O) and zinc chloride (ZnCl 2). All the chemicals were of analytical grade 
(Sigma Aldrich, Germany). 
The feed pH was adjusted to 7.0 by adding NaOH and HCl before flushing the bottles 
with He in order to maintain anoxic conditions. Bicarbonate (2 g/L as NaHCO 3) was added to 
each bottle as pH buffer and inorganic carbon source. Both mixed and pure cultures were 
taken from the liquor of the bioassays of a previous experiment (experiment 4 in Kiskira et 
al., 2017b), which was properly stored at 4°C for 1 month prior to performing the 
experiments of the present study. All the cultures were seeded in the serum bottles in a 10% 
(v/v) amount. The initial volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration was 200, 320, 410 
and 750 mg VSS/L in the bottles inoculated with the Thiobacillus -mixed culture, T. 
denitrificans pure culture, activated sludge enrichment and Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002, 
respectively. Then, the bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps 
and placed on a gyratory shaker at 220 rpm. Microcosms were prepared in duplicate. For 
each microbial culture, controls without electron donors and metals were carried out to 
monitor the removal of NO 3-, which was not associated with chemolithotrophic 
denitrification. Abiotic controls were also performed for possible chemical reactions between 
Fe(II), NO 3- and/or Cu, Ni and Zn.  
 
4.2.3 Thermodynamic modeling of metal speciation in the batch experiments 
Metal speciation was predicted using Visual MINTEQ ver.3.1 (KTH, SEED, 
Sweden), a thermodynamic equilibrium modeling software (http://vminteq.lwr.kth.se/). 
Visual MINTEQ allows for simulating chemical processes, while it is not capable for taking 
into account biological processes (e.g. biodegradation and biosorption). However, the 
modeling by Visual MINTEQ can give important information on the metal speciation based 
on the experimental observations associated with a biological process. In this study, the  
100 
 dissolved and precipitated metal concentrations were simulated for the experiments 
performed with the Thiobacillus mixed culture as well as the abiotic control by using the 
concentrations measured after 4 days of incubation as input data. The simulations were 
performed accounting for  Fe(II) and Fe(III), EDTA, nutrients, trace element concentrations as 
reported in section 2.1, and 40 mg/L of added Cu, Ni and Zn. The temperature was set to 
22°C, the pH was fixed at 6.3 and the oversaturated solids were allowed to precipitate. 
 
4.2.4 Calculations 
Nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation efficiencies were calculated based on the following 
equations: 
ܰ𝑖ݐ𝑟 ݁ݐܽ𝑟݂݂݁ ݈ܽݒ݋݉݁𝑖ܿ𝑖 ݕܿ݊݁[%] =𝐼݊𝑖ݐ𝑖ܱܰ ݈ܽ 3− [݃݉ 𝐿⁄] − 𝐹𝑖ܱܰ ݈ܽ݊ 3− [/݃݉𝐿]

4.2.5 Statistical analysis 
Statistically significant differences between the nitrate removal with and without the 
addition of Cu, Ni and Zn in batch bioassays were determined by one-way ANOVA analysis, 
using the Excel statistical package. The results were considered statistically significant when 
the p-value was below 0.05. 
  
101 
 4.2.6 Sampling and analytical methods  
Ferrous iron, nitrate, nitrite (NO 2-), HMs (Cu, Ni, Zn) and pH were analyzed at t=0, 
after 6 h on day 1 and, subsequently, every 24 h till day 10. Samples were taken with 5-mL 
disposable syringes. The NO 3- and NO 2- concentrations were analyzed by ion 
chromatography (IC) with chemically suppressed conductivity using an ICS-1100 system 
(Thermofisher Scientific, USA) equipped with an AERS 500 Carbonate Electrolytically 
Regenerated Suppressor, 2 mm, an IonPac AG15 - 9 μm pre -column, an IonPac AS15 -9 µm 
column and an AS- DV autosampler. The liquid samples were filtered with 0.22 μm syringe 
cellulose membranes (EMD Millipore, USA) prior to IC analysis. Ferrous iron was quantified 
photometrically by using an UV-1800 240V IVDD UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, 
Japan), following the analytical method with 1,10-phenanthroline reported by Ahoranta et al. 
(2016). Fe(II) determination was performed immediately after the sampling, for avoiding 
chemical Fe(II) oxidation. The filtered samples were acidified using 0.5% HNO 3 and stored 
for analyses of the Cu, Ni and Zn concentrations by inductively coupled plasma optical 
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Optima 8300 Perkin Elmer, USA). The calibrations were 
performed using a multi-element solution (Perkin Elmer, USA) and the selected wavelengths 
were the following: 327, 221 and 206 nm for Cu, Ni, and Zn respectively. VSS were analyzed 
according to the standard methods (APHA, 1992). 
 
4.3 Results and discussion 
4.3.1 Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification efficiency in the absence of metals 
Denitrification coupled to Fe(II) oxidation was initially investigated with Fe(II) as the 
sole electron donor in the absence of Cu, Ni and Zn at the optimal Fe(II):EDTA ratio 0.5:1, 
according to Kiskira et al. (2017b). In all experiments, no nitrite was detected as intermediate 
of denitrification and pH slightly decreased from 7.0 to 6.3. According to Visual MINTEQ, 
the concentrations of non-complexed EDTA were negligible (data not shown), indicating that 
EDTA most probably did not have an inhibitory effect towards microorganisms (Chakraborty 
and Picardal, 2013). 
The use of the Thiobacillus -mixed culture resulted in a complete nitrate removal in 7 
d (Fig. 1), faster than that observed by Kiskira et al. (2017b) in 10 d, and the highest specific 
nitrate removal rate, i.e. 10.4 mg NO 3-/(g VSS·d). However, the specific nitrate removal rate  
102 
 was very similar to that achieved in the previous study due to a 11% higher VSS 
concentration (Table 4.1). 
Fe(II)-based denitrification was also studied with a T. denitrificans  pure culture. The 
specific nitrate removal rate was 4.4 mg NO 3-/(g VSS·d), i.e. approximately 55% lower 
compared to that obtained with the Thiobacillus -mixed culture (Table 1). Nitrate removal 
efficiency reached 91% in 10 d with the T. denitrificans  pure culture (Fig. 1), thus similar to 
that reported by Kiskira et al. (2017b). The specific Fe(II) oxidation rate, i.e. 17.8 mg 
Fe(II)/(g VSS·d), was slightly higher than the 17.0 mg Fe(II)/(g VSS·d) observed in the 
previous study. A similar trend was also observed with the activated sludge enrichment. The 
specific nitrate removal rate was 3.7 mg NO 3-/(g VSS·d) and the specific Fe(II) oxidation rate 
increased from 12.0 to 17.5 mg Fe(II)/(g VSS·d), in comparison with Kiskira et al. (2017b). 
Nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation efficiencies reached up to 96 and 92% respectively, after 
10 d (Fig. 4.1).

The lowest specific nitrate removal rate of 2.8 mg NO 3-/(g VSS·d) was observed in 
the bioassays with the Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002. However, the specific Fe(II) oxidation 
rate significantly increased from 5.6 to 13.9 mg Fe(II)/(g VSS·d), comparing to what 
obtained by Kiskira et al. (2017b). Complete nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation were 
observed in 7 d (Fig. 4.1), indicating that the Pseudogulbenkiania  strain was significantly 
enriched in comparison to the previous study, where a complete nitrate removal occurred in 
10 d and only 53% of Fe(II) oxidation was recorded. 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification proceeded in a good agreement with the 
stoichiometry when the Thiobacillus -mixed culture and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain were used. 
The molar Fe(II):NO 3- ratio was in the range 4.5-5.6, thus very similar to the theoretical value 
of 5.0 (Sorensen, 1987). A slightly higher molar Fe(II):NO 3- ratio up to 6.5 was observed 
during the experiments with the T. denitrificans  pure culture  and activated sludge enrichment, 
indicating that part of the Fe(II) oxidized was not associated with denitrification. Visual 
MINTEQ confirmed that part of the added Fe(II) (i.e. approximately 39%) precipitated as 
siderite and vivianite and was not used for denitrification (Table 4.2). 
In comparison with the classical heterotrophic denitrification and the sulfur-driven 
autotrophic denitrification, Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification remains a less efficient 
technology, as it results in lower nitrate removal rates (Di Capua et al., 2015). Research 
efforts are required in order to optimize the process by further enriching the microbial 
cultures on Fe(II) or using continuous-flow conditions, which can enhance denitrification 
efficiencies and rates (Zhang et al., 2015). 
4.3.2. Influence of heavy metals on Fe( II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification  
4.3.2.1 Speciation and fate of Cu, Ni and Zn 
This study also evaluated the efficiency and rates of nitrate removal during Fe(II)-
mediated autotrophic denitrification in the presence of Cu, Ni and Zn in batch experiments. A 
decrease of the soluble Cu, Ni and Zn concentration occurred in the first 4 d in all the 
experiments (Fig. 4.2), likely due to metal precipitation, co-precipitation, sorption onto iron 
(hydr)oxides, and probably sorption onto biomass (Crane at al., 2010; Kiskira et al., 2017a). 
The decrease was in the range 23-59% in the bottles with Zn and Cu, whereas the soluble Ni 
concentration decreased in the range 37-59%. 
  
106 
  
Figure 4.2 : Soluble Cu, Ni, Zn profiles using the four microbial cultures with initial Cu , Ni and Zn concentrations of 5 (x), 
10 (●), 20 (▲) and 40 (■) mg/L. Standard deviations are in the range 0 .1-6.6 mg/L. 
 
 
In agreement, the simulations performed with Visual MINTEQ indicated that 
approximately half of the added amount of Cu, Ni and Zn (40 mg/L) precipitated when the 
Thiobacillus -mixed culture was used (Table 4.2). The same simulations were obtained with 
the other microbial cultures (data not shown). The results of the simulation performed 
without accounting for the biomass at initial 40 mg Cu/L showed that the amount of 
precipitated Cu was only 4 mg/L (Table 4.2), i.e. 80% lower than that observed in the 
samples with the biomass. At the same time, the precipitated Fe(III) was only 3 mg/L (Table 
4.2), in comparison with the 52 mg Fe(III)/L obtained with the Thiobacillus  dominated mixed 
culture. This indicates that the biological Fe(II) oxidation resulted in a higher production of 
Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, with precipitation of Cu (as copper phosphate, copper carbonate or 
copper oxide) being the main mechanism for Cu removal according to Visual MINTEQ. 
However, also biosorption and copper co-precipitation with iron oxides most likely 
contributed to the decrease of soluble Cu, but Visual MINTEQ could not account for such 
removal processes. Similar results were obtained with Ni and Zn (Table 4.2). Further 
investigation is needed in order to distinguish among the different ongoing mechanisms 
responsible for the decrease of soluble Cu, Ni and Zn concentrations. 
 
In this line, analytical methods such as X-ray absorption and Fourier transform infra-
red spectroscopy as well as flow cytometry techniques can help to evaluate the effect of 
heavy metal aqueous species on the microbial cell structure and the tolerance of the cells to 
heavy metal toxicity (Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2018). However, this was beyond the scope of 
the present study. 
4.3.2.2 Nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation with Cu, Ni and Zn 
Fig. 4.3 shows the nitrate removal efficiency (%) achieved after 10 d in the bioassays 
inoculated with the four microbial cultures at different initial metal concentrations. All metals 
negatively affected denitrification, whereas no stimulation was observed even at the lowest 
Cu, Ni and Zn concentrations (Table 4.1). 
The addition of Cu, Ni and Zn at the highest initial concentration of 40 mg/L resulted 
in 3.0, 1.5 and 1.6 times lower nitrate removal efficiencies (p-value of 0.0001, 0.0010 and 
0.0006), respectively, than those obtained without metals for the Thiobacillus -dominated 
mixed culture. Fe(II) oxidation efficiency decreased by 80% when 40 mg Cu/L was fed, and  
approximately 55% at the highest Ni and Zn concentrations with the Thiobacillus -dominated 
mixed culture. A statistically significant decrease was also observed with the activated sludge 
enrichment, as 2.0, 1.4, and 1.7 times lower specific nitrate removal efficiencies (p-value of 
0.001, 0.005 and 0.003) were obtained with 40 mg/L of Cu, Ni and Zn, respectively. Fe(II) 
oxidation efficiency was approximately 40% lower in the experiments with the activated 
sludge, in comparison with the Thiobacillus  mixed culture. 
In this study, Cu was observed to be the most inhibitory metal. This is in agreement 
with the work of Principi et al. (2006), who reported that Cu had the greatest toxic effect on 
an activated sludge, in experiments performed with 0.5-1.0 mg Cu/L, 0.8-5.2 mg Ni/L and 
0.8-7.1 mg Zn/L. Higher Cu, Ni and Zn concentrations were used in the current study, 
indicating that the activated sludge was likely more tolerant to HMs toxicity, resulting in a 
higher denitrification activity. 
In comparison with the Thiobacillus -mixed culture, a significantly higher sensitivity 
to metal toxicity was observed for the T. denitrificans  pure culture at 40 mg/L of Cu, Ni and 
Zn (p-value of 0.0348, 0.0132 and 0.0365). The specific nitrate removal rates were 1.4, 2.5 
and 2.3 mg NO 3-/(g VSS·d) (Table 1), i.e. 69, 43 and 47% (p-value of 0.0006, 0.0021 and 
0.0022) lower than those achieved in the absence of metals. The addition of 40 mg Cu/L  
108 
 resulted in a 68% slower Fe(II) oxidation, whereas a 41 and 45% decrease of the specific 
Fe(II) oxidation rate was observed with the addition of Ni and Zn.

Cu (A), Ni (B) and Zn (C) initial concentrations with the Thiobacillus-dominated m ixed culture (TM), activated sludge 
enrichment (AS), and two pure cultures of T. denitrificans (TDP) and Pseud ogulbenkiania sp. 2002 (PG). 
 
 
109 
 Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002 is a member of the family Nesseriaceae  (Weber et al., 
2006), which participates in the metal biogeochemical cycles. Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002 
has been used for the co-precipitation of HMs with biogenic Fe(III) oxides (Weber et al., 
2009). However, in this study Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002 resulted in the lowest Fe(II) 
mediated autotrophic denitrification efficiency when Cu, Ni and Zn were supplemented. 
Nitrate removal efficiency only reached 6, 8 and 6% (Fig. 4.3) when 40 mg/L of Cu, Ni and 
Zn, respectively, was used, in comparison with the complete NO 3- removal achieved in the 
absence of metals (p-value of 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0002). A high negative impact was observed 
even at an initial metal concentration of 5 mg/L, with denitrification that was inhibited by 17, 
25 and 17% (Table 4.1) in the presence of Cu, Ni and Zn, respectively (p-value of 0.0022, 
0.0024 and 0.0086). Up to now, only one study has been carried out on the influence of 
metals on the activity of Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002, with the aim of investigating As 
immobilization onto biogenic Fe oxyhydroxides under different initial molar Fe/As ratios 
(Xiu et al., 2016). Nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation efficiencies were not inhibited with an 
initial concentration of approximately 1 mg As/L, and the process efficiently resulted in the 
immobilization of As mainly onto biogenic lepidocrocite crystals. 
 
4.3.2.2.1. Effect of Cu 
Cu inhibited all the denitrifying cultures, in the range of initial 10-40 mg Cu/L, with 
the two pure cultures being more sensitive to Cu toxicity (Fig. 4.4). An initial concentration 
of 20-40 mg Cu/L resulted in a 73-94% and 54-71% inhibition of the Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 
2002 and T. denitrificans activity, respectively. A lower inhibition was observed at the initial 
concentration of 5 and 10 mg Cu/L, with the denitrifying activity of Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 
2002 and T. denitrificans being repressed by 17-36% (p-value of 0.0024 and 0.0032) and 9-
26% (p-value of 0.0025 and 0.2023), respectively. 
Denitrification was inhibited by 66% when Cu was supplemented at 40 mg Cu/L 
(soluble 19.7 mg Cu/L after 4 d) when the Thiobacillus -dominated mixed culture was used. 
Nitrate removal efficiency was 51, 30 and 15% lower (p-value of 0.000009, 0.0030 and 
0.0160) at initial Cu concentrations of 20, 10 and 5 mg Cu/L (soluble 9.6, 6.7 and 3.1 mg 
Cu/L), respectively, than that obtained without supplementing Cu.  
110 
  
Figure 4.4: NO 3- and Fe(II) profiles at initial 5 (x), 10 (●), 20 (▲) and 40 (■) mg Cu/L using the  Thiobacillus -dominated 
mixed culture (TM), activated sludge enrichment (AS), T. denitrificans (TDP ), and Pseudogulbenkiania sp. 2002 (PG) pure 
cultures. Standard deviations are in the range 0.1-25.0 mg/L. 
 
 
The activated sludge enrichment better tolerated Cu, resulting in a 46% inhibition at 
the feed concentration of 40 mg Cu/L (soluble 17.1 mg Cu/L). The inhibition was 33, 23 and 
only 4%, when Cu was fed at the initial concentrations of 20, 10 and 5 mg Cu/L (soluble 8.7 , 
6.5 and 3.0 mg Cu/L), respectively. The addition of 5 mg Cu/L did not result in a statistically 
significant nitrate removal decrease (p-value of 0.1754), which was instead observed at 10 
and 20 mg Cu/L (p-value of 0.0091 and 0.0035). Ochoa-Herrera et al. (2011) reported a 
 
111 
 similar inhibition of nitrate removal (i.e. 50%) by Cu on denitrifiers originating from a 
methanogenic granular sludge at a soluble Cu concentration of approximately 1 mg Cu/L . 
However, the authors demonstrated that the inhibitory impact of Cu on denitrifying bacteria 
decreased with the exposure time. In agreement with Ochoa-Herrera et al. (2011), Zou et al. 
(2013) observed that the supplementation of Cu to denitrifying mixed cultures enriched on 
ethanol led to a 48% slower nitrate removal at a soluble Cu concentration of 0.7 mg Cu/L. In 
another study, Sakadevan et al. (1999) demonstrated that denitrification in soil was inhibited 
starting from Cu concentrations higher than 80 mg Cu/L. 
 
4.3.2.2.2 Effect of Ni 
Fig. 4.5 shows NO 3- removal and Fe(II) oxidation at different initial Ni concentrations 
with all the microbial cultures investigated. Ni showed a lower inhibitory effect than Cu. 
Nickel has been indeed reported as an essential trace element in the chemolithotrophic 
growth of microorganisms, as Ni catalyzes the synthesis of hydrogenase and is a constituent 
of the hydrogenase in the cytoplasmic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and in the 
membrane-bound forms (Gikas, 2008). 
The activated sludge enrichment resulted only in a 0-5% inhibition at initial 
concentrations of 5, 10 and 20 mg Ni/L, corresponding to 2.1, 7.7 and 11.2 mg /L of soluble 
Ni (p-value of 0.7973, 0.3761 and 0.0610). A 30% inhibition (p-value of 0.005) of 
denitrification was observed at a feed concentration of 40 mg Ni/L (soluble 24.6 mg Ni/L). 
Different results can be found in the scientific literature, mainly due to the diverse times of 
exposure to Ni, operating conditions (batch or continuous-flow) or biomass agglomerates 
(suspended cultures or biofilms) used. For instance, Gikas (2008) reported that concentrations 
of about 5 mg Ni/L enhanced the activity of denitrifying microorganisms in an activated 
sludge, whereas Ni started to inhibit the microbial growth at concentrations higher than 10 
mg Ni/L. In another study, Ni concentrations up to 27 mg Ni/L stimulated the microbial 
growth, while inhibition started at higher concentrations until no growth was any longer 
reported when the feed Ni concentration was 160 mg Ni/L (Gikas, 2007). In the current 
study, no stimulation was observed even at a feed concentration of 5 mg Ni/L. Similarly, Ong 
et al. (2004) reported inhibition of the denitrifying activity of an activated sludge at Ni 
concentrations up to 10 mg Ni/L.  
  
112 
  
Figure 4.5: NO 3- and Fe(II) profiles at initial 5 (x), 10 (●), 20 (▲) and 40 (■) mg Ni/L using  the Thiobacillus -dominated 
mixed culture (TM), activated sludge enrichment (AS), T. denitrificans (TDP ), and Pseudogulbenkiania sp. 2002 (PG) pure 
cultures. Standard deviations are in the range 0.2-28.7 mg/L. 
 
Zou et al. (2014) observed that a concentration of 10 mg Ni/L did not repress 
denitrification of a biofilm grown onto activated carbon, originated from an activated sludge 
and being mainly composed by Dechloromonas  denitrifican s and Hydrogenophaga caeni  
after a long-time enrichment on ethanol. However, the nitrate removal rate decreased by 18 
and 65% when Ni was fed at 50 and 100 mg Ni/L, respectively (Zou et al., 2014). In anoth er 
study, Zou et al. (2015) reported that fluidized-bed denitrifying biofilms tolerated soluble Ni 
 
113 
 concentrations up to 500 mg Ni/L, due to the enhanced tolerance of denitrifiers to Ni after 
approximately 250 d of incubation in continuous-flow fluidized-bed reactors (FBRs). 
A low inhibition in the range 0-10 % was also observed for the Thiobacillus -mixed 
culture at initial concentrations from 5 to 20 mg Ni/L (soluble concentrations ranging from 
2.3 to 11.0 mg Ni/L). The nitrate removal decrease at feed 10 and 20 mg Ni/L was 
statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.0003 and 0.0121, respectively. Similarly to the 
activated sludge enrichment, a 34% inhibition (p-value of 0.0196) of denitrification was 
observed at a feed concentration of 40 mg Ni/L (soluble 22.6 mg Ni/L). 
An initial concentration of 5 mg Ni/L resulted in a 5% higher nitrate removal 
efficiency with the pure culture of T. denitrificans  (Fig. 3), but the difference was not 
statistically significant (p-value 0.1419) to prove a stimulation of denitrification. At feed Ni 
of 10, 20 and 40 mg Ni/L, the T. denitrificans  pure culture was significantly more affected, 
with the nitrate removal efficiency decreasing by 13, 30 and 43% (p-value of 0.0048, 0.0055 
and 0.0020) compared to that obtained without metals. Di Capua et al. (2017) studied the 
inhibition by Ni on a T. denitrificans  culture enriched on thiosulfate in FBRs. The authors 
reported that Ni concentrations from 25 to 100 mg Ni/L inhibited the thiosulfate-driven 
autotrophic denitrification by only 9-19% in batch bioassays. The higher tolerance to Ni of 
the denitrifying FBR cultures observed by Di Capua et al. (2017) was likely due to the use o f 
completely developed biofilms that protected the cells from the inhibitory effects of Ni. 
Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002 was highly affected by the presence of Ni, as only 8% 
of nitrate removal was observed in the batch assays when Ni was fed at 40 mg Ni/L (soluble 
19.9 mg Ni/L after 4 d). Denitrification was repressed by 38, 31 and 25% at initial 
concentrations of 20, 10 and 5 mg Ni/L (p-value of 0.00008, 0.0037 and 0.0029), 
respectively. 
4.3.2.2.3 Effect of Zn 
The nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation efficiencies achieved in the presence of Zn at 
initial concentrations of 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg Zn/L are reported in Fig. 4.6. When Zn was 
supplemented at a feed concentration of 5, 10 and 20 mg Zn/L, an inhibition of nitrate 
removal by 6-17% (p-value of 0.0108, 0.0028 and 0.0013) and 4-17% (p-value of 0.1280, 
0.0596 and 0.0213) was observed for the Thiobacillus -mixed culture and the activated sludge 
enrichment, respectively.

Figure 4.6: NO 3- and Fe(II) profiles at initial 5 (x), 10 (●), 20 (▲) and 40 (■) mg Zn/L usin g the Thiobacillus -dominated

cultures. Standard deviations are in the range 0.1-21.9 mg/L. 
 
A higher inhibition was observed for the two pure cultures. An initial concentration of 
40 mg Zn/L, which corresponded to soluble 17.8 and 18.7 mg Zn/L with the 
Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002 and the T. denitrificans pure cultures, resulted in a 6 and 49% 
nitrate removal efficiency, respectively. At feed concentrations of 5, 10 and 20 mg Zn/L, the 
inhibition of nitrate removal was in the range 17-50 and 9-26% for the Pseudogulbenkiania  
sp. 2002 and the T. denitrificans  pure culture, respectively. The nitrate removal decrease due 
to the presence of Zn was statistically significant at all Zn concentrations for both the pure 
cultures. 
 
115 
 Sakadevan et al. (1999) reported that the addition of approximately 100 mg Zn per kg 
of sediment led to a stimulation of denitrification by 4%. In contrast, increasing the Zn 
concentration up to 300 mg/kg, a significant decrease of the denitrification rate was observed. 
In agreement with the present study, Feng et al. (2013) reported that the denitrification rate of 
a microbial community in an anoxic-membrane bioreactor decreased by 20-34% at a Zn 
concentration of 3.7-32.3 mg Zn/L, in the simultaneous presence of copper, lead, and 
cadmium. 
 
4.4 Conclusions 
The activity of the four Fe(II)-oxidizing denitrifying cultures was differently affecte d 
by the presence of Cu, Ni and Zn. Metal precipitation, co-precipitation, sorption onto iron 
(hydr)oxides and possible biosorption occurred, as the soluble Cu, Ni and Zn concentrations 
decreased up to 50% after 4 d. The Thiobacillus -dominated mixed culture and activated 
sludge enrichment better tolerated the presence of metals. In contrast, a significantly higher 
sensitivity to metal toxicity was observed for the pure cultures. The use of 
Pseudogulbenkiania  sp. 2002 only resulted in a 6, 8 and 6% nitrate removal efficiency, when 
Cu, Ni and Zn were fed at 40 mg/L, respectively. Among the three HMs, Cu averagely led to 
the highest inhibition of denitrification.

CHAPTER 5 
 
Mineral characterization of the 
Fe(III)(hydr)oxides during Fe(II)-driven 
denitrification 
   
121 
 5.1 Introduction 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification is a promising biotechnology to be 
employed for iron recovery when nitrogen and metal contamination coexists (Papirio et al., 
2014; Zou et al., 2015; Kiskira et al., 2017a,b). Chemoautotrophic denitrifiers are capable of 
coupling Fe(II) oxidation with denitrification resulting in the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen 
gas and the production of Fe(III) precipitates that can be subsequently removed and 
recovered (Kiskira et al., 2017a). 
Many studies reported different biogenic Fe(III)(hydro)oxide mineral phases such as 
goethite, lepidocrocite, hematite, magnetite, maghemite, 2-line ferrihydrite and mixed-phase 
Fe(II)-Fe(III) minerals (green rust) (Senko et al., 2005a, b; Weber et al., 2006; Konhauser et 
al., 2011). Kiskira et al. (2017a) reviewed all biogenic Fe(III)(hydr)oxide products deriving 
from Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic and mixotrophic denitrification. 
The use of different microorganisms results in diverse biogenic Fe(III) 
(oxyhydr)oxides minerals from soluble Fe(II) (Posth et al., 2014). Other factors affecting the 
formation of Fe(III) precipitates are the medium composition, the concentration of possible 
co-substrates, the incubation conditions, metabolic rates and the presence of nucleation sites 
(Kappler and Straub, 2005; Senko et al., 2005a; Larese-Casanova et al., 2010; Pantke et al., 
2012). A slower Fe(II) oxidation produces crystalline minerals, such as goethite, while a 
rapid Fe(II) oxidation leads to the formation of more amorphous phases such as ferrihydrite 
(Lack et al., 2002; Senko et al., 2005b). pH is another factor that affects the formation and 
composition of Fe(III) precipitates. Goethite was reported at pH 7.7, while lepidocrocite at 
pH 6.3 by Acidovorax  sp. BoFeN1 (Larese-Casanova et al., 2010). 
Hennebel at al. (2009) reported that biogenic oxides are more effic ient for heavy 
metal adsorption than chemically produced oxides, due to their larger specific surface area 
and higher binding energy. Arsenic has been reported to co-precipitate with the biogenic 
Fe(III) minerals (Senn and Hemond, 2002; Hohmann et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2009; Ahoranta 
et al., 2016). Microbial oxidation of As(III) and Fe(II) linked to denitrification resulted in an 
enhanced immobilization of As(V) onto biogenic Fe(III) (hydr)oxides in sand-packed bed 
columns (Sun et al., 2009). Furthermore, arsenic immobilization by biogenic goethite and 
lepidocrocite has also been reported (Hohmann et al., 2009; Xiu et al., 2016). 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification has been usefully applied in recovery of 
co-precipitated or absorbed heavy metals (Finneran et al., 2002; Hohmann et al., 2009; Xiu et 
al. 2016). Pantke et al. (2012) reported that green rust is a highly reactive iron mineral and  
122 
 can be used for the recovery of chromium and arsenic. Furthermore, Fe(III) oxides can be 
recycled and used for phosphorus removal (Nielsen and Nielsen, 1998; Zhang et al., 2015a).  
Moreover, Fe(II)-driven denitrification leads to either encrusted or non-encrusted 
biominerals. Some studies reported that crust was formed around the cells during the 
autotrophic and mixotrophic growth (Kappler et al., 2005; Posth et al., 2014). Conversely, 
when supplementing chelating agents (i.e. EDTA) Fe(III) mineral encrustation is prevented 
(Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013).  
The evaluation of the particular Fe(III) precipitates formed is crucial in order to 
decide the adoption of the “reuse strategy ” and the possible applications. Some of the major 
applications are pigments for paints and the construction industry, magnetic pigments and 
ferrites, catalysts for industrial syntheses, adsorbents for water and gas purification and for 
low level radioactive waste decontamination, production of photochemicals and fertilizers 
(Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003).  
The objectives of this work were to characterize the Fe(III) oxides by different 
mineral characterization methods, i.e. X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Raman spectroscopy, 
scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-Ray Analyser (SEM-EDX) 
and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). 
 
5.2 Materials and methods 
5.2.1 Sources of microorganisms and mineral growth media 
Microorganisms and mineral media were as previously described (see sections 3.2.1 
and 4.2.1). 
 
5.2.2 Sampling and analytical methods  
Mineral characterization of the Fe(III) precipitates formed during Fe(II)-mediated 
autotrophic denitrification was performed on: i) four samples obtained in the absence of 
metals, with the use of a Thiobacillus -dominated mixed culture (TMp), a T. denitrificans  
(TDPp), an activated sludge enrichment (ASp) and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 (PGp); ii) 
twelve samples obtained in the experiments with Cu (TMCp, TDPCp, ASCp, PGCp), Ni 
(TMNp, TDPNp, ASNp, PGNp) and Zn (TMZp, TDPZp, ASZp, PGZp). Furthermore, the 
characterization of the precipitates in abiotic controls (ACp) was also performed.  
123 
 Fe(III) oxides were pasteurized (80°C for 10 min), collected by centrifugation under 
anaerobic conditions, and washed twice with a NaHCO 3 buffer (pH 6.8) as previously 
described (Weber et al., 2001). Then, the precipitates were washed several times with double-
distilled water by centrifugation, in order to remove the impurity ions associated with the 
procedure, as described in Cornell and Schwertmann (2003). Finally, the samples were dried 
at 40°C for 48 h prior to analysis. 
The samples were firstly analyzed by using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) with a Niton 
XL3t GOLDD + XRF analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The solid samples were 
also examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to obtain the morphology 
information. The microscope was a Vega 3 (TESCAN, Czech Republic), equipped with an 
energy dispersive QUANTAX X-Ray Analyser (EDX) (Bruker, Czech Republic) for 
chemical analysis. Elemental identification and quantitative compositional analysis were 
performed by XRF and, in some cases, were supported by SEM-EDX. SEM microscopy was 
used to determine crystal size, morphology and domain character that could be directly 
odserved. 
 FTIR spectra were recorded with an IRAffinity-1 Fourier transformation infrared 
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan), equipped with a deuterated-triglycine sulfate (DTGS) 
detector using a wavelength between 400 – 7000 cm-1. Prior to being analyzed with FTIR, the 
samples were transformed into pellets (diameter 7 mm) by using potassium bromide (KBr). 
Infrared spectra were obtained through the interaction of iron oxides with electromagnetic 
radiation. FTIR was used to obtain a rapid and useful identification of Fe(III) precipitates and 
information about crystal morphology, degree of crystallinity and the extent of metal 
substitution (Gotic and Music, 2006). Furthermore, with FTIR spectroscopy, information 
about the adsorbed molecules and the nature of surface complexes can be obtained (Cornell 
and Schwertmann, 2003). Impurities that can produce distinct bands such as 1400 cm-1 of 
nitrate and even traces of 1-2% of goethite in a sample of hematite can be identified by FTIR 
(Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). Broadening of the absorption bands reflects a decrease in 
crystal perfection (Cambier, 1986). Structural substitution of other elements such as Al, Mn 
and Cr causes a shift in the positions of the bands (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003).  
Raman measurements were carried out on a Renishaw INVIA spectrometer equipped 
with a microscope and a CCD detector (LGE, France). A 532 nm solid-state green (Nd:YAG) 
laser was used with a maxim um power of 50 mW. The acquisitions were performed through a 
Leica (x100) magnification objective after achieving a calibration on a silicon standard. The  
124 
 Rayleigh scattering component was removed by an Edge filter, and the Raman-scattered light 
was dispersed by a holographic grating with 1800 lines/mm. The integration time was set at 
60 s. Raman provided complementary information to that from infrared spectra (Cornell and 
Schwertmann, 2003) as Raman spectroscopy is an easy and fast method for the identification 
of different iron oxides, hydroxides and oxyhydroxides (Hanesch, 2009). This method can be 
used when a material is poorly crystallized which often occurs in bioprocesses (Hanesch, 
2009). The spectra of the samples measured in this study were displayed and compared to 
those reported in the literature. An overview of the bands measured for various iron minerals 
was given by Cornell and Schwertmann (2003). 
 
5.3 Results 
Table 5.1 reports the FTIR and Raman bands that are defined as diagnostic for 
individual Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. However, in this study, a mixture of Fe(III)(hydr)oxides was 
identified in each sample. The different Fe(III) (hydr)oxides had similar FTIR and Raman 
spectroscopy bands. Furthermore, many impurities and different minerals apart from Fe(III) 
(hydr)oxides were present.  
 
5.3.1 Color 
An e ye-catching color method was used for an easy and fast identification of the iron 
oxides (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). When the activated sludge enrichment was used, 
the liquid phase turned into reddish and brownish color at the end of the experiments. In the 
bottles with the Thiobacillus -mixed culture, the color was more red than brown. 
T.denitrificans  and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 resulted in a darker reddish brown or 
even black color. White, grey and reddish precipitates were observed in abiotic controls. In 
this study, the addition of Cu resulted in a red to brown liquid phase and a browner liquid 
phase was observed with the addition of Ni and Zn.

The color of Fe(III)(hydr)oxides observed by naked eye is reported in Table 5.1. 
However, Fe(III) precipitates consisted of a mixture of (hydr)oxides with many impurities 
and the color identification was thus not reliable. When transformed into a powder, the 
precipitates showed a different color, which is reported in Table 5.2. In Fig. 5.1, an example 
of the color of the ACp and TDPp precipitates is shown.

 5.3.2 Mineralogy 
5.3.2.1 FTIR and Raman spectroscopy for the samples formed in the absence of metals 
FTIR and Raman spectra of the samples showed similar bands. Raman spectra of 
some characteristic bands are shown in Fig. 5.2. All spectra showed a band at around 1000 
cm-1, indicating the presence of siderite (iron carbonate mineral: FeCO 3) (Figure 5.2 b, c). 
Some spectra also showed a band at around 150-200 cm-1 (Fig. 5.2b). Figure 5.2a shows a 
typical 2-line ferrihydrite (Hanesch, 2009) of a dark spot in the sample PGNp.  
The infrared spectrum of the precipitates in the abiotic controls (ACp) showed strong 
bands at 3380, 1630, 1049 and 540 cm-1 and a weak band at 470 cm-1 (Fig. 5.3). The bands at 
540, 470 and 3380 cm-1 are diagnostic for hematite. The FTIR band at 1630 and 1050 cm-1 
was probably due to the formation of goethite or akaganeite. Dark and red spots (diameter 
~10 μm) were observed with the microscope equipped in Raman spectroscopy instrument. 
The Raman spectra of the dark spots showed bands at 225, 290-300, 412 and 611 cm-1 that 
are diagnostic for hematite (Fig. 5.2b). Furthermore, because of the red spots, a band a t 1321 
cm-1 was also observed, corresponding to hematite. No goethite or akaganeite bands were 
observed in Raman spectra.  
The infrared spectrum of the precipitates with Thiobacillus-mixed culture showed the 
same bands of those obtained in the abiotic controls, with the only exception that the band of 
hematite at 470 cm-1 was not observed. Furthermore, strong bands at 1630 and 1050 cm-1 
most likely corresponded to akaganeite, as confirmed by the two broad bands at 700 and ca. 
400 cm-1 obtained for the red spots in Raman spectra (diameter 3 μm). Dark and red spots of 
TMp were smaller than in abiotic controls (Fig.5.4). The dark spots (with a diameter of 
approximately 2.5 μm) corresponded to hematite as the combination of bands 225, 290-300 
and 412 cm-1 was observed. Additional strong bands at 120 and 1050 cm-1 were likely due to 
the presence of impurities. Another possibility is that the band might have been at around 700 
cm-1, due to ferrihydrite. Furthermore, some more white spots were detected in the sample. 
The bands were similar to the bands of the red spots, however the band at 400 cm-1 was more 
intense. 
The same FTIR bands were observed when the T. denitrificans  pure culture (TDPp) 
was used. Similarly, Raman spectra of the dark spots (approximately diameter 5 μm) showed 
bands at 225, 290-300, 412 cm-1 and, additionally, at 611 cm-1, with all the bands 
corresponding to hematite. However, Raman spectra of the red spots (diameter  ̴ 5μ m)  
127 
 identified bands at 700 and 1600 cm-1 that possibly corresponded to maghemite. However, 
the band at 700 cm-1 could also represent two-line ferrihydrite. The additional bands at 1400 
and 2360 cm-1 were impurities.

Figure 5.3 : FTIR spectra of the precipitate obtained during the abiotic controls 
 
 
The FTIR spectrum of ASp samples collected from activated sludge bottles showed 
bands at 540, 1050, 1630 and 3380 cm-1, as the previous samples that corresponded to 
hematite. The Raman spectra of dark spots confirmed the presence of hematite. Additionally, 
bands at 1300 and 1600 cm-1 in dark and red spots might correspond to maghemite and/or 
magnetite. The Raman spectrum of white spots showed bands at 350, 500, 700 and 1300 cm-
1. However, the bands at 3740 and 3725 cm-1, corresponding to OH groups of maghemite 
were not recorded. Most possibly, the spectrum was therefore a mixture of magnetite and 
maghemite. The broad band from 653 to 750 cm-1 was caused by both minerals. The 
maghemite band above 1300 cm-1 was relatively weak compared to the other bands, probably 
due to the presence of magnetite. However, the red spots might also have contained six-line 
or two-line ferrihydrite, corresponding to the three bands observed at 350, 500 and 700 cm-1. 
Similarly, sample PGp from the bottles inoculated with Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 
2002 showed the same FTIR bands of hematite, such as the Raman spectra of the dark spots.

 As in previous samples, an additional band at 1600 cm-1 might indicate the presence of 
maghemit e.

 5.3.2.2 FTIR and Raman spectroscopy of the precipitate s formed in the presence of 
metals 
Addition of Cu 
The infrared spectrum of the precipitates obtained with the Thiobacillus -mixed culture 
in the presence of Cu (TMCp) showed the bands at 1050 cm-1 and 1630 cm-1, corresponding 
to akaganeite. The addition of Cu resulted in a broad band at 3448 cm-1, likely corresponded 
to the 3480+3390 (doublet) (OH and H 2O stretch) of akaganeite, as also confirmed by the 
additional band at around 500 cm-1 that was due to the Fe-O stretch of akaganeite. The weak 
bands at 470 and 540 cm-1 likely correspond ed to hematite. Besides, a strong band at around 
1400 cm-1 correspond ed to nitrate. Raman spectrum of the dark, red and white spots showed 
the same bands as in the TMp precipitates. TMCp was most likely a mixture of hematite and 
akaganeite as TMp. 
As observed using the Thiobacillus -mixed culture, the mineralogy of the precipitates 
was not considerably affected by the presence of Cu when the T. denitrificans  pure culture 
was used. The infrared spectrum showed the same bands of the TDPp sample, despite another 
band of hematite at 470 instead of 540 cm-1 was recorded in the TDPCp sample. The Raman 
bands at 225, 412 and 1321 cm-1 corresponded to hematite and additional band at 700 cm-1 
probably indicated the presence of two-line ferrihydrite. The Raman spectra of TDPp samples 
showed band of maghemite at 1600 cm-1, which, however, was not identified with the 
addition of Cu. The bands at 700 and 1330 cm-1 were likely due to maghemite, in agreement 
with what was observed in sample TDPp. 
Similar ly, ASCp sample collected from activated sludge bottles in the presence of Cu 
in the liquid phase showed the same FTIR bands as for TMCp. Hematite, maghemite and/or 
magnetite and/or two-line ferrihydrite were identified from the Raman spectra. PGCp sample 
confirmed that the addition of Cu resulted in same Fe(III) (hydr)oxides of the precipitates in 
the absence of metals. 
 
Addition of Ni  
Infrared spectrum obtained from the sample of the bottles inoculated with 
Thiobacillus-mixed culture in the presence of Ni (TMNp) showed some additional FTIR 
peaks at 3430, 940, 650 and 450 cm-1, corresponding to ferrihydrite. As in previous samples, 
a strong band at 1630 cm-1, might correspond to akaganeite; however, the band at 1050 cm-1  
131 
 was not observed. In contrast, none of the FTIR bands of hematite were recorded in TMNp 
sample. The Raman spectrum of the dark spots showed the same bands similarly to previous 
samples, corresponding most possibly to hematite. Red spots might be either akaganeite or 
ferrihydrite as bands at about 400 and 700 cm-1 were recorded. However, the additional broad 
band of either maghemite or hematite at about 1300 cm-1 was recorded. Similar ly, the 
TDPNp, ASNp and PGNp samples showed the bands reported in Table 5.2 and described in 
section 5.3.2.2. 
 
Addition of Zn  
FTIR spectrum of the sample that was taken from bottles inoculated with 
Thiobacillus -mixed culture in the presence of Zn (TMZ) showed a mixture of ferrihydrite and 
akaganeite. The FTIR band at 3430 cm-1 and the broad band at 940 cm-1 of ferrihydrite were 
observed. The bands at 1630 cm-1, 410 and 1050 cm-1 corresponding to akaganeite were 
recorded. Furthermore, an additional band at 1384 cm-1 was observed. Hematite among the 
FTIR bands was not confirmed. Dark, red and orange spots were observed by Raman 
spectroscopy, however as in TMNp sample, the dark spots had similar peaks with the red 
spots. As described above, red spots could be akaganeite or ferrihydrite or a mixture of  them, 
in agreement with the FTIR analysis results. In addition, in this sample, orange spots were 
observed, which might correspond to hematite, as hematite peaks at 225, 245, 411 and 1321 
cm-1 were visible. The bands of TDPZp, ASZp and PGZp are reported in Table 5.2.  
 
5.3.3 Elemental identification and quantitative compositional analysis by XRF and 
SEM-EDX 
The precipitates obtained in the experiments with Cu, Ni, Zn indicat ed absorption 
and/or co-precipitation with Fe(III)(hydr)oxides. Table 5.3 reports Fe oxides amount (%) in 
each sample. The use of Thiobacillus -mixed culture and chemical oxidation resulted in 61% 
of Fe(III) oxides in the sample. A slightly lower percentage of 57 and 55% was observed 
when the T. denitrificans  mixed culture and the activated sludge enrichment were used, 
respectively. The use of Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 resulted in 50% of Fe(III) oxides in 
the precipitate. When Cu was supplemented, a higher amount of Fe(III) oxides by 20 and 
15% was obtained with the T. denitrificans  and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 pure 
cultures, respectively, whereas a decrease by 14 and 13% was observed in the samples with  
132 
 the Thiobacillus -mixed culture and activated sludge enrichment. The addition of Ni resulted 
in an increase of the Fe(III) oxides formation in the range of 5-20% in all the samples. The 
precipitates in the bottles with Zn had a lower amount of Fe oxides by 6 and 2% with the 
Thiobacillus -mixed culture and the Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002, respectively, whereas an 
increase by 22 and 9% was observed in bottles with activated sludge and the T. denitrificans  
pure culture.

5.3.4. Microscopy 
Samples were observed with the microscope equipped in Raman spectroscopy 
instrument. None of the samples was homogeneous. A mixture of several spots (dark, white, 
red and orange) in microscale was observed (Fig. 5.4). As the spot sizes were mostly small in 
a variety in the range 100 nm - 10 μm, several spots on each sample were measured to avoid 
the measurement of a small impurity instead of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. Two samples, i.e. TMp 
and TDPp, were inspected by SEM, which revealed varying sizes and geometrical shapes. 
Fig. 5.5 shows the SEM micrographs of sample TMp (three details, a, b, c) and sample TDPp 
(three details, d, e, f). All previous analyses have confirmed that these samples contain ed a 
mixture of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides in different sizes. Fig. 5.5 a, b, c shows that the particles of  
133 
 TMp were not aggregates but individuals in a variety of sizes and shapes with a diameter 
ranging from about 1 micrometer to 1 mm. Similar ly, Fig. 5.5 d, e, f shows a higher amount 
of smaller particles with a diameter in the range from 1 μm to 0.5 mm, than those observed in 
the TMp sample. Rod, modular and irregular shape particles were observed in TMp, whereas 
more spherical shape was identified in TDPp.

 5.4 Discussion 
5.4.1 Comparison between the precipitates formed during chemical oxidation and Fe(II ) 
mediated autotrophic denitrification  
Iron oxides are valuable minerals for many applications due to their low cost 
abundance and physical-chemical properties (Pouran et al., 2014; dos Santos et al, 2016). 
Among Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, hematite, maghemite, magnetite and goethite have the greatest 
interest in industry (Cao et al, 2015). 
FTIR and Raman spectroscopy of the samples formed during Fe(II) mediated 
autotrophic denitrification showed a mixture of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides in each sample. The 
bands observed were similar, indicating that the medium composition and the incubation 
conditions are important factors for the Fe(III) (hydr)oxides formation. However, the 
differences between the precipitates obtained in the abiotic controls and the experiments with 
the microorganisms showed that the different cultures resulted in diverse biogenic Fe(III) 
(oxyhydr)oxides minerals, in agreement with other studies (Senko et al., 2005a, b; Posth et 
al., 2014). Furthermore, the differences in the color of the liquid phase indicated that the 
different microbial cultures likely affected the mineralogy of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. 
All spectra showed a band at around 1000 cm-1, indicating the presence of siderite. 
Siderite spectra consisted of bands at 184, 287, 731 and 1090 cm-1 (Rull et al., 2004), with the 
most common band being at 1090 cm-1. Amounts of phosphate and carbonate minerals were 
recorded by XRF. Similarly, the use of the Acidovorax  strain BoFeN1 in the presence of 
Fe(II) and acetate resulted in a mixture of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, vivianite and amorphous 
Fe(III)-phosphate in the studies by Miot et al. (2009) and Schaedler et al. (2009). 
Ferrihydrite was most probably contained in all the samples, in agreement with the 
majority of studies on nitra te-dependent ferrous oxidation (Straub et al., 1996, 2004; 
Hafenbradl et al., 1996; Lack et al., 2002; Senko et al., 2005 a, b; Hohmann et al., 2009; 
Chakraborty et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2013; Miot et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014, 2015). However, 
FTIR was not a suitable method for the identification of ferrihydrite precipitates that are 
impure and poorly crystalized (2-line ferrihydrite). The Mössbauer spectroscopy might have 
supported a better characterization of such precipitates (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). 
According to Emerson and Moyer (1997), the solids that were formed by microaerophilic 
oxygen-dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria were poorly crystalline Fe(III) precipitate s, such 
as ferrihydrite. However, poorly crystalline phases in aqueous solution have been reported to  
136 
 transform into goethite, hematite, lepidocrocite and other crystalline forms depending on the 
pH and solution chemistry (Schwertmann and Cornell, 2000; Kappler and Newman, 2003). 
This stands in line with this study, with ferrihydrite that was always present with other more 
crystalline phases. Other studies reported that in abiotic systems the transformation of the 
initial precipitates into more crystalline phases was slower than that observed with bacteria . 
This was due to the presence of reducing agents or Fe(II) in combination with surface 
bridging ligands that are known for stimulating reductive dissolution of poorly crystalline 
Fe(III)-oxides and subsequent re-precipitation of more highly ordered phases (Cornell et al., 
1989; Cornell et al., 1991; Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003; Kappler and Newman, 2003). In 
this study, however, the mineralogy of the precipitates was only analyzed at the end of th e 
experiments, and no additional information can be given on the production rate of the 
minerals in the presence or absence of microorganisms. 
In this study, white, grey and reddish precipitates were observed in abiotic controls. In 
agreement, white precipitates from chemical Fe(II) oxidation in both biotic and abiotic 
experiments were reported elsewhere (Miot et al., 2009). Other studies also observed a white 
fluffy structure that turned into a greenish-gray or reddish/orange substance within a week 
after the start of the incubation (Chaudhuri et al., 2001; Miot et al., 2009; Pantke at al., 2012). 
Green rusts as major products cause the grayish-green appearance (Straub et al., 1996) and 
Fe(III) oxyhydroxide or ferrihydrite generally give an orange/brown color to the liquid phase  
(Lack et al., 2002). 
Biogenic minerals showed smaller particles than those formed under abiotic 
conditions. SEM inspection showed varying sizes and geometrical shapes such as irregular, 
rod, modular and spherical in diameter ranging from about 1 µm to 1 mm (Fig. 5.5). 
Similarly, Kappler and Newman (2003) found that Fe(III) precipitates from bottles inoculated 
with the R. ferrooxidans  strain SW2, showed a variety of particles in the range of hundreds of  
nm to 20 μm . These particles showed various shapes, e.g., needles and plates, as well as 
irregular shapes, as also confirmed by Kappler et al. (2005).  
In this study, h ematite (α -Fe2O3), maghemite (Fe 2O3) and a kaganeite (ȕ -FeOOH) 
were formed. In agreement, these Fe(III) (hydr)oxides can be formed in the presence  of 
chloride ions (Raming et al., 2002; dos Santos et al, 2016) and metals provided as chloride 
salts. However, many impurities and different minerals apart from Fe(III) (hydr)oxides were 
present in all precipitates.  
137 
 5.4.1.1 Precipitates in abiotic controls 
Chemical Fe(II) oxidation mainly resulted in the formation of hematite and another 
mineral which can be goethite or akaganeite. The IR bands at 540 and 470 cm-1 are diagnostic 
for hematite (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003), as also confirmed by the reddish color of the 
ACp sample. Furthermore, the strong band observed at 3380 cm-1 in the spectrum most likely 
corresponded to the hydroxyl groups in the hematite crystals (Rochester and Topham, 1979). 
The FTIR band at 1630 cm-1 was probably related to the position of H 2O bending vibrations 
of goethite, whereas the band at 1050 cm-1 could be inferred that the sample contained a 
significant amount of specifically adsorbed impurities in goethite particles (Gotic and Music, 
2007). Park et al. (2014) also observed that chemical Fe(II) oxidation resulted in the 
formation of goethite. 
The revealing of the band at 1630 cm-1 can be also related to the presence of the 
typical O-H bending of akaganeite (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). This derives from the 
additional band that was observed at 1050 cm-1 that has been reported in akaganeite samples 
in KBr discs, and considered to be artefacts (Murad and Bishop, 2000). The Raman spectra of 
the dark spots showed bands at 225, 290-300, 412 and 611 cm-1 that are diagnostic for 
hematite as reported in the FTIR analysis. Furthermore, because of the red spots, a band at 
1321 cm-1 was also observed, corresponding to hematite. According to Oh et al. (1998), the 
bands of a well-established hematite have been shown at 225, 245, 291, 411, 500, 611 and 
1321 cm-1. No goethite or akaganeite bands were, however, observed in Raman spectra.  
 
5.4.1.2 Mineralogy of the precipitates using nitrate-dependent ferrous oxidizers  
Precipitates of the experiments carried out with the Thiobacillus -dominated mixed 
culture were a mixture of hematite, akaganeite and/or ferrihydrite. In industry, hematit e is the 
most used Fe(III) (hydr)oxide, especially for its application as a pigment. Akaganeite has 
electrochemical properties, high catalytic activity and good adsorption ability (Zhang et al. 
2015b). 
The strong band at 1630 and 1050 cm-1 most likely corresponded to akaganeite, in 
agreement with Raman spectra. The broad bands of akaganeite at 700 and ca. 400 cm-1 were 
obtained for the red spots (Boucherit et al., 1989). However, the band at around 700 cm-1 
might have been due to ferrihydrite. In six-line ferrihydrite three bands at 370, 510 and 710 
cm-1 and in two-line ferrihydrite only the strong 710 cm-1 band can be seen (Mazzetti and  
138 
 Thistlethwaite, 2002). Six-line ferrihydrite is a “well”-crystalline ferrihydrite and two-line 
ferrihydrite is the most poorly crystalline form (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). However, 
in the infrared spectrum none of the FTIR bands of ferrihydrite at 3615, 3430, 650, 450 cm-1 
was observed, indicating that the red spots probably corresponded to akaganeite. 
Furthermore, some more white spots were detected in the sample. The bands were similar to 
the bands of the red spots, however the band at 400 cm-1 was more intense, indicating the 
higher amount of most possible akaganeite. 
When the pure culture of T. denitrificans  was used, on top of hematite and/or 
ferrihydrite, maghemite was observed. Maghemite can be used as a magnetic pigment in 
electronics, due to its low cost and chemical stability. Furthermore, maghemite nanoparticles 
can be used in biomedicine (Dronskowski, R., 2001; Pankhurst et al., 2003). The FTIR and 
Raman analyses confirmed the presence of hematite. Raman spectra of the red spots 
identified bands at 700 and 1600 cm-1 that possibly corresponded to maghemite (Hanesch, 
2009). No other maghemite bands at 350, 512, 664, 726 and 1330 cm-1 were identified, in 
contrast to what reported by Jacintho et al. (2007). However, the band at 700 cm-1 could also 
represent two-line ferrihydrite.  
The activated sludge enrichment allowed the production of hematite and maghemite 
and/or magnetite (and/or ferrihydrite). The FTIR spectrum showed bands as the previous 
samples and Raman spectra confirmed the presence of hematite. Additionally, bands at 1300 
and 1600 cm-1 in dark and red spots might correspond to maghemite and/or magnetite. The 
Raman spectrum of white spots showed bands at 350, 500, 700 and 1300 cm-1, very similar to 
the maghemite bands at 350, 512, 664, 726 and 1330 cm-1 reported by Hanesch (2009). 
However, the bands at 3740 and 3725 cm-1, corresponding to OH groups of maghemite were 
not recorded (Busca et al., 1993 ). De Faria et al. (1997) reported three broad peaks at 350, 
500 and 700 cm-1 in maghemite spectrum. According to Hanesch (2009), the broad band from 
673 to 722 cm-1 that can be observed in all samples can be caused by magnetite and 
maghemite. Magnetite bands were observed at 309 and 540 cm-1, whereas maghemite peaks 
at 344 and 490 cm-1. Most possibly, the spectrum was therefore a mixture of magnetite and 
maghemite. In agreement Henesch (2009), studied the biomineralized material produced in 
the soil by anaerobic iron-reducing bacteria and found a mixture of Fe(III)(hydr)oxides that 
consist ed of magnetite and maghemite. The broad band from 653 to 750 cm-1 was caused by 
both minerals. The maghemite band above 1300 cm-1 was relatively weak compared to the 
other bands, probably due to the presence of magnetite. However, the red spots might also  
139 
 have contained six-line or t wo-line ferrihydrite, corresponding to the three bands observed at 
350, 500 and 700 cm-1. 
The use of the pure culture of Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 resulted in hematite 
and maghemite formation (and/or ferrihydrite). FTIR spectra showed the bands of hematite, 
such as the Raman spectra with the additional band at 1600 cm-1 corresponding to 
maghemite. Zhao et al. (2013) reported that the minerals that were formed with the use of 
Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 were nontronite, a clay mineral, but also other secondary 
minerals such as vivianite, ferrihydrite and magnetite. Xiu et al. (2016) used 
Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 and reported that lepidocrocite was the only crystalline 
biogenic solid formed. However, in this study, the medium was different as acetate and 
arsenic, which affected the crystallinity of the precipitates, were not added. 
In agreement to this study, Sun et al. (2009) reported the formation of a mixture of 
Fe(III) oxides dominated by crystalline hematite with the use of an anaerobic sludge 
inoculum from a lab-scale As(III)-oxidizing denitrifying bioreactor. In other studies with 
nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidizers, biogenic goethite formation was reported by the use of 
Acidovorax  strain BoFeN1 using Fe(II) and acetate as co-electron donor (Kappler et al., 
2005; Hohmann et al., 2009; Larese-Casanova et al., 2010; Pantke et al., 2012; Klueglein and 
Kappler, 2013; Miot et al., 2014). Larese-Casanova et al. (2010) demonstrated that goethite 
was produced by abiotic Fe(II) oxidation in the presence of high concentrations of HCO 3-. 
Goethite was also reported with the use Klebsiella Strain  FW33AN a nitrate-dependent 
Fe(II)-oxidizing bacterium (Senko et al., 2005a, b). The formation of amorphous or less 
crystalline Fe(III) oxide minerals by the use of Sphaerotilus natans  strain DSM 6575T in 
mixotrophic conditions with pyruvate and Fe(II) was reported (Park et al., 2014). 
 
5.4.2 Mineralogy for the precipitates in the presence of metals 
Nickel, copper and zinc have been reported to be essential for the structure of several 
precipitates, such as akaganeite and maghemite (Deliyanni et al. 2007; Drofenik et al., 2008; 
Nador et al, 2013; dos Santos et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2017). However, no 
previous studies have investigated the effects of these metals on the formation of biogenic 
minerals by nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms. In this study, all the 
precipitates contained Cu, Ni, Zn, indicating the absorption and/or co-precipitation with  
140 
 Fe(III)(hydr)oxides. This is in agreement with the decrease of the soluble Cu, Ni and Zn 
concentration that was observed in the batch experiments (chapter 4).  
The addition of Cu, Ni and Zn resulted in similar Fe(III) (hydr)oxides of the 
precipitates obtained in the absence of metals. However, the infrared spectrum of the 
precipitate obtained with the Thiobacillus -mixed culture in the presence of Cu (TMCp) 
showed an additional band at around 500 cm-1 that was due to the Fe-O stretch of akaganeite. 
This additional band might be due to a higher amount of akaganeite formed because of Cu. 
Another explanation is that the strong band of 3448 cm-1 might be attributed to the surface 
hydroxyl groups of goethite, but the intense band of hydroxyl stretch of goethite at 3140 cm-1 
(Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003) and the typical band at 3666 cm-1 were not observed, most 
likely due to the presence of phosphate in the medium as reported by Russell et al. (1979). 
TMCp was most likely a mixture of hematite and akaganeite as TMp, indicating that the 
addition of Cu did not affect the mineralogy. Similar ly, using the other microbial cultures, the 
mineralogy of the precipitates was not considerably affected by the presence of Cu. However, 
the addition of Ni and Zn likely stimulated the formation of maghemite. 
The infrared spectrum obtained from the sample of the bottles inoculated with 
Thiobacillus-mixed culture in the presence of Ni (TMNp) showed some additional peaks. One 
band was revealed at 940 cm-1, which has been reported when ferrihydrite contains a few 
percent of Si (Schwetmann and Thalmann, 1976). In this study, the presence of Si was 
confirmed by the XRF analysis. Additionally, the band at 450 cm-1 and a weak band at 650 
cm-1 might correspond to bulk OH deformations of ferrihydrite, whereas he band at 3430 cm-
1 can be explained as the bulk OH stretch of ferrihydrite. As in previous samples, a strong 
band at 1630 cm-1 likely indicated the presence of akaganeite. However, the band at 1050 cm-
1 was not observed. None of the typical FTIR bands of hematite was recorded in TMNp 
sample, but hematite was revealed by the Raman spectrum of the dark spots. Red spots might 
be either akaganeite or ferrihydrite as bands at about 400 and 700 cm-1 were recorded. The 
additional broad band of either maghemite or hematite at about 1300 cm-1 was observed, 
indicating that the addition of Ni, might stimulate the formation of maghemite. Similar ly, the 
same Fe(III) (hydr)oxides of the precipit ates as in the absence of metals and the stimulation 
of the formation of maghemite was observed in TDPNp, ASNp and PGNp samples.  
The FTIR spectrum of the precipitates taken from the bottles inoculated with 
Thiobacillus -mixed culture in the presence of Zn (TMZ) showed a mixture of ferrihydrite and 
akaganeite. An additional band at 1384 cm-1 might be associated with nitrate in ferrihydrite  
141 
 (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003).The FTIR and Raman spectra were similar to those 
obtained with the addition of Ni for all microbial cultures, indicating that also the presence of 
Zn likely stimulated the formation of maghemite. 
 
5.5 Conclusions 
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification resulted in the formation of a mixture of 
Fe(III) (hydr)oxides of poorly crystalline (e.g. ferrihydrite), but also in some crystalline 
phases such as hematite, akaganeite and maghemite. In abiotic controls, the chemical Fe(II) 
oxidation resulted in hematite formation and goethite or akaganeite. Precipitates of the 
experiments carried out with the Thiobacillus -dominated mixed culture were a mixture of 
hematite, akaganeite and/or ferrihydrite. When T. denitrificans  was used on top of hematite 
and/or ferrihydrite, maghemite was observed. The use of pure culture of Pseudogulbenkiania  
strain 2002 resulted in hematite and maghemite formation and the activated sludge 
enrichment allowed the production of hematite and maghemite and/or magnetite (and/or 
ferrihydrite). No difference in the mineralogy of the precipitates was observed with the 
addition of Cu, whereas the addition of Ni and Zn markedly stimulated the formation of 
maghemite. Heavy metals in the precipitates were identified by chemical analysis, indicating 
co-precipitation and/or absorption in Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. The recovery of heavy metals is an 
important application for Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification.

CHAPTER 6 
 
Evaluation of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic 
denitrification in continuous flow packed-bed 
reactors

 6.1 Introduction 
Nitrate contamination of water resources is an increasingly serious global problem 
which has a significant impact on environment, such as eutrophication, and human health, i.e 
cancer and methemoglobinemia (Zhang et al., 2015). Nitrate pollution is mainly due to the 
use of chemical fertilizers and the discharge of industrial, domestic and nitrate containing 
wastewaters, such as landfill leachate (Manconi et al., 2007; Ghafari et al., 2008; Chen et al., 
2014). 
 Physicochemical and biological denitrification methods are the main technologies for 
the removal of nitrate from water resources. Conventional methods are ion exchange, reverse 
osmosis, adsorption, and electrodialysis. However, the high costs of these technologies limit 
their applications (Shrimali et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2016). Biological denitrification process 
is a well-developed approach and considered cost-effective to remove nitrate from 
wastewaters, due to a high efficiency and no production of by-products (Foglar et al., 2005; 
Zhang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016). Biological denitrification can be performed 
heterotrophically or autotrophically. Heterotrophic denitrifiers require carbon source, making 
this process not suitable for the treatment of low C/N ratio water. Addition of external carbon 
source would result in extra operating costs as well as the presence of organic residues that  
generate secondary organic pollution (Zhang et al., 2015).  
Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification is an alternative biotechnology to 
simultaneously remove nitrate and recover iron through the formation of Fe(III) precipitates 
(Straub et al., 1996) and can be particularly efficient for the treatment of low-organic 
wastewaters (Kiskira et al., 2017a, b), even in the presence of metals (Papirio et al., 2014 ; 
Zou et al., 2014, 2015). At neutral pH, autotrophic denitrification yields energy, since the 
redox potential of ferrous/ferric couples is about +200 mV and is lower than that of 
nitrate/nitrogen gas (+710 mV) (Hedrich et al., 2011). 
The first microorganisms capable of maintaining biological nitrate-dependent Fe(II) 
oxidation were discovered 20 years ago (Straub et al., 1996). Since then all the other 
microbial species reported to maintain Fe(II)-driven denitrification have been reviewed in 
detail by Kiskira et al., (2017a). However, limited work has been done in the field of 
wastewater treatment, especially within continuous-flow bioreactor applications. An up-flow 
anaerobic sludge bed reactor (UASB) of 0.8 L, inoculated with anaerobic granular sludge, 
was used by Zhang et al. (2015). The process was observed at its steady state during 32-47 d  
151 
 with nitrate and Fe(II) removal reaching 45 and 44%, respectively. The efficiency of the 
process decreased during the experimentation due to the decrease of hydraulic retention time 
(HRT) and pH. In another study, two 420 mL continuous-flow sand packed bed columns, 
inoculated with activated sludge and operated with an HRT of 24 h were used for Fe(II) and 
As(III) oxidation coupled to autotrophic denitrification (Sun et al., 2009). However, acetate 
was used as an additional electron donor and the process was mainly addressed to the 
immobilization of As onto the biogenic ferric (Fe(III)) (hydr)oxides produced. Zhou et al. 
(2016) used a continuous-upflow biofilter packed with sponge iron and inoculated with 
Microbacterium  sp. W5, a nitrate reducing and Fe(II) oxidizing strain. The maximum 
nitrogen removal efficiency was about 90% with an HRT of 24 h. 
In this work, Fe(II) mediated autotrophic denitrification was investigated as a 
biotechnology for nitrate removal using two identical up-flow packed bed reactors (PBRs) 
made of Plexiglas and fed with different influent nitrate concentrations. The bioreactors were 
seeded with the Thiobacillus  mixed culture, in order to optimize the operating parameters 
such as the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the nitrate loading rate and evaluate their 
influence on nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation.  
 
6.2 Materials and methods 
6.2.1 Reactor design 
Two identical up-flow PBRs were used for the continuous flow experiments. Figure 
6.1 shows the physical schematic of the reactors. The reactors were made up of Plexiglas, 
with height and internal diameter being 24 and  8 cm, respectively, corresponding to an 
effective volume  of 0.98 L and a total volume of 1.50 L. The filler zone, which  had a height 
of 16 cm, consisted of granular activated carbon, as reported by Papirio et al. (2014), which 
was used as biomass carrier. Glass pearls with a diameter in the range 0.4-1.0 cm were placed 
in the bottom of the reactors to avoid blocking of the inlet with activated carbon. The effluent 
was discharged by gravity from an outlet port located 3.5 cm above the top of filler. The 
reactors were operated in continuous mode and samples were collected from the outlet port.

pump; 2 filler 
 
 
6.2.2 Inoculum and reactor start- up 
The Thiobacillus -dominated mixed culture, enriched on both thiosulfate and iron as 
electron donors (chapters 3 and 4), was inoculated into the reactors. The PBRs were seeded 
with 50 mL of the microbial culture, having an initial VSS concentration of 200 mg VSS/L. 
After seeding, the bioreactors were flushed with nitrogen. The operation of the reactors 
started with an “acclimation phase ” performed under batch conditions for 1 week. The feed 
Fe(II) and NO 3- concentrations were 600 and 120 mg/L, respectively. The culture medium 
characteristics were described in section 3.2.1.  
 
6.2.3 Feed synthetic wastewater and PBRs operation 
A synthetic wastewater was continuously fed from the bottom of the reactors by a 
peristaltic pump. Initially, the two PBRs (Reactor 1 and 2) were fed with 120 and 60 mg/L of 
nitrate and 600 and 300 mg Fe(II)/L, respectively, in order to maintain a Fe(II):NO 3- molar 
ratio of 5:1. EDTA was supplemented at a EDTA:Fe(II) molar ratio of 0.5:1. The pH and 
 
153 
 temperature were 6.5-7.7 and 22±2°C, respectively. The feed solution contained the basal 
medium and trace elements, as described in section 3.2.1, and were flushed with N 2 prior to 
being fed to the PBRs.  
The operation was divided into 5 periods (Table 6.1) along 153 days.

The feed nitrate concentration was increased to 250 and 180 mg/L for reactor 1 
(PBR1) and reactor 2 (PBR2), respectively, on day 64. However, PBR2 operation was 
stopped after 90 d due to a leakage, and continued after 1 week with a feed NO 3- 
concentration of 250 mg/L. HRT was gradually decreased from 31 to 20 h for both PBRs 
from day 93 to day 153. On day 116, the operation of the two PBRs was differentiated. In 
PBR1, the NO 3- concentration was maintained stable at 250 mg/L, in order to evaluate the 
effect of higher nitrate loading rates at decreasing HRTs. Conversely, in PBR2 the nitrate 
loading rate remained stable, by gradually decreasing the influent nitrate concentration from 
250 to 180 mg/L according to the HRT used. On day 76, 50 mL of biomass was inoculated 
for enhancing the nitrate removal in PBR1. The process was monitored by sampling both the 
liquid phase and biomass.  
  
  
154 
 6.2.4 Analytical methods 
Ferrous iron, nitrate and pH were analyzed every 48 h. The NO 3- concentration was 
analyzed by ion chromatography (IC) with chemically suppressed conductivity using a 883 
Basic IC Plus system equipped with a Metrosep A Supp 5-150/4.0 column and a 863 
Compact IC Autosampler (Metrohm, Switzerland). The liquid samples were filtered with 
0.22 μm syringe cellulose membrane s (EMD Millipore, USA) prior to IC analysis. Ferrous 
iron was quantified photometrically by using UV-1800 240V IVDD UV spectrophotometer 
(Shimadzu, Japan), following the analytical method with 1,10 phenanthroline reported by 
Ahoranta et al. , (2016). Fe(II) determination was performed immediately after the sampling, 
for avoiding Fe(II) chemical oxidation. VSS were analyzed according to the standard 
methods (APHA, 1992). 
 
6.3 Results  
Two identical PBRs were operated in order to investigate the performance of Fe(II)-
mediated autrotrophic denitrification under continuous-flow conditions. Nitrate removal and 
Fe(II) oxidation were evaluated using the Thiobacillus -mixed culture in PBR1 and PBR2 
operated for 153 days under different operational conditions (Fig. 6.2a, Fig. 6.3a). Figure 
6.2b,c and Figure 6.3b,c show nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation in PBR1 and PBR2, 
respectively.  
Table 6.2 reports the nitrate removal efficiency and rates as well as Fe(II) oxidation 
efficiency and rates at the end of each experimental period in both PBRs. Throughout the 
operation of reactors, no nitrite was detected as intermediate of denitrification in agreement 
with other studies (Straub et al., 1996; Weber at al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2015 ). 
As depicted in Fig. 6.2b and Fig 6.3b, during period 1 (0-63 days) nitrate removal and 
Fe(II) oxidation were 70 and 85%, respectively, with an effluent NO 3- concentration that 
gradually decreased to 37 mg NO 3-/L in PRB1. Fe(II) oxidation occurred with a Fe(II):NO 3- 
molar ratio in the range 4.7 to 7.4, indicating that part of Fe(II) oxidation was not associated 
with nitrate removal as Fe(II) was most likely oxidized due to the chemical reaction with 
residual DO. 
During 0-63 d, Fe(II)-mediated denitrification resulted in an effluent nitrate 
concentration decreasing till to 36 mg NO 3-/L, corresponding to 41% of nitrate removal in  
155 
 PBR2. Thus, the higher feed nitrate concentration used for the PBR1 operation led to a higher 
nitrate removal by the Thiobacillus -mixed culture. Fe(II) oxidation and nitrate removal 
reached up to 70 and 85% with a specific nitrate removal rate of 211.7 mg/(g VSS·d).  
During the operation of the PBRs in Period II (64-92 d), the influent nitrate 
concentration was doubled to 240 mg NO 3-/L in PBR1, and increased by 3 times up to 180 
mg NO 3-/L in PBR2. As a result, nitrate removal decreased from 70 to 62% in PBR1 only one 
day after the variation of the operating conditions. On the contrary, Fe(II)-driven 
denitrification was enhanced in PBR2. Nitrate removal increased by 20% at 64 d 
corresponding to a nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation of 64% and 72%, respectively. Before 
the occurrence of a leakage at the end of Period II (day 92), nitrate removal and Fe(II) 
oxidation further increased to 80 and 94%, respectively, in PBR2. 
In order to stimulate denitrification in PBR1, 50 mL of biomass was inoculated on 
day 76. The effluent nitrate concentration gradually decreased and nitrate removal reached 
88% on day 92. Fe(II) oxidation was enhanced up to 93%. The specific nitrate removal rate 
was as high as 317.5 mg/(g VSS·d) after 92 d (end of period II).  
Starting from period III (93-115 d), HRT was gradually decreased in both PBRs with 
the aim to evaluate the effect of HRT on the denitrification process efficiency. At an HRT of 
28 h, nitrate removal decreased by only 3% in PBR1. From that point, until the end of the 
period III, the nitrate removal slightly increased and reached 88%, as at the end of the Period 
II, indicating that the denitrifiers adapted to the new operating conditions. The specific nitrate 
removal rate was 341.0 mg/(g VSS·d). During periods IV (116-139 days) and V (140-153 
days), Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification was stable with a nitrate removal and a 
Fe(II) oxidation being at 86±2% and 96±3%, respectively, till day 153. Denitrification was 
not affected when decreasing the HRT from 28 to 24h during Period IV (days) and from 24 to 
20 h during Period V (140 to 153 d). The specific nitrate removal rate reached up to 337.1 
mg/(g VSS·d) at the end of the experiment. 
At the beginning of Period III (day 93), the influent nitrate concentration was 
increased from 180 to 250 mg/L for enhancing the process after the leakage occurred in 
PBR2. Nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation, however, constantly decreased and were 10 and 
34% lower on day 115 than those observed on day 92.

In Period IV and V, the HRT and the feed nitrate concentration were simultaneously 
decreased in order to maintain a stable nitrate loading rate in PBR2. Denitrification was 
observed at its steady state during days 116-153 with a nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation 
of 66±4% and 70±2%, respectively. A lower feed NO 3- concentration did not enhance the 
nitrate removal efficiency. The specific nitrate removal rate decreased to 272.4 mg/(g 
VSS·d).

 6.4 Discussion  
6.4.1 Nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation in continuous-flow packed-bed reacto rs 
In this study, the highest nitrate removal rates and efficiency were observed at the 
highest feed nitrate concentration. This is in contrast with what reported by the only two 
studies on the continuous-flow application of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification 
(Zhang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016). Zhang et al. (2015) reported that feed concentra tions 
higher than 130 mg NO 3-/L resulted in a lower nitrate removal in an up-flow anaerobic sludge 
bed reactor (UASB) with a total working volume of 0.8 L, inoculated with granular sludge 
collected from a full-scale UASB reactor treating a wastewater from a paper mill. An 
increase of the influent nitrate concentration from 30 to 170 mg NO 3-/L led to an almost 70% 
lower nitrate removal efficiency. Similarly, in a continuous flow up-flow biofilter packed 
with sponge iron and inoculated with a pure culture of Microbacterium  sp. W5, nitrate 
removal decreased by approximately 10% when the influent nitrate concentration was 
increased from 30 to 100 mg NO 3-/L (Zhou et al., 2016). 
The reason for this discrepancy between the current study and those present in the 
scientific literature might be that the biofilm used in this study was longer enriched on Fe(II) 
and was capable of reaching a higher nitrate removal at higher influent nitrate concentra tions. 
At lower feed concentrations, the process was less stimulated and the nitrate removal 
efficiency remained stable. The Thiobacillus -mixed culture had previously been enriched on 
Fe(II) in batch experiments (chapters 3 and 4), and then was inoculated to the PBRs for 7 
days using a feed nitrate concentration of 120 mg NO 3-/L, thus 4-fold higher than that used 
by Zhang et al. (2015) and Zhou et al. (2016). Despite an enrichment on NO 3- and Fe(II) was 
performed by Zhou et al. (2016), an acclimation of biomass in the reactors was not 
performed, thus leading to a lower nitrate removal performance. 
Another possible reason of the better Fe(II)-driven denitrification performance at the 
highest influent nitrate concentrations achieved in this study was likely due to the presence of 
EDTA in an EDTA:Fe(II) molar ratio of 0.5:1. EDTA chelates Fe(II) and minimizes the 
chemical oxidation of Fe(II) with residual oxygen (Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013). 
Moreover, EDTA prevents the cell encrustation by the Fe(III) hydroxide mineral formation, 
allowing the activity of microbes (Shelobolina et al., 2003; Chakraborty et al., 2011). Zhou et 
al. (2016) initially operated a packed bio-filter with a feed Fe(II) concentration up to 1500-
1800 mg Fe(II)/L, without supplementing EDTA. The authors reported that Fe(II)  
160 
 concentrations higher than 800 mg Fe(II)/L resulted in a decrease of nitrate removal 
efficiency. Subsequently , when EDTA was added at 10 g/L, nitrate removal increased back to 
90% even at a feed Fe(II) concentration of 1100 Fe(II)/L. 
During the PBR operation, the average molar ratio between the consumed Fe(II) and 
nitrate was 5.1 and 4.8 in PBR1 and PB R2, respectively, which is in agreement with 
theoretical amount suggested by Sorensen (1987) (see eq. 2.1). Zhang et al. (2015) reported a 
lower molar ratio, i.e. 2.9. Similar ly, a Fe(II):NO 3- molar ratio, in the range 2.5-5.0, has been 
reported in other studies with activated sludge (Nielsen and Nielsen, 1998; Li et al., 2014). A 
lower Fe(II)/NO 3- ratio than 4.0 indicates the production of intermediates such as nitrite and 
nitrous oxide, while a molar ratio higher than 7.5 results in production of ammonium (Li et 
al., 2014). 
 
6.4.2 Comparison with the previous batch experiments and other denitrification 
processes 
The implementation of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification in continuous-flow 
experiments resulted in higher specific nitrate removal rates compared to those obtained in 
the previous batch experiments (Section 3.3), due to a longer acclimation of the biomass and 
a better denitrifying performance of the biofilm in continuous-flow experiments, as also 
reported by Zhang et al. (2015). A 32 and 26 times higher specific nitrate removal rate, i.e. 
337.1 and 272.4 mg/( g VSS·d) was achieved for PBR1 and PBR2, respectively, than those 
observed in the same above mentioned batch tests.  
During the steady state the maximum volumetric loading rates (VLRs) were 280 m g 
NO 3-/(L·d) and 210 mg NO 3-/(L·d) for PBR1 and PBR2, respectively. The maximum 
volumetric removal rates (VRR) of nitrate were 240 mg NO 3-/(L·d) for PBR1 and 160 mg 
NO 3-/(L·d) for PBR2 and were recorded at steady state. Zhang et al., (2015) reported a 
similar maximum VRR of 190 mg NO 3-/(L·d), but the VRR at steady state was as low as 73 
mg NO 3-/(L·d), because of the pH decrease. A much lower VRR, i.e. 25 mg NO 3-/(L·d), was 
observed in Zhou et al., (2016). 
 
  
161 
 Compared to other denitrification processes, Fe(II)-driven autotrophic denitrification 
showed to be a promising process, but with still lower efficiencies than other well-established 
technologies. For instance, sulfur-driven autotrophic denitrification VRRs in the range 50-
560 mg NO 3-/(L·d) have been observed in continuous flow experiments (Park and Yoo, 2009; 
Show et al., 2013), i.e. higher by approximately 55% than the highest obtained in this study. 
Heterotrophic denitrification with ethanol in denitrifying cultures resulted in 400 mg NO 3-
/(L·d) of VRR in a similar bioreactor configuration (Papirio et al., 2014). However, the 
results of this study are quite encouraging and stimulate further studies for the optimization of 
Fe(II)mediated autotrophic denitrification as a future biotechnology for nitrate removal. 
 
6.4.3 Effect of pH and HRT 
The pH in the influent was maintained at 7.7 during the entire operation of both 
PBRs, as Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification produces acidity and a feed pH highe r 
than 7.0 is recommended (Straub et al., 1996; Weber et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2015). During 
denitrification, the effluent pH gradually decreased to 6.4 without affecting the process. 
Zhang et al. (2015) reported that a pH lower than 3.0 in the reactor resulted in a decrease of 
nitrate removal efficiency by 80%. However, nitrate removal was higher than 95% as long as 
the effluent pH was higher than 6.0. In acidic environments, Fe(II) is not favored to act as 
electron donor to yield energy as under circumneutral conditions, since the redox potential of 
ferrous/ferric couple in acidic liquors is approximately +770 mV, i.e. much higher than +430 
mV of the NO 3-/NO 2- couple (Hedrich et al., 2011). 
In this study, HRT was decreased from 31 h to 20 h. Denitrification was not affected 
when decreasing the HRT, indicating that further continuous-flow experiments should be 
performed in order to reduce the HRT. In contrast, the efficiency of the process was 
negatively affected due to the decrease of HRT in Zhang et al. (2015). At HRT 18 h, nitrate 
removal and Fe(II) oxidation were above 95%, however when HRT was only slightly reduced 
to 17 h, 60 and 38% of nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation, respectively, were observed. A 
stable HRT of 24 h was used in Zhou et al. (2016), as the effect of decreasing HRT was not 
investigated. 
  
162 
 6.5 Conclusions 
Fe(II) mediated autotrophic denitrification in continuous flow experiments was 
maintained in two PBRs with a nitrate removal efficiency higher than 65% also at an HRT of 
20 h. During the steady state the maximum VLR and VRR were 280 and 240 m g NO 3-/(L·d) 
for PBR1 and 210 and 160 mg NO 3-/(L·d) for PBR2. Results showed that the nitrate removal 
rate increased at increasing feed nitrate concentrations. At the steady state, nitrate removal 
and Fe(II) oxidation were 86±2% and 95.5±2.5%, respectively, in PBR1, whereas 65.5±3.5% 
and 70.0±2%, in PBR2. The lower initial feed NO 3- concentration resulted in lower 
efficiencies in PBR2.

CHAPTER 7 
 
General discussion and future perspectives  
167 
 7.1 Introduction and objectives 
Water quality is vital for humans and ecosystems. The drinking water standard set by 
the World Health Organization (WHO) (1993) for nitrate is 50 mg/L. Nitrate is the most 
common pollutant in water resources, due to the extensive use of fertilizers in agriculture and 
the discharges of raw and treated wastewater (Shrimali et al., 2001). Therefore, the water 
should be treated properly and wastewater treatment be done carefully. The conventional 
methods for nitrate removal of wastewaters are ion exchange, adsorption, chemical treatment, 
membrane technology, and biological treatment (Park and Yoo, 2009). However, the 
physicochemical methods are expensive and the biological treatment application has mainly 
been focused on heterotrophic denitrification, which is not desirable for the treatment of low-
organic wastewaters (Shrimali et al., 2001; Park and Yoo, 2009). Furthermore, in mining 
wastewaters, nitrate co-occurs with valuable metals, including iron that can be recovered by 
using biotechnologies, such as autotrophic denitrification (Papirio et al., 2013; Papirio et al., 
2014). 
 Fe(II) iron-mediated autotrophic denitrification is a new bioprocess for nitrate 
removal and removal/recovery of iron from wastewaters (Kiskira et al., 2017a). The use of 
denitrifying Fe(II) oxidizers results in the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas and the 
bioprecipitation/biorecovery of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides that can be subsequently removed and 
recovered, with the possible co-precipitation or adsorption of other metals (Hohmann et al., 
2009; Ahoranta et al., 2016). Recently, the process has gained scientific interest over classical 
heterotrophic denitrification especially for the treatment of industrial wastewaters containing 
very low amount of biodegradable COD (Zhang et al., 2015). Despite several detailed studies 
on the microbiology of these microorganisms capable for nitrate-dependent ferrous oxidation , 
little research has been done in order to investigate the Fe(II) mediated autotrophic 
denitrification as a biotechnology for nitrate removal and iron recovery.  
This research investigated the efficiency of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification 
in terms of Fe(II) oxidation and nitrate removal with different microbial cultures. An 
extensive review of the current knowledge about Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification 
was conducted in Chapter 2, presenting a short summary of iron biogeochemistry and the 
environmental concerns of Fe(II) and nitrate, the characteristics of the Fe(II)-oxidizing 
denitrifiers, the operating conditions adopted in the existing studies, the characteristics of the 
produced Fe(III) hydr(oxides) and the influence of other metals on the process. Finally, the 
use of pyrite as an alternative electron donor is discussed. Obviously, there are several factors  
168 
 affecting the process: the microbial cultures used, pH, the EDTA/Fe(II) ratio, the presence of 
other heavy metals, the operation of the experiments (batch or continuous-flow mode) and 
how long and on which electron donors the microorganisms were enriched. All these factors 
were taken into account in this PhD research for designing suitable bioreactors for Fe(II)-
mediated autotrophic denitrification. The major findings from individual chapters of this PhD 
are shown in Figure 7.1.

 7.2 Major research findings 
7.2.1 Influence of pH, EDTA:Fe(II) ratio and microbial culture on Fe(II)-mediated 
autotrophic denitrification  
The objectives of this work was to investigate the efficiency of Fe(II)-mediated 
autotrophic denitrification in terms of Fe(II) oxidation and nitrate removal with different 
microbial cultures in batch bioassays and evaluate the effects of decreasing pH and 
EDTA/Fe(II) ratios on the process. Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification was 
investigated in batch experiments with different microbial cultures (Kiskira et al, 2017b) . 
Table 3.2 reports the specific nitrate and Fe(II) oxidation rates with all microbial cultures. 
Nitrate removal was above 60% in all the bioassays operated at pH 7.0 and an EDTA:Fe(II) 
ratio of 2.0. In all experiments, no nitrite was detected as intermediate of denitrification, 
indicating a complete nitrate reduction to N 2. Initially, experiments were conducted with the 
use of Fe(II) as sole electron donor (Fig. 3.1a). The pure T. denitrificans  culture, activated 
sludge inoculum and Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 were capable of maintaining Fe(II)-
mediated autotrophic denitrification. Conversely, denitrification did not occur in the 
bioassays with the Thiobacillus -mixed culture.  
Then, the capability for Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification of the previously 
Fe(II)-enriched Thiobacillus -mixed culture and T. denitrificans  culture was investigated by 
also supplementing thiosulfate as additional electron donor (Fig. 3.2). Both the Thiobacillus -
mixed and pure T. denitrificans  cultures were stimulated in the presence of thiosulfate. After 
enriching and acclimating the Thiobacillus -mixed and pure T. denitrificans  cultures on 
thiosulfate, Fe(II)-based denitrification was again investigated with Fe(II) as sole electron 
donor. The use of a more enriched Thiobacillus -mixed culture resulted in a higher biological 
Fe(II) oxidation coupled to denitrification (Fig. 3.1b). The specific nitrate removal rate 
significantly increased and reached 8.6 mg/(g VSS·d). Fe(II) oxidation and NO 3- reduction 
were 68 and 83%, respectively.  
The rates of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification obtained in this work were 
lower than those reported in similar batch experiments aimed at investigating classical 
heterotrophic denitrification or sulfur-driven autotrophic denitrification. Di Capua et al. 
(2016), reported a N- NO 3- removal rate of 52.2 mg·L-1·d-1, i.e. 3-fold higher than the highest 
achieved in this study by sulfur-driven autotrophic denitrification, whereas Papirio et al . 
(2014) observed a nitrate removal rate up to approximately 400 mg·L-1·d-1 by using 
denitrifying cultures enriched on ethanol. However, the implementation of Fe(II)-mediated  
170 
 autotrophic denitrification in continuous-flow experiments resulted in higher nitrate removal 
rates, due to a longer acclimation of the biomass and a better denitrifying performance of the 
biofilm in continuous-flow experiments, as previously reported by Zhang et al. (2015). In this 
study, a 32 and 26 times higher specific nitrate removal rate, i.e. 337.1 and 272.4 mg/(g 
VSS·d) was reported for PBR1 and PBR2, respectively. In comparison with heterotrophic 
and sulfur-based autotrophic denitrification, Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification does 
not result in nitrite and this represents a major advantage as nitrite is reported to be inhibitory 
for many denitrifiers and nitrogen is thus entirely removed from the liquid phase (Straub et 
al., 1996; Zhang et al., 2015). 
EDTA is used to improve Fe(II) solubility and bioavailability and has been used as 
chelating agent in many other studies (Kumaraswamy et al., 2006; Chakraborty et al., 2011; 
Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013; Kanaparthi et al., 2013; Kanaparthi and Conrad, 2015; 
Klueglein et al., 2015). Fe-EDTA optimizes the process as the abiotic reactions are 
minimized (Chakraborty and Picardal, 2013) and prevents Fe(III) hydroxide mineral 
formation allowing the activity of microbes (Zhou, et al., 2016). The amount of EDTA is of 
major importance in Fe(II)-based denitrification. Microbial activity can be influenced by the 
molar EDTA:Fe(II) ratio as microbial cultures differently tolerate the inhibitory effects of 
free EDTA and Fe-EDTA species (Klueglein et al., 2015). Free EDTA is generally the most 
toxic EDTA form to bacteria as it disrupts the cell membranes (Oviedo and Rodríguez, 2003). 
The NO 3- removal efficiency achieved at EDTA:Fe(II) ratios of 2.0, 1.0 and 0.5 was as 
shown in Fig. 3.3. The most significant effect of the EDTA concentration was observed with 
the Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 culture, indicating the lower tolerance of this species to 
EDTA. The lowest molar EDTA:Fe (II) ratio resulted in an almost double nitrate removal 
rate compared to that achieved with an EDTA:Fe(II) ratio of 2.0. This study demonstrated 
that a ll the investigated cultures were alleviated by decreasing the EDTA concentration. 
pH also is a very important parameter affecting both microbial activity and iron 
speciation/solubility (Hedrich et al., 2011). At pH < 4.0, Fe(II) is more stable but the 
inhibition of most denitrifiers occurs (Johnson et al., 2012). The known Fe(II)-oxidizing 
denitrifiers are neutrophilic (Hedrich et al., 2011), and therefore up to now the majority of 
studies was performed at pH between 6.0 and 8.0 (Kiskira et al., 2017a) (Chapter 2). During 
this research, the effect of decreasing pH from 7.0 to 5.0 was assessed. The activity of the 
Thiobacillus -mixed and activated sludge enrichment was enhanced by decreasing pH from 
7.0 to 6.0 (Fig. 3.3), whereas the two pure cultures of T. denitrificans and 
Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 demonstrated to be less tolerant to the decreasing pH. Both  
171 
 chemical and biological Fe(II) oxidation coupled to denitrification were repressed at pH 5, 
resulting in lower Fe(II) oxidation rates. 
 
7.2.2 Effect of copper, nickel and zinc on Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification  
The effect of Cu, Ni, Zn on Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification in the 
efficiency and rates of nitrate removal and how the different microbial cultures tolerated the 
effect of metals were investigated in another set of batch bioassays. The microbial activity of 
denitrifying microorganisms can be either stimulated or inhibited by the presence of heavy  
metals. Metals can enhance metabolic degradation, whereas at higher concentrations can 
change the microbial enzyme conformation and block essential functional groups (Gikas, 
2007; Giller et al., 2009).  
During this study, a decrease of the soluble Cu, Ni and Zn concentration occurred in 
the first 4 d in all the experiments (Fig. 4.1), likely due to metal precipitation and biosorption 
(Crane at al., 2010) . Figure 4.2 shows the nitrate removal efficiency (%) achieved after 10 d 
in the bioassays seeded with the four microbial cultures at different initial metal 
concentrations. All metals negatively affected denitrification, whereas no stimulation was 
observed even at the lowest Ni, Cu and Zn concentrations. The highest efficiency and rates of 
nitrate removal were achieved with Thiobacillus -dominated mixed culture, whereas 
Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 was the least effective. At an initial concentration of 20.0 - 
40.0 mg Me/L, Cu showed to be the most inhibitory metal for mixed cultures, with an 
inhibition of nitrate removal in the range 33-66%. A lower impact was observed with the 
addition of Zn that resulted in 17 to 41% inhibition. Ni had the lowest inhibitory effect than 
Cu and Zn. A 5-34% inhibition at concentrations of 20.0 to 40.0 mg Ni/L was recorded. A 
higher sensitivity to metal toxicity was observed for the pure cultures. The results obtained in 
this study were similar compared to the existing literature for denitrifying bacteria (Ochoa-
Herrera et al. 2011; Zou et al. 2013). However, this was the first study reporting the effect of 
these metals on Fe(II) mediated autotrophic denitrification. 
 
7.2.3 Mineral characterization of the Fe(III)(hydr)oxides during Fe(II)-driven 
denitrification 
The recovery of iron and other heavy metals by the formation of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides 
is an important application of some microbial processes such as Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic  
172 
 denitrification (Hohmann et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2009; Ahoranta et al., 2016; Xiu et al., 
2016). Mineral characterization of the precipitates formed during the Fe(II) mediated 
autotrophic denitrification was performed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Raman 
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-Ray 
Analyser (SEM-EDX) and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The 
evaluation of the particular Fe(III) precipitates is important in order to decide on the “reuse 
strategy ” to adopt and the applications in which to use them. Some of the major applications 
are pigments for paints and the construction industry, magnetic pigments and ferrites, 
catalysts for industrial syntheses, adsorbents for water and gas purification and for low level 
radioactive waste decontamination, production of photochemicals and fertilizers (Cornell and 
Schwertmann, 2003).  
FTIR and Raman spectroscopy of the samples formed during Fe(II) mediated 
autotrophic denitrification showed a mixture of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides in each sample. The 
observed bands were similar, indicating that the medium composition and the incubation 
conditions are important factors for Fe(III) (hydr)oxides formation. However, differences 
between the abiotic controls and the precipitates formed from different microorganisms were 
observed, showing that different microorganisms resulted in different biogenic Fe(III) 
(oxyhydr)oxides minerals, in agreement with other studies (Senko et al., 2005; Posth et al., 
2014). Ferrihydrite was most probably present in all the biogenic precipitates, as also 
reported by many authors (Straub et al., 1996, 2004; Lack et al., 2002; Senko et al., 2005 ; 
Hohmann et al., 2009; Chakraborty et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2013) 
In abiotic controls, the chemical Fe(II) oxidation resulted in hematite formation and 
goethite or akaganeite. Precipitates of the experiments carried out with the Thiobacillus -
dominated mixed culture were a mixture of hematite, akaganeite and/or ferrihydrite. When T. 
denitrificans  was used, on top of hematite and/or ferrihydrite, maghemite was observed. The 
use of pure culture of Pseudogulbenkiania  strain 2002 resulted in hematite and maghemite 
formation and the activated sludge enrichment allowed the production of hematite and 
maghemite and/or magnetite (and/or ferrihydrite). In agreement, the formation of a mixture of 
Fe(III) oxides dominated by crystalline hematite by Fe(II) mediated autotrophic 
denitrification   has also been reported by Sun et al. (2009). The use of Cu, Ni and Zn resulted 
in very similar Fe(III) (hydr)oxides than those obtained in the absence of metals. However, 
the addition of Ni and Zn stimulated the formation of maghemite. No other study investigated 
the effect of the addition of Cu, Ni and Zn on the formation of biogenic minerals by nitrate- 
173 
 dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms. Precipitates obtained contained Cu, Ni and Zn, 
indicating absorption and/or co-precipitation with Fe(III)(hydr)oxides.  
 
7.2.4 Evaluation of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification in continuous flow 
packed-bed reactors 
In this study, the highest nitrate removal rates and efficiency were observed at the 
highest feed nitrate concentration, in contrast with what was reported by the only two studies 
on the continuous-flow application of Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic denitrification (Zhang et 
al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016). The biofilm used in this study was longer enriched on Fe(II) and 
was capable of reaching a higher nitrate removal at higher influent nitrate concentrations. 
Furthermore, the addition of EDTA likely prevented cell encrustation by the Fe(III) 
hydroxide mineral formation, allowing the activity of microbes (Shelobolina et al., 2003; 
Chakraborty et al., 2011). 
At the steady state, nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation were 86.0 ±2.0% and 
95.5±2.5%, respectively, in PBR1, wher eas 65.5±3.5% and 70.0±2.0%, in PBR2. The lower 
initial feed nitrate concentration resulted in a lower efficiency in PBR2. The effluent pH 
decrease did not affect the performance of the process.  The lowest HRT used was 20 h, as 
other studies on continuous flow experiments that reported a minimum HRT in the range 18-
24 h (Zhang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016). However, the operation of the two PBRs needs 
further investigation as the process has the potential to tolerate even lower HRT values. 
Finally, if compared to other denitrification processes, Fe(II) driven autotrophic 
denitrification showed quite high efficiencies. For instance, nitrate removal rates during 
sulfur-driven autotrophic denitrification have been reported to be in the range 50-560 mg 
NO 3-/(L·d) and heterotrophic denitrification with ethanol resulted in nitrate removal rates of 
approximately 400 mg NO 3-/(L·d) (Park and Yoo, 2009; Show et al., 2013 Papirio et al., 
2014 ). 
 
7.3 Future research perspectives 
Based on the results obtained during the various batch and continuous flow 
experiments that were conducted during this study, Fe(II) mediated autotrophic 
denitrification resulted in fairly high nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation efficiencies 
compared to other denitrification processes. However, several aspects still remain to be  
174 
 properly assembled and optimized before an efficient configuration at bench-, pilot- and full -
scale.  
Improvements are especially needed on the investigation of other microorganisms 
capable for the process. Results showed that all four microbial cultures were capable for the 
process after longer enrichment in Fe(II). Microorganisms have been isolated from various 
habitats, such as freshwater and saline environments, paddy soils, ponds, streams, ditches, 
brackish lagoons, lake sediments, wetlands, aquifers, hydrothermal and deep-sea sediments 
(Weber et al., 2006; Hedrich et al., 2011) and, therefore, the potential of these microbes is 
still an aspect that has to be deepened.  
The investigation of the operating parameters affecting Fe(II)-mediated autotrophic 
denitrification indicated that nitrate removal and Fe(II) oxidation are markedly hindered at 
pH lower than 6. Most of the mining waters and acid mine drainage are extremely acidic. 
Therefore, a direct application of Fe(II)-driven denitrification to these waters, without 
preliminary adjusting the pH, can be of high scientific interest.  
Despite the current expectations and efforts made in improving the effect of 
EDTA:Fe(II) ratio, EDTA showed to be inhibitory for denitrifiers. Further investigation of 
other possible chelating agent should be conducted.  NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) showed to be 
less inhibitory in nitrate-dependent ferrous oxidizers (Shelobolina et al., 2003). Furthermore, 
the use of humic substances as chelating agents has been poorly investigated (Kumaraswamy 
et al. 2006; Larese-Casanova et al., 2010). Another aspect, which was not investigated in this 
study, is the recycling of EDTA. The use of EDTA results in increasing treatment costs, but 
EDTA can be effectively recycled and suitable for reuse without losing its chelating 
properties (Juang and Wang, 2000; Di Palma et al., 2003). An EDTA-recycling step after 
denitrification can be an interesting option to enhance the economic feasibility of the overall 
process (Zeng et al., 2005). Design of suitable bioreactor for nitrate removal and Fe(II) 
oxidation with EDTA-recycling step is an important research perspective. 
During this study part of the heavy metals co-precipitates with Fe(III) (hydr)oxides 
and this can be an important application for the recovery of the products of Fe(II)-mediated 
autotrophic denitrification. Further research on the effect of single metals and a mixture of 
them is required, as Fe co-occurs with several metals in real wastewaters.  
Moreover, further continuous-flow experiments should be performed in order to 
reduce the HRT. Then, the operation of bioreactors should be performed with real 
wastewaters.   
175 
 Finally, detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis of the 
whole process, including an environmental impact assessment, need to be performed in order 
to better evaluate the real efficiency of Fe(II) mediated autotrophic denitrification
