A nanocrystal catalyst Ag/ZnO was successfully synthesized using a simple solvothermal
method in this study. This catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that this catalyst was composed
of metallic Ag and ZnO. The photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) was investigated in
aqueous suspension containing Ag/ZnO catalyst under UV irradiation. Liquid chromatogra-
phy coupled with electrospray ionization ion-trap mass spectrometry was applied to the
analysis of the samples coming from the photocatalytic degradation of MO. The experimental
results showed that there were four intermediates existing in the photocatalytic reaction. MO
could be mineralized in the Ag/ZnO suspension after 60 min illumination. (J Am Soc Mass

In the past decades, photocatalytic techniques have
been shown to constitute one of the most promising
processes for the wastewater treatment because of
its advantages over the traditional techniques, such as
quick oxidation, no formation of polycyclic products,
and oxidation of pollutants up to the parts per billion
(ppb) level. Methyl orange (MO) is an azo dye and has
been widely used in textiles, foodstuffs, paper, and
leather industries. However, the release of MO and its
products in the environment cause serious pollution
problems. The photocatalytic treatment of wastes con-
taining dyes has also been widely reported [1–7] . ZnO
has attracted much attention with respect to the degra-
dation of various pollutants because of its high photo-
sensitivity, stability, and wide band gap. Previous stud-
ies have proved that ZnO can degrade some organic
pollutants under UV irradiation [8–11] . However, the
fast recombination rate of the photo-generated electron
and hole pairs may decrease the photocatalytic activity.
The combination of transition metals (such as silver,
platinum, and iron) and semiconductor has been re-
ported to improve the charge-transfer and photocata-
lytic activity [12, 13]. However, to the best of our
knowledge, there were only a few published reports onAg/ZnO photocatalysts [14, 15]. They reported the
photochemical degradation of lignin, dye, and paper
effluent by using Ag-doped ZnO photocatalysts. The
degradation process was monitored by UV-Vis spectrom-
etry in the works. Although the residual organic pollut-
ants could be determined by UV-Vis spectrometry, it was
difficult to identify the degradation intermediates.
The intermediates of dyes may be more toxic than
the parent compound. Therefore, it is necessary to
identify the degradation products. Recently, liquid
chromatography separation techniques coupling with
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been established for
separation and detection of dyes and their degradation
products [16–20] . In connection with soft ionization
techniques, ion-trap mass spectrometry is essential for
identification and structural elucidation of dyes.
Some photocatalysts have been used in the photocat-
alytic degradation of MO [1–4] , although the photocat-
alytic activity of these catalysts was limited and the
degradation products were not investigated in detail.
The aim of our work is to synthesize the Ag/ZnO
nanocatalysts with higher photocatalytic activity, and
MO was adopted as a compound to evaluate thephotocatalytic performance of Ag/ZnO catalyst. MOhas poor stability and low volatility, and we consideredthat liquid chromatography coupling with ion-trapmass spectrometry (LC-IT-MS) was a suitable analyticalapproach for the identification and determination of

it is innovative for us to synthesize the nanostructuredAg/ZnO photocatalysts using a solvothermal method;the residual MO and degradation products are deter-mined by LC-IT-MS. The photocatalytic activity ofAg/ZnO photocatalysts provides a simple and effectivetechnique for wastewater treatment. In the presentwork, the photocatalytic degradation of MO dye underUV irradiation was investigated over nanosized Ag/ZnO photocatalysts. We expect that this photocatalytictechnique can be applied to the treatment of wastewaterin the future.
Experimental
Chemicals
HPLC-grade acetonitrile was purchased from Merck (Darm-stadt, Germany). Methyl orange (4-[[(4-dimethylamino)
phenyl]-azo] benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt) andammonium acetate (Shanghai Chemical Reagents,Shanghai, China) was analytical reagent-grade. Dis-tilled water was deionized in a Milli-Q SP ReagentWater System (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). All thesolvents were passed through a 0.45
/H9262m cellulose filter
before use.
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
An Agilent 1100 series LC system (Agilent Technolo-gies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was performed with a binarypump, 1100 UV-Vis diode array detector, an autosam-pler, and a column thermostat. The LC-MS system wasequipped with a Zorbax C
18column (150 /H110034.6 mm i.d.,
5/H9262m). The solvent used as mobile phase was acetoni-
trile: 0.01 M ammonium acetate (pH 6.8) /H1100530:70
(vol/vol). The flow rate was 0.6 mL min/H110021, and 20 /H9262Lo f
standard or sample solution was injected.
The isocratic HPLC separation was coupled with
LC/MSD Trap XCT ion-trap mass spectrometer (Agi-lent Technologies). The mass spectrometer wasequipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) sourceand operated at negative polarity. The ESI conditionswere as follows: capillary voltage, 3.5 kV; the endplateoffset was fixed at /H11002500 V; capillary exit, 100 V;
nebulizer pressure, 40 psi; drying gas flow, 10 L min
/H110021;
temperature, 350 °C. The mass range was from 100 to
400m/z.
Synthesis
Ag/ZnO nanocatalyst was synthesized by a simple
solvothermal method described by Zheng et al. [21].
A certain concentration of Zn(Ac)2·2 H2O and
CH3COOAg was mixed in a Teflon tank of 50 mL
capacity. Then, 30 mL of a NaOH/ethanol solution (0.17
M) was added into the tank drop by drop with agita-tion. The tank was moved to a stainless steel autoclave,put into an oven, and heated at 160 °C for 24 h. Whenthe reactions were completed, the autoclave was natu-
rally cooled to room temperature. The brown-red pre-cipitates were collected by filtration, washed withdeionized water and ethanol several times, and finallydried in the air at 60 °C for 10 h.
Degradation Experiment
For degradation experiment, 30 mg of the catalyst wassuspended in 90 mL of a standard methyl orange (MO)aqueous solution (5.0 /H1100310
/H110025M), and then the mixture
was charged to a quartz tube and agitated overnight in
the absence of light. UV irradiation was carried outusing a 4 /H110034 W fluorescent Hg lamp (Philips TUV 4 W
with the maximum emission wavelength at 254 nm).Light intensity near the solution surface was about 150mW/cm
2. After a given irradiation time, about 3.5 mL
of the mixture was withdrawn and the catalysts were
separated from the suspensions by filtration through0.22
/H9262m cellulose membranes.
Results and Discussion
Catalytic Characterization of Ag/ZnO
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the synthesizedsample is shown in Figure 1 a. It can be seen that there
are two sets of strong diffraction peaks in Figure 1 a,
indicating that the synthesized product is a compositematerial with high crystallinity. Those marked with “#”can be indexed to hexagonal wurtzited ZnO (JCPDS fileno. 36-1451), whereas the others marked with “*” can beindexed to face-center-cubic (fcc) metallic Ag (JCPDSfile no. 04-0783), and no other crystalline impuritieswere observed.
To obtain detailed information about the microstruc-
ture and morphology of the synthesized sample, trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out.The result is shown in Figure 1 b. A low-magnification
TEM image of this sample (see Figure 1 b) shows a high
yield of Ag/ZnO hetero-structure nanocrystals consist-ing of metallic Ag nanoparticles (highlighted by circles)and ZnO nanorods. Most of the Ag nanoparticles andZnO nanorods in Figure 1 b are about 9 nm in diameter
and 18 nm in width, respectively. Additionally, one cansee that all nanoparticles are attached to nanorods.Although there are some ZnO nanorods without Agnanoparticles on the surface, self-nucleated and isolatedsilver nanoparticles are hardly observed. Moreover, Agaggregates are also not found in our TEM observations,indicating that all metallic Ag nanoparticles are welldispersed in ZnO nanorods.
Control Experiments for the Photodegradation
Preliminary control experiments conducted in the ab-sence of Ag/ZnO catalyst showed that less than 1.0%MO was decomposed afte r1hU V irradiation, indicat-
ing that MO has a good photostability under the UV998 CHEN ET AL. J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2008, 19, 997–1003light irradiation. When there was no UV light irradia-
tion, the concentration of MO with the addition ofAg/ZnO catalyst kept stable in 1 h. Therefore, UV lightirradiation and catalyst are the necessary factors in thephotocatalytic process.
Determination of MO Residues
The fragment ions of MO are produced by tandem massspectrometry (MS/MS) experiments, where the MOprecursor ion is isolated first by the mass analyzer, thenthe collision activation of this ion is performed yieldingthe fragment ions. The MS/MS of MO increases thespecificity of detection because there is no uncertaintyin the product ion spectrum.
The parent molecule of methyl orange provides a
signal corresponding to a negative ion at m/z304 [M /H11002
H]
/H11002[22]. The MS/MS spectrum of this ion gives three
significant m/zvalues: 289.0, 240.2, and 156.1 (see Figure
2). The ion at m/z289.0 was derived from the cleavage
of one methyl group. The ion at m/z240.2 was derived
from the cleavage of a sulfonate group. The ion at m/z
156.1 corresponds to [M /H11002H/H11002N2C6H4N(CH3)2]/H11002. Thesum of MS/MS product ions at m/z 289.0, 240.2, and
156.1 was for the determination of MO residues.
Figure 3 shows the change of MO residues in the
presence of Ag/ZnO, which is used as the catalystunder irradiation. The plot of ln(C
0/C) (where C0is
initial concentration of the methyl orange and C is the
concentration at a given moment of time) against irra-diation time shows that the photocatalytic degradationof methyl orange is a pseudo-first-order reaction. Theconfirmation of the first-order rate kinetics was derivedfrom the linearity of the plot. The rate constant fordegradation of MO is 1.9 /H1100310
/H110021min/H110021.
Determination of the Photodegradation Products
Figure 4 shows the total ion chromatograms of methyl
orange being degraded for 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60min, respectively. As can be seen from Figure 4 that for
0 min, there are three small peaks of m/z196, 290, and
320, except for a strong peak at m/z304 corresponding
to MO. The peak of m/z196 always exists in the course
of photodegradation of MO for 60 min; perhaps itbelongs to the impurity in the MO solution. The peak of

m/z304.999 J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2008, 19, 997–1003 PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION OF MO IN WATER USING Ag/ZnOm/z 290 can be attributed to the loss of one methyl
group from MO (see Figure 8 below). The MS/MS
spectrum of ion at m/z 290 yields the fragment ions
corresponding to [M /H11002H/H11002SO2]/H11002atm/z226, [M /H11002H
/H11002CH3]/H11002atm/z275, and [M /H11002H/H11002N2C6H4NHCH3]/H11002at
m/z156 (see Figure 5 b). The compound of m/z320 is the
monohydroxylated product of methyl orange (see Fig-
ure 8 ). The MS/MS spectrum of ion at m/z320 yields the
fragment ions corresponding to [M /H11002H/H11002SO2]/H11002atm/z
256 and [M /H11002H/H11002N2C6H3(OH)N(CH3)2]/H11002atm/z 156
(see Figure 5 d). Since these peaks exist in the samples
before UV irradiation, they may be attributed to thelimited degradation of MO by the room light during theLC-MS operating procedures.
After 10 min irradiation, it is found that two new
peaks ( m/z276 and 306) are clearly observed (see Figure
4). The parent molecule with m/z304 loses two methyl
groups corresponding to m/z 276 (see Figure 8 ). The
MS/MS spectrum of ion at m/z276 yields the fragment
ions corresponding to [M /H11002H/H11002SO
2]/H11002atm/z212 and
[M/H11002H/H11002N2C6H4NH2]/H11002atm/z156 (see Figure 5 a). The
compound of m/z306 can be attributed to the oxidation
in the aromatic ring and loses one methyl group fromnitrogen atom of amino group (see Figure 8 ). The
MS/MS spectrum of ion at m/z306 yields the fragment
ions corresponding to [M /H11002H/H11002SO
2]/H11002atm/z242 and
[M/H11002H/H11002N2C6H3(OH)NHCH3]/H11002atm/z156 (see Figure 5 c).
As can been seen from Figure 4 that after 20 min
irradiation, MO and its degradation products exhibitmuch smaller peaks compared with those after 10 minirradiation. MO scarcely exists after 30 min irradiation,
but some degradation products are still present at thistime. After 40 and 50 min irradiations, degradationproducts of MO subsequently decrease without forma-tion of new products. We did not find any degradationproducts through the LC-MS technique after 60 min UVirradiation. The photocatalytic activity of Ag/ZnO cat-alyst is much higher than that of other catalysts, such asTiO
2, Ag/InVO4–TiO2, Ag/SiO2, CdS, and Fe/TiO2[1,
23–27] . They reported that MO still existed in thesolution after 60 min UV irradiation. MO did not exist
in the solution after 60 min UV irradiation with Ag/ZnO catalyst.
UV Absorbance Spectra of the
Photodegradation Intermediates
Figure 6 shows the UV spectra for the compounds with
molecular weights MW /H11005276, 290, 306, 304, and 320
determined on the basis of [M /H11002H]/H11002ions in the spectra.
The UV-Vis spectrum of the compounds with molecular
weights MW /H11005276 and 290 shows that the maximum
absorption wavelength is a slight blue-shift comparedwith that of MO, indicating that there is still a chro-mophore group in this intermediate. Considering thatthe methyl group can easily separate from the dimeth-ylamine group, we think that products with molecularweights MW /H11005276 and 290 are produced by homolytic
breaking of the nitrogen–carbon bond, resulting in thesubstitution of the methyl group by the hydrogen atom.
The UV-Vis spectrum of the compound with molec-
ular weights MW /H11005320 shows a significant red-shift
compared with that of MO. This red-shift may beattributed to the hydroxyl radical inserted in the ortho
position of the benzene ring linking with the dimethyl-amine group of MO. A red-shift of the maximal absorp-tion peak of UV-Vis spectra was observed because ahydroxyl group connected with the chromophoregroup. On the contrary, the dealkylation could lead tothe significant wavelength blue-shift. The UV-Vis spec-trum of the compound with molecular weights MW /H11005
306 shows a significant blue-shift compared with that ofthe compound with molecular weights MW /H11005320,
because the compound with molecular weights MW /H11005
306 can be attributed to the loss of one methyl groupfrom the compound with molecular weights MW /H11005320.

On the basis of the preceding discussion, it can be
concluded that: (1) ZnO nanorods serve as an electronand hole source (see eq 1) for degradation of organicdye; when semiconductor nanocrystals are irradiatedby UV light with energy higher than or equal to theband gap of ZnO nanocrystals, an electron (e
/H11002)i nt h e
valence band (VB) can be excited to the conduction
band (CB) with simultaneous generation of a hole (h/H11001)
in the VB; (2) oxygen vacancy defects (see Vo˙ and Vo¨i n
eqs 2 and 3) and Ag nanoparticles on the surface of ZnO
nanorods act as a sink for the electrons (see eqs 4 and 6)and improve the separation of electron–hole pairs gen-erated in eq 1; (3) the photoelectron can be easilytrapped by electronic acceptors like adsorbed O
2,t o
further produce a superoxide radical anion (·O2/H11002) (see
eq 5). The photoinduced holes can be easily trapped by
OH/H11002to further produce a hydroxyl radical species
(·OH) (see eq 7); the generated superoxide anion radical
(·O2/H11002) and hydroxyl radical species (·OH) determine the
overall photocatalytic reaction; for example, ·OH is an
extremely strong oxidant for the partial or completemineralization of organic chemicals [30].
On the basis of the preceding experimental results,
we propose the chemical structure of the photocatalyticdegradation products for MO (see Figure 8 ). Four major
compounds appeared during the photocatalytic process.
They come from the demethylation and hydroxylationof MO.
Conclusions
Ag/ZnO nanocatalysts with excellent photocatalyticperformance were successfully prepared using a sim-ple solvothermal method in this study, which hasshown that photocatalytic degradation of MO can bereadily performed in the presence of Ag/ZnO in anaqueous suspension system, leading to the completemineralization of the dye. The required time for an
entire degradation of MO using Ag/ZnO catalysts isless than 60 min, much shorter than the correspond-ing value by using other catalysts. The structures ofthe intermediates formed during the photocatalyticprocess are based mainly on demethylation and hy-droxylation.
