1. Introduction  
 
Phenol and its derivatives have been 
widely used in different areas as in veterinary 
medicine, refinery, construction, automotive 
and appliance industries.1 In spite of its 
important applications, phenol represents a 
meaningful threat to environment due to its 
toxicity and ability to remain in the 
environment for long periods, compromising 
aqueous systems.2 For these reasons, removal of phenol from water bodies is a 
very important task.3-5 
Advanced oxidation processes, AOP´s, 
have been widely studied for the abatement 
of recalcitrant substances, just as phenol, by 
a simple low cost system, based on hydroxyl 
radicals.6-7 AOP´s include, among others, 
homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton 
processes. In spite of being widely studied in 
recent years, homogeneous Fenton systems 
have important drawbacks as the use of 
acidic media to promote reaction and sludge Souza, J. J. N. et al. 
 
 
Rev. Virtual Quim. |Vol 9|  |No. 6|  |no prelo| 000 
 
formation, which is difficult to remove. These 
drawbacks may be overcome by the use of 
heterogeneous Fenton systems.8-9 
In addition to the iron oxides directly used 
as Fenton catalysts, iron has also been 
incorporated onto different materials. For 
instance, two reviews were published in 
2010, reporting the incorporation of iron 
onto materials as zeolites, mesoporous 
silicas, clays and pillared clay s.9-11 Moreover, 
recent researches show the application of 
gamma-alumina impregnated with iron oxide 
by wetness impregnation method, for the 
Fenton degradation of phenol and derivatives 
in aqueous media.12-14 Fe (II) compound was 
deposited onto mesoporous Al2O3,15 while 
impregnated Fe 2O3 onto mesoporous gamma-
Al2O3,16 both used for phenol degradation by 
Fenton reactions with a high efficiency. 
Recently, Fe 2O3/Al 2O3 and Fe 2O3/CuO/Al 2O3 
catalysts were prepared by ultrasonic 
impregnation and obtained a high 
conversion, especially for the CuO containing 
catalyst.17 
In the present work, iron was 
incorporated into alumina lattice, by a doping 
process using the modified Pechini method.18-
19 The use of doping instead of impregnation 
was chosen in order to decrease the risk of 
iron leaching, as iron replaces aluminum 
inside the unit cell. The synthesized materials 
were applied for phenol degradation by a 
heterogeneous Fenton catalysis. 
 
2. Experimental  
 
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of 
catalysts 
 
Catalysts composed of pure and Fe-doped 
Al2O3 were obtained by the modified-Pechini 
method.20 During synthesis, Fe or Al solutions 
were prepared using Citric acid (Cargill, 
99.5%), Iron nitrate (Synth, 99.1%) and 
Aluminum nitrate (Vetec, 99%) as precursors, 
respectively. These solutions were added into 
a citric acid solution in order to obtain a molar ratio citric acid:metal of 3:1 and Fe-
doping amounts of 5 % (Fe5) and 10 % 
(Fe10). Ethylene glycol was added at the end 
of the synthesis with a mass ration citric acid: 
ethylene glycol of 3:2. The resin was heat 
treated at 350 oC for 2 h in order to obtain 
the precursor powders, which were milled in 
a Spex mill for 10 min and passed through a 
100 mesh sieve. The milled powder precursor 
was heat treated in oxygen atmosphere at 
300 oC for 12 h and subsequently in 
stagnated air atmosphere with a heating rate 
of 10 oC.min-1 up to 1000 oC for 4 h. The pure 
Al2O3 powder precursor was also heat treated 
at 1100 oC using the same conditions (Al 2O3-
1100). 
Samples were characterized by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) by a XRD-6000 
diffractometer (Shimadzu), using K α Cu 
radiation. Infrared spectra (IR) were obtained 
in a spectrometer (Shimadzu), using KBr 
pellets. Composition was evaluated in a EDX-
7000 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer 
(Shimadzu). Surface area was determined by 
a BELSORP II-MINI equipment from BEL 
JAPAN. UV-visible spectra were obtained in a 
2550 spectrometer (Shimadzu) in the range 
from 190 to 900 nm.  
 
2.2. Catalytic test 
 
The catalysts were tested in the phenol 
oxidation in aqueous solution at pH = 3, 
heated at 70 oC, using a 50 mL reactor 
connected to a condenser. Catalysts were 
added into 20 mL of a phenol solution with a 
concentration of 250 ppm and 0.5 mL of H 2O2 
(30% v/v), according to di Luca and 
collaborators (2015).16 Tests were realized 
using 20, 10, 5 and 1 mg of catalysts, with 
duration varying from 1 to 4 h. A blank tested 
was realized using phenol (Sigma-Aldrich, 
99%) and H 2O2 solutions, without the 
catalysts.21 
Further tests were performed by varying 
the phenol concentrations, using 1000, 500 
and 125 ppm, in the reaction time of 4 hours. 
The degradation of phenol in alkaline (pH =   Souza, J. J. N. et al.  
  
 
000 Rev. Virtual Quim. |Vol 9|  |No. 6|  |XXX| 
 
11) and neutral media was also evaluated. 
Hydrogen peroxide consumption was 
evaluated through UV-Vis spectrophotometry 
using acidic ammonium metavanadate, which 
reacts with H 2O2 to form the red-orange 
peroxovanadium cation, detected at the 
wavelength of 450 nm.24 
 
2.3. Phenol quantification  
 
Phenol degradation was initially 
monitored by the Folin-Ciocalteu method,22 
applied in the determination of total 
phenolics. This method uses the Folin-
Ciocalteu reagent, which consists of a 
mixture of phosphomolybdic and 
phosphotungstic acids, with a yellow 
coloration. In the presence of reducing 
agents, the change in coloration to blue 
occurs, directly proportional to the 
concentration of the reducing substances, in 
this case, phenolic compounds. UV-visible 
absorbance was measured at 765 nm and 
phenol concentration was calculated using 
the previously determined calibration curve. 
Phenol quantification was determined by 
the high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC), using the separation method (LC- 20 
AT, Shimadzu Corporation, Japão), equipped 
with a C18 coluŵŶ (SUPELCOSIL™ LC -PAH 
HPLC Column, 250 x 4,6 mm, particle size 5 
μm, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, EUA) and a 
UV-visible detector (Rheodyne, EUA), in 
agreement to the previous methodology.23 
 
3. Results and discussion  
 
3.1. Synthesis and Characterization of the 
Catalyst 
 
Figure 1 shows the DRX of the samples, 
indicate that pure Al 2O3 calcined at 1000 oC presents gamma and alpha phases, in 
agreement to the index cards ICDD 50-0741 
and 42-1468, respectively, while Al 2O3-1100 
presents only the -Al2O3 phase, as well as 
Fe-doped samples (Fe5 and Fe10), with a 
small displacement of peaks to smaller 
angles. This behavior may be explained by 
the Fe3+ larger ionic radii (65 pm) comparing 
to Al3+ one (54 pm), both in octahedral site.25 
Secondary phases were not observed, 
indicating that iron got into the alumina 
lattice. 
This behavior is in agreement with authors 
who reported the formation of -Al2O3 after 
calcinations at and above 1100 oC, which 
decrease to lower temperatures due to the 
presence of impurities in the material that 
change the phase transformation barrier.26 
The experimental doping amount was 
evaluated by XRF, using the internal 
standards of the equipment. For the 5 % 
doped sample, 4.8 % of Fe was found in the 
final sample, while 9.6 % was found for the 
10 % doped sample. These results indicated 
that a satisfactory result was attained, with a 
good stoichiometric control.  
The infrared spectra of all of the samples 
are presented in Figure 2. According to 
literature data,27 -Al2O3 presents absorption 
bands assigned to the Al-O bonds of AlO 4 
groups (around 750 cm-1) and AlO 6 groups 
(around 615 and 490 cm-1). In the present 
work, Al 2O3 presents bands around 466, 553, 
733 and 814 cm-1. 
For -Al2O3 samples, literature data 
indicates bands at about 650, 600 cm-1, and 
nearby 450 and 780 cm-1, assigned to Al- O 
bond in octahedral coordination, AlO 6.28 In 
the present work, these bands were 
observed at about 429, 581 and 630 cm-1 for 
Al2O3-1100 and Fe-doped samples. These 
results are in agreement to XRD patterns, 
which indicated the formation of -Al2O3 for 
the pure sample calcined at 1000 oC and -
Al2O3 for the pure sample calcined at 1100 oC 
as well as for the Fe-doped samples.

UV-vis spectra of all samples are 
presented in Figure 3. Electronic transitions 
may also be observed in the UV-vis spectra. 
Fe3+ containing materials have three types of electronic transitions: (i) ligand-metal charge 
transfer; (ii) d-d transitions; (iii) pair 
excitations resulting from simultaneous 
excitations of two neighbouring Fe3+ cations

that are magnetically coupled.29 In the 
present work, the band at 250-400 nm was 
assigned to superposed ligand-metal charge 
transfers (Al-O and Fe-O) and Fe3+ d-d transitions; the band at 450-600 nm was 
assigned to pair excitation processes; the 
band at 650-800 nm was related to 
transitions of the Fe3+ ligand field.

The band gap of the samples was 
calculated according to Wood and Tauc 
method. Pure Al 2O3 samples presented values 
of 2.8 and 3.5 eV for samples calcined at 
1000 and 1100 oC, respectively. Fe-doped 
samples presented band gap values around 2 
eV, indicating a possible use of these 
materials as photocatalysts sensitive to 
visible electromagnetic radiation. 
Specific surface areas (S BET) of samples 
were measured using the BET method. For 
pure Al 2O3 calcined at 1000 oC, S BET was 19.9 
m2.g-1, while Fe-doped samples presented 
similar S BET values, of 5.7 and 5.4 m2.g-1 for 5 
and 10 % doping, respectively.  
 3.2. Catalytic test and Phenol 
quantification  
 
The first catalytic tests were realized at 70 
oC for 4 h and quantified by the Folin-
Ciocalteu method (Figure 4). Fe-doping leads 
to an improvement of the catalytic activity 
for phenol degradation, with a 5.5-fold 
increase for 10 % of Fe-doping and 5.8-fold 
increase for 5 % of doping, compared with 
non-doped material (Al 2O3). This is a unusual 
result, especially considering that -Al2O3 has 
been the most used alumina phase applied as 
support for Fe 2O3 in previous works.30 The α - 
Al2O3 was used as support for Fe 2O3 and 
presented similar results.31

Figure 4 . Phenol degradation after Fenton test, using 20 mg of the catalysts and 4 h of 
reaction. Quantification by Folin-Ciocalteu method 
 
In relation to undoped alumina, two 
samples were evaluated -Al2O3, calcined at 
the same temperature of the doped samples 
and -Al2O3, which presents the same 
crystalline phase of the doped samples. As 
expected, both presented a very small 
activity. 
The doped materials exhibited similar 
catalytic activity and Fe5 was used in the 
posterior catalytic tests, with evaluation by 
HPLC. Figure 5 presents the Fenton tests 
done using 20 mg of catalyst ranging from 1 
to 4 h. Results showed a high activity even in 
the first hours of reaction with almost 100 % 
of degradation of 4 h, similarly to results 
obtained in literature, who used Fe 2O3 supported on mesoporous -Al2O3, a material 
with very high surface area.16 
A blank test (phenol + H 2O2, without 
catalyst) showed low phenol degradation (7% 
after 4 hours of reaction), suggesting that the 
H2O2 decomposition occurs mainly on the 
surface of the material (Fe5 catalyst), since in 
the first hour of reaction, the phenol 
concentration was reduced to 94%, due to 
the consumption of approximately 20% of 
the initial H 2O2, and consequently the phenol 
degradation was associated to the initial 
consumption of H 2O2 (3%). the greatest 
amount of OH radicals.21 The maximum 
phenol breakdown was obtained in the time 
of 4h, close to 100%, which is linked to the 
increase in H 2O2 consumption (47%).

Figure 5 . Phenol degradation and H 2O2 Consumption using 20 mg of the Fe5 catalyst and 
reaction periods ranging from 1 to 4 h. Quantification by HPLC and UV-Vis spectroscopy 
 
Comparison between quantification of 
degradation obtained by the Folin-Ciocalteu 
method and by HPLC for Fe5 catalyst after 4 h 
showed close results, indicating that the first 
one may be used as a good indicator to 
monitor phenol degradation.32 
The influence of the catalyst amount on 
the phenol degradation was also evaluated 
for Fe5, for periods of 4 h and quantification 
by HPLC, as displayed in Figure 6. According to these results, even a small amount of 
material (1 mg) leads to a high activity 
around 60 % of conversion. 
Phenol degradation, after 4 hours of 
reaction, for solutions with different initial 
concentrations were tested using 20 mg of 
Fe5 catalyst. The results presented in Table 1 
show that this degradation remained around 
99% or higher.

The importance of the acidic pH in the 
degradation of phenol was evidenced by 
tests carried out in alkaline medium (20.3% 
phenol degradation) and in neutral medium 
(26% phenol degradation). 
The reuse of the Fe5 catalyst was also 
evaluated and the same efficiency was 
observed even after the third Fenton test, 
with the same material. The degradation 
amount of 99 % was attained using the same 
initial mass (20 mg) after 4 h. 
After the Fenton test, the catalyst was 
evaluated by XRF, in order to evaluate the Fe 
leaching from the material. Results indicated the same Fe amount before and after test, 
confirming the high stability of the material. 
This result confirms that Fe incorporation as 
dopant into the alumina lattice consists in an 
interesting strategy for Fenton reaction, 
avoiding the risk of leaching as observed in 
literature,31 who obtained 100 % of phenol 
conversion using Fe 2O3/α-Al2O3, however 
with 21 % of leaching of the active phase. 
The rate of phenol consumption by mass 
of catalyst was calculated, as described by 
the equation 1: 
 
  Souza, J. J. N. et al.  
  
 
000 Rev. Virtual Quim. |Vol 9|  |No. 6|  |XXX| 
 
−r=Nc .  %
t .  m Equation 1  
 
At where: (-r) is the global rate of phenol 
consumption; (Nc) is the number of moles; 
(%) is the percent degradation of phenol; (t) 
is the time in hours; (m) is the mass of the 
catalyst in grams. 
In this way, the phenol consumption rate 
calculated for Fe5 was 3.2 x 10-2 moles.g cat-
1.h-1, even with a small surface area, but 
presenting high chemical stability, since iron 
leaching in the material was not observed. 
 
4. Conclusion  
 
In this work, the use of Fe-doped -Al2O3 
as catalyst for phenol degradation using the 
Fenton process was successfully evaluated. A 
high efficiency was obtained using a relatively 
small time of reaction, with 90% of 
degradation after 2 h, according to HPLC 
results. Similar efficiencies were obtained 
after reuse for 3 times, with no Fe leaching 
from the material, indicating that a high 
stability was attained.
