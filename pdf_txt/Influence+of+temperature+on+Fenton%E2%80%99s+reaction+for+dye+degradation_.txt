ABSTRACT
Treatment of young landfill leachate, collected from municipal solid waste site of city of Konya, was
investigated byusingtheFenton process. The leachate itselfshowed the charact eristics of pH 7.25,
COD 38.2 gL-1and BOD 522gL-1. Ratio of BOD 5to CODwith0.58 indicat esthat leachate can be
defined young. Fenton oxidation of landfill leachate was expressed in two -stage process, where a
fast initial re action(H2O2/Fe2+)was followed by a much slower one ( H2O2/Fe3+).Overall kinetics can
be described by a second-order rate equation followed by zero -order one. The kinetic studies were
undertaken at the different temperatures and reaction rates increcesed by increasing temp erature.
The apparent kinet ic constants at 303 K are k = 3. 16 x10-3Lg-1min-1and k 0= 0,171 g L-1min-1,
respectively. Fenton reagents effectively degraded theleachate organics and most of the
degradation was completed within 30 minutes for alltemperatures .The performance of Fenton
process was not only presented as a COD removal but al so expressed as the amount of generated
sludge and its properties. Sludge properties were revealed with Capillary Suction Time (CST) and
Sludge Volume Index (SVI). The minimum CST value was obtained at the optimum molar ratio of
4.12 mol/mol and increasing temperature resulted in a positive effect on CST values. All SVI values
were significantly low which indicates thatsludgeitselfhad good settling properties.

1. INTRODUCTION
Solid waste landfill is the most common way to eli minate municipal solid waste and still has great
importance in waste management all overthe world. Leachate is one of the main problems in the
landfill sites due to its considerable amounts of organic matter, ammonia andtotal Kjeldahl nitrogen
(TKN), heavy metals, chlorinated organic compounds and inorganic salts.Therefore, Leachate
treatment is animportant issuethathas been undergoing for severalyears and a universal solution
has not been offeredyet.
There are several methods that can be used for thetreatment of leachate. Aerobic, anaerobic and
anoxic processes are some of the biological methods for leachate treatment and usually used
together (Agdag and Sponza 2005; Castillo et al.,2007; Yilmaz et al.,2012).Air stripping and
adsorption are major physical methods wh ereas coagulation, flocculation and chemical oxidation are
chemical treatment onesespecially effective for COD removal from landfill leachate (Dercoet al.,
2010;Morais and Zamora ,2005; Trebouet et al.,2001;Yilmazet al.,2010a;Ilhanet al.,2008;Pala
and Erden, 2004 ).Because of high pollutant concentration in leachate ,a single meth od is not
sufficient to meet the standards for discharging into the sewer systemorthereceiving body. The
methods often require combined techniques which are designed as modular or multistage units
depending on the treatment of pollutants which vary in concentration over the years. The Solid
Waste Control Act of Turkey requires that leachates shouldbe collected and treated properly in
order to protecttheground and surface waters. Since the characteristics of leachate depend on the
nature of the waste on landfill, it is difficult to use a standard treatment method for all landfill488 AYGUN et al.
leachates. Therefore, leachate characterization has to be identified fortheselection of the
appropriate treatment method (Durmusoglu and Yilmaz, 2006).
Fenton process is one of the advanced oxidation processes whereiron and hydrogen peroxide are
major chemicals . Genera lly, Fenton ox idation process i s composed of four steps which are pH
adjustment, oxidation reaction, neutralization and coagulation, andprecipitation. The main factors
affecting the efficiency of the Fenton process can be summarized as reaction pH, dosages of
Fenton’s reagent, addition modes of reagents and temperature (Zhang et al.,2005).Fenton process
has been extensively studied in recent years and the results indicate this process to be one of the
most cost -effective alternatives for lea chate treatment (Wu et al.,2011).
This process produces ·OH radicals (a strong and nonselective oxidant) from catalytic H 2O2
decomposition by means of Fe2+at acidic pH. The overall mechanism also involves several
secondary reactions . These are regeneration of Fe2+by reaction betw een Fe3+and H 2O2and
competitive scavenging reactions involving Fe2+, H2O2, andOH (Zazo et al.,2011).Fenton reactions
are presented by (Eqs. 1 –9)in Table 1.

Reaction of Fenton oxidation is rather complex. It is difficult to use conventional kinetic approaches
to describe the degradation reaction of landfill leachate by using Fenton process due to landfill
leachate contain s plenty of soluble orgnic matters and inorganic ions athigh concentrations (L ema
etal.,1988).
Wuet al.,(2011)explained oxidation reaction kinetics for treatment of landfill leachate in Fenton
process. Fenton process reactions can be divi ded two stages, which a f ast stage was followed by a
much slower one in Fenton process. In the first reaction stage, al most all of the OH* is generated
and most of the Fe2+and H 2O2are consumed. The second reaction stage can be considered as a
series of Fenton -like reactions .Sothe use of a two -stage reaction is necessary to ge t a full picture of
the process (Wuet al.,2011).An appropriate understanding of Fenton reactions allows the
development of kinetic models to optimize the performance and efficiency of Fenton process.
Oneof the important factors is temperature on reaction ratio in kinetic studies. Operating
temperature likely increased the reaction rate between hydrogen peroxide and any form of
ferrous/ferric iron, thus increasing the rate of generation of oxidizing speci es (hydroxyl radicals or
highvalence iron species). Simultaneously, on the other hand, temperature also influences the
inefficient decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into inactive species (water and oxygen).
Guedes et al.(2003) reported that, the reaction rate was smaller at 293 K and the efficiency
continued to increase at 303 K. They also reported further increase of operating temperature will
result in significant ineffciency of H 2O2decomposition. However, Hermosilla et al. (2009), claims that
there wa s no significant increase in the COD removal when the temperature was increased from 298
to 318 K and COD removal results w ere constant at about 64%. Zazo et al.(2011) reported that
increasing operating temperature had possitive effect on the TOC reductio n. They found that TOC
reduction of alm ost 80% was achieved at 363 K. Beyond this temperature no significant
improvement was observed, although the rate of the process was considerably enhanced. As aEFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON FENTON OXIDATION 489
result of all this findings , effect of operating tempera ture on Fenton process performance due to the
idea of thermal decomposition of H 2O2into O 2and H 2O2has been so far scarcely investigated .
The reaction parameters affecting the COD and color removals such as the dosages of Fenton
reagents, initial pH have been discussed in our previous study (Yilmazet al.,2010b).The aim of this
study was to investigate the effect of temperature and reaction time on the performance of the
Fenton process. So far, the effect of temperature on reaction kinetics of leachate treated by Fenton
process has been scarcely investigated .The performance of Fenton process was not only presented
as a COD removal but also expressed as the amount of generated sludge and its properties. Sludge
properties were evaluated with CST and SVI.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.2. Analytical Methods
pH, COD, BOD 5,color, chlorine and alkalinity were analyzed in the la boratory usingStandard
Methods (APHA, AWWA, WEF ,2005). pH measurements were performed by using the WTW
Multiparameter 340i. Closed reflux titrimetric method (Method 5220.C ) was used for COD analysis.
BOD5, color, and alkalinity were analyzed by 5 -day BOD test (Method 5210), spectrophotometer
method (Method 2120.C) and titration method (Method 2320 B), respectively .COD, BOD 5, color
and alkalinity measurements were performed as three replicates. Heavy metals (Fe, Pb,
Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn) and Ca -Mg measurem ents were performed byusing the Perkinelmer Optima
2200 DV ICP -OES.
TheCSTtest determines therate of water release from sludge. It provides a quantity in seconds and
assesses howquickly the sludge releases its water. To avoid any possible errors CSTmeasurement
has been carried out fivetimesper sample and the average of the results was reported .SVIis
volume in milliliters occupied by 1 g of a suspension after 30 min settling whichis used to monitor
settling characteristics of sludge.CST measurem ents (Method 2710.G) and SVI analyses (Method490 AYGUN et al.
2710.D) were performed according to the method ssuggested by Standard Methods (APHA, AWWA,
WEF,2005).
2.3.Experimental Procedure
Batch experiments , in which jar test equipment was used for mixing and operate d at 120 rpm, were
set up in 500 mlbeakers.At predetermined time intervals, 5 ml of homogenized sample was taken
from the beakers. Sufficient amount of MnO2was added (Gucluet al.,2011)into thesesamples and
H2O2residual waschecked by using Test Str ips (Merck Merckoquant Peroxide Test) (Ustunet al.,
2007). pH was keptbetween 7.5and 8.0toprevent H 2O2interference onCOD analysi s.The
solutions were filtrated with 0.45 µm glass fiber filter and analyzed COD. Acidicand alkaline
conditions were pro vided using 3 M sulfuric acid and 10 M sodium hydroxide and checked with a pH -
meter. Granular ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4.7H2O), H2O2(35% w/w), manganese (IV) oxide, NaOH, and
H2SO498% of AR were supplied by Merck.
Optimum pH was 3 and Fenton reagents were d etermined as 2 gL-1Fe2+and 5gL-1H2O2in our
previous experimen t(Yilmazet al.,2010b).In order to the effect ofoperating temperatures (288,
293, 298 and 303 K)and reaction times (up to 120 min) on process performance a number of
experiments wereconducted. Allexperimental runs were performed at atmospheric preasure.
Properties of the Fentonsludge were reve aled with different H2O2/Fe2+molar ratios and different
temperature applicatio ns.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1.Effect of Reaction time
Theeffectsofdifferent reaction times and temperatures on Fenton process is illustratedin Figure 1.
Optimum COD removal (55.7%) was obtained at 30 min reaction time while the effl uent COD
decreased to 16.94 g L-1, when the temperature was 298 K. After 30 m in, the increase in the COD
removal efficiency became insignificant and only around 1% increase was observed .Zhanget al.
(2005) observed similar results and COD removal efficiency in their study was significant for the first
20 min.Therefore, the optimu m reaction time was set upas 30 min.
Figure 1.Evolution of the COD concentration for different reaction temperature
3.2. Effect of operating temperature on COD removal
Temperature is one of the important factor influencing catalytic oxidation reaction rates in Fenton.
Results show that COD removal efficiency, affected by temperature and increases by increasing
temperature. With an initial COD of 38.2 g L-1, COD removal efficiency rise from 35.3% to 61.1% by
increasing the temperature from 288 K to 303 K in the first 30 min. When the temperature increased
from 288 to 293 K, the COD removal efficiency was increased further 1 7.3%andincrease of
temperature from 293 to 303 K the COD removal efficiency wasincreased only 8.5%. Increasing
operating temperatu re had a favorable effect on the COD removal. Similar to our results, Zhang et
al.(2005), claims that COD removal efficiency in landfill leachate treatment increased from 31.6% to
44.8% as temperature increased from 288 to 308 K.EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON FENTON OXIDATION 491
3.3. Effect of operating temperature on reaction kinetic
Manystudies can be found in the literature related with the Fento n’s process kinetics. D ue to the
Fenton reaction complexity rate constants vary from studiestostudies(Ramirez et al.,2009).In
spite of the oxidation kin etics complexity, it is often assumed that, under certain conditions, the
process mechanism can be significantly simplified (Sunet al.,2007).
The decay of the landfill leachate was observed rapidly in thefirst 10 min forallreaction
temperature s. Thisisfollowed bya muchmore slow retardation stage, which was likely due to the
depletion of oxidants in the solution (see Figure 1). A number of researchers suggested that the
Fenton process should be a simple first -order reaction, while others believe th at itcouldbe a
second-order reaction. Degradation of organic matter in leachate Fenton’s process can be
considered in two-stage reactions .Thesestagesareillustrated inFigure 2A and 2B.
First stage (Fe2+/H2O2), which is faster than second one (Fe3+/H2O2) since ferrous ions react with
hydrogen peroxide. This is a well -known behavior; ferrous ions react very quickly with hydrogen
peroxide to produce large amounts of hydroxyl radicals (Malik and Saha, 2003). The rate of
oxidation, during the second stage, is slower than the one during first stage due to the slow
production of Fe2+from Fe3+(Ramirez et al.,2005).

in second stage
In order to determine t he oxidation kinetics of landfill leachate by Fenton Process, the kinetic
parameters we re studied for different reaction times from 1 to 10 min for thefirst stage reactions and
for thesecond stage reaction times ranging from10 to 30 min.
Statistically t he regression of the data, was conducted for zero order kinetic (Eq. 7), forthe first order
kinetic (Eq. 8) (Gulkaya et al.,2006)and forsecond ord er kinetic (Eq. 9 ) (Argunet al.,2010) attwo

Second order kinetic models provided better R2values than zero and first -order kinetic for first stage
of Fenton process while zero -order kinetic models possessed better results in second stage of
Fenton process. R2values for different temperature at both Fenton process stages are given in

Different reaction temperature swere chosen in order to investigat eits effects on the overall kinetics
and to allow the determination of the Arrhenius -type dependence of the kinetic constant k on the
temperature: The temperature dependence of the kinetic parameters of Fen ton treatmen t was
calculated by (Sun et al.,2009).

(Figure 5b) values of A and E acan be calculated as 465 g L-1min-1, 19.83 k Jmol-1, respectively.
Again temperature and kinetic constant are highlycorrelated (R2=0.87).

regarding how easy it is to separate the water portion from the sludge mixture. This test is very
effectively used to determine the optimum condition sfor dewatering.
The optimum mol ar ratio for this study was determined 4.12mol/mol Fe2+/H2O2whereCST reached
itsminimum value of21.5s. For all molar ratios ,SVI values were significantly low that they coul dbe

similar SVI values fortreatment ofcopper mine wastewater by Fenton process.

temperature. CST was 26.8 s at 288 Kwhereas it was 20.4 s at 303K.Furthermore, temperature
had positive effects on SVI values. TheSVI value of sludge decreased from16.63mlg-1to 13.69 ml
g-1by increasing thetemperature.
4. CONCLUSION
All the findings obtained from this investigation are summarized as below;
Organic matter was rapid ly degraded byFenton process . This degradation was generally
completed within 30 m inwith aCOD removal of55.7% at room temperature (298 K).
Temperature increase had positive effects onboth COD removal and thedewaterability of
sludge.The kinetic study carried out attemperature sranging from 288to303 K.
Overall kinetics could be described by a second -orderrate equation followed by zero -order
oneandatthe apparent kinetic constants at 303 K are k = 3. 16 x10-3Lg-1min-1and k 0=
0.171 gL-1min-1,respectively.
Corresponding Arrhenius -type plots, activation energy could be calculate d for second order
reaction (45.14 kJ mol-1) and zero order reaction (19.83 kJmol-1).
When the temperature was increased, CST values decreased. Decrease in CST values
indicatesthatthesludgehadtheability to be dewatered easily.
Regardless of the temperature and molar ratios ,theSVI values were low .Thus,itcan be
easilyconcluded that thesludge had good quality together with good settling properties in
landfillleachate treatment throughFenton process .
