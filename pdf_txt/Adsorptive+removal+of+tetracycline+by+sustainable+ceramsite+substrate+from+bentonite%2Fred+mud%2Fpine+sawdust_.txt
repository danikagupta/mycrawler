Introduction
Ceramsite are currently widely used as artificial 
water treatment filter media, since ceramsite have the 
characteristics of porosity, biocompatibility, and high 
strength, making them suitable as microbial carriers 
in the domestic wastewater treatment process [1-6]. 
Although sintered ceramsite have a macroscopic large 
pore structure but a relatively smooth microscopic 
surface, so there are almost no microporous and 
mesoporous structures on the surface of ceramsite [7, 8]. Therefore, the specific surface area of the original 
sintered ceramsite is relatively small, resulting in poor 
adsorption capacity, far lower than that of other filter 
medias such as zeolite and activated carbon [9-11].
In order to enhance the role of ceramsite in 
wastewater treatment, researchers have attempted 
to generate micro-porous structures on the surface 
of ceramsite to increase its specific surface area, 
adsorption capacity and loading capacity [11-17].  
The study by Chuan et al. [7, 18]. shows that the chemical 
activity of the internal phase of ceramsite have been 
increased during the high-temperature sintering process. 
Moreover, it was found that under alkaline hydrothermal 
conditions, the silicon and aluminum components inside 
ceramsite can be transformed into zeolite structures, Pol. J. Environ. Stud. Vol. 33, No. 2 (2024), 1455-1465

Abstract
In order to improve the adsorption capacity of waste-based ceramsite, this study proposed  
to use acid-alkali surface modification to enhance the adsorption capacity of ceramsite for heavy 
metals. In acid treatment, the ceramsite surface generated a composite pore structure, thus the specific 
surface area of ceramsite is significantly increased through acid treatment. In alkaline treatment, 
hydroxyl functional groups were loaded on the surface of the ceramsite, therefore the adsorption 
capacity for heavy metals was significantly improved. The surface of modified ceramic particles carries 
a negative charge, which is beneficial for the adsorption of cations. Taking lead ions as an example,  
the adsorption performance of ceramic particles on heavy metals was tested, and the maximum 
adsorption capacity reached 33.2 mg/g. Furthermore, the modified ceramic particles exhibit good 
desorption and regeneration properties. The modified ceramsite offers advantages in terms of raw 
material sources and production costs compared to natural zeolite.

thereby forming hierarchical pore structures on the 
surface and increasing its specific surface area and 
adsorption capacity. In subsequent studies, Zhang et al. 
[8, 19] analyzed the mechanism of zeolite crystallization 
on the surface of ceramsite. Furthermore, researchers 
have applied surface-zeolitized ceramsite in the removal 
of heavy metals or ammonia nitrogen from aqueous 
solutions, and the zeolitized modification by the alkaline 
hydrothermal process significantly increased the specific 
surface area and adsorption capacity of ceramsite, 
resulting in good removal effects [7, 8, 18-20]. However, 
the alkaline hydrothermal modification process requires 
a lengthy reaction time (typically exceeding 6 hours) and 
harsh reaction conditions (high temperature and high 
pressure). This result in high costs and low operability 
when applying the alkaline hydrothermal modification 
technology for ceramsite.
To address the issue of high costs and low 
operability of ceramsite hydrothermal modification 
mentioned above, the purpose of this study is to develop 
a new surface modification technology for ceramsite, 
which should be mild in reaction conditions and easy 
to implement. Based on the chemical composition and 
surface characteristics of ceramsite, a novel acid-alkali 
combined modification method is proposed for the first 
time. 
In recent years, extensive literature has reported 
the use of substances such as algae, sugarcane bagasse, 
zeolite, etc. to prepare various low-cost adsorbent 
materials capable of adsorbing pollutants such as dyes or 
heavy metals [21-27]. Inspired by this, the present study 
attempts to make ceramsite an efficient environmental 
functional material through modification techniques.  
In order to test the application effectiveness of modified 
ceramsite with high surface area as an environmental 
functional material, the modified ceramsite were 
used in the treatment process of lead-containing 
wastewater in Inner Mongolia region. There are various 
treatment technologies for lead-containing wastewater, 
such as oxidation, ion exchange, precipitation, and 
electrochemical treatment. Considering the local 
conditions and treatment cost, we chose to use the 
modified ceramsite as a cation adsorbent to remove 
lead ions from water. In summary, this study provides 
a novel surface modification technology for ceramsite, 
which cound promote the deep application of ceramsite 
in wastewater treatment.Material and Methods
Material
The ceramsite used in this study were prepared from 
four typical solid wastes in the laboratory, including 
construction and demolition waste (C&D), fly ash 
(FA), red mud (RM), and rice husk ash (RHA). The 
first three components mentioned (C&D, FA and RM) 
are the main ceramic components, while RHA is used  
as a pore-forming agent. The chemical compositions 
of the four raw materials and sintered ceramsite (SC) 
were determined using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry,  
and the results are shown in Table 1.
Ceramsite Preparation 
The whole experimental procedure of this study is 
illustrated in Fig. 1. The composition and function of 
each part of the ceramsite are as follows: construction 
and demolition waste is the main material, fly ash is the 
silicon-aluminum adjuster, red mud is the flux, and rice 
husk ash is the pore-forming agent. The ratio of the raw 
materials is as follows: construction waste: fly ash: red 
mud: rice husk ash = 10:2:3:1.5. The sintering conditions 
are as follows: sintering temperature of 1150ºC and 
a holding time of 10 minutes. The properties of the 
ceramsite are as follows: bulk density of 0.663 cm3/g, 
apparent density of 1.189 cm3/g, porosity of 44.268%, 
and water absorption of 3.32%.
Acid Treatment of Ceramsite
First, the ceramsite are crushed into uniform 
particles with a size of 8-10 mm and then placed in  
a certain volume of sulfuric acid solution and stirred on 
a magnetic stirrer at a rate of 300 rpm. After the Acid 
treatment process is completed, solid-liquid separation is 
carried out by filtering, and the solid product is washed 
three times with deionized water using ultrasonic waves, 
then dried at 105ºC to obtain the acid-treated ceramsite.
Alkali Modification of Ceramsite
The acid-treated ceramsite were placed in a NaOH 
solution under the following reaction conditions: 
liquid-to-solid ratio of 10:1, magnetic stirring speed

of 300 r/min, and reaction temperature of 60ºC. After 
6 hours of alkaline treatment solid-liquid separation 
was performed, and the solid product was washed three 
times with deionized water by ultrasonic treatment, 
and then dried at 105ºC to obtain the Alkali modified 
ceramsite.
Adsorption Test
0.5 g of the adsorbent was added into a series of 
conical flasks containing 50 mL of lead nitrate solution 
with concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 
and 700 mg/L. The system was stirred at 300 rpm, and 
the pH was controlled to be less than 6 to prevent the 
precipitation of lead nitrate. After a 6-hour adsorption 
period, the concentration of Pb2+ in the conical flask was 
determined.
Adsorbent Regeneration
Spent adsorbent were obtained after adsorbing lead 
ions from a lead nitrate solution with a concentration 
of 500 mg/L. The spent ceramsite were then subjected 
to a desorption process in a 1 mol/L hydrochloric 
acid solution for 30 minutes. Then, to reload hydroxyl 
groups, they were immersed in a 4 mol/L sodium 
hydroxide solution and reacted at 60ºC for 30 minutes. 
The regenerated modified ceramsite were subsequently 
obtained after drying.
Analysis and Characterization
Observation of surface morphology was carried 
out using a scanning electron microscope (TESCAN 
MIRA4). Ion concentration in the solution was 
determined using inductively coupled plasma optical 
emission spectrometry (Agilent 5110). X-ray diffraction analysis was performed using PANalytical Axios with 
the following parameters: Cu target, scanning angle 
range of 10° to 80°, scanning step of 0.02, scanning 
speed of 5°/min, working voltage of 40 kV, and current 
of 40 mA.
Results and Discussion 
Effect of Acid Treatment Conditions 
on Ceramsite
The effect of Acid treatment conditions on the Acid 
treatment of ceramsite was studied with the specific 
surface area as the main evaluation index. Multiple 
experimental results showed that the factors that 
significantly affect the specific surface area of acid-
modified ceramsite include acid concentration (Fig. 2a), 
reaction temperature (Fig. 2b), and reaction time 
(Fig. 2c). Among these factors, reaction time and acid 
concentration have a noticeable threshold effect on the 
specific surface area, such that exceeding a certain value 
leads to a significant decrease in the modification effect. 
For instance, when the acid concentration is higher 
than 5 mol/L and the reaction time exceeds 4 hours, the 
specific surface area no longer increases significantly, 
as shown in Fig. 2a) and Fig. 2b). However, reaction 
temperature shows a significant positive correlation 
with the specific surface area, as demonstrated in  
Fig. 2c), without a clear threshold. It should be noted 
that when the reaction temperature exceeds 80ºC, the 
loss of reaction liquid due to the high temperature of the 
water bath intensifies. Therefore, after comprehensive 
consideration, the optimized Acid treatment conditions 
chosen in this study are a reaction temperature of 80ºC, 
an acid concentration of 5 mol/L, and a reaction time of 
4 hours.

Mild Acid-Alkali Modification...1459
aluminum, iron, sodium, and magnesium in the modified 
ceramsite was significantly reduced, which confirms  
the etching reaction of the ceramsite under Acid 
treatment and leads to the release of some metal ions 
into the solution. As shown in Fig. 4, the main phases  
of the acid-treated ceramsite are quartz, pyroxene, 
calcite, and diopside. There is no significant change in 
the phases after Acid treatment. Based on the above 
analysis, it can be concluded that (1) minerals such as 
diopside, calcite, and pyroxene react with acid during the 
Acid treatment, causing metal elements such as calcium, 
aluminum, and iron to detach from ceramsite surface in 
the form of ions and enter the solution, resulting in a 
general reduction in their relative content; (2) quartz has 
a high content and extremely stable chemical properties, 
which ensures that the composite pore structure of the 
ceramsite after Acid treatment has a basic framework.
Reaction Mechanism of Ceramsite 
Acid Treatment
Further analysis of the crystal structure reveals 
that the calcium feldspar is a framework silicate, with  
a crystal structure belonging to the triclinic system, 
while the pyroxene mineral belongs to the chain-
structured silicates and the monoclinic system of the 
clinopyroxene subgroup. The easily soluble alkali 
or alkaline earth metals in the crystal cells of these Characterization of Acid-Treated Ceramsite
The microstructures of the ceramsite before and 
after Acid treatment were observed as shown in Fig. 3. 
The original ceramsite formed a pore structure during 
the sintering process due to the inclusion of some gas 
in the molten state, with pore sizes ranging from 100 
to 800 μm. Since the sintering temperature reached 
1150ºC during preparation, the ceramsite were sintered 
and a dense and smooth enamel structure was formed 
on ceramsite surface. Because the inner wall of the 
pores was smooth and flat, the specific surface area of 
the ceramsite before modification was very small, only  
0.31 m2/g. In Fig. 3b), the surface of the acid-treated 
modified ceramsite showed significant changes, 
becoming rougher and forming microstructures at  
a smaller scale. By further increasing the magnification, 
smaller pore structures with sizes of about 1-5 μm were 
observed on the surface of the ceramsite in Fig. 2d). 
Overall, the formation of new small pore structures 
was mainly due to the obvious etching effect on the 
ceramsite surface during Acid treatment, resulting in 
the significant increase in specific surface area of the 
ceramsite.
The ceramsite before and after Acid treatment were 
analyzed by XRF and XRD, and the results are shown 
in Table 2 and Fig. 4, respectively. According to Table 2, 
the relative content of metal elements such as calcium,

substances can react with acids. The chemical reactions 
of calcium feldspar and pyroxene with acid are shown in 
Equations (1) and (2), respectively [28-31].

Overall, in the Acid treatment process, silicate 
minerals in the ceramsite undergo dissolution reactions, 
leading to the release of some cations such as calcium, 
aluminum, and iron into the solution, while the stable 
silicon oxide framework is preserved. Under the effect 
of dissolution, a micro-porous structure is formed 
on the surface of the ceramsite. The macro-porous 
structure formed during the sintering process and the 
micro-porous structure formed by dissolution together 
constitute the composite pore structure, resulting  
in a significant increase in the specific surface area of 
the ceramsite after Acid treatment.
Effect of Alkali Modification for Ceramsite
After Acid treatment, the ceramsite formed  
a composite pore structure and had the potential as 
an adsorbent material. However, experimental tests 
showed that acid-treated ceramsite had poor adsorption 
efficiency for typical heavy metal Pb2+ ions (adsorption 
capacity was only 7.9 mg/g). Therefore, this study used 
an alkaline treatment method to introduce hydroxyl 
functional groups onto the surface of the ceramsite,  
in order to enhance their adsorption capacity for Pb2+. 
The infrared spectroscopy characterization results  
of the ceramsite before and after alkaline treatment 
are shown in Fig. 5, which indicates that the modified 
ceramic samples obtained after alkaline treatment exhibited obvious hydroxyl functional group peaks at 
3456 cm-1, indicating that hydroxyl groups have been 
loaded onto the surface of the ceramsite.
Adsorption Capacity of Modified Ceramsite 
for Pb2+
To investigate the kinetics of the adsorption process, 
the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and 
Elovich kinetic models were used to fit the experimental 
adsorption data [32-42]. The three kinetic models 
equation used in this study is as follows respectively:
Pseudo-first-order: 
               (3)
Pseudo-second-order:
                           (4)
Elovich:
                          (5)
where k1 represents the rate constant of the pseudo-first-
order kinetic model, t is the sampling time in minutes, k2 
is the rate constant of the pseudo-second-order kinetic 
model, qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity in 
mg/g, and qt is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent 
for arsenate at time t in mg/g.
The fitting results of adsorption kinetics are 
presented in Fig. 6 and Table 3. Among the three 
adsorption kinetic models, the pseudo-second-order 
model exhibited the best fitting performance, with  
a correlation coefficient of 0.998.
The removal capacity of modified ceramsite 
for Pb2+ was evaluated using isothermal adsorption 
experiments, and the adsorption isotherm was fitted 
using the Langmuir model and Freundlich model.  
The two isotherm equation used in this study is as 
follows respectively:
                    (6)
where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg/g); 
Ce is the equilibrium concentration of Pb2+ ( mg/L ); qmax

the Langmuir adsorption constant.

is a constant related to the adsorption capacity; KF is  
the Freundlich equilibrium constant.
The fitting results of isothermal adsorption are 
shown in Fig. 7 and Table 4. The error functions SSE, 
MSE, and RMSE of the Langmuir model are all smaller 
than those of the Freundlich model. Additionally, the 
correlation coefficient of the Langmuir model is 0.994, 
which is closer to 1. These data strongly indicate that the 
Langmuir model can more accurately fit the adsorption 
data of modified ceramsite for lead ions. Using 
Langmuir model, the calculated maximum adsorption 
capacity qmax was 33.2 mg/g, and the separation factor 
KL was 0.33, indicating that the adsorption process can 
occur spontaneously [43-53].                     
As shown in Table 5, the adsorption performance of 
the acid-alkali modified ceramsite prepared in this study 
has reached the same order of magnitude as common 
zeolite adsorbents. Considering that the ceramsite are 
made from solid waste and the modification process is easier to achieve than the preparation process of general 
zeolites, modified ceramsite has significant advantages 
in terms of preparation cost and process operability.
Adsorption Mechanism
The better adsorption performance of the modified 
ceramsite after acid-alkali co-modification mainly stems 
from two aspects: (1) During the acid treatment process, 
a composite pore structure is formed on the surface 
of the ceramsite due to acid corrosion, significantly 
enhancing the specific surface area, which serves as the 
fundamental condition for the adsorption capacity of the 
ceramsite. (2) After the alkaline treatment modification, 
numerous hydroxyl groups are loaded on the surface 
of the ceramsite. Hydroxyl groups play an important 
role in the adsorption of heavy metals. For example, 
the oxygen atoms on the hydroxyl groups can form 
coordination bonds with metal cations, thereby binding

the cations to the surface of the ceramsite. Additionally, 
the modified ceramsite have an isoelectric point pH 
value is 5.6, which means that under neutral conditions, 
the negatively charged surface of the modified ceramsite 
can adsorb cations through electrostatic interaction  
[57-62].Regeneration Capacity
The adsorption capacity of the regenerated adsorbent 
is shown in Fig. 8. Even after undergoing 4 regeneration 
cycles, the adsorption capacity of the regenerated 
ceramsite remained at a high level, with over 90% 
of the original adsorption capacity still maintained. 
The regeneration mechanism of the adsorbent is as 
follows: the alkaline treatment during the regeneration 
process reloads hydroxyl groups onto the surface of the 
ceramsite. Hydroxyl groups play a very important role 
for the adsorption of lead ions by the modified ceramsite, 
as described in section 3.6. Therefore, the regenerated 
ceramsite still possess a high adsorption capacity for 
lead ions.
Conclusions
The present study proposed a low-cost and 
convenient modification method for ceramsite using 
acid-alkali treatment, and the modified ceramsite could 
be used as a adsorbent for Pb2+. The main conclusions 
are as follows:
(1) Acid treatment can significantly increase the 
specific surface area of ceramsite through etching Adsorbent Qmax (mg/g) Raw material Production costs References

reaction. During the Acid treatment process, some 
phases in the ceramsite reacted with the acid, resulting 
in a composite pore structure on the surface of the 
ceramsite under etching, leading to a significant increase 
in the specific surface area.
(2) Alkali modification can load hydroxyl groups 
onto the surface of the ceramsite, significantly improving 
the heavy metal adsorption capacity. Hydroxyl groups 
can adsorb lead ions through coordination bonds and 
electrostatic interactions. The Pseudo-second-order 
kinetic mode and Langmuir isotherm model can better 
fit the adsorption data, and the calculated saturated 
adsorption capacity can reach 33.2 mg/g.
(3) Although the adsorption performance of modified 
ceramic particles is slightly lower than that of natural 
zeolite, it is important to consider that they are prepared 
using solid waste materials under mild conditions. 
Therefore, modified ceramic particles have significant 
advantages in terms of raw material sources and 
production costs.
