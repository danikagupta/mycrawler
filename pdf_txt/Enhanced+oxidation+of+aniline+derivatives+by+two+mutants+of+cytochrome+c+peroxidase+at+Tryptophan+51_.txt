ABSTRACT: Nature employs high-energy metal-oxo intermediates embedded
within enzyme active sites to perform challenging oxidative transformations withremarkable selectivity. Understanding how di ﬀerent local metal-oxo coordination
environments control intermediate reactivity and catalytic function is a long-standing objective. However, conducting structure −activity relationships directly in
active sites has proven challenging due to the limited range of amino acidsubstitutions achievable within the constraints of the genetic code. Here, we use anexpanded genetic code to examine the impact of hydrogen bonding interactions onferryl heme structure and reactivity, by replacing the N −H group of the active site
Trp51 of cytochrome cperoxidase by an S atom. Removal of a single hydrogen bond
stabilizes the porphyrin π-cation radical state of C cP W191F compound I. In
contrast, this modi ﬁcation leads to more basic and reactive neutral ferryl heme states, as found in C cP W191F compound II and the
wild-type ferryl heme-Trp191 radical pair of compound I. This increased reactivity manifests in a >60-fold activity increase towardphenolic substrates but remarkably has negligible e ﬀects on oxidation of the biological redox partner cyt c. Our data highlight how
Trp51 tunes the lifetimes of key ferryl intermediates and works in synergy with the redox active Trp191 and a well-de ﬁned substrate
binding site to regulate catalytic function. More broadly, this work shows how noncanonical substitutions can advance ourunderstanding of active site features governing metal-oxo structure and reactivity.

Enzymes are the most pro ﬁcient catalysts known, and
consequently there is great interest in deciphering their
sophisticated catalytic mechanisms. Site directed mutagenesishas been a staple technique in biochemistry for several decadesas a means of elucidating the role(s) of key residues andmolecular interactions.
1However, only a limited number of
amino acid substitutions are possible as de ﬁned by nature ’s
genetic code. Under these constraints, substitutions designed toprobe the importance of speci ﬁc interactions (e.g., hydrogen
bonds, π−πinteractions) often lead to signi ﬁcant structural
perturbations, making it di ﬃcult to parse out speci ﬁc
contributions to catalytic ac tivity and complicating the
interpretation of enzyme structure −activity relationships. This
challenge is particularly acute when probing the role of thelargest canonical amino acid, tryptophan, which has no closestructural analogue within the genetic code. The availability ofan expanded alphabet of amino acids provides a more surgicalmeans of probing biological mechanisms by allowing sub-stitutions of individual atoms or functional groups within
proteins of interest.
2−6The power of this approach is
exempli ﬁed through recent studies, whereby noncanonical
cysteine and histidine analogues have been used to examinethe role of axial heme ligands in controlling the reactivities oficonic ferryl intermediates compound I and compound II.

These high-energy intermediates are the de ﬁning feature that
drive catalysis across the entire family of heme enzymes,
including P450s, peroxidases, nitric oxide synthases, and
terminal oxidases.14,15Consequently, there is great interest in
understanding how di ﬀerent metal-oxo coordination environ-
ments within enzyme active sites control intermediate reactivityand overall catalytic function. Here, we use a noncanonical Trpanalogue to examine directly the impact of hydrogen bonding
interactions to the ferryl oxygen of compound I and compound
II of cytochrome cperoxidase. Our data reveal how hydrogen
bonding interactions are employed to control the reactivity ofhigh-energy ferryl intermediates in enzyme active sites and thusadvance our understanding of metal-oxo reactivity across a wide
range of heme and nonheme iron enzymes.

CcP employs a heme cofactor to reduce hydrogen peroxide in
mitochondria using electrons from its biological redox partnerferrous cytochrome c(cytc).14The reaction mechanism is
comprised of three steps ( Figure 1 ): (1) reaction of the resting
ferric enzyme with hydrogen peroxide to generate compound I
(CpdI), containing an oxidized ferryl (Fe(IV) O) heme
coupled to a neighboring Trp191 radical cation;16(2) single
electron reduction of CpdI by ferrous cyt cto generate
compound II (CpdII); and (3) single electron reduction ofCpdII by a second equivalent of ferrous cyt c. CpdII reduction is
coupled with proton transfer to the ferryl oxygen, with the distalpocket His52 as the likely proton donor.
17,18In addition to
redox active Trp191, C cP contains a second active site Trp51
whose N −H group forms a hydrogen bond to the ferryl oxygen
of CpdI and CpdII ( Figure S1 ).19This interaction is also present
in ascorbate peroxidase (APX), but is absent in many hemeperoxidases, including the prototypical peroxidase from horse-radish, which contains a Phe residue in place of the Trp51 of C cP
(Figure S1 ).
20,21Interestingly, Trp51Phe and Trp51Ala
substitutions in C cP have been shown to substantially increase
the rate of nonbiological oxidations of small molecule phenolicsand anilines, along with more modest increases in cyt coxidation
activity.22−24The analogous Trp41Phe substitution in APX has
also been shown to increase activity with non-native phenolicsubstrates.25However, the molecular origins of this increased
reactivity of Trp51/41 variants of C cP and APX are not well
understood. Some have argued that steric e ﬀects dominate, and
that the introduction of smaller residues provides more spaceandﬂexibility in the distal heme pocket, which could give rise to
the observed activity changes.26Elsewhere, the increased
reactivity of Trp51 variants of C cP has been ascribed to an
increase in activation entropy, plausibly due to a more facilerelease of water from the heme iron.22Others have suggested
that hydrogen bonding between Trp51 and the ferryl oxygen hasa stabilizing e ﬀect on key intermediates.23
To resolve these uncertaint ies, we replaced Trp51 of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae CcP with 3-benzothienyl- L-alanine (S-
Trp), a close structural analogue of tryptophan that cannot serve
as a hydrogen bond donor, using an engineered pyrrolysyl-tRNA
synthetase/pyrrolysyl-tR NA pair (PylRS_S-Trp/tRNAPyl),
which selectively incorporates S-Trp in response to the amberUAG stop codon.27Stoichiometric replacement of the distal
Trp51 residue with S-Trp was con ﬁrmed by MS analysis of the
intact protein ( Table S3 ). The X-ray crystal structure of C cPS -
Trp (1.5 Å resolution, Table S2 ,Figure S2a ) superimposes wellwith a previously reported C cP structure ( Figure 2 , PDB code:
2CYP, RMS deviation of 0.27 Å).28Diﬀerence density
(additional electron density) associated with the S atom of S-
Trp51 was clearly visible. The geometry and environment of theheme cofactor and key active site residues are well preserved inthe modi ﬁed enzyme, with only minor conformational adjust-
ments to the distal pocket His52, thus con ﬁrming Trp51S-Trp
to be a highly conservative substitution. As anticipated, the X-raycrystal structure of the C cP S-Trp W191F double mutant is
highly similar to that of C cP S-Trp (1.7 Å resolution, Table S2 ,
Figure S2b ), with a secondary structure superposed RMS
deviation of 0.17 Å ( Figure S2c ).
Rapid mixing stopped- ﬂow measurements were used to
examine the nature of ferryl intermediates generated uponoxidation of C cP and C cP S-Trp with hydrogen peroxide.
Consistent with previous studies, mixing C cP with 1.5 equiv of
H
2O2leads to spectral changes consistent with the formation of
a neutral ferryl heme (Soret maxima at 420 nm and associated Qbands at 530 and 560 nm, Figure 3 a).29Similar spectral changes
are observed upon oxidation of C cP S-Trp ( Figure 3 b), albeit
with a slight decrease in the extinction coe ﬃcient of the Soret
band (maxima at 420 nm) and Q-band features that are less well

resolved than in the wild-type, suggesting that the CpdI state of
CcP S-Trp is also comprised of a neutral ferryl heme. Time-
dependent spectral changes were ﬁtted to a sequential a →b
model to derive rates for CpdI formation and are similar for bothCcP and C cP S-Trp ( k=9 6±3 and 100 ±2s
−1, respectively).
To determine the identity of the protein radical in C cP S-Trp,
CpdI was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance(EPR). The C cP S-Trp CpdI EPR line shape is very similar to
that of C cP CpdI ( Figure 3 c), con ﬁrming the formation of a
coupled ferryl heme-Trp191 radical pair. The small change inthe down ﬁeld “shoulder ”gvalue from C cPt oC cP S-Trp (2.041
to 2.033) likely arises due to the well-documented sensitivity of
the magnetic coupling between the Trp191 cation radical and
the ferryl heme to small local structural perturbations.30To
further characterize the ferryl intermediate upon disruption ofthe hydrogen bond to Trp51, resonance Raman spectra of C cP
and C cP S-Trp were recorded in both the ferric and ferryl states
(Figure 3 d). Hydrogen bonding interactions to ferryl
intermediates are thought to give rise to an increased Fe −O
bond length and an associated reduction in Fe −O stretching
frequencies.
31The intensity of the Raman feature associated
with ferric C cP at 757 cm−1diminishes upon oxidation with
H2O2, giving rise to a broad ferryl peak at 753 cm−1,i n
accordance with the literature.32Oxidation of C cP S-Trp also
diminishes the 757 cm−1feature of the ferric state but instead
leads to a new feature at 791 cm−1(Figure 3 d), which we assign
as the Fe −O stretch. The feature at 791 cm−1is also observed in
the C cP S-Trp W191F double mutant ( Figure S3 ). Density
Functional Theory (DFT) models ( vide infra) of the C cP ferryl
state predict that the Trp51S-Trp substitution leads to a ∼0.02 Å
shortening of the ferryl bond, with an associated 44 cm−1
increase in calculated Fe −O stretching frequency, which
correlates well with the 38 cm−1increase observed exper-
imentally ( Figure S4 ).
To investigate the e ﬀect of the Trp51S-Trp substitution on
ferryl heme stability, stopped ﬂow measurements were repeated
over a longer time frame. In wild-type C cP, the neutral ferryl
heme was stable for >5 min ( Figure S5c ). In contrast, time-
resolved UV/vis spectra reveal that the ferryl heme of C cP S-Trp
decays to the ferric state with rate of k3=∼0.04 s−1(Figure S5a ).
To gain insights into the origins of this reduced ferryl hemelifetime, we replaced the redox active Trp191 with Phe in C cP
and C cP S-Trp, which allows the CpdI and CpdII states to be
diﬀerentiated spectroscopically ( Figure 4 a). Previous studies
have demonstrated that oxidation of C cP W191F generates a
classical CpdI porphyrin π-cation radical state typical of most
peroxidases with spectral features distinct to neutral ferryl heme
systems.

Trp with H 2O2(1.5 equiv) leads to the rapid (transient)
formation of a CpdI porphyrin π-cation radical at similar rates in
both variants ( k1= 126 ±1 and 122 ±1s−1, respectively, Figure
4b,c,Figures S6 and S7 ), as indicated by a substantial decrease in
the Soret intensity (maxima at 406 and 407 nm, respectively).These data provide further evidence that Trp191 is the site of
radical formation in both WT and C cP S-Trp. The CpdI states of
CcP W191F and C cP S-Trp W191F subsequently decay to a
neutral ferryl heme (CpdII) with rates ( k
2) of 24.2 ±0.1 s−1and
6.93 ±0.01 s−1, respectively, indicating that the S-Trp
substitution stabilizes the CpdI porphyrin π-cation radical
(Figure 4 b,c, Figures S6 and S7 ). In contrast, the S-Trp
substitution decreases the lifetime of the CpdII state, which isstable for >5 min in C cP W191F ( k
3=≪0.003 s−1) but decays
with a rate of k3=∼0.07 s−1in CcP S-Trp W191F ( Figure 4 d,
Figure S5b,d ). This is similar to the observed increased reactivity
of the neutral ferryl heme state of C cP S-Trp vs wild-type C cP.
To understand the contrasting impact of the S-Trp
substitution on CpdI and CpdII reactivity in C cP W191F,
active site DFT calculations employing the Gaussian 09 softwarepackage were used to explore cluster models (see SIfor details),
which were generated based on a previously reported C cP CpdI
structure (PDB code: 5EJX).17The calculations showed that
replacement of Trp51 with S-Trp led to a modest 1.3 kcal mol−1
reduction in the calculated electron a ﬃnity of CpdI, in
accordance with the slower rate of CpdI reduction observedexperimentally with the C cP S-Trp W191F variant ( Figure 4 b).
Our in silico results show that reduction of CpdII leads to
spontaneous proton transfer from His52 (via an ordered water)to generate a ferric hydroxide state. Despite the increased
reactivity of CpdII observed experimentally in C cP S-Trp
variants, PCET to CpdII is thermodynamically less favorable inCcP S-Trp W191F ( ΔΔG
PCET= 3.6 kcalmol−1,Figure S9 ,Table
S4). We considered the possibility that the increased rate of
CpdII decay could be attributed to single electron oxidation orsulfoxidation of S-Trp51. However, these o ﬀ-pathway processes
were discounted as (1) in silico sulfoxidation of S-Trp by CpdI,
and to a greater extent CpdII, is endothermic ( Table S12 ) and
(2) prior studies have shown S-Trp to be considerably morediﬃcult to oxidize to the radical state than Trp.
34To investigate
the origins of the increased CpdII reactivity, we instead elected
to deconvolute the PCET process into the component electronand proton transfer steps. We ﬁrst calculated diabatic electron
aﬃnities for CpdII (EA
II), which show that S-Trp substitution
leads to a substantial reduction in electron a ﬃnity (ΔEAII= 10.0
kcal mol−1,Figure S9 ,Table S4 ). Similar ΔEAIIvalues were
calculated for adiabatic CpdII reduction by placing restrictionson the N −H/O−H bonds of Arg48, His52, and the ordered
water. In contrast, proton transfer to the reduced CpdII species
(ΔG
H‑transfer =ΔGPCET−EAII) is 6.4 kcalmol−1more favorable
in C cP S-Trp W191F. Numerous studies have demonstrated
how the kinetics of PCET and related H atom transfers to ferrylcenters are dominated by the basicity of the ferryl-oxygen,9,35−37
and therefore we propose that the increased reactivity of CpdII
observed experimentally upon S-Trp substitution can beascribed to the substantial increase in ΔG
H‑transfer .
The combined experimental and computational data indicate
that the Trp51 residue suppresses the reactivity and protonaﬃnity of CpdII through hydrogen bonding to the ferryl oxygen.
To understand the role of Trp51 in regulating the catalyticfunction of C cP, we determined the kinetic parameters for the
oxidation of ferrous cyt c, and the nonbiological reductant
guaiacol ( ortho -methoxyphenol), by Trp51 and S-Trp51variants of C cP and C cP W191F. The Trp51S-Trp substitution
in C cP and C cP W191F causes dramatic 64-fold and 32-fold
increases in the k
catof guaiacol oxidation, respectively, with only
modest changes in KM(Figure 5 ,Figure S8a,b ). This increased
activity correlates well with the increased CpdII reactivity
observed in the S-Trp containing variants. In contrast, the rate ofcytcoxidation is only modestly a ﬀected by the Trp51S-Trp
substitution ( k
cat= 819 ±46 s−1and 596 ±33 s−1for C cP and
CcP S-Trp, respectively, Figure 5 and Figure S8c ). As
anticipated, replacement of the redox active Trp191 with Pheabolishes cyt coxidation activity in C cP and C cP S-Trp.33
Taken together, these data demonstrate how Trp51 tunes the
lifetimes of key ferryl intermediates and works in synergy withthe redox active Trp191 to control the substrate speci ﬁcity of
CcP. Speci ﬁcally, hydrogen-bonding from Trp51 extends the
lifetimes of neutral ferryl heme intermediates, such as CpdII andthe CpdI ferryl heme-Trp191 radical pair, which is likelyimportant for biological function.
38This study builds upon
previous work to improve the reactivity of C cP toward small
molecules by engineering binding sites for non-nativesubstrates.29,39What emerges is a complex picture whereby
local ferryl coordination environments, the location and stabilityof key radical intermediates, and the presence of well-de ﬁned
substrate binding sites work in synergy to control enzymeactivity and selectivity. Nevertheless, the observation thatTrp41Phe variants of APX (e.g., APEX2) also show increasedactivity with nonbiological substrates suggests that hydrogen-bonding to ferryl intermediates may control substrate speci ﬁcity
across multiple peroxidases.
10,25Further detailed studies will be
needed to fully understand how high cyt coxidation activity is
achieved by the wild-type enzyme in spite of the reduced CpdIIreactivity as a result of hydrogen bonding between Trp51 andthe ferryl oxygen. Nevertheless, our data are consistent with amodel where binding of the biological redox partner ferrous cyt c
induces subtle long-range conformational changes that weakenthe Trp51-ferryl oxygen hydrogen bond to trigger e ﬃcient
proton-coupled electron transfer from cyt c via the redox active
Trp191. Alternatively, substrate speci ﬁcity for cyt cis achieved
through tightly coupled proton and electron delivery to CpdII,which is perfectly tuned through evolution to minimize thebarrier to PCET. These mechanistic hypotheses would explainwhy the Trp51S-Trp mutation has negligible impact on cyt c
oxidation activity, but causes a large increase in nonbiological

oxidations due to the formation of an inherently more reactive
CpdII state.
This study illustrates how an expanded genetic code can
provide new tools to study complex bioinorganic reactionmechanisms. Genetically encoded cysteine and histidineanalogues have been used by our lab and others to probe theinﬂuence of proximal heme ligands on CpdI and CpdII
reactivity.
9−12Here, we have employed a noncanonical Trp
analogue to elucidate how an active site hydrogen bondregulates C cP function by modulating ferryl heme p K
aand
reactivity. Proton-coupled electron transfers and related H atomtransfers to high-energy metal-oxo intermediates are thought tobe ubiquitous in biological systems.
17,35,40Consequently, we
anticipate that the results presented will have wide-rangingimplications for our understanding of metal-oxo reactivity in
diverse enzyme active sites.
