This chart is not intended to be used to make medical decisions and is for informational purposes only. It was constructed using data whenever possible, 
although extrapolation from known information was also used to inform risk. Any decision to start, stop , or taper medication and/or use psychedelic drugs 
should be made in conjunction with your healthcare provider(s). It is recommended to not perform any illicit activity. This chart  the in tellectual property of

SSRIs  
· Paroxetine (Paxil)  
· Sertraline (Zoloft)

·Levomilnacipran (Fetzima)  Taper & discontinue at least 2 
weeks prior (all except 
fluoxetine) or 6 weeks prior 
(fluoxetine only) due to loss of 
psychedelic effect  
 
MDMA is unable to cause 
release of serotonin when the 
serotonin reuptake pump is 
blocked. This leads to drastically 
reduced effects [1-7] Consider taper & 
discontinuation at least 2 weeks 
prior (all except  fluoxetine)  or 6 
weeks prior (fluoxetine only) 
due to potential loss of 
psychedelic effect  
 
Chronic antidepressant use may 
result in down -regulation of 
5HT2A receptors and blunted 
psychedelic experiences  [8, 9] . 
This does not seem  to affect 
psilocybin for some  Taper & discontinue at least 2 
weeks prior (all except 
fluoxetine) or 6 weeks prior 
(fluoxetine only) due to 
potential risk of serotonin 
syndrome  
 
Life threatening toxicities can 
occur with these 
combination s and is strictly 
contraindicated  [10, 11]  Has been studied and 
found effective both with 
and without concurrent  
use of antidepressants  
 
 
Recommended  
to be used in conjunction 
with oral antidepressants 
by esketamine 
manufacturer  Taper & discontinue at 
least 2 weeks prior  (all 
except fluoxetine) or 6 
weeks prior (fluoxetine 
only) due to risk of 
additive QTc interval 
prolongation, 
arrhythmias , or 
cardiotoxicity  
 
Some antidepressants are 
liver ( CYP2D6 ) inhibitors 
and have been shown to 
double ibogaine blood 
concentrations [12] 
DNRI  
· Bupropion (Wellbutrin)  
 Increased effects of MDMA with 
higher blood concentrations for 
longer  [13]. May increase risk of 
seizures in combination. Caution 
in combination. Consider taper 
& discontinuation of bupropion. 
Alternatively, a 25% reduced 
dose of MDMA if bupropion is 
continued.  Loss of effect not predicted to 
occur, consider taper & 
discontinuation depending on 
goals of psychedelic use  Taper & discontinue at least 2 
weeks prior due to potential 
of adverse effects, however 
serotonin syndrome unlikely 
to occur  [14] Taper & discontinue at 
least 2 weeks prior to use . 
May increase risk of 
seizures in combination.   
 
CYP2D6 inhibitor with 
potential to increase 
ibogaine blood 
cocnentrations  
· Mirtazapine (Remeron)  
 
 
 Taper & discontinue at least 2 weeks prior due to loss of psychedelic effect  
 
Mirtazapine does not block the serotonin reuptake pump like SSRI, SPARI, or SNRI antidepressants. It 
blocks the 5HT2A receptor, thus is predicted to cause a blunting or loss of psychedelic effects. It has 
not been associated wit h serotonin syndr ome with MAOIs  [14]

least 2 week prior due to 
risk of additive QTc 
interval prolongation, 
arrhythmias, or

 Antidepressant  Phenethylamines  
-MDMA, mescaline  Tryptamines  
-Psilocybin, LSD  MAOI -containing  
-Ayahuasca, Syrian Rue  Ketamine  Ibogaine  
Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA)  
· Amitriptyline (Elavil)  
· Nortriptyline (Pamelor)  
· Clomipramine (Anafranil)  
· Imipramine (Tofranil)  
· Desipramine (Norpramin)  
· Chlorpheniramine  
 Taper & discontinue at 
least 2 weeks prior  due to 
loss of psychedelic effect  
 
MDMA is unable to cause 
release of serotonin when 
the serotonin reuptake 
pump is b locked. This leads 
to drastically reduced 
effects  Consider taper & 
discontinuation at least 2 
weeks prior  due to potential 
intensified effects  
 
Chronic TCA use was reported 
to increase the subjective 
effects of LSD [15]  Taper & discontinue at least 2 
weeks prior due to potential risk of 
serotonin syndrome . Risk is 
highest with clomipramine, 
imipramine, and chlorpheniramine 
[14]  
 
Life threatening toxicities can 
occur with these combinations and 
is strictly contraindicated  Has been studied 
and found effective 
both with and 
without concurrent  
use of 
antidepressants  
 
 
Recommended  
to be used in 
conjunction with 
oral antidepressants 
by esketamine 
manufacturer  Taper & discontinue at 
least 2 weeks prior  due 
to risk of additive QTc 
interval prolongation, 
arrhythmias, or 
cardiotoxicity  
 
Some antidepr essants 
are liver ( CYP2D6 ) 
inhibitors and have 
been shown to double 
ibogaine blood 
concentrations  
· Trazodone (Desyrel)  
 
 Taper & discontinue at least 5 days prior due to loss of psychedelic effect  
 
Trazodone blocks 5HT2A receptors at lower doses (25 -150mg) and starts blocking the serotonin 
reuptake pump (SERT) at >150mg  [14]. It has an active metabolite  that also blocks 5HT2A receptors 
as well as modu lating many other 5HT receptors  Taper & discontinue at 
least 1 week prior due 
to risk of additive QTc 
interval prolongation, 
arrhythmias, or 
cardiotoxicity  
· Buspirone (Buspar)  Taper & discontinue at least 5 days prior due to loss of psychedelic effect  
 
Buspirone is a non -psychedelic partial agonist at serotonin receptors, thus may di splay blunting of 
psychedelic effects due to competitive inhibition when used in combination with psychedelics [16]. 
It does not inhibit the reuptake of nor release neurotransmitters, thus risk of serotonin syndrome 
with MAOIs is low  Taper & discontinue at 
least 5 days  prior  due 
to potential risk of 
toxicity  
 
MAO -A Inhibitors*  
· Phenelzine ( Nardil)  
· Isocarboxazid ( Marplan ) 
· Tranylcypromine ( Parnate ) 
· Moclobemide  
 
*chronic use  Taper & discontinue at 
least 2 weeks prior  due to 
potential risk of serotonin 
syndrome  or hypertensive 
crisis [17] 
 Consider taper & 
discontinuation at least 2 
weeks prior  due to potential 
loss of psychedelic effect  [15] 
 
Contraindicated with 
tryptamine 5 -MeO -DMT [18, 
19] Taper & discontinue at least 2 
weeks prior   
 
Additive use of MAOIs may cause 
intensified experiences or 
cardiovascular collapse (fainting or 
dangerously low blood pressure)  Taper & disc ontinue at 
least 10 days  prior  due 
to potential risk of 
toxicity [20] 
 
 
MAO -B inhibitors  
· Selegeline (Emsam)  
 Intensified effects, risk of 
serotonin syndrome at 
doses ≥9mg/day  
 
Taper & discontinue at 
least 2 weeks prior , 
especially if dose ≥9mg/day  Intensified effects possible, risk 
of serotonin syndrome at 
doses ≥9mg/day with 5 -MeO -
DMT; psilocybin or LSD likely 
have low risks of physical 
toxicity in combination
