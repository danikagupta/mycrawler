Recent Technology of siRNA Delivery System 
Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) has been used extensively 
in blocking various genes and is presently being evaluated as a 
therapeutic for cancer and viral disease. RNA interference was 
first identified as a defence mechanism against the invasion of 
foreign genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and had 
subsequently been discovered in diverse eukaryotes such as fungi, 
insects, plants, and vertebrates. Researchers demonstrated that 
synthetic siRNAs were able to induce RNAi in mammalian cells. 
RNAi could affect gene silencing through chromatin remodeling, 
blocking protein synthesis and cleaving specifically targeted 
mRNA. 
RNAi gene-silencing is dependent on the structure of the 
initiating RNA such as complete (siRNA) or incomplete (miRNA). 
These double stranded RNAs were processed by RNase III 
endonuclease enzyme called Dicer, which produces duplexes 
of approximately 21 nucleotides. After the action of Dicer, 
guide strand (one of the two strands of each fragment), were 
incorporated into the RNA induced silencing complex. Chemical 
modification of the phosphonothioate linkage had been used as 
a simple and effective method to increase the nuclease resistance 
of siRNA [1]. Other methods employed for the enhancement of 
siRNA stability in biological fluids including modification of the 
2′-hydroxyl group of the pantone sugar, such as 2′-O-methyl or a 
methylene linkage between the 2′ and 4′ positions of the ribose 
[2].It is becoming clear that due to its instability and degradability, 
naked siRNA is rarely applied in systemic delivery accordingly; 
this section will deal primarily with siRNA-loaded carriers, such as 
nanospheres, nanocapsules, liposomes, micelles, microemulsions, 
conjugates, and other nanoparticles. Polymeric biomaterials are 
classically biodegradable and positively charged (e.g., cationic 
cell penetrating peptides, cationic polymers, dendrimers, cationic 
lipids etc.) that are widely used as drug (gene, growth factor) 
carrier [3-20].
Conjugation of siRNA with a variety of small molecules 
(e.g., cholesterol, bile acids, and lipids), polymers, peptides, 
proteins (e.g., antibodies), as well as aptamers (e.g., RNAs), and 
encapsulating siRNA in nanoparticulate formulations improves 
the stability, cellular internalization, or cell-speciﬁc active 
targeted delivery synthetic polymers which have been widely 
investigated for siRNA delivery. These synthetic polymers may 
enhance intracellular delivery by facilitating endosomal escape 
and inducing lysosomal disruption, endosomal release, and siRNA 
protection from lysosomal degradation by way of buffering the 
endosomes [21-30]. Biodegradable polymers have been reported 
that they are enabling to undergo hydrolytic degradation, yielding 
non-toxic and neutral pH degradation products, thereby providing 
sustained gene delivery [31-45].
    Therapies based on siRNA are entering clinics, especially for 
diseases requiring locoregional treatments, including age-related Abstract
Drug delivery systems (DDS) have shown great promise in delivery of drugs and genetic materials or pharmaceuticals and other xenobiotics 
to their site of action within an organism and eliminate the side effect and enhance the therapeutic effects of the drugs at exact delivery position. 
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a class of nucleic acid-based drugs able to suppress gene expression by interaction with mRNA before its 
translation. The primary success of siRNA delivery greatly depends on suitable vectors to deliver therapeutic genes. The main problems in the 
delivery of siRNA-based drugs for therapeutic use are the low efficiency of siRNA delivery to target cells and tissues. This review articles discusses 
the recent technology of siRNA delivery systems using new biomaterials and nanoparticles.

Conclusion
Although progress has been made in the field of siRNA delivery 
systems, there are several obstacles and concerns to be overcome 
before this new drug could be used as a new therapeutic agent. 
Several strategies need to minimize off-target effects, avoiding 
immune responses, increasing resistance to nuclease degradation 
and effective in delivery of siRNA to the appropriate cells or tissues 
by manipulating biopharmaceutical properties.
