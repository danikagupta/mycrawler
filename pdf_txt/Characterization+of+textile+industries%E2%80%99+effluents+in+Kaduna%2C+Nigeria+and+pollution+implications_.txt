ABSTRACT 
Effluents from five major textile industries in Ka duna (Nigeria) were characterized for a proposed 
central effluent treatment plant. Seven of the me asured parameters exceeded the limit set by the 
Federal Ministry of Environment. Colour intensity exceeded it in all the samples (Mills 1 – 5) by about 
350 folds on the average while COD, TSS, NH 3, BOD 5, and S2- were by 24, 13, 8, 7 and 3 folds 
respectively. TDS was detected in all samples with  limit exceeded only in Mill 2. Nitrate, oil and 
grease were detected in Mills 1 and 2 and within th e limit. Al, Mn, and Zn were detected in 80% and 
within the limit while Fe was detect ed in 60 %. Cu was detected in 80 % with limit exceeded about 3 
folds on the average. The present study is focused on the pollution implications of these effluents from 
textile operations in the city; important because of the risk of human exposure to them.

 INTRODUCTION 
Industrial pollution is one of the problems 
presently facing Nigeria and several efforts are 
being vigorously pursued to control it in various industries spanning length and breadth of the country to see that Nigerians live in a disease-free environment. Effluent generated by the 
industries is one of the sources of pollution. 
Contaminated air, soil, and water by effluents from the industries are associated with heavy disease burden (WHO, 2002) and this could be part of the reasons for the current shorter life expectancy in the country (WHO, 2003) when 
compared to the developed nations. Some heavy metals contained in these effluents (either in free 
form in the effluents or adsorbed in the 
suspended solids) from the industries have been 
found to be carcinogenic (Tamburlini et al ., 
2002) while other chemicals equally present are poisonous depending on the dose and exposure duration (Kupchella and Hyland, 1989). These 
chemicals are not only poisonous to humans but 
also found toxic to aquatic life (WHO, 2002) and they may result in food contamination (Novick, 1999). Ammonia is harmful to fish or other aquatic 
organisms at free (un-ionized) concentration of 
10 – 50 µg/l or higher pH and the sulphide in the CHARACTERIZATION OF TEXTILE INDUSTRIES’ EFFLUENTS 213 
effluent are of environmental concern (WHO, 
2000) because they can lead to poor air quality of 
an area if not properly taken care of thus becoming threat to human, vegetation, and materials. The same is applicable to pH that has been identified to raise health issue if water available for human use is not of the required 
level (WHO, 1993). Textile industries are major 
sources of these effluents (Ghoreishi and Haghighi, 2003) due to the nature of their operations which requires high volume of water that eventually results in high wastewater 
generation. They are one of the largest of water 
users and polluters (Nemerow, 1978) 
Kaduna (Lat. 10.52 °N, Long 7.44 °E) located in 
Kaduna State occupies central portion of 
Northern Nigeria (Kaduna, 2004). Founded in 
1917 as an administrative headquarters of Northern Nigeria, it is presently one of the most important cities in the country. As at 1991 (the last official census date in Nigeria) it had a population of 993,600 but currently projected to 
be home to about 1,563,300 (TWG, 2004) 
people. Apart from presently being the administrative headquarters of its state it has a high concentration of Federal Parastatals, Schools, and other public institutions. Industrially, it is one of  the most developed cities 
in Northern Nigeria and textile industries are 
some of its dominating industries. It is on record that the first textile industry in Nigeria was established in this city (Jibrin, 2004) and this could be one of the reasons for its high population density (Olanrewaju, 2001), a reason 
for the importance of this study. 
River Kaduna, a major river in the city receives the effluents from these industries. It does not only run across the entire city but also, it is a major tributary of the Niger River (Gefu and 
Kolawole, 2002), an indication of the extent to 
which pollutants in the e ffluent can reach (Figure 
1). As a Northern Nigerian city, Kaduna is characterized with high evaporation during the long dry season. This could result in volatilization of chemicals in the effluents and 
release of heavy metals as particulates due to 
their adsorption on the effluents’ solids. Thus, air quality around the banks of this River and the entire city could be negatively affected. This calls for a proper treatment of effluents from the 
industries to be sure that environmental 
indicators do not exceed the set limit at any point in time.

The textile industry is distinguished by raw 
material used and this determines the volume of 
water required for production as well as wastewater generated. Production may be from raw cotton, raw wool, and synthetic materials but in Kaduna city, the five major industries studied are raw cotton-based. In this type of production, 
slashing, bleaching, mercerizing, and dyeing are 
the major consumption activities as well as wastewater generation (Figure 2). The nature of the processing exerts a strong influence on the potential impacts associated with textile 
manufacturing operations due to the different characteristics associated with these effluents 
(Table 1). Specific water use varies from 60-400 
l/kg of fabric, depending on the type of fabric (PRG, 1998; AEPA, 1998).  Every process and operation within a textile dyeing and finishing plant has an environmental aspect that should be considered and for which environmental 
performance can potentially be improved. This is 
in addition to the input of a wide rage of chemicals, which, if not contained in the final product, become waste tr eatment and disposal 
problems.

Key environmental issues associated with textile 
manufacture are water use, treatment and disposal of aqueous effluent. The risk factors are primarily associated with the wet processes -scouring, desizing, mercerizing, bleaching, 
dyeing and finishing. Desizing, scouring and 
bleaching processes produce large quantities of wastewater. Treatment for colour removal can increase the risk pollution.  For instance, treating 
azo-dyes results in production of amines which 
could be a greater environmental risk than the 
dye itself. Villegas  – Navarro et al.  (2001) reported that 
textile effluents are foxier in terms of LC
50 and 
exhibit very high toxicity with acute toxicity unit (ATU) levels between 22 and 960. Dyes 
contributed to overall toxicity at all process 
stages. Also, dye baths could have high level of BOD/COD, colour, toxicity, surfactants, fibres and turbidity, and may contain heavy metals (AEPA, 1998). They genera lly constitute a small 
fraction of total liquid effluent, but may 
contribute a high proportion of total contaminants. Wynne et al.  (2001) noted that 
textile effluents are highly coloured and saline, contain non-biodegradable compounds, and are high in Biochemical and Chemical Oxygen 
Demand (BOD, COD). They reported that the 
presence of metals and other dye compounds inhibit microbial activity and some cases may cause failure of biological treatment system.  EPA (1974) reported that the pollutional 
parameters in textile wastewater effluents are 
suspended solids, BOD, COD, nitrogen, phosphate, temperature, toxic chemicals (phenol), chromium and heavy metals, pH, alkalinity-acidity, oils an d grease, sulphides, and 
coliform bacteria. FEPA (1991) also supported these and demands for their proper monitoring in the textile effluents in the country. Textile effluents are high in BOD due to fibre residues 
and suspended solids (AEPA, 1998). They can 
contaminate water with oils, grease, and waxes (Akintunde, 1986) while some may contain heavy metals such as chromium, copper, zinc and mercury (EPA 1974). Dyeing process 
usually contributes chromium, lead, zinc and 
copper to wastewater (Ben avides, 1992). Copper 
is toxic to aquatic plants at concentrations below 1.0 mg/l while concentration near this level can be toxic to some fish (Sawyer and McCarty, 1978). 
 
METHODOLOGY 
All field meters and equipment (Table 2) were 
checked and calibrated according to the manufacturers specifications.  The pH meter was calibrated using HACH (1997) buffers of pH 4.0, 
7.0 and 10.0; TDS/conductivity/salinity meter 
was calibrated using the potassium chloride solution provided by the manufacturer (HACH, 1997); the spectrophotometers (HACH DR890 and DR2010) were checked for malfunctioning 
by passing standard solutions of all the 
parameters to be measured; Blank samples (de-ionized water) were passed between every three measurements of effluent samples so as to check for any eventual contamination or abnormal response of equipment. Reproducibility of results 
was regularly checked by carrying out periodic 
analysis of aliquots collected from one sample.

 The fieldwork involved taking samples at points 
at which effluents discharge into drains for 
laboratory analyses. Two litres of each sample was taken in plastic containers and one litre per sample was taken in bottles for oil and grease determination. The samples were taken during 
the period of heaviest activity corresponding to 
the highest volume discharge and hence the worst situation. There was a need for sample preservation and for all the parameters, HACH (1997) recommended methods were used. In-situ measurements for some of the parameters 
– pH and temperature - were carried out using 
portable HACH conductivity meter. Determination of othe r parameters (total 
dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids 
(TSS), colour, nitrate, ammonia, and sulphide) 
was carried out in the laboratory using the 
spectrophotometers. Heavy metal (aluminum, chromium, iron, zinc, manganese, and copper) determination was carried out using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). For oil and grease concentr ation determination, 
gravimetrical method (APHA, 1998) was used 
after solvent extraction with xylene. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined by the dichromate digestion method while biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) was determined by the 
dilution method. 
 
RESULTS 
Generally the effluents characteristics need to be 
properly monitored for better environmental protection. Though all the textile mills had their 
effluent temperatures between 26 and 35.7 
OC 
(Table 3) which are below the set limit by the Federal Environment Protection Agency (FEPA, 1991), the pH range (10 – 11.5) calls for more attention. These effluents were basic in nature. 
The colours of all the effluents were several 
times higher than the allowable limit of 7 Pt-Co. They ranged from 612 – 4637 Pt-Co with effluents from mills 1, 3 and 4 having values above 2250 Pt-Co. With the exception of wastewater from mill 2 that has a TDS 
concentration of 2200 mg/l the other effluents 
had TDS levels within the acceptable limit of 2000 mg/l. Though the total suspended solids levels in the effluent from mill 2 and mill 5 could be acceptable, the effluents from the other mills 
had TSS levels of more than eight folds of the 
acceptable limit. Both measured BOD and COD levels also exceed the set limit by about three and thirteen folds respectively. Apart from mills 2, 4 and 5, the sulphide levels in the effluents were high (0.58 – 0.64 mg/l) as against the 
standard limit of 0.2 mg/l.   Ammonia levels 
were high in all the effluents (1.82 – 2.72 mg/l) except in mill 4 that had a lower value of 0.05 mg/l. Nutrients and micro-nutrients (nitrate, iron, calcium and manganese) were all below the 
national standard. Oil and grease was detected in 
the effluents from mills 1 and 2 and both were below the 6.0 mg/l national limit. With the exception of copper, heavy metals concentrations were below the set limits in all the effluents  CHARACTERIZATION OF TEXTILE INDUSTRIES’ EFFLUENTS 217

(Table 4). Four of the wastewaters (mills 1, 2, 3 
and 4) had copper levels range of between 1.96 
and 5.14 mg/l as against lower set (less than 
1.00) limit. While chromium was not detected in four of the textile effluents, mill 5 effluent had a value of 0.5 mg/l that was still below the standard. Mercury was not detected in all the 
samples tested. 
 
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS AND AIR QUALITY 
IMPLICATIONS 
The most important measure of water quality is 
the dissolved oxygen (Peirce et al ., 1997). The 
low level of DO recorded could result in the non-
maintenance of conditions favourable to the 
aerobic organisms. This could lead to anaerobic organisms taking over with the resultant creation of conditions making the water body uninhabitable to gill-breathing aquatic 
organisms. Hydrogen sulphide is formed under 
conditions of deficient oxygen in the presence of 
organic materials and sulphate (WHO, 2000). This could be a possible reason for the high sulphide measured in the effluents analyzed. The high levels of BOD are indications of the 
pollution strength of the wastewaters. They also 
indicate that there could be low oxygen available for living organisms in the wastewater when utilizing the organic matter present. High COD levels imply toxic condition and the presence of biologically resistant organic substances (Sawyer 
and McCarty, 1978). The settleable and 
suspended solids are high and this will affect the operation and sizing of treatment units. Solids concentration is another important characteristic 
of wastewater (Lee and Lin, 1999). High 218  YUSUFF and SONIBARE

alkalinity increases with wastewater strength. It shows the capacity of wastewaters to neutralize acids, and is undesirable. Heavy metals in the wastewaters could be of negative impact to the environment. Sekhar et al.  
(2003) traced heavy metal contamination of an 
area to industrial effluent. The negative impacts from Kaduna textile mills effluents could be felt as far as all the regions covered by the Kaduna River basin (Figure 1), the main receptor of these 
effluents. Adeniji and Mbague (1990) once 
detected high heavy metal concentration in Jebba and Kainji Lakes and Ita (1994) attributed this to some industries along the rivers Niger and Kaduna. The textile industries which are some of the most active in the city (Kaduna) could be one 
of the sources and this confirms the potential 
dangers associated with  high copper levels 
detected in the effluents analyzed. In Nigeria, climate is determined primarily by the distance from the oc ean to the secondary 
elevation hills and as such, the temperature is 
always warm and precipitation decreases from the coast to the Sahel in the North (Lae et al. , 
2003). While high temperature increases evaporation rate of wastewaters thus polluting the air of an area, washout  effect associated with 
rainfall (Jauregui and Luyando, 1999) which is 
characterized by high precipitation, reduces air 
pollution. The two climatic conditions of the Northern Nigeria under which Kaduna city falls is an indication that adequate efforts should be made to prevent air pollution. The natural 
cleansing of air pollution in the area could be 
low due to low precipitation and associated high wind speed (Figure 3) while the reverse is the case for its air pollution inducing potential (due to high temperature). Akeredolu and Sonibare (1997) once predicted lower ventilation 
coefficient (a natural way of air pollution 
removal) for Kano, a neighboring city to Kaduna. Air pollution of the detected effluents’ parameters could be in gaseous and particulates 
form and the potential threat they pose to the 
environment especially around River Kaduna CHARACTERIZATION OF TEXTILE INDUSTRIES’ EFFLUENTS 219
basins calls for stringent control measure. Of the 
five world air pollution episodes, three of them 
(1930, 1948, and 1952) happened around river-banks (EPA, 2004) suppor ted by temperature 
inversions.  Oil and grease, ammonia, sulphides, and colour, are potential air pollution sources from these 
effluents. Meteorological conditions which 
include wind speed and annual average temperature (EPA, 2002) are important factors.  At any temperature, liquids can evaporate due to higher kinetic energy of some molecules. These 
molecules with higher kinetic energy will be able 
to escape the intermolecular attractive forces in the liquids and enter the gas phase. Evaporation increases as the liquid temperature increases due to the increased number of molecules with the necessary kinetic energy level to escape. This 
confirms that high temperature of Kaduna city 
(Figure 3) especially during the long dry season (Kaduna, 2004) could increase the potential of the discharged effluents from the textile mills to pollute air in the environment. High colour 
associated with these effluents should be 
adequately treated before discharge. The impacts of temperature on diffusivities both in the air and water (EPA 2001) could influence emissions of both ammonia and sulphides detected in the 
effluents while volatilization of oil and grease 
that could be induced by the same high temperature could introduce organic compounds into the environment thus polluting the air.  When the effluents are discharged into the river, heavy metals present can be adsorbed on the 
river’s soil and sediments and during the dry 
season, water evaporation could expose them to the environment. High TSS and TDS detected could be attributed to the high colour (from the various dyestuffs being used in the textile mills) 
and they may be major sources of the heavy 
metals. Increased heavy metals concentrations in river sediments could increase suspended solids concentrations (Kambole, 2003). During the dry season, the occasional dust re-suspension could introduce these metals into the atmosphere along 
with the particulates. With this, they could 
constitute health problems in form of air pollution. Some of the vapours formed above have great potential to nucleate thus becoming particulate problem to the environment. In addition to these are the products of reactions 
between some of the chemicals present in the 
effluents (Soldan, 2003) which may be toxic to the environment. Removal of the pollutants from these effluents is the only sure way of safer environment and this can be achieved by treatment to required level. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The qualities of effluents studied were grossly 
below the set limits by the Federal Ministry of Environment in Nigeria and some world bodies 
like the World Health Organization in four of the 
five textile mills. The effluents are not uniform in characteristics and this may make it extremely difficult to use a central effluent treatment plant as being proposed by the government. Lower levels of some of these parameters in Mill 5 
(with effluent treatment plant) when compared to 
the other four mills (with no effluent treatment plant) indicate that a uniform characteristics is attainable for or all the effluents if a measure of treatment is introduced at Mill level. Lower 
levels of parameters could make the proposed 
central treatment plant cheaper to maintain even at greater efficiency. The results also show that air quality of the area covered by the entire Kaduna river basin could be negatively affected by both the gaseous 
emissions and particulates which could be 
released from the effluents. Meteorological conditions of the area are strong influencing factors. Rainfall appears in Kaduna around May and retreats in September (Odekunle, 2004). The 
associated relatively high wind speed and low 
temperature (Figure 3) during this period could lower air pollution problems but the situation may not be the same for the longer dry season. Incorporation of appropriate heavy metal recovery in the proposed central effluent 
treatment as proposed by Gaballah and Kilbertus 
(1998) could be of great advantage for environmental protection especially around the river banks where animals do concentrate during the dry season in the Northern part of Nigeria 
(Alawa et al., 2002), a region where Kaduna city 
belongs. The impacts around these banks could be much (since it is the final receiving point of the effluents) if adequate measures are not taken before the final discharge.
