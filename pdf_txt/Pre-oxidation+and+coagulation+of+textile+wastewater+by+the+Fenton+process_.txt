Abstract 
 
The oxidation of leachate coming from the compostin g of two organic wastes 
(wastewater sludge and organic fraction of municipa l solid wastes) using the Fenton’s 
reagent was studied using different ratios [Fe 2+ ]/[COD] 0 and maintaining a ratio 
[H 2O2]/[COD] 0 equal to 1. The optimal conditions for Fenton reac tion were found at a 
ratio [Fe 2+ ]/[COD] 0 equal to 0.1. Both leachates were significantly ox idized under these 
conditions in terms of COD removal (77% and 75% for  leachate from wastewater 
sludge composting and leachate from organic fractio n of municipal solid wastes, 
respectively) and BOD 5 removal (90% and 98% for leachate from wastewater sludge 
composting and leachate from organic fraction of mu nicipal solid wastes, respectively). 
Fenton’s reagent was found to oxidize preferably bi odegradable organic matter of 
leachate. In consequence, a decrease in the biodegr adability of leachates was observed 
after Fenton treatment for both leachates. Neverthe less, Fenton reaction proved to be a 
feasible technique for the oxidation of the leachat e under study, and it can be considered 
a suitable treatment for this type of wastewaters.

1. Introduction 
Solid waste management is becoming a global problem  in developed countries. 
In recent years, the international policy on manage ment of organic wastes has been 
increasingly directed towards recycling. There are different technologies to recycle 
organic wastes and composting is often presented as  a low-technology and low-
investment process to convert organic wastes to an organic fertilizer known as compost 
[1]. In Europe, huge amounts of organic municipal s olid wastes and sludge are managed 
in composting facilities where these materials are processed. One of the main problems 
associated with the treatment of organic wastes in composting facilities is the 
management and treatment of leachates, which presen t a high organic load and cannot 
be stored in the plant.  
Among chemical processes the Advanced Oxidation Pro cesses (AOPs) has been 
used to reduce the organic load or toxicity of diff erent waters and wastewaters [2,3]. 
AOPs are based on the generation of hydroxyl free r adicals, which have a high electro-
chemical oxidant potential. Among AOPs the Fenton’s  reagent [4] has been efficiently 
used as a chemical process for wastewater treatment  and pre-treatment [5]. The 
Fenton’s system consists of ferrous salts combined with hydrogen peroxide under acidic 
conditions.  
A wide variety of Fenton’s reagent applications hav e been reported, such as 
treatment of textile wastewaters [2,6], reduction o f Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons 
(PAH) in water [7], removal of Adsorbable Organic H alogens (AOX) from 
pharmaceutical wastewater [8], or treatment of pape r pulp manufacturing effluents [9]. 
Among them, application of the Fenton reaction for the treatment of leachates has been 
recently reported and different conditions for the Fenton reaction have been studied [10-
11]. However, these results have been obtained with  landfill leachate, which is  4
inherently different from composting leachate due t o the aerobic conditions of the 
process and the use of “fresh” and “young” wastes. To our knowledge, there are no 
studies published on the use of the Fenton reaction  to treat leachates from composting 
processes. 
The objective of this work is to study the utilizat ion of the Fenton reaction for 
the treatment of leachates coming from the composti ng of two typical organic wastes: 
wastewater sludge (WS) and organic fraction of muni cipal solid wastes (OFMSW). The 
efficiency of the Fenton process is evaluated in te rms of reduction of organic matter 
load. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Leachate collection 
Different samples of leachates from the composting of wastewater sludge 
(mixed with pruning wastes) and source-selected org anic fraction of municipal solid 
waste were collected from the composting plant of J orba (Barcelona, Spain) during the 
period January-June of 2005. The results of the cha racterization of leachates (Table 1) 
are presented as average values with standard devia tion. A complete description of the 
plant and the composting process can be found in [1 2].  
 
2.2. Analytical procedures 
 Analytical procedures for the determination of che mical oxygen demand (COD), 
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), pH and electrical conductivity were conducted 
according to Standard Methods [13].

2.3. Fenton reaction 
Fenton reaction was performed at 25ºC and atmospher ic pressure. In all the 
experiments, the ratio [H 2O2]/[COD] 0 (g/g) (total COD) was fixed to 1 whereas the ratio  
[Fe 2+ ]/[COD] 0 (mol/mol) was fixed at 0.5, 0.1 and 0.05. Concentr ated hydrogen 
peroxide (33%, Panreac, Barcelona, Spain) was used to minimize the dilution effect 
associated to H 2O2 addition (this dilution effect was considered in t he calculation of 
BOD 5 and COD removal). pH of all samples prior to Fento n reaction was fixed to 3 by 
adding concentrated sulphuric acid. No precipitatio n was observed after pH adjustment. 
All the experimental conditions were performed in t riplicate. Fenton reaction was 
concluded after 60 min, when no reaction was visual ly observed. A detailed description 
of the experimental procedure used to carry out the  Fenton reaction can be found in 
[14]. 
 
2.4. Data analysis  
Statistical significance of replicate values was ca rried out by means of F-test 
(variance analysis) and Student’s t-test (mean anal ysis) both at 5% level of probability.  
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Leachate characterization 
The characterization of leachates from WS and OFMSW  composting are shown 
in Table 1. As expected, both leachates presented a  very high level of COD and BOD 5, 
whereas the ratio BOD 5/COD was around 0.5, which corresponded to a high l evel of 
biodegradability of the organic matter. These resul ts are higher than those found in 
leachates from landfill, which usually present valu es of COD from 5 to 10 g/l and low 
values of biodegradability (ratio BOD 5/COD around 0.1) [10,11]. One possible  6
explanation for this fact is that composting leacha tes consist of particulate and dissolved 
organic matter from fresh and young wastes instead of landfill leachate that is a mixture 
of different aged materials. The high levels of BOD 5 found (in the case of sludge 
composting even higher than that of dissolved COD) indicates that a significant amount 
of particulate organic matter is also degradable. T his is often found when respiration 
tests are carried out with solid wastes or slurries  [15]. Nevertheless, the values found for 
composting leachates are in the range of liquid str eams that are being currently treated 
by AOPs [13,16]. Moreover, given the high values of  COD and BOD 5, a biological 
process to treat composting leachates will not prob ably achieve legal requirements of 
water quality. In relation to pH, however, it must be pointed that the values found in WS 
and OFMSW leachates are far from those considered o ptimal for Fenton reaction, which 
is usually carried out at pH values below 4 [5]. 
 
3.2. BOD 5 and COD reduction by Fenton reaction 
 Fenton reaction was carried out on WS and OFMSW lea chate samples at 
different levels of the ratio [Fe 2+ ]/[COD] 0 (0.5, 0.1 and 0.05), whereas the ratio 
[H 2O2]/[COD] 0 (g/g) was fixed to 1. These experimental condition s were selected since 
they are commonly used in Fenton reaction. For inst ance, Kurt et al. [17] and Kim et al. 
[18] used a ratio [H 2O2]/[COD] 0 equal to 1 for the treatment of different leachate s and 
showed no significant differences in COD removal wh en this ratio was modified around 
the stoichiometric  theoretical value (2), whereas the optimal ratio [F e 2+ ]/[COD] 0 show a 
high variability in different studies treating diff erent wastewaters [5,14,17,18]. 
 Table 2 show the results of COD removal found for Fenton reaction. In both WS 
and OFMSW leachates the optimal ratio [Fe 2+ ]/[COD] 0 was 0.1, which produced a COD 
removal of 77 and 75% for WS and OFMSW, respectivel y. However, it must be pointed  7
that precipitation of hydrated ferric oxides was ob served when using high Fe 2+  
concentrations. In this case, it is probable that s ome of the COD removal may be 
associated to co-precipitation and not properly to Fenton reactions. Nevertheless, these 
results are in accordance to those found for landfi ll leachate [10,11], demonstrating the 
suitability of the Fenton reaction for the treatmen t of leachates from solid wastes with a 
high content of organic matter. 
 To study the effect of Fenton reaction on the biod egradability of composting 
leachates, the BOD 5 removal was studied for the optimal conditions fou nd for COD 
reduction ([Fe 2+ ]/[COD] 0 = 0.1). Results are shown in Table 2. BOD 5 removal for both 
leachates was very high (90 and 98 % for WS and OFM SW respectively). In particular 
the results for BOD 5 removal were higher than those of COD removal. Thi s can be also 
observed in the values of the final ratio BOD 5/COD, which clearly decreased after 
Fenton treatment (Table 2). One possible hypothesis  for this is the fact that Fenton’s 
reagent is likely to oxidize preferably biodegradab le organic matter, which is also the 
major constituent of organic load found in composti ng leachates. These results are 
different from those recently found with mature lan dfill leachates, where Fenton 
treatment produces an increase in leachate biodegra dability (increase in the ratio 
BOD 5/COD from 0.13 to 0.42) [19]. In this case, it is p robable that mature landfill 
leachates are composed of more recalcitrant organic  molecules and consequently a 
Fenton process can break down or rearrange molecula r structures of organic matter and 
convert the non-biodegradable organics to more biod egradable forms. In the case of 
composting leachates, however, the organic compound s of leachate are mostly 
biodegradable and the Fenton process is likely to o xidize these compounds. Anyway, 
the results presented in this work demonstrate the suitability of the Fenton process to  8
reduce organic load of composting leachates with ex tremely high values of COD and 
BOD 5. 
 Obtained results point that, since composting leac hates have a relatively high 
BOD 5/COD ratio, the global treatment process should be composed of a first biological 
process with a posterior treatment with Fenton reac tion. Fenton reaction could be 
proposed therefore as a post-treatment for the comp osting leachate, which have been 
previously treated by biological (aerobic or anaero bic) treatment. Contrarily, with 
landfill leachate, the Fenton reaction should be in cluded in the treatment sequence as a 
pre-treatment [19]. 
  
4. Conclusions 
From the data here presented, we can conclude that:  
1) Leachate from the composting process of two typi cal organic wastes (WS and 
OFMSW) has been characterized in terms of organic l oad. The values found for both 
COD and BOD 5 were extremely high.  
2) The optimal conditions for Fenton reaction were found at a ratio [Fe 2+ ]/[COD] 0 equal 
to 0.1 when the ratio [H 2O2]/[COD] 0 was maintained to 1. Both leachates were 
significantly oxidized under these conditions in te rms of COD removal (77% and 75% 
for WS and OFMSW leachate, respectively) and BOD 5 removal (90% and 98% for WS 
and OFMSW leachate, respectively). 
3) Fenton reaction was found to oxidize preferably biodegradable organic matter of 
leachates, resulting in a significant reduction of the ratio BOD 5/COD for both leachates.  
4) Fenton reaction proved to be a feasible techniqu e for the oxidation of the leachate 
under study, and can be considered a suitable treat ment for this type of wastewaters. 
The use of Fenton reaction, given the high biodegra dability of composting leachate,  9
should be proposed as a post-treatment after biolog ical treatment. The resulting effluent 
may be treated in a municipal wastewater treatment plant. 
5) Further research on the use of the Fenton reacti on to treat composting leachates 
should be focused on the improvement of the effecti veness of the organic matter 
removal by changing experimental conditions or by u sing other AOPs. The study of the 
oxidation of specific organic compounds found in co mposting leachate would be also of 
interest.
