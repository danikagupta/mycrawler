Abstract The paper presents the experimental results collected from seven months of operation of a
combined anaerobic/aerobic system treating an industrial efﬂuent with averaged content of organic matterand nitrogen of 10.4 g COD /L and 790 mg NKT /L, respectively. The system was formed by an upﬂowanaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and an upﬂow biological aerated ﬁlter (UBAF) connected in series, with arecycling line of the UBAF efﬂuent into the UASB for its denitriﬁcation. The best results were obtained whenoperating the two reactors, UASB and UBAF, with hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 3.3 and 1.3 days,respectively, and a recycling ratio of 6.7. Under these conditions the system removed 98% of the organicmatter and ammonia and 91% of the total nitrogen entering the system.
The activity of the different microorganisms was followed through activity assays consisting of measuring
the consumption or production rate of any speciﬁc substrate or metabolism product. Thus when operatingthe system under the aforementioned conditions the reported values for the speciﬁc activity of methanogenicmicroorganims and denitriﬁers coexisting in the UASB were 1.05 g COD/g VS d and 32.08 mg NO3–-N/gVS d, respectively. While the activity of ammonia and nitrite oxidisers within the UBAF were 47.65 and 4.36mg O2 /g VS h, respectively.Keywords Combined systems; nitriﬁcation; denitriﬁcation; UASB; UBAF; industrial wastewater
Introduction
Traditionally the treatment of industrial effluents with high organic matter content has been
pursued in anaerobic biological reactors due to the significant economic and technicaladvantages that can be achieved. The anaerobic treatment has been proved to show a highefficiency for suspended and soluble organic matter removal, however it is inherentlyinadequate for nutrient removal (Speece, 1996). The progressive application of moresevere regulations limiting the discharge of total nitrogen and phosphorous to surface andgroundwater streams is demanding the treatment of anaerobic reactor effluents to fulfil thedischarge limits at the lowest cost. The technologies usually applied for total nutrientremoval are based on a spatial and/or temporal sequence of different anaerobic, anoxic andaerobic steps. Its application for treating anaerobic reactor effluents can be an expensivesolution due to the large operational and installation costs associated with it.
On the other hand, when only organic matter and nitrogen removal is required, the nitri-
fication of effluents previously ammonified in an anaerobic reactor in a subsequent aerobicreactor it does not satisfy the total nitrogen discharge limit in many situations and conse-quently it is no longer a solution. There exists the possibility of integrating the downstreamaerobic stage with the anaerobic reactor by recycling the nitrified effluent to the anaerobicreactor for its denitrification. This type of anaerobic/aerobic system has been proven to besuccessful for removing organic matter and solids from domestic sewage with 95 and 88percent of suspended solids and COD removal respectively (Gonçalves et al. 1999). During
the last decade the performance of different integrated or combined anaerobic/aerobic systems that have been operated for simultaneous removal of organic matter and totalnitrogen (Acítores et al. 1991, Paul et al. 1998, Villaverde et al. 2000, Van Benthum et al.Water Science and Technology Vol 44 No 4 pp 255–262 © IWA Publishing 2001
255Water 44.4 LA35  15/8/01  5:45 pm  Page 2551997, Osashi et al. 1999) has been reported. Some of these configurations operate with
attached biomass in the nitrification phase in order to improve the retention of the slowgrowing nitrifying biomass. (Fdz-Polanco et al. 1996). Nevertheless this option of combin-
ing the anaerobic reactor with a subsequent aerobic stage is often refused due to the lack ofinformation about the performance of combined anaerobic-aerobic systems that operateeffectively for simultaneous removal of organic matter and nitrogen.
The aim of the experimental work presented here was improving the treatment of an
industrial wastewater with a high COD and nitrogen content that was being treated in ananaerobic UASB reactor in order to fulfil the discharge limits for organic matter and totalnitrogen. With this aim an anaerobic-aerobic system was designed, integrated and operat-ed. The system was formed by the former UASB (similar to that employed at industrialscale) to which an UBAF was coupled. Initially this type of combined system was selectedby its technical and economical potential advantages here summarised:1. It produces effluents of very high quality accomplishing the discharge limits for total
nitrogen.
2. The UBAF technology allows for a better usage and control of the oxygen, and for the
recirculation of a nitrified effluent to the UASB with a low oxygen content.
3. The UBAF technology offers some advantages for nitrification such as very high bio-
mass concentration (up to 30 g/L), high biomass retention time operating with lowhydraulic retention time and an excellent behaviour overcoming volumetric or sub-strate overloads.
4. There is also the possibility of treating in the UASB the back-washing waters of the
UBAF and thus mineralising the aerobic excess sludge.
Material and methods
Experimental set-up and experimentation planning
The experimental set-up was formed by two biological reactors, a UASB reactor and aUBAF of 10 and 3 L of volume, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. Both reactors wereconnected in series with a recycling line from the exit of the aerobic reactor to the entranceof the UASB reactor.
The recycling line had a buffer tank of 0.5 L from which the aerobic effluent was
pumped to the UASB entrance and out of the system. A conventional liquid displacementdevice measured the biogas was generated in the anaerobic stage. Both reactors operated ata constant temperature of 33ºC. The industrial wastewater was fed into the UASB reactor

 Figure 1 Experimental set-upWater 44.4 LA35  15/8/01  5:45 pm  Page 256diluted in the recycling line coming from the UBAF. Different biological processes take
place in the: anaerobic removal of organic matter, denitrification of nitrite and nitraterecycled from the UBAF, and hydrolysis to ammonia of the organic nitrogen that enterswith the feed. The effluent of the UASB flowed into the UBAF by gravity, where is mixedwith the air supplied by means of a diaphragm pump and the nitrification of the ammoniaand aerobic oxidation of the organic matter that goes out of the UASB takes place. As aresult of the growth of the aerobic microorganisms, both nitrifiers and heterotrophs, the fil-ter is getting clogging and a periodic wash-out is necessary to remove the excess of biomassand let the biofilter operate in optimum conditions. The frequency of the wash-out dependson the applied load, but in this system varied between 7 and 14 days. The media of thebiofilter consisted of 2 litres of particles of puzzolane with an average diameter of 4 mm.Before the start-up of the reactor, the media was maintained submerged in a nitrifyingmedium to improve the attachment of nitrifiers.
The UASB reactor was filled with 5 L of sludge from the industrial anaerobic reactor
that is treating the same influent. Methanogenic and denitrifying activity was determinedfor this sludge, obtaining a value of the methanogenic activity at 30°C of 0.25 g COD/g VS d, and a denitrifying activity of 10.5 and 4.0 mg N/g VS d at 30 and 20°C respectively.
In order to check the influence over the global behaviour of the system of the ratio
between reactors’ volume, during the last two periods of operation the volume of the reac-tors were modified to 5 and 2 L for the UASB and the UBAF respectively. The media in theUBAF was reduced to 1 L.
The influent of the system consists of a wastewater from a food industry, whose compo-
sition is shown in Table 1.
Analysis and activity tests
All analysis followed standard methods (APHA, 1995). Total organic carbon (TOC) wasdetermined using a SHIMADZU TOC Analyzer 5050.Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen(DO), ammonia nitrogen and redox potential values were determined using selective elec-trodes and anions concentrations (NO
2–, NO3–, and PO4–3) were determined by HPLC.
To follow the evolution of the different microorganisms groups involved in the system,
substrate uptake rates (SUR) of methanogenics, heterotrophs, nitrifiers and denitrifierswere also determined as an indicator of their activity. These activity tests are based onmeasuring maximum rates of substrate utilization per biomass unit (µ
max/Y). Two different
experimental set-ups were employed.
Methanogenic activity . The system consists of a 500 mL digestor connected to a Mariotte
flask filled with an NaOH solution similar to that described by Soto et al. (1993). Methane
produced in the digestor displaced an equivalent liquid volume of the Mariotte flask that isM.L. Lacalle et al.

stant temperature of 33°C.
Other activities . Specific activity of heterotrophs, ammonia and nitrite oxidizers were
determined by closed respirometry. The respirometer consists of a half a litre thermostaticcell provided with inlets for introducing the biomass sample and the different substrates.An Oxymeter ORION 870 connected to a computer was used for recording data. A magnet-ic stirrer provided good mixing conditions inside the cell. The conditions under which thesetests were carried out are described elsewhere (Villaverde et al. 1997). The activity of den-
itrifiers was determined with an experimental set-up similar to that used for respirometryassays and is shown in Figure 2. Prior to the assay oxygen was stripped off the liquid samplewith nitrogen gas. Oxygen concentration in the sample was always under 0.05 mg/L. Theinitial substrate concentration was selected for each test in order to have zero order reactionrate conditions with respect to the substrate (Cech et al. 1984). The ratio between initial
substrate and microorganisms concentrations was smaller than 3 to minimize biomassgrowth during the experiments (Chudoba et al. 1992). The results are expressed as 
milligrams of oxygen (O
2) consumed per gram of volatile solids (VS) and per hour 
(mg O2/g VS·h) for heterotrophs, ammonia and nitrite oxidizers; and as mg 
N-NO3–
red./gVS·d for nitrate reducers.
Results and discussion 
Before both reactors were connected in series, they were operating for 25 days as single
steps. The feed for each reactor was prepared by trying to simulate the operational condi-tion once both reactors were connected. The anaerobic reactor was fed with the industrialwastewater diluted ten times (to simulate recirculation) and 100 mg N-NO
3–/L was added.
The feed for the biofilter was composed by the effluent from the anaerobic reactor in whichammonia concentration was adjusted to 200 mg N-NH
4+/L. From the results obtained in
this period it can be indicated that:
Taking into account that the inﬂuents were diluted, COD reduction was considerable in
both reactors, reaching values around 64% for the UASB and more than 50% for the bioﬁlter.
In the UASB almost a complete transformation of the organic nitrogen to ammonia
(ammonification) took place and although the seed sludge was an anaerobic one, denitrifi-cation occurred from the first day. In the biofilter nitrification efficiencies higher than 90%

 Figure 2 Experimental set-up for aerobic and denitriﬁers activity testWater 44.4 LA35  15/8/01  5:45 pm  Page 258were reached, and although during the first 10 days the final product was nitrite, after that
the nitrification went to nitrate.
Once both reactors were operating according to the desired conditions they were con-
nected. During the operation some conditions were changed and 10 different periods can beconsidered. The operational conditions, mainly organic loading rate (OLR), were similar tothose applied in the industrial UASB. Table 2 shows these periods together with theremoval of organic matter and nitrogen and the flow and composition of the gas generatedin the UASB. Organic loading rate and nitrogen loading rate are shown in Table 3. Fromperiod I to period VIII, HRT reflected in Table 2 is referred to the total HRT in the wholesystem, being the HRT in the UASB 3.3 times the HRT in the biofilter. However for theperiods IX and X both HRT are shown because the volumes of the reactors were slightlychanged and thus the HRT ratio also changed. During the period VI, due to the lack ofindustrial wastewater, the system was fed with a mixture in which organic matter was sup-plied as beet sugar molasses and nitrogen as a mixture of NH
4Cl and (NH4)2SO4with con-
centrations similar to those of the industrial wastewater. After this period the reactor wasstopped for 20 days.
In the experimental period HRT and recirculation/feed ratio (Q
R/QF) were changed. An
increase in QR/QFratio permits a higher nitrogen removal (more nitrate is recirculated to
the UASB), however this parameter is limited by the hydrodynamics in the UASB. Anincrease in upflow velocity (increase in Q
R/QF)can increase the quantity of suspended
solids in the effluent, and can also reduce the level of ammonification.
In order to get good conditions for the nitrification, the aerobic reactor operated with a
dissolved oxygen concentration between 4.5 and 6.5 mg/L. In spite of the recirculation,dissolved oxygen level in the UASB was negligible. Although the pH of the feed increasedduring the operational period from 5.2 to 6.3, the effluent pH of the UASB was very stablearound 7.5, except in the last two periods in which the pH increased to 8.2. A similar behav-iour was observed in the biofilter with a pH around 8.5 except during the last two periods inwhich the pH increases to almost 9.0. Nitrification efficiency in those periods was notaffected by the high pH. This pH variation can be due to the increase in denitrification per-centage that occurred in those periods, together with the increase in recirculation flow.
Figure 3 shows the evolution of ammonia in influent and UASB and UBAF effluents.
Ammonia was detected in the UBAF effluent during the 20 first days of operation, probablydue to the acclimation of the microorganisms to the new operational conditions. Theincrease of ammonia concentration in the UBAF effluent during the period IV was due to asharp increase in the influent flow. Once the flow was decreased to the previous values thereactor showed a favourable behaviour and nitrification started again. Figure 4 showsnitrite and nitrate concentrations in the effluents of UASB and UBAF; as can be observedM.L. Lacalle et al.

For the last period in which the recycle ratio was between 5 and 10, oxidised nitrogen con-centration in UBAF effluent is almost always below 100 mg/L, but this value was evenhigher than 200 mg/L for lower recycle ratios.
After a 20 day stop, some changes were detected in the behaviour of the system.
Nitrification percentage was not affected , but denitrification increased from 60% to morethan 80%, reaching an average value of 91% at the end of the experimental period (Figure5). It must be mentioned that before the stop, ammonia was transformed in the UBAF main-ly to nitrite, but during the first days after the restart-up nitrate was the major oxidised nitro-gen compound. This situation evolved to the former one in a few days, obtaining nitrite inthe effluent. This situation is in accordance with the results of the activity test shown inTable 4 in which can be seen that the activity of the nitrite producing microorganisms is tentimes the activity of the nitrate producers. Heterotrophic activity in the biofilter is very lowbecause organic matter entering the biofilter is also very low.
Methanogenic and denitrifying activity in the UASB (Table 4) increased 4 and 3 times
respectively from the initial to the final ones, obtaining a very high value for methanogenicactivity of the anaerobic sludge (1.05 g COD/g VS d) at the end of the experimental period.
Suspended solids concentration in the final effluent were very low, usually around 
10 mg TSS/L, instead of the concentration of suspended solid in the UASB effluent, which

period, obtaining a very constant percentage of methane around 75% for the whole period,however nitrogen percentage in the gas increased as denitrification did, reaching a valuearound 16%. Carbon dioxide percentage decreased as nitrogen percentage increased,obtaining final values around 7%. Logically, gas production was very dependent on influ-ent flow. According to these values it can be seen that, for this wastewater, recirculation ofthe nitrified effluent and denitrification in the anaerobic reactor did not considerablydecrease the gas quality, and can be used as energy source.
Mass balance
From the data obtained in the period X, COD and nitrogen mass balances can be done inorder to corroborate the material flux. In the mass balance for the nitrogen it has to be takeninto account that the nitrogen present in the influent and not in the effluent, will be denitri-fied or assimilated for microbial growth.
Influent nitrogen = effluent nitrogen + nitrogen in the gas + nitrogen assimilatedN
inf = 726 mg/L (mainly as organic nitrogen)
Neffl= 10 mg NKT/L + 36 mg N-NO2–/L + 15 mg N-NO3–/L = 61 mg N/L
Ngas= 520 mL N2/Lfeed=>20.4 mmol N2/Lfeed => 573 mg N/L
According to these data, 92 mg N/L are employed in biomass growth. Considering a
nitrogen content in the biomass of 8.5%, the biomass yield will be 1080 mg VSS/L, equiva-lent to 1535 mg COD/L. This value for biomass yield is in accordance with the expectedvalues for this system.
For the COD, the soluble COD in the influent will be transformed in CH
4, employed as a
carbon source in denitrification, oxidised in the UBAF, will leave the system with theeffluent or will be transformed into biomass.
Influent COD = effluent COD + COD for denitrification + COD methanised + COD

The COD balance agree within a 10% that can be due to gas losses with the effluent.
According to the balance the biomass yield is 0.1 g VS/g COD which is an acceptable valuefor a system in which an anaerobic degradation of organic matter and denitrification takesplace.M.L. Lacalle et al.

Effective treatment of an industrial wastewater with a high COD and organic nitrogen con-
tent can be achieved with a combined system formed by a UASB and a UBAF. Organicmatter removal was maintained above 95% for the whole operational period, with CODeffluents as low as 190 mg/L. Almost complete hydrolysis of organic nitrogen to ammoniawas achieved, and total nitrogen in the effluent was below 70 mg N/L (13 mg NKT/L and 56 mg NO
x–/L).
As expected the recycle ratio from the aerobic reactor has a great influence over nitrogen
removal in the system because a higher recycle ratio reduces oxidised nitrogen concentra-tion in the effluent. For this system operating with a recycle ratio of 6.7 more than 90% ofnitrogen removal was achieved.
Methane content of the gas produced in the UASB was very constant with an average
value of 75%, the percentage of nitrogen varied with denitrification rate, reaching a valueof 16%. The other measurable gas was CO
2. Due to the high content of methane, the biogas
can be used as energy source, and its quality was not appreciably modified by denitrifica-tion process.
