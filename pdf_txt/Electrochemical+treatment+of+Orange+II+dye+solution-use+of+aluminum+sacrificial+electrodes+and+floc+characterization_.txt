abstract
In this study, hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) bentonite was synthesized by placing 
alkylammonium cation onto bentonite. Acid Red 88 (AR88) removal by hexadecyltrimethylammo-nium (HDTMA) modi
fi
ed bentonite was investigated and the speci
fi
c surface area obtained using 
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis was 49.2
 m2/g for HDTMA-bentonite. However, for natural 
bentonite, it was only 17.4
 m2/g. The effect of main experimental parameters on the removal of 
AR88 (i.e., initial AR88 concentration, contact time, and HDTMA-bentonite mass) was investigated. Also, six isotherm models were applied for evaluation of the equilibrium adsorption; among the mentioned models, fitting the adsorption data on Langmuir isotherm was associated with supe-rior results (maximum monolayer capacity (q
max) was 91.7  mg/g). The results gave the green light 
to the unique usability of the pseudo-second-order kinetics model for the portrayal of adsorption data. Using the intraparticle diffusion model, the identification of the adsorption mechanism pro-cess was done so that the trivial effect of the boundary layer was confirmed. Based on Boyd’s kinetic model, the external mass transport was the foremost reason for the adsorption of water from dye–water mixtures. In addition, there is no study in the literature on the removal of Acid Red 88 dye using HDTMA-bentonite. The obtained results indicated that, through using HDTMA-bentonite, the elimination of acid dyes from aqueous solutions can occur simply and in a short time.

1. Introduction
Generating 
wastewater and polluting the water by it
has been inscribed as a result of the accelerated develop-
ment in industrialization, which has induced different con-cerns [1,2]. Unloading wastewater into water bodies (e.g., rivers, lakes, and oceans) without proper treatment has brought severe harmful and destructive conditions for the environment and subsequently human health [3–6].In the industries, different kinds of dyes are employed. 
These dyes are also appearing in the effluents due to release from some of these industries [7–9]. Dyes are gen-erally non-biodegradable and have good stability against light, heat, and oxidizing agents [10,11]. Dyes, through imparting color to the water bodies and coloring them, make their presence strikingly visible [12–14]. Blockage of the passage of sunlight in the dye contaminated-waters can lead to adverse effects on aquatic diversity [15,16]. 49 A.D. Khatibi et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 271 (2022) 48–57
Above-mentioned issues and problems are created by 
releasing the generated wastewaters of industrial processes 
with remarkable values of dyes when discharged into the 
environment without any prior treatment [17,18].
Therefore, the removal of the dye is a major challenge 
as the treatment of such waste water by traditional treat-
ment methods is not easily carried out and is associated 
with many difficulties [19,20]. These processes are usually 
not economically feasible and energy-efficient, especially 
when the color concentration is low [21]. Hence finding a suitable alternative treatment to overcome all these lim-
itations is of great significance [22]. Although there is no 
doubt about the cost-effectiveness of the adsorption process 
for removal of dyes and treating the dye-containing efflu-
ents, its efficiency is governed by choosing the appropri-ate adsorbent [23,24]; so that the chosen adsorbent should 
exhibit some features, for example, being easily available 
and cheap and could accommodate the acceptance for being 
utilized for treatment industrial efﬂuents [25,26].
Employing the clay mineral has undeniably gained 
more popularity so that it has been broadly utilized as an 
adsorbent for the treatment of contaminated sewage (i.e., 
for removal of dyes, phenolic compounds, and heavy met-
als) [27–29]. In addition to superb specific surface areas mentioned for these substances, they have also excellent exchange capacities; these features give their sorption capa-
bilities to them [30,31]. Two silica tetrahedral sheets with 
a central Al octahedral layer consist of bentonite, which is 
mainly smectite clay [32]. As stated, because of its charac-teristics (relatively high cation exchangeability and specific surface area), the removal of contaminants using bentonite 
is based on ion exchange and adsorption mechanisms [33]. 
Nonetheless, the employment of bentonite for removing 
pollutants is associated with limitations since bentonite has normally a negative basal surface charge, which leads to the occurrence of poor electrostatic interactions [34]. 
However, the structure of this natural bentonite is not sta-
ble and can be damaged by harmful substances originated 
from the liquid in the process of permeation. In order to solve this problem, natural bentonite has been modified by using various chemicals, such as polyacrylate, cetyltrime-
thylammonium bromide (CTAB) (also called the hexadec-
yltrimethylammonium (HDTMA)), H
2SO4 or NaOH, and 
polyethyleneimine and the obtained results demonstrated 
that these modifications not only improved the charac-terizations of natural bentonite but also increased the adsorptive efficiency [35]. However, investigation of the adsorption mechanisms onto these materials has still been limited so far. In addition, there are very few studies on the removal of dyes by HDTMA-bentonite.
Indeed, this study originated from the fact that Iran is 
a country having a huge source of high-quality bentonite clay [3]. However, the use of this material for removing dye from wastewater is still limited so far. Therefore, this work is of particular importance as it provides a solution to use domestic bentonites for removing dye from industrial wastewater and partially contributes to the environmental protection.
Thus, the objective of this study are listed as follows: 
(a) synthesizing the HDTMA-bentonite, (b) the use of HDTMA-bentonite in Acid Red 88 (AR88) dye adsorption experiments, (c) conducting extra experiments for studying the effect of parameters considered in present study (contact time, temperature, pH of solution, initial AR88 concentra-tion, and adsorbent dosage), (d) preforming the kinetic, isotherm, and thermodynamic studies, and (e) studying the recycling and reusability of the HDTMA-bentonite.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
The AR88 dye (chemical structure: C
20H13N2NaO4S, 
molar mass: 400.38 g/mol and λmax: 505 nm) was supplied 
from Alvan Sabet Co., Iran. The chemical structure of AR88 
is shown in Fig. 1. In the experiment, deionized water 
was taken into employment for all sample preparation  
processes.
2.2. Preparation of HDTMA-bentonite
Preparing the HDTMA-bentonite was done by addition 
of bentonite (10 g) into a hexadecyltrimethylammonium 
(HDTMA) solution (50 mL) of known concentration and 
maintaining the obtained mixture in a shaker incubator 
(at 30°C and 150 rpm for 24 h). After centrifugation of the 
mixture, the supernatant was withdrawn, and the remain-ing solid was comprehensively rinsed with distilled water for eliminating residual HDTMA. After placing it in an oven (at 85°C), the modified bentonite was dried. After screening by a 110 mesh sieve, it was stored in a desicca-
tor [33].
2.3. Adsorption processes
Effects of parameters such as HDTMA-bentonite dosage 
(0.2–3 g/L), contact time (10–120 min), and initial AR88 con-
centration (10–100 mg/L) were investigated. The adsorp-
tion experiments were carried out in 250 mL conical flasks 
containing 100 mL AR88 ion solution at 25°C. In order to 
investigate the influence of initial AR88 concentrations on 
the removal of AR88 ions, about 1.5 g/L of freely suspended 
and immobilized biomass was added to various copper 
concentrations (10–100 mg/L) at 90 min, pH 7 and 120 rpm. 
The impact of contact time on the uptake of the AR88 ions was also investigated under the same conditions. At a time, 
interval (10–120 min), the filtrates were withdrawn. In 
this study, the adsorbent dose was first optimized. Then, 
the optimal adsorbent dose was used to perform contact

time and concentration tests. Finally, the adsorbent dose, 
contact time and optimal dye concentration were used to perform the pH test. All tests up to this point were per -
formed at room temperature, which was approximately 30°C. Elimination percentage and adsorption capacity are obtained from Eqs. (1) and (2) [36,37]:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of HDTMA-bentonite
The specific surface area of HDTMA-bentonite was 
49.2 m2/g. The cation exchange capability (CEC) of the 
HDTMA-bentonite was assessed by the ethanol- ammonium 
chloride method; its value was detected to be 137.2 mmol/
kg. As clarified in the above results, the modification with 
HDTMA was associated with a noteworthy development in 
the specific surface area and CEC (specific surface area and 
CEC for natural bentonite was 17.4 m2/g and 81.3 mmol/kg).
Considering scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of 
bentonite and HDTMA-bentonite (Fig. 2a and b), we can observe the un-smooth surface for bentonite. However, due to the very complex surface structure on the broad plane with high micro-island frequency and ragged, broken nano-sized edges across the decreased areas of the basal plane, we could find remarkable characteristics for the adsorp-tion of HDTMA on its surface, as detected. Moreover, obvious changes in its surface could not be distinguished after its modification by HDTMA. In addition, according to energy dispersion spectra, the presence of carbon on the bentonite surface, after modification, was approved.
3.2. Effect of different parameters on dye removal
The effect of HDTMA-bentonite mass on the AR88 
removal percentage exposed in Fig. 3 was indicative of 
developing AR88 removal percent up to the optimal value 
of dosage. Using the dosage greater than the optimum 
value, a substantial change in percent removal was acquired. 
As estimated, for a given initial AR88 concentration, we 
observed a decrease in the equilibrium concentration by an increase in adsorbent dosage, since there will be a develop-
ment in the surface area or a number of adsorption sites by 
increasing the adsorbent dosage [38,39].
The study was also performed using bentonite and the 
results showed that the optimal contact time was obtained in 150 min while the removal percentage was 76%. The 
higher percentage of dye removal by HDTMA-bentonite 
than bentonite is due to the higher specific surface area of 
modified bentonite and the different functional groups on 
the modified adsorbent surface.
The efficiency of AR88 adsorption onto HDTMA-
bentonite at different contact times was investigated (Fig. 4). During the first 45 min, reasonably rapid adsorption hap-
pened, and a slower stage was detected by increasing time until attainment of equilibrium time. The removal curves are 
single, smooth, and continuous; this signifies that there is a 
probability of forming monolayer coverage of AR88 at the 
outer surface of the evaluated adsorbent. The results illumi-
nate that 90 min can be selected as the equilibrium time for 
conducting the rest of the batch experiments. Describing the 
relatively high removal of AR88 is carried out based on the 
presence of an enormous number of vacant sites for AR88

adsorption. However, it reaches a constant value after a 
while, and further removal of dye from the solution could not be observed [40].
The obtained data exhibited that as the concentration 
of the target pollutant was increased from 10 to 100 mg/L, 
an enhancement in AR88 adsorption capacity of HDTMA-bentonite from 4.975 to 40.19 mg/g was sensed, which is 
ascribed to a high-mass transfer force [41]. Nonetheless, the saturation of binding sites onto the HDTMA-bentonite has resulted in the diminishing AR88 percent removal from 99.5 to 80.39 (Fig. 4) [42].
The adsorption process is strongly influenced by the pH 
of the solution, which affects the carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups on the surface of the adsorbent. Determination of the equilibrium adsorbed amount of Acid Red 88 (AR88) dye (q
e) and removal of these dyes; performed at room tem-
perature at an initial AR88 dye concentration of 10 mg/L 
and using 2 g/L HDTMA-bentonite as the adsorbent. The 
adsorption of AR88 dye was studied at pH values between 3 and 11 for 2 h and pH changes are shown in Fig. 5. For 
AR88 dye removal using HDTMA-bentonite, it can be seen in Fig. 5 that the highest AR88 dye removal (99.5%) occurred at pH = 3. In the AR88 dye removal study, contin-
uously increasing the pH from 3 to 11 caused the adsorp-tion rate to decrease from 99.5% to 49.2%. Considering the studies on azo dye removal, Khaled et al. [43], in their Direct Yellow 12 dye removal study, found that the adsorp-tion efficiency decreased from 98.1% to 11.1% by increasing the pH of the solution from 1.5% to 11.1%. The presence of excess OH ions in a high pH solution reduces adsorption efficiency as they compete with the anions of AR88 dye, an anionic dye, for adsorption sites. In addition, the HDTMA-bentonite adsorbent aims to adsorb OH ions with high concentration and high mobility more than dye anions.
The pH value at which the adsorbent surface is electri-
cally neutral can be determined by determining the point of zero charge (pH
PZC) [44]. To find out pHPZC, the experi-
ments were performed at different pH ranges from 2 to 11 
using 2 g/L of adsorbent and stirred on a magnetic stirrer. 
As shown in Fig. 6, the pHPZC of HDTMA-bentonite was 
determined to be 6.2. At solution pH > pHPZC, the HDTMA-
bentonite surface is negatively charged and electrostatic repulsive forces form between it and negatively charged 
anionic dyes. The test results obtained confirm this.
3.3. Adsorption isotherms
Adsorption isotherms are valuable for optimizing the 
use of adsorbents. Through the fitting, of the data to dif-
ferent isotherm models, the analysis of the isotherm data is carried out, which is considered an imperative step for providing a competent model that can be helpful for design purposes.

The following equation is related to linear form of 
Freundlich isotherm [49,50]:

where 1/n points to the adsorption intensity in which for 
1/n less than 1, the adsorption is favorable, and for its value greater than 1, the process is unfavorable.

where A and B are Harkin–Jura constants. Harkin–Jura equa-
tion considers multilayer adsorption in terms of heterogene-
ity in the distribution of pores.

Sorption energy, E, can be evaluated from K thus [55]:

where qm may also symbolize the total specific micropore vol-
ume of the sorbent or the theoretical adsorption capacity.
3.3.6. Redlich–Peterson model
This model, which is employed for demonstrating 
adsorption equilibrium for a wide range of concentrations, 
has the usability for both homogeneous and heteroge-
neous systems because of its flexibility; this can be enlight-
ened by following Eq. (11) [56,57]:

3.4. Error function
In addition to the usual way of validating kinetics models 
using the linear regression method, the sum of square error 
(SSE), is also employed in this study to determine the best fitting kinetics and isotherms.
The error function is given by [58]:
SSE exp  cal=∑−()qq

 (12)
The number of data points was shown by N.The results of AR88 adsorption were correlated using 
the six isotherm models. The fit of the model with the experimental results was evaluated using linear regres-sion analysis, as seen in Table 1. Thus, it is noted that the R
2 obtained from the Langmuir isotherm was the highest. 
Such a high value indicated that the Langmuir isotherm was the best model for AR88 adsorption, suggesting monolayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface. Similar results were found in the removal of manganese from water by electrocoagulation and removal of ciprofloxacin from water by powdered activated carbon [52,59]. Also, the error coef-ficient for this model is lower than other models, which confirms the results. The value of R
L is <1, indicating that 
the adsorption of AR88 is favorable in the study case. The (1/n) value in the Freundlich isotherm model is less than 
unity. This means that the adsorption process is preferred, the surface is heterogeneous, and there are fewer interac-tions between the adsorbed ions. The values of Dubinin–Radushkevich constant and are given in Table 1. For AR88 ions adsorption, the calculated value mean adsorp-tion energy was 0.941 kJ/mol. It exhibited that AR88 ion 
adsorption was physical adsorption process.

adsorption capacities, and the comparison is presented in 
Table 2.
3.5. Adsorption kinetics
The illustration of the adsorption mechanism can be car -
ried out by fitting adsorption data. The linear pseudo-first- 
order rate equation could be given as Eq. (13) [60]:
log□.qq qKtet e l og () =1
2303 (13)
The pseudo-second-order equation could be expressed as 
Eq. (14) [61]:
t
q Kqt
qt e e=+1
22 (14)
Moreover, K1 (1/h) is the rate constant of pseudo-first- 
order and K2 (g/mg·h) symbolizes the rate constant of 
pseudo- second-order adsorption processes, respectively. 
The fitting curves by the pseudo-first-order model were 
exemplified in Fig. 7 in the supplementary data. In addition, the fitting curves by the pseudo-second-order model were 
documented in Fig. 8. The kinetic parameters are summa -
rized in Table 2. R2 values obtained were notable (higher than 
0.935) at different concentrations for both models. However, 
comparing the theoretical and experimental qe, revealed that 
there is a wide gap between the qe values obtained from the 
pseudo-first-order model (2.14–24.9 mg/g) and experimental 
qe values (4.975–40.19 mg/g) for all concentrations studied 
(Table 3). For the pseudo-second-order model, the calcu-lated q
e values (4.26–38.73 mg/g) were in close consistency 
with the experimental values (Table 3).
Therefore, it was observed that the pseudo-second- 
order model was found to be statistically significant based 
on the higher values of coefficient of regression and lower values of SSE error compared to the values obtained for the pseudo-first-order model.
Following equation is related to intraparticle diffusion 
model [62]:
qK tCtd=+12/ (15)
Plotting qt vs. t1/2 gives a line; passing through the 
obtained line from origin illuminates that only intraparti-cle diffusion is the rate-limiting step. However, the lack of passing through of the line is inactive of participation of film 
diffusion in the process; this offers the idea of the thickness of the boundary layer. According to Fig. 9, which shows the intraparticle diffusion plots, two stages can be considered for the adsorption process, which include a quick stage at the beginning and a gradually slower stage until achiev-ing the adsorption equilibrium over adsorption time. This shows that both intraparticle diffusion and the film diffusion 
control the studied process.
The Boyd plot can forecast the actual slow step, which 
is included in the adsorption process. Eq. (16) is related to Boyd kinetic [63]:
BF Fq
qt=− −− = () 04977 1
0.l n  (16)
where q0 is representative of the amount of studied pollutant 
adsorbed at infinite time (mg/g). qt symbolizes the amount 
of AR88 adsorbed at any time t (min), F signifies the fraction 
of solute adsorbed at any time t. B shows the mathematical 
function of F. The Boyd plots, provided in Fig. 10, illumi-nate that, for all the examined dye concentrations, the plots are linear. Based on the suggestions of the Boyd plots, the Table 1

the plots were linear and do not pass through the origin).
3.6. Thermodynamic studies
To demonstrate the thermodynamic behavior of AR88 
ions adsorption process, thermodynamic parameters such as 
ΔG° as well as ΔS° and ΔH° change can be determined. Table 4  
shows the changes of ΔS° and ΔH° calculated from the 
intercept and slope of lnK against 1/T plot, respectively [63].
∆GR Tkc°= ln  (17)
lnKS
RH
RTc=−°°∆∆ (18)
∆∆ ∆ GH TS °= °− °    (19)
The ΔG° measures the spontaneity of the adsorption 
process, with a higher negative value indicating more 
powerfully favorable adsorption. The thermodynamic fea-sibility and spontaneous nature of AR88 adsorption pro-cess on HDTMA-bentonite are confirmed by the negative ΔG° values [64]. The values of ΔG° decrease from –4.45 to –10.71 kJ/mol, respectively, as the temperature, rises from 
293 to 323 K (Table 3). The decline in the values of ΔG° as 
temperature rises shows that adsorption is less feasible at higher temperatures. The adsorption of AR88 ions was of an endothermic nature, as evidenced by the positive ΔH° values. Furthermore, the improved randomness during the AR88 adsorption at the interface of solid/solution is indicated by the positive ΔS° values (Table 4).
3.7. Regeneration studies
The adsorption of AR88 dye is a reversible process, 
hence the saturated HDTMA-bentonite can be regenerated and reused for adsorption. The efficiency of regenerated 
HDTMA-bentonite is checked by conducting the experi-ments at 10 mg/L of initial AR88 concentration. The regen-
erated HDTMA-bentonite was applied in six consecutive cycles of adsorption/desorption. The adsorption amount presented was consistent through the cycles and experienced the adsorption capacity decreased by 19.2% after six gener -
ations which suggests it may be used as a sustainable AR88 dye removal (Fig. 11).
3.8. Test with real textile industry sewage
This study was performed using synthetic wastewa-
ter, but finally a test was performed for textile wastewater 
with an initial COD of 620 mg/L and the results showed 
that after 120 min of contact time, 71% reduction in the 
amount of COD is observed. The experiments were per -
formed at the optimum absorbent dose of 2 g/L at pH 5 and 
temperature 30°C.Table 3

4. Conclusion
This work focuses on the removal of AR88 using 
HDTMA-bentonite. The effect of different parameters was 
investigated in batch experiments. Thermodynamics anal-yses indicate that the AR88 sorption is feasible, sponta-neous, and endothermic with enthalpy and entropy equal to 53.2 kJ/mol and 0.189 kJ/mol. K, respectively. Kinetic studies 
revealed that the adsorption process follows pseudo- second-
order due to the higher regression coefficient and lower error coefficient. The optimum conditions were obtained at AR88 concentration of 10 mg/L, HDTMA-bentonite dose 2 g, solution pH 3, equilibrium time 90 min, and temperature 
30°C, giving the highest percentage of AR88 removal 99.5%. The adsorption isotherms of AR88 were also compared with popular models, and it was found that the AR88 uptake was well-described by the Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacities of 91.7 mg/g. The adsorption study 
revealed that HDTMA-bentonite is an effective, promising, and highly reusable sorbent for removal contaminants like dye from wastewater with low cost.
