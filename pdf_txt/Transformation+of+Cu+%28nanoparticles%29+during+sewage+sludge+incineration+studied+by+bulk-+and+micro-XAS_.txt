Engineered  nanoparticles ( NP) are well retained during wastewater treatment 
(WWT) and accumulate in the sewage sludge . In Switzerland sewage sludge is  
mostly digested  and incinerated preferably in mono -combustion facilities for 
volume  reduction and energy recovery. The resulting ash is landfilled for 
potential phosphate  recovery  in the future. Previous studies suggested that 
CuO-NP transform into Cu -sulfides  during the WWT  and in environments  with 
comparable redox conditions (Donner et al., 2011; Gogos et al., 2017; Ma et al., 
2014)  but did not address further Cu tra nsformation during sludge incineration.  
We spiked CuO -NP or dissolved  Cu to digested sewage sludge and reacted the 
sludge under mesophilic, anaerobic conditions  for 24 h. Sludge aliquots were  
collected and freeze dried for solid-phase analysis. The remaining sludge was 
dried at 105 °C overnight and incinerated in a pilot- bubbling bed type fluidized 
bed incinerator . To determine the speciation of Cu in the spiked sludges and 
ashes, the homogenized s ludge and ash  samples  were prepar ed as 7 -mm 
diameter pellets for bulk EXAFS analysis at the SuperXAS beamline at the 
Swiss Light Source (SLS, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen). To assess the 
distribution and speciation of Cu at the micrometer -scale , the undisturbed 
samples were embedded  in resin and cut into thin sections (30 µm) on Si -
wafers. These sections were investigated at the microXAS beamline at the SLS. 
One 500×500 µm2 area was mapped by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) with a 3 ×3 
µm2 spatial resolution  at an incident photon ene rgy of 18 keV to assess the 
spatial distribution of Cu and other elements (Fe, Ce, etc.). On the same area, 7 
XRF maps were recorded at incident photon energies around the Cu K-edge to 
obtain spatially -resolved information on Cu speciation.  
Linear combination fit (LCF) analysis of the bulk-EXAFS spectra indicate d 
complete sulfidation of Cu spiked in dissolved form to digested sludge  after 24  h 
reaction time , whereas a minor fraction (8%) of the spiked CuO -NP were still 
present in the digested  CuO-NP-spiked sludge  (Fig. 1) . LCF analys is of the ash 
samples indicated that  incineration lead to a significant change in Cu speciation 
which was  independent of the initially spiked form of Cu. The respective EXAFS 
spectra were  described as a com bination of about 33% amorphous CuS , 33% 
tenorite (CuO) , 17% copper sulphate (CuSO 4) and 17% cupro spinel (CuFe 2O4) 
(Fig. 1) . A preliminary analysis of the  spatially -resolved measurements  revealed 
an uneven distribution  of individual  Cu species in the sludge and ash samples . 
Whether CuO -NP spiked to digested sludge and the corresponding ashes 16th Swiss Geoscience Meeting, Bern 2018  
 
resulted in distinct distribution patterns in terms of Cu concentration or bonding 
environment is currently under investigation.
