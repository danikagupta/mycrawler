Management of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
Alan D. Enriquez, MD, and Martin E. Goldman, MD
ABSTRACT
Background: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is clinically defined as unexplained myocardial hypertrophy, and it is an
autosomal dominant disease of the cardiac sarcomere. It is present in 1 in 500 in the general adult population, making it themost common genetic cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiology of HCM is complex, leading to significant variability in
clinical presentation. This, combined with the lack of randomized trials, makes the management of these patients difficult.
Findings: The majority of patients with HCM are asymptomatic without a substantial reduction in survival. However, a
considerable portion of patients will experience significant symptoms and HCM-related death, and effective therapies are
available for these patients. Patients may have symptoms of heart failure from outflow tract obstruction and/or restrictive
physiology. Medical therapy targeted at the underlying pathophysiology should be used, and surgical myectomy or alcohol septalablation is available for those with refractory symptoms. While the overall risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is low in HCMpatients, some are at elevated risk for and experience SCD, a devastating outcome in young patients. Risk stratification for SCD
and treatment with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators is paramount. Many HCM patients will also develop atrial fibrillation,
and this is often poorly tolerated. A rhythm control strategy with antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation is often necessary, andanticoagulation should be administered to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. Finally, family members of patients with HCM
should be regularly screened with electrocardiography and echocardiography.
Conclusions: HCM is a complex disease with heterogeneous phenotypes and clinical manifestations. The management of
HCM focuses on reducing symptoms of heart failure, preventing SCD, treating atrial fibrillation, and screening family members.Treatment should be tailored to the unique characteristics of each individual patient.

It was first described in the late 1950s by Brock andTeare. In 1990, the first mutation in a gene encodingthe
b-myosin heavy chain in familial HCM was iden-
tified,2and it is now recognized that HCM is a genetic
disease of the cardiac sarcomere with an autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance. The prevalence inthe adult general population is 0.2% (1:500) withapproximately 600,000 affected in the United States,making HCM the most common genetic cardiovascu-lar disease.

HCM is diagnosed when echocardiography or cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging reveals unexplainedleft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), usually /C2115 mm.3
Although asymmetric septal hypertrophy is most com-
mon, there is significant heterogeneity in the degree andpattern of LVH.
4In addition, there is considerable vari-
ability in the clinical presentation, natural history, and
prognosis in patients with HCM. Although HCM diseaseexpression usually occurs during adolescence or youngadulthood, it can occur at any time as late onset disease hasbeen described with certain gene mutations.
5,6Although
the majority of patients are asymptomatic, others areafflicted with incapacitating dyspnea or suffer sudden car-diac death, a devastating outcome in young patients.
7This
heterogeneity combined with the limited exposure of cli-
nicians to HCM has led to controversy in managing pa-tients with HCM.
8,9This review focuses on the current
management of patients with HCM.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLINICAL
MANIFESTATIONS
The majority of patients with HCM are asymptomatic,
and the diagnosis is often made incidentally or duringfamily screening.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2013.12.004very well with survival comparable to the general popu-
lation.7,11However, up to 25% of patients will develop
significant symptoms or HCM-related death.7Patients
can present with multiple symptoms due to a complexinterplay of multiple factors ( Fig. 1 ), but there are pri-
marily three pathways of clinical progression:
1. Heart failure with exertional dyspnea, chest pain, or a
combination of the two. This is due to left ventricularoutflow (LVOT) obstruction, diastolic dysfunctionwith restrictive physiology, or both.
2. Sudden cardiac death (SCD). Myocardial fibrosis
combined with ischemia due to microvascular diseasemay predispose patients with HCM to ventriculartachyarrhythmias.
12,13The incidence of SCD is /C201%
per year in the HCM population, but it is devastating
as it generally occurs in asymptomatic or mildlysymptomatic young patients without warning.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AF). AF develops in w2 0 %o fp a -
tients with HCM and is associated with an increased riskfor stroke, heart failure, and death.
14,15More than 20%
of these patients will suffer from thromboembolism.
MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTROPHIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY
The management of patients with HCM is directed at
control of heart failure symptoms, prevention of SCD,treatment of AF, and screening of family members.Figure 2 depicts treatment strategies for each clinical
scenario in patients with HCM.
Heart Failure with LVOT Obstruction
Seventy percent of patients have dynamic LVOTobstruction at rest or provoked with exercise.
16,17Of
these patients, w10% will progress to New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms and requiretherapeutic intervention.
16,18Pharmacologic Therapy
b-Adrenergic antagonists, verapamil, and disopyramide
are the mainstays of medical therapy in HCM with
outflow tract obstruction.3These agents improve LVOT
obstruction and symptoms by slowing the heart ratethereby improving left ventricular (LV) filling, decreasingmyocardial oxygen demand, or through negative ino-tropic effects.
b-Adrenergic antagonists. It was first recognized
thatb-blockers are efficacious in patients with obstructive
HCM in the 1960s.19Subsequent studies with pro-
pranolol demonstrated a reduction in outflow gradients(particularly with exercise), the alleviation of dyspnea,
chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, and syncope.
20,21
b-Blockers are considered first-line therapy for the treat-
ment of symptomatic patients with obstructive HCM.3
Calcium-channel blockers. Non-dihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) also improve symptoms
in obstructive HCM. Verapamil is the most well-studiedand most widely used CCB, and it decreases restingoutflow gradients and improves diastolic function.
22,23
However, verapamil has vasodilatory effects, and adversereactions such as hypotension, exacerbation of outflowgradients, and pulmonary edema have been reported.
24
Because of this, verapamil is only recommended as
second-line therapy, and should be used with caution in
patients with high LVOT gradients, pulmonary hyper-tension, or advanced heart failure.
3Diltiazem is also used
but has not been well studied.
Disopyramide. Disopyramide is a class 1a anti-
arrhythmic agent, and it exerts negative inotropic effectsby altering Na
þ-Caþexchange.25It has been shown to
alleviate resting outflow gradients and improve heart failuresymptoms, perhaps to a greater degree than
b-blockers.26,27
Because disopyramide can increase atrioventricular (AV)nodal conduction leading to faster ventricular rates during

with a b-blocker or CCB.14Disopyramide is considered
third-line therapy and should be used when b-blockers or
verapamil fail to control symptoms.Medications to be avoided or used with cau-
tion. Vasodilators such as nifedipine, nitrates, and
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can causevenodilation, a fall in systemic vascular resistance, or a

obstruction and lead to hypotension and worsening of
heart failure symptoms. Similarly, digoxin should beavoided because of the positive inotropic effect. Diuretics,on the other hand, may be useful in patients withpersistent symptoms despite treatment with
b-blockers or
verapamil.3However, they should be administered with
caution in patients with LVOT obstruction.
Nonpharmacologic Treatment of
Outflow Obstruction in HCM
In the vast majority of patients, symptoms can be managed
with medical therapy, as only 5% of patients will requireinvasive therapy for symptom control.
28Nevertheless, a
group of HCM patients will have refractory symptoms onmaximal medical therapy and will be candidates for sur-gical myectomy, alcohol septal ablation, or a dual-chamberpacemaker. Septal reduction therapy with myectomy oralcohol septal ablation is indicated in patients with dys-
pnea (NYHA class III or IV), chest pain, or syncope re-
fractory to medical therapy and the presence of LVOTgradient /C2150 mm Hg at rest or provoked with exercise.
3
Surgical Myectomy
Historically, surgical myectomy has been the gold stan-
dard for the relief of LVOT obstruction in patients withHCM. Partial-thickness septal myectomy was first per-
formed in the early 1960s, and transaortic septal myec-
tomy, often extended toward the apex, is now thestandard surgical treatment for obstructive HCM.
29If
valvular or subvalvular anomalies are present, these alsocan be corrected during the surgery.
Perioperative mortality. Early studies described
high operative mortality rates of 4% to 6%, reflecting theinitial surgical inexperience.
30More recent studies from
experienced centers have shown that myectomy can beperformed safely and with perioperative mortality rates of/C201%.
31-33
Complications. Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are
a serious complication of myectomy that may be morecommon in patients with only a mildly hypertrophiedseptum.
34However, these occur in /C201% with the use of
intraoperative echocardiography.21,29,35Complete heart
block requiring a permanent pacemaker (PPM) occurs in
only 1% to 2% if the patient does not have a pre-existingright bundle-branch block.
29,36
Long-term outcomes. The LVOT gradient is nearly
abolished in almost all patients with HCM (90%-95%)
after myectomy.30-33Also, mitral regurgitation is usually
virtually absent after myectomy without the need foradditional mitral valve surgery.
37There is also significant
improvement in heart failure symptoms after myectomywith most patients experiencing NYHA class I-II symp-toms after surgery.
31-33Myectomy is associated with excellent long-term
survival when performed at experienced centers. In two
series, 1- and 10-year survival rates were 98% and 83%,respectively, and similar to matched controls.
28,31There
also may be a lower incidence of SCD after myectomy,possibly due to relief of LVOT obstruction and regres-sion of LVH and LV mass after the procedure.
31,38-40
Alcohol Septal Ablation
Transcatheter ablation of the septum with ethanol was
first performed in 1994, and its use has grown dramat-
ically since then.41It involves coronary angiography and
injection of ethanol directly into the proximal septalperforators supplying the hypertrophied anteroseptum,causing a directed myocardial infarction.
18,42This results
in a reduction in LVOT gradient and symptoms throughLV remodeling, regression of LVH, and induction ofasynchrony.
43-45
Complications. Procedure-related mortality for alcohol
septal ablation has been reported at up to 4% but is
around 1% to 2% at experienced centers.18,46Septal
ablation induces a myocardial infarction encompassing upto 10% of the overall LV mass, and there has been concernthat this scar could act as a substrate for ventriculararrhythmia.
28Although ventricular arrhythmias occur in
w5% of patients during hospitalization, a recent study did
not show a higher risk for SCD.47,48The most common
complication of alcohol septal ablation is AV block, with
10% to 20% of patients experiencing persistent complete
heart block requiring a PPM.46,49
Clinical outcomes. As with myectomy, the compli-
cation rate and clinical outcomes are dependent on theexperience of the operator. At experienced centers, it issuccessful in 75% to 80% of patients, and approximately8% will require repeat intervention.
46,48Observational
studies of alcohol septal ablation show that the reductionin outflow gradient and improvement in symptoms are
comparable to surgical myectomy. However, it may take
up to 3 months for the benefits to become clinicallyapparent.
50Survival after alcohol septal ablation is also
excellent. Two studies with 5- and 10-year follow-up,respectively, found that survival after ablation is compa-rable to myectomy and to an age- and sex-matchedpopulation.
48,51
Surgical Myectomy versus Alcohol
Septal Ablation
Septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation are both
performed in clinical practice, and the clinical eligibility
criteria are the same for both according to the 2011American College of Cardiology/American Heart Asso-ciation (ACC/AHA) guidelines (see earlier mention).
3
In order to minimize the risk for VSD, patients under-going ablation or myectomy should have a septal thick-ness/C2116 mm and /C2118 mm, respectively.
21,49Despite38 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathyidentical indications, alcohol septal ablation is currently
used significantly more often than septal myectomy.28
There are no randomized trials comparing the 2
approaches. Meta-analyses suggest no difference inmortality or symptomatic improvement, but myectomyresults in lower LVOT gradients and a much lower rateof complete heart block requiring pacemaker implanta-tion.
52,53Table 1 summarizes the advantages and dis-
advantages and differences between myectomy and
alcohol septal ablation.
Myectomy is considered first-line therapy for medi-
cally refractory HCM with LVOT obstruction.3This is
because of its very low perioperative mortality, highersuccess rates, lower risk for PPM implantation, andavailability of long-term efficacy data. Myectomy shouldbe performed in younger patients (especially in those/C2040 years old), patients with massive hypertrophy, and
those with concomitant valvular or other cardiac disease.
Alcohol septal ablation is ideally for patients who are notsurgical candidates (eg, elderly individuals).
As with any choice, patient preference is of utmost
importance in the decision-making process, and a thor-ough discussion of the risks and benefits of each treat-ment modality should be undertaken. It is important toreiterate that experienced operators should perform these
interventions, and local availability of each service may
govern clinical decision making.
Dual-Chamber Pacing
Observational studies in the 1990s reported that dualchamber (DDD) pacing with short AV delays couldrelieve subaortic gradients and treat severe heart failuresymptoms by inducing asynchrony.
54However, subse-
quent randomized trials showed that only a small num-
ber of patients actually benefit and that prior reportedimprovements were due to a significant placebo effectwith pacemaker implantation.
55,56In light of this evi-
dence, the 2011 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend thatDDD pacing should only be considered if a patient has
an existing device or has refractory symptoms with
LVOT obstruction and is not a candidate for septalreduction therapy.
3
HEART FAILURE WITHOUT LVOT
OBSTRUCTION AND END-STAGE HCM
Patients without LVOT obstruction and normal LV
function may develop symptoms of heart failure due torestrictive physiology and diastolic dysfunction. In thissetting,
b-blockers and verapamil also may be used to
control the heart rate and to improve ventricular filling,
withb-blockers again considered first-line therapy.3Dis-
opyramide does not have a role in nonobstructive HCM,and diuretics may be used more aggressively in thissetting. A small ( w5%) but important subset of patients
will progress to end-stage or “burned-out ”HCM char-
acterized by thinned myocardium, left ventricular dila-tion, and systolic dysfunction.
57,58These patients should
receive guideline-directed medical therapy for heart fail-
ure.3This is the only subgroup of patients with HCM
for which cardiac transplantation may be considered.
SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are thetreatment of choice for the prevention of SCD in pa-tients with HCM.
59The data supporting the efficacy of
ICDs in these patients come from observational studiesillustrating the rate of SCD and appropriate ICD therapyin high-risk patients with an ICD.
60-62The largest of
these studies included 506 patients and showed that
appropriate ICD therapy is frequent with an annual rateof 5.5% and that ICDs are effective in terminatingventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation despitethe complex HCM phenotype.

Available follow-up >50 y w15 yAnnals of Global Health 39Risk Stratification
Because of the unpredictable nature of SCD in patients
with HCM, identifying patients at high risk for SCD is ofutmost importance. Many risk markers for SCD havebeen studied with varying positive predictive values.There is universal agreement that patients with HCMwho survive sudden cardiac arrest or have episodes ofsustained ventricular tachycardia should receive second-
ary prevention ICDs.
3,63,64
Established Risk Markers
Family history of sudden death. A family history
of HCM-related SCD is associated with an increased riskfor death in affected family members. The risk isparticularly high if there are multiple SCD events in onefamily and if the events occur at a young age.
65,66
Syncope. Syncope, if not attributable to another
cause, is a risk factor for SCD in patients with HCM.67
The risk is highest if syncope occurs with exertion, isrepetitive, or occurs in children.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Nonsus-
tained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is considered arisk marker for SCD, although not all studies have
shown that it is an independent risk factor for SCD.
3
Intuitively, more weight should be placed on more
frequent, faster, and longer episodes of NSVT. Its posi-tive predictive value may be greatest in those aged /C2030
years.
68,69
Massive LV hypertrophy. Approximately 10% of
patients with HCM will have LV wall thickness /C2130
mm.70,71In a study of 480 patients, the risk for SCD
was 0% for a wall thickness /C2015 mm and 1.8% per year
for a wall thickness /C2130 mm.70Moreover, the incidence
of SD nearly doubled for each 5 mm increase in wall
thickness.
Abnormal blood pressure response to exer-
cise. Between 20% and 40% of patients with HCM fail
to augment their blood pressure (BP) during exercise,likely due to outflow obstruction and autonomicdysfunction.
72In one study, 15% of patients with an
abnormal BP response with exercise ( <20 mm Hg in-
crease in systolic BP at peak exercise or a decrease of
more than 20 mm Hg from peak value during exercise)
suffered SCD compared with 3% of those with a normalresponse.
72
Potential Risk Markers
There are a number of features in HCM that have apossible but unclear association with SCD. These maybe useful as arbitrators in resolving debates as to whethera patient should be offered preventative therapy for SCDon a case-by-case basis.
LV apical aneurysm. Whereas LV apical aneurysms
are rare in patients with HCM (2%, especially in patientswith apical or mid-wall hypertrophy), one study reported
an incidence of SCD/ICD therapy of 3.6% per year in
this population.
73
LVOT obstruction. LVOT obstruction is recognized
as an independent predictor of progression to severeheart failure symptoms or death.
40However, not all
studies have shown an increased risk for SCD with sig-nificant LVOT obstruction.
40,74
Late gadolinium enhancement on CMR. Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on CMR corresponds
to myocardial fibrosis, and some studies have shown that
LGE is associated with an increased risk for SCD.75,76
However, the positive predictive value of LGE for SCDis low, likely because up to 60% of all patients withHCM will have LGE on CMR. Emerging evidencesuggests that the extent of LGE rather than simply thepresence of LGE is predictive of SCD, and currentstudies will better define the utility of LGE in the near
future.
1,77
High-risk genotype. There may be high-risk geno-
types for SCD, but the available data have been contra-dictory, likely because of variable penetrance.
78This,
combined with the vast number of identified mutations(in addition to unidentified mutations), make genotypingfor risk stratification clinically impractical.
79
Selection of High-Risk Patients for ICD
Implantation
Identifying which patients with HCM will benefit from
ICD implantation remains difficult. Conventional riskfactors were generally studied in patients between theages of 18 and 50, and it is important to recognize that
the risk for SCD is very low in HCM patients /C2160 years
of age.
80Also, although each of the risk factors is asso-
ciated with a very high negative predictive value ( /C2190%),
they are limited by positive predictive values in the rangeof only 15% to 30%.
13The number of patients with only
1 risk factor ( w15%-35%) exceeds the number of pa-
tients with 1 risk factor who will have SCD. Thus, theadoption of a policy of ICD placement for all HCM
patients with 1 risk factor would result in the implanta-
tion of unnecessary devices, often in young people whoare much more likely to experience device complica-tions.
60Thus, the use of risk factors in decision making
for ICD implantation should occur in the context of thecharacteristics of that individual patient.
A suggested algorithm for ICD implantation is
shown in Figure 3 . There is general agreement that
secondary prevention ICDs are indicated in patients with
HCM.
3It is reasonable to implant a primary prevention
ICD in patients with a family history of SCD, LV wallthickness /C2130 mm, or unexplained syncope. In patients
with only NSVT or an abnormal BP response with ex-ercise, an ICD can be useful if a possible risk marker forSCD (eg, LGE on CMR) is also present.40 Hypertrophic CardiomyopathyAtrial Fibrillation
AF in patients with HCM occurs frequently, is poorly
tolerated, and is associated with an increased risk forthromboembolism, heart failure, and death. Thus, pa-tients with HCM often require an aggressive approach tomaintaining sinus rhythm. Rate control should beattempted initially, but this often requires high doses of
b-blockers or non-dihydropyridine CCBs and is often
inadequate.3Although there is insufficient evidence to
recommend one antiarrhythmic over another, amiodar-one or disopyramide may be the most effective in main-taining sinus rhythm in patients with HCM.
14Sotalol,
dofetilide, and dronedarone may be considered alterna-tive agents.
3If antiarrhythmic therapy is unsuccessful,

tricular out ﬂow; SCD, sudden cardiac death.Annals of Global Health 41pulmonary vein isolation or AV node ablation with
pacemaker implantation should be considered. Surgical
maze also may be considered.
Because of the increased risk for thromboembolism,
anticoagulation is indicated in all patients with HCM withparoxysmal, persistent, or chronic AF regardless ofCHADS2 status.
3Because even brief episodes of AF have
been associated with stroke, there should be a lowthreshold for initiating anticoagulation in these patients.
81
Historically, warfarin has been used in this population,and there are currently no published data on the use ofthe novel anticoagulants in patients with HCM.
Asymptomatic Patients and Screening
of Family Members
Asymptomatic patients. The majority of patients
with HCM will be asymptomatic even in the presence of
LVOT obstruction. The effectiveness of b-blockers and
CCBs is not established in this setting, and routine usein not recommended. Although some therapies such asangiotensin receptor blockers have been shown toreverse or prevent the development of hypertrophy inanimal studies, these have not been demonstrated inhumans.
82Cardiac comorbidities should be treated, and
low-level aerobic exercise is permissible.
Screening family members. The offspring of in-
dividuals with HCM have a 50% chance of inheriting themutation. Because of this, screening of first-degree relativesis of paramount importance. Clinical screening shouldinclude a history and physical examination, 12-lead elec-
trocardiogram, and echocardiography or CMR. SubstantialLV remodeling with the appearance of LVH is usuallyassociated with accelerated b ody growth during puberty with
transformation complete by young adulthood.
63However,
some gene mutations are associated with late onset HCMin mid-life and beyond.
6Because of this, clinical screening
no longer ceases in young adulthood. Table 2 summarizes
the clinical screening intervals by group.
Genetic testing. Eleven or more genes with >1000
mutations have been discovered in association with
HCM.1,83Mutations in b-myosin heavy chain and car-
diac myosin binding protein C account for more than50% of HCM mutations.
84Genetic testing is most useful
in family screening. Current guidelines recommend ge-netic counseling as part of the assessment of patientswith HCM and state that genetic testing in the indexpatient is reasonable to facilitate family screening.
3If a
patient has a gene mutation, then family members can be
screened for that mutation. If the mutation is not pre-
sent, they do not require further testing.
Screening may identify people with a HCM gene
mutation but without evidence of LVH. These “genotype-
positive, phenotype-negative ”patients should undergo
clinical screening as outlined in Table 2 . There is
currently little evidence regarding screening intervals, useof ICDs, and recommendations for participation in
competitive sports. Further studies are required to delin-eate the best management strategies for this emerginggroup of patients.
CONCLUSION
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a complex, genetic dis-ease with heterogeneous phenotypes and clinical mani-festations. The management of any patient with HCMinvolves: 1) the control of heart failure symptoms, 2)assessment of risk for sudden death, 3) the treatment ofAF and reduction of risk for thromboembolism, and 4)
screening of family members. Because of the consider-
able heterogeneity of this disease and lack of randomizeddata, guidelines for patients with HCM simply provide aframework in which to evaluate and treat an individualpatient. Indeed, the unique characteristics and prefer-ences of each individual patient with HCM should play avital role in decision-making and management strategies.Table 2.

8542 Hypertrophic CardiomyopathyFurther studies are needed to improve the care in
this patient population. Long-term data on alcohol septal
ablation will define its precise role in relation to myec-tomy in the management of medically refractory patientswith HCM. Improvements in risk stratification for SCDwill more accurately identify patients with HCM at riskfor SCD, and the development of subcutaneous andleadless ICD systems will likely reduce complicationsand lower the threshold for device implantation in young
patients. The role of genetic testing will also become
clearer when genotyping becomes cheaper and moreaccessible. Finally, ongoing research may identify agentsthat delay the onset of disease in genotype-positive,phenotype-negative patients or prevent disease progres-sion in asymptomatic patients.
