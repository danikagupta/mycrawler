GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
LIGNIN BIODEGRADATION BY WHITE-ROT FUNGI 
The major structural elements of woody tissue are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. 
Wood and other vascular tissues contain generally 20-30% lignin. Lignin gives the plant 
strength, it serves as a barrier against microbial attack and it acts as a water 
impermeable seal across cell walls of the xylem tissue. The compound originates from 
a random polymerization reaction of p-coumaryl alcohol radicals and their methoxy 
substituted counterparts (Dean and Eriksson 1992). These aspecific reactions create 
a high molecular weight, heterogenous, three-dimensional, optical inactive molecule 
containing both ether and carbon-carbon linkages. This structure imposes unusual 
restrictions on biodegradative systems responsible for the initial attack. The systems 
must be extracellular and non-specific. Lignin, the most abundant aromatic polymer 
on earth, is not degraded by hydrolytic enzymes in contrast to cellulose and 
hemicellulose. The most rapid and extensive degradation of lignin described to date 
is caused by the white-rot fungi (Kirk and Farrell 1987, Buswell 1992). Under 
ligninolytic conditions these fungi produce several extracellular enzymes (peroxidases 
and oxidases) and secondary metabolites. Despite the fact that native lignin is 
potentially capable of providing enough energy to sustain fungal growth, white-rot fungi 
can not use lignin as sole source of carbon and energy. Thus, an easily metabolizable 
cosubstrate such as cellulose or hemicellulose, must be available. Most white-rot fungi 
degrade lignin in a secondary metabolic (idiophasic) process, which starts only after 
nitrogen, carbon or sulphur are limiting. For a few fungi, e.g. Lentinula edodes 
(shiitake) and Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) , nitrogen limitation is not a Chapter 1 
prerequisite for lignin degradation. Presently, it is unclear whether such fungi exhibit 
a clear separation between primary and secondary metabolism or if lignin 
biodegradation is regulated differently in these organisms (Kirk and Farrell 1987). Other 
physiological parameters that in general stimulate lignin biodegradation are a high 
oxygen tension, static culture conditions and a pH between 3.5 and 5.5 (Kirk and 
Farrell 1987, Buswell 1992). The fact that the initial degradation of lignin, catalyzed by 
the extracellular enzymes, is non-specific and results in a potpourri of random 
reactions made Kirk and Farrell (1987) describe this process as "enzymatic 
combustion". This unique enzyme system, capable of degrading lignin, gives white-rot 
fungi several distinct advantages for biotechnological purposes above other microbes. 
Several potential applications have been suggested for white-rot fungi, the most 
important ones will be discussed. 
POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF WHITE-ROT FUNGI 
Biopulping of wood. Production of high quality pulps in high yields with a selective 
removal of the lignin moiety, and without substantial destruction of the cellulose and 
hemicellulose, is a major goal. At present two main processes are used to 
manufacture such paper pulps. In the kraft process the wood chips are cooked at high 
temperature in an alkaline environment while in the sulfite process the addition of 
sodium sulfite is used. Both processes use immense amounts of energy, huge 
quantities of chemicals which are not always regenerable, and create vast amounts of 
toxic effluents. Also in the production of thermomechanical pulps substantial amounts 
of energy are required. The use of white-rot fungi or their enzymes offer many potential 
advantages in reducing the above mentioned drawbacks of the current processes 
(Boominathan and Reddy 1992). The main disadvantages of the fungal process are 
the facts that the biological delignification step is too slow and not selective enough 
to compete with conventional pulping methods. 
Recently, promising biomechanical pulping results have been obtained with the 
white-rot fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora. Fungal pretreatment of both soft- and 
hardwood chips resulted in energy savings of approximately 40% and in a 
considerable increase in both tear-strength and burst index compared to untreated 
controls. The fungal treatment causes only slight weight losses (5%) and a limited 
decrease of optical properties. The process has been patented and current research 
focuses on the physico-chemical basis of this biopulping efficiency, the decrease of 
the fungal incubation time and how the process can be scaled up economically 
(Blanchette et al. 1992, Aktar et al. 1992, Aktar et al. 1993). 
10 General introduction 
Biobleaching of paper pulp. The kraft pulping process leaves approximately 10% of 
the lignin in the pulp. Chlorination followed by alkaline extraction is a very efficient way 
to degrade the remaining lignin, but an important drawback is the production of a 
waste water containing toxic chloroaromatics. Several laboratories have focused on 
replacing the chlorination step by biological bleaching with white-rot fungi 
(Boominathan and Reddy 1992, Kantelinen et al. 1993, Onysko 1993). Trametes 
versicolor can biobleach kraft pulp in the absence of physical hyphal-fibre contact and 
with no loss of paper strength properties (Kirkpatrick et al. 1990, Archibald 1992). This 
indicates that time needed for biobleaching can be substantially reduced by using 
'concentrated' extracellular fluid instead of the whole fungus (Archibald 1992). 
However, this process still awaits commercialization. Rather unexpected was the use 
of xylanases to improve the biobleachability of kraft pulps. These enzymes have now 
successfully been used both in the laboratory and on an industrial scale (Viikari et al. 
1992). Recently, xylanases have been tested that are active at pH 9 at 65 °C for two 
hours (Hogman et al. 1992). Future research should be directed to preparations of 
cellulase-free xylanases with better specificities that are active in the high alkalinity and 
temperature of kraft cooking. 
Waste water treatments. The dark coloured waste waters of the pulp and paper 
industries contain high molecular weight, modified and often chlorinated lignins. 
Conventional aerated waste water treatments reduce the biological and chemical 
oxygen demands but are not very effective in removing colour and high molecular 
weight chlorolignins (Boominathan and Reddy 1992). Both colour and chloroaromatics 
concentration are readily removed by several white-rot fungi, including Phlebia radiata 
(Lankinen et al. 1991), Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Fukui et al. 1992) and Trametes 
versicolor (Roy-Arcand and Archibald 1991, Bourbonnais and Paice 1992). The 
MYCOPOR (mycelial colour removal) process, using Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
and a continuous trickling filter system, eliminates both colour and chlorolignins 
efficiently, and is now to run at a pilot plant scale at an Australian pulp mill (Jaklin-
Farcher et al. 1992). Surprisingly, Bergbauer and Eggert (1992) recently reported that 
chlorine-free bleaching effluent had a higher toxicity and was more difficult to degrade 
by T. versicolor and P. chrysosporium than two chlorinated effluents. These results 
demonstrate that a simple replacement of chlorine bleaching with other methods does 
not really solve the problem of the toxic and recalcitrant waste waters of the pulp and 
paper industries. 
11 Chapter 1 
Improved digestibility of lignocellulosic materials. White-rot fungi can potentially 
be used to improve the digestibility of lignocellulosic materials (Hatakka et al. 1989). 
Lignification limits the rumen digestibility of polysaccharides and even a partial 
delignification can give major increases in animal productivity (Reid 1989). In the rain 
forests of southern Chile this process occurs spontaneously resulting in white 
decomposed wood. This ecosystem is called "Palo podrido" and it is characterized by 
a selective degradation of lignin by fungi, such as Ganoderma and Armillaria spp., and 
bacteria. The cellulose is conserved and can be used as feed for cattle (Rfos and 
Eyzaguirre 1992, Bechtold et al. 1993). Lignocellulosic materials can also be used to 
produce fungal food protein (Leonowicz et al. 1991). The benefits of both processes 
can be combined. Several white-rot fungi (e.g. Lentinula edodes, shiitake and 
Pleurotus ostreatus, oyster mushroom) produce highly appreciated, edible fruiting 
bodies, while in the same time the digestibility of the lignocellulosic growth substrate 
is increased (Rajarathnam et al. 1987, Moyson and Verachtert 1991). The feasibility of 
the process can be increased by combining the improved digestibility or production 
of edible fruiting bodies with the extraction of ligninolytic enzymes (Hatakka et al. 1990, 
Mishra et al. 1990). The potential uses of white-rot fungi to improve nutritional quality 
of crops residues are hampered because the results are both very fungal species- and 
crop-specific (Zadrazil 1985, Jung et al. 1992). The major challenge is now to adapt 
and design simple, inexpensive equipment for the upgrading of lignocellulosic materials 
and to test the process in actual operation on the farm. 
Fungal production of renewable raw materials from lignocellulose. The uncertain 
future petroleum supplies have focused the attention on alternative raw materials as 
petroleum substituents, particulary for carbon-based chemicals. Wood is composed 
of 70-80% polymeric carbohydrates and 20-30% of lignin. Carbohydrates occur in 
close association with lignin in the plant cell walls and are only partly available for 
hydrolysis with microbial enzymes. Lignocellulosic materials treated by white-rot fungi 
are better substrates for this enzymic saccharification. White-rot fungi can also 
potentially be used for the production of monomeric aromatic compounds and for the 
solubilization of coal and related substances to chemicals and fuels (Boominatan and 
Reddy 1992). All this research is still in a very preliminary stadium and much needs to 
be done before white-rot fungi are employed in biotechnological processes to produce 
sugars and chemicals. 
Degradation of xenobiotic compounds. The random and non-specific nature of the 
lignin-degrading system also attacks other compounds containing an aromatic 
structure, such as many xenobiotic compounds. It has been shown that the lignin-
12 General introduction 
degrading system of white-rot fungi is involved in the initial oxidation of a wide range 
of pollutants including azo dyes, chlorophenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAH) and dioxins (Aust 1990, Field et al. 1993). The fact that the ligninolytic system 
is active extracellularly makes white-rot fungi far better candidates for the 
bioremediation of soil containing highly apolar pollutants compared with non-ligninolytic 
microorganisms. Non-ligninolytic organisms use intracellular processes to degrade the 
aromatic pollutants, so the limited bioavailability (dissolution and diffusion) is a key 
factor in their slow biodegradation rate (Volkering et al. 1992). Xenobiotics bound to 
humic compounds are mineralized by Phanerochaete chrysosporium at about the 
same rate as the organic carbon from the humic compounds, again demonstrating the 
aselective nature of the ligninolytic system (Haider and Martin 1988). The first 
promising results of using white-rot fungi for in situ bioremediation of contaminated 
soils and wood have appeared (Lamar and Dietrich 1990, Lamar and Dietrich 1992, 
Morgan et al. 1993). 
Azo dyes are the largest class of commercially produced dyes and are used for 
dyeing and printing of natural and synthetic fibres, leather, furs and paper. The 
compounds often have mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic potential, also to men. 
About 10-15% of the dye is lost in the effluent of textile mills and of dye-stuff factories 
and the commonly used waste water treatments do not remove these dyes sufficiently. 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium was able to oxidize and mineralize many sulfonated and 
otherwise substituted azo dyes at a high rate (Pasti-Grigsby et al. 1992, Spadaro et al. 
1992, Paszczynski et al. 1992). These results show that in addition to waste waters of 
the pulp and paper industry white-rot fungi can also be used for the clean-up of dye 
industry effluents. 
Biosynthesis of flavours. At the moment a great interest exists in aromas of 
biological origin, because consumers prefer such compounds over synthetic aromas. 
The production of flavours, e.g. terpenes, lactones and aromatics, is ubiquitous among 
micro-organisms, especially fungi (Janssens et al. 1992). Also several white-rot fungi 
produce odorous components (Gallois et al. 1990, Janssens et al. 1992). Especially 
the production of aromatic compounds is noteworthy. In chapter 2 the important roles 
of the de novo biosynthesized aryl alcohols in the physiology of white-rot fungi will be 
discussed. Several fungal strains with a high flavour production have been described. 
Bjerkandera adusta biosynthesizes veratryl alcohol, a compound with a milky, vanilla 
pungent odour assessment (Berger et al. 1986). Benzyl alcohol is produced by Phlebia 
radiata and has initially a roasted but later a harsh smell (Gross et al. 1989). The main 
components of the smell of Ischnoderma benzoinum are benzaldehyde (almond 
odour) and anisaldehyde (anise-like odour) (Berger et al. 1987). Veratraldehyde has 
13 Chapter 1 
a milky, chocolate aroma and is produced by Dichomitus squalens (Gallois et al. 
1990). The production of flavours by white-rot fungi has considerable potential (Gallois 
et al. 1990). The yields are very much dependent on the growth conditions, and are 
likely to be improved in future. 
OUTLINE OF THIS THESIS 
The lignin biodegradation research at the Wageningen Agricultural University has been 
initiated in 1987 at the Division of Forest Techniques and Wood Science, Department 
of Forestry to investigate the possibilities of white-rot fungi and/or their extracellular 
ligninolytic enzymes for the biopulping of wood. The research was continued in a joint 
program with the ATO, Agrotechnological Research Institute in Wageningen and 
financed by the Dutch government to investigate the potential of hemp (Cannabis 
sativa) as source for paper pulp production. The fundamental aspects of lignin 
biodegradation and the interactions between fungi and aryl alcohols presented in this 
thesis have been studied at the Division of Industrial Microbiology in cooperation with 
forementioned groups and with others. 
Only a few fungal species that cause white-rot have been thoroughly 
characterized. Thus it was decided to start the research by isolating and characterizing 
new strains having better properties than the then known strains. The isolation and 
screening for fungi with a high peroxidative activity is described in chapter 3. One of 
the newly isolated and most active strains, Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, isolated by F.P. 
de Vries at the ATO, was studied in more detail. In addition to lignin peroxidase and 
manganese peroxidase, this organism produced a third extracellular enzyme, 
manganese independent peroxidase (chapter 4). The strain also produced a wide 
range of secondary metabolites. In addition to veratryl alcohol, (chlorinated) anisyl 
alcohols and their corresponding aldehydes were produced (chapter 5). The 
chlorinated anisyl alcohols have an important physiological role as substrates for aryl 
alcohol oxidase, generating extracellular H202forthe peroxidases (chapter 6). Chapter 
7 describes the production of chlorinated aromatics by Bjerkandera spp. in the natural 
environment. Astonishing high concentrations of the chlorinated aromatics were 
produced in the environment by many other common wood and forest-litter degrading 
fungi. 
The production of physiological important secondary metabolites by white-rot 
fungi and their subsequent metabolization have been dealt with more extensively. 
Especially, the important functions of aryl alcohols in the physiology of white-rot fungi 
have been addressed (chapter 2). Secondary metabolites are not only produced but 
14 General introduction 
are also readily metabolized by fungi. Penicillium simplicissimum, not a white-rot 
fungus, was studied since it used veratryl alcohol as sole source of carbon and energy 
(chapter 8). This organism also produces a very interesting intracellular vanillyl alcohol 
oxidase. This enzyme has characteristics completely different from the extracellular aryl 
alcohol oxidases of white-rot fungi, although both enzymes are FAD-dependent 
flavoproteins (chapter 9). Finally, in chapter 10 concluding remarks are made on the 
ligninolytic system of white-rot fungi, the potential of these fungi for biotechnological 
applications and the implications of chlorinated aromatic compounds produced in 
natural environments.

ARYL ALCOHOLS IN THE PHYSIOLOGY 
OF LIGNINOLYTIC FUNGI

SUMMARY 
White-rot fungi have a versatile machinery of enzymes which work in harmony with 
secondary aryl alcohol metabolites to degrade the recalcitrant, aromatic biopolymer 
lignin. This review will focus on the important physiological roles of aryl (veratryl, anisyl 
and chlorinated anisyl) alcohols in the ligninolytic enzyme system. Their functions 
include stabilization of lignin peroxidase, charge-transfer reactions and as substrate for 
oxidases generating extracellular H202. The aryl alcohol / aldehyde couple is well 
protected against degradation by the fungi's extracellular ligninolytic enzymes and their 
concentration in the extracellular fluid is highly regulated by intracellular enzymes.

INTRODUCTION 
Lignin, the most abundant aromatic polymer on earth, is found in all higher plants. The 
compound gives the plant strength, it serves as a barrier against microbial attack and 
it acts as a water impermeable seal across the cell walls in the xylem tissue [1]. The 
biosynthesis of lignin arises from a phenol oxidase catalyzed coupling reaction of p-
coumaryl alcohol and it's methoxy substituted counterparts (Figure 1). The structural 
features of this heterogenous polymer impose unusual restrictions on its 
biodegradability. The initial attack must be extracellular, nonspecific and nonhydrolytic.

of lignin are shown at the lower right. One electron oxidation of the precursors and subsequent 
polymerization reactions produces lignin. 
White-rot fungi, belonging to the basidiomycetes, are responsible for the fastest and 
most extensive degradation of lignin [3]. The white-rot fungus Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium (anamorph: Sporotrichum pulverulentum) has been used extensively 
as a model organism to study the physiological requirements and enzymes required 
for lignin biodegradation. Lignin cannot be degraded as a sole source of carbon and 
energy, consequently lignin degradation only occurs when other readily available 
cosubstrates (e.g. hemicellulose, cellulose) are available. Many environmental factors 
23 Chapter 2 
are known to influence the degradation rate of lignin by this fungus including oxygen 
tension, culture agitation, choice of buffer, mineral concentrations (especially Ca and 
Mn). Lignin degradation by P. chrysosporium occurs during secondary (idiophasic) 
metabolism, triggered by carbon, nitrogen or sulfur limitation [3-5]. The extracellular 
ligninolytic system of P. chrysosporium consists of lignin peroxidase (UP) [6,7], 
manganese peroxidase (MnP) [8], H202-producing enzymes including glyoxal oxidase 
(GLYOX) [9]) and the secondary metabolite veratryl alcohol synthesized de novo [10] 
(Figure 2).

Kerstenetal. [11]). 
Research on lignin biodegradation has accelerated tremendously during the last 15 
years in response to potential applications in several areas. The use of white-rot fungi 
for biopulping and bleaching has been investigated [12,13]. Also the potential of white-
rot fungi and their enzymes to improve the digestibility of lignocellulosic feed has been 
studied [14,15]. Lignin degradation functions in a non-specific manner, consequently 
other compounds that have an aromatic structure are also highly susceptible for attack 
by white-rot fungi and their ligninolytic enzymes. Therefore white-rot fungi can 
potentially be applied to clean-up toxic waste sites [16-18]. 
In recent years several reviews have appeared dealing with lignin 
biodegradation in general [3,4,19] and selected aspects, including the mechanism of 
lignin model compound degradation [20,21], production of lignin peroxidase [6], 
genetic aspects of ligninolytic enzymes [22], ultrastructural localization of lignin 
24 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
degradation and enzymes [23,24] and biotechnological applications [25]. 
An intriguing aspect of the ligninolytic complex of white-rot fungi is the de novo 
biosynthesis of aromatic metabolites, including veratryl, anisyl and chlorinated anisyl 
alcohols. The most enigmatic attribute of these secondary metabolites is their purpose. 
Fungi frequently expend a considerable amount of their available energy to 
biosynthesize these compounds, yet the selective advantage(s) for doing so are not 
obvious [26]. Moreover, it seems contradictory for white-rot fungi to biosynthesize 
aromatic compounds like veratryl alcohol when simultaneously huge amounts of 
analogous aromatic metabolites are formed from lignin biodegradation [27-29]. The 
objectives of this paper are to give an overview of the aryl alcohol metabolite 
biosynthesis and their physiological functions in the ligninolytic complex of white-rot 
fungi. In addition, we will evaluate which enzymes ligninolytic fungi possess to regulate 
the amount of monomeric aromatic metabolites in their extracellular environment. 
BIOSYNTHETIC ROUTES FOR SUBSTITUTED ARYL ALCOHOLS 
Both brown- and white-rot fungi synthesize a wide range of aromatic compounds with 
a methoxygroup at the para-position (Table 1). It is anticipated that these kind of 
compounds are produced via the shikimate pathway [52], However, in most cases 
neither intermediates nor enzymes have been characterized nor have labelling studies 
been performed to confirm that the shikimate pathway is involved. Several white-rot 
fungi produce de novo veratryl alcohol (Table 1). P. chrysosporium biosynthesizes this 
compound via /.-phenylalanine, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamyl alcohol and veratrylglycerol 
(Figure 3) [53]. The enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase is common among 
basidiomycetous fungi [54,55]. Its action results in the recycling of nitrogen, often the 
growth limiting nutrient [3,56]. What enzymes are involved in the hydroxylation 
reactions is not known. Also the final steps in the biosynthesis, the oxidation of 3,4-
dimethoxycinnamyl alcohol to veratrylglycerol and the subsequent Ca-C/3 bond 
cleavage yielding veratraldehyde and glycolaldehyde, are not well characterized. 
Another white-rot fungus, T. versicolor also metabolized added 3,4-dimethoxycinnamyl 
alcohol via veratrylglycerol and veratraldehyde [57]. In vitro these conversions are 
catalyzed by lignin peroxidase [56]. However, the addition of catalase to idiophasic 
cultures of P. chrysosporium did not halt veratryl alcohol biosynthesis [58], and a lignin 
peroxidase negative mutant was still capable of converting exogenous 3,4-
dimethoxycinnamate to veratryl alcohol [56]. This suggests that lignin peroxidase is not 
needed in the biosynthesis route.

Nigroporus durus (syn. Polyporus durus) and Tyromyces sambuceus 
[30,33,49,50,51]. The structure of the secondary metabolites is shown in Fig.

and 3,5-dichloro-anisyl alcohol (o) and aldehyde (•) by fungi. 
Many white-rot fungi also produce anisyl alcohol and aldehyde as well as their 
chlorinated derivatives (Table 1). However, the route by which they are biosynthesized 
by basidiomycetes is not known and should be elucidated by further research. 
The production of secondary metabolites is very much dependent on the strain, 
the growth substrate and the growth conditions [30]. Consequently, the absence of 
a certain secondary metabolite under any given culture condition does not exclude its 
production by the fungus under other conditions. 
Methylation of phenolic metabolites. Many secondary metabolites contain methoxy 
groups (Table 1), indicating the presence of a methylating system in white-rot fungi. 
Methylation is also a common reaction in the catabolism of aromatic compounds by 
white-rot fungi. When grown on lignocellulose as substrate, lignin degradation 
metabolites, including vanillate [27,29] and syringate [59], are methylated. Subsequent 
reduction of veratrate contributes significantly to the veratryl alcohol titer (Figure 3), 
parallel to de novo biosynthesis [29]. It has been suggested that methylation of 
phenolic compounds prevents polymerization reactions by phenol oxidases and 
detoxifies the culture broth. Recently, a S-adenosyl methionine-dependent O-
methyltransferase was purified from the white-rot fungus P. chrysosporium and 
characterized. This enzyme catalyzed the para-specific methylation of vanillate and 
syringate [60]. The enzyme has no activity with ferulate, isoferulate or caffeate, 
suggesting that it is not involved in the proposed biosynthesis route of veratryl alcohol 
(Figure 3) [53]. 
The brown-rot fungi Lentinus lepideus [56,61,62] and Piptoporus betulinus (syn. 
27 Chapter 2 
Polyporus betulinus) [30] only produce methylated aromatic acids e.g. methyl anisate. 
Methyl p-methoxycinnamate was produced when the brown-rot fungus L. lepideus was 
incubated with methyl p-coumarate and [14CH3]-methionine. The [14CH3]-methionine 
lable was found both in the methyl and in the methoxy group [61]. From this organism 
two distinct S-adenosyl methionine-dependent O-methyltransferases were partly 
purified, one catalyzing the formation of methyl esters from free aromatic acids while 
the other catalyzes the para-specific methylation of these methyl esters [63,64].

Figure 3. The secondary metabolite veratryl alcohol originates from de novo biosynthesis via 
phenylalanine, veratrylglycerol and veratraldehyde or from the lignin biodegradation intermediate 
vanillate, via methylation and subsequent reduction, (adapted from [29,53]). 
Another methyl donor used by basidiomycetes in the biosynthesis of methoxy groups 
and esters is chloromethane (CH3CI) which has a primary role in the methylation of 
aromatic compounds, such as acids or phenols [65]. Hymenochaetaceae, a widely 
distributed family of wood-rotting bracket fungi (including Phellinus spp.) release 
significant amounts of chloromethane (CH3CI) in the environment [66,67]. Also several 
edible mushrooms from the orders of Boletales and Agaricales (Boletus edulis and 
Agaricus bisporus) produce CH3CI [68]. The methyl group of chloromethane is also 
derived through a S-adenosyl methionine transferase [69]. At least two distinct 
chloromethane-utilizing systems occur in Phellinus pomaceus. One system is involved 
in methylating the carboxylic acids and the other system methylates the phenolic 
groups [65]. Harper and colleagues [43] showed that CH3CI could serve as a methyl 
donor in the biosynthesis of veratryl alcohol. Fungi belonging to families of Coriolaceae 
28 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
and Polyporaceae (P. chrysosporium, T. versicolor and P. radiata) do not emit 
detectable amounts of CH3CI, but when they are grown in the presence of C2H3CI high 
levels of C2H3 were incorporated both in the 3- and 4-O-methyl groups of veratryl 
alcohol. However, the addition of CH3CI to cultures of P. chrysosporium did not result 
in increased levels of veratryl alcohol [70]. In P. chrysosporium two distinct systems 
are simultaneously involved in methylating reactions, one using S-adenosyl methionine 
as methyl donor and the other using CH3CI as methyl donor [71]. The results show 
that CH3CI is a common intermediate in methylating systems of basidiomycetous fungi, 
although it is not always produced in detectable amounts. Future research should 
focus on the characterization of this unknown enzyme system responsible for the 
methyl transfering reactions from chloromethane to aromatic compounds. Besides 
methylation also xylosylation reactions are possible with the hydroxy groups. 
Xylosylation of veratryl and vanillyl alcohol. The white-rot fungus T. versicolor 
xylosylates both secondary metabolites and lignin biodegradation intermediates. Kondo 
et al. [72] showed that veratryl and vanillyl alcohol are glycosylated (Figure 4). The 
phenolic hydroxyl group is much more extensively glycosylated than the alcoholic 
hydroxyl group. Several roles have been suggested for these glycosylation reactions 
in lignin biodegradation. The prevention of polymerization reactions by phenol 
oxidases, the conversion of oligomeric lignin molecules to more hydrophilic 
compounds and the detoxification of phenolic compounds are possible explanations. 
A possible example of the latter role is the xylosylation of 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol by T. 
versicolor [73], but all possible roles need further confirmation.

Chlorination of aromatic compounds. The fact that basidiomycetes can produce 
chlorinated compounds has been known for some time [74-76]. It is anticipated that 
haloperoxidases are involved in most biohalogenation reactions [75]. From terrestrial 
fungi two different classes of extracellular chloroperoxidases have been described. 
Caldariomyces fumago produces a heme-containing chloroperoxidase [77], while a 
dematiaceous hyphomycete, Curvularia inaequalis, produces an vanadium-dependent 
chloroperoxidase [78]. The sources and properties of both heme- and vanadium-
containing chloroperoxidases have been reviewed recently [77]. The occurrence of 
chloroperoxidases in basidiomycetes has not yet been described. Although lignin 
peroxidase can brominate veratryl alcohol, it is unreactive with chloride [79].

tyrosols (B), p-hydroxypheylacetate (C) and chlorinated anisyl metabolites (CAM) (D and E). 
Table 1 shows that several basidiomycetes also produce chlorinated anisyl alcohols 
and aldehydes. The chlorinated anisyl metabolites (CAM) are produced both under 
laboratory conditions [31,40,80] and in the environment [32]. It is anticipated that 
phenylalanine or tyrosine is also a precursor in the biosynthesis of CAM compounds. 
The production of chlorinated amino acids has been reported for several marine 
organisms. 3-Chlorotyrosine has been isolated (Figure 5) from the welk Buccinum 
undatum [81] and the cuticle of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus [82], the 
latter also produces 3,5-dichlorotyrosine. From cuticular proteins of a terrestrial insect 
(locust, Schistocerca gregaria) 3-chlorotyrosine has also been purified [83]. Also in the 
culture fluids of fungi, chlorinated amino acid derivatives have been found. 
Caldariomyces fumago produced chlorinated tyrosols (Figure 5) [84]. The chlorination 
of tyrosol is catalyzed in vitro by chloroperoxidase. The basidiomycete Marasmius 
palmivorus produced 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate (Figure 5) [52], which is 
perhaps derived from 3-chlorotyrosine via deamination and decarboxylation.

LIGNINOLYTIC ENZYMES OF WHITE-ROT FUNGI 
The preceding paragraph has shown that the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites 
is common among white-rot fungi, thus it is interesting to know if these metabolites 
have a role in the ligninolytic system of those fungi. To answer this question first the 
extracellular ligninolytic enzyme system will be explained. 
Peroxidases, laccases and H202-producing oxidases are important enzymes of 
the extracellular ligninolytic machinery secreted by white-rot fungi. Table 2 summarizes 
the extracellular peroxidases and oxidases described in white-rot fungi. The table 
clearly demonstrate that the ligninolytic enzyme complex is not so homogeneous 
among white-rot fungi as once thought [3]. However, it should be kept in mind that the 
detection of ligninolytic enzymes in the culture broth is often difficult because of the 
association of the enzymes to the fungal mycelium [85] and/or the occurrence of 
inhibitors in the culture broth [86-89]. 
The reactions catalyzed by phenol oxidizing enzymes (laccases and 
peroxidases) are very similar. Laccase and the different peroxidases (including lignin 
peroxidase (UP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)) 
can oxidize phenolic compounds creating phenoxy radicals [20,21,90], while non-
phenolic compounds are oxidized to the corresponding cation radicals. All phenolic 
compounds are oxidized by phenol oxidases, whereas the different enzymes have 
complete dissimilar substrate ranges for non-phenolic compounds. Laccase can only 
oxidize compounds with a relatively low ionization potential, including 1,2,4,5-
tetramethoxybenzene (E1/2 < = 0.81 V versus a saturated calomel electrode), to the 
corresponding cation radical [91-93]. Non-phenolic compounds with higher ionization 
potentials (E1/2 < = 1.06-1.12 V) are still readily oxidized by both UP, MnP, HRP. UP 
is an extraordinary peroxidase since it can oxidize non-phenolic aromatic compounds 
with very high ionization potentials such as 1,2-dimethoxybenzene (E1/2 = 1.5 V) and 
veratryl alcohol [92,94]. The exact oxidizing activity of MnP is at the moment still 
unclear [93,95-97]. 
First it is important to discuss the characteristics of each ligninolytic enzyme. 
With this information, it will be possible to explain the physiological roles and the 
metabolism of the de novo biosynthesized aryl alcohols.

Lignin peroxidase. Lignin peroxidase (LiP, EC 1.11.1.-) is an extracellular lignin 
degrading enzyme discovered in ligninolytic cultures of P. chrysosporium [6,7]. The 
enzyme is produced by many (Table 2) but not by all white-rot fungi. Together with 
other enzymes, LiP is thought to constitute the major component of the lignin 
degrading system of P. chrysosporium. However, with in vitro experiments only 
polymerization reactions of lignin were noticed [131] leading to doubts about the 
essential role of LiP in vivo [132]. Several facts indicate that LiP is important in lignin 
and xenobiotic degradation by LiP-producing white-rot fungi. The enzyme can 
depolymerize dilute solutions of lignin in vitro [133], can oxidize and depolymerize a 
variety of dimers and oligomers structurally related to lignin in vitro [20,21] and LiP 
catalyzes the production of activated oxygen species [134]. Furthermore, the 
observation was made that cultures supplemented with LiP, degrade lignin much faster 
than reference cultures which received no enzyme [135]. It has also been suggested 
that LiP plays a much more important role in the degradation of synthetic 14C-lignin to 
14C02 than MnP [114,119,136]. The reaction mechanisms of lignin model compound 
oxidation have been extensively reviewed [20,21].

The P. chrysosporium enzyme is a monomeric N- and probably O-glycosylated 
protein with four disulfide bonds [137,138]. Its pH-optimum near 3 is unusually low 
[139]. LiP contains one iron protoporphyrin IX as prosthetic group and has the same 
catalytic cylce as horseradish peroxidase (HRP).

veratryl alcohol radical (adapted from [121,149]). 
In Figure 6, the five oxidation states are shown. Reaction 1 of ferric enzyme with H202 
yields the compound I, ferryl iron (Felv) porphyrin cation radical intermediate, which is 
2 oxidizing equivalents above the resting state. One-electron reduction of compound 
I with a reducing substrate (e.g. veratryl alcohol [121,140]) or H202 yields the iron oxo 
intermediate, compound II (reaction 2). This intermediate still contains ferryl iron (Felv) 
but no longer has the porphyrin cation radical. Finally a single one electron reduction 
step returns the enzyme to its native state (reaction 3), completing the catalytic cycle 
[141-143]. In the absence of reducing substrate, compound II is further oxidized by 
H202 to compound III, a species with limited catalytic ability [144-147]. Compound III 
is stable, but it is inactivated rapidly in the presence of excess H202 [148]. Compound 
III can return to the resting ferric state either spontaneously or in the presence of H202 
and a reducing substrate like veratryl alcohol [149]. 
The enzyme is produced as a set of closely related isozymes with molecular 
weights ranging from 38 to 43 kilodaltons, and is encoded by different genes in P. 
34 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
chrysosporium [139,150], P. radiata [121,151], B. adusta [152] and T. versicolor 
[129,153]. The expression of LiP genes is regulated by an inverse function of the Mn" 
concentration [114,154,155]. The Mn" concentration has no influence on the amount 
of veratryl alcohol biosynthesized [156]. Intracellular^, the concentrations of cAMP 
regulate the LiP gene expression at the level of transcription [157]. The influence of 
several culture parameters on the production of LiP by P. chrysosporium has been 
reviewed [5]. Both the strain and the growth conditions alter the balance and the 
nature of the different isozymes [158-160]. 
Manganese Peroxidase. In addition to LiP, white-rot fungi produce extracellular 
manganese peroxidase (MnP, E.C. 1.11.1.-) under ligninolytic conditions (Table 2). The 
enzyme was first discovered in the culture fluid of P. chrysosporium [8]. The 
MnP/Mn"/malonate system oxidizes several phenolic substrates including lignin and 
xenobiotic model compounds [17,161,162]. Furthermore, the Mn'"-chelator complex 
is a freely diffusible oxidant (mediator), and consequently it can oxidize lignin within the 
woody matrix. Purified enzyme can give depolymerization of a synthetic lignin (DHP) 
[163], and also degrades high molecular weight chlorolignins [164]. MnP is the 
predominant enzyme involved in kraft pulp bleaching [89,165] and the decolorization 
of bleach plant effluents [155]. 
MnP is a glycoprotein (M, 46000) and contains one iron protoporphyrin IX 
prosthetic group [166,167]. The enzyme exists as several closely related isozymes and 
are encoded by several different genes in P. chrysosporium [159,168] and T. 
versicolor [129,153]. The expression of MnP genes is regulated by a direct function 
of the Mn" concentration [109,114,154-156,169]. Intracellular^, the concentrations of 
cAMP regulate the MnP gene expression at the level of transcription [157]. Both 
spectral characteristics and the catalytic cycle of MnP are very similar to LiP and 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP, EC 1.11.1.7) [141,170-173]. However, Mn" is required 
for the reduction of compound II back to the native ferric enzyme in order to complete 
the catalytic cycle [170,172]. 
After oxidation by MnP, Mn"' must form a complex with a chelator before it can 
oxidize phenolic substrates [173]. Organic acids are good chelators [166,172,174] and 
basidiomycetes are producers of oxalic acid [134,173,175-177], malonic acid [173], 
pyruvic acid [178] and malic acid [179]. Mn"'/oxalate and Mn'"/malonate form very 
stable complexes, which probably function in vivo. Malonate facilitates Mn'" 
dissociation from the enzyme and has a relatively low Mn" binding constant [173]. The 
Mn'"/malate complex is not stable, decomposition by H202 leads to the formation of 
molecular oxygen and Mn" [180]. 
Other phenol oxidases can behave like MnP under special conditions. LiP is 
35 Chapter 2 
capable of Mn1" generation in the presence of a suitable charge-transfer mediator, e.g. 
veratryl alcohol [181,182]. Laccase and peroxidases from horseradish (HRP), 
Arthromyces ramosus and Coprinus macrorhizus can generate Mn'" ions in the 
presence of a phenol (i.e. m-cresol or 3-hydroxybenzoate), Mn", H202 and 
pyrophosphate [183]. The major difference between MnP and other phenol oxidases 
is the ability of MnP to directly oxidize Mn" to Mn'" in the absence of a (non)-phenolic 
co-substrate. Consequently, all phenol oxidases can potentially perform the same 
mediator reaction as MnP by producing the diffusible Mn'" oxidant. Further research 
is necessary to investigate the role, if any, of this MnP-independent formation of Mn"' 
ions in vivo. 
Other peroxidases. Several reports have appeared where extracellular peroxidative 
activies other than UP or MnP were detected. Bjerkandera adusta [100,104], 
Junghuhnia separabilima [87], Coprinus cinereus [107,108], Inonotus weirrii [113], 
Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Dichomitus squalens [46]) all produce unique 
extracellular peroxidases. These not so well characterized enzymes show no reactivity 
with veratryl alcohol in the standard ligninase assay [184] and are, in terms of the 
reactions catalyzed, comparable with HRP. 
Laccase. Laccases (benzenediokoxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) are multi-
copper containing enzymes catalyzing the four one-electron oxidations of a variety of 
mostly polyhydric phenolic compounds and simultaneous four-electron reduction of 
dioxygen to water [185]. The enzyme is produced by almost all white-rot fungi (Table 
2) [111,186], with P. chrysosporium being a notable exception [3]. Its production is 
dependent on the culture conditions [98,123,187], and both constitutive and inducible 
forms of laccase are known. The inducible forms in general have a higher activity 
[188]. Laccase has been linked many times with lignin degradation [21,189]. This is 
in part because of the widespread production of laccase by white-rot fungi, but also 
because the reactions of laccase with phenolic lignin substructure models are similar 
to the mechanisms reported for lignin peroxidase [21]. However, in in vitro 
experiments using purified enzyme, lignin polymerization reactions predominate. The 
addition of purified laccase also gives a limited demethylation of kraft pulp [165]. It has 
also been speculated that laccase has a role in toxicity reduction of phenolic 
compounds by the polymerization reactions [190]. All laccases are glycoproteins 
[185]. A. bisporus laccase contains equal amounts of O- and A/-linked carbohydrates 
[191]. It has been proposed that the AMinked carbohydrate chains protect T. versicolor 
laccase III from proteolysis [192]. In general laccase contains four copper ions, 
allthough also enzymes with two, three and six copper atoms are known [193]. 
36 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
H202 producing enzymes. The extracellular peroxidases need H202 for activity. 
Interestingly, one of the enzymes that generates H202 is extracellular aryl alcohol 
oxidase (AAO). This enzyme oxidize aromatic alcohols to aldehydes and reduces 02 
to H202 (Figure 7). AAO activity has been found in cultures of T. versicolor [130], 
Pleurotus sajor-caju [126], P. ostreatus [124], P. eryngii [194-196] and B. adusta 
[103,197]. Also extracellular a,/3-unsaturated alcohol oxidase of Fusarium spp. [198] 
and intracellular vanillyl alcohol oxidase of Penicillium simplicissimum [199] have been 
described. These enzymes of the hyphomycetes do not resemble the extracellular 
AAO's of basidiomycetes. It is interesting to note that the intracellular vanillyl alcohol 
oxidase needs a hydroxy group in the para-position [199] while extracellular AAO 
shows reduced or no activity with 4-hydroxy-substituted aryl alcohols [124,195]. AAO 
of P. eryngii is a glycoprotein of 72.6 kDa and contains FAD as a prosthetic group. 
The enzyme has the highest activity with non-phenolic aryl alcohols but also shows 
activity with aliphatic alcohols with a conjugated double bond, its activity is strongly 
increased by an additional conjugated double bond [195].

AAO is not the only system available to white-rot fungi to produce extracellular H202. 
Many other extracellular and intracellular oxidases are known which provide hydrogen 
peroxide. Extracellular glyoxal oxidase [9,200] is thought to be very important for H202 
generation (Table 2). MnP can generate H202 by catalyzing the oxidation of NAD(P)H 
[201] and also extracellular pyranose 2-oxidase has been detected [105,202]. 
Several intracellular enzymes producing H202 have been reported from white-rot 
fungi, including glucose-1-oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4) [203], pyranose-2-oxidase (EC 
1.1.3.10) [204,205], methanol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.13) [206] and fatty acyl-CoA oxidase

SIMULTANEOUS OCCURRENCE OF LIGNINOLYTIC ACTIVITY AND ARYL 
ALCOHOL PRODUCTION 
It is important to know if the secondary metabolites and the ligninolytic enzymes are 
produced concurrently. The production of veratryl alcohol by P. chrysosporium and 
the onset of ligninolysis are closely linked. Both appear at the onset of idiophase 
[208]. Moreover, culture conditions which stimulate lignin degradation, such as an 
elevated oxygen tension [53] and high cAMP levels [209], increase the veratryl alcohol 
titer, whereas factors that decrease lignin degradation, such as culture agitation [53] 
and high levels of glutamate or ammonium nitrogen, also decrease the veratryl alcohol 
titer [209,210]. However, the results obtained with both mutant and revertant strains 
of P. chrysosporium have not unequivocally revealed a linkage between lignin 
decomposition and veratryl alcohol biosynthesis [211-213]. Also Bjerkandera spp. 
produce several secondary metabolites [31,33] simultaneously with their ligninolytic 
enzymes [105]. In this fungus, both the LiP-production and the veratryl alcohol 
biosynthesis are strongly stimulated by N-rich glucose/peptone medium [102,105]. 
Because the ligninolytic enzymes and secondary metabolites are produced 
simultaneously, it is interesting to see what physiological roles aryl alcohols have in the 
ligninolytic system. 
PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLES OF ARYL ALCOHOLS 
Numerous fungi produce de novo aryl alcohols and aldehydes (Table 1) and several 
roles have been suggested for these compounds, particularly veratryl alcohol, in the 
physiology of white-rot fungi: 
1) induction of ligninolytic enzymes by aryl alcohols 
2) stabilization of lignin peroxidase by veratryl alcohol 
3) role of veratryl alcohol as a charge-transfer mediator 
4) veratryl alcohol and the formation of activated oxygen species 
5) aryl alcohols as substrates for H202-producing enzymes 
The different aspects of those physiological roles will be discussed in the following 
chapter. 
38 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
Induction of ligninolytic enzymes by aryl alcohols. The effect of aryl alcohols on 
the induction of the ligninolytic system has been studied by adding these compounds 
to growing cultures. Cultures of P. chrysosporium supplemented with exogenous 
veratryl alcohol demonstrated an earlier appearance of lignin degradation [208] and 
a higher lignin degradation rate [135]. This stimulation of lignin degradation was found 
with many LiP-producing white-rot fungi, including P. radiata [214] and T.versicolor 
[100]. The effect of other aryl alcohols on lignin degradation rates is not known. 
The addition of veratryl alcohol induced LiP production by P. chrysosporium 
[58,215,216] and P. radiata [217]). In T. versicolor on the other hand, veratryl alcohol 
did not increase LiP production [218]. However, a direct correlation between veratryl 
alcohol addition and the increase of LiP mRNA or the translation of LiP proteins has 
yet to be proven [219]. Veratryl alcohol not only induces LiP but may also enhance the 
formation of MnP and laccase in P. radiata [217,220]. It is interesting to note that 
aromatic compounds including veratryl alcohol and veratrate, which themselves are 
not laccase substrates, are able to induce laccase production [122,220-222]. 
Other aryl alcohols, including anisyl and vanillyl alcohol, are in general less 
effective in inducing LiP and MnP production [58,222]. However, addition of anisyl 
alcohol to cultures of the white-rot fungus P. tigrinus stimulated MnP production by 2.5 
fold while veratryl alcohol had no inducing effect [223]. In several fungi laccases are 
induced upon addition of various aromatic compounds, including 2,5-xylidine and 
ferulic acid [122,188,221,222,224,225]. 
Aryl alcohol oxidase appears to be a constitutive enzyme in both Pleurotus spp. 
[195] and B. adusta [102] and is not induced by veratryl alcohol [124]. However, light 
stimulates AAO activity in P. eryngii [196]. 
During lignin biodegradation significant amounts of monomeric aromatic 
compounds are found in the culture fluids [27,29]. However, it should be kept in mind 
that these concentrations (MM range) are considerably lower than used in the 
induction experiments. Consequently, the results of the induction experiments should 
be interpreted with caution. Physiological roles of the aryl alcohols other than induction 
are probably more important in the in vivo situation. 
Stabilization of lignin peroxidase by veratryl alcohol. Purified LiP's are irreversibly 
inactivated in the presence of H202 [145,226,227] and it is suspected that these 
enzymes may also be inactivated by H202 under physiological conditions [228]. 
Consequently, some mechanism must exist to stabilize LiP or they would be of little 
value for the fungus. Haemmerli et al. [229] were the first to propose that veratryl 
alcohol has a stabilizing effect on LiP. Veratryl alcohol can conserve LiP activity by 
closing the catalytic cycle at the level of the reactions 1,2 and 3 in Figure 6. The 
39 Chapter 2 
formation of the rather unstable and catalytically less active compound III would thus 
be avoided. Furthermore, in the presence of H202, veratryl alcohol can convert 
compound III back to the resting ferric state [149] (Figure 6). Inactivation of LiP is 
prevented if the veratryl alcohol/H202 ratio is greater than 200 at a H202 concentration 
of 10 nM [227]. The oxidation of anisyl alcohol, a poor LiP substrate, is Tncreased by 
the addition of veratryl alcohol [230], and this stimulation can be explained by 
prevention of enzyme inactivation [231]. Phenolic compounds, including guaiacol and 
vanillyl alcohol, are as good substrates for LiP as is veratryl alcohol. However, these 
compounds do not have a role in preventing enzyme inactivation [232]. 
Role of veratryl alcohol as charge-transfer mediator. Harvey and others [230,233] 
proposed that veratryl alcohol can act as a charge-transfer mediator in lignin 
degradation. They suggested that veratryl alcohol is oxidized via cation radical 
intermediates, which are known to be powerful charge-transfer reagents [234] that can 
oxidize large hydrophobic molecules like lignin. Simultaneously, the catalytic cycle of 
LiP is closed, thereby preventing the formation of LiP compound III (Figure 6). The 
veratryl alcohol cation radical is reduced to veratryl alcohol and ready for another LiP 
catalyzed charge-transfer reaction. 
The formation of veratryl alcohol radical-cations and their ability to participate 
in charge-transfer reactions has been questioned. Free radical cations derived from 
veratryl alcohol were not detected with ESR techniques [142]. Nevertheless there are 
several indications that the veratryl alcohol cation radical is formed in the LiP-catalyzed 
oxidation of veratryl alcohol. The oxidation of several methoxybenzenes generates ESR 
detectable cation radicals [92,235]. One of the tested compounds, 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene, has a comparable effect as veratryl alcohol in enhancing the 
oxidation of anisyl alcohol and 4-methoxymandelate [230], Furthermore, the production 
of several quinones and lactones in veratryl alcohol oxidation can only be explained 
when radical cations are produced [236-238]. It has been proposed that veratryl 
alcohol can function as charge-transfer mediator between the redox cycles of 
cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase and LiP [239,240]. Also the veratryl alcohol 
mediated formation of active oxygen species point to charge-transfer reactions (Figure 
6, 9 and 10) [134,149,181]. Indeed, with NMR spectroscopy it was shown that radical 
intermediates are produced during LiP-catalyzed veratryl alcohol oxidation [241]. 
The fact that cation radicals are formed does not prove the role of veratryl 
alcohol as charge-transfer mediator in the oxidation of a third compound. Several 
groups have intensively researched the oxidation of anisyl alcohol, 4-
methoxymandelate, lignin model compounds and dyes with LiP or with simple LiP 
mimics (hemin) in the presence and absence of veratryl alcohol [133,231,233,242-245]. 
40 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
Since anisyl alcohol and 4-methoxymandelate have higher redox potentials than 
veratryl alcohol itself, it is unlikely they would be more easily oxidized to cation radicals 
than veratryl alcohol. However, follow-up reactions, like the irreversible decarboxylation 
of 4-methoxymandelate into anisaldehyde, suggests that the occurrence of the 4-
methoxymandelate radical is still a possibility. This hypothesis is supported by the fact 
that laccase decarboxylates 4-hydroxymandelate into stoichiometric amounts of 4-
hydroxybenzaldehyde. The initially formed 4-hydroxymandelate radical is probably not 
stable enough to give polymerization reactions (Figure 8) [246]. 
The results obtained with anisyl alcohol do not fit into the charge-transfer 
hypothesis. At H202-concentrations which are low enough to avoid UP inactivation, UP 
is able to directly catalyse the oxidation of anisyl alcohol in the absence of veratryl 
alcohol [231] and with simple hemin mimics veratryl alcohol even repressed anisyl 
alcohol oxidation [245]. This result suggest that veratryl alcohol functions as a UP 
stabilisator.

Figure 8. Proposed mechanism for veratryl alcohol radical cation as a charge-transfer mediator in the 
oxidation of 4-methoxymandelic acid. The bottom reaction shows the stoichiometric conversion of 4-
hydroxymandelic acid in 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (adapted from [230,233,246]). 
However, during the UP catalyzed oxidation of 4-methoxymandelate, veratryl 
alcohol can act as a charge-transfer mediator (Figure 8). The oxidation of veratryl 
alcohol to veratraldehyde by LiP was completely inhibited by 4-methoxymandelate 
41 Chapter 2 
[233]. Veratraldehyde formation commenced only after depletion of 4-
methoxymandelate, while in the absence of veratryl alcohol no anisaldehyde was 
formed. A similar inhibition of veratryl alcohol oxidation was also seen during the 
oxidation of several azo dyes [244]. Fawer et al. [227] demonstrated with flow injection 
analysis a mediator role for veratryl alcohol. This mediated oxidation of a third 
substrate, e.g. lignin, only functioned when all components were present 
simultaneously, and was not observed when lignin was separated from the site of 
veratryl alcohol oxidation. Consequently, they proposed that an enzyme-bound cation 
radical is the mediating species. The results show that veratryl alcohol both can act 
as a stabilisator of LiP and as a charge-transfer mediator. In experiments it is often 
impossible to distinguish between both functions. 
Veratryl alcohol and the formation of active oxygen species. Before the 
extracellular ligninolytic enzymes of P. chrysosporium were detected, it was speculated 
that activated oxygen species were important in lignin degradation [247-249]. There 
is now unequivocal evidence that H202 plays an important role in lignin degradation 
[4] as a substrate for the peroxidases but H202 itself is not a lignin oxidant [3]. Three 
other activated oxygen species are known to occur in biological systems: superoxide 
radical (02'~), hydroxyl radical (*OH) and singlet oxygen (102). Only *OH and 102 are 
reactive enough to be considered as direct lignin oxidants. Recent research has shown 
that 02"~ and *OH species can be formed in in vitro experiments [134,149,181]. The 
production of 102 by ligninolytic enzymes has not yet been shown. 
The production and consumption of activated oxygen species is a complex matter, 
even in simple model systems. The production of the least reactive species, 02*~ and 
the involvement of veratryl alcohol in each of the four reactions will be discussed first. 
In Scheme 1 the different equations leading to activated oxygen species are 
presented. 
1) The unreactive LiP compound III is formed when no reducing substrate, i.e. 
veratryl alcohol, is present (Figure 6). This compound decays either 
spontaneously or in the presence of veratryl alcohol (VA) and H202 to ferric LiP 
and 02*~ (Scheme 1, eq. 3 and 4) [149]. 
2) During the oxidation of veratryl alcohol (Scheme 1, eq. 1 and Figure 10) and 4-
methoxymandelate by LiP the formation of 02*~ has been suggested 
[181,230,236]. Further reduction of 02'~ (Scheme 1, eq. 10 and 11) generates 
a new H202 molecule. It was found that Mn" strongly stimulates this reduction 
of 02*~ (Scheme 1, eq. 8), increasing the veratraldehyde/H202 ratio significantly 
above 1 [181]. 
42 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
3) In the presence of excess H202, UP catalyzes via veratryl alcohol radical cation 
(VA+*) the one-electron oxidation of H202to produce 02*~ and veratryl alcohol 
(Scheme 1, eq. 2 and Fig 9) [250]. Together with equations 10 and 11, a netto 
production of 02 and a simultanous decrease of H202 will be the result. So, this 
reaction can regulate the extracellular H202 concentration. 
4) Both oxalate and EDTA cause the same non-competitive inhibition of veratryl 
alcohol oxidation by reducing the veratryl alcohol cation radical [182,251-253]. 
In this reaction sequence (Scheme 1, eq. 4 and 5 and Fig 9) 02*" is formed 
[182,251]. Interestingly, EDTA could not inhibit the oxidation of guaiacol and 
coniferyl alcohol [253], so phenoxy radicals are not reduced by EDTA. At very 
low H202 concentrations also a direct oxidation of oxalate in the absence of 
veratryl alcohol was noticed [254].

The other species encountered is *OH. Its production in biological systems is very 
difficult to account for because this compound reacts with almost all biological 
molecules [256]. These radicals may very well be involved in lignin degradation since 
Gierer et al. [257] showed that "OH can react with both phenolic and non-phenolic 
lignin model compounds. The most important reactions included oxidative coupling, 
demethoxylation, hydroxylation and oxidation of methyl groups. The so-called Fenton 
reaction (Eq. 8) can generate 'OH, although there is controversy if this reaction occurs 
under physiological conditions. However, Barr and others [134] have recently shown 
that in in vitro experiments carried out under physiological conditions (pH 5) reactions 
5, 6, 7 and 9 leading to "OH formation can take place (Figure 9). P. chrysosporium 
and several brown-rot fungi give chemiluminescence in in vivo experiments, indicating

We can conclude that LiP can also catalyze several reductive reactions resulting 
in the formation of 02"" (Eq. 1,2,3,6) and 'OH (Eq. 9) species. In several cases 
veratryl alcohol acts as a charge-transfer mediator. These results show that activated 
oxygen species can be generated. Future research should elucidate if these species 
are formed just by minor side reactions of trivial significance or are indeed important 
in in vivo lignin and xenobiotic degradation.

The production of H202with aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO). Veratryl alcohol is a good 
substrate for LiP and acts as a stabilisator and charge-transfer mediator. The other 
common secondary metabolites (Table 1), i.e anisyl, 3-chloro-anisyl and 3,5-dichloro-
anisyl alcohol, are not readily oxidized by LiP or other peroxidases [5,105,231] and 
have apparently another physiological role in the ligninolytic system. All these alcohols 
are good substrates for extracellular AAO, an enzyme produced by several white-rot 
fungi (Table 2). Thus, all the aryl alcohols can be used for extracellular H202-
generation. 
The oxidases of P. sajor-caju, P. ostreatus and P. eryngii are very similar 
regarding substrate specifity and affinity for veratryl and anisyl alcohol [124,126,195]. 
The enzyme has a ten times higher affinity for the latter compound [201]. P. ostreatus 
does not produce significant amounts of veratryl alcohol, however when grown on 
either synthetic glucose medium or in fungal associated wood samples [32] 
anisaldehyde could be detected (unpublished results), indicating an active AAO 
coupled H202-generating system. 
Recently, we have discovered that many wood or forest-litter degrading 
basidtomycetes produce chlorinated anisyl metabolites (CAM) [32]. Most strains 
44 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
decolorize Poly R-478, an indicator for ligninolytic activity [101,260,261] and had AAO 
activity. It was shown that AAO of Bjerkandera BOS55 has a much higher affinity for 
the chlorinated anisyl compounds compared to the non-chlorinated counterparts, 
anisyl and veratryl alcohol [105]. Another possible advantage of the Cl-groups is the 
fact that the compounds are not substrates for UP [105]. The induction of LiP by 
glucose/peptone medium [102] was correlated with an increased production of 
veratryl alcohol and not with an increased production of the other aryl alcohols [105]. 
These results show that some white-rot fungi produce chlorinated aromatic 
compounds which have an important function in the extracellular H202 production 
besides having a possible antibiotic activity [80]. The main function of veratryl alcohol 
in the ligninolytic system are stabilization and charge-transfer reactions of LiP. 
MAINTENANCE OF THE CATALYTIC CYCLE, THE REDUCTION OF ARYL 
ALDEHYDES 
If the aryl alcohols have a truly physiological important role, then the oxidized 
metabolites must be recycled. These aryl aldehydes, veratraldehyde and (chlorinated) 
anisaldehydes, must be reduced to again produce the alcohols with their metabolic 
function as LiP and AAO substrates. It is not permissible to utilize energy for supplying 
each catalytic cycle with newly biosynthesized aryl alcohols. Already in 1959, Farmer 
et al. [262] found aromatic acid and aromatic aldehyde reducing activity in Trametes 
(syn. Polystictus) versicolor. The crude, NAD(P)H-dependent enzyme(s) are active on 
several aromatic compounds including veratrate. Curiously, it was shown that 
anaerobic conditions repressed the reducing activity of the fungus. On the contrary, 
flushing with air or oxygen had a positive effect on the conversion, indicating that 
anaerobic conditions were not responsible for the reduction of aldehydes and acids 
[221,262]. Hurst [263] showed that reductive enzymes are common in basidiomycetes 
and that two different enzymes are involved in the reduction of acid to aldehyde and 
aldehyde to alcohol. Cultures of the white-rot fungi P. chrysosporium [264-266], P. 
cinnabarinus [267] and T. versicolor [57,73,222] reduce both non-phenolic (veratrate 
and veratraldehyde) and phenolic (vanillate and vanillin) compounds to their 
corresponding aldehydes and alcohols. The reduction of aromatic aldehydes has also 
been described in strains of Fomes fomentarius [268], P. eryngii [269], Trametes 
hirsutus [73], Phlebia radiata [221] and Bjerkandera spp. [105]. 
Recently an intracellular aryl alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.91) from P. 
chrysosporium was purified and characterized [266]. The enzyme reduced 
veratraldehyde to veratryl alcohol using NADPH as a cofactor. Both methoxylated and 
45 Chapter 2 
hydroxylated compounds, including veratraldehyde and anisaldehyde, are substrates 
for the enzyme. Aromatic ketones, some of which are readily reduced by whole 
cultures of P. chrysosporium [270], are not substrates for this dehydrogenase. High 
glucose concentrations promotes reduction of aromatic acids to their corresponding 
alcohols [264]. However, when white-rot fungi are grown in a C-limited instead of N-
limited medium the aromatic aldehydes and acids are not reduced to the 
corresponding alcohols but rapidly metabolized to C02 and biomass [135,267,271-
273]. 
METABOLISM OF ARYL ALCOHOLS BY FUNGI 
We have seen that non-phenolic aryl alcohols have important physiological functions 
in the ligninolytic system of white-rot fungi. This means that white-rot fungi must 
regulate the biosynthesis and metabolization rates of the aryl metabolites, in order to 
maintain optimal concentrations of those compounds. The biosynthetic routes have 
been dealt with in section 3 and in this section the degradative routes will be 
discussed. 
A general point of interest in discussing the degradation of aryl aclohols by 
white-rot fungi is whether or not these fungi are able to grow on such compounds as 
sole source of carbon and energy. During the biodegradation of lignin and lignin model 
compounds several monomeric aromatic intermediates, including vanillate and 
syringate, were detected [20,21,27]. It is now generally accepted that white-rot fungi 
cannot use lignin as sole source of carbon and energy [3,4]. At present also no clear 
reports are available demonstrating unequivocally that ligninolytic fungi are indeed able 
to grow on monomeric aromatic compounds [274-279]. The weak lignin degrader S. 
commune may be an exception in this respect since it grew on sinapyl alcohol as sole 
carbon and energy source [280]. Fungi from other taxonomic groups, like the 
hyphomycete Penicillium simplicissimum, can readily use veratryl alcohol or vanillate 
as sole source of carbon and energy [279,282]. 
However, when an easily metabolized substrate like glucose is available, 
labelled veratryl alcohol and related compounds are metabolized in C02 and biomass 
[135,211,272,281]. T. versicolor, P. radiata and P. chrysosporium all degrade the 
phenolic compound vanillate much faster than the non-phenolic compound veratrate 
[267,283,284], indicating that the non-phenolic compounds are better protected 
against degradation. 
Partial oxidation of aryl alcohols may take place extracellularly by ligninolytic 
enzymes. Intracellularly, the compounds may be fully oxidized to carbon dioxide and 
46 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
water. The two degradative patterns will be discussed below. 
Aryl alcohols and extracellular ligninolytic enzymes 
In the extracellular environment of white-rot fungi, non-phenolic aryl alcohols with a 
distinct physiological function are present together with several ligninolytic enzymes. 
To maintain their physiological concentration, it is important that these compounds are 
not easily degraded by the aspecific extracellular ligninolytic enzymes.

Non-phenolic compounds: LiP catalyzed reactions. Veratryl alcohol is readily 
oxidized by LiP, while veratraldehyde and veratrate are not a substrate for this enzyme 
[222,270]. Initially it was thought that veratryl alcohol was stoichiometrically converted 
in veratraldehyde [142]. Upon closer examination, a number of other products was 
identified. In Figure 10 several reaction products of veratryl alcohol by LiP-catalyzed 
oxidation are presented. Although the major product is veratraldehyde (70 - 90 %), 
several quinones (10 % yield), and lactones resulting from ring cleavage (up to 20 % 
yield) are also formed. This product spectrum depends on both the pH and the 
concentration of Mn [236,238,272]. The formation of the quinones has not yet been 
studied in detail. Presently it is not known if dioxygen or oxygen from water is 
47 Chapter 2 
incorporated and if hydroquinones are intermediates. Much more is known about the 
ring-opening reactions. Shimada et al. [237,285] showed with elegant labeling 
experiments that one oxygen atom is derived from H20 and the other atom from 02 
(Figure 11). H20 reacts at the 3-position of veratryl alcohol radical cation while 02 
[237] or HOO* [236] reacts at the four position. Dioxygen is thus used as an electron 
acceptor producing HOO' as well as a reagent in the ring cleavage reaction (Figure 
10 and 11) [236,286].

Addition of Mn" increases the UP catalyzed oxidation of veratryl alcohol but inhibits the 
formation of ring-opened products [236]. The scavenging of superoxide anion which 
results in the formation of H202 was speculated to be the reason [181]. This result 
points to HOO* instead of 02 as the reactive species in the ring cleavage reaction. 
Recently, Tuor et al. [287] showed that c/s-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-3-
methoxy-cyclohex-2-en-one was a degradation product of LiP-catalyzed oxidation of 
veratryl alcohol via the intermediate quinone/hydroquinone (Figure 12). It is unclear 
how this compound is further metabolized. Re-aromatisation in 2-hydroxy-p-anisyl 
alcohol is possible at acid pH's. The latter compound is again substrate for 
extracellular phenol oxidases, however, the product of this reaction will presumably be 
48 Aryl alcohols In the physiology of ligninolytic fungi

Figure 12. The formation of 4-hydroxy-cyclohex-2-enone and the postulated aromatization reaction from 
a dynamic reduction equilibrium between quinone and hydroquinone (adapted from Tuor et al. [287]). 
It is anticipated that in an in vivo situation a pH of around 4.5 [238,272] and charge-
transfer reactions prevent the production of significant amounts of quinones and 
lactones (Figure 8). Consequently, only small quantites of the veratryl alcohol / 
veratraldehyde couple will be withdrawn from this system. Other de novo 
biosynthesized (chlorinated) anisyl alcohols are poor substrates for LiP. Oxidation of 
anisyl alcohol only resulted in low yields of anisaldehyde [230,231], while the 
chlorinated anisyl alcohols were not oxidized at all by LiP [105]. This means that the 
other couples are very stable against LiP-caused losses. 
MnP catalyzed reactions. Non-phenolic aryl alcohols, e.g. veratryl and anisyl alcohol, 
are not readily oxidized by MnP generated Mn'" [93,288]. While under standard 
conditions (pH 0, 0.1 M ionic strength) Mn'" can have a high standard redox potential 
of 1.5 V, a value comparable with LiP, under a normal physiological situation a redox 
potential of 0.9-1.2 V would not be high enough to oxidize veratryl alcohol [93,95]. 
However, the oxidation of small amounts of veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde with 
Mn"'/PPi, MnP/Mn"/oxalate [96] and Mn'"/acetate [97] systems has been reported. 
Also the results obtained with Mn"'/acetate mediated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
49 Chapter 2 
(PAH) oxidations show that under certain conditions Mn"'/acetate can slowly oxidize 
the same range of PAH compounds as LiP [289-292]. 
Forrester et al. [96] reported that the MnP-mediated oxidation of veratryl alcohol 
to veratraldehyde was strongly stimulated by gluthatione. Wariishi et al. [95] showed 
that in the presence of reducing compounds, including gluthatione, DTT or other thiol 
compounds, veratryl alcohol is oxidized in veratraldehyde by MnP/Mn"/malonate, 
Mn"'/malonate or y-irradiation systems. In the absence of thiol compounds no reaction 
was seen [93,95]. Anisyl and benzyl alcohol were oxidized at comparable rates, 
excluding any great influence of the substrates redox potential. It was proposed that 
thiyl radicals are formed instead of cation radical intermediates. Other peroxidases like 
horseradish peroxidase can also oxidize veratryl alcohol when thiol compounds are 
present [293].

Figure 13. The oxidation of veratryl alcohol by manganese peroxidase/thiol and laccase/ABTS 
complexes. Possible direct oxidation of veratryl alcohol to veratryl alcohol radical cation is also shown 
(adapted from [95,96,97,293,294]). 
We conclude therefore that two different systems are functioning (Figure 13). There 
is a direct oxidation of aromatic compound by Mn'" influenced by both the redox 
potential of the substrate, pH and chelator used. Additionally, in the presence of thiol 
compounds MnP or HRP generated thiyl radicals can abstract a hydrogen from the 
a-carbon to form a benzylic radical not much influenced by the ionization potential of 
the substrate. It is at the moment unclear if the Mn'" or thiyl catalyzed oxidation of 
veratryl alcohol is of any significance in vivo. 
50 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
Laccase catalyzed reactions. Recently, Bourbonnais and Paice [294] proposed an 
expanded role for laccase in lignin biodegradation. They showed that in the presence 
of the oxidizable substrate 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS), 
Trametes versicolor laccase can oxidize veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde (Figure 13). 
Also a laccase from Dichomitus squalens (syn. Polyporus anceps) can oxidize some 
substrates, as for instance the natural product pesticide rotenone, only in the presence 
of an electron transfer mediator i.e. chlorpromazine [295]. The laccase/ABTS mixture 
also cleaved a lignin model dimer [24] and hardwood kraft pulp was bleached to the 
same extent by a in vitro laccase/ABTS mixture compared to whole cultures [296]. 
However, during the bleaching of hardwood pulp the fungus did not produce a stable 
physiological equivalent of ABTS. The laccase/syringaldehyde couple can also oxidize 
veratryl alcohol, although with a lower activity [297]. Syringaldehyde is potentially 
present under physiological conditions since syringic acid is a common lignin 
degradation metabolite [27,29] and it is readily reduced by white-rot fungi. Thus 
syringaldehyde can potentially be considered as a physiological equivalent to ABTS 
mediated reactions. Future research should reveal if the simultaneous production of 
laccase and syringaldehyde plays a role in lignin biodegradation. 
The exact reaction mechanism is still unknown, but it was shown that the 
laccase/ABTS couple was the active species and not the ABTS*+ cation radical 
produced [294]. Muheim et al. [94] have re-examined the veratryl alcohol-
laccase/ABTS couple and concluded that the veratryl alcohol radical cation was not 
involved in the reaction sequence. During the oxidation of veratryl alcohol no quinones 
or ring-opened products were detected, and 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, a good UP 
substrate, was not oxidized. They concluded that a mechanism of hydrogen atom 
abstraction from the Ca-position leading to hydroxy substituted benzyl radicals, and 
subsequent oxidation to veratraldehyde takes place (Figure 13). The importance of 
oxidation and cleavage reactions by hydrogen atom abstraction in lignin degradation 
remains to be elucidated [94]. 
We propose that also in the LiP/veratryl alcohol catalyzed oxidation of anisyl 
alcohol and 4-methoxymandelate the charge-transfer reactions can be comparable 
with those seen with the laccase/ABTS couple [294]. This means that during this 
oxidation no radical cations but instead hydroxy-substituted benzyl radicals are 
produced [94]. In his review Schoemaker [20] also proposed the involvement of 
hydroxy-substituted 4-methoxybenzyl radical explaining the observed oxygen 
activation. He also postulated that this benzylic radical can serve as an efficient 
electron donor for the reduction of compound II to native enzyme. This hypothesis was 
strengthened by the results of Lundell et al. [121] with a 0-0-4 model dimer.

oxidation of vanillin/syringaldehyde to methoxyquinone and methoxyhydroquinone by laccase and 
manganese peroxidase (adapted from [161,288,297,299]). 
Phenolic compounds. Phenolic aromatic compounds are common lignin degradation 
products. It is expected that the different phenol oxidases react in the same way with 
the phenolic substrates [161,288,298]. With all enzymes, polymerization reactions 
frequently occur [299,300]. LiP and MnP oxidize phenolic compounds like vanillyl 
alcohol to aldehydes. Surprisingly, LiP also catalyzes the ring cleavage of this 
compound to the 6-lactone (Figure 14) [299]. When a compound is adequatly 
protected, like sterically hindered 4,6-di(tert)butylguaiacol, laccase can also oxidize 
such compounds to ring cleavage products in high yields instead of polymerizing the 
phenol [319]. Laccases from Rhizoctonia praticola and Trametes versicolor react pH-
dependent with vanillic and syringic acid. At a high pH of 6.9 the formed phenoxy 
radicals tend to polymerize while at pH 3.5 substantial amounts of the monomeric 
quinones are formed (Figure 15) [300]. Both MnP and laccase oxidize syringaldehyde 
and syringate to 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone as the main reaction product 
[161,288,297,301] (Figure 14). It was proposed that MnP oxidizes syringaldehyde to 
52 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone and formaldehyde in a single reaction step [161,288]. 
However, with laccase also 2,6-dimethoxyhydroquinone was found as a reaction 
product from syringaldehyde oxidation [297]. The formed hydroquinone is readily 
oxidized by laccase to the quinone [301]. In Figure 14 the two reaction mechanisms 
leading to quinone and hydroquinone are presented.

Metabolism of aryl alcohol metabolites by intracellular enzymes 
In the previous section 8.1 it was seen that all the de novo biosynthesized non-
phenolic aryl alcohols are well protected against the fungus's own extracellular 
ligninolytic enzymes. The only major products formed extracellularly are the 
corresponding aryl aldehydes which in turn are readily reduced to the corresponding 
alcohols. Also several other reports suggest that extracellular phenol oxidases are not 
important in the degradation of those monomeric aromatic compounds 
[127,211,264,273,276]. Nonetheless, the fungus can regulate the amount of 
extracellular aromatic compounds since several intracellular enzymes are acting on aryl 
alcohols and their degradation products. In this section we will consider alcohol and 
aldehyde dehydrogenases, hydroxylating enzymes, quinone:oxidoreductases and ring 
fission enzymes. 
At this point it should be stressed that no information is available on active 
transport mechanisms in white-rot fungi for aryl alcohols / aldehydes. Consequently, 
we at this stage presume these compounds either diffuse freely into the cells or are 
selectively taken up by transport systems still to be discovered. 
53 Chapter 2 
Alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. Basidiomycetes contain several enzymes 
that reduce aromatic acids and aldehydes to the corresponding aldehydes and 
alcohols [73,222,263,266,290] as discussed in section 7. However, all those 
oxidoreductases can also potentially catalyze the reverse reaction from alcohols to 
acids. There is at the moment not enough information available to determine under 
which culture conditions and for which substrates (phenolic or non-phenolic) whether 
oxidation or reduction will predominate. 
Hydroxylating enzymes. For most intracellular ring cleavage reactions the aromatic 
compounds should contain hydroxygroups. Such molecules can be obtained by 
introducing new hydroxygroups on the aromatic ring, by demethylating already existing 
methoxygroups or by oxidatively decarboxylating carboxygroups. 
Mono-oxygenases and cytochrome P-450 enzymes can introduce hydroxy 
groups. The hydroxylation of methyl-anisate by T. versicolor [302] and the conversion 
of 4-hydroxybenzoate to protocatechuate by P. chrysosporium [248] have been 
reported. However, the enzymes involved have not been characterized and their 
relevance in the metabolism of monomeric aromatic compounds is unknown. 
Much more is known about the demethylating activity of white-rot fungi, many 
fungi are capable of demethylating veratrate to vanillate [222,267]. In P. radiata, 
demethylation of 14C-OCH3 labelled veratrate occurs synchronously with LiP and MnP 
production [221], however the direct demethoxylation of veratryl metabolites by those 
enzymes has not yet been reported. This demethylating activity, but not the production 
of ligninolytic enzymes, is repressed by high glucose concentrations [267,273]. It has 
been speculated that factors or enzymes other than phenol oxidases may cause this 
demethylation [267,303], but no intracellular O-demethylase activity could be detected 
[267,281]. O-demethylases are very unstable enzymes and only a bacterial enzyme 
from Pseudomonas putida [304] has been thoroughly characterized. Only one report 
has been published describing the partial purification of a NADH dependent O-
demethylase from a basidiomycete (Xeromyces (syn. Xerocomus) badius) [305]. 
Vanillate and other phenolic compounds containing ortfto-methoxy groups are 
readily demethylated by phenol oxidases, but the product(s) of the reaction were not 
analyzed [19]. The conversion of vanillate to protocatechuate, indicating the action of 
a specific vanillate-O-demethylase, has not been found in both P. chrysosporium [275], 
P. cinnabarinus [267] and Gloeoporus (syn. Polyporus) dichrous [306]. 
Another way of introducing hydroxygroups is oxidative decarboxylation. Both 
laccase, LiP and MnP can catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of vanillate (Figure 
15). Also the oxidative decarboxylation of vanillate to methoxyhydroquinone by mycelial 
pellets of G. dichrous has been reported [306]. An intracellular, NADPH-dependent 
54 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
vanillate hydroxylase has been purified from P. chrysosporium [277,307]. This enzyme 
also has decarboxylating activity towards protocatechuate (94%) and to a lesser extent 
veratrate (9%). 
Quinone oxidoreductases. During the microbial degradation of lignin [20,21 ] and also 
xenobiotics [162,308] various quinones intermediates are formed. Also the oxidation 
of veratryl alcohol by LiP [238] and of vanillate by UP, MnP or laccase results in the 
formation of several different quinones. The rapid metabolism of those quinones was 
proposed as a mechanism to shift the equilibrium from enzymatic polymerization to the 
depolymerization of lignin [20,270]. Both intracellular and extracellular quinone 
reductases are present. 
At least two different intracellular NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases (EC 
1.6.99.2) are produced by P. chrysosporium [270,309,310]. One of the enzymes, a 
NADH:quinone oxidoreductase was purified [311]. This protein consists of several 
isozymes with broad substrate specificity and is induced by vanillic acid or 2-methoxy-
1,4-benzoquinone. 
The extracellular enzyme cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase is often linked with 
lignin degradation [312-314]. It was suggested that the reduction of phenoxy radicals 
formed by phenol oxidases may be important in preventing repolymerization reactions 
during lignin degradation. For example, the enzyme inhibited the phenol oxidase 
catalyzed decarboxylation of vanillate [239]. However, conflicting reports about this 
subject have appeared [239,315]. Recent research has shown that cellobiose:quinone 
oxidoreductase is a breakdown product of cellobiose dehydrogenase (previously 
known as cellobiose oxidase) [316-318]. It has been speculated that an important role 
of cellobiose dehydrogenase is the production of Fenton's reagent [255]. 
Ring fission. Ring cleavage of the aromatic moiety is necessary for a complete 
mineralization. In some cases phenol oxidases cause limited ring fission [236-
238,299,319]. However, fungi are known to contain at least three intracellular enzymes 
that cause ring cleavage of protocatechuate, catechol and 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, 
respectively [320]. Fungi only catalyze the ortfto-cleavage (intra-diol ring fission), 
whereas bacteria can give both intra- and extra-diol fission [320]. Protocatechuate is 
a key intermediate in the metabolism of many aromatic compounds both by bacteria 
and fungi [321]. Many hyphomycetes [279], including P. simplicissimum [282] 
metabolized vanillate via protocatechuate into 0-carboxy-c/s,c/'s-muconate. Also white-
rot fungi are thought to degrade vanillate via the same route [274,322]. Indeed, 
intracellular protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) has been purified from 
P. ostreatus [323,324]. However, protocatechuate could not be detected as an 
55 Chapter 2 
intermediate in the metabolism of veratrate or vanillate by several basidiomycetes, 
including P. chrysosporium [279]. Kirk and Lorenz [306] found that 
methoxyhydroquinone is the main intermediate in vanillate metabolism by G. dichrous. 
Also in the culture broth of several other basidiomycetes including Trametes sp. [325], 
P. cinnabarinus [267] and P. chrysosporium [264,279], methoxyhydroquinone was 
detected. Intracellular 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene-1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.-) is a 
common fungal enzyme [314,326], however specific enzymes which convert 
methoxyhydroquinone in 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene have not yet been described. Finally, 
1,2,4,5-tetrahydroxybenzene was detected as an intermediate of aromatic compound 
degradation [308]. However, it is not yet known if another specific dioxygenase is 
involved in this ring cleavage reaction. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Aryl (veratryl, anisyl and chlorinated anisyl) alcohols are common secondary 
metabolites of white-rot fungi. These compounds serve physiological functions together 
with extracellular enzymes involved in lignin biodegradation and their concentration in 
the extracellular fluid are highly regulated by intracellular enzymes. 
The fungus can produce the aryl alcohols by de novo biosynthesis from 
carbohydrates and by methylation and subsequent reduction of lignin degradation 
intermediates. It is anticipated that the metabolites are biosynthesized via phenylalanine 
but most enzymes and intermediates have not yet been characterized. The 
biosynthesis route of the chlorinated anisyl alcohols is still unclear. In cultures of white-
rot fungi no extracellular chloroperoxidase acivity has been found, while chlorinated 
tyrosines have been detected in other organisms. From these facts, we speculate that 
it is worthwile to consider chlorinated tyrosines as intermediates in the formation of 
chlorinated aryl alcohols. It is remarkable that such compounds, generally thought to 
be mainly of anthropogenic origin, are biosynthesized at high concentrations by white-
rot fungi in their natural environment. In our opinion these findings may have an 
important impact on the norms for chloroaromatics in the environment, and 
consequently it is necessary to fully determine the ubiquity of this capacity among 
fungi. The former belief that chloroaromatics were unnatural perhaps has hindered the 
search for chloroaromatic degrading microbes. Microbiologists will soon learn that 
such organisms are present in the close vicinity of CAM producing fungi. 
The secondary metabolites are produced simultaneously with the ligninolytic 
enzymes. Veratryl alcohol is an inducer of ligninolytic enzymes, but it is unclear if this 
is a physiologically important function. More importantly, it stabilizes lignin peroxidase 
56 Aryl alcohols in the physiology of ligninolytic fungi 
(LiP) by preventing inactivation and it can act as a charge-transfer mediator both in 
oxidation of other molecules including lignin and in the reduction of oxygen, generating 
active oxygen species. Further research is still necessary to attribute more precisely 
the role of charge-transfer reactions in lignin and xenobiotic biodegradation. 
Nonethless, it is clear that veratryl alcohol is vital for a proper functioning of LiP. The 
other aryl alcohols are not involved in stabilizing or mediating peroxidase reactions but 
they are excellent substrates for extracellular aryl alcohol oxidases (AAO) and generate 
H202. This is not the only H202-generating system available to white-rot fungi, but it 
may be an important alternative for many fungi. 
The aryl alcohol metabolites are stable in the aggressive extracellular ligninolytic 
system. The only significant conversion of the aryl alcohols is into their corresponding 
aldehydes. The formed aldehydes are readily recycled through their reduction to the 
corresponding alcohols by intracellular dehydrogenases. Thus constant alcohol levels 
are maintained for physiological purposes without the need for energy consuming 
biosynthesis of additional aryl alcohols. We think the fungus can regulate the levels of 
the aryl alcohols with the same intracellular enzymes involved in the catabolism of 
monomeric aromatic compounds released from lignin biodegradation. However, the 
routes and finetuning of biosynthesis and biodegradation of the aryl alcohols under 
different culture conditions needs further research. 
We have discussed the biosynthesis, physiological roles and biodegradation of 
aryl alcohols in lignin biodegradation, summarized and depicted in Figure 16. Lignin 
biodegradation by white-rot fungi is more than just enzymes, it is now clear that aryl 
alcohol metabolites are also important components involved in this degradation 
process. This ensures an even more challenging future for scientists involved in the 
genetic and biochemical characterization of lignin biodegradation.

ISOLATION AND SCREENING OF BASIDIOMYCETES 
WITH HIGH PEROXIDATIVE ACTIVITY

Rick P. van der Zwan and Jan A.M. de Bont 
SUMMARY 
Sixty-seven Poly R-478 decolorizing basidiomycetes were isolated with a selective 
medium (containing hemp (Cannabis sativa) stem wood, guaiacol and benomyl). 
Several of the new isolates were promising manganese peroxidase-containing white-rot 
fungi. Enzyme assays indicated that either glyoxal or aryl alcohol oxidase were present 
in the culture fluids of peroxidative strains. In contrast, lignin peroxidase was only 
detected in Phanerochaete chrysosporium, despite attempts to induce this enzyme in 
other strains with oxygen and oxygen / veratryl alcohol additions. A highly significant 
correlation was found between two ligninolytic indicators: ethene formation from a-
keto-v-methylthiolbutyric acid and the decolorization of a polymeric dye, Poly R. Three 
of the new isolates had significantly higher Poly R decolorizing activities compared to 
P. chrysosporium. The Poly R decolorization rate is a good assay when trying to 
optimize culture conditions for peroxidase / H202 production.

INTRODUCTION 
The possibilities of using white-rot fungi for hemp (Cannabis sativa L) biopulping, 
biobleaching and wastewater treatment processes are currently being evaluated. 
Previous work has focused on a limited number of white-rot species, e.g. 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds. and Trametes versicolor (L.:Fr.) Pilat (syn. 
Coriolus versicolor (L:Fr.) Quel.), but the lignin degradation rates and the selectivity 
with those fungi are low compared to chemical pulping and bleaching. Moreover, lignin 
degradation by various white-rot fungi is very much dependent on the type of growth 
substrate (Blanchette et al. 1988). Zadrazil (1985) tested eighty five culture collection 
strains for growth on sterile wheat straw. Maximum lignin degradation after 60 d 
incubation did not exceed 25 %. Also, the selectivity for lignin (% lignin loss / % weight 
loss) was, except for one Phellinus strain, always much lower than 1. Improvements 
in lignin degradation rates and selectivity may potentially be achieved by isolating and 
screening new wild ligninolytic strains. 
A selective medium is needed to isolate basidiomycetes from wood or soil 
samples, and media containing ort/io-phenylphenol (Russell 1956), benomyl and O-
phenylphenol (Coggins and Jennings 1975, Carey and Hull 1989), benomyl alone 
(Maloy 1974) and benomyl plus streptomycin sulfate (Dietrich and Lamar 1990) have 
been used. 
Many researchers have screened wood inhabiting fungi for selective lignin 
degradation, mainly employing chemical analyses of degraded wood (Setliff and Eudy 
1979, Zadrazil 1985), 14C-labelled lignin (Trojanowski and Huttermann 1987) or lignin 
model dimers (Enoki et al. 1988), but also ultrastructural aspects have been used 
(Otjen et al. 1987, Blanchette et al. 1988). These studies utilized previously 
characterized fungi, often from culture collections. A different approach was used by 
Nishida et al. (1988) to screen newly isolated strains. Their screening was based on 
the polymerization of guaiacol in wood powder agar plates caused by extracellular 
phenoloxidases and/or peroxidases excreted by the fungi. A good correlation was 
found between the formation of coloured zones and ligninolytic activity. Also some 
quantitative tests correlate ligninolytic activity with the conversion of simple substrates. 
Preston and McLennan (1948) used simple dyes (neutral red, gentian violet and congo 
red) to distinguish between brown- and white-rot fungi. Gold et al. (1988) have shown 
that polymeric dye (Poly R-481) decolorization coincides with lignin degradation by P. 
chrysosporium, manganese peroxidase being at least partly responsible for this 
decolorization (Kuwahara et al. 1984). Also, Chet et al. (1985) have shown a good 
correlation between the rate of Poly B-411 decolorization and lignin degradation by 
eight different white-rot fungi. Polymeric dyes have several advantages in a screening 
82 Screening for peroxidative basidiomycetes 
method; they are easy to use, inexpensive, stable, have a low toxicity and remain 
extracellular. Another test (Kelley 1988) uses the relationship between ethene formation 
from a-keto-v-methylthiolbutyric acid (KTBA), probably caused by hydroxyl radicals, 
and lignin degradation. Both polymeric dye decolorization and ethene formation assays 
are specific for peroxidases and show no activity when only laccase is present (Piatt 
et al. 1985, Kelley 1988). 
Screening programmes can also make use of direct enzymic assays. A large 
number of extracellular enzymes involved in lignin degradation are known from studies 
with P. chrysosporium (Kersten and Kirk 1987, Kirk and Farrell 1987), the most 
important being peroxidases (ligninase and manganese peroxidase) and oxidases 
(cellobiose oxidase, glyoxal oxidase etc.). 
This paper describes the isolation of several basidiomycetes with a selective 
medium containing hemp stem wood, benomyl and guaiacol. The aim was to select 
the most potent peroxidative strain, and to compare the different peroxidative tests 
with the production of extracellular ligninolytic enzymes. The fifteen most active, 
peroxidative fungi and five reference strains (including P. chrysosporium and 7". 
versicolor) were quantitatively tested for the decolorization of Poly R-478 and ethene 
formation from KTBA. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Organisms and culture conditions. P. chrysosporium BKM-F-1767 (ATCC 24725), 
P. chrysosporium SC 26, T. versicolor ATCC 20869 (ATCC, Rockville, USA), 
Bjerkandera adusta (Willd.iFr.) Karsten CBS 595.78, Trametes villosa (Fr.) Kreisel (syn. 
Polyporus pinsitus Fr.:Fr.) CBS 678.70 (CBS, Baarn, The Netherlands) and isolated 
strains were maintained at 4 °C on agar plates containing Bill medium (Kirk et al., 
1986) with (0.2%) hemp (Cannabis sativa Fibrimon; grown in The Netherlands in 1987) 
stem wood fibres and (0.02%) Poly R-478 (Sigma, St Louis, USA). Poly R-478 was 
included to confirm that isolates still contained Poly R decolorizing activity. In all 
experiments, serum bottles were inoculated with cylindrical agar plugs (6 mm 
diameter): all taken 3 cm from the initial inoculum, containing the following sterile 
media: 
(1) Hemp stem wood (HSW) medium, containing 2 g I'1 100-1000 Mm classified 
particles of hemp stem wood in 10 mM sodium 2,2-dimethylsuccinate (DMS), 
at pH 4.5. 
(2) Bill medium, prepared according to Kirk et al. (1986). 
(3) Kirk medium, containing glucose (1% w/v), DMS (10 mM), Bill, NH4 tartrate (0.2 
83 Chapter 3 
g I"1) and thiamin (2 mg I'1) according to Tien and Kirk (1988), veratryl alcohol 
and extra trace elements being omitted. All components were filter sterilized 
unless stated otherwise. 
Incubation was at 30 °C except with P. chrysosporium, which was grown at 37 °C. 
Isolation of fungi. A modified method of Nishida et al. (1988) was used for isolation 
of basidiomycetes. Pieces of rotted wood (about 1x0.5x0.5 cm) or a small amount of 
soil (about 1g) were placed in the centre of plates containing hemp stem wood (0.2%), 
guaiacol (0.01%), benomyl (Du Pont Chemical Co., Wilmington, USA, a 50% wettable 
powder) (15 ppm), agar (1.5%) and sometimes also chloramphenicol (200 ppm). 
Plates were incubated at either 28, 30 or 45 °C, and subcultures made as soon as 
browning of agar occurred (indicative of ligninolytic activity, Nishida et al. 1988) until 
the isolates were pure. 
All isolates were qualitatively tested for Poly R decolorization, as described 
below, 40 decolorizing strains were quantitatively tested so that 15 strains with highest 
decolorization rates could be selected for further study. The selected strains were 
identified by the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures (Baarn, The Netherlands). The 
following isolates were used: BOS55 a Bjerkandera sp.; E39, N11, S33 and probably 
also B41 a Trametes sp.; B47 Agaricales; B15 which is Polyporus brumalis (Pers.:Fr.) 
Fr. or Polyporus ciliatus (Fr.:Fr.) Fr.; H2, S54 and S22 which are Stereum hirsutum 
(Willd.:Fr.) Fr. or Stereum rugosum (Pers.:Fr.) Fr.; GM2 which is Daedaleopsis 
confragosa (Bolton:Fr.) Schroeter; W23 which is Chaetomium indicum Corda, a soft-
rot fungus; P30, H37 and B18 whose identity could not be determined. 
Poly R-478 decolorization. The method of Gold et al. (1988) was used with some 
modifications. Poly R-478 (anthrapyridone chromophore) was used since Poly R-481 
was no longer available and Poly R-478 was added before inoculation, because it 
appeared that this had no effect on the growth rate nor on the decolorization velocity 
of P. chrysosporium. Three different media were examined all containing Poly R-478 
(0.2 g I"1): HSW, filter sterilized and autoclaved (20 min, 121 °C) Kirk medium. Serum 
bottles (100 ml), closed with screw caps, containing 15 ml of medium were inoculated 
with agar plugs. Bottles were incubated statically in the dark at 30 °C (P. 
chrysosporium at 37 °C). During the first two weeks the bottles were flushed with air 
at least once a day and samples of the extracellular fluid (0.2 ml) were taken, 
centrifuged (5 min, 13000 g) and diluted 10-fold with water. Decolorization was 
measured by absorbance ratio (A520/A350 nm) decrease (Figure 1). The rates of Poly 
R decolorization (Table 1) were determined from these slopes. After 30 d incubation, 
the absorbance ratio (i.e. end value) was also measured. All measurements were done 
84 Screening for peroxidative basidiomycetes 
in triplicate. 
Ethene production. The method of Kelley (1988) was used with slight modifications. 
The fungi were grown in 100 ml serum bottles containing 5 ml HSW medium and 
closed with a cottonwool plug. Inoculation and incubation was as described above. To 
estimate peroxidative activity each day three serum bottles were closed with screw 
caps and a-keto-v-methylthiolbutyric acid (KTBA) (Sigma, St Louis, USA) (0.5 ml) was 
added to give a final concentration of 3.3 mM. Ethene production was measured, after 
2 h without addition of H2S04, using a Packard 430 (Delft, The Netherlands) gas 
chromatograph with a Porapak R column (Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands). 
Enzyme assays. For each strain, three serum bottles (100 ml) with 15 ml HSW 
medium and two with HSW medium plus Poly R-478 (0.2 g I"1) were inoculated and 
closed with cottonwool plugs. When the absorbance quotient of the Poly R bottles was 
between 1.0 and 0.8, the culture broth of the other 3 bottles was separated from the 
mycelium by centrifugation at 20000 g and assayed for the enzymes listed below. 
Spectrophotometric assays were done with a Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, USA) 550A UV-
Vis spectrophotometer at 30 °C. 
Laccase (Polyphenol oxidase). The oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) to an 
orange/brown dimer was used to measure laccase activity (e468nm ca 10000 M"1cm'1; 
Paszczynski et al. 1988). The reaction mixture contained up to 750 M' culture broth in 
50 mM DMS, pH 4.5, and 1 mM DMP in a total volume of 1 ml. 
Aryl (veratryl) alcohol oxidase (AAO). The oxidation of veratryl alcohol to 
veratraldehyde (e310nm 9300 M"1cm"1; Bourbonnais and Paice 1988) was followed. The 
reaction mixture contained up to 550 n\ culture broth in 50 mM DMS, pH 4.5, and 2 
mM veratryl alcohol in a total volume of 950 jul. 
Lignin peroxidase (LiP). Two methods were used. (1) Following Tien and Kirk (1988), 
the reaction mixture contained up to 550 MI culture broth in 50 mM sodium tartrate, pH 
2.5, and 2 mM veratryl alcohol (vacuum distilled) in a total volume of 1 ml. The 
reaction was started with 0.4 mM H202 and the formation of veratraldehyde was 
monitored. (2) After checking for AAO activity (see above) 0.4 mM H202 was added 
in a total volume of 1 ml (pH 4.5). 
Manganese peroxidase (MnP). The H202-dependent formation of an orange/brown 
product from DMP was used to assay MnP activity. The reaction mixture contained 50 
mM Na malonate, pH 4.5 (Wariishi et al. 1989), 1 mM DMP (Paszczynski et al. 1988), 
1 mM MnS04 and up to 650 /ul culture broth in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction 
was started by the addition of 0.4 mM H202 and corrected for laccase activity present.

Glyoxal oxidase (GLYOX). H202-producing activity of culture broth was determined by 
the method of Kersten and Kirk (1987). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM DMS 
pH 4.5, 10 mM glyoxal, 0.01% phenol red, 10 ng horseradish peroxidase (type II) 
(Sigma, St Louis, USA) and 300 /xl culture fluid in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction 
was stopped after 1 h by adding 50 /JI 2N NaOH, and then the mixture was assayed 
for phenol red oxidation at 610 nm against an appropriate blank. The H202-producing 
activity of culture broth was also assayed with other oxidase substrates including 
glucose, xylose, cellulose and lactose. 
Lignin peroxidase induction. For the induction of UP production (Tien and Kirk 1988) 
four serum bottles (100 ml) per strain with 15 ml HSW medium were inoculated, closed 
with screw caps and flushed with oxygen (10 min, 100 ml min'1). After 3 d veratryl 
alcohol (4 mM) was added to two bottles. During 2 wks, every day 700 MI medium was 
alternately withdrawn from two (one with and one without veratryl alcohol) of the four 
bottles. After sampling the two bottles were flushed (10 min, 100 ml min'1) with oxygen. 
In this experiment LiP activity was only assayed according to Tien and Kirk (1988). 
RESULTS 
Isolation of peroxidative fungi. With the HSW-benomyl-guaiacol medium more than 
400 plates gave brown-coloured zones but only 127 fungi were isolated to pure 
cultures. Different enrichment and isolation techniques gave no significant increase in 
the number of isolated fungi. It was impossible to isolate the colorizing fungi from 
several plates with brown-coloured zones because fast growing, sporulating fungi 
interfered. At 45 °C, no peroxidative fungi could be isolated although some plates 
gave brown-coloured zones. Only 67 of the isolated fungi were capable of Poly R 
decolorization. 
Poly R-478 decolorization. Typical examples of the time course of Poly R 
decolorization are presented in Figure 1. Although there was variation in the lag phase 
between replicates, the slopes during the period of maximum activity were similar and 
remained almost constant for at least 3 d. Based on the Poly R decolorization 
screening in the HSW medium, three of the newly isolated strains (undetermined P30, 
Trametes E39 and Agaricales B47) showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) peroxidative 
activity than the two P. chrysosporium strains (Table 1). The strain with the highest 
decolorization rate, undetermined P30, displayed almost twice as much activity as P. 
chrysosporium BKM in all three media tested. A good correlation was found between 
87 Chapter 3 
the decolorization rate of the same fungus in filter sterilized and autoclaved Kirk 
medium (coeffient of determination Ft2 = 0.83; P < 0.001) which indicates that filter 
sterilization is unnecessary.

-•- HSW medium and -+- autoclaved Kirk medium. 
The decolorization rate in HSW medium was generally twice the rate achieved in Kirk 
medium. The end values after one month incubation show the same differences 
between HSW and Kirk medium, indicating that not only the decolorization rate but 
also the total extent of decolorization was higher in the HSW medium. Although most 
strains had much higher activity on HSW medium, some strains, namely Polyporus 
B15 and Stereum S54, had lower activity on the HSW medium. 
Ethene production. Typical examples of the time course of ethene formation are 
presented in Figure 2, but note that the standard deviations observed were rather large 
(Figure 2; Table 2). As was the case in the Poly R screening, a number of newly 
isolated strains had higher levels of ethene production compared to the well 
characterized white-rot strains (Table 2). The strain with the highest ethene formation 
rate, Agaricales B47 had almost nine times more activity than P. chrysosporium BKM. 
A highly significant correlation (R2 = 0.48, P < 0.001) was found between both ethene 
production and Poly R decolorization, despite the large variation in the ethene 
production experiment (Figure 3). The two Poly R negative strains, undetermined B18 
88 Screening for peroxidative basidiomycetes 
and the soft-rot fungus C. indicum W23, included in the screening as blanks, showed 
no ethene formation.

Extracellular enzymes. The enzyme assays (Table 3) showed that all Poly R 
decolorizing strains have MnP activity. High laccase levels made the detection of MnP 
difficult with the assay method utilized, since the laccase activity had to be subtracted 
from the MnP activity. 
When AAO activity is present in the culture broth, veratryl alcohol is not an 
appropriate substrate for the UP assay. Both the high blank activity and the H202 
production by AAO make it difficult to distinguish these enzymes. Experiments were 
carried out to determine the effect of 02 and veratryl alcohol/02 on the UP production. 
In both cases, except for P. chrysosporium, no extracellular LiP production was 
detected in the culture broth of the other fungi. In cultures supplemented with veratryl 
alcohol, significant in vivo oxidation (as seen from the absorbance increase of the 
culture broth at 310 nm) occurred in all strains (not only those containing AAO), except 
for P. chrysosporium, undetermined B18 and C. indicum W23 (data not shown). The 
high starting absorbance at 310 nm in the LiP assay made it impossible to see an 
inductive role of veratryl alcohol for LiP production by the other fungi.

The horseradish peroxidase / phenol red assay revealed that mainly GLYOX could be 
detected in the extracellular fluids. With this assay other H202 producing oxidases 
could be detected in the extracellular fluids of three of the fungi. Trametes N11, 
Trametes E39 and Polyporus B15 had cellobiose oxidase activity on both cellobiose 
as well as lactose. Trametes E39 and Polyporus B15 showed oxidase activity with 
glucose and xylose. GLYOX was also detected in extracellular fluids of T. versicolor, 
B. adusta and D. confragosa GM2 when grown under an oxygen atmosphere. 
The Poly R negative strains, C, indicum W23 and undetermined B18 did not 
produce detectable levels of peroxidases nor oxidases; however small quantities of 
laccase were detected.

DISCUSSION 
The isolation and screening method described in this study has revealed several 
strains of fungi with higher peroxidative activities compared to the known reference 
strains. Three strains, undetermined P30, Trametes E39 and Agaricales B47, when 
grown on lignocellulosic substrate (HSW medium) were significantly more active in 
decolorizing Poly R compared to the two Phanerochaete strains. The ethene formation 
assay revealed two strains, Bjerkandera BOS55 and Agaricales B47, that were 
significantly more active than T. versicolor and the two Phanerochaete strains. The 
enzyme assays (Table 3) can only be viewed as qualitative because the evolution of 
the different enzymes was not measured with time. It is well known that the amount 
of several enzymes produced during secondary metabolism fluctuates considerably 
during the time course of cultivation (Szklarz et al. 1989). Furthermore, the ligninolytic 
enzymes in some fungi are strongly associated with the cell wall which gives an 
apparently low titre in the culture broth (Waldner et al. 1988). All the Poly R 
decolorizing strains secreted MnP. In contrast, LiP was only found in P. 
chrysosporium. Kuwahara et al. (1984) confirmed that the MnP of P. chrysosporium 
is at least partly responsible for the decolorization of Poly R. However, it is still possible 
that intracellular or cell wall bound LiP was present. Recently, Wariishi et al. (1991) 
have shown that MnP of P. chrysosporium has extensive lignin degrading capacities. 
Also, the decolorization of kraft lignin is mainly due to MnP activity (Michel et al. 1991). 
Many of the MnP secreting Poly R decolorizing fungi were also found to produce 
laccase. This is in agreement with the results of Nerud et al. (1991), but contrasts with 
those of Szklarz et al. (1989). Lin et al. (1991) have used DMP as a staining substrate 
for MnP activity present on the fungal mycelium. However, this method can only be 
used when the particular fungus studied does not have any laccase activity. 
Immunogold cytochemistry (Daniel et al. 1990) would distinguish between the different 
peroxidases both in vivo and in vitro. 
There is no clear correlation between Poly R decolorization or ethene formation 
(Tables 1 and 2) with enzyme activities (Table 3) assayed. It can be concluded 
therefore, that the decolorization rate of Poly R and ethene formation from KTBA is not 
related to any one enzyme in particular but to the 'complete' ligninolytic system 
(enzyme complex, secondary metabolites, H202 generation, etc.) (Gold et al. 1988). 
Some fungi displayed no activity on any of the oxidase substrates tested 
although Poly R decolorization did occur. Thus, it seems reasonable to expect that 
other enzymes, such as methanol oxidase, oxalic acid oxidase or manganese 
peroxidase (Paszczynski et al. 1988), play a role in the hydrogen peroxide production 
in those fungi. Both P. chrysosporium BKM and SC did not excrete detectable

amounts of cellobiose oxidase or glucose oxidase when grown on HSW medium, even 
though this enzyme has previously been found in this fungus (Ayers et al. 1978, Kelley 
and Reddy 1986). 15

A highly significant correlation (R2 = 0.48; P < 0.001) was found between Poly R 
decolorization and ethene formation (Figure 3). Therefore, either is suitable for 
detecting ligninolytic activity. However, when numerous fungi have to be tested for 
peroxidative activity, Poly R decolorization is recommended because of simpler 
methodology, low costs and high reproducibility. Furthermore, the rate of Poly R 
decolorization (Figure 1) is suitable for optimizing culture conditions. The high 
fluctuation in the lag periods prior to the first appearance of peroxidative activity 
(Figure 1) can possibly be reduced by inoculating with a homogeneous suspension 
of mycelium instead of agar plugs, which in turn can reduce the standard deviation in 
the ethene formation (Figure 2) significantly. 
While the decolorization rate of Poly R was stable for several days, ethene 
production gave sharp peaks during the time course of the assay. Datta et al. (1991) 
published analogous results for the peak in peroxidase activity and the linear 
absorbance increase of aspen pulp extract. 
The results indicate that there are roughly two groups of fungi, one producing 
GLYOX and the other producing AAO. This constitutes yet another example of major 
differences existing in the ligninolytic system of different white-rot fungi. It also stresses 
again the importance of studying other white-rot fungi than the well known P. 
chrysosporium and T. versicolor to get a better insight in the diversity of the ligninolytic 
93 Chapter 3 
system occurring in nature. 
The newly isolated strains are currently being tested for biopulping, lignin 
degradation and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation to evaluate the benefits of 
this isolation and screening procedure for practical applications.

EVIDENCE FOR A NEW EXTRACELLULAR PEROXIDASE: 
MANGANESE INHIBITED PEROXIDASE FROM THE WHITE-ROT FUNGUS 
BJERKANDERA SP. BOS55 
Ed de Jong, Jim A. Field and Jan A.M. de Bont 
SUMMARY 
A novel enzyme activity was detected in the extracellular fluid of Bjerkandera sp. 
BOS55. The purified enzyme could oxidize several compounds like phenol red, 2,6-
dimethoxyphenol (DMP), Poly R-478, 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic 
acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and guaiacol with H202 as an electron acceptor. In 
contrast, veratryl alcohol was not a substrate. This enzyme also had the capacity to 
oxidize DMP in the absence of H202. 
With some substrates, a strong inhibition of the peroxidative activity by Mn" was 
observed. Phenol red oxidation was inhibited by 84% with only 1 mM of this metal ion. 
Because DMP oxidation by this enzyme is only slightly inhibited by Mn", this substrate 
should not be used in assays to detect manganese peroxidase. The enzyme is 
tentatively named "Manganese Inhibited/Independent Peroxidase".

INTRODUCTION 
White-rot fungi are capable of depolymerizing lignin and metabolizing it to C02 and 
H20. The ligninolytic enzyme complex of the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has 
been studied most extensively. Two extracellular peroxidases, ligninase (UP) and 
manganese peroxidase (MnP), are thought to have an important role in the initial lignin 
degradation (Kirk and Farrell 1987, Wariishi et al. 1991). Both peroxidases were 
discovered in the extracellular fluid of this organism (Tien and Kirk 1983, Glenn and 
Gold 1983, Kuwahara et al. 1984). The mechanism of lignin model compound 
oxidation by LiP was elucidated in 1985 (Schoemaker et al. 1985), but its exact 
function in lignin degradation is still a point of dispute (Hammel and Moen 1991, 
Sarkanen et al. 1991). Also there are conflicting reports on the importance of MnP in 
the ligninolytic system (Wariishi et al. 1991, Perez and Jeffries 1990). 
Waldner et al. (1988) and Nerud et al. (1991) have detected extracellular 
peroxidase activity in the culture fluids of various white-rot fungi (Bjerkandera adusta, 
Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Dichomitus squalens) that cannot be attributed to LiP 
or MnP. Moreover, the unknown peroxidase activity on ABTS or phenol red was 
inhibited by Mn". 
In this study, we present the isolation and initial characterization of an 
manganese inhibited/independent peroxidase from the white-rot fungus Bjerkandera 
sp. BOS55. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Organism and culture conditions. BOS55 was isolated from forest soil samples with 
a selective medium containing hemp (Cannabis sativa) stem wood (0.2%), benomyl 
(15 ppm), guaiacol (0.01%) and agar (1.5%). BOS55 was determined as a Bjerkandera 
sp. by the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS, Baarn, The Netherlands). 
The fungus was maintained on malt agar plates at 4 ° C. BOS55 was cultivated under 
static conditions at 30° C in 5 I erlenmeyer flasks on hemp stem wood medium (500 
ml containing 0.2% hemp stem wood in 10 mM dimethylsuccinate pH 4.5). Cultures 
were inoculated with two cylindrical agar plugs (6 mm diameter) from the agar plates. 
Enzyme purification. Medium from 10-12 day old cultures was centrifuged at 20,000 
g for 30 minutes to remove mycelium. The supernatant was filtered through a 595Vfe 
filter (Schleichel & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and concentrated on DEAE-Sepharose 
CL-6B column (25 x 2.8 cm). The adsorbed protein was washed with starting buffer 
102 Manganese inhibited peroxidase 
(100 ml) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCI in 10 mM sodium acetate 
pH 5.5. Active fractions (250-350 mM NaCI) were pooled, washed with 10 mM sodium 
acetate pH 5.5 and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a PM-10 membrane 
(Amicon, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Two ml of the concentrated fraction was 
purified with gel filtration. Using Sephadex G-100 gel chromatography with 20 mM 
sodium acetate 0.1 M NaCI pH 5.5 buffer (47 ml hour'1, column 65 x 1.7 cm), one 
peak of activity was obtained. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated and washed 
as described above. Concentrated enzyme oxidized 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) with 
an activity of 0.037 absorbance units min'1 (MI supernatant)"1. 
Native-PAGE was performed with 2 jul of the washed G-100 fraction on a Phast 
system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). 
Analytical methods. Peroxidase activity was measured by the oxidation of phenol red 
at 510 nm or DMP at 468 nm. The reaction mixture contained up to 300 n\ culture 
broth or enzyme solution in 50 mM sodium tartrate pH 4.0 and 0.01% phenol red or 
2 mM DMP. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.4 mM H202 in a total volume 
of 0.5 ml. 
Chemicals. DEAE-sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-100 are products of Pharmacia 
(Uppsala, Sweden). Horseradish peroxidase grade II (HRP), dithiotreitol (DTT) and 
ABTS were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). All other chemicals were 
commercially available and used without further purification. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In the extracellular fluids of 10-12 day-old cultures of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, a new 
peroxidase was found that oxidizes phenol red. The purified peroxidase seems to be 
different from LiP and MnP. The new peroxidase showed no activity with veratryl 
alcohol, which is an indicative substrate for LiP. Moreover, the new peroxidase 
oxidized DMP which is not a substrate of LiP (Paszczynski et al. 1986). Although DMP 
is oxidized by MnP (Paszczynski et al. 1986), the new enzyme is not stimulated by Mn" 
addition and moreover, the oxidation of phenol red is actually strongly inhibited by 
Mn". For this reason, the new peroxidase is tentatively denominated as manganese 
inhibited/independent peroxidase (MIP). The fact, that the activity was truly due to an 
enzyme, was confirmed by observing the loss of all activity after 20 minutes of boiling. 
MIP was also able to oxidize DMP in the absence of H202.

and the other half in 50 mM sodium tartrate pH 4.7 
containing 2 mM DMP (2).

As shown in Figure 1, the normalized peroxidase and oxidase activities in the different 
fractions from sephadex G-100 gel chromatography were identical, indicating that the 
same enzyme was involved. To test this hypothesis, native-PAGE electrophoresis was 
performed. As can be seen in Figure 2, both oxidase and peroxidase staining with 
DMP occurred in the same protein band which confirms that the oxidase and the 
104 Manganese inhibited peroxidase 
peroxidase activities originate from the same enzyme. 
The occurrence of both oxidase and peroxidase activities in the same enzyme 
was also noted by Blaich and Esser (1975). Additionally, we found that even HRP 
displayed limited oxidase activity with DMP as substrate. It is known (McEldoon and 
Dordick 1991) that HRP has oxidase activity with dihydroxyfumaric acid. With phenol 
red as substrate, MIP did not have detectable levels of oxidase activity. Extracellular 
fluid of Bjerkandera adusta (Muheim et al. 1990a, Muheim et al. 1990b) has both 
peroxidase as oxidase activity with veratryl alcohol. In that case two distinct enzymes 
are involved, lignin peroxidase and veratryl (aryl) alcohol oxidase. 
The pH optima for the oxidation of DMP in the absence and presence of H202 
were 4.5 and 3.8, respectively (Figure 3). Almost the same pH optimum for peroxidase 
activity with phenol red and DMP was found (Figure 4). As can be seen in Figure 3, 
the oxidase activity at pH 4.0 accounted for only 10% of the total activity with DMP as 
substrate.

tartrate buffers (Total activity (•)). Peroxidase activity (») was calculated by substracting the oxidase 
activity from the total activity. 
Several substrates were tested for oxidation by MIP and HRP, both in the presence 
and absence of Mn". It was found that with both enzymes the oxidation of some 
substrates were inhibited by manganese (Table 1). Because the protein concentration 
in the purified fraction was too low to assay, only a relative comparison of the MIP and 
105 Chapter 4 
HRP substrate oxidation rates can be made. The MIP/HRP activity ratios of most of 
the substrates were comparable within one order of magnitude. However DMP formed 
an important exception, since the activity ratio on this substrate was from 10 to 49 
times higher compared to the other substrates.

red oxidation rate. Mixtures contained 
0.01% phenol red and 0.4 mM H202 in

The data presented in Table 2 show that DMP oxidation by MIP was markedly inhibited 
by sodium azide and potassium cyanide, which are both potent inhibitors of 
hemeprotein catalyzed reactions. On the contrary, 1 mM of EDTA did not cause 
significant inhibition. In this respect, MIP is quite distinct from both LiP and MnP since 
several research groups report that these enzymes are highly inhibited by 1 mM EDTA 
(Kuwahara et al. 1984, Tuisel et al. 1990). Glenn and Gold (1985) did not find inhibition 
of MnP by 1 mM EDTA when excess manganese was present.

Not determined. 
The results of this study clearly indicate that aside from LiP and MnP, another 
peroxidase, MIP, is produced by white-rot fungi. Although we have only demonstrated 
the presence of MIP in one white-rot strain, the unknown peroxidase activity previously 
found in the extracellular culture fluids of various white-rot fungi (Waldner et al. 1988, 
Nerud et al. 1991) has striking similarities since the activity is also inhibited by Mn". 
This seems to indicate that MIP is a ubiquitous enzyme of white-rot fungi. At present, 
it is not clear what role MIP plays in lignin degradation. Therefore, future studies 
should be directed at elucidating the function that MIP serves in the ligninolytic system 
of white-rot fungi. In any case, based on the fact that a third peroxidase has been 
isolated from a white-rot fungus, the standard methods of measuring peroxidase 
activity in extracellular culture fluids must be reconsidered. This is particularly important 
for some substrates used for detecting MnP, such as DMP, which is also readily 
oxidized by MIP even in the presence of Mn". Phenol red is a better substrate for 
distinguishing between MnP and MIP, since the oxidation is almost completely inhibited 
by Mn". Furthermore, this study stresses once again that some peroxidases have 
phenol oxidizing activity, which suggests that phenol oxidation in the absence of H202 
is not really a suitable method for distinguishing laccases from peroxidases.

SUMMARY 
The white-rot fungus Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 produced de novo several aromatic 
metabolites. Besides veratryl alcohol and veratraldehyde, compounds which are known 
to be involved in the ligninolytic system of several other white-rot fungi, other 
metabolites were formed. These included anisaldehyde, 3-chloro-anisaldehyde and a 
yet unknown compound containing two chlorine atoms. Additionally GC/MS analysis 
revealed the production of small amounts of anisyl alcohol and 3-chloro-anisyl alcohol. 
After 14 days, the extracellular fluid of Bjerkandera BOS55 contained 100 MM 
veratraldehyde and 50 /xM 3-chloro-anisaldehyde. This is the first report of de novo 
biosynthesis of simple chlorinated aromatic compounds by a white-rot fungus. 
Anisaldehyde and 3-chloro-anisaldehyde were also produced by Bjerkandera adusta 
but not by Phanerochaete chrysosporium.

INTRODUCTION 
White-rot fungi, which belong to the basidiomycetes, are the most effective lignin 
degraders in nature. The best characterized white-rot fungus is Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium (Buswell 1992). Besides the complex and heterogeneous aromatic 
biopolymer lignin, this fungus is also able to degrade a wide range of xenobiotics, 
including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pentachlorophenol (Aust 1990; Field 
et al. 1992). Lignin biodegradation results from the combined action of several 
enzymes working together in narrow co-operation. 
An interesting aspect of the lignin degrading system of P. chrysosporium, is the 
involvement of a aromatic metabolite, veratryl alcohol. Addition of veratryl alcohol to 
whole cultures of P. chrysosporium increases the lignin degrading activity (Buswell 
1992). Veratryl alcohol is an important substrate for one of the key enzymes in lignin 
degradation, lignin peroxidase (Buswell 1992; Tien and Kirk 1988). Furthermore, 
veratryl alcohol protects this enzyme from inactivation by H202 (Haemmerli et al. 1986; 
Valli et al. 1990). Veratryl alcohol is biosynthesized de novo by P. chrysosporium 
(Lundquist and Kirk 1978) and various other white-rot fungi including Bjerkandera 
adusta (Berger et al. 1986), Pycnoporus cinnabarinus (Hatakka 1985), Phlebia radiata 
(Kantelinen et al. 1986) and Trametes versicolor (Kawai et al. 1988). Phenylalanine, 3,4-
dimethoxycinnamyl alcohol and veratrylglycerol are intermediates during the 
biosynthesis of veratryl alcohol by P. chrysosporium (Shimada et al. 1981). 
Many simple, aromatic compounds derived from intermediates of the shikimic 
acid pathway are produced by fungi (Turner and Aldridge 1983). However, veratryl 
alcohol is the only metabolite known to play a definite role in lignin biodegradation. In 
the present paper we report the de novo biosynthesis of other aromatic metabolites, 
3-chloro-anisaldehyde and anisaldehyde by white-rot fungi of the genus Bjerkandera. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Microorganisms. Bjerkandera adusta (Willd.:Fr.) Karsten CBS 595.78 was obtained 
from the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS, Baarn, the Netherlands). 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds. BKM F-1767 (ATTC 24725) was a kind gift from 
Prof. T.K. Kirk. Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 was isolated and determined as described 
before (de Jong et al. 1992). Strains were maintained at 4° C on hemp {Cannabis 
sativa L) stem wood (0.2%) - Bill (Tien and Kirk 1988; de Jong et al. 1992) medium 
from which they were transferred to malt extract plates (1.5% agar, 0.35% malt extract, 
0.5% glucose) and experiments were inoculated with one agar plug as described 
114 3-Chloro-anisaldehyde 
before (de Jong et al. 1992). 
Culture conditions. The standard basal medium used in the experiments was N-
limited liquid Bill medium (Tien and Kirk 1988) with 10 g I"1 glucose in 20 mM 2,2-
dimethylsuccinate (pH 4.5) buffer. The medium was autoclaved and a filter-sterilized 
thiamine solution (200 mg I"1) was added (10 ml I"1) afterwards. For measuring the time 
course of aromatic metabolites production, five-ml aliquots of Bill medium were placed 
in 30 ml loosely capped serum bottles and experiments were incubated statically 
(unshaken) under an air atmosphere at 30 °C. For the analysis of mass and 1H-NMR 
spectra 500 ml aliquots of Bill medium were placed in 5 I erlenmeyers closed with a 
cotton plug. After inoculation the bottles were incubated statically for 30 days at 30 ° C. 
Isolation and identification of aromatic metabolites. To measure the amount of 
aromatic metabolites the entire culture (5 ml) was utilized for the extraction procedure. 
Consequently, separate cultures were prepared and analyzed in quadruplet on each 
sampling day. Sterile medium was incubated as an abiotic control. Acetonitrile (10 ml) 
was added to the culture bottles (5 ml medium, corrected for water evaporation 
losses), sealed with teflon lined silicon septa and extracted for one hour on a shake 
table (300 strokes min"1; stroke = 2cm). A two ml subsample of the extract was 
centrifuged (10 min, 13000 rpm) and 50 /uL was injected into the HPLC. 
For mass and 1H-NMR spectra analysis 500 ml of culture broth was filtered (de 
Jong et al. 1992). The supernatant was saturated with NaCI and extracted with 2x10 
ml dichloromethane. The organic phase was evaporated and this crude fraction was 
used for total mass spectra analysis. HPLC purified unknown compounds (20 
combined injections) were used, after evaporation of the solvent with N2, for mass and 
1H-NMR spectra analysis. 
Synthesis of authentic compounds. 3-chloro-anisyl alcohol (3-chloro-4-
methoxybenzyl alcohol) was prepared from 3-chloro-4-methoxybenzoic acid by 
reduction with borane (BH3) in tetrahydrofuran (Yoon et al. 1973). 
1H-NMR (CDCI3) 6 (ppm): 3.03 (br s, -OH); 3.82 (s, -OCH3); 4.46 (s, -CH2-); 
6.81 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, aromatic-H5); 7.10 (dd, J = 2.0, 6.5 Hz, aromatic-H6); 7.27 (d, J 
= 2.0 Hz, aromatic-H2). 
13C-NMR (CDCI3) 5 (ppm): 55.92 (q); 63.74 (t); 111.73 (d); 121.99 (s); 126.26 
(d); 128.79 (d); 133.79 (s); 154.03 (s). 
3-Chloro-anisaldehyde (3-chloro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde) was prepared from 
3-chloro-anisyl alcohol by a gentle oxidation with pyridinium dichromate in dry 
dichloromethane (Corey and Schmidt 1979). Melting point 61-62°C.

Instruments. Supernatant (50 MO was routinely analyzed on a Hewlett Packard HPLC 
Chemstation (Pascal series) (Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a HP1050 pumping 
station, a HP1040 M series II diode array detector and a HP9000-300 data processor. 
The column (200 mm x 3 mm) filled with ChromSpher C18-PAH (5 nm particles) was 
from Chrompack (Middelburg, the Netherlands). Aromatic metabolites were analyzed 
with the following gradient (0.4 ml min'1, 30 °C): 90:10, 0:100 and 0:100 H20:CH3CN 
at 0, 15 and 20 minutes, respectively. The UV absorbance was monitored at 2 nm 
wavelength intervals from 210 to 350 nm. 
Mass spectra were measured with a Hewlett Packard HP5890 GC with 30 m 
DB17 column and a HP5970 MSD. Injection temperature was 200 °C. The starting 
temperature of the column was 80°C, gradient 7°C min"1, final temperature 240°C. 
Helium was used as carrier gas (20 ml min"1). 
1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AC-E200 
spectrometer (Rheinstetten-Forchheim, Germany). Synthesized compounds and HPLC 
purified metabolite were dissolved in CDCI3. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal 
standard. 
Chemicals. Veratryl alcohol, veratraldehyde, anisyl alcohol (4-methoxybenzyl alcohol), 
anisaldehyde (4-methoxybenzaldehyde) were from Janssen Chimica (Tilburg, the 
Netherlands). 3-Chloro-4-methoxybenzoic acid was from Heraeus (Karlsruhe, 
Germany). 
RESULTS 
Identification of aromatic metabolites. When grown in a synthetic medium with 
glucose as sole source of carbon and energy, Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 produced 
several aromatic metabolites. Atypical HPLC plot of a 14-day-old supernatant is shown 
in Figure 1. In the 14-day-old sterile synthetic medium none of the aromatic 
metabolites were detected. The aromatic metabolites were identified by extracting the 
supernatant with dichloromethane and analyzing the organic phase on GC/MS. In 
addition to veratraldehyde and veratryl alcohol, Bjerkandera BOS55 produced 
116 3-Chloro-anisaldehyde 
anisaldehyde and 3-chloro-anisaldehyde. Furthermore a yet unknown peak was 
detected (Figure 1) which, based on GC/MS analyses, contained 2 chlorine atoms.

Figure 2. Mass spectra of 3-chloro-anisyl alcohol and 3-chloro-anisaldehyde 
With the GC/MS, small amounts of anisyl alcohol and 3-chloro-anisyl alcohol were also 
detected in 30-day-old cultures. The mass spectra of synthesized 3-chloro-anisyl 
alcohol and synthesized 3-chloro-anisaldehyde are given (Figure 2). In Figure 3, the 
normalized UV-spectra of both 3-chloro-anisyl alcohol and 3-chloro-anisaldehyde are 
presented. For all aromatic metabolites detected with HPLC (Figure 1), the HPLC 
retention times, the UV spectra, the GC retention times and the mass spectra were 
identical to authentic compounds. 3-Chloro-anisaldehyde biosynthesized by 
Bjerkandera BOS55 was purified with HPLC. Its 1H-NMR spectrum (1H-NMR (CDCI3) 
S (ppm): 3.98 (-OCH3); 7.03, 7.77, 7.90 ring protons; 9.84 (-CHO)) was identical to the 
spectrum of the synthesized compound. 
Biosynthesis of aromatic metabolites by Bjerkandera BOS55. A typical time course 
of aromatic metabolite production by BOS55 is given in Figure 4. Although the amount 
of anisaldehyde decreases to very low concentrations after 14 days (Figure 1 and 4) 
it was still detectable. This is shown with the UV spectrum which fits quite well with the 
spectrum of the standard (Figure 1C). For most compounds, maximum concentration 
was reached after 10 (3-chloro-anisaldehyde (50 nM) and anisaldehyde (3 MM)) to 14 
(veratraldehyde (100 JLIM)) days of incubation (Figure 2), only the amount of veratryl 
alcohol showed a significant increase during the rest of the experiment.

Biosynthesis of aromatic metabolites by other strains. Formation of the newly 
detected aromatic metabolites was also investigated in B. adusta and P. 
chrysosporium. Bjerkandera adusta produced the same aromatic metabolites as 
Bjerkandera BOS55 as judged by HPLC and GC/MS. The metabolites occurred at 
similar concentrations in both Bjerkandera spp., except that the anisaldehyde (20 nM) 
concentration was higher in the supernatant of B. adusta. P. chrysosporium, however, 
only produced veratryl alcohol (0.1 mM after 14 days) as observed by HPLC analysis 
of the supernatant. GC/MS analysis also revealed trace amounts of veratraldehyde. 
Anisyl alcohol, 3-chloro-anisyl alcohol or the respective aldehydes, were not detectable 
by GC/MS. 
DISCUSSION 
Veratryl alcohol and veratraldehyde are known aromatic metabolites excreted by white-
rot fungi which play an important role in lignin degradation (Buswell 1992). In the 
present article we show that white-rot fungi of the genus Bjerkandera produce two 
more pairs of aromatic metabolites not formed by P. chrysosporium: anisyl alcohol and 
anisaldehyde, 3-chloro-anisyl alcohol and 3-chloro-anisaldehyde. In contrast with P. 
119 Chapter 5 
chrysosporium, B. adusta produces an extracellular aryl alcohol oxidase (Muheim et 
al. 1990), thought to be an important enzyme in the generation of H202. This enzyme 
oxidizes both veratryl alcohol and anisyl alcohol, displaying higher activity with the 
latter (Muheim et al. 1990). Preliminary results indicate that 3-chloro-anisyl alcohol is 
also a substrate for the aryl alcohol oxidase, suggesting that this alcohol is the 
precursor to 3-chloro-anisaldehyde.

As far as we know this is the first report of the de novo biosynthesis of 3-chloro-anisyl 
alcohol by fungi. On the contrary anisaldehyde and 3-chloro-anisaldehyde discovered 
in the Bjerkandera spp. are known aromatic metabolites of other fungi. Lepista diemii 
produces 3-chloro-anisaldehyde (Thaller and Turner 1972), anisaldehyde is produced 
by several fungi including Camarophyllus virgineus (Farrell et al. 1977), Trametes 
suaveolens (Birkinshaw et al. 1944), Daedalea juniperina (Birkinshaw and Chaplen 
1955) and Ischnoderma benzoinum (Berger et al. 1987). Berger et al. (1986) screened 
many fungi for the production of flavours and fragrances. They found that B. adusta 
biosynthesizes anisaldehyde and veratraldehyde de novo and concluded that this 
fungus is a potential flavour producer. In this work we have demonstrated that under 
120 3-Chloro-anisaldehyde 
certain culture conditions Bjerkandera spp. also form undesirable chlorinated products. 
Biohalogenation is not a rare event in nature, at the moment more than 700 
halogenated compounds are known (Neidleman 1975). This is, however, the first 
report of chlorinated aromatics production by a white-rot fungus. 
We conclude that the ligninolytic complexes of P. chrysosporium and 
Bjerkandera spp. differ significantly both with respect to enzymes (aryl alcohol oxidase 
(Muheim et al. 1990) and manganese inhibited peroxidase (de Jong et al. 1992)) and 
aromatic metabolites produced. Further research in the physiological and ecological 
role of the above described aromatic metabolites in lignin degradation is therefore 
necessary.

PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE OF CHLORINATED ARYL ALCOHOLS 
BIOSYNTHESIZED DE NOVQ BY THE WHITE-ROT FUNGUS 
BJERKANDERA SP. BOS55 
Ed de Jong, Anne E. Cazemier, Jim A. Field and Jan A.M. de Bont 
SUMMARY 
The white-rot fungus Bjerkandera spp. BOS55 produces veratryl, anisyl, 3-chloroanisyl 
and 3,5-dichloroanisyl alcohol and the corresponding aldehydes de novo from glucose. 
All metabolites are produced simultaneously with the extracellular ligninolytic enzymes 
and have an important physiological function in the fungal ligninolytic system. Both 
mono- and dichlorinated anisyl alcohols are distinctly better substrates for the 
extracellular aryl alcohol oxidases compared to veratryl alcohol. The formed aldehydes 
are readily recycled by reduction by washed fungal mycelium, thus creating an 
extracellular H202 production system regulated by intracellular enzymes. Lignin 
peroxidase does not oxidize the chlorinated anisyl alcohols both in the absence and 
in the presence of veratryl alcohol. It was therefore concluded that the chlorinated 
anisyl alcohols are well protected against the fungus's own aggressive ligninolytic 
enzymes. The relative amounts of veratryl alcohol and the chlorinated anisyl alcohols 
differ significantly depending on the growth conditions, indicating that the production 
of veratryl alcohol and the (chlorinated) anisyl metabolites are independently regulated. 
We conclude that the chlorinated anisyl metabolites, biosynthesized by the 
white-rot fungus Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, can be purposeful for ecologically significant 
processes such as lignin degradation.

INTRODUCTION 
White-rot fungi are an important group of microorganisms responsible for the 
biodegradation of lignin (Kirk and Farrell 1987, Buswell 1992). Extracellular 
peroxidases, lignin peroxidase (UP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP), are involved 
in the initial attack of the complex aromatic lignin polymer (Kirk and Farrell 1987) as 
well as aromatic xenobiotic compounds (Field et al. 1993). Lignin degradation and 
ligninolytic enzyme production by the model fungus, P. chrysosporium is a secondary 
metabolic event triggered by nitrogen, carbon or sulfur limitation (Kirk and Farrell 1987, 
Buswell 1992). Concurrently with the production of extracellular peroxidases, P. 
chrysosporium (Lundquist and Kirk 1978) and several other white-rot basidiomycetes 
(Gallois et al. 1990, Buswell 1992, de Jong et al. 1992b), produce a secondary 
metabolite, veratryl alcohol de novo from glucose. Since it was observed that the 
addition of veratryl alcohol to the culture broth increases lignin degradation, UP 
production and LiP stability (Faison and Kirk 1985, Leisola et al. 1985, Haemmerli et 
al. 1986, Leisola et al. 1988), an extensive discussion has been unleashed over which 
physiological role(s) veratryl alcohol plays in lignin degradation. Four roles for veratryl 
alcohol in the ligninolytic system have been proposed. Firstly, the addition of 
exogenous veratryl alcohol was thought to induce lignin degradation and the 
production of LiP protein (Faison and Kirk 1985, Leisola et al. 1988). However, recent 
research seems to negate this role (Cancel et al. 1993). Secondly, veratryl alcohol 
functions to prevent inactivation of LiP by H202 (Haemmerli et al. 1986, Valli et al. 
1990) and to convert inactive LiP compound III back to the native enzyme (Cai and 
Tien 1992). Thirdly, it has been postulated that veratryl alcohol functions as a charge-
transfer mediator between the enzyme and a third substrate (Harvey et al. 1986, 
Harvey et al. 1992). However, this function has not yet been generally accepted (Valli 
et al. 1990). Results obtained with monomethoxy-substituted aromatic substrates 
(Harvey et al. 1986, Fawer et al. 1991), oxalic acid (Akamatsu et al. 1990, Popp et al. 
1990) and polymeric dyes (Paszczynski and Crawford 1991) demonstrate that charge-
transfer reactions do occur. Furthermore, the formation of activated oxygen species 
via veratryl alcohol has been confirmed (Haemmerli et al. 1987, Shah et al. 1992). 
Lastly, veratryl alcohol functions as a substrate for H202 producing enzymes. Several 
basidiomycetes, including Trametes (Farmer et al. 1960), Pleurotus (Bourbonnais and 
Paice 1988, Guillen et al. 1992) and Bjerkandera (Muheim et al. 1990, de Jong et al. 
1992c) spp., produce aryl alcohol oxidase. The enzyme oxidizes aryl alcohols, 
including veratryl and anisyl alcohol, to the corresponding aldehydes with concomitant 
H2Oz formation. 
White-rot fungi of the genus Bjerkandera are interesting ligninolytic 
128 Physiological role of chlorinated aryl alcohols 
basidiomycetes because they posses high polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 
degrading activity (Field et al. 1992, Field et al. 1993). Bjerkandera spp. produce 
several extracellular ligninolytic enzymes. The production of three peroxidases, UP, 
MnP and manganese independent peroxidase (MIP) (Waldner ef a/. 1988, Kimura et 
al. 1990, de Jong et al. 1992a) and two H202-generating oxidases, aryl alcohol oxidase 
(AAO) (Muheim et al. 1990, de Jong et al. 1992c) and glyoxal oxidase (de Jong et al. 
1992c) have been reported. 
Bjerkandera spp. biosynthesize veratryl alcohol and veratraldehyde de novo 
from glucose together with anisaldehyde, 3-chloro-anisaldehyde and 3,5-dichloro-
anisaldehyde, and their respective aryl alcohols (de Jong et al. 1992b, de Jong et al. 
1993). In the present study, the physiological role of the chlorinated aromatics is 
examined. The time dependent production of the chlorinated aromatics and 
extracellular oxidative enzymes is followed. The reactions of the secondary metabolites 
with two ligninolytic enzymes, UP and AAO, are investigated and the proposed 
purposeful production of the chlorinated aromatics is discussed. 
METHODS 
Fungal culture and growth conditions. Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 was isolated from 
Dutch forest soil samples (de Jong et al. 1992c) and deposited in the collection of the 
Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS, Baarn, The Netherlands). The fungus 
was routinely grown statically at 30 ° C in a glucose/peptone medium as described by 
Kimura et al. (1990) or exceptionally in low nitrogen (glucose/Bill) medium (de Jong 
et al. 1992b). The time course of metabolite production and enzyme activity was 
measured in 30 ml loosely capped serum bottles containing 5 ml medium (de Jong et 
al. 1992b). Enzyme activity was analyzed in quadruplet, remaining culture fluid was 
combined and stored at -20 °C for FPLC analysis of extracellular proteins. Metabolite 
production was also analyzed in quadruplet from separate bottles at each time period 
since a sacrificed method was utilized for the extraction (de Jong et al. 1992b). For 
enzyme purification and washed cells experiments, 5 I erlenmeyers containing 500 ml 
medium were inoculated with Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 (Field et al. 1992, de Jong et al. 
1992a) and grown for 12-14 days. 
Enzyme assays. All enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically (Perkin-Elmer 
550AUV-Vis)at30°C. 
Lignin peroxidase (UP). A modified method of Tien and Kirk (1988) was used, the 
reaction mixture contained up to 500 /xl culture broth in 50 mM sodium tartrate pH 3.0 
129 Chapter 6 
and 2 mM veratryl alcohol (vacuum distilled) in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction 
was started with 0.4 mM H202 and the formation of veratraldehyde, (e310nm 9300 M"1 
cm"1) was monitored and corrected for aryl alcohol oxidase present. 
Manganese dependent peroxidase (MnP)/Manganese independent peroxidase (MIP). 
A combined assay was used to distinguish the enzymes. The oxidation of 2,6-
dimethoxyphenol (DMP) to an orange/brown dimer was used to measure laccase, 
MnP and MIP activity (e^^ 49.6 mM'1cm"1, Wariishi et al. 1992). Combined MIP/MnP 
activity: The reaction mixture contained 50 mM sodium malonate pH 4.5, 1 mM DMP, 
1 mM MnS04 and up to 600 jul culture broth in a total volume of 1 ml (de Jong et al. 
1992c). The reaction was started by the addition of 0.4 mM H202 and corrected for 
laccase activity present. MIP activity: The reaction mixture contained 50 mM sodium 
malonate, pH 4.5, 1 mM DMP, 1 mM EDTA and up to 600 /xl culture broth in a total 
volume of 1 ml (de Jong et al. 1992a). The reaction was started by the addition of 0.4 
mM H202 and corrected for laccase activity present. MnP activity is expressed as the 
combined MIP/MnP activity minus the MIP activity. 
Aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO). The oxidation of anisyl alcohol to anisaldehyde (e290nm 
15000 M"1cm'1, Muheim et al. 1990) was followed. The reaction mixture contained up 
to 200 /JI culture broth in 20 mM potassium phosphate (KPi) buffer, pH 5.7 and 1 mM 
anisyl alcohol in a total volume of 500 n\. 
Glyoxaloxidase. H202-producing activity of culture broth was determined by a modified 
method of Kersten and Kirk (1987). 500 ml 12-14 days-old extracellular fluid was 
washed (50 mM KPi, pH 6.0) and concentrated 10 fold by ultrafiltration (Amicon 
YM10). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM KPi, pH 6.0, 10 mM glyoxal, 0.01% 
phenol red, 10 ng horse-radish peroxidase (type II) (Sigma, St Louis, USA) and up to 
300 jil culture fluid in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction was stopped after 1h by 
adding 50 y\ 2N NaOH, and then the mixture was assayed for phenol red oxidation at 
610 nm against an appropriate blank. The H202-producing activity of culture broth was 
also assayed with other oxidase substrates including glyoxalate, glucose, xylose, 
galactose, cellobiose, anisyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, methanol, formaldehyde, oxalic 
acid, D,L-glycine, D,/_-alanine, D,L-glutamate and D,L-aspartate. 
Reduction of aldehydes by washed cells. Suspensions of 12-14 days-old cells (500 
ml) were harvested as described before (de Jong et al. 1990), washed with 50 mM KPi 
buffer, pH 6.0, concentrated 10 fold and resuspended in the same buffer. Aldehydes 
were added at 250 \J.M final concentration. Reaction mixture was incubated statically 
at 30 ° C. Samples (800 jul) taken at regular intervals were mixed with 200 MI 2 N HCI 
and analyzed by HPLC (de Jong et al. 1992b). Protein contents of whole cells were 
determined according to Bradford (1976). 
130 Physiological role of chlorinated aryl alcohols 
Enzyme purification. Time course of enzyme activity experiment: Frozen samples 
were thawed and washed with 10 mM KPi, pH 6.0. After washing, enzyme activity was 
measured and extracellular enzymes were analyzed at 405 nm by anion exchange 
chromatography using a FPLC system (Mono-Q HR 5/5, Pharmacia). The column was 
equilibrated with 10 mM KPi, pH 6.0. The enzyme was eluted with a linear salt gradient 
(0-300 mM KCI in starting buffer) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and 1 fraction/min during 
40 min. 
Purification of aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO) and lignin peroxidase (UP). Aryl alcohol 
oxidase and lignin peroxidase were purified according to a modified procedure 
described in literature (Muheim et al. 1990). After filtration and concentration of the 
enzyme on DEAE-sepharose CL6B (de Jong et al. 1992a), aryl alcohol oxidase and 
lignin peroxidase were separated from other peroxidases by Mono Q HR 5/5 (FPLC 
system, Pharmacia) anion exchange chromatography (0-300 mM NaCI in 50 mM KPi 
pH 6.0, 40 ml, 0.5 ml min"1). LiP and AAO eluted in the same fractions. More than 95% 
of both aryl alcohol oxidase and lignin peroxidase activity were retained after the anion 
exchange step. Gel filtration with Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (FPLC system, Pharmacia) 
(buffer 0.15 M NaCI in 50 mM KPi pH 6.0, 0.5 ml min'1) separated lignin peroxidase 
from aryl-alcohol oxidase. 
Synthesis of authentic compounds. 3-Chloro-anisyl alcohol (3-chloro-4-
methoxybenzyl alcohol) and 3-chloro-anisaldehyde (3-chloro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde) 
were synthesized as described before (de Jong et al. 1992b). The synthesis of 3,5-
Dichloro-anisyl alcohol (3,5-dichloro-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol) and 3,5-dichloro-
anisaldehyde (3,5-dichloro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde) are published elsewhere (de Jong 
et al. 1993). 
Instruments. Supernatant (50 nil) was routinely analyzed on a Hewlett Packard HPLC 
Chemstation (Pascal series) (Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a HP1050 pumping 
station, a HP1040 M series II diode array detector and a HP9000-300 data processor. 
The column (200 mm x 3 mm) filled with ChromSpher C18-PAH (5 ^m particles) was 
from Chrompack (Middelburg, The Netherlands). Aromatic metabolites were analyzed 
with the following gradient (0.4 ml/min, 30 °C): 90:10, 0:100 and 0:100 H20:CH3CN 
at 0, 15 and 20 minutes, respectively. The UV absorbance was monitored at 2 nm 
wavelength intervals from 210 to 350 nm. 
Chemicals. Mycological peptone was from Oxoid, (Basingstoke, UK). Veratryl alcohol 
(Janssen Chimica, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was vacuum distilled before use. All other 
chemicals were commercially available and used without further purification.

RESULTS 
Production of enzymes and secondary metabolites. It has been shown that white-
rot fungi of the genus Bjerkandera produce significant amounts of several aromatic 
compounds both in the laboratory and in the natural environment (de Jong et al. 
1992b, de Jong et al. 1993). In addition to the production of common fungal 
metabolites, veratryl alcohol and veratraldehyde, the de novo biosynthesis from 
glucose of anisaldehyde, 3-chloro-anisaldehyde and 3,5-dichloro-anisaldehyde, and 
their respective benzyl alcohols, has been reported. To investigate the physiological 
role of the chlorinated metabolites, the time-dependent production of ligninolytic 
enzymes and secondary metabolites was followed in order to confirm their concurrent 
occurrence. When grown on glucose/Bill medium Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 produces 
MnP, MIP and AAO (de Jong et al. 1992a, de Jong et al. 1992c), but no LiP activity 
is detectable. On a glucose/peptone medium all enzymes, including LiP, are produced

Figure 1 and 2A reveal that the production of secondary metabolites coincides with the

glucose/peptone medium compared to glucose/Bill medium was observed (Fig 2A 
and 2B). The increased level of veratryl alcohol coincides with the onset of LiP 
production (Figure 1 and 2A).

After 21 days, all enzymes had low activities (Figure 1). To analyze if the proteins were 
inactivated or had disappeared from the extracellular fluids, the protein profiles were 
measured. Figure 3 shows that extracellular protein levels decreased dramatically 
during the time-course. It is possible, there are still intracellular or cell bound 
ligninolytic enzymes present after 28 days incubation. To check this hypothesis 28 day 
old cultures were washed with 1 M NaCI or sonified. In both cases no significant 
increases in any of the enzyme activities was detected.

134 Physiological role of chlorinated aryl alcohols 
After the removal of low molecular weight compounds by ultrafiltration, LiP activity at 
day 4 was increased more than 50 times. This effect of LiP activity increased by the 
ultrafiltration step was only seen with the day 4 sample. However, it should be kept in 
mind that this inhibiting activity can easily lead to misjudgments about the presence 
of the LiP protein. To determine if LiP inhibition is caused by compounds already 
present in the growth medium or by newly produced metabolite(s), washed 
supernatant containing LiP was incubated with uninoculated sterile glucose/peptone 
medium and with the dialysate of 4-day-old culture broth after ultrafiltration. The sterile 
glucose/peptone medium strongly inhibited LiP activity indicating that compounds in 
the fresh glucose/peptone medium cause the inhibition. 
Substrate spectrum of aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO). Since the aryl aldehydes were 
produced together with AAO, the corresponding aryl alcohols were tested as 
substrates for this oxidase. To discriminate between peroxidase and aryl alcohol 
oxidase activity, the AAO enzyme was purified from glucose/peptone medium. It can 
be seen (Table 1) that all substituted anisyl alcohols are oxidized by AAO producing 
the corresponding aldehydes and H202. The Relative Activity/Km value was almost 300 
times higher for 3,5-dichloroanisyl alcohol compared to veratryl alcohol and 6.5 times 
higher for 3,5-dichloroanisyl alcohol compared to unsubstituted anisyl alcohol. Veratryl 
alcohol had the highest Km.

Reduction of aldehydes by whole cells. If aryl alcohols are indeed important for the 
extracellular H202 production, one would expect that the substituted anisyl aldehydes 
135 Chapter 6 
must be recycled by reduction to the corresponding alcohols. Whole cells of an 12 
day-old culture (500 ml) were washed with buffer and thereafter incubated with the four 
aldehydes. All the aldehydes were reduced with comparable rates ranging from 2.1 
nmol min"1 mg protein'1 for 3,5-dichloro-anisaldehyde to 1.1 nmol min"1 mg protein"1 
for 3-chloro-anisaldehyde. As an example the stoichiometric conversion of 3,5-dichloro-
anisaldehyde to 3,5-dichloro-anisyl alcohol is shown (Figure 4).

Other extracellular oxidases. To investigate if AAO is the only extracellular enzyme 
capable of H202-production, the washed extracellular fluid of a 12 day-old culture (500 
ml) was analyzed for other oxidases. With the coupled horseradish peroxidase/phenol 
red assay for H202 production, a positive result was found with the four sugars tested. 
Glucose was oxidized with a rate of 20 nmol min"1 ml sup"1. The activities with xylose, 
galactose and cellobiose (3.4, 0.6 and 0.2 nmol min'1 ml sup"1, respectively) were 
much lower. To compare glucose oxidase activity with AAO activity the 12 day-old 
extracellular fluid was also analyzed with the phenol red assay for anisyl alcohol 
oxidating activity. The fluid had an activity of 3.6 nmol min'1 ml sup"1. All the other 
substrates, including glyoxal, did not stimulate H202 production at all. 
Reactions of chlorinated anisyl alcohols with lignin peroxidase. The induction of 
LiP production only coincides with an increased veratryl alcohol production (Figure 1 
and 2A) and not with the (chloro) anisyl alcohols. However, it is still possible that, like 
136 Physiological role of chlorinated aryl alcohols 
veratryl alcohol, the chlorinated anisyl alcohols are also substrates for LiP. 
Furthermore, it is known that the oxidation of anisyl alcohol, a poor LiP substrate, is 
strongly increased by the addition of veratryl alcohol (Harvey et al. 1986, Valli et al. 
1990). In Table 2 the results are presented on the LiP catalyzed oxidation of the aryl 
alcohols in the absence and presence of veratryl alcohol. It can be concluded that LiP 
does not oxidize the chlorinated anisyl alcohols. Contrary to anisyl alcohol, the 
oxidation of these chlorinated anisyl alcohols is not stimulated by veratryl alcohol.

DISCUSSION 
This paper has shown that chlorinated anisyl metabolites are not just accidentally 
produced metabolites. Aside from their possible antimicrobial activity (Pfefferle et al. 
1990), they may also fulfil an important physiological function in the ligninolytic system 
of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55. 
All metabolites are produced simultaneously with the aryl alcohol oxidase and 
ligninolytic peroxidases. The dramatic decrease of all ligninolytic enzymes after 10 days 
137 Chapter 6 
incubation (Figures 1 and 3) is probably caused by proteolytic activity. This has also 
been described for lignin peroxidase in P. chrysosporium cultures (Dosoretz et al. 
1990a, 1990b, Cancel et al. 1993). Both chlorinated anisyl alcohols are, compared to 
veratryl alcohol, excellent substrates for the extracellular aryl alcohol oxidases (AAO). 
The addition of chlorine atoms to anisyl alcohol substantially increased the affinity of 
AAO for the alcohols. The AAO enzymes have also been found in cultures of T. 
versicolor (Farmer et al. 1960), Pleurotus sajor-caju (Bourbonnais and Paice 1988), P. 
ostreatus (Sannia et al. 1991), P. eryngii (Guillen et al. 1992) and B. adusta (Muheim 
et al. 1990). It is interesting to note that the AAO of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 has a 
much lower affinity for veratryl alcohol compared to AAOs of the Pleurotus spp. Thus 
veratryl alcohol is well protected against unwanted AAO-mediated oxidation and 
thereby is conserved for its function together with LiP in Bjerkandera spp. It has been 
reported that Pleurotus spp. do not produce LiP (Bourbonnais and Paice 1988, Sannia 
et al. 1990, Guillen et al. 1992) and consequently they do not need to conserve their 
veratryl alcohol levels. 
The experiments reported here demonstrate that LiP production by Bjerkandera 
sp. BOS55 is induced when grown on high nitrogen glucose/peptone medium similar 
to an earlier report with B. adusta (Kimura et al. 1990) but opposite to other white-rot 
fungi including the model fungus P. chrysosporium (Kirk and Farrell 1987). The 
correspondence in the appearance of LiP and veratryl alcohol may indicate that their 
production is regulated simultaneously. The relative amounts of veratryl alcohol and 
the chlorinated anisyl alcohols differ significantly depending on the growth conditions. 
We therefore conclude that the production of veratryl alcohol and the (chlorinated) 
anisyl metabolites are independently regulated. 
The chlorinated anisyl alcohols would not be useful for extracellular H202 
production if they are destroyed by the fungus's own agressive ligninolytic enzymes. 
Indeed, it was found that LiP can not oxidize anisyl alcohol derivatives after the 
addition of electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms. It is known that the addition of veratryl 
alcohol can increase the oxidation rate of anisyl alcohol (Harvey et al. 1986, Valli et al. 
1990). However, the oxidation rate of the chlorinated anisyl alcohols was not improved 
by the addition of veratryl alcohol. It is anticipated that MnP and other phenol 
oxidases, which have much lower oxidating capacity (Kersten et al. 1990, Popp and 
Kirk 1991), react even less with the chlorinated anisyl alcohols. We therefore conclude 
that the chlorinated anisyl metabolites are very well protected against an unwanted 
oxidation in the hostile ligninolytic environment and conserved for the intended use by 
AAO. The minor amounts of aldehyde formed from the chlorinated anisyl alcohols, 
both in the presence and absence of H202, is probably a reflection of a small 
contamination of the LiP enzyme with AAO. With a commercial LiP preparation from 
138 Physiological role of chlorinated aryl alcohols 
P. chrysosporium (Cultor, Kantvik, Finland), an organism which does not produce AAO 
and consequently AAO contamination is unlikely, no aldehyde formation was seen in 
the absence of H202 (unpublished results). 
If the aryl alcohols have a truly important physiological role, then the oxidized 
metabolites must be recycled. These aryl aldehydes must be reduced to again 
produce the alcohols with their metabolic function as UP and AAO substrates. It does 
not seem permissible to utilize energy for supplying each catalytic cycle with newly 
biosynthesized aryl alcohols. We demonstrated that all four aldehydes were reduced 
with comparable rates by washed cells. This indicates that an active H202 generating 
system is present. The relative amounts of each alcohol/aldehyde couple (Figure 1) 
reveals that during the first two weeks of growth intracellular dehydrogenase activity 
is the rate limiting step in this H202 production cycle. It is noteworthy that veratryl 
alcohol, which is the poorest AAO substrate, is always present in high concentrations 
in the glucose/peptone culture fluid thus capable of performing its other physiological 
functions as a LiP stabilizer and charge-transfer mediator. Reductive enzymes are 
common in basidiomycetes (Hurst 1963) and several aromatic acid and aldehyde 
reducing activities have been described in e.g. Trametes (syn. Polystictus) versicolor 
(Farmer et al. 1959) and Phlebia radiata (Lundell et al. 1990). Recently, an intracellular 
aryl alcohol dehydrogenase from P. chrysosporium was purified and characterized 
(Muheim et al. 1991). The enzyme reduced veratraldehyde to veratryl alcohol (2 nmol 
min"1 ml sup"1) using NADPH as a cofactor. Also anisaldehyde was substrate for this 
enzyme. 
White-rot fungi posses several systems for extracellular H202-generation (Kirk 
and Farrell 1987, Buswell 1992). It was also shown for Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, grown 
in glucose/peptone medium, that at least one other extracellular oxidase active on 
glucose and several other sugars was produced. Presently, it is not known which 
glucose oxidase was present. However, the fact that also xylose, galactose and 
cellobiose were substrates together with their relative activities indicates that the 
enzyme is a pyranose 2-oxidase (syn. glucose 2-oxidase) (Kelley and Reddy 1986, 
Vole and Eriksson 1988). Intracellular pyranose 2-oxidase has also been detected in 
T. versicolor (Machida and Nakanishi 1984) and P. chrysosporium (Vole and Eriksson 
1988). This enzyme has a rather low affinity (Km around 1 mM) for glucose (Machida 
and Nakanishi 1984). P. chrysosporium produces in addition to several intracellular 
oxidases (Buswell 1992), extracellular glyoxal oxidase (Kersten and Kirk 1987, Kersten 
1990) and excretes some pyranose 2-oxidase (Daniel et al. 1992). Substrates for 
glyoxal oxidase have Km's around 1 mM (Kersten 1990). Glyoxal oxidase has also 
been found in Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 grown on hemp stem wood (de Jong et al. 
1992c), however in glucose/peptone medium this enzyme was not detected.

We conclude that the chlorinated anisyl alcohols may have an important physiological 
function in the ligninolytic system of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55. The metabolites are 
produced simultaneously with the ligninolytic enzymes. In contrast to the four possible 
roles for veratryl alcohol in the ligninolytic system the chlorinated anisyl alcohols are 
only good substrates for extracellular aryl alcohol oxidase, generating H202 for the 
peroxidases. The formed aldehydes are readily recycled by reduction to the 
corresponding alcohols. The physiological function of CAM is outlined in Figure 5. The 
chlorine-substitution makes the aryl alcohols better substrates for AAO, while 
simultaneously strongly decreasing decay by the aggressive ligninolytic peroxidases. 
Although AAO are not the only enzymes available for the H202 generation, CAM may 
be important under the natural physiological conditions of wood degradation. AAO has 
an extremely high affinity for these chlorinated compounds compared to other non-
chlorinated substrates for the various extracellular fungal oxidases. We were able to 
detect high CAM concentrations in wood samples in the close vicinity of B. adusta and 
other white-rot fungi fruiting bodies (de Jong et al. 1993). Thus, chlorinated aromatic 
compounds can be purposeful for ecologically significant processes such as lignin 
degradation.

SUMMARY 
Common wood- and forest litter-degrading fungi produce chlorinated anisyl 
metabolites (CAM). These compounds, which are structurally related to xenobiotic 
chloroaromatics, occur at high concentrations of approximately 75 mg CAM kg'1 wood 
or litter in the environment. The ubiquity among common fungi to produce large 
amounts of chlorinated aromatic compounds in the environment makes us conclude 
that these kind of compounds can no longer be considered to originate mainly from 
anthropogenic sources.

INTRODUCTION 
Chlorinated aromatic compounds are largely considered as undesirable man-made 
pollutants. Adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) measurements are commonly used as 
a group parameter to monitor pollution in the environment. World-wide industries are 
required to comply with stringent environmental standards for chloroaromatic 
substances. However, industry is not necessarily the only source of these "xenobiotic" 
compounds. Recently, high AOX levels in pristine forest environments have been 
reported which greatly exceeds diffuse anthropogenic deposition (Asplund et al. 1991). 
Worldwide the AOX concentrations encountered ranged from 5-350 mg CI" kg'1 dry 
weight. A natural origin is plausible since several microorganisms are known to form 
cte novo up to 1500 different organohalogen metabolites (Siuda and DeBemardis 1973, 
Neidleman and Geigert 1986, Gribble 1992). Most wood- and forest litter-degrading 
fungi are basidiomycetes and several strains from many different genera have been 
reported to produce chlorinated aromatic compounds in the laboratory. Chlorinated 
anisyl metabolites (CAM) are biosynthesized by Lepista, Stropharia and Bjerkandera 
spp. (Thaller and Turner 1972, Pfefferle et al. 1990, de Jong et al. 1992a). Drosophilin 
A (tetrachloromethoxyphenol) and derivatives are produced by Psathyrella, Fomes, 
Mycena and Phellinus spp. (Anchel 1952, Singh and Rangaswami 1966, Hsu et al. 
1971, Butruille and Dominquez 1972, van Eijk 1975). Also the production of other 
chloroaromatics such as chloroanthraquinones by Dermocybe spp. (Gruber 1970), 
strobilurin B by Strobilurus spp. (Anke et al. 1984), mycenon by Mycena spp. (Hautzel 
et al. 1990) and 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate by Marasmius spp. (Turner and 
Aldridge 1983) have been reported. 
The objectives of this research were to estimate the ubiquity of CAM production 
among basidiomycetes, to analyze if high CAM concentrations are produced in the 
laboratory and to investigate if CAM production takes place and is detectable in the 
natural environment. The results presented in this paper will show for the first time that 
chlorinated aromatics are widely distributed at high concentrations in natural 
environments and are produced by many different genera.

Synthesis of authentic compounds. 3-Chloro-anisyl alcohol (3-chloro-4-
methoxybenzyl alcohol) and 3-chloro-anisaldehyde (3-chloro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde) 
were synthesized as described before (de Jong et al. 1992a). 
3,5-Dichloro-anisyl alcohol (3,5-dichloro-4-methoxy benzyl alcohol) was prepared 
from 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoic acid by treatment with dimethyl sulfate and 
151 Chapter 7 
subsequent reduction with lithium aluminium hydride. 
10 ml (105 mmol) of dimethyl sulfate and 13.8 g (100 mmol) of anhydrous 
potassium carbonate was added to a solution of 8.28 g (40 mmol) of 3,5-dichloro-4-
hydroxybenzoic acid in 200 ml of dry acetone. The reaction mixture was heated at 
reflux temperature for 3 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room 
temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered through Hyflo supercel, and the filter 
cake was washed with 200 ml of acetone. The solvent was evaporated under reduced 
pressure, and the resulting residue was dissolved in 250 ml of ether. The solution was 
washed successively with two 100-ml portions of 5% aqueous NaOH, one 50-ml 
portion of 10% aqueous Hcl, one 50-ml portion of saturated aqueous NaHC03, and 
one 50-ml portion of brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2S04 and 
evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was recrystallized from 
petroleum ether (bp 40-60 °C) to give 8.49 g (90 % yield) of methyl 3,5-dichloro-4-
methoxybenzoate as white needles, m.p. 82-83 °C (uncorrected). 1H-NMR (CDCI3) s 
(ppm): 3.84 (s, -OCH3); 3.88 (s, -OCH3); 7.86 (s, 2 aromatic protons). 13C-NMR 
(CDCI3) S (ppm): 52.43 (q); 60.67 (q); 127.01 (s); 129.37 (s); 130.04 (d); 155.90 (s); 
164.34 (s). MS, calculated for C9H803CI2 (M+) m/e 233.9850, found 233.9849. MS, 
m/e (%): 236 (27); 234 (44); 205 (65); 203 (100); 111 (21); 99 (19); 97 (45); 75 (18); 
74 (24); 62 (29); 61 (18). 
To a stirred suspension of 0.80 g (21 mmol) of LiAIH4 in 150 ml of dry ether was 
added dropwise a solution of 4.70 g (20 mmol) of methyl 3,5-dichloro-4-
methoxybenzoate in 50 ml of dry ether. When the addition was complete, the reaction 
mixture was allowed to stir for 1 h at room temperature. The excess LiAIH4 was then 
quenched by the careful addition of a few drops of saturated aqueous Na2S04. The 
mixture was dried over anhydrous Na2S04 and filtered through Hyflo supercel. After 
washing the filter cake with 100 ml of ether, the solvent was evaporated under reduced 
pressure. The resulting product was flash chromatographed on Merck silica gel 60 
(230-400 mesh) (5:1 petroleum ether (bp 40-60 °C)/EtOAc) to give 3.69 g (89 % yield) 
of 3,5-dichloro-anisyl alcohol as a white solid, m.p. 46-47 °C (uncorrected). 1H-NMR 
(CDCI3) S (ppm): 2.98 (br s, -OH); 3.82 (s, -OCH3); 4.50 (s, -CH20-); 7.18 (s, 2

205.9901. 
3,5-Dichloro-anisaldehyde(3,5-dichloro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde)was prepared 
from 3,5-dichloro-anisyl alcohol by oxidation with barium manganate in dry 
dichloromethane (Firouzabadi and Ghaderi 1978) in 69 % yield, m.p. 63-65 °C (from 
petroleum ether (bp 40-60 °C); uncorrected). 1H-NMR (CDCI3) <s (ppm): 3.93 (s, -

(q), 129.76 (d), 130.35 (s), 132.84 (s), 156.97 (s), 188.41 (d). MS, calculated for 
C8H602CI2 (M+) m/e 203.9745, found 203.9743. 
Production of chlorinated anisyl metabolites in the laboratory. Fungal production 
of extracellular CAM was tested with an amino acid medium containing per litre: 
KH2P04 0.2 g, MgS04 0.5 g, glucose 10 g, casamino acids 1 g, tyrosine 1 g, 
phenylalanine 1 g and yeast extract 1 g. All positive strains were also tested for CAM 
production with a synthetic (glucose/Bill) low nitrogen medium (de Jong et al. 1992a). 
Chlorinated metabolites were extracted from the cultures with acetonitrile or 
dichloromethane and were separated by GC or HPLC (de Jong et al. 1992a). 
Identifications were based on matching retention times and mass spectra with the 
chemically synthesized pure compounds. 
Production of chlorinated anisyl metabolites in the environment. Sites were 
sampled between October 28 and December 4, 1992, in The Netherlands (Oranje 
Nassau Oord and Boswachterij Oostereng both near Renkum, Hoekelumse Bos near 
Ede, Kaapse Bossen near Doom, Amelisweerd near Utrecht, Noordhoutse Bos near 
Maarn, Wageningen and Elspeterbosch near Elspeet), Poland (nearby Gorki within 
Kampinosky National Park, nearby Palmiry Cementary and Bialowieska forest sectors 
390-393) and Belgium (nearby Eupen within the Haute Fagne National Forest). 
Composite random samples of rotting wood or moldy leaf-litter were taken in 
all sampling sites. Environmental samples adjacent to fruiting bodies of CAM-producing 
fungi grown on gymnosperm (pine and spruce) and angiosperm (beech, birch, oak, 
elm, ash and hornbeam) wood or litter were also analyzed for CAM production. 
Routinely samples were extracted with dichloromethane and analyzed with GC/MS, 
but in a few cases samples were extracted with acetonitrile and analyzed by HPLC. 
Instruments. Supernatant (50 /xl) was routinely analyzed on a Hewlett Packard HPLC 
Chemstation (Pascal series) (Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a HP1050 pumping 
station, a HP1040 M series II diode array detector and a HP9000-300 data processor. 
The column (200 mm x 3 mm) filled with ChromSpher C18-PAH (5 f»m particles) was 
from Chrompack (Middelburg, The Netherlands). Aromatic metabolites were analyzed 
with the following gradient (0.4 ml min"1, 30 °C): 90:10, 0:100 and 0:100 H20:CH3CN 
at 0, 15 and 20 minutes, respectively. The UV absorbance was monitored at 2 nm 
wavelength intervals from 210 to 350 nm. 3,5-Dichloro-anisaldehyde was purified using 
a preparative Lichrosorb diol column (250* 10mm) in two steps. 1) CH2CI2 (10%) / 
pentane (90%) to 100% CH2CI2 for 40 min. 2) CH2CI2 (20%) / pentane (80%) to 50% 
CH2CI2 for 40 min. In both cases flow rate was 3ml min"1, UV detection at 214 nm. 1.1 
153 Chapter 7 
mg of white thin crystals were isolated. 
Mass spectra were measured with a Hewlett Packard HP5890 GC with 30 m DB17 
column and a HP5970 MSD. Injection temperature was 200 °C. The starting 
temperature of the column was 80°C, gradient 7°C min"\ final temperature 240°C. 
Helium was used as carrier gas (20 ml min'1). 
1H-NMR, 13C-NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AC-E200 spectrometer 
(Rheinstetten-Forchheim, Germany). Authentic and synthesized compounds were 
dissolved in CDCI3. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal standard. 
Chemicals. 3-Chloro-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-chloro-4-methoxybenzoic acid and 3,5-
dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoic acid were purchased from Heraeus (Karlsruhe, Germany). 
Veratryl alcohol, veratraldehyde, anisyl alcohol (4-methoxybenzyl alcohol) and 
anisaldehyde (4-methoxybenzaldehyde) were from Janssen Chimica (Tilburg, The 
Netherlands). Barium manganate was obtained from Aldrich (Bornem, Belgium). 
RESULTS 
Recently, we have shown that white-rot fungi of the genus Bjerkandera produce 3-
chloro-anisyl alcohol (I) and 3-chloro-anisaldehyde (II) when grown in a glucose 
medium (de JOng et al. 1992a). In addition to the monochlorinated metabolites, 
Bjerkandera spp. also produce 3,5-dichloro-anisyl alcohol (III) and 3,5-dichloro-
anisaldehyde (IV) (Figure 1).

The mass spectra of the dichlorinated compounds are shown in Figure 2. Anisyl 
alcohol and anisaldehyde, which are the nonchlorinated counterparts of CAM, were 
only produced in trace amounts by this fungus (de Jong et al. 1992a). 
The culture conditions of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 were altered in an attempt to 
enhance the CAM production. The medium composition, low nitrogen (glucose/Bill) 
versus amino acid medium, had only a minor effect on the CAM levels. Also the 
addition of 0.5 mM anisyl alcohol or 0.5 mM anisaldehyde at the beginning of CAM 
production (day 4) did not stimulate the production of CAM compounds. The 
production of CAM compounds was also not significantly influenced by a variable CI" 
concentration ranging from 0.4 to 20 mM.

CAM production was measured with fungi grown on low nitrogen (glucose/Bill) medium and 
on amino acid medium. T. versicolor only produced CAM when grown on the amino acid 
medium, all other fungi produced CAM on both media. Basidiomycetous fungi tested for CAM 
production and the analysis procedure are described in the materials and methods section.

156 Significant amounts of chlorinated aromatics in the environment 
In an extensive screening program, we now have checked 60 basidiomycetous fungi 
for the production of mono- and dichlorinated anisyl metabolites (CAM) (Table 1). CAM 
were produced by 15 strains and concentrations were detected up to 37 mg I"1, Table 
1 lists 9 organisms which were taxonomically determined. Several other fungi, including 
D. confragosa, F. fomentarius and /. benzoinum produced small amounts (< 0.8 mg 
I"1) of 3-chloro-anisaldehyde only when grown on the amino acid medium. Important 
examples of fungi that did not produce GC/MS detectable amounts of CAM included: 
G. applanatum, G. trabeum, L. edodes, P. chrysosporium, P. igniarius var. trivialis, P. 
radiata and P. ostreatus. This number of positive strains can be a conservative 
estimate since the amount and spectrum of aromatic compound biosynthesis is very 
much dependent on the growth medium and the strain used (Gallois et al. 1990). 
These findings confirm and extend two earlier reports in which basidiomycetes (Lepista 
diemmii and Stropharia sp.) were shown to produce CAM (Thaller and Turner 1972, 
Pfefferle et al. 1990).

The production of chlorinated aromatic metabolites (CAM) could be an artefact of 
culture conditions or it could be a purposeful event. The challenging question to be 
addressed here was if significant production of CAM also occurs in natural 
157 Chapter 7 
environments. Therfore, we tested to determine if the production of CAM occurs when 
a CAM-producing basidiomycete is grown on autoclaved lignocellulosic substrates 
common to forest litter. Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 was grown on European beech 
(Fagus sylvatica), European white birch (Betula verrucosa), Norway spruce {Picea 
abies) and hemp stem wood (Cannabis sativa) in demineralized water all at 30 g I"1, 
and after 30 days of incubation, significant CAM production was evident on all of these 
substrates. The total CAM concentration ranged from 12 to 61 mg kg"1 dry weight 
woody material. 
If fungal biosynthesis of CAM is a widespread process in nature, then it should 
be possible to encounter such compounds in the environment. Composite random 
samples of moldy litter (leaves, twigs, branches and nut husks) and rotting logs were 
sampled at several natural forested sites. At all sites CAM were detectable and were 
identified based on matching retention times and mass spectra (Table 2). CAM were 
not present in control samples such as fresh forest litter or intact wood. Rotting wood 
or leaf-litter adjacent to the fruiting bodies of CAM producing basidiomycetes 
consistently contained CAM concentrations high enough to be considered as 
hazardous wastes according to Dutch environmental regulations on their 
nonmethylated counterparts, chlorophenols, in soils (> 10 mg kg'1) (Stoop and Rennen 
1990). We have also examined fruiting bodies of the edible mushroom L. nuda for 
CAM levels. It contained 0.8 mg CAM kg'1 dry weight mushroom. No CAM was found 
in the oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus). 
DISCUSSION 
In this study, we found that common wood- and forest litter-degrading fungi produce 
high concentrations of chlorinated anisyl metabolites (CAM) both in the laboratory and 
in the natural environment. Many of the CAM producers (B. adusta, Hypholoma spp., 
L nuda, P. squarrosa and S. aeruginosa) are widespread in nature (Phillips 1981, 
Krieglsteiner 1991), and consequently a ubiquitous production of CAM under natural 
conditions is to be inferred. Future research should determine if other fungal 
chlorinated aromatic metabolites, e.g. drosophilins (Anchel 1952, Singh and 
Rangaswami 1966, Hsu et al. 1971, Butruille and Dominquez 1972, van Eijk 1975), are 
also present at high concentrations in the environment. 
Fungal chlorinated aromatic compounds have antibiotic properties (Anchel 
1952, Pfefferle et al. 1990, Gribble 1992). In the accompanying article (de Jong et al. 
1993), we have shown that CAM alcohols have another physiological role because 
they are excellent substrates for extracellular aryl alcohol oxidase, generating 
158 Significant amounts of chlorinated aromatics in the environment 
extracellular H202 for the lignin-degrading peroxidases. All CAM producers tested 
secreted peroxidases and the majority of the strains also produced aryl-alcohol 
oxidase (Table 1). Future research should elucidate if CAM alcohols are also in vivo 
important as aryl-alcohol oxidase substrates for the other CAM producing strains. 
The high fungal production of chlorinated aromatic compounds in natural 
environments should be compared with the industrial sources of analogous priority 
pollutants. The results will possibly provide a basis for re-evaluating the strict 
environmental standards for chloroaromatics in relation to background levels in natural 
environments. A number of possible environmental fates are outlined in Figure 3. Since 
the environmental scope of natural "xenobiotic" production seems to be much greater 
than previously thought, it is important to consider the ultimate fate of CAM released 
into the soil environment. Although it has been demonstrated that ligninolytic 
basidiomycetes are able to mineralize chlorophenol compounds (Mileski et al. 1988, 
Valli and Gold 1991, Joshi and Gold 1993) with peroxidases and laccases causing the 
initial dechlorinations (Hammel and Tardone 1988, Roy-Arcand and Archibald 1991), 
we have demonstrated in the companion article that CAM compounds are resistant to 
ligninolytic attack (de Jong et al. 1993). However, many other microorganisms and 
microbial consortia are known which are responsible for the complete mineralization 
of a wide variety of chlorinated aromatic pollutants (Haggblom 1992). Thus part of the 
CAM may be fully mineralized but another part may become incorporated into humus 
according to known biotransformations. Partial metabolism of CAM at the methoxy 
(Nielson et al. 1988, Bernhardt et al. 1988, Brezny et al. 1992) and alcohol/aldehyde 
(Nielson et al. 1988, Zhang and Wiegel 1992) groups as well as hydroxylation 
reactions (Crawford et al. 1973) will yield, among others, 2-chlorophenol and 3-
chlorocatechol, which in turn are readily copolymerized into humus with phenol 
oxidizing enzymes as demonstrated both in vitro (Bollag et al. 1977, Maloney et al. 
1986, Claus and Filip 1990, Dec and Bollag 1990, Roy-Arcand and Archibald 1991) 
and during soil microcosm studies (Cheng et al. 1983). The resulting chlorohumus 
polymers are non-toxic (Lyr 1962, Bollag et al. 1988) and poorly biodegraded when 
incubated in soils (Dec and Bollag 1988). Consequently, CAM should be considered 
as possible building blocks for the environmentally highly persistent adsorbable 
organic halogens polymers (AOX) present at high concentrations in pristine forest 
environments (Asplund and Grimvall 1991). 
Recently, the chlorinated aromatic structures in high molecular weight organic 
materials from unpolluted surface waters and groundwaters have been characterized 
(Dahlman et al. 1993, Dahlman et al. 1994). Degradation products originating from 3-
chloro- and 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl units dominated in samples of unpolluted 
environments, while bleach kraft mill effluents were most abundant in chlorinated 
159 Chapter 7 
guaiacyl and syringyl units. These results seem to address chlorinated anisyl 
metabolites as a potential major source for natural, high molecular weight AOX. 
Aside from the above described detoxification reactions, the proposed 
chlorophenol intermediates can also give rise to biotoxification reactions. It has been 
demonstrated in vitro experiments that peroxidase-mediated oxidation of chlorophenols 
results in the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (Figure 
3) (Maloney et al. 1986, Svenson et al. 1989, Oberg et al. 1990). Recently, also the 
production of dioxins during waste-water treatments and composting has been 
reported (Oberg et al. 1993). 
We conclude that CAM-production is a very common capacity among wood-
and forest litter-degrading fungi. A detailed analysis of subsequent transformation 
processes of chloroaromatics in different ecosystems is very important to elucidate the 
relative importance of different environmental fates such as complete mineralization to 
carbon dioxide, detoxification processes leading to chlorohumus and biotoxification 
processes generating natural hazardous compounds, including polychlorinated dioxins 
and dibenzofurans.

DEGRADATION OF VERATRYL ALCOHOL BY

and Jan A.M. de Bont 
SUMMARY 
Several bacteria, yeasts and fungi selectively isolated from paper mill waste water grew 
on veratryl alcohol, a key intermediate of lignin metabolism. Penicillium simplicissimum 
oxidized veratryl alcohol via a NAD(P)+-dependent veratryl alcohol dehydrogenase to 
veratraldehyde which was further oxidized to veratric acid in a NAD(P)+-dependent 
reaction. Veratric acid-grown cells contained NAD(P)H-dependent O-demethylase 
activity for veratrate, vanillate and isovanillate. Protocatechuate was cleaved by a 
protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase.

INTRODUCTION 
Lignin is by far the most abundant aromatic substance present in the biosphere. It is 
a polymer composed of phenylpropanoid units linked through a variety of C-C and C-
O-C bonds. Fungi have long been known to metabolize lignin, but the mode of action 
of these organisms on this difficult to degrade substrate remained obscure for a long 
time. A breakthrough in the field of lignin biodegradation research occurred in 1983 
when extracellular peroxidases were discovered in ligninolytic cultures of 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Tien and Kirk 1983, Glenn et al. 1983). These 
ligninases cause a one-electron oxidation of lignin model compounds via radical cation 
intermediates, providing a unifying explanation for most of the reactions observed in 
lignin biodegradation (Schoemaker et al. 1985). However, ligninases alone do not 
seem to be able to degrade lignin in vivo, which indicates that other enzymes are 
involved in the lignin modification process (Kirk and Farrell 1987). 
Veratryl alcohol is a key compound in lignin biodegradation by Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium with several distinct functions. It has possibly an important physiological 
role in the redox cycle of the lignin peroxidase in converting the oxidized lignin 
peroxidase to native enzym, it acts as a one-electron transfer mediator between the 
enzyme and the insoluble polymeric lignin, and it induces the ligninolytic system of P. 
chrysosporium. Veratryl alcohol is also a substrate for the enzyme. The main product 
is veratraldehyde, but in an oxygen atmosphere also ring cleavage and 
oxidation/hydroxylation of the aromatic ring occur (Haemmerli et al. 1987, Schmidt et 
al. 1989, Schoemaker and Leisola 1990). Interestingly, the fungus only grows at the 
expense of veratryl alcohol or other aromatic compounds when a co-substrate as for 
instance glucose or cellulose is available. 
Our interest in the metabolism of lignin and lignin monomers by fungi originates 
from environmental problems caused by traditional pulping processes. Because 
veratryl alcohol is an important compound in lignin degradation, it was decided to 
study organisms and their enzymes and pathways involved in the catabolism of this 
aromatic compound. Since Phanerochaete chrysosporium does not grow on veratryl 
alcohol in the absence of co-substrates, several other micro-organisms were isolated 
that use aromatic compounds as sole source of carbon and energy. In this paper we 
describe the metabolism of veratryl alcohol by the fungus Penicillium simplicissimum. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Organism and media. Penicillium simplicissimum was isolated from paper mill waste 
168 Degradation of veratryl alcohol 
water. The enrichment mineral salts medium contained in 1 I of deionized water: 
KH2P04> 1.8 g; Na2HP04, 1.0 g; NH4CI, 2.0 g; (NH4)2S04, 0.1 g; MgCI2.6H20, 0.075g 
and 0.2 ml of a trace elements solution as described by Vishniac and Santer (1957), 
carbon sources were added at 0.1% (w/v). Incubations were at pH 5.0 and 30 °C. 
Details of the isolation and characterization are given under Results. The isolate, 
deposited at (CBS), Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures Baarn, The Netherlands, 
as CBS 170.90, was maintained on slant agar of 5 g I'1 glucose and 3.5 g I'1 yeast 
extract medium to which 15 g I"1 Oxoid (Basingstoke, UK) no. 3 agar had been added. 
It was routinely grown in a mineral salts medium identical to the enrichment medium 
except that 4.57 g I'1 polyacrylic acid (PAA, 63% w/v, Mw 2000) was added. The 
medium was adjusted to pH 5.2 with NaOH. Unless stated otherwise the carbon 
sources were added to this mineral medium at 2.0 g I"1. 
Culture conditions. Cells were routinely grown fed batch at 30° C in a flat bottomed 
round flask (2 litre). Aeration was by stirring (600 rpm) with a 5 cm long magnetic 
stirrer. The flow of the substrate (0.2% (w/v) veratryl alcohol in mineral salts medium) 
was 24 ml hour'1 and air (5 ml min'1) was bubbled continuously through the medium. 
Cells were harvested daily by withdrawing half (approximately 575 ml) of the culture. 
Substrate specificity experiments. The substrate specificity of CBS 170.90 for 
various aromatic compounds as sole source of carbon and energy was tested in 100 
ml serum bottles closed with screw-caps. To 10 ml of the mineral medium various 
carbon sources (0.1 % (w/v)) were added and CCyproduction was measured after 
1 month of incubation. Inoculated bottles containing mineral medium without added 
carbon source served as blanks. Whenever the C02-concentration in a bottle was 
more than 5 times the concentration in the blank it was concluded that growth had 
occurred. For concentrations between the blank and five times the blank it was 
concluded that no growth had occurred. When no C02-production at all occurred it 
was concluded that the substrate was toxic for the organism at 0.1 % (w/v). In those 
cases experiments were repeated at 0.01% (w/v) substrate concentrations and 
moreover in a second approach a two phase system was used (Rezessy-Szabo et al. 
1987) to reduce the concentration of carbon source in the water phase. In the latter 
case dibutylphthalate (2 ml) was included as a second phase bringing the total volume 
to 12 ml. Growth was determined as described above. 
Suspensions of washed cells and cell-free extracts. Cells were harvested from the 
growth medium by filtration over a cheese-cloth, washed with buffer (KH2P04, 1.8 g; 
Na2HP04, 1.0 g; PAA, 4.57 g) pH 5.2 and resuspended in the same buffer. For the 
169 Chapter 8 
preparation of cell-free extracts, the cells were washed with potassium phosphate 
buffer pH 7.2 (50 mM) and disrupted by X-press (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) 
disintegration at -25 ° C. After slowly thawing, the resulting homogenate was centrifuged 
at 48000 g for 20 min at4°C. The supernatant containing 10-20 (mg protein) ml"1 was 
the crude cell-free extract. A cofactor-free extract was obtained by dialyzing the cell-
free extract against a 50 mM potassium phosphate solution (pH 7.0) for 12 hours at 
4°C. 
Analytical methods. Protein contents of whole cells and cell-free extracts were 
determined by the method of Bradford (1976) using crystalline bovine serum albumin 
as a standard. C02-production was measured on a Packard 427 (Delft, The 
Netherlands) gaschromatograph with a Porapak Q (Chrompack, Middelburg, The 
Netherlands) column. Spectrophotometric assays were done with a Perkin-Elmer 
(Norwalk, USA) 550A UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 30 °C. Reverse-phase HPLC 
analysis were performed at room temperature on a ABI Analytical (Kratos division, 
Foster City, USA) isocratic HPLC system with a ChromSpher C-18 column (200 by 3 
mm, Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands). The eluent was a mixture of 
methanol, Milli-Q H20 and acetic acid (33:66:1). With an eluent mixture of methanol, 
Milli-Q H20 and acetic acid (15:85:1) vanillic acid and isovanillic acid could be separa­
ted using the same column as above. 
Enzyme assays. Veratryl alcohol dehydrogenases: The activity of a NAD(P)+-
dependent alcohol dehydrogenase was assayed spectrophotometrically by following 
at 340 nm the rate of reduction of NAD+ and NADP+ in dialyzed cell-free extract in the 
presence of veratryl alcohol. The reaction mixture (total volume 2.25 ml) contained cell-
free extract, 0.5 /umol NAD+ or NADP+ and 100 /umol Glycine buffer pH 10.0. The 
reaction was started by adding 0.5 MTIOI veratryl alcohol. 
PMS-(Phenazine methosulfate)-dependent veratryl alcohol dehydrogenase was 
assayed by measuring by means of HPLC the rate of disappearance of veratryl 
alcohol. The reaction mixture (total volume 5.0 ml) contained dialyzed cell-free extract, 
1.0 /Limol PMS, 77.0 ^mol NH4CI and 200 Mmol Glycine buffer pH 10.0. The reaction 
was started by the addition of 2.5 /umol veratryl alcohol. Samples (0.5 ml), taken at 
intervals, were mixed with 0.5 ml 2N HCI. The protein free solution was separated and 
analyzed as described above. Metabolites were identified by comparison of retention 
times with authentic samples and in situ scanning of the UV spectra after the flow had 
been stopped. 
Aryl (Veratryl) alcohol oxidase was measured according to Bourbonnais and Paice 
(1988) and lignin peroxidase was assayed for according to Tien and Kirk (1988). 
170 Degradation of veratryl alcohol 
Veratraldehyde dehydrogenase: The enzyme was assayed by measuring by means of 
HPLC the rate of formation of veratric acid. The reaction mixture (total volume 5.0 ml) 
contained dialyzed cell-free extract; 2.5 >j.mo\ NAD+ or NADP+ and 150 Atmol Glycine 
buffer pH 10.0. The reaction was started by the addition of 1.25 Mmol veratraldehyde. 
Samples (0.5 ml), taken at intervals, were separated and analyzed as described above. 
Veratric acid O-demethylase: The enzyme was assayed with HPLC by measuring the 
rate of decrease of veratric acid. The reaction mixture (Total volume 1.5 ml) contained 
cell-free extract (600 MO; 1-5 nmol NADPH and 36 /xmol potassium phosphate pH 7.2. 
The reaction was started by adding 0.15 ^mol veratrate. Samples (0.2 ml), taken at 
intervals, were mixed with 0.2 ml 2N HCI and then diluted with 0.2 ml H20. Samples 
were separated and analyzed as described above. 
Oxidative decarboxylase was measured according to Buswell et al. (1979), 
nonoxidative decarboxylase was measured according to Kuwahara et al. (1981). 
Dioxygenases: All activities were assayed for with dialyzed cell-free extracts containing 
2 mM (NH4)2Fe(S04)2. Protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3). The activity 
of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was measured spectrophotometrically at 290 nm 
(Fujisawa and Hayaishi 1968). Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.1). The 
involvement of a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was investigated spectrophotometrically at 
260 nm as described by Nakazawa and Nakazawa (1970). Gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase 
(EC 1.13.11.4). Activity of the enzyme was measured spectrophotometrically as 
described by Crawford et al. (1975). Extradiol cleavage of protocatechuate (EC 
1.13.11.8) and catechol (EC 1.13.11.2) were investigated spectrophotometrically at 410 
nm (Dagley et al. 1960) and 375 nm (Nakazawa and Nakazawa 1970) respectively. 
Chemicals. The biochemicals were from Boehringer, Mannheim, FRG. All the other 
chemicals were of commercially available analytical grade and were used without 
further purification. 
RESULTS 
Isolation of aromatic compounds degrading micro-organisms. Micro-organisms 
were isolated using as inoculum activated sludge from a waste water purification plant 
of a thermomechanical pulping paper mill. Particular rapid growth occurred with 3,4-
dimethoxycinnamic acid as sole source of carbon and energy and 4 yeast and 4 fungi 
were isolated on this compound. These organisms also grew on veratryl alcohol. 
Bacteria were also routinely isolated but these organisms were not further examined. 
A fungus designated PAZ1 had the shortest doubling time on veratryl alcohol and 
171 Chapter 8 
furthermore grew on many other aromatic compounds. This organism was used for 
further studies. 
Characterization of strain PAZ1 = CBS 170.90. CBS 170.90 was identified by the 
CBS as Penicillium simplicissimum. The morphology of the isolate accommodate it in 
the P. simplicissimum-comp\ex. Chemical analysis of the secondary metabolites of the 
fungus supported the outcome of the accommodation, although it has also 
resemblance to P. cremeogrisum.

CBS 170.90 grows on various aromatic compounds as sole source of carbon and 
energy (Table 1). Growth was routinely assessed at 0.1% (w/v) substrate concen­
trations resulting in several instances in false negative results due to toxicity of the 
substrates as demonstrated by measuring C02 production in the presence and 
172 Degradation of veratryl alcohol 
absence of substrate. In these cases a lower substrate concentration of 0.01% (w/v) 
was used. Alternatively dibutylphthalate was used as a second liquid phase (see 
materials and methods section) since this water-immiscible solvent was neither toxic 
to the fungus nor degraded by the fungus. Using these techniques additional 
compounds were identified as growth substrate (Table 1). 
The doubling time of the fungus with veratryl alcohol as growth substrate was 
10 hours and the growth rate constant for growth on Czapek-Malt agar was 165 nm 
hour"1. The optimum pH for growth on veratryl alcohol was between pH 5.0 and pH 
5.5; during fed batch cultivation the pH stays in this range. 
Fed batch cultivation of the fungus in flat bottomed round flasks with magnetic 
stirring gave no pellet formation as contrasted with batch cultivation in agitated 5 I 
erlenmeyer flasks. Therefore a better reproducibility of enzyme activity in fed batch 
cultivated cell-free extracts was achieved. Attempts to grow the fungus in a CSTR 
(Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor) were unsuccesful. 
Oxidation and accumulation of metabolites by whole cells. P. simplicissimum CBS 
170.90, when grown batch-wise on veratryl alcohol, excreted both veratraldehyde and 
veratric acid in the medium. The organism accumulated vanillic acid when grown fed 
batch on veratric acid in the flat bottomed round flask. The red color of the growth 
medium observed correlated to the vanillic acid concentration. This color was never 
observed while growing the fungus on veratryl alcohol or succinate. 
Incubation of veratryl alcohol-grown washed cells with veratryl alcohol resulted 
in the transient accumulation of veratric acid and vanillic acid (Figure 1a) while no 
veratraldehyde was detected. Incubation of these washed cells with veratraldehyde 
resulted in a quick transient accumulation of both veratryl alcohol and veratric acid, 
with vanillic acid accumulating to a lesser extent (Figure 1b). From veratric acid these 
cells transiently accumulated vanillic acid (Figure 1c). In a subsequent experiment, 
both veratryl alcohol and veratric acid grown washed cells were incubated with veratric 
acid, with vanillic acid and with isovanillic acid. Both types of washed cells metabolized 
isovanillic acid faster than either vanillic acid or veratric acid (16, 5 and 7 nmol min'1 
(mg protein)"1 by veratryl alcohol-grown cells and 75, 49 and 49 nmol min"1 (mg 
protein)'1 by veratric acid-grown cells respectively). 
Enzyme activities in crude cell-free extracts. From the above results, veratryl 
alcohol metabolism by P. simplicissimum CBS 170.90 was anticipated to proceed via 
veratraldehyde and veratric acid. In dialyzed cell-free extracts a NAD+-dependent 
veratryl alcohol dehydrogenase activity was detected (Table 2). Activity with NADP+ 
was slightly lower than with NAD+. A trace of a PMS-dependent veratryl alcohol

174 Degradation of veratryl alcohol 
dehydrogenase was also observed. The PMS-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase 
activity was stimulated by the addition of NH4+-ions. The products of both the NAD+-
and PMS-dependent veratryl alcohol transformation were identified as veratraldehyde 
by using the authentic compound for comparison of HPLC retention times and 
absorption spectra. Neither veratryl alcohol oxidase activity nor lignin peroxidase 
activity could be demonstrated in concentrated supernatant or in cell-free extracts of 
veratryl alcohol grown cells. It was also possible to detect a NAD(P)+-dependent 
veratraldehyde dehydrogenase, but no PMS-dependent activity for the aldehyde was 
observed in dialyzed cell-free extracts. The pH optima of the two alcohol dehydroge­
nases and the aldehyde dehydrogenase were around pH 10. 
A low but distinct O-demethylase activity for veratric acid was observed 
whenever extracts were prepared from veratric acid grown cells (Table 2). 
Demethoxylation of veratric acid was dependent on the presence of molecular oxygen 
and NAD(P)H as electron donor. The cell-free extracts from veratric acid grown cells 
also showed demethylase activity for vanillic and isovanillic acid (Table 2) but not for 
veratryl alcohol or veratraldehyde. Unfortunately, no O-demethylase activity was 
detected in cells grown on veratryl alcohol, although various techniques for cell 
disrupture and various incubation conditions were examined. Neither an oxidative 
decarboxylase nor a nonoxidative decarboxylase activity acting on the three different 
acids was detected in extracts of both veratryl alcohol and veratric acid grown cells.

Protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase activity was induced after growth of CBS 170.90 on 
both veratryl alcohol and veratric acid (Table 2). Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was also 
detected in cell-free extracts, but no significant induction of the enzyme was observed 
when the fungus was grown on veratryl alcohol or veratric acid. Upon dialysis, addition 
of (NH4)2Fe(S04)2 restored full activity of both protocatechuate and catechol 
dioxygenase. Neither gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity nor extra diol cleavage of 
either catechol or protocatechuate was detected in any of the cell-free extracts. 
DISCUSSION 
Veratryl alcohol, a natural occurring aromatic compound, was readily degraded by 
several bacteria, yeasts and fungi. The here described fungus Penicillium simplicis-
simum CBS 170.90 used various aromatic compounds as sole source of carbon and 
energy (Table 1). This fungus has a rather broad substrate specificity when compared 
with Penicillium spinulosum P6 (Cain et al. 1968) or Aureobasidium pullulans 
(Bourbonnais and Paice 1987). In the case of both P. spinulosum P6 and A. pullulans 
substrate toxicity cannot be neglected. Oxidation and reduction patterns for aromatic 
alcohols and aldehydes by A. pullulans grown on rich medium without aromatic 
carbon sources are very similar to the picture obtained for CBS 170.90 grown on 
veratryl alcohol (Figure 1). Also non-induced cells of Methylosinus trichosporium 
oxidize immediately several aromatic alcohols including veratryl alcohol (Mountfort et 
al. 1990). 
CBS 170.90 oxidized veratryl alcohol via veratraldehyde to veratrate with a 
NAD(P)+-dependent enzyme. The very low activity of a PMS-dependent veratryl alcohol 
dehydrogenase is probably a reflection of a non-specific alcohol dehydrogenase 
activity. Alternative ways for the oxidation of veratryl alcohol via for instance an oxidase 
(Bourbonnais and Paice 1988) or a peroxidase (Tien and Kirk 1988) were not 
detected. 
Veratric acid is demethylated to form protocatechuate. It is known from literature 
(Ribbons 1971, Ander et al. 1988, Bernhardt et al. 1988) that O-demethylases are very 
unstable enzymes. This phenomenon was also experienced in CBS 170.90. It was 
observed that O-demethylase activity in extracts of this fungus was completely lost in 
less than 8 hours at 4°C (unpublished results). In cell-free extracts of veratrate grown 
CBS 170.90 vanillate is demethylated at a higher rate than both isovanillate and 
veratrate (Table 2). In the experiments with veratryl alcohol grown washed cells 
incubated with different substrates vanillate accumulated (Figure 1). Both washed cells 
grown on veratryl alcohol and veratric acid had a higher activity for isovanillate than 
176 Degradation of veratryl alcohol 
for vanillate or veratrate. It is known that some demethylases are specific for either the 
meta- or the para-methoxyl group while other enzymes act on both substrates but at 
various rates for the different molecules (Bernhardt et al. 1988). In view of the instability 
of the demethylating enzyme(s) it has so far not been possible to distinguish whether 
one or more O-demethylases are involved in the degradative route of veratryl alcohol. 
Presently it is being investigated if conditions can be created to stabilize the veratric 
acid demethylating enzyme in order to allow a partial purification.

There were no indications that nonoxidative decarboxylation (Kuwahara et al. 1981, 
Pometto III et al. 1981) or oxidative decarboxylation (Buswell et al. 1979) of veratrate, 
vanillate or isovanillate occurred in CBS 170.90. 
From the results obtained it is clear that protocatechuate is an intermediate in 
the degradation pathway of veratryl alcohol. In contrast to the results of Fujisawa and 
Hayaishi (1968), Wojtas-Wasilewska et al. (1983) have shown that the protocatechuate 
3,4-dioxygenase they purified from Pleurotus ostreatus also has a rather high activity 
for catechol (33%). So it can not be ruled out that only a protocatechuate 3,4-
dioxygenase is present in cell-free extracts of CBS 170.90 grown on veratryl alcohol 
or veratric acid. 
From the results obtained it is concluded that a degradation mechanism for 
veratryl alcohol as described for white-rot fungi as Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
177 Chapter 8 
(Schmidt et al. 1989) does not occur in P. simplicissimum. The new inducible pathway 
for the degradation of this aromatic compound is shown in Figure 2.

PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF VANILLYL 
ALCOHOL OXIDASE FROM PENICILLIUM SIMPLICISSIMUM: 
A NOVEL AROMATIC ALCOHOL OXIDASE CONTAINING 
COVALENTLY BOUND FAD

and Jan A.M. de Bont 
SUMMARY 
Vanillyl alcohol oxidase was purified 32-fold from Penicillium simplicissimum, grown 
on veratryl alcohol as its sole source of carbon and energy. SDS-PAGE of the purified 
enzyme reveals a single fluorescent band of 65 kDa. Gel filtration and sedimentation-
velocity experiments indicate that the purified enzyme exists in solution as an octamer, 
containing 1 molecule flavin/subunit. The covalently bound prosthetic group of the 
enzyme was identified as 8a-(A/3-histidyl)-FAD from pH dependent fluorescence 
quenching (pKa = 4.85) and no decrease in fluorescence upon reduction with sodium 
borohydride. The enzyme shows a narrow substrate specificity, only vanillyl alcohol 
and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol are substrates for the enzyme. Cinnamyl alcohol is a 
strong competitive inhibitor of vanillyl alcohol oxidation. 
The visible absorption spectrum of the oxidized enzyme shows maxima at 354 
nm and 439 nm, and shoulders at 370, 417 and 461 nm. Under anaerobic conditions, 
the enzyme is easily reduced by vanillyl alcohol to the two-electron reduced form. 
Upon mixing with air, rapid reoxidation of the flavin occurs. Both with dithionite 
reduction and photoreduction in the presence of EDTA and 5-deazaflavin the red 
semiquinone flavin radical is transiently stabilized. Opposite to most flavoprotein 
oxidases, vanillyl alcohol oxidase does not form a flavin A/5-sulfite adduct. 
Photoreduction of the enzyme in the presence of the competitive inhibitor cinnamyl 
alcohol gives rise to a complete, irreversible bleaching of the flavin spectrum.

INTRODUCTION 
Fungal aryl-alcohol oxidases (aromatic alcohol oxidase, E.C. 1.1.3.7) described to date 
include enzymes from Polystictus versicolor (Farmer et al. 1960), Pleurotus sajor-caju 
(Bourbonnais and Paice 1988), Pleurotus eryngii (Guillen et al. 1990), Pleurotus 
ostreatus (Sannia et al. 1991), Bjerkandera adusta (Muheim et al. 1990) and from Fusa-
rium sp. (Iwahara et al. 1980). All the extracellular aryl-alcohol oxidases excreted by 
the above-mentioned white-rot fungi have a rather broad substrate specificity. It is 
thought that these aryl-alcohol oxidases play a role in H202 production, necessary in 
lignin biodegradation. The aryl-alcohol oxidases of B. adusta and P. ostreatus are both 
flavoproteins, containing non-covalently bound FAD as prosthetic group. 
The fungus Penicillium simpllcissimum CBS 170.90 is not ligninolytic but can 
use a range of aromatic compounds, including veratryl and vanillyl alcohol, as sole 
source of carbon and energy. Veratryl alcohol plays a crucial role in lignin degradation 
by the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Buswell 1992). P. 
simplicissimum degrades veratryl alcohol via NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenase(s) 
and veratric acid O-demethylase(s) (de Jong et al. 1990). Recently it was found that 
this organism, when grown on veratryl alcohol, induces an intracellular H202-
generating oxidase not acting on veratryl alcohol but rather on vanillyl alcohol. In this 
paper, we describe the production, purification and characterization of this oxidase 
from P. simplicissimum. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
General. Calf intestine phosphatase (grade II, EC 3.1.3.1), hog kidney aminopeptidase 
M (EC 3.4.11.2), glucose oxidase (grade I, EC 1.1.3.4) and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) 
were from Boehringer (Mannheim, FRG). FAD, FMN and naja naja atra snake venom 
(used as a source of phosphodiesterase) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 
Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, Superose 6 and Mono-Q anion exchange column HR 5/5 
were products of Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Hydroxyapatite, Bio-Gel P-6-DG and 
Bio-Gel P-2 were purchased from Bio-Rad (California, USA). Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, 
low-molecular-mass calibration kit and Coomassie brilliant blue R250 were from Serva 
(Heidelberg, FRG). Vanillyl alcohol and vanillin were products of Janssen Chimica 
(Beerse, Belgium), 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde were 
products of Fluka AG (Buchs, Switserland). All the other chemicals were of 
commercially available analytical grade and were used without further purification. 
184 Vanillyl alcohol oxidase 
Analytical methods. The activity of vanillyl alcohol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.-) was assayed 
for spectrophotometrically (Perkin Elmer 550A ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer) by 
following at 340 nm the vanillyl alcohol-dependent production of vanillin (evaninin = 22.8 
mM'1cm'1 at pH 10.0). The reaction mixture (total volume 2.4 ml) contained dialysed 
cell-free extract, 115 mM (NH4)2S04 and 42 mM glycine/NaOH pH 10.0. The reaction 
was started by adding 1.25 mM vanillyl alcohol. 1 U enzyme oxidizes 1 /xmol vanillyl 
alcohol to vanillin in 1 min at 30 °C and pH 10.0. When measuring the pH optimum of 
the oxidase, the activity was corrected for the pH dependence of the molar absorption 
coefficient of vanillin. 
Substrate specificity was measured in a YSI model 53 biological oxygen monitor 
(Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA) by following oxygen 
uptake at 30 °C. The reaction vessel contained 150 ^mol glycine/NaOH, pH 10.0, 275 
^mol (NH4)2S04 and 0.05 U purified enzyme in a total volume of 3.25 ml. The reaction 
was started by adding 100 /xl 10 mM substrate solution. H202 production was 
measured in the biological oxygen monitor, under the same conditions as described 
above, by measuring the oxygen consumption before and after catalase (150 U) 
addition. 
Vanillyl alcohol, vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde 
were determined by HPLC. A Kratos HPLC system (Applied Biosystems B.V., 
Maarssen, The Netherlands) was used with a Chromspher C-18 reverse phase column 
(Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands). The eluent was a mixture of methanol, 
Milli-Q H20 and acetic acid (33:66:1). The ultraviolet spectra of the different com­
pounds were scanned in situ after the flow had been stopped. 
Mass spectra were measured with a Hewlett Packard HP 5890 GC with a 30-m 
DB17 column and a HP 5970 MSD. Sample preparation: the reaction mixture (7.5 ml) 
containing 0.3 mmol glycine, pH 10.0, 0.8 mmol (NH4)2S04, 1 U enzyme and 0.027 
mmol substrate (vanillyl alcohol or 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol) was incubated at 30 °C 
for 90 min. The reaction fluid was injected without derivatization into GC/MS, and mass 
spectra of the two products were recorded. 
Absorption spectra were recorded at 25° C on a DW-2000 ultraviolet/visible 
spectrophotometer (SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL, USA). Enzyme solutions (in 20 mM 
Tris/HCI, pH 8.5) were made anaerobic by alternate evacuation and flushing with 
argon. Enzyme reduction by the substrate was performed in the presence of glucose 
oxidase (10 U) and glucose (310 mM), added to both substrate and enzyme solution 
to remove remaining trace amounts of oxygen. Photoreduction in the presence of 
EDTA and 10-methyl-5-deazaisoalloxazine-3-propanesulfonate (5-deazaflavin) as 
catalyst was performed as described by Massey and Hemmerich (1978) and Duchstein 
et al. (1979). 
185 Chapter 9 
50 mM citrate buffer, pH 3.0, and 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, both 
containing equal concentrations of flavin (peptide) (Singer and Edmondson 1980). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Enzyme purification. P. simplicissimum was routinely grown fed batch in a flat-
bottomed round flask with veratryl alcohol as sole carbon and energy source (de Jong 
et al. 1990). Under these conditions, an intracellular vanillyl alcohol oxidizing activity 
was induced. No extracellular activity of the enzyme was detected. Oxidase activity in 
cell extracts was 75 ± 20 nmol min"1 (mg protein)"1 compared to 38 nmol min"1 (mg 
protein)'1 in extracts of veratrate-grown cells and 18 nmol min"1 (mg protein)"1 in 
extracts of succinate-grown cells. Surprisingly, oxidase activity was only 17 nmol min"1 
(mg protein)"1 in extracts of cells grown on vanillyl alcohol. As veratryl alcohol is not 
a substrate for the oxidase, the physiological role of the enzyme is still unclear. 
Therefore, and because of, the narrow substrate specificity (see catalytic properties) 
the enzyme is named vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO).

Table 1 summarizes the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase purification procedure. On SDS-PAGE, 
the different steps of the purification are shown (Figure 1). In some cases, the final 
step of the purification, using Mono-Q anion-exchange chromatography, resolved the 
enzyme into several peaks of activity. The different peaks had similar specific activities, 
molecular masses on SDS-PAGE were also the same. The different peaks after Mono-
Q purification were combined without further characterization. 
Catalytic properties. Molecular oxygen was required for the oxidation of vanillyl 
alcohol with vanillin and H202 formed in stoichiometric amounts. The reaction was 
188 Vanillyl alcohol oxidase 
linear for several minutes whenever (NH4)2S04 was included in the reaction mixture. 
Enzyme assays degassed with nitrogen showed almost no activity. Oxygen (Km = 12 
/iM, V = 2.4 U (mg protein"1)) could be replaced by phenazine methosulfate (Km = 43 
MM, V = 2.1 U (mg protein"1)). With 2,6-dichloroindophenol and potassium ferricyanide 
as electron acceptors, no reaction was observed.

The relative activity of the enzyme with different substrates was determined by 
measuring the 02 consumption, as described in Materials and Methods. Apart from 
vanillyl alcohol (2.4 U (mg protein)"1, Km 0.73 mM), the enzyme only oxidized 4-
hydroxybenzyl alcohol (75% of the 02 consumption rate compared to vanillyl alcohol). 
Aromatic alcohols not oxidized included 2-bromobenzyl alcohol, 2-hydroxybenzyl 
alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, veratryl alcohol, 
isovanillyl alcohol, 4-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, 1- and 2-phenethyl alcohols, 3- and 
4-methoxybenzyl alcohols. Neither aromatic aldehydes (vanillin, 4-
hydroxybenzaldehyde) nor non-aromatic alcohols (methanol, ethanol, allyl alcohol) 
were oxidized by the enzyme.

The identity of the reaction products after oxidation of vanillyl alcohol and 4-
hydroxybenzyl alcohol were elucidated in two independent ways. 
The enzyme catalyzed oxidation of both substrates was followed by HPLC. Both 
retention times and in situ scanned spectra of the stoichiometric accumulating 
products were identical with the authentic aldehydes. The mass spectra of the 
products were recorded. The product of vanillyl alcohol contained the molecular ion 
at m/z (relative intensity) {M}+ 152 (95%) and the following diagnostic fragments had 
more than 15% abundance: 151 (100%), 123 (20%), 109 (22%), 81 (33%), 51 (19%), 
52 (19%) and 53 (21%). This spectrum was the same as that of authentic vanillin. The 
mass spectrum of the product of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol contained the molecular ion 
at m/z (relative intensity) {M}+ 122 (90%) and there were the following diagnostic 
fragments more than 15% abundance: 121 (100%), 93 (44%), 65 (45%), 63 (13%) and 
39 (43%). This spectrum was the same as that of authentic 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. 
All the substrate analogues tested for activity with the enzyme were tested for 
competitive inhibition of the oxidation of vanillyl alcohol. Cinnamyl alcohol was a strong 
competitive inhibitor with a K, of 84 jiiM at pH 10.0. 4-Hydroxyphenethyl alcohol also 
showed some inhibition, other compounds were not inhibitory at 0.3 mM. 
The enzyme activity, as a function of pH, is shown in Figure 2. The enzyme has 
a broad pH optimum for activity, with more than 90% of the maximum activity being 
observed between pH 9 and 10.5. The optimum temperature for enzyme activity was 
found to be 38 °C. Stability tests showed that the oxidase could be stored at -20 °C 
and at 4° C in 20% (NH4)2S04 at pH 7.0 for several weeks without loss of activity. No 
inactivation occurred after 90 min at 45 ° C, while 50% of the enzyme activity was lost 
after 45 min at 60°C (pH 7.0).

activity of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase. 
The activity was determined in buffers

Hydrodynamic properties. Based on the elution pattern of the Superose-6 column, 
the apparent molecular mass of native vanillyl alcohol oxidase was 520 kDa. The sedi­
mentation coefficient, as determined by ultracentrifugation experiments, also indicated 
a high molecular mass, yielding a value S^ = 16.3S. The subunit molecular mass of 
the enzyme was 65 kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1) and indicates that in 
the native state the enzyme is an octamer composed of eight identical subunits. Both 
the gel filtration and sedimentation pattern did not indicate the presence of other 
association states. Comparable quaternary structures have been reported for alcohol 
oxidase from Hansenula polymorphs and Pichia pastoris (Kato et al. 1976; Hopkins 
and Muller 1987). The minor impurity seen with SDS-PAGE (Figure 1) could not be 
removed by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S300 column. The relative amount of this 
minor band fluctuated in different purifications, and no second fluorescent band 
appeared upon ultraviolet illumination (see also below). Therefore, it is concluded that 
this minor band is an impurity.

Prosthetic group. The purified enzyme showed absorption maxima in the visible 
region at 354 nm and 439 nm, and shoulders at 370, 417 and 461 nm (Figure 3A), 
indicating that the enzyme contains flavin. The ratio of A280/A439 was 13.4 : 1. After 
precipitation of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase by acidification with 5% trichloroacetic acid or 
by heat treatment (95 °C, 30 min), the supernatant did not show any absorbance at 
439 nm, indicating that the flavin prosthetic group is covalently bound. Upon unfolding 
of the enzyme in 0.5% SDS, the absorption maxima decreased in intensity and shifted 
to 352 nm and 450 nm (Figure 3A). The strong hypsochromic shift of the second 
absorption band, as compared to free FAD or FMN, is a characteristic feature of 8a-
substituted flavin (Singer and Edmondson 1980), often found with oxidases containing 
covalently bound flavin (6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase, Mohler et al. 1972; choline 
oxidase, Ohta-Fukuyama et al. 1980; cholesterol oxidase, Fukuyama and Miyake 1979; 
pyranose oxidase, Machida and Nakanishi 1984). 
The visible absorption spectrum of free FMN or FAD does not change upon 
addition of 0.5% SDS (results not shown). If it is assumed that the molar absorption 
coefficient of the unfolded enzyme (e450 = 11.3 mM"1 cm"1, Kiuchi et al. 1982) is 
comparable to that of 8a-substituted FAD (see below), a value (e439 = 12.5 mM"1 cm"1) 
is calculated for the molar absorption coefficient of the native enzyme. From this, the 
quantity of protein/flavin is estimated as 65.1 kg mol'1. 
Four types of 8a-substituted flavins (W1-histidyl, A/3-histidyl, O-tyrosyl and S-
cysteinyl) are known (Singer and Mclntire 1984). As firmly established by Singer and 
Edmondson (1980), 8a-histidylflavins exhibit a characteristic increase in fluorescence 
below pH 6. SDS-treated vanillyl-alcohol oxidase also showed pH-dependent 
fluorescence properties (Figure 3B). Upon treatment of the unfolded enzyme with nay'a 
naja snake venom, there was a threefold increase of fluorescence at pH 6 (Figure 3B). 
These results indicate that the flavin derivative is present at the FAD level and is 
covalently bound via a histidyl moiety at the 8a position. Additional evidence for the 
presence of this type of flavin comes from the observation that upon ultraviolet 
illumination of unstained SDS-PAGE gels, one strongly fluorescent band (65 kDa) is 
observed when the protein is fixed in 5% acetic acid (Kvalnes-Krick and Schumann-
Jorns 1986). 
In order to discriminate between an 8a-(A/1-histidyl) or 8a-(A/3-histidyl) linkage 
between flavin and protein, aminoacylriboflavin was prepared by proteolytic digestion 
of the enzyme and successive treatment of the solubilized flavin peptide with 
phosphodiesterase, alkaline phosphatase and aminopeptidase M (see Materials and 
Methods). The aminopeptidase-treated flavin peptide eluted on Bio-Gel P-2 as two 
separate yellow bands, most probably due to incomplete enzymic hydrolysis. 
Aminoacylriboflavin (about 70% of total flavin yield) eluted in the second strongly 
193 Chapter 9 
retarded band, as evidenced by TLC and the low ratio A280/A450 = 3.0. 
Figure 3C shows the excitation spectrum of the aminoacylriboflavin preparation 
obtained after Bio-Gel P-2. The maximum at 349 nm again is indicative for an So-
substituted flavin. The fluorescence quantum yield observed at pH 3.8 is in the same 
range as found for free riboflavin or FMN. In the pH-dependent fluorescence 
measurements, a tenfold increase in fluorescence was observed at low pH (inset 
Figure 3C). The observed pKa of 4.85 is in close agreement with the reported pKa of 
4.7for8a-(A/3-histidyl)riboflavin (Edmondson et al. 1976). Unlike the A/3-histidylriboflavin 
isomer, A/1-histidylriboflavin is easily reduced by sodium borohydride (Edmondson et 
al. 1976), which leads to a strong decrease in fluorescence. No decrease in 
fluorescence was observed when the Bio-Gel P-2 purified aminoacylriboflavin 
preparation was treated with sodium borohydride. Furthermore, and unlike A/1-
histidylriboflavin (Edmondson et al. 1978), the aminoacylriboflavin preparation was very 
stable upon storage at room temperature. It is therefore concluded that vanillyl alcohol 
oxidase from P. simplicissimum contains 8a-(A/3-histidyl)-FAD as a covalently bound 
prosthetic group. Decker and Brandsch (1991) have recently reviewed the physical 
properties of flavoproteins with a covalent 8a-(A/3-histidyl)-FAD linkage, including 6-
hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase and choline oxidase. 
Spectral properties. Anaerobic reduction of enzyme-bound flavin by vanillyl alcohol 
resulted in a decrease in absorbance at 440 nm without any detectable semiquinone 
formation (Figure 4), indicating that the flavin component is functionally involved in the 
oxidation of vanillyl alcohol. The increase in absorbance at 347 nm is due to the 
formation of vanillin, as demonstrated by aerobically incubating the enzyme with 
excess substrate (inset Figure 4). Reoxidation of enzyme with air immediately gave the 
typical oxidized flavin spectrum at 440 nm (data not shown). 
The binding of cinnamyl alcohol, a competitive inhibitor, was investigated. The 
Kj of cinnamyl alcohol binding to vanillyl alcohol oxidase, as determined with 
absorption difference spectroscopy, was determined to be 1.6 mM at pH 8.5 (Figure 
5) and 127 /xM at pH 10.0 (20 mM glycine, data not shown). Cinnamyl alcohol could 
be resolved from the enzyme-inhibitor complex by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-6-DG. 
Vanillyl alcohol oxidase did not show any reactivity with sulfite. In general, 
flavoprotein oxidases form an N5 adduct, with spectral properties resembling those of 
reduced flavin (Massey et al. 1969). Addition of 11.1 mM sulfite did not result in any 
spectral changes of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase, neither in 20 mM Tris/HCI, pH 8.5, nor in 
20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Also, old yellow enzyme and putrescine oxidase 
(Massey and Hemmerich 1980; DeSa 1972), both producing a red semiquinone flavin 
radical, do not form a flavin A/5-sulfite adduct.

Another general property of flavoprotein oxidases is the stabilization of the 
semiquinone anionic radical (Muller 1987). Stabilization does not necessarily imply the 
occurrence of radical states in the catalytic reaction, but can give some important 
structural information. The possible stabilization of the anionic radical was investigated 
with both photoreduction and reduction by sodium dithionite. Photoreduction of the 
enzyme gave rise to the formation of the red-coloured semiquinone radical (Figure 6A). 
The predominant formation of the semiquinone is indicated by the formation of three 
isosbestic points at 357, 406 and 490 nm. On longer illumination, these points are lost, 
showing the conversion of semiquinone to fully reduced enzyme. Also, anaerobic 
titration of the enzyme with dithionite gave rise to the formation of the red semiquinone 
radical (maximal absorbance at 376 nm). Essentially, the same spectrum of (partially) 
195 Chapter 9 
reduced enzyme was formed, and also the same three isosbestic points (356,406 and 
490 nm) as with photoreduction were observed (data not shown). In both cases 
complete reoxidation was observed almost immediately on mixing with air.

100 mM cinnamyl alcohol dissolved in 60% ethanol were added. Temperature was 18°C. 
Photoreduction of vanillyl alcohol oxidase in the presence of EDTA, 5-deazaflavin and 
cinnamyl alcohol gave interesting spectral modifications (Figure 6B). No isosbestic 
points were formed upon illumination, and also formation of the red semiquinone 
radical was not seen. On mixing with air, no reoxidation of the enzyme was observed. 
Also gel filtration and addition of vanillyl alcohol did not give rise to reoxidation of the 
enzyme. Vanillyl alcohol oxidase reduced in the presence of cinnamyl alcohol lost 
almost all of its activity with vanillyl alcohol. A possible explanation is the formation of 
a covalent bond between cinnamyl alcohol and the flavin. Singer (1991) reviewed 
several classes of irreversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase. Besides flavin adducts 
also amino acid adducts are possible. Unfolding of photoreduced, cinnamyl alcohol 
inhibited vanillyl-alcohol oxidase with 0.5% SDS did not give any increase in absor-
bance at 450 nm. This indicates a covalent bond between cinnamyl alcohol and FAD.

In contrast, photoreduction in the presence of vanillin instead of cinnamyl alcohol 
under the same conditions, as described above, gave a delayed but complete 
reduction and also one isosbestic point (490 nm) could be observed. The high 
absorbance of vanillin prevents the observation of the red semiquinone radical and the 
other two isosbestic points. On mixing with air, complete reoxidation was almost 
immediately observed (data not shown). 
CONCLUSIONS 
P. simplicissimum CBS 170.90 produces an intracellular vanillyl alcohol oxidase when 
grown on veratryl alcohol. The physiological role of the oxidase is not yet clear but it 
is unlikely that the oxidase plays a significant role in the degradation of veratryl alcohol 
(De Jong et al. 1990). This intracellular enzyme does not resemble the other described 
extracellular aryl-alcohol oxidases from S. adusta (Muheim et al. 1990), P. sajor-caju 
(Bourbonnais and Paice 1988), P. ostreatus (Sannia et al. 1991), P. eryngii (Guillen et 
al. 1990) and P. versicolor (Farmer et al. 1960) with respect to substrate specificity, 
molecular mass and pH optimum. 
A main characteristic of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase is the necessity of a hydroxy 
group at the para position of the benzyl alcohol. The aryl-alcohol oxidases described 
so far have much broader substrate specificities and show less (S. adusta, P. ostreatus 
and P. versicolor) or no activity (P. sajor-caju) with compounds containing a hydroxy 
instead of a methoxy group at the para position. 
From the gel filtration and SDS-PAGE experiments, it is concluded that vanillyl-
alcohol oxidase contains 1 mol of flavin/mol monomeric enzyme and that in solution 
the enzyme exists as a multimer, probably an octamer of 520 kDa. Vanillyl-alcohol 
oxidase from P. simplicissimum contains 8a-(A/3-histidyl)-FAD as a covalently bound 
prosthetic group. 
The lack of flavin-adduct formation with sulfite, and the conversion into fully 
reduced enzyme upon continued illumination, makes it clear that vanillyl-alcohol 
oxidase is not a typical representative of the class of flavoprotein oxidases (Massey 
and Hemmerich 1980). Also, the nature of the irreversible bleaching of the flavin 
spectrum by cinnamyl alcohol remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Fundamental aspects of lignin biodegradation and the interactions between fungi and 
aryl alcohols have been addressed in this thesis to investigate the possibilities of white-
rot fungi and/or their extracellular ligninolytic enzymes for biopulping of woody 
materials. In this final chapter three aspects emerging from this thesis are considered: 
The ligninolytic system of white-rot fungi, the potential of these fungi for 
biotechnological applications and the implications of chlorinated aromatic compound 
production in natural environments. 
THE LIGNINOLYTIC SYSTEM OF WHITE-ROT FUNGI 
Phenol oxidases and the initial oxidation of lignin. In this thesis, the interactions 
between fungi and aryl alcohols have been addressed. The chapters 3,4,5 and 6 dealt 
with the isolation and characterisation of a white-rot fungus, Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, 
with a high peroxidative activity. An interesting aspect of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 was 
its production of the novel enzyme manganese independent peroxidase (MiP), 
simultaneously with lignin peroxidase (UP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) 
(chapters 3 and 6). This observation is another illustration of the fact that the 
ligninolytic system of white-rot fungi is more diverse as once thought (chapter 2, Kirk 
and Farrell 1987). Since the discovery of lignin and manganese peroxidases about 10 
years ago, a huge amount of fundamental knowledge about physiological, enzymatic 
and mechanistic aspects of lignin biodegradation has been acquired. However, from 
all the evidence available (Kirk and Farrell 1987, Buswell 1992), it is still not clear what 
the primary agents of lignin degradation in white-rot fungi are (Kirk and Hammel 1992) 
and if all white-rot fungi basically use the same system. In recent years, the enzymatic 
201 Chapter 10 
machinery of several white-rot fungi has been examined. UP was once thought to be 
an obligatory enzyme in the initial steps of lignin biodegradation. Indeed, several facts 
indicate that UP is important in lignin and xenobiotic degradation (chapter 2), and 
recently it has been proven that the enzyme can depolymerize dilute solutions of lignin 
In vitro (Hammel et al. 1993). However, two major observations make it questionable 
if LiP is indeed essential in the biodegradation of lignin. Firstly, several fungi do not 
produce detectable amounts of LiP (chapter 2), but can readily oxidize lignin to C02. 
Secondly, it appears that LiP does not penetrate the lignocellulosic matrix in sound 
wood (Evans et al. 1991). Although, in some cases, electron micrographs have shown 
a diffuse delignification throughout the secondary wall. It is possible that LiP is only 
active as ligninolytic catalysts at the surface of lignin, but it is also possible that low 
molecular weight compounds, such as Mn"' or veratryl alcohol, and subsequent 
charge-transfer reactions are responsible for the initial steps of lignin biodegradation. 
Table 1. Classification of white-rot fungi according to their type of wood decay. 
Type of wood decay * White-rot fungi 
1 Selective wood delignification D. squalens, C. subvermispora 
2 Simultaneous decay of lignin and Trametes versicolor, T, hirsuta 
polysaccharides throughout the wood 
3 Combination of selective delignification and P. chrysosporium, Lentinula edodes 
simultaneous decay within the same substrate 
* The type of wood decay is determined using both light and electron microscopes. Several white-
rot fungi, e.g. P. chrysosporium and Lentinula edodes, exhibit considerable diversity in 
delignification capacity among different strains and growth substrates. The discrimination 
between the groups 1 and 3 is not clear cut. 
In chapter 2, it has been shown that almost every possible combination of ligninolytic 
enzymes (LiP, MnP, MiP and Laccase) has been encountered among the different 
white-rot fungi investigated. However, the absence of a certain enzyme may be due 
to the growth conditions rather than to the fungus's inability to produce it. Therefore, 
the enzyme profiles of white-rot fungi grown on lignocellulosic substrates instead of 
synthetic media should be analyzed. The extracellular enzymes of newly isolated 
ligninolytic fungi, grown on hemp stem wood, were investigated to get an indication 
which enzymes were actually produced (chapter 3). All ligninolytic fungi produced 
manganese peroxidase and many of these fungi also produced laccase. Lignin 
peroxidase was only produced in minor amounts by Phanerochaete chrysosporium. 
Similar results were observed by Datta et al. (1991) when P. chrysosporium was grown 
on aspen pulp. 
202 Concluding Remarks 
In Table 1, three different types of wood decay are presented. It is still unclear 
how the different types arise. The white-rot fungi Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and 
Dichomitus squalens do not produce LiP and give an extensive and selective 
delignification combined with little enzyme penetration. Both Kirk and Hammel (1992) 
and Srebotnik and Messner (1993) have suggested that Mn'" is the low molecular 
weight agent responsible for this kind of delignification. It has been shown that MnP 
as well as Mn'" causes depolymerization of lignin in vitro (chapter 2). Future research 
should elucidate if Mn'" is always a prerequisite for extensive lignin-degradation. 
Extracellular enzymes producing H202. Lignin biodegradation research has focused 
mainly on the regulation, production and action of the different phenol oxidases (Kirk 
and Farrell 1987, Buswell 1992). It is now also generally accepted that H202 is an 
important ligninolytic agent. However, the enzymes and substrates involved in H202-
production and their regulation are poorly understood. Three extracellular oxidases 
essential for the H202-generation have been detected. P. chrysosporium synthesizes 
extracellular glyoxal oxidase and pyranose-2-oxidase. Bjerkandera and Pleurotus spp. 
also produce an extracellular aryl alcohol oxidase (MO, chapter 2), for which 
previously de novo biosynthesized veratryl and p-anisyl alcohol have been considered 
as the physiological substrates. This thesis has shown that Bjerkandera BOS55 also 
biosynthesizes de novo chlorinated anisyl alcohols, which have a physiological role 
because they are excellent substrates for AAO and the formed aldehydes are readily 
recycled by reduction to the corresponding alcohols (chapters 5 and 6). AAO has a 
much higher affinity for the chlorinated anisyl alcohols compared to veratryl and anisyl 
alcohol. On the other hand LiP did not catalyze the oxidation of the chlorinated anisyl 
alcohols indicating the electron withdrawing Cl-groups make the aromatic ring less 
oxidizable by the fungus's own aggresive ligninolytic enzymes. It is presently unknown 
if the uptake of the chlorinated aldehydes is energy dependent. Until now, only one 
report has described the carrier mediated transport of halogenated aromatic 
compounds (4-chlorobenzoate) in bacteria (Groenewegen et al. 1990), but nothing is 
known yet about such transport mechanisms in eukaryotes. 
Further research should elucidate the in vivo extracellular H202-production rate 
because it can actually be the rate-limiting step in lignin and xenobiotic biodegradation. 
Role of veratryl alcohol/LiP couple. Aryl alcohols are very common secondary 
metabolites of white-rot fungi produced simultaneously with their ligninolytic enzymes 
(chapters 2 and 6). In chapter 2 the literature concerning the important physiological 
functions of veratryl alcohol have been reviewed. Aside from serving as oxidase 
substrates at least one aryl alcohol, veratryl alcohol, has been shown to be essential 
203 Chapter 10 
for LiP and has been subject of intense debate. The production of veratryl alcohol and 
LiP are highly correlated in Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 (chapter 6), indicating they are 
regulated in parallel. A physiological role for veratryl alcohol as a stabilisator of LiP 
against H202 inactivation has been established. Addionally, charge-transfer reactions 
involved in lignin biodegradation have been attributed to the LiP/veratryl alcohol 
couple. However, future research is still necessary to clarify the extent of these 
mediated reactions. It is interesting to speculate if the LiP/veratryl alcohol-generated 
activated oxygen species are partly the cause of the considerable fibre damage seen 
by Srebotnik and Messner (1993) with P. chrysosporium. 
POTENTIAL OF WHITE-ROT FUNGI FOR BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS 
Biopulping of wood. One of the objectives of this thesis was to investigate the 
possibilities of white-rot fungi and/or their extracellular ligninolytic enzymes for the 
biopulping of woody materials. The recent progress made with the non-LiP producing 
fungi C. subvermispora and D. squalens shows that biomechanical pulping is technical 
feasible for wood and probably also for hemp. The non-LiP producing fungi combine 
a high degree of delignification with little enzyme penetration. This lack of penetration, 
even in completely delignified fibres, suggest that delignification occurs without a direct 
contact between ligninolytic enzymes and lignin. It was suggested that low molecular 
weight compounds, plausibly Mn'", are the actual active species. These results suggest 
that a biomimetic delignification with Mn'" may be possible. Future research should 
elucidate if and under which temperature and pH ranges Mn'" is an active ligninolytic 
agent and if other additional low molecular weight compounds and/or enzymes are 
necessary. Also Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 seems to be a good candidate for a selective 
degradation of lignin, because this organism produces high amounts of manganese 
peroxidase and no lignin peroxidase when grown on hemp stem wood (chapters 3 
and 6). However, the simultaneous production of chlorinated aromatics can be a 
drawback. 
Bioremediation. The random and non-specific nature of the lignin-degrading system 
also attacks other compounds containing an aromatic structure, such as many 
xenobiotic compounds. It has been shown with in vitro experiments that LiP, MnP and 
Mn'" cause the oxidation of a variety of environmental pollutants and that whole 
cultures cause extensive mineralization (Field et al. 1993). Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 was 
found to be the best polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrader among a number of 
white-rot fungi screened (Field et al. 1992). The first promising results with in situ 
204 Concluding Remarks 
bioremediation of contaminated soils and wood (Lamar and Dietrich 1990) with white-
rot fungi have been reported. 
Aside from mineralization, ligninolytic enzymes can also be used to polymerize 
pollutants to non-toxic compounds. The resulting chlorinated compounds should be 
considered as environmental safe products since also non-toxic, natural chlorohumus 
occurs at high concentrations (Asplund and Grimvall 1991). This novel approach of 
copolymerization into chlorohumus may lead to more rapid bioremediation methods. 
Flavour and fragrance production. Several white-rot fungi, including S. adusta and 
Ischnoderma benzoinum have been proposed as suitable organisms for the production 
of aromatic compounds. However, the production of desired compounds can be 
accompanied with the formation of unwanted but physiological important side 
products, e.g. the production of chlorinated anisyl metabolites (CAM) (chapters 5,6 
and 7).

potentially leading to the formation of sinapyl alcohol, was not a substrate for the enzyme. 
Also hyphomycetes can be used for flavour and fragrance production. Recent 
research with vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO) from Penicillium simplicissimum (chapters 
8 and 9) has revealed some interesting results regarding the substrate specificity of 
this enzyme. In addition to vanillyl alcohol also eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) and 
chavicol (4-allylphenol) are oxidized by the enzyme (van Berkel et al. 1993). The 
reaction products coniferyl and coumaryl alcohol, which are two of the natural building 
blocks for lignin (chapter 2), are formed in stoichiometric amounts (Figure 1). 
205 Chapter 10 
Unfortunately, 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol which is the predicted precursor for sinapyl 
alcohol, was not oxidized by the enzyme, probably because of sterical hinderance. 
With this unique process, which has been patented (Unilever 1993), the inexpensive 
production of (labelled) synthetic lignins such as the dehydrogenative polymer (DHP) 
of coniferyl alcohol and mixtures with coumaryl alcohol will become possible. Future 
research is directed to solve the intriguing reaction mechanism of VAO. In order to 
produce all three lignin precursors, attempts will be made to alter the substrate 
specificity of the enzyme. 
PRODUCTION OF CHLORINATED AROMATIC COMPOUNDS IN NATURAL 
ENVIRONMENTS 
Chlorinated aromatic compounds are priority pollutants which were largely considered 
to be of man-made origin. This thesis has shown that many common occurring wood-
and forest litter-degrading basidiomycetes, e.g. Hypholoma fasciculare, H. capnoides, 
Oudemansiella mucida, Bjerkandera adusta, Pholiota squarrosa, Lepista nuda, 
produce chlorinated anisyl metabolites (CAM) in the natural environment in 
concentrations exceeding those permitted by Dutch environmental legislation (chapter 
7). We proposed that aside from complete mineralisation to C02, CAM intermediates 
can give rise to detoxification reactions leading to chlorohumus (natural AOX polymers) 
and biotoxification reactions resulting in the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-
dioxins and dibenzofurans. Fungal chlorinated aromatic compounds and their natural 
biotoxification products are probably just as dangerous as their anthropogenic 
counterparts. Future research should focus on the ubiquity among fungi to produce 
chlorinated aromatic compounds and relate the natural occurrence of these priority 
pollutants to existing environmental norms. Moreover, much is to be learned from the 
transformation/degradation reactions of natural chloroaromatics in the environment, 
which will give us clues to novel bioremediation methods.

210 SUMMARY 
The major structural elements of wood and other vascular tissues are cellulose, 
hemicellulose and generally 20-30% lignin. Lignin gives the plant strength, it serves as 
a barrier against microbial attack and it acts as a water impermeable seal across cell 
walls of the xylem tissue. However, the presence of lignin has practical drawbacks for 
some of the applications of lignocellulosic materials. First, lignin has to be removed for 
the production of high quality pulps. Second, lignin reduces the digestibility of 
lignocellulosic materials. High quality pulps can be produced with chemical methods, 
however the abundant use of chemicals and energy, and the formation of an 
enormous waste stream has led scientists to investigate the possibilities of 
biodelignification. White-rot fungi give the most rapid and extensive degradation and 
have become subject of intensive research. Results obtained with the model organism 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium and other strains have revealed that lignin 
biodegradation is an extracellular, oxidative and non-specific process. This unique 
biodegradative potential has been considered for broader applications such as waste 
water treatment and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds. The research 
described in this thesis concentrates on the function of aryl alcohols in fungal 
physiology. 
Aryl alcohols in the physiology of white-rot fungi. White-rot fungi have a versatile 
machinery of enzymes, including peroxidases and oxidases, which work in harmony 
with secondary aryl alcohol metabolites to degrade the recalcitrant, aromatic 
biopolymer lignin. In chapter 2 literature concerning the important physiological roles 
of aryl (veratryl, anisyl and chlorinated anisyl) alcohols in the ligninolytic enzyme 
system has been reviewed. Their functions include stabilization of lignin peroxidase, 
charge-transfer reactions and as substrate for oxidases generating extracellular H202. 
The experimental research described in this thesis was initiated to evaluate the Summary 
possibilities of white-rot fungi in the biopulping of hemp stem wood. Sixty-seven 
basidiomycetes were isolated and screened for high peroxidative activity (chapter 3). 
Several of the new isolates were promising manganese peroxidase-producing white-rot 
fungi. Enzyme assays indicated that for the production of H202 either extracellular 
glyoxal or aryl alcohol oxidase were present. In contrast, lignin peroxidase was only 
detected in P. chrysosporium, despite attempts to induce this enzyme in other strains 
with oxygen and oxygen/veratryl alcohol additions. A highly significant correlation was 
found between two ligninolytic indicators: ethene formation from a-keto-y-
methylthiolbutyric acid and the decolorization of a polymeric dye, Poly R-478. Three 
of the new isolates had significantly higher Poly R decolorizing activities compared to 
P. chrysosporium. 
One of the best Poly R decolorizing strains, Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 was 
selected for further characterization. A novel enzyme activity (manganese independent 
peroxidase) was detected in the extracellular fluid of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 (chapter 
4). The purified enzyme could oxidize several compounds like phenol red, 2,6-
dimethoxyphenol (DMP), Poly R-478, 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic 
acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and guaiacol with H202 as an electron acceptor. In 
contrast, veratryl alcohol was not a substrate. This enzyme also had the capacity to 
oxidize DMP in the absence of H202. Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 also produced de novo 
several aromatic metabolites. Besides veratryl alcohol and veratraldehyde, compounds 
which are known to be involved in the ligninolytic system of several other white-rot 
fungi (chapter 2), other metabolites were formed. These included anisaldehyde, 3-
chloro-anisaldehyde, 3,5-dichloro-anisaldehyde and small amounts of the 
corresponding anisyl, 3-chloro-anisyl and 3,5-dichloro-anisyl alcohol (chapters 5 and 
6). This was the first report of de novo biosynthesis of simple chlorinated aromatic 
compounds by a white-rot fungus. These unexpected findings led us investigate the 
physiological role(s) of the de novo biosynthesized chlorinated anisyl alcohols (chapter 
6). All metabolites were produced simultaneously with the extracellular ligninolytic 
enzymes. The mono- and dichlorinated anisyl alcohols appeared to be excellent 
substrates for the extracellular aryl alcohol oxidases. The formed aldehydes were 
readily recycled via reduction by washed fungal mycelium, thus creating an 
extracellular H202 production system regulated by intracellular enzymes. Lignin 
peroxidase does not oxidize the chlorinated anisyl alcohols both in the absence and 
in the presence of veratryl alcohol. It was therefore concluded that the chlorinated 
anisyl alcohols are well protected against the fungus's own aggressive ligninolytic 
enzymes. The relative amounts of veratryl alcohol and the chlorinated anisyl alcohols 
differ significantly depending on the growth conditions, indicating that the production 
of veratryl alcohol and the (chlorinated) anisyl metabolites are independently regulated. 
212 Summary 
It was concluded that the chlorinated anisyl metabolites, biosynthesized by the 
white-rot fungus Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, are purposeful for ecologically significant 
processes such as lignin degradation. These results made us speculate if a significant 
biogenesis of chlorinated aromatics by fungi occurs in natural environments (chapter 
7). Many common wood- and forest litter-degrading fungi were indeed detected that 
produced chlorinated anisyl metabolites (CAM). These compounds, which are 
structurally related to xenobiotic chloroaromatics, were present in the environment and 
occur at high concentrations of approximately 75 mg CAM kg"1 wood or litter. The 
ubiquity among common fungi to produce large amounts of chlorinated aromatic 
compounds in the environment leads to the conclusion that these kind of compounds 
can no longer be considered to originate from anthropogenic sources only. 
Degradation of aryl alcohols by fungi. In chapter 2 the anabolic and catabolic routes 
of aryl alcohols by white-rot fungi has been reviewed. These fungi can not use veratryl 
alcohol as sole source of carbon and energy. However, several bacteria, yeasts and 
fungi were selectively isolated from paper mill waste water that grew on veratryl alcohol 
(chapter 8). Penicillium simplicissimum was selected for the characterization of the 
veratryl alcohol degradation route. P. simplicissimum oxidized veratryl alcohol via a 
NAD(P)+-dependent veratryl alcohol dehydrogenase to veratraldehyde which was 
further oxidized to veratric acid in a NAD(P)+-dependent reaction. Veratric acid-grown 
cells contained NAD(P)H-dependent O-demethylase activity for veratrate, vanillate and 
isovanillate. Ring-cleavage of protocatechuate was by a protocatechuate 3,4-
dioxygenase. An interesting aspect of P. simplicissimum is the production of vanillyl 
alcohol oxidase with covalently bound FAD (chapter 9). The intracellular enzyme was 
purified 32-fold. SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme revealed a single fluorescent band 
of 65 Kda. Gel filtration and sedimentation-velocity experiments indicated that the 
purified enzyme exists in solution as an octamer, containing 1 molecule flavin/subunit. 
The covalently bound prosthetic group of the enzyme was identified as 8a-(A/3-histidyl)-
FAD from pH dependent fluorescence quenching (pKa = 4.85) and no decrease in 
fluorescence upon reduction with sodium borohydride. The enzyme showed a narrow 
and rather peculiar substrate specificity. In addition to vanillyl alcohol and 4-
hydroxybenzyl alcohol, eugenol and chavicol are substrates for the enzyme (chapter 
10). The formed products, coniferyl and coumaryl alcohol are the natural precursors 
of lignin in plants. This reaction has a potential application to produce coniferyl alcohol 
and subsequent synthetic lignin (DHP) from the inexpensive precursor eugenol. 
213 SAMENVATTING 
De drie belangrijkste bouwstenen van hout en andere planten met een vaatweefsel zijn 
cellulose, hemicellulose en gewoonlijk 20-30% lignine. Lignine, oftewel houtstof, geeft 
de plant sterkte, beschermt de plant tegen ongewenste microbiele aantasting en zorgt 
voor een waterondoordringbare afdichting van de celwanden in het xyleemweefsel van 
planten. Bij het gebruik van hout en houtachtige gewassen levert de aanwezigheid van 
lignine echter in een aantal gevallen grote problemen op. Ten eerste moet bij de 
bereiding van het zogenaamde houtvrije papier alle lignine verwijderd worden. Ook bij 
de bereiding van krantepapier, waar de lignine nog inzit en die daardoor vergeelt, 
zorgt juist de in het hout aanwezige lignine voor een grote energieconsumptie. Ten 
tweede verlaagt de aanwezigheid van lignine de verteerbaarheid van planten voor 
mens en dier. Bij de huidige produktieprocessen voor houtvrij papier wordt de lignine 
verwijderd met behulp van grote hoeveelheden chemicalien en bij een hoge 
temperatuur. Dit proces genereert tevens een grote afvalstroom. De grote praktische 
voordelen die een biologische in plaats van een chemische verwijdering van lignine 
geeft, heeft vele wetenschappers er toe aangezet de mogelijkheden van 
biodelignificatie te onderzoeken. 
Lignine wordt door micro-organismen niet makkelijk afgebroken omdat het een 
complex driedimensionaal molecuul is met op een groot aantal plaatsen allerlei 
verschillende soorten bindingen. Van alle micro-organismen geven de zogenaamde 
wit-rot schimmels nog de snelste en grootste afbraak van lignine terwijl de cellulose 
in eerste instantie grotendeels intact blijft. Onderzoek met het model organisme, 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium, en andere paddestoelen die wit-rot veroorzaken, heeft 
aangetoond dat de afbraak van lignine een extracellulair, oxidatief en aspecifiek proces 
is. Hoewel de chaotische struktuur van lignine het niet aannemelijk maakte, bleek toch 
een extracellulair enzymsysteem verantwoordelijk voor de eerste stappen in het 
afbraak proces. Dit voor micro-organismen unieke enzymsysteem heeft de aandacht Samenvatting 
op een aantal andere toepassingsgebieden gericht waarvan hier de afvalwaterzuivering 
en de verwijdering van milieuvreemde (xenobiotica) stoffen worden genoemd. Het 
onderzoek dat in dit proefschrift is beschreven, heeft zich voornamelijk gericht op de 
rol van aryl alcoholen in de fysiologie van (wit-rot) schimmels. 
Aryl alcoholen in de fysiologie van wit-rot schimmels. Bij de afbraak van hout en 
houtige gewassen produceren wit-rot schimmels een groot aantal extracellulaire 
enzymen, waaronder peroxidases en oxidases. Deze enzymen werken in nauw 
verband samen met de novo gesynthetiseerde metabolieten, de aryl alcoholen. In 
hoofdstuk 2 wordt een literatuur overzicht gegeven van de biosynthese van aryl 
(veratryl, anisyl en gechloreerde anisyl) alcoholen door schimmels uit de klasse van 
de basidiomyceten. Tevens worden de fysiologische functies van deze verbindingen 
verduidelijkt. Tot de belangrijkste functies van de aryl alcoholen behoren de stabilisatie 
van het lignine peroxidase, het overbrengen van lading (mediator) waardoor een 
oxidatie op afstand van het enzym plaatsvindt, en het fungeren als substraat voor 
extracellulaire oxidases waardoor waterstofperoxide (H202) geproduceerd wordt. 
Daarnaast wordt in hoofdstuk 2 aangegeven hoe deze aryl alcoholen ook weer 
afgebroken kunnen worden door wit-rot schimmels. 
Het onderzoek dat beschreven wordt in dit proefschrift is gestart om de 
mogelijkheden te inventariseren van wit-rot schimmels bij de biopulping van hennep 
houtpijp. Er werden 67 basidiomyceten geTsoleerd die vervolgens geanalyseerd 
werden op hun peroxidatieve vermogens (hoofdstuk 3). Een aantal van de ge'i'soleerde 
wit-rot schimmels was veelbelovend, gelet op hun produktie van mangaan peroxidase. 
Daarentegen werd lignine peroxidase, waarvan algemeen werd aangenomen dat het 
een noodzakelijk enzym is voor de lignine afbraak, alleen maar bij het modelorganisme 
P. chrysosporium aangetroffen. Extracellulair waterstofperoxide werd geproduceerd 
met glyoxal oxidase of met aryl alcohol oxidase. Er werd een significante correlatie 
gevonden tussen de verschillende ligninolytische testen zoals de ontkleuring van een 
polymere kleurstof Poly R-478 en de afbraak van polycyclische aromatische 
koolwaterstoffen. 
Een van de stammen met de hoogste Poly R ontkleuringssnelheid werd 
uitgekozen voor nader onderzoek. Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 produceerde naast lignine 
en mangaan peroxidase een derde klasse van peroxidases, namelijk mangaan 
onafhankelijk peroxidase (MiP, hoofdstuk 4). Het gezuiverde enzym kan een groot 
aantal verbindingen oxideren, waaronder phenol rood, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol en Poly 
R-478. Veratryl alcohol was echter geen substraat voor MiP. Een interessant kenmerk 
van het enzym is het feit dat een aantal substraten ook in de afwezigheid van H202 
geoxideerd wordt. Naast enzymen produceerde Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 ook een groot 
216 Samenvatting 
aantal secundaire metabolieten. De bekende metabolieten veratryl alcohol en 
veratraldehyde werden ook door BOS55 gesynthetiseerd. Opmerkelijk was echter dat 
er tevens 3-chloro-anisyl alcohol en 3,5-dichloro-anisyl alcohol en de 
corresponderende aldehydes de novo gesynthetiseerd werden. Het in de 
hoofdstukken 5 en 6 beschreven werk toont voor het eerst aan dat een wit-rot 
schimmel gechloreerde aromaten produceert die een fysiologische rol vervullen in de 
lignine afbraak als substraat voor het extracellulaire aryl alcohol oxidase. De gevormde 
aldehydes werden intracellular gereduceerd tot de corresponderende alcoholen zodat 
een cyclisch H202-producerend systeem ontstaat. Lignine peroxidase vertoonde zowel 
in de aan- als afwezigheid van veratryl alcohol geen enkele activiteit met de 
gechloreerde anisyl alcoholen. Uit deze resultaten werd geconcludeerd dat de 
gechloreerde aromaten goed beschermd zijn tegen het agressieve ligninolytische 
enzymsysteem van de schimmel zelf. Het feit dat de gechloreerde aromaten een 
fysiologische rol in de afbraak van lignine spelen als H202-donor en niet makkelijk 
afgebroken worden door de ligninolytische enzymen gaf aanleiding te onderzoeken 
of veel verschillende schimmels deze verbindingen maken en of ze ook in het milieu 
in grote hoeveelheden voorkomen (hoofdstuk 7). Het bleek dat een groot aantal 
algemeen voorkomende paddestoelen, waaronder de gewone zwavelkop (Hypholoma 
fasciculare), de dennezwavelkop (Hypholoma capnoides), de porseleinzwam 
(Oudemansiella mucida), de grijze gaatjeszwam (Bjerkandera adusta), de geschubde 
bundelzwam (Pholiota squarrosa) en de paarse schijnridder (Lepista nuda), 
gechloreerde anisyl metabolieten (CAM) maakt. De CAM concentraties liepen op tot 
75 mg CAM per kg hout. Uit het algemeen voorkomen van CAM produktie door 
paddestoelen en uit de hoge concentraties waarin CAM voorkwam in het natuurlijke 
milieu werd geconcludeerd dat menselijk handelen niet de enige belangrijke oorzaak 
voor de aanwezigheid van gechloreerde aromatische verbindingen in het milieu is. 
Afbraak van aryl alcoholen door schimmels. In hoofdstuk 2 is een overzicht 
gegeven van de synthese- en afbraakroutes van aryl alcoholen door wit-rot schimmels. 
Deze schimmels kunnen veratryl alcohol echter niet als enige koolstof- en energiebron 
gebruiken. Een groot aantal andere micro-organismen kon echter gei'soleerd worden 
op veratryl alcohol uit het afvalwater van een papierfabriek (hoofdstuk 8). Penicillium 
simplicissimum werd uitgekozen om de afbraakroute van veratryl alcohol op te 
helderen. P. simplicissimum oxideerde veratryl alcohol via twee NAD(P)+-afhankelijke 
dehydrogenases via veratraldehyde tot veratraat. Wanneer P. simplicissiumum op 
veratraat gekweekt werd, kon een NAD(P)H-afhankelijk veratraat-O-demethylase 
gemeten worden dat ook activiteit vertoonde met vanillaat en isovanillaat. Ringsplitsing 
van protocatechuaat gebeurde met een protocatechuaat-3,4-dioxygenase. Een 
217 Samenvatting 
interessant aspect aan P. simplicisslmum is de produktie van vanillyl alchol oxidase, 
een intracellular enzym met covalent gebonden FAD (hoofdstuk 9). Een SDS-PAGE 
plaatje van net 32-maal gezuiverde enzym liet een fluorescente band van 65 kDa zien. 
Gelfiltratie en sedimentatie-snelheid toonden aan dat het enzym normaal als een 
octameer voorkomt, met een flavine molecuul per subunit. De covalent gebonden 
prosthetische groep werd geidentificeerd als 8a-(A/3-histidyl)-FAD. Het enzym heeft een 
nauwe maar wel zeer bijzondere substraatspecificiteit. Naast vanillyl alcohol en 4-
hydroxybenzyl alcohol werden ook eugenol en chavicol geoxideerd (hoofdstuk 10). De 
produkten coniferyl en coumaryl alcohol zijn de natuurlijke bouwstenen voor de lignine 
in planten. Deze enzymatische reactie heeft een potentiele toepassing omdat nu 
coniferyl alcohol geproduceerd kan worden uit de goedkope, natuurlijke grondstof 
eugenol, de geurstof van kruidnagelen. Coniferyl alchol kan omgezet worden in vanille 
en het kan gebruikt worden voor de produktie van synthetisch lignine (DHP). 
218 NAWOORD 
Op de voorkant van dit proefschrift staat een close-up opname van de onderkant van 
de doolhofzwam. Alhoewel er met deze paddestoel geen experimenteel onderzoek 
verricht is, is dit vruchtlichaam niet alleen vanwege zijn fotogenieke uiterlijk gekozen 
voor de voorkant. Deze schimmel is namelijk een mooie metafoor voor 
wetenschappelijk onderzoek in zijn algemeenheid en promotieonderzoek in het 
bijzonder. Bij het begin van mijn onderzoek leek ik in een doolhof aangeland met tal 
van mogelijke onderzoekspaden die echter even zo vaak dood bleken te lopen. Zoals 
blijkt uit de resultaten, weergegeven in dit boekje, waren er echter ook paden die naar 
een, vaak onverwachte, uitgang leidden. Deze paden heb ik natuurlijk niet alleen 
gevonden en ik zou dan ook graag een aantal mensen bedanken die mij hierbij 
behulpzaam zijn geweest. 
Als allereerste ben ik Rick van der Zwan erkentelijk omdat hij het AlO-project 
heeft geschreven en mij gedurende het onderzoek altijd heeft gestimuleerd en de 
vrijheid heeft gelaten om nieuwe paden te onderzoeken, ook al liepen die niet altijd in 
de riching van het uiteindelijke doel, de biopulping van hout. 
Mijn promotoren Jan de Bont en Prof. Bol en co-promotor Jim Field wil ik 
bedanken voor het gestelde vertrouwen gedurende de promotietijd, de kritische blik 
op de manuscripten en de hulp bij de afronding van dit proefschrift. 
Floris de Vries voor de onovertroffen schimmel BOS55 en de prettige 
samenwerking, vooral ook op buitenlandse congressen. 
De studenten Evelien Beuling, Anne Cazemier, Ton Dings, Marco Fraaije, Serge 
Lochtman en Veronique Not voor de vele nieuw ge'fsoleerde schimmels uit het bos en 
de vele nuttige gegevens uit het laboratorium. 
Alle (ex-)medewerkers/sters van de sectie Industriele Microbiologie voor de 
onvergetelijke buitenlandse excursies, discussies, hulp, werkende apparatuur, 
219 Nawoord 
interesse in die gekke schimmels, vakgroepsvergaderingen, met bier zonder koffie, 
schuine buizen, enz, enz. 
Ook andere medewerkers van de landbouwuniversiteit waren mij altijd 
behulpzaam bij mijn onderzoek. Vooral de samenwerking met Willem van Berkel van 
de vakgroep Biochemie en Hans Wijnberg van de vakgroep Organische Chemie heb 
ik als zeer constructief en prettig ervaren. Verder wil ik Cees Teunis en Ab van 
Veldhuizen van de vakgroep Organische Chemie bedanken voor de analyses van de 
gechloreerde metabolieten, de afdeling fotografie en de mechanische werkplaats van 
de Centrale Dienst Biotechnion voor het geleverde vakwerk en het bureau buitenland 
van de LUW voor de begeleiding en afwikkeling van veldonderzoek in het buitenland. 
I also like to thank Eric Spinnler from the INRA in Dijon for the pleasant cooperation. 
Mijn ouders wil ik bedanken voor de mogelijkheden die ze mij geboden hebben 
en voor hun interesse in het paddestoelenonderzoek. ledere houtbewonende 
paddestoel in het bos werd gefotografeerd en daarna werd er in de boekjes 
nagegeken of het de gewenste wit-rotter was of toch weer zo'n bruin-rot schimmel. 
Zonder Judith waren de afgelopen jaren lang zo leuk niet geweest. Ook al was ik 
gedurende de laatste, ook anderzijds spannende, maanden 's avonds/'s nachts niet 
meer achter de computer weg te slaan. 
Tot slot wil ik al die andere mensen die niet met name genoemd zijn geworden, 
maar er toch voor gezorgd hebben dat de afgelopen jaren een onvergetelijke tijd is 
geworden, bedanken.
