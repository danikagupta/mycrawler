A Review of Serotonin Toxicity Data: Implications for
the Mechanisms of Antidepressant Drug Action
P. Ken Gillman
Data now exist from which an accurate definition for serotonin toxicity (ST), or serotonin syndrome, has been developed; this has also
lead to precise, validated decision rules for diagnosis. The spectrum concept formulates ST as a continuum of serotonergic effects,mediated by the degree of elevation of intrasynaptic serotonin. This progresses from side effects through to toxicity; the conceptemphasizes that it is a form of poisoning, not an idiosyncratic reaction. Observations of the degree of ST precipitated by overdoses ofdifferent classes of drugs can elucidate mechanisms and potency of drug actions. There is now sufficient pharmacological data onsome drugs to enable a prediction of which ones will be at risk of precipitating ST, either by themselves or in combinations with otherdrugs. This indicates that some antidepressant drugs, presently thought to have serotonergic effects in animals, do not exhibit sucheffects in humans. Mirtazapine is unable to precipitate serotonin toxicity in overdose or to cause serotonin toxicity when mixed withmonoamine oxidase inhibitors, and moclobemide is unable to precipitate serotonin toxicity in overdose. Tricyclic antidepressants(other than clomipramine and imipramine) do not precipitate serotonin toxicity and might not elevate serotonin or have a dualaction, as has been assumed.

Serotonin toxicity (ST), often referred to as serotonin syn-
drome (SS), is an iatrogenic drug-induced “toxidrome” (acontraction of the words toxic and syndrome). Toxidromes
consist of groups of signs and symptoms found together with aparticular type of poisoning. Serotonin toxicity displays thecharacteristics expected of a synaptic serotonin concentration–related phenomenon. The term ST is preferable because it ismore informative than SS. It has been pointed out that the termSS insinuates an idiosyncratic reaction, like neuroleptic malig-nant syndrome. This promotes misconceptions that have wide-spread and sometimes serious consequences. We have beenstruggling to recognize and understand ST for 50 years, since thefirst report (Mitchell 1955) and the first proposed explanation ofthe mechanism of raised intrasynaptic serotonin (Oates andSjoerdsma 1960). It is an important phenomenon because poten-tially fatal combinations of therapeutic drugs are still beingprescribed or accidentally combined and because there is mis-understanding about what drugs are able to precipitate it, thesymptoms, the pathophysiology, and the treatment. It is acomplex topic that spans many disciplines, and single reviewscannot provide a full perspective. Some other recent reviews arerecommended (Boyer and Shannon 2005; Dunkley et al 2003;Gillman 1998, 1999, 2004b, 2005a; Gillman and Whyte 2004;Isbister and Hackett 2003; Isbister et al 2003b, 2004; Nisijima et al2001, 2003; Parrott 2002; Shioda et al 2004; Whyte 2004b, 2004d,2004e; Whyte et al 2003).
Serotonin toxicity is one of the rare instances of drug inter-
action in clinical medicine whereby death can result from a singledose of a drug when errors are made, especially when nospecific treatment is given, as exemplified by a recent death in ateaching hospital (Otte et al 2003). The term SS continues to beused, sometimes imprecisely, to describe varying degrees ofseverity of side effects (Ubogu and Katirji 2003) from drugs thatdo not, and cannot, cause ST (Gillman 2003c; Isbister and Whyte
2003). Such erroneous reports are still being published inprominent journals (Haddow et al 2004) and continue to main-tain the confused and inaccurate understanding of this toxidrome(Gillman 2005b; Isbister and Buckley 2005). At the other extreme,cases of life-threatening ST, precipitated by ingestion of bothmonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) together, are not always receiving the
urgent and aggressive medical intervention that their predictablyserious consequences demand; these more severe reactions arepredicted by the spectrum concept of ST. We now know fromWhyte’s data that 25% of overdoses involving combinations ofmoclobemide and SSRIs will result in life-threatening ST; thedanger with the old MAOIs and SRIs is even higher.
Professor Whyte’s research group at the Hunter Area Toxicol-
ogy Service (HATS) in Newcastle, Australia, has maintained aprospective clinical database of all poisonings since 1987. Theevidence from the HATS series of 2222 serotonergic overdoseshas been published in a seminal series of articles (Dunkley et al2003; Isbister and Hackett 2003; Isbister et al 2003a, 2003b; Whyte
2004a, 2004d, 2004e; Whyte et al 2003). The availability of these datameans that unsystematic and incomplete observations from individ-ual case reports are unlikely to be of much further value.
The HATS data indicate that it is only the higher elevations of
serotonin resulting from MAOI plus SRI combinations that arelikely to induce hyperpyrexia and death. The HATS data alsoprovide information on the relative frequency and severity oftoxicity with different drugs, and this information is useful inrefining hypotheses about the actions of the drugs. These dataconsolidate the spectrum concept of ST; the strong evidencesupporting the existence of a clear “dose–effect” relationship,
mediated by the degree of elevation of intrasynaptic serotonin, isillustrated by the data in Table 1 and has been elaborated elsewhere(Gillman 1998; Isbister et al 2004; Whyte 2004d, 2004e; Whyte et al2003). There is a strong correlation between various different drugs’ability to raise serotonin levels in microdialysis studies in rats andthe appearance of signs of ST in both rats and humans.
The typical clinical features of ST in humans, derived from the
HATS data (Gillman and Whyte 2004; Isbister et al 2003b; Whyte2004d; Whyte et al 2003) are 1) neuromuscular hyperactivity:tremor, clonus, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia, and, in the ad-vanced stage, pyramidal rigidity; 2) autonomic hyperactivity:diaphoresis, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and mydriasis; and3) altered mental status: agitation and excitement, with confusion

presentation of patients can be found elsewhere (Boyer andShannon 2005; Gillman and Whyte 2004; Whyte 2004d). Whyteet al have applied classification and regression tree rules to theirlarge data set and found “ . . . only clonus (inducible, spontane-
ous or ocular), agitation, diaphoresis, tremor and hyperreflexiawere needed for accurate prediction of ST as diagnosed by aclinical toxicologist.” These rules are detailed in their seminalarticle (Dunkley et al 2003). They demonstrate clearly that if, inthe presence of a serotonergic agent, the single sign of sponta-neous clonus is present, then ST might be reliably diagnosed.
The Spectrum Concept of ST
Whyte, Gillman, and colleagues have elaborated the spectrum
concept of ST, with data from overdoses in humans (Dunkley etal 2003; Gillman 1997; Gillman and Whyte 2004; Isbister et al2003b; Whyte and Dawson 2000). This is substantiated byresearch in animals reviewed elsewhere (Gillman 1998), in whichserotonin levels have been elevated to a greater extent, produc-ing more severe ST, by administration of combinations (e.g.,MAOI plus L-tryptophan and MAOI plus SRI) than with singledrugs (Table 1). The spectrum concept formulates ST as aprogression of serotonergic effects mediated by the degree ofelevation of intrasynaptic serotonin. These range from serotonin-related side effects (at therapeutic doses) through to toxicityand culminate in death with MAOI/SRI combinations. Serotoninconcentrations become sufficiently elevated to cause severetoxicity (of a life-threatening degree) most commonly whencombinations of MAOIs and SRIs, or MAOIs and serotoninreleasers (e.g., amphetamine) are co-administered.
The evidence from the HATS database indicates that in
humans serotonergic signs become progressively more severewith increasing dose of an SSRI and that approximately 15% ofpeople who have taken an SSRI-alone overdose develop amoderate degree of severity of ST that will result in admission toa hospital and medical treatment. Overdoses of SSRIs alone donot usually result in severe ST or pyrexia in excess of 38.5°C(Isbister et al 2004). Indeed, only one patient in Whyte’s series of469 cases developed a temperature in excess of 38.5°C, and thereis only one case report in the known literature of an apparentSSRI-alone overdose causing more severe ST (temperature 40°C)(Olsen et al 2004). This suggests a ceiling effect on serotoninelevation for SSRIs.Implicated Drugs
Understanding ST as a form of poisoning and taking the
spectrum concept into consideration demonstrates the impor-tance of knowing the degree to which different drugs are capableof elevating brain serotonin (Table 1). Bayesian reasoning furtherelucidates this issue by emphasizing the importance of priorknowledge of the ingested drug in assessing the likelihood,severity, and type of poisoning (i.e., the toxidrome characteristicof a class of drugs) (Buckley et al 2002; Gill et al 2005). Whyte’sHATS data demonstrate that approximately 50% of patients whohave ingested mixtures of moclobemide and SRIs will exhibitmoderately severe ST; ingestion of such mixtures is the strongestpredictor of severe ST.
The three important mechanisms, in relation to severe ST, are
inhibition of reuptake, presynaptic release, and MAO inhibition.The therapeutic drugs so far implicated in severe reactions thatare capable of precipitating fatalities are the combination ofMAOIs with either SRIs or the only clinically available serotoninreleaser, amphetamine. Fenfluramine is no longer available inmost countries, and methylphenidate is not serotonergic: it doesnot elevate extracellular serotonin in rats (Kuczenski and Segal1997). A recent review of the human literature suggests that, ofthe releasers, amphetamine is a risk for ST with MAOIs, whereasmethylphenidate is not (Feinberg 2004). Amphetamine haspotency as a releaser, and methylphenidate does not (Rothmanand Baumann 2003). The illicit drug MDMA (3,4-methyl-enedioxymethamphetamine; Ecstasy) is a releaser and has thepotency to precipitate fatalities with MAOIs (Vuori et al 2003).The effect of MDMA is diminished by SRIs because they impedeits uptake into the presynaptic terminal, which prevents thereleaser effect (Mechan et al 2002).
There are some SRIs and MAOIs that doctors might not readily
recognize (e.g., sibutramine, imipramine, tramadol, meperidine(pethidine), chlorpheniramine, and linezolid). The degree of riskwith the new antibiotic linezolid is currently uncertain because oflimited data concerning its MAOI potency (Gillman 2003b), but itis currently clear that it is capable of inducing ST (with SRIs). Itis therefore essential to have an accurate table of drugs withinformation about the degree to which they are capable ofelevating serotonin. Tables 1 and 2 show this information for
therapeutic drugs.
Despite advances in pharmacology, there are still areas of
uncertainty; serotonin releasers, usually termed “indirectly actingTable 1. Comparative Degree of Serotonin Elevation by Different Drugs in Relation to ST

measure their potency, and uncertainty has remained about theinteractions and mode of action of some. The lack of informationconcerning the serotonergic potency of opioid analgesics re-mains a prominent area of incomplete data. Monoamine oxidaseinhibitor opioid interactions have been reviewed; some opioidsmight not act as reuptake inhibitors at all but as releasers(Gillman 2005a). There are few data other than that in Codd’sarticle (Codd et al 1995; Toll et al 1998) and none at all regardingtheir possible releaser potency.
Serotonin Toxicity in Relation to Mechanisms and
Potency of Drug Actions
Tricyclic Antidepressants
For the structurally homologous tricyclic antidepressants
(TCAs), the relationship between SRI potency and the ability toprecipitate fatalities in combination with MAOIs is robust. TheTCAs exhibit affinities at the human cloned serotonin transporter
that vary 1000-fold (Table 3). There has been discussion regard-ing which TCAs have significant effects on serotonin levels andwhether amitriptyline exhibits clinically relevant dual effects(Freemantle et al 2000; Thase 2003). Some evidence suggestingthat it does not has recently been summarized (Gillman 2003a).Thus, ST data provide insights into what might constitute mean-ingful serotonergic potency (cf. mirtazapine and mianserin [Gill-man 2003c, 2004a] and opioid analgesics [Gillman 2005a]). It issafe to combine amitriptyline with an MAOI without precipitatingserotonergic side effects or ST (Gillman 1998). If an overdose ofamitriptyline is taken, ST symptoms do not occur (Dawson 2004).Other TCAs with weaker SRI potency than amitriptyline are notassociated with ST, either in overdose by themselves or whencombined with MAOIs (Gillman 1998, 2003a; Whyte 2004c).Conversely, the more potent TCA SRI clomipramine has bothclinically relevant serotonergic effects (efficacy in obsessive-compulsive disorder, which other TCAs do not possess) andserotonergic effects in overdose (Whyte and Buckley 1995).Clomipramine is able to cause marked serotonergic side effectsand ST, as well as fatalities from ST if combined with MAOIs(Amsterdam et al 1997; Gillman 1998; Oefele et al 1986). Thesedata give an indication of what constitutes clinically meaningfulSRI potency in terms of Ki values (Table 3).
SSRIs (and Venlafaxine)
The HATS data demonstrate that approximately 15% of over-
doses of an SSRI alone exhibit moderate ST and that overdoses ofSSRIs do not cause life-threatening ST or pyrexia in excess of38.5°C, indicating a probable ceiling effect. Table 3 shows thatvenlafaxine is possibly anomalous, because its SRI potency, at Ki7.5–100 nmol/L, is less than amitriptyline (2.8–36 nmol/L), so itmight be expected to have a lesser risk for ST; however, itprecipitates ST even more frequently than SSRIs (30% vs. 15%;Whyte and Dawson 2000). There is evidence suggesting that itmight act other than as an SRI (Bamigbade et al 1997; Beique etal 1998); if that is so, it would be consonant with this discrep-ancy. There could be imprecision with the correlation betweenthese assays and actual SRI effects, and factors such as relativedose and tissue levels might explain the difference. Clomipra-mine overdose results in ST less frequently than SSRIs, perhapsbecause of its significant potency at serotonin 2A (5-HT2A)receptors; but it can still cause marked serotonergic side effects attherapeutic doses (Lejoyeux et al 1993). One possible explana-tion is that the ceiling for 5-HT2A antagonist effects is higher thanTable 2. Serotonergic Drugs

www.sobp.org/journalARTICLE  IN  PRESSfor SRI action, so 5-HT2A antagonism predominates and reduces ST
only when an overdose has been taken. Amitriptyline has potency
at 5-HT2A receptors similar to clomipramine but does not causemarked serotonergic side effects at therapeutic doses or ST inoverdose. This suggests that weaker SRI potency, rather than5-HT2A antagonism, might account for the absence of ST withamitriptyline/MAOI combinations.
It has been suggested that the risk of inducing ST might be
higher with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors thanwith SSRIs, especially when these are combined with a 5-HT1Aantagonist (Bjorvatn et al 2000). As more human toxicology dataaccumulate, it might be possible to address questions of relativetoxicity. Data on the relative risk with milnacipran, sibutramine,and duloxetine will be interesting, but in view of the lack ofsystematic human toxicology research, sufficient data are un-likely to be available for some time.
Moclobemide and Irreversible MAOIs
Moclobemide, a reversible competitive selective MAO-A in-
hibitor, does not precipitate ST in overdose by itself, nor does itproduce serotonergic side effects in clinical use. It is onlyimplicated in ST if it is combined with a drug that has significantSRI or releaser potency (Isbister et al 2003b). Isbister’s case seriesof 106 moclobemide overdoses from the HATS database revealedneither ST nor serotonergic signs in cases where moclobemidealone or moclobemide plus another nonserotonergic drug hadbeen ingested (85 cases). In the 21 cases where it had beeningested in combination with a serotonergic drug, however, 50%of cases exhibited ST, even though the other serotonergic drughad often been ingested only in therapeutic quantities, not as anoverdose. In 6 of these 21 cases, severe ST developed withtemperature /H1102238.5°C and muscle rigidity, requiring intubation,
paralysis, and 5-HT2A antagonists.
These effects are consonant with moclobemide’s low potency
to elevate serotonin levels in rats (Table 1). The degree ofelevation of serotonin with moclobemide is substantially lessthan with SSRIs, and the relationship between this and seroto-nergic side effects is clear. The old irreversible nonselectiveMAOIs, such as tranylcypromine, cause definite ST in overdose,exhibiting hyperpyrexia and fatalities (Whyte 2004a). This againfits with their greater ability to elevate serotonin levels in rats.The correlation between these variables with different classes ofdrugs is summarized in Table 1, which shows that order ofmagnitude effects are predictable for different types of drugs andcombinations with different mechanisms of action (SSRIs, MAOIsand releasers).
In contrast to modest antidepressant effects in clinical trials,
clinical experience and some trials suggest that moclobemidemight have a weaker antidepressant effects than other antide-pressants (Danish University Antidepressant Group 1993). Oneof the possible interpretations of this is that greater elevations ofserotonin than moclobemide is able to produce are required foroptimal antidepressant effects. Such observations might help toclarify the degree of elevation of serotonin levels that is requiredto help depression.
Some reviews have suggested that moclobemide is a safe and
viable treatment when combined with SSRIs (Bonnet 2003;DeBattista et al 1998). The risks of such combinations have beensummarized (Gillman 2004b). The data in Table 1 suggest theprobability that the degree of elevation of serotonin with thecombination is such that toxicity might be expected. Severalpreliminary studies of combining moclobemide with SSRIs werepublished nearly 10 years ago, the largest being by Hawley(Hawley et al 1996). Hawley decided to stop his research
because of high levels of moderately severe serotonergic sideeffects, especially with moclobemide plus venlafaxine. A detailedaccount of interactions between moclobemide (and otherMAOIs) and SRIs is available (Gillman 2005c). No further re-search has been reported since, and no double-blind trials havebeen published, so there is currently no controlled evidence tosupport the antidepressant efficacy of this type of combination.In summary, these results suggest that the degree of elevation ofserotonin produced by moclobemide alone is insufficient foroptimal antidepressant efficacy, but that the greater elevationscaused by combining it with SSRIs can produce higher levels thatcan sometimes be excessive; unfortunately, the degree of anti-depressant effectiveness of these combinations remains uncer-tain. These interactions are complex, especially when pharma-cokinetic factors influence drug levels, which then have furtherpharmacodynamic interactions. The misunderstanding of druginteractions played a part in the demise of mixed treatmentregimens using the old MAOIs plus TCAs (Gillman 1998; Gillmanand Whyte 2004). Adequate trials of these various combinationshave not been undertaken, so valuable data concerning poten-tially effective treatments might remain undiscovered. Sargent’swords from 40 years ago are still worth noting: “We are nevergoing to learn how to treat depression in an MRC statistician’soffice” (Sargent 1965). Most current antidepressant agents pro-duce small improvements that require clarification with statistics,but only because the clinical effect is small. Sargent meant thatwhen the treatment effect is large, statistics become a refinementrather than a necessity.
The older irreversible MAOIs do exhibit greater potency for
inducing ST, but there are no systematic data on the comparativerisk versus moclobemide. There is no doubt that MAOI-aloneoverdoses are more dangerous than moclobemide-alone over-doses (see Table 1). The limited case series available give astrong indication of greater toxicity, and these data have beenreviewed elsewhere (Gillman 1998). Also, clinical experienceand extrapolation from the animal evidence available makes italmost certain that they are substantially more prone to precipi-tate ST.
Other Antidepressants
Trazodone and nefazodone are primarily 5-HT2A antagonists,
although their mechanism of antidepressant action, if any, isuncertain. They neither exhibit serotonergic side effects norinduce signs of ST in overdose alone (Isbister and Hackett 2003).The absence of ST when they are combined with MAOIsindicates that they have no clinically significant SRI potency(Table 1) and probably do not significantly elevate serotoninlevels by any mechanism (Gillman 2003c, 2004a). They mighthave weak antidepressant effects and are rarely used as first-linetreatment: trazodone is used as a hypnotic, and nefazodone hasnow been withdrawn.
Mirtazapine has been described and marketed as a noradren-
ergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant and has beenpresumed to have dual action (Blier 2001; Gupta et al 2003;Montgomery 1999; Tran et al 2003); however, this assumption ispredicated on animal experiments that have demonstrated eithersmall increases in serotonin (and norepinephrine) or no increaseat all (Bengtsson et al 2000). Selective SRIs increase extracellularserotonin to a greater degree (see Table 1). Consideration ofmirtazapine in relation to ST demonstrates that it neither exhibitsserotonergic side effects nor induces signs of ST in overdose(Buckley and Faunce 2003). In addition, the apparent absence of
4BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2006;xx:xxx P.K. Gillman

has no significant serotonergic effects.
Toxicity Data
Toxicity data are infrequently published and might be un-
available to researchers outside the industry (Buckley andFaunce 2003). Median lethal dose data would assist significantlyin assessing the relative degree of ST exhibited, and especially inindicating whether it is possible for any of these drugs to causeST fatalities in rats. Systematically collected toxicity data fromcases of overdoses of drugs in humans are not recorded orcollated on a large scale or national basis; the HATS databaseseems to be unique.
Conclusion
Serotonin toxicity has now been a clinical problem for 50
years. The progress made in understanding it and the implemen-tation of that knowledge into clinical teaching and practicereflects many factors, among which is the difficult and complexinterdisciplinary nature of the topic. It is a drug-induced mani-festation of raised intrasynaptic serotonin; therefore, the degreeof severity and risk of fatality is related to the extent of serotoninelevation, which depends on the potency and admixture of theserotonergic drugs precipitating it (Table 1). It is a sine qua nonthat a drug must be capable of large elevations of serotonin if itis to induce ST; drugs like moclobemide and mirtazapine do notelevate serotonin sufficiently and ipso facto cannot cause ST.
There is room for further work in the area of postmarketing
surveillance and human toxicology, but these must be systemat-ically collected data: individual case reports have hindered ratherthan helped understanding in this field. This incompleteness ofpublished drug toxicity and interaction data is impeding re-search. This article attests to the importance of studies on ST,which will help to improve understanding of both the mecha-nisms of drug action and disease pathophysiology. Their valuefor drug research and development might be underrecognized.Some antidepressant drugs presently assumed to have serotoner-gic effects, such as mirtazapine and moclobemide, might haveinsufficient potency to induce optimal effects in humans.
There is also a gap in the literature resulting from the paucity
of experimental animal data, and there is much information to beobtained that would be of value when fed back into models ofdrug action.
