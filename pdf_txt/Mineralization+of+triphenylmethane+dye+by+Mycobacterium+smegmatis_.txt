          ABSTRACT                         
Introduction  
Crystal violet is a triphenylmethane dye 
which is commonly used in the clothing 
industry to dye wool, silk and cotton (Kim 
et al., 2005).While knowledge of the genes 
and enzymes involved in the biodegradation 
of this dye is restricted; the mechanistic 
pathway of its break down is well 
understood. Yatome and colleagues (1993) 
were the first to elucidate the degradation of 
crystal violet by Nocardia sp., identifying 
the main product as Michlers  ketone.    
Chen and   coworkers (2007) were able to      elucidate the biodegradation pathway of 
crystal violet by Pseudomonas putida and 
concluded that the dye is broken down by 
demethylation. Similarly, Kumar and 
colleagues (2011) found that Aspergillus 
sp. decolorized methyl violet using the 
same mechanism.Jang and colleagues 
(2005) were the   first to   report on the   
cloning of  a triphenylmethane reductase 
gene (TMR) isolated from the Gram 
negative Citrobacter sp. KCTC 18061P.The 
sequence did not show similarity to proteins 
of known functions hence they proposed that ISSN: 2319 -7706 Volume 2 Number 6 (2013) pp. 41-56

An Amycolatopsis species isolate was found to break down two structurally 
distinct dyes, one of which is crystal violet. This study aimed to identify the genes 
involved in triphenylmethane dye biodegradation. A library was constructed and 
four genes were isolated and identified as3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate  synthase, 
N5, N10- methylenetetrahydro methanopterin reductase, polycystic kidney domain 
I and glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase. Gene expression was conducted in the 
host species Streptomyces lividans. The synergistic action of the segenes led to 
complete crystal violet decolorization. Additionally, the activity of these genes was 
tested in two other bacterial species, namely Mycobacterium sp. and Rhodococcus 
sp. The range of dye classes decolorized was extended in both species, showing 
that the segenes adopted novel functional potentials within these hosts.  Int.J.Curr.Micr obiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(6): 41-56

the enzyme is a novel class of the short-
chain dehydrogenase reductase family. Kim 
and coworkers (2008) predicted the 
mechanism of action of the reductase on 
malachite green through crystallization 
experiments linked to structure-function 
analysis studies. These researchers were 
able to workout which amino acids and 
atoms are involved at each stage of the 
decolorization process. Similarly, only one 
study documenting a gene responsible for 
triphenylmethane dye mineralization in a 
Gram positive species was recently 
conducted. The fbi C gene from M. 
smegmatis, which encodes a7,8-didemethyl-
8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (FO) synthase 
involved in the biosynthesis of electron 
carrier coenzyme F420 was linked to this 
activity (Guerra-Lopez et al., 2007).   
Since dye effluent normally contains an 
array of dye classes (and thus structures) the 
effective treatment of this waste water 
would need to include microbes with the 
ability to degrade numerous structurally 
diverse dyes. In light of this we isolated a 
potent crystal violet degrader, identified the 
genes involved and through heterologous 
expression of these genes demonstrated that 
it is possible to increase the range of 
substrate degradation not present in the 
original host.    
Materials and Methods  
Chemicals  
The dyes used in this study include 
eriochrome black T, orange II, congo red, 
crystal violet, amido black, fast green, 
biebrich scarlet, ponceau S, janus green, 
bismarck brown Y, brilliant green, 
tartrazine, amaranth, basic fuchsin and 
malachite green purchased from Saarchem, 
South Africa.   Bacterial strains and vectors   
The bacterial stra ins and vectors used in this 
study are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.   
Isolation of dye decolorizing organisms  
Decolorization was detected on minimal 
media agar plates containing (L): stock III 
(x10) 100ml; NH4Cl2 1g; agar 15g 
supplemented with relevant dye (10 g/ml) 
and glucose (0.25%). Bacteria were spotted 
onto the plates using a replicator and 
incubated at 30oC. The plates were 
monitored continuously over a period of 7 
days and viewed above a white light 
illuminator. The detection of clear zones 
surrounding the colonies was recorded as 
decolorization.       
Decolorization assay  
Decolorization experiments in liquid culture 
were carried out in test tubes containing 5 
ml of stock III liquid (x1) containing (g/L): 
K2HPO4. 3H2O 9.17g; KH2PO42.68g; 
MgSO 40.1g in addition to the appropriate 
dye/s (10 g/ml) and carbon source (0.25%). 
The inoculum was prepared by growing the 
strains in complex media till an OD600 of 2 
was obtained. This was washed three times 
in sterile distilled water and an equal volume 
added to each of the test tubes and 
incubated . Decolorization was monitored 
spectrophotometrically by reading the 
decrease in absorbance of the supernatant at 
the absorbance maxima for each dye. 
Culture media was used to zero the 
spectrophotometer. 1 ml of the culture was 
microfuged to remove the bacterial pellet 
and the supernatant added to an absorbance 
cuvette (A). Uninoculated controls were 
included to determine the initial absorbance 
(A0). All experiments were carried out in 
inter    experimental    duplication    and  an  Int.J.Curr.Micr obiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(6): 41-56

prior to inoculation for decolorization 
experiments.  
DNA manipulations  
Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase 
were purchased from MBI Fermentas and 
used according to the manufacturers 
protocol.    
Genomic DNA isolation  
Genomic DNA was isolated using the  
method of Pospiech and Neumann (1995) .  
Streptomyces sp. PEG mediated 
transformation  
The procedure of Dabbs and colleagues 
(1990) was followed with the following 
modifications: S. lividans TK23 was grown 
in 10 ml LBSG containing (g/L): tryptone 
10 g, yeast extract 5 g, sodium chloride 5 g, 
glycine 5 g, sucrose 100 g for 36-40 h. Cells 
were incubated in 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 
min. Protoplasts were regenerated on R2YE 
plates (g/L): tryptone 12 g, yeast extract 6 g, 
sodium chloride 3.6 g, sucrose 123.6 g, 
glucose 4 g, magnesium chloride 4 g, agar 
22 g, TES (5.73 %) 40 ml, mono potassium 
phosphate (0.5 %) 12 ml, calcium chloride 
24 ml and incubated for 18 h before 
performing a thiostrepton (30 µg/ml) 
antibiotic overlay.  Heterologous expression of genes in 
Rhodococcus sp.  
The crystal violet decolorizing gene 
fragments  obtained from the genomic library 
were ligated into the unique BglII site of the 
Rhodococcus sp. replicon vector pDA71. 
The recombinant vector was transformed 
into R. erythropolis SQ1 using the method 
of Dabbs et al., (1990).    
Heterologous expression of genes in 
Mycobacterium sp.  
The crystal violet decolorizing gene 
fragments obtained from the genomic library 
were ligated into the unique BamHI site of 
the Mycobacterium sp. replicon vectors, 
pNV18 and pNV19 and transformed 
according to the method of Hatfull and 
Jacobs (2000) into M. smegmatis  mc2 155.   
Construction of Streptomycete - E.coli 
shuttle vector  
The method of Hill et al., (1989) was 
followed to reconstruct pLR591.   
Constructionand screeningof genomic 
libraries  
Genomic DNA was partially digested with 
BglII and the fragments ligated to pLR591 
cleaved at the unique BglII site. These were 
transformed into S.lividans TK23 using 
PEG-mediated transformation. 
Transformants were patched onto minimal 
media plates supplemented with crystal 
violet (10 g/ml) and glucose (0.25%). 
Plates were incubated for 2 weeks and 
routinely analyzed for zones of clearing.    Int.J.Curr.Micr obiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(6): 41-56

Sequencing of inserts  
Gene fragments were excised from pLR591 
and ligated into the BamHI site of pUC18 
and sequenced using a Spectromedix LCC 
sequencer in conjunction with an ABI 
BigDye Terminator v3.1 sequencing kit.  
Detoxification analysis  
The supernatant , decolorized following 
incubation of the dye with A. orientalis, was 
transferred to Eppendorf tubes and 
microfuged in order to pellet the cells. The 
supernatant was then collected and passed 
through a sterile 0.25 µm filter. Five ml of 
this was transferred to a test tube and 10 µl 
of a stationary phase (OD600 = 1) E. coli 
culture added. The E. coli inoculum was 
prepared by growing the strain in Luria-
broth overnight and washed prior to 
inoculation. The controls included the use of 
non-supplemented minimal media and 
minimal media to which glucose (0.25%) 
was added. An appropriate volume of E. coli 
cells was added to each test tube and all 
were incubated for 2 h  on a rotating wheel at 
37oC. Following the incubation, a serial 
dilution was carried out and plated onto LA 
media (g/L): tryptone 10 g; yeast extract 5 g; 
sodium chloride 5 g; agar 15 g. This was 
incubated overnight and the colony forming 
units per ml determined .  
Thin layer chromatography (TLC)  
TLC was conducted as described by Jang et 
al., (2005). This was used to visually detect 
the break down of crystal violet.  
Nucleotide and pro tein sequence matches  
Protein and DNA sequences were matched 
using the blastx and nucleotide blast facilities of NCBI EntrezPubmed. Default 
parameters were used in both cases.   
Result and Discussion  
Dye decolorization  
A. orientalis SY6 was added to minimal 
media containing crystal violet as the sole 
carbon source. This strain demonstrated a 
potent decolorizing ability and clearing of 
the dye was visible just five minutes after 
incubation with the isolate 
(Figure.1).Acclimatization of  SY6 showed 
that the  strain could improve its 
decolorization capacity up to 30µg/ml of the 
dye, however even prolonged incubation 
showed no ability to decolorize beyond this 
concentration. Results were monitored on 
thin layer chromatography in 5, 10, 20, 30 
and 60 min. intervals (Table 3). At5 min. a 
dramatic decrease in   intensity was 
observed; its monitoring on TLC against 
untreated crystal violet confirmed this 
extreme degradation. Four main bands were 
observed from 5-20min.The lowest band 
was no longer visible at 30 min. and both 
lower bands were not detected at 60 min.

Figure.1 Mineralization of crystal violet 
(10µg/ml) by strainSY6. Tube on the left 
represents the dye only control and the tube 
on the right was inoculated with strainSY6, 
following 20 min. incubation.   
The possibility of extracellular enzymatic 
reduction was eliminated by adding dye to 
the cell free extracellular supernatant and 
the cofactors NADH and NAD(P)H (if the 
enzyme is cofactor dependent) and 
analyzing the decolorization percentage 
during prolonged incubation; an in 
significant decrease was indicative of 
cellular related mineralization.  
Combined dyes decolorized by 
A.orientalis SY6  
The range of decolorization by 
strainSY6extendedtoseveral 
triphenylmethane dyes other than crystal 
violet such as brilliant green, basic fuchsin 
and malachite  green. Since the isolate   was 
capable  of degrading  these dyes 
individually, it was investigated whether a 
combination of these colorants would also 
be easily decolorized (Figure. 2).The 
isolated is played  a remarkable ability to 
decolorize the combined triphenylmethane 
dyes just as effectively as that of a single triphenylmethane dye. Since it could also 
decolorize amido black and janus green 
individually we tested whether the addition 
of these to the combination of 
triphenylmethane dyes could also be 
decolorized.   
Comparison of strain SY6 dye 
degradation to R. erythropolis and M. 
smegmatis strains  
The rapid  degradation of crystal violet by 
M. smegmatis and R. erythropolis closely 
matched that of strain SY6.The decolorized 
supernatant of both strains was run on TLC 
and the Rf values calculated for the 
observed bands. Similar banding patterns 
and correspondingly Rfvalues were obtained 
for all three strains (Table 4).

A.orientalisSY6 0.79;0.68;0.57  
Detoxification of crystal violet by A. 
orientalis  SY6  
Strain SY6 decolorized the dye into a 
colorless derivative, however the toxicity of 
the by- products generated needed to be 
determined. This was done by monitoring 
the growth of an indicator strain, E. coli in 
the presence of the decolorized media. 
Inhibition of the strain was taken as a sign 
of toxicity. The colony forming units (CFU) 
per ml of E. coli in the decolorized 
supernatant closely matched that of the 
media supplemented with a carbon source 
Int.J.Curr.Micr obiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(6): 41-56   
47 
and was two times higher than non-
supplemented media (Figure. 3). This 
reflects no inhibition of the strain and thus 
complete detoxification.  
Creation of genomic library of                        
A. orientalis  SY6  
In order to isolate the genes responsible for 
decolorizing crystal violet a genomic library 
was created. The partial digestion of A. 
orientalis SY6 DNA with BglII yielded an 
average DNA fragment size of 
approximate ly 3800 bp. Calculations 
estimated that less than 7000 clones were 
needed to ensure a high probability of 
containing the genes of interest. A positive 
selection library was created, meaning the 
transformable host S. lividans TK23 did not 
have the ability to grow on crystal violet at 
a low cell inoculum. Hence, any clones that 
were found to survive on the dye plates 
were screened. Following the patching of 
approximately 5000 clones, ten colonies 
displaying a resistance to the 
triphenylmethane dye were isolat ed.  
Screening and isolation of clones capable 
of crystal violet decolorization  
A plasmid DNA extraction was conducted 
on all ten clones, of which three carried 
inserts. These clones were named SlivCV2, 
SlivCV4 and SlivCV6 and the DNA carried 
referred to as pCV2, pCV4 and pCV6 
respectively. S. lividans clones CV2, CV4 
and CV6 carried ~ 600 bp, > 2000 bp and > 
2000 bp gene fragments respectively.  
Decolorization by combined SlivCV 
clones  
The individual incubation of CV clones in crystal violet showed evidence of partial  
decolorization. Noticeably, the dye was 
removed from the media, however visually 
it was evident that it adhered to the cell wall 
of the bacteria. Unexpectedly, it was the 
combination of all three clones that led to 
the complete decolorization of the 
triphenylmethane dye. Two clones were 
combined in various combinations in order 
to assess if the eliminated clone was 
required for complete mineralization. The 
elimination of any of the clones resulted in 
partial decolorization.  
Sequence identif ication of CV clones  
Insert sequences were compared against the 
NCBI PubMed database, revealing the 
results shown in Table 5. Insert CV2 
showed high sequence identity to a DAHP 
synthase. Insert CV4 carried two genes 
namely a methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and 
reductase related protein. In insert CV6 a 
glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase and PKD 
domain occurred at the beginning of the 
fragment followed by five LGFP repeats 
located at the end of the fragment.  
Range of dyes decolorized by combined 
clones  
The decolorization activity of the clones 
was determined in the presence of other 
dyes. Other than crystal violet the SlivCV 
clones were able to decolorize three 
sulfonated  azo dyes, namely amaranth, 
ponceau S and biebrich scarlet (Table 6). 
Although congo red and eriochrome T were 
removed from the media they remained 
tightly bound to the  cell wall of the strains. 
The pCV2, pCV4 and pCV6 recombinant 
vectors were transformed into a 
Rhodococcus sp. host and referred to as 
SQ1CV2, SQ1CV4 and SQ1CV6 Int.J.Curr.Micr obiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(6): 41-56   
48 
respectively. The host strain into which the 
DNA was transformed possessed the ability 
to decolorize four of the five 
triphenylmethane dyes, as did the clones, 
hence it was not possible to evaluate 
whether any contribution was made by the 
expressed genes. Instead dyes which the 
original host could not decolorize were 
concentrated on. The SQ1CV clones 
additionally decolorized the sulfonated dyes 
amido black, orange II and biebrich scarlet 
(Table 6). Notably, this was not similar to 
the pattern of decolorization when in the S. 
lividans host. The pCV2, pCV4 and pCV6  
recombinant vectors were transformed into 
a Mycobacterium sp. host and referred to as 
155CV2, 155CV4 and 155CV6 
respectively. The combined 155CV clones 
were able to decolorize amido black, 
bismarck brown and janus green (Table 6). 
Again this was slightly different to the 
expression of the genes in the latter and 
former strains. In the United States, three classes of dyes 
are classified as harmful, these include  
triphenylmethane, azo and anthraquinone 
dyes (Guerra -Lopez et al., 2007). This study 
focused on the triphenylmethane class of 
dyes. Prior to this just two Gram positive 
species were linked with the ability to 
degrade crystal violet, hence it was assumed 
that this was a rare trait (Guerra-Lopez et 
al., 2007; Sani and Banerjee, 1999). 
However, when screening known isolates 
from our laboratory genetics culture 
collection it was surprising to find that this 
ability is in fact common among 
Rhodococcus sp., Mycobacterium sp. and 
Gordonia  sp. The strains displaying a pot ent 
crystal violet decolorization capacity 
include R. rhodochrous RI8, R. erythropolis 
SQ1, R. opacus HLPA1, M. smegmatis mc2 
155, G. rubripertincta 25593 and A. 
orientalis SY6. Of these strains SY6 was 
chosen for supplementary genetic screening.

In general, it was noticed that bacteria 
capable of decolorizing crystal violet were 
also able to mineralize other 
triphenylmethane dyes such as malachite 
green, brilliant green and basic fuchsin. 
This allows for the speculation that the 
enzymes responsible for triphenylmethane 
class degradation are either more lenient in 
their substrate interactions or the dye 
structural differences are minor and hence 
easier to accommodate. These results can be 
paralleled to those of the TMR 
(triphenylmethane reductase) enzyme 
isolated from Citrobacter sp.; malachite 
green was found to fit most favorably into 
the catalytic region of TMR, however the 
additional dimethylamino group in crystal 
violet produced a less favorable interaction 
while the positively charged amino groups 
in basic fuschin were problematic (Kim et 
al., 2008).  
Strain SY6 was able to decolorize the azo 
dyes amido black, janus green and several 
triphenylmethane dyes effectively. Results 
confirmed that the combination of four 
triphenylmenthane dyes were efficiently 
decolorized to colorless derivatives. This 
suggests that the same enzyme/s could be 
involved in the reduction of all these dyes. 
The addition of the azo dyes amido black 
and janus green did not affect the 
decolorization ability. Notably, the 
decolorization percentages represented on 
the graph give the impression that the 
addition of the azo dyes reduced the overall 
decolorization. However, amido black and 
janus green are not reduced to colorless 
derivatives. Amido black is decolorized to a 
violet colored compound and janus green is 
reduced to diethylsafranine which remains 
pink in suspension (Lazarow and 
Cooperstein, 1953). Since the 
decolorization percentage corresponds to 
that of the individually reduced azo dyes 
this showed that the multiple dyes were effectively broken down. Similarly, Sani 
and Banerjee (1999) demonstrated the 
potent ability of Kurthia sp. to completely 
decolorize five 2µM triphenylmethane dyes 
in just 30 minutes.  
The analysis of treated crystal violet by 
strains A. orientalis SY6, R. erythropolis 
SQ1 and M. smegmatis mc2 155 on thin 
layer chromatography showed that similar 
band patterns occurred. Thus, it is probable 
that the same degradative pathway is 
present in all three strains. However, since 
the exact pathway has not been uncovered 
in any of these strains it is difficult to 
determine what end products are being 
produced. It was observed that following 
prolonged incubation, the two upper bands 
remained in the supernatant. From the 
literature we can deduce the possibility of 
one of these products being Michlers 
ketone which researchers found can remain 
stably in the media for 100 hours and in 
some instances can not be catabolized 
further (Chen et al., 2008; Yatome et al., 
1993). The other product is likely to be 
leucocrystal violet which was reported in 
Citrobacter sp. as being the first product 
into which the dye was rapidly reduced 
(Jang et al., 2005). The lower bands which 
are only present in the early stages are 
likely to be derivatives of both or one of 
these compounds formed through reductive 
splitting or demethylation (Chen et al., 
2008); its disappearance reflecting its 
metabolism by the isolate.  
Results suggest that the decolorized 
triphenylmethane dye was fully detoxified 
by strain SY6. Chen and coauthors (2008) 
tested the decolorized supernatant of 
Shewanella sp. and found that it was not 
completely detoxified. However, these 
researchers used cell cultures which are 
more sensitive than the testing of bacterial 
resistance (Scribner et al., 1980). Int.J.Curr.Micr obiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(6): 41-56   
52 
Microbial decolorization can be attributed 
to either adsorption to the cell or 
biodegradation (Isik and Sponza, 2003). 
Investigation into the decolorization 
capacities of the individual SlivCV clones 
in liquid media was disappointing. 
Noticeably, the dye adsorbed onto the cell 
wall, indicative of incomplete 
biodegradation. Kalme and coauthors 
(2007) measured the activities of several 
enzymes during the degradation of direct 
blue- 6 by Pseudomonas desmolyticum . 
They found a significant increase in the 
oxidative enzymes, laccase and tyrosinase 
till complete decolorization at 96 hours, 
while reductase activities were only 
increased later after 48 hours. This inferred 
the synchronized working of collective 
genes involved in the biodegradative 
process. This is in contrast to other 
publications which have identified a single 
gene involved in dye breakdown (Jang et 
al., 2005; Guerra-Lopez et al., 2007). The 
attainment of unfavorably low 
decolorization rates using individual clones 
made us evaluate the possibility of several 
gene products working together to break 
down the dye. Correspondingly, the clones 
were combined and the extent of 
degradation monitored. By combining the 
strains it was noticed that the dye was 
completel y removed from the media and the 
cells retained their original color, indicative 
of complete mineralization.  
These clones were added in different 
combinations to establish the minimal 
number required for complete 
mineralization. It was evident that all three 
clones were required, however it was 
noticed that the contribution of each clone 
to the process of decolorization was 
unequal. A definite hierarchy was observed; 
the absence of SlivCV2 was the most 
profound, this was followed by SlivCV4 
and SlivCV6 (da ta not shown). The sequencing of the inserts from the 
recombinant vectors led to the identification 
of a DAHP synthase, methylmalonyl-CoA 
mutase, N5, N10 methylene- 
tetrahydromethanopterin reductase and a 
LGFP repeat containing protein with an 
associated d ehydrogenase.  
With no immediate relevant functionality 
observed with regard to the DAHP 
synthase, the pathway of the enzyme was 
looked at for an indirect mechanism of 
action resulting from the by-products or 
associated enzymes. The main involvement 
of DAHP synthase is the biosynthesis of 
phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan 
through the shikimate pathway. This 
pathway is controlled by several enzymes 
with DAHP synthase catalyzing the first 
step through the condensation of D-
erythrose 4-phosphate and 
phosphoenolpyruvate to form DAHP 
(Dosselaere and Vanderleyden, 2001). 
Through seven metabolic steps this is 
converted to chorismate which acts as the 
precursor for phenylalanine, tyrosine and 
tryptophan as well as many other diverse 
compounds, which include cofactors, 
coenzymes, phenazines and siderophores 
(Dosselaere and Vanderleyden, 2001). The 
DAHP synthase isolated in this study was 
most closely related to a class II synthase 
encoded by aroF in A. mediterranei. Hence, 
we looked closely at the reactions taking 
place along this pathway to the production 
of tyrosine and identified potential enzymes 
and thus biochemical reactions which could 
potentially interact with or influence the dye 
substrate. Three enzymes were identified, 
namely chorismate synthase which is 
catalyzed by a reduced flavin nucleotide 
cofactor supplied by an associated reductase 
(Herrmann, 1995), chorismate mutase 
which possesses dehydrogenase or 
dehydrolase activity and shikimate 
dehydrogenase which possesses the latter Int.J.Curr.Micr obiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(6): 41-56   
53 
activity as well (Qamra et al., 2006). 
Dehydrogenase activity has  been identified 
in anaerobic bacteria and linked to the 
decolorization of azo dyes (Rafii and 
Cerniglia, 1995). A dehydrolase can possess 
an esterase activity (Akashi et al., 2005), the 
relevance to this is that Bafana and 
Chakrabarti (2008) by computational 
methods were able to identify acyl carrier 
protein phosphodiesterases as potential azo 
dye reductases.  
Even though a reductase was present on 
pCV4, the vitamin B12 dependent 
methylmalonyl CoA mutase could not 
immediately be eliminated as playing a role 
in dye decomposition. The B12- dependent 
methylmalonyl -CoA mutase (mcm) 
catalyzes the conversion of succinyl-CoA 
into methylmalonyl-CoA (Gruber and 
Kratky, 2001). Once again the 
comprehensively studied enzyme structure 
and pathway were looked at to determine 
relevant reactions that could influence dye 
break down. The crystal structure of mcm 
revealed the presence of a TIM barrel 
domain, which differs from conventional 
barrel domains that are hydrophobic and 
large (Gruber and Kratky, 2001). The mcm 
barrel domain is hydrophilic and small; 
offering just enough space for the coenzyme 
end of the substrate to bind along the axis. 
From this it was conceded that the substrate 
specificity of mcm is rigid, therefore we 
propose no direct interaction of the mutase 
with crystal violet.  
The N5, N10 - methylene -
tetrahydromethanopterin reductase (mer) 
was originally isolated from 
Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum 
and Methanopyrus kandleri. This gene 
plays a role in the pathway conversion of 
carbon dioxide to methane and is a F420 
dependent reductase. From this we propose 
that the mer reductase is probably linked to crystal violet decolorization. This is further 
exemplified by the fact that a F 420 
dependent enzyme was linked to malachite 
green mineralization in M. smegmatis 
(Guerra-Lopez et al., 2007).  
LGFP repeat containing proteins are not 
well characterized; however one study 
suggests that they act as anchors which 
attach the protein to the cell wall (Adindla 
et al., 2004). The PKDI domain has been 
identified in bacterial genomes in 
association with collagenases, chitinases 
and proteases. Orikoshi and coauthors 
(2005) set out to uncover the function of the 
PKD domain in relation to chitin 
degradation. Through site directed 
mutagenesis of key residues they 
demonstraed that the PKD associated 
domain within the chitinase A gene directly 
participates in the hydrolysis of chitin. This 
was a key article showing that the domain 
plays a direct role in the biodegradation 
process and does not merely act as a 
binding domain for substrates. 
Correspondingly, we hypothesize that the 
LGFP region allows for attachment to the 
cell wall, the PKD domain which occurs on 
the surface, binds to the substrate and via 
hydrolytic interaction with the dye is 
responsible for partial decolorization. 
Furthermore, the sorbosone dehydrogenase 
interacts with the dye via an oxidoreductive 
mechanism.  
The response of the combined clones was 
analyzed in azo, sulfonated azo and other 
triphenylmethane dyes. It was interesting 
that the expression of these genes led to 
variable results, depending on the host 
strain into which it was introduced. A 
homolog of N5, N10-
methylenetetrahydromethanopterin 
reductase occurs in M. tuberculosis, 
identified through the genome sequencing 
project, and through the KEGG pathway is Int.J.Curr.Micr obiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(6): 41-56   
54 
hypothesized to play a role in 1,1,1-
Trichloro -2,2-bis (4- chlorophenyl) ethane 
(DDT) degradation (Kanehisa et al., 2004). 
This gene is proposed to oxidize 4- 
chlorobenzaldehyde to 4- chlorobenzoate, 
the last step in the biodegradative pathway 
(Kanehisa et al., 2004). Thus we 
hypothesize that this oxidative activity is 
responsible for the decolorization of amido 
black, bismarck brown and janus green 
when pCV2 is introduced in Mycobacterium 
sp. In a Rhodococcu s sp., enzymes closely 
related to N5, N10-methylenetetra -
hydromethanopterin reductase were 
responsible for the biodegradation of 2,4,6-
trinitrophenol (commonly found in 
pesticides, dyes and explosives) (Heiss et 
al., 2002). These enzymes took on the role 
of hydride transferases. Thus, it is possible 
that its function in the transferal of hydride 
ions allows this gene to contribute towards 
the decolorization of amido black, orange II 
and biebrich scarlet. This study underscores 
that the expression of genes in other species 
can lead to a broader range of activity. 
Moreover, there is an added advantage in 
expressing the genes in for instance, 
Rhodococcus species. These resilient strains 
have been implicated in the biodegradation 
of pollutants such as oil and pesticides and 
are commonly found in polluted 
wastewaters and toxic environments, 
making them a more practical choice for use 
when considering large scale 
bioremediation (Hoshima et al., 2006 ; Shao 
and Behki, 1996).   
To our knowledge this is the first report of 
an Amycolatopsis sp. being implicated in 
crystal violet biodegradation and only the 
second report of the characterization of 
triphenylmethane decolorizing genes from a 
Gram positive bacterium. This isolate not 
only decolorized but detoxified the dye as 
well. This strains ability to rapidly breakdown a combination of 
triphenylmethane dyes within a short 
interval makes it a suitable candidate for 
further bioremediation work. The 
introduction of these genes into 
Rhodococcus sp. led to the creation of an 
improved consortium capable of 
decolorizing eight dyes. These results also 
indicate that it would be beneficial to start a 
trend in which genes are not only expressed 
in common species which are closely 
related but also tested in other species .
