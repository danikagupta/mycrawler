Abstract  :  Synthetic dyes still remain a popular choice in industrial sector for long time due to its stability and low cost. However 
natural colors are gaining attention this day which may be from plant, microbe or dead biomass. On the other hand, synthetic dyes are 
continuously imposing serious threat to the environment due to th eir toxic and hazardous nature. These dyes mainly create serious 
health problems in different animals including humans. Additionally, these dye molecules accumulate  in marine flora and fauna which 
undergoes bioaccumulation in fishes and ultimately reaches human plate.  As a result, mankind is getting bi directional attack from 
synthetic dyes in critical terms.  Triphenylmethane dyes  like malachite green, brilliant green etc. are popular choice in textile industry 
which generates a huge effluent which contami nates the water bodies. Now a day, different bioremediation approaches being made 
along with chemical methods to treat these effluents for better environment. These treatments also helping the irrigation sys tem to 
sustain and grow in contamination free env ironment. As a result,  agricultural lands are becoming more fertile and usable. However, 
more cost effective and new approaches are required to detoxify these dye effluents to overcome this environmental threat. Th is 
current review shall be helpful to unde rstand the problems associated with triphenylmethane dye usage and their possib le 
detoxification procedures in  detail.  
 
Key words  – Triphenylmethane dye , industrial effluent,  bioremediation , environment al pollution, flora and fauna . 
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
A large volume of water is used by the textile industry of which 90% is discarded as wastewater. This wastewater contains 
different ty pe of dyes. Dye is considered as one of the most awkward pollutants which not only imparts obnoxious color to the waste 
effluent but is also recalcitrant in nature (Mondal, Baksi & Bose, 2017). Dye waste is non - biodegradable and can be seen with naked 
eyes (Mojsov et al., 2016). The disposal of dye containing waste effluent causes serious environmental pollution that adversely affects 
all types of living organisms (Subhatra et al., 2013). Dyes prevent the penetration of sunlight which reduce the photosynth etic activity  
(Hassan  & Carr, 2018). It imposes a toxic effect on dissolved oxygen levels thus, affecting the entire aquatic ecosystem (Muhd 
Julkapli, Bagheri & Hamid, 2014). Dye adversely impacts on biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). 
Textile dyes  and their metabolites act as mutagenic, toxic, and carcinogenic agents (Aquino et al., 2014, Khatri et al., 2018).  They 
appear to cross the food chains, leading to biomagnification (Sandhya, 2010), so that species have a higher level of contamin ation at a  
higher trophic level relative to their prey (Newman, 2015) .  
The dye containing effluent emanating from the textile industries is considered as a major concern in the global economy as w ell 
as in daily lives. Currently, it is becoming one of the major cau ses of deterioration in the globe in terms of quality and quantity 
(Mondal, Baksi and Bose, 2017). The dye, and their stuffs contain composite mixture of organic and inorganic components (Fule kar, 
Wadgaonkar and Singh, 2013). Prior to 1800, dyes were prepa red from natural sources like vegetables, roots, insects, flowers, woods, 
etc. However, due to increasing need and demand for industrial dyes, industries are dependent on the synthetic dyes manufactu red 
from petrochemical sources. Because of their syntheti c nature, dye removal from the effluent is very tough, as they have a high degree 
of structural complexity (Morales -Alvarez et al., 2018).  
Dye removal has recently become an area of growing interest in science, as government regulation on the release of ha zardous 
waste is becoming more stringent. Different methods for the removal of dyes from industrial effluent are quite time consuming  and 
expensive with low performance, like specific coagulation, filtration, use of chemical flocculation and activated carb on have been 
employed (Verma, Dash and Bhunia, 2012). However these physiochemical methods are expensive and  produces large amount of 
sludge which result in a subordinate level of land pollution (Shah, 2013). For this reason, there is a demand for eco -friendly and 
inexpensive removal technique of the polluting dyes. Bioremediation, usually by bacteria is becoming an important sector for treating 
the industrial effluent. This method is more  eco-friendly, inexpensive, and has been reported as one of the best alternatives to the 
physiochemical methods (Banat et al., 1996; Shah, 2013). Probably, microbes such as fungi, bacteria, algae, yeast, have gaine d 
growing interests due to their cost -effectiveness, eco -friendly nature and their production of less sludge (K alyani et al., 2009). 
Bacterial removal of dye can be either anaerobic or aerobic (Pandey et al., 2007). Generally bacteria from different taxonomi c groups 
can attain various degrees of dye removal and process absolute mineralization of dyes under optimum conditions (Asad et al., 2007). 
Gentian violet (GV) is one of the important industrial dyes belonging to the triphenylmethane group and known for its mitotic  and 
mutagenic poisoning nature. GV has been used in topical applications in domestic animals and h umans and can be taken orally for the 
treatment of pinworms. It has the potential to manage fungal growth under various c onditions . GV is mixed to the domesticated birds 
feed to control mould, thus exposing the human inhabitants directly or indirectly to G V due to its considerable commercial and 
medical applications. In Chinese hamster CHO cells, the cytogenic toxicity of GV in vitro has been studied. It was expressed that this 
composite is a clastogen in vitro as well as mitotic poison. In other five diffe rent mammalian cell types its clastogenic properties were © 2020  JETIR November  2020 , Volume 7, Issue 11                                                        www.jetir.org (ISSN -2349 -5162)

 confirmed. Thus, the in vitro studies determined that, GV may be considered as a bio hazardous substances (Azmi, Sani and Ban erjee, 
1998).  
II. CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES  
CV is a common cationic dye that has been used extensively in various other commercial textile operations as a biological stain, 
dermatological agent, temporary hair colourant, dyeing cottons, wools  (Sheng fang 2010; Senthilkumaar et al.,  2006). It belongs to a 
class of organic co mpounds that are highly coloured and are collectively called triphenylmethane dyes. CV, which is a basic colourant 
with the molecular formula  C25H30N3Cl, is also known as hexamethyl pararos aniline chloride (Sharma et al.,  2011).  
Tris (4 -(dimethylamino) phenyl) methylium chloride,  is the IUPAC name for crystal violet,  which  in colour, is blue -violet. The 
melting point and freezing point of the  CV are respectively 205 and 40° C. It is highly soluble (13.78 per cent) in ethanol and less 
soluble (1.68 per cen t) in water. With strong oxidising agents and strong acids, CV is found to be stable and incompatible. It is 
sensitive to light and is combustible. The structure and colour of crystal violet, however, depends largely on the medium's p H and 
temperature, whi ch makes it an important acid -base indicator as well as  an outstanding dye (Shah et al.,  2013) . 
 
2.1 Uses and synthesis  
The crystal violet dye can be prepared in laboratory conditions in a variety of possible ways. However, Caro and Kern (1883) 
developed the original method, which includes the chemical reaction of dimethylaniline with phosgene to intermediate 4, 41 -bis 
(dimethylamino) benzophenone (Reinhardt andTravis 2000). In the presence of phosphorus oxychloride and hydrochloric acid, thi s 
intermediate  form was then reacted with an additional dimethylaniline.  Formaldehyde and dimethylene condensation are also 
synthesizable to produce a leuco -colorant which is a reduced Crystal violet , as shown in reaction 1(Gessn er and Mayer, 2002) .

Second, the coloured cationic form is oxidised to this colourless compound: (Manganese dioxide is a typical oxidising agent).

The commercial preparations of triphenylmethane dye crystal violet (gentian violet or hexamethylpararosaniline) are relatively 
purified mixture of three rosaniline dyes: pentamethylpararosaniline, hexamthylpararosaniline and tetramethylpararosaniline. Varying 
mixtures ar e produced by different methods of synthesis. Through several processes, the manufacturing process of this dye was 
carried out by oxidising the mixture of p -toluene and aniline. Arsenic acid, an oxidising agent is most commonly used. Nitrobenzene 
has also been used.  By the action of carbonyl chloride on N, N -dimethylaniline pure crystal violet ha s been made (Cook and Martin, 
1951).  
Triphenylmethane and closely related dyes are widely used as biological stains in food, silk, wood and cosmetic dyes (hair dy es). 
Brilliant blue  (FCF) is a nontoxic dye of which surgical markers are made of; they  typically contain 10% gentian violet as a solvent 
with 50% isopropanol. These dyes have been shown to decrease vascular activity, but they continue to be used to label conduits; The 
use of operative cutaneous markers to prevent implantation from twisting and kneading greatly affects the smooth muscle and 
endothelial function of (HSV) human saphenous vein (Eagle et al., 2011).  
Several studies recommended administration of triple dye solution (prepared from a mixture of gentian violet, brilliant green, and 
proflavine hemisulfate) to newborn's umbilical cord in reducing colonisation by Staphylococcus aureus (Dandona et al., 2017).  
Gentian violet was used to prevent infection in patients with burns and to control intestinal parasites in humans before the discovery 
of antibiotics (Norman et al., 2017). Gentian violet has been used as a blood additive to prevent blood transfusion transmiss ion of 
Chagas disease ( Saye et al., 2020). Crystal violet has been used in poultry feed as a fungal growth controlling agent. Due to its ability 
to control diseases such as saprolegniasis, this compound was used as a fishery medicine in China's aquaculture industry (Son g et al.,  
2020)  © 2020  JETIR November  2020 , Volume 7, Issue 11                                                        www.jetir.org (ISSN -2349 -5162)

2.2 Impact  on ecosystem  
By triggering the Eutrophication phenomenon that interrupts the penetration of sunlight to the bottom of the marine environment, 
the presence of effluent in the aquatic environment, such as oceans, lakes, rivers, seas ... and insufficient biodegradabilit y in typical 
ecological environments can demolish the essential conditions of individual environments. In aquatic envi ronments, dyes high in 
concentration inhibit respiration activities, sunlight penetration, and also disturb photosynthetic and biological processes (Hassan & 
Carr, 2018). Dye effluent has a major impact on the population of plants, as plants are the necess ary commercial products and are 
consumed by humans and animals, thus ultimately infecting the organs and creating life -threatening issues for humans and animals. In 
addition, plants may be used to determine the genetic toxicity of environmental pollutants as biosensors (Jadhav et al., 2010).  
Moreover, fluctuating pH, a high degree of coloration and high levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen 
demand (BOD), suspended solids (TSS), and total organic carbon (TOC) makes the presence of dyes in  effluents very specific.  
In addition, a long -term dye presence in watercourses induces the accumulation of dye in marine organisms and fish. Some of the 
dye effluents decompose, and the aquatic ecosystem may have a toxic influence on complementary hazardo us compounds (Carmen 
and Daniela 2012). It was found from previous studies that the presence of dye effluents and related pollutants can be transf erred to 
food in surface water (Tkaczyk and Kowalska 2016).

 III. BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT  
An interesting alternative is to remove dye from the biological treatment of wastewater pollutants because it is based on activated 
sludge containing various aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and green algae. Bacterial isolated e nzymes 
have been shown as an effective method for the treatment of dye effluents in recent studies (Hazirah et al., 2014). This method is 
ambiguous, divergent, and distinct for decolorization of indus trial waste (Anjaneyulu, Chary and Raj, 2005). The activity and 
adaptability of mi croorganisms are associated with the most crucial factors affecting the effectiveness of biological dye treatment 
removal (Chen et al., 2003). Dyes themselves are not biologically degraded because colored constituents are not used as a sou rce of 
nourishmen t by microorganisms. In Infield bioremediation and laboratory studies, microbial consortia have been used to clean up the 
effluent pollutant and usually believed that it is the most effective method. Therefore, bacteria express their complete degr adation 
capacity in optimal conditions; temperature, pH, and other supplements have a high effect on their growth (Mao et al., 2012).  
Biodegradation involves aerobic microorganisms that use molecular oxygen during the respiration process to reduce equivalent 
recept ors. In anaerobic environment conditions (hypoxic and anoxic environment), biodegradation also occurs, and the survival of 
microorganisms is possible as electron acceptors by using nitrates, sul fates, and carbon dioxide (Harris  et al., 1989). A low cost is  the 
main advantage of biological treatment, the discharge of non -toxic mineralization substances in small amounts, the production of 
sludge, and in contrast to Physico -chemical treatment, approximately 70% of the organic matter expressed by COD ᴄr can be 
converted into biosolids (Anjaneyulu et al., 2005).  
In large scale textile effluent treatment, activated sludge was the most used biological treatment, and biological aerated ph iltre 
(BAF) or trickling philtre is an alternative, removing 34 -44 percent of dy e color for various high dying loads of industrial effluents. 
Microorganisms are considered to be the most effective "weapon" against environmental pollution of triphenylmethane dye (Song  et 
al., 2020). There are several strains isolated from various sourc es (such as lakes, textile effluents, soil) of bacteria and fungi that have 
the ability to degrade or decolorize triphenylmethane dyes. The main microorganisms that allow biodegradation of organic 
compounds are bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces  microflavus , Aeromonas  Hydrophilia , Bacillus  subtilis , Bacillus  cetreus , Pseudomonas  
species, Klebsiella  pneunomoniae , Acetobacter  liquefaciens , Pagmentiphaga  kullae , Sphingomonas , etc. (Zimmerman et al., 1982;  
Sani and Banerjee, 1999), fungi (e.g., white -rot fungi: Hirschioporus  larincinus , Inonotus  hispidus , Phanerochaete  chrysosporium , 
Coriolus  versicolor , Phlebia  tremellosa , etc. (Gold and Alic, 1993; Swamy and Ramsay, 1999; Balan and Monteiro, 2001; Novotny et 
al., 2001), algae (e.g. oscillotoria  and chlorella  species, etc. (Dilek et al., 1999). Moreover, from a wide variety of habitat some 
bacteria, mixed microbial culture, white -rot fungus are found to degrade dye using enzymes such as lignin peroxidase (LiP), 
manganese dependent peroxidases (MnP), phenoloxidases , laccases, cellobiose dehydrogenase, and H₂O₂ producing enzymes like 
glucose -1-oxidase and glucose -2-oxidase(Buntic et al., 2017).  
Anaerobic biodegradation is primarily documented as a hydrogen oxidation -reduction reaction and the formation of hydrogen 
sulphide, methane, carbon dioxide, other gaseous compounds, and electrons are released, resulting in the decolorization of effl uent by 
reacting with the colorant. The best option is thermophilic anaerobic treatment, as textile effluents are usually released at high 
temperatures (40 -70 percent). The primary advantage of anaerobic biological treatment effluent decolorization is the production of 
biogas, which can be reused for power, and the generation of heat, thus reducing the cost of energy.  
The textile wast ewater is a major concern and is potentially carcinogenic and extremely toxic (Sharma, Dangi & Shukla 2018) 
such that it has become a significant danger to living organisms in an ecosystem as a result of different illnesses in human beings , 
animals and to environment deterioration (Khan & Malik 2018). Contaminants must also be broken down, degraded, or converted into 
non-toxic or less -toxic forms, thus eliminating, restoring, or removing contaminants from the atmosphere. In general, textile dyes 
cause disea ses from central nervous system disorders to dermatitis (Khan & Malik, 2018) or can result in enzymatic activities being 
inactivated by enzymatic cofactors being substituted (Copaciu et al., 2013).

IV. TOXICITIES  
With permanent damage to the cornea and conjunctiva, the CV dye is recorded to cause mild eye irritation and painful 
sensitization to light. It is highly toxic to mammalian cells and, if ingested via the skin in harmful amounts, can cause ski n irritation 
and irritation of the digestive tract. In extreme conditions, it may also lead t o respiratory and kidney failure (Mittalet al., 2010). The 
oncogenic and protection potential as it interacts with DNA cells is controversial (Maley and Arbiser, 2013). It functions as  a mitotic 
poison as well as a clastogen (Au et al., 1978).  
Increased hep atocellular carcinoma in mice is indicated by excess use of crystal violet (Culp et  al., 2006), while in FDA studies 
there has been an rise in the number of thyroid cancers in rats fed crystal violet (Littlefield et al. , 1989). It prevents the 
hypothyroidi sm thyroid peroxidase and induces thyroid -stimulating hormone to duplicate thyroid cells from the pituitary gland 
(Arbiser, 2009).  
The use of crystal violet without contraindication is extremely secure and reliable. No cases of crystal violet linked cancer  have 
been found for decades. The toxicity of gentian violet is restricted to humans, as found in studies and case reports concerni ng the use 
of gentian violet (Berrios & Arbiser, 2011), and the FDA approved the selling of gentian violet over the counter.  
It induces gastrointestinal discomfort if taken orally (John 1968), and causes depression of white blood cells throug h intravenous 
injection (Young and  Hill 1924).  
 
4.1. Antibacterial Response  
Triphenylmethane dye has anti -fungal, anti -angiogenic, anti -bacterial, anti -trypanosomal, anti -helminthic, and anti -tumor 
properties . It has been a long tradition of use as a cure and as monotherapy for a variety of diseases (Maley and Arbiser 2015).  
Gentian violet's antibacterial action is stronger at high pH (Adams 1967). Organisms (like anaerobic bacteria) have a strong 
reduction mechanism as Gentian violent tolerant, whether gramme -positive or gram -negative (Ingraham 1933). Although the exact 
mode of action is unclear, an anti -microbial effect has been suggested fo r Crystal violet: free radic al formation (Zhang et al., 2011 ), 
inhibition of glutamine synthesis and protein synthesis (Hoffmann et al., 1995), inhibition of decreased oxidases of nicotina mide 
adenine dinucleotides phosphate (NADPH) (Perry et al., 2006), i nhibition of bacterial cell wall  formation ( Wu and Wood, 2018 ) or 
disruption of oxidative phosphorylation (Moreno et a l., 1988). A photodynamic effect of crystal violet has been identified in bacteria 
and in T. cruzi  mediated by free - radical mechanism (Do campo & Moreno 1990).  
As an anti -microbial, Bakker et al in 1992 retraced the use of dye for dermatological diseases. In addition to Candida  albicans , the 
investigators applied triphenylmethane dye to bacterial species ( Pseudomonas  aeruginosa , Staphylococc us aureus , Streptococcus  A & 
B, Proteus ). The result showed Gentian violet to be very effective with low concentration against species Streptococcus, 
Staphylococcus, and Candida and forms adducts with it because of its ability to penetrate and bind to prot eins in the bacterial cell 
wall. Owing to its inability to penetrate the bacterial cell wall, Crystal violet is much less effective against Mycobacterium and gram -
negative bacteria. This has been in clinical use for more than a century, as this  is the basi s of Gram staining.  
It has been used for a long time to avoid bacterial umbilical stump infection following childbirth (Zupan et al., 2004) . 
Gentian violet also has low inhibitory MRSA efficacy in the setting of ulcers with no significant side effects (Oka no et al., 2000). 
It has emerged as a possible treatment for infectious MRSA, successfully used for graft infection with prosthetic vascular by pass 
(Igari et al., 2011), mediastinitis (Kato et al., 2006), MRSA nasal carriage (Okano et al., 2000) and notiti s media (Kayama et al., 
2006).  
In 2003, the FDA cleared the foam dressing of gentian violet polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA) as a bacteriostatic dressing (refers to  
capable of inhibiting the reproduction or growth of bacteria) for use on diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, 
superficial burns, arterial ulcers, donor sites, trauma wounds, post -operative incisions, lacerations, and abrasions (Edwards 2016).  
 
4.2. Genotoxic action  
Gentian violet has been used as a chromatin or nuclear stain for sever al years. It binds to DNA and interacts with two adjacent 
base pairs of A -T, causing extreme binding or/ and kinking, accompanied by DNA double helix coupled unwinding (Wu and Wood, 
2018). This causes damage to DNA and thereby contributes to the creation of  malignant tumors. Moreover, (Kim and Norden, 1993) 
evidence shows that gentian violet is linked to the major DNA groove. In addition, the vast majority of small molecules and n atural 
products that bind nucleic acid tend to inhabit the narrower minor groov e, where hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions with the 
groove's walls and floor are maximized (Nunez et al., 2019).  © 2020  JETIR November  2020 , Volume 7, Issue 11                                                        www.jetir.org (ISSN -2349 -5162)  
JETIR20111 58 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org  179 
 For any of the five strains of Salmonella  typhimurium , or Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  strain XV185 -14C (Shahin and  Von Borstel , 
1978), mu tagenicity analysis of various dyes interpreted that gentian violet was not mutagenic. With free radical formation, Gentian 
violet was shown to have oxidation -reduction ability. A thiazole antibiotic called thiostrepton (TS) further increased the cytotoxic  
activity of Gentian violet, which suppresses the expression of oncogenic transcriptional factor FOXM1, which is primarily nee ded for 
cell cycle progression and also shows resistivity to oncogenic oxidative stress (Garufi et al., 2014).  
 
4.3. Antimycotic A ction  
Gentian violet has an antifungal activity against many candida species. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness o f 
crystal violet against candida in catheter infection settings. Catheters coated with gentian violet were found to be superi or in reducing 
the burden of E.coli in many species of microorganisms in the urine, bladder and colony (Hachem et al., 2009). It is used for  treating 
parasitic nematodes of Enterbium (pinworm) (Bumbalo & Gustina, 1955) and Strongyloides  (Browne et al. , 1957).  
GV is also used as an oral thrush remedy; for 90 years, it has been an effective and safe remedy to treat oral candidiasis by  
painting an infant's mouth with oral thrush ( Maley and Arbiser 2013) . Oral candidiasis is the most common infection in H IV- infected 
patients (Blignaut , 2007). In addition, Candida's ability to form biofilms depends on both the host immune status and antibiotic 
resistance (Stewart and  Costerton 2001). The biofilms produced by candida isolated from HIV infected patients are inh ibited by 
Gentian violet (Mukherjee et al., 2017). For the treatment of Candida biofilms, antifungals are widely used (Kuhn et al., 200 2; 
Mukherjee et al., 2003). It is important to grow antibiofilm to treat oral candidiasis. In HIV infected patients, trip henylmethane dye is 
used as a fungicidal agent against planktonic candida cells to treat oral candidiasis at a concentration of 0.5 percent -1 percent 
(Traboulski et al., 2008).  
The toxicity of gentian violet has been reported in some of the studies for th e treatment of oral candidiasis including necrosis 
(John 1968) and oral  mucosal irritati on (Vucicevic  et al., 2005 ), obstructive laryngotracheitis (Baca, Drexler and Cullen 2001), and 
difficulty with breastfeeding (Utter 1990).  
 
4.4. Cytogenic toxicity  
In cell culture, the dye also induces cytogenic toxicity. In the culture of CHO cells, HeLa & L cells, human lymphocytes, and 
fibroblastic cell lines, it smashes chromosomes. Gentian violet in CHO cells also induces chromatid exchange. In vivo assay, since it  
failed to induce sister chromatid exchange, the dye was not clastogenic. In addition, it was shown to be highly toxic to the developing 
embryos of chicks at high dosages (Docampo and Moreno 1990).  
CV has also been found to cause a decrease in the synthesis of RNA and proteins and decreased consumption of oxygen in the 
tissue of rabbit granulation.  The deposition of crystal violet and malachite green in sediments and water was recorded  in the Buffalo 
River, New York , USA, (Nelson and Hites, 1980) . These chemicals have been suggested to be responsible for promoting tumour 
growth in several fish species that  feed on the bottom (Cho et al.,  2003). Therefore, both the aquatic environment and the human 
population pose a serious threat.  
 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUT URE PROSPECTUS  
Bioremediation has been established in recent years as a possible solution for a significant number of wastewater treatment 
processes. However, in practical applications, engineering scale degradation work is very minimal, generally concentr ated in the 
experimental procedure.  
In human and veterinary medicine, Gentian violet (GV) /Crystal Violet (CV), a triphenylmethane dye, has been commonly used as  
a biological stain, as a textile dye in the textile processing industry and also to provide paints and printing ink with a deep violet 
colour . Genetic violet has been used for nearly 100 years in medicine: for external use  as an antiseptic, oral administratio n as an anti -
Helminthic agent; and more recently as a blood additive, to prevent the tran smission of Chagas' disease.  To avoid fungal growth in 
poultry feed, GV is also used as a mutagenic and bacteriostatic agent in medical solutions and as an antimicrobial agent. FDA  proved 
gentian violet as a bacteriostatic dressing on ulcers. To date, ther e have been no recorded serious side effects when used externally . 
GV has been reported as a recalcitrant dye molecule, despite its many uses, that persists in the environment for a long time and poses 
toxic environmental effects. In some species of fish, it functions as a mitotic toxin, a potent carcinogen and a potent clastogen that 
promotes tumour development. GV is therefore recognised as a biohazard material. It is still considered a challenging task to 
effectively eliminate dye micro -pollutants from i ndustrial waste water supplies. While several physico -chemical methods are recorded 
for the r emoval of GV, such as coagulation, adsorption  and ion -pair extraction, these methods are inadequate for the complete 
removal of GV from industrial waste water and also generate large quantities of secondary pollutant -containing sludge. However, for 
industrial wastewater treatment, biological methods are considered to be cost -effective and eco -friendly, but these methods also have 
some limitations. There is an urgent  need, to establish certain eco -friendly and cost -effective biological treatment methods for the 
protection of the environment, as well as for human and animal welfare, it may effectively extract dye from industrial waste water.  
It is important for the rec ycling and reuse of their wastewater in industries that use large water volumes such as textiles, leather, 
paints, acrylic, cosmetics, plastics and pharmaceutical, etc. The previous GV account shows that because of its adverse effec ts on the 
environment an d extreme health threats posed to living organisms, this dye has now become one of the most discussed and 
controversial compounds. It is therefore concluded that GV is a pollutant that is recalcitrant and has harmful effects on bot h marine 
and terrestrial habitats. It also serves as a mitotic poisoning agent, a carcinogen and a potent clastogen that promotes tumour growth in 
some fish species. Therefore, for the degradation and detoxification of waste water containing GV, a regular and efficient tr eatment 
system should be employed. In this respect, methods of physical and chemical treatment are very expensive and contain a large 
number of different forms of secondary contaminants as well. Therefore, an environmentally sustainable and cost -effective biologica l 
method for the effective degradation and detoxification of GVs for environmental protection needs to be developed urgently.
