1. Abstract  
 
Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a method which produces biogas through the treatment of bio -
waste. However, there are limitations in the process such as low conversion to biogas and poor 
quality of biogas (high CO 2 content ) which  limits the application of biogas. Multiple factors 
play a role in  the operation of the AD process. Ammonia is necessary for microorganism 
growth, but can inhibit methanogenesis in high quantities.  The first part o f this paper 
investigates the effect of NH 4Cl concentration on the methanogenic activity.  Reactors with 10 
g/L NH 4Cl performed the best for biogas production  at 59 ml/day, while reactors with 4 g/L 
NH4Cl resulted in the best biogas quality, with 56.7 mol% CH 4, and 43.7 mol% CO 2. 
 
Secondly, there have been recent studies which demonstrated the improvement of 
methanogenic activity in AD systems through application of a milli -voltage, through a  
microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) reactor set up. Two-chambered MECs reactors are difficult 
and expensive to upscale. Thus, the second part of this paper investigates the effects of a single 
chamber MECs on the performance and biogas production of anaerob ic bacteria . The data 
suggests that the addition of a milli -voltage is advantageous in terms of the volume of biogas 
production. Batch MEC experiments with 1.34 V / 0.006 A performs the best both in terms of 
production rate and total gas production.  The ba tch MECs reactor is then set up as a continuous 
system for further application.  
 
2. Introduction  
 
In the present, a rapid increase in the energy demand has exhausted fossil fuel reserves and 
increased worries concerning climate change. As a result, there ha s been a shift in the focus 
from a fossil fuel -based energy model, increasingly towards renewables. One of the main 
sources of energy is natural gas, which is a hydrocarbon gas mixture mainly made up of 
methane. Biogas is a promising green alternative to n atural gas, mainly composed of CH 4 (50-
80 mol%) and CO 2 (20-50 mol%)  , and is made through a process called anaerobic digestion 
(AD) [1][2]. The process involves many different groups of bacteria which carry out the 
process in consecutive steps, namely hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and 
methanogenesis  (Figure 1.)  [3], [4] . Firstly, c omplex organic matter such as protein o r 
polysaccharides are broken down by microorganisms in an oxygen -free environment into 
smaller chemical components  through hydrolysis and acidogenesis . Methanogenesis, the last 
step, is carried out by anaerobic methanogenic Archa ea which convert acetate, H 2, and CO 2 
into methane. This happens through three different pathways: Reaction 1 ) acetotrophic 
pathway, Reaction 2 ) hydrogenotrophic pathway, and Reaction 3 ) methylotrophic pathway [4], 
[5] . Multiple factors play a role in determining the composition of biogas including the carbon 
oxidation -reduction state of the organic material , operation conditions , and the type of AD 
process [1]. 4

 Overview of the  different methanogenic pathways. Reaction 1)  Acetotrophic pathway, 2) Hydrogenotrophic 
pathway, and 3) Methylotrophic pathway .  
AD can be used as a novel method for resource recovery through the combination of waste 
treatment with the production of a high value product  [7]. Other than energy production, the 
process also h as a wide range of environmental benefits as the process allows for odor reduction 
of waste, conservation of nutrients, and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions [8]. There are 
many possibilities for differ ent wastes to be used  as the starting material,  such as municipal 
sludge/wastewaters, animal manure, and industrial sludge, which allows for flexibility in the 
application of the method . However, a problem found when using complex substrates such as 
those in manure or municipal waste is that it contains traces of ammonia , produced through the 
degradation of nitrogenous matter  [9]. Small amounts of ammonia are essential for the growth 
of m icroorganisms, but can cause inhibition at larger concentrations.  The total ammonia 
nitrogen (TAN) is the value which depicts the total amount of nitrogen in the forms of NH 3 
and NH 4+ in water.  Ammonium chloride is added as the TAN source, of which corresp onds to 
1/3 of the mass of NH 4Cl (NH 4+: 18.039 u, Cl-: 35.45 u) [10], [11] . A previous study showed 
that initial inhibition of AD reactors occurred at 30 g/L of NH 4Cl, and 50% inhibition was 
observed at 35 g/L of NH 4Cl [12]. The first part of this research paper is to investigate the 
effect of NH 4Cl concentrations lower th an 30 g/L on the methanogenic activity of AD reactors.  
There  are still many other problems surrounding th e replacement  of natural gas with biogas  as 
conventional AD processes have low efficiency, with only 50 -60% of the starting material 
5 
 converted  into CH 4 [13].Furthermore, the produced biogas  typically contains a high fraction  of 
CO 2 (20-50 mol%) , resulting in a low calorific value [13], [2]. Other contaminants such as H 2S 
(0.01 -0.4 mol%)  and condensates of H 2O (0-12 mol%) causes corrosions of equipment within 
the gas grid, while high concentrations of O 2  (~2%) is an explosion hazard  [14], [2]. Thus, the 
use of biogas is currently limited to on -site heat, steam, and electricity generation. For a larger 
application such as that of natural gas, biogas must reach high standards through cleaning and 
upgrading , in order to reach  compositions of CH4 (95 -99 mol%),  CO 2 (1-5%), and no H2S  [1], 
[15],[16]. There is a plethora of different upgrading methods of biogas of which may involve 
water/organic solvent/amine scrubbing, membrane technology, etc. [5]. However, these tends 
to be energy an d resource intensive, and further produces waste which limits their use [17]. 
The ideal situation would be for the production process to be economically and 
environmentally viable, without comprom ising the quality of biogas. This would mean that the 
calorific value should be suitable for injection into the main gas grid with little to no energy 
requirement. However, methane production in traditional AD processes is limited by energy 
barriers, causi ng low electron transfer efficiency . A method to surpass these barriers could be 
through the use of bio -electrochemical systems (BES) [18].    
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. (a) Schematic diagram of the operating principles of a two-chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC). 
The Anodic chamber is under anaerobic conditions while the Cathodic chamber is under aerobic conditions. 
The bacterium in the anode compartment transfers electrons from an electron donor such as glucose to the 
cathode, while the protons travel through the proton exch ange membrane  (PEM)1 . They then recombine 
with oxygen, forming water [18], [19] . Picture sourced from: [19]. (b) Schematic diagram of the operating 
principles of a two -chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). Both chambers operate under anaerobic 
conditions.  
 
Bio-electrochemical  systems (BES) are emerging  novel configurations , utilizing bacteria as a 
catalyst  for organic waste treatment and subsequent recovery of resources such as 
bioelectricity, hydrogen, or biogas . This  consists mainly of two different categories [20]. 
Firstly, microbial fuel cells (MFC)  utilizes electro chemically active  bacteria  called exo -
electrogens  in order to  oxidize  organic waste within the anodic chamber , subsequently 
releas ing electrons and protons  (see Figure 2. (a)) [21]. The protons flow through the proton 
exchange membra ne to the cathodic chamber, while t he electr ons flow via an external  circuit  
from anode to cathode , creating an electrical current which can then be utilized  [22]. The proton 
exchange membrane ( PEM ) regulates ionic flux between both chambers, which could 
otherwise affect the pH balance of the system, in turn affecting the performance of the 
a) b) 6 
 methanogens [23].  Finally, electrons in the cathodic chamber, which is kept under aerobic 
conditions, combines with oxygen and protons to form water , although man y other electron 
acceptors can be used  [19], [20], [22] . The achieve d working cell potential of this system has 
been shown to be approximately 0.4V, but theoretically has a potential of up to 1.1 V under 
neutral pH conditions [19], [21] . 
 
A modified version of this, and the focus of this paper, is called a Microbial electrolysis cells 
(MEC)  (see Figure 2. (b)) . It operates fully under anaerobic conditions, and requires an applied 
voltage in order to  produce  biofuel s such as H 2 gas or further synthesize more complex, high 
grade chemicals such as CH 4 from waste such as CO 2 [18], [20] . As a fuel, methane has an 
advantage over H 2 as it can be easily stored or transported as opposed to H 2, so biogas is 
prioritized as the desired product in this paper [21]. Similar  to MFCs, MECs operate using  
electrochemically active microorganisms  attached to the electrodes as biofilms  in order to 
anaerobically digest the substrate in  the anodic compartm ent. However, the voltage produced 
at the anode is insufficient to drive the formation of H 2 (Ecell≅ -0.414 V, pH=7), or the 
production of biomethane through the reduction of carbon dioxide  (theoretical Ecell≅ 0.244 V, 
pH=7) [21], [24] . Applying a small voltage  of around 0.2 -0.8V, substantially lower than that 
of conventional water electrolysis (1.23 V) , allows for a reduction in the thermodynamic 
barrier , and  the process can be fine -tuned  depending on the applied voltage  [18].

Overview of the half reactions occurring at the anode and cathode. Reaction 4)  Oxidation of acetate at 
the anode, and the formation of H 2 or CH 4 at the cathode. [21][25] 
 
 
Recent studies have shown that a significant amount of methane can be produced through 
MECs (see table 1 ). This is achieved through different pathways, mainly from acetate via 
acetoclastic methanogenesis , followed by H 2 and CO 2 via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis  
(see figure 1.). Furthermore, there is evidence in literature that suggests the possibility that 
methanogens are able to receive direct electron transfer from the cathode for methanogenesis, 
without the need for hydrogen evolution [26][27]. This could potentially make the process 
more tolerant to t oxic compounds such as ammonia , which could otherwise limit the activity 
of methanogens  [28].Furthermore, there is literature that suggests the possibility of reduced 
nitrogen compounds such as ammonium as a source of electrons  [29]. It was shown that 
ammonium oxidation can be coupled to H 2 production in MECs  at potentials between +550 to 
+150 mV (vs. standard hydrogen electrode), and further used to produce methane.  7 
 The production of methane in MECs possesses multiple advantages over conventional AD 
reactions, firstly being that it produces biogas with higher methane concentrations. 
Furthermore, the process occurs at ambient temperatures and only requires mi lli-voltages in 
order to drive the process.  However, there are still many difficulties with two-chambered MEC 
systems, specifically with upgrading to large scale applications. Furthermore, membranes such 
as PEM s can be  expensive and adds difficulty to the operation of the system.  It also affects the 
rate of diffusion, causing accumulation of protons at the anode , affecting the microbial activity, 
and increases internal resistance of the system [30]. As a result, single chambered MECs will 
be explored in this paper  (see figure 3. ).

depicted.  [31] 
 
The aim of this research paper is to investigat e the effects of a microbial electrolysis  system 
and ammonia concentration on the performance and biogas production of anaerobic bacteria. 
The research was split into 2 main experiments : 1) investigate the sensitivity of methanogens 
to different concentrations of ammonia  in an AD set up  in order to establish a baseline for 
future experiments with MECs; 2) investigate the feasibility of producing biogas using single 
chambered MECs in a continuous set up in order to increase the biogas production, quality, 
and improve the application prospects of th is method. The second experiment was further 
divided into three main stages: A) set up batch reactors until the activity of the methanogens 
are stabilized  and find a baseline for future reactions ; B) apply electricity to the batch reactor 
in order to see t he effect of a mi lli-voltage on the methanogenic activity ; and C) set up a 
continuous microbial fuel cell  system .

      A. Normal pressure a naerobic digestion  (NPAD) reactors  
 
3.A.1.  NPAD reactors : reactor set up  
 
The NPAD reactors were set up in glass bottles with a volume of 500 ml, and the liquid phase 
was controlled to approximately 2 50.0 ml (see figure 6 .). The bottle is securely sealed with a 
rubber stopper. The stopper is equipped with a gas valve connected to a needle positioned at 
the gas phase, and a valve for feeding and sampling, connected to a metal tube positioned to 
the top part of the liquid phase. The  gas production was monitored with a water displacement 
bottle connected to the gas valve . The reactors were incubated  in an incubator shaker  (New 
Brunswick Scientific Co. inc. Incubator Shaker)  at 36.5oC, and a shaking speed of 150 rpm.

3.A.2. NPAD:  Experimental set up  
 
Reactors were inoculated with anaerobic sludge collected from a n anaerobic digester treating 
aerobic sludge from Garmerwolde  wastewater treatment facility located in the  Netherlands.  
Synthetic wastewater  was prepared according to [35] as follows: K2HPO 4.3H 20 3.6 g/L, 
KH 2PO4 2.8 g/L, NaHCO 3 5 g/L, glucose 6.8 g/L, trace element solution  1.0 ml/L , 1.0 ml/L 
Wolfe’s vitamin solution, and 1.0 ml/L of a pre -prepared Cysteine sulfid e reducing agent  (L-
Cysteine·HCl·H 2O and Na 2S·9H 2O) dissolved in deionized water. Different  concentrations of 
NH 4Cl were added  in order to make  synthetic wastewater with  the following  concentrations : 
2 g/L, 4 g/L, 6 g/L, 8 g/L, 10 g/L, 12 g/L.  Equal amounts (100  ml) of Synthetic wastewater 
and anaerobic sludge were added into each reactor. The experiment was duplicated for each 
variable  (see table 2 .). The NH 4Cl concentrations of the control reactors 1 & 2 were changed 
from 2 g/L to 24 g/L starting from day  26 by changing the feed buffer  in order to investigate 
the effect of higher NH 4Cl concentrations .

Gas samples of 10.0 ml were taken every other day  through the gas valve  for analysis  using 
GC. Using a syringe, 15.0 ml liquid samples were taken daily from the reactors and the volume 
was replaced with a fresh feed of synthetic wastewater with their respective NH 4Cl 
concentrations. The hydraulic retention time ( HRT) of the reactors are 13.33 days. The water 
displacement bottles were weighed daily in order to calculate the daily gas production .

3.A.4.  Physical and chemical analysis  
 
The pH of the samples was analyzed using a digital pH meter (H160, Hach, Germany). The 
samples were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was then analyzed 
by titration using an auto -titrator (AT1000, Hach, Germany) with 0.1 M H 2SO 4 to the end 
points of pH 5.0 and 4.4. This gave the results for the volatile fatty acids content (VFAs) and 
total alkalinity (TA). The biogas compositions of the gas samples were analyzed using gas 
chromatography (C2V -200 Micro GC,  Thermo Scientific). The machine was equipped with a 
thermal conductivity detector and a GCC200 -U-BND cartridge. The injector and detector had 
a temperature of 120oC, while the column was at 60oC. The carrier gas used was helium.

3.B.1 MEC: Reactor  set up  and analysis    
 
A potentiostat was aimed to be used to control the applied voltage in the electrical system. This 
was set -up according to instructions mentioned in 
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201353#sec002 , and 
consists of a PSoC 5LP (part number CY8CKIT -059)  Cypress Semiconductor. The PSoC was 
inserted into the computer through the USB programmer end (male end), and using the free 
PSoC Programmer from Cypress Semiconductor (found at 
:https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc -programming -solutions  ), the internal firmware was 
firstly upgraded. Then the necessary file for the potentiostat was uploaded into the device 
(found at: https://github.com/KyleLopin/PSoC -Potentiostat  ). Wi th the device removed, wires 
for the working electrode and counter electrode were connected in the pins of their respective 
places. The female end of the device was then connected through a USB cable into the 
computer. The free program called Zadig (found at: https://zadig.akeo.ie  ) was used to install 
a generic USB driver which allows communication with the device. The graphical user 
interface for the potentiostat from Github (found at: 
https://github.com/KyleLopin/Potentiostat_GUI/releases ) could then interact with the device. 
In practice, this did not work, thus, a power supply with a constant voltage mode was used as 
an alternative (Velleman PS300 5D).  
 
 
Phase 1: Establish base line through batch experiments  
 
A baseline for the reactors were first established by setting up the batch reactors without 
electricity  (see figure 4 .). Two reactors were set up using the Eppendorf single use bioreactor 
BioBlu®. Metal needle s were used to hold the carbon felt electrodes (~6.0 cm x 1.0 cm) within 
the reactors, and the open -ended  hub was tightly sealed using a plastic cap in order to stop air 
flow into the reactor. The metal needles were connected using wires to the power source. 
However, during this phase no electricity was applied to the system. A sampl ing/feeding  tube 
was connected to the outlet port, which is connected to a plastic tube  positioned within the 
reactor at the top part of the liquid phase. A gas valve was used to connect Gas counters ( Ritter 
MGC -1 V3.4 PMMA ) to the gas port, which is positioned to take samples from the gas phase. 
The gas counters are connected to a raspberry  pi programmed to measure and log the results  in 
order to constantly monitor the gas production. The reactors were inoculated with 
approximately 1 15 ml of anaerobic sludge and 1 15 ml of synthetic wastewater as previously 
mentioned in section 3.A.2 , making up a total volume of approximately 2 30 ml. No NH 4Cl was 
added to the synthetic wastewater. The reactors were kept in a water bath at 39oC (Julabo D 
7633, Germany), and stirred usi ng an electric motor (XINDA motor Co., LTD DX -3420) set 
on low . Using a syringe, 10 ml of 30 g/L glucose solution was fed daily through the 
feeding/sampling valve. The gas counters were disconnected during feeding as to not count the 
gas flow due to the ad dition of the liquid to the system . No volume was removed until the gas 
production reached a stable rate.  During th e operation of phase 1 , the reactor set ups were made 
sure to be entirely air tight, and the gas counters were calibrated in order to show the correct 
amount of gas production.  12 
  
 Figure 4. A schematic diagram of the set -up of batch MECs reactors . Electricity was not applied during 
phase 1 . Electricity was supplied in later phases using an energy source (Velleman PS3005D).   
 
Phase 2: Ap plication of electricity to operate MEC reactors  
 
The batch experiments were operated for a total of 45 days. Initially, t he batch reactors  were 
run for 24 days without applied electricity until it reached stable gas production. On day 24,  a 
total of 100 ml of liquid was removed from the reactors, equivalent to the total amount of feed 
fed since the beginning of the experiment.  A sample of 15 ml was kept for later analysis in -
20oC. The gas counters were disconnected from the gas outlet and replaced with a syringe filled 
with N 2 gas. This ensured anaerobic conditions. When liquid was withdrawn from the reactors, 
N2 gas is drawn into the headspace instead. After the liquid was removed, the gas  counters 
were re installed.  The reactors were left to run over night for one more day in order to remove 
the N 2 gas in the headspace. The next day (day 25) gas bags were connected to the gas counters 
in order to collect the gas produced from the reactors. Wires were used to connect the electrodes 
of reactor 1 to the power supply (Velleman PS3005D).  The voltage was set to 10  V and the 
maximum current to 0.01  A. The voltage is set higher than needed as to by -pass the limitations 
of the power supply and operat e the machine in constant current mode. Once turned on, the 
voltage is able to increase until it reaches the set value for the cur rent. The power supply records 
a voltage of 1.34 V and a current at 0.006 A.  These conditions were operated for 4 days.  Reacto r 
2 is the control. It contains electrodes but does not have a power supply . The reactors were 
stirred using an electric motor as mentioned previously. Using a syringe, 10.0 ml samples were 
taken daily ( aside  from weekends) through the sampling valve from each reactor, and kept in -
20oC conditions for later analysis. The volume was then replaced with 10.0 ml of 30 g/L 
glucose solution.  The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the reactors is 23 days, and an organ ic 
loading rate (OLR) of 1.3 g/L day. Gas samples of 10.0 ml were taken daily from the gas bag 
using a syringe and analyzed using GC  as previously mentioned in 3.A.4.  The gas bag was 
then emptied in order to collect new gas samples for the following day.  
 
 
 
 
13 
 On day 28,  the current on the power supply was shown as 0 A due to corrosion of the cathode , 
which interrupted the circuit . As a result, the needle was replaced with a metal tube. The 
opening was sealed with a rubber tube , tied at the end  so as not to allow air into the reactor. 
The electrode material used was the same as previously mentioned. The voltage was set to 5 V 
and the current at 0.05 A. Once turned on, the power supply records a voltage of 2.21 V  and 
0.003 A. These conditions wer e operated for 3 days. On day 31 , the power supply was set to a 
voltage of 0.6 V and a current at 0.05A. Once turned on, the power supply records a voltage of 
0.6 V and a current at 0 A. The power supply does not seem to be sensitive enough to record 
micro currents.  These conditions were operated for  14 days.  The GC  results signified that the 
gas samples taken via the gas bags were being diluted. Thus, the gas bags were removed on 
day 38 and samples were taken from the overhead chamber instead. During this p rocess, all 
ports were closed with clamps, and the volume was replaced with N 2 gas via the gas port.  
 
Phase 3: Making a continuous MEC  reactor  
 
On day 45 , the batch experiments were stopped. Due to acidification of reactor 1, the contents 
of the reactor were discarded. Reactor 2 was set up as a continuous BES reactor  (see figure 5 .). 
The cathode  was replaced with a metal tube , following the same procedure as previously 
mentioned in Phase 2  to avoid rapid corrosion. Wires were used to connect the electrodes of 
reactor 2 to the power supply (Velleman PS3005D). The power supply was set to a voltage of 
0.6 V and a current at 0.05  A. Once turned on, the power su pply records a voltage of 0.6 V and 
a current at 0 A.  A syringe filled with 120.0 ml of 13 g/L glucose solution was connected via 
a tube to the LA(O) port  for feeding , while an empty syringe was connected via a  tube to the 
sampling valve  for sampling . Both syringes were placed within a syringe pump (INACCOM 
instruments, NE -1000X) set at 0.96 ml/hour  in opposite directions .  The HRT of the reactors 
is equal to that of the batch MEC reactors, at 20 days.  The contents of the sampling syring e 
were emptied daily , of which 10.0 ml was taken for further analysis and kept under -20oC 
conditions. T he syringe for feeding was re -filled every 5 days. The reactor was stirred using an 
electric motor to ensure the reactor contents are homogenous ly mixed . Gas samples were taken 
from the headspace following the procedure as mentioned in Phase 2 .  For analysis, the samples 
kept under -20oC were thawed and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 minutes. The pH of 
supernatant was determined using  a digital pH meter (H160, Hach, Germany).  The VFAs in 
the supernatant of the samples were determined using high -performance liquid 
chromatography (Agilent Technologies 1200 series) which was equipped with a Bio -Rad 
Aminex HPX -87H 300 x 7.8 mm column at 60oC and UV -detector at 210 nm. The eluent used 
was 5 mM H 2SO 4 at a rate of 0.5 mL/min.

Looking at figure 6. (A), it can be seen that the gas production of all reactors follows a general 
trend and fluctuates  around approximately 50 ml/day.  The oscillation is largely due to absence 
during the weekends, where no feeding, sampling, or measurements were done.  The increas e 
in the biogas production is due to the continued conversion of organic carbon within the 
reactors to biogas during the weekend. This indicates that organic acid residues are present in 
the liquid phase. The largest fluctuations in gas production can be s een in the first 30 days, 
which is needed for stabilization of the reactors.  This is signified by the vertical black dashed 
line.  In the second half of the experiments after this line, it can be seen that the gas production 
is more stabilized.  
 
The expec ted trend is that with an increase in NH 4Cl concentration, the performance of the 
reactors will decrease. However, no significant trend could be observed in the first 30 days 
during the stabilization period , and often reactors with higher NH 4Cl concentrations were 
performing better . As a result, the concentration of NH 4Cl of the feed for the control reactor 
was significantly increased from 2 g/L to 24 g/L in order to observe a larger change. Looking 
at reactors 1 & 2 in figure 1 ( B) after the con centration of the feed was changed to 24 g/L, it 
can be seen that the trend in the gas production does not significantly vary from previously and 
performs similarly as reactors with NH 4Cl concentrations between 6 -10 g/L. The total average 
gas production do es decrease slightly (See table 4). However, due to the stabilization period it 
is hard to determine an accurate trend for the activity with 2 g/L, so an accurate comparison 
cannot be made. Furthermore, the reactors have a retention time of 20 days so it w as not enough 
time to see the full effect of the large increase in NH 4Cl concentration.  
 
Overall, reactors with 4 g/L of NH 4Cl can be seen to reach the highest amounts  of gas 
production , but overall reactors with 10 g/L had the highest total average gas production  (table 
3.) at 59 ml/day, corresponding to 72%  efficiency . Reactors  with 12 g/L can be seen to perform 
the worst , and also has the lowest total average gas production at 4 3 ml/da y, corresponding to 
52% yield.  However, reactors with 4 g/L and 12 g/L had the highest  fluctuations , suggesting 
that they are the least stable. Reactors with concentrations in between these values do not 
follow a specific trend  in the gas production , but their activity is  more stable . Nitrogen is an 
important nutrient for microorganism’s growth . The results  suggest  that AD systems can 
tolerate small concentrations of NH 4Cl and may even aid in the stability of the reactors . 
Concentrations of 2 g/L may not be  sufficient for microorganism growth while 24 g/L may be 
too high, resulting in inhibition. Thus, the highest gas production was within this range, with NH 4Cl

 results showing that 10 g/L of NH 4Cl being the best for gas production. However, a small 
increase to 12 g/L of NH 4Cl can significantly affect the stability of the reactors and cause a 
~20% decrease in the yield. More research is needed to see the full effects for larger 
concentrations such as 24 g/L.

Looking at Figure 7. , it can be seen that the largest fluctuations in biogas quality for both the 
CH 4 and CO 2 fractions can be seen in the first 30 days, which coincides with the stabilization 
period seen in the biogas production  (Figure 6. ). Looking at Figure. 7 (a), it can be seen that 
reactors with 4 g/L NH 4Cl has the largest CH 4 fraction, with an average of 56. 6 mol %, while 
the reactors with 24 g/L NH 4Cl has the lowest average, at 51.8 mol % ( Table 5). Reactors with 
10 & 12 g/L NH 4Cl have the highest CO 2 fraction at 46.2 and 46. 9 mol %. The results confirm 
that with less NH 4Cl, there is an improvement in biogas quality, with an increase in CH 4 and a 
decrease in C O2. However, there seems to be no obvious  trend with NH 4Cl concentrations 
between 6 -10 g/L.  Reactors with 10 g/L NH 4Cl performs the best for biogas production, but is 
less advantageous in biogas quality as it has the second highest mol% of CO 2 following reactors 
with 12 g/L NH 4Cl.

C: The average TAC of reactors with different concentrations between 2 -24 g/L .  
D: The ratio VFA/TA of reactors with different concentrations between 2 -24 g/L  
 
The optimal pH range for the activity of methanogens is between  6.8-7.8 [36][37]. The pH of 
the reactors under the given conditions are within this range  (see f igure 8.A ). However, the 
general trend shows that the reactor contents are acidified over time.  This is trend is also seen 
in the behavior of the buffering capacity  (TAC)  (see figure 8.C ). The TAC value corresponds 
to the buffer capacity of the s ystem  and is measured with respect to mg CaCO 3/L [38]. Once 
the buffering capacity decreases, the acidity of the VFAs cannot be as efficiently neutralized, 
resulting a continuous drop in the pH. As the TAC value continues to decrease , the pH is also 
expected to  continue to decrease which is disadvantageous to the methanogenic activity for 
longer reactor operations. Comparing the pH of different reactors following the initial 
stabilization phase, it can be seen that with an increase in  NH 4Cl concentration, the reactors 
become more acidic.  However, the pH of the reactors is still above the lower limit of the 
optimal pH range (6.8), and thus in the range of optimal activity for methanogens.  
 
Initially, the volatile fatty acids ( VFAs ) concentration of the reactors is high as a large amount 
of VFAs are present in the sludge , which limits the biogas production  and coincides with the 
initial 30 -day stabilization phase . This initial peak decreases as the methanogens metabolize 
VFAs into methan e. There is no distinct trend between reactors with di fferent NH 4Cl 
concentrations and VFAs concentration. The VFA/TAC ratio is an indicator for assessing the 
fermentation process. The values for a well operated digester range  between 0.1 -0.35. The 
VFA/TAC ratio of the different reactors throughout the experi ment is within this range, 
indicating good fermentation activity and no significant  problems .

22 
 Looking at the average cumulative gas production in figure 9, it can be seen that there is a 
general trend where the biggest increase in the gas production occurs within the first 10 hours 
after feeding, and then level ing off.  The average gas production of the control group, can be 
seen in  figure 9.A . Overall, the rate and total gas production increase s from days 9 -22 to days 
37-44. However, the graph for days 24 -35 does not follow this trend, performing the most 
poorly. The graph for this period is also the least uniform, indicating that the results may not 
be reliable. This may be due to interruption in the stirring of the reactor , which effects the 
digestion and activity of the methanogens, or problems with  the gas counter.  
 
 
Figure 5. The biogas quality analysis results following GC technique of A: the control reactor  B: the 
experimental reactor .  
 
 
The average gas production of the experimental group, can be seen in figure 9.B . The addition 
of electricity increases the rate of gas production compared to the initial runs without 
electricity.  However, as it was shown in the control group , the rate of g as production should 
increase with time, so this cannot  be entirely attributed to the addition of electricity. Comparing 
the experimental runs with electricity, it can be seen that that with 1.34 V / 0.006 A performs 
the best both in terms of production rate and total gas production. However, the voltage exceeds 
the theoretical value at  which  water electrolysi s takes place ( 1.23 V). In practice, higher 
voltages (1.8 V) are needed but some of  the increase in gas production may be due to the 
production of oxygen and hydrogen  [39]. No reference electrode was used in the set up so it is 
difficult to determine the real voltage of the system compared to the reference voltage.  
Furthermore , due to problems with the gas bags, the gas samples during  this time were not 
reliable so information on the gas composition is not possible. Hydrogen can be used in the 
hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic pathway, as a result, further gas production may have 
been encouraged due to the increase in hydrogen. Howev er, oxygen limits the methanogenic 
activity. The following experimental run was with 2.21 V / 0.003 A, which initially performed 
at a rate similar to that of runs with conditions of 0.052 V / 0 A and 0.6V / 0 A, but the 
production rate slowed after approxi mately 5 hours, resulting in the lowest gas production. The 
voltage in this experiment was highest, which may disrupt the activity of the methanogens. 
Furthermore, if oxygen was produced in the previous experiment, this may further limit 
methanogenic activity. The experimental runs with 0.6 V / 0  A and 0.052  V/ 0 A behaved 
similarly due to the similarity in the conditions. The total gas production for 0.052 V/ 0  A was 
23 
 slightly higher, which may indicate that smaller milli -voltages may be m ore advantageous to 
methanogenic activity, although more research must be done in  order to confirm this. 
Compared to the average gas production of reactor 2 with no electricity, it can be seen that 
MECs with 1.34 V / 0.006 A overall performed the best both  in terms of production rate and 
total gas production, while the remaining MECs have a slower production rate compared to 
that of reactor 2. However, the total gas production of 0.6 V / 0 A and 0.052V/ 0 A was higher 
than that of reactor 2, so the addition  of a milli-voltage may be advantageous in terms of the 
volume of biogas production.

HPr: propionic acid, HAc: Acetic acid  
 
Looking at the VFA s analysis of the control group ( figure 10.A) it can be seen that there are 
higher amounts of VFAs up until 28 days, which may coincide with the initial 30 -day 
stabilization phase. After that, the amount of VFAs is low until it starts to increase once again 
after day 35. However, the concentration of VFAs is in the typical range for a digester between 
50 and 300 mg/L , which signifies that the digester is operating well. However, looking at the 
experimental group, it can be seen that there is an increase in the accumulation of VFAs above 
the optimal range which signifies that the r eactor is not well balanced. Firstly,  there is an 
accumulation of acetic acid above the range from day 28, meaning that methanogenesis does 
not optimally occur. The accumulation of acetic acid inhibits methanogenesis, which then also 
inhibits fatty acid ox idation, resulting in  the further accumulation of propionic acid  [40]. This 
can also be seen in the  acidification of the reactor. The results suggest that the addition of 
electricity increases the conversion of glucose to acetic acid resulting in a high VFAs 
concentration in the experimental group. However, the accumulation in acetic acid and low 
methan e content in the biogas analysis suggests that the conversion of acetic acid to biogas is 
not efficient.  During the reaction of the MECs reactor, the needle holding the electrode 
degraded and remained in the reactor for the remainder of the experiment. It has been shown 
in recent studies that heavy metals inhibit digestion at a soluble concentration of greater than 
0.5 mg/L [41]. However, the needle is too small to have had a significant e ffect on the

 4.B.2 MEC: continuous reactor   
 
Figure 11. The cumulative biogas production  (A)  and quality (B) of the  continuous MEC reactor  
 
The daily gas production of the contin uous MEC reactor is approximately 170 ml/day, which 
corresponds to 7 1% yield . The activity is comparable to that of the batch MECs with the 
condition of 1.34 V / 0.006 A , which is highest out of all MEC batch conditions . The average 
fraction of methane in the biogas samples i s ~52 %, while that of CO 2 is at ~46 %. This is 
comparable to that of the batch reactors, although slightly lower than that of the one without 
electricity.

Acetic acid  
 
The VFAs results of the continuous MEC reactor is much lower than that of the batch MEC 
reactor , with most of the acetic and all of the propionic acid rem oved which indicates that the 
activity is sufficiently high to consume all the substrates. However, the reactor also has some 
accumulation of isobutyric acid, indicating that the performance is not optimal.

 5. Improvement  and future prospects  
 
A. Normal pressure adiabatic (NPAD) reactors  
 
A large factor in the fluctuation  of the NPAD results was due to absence during the weekend 
where no feeding/sampling and analysis was done. Future improvements could be done by 
setting up the NPAD reactors as co ntinuous systems so that feeding and sampling are taken 
automatically.  This also eliminates a large fraction of human error, making the results more 
reliable. Furthermore, the results indicate  that the reactors have a stabilization period of 
approximately 30 days. As a result, reactors should be run for longer in order  to first stabilize 
the reactors, then  collect a significant amount of  data in order to observe a reliable trend. This 
experiment can then be combined with MEC reactors, as literature suggests  that the application 
of a milli -voltage can aid in increasing the tolerance of the system to toxic compounds such as 
ammonia.  
 
B. Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) reactors  
 
Throughout the operation of the experiment, there were multiple problems with the  set up and 
equipment which ha ve an effect on the operation of the reaction, and accuracy of the results.  
Firstly, there are a limited number of accurate GC  results due to a fault in the gas bags used for 
collecting the gas samples. Gas samples ta ken from the overhead compartment of the reactors 
gave more accurate results, so this technique should be used in future experiments. Secondly, 
the motor  system  for stirring  was unreliable , causing  interruptions in the mixing of reactor 
contents. Mixing is  crucial as it ensures even distribution of the substrate throughout the 
reactor, which enables microorganisms to have good nutrient supply. As a result, the 
interruptions in mixing may have caused microorganisms to not be sufficiently in contact with 
microorganisms,  having an  effect on the ir activity . Furthermore, the motor system was 
interchanged with a new system later on into the experiment which does not allow for accurate 
set up of the mixing rate at low rpms. As a result, the stirring rate could be t oo high, disrupting  
microbial aggregates  especially important on the carbon felt electrodes, resulting in less 
efficient degradation of the substrate. As a result, future experiments should ensure a fully 
functional stirring system, with an accurate stirri ng set up in order to ensure stirring at optimum 
speeds.  
 
The energy source for the MEC reactors used was the Velleman PS3005D  
power supply. However, in practice this device did not allow for precise set up and monitoring 
of microcurrents. For future expe riments, a potentiostat should be used which would allow for 
more accuracy and control, especially at such microcurrents, which has been shown in previous 
papers to be more beneficial to the growth and activity of the bacteria. The voltage should be 
kept t o below 1V in order to avoid water hydrolysis which produces oxygen. This interrupts 
the anaerobic environment and limits the activity of methanogens , so should be avoided . 
Furthermore, the biofilm formation can be monitored using cyclic voltammetry and op en 
circuit voltage (OCV), which could be insightful information for monitoring the activity of the 
bacteria.  
 
For analysis, liquid samples should be taken for pH/VFA/TAC analysis before application of 
electricity in order to have reference values, allowing for comparison of the activity before and 
after application of electricity.  Furthermore, liquid samples shou ld be analyzed directly after 
sampling in order to ensure accurate results .  26 
  
The data suggests that MECs systems operate well with glucose as the starting material. Future 
research may potentially use food waste as the substrate in order to give the syste m a larger 
variety and more complicated starting materials. This will aid in the applicability of the system. 
Furthermore, experiments should be repeated with a larger number of reactors and run for 
longer periods of time in order to increase the accuracy of the results. The continuous MECs 
reactor should also be repeated with control reactors for comparison.  
 
C. General analysis  
 
Further types of analysis can aid in monitoring the evolution of the reactors. The microbial 
community can be investigated using High -throughput 16s -rDNA gene sequencing and 
analysis.  This can be useful to identify differences in the culture and see the effects of different 
conditions (NH 4Cl concentration, voltages) on the growth and selectivity of different micro bial 
cultures. Furthermore, gas samples  should be analyzed  for hydrogen  and oxygen  in order to 
more accurately monitor biogas quality  and bacterial activity , giving information on which 
anaerobic pathways are active and whether there is contamination withi n the reactors.  
 
6. Conclusion  
 
The research conducted in this paper suggests that AD systems can tolerate NH 4Cl 
concentrations of  up to 12 g/L and may even aid in the stability of the reactors , but can be  toxic 
in large r concentrations.  Reactors with 10 g/L NH 4Cl performed the best for biogas production  
with 59 ml/day , but is less advantageous in biogas quality as it has the second highest mol% of 
CO 2 following reactors with 12 g/L NH 4Cl.However, a small increase to 12 g/L of NH 4Cl can 
significantly affec t the stability of the reactors and cause a ~20% decrease in the yield . Reactors 
with 4 g/L NH 4Cl resulted in the best biogas quality, with 56.7 mol% CH 4, and 43.7 mol% 
CO 2. More research is needed to see the full effects for larger concentrations such as 24 g/L. 
Research may be more accurate if a continuous reactor is used, removing human error.  
 
Batch MEC experiments with 1.34 V / 0.006 A performs the best both in terms of production 
rate and total gas production . Reactors with  0.6 V / 0 A and 0.052V/ 0 A applied voltage 
performed second best, and the gas production was higher than that of the control. The data 
suggests that the addition of a mi lli voltage is advantageous in terms of the volume of biogas 
production. However, the biogas quality slightly decreas es and overtime the reactor acidifies 
which is detrimental to the methanogenic activity. The activity of the continuous MEC reactor 
at 0.6 V / 0A has better behavior in terms of biogas yield and production rate compared to th e 
batch MEC reactors with and without electricity . The biogas quality is comparable to those of 
batch experiments  and no acidification is observed so far. Due to time constraints the operation 
of the continuous MEC reactor was stopped early, but further re search is needed to draw 
conclusive results on the reactor operation. Furthermore, a continuous system without voltage 
should be set up as a control in order to accurately compare the two systems.
