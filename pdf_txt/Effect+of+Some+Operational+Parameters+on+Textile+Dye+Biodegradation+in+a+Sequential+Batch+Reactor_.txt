Abstract  
1. Issues  
Dye containing wastewater  not effectively managed  is among the major contributors to water contamination . It is 
considered a major threat to public health and environment. Thus, it must be handled properly before discharging into 
the environment. This chapter discusses the performance evaluation of sequential batch reactor (SBR) system in 
managing  dyes. It f urther complied and analyzed the impac t of several environmental and operational parameters on 
the system in dye degradation. The various variables such as cycle time, hydraulic and sludge retention time s, aeration, 
agitation, pH, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, feeding, temperature, hydrodynamic shear force etc are described.  
 
2. Major advances  
Due to their complicated structure and synthetic root source, dyes are often regarded as one of the most dif ficult parts 
of textile wastewater to process . Environmental contamination emanating from toxic dye processing by  dyeing 
industries continues to be a challenge. All through dye degradation, a variety of methods have been used, with various 
levels of effica cy, which may be attributable to differences in dye properties, discharge conditions, technical 
potentialities, regulatory obligations, and financial thoughtfulness . Recently, the usage of SBR in dye degradation, has 
continuously receive attention from sci entists. It is widely preferred in dyes degradation because it is an efficient 
process. More so,  taking advantage of the high SBR versatility, the control parameters can be changed appropriately 
and the decolorization potential be recovered.  Owing to its o perational versatility, shock load resistance, and high 
biomass retention, this chapter emphasized SBR application and efficiency for dye treatment in the context of 
environmental conservation.  The chapter further stressed on the effects of environmental and operational parameters 
during dyes degradation. In recent decades, dye degradation has been successfully regulated by optimizing a lot of 
valuable environmental and operational parameters . They assist in the comprehension of bio -flocculation structure, 
properties, and mechanisms . These optimization strategies for environmental/operational parameters thus, paves the 
route for the produc tion of fewer by -products. The application of RSM to physi cochemical dye degradation processes 
could result in better design and optimization. Researchers focusing  on dye degradation, physicochemical processes, 
and RSM can find the outcome of this chapter extremely beneficial . Looking at the environmental aspect and 
considering the high content of hazardous intermediate metabolites found in dyes , SBR  system combined with other 
treatment technologies are more efficient for dye degradation . The content of this chapter is expected to improve 
readers' fundamental lite racy, direct research scholars, and be integrated into upcoming laboratory experiments on 
SBR systems for dye wastewater treatment.

1. Introduction  
1.1  Environmental pollution by textile industry wastewater  
Industrial operations in different mining fields, battery manufacturing, tannery, smelting, electroplating, textile, 
leather, petroleum processes, etc are described as the major sources of wastewater (Crini & Badot, 2008) . Surface 
runoff, sewer infiltration and poor management of urban solid waste also generate wastewater. Organic substances 
such as dyes present in wastewater, pose a great environmental threat for all living organism s (Abu -Ghunmi & Jamrah, 
2006) . Therefore, redu ction in effluent quantity and improving the quality would have major positive effects on land 
use and human health  (Almahbashi et al., 2020; Jagaba et al., 2019; Lotito, Di Iaconi, Fratino, Mancini, & Bergna, 
2011; Saeed et al., 2021) . 
 
1.2  Textile industry as a major dye source   
During textile production process, the industry is considered the most  resource (water and energy) intensive industry , 
thereby causing intense pollution  (Cinar, Demiroz, Kanat, Uysal, & Yaman, 2009) . It discharges large quantity of 
wastewater with complex pollutants composition (S. A. Ong, Ho, Wong, & Pakri, 2017) . Textile wastew ater resulting 
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation3 
 from a finishing, dyeing  and printing industry is a compl icated, highly heterogeneous and dynamic solution emanating 
from many polluting substances such as salts, degradable organics, enzymes,  heavy metals,  toxicants, sulfur , refractory 
organics, nutrients, heat, surfactants, basicity, suspended solids, soaps, solvents  and dyes (I. Khouni, Marrot, & Ben 
Amar, 2012; Korenak, Ploder, Trcek, Helix -Nielsen, & Petrinic, 2018; Lotito et al., 2011) .  
Conferring extremely colored water, textile wastewater usually comprises 10-200 mg/L  amount of dye , 
characterized by high temperature, alkaline pH, orga nic matter (COD) concentration, conductivity values and color 
presence  (C. S. D. Rodrigues, Madeira, & Boaventura, 2009) . Based on the aforementioned, it can be deduced that 
textile industrial wastewater c ould lead to s erious  environmental  challenges because of their  carcinogenic, mutagenic 
and toxic impacts on aquatic organi sms (Lourenco, Novais, & Pinheiro, 2006) . Therefore, prior to being released into 
the environment or any potential re cycling , it is important to treat the wastewater (Assadi, Naderi, & Mehrasbi, 2018) . 
However, it can only be reused provided conductivity and organic material are signi ficantly decreased and color  is 
eliminated  (Zuriaga -Agusti et al., 2010) . Due to a lack of water and stricter international standards , environmentally 
sustainable development in textile industry , is highly recommended  (Klepacz -Smolka et al., 2009) . This could be 
achieved through wastewater remediation and recycling to address the enormous environmental effect associated with 
the industry  (Blanco, Torrades, Moron, Brouta -Agnesa, & Garcia -Montano, 2014; Jagwani, Johnson, Datta, & 
Lakshmi, 2018) .  
 
1.3 Environmental effects of Dye  
1.3.1 Dye 
Dyeing is among the many phases of the textile process where certain compounds like dye, surfactant, salt, 
formaldehyde and metals are being used (Koupaie, Mogh addam, & Hashemi, 2012) . Dye wastewater discharged by 
dye processing plants, garment firms, plastic etc , is raising environmental concerns (Mehrali, Moghaddam, & 
Hashemi, 2010) . The dyeing sector is an extreme user of water that creates high amounts of wastewater  (Ogleni, 
Arifoglu, & Ileri, 20 12). Dyes are culpable for the presence of color in textile industrial effluents , obstructing 
photosynthetic activity and disturbing habitats in surface and groundwater systems  (Franca et al., 2015) . 
Dyes are often regarded as perhaps the most troublesome components of textile wastewater to be processed 
due to their synthetic origins and complex structure (S. A.  Ong, Ho, Wong, & Raman, 2012) . It is possible to classify 
dyes based on their solubility and chemical characteristics  (Baloo et al., 2021) . The common kinds  can be grouped as  
direct, reactive, azo,  acidic  and basic dyes (Karimifard & Moghaddam, 2018) . Phthalocyanine derivatives, 
triphenylmethyl, indigoid, azo anthraquinone  and sulphur are the chemical dyes commonly used on an industrial level 
(S. A. Ong, Toorisaka, Hirata, & Hano, 2012) . In the textile industry, fixation of dyes to fabrics par tly befalls, thereby 
producing highly colored wastewater (Cinar et al., 2008; Menezes et al., 2019) . Dyes wastewater usually contain ing 
refractory dyes and organic chemicals,  and their metabolite derivatives are mutagenic and toxic that can hang in the 
air for a long duration  (Bashiri, Fallah, Bonakdarpour, & Elyasi, 2018; L. L. Zhang, Sun, Guo, Wu, & Jiang, 2012) .  
 
1.3.2 Effect of dye on environment  
Environmental contamination emanating from toxic dye processing by dyeing industries continues to be a challenge 
(S. A. Ong, Toorisaka, Hirata, & Hano, 2008; S. Sirianuntapiboon,  Chairattanawan, & Jungphungsukpanich, 2006) . 
Dye discharge in aqueous streams not only affects the clarity of natural water and its aesthetic value in terms of color, 
but can also hinder s the penetration of sunlight, thus decreasing photosynthetic activity and oxygen bioavailability , 
restricts the use o f water and can have a toxic impact on marine life (Azizi, Moghaddam, Maknoon, & Kowsari, 2015; 
Santos & Boaventura, 2015) . It can also cause hemolytic anemia, hy perbilirubinemia, acute renal failure cancer and 
mutation in humans (Ma et al., 2011) . In general, because of its resistant nature, the considerable quantity of dyes used 
during the dyeing phase of textile production increases the environmental hazard.  To break off the health, aesthetic, 
and environmental issues emanating from  the incessant discharge of contaminated dye wastewater , its treatment has 
become a complicated environmental problem. (Koupaie, Moghaddam, & Hashemi, 2013b) . Therefore, developing 
an efficient treatment technique in terms of managing inadequate water supplies and as well the call for environmental 
conservation becomes paramount (Koupaie, Moghaddam, & Hashemi, 2013a) .  
 
1.3.3 Treatment of dye  
Treatment system capable of COD, color  and conductivity value reduction in dyes wastewater seem to be of great 
importance in order to recycle the final effluent (Farabegoli, Chiavola, Rolle, & Naso, 2010) . But , due to dye 
wastewater's inhibitory and recalcitrant behavior , it is usually not appropriate to apply traditional biological 
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation4 
 wastewater treatment  as most of the colored dye substances with large molecular mass are immune to biodegradation  
(Al-Amrani, Lim, Seng, & Ngah, 2014; S. V. Mohan, Rao, & Sarma, 2009) . Strategies ot her than the conventional 
ones employed for dye containing wastewater degradation for possible reuse categorized into physicochemical, 
biological and combined systems  have been reviewed  in recent times  (Khosravi, Karimi, Ebrahimi, & Fallah, 2020) . 
According to literature, the numerous physicochemical methods used for decolorization of dyeing effluents include  
coagulation/flocculation, flotation, precipitation, photocatalytic degradation, ultrafiltration, pyrolyzed petrified 
sediment, membrane processes, electrochemical processes, ion exchange, adsorption, electrolysis, nanofiltration, 
reverse osmosis, irradiati on and chemical/photochemical/advanced oxidation are common practices (Koupaie et al., 
2013a; Lotito et al.,  2011; Lucas, Peres, & Pigments, 2006; S. A. Ong, Toorisaka, et al., 2012) . However, these 
methods are faced with one or more disadvantages of : (i) operational problems, limited versatility, economical 
unviability and environmental unfriendliness, (ii) generation of huge quantity of hazardous sludge, adsorbent 
regeneration, chemical waste generation and membrane fouling, (iii) quite inefficient,  complicated, expensive, 
pollutants phase transfer with toxic intermediates, (iv) high operating costs and energy consumption (v) interference 
by other wastewater constituents (Assadi et al., 2018; Cinar et al., 2008; Hakimelahi, Moghaddam, & Hashemi, 2012)  
In a review by (Chiavola, 2012) , it was concluded that biological treatment method s are effective, reliable,  
eco-friendly,  energy saving, financially appealing dye degradation techniques with minimum chemicals usage 
requirement. According to (S. Sirianuntapiboon & Sansak, 2008) , color substances in dyestuffs contaminated water is 
a sort of refractory organic material, that can either be solubilized or utilized by microorganisms in traditional 
biological treatm ent systems as sources of energy and carbon. High concentration of influent color  can induce partial 
inhibition of microorganisms that degrade color . Colorant removal mechanisms in biological systems are  either  based 
on degradation,  adsorption or both (S. Sirianuntapiboon et al., 2006) .  
In biological treatment systems , a broad variety of microorganisms, particularly bacteria, algae, yeast and 
fungi,  are capable of de -staining and degrading many types of dyes  with bacteria and fungi as the most intensively 
researched (Al-Amrani et al., 2014; Cirik, Kitis, & Cinar, 2013; L. L. Zhang et al., 2012) . Aerobic systems a s part of  
the various biological processes are commonly utilized  for dye degradation . Unfortunately, treatment is normally 
insufficient. Interestingly, the anaerobic systems can handle large amounts of organic matter, as many dyes are 
susceptible to reductive change in anaerobic environments . Therefore, hybrid aerobic and anerobic process is 
sufficient for the accomplishment of both color degradation and dye molecule d isintegration (Farabegoli et al. , 2010) . 
In the hybrid environment, dye elimination is usually achieved through bond cleavage, as a result, colorless  and 
dangerous aromatic amines are formed, along with metabolite biodegradation (Santos & Boaventura, 2015) . 
The typical biological wastewater treatment methods such as activated sludge process, pure culture of 
decolorizer, oxidation ponds, aerated lagoons and sequencing batch reactors produces less sludge (Buitron, Martinez, 
& Vargas, 2006; Yu et al., 2015) . Recently, the usage of SBR in dye containing wastewater treatment, has continuously 
receive attention from scientists because it is an efficient process for wastewater treatment . SBR is widely  preferred 
in dyes containing wastewater  treatment  (Ogleni et al., 2012) . More so,  taking advantage of the high SBR versatility, 
the control parameters can be changed appropriately and the decolorization potential be recovered  (Moghaddam & 
Moghaddam, 2016) .  
 
2. Sequen tial Batch Reactor (SBR) system for dye degradation  
2.1  Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR)  
SBRs are a batch -operated form of the activated -sludge process, in which the various conditions are all met at varying 
periods in a single reactor, basin, or tank. The different treatment stages are performed at fixed and programmable 
periods, forming a cy cle (Maqbool et al., 2020) . The process is divided into five (5) steps: filling, reaction, settling, 
drawing, and idling, with aeration and clarification in between. When aeration is turned off and a drainage system is 
used to remove the supernatant liquor, sludge settles  (A. H. Jagaba et al., 2021) . The process design of the SBR system 
is a function of the influent load, biomass mass and settleability, reac tor capacity, aeration system, and the fractions 
of the overall cycle allotted for the individual treatment steps (Bungay, Humphries, & Stephenson, 2007).  SBRs are 
furnished with diffusers, inlet and outlet valves, oxygen supplying kit’s and mechanical sludge out take devices to 
effectively regulate the system (Mahvi, 2008) . 
SBR as an alternative to conventional suspended growth wastewater treatment system is a sludge activation 
mechanism that has been tweaked to integrate both aerobic and anaerobic phases in a single unit for enhanced COD 
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation5 
 and dye degradation (Hakimelahi et al., 2012; Sathian, Rajasimman, Radha, Shanmugapriya, & Karthikeyan, 2014) . 
It solves bulking sludge and low -density bio -sludge problems caused by clarifier large capacity (Ogleni et al., 2012) .  
The traditional SBR is a crucial process for nitrification -denitrification, in which ammonia is initially oxidized  to 
nitrite, followed by the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate and the formation of nitrogen gas  (Santos & Boaventura, 2015) .  
SBR has been widely adopted landfill leachate, phenolic compounds, nutrients  and various dyes (Al-Amrani et al., 
2014) . It has a long history of usage in the treatment of textile waste , particular ly for azo dyes elimination because 
they allow the fungal activity to be maintained over extended  duration  and may achieve better results in dye 
decolorization when compared with batch cultivation (Lourenco et al., 2006) . A According to (Ogleni et al., 2012) , 
SBRs are extremely effective in textile industrial wastewater degradation for organic matter, nutrients and dying 
materials  (Ng, Wong, Kutty, & Jagaba, 2021) .  
Several kinds of SBR under diverse operational conditions have been largely examined f or whole dyes bio -
decolorization/mineralization  in literature. These include; aerobic, sequential anaerobic –aerobic, sequential anoxic –
aerobic bioreactors  and sequential aerobic –anaerobic SBR s (Al-Amrani et al., 2014; Imen Khouni, Marrot, Amar, & 
Technology, 2012; S Venkata Mohan, Rao, & Sarma, 2007; S. -A. Ong, Toorisaka, Hirata, & Hano, 2005) . Common 
aerobic methods utilized  in textile wastewater treatment have been discovered not  to be successful in degradi ng dyes 
and exceeding  the biomass's adsorption capacity; this may be due to the dyes' bio -resistant nature  (Singh, LeBlanc, & 
Bhattacharyya, 2008) .  In contrast to that, anaerobic SBR  for treati ng dye  degradation  has proved  to be further efficient 
than the aerobic SBRs  that mostly accommodate  organic chemicals and refractory dyes (L. L. Zhang et al., 2012) .  
 
2.2  Factors  that affect SBR  systems  
Influent sample characteristics  such as dissolved oxygen ( DO), hydraulic retention time  (HRT ), carbon source, pH, 
redox potential (ORP ), sludge retention time ( SRT), feed pattern, organic loading rate, anoxic/oxic ratio, temperature, 
cycle duration and settleability are a ll variables that can impact SBR system efficiency  (Rollemberg et al., 2019) . In 
concurrent N and P removal systems, low temperature is rated a serious problem and is studied since it affects 
microbial activity in activated sludge negatively (Sekine, Akizuki, Kish i, & Toda, 2018) . Although the SBR operation 
is economical, its service needs added proficiency and responsiveness. More so, SBR consistency creates issues like 
bulking, sludge foaming and trouble reaching the same starting conditions . It makes biologic al reactions gauging 
carried out  with standard procedures  more difficult . Operational difficulties such as COD fluctuations are also 
common during system operation (Ogleni et al., 2012) . In other to curtail the effect of the aforementioned factors, 
several approaches have been adopted by researchers to address the weak performance of the aerobic biological 
elimination of dyes . These include:  combining SBR with nanofiltration membrane, coupling photo -Fenton wi th SBR, 
integrating SBR with photocatalysis, coupled biological SBR -PAC adsorption systems, utilizing GAC to support 
biofilm attachment and use of novel bacterial consortia  (Hosseini Koupaie, Alavi Moghaddam, Hashemi, & 
technology, 2013; Imen Khouni et al., 2012; Lim, Er, & Chemistry, 2000; C. S. Rodrigues, Madeira, & Boaventura, 
2014; Suntud Sirianuntapiboon, Sadahiro, & Salee, 2007) . 
 
2.3  Merits of the SBR system  
In terms of textile/dye wastewater decolorization, SBR offers the following advantages : (i) need small footprint and a 
single basin activity with no demand for a secondary clarifier (A. Jagaba et al., 2021) , operates automatically with 
better process control abilities (ii) design, configuration, and process are simple and versatile  (Al-Amrani et al., 2014; 
Cinar et al., 2008) , cheap operation and installation charges  (Mojiri, Ohashi, Ozaki, & Kindaichi, 2018) , great bulking 
control and high tolerance to different shock loads (S. Y. Li, Fei, Cao, & Chi, 2019) , (iii) high organic and dye removal 
efficiencies (S. Sirianuntapiboon et al., 2006) , (iv) greater reaction rate at the onset of reaction  (Yu et al., 2015) , (v) 
less accumulation of toxic bio -degradable intermedia tes, (vi)  volume required for continuous flow system is almost 
twice that required for corresponding fill -and-draw system (Abu -Ghunmi & Jamrah, 2006) , (vii) concurrent organics, 
nitrogen, and phosphorus removal,  elevated biomass retention, robustness, toxicity resistance, lower power 
consumption, and breaking up of SRT from HRT  (Fongsatitkul, Elefsiniotis, Yamasmit, & Yamasmit, 2004; Lemus -
Gomez, Martinez -Trujillo, Membrillo -Venegas, & Garcia -Rivero, 2018; Mace, Mata -Alvarez, & Research, 2002) . 
Most of the aforementioned advantages could also be  attained through microorganisms utilization (S. A. Ong, 
Toorisaka, et al.,  2012)  for dyes degradation from industrial discharge . SBR operational flexibility is convenient for 
dye effluents degradation, considering the fact that reaction time could be linked to the feed load with seldom organic 
loads . The system  do allow settling time to be manipulated but also enables single pulse feeding, leading to an 
undesirable inventory of transient carbon substrates for filamentous bacterial growth  (Albuquerque, Lopes, 
Serralheiro, Novais, & Pinheiro, 2005) . 
 
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation6 
 3. Environmental and operational parameters effects on SBR system  
In recent decades, many valuable environmental and operational variables for dye degradation  have been successfully 
implemented (Ye et al., 2009) . These variables have a strong influence on the effectiveness of the SBR system, as 
such, there is a direct correlation among the variables and treatment efficiency. These can be determined by looking 
at how they affect biological nitrification, denitrification and dephosphatation, as well as, substrate storage and 
utilization, population an d structure of microbial communities, biofilm formation, granulation and toxicity (Liao, 
Droppo, Leppard, & Liss, 2006) . More so , they aid in the understanding floc structure, properties, and bioflocculation 
mechanisms. Therefore, the implications of these variables should be studied in depth for the purpose of establishing 
a reliable and  effective biological treatment process (L. Tan, Qu, Zhou, Ma, & Li, 2 010). Table 1 compiles the 
efficiency of different dye -treatment reactors. This is to explicitly indicate the role of several operational and 
environmental variables on dye degradation in an SBR system. The table further state the optimal conditions att ained 
for each parameter during each experimental study.  It was clear from literature that the majority of the treatments 
were aimed at removing color and COD.  
 
3.1 Cycle time  
Eq. (1) is used to describe a loop in SBR, where an entire cycle duration ( tC) is the sum of the fill, react, settle, decant, 
and idle times.  
tC = tF + tR + tS + tD + tI                                                                       (1) 
where,  
tF = fill time (h),  
tS = settle time (h),  
tR = react time (h),  
tI = idle time (h) and  
tD = decant time (h) (Thakur, Mall, & Srivastava, 2013) . 
The effect of the cycle duration has been seldom investigated. It can be seen that the continuous reduction in 
cycle duration led to an improvement in biomass composition as a result  of a more plentiful organic portion  (Khalil 
& Liu, 2021) . Operating an optimized cycle time SBR system could possibly support sludge particles agglomeration 
with improved settleability and maintain comparable COD and color removal. Excellen t phosphorus removal was 
observed at a short cycle length. This may be attributed to higher rate of nitrogen eliminated  through the nitrite route , 
which renders biodegradable carbon more available . However, as the cycle length rose, the system's phosphorus 
percentage removal decreased due to the need  for biodegradable organic carbon denitrification  continued to increase 
in conjunction with total nitrification (Ginige, Kayaalp, Cheng, Wylie, & Kaksonen, 2013) .  
An aerobic SBR employed as a post treatment to anaerobically treat mixture of three different dyes has the 
potential to farther remove pollutants from wastewater. The SBR demonstrated  the ability to handle the dye mixture 
at variable cycle times where the cycle duration of 12 hours was observed to be the best at producing excellent effluen t 
while still adhering to SS and COD regulatory limits (Singh et al., 2008) . In similar research for azo dye remazol 
brilliant violet 5R (RBV -5R) treatment , it has been revealed that reducing anaerobic cycle time did not alter the 
systems color removal rate. The best SBR efficacy  for color  and aromatic amine degradation was achieved after a 
total cycle period of 24 hours. The efficiency of COD removal was harmed when the total cycle length was reduced 
from 48 to 24 hours (Cinar et al., 2008) . However, shortening cycle duration from 24h to 8 h did not affect the 
decolorization r ate as reported by (Assadi et al., 2018) .  
 
3.2  HRT  
HRT could be regarded as a measure of the mean duration whereby wastewater lived in a bioreactor system. The HRT 
computation for an SBR system is given by:  
𝐻𝑅𝑇 =(𝑡C) 
𝑉F/𝑉T 1
24                                             (2) 
where VF in Eq. (2) represents the amount of wastewater filled and collected effluent for a full cycle, VT  represents 
the reactor's total working volume, and tC represents the total cycle length (Thakur et al., 2013) . HRT is an important 
parameter in biological wastewater and hydrogen production processes  (Srisuwun et al., 2018) . Increment in HRT 
offer ample time  for COD and other system intermediates fractional mineralization (Assadi et al., 2018) . For dyestuff 
wastewater treatment using only biological system as SBR, longer HRT is required (X. Xu et al., 2012) .  
 Color removal performance of a GAC -SBR system has been reported to be high and stable at an increased 
HRT (S. Sirianuntapiboon & Chairattanawan, 2016) . The rise in HRT primarily needed under low temperatures 
triggers decreased concentration of biomass, endogenous decay rate, specif ic growth rate and yield of biomass. 
Therefore, mindful attention should be given to the choice of the optimal HRT for efficient SBR application in dye 
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation7 
 wastewater treatment (S. Sirianuntapiboon & Chairattanawan, 2012) . HRT can be lowered where possible by 
incorporating membrane modules that enh ance system operating flux and permeability . With a decrease in HRT, the 
specific nitrate reduction rates, specific nitrite and ammonium oxidation rates, sludge volume index and specific 
oxygen absorption rates all inflate.  Therefore,  causing  a reduction in microbial population through the  biomass 
washout, continual HRT lowering could further degrade system efficiency (Lotito, Fratino, Mancini, Bergna, & Di 
Iaconi, 2012) .  
 
3.3 SRT  
In an activated sludge process, SRT is an important design and opera ting variable for controlling process parameters, 
such as effluent water quality, nitrification, sludge volume, oxygen demand, and growth status  (S. N. Xu, Wu, & Hu, 
2014) . It refers to how long an organism settles in a bioreactor on average.  According to literature,  to keep organism s 
alive in a b atch reactor, the level of net growth must be ≥ the SRT.  
SRT can indeed be calculated mathematically using the equation below:  
𝑆𝑅𝑇 =𝑉 𝑥 𝑋r 
𝑄 𝑥 𝑋e                        (3) 
where  
V = useful reactor capacity ;  
Q = effluent quantity per day ;  
Xr and Xe = influent & effluent VSS concentration (Sekine et al., 2018) . 
SRT obta ined from Eq. (3) can be managed by activated sludge wasting regularly. The equation can be 
utilized to calculate the waste volume:  
𝑄𝑤=𝑉  
𝑆𝑅𝑇                                                                                                                                                       (4) 
where:  
Qw in Eq. ( 4) = suspended solids  wasting rate , L/d;  
V = working capacity of the reactor , L (Esparza -Soto, Nunez -Hernandez, & Fall, 2011) . 
In biological nutrient remova l operations, SRT could be utilized to change the microbial population. It takes 
a much longer duration to achieve huge nitritation rates as SRT is raised . The nitrification start -up period would be 
shortened because of the comparatively short SRT. Shorter SRTs have a higher nitrite accumulating rate (NAR) . 
Diverse floc morphology may result from using an SBR at varying SRTs. Low SRTs are associated with une ven 
sludge floc morphology .  
Divergent SRTs are likely to have significant differences in effluent SS rates. The potential of the sludge to 
flocculate varies, this depends on SRT. A study treating Acid Red 14 showcases the ability of SRT versatility to 
eliminate color  by azo dye depletion in activated granular sludge systems. SRT regulation to 15 days led to 30% 
decrease in color removal  rate. Nonetheless , increasing SRT to >25 days regressed the impact and aided the total 
bioconversion of the known aromati c amine through the aerobic reaction period (Franca et al., 2015) . In another related 
study treating highly concentrated dye in an AnSBR, the system efficiency maintained firmness for 30 days at short 
HRT and long SRT  (Srisuwun et al., 2018) . 
 
3.4 Feeding  
This is the process of loading a reactor with dye wastewater combined with biomass for microbial activity, 
whether by pumping or by gravity among reactors at low and high -water levels. Aerated, static, and mixed fill are all 
fill strategies that can be managed by a time controller.  Continuous vs. pulse feeding does not alter the biomass -
dominant bacteria greatly (Ciggin, Rossetti, Maj one, & Orhon, 2012) . It is of note that, what reactor is fed with (carbon 
source) and its concentration significantly matters in SBR system during dye degradation.  Because of dye wastewater 
complexity, external carbon sources sometimes referred to as co -substrates are usually employed for the sustenance 
of the reactor (Sirlanuntapboon, Sadahiro, & Salee, 2007) .  
Adding Thai rice noodle wastewater increase d dye removal efficiency by 30% (S. Sirianuntapiboon & 
Sansak, 2008) . Discussing about co -substrate and its efficacy, it has been noted that the Reactive Black 5 removal 
efficiency was enhanced as influent co -substrate concentration increased (S. A. Ong,  Ho, et al., 2012) . Increasing OLR 
has been proven that it increases dye removal efficiency but deteriorate s COD (Kocyigit & Ugurlu, 2015) . It is a 
general observation that high initial dye concentrations can cause a reduction in dye percentage removal. This implies 
that volumetric loading rate can affect dye removal efficiency in SBR (I. Khouni et al., 2012) . Dyes removal efficiency 
of a bioreactor system is said to decrease with increase in influent dye concentration (S. Sirianuntapiboon & Sansak, 
2008) .  
 
3.5 Shock loads  
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation8 
 An abundance of particulate organic matter s might sometimes be nourished to SBRs, which could require extra HRT  
to process . Therefore, i t becomes  important to analyze a batch reactor s efficiency at shock loading s tate when dealing 
with dyes since it is complicated wastewater. Sudden unplanned changes in influent concentration, also known as 
organic shock loading, can cause treatment efficacy to be disrupted over time. Shock loa ding causes stress to the 
bioreactor. This can be standardized by incorporating surplus common co -substrates  (Khalaf, Ibrahim, Fayed, & 
Eloffy, 2021) . The experimental recuperation time is usually longer than the theoretical recuperation time throughout 
shock loading . This may be because of the toxic compounds available in the wastewater having an inhibitory effect 
(Mizzouri & Shaa ban, 2013) .  
Hydraulic , organic , toxic and combined loads are examples of typical shock loads . The toxic shock load 
occurs by the use of organic solvents to raise pollutant concentrations in a batch reactor blended well above activated 
sludge process's threshold level. Various COD concentrations can be applied at different time interludes to produce 
organic shock load. By adulterating the reactor wastewater, differences in COD concentrations can be produced. 
Reducing HRTs of stressed batch reactors gener ates hydraulic shock loads. This causes a major constraint for the 
reaction rate.  For the combined shock load, two (2 )  or three (3) of the above state shocks are concurrently applied to 
the reactor, with varying intensity levels at given cycles, and the r eactor's efficacy in wastewater treatment is then 
assessed (Mizzouri & Shaaban, 2013) . Organic loading of 0.56 and 0.75 Kg COD/cum -day rates have exhibited less 
impact on the treatment of Acid black 210, as the reactor effectiveness was not restrained at the examined loading 
rates (S. V. Mohan et al., 2009) . 
 
3.6 Agitation  
The degree of agitation is critical for creating better mixing environments, solubilizing suspended organic compounds, 
and enhancing mass transfer. These characteristics contribute to a higher rate of substrate consumption, which can 
shorten the total cycle time . Mechanical stirring, biogas and liquid recirculation can all be used to provide agitation in 
an SBR system. The dynamics of v olatile acid production and utilization were clearly changed by increasing mass 
transfer resistance, enabling the device to achieve different observable steady states at a lower rate of agitation  (Alami, 
Alasad, Ali, & Alshamsi, 2021) . A research reveals that the production of biogas was insufficient to increase the 
turbulence required to minimize the occurrence of possible fixed zones as well as mass transfer resistance. As a result, 
an anaerobic SBR was produced , with agitation provide d by diaphragm pump recirculation of the effluent. Authors 
conclud ed that effluent recirculation can be used as a method of agitation.  The maximal recirculation velocity for an 
AnSBR device utilized during wastewater treatment was tested to assess the effe ctiveness of recirculation. When the 
machine was operating at lower speeds, mass transfer was found to be a constraint. Higher velocities, on the other 
hand, can reduce microbial activity due to excessive shearing, which can harm the flocs in the biomass a nd trigger 
granule rupture, resulting in poor solid separation (Maurina et al., 2014) .  
 
3.7 Aeration  
In aerobic sludge granulation, aeration is a very important parameter  (D. Xu et al., 2021) . Sluggish aeration levels in 
SBRs might lower overall nitrite and nitrate levels, lowering the carbon demand of denitrifying bacteria and resulting 
in far more carbon sources being prepared for denitrification processes . The oxygen -deplete d environment can 
enhance dye biodegradability and lessen refractory substances toxicity , allowing nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria 
to develop in the SND phase longer. According to the literature, a higher aeration rate helps in rapid aerobic 
granulati on (Azizi et al ., 2015) . To maintain the stability of aerobic granules, it is also necessary to render adequate 
hydraulic sharpening power to prevent filamentous bacteria overgrowth. However, it has some drawbacks, including 
high costs due to energy demand, inability to remove TN, degradation of anaerobic conditions, and low phosphorus 
removal, among others . A traditional SBR system's aeration process can be changed, resulting in an intermittent 
aeration SBR, which is described as a mechanism in which anoxic and aerobi c environments are formed by 
intermittently redoing aeration and non -aeration cycles . The key benefits of using intermittent aeration in SBRs entail 
improved nitrogen removal and lower operating costs.  
Micro -aeration strategies tested for  Direct Black 22 tetra-azo dye treatment has enhanced aromatic amine 
reduction and ecotoxicity. The uninterrupted  micro -aeration resulted in four times greater oxygen consumption 
compared to the intermittent phase. However, intermittent micro -aeration attached to anaerobic digestion became  the 
better choice with far l ower  oxygen intake compared to the undisturbed  micro -aeration process and an extraordinary 
total acute ecotoxicity removal (Menezes et al., 2019) . Studying the effect of aeration in Reactive yellow 15 dyes 
degradation  at microaerophilic and anaerobic states , the removal of dye was greater than the aerobic conditions, with 
robust removal of dye for elevated YD concentrations.  In the anoxic period, azo dye, ammonium, organic carbo n 
concentrations were significantly reduced  treating dye wastewaters in bioreactors  (Sarvajith, Reddy, & Nancharaiah, 
2018) . In a related study using Reactive Blue 21 (RB21) dye, the aerob ic phase could not significantly eliminate RB21 
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation9 
 and greatest dye degradation  happened in the anaerobic stage . Given the phthalocyanine dye's high solubility and 
molecular structure strength , microorganisms were unable to significantly affect RB21 molecules  during the short 
anaerobic duration of 4h . Surprisingly, surfactant and COD degradation were significantly improved at the high 
aerobic phase 17h (Khosravi et al., 2020) . Successful color biodegradation for mono -azo dye  Reactive Red 195 (RR 
195) has been stated to befall under anaerobic conditions (Farabegoli et al., 2010)  . 
 
3.8 Salinity  
Salinity is regarded as one of the major elements that can affect the production and composition of EPS. Osmotic 
pressure usually generated by salinity may trig ger the microorganisms to produce exopolysaccharides (Z. C. Wang et 
al., 2013) . It can inhibit cell enlargement and division directly or indirectly. The development, effectiveness and 
efficiency of wastewater treatment systems can also be hindered. Increasing salinity in an SBR reactor substantially 
affects system performance negatively , leading to the collapse of the reactor ecosystem . It releases cellular materials, 
amounting to soluble COD increase and capable of affecting happily acclimated microorganisms to a steady salinity.  
The SBR system is delicate about salinity shock, and it is difficult for the main anti -salt microbes to resp ond well to 
a higher salt concentration range instantly. However, it is contradictory that some scholars claim that increasing 
wastewater salinity may boost SVI, while others insist that salinity increase could result to SVI reduction.  High salinity 
is req uired for a batch reactor  to attain  a steady short -cut nitrogen elimination  as the process rapidly changes to partial 
nitrification. However, results in stronger inhibition as it can repress NOB and  AOB population.  
High salinity also  have powerful inhibit ion on the activated sludge's phosphorus degradation and nitrification 
capacity  (Ye et al., 2009) . It also contributes to soluble microbial  products aggregation and decreases effluent quality.  
The increase effluent suspended solid concentration, disintegration of activated sludge flocs, decline of organic matter 
removal rate, increase of buoyancy force and inhibition of bacterial metabolism are ways by which salinity negatively 
affects an SBR tr eatment system. A study by (Wu, Guan, & Zhan, 2008)  revealed that, although microbial community 
structure is greatly influenced by salinity, SBRs performance in terms of organic matter extraction is not affected by 
high salinity. Efficient methods for saline wastewater treatment have been established by  the combination of fluidized 
bed with activated  sludge process, cultivation of marine activated sludge utilizing  sea mud, and incorporation of high 
salt-resistant  bacteria . Increased aeration rate, reasonably prolonged aeration time or the inclusion  of ha lotolerant 
bacteria may also increase the degradation of dye (Chen et al., 2018) . 5 
Hyper -salinity wastewater, as previously mentioned, commonly induced plasmolysis and/or loss of cell 
function, leading to detrimental consequences on biological treatment techn iques. It could be described that azo dye 
was suitable for the production of a rare presiding species  under lower -salt conditions and played a significant part in 
the arrangement of the microbial community. However, certain halophilic & salt-tolerant species may be enhanced 
during acclimatization  as salinity is elevated.  Decolorization of KE -3B was partly impaired under high salt 
environments, as the decolorization consortium was more susceptible to high salt concentrations . On the contra ry, 
limited impact was witnessed on K -2G decolorization. More so,  with the rise in NaCl concentration, microbial 
diversity  proved to be more prevalent for both dyes (L. Tan et al., 2010) . In a related study treating Direct Blue 85 
(DB), NaCl exhibited an insignificant impact on the adsorption intensity  (Santos & Boaventura, 2015) . Treating Basic 
Red 46 in an SBR system, COD a nd color degradation rates reduced  with rising nitrate ion and salt concentration in 
the wastewater  (Assadi et al., 2018) . Adding PACl to an SBR system treating Reactive Blue 19 enhanced effluent TSS 
and had no notable impact on effluent dyes, COD and turbidity  (Mehrali et al., 2010) . 
 
3.9  pH 
The pH value of BNR system responds to microorganisms' cell membrane permeability and electrical charge. pH 
directly impacts on microorganism growth and activity in the environment significantly. It is crucial in ensuring the 
prevailing position of useful bacteria in the wastewater treatment methods. As high concentration nitrate containing 
wastewater denitrification is controlled by pH, metal toxicity also depends pH. While studying the connection amongst 
pH and the degradation of biological phosphorus, th e capacity of anoxic phosphate uptake was observed to be 
enhanced by pH rise for denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms (DNPAOs) sludge. Low pH can be raised 
by the alkalinity generation in a treatment process (W. Li et al., 2019) . To improve SBR performance, detail of the 
microbial po pulation dynamics under different pH is required.  
 
3.10 Alkalinity  
Alkalinity is strongly associated with nitrogen loss. It exhibits a linear reverse interaction with concentration of the 
effluent nitrogen. Another benefit for alkalinity is the simplicity and ease of testing with test kits. Alkalinity < 100 
mg/L does not portray adequate denitrification, while values greater than 250 mg/L indicates inadequate nitrification. 
Alkalinity test is usually carried out in an SBR system to observe the system operat ional situation and subsequently 
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation10 
 show the end of nitrification/denitrification. Nevertheless, there is currently no real -time alkalinity evaluation. 
Samples of wastewater had to be obtained from treatment plants and weighed by titration, resulted in severa l minutes 
time lag. Alkalinity variation amongst influent and effluent (∆Alk inf.-eff.) can be employed for 
nitrification/denitrification lengths  indicator. The influent and effluent alkalinity difference theoretical values can be 
computed as:  
∆Alk theory = 3.57([NH 4+]inf.+ [NO 2−]eff. + [NO 3−]eff. − [NH 4+]eff.) (mg /L)                  (5) 
since nitrate and nitrite  are mostly less than influent limit, they cannot be incorporated in Eq. ( 5). 
Alkalinity difference resulting from laboratory experiment can thus be  computed as:  
∆Alk exper . = Alkalinity inf. − Alkalinity eff. (mg/L)              (6) 
∆Alk exper . in Eq. ( 6) above was weighed up with ∆Alk theory for ∆Alk  accuracy which indicates nitrogen extraction. The 
existence of alkalinity consumption and formation in a single tank of an SBR system could minimize the difference 
in alkalinity between the influent and the effluent (B. K. Li & Irvin, 2007) . 
 
3.11 DO 
DO concentration can be measured by microelectrodes to provide important details for SBR optimization. The DO 
concentration is said to be the most important factor in regulating SND activity SBR. It also affects granular sludge 
formation and aerobic granul ar system stability (S. A. Ong et al., 2008) . Thus, altering the DO concentration could 
alter the  aerobic zone and subsequently the  bacterial community structure within  the reactor. As increased levels of 
DO ensures total nitrification and eliminate organic carbon, a low DO state is fit for achieving high degree SND  (H. 
Y. Wang et al., 2018) . Lessened aeration levels are said to be beneficial for conserving energy and denitrification 
stimulation  (Yan et al., 2019) .   
In a study where DO concentration was varied during aerobic s tage, the influent solids decreased DO levels  
in the aerobic period from 2 -0.8 mg/L and improved phosphorus removal efficiency. However, it consequentially 
reduced the nitrification levels proving deficiency of oxygen (Ginige et al., 2013) . For the biodegradation of Acid Red 
18 (AR18) dye, aerobic conditions with a 5 -6 mg/L DO concentration were not adequate (Moghaddam & Moghaddam, 
2016) . When the effect of oxygen on the anaerobic biodegradation capacity of blended microbial culture for remazol 
brilliant violet 5R was investigated, increa sed oxygen supply had a negative effect on anaerobic color  removal 
efficiency and azo reductase activity of anaerobic microorganisms.  In the SBR dyes removal, molecular oxygen was 
said to have greatly decreased color  removal  (Cinar et al., 2009) . Similarly, t he increase of DO up to 3.5 mg/L did not 
reveal any effect on color removal by the SBR system treating Acid Orange 7 (S. A. Ong et al., 2008) .  
 
3.12 Temperature  
The sustenance and growth of microorganisms alongside anaerobic degradation of organic substance are highly 
affected by temperature. As temperature decreases, enzymatic and chemical re actions slow down leading to total 
growth termination. Temperature have a significant effect on nitrogen elimination community structure in the 
anammox SBR with NLR, even though it has no impact on granular biomass integrity sustentation and anammox 
sludge  grown on biofilm. Temperature decrease could transform floccular sludge microbial community structure (Q. 
Li et al., 2018) . Great TN and SNDPR performance removal can be accomplished at less temperature (C. Li, Liu, Ma, 
Zheng, & Ni, 2019) . However, the functions of activated sludge microbes could be negatively affected by low 
temperature . It has been reported that the SBR system faces numerous hurdles at temperature ≤ 10oC. This results to 
the declination of denitrification and nitrification levels because of the destabilized microbial activities. Decreasing 
temperature can result to oversaturated DO, which hinders anoxic denitrification conduct (L. Q. Zhang et al., 2009) .  
 
3.13 ORP  
A significant determinant that may affect the biodegradability of resolute micro -pollutants is the redox environment. 
ORP as a control parameter is essential for treatment process effectiveness optimizatio n. According to literature, the 
existing redox conditions for an SBR system are: fully aerobic, anoxic/aerobic, and microaerobic (Albuquerque et al., 
2005) . An Orion OR P Probe are mostly used for measuring ORP. In engineering application, the accuracy of ORP for 
on-line monitoring is below expectation which could be due to the low pH sensitivity to nitrogen concentrations, probe 
fouling and difficulties in identifying br eakpoints in ORP profiles comprising numerous factors (B. K. Li & Irvin, 
2007) . Consu mption of oxidized nitrogen forms and residual DO can lead to decrease in ORP value, thereby changing 
the protein configuration within the system. Depending on sensor signal change, ORP reduction can be regulated 
either by raising/lowering the airflow or b y switching the aeration on/off (Stadler et al., 2015) . With and without the 
involvement of co -substrates and nutrients, ORP monitoring was performed in an ANSBR . The extremely active 
anaerobic biomass found could be due to the bioreactor low ORP values (S. A. Ong, Toorisaka, et al., 2012) .  
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation11 
 Adding variable sulfate quantity to a reactor for Remazol Brilliant R5 treatment changes the ORP values 
because of sulfate reduction. Larger quantity of sulphate inclusion in bioreactors with lower ORP values have a 
positive  effect  on azo dye biodegradation. Authors  conclude d that, the most appropriate ORP values for color removal 
is anything below -150 mV (Cirik et al., 2013) . In a related study, it was observed that sulfate supplementation into 
bioreactors fed with acid dye led to sulphate decrease. However , decolorization was not improved (Albuquerque et 
al., 2005) . In an SBR treating azo dye AO7, ORP made it easier to regulate the aerobic and anaerobic phases, as the 
lone control variable (Buitron et al., 2006) .  
 
3.14 C/N/P ratios   
Microbial breakdown of dyes molecules largely relies on the quantity of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus ready for 
their activity . Even though bacteria cannot produce necessary enzymes required for carbon utilization with small 
amount of nitrogen, large amount of nitrogen can inhibit  the bacterial growth (H. Y. Wang et al., 2018) . The 
availability and nature of electron donor, convenie ntly denoted in terms of C/N ratio, performs a significant role in 
biological denitrification (Jin et al., 2013) . It is a factor in the control of the denitrification efficiency, that guides in 
the design and configuration of the procedure to att ain the aimed treatment (Y. Y. Wang, Peng, & Stephenson, 2009) , 
and could influence microbial population dynamic of aerobic granular sludge during the continuous operation. Thus, 
applying appropriate proportion is important for the efficient performance of any BNR process (Khursheed et al., 
2018) . In an SBR treatment system, influent COD/N ration that can be calculated by Eq. ( 7) higher than 10 is 
recommended for effective nitrogen removal (C. Tan, Ma, & Qiu, 2013) . 
The influent C/N ratio  can be calculated by the equation;  
C/N ratio = COD/TN = c (COD )/c(TN)                 (7) 
where:  
 c(COD ) and c(TN) stand for influent COD  and TN concentrations (C. Tan et al., 2013) . 
Studies found that  elevated COD /N ratios resulted in poor granula tion as low COD/N ratios led to 
microorganism a ggregatio n in reactors.  Besides that, a fall in the COD/N ratio can cause an increase in the nitrification 
rate, rapid carbon deficit, granule destabilization and treatment downturn, major microbial community change, 
physical structure strength and settleability (H. Y. Wang et al., 2018) . High nitrogen or low ca rbon due to settling of 
suspended load at the initial stages can lead to low C/N ratio (Khursheed et al., 2018) . Consequentially, NH 4+-N 
elimination performance  decreases with a reduction  in C/N ratio (Jin et al., 2013) . In order to restrict the electron 
supplies for reductive half -reactions, the application of a low C/N ratio has been documented, resulting  to the growth 
of denitrification intermediates (NO 2−, NO and N 2O). It has certain degre e of inhibition on denitrifying bacteria (Jin et 
al., 2013) . However, in all C/N ratios tested, the utilization of surplus electron donors contributes to electron source 
wastefulness, increased MLSS, MLVSS and effluent COD. Decreasing C/N/P led t o a consistent improvement in the 
COD removal efficiency in  the SBR to 99.95%  (Chao et al., 2020) . In a related study, reduced COD/N ratios from 20 -
4 boosted bioactivity and maintained  settling, while reducing nitrogen removal as a result of carbon deficiency (H. 
Y. Wang et al., 2018) . 
 
3.15 Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)  
MLSS is  a highly complex and  the most important operational parameter for SBR systems because it significantly 
influences effl uent efficiency.  It is the composition of specified quantity of suspended solid s, combined with arriving 
wastewater. As a result, it should be checked on a regular basis . Sludge bulking occurs when the MLSS value is high, 
rendering the dye treatment system less efficient. In a dye containing wastewater, SBR system  efficacy  was improved 
to 75% by increasing MLSS values up to 2000 mg/L with 90 Turbidity and 75% COD removals (Ogleni et al., 2012) . 
Batch experiments sho wed there was great potential in applying high MLSS for dye degradation . These oppose the 
study in which effluent quality significantly drops under high MLSS concentrations (Alattabi, Harris, Alkhaddar, 
Ortoneda -Pedrola, & Alzeyadi, 2019) .  
 
3.16 Hydrodynamic shear forces  
Dye degradation in SBR system through aerobic granulation can be accomplished whenever fitting shear forces are 
employed. It has been judged that a specified hydrodynamic shear force value is essential for aerobic granules 
development, structure, stability  and metabolism. To effectively calculate the shear forces, hydrodynamic shear forces 
must be considered because of the friction among biomass and liquid exterior  (H. Y. Wang et al., 2018) . 
Thus, the shear force ( τ) can be calculated by the following equation  
𝜏=25 µ 𝐹 
𝐷P 𝑆R 1−𝜀
𝜀2+1.75 𝜌 𝐹2
𝑆R2 1
𝜀2                                                                                                                             (8) 
where;  
Effect of environmental and operational parameters on sequential batch reactor systems in dye degradation12 
 SR =  geometric section area (m2),   
Dp =  equivalent diameter (m) of filling particles,  
μ =  absolute fluid viscosity (kg/m s),  
ε =  bed porosity (m3empties/m3 bed),  
F = recirculation flow rate (m3/s) and  
ρ =  fluid density (kg/m3), 
Eq. ( 8) above explain s that shear forces  are depend ents on ε and Dp  
Biomass density and hydrophobicity increases as hydrodynamic shear forces increase. Higher hydraulic 
shearing force which is mainly affected by DO greatly contribute to aerobic granules rapid development  (Yan et al., 
2019) . This could be achieved if adequate oxygen is provided by restated and strong shear force to  mitigate filament 
growth for the system to remain stable in the course of long -term operations (H. Y. Wang  et al., 2018) . 
 
3.17  Electric Power  
A study by (Aygun, Nas, Berktay, & Ates, 2014)  reported the negative effects of power interruption as: poor TSS and 
COD removal efficiencies alongside poor sludge settling properties. It also concluded that the longer the interrup tion 
time, the greater recovery time required for system to attain steady -state. In a power related study, passing electric 
current density through a functional SBR system successfully removed  nitrogen and phosphorus compounds by 
autotrophic (hydrogenotrop hic) de nitrification and coagulation processes respectively  (Klodowska, Rodziewicz, & 
Janczukowicz, 2018) .  
 
 
4.  Optimization of SBR operational and environmental parameters by response surface methodology 
(RSM)  
RSM applies statistical and mathematic al modeling approaches  to estimate and optimize essential parameters 
that influence the behavior of a given response. It is an effective way to construct models, design experiments, consider 
the relationship between variables and deduce optimal working var iables . It is also used to assess SBR performance 
at various operational and environmental conditions , especially in dye containing wastewater treatment (Sathian et al., 
2014 ). It is commonly used to improve the treatment ability of synthetic dyes -contaminated wastewater.  As a 
successful technique, RSM also has the potential to model and optimize over four efficient factors, which could lead 
to more useful and informative performance. Among RSM's different design approaches, such as  Central Composite 
Design (CCD), Box -Behnken Design (BBD) , Full Factorial Design  and Doehlert Design (DD), CCD was perhaps the 
most popular . CCD joined with RSM overwhelms the constraints of seve ral classical approaches. Most researchers 
have studied ≤ 4 variables and pH, RT and C0 were the most common response variables in all procedures, with %R 
being the most common response.  
Currently, the most popular computer program for RSM are Minitab and  Design Expert. In recent studies, n o 
particular pattern has been noticed regarding the kind of dyes (Karimifard & Moghaddam, 2018) . The effects of SRT, 
dye concentration, and HRT were investigated using AnSBR on React ive Red 159 decolorization employing RSM 
via a central composite design following non -sterile and anaerobic conditions (Srisuwun et al., 2018) . The CCD was 
chosen because of its capacity to support a range of factors and provide a definite prediction. In the study, CCD was 
fitted applying the second -order polynomial quadratic equation (eqn (6)) with three independent factors including 
HRT, dye concent ration and SRT, while the decolorization was the response variable. Model expressions adoption or 
rejection was carried out on 95% percent confidence level probability (P) value. The findings were analyzed using 
variance analysis (ANOVA).

 To unveil the fitness of the selected model, the coefficient of determination ( R2) was being utilized . Fisher's F -
test was adopted to confirm the statistical significance of the  fitted model . Based on the consequences of the independent 
parameters, contours and 3D plots for the dependent factors were determined.  As response variables for mathematical 
models, dye effluent, decolorization, and rate of decolorization were utilized w ith dye concentration as a favored AnSBR 
shift factors . The laboratory  experiment was conducted  with 8 days HRT, 6,500 mg/L dyes and 20 days SRT  achieved 
97.68, 142.62 mg/L  and 264.54 mg/L/h for % decolorization, dye effluent  and rate of decolorization , respectively. The 
results also indicate that, there  was a high -grade balance between the decolorization efficiencies experimental and predicted 
values.   
Unlike the earlier discussed scenario, all experiments were conducted in SBR mode at 5day HRT utilizin g Box -
Behnken design (BBD) as COD, SVI and decolorization, were evaluated for individual  operational  state. The impact of 
process variables such as cycle time, air flow rate, and SRT was examined by the authors with findings evaluated  by 
ANOVA  utilizing  the quadratic regression model. For COD, SVI and decolorization, model P values were quite low, 
reaffirming the significance of the model . The predicted R2 value agrees  with the adjusted R2 values for the three responses.  
SBR performance was investigated at various OLRs under optimal provisions , and the outcomes showed that OLR of 
0.165 KgCOD/m3d achieved COD reduction and highest decolorization of 79.4%  and 71.3% , respectively . The SVI was 
found to be low indicating the high SBR effectiveness. To further explain the optimization studies, Fig. 1 a illustrates 
decolorization as a function of SRT and air flow rate, confirming that decolorization often rises as the air  flow rate rises . 
However, air  flow rate > 15.9 LPH decreases decolorization . Fig. 1b demonstrated that a rise in SRT value resulted in a 
rise in decolorization percentage while decolorization was not affected significantly by increasing the cycle duration.   
For COD reduction, similar profiles were received as depicted  in Figs. 2a and 2b. As can be observed in Fig. 3a 
and 3b, a rise in SRT led to a reduction in the SVI value . However, at elevated SRT, the SVI value rises . This could be 
due to sludge disintegration at higher airflow rate . As shown in Fig. 3b, c ycle duration  had no negative  impact  on the SVI 
value.  From this study, it can be inferred that RSM could be effectively used for dye wastewater treatment in SBR (Sathian 
et al., 2014) . 6

5. Conclusion  
To break off the health, aesthetic, and environmental issues emanating from the incessant discharge of 
contaminated dye wastewater into the environment, treatment of dye contaminated wastewat er has become a big 
environmental problem. Therefore, developing an efficient wastewater treatment technique in terms of managing limited 
water supplies and as well the need for environmental conservation becomes paramount . Numerous  strategies have been 
tried for dye degradation , showing different  levels  of effectiveness and weaknesses as discussed in the chapter. In recent 
times, the usage of SBR in dye containing wastewater treatment, has continuously receive d attention from scholars  because 
it is an efficient process for wastewater treatment, taking advantage of the high SBR versatility.  This chapter included a 
thorough evaluation of current research papers, emphasizing on the usability and efficacy of the SBR system for dye 
treatmen t. The chapter went on to look at the impact of environmental and operational variables on the SBR system  and 
arrived at the following conclusions.   
 For effective use of SBR while treating dye wastewater, special attention must be given to the choice of the 
appropriate environmental and operational parameters . These control parameters can be appropriately changed 
and the decolorization potential be recovered . 
 These optimization strategies for environmental/operational parameters thus, setting the stage fo r SBR to become 
a successful, long -term, and inexpensive technology with fewer by -products  
 The application of RSM to physicochemical dye removal processes could result in great design and optimization. 
Researchers focused on dye degradation, physicochemica l processes, and RSM would find this article extremely 
helpful.  
 Due to the higher elimination of dangerous intermediate metabolites found in dyes, it is better for the environment 
to combine sequencing batch reactor system with other treatment technologies that are efficient for dye 
degradation instead of the conventional SBR process alone
