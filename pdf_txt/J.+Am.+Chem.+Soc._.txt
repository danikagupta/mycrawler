Table S2 shows the measured concentration depe ndent pH values for the ferric chloride and 
ferric nitrate solutions. pH values are the result of averaging three independently prepared 
solutions and were not observed  to change over a 24hr period. 
   S3 1. Collection of Experimental Polarized Raman Spectra 
 
Vertically polarized excitation light (532 nm) is first scattered off the sample. The vertically 
polarized and horizontally polarized (90° from incident polarization) is collected in a 180° 
geometry from the initial excitation orientation. Sample spectra are subtracted from the spectra of the empty sample compartment. 
 
 
Figure S1 : Excitation and collection light positioned in a 180° experimental geometry. 
Excitation light is polariz ed vertically (V) and the polarization of  the scattered light is collected 
in both horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarizations. 
 
Due to both the geometry and polarization of th e excitation and collected light, the observed 
spectra are proportional to:
1 
 H32  (1) 
 V45242  (2) 
where α2 (isotropic) and β2 (anisotropic) are the invariants of the Raman polarizability tensor. This 
leads to the calculation for the purely isotropic and anisotropic spectra by: 
 IisoV4/3 H452  (3) 
  Ianiso(4 / 3) H42   (4) 
 
 
 
  
 S4 2. Calculation of the Perturbed Water Spectrum  
 
The perturbed water spectrum ( PWS ) is calculated as a bilinear decomposition of the data 
matrix D (where column 1 = the pure solvent spectrum, and column 2 = the solute + solvent 
spectrum) into the pure re sponse spectral matrix ST (where column 1 = the pure solvent spectrum, 
and column 2 = the pure solute spectrum) due to perturbation by a change in concentration C 
matrix. 
 DCSTE  (5) 
E is the matrix of residuals not explained by the linear model. MCR-ALS  iteratively solves Eq. 5 
by alternating least squares method calculating C and ST while fitting to D using the initial 
estimates for C. 
 
The MCR-ALS  algorithm has 2 principle constraints: 
1. Spectral non-negativity (using a Fa st Non-negativity Least Squares ( FNNLS ) algorithm) 
2. Closure: The sum across the row of  the concentration matrix = 1. 
 For more details on the mathematics of the alternating least squares method and FNNLS  algorithm 
please see references

Table S3 adopts the formalism described by Stumm and Morgan21 and shows the thermodynamic 
formation constants for the ferric  hydrolysis, and complexed chlo ro- and nitrate species as an 
average obtained from the literature. The relativ e abundance of each ferric species is calculated 
using ChemEQL22 using the measured pH for each conc entration (Table S2) and equilibrium 
constants from Table S3.
