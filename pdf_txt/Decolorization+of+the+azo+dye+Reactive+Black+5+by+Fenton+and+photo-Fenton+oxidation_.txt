abstract
In this study, optimum conditions of color removal from aqueous solution of anionic Reactive Black 
5 (RB5) dye through the Fenton oxidation process were investigated. Central composite design 
(CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the Fenton process. The pH, 
dye concentration, Fe2+ dosage and H2O2 dosage were selected as independent variables of method, 
and design experiments were carried out. Intervals of independent variables were initial pH of 
solution pH (2.5–5.5), dye concentration (50–350 mg/L), Fe2+ dosage (25–55 mg/L) and H2O2 dos-
age (175–425 mg/L) at a constant temperature of 30°C. The color removal performance of Fenton reactive increased with decreasing pH value and dye concentration and increasing reactive amount. 
The experimental studies showed that the RB5 removal efficiency of Fenton oxidation was over 99%. The conditions of maximum removal were obtained as initial solution pH 2.5, dye concentration 
120 mg/L, Fe
2+ dosage 25 mg/L and H2O2 dosage 240 mg/L. A full quadratic model equation which 
interacts response variables with independent variables was developed. The model data agreed with experimental data very well. R
2 value confirming the reliability of the model equation was 96.19%.

1. Introduction
In the world, 700,000 metric tons of synthetic dyes with 
more than 100,000 kinds used in different industries (such as 
textiles, paper, leather, cosmetics, plastic, etc) are produced every year. Textile products are used in various fields in our daily life. Because of the differences in production pro-cesses, dyed wastewaters are produced in large quantities and contain different pollutants [1].
The dyeing materials are used for textile dyeing for 
more than 4,000 years [2]. The volume of dyestuffs dis-
charged to receiving media is very high and poses a threat to the environment. It affects aesthetically the environment, obstructs the light and oxygen input to the aquatic atmo-sphere and causes negative results on the ecosystem [3]. Dyestuffs have a synthetic origin and contain complex aro-matic structures. Due to toxicity content, the living things in the receiving environment are adversely affected [4]. Color removal from wastewaters is difficult because of the low biodegradability of dye materials [5].
Dyes, especially acidic and reactive dyes, cannot be 
treated with conventional methods due to its resistive struc-tures to degradation like microbial, chemical and photolytic [6]. In the cotton and synthetic textile sectors, 50%–75% of total dye consumption comes from reactive dyes which are biologically difficult to degrade [7]. For this reason, color removal in wastewater requires the use of mechanical, chemical and advanced treatment techniques instead of con-ventional treatment methods such as biological treatment, adsorption and coagulation [8]. Most of traditional studies 107 Y. Süzen, C. Ozmetin / Desalination and Water Treatment 172 (2019) 106–114
such as chemical precipitation [9], adsorption using cheaper 
natural clays like montmorillonite [10], illite [11], clinoptilo-
lite [12] and various bio sorbents (fly ash, corn stalk, walnut 
shells, rice husks, and cotton wastes) [13] are focused on the 
color removal.
The advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) comprise the 
generation of hydroxyl radical (OH•) which is a reactive 
intermediate and has high oxidation potential. The pur -
pose of oxidation is to convert the chromophoric groups into colorless and reduced intermediates to forms suitable for biological oxidation. Components such as chlorine, chlo-rine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide and ozone can be used as oxidative reactivity [14].
AOPs are extensively applied to oxidize several classes of 
pollutants, including different dyes and characters [15–19]. Also AOPs like; electrocoagulation [20], photocatalytic oxidation [21], ozonation [22,23], and Fenton’s oxidation [7,24–26], UV/H
2O2 [27], TiO2/UV [28] and ultrasound [29] 
have been attempted to decolorize and detoxify of textile 
wastewaters and different dyes. AOPs might be a good alter -
native for traditional treatment methods. Fenton oxidation, 
one of the oldest AOPs, is a mixture of iron salt and hydrogen peroxide-based on the formation of hydroxyl radicals at acidic pH and this process is defined as an iron-catalyzed H
2O2 decomposition reaction [7]. Fenton peroxidation mech-
anism of an organic compound is formed by a few steps such as the formation of the OH
• radical and its oxidative 
reaction with organic compounds [30].
Recently, traditional methods are replaced by statistical 
experiment design methods because of the decrease in many experiments and time and cost-saving [31]. Response sur -
face methodology (RSM) is a statistical technique that can be used to the model of various systems, to evaluate simultane-ous and separately effects of different factors. It provides a model equation that gives the most appropriate conditions for the desired conditions. This mathematical model can be used to predict the response of a process for any new and dif-ferent conditions [32]. In industrial applications, the process conditions that provide the discharge color values of waste-water can be determined by RSM. Under these conditions, it is possible to reduce the operating cost because of the pH set-ting and the less chemical consumption for reagent dosing.
In this study, the treatability of Reactive Black 5 (RB5) dye 
synthetic solutions by Fenton advanced oxidation process was investigated. The optimization of experimental conditions for removal of RB5 dye was carried out using the central com-posite design (CCD) technique under RSM with Minitab 16.0 program. The experiments of Fenton oxidation were designed by CCD to match a model to the least-squares method [33].
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
RB5 dye purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The chemical 
properties of dye are given in Table 1 and the chemical struc-
ture of dye is given in Fig. 1. H
2O2 35% (w/w) and FeSO4·7H2O 
supplied from Merck were used to prepare stock reactant solutions. The other chemical reagents supplied from Merck were of analytical grade and distilled water was used to prepare solutions. 2.2. Experimental method
Experimental studies have been carried out on syn-
thetic dye solutions. RB5 dye was selected because of the common use in the textile industry. Fenton oxidation exper -
iments were performed in a 1 L volume jacketed reactor. Temperature was controlled with a thermometer and set to 30°C. 100 g/L stock H
2O2 and 20 g/L stock FeSO4·7H2O 
solutions were used at specified dosages. Fenton oxidation was performed in four stages: pH adjustment to acidic val-ues, oxidation reaction, neutralization and coagulation [6]. The experimental procedure was applied as follows; pH adjustments in appropriate range for the Fenton process (2 < pH < 5) were carried out by using 1 M H
2SO4 aqueous 
solution, and then Fenton oxidation reactant solutions were added in dye solutions and rapid and slow mixing were immediately carried out at 120 rpm for 2 min and 30 rpm for 20 min, respectively. The samples were settled for 30 min afterward. The pH of the supernatant sample was adjusted to 7.5 using 1 M NaOH to remove Fe
2+ salts and left to settle 
for 90 min. [9]. The sample from the upper phase was cen-trifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min and the color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) values remaining were measured by the spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the samples was analyzed with an SQ Pharo 300 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 597 nm, which is the maximum absorp-
tion wavelength of RB5. COD was determined according to the standard closed reflux and colorimetric method [34]. RSM analysis was used to evaluate the data and develop a regression model effectively. Also, Microtox [35] toxicity

2.3. Design method
As a design method, RSM identifies the relationship 
between the controllable input parameters and the response 
variable [32]. Using RSM analyses the experimental results by the procedure to fit the following second-order polyno-mial model as shown in Eq. (3).
y = β0 + β1 x
1 + β2x2 + β3x3 + β4x4 + β11x12 + β22x22 + β33x32 + 
β44x42 + β12x1x2 + β13x1x3 + β14x1x4 + β23x2x3 + β24x2x4 (3)
where the estimated dependent variable (y), the regression 
coefficients (β) resulting from the correlation of the affecting factors: the constant of the regression equation (β0), linear coefficients (β1, β2, β3, β4), interaction coefficients (β12, β13, β23, β24, β14), quadratic coefficients (β11, β22, β33, β44) and x
1, x2, x3, x4 are the independent variables that studied [33].
CCD consists of factorial or fractional factorial design 
with center points, augmented with a group of axial points that allow estimation of curvature. CCD can be used for effi-ciently estimation of first and second-order terms and can develop a model response with curvature by adding center and axial points to a previously run factorial design [36].Repeated analysis for center points in the analysis is used to check for deviation of fitness. The (±α) is the axial points that are out of the surface of the cube graph, (0) points represent cube center and (±1) points represent the surface of the cube plots.
CCD, the most widely used approach of RSM, was 
employed to optimize the four independent variables which are initial pH, dye concentration, Fe
2+ dosage and H2O2 dos-
age in our study. The four factors with five different levels were determined as independent variables in the design and its two levels were out of experimental factor space. The color removal in percent was taken as a response vari-able. The levels and ranges of independent variables are shown in Table 2.
3. Results
The experiments were performed at the conditions deter -
mined by RSM, experimental and model results are shown 
in Table 3. Following the experimental design presented in Table 3, an empirical full quadratic model equation, in terms 
of the four independent variables, as shown in Eq. (4) was 
developed for color removal (%). The model was confirmed 
by the high R
2 and fitted well to the experimental data.  The correlation coefficients of the model equation were 
defined as R-Sq. = 0.9619 and R-Sq. (adj) = 0.9263.
The experimental data for color removal were analyzed 
statistically by analysis of variance and the results are sub-
mitted in Table 4. According to Table 4, the quadratic and 
interaction regression models have a very low probability value in Fisher’s F -test (Prob > F  = 0.0001). Therefore, it is 
clear that the models are quite significant [30].
Belong to Eqs. (4) the significance of each coefficient was 
determined by applying the t -test. Also, p-values of each 
term determined according to the t -test are listed in Table 5. 
The p values of coefficient p  < 0.05, it means that these are 
significant. The model Y
1 terms X12, X42, X1X3, and X1X4 had 
significant effects on the percentage of color removal since each p-value was less than 0.05 as seen Table 5.
The model constants given in Table 5 are used to develop 
the general regression model. The model can help us to find removal efficiency without testing for any conditions in the design range.

Fig. 2 shows that there is a linear relationship between 
the experimental data and predicted values. After developed 
the model equation, eight new experiments that involve the same factors were planned to check the validity and applica-bility of the obtained model equation. As seen in Fig. 3, the 
experimental data and predicted data for these new experi-
ments were compatible with each others.
It has been noted that these factors should be chosen dif-
ferently at the determined level limits to represent the system 
well. The generated experiments are given in Table 6.
Model validation control experiments have shown that 
required results can be achieved without experimenta-
tion under the desired conditions using this model. High removal efficiencies were obtained with Fenton oxidation. 
In addition to decolorization, changes in COD were inves-
tigated for eight experiments. Also, the Fenton process was 
found to be effective in the removal of COD.
Maximum COD removal efficiency was obtained for 
lower dye concentration. As the used dosage ratios are 
increased, the efficiency of COD removal increases. COD 
removal by oxidation with Fenton process is not as effective 
as color removal. Therefore COD removal efficiencies range 
from 33% to 97% as seen in Fig. 4.Table 2

3.1. Effect of Fe2+ concentration
As seen in Fig. 5, the color removal performance increases 
with increasing Fe2+ ion concentration in sufficient H2O2 
concentration. The removal performance decreases even in the presence of high dosages of iron if the sufficient H2O2 
is not available in the solution.
In case of the sufficient iron ion concentration, radicals 
are formed from hydrogen peroxide with high oxidation 
potential [3].Table 5

3.2. Effect of H2O2 concentration
As seen in Fig. 6, the percentage of decomposition of 
pollutants generally increases with increasing hydrogen 
peroxide concentration which alone does not lead to the gen-
eration of hydroxyl radicals. Increased removal efficiency can be explained by an increase in the hydroxide radicals with high oxidation potential. The adjustment of the oxidant 
dosage is also important in terms of operating costs [1].
3.3. Effect of pH
It is seen from Fig. 7 that decreasing initial pH values 
affect the removal performance positive. This is because, at 
pH values lower than 3.5, ferrous ions are more stable for resulting in a better redox system and effective decoloriza -
tion ratio. The formation of ferric ions, which tend to pro-duce ferric hydroxo complexes, increases with rising pH. Also, H
2O2 is unstable and easily decomposes itself in alkali 
solutions [6]. The reaction rate slows down due to the reduc-tion of soluble iron ion types at the high alkaline pH values. If the pH is too alkaline; hydrogen peroxide is catalytically degraded and the activity in the solution decreases [17].

3.4. Effect of dye concentration
It can be seen from Fig. 8 that increasing dye concen-
tration reduces the removal efficiency for constant oxidant 
concentration. The amount of reagent required for the treat-
ment increases with increasing pollutant concentration [15].
As a result of the optimization performed, the conditions 
that give the maximum color removal efficiency are shown in Table 8. A verification experiment was conducted for 
conditions determined and the color removal efficiency was 
obtained as above 99%.
4. Conclusions
A laboratory batch study of the Fenton oxidation tech-
nique for the decolorization of synthetic RB5 solution was 
investigated. The effects of the discrete experiments on the color removal efficiencies were observed using an RSM and the experimental conditions were optimized.
The RSM results showed the different effects of four 
operating variables consisting of dye concentration, initial pH, Fe
2+ and H2O2 dosages as well as their interactive and 
quadratic effects on color removal by Fenton. The operational conditions of the Fenton oxidation process compare properly with previously obtained decolorization data. The ratio of Fe
2+/H2O2 ions determined as optimum 1/10 according to the 
5–25-fold ratio in the literature [7]. Initial pH and dye con-
centration exhibited a negative effect, while the dosage of 
H2O2 and dosage of Fe2+ had a positive effect on color removal 
efficiency. A verification experiment was conducted for the conditions where the maximum removal was found in the optimization result. It was determined that the color removal efficiency is 99% as a result of the verification experiment performed. This study shows that the combined effect of selected variables on the Fenton oxidation of synthetic dye solutions by using RSM can be predicted close to real results.9095

Table 9 shows some examples of different wastewater 
treatments with various AOPs. RB5 has been used frequently 
in synthetic solutions to characterize textile wastewater in the literature. However, RB5 treatment with AOPs has been reported in the literature. Even so, there are not enough stud-ies about optimization and model validation of treatment with RSM. This study is thought to contribute to this part of the literature.
When the studies are examined, it is seen that AOPs are 
effective in color [19] and toxicity [37] removal from synthetic or real wastewater containing dyes.
The accuracy of the proposed analysis of variance full 
quadratic model is acceptable, resulting in a high R
2 value of 
96.19% achieved in color removal. According to our results, it is seen that the parameters which are effective in the removal of RB5 dye by Fenton oxidation can be determined by CCD. It is determined that the Fenton process is an alter -
native method that can be used in the treatment of wastewa-ter containing dyes (such as the textile industry) because it provides removal of color as well as COD removal.
