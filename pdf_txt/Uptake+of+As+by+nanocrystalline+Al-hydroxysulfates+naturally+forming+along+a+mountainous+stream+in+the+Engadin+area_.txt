Although the chemical composition is quite similar, their crystalline varieties significantly differ, demonstrating that various types of precipitates can form under very similar conditions and that their respective formation is not fully understood yet. Here we report the occurrence of large amounts of nanocrystalline Al-hydroxysulfates that form naturally in a small alpine catchment in the Engadin area where an acidic mountainous stream (pH∼4) is neutralized successively after mixing with several neutral tributaries (Fig. 1). Synchrotron-based high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXD) and subsequent pair distribution function (PDF) analyses demonstrate that these precipitates are structurally the same as basaluminite samples obtained from acid mine drainage sites (Wanner et al., 2018). In contrast, only minor amounts of tetrahedrally coordinated Al, as present in Al13, were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We hypothesize that in our field system, high sulfate and fluoride concentrations on the order of 1-2 and 100 mg/L, respectively, as well as low water temperatures (<8°C) favor the formation of basaluminite instead of Al13-bearing sulfate precipitates. Interestingly, the basaluminite precipitates are characterized by elevated As concentrations up to 600 µg/g, whereas other heavy metals are at background concentrations only. Given the low As concentrations in the stream from which precipitation occurs (<0.03 mg/L), high As concentrations confirm that basaluminite serves as a highly efficient As sink. We conclude that the high affinity for As results from the high sorption capacity of basaluminite and hence from the uptake of arsenate anions under the prevailing oxidizing conditions. 16th Swiss Geoscience Meeting, Bern 2018
