 1The decolorization of industrial dyes was investigated us ing extracellular 
enzymes produced by 21 basidiomycetes, mainly edible mushrooms. Among the 
27 dyes used in this study, nine were decolorized by over 40%. Most fungi 
decolorized Acid Orange 20, but they showed  different specificities in the case of 
the other dyes. Determination of activity staining by native polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis revealed that all the d ecolorization activities corresponded to 
ABTS oxidation activities. 
 2Industrial dyes are re leased into the environment as wastewater by industries. The 
colored water evokes an unpleas ant feeling even if it is  only slightly visible. 
Moreover, some of them are stable agains t light, temperature and biodegradation, and 
have accumulated in the environment as recalcitrant compounds. Bioremediation may 
be the most effective method of treating such contaminants. However, dyes within 
wastewater are poorly decolorized by aerobi c biotreatments (1, 2), and thus, useful 
microbes or enzymes that are readily availa ble for conventional processing should be 
developed. 
White-rot fungi are a class of microorganisms that produce efficient enzymes 
capable of decomposing dyes under aer obic conditions. They produce various 
oxidoreductases that degrade lignin and re lated aromatic compounds. They are also 
expected to be used for the degradation of many pollutants such as dioxins (3), PCB 
(4), and other recalcitrant or toxic substan ces (5, 6). Particular ly, the decolorization 
of azo dyes has been mainly studied (7, 8). In the study of phenol oxidoreductases, 
industrial dyes are expected to be an available substrat e because most of them are 
aromatic compounds with various substitution groups, and many types with a structural resemblance are available on the market. Moreover, the ability of enzyme 
to degrade such dyes can be easily determ ined by measuring the dye decolorization. 
However, there are few studies on the possi bility of dye decomposition except for the 
monoazo group. In addition, microorganisms involved in degradation have been limited to certain fungi. In this study, the decolorization ability of 27 types of dye 
was investigated using the extracellular enzymes produced by 21 basidiomycetes. Furthermore, the substrate specificity a nd the relationship of the enzymes to the 
ligninolytic enzymes were determined. 
Table 1 shows the 27 dyes used in th is study and their abbreviations. The 
basidiomycetes shown in Table 2 were inoc ulated into 15 g of wheat bran with 64% 
moisture in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask. The culture was carried out at 20°C for 30 d. 
Extracellular enzymes were pr epared at 4°C by stirring the medium at 120 rpm with 
50 ml of 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) in the flask. After 10 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min and the supernatant was 
used for the experiment. 
←Table 1 and 2 
The decolorization activitie s of the enzymes produced by the 21 basidiomycetes 
were investigated using 27 types of dye at pHs 3.0, 5.0 and 7.0. These were 
determined by measuring the absorbance of the dye at λmax (λmax at pH 5.0 is 
indicated in Table 1). After the incubation of the reaction mixture for 24 h at 30°C in 
the dark, the percentage decrease in absorbance was determined using a microplate reader (Sunrise Rainbow Thermo; Tecan, Lausanne, Switzerland). Among the 27 dyes, only nine shown in Table 3 were d ecolorized by more th an 40% by any fungus. 
The decolorization might have been caused by enzyme action because the decolorization was not shown using a heat -denatured extract. Among all the dyes, 
AO20 was strongly decolorized by most fungi at approximately pH 3.0 to 5.0. 
However, various specificities were ob served in the case of the other dyes. Lentinus 
edodes showed high activity against all dyes listed in Table 3. Agaricus bisporus , 
Armillariella mellea , Lampteromyces japonicus, Panellus serotinus and Pleurotus 
ostreatus  decolorized both phthalocyanine a nd triphenylmethane dyes by more than 
70%. Pleurotus salmoneostramineus  was most effective for the two phthalocyanine 
dyes, and the decolorization reached more  than 90% (DB86 and PB). The optimum 
 3pHs for the decolorization of thes e dyes were also around 3.0 to 5.0. 
To investigate the relationship betwee n the decolorization and the ligninolytic 
enzyme activities, the six fungi that had di fferent decolorization activities were used 
for the following experiment. Lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase 
(MnP) activities were assayed according to a previous report (9). The ABTS oxidation activity (10) was assayed as an index of laccase (Lcc) and other 
oxidoreductases. All fungi showed ABTS oxi dation activity but not other ligninolytic 
enzyme activities. The ABTS activities were 53 ( A. bisporus ), 5.0 ( L. japonicus ), 19 
(L. edodes), 0.83 ( P . serotinus ), 6.2 ( P . ostreatus ) and 1.9 ( P . salmoneostramineus ) 
U/ml. The low MnP activity (0.26 U/ml) was found only in the case of P . ostreatus.  
Particularly, A. bisporus  and L. edodes showed high activity against ABTS. However, 
these did not correlate with the dye decolorization activity at all. These facts suggest that the decolorization might be caused by Lcc or other types of oxidoreductase with different substrate specificities. Among th ese fungi, the characteristics or the gene 
sequences of some Lcc produced by A. bisporus  (11, 12), L. edodes  (13) and P.  
ostreatus  (14) have been reported. Particularly, Lcc 1 from L. edodes  was reported to 
be effective in some dyes without the need  for mediators (15). Some Lcc isozymes 
also show different specificities ag ainst various phenolic compounds (16). 
The determination of activity staining by native polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis was performed using the four dyes that decolo rized well (Fig.1). 
These dyes, namely AO20, DB1, DB 86 and BG1, are monoazo, diazo, 
phthalocyanine and triphenylmethane dyes, respectively. After electrophoresis under alkaline native conditions, the gel wa s incubated for 15 min in 20 mM sodium 
acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 2 mM  ABTS, 25 mM AO20, 0.6 mM DB1, 25 mM 
DB86 or 10 mM BG1. In the case of the dyes,  the gel was then transferred to the 
same buffer lacking the dye and incubate d until the band appeared. When ABTS was 
used as a substrate, one or more activity ba nds were observed in most fungi. Some of 
the activity bands showed diffused or heterogeneous bands with different mobilities. These might be some isoforms with different glycosylation or modifications such as by proteolysis. When dye was used as a s ubstrate, decolorized and discolored bands 
were observed, the latter also being decolo rized after further incubation. All activity 
bands corresponded completely to that of ABTS oxidation. For all the fungi used, the 
activity bands were divided into two groups  according to their specificity. The first 
included bands B, E, F, G, J, K and L, wh ich showed a wide specificity against most 
dyes used in Fig. 1. Exceptionally, bands J and L had no abilit y to decolorize BG1. 
The second group, including bands A, C, D,  H, I and M, was almost specific for 
some dyes. Among these, all bands except fo r C showed the ability to decolorize 
AO20 alone. A pair of these groups was present in all the fungi except for L. edodes, 
which abundantly showed a single decolori zation activity. It seem ed that the F band 
showed higher activity against ABTS than th e other dyes. In contrast, bands J and L 
decolorized the dyes well despite the low ABTS activity. In the assay by absorbance 
measurement, all the fungi decolorize d all the dyes (data not shown). The 
decolorization developed proporti onally with incubation time. ←Fig. 1 
The chemical structure of the dyes affected the decolorization. AO7 was 
negligibly decolorized and the decolorization percentage was less than 20% for all fungi. Its structure is very similar to that of AO20, but the hydroxyl group in the naphthalene ring binds to  a different site ( o-position). A similar result was also 
 4observed in the case of diazo dyes. DB 1 and DB15 contain the same methoxyl 
groups but the positions of the sulfo groups  are different. DB6 also has the same 
structure as DB15 except for the absen ce of methoxyl groups. Among these dyes, 
only DB1 was decolorized well. In the case of triphenylmethane dyes, the length of 
the alkyl side chain might affect th e decolorization. BG1, which contains 
diethylamino groups, showed more decolorization than BB1 and BV3 which contain 
dimethylamino groups. These structures might be similar to that of phenylpropanoid, a major component of lignin. To investigate the structure essentia l for decolorization, 
further studies using more types of dye would be necessary. The information that we obtained might be applicable to the de sign of various biodegradable compounds. 
In this experiment, some effective en zymes for decolorization were selected. 
These are expected to be used not only for dye decolorization but also for the removal of other contaminants. The addition of a mediator also extends the reactivity 
widely, and allows for the decompos ition of various substances (17).
