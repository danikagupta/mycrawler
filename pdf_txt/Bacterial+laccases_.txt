ABSTRACT: Laccases, a type of copper oxidase belongs to the family of 1,4 -benzenediol. Laccase, a 
glycoprotein, is found ubiquitously in various organisms ranging from fungi to larger plants. Ov er the last 
several decades, there has been an amazing in crease in the application and consumption of bacterial 
laccases across a variety of sectors. Bacterial laccases offer several distinct advantages over fungal laccases 
from an industrial perspective. They have a variety of temperatures and pH tolerance rang es while staying 
extremely stable  even in  the presence of many hazardous chemicals. Laccases' cellular position in bacteria 
varies by species; most naturally produced laccases in bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis  as well as 
Sinorhizobium meliloti , occu r intracellularly, whereas a few, such as laccases from certain bacilli and 
actinomycetes, exist extracellularly. Laccase has evolved into an important commercially essential enzyme 
with a wide range  of applications, including lignocellulosic material deli gnification, biomedical and 
pharmaceutical applications, waste detoxification, and textile dye decolorization. Bacterial laccases present 
several challenges, including the diversity of laccases, lack  of standardization in characterization methods, 
difficul ties in strain identification and isolation, optimization of production, and protein engineering. 
Scaling up for industrial applications, substrate specificity, stability, and regulatory consideratio ns are also 
hurdles. The current study gives an in -depth look at laccase -producing bacteria, encompassing detailed 
information on enzyme properties, gene characterization, cloning techniques, and industrial applications.

INTRODUCTION  
Laccases, a type of copper oxidase belongs to the 
family of 1,4 -benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductases that 
are present in microorganisms, larger plants, bacteria, 
and insects (Shraddha et al ., 2011) . Each molecule of 
these glycosylation polyphenol oxidases contains a 
4Cu2+ ion which is responsible for the oxidative 
degrad ation of phenolic substances and non -phenolic 
substances,  including aromatic amines, diphenols, 
aliphatic amines, and loss of electrons (Gianfreda et al., 
2010; Rodríguez Couto & Toca Herrera 2006) . Free 
electrons such as these contribute to  the oxidative 
degradation of numerou s aromatic and non -aromatic 
molecules having phenolic rin gs replaced with different 
functional chains, including methoxy, amino, diamino, 
and hydroxyindols. Furthermore, laccases may oxidize 
multiple additional complexes of metals such as 
 [Fe(CN) 6]4, and [Os(CN) 6]4 including [Mo(CN) 8]4 
(Chandra & Chowdhary  2015a; Rezaei et al., 2017) . 
Laccase, a glycoprotein, is present in a wide range of 
species, from fungus to larger plants. Because of its 
high potential for redox reactions, it is mostly 
synthesized by white rot fung us and is widely used in 
industry. However, the commercia l application of 
fungal laccase frequently faces obstacles by its long fermentation period, low production yield, and limited 
effectiveness primarily under acidic or mesophilic 
conditions. This poses  a challenge as many industrial 
processes occur in harsh environments characterized by 
high temperatures, extreme pH levels, and elevated salt 
concentrations, where fungal laccase exhibits reduced 
activity (Du et al., 2015; Wang & Zhao 2008) . 
The consumption and application of bacterial laccase  in 
numerous sectors have  increased rapidly in the past few 
decades. Bacterial laccases offer several distinct 
advantages over funga l laccases from an industrial 
perspective. They have a variety of temperatures and 
pH tolerance range while staying extremely stable  even 
in the presence of many hazardous chemicals (Guan et 
al., 2015) . Furthermore, bacterial laccases are 
economically advantageous for industrial use due to 
their broad substrate specificity, rapid enzyme 
production, and efficient expre ssion with the help of 
cloning in host organisms under relevant contro l (Prins 
et al ., 2015) . These features make bacterial laccases 
highly valuable in diverse applications include paper 
and pulp bio -bleachi ng, in textile dye as decolorising 
agent, (Mathews et al. , 2016)  even in research of 
biosensors.

 Singh    et al.,               Biological Forum – An International Journal      15(9): 1046 -1051 (2023)                                         1047  Vario us laccase  produced by bacteria have been 
identified, expressed in appropriate host species, and 
chemically investigated extensively. This includes 
laccases derived from various bacterial species, which 
have been investigated for their enzyme properties, 
gene data, cloning methods, and practical applications 
(Chandra  & Chowdhary  2015b ; Narayanan et al. , 2015; 
Sharma et al., n.d.; G. Singh et al., 2011) . The current 
study gives a complete look at laccase -producing 
bacteria, encompassing detailed information on enzyme 
properties, gene characterization, cloning techniqu es, 
and industrial applications.  
Occurrence of Bacterial Laccase : Bacterial laccases, 
although less common and less extensively studied than 
fungal laccases, have been reported in certain bacterial 
species. They are present in either in Gram -positive or in Gram -negative bacteria that live in water as well as 
in soil. Bacteria, that produce laccase are found in the 
phyla Gemma Proteobacteria, Alpha, Firmicutes, 
Aquificae, Deinococcus, Cyanobacteria, Thermus, 
include a few Archaea members (Janusz et al ., 2020) . 
Laccases' cellular site in bacteria can differ by species; 
most natively showed laccases in ba cteria, like those 
from Sinorhizobium meliloti  and Bacillus subtilis  (S. 
Singh et al., 2021)  occur inside the cell, whereas a few 
occur outside the cell, with the value as laccases present 
in certain actino mycetes  and bacteria (Dubé et al. , 
2008) . Because the laccase process creates toxic 
chemicals, inside of cells bacterial laccases have ways 
to deal with the toxicity. (Janusz et al ., 2020) . For 
example, laccase production has b een observed in B. 
subtilis  and Bacillus licheniformis (Janusz et al., 2020) .  
 
Some strains o f Pseudomonas aeruginosa , including 
Pseudomonas putida  and Pseudomonas fluorescens , 
have also been found to produce laccase enzymes 
(Unuofin et al. , 2019) . In addition, certain  species of 
Streptomyces, such as Streptomyces cyaneus  and 
Streptomyces ipomoeae , have demonstrated laccase 
activity (Lisov et al., 2019; Suryadi et al ., 2022) . 
Furthermore, Thermus thermophilus , a thermophilic 
bacterium, has been reported to produce a heat -stable 
laccase (Adekunle et al. , 2017) . Although these studies 
highlight the presence of bacterial laccases, it's 
important to note that the occurrence and diversity of 
bacterial laccases are still areas of ongoing research.  
Industrial production of Bacterial Laccase: Laccase 
scaling up gives more realistic information  on energy 
and material consumption, allowing for an entire cost 
assessment of those products. Batch fermentation took 
place in a 10 -L bench -top bioreactor with a working 
capacity of 4 L, which was outfitted using three 6 -
bladed disc -turbine impellers & fo ur baffles and was 
connected to a digital control device. The 
fermenter  vessel containing the in statistical terms 
analyzed  medium was autoclaved for 20 minutes at 121 °C, while the CuSO 45H 2O and MnSO 4H2O solutions 
were sterilized  separately and then added  aseptically to 
the bioreactor, as well as sucrose with  vanillin acid 
solutions were sterilized  separately by syringe filter. 
After that, the bioreactor was injected with prepared 
inoculum. The temperature, agitation acceleration, 
airflow rate, and beginni ng pH included every one set 
to 30°C, 200 RPM, 1.0 VVM, and 7.0, respectively. To 
prevent foam growth, antifoam agent needs to  be added 
at a ratio of 1:100 (v/v) in distilled water at the start of 
the operation. Fermentation takes place under 
unregulated c ircumstances. To determine biomass, 
amount of protein, total carbohydrates intake, and 
laccase synthesis, samples must be taken at regular 
intervals (Abdelgalil et al., 2022) . 
Applications of Bacterial Lacc ase: Laccase has grown 
into a significant industrially useful enzyme with a 
broad spectrum of applications, including 
lignocellulosic material delignification, biomedical and 
pharmaceutical applications, bioremediation 
applications such as trash detoxing, & fabric dye 
decolorization.  The majority of significant industrial 
applications are described as.

pharmaceutical industry : Laccases have catalysed  the 
metabolic processes for several phenolic compounds 
and non -pheno lic substances. Because of their 
extensive substrate range, laccases can be utilized  in 
several uses in biotechnology  (Tabassum  et al ., 2022 ; 
Althobaiti  et al ., 202 2).  The current  evaluation was done to give academic and industry researchers a 
comprehensi ve background in laccase -related 
pharmacological a nd biological applications. First, an 
outline of laccases' biological roles was provided. 
Laccase -mediated techniques for imparting antibacterial 
and antioxidant characteristics to various surfaces were 
also explored (Mohit et al. , 2020) . 
 
 
Laccase catalysis phenolic and non - phenolic substrate activity . 
Laccase's role in degradation  of dye: The usage of 
dyes has  grown to the point that around 10,000 different 
dyestuffs are utilized and manufactured each year. The 
globe creates around 7×105-1×108 tons of dyestuff 
yearly; on average, one -tenth of this dyestuff enters the 
environment via industrial effluent. Some of  these dyes 
develop resistance to environmental (t emperature, light, 
pH) and biological in origin (microorganisms) variables 
(Adekunle et al ., 2017; Ba & Vinoth Kumar 2017) . 
Color may be removed from  wastewater using different 
physical and chemical processes such as oxidation as 
well as flocculation, while these procedures have 
drawbacks such as expense and the formation of 
chemical sludge. As a result, the creation of a biological 
process capable of acting on a diverse spectrum of 
waste is in high u ltimatum (Narayanan et al. , 2015)  
Bacterial laccase has several advantages over fungal 
laccases, including the ability to function in severe 
settin gs and tolerate salt (Jiang et al. , 2022; Rovalet ti et 
al., 2023) . 
Kumar et al . (2022 ) revealed that B. subtilis  WD23 
enzyme removed the color of difficult anthraquinone 
dyes (owing to an aromatic ring) such as Remazol 
Brilliant Blue R, methyl orange, Congo red, and  
Alizarin red at alkaline pH in the absence of nut rients 
and mediators. Furthermore, except for reactive 
yellow, thermoactivated laccase generated by B. 
subtilis  efficiently destroyed azo and anthraquinone 
Sudan orange G (SOG) dye.  
Laccase's role in  paper  and pulp  industry : 
Production, include recycling of paper firms confront 
several challenges to eliminate phenolic compounds 
such as lignin or for the creation of visible pulp 
characteristics. This may be accomplished by a variety 
of chemical -based procedu res, but they are extremely 
dangerous and contribu te to increasing environmental 
contamination. This results in the utilization  of 
ligninolytic together with hemicellulolytic enzymes, 
that finish the process  (Wani et al.,  2022a-c). 
Enzymatic deinking impro ves intensity, colour, ink that 
remain, and other properties while reduci ng energy and 
overall costs (Saxena & Singh Chauhan 2017; Virk et al., 2013  and Dhanjal  et al., 2022).  Enzyme -mediated 
bleaching of aged newspaper pulp improves whiteness 
or clarity by eliminating  the lignin ingredient (Garajová 
et al. , 2021;  Kumar et al., 2019) . 
Laccase's role in the textile i ndustry:  Laccases 
have the ability to decompose phenolic as well as 
aromatic amines, along with their substituted 
byproducts with different chemical groups (Sondhi  et 
al., 2015) . Due to this property of these enzymes, they 
can be employed in textile manufacturing to remove 
textile colors  as well phenols, as well a s for sewage 
purification. Due to their higher redox potential, 
laccases generated by fungus have been frequently used 
for the decomposition of colors found in textile 
effluents (Nguyen & Juang 2013; Plácido & Capareda, 
2015; Wandhwa et al., 2023) . Furthermore, due of their 
fascinating properties like quick production, low -cost 
medium, and stable nature, bacterial laccases can be 
applied to textile dye degradation .  
Laccase's role in degradation of pollutants: 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) having mos t 
common contaminant found in natural environments 
such as soil, air, an d water. They are composed of a 
benzene ring that has been organised in a linear in 
nature, sharp, or clustered shape (Bhandari  et al., 2021; 
Leong et al. , 2022) . The majority of these pollutants 
and intermediate steps are harmful to humans and 
carcinogenic to living beings. Because of their low 
affinity to water and slow breakdown rate, these 
aromatic hydrocarbons are harmful in  nature (Ihssen et 
al., 2015  and Rahayu  et al.,  2022 ). Few dat a exist to 
date that  demonstrates  the potential of bacterial sp. to 
digest xenobiotic substances (Debnath & Saha 2020; 
Zeng et al ., 2011) . Laccase enzyme is  thought to 
convert hydrocarbons that are p olycyclic aromatic t o 
quinines and then to carbon dioxide. When 
acena phthylene and acenapthylene are coupled with the 
mediator HBT, an enzyme converts them to 1,2 -
acenapthalenedione and 1,8 -napthelic acid (Madhavi & 
Lele 2009) . 
Laccase  and biosensor  technology : Laccase may 
react with phenolic compounds and can function on a Singh    et al.,               Biological Forum – An International Journal      15(9): 1046 -1051 (2023)                                         1049  variety of substrates, making it valuabl e in biosensor 
techn ology. When paired with a distinct physical device  
that works as a biosensor, oxygen, as well as other 
oxidizing substrates (particularly anilines, phenols etc.) 
catalyzed  by laccase are quickly detected.  
Laccase -based biosensors are g enerally classified into 
two types: those that assess enzyme spectrum variations 
(at an absorption intensity of 600 nm) and those that 
monitor voltage fluctuations from a oxygen sensor that 
is modified (Madhavi & Lele  2009 ; Mir et al ., 2022) .  
Immobilized alkali -toluene laccase on the  nitrocellulose 
cell membrane, which reacted linearly even  at low 
concentrations t o a range of substrates, including that  
include catechin, catechol, sy ringaldazine, and L -
DOPA.  
CONCLUSION S 
Finally, the current study includes thorough information 
on the occurrence, molecular cloning, structural 
features of various bacterial laccases, as  well as uses 
with laccase industrial p roduction. Laccase 
enhancement strategies include genetic modification 
and cloning in appropriate heterologous hosts for 
enzyme excessive production. Laccase enzyme may 
function on a number of substrates, purify a ran ge of 
pollutants, and oxidize  dangerous  substances, making it 
useful i n the paper production, Fiber production, pulp 
as well as in textile industries, among others. Usage of 
cheap resources for laccase manufacture has recently 
been examined. A novel concep t in the manufacturing 
sector wastewate r handling in this context is h arnessing 
its nutritive ability to manufacture laccase. Aside from 
solid trash, drainage from the agriculture and food 
processing sector is of especially significant 
importance. Second, laccase is essential for the 
breakdown of wide range of pollutants and  phenols. 
Major problem with this enzyme is due to its limited 
specificity for substrates and can potentially catalyse a 
wide variety of reactions. As a result, more research 
regarding t his topic is extremely important. In addition, 
despite several attempt s to find out the function 
of laccase s in lignocellulose transformation, the subject 
is still undetermined concerning the  role of laccase s in 
lignin decomposition in plant biomass, it ca n be 
utilized  as an enzymatic treatment me thod for cellulosic 
producti on of ethanol. In the future, researchers should 
pay greater attention to these issues. As a result, it will 
not be surprising that such an enzyme is being 
thoroughly explored and is goi ng to  continue to do so in 
the future.  
FUTURE  SCOPE  
The future scope of research on bacterial laccases is 
promising, with opportunities in expanding 
biotechnological applications, customizing enzyme 
properties through genetic engineering, advancing 
green chemis try, integrating with nanotechnology, 
exploring synergistic enzy me combinations, 
contributing to sustainability initiatives, developing 
regulatory frameworks, and enhancing economic 
viability. Global collaboration, public education, and 
exploration o f emer ging markets will also shape the future  of bacterial laccase res earch, offering innovative 
and sustainable solutions across various industries.
