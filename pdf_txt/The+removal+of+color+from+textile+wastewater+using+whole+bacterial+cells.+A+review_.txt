Abstract : In Karur, the textile factories discharge millions of litres of untreated effluents into the drains that 
eventually empty into river, Amaravathy. The release of coloured compound into water bodies is undesirab le not 
only because of their impact on photosynthesis of aquatic plants but also due to the carcinogenic nature of these 
dyes and their breakdown products. In this work, bacteria  capable of decolourising  Textile effluents mixed with 
sewage (TES) were isolated. Based on the results of these various biochemical tests , the isolate s were identified.  
The identification was conformed by 16s rRNA sequencing.  They were identified as Bacillus cereus AK1968 and 
Pseudomonas sp. AKDYE14.  The sequences were deposited in GENBANK. The accession numbers were 
JN689235 and JN674167  respectively.

I. Introduction  
 1.1  Amaravathy  river basin at the down stream of Karur  Town is severely polluted due to discharge of 
partially treated effluent by the textile bleaching and dyeing units. At present 487 bleaching and dyeing units are 
in operation. These bleaching and dyeing units are located on either side of Amaravathy  river  within 2 Km from 
the river. By average one unit generates 30 kilo litres per day (KLD) of trade effluent. These units have provided 
either individual effluent treatment plant (IETP) or joined in common effluent treatment plant (CETP). After 
treatment the effluent is discharged into river Amaravathy . The total dissolve solids (TDS) in the river discharge 
is in the range of 5000 – 10000 mg/L and the chloride is in the range of 2000 – 4000 mg/L. Daily 14600 KLD of 
partially treated effluent is discharged into  the river.  The effluent reaching the river is in dark brown in colour. 
During summer period there is no water flow in river, only effluent flow can be noticed. In monsoon period the 
colour in river water can be  noticed up to Kattali where the river conflu ences with river Cauvery [1]. 
1.2  Dyes are usually aromatic and heterocyclic compounds and are often recalcitrant, some of them 
being toxic and even carcinogenic [2]. Many microorganisms are capable of degrading azo  dyes, including 
bacteria, fungi, and yeast [3]. The efforts of isolating dye -degrading bacteria started in the 1970s, when Bacillus 
subtilis was first isolated in 1977, followed by Aeromonas hydrophila in 1978 and Bacilus cereus in 1980. After 
that, sever al other dye -degraders such as Pseudomonas and Aeromonas strains were reported [4] (Banat et al., 
1996). Recently, bacterial cultures capable of degrading dyes were listed by Banat et al[4]. Pearce et al. [5] and 
Forgacs et al. [6]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of bacteria in monoculture to degrade dyes 
anaerobically and aerobically [4]. The effectiveness of microbial decolorization depends on the adaptability and 
the activity of selected microorganisms. A highly al kali thermostable  Bacillus  sp. SF isolated from the 
wastewater drain of a textile finishing company was found to be capable of degrading an azo dye [7]. An azo 
dye-reducing, endospore forming bacterium was isolated from textile industry wastewater that can  decolorize 
the azo dye Remazol Black B [8].  
1.3 Recently, several researchers have identified single bacterial strains that have very high efficacy for 
removal of azo dyes. In contrast to mixed cultures, the use of a pure culture has several advantages. These 
include predictable performance and detailed knowledge on the degradation pathways with improved assurance 
that catabolism of the dyes will lead to nontoxic end products under a given set of environmental conditions. 
Another advantage is that the bac terial strains and their activity can be monitored using culture -based or 
molecular methods to quantify population densities of the bacteria over time. Knowledge of the population 
density can be extrapolated to quantitative analysis of the kinetics of azo -dye decolourisation and mineralization 
[9]. Microorganisms have developed enzyme system for the decolourisation and mineralization of azo dyes 
under certain environmental conditions [9, 10, 11].  Preliminary characterization of the bacterial isolate Isolation, Identification And Characterisation Of Dye -Adapted Bacter ia From Textile Effluents Mixed  
www.iosrjournals.org                                                             52 | Page  regarding its morphological, biochemical characters and decolourisation activity as well as the molecular 
identity gives useful information with regard to the further application of strain for various purposes [12]. So, 
present study was designed to isolat e the dye adapted and efficient  dye decolourising  bacterial strains from their 
native habitat, the textile effluents mixed with sewage (TES) identify and characterise them.   
 
II. Materials And Methods  
2.1 Sample collection   
                The untreated textile effluents along with sewage were released into the river Amaravathy by small -
scale dyeing industries in Karur. Amaravathy  river basin is located between north latitude 10°06’51”   N  and 
11°02’10”   N  and longitudes   77°03’24”E and 78° 13’06” E in  Tamilnadu, India. Samples were collected in 
sterile plastic bottles from a place where these textile effluents and sewage (TES)  confluence with the river 
Amaravathy. Samples were transported to the laboratory in an ice -packed chest box within 1  hr of collection.  
 
2.2 Isolation of bacteria from TES  and Screening of bacterial isolates  
One ml of freshly collected TES was serially diluted (10-1 – 10-3) in physiological saline. A loopful  of 
each dilution was inoculated, by streaking onto triplicate set of agar plate  containing the basal medium . The 
basal medium  contained (gL-1): NaCl  - 0.3, MgSO 47H2O - 0.42, KCl - 0.29, K 2HPO4 -1.27, KH 2PO4 - 0.85, 
NaNO 3 - 0.42 and deionised water 1,000 m l. Agar No. 1 was added at 1.5% (w/v) to prepare solid medium. The 
plates were incubated at 37oC for 24 – 48hr. Morphologically different colonies B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 
developed were picked separately and inoculated separately into 10ml liquid broth and incubated at 37oC for 
24hr. Liquid Broth Medium  contained (g/L): Tryptone 10.0, Yeast 1.0, Agar 0.7, NaCl 10.0 & de -ionized 
water 1000ml. Both the media used were at pH 7.0. Sterilization was done by autoclaving at 121°C at 15psi for 
15min.  
  Triplicate set of 100ml Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 25ml of TES were inoculated with 1ml of a 
24hr liquid broth culture B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 separately. Two sets of controls were also set up: positive 
control consisted of duplicate flasks inoculate d with 1ml of heat -treated cells and negative controls consisted of 
uninoculated flasks.  The flasks were incubated at 37oC and observed daily for decolourisation of medium 
(evidence of degradation) and increase in turbidity (evidence of growth). The cultur es showing maximum 
turbidity and decolourisation were selected on the basis of spectrophotometer readings, identified and used for 
further studies.  Each agar plate (mixed with sterilized TES) was inoculated with a loopful of the culture. 
Incubation was don e at 37oC for 24 – 48hr. Colonies was picked and purified by repeated subculture and Gram 
stained. Colonies which were distinctly seen were used for various identification tests.  Various tests (motility, 
presence/absence of spore, urease, citrate utilizati on, hydrogen sulphide production, MR, VP, catalase, oxidase, 
indole, starch hydrolysis and fermentation of various sugars) were carried out according to the methods of [13] 
Cruickshank et al. [14] Garrity et al.  and  [15] Holts et al.    
 
2.3 16s rRNA seque ncing    
 Identification of the isolated strain that achieved the best decolourisation  was performed by 16S rDNA 
sequence analysis. 16S rRNA gene/DNA was  obtained according to [16] Pitcher et al .  using TE buffer, 
Lysozyme, Proteinase K, isopropanol  and ethanol . The 16SrRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the specific 
Primer sequences , the forward primer, 16sF - AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG and the reverse primer, 16sR - 
AAGGAGGTGWTCCARCC and the DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit for the automate d 
Mega Base 500 system (GE Healthcare)  [17]. The sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL X program and 
analyzed with the MEGA software 2001 [18, 19]. Evolutionary distances were derived from sequence -pair 
dissimilarities, calculated as implemented in MEGA, using Kimura’s DNA substitution model [20]. The 
phylogenetic reconstruction was done using the Neighbour Joining (NJ) algorithm, with bootstrap val ues 
calculated from 1000 replicate runs, using the routines included in the MEGA software [21]. 
 
III. Results  
Five different colonies B1, B2, B3, B4 and B5 were found to be growing in the medium with TES and 
they were isolated. On the basis of spectrophotometer readings it was found that the isolates B3 and B4 showed 
maximum hydrolysis whereas B1, B2 and B5 isolat es showed only slight hydrolysis in liquid broth (Table 1), 
thus they were not selected for further study of the dye degradation. The desired bacterial strains with strong 
decolourising ability on TES, B3 and B4, were isolated from TES and identified. The results of various 
biochemical characters were given in the Table 2.The colony of bacterial isolate B3 was circular, flat, and 
smooth. The bacteria of the isolate B3 was a gram positive rod shaped, non -motile and facultative anaerobic 
spore forming bacteri a. The optimum growth temperatures ranged from 30 to 50°C. They could grow at pH 
values of between 4.3 and 9.3. The organism produced heat resistant spores and these might germinate if 
cooling was too slow. They could hydrolyse casein, gelatin and starch, could reduce nitrate, and could produce Isolation, Identification And Characterisation Of Dye -Adapted Bacter ia From Textile Effluents Mixed

methyl red test, voges -proskauer test, and citrate catalase test.The bacteria of B4 colonies were rod shaped , 
gram -negative , aerobic , non–spore forming  bacteria. B4 species also typically showed a positive result to the 
catalase test, oxidase test , the absence of gas formation from glucose, indole  negative, methyl red  negative, 
Voges –Proskauer  test negative, and citrat e positive. The bacterial strains B3 and B4 were tentatively identified 
as Bacillus cereus  (Plates 1 to 4) and Pseudomonas  sp. (Plates 5 & 6) to respectively by referring to Bergey’s 
Manual of Determinative Bacteriology  [15]. Based on the phenotypic and bi ochemical characteristics and 
genetic and phylogenetic analysis, the new strains were identified and christened as B.cereus  AK1968 and 
Pseudomonas  sp. AKDYE 14. The 16S rDNA sequences of both of these bacteria were deposited in GenBank. 
The accession numbe rs were JN689235 and JN674167  respectively.

nitrate and sucrose and to decolourizes cibacron black PSG by 75% using yeast extract and lactose.  The 
preliminary decolourisation  studies carried out with bacteria species isolated from the dye effluents, indicated 
that B. cereus performed best when compared to Mycobacterium acidophilus and Streptococcus faecalis [22]. 
Pseudomonas  sp.(99%) which has been proved to have decolourising  ability against both azo and 
triphenylmethane dyes [23] . Based on the phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, strain was 
identified as Pseudomonas  sp.  
Heterotrophic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli , Bacillus  sp. Pseudomonos  sp., Staphylo coccus  sp., 
etc., are usually dominant in the activated sludge system, degrading and eventually mineralizing organic 
compounds to carbon dioxide and water  [24, 25].  
             A study discovered effluent adapted strains of Acinetobacter, Bacillus and Legionella with potentials for 
colour removal and strains of Acinetobacter, Bacillus and Pseudomonas with potential use for COD removal. 
The municipal landfill site soils yielded strains of Bacillus  sp. with potentials for use in colour  and COD 
removal. This may be due to the significant exposure of these organisms to a myriad of chemicals and materials 
some of which contain dyes which are deposited in the landfill which may cause a release of dyes to the soil 
[25] strain of bacterium Bacillus subtilis with strong decolourising ability was isolated from Textile effluent to 
decolorize the textile Azo dye Crystal violet (100 mg/L) within 24hr in aerobic and static conditions  [26]. [27] 
Khadijah et al  reported 1540 bacterial isolates and sc reened for their ability to degrade selected azo dyes.  
Interestingly, the bacterial species used in carrying out the decolorization of Azo dye Crystal violet was 
isolated from the textile dye industry waste effluent. The bacterial strain Bacillus subtilis showed decolourising 
activity through a degradation mechanism rather than adsorption. This observation has established that the 
bacteria are adaptive in nature and can degrade contaminants. The ability of the strain to tolerate, decolorize azo 
dyes at high  concentration gives it an advantage for treatment of textile industry waste waters. However, 
potential of the strain needs to be demonstrated for its application in treatment of real dye bearing waste waters 
using appropriate bioreactors [26]. 
A wild -type isolate Pseudomonas luteola was able to decolorize reactive black B while P. aeruginosa 
NBAR12 was capable of decolourising  12 different dyes  [28]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also reported to 
decolorize certain azo dyes . Many Pseudomonas strain s were also found to be capable of denitrification [4]. A 
total of 24 isolates were obtained; eighteen organisms belonging to the genera, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, 
Legionella, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas were isolated from the textile effluents (effluent -adapted bacteria) 
while six isolates belonging to the genus Bacillus were isolated from the landfill site (effluent non -adapted 
isolates) [26]. As observed by [3] Chen et al. , screening on solid media after adaptation and enrichment gave 
effective dye decolourising isolates; bacteria colonies with  decolourisation zone and fungi showing growth and 
decolourisation on solid culture  which were further picked out and enriched in the liquid media to develop the 
deferent decolourising consortium. Adapted loc al microbial isolates from textile wastewater contaminated sites 
can effectively be used in the aerobic treatment of these effluents before discharging into the environment  [29]. 
Reports indicate that though several microorganisms may seem to have a potent ial for dye degradation, 
very few strains can withstand the conditions of dyeing effluents, thus the effluent -adapted strains may be better 
candidates for potential bioremediative uses [30]. The bacterial isolates Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas sp. 
origin ated from the dye contaminated textile wastewater of local industry can easily adapt to the prevailing local 
environment. Microbial decolourisation and degradation is an environment friendly and cost -competitive 
alternative to chemical decomposition proces ses. Moreover decolourisation and degradation can also detoxify 
the effluent effectively without leaving any residues [31]. Microbial degradation of azo dyes by extra cellular 
enzymes in Pseudomonas sp., and  Pseudomonas luteola and Mycobacterium avium has already been reported  
[32]. Indvidual and synergistic effect s of B.cereus and Pseudomonas sp. have  been proved to be successful in  
degradation of dye house effluent in dye contaminated ecosystems [33]. 
 
V. Conclusion  
The use of microorganisms like bacteria and  fungi for the removal of synthetic dyes from  industrial 
effluent offers considerable advantages. The process is relatively  inexpensive, it is simple method and running 
costs are low, the end products of complete mineralization are not toxic. Therefore, th e bacterial strains 
identified in this work B.cereus AK1968 and Pseudomonas  sp.AKDYE14 can be used to develop an effective 
biological treatment system for the wastewaters contaminated with azo dyes.
