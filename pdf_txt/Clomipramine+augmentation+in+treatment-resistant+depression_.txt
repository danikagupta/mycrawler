reported  No Yes High Unclear if care providers 
blinded to treatment assignment, in particular whether providers or 
technicians set up the 
TMS/placebo procedure. Procedure for collecting all measures was 
inconsistent, sometimes 
collected by patients and sometimes collected by research assistants. Not 
possible to determine 
direction of potential bias resulting from this. Information on treatment 
completion, attrition, 
missing data are poorly reported, making it difficult 
to be confident about these 
elements. It is possible (but 
unclear) all participants 
completed treatment, but 
data missing for about 18% 
of sample. Although 
authors state that they 
used ITT analyses, lack of clear reporting of dropouts or missing data makes it 
difficult to confirm  that a 
true ITT analysis was 
perfo rmed.
