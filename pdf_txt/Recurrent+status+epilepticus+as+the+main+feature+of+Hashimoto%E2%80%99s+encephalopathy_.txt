Status epilepticus
Hashimoto's encephalopathyHashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is an infrequent disease with no well-known physiopathology. Status
epilepticus is rarely reported in association with HE. We describe the 7-year evolution of a young woman
who presented with recurrent status epilepticus as the main complication of HE. This evolution was
especially marked by the occurrence of steroid-refractory symptoms and a poor outcome with persistent cog-
nitive and behavioral consequences. We point out that the frontal lobes are especially implicated in these symp-
toms. This patient highlights the risk of multiple relapses and the need for a long follow-up period. We
describe her clinical and paraclinic al features, compare this patient to similar case reports, and comment
on her outcome.

1. Introduction
“Hashimoto's encephalopathy ”(HE), also called “steroid-responsive
encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis ”(SREAT), is a
rare condition that associates an encephalopathic state with an
autoimmune-mediated lymphocytic in ﬁltration of the thyroid gland
(Hashimoto's thyroiditis, HT). The physiopathology of HE remains
unknown. A humoral autoimmune process is supported by the ﬁnding
of antineuronal [1]or anti- α-enolase antibodies [2]. Other anti-CNS
autoantibodies could be involved in the occurrence of HE, which might
explain the variability of the clinical features [1].Av a s c u l i t i cp r o c e s si s
not excluded in some patients, supported by stroke-like symptoms and
necrotic sequelae observed on brain MRI [3]. Although it is not certain
whether they have a true physiopathologic meaning, the high titer of
antithyroid antibodies leads to the diagnosis of HE, after exclusion of
other causes of encephalopathy. The prevalence of HE is estimated at
2.1/100,000 [4]. Since a large panel of unspeci ﬁc neuropsychiatric symp-
toms can manifest during HE and before disclosing HT, its prevalence is
probably underestimated. Cognitive symptoms (as confusion, memory
loss, attention de ﬁcit,…), psychiatric symptoms (as hallucinations, psy-
chosis, anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, …), alteration of consciousness,seizure, tremor, ataxia, and stroke-like episodes can all be the
ﬁrst signs of the disease. Two clinical pictures were described by
Kothbauer-Margreiter et al., ad i f f u s ep r o g r e ssive type and a
vasculitic type with stroke-like episodes [5]. Seizures are reported in
both and more frequently in the diffuse type. Other authors reported sei-
zures in 66% of HE, including status epilepticus (SE) in 12% [6].F o c a l ,g e n -
eralized, myoclonic seizures and SE are described in association with HE.
As discussed by Ferlazzo et al., SE is generally resistant to antiepileptic
d r u g s( A E D s )a n dn e e d ss t e r o i d st oi m p r o v e [7]. To evaluate the outcome
of HE, only short series are reported. In a series of 20 patients with HE [5],
steroid responsiveness is excellent in 90%, relapses following steroid
dose reduction occur in 40%, immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs) are used
in 10%, persistent cognitive symptoms remain in 15%, and uncontrolled
relapses persist in 10%. Concerning the issue of SE as a complication of
HE, only a few cases are reported in the literature with often a short
follow-up period, rendering their late outcome not well known.
2. Case report
In 2006, a 26-year-old woman without relevant medical story
developed tremor, confusion, agitation, and blurred vision during a
few weeks. A ﬁrst episode of refractory generalized convulsive status
epilepticus (GCSE) followed and required anesthetic agents to im-
prove. A prolonged postictal status with bradypsychia, ataxia, and
tremor followed. The EEG was diffusely slowed. A slight right peri-
ventricular T2/FLAIR hyperintensity was observed on brain MRI. No
toxic, metabolic, or infectious etiologies were identi ﬁed. She recov-
ered but promptly had a second episode of refractory GCSE despiteEpilepsy & Behavior Case Reports 1 (2013) 113 –117

period was prolonged anew with encephalopathy status. The EEG
was diffusely slowed with occasional right frontal rhythmic theta
activity. The brain Tc99m-bicisate SPECT reported right frontotemporal
hypoperfusion and a focal right paramedian frontal hyperperfusion.
A mild elevation of protein content without oligoclonal bands was
found in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid. The autoimmune screening in the
serum disclosed high titers of antithyroglobulin (274 IU/mL, normal b
60 IU/mL) and antithyroperoxidase (602.8 IU/mL, normal b60 IU/mL)
antibodies, with euthyroid status. Thyroid ultrasound was compatiblewith thyroiditis status. Full body PET scan and CT scan did not reveal
neoplastic disease. Onconeural antibodies (anti-HU, anti-Yo, and anti-
Ri) were negative. The diagnosis of HE was probable. The EEG normal-
ized rapidly after intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day), and the
patient recovered. Phenytoin was discontinued. At this stage, her cogni-
tive functions were almost normal with small de ﬁcits for free recall
(episodic memory), selective attention, and verbal ﬂuency ( Table 1 ).
Ten months later, steroids were progressively reduced because of side
effects (osteoporosis, Cushing-like syndrome, diabetes). A generalized
convulsive seizure relapsed rapidly. Phenytoin and steroids were
discontinued after six courses of cyclophosphamide. For 3 years, she
was free of treatment and seizures. Postural tremor, nervousness, and
anxiety persisted. In 2010, she presented a short collapse without
prolonged postictal status and a transient slowed EEG. Antiepileptic
drug was transiently used. In 2011, she relapsed into a GCSE resistant
to lormetazepam, phenytoin, levetiracetam, and intravenous methyl-
prednisolone. A burst-suppression state was obtained with thiopental.
For two months, it followed an encephalopathy state with subtleSE of frontal origin. Plasmapheresis was performed. Different
antiepileptic drugs were used without success (phenytoin, pheno-
barbital, levetiracetam, lacosamide, and midazolam). The brain MRI
revealed T2 and FLAIR bilateral frontal hyperintensity spreading to
thalamic and mesiotemporal areas, without gadolinium enhancement
(Fig. 1 ). The brain PET scan showed bilateral frontal hyperactivity. The
EEG showed successively a drug-induced burst-suppression state, gen-eralized periodic epileptiform discharges, a diffuse slowing with subtle
seizures of frontal origin, and a progressive return of alpha rhythm
(Fig. 2 ). Three months later, both EEG and brain MRI normalized.
Two years later, frontal behavior, memory loss, and loss of autonomypersisted. The neuropsychological tests showed cognitive slowing,
poor spontaneous speech, apathy, poor orientation, episodic memo-
ry loss, perseverations, confabulations, and impairment of visuospa-
tial, attention, and executive functions ( Table 1). Myoclonia andtransient loss of consciousness relapse under 8 mg a day of oralmethylprednisolone. In 2013, she continues to use chronically
antiepileptic drugs (levetiracetam, phenytoin, and phenobarbital)
and low dose of oral methylprednisolone.
3. Discussion and conclusion
We report the 7-year follow-up of a young woman who presented with
recurrent status epilepticus associated with Hashimoto's encephalopathy.
This diagnosis is sustained by high titer of antithyroid antibodies
and the exclusion of other toxic, metabolic, infectious, or
paraneoplastic etiologies. Through lack of typical features oflimbic encephalitis or N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor antibody
(NMDAR-Ab) encephalitis, a complete screening of antibodies(Ab) against neuronal surface antigens (as voltage gate potassium
channel (VGKC) complex Ab, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)
Ab,α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasolepropionic acid receptor
(AMPAR) Ab, and gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor (GABAbR) Ab)has not been performed.
Only a few cases of status epilepticus associated with HE have been
reported, and some are shown in Table 2 . Including our cases, all present
the clinical diffuse progressive type of HE proposed by Kothbauer-Margreiter et al. with ﬁrst symptoms equally distributed between thy-
roid dysfunction, behavioral changes, or SE. This distribution emphasizesthe clinical variability and the necessity to look for antithyroid Ab in the
case of SE of unknown origin.
Her evolution was ﬁrst characterized by a frontal EEG and SPECT
focalization in the course of a GCSE episode. Later, while spike –wave
discharges showed a diffuse spreading leading to an especially prolongedNCSE, diffuse mesiotemporal and frontal postictal edema was observed
on the brain MRI. Seizures of frontal origin [14] or temporal origin
[15,16] have both been reported to be associated with HE. Among the
patients listed in Table 2 and using different diagnostic procedures
(brain MRI, PET scan, SPECT, or EEG), frontal dysfunction is morefrequently observed (6/10) than mesiotemporal dysfunction (1/10).
From a therapeutic point of view, her evolution was marked by
successive steroid responsiveness, steroid dependence, prolonged
remission after cyclophosphamide courses, late relapse of steroid-
resistant symptoms, and thereafter persisting steroid dependence.
No correlation could be made between the occurrence of steroid-
resistant symptoms and a delay in the beginning of intravenous
methylprednisolone. Steroid-resistant SE as a complication of HE
seems to be infrequent (2/11, including our patient and one patientTable 1

authors [5], a correlation has not been observed between relapses
and the level of antithyroid-Ab ( Fig. 3 ), sustaining the hypothesis
that they do not play a part in the physiopathological development
of HE.
The outcome of most patients (8/11) listed in Table 2 is favorable but
has been commonly observed in a short follow-up period and often
with ongoing steroid or ISD use, making the conclusions debatable.
Early (2/11) and late (2/11) relapses following suspension of steroid
or ISD use are reported. One death occurred in the course of a
steroid-resistant SE. Two (including our patient) remain cognitively de-ﬁcient as sequelae of prolonged steroid-resistant SE.
In conclusion, this case report emphasizes the possible frequent
relapses of SE as a complication of HE and the possible evolution to-
wards steroid-resistant SE. Clinicians should be aware that relapses
can occur early or even late after tapering of steroid or ISD use;
therefore, a long follow-up period should be advisable. Moreover,
since the antithyroid antibodies could not been used as markers ofencephalopathy's relapses, the question of the continuation of the
immunomodulatory of immunosuppressive drugs remains an open
debate.
