Abstract
Background: This research studied the effect of UV light on pentachlorophenol (PCP) removal in the 
electro-Fenton (EF) process.
Methods:  PCP was used as the pollutant in this study. The effects of Fenton’s reagent, i.e. hydrogen 
peroxide concentration, solution pH, and treatment time by EF (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) 
processes, were studied to determine rates of PCP removal. The results showed that a better performance 
and a high removal efficiency were achieved by coupling UV radiation and the EF process.
Results:  EF processes required more time to remove PCP , while after a reaction time of 10 minutes, the 
PEF achieved a removal efficiency of 90.4%; this value is higher than the maximum efficiency of the 
EF process (83.44% after 40 minutes). The kinetic mechanisms of both processes were examined and 
compared. The rate constants at optimum conditions were 0.0455 and 0.0579 min−1 for EF and PEF 
processes, respectively.
Conclusion:  Removal efficiency was obtained in the order of PEF > EF.
Keywords:  Ultraviolet rays, Reaction Time, Kinetics.

Introduction
The presence of phenol compounds in the environment 
has acute toxicity for mankind. Due to five chlorines on 
the pentachlorophenol (PCP) structure, it is the most toxic 
agent of chlorophenols (1). PCP can affect the nervous, 
digestive, and respiratory systems and lead to cancer in 
humans. It is used in pesticides, disinfectants, and wood 
preservatives (2). PCP remains in the environment because 
of the unsuitable disposal of industrial wastes containing 
PCP and its pertinacity. Thus, the treatment of phenolic 
pollutants before disposal is very important. It is necessary 
to find a highly effective method to treat PCP waste (3). 
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are more efficient 
than conventional methods. They are able to oxidize 
and mineralize most organic compounds, including bio-
recalcitrant ones, by producing highly reactive and non-
selective oxidants called hydroxyl radicals (HO) (4). AOPs 
include two steps of oxidation: the formation of hydroxyl 
radicals, and the reaction of these radicals with an organic 
compound (5).
Conventional biological wastewater treatment processes 
are inefficient for the removal of recalcitrant organic compounds that are the main sources of pollutants in 
industrial effluent. The electro-Fenton (EF) process 
is known as a powerful and environmentally-friendly 
technology for the removal of this compound from 
wastewaters (6). In the EF process, highly oxidative 
hydroxyl radicals are formed from the reaction between 
H2O2 and Fe2+ (7). The Fenton process includes the 
following reactions (8,9):
H2O2 + Fe2+ → OH• + OH− + Fe3+                                       [1]
OH• + RH →R• + H2O                                                            [2]
R• + H2O2→ROH + OH•                                                                                              [3]
OH• + H2O2 →HO2• + H2O                                                    [4]
Fe3+ + HO2•→ Fe2+ + H+ + O2                                                                                [5]
Fe2+ + HO2•→ Fe3+ + HO2−                                                     [6]
Fe2+ + OH• → Fe3+ + OH−                                                                                             [7]
H2O2 + Fe2+ → FeO2+ + H2O                                                 [8]
FeO2+ + H2O2→ O2 + H2O                                                    [9]
In the Fenton process Fe2+ is consumed faster than it 
is produced. The EF method solved this problem by 
regenerating Fe2+ in the cathode according to the following 
reaction (10):
Fe3+ + e- → Fe2+                                                                     [10]Environmental Health

Environmental Health Engineering and Management Journal 2017, 4(4), 203–207204The photoelectron-Fenton (PEF) process can regenerate a 
large amount of Fe2+ by solution irradiation with UV light 
by the following reaction (11):
(Fe–OH) 2+ +hv→ Fe2+ +OH•                                                                             [11]
Furthermore, in the PEF mechanism, hydroxyl radicals 
can be produced from H2O2 in the presence of UV 
radiation (11,12):
H2O2 +hv→ 2OH•                                                                                                              [12]
Recently, different usages for the EF process have been 
found, for example, the treatment of landfill leachate 
(13), phenol degradation (14), the effect of UV light on 
acetaminophen degradation in the EF process (15), COD 
and color removal from landfill leachate (16-18). 
According to our previous study (19,20), PCP has been 
successfully removed in the EF and sonoelectro-Fenton 
processes, but the effect of UV light on PCP removal in 
the EF process has not yet been studied. Thus, the current 
study investigated the effects of UV radiation on PCP 
removal in the EF process. The influence of operating 
parameters such as H2O2 concentration, pH, and treatment 
time of PCP on degradation was investigated. The reaction 
kinetics were studied to find the removal mechanism and 
compare it with the EF results.
Methods
PCP 98.5% and H2O2 (30%) were purchased from Merck. 
Sodium sulfate 99.5% (used as an electrolyte), H2SO4, 
and NAOH were obtained from Merck. Concentrated 
hydrochloric acid was used for electrode washing. 
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined using 
the open reflux method (21). The efficiencies of PCP 
degradation and COD removal were defined as:
COD removal efficiency = Δ [COD] /COD0 = ([CODf-
COD0] /COD0) ×100
where [COD]0 and [COD]f are the COD concentrations in 
the solution at 0 minute and at the end of each reaction, 
respectively. A divided double-electrode electrochemical 
cell was used in this study. The reactor was a glass beaker 
with a volume of 400 mL. The cathodes and anodes 
of the reactors were a piece of steal (st37). The same 
experimental set-up as the EF process was used in the 
photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) process. The addition of eight 
UVC lamps with a frequency of 247 nm was used. The pH 
of the solutions was adjusted using concentrated sulfuric 
acid (H2SO4) and sodium hydroxide (0.1 M). A DC power 
supply used to provide reasonable voltage was connected 
to the electrodes, and 250 mL solution was prepared by 
determining the initial PCP concentration (15 mg/L) and 
then adding sodium sulfate as the electrolyte (2000 mg/L). 
The initial pH of the solutions was set. The conductivity 
of the medium was fixed by adding Na2SO4 (2000 mg/L). 
Then, 250 mL of sample was transferred to the E-F 
reactor. After adding the required amount of H2O2, 8-watt 
UVC lights were turned on and the PEF experiment was 
started. The EF set-up was the same as the PEF process but 
without UV lights.Results  
Figure 1 shows the effect of initial H2O2 concentration on 
PCP removal efficiency at a constant PCP concentration 
of 15 mg/L, voltage of 24 V , and pH = 3 after a reaction 
time of 40 minutes by EF and PEF processes. Under these 
operational conditions, the PCP removal efficiency rates 
in both processes were increased with increases in H2O2 
concentration. The effect of pH (3–7) on PCP removal 
was studied using both processes, and the results are 
shown in Figure 2. Experiments were performed using 
an initial PCP concentration of 15 mg/L, reaction time 
of 40 minutes, and H2O2 concentration of 200 m mole/L. 
A voltage of 24 V was maintained for the EF and PEF 
processes. The effects of treatment time on PCP removal 
efficiency at an initial PCP concentration of 15 mg/L, pH 
of 3, and H2O2 concentration of 200 m mole/L at a voltage 
of 24 V in the EF and PEF processes are shown in Figure 
3. In the kinetics study, the zero-, first-, and second-
order models were analyzed separately to determine the 
behavior of PEF reactions. Modeling of PCP removal by 
pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and zero-order 
equations is shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6, respectively.

Discussion
Effect of H2O2 concentration
The highest removal of PCP presented at an H2O2 
concentration of 200 mM in both processes. The maximum PCP removal efficiency of 90% was observed in the EF 
process at the H2O2 concentration of 200 mM, while a 
removal efficiency of 92% was observed in the PEF at an 
H2O2 concentration of 100 mM. This phenomenon was 
due to an OH• production from reactions 11 and 12. The 
difference in PCP removal efficiency was insignificant in 
the PEF processes. Thus, high efficiency can be achieved 
by adding the lowest amount of H2O2 concentration in the 
PEF process, and it is economical. In the AOP , H2O2 is the 
main source of hydroxyl radical production according to 
reaction 1. The excess amount of H2O2 has a scavenger 
effect, so finding the lowest concentration of H2O2 for 
higher removal efficiency is very important (1,10,11,22). 
In the PEF process, UV light reduces the scavenging 
effect and generates a greater amount of hydroxyl radicals 
according to Eq. [12] (1). This result was observed in 
several other studies, including the effect of UV light on 
acetaminophen degradation in the EF process (10) and 
treatment of landfill leachate by PEF process (11).
Effect of pH
It is well known that advanced oxidation reactions occur in 
low pH values (13). Hydroxyl radicals have high oxidation 
ability in acidic mediums (1). The results showed that 
PCP removal efficiency is significantly affected by pH. 
The maximum PCP removal was observed at pH 3 (93.6% 
in PEF process). Increasing pH from 3 to 7 reduced the 
amount of PCP removed for both process. This is due to 
the reduction in hydroxyl oxidation potential in high pH 
values. At high pH values, ferric hydroxide was formed 
and caused the low generation of hydroxyl radicals 
(1,20). At higher pH values, electro-coagulation starts 
in the reactor because of the conversion of Fe2+ and Fe3+ 
to Fe (OH)n-type structures (1,13). Increasing pH to a 
value beyond 3 affected the removal efficiency because 
of the transformation of ferrous ions (Fe2+) to ferric iron 
(Fe3+). By adding UV light radiation to the EF process, it 
is possible to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ and generate hydroxyl 
radicals according to the following reaction (3): 
Fe(OH)2+hv→Fe2+ + •OH                                                     [13]
Hydroxyl radicals produced in these reactions are used for 
PCP removal at higher pH values. In this situation, PEF 
processes could be used at a near neutral pH and reduce 
the problems created by acidic effluent treatment (1). This 
result was observed in several other studies, including 
advanced oxidation of phenol by EF and SEF process (1), 
COD and color removal from synthetic textile wastewater 
by SEF process (22), and PCP removal by SEF (20).
Effect of treatment time
As shown in Figure 3, the PCP removal efficiency of the 
EF and PEF processes was increased by increasing the 
reaction time; in the PEF process, a removal efficiency of 
90.4% was obtained after a reaction time of 10 minutes; 
this value is higher than the maximum efficiency of the 
EF process (83.44% after 40 minutes). These phenomena  020406080100120

Kinetics of pentachlorophenol removal
According to our previous studies, the removal of PCP by 
the EF process can be represented as (20):
PCP + OH• → Oxidation products                                   [14]
As described in our previous study, the zero-order, first-
order, and second-order reaction kinetics, respectively, 
can be written as shown below, and the removal of PCP 
by the EF process followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics 
(20):
C= C0 –k0t                                                                         [15]
lnC –lnC0 = - kappt                                                               [16]
1/C =1/C0 – Kt                                                                   [17]
The correlation coefficients for the PCP removal kinetics 
of zero-, pseudo-first, and second order were 0.5216, 
0.6265, and 0.5805, respectively. The comparison of the 
correlation coefficients indicated a good agreement 
between the removal kinetics and the pseudo-first order 
models. The results of zero-, first-, and second-order 
reaction kinetics for PCP removal in EF and PEF processes 
are summarized in Table 1.
Figure 7 shows the comparison of the results of the 
first-order kinetics models for both the EF and the PEF 
method, and it shows that the rate constants of the EF and 
PEF processes are 0.0455 and 0.0579, respectively. The 
same results were reported by other studies (1,10,20).
Conclusion
This study investigated the effects of UV radiation 
combined with EF for the removal of PCP from aqueous 
solutions. The results indicated that both the EF and PEF processes were effective in removing PCP from wastewater. 
The effects of changing the H2O2 concentration was clearer 
in the PEF process than in the EF process. At low H2O2 
injection amounts, adding UV A irradiation enhanced 
the PCP removal rate in the PEF process because of the 
greater production of OH• in the PEF process. Another 
advantage of combining UV and EF was that it could act at 
high pH values near the neutral pH and solve the problems 
associated with acidic effluent. From the kinetic studies, 
both processes followed the first-order reaction. The rate 
constant values at optimum conditions were equal to 
0.0455 and 0.0579 min−1 for the EF and PEF processes, 
respectively. The following items are recommended as 
subjects for further research: studying the efficiency 
of PCP removal from aqueous solutions by sequential 
sono-photoelecro-Fenton; repeating this process for real 
wastewater.
