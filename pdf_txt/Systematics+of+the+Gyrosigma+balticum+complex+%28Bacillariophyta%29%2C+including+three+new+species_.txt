Abstract
Gyrosigma rostratum , sp. nov. , a new diatom species from the low intertidal zone, Xiamen Bay, southern China, was studied 
with light and scanning electron microscopy. The valves are lanceolate with protracted rostrate apices, symmetrical to both 
apical and transapical axis, not sigmoid. The raphe is straight, with a raphe angle of approximately two degrees. The external 
central raphe endings turn in the same direction and are isomorphic. The unique characteristic of the valve is that a conopeum 
(a lunate flap of silica, approximately 0.8–1.1 µm wide by 4.4–4.8 µm long) covers the terminal axial area and two rows of 
areolae near each apex. Gyrosigma rostratum  is epipsammic and lives in marine habitats.
Key words:  Benthic diatom, diatom flora, ecotone, intertidal sand-flats, symmetrical biraphid
Introduction
Reid (2012) gave the number of currently accepted species in Gyrosigma  Hassall (1845: 435) as a little over 200. 
From the 19th century through to today, and especially in more recent decades, delimitation of the generic boundaries 
for Gyrosigma  have been studied (Reid 2012). Earlier, Thaler and Kaczmarska (2009) were able to summarize the 
salient morphological features to allow identification of species placed in Gyrosigma.  These characters included the 
longitudinal to transapical striae ratio (Sterrenburg 1991, 1994, 1995), the deflection of the central raphe endings 
(Sterrenburg 1993), the structure of the central bars of silica (Cardinal et al.  1989, Reid and Williams 2003) and the 
presence or absence of a crescent of apical micropores above the terminal raphe endings (Sterrenburg 1991, Reid and 
Williams 2003). Based on these features, Thaler and Kaczmarska described the new species Gyrosigma orbitum from 
eastern Canada (Thaler and Kaczmarska 2009). 
 Round et al.  (1990) placed Pleurosigma  W. Smith (1852: 2) and Gyrosigma  in the family Pleurosigmataceae, 
pointing out clear differences in the stria systems of both genera (one longitudinal and one transversal for Gyrosigma ; 
one transversal and two oblique for Pleurosigma ) and in plastid morphology and raphe-sternum structure between 
Gyrosigma  and Pleurosigma : two large plate-like plastids per cell and, internally, the raphe-sternum thickening on one 
side of the raphe for Gyrosigma ; two or four ribbon-like plastids per cell and the raphe-sternum thickening internally 
approximately equally on both sides of the raphe for Pleurosigma . Thus, these morphological features should be 
included in the identification of species in Gyrosigma .
 Diatom studies in China lack international exposure. There is little information on China’s marine littoral diatom 
flora, including, among others, species in the genera  Gyrosigma  and Pleurosigma . Jin and Liu (1979) reported some 
new species and new records in Pleurosigma  and Gyrosigma . The only comprehensive Chinese marine diatom flora 
was published by Jin et al.  (1982, 1992); however, their images are not of good quality. Gyrosigma (‘sinensis’ ) sinense  
(Ehrenberg) Desikachary (1988: 11; basionym: Navicula sinensis  Ehrenberg 1847: 485) was typified by Jahn and 
Sterrenburg, Ehrenberg’s type material being from China (“ Blumenerde Canton A aus China  (Potting soil A from 
Canton, China)”, Jahn and Sterrenburg 2003: 62). They discussed the species limits of G. sinense using additional 
material from the coast of Cameroon and Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, and the coast of Brazil, but were not able to LIU ET AL. 260   •   Phytotaxa  203 (3) © 2015 Magnolia Press(1975: 207) but the poles were not shown in detail (Montgomery and Miller 1978: plate 110, figs. C–D). Gyrosigma 
rostratum is different from G. inflatum  in the outline of its valve (straight vs. sigmoid), length of valve (57–93 µm vs. 
200–220 µm) and the location of the conopeum (this does not appear in the central area for G. rostratum ). Conopea 
have also been found in other genera such as Fallacia  Stickle & D. G. Mann in Round et al.  (1990: 554), Mastogloia 
Thwaites ex W. Smith (1856: 63), Microcostatus  Johansen & Sray (1998: 93), Nitzschia  Hassall (1845: 435) and 
Sellaphora  Mereschowsky (1902: 186). Details of the conopea are best viewed with the SEM but may be visible with 
the light microscope as longitudinal lines near the raphe ( e.g. Mann & Trobajo 2014) or as unornamented areas of the 
valve face ( e.g. Potapova 2011). The conopeum in G. rostratum is discernible in the bright-field photographs (Figs. 
3–4) but its unique shape can only be confirmed with SEM (Fig. 14). The functions of the conopeum need further study 
(some conopea have been found to contain symbiotic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, Round et al.  1990); it is highly 
unlikely that all structures that have been named or interpreted as conopea are homologous and further investigation of 
the nature of various these structures is needed. 
 Homolateral deflection of external central raphe fissures appears to be rare in Gyrosigma . From external views of 
an epitheca and a hypotheca of G. rostratum  (Figs. 12–13, 15–16), it is easy to notice that the epitheca and hypotheca are 
mirror images. The external proximal raphe fissures of the two valves ( i.e. epitheca and hypotheca) are superimposed 
one above the other in a frustule. Therefore, G. rostratum is an isomorphic species according to Sterrenburg (1993). 
At least four species have this homolateral deflection which have been confirmed in SEM, including G. rostratum , G. 
fogedii , G. littorale (W. Smith) Griffith & Henfrey (1856: 303; basionym: Pleurosigma littorale  (litorale ) W. Smith 
1852: 10; see Sterrenburg 1992) and G. macrum  (W. Smith) Griffith & Henfrey (1856: 303; basionym: Pleurosigma 
macrum  W. Smith 1853: 67; see Cardinal et al.  1989). Gyrosigma rostratum  could not be confused with G. littorale  
and G. macrum  but it bears some resemblance to G. fogedii  as both have fairly straight valve outlines.
 of all our 32 sampling sites (29 of which will be reported later), G. rostratum  is only found in three low sand 
intertidal zones, two of which (Huizhan Centre and Zengcuo Village) yielded a small number of specimens of G. 
rostratum . To discern whether it occurs in middle or high intertidal zones, a further distributional survey is needed.
