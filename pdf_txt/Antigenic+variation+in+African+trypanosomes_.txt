Studies  on  Variant  Surface  Glycoproteins  (VSGs)  and  antigenic  variation  in  the  African  trypanosome,
Trypanosoma brucei , have yielded a  remarkable  range  of  novel  and  important  insights.  The  features  ﬁrst
identiﬁed  in  T.  brucei  extend  from  unique  to  conserved-among-trypanosomatids  to  conserved-among-
eukaryotes. Consequently, much of what we now  know  about  trypanosomatid  biology  and  much  of  the
technology available  has  its  origin  in  studies  related  to  VSGs.  T.  brucei  is  now  probably  the  most  advanced
early branched eukaryote in terms of experimental  tractability  and  can  be  approached  as  a  pathogen,  as  a
model for  studies  on  fundamental  processes,  as  a  model  for  studies  on  eukaryotic  evolution  or  often  all  of
the above. In terms of antigenic variation  itself,  substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  understanding  the
expression  and  switching  of  the  VSG  coat,  while  outstanding  questions  continue  to  stimulate  innovative
new approaches. There are large numbers  of  VSG  genes  in  the  genome  but  only  one  is  expressed  at  a
time,  always  immediately  adjacent  to  a  telomere.  DNA  repair  processes  allow  a  new  VSG  to  be  copied
into the single transcribed  locus.  A  coordinated  transcriptional  switch  can  also  allow  a  new  VSG  gene  to  be
activated without  any  detectable  change  in  the  DNA  sequence,  thereby  maintaining  singular  expression,
also known as allelic exclusion.  I  review  the  story  behind  VSGs;  the  genes,  their  expression  and  switching,
their central  role  in  T.  brucei  virulence,  the  discoveries  that  emerged  along  the  way  and  the  persistent
questions relating to allelic exclusion  in  particular.

1. Introduction
Variant Surface  Glycoproteins  (VSGs )  are  developmentally
regulated  genes that mediate  immune  evasion.  Activated  in  the
tsetse-ﬂy  salivary-gland [1],  and  inactivated  upon  return  to  the
tsetse-ﬂy  mid-gut,  they  produce  a  protective  cell  coat  throughout
the  mammalian  infectious  cycle.  The  coat  must  provide  robust

tissue-spaces  of  their  hosts  and  are  fully  exposed  to  immune
surveillance  in  this  hostile  environment.  Indeed,  as  an  infection
persists,  the  vast  majority  of  the  parasite  population  is  periodi-
cally  eliminated.  The  key  features  underlying  successful  immune
evasion  are  clone-speciﬁc  singular  VSG  expression  combined  with
switching  from  one  VSG  to  another.  The  metacyclic  cells  in  the
salivary  gland  are  challenging  to  study  since  VSG  expression  is
heterogeneous  during  this  phase  and  the  yield  of  T.  brucei  from
ﬂies  is  limiting.  Most  studies,  therefore,  have  been  conducted  using
bloodstream forms,  more  recently  in  axenic  culture.  Antigenic

variation  continues  to  operate  in  this  environment  [2]  indicating
that  host  antibodies  are  selective  rather  than  a  trigger  for  variation.
An  advantage  here  is  that  VSG  switching  operates  at  a  frequency  of
approximately  1  switch/105cells  per  population  doubling,  allowing
the  analysis  of  almost  homogeneous  but  switchable  populations.
Many  seminal  discoveries  have  emerged  from  studies  on  VSGs
in  T.  brucei  and  the  drive  to  understand  VSGs  and  their  expression
has  also  led  to  the  development  of  many  of  the  tools  and  technolo-
gies  now  available  for  a  range  of  other  studies  on  trypanosomatids.
Indeed,  studies  on  VSG  expression  revealed  much  of  what  we  now
know  about  gene  expression  in  trypanosomatids.  Some  features  are
speciﬁc  to  VSG  gene  expression  sites,  while  others  operate  across
the  genome  and  are  conserved  in  trypanosomatids  that  do  not
express  VSGs .  Thus,  work  on  VSGs  has  informed  studies  on  other
important  parasites,  including  Trypanosoma  cruzi  and  Leishmania
species.  VSGs  in  T.  b.  gambiense ,  T.  b.  rhodesiense ,  T.  equiperdum ,  T.
congolense  and  T.  vivax  are  not  discussed  in  detail  here  but  a  sim-
ilar  system of gene  expression  and  antigenic  variation  appears  to
operate  in  T.  brucei  brucei  and  in  these  other  African  trypanosomes.
What I present  below  is  a  somewhat  historical  perspective  on
antigenic  variation  in  T.  brucei  and,  in  this  regard,  I  recommend
further reading of  some  of  the  older  papers  in  particular,  not  often
cited  these  days  but  often  impressive  when  viewed  in  this  historical
context. It is  also  worth  noting  that  few  studies  on  antigenic  vari-
ation  in  T.  brucei  have  been  or  are  currently  speciﬁcally  focussed
on  the  prospect  of  a  therapy  in  the  short  term.  The  central  role  of
VSGs  in  virulence  does  mean  that  improved  knowledge  in  this  area
is  likely  to  present  further  opportunities  for  intervention,  however.
2.  A  very  brief  early  history  –  pre  VSG  gene-cloning
Sir  David  Bruce  had  read  David  Livingstone’s  reports  on  the
tsetse  ﬂy  diseases  known  as  nagana  in  cattle  and  sleeping  sickness
in  humans  and,  while  searching  for  the  cause  more  than  100  years
ago,  reported  that“  a  rapidly  moving  object  was  seen  lashing  about
among  the  red  blood  corpuscles  .  .  .  probably  a  trypanosome”  [3].
Bruce  also  noted  “the  parasites  come  and  go  in  the  blood”  and
Franke  &  Ehrlich  had  deduced  in  1905  that  T.  brucei  acquired  prop-
erties  that  conferred  resistance  to  host  “defensive  substances”.
Ronald  Ross  and  others  then  enumerated  the  relapsing  para-
sitaemia  in  patients  [4],  albeit  treated  with  several  different  drugs
during  monitoring  in  this  case.  A  number  of  parasitic  infections
of  mammals  are  now  known  to  display  relapses  due  to  the  emer-
gence  of  new  variants  that  are  no  longer  susceptible  to  the  latest
host  immune  response  (Fig.  1A).
In  the  1960s,  Keith  Vickerman’s  work  using  electron  microscopy
revealed  the  dense  T.  brucei  coat  responsible  for  clone-speciﬁc
relapses  [5].  The  identiﬁcation  and  puriﬁcation  of  the  coat  proteins
by  George  Cross  followed  in  the  1970s  [6]  and  then  the  cloning
and  sequencing  of  the  corresponding  cDNA  in  the  late  1970s  and
early  1980s  (detailed  below).  The  VSG  responsible  for  clone-speciﬁc
immunity or  antigenic  variation  were  found  to  be  Variant  through-
out  much  of  their  length,  they  were  known  to  represent  the  major
component  of  the  trypanosome  Surface  coat  and  they  were  Glyco-
proteins ,  decorated  with  multiple  sugar  residues  [6].
3.  The  variant  surface  glycoprotein  coat
The  15  nm  thick  VSG  coat  covers  the  entire  cell  and  is  an
essential  virulence  factor.  Formed  from  approximately  10  million
molecules  of  approximately  60  kDa,  the  coat  represents  up  to  20%
of  total  cell  protein  [6],  facilitating  the  production  of  antisera  that
recognise  distinct  VSGs  [7].  VSGs  are  present  at  the  cell  surface
as homodimers  and,  despite  extreme  sequence  divergence,  dis-
play  remarkably  similar  structures  [8],  partly  due  to  a  conserved
Fig.  1.  VSG  expression  and  switching.  (A)  VSG  switching  brings  about  antigenic
variation.
 Combined  with  successive  immune  responses,  this  can  generate  a  relaps-
ing
 parasitaemia.  Natural  infections  are  more  complex  than  this  highly  simpliﬁed
schematic.
 (B) Studies on VSG  expression  revealed  some  unusual  features.  The  sin-
gle expressed  VSG  was  found  to  be  ﬂanked  by  distinct  repetitive  sequences.  Three
further
 unusual  features  are  indicated  (boxes).
arrangement  of  disulphide  bonds.  Coat  exchange  during  a  VSG-
switch  appears  to  be  primarily  by  dilution  during  cell  division  since
cells  divide  approximately  every  6  h  with  shedding  and  turnover
being  relatively  much  slower  [9].  Cytokinesis  is  in  fact  dependent
upon  VSG  supply  as  demonstrated  by  knockdown  experiments
[10] .  The  VSG  is  not  a  transmembrane  protein  but  is  rather  anchored
in the  membrane  by  glycosylphosphatidylinositol  (GPI).  Indeed,  GPI
was  discovered  in  T.  brucei  and  this  yielded  the  ﬁrst  GPI  structure
[11]  as  well  as  a  description  of  GPI  biosynthesis  [12] .  GPI  anchors
were  subsequently  discovered  in  mammals  and  in  other  cells  [13]
but the  biosynthetic  pathways  do  display  differences  [14] .
The ﬂuid  nature  of  the  VSG  coat  allows  for  a  remarkably  high
rate  of  recycling  involving  endocytosis  at  the  ﬂagellar  pocket  [15] .
This  allows  the  coat  to  be  cleansed  of  antibodies,  at  low  titre  at
least,  and  this  requires  vigorous  directional  cell  motility  mediated
by  the  ﬂagellum  [16] .  VSG  coats  are  highly  immunogenic  however,
so  once  antibody  titre  increases,  the  vast  majority  of  parasites  are
eliminated  and  only  cells  with  distinct  VSG  coats  survive.  As  well
as  this  variable  function,  the  VSG  coat  also  serves  to  protect  less
variable  or  even  invariant  surface  proteins  from  immune  effectors.
Comparison  of  the  genome  sequences  of  T.  brucei ,  T.  congolense  and
T.  vivax  revealed  not  only  how  VSG  repertoires  evolved  [17]  but  also
allowed  reconstruction  of  a  surface  phylome  [17] .  This  revealed
a  diversity  of  potential  non-VSG  surface  proteins,  nutrient  recep-
tors  and  other  ‘invariant’  surface  glycoproteins.  It  appears  that  the
densely packed  and  thick  VSG  coat  can  physically  obstruct  access
to  these  proteins  by  conventional  immunoglobulins  while  selec-
tively  allowing  access  to  smaller  molecules  such  as  nutrients  [18] .
Nanobodies  also  have  the  potential  to  access  the  less  variable  epi-
topes  usually  hidden  within  the  coat  by  the  size  exclusion  limit
[19] .
4. VSG genes  and  their  subtelomeric  environment
Access  to  the  ﬁrst  cloned  VSG  genes  provided  probes  to  explore
copy  number,  location  and  diversity  within  trypanosome  genomes,
especially  because  the  3/primeterminal  regions  of  VSG  mRNAs  were
found  to  be  conserved  [20] .  It  was  soon  recognised  that  the  single
expressed  VSG  was  adjacent  to  a  telomere,  or  a  chromosome  dis-
continuity  that  was  subject  to  Bal31  exonuclease  digestion  [21,22]
and  this  strict  association  remains  intact  to  date  (Fig.  1B).  This
stimulated  much  interest  in  telomere  biology  in  trypanosomes,D.  Horn  /  Molecular  &  Biochemical  Parasitology  195  (2014)  123–129  125
which  revealed  the  addition  (and  occasional  large  deletions)  of
TTAGGG/CCCTAA-repeats  to  growing  telomeres  [23–25] ;  the  same
hexameric  repeats  were  later  found  at  human  telomeres.  T.  brucei
telomeres  were  also  found  to  terminate  in  t-loops  [26]  and  this  was
followed  by  the  identiﬁcation  and  characterisation  of  telomerase
reverse  transcriptase,  responsible  for  telomere  growth,  and  other
telomere-repeat-binding  proteins  [27] .
The  VSG -telomere  association  actually  goes  much  further.  Each
T.  brucei  genome  contains  around  250  telomeres,  almost  all  of
which  may  be  closely  linked  to  non-transcribed  VSG  genes,  with
their  3/prime-ends  closest  to  the  telomere.  Around  80%  of  these  telomeres
reside  on  50–100  kbp  long  minichromosomes  [22,28,29] ,  which
appear  to  be  entirely  dedicated  to  VSG  archiving.  Another  ten
or  so  telomeres  reside  on  ‘intermediate’  chromosomes  and  the
remaining  44  reside  on  the  eleven  pairs  of  megabase-chromosomes
that  comprise  the  diploid  genome.  With  many  additional  arrays
of  subtelomeric  VSGs ,  it  is  currently  thought  that  up  to  30%  of  an
African  trypanosome genome is  dedicated  to  archiving  up  to  2000
VSG  genes  and  gene-fragments.
Although the size  of  the  VSG  archive  and  the  telomeric  envi-
ronment  continue  to  present  challenges  for  complete  genome
assembly and functional  analyses,  important  insights  into  VSG  gene
evolution  and  diversiﬁcation  have  emerged  from  genome  sequenc-
ing [30] and  the  cloning  and  sequencing  of  large  intact  telomeric
fragments  [31] .  Extensive  hemizygous  subtelomeric  domains  on
the  megabase  chromosomes  are  dedicated  to  arrays  of  archival  VSGs
[32] ,  meaning  that  many  VSGs  are  present  as  a  single  copy  even  in
a  diploid  genome.  Most  of  these  VSGs  are  pseudogenes  in  T.  brucei
(749/804  analysed)  and  these  VSGs  are  ﬂanked  by  70-bp  repeats
(Fig.  1B)  upstream  [33]  and  highly  conserved  elements  within  the
3/prime-untranslated  region  (3/prime-UTR);  both  of  these  sequences  facilitate
recombination  (see  below).  The  3/prime-UTR  is  also  involved  in  speciﬁc
stabilisation  of  the  VSG  mRNA  at  the  bloodstream  stage,  contribut-
ing  to  a  half-life  of  4.5  h  [34] .
5.  VSG  gene  expression  –  trans -splicing  and  polycistronic
Pol  I  transcription
The  ‘yeast  to  human’  view  of  eukaryotic  diversity  is  very  narrow
so  it  is  not  surprising  that  several  dogmas  have  been  overturned
by  work  on  the  divergent  trypanosomes.  Studies  on  VSGs  revealed
some  unusual  features  underlying  gene-expression  in  trypanoso-
matids  for  example  (Fig.  1B).  S1  nuclease  protection  and  RNA
blotting  experiments  revealed  a  spliced  segment  at  the  5/primeend  of  the
VSG  mRNA  and  reverse  transcription  then  showed  this  “mini-exon”
or  “spliced  leader”  sequence  to  be  35  nt  long  [35] .  Intriguingly,  the
same  sequence  was  found  at  the  5/prime-end  of  two  other  VSG  mRNAs
[36] .  Cis-splicing  was  initially  considered  to  be  the  most  likely
explanation  but  it  turned  out  that  this  same  sequence  was  present
on  all  mRNAs.  In  fact,  discontinuous  mRNA  synthesis  through
bimolecular  splicing  or  trans -splicing  allows  mature  mRNA  to  be
derived  from  precursor  RNAs  transcribed  from  two  different  chro-
mosomes  [37] .  Trans -splicing  was  also  found  to  operate  in  other
trypanosomatids  [38]  and  in  nematodes.
The  search  for  a  VSG  gene  promoter  extended  further  from  the
gene  itself  than  expected.  In  most  eukaryotes,  each  gene  has  its  own
promoter,  while  polycistrons  are  largely  restricted  to  prokaryotes.
Cloning  and  mapping  upstream  of  an  active  VSG  revealed  a  large
expanse  of  imperfect  70-bp  repeats  [39]  and  then  an  Expression
Site  Associated  Gene  or  ESAG  [40]  and  then  several  more  ESAGs
[41] forming  a  polycistron.  It  was  found  that  /H9251-amanitin  failed
to  inhibit  ribosomal  RNA  (rRNA )  transcription,  as  expected,  but
also  VSG  transcription  [42]  implicating  RNA  Pol  I.  These  ﬁndings
prompted a  detailed  analysis  of  RNA  pol  I  and  associated  factors  in
T.  brucei  (see  below).  Polycistronic  transcription  was  also  found  tooperate  within  Pol  II  transcription  units  elsewhere  in  the  genome
[43]  and  this  has  proven  to  be  a  pervasive  feature  of  trypanoso-
matid  genomes.  As  for  the  VSG  expression  site  promoter,  the  ﬁrst
one  was  eventually  found  around  60  kbp  from  the  VSG  [44]  and  was
indeed,  following  mounting  evidence,  conﬁrmed  to  recruit  RNA  Pol
I  in  vitro  [45] .  Nuclear  ‘run-on’  assays  combined  with  inhibition
of  transcription  elongation  using  UV  exposure  were  instrumental
in  locating  the  VSG  expression  site  promoter  [46] ,  the  sequence
of  which  was  unrelated  to  the  more  conventional  rDNA  promoter
[47] .  The  metacyclic  promoters  responsible  for  VSG  transcription
in  the  tsetse-ﬂy  salivary  gland  were  also  found  to  recruit  RNA  Pol  I
but  were  distinct  from  the  bloodstream  promoters  and  in  this  case
were  located  only  a  short  distance  upstream  of  the  telomeric  VSGs
[48] ;  these  are  among  only  a  few  monocistronic  transcription  units
in  trypanosomatids.
The  result  of  all  this  work  revealed  a  somewhat  surprising  sit-
uation  whereby  RNA  Pol  I  and  RNA  Pol  II  are  required  to  produce
mature  VSG expression site  transcripts;  transcription  of  the  spliced
leader  sequence  was  conﬁrmed  to  be  RNA  Pol  II  dependent  [49] .
Further surprises were  in  store  as  assessment  of  other  potential  Pol
II  promoters  in  T.  brucei  or  in  other  trypanosomatids  failed  to  yield
any further conventional  examples.  Rather,  around  sixty  RNA  Pol
II  ‘transcription  initiation  sites’  appear  to  depend  upon  a  partic-
ular chromatin structure  [50]  that  is  not  readily  reconstituted  on
reporter  constructs.
Fifteen  copies  of  the  highly  conserved  subtelomeric  VSG  expres-
sion  sites  active  in  the  bloodstream  have  now  been  identiﬁed,
cloned  by  recombination  in  yeast  and  sequenced  from  the  most
widely  studies  T.  brucei  strain  [31] .  Present  on  the  diploid  and
intermediate-chromosomes,  these  contain  intact  promoters  and
are  competent  transcription  units  but  are  typically  reversibly
repressed  due  to  monoallelic  VSG  expression  control.  Many  ESAGs
found  within  these  polycistronic  units  remain  to  be  characterised
but  the  evidence  so  far  points  to  roles  in  host-parasite  interactions.
For  example,  a  novel  heterodimeric  transferrin  receptor,  encoded
by  ESAG6  and  ESAG7  and  related  to  the  N-terminal  domain  of  the
VSG,  has  the  capacity  to  bind  transferrin  from  different  hosts  with
different  afﬁnities  [51] .  A  human  serum  resistance  associated  gene,
or  SRA,  found  in  T.  brucei  rhodesiense ,  also  resembles  a  VSG  and  is  also
an ESAG  [52]  while  another  gene  resembling  a  VSG ,  known  as  TgsGP ,
confers  human-serum  resistance  to  T.  brucei  gambiense  [53] .  ESAG4
genes  are  unrelated  to  VSG s,  but  also  mediate  host-parasite  interac-
tions.  These  genes  encode  adenylate  cyclases  which  are  released  by
lysed  trypanosomes  and  inhibit  the  innate  immune  response  [54] .
Clearly,  VSGs  and  their  associated  genes  have  been  central  to  the
‘arms-race’  operating  and  evolving  at  the  host-parasite  interface.
The  vast  reservoir  available  has  allowed  VSG  genes  to  be  co-opted
to  functions  beyond  classical  antigenic  variation.  The  relationships
among  these  proteins  could  equally  reﬂect  an  evolutionary  origin
of  VSGs  from  ancient  surface  receptors.
6. Antigenic  variation  by  VSG  gene  rearrangement
Subtelomeres  are  recombinogenic  hotspots,  plastic  regions  of
genomes  enriched  in  gene  families  that  are  most  commonly
involved  in  adaptation  to  different  environments.  Like  many  other
cell  types,  African  trypanosomes  appear  to  have  exploited  these
properties,  in  this  case  for  the  massive  expansion  and  evolution  of
the  VSG  family  and  also  for  the  ESAGs  [55] .  Antigenic  variation  in  T.
brucei  involves  switching  to  expression  of  a  distinct  VSG  so  the  avail-
ability  of  VSG  cDNA  clones  allowed  researchers  to  look  for  changes
associated  with  the  activation  and  inactivation  of  those  VSGs .  Early
analyses  using  Southern  blotting  [56,57] ,  northern  blotting  [58] ,
DNAse I  digestion  [59]  or  DNA  sequencing  [60]  revealed  switch-
ing  by  duplicative  transposition  of  a  non-telomeric  ‘basic  copy’126  D.  Horn  /  Molecular  &  Biochemical  Parasitology  195  (2014)  123–129
Fig.  2.  DNA  recombination  is  central  to  VSG  switching.  The  active  subtelomeric  VSG
locus
 is  prone  to  spontaneous  DNA  breaks.  Three  classes  of  repair  templates  are
shown
 with  VSGs  represented  as  coloured  boxes;  those  sharing  more  (ﬂanking)
homology
 with  the  active  site  are  used  more  frequently  (grey  arrows).  The  homolo-
gous
 sequences indicated are the 70-bp  repeats  (blue  stripes), the telomeric  repeats
(black stripes), the  VSG  3/prime-UTRs  (thick  black  bars)  and  a  portion  of  the  VSG  coding
sequence (red).  A  break  in  or  around  the  active  VSG  is  followed  by  DNA  resection
extending
 towards  the  70-bp  repeats,  often  initiating  recombination  in  this  region.
VSG and  replacement of the  old  VSG  by  the  new  ‘expression-linked
copy’ at  a  single  transcribed  locus.  Silent  telomeric  VSG  cassettes
appeared to be copied  all  the  way  to  the  end  of  the  chromosome
[61,62] by  a  mechanism  now  known  as  ‘break-induced  replication’
(BIR).
Subsequent  analyses  revealed  a  range  of  variations  on  the
recombination theme and DNA  homology  emerged  as  the  key
driver of  these  VSG  rearrangements  [63]  stimulating  further  stud-
ies on a  range  of  T.  brucei  DNA-repair  factors.  Most  VSGs  are  ﬂanked
upstream  by  common  70-bp  repeats  and  even  non-telomeric  genes
share sequences at  the  3/prime-end  [64] ,  sometimes  within  the  region
encoding  the  VSG  C-terminal  domain  and  almost  always  in  the
conserved  VSG  3/prime-UTR  (Fig.  2).  Replacement  of  larger  parts  of  the
expression  site  or  non-duplicative  telomere  exchange  [65]  can
bring  about  a  switch  but  these  events  appear  to  be  relatively
rare  and  even  actively  suppressed  [66] .  Translocation  to  the  active
site  is  preferentially  initiated  by  the  long  tracts  of  70-bp  repeats
found  upstream  of  the  active  VSG  [67,68]  so  the  probability  of
being  ‘selected’  as  a  template  for  repair  depends  upon  these  and
other  sequences  shared  with  the  active  VSG  locus  [69] .  Indeed,
70-bp  repeat  recombination  is  primarily  responsible  for  the  high-
efﬁciency  duplication  of  telomeric  VSGs  [61,62] ,  which  can  employ
the BIR  mechanism,  while  chromosome-internal  VSGs  must  use
a  ‘gene-conversion’  mechanism,  similar  to  BIR  but  with  a  second
recombination  junction,  most  often  within  the  VSG  3/prime-UTR  [39,70] .
Conversion  of  even  shorter  VSG  segments  can  generate  ‘mosaic’
VSGs  that,  because  of  their  lower-frequency  emergence,  become
increasingly  important  for  parasite  persistence  in  a  chronic  infec-
tion  [64,71–73] ,  as  immunity  to  more-frequently  activated  VSGs
builds  [67] .
This  understanding  of  the  shared  sequences  that  drive  recom-
bination  can  now  explain  why  the  expression  of  VSGs  is
‘semi-ordered’  or  somewhat  predictable.  Any  order  though  will
be  isolate-dependent,  less  predictable  as  the  infection  progresses
and  will  ultimately  be  highly  dynamic  and  variable  in  different
infections  and  also  from  one  epidemic  to  the  next,  meaning  that
herd-immunity  is  unlikely  to  be  achieved.  The  potential  VSG  reper-
toire  is  ultimately  larger  than  a  single  genomic  repertoire  due  to
segmental  gene  conversion  and  inter-strain  mating  in  the  tsetse  ﬂy
[74] .  This  genome  plasticity  also  impacts  the  VSGs  expressed  in  the
tsetse  ﬂy  salivary  gland  and  presents  stark  challenges  in  terms  of
any  vaccine  strategy  that  targets  VSGs.
VSG  recombination  does  not  appear  to  be  naturally  triggered
by  a  site-speciﬁc  nuclease  but  rather  appears  to  depend  upon  the
inherent  instability  of  subtelomeres  [75,76] .  Breaks  were  shown  to
arise  naturally  at  telomeric  VSG  loci,  probably  due  to  replication
fork  collapse,  and  an  artiﬁcial,  meganuclease-induced  DNA  break
at the  active  site  can  trigger  a  switch  [75,77] .  These  breaks  initiate
DNA  resection  producing  ssDNA  and  triggering  a  homology  search.Once  a  suitable  template  is  found,  DNA  can  be  copied  from  the  tem-
plate  to  repair  the  lesion  [76] .  Non-homologous  DNA  repair  does
not  appear  to  operate  in  T.  brucei ,  placing  an  emphasis  on  RAD51-
dependent  homologous  recombination  [63,78] .  This  has  had  a
major  impact  on  our  ability  to  manipulate  the  T.  brucei  genome
and  also  makes  an  important  contribution  to  VSG  gene  rearrange-
ments.  There  is  an  alternative  form  of  microhomology-mediated
end-joining,  however.  This  end-joining  is  RAD51-independent  and
may  be  particularly  effective  within  70-bp  repeats,  thereby  making
a  substantial  contribution  to  the  duplicative  transposition  of  VSG s
[76] .
Nuclear  positioning  and  the  chromatin  environment  of  VSG s
may  be  important  for  VSG  recombination  [77] .  In  the  bloodstream
form,  telomeres  [79] ,  active  [80]  and  silent  VSG  expression  sites
[81]  are  distributed  throughout  the  nuclear  space  rather  than
sequestered  at  the  periphery  and  this  may  facilitate  homology
searching  during  DNA  repair.  Notably,  the  active  VSG  expression
site  speciﬁcally migrates to  the  nuclear  periphery  during  differen-
tiation  to  the  insect  stage  [82] .
Switching occurs in  only  approximately  0.001%  of  cells  per  cell
division  cycle  in  experimental  in  vitro  culture  or  during  frequent
syringe passage but  appears  to  be  much  higher  naturally;  switch
rate  returns  to  >0.2%  following  transmission  through  ﬂies  [83]
and also apparently  increases  during  growth  in  vivo  in  mammals
[68,84] .  This  transition  is  not  understood  but  could  involve  the
acquisition  of  a  hyper-labile  or  hyper-recombinogenic  state  at  the
active  VSG  locus  [85] .  Rapid  switching  also  operates  in  metacyclic
cells  obtained  from  tsetse-ﬂy  salivary  glands  [86]  but  in  this  case,
switching  does  not  involve  recombination  [87] .
The  vast  and  dynamic  VSG  gene  family,  the  large  number  of
subtelomeres  in  T.  brucei  and  the  incomplete  sequence  coverage
currently  available  for  these  regions  presents  challenges  but  cur-
rent  techniques  should  now  allow  some  longstanding  questions
to  be  addressed.  For  example,  where  in  the  genome  are  often
entirely  pseudogene-derived  mosaic- VSGs  assembled  and  presum-
ably  selected  for?  Do  non-templated  VSG  mutations  [88]  naturally
contribute  to  immune  evasion?  Are  novel  VSGs  typically  preserved
or  permanently  lost  once  successfully  used  for  immune  evasion?  In
terms  of  this  last  question,  the  presence  of  intact  VSGs  on  minichro-
mosomes [29]  could  reﬂect  an  effective  archiving  mechanism  for
novel  VSGs .  It  will  also  be  of  interest  to  determine  whether  VSG
recombination  requires  or  exploits  dedicated  or  speciﬁcally  mod-
iﬁed  DNA  repair  factors,  such  as  BRCA2  with  an  expanded  set  of
RAD51-interacting  repeats  [89] .
7.  Antigenic  variation  by  VSG  transcription  (in)activation  –
allelic  exclusion
Studies  on  T.  brucei  clones  with  switched  VSGs  also  revealed
that  some  switching  events  were  not  associated  with  duplicative
VSG  transposition  [90] .  Pulsed-ﬁeld  gel-electrophoresis,  combined
with  Southern  blotting,  which  had  also  facilitated  ‘mapping’  of
the  VSG  rearrangements  described  above,  provided  conﬁrmation
of  coordinated  on  and  off  switching,  known  as  ‘in  situ’  switch-
ing  [28] .  This  showed  that  certain  telomeric  VSGs  were  reversibly
active  or  repressed  and  could  be  subject  to  transcriptional  switch-
ing  as  well  as  recombination  [61,91] .  The  in  situ  switches  are
classical  epigenetic  switches  since  they  occur  without  changes  in
the  DNA  sequence  [44] .  Thus,  although  gene  expression  control  in
trypanosomatids  is  primarily  post-transcriptional,  VSG  exclusion
represents  a  prominent  exception  (Fig.  3).  Although  simultaneous
expression  of  two  VSGs  from  distinct  telomeric  sites  has  been
reported  in  T.  equiperdum  [92] ,  VSG  double-expressors  arose  rarely
and were  unstable  in  T.  brucei  [93] .  Thus,  VSG  allelic  exclusion  is
generally  strictly  maintained.D.  Horn  /  Molecular  &  Biochemical  Parasitology  195  (2014)  123–129  127
Fig.  3.  VSG  allelic  exclusion  is  not  yet  understood.  (A)  Only  one  of  the  telomeric  VSGs
(red
 and  green)  is  active  and  only  in  the  mammalian  stages.  This  associates  with  a
focus
 of  extranucleolar  RNA  Pol  I  and  other  factors  (light  blue)  and  produces  the  VSG
coat
 (outer red box). The ‘+’ and ‘x’  symbols  indicate  the  active  and  silent  telomeres,
respectively. (B)  Transcription  can  occasionally  switch  from  one  telomeric  VSG  to
another;
 a coordinated  epigenetic  switch  maintains  allelic  exclusion.  The  dashed
arrow indicates  transcription.  Other  details  as  in  A.
The  mechanism  that  distinguishes  among  almost  identical  VSG
expression  sites in the bloodstream form suppresses  both  tran-
scription
 initiation  [94]  and  elongation  [95]  and  this  results  in  a
remarkable 10,000-fold abundance differential among  active  and
silent VSG  mRNAs  [96] .  Despite  the  distinct  sequences  of  rDNA  pro-
moters,  these promoters, inserted at  VSG  expression  sites,  adopt  the
transcriptional status  of  that  site  [97,98] .  A  second  VSG  inserted
at an active  VSG  expression  site  is  similarly  also  active  [99,100] .
In  contrast  to  this  locus-speciﬁc  control  in  the  bloodstream  form,
it  seems  that  VSG  promoter-speciﬁc  elements,  distinct  from  rDNA
promoters,  allow  selective  down-regulation  of  all  VSG  transcription
during  differentiation  to  the  insect-stage  [101] .
A  novel  DNA  base,  the  hydroxylated  and  glucosylated  derivative
of  thymidine  or  base-J  [102] ,  was  ﬁrst  discovered  at  silent  VSG  loci.
Evidence  of  J-base  came  from  blocked  cleavage  by  certain  restric-
tion  enzymes  such  as  PstI  as  revealed  on  Southern-blots.  Base-J  is
notably  absent  from  insect-stage  T.  brucei  but,  although  implicated
for many  years,  no  role  in  antigenic  variation  has  been  demon-
strated  [103] .  What  is  established  is  that  J-base  is  required  for  RNA
Pol  II  transcription  termination  in  L.  major  [104]  so  it  remains  possi-
ble  that  J-base  also  presents  a  barrier  to  certain  RNA  polymerases  or
DNA  polymerases  in  T.  brucei ,  potentially  impacting  transcription
or  DNA  recombination  and  repair,  respectively.
Transcription  of  the  single  active  VSG  by  RNA  Pol  I,  rather  than
RNA  Pol  II,  suggested  a  potential  ‘privileged  domain’  model  for  acti-
vation  based  on  association  with  the  nucleolus.  As  it  turned  out,
active  VSG  transcripts  and  the  active  VSG  locus  were  found  to  be
extranucleolar  [81] .  Like  the  nucleolus  though,  this  region,  known
as  the  expression-site  body,  is  associated  with  an  accumulation  of
RNA  Pol  I  [80] ,  a  trypanosomatid-speciﬁc  transcription  initiation
complex  known  as  class  I  transcription  factor  A  [105]  and  also  a  pol
I-associated  high-mobility  group  factor  [106] .
It  remains  likely  that  the  telomeric  environment  is  important
for  VSG  allelic  exclusion  as  well  as  for  VSG  recombination.  There  is
evidence  of  a  role  for  the  telomere-binding  protein,  RAP1,  in  VSG
silencing  [96]  and  this  silencing  is  also  dependent  upon  chromatin
structure  [107,108] ;  since  this  topic  is  covered  in  a  recent  review
[77] it  is  not  covered  in  any  detail  here.  Brieﬂy,  the  histones,  histone
chaperones,  chromatin  remodelers,  chromatin  modiﬁers,  cohesins
and  nuclear  lamina,  as  well  as  other  chromatin-associated  factors,
contribute  to  repression.  DOT1B  in  particular,  has  a  major  role  in
establishing  the  silent  state  during  in  situ  switching  [109] .  Thus,
transcription is  clearly  repressed  or  attenuated  at  telomeric  VSG
loci.  Understanding  allelic  exclusion  will  remain  challenging  untilwe  know  more  about  the  selection  of  a  single  VSG  for  expression
and  how  this  is  coordinated  with  the  silencing  of  all  other  VSGs .
8.  Concluding  remarks
The abundance  of  the  active  VSG,  quite  stable  yet  reversible
VSG  repression  and  the  ease  of  genetic  manipulation  and  cell  cul-
ture  mean  that  T.  brucei  provides  a  highly  tractable  experimental
system  for  the  study  of  monoallelic  expression  and  antigenic  vari-
ation.  There  has  been  tremendous  progress  in  our  understanding
in  this  area,  how  the  VSGs  are  organised  and  expressed  and  how
expression is  switched,  through  recombination  in  particular.  An
ancient  and  ongoing  ‘arms  race’  between  host  immunity  and  para-
site  immune  evasion  has  been  illuminated  through  studies  on  VSGs.
The  set  of  monocistronic  VSGs  ﬁrst  expressed  in  the  tsetse-ﬂy  sali-
vary  gland  facilitates  the  establishment  of  a  mammalian  infection
following  a  blood-meal.  The  multiplicity  of  telomeric  VSGs  with
alternative  collections  of  ESAGs  may  then  provide  an  opportunity
to  select  the  optimal  expression  site  for  effective  nutrition  and
growth  in  distinct  host  environments  [51] .  Recombination  can  then
allow  for  VSG  switching  compatible  with  continued  expression  of
a  favoured  set  of  ESAGs .  The  vast  reservoir  of  VSG  genes  allows  the
presentation  of  constantly  changing  epitopes  at  the  cell  surface  to
counter  the  hosts’  capacity  for  adaptive  immunity.
Access  to  genome  sequence  data  changed  the  research  land-
scape,  allowing  easy  access  to  a  vast  number  of  VSG  sequences,
factors  involved  in  transcription,  telomere-binding,  recombina-
tion  and  repair  and  chromatin-based  control.  There  has  been  an
inevitable  focus  on  factors  related  to  those  with  known  functions
in  other  eukaryotes,  however,  meaning  that  a  lot  of  territory  still
remains uncharted  in  trypanosomatid  research.  Recent  technical
advances  in  areas  such  as  forward  genetics  [110] ,  proteomics  [111] ,
improved  access  to  T.  brucei  developmental  stages  in  in  vitro  cul-
ture  [112]  and  new  and  improved  technologies  to  come,  will  surely
now  help  to  deliver  answers  to  some  of  the  outstanding  questions.
