Abstract
Objective The prevalence of the non-convulsive type of late seizure after stroke is unknown. The aim of the
present study was to clarify the characteristics of late seizure in clinical practice, mainly focusing on the
prevalence of non-convulsive seizure.Methods A total of 178 consecutive patients who were admitted and diagnosed with late seizure after
stroke were retrospectively enrolled, and the data of 127 patients for whom the complete seizure was ob-
served by a bystander were analyzed. Clinical informatio n was obtained from the medical records and nursing
notes.Results A non-convulsive seizure was observed in 37 patients (29%). A focal seizure and its secondary gen-
eralization accounted for 79% of the seizure types. Stat us epilepticus was observed in 60 patients (47%), in-
cluding 11 patients (9%) without convulsion. The patie nts with non-convulsive seizures were significantly
younger than those with convulsive seizures, but there were no other significant differences between the twogroups with respect to sex, classification or the lesion of stroke.Conclusion There was a high rate of non-convulsive seizures in patients with late seizure after stroke. A
non-convulsive seizure may be caused by any type or lo cation of preceding stroke. More attention is needed
in the differential diagnosis of neurological deterioration after stroke.

Introduction
In stroke patients, seizures may occur at any time from
the acute phase to years after the stroke. Due to the hugenumbers of stroke patients, stroke is the most commoncause of seizures in the elderly population (1). Louis et al.classified the seizure into two groups according to the timeof the onset of the first seizure: early seizure (within thefirst two weeks after the stroke) and late seizure (onset sub-sequent to the second week) (2). Late seizure occurs in ap-proximately 5% of stroke patients (3-5); the recurrence rate
in patients with post-stroke epilepsy is 2-3% (4, 5). Late sei-zure is not difficult to diagnose when bystanders, such asemergency department staff, primary care doctors, the pa-tient’s family, and even the patients themselves, witness thecomplete typical clinical course, which is characterized byhemi-convulsion on the paralyzed side followed by distur-bance of consciousness and a generalized convulsion. How-ever, some seizures are not associated with convulsive clini-cal symptoms. In such cases, the differential diagnosis isdifficult because physicians must also to consider other pos-

Nevertheless, the prevalence of non-convulsive seizures in patients with late seizures remains un-known. The aim of the present study was to clarify themanifestations of late seizures in clinical practice, focusingon the prevalence of non-convulsive seizures.
Materials and Methods
A total of 178 consecutive patients who were diagnosed
with late seizure after stroke and who were admitted to theDepartment of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Stroke Medi-cine of Yokohama Sakae Kyosai Hospital between January2003 and November 2013 were retrospectively enrolled inthis study. For the purpose of ensuring the accuracy of theseizure type, the data of 127 (71%) patients for whom thecomplete clinical course of the seizure (from its onset tocessation) was observed by a bystander were analyzed. Lateseizures were defined as seizures that occurred more than 2weeks after the primary stroke. Status epilepticus was de-fined as a seizure that repeated frequently enough to pro-duce a fixed and enduring neurological condition lasting forat least 30 minutes. The patients’ clinical information, in-cluding the classification, the lesion of stroke and seizuresymptoms observed during the clinical course, was obtainedfrom the medical records and nursing notes. The diagnosisof late seizure and status epilepticus for each patient wasmade comprehensively with reference to clinical informationsuch as the clinical course (including witness reports fromof multidisciplinary hospital staff members and family mem-bers) the response to antiepileptic drugs, the results of elec-troencephalography (EEG), laboratory tests, and imagingstudies, including computed tomography, magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI), and single photon emission computedtomography. Through these procedures, a careful differentialdiagnosis that excluded other neurological disorders, includ-ing TIA, was retrospectively made.
Results
The patients’ demographic and clinical data are summa-
rized in Table 1. Nineteen patients (15%) had subarachnoidhemorrhage, 34 (27%) had intr acerebral hemorrhage, and 74
(58%) had cerebral infarction. The lesion was most often lo-cated in the frontal lobe (40%).
The interval between stroke and seizure was 151±210
days. Regarding the clinical manifestations of the seizureson arrival, convulsion was observed in 90 patients (71%),but was not observed in 37 (29%). Lateralizing signs suchas hemi-convulsion, hemiparesis, and aphasia were observedin 100 patients (79%); the seizure types included focal sei-zure (n=73; 57%) and secondary generalization (n=27 pa-tients; 21%). The remaining 27 patients (21%) did not haveany lateralizing signs and were classified as having a gener-alized seizure. Status epilepticus was observed in 60 patients(47%), including 11 patients (9%) without a convulsion.
The results of a univariate analysis of the background
characteristics of patients with non-convulsive seizures andthose with convulsive seizures are shown in Table 1. Patientswithout convulsions were significantly younger, but therewere no other significant differences between the twogroups with respect to the sex classification, the lesion ofstroke, or the interval between stroke and seizure.
Next, the symptoms of 37 patients with non-convulsive
seizures were analyzed. The results are shown in Table 2.The symptoms of the patients i ncluded: disturbance of con-Intern Med 56: 627-630, 2017 DOI: 10.2169/internalmedicine.56.7162

Discussion
In the present study, late seizure after stroke was compre-
hensively diagnosed after the intensive investigation of hos-pitalized patients according to their clinical course, clinicaltests, imaging findings, and response to therapy. In particu-lar, information was carefu lly collected from witnesses, in-
cluding the patients themselves, their family, and healthcareworkers, such as the ambulance crew and hospital staff. Thecomplete clinical course of the seizure including the onset,subsequent development, and the cessation of symptoms waswitnessed for 127 patients (71%). These patients were theprime focus of this study because the information about thepresence or absence of convulsions was especially impor-tant. In 29% of the analyzed cases, the presence of convul-sions was not confirmed; this rate was unexpectedly high.
The seizure type was determined based on the clinical
course and symptoms. Focal seizures and their secondarygeneralization accounted for 79% of the seizures, which isin line with the results of previous reports (4, 5, 7). In prin-ciple, a late seizure should be a focal seizure, because itoriginates in a focal stroke lesion. Nevertheless, 21% of pa-tients showed generalized seizures without any lateralizingsigns. In contrast to previous reports, which showed a fre-quency of 9-20% (5, 7, 8), almost half of the patients in thepresent study had status epilepticus. This discrepancy maybe due to differences in the background characteristics ofthe recruited patients, because the present subjects were ex-clusively inpatients. The high frequency of status epilepticuswithout convulsion (9% of all patients) is particularly note-worthy.
Next, the symptoms of 37 patients with non-convulsive
seizures were analyzed (Table 2). The most frequent symp-tom was disturbance of consciousness followed by hemi-paresis and aphasia. In particular, paresis due to seizure hasbeen reported as non-convulsive seizure paralysis (9), focalinhibitory seizure (10), inhibitory motor seizure (11, 12), ic-tal paresis (13), or focal akinetic seizure (14), and languageabnormality due to seizures is also known as ictal apha-sia (15). These seizures should be adequately differentiatedfrom the recurrence of stroke or TIA when patients with a
past history of stroke present to the emergency department.
An EEG is essential and useful for this purpose, but in
many emergency departments it will not always be available.Moreover, the prevalence of specific findings in relation tothe seizures, i.e. epileptiform discharges among patients withpost-stroke seizure is low (5) and epileptiform discharges arealso found among post-stroke patients without seizure (16).Thus, the usefulness of EEG is limited in post-stroke pa-tients with suspected seizures (16). In addition, althoughvideo-EEG is the most reliable tool for accurately evaluatingthe complete clinical course of the seizure and the convul-sive or non-convulsive state (17), most patients with late sei-zure are transferred to emergency departments rather thanepilepsy centers. The difficulties in the diagnosis of non-convulsive late seizure in the emergency department whereEEG or video-EEG is unavailable prompted us to explorethe characteristic clinical backgrounds, including the classifi-cation and lesion of stroke, suggesting the diagnosis of non-convulsive seizure. The only background difference observedbetween the convulsive and non-convulsive groups was theyounger age of the non-convulsive group; however, the rea-sons for this result are unclear. No other significant differ-ences were observed in the characteristics of the two groups,including such as sex, stroke classification, and lesion ofstroke, or the interval between the stroke and the patient’sseizure. It is therefore necessary to be aware that at any timeafter stroke, any type and location of stroke may cause anon-convulsive late seizure. As we recently reported (18),the demonstration of increased cortical perfusion by arterialspin-labeling MRI, which does not require a contrast agent,might be helpful in the early diagnosis of late seizures inthe emergency department.
Conclusion
Non-convulsive seizure occurred in 29% or our cases,
which was an unexpectedly high rate, and was associatedwith status epilepticus in 9% of 127 consecutive patientswith late seizure after stroke. The results of the presentstudy demonstrated that any type or location of precedingstroke may cause a non-convulsive seizure. We should there-fore pay more attention to this type of seizure in the face ofacute neurological deficits such as disturbance of conscious-ness, hemiparesis, and aphasia in post-stroke patients.
