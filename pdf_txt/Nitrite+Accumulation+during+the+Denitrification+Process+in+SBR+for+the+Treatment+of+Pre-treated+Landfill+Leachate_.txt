Abstract The denitriﬁcation performance of a lab-
scale anoxic rotating biological contactor (RBC) using
landﬁll leachate with high nitrate concentration was
evaluated. Under a carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of 2,the reactor achieved N-NO
3-removal efﬁciencies
above 95% for concentrations up to 100 mg
N-NO 3-l-1. The highest observed denitriﬁcation rate
was 55 mg N-NO 3-l-1h-1( 1 5gN - N O 3-m-2d-1)
at a nitrate concentration of 560 mg N-NO 3-l-1.
Although the reactor has revealed a very good perfor-
mance in terms of denitriﬁcation, efﬂuent chemical
oxygen demand (COD) concentrations were stillhigh for direct discharge. The results obtained in a
subsequent experiment at constant nitrate concentration
(220 mg N-NO
3-l-1) and lower C/N ratios (1.2 and
1.5) evidenced that the organic matter present in the
leachate was non-biodegradable. A phosphorus con-
centration of 10 mg P-PO 43-l-1promoted autotrophic
denitriﬁcation, revealing the importance of phosphorus
concentration on biological denitriﬁcation processes.

PhosphorusIntroduction
The generation of leachate remains an inevitable
consequence of the practice of waste disposal insanitary landﬁlls (Wang et al. 2010 ). Landﬁll leachate
may contain a high concentration of organic matter
such as volatile fatty acids, humic and fulvic com-
pounds; inorganic contaminants such as ammonium,
sulphate and chloride; heavy metals and xenobioticorganic substances (Wang et al. 2010 ; Xu et al. 2010 ).
The nitrogen compounds that exist in the landﬁll
leachate can be removed by a variety of processes ofwhich biological nitrogen removal has been widely
adopted.
For instance, Chen et al. ( 2008 ) used a moving-bed
bioﬁlm reactor (MBBR) system with an anaerobic
and aerobic arrangement for simultaneous removal of
COD and ammonium from landﬁll leachate. As longas the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the aerobic
MBBR was more than 1.25 days, over 97% of the
total N-NH
4?removal efﬁciency could be achieved.
Kulikowska et al. ( 2010 ) studied the nitriﬁcation of a
landﬁll leachate in a rotating biological contactor
(RBC) and at an ammonium load of 6.63 g N-NH
4?m-2day-1a nitriﬁcation efﬁciency of 71.6%
was obtained. After pre-treatment of a landﬁll
leachate, Hasar et al. ( 2009 ) applied an aerobic and
anoxic membrane bioreactor and observed COD and
total inorganic nitrogen (sum of nitrate, nitrite and
ammonium) removals above 90 and 92%, respec-tively, at a sludge retention time of 30 days.S. Cortez /C1P. Teixeira /C1R. Oliveira ( &)/C1M. Mota

provided by Universidade do Minho: RepositoriUMLeachates with high nitrogen-ammonium content
may be difﬁcult to treat by conventional biological
treatment processes (Cema et al. 2007 ). Therefore,
there has been a great need to improve existing
technologies and to ﬁnd new solutions concerning
nitrogen removal. As an example, in the treatment ofa landﬁll leachate, Cema et al. ( 2007 ) investigated an
anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) process
along with autotrophic nitriﬁcation and heterotrophicdenitriﬁcation in one RBC and found that this system
was able to completely remove the total inorganic
nitrogen. Wang et al. ( 2010 ) and Xu et al. ( 2010 ) also
applied systems with the integration of partial
nitriﬁcation, Anammox and heterotrophic denitriﬁca-
tion processes in sequencing batch reactors with verygood performances in organic matter and nitrogen
removal. Some drawbacks of these processes are that
they might be very complex to operate and it maytake months to achieve its full operation. New
solutions should continue, therefore, to be developed.
In Portugal, in many cases, after withstanding a
series of oxidation processes in the treatment plant at
the sanitary landﬁll, the leachate still presents a high
nitrate concentration.
Bioﬁlm systems offer some advantages compared
to the suspended growth systems, such as higher
resistance to toxic agents and a lower sensitivity tolow temperatures. They provide good removal efﬁ-
ciencies, even with efﬂuents with the low 5-day
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD
5) to chemical
oxygen demand (COD) ratio (BOD 5/COD) com-
monly found in many leachates (Ga ´lvez et al. 2009 ).
Bioﬁlm technology has been shown to be aneconomic and effective method to degrade nitrate
(Moreno et al. 2005 ). The availability and type of
organic carbon compounds and the oxidation/reduc-tion state of wastewater determine, to a large extent,
the occurrence of nitrate reduction (van Rijn et al.
2006 ). Microbial growth and composition and mic-
robiota type in the bioﬁlm are also signiﬁcant factors
that affect the efﬂuent quality and the application of a
bioﬁlm technology for water and wastewater treat-
ment (Lazarova and Manem 1995 ). In turn, microbial
growth is regulated by many factors, being theavailability of phosphorus one of the most important
(Teixeira and Oliveira 2000 ).
In this study, an anoxic RBC consisting of a series
of closely spaced discs mounted on a common
horizontal shaft, completely submerged in theleachate to be treated and inserted in a tightly closed
case to avoid air entrance was used. This type of
reactor was chosen because it is simple to operatewith low operating and maintenance costs, high
biomass concentration, high speciﬁc surface area,
short hydraulic retention time (HRT) and relativelysmall accumulation of sloughed bioﬁlm.
The aim of the present work was to evaluate the
performance of an anoxic lab-scale RBC in terms ofdenitriﬁcation of a landﬁll leachate with high nitrate
concentration. Accordingly, the effect of initial
nitrate concentration on the reactor performancewas assessed, as well as the effect of phosphorus
concentration and C/N ratio.
Materials and methods
Experimental lab-scale reactor
The single-stage anoxic RBC consisted of 8 poly-
methylmethacrylate (PMMA) discs mounted on a
rotating shaft. The total surface area was equal to
0.218 m
2for 8 discs. The scheme of the experimental
reactor is shown in Fig. 1and its design character-
istics are listed in Table 1. The discs were completely
immersed. The anoxic RBC was covered and sealedand no special precaution was taken to maintain
anoxic conditions. The temperature was kept at 28 /C176C
by means of a heating jacket. Substrate was fed by aperistaltic pump at a constant hydraulic retention time
(HRT) of 10 h and a ﬂow rate of 0.25 l h
-1. The
treated efﬂuent was collected in a receiving tank.Flow through discs was parallel to the rotating shaft.

rate of produced gas.
Inoculum
A volume of concentrated biological sludge was
collected from an activated sludge tank at Esposende
Wastewater Treatment Plant, Portugal. In order towork with a suitable consortium, in the two exper-
iments, the fresh biomass was acclimatised for
1 month in a denitrifying medium, under anoxicconditions, at room temperature, in conical ﬂasks
stirred at 150 rpm, using acetate as carbon source and
a phosphorus concentration of 10 mg P-PO
43-l-1.
The denitrifying medium composition was 1134.0 or
850.6 mg CH 3COONa /C13H2Ol-1according to the
former or the latter experiment, respectively,721.8 mg KNO
3l-1, 60.9 mg K 2HPO 4/C13H2Ol-1,
9.0 mg KH 2PO4l-1and 100 ml of trace elemental
solution, which contained: 242 mg Na 2MoO 4/C12H2O,
56 mg FeSO 4/C17H2O, 8.1 mg MnCl 2/C12H2O, 390 mg
CaCl 2/C12H2O and 409.2 mg MgSO 4/C17H2O per litre of
tap water. Due to the medium buffering capacity, nopH adjustment was performed.
Landﬁll leachate characteristicsLandﬁll leachate was collected from a municipal
landﬁll in the North of Portugal, in operation since1998, after having been treated in the treatment plant
existing in the sanitary landﬁll, which comprisesstabilisation and anaerobic ponds, an anoxic tank,
aerated ponds and a biological decantation unit,
together with an oxidation tank and two chemical
precipitators. The collected leachate was stored inclosed containers at 4 /C176C until use. The characteristics
of the undiluted leachate used in the experiments are
summarised in Table 2.
From Table 2it can be seen that the major
problem associated with the already treated leachate
is its extremely high nitrogen-nitrate concentration.
Experimental procedure
The study consisted of two experiments. In both of
them, for bioﬁlm development, the lab-scale reactor
was inoculated with acclimatised sludge and wasoperated in batch mode for 5 days. After that time,
the anoxic RBC mixed liquor was removed, the
reactor was re-ﬁlled with fresh substrate and startedto operate in a continuous mode. The hydraulic
retention time, very high at the beginning, was
gradually reduced during 8 days. The time ‘‘zero’’ ofoperation was set 2 days after having the HRT
stabilised at 10 h, when samples started to be
collected.
Throughout the study, considering the low carbon
content of the leachate tested and since acetate is
known to give the highest denitriﬁcation rates (Tamet al. 1992 ; Elefsiniotis and Wareham 2007 ), sodium
acetate was added as supplementary carbon source.
The amount of sodium acetate needed to attain thedesired C/N was calculated taking into account the
total organic carbon present in the landﬁll leachate.
The ﬁrst experiment—Experiment 1—was
designed to evaluate the effect of initial nitrate
concentration on reactor performance and lasted for
26 days. Nitrate inﬂuent concentration was graduallyTable 1 Summary of the characteristics of the anoxic RBC

123increased (by reducing leachate dilution), while all
other operating parameters were kept constant, as
listed in Table 3. At the beginning of the experiment
the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater, having
a composition similar to the denitrifying medium
described below.
Another experiment—Experiment 2—followed
Experiment 1 to evaluate the inﬂuence of carbon to
nitrogen ratio (C/N) and phosphorus concentration ondenitriﬁcation (Table 4). Experiment 2 was per-
formed using a ﬁve-fold diluted landﬁll leachate
and lasted for 42 days. The required phosphorusconcentration was achieved adding to the inﬂuent a
calculated amount of KH
2PO4.
Process monitoring
During the course of operation, samples of the RBC
inﬂuent and efﬂuent were regularly collected and
analysed for pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD),
nitrogen-nitrate (N-NO 3-), nitrogen-nitrite (N-NO 2-),
nitrogen-ammonium (N-NH 4?) and carbon-acetate
(C-CH 3COO-). pH values were immediately mea-
sured after the collection of the sample with a pHmeter. COD, nitrogen-nitrite, and nitrogen-ammo-
nium were determined according to the standardmethods (APHA et al. 1989 ). Nitrate and acetate
concentrations were measured by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), using a VarianMetacarb column (type 67H, 9 lm, 300 mm long,
6.5 mm internal diameter) and a mobile phase of
0.005 M sulphuric acid (H
2SO4) at 0.7 ml min-1.
Column temperature was set at 60 /C176C and nitrate and
acetate were detected by UV at 210 nm. Periodically,
gas samples were analysed by a gas chromatograph(GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector
and a Porapak Q column (2 mm internal diameter,
80–100 lm mesh, 1 m length) in series with a
Molecular Sieve column (2 mm internal diameter,
5A˚, 80–100 lm mesh, 2 m length). Helium was used
as the carrier gas at a ﬂow rate of 17 ml min
-1.
Temperatures of the injector port, columns and
detector were 110, 35 and 110 /C176C, respectively. Total
organic carbon (TOC) analyses were performed usinga Dohrmann DC-190 total organic carbon analyser.
Results and discussion
Effect of inﬂuent nitrate concentrationThe inﬂuence of initial nitrate concentration on
denitriﬁcation efﬁciency was investigated by chang-ing the nitrogen-nitrate concentration (from about
100 to 560 mg N-NO
3-l-1), keeping a C/N ratio of
2. This ratio is slightly higher than the theoreticalvalue of 1.4 obtained considering the approach of
McCarty et al. ( 1969 ) when acetate is the carbon
source, given by the stoichiometric equation:

However, some carbon is used for the removal of
oxygen from the system. Therefore, a conservativeassumption was made to ensure complete denitriﬁ-
cation during the experiment. Fine-tuning of carbon
dosages were investigated in a later experiment.

a very good performance in terms of nitrate removal
when synthetic wastewater was used as inﬂuent. The

123initially a decrease in nitrate removal efﬁciency to
75%. This was certainly a transient response to the
change of inﬂuent, corresponding to bioﬁlm acclima-tisation phase. Nitrate removal efﬁciency recovered
fast and was kept around 99% as on day 10. When the
nitrate concentration was doubled on day 13 and againon day 20, the nitrate reduction remained approxi-
mately constant.
Throughout the experiment, the actual amount of
nitrate removed increased, which indicates that the
denitriﬁcation rate increased with the initial nitrate
concentration. This fact might be explained by theincrease in electron acceptor when the nitrate
concentration increased.
Excluding the bioﬁlm adaptation periods, even for
the greatest inﬂuent nitrate concentration tested,
efﬂuent N-NO
3-concentration was less than or equal
to 10 mg l-1, being below the established limit for
discharge into fresh water (10–30 mg N-NO 3-l-1)
(European Comission 1991 ). Regarding the results
achieved with landﬁll leachate, the denitriﬁcation rateincreased from 13 to 55 mg N-NO
3-l-1h-1
(4–15 g N-NO 3-m-2d-1) when the initial nitrate
increased from 140 to 560 mg N-NO 3-l-1at 28/C176C
with sodium acetate as carbon source. In a previous
study, Calli et al. ( 2005 ) obtained denitriﬁcation rates
in the range 33.3–120.8 mg N-NO x-l-1h-1(N-NO x-
nitrogen from nitrate and nitrite compounds) in the
treatment of a young landﬁll leachate at room
temperature (from 17 to 26 /C176C) with sodium acetate
as carbon source. A denitriﬁcation rate of 55 mg
N-NO 3-l-1h-1was achieved by Welander et al.
(1998 ) in a suspended carrier bioﬁlm reactor, treating
mature leachate at 17 /C176C but using methanol as
external carbon source. The denitriﬁcation rates
obtained in the present work are similar to the valuesreported in the literature. However, it is difﬁcult to
make comparisons due to differences in temperature,
pH, initial N-NO
3-and N-NO 2-concentrations,
carbon sources used, C/N ratio, hydraulic retention
times and phosphorus content, parameters that are
also determinant in the nitrate removal process.
The selected retention time of 10 h was adequate
to assure the nitrate removal performance. Also, theobtained results demonstrate the viability of the
anoxic RBC in the denitriﬁcation of a pre-treated
landﬁll leachate.
Nitrite accumulation during denitriﬁcation of
landﬁll leachates has been observed in many studies(Chen et al. 2009 ; Martienssen and Schops 1997 ; Sun
et al. 2009 ). However, it is very important to avoid
nitrite accumulation because it can lead to inhibitionof bacterial development (Martienssen and Schops
1997 ). Moreover, high nitrite content is highly
undesirable as nitrite is more toxic than nitrate(Welander et al. 1998 ). It can be seen from Fig. 2b
that efﬂuent N-NO
2-was around 3 mg l-1when the
inﬂuent was synthetic wastewater. By changing theinﬂuent to leachate, an increase in nitrogen-nitrite
accumulation was noted followed by a rapid and
signiﬁcant drop. A plausible explanation for thisbehaviour may be related with the activity of the
enzyme nitrite reductase present in the microbial
bioﬁlm community, which is only stimulated when aconsiderable nitrite concentration is produced.

123is the sudden increase of ammonium in the reactor,
which might have inhibited temporarily the growth of
nitrite oxidising bacteria, although followed by arapid recovery (Terada et al. 2003 ). The increase in
nitrate concentration had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence in
nitrite efﬂuent concentration.
Ammonium is also an undesirable compound since
it can be toxic to aquatic microorganisms. As
illustrated in Fig. 2b a signiﬁcant ammonium
removal was observed when landﬁll leachate was
fed to the reactor. This is probably due to ammonium
reduction by nitrite to form gaseous nitrogen. In fact,in the beginning there was some nitrite accumulation
and a low ammonium reduction but when the
ammonium reduction rises to about 50% nitriteaccumulation is almost negligible.
The changes in COD and C-CH
3COO-concen-
trations throughout the experiment are shown inFig. 3a and b, respectively. Until the sixth day ofoperation COD inﬂuent values were only due to the
addition of acetate. From day 6 onwards, these data
correspond to the contribution of added acetate andcarbon content from the landﬁll leachate.
During the ﬁrst experimental period, around 82%
of carbon-acetate was consumed and showed to beenough to assure 99% of nitrogen-nitrate removal.
This implies that the reactor was not carbon limited
and was receiving enough carbon to promote thedenitriﬁcation process. Efﬂuent COD concentration
was approximately 71 mg l
-1. After the shift to
leachate and the corresponding bioﬁlm acclimatisa-tion phase, small variations in COD removal values
were observed until the end of the experiment. The
carbon-acetate removal efﬁciency slightly increasedwith the increasing nitrate concentration. This trend
may be due to the lower amount of acetate fed to the
reactor when leachate was used as inﬂuent, therebyremaining less acetate in the efﬂuent. The carbon
content of the leachate is most probably less degrad-
able than acetate, which might also explain theobserved differences. The efﬂuent COD concentra-
tions reached values greater than 125 mg l
-1, which
is the discharge standard value. Therefore, in order tofulﬁl environmental regulations, for high nitrate
loads, the acetate concentration should be adjusted
and biodegradability studies concerning the landﬁllleachate must be carried out.
pH values increased from 6.4–7.3 in the inﬂuent to
7.8–9.4 in the efﬂuent. The observed pH trend might beattributed to the conversion of N-NO
3-to nitrogen gas
in the reactor, which consumed hydrogen ions. This
effect was more relevant as the inlet nitrate concentra-tion increased. The optimum pH for most environ-
mental strains of denitrifying bacteria was reported
between 7.0 and 8.0 (Tchobanoglous and Burton1991 ). In the present study high nitrate removals were
even possible for pH above 9.0, which leads to the
conclusion that the increased pH was not inhibitory.
The produced gas ﬂow rate, as expected, increased
with the increasing nitrate concentration, in agree-
ment with the nitrogen-nitrate removal efﬁciency
proﬁle (Fig. 4a).
Gas composition was measured at NTP conditions
as a percentage by volume and data are shown in
Fig. 4b. The gas composition remained almost
unchanged with the increasing nitrate concentration.Nitrogen (N
2) was the main compound in the
analysed gas composition (around 90%). Release of708090100

123CO 2was low because it was mainly solubilised in the
medium, promoting an increase in alkalinity. Pro-duction of N
2O was below 0.2% (minimum detection
value). A small concentration of O 2(approximately
0.3%) was detected in the gas composition analyseduntil day 13. It is important to note that biological
denitriﬁcation was considered before to be strictly
anoxic (Payne 1973 ). However, the present results
conﬁrm that, as reported by (Lukow and Diekmann
1997 ), with a certain number of bacteria, denitriﬁca-
tion occurs in the presence of O
2. No methane or
hydrogen sulﬁde gases were detected by the measur-
ing system.
During this experiment, the anoxic RBC presented a
very good denitriﬁcation performance. Almost all
nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas and no nitrite
accumulation was found. The bioﬁlm attached to thediscs was slightly sensitive to variations in substrate,
which is a desirable characteristic when landﬁllleachate with such high nitrogen-nitrate content is
being treated. The main drawback of the system was
the unused carbon remaining in the treated efﬂuentwith increased COD discharge. Therefore, an efﬁcient
acetate dosage strategy is required, which was consid-
ered in the following experiment (Experiment 2).
Effect of C/N ratio and inﬂuent phosphorus
concentration
Dosage of external carbon source is a tricky param-
eter to control in a denitriﬁcation process. A poor C/Nratio leads to incomplete denitriﬁcation resulting in a
signiﬁcant increase in the efﬂuent nitrate concentra-
tion or accumulation of intermediate products, suchas NO
2and N 2O. On the other hand a high C/N ratio
is an extra cost and may promote dissimilatory nitrate
reduction to ammonia and the presence of carbon inthe denitriﬁed efﬂuent (Her and Huang 1995 ).
Therefore, the C/N ratio must be properly controlled.
The nature and concentration of inﬂuent substrates
may affect bioﬁlm growth and composition. Under a
high substrate loading rate, the bioﬁlm accumulation
is higher. The limitation in some nutrients, asphosphorus, may enhance polysaccharide production
instead of cell formation in the bioﬁlm and conse-
quently the concentration of active biomass (Veigaet al. 1992 ).
The inﬂuence of C/N on denitriﬁcation efﬁciency
was investigated by changing the carbon concentra-tion, keeping constant the nitrate concentration
(220 mg N-NO
3-l-1). A range of C/N between
1.45 and 2 is reported in the literature (Mohseni-Bandpi et al. 1999 ; Reyes-Avila et al. 2004 ) for
denitriﬁcation using acetate as carbon source. Based
on the data from the previous trial, this experimentstarted with a C/N ratio almost identical to the ratio
given by the stoichiometric equation: 1.5.
It can be seen in Fig. 5that, under the running
conditions of C/N =1.5 and 0.3 mg P-PO
43-l-1,
the nitrogen-nitrate removal efﬁciency was around
63%. Considering the concentration of N-NO 3-in
the efﬂuent, this removal was relatively low, however
some acetate still remained in the treated leachate(Fig. 6), showing that the reactor was not carbon
limited. After 13 days of operation, the C/N ratio was
adjusted from 1.5 to 1.2, which is below thetheoretical value. The aim of this change in the C/N
ratio was to reduce the concentration of COD in the20002250250027503000e (ml·l-1·h-1)

123efﬂuent and to examine into what extent the organic
matter in the leachate could be used as carbon source
for the denitriﬁcation process. As a consequence,acetate was completely consumed and efﬂuent COD
concentration remained near the reference value
of 125 mg l
-1but N-NO 3-removal efﬁciency
decreased to 48%. Since all acetate was consumed
and efﬂuent COD was not, these results suggest that
the organic matter present in the leachate should benon-biodegradable and the denitrifying bioﬁlm could
not use it. The C/N of 1.2, composed of carbon from
sodium acetate and landﬁll leachate, was insufﬁcientfor the denitriﬁcation process.
Considering that inﬂuent phosphorus concentration
can signiﬁcantly affect the denitrifying process (Alveset al. 2002 ; Teixeira and Oliveira 2000 ), in an attempt
to make the microbial community consume the
leachate organic matter, P-PO
43-inﬂuent concentra-
tion was changed to 10 mg l-1, from day 20 onwards.
Phosphorus concentration was selected according toWelander et al. ( 1998 ). The shift to a higher
phosphorus concentration, keeping C/N =1.2, led
to a moderately increase in nitrogen-nitrate removal
efﬁciency, while no effect was detected on COD
removal efﬁciency. A possible explanation might bethat a high phosphorus concentration led to the growth
of autotrophic denitrifying microorganisms. A higher
activity of autotrophic denitrifying microorganismsusually occurs in environments with low C/N ratios
(Kim and Son 2000 ). Koenig and Liu ( 1996 ) showed
that a decrease in the nitrate concentration wascoupled with an increase in the sulphate concentration
due to autotrophic denitriﬁcation.
Taking into account the positive effect of phos-
phorus concentration on nitrate removal, the high
efﬂuent N-NO
3-concentration and the poor biode-
gradability of the landﬁll leachate, the C/N ratio wasincreased again to 1.5 on day 27 and ﬁnally to 2 on
day 36 keeping on working with 10 mg P-PO
43-l-1.
Nitrogen-nitrate removal efﬁciency notably increased,while small differences in COD and carbon-acetate708090100

123removal values were noted under those conditions.
High C/N ratios with 10 mg P-PO 43-l-1may have
stimulated the growth of autotrophic and heterotro-phic denitrifying bacteria in the bioﬁlm and thus
promoting a higher nitrate removal rate. The C/N ratio
required for complete denitriﬁcation, besides thenature of the carbon source, depends on the nature
of the bacterial species (van Rijn et al. 2006 ).
The results suggest that for a nitrate concentration
of 220 mg N-NO
3-l-1, a better reactor performance
was achieved with C/N =2 and 10 mg P-PO 43-l-1.
At these conditions, the highest denitriﬁcation ratewas 18.5 mg N-NO
3-l-1h-1.
Probably a further increase of the C/N ratio would
have allowed the complete removal of nitrate, asobserved by Alves et al. ( 2002 ). In addition, it may be
possible to optimise the phosphorus concentration in
the range 0.3–10 mg P-PO
43-l-1.
Nitrite accumulation was not observed, even when
the C/N ratio was lower than the stoichiometric value.
The efﬂuent ammonium concentrations were alwayslower than the input values.
pH values increased from 6.4–7.1 in the inﬂuent to
8.6–9.4 in the efﬂuent.
The produced gas ﬂow rate varied following the
proﬁle of nitrogen-nitrate removal efﬁciency (Fig. 7a).
The reactor was operated with approximately 0.4%
of O
2(Fig. 7b). CO 2production remained around
1%. Gas was mainly composed of N 2.N2O accumu-
lation was observed when C/N ratio was 1.2. Honget al. ( 1993 ) reported that a low C/N ratio could result
in N
2O production. N 2O is a potent greenhouse gas
with high ozone depletion potential, therefore, it isimportant to minimise its emission.
The results obtained in this experiment showed
that a limited C/N ratio (less than the theoretical1.4) resulted in an increase of efﬂuent nitrate
concentration and N
2O production. The landﬁll
leachate used was non-biodegradable, rich in refrac-tory compounds and the denitrifying bioﬁlm could
not use its carbon content. Probably, to meet the
maximum allowable organic matter concentration
for discharge, advanced oxidation processes, such as
ozone or Fenton oxidation should be applied beforebiological treatment.
The shift to a higher concentration of phosphorus
seemed to favour the activity of autotrophic denitri-ﬁers and therefore, nitrate removal. This result
emphasises the importance of phosphorusconcentration as well as the composition of the bioﬁlm
community on the denitriﬁcation process. Better
denitriﬁcation conditions were achieved with
C/N =2 and 10 mg P-PO
43-l-1. Considering the
nitrate concentration applied (220 mg N-NO 3-l-1)
and since no nitrite accumulation was detected, the
anoxic RBC showed an efﬁcient performance in termsof denitriﬁcation.
Conclusions
Considering the nitrate concentration applied, nitrate
removal efﬁciencies and the negligible accumulation
of intermediates in both experiments, the anoxic
rotating biological contactor showed to be veryefﬁcient and is a promising technology for removing
nitrate from landﬁll leachate.
In order to improve leachate biological treatability,
future research should focus on the removal and
change of the recalcitrant organic matter by an
advanced oxidation process, which must be appliedbefore the bioﬁlm reactor. Considering the ammonium900100011001200130014001500rate (ml·l-1·h-1)
