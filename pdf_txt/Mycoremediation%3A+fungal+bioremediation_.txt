Index     573xixPREFACE
Scientists began to use fungi and bacteria for the degradation of xenobiotic 
organic compounds toward the middle of the twentieth century. The use of bacteria showed fast and promising results, but research on evaluating fungi has lagged behind. This does not mean that fungi are not suitable organisms or that they function less satisfactorily than bacteria in degrading such com-pounds. The participation of fungi in bioremediation is now well established in all ecosystems.
Mycoremediation is one of the most complex areas in applied remediation 
engineering. During the past two decades, many fungal scientists and engi-neers have wanted to try using fungi in the degradation of organic com-pounds, and for those who did try using them, good results were obtained. The discovery of the value of white-rot fungi in bioremediation has brought greater success and has thus stimulated research throughout the world. A new era in the use of fungal technologies for the degradation of organic com-pounds has begun. Thus, the need has arisen for a book that discusses the unique role of fungi in bioremediation.
The state of the science described here represents pioneer work that focuses 
on the new and exciting ﬁ  eld of mycoremediation. The book contains ele-
ments from all scientiﬁ  c and engineering disciplines known globally and lays 
a strong foundation in the subject that will serve to connect knowledge devel-oped in both the twentieth and twenty-ﬁ  rst centuries. The book is encyclope-
dic in scope and presents various types of fungi and the associated fungal processes used to clean up wastes and wastewaters in contaminated environ-ments. The book covers aspects related to degradative fungi, taxonomy, bio-chemistry, enzymology, reactor engineering, genetic engineering, ecology of xx PREFACE
biodegradation, and practical applications. The knowledge ﬂ  ows broadly from 
fundamental to practical aspects, making it useful to learn and apply biore-mediation holistically. The book contains not only an interwoven synthesis and historical perspective of the technology but also provides “slow-release nutrition” for inventions and new frontiers for future research.
Fungi are one of nature’s most versatile organisms in their structure, 
metabolism, ecology, and genomics. The ﬁ  rst step is to understand fungal 
morphology, analysis and measurement of growth, and processes of fungal biodegradation (Chapter 1). Immunological and molecular assays are deﬁ  ned 
as novel tools for the detection of degradative fungi. Chapters 2 and 3 cover the treatment of a wide variety of industrial wastewaters and brewery and distillery wastes, fermentations, bioreactors, and modeling concomitant with economic importance. Next, the metabolic pathways and mechanisms of mycotransformation and mycodetoxiﬁ  cation of petroleum hydrocarbons 
(Chapter 4), polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins (Chapter 5), and pesti-cides (Chapter 6) are explored. A wide spectrum of bioreactors, mechanisms, and factors affecting mycotransformation, metabolic pathways, and metabo-lites of phenols (Chapter 7), polycyclic aromatic hy drocarbons (Chapter 8), pulp and paper mill efﬂ  uents (Chapter 9), and dyes (Chapter 10) are covered 
next. The role of fungal enzymes in the degradation and transformation of phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, lignin and pulp and paper mill efﬂ uents, and dyes is discussed in detail. Chapter 11 focuses on the properties, 
associated mechanisms, and applications of living and nonliving fungal biomass in metal biosorption. The role of mycorrhizal fungi in the uptake of toxic metals and degradation of xenobiotic organic compounds is also dis-cussed (Chapter 12). Methods to identify, select, and use fungi are discussed holistically associated with mycoremediation applications. The latest advances in genetic engineering and molecular biotechnologies that will be useful for the creation of suitable fungi capable of faster detoxiﬁ  cation of these com-
pounds are also described. However, many problems and limitations still exist and need to be overcome.
The book is intended to reach a wide audience, including managers and 
leaders in research and the practice of mycoremediation and should be very useful as a reference tool for practicing engineers, scientists, waste site manag-ers, and regulatory experts. It will also provide useful information for experts in allied ﬁ  elds, such as botany , mycology , geology , ecology , fungal biochem-
istry, genetics, enzymology, metabolic engineering, environmental microbiol-ogy, and biotechnology. This should be a leading source for graduate and undergraduate students interested in understanding the capacities and pro-cesses of fungal biodegradation. Graduate students can conduct experiments or research in the laboratory or apply fungi in bioremediation at contami-nated sites without seeking special guidance. The work will also serve as a handbook for the creation of new designs and components for mycoremedia-tion processes. Instructors will ﬁ  nd that they can teach a course or course-
related topics directly from the book, and lectures may be prepared in a PREFACE xxi
variety of programs of study, from fundamental background to case studies. 
The nearly 2000 references can serve as a template for any speciﬁ  c subject 
area related to mycoremediation. The book will stimulate thought and greater research in the wider context of mycoremediation processes in the coming decades. Hazardous wastes and wastewaters constitute a problem of modern civilization that will not go away for centuries. New wastes and wastewaters are being generated every year with our growing industrialization. A day will come when fungi will play a greater role in the transformation and detoxiﬁ  ca-
tion of hazardous wastes and wastewaters than at present.
I am highly grateful to Dr. Steven C. McCutcheon for his valuable guidance 
and suggestions during preparation of the book. Special credit goes to my wife, Dr. Julu Bhatnagar, who provided insight in biotechnology and molecu-lar and immunological techniques for the detection of degradative fungi as well as contributing to the design of the cover. Finally, I wish to express my sincere thanks to Mr. Nathan Wilson for allowing me to use his photograph of Trametes versicolor  (from the Web site http://mushroomobserver.org) on

INTRODUCTION
Fungi are a diverse group of organisms and are ubiquitous in the environ-
ment. They have contributed a lot toward shaping human welfare since the beginning of civilization. Their contribution ranges from natural to industrial use. They can exist and survive in almost every habitat. Fungi play vital roles in all ecosystems and are capable of regulating the ﬂ  ow of nutrients and 
energy through their mycelial networks. They affect the environment at the macroscale, although their impact remains largely hidden from the world. Their mycelial networks may cover several hectares of forest ﬂ  oor, and thus 
fungi are considered the natural and true ecosystem engineers (Lawton and Jones, 1995). However, the contributions of the fungi are often neglected by professionals, engineers, scientists, and the general public.
Fungi are believed to have survived for about 5300 years (Haselwandter 
and Ebner, 1994). Armillaria bulbosa  is considered among the largest and 
longest-living organisms in the world (Smith et al., 1992). Fungi are micro-scopic eukaryotic organisms exhibiting growth on various substrates and are capable of continuing their function almost indeﬁ  nitely. These organisms, 
including the molds, yeasts, and ﬁ  lamentous fungi, are unique microorgan-
isms that can be employed in the remediation of wastes and wastewaters. Environmental engineers all over the world have to solve problems of wastes and wastewaters, and many saprophytic ﬁ  lamentous fungi can degrade com-
pounds ﬂ  owing with wastewaters to receiving waters and thus contribute to 
their cleanup. Some molds, yeasts, and fungi are highly tolerant to extremes of hydrogen ion concentration in the substrate and can be found in a very

acidic or highly alkaline environment. Fungi are highly plastic and most 
fungal cells are totipotent, so the entire organism can be regenerated not only from spores but also from hyphal fragments.
1.1 FUNGAL BIODEGRADATION AND BIODETERIORATION
Fungi are known to degrade, or cause to deteriorate, a wide variety of materi-
als and compounds, processes known as mycodegradation  and mycodeterio-
ration . The degradative activities of fungi have been recognized in various 
situations where they destroy different types of wood, stored paper, textiles, plastics, leather, and electroinsulating and various wrapping materials (Table 1.1). Polyethylene, with a molecular weight of 4000 to 28 000, is degraded by the cultivation of Penicillium simplicissimum  YK (Y amada-Onodera et al., 
2001), and bioremediation of polyethylene may be possible in the future. Enzymes of Mucor rouxii NRRL 1835 and Aspergillus ﬂ  avus  have produced 
changes in the mechanical properties and weight of disposable polyethylene bags (El-Shafei et al., 1998). The white-rot fungi are also efﬁ  cient in polyeth-
ylene degradation (Iiyoshi et al., 1997). Aspergillus ﬂ  avus  colonized and 
degraded chitosan-graft polymethyl methacrylate ﬁ  lm by 45% during 25 days 
of aerobic cultivation in a study by Harish Prashanth et al. (2005). Phanero-
chaete chrysosporium attached to ﬁ  bers of polyamide-6 and reduced 50% of 
the polymer’s molar mass after 3 months (Klun et al., 2003). Of 15 species of white- and brown-rot fungi, Resinicium bicolor  was shown to be the most 
effective fungus for the detoxiﬁ  cation of ground waste tire rubber material 
prior to devulcanization (Bredberg et al., 2002).
Fungi also assist in the deterioration of concrete. Species of Fusarium
contribute to a loss of calcium and weight in concrete during exposure (Guet al., 1998). Increase in cement porosity and a loss of bending strength with low leaching of calcium have been attributed to acids produced by Aspergil-
lus niger  and Mycelia sterilia  (Perfettini et al., 1991). Direct contact of fungal 
mycelia with a cement surface is not necessary. Black fungi such as Phoma 
and Alternaria  interact with marble surfaces and cause physical, chemical, 
and aesthetic damage (Diakumaku et al., 1995). Aureobasidium pullulans 
colonizes on plasticized polyvinyl chloride (pPVC) within 25 to 40 weeks of e x p o s u r e  ( W e b b  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 0 ) .  Aureobasidium pullulans  grows on intact 
pPVC formulation as a sole source of carbon, secretes extracellular

tion materials produced from crushed plant parts are highly endangered by the molds.
Fungal biodeterioration of various types of library materials is a problem 
worldwide. In the period 1919–1977, ﬁ  lamentous fungi belonging to 234 
species of 84 genera were isolated from different types of library materials (Zyska, 1997). Twenty-ﬁ  ve years of research investigating stains on paper 
made by fungi, known as foxing , have been described (Arai, 2000). A culture 
of Rhizopus oryzae  converted waste ofﬁ  ce paper to l(+)-lactic acid (Park et 
al., 2004). Fungi also cause decay in wall paintings and deterioration of w o o d e n  a r t i f a c t s .  T h e r e  i s  a  v a s t  l i t e r a t u r e  o n  w o o d  d e c a y  b y  w h i t e -  a n d  brown-rot fungi. Fungi have also been known to attack ancient and medieval glass surfaces. Trichophyton simii  and A. niger  have been shown to cause 
degradation of wool in a liquid culture medium (Shrivastava et al., 1996). Both fungi cause a weight loss in wool and the release of proteins. Some fungal species are also known to invade resins used to glue together the lenses of microscopes and other optical instruments. Fusarium moniliforme  is 
capable of degrading deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to nucleic bases or their derivatives (Kruszewska et al., 2004).
1.2 HOW A FUNGUS ESCAPES WATER TO GROW IN AIR
Filamentous fungi can colonize moist substrates such as wood and breach the 
water–air interface to grow into the air (Wosten et al., 1999). Schizophyllum 
commune  reduces the surface tension of water before escaping the aqueous 
phase to form aerial hyphae or fruiting bodies. Surface tension results from the secretion of large amounts of hydrophobin into the aqueous surroundings that form a stable amphipathic protein ﬁ  lm at the water–air interface. In a 
continuous ﬂ  ow of liquid medium, the hyphae of mycelial fungi, especially of 
A. niger , reorient their direction to grow upstream (Oh et al., 1997).
1.3 FUNGAL MORPHOLOGY, ANALYSIS, 
AND GROWTH MEASUREMENT
1.3.1 Fungal Morphology
The fungal kingdom represents a group of organisms with a great variety of 
structures. The majority of fungi are composed of vegetative structures termed mycelia  that grow from their tips as binary branching trees (Viniegra-
Gonzalez et al., 1993). Mycelia are unique threadlike, tubular structures that form extensive branched and anastomosing systems. Each mycelium is like a forest, where an individual tree is known as a hypha . The hyphae of most 
fungi are septate, but the presence of pores through the septa allows the mass FUNGAL MORPHOLOGY, ANALYSIS, AND GROWTH MEASUREMENT 34 INTRODUCTION
movement of cytoplasm and organelles and the migration of nuclei through 
the mycelium to distant parts. Each hypha starts from a spore that upon ger-mination produces one or several outgrowths called germinal tubes , where 
material is transported toward the apex for growth. Hyphae are bounded by a wall of a rigid heteropolymer matrix called chitin , which is composed of 
glucosamine. A mycelium contains two types of vesicles in the cytoplasm that play an important role in apical growth (Bartnicki-Garcia, 1990). These ves-icles are of different sizes, perform different functions, and are recognized as macrovesicles and microvesicles. Macrovesicles  secrete the polymers and 
enzymes that comprise the amorphous phase of the wall, and microvesicle
components constitute the chitin skeleton of the wall. Components of mac-rovesicles are synthesized internally, whereas the components of microvesicles accumulate at or near a wall–membrane interface. Yeasts are unicellular organisms with a cell wall and a single nucleus per cell. In general, there is considerable variation in the form of yeast cells, but there are two basic types: budding and ﬁ  ssion yeasts.
Filamentous fungi show several distinct morphologies in submerged cul-
tures. Mycelia are freely dispersed or become agglomerated in the medium. Loose hyphal aggregates are referred to as clumps ; denser, often spherical 
aggregates are termed pellets . Hyphae can range from linear ﬁ  laments to 
branched structures. Clumps and pellets vary in size, density, and surface structure, even in the same fungus. Due to their viscous nature, the dispersed mycelial suspensions behave in a non-Newtonian manner. Pellet fungal sus-pensions are less viscous and thus exert less inﬂ  uence on the ﬂ  ow properties 
of a bulk liquid medium. The rheology of fermentation ﬂ  uids is affected by 
two primary factors: biomass concentration and fungal cell morphology. Fungal cell morphology is inﬂ  uenced by the agitation intensity, culture CO
2,
pH, speciﬁ  c growth rate, and O 2.
1.3.2 Analysis of Fungal Morphology
Analysis of fungal morphology depends on accurate measurement of hyphal 
length and branching frequency. A variety of methods are recognized for the analysis of fungal morphology (Table 1.2). Image analysis is one of these methods. A hyphal growth unit (G) has been proposed (Caldwell and Trinci, 1973) to deﬁ  ne the total hyphal length (main hyphae plus branches) divided

 stainingby the number of tips, the sites of hyphal extension. Autoradiographic studies 
have shown the nonviability of the signiﬁ  c an t  p e r ce n t a g e  o f  h yp h al  t i p s  in  
Trichoderma  that does not contribute to growth (Pitt and Bull, 1982). The 
value of G accounts for the number of viable tips. G is calculated on a volume 
basis ( Gvol) if variations in individual hyphal diameters are also noted 
(Robinson and Smith, 1979). Estimation of a precise Gvol value requires the 
use of two magniﬁ  cations to measure hyphal width (Cox et al., 1998).
An automated image analysis program and protocol have been developed 
for the identiﬁ  cation and enumeration of live versus dead cells of Aureobasi-
dium pullulans  on microscopic slides and leaf surfaces (Nelson et al., 2000). 
Live cells take up CellTracker Blue and nonviable DEAD Red, and the Optimas software is used to differentiate viable and dead cells. An automatic method of creating digital images of fungi was employed to evaluate the color distribution, colony dimensions, and texture measurements of seven isolates of Penicillium  (Dorge et al., 2000). A Windows application could locate the 
position and size of up to three colonies in an image. Automated image analy-sis and ﬂ  uorescent staining have also been used to determine the fungal 
biomass in soil and on inert surfaces (Morgan et al., 1991).
Several measurements are used for loose aggregated mycelia (clumps) in 
a dispersed state. In common use is projected area measurement, in which a three-dimensional area of a clump can be captured to a reasonable size. In Aspergillus niger , ratios of the clump perimeter to the core perimeter have 
been used to measure clump shape (Papagianni et al., 1999). The projected clump area correlates well with broth rheology for Penicillium chrysogenum
(Cox et al., 1998). Projected area measurements are also employed for the image analysis of fungal pellets, pellet size, and the shape and dimensions of a protruding hyphal region. However, a measurement related to all morpho-logical forms in fungal fermentations has yet to be developed. In ﬁ  lamentous 
fungi, fractal analysis has been used with some success to study colony growth (Jones et al., 1993; Matsuura and Miyazima, 1993). A standard method to measure fractal dimensions ( D) is unknown, and the D value obtained is 
method dependent (Soddell and Seviour, 1994).
1.3.3 Pellet Formation and Structure
The processes in the formation of pellets in fungi are not fully understood, 
but two different mechanisms, coagulating and noncoagulating pelletization, have been proposed. The formation of coagulating pellets is a two-step process: the aggregation of spores, and subsequent aggregation of germinat-ing spore agglomerates. Noncoagulating pellets result from germination of a single spore. Phanerochaete chrysosporium  appears to involve surface poly-

Pellets may also result from the agglomeration of hyphal aggregates and fragments of previously broken pellets. Factors affecting the formation of pellets are FUNGAL MORPHOLOGY, ANALYSIS, AND GROWTH MEASUREMENT 56 INTRODUCTION
strain speciﬁ  c, and the pellet structure usually depends on the cultivation 
conditions used during the process. The structure of mycelial pellets is vari-able and can range from loose, irregular aggregates to tight, compact spheres. In general, pelleted suspensions of fungal cells are not viscous and deviate from Newtonian behavior at high biomass concentrations.
Several factors are recognized to affect the formation and structure of 
pellets in ﬁ  lamentous fungi (Gibbs et al., 2000): inoculum concentration and 
preparation, agitation intensity, composition of the medium, and others. Medium composition includes the culture pH, carbon level, phosphorus con-centration, surface-active agent, and so on. Some fungi do not form pellets; other fungi in pelleted form exhibit reduction in the production of metabolites caused by nutrient transfer limitations in the cells of pellets. Tightly compact pellets are deﬁ  cient in the free ﬂ  ow of molecular diffusion and are hollow in 
the center, due to autolysis of the mycelium. In Penicillium chrysogenum ,
pellets with a diameter of less than 400 μM contain all active cells. Larger 
pellets exhibit four distinct zones: an outer layer of actively growing cells, two layers of less active cells, and a hollow center. Only the outer 100 to 200 μM layer of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  pellets assimilates glucose 
(Cronenberg et al., 1994). A possible relationship exists between fungal morphology and metabolite production in ﬁ  lamentous fungi.
1.3.4 Growth Measurement
Growth is a complex process with many different component processes. Reg-
ulation of growth is controlled by numerous factors. Fungi require carbon and nitrogen for growth, and some aspects of nutrition have been examined by Singh (1978). Various media have been established for the detection and enumeration of yeasts and molds (Beuchat, 1992). The spread-plate technique is preferred over the pour-plate technique. Methods exist for the measurement of growth in fungi (Table 1.3). Chitin measurement is used to estimate fungal b i o m a s s  in  s o li d -s t a t e  f e rm e n t a t i o n  ( R o c h e  e t  al . ,  1 993 ).  E r g o s t e r o l  i s  al s o  considered to be an indicator of fungal biomass. As ergosterol is subject to signiﬁ  cant photochemical degradation, this test should be employed carefully 
as a biomarker for living fungi (Mille-Lindblom et al., 2004). A simple ana-lytical technique has been developed that enables quantitative determination of fungal growth and decolorizing ability in solid media for white-rot fungi

weight in either stationary or shake cultures in 500-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂ  asks. A 
rapid and efﬁ  cient method has been developed for the measurement of growth 
in ﬁ lamentous fungi (Langvad, 1999). Growth can be measured very efﬁ  -
ciently on a 96-well microtiter plate and microplate reader. Enumeration of fungal propagules by colony-forming units (CFU) is employed routinely for fungal quantiﬁ  cation (Bridge and Spooner, 2001).
An electrochemical method based on cyclic voltammetry shows all four 
phases of Fusarium solani  growth (Subrahmanyam et al., 2000). The growth 
curve obtained matches well with conventional methods of measuring dry weight. The experiments also conﬁ  rm that the anodic peak is due to metabo-
lites, not the fungal biomass. The behavior of living cells of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae  in a voltammetric system with a graphite electrode indicates the 
relationship between the peak current and growth curve during the entire period of fermentation (Ci et al., 1997). The early stages of growth, from germination through hyphal development of ﬁ  lamentous fungi such as Peni-
cillium ,Phoma , and Trichoderma , can be analyzed by ﬂ  ow cytometry 
(Bradner and Nevalainen, 2003).
1.4 MASS TRANSFER, GROWTH KINETICS, 
AND BIOREACTORS
Filamentous fungi are the most important microorganisms for the processing 
of solid substrates. This can be attributed as due to the diverse capabilities and hyphal mode of growth. Finite difference was the ﬁ  rst model to predict 
changes in hyphal length, branching, and septa, based on the cellular mecha-nisms observed (Prosser and Trinci, 1979). Since then, several models have been proposed to elucidate hyphal growth by apical enlargement and branch-ing. These models have been divided into two categories and described by Nielsen (1992). In general, cell models are based on the cellular mechanisms observed, and population models consider a number of intracellular compo-nents and reactions. A range of modeling approaches is applied to vegetative growth in fungi. These include empirical, mechanistic, deterministic, and stochastic models.

apical growth and hyphal morphogenesis qualitatively. Two main parameters are used: the rate of increase in area equal to the number of vesicles released by the vesicle-supplied center (VSC) per unit time, and the rate of linear displacement of the VSC. Georgiou and Shuler (1986) considered diffusion of the substrate and biomass in the colony in terms of vegetative, competent, conidiophore, and conidial species. Model simulation suggested the prolifera-tion of differentiating structures due to mass transfer limitations. Aynsley MASS TRANSFER, GROWTH KINETICS, AND BIOREACTORS 78 INTRODUCTION
et al. (1990) developed a kinetic model for the growth of mycelial fungi in a 
submerged culture. Nutrients are absorbed uniformly, transformed into wall precursors, and transported to the growth tip, where they are utilized in the p r o c e s s  o f  e x t e n s i o n .  N o  m a s s  t r a n s f e r  l i m i t a t i o n  i s  a s s u m e d  h e r e  a n d  t h e  precursor is transformed at a constant rate via Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Mitchell et al. (1991) proposed a semimechanistic model for the growth of Rhizopus oligosporus , secreting glucoamylase on a solid medium where it 
diffuses during the hydrolysis of starch and the release of glucose. Glucose absorbed by the mycelium is transformed into biomass via Monod kinetics. A mathematical model has been developed for apical growth, septation, and branching of mycelial fungi (Yang et al., 1992). The model is based on the diffusion and production of wall precursors to describe tip growth and septa-tion (deterministic) and for the branching (stochastic) processes. Morphologi-cal development of mycelia up to the formation of pellets correlates well with experimental ﬁ  ndings.
A mechanistic model has been derived that considers mass transfer and 
hyphal growth in ﬁ  lamentous fungi before branching (Lopez-Isunza et al., 
1997). The model considers the substrate diffusion in a solid medium, uptake, and release of substrate at the wall by a carrier, and formation of wall precur-sors to mass transport by diffusion and convection inside the hyphae. Good qualitative correlations have been shown between model simulations for a range of substrate concentration with the experimental data when measured values of hyphal diameter and the maximum germ tube length are considered. Cui et al. (1998) presented a mathematical model of fungal growth and mor-phology in submerged fermentations. This model accounts for oxygen trans-fer, agitation intensity, dissolved oxygen tension, pellet size formation of mycelia, the fraction of mycelia in the total biomass, carbohydrate source consumption, and biomass growth. Comparison of simulation with experi-mental data indicates that the model can describe well the period of fungal growth and morphology. Variations in hyphal tensile strength with time have been considered that can lead to improvement in the morphology models (Li et al., 2002). A mathematical model has been developed that relates the properties of a fungal mycelium at the microscopic level to growth and func-tion at the macroscale (Boswell et al., 2003). The model is based on movement of the hyphal tips and the translocation of internal substrate. The model equa-tions are of mixed hyperbolic–parabolic type and it is important that the mass be conserved and maintained. The model is calibrated for Fusarium solani
growing on a glucose–mineral salts medium and solved in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.
A model has been constructed to explain the colony patterning and col-
lective hyphal growth of ﬁ  lamentous fungi (Matsuura, 2002). The model 
considers two external parameters, such as the initial nutrient level and the step length of a nutrient random walk, and one internal parameter, such as the frequency of nutrient uptake. The model colony shows the onset of dis-ordered ramiﬁ  cations at low nutrient levels, with reduced nutrient uptake frequency under diffuse conditions. During the growth of Aspergillus nidu-
lans, the rate of hyphal extension is reduced, due to a population effect when 
hyphae produce three-dimensional dense colonies. The colony periphery becomes thick, due to a population effect as the nutrient diffusion effect is increased at high nutrient levels with a low rate of hyphal growth. The pattern of colony and onset of disorder are propelled by a combination of nutrient diffusion and rate of hyphal growth.
Certain fungal bioreactors have been used for the removal of several pol-
lutants (Table 1.4). Fungal bioreactors are also termed mycoreactors . Myco-
reactors are of two types: (1) bioﬁ  lm or immobilized systems and (2) suspended 
growth. Mycoreactors based on attached growth include trickling ﬁ  lters, 
rotating biological contactors, upﬂ  ow ﬁ  xed-ﬁ  lm reactors, and ﬂ  uidized-bed 
reactors, and those based on suspended growth include slurry reactors, among others. Different mycoreactors are operated under aerobic or anaerobic con-ditions. In mycoreactors, the operation can be batch, semibatch, sequencing batch, or continuous. Stirred tanks are the most common mycoreactors for submerged growth. However, under certain conditions, other reactor types, such as packed bed, bubble column, and airlift tower loops, are also used. Several fungi are used in immobilized form in various reactors to facilitate rapid biodegradation. Pellet-forming fungi are cultivated in aerated ﬂ  uidized-
bed or suspended airlift loop reactors. Several physical, chemical, and biologi-cal parameters affecting the bioprocess are important in the monitoring and control of performance and of bioreactors and in their improvement. A math-ematical process modeling involving various assumptions can be used to predict the efﬁ  ciency of contaminant removal from bioreactors. The meta-
bolic and genetic diversity of fungi in bioreactors can be analyzed by obtain-ing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁ  cation of DNA. The use of 
ultrasonic ﬁ  eld-based ﬁ  lters has been assessed for the enhanced separation 
of ﬁ lamentous fungi and its use in repeated-batch processes (Crognale et al., 
2002). The operating conditions were optimized, and three batch processes revealed 88% of a system’s separation efﬁ  ciency.
During the past decade, knowledge-based control systems have been used

1.5 METHODS FOR DETECTION OF DEGRADATIVE FUNGI
Fungi are important in the functioning of a soil ecosystem, especially the 
decomposition processes of organic matter. Unfortunately, little is known as to the population structure, dynamics, and diversity of fungi in soil. Some methods are designed to detect viable decay fungi, and others detect residual nonviable fungal metabolites. Direct cultivation methods are employed for assessment of the prevalence of microorganisms in soil, but fungal growth on agar plates may not present an accurate picture of the in situ structure and diversity of fungal communities. Moreover, mycorrhizal fungi are reluctant to grow on agar plates. It is also difﬁ  cult to make inferences about in situ 
fungal numbers based on observations from plates. Thus, it is necessary to develop novel methods to study the in situ behavior of fungi in processes related to ecology, decomposition, and bioremediation. Methods selected for the detection of degradative fungi have been described by Jellison and Jasa-lavich (2000).
1.5.1 Immunological Assays
Immunological assays have been used for the detection of fungi in culture 
and the detection of decay fungi in wood since the mid-1980s (Table 1.5). Monoclonal antibodies to Postia placenta  using extracellular culture ﬁ  ltrates 
were ﬁ  rst produced in 1986 (Jellison and Goodell, 1986). Monoclonal anti-
bodies to detect fungal metabolites such as manganese peroxidase (MnP) in wood by Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Daniel et al., 1991) and polyclonal 
antibodies for laccase by Lentinus (Lentinula )edodes (Goodell et al., 1998) 
were subsequently recognized. Clausen (1997) reviewed the diversity of immunological techniques from 1986 to the present and their application to wood decay fungi. These techniques include immunological probes, immunoﬂ  uorescence, immunoblotting, agglutination assay, enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), modiﬁ  ed ELISA, dipstick assa y , and chro-
matographic assay.

antibodies against a number of brown-rot and stain fungi using immunologi-cal probes (Clausen, 1997). Monoclonal antibodies to both whole-cell myce-lial extracts and extracellular antigen extracts of Serpula lacrymans  have 
been produced (Glancy and Palfreyman, 1993). Immunoﬂ  uorescence has 
been studied as a sensitive and quantitative analysis for the detection of Basidiomycetes in wood. Dot-immunoblot assay on nitrocellulose paper with polyclonal antibodies to the brown-rot fungus Lentinus (Lentinula )lepideus
was ﬁ  rst reported by Glancy et al. (1989), and this assay can be a preliminary 
test for detecting brown-rot decay (Clausen et al., 1990). Western blot is used to differentiate isolates of Serpula lacrymans  from other wood decay basid-
iomycete fungi (Viagrow et al., 1991). Agglutination assay, considered to be the most rapid immunodiagnostic technique, is a good ﬁ  eld test for brown-rot 
decay (Clausen et al., 1991). ELISA assays have been employed for the quan-titative detection of Ophiostoma  sp. C28 within wood using polyclonal anti-
body (Breuil et al., 1990). Modiﬁ  ed ELISA has also been utilized on wood 
for the detection of Ophiostoma  sp. C28. Strong ELISA reactions have been 
obtained in copper chromated arsenate– and ammoniac copper–treated wood infected by Phialophora mutabilis  using polyclonal antibodies (Daniel and 
Nilsson, 1990). A dipstick immunoassay has been developed for the detection of Phytophthora cinnamomi  in soils (Cahill and Hardham, 1994). An indirect 
immunoﬂ  uorescence test has been developed to detect 10 propagules/ml of 
Hormoconis resinae  i n  a vi a t i o n  k e r o s i n e  i n  5  h o u r s  ( Lo p e s  a n d  G a y l a r d e ,  
1996). ELISA has also been discussed for the quantitative estimation of fungal biomass during solid-state fermentation (Dubey et al., 1998).
1.5.2 Molecular Assays
Recently, molecular strategies for the detection of fate and diversity of fungi 
in soils have been developed. These methods can identify fungi on a species level and are based on the use of variable internally transcribed spacer regions. A PCR has been used to amplify rDNA sequences selectively to determine the total fungal diversity and taxonomy using universal primers (White et al., 1990). Speciﬁ  c primers can be designed to amplify and analyze fungal DNA 
from cultures. Table 1.6 shows available molecular assays for the detection of degradative fungi in various media.

The 18S ribosomal RNA sequence as a phylogenetic marker to distinguish 
different fungal species is less developed than the 16S rRNA sequence in bacteria. About 114 rRNA sequences of four major divisions of fungi were known up to 1995 (van de Peer and De Wachter, 1995), but this number has now increased to 500. Fungal-speciﬁ  c primer pairs EF4f/EF3r and EF4f/
Fung5r can be used to amplify a wide range of fungi of the major groups (Smit et al., 1999). Proﬁ  les of fungal communities in soil have been assessed 
via fungal-speciﬁ  c PCR, followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
( van Elsas et al., 2000). Of four primer pairs, the primer pair EF4f/Fung5r produced amplicons with the DNA of a wide range of fungi. The phylogenetic position of a variety of fungal species has been investigated. Fungal diversity from microbial communities can be assessed by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA terminal restriction fragment (TRF) pattern analysis (Lord et al., 2002). Borneman and Hartin (2000) reported on two newly developed primer pairs to amplify rDNA from all major classes of fungi in soil. Detec-tion and quantiﬁ  cation of fungal DNA from soil substrate involve speciﬁ  c 
primers targeting a 362-base pair (bp) fragment from the SSU rRNA gene region of Glomus intraradices  and a 562-bp fragment from the Fusarium 
solani  f.sp. phaseoli  translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene in real-time 
PCR conjugated with the ﬂ  uorescent SYBR Green I dye (Filion et al., 2003). 
New speciﬁ  c primers AR1 and AR2 are used to amplify a speciﬁ  c part of the 
ITS region of rDNA of Armillaria isolated from soil samples (Lochman et 
al., 2004). The ITS region is ampliﬁ  ed by nested PCR with external primers 
ITS1 and ITS4 and internal primers AR1 and AR2. Species of Armillaria
are differentiated by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) with the restriction endonuclease HinfI.
A protocol has been developed for the direct extraction of fungal DNA 
from soil (Nazar et al., 1996). The fungal DNA extraction method (FDM), modiﬁ  ed from the protocol of Nazar et al. (1996) and proposed by van Elsas 
et al. (2000), is efﬁ  cient in lysing fungal spores or mycelia. In addition, several 
methods are known to prepare ampliﬁ  able DNA for PCR from fungal conidia. 
Three methods for DNA extraction from fungal conidia and yeast cells in air, water, and dust samples have been evaluated for use in real-time PCR (TaqMan) analyses (Haugland et al., 2002). A simple bead milling method has been developed for accurate estimation of these organisms in air and water (tap and surface) samples. A total of 120 fungal strains were tested by multiplex PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-AGE) or micro-chip electrophoresis (PCR-ME) (Fujita et al., 2001). The internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and ITS2 regions and 5.8S rDNA region were ampliﬁ  ed using 
universal primers ITS1 and ITS4. The ITS2 region was ampliﬁ  ed simultane-
ously using universal primers ITS3 and ITS4. Isolates of the dry-rot fungus Serpula lacrymans  were detected by the PCR of the internal transcribed 
spacer region (ITS1, 5.8S rDNA, ITS2) using universal primers ITS1 and ITS4 coupled with restriction digestion of the resulting product to produce restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) (Schmidt and Moreth, 1998). RFLP analysis of PCR-ampliﬁ  ed rDNA has also been used to charac-
terize tropical wood-decaying fungi (Zaremski et al., 1998). Jasalavich et al.(2000) ampliﬁ  ed the internal transcribed spacer regions of both Ascomycetes 
and Basidiomycetes from pure culture and inoculated spruce wood using universal primer ITS4 and primer pair ITS1-F, speciﬁ  c for higher fungi. TaqI 
RFLP proﬁ  les clearly separate several species of Basidiomycetes and subspe-
cies of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and Scytinostroma galactinum . Isolates 
of Trametes versicolor  can be distinguished at the species level by a AluI 
RFLP proﬁ  le and TaqI RFLP proﬁ  les and at the subspecies level by HaeIII 
RFLP proﬁ  les. The basidiomycete-speciﬁ  c primer system in conjunction with 
RFLP analysis of the ampliﬁ  ed product is both selective and speciﬁ  c in 
detecting white- and brown-rot fungi and is a potential tool for the study of fungal colonization and wood degradation.
In situ hybridization can assist in the rapid and accurate identiﬁ  cation of 
ﬁ lamentous fungi in histologic tissue sections (Hayden et al., 2002). In this 
study, DNA probes are directed against the 5S or 18S ribosomal RNA sequences of these fungi. Rapid and efﬁ  cient extraction of fungal DNA from 
small quantities of tissue in a batch-processing format has been examined (Grifﬁ  n et al., 2002). This assay involves scraping of tissue, a boiling step, and 
use of the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Tissue Kit protocol to purify the DNA for PCR/sequencing. Ultraviolet (UV) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ioniza-tion (MALDI) time-of-ﬁ  ght (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) has been used 
for the rapid identiﬁ  cation and characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Amiri-Eliasi and Fenselau, 2001).
1.6 FUNGI AS ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS
In the past decade, the use of fungi as bioindicators in air, soil, and water 
pollution surveys has been recognized. However, fungal species are unable to map pollution. Of four fungi, Thelephora caryophyllea  accumulates metals 
in the soil (Maurice and Lagerkvist, 2000). It is possible to use an arsenic test with fungi from a preliminary assessment point of view. Lycoperdon perlatum
may be employed as a bioindicator of heavy metals and selenium in soil pol-lution (Quinche, 1990). The mycological quality of the sand beaches of Lisboa and Vale do Tejo, Portugal, indicates that Scopulariopsis  and Candida  can 
be used as speciﬁ  c environmental indicator organisms of sand beach quality 
(Mendes et al., 1998). 
137Cs/134Cs activities have been measured in about 250 
soil samples and 350 samples of fungal species in a forest in Bavaria, Germany, and this ratio has been found to be an indicator of major mycelium locations in forest soil (Ruhm et al., 1997). Two approaches, static and dynamic, have advantages in estimating the mycelium location of fungi.
Yeasts are used in various tests for the determination of mutagenic or 
carcinogenic action. Due to limited permeability, yeast cells exhibit lower sensitivity to mutagens or carcinogens than do bacteria. The general perme-FUNGI AS ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS 1314 INTRODUCTION
ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  cells can be enhanced by mutation, and 
on this basis, a more sensitive test (D7ts1) has been developed to study envi-r o n m e n t a l  p o l l u t i o n  ( T e r z i y s k a  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 0 ) .  T h i s  t e s t  m e a s u r e s  p o s i t i v e  samples of soil, air, and water and detects mutagenic or carcinogenic activi-ties. The new D7ts1 test has proved better than the yeast D7 test of Zimmer-man. All samples with a positive bacterial Ames test are positive in the new D7ts1 test. However, some samples positive in D7ts1 tests are negative in the Ames test. Simultaneous use of the D7ts1 and Ames tests is beneﬁ  cial, as it 
detects dangers for activities related to human health where bacterial cells do not respond.
Recent advances in knowledge of multicolored ﬂ  uorescent proteins from 
yeasts and fungi have opened a door regarding the sensing systems used for environmental pollutants. Whole cells of these organisms can be incorporated into different array formats on silicon chips, optic ﬁ  bers, and other conﬁ  gura-
tions. Baronian (2004) discussed the use of the whole cells of yeast and ﬁ  la-
mentous fungi as sensing elements in biosensors.
1.7 FUNGAL ATTACK ON COAL
The role of fungi in the transformation of coal has been recognized for a 
decade or so. Of more than 750 fungal strains, only six strains have been shown to modify the physicochemical properties of pieces of hard coal (Hofrichter, 1998). The attack by Coprinus sclerotigenis  C-142-1 of powdered 
hard coal releases 2-hydroxybiphenyl, alkylated benzenes, and polycyclic aro-matic hydrocarbons. Fusarium oxysporum  and Trichoderma atroviride  are 
a b l e  t o  s o l u b i l i z e  l o w - r a n k  c o a l  ( L R C )  ( M o n k e m a n n  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 7 ) .  S t r o n g  evidence exists for the existence of components of a ligninolytic system comparable to Phanerochaete chrysosporium .T. atroviride  secretes a partly 
inducible heat-sensitive agent that has hydrolytic properties and assists in the solubilization of Rhenish lignite (Holker et al., 1999a). This mold also appears to produce an unusual esterase for the cleavage of ester bonds in the presence of lignite (Holker et al., 1999b). Moreover, T. atroviride  produces alkaline 
substances and chelators that assist in the dissolution of coal humic materials. Trichoderma  sp. M2 and Penicillium  sp. are new molds that tend to modify 
and solubilize hard coal without the formation of tarlike products (Laborda et al., 1997, 1999). An indigenous culture of Aspergillus  sp. eliminated 70 to 
80% of total sulfur from high-sulfur coal from the coal ﬁ  elds of Assam in 
India (Acharya et al., 2005).
Bioconversion of brown coal occurs by a process of solubilization which is 
typical for molds, yeasts, actinomycetes, and pseudomonad bacteria, and depolymerization is limited to ligninolytic Basidiomycetes (wood-decaying and litter-decomposing fungi). Hofrichter and Fakoussa (2001) listed various groups of fungi that show solubilizing and depolymerizing activities toward brown coal or utilize it as a growth substrate. Wood-rotting fungi and their oxidases are found to solubilize, polymerize, depolymerize, and decolorize 
macromolecules derived from low-rank coal (LRC) (Ralph and Catcheside, 1997). Phanerochaete chrysosporium  depolymerizes, and decolorizes 
alkali-soluble acid-precipitate LRC macromolecules (AS coal) to a form unre-coverable by alkali washing. Nitrogen-limited media with hyperbaric oxygen enhance the transformation of AS coal. This appears to be due in part to oxidation by manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP); however, their precise role is yet unclear.
Ligninolytic Basidiomycetes produces three enzymes—lignin peroxidase, 
manganese peroxidase, and laccase—that appear to be involved in the depo-lymerization of coal. The basidiomycete strain RBS 1k produces MnP, and the strain RBS 1b secretes oxidative enzymes with laccase and peroxidase activity before the onset of coal solubilization (Willmann and Fakoussa, 1997). The cell-free peroxidase of RBS 1k or laccase of RBS 1b in vitro is unable to promote water solubility of low-rank coals. MnP from Clitocybula 
dusenii  catalyzes and optimizes the depolymerization of coal humic sub-
stances (Ziegenhagen and Hofrichter, 1998). The South American white-rot fungus Nematoloma frowardii  b19 and four other fungi have been shown to 
depolymerize low-rank-coal–derived humic acids, releasing fulvic acid–like compounds (Hofrichter and Fritsche, 1997). Nematoloma frowardii  and other 
fungi produce high levels of laccase mRNA in the presence of coal humic substances in the medium (Scheel et al., 1999a, b).
1.8 THERMOPHILIC, ALPINE, AND LICHEN-FORMING FUNGI
The majority of fungi are mesophilic and grow in the temperature range 5 to 
35ºC, with optimum growth between 25 and 35ºC. Some fungi are psychro-philic and are capable of growth near or below 0ºC. Certain psychrotolerant fungi can survive at the very low temperature of −40ºC. True psychrophiles 
include some species of Mucor  and yeasts. Thirty-two cold-adapted, psychro-
philic, cold-tolerant yeast strains from alpine habitats have been character-ized related to taxonomy, growth temperature proﬁ  les, and their potential 
to degrade phenol and phenol-related compounds (Bergauer et al., 2005). Thermophilic fungi can grow above 40ºC and are widespread in terrestrial habitats. Thermophilic fungi can be cultivated in minimal media with growth yields and metabolic rates comparable to those of mesophilic fungi. It appears that these organisms can grow in heavy metal concentrations, variable pH, or extremes of environmental conditions. Heat-tolerant fungi are known for their ability to decompose plant polymers and their potential in compost-ing. These fungi are useful in bioconversions, where they can reduce the requirement for cooling during growth. Some extracellular enzymes are produced by thermophilic fungi and are of good scientiﬁ  c and commercial 
interest (Maheshwari et al., 2000). Unlike white-rot fungi, enzymes of thermophilic fungi are to be discovered that can be used in mycoremediation. THERMOPHILIC, ALPINE, AND LICHEN-FORMING FUNGI 1516 INTRODUCTION
The occurrence of heat-resistant fungi has been revealed in soil samples from 
the Slovak Republic (Jesenska et al., 1992). Several heat-resistant species of fungi have been isolated and identiﬁ  ed. Xerotolerant fungi can grow in dry 
environments at very low water activities. Osmotolerant fungi are found to grow in the environments at very low osmotic potential. About 20% of all known fungal species are obligate symbionts in lichens, but lichen-forming fungi remain neglected by mycologists and engineers and overlooked by industry (Crittenden and Porter, 1991). The role of thermophilic, alpine, and lichen-forming fungi in waste and wastewater treatment is largely unexplored.
1.9 MYCOREMEDIATION: FUNGAL BIOREMEDIATION
Fungi have been harnessed by humans in many diverse applications for thou-
sands of years. In any ecosystem, fungi are among the major decomposers of plant polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Fungi have the ability to mineralize, release, and store various elements and ions and accu-mulate toxic materials. They can facilitate energy exchange between the aboveground and belowground systems. Fungi have proven to modify soil permeability and soil ion exchange and to detoxify contaminated soil. Edible and/or medicinal fungi also play a role as natural environmental remediators (Pletsch et al., 1999), as do aquatic fungi (Hasija, 1994). Fungi are usually slow in growth and often require substrates for cometabolism. The mycelial growth habit of these organisms is responsible for the rapid colonization of substrates. Fungal liquid cultures constitute appropriate model systems to explore the biotransformation of a wide variety of compounds. The process of fungal biotransformation of compounds, wastes, or wastewaters is termed mycotransformation .
Fungal treatment of wastes in nature has been known for centuries. The 
ubiquitous presence of fungi has allowed acclimation of some types of wastes, if not most. Most of our knowledge related to interactions between fungi and wastes is based on studies performed in the laboratory. However, during the last decade, fungi have been used in the treatment of a wide variety of wastes and wastewaters, and the role of fungi in the bioremediation of various hazardous and toxic compounds in soils and sediments has been established. Fungi have also demonstrated the removal of metals and the degradation and mineralization of phenols and chlorinated phenolic compounds, petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated insecticides and pesticides, dyes, biopolymers, and other sub-stances in various matrices. The role of yeasts and fungi in the treatment of various wastes and wastewaters has been discussed by Singh (1991).
1.9.1 White-Rot Fungi in Bioremediation
White-rot fungi for lignin degradation have been examined for more than 
half a century. After the discovery of the extracellular oxidative ligninolytic enzymes of the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium , Bumpus et 
al. (1985) proposed the use of this fungus for bioremediation. Enzymes involved in the degradation of wood are also responsible for the degradation of a wide variety of persistent organic pollutants. The white-rot fungus P. 
chrysosporium  has emerged as an archetypal model system for fungal biore-
mediation. P. chrysosporium  has the ability to degrade toxic or insoluble 
compounds more efﬁ  ciently than other fungi or microorganisms. The numer-
ous oxidative and reductive mechanisms of degradation make its application attractive in different matrices. There has been a plethora of review articles onP. chrysosporium  with respect to mechanisms of degradation of recalci-
trant compounds and xenobiotics. In addition to P. chrysosporium , several 
other white-rot fungi (e.g., Pleurotus ostreatus ,Trametes versicolor ,Bjerkan-
dera adusta ,Lentinula edodes ,Irpex lacteus ) are known to degrade these 
compounds. Based on the literature of the past two decades, it appears that the white-rot fungi account for at least 30% of the total research on fungi use in bioremediation. White-rot fungi have added a new dimension to the already complex system of fungal bioremediation.
During the 1980s, marketing attempts by unskilled persons resulted in 
failures in white-rot fungal technology. Successful use depends on a compre-hensive knowledge of fungal physiology, biochemistry, enzymology, ecology, genetics, molecular biology, engineering, and several related disciplines. The ﬁ eld conditions and factors that induce fungal biodegradation are taken into 
consideration before development of the ﬁ  nal design. Lamar and White (2001) 
advocated the use of four phases in their approach: bench-scale treatability studies, on-site pilot testing, production of inoculum, and full-scale treatment. A variety of substrates, such as wood chips, wheat straw, peat, corncobs, sawdust, a nutrient-fortiﬁ  ed mixture of grain and sawdust, bark, rice, annual 
plant stems and wood, ﬁ  sh oil, alfalfa, spent mushroom compost, sugarcane 
bagasse, coffee pulp, sugar beet pulp, okra, canola meal, cyclodextrins, and s urf a c t a n t s ,  c a n  b e  e m p l o y e d  in  in o c ul um  p r o d u c t i o n  o ff - s i t e  o r  o n - s i t e  o r  mixed with contaminated soils to enhance degradation. Care is required to balance the carbon and nitrogen ratio in the substrates, which have a signiﬁ  -
cant inﬂ  uence on the degradative performance of white-rot fungi. Pelleted 
fungal inocula coated with alginate, gelatin, agarose, carrageenan, chitosan, and so on, are used by several researchers and offer several advantages over inocula produced using bulk substrates. This strategy, adapted from the mushroom spawn industry, is known as encapsulation . Encapsulation sustains 
the viability of the inoculum and provides sources of nutrition for the maximum degradation of pollutants (Bennett et al., 2001). This also enhances the survival and effectiveness of the introduced species. Solid-state fermenta-tion (SFF) is another method for producing fungal inoculum. However, fungi secrete several by-products during conversion of agricultural waste under SFF conditions (Cohen and Hadar, 2001).
Three phases of strategies are envisioned for the successful implementa-
tion of mycoremediation. Inoculum preparation techniques and their improve-ments lead to success in the ﬁ  rst phase of the use of white-rot fungi in MYCOREMEDIATION: FUNGAL BIOREMEDIATION 1718 INTRODUCTION
mycoremediation. The second phase includes clear technical protocols for the 
ﬁ nal design and associated engineering processes. The remediation protocols 
for the monitoring, adjustment, continuity, and maintenance of the engineer-ing system dictate the success of the third and ﬁ  nal phase of the mycoreme-
diation process. Competition from native microbial populations contributes to the outcome of mycoremediation, but protocols to eliminate such variabil-ity have yet to be developed. Processes using white-rot fungi have been pat-ented. A few companies, including EarthFax Development Corporation in Utah and Gebruder Huber Bodenrecycling in Germany, employ these fungi for soil bioremediation, but a broader use is not known at the present time.
1.10 ECOLOGY OF MYCOREMEDIATION
The literature on fungal ecology is voluminous, but little is known of the 
ecology and ecophysiology of white-rot or other fungi in mycoremediation. Thus, it is very important to understand the behavior and interactions of fungi in diverse ecosystems related to biodegradation of various hazardous and toxic compounds. Despite an estimate of 1.5 million species of fungi and the identiﬁ  cation of 69 000 fungal species worldwide (Hawksworth, 1991), the 
limited ecology of mycoremediation is known only in fewer than 10 species of fungi. Different techniques to study such ecology are required, as these are variable from one group or class or genus or species of fungi to another.
Soil or sediment is a poor matrix for the growth of fungi, due to low levels 
of substrates. The soil environment is also antagonistic to mycelial growth. In general, the diversity of fungal species and the number of propagules are reduced with increasing depth, and the fungi follow the distribution of organic ma tte r in soil h o rizons (Dix an d W e bste r , 1 995). Tha t is w h y m y ce lial n e t -works are present in each soil horizon and ﬂ  uctuate with seasonal growth 
patterns, rate of decomposition, and time. The development of fungal com-munities depends on a variety of environmental and biotic factors, such as the nature of carbon materials, quality and the quantity of nitrogen, presence of speciﬁ  c stimulators, temperature, hydrogen ion concentration, aeration, 
water availability and water potential, and interspeciﬁ  c competition. Fungi 
producing small amounts of biostatic or biocidal compounds can be employed in the process of mycoremediation. Many litter-decomposing and wood-decaying Basidiomycetes grow over the mycelia of other fungi and capture their nutrients. A plethora of literature exists on the ecology of lignocellulose degradation and litter decomposition by various wood-rotting fungi. A variety of ecosystem processes and ecosystem services are provided by fungi (Dighton, 2003).
Many members of the Mucorales, including the genera Rhizopus  and 
Mucor , are abundant in soils. These genera grow and colonize quickly and 
depend on soluble carbohydrates, but the enzyme activities of most Mucorales are limited. Some stress-tolerant species of Mucor ,Fusarium ,Gliocladium ,Penicillium , and Trichoderma grow under conditions of water and nutrient 
limitations, high temperature, and in the absence of oxygen and can be a target of mycoremediation.
Aquatic fungi are distributed in various groups of fungi, especially in 
Mastigomycetes, some in Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, and yeasts, and a few in Basidiomycetes. Some of these fungi remain in water, others are amphibious, and still others are aquatic for a short period of time. Aquatic fungi are found in freshwater or marine environments. The Order Halosphaeriales of Ascomycetes contains several genera and species inhabit-ing the marine ecosystem. Species of aquatic Hyphomycetes are well repre-sented on almost all substrates in freshwater systems (Barlocher, 1992). Several reviews on the ecology of aquatic fungi may be found in the literature. Knowledge of the nutritional proﬁ  les and enzyme activities of aquatic fungi 
is limited. However, it is necessary that attempts be made to employ aquatic fungi in the mycoremediation of contaminated surface waters, groundwaters, and wastewaters.
Our knowledge of the methodologies and ecological tools used to sustain 
fungal biomass, activity, and enzyme production in contaminated matrices is very limited and is a great hinderance to the process of mycoremediation. Ecological modeling related to these processes is highly complex and is not known at the present time. Eco-molecular markers, microanalysis methods, and so on, can be better tools than the results of experiments. Good emphasis is essential in this direction to achieve success in the process of mycoremediation.
1.11 GENETIC ENGINEERING OF MYCOREMEDIATION
Recent advances in molecular biology, biotechnology, and enzymology are 
the driving force toward engineer-improved fungi and enzymes for mycore-mediation. A number of the genetic engineering approaches that have been developed have proven beneﬁ  cial in adding the desired qualities in metabolic 
pathways or enzymes. Strain manipulation is becoming easier with the expo-nential expansion of molecular tool boxes and genome sequences. However, the best source is that of the genes of fungi, where mycotransformation is well understood. Speciﬁ  c gene alterations can be designed and controlled via 
metabolic engineering. Metabolic control is shared by enzymes (i.e., enzymes are democratic). Mathematical modeling of metabolic control analysis can be used to make predictions as to how metabolic pathways will respond to manipulation. Fungal genes can be cloned to meet the objectives of mycore-mediation. Fungal mutants that oversecrete speciﬁ  c enzymes can be pro-
duced, and various processes using such mutants may be designed and scaled up in the treatment of wastes and wastewaters. Fungal protoplasts can be exploited to enhance processes related to mycoremediation. At present, efforts to increase ﬂ  ux through speciﬁ  c pathways have met with limited GENETIC ENGINEERING OF MYCOREMEDIATION 1920 INTRODUCTION
success. Potentially, the future of metabolic engineering is bright, but there 
i s  s t i l l  a  l o n g  w a y  t o  g o  t o  u n d e r s t a n d  t h i s  a r e a  o f  t h e  m e t a b o l i c  n e t w o r k  before the introduction of bioengineered yeast or fungi in the ﬁ  eld of 
mycoremediation.
The ﬁ  rst complete eukaryotic genome belongs to the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae  (Dujon, 1996). The yeast genome contains 12 067 266 base pairs 
with 16 chromosomes and 6275 genes. The genome sequence has laid a strong foundation for work in the disciplines of agriculture, industry, medicine, and remediation. In a white paper for fungal comparative genomics, the Fungal Genome Initiative (FGI) Steering Committee identiﬁ  ed a coherent set of 44 
fungi as immediate targets for sequencing (Birren et al., 2003). Several p r o j e c t s  h a v e  r e l e a s e d  i n f o r m a t i o n  o n  t h e  g e n o m e  s e q u e n c e s  o f  t h e  y e a s t s  Schizosaccharomyces pombe  and Candida albicans and the ﬁ  lamentous fungi 
Aspergillus nidulans ,Aspergillus fumigatus ,Neurospora crassa , and Copri-
nus cinereus . The 13.8 million base pair genome of S. pombe  consists of 4940 
protein coding genes, including mitochondrial genome and genes (Wood et al., 2002). Ten thousand genes are predicted in the 40-Mb genome in the sequence of the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  lamentous fungus, N. crassa  (Galagan et al., 2003). The 
30 million base pair genome of the ﬁ  rst basidiomycete, Phanerochaete chryso-
sporium  strain RP78, has been sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun 
approach (Martinez, et al., 2004). The genome reveals genes encoding oxi-d a s e s ,  p e r o x i d a s e s ,  a n d  h y d r o l y t i c  e n z y m e s  i n v o l v e d  i n  w o o d  d e c a y .  T h i s  opens up new horizons related to the process of biodegradation of lignin and organopullutants and in the area of mycoremediation. Recently, yeast has been engineered with a binding afﬁ  nity to cellulose (Nam et al., 2002). Genes 
encoding the cellulose binding domain (CBD) from cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) and cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII) of Trichoderma reesei  have been 
expressed on the cell surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae .

FUNGAL TREATMENT OF 
INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
2.1 INTRODUCTION
There is growing concern around the world regarding environmental pollu-
tion caused by industrial wastewaters. The problem has caused tightened global discharge regulations. Regulatory and government agencies have focused on the remediation of wastewaters with reference to various treat-ment systems. Commercial applications in the monitoring and treatment of industrial waste streams continue to satisfy the licensing and permitting cri-teria of agencies all over the world. In this millennium, the environmental protection sector is concerned with the internalization of environmental policy and integration of environmental protection measures. In 2000, direc-tives of the European Commission were established to exercise inﬂ  uence on 
the environmental regulations of member states and consequently on techni-cal requirements. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had developed and implemented industrial wastewater regulations more than a decade earlier.
In developed and developing countries, increased environmental aware-
ness made it possible to understand and recover valuable resources for reuse. Recycling of resources has become an integral and viable economic activity for humankind. This has resulted in an increasing interest in water reuse because of the problems of water supply and increasing cost of disposal of wastewaters.

developments in biosensor technology. Despite these initiatives, public accep-
tance is low unless the water is passed through a natural step: for example, being returned to a river. Several books have been published on wastewater reuse and reclamation. Mann and Liu (1999) described wastewater minimiza-tion through water reuse, regeneration, and recycle, and through process changes and the design of distributed efﬂ  uent-treatment systems. Wastewater 
minimization through mathematical optimization has also been discussed. Total site wastewater reuse and regeneration has been discussed by Zbontar and Glavic (2000).
2.2 ALTERNATIVE INDUSTRIAL 
WASTEWATER BIOREACTORS
Bioreactors for the treatment of wastewaters have been known since 1970; 
however, activated sludge processes were employed as early as the 1920s. The capacity for wastewater treatment is proportional to the total biomass of a reactor. Advances in microbiology, biochemistry, biotechnology, and reactor engineering have developed various types of wastewater bioreactors. A pos-sible general biological growth systematics has been developed by Jianlong et al. (2000). Biochemical operations, stoichiometry and kinetics, modeling, and applications of suspended and attached growth reactors are outlined in Biological Wastewater Treatment  by Grady et al. (1999). In addition, design 
guidelines for bioreactors (Rossi, 2001) and bioreactor development (Mulder et al., 2001) have been presented.
Stirred tanks are the most common bioreactors for submerged cultivation. 
Other types of reactors, such as packed beds, bubble columns, airlift tower loops, and ﬂ  uidized beds, are also employed under certain conditions. Clog-
ging is usually a problem in packed-bed reactors because of the use of agri-cultural wastes as inexpensive substrates and nutrients with a large quantity of solids. The same is also true for fermentation wastewaters. Sedimentation o f  s o li d s  o cc ur s  in  b u b b l e  co l umn s .  In  ﬂ  uidized-bed and airlift tower loop 
reactors, solids can be suspended in the upﬂ  owing liquid. Several researchers 
have written reviews on bioﬂ  uidization (Furusaki, 1988; Shuler and Kargi, 
1992; Godia and Sola, 1995). Three-phase ﬂ  uidized and airlift suspension 
reactors are used for aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment and for the cultivation of immobilized and pellet-forming microorganisms, animals, and plant cells (Schugerl, 1997). Several types of cell immobilization can be used: (1) attachment of the microorganism to the surface of the carrier, (2) coloni-zation of a porous carrier by organisms, (3) immobilization in hydrogel, and (4) microbial pellets or granulated sludges.
An innovative process involving a gas-lift mobile bed and a circulating 
ﬂ oating-bed reactor (CFBR) for wastewater treatment has been proposed 
(Lazarova and Manem, 1996). The three-phase CFBR bioreactor does not require any complex devices (resulting in easier efﬂ  uent and airﬂ  ow distribu-tion, no primary settling, and no back washing). This bioreactor guarantees 
excellent synergy between hydrodynamic and biological performance. Barratt et al. (1997) employed the Chemox process for advanced oxidation of a variety of wastewaters. The rotating biological contactor (RBC) is commonly used as a wastewater treatment process. Commercially available cation complexing surfactants have been used in the remediation of wastewaters (Schwuger et al., 2001).
Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have an important place in wastewater 
treatment (Peters et al., 2000). An MBR employs ultraﬁ  ltration or micro-
ﬁ ltration membranes for complete retention of a biomass. The MBR 
Bio-Filt, based on an FM module for ultraﬁ  ltration and a bioreactor of 
modular design manufactured in multitank form, has been developed for the improvement of wastewater puriﬁ  cation, with a variety of easily adapt-
able applications. Membrane applications in various aerobic and anaerobic schemes for wastewater treatment have been described by Visvanathan et al. (2000).
Environmental biotechnology related to monitoring, mobilizing, and min-
eralizing pollution has been described in a report by Walters and Robinson (1997). This technology includes a membrane bioreactor coupled to an acti-vated sludge reactor to provide complete retention of sludge. Bioﬁ  lter reactors 
have certain advantages and disadvantages. A new type of bioﬁ  lter reactor, 
the biogenerator, addresses some of the disadvantages of bioﬁ  lter reactors. 
These days, the performance of wastewater treatment plants has become a focus for performance evaluation, and it is important to optimize these plants by kinetics and modeling. Flocculation, granulation and bioﬁ  lms, and video 
imaging are also used to measure bioﬁ  lm thickness in situ. Biosensors have 
potential applications in the monitoring processes of wastewater treatment, measuring the status of habitats in situ, and studying microbial gene regula-tion. A biological oxygen demand (BOD) biosensor is applied that uses immobilized yeasts and their modiﬁ  cations for efﬂ  uents from wastewater 
treatment plants (Tanaka et al., 1994). Combined wastewater treatment may achieve the goal of remediation.
2.3 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
Fungal treatment of wastewaters dates back to the 1960s. Yeasts and 
fungi are used extensively to reduce the strength of a wide variety of food-processing wastewaters with concomitant production of food or fodder yeasts and fungi. The most commonly used yeast is Candida utilis , because of its 
ability to utilize a wide variety of carbon and nitrogen sources, its capacity to grow rapidly in high yields, and its tolerance of low pH. Fungi Imperfecti have the ability to convert biodegradable organic matter into a mycelium that not only has a high enough protein content to be valuable as an animal feed sup-plement, but also forms ﬂ  ocs that can be recovered readily by simple ﬁ  ltration FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 3132 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
and screening. Some aspects of fungal treatment of industrial wastewaters 
have been highlighted by Nandan and Raisuddin (1992).
Several case histories of wastewater treatment by fungi have been described 
during the past decades. Lemonade-processing wastewater can be assimilated by yeasts (Hang, 1980). The amount of Saccharomyces fragilis  growth paral-
lels the BOD reduction of the wastewater. The settleability of S. fragilis  is 
found to depend on temperature and age. Three strains of Rhodotorula  have 
the ability to utilize ( +)-limonene as a sole carbon source in the form of vapor 
(Thanh et al., 2004). These yeasts appear to have a coenzyme Q
10 system. C.
utilis  has been used in the treatment of sauerkraut waste (Hang et al., 1973). 
The yeast is capable of removing approximately 80%, 70%, and 90% of the waste BOD, nitrogen, and phosphorus, respectively, in 16 hours. The addition of 0.05% sodium hydrogen phosphate resulted in increased utilization of brine components in the aerobic fermentation of pickle process brine by C.utilis  ( S t e v e n s o n  e t  a l . ,  1 9 7 9 ) .  S u p p l e m e n t a t i o n  w i t h  s o d i u m  p h o s p h a t e  
reduced the BOD to 91%.
Celite is used as a carrier for fungi, but clogging occurs as a result of exces-
sive growth and ﬂ  uffy bioﬁ  l m  f o r m a t i o n .  T h i s  i s  c o n t r o l l e d  b y  p h o s p h a t e  
limitation in fungi. Low spore concentration, a dilute medium, and low shear stress favor pellet formation. Pellet-forming fungi can be cultivated in aerated ﬂ uidized beds, bubble columns, or suspended airlift loop reactors. However, 
pellets can grow excessively at a low energy dissipation rate. Above a critical pellet size, depletion of oxygen leads to cell death, resulting in the formation of hollow pellets. Fungal mycelium is attached to the particle or penetrates the particle in the presence of solid substrates and forms pelletlike conglomer-ates. The substrate is utilized during growth and the pellets turn into ﬁ  lamen-
tous mycelia. Hairy pellets are produced, forming a viscous suspension similar to ﬁ lamentous fungi at a low energy dissipation rate. A multistage anaerobic 
reactor of 650 to 700 m
3 working volume has also been used for the treatment 
of baker’s yeast wastewater (Markl and Reinold, 1994; Reinold et al., 1996).
Despite the discussion of different types of wastewater treatment by fungi 
reported elsewhere in the literature, in this chapter only the latest knowledge on speciﬁ  c wastewaters of important industrial types and their treatment by 
fungi is presented.
2.3.1 Starch-Processing Wastewater
2.3.1.1 Background.  Starch is a polysaccharide that occurs widely in plants 
in the form of reserve food material. Starch-processing wastewater is pro-duced in large quantities, especially from food-processing plants all over the world. When discharged to lakes and rivers, the high organic load in the pro-cessing wastewater is a big concern relative to water quality. Most earlier studies reported the sterilization of materials employed as substrates. These processes require aseptic conditions and a retention time of more than 1 day. All these factors contribute to increased cost. About 25 to 30 × 10
3 tons of sago, a principal cheap source of starch, is exported from Malaysia annually 
(Shim, 1992). Solid and liquid sago-processing wastes have been depicted diagrammatically by Vikineswary et al. (1994).
2.3.1.2 Composition and Characteristics.  The production of sago-
processing waste wa ter can reach as m uch as 1 000 m
3 per day in an average 
industry. A large amount of starch and pith residue is responsible for the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) in sago wastewater (Chew and Shim, 1990). The cassava-processing industry generates wastewater that is known as manipueira . The wastewater has a pH 
of 5.5, 60 000 mg/l COD, 38 g/l reducing and 20.2 g/l nonreducing sugars, and several minerals (Damasceno et al., 2003). Vermicelli factories discharge wastewaters containing high concentrations of starch and protein with high COD and BOD, respectively. The composition of synthetic starch wastewater has been noted by Fujita et al. (1993). This acidic starch-processing wastewa-ter contains high carbohydrate (2360 to 3550 mg/l), starch (1520 to 2580 mg/l), and sugar (0.65 to 1.18%) contents along with high COD (11 970 to 18 900) and BOD (7980 to 12 800 mg/l) and phosphate, sulfate, total Kjeldahl-N, and other constituents (Jin et al., 1999a). Proper treatment of such wastewaters is imperative.
2.3.1.3 Bioreactors and Fermentation.  Yeast strains can reduce the waste-
water strength of potato-processing wastewater along with the recovery of biomass (Karim and Sistrunk, 1985). Fermentation with the yeast Saccharo-
myces ﬁ  buliger  ATCC 9947 effectively reduces COD in lye- and steam-peeled 
wastewaters. Vermicelli wastewater has also been treated using an acid-tolerant starch-degrading yeast (Hu, 1989). A semicontinuous culture removed about 92% COD at an appropriate hydraulic retention time (HRT) and solid retention time. A mixed culture of Candida utilis  and Endomycopsis ﬁ  buliger
efﬁ ciently assimilated both starch and free sugars in cassava starch efﬂ  uent 
(Manilal et al., 1991). This treatment resulted in the reduction of about 94% of COD and 91% of BOD. An effective model has been proposed for continu-ous and two-stage fermentation with a pure amylolytic yeast ﬁ  rst stage and a 
mixed culture second stage with a faster-growing nonamylolytic yeast (Pasari et al., 1989). Geotrichum fragrans  utilizes sugars, thus reducing 40% of the 
COD of cassava wastewater (Damasceno et al., 2003). A process for high-lat treatment of predominantly carbohydrate-containing wastewater is discussed in a U.S. patent (Chigusa and Matsumaru, 1991).
The formation of pellets by Aspergillus niger  ATCC 6275 and its applica-
tions to starch wastewater treatment have been examined (Fujita et al., 1993). One experiment was employed for pellet formation and a second was evalu-ated for a continuous starch wastewater treatment. T wo reactors attached in series had the same conﬁ  guration, with aeration and separation volumes of 
1.1 L and 0.9 L, respectively. The pellets exhibited a 90% ability for starch decomposition and 75% for TOC removal, thereby proving effective in starch FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 3334 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
wastewater treatment. The sago hampas can be subject to fungal degradation 
(Shim, 1992). Sago ﬁ  bers and starch remaining in the hampas are degraded 
by a thermophilic fungus, Myceliophthora thermophila . During solid-state 
fermentation of sago hampas using M. thermophila , the highest cellulolytic 
and amylolytic activities on raw starch were 1300 IU/kg dried sago hampas and 1800 IU/kg dried sago hampas, respectively, after 72 hours. The ﬁ  nal 
protein content of the upgraded product was not high; however, an improve-ment of more than 200% was achieved.
A strain of Aspergillus oryzae  produces a fungal biomass protein and α-
amylase in starch-processing wastewater (Jin et al., 1998). A one-stage non-aseptic airlift bioreactor removed 95% of the COD, 93% of the BOD, and 98% of the suspended solids and can be employed for agricultural irrigation. Starch-processing wastewater was treated with Rhizopus oligosporus  in a 
laboratory-scale bench system using a 45-L airlift bioreactor with a working volume of 3.5 L (Jin et al., 1999a). Aeration in the range 1.0 to 1.7 (v/v) per minute was regulated to maintain the dissolved oxygen (DO) above 50% of saturation. The process proved efﬁ  cient for the removal of complete sus-
pended solids and a 96% reduction in COD. The economic aspects do not include pretreatment, but require nutrient supplementation together with nonaseptic operating conditions (Jin et al., 1998, 1999a). Starch hydrolysis occurs rapidly, at a rate of 0.19 g/l per hour for 10 hours and slows down afterward. An internal airlift loop reactor with a ceramic honeycomb support for bioﬁ  lm (IAL-CHS) with Candida tropicalis  is used in high-carbohydrate 
wastewater treatment (Zhang et al., 2005). This immobilized reactor accu-mulates dense and large amounts of biomass and produces a signiﬁ  cant 
amount of single-cell protein (SCP). The carbohydrates are fermented to organic acid, thus lowering the pH and causing COD reduction.
2.3.1.4 Enzyme Treatment.  Starch-processing wastes can be amenable to 
conversion into food, feed, or nonfood products with added value. The use of enzymes and enzymatic processing to reduce food wastes and to clean up food waste streams has been summarized by Shoemaker (1986). Amylases are polysaccharide hydrolases that are employed in the simultaneous sac-chariﬁ  cation and fermentation of starch and treatment of starch-processing 
wastewaters. Amylases can also be used for the production of alcohol from rice-processing wastewaters. α-Amylase and glucoamylase are also used in 
the production of photodegradable and biodegradable plastics (Coleman, 1990). The process entails the conversion of starch contained in potato waste to biodegradable plastics. Potential applications of enzymes in food-processing wastes have been discussed by Karam and Nicell (1997).
Glucoamylase is one of the most important enzymes used in food process-
ing and in the commercial production of glucose from starch. This enzyme has the ability to hydrolyze starch almost completely into glucose. The fungal glucoamylases have been reviewed by Manjunath et al. (1983) and Norouzian et al. (2006). Many fungi produce glucoamylases under different fermentation conditions, but species of Aspergillus  and Rhizopus  are widely employed 
in their commercial production. Recently, the amylolytic enzymes (i.e., α-
amylase and glucoamylase from the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanu-
ginosus  s t r a i n  A T C C  3 4 6 2 6 )  h a v e  b e e n  p u r i ﬁ  ed (Nguyen et al., 2002). 
However, no information is available regarding the production of glucoamy-lase from wastes. Enzymes have a limited future in wastewater treatment. However, the full potential of enzymes has not been realized and a number o f  i s s u e s  ( e . g . ,  i d e n t i ﬁ  cation and characterization of reaction by-products, 
disposal of reaction residues, and reduction of costs) still need to be addressed. Additional research will also be required to determine the suitability of enzymes under particular conditions and to optimize the enzymatic process as a whole.
2.3.1.5 Production of Fungal Protein.   In one report, about 1.55 to 2.0 g/l 
of the dry weight of centrifuged yeast solids from fermented steam-peeled potato wastewater was recovered after 6 to 28 hours of fermentation, which amounts to a crude protein content of 29 to 31% (Karim and Sistrunk, 1985). The recovered protein content of biomass was 22% (w/w) after 28 hours, which remained unchanged during 60 hours of fermentation (Manilal et al., 1991). Several possibilities for the utilization of sago-processing wastes have been recognized (Vikineswary et al., 1994). These include mushroom produc-tion, upgrading of animal feed, and production of algal biomass. The sago hampas can be used as raw material for the production of cellulose, xylanase, and raw starch–degrading enzymes during the preliminary submerged fer-mentation (Vikineswary and Nadaraj, 1992).
Fungal treatment of starch-processing wastewater can produce valuable 
products, such as the fungal biomass concomitant with puriﬁ  cation of the 
efﬂ uent. The exponential growth of biomass was found to occur between 6 
and 12 hours at a speciﬁ  c growth rate of 0.15 g/h (Jin et al., 1999a). The 
process resulted in the production of 4.5 to 5.2 g of dry biomass from 1 L of starch wastewater in 14 hours of cultivation. The fungal biomass contained a high (46%) protein content and was safe for human and animal consumption. This protein is marketable and the operating costs can be recovered. The glucoamylase activity in the culture ﬁ  ltrate increased proportionately with 
starch hydrolysis and biomass synthesis. Enzyme production remained unaf-fected by nutrient additions. This appears to be the ﬁ  rst report regarding the 
production of glucoamylase from waste.
Growth pH, inoculum type and size, and superﬁ  cial air velocity were found 
to have an effect on the mycelial morphology and fungal protein from starch-processing wastewater in submerged cultures by three strains of Aspergillus
oryzae  using an airlift bioreactor under nonaseptic conditions (Jin et al., 
1999b). An inoculum technique was developed based on the morphology related to improved yield of fungal protein. The inﬂ  uence of inoculum quality 
on productivity, speciﬁ  c growth rate, and protein content reveals that the 
formation of small compact pellets favors the efﬁ  ciency of biomass protein FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 3536 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
production, harvesting, and better process operation. The yield of biomass 
protein was 6.1 g/l, which contains 38% protein, and 55 EU/ml of α-amylase 
from a 12-hour batch culture (Jin et al., 1998). The pellets favored easy har-vesting of biomass protein. Geotrichum fragrans  produced 12.8 g/l of biomass 
on cassava liquid waste after 12 hours (Damasceno et al., 2003). This cultiva-tion resulted in the formation of several volatile compounds after 72 hours.
2.3.2 Dairy Industry Wastewater
2.3.2.1 Background.  The dairy industry is one of the largest single sources 
of food-processing wastewaters in the world. Signiﬁ  cant impacts are caused 
by the cheese industry, due to release of its by-product, whey. Based on 13.5 million tons of cheese production in the world in 1993, release of whey can be calculated to be 121 million tons. The reports indicate that there is 50% global utilization of whey and that the rest is not disposed of properly. There are many well-documented articles in the literature on alternative methods of whey utilization, including yeast fermentation. The principal components in whey are lactose (44 to 52 g/l), proteins (6 to 8 g/l), and mineral salts (4.3 to 9.5 g/l) (Jelen, 1992). About 50% of the whey produced in the world every year is treated in wastewater treatment plants, discharged onto the land, or disposed of in lakes, rivers, or other water bodies. Whey is a signiﬁ  cant source 
of organic pollution, with a high COD value of 50 000 to 80 000 mg/l and a BOD value of 40 000 to 60 000 mg/l, depending on the type of cheese. Lactose is responsible for 90% of whey’s COD and BOD. Due to its high BOD level, the biological processes in wastewater treatment plants can be disrupted. In addition, continuous discharge of whey onto land can affect the properties of the soil, reduce crop yields, contribute to serious groundwater contamination, and eventually, pose a threat to human health and the environment.
Lactose cannot be assimilated by several microorganisms. Lactic acid bac-
teria can utilize it easily and lower the ﬁ  nal pH, thus making it inhibitory for 
microbial growth. Lactose hydrolysis can be one of the solutions. At least 98 yeast species belonging to 19 genera can utilize lactose (Barnett et al., 1979). The utilization of lactose as a sole source of carbon and energy by yeasts usually requires a combination of lactose transport and lactase. However, strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  contain lactase but are unable to utilize 
it, due to the lack of lactose transport (Barnett, 1981). Lactose metabolism and properties, and the regulation of lactose transport and lactases by yeasts, have been well summarized (Castillo, 1990). Kluyveromyces fragilis  strains 
are employed for the production of yeast biomass from whey and can result in signiﬁ  cant reduction of pollution load. In addition, large-scale processes 
have been in operation for the last several years for the production of K. fra-
gilis biomass. Several researchers have reported a change in metabolism 
during aerated cultures of some K. fragilis  strains. This change ranges from 
oxidation to mixed oxidation–fermentation, resulting in the formation of metabolic products such as alcohols, aldehydes, and esters.2.3.2.2 Bioreactors and Modeling.  Physical, chemical, and microbiologi-
cal characterizations of dairy efﬂ  uents collected periodically and their treat-
ment in batches using free and alginate-entrapped Candida pseudotropicalis
cells have been presented (Marwaha et al., 1989). Immobilized yeast cell treatment proves slightly better than that for free yeast cells. COD and BOD are found to be diluted to the Indian Standard Institution’s safe levels by both systems. The biomass yield and COD removal efﬁ  ciency of the fermentation 
process were studied in batches in shaken-ﬂ  ask and laboratory- and pilot-
scale fermentors in the 1980s. Moresi et al. (1989) examined the scale-up of batch whey fermentation by K. fragilis  to a 1000-dm
3 stirred fermentor by 
varying the stirrer speed, airﬂ  ow rate, and initial concentration of lactose. A 
series of empirical regressions based on various operating conditions and geometric dissimilarity allow approximate but acceptable prediction of the stoichiometric and kinetic coefﬁ  cients, thus conﬁ  rming the capability of this 
model to scale up this fermentation process to production scale. The kinetics of continuous whey fermentation by K. fragilis  has been studied in a 30-dm
3
stirred fermentor at different dilution rates and feed concentrations of lactose 
(Moresi et al., 1990). The concept of material and energy balances makes it possible to check the consistency of the steady-state responses of a chemostat culture on whey as well as to develop an unstructured model on a Monod-type kinetic equation for cell growth and two independent linear equations for lactose and oxygen consumption rates.
O xy g e n  t r an s f e r  f o r  l a c t i c  y e a s t  p r o d u c t i o n  o n  w h e y  s u b s t r a t e s  u s in g  an  
industrial airlift bioreactor has been modeled (Pigache et al., 1992). The fer-mentor consists of a 120-m
3 concentric-tube airlift reactor with a diameter of 
3.80 m. Three empirical equations are used to express the Bunsen absorption coefﬁ  cient a, Klag, and (Kla)r, and ﬁ  ve parameters are used for the adjust-
ment. The simulation displays an improvement in the fermentation process and calculations of the optimal operating conditions according to the produc-tion objectives. This tool can be applied as an operator guide and provides new perspectives for industrial fermentor design. The differences are exhib-ited in the growth kinetic behavior of Torulopsis cremoris  in batch and con-
tinuous cultures (Cristiani-Urbina et al., 1997). The growth of T. cremoris  on 
whey is described by a Monod equation. In a batch culture, T. cremoris  shows 
a maximum speciﬁ  c growth rate 26% higher than that estimated in a continu-
ous culture. This rate is higher than that of K. fragilis , which is employed in 
large-scale processes for biomass production from whey.
Yeasts have the ability to hydrolyze lactose in dairy efﬂ  uents (Berruga et 
al., 1997). The disappearance of lactose in permeate is poorly correlated with 
intracellular lactase levels. Candida keﬁ  r NCYC 143 and Kluyveromyces
marxianus  NCYC 1548 cells show a maximum lactase activity of 200 nM ONP 
per minute 10 per cells. K. marxianus  MTCC 1288 metabolized most of the 
lactose within 22 hours, to produce 8.8 g/l biomass and 2.10 g/l ethanol (Zafar and Owais, 2005). Bales and Castillo (1979) obtained an activity of 4 to 5 units on supplemented deproteinized whey. These ﬂ  uctuations can also be FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 3738 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
attributed to the reciprocal effects between lactase activity and both galactose 
(1.9 mM) and lactose (0 to 143 mM) concentrations in the permeate (Berruga et al., 1997).
Some bioreactors in whey/dairy efﬂ  uents are noted in Table 2.1. Mixed 
yeast cultures are used to treat whey in batch and fed-batch fermentation under nonsterile conditions (Cristiana-Urbina et al., 2000). An airlift biore-actor with a total volume of 3.5 L is shown in Figure 2.1. The bioreactor column consists of Pyrex glass with a lower internal diameter of 7.7 cm, an upper internal diameter of 9.7 cm, and a total height of 72.4 cm. Of mixed yeast cultures, Torulopsis cremoris  and Candida utilis  produce the highest 
yield of biomass, with a value of 0.454 g of biomass per gram of lactose. T.
cremoris  produces extracellular metabolic products, such as organic acids, 
which are consumed by C. utilis . Moresi et al. (1989) found the whey lactose 
selectivity by K. fragilis , and when the carbon source was exhausted, the yeast 
utilized the intermediate compounds (ethanol, esters, glycerol, etc.) that had accumulated in the medium, thus exhibiting a diauxic growth pattern. A lactose–(NH
4)2SO 4 ratio of 12 is optimal for cell yield (0.421 g/g), lactose 
consumption (100%), and COD removal (84%) without the addition of KH
2PO 4. Batch culture exhibits overall biomass yields of 0.349 and 0.459 g of 
biomass per gram of lactose for pure T. cremoris  and mixed yeast cultures, 
respectively. The COD removal efﬁ  ciencies are 87.13 and 92.68% for pure T.
cremoris  and mixed yeast cultures, respectively. The biomass yield obtained 
for a fed-batch culture of T. cremoris  and C. utilis  is greater than those for 
K. fragilis  (Litchﬁ  eld, 1983; Moresi et al., 1989), K. marxianus  (Bainotti et 
al., 1987), and T. cremoris  (Cristiani-Urbana et al., 1997); for mixed cultures 
of K. fragilis–K. lactis–Torulopsis bovina  (Moulin et al., 1983; Pigache et al., 
1992) and Candida kefyr–C. valida  (Carlotti et al., 1991); and is similar to 
that of K. fragilis  ( G h a l y  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 2 ) .  T h e  C O D  r e m o v a l  r a t e  b y  t h i s  
mixed culture is greater than those for K. fragilis  (Moresi et al., 1990; Ben-
Hassan and Ghaly, 1994) and K. marxianus  (Bainotti et al., 1987). A new β-
galactosidase–based biocatalyst has been developed by immobilization of whole K. lactis  c e ll s  in  c a l c i um–a l g in a t e  b e a d s  ( B e c e rr a  e t  a l . ,  200 1 ).  Th e

growing cells in the same medium. The permeabilized immobilized cells increased the hydrolysis rate of lactose: about 99.5% of milk-whey lactose at 30°C in 30 hours without ethanol production.
2.3.2.3 Production of Fungal Biomass.  Production of yeast biomass, 
ethanol, and lactase or oils can be effective for the treatment of whey perme-ate, which reduces BOD by 90 to 95%. The production of yeast by fermenting the lactose in whey has been a subject of great interest, especially for Castillo (1990) and Kilara and Patel (1992). The majority of studies are focused on the lactic yeasts, mostly K. fragilis , which provides good biomass yield and accept-
ability as a safe microorganism. K. fragilis  produces a higher biomass yield 
at a low concentration of lactose, implying an increase in the production 97 mm

of metabolic products with increased lactose concentration (Moresi et al., 
1989, 1990). Similar behavior is found in aerated cultures of K.lactis  (Gonzal ez 
S i s o  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 6 ) ,  C. pseudotropicalis  (Bales and Castillo, 1979), C. kefyr
(Carlotti et al., 1991), and T. cremoris  (Cristiani-Urbina et al., 1997).
Several yeast species are known for the production of ethanol by lactose 
fermentation with more than 90% conversion efﬁ  ciency. Several researchers 
have explored ethanol production by continuous fermentation with cell cycle or cell immobilization. Maiorella and Castillo (1984) presented process ﬂ  ow 
diagrams for the production of yeast biomass, lactase production, and ethanol production from whey. A schematic presentation of the entire whey process, various products and their applications, lactose manufacturing, and potential problems has been made by Marwaha and Kennedy (1988). Biogas, the bio-chemistry of methane production and energy analysis, ethanol production and various processes, and the production of organic acids, amino acids, gibberel-lic acid, polysaccharides, lipids, and ﬂ  avor compounds from whey have also 
been discussed by Kilara and Patel (1992).
2.3.2.4 Lactases.  Lactases can be employed in the hydrolysis of lactose in 
milk products, including whey, to reduce or eliminate problems associated with lactose intolerance in children and adults. Lactic yeasts are excellent sources of lactase, and these include K. fragilis  (Sonawat et al., 1981), K. lactis
(Gonzalez and Berry, 1982), C. pseudotropicalis  (Itoh et al., 1982; Gomez 
and Castillo, 1983), K. marxianus  (Goncalves and Castillo, 1981), and Sac-
charomyces anamensis  (Banerjee et al., 1982). The optimum conditions for 
lactase production do not always coincide with those of biomass production. Fenton (1982) discussed solvent treatment for improved recovery of lactase. Many commercial lactase preparations are available in both soluble and immobilized form, but these are expensive for wastewater treatment. Lactases are also employed in dairy waste processing to produce value-added products (Shoemaker, 1986; Blasheck, 1992). Conversion of lactose from lactose hydro-lysis in whey to l-ascorbic acid can be catalyzed by l-galactonolactone oxidase 
from the yeast Candida norvegensis  (Shoemaker, 1986).
2.3.2.5 Genetics of Lactose Utilization.  It is important to obtain stable 
strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  to utilize lactose by genetic modiﬁ  cation. 
The natural ability of S. cerevisiae  to utilize lactose as a carbon source is solved 
by genetic manipulation following various strategies. The construction of a Lac
+ strain of Saccharomyces  that carries the LAC4  and LAC12  genes of K.
lactis , encoding for a β-galactosidase and a lactose permease, respectively, was 
ﬁ rst reported by Sreekrishna and Dickson (1985). This strain grows poorly in 
a medium with lactose and is mitotically unstable. Another strain of Saccha-
romyces  grows in a medium with lactose by coexpression of the Escherichia
coli lacZ  gene and the S. cerevisiae GAL4  gene (Perro et al., 1992). Cell lysis 
can occur due to overexpression of GAL4 . Lac+ strains of S. cerevisiae  are 
also constructed based on expression of secretable β-galactosidase encoded by the lacA  gene of Aspergillus niger  (Kumar et al., 1992). These strains grow 
in a medium with lactose, but the Lac phenotype is unstable and the utilization of sugar subjects it to diauxic growth (Ramakrishnan and Hartley, 1993).
A diploid strain of S. cerevisiae  MRY286 is constructed that can assimilate 
lactose with high efﬁ  c i e n c y  ( R u b i o - T e x e i r a  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 8 ) .  T h i s  g e n e t i c a l l y  
stable strain carries multiple copies of K. lactis LAC4  and LAC12  genes that 
encode for a β-galactosidase and a lactose permease, respectively. A similar 
approach is employed to construct a Lac
+ industrial strain of baker’s yeast that 
can  b e  p r o p a g a t e d  in  w h e y  ( A d am  e t  al . ,  1 999 ).  T o  ﬁ  nd Lac+ strains of S.
cerevisiae  with optimal performance, strains differing in dosage of LAC  genes 
have been constructed (Rubio-Texeira et al., 2000). A new strain is also being constructed that combines the Lac
+ phenotype with other traits of biotechno-
logical interest, such as ﬂ  occulence and the ability to assimilate starch.
2.3.3 Pharmaceutical Industry Wastewater
2.3.3.1 Background.  Little attention is paid to the release of pharmaceuti-
cal substances exposed to the environment, which can also be recognized as environmental micropollutants. These are substances with known speciﬁ  c 
biological effects. Antibiotics employed as growth promoters or feed additives for a variety of animals often end up in the environment. Few studies are known that report results of medical substances in ﬁ  eld samples other than 
those of sediment or treated wastewater. Several substances of pharmaceuti-cal waste seem to persist in the environment. Current knowledge of the occur-rence, fate, and effects of pharmaceutical wastes in the environment, including different exposure routes to the environment and legislation, has been described (Halling-Sorensen et al., 1998).
The activities of a pharmaceutical plant at Snackviken, Sweden, result in 
the discharge of approximately 1000 m
3/day of wastewater with a COD of 3 
to 4 g/l. At another pharmaceutical plant, located at Gartuna, Sweden, the ﬂ ow of wastewater is approximately 100 m
3/day with a COD of 0.8 to 1.5 g/l. 
At present, activated carbon is used to treat the most toxic portion (Rosen et al., 1998). The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency investigated the fact that wastewaters from the plants were highly toxic and contained large amounts of persistent organic material and phosphorus. Wastewater from the Snackviken plant was previously treated by evaporation in combination with reverse osmosis; today, it is incinerated. The ﬁ  nal forms of the pharmaceutical 
wastes were characterized by Alvarino et al. (1997). Processes in formulation and preparation plants include the mixing of solid or liquid substances, pelletizing, encapsulating, and packing. These operational processes do not produce excessive wastes. The overall BOD of the entire waste is about 44 to 752 mg/l. The treatment includes pH control, 12-hour holding in an equaliza-tion basin, primary clariﬁ  cation, trickling ﬁ  ltration, and secondary clariﬁ  ca-
tion. Sludges are removed, dewatered, and disposed of in a landﬁ  ll. The BOD 
of the ﬁ  nal efﬂ  uent is reduced to 30 mg/l.FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 4142 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
Production of the majority of drugs leads to large variations in wastewater 
composition. Continuous development of new drugs and production methods also cause changes in the characteristics of wastewaters over time. Under such conditions it is necessary to examine and develop stable and cost-effective treatment methods for such wastewaters.
2.3.3.2 Process Development.  In three pilot-scale tests, the multistage 
bioﬁ lm process showed the elimination of 90% of the COD and 95% of the 
total organic carbon (TOC) with better removal of toxicity (Rosen et al., 1998). The disadvantage of this process is that the pH must be adjusted to 4 in the fungal stages and then raised to 7. The methanogenic activity tests are also used for the determination of anaerobic biodegradability of some con-centrated pharmaceutical wastes (i.e., waste biomass from threonine produc-tion, mycelium after Penicillium  extraction, and excess activated sludge from 
the treatment of other pharmaceutical wastewaters) (Zabranska et al., 1994). Anaerobic biodegradability of each waste and mixture of wastes was evalu-ated. An optimum substrate concentration and methane yield for each waste and mixture were determined.
2.3.3.3 Conclusions.  Organic material, phosphorus, and toxicity can be 
removed to a higher degree by the incorporation of fungal treatment. Treat-ability studies for the degradation of speciﬁ  c compounds in batch and con-
tinuous laboratory-scale processes are recommended before application in pilot-scale tests. When researching and developing new drugs and synthetic methods for compounds of pharmaceutical interest, it is important to consider the biodegradability of discharges to wastewaters.
2.3.4 Protein-Containing Wastewater
2.3.4.1 Background.  Large amounts of protein- and fat-containing waste-
waters released from slaughterhouses and tanneries are discharged to the environment. Fungi can easily be employed in the treatment of such waste-waters. Biodegradation of fat into a yeast biomass can meet two beneﬁ  cial 
objectives: (1) removal of fat from the wastewater and easier handling of the remaining waste for subsequent processing (e.g., extraction of soluble proteins or methane generation), and (2) use of the yeast biomass as a feed supplement. Since the 1970s, researchers have focused on the production of yeast cells using fat- or protein-containing wastewater. Oil from Atlantic menhaden is u s e d  t o  c ul t i v a t e  s e v e r al  t yp e s  o f  y e a s t s  ( B ur k h o l d e r  e t  al . ,  1 968 ).  F i s h  o il  (Hottinger et al., 1974) and stickwater, a by-product of the ﬁ  sh meal and oil 
industries (Green et al., 1976), are employed as substrates for Candida lipo-
lytica  and Geotrichum candidum , respectively. Saccharomycopsis lipolytica
can grow on tallow or lard as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen (Tan and Gill, 1985).About 3000 tons per month of wastewater produced by a company 
in Sweden contained approximately 6 to 8 g/l of fat and 10 to 13 g/l of protein (Rydin et al., 1990). Similar contents, 0.05% protein and 0.03% fat, in the wastewater from slaughterhouses, are also known (Grant, 1976). The fat contained 90% free fatty acids and the ash content included some iron and calcium. The composition of fatty acids in the wastewater was similar to the composition of tallow. It contained 43% oleic acid, 23% palmitic acid, 14% stearic acid, 7% linoleic acid, 4% palmitoleic acid, 2% myristic acid, and 2% linoleneic acid. The amino acid content was similar to that of gelatine.
2.3.4.2 Bioreactors. Candida tropicalis  S001 grows and utilizes protein-
containing wastewater (Rydin et al., 1990). A schematic process for biocon-version of fat- and protein-containing wastewater is shown in Figure 2.2. The cultures are performed in a 1.0- or 3.0-L fermentor with working volumes of 0.8 and 2.5 L, respectively. The fermentor cultures (batch and continuous) on wastewater are inoculated using a simple standard procedure at 800 rpm and on the model substrate (triolein) at 600 rpm under different environmental conditions. A 500-ml ﬂ  uidized-bed bioreactor is employed for the production 
of methane generated from the protein phase of the wastewater. The maximum speciﬁ  c growth rate of C. tropicalis  S001 increases in the order triolein <

glycerol < wastewater < glucose. The highest biomass yield (0.97 g dry weight/
g fat) occurs on glycerol, followed by triolein (0.68 g dry weight/g fat) and glucose (0.57 g dry weight/g fat). In continuous cultures, the yeast growth rate coincides closely to that in batch cultures under similar conditions. The bio-reactor reduces 86% of the COD using a feed of 40 kg COD/m
3 per day. The 
rate of methane production is 10.8 m3/m3 reactor per day, which constitutes a 
yield of 0.31 m3 methane/kg COD red. The growth of yeasts at a low pH gener-
ally provides a sterilizing effect in a continuous system for its domination. Most bacteria cannot grow or compete for growth at low pH. Several yeasts are well recognized to grow on lipids between pH 3.5 and 4.0 [e.g., Candida
lipolytica  (Hottinger et al., 197 4), S. lipolytica  (Tan and Gill, 1984), and C.
tropicalis  (Rydin et al., 1990)].
2.3.5 Oil Manufacturing Plant Wastewater
2.3.5.1 Background.  Several physical and chemical processes using a dis-
solved ﬂ  otation unit are established as a pretreatment for high concentrations 
of oil-containing wastewaters. The pretreatment usually requires a large quantity of chemicals, such as coagulants, acids, and alkalis, and the disposal of ﬂ oating waste oil arising from the treatment process. The London Dumping 
Treaty, implemented in 1996, prohibits disposal of wastes in oceans. A bio-logical process has been developed for the treatment of oils without pretreat-ment (Chigusa et al., 1996). This process also greatly reduced the generation of ﬂ oating waste oil to be disposed of.
Wastewater from a soybean oil manufacturing plant was comprised of 88% 
oils, 3% carbohydrates, 3% proteins, and 6% unknown substances (Chigusa e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 6 ) .  T h e  i n ﬂ  uent COD, BOD, and hexane extract concentrations 
range from 24 000 to 61 000 mg/l, 12 000 to 27 200 mg/l, and 6700 to 17 000 mg/l, respectively. The pH range of the wastewater is 6.5 to 7.5. Most of the oils are detected in the form of suspended solids, and these are between 5990 and 16 600 mg/l. Total nitrogen ranges from 401 to 497 mg/l.
In Malaysia, palm oil mill efﬂ  uent (POME) is a major source of pollution, 
with an annual generation of 9 million tons (Chan et al., 1983). This efﬂ  uent 
contains a high organic load and needs to be treated before discharge to any water body. The anaerobic fermentation of POME has been examined by some researchers (Sinnappa, 1979; Ibrahim et al., 1984). Anaerobic fermenta-tion by bacteria takes more hydraulic retention time for the digestion of POME. However, some workers have discussed the roles of Aspergillus oryzae
(Barker and Morgan, 1981) and Penicillium chrysogenum  (Suwandi and 
Mohd, 1984) in the treatment of POME efﬂ  uents. Trichoderma viride  also 
plays a role in the treatment of POME (Karim and Kamil, 1989). The POME from a site in India contains about 250 000 mg/l COD, 11 000 mg/l BOD, 65 mg/l total dissolved solids, and 9000 mg/l of chloroform-soluble material (Oswal et al., 2002). Montet et al. (1983) used palm oil for the production of single-cell protein (SCP) by Candida rugosa .2.3.5.2 Assay of Oil-Decomposing Ability.  Two tests are used for evalua-
tion of the ability of isolated fungi to hydrolyze and remove oil in efﬂ  uents. 
The ﬁ  rst test involved a study of lipase and β-oxidation activities with a syn-
thetic medium containing 2% soybean oil as a sole source of carbon (Kou et al., 1983). Yeast strains are inoculated and incubated with shaking at 30°C. After 7 days, the hexane extracts of the broth are measured for weight, acid value, and saponiﬁ  cation value. The residual free fatty acids and residual 
glycerides are calculated using equations (Japan Oil Chemists Society, 1971; Harada, 1986). A second test is employed to evaluate differences in hexane extract removal rates between soybean oil manufacturing plant wastewater and two synthetic media, one containing soybean oil and the other containing linoleic acid (the main component of soybean oil).
2.3.5.3 Bioreactors.  Nine strains of yeasts are isolated from decomposing 
oil to treat soybean oil wastewater without pretreatment (Chigusa et al., 1996). An enrichment culture technique is employed for the isolation of yeasts. Of these yeast strains, seven belong to Candida  genus, which is also 
selected as a high producer of lipase (Chen et al., 1990). N1 and N9 strains remove 65% and 78% of hexane extracts, respectively, as well as 94% of glycerides. This results in lower β-oxidation activity than lipase activity. On 
the other hand, seven other yeast strains exhibit higher β-oxidation activity. 
However, the mixture of all nine strains is superior to any single strain in both β-oxidation capability and lipase activity. Synergism is also noted in mixed 
strains of oil-decomposing yeasts. The removal rates are lowered in the order linoleic acid, soybean oil, raw wastewater. The optimal temperature range of yeast treatment in hexane extracts was 30 to 35°C and pH 2.5 to 6.5. A labora-tory-scale reactor with a 50-L tank was inoculated with all oil-decomposing yeasts at 25°C without pH control. The reactor removed more than 98% of h e x a n e  e x t r a c t s  o f  t h e  w a s t e w a t e r  f r o m  a  d a i l y  l o a d  o f  0 . 5  k g  o f  h e x a n e  extracts per kilogram of yeast and about 150 mg/l of hexane extracts remains. An activated sludge process was used as an aftertreatment to meet the sea target level of 30 mg/l at the time of design of the pilot plant (Chigusa et al., 1989).
Table 2.2 shows a ﬂ  owsheet and operating conditions for a pilot plant used 
in the treatment of soybean oil wastewater for one year (Chigusa et al., 1996). The yeast reactor tank removes 99% of oils using isolated yeasts. The acti-vated sludge process further treated the yeast-treated water and the hexane extract was reduced to 2 mg/l for discharge to the sea. Soybean oil decomposi-tion by isolated yeasts without a dissolved ﬂ  otation unit was demonstrated. 
The relationship between the quality of yeast-treated water and hexane extract loading shows the stability of the treated water at 100 mg/l within the range 0.30 to 0.75 kg of hexane extract per kilogram of yeast per day. Similar results have been achieved by yeast treatment in the dried food and ﬁ  sh meal indus-
tries (Tosaki et al., 1991; Nawamura et al., 1992). During pilot-plant opera-tion, the yeast ﬂ  ora detect Candida hellenica , the most dominate species, FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 45TABLE 2.2 Flowsheet and Operating Conditions of a Pilot Plant for the Treatment of Soybean Oil Wastewater

46followed by C. schatavii  and C. ﬂ uviatilis . These species grow, forming 
mycelia/pseudomycelia, and become intertwined to form pellets. Such inter-twined pellets of mycelia show a better sedimentation rate and can stabilize water quality in the yeast treatment. In addition, all strains in the reactor tank metabolize oil by a tricarboxylic acid cycle in which organic matter is oxidized and has a low fermenting ability.
Four types of treatments have been performed to study the fermentation 
of POME (Karim and Kamil, 1989): raw POME, boiled POME, raw POME with 5% inoculum of spores or mycelium separately, and boiled POME with 5% inoculum of spores or mycelium separately. More than 95% of the COD (COD 44 and 56 mg/l) was reduced with POME treated with spores or myce-lium of Trichoderma viride  at days 14 and 10 of the incubation period, respec-
tively. This implies more effectiveness of the mycelial treatment in reducing the COD than of the sporal treatment. Biomass recovery with the mycelium and sporal inocula is 1.37 to 1.42 g/l (dry weight) after 10 days and 1.29 to 1.21 g/l (dry weight) after 14 days, respectively. Other researchers obtain better biomass yield on POME using ﬁ  lamentous fungi (Barker and Morgan, 
1981; Suwandi and Mohd, 1984). The crude protein content from the fungal biomass of the treated POME ranges from 37.6 to 40.7% using sporal and mycelial inoculation after 10 and 14 days of incubation, respectively. Thus, fermentation of the POME by T. viride  can be an alternative pretreatment in 
the reduction of the pollution strength of wastewater. In addition, fungus can compete against the indigenous microﬂ  ora in raw POME, resulting in efﬁ  -
cient reduction of COD. Treatment of POME by Yarrowia lipolytica  NCIM 
3589, a marine hydrocarbon-degrading yeast, reduces about 95% of the COD within 2 days (Oswal et al., 2002). A chemical coagulant further reduces the COD. A consortium developed from garden soil shows a clariﬁ  cation of efﬂ  u-
ent and a pH adjustment between 6 and 7. The complete treatment eliminates 99% of the COD, to 1500 mg/l.
2.3.6 Silage Wastewater
2.3.6.1 Background.  During winter, controlled fermentation of crops of 
high moisture content, such as forage maize and grass, leads to the production of silage. Plant juices are expelled from the ensiled crop, and together with surface water, form silage wastewater. The National Rivers Authority (1992) reported silage efﬂ  uent to be 300 times more polluting than raw domestic 
sewage. Snerik et al. (1977) stated four times faster degradation of silage efﬂ uent than sewage and can be 1000 times more potent as a pollutant.
S i l a g e  w a s t e w a t e r  i s  c o n s i d e r e d  a s  o n e  o f  t h e  m o s t  p o t e n t  a g r i c u l t u r a l  
wastes, with a high BOD value. The pH of the silage efﬂ  uent ranges from 3 
to 5 and poses problems of corrosion to concrete and steel. Arnold et al. (2000) noted the compositions of three silage efﬂ  uents. When discharged 
into water bodies, efﬂ  uent 1, the most acidic efﬂ  uent, can decrease pH and 
kill ﬁ  sh and other aquatic species. The impact of such pollution is even higher FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 4748 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
when discharge occurs in small streams with low ﬂ  ow and low dilution rates. 
Scorching of grass or other crops results due to spreading of the efﬂ  uent, 
followed by the depletion of oxygen in the surrounding soil. The efﬂ  uent can 
ﬁ nd its way into the surface water or groundwater. Well-preserved silage 
efﬂ uent can be fed to animals, as it deteriorates in quality rapidly. Patterson 
and Kilpatrick (1991) reported feeding within 3 to 4 days after production or being stored anaerobically. Aerobic treatment of silage efﬂ  uent (Deans 
and Svoboda, 1992; Galanos et al., 1995) results in a reduction in BOD and a change in pH. Farm waste pollution was described by Beck (1989). The application of membrane ﬁ  ltration to silage efﬂ  uent has also been examined 
(Dunlea and Dodd, 1989). This is considered only a part of integrated waste facility treatment.
2.3.6.2 Legislation.  In 1998, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and 
Food (1999) estimated the cutting of 42.3 million tons of forage crops for silage production in the UK, which resulted in an estimate of 2115 million liters of efﬂ  uent. In dry years, efﬂ  uent production is much lower. The variable 
production of efﬂ  uent causes the difference in the number of incidents of total 
agricultural water pollution in wet years (25%) compared to dry years (14%) (Haigh, 1994). Information reveals 114 to 234 pollution incidents of silage efﬂ uent between 1995 and 1998 (UK Environment Agency, 1996, 1997, 1998, 
1999), accounting for 7% of organic pollution incidents. In the UK, ﬁ  nes of 
up to £20 000 or a 3-month prison sentence can be imposed for polluting water courses.
2.3.6.3 Growth of Fungi.  Cultivation of the yeast Torulopsis  (Candida )
glabrata  on grass silage efﬂ  uent leads to an 85% reduction in carbohydrate 
content (Olsen and Pedersen, 1974). However, the yeast is dropped from silage treatment, due to its inability to utilize lactic acid and potential patho-genicity. Malt–yeast extract–sucrose agar (MYSA) is the medium of choice for the enumeration and isolation of fungi from silage (Skaar and Stenwig, 1996). Penicillium roqueforti  is most prevalent on bales of grass silage in 
Ireland and represents 52% of all isolates (O’Brien et al., 2005). Of 11 iso-lates, Candida utilis  and T2B ( Galactomyces geotrichum ) are effective in 
reducing the pollutants of silage efﬂ  uents of variable age and composition 
(Arnold et al., 2000). A COD of 74 to 95% is reduced in all efﬂ  uents, but the 
percentage reduction accounts for 95% in more the dilute and fresher efﬂ  u-
ents (efﬂ  uents 2 and 3) (Table 2.3). Both fungi exhibit TOC removal of 60 to 
87%, with the greatest reduction in efﬂ  uent 2. Both yeasts assimilate both d-
and l-lactic acids. Both yeasts remove 100% of l-lactic acid in 50% and 25% 
silage efﬂ  uents, and both organisms remove 50 to 98% of d-lactic acid in 25% 
efﬂ uent and 90% for C. utilis  and T2B, respectively, in 50% efﬂ  uent. Both 
yeasts reduce varying degree of phenolic compounds in efﬂ  uent 1. The increase 
in pH due to the removal of lactic acids and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) occurs in all treatments. Both yeasts are effective in 82 to 99% removal of phosphate TABLE 2.3 Percentage COD, TOC, and Phosphate Reductions of Silage Efﬂ  uents by T2B and Candida utilis

in both 25% and 50% dilutions of all silage efﬂ  uents. C. utilis  and T2B 
remove about 95 to 100% of acetic and propionic acids and 70 to 100% of the four higher VFAs.
2.3.6.4 On-Farm Treatment.  The feasibility of a simple on-farm treatment 
process of silage efﬂ  uent is presented by the addition of a large inoculum of 
y e a s t  f o ll o w e d  b y  vi g o r o u s  a e r a t i o n  ( Arn o l d  e t  al . ,  2000).  Th e  d o min a t in g  yeast T2B can survive and compete easily with the native microﬂ  ora. The 
higher reductions in COD and TOC indicate the use of a yeast treatment process to protect human health and the environment. However, the process may not reduce the residual COD in the efﬂ  uent sufﬁ  ciently to discharge the 
efﬂ uent to a water course. Further treatment is required before ﬁ  nal direct 
discharge. Biomass produced during this process can be considered for use as a fertilizer or soil conditioner.
2.3.6.5 Production of Fungal Biomass.   The protein content for C. utilis
is 160 mg/g dry weight and for T2B is 74 mg/g (Arnold et al., 2000). Elemental analyses of the biomass grown on efﬂ  uent 2 result in higher concentrations 
of P and Ca in T2B than in C. utilis  and very much higher concentrations of 
K in C. utilis  than in T2B. In both yeasts, glutamate accounts for the highest 
amount: ca. 12 to 17 mol%. Alanine, leucine, and glycine each account for ca. 10% of the total amino acid content. Besides the low protein content, biomass reveals a good amino acid proﬁ  le for use as an animal feed supplement.
2.3.7 Acidogenic Wastewater
2.3.7.1 Background.  Highly loaded efﬂ  uents containing 45% of the total 
organic industrial pollution are produced by the food industry. These efﬂ  u-
ents contain high concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), whose treat-m e n t  r e q u i r e s  m a n y  s u c c e s s i v e  s t e p s .  T o  d e g r a d e  t h e  h i g h l y  c o n c e n t r a t e d  biodegradable contaminants, Laulan (1987) revealed that a yeast reactor, fol-lowed by an anaerobic bacteria reactor in series, can satisfy the efﬂ  uent dis-
charge requirements. A yeast reactor is known to be prone to contamination by bacteria, and an anaerobic bioreactor usually requires a long retention time. Elmaleh et al. (1996) proposed an alternative process of acidogenic reactor in series followed by a yeast reactor. This operational setup provides shorter retention times in the acidogenic reactor. The operation of the follow-ing yeast reactor can be performed at low pH to limit contamination by bac-teria. Anaerobic acidogenesis of a complex wastewater has been discussed (Dinoupoulou et al., 1988). The main organic compounds include VFAs such as acetic acid, propionic acid, or butyric acid. Elmaleh et al. (1995) reported efﬂ uents produced by the organic chemical industry that contain a highly 
concentrated acetic acid solution. The synthetic efﬂ  uent is composed of acetic 
acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, or a mixture of these acids and is employed as a sole source of carbon in the yeast reactor (Elmaleh et al., 1999). Maugeri and Goma (1980) overviewed the single-cell protein (SCP) production from 
organic acids with Candida utilis .
2.3.7.2 Bioreactors and Modeling.  A process using an anaerobic acido-
genic reactor followed by a yeast ( C. utilis ) reactor in series to treat highly 
concentrated efﬂ  uents is shown in Figure 2.3 (Elmaleh et al., 1999). The pilot 
units consist of two perfectly mixed reactors in series. The ﬁ  rst comprises a 
60-L mechanically stirred anaerobic acidogenic reactor, thermoregulated at 35°C and operated at a retention time of 35 hours. Its pH is maintained at 6

to prevent product inhibition or lactic fermentation (Edeline, 1993). The fol-
lowing 16-L yeast reactor, also known as a pilot reactor, is receiving the efﬂ  u-
ent from the acidogenic reactor. Its pH is regulated at 3.5 and operated at 18 to 20°C. The pilot reactor is stirred mechanically at 600 rpm. Oxygen moni-toring shows an oxygen concentration of higher than 80 to 90% of the satura-tion concentration. In a laboratory reactor, about 97% TOC (Table 2.4) is removed for all the organic acids and mixtures of different proportions (Elmaleh et al., 1999). The same is true for the pilot yeast reactor fed with acetic acid. Edeline (1993) reported 95% removal of VFAs if the acidogenic process is optimized in the pilot unit. The pilot reactor shows 87% TOC reduction when it is fed exclusively with the acidogenic reactor efﬂ  uent. About 
90% TOC is removed by two reactors in series and remains steady during a 6-month operation.
The growth kinetics of C. utilis  on acetic acid has been studied in a labora-
tory reactor under both batch and continuous conditions (Elmaleh et al., 1996, 1999). In a batch reactor, the rate of growth gradually increases until acetate exhaustion. In a steady-state continuous reactor, the substrate is exhausted and the rate of growth depends on the concentration of residual acetic acid. A signiﬁ  cant uncoupling between growth and substrate utilization 
is found in the batch reactor, and the transient state of the continuously stirred-tank reactor cannot be predicted. This implies the metabolic state of the yeast sensitive to substrate inhibition effects in a steady-state perfectly mixed reactor at low substrate concentration.
A Haldane-type inhibition model is proposed to describe the growth of C.
utilis  on sodium acetate as a sole source of carbon and energy (Cama and 
Edwards, 1970). Ko and Edwards (1975) employed a model to calculate the growth inhibition of C. utilis  at high acetate concentrations. Jackson and 
Edwards (1975) used a model to incorporate the pH effects to model the speciﬁ  c growth rate of C. utilis  on acetate. Assimilation of acetic acid by C.
utilis  is also proposed by an equation (Maugeri, 1980). Defrance (1993) inves-
tigated the performance and limitations of a yeast reactor for the treatment of wastes in the food industry and suggested an empirical equation to describe the growth inhibition of C. utilis  on acetic acid. His model accounts for a

observed. The critical substrate concentration is important for the design of a culture reactor in the presence of inhibitory substrates such as VFAs. However, little is known about models describing the degradation of other VFAs using yeasts. The kinetic behavior and mathematical modeling of C.
utilis  on butyric acid and ammoniac-nitrogen (NH
4+—N) for the removal of 
carbon and nitrogen from wastewater have been described (Ortiz et al., 1997). The culture apparatus consists of cultivation in a 2-L Biolaﬁ  tte fermentor 
containing 1.5 L of aerated Henry’s medium mixed at 800 rpm. The data are ﬁ tted to the models using Bio-ASPRO, a software tool designed for biopro-
cess modeling and control. The maximum growth rate on butyric acid is optimal at 4.86 g/l, and the strongest inhibition occurs at 12.82 g/l. Acid inhibi-tion is due to uncoupling of the pH gradient by passive diffusion across the cell membrane (Herrero, 1983) and acidiﬁ  cation of the cytoplasm (Lawford 
and Rousseau, 1993). A concentration of 0.52 g/l of NH
4+—N produces 
maximum yield (0.61 g/l) and productivity (0.57 g/l·h). Growth-limiting con-ditions occur at 0.81 g/l of undissociated butyric acid and 0.08 g/l of NH
4+—N. 
Conversion of acid and NH 4+—N into biomass is possible at their respective 
low concentrations in a reactor. Construction of a general expression to model the speciﬁ  c growth rate has been developed. More or less similar results in 
batch reactors depicting incomplete inhibition of the yeast growth using acetic acid as substrate with concentrations from 0.44 to 26.46 g/l at pH 6.0 and 30°C have been shown by Maugeri (1980). The undissociated acid concentration is 1.57 g/l from the total acetic acid concentration of 26.46 g/l. The undissociated acid concentration of the mixture (acetic, propionic, and butyric acids) is 2.4 g/l from a total mixture concentration of 40 g/l. The threshold inhibition values are two to three times higher than the threshold recorded by Ortiz et al. (1997). C. utilis  shows more sensitivity to the undissociated acid concentra-
tion than other species of Candida  and species of Schizosaccharomyces .
2.3.8 Olive Mill Wastewater
2.3.8.1 Background.  Olives in Mediterranean countries, constitute about 
98% of global production. Large quantities of olive mill wastewater (OMW) are produced during the manufacture of oil by traditional mill and press processes. This wastewater arises from the vegetation water of olives, washing and process water, and soft tissues from the olive pulp and oil, and forms a stable emulsion. Borja et al. (1992) reported a release of 2.5 L of waste per liter of oil produced. About 1 to 2 tons of OMW is produced during the pro-duction of 1 ton of olives (Garcia et al., 2000). In addition to its high polluting power, OMW usually exhibits a high level of phytotoxic and antibacterial activity, due to the presence of various phenolic compounds. Balice et al. (1988) reported that the antimicrobial qualities of OMW must be diluted prior to treatment, but that a strain of Aspergillus niger  remains unaffected 
by the toxic substances in the OMW.FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 5354 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
Conventional methods are not effective in the treatment of OMW. A good 
degree of success is achieved through the use of an electrolysis system (Israilides et al., 1997). Besides some advantages of previous work, the anaer-obic digestion of OMW was accompanied by problems of high toxicity, low biodegradability of the efﬂ  uent, and acidiﬁ  cation of reactors. The presence 
of phenolic compounds slows the process, removal of part of the COD, and its economic viability. Aerobic biological methods appear to be suitable because these treatments tend to diminish the phenol content and reduce toxicity. Vitolo et al. (1999) discussed the treatment of olive oil wastes. Evapo-ration is used to separate the vegetation water into an aqueous liquid that can be puriﬁ  ed by a biological process, and a residue where 98% of the organic 
load is concentrated.
Since the OMW contains the phenolics, tannin, and lignin, attention is 
focused on microorganisms capable of degrading such compounds. Many soil- and litter-inhabiting bacteria and fungi can partly degrade these compounds. Their metabolism leads to the formation of low-molecular-weight aromatic compounds that are found in OMW, and these can be further degraded. Species of Aspergillus ,Geotrichum , and Phanerochaete  possess high activi-
ties of catabolic enzymes and can utilize a wide variety of simple aromatic compounds. Microbial composition of OMW from four disposal ponds led to the identiﬁ  cation of several species of bacteria, yeasts, and molds (Millan et 
al., 2000). Besides other species of fungi, strains of Fusarium ,Paecilomyces ,
Penicillium , and Scopulariopsis  exhibited a marked capacity for the detoxiﬁ  -
cation of OMW, removing its antibacterial activity completely.
2.3.8.2 Composition and Characteristics.  Garcia et al. (2000) obtained 
OMW from a continuous olive-processing operation that contained a COD of 82 000 mg/l and a total phenol content of 1200 mg/l. The composition of OMW varies widely depending on the type of process (batch or continuous) involved in obtaining oil. The compositions of the OMW have also been fea-tured (Martin et al., 1991; Vassilev et al., 1997; Fountoulakis et al., 2002). A phenolic content of 1.2 to 10 g/l is reported by some researchers (Moreno et al., 1987; Vinciguerra et al., 1995; D’Annibale et al., 1999). The debittering process of green olives (GOW) also produces wastewater rich in polypheno-lics, high COD, and alkalinity (Aggelis et al., 2002).
2.3.8.3 Fermentation.  Fungal fermentation of the OMW is noted in Table 
2.5. Phanerochaete ﬂ  avido-alba  decolorizes OMW in static or semistatic cul-
tures at 30°C (Blanquez et al., 2002). The experiments were conducted in a Bioﬂ o III bioreactor. The toxicity of the culture medium was eliminated up to 
70%, as determined by a Microtox system. The fungus produces manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) and laccase, which are able to decolorize and reduce the aromatic compounds and toxicity simultaneously. A strain of Pha-
nerochaete chrysosporium  isolated from Moroccan OMW has the ability to 
degrade OMW under different culture conditions (Kissi et al., 2001). P. TABLE 2.5 Fungal Fermentation of Olive Mill Wastewater

chrysosporium  eliminates more than 50% of the color and phenols from 
OMW within 6 days, compared to similar results reached in 12 days by Pleu-
rotus ostreatus . Of seven strains of Penicillium  isolated from wastewater dis-
posal ponds, strain P4 produces the best biomass: 21.5 g dry weight per liter on undiluted OMW after 20 days (Robles et al., 2000). This and other strains eliminate a high amount of COD and phenolic content of OMW and cause an increase in pH.
Of eight white-rot fungi, P. ostreatus shows a high decolorization efﬁ  ciency 
of 49% (Aggelis et al., 2002). All fungi reveal the highest activity of laccase, followed by manganese-independent peroxidase (MIP). Substantial MnP activity is found only in GOW treated with P. ostreatus  and Abortiporus 
biennis ; LiP and veratryl alcohol oxidase (VAOx) are not detected. Early 
detection of laccase activity correlates with the ﬁ  nal amount of reduction of 
total phenolics. MnP is necessary for efﬁ  cient decolorization. Pycnosporus 
coccineus ,Pleurotus sajor-caju ,Coriolopsis polyzona , and Lentinus (Len-
tinula )tigrinus  were good in decolorization and COD removal of crude olive 
mill wastewaters diluted to 50 and 75 g/l after 20 days (Jaouani et al., 2003). P. sajor-caju  and C. polyzona sho w ed 72 to 7 5 % decoloriza tion of e fﬂ  uent 
diluted to 50 g/l COD. Different mechanisms seemed to be involved, due to differences in enzyme activity. Panus tigrinus  efﬁ ciently removed phenols, 
color, and organic load from OMW at an initial soluble COD value of 43 000 mg/l (D’ Annibale et al., 2004b).
Aerobic pretreatment of OMW with P. chrysosporium  reduces the 
phenolics and toxic aromatic compounds followed by anaerobic treatment (Gharsallah et al., 1999). Pretreatment of crude OMW by P. chrysosporium
reduced the COD from 107 g/l to 55 g/l and to 85 g/l after sedimentation. About 70% of color and 80% of COD were removed when the cultures were supplemented with veratryl alcohol and ﬂ  ushed with oxygen (Sayadi and 
Ellouz, 1992). Glutamate suppresses the biodegradation system. Decoloriza-tion by Aspergillus niger  occurs due to fungal adsorption, including 55.5% 
degradation of phenols and 73.5% degradation of tannins (Hamdi et al., 1991a). A. niger  removed 61.6% COD in ﬂ  asks and 52.5% in a fermentor after 
72 hours. Hamdi et al. (1991b) optimized fermentation by A. niger . The 
highest biomass and greatest COD removal were obtained with a ratio of COD removed to N : SO
4 of 100 to 3 : 1.5. The fungus fermented the OMW 
without dilution. A novel method combining a strain of A. niger  and electro-
chemical treatment in the presence of H 2O2 has been developed for the treat-
ment of green table olive–processing wastewater (Kyriacou et al., 2005). The fungal treatment removed the COD and selected phenols by 66 to 86% and 65%, respectively. Nearly 96% COD and measured phenols were eliminated during electrochemical treatment with 2.5% H
2O2. The pilot plant removed 
75% COD with 1.6% H 2O2. Coagulation with Ca(OH) 2 led to 98% overall 
removal efﬁ  ciency for the combined treatment.
The phenol detoxifying activity of P. ostreatus  is concomitant with increas-
ing phenol oxidase production (Martirani et al., 1996). The phenol oxidase activity was 1.1 U/ml (ﬁ  rst cycle), 2.0 U/ml (second cycle), and 2.6 U/ml (third 
cycle) after 70 hours of each cycle. Four species of Pleurotus  produced a high 
yield of fruiting bodies under certain conditions (Sanjust et al., 1991). Species of Pleurotus produced large amounts of laccase in the medium, thus signiﬁ  -
cantly reducing the concentration of phenolics and other toxic compounds. A highly signiﬁ  cant correlation between color reduction, TOC, and total phenols 
using Lentinus (Lentinula ) edodes  has been noted (Vinciguerra et al., 1995). 
NMR analysis conﬁ  rms bioconversion of phenolic and aliphatic compounds 
in the form of signals of metabolic products due to activity of the fungus. Exoenzyme production such as phenol oxidase was maximum after 7 days and MnP was detected on the seventh day. Such results conﬁ  rm involvement 
of the lignin-degrading system of the fungus.
2.3.8.4 Modeling.  Fermentation follows Monod kinetics either on COD or 
TOC as the substrate and produces values for maximum speciﬁ  c growth and 
growth yield (Garcia et al., 2000). A comparison among various fungi using kinetic information indicated the removal of phenolic compounds from OMW in the sequence P. chrysosporium >A. niger >A. terreus . A kinetic study was 
conducted of the anaerobic digestion of OMW previously fermented with Geotrichum candidum ,Azotobacter chroococcum , and Aspergillus terreus
(Borja et al., 1995). A batch-fed bioreactor containing sepiolite was employed as a supporting material for the mediating bacteria. The anaerobic process followed the ﬁ  rst-order kinetics. The kinetic constant increased with a 
decrease in phenolic compound content and biotoxicity of the pretreated OMWs. The yield coefﬁ  cient was 260 (untreated OMW), 300 ( Geotrichum -
pretreated OMW), 315 ( Azotobacter -pretreated OMW), and 350 ( Aspergillus -
pretreated OMW) ml of CH
4 STP per gram of COD. Borja et al. (1993) also 
described kinetic study of OMW previously fermented aerobically with A. 
terreus using the same bioreactor and method. The process exhibited no 
inhibition phenomena, and the total phenolic compounds and biotoxicity was reduced by 94.3% and 86.8%, respectively. An average removal of COD frac-tion was 70%, and the yield coefﬁ  cient was 349 ml of CH
4 STP per gram of 
COD, 30% higher than for untreated OMW.
2.3.8.5 Immobilization.  Immobilized bioreactors for the decolorization of 
the OMW are listed in Table 2.6. OMW has been decolorized by agitated submerged cultures of free and immobilized P. chrysosporium  (Sayadi et al., 
1996). No decolorization of OMW was found when P. chrysosporium  was 
grown in the form of pellets. Decolorization was obtained after removing the high-molecular-weight polyphenolic fraction ( >60 kDa) by ultraﬁ  ltration. The 
highest decolorization (85%) and COD removal (50%) occurred in a medium producing high lignin peroxidase (LiP). Extensive depolymerization and sub-sequent accumulation of phenolics of intermediate molecular weight were found. The application of P. chrysosporium  immobilized on polyurethane 
foam in repeated batches resulted in more than 70% color and COD removals FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 57TABLE 2.6 Immobilized Bioreactors for Decolorization of Olive Mill Wastewater

without sporulation or lysis. OMW was treated by immobilized cells of Asper-
gillus niger  in polyurethane sponge cubes to produce a material of low toxicity 
and its enrichment with soluble rock phosphate (RP) to formulate a suitable process for fertilizer (Vassilev et al., 1997). Three types of medium were studied: OMW + N, OMW + N + RP, and OMW + RP. Five-cycle repeated 
batch fermentation process indicated the production of the highest fungal biomass of 5.32 g per gram of carrier on a medium containing both N and RP. Reduction of phenols was registered in all treatments. Vassilev et al. (1996) reported the inﬂ  uence of the buffering capacity of RP on the acid-producing 
activity of immobilized Penicillium variable  P16. RP solubilized with a 
maximum level of soluble P of 0.58 g/l during the fourth batch cycle of the OMW + RP treatment. This application results in three types of waste liquid 
that can be used further for various purposes.
Laccase of Lentinula edodes  immobilized on chitosan by adsorption and 
subsequent cross-linking with glutarldehyde eliminated total phenols and ortho -phenols by 67% and 72%, respectively, after 24 hours (D’Annibale 
et al., 1999). Removal of the para -substituents 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 
4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid occurred at a slower rate than the removal of ortho -diphenolic compounds. Treatment on six consecutive batches showed 
signiﬁ  cant removal of color, total phenols, and ortho -phenols. Signiﬁ  cant 
regain (60%) of the immobilized activity was restored by washing the column with three bed volumes of 0.1 M McIllvaine buffer, suggesting the possibility of further use of the immobilized catalyst. Oxirane-immobilized Lentinula edodes  laccase treatment operated in a batch recirculation mode 
removed about 70% of total phenols, 88% of ortho -phenols, and 22% 
de colorization of the OMW in 2 hours (D’ Annibale et al., 2000). Less than 5% of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol, catechol, 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid was recovered from the OMW. The dephenolization efﬁ  ciency in a ﬂ  uidized-bed 
bioreactor was reduced in successive batches and was restored using acetate buffer.
2.3.8.6 Enzyme Treatment.  A reduction in total phenolics exceeded 50% 
during treatment of GOW with puriﬁ  ed laccase from Polyporus pensitius
(Aggelis et al., 2002). This was not followed by a decline in phytotoxicity. This may be attributed to the formation of phenoxy radicals and quinonoids, which repolymerize in the absence of VAOx. OMW was treated with puriﬁ  ed phenol 
oxidase from Pleurotus ostreatus  (Martirani et al., 1996). Incubation of OMW 
with different amounts of phenol oxidase catalyzed in an undetectable trans-formation. This can be attributed to the fact that these wastewaters exist in the form of a suspension, rather than in a solution consisting of insoluble heterogeneous polymers such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, or phenol polymers (Sainz-Jimenez and Gomez-Alarcon, 1986). The raw OMW inhib-ited the activity of phenol oxidase by adsorption or binding to polymeric FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 5960 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS
substances. Treatment of ultraﬁ  ltered OMW with polyphenol oxidase reduced 
90% of phenolic compounds compared to untreated OMW.
Lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) of Phanero-
chaete chrysosporium  contribute to decolorization of OMW (Sayadi and 
Ellouz, 1995). About 25% of the OMW was decolorized when P. chrysospo-
rium  grows in the presence of a high Mn(II) concentration in which a high 
level of MnP (0.65 μM) is produced. More than 70% of the OMW was decol-
orized when P. chrysosporium  grows in the presence of a low Mn(II) concen-
tration that results in a high level of LiP (0.3 μM). The highest levels of OMW 
decolorization occurred at a low initial COD level in conjunction with high levels of extracellular LiP. The positive effect of veratryl alcohol on LiP activ-ity indicates the high levels of OMW decolorization.
Potential applications of oxidative enzymes and phenol oxidase–like com-
pounds in wastewater treatment have been described (Duran and Esposito, 2000). A reduction in treatment cost can be achieved through enzyme immo-bilization. Tyrosinase catalyzed the hydroxylation of phenols and dehydroge-nation of ortho -diphenols, which can result in excellent removal of phenols in 
an immobilized form. Laccase eliminated phenols through a polymerization process. Peroxidases, including lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxi-dase (MnP), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), were also discussed.
2.3.8.7 Toxicity Testing.  Some aspects of toxicity after fungal treatment 
have been discussed in the foregoing paragraphs. No difference in toxicity was found when tested on Bacillus cereus  due to phenol oxidase treatment of 
OMW, despite a 90% reduction in phenolic compounds (Martirani et al., 1996). This could be due to the formation of reaction products of phenol oxidase: for example, oxidative coupling polymers and quinonoids, which are more inhibiting than the original substances. Capasso et al. (1995) reported the generation of ortho -benzoquinone by laccase-catalyzed oxidation of 
catechol, which completely inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas syringae
pv. savastanoi  and Corynebacterium michiganense  at 500 μM concentration. 
However, antibacterial activity was expressed by OMW on these bacteria up to a dilution of 1 : 4.
The soil nitrogen-ﬁ  xing bacterium Rhizobium  sp. strain 1230 has also been 
employed to test toxicity before and after the treatment of OMW with immo-bilized laccase for 6 and 24 hours (D’Annibale et al., 1999). The experiments indicated growth suppression of this strain in a 1 : 4 dilution of OMW. The growth suppressive effect was also found at 1 : 8 diluted OMW without laccase treatment, and this effect was removed by laccase incubation for 24 hours before dilution. Borja et al. (1997) related the impact of selected phenolics from OMW toward the kinetics of acetoclastic methanogenesis to the molecu-lar structure of phenols. Higher inhibitory effects of ortho -phenols were 
exhibited than for para -coumaric and para -hydroxybenzoic acids. A higher 
degree of toxicity was expressed by cinnamic acid derivatives than by benzoic acid derivatives. However, D’ Annibale et al. (1999) demonstrated the highest removal rates of ortho -phenols and the cinnamic acid derivative para -
coumaric acid by immobilized laccase from Lentinula edodes , causing reduced 
toxicity of OMW. L. edodes  removed phenols from OMW and signiﬁ  cantly 
reduced the OMW phytotoxicity, as shown by durum wheat ( Triticum durum
Desf.) germinability (D’ Annibale et al., 2004a). The toxicity of pretreated OMW could be attributed to the concentration of high-molecular-weight aromatics, which remained high after fungal treatment (Gharsallah et al., 1999). Thus, OMW can be used in agriculture after the removal of phytotoxic effects.
Phytotoxicity was not eliminated during treatment of GOW by Pleurotus 
ostreatus  despite a 76% reduction of the phenolics (Aggelis et al., 2002). 
Fermentation of OMW with Penicillium P4 caused no antibacterial activity 
against Bacillus megaterium  ATCC 25848 (Robles et al., 2000). The toxicity 
of the OMW was determined by a luminescent bacteria Photobacterium 
phosphoreum  test using a Microtox system (Borja et al., 1993). The EC
50 was 
1.24 (toxic units 80.8) prior to inoculation with Aspergillus and 9.43 (toxic 
units 10.6) upon fermentation. Phanerochaete ﬂ  avido-alba  reduced the phenol 
and lipid contents of semisolid olive mill waste mixtures and pine-chip mix-tures, resulting in a substrate with lower antibacterial and phytotoxic effects (Linares et al., 2003).
2.3.8.8 Economic Importance.  During the past two decades, a number of 
fungi have been studied for converting OMW into new value-added products (Table 2.7). One of them is the production of single-cell protein (SCP) from olive black water. OMW as raw material for SCP using A. niger  under non-
optimized conditions has been evaluated (Hamdi et al., 1991a). The soluble protein in the ﬁ  ltrate from ﬂ  asks and a fermentor was 3.75 g/l and 4.95 g/l, 
respectively. A good prospect exists for the exploitation of OMWs for mush-room cultivation (Zervakis et al., 1996). Some important characteristics of mushroom cultivation, such as earliness, quality of basidiomata, and yield, were noted. The optimal concentration of OMW for mycelia growth of Pleu-
rotus  was assessed for the production of biomass in liquid media.

An approach to the use of OMW as a fertilizer (Lombardo, 1988) and to 
formulate a process for OMW-based fertilizer production (Vassilev et al., 1997) has been suggested. Aerobic bioremediation of OMW can produce high-quality compost containing a good supply of nutrients (Tomati et al., 1996). Biomethanation was inhibited during the anaerobic digestion of OMW prefermented with P. chrysosporium  at a low hydraulic loading rate 
(Gharsallah et al., 1999). Biogas produced by thermally processed OMW with P. ostreatus  was higher than that produced by raw and thermally processed 
OMW, respectively (Fountoulakis et al., 2002). OMW was also used as a growth medium for the production of laccase and MnP from Panus tigrinus 
CBS 577.79 (Fenice et al., 2003). Solid-state fermentation was more suitable than submerged fermentation. The highest levels of laccase and MnP were achieved in a stirred-tank reactor (4600 ± 98 U/l on day 13) and in an airlift 
reactor (410 ± 22 U/l on day 7), respectively.
2.4 BIOTECHNOLOGY
Microorganisms exist in nature as members of complex and mixed communi-
ties. In industrial wastewater bioreactors, microorganisms can be employed as model systems to understand the evolution of new metabolic pathways in natural ecosystems. In general, a wastewater bioreactor is geared to a process that dictates the chemical composition of the waste stream. A unique ecosys-tem evolves over time to degrade the components of a particular stream. For example, a bioreactor for starch processing will be enriched with starch degraders, whereas the bioreactors of acidogenic efﬂ  uents will be enriched 
with acidogenic degraders. Modiﬁ  cation of the processes contributes to a 
change of components of the waste stream that causes the microorganisms in the bioreactor to adapt. This microbial diversity in a bioreactor leads to the development of new metabolic pathways (Bramucci and Nagarajan, 2000).
A wide variety of engineering parameters are regularly monitored during 
operation of wastewater bioreactors. However, the microorganisms in biore-actors have never been well characterized. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁ  c a t i o n  o f  1 6 S  r R N A  g e n e  s e q u e n c e s  i s  u s e d  t o  d e t e c t  t h e  b a c t e r i a l  
diversity in ecosystems. Similar approaches have been employed to study the structure and activities of microbial population in wastewater bioreactors (Amann et al., 1998; Oerther et al., 2000). The microbial population in a wastewater bioreactor can be characterized by two approaches: inoculating a variety of cultures with sludge from the bioreactor, and establishment of enriched cultures by inoculating samples of sludge into a minimal salts medium supplemented with a single aromatic compound (e.g., benzene, phenol) as a sole source of carbon and energy. PCR ampliﬁ  cation of 16S 
rRNA is performed on bacterial isolates from standard microbiological media and enrichment cultures. Based on the similarity with 16S rRNA from the GenBank database, the isolates are assigned to groups or species. Bramucci REFERENCES 63
and Nagarajan (2000) assigned 27 groups or species based on a bacteriai 
culture from a wastewater bioreactor on standard microbiological media, isolated additional bacteria from enrichment cultures, and tested the meta-bolic and genetic diversity from enrichment cultures. A phylogenetic tree d e ri v e d  fr o m  1 6S  r RN A  g e n e  s e q u e n ce  d a ta  f o r  b a ct e ri a  cul tur e d  fr o m  an  industrial wastewater bioreactor has also been constructed and aligned. Bacteria with novel metabolic pathways are also identiﬁ  ed. Use of genomic 
technology can develop novel biocatalysts useful for industrial wastewater bioreactors. Unfortunately, at present, most work is focused on bacteria rather than fungi.
2.5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The use of fungi in wastewater treatment is not new or old. It is correct that 
there are many types of wastewaters that cannot be degraded by fungi or may be a ttribu ted to the slo w gro wth of fungi or the difﬁ  culty of using them in 
bioreactors. With the advent of new manufacturing products, new types of wastewaters will be produced and may be amenable to degradation by fungi. It is also important to identify and characterize fungal communities already present in wastewater bioreactors related to different types of waste streams.
Various types of bioreactors have been established in the treatment of 
wastewaters by fungi. In certain cases, fermentation models to predict the performance of a system under various operating conditions are known. A wide scope exists for the use of computer models based on different operating parameters. Enzyme treatment has already opened a door for the treatment of wastewaters, but more needs to be accomplished. The use of immobilized fungal cells or enzymes in beads or carriers has already achieved good success and reduced the treatment cost. Wastewater utilization concomitant with the production of value-added products is quite attractive. Several types of waste-water processing industries have installed such processes at their facilities. Nutrient supplementation(s) may be required. Such processes have been pat-ented. New products, including enzymes, are being produced to offset the treatment cost of certain wastewaters.

FUNGAL TREATMENT OF 
DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Distillery wastewater is produced as a result of distillation of ethanol pro-
duced in the fermentation of carbohydrates, which pose considerable prob-l e m s  i n  d i s p o s a l  o r  t r e a t m e n t .  V a r i o u s  t y p e s  o f  r a w  m a t e r i a l s ,  s u c h  a s  sugarcane, beet, grains, and fruit, are being employed for the production of ethanol in these industries. The alcohol can be produced from four types of raw materials (e.g., sugar crops, starch crops, dairy products, and cellulose materials). For every liter of ethanol produced, up to 20 L of stillage is gener-ated (Guruswami, 1988; Algur and Gokalp, 1991; van Haandel and Catunda, 1994). In a typical distillery, over a half million liters of stillage is generated every day. Lele et al. (1989) calculated the pollution level of stillage as being equivalent to the sewage of a city with a population of 500 000.
The most easily fermentable raw materials are derived from sugar-based 
crops such as sugar beet and sugarcane molasses. However, the sugar industry produces several grades of blackstrap molasses, depending on the sugar and ash contents and color. In 1995 there were 250 distilleries in India, producing 1.1 billion liters of ethanol from sugarcane molasses (Singh and Nigam, 1995). In Brazil, the production of ethanol was 16.2 billion liters in 1997, about 79% produced from sugarcane juice and 21% from molasses by-product (DNDE, 1998). In the United States, 57 facilities produced an estimated 6.9 billion liters of ethanol in 1999 (Wilkie et al., 2000). In Japan, the output of Shochu

3× 108 L since 1986 (Kida et al., 1995). However, the production of stillage 
varies depending on the raw materials and ethanol production processes.
Molasses spent wash (MSW) acts as a water pollutant in many ways. One 
of the important features of molasses spent wash is its dark brown color. The color components disrupt the ﬂ  ow of penetration of sun rays in surface 
waters, which in turn reduces the photosynthetic activity and is detrimental to aquatic life. The high COD load results in eutrophication of contaminated waterways. Such discharge can also increase the temperature of the receiving waters, thus reducing the amount of dissolved oxygen content. In addition, an acidic efﬂ  uent decreases the pH by dissolving some metals in ﬂ  owing water. 
Disposal on land is equally hazardous, as it reduces the soil alkalinity and manganese availability, inhibits seed germination, and destroys crops and vegetation.
Little is known as to the ﬁ  nal disposition of stillage and treated stillage 
efﬂ uents. In Brazil, methods have been developed for the utilization of stillage 
nutrients and land application of untreated stillage on sugarcane ﬁ  elds (de 
Menezes, 1989). Treatment options are being considered for decolorization, odor control, and nutrient removal prior to acceptable discharge into surface water or any other water body. The long-term impact on the agronomic prop-erties of soils of discharge of treated or untreated stillage efﬂ  uents requires 
further study.
3.2 COMPOSITION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF STILLAGE
Molasses stillage has a high ash content, low pH, high concentration of mineral 
salts, and a BOD range of 45 to 65 g/dm
3 (Algur and Gokalp, 1991). The high 
BOD value is attributed to the use of 90% or more of the organic, nonfer-mentable raw material that ends up as waste from the process. Shochu  dis-
tillery wastewater contains suspended solids of 40 000 to 50 000 mg/l and a h i g h  B O D  c o n c e n t r a t i o n  o f  4 0  0 0 0  t o  8 0  0 0 0  m g / l  ( K i d a  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 5 ) .  T h e  composition of sugar beet and sugarcane molasses stillage includes various organic compounds, including acetic acid, lactic acid, glycerol, and reducing sugars. The calcium, magnesium, and ortho -phosphate contents in sugarcane 
stillage are much higher than in sugar beet stillage. The COD/organic dry matter ratio in sugarcane stillage is 1.3 times greater than in sugar beet still-age (Baerwald and Lee, 1989). FitzGibbon et al. (1995) showed spent wash as a recalcitrant waste with a high COD content of 85 170 mg/l, containing inhibitory phenolic (gallic and vanillic acids) compounds. The MSW is recal-citrant, owing to the presence of melanoidins, and contributes color to the efﬂ uent. These compounds show antioxidant properties, are inhibitory to 
fermentation, and are toxic to many microorganisms present in wastewater treatment processes. An average composition of sugarcane molasses distillery efﬂ uent and sugarcane molasses spent wash from India has been described COMPOSITION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF STILLAGE 7778 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
(Singh and Nigam, 1995; Raghukumar and Rivonkar, 2001). The composition 
of stillages originating from molasses (cane, blackstrap, and beet), grain, malt, cassava, sulﬁ  te waste liquor, wine, and fruit has been proﬁ  led by Friedrich et 
al. (1992). Beet molasses has a COD of 80.5 g/l, Kjeldahl-N of 1.8 g/l, soluble phosphorus of 0.12 g/l, sulfates of 5 g/l, and total phenols of 0.450 g/l (Jimenez et al., 2003).
F e rm e n ta ti o n  o f  m o l asses  wi th  y e as ts  an d  r eﬁ  ning the alcohol produced 
from the fermentation broth by distillation is a common agroindustrial activ-ity throughout the world. This process leaves a residue known as vinasse
which consists of water and nonvolatile components. This wastewater or the spent wash is highly concentrated and contains total dissolved solids (TDS) of 50 000 mg/l and organic matter. The composition of vinasse has been described by many researchers (Garcia et al., 1997; Gonzalez et al., 2000; Jimenez et al., 2005). It is dark in color, with a typical odor and a strongly acidic nature (pH ≅ 3.5), and its organic COD content is high between 10 and 
80 g/l. The highest levels of BOD, COD, COD/BOD ratio, phosphorus, and sulfate are found in sugarcane molasses stillage; low levels of COD and BOD are noted in sugarcane juice stillage (Wilkie et al., 2000). The common guppy Lebistes reticulatus  has been used in the bioassay of distillery efﬂ  uent (Kumar 
et al., 1995).
3.3 ALTERNATIVE INDUSTRIAL STILLAGE 
TREATMENT REACTORS
An understanding of processes that utilize the by-product wastewaters associ-
ated with ethanol production is important for treatment. During the last decade, a considerable amount of research has been conducted on the anaero-bic treatment of distillery wastewaters. Nine years of experience in designing and operating full-scale anaerobic–aerobic treatment plants with fermenta-tion from sugar beet molasses, together with operating problems and their solutions, has been described (Ciftci and Ozturk, 1995). A two-stage treat-ment has been used for high-strength wastewaters since 1986: an anaerobic ﬁ rst stage and an aerobic second stage. The anaerobic reactors used are 
upﬂ ow-anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors with internal and external 
sludge recirculation facilities.
The major process conﬁ  gurations for high-rate digesters over the past 20 
years have been described (Hickey et al., 1991); these include UASB, upﬂ  ow 
and downﬂ  ow stationary packed-bed and ﬂ  uidized- and expanded-bed reac-
tors. An anaerobic upﬂ  ow blanket ﬁ  lter has been used in biomethanation 
(Hanqing and Guowei, 1996) and an unheated anaerobic ﬁ  lter has been used 
in mesophilic digestion (Leal et al., 1998) of brewery wastewaters. Recently, a novel inverse turbulent-bed bioreactor for anaerobic treatment has been discussed (Bufﬁ  ere et al., 2000). Akunna and Clark (2000) described the performance of a granular-bed anaerobic bafﬂ  ed reactor (GRABBR) treat-
ing whisky distillery wastewater. Anaerobic ﬂ  uid-bed technology has been 
found more effective than anaerobic ﬁ  lter technology for treating distillery 
wastewater (Perez et al., 1998). Harada et al. (1996) examined the feasibility of thermophilic (55°C) anaerobic treatment of distillery wastewater (sugar-cane molasses vinasse) using a 140-L UASB reactor for a period of 430 days. COD and BOD removal during the entire experimental period was 39 to 67% and more than 80%, respectively. Wilkie et al. (2000) described the treatment parameters and efﬁ  ciencies of mesophilic and thermophilic anaero-
bic digestion of stillage from beet and cane molasses and other raw materials and listed some of the full-scale anaerobic digesters currently used to treat stillage. Of 149 facilities constructed, 87 are in India. These include 78 UASBs, 3 expanded granular sludge-bed (EGSB) reactors, commissioning of 27 bulk volume fermentors (BVFs), 22 downﬂ  ow ﬁ  xed-ﬁ  lm (DFF) digesters, 10 anaer-
obic contact (AC) digesters, 6 hybrid digesters, and 3 upﬂ  ow ﬁ  xed-ﬁ  lm (UFF) 
digesters. Singh and Nigam (1995) summarized the effectiveness and limita-tions of various alternative treatment technologies of distillery efﬂ  uents in 
India. Brewery wastewater can be treated anaerobically by the addition of activated sludge in reactors. The potential of EGSB reactors has been explored for anaerobic treatment of low-strength brewery wastewater (Kato et al., 1999).
Physical or mechanical separation was one of the earliest methods used to 
recover or remove supended solids containing yeast and other materials. After mechanical separation, a number of technologies exist for further pro-cessing, such as evaporation, single-cell protein production, and anaerobic digestion. Kim et al. (1999) employed membrane separation for the concen-tration of stillage. However, a membrane anaerobic reactor treating brewery wastewater results in inert COD production (Ince et al., 2000). In recent years, thermal and electrochemical methods have been examined that show a potential for stillage processing. Catalytic wet air oxidation is used to treat high-strength distillery liquors (Belkacemi et al., 2000). Goto et al. (1999) showed a rapid reduction in organic strength by supercritical water oxidation of distillery wastewater, using H
2O2 at higher temperatures of 673 to 773 K. 
Electrochemical treatment of distillery spent wash and vinasse from beet molasses produces chlorine, chlorates, and other oxidants that can destruc-tively oxidize COD (Vlyssides et al., 1997; Vijayaraghavan et al., 1999). Beltran et al. (1999a,b) discussed the degradation of distillery wastewater by oxidative treatment using ozone and an integrated ozone–biological treat-ment. Vinasse-containing wastewater can be puriﬁ  ed by an anion-exchange 
process using the biopolymer chitosan (Lalov et al., 2000). These methods are not being used at full scale at present and cannot be considered as proven or economical. Scheper et al. (1999) described the principles of bioanalytical systems for online bioprocess monitoring, including the use of bioanalytical tools for process optimization.ALTERNATIVE INDUSTRIAL STILLAGE TREATMENT REACTORS 7980 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
3.4 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND 
BREWERY WASTES
Decolorization of MSW by physical or chemical methods is unsuitable. Also, 
the mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestions are not free of dis-advantages. Despite rapid growth and assimilation of a wider range of sub-strates by bacteria than fungi, bacterial separation is difﬁ  cult and expensive, 
due to their small size, and their nutritive value has not been fully realized. Bacterial use is limited, due to problems in separation, low ethanol tolerance, lower cell yield, and lower feed by-product return, despite higher ethanol yields. Such factors have limited the market for bacterial feed additives. Algae require high intensities of light and large areas.
Degradation of these wastes requires the selection of microorganisms that 
can assimilate them. Research on the fungal treatment of these wastewaters dates back to the 1960s. Yeasts and fungi have been used for reducing the strength of distillery and brewery wastewaters and molasses with concomitant production of single-cell protein (SCP). Thus, yeasts and fungi are considered the most suitable organisms for these purposes.
Various strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  are most widely used 
because of their good growth rate and high ethanol tolerance (Ingledew, 1995). S. cerevisiae  has been shown to tolerate ethanol concentrations of up 
to 23% when grown under proper nutrient conditions. Some researchers have advocated the use of thermotolerant yeasts to obtain higher fermentation rates and ethanol yields and reduced requirements for cooling. However, Lynd et al. (1991) reported a low ethanol tolerance of thermophilic ferment-ing organisms, due to leaky cell membranes at higher temperatures. Higher temperatures can cause higher saturated esteriﬁ  e d  f a tty  a ci ds,  s u c h  as  p al -
mitic and pamitoleic acids, in the yeast cell membrane at the expense of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids (van Uden, 1984; Suutari et al., 1990). Decrease in the amount of membrane phospho-lipids to maintain membrane ﬂ  uidity for cellular activities in S. cerevisiae  is 
an adaptive response (Lloyd et al., 1993; Rose, 1993). Certain aspects of still-age utilization, bioconversion, and treatment by fungi have been discussed (Friedrich et al., 1992; Wilkie et al., 2000).
3.5 FUNGAL FERMENTATION AND DECOLORIZATION
Operation of the fermentation process has been classiﬁ  ed into three catego-
ries: batch, continuous, and partially continuous. In a batch process, cooled mash is inoculated with yeast equivalent to 10% of the fermentor volume and allowed to ferment about, or less than, 48 hours (ASTM, 1997). Completion of the fermentation results in the formation of stillage. Continuous fermenta-tion has many advantages over batch culture. Higher ethanol production with a decreased yield of yeast can be obtained in continuous fermentation using recycled yeast (Warren et al., 1994) or immobilized yeast (Arasaratnam and 
Balasubramaniam, 1998). Continuous fermentation lowers the stillage COD when yeast is not recovered. In such instances, yeast production is lower than that of batch fermentation. Continuous fermentation is prone to contamina-tion by microorganisms, which secrete their products and increase the stillage COD. In a partially continuous fermentation, yeast is partially recovered before distillation and returned to fermentation. A decrease in volume of stillage and increase in COD are produced by the volume of yeast returned. Stillage recycling is known to lower stillage volume without affecting total COD. Several researchers have reported a practical limit of 50% stillage recycling (de Menezes, 1989; Shojaosadati et al., 1996; ASTM, 1997). Above this limit, yeast inhibition results in lowering ethanol yield and increasing COD concentration. Fungal fermentation and decolorization of distillery and brewery wastes are noted in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.
3.5.1 Yeasts
Yeasts have been cultivated in distillery stillages for a long time. Yeasts can 
grow rapidly and avoid possible contamination in fermentations by other microorganisms. The use of yeast is important, due to high protein and vitamin contents. Studies in 1960s involved the use of many species of Candida
in the conversion of sugarcane and beet molasses distillery efﬂ  uents. Of 203 
yeast strains, Akaki et al. (1981) selected Hansenula ,Debaryomyces , and 
Rhodotorula  for the treatment of sugarcane molasses stillage. An enrichment 
p r o g r a m  r e s u l t e d  i n  f e r m e n t a t i o n  o f  s u g a r c a n e  m o l a s s e s  a t  4 3 ° C  i n  b a t c h  experiments, with the sugar conversion efﬁ  ciency exceeding 94% (Abdel-
Fattah et al., 2000). The two best performers, Saccharomyces cerevisiae  F111 
and Kluyveromyces marxianus  WR12, produced mean ethanol of 7.7% and 
7.4% (w/v), respectively, coupled with the advantage of cooling elimination during fermentation. Batch fermentation showed a diauxic form of cell growth a f t e r  1 8  h o u r s  t h a t  c o u l d  b e  a t t r i b u t e d  t o  a  c h a n g e  i n  t h e  e n z y m e  s y s t e m  related to degradation and absorption of macromolecular components of the sugar beet stillage (Shojaosadati et al., 1999). In a continuous culture, COD was reduced 31% without the addition of nutrients in sugar beet stillage. COD reduction and substrate utilization in three different beet stillages occurred during growth by a thermotolerant yeast, Candida rugosa  (Lee, 1991). Of 
three yeast isolates, MEA5 removed 95% and 46% of the COD of synthetic winery wastewater within 24 hours un der aerated and nonaerated conditions, 
respectively (Malandra et al., 2003). Three yeast isolates reduced the COD 60% after 120 hours. Mixed bioﬁ  lms of yeasts and bacteria in rotating bio-
logical contactor (RBC) reduced the COD 43% in 1 hour.
Of 205 yeast strains, Citeromyces sp. WR-43-6 decolorized 68.91% of the 
molasses pigment solution at 30°C and pH 6.0 containing 2% glucose, 0.1% sodium nitrite, and KH
2PO 4 (Sirianuntapiboon et al., 2004). This strain also 
decolorized 75% of the alcohol factory stillage and reduced the COD 100% FUNGAL FERMENTATION AND DECOLORIZATION 81TABLE 3.1 Fungal Fermentation of Distillery and Brewery Wastes

and the BOD 76%. During a periodic feeding system, Citeromyces sp. WR-
43-6 reduced the color intensity 60 to 70%, the COD 99% and the BOD 91% over an 8-day cultivation period on 10% fresh medium. The strain showed a constant decolorization of 75% during a four-step replacement culture system.
3.5.2 Filamentous Fungi
Filamentous fungi grow slowly and are susceptible to contamination. However, 
ﬁ lamentous fungi exhibit certain advantages, as they produce several extra-
cellular hydrolytic enzymes for the assimilation of complex carbohydrates without prior hydrolysis. This quality makes possible the utilization of complex substrates. Another advantage is the easy separation of biomass by ﬁ  ltration 
due to the ﬁ  lamentous structure. In comparison to yeasts, ﬁ  lamentous fungi 
are less prone to variations in nutrients, aeration, temperature, and pH and have a lower nucleic content in the biomass.
Vinasse contains organic matter that includes more than 10 phenol com-
pounds and their polymers. These compounds are difﬁ  cult to biodegrade and 
hamper removal by anaerobic digestion. It appears that prior removal of these compounds can expedite anaerobic digestion, thereby reducing cost through a shortened water retention time. Anaerobic treatment can be improved by prior removal of phenolic compounds due to aerobic biological treatment (Maestro-Duran et al., 1993). The pretreatment reduced COD, lowered toxic-ity, and diminished phenol content, which makes it amenable to anaerobic treatment.
Aspergillus terreus  removed about 66% of total phenols and 94% of ortho -
diphenols after 100 to 120 hours of fermentation (Garcia et al., 1997). Pre-liminary experiments implied that the end of fermentation was caused by depletion of nitrogen in the medium. Geotrichum candidum  removed about 
70% of total phenols and 91% of ortho -diphenols. These results suggest the 
aerobic degradation of phenol compounds in vinasse without the addition of nutrients in the medium. Biomass content depends on the removal of phenols. The peroxidase activity of G. candidum  Dec 1 was lower, due to the inhibitory 
effect of molasses, but the inhibition decreased after the attainment of full fungus growth (Kim and Shoda, 1999).
Of four fungi, Coriolus versicolor  revealed the highest color removal, with 
a reduction of 0.43 unit at A
475 (equivalent to 53% color reduction) after 10 
days in the presence of 12.5% (v/v) MSW (FitzGibbon et al., 1998). Giant colony and shaking culture methods were employed for the primary and sec-ondary screening of the fungi to decolorize the melanoidins (FitzGibbon et al., 1995). The primary screening indicated a color change from black to light brown in 10 days by C. versicolor  and Mycelia sterilia . Secondary screen-
ing showed the ability of all fungi to reduce COD (55 to 70%) of spent wash.
A bioconversion process for the treatment of fruit distillery wastes using 
ﬁ lamentous fungi has been discussed (Perdih et al., 1991). Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and Trichoderma reesei  produced ﬁ  lter cakes of 22 and 17% 
raw protein contents by degrading raw ﬁ  bers by 20% (Friedrich et al., 1986). 
Species of Aspergillus  revealed better ﬁ  ltration time and COD reduction and 
showed the same efﬁ  ciency in protein synthesis to P. chrysosporium  and T. 
reesei , but did not degrade ﬁ  bers. Due to slow growth, Pleurotus ostreatus  did 
not compete with other fungi. Of 228 strains, nine revealed decolorization exceeding 50% and required different culture conditions (Sirianuntapiboon et al., 1988a). The strain D90 showed the highest decolorization yield, 93%, in 8 days in molasses wastewater containing 2.5% glucose, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.1% KH
2PO 4, and 0.05% MgSO 4 · 7H 2O. M. sterilia  D90 showed the highest 
decolorization, 90%, and a BOD of 80% in 10 days in the presence of nutri-e n t s  s u c h  a s  2 . 5 %  g l u c o s e ,  0 . 2 %  N a N O
3, 0.1% KH 2PO 4, and 0.05% 
MgSO 4 · 7H 2O (Sirianuntapiboon et al., 1988b). The strain decolorized 70% 
in 11 days and eliminated 90% of BOD in 15 days under nonsterile conditions. About 75% molasses melanoidin solution decolorized on glycerol-peptone medium at 45°C in 3 days with shaking using a thermophilic strain, Aspergil-
lus fumigatus  G - 2 - 6  ( O h m o m o  e t  a l . ,  1 9 8 7 ) .  C o n t i n u o u s  d e c o l o r i z a t i o n  
experiments in a jar-fermentor resulted in a constant decolorization of 70% at a dilution rate of 0.014 per hour coupled with elimination of about 50% COD and 56% TOC. Five ﬁ  lamentous fungi reduced up to 60% COD of rum 
stillage; Gliocladium deliquescens  perf ormed best (Bark er et al., 1982). Of 
various ﬁ  lamentous fungi, Aspergillus niger  and A. oryzae  exhibited high 
COD reduction and the highest biomass (de Lamo and de Menezes, 1978).
3.5.3 White-Rot Fungi
White-rot fungi are the most signiﬁ  cant lignin degraders in nature. In the 
1990s, several researchers used white-rot fungi in the decolorization of dis-tillery efﬂ  uents. Decolorization appeared to be attributed to the secretion of 
extracellular ligninolytic enzymes. A marine basidiomycete and the white-rot fungus Flavodon ﬂ  avus  showed good salt tolerance and reduceed color from 
the raw MSW about 70 to 80% at a 10% concentration on LN, ME broth, and sugarcane bagasse media on day 8 (Raghukumar and Rivonkar, 2001). Decolorization activity was also detected in media prepared with half-strength seawater of up to 15 ppt salinity. A two- or threefold reduction in mycelial dry weight and the production of lignin-degrading enzymes such as manga-nese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase was detected in the presence of raw MSW. A negative correlation exists between MnP production and MSW decoloriza-tion. Extracellular enzymes were responsible for the decolorization of synthetic and natural melanoidins in spent wash using Phanerochaete chryso-
sporium  J A G - 4 0  ( D a h i y a  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 1 ) .  G e l - ﬁ  ltration chromatography has 
depicted more rapid decolorization of large-molecular-weight fractions of melanoidins than of small-molecular-weight fractions. Watanabe et al. (1982) reported 80% melanoidin decolorization by a strain of Coriolus . About 49% 
of the color was eliminated in the absence of either glucose or peptone by P. FUNGAL FERMENTATION AND DECOLORIZATION 8586 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
chrysosporium  (Fahy et al., 1997). This seems to be the ﬁ  rst report that shows 
decolorization of MSW in the absence of an additional carbon source. Under optimum conditions, Coriolus versicolor  Ps4a shows the highest decoloriza-
tion yield, 80% (Aoshima et al., 1985). A good correlation exists between decolorization activity and mycelial growth. The decolorization activity is due to decomposition of the molasses pigment and intracellular enzymes.
Molasses pigments are also decolorized by ligninolytic cultures of P. chrys-
osporium  (Durrant, 1996). Production of lignin peroxidase (LiP) increases 
with the addition of molasses to the culture medium. Simultaneous color removal occurs with the appearance of LiP, and the rate of color removal is directly proportional to the activity of LiP . Repeated production of LiP and decolorization of pigment result by immobilizing the fungus in polyurethane foam, providing the possibility of improving the process. Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  also produceed LiP in a culture medium containing molasses 
(Jafelice et al., 1990).
Trametes  sp. I-62 (CECT 20197) treatment removed 73% of the color and 
62% of the COD after 7 days in the presence of 20% (v/v) of distillery vinasses in the medium (Gonzalez et al., 2000). Such conditions resulted in a 35-fold increase in laccase production by Trametes  sp. I-62. A number of 
pyrolysis products, such as furan derivatives, were reduced after 7 days of fungal treatment. Vinasse color removal appeared to be associated with mela-noidin degradation.
3.5.4 Mixed Cultures
Several fungi have been used in pure and mixed cultures for the conversion 
of stillage. This can improve the assimilation of nutrients in stillage and provide better yields of biomass. Combinations of different yeasts, molds, and ﬁ lamentous fungi; yeasts and molds; yeasts and ﬁ  lamentous fungi; and yeasts 
and bacteria are used. Mixed cultures related to the bioconversion of various stillages have been noted (Friedrich et al., 1992). Several yeasts, molds, and bacteria have been employed for the aerobic treatment of sugarcane stillage (Nudel et al., 1987). Using cultures of two yeasts and a mold, Candida utilis
showed a rapid increase in biomass during early stages of growth and estab-lished itself until the end of the process. Mixed cultures of C. utilis  with 
Corynebacterium acetoacidophilum  and of C. utilis  with Brevibacterium 
ﬂ avum  are known to increase the amino acid and vitamin contents of the 
biomass. C. utilis  with Azotobacter  is a good combination. Azotobacter  can 
prevent nitrogen addition in stillage, and the increased biomass is related to nitrogen ﬁ  xation by bacteria.
A two-step continuous fermentation has also been used for the conversion 
of stillage. C. utilis  produced high quantities of biomass during the ﬁ  rst step, 
and Aspergillus niger  reduced the COD of the efﬂ  uent during the second step 
(Nudel et al., 1987). Of ﬁ  ve ﬁ lamentous fungi, Trichoderma viride  and Pae-
cilomyces variotii  proved to be the most effective organisms. A two-step continuous aerobic process was suggested for the treatment of cane stillage 
(Castlla et al., 1984). During the ﬁ  rst step, the original stillage was employed 
for the cultivation of C. utilis , and the decanted supernatant was used during 
the second step, where a strain of Paecilomyces  was cultivated without the 
addition of nutrients. A total COD reduction of 87% and a mixed biomass output of 2.3 to 2.6 g/l per hour, mostly Candida , were achieved. A two-stage 
process for beet molasses, with Hansenula anomala  J 45-N-5 followed by an 
unknown soil yeast isolate I-44, resulted in a 75% reduction in COD (Cabib et al., 1983).
Malnou et al. (1987) showed a 54.9% reduction in the COD of whiskey 
stillage using a mixed culture of Geotrichum candidum ,Candida krusei , and 
H. anomala . A mixed culture of a ﬁ  lamentous fungus and two yeasts was 
employed for protein production in whiskey distillery spent wash (Barker et al., 1982). Contamination was also prevented by the use of mixed cultures in continuous fermentation. Candida krusei  was the dominant organism during 
the early stage and at high dilution rates and used protein as both carbon and nitrogen sources. G. candidum  and H. anomala  assimilated carbohydrates, 
glycerol, and lactate.
3.6 MOLASSES TOXICITY TO FUNGI
Increased tolerance of toxic substances from beet molasses results in changes 
in the development and ultrastructure of Aspergillus niger  mycelium, strain 
Z (Zakowska and Gabara, 1991). Toxic molasses compounds and Spumol BJ at a concentration of 5 μl per 100 cm
3 produced conidia swelling. Giant conidia 
were unable to germinate and the mycelium began sinking after 24 hours. Electron microscopic examination revealed the electron-transparent cyto-plasm with a decrease in ribosome number and changes in the ultrastructure of mitochondria. This may be attributed to a disturbance of respiratory pro-cesses in the mycelium. The appearance of electron-dense deposits in mito-chondria implies the onset of a defense mechanism, eliminating toxic substances. Cell walls of mycelium of A. niger  strains sensitive or resistant to 
toxic molasses growing in the presence of Spumol K have also been examined (Gabara and Zakowska, 1997).
3.7 FACTORS AFFECTING FUNGAL FERMENTATION 
AND DECOLORIZATION
Several factors, such as sources of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus; pH; 
temperature; dilution of the efﬂ  uent; inoculum dose; and static versus agitated 
culture conditions, are known to inﬂ  uence the rate of decolorization and 
COD removal of distillery and brewery efﬂ  uents by fungi (Table 3.3). These 
factors are described below.FACTORS AFFECTING FUNGAL FERMENTATION AND DECOLORIZATION 87TABLE 3.3 Inﬂ  uence of Supplements on Fungal Fermentation and Decolorization of Distillery and Brewery Wastes

883.7.1 Carbon Source
The availability of a carbon source is a requirement for the growth of fungi 
and melanoidin removal. The spent wash contains little readily available carbon despite high total sugar content. Of various carbon sources, glucose provides the highest growth and decolorization rates. Of several carbon sources (e.g., pentoses, hexoses, and sugar alcohols), glucose or sucrose proves best for decolorization of raw MSW at 10% concentration in LN medium using Flavodon ﬂ  avus  (Raghukumar and Rivonkar, 2001). Optimum growth 
and decolorization of digested MSW occur at up to 3% glucose (w/v) for Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and up to 5% (w/v) for Coriolus versicolor
( K u m a r  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 8 ) .  T h e  d e c o l o r i z a t i o n  a c t i v i t y  c o r r e l a t e s  w e l l  w i t h  t h e  growth of mycelia of A. niger  (Miranda et al., 1996).
3.7.2 Nitrogen and Phosphorus Sources
Nitrogen is a component of cell wall polymers and is important for protein 
synthesis. A low-nitrogen medium favors the highest decolorization of MSW by F. ﬂ avus  (Raghukumar and Rivonkar, 2001). Shojaosadati et al. (1999) 
reported a COD reduction of 35.7% by the supplementation of 4 g/dm
3 ammo-
nium sulfate and 0.4 g/dm3 KH 2PO 4 to sugar beet stillage in a continuous 
culture of Hansenula sp. The highest productivity is achieved in a dilution 
rate of 0.12 per hour. No doubt, supplementation of these nutrients increases the levels in COD reduction and biomass production, but its use depends on the overall economic evaluation of the process. Among the various nitrogen sources, yeast extract and peptone were shown to support the highest growth and decolorization by Coriolus versicolor  and Phanerochaete chrysosporium ,
respectively (Kumar et al., 1998). Of various additives, phosphoric acid was shown to provide the best protein and biomass production in Candida krusei
(Ruegger and Tauk-Tornisielo, 1996). Candida rugosa  reached a maximum 
of T
X/COD  (biomass production/COD reduction) and YCPP/COD  (crude protein 
production/COD reduction) at a concentration of 2 g/l of urea in a shaking culture at 4°C for 2 days (Lee and Lee, 1995). At this concentration, the yeast showed the highest biosynthetic rate and the lowest energy maintenance. The highest decolorizing activity of strain D90 occurs in the presence of yeast extract, peptone, and sodium nitrate as the nitrogen sources (Sirianuntapiboon et al., 1988a).
The highest color removal occurred in the absence of the addition of 
ammonium nitrate by Trametes versicolor  (Benito et al., 1997). The COD 
removal rate was 65 to 70%. The color elimination and COD reduction were similar and more or less unaffected by the various manganese and magnesium concentrations. About 80% of the COD was removed in the presence of 1 g/l of KH
2PO 4 compared to 53% in the absence of phosphate in the wastewater. 
An addition of 1 g/l of potassium phosphate caused 68% color elimination and 72% COD removal using Aspergillus niger  (Miranda et al., 1996). About FACTORS AFFECTING FUNGAL FERMENTATION AND DECOLORIZATION 8990 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
68% of the color was eliminated by the addition of 0.5 g/l MgSO 4 · 7H 2O to 
the wastewater. The COD removal was 65 to 70%, which remained almost unaffected by magnesium concentration. Color removal was enhanced from 34% to 68.5% by the addition of 1.8 g/l of ammonium nitrate.
3.7.3 Temperature
Temperature inﬂ  uences growth, metabolism, nutrition, enzymes, biomass, 
and cell permeability. Temperature control generally adds a cost to an indus-trial operation. Thus, it is important to determine the temperature range where fungi can show the maximum growth rate or product formation. Based on the continuous culture of Hansenula  sp. at various temperatures, the 
temperature range 32 to 36°C was shown to be optimum for activities (Shojaosadati et al., 1999). This temperature also provided better ﬂ  occulation 
characteristics, which would improve the recovery cost. However, a sharp decline in growth was found beyond these deviating temperatures. The optimum growth and highest color removal occurred at 30°C for the strain D90 (Sirianuntapiboon et al., 1988a), 35°C for Coriolus versicolor , and 40°C 
for Phanerochaete chrysosporium  (Kumar et al., 1998). These temperatures 
are also optimum for the enzymes responsible for decolorization. Candida 
rugosa  grows faster with a COD reduction rate of 45.5% and a biomass yield 
of 14.7 g/l at 40°C (Lee and Baerwald, 1991).
3.7.4 pH
The pH plays an important role in the decolorization process because some 
of the components of wastewater color are soluble over a certain range of basic pH and insoluble at acidic pH. C. versicolor and P. chrysosporium
promote the highest color removal, 52% and 33.5% at pH 5.0, respectively (Kumar et al., 1998). The best decolorization (80%) and highest COD removal (75%) were shown to occur at an initial pH of 5 (Benito et al., 1997). The initial pH does not affect the percentage removal of NH
4+—N. The reduction 
in the ammonium concentration ranged from 25 to 35%. Total color elimina-tion was 69% at an initial pH of 5.0 (Miranda et al., 1996). All isolates, including strain D90, exhibited a high level of decolorizing activity at pH 5 to 6 (Sirianuntapiboon et al., 1988a).
3.7.5 Agitation and Aeration
The availability of oxygen is one of the most important factors for the indus-
trial production of yeasts. Agitation and aeration are two factors that can affect the oxygen transfer rate in cultures. Agitation affects oxygen and sub-strate uptake, consumption of energy, production of biomass, and overall production costs. Agitation affects gas–liquid mass transfer in three ways: (1) increasing the contact area by dispersion of small bubbles, (2) increasing the gas–liquid contact time through the whirling movement, and (3) reducing the 
consistency of liquid ﬁ  lm through turbulence.
Biomass production and COD reduction by Hansenula  sp. were shown to 
increase with an increase in agitation speed, and the maximum performance reached at 900 rpm (Shojaosadati et al., 1999). A higher agitation speed can cause disruption of fungal cell walls, thereby decreasing performance. Aerobic batch fermentation is conducted at a constant speed of 500 rpm for Aspergil-
lus terreus  and Geotrichum candidum  (Garcia et al., 1997). Another impor-
tant factor is aeration that affects the oxygen transfer rate by increasing the partial oxygen pressure. The optimum aeration rate for the production of maximum Hansenula  sp. biomass and COD reduction was shown to be 1.5 
(v/v/m) (Shojaosadati et al., 1999). The best decolorization of MSW has been demonstrated by Flavodon ﬂ  avus in oxygenated cultures (Raghukumar and 
Rivonkar, 2001). A shaking rate of more than 100 oscillations/min was sufﬁ  -
cient for a decolorization yield of 60 to 65%, which is equivalent to 1 ppm of dissolved oxygen (Ohmomo et al., 1985).
3.7.6 Inoculum Size
Few researchers have focused on the effect of inoculum size on the decolor-
ization and COD reduction of MSW. Dahiya et al. (2001) demonstrated a 5% (w/v) dry weight of mycelial supension of Phanerochaete chrysosporium
JAG-40 to be optimal for maximum decolorization in melanoidin medium supplemented with glucose and peptone. Color elimination and COD reduc-tion occurred with different inoculum mycelial concentrations in batch cul-tures of Trametes versicolor (Benito et al., 1997). Similar yields of color 
elimination (80%) were obtained at mycelia concentrations of 1.5 to 2 g/l. Higher mycelia concentrations started biodegrading after 2 days of culture, with lower mycelia concentrations the third day. The COD removal ranged from 72 to 75% and remained unaffected by the initial mycelia concentra-tions. A constant decolorization yield of 75% occurred after 6 days of culture of strain D90 at the rate of inoculum size of 0.15 g of mycelia per 100 ml of medium (Sirianuntapiboon et al., 1988a). The optimum mycelia mass of Coriolus versicolor  Ps4a for decolorization was 1.2 g dry weight (Ohmomo 
et al., 1985).
3.7.7 Efﬂ  uent Dilution Rate
The dilution rate affects biomass yield and productivity. Productivity is a 
function of cell concentration in a fermentor and the speciﬁ  c growth rate. The 
effect of efﬂ  uent dilution rate on decolorization and COD removal by fungi 
was summarized in the foregoing paragraphs. The treatment of distillery wastewater at various dilutions by yeasts has been described by Moriya et al. (1990).FACTORS AFFECTING FUNGAL FERMENTATION AND DECOLORIZATION 9192 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
3.8 MECHANISMS OF MELANOIDIN DEGRADATION
Molasses is difﬁ  cult to decompose by the usual biological treatment pro-
cesses, due to the presence of melanoidins. Melanoidin is a complex polymer formed by Maillard aminocarbonyl reaction products, and its chemical struc-ture remains unknown. Despite wide distribution in food and preservation processes, melanoidins are not easily degraded by microorganisms, including fungi. The role of enzymes other than laccase or peroxidases in melanoidin decolorization by strains of Coriolus  (Trametes ) was documented during the 
1980s. Aoshima et al. (1985) claimed the induction of intracellular enzymes by Coriolus versicolor  Ps4a in the presence of melanoidin. Two-thirds of 
enzymes may be sugar dependent and the other one-third independent of sugar. The sugar-dependent enzymes seem to be the same as sorbose oxidase from Coriolus  sp. no. 20 or a similar kind of sugar oxidase (Watanabe et al., 
1 9 8 2 ).  T h e  d e c o l o r i z a t i o n  o f  m e l a n o i d i n s  m a y  b e  c a u s e d  b y  a c t i v e  o x y g e n  produced by reaction with these sugar oxidases.
Little is known about the role of fungal ligninolytic enzymes in decoloriza-
tion of distillery efﬂ  uents. A culture ﬁ  ltrate of T. versicolor  showed a mineral-
izing activity on melanoidins (Dehorter and Blondeau, 1993). A 47-kDa extracellular protein carried out the mineralization of melanoidins, and this Mn(II)-dependent system required oxygen and was inhibited by the inhibi-tors of heme proteins. However, oxidation did not occur through the forma-tion of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of melanoidins as substrate. Cell-free extracts from T. versicolor  also showed Mn(II)-dependent enzyme activity 
on melanoidins. Trametes  sp. I-62 produced laccase activity as a result of a 
response to the oxidizing of compounds in distillery vinasse, and this dimin-ished their potential toxic effects (Mansur et al., 1997). Gonzalez et al. (2000) reported a laccase activity of 0.02 U/ml by Trametes  sp. I-62 in Kirk’s medium 
and 0.7 U/ml in Kirk’s medium supplemented with 20% vinasses. This 35-fold increase in laccase activity may imply an enhancement of laccase production by some components of vinasses. However, laccase activity was enhanced twofold by Trametes  sp. I-62 containing 20% efﬂ  uent (Mansur et al., 1997). 
A higher increase in laccase activity may be related to decolorization of the efﬂ u e n t  ( G o n z a l e z  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 0 ) .  M i y a t a  e t  a l .  ( 1 9 9 8 )  r e p o r t e d  e n z y m a t i c  
decolorization of melanoidins by Coriolus hirsutus  pellets. This is one of the 
more complete enzymatic studies on the decolorization of melanoidins. Synthetic melanoidins are decolorized by the participation of manganese peroxidase (MnP) and manganese-independent peroxidase (MIP) and the extracellular H
2O2 produced by glucose oxidase along with the partial par-
ticipation of laccase.
Decolorization of sugar reﬁ  nery efﬂ  uent by Phanerochaete chrysosporium
coincided with the time of detection of MnP in the medium (Guimaraes et al., 1996). P. chrysosporium  J A G - 4 0  p r o d u c e s  e x t r a c e l l u l a r  e n z y m e s ,  
which resulted in a 40 to 50% color removal of synthetic melanoidins in 24 hours (Dahiya et al., 2001). The culture ﬁ  ltrate was used as the enzyme source 
for melanoidin decolorization. Kumar et al. (1998) reported on decolorization as a result of secondary metabolic reaction from a secondary metabolite by white-rot fungi. But the nature of the secondary metabolite is unknown. Increased glucose oxidase activity correlates with the increasing decoloriza-tion of MSW by free mycelia of Flavodon ﬂ  avus  (Raghukumar et al., 2004). 
It has been proposed that glucose oxidase activity leads to the formation of hydrogen peroxide, which acts as a bleaching agent on the MSW. Further studies on the contribution of MnP, LiP, MIP, or intracellular H
2O2-producing 
enzymatic systems for the degradation of melanoidins are required. In addi-tion, the role of other enzymes and some mediators or inducers for color removal need to be investigated.
Color adsorption is also one of the mechanisms of melanoidin decoloriza-
tion. The color adsorption onto mycelia of T. versicolor (Benito et al., 1997) 
and Aspergillus niger (Miranda et al., 1996) occurs throughout the experi-
ments. The percentages of color adsorbed on T. versicolor  and Aspergillus 
niger  mycelia are 5 to 10 and 10 to 25%, respectively. About 83% decoloriza-
tion and 17% adsorption on the mycelium of A. niger  occur in optimum 
nutrient culture concentrations. Benito et al. (1997) revealed 90% decoloriza-tion and 10% adsorption on the mycelium of Trametes versicolor  in optimum 
nutrient culture concentrations. High decolorization activity occurred by adsorption of melanoidins to the mycelium of a strain of Aspergillus fumiga-
tus G-2-6 (Ohmomo et al., 1987).
3.9 FUNGAL BIOREACTORS FOR DISTILLERY AND 
BREWERY WASTES
Fungal conversion of distillery stillage usually employs submerged processes, 
which are conducted in shaken ﬂ  asks and fermentors. Stirred-tank bioreac-
tors have been in use for the last two decades. Column fermentors have also been employed by several researchers. The volume of laboratory fermentors ranges from several hundred milliliters to several liters. Batch and continuous modes of operation are well established. A two-stage continuous cultivation with one fungus or two different fungi or microorganisms is also recognized. In certain cases, sterile conditions are necessary, and in others, such condi-tions are not required. Antifoam agents or mechanical devices are used to disrupt foam during fermentation. Different rates of aeration are used in different types of bioreactors. The dilution rates are generally tested in con-tinuous cultivation and two-stage continuous processes. After fermentation, the yeast biomass can be separated from the broth by centrifugation and in ﬁ lamentous fungi by ﬁ  ltration and screening. Table 3.4 lists the important 
bioreactor types used for the decolorization of distillery and brewery wastes.FUNGAL BIOREACTORS FOR DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES 93TABLE 3.4 Fungal Bioreactors for Decolorization of Distillery and Brewery Wastes

943.9.1 Fed-Batch Bioreactors
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  grows on sugarcane molasses in batch and fed-
batch cultivation (Win et al., 1996). The temperature, pH, agitator speed, and airﬂ ow rate used in the batch reactor were 30°C, 5.5, 500 rpm and 2.5 l/min, 
respectively. The productivity and overall cell yield on molasses were 0.22 g/l per hour and 0.18 g of cells per gram of sugar, respectively. In a fed-batch stirred-tank reactor, a productivity of 2.33 g/l per hour and an overall cell yield of 0.46 g of cells per gram of sugars were obtained. However, the ethanol concentration was 0.45 g/l and the biomass yield was 44.2 g/l at the end of growth. The fed-batch system was also used for the decolorization of molasses wastewater by Mycelia sterilia  D90 (Sirianuntapiboon et al., 1988b). The 
fungus revealed a sufﬁ  cient and constant decolorization activity of 80%, 79%, 
and 79% in the ﬁ  rst, second, and third batches, respectively. The BOD value 
was also reduced to 25.8%, 25%, and 34.2% in the ﬁ  rst, second, and third 
batches, respectively. The system reduced the constant value of nitrate in the molasses wastewater.
3.9.2 Bubble Column Bioreactors
The color of molasses wastewater can be reduced continuously in a bubble 
column reactor using Aspergillus niger (Miranda et al., 1996). During this 
process, the maximum color removal was 37% and was maintained constant for 4 days, and the decolorization activity declined thereafter. The maximum oxygen consumption was related to the maximum decolorization activity and the lowest pH value. However, the decolorization activity decreased and the dissolved oxygen increased after 4 days of continuous operation. In a bubble column bioreactor using mycelia of Coriolus versicolor  Ps4a, 75% decoloriza-
tion was shown at a dilution rate of 0.03 h
−1 in 20 hours under optimum condi-
tions (Ohmomo et al., 1985). Immobilized mycelia in calcium–alginate gel exhibited constant decolorization of 65.7% for 16 days at a dilution rate of 0.22 h
−1; 53% of the COD and 46% of the TOC were also removed.
Yeasts are also used in aerated reactors to process efﬂ  uents of high volu-
metric load (Malnou et al., 1987). Despite the high salinity and COD values of sugar beet molasses, yeasts can be employed to process high volumetric loads exceeding 80 kg of COD per cubic meter per day, reducing 70% of the COD.
3.9.3 Fluidized-Bed Bioreactors
An efﬁ  cient process has been developed for the utilization of the Shochu
distillery wastewater using Aspergillus awamori  var. kawachi (Kida et al., 
1995). The jar-fermentor studies were carried out aerobically (1 v/v per minute of aeration) at 35°C in a 30-L fermentor (at a working volume of 18 L) with an agitator (250 rpm agitation) containing distillery wastewater as the medium. FUNGAL BIOREACTORS FOR DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES 9596 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
The crude protein content of the harvested mycelium was about 40% (w/w) 
on a dry basis and could be employed as a protein supplement in livestock feed. An anaerobic ﬂ  uidized-bed bioreactor was used for the treatment of 
cultural ﬁ  ltrate in the process above was diluted three times with tap water. 
A 70% TOC removal efﬁ  ciency was maintained with a loading rate of 22 g/l 
per day. Methane gas evolution increased with an increase in the TOC loading rate and reached a level of 24.9 L per day. The anaerobically treated waste-water was fed to denitriﬁ  cation and nitriﬁ  cation reactors connected in series 
that utilize the acclimatized denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria. Removal efﬁ ciencies of NH
4+ (97%) and TOC (94%) could be maintained for 30 days. 
The effectiveness of the nitriﬁ  ca ti on r eactors sugg ests the sui tabili ty o f the 
discharge of the efﬂ  uent to a river. In addition, this efﬂ  uent may be used as 
a liquid fertilizer because of the presence of nitrate and phosphate.
3.9.4 Immobilized Bioreactors
Cells of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  immobilized in calcium–alginate 
beads resulted in a much more rapid decolorization of MSW than did free cells (Fahy et al., 1997). Maximum color reduction occurred between 0 and 2 days. However, the color elimination was reduced from 85% with free cells to 59% with immobilized cells after 10 days. The immobilized Coriolus ver-
sicolor  on nylon cubes in a packed-bed bioreactor eliminated the COD of the 
pretreated spent wash by a further 50.3%, reaching a total reduction of 77% (FitzGibbon et al., 1995). Only 4% color was eliminated, and this was due primarily to absorption onto the fungal mycelia rather than enzymatic oxida-tion. It is possible to bioremediate such spent waste using a multistage treat-ment process with an initial treatment with Geotrichum candidum . In one 
study it was shown that immobilized Flavodon ﬂ  avus  in 1 cm
2 of polyurethane 
foam could be used effectively for three consecutive cycles of decolorization of fresh 10% MSW (Raghukumar et al., 2004). The fungus also removed about 98% of the toxicity of the MSW using an estuarine ﬁ  sh, Oreochromis 
mossambicus . Benzo[ a]pyrene was present in the MSW and appeared to be 
one of the causes of toxicity. The total PAH concentration in the MSW was reduced by 68% after 5 days. This is a ﬁ  rst report of decolorization of MSW 
along with simultaneous detoxiﬁ  cation and reduction in the PAH content of 
the MSW.
Four fungi— Penicillium  sp., Penicillium decumbens ,Penicillium ligno-
rum, and Aspergillus niger —produced maximum decolorization of beet 
molasses alcoholic fermentation wastewater on the fourth day of treatment in a study by Jimenez et al. (2003). P. decumbens  produced a maximum decol-
orization of 40%. Four fungi reduced an average of 70% of the phenolic content of the wastewater. Penicillium  sp. and P. decumbens  removed 52.1% 
and 50.7% of the COD, respectively, on the ﬁ  fth day of fermentation. Anaero-
bic digestion of previously fermented P. decumbens  beet molasses was carried 
out in suspended cell bioreactors. This treatment removed an average of 93% COD with a methane yield coefﬁ  cient of 305 ml of methane at STP per gram 
of COD removal. This combined aerobic–anaerobic treatment removed 96.5% of the COD and reduced the HRT to eliminate COD.
The VFA/alkalinity ratio has been used as a measure of process stability 
(Balaguer et al., 1992). The VFA/alkalinity ratio was 1.4 and 0.6 for untreated and fermented molasses, respectively, which suggests the removal of volatile fatty acids from the respective wastewater by anaerobic biomasses, with the system reaching equilibrium. Anaerobic digestion of untreated and treated molasses followed the ﬁ  rst-order kinetics for biomass loading rates in the 
range 0 to 0.55 and 0 to 0.75 g of COD per gram of volatile suspended solids (VSS) per day, respectively. Strong brewery waste has been trickled through a vertical curtain of two 3 mm layers of reticulated polyurethane foam bonded to a reinforcing nylon cloth core (Henry and Thomson, 1993). Geotrichum 
fragrans  adhered tenaciously to the curtain and acted as a matrix for other 
yeasts or bacteria. A thick lawn was produced by this process in which a lack of nutrition to cells forced impairment of the curtain. This curtain conﬁ  gura-
tion acts as a self-reproducing cell immobilization on a solid support. Ninety-four percent of the COD was reduced (from 55 000 mg/l to 3300 mg/l) by passing through 6 m of curtain. A 1 m
2 curtain with a 4-m fall can treat 
15 l/d.
3.10 MODELING
A mathematical model has been developed to compare the behavior of fungi 
and prediction of the removal of phenols during aerobic pretreatment (Garcia et al., 1997). The fungi conformed to the Monod equation when grown with COD as the substrate. The maximum speciﬁ  c growth rate and kinetic con-
stant were 0.06 h
−1 and 13 525 mg COD/l for Aspergillus niger  and 0.047 h−1
and 4558 mg COD/l for Geotrichum candidum . The cell yields relative to the 
substrate were 0.38 mg cells/mg COD for Aspergillus terreus  and 0.39 mg 
cells/mg COD for G. candidum . The efﬁ  ciencies to degrade the phenolic 
compounds by A. terreus  and G. candidum  were 0.033 and 0.036 mg total 
phenol/mg cell, respectively. The kinetic model showed slightly better behav-ior for G. candidum .
The growth kinetics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  using sugarcane molasses 
has been studied by the substrate inhibition model (Win et al., 1996). Associ-ated parameters of a fermentation model for fed-batch culture and the optimum level of reducing sugar have been determined using nonlinear regression. A feeding procedure to control reducing sugar at the optimum level has been developed. Data from fed-batch experiments have been used to determine the optimum reducing sugar concentration and optimum spe-ciﬁ c growth rate of S. cerevisiae . The feed rate calculated by an equation was 
corrected by testing the reducing sugar concentration at sampling time and reducing an excess of reducing sugar to the optimum level, resulting in higher MODELING 9798 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
productivity and cell yield. The experimental results showed increased pro-
ductivity and overall cell yield by controlling sugar at an optimum level, which was determined by the fermentation model. Agrawal et al. (1989) used an algorithm for an online estimate of a fed-batch fermentation rate without measuring nutrient concentration.
A mathematical model, kinetics of biodegradation, and determination of 
the macroenergetic parameters for the anaerobic digestion of molasses with aerobic pretreatment by Penicillium decumbens  have been described (Jimenez 
et al., 1997). A favorable effect of the aerobic pretreatment was shown on the kinetics of the anaerobic digestion process of molasses. The experimental data were used in an equation from which the kinetic constant was calculated. The overall kinetic constant value for pretreated molasses was approximately double that for untreated molasses. This is due to the fact that treatment with P. decumbens  removed 67.7% of the phenols present in the molasses. A math-
ematical model using three differential equations was formulated for the aerobic degradation of vinasses with P. decumbens , assuming that a fraction 
of the substrate is partially biodegradable (Jimenez et al., 2005). The model accurately predicted biomass concentrations with time in the process and parameters that affect the aerobic degradation.
The kinetic behavior and ﬂ  occulation characteristics of Candida rugosa  at 
20, 30, and 40°C in a batch fermentation of sugar beet stillage have been studied (Lee and Baerwald, 1991). The batch fermentation kinetics on 8% dry matter of sugarcane stillage was examined during the growth of Candida 
rugosa  at 40°C (Lee and Lee, 1995). The speciﬁ  c growth rate of C. rugosa  is 
0.17 h
−1 and productivity of biomass is 0.91 g/l per hour. These values are 
somewhat lower than those of sugar beet stillages. During assimilation, organic acids and glycerol were consumed rapidly and the COD reduction of sugarcane stillage remained 41%.
3.11 ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE
Fungi produce a double beneﬁ  t during the bioconversion of distillery and 
brewery wastes. Efﬂ  uent is puriﬁ  ed concomitant with the production of fungal 
biomass rich in protein. The bioconversion of different stillage by strains of Candida utilis , various other yeasts, and ﬁ  lamentous fungi is well established 
(Friedrich et al., 1992; Wilkie et al., 2000).
3.11.1 Single-Cell Protein Production
The scarcity of protein-rich food has forced humankind to explore alternative 
sources of protein. Single-cell proteins (SCPs) in different regions of the world have recently been reviewed (Anupama and Ravindra, 2000). Singh (1998) discussed the SCP production of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  on molas-
ses stillage. SCPs on malt whiskey stillage can also be used as an aquaculture feed (Murray and Marchant, 1986). A mixed culture of Candida krusei ,
Geotrichum candidum , and Hansenula anomala  was used to replace up to 
50% of the casein protein in the feed of rainbow trout. Martin et al. (1993) reported a C. utilis  biomass exhibiting a good amino acid composition with 
a protein content of 520 g/kg and a relatively low lipid content. Dry yeast is a suitable source of protein in the diet of cultivated rainbow trout.
Lee and Kim (2001) produced C. utilis  biomass as aquafeeds by three dif-
ferent types of aerobic fermentations on molasses. The biomass yield and productivity were 0.67 and 0.24 for a batch culture, 0.51 and 1.95 for a fed-batch culture with sigmoidal feeding strategy, and 0.36 g/g and 2.15 g/l per hour for continuous cultures, respectively. The fed-batch fermentation was best for mass production of C. utilis  and calculated to be $2.76 per kilogram 
of dry cells. The favorable production cost matched well with the sale price of the commercially yeast product. Highly concentrated Brazilian sugarcane stillage favored a biomass production of 20.4 g/l using the thermotolerant yeast Candida rugosa  (Lee and Lee, 1995). Shojaosadati et al. (1999) obtained 
39.6% crude protein content in Hansenula  sp. in the absence of additives and 
50.6% in the presence of additives such as nitrogen and phosphorus sources. The amount of essential amino acid proﬁ  les of SCP is greater than the Food 
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reference protein and is comparable to that of some other proteins, such as soybean and ﬁ  sh meal.
Aspergillus awamori  var. kawachi  produced a yield of 40 g/l of biomass, 
40% protein content, and 44% reduction of TOC in jar-fermentor culture in Shochu  distillery wastewater (Morimura et al., 1994b). Digestibility of the 
biomass was determined by digestion with pepsin and was about 52% without pretreatment, increasing to 62% after heating at 100°C for 20 minutes. Higher yield and composition of biomass within 24 hours indicate its use as a fodder.
Selenium in the organic bound is accepted as an essential element for the 
growth of animals and humans. Nagodawithana and Gutmanis (1985) revealed organically bound selenium yeast production with 1000 μg of selenium per 
gram of dry biomass using sodium selenite as the selenium source. Production of organically bound selenium was enhanced in a fed-batch fermentation with continuous feeding of sodium selenite using Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Demirci et al., 1999). Two adapted strains, FD10 and FD14, displayed the highest selenium incorporation, 3200 μg per gram of dry biomass.
3.11.2 Ethanol Production
Ethanol is one of the major bioenergy sources that can be produced from 
sugarcane molasses using strains of S. cerevisiae  through batch fermentation 
processes. During the last two decades, several approaches to increased pro-ductivity of ethanol have been used, such as yeast recycling, strain selection, and fed-batch and continuous fermentation. Ethanol production from distill-ery and brewery wastes by fungi is noted in Table 3.5.ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 99TABLE 3.5 Ethanol Production from Distillery and Brewery Wastes

1003.11.3 Bioproducts
In recent years, the use of stillage in the production of various biological 
products, such as enzymes, plant hormones, chitosan, astaxanthin, and the biopolymers alternan and pullulan, has received considerable attention (Table 3.6). In one report, the production of gibberellic acid (GA
3) by Aspergillus 
niger  in media prepared from molasses and vinasse was 310 and 273 mg/l, 
respectively (Cihangir and Aksoz, 1996). Yurekli et al. (1999) demonstrated the production of indole acetic acid, gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, and cyto-kinin by both Funalia trogii  and Trametes versicolor  at a 1 : 4 dilution of still-
age. Chitosan has been produced by Gongronella butleri onShochu  distillery 
wastewater and resulted in a 49% COD reduction (Yokoi et al., 1998). Len-
tinus  (Lentinula ) edodes  p r o d u c e d  h i g h  l e v e l s  o f  m a n g a n e s e  p e r o x i d a s e  
(MnP) and laccase on a malt-containing by-product of the brewing process when mixed with oak wood chips (Hatvani and Mecs, 2001).
Astaxanthin, a highly oxygenated carotenoid produced by Phafﬁ  a rho-
dozyma , has two main uses in aquaculture and orthomolecular medicine 
(Fontana et al., 1997). Low biomass yield and intermediate astaxanthin content have been obtained in 1 : 10 diluted crude sugarcane juice, but these were enhanced by the addition of corn steep liquor. Roukas and Liakopoulou-Kyriakides (1999) investigated the production of pullulan from treated beet molasses by Aureobasidium pullulans  in a stirred-tank fermentor, as well as 
the effect of various fermentation conditions. An aeration rate of 1.0 (v/v) per minute resulted in a pullulan concentration of 23 g/l and a pullulan yield of 40%. The addition of phytate to untreated beet molasses enhanced the pro-duction of citric acid by Aspergillus niger (Jianlong, 1998). Aspergillus terreus
secreted riboﬂ  avin (vitamin B
2) in a medium containing beet molasses as a 
s o l e  s o ur c e  o f  c a r b o n  ( S a b ry  e t  a l . ,  1 99 3 ).  S t e r o l s  w e r e  p r o d u c e d  b y  s o m e  molds in beet molasses–containing medium (Ghanem et al., 1990). For other molds, Penicillium crustosum  exhibited a superior ability for a total sterol 
production of 4% on a dry weight basis. Maximum fermentation yields occurred when beet molasses was treated with H
2SO 4 followed by centrifuga-
tion. Maximum sterol yields of 8.4% were produced in a medium at pH 7 .0 after 8 days of fermentation. Balobova and Kondrashchenko (2000) examined the composition and properties of molasses-containing yeast fermentation waste as a plasticizer and biological additive to concrete mixtures.
Glycerol has an important production history and is used in several pro-
cesses, such as the manufacture of drugs, cosmetics, toothpaste, lubricants, tobacco processing, and food production. Glycerol can be produced from alcoholic fermentation of sugarcane molasses using Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Mostafa, 1995). The maximum glycerol production was obtained on molas-ses (24.35%) after 48 hours. Mostafa and Magdy (1998) examined a continu-ous fermentation process for glycerol production from crude untreated sugarcane molasses in a vertical packed-bed reactor with S. cerevisiae  cells 
immobilized in agar gel. A higher dilution rate of 0.56 h

3.11.4 Algal Production
Good information is available on the pollution deloading of distillery wastes 
by fungi, but little is known of the removal of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus by algae in these efﬂ  uents. Utilization of these efﬂ  uents for the 
preparation of yeast or fungal inoculum has also been recognized. Ferraz et al. (1986) reported on the utilization of dilute molasses stillage along with 74% elimination of COD by Spirulina maxima . However, Spirulina platensis
is known for utilizing nutrients from efﬂ  uents, is easy to harvest, and has a 
potential market as an animal feed supplement. Kadioglu and Algur (1992) found that the growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardii  was stimulated by the 
addition of 5% vinasse, and a reduction in growth with over 10% stillage. Some microalgae have a potential for the removal of heavy metals from distillery efﬂ  ents (Travieso et al., 1999a). Travieso et al. (1999b) reported on 
nutrient removal and potential growth measurement in distillery wastes by Chlorella vulgaris .
3.12 BIOTECHNOLOGY
Screening of a number of strains and optimization of the respective fermenta-
tions are important for the production of high biomass yield. Several studies related to such screening have been reported in the literature during the last two decades. The optimum temperature ranges between 25 and 30°C for most strains of S. cerevisiae . A few reports discuss the growth and ethanol fermen-
tation of S. cerevisiae  at higher temperatures: 40°C (Banat et al., 1998), with 
S. cerevisiae  F111 at 43°C ( Abdel-F attah et al., 2000). Several reports have 
appeared on thermotolerant strains of Kluyveromyces  (Banat et al., 1992; 
Banat and Marchant, 1995; Singh et al., 1998b; Abdel-Fattah et al., 2000). Two reports are known concerning the use of thermotolerant yeasts in regular industrial ethanol production: Kluyveromyces marxianus  IMB3 (Singh et al., 
1998a) and S. cerevisiae  F111 (Abdel-Fattah et al., 2000). W ati et al. (1996) 
isolated and characterized some thermotolerant mutants of haploid strains of S. cerevisiae  by physical and chemical methods of mutagenesis. Protoplast 
fusion of two yeast strains has been used to obtain a thermotolerant ﬂ  occulat-
ing strain of S. cerevisiae  KF-7 (Kida et al., 1992). Further studies on this 
ﬂ occulating strain suggested stability in repeated-batch fermentation (Shou 
et al., 1995) and ethanol production by repeated-batch fermentation in a molasses medium with improved osmotolerance (Morimura et al., 1997) at 35°C.
Hansenula anomala  J 45-N-5, a mutant, is also suitable for the treatment 
of distillery wastewater (Moriya et al., 1990). Ohta et al. (1988) discussed the BIOTECHNOLOGY 103104 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
temperature-sensitive mutant of a thermotolerant yeast, Hansenula polymor-
pha. Production of ethanol by Escherichia coli  carrying genes from Zymomo-
nas mobilis  has been demonstrated (Lawford and Rousseau, 1991). Additional 
substrate abilities to utilize pentoses and hexoses for ethanol production have been revealed by genetically engineered Saccharomyces  (Ho et al., 1998) and 
strains of S. cerevisiae  expressing XYL1 and XYL2 from Pichia stipitis  with 
or without expression of TAL1 (Meinander et al., 1999). Such strains can also lead to reduction in the COD of stillage during fermentation. Tremendous scope exists for the identiﬁ  cation, sequencing, and expression of different 
genes speciﬁ  c for decolorization of melanoidins or vinasses in various strains 
of yeasts or fungi. Kanda and Kuwahara (1991) reported on the breeding of higher glycerol-producing mutants from allyl alcohol– and pyrazole-resistant S. cerevisiae  K-7 and its haploid strain. Respiratory deﬁ  ciency is noted in all 
higher glycerol-producing mutants obtained from allyl alcohol–resistant K-7 diploids. However, the other higher glycerol-producing mutants (pyrazole resistant from K-7 diploids and allyl alcohol resistant from K-7 haploids) are not respiratory deﬁ  cient. These mutants produce more glycerol than K-7 and 
the same ethyl alcohol as K-7. However, more research is required for the breeding of excellent yeasts for use in distillery wastewater treatment.
Recent advances in molecular microbial ecology have advocated a variety 
of new tools to assess directly the microbial diversity present in natural habi-tats (Head et al., 1998) without microbial enrichment. However, the yeasts in ethanol fermentations or in melanoidin decolorization bioreactors have not been well characterized. Cocolin et al. (2000) presented a method to charac-terize the yeast diversity in wine fermentations by employing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–ampliﬁ  ed 26S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. This method can also be used 
in direct proﬁ  ling of the yeast dynamics in melanoidin fermentations. PCR-
DGGE can assess the populations of yeast diversity in fermentation as low a s  1 0 0 0  c e l l s / m l ,  t h u s  r e p r e s e n t i n g  a n  a t t r a c t i v e  a l t e r n a t i v e  t o  t r a d i t i o n a l  plating methods.
3.13 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The purpose of treatment of variable distillery wastewater is to discharge 
colorless efﬂ  uent to receiving water bodies or to dispose of them on land, 
which ever is acceptable to the public. The decolorization of melanoidin pig-ments is the major concern. Certain physical, chemical, and thermal methods have been used but are unsuitable in commercial applications. Highly suc-cessful and popular stillage treatments use anaerobic digestion to reduce COD, BOD, and methane production, but involve high installation and imple-mentation costs.
Considerable success has been achieved by the use of fungi in the treatment 
of distillery and brewery wastes. More factors affecting the efﬁ  ciency of fungal fermentation, higher decolorization yields, and COD and BOD removal 
in distillery and brewery efﬂ  uents are yet to be discovered and optimized. 
Development of the treatment system must consider dilution of the MSW. Optimizing conditions for melanoidin color removal by immobilized Pha-
nerochaete chrysosporium  have a potential for bioremediation of MSW 
wastewater (Fahy et al., 1997). A biological decolorization process with Fla-
vodon ﬂ  avus  can be implemented on a large scale in shallow ponds and reac-
tors in the presence of a high oxygen content (Raghukumar and Rivonkar, 2001). Color removal under a wide range of nutrient conditions is an added advantage. Decolorization of MSW using this fungus can also be integrated into the efﬂ  uent treatment system prior to primary and secondary treatments. 
Fungal treatment reduces COD levels, and further reduction in COD can be achieved during primary and secondary treatments. A combination of treat-ment processes can result in effective mycoremediation of highly recalcitrant MSW wastewaters.
Various fungal bioreactors for stillage treatment were discussed in the 
foregoing paragraphs. Cheaper and natural substrate sources have been con-sidered and can be substituted for synthetic and expensive sources. A process should be devised to extend biomass activity for a longer period, to minimize nutrients, and to handle a large volume of unsterilized spent wash. A shorter cultivation period, an easy method of cultivation, and minimum precautions against bacterial contamination must also be taken into account in the feasi-bility of a continuous system. All these conditions can add knowledge toward a realistic approach to treatment without additional cost. By optimizing these conditions, suitable and efﬁ  cient bioreactor conﬁ  gurations to exploit the bio-
remediation capacities of fungi along with prolonged operational stabilities can be developed, resulting in a high rate of melanoidin degradation and decolorization efﬁ  ciency.
Scanty reports exist on the role of certain enzymes for melanoidin decol-
orization, and a complete enzymatic system for the decolorization of mela-noidin is far from established. In certain cases, a certain percentage of color adsorption to fungal mycelia has been documented. A new horizon on the role of speciﬁ  c mediators or inducers related to the enhancement of enzyme 
activity for melanoidin decolorization can be opened. Little is known as to the mechanism of action of melanoidin degradation, and further studies on this subject are required. Modeling studies on molasses decolorization are also few. Moreover, methods to reduce toxicity of molasses can open doors to innovative treatments. The lack of general availability of this knowledge is limiting commercial applications of fungal treatments.
Fungal treatment of distillery and brewery wastewater is of great signiﬁ  -
cance because this procedure produces a valuable by-product along with molasses decolorization and removal of COD and BOD. This by-product is a single-cell protein (SCP), especially important for countries that have a scarcity of protein resources. The other process of economic importance is that yeasts utilize toxic and inhibitory components, such as acetate and lactate, CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 105106 FUNGAL TREATMENT OF DISTILLERY AND BREWERY WASTES
resulting in ethanol production, and consequently, the efﬂ  uent can be recycled 
as diluting water in a fermentor (Shojaosadati et al., 1999). This process reduces water consumption for dilution of molasses and the volume of resid-ual stillage by 70% and offers more economic beneﬁ  ts for further treatment. 
The proﬁ  ts due to annual ethanol production capacity are increased signiﬁ  -
cantly, while the need for cooling water is eliminated.

FUNGAL METABOLISM OF 
PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
4.1 INTRODUCTION
There has been growing public concern regarding the release of petroleum 
hydrocarbons into the environment. Petroleum hydrocarbons are known to enter the environment frequently and in large volumes via several routes. One of the major and natural routes is the seepage from natural deposits that leads to the appearance of petroleum oil in marine environments. Another route includes production, storage, and transportation, which involves a signiﬁ  cant 
potential for the accidental release of petroleum hydrocarbons. During the last decade, numerous incidents have been documented of petroleum leakage from underground storage tanks and pipelines. Marine spills also are a major source of water and coastal contamination.
Oil spills have become a global problem. Oil spills over 37 800 liters 
(34 000 kg) are reported in the International Oil Spill Database, which lists approximately 1.14 × 10
6 m3 (1.02 × 109 kg) of oil spilled into U.S. marine 
waters since the early 1960s. This occurred in 826 incidents involving tankers, barges, and other vessels (Etkin, 1998) and about 0.76 × 10
6 m3 (0.68 × 109 kg) 
of oil spilled onto U.S. soil from land pipelines (Etkin, 1997b). Estimated oil spills of 1.9 × 10
6 m3 (1.7 × 109 kg) and over 0.76 × 106 m3 (0.68 × 109 kg) from 
tankers have been reported in Europe (Etkin, 1997c) and Asia since 1965 (Etkin, 1997a). Oil spills over 37 000 liters (34 000 kg) into U.S. marine waters

from 1960 to 1997, including the number of spills and the amount spilled 
annually have been tabulated by Wang et al. (1999a).
Products derived from petroleum constitute the major source of energy for 
industry in and daily life (Harayama et al., 1999). Petroleum is also employed as a raw material in various products, such as cosmetics, paints, and plastics. Large quantities of petroleum oils and petroleum products enter marine and terrestrial environments, causing serious long-term concern regarding all forms of life and natural resources. Hundreds of papers have been published on the sources and impacts of spilled oils and petroleum products. Biodegra-dation of petroleum hydrocarbons in freshwater, terrestrial, and marine envi-ronments has been an area of intense interest and the subject of reviews by several authors (Prince, 1993; Atlas, 1995; Head and Swannell, 1999; Reddy and Quinn, 2001).
4.2 FATE OF OIL IN THE ENVIRONMENT
The quality and quantity of hydrocarbon mixtures and the properties 
of the affected ecosystem determine the persistence of petroleum hydrocar-bons. In one environment hydrocarbons may persist for months, whereas under different environmental conditions the same hydrocarbons can degrade within a few hours or days. Low rates of biodegradation occur in nature and are limited by environmental factors (Bartha and Atlas, 1987). The daily rates of natural hydrocarbon degradation in adapted communities and pristine marine water are 0.5 to 50 g/m
3 and less than 0.03 g/m3,
respectively.
Bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants in marine habi-
tats is usually limited by abiotic factors such as molecular oxygen and con-centrations of nitrogen and phosphate. In anaerobic sediments, the rates of petroleum biodegradation are negligible, due to a lack of molecular oxygen, which is generally required for most microorganisms as an initial step in hydrocarbon metabolism. Marine habitats are not deﬁ  cient in well-aerated 
oxygen.
The fate and behavior of spilled oil in natural environments are inﬂ  uenced 
by a number of physicochemical and biological factors, including evaporation, dissolution, photooxidation, microbial degradation, and interaction between oil and sediments. Physicochemical factors, such as volatilization, photolysis, sorption, dispersion, and mechanical emulsiﬁ  cation, play an important role 
in petroleum biodegradation. The combination  of these processes, known as 
weathering , reduces the concentration of hydrocarbons and causes changes in 
the chemical and physical properties of spilled oils. Alterations in the chemi-cal composition of spilled oils has led to profound changes in the toxicity of oil and the biological impact of oil over time. The issue of biogenic and pyro-genic hydrocarbons from petrogenic hydrocarbons has been explored (Wang et al., 1999a).4.3 COMPOSITION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
Petroleum hydrocarbons contain a complex mixture of compounds that can 
b e  c a t e g o r i z e d  i n t o  f o u r  f r a c t i o n s :  s a t u r a t e s ,  a r o m a t i c s ,  a s p h a l t e n e s ,  a n d  resins. The saturated fraction consists of straight-chain alkanes (normal alkanes), branched alkanes (isoalkanes), and cycloalkanes (naphthenes). The aromatic fraction includes volatile monoaromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes; polyaromatic hydrocarbons; naphthenoaro-matics; and aromatic sulfur compounds, such as thiophenes and dibenzothio-phenes. The asphaltene (phenols, fatty acids, ketones, esters, and porphyrins) and resin (pyridines, quinolines, carbazoles, sulfoxides, and amides) fractions consist of polar molecules containing N, S, and O
2. Asphaltenes are large 
molecules dispersed in oil in a colloidal manner, whereas resins are amor-phous solids truly dissolved in oil. The relative distribution of these fractions depends on many factors, such as the source, age, geological history, migra-tion, and alteration of crude oil. Hydrocarbons sensitive to microbial attack rank in the following order of decreased susceptibility: n-alkanes > branched 
alkanes > low-molecular-weight aromatics > cyclic alkanes. The saturate frac-
tion shows the highest rates of biodegradation, followed by light aromatics, with high-molecular-weight aromatics and polar compounds exhibiting the lowest rates of degradation. However, this pattern is not universal. A greater degradation loss of naphthalene than hexadecane in water–sediment mixtures from a freshwater lake (Cooney et al., 1985) and extensive biodegradation of alkylaromatics prior to detectable changes in the n-alkane proﬁ  le in marine 
sediments (Jones et al., 1983) have been observed. Marine microbes also attack aromatic hydrocarbons during the degradation of crude oil. The vari-ability in composition among crude oils and reﬁ  ned products contributes to 
the overall rate of biodegradation of both oil and its component fractions. Leahy and Colwell (1990) have reported the results of some of the examples.
Due to the presence of several compounds of complex structures, an 
increase in resistance of the residual mixture to further biodegradation occurs with progression of the biodegradation. Complete degradation of crude oils never occurs; a complex residue always remains. This residue, which is the color of black tar, contains a high proportion of asphaltic constituents. The residual mixture usually exhibits very low toxicity and bioavailability as long as it does not suffocate an area (Atlas, 1995).
4.4 METHODS OF ANALYSIS OF 
PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
A wide variety of instrumental and noninstrumental techniques have been 
established for the analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons. These include gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), METHODS OF ANALYSIS OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS 117118 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), size-exclusion HPLC, 
supercritical ﬂ  uid chromatography (SFC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), 
infrared spectroscopy (IR), isotope radio mass spectrometry, and gravimetric techniques. Among these, the GC techniques are the most widely used. One of the most enhanced techniques is capillary GC-MS, which can be used to analyze oil-speciﬁ  c biomarker compounds and polycyclic hydrocarbons. Cur-
rently, advances in computer technology have improved and optimized the accuracy and precision of data-handling capability, analytical data, and quality assurance/quality control.
Analytical techniques for the characterization of heavy oil contamination 
from soil matrices, including applications and limitations together with 90 references, are discussed by Whittaker et al. (1995). Sauer and Boehm (1995) presented a technical guide to chemical methods, including a tiered analytical approach, applications, and limitations together with over 110 references. Rapid HPLC methods (Krahn et al., 1993) and analytical techniques for fractionation and determination of hydrocarbon classes and groups, together with 109 references (Lundanes and Greibrokk, 1994), have been reviewed. The use of forensic environmental geochemistry (FEG) techniques in distin-guishing various hydrocarbon fuels and solvents in samples has been described (Kaplan et al., 1997). Wang et al. (1999a) consolidated recent developments and advances in chemical and biomarker ﬁ  ngerprinting and data interpreta-
tion techniques, including 201 references. This includes the relative distribu-tion pattern of petroleum hydrocarbons, analysis of “source-speciﬁ  c marker” 
compounds, diagnostic ratios of biomarkers, carbon isotope ratio measure-ments, principal component analysis and multivariate statistical analyses, and emerging techniques related to petroporphyrins and enantiomer analyses. Evolution of petroleum chemical ﬁ  ngerprinting techniques and new approaches 
to the characterization and differentiation among different petroleum sources have been discussed (Boehm et al., 1997). Wang and Fingas (1997) provided a brief survey and comparison of chemical ﬁ  ngerprinting techniques for the 
characterization of petroleum hydrocarbons, identiﬁ  cation of oil spills, and 
assessment of environmental impacts. The total organic carbon (TOC) is used to screen soil samples for oil contamination. Morselli et al. (1999) presented a method of supercritical ﬂ  uid extraction (SFE) for the determination of 
petroleum hydrocarbons in soil. The Site Characterization and Analysis Cone Penetrometer System (SCAPS) sensor technology is used for indirect detec-tion of dense non-aqueous-phase liquid (DNAPL) plumes at the site (Kram, 1998). Tracy (1997) discussed immunoassay technology to screen oil contami-nation. Several ﬁ  eld kits, such as the immunoassay-based EnviroGard, tur-
biditimetric-based PetroFlag test, and DR/2000 ﬁ  eld kits have been evaluated 
as ways to measure total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and have been found to have certain limitations (Lambert et al., 2001).4.5 ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES
Bioremediation is a very effective and promising technology for the treatment 
o f  pe tr o l e um  h y dr ocar bo n  co n tamin a ti o n.  H o w e v e r ,  b i o r e m edi a ti o n  is  s i t e-speciﬁ  c, and feasibility studies are required before the implementation of 
full-scale remediation. Bioremediation is a slow process and has many advan-tages, but it presents a challenge due to the heterogeneity of the contaminants, the presence of extreme concentrations of hydrocarbons, and variable site environmental conditions. Cleanup of petroleum-contaminated soils and aquifers is a priority task, due to the threat posed to soil fertility, drinking water, and groundwater (ASTM, 1995). A wide variety of physical, chemical, and biological technologies have been established for the decontamination of petroleum-contaminated sites (National Research Council, 1994; Alleman and Leeson, 1999). Of these technologies, engineered in situ bioremediation has received wide acclaim because it requires little energy, preserves the soil structure, and can detoxify the contaminants. Complete mineralization of hydrocarbons to innocuous end products is usually preferred compared to partial degradation to metabolites whose fate and effects are not known. In addition, the transfer of contaminants from one phase to another is not desir-able for any successful remediation strategy. Engineered in situ bioremedia-tion usually requires the stimulation of indigenous microﬂ  ora by oxidants and 
nutrients. Petroleum can be degraded under aerobic and/or anaerobic condi-tions, but rapid degradation occurs under aerobic conditions.
During the last two decades, different soil and groundwater technologies 
related to the cleanup of petroleum hydrocarbons have been developed. Table 4.1 lists various treatment technologies for the removal or degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater. Each treatment technology has certain limitations and advantages at a given site. Norris et al . (1994) 
discussed design concepts for various types of bioremediation. The U.S. Envi-ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also published several monographs on different technologies, which can be useful in the cleanup of petroleum-contaminated sites. Modeling these technologies to achieve the removal efﬁ  -
ciencies of contaminants is also described. Conversions of heavy crude oils can be induced, due to the action of microorganisms over periods of time or by the action of introduced microorganisms. Natural attenuation had become a popular and preferred cost-effective remedy for the degradation of hydro-carbons by the end of the last decade. Another cost-effective remedy is phy-toremediation, which has also received wide public acclaim (McCutcheon and Schn oo r , 2003). P ezeshki e t al. (2000) pr o vi ded an o v e rvi e w o f th e r o l e o f marsh macrophytes in the cleanup of petroleum hydrocarbons.

fungi is a function of the ecosystem and local environmental conditions. 
Bacteria and yeasts are generally predominant hydrocarbon degraders in the aquatic ecosystems, while fungi and bacteria are the main degraders in soil environments. However, yeasts and fungi have a signiﬁ  cant effect on oil deg-
radation, which occurs only under conditions that select against bacterial growth. A few studies are known that compare the level of hydrocarbon decomposition by bacteria and fungi in marine environments. Walker and Colwell (1974) reported the utilization of model petroleum at 0 and 5°C by bacteria, at 10°C by yeasts, and none by ﬁ  lamentous fungi. A hydrocarbon-
utilizing fungus, Cladosporium resinae , degrades 20 to 40% of petro -
leum when added to the inoculum. The yeast populations increase in oil-contaminated estuarine sediments over a 4-month period but decline in open ocean waters in the presence of oil (Ahearn and Meyers, 1972). S c i e n t i s t s  n o w  a c c e p t  t h a t  n o  s i n g l e  s p e c i e s  o f  m i c r o o r g a n i s m s  w i l l  c o m -pletely degrade any particular oil but this involves a consortium of microorganisms.
Hydrocarbon-utilizing yeasts and fungi are widely distributed in marine, 
freshwater, and soil habitats. Fungi constitute a minority in the marine envi-ronments, with increasing counts in nearshore regions, the intertidal zone, and salt marshes and mangrove areas. Ahearn and Meyers (1972) reported higher occurrences of yeasts and molds in rivers and lakes than in the ocean. Twenty-seven hydrocarbon-utilizing fungi from the marine environment (Floodgate, 1984) and 31 genera from soils (Bossert and Bartha, 1984) have been compiled. Common marine isolates are species of Aureobasidium ,
Candida ,Rhodotorula ,Mortierella ,Trichoderma , and others. Kirk and Gordon (1988) added the marine beach-adapted genera Corollospora ,Den-
dryphiella ,Lulworthia , and Varicosporina . Recently, fungal cultures inocu-
lated on ceramic support media have shown an ability to degrade vapor-phase volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as their sole carbon and energy sources (Qi et al., 2002).
No authentic work is known on the existence of fungi on the surface of the 
ocean for a long time or at a 1-cm depth for petroleum degradation in nature. It is likely that degradation rates are different in arctic and temperate marine samples of fungi. The number of hydrocarbon-utilizing fungi is generally lower in winter than in summer. Fragmentary studies have shown a rise in population of fungi after oil spills. This indicates that certain fungi develop an enzymatic system after long contact with hydrocarbons. Pinholt et al. (1979) studied the microbial changes in soil during oil decomposition. They found an increase from 60% to 82% in oil-utilizing fungi. The minor role of fungi in a marine ecosystem can be attributed to lack of sporulation in marine habitats and morphological features for competitiveness in aquatic milieu and inhibition of spore germination by salinity. On the contrary, Kohlmeyer and Kohlmeyer (1979) reported the completion of the life cycle of several hundred species of obligate and facultative marine fungi in saline habitats and produced spore ornamentation that assist dispersal and colonization in seawater.
The ubiquitous distribution of Cladosporium resinae  i s  k n o w n  i n  o i l -
contaminated environments (Ahearn and Meyers, 1972). This distribution of yeasts and fungi suggests their important role in the degradation of oil spills in the environments. The application of waste oil to soil promotes the growth of Graphium  and Paecilomyces spp. (Llanos and Kjoller, 1976). A group of 
terrestrial fungi (i.e., strains of Acremonium ,Graphium ,Fusarium ,Penicil-
lium ,Paecilomyces ,Trichoderma , and members of Sphaeropsidales) are 
capable of degrading crude oil hydrocarbons. Application of oil to soil pro-duces changes in types of fungi (Westlake et al., 1978). Davies and Westlake (1979) found no relationship between the ability of yeasts and fungi to grow on pure n-alkane or naturally occurring whole crude oils containing these 
compounds. Oil-utilizing strains of Aspergillus versicolor ,Cephalosporium 
acremonium ,Cunninghamella elegans , and a Penicillium  sp. from estuarine 
mud have been isolated (Cerniglia and Perry, 1973). About 96% (weight basis) of parafﬁ  n oil was utilized by strains of C. elegans  during a 5-day 
period. Cladosporium resinae  grows rapidly on n-alkanes and jet fuels (Cofone 
e t  al . ,  1 97 3 ).  Ah e arn  an d  M e y e rs  ( 1 97 6 )  e s ta b lis h e d  th e  r o l e  o f  y e as ts  an d  fungi in the removal of hydrocarbon from oil-contaminated environments.

fungal population capable of degrading target contaminants. Prior exposure FUNGAL METHODS OF ASSESSMENT 121122 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
of contamination to an ecosystem has been correlated with hydrocarbon 
degraders. Unlike bacterial methods, less is known regarding fungal methods for bioremediation assessment. These methods are summarized below.
4.7.1 Fungal Enumeration
Preliminary analyses of the total heterotrophic and speciﬁ  c hydrocarbon-
degrading fungal counts can provide a good understanding of soil biological conditions and the extent of acclimatization of indigenous fungal populations to site conditions. These indicate the viability of indigenous fungal population capable of supporting bioremediation. In addition to the preliminary analy-ses, monitoring fungal populations during soil remediation is important to discern fungal activity in hydrocarbon degradation. The literature to enumer-ate petroleum-degrading yeasts and fungi is inadequate and confusing. Sturman et al. (1995) discussed microbial enumeration methods, including heterotrophic plate counts, epiﬂ  uorescence direct counts, hydrocarbon-
degrader plate counts, most probable number (MPN) techniques, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) probes, lipid assays, metabolic indicators, and radio-isotopic methods. Many of these methods are known for the enumeration of petroleum-degrading yeasts and fungi. Candida albicans  OD-2 has been mea-
sured by direct counts (Fuentes et al., 1998). [
3H]Thymidine uptake, micro-
autoradiography, 2-( p-iodophenyl)-3-( p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium 
chloride (INT)-reduction, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the frequency of dividing cells are employed to assess yeast activity.
Acidiﬁ  ed wort agar is employed for the enumeration of yeasts introduced 
in the soil (Kulichevskaya et al., 1995). Fungi are also isolated by placing small pieces of tar balls on the surface of potato dextrose agar, V-8 agar, and Gorodkowa’s media (Snellman et al., 1988). A basal salts medium is used for the growth of fungi on fuel oils. Cladosporium resinae  is grown in a vortex-
mixed 1.5-L fermentor in a mineral salts solution (Lindley and Heydeman, 1986). Fedorak et al. (1984) explored yeasts and fungi using Sabouraud’s agar prepared in artiﬁ  cial seawater and provided a distribution of yeast and fungal 
colony-forming units (CFU) in marine samples. Artiﬁ  cial seawater agar 
slants, each with different carbon and petroleum sources, were prepared to study patterns of substrate utilization (Kirk and Gordon, 1988). Malt-agar chloramphenicol medium for the growth of fungal populations and media speciﬁ  c for hydrocarbon-adapted fungi (HAF) have also been employed 
(Oudot e t al., 1993). Mal t is the source of carbon in the ﬁ  rst medium, and 
hydrocarbons for HAF medium. A slant culture method has been used for the assimilation of n-hexadecane by yeast (Middelhoven et al., 2000). Mid-
delhoven et al. (1992) employed yeast enrichment methods for benzene deg-radation in acidic soils. A mixture of kerosene and automotive gas oil was evaluated for routine enrichment for the isolation of a yeast strain (Okpokwasili and Amanchukwu, 1988).
A yeast medium was considered for the isolation of heterotrophic yeasts 
and fungi by Walker and Colwell (1974, 1976), who also enumerated the counts of petroleum-degrading yeasts and fungi and the efﬁ  ciency of various 
media (SGO, MPN, yeast agar, and OA No. 2) from estuarine and marine samples. Washing the inoculum did not improve the recovery of petroleum degraders. Marine arenicolous fungi were also enumerated (Kirk, 1983).
4.7.2 Respirometric Tests
Mineralization studies involving the measurement of total CO
2production is 
a useful source of knowledge on the potential of hydrocarbon degradation in contaminated soils. This approach provides a rapid test for the determination of various biological treatment options, such as the effect of nutrient addition and fungal inoculation. This test is also used to conﬁ  rm active hydrocarbon 
degradation during full-scale bioremediation. Simple respirometric ﬂ  ask 
methods or expensive automated equipment for several samples simultane-ously can be employed for the monitoring of O
2 consumption and/or CO 2
evolution rates. The Biometer ﬂ  ask test can be conducted to assess mineral-
ization rates from a small amount of soil (Balba et al., 1998).
A radiorespiratory method using n-[1-14C]hexadecane and [9-
14C]phenanthrene veriﬁ  ed the mineralization of aliphatic compounds by ﬁ  la-
mentous fungi (April et al., 2000). A method was given for the recovery of 
14C in aqueous, organic, and cell fractions following incubation of fungi in 
a liquid culture with a crude oil spiked with n-[1-14C]hexadecane or [9-
14C]p h e n a n t h r e n e .  B o t t l e s  c l o s e d  w i t h  s i l i c o n  s t o p p e r s  w e r e  u s e d  t o  d e t e r -
mine the rate of respiration, and the evolution of CO 2 was measured after an 
hour of incubation (Kulichevska ya et al., 1995). Radiorespirometric studies can be performed to produce 
14CO 2 from 14C-labeled hydrocarbons by nine 
fungal and three yeast isolates in a ﬂ  ask (Fedorak et al., 1984). Mineralization 
of hexadecane was also studied by radiorespirometry using fungal strains (Kirk and Gordon, 1988).
4.7.3 Soil Microcosm Tests
Soil microcosm tests can be conducted in simple jars of contaminated soil 
from highly sophisticated systems. Good results are expected when real envi-ronmental conditions are incorporated in the model of microcosm design. These tests include sterile treatments as appropriate controls to separate the effects of abiotic hydrocarbon loss from actual biodegradation. Such tests are employed to assess the biodegradation potential and development of models for predicting the fate of hydrocarbons. Mathematical equations can be for-mulated to describe the kinetics of each process involving the transformation of constituents of speciﬁ  c hydrocarbons. The rate of degradation and meta-
bolic products can be monitored.
A soil microcosm test using fungi has been designed by Yateem et al. 
(1998). A spreading technique was employed to enumerate the total viable aerobic microorganisms in the soil extract and its serial dilutions. The experi-ments were conducted in eight 4-L sterilized glass ﬂ  asks loaded under a FUNGAL METHODS OF ASSESSMENT 123124 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
laminar ﬂ  o w  b e n c h  wi t h  1  k g  o f  c o n t amin a t e d  s o il  ( Co l o m b o  e t  a l . ,  1 996 ).  
Three treatments were tested for the inﬂ  uence of temperature on abiotic and 
biotic hydrocarbon loss in soil using the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (Margesin 
and Schinner, 1997). The water content was adjusted with sterile water to 60% of a soil’s maximum water-holding capacity. Competition experiments conducted with n-alkane utilizers, yeasts, and bacteria conﬁ  rmed the over-
growth of yeasts over bacteria in sandy soil (Schmitz et al., 2000). Acidiﬁ  ca-
tion favors the colonization of yeasts. It can be counteracted by the addition of bentonite. Different strains of yeasts reveal different levels of competitive-ness. Strains of Arxula adeninivorans ,Candida maltosa , and Yarrowia lipo-
lytica  showed more overgrowth than did strains of Candida tropicalis ,Candida 
shehatae , or Pichia stipitis . Two strains of C. maltosa  and Y. lipolytica  coex-
isted during several serial transfers under microcosm conditions.
Candida lipolytica  has been introduced in oil-contaminated soils for popu-
lation dynamics (Kulichevskaya et al., 1995). Soil is moistened to 60% of its total moisture capacity mixed with crude oil (0.1 cm
3/g soil) and mineral salts. 
Soil is inoculated with lyophilized biomass to a concentration of 3 mg/g soil, which corresponds to a population density of 10
8 cells/g soil. Soils are placed 
in diff er en t bo ttles and incuba ted a t 22°C f or 40 da ys wi th h umidi ty main-tained at a constant level.
4.7.4 Miscellaneous Tests
Other tests (i.e., dehydrogenase activity and biomarker compounds) are used 
for microbial assessment (Balba et al., 1998). The assay of dehydrogenase in contaminated soil indicates the possible inhibitory effect of contaminants on a soil’s microbial activities. The ratios of hydrocarbon compounds within a complex hydrocarbon mixture can be employed to assess hydrocarbon deg-radation. Unfortunately, no studies are available on these tests by petroleum-utilizing yeasts and fungi.
4.8 HYDROCARBON METABOLISM BY YEASTS AND FUNGI
Bacteria and fungi exhibit different abilities to metabolize hydrocarbons. 
Both yeasts and bacteria show decreasing abilities to metabolize alkanes with increasing chain length. Filamentous fungi do not exhibit preferential degra-dation for a particular chain length. Similar patterns of hydrocarbon metabo-lism are known in bacteria and fungi, but there is considerable variability among individual isolates. Hyphal structures and increases in surface area allow better penetration of the hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-impregnated soil aggregates that may be anoxic internally. Many such species of fungi are xero- and osmotolerant. Certain fungi contain extracellular enzymes that may assist in the initial degradation of hydrocarbons. Yeast and fungal degrada-tion of petroleum hydrocarbons are noted in Table 4.2.TABLE 4.2 Yeast and Fungal Degradation of Petroleum Hydrocarbons

125126 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
A soil fungus, Cladophialophora  sp. strain T1, does not metabolize 
benzene, but alkylated benzenes such as toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes are degraded by a combination of assimilation and cometabolism (Prenafeta-Boldu et al., 2002). Degradation of para -xylene does not occur in complex 
BTEX mixtures, but 60% depletes when combined with toluene. 
1H-NMR 
metabolic proﬁ  les revealed the formation of phthalates as end products of 
ortho - and meta -xylenes. Substrate interactions of toluene, ethylbenzene, and 
xylenes indicate their degradation at the alkyl side chain by the monooxygen-ase enzyme. Fungi are well known to grow on the water-soluble fraction of petroleum fuels, but only aliphatic hydrocarbons support fungal growth. This appears to be the ﬁ  rst report of a fungus growing on aromatic hydrocarbons 
from a gasoline water-soluble fraction containing all six BTEX compounds. During the metabolism of toluene by Cladophialophora  sp. strain T1, hydrox-
ylation of toluene to benzyl alcohol and subsequent transformation to benzoic acid occurred prior to hydroxylation and cleavage of the aromatic ring (Prenafeta-Boldu et al., 2001).
Trichosporon veenhuisii  sp. nov., an alkane-assimilating anamorphic 
basidiomycetous yeast, has the ability to assimilate several aliphatic and aro-matic compounds as a sole source of carbon and energy (Middelhoven et al., 2000). Introduction of Candida lipolytica  into oil-contaminated soil can 
increase the rate of oil degradation (Kulichevskaya et al., 1995). An increase in rates of respiratory activity of yeasts associated with growth on oil-contain-ing hydrocarbons in all three oil-polluted soils has been observed. Gray forest soils provide the most favorable conditions for the development of introduced yeasts. In soddy-podzolic soil, active proliferation and oil degradation are retarded as a consequences of inadequate aeration by inadequate structuring and heavy mechanical composition of this soil. This demonstrates the sub-stantial intensiﬁ  cation of oil degradation in soil by the hydrocarbon-oxidized 
yeasts introduced. An ability to degrade hydrocarbons was noted in species of six orders of Ascomycetes (April et al., 2000). Species attacked compounds within the aliphatic fraction of crude oil, ranging from C12 to C26. All species degraded the aliphatic fraction of petroleum hydrocarbons. This was the ﬁ  rst 
report in mineralizing hydrocarbons by Neosartorya ﬁ  scheri ,Oidiodendron 
griseum , and Phialophora americana .
Three white-rot fungi (i.e., Phanerochaete chrysosporium ,Pleurotus 
ostreatus , and Coriolus versicolor ) were shown to have the ability to degrade 
oil in contaminated soil (Yateem et al., 1998). Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) were reduced considerably by all three fungal cultures after 4 months under nitrogen-rich conditions. P. chrysosporium  degraded all the BTEX 
components either individually or in a composite mixture (Yadav and Reddy, 1993). Degradation occurred under nonligninolytic conditions in malt extract medium in which extracellular lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) are not produced. In vitro studies by wild or mutant types also conﬁ  rmed that LiP and MnP are not involved in BTEX 
degradation. Uniform ring-labeled [
14C]benzene and [14C]toluene underwent greater mineralization to 14CO 2. Compared to natural soil microﬂ  ora, pure

In  g e n e r al,  Im pe rf ect  fun gi  iso la ted  fr o m  co n tami-nated soils show somewhat higher efﬁ  ciency. Three unadapted and indigenous 
species of ligninolytic fungi, such as Coriolopsis rigida ,P. ostreatus , and 
Trametes villosus , effectively and comparably degraded the aliphatic and 
aromatic components. Multivariate analysis of 22 parameters indicated a reactivity trend in the components during oil degradation as follows: low-molecular-weight n-alkanes > phenanthrene > 3,2-methylphenanthrenes >
intermediate-chain-length n-alkanes > longer-chain-length n-alkanes > iso-
prenoids ≈ 9,1-methylphenanthrenes. Irrespective of degrading capacity, all 
species of fungi exhibit this decomposition sequence.
Of seven strains of ﬁ  lamentous fungi, the H1 and H7 strains of Hormoco-
nis resinae  and the H3 and H4 strains of Penicillium  were shown to grow on 
derivatives of petroleum (Laborda et al., 1996). The molds degraded the n-
alkane components of fuel and H7 also degraded the branched hydrocarbons, pristane and phytane. Incubation with heating oil resulted in the detection of a large number of microbodies in the cytoplasm of H1 and H7, revealed by transmission electron microscopy. Several benzene compounds were assimi-lated by Imperfect ascomycete, Arxula adeninivorans  (Middelhoven et al., 
1991). Of several hydrocarbon-assimilating fungi, the most active strains in the assimilation of saturates and aromatics were shown to be Beauveria alba
and Penicillium simplicissimum  (Chaineau et al., 1999). Hydrocarbons were 
also assimilated by a species of Fusarium  (Nair and Lokabharathi, 1977).
Several strains of hydrocarbon-assimilating fungi were isolated from tropi-
cal environments, a forest soil, and the sediments of a river contaminated by petroleum spills in a study by Oudot et al. (1993). The most active strains exhibiting biodegradation of total petroleum exceeding 25% were Eupenicil-
lium javanicum ,Graphium putredinis , and Aspergillus ﬂ  avipes . These strains 
provided the most efﬁ  ciency in assimilation of saturates exceeding 40% and 
aromatics exceeding 30%. Emericella nidulans ,Eupenicillium javanicum ,
Gliocladium virens , and Aspergillus fumigatus  degraded the resins signiﬁ  -
cantly (15 to 28%). Emericella nidulans, Eupenicillium javanicum ,Graphium 
putredinis , and Acremonium  spp. degraded about 15 to 40% of asphaltenes. 
However, the petroleum resins and asphaltenes are considered as resistant or refractory to biodegradation. The mixed culture of the soil strains is as active as the most efﬁ  cient mono-speciﬁ  c cultures, whereas the mixed culture of the 
river strains is not very active. The activity is closer to Eupenicillium than to 
the best-performing strain of E. nidulans . This implies the nonpredominance 
of the most efﬁ  cient strain during competition of growth.

1988). W eathering showed a greater effect on kerosene than on automotive gas oil (AGO). The best carbon source for growth was AGO, followed by kerosene, alcohol, and acetaldehyde. This indicates the capability of growth HYDROCARBON METABOLISM BY YEASTS AND FUNGI 127128 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
of a soil yeast isolate on alcohols and aldehydes produced as a result of oxida-
tion of the hydrocarbons. This may be a potential candidate strain for seeding in the biodegradation of oil-polluted terrestrial ecosystems.
Several ﬁ  lamentous fungi were isolated from half of 300 tar balls collected 
from the North Atlantic and North Paciﬁ  c Oceans (Snellman et al., 1988). 
Tetracoccosporium  produced the greatest mycelia biomass. Both Lophot-
richus  and Tetracoccosporium  assimilated the components of fuel oil no. 4, 
irrespective of oil concentration. The ability of 54 strains in 30 species and 23  g e n e r a  o f  ﬁ  lamentous marine Ascomycetes and Deuteromycetes, repre-
senting arenicolous, caulicolous, and lignicolous fungi, to assimilate anthro-pogenic petroleum compounds has been examined (Kirk and Gordon, 1988). Of 18 arenicolous species, 14 showed growth on hexadecane as the sole carbon source. These species also mineralized the labeled hexadecane, releasing 
14CO 2. None of nine caulicolous and only three of 27 lignicolous marine fungi 
showed growth on hexadecane as a carbon source. The 14 arenicolous and three lignicolous species that exhibited growth on hexadecane also assimi-lated 1-hexadecane, pristane, and to a lesser extent, tetradecane as sole carbon sources. Zalerion maritimum  is the only species that utilized dodecane and 
decane, whereas Varicosporina ramulosa  formed asexual fruiting bodies on 
these hydrocarbons. Most of the hexadecane-utilizing species revealed emul-siﬁ cation after 6 weeks, implying the penetration of the hydrocarbon droplets 
by the mycelia. Of 224 fungi and 74 yeasts isolated from marine water and sediment samples, only 63 fungi and 3 yeast isolates utilized the n-alkane 
proﬁ le of crude oil (Fedorak et al., 1984). About a 50% reduction in the 
number of isolates was detected when the temperature was reduced from 20°C to 8°C and the incubation time was doubled. Of these, 47 isolates belong to the genera of Penicillium . Other isolates that showed an ability to grow on 
this oil belong to the genera Aspergillus ,Beauveria ,Paecilomyces , and Ver-
ticillium . Yeast blooms on the surface of oil slicks due to the growth of indig-
enous yeasts (Ahearn and Meyers, 1976). However, the growth of common marine yeasts is slow compared to that of yeasts isolated from aquatic eco-systems contaminated with oil. Geofungi revealed faster growth than that of marine species in culture (Kohlmeyer and Kohlmeyer, 1979). However, little is known about the ecological signiﬁ  cance of hydrocarbon-utilizing marine 
fungi, despite their richness, adaptiveness, and diversity of chemical activities.
Two fungal strains on crude oil as the sole source of carbon were exposed 
to three crude oils that showed a range of mutagenic activity by Rudd et al. (1996). Extracts of fungal incubation with the various crude oils were tested for mutagenic activity by spiral Salmonella  assay. Cunninghamella elegans  or 
Penicillium zonatum  degraded Pennsylvania crude oil and its mutagenicity 
was reduced signiﬁ  cantly. The moderately mutagenic West Texas Sour crude 
oil showed little change in mutagenicity during incubation with either of these fungi. The slightly mutagenic Swanson River Field crude oil from Cook Inlet, Alaska, became more mutagenic during incubation with Cunninghamella elegans . Measurement of mycelial mats during growth on crude oils indicated 
about 25% biodegradation of crude oil.
4.9 TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIP OF 
HYDROCARBON-UTILIZING YEASTS AND FUNGI
Yeasts and fungi are a diverse group of organisms for hydrocarbon utilization. 
B arth a  an d  A tl as  ( 1 977 )  lis t ed  1 4  g e n e r a  o f  fun gi  iso l a t ed  fr o m  an  a q ua ti c  environment that had been shown to utilize hydrocarbons. These included species of Candida ,Rhodotorula , and Sporobolomyces . Davies and Westlake 
(1979) studied the growth capability of 60 fungal isolates on n-tetradecane, 
toluene, naphthalene, and seven crude oils of various compositions. Forty cultures, including 28 soil isolates, exhibited growth on one or more of the crude oils. The common genera isolated from soils are those producing abun-dant small conidia (e.g., Penicillium  and Verticillium  spp.). Oil-degrading 
strains of Beauveria bassiana ,Mortierella  spp., Phoma  spp., Scolecobasidium 
obovatum , and Tolypocladium inﬂ  atum  were also isolated.
Certain yeasts strains (i.e., Candida ,Rhodotorula ,Saccharomyces ,Spo-
robolomyces , and Trichosporon ) capable of utilizing hydrocarbons have been 
isolated (Ahearn et al., 1971; Cook et al., 1973). Cladosporium resinae  iso-
lated from the soil (Cooney and Walker, 1973) was found to be a contaminant of jet fuels (Bailey and May, 1979). Komagata et al. (1964) studied 50% of yeasts for hydrocarbon-degrading ability and found 56 species that can utilize hydrocarbons, almost all belonging to the genus Candida .
The ability of yeasts and fungi to utilize hydrocarbons as the sole source 
of carbon and energy is well established in the literature. Fungi capable of utilizing hydrocarbons are limited to occur within the orders Mucorales (Zygomycetes) and Moniliales (Hyphomycetes). In general, isolates of genera Aspergillus and Penicillum are rich in assimilating hydrocarbons. These fungi 
also grow on n-parafﬁ  ns with 10 carbon atoms rather than on petroleum frac-
tions or aromatic compounds. More than 50% of the isolates belong to Hypo-creaceae and T richocomaceae in Ascomy cetes ( April et al., 2000). Both of these groups contain several species, which are osmo- as well as xerotolerant. The most xerotolerant species belong to the genus Aspergillus  and several 
species of Penicillium  and Fusarium . A high salt concentration can lead to 
low water availability by lowering the osmotic potential. Species of Aspergil-
lus and Penicillium  can also grow at a lower osmotic potential, −50 MPa (Dix 
and Webster, 1995). Pseudallescheria boydii , belonging to Microascaceae, is 
also osmotolerant, due to its growth at a high salt concentration of 2% NaCl and 5% MgCl
2 (de Hoog et al., 1994).
At present, the ability to utilize hydrocarbons is widespread among diverse 
fungal populations. Hydrocarbons are naturally occurring organic com-pounds, and it is not surprising that yeasts and fungi have evolved the ability to utilize these compounds. When natural ecosystems are contaminated with TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIP OF HYDROCARBON-UTILIZING YEASTS 129130 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
petroleum hydrocarbons, the indigenous microﬂ  ora is likely to contain fungal 
or microbial populations of differing taxonomic relationships that are capable of degrading the contaminating hydrocarbons.
4.10 FACTORS AFFECTING METABOLISM OF 
PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
The biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in the environment is deter-
mined largely by abiotic factors. Factors affecting microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons have been the subject of considerable interest during the past two decades. Fungi can withstand fairly wide ﬂ  uctuations 
in environmental conditions. The various factors that inﬂ  uence the growth 
rates and enzymatic activities of yeasts and fungi also affect the rates of petroleum degradation. Various factors inﬂ  uencing the fungal degradation 
of petroleum hydrocarbons have been recognized. These factors are divided into three categories: (1) physicochemical (physical nature, solubility, size and concentration, oil–water interface, volatility, etc.), (2) environmental (temperature, pH, light, salinity, oxygen level, nutrients, soil/sediment type, etc.), and (3) fungal (distribution in an area, population density adaptation, uptake, genetic composition, microbial interactions, etc.). Important factors affecting the fungal metabolism of petroleum hydrocarbons are summarized next.
4.10.1 Physical Nature
The physical nature of hydrocarbons has a great effect on the process of bio-
degradation. The hydrocarbon-degrading yeasts and fungi act primarily at the oil–water interface. However, yeasts and fungi can be found growing over the entire surface of an oil droplet, and growth does not occur within oil droplets in the absence of entrained water. The movement of emulsion drop-lets through a water column allows the uptake of oxygen, nutrients, and oil to fungi.
4.10.2 Temperature
Based on temperature, hydrocarbon degradation can occur under three con-
ditions: psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic. In general, most fungi are mesophilic in isolation, growth, and reproduction. Temperature is essen-tial for the growth requirements of certain yeasts and fungi along with petro-leum as a substrate. Low temperatures generally retard the rates of volatilization of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, some of which are toxic to yeasts and fungi. Fungi also show a propensity to withstand dry environ-ments and high temperatures and thus appear to be suitable for the remedia-tion of these contaminated areas. The effects of temperature are also considered with other factors, such as the quality of the hydrocarbon mixture 
and the composition of the fungal population.
Temperature inﬂ  uences diesel oil biodegradation by the psychrotrophic 
yeast Yarrowia lipolytica  in a mineral medium and in soil (Margesin and 
Schinner, 1997). Abiotic loss of diesel oil increases with incubation time and with temperature and is lower in a mineral medium than in soil. This amounts to a loss of 20 to 45% (5000 mg/kg soil dry weight) in soil and 15 to 27% in liquid media after 30 days at 4 to 30°C. Higher biodegradation activity is detected in liquid culture than in soil at all temperatures. Y. lipolytica  was 
shown to degrade about 20% of the diesel oil in soil. The degradation activity was highest at 10 to 15°C after 5 days and at 4°C after 10 days. BTEX degra-dation by Phanerochaete chrysosporium  w a s  h i g h e r  a t  2 5 ° C  t h a n  a t  3 7 ° C  
(Yadav and Reddy, 1993).
4.10.3 pH
Several fungi grow well at pH levels of 4 to 5 and yeasts at 3 to 4 and are more 
tolerant of acidic conditions, where it is difﬁ  cult for bacteria to thrive. Clado-
sporium resinae  grows slowly in seawater and requires organic stimulation for 
growth (Neihof and May, 1983). In certain cases, BTEX degradation by P. 
chrysosporium  is little affected by pH variations between 4.5 and 7.0 (Yadav 
and Reddy, 1993).
4.10.4 Oxygen
Fungi are both aerobic and anaerobic but grow well under aerobic conditions. 
Oxygen is necessary for the mineralization of hydrocarbons in estuarine sedi-ments. The rates of hydrocarbon degradation are reduced with decreasing oxygen reduction potential. Hydrocarbons persist in reduced sediments for longer periods than in aerated surface layers. The initial steps in the catabo-lism of aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic hydrocarbons by fungi involve oxidation of the substrate by oxygenases and molecular oxygen. Thus, aerobic condi-tions are necessary for the oxidation of hydrocarbons in the environment. Substantially greater degradation of all BTEX compounds occurs in static than in shaken liquid cultures (Y adav and Reddy , 1993). Negligible rates of biodegradation of hydrocarbons occur in anaerobic environments.
4.10.5 Nutrients, Dispersants, and Biosurfactants
Little is known about petroleum degradation in the presence of nutrients by 
yeasts and fungi. Low nitrogen levels, low pH, low moisture content, and inadequacy of certain nutrients favor the development of fungi. In oil slicks, a proportion of carbon is readily available for yeast growth within a limited area. Since nitrogen and phosphorus components are essential for incorpora-tion into yeast or fungal biomass, the availability of these nutrients within the FACTORS AFFECTING METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS 131132 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
hydrocarbon location is important. In many cases, the supply of nitrogen and 
phosphorus depends on the diffusion in the oil slick. The degradation of hydrocarbons can be accelerated by the addition of speciﬁ  c urea-phosphate, 
N-P-K fertilizers, and so on, for fungal growth. Fungal cells usually contain less nitrogen than bacterial cells and thus fungi can act favorably in ecosys-tems that have a low nitrogen content. Many fungal isolates grow equally well in laboratory diesel–water systems with or without an additive (Bento and Gaylarde, 2001). However, the composition of fungal cells can be represented empirically by C
10H17O6N.
Dispersants have demonstrated a positive effect on rates of degradation by 
dissolution and emulsiﬁ  cation of hydrocarbons. Fungal levels in analytical 
freshwater ponds are enhanced signiﬁ  cantly after the addition of oil–disper-
sant mixtures (Sherry, 1984). Some dispersants are toxic and inhibitory to yeasts and fungi. The use of natural biosurfactants produced by yeasts or fungi has a marked potential in such biospheres (Lindley, 1991, 1994). The chemical nature of biosurfactan ts produced by y easts appears to be that of glycolipids. The physical properties of such compounds play an important role i n  p e t r o l e u m  d e g r a d a t i o n .  T h e  m a j o r  a c t i o n  o f  t h e s e  b i o s u r f a c t a n t s  i s  t o  increase the available surface area of the hydrocarbon phase for uptake trans-port by fungi.
Yeast extract and malt extract enhance cell growth and overall n-alkane 
degradation by the polyethylene-degrading fungus Penicillium simplicissi-
mum  YP (Y amada-Onodera e t al., 2002). Sq ualane is more fa v orable than 
pristane to long-chain n-alkane degradation when the cell density is higher. 
The degradation efﬁ  ciency is enhanced further using Plysurf A210G as the 
dispersant and supplementing with a high concentration (0.3%) of malt extract. The fungus can also grow in the presence of pristane, squalane, and n-alkanes with a chain 20 to 50 carbons long. This fungus has a potential for 
application in bioremediation of contaminated areas containing recalcitrant long-chain alkanes.
4.11 FUNGAL MECHANISMS OF METABOLISM OF 
PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
Hydrocarbon-degrading fungi have been known for more than ﬁ  ve decades, 
but our understanding of mechanisms involved in the catabolic breakdown of hydrocarbons is still incomplete. Certain aspects of fungal metabolism of hydrocarbons are similar to the metabolism of both higher eukaryotic organ-isms and bacteria (Smith and Rosazza, 1974). Like bacteria, fungi participate in the transformation reactions and assimilate hydrocarbons as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide. The fungal mechanisms of metabolism of petroleum hydrocarbon have been discussed by many researchers and divided into four categories.4.11.1 Aliphatic Hydrocarbons
The most thoroughly studied aliphatic hydrocarbons are n-alkanes of C10 to 
C20 that can be metabolized rapidly. Methyl alkanes may also be metabolized but with less growth. The degradation of long-chain alkanes greater than C24 can occur in complex mixtures, but no major studies are known to support fungal growth. Kremer and Anke (1997) listed the alkane-assimilating genera of fungi.
As with most microorganisms, the most common major pathway of alkane 
metabolism is monoterminal oxidation  to the corresponding alcohol, alde-
hyde, and fatty acid. This involves a mixed function of alkane monoxygenase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent alcohol, and aldehyde dehydrogenases. The initial mode of attack is at the site of the terminal methyl group by alkane monoxygenase involving the insertion of molecular oxygen and an electron transfer system. This array involves the combination of cyto-chrome P450 as the terminal oxidase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-cytochrome P450-reductase as the electron transfer component. The following dehydrogenase steps to long-chain alcohols and aldehydes yield fatty acids. Fatty acids are also generated due to alkane assimilation to function as building blocks (Brakemeier et al., 1995). Further catabolism involves the initial activation of fatty acids to acyl-CoA ester via an acyl-CoA synthetase and β-oxidation and yields to acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-
CoA can either act as an anabolic precursor or is further catabolized to CO
2
via a tricarboxylic acid cycle. The possibility exists of terminal oxidation to the corresponding fatty acids followed by β-oxidation for alkane mineraliza-
tion in marine fungi (Singer and Finnerty, 1984). The slow alkane utilization by marine fungi indicates a lack of constitutive enzymes for the initial oxida-tion, and this requires further investigation.
Although a monoterminal pathway is most commonly encountered, certain 
species possess alternative pathways. Some yeasts and species of Aspergillus ,
Botrytis , and Penicillium  can oxidize both terminal methyl groups of aliphatic 
hydrocarbons to produce long-chain dicarboxylic acid, which is known as diterminal oxidation . This oxidation may occur either simultaneously or the 
ω-methyl group is oxidized after formation of the fatty acids. Several species 
of Candida  accumulate dioic acid on alkanes (Uchio and Shiio, 1972; 
Il’Chenko, 1984). This pathway has been exploited for the overproduction of dicarboxylic acid.
Another mechanism is subterminal oxidation , which is initiated in the 
formation of a secondary alcohol, followed by oxidation to the corresponding ketone and ester, which cleaves to yield both a primary alcohol and acetate. Subterminal oxidation is noted in species of Aspergillus ,Cladosporium ,Peni-
cillium ,Verticillium ,Cunninghamella echinulata ,Fusarium lini ,Mortierella 
isabellina , and Rhizopus nigricans , (Hoffmann and Rehm, 1976a; Hoffmann 
et al., 1977; Yi and Rehm, 1982; Kremer and Anke, 1997). Subterminal FUNGAL MECHANISMS OF METABOLISM 133134 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
oxidation can occur in various positions, with formation of a mixture of secon-
dary alcohols whose further metabolism yields the corresponding primary alcohols and organic acids. Further metabolism of alcohol employs steps of dehydrogenation and β-oxidation. A scheme of the various steps involved in 
alkane oxidation by Mucorales has also been proposed (Pelz and Rehm, 1973; Hoffmann and Rehm, 1976b).
4.11.2 Aromatic Hydrocarbons
The metabolism and transformation of aromatic hydrocarbons by fungi have 
been well established during the past two decades. Several species of fungi have shown the ability to assimilate a wide range of aromatic hydrocarbons. The oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons is initiated with an epoxidation to arene oxides by cytochrome P450–dependent monoxygenases. Several meta-bolic pathways are recognized for the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons (see Chapter 8).
4.11.3 Cooxidation of Hydrocarbons
In certain cases, fungi can initiate breaking or modifying complex hydrocar-
bons despite nonoccurrence of growth. Some degree of partial conversion may occur in the presence of an alternative substrate acting as a source of both carbon and energy. Few fungi can metabolize cycloalkanes. Certain studies did not show the toxicity of cycloalkanes to representative yeasts. The metabolism of cycloalkanes in fungi appears to proceed via cooxidation. Studies of fungi capable of growth on cyclic aliphatics are rare. Cyclohexane has no terminal methyl groups and is assimilated by a mechanism similar to subterminal oxidation (Perry, 1979). This mechanism involves the formation of dicarboxylic acid, which is subsequently metabolized by β-oxidation. The 
possibility of cooxidation of alkanes by lignicolous marine fungi is correlated, owing to much better growth on glucose with hydrocarbons (Kirk and Gordon, 1988).
4.11.4 Uptake of Hydrocarbons
The uptake of hydrocarbons involves penetration of insoluble substrate into 
a cell with a variety of mechanisms. One of the most acceptable mechanisms is via the transport process. Yeasts accumulate fatty acids within cell material, and ﬁ  lamentous fungi show intracellular aggregation of nonassimilated 
alkanes during conditions of excessive carbon. At the cell surface, penetration can occur through pores and channels, and hydrocarbon moves toward the plasmalemma. If the initial enzymes are present in the plasmalemma, the aldehydes or fatty acids may enter cytoplasm as a result of activation of hydro-carbons, but the cytochemical location of enzymes does not agree with such a mechanism.Membrane-bound, electron-dense inclusion bodies (vesicles) in Cladospo-
rium resinae  have been detected during growth on alkanes (Cooney et al., 
1980). Lindley and Heydeman (1986) described dodecane uptake by whole cells of C. resinae in two stages. Here, passive adsorption of the hydrocarbon 
to the outer cell surface follows by a mechanism that obeys Michaelis–Menten saturation kinetics. This two-stage uptake mechanism is similar to that of the yeast Candida tropicalis  (Kappeli and Fiechter, 1981). This yeast produces a 
fatty acid complex that emulsiﬁ  es the hydrocarbon and thus results an induced 
uptake of pure hydrocarbon. The alkane solubilization is indicated by an aqueous phase during transport by Candida lipolytica (Goma et al., 1973). 
Three steps of alkane metabolism are stated: adsorption to the cell surface, movement through the rigid cell wall via pores or channels, followed by alkane movement via pinocytosis to microbodies and other sites of oxidation (Singer and Finnerty, 1984). They also show the production of extracellular products in C. lipolytica , which induces both emulsiﬁ  cation and uptake of 
hydrocarbons. The exact nature of biochemical mechanism of alkane metabo-lism remains unknown, but the available knowledge suggests the involvement of the physicochemical nature of the cell wall. In eukaryotic microorganisms, hydrocarbon catabolism is associated with distinct and induced ultrastruc-tural characteristics (Fukui and Tanaka, 1979). The most important changes include the appearance of crystalline peroxisomes in yeasts and fungi. During alkane degradation by Candida  and other species, peroxisomes are induced 
in large proportions of the cell volume and in high numbers are similar to methylotrophic yeasts and unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The intracellular 
distribution of various biochemical pathways is located in diverse microbodies (peroxisomes, microsomes, and mitochondria) associated with alkane metab-olism in C. tropicalis (Tanaka et al., 1982).
4.12 OXIDATION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS BY 
FUNGAL ENZYMES
Little is known of the enzymatic oxidation of petroleum hydrocarbons, and 
this topic is emerging due to regio- and stereoselectivity and mild physiologi-cal conditions. Enzymatic oxidation can take the upper hand when success is not achieved with chemical catalysts. Faber (1997) discussed biocatalytic oxidation reactions of alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and heteroatoms. In general, these biotransformations are carried out by microbial cultures. Chol-oroperoxidase (CPO) has been employed for the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes and oleﬁ  ns (Dexter et al., 1995).
Laccase is well documented with a mediator to oxidize certain aromatic 
compounds. This is called mediated oxidation . Laccase from the white-
rot fungus Trametes hirsuta  is employed for the oxidation of alkenes 
(Niku-Paavola and Viikari, 2000). This oxidation is a two-step process: (1) the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of primary substrate, the mediator; and OXIDATION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS BY FUNGAL ENZYMES 135136 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
(2) the oxidized mediator oxidizes the secondary substrate, the alkene. All 
alkenes are oxidized, and the extent of transformation depends on the alkene and the mediator. The highest degrees of conversion are obtained using hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) as a mediator. Treatment at 20°C for 20 hours results in a 45 to 50% oxidation rate of α-pinene and, cis-2- and cis-3-hexenols 
and a 90 to 100% oxidation rate of linalool, geraniol, nerol, and cinnamyl alcohol. Other alkenes, such as allyl ether, cis-2-heptene, and cyclohexene, 
are oxidized less than 25%, even with all the mediators. The main reaction products of alkenes are aldehydes and ketones, but other products are also identiﬁ  ed.
4.13 CYTOCHROME P450 ENZYME SYSTEMS
During the past decade, the role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in several 
complex fungal bioconversions has been established (van den Brink et al., 1998). Cytochrome P450–mediated bioconversions in ﬁ  lamentous fungi 
involve assimilation of long-chain alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-bons (PAHs). A well-studied example of alkane assimilation involving P450 process is carried out by species of Candida  such as C. apicola ,C. maltosa ,
and C. tropicalis . These bioconversions are terminal hydroxylation of n-
alkanes and ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids. The monoxygenase system 
required for these reactions comprises several cytochrome P450s induced by alkanes (Seghezzi et al., 1991; Scheller et al., 1996). Comparable bioconver-sion reactions have also been examined in Yarrowia lipolytica  (van Dyk et 
al., 1994). Certain fungal cytochrome P450–encoding genes for alkane assim-ilation have been identiﬁ  ed and reviewed (van den Brink et al., 1998). Eight 
genes of a large cytochrome P450 gene family, cyp52 , in species of Candida
associated with n-alkane assimilation have been identiﬁ  ed. Substrate speciﬁ  c-
ity is different for each gene that reveals the capability of yeast to modify a range of different n-alkanes (Seghezzi et al., 1991; Scheller et al., 1996). 
Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR)–encoding genes are also identiﬁ  ed in 
Aspergillus niger ,Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,Schizosaccharomyces pombe ,
C. tropicalis , and Candida maltosa . Regulation of the expression of the fungal 
P450 cyp52  system in C. tropicalis  and C. maltosa  has also been examined.
The presence of multiple n-alkane-inducible forms of cytochromes P450 
(P450alk) that can catalyze terminal hydroxylation of n-alkanes in the assimi-
lation pathway has been demonstrated in C. maltosa  (Ohkuma et al., 1998). 
Eight structurally related P450alk genes are detected, and the function of four major isoforms of P450alk encoded by ALK1, ALK2, ALK3, and ALK5 g e n e s  w e r e  e x a m i n e d  b y  s e q u e n t i a l  g e n e  d i s r u p t i o n .  O h t o m o  e t  a l .  ( 1 9 9 6 )  reported the repression of four genes, ALK1, ALK2, ALK3, and ALK5, by glucose at the transcription level and transcriptionally activated in response to a peroxisome proliferator, cloﬁ  brate. A gene encoding cytochrome P450 
involved in n-alkane assimilation is cloned from Y. lipolytica  CX161–1B (Iida et al., 1998). The expression of the P450 gene Y1ALK1 is induced by 
n-tetradecane. A Y1ALK1 gene disruptant does not grow well on n-decane 
but shows growth on longer-chain n-alkane such as hexadecane. The decane 
u tiliz a ti o n  is  r e s t o r e d  b y  th e  in tr o d u cti o n  o f  Y 1ALK1  o n  a  p l as mi d  t o  th e  disruptant. This implies that the Y1ALK1 gene product is the major P450 to assimilate short-chain alkanes such as decane and dodecane. The isolation of more fungal P450 genes and their regulatory mechanisms and the cloning of regulatory proteins are essential for an understanding of their role in alkane metabolism. The P450 overproduction in fungi has a potential use in the enhancement of bioremediation of oil contaminants in the environment.
4.14 ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE
The fermentation strategies for a potential biotechnological process on petro-
leum hydrocarbons as substrates are well known and have tremendous bio-technology applications. These biotechnology applications are summarized below.
4.14.1 Single-Cell Protein
Much of the work on single-cell protein (SCP) was accomplished in the 
1970s and later abandoned due to marketing problems. Protein extracted from petroleum by some yeasts and fungi has been described (Humphrey, 1970). C. lipolytica  is used in the processing of alkane as a substrate for SCP 
(Whiteworth, 1974). Of 67 potential yeasts, C. tropicalis  and Y. lipolytica  are 
found to be excellent for SCP production on diesel oil as the sole source of carbon. Maximum yield has been shown to occur for a diesel oil concentration of 40 to 60 ml/l after 168 hours (Ashy and Abou-Zeid, 1982). A good source of protein was achieved through fermentation of hydrocarbon-derived SCP, and additional processing was required to remove undesirable components (Scrimshaw, 1984). Cloning and recombinant DNA techniques can be used to improve SCP production.
4.14.2 Surfactant Production
Fungi and yeasts produce a wide variety of surfactants, ranging from simple 
fatty acids and phospholipids by ﬁ  lamentous species to complex polymers by 
various yeasts. The extracellular phospholipids of Cladosporium resinae  are 
dodecanoic acid–substituted (Kan and Cooney, 1975). The most suitable substrate for phospholipid formation by Aspergillus  sp. is n-alkane C16 
(Miyazima et al., 1985). Yeasts produce surfactants that exhibit highly active emulsifying properties. Species of Torulopsis  produce glycolipids that show 
similarities to bacterial rhamnolipids. Acetyl-substituted disaccharide linked to the hydroxyl function of a hydroxycarboxylic acid is found in sophorose ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 137138 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
lipids of Torulopsis bombicola  (Inoue and Ito, 1982). Sophorolipid produc-
tion can be increased from 5 to 150 g/l in the presence of glucose and hexa-decane (Linton, 1990). Species of Candida  produce surfactants that are 
polysaccharide-lipid or lipopeptide in nature, produced either within the infrastructure of the cell wall or in the medium.
4.14.3 Metabolite Overproduction
Several yeasts and ﬁ  lamentous fungi produce a wide range of metabolities of 
industrial importance on hydrocarbons in the presence of optimum growth conditions. These products include organic acids, amino acids, antibiotics, sterols, and others. The use of products derived from hydrocarbons in the food industry must still obtain public approval.
Various strains of C. lipolytica  are established to produce organic acids. 
Citric acid production exceeding 200 g/l is achieved by C. lipolytica  grown on 
alkanes (Ikeno et al., 1975). Despite high production, the commercial produc-tion of citric acid employs Aspergillus niger  and carbohydrate substrates. 
Several yeasts excrete small amounts of dicarboxylic acids during growth on alkanes due to ω-oxidation involving diterminal oxidation. By selection tech-
niques and nonspeciﬁ  c mutagenesis, speciﬁ  c strains can result that show per-
turbance in β-oxidation. These strains accumulate dicarboxylic acids >100 g/l 
during growth on a mixture of alkane–acetate substrates. Even the isolation of mutants does not lead to complete removal of the activity of acyl-CoA oxidase. An industrial strain of C. tropicalis  has been engineered for the 
p r o d u c t i o n  o f  l o n g - c h a i n  d i c a r b o x y l i c  a c i d s  w i t h  a  h i g h  d e g r e e  o f  p u r i t y  (Picataggio et al., 1992), and the schematic process has been illustrated by Lindley (1994). This process has the potential to replace the industrial chemi-cal synthesis of long-chain dicarboxylic acids at an affordable price.
Peroxisomal enzymes can be employed in medical diagnosis tests (Tanaka 
et al., 1982). When cultivated at controlled phosphate concentrations and acidic pH, certain yeasts can accumulate various types of sugar alcohols. Peroxisomal enzymes can be overproduced. Fukui and Tanaka (1980) reported the production of both vitamin B
2 and B 6 and stimulation of cyto-
chrome c and coenzyme Q to a high level on alkane media by yeasts. Several yeasts exhibit improved production of ergosterol during growth on alkanes. Fusarium  s p .  p r o d u c e d  y i e l d s  o f  2 6 0  m g / l  o f  e r g o s t e r o l  a n d  4 6  0 0 0  m g / l  o f  
extracellular alkaline protease (Nakao et al., 1973). Paecilomyces carneus ,
an alkane-assimilating fungus, has been employed to produce cephalosporin, aβ-lactam family of antibiotics. Cephalosporin concentrations of 450 mg/l 
were obtained, but three forms of antibiotic were present in similar amounts (Kitano et al., 1976).
The future direction of long-term strategies of economic importance on 
alkane substrates is unclear. The potential of hydrocarbon-degrading yeasts and fungi has been largely ignored due to public unacceptance of the prod-ucts. Harnessing the full potential of advances in molecular technology will open the door for correct assessment of the economic importance of alkane-
degrading yeasts and ﬁ  lamentous fungi in the future.
4.15 BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING
Advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have played a certain role 
in the fungal degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Some of this knowledge is summarized in the foregoing paragraphs regarding cytochrome P450 e nzym e  s y s t e m s .  W an g  e t  al .  ( 1 999 b )  i d e n t iﬁ  ed 5 acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) 
oxidase isozymes, Aox1-Aox5 in Yarrowia lipolytica , encoded by the POX1 
to POX5 genes. The ACO3 gene, encoding one of the acyl-CoA oxidase iso-zymes, has been cloned and sequenced from Y. lipolytica  (Wang et al., 1998). 
This gene allows narrow substrate speciﬁ  city that is conﬁ  rmed by expression 
in Escherichia coli . A genomic DNA clone encoding carnitine acetyltransfer-
ases, localized in two subcellular organelles, peroxisomes and mitochondria of C. tropicalis , has been isolated (Kawachi et al., 1996). Nucleotide and 
amino acid sequences have been analyzed. Kamasawa et al. (1996) presented immunoelectron microscopic observations on the localization of thiolase enzymes in C. tropicalis . This visual analysis is useful for the elucidation of 
a process of peroxisome proliferation and enzyme transport in a cell. The physiological functions of three thiolase isozymes in C. tropicalis  have been 
evaluated by gene disruption (Kanayama et al., 1998). The role of peroxi-somal heme in transport mechanism in C. tropicalis  cells was examined by 
Soga et al. (1997). Yamamoto et al. (1995) described the puriﬁ  cation of novel 
peroxisomal NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase in n-alkane C. tropica-
lis–grown cells, which is effective in proliferation of peroxisomes. Such studies 
lead to an understanding of metabolic pathways related to mechanisms of degradation of hydrocarbons by fungi.
Different groups of microorganisms in the environment usually degrade 
petroleum hydrocarbons. The biodegradation is more rapid in temperate than in cold regions. Despite the retarding effect of low temperatures on biochemi-cal reactions, these microorganisms grow at a similar rate to those living in the temperate regions. These microorganisms have developed various adapta-tions of structural changes in membranes, proteins, and enzymes. Thus, the use of these psychrophilic enzymes offer considerable potential in bioreme-diation processes (Gerday et al., 2000). In temperate regions, seasonal varia-tions in temperature can reduce the effectiveness of microorganisms in degrading petroleum hydrocarbons. However, bioaugmentation and inocula-tion with speciﬁ  c cold-adapted microorganisms can improve the biodegrada-
tion of such oils. Due to the high catalytic efﬁ  ciency of enzymes and speciﬁ  city 
at low and moderate temperatures, these organisms have the potential for hydrocarbon bioremediation. Cold-adapted microorganisms, especially fungi, can open new horizons in the ﬁ  eld of petroleum biotechnology and 
bioremediation.BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING 139140 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS
4.16 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Hydrocarbon degradation is site-speciﬁ  c and limited by the metabolic capa-
bilities of hydrocarbon-degrading fungal populations and a wide range of environmental factors. The effectiveness of the process depends on identify-ing the rate-limiting factors and optimizing them in the feasibility studies. The various ecosystems, such as aquatic, freshwater, and terrestrial, present different challenges for fungal growth. Adapted fungal communities also play an important role in hydrocarbon degradation. Assessment methods can be employed to determine the existing conditions favorable for fungal growth, and respirometric tests can verify metabolically active fungal populations. Treatability studies performed with soils or slurries can be tested under several conditions, such as unmodiﬁ  ed microcosm, nutrient-amended, and 
biologically inhibiting conditions, in order to collect useful data on the rate and extent of degradation. Process engineering variables are also to be inte-grated from each scale of observation for predicting the treatment. This a ppr oach sugg ests tha t th e ﬁ  e l d da ta sh o ul d be com par ed syste ma ticall y to 
laboratory results to evaluate the success of the scale-up process.
Seeding the contaminated environments with exogenous fungi is unknown. 
The available knowledge on the value of seeding with exogenous microbes is not convincing enough to be considered a good approach for the bioremedia-tion of petroleum hydrocarbons. Moreover, exogenous microbes have to compete with indigenous microbes to prove their effectiveness. Nutrient addi-tions have been shown to overcome the critical rate-limiting factors. Addition of bulking agents (e.g., peat moss with bran ﬂ  akes) produces the best growth, 
penetration, and enzyme activity of strains of Bjerkandera adusta  in soil suit-
able for bioremediation (Meysami and Baheri, 2003). Genetically engineered fungal strains exhibiting improved capabilities for hydrocarbon metabolism can be seeded for the elimination of hydrocarbon pollutants. Mixed cultures of speciﬁ  c bacteria and fungi are also a potential target for seeding, due to 
different but complementary hydrocarbon-degrading capabilities. The seeding of mixed cultures has its own limitations and merits additional study.

FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF 
POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS AND DIOXINS
5.1 INTRODUCTION
Polychlorinated biphenyls are a family of compounds containing a biphenyl 
molecule tha t is chlorina ted to f orm a n um ber of possible cong eners. P oly -chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) differ in the number and distribution of chlo-rine (1 to 10) on the biphenyl nucleus. PCBs exhibit the chemical formula C
12H10−nCln. They are used extensively in a wide variety of commercial appli-
cations in industrial processes and products because of excellent chemical stability and electrical insulating properties. Their applications range from the manufacturing of adhesives, printing, surface coatings, textiles, plastics, lubricants, and cooling systems to dielectric ﬂ  uids (capacitors and transform-
ers), hydraulic ﬂ  uids, and ﬁ  re retardants. PCBs were synthesized from the 
1920s to 1978 in Japan, Europe, and the United States. Accidental spills, leaking of PCBs from electric transformers, and improper practices to dispose of industrial PCB wastes contributed contamination of various media, ranging from soils and sediments to rivers and streams.
PCBs are among the most widespread and recalcitrant contaminants and 
are present in abiotic and biotic environments throughout the world. These chemicals are known to persist for several decades, and this persistence can b e  a t t r i b u t e d  t o  t h e  i n a b i l i t y  o f  m i c r o o r g a n i s m s  t o  m e t a b o l i z e  t h e s e  c o m -pounds. Their toxicity and role in disrupting the endocrine system are well known. Kimbrough (1995) described the impact of PCBs on human health. Research in the past two decades has thoroughly documented the fate and

behavior of PCBs in global ecosystems. Due to their carcinogenic, mutagenic, 
teratogenic, and other toxic properties, PCBs have been phased out world-wide because of their applications during the 1970s.
In 1976, the U.S. Congress enacted the Toxics Substances Control Act 
(TSCA), regulating the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, and use of PCBs (40 CFR 761 et seq.). The PCB Spill Cleanup Policy, regu-lated by Subpart G of 40 CFR 761, happened after the effective date (May 4, 1987). PCBs are also regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), governed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleanup of widespread contamina-tion at current and former industrial sites continues to take place under the Superfund. Robinson and Lenn (1994) have described some aspects of envi-ronmental legislation related to contaminated land and water due to PCBs.
5.2 NOMENCLATURE
According to the IUPAC, PCBs consist of two rings, one ring labeled clock-
wise and the other anticlockwise, with the numbering of subsequent positions in the molecule. There are 209 possible congeners of PCBs based on differ-ences in the number and arrangement of chlorine substituents. The nomen-clature of the numbering system has been adopted for these chemicals. Approximately 150 congeners are known to exist in the environment (Yadav et al., 1995). Industrial mixtures such as the Aroclor series (United States), Kaneclors (Japan), Sovols (former USSR), Clophen (Germany), Phenoclor and Pyralene (France), and Fenchlor (Italy) are widely produced and used on the basis of restricted chlorination of biphenyl. Aqueous solubility and volatility decrease with additional substitution. The order of chlorination decreases as follows: Aroclor 1242 > 1248 > 1260. They also exhibit differ-
ences in physical appearance [e.g., clear liquids (Aroclor 1242–1248) to light-colored oils (Aroclor 1254–1262), to off-white powder (Aroclor 1268)].
5.3 BIOACCUMULATION AND TOXICITY
These compounds are difﬁ  cult to degrade, are not easily metabolized, and 
tend to bioaccumulate in fatty tissue occupying higher trophic levels. Several factors are responsible for PCB bioaccumulation (Hamdy and Gooch, 1986). These include the concentration in the environment, duration of exposure, contaminant solubility, species age, weight, feeding habits and lipid level, variations in trophic level, and adsorption. Moreover, studies on bioaccumula-tion and degradation by bacteria and uptake of PCBs by yeasts, fungi, phytoplanktons, and marine diatoms are summarized. The uptake and bio-concentration in aquatic invertebrates and studies on the metabolism of PCBs by birds and mammals are also reviewed.All Aroclors inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  when 
employed in fermentable media (Tejedor et al., 1979). Cole et al. (1979) calculated bioconcentration factors of 307 ± 63 for biphenyl and 1547 for 
4-chlorobiphenyl by Rhodotorula rubra . Certain diatoms are also found to 
concentrate PCBs (Keil et al., 1971; Biggs et al., 1980). Boyle et al. (1992) estimated the amount of PCBs in the environment of different media. The cleanup of hot spots of PCB contamination is an important issue. PCBs are known to bind covalently to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), both in vivo and in vitro. Huang and Gibson (1992) reported the relation of acute toxicity to coplaner conﬁ  guration of the chlorinated biphenyls. Various factors [e.g., the 
log P value of the congeners and the steric effect coefﬁ  cients (SECs)] con-
tribute to the process of bioaccumulation. Hydrophobicity is responsible for the accumulation and fate of PCBs in biological systems. The central issue is to discover the potential of microorganisms to detoxify these compounds.
5.4 ALTERNATIVE PCB REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES
Due to their ubiquitous nature, the development of PCB remediation tech-
nologies is in progress. Current knowledge of PCB remediation technologies is far from complete. The cleanup goal must be ﬁ  nalized by regulatory agen-
cies before the implementation of remediation technology. Moreover, the ability to attain the cleanup goal in a given contaminated site by technology is also considered. The main purpose of establishing a cleanup goal is to protect human health and the environment. Many hazardous waste treatment technologies are well recognized in treating such wastes. Alternative PCB remediation technologies in various media are listed in Table 5.1.
5.5 ANALYSIS OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS
During PCB biodegradation, chlorides are generally released in the system 
and are measured. Several methods are known for the detection of chlorides, ranging from simple colorimetric to complex chromatographic methods. Robinson and Lenn (1994) discussed several methods for the detection of chlorides, the degree of sensitivity, and the corresponding references. These methods include atomic adsorption, colorimetric, endpoint titration with silver ions, modiﬁ  ed Mohr’s titration, x-ray ﬂ  uorescence spectrophotometry, 
ion chromatography, and ion chromatography with an electric conductivity detector. These methods are also used to elucidate metabolic pathways when used in conjunction with GC or HPLC.
At present, gas chromatography (GC) is the most common method of PCB 
analysis. However, the detectors are used along with GC to enhance its resolu-tion. Flame ionization detectors (FIDs) and electron capture detectors ANALYSIS OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS 151152 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PCBs AND DIOXINS
(ECDs) are employed along with GC on a regular basis. High-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) has also been used along with ultraviolet (UV) detectors in the detection of PCBs. Mass spectrometer (MS) is also employed in conjunction with GC for individual PCB congeners that do not coelute. Erickson (1997) has described the analytical chemistry of PCBs.
The GC-ECD and capillary column are employed for the estimation of 
PCBs in soils by white-rot fungi, methylotrophic and hydrocarbon-utilizing yeasts, and bacteria (Sasek et al., 1993; Kubatova et al., 2001). The potential to transform di-, tetra-, and hexachlorinated PCBs using Phanerochaete
chrysosporium  has been studied by HPLC, GC-MS, and TLC and autoradi-
ography (Dietrich et al., 1995). Cloete and Celliers (1999) quantiﬁ  ed the 
remaining amount of Aroclor 1254 in the cultures by GC-ECD. Arochlor degradation is analyzed by GC-ECD in a fused silica capillary column at 70 eV in a full-scan mode. A GC-MS is also employed for the analysis of a wide range of degradation products of PCB 9 using the white-rot fungus TABLE 5.1 Polychlorinated Biphenyl Remediation Technologies

Bioavailability is used to interpret the behavior of chemical constituents in 
the presence of microorganisms and plants in soils, sediments, and water. Nine deﬁ  nitions of bioavailability and its signiﬁ  cance for understanding the 
fate of chemical constituents have been compiled (Madsen, 2003). Based on the persistence of PCBs in nature, seven hypothesized mechanisms were put forth in which bioavailability inﬂ  uences bioremediation. These include sorp-
tion, non-aqueous-phase liquid (NAPL) partitioning, micropores, nanopores, organic complexation, insolubility, and absorption into native organic matter. Bioavailability of persistent organic compounds in the environment has also been described (Alexander, 1997; Baveye and Bladon, 1999). Methods for measurement of the bioavailability of PCBs in soils or sediments are unknown at the present time. There is a three-way interaction between microorganisms, PCBs, and a geochemical matrix. Soil or sediment chemistry has a signiﬁ  cant 
impact on sorption and PCB bioavailability. Knowledge of how to estimate the rate of release of PCBs and its kinetics from soils and sediments is not available. Knowledge of the inﬂ  uence of various physicochemical parameters 
(diffusion coefﬁ  cients, hydrodynamics, sorption coefﬁ  cients, matrix struc-
ture) and processes (dissolution, desorption) on the persistence of these com-pounds can be gained to predict bioavailability in various physical states. A systematic protocol for determining the bioavailability and biokinetics of organic pollutants in soil slurry, compacted bioreactors, and intact soil systems (Tabak and Govind, 1997) and the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms of bioavailability (V oice et al., 1997) have been developed. Quantifying bio-availability is subject to mass transfer limitations (Bosma et al., 1997). Chemi-cal and biochemical reactions to depict certain interactions, processes, and mechanisms of action due to bioavailability have not been elucidated. Zeddel et al. (1993) reported a lower rate of PCB degradation due to lowered bio-availability. The important requirements include the homogenization process and proper contact of mycelia of fungi and soil aggregates. Conventional mixing cannot degrade the higher chlorinated PCBs.
The use of pollutant carriers  such as surfactant or organic cosolvents is 
useful for enhancing the solubility of PCBs. The surfactant can be toxic to microbial populations. The addition of surfactant to an aqueous system results in the formation of micelles when the aqueous surfactant concentration is above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the biodegradation is modeled via the Monod equation (Guha and Jaffe, 1996; Guha et al., 1998). Layton et al. (1998) studied an integrated bioremediation process linking surfactant washing of PCBs from soils, followed by bacterial aerobic degrada-BIOA V AILABILITY OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS 153154 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PCBs AND DIOXINS
tion. The residual PCBs are deposited on a solid carrier, resulting in 
90% removal of PCBs.
5.7 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF 
POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS
5.7.1 Filamentous Fungi
PCBs were ﬁ  rst identiﬁ  ed in 1966 (Jensen, 1966) as a new environmental 
contaminant of public and regulatory concern (Colvin and Nelson, 1990). Soon after this discovery, their persistence in different matrices has given birth to various methods of treatment. Recently, the popularity of conven-tional technologies of incineration and landfarming has declined due to their transfer of contamination from one medium to another (e.g., land to air and l a n d  t o  l a n d ) .  D u e  t o  t h e  c o s t  a n d  d e m e r i t s  o f  t e c h n o l o g i e s  l i s t e d  a b o v e ,  researchers began to screen different types of microorganisms (fungi, yeasts, bacteria, and algae) to explore new frontiers of PCB degradation. Degrada-tion of PCBs and formation of metabolic products by ﬁ  lamentous fungi is 
noted in Table 5.2.
Fungal species belonging to several genera have the ability to grow on 
biphenyl and produce 2- and 4-hydroxybiphenyls and 4,4 ′-dihydroxybiphenyl 
(Smith and Rosazza, 1974). Murado et al. (1976) noted interactions between PCBs and soil fungi. A concentration range 5 to 50 μg/ml of Aroclor 1254 in 
the culture medium decreased the dry weight of Aspergillus ﬂ  avus . The nega-
tive effect was highly pronounced in Aroclor 1232 and lowest in Aroclor 1260. PCB mixtures containing 32 to 60% chlorine by weight were not metabolized by A. ﬂ avus . Resting cells of Sabouraud-grown Aspergillus niger  degraded 
the lower chlorinated PCBs present in Clophen A 30 (a technical PCB prepa-ration averaging 42% chlorine by weight) using a replacement culture tech-nique (Dmochewitz and Ballschmiter, 1988) . Three isomers of hydroxylated 
trichlorobiphenyls in the ratio 15 : 3 : 1 and traces of dichloro- and trichloro-benzoic acids were detected. The principle of para -recalcitrance was estab-
lished. Cunninghamella elegans  grown on Sabouraud dextrose broth can 
hydroxylate biphenyl, giving rise to 2-, 3- and 4-hydroxybiphenyls and 4,4 ′-
dihydroxybiphenyl as the major metabolites (Dodge et al., 1979). A tentatively identiﬁ  ed compound such as 2,4 ′-dihydroxybiphenyl was also produced. This 
fungus also transformed 4-hydroxybiphenyl and 2-hydroxybiphenyl to 4,4 ′-
dihydroxybiphenyl and 2,5-dihydroxybiphenyl, respectively. A survey of 11 fungal species shows more or less similar hydroxylation of biphenyl by two species comparable to C.elegans . In addition, 44% of metabolites produced 
by C. elegans  are the water-soluble glucuronides and sulfate conjugates. Path-
ways proposed for the initial transformation of biphenyl by C. elegans  are also 
known.
Ten fungi produced 4-hydroxybiphenyl, and seven of the 10 released 
4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl on biphenyl in a study by Schwartz et al. (1980). TABLE 5.2 Fungal (Filamentous Fungi and Yeasts) Degradation of Polychlorinated Biphenyls

Absidia pseudocylindrospora  NRRL 2770 and Absidia  sp. NRRL 1341 were 
the best performers. Rhizopus japonicus  converted 4-chlorobiphenyl and 4,4 ′-
dichlorobiphenyls (DCB) to hydroxylated metabolites (Wallnofer et al., 1973). The mechanism of hydroxylation of biphenyl by Cunninghamella echinulata
was examined through two deuterated forms of substrates (Smith et al., 1981). The absence of isotope effect during the hydroxylation of biphenyl was noted. The presence of 1,2-hydride shift during 4-hydroxylation provided a link for the formation of an arene oxide as an intermediate. Aspergillus parasiticus
resulted in the formation of 3-aryl muconolactones during the metabolism of biphenyl (Mobley et al., 1993). These products were formed only from biphe-nyls para -substituted at both phenyl rings and were not detected with unsub-
stituted biphenyls or meta -terphenyl.
5.7.2 Yeasts
Degradation of PCBs by yeasts is noted in Table 5.2. The oxidation of biphe-
nyl occurs at the 4-position to form 4-hydroxybiphenyl by microsomal prepa-rations from Candida tropicalis  (Wiseman et al., 1975). Cerniglia et al. (1980) 
reported the oxidation of biphenyl to 4-hydroxyphenyl by Oscillatoria  sp. 
strain JCM. Oxidation at the 4-position by fungi, yeast, and a cyanobacterium suggests the similarity found in the mammalian metabolism of biphenyl and chlorinated biphenyls. Glucose- or phenol-grown cells of Trichosporon mucoi-
des were shown to have the ability to transform biphenyl into a large variety 
of mono-, di-, and trihydroxylated products, hydroxylated on one or both r i n g s  w i t h i n  4 8  h o u r s  ( S i e t m a n n  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 1 ) .  S o m e  o f  t h e  m e t a b o l i t e s  accumulated in the culture supernatant as dead-end products and ortho -
substituted dihydroxylated biphenyls were substrates for further oxidation and ring ﬁ  ssion. In general, the transformation pathway of biphenyl was not 
affected by the mode of growth. The only exception was 2,3-dihydroxybiphe-n y l ,  i n  w h i c h  t r a n s f o r m a t i o n  o c c u r r e d  o n l y  b y  p h e n o l - g r o w n  c e l l s .  P h e n y l  derivatives of hydroxymuconic acids and the corresponding pyrones formed due to ring ﬁ  ssion. Oxidation and ring ﬁ  ssion of 3,4-dihydroxybiphenyl 
resulted in the formation of seven novel metabolites. The pathway for the biotransformation of biphenyl by Trichosporon mucoides  is shown in Figure 
5.1. All ring ﬁ  ssion products are considerably less toxic than the hydroxylated 
derivatives.
Cells of Debaryomyces vanrijiae  SBUG 770 grown with glucose were 
shown to have the ability to oxidize biphenyl to 4-hydroxybiphenyl as the main metabolite and 2-hydroxybiphenyl in minor amounts within 70 hours (Lange et al., 1998). When grown with tetradecane, cells of the yeast strain exhibited a lower ability to degrade biphenyl with the accumula-tion of small amounts of the hydroxylated metabolites. Under these conditions, 2-hydroxybiphenyl was slowly oxidized to 2,5-dihydroxybiphenyl, and 4-hydroxybiphenyl was rapidly metabolized, producing small amounts of two metabolites. One was identiﬁ  ed as 3,4-dihydroxybiphenyl and biphenyl

second as 4-phenylmuconolactone. This lactone is also formed from 3,
4-dihydroxybiphenyl as a substrate. However, the oxidation of 4-hydroxybi-phenyl produced the ring ﬁ  ssion metabolite 4-phenyl-2-pyrone-6-carboxylic 
acid via 3,4-dihydroxybiphenyl. It appeared that ring cleavage of the aromatic structure took place after introduction of a third —OH group into the dihy-droxylated intermediate.
Such a ring cleavage is also known during the transformation of diphenyl 
ether by Trichosporon beigelii  SBUG 752 (Schauer et al., 1995). In addition, 
several oxidation products are formed during transformation. A monooxy-genation step producing 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxydiphenyl ethers (47 : 5 : 48) initi-ates this, and further oxidation results in 3,4-dihydroxydiphenyl ether. Further oxidation of 3- and 4-hydroxydiphenyl ethers produces 3,4-dihydroxydiphenyl ether and 6-carboxy-4-phenoxy-2-pyrone.158 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PCBs AND DIOXINS
5.7.3 White-Rot Fungi
White-rot fungi have shown their ability to degrade many complex mixtures 
of PCBs and single congeners. Degradation of these xenobiotics is mediated by a lignin-degrading enzyme system of the fungus secreted in the extracel-lular environment. Major components of the lignin-degrading enzyme system include lignin peroxidases (LiPs), Mn(II)-dependent peroxidases (MnPs), and H
2O2-producing system. These are induced during secondary metabolism 
under nutrient-limiting culture conditions. Many white-rot fungi have the ability to degrade a wide variety of PCBs. Besides Phanerochaete chrysospo-
rium , several other white-rot fungi [e.g., Pleurotus ostreatus  (Beaudette et al., 
1998; Kubatova et al., 2001), Coriolopsis polysona  (Vyas et al., 1994; Novotny 
et al., 1997), Coriolus  (Trametes )versicolor  (Beaudette et al., 1998; Cloete 
and Celliers, 1999; Koller et al., 2000). Bjerkandera adusta  (Beaudette et al., 
1998), Lentinus  (Lentinula )edodes  (Sasek et al., 1993; Ruiz-Aguilar et al., 
2002)] are also known to metabolize PCBs.
5.7.3.1 White-Rot Fungal Bioreactors.  White-rot fungi (e.g., Pleurotus
ostreatus  and Trametes versicolor ) in a solid-state system (Zeddel et al., 1993) 
have been shown able to degrade PCBs. Three types of experiments were performed: (1) batch cultures were conducted with PCB-soaked wood chips for the degradation of PCBs; (2) closed 700-ml glass tubes 7 cm in diameter were used with air ventilation from the bottom to the top, and porous clay was ﬁ  lled at the bottom of the bioreactor to obtain a water sink to optimize 
the water tension in the hole of the tube; and (3) glass tubes were prepared in the same way as in type 2. After loading contaminants on the soil, a homog-enization procedure was employed before mixing wood chips and fungal mycelia. Dried wood chips were added to the soil mud until it solidiﬁ  ed into 
soil aggregates and was inoculated with Pleurotus ostreatus  (3% w/w).
Phanerochaete chrysosporium ,Trametes versicolor , and Coriolopsis
polysona  have been grown in malt extract medium with glucose and thus 
homogenized for the preparation of inoculum (Vyas et al., 1994). Fungi w e r e  g r o w n  i n  t h e  p r e s e n c e  o f  a i r  b e f o r e  b e i n g  s p i k e d  w i t h  [

tetrachlorobiphenyl. Oxygen was ﬂ  ushed immediately after spiking and then 
after 1 week. The 14CO 2 in headspace air was bubbled in 2 M ethanolamine 
as a 14CO 2 trap, and the radioactivity was measured. Speciﬁ  cally designed 
tube reactors were employed for the biodegradation of contaminated soil by Pleurotus ostreatus  (Kubatova et al., 2001). The tube (3.5 cm in diameter and 
24 cm in length) was divided into two compartments by a ﬁ  ne nylon net. In 
one compartment, the fungus was inoculated to the straw and mycelium grew through the net to the other compartment, which contained sterilized soil contaminated with a commercial mixture of Delor 103. The system was aerated and moistened during the course of a 2-month period. The reader is referred to Novotny et al. (1999) for a detailed description of this experimen-tal procedure.5.7.3.2 Degradation and Mineralization.  Table 5.3 notes the degradation 
and mineralization of PCBs by white-rot fungi. Biphenyl and two model chlorinated biphenyls (i.e., 2-chlorobiphenyl and 2,2 ′,4,4′-tetrachlorobipheny l) 
were degraded in suspended cultures by Phanerochaete chrysosporium
(Thomas et al., 1992). Extensive mineralization of radiolabeled biphenyl (22.5%) and 2-chlorobiphenyl (15.6%) to CO

T h i s  s u g g e s t s  i n i t i a l  o x i d a t i o n  o f  P C B s  b y  a n  u n k n o w n  enzymatic system. Kurek and Odier (1990) reported the presence of LiP isozymes bound to mycelia. This may also be due to the cell wall–bound form of unreleased LiP in the culture. The higher chlorinated PCB, 2,2 ′,4,4′-
tetrachlorobiphenyl, is degraded to CO
2 less readily and becomes associated 
with the mycelial biomass. P. chrysosporium  degraded 75% of the congeners 
in Aroclor 1242 at a low initial concentration of 0.90 mg/l after 3 weeks (Asther et al., 1987).
Most of the congeners in Aroclor 1242 and 1254 are degraded extensively 
in both nutrient-limited (ligninolytic) and nutrient-rich (nonligninolytic) media by P. chrysosporium  ( Y a d a v  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 5 ) .  E x t e n s i v e  d e g r a d a t i o n  
occurred in congeners with a varying number of ortho- ,para -, and meta -
chlorines, suggesting relative nonspeciﬁ  cally for the position of chlorine sub-
stitutions on the biphenyl ring. This behavior is due to a free radical attack mechanism and is also known in the degradation of a wide variety of other aromatic compounds, such as chlorophenols and dioxins (Hammel, 1992). Malt extract medium supports maximum degradation (18.4% on a molar basis) of Aroclor 1260 as well as degradation of most of the congeners. The reductive dechlorination of certain components of Aroclor 1260 is known, but without noticeable reduction on a molar quantity (Quensen et al., 1990; GE, 1993). This was the ﬁ  rst conclusive report on the degradation of PCBs 
in Aroclor 1260 by any microorganism.
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  has the ability to transform three model 
PCBs, 4,4 ′-dichlorobiphenyl, 3,3 ′,4,4′-tetrachlorobiphenyl, and 2,2 ′,4,4′,5,5′-
hexachlorobiphenyl, in liquid culture (Dietrich et al., 1995). This study con-tradicted the para -recalcitrance, as the mineralization of 2-chlorobiphenyl 
was more or less equivalent to that reported by Thomas et al. (1992). The 
14C
partitioning dynamics to dichlorinated biphenyls exhibited the nonspeciﬁ  c 
adsorption of PCBs to the fungal hyphae. P. chrysosporium  revealed higher 
mineralization rates of PCBs in cultures spiked with 30.14 nM (8.8 μg) 3,3 ′,4,4′-
tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) than at 513.7 nM (150 μg) (Vyas et al., 1994). C.
polysona  mineralized PCB 77 poorly at higher concentrations but displayed 
similarity in the 14C-radioactivity distribution pattern. Signiﬁ  cant improve-
ment in mineralization occurred in cultures spiked with lower concentrations. This correlates with the size of the intracellular pool of water-soluble radiola-bel, which is lower at higher concentrations than at lower concentrations. P.
chrysosporium  increases intracellular degradation of PCB at low concentra-
tion and contributes signiﬁ  cantly to the overall mineralization.FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS 159TABLE 5.3 Degradation and Mineralization of Polychlorinated Biphenyls by White-Rot Fungi

161162 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PCBs AND DIOXINS
Delor 103 or Delor 105 (as equivalents of Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1254) 
are not degraded under nitrogen-limited conditions but are reduced in non-limited nitrogen conditions by P. chrysosporium  (Krcmar and Ulrich, 1998). 
LiP or MnP activity was not detected under nonlimited nitrogen conditions. Degradation of di- tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and hepta-congeners exhibited no signiﬁ  c a n t  d i f f e r e n c e s .  B o t h  h i g h  a n d  s t a b l e  a c t i v i t i e s  o f  L i P ,  M n P ,  
Mn-independent peroxidase (MIP), and laccase are responsible for efﬁ  cient 
degradation of PCBs by white-rot fungi (Novotny et al., 1997). Trametes
multicolor  reduced an overall 80% of the initial concentration of 2,5-
dichlorobiphenyl (PCB 9) after 4 weeks (Koller et al., 2000). This is due to adsorption of PCB 9, and about 20% of PCB 9 can be extracted from the mycelium. This demonstrates the occurrence of degradation and adsorption/desorption simultaneously. Adsorption takes place due to reduction in the process of degradation. Nearly 40 components of the 41 major peaks of PCB 48 (includes di- to hexachlorobiphenyls) were degraded within 60 days by the edible mushroom Maitake, Grifola frondosa  M51 (Seto et al., 1999).
White-rot fungi also have the ability to degrade PCBs extracted from his-
torically contaminated soil (Ruiz-Aguilar et al., 2002). Tween 80 could emul-sify the PCB extract and had no effect on fungal growth. Triton X-100 and Tergitol NP-10 inhibited fungal growth by 75 to 95%. P. chrysosporium  was 
most effective for PCB degradation at an initial concentration of 3000 mg/l and removed up to 34% of the PCB mixture. P. chrysosporium  and L. edodes
accumulated low chlorinated congeners, and T. versicolor  transformed both 
low and high chlorinated congeners of PCBs. This is the ﬁ  rst report of PCB 
degradation at high concentration in a liquid culture by white-rot fungi.
Bjerkandera adusta  UAMH 7308 and B. adusta  UAMH 8258 were shown 
to be the most active degraders of PCB congeners (Beaudette et al., 1998). This is the ﬁ  rst report of degradation of PCB congeners by species of 
Bjerkandera .Trametes versicolor  degraded 2,3-dichlorobiphenyl extensively 
(96%), but was less effective with other congeners. The congener loss ranged from 40 to 96%, except P. chrysosporium . White-rot fungi showed mineral-
ization of 2,4 ′,5-[U-
14C]trichlorobiphenyl to 14CO 2. Low levels of LiP and 
MnP activities were detected in these fungi. However, regression analysis of biodegradation, mineralization, and LiP and MnP activities of all 14 strains revealed no linear correlation. Recently, Beaudette et al. (2000) demon-strated enhanced mineralization of a PCB congener by the application of a low concentration of surfactant. However, the surfactant did not increase the overall metabolism.
5.7.3.3 Effects of Chlorination Grades and Patterns.  In general, most of 
the studies presented so far conﬁ  rm the decrease in level of mineralization 
with an increase in the degree of PCB chlorination (Zeddel et al., 1993; Yadav et al., 1995; Beaudette et al., 1998; Kubatova et al., 2001). Thomas et al. (1992) determined the decrease in levels of mineralization in the following order: [
14C]biphenyl (23%) > 2-[14C]chlorobiphenyl (16%) > 2,2 ′,4,4′-[14C]tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) (10%). The data also show the effect of the 
congener chlorination pattern to PCB degradation by P. chrysosporium .
About 10% of 2,2 ′,4,4′-[14C]TCB in 32 days and <1% of 3,3 ′,4,4′-[14C]TCB 
were mineralized in 30 days (Bumpus et al., 1985; Thomas et al., 1992). The PCB chlorination pattern also affected the degradation of technical PCB mixtures by P. chrysosporium . Mineralization of 20% of [
14C]Aroclor 1242 
(42% chlorine by weight) (Bumpus et al., 1985) and 10 to 14% of [14C]Aroclor 
1254 (54% chlorine by weight) (Bumpus et al., 1985; Eaton, 1985) by P.
chrysosporium  has been determined. Zeddel et al. (1993) reported the deg-
radation of nonspeciﬁ  c PCB mixture by P. chrysosporium  to mono- and 
dichlorinated congeners.
5.7.3.4 Metabolic Products and Pathways.  Metabolic products produced 
during PCB degradation by white-rot fungi are listed in Table 5.4. Dietrich e t  a l .  ( 1 9 9 5 )  p r o d u c e d  t h e  ﬁ  rst conclusive report describing the metabolic 
products during PCB degradation by P. chrysosporium . These and prior 
studies suggest the characteristic chlorobenzoates as metabolic intermediates in PCB degradation pathways in fungi. Chlorobenzoates appear to be common metabolic products in bacterial and fungal PCB degradation path-ways, but the mechanism of their formation may or may not be the same. Dioxygenases are responsible for the meta- pathway, catalyzing the 2,3-
dihydroxylation and extradiol ring ﬁ  ssion. Three possibilities have been pro-
posed for the relation of 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol (4-CBAlc) to 4-chlorobenzoic acid (4-CBA) in the fungal PCB degradation pathway: (1) transformation of a PCB ﬁ  ssion-ring product to 4-CBA and then reduction to 4-CBAlc, (2) 
formation of 4-CBAlc and subsequent oxidation to 4-CBA, and (3) inde-pendent production of both 4-CBA and 4-CBAlc by parallel metabolic path-ways. In P. chrysosporium , two mechanisms appear to be responsible for 
the metabolism of a wide variety of diphenyl compounds (Hiratsuka et al., 2005): the LiP-catalyzed one-electron oxidation of the aromatic ring produc-ing the aryl cation radical, and the hydroxylation reactions of the aromatic ring by cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Glucose-grown cells of Pycnosporus cinnabarinus  have the ability to 
hydroxylate biphenyl and diphenyl ether in a Sabouraud medium culture (Jonas et al., 2000). Only low levels of hydroxylated metabolites equivalent to 1% of the parent compound were produced after 3 days. Laccase is the only ligninolytic enzyme found in the culture supernatant. All three strains of Trametes versicolor  produce the same pattern of metabolites on diphenyl 
ether and its halogenated derivatives, 4-bromo- and 4-chlorodiphenyl ethers (Hundt et al., 1999). No metabolites are produced by cells of T. versicolor
from diphenyl ethers during incubation with 1-aminobenzotriazole, a cyto-chrome P450 inhibitor. Cell-free supernatants of whole cultures showing MnP and laccase activities are unable to transform any of the diphenyl ethers. The pathway proposed for the degradation of diphenyl ethers by T. versicolor  is 
shown in Figure 5.2.FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS 163TABLE 5.4 Metabolic Products During Degradation of Polychlorinated Biphenyls by White-Rot Fungi

Trametes multicolor  produces a wide variety of metabolic products due to 
degradation of 2,5-dichlorobiphenyl (PCB 9) (Koller et al., 2000). The com-pounds identiﬁ  ed  v ary  fr o m  o xi dized  p r od u cts  s u c h  as  c hl o rin a t ed  p h e n o ls  
and carboxylated benzenes to reduced metabolites as chlorinated benzenes. The formation of several metabolites suggests complex reaction pathways. In vitro experiments show the mineralization of 4,4 ′-dichlorobiphenyl using P.
chrysosporium  with the formation of 4-chlorobenzoate and 4-chlorobenzyl 
alcohol as its metabolites (Hickey, 1996). Grifola frondosa  M51 accumulates 
dichloromethoxyphenol during degradation of PCB 48 in low-nitrogen medium (Seto et al., 1999). This metabolite appears to be produced as a result of a ring cleavage of PCB degradation. The fungus accumulates three metabo-lites during degradation of 4-chlorobiphenyl and seem to be the isomers of hydroxy-4-chlorobiphenyl.O

Science and Business Media and the authors.]5.7.3.5 Role of Manganese in PCB Degradation.  Addition of Mn(IV) 
oxide in cultures was shown to improve the production, enzymatic activity, and stability of LiP of P. chrysosporium  (Kern, 1989). The chelating agents 
stimulated MnP in the presence of Mn(II). Addition of solid manganese (IV) oxide improved the production of MnP and H
2O2 and enhanced 
the rate of degradation of Aroclor 1254 in an N-limited medium by Coriolus versicolor  (Cloete and Celliers, 1999). H
2O2 production was 
enhanced by a 34.5 mM concentration of MnO 2. Aroclor 1242 was also 
removed in the absence of MnO 2, suggesting the presence of LiP or nonspe-
ciﬁ c absorption. About 84% of Aroclor was eliminated in cultures containing 
57.5 mM MnO 2 in 6 days. Penta- and hexachlorobiphenyls were removed at 
a slower rate than tri- and tetrachlorobiphenyl in cultures with MnP or LiP.
5.7.3.6 PCB Bioremediation in Soils.  Colvin and Nelson (1990) presented 
a ﬁ eld demonstration and described the advantages of a process using P.
chrysosporium . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued 
the ﬁ  rst research and development permit for the bioremediation of PCBs 
using white-rot fungi. Degradation of Aroclors occurs and the less chlori-nated congeners decrease on a percentage basis. However, growth does not occur at temperatures below 15°C. Table 5.5 lists the bioremediation of PCBs in soils by white-rot fungi.
Similar rates of degradation for mono-, di-, and trichlorinated PCBs 
in different media revealed certain similarities in the activities of fungi (Zeddel et al., 1993). Based on the substitution pattern, up to 50% of penta- and hexachlorobiphenyls was degraded. The lower chlorinated 4,4 ′-
dichlorobiphenyl was not degraded. The enzymatic system preferred the sub-stituted para -position. Low reactivity of ortho -position may result in slower 
degradation of para -isomers. Slow degradation of PCBs occurs when adsorbed 
on a soil surface. Growth and degradation of PCBs are not achieved by the addition of lignosulfonate, an inducer of ligninolytic activity. Bedard (1990) demonstrated about 50% degradation in the upper few centimeters of PCB-contaminated soil and 10% in the deeper layers due to the use of bacterial cultures.
A model system has been established at the laboratory scale for the trans-
formation of PCB-contaminated soil through bioaugmentation using P. chrysosporium  grown on sugarcane bagasse pith (Fernandez-Sanchez 
et al., 1999). Nearly 90% degradation occurred with a young inoculum of mycelia. This treatment appears to be suitable in a remediation process, due to the shorter time necessary to produce inoculum along with the high level of degradation. In general, the most chlorinated congeners dehalogenate to the least chlorinated congeners. The main transformation occurs in pentachlorobiphenyls. Viney and Bewley (1990) showed a 50% reduction in the pentachlorinated biphenyl and a 53% reduction in the hexachlorinated biphenyl in P. chrysosporium –inoculated sand cultures.

106, respectively, after 6 weeks in pasteurized soil (Sasek et al., 1993). However, 50% Delor degraded in nonpasteurized soil by a mixture of white-rot fungi, yeasts, and bacteria after 11 weeks. P. chrysosporium  and 
four other white-rot fungi produced extensive mycelial networks when inocu-lated into soil contaminated with a highly chlorinated mixture of PCBs (Hickey, 1996). However, only about a ≤6% reduction in certain congeners 
was found after 40 days. The white-rot fungi are the most effective to degrade the more lightly chlorinated PCBs, thus exhibiting similarities to aerobic bacteria.
5.7.3.7 Biotransformation of PCBs by Laccases.  Laccases are versatile 
enzymes and occur widely in fungi. Their role in fungi is varied and involved in the regulation of morphology, the control of virulence and nutrition, and to delignify woody tissues. These are also useful for the degradation of a variety of persistent organic pollutants. Despite extensive studies, knowledge of the dehalogenation of PCBs by fungal laccases is fragmentary . T able 5.6 contains some studies on the degradation of PCBs by white-rot fungal laccases.
Chlorinated hydroxybiphenyls are transformed to oligomerization prod-
ucts by laccase from Pycnosporus cinnabarinus  (Schultz et al., 2001). Trans-
formation of 2-hydroxy-5-chlorobiphenyl by laccase results in one main product in the form of dimer, 5,5 ′-di-(2-hydroxybiphenyl). One coupling of 
2-h y dr o xy - 5-chl o r o b i p h e n y l  occurs  a t  posi ti o n  C5  in  th e  para -position with 
respect to the —OH group, and thus both chlorine atoms are split off. Further products represent C—O and C—C linked dimers with no dechlorination. Transformation of 3-chloro-4-hydroxybiphenyl produces white precipitates and the formation C—O and C—C linked dimers with a different number of chlorines.
Transformation of 4-hydroxy-4 ′-chlorobiphenyl produced slightly violet 
precipitates and the formation C—C dimers and one or two chlorine atoms. Addition of 2-hydroxydiphenyl ether and 2-hydroxybiphenyl to cell-free supernatants containing laccase of P. cinnabarinus  resulted in the formation 
of different-colored precipitates (Jonas et al., 2000). Transformation of 2-hydroxydiphenyl ether formed a red-brown precipitate, and that of 2-hydroxybiphenyl a red precipitate. Only 3% of the compounds added initially were detectable after 30 minutes of incubation with the culture ﬁ  ltrate. GC-
MS analysis of the polymer mixture revealed pools of dimers and trimers with different binding types. Dimers with C—C bonds in the para -position 
to the hydroxyl group of the monomers have been identiﬁ  ed as the major 
products.FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS 169TABLE 5.6 Biotransformation of Polychlorinated Biphenyls by White-Rot Fungal Laccases

white-rot fungi became a model of research related to the degradation of various organic pollutants throughout the world. The knowledge produced as a result makes them unique and innovative organisms compared to bacteria that enjoyed well-established methods of bioremediation. The major differ-ences include the possession of unusual and remarkable mechanisms that have great advantages over the bacterial systems. Understanding of the com-plexity of mechanisms will lead to the development of emerging applications in this method of bioremediation.
In bacterial systems, bacteria must be exposed to the compound, and the 
organic compounds should be available in adequate quantities so that sufﬁ  -
cient synthesis of enzymes will take place for its degradation. On the con-trary, white-rot fungi can be cultivated under nutrient-limited conditions, and the process of degradation is initiated. Such limiting conditions result in the induction of various degradative enzymes. The major advantage lies in the fact that the production of a lignin-degrading system does not depend on the compound. In addition, preconditioning to a speciﬁ  c compound is not 
required.
White-rot fungi have been shown to cultivate easily on cheap and waste 
nutrient sources such as wood chips, sawdust, and agricultural wastes, and to become established strongly in the ﬁ  eld among the indigenous microorgan-
isms. Bacteria do not utilize such nutrient sources as easily. The limited knowledge indicates the growth of white-rot fungi in different geographical areas, utilizing these sources of nutrients. These fungi have a strong ability to antagonize microbial growth during ﬁ  eld trials. These fungi are known to 
produce hydroxyl free radicals that can result in the death of other microor-ganisms by oxidizing proteins and DNA. In addition, the fungus has the ability to adjust the pH of the surrounding environment, thus unbalancing the optimum pH of other microbes.
Another major difference of degradation lies in the order of kinetics. 
In bacterial systems, the metabolism is accompanied by enzymatic conver-sions and governed by kinetics of Michaelis–Menten order. Also, bacterial degradation depends on the solubility of compound or mixture of com-pounds. On the contrary, a free radical process and degradation of com-pounds by these fungi display pseudo-ﬁ  rst-order kinetics. Several studies 
establish that the rate of disappearance or mineralization of compounds depends on its initial concentration. This reﬂ  ects the capability of these fungi 
to achieve decontamination at the sites. Also, these fungi have the ability to convert insoluble organic complex mixtures by using a nonspeciﬁ  c free 
radical mechanism.
One of the most important advantages of white-rot fungi is the extracel-
lular degradation of organic compounds. In other words, degradation of organic compounds does not require metabolism. The nonspeciﬁ  c nature of 
the mechanism of white-rot fungi can be a successful remedy for PCB contamination.FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS 171172 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PCBs AND DIOXINS
5.8 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF DIOXINS
Dioxins and furans are some of the most toxic compounds known to science. 
Dioxins are released in the environment as the by-products of several indus-trial processes involving chlorine, such as waste incineration, chemical and pesticide manufacturing, and paper and pulp bleaching. These compounds are also found as impurities in pentachlorophenol, which is used as a wood preservative. These compounds are highly stable and lipophilic in nature.
Fungi are the most effective degraders of dioxins, and core studies have 
been performed by some researchers. Several strains of ﬁ  lamentous fungi 
have the ability to hydroxylate dibenzofuran, indicating a monooxygenase system (Hammer and Schauer, 1997). Eight strains of fungi metabolized dibenzofuran only to intermediates with hydrophilic characteristics. Six major metabolites were detected during the transformation of dibenzofuran by glucose-pregrown cells of Trichosporon mucoides  (Hammer et al., 1998). 
Incubation with monohydroxylated dibenzofurans produces 2,3-dihydroxydibenzofuran and its ring cleavage product 2-(1-carboxy methylidene)-2,3-dihydrobenzo[ b]furanylidene glycolic acid. Biotransforma-
tion of dibenzofuran and related derivatives by the Imperfect soil fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus  proceeded with phase I and phase II reactions to 
produce 14 hydroxylated and excretable sugar conjugative metabolites (Gesell et al., 2004). Biotransformation was catalyzed by two separate hydroxylation steps, and 4-mono- and 4-dihydroxylated dibenzofurans accumulated. Both aromatic rings were hydroxylated to form 2,7-, 3,7-, and 2,8-dihydroxydiben-zofurans, and further oxidation resulted in ring cleavage of dibenzofuran. The ring-ﬁ  ssion products include benzo[ b]furo[3,2- d]-2-pyrone-6-carboxylic acid 
and [2-(1-carboxy-methylidene)benzofuran-3-ylidene]hydroxyacetic acid, and its derivatives are hydroxylated at C7 and C8 at the noncleaved ring. Riboside conjugates of 2- and 3-hydroxydibenzofurans are among other metabolites.
A cyclic ether degrading fungus, Cordyceps sinensis  strain A, shows a new 
degradation pathway for dioxins (Nakamiya et al., 2005). Degradation of dibenzo- p-dioxin (DD) produces catechol, which is subsequently metabolized 
tocis,cis-muconates. Catechol, mono- and dichloro-catechol, and cis,cis-
muconates are formed as a result of the metabolism of 2,3,7-trichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7-triCDD). Degradation of octachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin 
(octaCDD) yields to catechol, mono- and trichloro-catechol, and cis,cis-
muconates. Dechlorination appears to occur in the degradation of octaCDD to catechols and in the subsequent degradation of catechols and/or cis,cis-muconates.
A white-rot fungus, Phlebia lindtneri , has been shown to biotransform 
model polychlorinated dibenzo- p- d i o x i n s  ( P C D D s ) ,  s u c h  a s  2 , 7 - d i c h l o r o - ,  
2,3,7-trichloro-, and 1,2,6,7- and 1,2,8,9-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxins to 
hydroxylated and methoxylated compounds (Kamei and Kondo, 2005). The degradation rate of 1,2,6,7-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin is higher than that of 2,3,7-trichlorodibenzo- p-dioxin. The degradation of the PCDDs is related to 
the chlorination patterns of these substrates. P. lindtneri  also metabolized 
2,8-dichlorodibenzofuran (2,8-diCDF) to hydroxy-diCDF (Mori and Kondo, 2002). The recombinant yeast cells expressing rat CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 each convert most of 2,3,7-trichlorodibenzo- p-dioxin to 8-hydroxy-2,3,7-
trichlorodibenzo- p-dioxin and subsequently to more hydrophilic compounds 
with cleavage of ethereal bridges (Sakaki et al., 2002). The metabolism showed three types of hydroxylations and opening of the dioxin ring. These ﬁ ndings suggest the possibility of use of yeast-expressing mammalian 
cytochrome P450 in the bioremediation of dioxin-contaminated soils. Three transformants of Coriolus hirsutus  efﬁ ciently converted 2,7/2,8-dichlo-
rodibenzo- p-dioxins (2,7/2,8-DCDDs) through the rat cytochrome P450, 
CYP1A1 enzyme (Orihara et al., 2005).

tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (tetraCDD) (Takada et al., 1996). Valli et al. 
(1992) suggested a multistep pathway for the degradation of 2,7-dichlorod-ibenzo- p-dioxin (2,7-diCDD) by LiP and MnP of Phanerochaete chrysospo-
rium . In the ﬁ  rst step, LiP oxidatively cleaves 2,7-diCDD to 
4-chloro-1,2-benzoquinone, 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone, and chloride. Reduction of 4-chloro-1,2-benzoquinone yields to 1-chloro-3,4-dihydroxy-benzene, which methylates to 1-chloro-3,4-dimethoxybenzene, and this sub-sequently oxidizes to 2-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone and chloride. LiP reduces the metabolite 2-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone to 2-methoxy-1,4-dihydroxyben-zene, which is further oxidized to 4-hydroxy-1,2-benzoquinone, and this is subsequently reduced to yield 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene. Reduction and ring cleavage of 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene yield β-ketoadipic acid.
5.9 GENETIC MANIPULATION
Recent advances in biotechnology can open the door for the development of 
genes responsible for the mineralization of PCBs by fungi. Genes encoding LiP in 30 fungal species have been screened (Varela et al., 2000) that may open new frontiers for the degradation of PCBs. A dendogram illustrating a sequence relationship among 32 fungal peroxidases has been presented (Martinez, 2002). A great future lies in successful genetic splicing and bring-ing together pathway fragments with a view to constructing an entirely new white-rot fungus that can utilize PCBs as the sole source of carbon.
5.10 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Virtually, no work is known on the screening of fungal species for the degra-
dation of PCBs. At present, there are not many PCB-degrading yeasts and fungi, so screening is important for the discovery of new fungal species. Most CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 173174 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PCBs AND DIOXINS
studies conducted to date have used liquid culture media and controlled con-
ditions in the laboratory. Some examples are known of the mineralization of PCBs, but the metabolic products have been identiﬁ  ed in only a few cases. 
Despite 95% degradation of chlorinated biphenyls by Trametes versicolor
(Zeddel et al., 1993), the mineralization rate obtained by white-rot fungi does not exceed 11% (Vyas et al., 1994; Dietrich et al., 1995; Beaudette et al., 1998). It seems that the metabolites formed due to degradation are difﬁ  cult 
to analyze. U nf ortuna te ly , no t m uch has been accomplished to da te on the elucidation of metabolic pathways of any PCB by fungi. It is recommended that experiments be designed such that the maximum mineralization of PCBs can be deciphered by fungi. Inoculating contaminated soils with effective PCB degraders along with optimizing requirements can provide efﬁ  cient 
mineralization. A combination of surfactant and yeasts or fungi, or yeast or fungi secreting surfactant, can also be tested to overcome the problems of bioavailability and degradation of PCBs.
In recent years, mechanisms of action of white-rot fungi related to organic 
pollutants have been understood that offer great potential for the use of PCB degradation. The contribution of the highly oxidation potential of a non-speciﬁ  c ligninolytic enzymatic system can be extended in the removal of 
complex mixtures of PCBs. The breakdown of readily available and readily utilizable materials such as wood chips is more economical than the come-tabolism of PCBs by aerobic bacteria. White-rot fungi can easily compete with other microbes and be established in the surrounding environment. The process controls need to be optimized to take full advantage of the unique system. The projections indicate a more cost-effective type of bioremediation system than the current competitive technologies. The time is ripe to imple-m e n t  l a b o r a t o ry  kn o w l e d g e  t o  d e s i gn  an  a p p li ca b l e  s tr a t e gy  f o r  l ar g e-s cal e  commercially viable white-rot bioremediation technology.

FUNGAL DEGRADATION 
OF PESTICIDES
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Synthetic pesticides have been known since 1939, when the insecticidal prop-
erties of DDT were discovered (Tessier, 1982). Pesticides are used extensively related to agriculture, animals, and humans to protect the public health. Soon after the discovery of various severe deleterious effects on animals and humans, several pesticides were banned for manufacture and use. The exten-sive use of pesticides has contributed to the contamination of many terrestrial and aquatic global ecosystems. Due to the extreme toxicity and persistence in the environment, they have been the target of research throughout the world for the past four decades.
Groundwater pollution is common in regions of the United States due to 
the impact of agricultural practices. As a result of such practices, considerable quantities of pesticide residues can be found in the soil and have the potential of leaching to the underlying groundwater. Leaching depends on the sorption and microbial degradation of pesticides in the soil. The chemical character-is ti cs  o f  th e  p e s ti ci d e s  als o  inﬂ  uence the sorption. In brief, soil properties, 
especially the organic fraction, affects the sorption and eventually, the poten-tial for leaching. Current knowledge of the microbial metabolism of pesticides in the soil is limited. In addition, degradation appears to be the only detoxi-ﬁ cation process of pesticides in the environment. Several review articles on 
the fate of microbial degradation of pesticides in the environment were 
Mycoremediation: Fungal Bioremediation , By Harbhajan Singh
Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.182 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PESTICIDES
published between 1970s and 1990s. The degradation of pesticides by fungi 
has also been discussed (Singh et al., 1991; Maloney, 2001).
Little is understood on the role of yeasts and fungi in the detoxiﬁ  cation of 
pesticides as compared to bacteria. Soil type, pH, organic matter, fungal biomass, moisture, aeration, and so on, are important factors affecting bio-degradation. Complete degradation of pesticides may occur through the Krebs cycle. Four major possibilities for microbial transformation of pesti-cides have been postulated (Bollag, 1974). In fungi, the best known transfor-mations take place through cometabolism. The important biochemical reactions in the fungal degradation of pesticides are alkylation, dealkylation, amide or ester hydrolysis, dehalogenation, dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, ether cleavage, ring cleavage, oxidation, reduction, condensation, and conju-gate formation.
6.2 CLASSIFICATION
It is difﬁ  cult to classify pesticides into different categories. Howev er , based 
on their applications in agriculture, animals, and humans, pesticides are divided into three categories: insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides are further classiﬁ  ed into different 
categories based on chemical composition and organic grouping. A global compendium of pesticides has been edited by T omlin (2000). This includes the chemical structure, discipline and class, nomenclature, general and trade names, classes, physical chemistry details, patents, modes of action, toxicol-ogy proﬁ  les, ecotoxicity data, and environmental fate information.
6.3 BIOSENSORS FOR DETECTION OF PESTICIDES
Classical analytical methods for pesticide analysis include high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), supercritical ﬂ uid chromatography (SFC), enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), 
and spectrophotometric methods. Of these, the most widely used method is high-resolution gas chromatography with an element-speciﬁ  c detector. Com-
monly used GC detectors include the electron capture detector (ECD), nitro-gen phosphorus detector (NPS), and ﬂ  ame photometric detector (FPD) for 
the detection of chlorinated, nitrogen-containing, and organophosphorus pes-ticides, respectively. Electrolytic conductivity detectors (ELCDs) and atomic emission detectors (AEDs) are also used. Quantiﬁ  cation of pesticides is mea-
sured by GC-MS, and this has become a common method of identiﬁ  cation 
and conﬁ  rmation. However, these analytical methods are time consuming 
and expensive, as they require sample preconcentration and sometimes derivation.Biosensors are analytical devices responsible for converting biochemical 
reactions into electronic signals that can be processed, transmitted, and measured. Biosensors usually consist of a bioactive material such as enzyme, antibody, or binding protein, whole cell, or organelle in intimate contact with a transducer. These are analyte-speciﬁ  c, rapid, reliable, portable, inexpensive, 
sensitive, and automated devices. The transducers may be amperometric, potentiometric, ﬂ  uorimetric, piezoelectric, ﬁ  ber optic, chemiluminescence, or 
based on semiconductor or ion-sensitive ﬁ  eld-effect transistor techniques. 
Biosensors can provide faster on-site results for the monitoring of sources of pesticides in the environment. Based on the type of bioactive material used, biosensors can be classiﬁ  ed into four categories: (1) enzyme-based biosensors, 
(2) immunosensors, (3) receptor-based biosensors, and (4) cell/tissue-based biosensors. Various types of biosensors for the detection of pesticides have been described by Rekha et al. (2000).
In biosensors, ﬂ  ow injection analysis (FIA) systems are generally employed 
for continuous analysis. The quality of a biosensor depends on certain techni-cal and functional features, such as selectivity, sensitivity, and detection limit, linearity of signal response, stability and operating life, response time, and recovery time (Alexander, 1990). Several factors are known to inﬂ  uence the 
performance of biosensors. These factors are enzyme concentration, immo-bilization of enzymes, inﬂ  uence of immobilization on enzyme kinetics, inﬂ  u-
ence of substrate concentration, and the inﬂ  uence of pH, temperature, and 
solvents. Several biosensors have been developed in Germany for the detec-tion of pesticides in soil and water samples (Anon., 1996).
Enzyme-based biosensors involve enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions, 
forming a product or the disappearance of electroactive substrate. Cholines-terase and tyrosinase are the principal enzymes used for the detection of pesticides. A ferromagnetic biosensor has also been used for the assay of organophosphorus pesticides (Khavkin and Khavkin, 1996). A photothermal biosensor containing acetyl cholinesterase has been employed for the detec-tion of paraoxon, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon in tap water at a low concentra-tion of 0.2 ng (Pogacnik and Franko, 1999). Atrazine and carbamate pesticides can be determined by tyrosinase inhibition using an amperometric biosensor (Besombes et al., 1995).
Immunosensors are devices that detect antigen binding to a speciﬁ  c anti-
body by coupling the immunochemical reaction to the surface of a transducer. Developments in immunosensors have focused interest on commercializing immunosensors in the clinical, food, and environmental areas (Gizeli and Lowe, 1996). These biosensors offer both the high speciﬁ  city of immunologi-
cal methods such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) and ELISA and low detection limits of electrochemical systems. Antibodies with a piezoelectric-based transducer are employed as a biological component in immunosensors. These methods can attain good sensitivity for the determination of pesticides in drinking water. Highly sensitive quartz crystal immunosensors are employed for the multisample detection of herbicides in water.BIOSENSORS FOR DETECTION OF PESTICIDES 183184 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PESTICIDES
Atrazine has been detected in the concentration range 0.001 to 1 ng/ml and 
the detection limit 0.001 ng/ml (Yokoyama et al., 1995). A rapid assay based on an immunoenzyme electrode and peroxidase conjugates have been devel-oped for the determination of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) (Dzantiev et al., 1996). Triazine herbicides can be determined by an atrazine–BSA–Eu(III)–chelate conju-gate as a ﬂ  uorescence marker to detect analyte–antibody reaction (Wortberg 
et al., 1995). A range of commercially available immunosensors are available for the detection of pesticides in soil and water (Kramer, 1996).
A new label, laccase from Coriolus hirsutus , has been used for solid-phase 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of 2,4-D (Zherdev et al., 1999). This system allowed detection of 2,4-D in concentrations to 10 to 20 ng/ml within 1.5 to 2 hours. Isolated plant or animal receptors can be employed to devise receptor-based biosensors. Cell- and tissue-based biosensors are more prom-ising for the monitoring of pollutants. A mushroom-based biosensor has been developed for the monitoring of diethyldithiocarbamates (Wang et al., 1996). Different types of amperometric biosensors based on Synechococcus cyano-
bacteria have been discussed for use in determining the presence pesticides, phenolics, and heavy metals at low concentration of 20 ppm in surface water and groundwater (Rawson and Gaisford, 1990). A lipid membrane-based biosensor is a rapid technique for the analysis of mixtures for triazine herbi-cides (Nikolelis and Siontorou, 1996). Multianalyte measurement (measure-ment of a number of pesticides of the same class and different classes) is a big problem in the commercialization of pesticide biosensors. It is important to develop and integrate software into the biosensor-based analytical systems.
6.4 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF INSECTICIDES
The application of insecticides enjoyed popularity in tropical countries during 
the middle of the twentieth century. In the past decades their use has declined, due to various known levels of toxicity to human health and the environment. Table 6.1 notes the rates of degradation and mineralization and metabolic products of various insecticides by fungi.
6.4.1 Chlorinated Compounds
The chlorinated insecticides, including DDT, aldrin, dieldrin, heptachlor, 
endrin, chlordane, and endosulfan, are of major environmental concern. DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)ethane] is an insecticide used exten-sively since the 1940s and banned in most industrialized nations in 1972. The bacterial degradation of DDT involves reductive dechlorination, oxidation, decarboxylation, and subsequently, ring cleavage. The bioremediation of DDT-contaminated soils has been described by Foght et al. (2001).TABLE 6.1 Fungal Degradation of Insecticides

186Certain fungi, such as Mucor alternans  (Anderson and Lichtenstein, 1971), 
Fusarium oxysporum  (Engst and Kujawa, 1968), and Trichoderma viride
(Matsumura and Bousch, 1968), are known to degrade DDT for a long time. The pathways of degradation of DDT by bacteria and fungi appear to be similar. Ligninolytic fungi also have the ability to degrade DDT, and the major work has focused on Phanerochaete chrysosporium . A pathway for the 
degradation of DDT by the white-rot fungus P.chrysosporium  has been 
postulated by Bumpus and Aust (1987) and Bumpus et al. (1993a) and is depicted by Foght et al. (2001). The rate and extent of mineralization of [
14C]dicofol and [14C]methoxychlor, a [14C]DDT analog, are substantially 
higher than those of [14C]DDT. The fungus is known to produce lignin per-
oxidase (LiP), which mineralizes DDT. Formation of DDD [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)ethane] occurs during initial nonligninolytic phase and is subsequently degraded. This suggests the formation of DDD by a mechanism different from a lignin-degrading system. The mineralization of [
14C]DDE is slower than that of DDT (Bumpus et al., 1993a). The extent of 
mineralization of DDT by P. chrysosporium  depends on the source of carbon 
(Fernando et al., 1989). Cellulose and starch prove better carbon sources in supporting [
14C]DDT mineralization, and 14CO 2 evolution stops on exhaus-
tion of the carbon supply. The role of LiP is still not fully understood in the mineralization of DDT. However, the mineralization of DDT coincides with the production of LiP. LiP inhibitors such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) also inhibit DDT min-eralization. It appears that DDT is degraded through cooxidation by a media-tor such as v eratryl alcohol (Khindaria et al., 1995). I t is also possible that LiPs may oxidize DDT metabolites other than DDT.
P. chrysosporium dechlorinates [ring-
14C]methoxychlor [1,1,1-trichloro-
2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethane] to three metabolites (Grifoll and Hammel, 1997). All three metabolites were mineralized. The fungus converted both 1-dechloro and 2-hydroxy derivatives to a 1-dechloro-2-hydroxy derivative, suggesting that dechlorination does not precede hydroxylation, or vice versa. P. chrysosporium  caused signiﬁ  cant bioconversion of [
14C]aldrin, [14C]dieldrin, 
[14C]heptachlor, and [14C]mirex, but these compounds were poorly mineral-
ized (Kennedy et al., 1990). Species of soil fungi (e.g., Fusarium ,Penicillium ,
Rhizopus , and Trichoderma ) have the ability to convert heptachlor to hepta-
chlor epoxide. Methods have been developed for P. chrysosporium to inocu-
late soils contaminated with organochlorines (Lestan et al., 1996).
Trichoderma harzianum degrades the cyclodiene insecticide endosulfan 
(1,4,5,6,7,7-hexachloro-5-norbornene-2,3-dimethanol cyclic sulﬁ  te) under 
various nutrient media throughout its growth stages (Katayama and Mat-sumura, 1993). The degradation of endosulfan is catalyzed by the oxidation of endosulfan to endosulfan sulfate followed by hydrolysis to endosulfan diol. Exogenous addition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) enhances endosulfan metabolism. Formation of the initial meta-bolic product of endosulfan sulfate is catalyzed by the major oxidative enzyme FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF INSECTICIDES 187188 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PESTICIDES
system (oxidase) in T. harzianum . Endosulfan sulfate is produced as a major 
metabolite due to endosulfan degradation by many soil fungi (Martens, 1972). Other metabolites (e.g., endoether, endohydroxyether, chlorendic acid, and endolacetate) have also been identiﬁ  ed. Soil fungi can be classiﬁ  ed into two 
categories: one type that accumulates endosulfan sulfate and a second type that converts endosulfan sulfate metabolically to endosulfan diol (El-Zorgani and Omer, 1974; Martens, 1976). None of the species of Trichoderma  is 
known as an endosulfan degrader other than T. harzianum , which belongs to 
the second type of fungi. Hydrolysis of endosulfan sulfate to endosulfan diol can be catalyzed by hydrolases (e.g., sulfatase). It appears that hydrolyzing enzymes are present in the second type of fungi, in addition to oxidative enzymes. The metabolic pathway for endosulfan metabolism by P. chryso-
sporium  BU-1 is shown in Figure 6.1 (Kullman and Matsumura, 1996). 
Initially, endosulfan is either oxidized to endosulfan sulfate, a terminal end product, or hydrolyzed to non-sulfur-containing endosulfan metabolites. Initial hydrolysis of endosulfan produces endosulfan diol, which is further oxidized to endosulfan hydroxyether followed by the formation of either endosulfan lactone or the putative endosulfan dialdehyde. Piperonyl butox-ide, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, inhibits the oxidation of endosulfan to endosulfan sulfate and enhances the hydrolysis of endosulfan to endosulfan

(e.g., hydrolytic and oxidative).
Lindane (1 α,2α,3β,4α,5α,6β-hexachlorocyclohexane, γ-HCH) has been 
used extensively in the world despite its persistence in the environment. P.
chrysosporium  can biotransform [14C]lindane in liquid culture at 25°C-air 
conditions, resulting in the formation of some polar metabolites and the release of [
14C]CO 2 (Mougin et al., 1996). Transformation of tetrachlorocy-
clohexene as a substrate in liquid culture also conﬁ  rms the identity of three 
polar degradation products and carbon dioxide. Lindane appears to be com-pletely mineralized or converted to water-soluble products in both batch and immobilized packed-bed bioreactor systems by the subtropical white-rot fungus DSPM95 (Tekere et al., 2002). MnP and laccase are produced in both systems, but high enzyme levels are not sustained for longer periods in the packed-bed system. Lindane was degraded in agitated liquid cultures by Pleurotus ostreatus  using the central composite design as a second-order 
methodology (Rigas et al., 2005). The maximum biodegradation of lindane was 25.8 mg per gram of initial lindane and per gram of biomass at 1.89 g/l nitrogen content, 12.45 days, and 24°C.
6.4.2 Organophosphorus Compounds
The organophosphorus insecticides are used extensively in agriculture and 
are easily degraded by bacteria in the environment. A number of them have half-lives on the order of several months and appear to be moderately persistent. The organophosphorus insecticides include malathion, parathion, diazion, fenitrothion, fenitrooxon, disulfoton, fonofos, and bromophos. Mala-thion and parathion were used widely in the past, due to the broad spectrum and high insecticide activities and are of great environmental concern. Hydro-lysis is the principal mechanism of degradation of organophosphorus insecti-cides, and it can be both chemical and biological in nature. Transformation of malathion to β-monoacid and dicarboxylic acid occurs due to carboxyes-
terase activity by Aspergillus oryzae  (Lewis et al., 1975). These metabolites 
were subsequently converted to thio- and inorganic phosphates. Penicillium 
waksmanii  isolated from ﬂ  ooded acid sulfate soil has the capacity to degrade 
parathion to aminoparathion (Rao and Sethunathan, 1974). The chlorinated pyridinyl ring of chlorpyrifos and the phenyl ring of fonofos undergo cleavage during biodegradation by P. chrysosporium (Bumpus et al., 1993b). Several 
species of a mixed population of fungi, such as Alternaria alternata ,Cepha-
losporium  sp., Cladosporium cladosporioides ,Cladorrhinum brunnescens ,
Fusarium sp., Rhizoctonia solani , and Trichoderma viride , reveal the degra-
dation of chlorpyrifos in liquid culture (Al-Mihanna et al., 1998). The degra-d a t i o n  o f  c h l o rp y r i f o s  p r o v e s  m o r e  e fﬁ  cient by mixed populations than by 
pure cultures of fungi. Fenitrothion and fenitrooxon are degraded enzymati-cally by T. viride  in the presence of alternative nutrients (Baarschers and 
Heitland, 1986). Of three white-rot fungi, Coriolus versicolor is the best FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF INSECTICIDES 189190 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PESTICIDES
performer to degrade chlorpyrifos in a biobed matrix (Bending et al., 2002). 
The degradation by fungi of organophosphorus compounds of lesser environ-mental concern (e.g., diazion, disulfoton, fonofos, and bromophos) has also been described (Singh et al., 1991).
6.4.3 Miscellaneous Compounds
Hydramethylnon (HMN) is an amidinohydrazone-type insecticide used for 
the control of red introduced ﬁ  re ants (RIFA). Certain soil fungi (Abernathy 
and Walker, 1993) can decompose HMN easily. HMN is degraded in soil with a half-life of 14 to 25 days. The disappearance of HMN is correlated with the LiP activity of P. chrysosporium . However, addition of nutrient-N 
suppresses both HMN disappearance and LiP activity. Two metabolites, p-
(triﬂ uoromethyl)cinnamic acid (TFCA) and p-(triﬂ  uoromethyl)benzoic acid 
(TFBA), are produced as a result of degradation of HMN by P. chrysospo-
rium . Further metabolism by P. chrysosporium  c o n v e rt s  TF C A  t o  TFB A,  
which is subsequently metabolized via the meta -ﬁ ssion pathway. Several keto-
acids are produced in cultures of P. chrysosporium  incubated with TFBA or 
TFCA. The liberation of ﬂ  uoride from HMN has not been detected. A tenta-
tive pathway for the degradation of HMN by P. chrysosporium has been 
described. The degradation by fungi of carbamate compounds of lesser envi-ronmental concern (e.g., carbaryl, carbofuran, and aldicarb) has also been described (Singh et al., 1991). Salama (1998) showed the degradation of car-bofuran by pure cultures of Aspergillus niger  and Fusarium graminearum .
6.5 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF HERBICIDES
More than 2500 pesticides are currently in use in the world (Anon., 1998). 
Over 150 chemicals are used as herbicides throughout the world (Singh et al., 1991). The herbicides constitute 45%, followed by insecticides (35%) and fungicides (15%), of all the pesticides used in the developed countries. Their count is different in tropic and subtropic regions, where the use of insecticides is highest. Most of the literature on the detoxiﬁ  cation of herbicides by micro-
organisms (i.e., fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes) is based on studies in developed countries. The metabolic pathways for the degradation of herbi-cides by these microorganisms are partially known. However, the role of fungi in the detoxiﬁ  cation of herbicides has been known for several decades. Table 
6.2 notes the rates of degradation and mineralization and metabolic products of various herbicides by fungi.
6.5.1 Phenoxyalkanoate Compounds
A plethora of literature is available on the microbial degradation of herbicides 
of phenoxyalkanoic acid derivatives. However, less attention is given to the TABLE 6.2 Fungal Degradation of Herbicides

fungal degradation of these compounds. Penicillium megasporum  and Peni-
cillium  sp. utilize 2,4-D as a carbon source (Torstensson et al., 1975). A small 
amount (2 to 3%) of 14CO 2 evolves from [14C]-2,4-D by Hendersonula toru-
loidea  (Wolf and Martin, 1976). A strain of Aspergillus niger  dechlorinates 
2,4-D prior to ring cleavage (Sahasrabudhe and Modi, 1987).
Extensive degradation of [14C]-2,4,5-T by P. chrysosporium  can occur in 
nitrogen-limited aqueous cultures and in [14C]-2,4,5-T-contaminated soil 
amended with ground corncobs (Ryan and Bumpus, 1989). The mass balance analysis shows the formation of water-soluble metabolites. However, HPLC and TLC of methylene chloride–extractable material reveal the presence of polar and nonpolar metabolites. Only about 5% of the [
14C]-2,4,5-T in 
the cultures remains undegraded. The fungus mineralizes [14C]-2,4,5-T–
contaminated nonsterile soil amended with ground corncobs, which suggests the possibility of development of a practical treatment system to detoxify 2,4,5-T-contaminated soil and water.
Wild type and a peroxidase-negative mutant of P. chrysosporium  can 
mineralize 2,4-D and mixtures of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T (Yadav and Reddy, 1993). LiP and MnP are not required for 2,4-D mineralization. Higher rates of min-eralization occur when these compounds are tested in combination than when tested alone. A mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T leads to simultaneous mineral-ization of 46.5%, and there is no mutual inhibition of degradation. The efﬁ  -
cacy of degradation of 2,4-D by four fungi is regulated by culture parameters ( V r o u m s i a  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 9 ) .  A n  i n i t i a l  c o n c e n t r a t i o n  o f  2 0  m g / l  o f  2 , 4 - D ,  l o w  concentrations of glucose (5 g/l), and 2.4 mM of nitrogen are found to be best for degradation.
6.5.2 Phenylamide Compounds
Most of the herbicides used in agriculture belong to the phenylamide class of 
compounds and are based on substituted anilines. Phenylamide compounds can be subdivided into three categories: acylanilides, phenylureas, and phe-nylcarbamates. Kaufman and Blake (1973) described the microbial degrada-tion of several acetamide, acylanilide, phenylurea, carbamate, and toluidine herbicides.
6.5.2.1 Acylanilides.  Acylanilides include propanil, alachlor, butachlor, 
propachlor, metolachlor, karsil, dicryl, and others. Certain soil fungi have the ability to hydrolyze most acylanilide herbicides by acylamidase, resulting in the formation of anilines and an aliphatic group (Bartha and Pramer, 1970). Species of Penicillium  and Pullularia  and Fusarium solani  utilize most 
of these herbicides as the sole sources of carbon and energy. Lanzilotta and Pramer (1970a,b) reported the release of 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA) by hydrolysis during growth of F. solani  on propanil. DCA and 3,3 ′,4,4′-
tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB) are also released in propanil-treated soil (Bartha and Pramer, 1970).The ﬁ  rst report of degradation of alachlor (2-chloro- N-methoxymethyl-
N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)acetamide) to a number of 14C polar and nonpolar 
metabolites by the white-rot fungi Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  and Phlebia 
tremellosa  was that of Ferrey et al. (1994). Alachlor was not recovered from 
the culture of C. subvermispora  after 122 days, while 11% was collected from 
combined aqueous and wood extract fractions of the culture of P. tremellosa.
Metabolites appear to be produced through different degradative pathways. Mineralization of alachlor was shown to be slow in agricultural soils, less than 3% in 30 days (Novick et al., 1986) and 120 days (Yen et al., 1994). Cunning-
hamella elegans  t r a n s f o r m s  9 8 . 6 %  o f  [
14C]alachlor, and hydroxylation of 
one of the aryl ethyl side chains is responsible for the metabolism ( P o t h u l u r i  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 3 ) .  I s o m e r s  o f  2 - c h l o r o - N-(methoxymethyl)- N-
(2-ethyl-6-(1-hydroxyethyl)-phenyl)acetamide and 2-chloro- N-(2,6-
diethylphenyl)acetamide are identiﬁ  ed as the major metabolic products, with 
2-chloro- N-(methoxymethyl)- N-(2-vinyl-6-ethylphenyl)acetamide as the 
minor metabolic product. These hydroxylated products are considered less toxic than alachlor. Levanon (1993) reported alkyl side-chain cleavage of alachlor with minimum mineralization of the ring carbon due to fungal activ-ity. The side chain of alachlor is utilized as a carbon source by microorganisms ( S u n  e t  a l . ,  1 9 90 ).  C. elegans  has the ability to metabolize metolachlor to 
hydroxylated products that are considered less toxic than the parent com-pound (Pothuluri et al., 1997). As of this date, no isolated microorganism is known to mineralize the aromatic ring of alachlor to CO
2.
F. solani  degraded butachlor [2-chloro-2 ′,6′-diethyl- N-(butoxymethyl)
acetanilide], resulting in the formation of at least 30 to 32 metabolites ( C h a k r a b o r t y  a n d  B h a t t a c h a r y y a ,  1 9 9 1 ) .  O f  t h e s e ,  t h r e e  c o m p o u n d s ,  2,6-diethylaniline (III), 2 ′,6′-diethylacetanilide (IV), and 2-chloro-2 ′,6′-
diethylacetanilide (XII) were conﬁ  rmed in F. solani  and F. oxysporum . Nine 
other degradative products (II, V to XI, and XIII) could be identiﬁ  ed only by 
GC-MS in F. solani . The structures of the remaining compounds were not 
determined. Possible pathways for the butachlor degradation by F. solani  are 
shown in Figure 6.2. The main degradative pathways include dechlorination, dehydrogenation, debutoxymethylation, C-dealkylation, N-dealkylation, O-dealkylation, hydroxylation, and cyclization. Mucor sufui  NTU-358 degrades 
butachlor, forming 8 to 12 metabolites (Chen and Wu, 1978). More than 10 metabolites have been found as a result of the metabolism of butachlor by Chaetomium globosum  (Lee, 1978). Similar degradative pathways of α-
chloroacetanilide herbicides have been revealed in bacteria and fungi. Propa-chlor can be detoxiﬁ  e d  b y  s o m e  s p e c i e s  o f  Aspergillus ,Penicillium , and 
Trichoderma viride  (Rankov and Valev, 1977). McGahen and Tiedje (1978) 
studied the metabolism of antor and metolachlor using Chaetomium 
globosum .
6.5.2.2 Phenylureas.  Phenylureas, one of the most prominent and diversi-
ﬁ ed groups of herbicides, were discovered in the early 1950s. About 25 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF HERBICIDES 195196 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PESTICIDES

[Reprinted from Chakraborty and Bhattacharyya (1991), copyright © with permis-sion from Elsevier.]herbicides of phenylurea origin were marketed. Major phenylureas of 
environmental concern are linuron, diuron, chlortoluron, and isoproturon, and of lesser environmental concern are monolinuron, monuron, and others. The important mechanisms of phenylurea detoxiﬁ  cation are dealkylation, N-
alkylation, N-methoxylation, or dimethylation. Linuron decomposes with the formation of metabolites by Aspergillus niger ,Geotrichum candidum ,Tricho-
derma viride , and two species of Cladosporium  ( G l a d  e t  a l . ,  1 9 8 1 ).  O f  1 2  
species, Botrytis cinerea depletes linuron almost completely, and Sordaria 
superba  depletes it 25% in liquid media (Bordjiba et al., 2001).
Rhizoctonia solani  has been shown to degrade diuron, chlorbromuron, and 
a wide variety of other substituted phenylureas (e.g., fenuron, ﬂ  uometuron, 
linuron, metobromuron) (Weinberger and Bollag, 1972). Transformation of t h e s e  h e r b i c i d e s  o c c u r s  i r r e s p e c t i v e  o f  v a r i a t i o n s  i n  r i n g  s t r u c t u r e s  a n d  functional groups. This broad substrate speciﬁ  city behavior indicates that the 
fungus contains certain enzymes or enzymatic systems. Stepwise demethyl-ation occurred during transformation of ﬂ  uometuron by R. solani , with the 
formation of two major metabolites (Rickard and Camper, 1978). Oxidative dealkylation of diuron, monuron, and three other phenylureas by Cunning-
hamella echinulata has been shown to take place (Tillmanns et al., 1978).
About 4%, 7%, and 11% of the strains of soil fungi belonging to different 
taxonomic groups deplete about 50% each of chlortoluron, diuron, and isoproturon, respectively (Vroumsia et al., 1996). On GS medium, R. solani
transformed chlortoluron completely after 15 days and diuron and isoproturon after 10 days. Constitutive and intracellular enzymes appear to be responsible for the degradation of three phenylureas. Of more than 20 species, Mortierella 
hyalina  and Mucor racemosus  degraded chlortoluron by 50% or more (Seigle-
Murandi et al., 1991, 1992). Of 100 strains of Micromycetes, comprising Asco-mycetes, Basidiomycetes, and yeasts, nearly 17, 4, and 2 strains depleted 50% of isoproturon, diuron, and chlortoluron, respectively (Khadrani et al., 1999). The best degraders were Bjerkandera adusta  and Oxysporus sp. B. adusta
produced MnP and LiP, and fungal biomass did not exhibit adsorption. Of ﬁ  ve 
yeasts, Cryptococcus albidus  degraded chlortoluron (23%), diuron (28%), and 
isoproturon (54%) efﬁ  ciently. This indicates a potential to treat contaminated 
soils and wastewater and use in a bioremediation process. Of 31 species, Botrytis cinerea  removed metobromuron from the medium almost completely 
(Bordjiba et al., 2001). Coriolus versicolor  degraded diuron almost completely 
in liquid culture after 42 days (Bending et al., 2002). All other fungi showed less than 22% degradation. [
14C]Diuron ring residue analyses reveal less than 
60% ring-C remaining in cultures of Coriolus versicolor  and Stereum hirsutum
and over 77% remaining in cultures of Hypholoma fasciculare  and Agrocybe 
semiorbicularis . No correlation existed between the presumptive ligninolytic 
activity and the degradation of diuron.
6.5.2.3 Phenylcarbamates.  Phenylcarbamates, including propham and 
chlorpropham, exhibit persistence in soils for a short duration due to FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF HERBICIDES 197198 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PESTICIDES
effectiveness at low applications. Phenylcarbamates are degraded by micro-
organisms, including utilization of propham and chlorpropham, by several species of fungi (McClure, 1974). 2-Amino-4-chlorophenol has been detected in chlorpropham-treated soil using Fusarium oxysporum  (Fletcher and 
Kaufman, 1979).
6.5.3 s-Triazine Compounds
Extensive use of chlorinated s-triazine compounds has contributed to con-
tamination of surface water and groundwater in many countries. s-Triazine 
compounds are divided into two classes, such as chlorinated and sulfur-containing s-triazine compounds. s-Triazine chlorinated compounds are 
atrazine and simazine, and sulfur-containing compounds are ame -tryne, prometryne, and simetryne. Atrazine [2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6-(isopropylamino)-1,3,5-triazine] is a widely used herbicide and is highly persistent in the environment, with a half-life of 300 to 500 days. An accept-a b l e  c o n c e n t r a t i o n  o f  a t r a z i n e  i n  w a t e r  i s  l e s s  t h a n  3  μg/l (USEPA, 1991). 
C o o k  ( 1 9 8 7 )  r e v i e w e d  t h e  b i o d e g r a d a t i o n  o f  s- t r i a z i n e s  i n  w a s t e w a t e r  b y  
microorganisms. Alva and Singh (1990) described the sorption of four herbi-cides, including simazine, at various horizons at two soils.
Several soil fungi have been shown to release 
14CO 2 from ring- and side-
chain-labeled atrazine (Kaufman and Blake, 1970). Phanerochaete chryso-
sporium  mineralized 24% of atrazine after 16 days through the ethyl group 
(Mougin et al., 1994). More-polar hydroxylated and/or N-alkylated metabo-lites are produced during degradation. Further degradation of dealkylated metabolites does not occur; thus it accumulates in the medium. N-Dealkylation is more common than hydroxylation in fungi, resulting in direct or secondary metabolism leading to hydrolysis of atrazine.
Biobeds  are on-farm bioremediation systems used to retain pesticides and 
facilitate natural attentuation. Fogg (2001) discussed uses of biobeds related to the behavior of pesticides in soils and water. Selected white-rot fungi can be used in on-farm pesticide bioremediation systems. Hypholoma fasciculare
and Stereum hirsutum  are the best degraders of terbuthylazine in liquid 
culture (Bending et al., 2002). Coriolus versicolor  exhibited the highest ability 
to degrade atrazine in liquid media. H. fasciculare attained a high level of 
degradation of atrazine in the biobed matrix.
Pleurotus pulmonarius  degrades atrazine in liquid culture and produces 
mainly N-dealkylated metabolites such as deethylatrazine (CAIT), deisopro-pylatrazine (CEAT), deethyldeisopropylatrazine (CAAT), and a hydroxy-propyl metabolite, hydroxyisopropylatrazine (CEIOT) (Masaphy et al., 1993). These metabolites constitute more than 75% of the disappearance of atrazine. Solid-state fermentation is suggested as a means to detoxify carbofuran and atrazine (Berry et al., 1993). Pleurotus pulmonarius  supported the degrada-
tion of atrazine during solid-state fermentation on a mixture of cotton and wheat straw (CWS) (Masaphy et al., 1996a). Atrazine does not mineralize in 6 weeks. Unlike degradation in liquid culture, atrazine is transformed into 
chlorinated and dechlorinated metabolites as a result of inoculated fungus and bacterial population. The dechlorinated metabolites include hydroxyat-razine (OEIT), N-isopropylammeline (OAIT), N-ethylammeline (OEAT), 
and ammeline (OAAT). Atrazine is detoxiﬁ  ed in an organic matrix by both 
adsorption and biodegradation. Atrazine transformation by manganese also enhanced the whole-cell culture of Pleurotus pulmonarius  (both as MnCl
2
and MnSO 4) at a concentration of up to 300 μM (Masaphy et al., 1996b). The 
N-dealkylated metabolites are accumulated to a larger extent than propylhy-droxylated metabolites. The brown color of the mycelium, lipid peroxidation, oxygenase and peroxidating activities, the cytochrome P450 concentration, and interaction between atrazine and cell extract are increased. Antioxidants prove inhibitory either on atrazine transformation by the mycelium or on a c c u m u l a t i o n  o f  m e t a b o l i t e s .  I t  s e e m s  t h a t  M n ( I I )  s t i m u l a t e s  o x i d a t i v e  activity, which in turn is responsible for enhancing the biotransformation of atrazine.
Metamitron is a member of the 1,2,4-triazinone herbicides. Of 21 species, 
only Alternaria solani ,Drechslera australiensis , and Absidia fusca  reduce 10 
to 16% of metamitron in the medium (Bordjiba et al., 2001). Cunninghamella 
echinulata  and Rhizopus japonicus  degrade metamitron to desaminometami-
tron by desamination (Engelhardt and Wallnofer, 1978). Botrytis cinerea ,
Sordaria superba , and A. fusca  degraded 61%, 64%, and 95% of metribuzin 
[4-amino-6- t-butyl-3-methylthio-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one] after 5 days, 
respectively (Bordjiba et al., 2001). C.  echinulata  and R. japonicus  can com-
pletely transform metribuzin after 4 weeks (Schilling et al., 1985). During degradation of metribuzin,  C. echinulata  produces two metabolites, desami-
nometribuzin and desaminodiketometribuzin. Other species of fungi (i.e., Aspergillus niger ,Penicillium lilacinum , and Fusarium oxysporum ) showed 
27 to 45% degradation of metribuzin.
6.5.4 Miscellaneous Compounds
Miscellaneous compounds include herbicides of lesser or minor environmen-
tal concern. The degradation of dinitroanilines, comprising triﬂ  uralin, nitra-
lin, dinitramine, beneﬁ  n, and so on, and thiocarbamates, comprising molinate 
and diallate, has been described (Singh et al., 1991). Transformation of tri-ﬂ uralin by fungi, fungal metabolites, and degradative pathways have been 
depicted by Zayed et al. (1983). F. oxysporum  is one of the main fungal iso-
lates capable of the degradation of carbamate (Lee, 1984). Savin and Amador (1998) reported on microbial degradation of norﬂ  urazon in a bog soil.
6.6 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF FUNGICIDES
Fungicides are used against various types of plant diseases caused by fungi. 
They were applied rigorously against plant pathogens in the 1950s and 1960s. FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF FUNGICIDES 199200 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PESTICIDES
In recent years, the use of fungicides has declined considerably due to the 
high toxicity and accumulative nature in the environment. Table 6.3 notes the rates of degradation and mineralization and metabolic products of certain fungicides by fungi.
6.6.1 Organomercurial Compounds
Organomercurial compounds include semesan, panodrench, and panogen 
and were used to control plant diseases since the beginning of the twentieth century. Their use was stopped several decades ago, due to their high toxicity, so they are of minor environmental concern. Semesan is rendered inactive by inoculation with Penicillium  and Trichoderma viride  (Spanis and Munnecke, 
1962; Spanis et al., 1962).
6.6.2 Organosulfur Compounds
Organosulfur compounds, include the dithiocarbamates, which enjoyed pop-
ularity globally in the 1960s. Two categories of dithiocarbamates are recog-nized, monoalkyl and dialkyldithiocarbamates. Monoalkyldithiocarbamates include maneb, zineb, and mancozeb, and dialkyldithiocarbamates include ferbam, thiram, and ziram. Thiram is detoxiﬁ  ed in soil by Pythium ultimatum
(Munnecke and Mickail, 1967) and Rhizoctonia solani  (Chatrath and Raju, 
1986). Of three white-rot fungi, Stereum hirsutum  performs best on iprodi-
one, a dicarboximide, on a biobed matrix (Bending et al., 2002). Hydroxyl-ation of trans -2-ﬂ uorocycloalkyl N-phenylcarbamates with Beauveria bassiana
occurs at the 4-position, resulting in a mixture of diastereomeric products (Haufe et al., 2002). In one study, about 93% the dicarboximide fungicide vinclozolin [3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-5-vinyl-1,3-oxazolidine-2,4-dione] was transformed after 96 hours into four metabolites by Cunningha-
mella elegans  ( P o t h u l u r i  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 0 ) .  B i o t r a n s f o r m a t i o n  o c c u r r e d  o n  t h e  
oxazolidine-2,4-dione portion of vinclozolin. The metabolites identiﬁ  ed were 
the 3R and 3S isomers of 3 ′,5′-dichloro-2,3,4-trihydroxy-2-methylbutyranilide 
(II, III), N-(2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-oxobuten-3-yl)-3,5-dichlorophenyl-1-
carbamic acid (I), and 3 ′,5′-dichloro-2-hydroxy-2-methylbut-3-enanilide (IV). 
A scheme of transformation of vinclozolin either by hydration and/or decar-boxylation is shown in Figure 6.3. Vinclozolin is metabolized by the addition of water to the ester group to form metabolite I. This is a major metabolite and is accounted for 50% of the total metabolism. Decarboxylation of the oxazolidine portion of vinclozolin resulted in the formation of metabolite IV. Metabolites II and III were formed by an epoxide hydrolase reaction via ethylene dihydroxylation of metabolite (IV). These two novel metabolites accounted for 33% of the total metabolism at 168 hours of incubation. Thus, biotransformation of vinclozolin by C. elegans  took place via multiple-site 
oxidation.TABLE 6.3 Fungal Degradation of Fungicides

Organophosphorus compounds include pyrazophos, kitazin P, edifenphos 
(hinosan), and inezin. Pyricularia oryzae  metabolizes pyrazophos into certain 
compounds (de Waard, 1974). The mycelium of P. oryzae  transformed edi-
fenphos to ortho -phosphoric acid in a study by Uesugi and Tomizawa (1971a). 
A plausible degradation pathway of edifenphos, including des- S-phenylation, 
was also depicted. A similar degradation pathway for inezin by P. oryzae  has 
been reported (Uesugi and Tomizawa, 1971b). In inezin, hydroxylation occurs at the meta -position rather than at the para -position as in edifenphos degrada-
tion by P. oryzae .
6.6.4 Aromatic and Heterocyclic Compounds
Aromatic compounds include quintozene [pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB)] 
and chloroneb. Heterocyclic compounds include classes of systemic fungi-cides, such as benzimidazoles (benomyl, carbendazim), carboxylic acid ani-lides (carboxin and mebenil), and triazolylmethane (triadimefon). Degradation of PCNB by several fungi and actinomycetes in pure culture has been known for four decades (Chacko et al., 1966; Nakanishi and Oku, 1969). Rhizoctonia 
solani  demethylates chloroneb to a nontoxic metabolic product (Hock and 
Sisler, 1969). Coriolus versicolor  and Stereum hirsutum degraded 40% and 
54% of a phenylamide fungicide and metalaxyl, respectively, on a biobed matrix after 42 days (Bending et al., 2002).
6.7 BIOTRANSFORMATION OF PESTICIDES BY 
FUNGAL ENZYMES
In plants and soils, isoxaﬂ  utole (5-cyclopropyl-1,2-oxazol-4-yl α,α,α-
triﬂ uoro-2-mesyl- p-tolyl ketone) is converted rapidly to its diketonitrile deriv-

Laccase from T. versicolor  is immobilized onto a hydrophilic PVDF micro-
ﬁ ltration membrane and is used for the removal of a herbicide derivative, 
N′,N′-(dimethyl)- N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)urea (2-HF) from wastewater (Jolivalt 
et al., 2000). Laccase can oxidize 2-HF into insoluble products, which are separated by crossﬂ  ow ﬁ  ltration through a microﬁ  ltration module. Laccase 
(220 U activity)-grafted membrane with a 60-cm
2 effective ﬁ  ltration area 
transforms 200 ml of a 2-HF solution of 0.1 g/l within less than 5 minutes. Most of the transformation products are insoluble and are retained by the membrane. However, HPLC measurement of pink permeates indicates that they are a small and soluble part of the oxidation products.

28% without the formation of metabolites. MnP-Tween 80 and laccase-HBT degraded the MCO levels by 15% and 5% after 24 hours, respectively. LiP did not degrade the MCO. A possible mechanism for the dechlorination of methoxychlor by MnP-Tween or laccase-HBT treatment is shown in Figure 6.4. Mechanisms are also proposed for the oxidative dehalogenation of dichlo-rophen and polymerization of bromoxynil catalyzed by versatile peroxidase (VP) from Bjerkandera adusta  ( D a v i l a - V a z q u e z  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 5 ) .

monoacid (MMA) and malathion diacid (MDA) are produced as a result of ester hydrolysis of malathion by cutinase of Fusarium oxysporum  f. sp. pisi

6.8 GENETIC MANIPULATION
Fungi can degrade a wide variety of pesticides under laboratory conditions. 
Methods to decontaminate the environment from residues of pesticides are yet to be developed. Genes for the degradation of pesticides are discovered on plasmids, transposons, and/or chromosomes in bacteria. Plausible degra-dative pathways and organization of catabolic genes can lead to the develop-ment of bioengineered microorganisms to decontaminate the environment. This can be accomplished by enhancing the degradative capabilities of exist-ing metabolic pathways either by inserting speciﬁ  c genes or by modifying 
the speciﬁ  city of existing catabolic genes or additional enzymes from other 
microorganisms. Pesticide-degrading genes have been identiﬁ  ed, isolated, 
and cloned in other organisms. A new recombinant strain is constructed by GENETIC MANIPULATION 205206 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PESTICIDES

JMP134 to the 2,4,5-T-degrading Pseudomonas cepacia  AC1100 (Haugland 
et al., 1990). This new bioengineered strain, designated RHJ1, has been shown to degrade 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T simultanously in liquid medium. Micro-bial adaptation to pesticides and the molecular aspects of pesticide degrada-tion by microorganisms have been well elucidated (Kearney and Kellog, 1985; Kumar et al., 1996).

because of its involvement in the degradation of DDT, lindane, and other pesticides. This can open doors for cloning more genes speciﬁ  c for the deg-
radation of pesticides. Furthermore, protoplast fusion of cells in speciﬁ  c fungi needs to be explored to amplify the degradative abilities related to 
pesticides.
6.9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Fungi have revealed a remarkable ability to degrade a wide array of pesti-
cides. The knowledge described above focused on the characterization of degradation and mineralization of pesticides by fungi. Metabolites were iden-tiﬁ ed in a number of cases, and degradative pathways were described in some 
cases. Certain fungi and bacteria exhibit similar types of biochemical reac-tions. Certain biochemical reactions, enzymes, transformations, and path-ways are noteworthy exclusively in fungi. Presently, little is known on the isolation of speciﬁ  c fungi with the unique ability to mineralize pesticides 
from the natural environment, and continuous efforts are required in this direction.
The current state of knowledge is derived primarily from cultural studies 
on individual microorganisms degrading individual pesticides, especially bac-teria and to a lesser extent, fungi and actinomycetes. However, microorgan-isms and pesticides do not exist in the individual state in complex environments. In soils, pesticides are always attacked simultaneously by a group of micro-organisms with their enzymes. Sometimes, degradation of a pesticide by a fungus leads to the formation of metabolic products, and further degradation is not possible, and these products are broken down by another fungus or other microorganism(s) in the soil, thus leading to partial or complete trans-formation. On the other hand, microorganisms degrade different types of pesticides present in different concentrations in the soil. This complex and heterogeneous environment of pesticides and microorganisms leads to syner-gistic or antagonistic interactions among them. The evidence suggests the removal of HMN from the soil by the combined action of photolysis at the surface and degradation by soil microbes and Phanerochaete chrysosporium
(Abernathy and Walker, 1993). A higher rate of simultaneous mineralization of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T by P. chrysosporium  is achieved than when they are each 
tested alone (Yadav and Reddy, 1993). More research is required to elucidate these interactions and the mode of action of fungal enzymes in pesticide transformations. Such knowledge will lead to a better understanding of real situations in the environment.
Adding suitable bacteria or fungi through soil enrichment techniques has 
not resulted in much mineralization of pesticides. The long-term goal is to ﬁ nd promising fungal species and reliable application methods to introduce 
into rhizospheres for enhanced degradation of pesticides. Trichoderma har-
zianum  appears to be an excellent candidate for this purpose. This species 
can thrive in various rhizospheres as a biocontroller against several plant pathogenic microbes; it has the advantage of tolerating fungicides such as benomyl, and the feasibility of a biomarker; it exhibits the ability to degrade CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 207208 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PESTICIDES
cellulose, which shows the highest competitiveness in rhizosphere. The role 
of Bjerkandera adusta  in contaminated soils requires conﬁ  rmation of its use 
in practical treatment systems (Khadrani et al., 1999). Due to the amazing versatility of biological systems, a possibility exists for the commercial use of fungi for the bioremediation of pesticides.

FUNGAL METABOLISM OF 
PHENOLS, CHLOROPHENOLS, AND PENTACHLOROPHENOL
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Phenols are widely distributed in nature, especially in plants, where these 
occur in the form of alkaloids, coumarins, ﬂ  avonoids, terpenes, tannins, and 
lignins. Phenols are also found in marine systems, produced by marine plants and animals, and are degraded by indigenous microbial populations. In 1998, 4.77 billion pounds of phenol was produced, with an expected increase of 3% per year, and ranked among the 40 most produced chemicals in the United States (ChemExpo, 1999). About 70% of industrially produced phenol is employed in the production of resins and is also used in the manufacture of plastics, biocides, disinfectants, textiles, medicines, explosives, inks, per-fumes, photographic materials, and several other products.
Phenols and halogenated phenols arise as wastes or by-products of numer-
ous industries, and their presence in waste streams is of environmental concern. Release of phenols in the environment is known in almost all indus-tries that manufacture or use phenols. Phenolics of low molecular mass include the chlorophenols, guaiacol, chloroguaiacols, chlorocatechols, and chlori-nated vanillic and syringic acids. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a general biocide whose worldwide use in wood and timber preservation has contributed severe contamination in wood-treatment plants. PCP is toxic to all forms of life because it is an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation. The well-documented toxicity and persistence of PCP in various media necessitate cleanup at

contaminated sites. Chlorophenols have also been used for wood preservation 
and a wide range of domestic, agricultural, and industrial purposes for more than 50 years and are presently widespread in the environment (Jensen, 1996). The occurrence of chlorophenols in aquatic and terrestrial food chains has also been established.
In addition to industrial production, chlorophenols are produced from 
naturally occurring phenols as a result of the bleaching of wood pulp. Phenol is regarded as a priority contaminant by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Keith and Telliard, 1979). Creosote spills have contributed to its detection in river water (Ventura et al., 1998) and in efﬂ  uents from wastewater 
treatment plants (Paxeus, 1996). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set a limit of 600 μg/l as a 24-hour average to protect freshwater aquatic 
life, not to exceed 3.4 mg/l (36 μM), and a drinking water limit of 1 μg/l 
(0.01 μM) (USEPA, 1979). The Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs) for 
the Superfund and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) pro-grams for phenol, 2-chlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol are set to the limits of 37 000 mg/kg, 63 mg/kg, and 3 mg/kg, respectively, for residential soils and 22 000 μg/l, 30 μg/l, and 0.56 μg/l, respectively, for groundwater (USEPA, 
2000).
7.2 ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES
In r ece n t y ears, a tte m p ts ha v e bee n f ocused o n de v e l op ing highl y e ff ecti v e 
technologies related to detoxiﬁ  cation of phenols. Numerous conventional 
puriﬁ  cation methods, such as solvent extraction, adsorption on activated 
carbon, and chemical oxidation, have been employed for the dephenolization of industrial wastewaters. Although these methods are effective, most suffer from serious drawbacks, due to high cost, incompleteness of puriﬁ  cation, 
formation of hazardous by-products, and applicability to a limited phenol concentration range.
7.2.1 Physicochemical Methods
During the past decade, several types of oxidative methods have been tried 
for the removal of phenols from solutions or wastewaters. Phenol degradation by a photo-Fenton reaction has been demonstrated in highly concentrated wastewaters and the intermediate species can be identiﬁ  ed by Fourier trans-
form infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with an attenuated total reﬂ  ection (ATR) 
device (Arana et al., 2001). A global mechanism for photo-Fenton degrada-tion of phenol has also been proposed. Phenol has been oxidized over CuO/Al
2O3 in supercritical water (Yu and Savage, 2000) and Pt xAg 1−xMnO 2/CeO 2
catalysts (Hamoudi et al., 2000). A heterogeneous copper catalyst supported 
o n  m e s o p o r o u s  M C M - 4 1  w i t h  a  p o r e  a r e a  o f  o v e r  1 4 0 0  m2/g showed high 
catalytic activity for the wet oxidation of phenol solution at a concentration of 1300 ppm at 150 and 200°C (Wu et al., 2001b). An advanced oxidation 
process (AOP) of ultraviolet light/hydrogen peroxide has been investigated for the degradation of phenolic compounds in a completely mixed batch photolytic reactor (Alnaizy and Akgerman, 2000). Three isomers of chloro-phenol were completely dechlorinated within 5 hours by palladium/iron powder in water through catalytic reduction (Liu et al., 2001). Bisphenol A can be oxidized electrochemically by voltammetric techniques (Kuramitz et al., 2001).
Phenol can be photo-degraded in aqueous solution by photocatalysis and 
direct photolysis (Chun et al., 2000). The two processes show different reac-tion pathways of phenol degradation. Photodegradation of phenol and 4-chlorophenol by BaO–Li
2O–TiO 2 c at a lyst s (L ey va et a l., 19 9 8 ) , photoox idat ion 
of 2,6-dimethylphenol and monophenylphenols in the presence of uranyl ion in water (Sarakha et al., 1997), and the role of metals in homogeneous photooxidation of phenols (Sykora et al., 1997) have been demonstrated. Photo-sonochemical degradation (Wu et al., 2001a) and photo-nitration of phenol (Vione et al., 2001a,b) in aqueous solution have also been evaluated. Jung et al. (1993) obtained a 30% increase in the degradation rate by applying a magnetic south pole to a bioreactor with immobilized microbial beads. Phenol has also been immobilized in cement-based solidiﬁ  ed/stabi-
lized hazardous wastes using regenerating activated carbon (Hebatpuria et al., 1999).
7.2.2 Biological Methods
7.2.2.1 Metabolism by Bacteria.  Some phenol-degrading microorganisms 
have been listed and kinetic models described by Vipulanandan et al. (1994). Pseudomonas  sp. D8 has the ability to degrade monochlorophenols, 
nitrophenols, and phenol (Chang et al., 1997). Resting cells of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP)-grown Pseudomonas cepacia  AC1100 converted 
dichlorophenols, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), and pentachlorophenol (PCP) to the corresponding chlorohydroquinones (Tomasi et al., 1995). Alca-
ligenes eutrophus  assimilated phenol as a sole source of carbon and 4-chlo-
rophenol as a cometabolite (Hill et al., 1996). Pseudomonas putida
cometabolized 4-chlorophenol in the presence of phenol at various concentra-tion ratios in an external-loop ﬂ  uidized-bed airlift bioreactor (EFBAB) (Loh 
and Ranganath, 2005). A. eutrophus  JMP134 degraded 2,4,6-TCP completely 
and 40% of 2,4,5-TCP (Clement et al., 1995). Bench-scale experiments have explored the feasibility of passive evaporation, soil washing, and biodegrada-tion for treatment of phenol and cresol in the soil (Evangelista et al., 1990). Biotreatment experiments have found A. eutrophus  JMP134 in soil. A full-
scale soil-leaching process removed more than 99.9% phenol and 99.7% cresols.
Phenol-induced cells of Acinetobacter species have been shown to degrade 
4- and 3-chlorophenols (4- and 3-CPs) (Kim and Hao, 1999). Streptomyces ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES 217218 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PHENOLS, CHLOROPHENOLS, AND PCP
rochei  303 assimilated a wider range of chlorinated phenols, such as dichloro-, 
tri-, tetra-, and pentachlorophenol, as the sole sources of carbon and energy (Golovleva et al., 1991–1992). S. rochei  303 showed the activity of hydroxy-
quinol 1,2-dioxygenase in cell-free extracts. Degradation of 2,4,5-TCP and 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol has been successful when efﬁ  cient pulse electric 
discharge has been followed by bioremediation with a bacterial consortium from acclimated return activated sludge (Tartakovsky et al., 2001). Immobi-lized cells of Pseudomonas putida  were shown able to degrade phenolic 
industrial wastewater in a ﬂ  uidized-bed reactor (Gonzalez et al., 2001). Four 
species of bacteria exhibited an ortho -cleavage pathway to metabolize chlo-
rophenols by immobilized cultures in a series of batch reactors (Lu et al., 1996). Three species effectively removed phenol at a concentration of 200 mg/l. Pseudomonas  removed phenol in a four-stage cross-ﬂ  ow rotating 
biological contactor (RBC) reactor (Banerjee, 1997). Chlorophenol was min-eralized 99% at loading rates of 1000 mg/l in high-rate ﬂ  uidized-bed bioﬁ  lm 
systems within less than an hour (Puhakka et al., 1995). Droste et al. (1998) showed the read removal of ortho -chlorine atoms and toxicity of para -
chlorine atoms in chlorinated phenols using upﬂ  ow-anaerobic sludge blanket 
(UASB) reactors.
7.2.2.2 Metabolism by Actinomycetes.  Strains of thermophilic/thermotol-
erant Saccharomonospora viridis  were shown to have the ability to remove 
PCP from liquid cultures within 8 days (Webb et al., 2001). The PCP removal depends on growth and requires de novo protein synthesis. The pathway proposed indicates oxidation of PCP to tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), which undergoes further oxidation to tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCBQ), and this forms polar conjugates to excrete into the growth medium. However, S. viride  is unable to mineralize PCP in experiments conducted with [
14C]PCP. 
Arthrobacter aurescens  TW17 degrades para -nitrophenol to hydroquinone 
and nitrite and Nocardia  sp. strain TW2 to hydroquinone or 4-nitrocatechol 
(Hanne et al., 1993).
7.2.2.3 Metabolism by Algae and Higher Plants.  An isolated unicellular 
microalga, VT1, reduced 70.3% PCP from media in the presence of light ( T ik o o  e t  al . ,  1 996 ).  Min e r aliz a t i o n  a p p e ar e d  t o  o cc ur  d u e  t o  e v o l u t i o n  o f  
14CO 2 from [14C]PCP by VT1. Ochromonas danica  degrades phenol and its 
methylated homologs and shows catabolic versatility to degrade mixtures of phenols (Semple and Cain, 1996, 1997). The ﬁ  rst meta -cleavage pathway for 
aromatic ring degradation in a eukarotic alga has been identiﬁ  ed. Nearly 22% 
of pentachlorophenol mineralized after 155 days when crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum ) was vegetated on contaminated soil (Ferro et al., 
1994). Glucose and glucuronic acids were produced by wheat ( Triticum aes-
tivum ) cells after 2 days upon exposure to 1 mg/l of 4- n-nonylphenol (Bokern 
and Harms, 1997).7.3 FUNGAL BIOSENSORS FOR DETERMINATION OF VARIOUS 
TYPES OF PHENOLS
Living organisms are used as biological indicators to examine the toxicity of 
chemical substances for the last four decades. Armillaria mellea  and Mycena 
citricolor  have been employed to develop a novel, bioluminescence-based 
toxicity bioassay of 3,5-dichlorophenol (3,5-DCP) and PCP within 60 minutes (Weitz et al., 2002). Light reduction was observed in response to 3,5-DCP and PCP for both fungi. The EC
50 values for both fungi were similar to the 
EC 50 values for 3,5-DCP and PCP of bioluminescence-based bacterial biosen-
sors. Different biosensor conﬁ  gurations, including enzyme electrodes, cata-
lytic cycles, and mechanisms for the determination of phenolic compounds, have been described (Marko- V arga et al., 1995). Nistor and Emneus (1999) described the biosensors for monitoring the polar organic pollutants, includ-ing the phenolic compounds, together with 200 references.
7.3.1 Enzyme-Based Systems
Several enzymes possess the ability to convert speciﬁ  c or less speciﬁ  c com-
pounds in the presence of oxygen or can generate other compounds. The extent of consumption or generation depends on the concentration of con-verted compound. Certain compounds can also act as inhibitors of activity of enzymes, and the extent of inhibition can be determined. These tools can be classiﬁ  ed into three types: type 1 for highly selective detection of speciﬁ  c 
target compounds, type 2 for screening purposes, and type 3 as a biomarker of toxicity and for global toxicity monitoring (Wollenberger et al., 1994). Fungal biosensors for the determination of various types of phenols are noted in Table 7.1.
Several strains of Trichosporon  yeasts have been utilized in biosensors for 
environmental purposes (Neujahr, 1984, 1990). Three different biosensors have been constructed based on the reduction of oxygen during phenol deg-radation by Trichosporon cutaneum  using platinum–silver Clark-type oxygen 
electrodes. Various tissues and cells rich in phenol oxidases, such as mush-room (Skladal, 1991; Canofeni et al., 1994) or laccase (Ghindilis et al., 1992), h a v e  b e e n  us e d  in  co m b in a ti o n  wi th  Cl ar k - typ e  o xy g e n  e l e ctr o d e .  Puriﬁ  ed 
(Kjellen and Neujahr, 1980) and immobilized (Kjellen and Neujahr, 1979) phenol hydroxylase electrodes have also been employed for the detection of phenol.
Co-immobilizing enzymes with different speciﬁ  cities for phenolic com-
pounds is another approach to improving the sensitivity of biosensors. Tyrosinase–peroxidase (Cosnier and Popescu, 1996) and tyrosinase–laccase (Y aropolov et al., 1995) biosensors have been discussed. Ultrasensitive bio-sensors have been developed by combining tyrosinase (Bier et al., 1996a) or laccase (Bier et al., 1996b) with either quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase FUNGAL BIOSENSORS FOR DETERMINATION OF VARIOUS TYPES 219TABLE 7.1 Fungal Biosensors for Determination of Phenols

The detection limit is 0.02 μM for both phenol and catechol. Peroxidase bio-
sensors can also be used for the determination of phenols (Ruzgas et al., 1995; Munteanu et al., 1998).
7.3.2 Biological Afﬁ  nity Assays (Immunoassays)
Biological afﬁ  nity assays were developed for medical purposes, but many of 
them are now being evaluated for possible use in environmental applications. These include batch immunoassays, immunobiosensors, and ﬂ  ow immunoas-
says. Most of them are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with either the antigen (Ag-indirect ELISA) or the antibody (Ab-direct ELISA) immobi-lized to either plates or particles. The presence of 1-naphthol can be detected in groundwater by use of ELISA type Ia (Marco et al., 1995). Direct Ab-ELISA type IIa has been developed for the determination of PCP (Gerlach and Van Emon, 1997).
7.4 METHODS OF ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF PHENOLS
The phenolic compounds can be separated and conﬁ  rmed by HPLC and TLC 
and by HPLC, gel permeation chromatography, and TLC-MS. The metabo-lites of 4-(1-nonyl)phenol are analyzed by TLC on silica gel plates with a ﬂ  uo-
rescent indicator (Vallini et al., 2001), and those of phenolic compounds by TLC, HPLC, and MS (Edlin et al., 1995). Phenolic compounds have been separated by HPLC with absorbance and ﬂ  uorimetric detectors in series 
(Rodriguez-Delgado et al., 2001). Eleven Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) priority phenols (POHs) have been separated and determined by reverse-phase capillary HPLC with indirect ﬂ  uorophotometric detection 
(Chung and Lee, 2001). The bioconversion of phenol and para -cresol has 
been measured by reverse-phase HPLC using software and a UV detector (Luke and Burton, 2001). Progress in the development of microchip capillary electrophoresis (CE) with electrochemical (EC) detection, and the advan-tages, have been described (Lacher et al., 2001). Candida nitrativorans
degraded radiolabeled phenol in internal and external collection systems in a study by Bastos et al. (1997). Use of an external collection system for radio-respirometric measurement of an aerobic process using a substrate has been recommended.
7.5 FUNGAL BIOREACTORS FOR REMOVAL OF VARIOUS 
TYPES OF PHENOLS
Recently, fungal bioreactors have been developed for the removal of phenols, 
chlorophenols, and PCP. These bioreactors are still in the developmental FUNGAL BIOREACTORS FOR REMOVAL OF VARIOUS TYPES 221222 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PHENOLS, CHLOROPHENOLS, AND PCP
phase, and thus scaling in the light of different optimum operating conditions 
is necessary. Logan et al. (1994) suggested some factors for the conceptual design of fungal PCP bioreactors: ( 1 ) long detention times of 1 0 to 40 da ys from inoculation to complete PCP removal, (2) study of chemical adsorption on a case-by-case basis, and (3) the insigniﬁ  c an ce  o f  a  s y s t e m  d e s i gn  wi t h  
nitrogen limitations in the bioreactor feed and the signiﬁ  cance of a system 
design to produce shallow ﬂ  uid interfaces.
Commercial applications of these bioreactors in the metabolism of phenols, 
chlorophenols, and PCP are unknown at this time. However, based on the limited research, fungal bioreactors (Table 7.2) are classiﬁ  ed into four types, 
described below.
7.5.1 Rotating Tube Bioreactors
A rotating tube bioreactor (RTB) has been developed to study degradation 
of PCP by ﬁ  xed ﬁ  lms of white-rot fungi (Alleman et al., 1995). Tubes were 
rotated to expose the mycelial bioﬁ  lm on the mesh to a wetting–aeration cycle 
characteristic of ﬁ  xed-ﬁ  lm reactors such as trickling ﬁ  lters and rotating bio-
logical contactors. All species of fungi grew well in the RTBs and showed thick bioﬁ  lm s ,  w hi c h  r e m ain e d  a t t a c h e d  t o  t h e  m e s h  d urin g  t u b e  r o t a t i o n .  
Trametes versicolor  sh o w ed th e high est de hal o g e na ti on (62% ), f o ll o w ed b y 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and Inonotus dryophilus , after 8 days. The 
total organic halide (TOX) concentrations decreased in the order I. dryophi-
lus (1.8 mg Cl/l), P. chrysosporium  (0.5 mg Cl/l), and T. versicolor  (0.3 mg 
Cl/l). About 33% of organically bound chlorine (OBX) was contained within the mycelia of T. versicolor , 55% of P. chrysosporium , and 52% of 
I. dryophilus .
7.5.2 Membrane Bioreactors
Membrane bioreactors designed for cell immobilization are now employed in 
the detoxiﬁ  cation of industrial phenolic wastewater. A novel polysulfone cap-
illary membrane bioreactor system with immobilized fungal bioﬁ  m of Neu-
rospora crassa  (Figure 7.1) was used to degrade phenol or para -cresol (Luke 
and Burton, 2001). A capillary bioreactor was operated in a dead-end con-ﬁ guration and showed a high percentage removal of phenol and para -cresol. 
Laccase production was sustained at a level of 10 U/ml of permeate (1080 U/g wet biomass) over 30 to 40 days. This was the ﬁ  rst report on the continuous 
production of laccase by N. crassa  grown in immobilized systems. The bio-
degradative capacity of the bioreactor was maintained continuously to sustain this removal efﬁ  ciency for 4 months.
7.5.3 Packed-Bed/Immobilized Bioreactors
The use of immobilized fungi has several advantages, such as prolonged reten-
tion of fungal cells or enzymes with minimal washout even at high dilution TABLE 7.2 Fungal Bioreactors for Removal of Phenols, Chlorophenols, and Pentachlorophenol

rates. Most of the reactors discussed earlier suffer limitations in maintaining 
a consistent high level of enzyme activity, steady-state continuous enzyme production and fungal activities for prolonged periods, and controlled fungal growth. A major problem lies in the lack of a suitable bioreactor system and immobilization technology. However, several studies of reactor systems involving white-rot fungi have been described (Shim and Kawamoto, 2002). Phenol can be degraded long term by Trichosporon cutaneum  R57 covalently 
immobilized to polyamide granules with a high surface area (Godjevargova et al., 1998). Covalently bound cells degrade phenol at concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 g/l in less time (24 hours) than do free cells (27 hours). Phenol is fully degraded in 27 hours for the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve cycles and in 36 hours for the next four 
cycles (from sixth to ninth), and degradation decreases to 80% during the tenth cycle. T. cutaneum  cells bound to cellulose granules have the capacity 
to degrade furfurol (Ivanova and Yotova, 1993).
The packed-bed reactor system depicted in Figure 7.2 has been employed 
for the degradation of PCP by two wild-type strains of Phanerochaete chryso-
sporium  (Shim and Kawamoto, 2002). Of ﬁ  ve biocarriers, the polyurethane 
foam produced the highest biomass. Biostage and Biolace show similar high levels of growth and adhesion. The Biostage carrier produced the highest LiP activity of 22.6 U/ml on day 11 with an average LiP activity of 12 U/ml and an average MnP activity of 4.9 U/ml through 7 to 21 days. Steady-state con-tinuous degradation of PCP over an extended period reached a degradation ratio exceeding 80%. The major metabolites were identiﬁ  ed as 2,4,6-TCP and 
2,3,4,6-TCP in a Biostage packed-bed reactor after 12 days. Polyurethane foam and polyethylene were used as carriers for the immobilization of P. 
chrysosporium  in static and agitated cultures for 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) deg-
radation (Zouari et al., 2002). These carriers allowed total 4-CP disappear-ance within 4 and 6 days for the ﬁ  rst and second batches and 90% for the 
third batch within 12 days. Immobilization on polyethylene disks in RBC depletes total 2-CP within 2 days. Degradation of 4-CP occurred in the pres-ence of a high-glycerol and high-glutamate medium which is known to

7.5.4 Upﬂ  ow Column Bioreactors
A bench-scale upﬂ  ow tubular column reactor removed 77% PCP from adsorb-
able organic halogen (AOX) by Penicillum camemberti  (Taseli and Gokcay, 
2005). In addition to the column, the reactor consisted of a feed tank, a feed pump, an inlet, an outlet, and four sampling outlets. The constant hydraulic loading rate of the feed solution is 2.12 l/l per day. The reactor is operated without aeration and a minimum amount of carbon supplement.P

7.5.5 Miscellaneous Bioreactors
A wide variety of composting systems are well established, including circular 
tanks, in-ground trenches, open bins, rotating drums, windrows and open piles, and silos. Most composting systems utilize bulking agents, such as bark chips, straw, and chopped sugar beet, that augment the porosity and oxygen content in the medium and reduce the moisture levels. Despite limitations, composting has proven advantages. The fate of organic pollutants in soil-composting/compost systems has been discussed (Semple et al., 2001). All composting systems showed about 50 to 60% mineralization of [UL-
14C]PCP 
after 30 days (Laine and Jorgensen, 1997). Windrow systems were also employed for pilot-scale composting of 44 mg/kg chlorophenol-contaminated soils using different inoculants. Nearly 80% of chlorophenols was eliminated after 2 months. At this stage, highly contaminated soils of 683 to 1108 mg/kg were added to the composting windrows. Finally, more than 90% of chloro-phenols were eliminated after 3 months.
7.6 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PHENOLS, CHLOROPHENOLS, 
AND PENTACHLOROPHENOL
Research on fungal degradation of different groups of phenols is well estab-
lished during the last three decades. However, it is important to ﬁ  nd methods 
for the selection and isolation of phenol-degrading fungi. Bastos et al. (1996) stated a method for microbial selection based on adaptation to phenol and isolation of microorganisms to utilize phenol as a sole source of carbon. Labeled phenol (
14C) can also be used to determine the relative degradative 
capacities of microbial communities and isolates. Moreover, phenol-degrading microorganisms can be employed exogenously in chemically stressed habitats. Fungal degradation of phenols, chlorophenols, and penta-chlorophenol is noted in Table 7.3.
7.6.1 Fungal Metabolism of Phenols
In general, phenols are metabolized to catechol by bacteria and fungi, and 
catechol leads to further degradation. Based on the growth of 88 Micromy-cetes belonging to different taxonomic groups, Rahouti et al. (1995) reported the best fungal degradation of compounds devoid of a carboxyl group and did not correlate with phenol oxidase activity. Several species and strains of Micromycetes provided the highest growth on protocatechuic and vanillic acids as the sole sources of carbon (Rahouti et al., 1999). Nearly 74% strains showed good or medium growth. Syringic and ferulic acids provided good growth, 65% and 62% of strains, respectively, followed by poor growth on catechol (52%) and guaiacol (45%) and low growth on phenol (37%). Pheno-lic compounds with —OH or —COOH substituents were easier to metabolize TABLE 7.3 Fungal Metabolism of Phenols, Chlorophenols, and Pentachlorophenol

228than those with —OCH3 substituents. Two species ( Paecilomyces variotii  and 
Pestalotia palmarum ) among 1044 Micromycetes exhibited weak and strong 
phenol oxidase activity, respectively. Three species of Coprinus  metabolized 
most phenolic compounds efﬁ  c i e n t l y ,  e x c e p t  s y r i n g i c  a c i d  ( G u i r a u d  e t  a l . ,  
1999). C. cinereus  produced peroxidases, and C. micaceus  mostly laccases. 
The phenol oxidase activity was very strong in C. micaceus , followed by 
C. cinereus  a n d  n o  r e s p o n s e  i n  Coprinus  sp. PCP was nonassimilated by 
Coprinus  sp. because of strong adsorption on mycelial biomass. Laccases and 
peroxidases from Coprinus  species were not necessary for the degradation of 
these compounds. However, the puriﬁ  ed peroxidase from Coprinus  was 
involved in the metabolism of ferulic acid (Abelskow et al., 1997) and guaiacol (Morita et al., 1988).
Only 61 strains of 809 grow well in solid media, and these belong to the 
genera Penicillium ,Fusarium ,Mucor ,Absidia , and Epicoccum  (Krivobok 
et al., 1994). Phanerochaete chrysosporium  depleted 90% of phenol at a high 
concentration at 37°C after 5 days. The ﬁ  rst step was 2-hydroxylation of 
phenol to catechol after 1 day, followed by ortho -ﬁ ssion of the aromatic ring 
to produce muconic acid after 3 days that further oxidized to β-keto-adipate 
after 5 days. These metabolites were also quantiﬁ  ed. FIB4, LEA5, and AE2 
strains of Graphium  sp. and FE11 of Fusarium  sp. showed high rates of 
phenol degradation (Santos and Linardi, 2004). All strains secreted catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and phenol hydroxylase, suggesting the oxidation of catechol by ortho -type ring ﬁ  ssion. Cain (1980) discussed the ortho -ﬁ ssion of aromat-
ics in fungi. Degradation of para -cresol up to 150 mg/l was found in the 
presence of glucose and nitrogen-limited conditions using Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  BKM-F-1767 (Kennes and Lema, 1994). Two uptake systems 
were identiﬁ  ed for phenol in glycerol-grown Trichosporon cutaneum
(Mortberg et al., 1988). The ﬁ  rst was an inducible, high-afﬁ  nity system that

nonsensitive to protonophores. Phenol was also used as a sole carbon source and oxidized to catechol by T. cutaneum  (Spanning and Neujahr, 1990). The 
soil-borne yeast Candida maltosa  utilized phenol and catechol as the sole 
sources of carbon and energy at concentrations up to 1.7 g/l and 1.5 g/l, respec-t i v e l y  ( F i a l o v a  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 4 ) .  A n  A q u a l y t i c  S e n s o m a t  S y s t e m  u s i n g  B O D  measurements was used to rapidly monitor the biodegradation. Phenol hydroxylase activity reached a maximum value during the complete degrada-tion of phenol. The yeast also metabolized para -cresol. Phenol was also 
assimilated by hydrocarbon-utilizing yeasts (Hofmann and Schauer, 1988). M i d d e l h o v e n  e t  a l .

aurantiaca  G36. The growth of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous yeasts 
and yeastlike fungi on benzene compounds and the catabolic pathways has also been reviewed (Middelhoven, 1993).
7.6.2 Fungal Metabolism of Chlorophenols
Complete degradation of meta - and para -chlorophenol by Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  was shown to occur after 15 days (Perez et al., 1997). The 
degradation ability of P. chrysosporium  depends on the position of substitu-
ent chlorine, and the ortho -position is the preferred attack position. The 
acclimated mycelium enhances the degradation rates of chlorophenols as well as more or less increasingly similar for three isomers, and the preference for ortho -position attack is reduced. P. chrysosporium  degraded 2,6-dichloro-
phenol (2,6-DCP) at the same rate in N-limited and N-sufﬁ  cient media (Wu 
et al., 1996). 2,6-DCP disappeared within 3 days in zero-order reaction rates. Biodegradation causes about 80% removal of 2,6-DCP, excluding bioadsorp-tion and volatilization. No clear relationship exists between the ligninolytic enzymes and biodegradation of 2,6-DCP. Both LiP and MnP are detected in N-sufﬁ  cient media and MnP only in N-limited medium. Of four species, 
Pleurotus sajor-caju  showed the highest 2,4-DCP mineralization rate of 2% 
a f t e r  1 5  d a y s  ( R o d r i g u e z  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 4 ) .  C a t e c h o l  a n d  m u c o n o l a c t o n e  w e r e  identiﬁ  ed during complete assimilation of phenol by Rhodotorula glutinis
(Katayama-Hirayama et al., 1994). The formation of muconolactone suggests ortho -ﬁ ssion of the ring as the preferable mechanism. 3-Chlorophenol (3-CP) 
and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) are also well degraded with the stoichiometric release of chloride ions, followed by low degradation of 2-chlorophenol with a small release of chloride ions. Phenol or CP(s) act as inducers for the metabolism of 3-CP and 4-CP. GC/MS analysis revealed 4-chlorocatechol and maleylacetic acid as metabolites of 3-CP and 4-CP, and dechlorination may occur between the formation of 4-chlorocatechol and maleylacetic acid.
Fungi are also known to metabolize trichlorophenols (Seeholzer-Nguyen 
and Hock, 1991). GC analysis demonstrated a reduction of 25% of 2,4,5-TCP or 2,4,6-TCP within 4 to 5 days of inoculation by Pleurotus cornucopiae . In 
experiments with [
14C]-2,4,5-TCP, only 56% radioactivity was recovered after 
6 days; what remained mineralized to CO 2. This suggests the degradation of 
trichlorophenols under conditions that are not nitrogen-limited. Such condi-tions favor the production of aryl-alcohol oxidase as well as the degradation of 2,4,5-TCP by other species of Pleurotus , such as P. ostreatus ﬂ  orida  and 
P. eryngii .
7.6.3 Fungal Metabolism of Pentachlorophenol
Two new local strains of white-rot fungi have a good appetite for PCP in 
growth medium (Tayal et al., 1999). HPLC analysis indicated PCP removal of 38.8% and 18.8% by strains Wd1 and I6, respectively, after 15 days. The 
biodegradation rate was higher in the initial phase and followed pseudo-ﬁ  rst-
order kinetics. Degradation of PCP was enhanced in the presence of Mn(II), H
2O2, and glucose in the medium by strain Wd1. Strain Wd1 showed a 
maximum of 68% degradation in 16 days. This strongly suggests the involve-ment of peroxidase enzymatic system in the biodegradation of PCP .
A rapid disappearance of PCP from the medium by Oidiodendron echi-
nulatum  and Calcarisporium arbuscula  after 5 days suggests strong adsorp-
tion on the mycelia (Seigle-Murandi et al., 1995). Logan et al. (1994) showed the extent of adsorption as a function of fungal species and PCP concentra-tion. Degradation of PCP by Micromycetes (Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, yeasts, and Zygomycetes) has been examined (Seigle-Murandi et al., 1992, 1993; Steiman et al., 1994). Ascomycetes show heterogeneous results as the disappearance of PCP occurs both in phenol oxidase-producing and oxidase-nonproducing strains. Basidiomycetes deplete PCP moderately, irrespective of high producers of phenol oxidases. Poor degradation occurs in yeasts and phenol oxidases are not produced. Absidia  and Cunninghamella  are the most 
effective genera among 70 strains of Zygomycetes. No correlation exists between the production of phenol oxidases and PCP depletion among genera in all classes of Micromycetes. Mycelia of fungi such as Armillaria ,Gano-
derma ,Pleurotus ,Polyporus ,Coprinus , and Volvariella  were shown to have 
the ability to remove PCP in a batch cultivation system (Chiu et al., 1998). Polyporus  mycelia exhibited the best PCP-absorbing capacity (31 g/kg), and 
Armillaria  revealed the highest capacity (13 g/kg) to break down the 
compound.
7.7 FACTORS AFFECTING FUNGAL METABOLISM OF 
VARIOUS TYPES OF PHENOLS
The acceleration and effectiveness of phenol metabolism depend on the 
dynamics of the physicochemical factors of the medium or in the ﬁ  eld. These 
factors include temperature, pH, aeration, type of agitation, type of inoculum, and carbon and nitrogen sources. The optimum requirement of these inter-dependent factors is important for the intensity of the detoxiﬁ  cation process. 
The concentration and structure of the toxic substrates also affect the biodeg-radation activity. Various factors known to inﬂ  uence the effectiveness of 
phenol biodegradation are noted in Table 7.4.
7.7.1 Effect of Static Versus Agitated Culture Conditions
Both static and shaking cultures of Neurospora crassa  are effective for the 
removal of para -cresol over a wide concentration range (Luke and Burton, 
2001). Extracellular laccase activity was 10 to 12 U/ml in static and 1.5 U/ml in shaken cultures, respectively, over 8 to 15 days.

produced as an intracellular enzyme at 374 U/g wet mass. Under static condi-
tions, 85 to 100% PCP was reduced with 10 to 50% recovery of 14CO 2 (Mileski 
et al., 1988). Magnetic stirring and orbital shaking inﬂ  uenced the depletion 
of PCP using 12 strains of Deuteromycetes (Seigle-Murandi et al., 1995). Half of the strains favored the depletion of PCP by an orbital type of agitation. Mycelia age and agitation speed affected PCP degradation in submerged cultures by Rhizopus nigricans  (Cortes et al., 2001). A degradation efﬁ  ciency 
of 0.028 mg PCP/mg biomass per hour was obtained under these conditions. The depth of ﬂ  uid media also plays an important role in pollutant degradation 
by fungi (Logan et al., 1994). Of four species of fungi,  Inonotus rickii  exhibits 
nearly complete PCP removal after 6 days when grown in deep 50-ml suspen-sions in 250-ml ﬂ  asks compared to PCP removal after 10 days when grown 
in shallow 10-ml suspensions. This indicates the importance of the ratio of surface area to volume of liquid media (oxygen transfer) in the extent of PCP removal by white-rot fungi.
7.7.2 Effect of Culture Age, Type of Inoculum, and Carbon and 
Nitrogen Sources
Glucose concentration (5 to 10 g/l) and type of inoculum (spores or mycelium 
plus spores) inﬂ  uence the depletion of PCP using 12 strains of Deuteromyce-
tes (Seigle-Murandi et al., 1995). Glucose concentration of 5 g/l supported the best depletion of PCP. Spores of half of the strains did not develop a mycelial mat in 48 hours of cultivation to circum v en t the to xic eff ect of PCP . These ﬁ ndings were also reported by Mileski et al. (1988). Better PCP depletion 
occurred in mycelia plus spores type of inoculums. Light (4800 lux, 12 hours per day) supported better depletion of PCP (22%) by Phoma glomerata  after 
24 hours than did dark.
The exposure time has been studied in relation to PCP, culture age, and 
C/N ratio in culture media by white-rot fungi (Logan et al., 1994). In most species, the rate of PCP removal decreases with time. The PCP (80%) deg-radation increased with culture age (60 to 70 hours) in N-deﬁ  cient media, 
suggesting the potential removal of PCP by older cultures. The production time, concentration, and types of ligninolytic enzymes in Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  depend on the age of the culture (Leisola et al., 1987). So it 
is important to employ cultures of different growth stages and ages to maxi-mize pollutant degradation and removal. Nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient 20-day-old cul-
tures dehalogenated slightly greater removal of PCP than did nitrogen-deﬁ  cient 
cultures (Alleman et al., 1995). Recovery of chloride in nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient 
and nitrogen-deﬁ  cient cultures, respectively, were P. chrysosporium , 0.65 and 
1.5 mg/l, I. dryophilus , 0.2 and 0.9 mg/l, and T. versicolor , 2.5 and 2.8 mg/l.
P. chrysosporium  grown in either a 2% ammonium lignosulfonate (LS) 
(nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient) medium or a 0.23% LS and 2% glucose (nitrogen-
deﬁ cient) medium eliminated 72 to 75% of PCP after 3 days (Aiken and Logan, 
1996). Dehalogenation of PCP took place despite inhibition of LiP activity by LS. Only 1.85% of initial PCP recovered as PCP after 13 days. The remainder 
of PCP either mineralized or converted to intermediates in the form of organic halides. About 58% of original chlorine was recovered as organic, non-PCP halide, 73% of which was associated with cell mass. Of the remaining chlorine, 40% was released as chloride ion. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations inﬂ  u-
enced chlorophenol degradation by acclimated mycelium of P. chrysosporium
(Perez et al., 1997). Complete degradation of different isomers of chlorophe-n o l s  o c c u r r e d  i n  N - d e ﬁ  cient static cultures in the presence of glucose and 
ammonium tartrate. The chlorophenol degradation rate decreases when ammonium tartrate was replaced by ammonium chloride.
7.8 PHYSIOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS OF FUNGI BY PHENOLS
Certain physiological alterations by phenolic substrates are found in certain 
Micromycetes, such as changes in fructiﬁ  cation and abnormal production of 
pigments or viscous substances (Rahouti et al., 1999). Nearly 50 to 68% of these fungi produced normal fructiﬁ  cations on catechol, protocatechuic, 
vanillic, ferulic, and syringic acids. The lowest number of fungi was associated with phenol (29%) and guaiacol (40%), respectively. Catechol, guaiacol, and syringic acid induced the strongest pigments. Pigment formation was infre-quent with ferulic, vanillic, and protocatechuic acids. Sporormiella antarctica
and Heterobasidion annosum  produced abnormal pigments on phenol. 
Pigment formation was related to the action of phenol oxidases, which polym-erize phenols or form quinones. In disubstituted phenols, pigment production w a s  h i g h e r  w i t h  a  m e t h o x y l a t e d  c o m p o u n d  s u c h  a s  g u a i a c o l  t h a n  w i t h  catechol.
Among para -hydroxybenzoic acids, dimethoxylated syringic acid supports 
higher pigment production than monomethoxylated vanillic acid and nonme-thoxylated protocatechuic acid (Rahouti et al., 1999). About 4.4% of strains secrete viscous substances in the presence of protocatechuic acid. A few strains produce viscous substances in the presence of guaiacol, ferulic, or syringic acids. The signiﬁ  cance of production of viscous substances is still 
unknown. Nearly 8.6% of the strains have been shown to undergo morpho-logical abnormalities, especially among the genera Alternaria ,Cylindrocar-
pon, and Fusarium  (Krivobok et al., 1994). Only 0.5% of the strains of the 
genus Aspergillus was discolored or produced a pigment. None of the fructi-
ﬁ cation occurred in the presence of phenol among the Zygomycetes, which 
normally demonstrate sexual reproduction. Furthermore, the fructiﬁ  cations 
were more sensitive than the mitotic spores. An inhibitory effect appeared during the formation of fructiﬁ  cation in species of Pleurotus  by incorporation 
of phenol (0.1 to 1.0 mM) in malt extract agar medium (Upadhyay and Hofrichter, 1993). Soaking wheat straw up to 1600 mg/l showed better myce-lial growth and fructiﬁ  cation of Pleurotus cornucopiae ,P. ostreatus  Z-15, and 
Calocybe indica  than those of water-soaked wheat straw.PHYSIOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS OF FUNGI BY PHENOLS 235236 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PHENOLS, CHLOROPHENOLS, AND PCP
7.9 TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIP OF PHENOL-UTILIZING 
YEASTS AND FUNGI
The distribution of 1044 strains and species of fungi was shown to be deter-
mined by their good or medium growth on seven phenolic compounds (Rahouti et al., 1999). The highest percentage of these fungi is classiﬁ  ed 
among Melanconiales, Mucedinaceae, Tuberculariales, and Sphaeropsidales of Fungi Imperfecti. Melanconiales and Ascomycetes show better growth on phenolic acids than on other phenols. Tuberculariales perform well on all phenolics, especially on phenolic acids. A few yeasts grow on phenolic com-pounds. The taxonomic relevance among heterobasidiomycetous yeasts has been correlated based on the capacity to assimilate 20 low-molecular-weight aromatic compounds by 332 strains representing about 200 species (Sampaio, 1999). Protocatechuic, caffeic, and para -hydroxybenzoic acids were mostly 
assimilated, whereas cinnamic, sinapic, and syringic aids and guaiacol were never utilized. Among the Urediniomycetes, the members of the Sporidiales and Naohidea-Rhodotorula minuta clade display a good ability to assimilate aromatic compounds, whereas the members of the Agaricostilbum-Kondoa group are more heterogeneous, showing similarity with the four subclades known. Among the Tremellomycetidae, the members of the Cystoﬁ  lobasid-
ium and Tremella clades exhibit less or no ability to utilize aromatic com-pounds. On the contrary, the members of the Trichosporon clade utilize phenol and similar substrates, and those of Filobasidium clade assimilate various aromatic compounds, including those requiring more complex cata-bolic routes.
Various taxonomic groups of 809 strains of Micromycetes were shown to 
be subject to response to consumption of phenol (Krivobok et al., 1994). Five groups of activity were classiﬁ  ed based on the criteria of growth. The most 
efﬁ cient strains belonged to the Zygomycetes, followed by Basidiomycetes, 
Ascomycetes, Coelomycetes, and Tuberculariales. Taxonomically, Mucedina-ceae (genus Penicillium ) assimilated phenol highly, followed by Tuberculari-
ales and Zygomycetes. Penicillium  and Fusarium  performed the best and 
better, respectively, while the Aspergilli  behaved poorly, as did the other 
Mucedinaceae. On the contrary, the yeasts (90%), Mucedinaceae (69%), excluding Aspergillus  and Penicillium , and Dematiaceae (66%), were the 
least efﬁ  cient for phenol.
During screening of 784 strains of Deuteromycetes, ﬁ  ve classes of activity 
were divided into different taxonomic groups based on PCP depletion: 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, and more than 80% (Seigle-Murandi et al., 1995). The efﬁ cient strains showed high heterogeneity, depending on the groups and 
genera. Among the most efﬁ  cient fungi, 168 revealed 70% PCP depletion and 
48 showed 80% (Mucedinaceae, 23; Dematiaceae, 14; Sphaeropsidales, 2; Tuberculariales, 1). Aspergillus  and Penicillium  w e r e  t h e  m o s t  a c t i v e  a n d  
were considered separately from other Mucedinaceae, due to the production of higher levels of phenol oxidase than others. Ellis (1971) classiﬁ  ed Aspergil-lus niger  with Dematiaceae, but high levels of phenol oxidase production did 
not ﬁ  t in this group. The same confusing observation was made for Ascomy-
cetes. Yeasts showed no appetite for PCP and their inability to produce phenol oxidase, whereas Basidiomycetes depleted PCP moderately along with a high production of phenol oxidase (Steiman et al., 1994). However, Zygo-mycetes showed the homogeneous behavior of extensive depletion of PCP without any phenol oxidase activity (Seigle-Murandi et al., 1992). Spores of strains of the same taxonomic group exhibited a difference in unknown PCP sensitivity.
It is almost impossible to classify genera or species of yeasts and fungi on 
the basis of the extent of degradation or degradation capacities. However, the elucidation of metabolic pathways, secretion of enzymes, and genetic studies may provide good insight into the taxonomic relationship of phenol-utilizing yeasts and fungi in the future.
7.10 MECHANISMS OF METABOLISM, METABOLIC PATHWAYS, 
AND METABOLITES
Aerobic degradation of phenol by bacteria has been examined since the 
beginning of the twentieth century. Several aerobic phenol-degrading bacte-ria have been isolated, and pathways for the degradation of phenol were initi-ated in 1950 and have now been well described. Van Schie and Young (2000) described the aerobic pathways, and phenol hydroxylase enzymes and their genetic analysis, anaerobic biodegradation, and phenol carboxylation under denitrifying and methanogenic conditions in bacteria.
The biodegradation of phenol by fungi started in 1960s, and the pathways 
began to be clariﬁ  ed in the 1970s. However, most of the work on the pathways 
of degradation of phenol and its derivatives has focused on yeasts, species of Aspergillus  and Penicillium , and white-rot fungi. This includes the involve-
ment of oxygen and cleavage of the benzene nucleus. The metabolism of phenol and its derivatives by yeasts (Neujahr, 1990) and of phenols, chloro-phenols, and PCP by fungi (Kremer and Anke, 1997) has been described. Table 7.5 lists rates of degradation or mineralization, metabolic products, and pathways of various phenolics, chlorophenols, and pentachlorophenol by fungi.
Scedosporium apiospermum , a hyphomycete isolated from the soil, effec-
tively degraded both phenol and para -cresol as the sole sources of carbon and 
energy at pH 7.3 and 37°C (Clau βen and Schmidt, 1998). All ortho -type ring-
cleaving dioxygenases were detected. The catabolism of para -cresol followed 
a single pathway to yield 3-oxoadipate, and the entire catabolism of phenol followed two different enzymatic sequences. Two possible routes in the catab-olism of phenol by S. apiospermum  are outlined in Figure 7.3. Enzyme activi-
ties and the corresponding metabolites of two different catabolic routes have been detected. In one pathway, the catabolism of phenol is followed by METABOLISM, METABOLIC PATHWAYS, AND METABOLITES 237TABLE 7.5 Fungal Metabolism of Phenols and Metabolic Products

benzoate hydrolyzes in mineral salts medium to yield phenol and benzoate by inducible esterase using Scedosporium apiospermum  (Claußen and 
Schmidt, 1999). Enzymes are induced for both the catabolism of benzoate via the protocatechuate ortho -pathway and the degradation of phenol via 3-
oxoadipate. Phenol is catabolized via the known routes of catechol and hydro-quinone, and benzoate is degraded via the protocatechuate branch of the ortho -pathway. Evidence of the operative gentisate pathway exists for the 
degradation of some phenols and hydroxybenzoates by the Imperfect ascomycetous yeasts Candida parapsilosis  and Arxula adeninivorans 
(Middelhoven et al., 1992b). 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid degrades via protocate-chuate. No cleavage enzyme has been detected, but the NADH- and NADPH-dependent monooxygenases are present. A. adeninivorans  shows 
glutathione-dependent isomerization of maleylpyruvate to fumarylpyruvate in the metabolism of 3-hydroxybenzoate.

Metabolism of phenol occurs via two possible routes, leading to different ring 
ﬁ ssion substrates (Figure 7.4). In one route, phenol hydroxylates at the ortho -
position to produce catechol, which is cleaved to 3-oxoadipate by an intradiol mechanism. In another route, phenol hydroxylates at the para -position to 
form hydroquinone, which is converted to 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene and sub-sequently, a ring is cleaved to produce maleylacetate. The same fungal strain also assimilates 4-ethylphenol (Jones et al., 1994) and para -cresol (Jones 
et al., 1993) as the sole carbon sources. A pathway has also been proposed for the metabolism of 4-ethylphenol by A. fumigatus . The metabolism of 4-
ethylphenol by A. fumigatus  follows a common sequence of metabolites to 
hydroquinone established for Pseudomonas putida  JD1 (Darby et al., 1987). 
However, during the initial step, the bacterium uses a ﬂ  avocytochrome c
dehydrogenase–hydratase and the fungus a monooxygenase. Jones et al. (1993) also demonstrated the conversion of para -cresol into protocatechuate 
by two routes using A. fumigatus , and the difference is in the sequence of 
reactions. Penicillium simplicissimum  SK9117 can utilize phenol and ﬂ  uori-
nated phenols as the sole sources of carbon and energy (Marr et al., 1996). The metabolism of all monoﬂ  uorophenols is enhanced in the presence of 
phenol, resulting in the simultanous disappearance of substrate and cosub-strate. The equimolar release of chloride ions indicates complete mineraliza-tion of 3- and 4-ﬂ  uorophenols. Based on the metabolites identiﬁ  ed, a pathway 
is proposed for the metabolism of monochlorophenols. Resting phenol-grown mycelia of Penicillium frequentans  Bi 7/2 were shown to degrade the mono-
chlorinated phenols, 3,4-dichlorophenol, and some other halogenated phenols completely within different time intervals (Hofrichter et al., 1994). Pathways for the degradation of monochlorinated derivatives by P. frequentans  Bi 7/2 
were proposed.OHOCOO-COO-SUCCINATE

right © with permission from Springer Science and Business Media and the

phenone (4-acetylphenol), were identiﬁ  ed during the metabolism of 4-
(1-nonyl)phenol ( pNP) by Candida aquaetextoris (Vallini et al., 2001). 
4-Acetylphenol accumulated in the culture without further degradation. H o w e v e r ,  t r a c e s  o f  a n  u n i d e n t i ﬁ  ed para -substituted phenol were detected. 
Good growth of C. aquaetextoris  on 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid also 
produced both trans -4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 4-hydroxyacetophenone. 
Poor growth and no evidence of growth were obtained on trans -4-hydroxycin-
namic acid and 4-hydroxyacetophenone, respectively. Biodegradation of pNP 
occurred via terminal oxidation of the alkyl chain, followed by a β-oxidation 
pathway. A novel metabolic route for the degradation of pNP in certain yeasts 
has also been proposed. Corti et al. (1995) identiﬁ  ed 4-hydroxyacetophenone 
as one of the metabolites from pNP by a strain of Candida  yeast that was later 
classiﬁ  ed as C. aquaetextoris  (Vallini et al., 1997).
4-Hydroxycinnamic acids are carboxylated and subsequently reduced to 
their 4-vinyl and 4-ethyl derivatives by the yeasts Brettanomyces intermedius
and B. anomalus  (Heresztyn, 1986; Lauritsen et al., 1991; Chattonet et al., 
1992). Brettanomyces anomalus  NCYC 615 transforms para -coumaric acid, 
caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and vanillin to yield two major products due to C2 cleavage (Edlin et al., 1995). B. intermedius  also has the ability to metabolize 
para -coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids in a similar way in unshaken ﬂ  asks 
(Heresztyn, 1986). Sinapic acid is not metabolized by B. anomalus . Two 
enzymes catalyze the metabolism of 4-hydroxycinnamic acids by Brettano-
myces  yeasts (Figure 7.5). Cinnamic decarboxylase is the ﬁ  rst enzyme respon-
sible for the cleavage of C3 carbon from the side chain, releasing CO
2. Vinyl 
phenol reductase is the second enzyme that reduces the double bond on the vinyl derivative to form ethyl-substituted compounds. The differences in the speciﬁ  city of cinnamic hydroxylase result in metabolic differences of hydroxy-
cinnamic acids by two species of yeasts. B. anomalus  transforms vanillin to 
vanillyl alcohol and vanillic acid (Figure 7.6). De Wulf et al. (1986) reported similar results in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These reactions involve oxido-
reductase enzymes and require an electron donor–acceptor such as

nicotinamide or ﬂ  avin adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide or ﬂ  avin adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NAD/NADH) or (FAD/FADH). Transformation of para -coumaric acid by Curvularia lunata  showed the formation of several 
intermediates (Torres and Rosazza, 2001). However, the presence of per-oxidase and laccase activities indicated the involvement in one-electron dimerization.
The formation of only the metabolite 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone (2-CIBQ)

cultures, fungal mycelia, and cell-free crude culture liquids (Grey et al., 1998). The production of 2-CIBQ is correlated with the extracellular laccase activity in cell-free crude culture liquids. On the contrary, the disappearance of 2-CP by the whole fungus does not correlate with extracellular laccase activity. The extracellular laccase can be partially responsible for the oxida-tive step, indicating involvement of a cell-bound process. Minard et al. (1981) also reported the formation of 2-CIBQ during the oxidation of 2-dichlorophenol by laccase from Rhizoctonia praticola  and by LiP and MnP 
that catalyze one-electron abstractions from phenolic compounds. Valli and Gold (1991) also detected 2-CIBQ during the degradation of 2-dichlorophe-nol by Phanerochaete chrysosporium . Methylation and hydroxylation reac-
tions are involved in the degradation of 3,4-dichlorophenol (3,4-DCP) by P. chrysosporium , followed by the formation of three metabolites (Deschler 
et al., 1998). Phenolics and benzoic acid derivatives are utilized as the s o l e  s o ur ce s  o f  car b o n  b y  fun gi  s u c h  as  Chaetomium cupreum ,Drechslera

Mahadevan, 1989). The central metabolites isolated by replacement culture are catechol, protocatechuic acid, hydroxyquinol, gentisic acid, and homo-gentisic acid. The fungi exhibit catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase, gentisate oxygenase, and homogentisate oxygenase during growth on these aromatics. Pathways for the degradation of these aromatics have been proposed. The 3-oxoadipate pathway of catechol and protocatechuate and ring ﬁ  ssion of 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene 
in fungi have also been proposed (Cain, 1987). Neujahr (1990) described the role of oxygen in the degradation of phenolic compounds, general pathways COOH

7.11 DEGRADATION OF PHENOLS BY FUNGAL ENZYMES
Most phenols are toxic and produce coloration to receiving waters and thus 
must be removed. Conventional methods of dephenolization of wastewaters have certain drawbacks, such as high cost, incomplete puriﬁ  cation, or 
restricted applicability. Biological methods are of interest due to low cost and the low adverse effect on the environment. Due to their biocide nature, most phenols cannot be degraded in conventional biological wastewater treatment, and the presence of high concentration of phenols may spoil the live micro-organisms in the system.
Enzyme treatment opens up a new approach for the treatment of waste-
waters containing hazardous phenolic compounds. The use of enzymes allows the process of degradation under mild biological conditions. Phenols can be oxidized by certain enzymes employing either hydrogen peroxide or molecu-lar oxygen–producing phenoxy radicals that react by themselves or with other phenols to form dimers. These reactions lead to the formation of precipitates of higher oligomers and polymers of low solubility and can be removed easily by sedimentation or ﬁ  ltration. There are some potential advantages of enzy-
matic treatment compared to conventional treatment (Nicell et al., 1993): applicability at high and low contaminant concentrations over a wide range of pH, temperature, and salinity; applicability to biorefractory compounds; unamenability to loading effects; no acclimatization of biomass; and reduc-tion in sludge volume and ease of controlling the process.
The free or immobilized preparation of enzymes can be applied to degrade 
or remove compounds that are unable to be treated by whole cell systems. The use of peroxidase, tyrosinase, or laccase enzymes in the detoxiﬁ  cation of 
phenols and aromatic amines from drinking water and wastewater was started in 1980s, and our knowledge is still far from complete. In recent years, con-siderable attention has been given to immobilized enzymes, which act as biocatalysts in the degradation of toxic organic compounds. The use of soluble enzyme is impractical due to the requirement for a large quantity and harsh denaturing conditions in the system. Such drawbacks can be eliminated by immobilizing enzymes on a solid support system. Siddique et al. (1993) tested immobilized enzymes for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol from aqueous solution. Co-immobilized cell mass and enzyme from Phanerochaete chryso-
sporium  w er e empl o y ed f or the de grada ti on o f PCP (Lin e t al., 1991 ). The 
potential applications of enzymes [horseradish pero xide (HRP), lignin per -oxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and other peroxidases, tyro-sine, and laccases related to phenolic contaminants] have been described by Karam and Nicell (1997).DEGRADATION OF PHENOLS BY FUNGAL ENZYMES 245246 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PHENOLS, CHLOROPHENOLS, AND PCP
7.11.1 Peroxidase-Catalyzed Degradation
Lignin peroxidase (LiP) is a fungal heme protein and oxidizes dimethylated 
aromatic compounds to radical cations. Paszczynski et al. (1986) ﬁ  rst reported 
an extensive study on the oxidation of phenols by LiP. A mechanism for the veratryl alcohol–mediated indirect oxidation of phenol by LiP has been pro-posed (Chung and Aust, 1995). Table 7.6 lists rates of degradation or miner-alization, metabolic products of phenolics, chlorophenols, and PCP by fungal peroxidases.
Only about 10% of PCP remains in nitrogen-limited cultures after 30 hours 
by P. chrysosporium  (Reddy and Gold, 2000). However, about 90% of PCP 
remains under nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient conditions. Three metabolites are produced 
in nitrogen-limited cultures. Under nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient conditions, PCP under-
goes ortho -methylation to produce pentachloroanisole as a sole metabolite. 
Several metabolites are identiﬁ  ed during the respective addition of tetrachlo-
rodihydroxybenzene, trichlorodihydroxybenzene, and 2,5-dichloro-1,4-dihydroxybenzene in nitrogen-limited cultures. Similar metabolites are identiﬁ  ed during transformation of these compounds in nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient 
cultures. LiP and MnP catalyze oxidations of PCP to chlorobenzoquinone. Both enzymes also oxidize tetrachlorodihydroxybenzene to its corresponding benzoquinone. A pathway proposed for the complete dechlorination of PCP by P. chrysosporium  is shown in Figure 7 . 7 . Reductive dechlorination reac-
tions are also involved in the degradation of 2,4,6-TCP by P. chrysosporium
and several other white-rot fungi (Reddy et al., 1998). A similar quinone reduction step has also been noted during degradation of 2,4,5-TCP and 2,4-DCP by P. chrysosporium  (Valli and Gold, 1991; Joshi and Gold, 1993).
Four metabolites are generated by withdrawal of one-electron oxidation of 
bisphenol A (BPA) by MnP of Pleurotus ostreatus  (Hirano et al., 2000). A 
pathway of BPA metabolism by MnP of P. ostreatus  has been proposed which 
is quite different from bacteria (Spivack et al., 1994). BPA is converted to compounds with no estrogen activity by MnP of P. chrysosporium  ME-466, 
and the main products are considered to be trimers and tetramers (Tsutsumi et al., 2001). The initial steps of ferulic acid polymerization by LiP isozyme H1 from high-nitrogen cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  BKM-F-
1767 lead to the formation of three dehydrodimers and two trimers (Ward et al., 2001). This is the ﬁ  rst report of identiﬁ  cation of trimers from LiP oxida-
tion of ferulic acid, and these are formed by decarboxylation of dehydrodimer intermediates. The dehydrodimers and trimers are further oxidized by LiP, implying that they are the only intermediates in the polymerization of ferulic acid.
7.11.1.1 Peroxidase Bioreactors.  A two-stage immobilized MnP bioreac-
tor has been optimized for the catalytic generation of Mn(III) and subsequent oxidation of chlorophenols using Lentinula  (Lentinus ) edodes  (Grabski et al., 
1998). Puriﬁ  ed MnP from L. edodes  was covalently coupled through its 
carboxyl groups using an azlactone-functional copolymer of EEDQ TABLE 7.6 Peroxidase-Catalyzed Degradation of Phenols and Metabolic Products

Emphaze beads. Figure 7.8 shows MnP immobilized reactor 1, catalyzing the H
2O2-dependent oxidation of Mn(II), generating Mn(III)-chelates. Mn(III)-
chelates are pumped to reactor 2 for the oxidation of chlorophenols, and the oxidation products along with Mn(II) can be removed or returned to reactor 1 for regeneration. The optimized conditions resulted in oxidation of 1.0 mM Mn(II) to Mn(III) at 78% efﬁ  ciency and about 69% efﬁ  ciency after 
24 hours of continuous operation.
Phenol can be removed from synthetic wastewater in batch, continuous, 
and discontinuous semibatch reactors by Coprinus macrorhizus  peroxidase 
(CMP) (Al-Kassim et al., 1994a). Nearly 90% phenol was eliminated with the addition of three discrete aliquots of either H
2O2 or CMP over 0.5 hour 
in discontinuous reactors. Discontinuous addition of the reactants enhanced the removal of phenol by CMP and conserved 1 : 1 phenol to peroxide stoichi-ometry in the reaction. Al-Kassim et al. (1994b) also reported catalysis of the same reactions by C. macrorhizus  peroxidase (CMP) as HRP in the removal 
of toxic organics from synthetic wastewater. Kjalke et al. (1992) reported the similarity of Arthromyces ramosus  peroxidase (ARP) to Coprinus cinereus
peroxidase (CIP) and C. macrorhizus  peroxidase (CMP) and a close taxo-
nomic relationship between Coprinus  and Arthromyces  species.

Wiley & Sons.]tyrosinases have been discussed by van Gelder et al. (1997). PPO can be 
obtained from fungal sources such as the common mushroom Agaricus bispo-
rus and the bread mold Neurospora crassa . PPO catalyzes the hydroxylation 
of monophenols to ortho -diphenols using O 2 to yield catechols and subse-
quent oxidation to form ortho -quinones (Figure 7.9). The ortho -
quinones undergo spontaneous nonenzymatic polymerization producing water-insoluble polymers that can be separated from solution by ﬁ  ltration. 
PPO requires O
2 as an oxidant compared to stoichiometric amounts of H 2O2
by peroxidase. The major drawback of PPO is the marked product inhibition caused by ortho -quinones binding with the active site of the enzyme. PPO 
can be applied as a waste minimization strategy for efﬂ  uent treatment. Dec 
and Bollag (1990) examined the ability of mushroom tyrosinase to polymer-ize substituted phenols. The optimum pH for tyrosinase ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 and the optimum temperature was 25°C. Removal of dehalogenated phenols decreased with an increasing number of chlorines and an increasing molecular weight of the substituent.
The kinetics between 4- tert-butylphenol (4-TBP) and mushroom tyrosi-
nase has been studied by Ros et al. (1994). The kinetics of oxidation of phenol substrates by tyrosinase has been widely discussed (Naish-Byﬁ  eld et al., 1994; 
Naish-Byﬁ  eld and Riley, 1998). Such studies on the action of PPO to mono-
phenols have been shown to produce fairly stable ortho -quinones, such as 4-
hydroxyanisole (4-HA), 4-ethoxyphenol (4-EP), and 4- tert-butylphenol 
(4-TBP). A kinetic mechanism based on structural aspects developed by Wilcox et al. (1985) has been proposed to explain enzyme action in Scheme 1a + b (Cabanes et al., 1987). A kinetic mechanism of the direct action of 
tyrosinase on monophenol releasing ortho -diphenol to the reaction medium 
has been examined by Fenoll et al. (2000). However, several researchers do not concur with this mechanism (Sayre and Nadkarni, 1994; Cooksey et al., 1998). Reducing agents such as Fe(II), serine, and ascorbic acid accelerated the oxidation of monophenols by tyrosinase from Aspergillus ﬂ  avipes  56003, 
decreasing the lag time of the reaction (Gukasyan, 2002).
7.11.2.1 Polyphenol Oxidase/Tyrosinase Bioreactors.  Various types of 
polyphenol oxidase bioreactors are recognized for removal of the phenolic compounds (Table 7.7). Phenols are removed in an aqueous solution by soluble and immobilized mushroom tyrosinase (Wada et al., 1993). Soluble tyrosi-nase removes the substituted phenols in the preferential order catechol >

products are removed by chitin and chitosan, and chitosan enhances the reduction rate of phenols. Rapid removal of colored products can occur by a combination of tyrosinase and two synthetic polymers or coagulants and chi-tosan (Wada et al., 1995). The coagulants are more effective than the chito-san. In one study, total phenol (100%) was removed after 2 hours by treatment with immobilized tyrosinase on cation-exchange resin, and very little loss of activity resulted even after 10 repeated treatments (Wada et al., 1993). Immo-bilized tyrosinase on magnetite showed good retention activity (80%) and storage stability (Wada et al., 1995). Less coagulant was used for the removal o f  c o l o r e d  r e a c t i o n  p r o d u c t s  d u r i n g  i m m o b i l i z e d  t y r o s i n a s e  t r e a t m e n t .  Tyrosinase immobilized between two chitosan gels has been used for phenol removal as a batch system (Sun and Payne, 1996). In recent years, tyrosinase has been immobilized in membranes for the decomposition of phenol.
Chitosan can be processed into a variety of conﬁ  gurations, such as mem-
branes, ﬁ  bers, capsules, and beads. Capillary membrane (Edwards et al., 
1999a) and chitosan-coated internally skinned polysulfone capillary mem-brane (Edwards et al., 1999b) bioreactors using immobilized PPO of the common mushroom Agaricus bisporus  can remove a range of phenols in 
synthetic and industrial efﬂ  uents. The advantages of capillary membrane 
technology for biocatalysis are high surface area/volume ratio and the ability to handle high volume capacities; it can perform a reaction simultaneously with a separate function; there is less susceptibility to process disturbances; and the sterilization requirements are reduced. Using 763 membranes, 100% of 1 mM para -cresol was removed over 8 hours, while 40% conversion was 
achieved using IPS 748 membranes (Edwards et al., 1999a). In a mixed efﬂ  u-
ent, IPS 763 bioreactors removed phenolics better than did IPS 748 mem-branes. This is due to higher ﬂ  ux operating in the IPS 763 bioreactor, which 
results in rapid transport of substrates as well as inhibitory substances in the vicinity of the enzyme. Phenols have been converted by immobilized PPO from A. bisporus  on nylon membranes under various conditions in a semi-
continuous mode (Burton et al., 1998). The disappearance of phenol and the high proportion of quinone products were generated in substrates of low concentration in reactions of PPO immobilized on nylon membranes. IPS 748 membrane results in greater removal of para -cresol than does IPS 763 
membrane.
7.11.3 Laccase-Catalyzed Degradation
Laccase is a heme protein, an attractive para -diphenol oxidase type of bio-
catalyst, and is widely distributed in fungi (Mayer and Staples, 2002). Lac-cases utilize molecular oxygen rather than hydrogen peroxide. Laccases are known to be induced by various aromatic compounds in white-rot fungi. Lac-cases generate phenoxy radicals and semiquinones, followed by spontaneous reactions, resulting in the formation of quinones and several di- and DEGRADATION OF PHENOLS BY FUNGAL ENZYMES 253254 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PHENOLS, CHLOROPHENOLS, AND PCP
oligomeric coupling products. The phenolic substrate, type of laccase, and pH 
inﬂ uence the formation of the product patterns of various phenolic com-
pounds. Different substrate speciﬁ  cities are established for the laccases from 
different fungi and different laccase isoforms from the same fungus. A multiplicative mathematical model has been developed for laccase-catalyzed polymerization of 1-naphthol and biokinetic parameters of activation energy (Akta et al., 2001). The reaction rate constant has been evaluated for the ﬁ  rst 
time.
Laccases are known to oxidize several phenolics, chlorophenols, and PCP 
(Table 7.8). Laccase of Trametes versicolor  oxidizes PCP, forming benzoqui-
none and para - and ortho -chloronils (Konishi and Inoue, 1972). PCP and 
2,4,6-TCP have been dehalogenated in the presence of Trametes  laccase and 
a peroxidase from P.chrysosporium  (Lyr, 1963; Hammel and Tardone, 1988). 
Nearly 89% of 2,4-dichlorophenol was transformed along with 23% dechlo-rination and two dehalogenation number by T. versicolor  laccase (Dec and 
Bollag, 1994). Free radicals of 2-CP, 3-CP, 2,4-DCP, and 2,4,5-TCP can couple to each other in 10 different ways during polymerization. The substi-tuted phenols have been polymerized by laccases from Rhizoctonia praticola
and T. versicolor  (Dec and Bollag, 1990). The detoxiﬁ  cation of phenols due 
to polymerization depended on the chemical structure and concentration of the substrate, pH of the reaction, activity of the enzyme, length of incubation, and temperature. The optimum pH for R. praticola  laccase extended from 
4.5 to 9.0, and for T. versicolor  laccase from 3.0 to 8.0.
The relative activity of the compost extract (crude laccase) of A. bisporus
in terms of time required for oxidation is in the order 2,6-dimethoxyphenol > guaiacol > phenol > ventryl alcohol > aniline (Trejo-Hernandez et al., 2001). 
Complete oxidation of 1 and 5 mg/l of phenol took place within 48 and 125 hours, respectively. The optimum oxidation of phenol occurred at pH 7.0 and 25°C. The rate of dephenolization was 1.07 μg/U per hour for the com-
mercial enzyme and 1.28 μg/U per hour for the crude compost extract. The 
formation of diverse products can be attributed to a radical laccase reaction followed by one-electron withdrawal from BPA from Trametes villosa  (Fukuda 
et al., 2001; Uchida et al., 2001). Puriﬁ  ed extracellular laccase from a fungus 
of family Chaetomiaceae detoxiﬁ  ed BPA and nonylphenol rapidly in the 
absence of mediators (Saito et al., 2004). Their estrogenic activities were completely removed within 24 hours. Polyoxometalates have also been found t o  b e  a n  e f f e c t i v e  p r o m o t e r  o f  l a c c a s e - a s s i s t e d  r e a c t i o n s  ( C a r n e i r o  e t  a l . ,  2000).
In Panus tigrinus , MnP catalyzes the primary attack of 2,4,6-TCP in 
culture, and in Coriolus versicolor , laccase catalyzes it predominantly 
(Leontievsky et al., 2000). Both enzymes in respective fungi degraded 70 to 90% of 2,4,6-TCP and produced similar metabolites after 24 hours. A differ-ent mode of regulation of these enzymes is suggested in two fungi. Blue laccase of P. tigrinus  is also capable of both polymerizing and depolymerizing 
soil humic acids in vitro (Zavarzina et al., 2004). Puriﬁ  ed laccase from C.TABLE 7.8 Laccase-Catalyzed Degradation of Phenols and Metabolic Products

tively, within 72 hours at pH 5.0 (Ullah et al., 2000a). Laccase reaction with 100 μg/ml PCP produced polymers of 80 000 MW with the formation of ortho -
and para -chloranils.
Laccase from Pyricularia oryzae  catalyzed an oxidative coupling reaction 
between 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) and ortho- ,
meta- , and para- methoxyphenols and produced red azo compounds (Setti 
et al., 1999). The ﬁ  rst step in the mechanism is the initiation of MBTH activa-
tion that undergoes an electrophilic substitution with meta -methoxyphenol in 
solution, enzymatic activated guaiacol, and chelated para -methoxyphenol at 
the catalytic site of the laccase. Different hydroxy- and methoxy-substituted phenols were oxidized by two laccase isozymes (laccase I and laccase II) from Pleurotus eryngii  (Munoz et al., 1997). Both isozymes exhibited similar sub-
strate speciﬁ  cities. Laccase I catalyzed higher rates of reactions than laccase 
II. Reactions of hydroquinones with laccase isozymes produce semiquinones, which in turn are partially converted to quinones via autooxidation. Two laccase isozymes (POXA1 and POXA2) produced by Pleurotus ostreatus
have been puriﬁ  ed and characterized (Palmieri et al., 1997). Both isozymes 
showed oxidation of syringaldazine and 2,2 ′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-
6-sulfonate) together with a variety of substituted phenols with concomitant reduction of oxygen, but POXA1 does not oxidize guaiacol. POXA2 exhibits the presence of four copper atoms per mole, while two zinc, one copper, and one iron atoms per mole are found in POXA1. POXA1 is unique in the neutral pI and anomalous metal content. Lack of absorbance at 600 nm clas-siﬁ es POXA1 as a novel “white” laccase.
The oxidative transformation of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allyl phenol (DMAP) to 
the corresponding quinone methide takes place by mushroom tyrosinase (Krol and Bolton, 1997). Sugumaran and Bolton (1998) reported that laccase, not tyrosinase, is responsible for the formation of quinone methide from DMAP. The reaction involves an unusual 1,6-oxidation rather than the con-ventional 1,4-oxidation. Laccase is documented to oxidize syringaldazine, a structural analog of DMAP to quinone methide. A mechanism for the oxida-tion of DMAP by laccase has been proposed.
7.11.3.1 Inﬂ  uence of Cosubstrates.  Industrial wastewaters are always het-
erogeneous, and the presence of highly reactive substrates can be beneﬁ  cial 
for the detoxiﬁ  cation of toxic compounds. Substrate removal can be enhanced 
due to a secondary chemical reaction between less reactive substrates and products formed during enzymatic oxidation of easily removed substrates. The aspects of the secondary chemical reaction have not been given good attention by researchers.
The reactive cosubstrates guaiacol and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol can inﬂ  uence 
the removal of chlorinated phenols by a laccase from Trametes versicolor
(Roper et al., 1995). Removal of 2,4,5- TCP was enhanced from 8% to 85% by the addition of 20 mM guaiacol with T. versicolor  laccase. Guaiacol also DEGRADATION OF PHENOLS BY FUNGAL ENZYMES 257258 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PHENOLS, CHLOROPHENOLS, AND PCP
improved the removal of 2,4-DCP from 38% to 70% and of 4-chlorophenol 
fr o m  5 %  t o  20%.  La ccas e  o f  Pleurotus eryngii  degraded 95% of 2,4-DCP 
after 6 hours in the presence of 2,2 ′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-
sulfonate) (ABTS) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) (Rodriguez et al., 2004). However, lower efﬁ  ciency of 60% degradation occurs in the absence 
of mediators.
Partially puriﬁ  ed laccase of Coriolus versicolor  shows transformation of 
chlorophenols in the order 2,4,6-TCP > 2,6-DCP > 2,4-DCP > 2-CP > 2,3-
DCP (Itoh et al., 2000). Phenols with chlorine atoms at the ortho - and para -
positions are more susceptible to laccase, and the reactivity increases with an increase in chlorine atoms. However, phenolic acids such as sinapinic acid increase degradation of 2,4,5-TCP, 2,4,6-TCP, 2,4-DCP, and 4-CP, whereas ferulic acid and para -coumaric acids inhibit degradation of 2,4,6-TCP, 2,3-, 
2,4- and 2,6-DCPs, and 2-CP. The three phenolic acids have similar chemical structures, but their effects on the degradation of chlorophenols are different. Reaction schemes estimated for laccase-mediated transformation of 2,4-DCP with sinapinic and ferulic acid have been proposed. Two products were formed initially due to oxidation of ferulic acid by laccase (Carunchio et al., 2001).
A range of solid substrates for laccase production by C. versicolor  has been 
evaluated for the development of a system for use in the bioremediation of chlorophenols in aqueous efﬂ  uents (Ullah et al., 2000b). The substrates were 
wood chips, cereal grains, and wheat husk and bran. Wheat husk and bran supported the highest amount of laccase, <25 U/g after 30 days of coloniza-
tion. Laccase extracted from wheat husk and bran cultures removed 100% of 2,4-dichlorophenol (50 ppm) within 5 hours and 75 to 80% of PCP (50 ppm) within 24 hours. Pellets were formulated of wheat bran with biscuit ﬂ  our to 
form a compact substrate for fungal immobilization.
7.11.3.2 Laccase Bioreactors.  Soluble and immobilized laccase from 
Rhizoctonia praticola  on Celite are used to precipitate phenols from solution 
(Shuttleworth and Bollag, 1986). The amount of substrate removed depends on both the substituent group and the position of substitution. Transformation of 2,4-dichlorophenol occurs by fungal laccase immobilized on soil and clay, and similar efﬁ  ciencies in immobilized and free enzymes have been 
found (Ruggeiro et al., 1989). Laccase can be immobilized by entrapment in calcium–alginate gel beads and by covalent coupling to activated carbon (Davis and Burns, 1990, 1992). Leonowicz et al. (1988) demonstrated the useful pH range and increased resistance to extremes of temperature for laccase immobilized on glass beads. Naturally occurring and xenobiotic aro-matic compounds were detoxiﬁ  ed from aqueous suspensions by organic gel-
entrapped tyrosinase, and laccase and enzymes were reused several times without a reduction in efﬁ  ciency (Crecchio et al., 1995). Immobilized enzymes 
have wide applications in membrane bioreactors. Laccase bioreactors are also known to remove phenolics and chlorophenols (Table 7.8).7.11.4 Miscellaneous Enzymes
Table 7.9 lists miscellaneous fungal enzymes and mechanisms for the degrada-
tion of various phenolic compounds. Nitration of phenols with HRP, lipoxi-dase, lactoperoxidase, chloroperoxidase (CPO), and Coprinus cinereus
peroxidase (CIP) has been demonstrated (Budde et al., 2001). CPO has been found to be a poor nitration catalyst, lactoperoxidase to be less effective than other peroxidases, and peroxidase from C. cinereus  t o  b e  a s  e f f e c t i v e  a s  
lipoxidase from soybean. CPO from Caldariomyces fumago  catalyzed the 
chlorination of different phenolic compounds (Wannstedt et al., 1990). The metabolic products of several reactions and the percentages have been mea-sured. Phenols have been polymerized and precipitated in aqueous solutions after treatment with CIP and H
2O2 (Kauffmann et al., 1999). Expression of 
recombinant CIP in Aspergillus oryzae  (Petersen et al., 1993), comparison of 
wild-type, recombinant, and three mutants of CIP (Veitch et al., 1994), and detailed comparison of wild-type CIP and its Asp245-Asn (D245N) mutant (Sm ule vich e t al., 1996; V e i tch e t al., 1996), ha v e sh o wn the importance o f CIP for phenol removal in industrial wastewaters. Gomez-Toribio et al. (2001) investigated the production of H
2O2 during oxidation of three lignin-derived 
hydroquinones by the ligninolytic versatile peroxidase (VP) by Pleurotus
eryngii . A wide range of phenols, including hydroquinones, can be oxidized 
by VP, either directly similar to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), or indirectly [Mn(II) to Mn(III) oxidation] similar to MnP. P. eryngii  VP in the presence 
of Mn(II) degrades 65% of 50 μM 2,4-DCP within 1 hour (Rodriguez et al., 
2004). However, 100% degradation of 2,4-DCP occurred after 2 hours by VP in the absence of Mn(II).
Extracellular diphenol oxidases from Pleurotus ostreatus  are produced 
in culture broths supplemented with solid straw or tobacco juice (Garzillo et al., 1992). Palmieri et al. (1993) characterized three different phenol oxidases produced by P. ostreatus . This knowledge can be used in the devel-
opment of bioreactor for wastewater treatment. Bonomo et al. (1998) isolated two isoforms of laccase as the predominant phenol oxidases by the white-rot fungus Rigidoporus lignosus . A speciﬁ  c phenol oxidase, N-acetyl-6-
hydroxytryptophan oxidase, produced during conidiophore development in Aspergillus nidulans  has been puriﬁ  ed (Birse and Clutterbuck, 1990). A 
temperature-sensitive mutant produces a thermolabile enzyme that can oxidize para -cresol.
In recent years, several plant and animal enzymes have been used in the 
treatment of phenols. Ricoux et al. (2001) showed the ability of microperoxi-dase 8 (MP8) to catalyze the nitration of phenol by nitrite. Soybean peroxi-dase (SBP) catalyzes the precipitation and polymerization of aqueous phenols, and this treatment is less expensive than HRP.DEGRADATION OF PHENOLS BY FUNGAL ENZYMES 259TABLE 7.9 Fungal Enzymes for Degradation of Phenols

2607.12 FUNGAL TRANSFORMATION OF PENTACHLOROPHENOL 
IN SOILS
Only during the last decade has fungal transformation of pentachlorophenol 
in soils received some consideration. However, more work is required to elu-cidate the process of transformation in soils. In general, the mycorrhizal fungi show less tolerance to creosote than the saprophytic fungi (Richter et al., 2003). Of saprophytic fungi, Irpex lacteus ,Neolentinus lepideus ,Ouedeman-
siella radicata ,P. chrysosporium ,Postia placenta , and T. versicolor  exhibit 
the greatest tolerance to creosote. Mycorrhizal fungi such as Cenococcum
geophilum , one isolate each of Laccaria bicolor  and L. laccata , and Suillus
granulatus  show the highest tolerance to creosote. Rates of degradation or 
mineralization and metabolic products of PCP in soils by fungi are organized in Table 7.10.
7.12.1 Bound Residue Formation
Humic substances are amorphous, partly aromatic, and mostly dark-colored 
m a t e r i a l s  t h a t  a r e  f o r m e d  i n  s o i l  b y  c o n d e n s a t i o n  o f  p o l y p h e n o l s  a n d  q u i -nones. Microbial transformations such as decarboxylation and demethoxyl-ation release different types of phenolic compounds, which are precursors of humic acid polymers. Covalent incorporation of chlorophenols into soil organic matter can occur via free radical–mediated copolymerization and/or its degradation product and organic precursors of humic and fulvic acids. A signiﬁ  cantly lower amount of such incorporation occurs in Pleurotus ostreatus
(Bogan et al., 1999). About 90% transformation of PCP to nonextractable residues is noted in some model soils. P. ostreatus  has the ability to catalyze 
the incorporation of PCP into bound residues. Spiking of low concentration of PCP into uncontaminated soil is noted. The binding of PCP to humic materials seems to be catalyzed by oxidative enzymes. In vitro studies have shown the binding of humic acid and fulvic acid by peroxidases and laccases (Bollag, 1991; Bollag et al., 1992).
A large part (34 to 65%) of [
14C]PCP in contaminated soil is bound to soil 
organic matter by white-rot fungi (Ruttimann-Johnson and Lamar, 1997). The highest amounts (20 to 36%) of PCP bind with humic acid. Fungal cul-tures show lower binding to fulvic acid (8.7 to 17.5%) and humin (5 to 11%). P. ostreatus  i s  th e  m o s t  e fﬁ  cient in binding (65%) to all three fractions of 
humic materials, followed by Irpex lacteus ,T. versicolor , and Bjerkandera
adusta . Mineralization of PCP in soils is low. Of three white-rot fungi, I.
lacteus  mineralizes the highest amounts, converting 8.8% of the PCP to CO
2
after 9 weeks. The mineralization rates are highest between 10 and 25 days. 
The rate of methylation of PCP to pentachloroanisole (PCA) is in the low range (0 to 6.8%).FUNGAL TRANSFORMATION OF PENTACHLOROPHENOL IN SOILS 261TABLE 7.10 Fungal Transformation of Pentachlorophenol in Soils

2627.12.2 Degradation and Mineralization
PCP transformation results in the formation of toxic breakdown products in 
soils inoculated with Phanerochaete chrysosporium  (McGrath and Singleton, 
2000). PCP concentrations in all nonsterile soils are reduced from 250 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg after 6 weeks of incubation at 25°C. No PCP transformation is found in sterile soils. The dehydrogenase activity decreases considerably in all soils containing PCP and does not recover after 6 weeks, despite the decrease in PCP levels. Soil methanol extracts from PCP-contaminated soils inoculated with the fungus prove completely inhibitory for the growth of Bacillus megaterium  after 6 weeks. PCP is also transformed in sterilized 
and nonsterilized soils inoculated with solid substrate cultures of Lentinus
(Lentinula )edodes  LE2 (Okeke et al., 1997). The kinetics of biotransforma-
tion by monocultures demonstrates rapid PCP depletion within the initial 4 weeks, and 99% depletion in 10 weeks. Phenol oxidase and MnP activities rise rapidly, reaching 195.5 U/g and 138.4 U/g after 2 weeks, respectively. The disappearance of PCP and biomass (ergosterol) accumulation are strongly correlated. In mixed cultures of nonsterilized soils, 42% PCP disappeared and enzyme activities were markedly lower after 10 days. High-resolution gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (HRGC/MS) reveals the presence of PCP transformation products such as PCA, tetrachloroanisole, and tetra-chlorophenol in the ﬁ  rst 4 weeks in both sterilized and nonsterilized soils. L.
edodes  monoculture shows higher dechlorination efﬁ  ciency (29.50%) than 
does a mixed culture (22.40%).
An overall 88 to 91% PCP was depleted from the upper 25 cm of sandy 
gravel contaminated soil of pH 9.6 inoculated with P. chrysosporium  or 
Phanerochaete sordida  in 6.5 weeks (Lamar and Glaser, 1990). Fungal inocula 
are grown completely on wood chips. This involves mineralization, methyla-tion to PCA, and formation of soil-bound residues. Only 9 to 14% of the PCP is converted to PCA, and methylation is not the major route of PCP transfor-mation. Inocula of each of three white-rot fungi ( P. chrysosporium ,P. sordida ,
and Trametes hirsuta ) are also prepared from pure cultures grown on nutri-
ent-fortiﬁ  ed sawdust grain mixture. This treatment with P. sordida  removes 
89% of PCP in strongly acidic contaminated clay oil of pH 3.8 after 8 weeks.
Solid-state culture (SSC) can be employed in different bioremediation 
strategies in contaminated soils. Efﬁ  cient bioremediation depends on an 
increase in the biomass of degrading fungi in the contaminated soils. Fila-mentous fungi can also be used in these processes. One advantage is that these fungi grow faster than Basidiomycetes, and often at low temperatures. Rhizopus nigricans  isolated from paper mill efﬂ  uent showed a high tolerance 
to grow in the presence of 100 mg PCP/l (Cortes et al., 2002). The fungus displayed a higher efﬁ  ciency in the removal of PCP in SSC than in submerged 
culture. In SSC, 60% PCP degraded within 24 hours at an initial concentra-tion of 12.5 mg PCP/l. The same strain degraded 66% of PCP in 144 hours at FUNGAL TRANSFORMATION OF PENTACHLOROPHENOL IN SOILS 263264 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PHENOLS, CHLOROPHENOLS, AND PCP
the same initial concentration in submerged culture (Cortes et al., 2001). The 
maximum CO 2 release rate is 3.5 ml/h per gram idm at 0, 12.5, and 25 mg 
PCP/l. These features indicate that it is an interesting alternative for bio-remediation processes. Moreover, R. nigricans  degrades PCP with enzymes 
(phenol oxidases) that are more stable than the enzymatic systems (peroxi-dases) found in P. chrysosporium  and other Basidiomycetes. Degradation of 
2,4-DCP and PCP occurs on wheat straw cultures of the brown-rot fungi Gloeophyllum striatum  and G. trabeum  and the white-rot fungus T. versi-
color  (Fahr et al., 1999). T. versicolor  reveals the highest mineralization 
(43%) of PCP after 6 weeks. Ligninolytic enzymes are not detected in Gloeo-
phyllum  on wheat straw, suggesting new evidence of a degradation mechanism 
independent of such enzymes. Wetzstein et al. (1997) also discussed the absence of ligninolytic enzymes in Gloeophyllum striatum . D’Souza et al. 
(1996) reported on the scarce evidence for the occurrence of ligninolytic enzymes in brown-rot fungi. However, T. versicolor  produces MnP, MIP and 
laccase on wheat straw throughout the cultivation period with maximum activities after 1 week.
7.12.3 Fungal Augmentation
Fungal augmentation of high-quality inoculums with high potential can be 
introduced to contaminated soils. Preliminary methods have been developed for the production of fungal inocula for bioaugmentation of contaminated soils. These inocula can be in the form of pelleted solid substrates coated with fungal mycelium, prepared from cheap agricultural and industrial by-products. Pelleted inocula have certain advantages over fungal carriers used earlier such as corncobs, wood chips, or straw. Fungal inocula can be opti-mized in substrate composition to enhance fungal growth, degradation abili-ties, and competitiveness against native soil microbes. To optimize fungal growth and degradation ability, methods to measure biomass are yet to be developed. The difﬁ  culty of separating fungal mycelia from solid substrates 
leads to indirect methods for the estimation of biomass and activity. These include methods measuring cell constituents, biological activity, and nutrient consumption (Desgranges et al., 1991). The ﬂ  uorescein diacetate (FDA) 
hydrolyzing activity assay is also employed for microbial biomass growth, which measures the activity of a number of enzymes.
The FDA assay is evaluated as an indicator of biological potential of solid 
pellet inoculums for bioaugmentation of contaminated soils with white-rot fungi (Lestan et al., 1996). The FDA activity of Phanerochaete chryso sporium
grown in pellets correlates with mycelia dry weight and ergosterol content of fungal mycelium. In addition to optimum substrate composition, optimum temperature and pellet structure inﬂ  uence high metabolic activity, prolifera-
tion, and PCP tolerance of P. chrysosporium .P. chrysosporium , and T. ver-
sicolor  introduced on PCP-contaminated soils on pellets with high biological 
potential and high nitrogen content (C : N ratio of 50 : 1) are unable to remove PCP more efﬁ  ciently than fungi introduced on pellets with a lower biological 
potential (C : N ratio of 309 : 1). However, PCP is signiﬁ  cantly transformed to 
PCA using pellets of lower biological potential. T. versicolor  inoculated in 
soil with pellets of high biological potential shows higher MnP activity than to soil inoculated with pellets of lower biological potential.
A practical method is developed to promote the growth of white-rot fungi 
in soil without the use of large quantities of amendments or inoculum (Boyle, 1995). In T. versicolor , MnP and laccase activities increase with addition of 
either a carbon or nitrogen source and are enhanced by the addition of both supplements. Alfalfa is a more effective source of these nutrients than other amendments. Fungi colonize alfalfa-amended nonsterile soil due to competi-tion from other microorganisms. Mineralization of [
14C]PCP is more rapid in 
soil amended with alfalfa and benomyl and inoculated with T.versicolor .
About 1.25% of the 30 ppm PCP in the soil degraded to CO 2 per day during 
the 4-day period. The maximum MnP and laccase activities were 243 and 591 U/nM substrate oxidized per minute per gram respectively, on the third day of incubation. Based on a different growth assay (epiﬂ  uorescence micros-
copy image analysis), Morgan et al. (1993) concluded that an amendment of ground wheat straw (similar to alfalfa) is effective at stimulating growth of white-rot fungi in soils.
7.13 CYTOCHROME P450 SYSTEMS IN DEGRADATION 
OF PHENOLS
The involvement of cytochrome P450 to catalyze a wide range of monoxygen-
ase reactions, including endogenous and xenobiotic substrates, is well estab-lished. The metabolism of 2,4-DCP has been examined using microsomal fractions and whole cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  strain AH22 contain-
ing human cytochrome P450 3A4 (Mehmood et al., 1997). Type I substrate binding spectrum with a K
s value of 75 μM is noted with 2,4-DCP. 2,4-DCP 
is metabolized efﬁ  ciently into two metabolites: 2-chloro-1,4-hydroxyquinone 
and 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone in microsomal fractions and whole cells of yeast expressing human cytochrome P450 3A4. Biotransformation by whole cells also leads to the formation of a further metabolite, 1,2,4-hydroxybenzene. The metabolism depends on nicotinamide adenine dinucle-otide phosphate (NADPH) in microsomal fractions, and no activity is detected in control microsomal fractions or whole cells of control transfor-mants. Based on the identiﬁ  cation of metabolites, a pathway of 2,4-DCP bio-
transformation by yeast expressing human P450 3A4 is proposed. The ﬁ  rst 
step in this pathway is the hydroxylation of 2,4-DCP to metabolite, 2-chloro-1,4-hydroxyquinone, and this reaction has also been reported in white-rot fungi (Valli and Gold, 1991). The other two metabolites are 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone, anticipated as a product of peroxidase metabolism of 2,4-DCP, a n d  1 , 2 , 4 - h y d r o x y b e n z e n e  a s  P 4 5 0  3 A 4 - m e d i a t e d .

microsomes contain dehydrogenase acting on 2-chloro-1,4-hydroxyquinone. 
Either or both chlorine atoms from 2,4-DCP can also be removed by P450 3A4.
Cytochrome P450s of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  are involved in 23 
hydroxylation and two deethylation reactions with 11 substrates, indicating unique and diverse functions (Matsuzaki and Wariishi, 2004). At least 148 P450 genes exist in P. chrysosporium  genome (Martinez et al., 2004), and 
functional diversity is expected.
7.14 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
A number of fungi have been screened, isolated, and the mechanism of action 
and pathways of metabolism of various phenols studied and elucidated. Enzymes involved in these pathways have also been isolated; however, little is known about the genes encoding these enzymes.
Different types of fungal bioreactors are established for the treatment of 
phenolic wastewaters. Bioﬁ  lms of white-rot fungi can be employed that show 
less susceptibility to variation in the chemical composition of wastewater feeds. Considerable success has been achieved in the immobilization of fungal cells in sorbent (Godjevargova et al., 1998) and membrane bioreactors (Luke and Burton, 2001). The effectiveness of fungal laccases immobilized in mem-brane reactors (Lante et al., 2000) has been demonstrated to couple both the effects of enzyme action and those due to membrane ﬁ  ltration. Limited 
knowledge suggests enhanced removal of chlorophenols in the presence of cosubstrates by laccase and can open new horizons for the rapid treatment of heterogeneous wastewaters. However, the optimization of culture conditions, feed composition, and operation needs to be fully investigated before its use in bi or eactors. In fact, the system sh o uld be designed in a w a y tha t can be beneﬁ  cial for the long-term operation of bioreactors.
The potential of certain fungi in ﬁ  eld bioremediation can be enhanced by 
a number of factors. This includes an increase in the inoculum biomass/soil ratio and supplementation of the soil culture system, such as bark chips, straw, or sawdust. Partial sterilization of soil through fumigation may also be useful for the process. PCP is depleted in both the presence and absence of natural soil microﬂ  ora by Lentinula edodes  biomass in sawdust (Okeke et al., 1997). 
E n g i n e e r e d  s o i l  c e l l s  l e a d  t o  s u c c e s s f u l  m y c o r e m e d i a t i o n  o f  a g e d  P C P -contaminated soil by Trametes versicolor  (Walter et al., 2005). Certain soil 
fungi of Deuteromycetes can also be involved in the self-puriﬁ  cation pro-
cesses in soil. These soil fungi metabolize halophenols to form a less toxic dienelactone or polymerize after oxidation, resulting in the formation of humus-like insoluble compounds. Moreover, it is useful to screen efﬁ  cient or 
sensitive strains that can be employed in soil remediation.
Advancement in molecular biotechnology has not thrown any light on the 
recombinant fungi related to biodegradation of phenols and related com-REFERENCES 267
pounds. Fungal genes speciﬁ  c for the degradation of phenols have not been 
isolated. However, three puriﬁ  ed proteins, PcpA, PcpB, and PcpC, are iso-
lated in Flavobacterium  sp. ATCC 39723, which are involved in the break-
down of PCP and other halogenated phenols (Orser et al., 1997). Three cloned genes, pcpA, pcpB, and pcpC, encoding these proteins and two addi-tional genes, pcpD and pcpR, involved in PCP degradation have been reported. A great future lies in the isolation of such proteins and genes in fungi that can be used in mycoremediation applications for the detoxiﬁ  cation of differ-
ent types of phenols.

FUNGAL METABOLISM OF 
POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
8.1 INTRODUCTION
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of ubiquitous xenobiotic 
environmental pollutants that have been detected in several aquatic and ter-restrial ecosystems. PAHs are lipophilic constituents that are released into the environment as a result of a variety of activities, such as incomplete com-bustion of fossil fuels, shale oil, and cigarette smoke; accidental discharge of petroleum or during the use and disposal of petroleum products; and coal gasiﬁ  cation and liquefaction (IARC, 1983). P AHs are also produced due to 
the incineration of refuse and wastes and burning of agricultural and forest residues. The PAH constituents adhere to suspended particles and settle down in soils and sediments of rivers and estuaries.
PAHs consist of three or more benzene rings fused in linear, angular, or 
cluster arrangements. They are thermodynamically stable, due to strong nega-tive resonance energy. Due to their hydrophobic nature and low vapor pres-s u r e ,  t h e y  t e n d  t o  a d s o r b  a n d  a c c u m u l a t e  i n  s e d i m e n t s .  H y d r o p h o b i c i t y  increases and volatility decreases with the number of fused benzene rings. The possible fates of PAH compounds in soils are volatilization, photooxida-tion, chemical oxidation, adsorption, adhesion, and bioaccumulation. Signiﬁ  -
cant loss of PAHs with more than three rings in soils does not happen abiotically. High-molecular-weight PAHs are more recalcitrant than low-molecular-weight PAHs to microbial attack, and this may be attributed to

bioavailability, nutrients, redox potential or other limiting factors. Moreover, 
the half-lives of ﬁ  ve- or six-ring PAHs are estimated to be on the order of 
years in various ecosystems.
Based on the structure and mechanism of activation, many PAHs exhibit 
toxic, mutagenic, tumorigenic, and carcinogenic properties. Several studies have indicated the acute toxicity of low-molecular-weight PAHs and genotox-icity of higher-molecular-weight PAHs. Metabolic activation of PAHs to elec-trophilic species forms covalent binding with nucleophilic groups of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), thereby causing mutations. Due to their per-sistence in the environment and genotoxicity, PAHs represent a signiﬁ  cant 
health risk to humans. Thus, 16 PAHs have been regulated as priority pollut-ants in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by the U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency (Keith and Telliard, 1979). Various approaches have been adopted to establish cleanup criteria in the United States, Canada, European Com-munity, and Scandinavia (Siegrist, 1990; Wilson and Jones, 1993).
Improper disposal methods and inadequate control of these materials have 
created widespread contamination in soils, groundwater, and surface water bodies. It is difﬁ  cult to achieve cleanup at the sites because some remediation 
technologies are not acceptable to the public or may not be amenable to par-ticular sites. A wide variety of physical, chemical, and biological methods have been developed for the treatment of such recalcitrant wastes, but some of these are very expensive. Commonly used strategies of excavation, followed by incineration, and/or landﬁ  lling are now less environmentally acceptable. 
Landfarming has also been employed at less contaminated sites. Since passage of the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), landfarming of such wastes has ceased (Arbuckle et al., 1991). Hence, interest has increased in cleaning up the sites by bioremediation. At present, bioremediation is effec-tive for soils contaminated with low-molecular-weight PAHs.
8.2 OCCURRENCE OF PAHs IN THE ENVIRONMENT
PAHs are widely distributed in the natural environment. They have been 
detected in a wide variety of air, soil, and sediment samples. Contamination by PAHs can be found in foods. PAHs from atmosphere deposition may also accumulate in plants, which may result in human exposure through food consumption. PAHs are also found in creosote (about 85% by weight) and anthracene oil, which are commonly used to treat wood. Motor vehicle emis-sions contribute PAH pollution to the air through exhaust condensate and particulates, tire particles, and lubricating oils and greases. Sources of PAH contamination in sediments include atmospheric deposition, marine seeps of petroleum, and offshore production or petroleum transportation. In indus-trial countries, anthropogenic combustion activities, the main source of PAHs in soils, have increased soil PAH concentration over the last 100 to 150 years. Industrial activities are also associated with the production, processing, use, and disposal of PAH-containing materials. The leaves of Quercus ilex  L. can 
be used to monitor the degree of PAHs in the air (Alfani et al., 2001).
The concentration of PAHs in contaminated soils varies depending on the 
industrial activity at a site. Contamination by PAHs is well established in soils, sediments, and groundwater at different facilities, such as creosote pro-duction and wood preserving, gas works and manufacturing gas plants, and petrochemical and Superfund sites. Various processes are also known to control bioaccumulation of PAHs in marine organisms (Meador et al., 1995). The release of PAHs in the air, soils and sediments, marine organisms and plants has been discussed by Juhasz and Naidu (2000).
8.3 ALTERNATIVE PAH METABOLISM
Effective PAH biodegradation in soils or water is a function of their physical 
and chemical properties, concentrations, rates of diffusion, and bioavailabil-ity. It also depends on soil type, moisture content, presence of nutrients, redox conditions, pH, temperature, sediment toxicity, seasonal factors, PAH-degrading microbes, and other factors. PAH metabolism by microorganisms has been a topic of great interest to several researchers (Cerniglia, 1993; Sutherland et al., 1995; Pothuluri and Cerniglia, 1998; Juhasz and Naidu, 2000).
8.3.1 Bacteria
At present, numerous genera of bacteria have been shown to oxidize P AHs. 
A great diversity of bacteria are known to metabolize low-molecular-weight PAHs, and a few genera are recognized as degrading high-molecular-weight PAHs. Several researchers have shown the role of various species of Rhodo-
coccus ,Mycobacterium ,Alcaligenes ,Pseudomonas ,Beijerinckia ,Staphylo-
coccus ,Arthrobacter ,Nocardia , and Gordona  in the degradation of 
high-molecular-weight PAHs. Recently, Cerniglia (2003) discussed the bacte-rial degradation of PAHs, including the metabolism, mechanism of oxidation, and genetic analysis of Mycobacterium  sp. PYR-1.
In the majority of bacteria, an aerobic pathway for the degradation of 
PAHs involves oxidation of the benzene ring by dioxygenases to form cis-
dihydrodiols, as shown in Figure 8.1 (Cerniglia and Sutherland, 2001). These dihydrodiols are converted to diphenols that are subsequently cleaved by other dioxygenases, and further catabolism results in the formation of tricar-boxylic acid intermediates. A few bacteria catalyze the degradation of PAHs totrans -dihydrodiols. Little is known of the metabolism of PAHs by sulfate-
reducing and methane-oxidizing bacteria. PAHs can also be degraded by aerobic mixed bacteria.
Bacterial metabolism of naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, and 
pyrene has been studied extensively. The mean rate of phenanthrene degrada-tion has been shown to occur due to a sole source of carbon by BeijerinckiaALTERNATIVE PAH METABOLISM 285286 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
mobilis  1f (Surovtseva et al., 1999). The strain also grows in a mineral medium 
with creosote as the sole source of carbon. In Comamonas testosteroni ,l e s s  
homologous group of genes coding for enzymes have been found for the deg-radation of PAHs (Goyal and Zylstra, 1996). Four structural genes and two putative promoters have been identiﬁ  ed for the utilization of naphthalene, 
phenanthrene, and ﬂ  uoranthene in Sphingomonas paucimobilis  var. EPA505 
(Story et al., 2000). Bacillus megaterium  CYP102 mutants exhibit a potential 
for the preparation of novel PAH bioremediation systems (Carmichael and Wong, 2001). A pathway for the metabolism of pyrene by Mycobacterium  sp.

degradation of pyrene by Mycobacterium  sp. strain AP1, which demonstrates 
a new branch in the pathway, involving cleavage of both central rings (Vila et al., 2001).

(Schneider et al., 1996). Five metabolites have been identiﬁ  ed during degrada-
tion of ﬂ  uoranthene by Mycobacterium  sp. strain KR20 (Rehmann et al., 
2001). Bacterial, fungal, and algal benzo[ a]pyrene metabolism, including the 
initial concentrations, percentage removal, evolution of CO 2, time of incuba-
tion, and production of metabolites, have been reviewed by Juhasz and Naidu (2000).
8.3.2 Algae, Cyanobacteria, and Higher Plants
Algae and cyanobacteria were ﬁ  rst shown to degrade PAHs in 1980. A mech-
anism of oxidation of PAHs by algae is shown by Cerniglia (1993). The algal and cyanobacterial metabolism of PAHs have been discussed by some researchers (Sutherland et al., 1995; Juhasz and Naidu, 2000). Green, red, and brown algae and cyanobacteria oxidized naphthalene to 1-naphthol with minor amounts of cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene and 4-hydroxy-
1-tetralone (Cerniglia et al., 1980a). A marine cyanobacterium, Agmenellum 
quadruplicatum  PR-6, transformed phenenthrene to trans -9,10-dihydroxy-
9,10-dihydrophenanthrene and 1-methoxyphenanthrene as major metabolites (Narro et al., 1992a). Naphthalene degraded to 1-naphthol via an arene oxide intermediate by another marine bacterium, Oscillatoria  sp. strain JCM (Narro 
et al., 1992b). However, enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of PAHs by cyano-bacteria are not known at present. Benzo[ a]pyrene has been completely 
metabolized to dihydrodiols under golden and white light by the green algae Selenastrum capricornutum ,Scenedesmus acutus , and Ankistrodesmus 
braunii  (Warshawsky et al., 1995). The formation of cis-dihydrodiols indi-
cates a dioxygenase-catalyzed reaction similar to that of bacteria rather than the monooxygenase-catalyzed reaction that occurs in cyanobacteria, fungi, and mammals.
Several different classes of plants are known to degrade or dissipate or 
remove PAHs in soil and water. The rhizospheres of nine plant species removed a signiﬁ  cant amount of pyrene after 56 days (Liste and Alexander, 
2000). Seeding ﬁ  eld plots with sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ), ryegrass ( Lolium 
perenne ), or St. Augustine grass ( Stenotaphrum secundatum ) enhanced the 
removal of TPHs and PAHs over three growing seasons (Nedunuri et al., 2000). A multiprocess phytoremediation system comprised of volatilization, photooxidation, microbial remediation, and phytoremediation proved twice as effective as landfarming, 50% more than bioremediation alone, and 45% m o r e  t h a n  p h yt o r e m e d i a t i o n  b y  i t s e lf  f o r  t h e  r e m o v a l  o f  1 6  p ri o ri t y  P AH s  over a 4-month period (Huang et al., 2004).
8.4 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF P AHs
Despite the ongoing research during the last two decades, knowledge of the 
fungal metabolism of PAHs is limited compared to that of bacteria. However, FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PAHs 287288 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
fungi are as important as bacteria in the bioremediation of PAHs in aquatic 
and terrestrial environments. Unlike bacteria, fungi do not assimilate PAHs as the sole sources of carbon and energy, but require cometabolite to detoxify them (Wunder et al., 1994; Pothuluri et al., 1995; Casillas et al., 1996). In general, fungi are slow and less efﬁ  cient than bacteria in PAH degradation. 
Bacteria are unable to degrade efﬁ  ciently PAHs that have more than four 
aromatic rings, whereas fungi can degrade and mineralize PAHs with more than four aromatic rings. Oxidation of PAHs as a prelude to ring ﬁ  ssion and 
assimilation is known in bacteria, whereas fungi hydroxylate PAHs as a prelude to detoxiﬁ  cation. Fungi play a signiﬁ  cant ecological role, as their 
polar and reactive metabolites can be mineralized or detoxiﬁ  ed to innocuous 
compounds by indigenous soil bacteria. Moreover, fungal mycelium has the ability to grow into the soil and be distributed through the solid matrix to metabolize PAHs. As a result, fungi can also form bound residues of PAHs in the soil, thereby reducing its toxicity.
A diverse group of fungi has been demonstrated to oxidize PAHs ranging 
from two to six aromatic rings. Fungal species that have demonstrated signiﬁ  -
cant potential to metabolize PAHs are the Zygomycete Cunninghamella 
elegans , the Ascomycetes Aspergillus niger  and Penicillium  sp., and the 
white-rot Basidiomycetes Phanerochaete chrysosporium ,Trametes versicolor ,
Pleurotus ostreatus , and Bjerkandera  sp. Nonbasidiomycete fungi oxidize 
PAHs rather than mineralizing during the initial metabolism. Some white-rot Basidiomycetes have the ability to cleavage benzene rings and mineralize PAHs. The genera of fungi from various ecological groups are also able to degrade PAHs.
In general, ﬁ  lamentous fungi and yeasts have shown oxidative transfor-
mation of P AHs to trans -dihydrodiols, dihydrodiol epoxides, quinones, and 
p h e n o l s  (p h a s e  I  m e c h ani s m ).  Co n j u g a t i v e  p r o d u c t s  (p h a s e  II  m e c h ani s m )  such as glucuronides, glucosides, xylosides, and sulfates are also produced. Conjugation products are nonmutagenic, whereas oxidative products are toxic and bioactive. Arene oxides are unstable intermediates in the formation of corresponding metabolites and have not been isolated from fungal or bacterial cultures. Pathways for the fungal metabolism of PAHs are shown in Figure 8.1 (Cerniglia and Sutherland, 2001). These involve several enzymes, such as intracellular cytochrome P450 and extracellular lignin peroxidase (LiP), man-ganese peroxidase (MnP), and laccase. The formation of hydroxylated metab-olites is noteworthy for bioremediation, as it increases the mineralization of these compounds. Fungal metabolism of PAHs has been discussed by several researchers (Cerniglia et al., 1992; Cerniglia, 1997; Kremer and Anke, 1997; Pothuluri and Cerniglia, 1998; Juhasz and Naidu, 2000; Cerniglia and Sutherland, 2001). Yeast metabolism of PAHs has also been detailed (Cerniglia and Crow, 1981; MacGillivray and Shiaris, 1993). Several articles have been written on the biotransformation of several PAHs by the Zygomyce te Cunninghamella elegans  under Cerniglia’s leadership. Table 8.1 summarizes 
the fungal degradation of various types of PAHs and metabolic products.TABLE 8.1 Fungal Degradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Metabolic Products

8.4.1 Fungal Metabolism of Naphthalene
Naphthalene is a dicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon whose oxidation is demon-
strated by several species of fungi. Several fungi metabolize naphthalene to naphthalene trans -1,2-dihydrodiol, 1- and 2-naphthols, 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone, 
and glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (Cerniglia et al., 1978; Hofmann, 1986). Metabolic pathways for the degradation of naphthalene by fungi have also been depicted (Cerniglia and Gibson, 1977). Less toxicity of conjugation products than of the parent PAH suggests the applicability of C. elegans  to 
remediate naphthalene-contaminated soils. The yeast Candida lipolytica
transforms naphthalene to 1- and 2-naphthols, 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone, and trans -1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, and a pathway has been pro-
posed (Cerniglia and Crow, 1981).
8.4.2 Fungal Metabolism of Acenaphthene
Acenaphthene is a tricyclic fused aromatic hydrocarbon and is considered non-
mutagenic. Acenaphthene has been found to induce cytological and nuclear changes in plants and microorganisms (USEPA, 1987). Little is known about the metabolism of acenaphthene by microorganisms. C. elegans  ATCC 36112 
metabolized 64% of [1,8-
14C]acenaphthene on Sabouraud dextrose medium, 
producing seven metabolites, in work of Pothuluri et al. (1992b).
8.4.3 Fungal Metabolism of Anthracene
Anthracene is a noncarcinogenic tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon found fre-
quently in PAH-contaminated sediments. Bjerkandera adusta  converts less 
than 15% anthracene to anthraquinone (Schutzendubel et al., 1999). Pleuro-
tus ostreatus  exhibits a good correlation between the elimination of anthra-
cene and the accumulation of anthraquinone. Coriolopsis polyzona ,P. 
ostreatus , and Trametes versicolor  can further degrade anthraquinone, and 
its degradation does not appear to be a rate-limiting step (Vyas et al., 1994). Anthracene is metabolized efﬁ  ciently to a dead-end metabolite, anthraqui-
none, by strains of the genera Bjerkandera ,Phanerochaete ,Trametes ,
Ramaria , and Agaricales (Field et al., 1992) and Rhizoctonia solani
(Sutherland et al., 1992). Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS55 degraded 16 EPA 
PAHs from polluted soil extracted with either 2% acetone or ethanol (Field et al., 1996a). Of 39 strains of Micromycetes, 19 strains degraded 50% or more of anthracene (Krivobok et al., 1998). Zygomycetes is the most efﬁ  cient 
group, with a mean degradation of 81%; Melanconiales are least efﬁ  cient, 
with a 41% mean degradation. Among 19 effective strains, nine are new to the literature. Of nine fungal strains, Cunninghamella elegans  IM 1785/21 
Gp was the best performer (Lisowska and Dlugonski, 1999). A pathway pro-posed for the metabolism of anthracene by P. ostreatus  is shown in 
Figure 8.2 (Bezalel et al., 1996c).8.4.4 Fungal Metabolism of Phenanthrene
Phenanthrene is a noncarcinogenic and nonmutagenic tricyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbon found in aquatic and terrestrial oil-contaminated sediments. Of 20 fungal isolates, Pleurotus ostreatus  U AMH 7964 performed best on 2% 
bran ﬂ  akes medium containing phenanthrene (Pickard et al., 1999). Tricho-
sporon penicillatum  showed the highest capacity for phenanthrene biotrans-
formation (MacGillivray and Shiaris, 1993). Phenanthrene 9,10-dihydrodiol DibenzothiopheneS

is a major metabolite produced by Trametes versicolor ,Kuehneromyces muta-
bilis,Agrocybe aegerita , and Flammulina velutipes  (Sack et al., 1997b). 
White-rot fungi transform phenanthrene in the C9,10 positions (K-region); all other fungi produce metabolites substituted in the C1,2, C3,4, and C9,10 positions, similar to soil fungi. The pattern of mineralization by Phanero-
chaete chrysosporium INA-12 did not correlate with the formation of LiP 
activity (Barclay et al., 1995). The sorption of radiolabeled phenanthrene is 40%. Figure 8.3 shows the phase I and phase II metabolism of phenanthrene by three fungi (Casillas et al., 1996). Pathways for the oxidation of phenan-threne by different species of fungi have also been proposed (Cerniglia et al., 1992; Sutherland et al., 1995; Bezalel et al., 1996b; da Silva et al., 2004).
8.4.5 Fungal Metabolism of Fluorene
Fluorene, a tricyclic PAH with a ﬁ  ve-membered ring, is noncarcinogenic but 
highly toxic to ﬁ  sh and aquatic algae. Fluorene was shown to contain 9.5% 
carcinogenic PAHs in a study on the bioremediation of a contaminated soil using phytotoxicity tests (Baud-Grasset et al., 1993). Fluorene is present in most PAH mixtures, and its structure has been found in several mutagenic and/or carcinogenic P AHs, such as 2-aminoﬂ  uorene, 2-nitroﬂ  uorene, and 2-

ing the biodegradation of PAHs.
L e s s  i s  k n o w n  o n  t h e  f u n g a l  m e t a b o l i s m  o f  ﬂ  uorene. Of 30 strains of 
Micromycetes, 12 strains were the best degraders (Garon et al., 2000). Three strains of Cunninghamella  were highly efﬁ  cient, with a mean degradation rate 
of 96%. Two strains each from Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes and three from Deuteromycetes were also highly efﬁ  cient. Eleven strains were new to 
the literature. Oxidation of aliphatic ring in ﬂ  uorene resulted in the formation 
of two monooxygenated metabolites, 9-ﬂ  uorenol and 9-ﬂ  uorenone, by most 
of the strains. Agaricus bitorquis ,Aspergillus terreus ,Penicillium italicum ,
and Oxysporus  sp. revealed the formation of a major metabolite, 9-ﬂ  uorenol 
(>56%), whereas Cylindrocarpon destructans  and Dichotomomyces cejpii
produced 9-ﬂ  uorenol and 9-ﬂ  uorenone as the major metabolites. The forma-
tion of monooxygenated products can be a ﬁ  rst step in the detoxiﬁ  cation 
process. Pleurotus ostreatus  metabolized 96% of ﬂ  uorene in Basidiomycetes 
rich medium (BRM) with the formation of 9-ﬂ  uorenol and 9-ﬂ  uorenone, and 
a pathway has also been proposed (Bezalel et al., 1996c). However, the rate of ﬂ uorene mineralization by P. ostreatus  is very low (Bezalel et al., 1996a). 
C. elegans  detoxiﬁ  es ﬂ uorene with the formation of 9-ﬂ  uorenol, 9-ﬂ  uorenone, 
and 2-hydroxy-9-ﬂ  uorenone (Pothuluri et al., 1993). P. ostreatus  exhibits a 
good correlation between the elimination of ﬂ  uorene and the accumulation 
of 9-ﬂ  uorenone (Schutzendubel et al., 1999). C. elegans  metabolizes about 
81% of [9-
14C]-2-nitroﬂ  uorene, forming six metabolites after 144 hours of 
incubation (Pothuluri et al., 1996a).9-PhenanthrolOH

Surfactants can improve the rate and extent of biodegradation by fungi of

ﬂ ourene was enhanced by Doratomyces stemonitis  (46 to 62%) and Penicil-
lium chrysogenum  (28 to 61%) in the presence of Tween 80 after 2 days. The 
efﬁ ciency of Tween 80 can be attributed to the structure of micelles and/or 
to the mechanism of interaction between micellized surfactant and fungi. The degradation of ﬂ  uorene by Dichotomomyces cejpii  is inhibited by Triton 
X-100.
8.4.6 Fungal Metabolism of Fluoranthene
Fluoranthene is consistently the most abundant tetracyclic aromatic hydro-
carbon in environmental samples. It has been recognized to be cytotoxic, mutagenic, and potentially carcinogenic. Due to its abundance, it is consid-ered more of a potential health hazard than the widely studied but less abun-dant carcinogen benzo[ a]pyrene. Current knowledge on the fungal metabolism 
of ﬂ uoranthene is limited, and the degradation pathways are unknown.
Fluoranthene is better degraded in cometabolism than as a sole source of 
carbon (Cerniglia, 1993). Of 39 strains of Micromycetes, 16 strains degraded 60% or more ﬂ  uoranthene (10 mg/l) after 4 days (Salicis et al., 1999). Zygo-
mycetes of the genus Cunninghamella appeared to be the most efﬁ  cient 
group, with a degradation range of 86 to 98% in liquid synthetic medium. Four strains of Deuteromycetes and three strains of Basidiomycetes showed good degradation capacities. Ten good performant strains were new to the literature. A low mean adsorption (4%) onto fungi has been determined for the strains that show good ﬂ  uoranthene degradation. Some strains of Colleto-
trichum dematicum  and Penicillium italicum  adsorb 47% and 43% of ﬂ  uor-
anthene, respectively. Irpex lacteus  removed 15% of ﬂ  uoranthene on MEG 
medium after 2 weeks (Novotny et al., 2000). An HPLC elution proﬁ  le identi-
ﬁ ed ﬁ  ve metabolites of ﬂ  uoranthene after 120 hours by C. elegans  (Pothuluri 
et al., 1990).
8.4.7 Fungal Metabolism of Chrysene
Chrysene is a tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, a weak carcinogen, and has 
been shown to be genotoxic through use of a mutagenicity assay technique. Chrysene has been metabolized to form non-K-region dihydrodiol and diol epoxides (Sims and Grover, 1981). Pothuluri et al. (1995) were the ﬁ  rst to 
report on the transformation of chrysene by C. elegans . Two major metabo-
lites, sulfate conjugates of 2,8-dihydroxychrysene and 2-hydroxychrysene, have been identiﬁ  ed by UV and 
1H-NMR and account for 33% of the total 
metabolism. A proposed pathway for the degradation of chrysene by C. 
elegans  i s  s h o w n  i n  F i g u r e  8 . 4 .  F o u r  ﬁ  lamentous fungi (i.e., Penicillium janthinellum ,Syncephalastrum racemosum , and two species of Penicillium )
metabolized chrysene and Tween 80 after 10 days at 24ºC (Kiehlmann et al., 1996). About 3% of chrysene was converted to one of the metabolites, trans -1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrochrysene in 6 days. Other metabolites 
have not been structurally identiﬁ  ed. Metabolites constituted 90% of the 
metabolism.Chrysene3212

8.4.8 Fungal Metabolism of Pyrene
Pyrene is a fused tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbon employed as an indicator 
for monitoring PAH-contaminated wastes. Pyrene is not genotoxic, but its quinone intermediates are mutagenic and more toxic than the parent com-pound. It has been used as a model compound to measure binding to DNA and to examine the photochemical and biodegradation of other PAHs.
Based on the dry weights and oxidation of pyrene in both 50 and 100 mg/l, 
Penicillium  strains rank in the order P. terrestre >P. simplicissimum >P.
funiculosum >P. janthinellum  (Saraswathy and Hallberg, 2002). This appears 
to be the ﬁ  rst report of the utilization by fungi of pyrene as a sole carbon and 
energy source. Fusarium solani  and the yeast Rhodotorula glutinis  utilize 
pyrene as the sole source of carbon in liquid mineral medium (Romero et al., 2002). A higher ability to transform pyrene with 
14CO 2 evolution has been 
found in Rhodotorula minuta  and R. glutinis , with the consumption of 35% 
a t  a n  i n i t i a l  c o n c e n t r a t i o n  o f  4 0  m g / l .  O f  4 1  i s o l a t e s  o f  M i c r o m y c e t e s ,  1 0  strains were found to metabolize pyrene highly ( >2.4 mg/g dry weight) (Ravelet 
et al., 2000). The taxonomic distribution of high degraders comprises two from Zygomycetes, six from Deuteromycetes, and one each from Dematia-ceae and Sphaeropsidales. Zygomycetes is found to be one of the most efﬁ  -
cient taxonomic groups, especially Mucor racemosus  var. sphaerosporus ,
which degrades pyrene highly (3.26 mg/g dry weight). Among 10 good per-formers, nine are new to the literature and show good potential for mycore-mediation. Addition of pyrene produced mycelial pellets in two strains of Penicillium ochrochloron  (Saraswathy and Hallberg, 2005).
Pyrene degradation by Penicillium glabrum  TW 9424 in submerged cul-
tures led to the identiﬁ  cation of several metabolites (Wunder et al., 1997). 
This is the ﬁ  rst report on the isolation of methoxylated metabolites of PAHs 
from fungal cultures. I. lacteus  removed nearly 40% pyrene after 2 weeks 
(Novotny et al., 2000). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra reveal that pyrene trans -4,5-dihydrodiol contains 63% 4R,5R enantiomer and 37% 4S,5S enan-
tiomer with an optical purity of 26% (Bezalel et al., 1996c). Pyrene metabo-lism occurs at the 4,5 bond (K-region), resulting in an epoxide that hydrates to produce pyrene trans -4,5-dihydrodiol.
Pyrene-oxidizing strains belong to genera and species of Zygomycetes, 
Ascomycetes, and Deuteromycetes but not Basidiomycetes (Launen et al., 1995). Penicillium  spp. of the subgenus Furcatum  are the most common in 
highly contaminated soils. In Penicillium janthinellum  SFU403, ﬁ  ve metabo-
lites account for 20% of the metabolism (i.e., 14% [
14C]pyrene oxidized and 
25% cell-associated). Almost all pyrene is utilized within 72 to 96 hours. Response-surface methodology has been employed to determine the optimum growth conditions for pyrene oxidation by P. janthinellum  SFU403 (Launen 
et al., 1999). The total optimized biotransformation to oxidation products is approximately 100%. Launen et al. (2000) also showed that pyrenequinones (PQs) bind irreversibly to cells in P. janthinellum  SFU403. About 40% of the inextractable products are bound residues derived from pyrene metabolites, 
and the balance (60%) is attributed to strong sorption of unreacted pyrene. Oxygen consumption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy clearly demonstrate that the intracellular reductants nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione (GSH) can reduce PQs by one-electron oxidation directly to the corresponding semiquinone anion radicals in vitro. Similar reduction of naphthoquinone and benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-dione to the corresponding semiquinone radicals by the NADPH has also been demonstrated by Flowers et al. (1997), and the semiquinone radicals can bind to DNA and redox cycle with oxygen. This supports the fact that the PQs are metabolized to bound residues, possibly via semiquinone intermedi-ates. No studies have been performed to conﬁ  rm in vivo metabolism. Pyrene 
metabolism by P. janthinellum  is shown in Figure 8.5.
Pyrene metabolism by the basidiomycete Crinipellis stipitaria  JK375 leads 
to the identiﬁ  cation of PQs and hydroxylated derivatives (Lambert et al., 
1994). C. stipitaria  JK364 transforms pyrene to trans -4,5-dihydro-4,5-
dihydroxypyrene, 1-hydroxypyrene, and 1-pyrenyl sulfate (Lange et al., 1994). This strain has also been found to mineralize [
14C]pyrene to 14CO 2 and to 
degrade it to [14C]acetic acid. Pyrene is also oxidized by different species and 
strains of basidiomycete genera of Crinipellis ,Marasmius , and Marasmiellus

(Lange et al., 1996). All strains showed the ability to metabolize pyrene in 
submerged culture, but most of the strains transform pyrene more effectively in complex medium. More than 60% pyrene and metabolites, including water-soluble sulfates and disulﬁ  tes, account from the mycelia in fungal cultures. A 
speciﬁ  c pattern of metabolites was formed in each strain, which depends on 
the culture medium. The major pathways of pyrene metabolism by C. stipi-
taria  are shown in Figure 8.6. Pathways for the metabolism of pyrene by A. 
niger  SK 9317 (Wunder et al., 1994), P. ostreatus  (Bezalel et al., 1996c), and 
Cyclothyrium sp. (da Silva et al., 2004) were also proposed.
8.4.9 Fungal Metabolism of Benz[ a]anthracene
Benz[ a]anthracene is a widely distributed tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 
but is a weaker carcinogen than benzo[ a]pyrene. Limited information is 
available on the metabolism of benz[ a]anthracene by microorganisms. 
Two yeasts, Candida krusei  and Rhodotorula minuta , are able to degrade 
benz[ a]anthracene, but the degradation is very limited (MacGillivray 
and Shiaris, 1993). C. elegans  metabolizes [
14C]benz[ a]anthracene to metabo-
lites such as trans -3,4- (4%), trans -8,9- (90%), trans -10,11- (6%), and dihy-pyreneO

Benz[ a]anthracene tetraol, 8 β,9α,10α,11β-tetrahydroxy-8 α,9β,10β,11α-
tetrahydro-benz[ a]anthracene, was identiﬁ  ed as a metabolite, and this may 
be considered as an additional oxidation product of either benz[ a]anthracene 
8,9- or 10,11-dihydrodiol. This was a ﬁ  rst report on the formation of biologi-
cally produced benz[ a]anthracene tetraol. A pathway was also proposed for 
the initial metabolism of benz[ a]anthracene by C. elegans .
8.4.10 Fungal Metabolism of Benzo[ a]pyrene
Benzo[ a]pyrene is a fused pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and is one of 
the most potent carcinogens. Of 17 strains of ﬁ  lamentous fungi, the mycelia 
of six species eliminated more than 40% of benzo[ a]pyrene at 25ºC in 17 days 
(Wunch et al., 1997). A rare fungus, Marasmiellus troyanus , has the capacity 
to achieve extremely high removal rates: up to 95%. Aspergillus ochraceus
was the only fungus to show detectable metabolites in cultures. Extracellular ﬁ ltrate of Hericium erinaceus  revealed the highest removal rate: 45%. The 
sorption of radiolabeled benzo[ a]pyrene by P. chrysosporium INA-12 is 22% 
(Barclay et al., 1995). Candida lipolytica  shows the detection of 3- and 9-
hydroxybenzo[ a]pyrenes within 2 days at an initial concentration of 200 mg/l 
in the presence of glucose (Cerniglia and Crow, 1981). Several metabolites have been detected from benzo[ a]pyrene by C. elegans  on Sabouraud dex-
trose broth (Cerniglia and Gibson, 1980a,b; Cerniglia et al., 1992). A pathway for the fungal oxidation of benzo[ a]pyrene has also been proposed (Cerniglia 
et al., 1992). The sulfate and glucoside conjugates, 3-hydroxybenzo[ e]pyrene 
and 3,10-dihydroxybenzo[ e]pyrene formed during benzo[ e]pyrene metabo-
lism by C. elegans (Pothuluri et al., 1996b).
The relative degradation per unit biomass for three mitosporic fungi, 
Trichoderma viride ,Fusarium solani , and Fusarium oxysporum , is 39%, 
17%, and 8%, respectively (Verdin et al., 2004). The laccase activities of F.
oxysporum , a poor benzo[ a]pyrene degrader, are ﬁ  ve-times higher than those 
of F. solani . In F. solani , sodium azide, a laccase inhibitor, does not reduce 
benzo[ a]pyrene degradation, but the laccase activity is diminished by 50%. 
This suggests that laccase is not involved in benzo[ a]pyrene degradation. T. 
viride  is able to degrade 50% of benzo[ a]pyrene in the absence of laccase and 
peroxidase activities, suggesting that a different pathway is involved in PAH metabolism. F. solani  can store benzo[ a]pyrene in numerous intracellular 
vesicles, independent of the degradation rate (Verdin et al., 2005). About 5.3% of benzo[ a]pyrene is incorporated in the biomass of F. solani  (Veignie 
et al., 2002). F. solani  oxidizes benzo[ a]pyrene in the C1, C3, and C6 posi-
tions. Two metabolites, 1,6- and 3,6-benzo[ a]pyrene quinones, have been 
identiﬁ  ed, suggesting the involvement of cytochrome P450. Poor degradation 
(6.8%) occurred on benzo[ a]pyrene in MM medium with F. solani  after 15 
days (Veignie et al., 2004). Potassium cyanide and piperonyl butoxide (both P450 and peroxidases inhibitors) enhanced benzo[ a]pyrene degradation FUNGAL METABOLISM OF PAHs 305306 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
signiﬁ  cantly: to 16.3% and 22.6%, respectively. It appears that the increased 
availability of H 2O2 i n  f u n g a l  c u l t u r e s  p l ay s  a n  i m p o r t a n t  r o l e  i n  b e n z o [ a]pyrene 
degradation. An alternative metabolic pathway based on free radical produc-tion, such as the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH), which may be agents for the initiation of benzo[ a]pyrene oxidation, was 
hypothesized.
8.5 MUTAGENICITY OF FUNGAL METABOLITES OF PAHs
In general, most of the fungal metabolites produced from P AH metabolism 
are less toxic than the parent compounds to other organisms, and this is an encouraging result of the detoxiﬁ  cation process. However, oxidation products 
such as the quinones or hydroxy derivatives are often more toxic and are mutagenic.
Some minor metabolites produced as a result of substituted and 
methyl-substituted PAH metabolism by fungi are more mutagenic or carci-nogenic than the parent compounds or major metabolites. These compounds are benz[ a]anthracene trans -3,4-dihydrodiol (Cerniglia et al., 1980b), 
benzo[ a]pyrene trans -7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide (Cerniglia and Gibson, 
1980b), 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene trans -3,4-dihydrodiol (Wong et al., 
1983; McMillan et al., 1988), and 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-cholanthrene trans -
9,10-dihydrodiol (Cerniglia et al., 1982). In C. elegans , Pothuluri et al. (1992a) 
showed a decrease in the mutagenic activity of ﬁ  ve metabolites of ﬂ  uoran-
thene toward Salmonella typhimurium  with time, but was not eliminated. 
Similar reductions in the mutagenic activities of benz[ a]anthracene, 7,12-di-
methylbenz[ a]anthracene, benzo[ a]pyrene, or 3-methylcholanthrene have 
been shown toward Salmonella typhimurium  reversion assay without 
total elimination (Cerniglia et al., 1985). The mutagenicity of 7,12-dimethyl-benz[ a]anthracene is reduced in cultures of Syncephalastrum racemosum
after its biotransformation to glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (McMillan et al., 1988). Crinipellis stipitaria produces 1-hydroxypyrene, an initial metab-
olite in pyrene metabolism that shows cytotoxic and mutagenic properties (Lambert et al., 1995).
Sulfate, glucuronide, and glucoside conjugates produced as a result of PAH 
metabolism by fungi exhibit nonmutagenic properties. However, certain micro-organisms contain hydrolytic enzymes that can eliminate the conjugative groups in the environment, thus restoring toxicity.
8.6 FUNGAL BIOREACTORS FOR REMOVAL OF PAHs
Bacterial bioreactors in use are the slurry phase, drum, and/or airlift type. 
A mixed bacterial culture is used for the biological conversion of anthracene-contaminated soil in rotating-drum bioreactors (Gray et al., 1994; Banerjee et al., 1995), which include a combination of effective mixing with a high 
solids content and high aeration rates. Continuous-tank-stirred reactors (CSTRs) are also employed for the aerobic biodegradation of PAHs. Guieysse et al. (2001) obtained fast and complete degradation of PAHs and prevented their hazardous disappearance in a biphasic bioreactor. During the last decade, fungal bioreactors for the degradation of PAHs have been developed. These bioreactors are still in the developmental phase. Fungal bioreactors related to the degradation of PAHs are listed in Table 8.2.
8.6.1 Immobilized Bioreactors
The immobilized bioreactors are the best established for the removal of 
PAHs. Phanerochaete chrysosporium  removes naphthalene, ﬂ  uoranthene, 
and benzo[ a]pyrene in cell-free or immobilized cultures, but 3 days are 
required for the acclimation of these PAHs (Liao et al., 1997). The strain ATCC 24725 was more resistant to PAH toxicity and removed 41% of benzo[ a]pyrene within 30 days. Cell-free strains ATCC 24724 and ATCC 
34541 producing ligninolytic peroxidases exhibited higher removal efﬁ  cien-
cies of benzo[ a]pyrene than strain ATCC 32629. Good removal of naphtha-
lene was attributed to the maintenance of Phanerochaete chrysosporium
activity and the ability to produce ligninolytic enzymes in a PAH-acclimated culture (Liao and Tseng, 1996). One metabolite was identiﬁ  ed as catechol. 
Immobilized P. chrysosporium  has been employed to eliminate surfactant 
Tween 80–solubilized PAHs in a rotating biological contactor (RBC) (Zheng and Obbard, 2002b). A schematic diagram of a bench-scale RBC reactor is shown in Figure 8.7. A reactor in the continuous mode effectively removed all PAHs for a speciﬁ  c loading rate and concentration for each PAH. A linear 
relationship exists between the inverse of PAH removal rate and the inverse of PAH loading rate. The PAH removal exceeded 90% after 60 hours, although a low level of MnP activity was detected. The RBC reactor can be operated for a period of 40 days without diminished effective removal capac-ity. Phenanthrene and pyrene were removed by a combination of fungal oxida-tion and disk foam adsorption, and benzo[ a]pyrene was removed by fungal 
oxidation alone.
8.6.2 Closed-Batch Feed Bioreactors
Based on the principle of washing and bioremediation of soil, the Gebruder 
Huber system has been developed (Schuster and Blank-Huber, 1994; Reinert e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 6 ) .  T h i s  s y s t e m  e m p l o y s  a n  e f ﬁ  cient combination of mechanical

Th e  system is a closed batch feed design equipped with gas scrubbers, thus pre-venting toxic metabolites escape and stripping. The system allows simultane-ous determination of mineralization and mass recovery. The rate of degradation of lower PAHs was 70 to 100% and of higher PAHs was 6 to 50%. HPLC analyses reveal high levels of polar 
14C-labeled metabolites. This degradation 
is due to direct polymerization on the soil matrix. The fungus transforms P AHs to quinones that can polymerize rapidly.8

8.6.3 Compost Bioreactors
Composting is one of the most promising reactor systems for hazardous soil 
treatment. However, soil composing can be employed to treat soils con-taminated by a variety of organic pollutants, such as PAHs, explosives, and pesticides. Composting can reduce the amount of extractable PAHs by stimu-lating biodegradation or binding of intermediate(s) to organic matter in soil. A compost bioreactor has been evaluated to enhance the removal of benzo[ a]pyrene in contaminated soils by the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  (McFarland et al., 1992). The fungal system removed about 
45% of the initial benzo[ a]pyrene. The inﬂ  uence of compost bioaugmentation 
is also subject to removal of benzo[ a]pyrene in contaminated soil using P. 
chrysosporium  (McFarland and Qiu, 1995). The removal efﬁ  ciencies were 
62.8 ± 5.9 and 65.6% ± 1.2% for fungal amended and unamended systems. In “Toxic

8.6.4 Miscellaneous Bioreactors
Pilot-scale constructed wetlands are employed to treat PAH-contaminated 
water, and the role of fungi in these ecosystems has been examined (Giraud et al., 2001). A total of 40 fungal species belonging to 24 genera were identi-ﬁ ed from a contaminated wetland and a control wetland. Assay on liquid 
medium indicated efﬁ  cient degradation of ﬂ  uoranthene by 33 species and 
removal of 70% of anthracene by two species. New species included Absidia
cylindrospora ,Cladosporium sphaerospermum , and Ulocladium chartarum ,
which degrade high percentages of ﬂ  uoranthene and anthracene. No correla-
tion exists between the extracellular phenol oxidase activity and the degrada-tive ability of fungi.
8.7 PAH DEGRADATION BY FUNGAL ENZYMES
Enzyme treatment provides a new strategy for the removal of PAHs in waste-
waters and soils. The number of P AHs degraded by fungal enzymes contin-ues to increase with ongoing research. White-rot Basidiomycetes are recognized to produce a complex inventory of enzymes, especially peroxi-dases. Certain white-rot fungi produce manganese–peroxidase (MnP) and laccase in the absence of lignin–peroxidase (LiP). White-rot fungi exhibiting this pattern include Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  ( R u t t i m a n n  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 2 ;  
Ruttimann-Johnson et al., 1994), Phlebia brevispora  ( R u t t i m a n n  e t  a l . ,  
1992), Panus tigrinus  (Maltseva et al., 1991), Rigidoporus lignosus  (Galliano 
et al., 1991), Stereum hirsutum , and Ganoderma valesiacum  (N e ru d  e t  al. ,  
1991). Some fungi contain both types of enzymes, whereas others have one or the other. Most species express peroxidases and laccases as several iso-zymes (Lobos et al., 1994; Thurston, 1994; Johansson and Nyman, 1996; Munoz et al., 1997; Mester and Field, 1998). The glycosylated nature of both types of ligninolytic enzymes increases the stability of the enzymes. Nie et al. (1999) investigated the stability of recombinant and native peroxidases from Phanerochaete chrysosporium . One-electron oxidation by these 
enzymes produced cation radicals of the contaminants. Spontaneous chemi-cal reactions such as C-C cleavage of hydroxylation of cation radicals resulted in the formation of more hydrophilic products (Hammel, 1995). Assimilation of these products and cometabolism in the presence of a suitable carbon source led to the formation of CO
2 by these fungi. The mechanism of action 
of these enzymes occurs due to a complex process of oxidation, reduction, methylation, and hydroxylation. Despite the ongoing research during the past decade, the oxidative mechanisms of these enzymes in PAH degradation are not clearly understood.PAH DEGRADATION BY FUNGAL ENZYMES 311312 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
8.7.1 Peroxidase-Catalyzed Degradation
The extracellular peroxidases LiP and MnP can cleave several PAHs in vitro. 
LiP and MnP differ from each other in the range of reducing substrates. A compound as a substrate for LiP is determined by two factors: the size of the molecule and its redox potential. Little is known on the size of the compounds oxidized by LiP, for two reasons: nonconﬁ  rmation of the binding site(s) for 
reducing substrates and difﬁ  culty in the determination of kinetic parameters. 
Banci et al. (1999) tried to overcome these problems by employing a phenolic tetramer model compound.
LiP exhibits a higher redox potential than other peroxidases, suggesting 
a better oxidant of PAHs. However, all PAHs cannot be degraded by LiP. LiP is found to oxidize P AHs with an ionization potential (IP) of less than about 8 eV in the presence of H
2O2 or H 2O2-generating enzyme systems. In 
addition, compounds I and II differ in their ability to oxidize PAHs. Com-pound I can oxidize substrates of higher redox potential than compound II. The ﬁ  rst, more recalcitrant substrate can be oxidized by the addition of a 
secondary substrate. The addition of veratryl alcohol (VA), a common secondary metabolite produced by white-rot fungi along with LiP (Jensen et al., 1994), enhances the rate and extent of PAH degradation (Vazquez-D uh al t  e t  al . ,  1 994;  G o o d win  e t  al . ,  1 99 5 ).  V A  m e di a t e s  wi t h  LiP  t o  f o rm  cation radicals that react with the PAH. The oxidized V A cation may react with H
2O2, producing a highly reactive dioxygen anion, which in turn reacts 
with the substrate. In other words, VA is an ideal reducing substrate for compounds I and II. Removal of PAHs becomes more efﬁ  cient as the VA 
cation radical provides the oxidizing power of the active site to distant targets. Substrate-binding sites and catalysis and mediation by LiP and MnP have been discussed (Cameron et al., 2000; Mester and Tien, 2000). Table 8.3 lists the rates of degradation of PAHs and metabolic products by fungal peroxidases.
Limited knowledge is available on the successful oxidation of PAHs in 
vitro by MnP. MnP is unique, as it prefers its reducing substrate to be com-plexed Mn(II). It is established that MnP oxidizes Mn(II) to the powerful oxidizing agent Mn(III). A variety of PAHs are oxidized with IPs < 7.8 eV to 
acetoxy-PAH and PAH quinones by Mn(III) in acetate–water mixtures. A high yield of PAH quinones is recovered when incubated with extracellular ﬂ uids of white-rot fungi containing high levels of MnP (Field et al., 1992). 
One-electron oxidations of several P AHs by Mn(III) have been established, suggesting the role of MnP of P. chrysosporium  in the degradation of PAHs 
in vivo (Field et al., 1993).
Small amounts of quinone products from anthracene and benzo[ a]pyrene 
are produced during MnP/Mn(II) reactions by Phanerochaete laevis  (Bogan 
and Lamar, 1996). MnP-based lipid peroxidation reactions revealed transfor-mation of all four PAHs. Highly polar metabolites similar to diphenic acid (Moen and Hammel, 1994) are found during such reactions of phenanthrene, TABLE 8.3 Peroxidase-Catalyzed Degradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Metabolic Products

benz[ a]anthracene, and benzo[ a]pyrene. Accumulation of anthraquinone 
occurs during o xidation of an thracene. MnP le v els in P. laevis , like several 
other white-rot fungi, are strongly affected by the concentration of Mn(II) in the culture medium. This appears to be due to regulation at the level of mRNA transcription, a phenomenon revealed with the mnp  genes of P. 
chrysosporium  (Brown et al., 1990). Substantial losses of 12 three- to six-ring 
P AHs occurred during cultures and MnP-mediated lipid peroxidation reac-tions of P. chrysosporium  (Bogan and Lamar, 1995). This suggests the par -
ticipation of a one-electron oxidant stronger than LiP or Mn(III) in both systems. The oxidative cleavage of phenanthrene to diphenic acid by P. chrys-
osporium  is a result of peroxidase-mediated lipid peroxidation (Hammel 
et al., 1992). A cascade of reactions producing numerous radical species during lipid peroxidation has been recognized (Buettner, 1993). Fluorene transforms to 9-ﬂ  uorenone in vitro in a system containing Mn(II), unsatu-
rated fatty acids, and using P. chrysosporium  p e r o x i d a s e s  o r  b y  p u r i ﬁ  ed 
recombinant MnP (Bogan et al., 1996a). The degradation of ﬁ  ve individual 
PAHs and mineralization by MnP crude preparation of Nematoloma frowar-
dii (1.96 U/ml) at 24ºC have been demonstrated (Sack et al., 1997c). GSH is 
considered important for the degradation of certain PAHs with an IP >
7.55 eV. A possibility exists for the role of other “thio” compounds in the MnP-mediated oxidation of aromatic substrates. GSH-mediated reactions revealed enhanced mineralization of all PAHs. [
14C]Pyrene samples showed 
the highest amount of 14CO 2 release. This seems to be the ﬁ  rst report on the 
enzymatic mineralization of PAHs. Paszczynski et al. (1985) reported the oxidation of GSH by the puriﬁ  ed MnP of P. chrysosporium . This reaction 
produced H
2O2, used by MnP to oxidize PAHs. The role of H 2O2 to enhance 
anthracene degradation by Bjerkandera  sp. strain BOS55 has been demon-
strated (Kotterman et al., 1996).
One way to improve the dissolution rates of these compounds is by the 
use of surfactants. Combined treatment by Tween 80 and glucose oxidase of the extracellular ﬂ  uid of 6-day-old Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS55 cultures 
revealed elevated daily rates of oxidation of anthracene and benzo[ a]pyrene 
of 1450 and 450 mg/l, respectively (Kotterman et al., 1998a). PAHs were degraded in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids in the form of Tween 80, MnP, and Mn(II) (Moen and Hammel, 1994; Kapich et al., 1999). However, the role and mechanism of these additives in MnP catalysis are still unknown.
8.7.1.1 Role of Miscible Solvents.  PAH solubility can be increased in 
water–solvent mixtures. The oxidation of anthracene can be enhanced in the presence of cosolvent using Bjerkandera  sp. strain BOS55 (Field et al., 
1995a). Solvent additions of 6 to 21% (v/v) acetone or ethanol increase anthra-cene oxidation (98 to 99.5%) to anthraquinone three times more than at 3% solvent. Anthraquinone formation is 4 to 12 times faster at 20% solvent than at 3% solvent.Peroxidases are well known for their high tolerance to miscible solvents. 
This property can be exploited in the use of transformation of PAHs, as these compounds are solubilized in solvent–water mixtures. Ligninolytic peroxi-dases are known to tolerate 10 to 40% (v/v) miscible solvents. VA is oxidized by LiP isozyme H1 of P. chrysosporium  in 30% and 40% (v/v) 2-methyletha-
nol and 2-propanol at 30% and 20% of the control rate, respectively. MnP isozyme H4 from P. chrysosporium  exhibited normal activity in 40% (v/v) 
2-pr opan ol (Hamme l e t al., 1993). P AH compo unds w er e o xidized in vi tr o by LiP in the presence of miscible compounds such as 10 to 30% tetrahydro-furans, dioxane, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, or 2-propanol (Hammel et al., 1986; Vazquez-Duhalt et al., 1994). LiP and MnP from extracellular ﬂ  uid 
of 5-day Bjerkandera  sp. strain BOS55 cultures and semipuriﬁ  ed preparations 
from P. chrysosporium  were used for their tolerance to miscible solvents and 
in vitro conversion of anthracene in solvent–water mixtures (Field et al., 1996b). MnP assayed with 2,6-dimethoxyphenol showed 20% retention of normal activity in the presence of 45 to 58% ( v/v ) acetone, 31 to 34% ( v/v ) ethanol, and 29% (v/v) 2-propanol. LiP assayed with VA were two to three times less tolerant than MnP to solvents. This was the ﬁ  rst report of H
2O2-
enhanced degradation of anthracene by MnP in the presence of 40% (v/v) acetone. MnP also oxidized anthracene in the absence of exogenous H
2O2 at 
a lesser rate at acetone concentrations from 5 to 60%. The optimum acetone concentration is 10% (v/v) for LiP-mediated oxidation of anthracene. The toxicity of solvents to LiP increases in the preferential order 2-methoxyetha-nol < methanol < ethanol < acetone < 2-propanol. Biotransformation by MnP 
is several times slower than the dissolution kinetics in 40% (v/v) acetone. The toxicity of solvents to MnP increases in the preferential order 2-propanol <
ethanol < acetone.
8.7.1.2 Inﬂ  uence of Cyclodextrins.  PAHs can be solubilized in organic 
solvents, but these are generally not compatible with enzyme activity. Cyclo-dextrins can be employed for PAH solubilization instead of solvents. The most common forms are α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins containing six, seven, and 
eight glucose units, respectively. These can result in the formation of inclu-sion complexes with water-insoluble compounds by attaching these molecules to their hydrophobic activity. High concentrations of 2-hydroxypropyl- β-
cyclodextrin (hp βCD) were incorporated in water-insoluble 1,1 ′-dimethylfer-
rocene and tetrathiafulvalene. The solubility of naphthalene and benzo[ a]pyrene was enhanced by hp βCD about 224 and 7500 times, respec-
tively (Male et al., 1995). A distinct correlation exists between PAH solubility and hp βCD in terms of aromatic rings in the PAH. LiP oxidation of cyclo-
dextrin-included substrates is similar to that reported by Hammel et al. (1986) and Haemmerli et al. (1986) for mixed solvent systems. Of several PAHs, LiP oxidizes only anthracene, pyrene, and benzo[ a]pyrene complexed with 
hpβCD. The hp βCD solubilizes PAHs better than solvent systems using LiP 
for the oxidation of PAHs.PAH DEGRADATION BY FUNGAL ENZYMES 315316 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
8.7.2 Laccase-Catalyzed Degradation
Laccases are copper-containing proteins that catalyze the oxidation of a large 
variety of aromatic and nonaromatic compounds. Laccases catalyze one-electron oxidations with the formation of radicals that undergo subsequent nonenzymatic reactions. Laccase is considered to oxidize only compounds that have a low redox potential. Oxidation of numerous PAHs without a reac-tive functional group by laccase is rather astounding. Extracellular laccases from submerged cultures of strains of Coriolus versicolor ,Panus tigrinus ,
Phlebia radiata , and P. tremellosa  and cultures of strains of P. tigrinus ,P. 
radiata , and Agaricus bisporus  on wheat straw during solid-state fermentation 
have been puriﬁ  ed (Leontievsky et al., 1997). Laccases from submerged cul-
tures are blue in color and exhibit characteristic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, and those of solid-state fermentation are yellow-brown and exhibit atypical EPR spectra and no blue oxidase spectra. Blue and yellow-brown forms of laccases show high homology based on N-terminal amino acid sequences.
In recent years, fungal laccases have been reviewed a number of times. The 
enzymology and electron transfer mechanism of laccases have been described (Messerschmidt, 1993; Solomon et al., 1996). Messerschmidt (1997) edited a book on laccases that contained a series of articles on laccase kinetics, mecha-nisms of action, and the role of these enzymes. Insights into the molecular m e c h ani s m s  o f  co p p e r  p r o t e in s  c an  b e  g ain e d  b y  s p e c t r o s co p i c  t e c hni q u e s  (Solomon et al., 1998; Randall et al., 2001). Genes for numerous laccases have been cloned and the sequences deposited in the appropriate gene register. The occurrence, catalysis, and applications of laccases in bioremediation have recently been discussed (Mayer and Staples, 2002). Despite good research during the last decade, little is known as to the kinetic properties of fungal laccases. The precise mechanism of laccases in the degradation of PAHs is still not understood. Laccase-mediated degradation of PAHs and metabolic products is noted in Table 8.4.
Laccase of Trametes versicolor  o x i d i z e d  m o s t  o f  1 4  P A H s  i n  v i t r o  
(Majcherczyk et al., 1998). 1,2-Acenaphthenedione and 1,8-naphthalic acid anhydride were detected during oxidation of acenaphthylene with laccase of T. versicolor  (Johannes et al., 1998). Only 35% of anthracene was trans-
formed stoichiometrically to 9,10-anthraquinone after 72 hours of incubation in vitro by laccase of T. versicolor  (Johannes et al., 1996). Crude preparation 
of laccase of T. versicolor  oxidized nearly 24% anthracene after 24 hours 
(Collins et al., 1996). Puriﬁ  ed laccase isozymes laccase I and II from T. 
versicolor  also displayed a limited amount of oxidation. The major product 
of anthracene oxidation in these reactions was anthraquinone. Nearly 0.35 and 0.44 per mole of anthracene was removed by LiP and MnP of P. chryso-

conducted in a bench-scale reactor (Rama et al., 1998) containing a 2-L buffer supplemented with Tween 20 and 2,2 ′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-
sulfonate) (ABTS). Acetone was used as a solvent for benzo[ a]pyrene. 
Laccase was added and incubated at 30ºC for 24 hours with light stirring by a continuous bubble of air. All experiments were performed in 10-ml reaction tubes with a buffer (Johannes et al., 1996, 1998; Majcherczyk et al., 1998). Samples of laccase and PAH dissolved in acetone were added to each tube. Mediators dissolved in acetone were then added. Reaction tubes were tightly closed and incubated on a horizontal shaker at room temperature for a speci-ﬁ ed period of time. All experiments were performed in 2-ml reaction volumes 
in 30-ml serum bottles containing laccases in different forms (Collins et al., 1996). Laccase titer is adjusted by dilution with buffer. PAHs are dissolved in acetone, and Tween 60 is added to increase PAH bioavailability. Mediators are also added and bottles are ﬂ  ushed with 100% oxygen for 5 minutes and 
incubated for 24 hours at 27ºC.
8.7.2.2 Inﬂ  uence of Mediators.  Application of laccases in the presence 
of mediator compounds has been established to enhance the degradation of PAHs. These are low-molecular-weight compounds that result in high and novel oxidation capacities. Laccase–mediator systems were originally devel-o p e d  t o  o v e r c o m e  p r o b l e m s  o f  b i o b l e a c h i n g  o f  w o o d  p u l p s .  AB T S  a c t s  a s  a cooxidant that can interact with laccase to accomplish electron transfer. ABTS is chemically oxidized in two steps via ABTS
+ and ABTS2+ with 
respective redox potentials of 0.68 and 1.09 V (Scott et al., 1993). VA, anisyl alcohol, and benzyl alcohol can be better oxidized by ABTS
2+ than by ABTS+
(Bourbonnais et al., 1998; Majcherczyk et al., 1999). Moreover, the catalytic 
formation of ABTS2+ by laccase is unknown at present. ABTS acts as a media-
tor in a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction such as ABTS+ cation radical 
+ VA ↔ ABTS + V A cation radical (Majcherczyk et al., 1999).
Three metabolites, benzo[ a]pyrene 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-quinones in a 2 : 1 : 1 
ratio, are produced during transformation of benzo[ a]pyrene by puriﬁ  ed 
laccase of Pycnosporus cinnabarinus  in the presence of ABTS (Rama et al., 
1998). Addition of ABTS stimulates the oxidation of anthracene highly by two puriﬁ  ed laccase isozymes of T. versicolor , and ABTS is essential for the 
oxidation of benzo[ a]pyrene (Collins et al., 1996). Anthraquinone is identi-
ﬁ ed as a major metabolite of isozyme oxidation of anthracene. This type of 
one-electron mechanism appears to be similar to being catalyzed by LiP from P. chrysosporium  in the oxidation of anthracene (Hammel et al., 1991). 
Pleurotus eryngii  degrades benzo[ a]pyrene only in the presence of medi-
ators (Rodriguez et al., 2004). Nearly 70% degradation of benzo[ a]pyrene 
occurs in the presence of HBT; however, ABTS provides 60% degradation. Puriﬁ  ed laccase from a strain of Coriolopsis gallica  oxidized ﬂ  uorene in the 
presence of HBT and ABTS without the formation of oxidation products (Bressler et al., 2000). Laccase of T. versicolor  removed acenaphthene and PAH DEGRADATION BY FUNGAL ENZYMES 319320 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
acenaphthylene completely in the presence of HBT after 70 hours (Johannes 
et al., 1998). Several metabolic products have been identiﬁ  ed by oxidation of 
a laccase–HBT system. Radical cations were produced during the primary step in the oxidation of acenaphthene and acenaphthylene. 1,2-Acenaph-thenedione (XII) and 1,8-naphthalic acid anhydride (XIII) were major metabolites and constituted 50% of the metabolites obtained after 70 hours. The pathway for the oxidation of acenaphthene and acenaphthylene by a laccase–HBT system is shown in Figure 8.9.
Addition of HBT to the reaction mixture causes almost complete elimina-
tion of acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, ﬂ  uorene, anthracene, benzo[ a]pyrene, 
and perylene by laccase of T. versicolor  (Majcherczyk et al., 1998). Stoichio-
metric transformation of ﬂ  uorene to 9-ﬂ  uorenone was obtained similar to 
oxidation of anthracene to 9,10-anthraquinone. Laccase–HBT oxidation of [
14C]benzo[ a]pyrene results into three main products of quinones: 1,6-, 
3,6-, and 6,12-benzo[ a]pyrene-diones. Electrochemical oxidation of 
benzo[ a]pyrene also produced the formation of three similar quinones (Jeftic 
and Adams, 1970). T. versicolor  produced a heat-stable natural factor of 
≤10 kDa that plays a role in the laccase-mediated oxidation of anthracene 
(Collins et al., 1996). At present, the role of this natural mediator compound in the laccase-mediated degradation of PAHs is not clear. Majcherczyk and Johannes (2000) studied coupling of pyrene–polyethylene glycol (5000) in a laccase-mediator system. Substrate and laccase were separated by a mem-brane to prevent direct contact. Laccase oxidized the low-molecular-weight mediators HBT and ABTS to radicals that permeated the membrane and reacted with the pyrene–polyethylene glycol model compound. This resulted in two main oxidation products, and the same products are produced in a reaction without a membrane.
8.7.3 Miscellaneous Enzymes
Chloroperoxidase (CPO) from Caldariomyces fumago  is the most versatile 
halogenating enzyme in the hemoprotein family (Yi et al., 1999). CPO is able to perform a broad range of chemical reactions. It is a H
2O2-dependent chlo-
rinating enzyme and catalyzes peroxidase-, catalase-, cytochrome P450-type reactions of dehydrogenation, H
2O2 decomposition, and oxygen insertion, 
respectively. CPO from C. fumago  utilized 17 of 20 aromatic hydrocarbons 
as substrates in the presence of H 2O2 and chloride ions (Vazquez-Duhalt 
et al., 2001). The reaction rates were from 0.6 per minute for naphthalene to 758 per minute for 9-methylanthracene. The CPO-mediated reactions of aro-matic hydrocarbons resulted in the formation of mono-, di-, and trichlorinated compounds. The metabolites of acenaphthene, anthracene, phenanthrene, ﬂ uorene, and pyrene were dichloro- and trichloroacenaphthene, 9,10-
dichloroanthracene, chlorophenanthrene, dichloroﬂ  uorene, and chloro- and 
dichloropyrene, respectively. Interestingly, the recalcitrant and carcinogenic ﬁ ve- and six-ring PAHs are also substrates for CPO-mediated reactions.CH•

In addition to LiP and MnP, a third ligninolytic peroxidase, called the 
versatile peroxidase (VP), is recognized in Pleurotus  and Bjerkandera  (Ruiz-
Duenas et al., 2001). Two of these VPs have been cloned, sequenced, and characterized. VPs show the existence of several substrate oxidation sites. VP from Pleurotus eryngii  degraded 40% of benzo[ a]pyrene after 5 hours 
(Rodriguez et al., 2004). Hydrogen peroxide appeared to be a limiting factor, as the percentage of benzo[ a]pyrene did not increase after 5 hours.
8.8 CYTOCHROME P450 IN DEGRADATION OF PAHs
Cytochrome P450 is a superfamily of enzymes that plays an important role 
in the oxidation of xenobiotic compounds. Limited studies are known on fungal P450, due to difﬁ  culty in isolating active enzyme and to a low content 
in some species. In ﬁ  lamentous fungi, Aspergillus ochraceus  (Ghosh et al., 
1983), and Neurospora crassa  (Kapoor and Lin, 1984), benzo[ a]pyrene 
hydroxylase activity is induced by benzo[ a]pyrene. The use of cytochrome 
P450 inhibitors, the requirement for isolated enzyme on NADPH or cyto-chrome P450 reductase (CPR), and the incorporation of 
18O in the substrate 
are indirect evidence for the involvement of P450. Kellner et al. (1997) dis-cussed the natural P450s, catalytic sites and crystal structures, electron trans-fer, and engineering P450 by random mutagenesis and for bioremediation. Four decades of knowledge of cytochrome P450 has been summarized by Omura (1999).
Cytochrome P450 plays an important role in PAH degradation by fungi. 
Initial oxidation of PAHs by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase resulted into an arene oxide that is further catalyzed by epoxide hydrolase to form a trans -
dihydrodiol (Cerniglia, 1997). The CPR gene is isolated from two widely studied species, Cunninghamella elegans  and C. echinulata  (Yadav and 
Loper, 2000). The C. elegans  CPR gene is obtained by screening a genomic 
library using PCR and primers. The 2420-bp coding region contains two apparent introns, of 149 bp and 138 bp. Northern blot analysis indicated that the CPR gene is expressed transcriptionally in C. elegans and appears to be 
inducible by an alkane substrate, n-tetradecane. Phylogenetic comparison of 
the C. elegans  CPR deduced (710aa) indicates that it is more closely related 
to animal CPR than to yeast and plants. A 2074-bp sequence containing most of the CPR gene homolog from C. echinulata  was also isolated. Cytochrome 
P450 systems in fungi related to PAH degradation have been described by van den Brink et al. (1998). P. chrysosporium  metabolized phenanthrene 
to phenols and trans -dihydrodiols via a cytochrome-mediated reactions 
(Sutherland et al., 1991). Screening of a number of fungi from petroleum-contaminated soils identiﬁ  ed Penicillium janthinellum  a s  a  h i g h l y  p o t e n t  
species that exhibits P450-mediated biotransformation of pyrene (Launen et al., 1995). Moreover, the formation of 9-hydroxybenzo[ a]pyrene from oxida-
tion of benzo[ a]pyrene by 50% of the fungal isolates yields a different pattern of quinones, shown by ligninase of P. chrysosporium  ( H a e m m e r l i  e t  a l . ,  
1986). Screening of several saprophytic and plant pathogenic Basidiomycetes found Crinipellis stipitaria  t o  b e  o n e  o f  t h e  m o s t  p o t e n t  p yr e n e -d e g r a d i n g  
strains (Lambert et al., 1994; Lange et al., 1994; Wunder et al., 1994).
Pleurotus ostreatus  metabolizes several PAHs, similar to nonligninolytic 
fungi (Bezalel et al., 1996b, c). P. ostreatus  oxidizes phenanthrene to trans -
9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene. One atom of 
18O2 is incorporated 
in this product, and the inhibitor of P450 monooxygenase reduces the forma-tion of this product. These results show that cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is involved in an initial oxidation of phenanthrene. Laccase may be involved during the pathway of PAH products at a later stage. A microsomal and cytosolic cytochrome P450 system has been identiﬁ  ed, catalyzing hydroxyl-
ation of benzo[ a]pyrene in Pleurotus pulmonarius (Masaphy et al., 1995). 
The presence of cytochrome P450 in the mycelium of P. chrysosporium  and 
P450-mediated hydroxylation of benzo[ a]pyrene in both microsomal and 
soluble fractions have been demonstrated in vitro (Masaphy et al., 1996). A type I binding spectrum is produced by both P450 fractions on addition of benzo[ a]pyrene. Hydroxylation was NADPH-dependent and inhibited by 
carbon dioxide. The K
m value was 89 μm for microsomal P450 and 400 μm for 
cytosolic P450. The presence of PAH-degrading cytochrome P450 and exocel-lular ligninolytic enzymes in one fungus is something unique. A cytochrome P450 gene is identiﬁ  ed and cloned in P. chrysosporium by reverse transcrip-
tion (RT)-PCR using a set of degenerate primers (Kullman and Matsumura, 1997). The amino acid sequence deduced for the partial protein was com-pared to other known cytochrome P450 sequences and indicated that this is a ﬁ rst member of a new family of cytochrome P450, designated as CYP63-1A. 
Northern blot analysis suggested the expression of CYP63-1A under both nitrogen-deﬁ  cient and nitrogen-rich culture conditions.
8.9 FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PAHs IN SOILS
During the past decade, remediation has focused on biodegradation in soils 
of high-molecular-weight PAHs, which have recalcitrant properties. A critical factor in soil remediation is the temporal bioavailability of PAHs. The refrac-tory fraction of benzo[ a]pyrene increased twice within 3 months after initial 
contamination (Field et al., 1995b). More rapid degradation of contaminants was found in artiﬁ  cially or newly polluted soils than in aged contaminated 
soils. The aging of contamination reduces the bioavailability fraction that can be a ttribu ted to adsorption in micr opores and/or chang es in binding f orms (e.g., oxidative coupling reactions).
Most earlier bioremediation research employed indigenous bacteria for 
PAH degradation. Four pathways have been recognized for the bioremedia-tion of PAH-contaminated soils, depending on the soil structure, organic matter, and type of contamination or prevailing microﬂ  ora (Mahro et al., FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PAHs IN SOILS 323324 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
1994). On-site treatability and case studies on PAH degradation have been 
discussed by Wilson and Jones (1993). However, bacterial methods exhibit several drawbacks, due to problems of bioavailability in soils of heavier PAHs. One way to overcome this problem is to use white-rot fungi. These organisms produce extracellular enzymes, which can be effective with contaminants of low bioavailability and thus are beneﬁ  cial for the process of bioremediation.
The ability of several white-rot fungi to degrade a wide variety of xenobiot-
ics has been established. The unique properties of these fungi has been revealed. The degradation of PAHs by white-rot fungi has been investigated extensively under a variety of conditions in liquid cultures, but the applicabil-ity of this system in contaminated soils has also been demonstrated by several researchers. The degradation of PAHs in liquid cultures, soils, and reactors by different white-rot fungi under various experimental conditions during the 1990s has been reviewed by Canet et al. (1999). Notably, there were signiﬁ  cant 
differences between the degradation capabilities in liquid cultures, solid-state fermentations, and soil bioremediation. Dense mycelial growth and efﬁ  cient 
e nz ym e  p r o d u c t i o n  w e r e  n e c e s s a ry  t o  e l i mi n a t e  P AH s  fr o m  c o n t a mi n a t e d  soils.
Several advantages of white-rot fungal technology are known over those 
of other biological and conventional treatments. One problem when inoculat-ing contaminated soil with white-rot fungi can be competition from other strains of fungi and indigenous bacteria. Individual degradation activity between indigenous ﬂ  ora and selected fungi in soils is difﬁ  cult to estimate. 
White-rot fungi can be pregrown on a suitable solid substrate that is later used for inoculation of the contaminated soil. Synergistic degradation by white-rot fungi and bacteria can also occur in the bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soil. Protocols need to be developed to enhance the ﬁ  nal 
removal of contaminants in soil. Monitoring of 
14CO 2 production is important 
for mineralization, and toxicity assays must be incorporated into the proce-dures used to monitor the effectiveness of PAH mycoremediation. The kinet-ics of Cunninghamella echinulata  var. elegans  is credited with determining 
the degradation rates of PAH-contaminated soils related to three supplemen-tal nutrient solutions (Cutright, 1995). Table 8.5 shows the transformation of PAHs in soils by fungi.
8.9.1 Inﬂ  uence of Cosubstrates and Surfactants
To survive in soil, white-rot fungi need a substrate. However, successful deg-
radation of high-molecular-weight PAHs by white-rot fungi depends on an ample supply of a suitable carbon cosubstrate, such as wood chips and peat (Lamar and Glaser, 1994), wheat straw (Andersson and Henrysson, 1996; in der Wiesche et al., 1996; Wolter et al., 1997; Martens et al., 1999; Canet et al., 2001; Rodriguez et al., 2004; Mollea et al., 2005), rice, annual plant stems and wood (Field et al., 1995b), and bark (Eggen and Sveum, 1999). The extent of benzo[ a]pyrene degradation was improved by the use of hemp stem TABLE 8.5 Fungal Transformation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Soils

et al., 2001) and glucose and several plant-derived carbon sources (Morgan et al., 1993) were also tested. Straw was found to be the best substrate to support the colonization of soil and mineralization of benzo[ a]pyrene in soil 
by different white-rot fungi. Irpex lacteus  efﬁ ciently colonized sterile and 
nonsterile soil by exploratory mycelium from a wheat straw inoculum (Novotny et al., 2000). Trametes versicolor ,Kuehneromyces mutabilis ,Laetiporus sul-
phureus , and Agrocybe aegerita  mineralized 15.5%, 5%, 10.7%, and 3.7% of 
phenanthrene, respectively, within the same period during cultivation on wheat straw (Sack et al., 1997b). Cultivation in straw cultures revealed the mineralization of [
14C]pyrene by K. mutabilis  (6.7%), L. sulphureus  (4.3%), 
and A. aegerita  (3.3%); T. versicolor  exhibited the highest mineralization 
(34.1%). Thirteen (13) basidiospore-derived isolates of P. ostreatus  f6 strain 
were cultivated, differing in the level of production of MnP and laccase and morphological features on natural substrates (Eichlerova et al., 2000). The ligninolytic enzymes showed substantially higher activities in straw than in liquid culture.
Fish oil contains a mixture of triglycerides and other constituents and is a 
versatile and innocuous product for many applications. In certain applica-tions, biodegradable ﬁ  sh oil can be replaced by synthetic surfactants. Fish 
oil is added to spent mushroom compost and then mixed with creosote-contaminated soil (Eggen, 1999). During bioaugmentation of artiﬁ  cially con-
taminated soil in soil-slurry applications, Absidia cylindrospora  degraded 
98% of ﬂ  uorene within 288 hours (Garon et al., 2004). The native microﬂ  ora

improved the enhancement of ﬂ  uorene biodegradation during the ﬁ  rst 144 
hours. MCL also enhanced ﬂ  uorene degradation up to 80% by native micro-
ﬂ ora after 288 hours.
Some studies have also focused on artiﬁ  cially contaminated soils (Morgan 
et al., 1993; McFarland and Qiu, 1995; Andersson and Henrysson, 1996; Eggen and Majcherczyk, 1998). In P. chrysosporium , the degradation of 
xenobiotics is inhibited by nitrogen concentration above a certain level (Bumpus et al., 1985). Certain fungal species [e.g., P. ostreatus  (Majcherczyk 
and Huttermann, 1993; Morgan et al., 1993) and B. adusta  (Kaal et al., 1993; 
Kotterman et al., 1994)] also degraded xenobiotics in the presence of nitrogen. So these species can be used to remediate contaminated soil rich in nitrogen, or it is necessary to add nitrogen during the mycoremediation process. During the use of white-rot fungi for bioremediation, the availability of fungal inocu-lum is important so that it can withstand competition from native microﬂ  ora 
and subsequently, penetrate the surrounding soil. Spent mushroom culture can be advantageous for the fungal inoculum (Buswell, 1994). Another point concerns how the inoculum is applied. A comparison have been made of two different commercial sources of inoculum and the inﬂ  uence of organizing soil 
and substrate in layers or in a homogenized mix (Eggen, 1999). The ﬂ  uores-
cein diacetate (FDA) hydrolyzing and laccase activities were measured in FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PAHs IN SOILS 329330 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
soil to correlate enzyme activity in the substrate with the degradation rate of 
PAHs.
In certain cases it is important to eliminate the most easily degradable 
PAHs by stimulating bacteria before inoculation with white-rot fungi. This pretreatment may enhance subsequent degradation of the recalcitrant PAHs by white-rot fungi. In this way, extracellular enzymes can be utilized properly.

Surfactants are known to be effective in enhancing bioavailability in soils 
by increasing the dissolution rate and solubility of PAHs. Solubilization occurs above a speciﬁ  c threshold, the critical micelle concentration (CMC), 
when surfactant molecules aggregate to form micelles. Surfactants can lower the interfacial tension between the solid and aqueous phases, thereby enhanc-ing the mobilization of soil-bound PAHs. Solubilization depends on the type and dose of surfactant, surfactant–soil interactions, the hydrophobicity of PAHs, and the duration of contact between PAHs and soil. Nonionic poly-oxyethylene (POE) surfactants are found beneﬁ  cial for the bioremediation of 
PAHs. Factors such as surfactant toxicity and solubilizing efﬁ  ciency are con-
sidered in the selection of surfactants for soil bioremediation. In one study, nonionic POE surfactants inﬂ  uenced the elimination of nine PAHs in a con-
taminated soil slurry by P. chrysosporium  (Zheng and Obbard, 2001). Non-
ionic surfactants, Tween 80 and Tween 40, and the anionic surfactant sulfonol have been found to enhance the activities of ligninolytic enzymes during solid-phase fermentation of Pleurotus ﬂ  oridae  and Phellinus igniarius
(Dombrovskaya and Kostyshin, 1996). Surfactants have also been used to determine the nature of transformation products in P. ostreatus –inoculated 
soil microcosms (Bogan et al., 1999).
8.9.2 Fate of PAH Disappearance
In  fun gi,  b i od e gr a da ti o n  o f  P AHs  is  kn o wn  t o  be  th e  ma j o r  m echanism  o f  
removal from soils. Formation of nonextractable polymerized bound residues of PAHs by fungi has also been demonstrated.
8.9.2.1 PAH Degradation and Mineralization.  White-rot fungi have the 
ability to facilitate the removal of PAHs from creosote. All PAHs except heterocyclic compounds in aged creosote-contaminated soil are degraded signiﬁ  cantly by inoculation of Pleurotus ostreatus  (Eggen and Sveum, 1999). 
The pretreatments include a bark temperature fertilizer (BTF) treatment soil and a bark temperature (BT) treatment soil. Adding bark and incubating at 22ºC before inoculation causes better four-ring PAH degradation (59%) than d o e s  n o  p r e tr e a tm e n t  o r  p r e tr e a tm e n t  wi th  f e rtiliz e r .  Pr e tr e a tm e n t  wi th o u t  fertilizer addition (BT) offers almost twice the PAH degradation rates as those of pretreatment with fertilizer (BTF). In aged creosote-contaminated soil, P. ostreatus  removed benzo[ a]pyrene extensively (28%) during the ﬁ  rst 
month, and further incubation produced additional degradation of only 4 %  ( E g g e n  a n d  M a j c h e r c z y k ,  1 9 9 8 ) .  E l i m i n a t i o n  o f  a r t i ﬁ  cially added 
[
14C]benzo[ a]pyrene was higher than the aged benzo[ a]pyrene originally 
present. Benzo[ a]pyrene was eliminated in creosote-contaminated soil up to 
30%, 47%, and 94% after 1, 2, and 4 months, respectively, by P. chrysospo-
rium (Holroyd and Caunt, 1994). However, the total PAHs were lowered to 
96% after 4 months. Medium-sized polyethylene columns were employed for the degradation of PAHs in aged creosote-contaminated soil by P. ostreatus
(Eggen, 1999). Each column was a unique pile design related to substrate and soil. The experiments show variable laccase activity in soil and do not corre-late positively with the rate of degradation. Eight highly condensed unlabeled and three 
14C-labeled PAHs were degraded during solid-state fermentation 
by Pleurotus  sp. ﬂ orida (Wolter et al., 1997). High rates of degradation of 
benzo[ a]pyrene, benz[ a]anthracene, and benzo[ g,h,i ]perylene have been 
achieved. The highest degradation occurred in pyrene within the ﬁ  rst 5 weeks 
at all concentrations. In a 15-week period, Pleurotus  sp. ﬂ orida  mineralized 
53% [14C]pyrene, 25% [14C]benz[ a]anthracene, and 39% [14C]benzo[ a]pyrene 
to14CO 2 in the presence of eight unlabeled PAHs. Mineralization was inde-
pendent of the initial concentration of benzo[ a]pyrene. More than 40% wheat 
straw substrate was degraded by the fungus. Pleurotus  sp. ﬂ orida  has been 
shown to have the ability to grow from straw substrate into soil (Martens and Zadrazil, 1998). Pleurotus  sp. ﬂ orida  mineralized [
14C]heavier PAHs in soils 
(Martens et al., 1999). This reveals a great potential to degrade PAHs in sand in the presence of straw amendment without reduction in bioavailability. All four species of Pleurotus  showed a low degree of mineralization in solid-state 
cultures after 4 weeks using wheat straw (Rodriguez et al., 2004).
Soil microorganisms enhance the mineralization of [
14C]pyrene with a 
Pleurotus  sp. irrespective of the time of application (in der Wiesche et al., 
1996). The Pleurotus sp. showed high [14C]pyrene mineralization by soil 
application. Phanerochaete chrysosporium  showed synergistic behavior 
with indigenous soil microorganisms in the oxidation of low-molecular-weight PAHs in soil slurry (Zheng and Obbard, 2002a). However, the fungus enhanced the oxidation of PAHs up to 43%. Limited oxidation o f  h i g h - m o l e c u l a r - w e i g h t  P A H s  s u c h  a s  c h r y s e n e ,  b e n z o [ a]pyrene, 
dibenz[ a,h]anthracene, and benzo[ g,h,i ]perylene occurs due to low solubility 
and/or slow diffusion through contaminated soil. When PAHs are dissolved in acetone and added to cultures, the extent of PAH removal is a direct function of PAH solubility in the preferential order phenanthrene > pyrene >
benzo[ a]pyrene. On the contrary, efﬁ  cient oxidation of pyrene and 
benzo[ a]pyrene takes place in the presence of surfactant, Tween 80,

9,10-anthracene-dione and benz[ a]anthracene-7,12-dione have been identi-
ﬁ ed in soil during treatment with Pleurotus and Phanerochaete  than with 
Trametes . Breakdown of 90% and 80% of three- and four-ring PAHs, respec-
tively, occurred during treatment of PAH-contaminated soil for 2 months by P. chrysosporium  (Baud-Grasset et al., 1993).
During soil inoculation,  Kuehneromyces mutabilis  and Agrocybe aegerita
exhibited 47.7% and 38.5% rates of pyrene mineralization (Sack and Fritsche, 1997). Based on the total mineralization and bound residue formation, K. 
mutabilis  removed about 50% and 75% of pyrene in sterilized and nonsteril-
ized soils, respectively. K. mutabilis  enhanced up to 42% of pyrene removal 
compared to native soil microﬂ  ora. In organic-rich sterile soils, 12.6%, 37.9%, 
and 9.4% of ﬁ  ve PAHs were removed by groups of wood- and straw-degrad-
ing, terricolous, and ectomycorrhizal fungi, respectively (Gramss et al., 1999). Degradation of three- and four-ring PAHs was not enhanced in organic-rich nonsterile soils inoculated with wood- and straw-degrading fungi. Degrada-tion of ﬁ  ve- and seven-ring PAHs was 29 to 42% based on the optimum 
combinations of fungal species and soil type. Degradation was delayed by the same fungi in organic-poor nonsterile soil. Indigenous bacteria were killed by mycelia of Pleurotus , whereas Hypholoma and Stropharia  supported the 
development of bacteria in soil, not necessarily for PAH degradation. PAHs were degraded irrespective of their molecular size in organic-rich and wood-chip-amended soils. Phialophora alba  increased pyrene degradation by 9% 
compared to indigenous microorganisms, but pyrene metabolism was inhib-ited by the addition of glucose (Ravelet et al., 2001). Mucor racemosus  var. 
sphaerosporus  was not efﬁ  cient in freshwater sediment bioremediation with 
or without the addition of glucose, as it reduced the rate of pyrene degrada-tion by native microﬂ  ora. The ergosterol content was not correlated with 
pyrene degradation. Four white-rot fungi (i.e., P. chrysosporium ,P. ostreatus ,
C. versicolor , and Wye isolate no. 7) were shown not to be able to thrive and 
remove PAHs in highly contaminated soil, as they remained in a metaboli-cally inactive form (Canet et al., 2001). The autochthonous microﬂ  ora revealed 
the greatest potential for PAH degradation. Mineralization of [
14C]phenanthrene was 20% in nonsterile soil with native microﬂ  ora, and 
mineralization increased to 38% by the addition of P. chrysosporium  at 38ºC 
after 21 days (Brodkorb and Legge, 1992). In the presence of P. chrysospo-
rium , the proportion of soluble and bound polar compounds increased. These 
polar products are supposed to be more readily metabolized by native soil microﬂ  ora. In sterile soil, degradation activity was decreased several times by 
the addition of P. chrysosporium . Pyrene degradation was suppressed by 
P. chrysosporium , native microﬂ  ora, and other abiotic characteristics of 
soil (T ucker et al., 1995).
Irpex lacteus  removed three- and four-ring PAHs efﬁ  ciently in an artiﬁ  -
cially spiked soil after 3 months (Novotny et al., 2000). The fungus produced LiP and laccase but no MnP in sterile soil. The extracellular enzyme produc-tion and PAH in soil have been eliminated by mycelia of white-rot fungi (Novotny et al., 1999). Tube reactors are used for the cultivation of white-rot 
fungi in soil. The activities of fungal MnP and laccase are 5 to 20 times higher in coarse-milled wheat straw than in soil. The enzyme activities in P. ostreatus  and T. versicolor  are similar in soil compared to low levels in 
P. chrysosporium . Ligninolytic enzymes showed higher activities in milled 
wheat straw than in liquid culture by isolates of P. ostreatus  (Eichlerova et 
al., 2000). The ability to decompose the straw was very good after 50 days and a high loss of organic mass was attained. All seven PAHs were degraded successfully by the original P. ostreatus  strain f6 and isolates B13 and B26 
in soil samples after 15 weeks. No correlation existed between higher or lower rates of production of ligninolytic enzymes (laccase and MnP) and the extent of degradation. This suggests the involvement of some other factors i n  t h e  b i o d e g r a d a t i o n  p r o c e s s .  G r o w t h  o f  s i x  b a s i d i o s p o r e - d e r i v e d  i s o l a t e s  in nonsterile soil indicates their suitability for the exploitation in biotechno-logical research.
Isolates of the genera Mucor ,Cladosporium ,Coniothyrium ,Fusarium ,
Sphaeropsis , and Trichoderma  revealed degradation rates of aged PAH-
contaminated soil above 20% (Potin et al., 2004a). Coniothyrium  (Co) 
and Fusarium  (F5) exhibited 20%, 22%, and 30% of three-, four-, and 
six-ring PAH, respectively. Except for benzo[ b+k]ﬂ uoranthene and 
dibenz[ a,h] a n t h r a c e n e ,  h i g h - m o l e c u l a r - w e i g h t  P A H s  w e r e  d e g r a d e d  a t  a n  
average rate of 40 to 50%.
8.9.2.2 Bound Residue Formation.  PAHs are also incorporated into soil 
organic matter, resulting in the formation of bound residue formation. Some of this knowledge was discussed earlier in the section on bioreactors. Burgos et al. (1996) reported on free radical–mediated copolymerization of pollutant and/or degradation products and the organic precursors of humic and fulvic acids by extracellular fungal oxidoreductases due to covalent incorporation of pollutant into soil organic matter. This has been demonstrated in vitro for PCP (Ruttimann-Johnson and Lamar, 1996), for other chlorophenols (Sarkar et al., 1988; Lassen et al., 1994), for trinitrotoluene (Dawel et al., 1997), and for certain herbicides (Kim et al., 1997). The formation of nonextractable polymerized residues of PAH has been demonstrated by white-rot fungi in mixtures of sand and fungal-colonized straw (Wolter et al., 1997). A binding-desorption model for the humic substances for remediation has also been discussed (Rebhun et al., 1996).
Some humiﬁ  cation of anthracene, ﬂ  uoranthene, and benzo[ a]pyrene in 
two PAH-contaminated soils was shown to occur during growth by P. ostrea-
tus (Bogan et al., 1999). Signiﬁ  cant increases in the amount of radioactivity 
associated with the humic acid and humic fractions were found in benzo[ a]pyrene-contaminated soils by P. ostreatus . The removal of PAHs 
was enhanced signiﬁ  cantly in both soils by P. ostreatus  in  t h e  p r e s e n c e  o f  
surfactants and related amendments, but humiﬁ  cation was not always 
enhanced.FUNGAL DEGRADATION OF PAHs IN SOILS 333334 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
8.9.3 Factors Affecting Biodegradation of PAHs
A number of factors affect successful mycoremediation in soils. Mycodegra-
dation depends on the inherent properties of PAHs and soils. Adsorption or covalent binding of PAHs to organic carbon, such as clay minerals and their particle size, affect the bioavailability, transport, fungal activity, and myco-degradation in the environment. A number of mechanisms, such as chemical binding, hydrogen bonding, cation bridging, ion exchange, covalent bonding, ligand exchange, and van der Waals forces, may be involved in the process of sorption, although these mechanisms are not completely understood. Envi-ronmental parameters (i.e., soil moisture, pH, redox potential, oxygen, nutri-ent content, and temperature) also inﬂ  uence the rate of degradation. The 
extent of contaminant retention is related directly to the octanol–water ( K
ow)
partitioning coefﬁ  cient and the amount of organic matter in the soil. These 
parameters are usually interrelated and can be optimized to improve fungal degradation.
Different factors are known to affect the degradation of PAHs in soils by 
white-rot fungi (Boyle et al., 1998). T. versicolor  produces a range of unidenti-
ﬁ ed polar metabolites from [
14C]benzo[ a]pyrene along with low mineraliza-
tion in liquid culture. Addition of soil, sawdust, or ground alfafa to a liquid culture inhibits the formation of polar metabolites with little effect on mineralization. Nitrogen sources have little effect on the formation of polar metabolites, but inhibit mineralization. Radiolabeled polar metabolites in soil are more rapidly mineralized by soil microorganisms than by benzo[ a]pyrene. 
Degradation in soil is increased by some surfactants, thus increasing benzo[ a]pyrene concentration in the soil moisture phase. Bioremediation of 
PAH-contaminated soils with P. chrysosporium  can be improved coupled 
with the regulation of carbon, nitrogen, pH, and so on (Brodkorb and Legge, 1992).
In selected fungal experiments, Canet et al. (1999) described a tempera-
ture range 20 to 39ºC, with or without O
2 content, a 4-day to 15-week period 
of incubation, nutrient contents, cosubstrates, and surfactants in a liquid medium, artiﬁ  cially contaminated soil, and bioreactors, respectively. P. chrys-
osporium  grows very fast at an optimum temperature of 30ºC and sporulates 
easily in culture. About a 75% increase in the rate of degradation occurs during incubating the soil at 30ºC rather than at 20ºC (Field et al., 1995b). Increasing the benzo[ a]pyrene in soil from 100 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg doubles 
the initial daily rate of degradation to 21 mg/kg. Degradation of all PAH groups increases nearly 1.4- to 3.6-fold when the temperature increases from 8ºC to 22ºC (Eggen and Sveum, 1999). In general, degradation is 12 to 20% at 8ºC except for heterocyclic compounds (40%). At both temperatures, four-ring PAHs exhibit more degradation than three-ring PAHs. In general, higher degradation occurs with pretreated soil inoculated at 8ºC. Unexpectedly high rates of degradation are noted for heterocyclic compounds at 8ºC and in soil pretreated without fertilizer. A three-factor model depicted the same trend in the effect of pretreatment at 8ºC and for the interaction between pretreat-
ment and temperature. Porous pumice stones added to the soil also provide adequate aeration and high rates of degradation. Benzo[ a]pyrene degraded 
at a daily rate of 0.8 mg/kg in the presence of a 100% O
2 atmosphere when 
the soil was inoculated with P. chrysosporium  (Qui and McFarland, 1991). 
An air atmosphere was shown to be adequate for PAH degradation during the creation of rapid O
2 mass transfer from a high liquid/gas surface area ratio 
(Kotterman et al., 1994). Slightly open lids of jars were shown to ensure aera-tion of microcosm experiments (Canet et al., 2001). In each microcosm, the moisture content was maintained at 50% of the water-holding capacity, and each was incubated at 22ºC. Continuous aeration of 3 to 6 ml/min with sterile CO
2-free moistened air has been used with ﬂ  asks incubated at 25ºC (in der 
Wiesche et al., 1996; Wolter et al., 1997).
8.10 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF COMPLEX PAH MIXTURES
PAH mixtures degraded rapidly, within 4 to 8 hours, and no compound 
remained after 24 hours using C. elegans  (Pothuluri et al., 1995). About 54% 
of benzo[ a]pyrene was degraded in 4 hours, 66% by 8 hours, and complete 
degradation by 24 hours. More rapid degradation of 84% and 85% has been found in phenanthrene and ﬂ  uoranthene, respectively, in 4 hours, 95% for 
each by 8 hours, with complete degradation by 24 hours. About 88% pyrene was degraded by 4 hours, 97% by 8 hours, with complete degradation by 24 hours. Hydroxylated metabolites formed within 24 hours, exhibiting spectra similar to those of 3-(8-dihydroxyﬂ  uoranthene) β-glucopyranoside, phenan-
threne 3,4-dihydrodiol, 2-hydroxy-1-phenanthryl β-d-glucopyranoside, 
3-ﬂ uoranthene β-glucopyranoside, and 3-hydroxybenzo[ a]pyrene. These 
metabolites are similar to those formed during studies of individual PAH compounds. A Coelomycete, Cyclothyrium  sp., degrades 59%, 70%, 74%, 
and 38% of anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo[ a]pyrene, respec-
tively, in a mixture after 192 hours of incubation (da Silva et al., 2003).
White-rot fungi are also suggested for the biodegradation of complex mix-
tures containing various PAHs in crude oil–, coal tar–, and creosote-polluted sites. P. chrysosporium  has been proved to degrade all compounds in a 
mixture in creosote (Kennes and Lema, 1994). Phenol and cresol are ﬁ  rst 
eliminated, followed by PCP and the PAHs. Metabolites such as naphthoqui-none and anthraquinone accumulated. Individual PAH is degraded slightly faster at similar initial concentrations than the same compounds in the mixture. The PAH components of anthracene oil disappeared after incu-bating with P. chrysosporium  under nitrogen-limiting culture conditions 
(Bumpus, 1989).
Fungal enzymes are also used for the degradation of complex mixtures of 
PAHs. A PAH mixture was biodegraded by 1.96 U/ml MnP crude preparation of Nematoloma frowardii  in the presence of GSH within 168 hours (Sack FUNGAL METABOLISM OF COMPLEX PAH MIXTURES 335336 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
et al., 1997c). No anthracene or phenanthrene was detected after 96 
hours. More than 75% each of pyrene and ﬂ  uoranthene and more than 30% 
each of benz[ a]anthracene, benzo[ a]pyrene, and benzo[ b]ﬂ uoranthene were 
degraded. Phenanthrene disappeared due to a combination of volatilization and degradation. Chrysene was not degraded. All anthracene, 65% of pyrene, 40% of ﬂ  uoranthene, and 20% of benzo[ a]pyrene was degraded in the absence 
of GSH. Chrysene, benz[ a]anthracene, and benzo[ b]ﬂ uoranthene were not 
degraded without GSH. Selectivity of LiP to oxidize either anthracene or benzo[ a]pyrene has been demonstrated when mixed with pyrene (Male et al., 
1995). In a PAH mixture of benzo[ a]pyene and pyrene, pyrene is oxidized 
only after complete assimilation of benzo[ a]pyrene. Similarly, in a mixture 
of anthracene and pyrene, pyrene was oxidized only after complete assimila-tion of anthracene. A lag period was noted before the formation of pyrene oxidation products, which suggests a faster rate of oxidation of pyrene than for either anthracene or benzo[ a]pyrene alone.
Substrate interactions have been evaluated by biodegradation kinetics of 
naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene in sole-substrate systems and in binary and ternary mixtures (Guha et al., 1999). Aerobic batch aqueous systems inoculated with mixed culture were employed. In sole-substrate experiments, Monod kinetic parameters and yield coefﬁ  cients were calculated 
from substrate depletion and release of CO
2. The ternary mixture revealed 
the inhibition of biodegradation of naphthalene and enhancement of bio-degradation of phenanthrene and pyrene. A multisubstrate Monod kinetic model predicted substrate interactions in binary and ternary mixtures based on the parameters of sole-substrate experiments. Simulations of biomass growth kinetics throw sufﬁ  cient light on various range behaviors in PAH 
mixtures. Substrate interactions may be large due to the presence of a large number of compounds in PAH-contaminated environments. It has been shown that single, binary, and ternary PAH mixtures can be solubilized by three different anionic surfactants (Chun et al., 2002).
8.11 PAH DEGRADATION BY 
FUNGAL–BACTERIAL CO-CULTURES
Fungi and bacteria exhibit different pathways for the catabolism of PAHs. 
Both present certain disadvantages with regard to degradation of PAHs at the sites. Fungi and bacteria can be employed together or in different phases to maximize the extent of the biodegradation. Bacteria are generally unable to hydroxylate PAH compounds. Fungal transformation of PAHs, followed by bacterial degradation of polar metabolites, can be an effective strategy for PAH metabolism. Some fungal–bacterial co-cultures studies have proven its potential for the detoxiﬁ  cation and mineralization of PAHs. In one study, 
signiﬁ  cant degradation and microbial growth occurred on chrysene, pyrene, 
benz[ a]anthracene, benzo[ a]pyrene, and dibenz[ a,h]anthracene in basal salts medium (BSM) in the presence of a combination of fungal–bacterial 
co-cultures of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  VUN 10010 and a bacterial 
consortium of VUN 10009 and Penicillium janthinellum  VUO 10201 
(Boonchan et al., 2000). These co-cultures mineralized 25% of benzo[ a]pyrene 
to CO 2 after 49 days, along with temporary accumulation and disappearance 
of metabolites. Inoculation of fungal–bacterial co-cultures resulted in 53% mineralization of [
14C]benzo[ a]pyrene to 14CO 2 in 100 days. Biodegradation 
of benzo[ a]pyrene by the same fungal–bacterial co-cultures has also been 
reported by Stanley et al. (1999). P. janthinellum  was not able to utilize 
benzo[ a]pyrene on the BSM. However, 16 to 64% of the 14C label was identi-
ﬁ ed as polar metabolites in the presence of cosubstrate (i.e., pyrene, glucose 
or mal t e xtract, y east e xtract, pep tone , de xtr ose medi um ). Be nzo[ a]pyrene 
was mineralized by S. maltophilia  and bacterial consortia. Radioactive 
recovery of 13 to 32% pyrene (250 mg/l) was achieved as 14CO 2.P. janthinel-
lum and S. maltophilia  r e s u l t e d  i n  5 8 %  o f  b e n z o[ a]pyrene mineralization 
with 61% water-soluble products after 56 days on media containing pyrene (250 mg/l) and benzo[ a]pyrene (50 mg/l).
Nearly 8.5% 
14CO 2 in fungal cultures and 73% water-soluble metabolites 
was recovered from [14C]benzo[ a]pyrene after 15 days using Bjerkandera  sp. 
strain BOS55 (Kotterman et al., 1998b). Many unidentiﬁ  ed polar metabolites 
accumulated. Further incubation of up to 215 days accounts for a small increase in mineralization (13.5%). Inocula of indigenous microﬂ  ora pre-
pared from activated sludge, acid forest soil, and a culture grown on 2,2 ′-
diphenic acid, when added to fungal cultures, enhanced benzo[ a]pyrene 
mineralization by 20 to 27% by day 56. Also, the amount of polar metabolites decreased from 69% to 37–48%. Further incubation for 215 days resulted in the recovery of 34% 
14CO 2 and 16% polar metabolites. Studies by Kotterman 
et al. (1998b), Stanley et al. (1999), and Boonchan et al. (2000) resulted in signiﬁ  cant reduction in the mutagenic potential of cultures or soil extracts as 
observed in a Salmonella typhimurium  revertant assay. These studies also 
reveal that fungal oxidation can enhance benzo[ a]pyrene mineralization by 
bacteria. A similar phenomenon was also noted for pyrene (in der Wiesche et al., 1996).
Phenanthrene degradation correlates to microbial density and biomass 
increase, the highest biomass reaching 238 and 50 mg/l for Rhodotorula 
glutinis  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , respectively (Romero et al., 1998). R. 
glutinus  is as active as P. aeruginosa  during growth on phenanthrene in liquid 
mineral basal medium.
8.12 BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING
Genetically engineered microorganisms have shown potential in applications 
for bioremediation in soil, groundwater, and activated sludge environments, due to the enhanced degradative capabilities of a wide range of contaminants. BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING 337338 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
Applications of genetically engineered microorganisms have been discussed 
in bioremediation, including risk assessment for the release of recombinant microorganisms, survival in a harsh world, and bioprocess monitoring and control (Sayler and Ripp, 2000). Several hundred genetic systems can be exploited for developments useful in bioremediation (Sayler et al., 1998; Menn et al., 2000). Strains and protein engineering can be designed for improved bioremediation. Genetic alterations can be designed and controlled via meta-bolic engineering. The present limited knowledge of biotechnology related to PAHs is focused on white-rot fungi, especially P. chrysosporium , and is quite 
complex. Multiple isozymes are produced in submerged cultures, and at least 10 structural genes for LiP isozymes have been designated, from lipA  through 
lipJ in P. chrysosporium  ( G a s k e l l  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 4 ) .  L i P  i s o z y m e s  s h o w  s o m e  
kinetic and substrate range differences, but the reason for the multiplicity of lip genes is unknown at present. LiP isozymes exhibit variations based on 
kinetics (Glumoff et al., 1990). In certain isozymes, access to the heme group is less restricted, due to the ﬂ  exibility of the surrounding protein. Some of 
these variations may be due to differences in the oxidation–reduction poten-tial of the various isoforms (Millis et al., 1989) or variations in active-site structures (Sinclair et al., 1995). LiP isozyme proﬁ  les have been prepared 
from liquid culture at the level of protein (Dosoretz and Grethlein, 1991; Boominathan and Reddy, 1992) and mRNA transcripts (Stewart et al., 1992; Moukha et al., 1993).
Lamar et al. (1995) puriﬁ  ed mRNA from fungus-colonized soil with com-
petitive reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to understand the physiological state of P. chrysosporium  in soil. Transcripts of two LiP genes ( lipA and 
lipC ), two cellobiohydrolases ( cbh1-1 and cbh1-4 ), and mRNA encoding the 
mitotic spindle protein β-tubulin in PCP-contaminated soil by P. chrysospo-
rium  have been detected. Three MnP isozyme genes in P. chrysosporium
were expressed during a bench-scale PAH soil bioremediation experiment using competitive RT-PCR (Bogan et al., 1996b). The expression of three MnP genes is coordinately regulated under growth conditions. The degrada-tion of ﬂ  uorene and disappearance of chrysene in soil during an early phase 
of fungal colonization correlated with the degree of expression of MnP genes in P. chrysosporium .
The constant oxidation of anthracene that occurred throughout a 25-day 
experiment suggested the involvement of several LiP isozymes of P. chryso-
sporium  (Bogan et al., 1996c). The mRNA from soil was extracted for the 
expression of 10 lip genes in anthracene-transforming soil cultures and quan-
tiﬁ cation of lip mRNA by competitive RT-PCR. The levels of extractable lipA
transcript and protein LiP H8 were well correlated. An unusual pattern of gene expression was observed. The early phase of fungal growth was domi-nated by lipA  and lipD . Transcripts of lipJ reached the highest levels with any 
gene during later stages of growth. The high levels of lipA  mRNAs were 
maintained for 3 weeks and outnumbered transcripts of several other lip
genes (i.e., lipB,lipG ,lipH , and lipJ) throughout the study. The gene expres-sion of lip under different liquid conditions suggests an early phase of carbon 
limitation, followed by a transition to nitrogen starvation. Thus, anthracene transformation occurs by mechanisms different from those involved in the oxidation of non-LiP substrate PAHs.
8.13 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Over the past two decades, extensive knowledge has been developed on the 
b i o d e g r a d a t i o n  o f  P A H s  b y  f u n g i ,  e s p e c i a l l y  b y  w h i t e - r o t  f u n g i .  I n  s o i l  systems, fungi have demonstrated their ability to degrade two- or three-ring PAHs faster, but their activity to degrade PAHs with four or more fused rings is limited. In general, two- or three-ring P AH compounds have half-lives on the order of days rather than months or years for ﬁ  ve- or higher fused ring 
PAHs. Thus, it is important to screen, isolate, and apply fungi that can degrade high-molecular-weight PAHs faster in ﬁ  eld soils.
Fungal degradation of PAHs has been achieved successfully in bioreactors 
despite limited work. However, methods to remove toxic materials and improve PAH bioavailability and biodegradation need to be developed to make mycoremediation more effective. Good controls are required to mini-mize abiotic losses. Factors controlling fungal acclimatization to maintain prolonged activity in bioreactors are yet to be determined. The limited biotreatment of exogenous enzymes in mycodegradation of PAHs has been recognized with good success. High titers of LiP and MnP activities in white-rot fungi are necessary to carry out the mineralization of PAHs. The ability to produce highly active radicals and H
2O2 in the presence of mediators by 
Nematoloma frowardii  MnP indicates the possibility of using this method in 
t h e  b i o r e m e d i a t i o n  o f  s o i l s ,  s e d i m e n t s ,  o r  w a s t e w a t e r s  c o n t a m i n a t e d  w i t h  high-molecular-weight PAHs (Sack et al., 1997c). Natural mediators can be discovered and used to amplify the reactions of MnP.
The use of white-rot fungi in soil bioremediation of PAHs is an exciting 
and promising technology. However, it is still difﬁ  cult to formulate a protocol 
for the design of the mycoremediation system. Pleurotus sp. Florida is pro-
posed as a promising candidate for soil bioremediation because of its ability to degrade highly condensed PAHs, its high tolerance to substrates, and a large capacity for competing with indigenous soil microﬂ  ora (Wolter et al., 
1997; Martens and Zadrazil, 1998; Martens et al., 1999). Irpex lacteus  is also 
considered as a suitable fungus for soil remediation, due to the production of different ligninolytic enzymes, robust growth, its ability to colonize soil, and its resistance to the inhibitory action of soil microﬂ  ora (Novotny et al., 2000). 
A better understanding of the microbial ecology of white-rot fungi in highly contaminated ﬁ  eld soils is important before the development of mycoremedia-
tion strategies. The Heterobasidiomycetes and Hyphomycetes are involved in a natural selection process in PAH-contaminated habitats (Kurtzmann and Fell, 1998). PAH oxidation can be optimized by indigenous fungi in designing CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 339340 FUNGAL METABOLISM OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
improved techniques for the bioremediation of contaminated soils. Factors 
controlling PAH bioavailability and mycodegradation and their optimization are also necessary to enhance mycoremediation in ﬁ  eld soils. A possib-
ility exists for the use of P. chrysosporium  to treat highly naphthalene-
contaminated soil in a landfarming process (Mollea et al., 2005).
At present, targets for cleanup of PAH contamination by fungi are not 
clear. Complete removal by fungi of PAHs in contaminated soils is not known. The formation, mechanism, and removal of nonextractable residues from PAH during fungal biodegradation and humiﬁ  cation in soils are important 
issues for the future. The fate and toxicity of PAH carbon skeletons integrated in humic substances are yet to be determined.
In recent years, the use of fungal–bacterial co-cultures has demonstrated 
the detoxiﬁ  cation of PAHs. Such studies have opened new horizons on the 
processes of fungal biodegradation. Bioaugmentation is one approach to soil bioremediation and has been used on a contaminated site when not enough of the appropriate microorganisms are present. To date, studies on the role of fungal bioaugmentation at PAH-contaminated sites are unknown. No doubt, fungal–bacterial co-cultures and bioaugmentation are employed to overcome limited metabolic capabilities, but these also suffer from certain limitations. Little is known on the biodegradation of complex mixtures of PAHs by fungi. The preferential oxidation of one PAH over the other in a mixture will be a topic of great interest in the future.
Despite extensive work on fungal detoxiﬁ  cation of the PAHs, the meta-
bolic pathways have not been fully elucidated. The principal types of metabo-lites are identiﬁ  ed and the search continues. Mycodegradation and toxicity of 
the oxidation products of PAHs and their interactions with the soil matrix open new vistas of future research. An understanding of metabolic pathways and metabolites is crucial to the development of successful strategies for mycoremediation in soils. Extensive research on the enzymes involved in metabolic pathways is necessary to optimize the process of biodegradation by fungi. Genes encoding enzymes involving degradation of high-molecular-weight PAHs must be cloned, sequenced, and characterized. The development of selective bioengineered fungi can open a new era in PAH metabolism.

FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION 
AND DECOLORIZATION OF PULP AND PAPER MILL EFFLUENTS
9.1 INTRODUCTION
The pulp and paper industry is one of the primary users of wood resources 
in the world. The purpose of pulping is to extract cellulosics from plant mate-rials and from hard- or softwood trees. At present, three approaches are known to produce pulp from wood: mechanical pulping, chemical pulping, and a combination of both mechanical and chemical pulping. Mechanical pulping provides higher yields and causes less pollution than chemical pulping. The main drawback of mechanical pulping is low-quality pulps, unsuitable for high-strength ﬁ  ber products and high energy requirements. Chemical 
pulping involves dissolving lignin from cellulose and hemicellulose ﬁ  bers. 
This is known as the Kraft process , in which wood chips are cooked in a solu-
tion containing sodium hydroxide and sodium sulﬁ  de. In this process, less 
than 50% yields are achieved and the pulp requires extensive bleaching. The Sulﬁ te process  uses sulfur compounds for pulping, and this pulp requires less 
bleaching than is required by the Kraft process. Conventional pulp bleaching involves a variety of chlorine species as bleaching agents. During chlorina-tion, wood components such as lignin and some carbohydrates are oxidized and degraded. This is followed by an alkaline extraction phase, which trans-forms the oxidized products to a soluble form. The ﬁ  nal bleaching is per-
formed by oxidizing agents: chlorine dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. All these processes are of environmental concern, due to disposal of the spent chemicals.

Pulp and paper plants are one of the most polluting industries in the world. 
In India, more than 150 paper and board mills were in operation (Subraman-yam, 1990); of these, 36 were large mills with a production capacity of >55 
tons/day, and the others were small mills with a production capacity of <30 
tons/day (Sastri, 1986). Nearly 175 m
3 of wastewater per ton of manufactured 
paper is produced by the pulp and paper industry. The bleach plant efﬂ  uents 
are of greatest concern, as they release high amounts of chlorinated organics from the chlorine bleaching. One of the main constraints on efﬂ  uent dis-
charge is the color, which varies from light tan to deep brown to black. One ton of pulp produces about 100 kg of color-generating compounds and 2 to 4 kg of organochlorines to the bleach plant efﬂ  uents (Nagarathnamma et al., 
1999). Efﬂ  uents from the alkali extraction stage exhibit 80% of the color, 
30% of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and 60% of the chemical o x y g e n  d e m a n d  ( C O D )  o f  t h e  m i l l  p o l l u t i o n ,  i r r e s p e c t i v e  o f  l o w  v o l u m e  (Prasad and Joyce, 1991).
These efﬂ  uents cause acute and chronic toxicity. The chlorinated organics 
in the spent bleaching liquor also show mutagenic qualities (Pacheco and Santos, 1996). The low-molecular-weight chlorolignin fraction contributes to the efﬂ  uent BOD and acute toxicity, and the high-molecular-weight chlori-
nated compounds contribute to the efﬂ  uent color, COD, and chronic toxicity. 
Color inhibits the natural process of photosynthesis and adversely affects the productivity of the aquatic ecosystem. The end results of the discharge of these efﬂ  uents include bioaccumulation in ﬁ  sh to the point of impairment 
of ﬁ sh quality and diversity in water bodies and various disorders in ﬁ  sh. 
R e g u l a t o r y  a g e n c i e s  h a v e  s e t  u p  l i m i t s  t o  r e d u c e  o r  e l i m i n a t e  t h e s e  s u b -stances completely in discharges. In Scandinavia and North America, chlorine bleaching in pulp mills has been stopped in compliance with regula-tions on adsorbable organic halides (AOX). The U.S. government has imposed a total ban on AOX discharges, whereas a discharge of up to 1.5 kg of AOX per ton of cellulose pulp is allowed in various parts of Europe (Taseli and Gokcay, 1999). However, chlorine is still used in some pulp plants in Europe and India, due to the low cost and the superior quality of the paper. In India, a few mills use chlorine dioxide for viscosity protection during the ﬁ  rst bleaching stage and for brightening during the ﬁ  nal bleaching 
stage. Oxidative extraction and peroxide bleaching are also known in some mills.
9.2 DISTRIBUTION AND STRUCTURE OF LIGNIN
Lignin is a widely distributed and extremely insoluble polymer that provides 
resistance to microbial attack. It constitutes up to 30% of softwood and 20% of hardwood in the cell walls of Gymnosperms and Angiosperms in associa-tion with cellulose and hemicellulose polysaccharides. Lignin is next to cel-lulose in the global carbon cycle of the biosphere and is the most abundant material in terms of energy content. Hemicellulose and lignin bind together 
through cross-links, and the cellulose ﬁ  bers provide strength.
Lignin is a highly irregular amorphic three-dimensional chemically 
complex aromatic heteropolymer of para -hydroxyphenyl propane units linked 
through many C—O—C and C—C bonds. The molecular weight of puriﬁ  ed 
lignin ranges from a few thousand to 106 Da; in vivo lignin has a molecular 
weight of 105 Da or more. Lignin is randomly synthesized from coniferyl, para -
coumaryl, and sinapyl alcohol precursors (Figure 9.1). These three precursors differ in the number of methoxy groups on the aromatic ring. The content of these precursors varies in different plant species as well as in different tissues of the same plant. Softwood lignin contains coniferyl and para -coumaryl 
alcohol precursors, and hardwood lignin contains a sinapyl alcohol precursor. Grass and cereal lignin contain covalently bound para -hydroxycinnamic acids 
(i.e., para -coumaric and ferulic acids) in addition to the three primary precur-
sors. Lignin cannot be degraded anaerobically and the C—C and ether bonds joining subunits must be cleaved by an oxidative mechanism. Kirk and Brunow (1988) polymerized the lignin precursors in vitro to produce synthetic lignin o r  d e h y d r o g e n a t i v e  p o l y m e r i z a t e  ( D H P ) .  D H P  i s  f r e e  o f  c a r b o h y d r a t e s ,  soluble in some solvents, and can be labeled with 
14C or 13C. DHP is exploited 
extensively for lignin biodegradation research, despite smaller and varying frequencies of interunit linkages.
An attempt has been made to build a three-dimensional model of lignin 
structure using a computer program (Jurasek, 1995). The simulated process follows three-dimensional packing of the subunits, and the branched oligo-meric structures forms the cross-links. Interchain cross-linking joins the oligomers into one macromolecule and intrachain cross-links result in closed loops. This can result in a macromolecule of molecular weight 3.8 × 10
5 with 
an internal density of 1.35 g/cm3. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) 
images of DHP demonstrate a highly ordered process of ligniﬁ  cation, even 
during in vitro conditions, and this contributes to our understanding of the structure of lignin (Radoticacute et al., 1994).

9.3 LIGNIN-DEGRADING MICROORGANISMS
In nature, lignin degradation is a slow process and takes a number of years. 
Bacteria, actinomycetes, yeasts, and fungi are known to be involved in lignin degradation. Microbial degradation of lignin has been discussed by many researchers (Garg and Modi, 1999; Blanchette, 2000; Hatakka, 2001).
9.3.1 Bacterial Degradation
Much is not known regarding the degradation of lignin by bacteria. Pure 
culture studies on bacterial deligniﬁ  cation are virtually absent because bac-
teria cannot grow on cellulose and lignin together. However, certain species of bacteria (e.g., Aeromonas ,Arthrobacterium ,Flavobacterium ,Pseudomo-
nas, and Xanthomonas ) have the ability to degrade lignin (Amer and Drew, 
1980; Crawford and Crawford, 1980). Species of Pseudomonas  are the most 
efﬁ cient degraders of lignin (Vicuna, 1988; Zimmerman, 1990). Nonﬁ  lamen-
tous bacteria mineralize less than 10% of synthetic lignin and can metabolize the low-molecular-weight portion of lignin and the degradation products of lignin (Ruttimann et al., 1991; Vicuna et al., 1993). Lignin degradation by thermophilic and anaerobic bacteria has not been demonstrated. Alkali lignin was utilized as the sole source of carbon from sulfate wastewater by species of Corallina ,Torula ,Nocardia , and Pseudomonas (Marchand, 1978). 
About 98% industrial kraft lignin degrades as the sole carbon source after 5 days of cultivation by Aeromonas  s pp .  (Desc ham ps  e t  al. ,  1 980).  Cy an o-
bacteria also plays an important role in the removal of lignin from paper mill efﬂ  uents (Bharti et al., 1992). Mixed cultures of bacteria, actinomycetes, 
and fungi in soil and compost can also mineralize lignin (Tuomela et al., 2000).
9.3.2 Fungal Degradation
Fungi are the only microorganisms studied extensively for the degradation of 
lignin. Lignin degradation by fungi has been discussed by a number of researchers (Evans and Hedger, 2001; Hatakka, 2001). Based on the nature of decay, the wood-rotting fungi are classiﬁ  ed in three categories: soft-rot, 
brown-rot, and white-rot fungi. Soft-rot decay, caused by a number of molds of Ascomycetes and Imperfect Fungi, is known to degrade the major compo-nents of wood, including lignin (Blanchette, 1995; Daniel and Nilsson, 1998). Fungi causing soft-rot decay include species of Allescheria ,Graphium ,Mono-
dictys ,Paecilomyces ,Papulospora , and Thielavia . Two types of soft rot are 
recognized: Type I consists of cavities formed within secondary walls, and type II relates to an erosion form of degradation. Better degradation of lignin by these fungi occurs in hardwood than in softwood. Xylariaceous Ascomy-cetes belonging to the genera Daldinia ,Hypoxylon , and Xylaria  are now 
grouped in type II. These fungi occur on hardwood, and 53% of the weight loss in birch wood occurred within 2 months by Daldinia concentrica  (Nilsson 
et al., 1989). The soil fungi Penicillium chrysogenum ,Fusarium oxysporum ,
and Fusarium solani  mineralized 27.4%, 23.5%, and 22.6% of 14C-labeled 
lignin, respectively, from milled wheat straw within 4 weeks (Rodriguez et al., 1996a). Another soil fungus, Fusarium proliferatum , mineralized 3.5% 
of 
14C-(ring)-labeled DHP and 10% of [14Cβ] DHP in 30 days (Regaldo et al., 
1997). Fusarium proliferatum  secreted aryl alcohol, and laccase in liquid 
cultures (Regaldo et al., 1999). Penicillium chrysogenum  secreted laccase and 
mineralized 7.9% of [14Cβ] DHP in 29 days (Rodriguez et al., 1996b). A nearly 
20% weight loss occurred in pine wood in 3 months by Chrysonilia sitophila ,
with carbohydrate and lignin losses of 18% and 25%, respectively (Rodriguez et al., 1997). Analysis of decayed lignin indicates oxidative C
α–C β and β-O-
aryl bonds cleavage during lignin degradation. A strain of Thermoascus 
aurantiacus  degraded extracts of Eucalyptus grandis  and bleached Eucalyp-
tus kraft pulps (Machuca et al., 1998).
Brown-rot fungi include several species of Basidiomycetes and are most 
common in softwood. These fungi remove cellulose and hemicellulose from the wood, leaving the lignin as a crumbly brown residue. This is due to lignin demethylation, partial oxidation, and depolymerization. The brown color shows the presence of modiﬁ  ed lignin in wood. Lignin can be degraded in 
softwood and hardwood by these fungi. All brown-rot fungi employ a Fenton-type catalytic system, producing hydroxyl radicals that attack wood compo-nents, but there are certain differences in wood decay. Based on the differences in the mechanism, brown-rot fungi are classiﬁ  ed into two groups: one belong-
ing to Gloeophyllum trabeum  and the second including Coniophora puteana
and Poria  (Postia )placenta .Gloeophyllum trabeum  accumulates oxalic acid, 
which can be used for the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and as a chelator for a Fe(II)–H
2O2 system generating hydroxyl radicals (Shimada et al., 1997). In 
one study, cultivation of G. trabeum  on pine wood ﬂ  akes under optimized 
conditions led to a 30% release of 14CO 2 from 14C-methylated lignin in 52 days 
(Jin et al., 1990). Poria placenta  demethoxylated spruce lignin, but there was 
no ring opening (Davis et al., 1994).
The only and most effective lignin degraders and/or mineralizers are the 
white-rot fungi or closely related litter-decomposing fungi, which include several hundred species of Basidiomycetes and a few Ascomycetes. These fungi are able to decompose hardwood more extensively than softwood and completely mineralize lignin and carbohydrate components of wood to CO
2
and water. Lignin and carbohydrates can be removed at the same propor-tional rate by some species of white-rot fungi. Selective species of other white-rot fungi remove lignin faster than cellulose. Many white-rot fungi colonize cell lumina, thus causing cell wall erosion. As decay progresses, the eroded areas coalesce and void areas ﬁ  lled with mycelia are formed. This process is 
known as nonselective orsimultaneous rot ;Trametes versicolor  belongs to 
this category. Some white-rot fungi decompose lignin without loss of cellulose and create white-pocket rot; Phellinus nigrolimitatus  belongs to this category. LIGNIN-DEGRADING MICROORGANISMS 361362 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
Ganoderma applanatum  and Heterobasidion annosum  produce both types 
of attack in the same wood (Eriksson et al., 1990). Litter-decaying Basidio-mycetes, such as the genera of Stropharia  and Agrocybe , mineralized only 
half of the 
14C-(ring)-labeled DHP than by wood-inhabiting white-rot fungi 
(Steffen et al., 1999). Seven white-rot fungi (i.e., T. versicolor ,Daedalea 
ﬂ avida ,Dichomitus squalens ,Phlebia fascicularia ,P. ﬂ oridensis ,P. radiata ,
and Phanerochaete chrysosporium ) exhibited a 12 to 25% loss of lignin in 
wheat straw after 32 days (Arora et al., 2002). All fungi produced LiP, MnP, and laccase except Daedalea ﬂ  avida  and Dichomitus squalens , which lack LiP 
and MnP, respectively.
White-rot fungi occur more commonly on wood species of Angiosperms 
t h a n  o n  G y m n o s p e r m s  ( G i l b e r t s o n ,  1 9 8 0 ) .  S y r i n g y l  u n i t s  a r e  d e g r a d e d ,  whereas guaiacyl units are more resistant to degradation. Transmission elec-tron microscopy has revealed partial removal of the middle lamella by Ceri-
poriopsis subvermispora  and Pleurotus eryngii  and removal of lignin from 
secondary cell walls by Phlebia radiata  (Burlat et al., 1998). In recent years, 
more taxonomically diverse fungi have been studied for lignin degradation. In general, it has been found that the physiological process of lignin degrada-tion is fungus-speciﬁ  c and is different from Phanerochaete chrysosporium .
Differences may be related to the taxonomic position and ecology of fungi. Ganoderma lucidum  p r o d u c e s  MnP  i n  p o p l a r  w o o d  b u t  n o t  i n  p i n e  w o o d

9.4 FUNGAL LIGNIN-DEGRADING ENZYMES
In nature, white-rot fungi are the predominant degraders of lignin, as these 
fungi contain speciﬁ  c genes for the enzymes necessary for depolymerization 
of lignin. These enzymes include lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxi-dase (MnP), laccase, and hydrogen peroxide–generating enzymes. Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are also produced and are considered agents of wood decay by fungi. These enzymes are produced in different combinations, sug-gesting more than one strategy for biodegradation of lignin. The oxidation of phenolic compounds to phenoxy radicals takes place via lignin-degrading enzymes and oxidation of nonphenolic compounds via cation radicals. Based on the pattern of enzyme production, Hatakka (1994) classiﬁ  ed the white-rot 
fungi into three major categories: (1) the lignin–manganese peroxidase group (e.g., Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and Phlebia radiata ), (2) the manganese 
peroxidase–laccase group (e.g., Dichomitus squalens  and Rigidoporus ligno-
sus), and (3) the lignin peroxidase–laccase group (e.g., Phlebia ochraceofulva
and Junghuhnia separabilima ).
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  has been studied extensively as a model of 
lignin biodegradation research and production of LiP. Many researchers have recently discussed the oxidative mechanisms, molecular genetics, and applica-tions of a variety of ligninolytic enzymes. A hypothetical mechanism of lignocellulose transformation by enzymes of white-rot fungi has been 
described by Leonowicz et al. (2001).
9.4.1 Lignin Peroxidases
Lignin peroxidase (LiP; EC 1.11.1.14) was discovered in Phanerochaete chrys-
osporium  (Glenn et al., 1983; Tien and Kirk, 1983) and has become the most 
thoroughly studied peroxidase. LiPs are produced by most white-rot fungi, such as Phanerochaete ﬂ  avido-alba  ( B e n  H a m m a n  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 9 ) ,  Trametes 
trogii  (Vares and Hatakka, 1997), Bjerkandera  sp. strain BOS55 (ten Have et 
al., 1998), Phlebia ochraceofulva  (Vares et al., 1993), and Phlebia tremellosa
(Vares et al., 1994). Several isozyme forms have been detected in P. chryso-
sporium  cultures and a number of other white-rot fungi (e.g., Trametes versi-
color ,Bjerkandera adusta ,Phlebia radiata ). The activity and number of LiP 
isozymes produced by P. chrysosporium  vary from 2 to 15, depending on the 
strain, age of the culture, medium composition, and method of cultivation. LiP activity has not been detected in cultures of all three marine fungi (Raghukumar et al., 1996) or in one of the most active and widely studied biopulping fungus, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora .
LiPs are glycosylated heme proteins secreted during secondary meta bolism 
in nutrient-limited cultures. LiPs have a molecular weight of about 40 kDa, a low optimum pH of 2.5 to 3.0, acidic pIs, and a high redox potential. The three-dimensional crystal structure of LiP at 2 to 2.5 Å has also been estab-lished (Piontek et al., 1993; Poulos et al., 1993). The substrate binding site of LiP has not been determined with certainty. The crystal structure indicates the heme access channel to be the substrate binding site. The catalytic cycle of LiP is similar to that of other peroxidases. LiP catalyzes the H
2O2-depen-
dent oxidation of a variety of lignin model compounds in three steps (Marti-nez, 2002):
resting peroxidase [Fe
3+ · porphyrin] + H 2O2
→ compound I [Fe4+= O · porphyrin•+]+ H 2O
compound I [Fe4+= O · porphyrin•+]+ S
 →  compound II [Fe4+= O · porphyrin•+]+ S•
compound II [Fe4+= O · porphyrin] + S
 →  resting peroxidase [Fe3+ · porphyrin] + S•+ H 2O
In these reactions, S stands for “substrate” (e.g., veratryl alcohol, β-O-4 lignin 
dimer, or other lignin substructure). Other fungal enzymes may provide H 2O2
for LiP activity. White-rot fungi produce H 2O2-generating oxidases such as 
glucose oxidases, glyoxal oxidase, and aryl-alcohol oxidase as part of the lig-ninolytic system. White-rot fungi that lack H
2O2-generating oxidases employ 
organic acids such as oxalate and glyoxylate, which produce H 2O2 indirectly. FUNGAL LIGNIN-DEGRADING ENZYMES 363364 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
The catalytic cycle of LiP is shown in Figure 9.2 (ten Have and Teunissen, 
2001).
LiP is relatively nonspeciﬁ  c for reducing substrates, as it reacts with a wide 
range of lignin model compounds and even unrelated compounds. LiPs can oxidize the cleavage of β-O-4 linkages, C
α–C β linkages, and other bonds in 
lignin and its model compounds and are also involved in benzyl alcohol oxida-tions, side-chain cleavages, ring-opening reactions, demethoxylations, and oxidative dechlorination. Table 9.1 lists some examples of LiP-mediated deg-radation of lignin. LiP can depolymerize 
14C-methylated lignin (Tien and 
Kirk, 1983) and synthetic lignin, but polymerization occurs simultaneously (Hammel et al., 1993). LiP is unable to oxidize lignin to CO
2 in a cell-free 
system. The mechanism of LiP action on lignin is still unclear, and it is also not certain that the enzyme can oxidize lignin directly or requires certain radicals, such as VA. LiP has the ability to oxidize ferrocytochrome c (12 300 Da), suggesting its action directly on polymeric lignin (Wariishi et al., 1994). Site-directed mutagenesis shows the presence of Trp in LiP isozyme 
H8 that is essential for activity toward VA, as two mutants with different amino acids do not exhibit this activity. Two distinct substrate interaction sites in LiP H8 seem to be present in both mutants (Doyle et al., 1998). A reso-nance mirror biosensor indicates the speciﬁ  c binding of LiP to synthetic lignin 
(DHP) (Johjima et al., 1999). It appears that a speciﬁ  c amino acid is respon-
sible for lignin binding. V A and nonphenolic β-O-4 dimeric lignin compound 
can act as reductants for LiP L3 from Phlebia radiata  (Lundell et al., 1993a, 
b). VA plays various roles in the ligninolytic system of P. chrysosporium . VA 
is related to H
2O2 production in the ligninolytic system of Pleurotus eryngii
(Guillen and Evans, 1994). Compounds such as 3,4-dimethoxytoluene, 1,4-
HO - 2 H22-O 2

366dimethoxybenzene (1,4-DMB), 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl alcohol, and 2-Cl-1,4-
DMB have been found to substitute the function of VA as a cofactor of LiP (Koduri and Tien, 1994; Joshi and Gold, 1996; Teunissen and Field, 1998).
LiP is a large molecule that penetrates plant cell walls. It appears that 
exposed regions of the lumen are attacked by LiP to achieve direct degrada-tion. More research is required, but some studies present evidence of degrada-tion of lignin from inside cell walls. Kirk and Cullen (1998) hypothesized on the ability of cell walls to penetrate low-molecular-weight diffusable com-pounds by LiP, which can oxidize lignin due to indirect oxidation. Oxidation reactions of lignin model compounds catalyzed by LiP have been described by ten Have and Teunissen (2001). This includes the degradation of model compounds accounting for 7% and 50 to 60% of the linkages in lignin.
LiP genes have been characterized in P. chrysosporium  (de Boer et al., 
1987; Asada et al., 1988). Several LiP genes have also been characterized from other species of fungi, including four Trametes versicolor  clones: LPG1 
(Jonsson and Nyman, 1992), LPGII (Jonsson and Nyman, 1994), VLGI (Black and Reddy, 1991), and Bjerkandera adusta  cl ones LPO- 1 ( Asada e t 
al., 1992) and Phlebia radiata lpg3  (Saloheimo et al., 1989). LiP-like sequences 
appear to be present in the genomes of Fomes lignosus  (Huoponen et al., 
1990) and Phlebia brevispora  and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  (Ruttiman 
et al., 1992). In P. chrysosporium , LiPs are encoded by a family of at least 
10 closely related genes, designated lipA  through lipJ (Gask e ll e t al., 1994; 
Cullen, 1997; Steward and Cullen, 1999). LiP genes show a high degree of sequence conservation. Also, multiple peroxidase genes have been found in species of Pleurotus  and Ceriporiopsis  (Lobos et al., 1998; Ruiz-Duenas et 
al., 1999a; Camarero et al., 2000; T ello et al., 2000). The number of introns in genes encoding LiP are eight to nine for P. chrysosporium  and ﬁ  ve to six 
for T. versicolor  ( M a r t i n e z ,  2 0 0 2 ) .  M a t u r e  p r o t e i n  l e n g t h s  o f  L i P s  o f  B. 
adusta ,P. chrysosporium ,T. versicolor , and P. radiata  reveal 349, 342 to 344, 
338 to 346, and 337 amino acids, respectively. LiP isozymes from P. chryso-
sporium  and T. versicolor  are related in group III. Putative regulatory ele-
ments in the promoter regions of P. chrysosporium  include xenobiotic response 
elements (XREs) and cAMP-mediated response elements in LiP genes (Gold and Alic, 1993).
Despite the detection of lip-like gene sequences, Eggert et al. (1996a) 
reported polymerization of lignin preparations rather than polymerization during LiP testing in vitro. Expression of 10 structurally similar LiP genes, lipA  through lipJ, in three linkage groups has been quantiﬁ  ed relevant to 
biopulping (Janse et al., 1998). In contrast to several studies, this investigation focuses on gene expression in wood rather than on cultural conditions. This also demonstrates that the induction of lipD  is due to carbon starvation, and 
that of lipA ,lipC , and lipJ is due to nitrogen limitation. Genes such as lipD 
and lipE are not involved actively in biopulping. The crystal structure of LiP 
proteins resembles that of cytochrome c oxidase. The overall patterns of lip
transcripts are different from those of media. Transcript levels from solid FUNGAL LIGNIN-DEGRADING ENZYMES 367368 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
substrates exhibit no correlation with intron structure, genomic organization, 
or amino acid sequence familarity (Stewart and Cullen, 1999). Variation of g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  f r o m  s t r a i n  t o  s t r a i n  o c c u r s  d u r i n g  L i P  r e g u l a t i o n  i n  P.

Heterologous expression of LiP is more difﬁ  cult than expression of laccase. 
LiP from P. chrysosporium  is expressed for the production of apoenzyme in 
inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli  with low yields (Doyle and Smith, 1996; 
Nie et al., 1998). A homologous expression system of LiP H8 of P. chryso-
sporium  has been developed under the control of gpd promoter (Sollewijn 
Gelpke et al., 1999).
9.4.2 Manganese Peroxidases
Manganese peroxidase (MnP; EC 1.11.1.13) is secreted in multiple forms in 
microenvironments by white-rot fungi and certain soil litter–decomposing fungi. A list of 56 fungi that produce MnP in liquid and/or solid-state fermen-tation has been compiled by Hofrichter (2002). MnP is secreted by a distinct group of Basidiomycetes, such as the families Coriolaceae, Meruliaceae, Polyporaceae, and the soil litter families Strophariaceae and Tricholomata-ceae. The molecular weight of MnP ranges between 38 and 62.5 kDa, and the molecular weight of the most puriﬁ  ed MnP is 45 kDa. About 11 isozymes of 
MnP are known to be produced by Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  (Lobos 
et al., 1994; Urzua et al., 1995). Five isozymes in P. chrysosporium  MP-1 have 
been detected to date (Kirk and Cullen, 1998). Like LiP, nitrogen-deﬁ  cient 
conditions favor the production of MnP.
MnP is also glycosylated heme-containing extracellular peroxidase. Its 
catalytic cycle is similar to those of LiP and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), but it uses absolute Mn(II) as a substrate that is widespread in lignocellulose and soil. MnP has a lower redox potential than LiP and is different from other peroxidases, due to the structure of the binding site. Two calcium ions main-tain the structure of the active site (Banci, 1997). A catalytic cycle is initiated by binding H
2O2 or an organic peroxide to the native ferric enzyme, forming 
an iron–peroxide complex, as depicted in Figure 9.3 (Hofrichter, 2002). Per-oxide oxygen–oxygen bond cleaves producing MnP compound I (Fe
4+-
oxo-porphyrin-radical complex). Subsequent reduction takes place through MnP compound II (Fe
4+-oxo-porphyrin complex), and Mn(II) oxidizes to 
Mn(III), and this continues with the generation of native enzyme and release of the water molecule. MnP compound I is similar to LiP and HRP and can be reduced by electron donors such as ferrocyanide, phenolics, and Mn(II), whereas MnP compound II is very slowly reduced by other substrates and requires Mn(II) for completion of the catalytic cycle (Wariishi et al., 1988). A high concentration of H
2O2 causes re v ersible inactivation of MnP 
by forming compound III, an inactive state. Hybrid forms of MnP and LiP are also known which can oxidize phenolic and nonphenolic compounds. These enzymes are recognized in Bjerkandera  sp. strain BOS55 (Mester and Field, 1998), Bjerkandera adusta  (Heinﬂ  ing et al., 1998a, b), and Pleurotus 
eryngii  (Martinez et al., 1996; Heinﬂ  ing et al., 1998b). The crystal structures 
and molecular models of MnP of P. chrysosporium  (Sundaramoorthy et al., 
1994), C. subvermispora  (Canales et al., 1998; Tello et al., 2000), and P. 
eryngii  (Heinﬂ  ing et al., 1998b; Camarero et al., 2000) are known based on 
gene sequences. Crystal structures of substrate binding site mutants of MnP in P. chrysosporium  at 2.06 Å resolution reveal the presence of only one major 
Mn binding site (Sundaramoorthy et al., 1997). A revision in molecular biology and the structure–function relationship of MnP has been advocated (Gold et al., 2000).
One-electron oxidation of various substrates can occur by chelates of 
Mn(III) with organic acids. Chelates of Mn(III) and organic acids react with each other, forming alkyl radicals which undergo spontaneous reactions with dioxygen, producing other radicals, such as superoxide (Hatakka, 2001). These radicals, generated by autocatalytic reactions, appear to be the source of peroxides and can be employed by MnP in the absence of H
2O2. An MnP 
system can oxidize organic sulfur-containing cooxidants (e.g., glutathione, l-
cystein), unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives, linoleic acid, and Tween 80 to reactive thiyl and peroxyl radicals. These radicals can attack lignin structures in the presence of dioxygen.Mn3

A reaction system containing MnP from P. chrysosporium , sodium malo-
nate, Mn(II), and H 2O2 catalyzes C α oxidation, C α–C β cleavage, and alkyl 
aryl cleavages of phenolic syringyl type β-1 lignin structures (Wariishi et al., 
1989; Tuor et al., 1992). Phenolic substructures are oxidatively cleaved and comprise only a small portion of the total aromatic structures in lignin. Table 9.1 shows some examples of MnP-mediated degradation of lignin. A hypo-thetical pathway for MnP-catalyzed formation of CO
2 from aromatic lignin 
structures is shown in Figure 9.4 (Hofrichter, 2002). Increased depolymeriza-tion of lignin preparations occurs using both MnP and laccase from Rigido-
porus lignosus  (Galliano et al., 1991), MnP and laccase from Agaricus 
bisporus  (Bonnen et al., 1994), MnP and LiP from P. chrysosporium  (Thomp-
son et al., 1998), and LiP, MnP, and laccase (Martinez-Ingio and Kurek, 1997). A similar approach to the combination of MnP with other extracellular enzymes of white-rot fungi, such as cellobiose dehydrogenase, can be used in the future.
Nonphenolic substructures are abundant in lignin, although unable to 
undergo oxidation through direct attack by Mn(III)-chelates. Mediators or cooxidants generate reactive radicals which can oxidize such structures. Glu-tathione oxidizes VA and nonphenolic β-O-4 lignin model dimers, produc-
ing, in aryl ether, cleavage of the dimers. MnP from Phlebia radiata  cleaves 
the nonphenolic β-O-4 lignin model dimer and catalyzes the mineralization 
of synthetic lignin in a cell-free system (Kapich et al., 1999a). An MnP–lipid p e r o x i d a t i o n  s y s t e m  i s  s t r o n g  e n o u g h  t o  d e g r a d e  C
α–C β and β-aryl ether 
bonds in nonphenolic lignin model dimers (Kawai et al., 1995; Kapich et al., 1999b). Lipid peroxidation of unsaturated lipid formed lipoxyradical inter-mediates in the presence of Mn(II) that can oxidize nonphenolic model lignin compounds (Kirk and Cullen, 1998). C. subvermispora  produced ben-
zylic fragments from β-O-4 lignin structures due to MnP lipid-mediated 
peroxidation in the absence of LiP activity (Jensen et al., 1996). DNA sequence and protein crystallographic examinations reveal the close similar-ity of MnPs to LiPs. MnP is regulated by the carbon and nitrogen levels in P. chrysosporium . In addition, transcription of MnP genes occurs in the 
presence of Mn(II), whereas Mn(II) does not regulate mnp3  genes in  P. 
chrysosporium and C. subvermispora  (Gettemy et al., 1998; Tello et al., 
2000). Transcription of different MnP isozymes exhibits variable dependen-cies in the presence of Mn(II) (Gettemy et al., 1998). In Pleurotus , proteins 
with MnP activity are present in cultures lacking Mn(II), and the addition of Mn(II) inhibits the production of MnP (Martinez et al., 1996). MnP gene sequences and cDNA have been cloned and sequenced, including Trametes 
versicolor  (Johansson et al., 1993; Johansson and Nyman, 1996), Pleurotus 
ostreatus  (Asada et al., 1995a; Giardina et al., 2000; Irie et al., 2000), Ceri-
poriopsis subvermispora  (Lobos et al., 1998; T ello et al., 2000), Dichomitus 
squalens  (Li et al., 1999), and Ganoderma applanatum  (Maeda et al., 2001). 
One MnP encoding gene was found grouped within a 10-kb region in T. versicolor  ( J o h a n s s o n  a n d  N y m a n ,  1 9 9 6 ) .  M a t u r e  p r o t e i n  l e n g t h  s h o w s  OCH 3

differences between the MnP of C. subvermispora  and D. squalens  (364 to 
369 amino acids) and the MnP of P. chrysosporium  (357 to 358 amino acids). 
The sequence afﬁ  nity indicates that eight isozymes from P. chrysosporium ,
C. subvermispora , and D. squalens  are clustered together in group I (Mar-
tinez, 2002). Potential transcription control elements are identiﬁ  ed in 5 ′-
untranslated regions of MnP genes, and reporter genes can be constructed that conﬁ  r m  t h e s e  p u t a t i v e  r e g u l a t i n g  e l e m e n t s  ( G o d f r e y  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 4 ) .  
Responses from a MnP promotor and applications in determining conditions for optimal MnP gene expression from certain loci have been demonstrated. Putativ e regulatory elemen ts in the promoter region of a P. chrysosporium
gene-encoding MnP contain both metal response (MRE) and heat-shock response (HSE) elements (Alic et al., 1997). Heterologous expression of MnP in alternate hosts is more difﬁ  cult to obtain than LiPs. MnP of P. chryso-
sporium  and the P. eryngii  MnPL2 have been produced successfully as active 
proteins in various species of Aspergillus  (Stewart et al., 1996; Ruiz-Duenas 
et al., 1999b; Conesa et al., 2000).
9.4.3 Laccases
Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.2) are widely dis-
tributed in many white-rot Basidiomycetes. They are also found in higher plants and in several fungi belonging to Ascomycetes and Deuteromycetes. They are involved in lignin degradation and also serve other functions: in fungal pigmentation, pathogenicity, fructiﬁ  cation formation, sporulation, and 
detoxiﬁ  cation.
Laccases are blue glycosylated multi-copper-containing oxidases that are 
larger than peroxidases and have a molecular weight of 60 to 80 kDa. Laccases contain four coppers per enzyme and are of three different types: type I, type II, and type III. Each type has a distinct role in the oxidation of laccase sub-strates. Laccases have an optimum pH between 3.0 and 5.7, but some laccases of soil-inhabiting Basidiomycetes have pH optima of 7.0. The optimum tem-perature is as high as 75ºC for the laccase of the litter-decomposing fungus Marasmius quercophilus  (Dedeyan et al., 2000). Laccases exhibit signiﬁ  cant 
differences in redox potential (Messerschmidt, 1997). Three types of laccases are classiﬁ  ed based on differing redox potential (Eggert et al., 1998). The 
crystal structure of laccase from Coprinus cinereus  i s  r e s o l v e d  a t  2 . 2  Å  
(Ducros et al., 1998). Laccase from C. cinereus  expressed in Aspergillus 
oryzae  has been crystallized and its cartoonlike 3-D structure has been deter-
mined (Ducros et al., 2001).
Laccases can catalyze four single-electron oxidation of phenolic com-
pounds, aromatic amines, and other compounds, coinciding with reduction of molecular O
2 to H 2O. Laccase catalyzes alkyl phenyl and C α–C β cleavage 
of phenolic β-1 and β-O-4 lignin model dimers and demethylation of several 
lignin model compounds. Laccase is not the key enzyme in lignin degrada-tion, as lignin contains only 10 to 15% phenolic structures in spruce, pine, and aspen wood (Lai, 1992). Recently, laccase has shown good ability for 
lignin barrier breakdown in lignocellulose (Leonowicz et al., 2001). Trametes 
versicolor  is one of the most efﬁ  cient laccase-producing fungi. Laccases are 
also produced in conjunction with LiP , MnP , or both. Laccases from marine fungi effectively mineralized 
14C-(ring)-labeled synthetic lignin to 14CO 2
(Raghukumar et al., 1996). Co-cultivation of white-rot fungi Cerrena maxima
and Coriolus hirsutus  revealed the oxidation of a phenolic component of 
lignin under static and shaken conditions in media with birch sawdust and sulfonate lignin and under solid-state fermentation with birch sawdust (Koroleva et al., 2002). In addition, C. maxima  produced three laccase iso-
zymes during growth on these media.
Limited use of laccases in lignin degradation is due to size limitations, as 
it cannot diffuse into pulp ﬁ  bers. To circumvent these limitations, the use of 
mediators is postulated. The mediator compounds are also found to enhance the oxidation potential of laccase to nonphenolic moieties of lignin. Common mediators are 2,2 ′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) and 
1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT); less common mediators are polyoxometalate (POM) and N-hydroxyacetanilide (NHA). The use of laccase in the presence 
of mediators to oxidize lignin and delignify kraft pulp is well established (Table 9.2). Many aspects of laccases, including the role of mediators in del-igniﬁ  cation, have been covered by Argyropoulos (2001).
Neither LiP nor MnP is secreted by Pycnosporus cinnabarinus ; the only 
laccase produced is that essential to lignin degradation (Eggert et al., 1996a). P. cinnabarinus  produces a metabolite as a naturally occurring redox media-
tor [i.e., 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3-HAA)] for the degradation of nonphenolic lignin and synthetic lignin by laccase (Eggert et al., 1996b). P. cinnabarinus
appears to be a model system to study alternative strategies for lignin biodeg-radation. This is the ﬁ  rst evidence of a system equivalent to ligninolytic 
system based on LiP or MnP and the ﬁ  rst description of the function of 
laccase in the complete depolymerization of lignin.
L a c c a s e s  a r e  p r o d u c e d  a b u n d a n t l y  b y  Trametes versicolor  during pulp 
bleaching, and at least three forms can be isolated (Paice et al., 1989). Each form binds differently to pulp (Addleman and Archibald, 1993). At least two laccase isoforms (Ruttimann et al., 1992), four or ﬁ  ve isozymes (Lobos et al., 
1994), and two isozymes, L1 and L2 of laccases (Fukushima and Kirk, 1995) in Ceriporiopsis subvermispora , and two laccase isozymes, I and II in T. ver-
sicolor  (Bourbonnais et al., 1995), have been detected. At least seven laccase 
isozymes have been identiﬁ  ed in the white-rot isolate I-62 (Mansur et al., 
1997). One of the laccase isozymes from Pleurotus ostreatus  shows activity 
inside the cell or in the cell wall (Palmieri et al., 2000). Two laccase isozymes of Coriolopsis rigida  participate in the production of oxygen free radicals, 
suggesting their role in the process of lignin degradation (Saparrat et al., 2002).
Several amino acid sequences of laccases have been established. The simi-
larity is about 20 to 60%. Conserved copper-binding sites are found in every FUNGAL LIGNIN-DEGRADING ENZYMES 373TABLE 9.2 Laccase-Catalyzed Deligniﬁ  cation of Lignin

374laccase. Based on gene expression, two types of laccases have been distin-
guished: constitutive and inducible. Copper, 2,5-xylidine, veratric acid, and so on, induce laccase at the level of transcription and translation (Bollag and Leonowicz, 1984; Palmieri et al., 2000). The most effective inducer of laccase is 2,5-xylidine (Leonowicz et al., 2001). More than 17 laccase genes have been cloned and sequenced from different white-rot fungi (Kirk and Cullen, 1998). These include ﬁ  ve genes from Trametes villosa  (Yaver et al., 1996), four from 
Rhizoctonia solani (Wahleithmer et al., 1996), two from Agaricus bisporus
(Perry et al., 1993), and one each from Neurospora crassa  (Schilling et al., 
1992), Coriolus hirsutus  (Kojima et al., 1990), Cryphonectria parasitica (Choi 
et al., 1992),  Aspergillus nidulans  (Aramayo and Timberlake, 1990), Pleuro-
tus ostreatus  (Giardina et al., 1995), and an unidentiﬁ  ed basidiomycete (Coll 
et al., 1993). Laccase gene-speciﬁ  c sequences have been detected in brown-rot 
fungi (D’Souza et al., 1996). Sequence identity between certain pairs of lac-cases appears to be low, but conservation is high within regions involved in copper binding. Eleven introns at similar positions have been found in each of three Rhizoctonia solani  laccase genes (Wahleithmer et al., 1996). Intron 
position is conserved in the laccase genes of Trametes villosa  and other Basid-
iomycetes (Yaver and Golightly, 1996).
Laccase genes are known from at least 15 species of fungi, which includes 
22 genes of eight Basidiomycetes (Maijala, 2000). These include Ceriporiop-
sis subvermispora  (Karahanian et al., 1998), Pycnosporus cinnabarinus
(Eggert et al., 1998; Otterbein et al., 2000), several strains of Trametes versi-
color  (Jonsson et al., 1997), Lentinula edodes  (Zhao and Kwan, 1999), Cop-
rinus cinereus  ( Y a v e r  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 9 ) ,  a n d  Phlebia radiata  (Saloheimo and 
Niku-Paavola, 1991). Nearly 30 laccase genes have been cloned and integrated into various expression vectors and expressed successfully in alternative hosts (Gianfreda et al., 1999). Recombinant laccases have been expressed in indus-trial hosts such as Aspergillus oryzae  (Yaver et al., 1999) and the yeast Pichia 
pastoris  ( J o n s s o n  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 7 ;  O t t e r b e i n  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 0 ) .  H o w e v e r ,  t h e  ﬁ  rst 
cloning and recombinant laccase of Myceliophthora thermophila  was 
expressed in Aspergillus oryzae  (Berka et al., 1997).
9.4.4 Hydrogen Peroxide–Producing Enzymes
In addition to LiPs, MnPs, and laccases, the white-rot fungi produce a variety 
of oxidases (e.g., glucose-1-oxidase, glucose-2-oxidase or pyranose-2-oxidase, glyoxal oxidase, methanol oxidase, veratryl alcohol oxidase). These are sources of H
2O2 and are utilized by peroxidases during the degradation of 
lignin. Glucose-1-oxidase and glucose-2-oxidase play an important role in the ligninolytic system of P. chrysosporium  by producing H
2O2.
Veratryl alcohol (VA) is a secondary metabolite produced by P. chryso-
sporium  under nitrogen-limited conditions in parallel with the onset of LiP 
production. VA also acts as a substrate and stimulates ﬁ  vefold activity for LiP. 
VA increases the action of LiP on many substrates, including lignin. Nitrogen FUNGAL LIGNIN-DEGRADING ENZYMES 375376 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
h a s  n o  e f f e c t  o n  V A  p r o d u c t i o n  i n  Bjerkandera  sp. strain BOS55 (Mester 
et al., 1995). Mester et al. (1995) also showed the inhibition of V A levels by Mn(II) in both Bjerkandera  sp. strain BOS55 and P. chrysosporium . VA is 
produced via the shikimate pathway, resulting in amino acids such as l-
phenylalanine as intermediate. 
14C-Isotopic trapping experiments reveal 
cinnamate, benzoate, and benzaldehyde as the precursors of V A in P. chryso-
sporium  and Bjerkandera  sp. strain BOS55 (Jensen et al., 1994; Mester et al., 
1997). Three modes of action of VA are suggested in lignin degradation: (1) a cation radical redox mediator of remote substrates, (2) protection of LiP from inactivation by H
2O2, and (3) a preferred substrate for the second one-
electron reduction of the LiP catalytic cycle. Neither Harvey’s mediation (Harvey et al., 1986) nor Valli’s protection mechanism (Valli et al., 1990) adequately explains all the veratryl data. However, VA functions as a sub-strate for compound II, allowing for turnover of the LiP (Zapanta and Tien, 1997). In several white-rot fungi, addition of VA to the culture is found to increase LiP titers. VA can form a cation radical upon oxidation by LiP, and it mediates the oxidation of some substrates. Tryptophan can act in a similar way (Collins et al., 1997). LiP-stabilized V A cation radical can act as a strong redox mediator (Khindaria et al., 1995). Several side oxidation products result in the presence of oxygen, and their formation depends on the hydroperoxyl r a d i c a l  ( ·O O H )  b y  r e a c t i n g  w i t h  i n t e r m e d i a t e  r a d i c a l s  ( H a e m m e r l i  e t  a l . ,  1987). Recently, the revised mechanism has been discussed on the O
2-
dependent formation of side products during oxidation of VA by LiP (ten Have and Franssen, 2001). This mechanism shows that VA reacts ﬁ  rst with 
O
2 and that H 2O attacks thereafter. The inhibitory effect of Mn(II) on V A 
side product formation is explained in an alternative manner. Mn(II) reducing reactive intermediates to VA has also been proposed.
The extracellular glyoxal oxidase (GLOX; EC 1.2.3.5) is also involved in 
lignin degradation in P. chrysosporium , producing H
2O2 to catalyze peroxi-
dases (Kersten, 1990). Its action is to transfer electrons from low-molecular-weight aldehydes to O
2, thus forming H 2O2. The substrates for GLOX include 
glyoxal and many others. GLOX can be produced on aspen mechanical pulp by P. chrysosporium  (Datta et al., 1991) or in a chemically deﬁ  ned solid-state 
fermentation medium by Pleurotus ostreatus  ( K e r e m  a n d  H a d a r ,  1 9 9 6 ) .  
GLOX genes are cloned from P. chrysosporium . GLOX is expressed and 
secreted in Aspergillus nidulans  under maltose-inducible expression system 
at levels 50-fold greater than in P. chrysosporium  (Kersten et al., 1995).
Cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase (CBQ; EC 1.1.5.1) is a heme-ﬂ  avin 
enzyme that oxidizes cellobiose and some other carbohydrates and reduces a great number of quinones and radicals produced by LiP, MnP, and laccase on lignin model compounds (Ander, 1994). CBQ plays a role in lignin biodegra-dation in preventing oxidative polymerization of phenols. It also assists in the production of hydroxyl radical by a Fenton cycle (Hyde and Wood, 1997) and creates metal-complexing agents and promotes MnP-mediated Mn(III) pro-duction (Roy et al., 1994). In P. chrysosporium , CBQ is present under condi-tions of maximal [14C]DHP degradation (Costa-Ferreira et al., 1994). CBQ 
originates from the cdh gene in P. chrysosporium  (Raices et al., 2002).
C e l l o b i o s e  d e h y d r o g e n a s e  ( C D H ;  E C  1 . 1 . 9 9 . 1 8 )  i s  w i d e l y  p r o d u c e d  b y  
many white-rot Basidiomycetes, brown-rot Basidiomycetes in the family of Coniophoraceae, and some soft-rot fungi and molds, and these fungi have been listed by Henriksson et al. (2000). This is an extracellular ﬂ  avin- and 
heme-containing enzyme and can reduce O
2 and produce H 2O2. CDH of 
white-rot fungi have a molecular weight of 91 to 102 kDa with pIs of 3.8 to 4.2 and an optimum pH of 4.5 to 7.0. CDH and CBQ have many properties in common, including the ability to reduce quinones and oxidize cellobiose and related oligosaccharides. Various quinones and radicals are reduced by CBQ/CDH in white- and brown-rot fungi.
Interaction of CDH/CBQ with quinones and phenoxy radicals produced 
by LiP, MnP, and laccase during lignin and cellulose degradation has been depicted (Ander and Marzullo, 1997). CBQ/CDH is more closely related to cellulose than lignin degradation. CDH can be employed in the bleaching of pulp, similar to MnP and laccase. CDH degrades cellulose, xylan, and lignin in the presence of H
2O2 and chelated Fe ions. In addition, different functions 
of CDH are suggested. These include lignin biodegradation by reducing aro-matic radicals generated by ligninolytic enzymes (Temp and Eggert, 1999); support of MnP (Roy et al., 1994); reduction of compound II of ligninolytic peroxidases and completion of the catalytic cycle in the absence of peroxidase substrate (Ander et al., 1993); and degradation and modiﬁ  cation of cellulose, 
hemicellulose, and lignin by generating hydroxyl radicals in a Fenton-type reaction (Kremer and Wood, 1992; Henriksson et al., 1995; Mansﬁ  eld et al., 
1997). In the ﬁ  rst step, CDH modiﬁ  es a nonphenolic benzyl alcohol structure 
so that MnP can attack (Hilden et al., 2000). Hydroxyl radicals (·OH) gener-ated by cellobiose oxidase eliminate methanol from the aromatic ring, forming a phenolic hydroxy group that is susceptible to MnP attack. Genes encoding CDH are characterized from P. chrysosporium  ( L i  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 6 ) ,  Trametes 
versicolor  ( D u m o n c e a u x  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 8 ) ,  a n d  Pycnosporus cinnabarinus
(Moukha et al., 1999). Gene sequences in these fungi are very similar to each other. A cDNA encoding CDH from the wood-rotting fungus Grifola fron-
dosa  is cloned using RT-PCR, and rapid ampliﬁ  cation of cDNA ends (Yoshida 
et al., 2002). A CDH gene cloned from T. versicolor  is heterologously expressed 
in Pichia pastoris  under the control of AOX1  methanol inducible promoter 
(Stapleton et al., 2004). When more information is available, application of these enzymes will be extended to deligniﬁ  cation of pulps, pulp bleaching, 
and degradation of toxic chemicals.
Aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO; EC 1.1.3.7) is an extracellular FAD-
dependent enzyme and a source of H
2O2 r e q u i r e d  b y  p e r o x i d a s e s .  T h i s  
enzyme is found in P. chrysosporium  (Asada, 1995b) and in liquid cultures 
of other white-rot fungi [e.g., Pleurotus sajor-caju  (Bourbonnais and Paice, 
1988), P. eryngii  (Guillen et al., 1990), P. ostreatus  (P almi e ri  e t  al. ,  1 993),  
and Bjerkandera adusta  (Muheim et al., 1990)]. AAO from P. eryngii  is a FUNGAL LIGNIN-DEGRADING ENZYMES 377378 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 72 kDa. AAO from B. adusta  has two 
isoforms with molecular weights of 78 kDa and pIs of 4.25 and 4.35. The gene aao from P. eryngii  has been cloned, sequenced, and characterized (Varela 
et al., 1999). AAO from Pleurotus pulmonarius  has a molecular weight of 
70 kDa with a pI of 3.95, and the cDNA has been cloned and sequenced (Varela et al., 2000).
Aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (AAD; EC 1.1.1.91) is an intracellular NADP-
dependent enzyme found in P. eryngii  (Guillen and Evans, 1994). This 
enzyme supplies suitable amounts of aryl alcohol as a source of H
2O2. AAD 
appears to be important for the stability of LiP.
9.4.5 Reactive Oxygen Species
It is generally recognized that lignocellulolytic enzymes are too large to pen-
etrate the ligniﬁ  ed cell walls of wood, and fungi employ low-molecular-weight 
agents to initiate decay. These agents are small and diffusible enough to pen-etrate and may function in the depolymerization of wood cell walls. This hypothesis dates from the middle of the twentieth century, and these agents are known as reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Most of the work is known on hydroxyl radicals (·OH), but other ROSs, such as peroxyl radicals (ROO·) and hydroperoxyl radicals (·OOH), may be involved in fungal attack. Other biological ROS agents include singlet oxygen, hypochlorous acid, and per-oxynitrite. ROS appears to be implicated in three major types of wood decay by fungi.
The hydroxyl radical (·OH) has received more attention, as this is strongest 
oxidant in aqueous systems. A pathway is well established for its production via the Fenton reaction (H
2O2+ Fe2++ H+→ H 2O+ Fe3++ ·OH). The ·OH 
radicals are known to attack on polysaccharides and lignin. Oxidation of lignin with ·OH results in diverse reactions, some of which can degrade the polymer. These reactions include demethoxylation, hydroxylation, β-O-4 
ether cleavage, and C
α oxidation. However, the use of ·OH to oxidize lignin 
by any wood decay fungus is still unclear. The peroxyl (ROO·) and hydroper-oxyl (·OOH) are secondary radicals of wood polymers formed via reactions of ·OH and by some fungal enzymes. MnPs of white-rot fungi produce ROO· due to peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (Moen and Hammel, 1994). C. 
subvermispora  produces extracellular lipids that can be a source of peroxyl 
radicals (Enoki et al., 1999). However, more research is required for the role of MnP mechanism in wood decay. These radicals are less reactive and weaker oxidants than ·OH and may attack lignocellulose. They can abstract benzylic hydrogens at C
α of a lignin side chain and hydrogens from polysaccharides, 
stabilizing the carbon-center radical due to an adjacent hydroxy or ether oxygen. Peroxyl radicals can also abstract electrons from aromatic ethers those found in lignin similar to those reaction-catalyzed by LiP. These are more selectiv e o xidants than ·OH, due to nonabstraction of hy drogen from inactivated carbons.It is difﬁ  cult to identify ·OH or other ROSs in biological samples. One 
m e t h o d  u s e d  t o  d e t e c t  f r e e  r a d i c a l s  i n  c u l t u r e s  i s  e l e c t r o n  s p i n  r e s o n a n c e  spectroscopy (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). Another approach is the use of a molecular probe in the cultures that undergoes reactions with an ROS, with the accumulation of products. However, these probes are not speciﬁ  c and 
many ·OH detectors are oxidized by species other than ·OH, and sometimes to the same products as produced by ·OH. A sensitive and speciﬁ  c ﬂ uores-
cence method has been developed based on the hydroxylation of coumarin-3-carboxylic acid, which produces a ﬂ  uorescent and stable product, 
7-hydroxy-coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (7-OHCCA) (Tornberg and Olsson, 2002). Wood discs colonized by fungi are placed on water agar containing coumarin-3-carboxylic acid, forming 7-OHCCA with the measurement of ﬂ uorescence. Eight of 10 species of fungi produce ·OH above the detection 
limit. A brown-rot fungus produces the highest level: 8 to 25 times the detec-tion limit. T esting of this method in soil reveals 40% recovery of 7-OHCCA with K
2HPO 4 buffer. Wood decay Basidiomycetes also hydroxylate phthalic 
hydrazide to form a chemiluminescent product (Backa et al., 1992, 1993). Brown- and white-rot fungi show evidence of ·OH production by oxidizing dimethyl sulfoxide to methanesulﬁ  nic acid (Hirano et al., 1997; Tanaka et al., 
1999). This does not indicate whether the radicals are intracellular or extra-cellular. Monitoring degradation of recalcitrant polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used as a general probe for extracellular ROS by growing fungi on wood. PEG can detect the extracellular and nonspeciﬁ  c oxidants produced 
by fungi grown on natural substrates (Hammel et al., 2002). All of the Basid-iomycetes degrade PEG when they can grow on wood. A new assay to esti-mate ROS production based on the oxidation of a polymeric trap, [
14C]phenethyl 
polyacrylate, is used in cultures of Gloeophyllum trabeum  and Postia pla-
centa  (Cohen et al., 2002). Both fungi oxidize aromatic rings on the trap to 
form signiﬁ  cant amounts of 2,5-dimethoxyhydroxyquinone and 2,5-dime-
thoxy-1,4-benzoquinone and more polar products. 2,5-Dimethoxyhydroqui-none is known to be responsible for the Fenton chemistry in vitro. ROS levels are produced in signiﬁ  cant amounts in cellulose colonized by both fungi.
During fungal decay, greater ·OH production can occur at a distance from 
the fungal hyphae and within the ligniﬁ  ed secondary cell wall rather than on 
its surface (Hammel et al., 2002). Low-molecular-weight fungal reductants stable enough to diffuse into wood cell walls are used in situ for the genera-tion of ·OH. The purpose of small fungal metabolites is to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) or to reduce O
2 to H 2O2. Two well-established pathways for ·OH pro-
duction involve the extracellular reduction of Fe(III) and O 2 by cellobiose 
dehydrogenase or secreted hydroquinones. Many brown- and white-rot fungi produce oxalic acid, a strong chelator of Fe(III) and Fe(II). If the fungus-colonized wood contains mainly oxalate, redox properties of Fe–oxalate com-plexes will play a signiﬁ  cant role in the Fenton chemistry. A complete Fenton 
system is delayed until the diffusion of Fe(III) to some distance from the fungal hyphae (Hyde and Wood, 1997; Park et al., 1997). Here the Fenton FUNGAL LIGNIN-DEGRADING ENZYMES 379380 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
reagent is produced within secondary wood cell walls, and this mechanism 
will protect the fungus from the oxidative damage if ·OH produces outside the hyphae. This model has certain criticisms in that it assumes the formation of H
2O2 only via Fe(II) autooxidation and requires a pH below 2.5 near the 
hyphae, even at early stages of decay.
Quinone redox cycling is considered a source of ·OH. In this mechanism, 
the fungus reduces an extracellular quinone to hydroquinone that reacts with Fe(III) to form Fe(II) and a semiquinone radical. The semiquinone reduces O
2 to produce ·OOH and the original quinone. As ·OOH is a source of H 2O2,
this cycle will produce a complete Fenton system (Kerem et al., 1999). A wide variety of wood decay fungi produce extracellular Fe(III)-binding glycopep-tides that may play a role in the Fenton chemistry (Tanaka et al., 1999, 2000). The brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum  employs a quinone redox cycle 
to produce an extracellular Fenton reagent (Jensen et al., 2002). Ceriporiopsis 
subvermispora  produces 1-nonadecene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, an alkylitaconic 
acid (ceriporic acid B) that inhibits the formation of ·OH by the Fenton reac-tion due to direct interaction with Fe ions (Watanabe et al., 2002).
Petriellidium fusoideum  produces a protein-free low-molecular-weight 
substance of about 1.6 kDa containing 0.1% Fe(II) (Gonzales et al., 2002). Fungal laccase in cooperation with this substance generating the hydroxyl radicals participates in the mineralization of synthetic lignin. A hypothetical mechanism is proposed for the generation of ·OH radical in the system in order to describe its participation in the mineralization. Ligninolytic activity of white-rot fungi appears to be related to low-molecular-mass compounds of >5  k D a ,  i n  a d d i t i o n  t o  p e r o x i d a s e s  a n d  l a c c a s e s  ( M o r e i r a  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 7 ) .  
A nonphenolic β-O-4 lignin model dimer has been oxidized to products by 
three different peroxy radical–generating systems (Kapich et al., 1999b): (1) MnP/Mn(II)/linoleic acid, (2) arachidonic acid in which peroxidation initiates by a small amount of H
2O2/Fe(II), and (3) thermolysis in air by 
either 4,4 ′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) or 2,2 ′-azobis(2-methylpropionami-
dine) dihydrochloride. Products exhibited quantitative differences due to the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents on the peroxy radicals derived from azo precursors. Pathways for the oxidation by peroxyl radicals were proposed.
9.4.6 Miscellaneous Enzymes
Oxalate is produced by both white- and brown-rot fungi and acts as an organic 
acid chelator. It is secreted at the same time as MnP during liquid cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium . LiP and MnP can decompose oxalate in the 
presence of VA or Mn(II), respectively. The mechanism involves an electron-transfer reaction between the enzymatically formed V A
+• and oxalate, decar-
boxylating oxalate and reducing V A+• back to V A. Oxalate and malonate are 
secreted in signiﬁ  cant amounts capable of binding Mn(III), making it unavail-
able to MnP and thus decreasing the rate of Mn(II) oxidation. Strong chela-tors inhibit the formation of Mn(III)–malonate complex. Stimulation of MnP 
by chelators is necessary to dissociate Mn(III) from the enzyme because MnP reacts only with Mn(II). Oxalate coexistence with lignin-degrading enzyme systems indicates inhibition in lignin degradation. A small amount of oxalate decreases lignin content signiﬁ  cantly in biobleaching experiments. Two new 
types of extracellular peroxidase, Mn-inhibited peroxidase from Bjerkandera
sp. strain BOS55 (de Jong et al., 1992) and heme-containing from Junghuhnia
separabilima  (Vares et al., 1992) have been reported, but their role in lignin 
degradation is still unknown.
9.5 MECHANISMS OF FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION 
AND METABOLIC PRODUCTS
Most of the knowledge related to lignin degradation comes from the lignino-
lytic system and ultrastructure of selective white-rot fungi. Knowledge of the elucidation of mechanisms of degradation of lignin is still far from complete. However, mechanisms of fungal degradation of lignin have been discussed by several researchers and recently by ten Have and Teunissen (2001). The initial steps of lignin degradation are extracellular. The ﬁ  nal steps of min-
eralization are the release of CO
2 that occurs in the fungal h yphae. Lignin 
is broken into fragments by cellular reactions and diffusing into hyphae. Lignin contains monomers joined by C—C, a bond that is not easily hydro-lyzed. Lignin biodegradation is predominantly oxidative in nature; however, reductive reactions also occur. Polymerization of free phenolic groups may occur due to oxidation. Low-molecular-weight fragments are also released. Ligninolytic fungi have the ability to remove low-molecular-weight pieces from the mixture by glycolation or methylation. Lignin demethoxylation occurs using enzyme extracts from Gloeophyllum trabeum  (Lopretti et al., 
1998). Lignin demethylation by two brown-rot fungi, Postia placenta  and G. 
trabeum , plays a role in polysaccharide decomposition, possibly by assisting 
in F e n ton r eacti ons (Fille y e t al., 2002). Kir k and F arr e ll ( 1 987) called the process activated by an enzyme to initiate a thermodynamically favored oxidative fragmentation without control of the reaction pathway enzymatic 
combustion .
Lignin biodegradation leads to the formation of water-soluble intermedi-
ates in submerged or solid-state fermentation conditions. Reid (1991) con-ﬁ rmed oligomeric and water-soluble intermediates and products of synthetic 
lignin (DHP) degradation by Phlebia tremellosa . Lignin degradation does not 
follow an orderly removal of the peripheral subunits, but oxidation of aro-matic rings and side chains also takes place. Propyl side chains of β-1 and β-
O-4 compounds and aromatic ring openings are cleaved to elucidate the degradation pathways of lignin (Higuchi, 1985, 1993). P. chrysosporium  and 
T. versicolor  cleave alkyl side chains of β-O-4 linked monomethoxyphenyl-
propane structures to produce dihydroxybenzene products (Vane, 2003).FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND METABOLIC PRODUCTS 381382 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  cleaves β-O-4 lignin structures, releasing 
benzylic fragments by one-electron oxidation mechanism mediated by MnP–lipid peroxidation (Srebotnik et al., 1997). C. subvermispora  rapidly oxidizes 
β-5 phenolic dimer (Daina et al., 2002). However, the nonphenolic dimer is 
not utilized at all even after 21 days under nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-suf-ﬁ cient conditions. A crude MnP is responsible for the degradation of β-5 
phenolic compound in vitro. Several oxidation products are detected, but vanillic acid is the predominant degradation product, due to fungal and enzy-matic degradation. Crude MnP in the presence of Tween 80 fully oxidizes the methylated β-5 compound. C. subvermispora  has the ability to decompose 
lignin without penetration of enzymes into wood cell walls. This fungus pro-duces free 9,12-octadecadienoic, 9-octadecenoic, 11-octadecenoic, hexadeca-noic, and octadecanoic acids, predominantly at the incipient stage of cultivation on wood meal cultures (Enoki et al., 1999). During prolonged cultivation of 2 weeks, the amount of intact fatty acids decreases with concomitant produc-tion of organic hydroperoxide and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Immunoelectroscopy revealed the occurrence of ligninolysis at a site far from enzymes. It appears that ligninolysis is catalyzed by free radicals generated at the site of lignin degradation. Nonphenolic lignin is decomposed by a lipid hydroperoxide model in the presence of copper and a fungal metab-olite, pyridine (W atanabe et al., 1998). This suggests the production of free radicals for lignin degradation far from enzymes by a combination of metal complexes and lipid hydroperoxides.
White-rot fungi have the ability to degrade lignin in the soil in the presence 
of cosubstrate, but soil represses the mineralization. These fungi can also degrade lignin linked to humus. Several white-rot fungi degrade synthetic 
14C-(ring)-labeled DHP in soil (Tuomela et al., 2002). Phanerochaete sordida, 
Trametes versicolor , and Phlebia radiata  mineralize 4%, 7%, and 23% of 
[14C]DHP by inocula in soil, and other fungi mineralize 13 to 17%. Fungi 
decompose most of [14C]DHP from the dioxane fraction, and some of humic 
bound [14C]DHP to 14CO 2 and water-soluble products. The optimum wheat 
straw/soil ratio is 1 : 5 for these fungi. Trametes hirsuta  mineralizes 30% of 
[14C]DHP in a straw medium without soil. Most [14C]DHP remains bound to 
humic substances, especially to humic and fulvic acids, and the binding increases with a decrease in the amount of straw . More information on the mechanisms of lignin degradation was given in the foregoing paragraphs on lignin-degrading enzymes.
9.6 FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION OF PULP AND PAPER 
MILL EFFLUENTS
The pulp and paper industry is quite old. The color of the wastewaters is 
due mainly to lignin and lignin derivatives that are discharged from the pulping, bleaching, and chemical recovery operations. Lignin is converted in the form of thiolignin and alkali lignin during the Kraft process and 
in the form of lignosulfonate during the Sulﬁ  te process. Lignin and its 
derivatives are difﬁ  cult to degrade, due to the presence of diphenyl linkages 
and other bonds. Color is also attributed to double bonds associated with the aromatic ring, quinone methides, and quinone groups. This all implies the need for color removal. Two principal types of chlorine bleach plant wastewaters are produced: the ﬁ  rst chlorination (C
1) and the ﬁ  rst 
alkaline extraction stage (E 1) efﬂ  uents. The major components of C 1-stage 
efﬂ uent are chlorinated phenols; resins and fatty acids; chlorinated hydro-
carbons; hypochlorite, chloride, and their degradation products; and those of E
1 are chlorinated and oxidized kraft, and hemicelluloses and their deg-
radation products. The C 1-stage efﬂ  uents are of low molecular weight, high 
BOD, low color, toxic, and mutagenic; the E 1-stage efﬂ  uents are highly 
colored and contribute 80% of the color, 30% of the BOD, and 60% of the COD of the total mill discharge, although the volume is comparatively low. Efﬂ uents from subsequent stages in the bleaching sequence are of relatively 
minor importance because of their low dissolved organics content and the absence of chlorinated organics. The various efﬂ  uents—ﬁ  rst akali extraction 
stage E
1, brown stockwasher stage (BSW), combined bleach of all stages, 
and combined efﬂ  uent of efﬂ  uent treatment plant (ETP) from the pulp and 
paper mill—have been characterized (Mehna et al., 1995). The total pollu-tion load from a bleaching kraft mill is almost equivalent to that of a news-print factory employing kraft and mechanical pulping. Tissue and speciality paper mills contribute a high pollution load without chemical recovery. Paper board manufacturing discharges a low volume (68 to 90 l/kg of product) of efﬂ uent containing high BOD (72 to 82 kg/ton of product) and suspended 
solids (224 to 290 kg/ton) compared to paper mills (Bajpai and Bajpai, 1994).
Several physical and chemical methods are employed for the removal of 
color and chloroorganic materials. These include polymeric adsorption, lime coagulation, membrane processes, and rapid land inﬁ  ltration. Limitations and 
the expensive nature of these methods lead to a search for alternative methods of treatment. This includes biological decolorization by fungi that can degrade lignin-related phenolic compounds. Fungi, especially white-rot fungi, have been shown to metabolize lignin completely, resulting in rapid decolorization of the efﬂ  uents. Of 110 pure cultures screened, 10 strains decolorize 75 to 
85% of the extraction-stage efﬂ  uent within 24 to 48 hours (Nagarathnamma 
et al., 1999). Lignin molecules are polymerized and depolymerized upon treatment of black liquor by Trametes elegans  (Lara et al., 2003). These 
effects occur due to ligninolytic activity even in the absence of nutrients. Of eight fungal isolates, the decolorization potency of Paecilomyces sp. (F
3) is 
67% on the ﬁ  rst day, followed by Phoma  sp. (F 5) and Paecilomyces variotii
(F7) for the kraft bleach pulp efﬂ  uent (Thakur, 2004). Table 9.3 lists the 
various types of ﬁ  lamentous and white-rot fungi used in the decolorization 
of pulp and paper mill efﬂ  uents.FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION OF PULP AND PAPER MILL EFFLUENTS 383384 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
9.7 FUNGAL BIOREACTORS FOR DECOLORIZATION OF PULP 
AND PAPER MILL EFFLUENTS
Fungal bioreactors for the decolorization of pulp and paper mill efﬂ  uents have 
been known since the 1980s and are not yet fully developed. Most of the information comes from the application of white-rot ﬁ  ngi in decolorization 
and degradation of these efﬂ  uents. However, more knowledge is required, 
along with the reﬁ  ning of these processes. Fungal bioreactors for the decol-
orization of these efﬂ  uents are organized in Table 9.4 and are classiﬁ  ed into 
the categories described below.

decolorization of such efﬂ  uents. Pellets of Coriolus versicolor  can decolorize 
ultraﬁ  ltered kraft liquor with a negligible loss of activity and follow ﬁ  rst-order 
kinetics for the decolorization of bleached kraft efﬂ  uents (Royer et al., 1991). 
Fungal pellets are useful in airlift bioreactors to minimize operating costs.
Of three lignin-degrading marine fungi, an unidentiﬁ  ed basidiomycete 
fungus, no. 312, decolorizes 74% of bleach plant efﬂ  uent at pH 8.2 and 98% 
at pH 4.5 (Raghukumar et al., 1996). The marine fungi secrete a laccase that is responsible for the effective decolorization of the efﬂ  uent. Removal of COD 
coincides with lignin degradation using the bioﬁ  lms of ﬁ  ve white-rot fungi 
(Wu et al., 2005). Prouty (1990) obtained a maximum decolorization rate of 1300 PCU per day in an aerated reactor using P. chrysosporium . The color 
was reduced to 88% in 48 hours in a laboratory fermentor using T. versicolor
strain T (Bergbauer et al., 1991 ). Of three laboratory-scale continuous-ﬂ  ow 
decolorization bioreactors using Trichoderma  sp., treatment III was the most 
attractive, as it decolorized 57% at pH 4.0 after 3 days and maintained over a period of 18 days (Prasad and Joyce, 1991).
9.7.2 Upﬂ  ow Column Bioreactors
A bench-scale upﬂ  ow column bioreactor is used for the treatment of paper 
and pulp efﬂ  uent (Taseli and Gokcay, 1999; Taseli et al., 2004). The column

1.5 years with 70% AOX removal in 7 to 8 hours contact with no aeration 
and a minimum amount of carbon supplement. The highest color removal (60%) and AOX removal (76%) occurred at 0.2 g/l acetate feed concentration.
9.7.3 Immobilized Bioreactors
A considerable amount of work has been done on the use of fungal immobi-
lization to remove efﬂ  uents. Earlier immobilized systems, rotating biological 
contactors (RBCs) and trickling ﬁ  lters, employed passive immobilization 
methods involving adhesion of cells to a solid support. P. chrysosporium
mycelia on discs of the RBC are used continuously for over 35 days without loss of decolorization activity in the E
1 efﬂ uent (Eaton et al., 1982). The ﬁ  xed 
ﬁ lm of P. chrysosporium  FPL/NCSE MyCor is applied for color removal 
(Campbell et al., 1982). The MyCor process is also successful for the treat-ment of chlorinated low-molecular-weight phenols of the E
1 efﬂ uent (Huynh 
et al., 1985). A decolorization process for an RBC using whole cells of P.
chrysosporium  r e s u l t e d  i n  a  p a t e n t  ( C h a n g  e t  a l . ,  1 9 8 7 ) .  A  t r i c k l i n g  ﬁ  lter 
system employs polyurethane for immobilization in the treatment of bleach plant efﬂ  uents in the MyCOPOR process (Messner et al., 1990). Rapid deg-
radation of bleach plant efﬂ  uent occurs during the ﬁ  rst 3 to 6 hours in a 
trickling ﬁ  lter system, in which immobilized  P. chrysosporium  removes 50% 
of color and AOX (Bajpai and Bajpai, 1997). This results in a reduction of 80% toxicity against Daphnia magna .
Active immobilization techniques include cell entrapment, which can 
withstand high mechanical resistance and stability against pH and media variations. A cell-free system of Trametes versicolor  r es ul ted in 56 t o 77 % 
continuous decolorization and 41 to 69% AOX reduction in a retention time of 24 hours of pulp and paper wastes (Pallerla and Chambers, 1995a). However, a calcium–alginate polymer bead system with T. versicolor  resulted 
in 76 to 83% decolorization and 43 to 59% AOX reduction. A cell-free system of T. versicolor  decolorized 70% per day, and the decolorization 
efﬁ ciency declined rapidly on the eighth day of the kraft bleach efﬂ  uents 
(Pallerla and Chambers, 1995b). However, continuous immobilized bioreac-tor supports an average of 69% decolorization and 53% AOX reduction within a residence time of 24 hours. About 69% color and 58% AOX are reduced in the caustic-stage efﬂ  uent in an immobilized bioreactor using 
calcium–alginate–entrapped  T. versicolor  (Pallerla and Chambers, 1997). 
Color (61 to 72%) and AOX (54 to 49%) reductions are achieved using a combined efﬂ  uent (caustic and acidic stages) as the bioreactor feed. The E
1
efﬂ uent decolorizes in a continuous bioreactor containing white-rot fungus 
immobilized on polyurethane foam with removal of 70% color, 64% total phenols, and 7% organic chlorine within 5.8 hours of retention time (Cammarota and SantAnna, 1992). An immobilized T. versicolor  mycelium 
darkens progressively due to the accumulation of lignin molecules (Martin and Manzanares, 1994). Of 80% decolorization, 50% is attributed to adsorp-
tion and 30% to fungal degradation.
Jute rope–immobilized P. chrysosporium  exhibited a better performance 
than cotton and straw in color removal and COD reduction of an anaerobi-cally digested black liquor (Marwaha et al., 1998). The maximum reduction in color (86%) and COD (54%) was noted up to 3 days and maintained up to the eighth day of the operation and declined thereafter. The reduction in decolorization and COD was due to the deposition of solids on a jute-adsorbed fungal culture. Rhizopus oryzae  removed 92 to 95% of 
the color, 50% of the COD, and 72% of the AOX of the alkaline extraction–stage E
1 efﬂ u e n t  a t  2 5  t o  4 5 º C ,  p H  3  t o  5 ,  w i t h i n  2 4  h o u r s  
(Nagarathnamma and Bajpai, 1999). Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  CZ-3 
removed 90% of the color, 45% of the COD, 62% of the lignin, and 32% of the AOX in 48 hours at 30 to 35ºC and pH 4.0 to 4.5 (Nagarathnamma et al., 1999). Immobilized Rhizopus oryzae  and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora
mycelia in the polyurethane foam have also been employed repeatly to treat batches of efﬂ  uent. During the ﬁ  rst batch cycle, the decolorization and COD 
reduction were 95% and 55% by Rhizopus oryzae  and 95% and 44% by 
Ceriporiopsis subvermispora , respectively. Decolorization of bleach plant 
efﬂ uent in a RBC by both Rhizopus pusillus  and Coriolus versicolor  was 
directly proportional to the initial color intensities (Driessel and Christov, 2001). The biomass levels in the RBC reactor were 44 g for C. versicolor  and 
68.5 g for R. pusillus .R. pusillus  removed 71% color and COD each and 
55% AOX, while C. versicolor  reduced 53% of the color, 59% of the COD, 
and 40% of the AOX within 72 hours. Both fungal treatments rendered the efﬂ uent nontoxic. Overall, R. pusillus  was more effective in efﬂ  uent treat-
ment than C. versicolor . MnP and laccase are detected only in C. versicolor .
Both fungi exhibit differences in the mechanism of color removal, such as adsorption and biodegradation for C. versicolor  and adsorption for R. 
pusillus .
9.7.4 Miscellaneous Bioreactors
A biomass of Rhizomucor pusillus , a thermotolerant fungus, removed 43% 
and 48% of bleach plant efﬂ  uent after 2 and 8 hours, respectively (Christov 
et al., 1999). This fungus can grow and tolerate up to 55ºC and exhibits 85% more decolorizing ability at 55ºC than at 35ºC. This will eliminate the need to cool the efﬂ  uent for treatment. More than 60% decolorization of E
1-stage 
efﬂ uent occurred using P. chrysosporium  pellets after 24 hours, which is 
attributed to rapid adsorption (Jaspers and Penninckx, 1996).
Efﬂ uent chromophores of E 1 efﬂ uent are destroyed by both ozone and 
Coriolus versicolor  treatment, but higher degradation in the form of COD 
removal is expressed by fungal treatment (Roy-Arcand and Archibald, 1991). Monoaromatic chlorophenolics and toxicity are removed partially by ozone and completely by C. versicolor . Both treatments show equal degradation of FUNGAL BIOREACTORS FOR DECOLORIZATION OF PULP 389390 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
all sizes of molecules based on molecular-weight distributions. Partial 
color removal by ozone treatment followed by fungal treatment provides more effective color removal than fungal pretreatment. Nearly 46 to 53% color is removed by ozone treatment after 24 hours compared to 29% by fungal treatment alone. Biological treatment and post-ozonation are used in mature Eucalyptus kraft bleachery efﬂ  uents (Boyden et al., 1994). A fungal 
isolate, Aspergillus . p2, reduces about 54% of the color in the presence of 
glucose. Ozonation as a tertiary treatment reduces 60% of the AOX, and the color decrease follows ﬁ  rst-order kinetics. Fungal decolorization can be 
combined with activated sludge of the cotton bleaching efﬂ  uent (Zhang 
et al., 1999). First, efﬂ  uent was decolorized with the mycelial pellets of 
fungus 7, reducing color by 80%. Second, the decolorized efﬂ  uent was treated 
w i t h  a c t i v a t e d  s l u d g e  t o  r e m o v e  t h e  r e s i d u a l  C O D .  T h i s  s h o w s  t h a t  p r i o r  decolorization of the efﬂ  uent by fungus 7 was easily mineralized by the 
activated sludge.
In addition to a good fungal selection for efﬂ  uent treatment, pretreatment 
is necessary to shorten the retention time for the efﬂ  uent in a bioreactor. 
Efﬁ cient decolorization was attained by preirradiation of the efﬂ  uent (15 
min u t e s )  a t  p H  6.5 ,  f o ll o w e d  b y  Chrysonilia sitophila  culture ﬁ  ltrate treat-
ment (Duran et al., 1991 ). This decolorization was enhanced by an enzyme cofactor such as hydrogen peroxide. A combination of photochemical and biological methods reduced the COD (Duran, 1992). A combination of photo-chemical and fungal treatment was also used for the treatment of Eucalyptus
kraft E
1 efﬂ uents (Duran et al., 1994). Lentinus (Lentinula )edodes  UEC-
2019 removed 73% color of the efﬂ  uent in 5 days without an additional 
carbon source. The efﬂ  uent was preirradiated for 10 minutes in the presence 
of photocatalyst, ZnO, and followed by L. edodus  treatment, and this resulted 
in effective decolorization after 48 hours. Irradiated efﬂ  uent showed dimin-
ished levels of laccase, peroxidase, and β-glucosidase to the half-level. 
However, LiP and MnP levels were enhanced fourfold. Biomass losses to mineralization were 70% in the biobleaching system and 8% in the preirra-diated biobleaching system. Both systems reduced the COD: to 60% and 70%, respectively. The quinone- and carbonyl-type colors were removed more efﬁ  ciently during fungal decolorization. The combined photo-fungal 
decolorization treatment appears to be an efﬁ  cient decontamination process 
with no color speciﬁ  city and with a great potential in the industrial efﬂ  uent 
treatment.
In a two-step sequential bioreactor, Paecilomyces sp. (F
3) reduced 68% of 
the color of kraft bleached pulp and paper mill efﬂ  uent within 1 day (Thakur, 
2004). However, 82% of the color was reduced on the third day, when fungal-treated efﬂ  uent was subsequently treated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
Anaerobically treated efﬂ  uent was applied aerobically in a bioreactor in the 
presence of Paecilomyces sp. (Singh and Thakur, 2005). Paecilomyces sp. 
reduced lignin 86%, color 95%, AOX 67%, phenol 63%, and COD 88% after 3 days.9.8 FACTORS AFFECTING DECOLORIZATION OF PULP AND 
PAPER MILL EFFLUENTS
Several factors, including carbon, nitrogen, pH, temperature, dilution of the 
efﬂ uent, inoculum dose, and static versus agitated culture conditions, are 
known to inﬂ  uence the rate of decolorization of pulp and paper will efﬂ  uents. 
Various factors inﬂ  uencing the decolorization of such efﬂ  uents are noted in 
Table 9.5.
9.8.1 Carbon Cosubstrate
Glucose is one of the most effective substrates for the decolorization of bleach 
plant efﬂ  uents by Rhizopus oryzae  (Nagarathnamma and Bajpai, 1999), 
Trichoderma  sp. (Prasad and Joyce, 1991), and fungus 7 (Zhang et al., 1999). 
T. versicolor  removes color efﬁ  ciently in the presence of sugar reﬁ  nery or 
b r e w e r y  w a s t e s  ( A r c h i b a l d  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 0 ).  S chizophyllum commune  reduces 
nearly 80% of the color in 5 days by the addition of 1% bagasse pith (Ramas-wamy, 1987). T. versicolor  reduced the color about 90% within 3 days with 
glucose as cosubstrate, accompanied by a 45% reduction in AOX (Bergbauer et al., 1991). Over 50% of total aromatic compounds are degraded. The pres-ence of cosubstrate is necessary for all these activities by the fungus. Success-ful treatment of E
1 efﬂ uent by Lentinus (Lentinula )edodes  UEC-2019 
resulted in 73% decolorization, reductions of 60% COD, 30% BOD, and 30% phenolics, and only 13% decolorization due to mycelia adsorption without the addition of a carbon or nitrogen source (Esposito et al., 1991). Growth of Candida utilis  in spent sulﬁ  te liquor resulted in a 57% reduction in COD 
(Streit et al., 1987).
9.8.2 Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Sulfur, and Chloride Concentrations
Increased nitrogen levels inhibit the biodegradation of lignin and derivatives. 
Higher decolorization rates occur in media containing no NH
4Cl, and the 
addition of NH 4Cl is deleterious for the decolorization and sustained decol-
orization under nitrogen-limiting conditions by fungus 7 (Zhang et al., 1999). LiP was produced in media containing high levels of nitrogen. No MnP activ-ity in nitrogen-limited media with added NH
4+ and no laccase activity occurred 
in any culture of fungus 7. Nitrogen-limiting conditions or an excess nitrogen supply has no signiﬁ  can t e ff ect o n th e ra te o f deco l o riza ti o n (B a j pai e t al., 
1993; Nagarathnamma et al., 1999; Nagarathnamma and Bajpai, 1999). No signiﬁ  cant color was removed by the addition of magnesium sulfate by R. 
oryzae  (Nagarathnamma and Bajpai, 1999). The maximum color was reduced 
with 1 g/l of KH
2PO 4 as well as 1.5 g/l of calcium chloride. The maximum 
color, BOD, and COD reduction using optimum concentrations of sucrose and NH
4Cl were 82%, 63.3% and 75%, respectively, using Schizophyllum
commune  (Belsare and Prasad, 1988). The degradation was completed within FACTORS AFFECTING DECOLORIZATION 391TABLE 9.5 Factors Affecting Fungal Decolorization of Pulp and Paper Mill Efﬂ  uents

9.8.3 Hydrogen Ion Concentration and Temperature
The optimum pH and temperature for decolorization are 5.0 and 27ºC 
for fungus 7 (Zhang et al., 1999). On the contrary, decolorization occurs a t  3 7  t o  3 9 º C  b y  t h e r m o t o l e r a n t  P. chrysosporium  ( M e s s n e r  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 0 ;  
F e i j o o  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 5 ) .  P r a c t i c a l l y ,  d e c o l o r i z a t i o n  o f  l i g n i n  i s  n o n e x i s t e n t  a t  40ºC and weak at temperatures below 32ºC by C. versicolor  pellets (Royer 
et al., 1985). R. pusillus  can grow and retain 85% more decolorizing 
activities at 55ºC than at 30ºC (Driessel and Christov, 2001). C. subvermis-
pora removes nearly 88% of the color at an optimum pH of 4.0 to 4.5 
and temperature of 30 to 35ºC (Nagarathnamma et al., 1999). The highest removal of lignin (78%) and COD (78%) occurred at pH 9.0 for P. chryso-
sporium  and and 84% and 69%, respectively, for isolate S22 at pH 10.0 (Wu 
et al., 2005).
9.8.4 Dilution of Efﬂ  uent
Dilution of the efﬂ  uent has a strong effect on increased decolorization. The 
greatest percentage (81%) of color removal occurs at 20% (vol.) cotton bleaching efﬂ  uent (Zhang et al., 1999). The degradation rate (75%) increases 
to 30% (vol.) and then remains constant or declines slightly.
9.8.5 Inoculum Dose and Nature
Color removal of combined bleach plant efﬂ  uents is proportional to an inocu-
lum concentration that results in 60% color reduction at 15% inoculum levels after 6 days of treatment with C. versicolor  (Eaton et al., 1982). An inoculum 
dose of 0.5 g/l was optimal for decolorization using R. oryzae  (Nagarath-
namma and Bajpai, 1999). A cool storage time for mycelial pellets of fungus 7 also affects the decolorization activity (Zhang et al., 1999). About 68 to 74% of the color was removed in 4 days by mycelial pellets kept for 1, 3, and 4 months, which is similar to 73% color removal by fresh mycelia in 4 days. However, decolorization activity was lowerd to 36% in 6 days by 6-month-old mycelia. Good storage stability implies the use of mycelial pellets as com-mercial biocatalysts in color removal processes. The mycelium harvesting time also affects the decolorization (Nagarathnamma et al., 1999). The best decolorization takes place when the mycelium of C. subvermispora  CZ-3 is 
harvested after 144 hours of incubation. It also seems that LiP and laccase of Ganoderma lucidum  play a part in the decolorization of paper mill efﬂ  uent 
(Perumal et al., 2000).FACTORS AFFECTING DECOLORIZATION 395396 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
9.8.6 Static Versus Agitated Culture Conditions
Poor growth and limited efﬂ  uent color occur in static cultures (Martin and 
Manzanares, 1994). Agitation of efﬂ  uents at 180 rpm results in a signiﬁ  cant 
loss of color with an immobilized T. versicolor  biomass rather than pellets. 
Pelleted biomass under submerged cultural conditions contributes to deﬁ  cient 
oxygen in the mycelium, thus inﬂ  uencing lower fungal growth and color 
removal. This implies that the operating conditions can allow a better envi-ronment of oxygen diffusion into the medium to prove the proper utility of pellets in decolorization. Decolorization was elevated from 82% to 90%, and BOD and COD were reduced to 70% and 79%, respectively, using S. commune
after aeration for 5 minutes every 8 hours for 5 days (Belsare and Prasad, 1988).
9.9 EFFECT OF FUNGAL TREATMENT ON CHLOROPHENOLS 
AND CHLOROALDEHYDES IN EFFLUENTS
Fungal treatment is also known to remove different types of chlorinated 
phenols and aldehydes in efﬂ  uents. C. subvermispora  CZ-3 treatment shows 
good removal of chlorophenols and chloroaldehydes in E
1-stage efﬂ  uent 
(Nagarathnamma et al., 1999). 3-Chlorocatechol, 3,6-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol, 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol, tetrachlorocatechol, 3,4,5-trichlo-roguaiacol, and pentachlorophenol are completely removed after fungal treatment. The percentage removal of 3,6-dichloroguaiacol, 5-chloroguaiacol, 4,5,6-trichloroguaiacol, 6-chloroguaiacol, 2,6-chlorosyringaldehyde, trichlo-rosyringaldehyde, 4-chlorophenol, and 2-chlorophenol is 96, 94, 73, 67, 64.5, 45.9, 37.8, and 36.5, respectively. The effect of fungal treatment on the elimi-nation of chlorophenols and chloroaldehydes in E
1-stage efﬂ  uent by R. oryzae
has also been demonstrated (Nagarathnamma and Bajpai, 1999). The fungal treatment attains complete removal of 2-chlorophenol, 2,6-dichlorophenol, 5-chloroguaiacol, 4,5-dichloroguaiacol, 4,6-dichloroguaiacol, 3,4,5-trichlo-roguaiacol, 4,5,6-trichloroguaiacol, 4-chlorocatechol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 2,6-dichlorosyringaldehyde, and trichlorosyringaldehyde. The percentage removal of 4-chlorophenol, 4,5-dichloroguaiacol, 3,4,6-trichloroguaiacol, 2-chlorosyringaldehyde, and tetrachloroguaiacol is 94, 53, 95, 51, and 58, respectively.
Treatability of chlorinated model compounds such as trichloroacetic acid, 
2-chlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol in batch experiments by Penicillium 
sp. suggests better dechlorination of chlorinated aromatics than of aliphatics (Taseli and Gokcay, 1999). Better degradation occurs in ring compounds with numerous chlorine atoms than with fewer chlorine atoms. The molecular-weight distribution before and after fungal treatment demonstrated complete removal of small phenolics (MW <1000), suggesting toxicity reduction in the 
efﬂ uents. A signiﬁ  cant reduction in medium-range phenolics (MW: 1000 to 10 000) and an increase in the mezo range (MW: 10 000 to 30 000) were also 
noted.
The toxicity was assessed by the bioassay test using guppi/zebra ﬁ  sh 
(Nagarathnamma et al., 1999; Nagarathnamma and Bajpai, 1999). In both cases, the initial LC
50 (96 hours) of E 1-stage efﬂ  uent was in the range 50 to 
55% by volume. The efﬂ  uents were nontoxic after respective fungal treat-
ments. This implies the removal of highly toxic compounds such as tri- and tetrachlorophenolic compounds. Nearly 90% color removal and signiﬁ  cant 
toxicity reduction were obtained in CEH bleachery efﬂ  uents by the Coelo-
mycetous fungus Stagonospora gigaspora  (Bergbauer et al., 1992).
9.10 DECOLORIZATION OF EFFLUENTS BY 
FUNGAL ENZYMES
Fungal enzymes, especially peroxidases and laccases, have good potential in 
decolorization of bleach plant efﬂ  uents, which contain mostly phenolics and 
aldehydes. The enzyme activities have been identiﬁ  ed related to the efﬂ  uent 
(Nagarathnamma et al., 1999). Of three important ligninolytic enzymes, LiP was not detected in the culture ﬂ  uid or in the mycelium. The maximum 
laccase and MnP activities were detected on day 6 and 7, respectively, in the culture. The activities of both enzymes in the mycelium were quite low. None of the three ligninolytic enzymes was detected in the culture supernatant of R. oryzae  (Nagarathnamma and Bajpai, 1999). However, the maximum 
laccase and MnP activities were detected on day 6 and 7, respectively, in the biomass. MnP plays an important role in the decolorization of efﬂ  uents by 
white-rot fungi. LiP and MnP are detected in Phanerochaete ﬂ  avido-alba  and 
appear to be implicated in the decolorization of partially biodepurated paper mill efﬂ  uents, but LiP activity plays a more important role (Perez et al., 1997). 
P o o r  l a cc a s e  a c t i vi ty  b y  an  a s co m y ce t e ,  Paecilomyces variotii , signiﬁ  cantly 
decolorizes pulp mill efﬂ  uent (Calvo et al., 1996).
Fungal enzymes can be immobilized for the decolorization of bleach plant 
efﬂ uents (Table 9.6). Activated silica is employed to immobilize LiP type I, 
II, III, and lyophilized fungal culture from Chrysonilia sitophila  (Dezotti et 
al., 1995). Of these, LiP type III is the most efﬁ  cient, showing 20% chloro-
lignin mineralization, 65% COD reduction, and 12% decolorization of Euca-
lyptus  kraft efﬂ  uent. None of these immobilized types showed a loss of 
activities after being frozen for 4 months or after 5-day contact with the kraft efﬂ uent. MnP of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  appeared to be the major 
enzyme responsible for 85% decolorization of kraft bleach efﬂ  uent after 4 
days (Michel et al., 1991). Free LiP and lyophilized fungal culture from Chrysonilia sitophila  decolorized 13% and 6% of kraft efﬂ  uent, respectively, 
after 48 hours (Ferrer et al., 1991). Immobilization of LiP type III and lyophi-lized fungal culture on CNBr–Sepharose 4B decolorized 38% and 29% of kraft efﬂ  uent, respectively, after 48 hours. It seems that LiPs and lyophilized DECOLORIZATION OF EFFLUENTS BY FUNGAL ENZYMES 397TABLE 9.6 Fungal Enzymes for Decolorization of Bleach Plant Efﬂ  uents

398fungal culture have potential in treating kraft efﬂ  uents. The extent of decol-
orization by soluble and immobilized phenol oxidases and of C. versicolor
has been compared (Davis and Burns, 1990). Soluble laccase and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) removed color in different efﬂ  uents, but fast and irrevers-
ible enzyme inactivation occurred. Immobilization of these enzymes by entrapped-alginate beads resulted in several-fold decolorization of all efﬂ  u-
ents. Enzymes are released rapidly in solution, and thus beads could not be employed for continuous purposes. Copolymerization of laccase or HRP with l-tyrosine can lead to the formation of insoluble polymers with enzymatic 
activity. Entrapment of these copolymers in alginate beads enhanced the decolorization of pulp mill efﬂ  uent 28 (laccase)- and 132 (HRP)-fold com-
pared with soluble enzymes. Laccase reduced color 40% in 80 minutes.
Enzymatic decolorization of efﬂ  uents has not met with great success. Many 
aspects of the mechanisms and functions of fungal enzymes in the decoloriza-tion processes of efﬂ  uents are still unknown. However, decolorization by 
enzymes has some advantages over fungal treatment. Fungal treatment requires the addition of cosubstrate and adjustment of pH and in certain cases, dilution of the efﬂ  uent.
9.11 WETLANDS TREATMENT
Wastewater decolorization in constructed wetlands depends on the decompo-
sition activity of microorganisms, especially fungi. It is important to identify and characterize the microbial populations and the dominating colonies in the wetlands. The microbial populations are evaluated in two free-water-surface constructed wetland cells receiving secondary-treated pulp mill wastewater (Hatano et al., 1994). Fungal and actinomycetes populations exhibit small size compared to bacteria in soil or wastewater. About 70% and 50% of fungi show protease and amylase activities, respectively. Fungi exhibit xylanase activity in 40% of isolates. More than 90% of actinomycetes have amylase activity, and 60% and 25% of them have chitinase and xylanase activities, respectively. About 40% of bacteria show protease activity and a few of them have chitinase and xylanase activities. Such microbes can play an important role in reducing the BOD of wastewaters. Unfortunately, the role of constructed wetlands in paper mill efﬂ  uents by diverse microbial communi-
ties has not been given much consideration.
9.12 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
During the past decade, considerable work has been performed on the screen-
ing of fungi in lignin degradation and the treatment of pulp and paper mill efﬂ uents. The role of fungal enzymes in depolymerization of lignin has been 
investigated extensively. Fungal enzymes such as LiPs, MnPs, and laccases CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 399400 FUNGAL LIGNIN DEGRADATION AND DECOLORIZATION
have been established for breaking down lignin. Chemical mediators have 
also been discovered for the laccase-assisted deligniﬁ  cation of pulps. The 
mechanism of lignin solubilization by enzymes is not co mpletely known; 
however, enzymes at appropriate concentrations can shorten the time required for biopulping and biobleaching. Pathways of lignin biodegradation and its metabolic products have not been determined.
The use of fungi in bioreactors shows success for the decolorization of pulp 
and paper efﬂ  uents. By optimizing the requirements, including the coproduc-
tion of the relevant enzymes, H
2O2 and VA, a cost-effective and reliable 
conﬁ  gured bioreactor can be established, resulting in a higher rate of efﬂ  uent 
decolorization. Immobilized bioreactors with sufﬁ  cient mechanical and 
chemical stability, extending the activity and lifetime of the biocatalysts, have already shown promise in decolorization and dechlorination of efﬂ  uents. 
Clariﬁ  cation of the degradation mechanisms will facilitate the development 
of novel types of bioreactors. Efﬂ  uent decolorization by fungal enzymes is 
still a new area that requires more research.
Despite excellent work on enzymes and genetics of wood degradation by 
white-rot fungi (Kirk and Cullen, 1998), molecular genetics has not played a signiﬁ  cant role in improving the effectiveness of lignin-degrading fungi, 
leading to shorter reaction times and decolorization and degradation of efﬂ  u-
ents. Fungal genes have not been isolated speciﬁ  c to meeting these objectives. 
A 30 million base pair genome of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  strain RP78 
has been sequenced by a whole-genome shotgun method (Martinez et al., 2004). This opens new horizons for a variety of molecular biology studies related to lignin biodegradation. This will include the extended role of various ligninolytic enzymes for the intracellular catabolism of lignin-derived aro-matic compounds. Now, it appears that selective efﬂ  uent decolorizing fungi 
can be developed that will open a new era in the pulp and paper industry in a few decades. Protein engineering is also being considered to improve the catalytic properties of enzymes that will lead to a new generation of tailor-made ligninolytic enzymes.

FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND 
DEGRADATION OF DYES
10.1 INTRODUCTION
Large quantities of water and chemicals are used for the processing of textiles 
in the textile dye industries. These processes include desizing, scouring, bleaching, neutralizing, dyeing, printing, and ﬁ  nishing, leading to the genera-
tion of the dyed product and dye wastewater. Chemicals vary from inorganics to polymers to organic products. More than 100 000 synthetic dyes exist com-mercially, with over 7 × 10
5 tons produced annually worldwide. An estimated 
10 to 15% is directly lost in the wastewater, which carries a potential to cause environmental harm, including the formation of toxic amines under anaerobic conditions. Up to 50% of dyes are lost through hydrolysis in the reactive dye process, and the environmental fate is largely unknown. A problem of heavy metal ions also exists in wastewaters of metal-containing dyes.
Synthetic dyes are employed increasingly in the textile, paper, cosmetic, 
pharmaceutical, and food industries, due to high stability, wide variety of color, and good cost-effectiveness in synthesis compared to natural dyes. Dye color in industrial wastewaters is one of the most important environmental concerns in the textile industry. Water-soluble reactive dyes consist mainly of azo, anthraquinone, formazan, and phthalocyanine dyes. These are also used in printing industries, color photography, and as additives in petroleum prod-ucts. The color must be removed from wastewaters before discharge to land or any water body. Even small amounts of dyes (less than 1 ppm) in water inﬂ uence the aesthetic value in various water bodies. Removal of color is

als that are responsible for the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Engi-neers have already established methods for the removal of BOD, but dyes are more difﬁ  cult to remediate, due to the presence of complex aromatic

due to their possible toxicity and carcinogenicity. This is because many dyes are comprised of known carcinogens, such as benzidine and other aromatic compounds. The reduction of azo dyes in the intestinal environment, in anaerobic sediments, and decomposition to potential carcinogenic amines has already been established. Resistance of anthraquinone dyes due to fused aromatic compounds and greater color intensity of basic dyes and chromium-containing dyes, releasing chromium, contributes to a tendency to toxic behavior. Current knowledge of the long-term deleterious effects of dyes has not been completely assessed. Some disperse dyes also show a tendency to bioaccumulate in aquatic systems. Heavy metal ions accumulate in algae and wheat plants exposed by textile wastewaters (Srivastava and Prakash, 1991). The toxicity of azo dyes has been predicted by Brown and DeVito (1993). Certain dyes are also toxic to the single-cell green alga Selenastrum capri-
cornutum  and the fathead minnow Pimephales promelas  (Hao et al., 2000).
10.2 CLASSIFICATION, STRUCTURE, AND 
COLOR MEASUREMENTS
The complex structure of dye compounds is described in the Kirk–Othmer 
Encyclopedia  (ECT, 1977) and in Colour for Textiles  (Ingamells, 1993). The 
Color Index , prepared by the Society of Dyers and Colourists (1976), reported 
more than 8000 chemical products related to the dyeing process. The Color 
Index  (CI) number is used for dye classiﬁ  cation. After documentation of the 
chemical structure of a dye, a ﬁ  ve-digit number is assigned. The ﬁ  rst word 
pertains to the dye classiﬁ  cation, and the second word is the shade or hue of 
the dye. For example, Acid Violet 34 is classiﬁ  ed as CI 61 710.
Based on the structure of the chromophoric group, Zollinger (1991) clas-
siﬁ ed dyes into different categories, such as azo, anthraquinone, phthalocya-
nine, and triarylmethane (triphenylmethane) dyes. These are also called reactive dyes . Among the other classes of dyes, the reactive dyes are the only 
colorants that can bond covalently with fabrics. Twelve different chromato-phores of dyes are recognized. Dyes are also classiﬁ  ed into acid, basic, direct, 
disperse, mordant, reactive, sulfur, azoic, and vat types (Hao et al., 2000). Textile dyes are classiﬁ  ed into three categories: cationic, anionic, and non-
ionic (Mishra and Tripathy, 1993). Anionic dyes include direct, acid, and reactive dyes; cationic, basic dyes; and nonionic, disperse dyes. Based on the mode of dyes or molecular structure, dyes may be classiﬁ  ed as acid, 
direct, dispersant, and so on, which cannot be employed as a criterion for CLASSIFICATION, STRUCTURE, AND COLOR MEASUREMENTS 421422 FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND DEGRADATION OF DYES
environmental purposes. Azo dyes  contain one or more functional groups, 
such as nitro-, carboxyl-, and sulfonic acid. Metal-complex dyes are known as phthalocyanine dyes . These dyes are characterized by at least one metal in 
their composition. Anthraquinone dyes  contain more methyl groups. Triphe-
nylmethane dyes  are composed of three phenyl groups along with methyl 
groups. The molecular structures of azo, anthraquinone, phthalocyanine, tri-phenylmethane, and other dyes are well known in the literature.
Five methods have been established for the determination of color in 
samples (APHA, 1995). These include the visual comparison, spectrophoto-metric, tristimulus, ADMI (American Dye Manufacturer Institute) tristimu-lus, and alternate ADMI methods. Quantitative methods to determine the concentration of dyes include thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and high-performance capil-lary electrophoresis. Other methods are HPLC and electrochemical detectors and cathode stripping voltammetry.
10.3 LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS
Regulatory agencies are concerned with environmental and public health 
related to discharge of efﬂ  uents from the textile and dyestuff industries and 
wastewater treatment systems to water bodies. Imposition of stringent envi-ronmental legislation in the United Kingdom, United States, and most devel-oping countries has caused an increased problem for the textile and dye industries. State and federal agencies in the United States (McCurdy et al., 1992) require color limits of <200 ADMI units. The U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency’s toxic release inventory has calculated an annual dis-charge of approximately 2200 kg of four hazardous dyes to publicly owned treatment works (USEPA, 1993). In addition, the color standards in different states may vary within different localities, based on the receiving water quality. The Alabama dye waste discharge permit does not allow more than 50 ADMI units in the downstream color in the receiving river above the upstream color (Kennedy et al., 1992). In Virginia, color should not exceed 2000 ADMI units for efﬂ  uent discharge into a municipal wastewater treat-
ment plant (Ganesh et al., 1994).
During the past decade, color standards have been established in various 
parts of the world. In Germany, color standards for textile efﬂ  uent are based 
on the absorbance measurements for three wavelengths and are calculated by a formula (Gahr et al., 1994). In Italy, the regulatory agencies require unde-tectable color when diluted 1 : 2 for certain receiving water bodies (Rozzi et al., 1999). The National Rivers Authority (UK Environmental Agency) requires “water-white” discharges in the textile industry, and even at present, many textile dye industries are experiencing problems in compliance. The absorbance values for the river quality of a ﬁ  ltered sample for seven wave-
lengths are established in the form of regulatory standards and consent levels (Churchley, 1994). In the United Kingdom, color removal from textile efﬂ  u-
ent is regulated by the Environment Agency (EA) and the Scottish Environ-m e n t a l  P r o t e c t i o n  A g e n c y  ( S E P A )  ( W i l l m o t t  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 8 ) .  D e n m a r k  h a s  forbidden the use of several azocolorants in textiles and toys due to potential formation of aromatic amines (DEPA, 1998). The new European Community (EC) regulations focus on the economic front of the discharge of dye waste-waters. In addition, European Council Directive 96/61/EC (Shaw, 1998) and the U.S. Pollution Prevention Act recommend end-of-pipe treatment to combat difﬁ  cult-to-treat dye wastewaters. The Australian Dye Company and 
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) are also working on cleaner production. In Taiwan, an ADMI standard of 550 at three wavelengths is necessary for discharge.
10.4 ALTERNATIVE DECOLORIZATION 
TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES
In recent years, worldwide efforts have been employed to develop more effec-
tive color removal processes. However, no universal method is known for the treatment of dye wastewaters because of the complex and varied chemical structure of these compounds. Research in the past two decades has focused on the complexity of decolorization techniques of dye efﬂ  uents. The dye 
concentrations of different classes in wastewaters have been recorded (Uygur, 1997). The characteristics of dyehouse wastewater, including alkalinity, COD, and BOD, are described by Kothandaraman et al. (1976). Several treatments are recognized related to decolorization of the textile or dye-containing wastewaters, and these are listed in Table 10.1. Various physical, chemical, electrochemical, photocatalytic, and biological processes, including bacterial bioreactors, are described along with possible mechanisms of action and various examples related to dye decolorization and degradation (Hao et al., 2000). Current treatment technologies for the remediation of dyes in textile efﬂ uent have also been illustrated with effective and cheaper alternatives for 
dye decolorization and removal on a large scale (Robinson et al., 2001a).
10.4.1 Physicochemical Methods
Physical, chemical, and electrochemical methods produce a large volume of 
sludge. These methods also exhibit noticeable differences in color removal, volume capability, duration of operation, and capital cost. Color in large volumes of wastewaters can be removed rapidly by membrane technology and ozone treatment, but the capital cost is high. Phthalocyanine dyes are quite stable in advanced oxidation processes, such as TiO
2/UV, Fenton, and photo-
Fenton reagents (Arslan and Bacioglu, 1999). Ultrasonic approach for min-eralization of dye is also demonstrated (Vinodgopal et al., 1998). Dyes can be removed more effectively by magnesium chloride than by alum and ALTERNATIVE DECOLORIZATION TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES 423TABLE 10.1 Methods for Decolorization of Dye-Containing Wastewaters

10.4.2 Biological Methods
10.4.2.1 Degradation by Bacteria.  Presently, most of the textile indus-
tries are developing wastewater remediation technologies on-site in order to discharge below the criteria limits. A variety of bacterial bioreactors have been proposed to obtain an effective continuous anaerobic/aerobic treatment of dyes. These include (1) aerobic activated-sludge or rotating bioﬁ  lm reac-
tors (Shaul et al., 1991; Jiang and Bishop, 1994); (2) anaerobic ﬁ  xed-ﬁ  lm 
ﬂ uidized-bed reactors followed by aerobic suspended-bed activated sludge 
reactors (Seshadri et al., 1994; Fitzgerald and Bishop, 1995); (3) semicontinu-ous anaerobic reactors (Mass and Chaudhari, 2005); (4) anaerobic upﬂ  ow 
ﬁ xed-bed columns with aerobic agitated tanks (An et al., 1996; Rajaguru et 
al., 2000); (5) aerobic–anaerobic sequential batch or continuous-ﬂ  ow reactors 
(Oxspring et al., 1986; Loyd et al., 1992; Ganesh et al., 1994); (6) combina-tion of anaerobic and aerobic rotating drum reactors (Harmer and Bishop, 1992; Sosath and Libra, 1997); (7) anoxic–aerobic sequential bioreactors (Khehra et al., 2006); and (8) fed-batch column reactors (Kapdan and Oztekin, 2003).
Several genera and species of bacteria have been established for dye decol-
orization. Bacteria show inferior decolorizing capabilities for triphenylmeth-ane than that for azo dyes. The decolorization capability is correlated to the molecular weight and octanol–water partition coefﬁ  cient. Reverse decoloriza-
tion also happens upon exposure of anaerobic degradation products to oxygen. Due to the speciﬁ  city of bacteria, they cannot be employed in degradation of 
dye mixtures in wastewaters. Bacterial peroxidases, cometabolic reductive cleavage by aerobic bacteria as the sole source of carbon and energy, aerobic reductases, anaerobic reduction and its mechanism, and anaerobic/aerobic treatment of azo dyes have been summarized by Stolz (2001).
10.4.2.2 Degradation by Actinomycetes.  A soil actinomycete, Streptomy-
ces chromofuscus , exhibits less decolorization than the white-rot fungus Pha-
nerochaete chrysosporium  ( P a s z c zyn s ki  e t  al . ,  1 992 ).  S e v e r al  a c t in o m y ce t e  
strains decolorize the reactive dyes, including azo, anthraquinone, and phtha-locyanine, through adsorption (Zhou and Zimmermann, 1993). Pseudomo-
nas luteola  completely degrades the reactive azo dyes (e.g., RBB, RP
2B, and 
V2RP), whereas the azo bond is cleaved for the Red G dye (Hu, 1994). The 
degradation product of Crystal Violet by both actinomycetes is Michler’s ketone (MK). Methyl Violet, Ethyl Violet, Basic Fuchsin, and Victoria Blue are also decolorized.

Several species of Chlorella  and Oscillatoria  degrade azo dyes to aromatic 
amines and eventually, biotransform to simpler organic compounds or CO 2.
Some species exhibit the ability to utilize azo dyes as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. These algae can be added to stabilization ponds for the elimina-tion of aromatic amines. The sulfonated anthraquinones are removed via uptake and transformation by free rhubarb ( Rheum palmatum ) cells grown 
in bioreactors after 20 days (Schwitzguebel and Vanek, 2003). It appears that certain enzymes of rhubarb involved in this transformation can be harnessed in the development of a biological process to treat wastewater from the dye and detergent industries.
10.5 FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND 
DEGRADATION OF DYES
During the past decade, fungi have been demonstrated to degrade various 
classes of dyes. It is a good alternative to replace or supplement present treatment processes. Fungal treatment of dyes is an economical and feasible method for decolorizing textile wastewaters. The state of the art on microbial dye decolorization and biodegradation also encompasses the role of fungi and white-rot fungi (Banat et al., 1996). Fungal decolorization and degrada-t i o n  o f  d y e s  an d  d y e  w a s t e w a t e r  h a v e  b e e n  d e s c ri b e d  b y  s o m e  r e s e ar c h e r s  (Hao et al., 2000; Fu and Viraraghavan, 2001; Knapp et al., 2001). Fungal decolorization and degradation of different types of dyes are noted in Table 10.2.
10.5.1 Azo Dyes
Azo dyes constitute the most versatile and largest class of synthetic dyes 
employed commercially in the textile and food industries. More than 2000 different azo dyes are used to dye various materials, such as textile, leather, plastic, cosmetics, and food. These are characterized by the presence of one or more azo bonds (-N< => N - )  i n  a s s o c i a t i o n  w i t h  o n e  o r  m o r e  a r o m a t i c  
systems that may also carry sulfonic acid groups. These are also the most common class of dyes released into aquatic and terrestrial environments through the efﬂ  uents, resulting in the contamination of rivers and ground-
waters. Cationic dyes are more toxic, followed by anionic acid and direct dyes. Azo dyes used in degradation by Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
(Spadaro et al., 1992), except 4-phenylazophenol and 4-phenylazo-2-methoxyphenol, are considered toxic by the U.S. Environmental Protection A g e n c y  ( Lo wry  an d  Lo wry ,  1 988 ).  P. chrysosporium  also degrades textile 
dyes with bioaccessible groups such as guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol) and syringol (2,6-dimethoxyphenol) (Martins et al., 2001). Degradation of azo dyes by P. chrysosporium  is enhanced by introducing a guaiacol substitu-
ent into the chemical structure of the dye, thus making it more amenable to TABLE 10.2 Fungal Decolorization and Degradation of Dyes

fungal degradation of azo dyes has been reviewed by Bumpus (1995) and Stolz (2001).
Congo dye is tightly adsorbed to mycelial pellets of P. chrysosporium  in 
both ligninolytic and nonligninolytic cultures, but the dye is substantially degraded in ligninolytic cultures (Tatarko and Bumpus, 1998). The fruiting bodies of basidiomycete fungi growing on rotting wood decolorize a wide range of structurally different synthetic dyes (Knapp et al., 1995). Differences in decolorization of dyes may be attributed to steric factors, electron distribu-t i o n ,  a n d  c h a r g e  d e n s i t y .  B i o d e g r a d a t i o n  i s  e n h a n c e d  d u e  t o  v e r y  s p e c i ﬁ  c 
structural changes in the dye molecules. Under certain conditions, incomplete decolorization depends on the chemical structure of dye molecules. Of 26 white-rot fungi, 10 strains decolorize all structurally different dyes and produce laccase, lignin peroxidase (LiP), and manganese peroxidase (MnP) on solid medium (Levin et al., 2004). Pretreatment of Aspergillus niger  dead 
biomass with NaHCO
3 removes nearly 90% of Congo Red in 42 hours at pH 
6 (Fu and Viraraghavan, 2002). Biosorption of Congo Red follows the Lager-gren ﬁ  rst-order (Ho et al ., 1996) and pseudo-second-order rate equations and 
the Radke–Prausnitz model.

during transformation of Hydrolyzed Reactive Violet 5 (HRV 5) (Heinﬂ  ing 
et al., 1997). Strict secondary metabolism in strain Trametes versicolor  CNPR 
8107 was not necessary to produce ligninolytic enzymes (Toh et al., 2003). Low levels of MnP and laccase were detected after the completion of most of the decolorization of Reactive Black 5 by Irpex lacteus (Maximo and Costa-
Ferreira, 2004). MnP, Mn-independent peroxidase (MIP), and laccase of Geotrichum sp. are involved in the transformation of Reactive Black 5 
(Maximo et al., 2003). Additional enzymes or factors appear to be involved in the decolorization of Reactive Red 158 and Reactive Yellow 27. Aspergillus 
foetidus  shows similar yields in the presence or absence of Drimarene dyes, 
implying tolerance in the presence of dyes and for growth (Sumathi and Manju, 2000). P. chrysosporium  cultures produce the highest activities of 
MnP and β-glucosidase and thus incline towards the involvement of these 
enzymes in the degradation of these dyes (Chagas and Durrant, 2001). Pleu-
rotus sajor-caju  produces laccase active toward o-dianisidine, and glucose-1-
oxidase may participate in the degradation process. Decolorization of Congo Red coincides with the formation of MnP of I. lacteus  in a low-nitrogen 
mineral medium (Novotny et al., 2001). Crude exoenzyme MnP preparations from P. chrysosporium  d e c o l o r i z e  D i r e c t  G r e e n  6 ,  C h r y s o p h e n i n e ,  a n d

D u r i n g  solid-state fermentation, decolorization of structurally different dyes is related to the high laccase activity of Pleurotus pulmonarius  ( T y c h a n o w i c z  e t  a l . ,

Little is known about the fate of efﬂ  uents from the chemical manufacturing 
industries. Highly colored diazo-linked chromophore in the efﬂ  uent is present 
for the manufacture of nitrated stilbene–sulfonic acids (NSSA). The efﬂ  uent 
also contains high levels of sodium chloride and sodium sulfate. Diazo-linked chromophore industrial efﬂ  uent is decolorized by white-rot fungi (Knapp and 
Newby, 1999). The rates of decolorization are similar for all fungi in both salted and unsalted portions of the efﬂ  uent. Such results have a potential for 
use in treating chemical industry wastes.
10.5.2 Phthalocyanine Dyes
Phthalocyanine dyes are widely used in the textile and dyestuff industries, 
but little is known about the decolorization and biodegradation of these com-pounds by microorganisms. B. adusta  and T. versicolor  reduced nickel about 
30% at an initial H y drolyzed Reactiv e Blue 38 (HRB 38) concen tration of 200 mg/l (Heinﬂ  ing et al., 1997). During transformation, these fungi show 
signiﬁ  cant reduction in the toxicity of HRB 38 to Vibrio ﬁ  scheri. After 7 days, 
the EC
50 values were reduced to 9 ( B. adusta ) and 8 ( T. versicolor ) from 37. 
Five out of seven fungal isolates decolorized above 90% of Cu-phthalocya-nine tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (Knapp et al., 1995). I. lacteus  attained 
98% decolorization of copper-phthalocyanine (CuPc) and showed the pres-ence of MnP in liquid media (Novotny et al., 2001 ). Signiﬁ  cant amounts of 
LiP or MnP activity were not detected during the decolorization of CuPc by P. chrysosporium  PC671 (Conneely et al., 1999). This suggests little or no 
correlation between the production of ligninolytic enzymes and decoloriza-tion of this dye.
10.5.3 Anthraquinone Dyes
Both tropho- and idiophasic cultures of Trametes trogii  BAFC 463 produce 
high levels of laccase activity under all conditions and may be related to decolorization of Anthraquinone Blue (Levin et al., 2001). T. versicolor
degrades Acid Green 27 faster by extracellular than by intracellular enzymes (Wang and Yu, 1998). Five species of white-rot fungi decolorize Remazol Brilliant Blue R (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999a). Of 115 strains, 16 strains showed fast decolorization of Basic Blue 22 within 5 to 8 days (Jarosz-Wilko-lazka et al., 2002). Two mitosporic fungi, Pestalotia  sp. and Tolypocladium
sp., produced an extracellular oxidative system and decolorized the dye within 11 days. Flavodon ﬂ  avus  decolorized several synthetic dyes (i.e., Azure B, 
Brilliant Green, Congo Red, Crystal Violet, and Remazol Brilliant Blue R) in a low-nitrogen medium (Raghukumar, 2000). Pleurotus pulmonarius
decolorized 97% of Remazol Brilliant Blue R in corncob solid-state fermen-tation after 6 days (T ychanowicz et al., 2004).10.5.4 Heterocyclic Dyes
Little is known about color removal of heterocyclic dyes. This may be due to 
the fact that these dyes are not used extensively in the textile industries. P. 
chrysosporium  completely decolorized Azure B in a nitrogen-limited medium 
and 60% in a nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient medium (Cripps et al., 1990). The non-
ligninolytic medium revealed 14% of Azure B adsorbed to the fungal mycelia. Three isolates of fungi removed more than 95% of the color of Neutral Red (Knapp et al., 1995). I. lacteus  decolorized Fluorescein and Methylene Blue 
co m p l e t e l y  o n  s o li d  m e di a  (N o v o tn y  e t  al . ,  200 1 ).  P arti al  d eco l o riza ti o n  o f  Methylene Blue occurs due to Pleurotus pulmonarius  in solid-state cultures 
(T ychanowicz et al., 2004).
10.5.5 Indigo Dyes
All fungal isolates of wood-rotting fungi remove about 99% of the color of 
Indigo Carmine, as evident by drastic spectral changes (Knapp et al., 1995). T. versicolor  caused faster biodegradation of Indigo Carmine by intracellular 
enzymes or living mycelium containing intercellular enzymes (Wang and Yu, 1998). Decolorization was initiated in a few hours and P. chrysosporium ,
Pycnosporus sanguineus ,Pleurotus sajor-caju , and Phellinus gilvus  remove 
75 to 100% of Indigo dye, respectively, after 4 days (Balan and Monteiro, 2001).
10.5.6 Polymeric Dyes
Not much work has been performed on the fungal degradation of polymeric 
dyes. Again, this may be because they are used comparatively less in the textile industries. P. chrysosporium  decolorized three different polymeric 
dyes—Polymeric B-411, Polymeric R-481, and Polymeric Y-606—due to sec-ondary metabolism (Glenn and Gold, 1983). Trametes pocas ,T. cingulata ,T. 
versicolor , and isolate DSPM95 decolorized Poly R-478 extensively and 
revealed high MnP activities, respectively (Tekere et al., 2001). Isolate DSPM95 and T. versicolor  also showed high laccase activity and may be cor-
related with high dye decolorization. Of 17 strains of ﬁ  lamentous fungi 
belonging to 13 different species, living and dead mycelia of three species of Aspergillus  showed 100% decolorization of Poly R-478 after 17 days (Wunch 
et al., 1997). The extracellular ﬁ  ltrate of Laetiporus sulphureus  removed 68% 
of the color. Complete decolorization of Poly R-478 occurred in the presence of 0 and 5% acetone by Bjerkandera  sp. strain BOS55 (Field et al., 1995).
10.5.7 Triphenylmethane Dyes
Triphenylmethane dyes are employed extensively in various industries due to 
their versatility. Numerous applications of triphenylmethane dyes are well FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND DEGRADATION OF DYES 435436 FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND DEGRADATION OF DYES
known in the textile industries, such as dying cotton, nylon, silk, and wool. 
These dyes are also used in the paper and leather industries, and many are used as biological stains and in veterinary medicine. They are also used in coloring plastics, fats, oils, and waxes and have applications in the cosmetics and food industries. Some triphenylmethane dyes are used extensively in medicine as dermatological agents. The biodegradation of triphenylmethane dyes by fungi and other organisms has been described by Azmi et al. (1998). Ligninolytic and nonligninolytic cultures of P. chrysosporium  were found 
responsible for the degradation of several triphenylmethane dyes (Bumpus and Brock, 1988). Of six isolates, two strains of white-rot fungi, Wd1 and Id, enhanced the degradation of Crystal Violet and Brilliant Green to 36 and 62% and 44 and 46%, respectively, in the presence of Mn(II), H
2O2, and 
glucose (Tayal et al., 1999). This indicates that peroxidases are involved in the degradation. Decolorization of dyes appears to be related to high titers of laccase activity in Pleurotus pulmonarius  (T ychanowicz et al., 2004). Of 
three bird’s nest fungi, Cyathus bulleri  is the most efﬁ  cient in decolorization 
of triphenylamine dyes, coinciding with the maximum activity of laccase (Vasdev et al., 1995). Four of seven isolates of white-rot fungi decolorized Brilliant Green completely (Knapp et al., 1995).
10.6 YEAST DECOLORIZATION AND DEGRADATION OF DYES
Little is known of dye degradation and color removal by yeasts. Table 10.3 
indicates the decolorization and degradation of dyes by yeasts. The two oxida-tive yeasts Rhodotorula  sp. and  R. rubra  degraded Crystal Violet completely 
in liquid broth after 4 days (Kwasniewska, 1985). The azo dyes can be elimi-nated from industrial efﬂ  uents using yeast biomass (Angelis and Rodrigues, 
1987). The percent color removal was reduced with an increasing initial con-centration of azo dye efﬂ  u e n t s .  A  s t r a i n  o f  y e a s t ,  Candida zeylanoides ,
degraded a number of simple azo dyes in liquid aerated batch bioreactors (Martins et al., 1999). Ignoring the differences in incubation periods, color loss using the Biolab batch bioreactor correlates well with that using shaken cultures. Metanilic acid is the reduction product (aminobenzenesulfonate) for azo dyes I and III, and sulfanilic acid for azo dyes II and IV by Candida zey-
lanoides  ( R a m a l h o  e t  a l . ,  2 00 2 ).  O t h e r  r e d u c t i o n  p r o d u c t s  a r e  1 - a m i n o - 2 -
naphthol and N,N-dimethyl- para -phenylenediamine, which are unstable in 
aerated solutions. This indicates that the yeast cleaves the reduction of azo bonds, producing amines. This behavior is also known in decolorizing anaero-bic or facultative aerobic bacteria. Saccharomyces cerevisiae  is a good candi-
date for dye removal in molasses media (Aksu, 2003). Biosorption of textile dyes occurs by biomass derived from the thermotolerant ethanol-producing yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus  IM B3 (Bustard et al., 1998) . Actively growing 
K. marxianus  IMB3 yeast cells under aerobic conditions almost completely 
decolorized Remazol Black B within 24 hours at a pH between 3.5 and 5.0 TABLE 10.3 Yeast Decolorization and Degradation of Dyes

(Meehan et al., 2000). Temperature has a signiﬁ  cant effect on decolorization, 
and an optimum temperature is 37ºC. Magnetically modiﬁ  ed brewer’s yeast, 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  subsp. uvarum  cells, efﬁ  ciently adsorbs several 
water-soluble dyes (Safarikova et al., 2005).
10.7 WHITE-ROT FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND 
DEGRADATION OF DYES
The role of the white-rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium  in the deg-
radation of polymeric dyes was ﬁ  rst established by Glenn and Gold (1983). 
Since then, several papers have appeared on the use of P. chrysosporium  in 
the decolorization and degradation of dyes. In addition, other white-rot fungi (e.g., Trametes versicolor ,Pleurotus ostreatus , and Bjerkandera  sp.) have also 
been found to be efﬁ  cient in degrading dyes. Several reports indicate the 
superiority of species of Trametes  and Bjerkandera over P. chrysosporium
in the rate and extent of decolorization of different dyes. A process has been patented for decolorizing dye efﬂ  uent using white-rot fungi to absorb, degrade, 
and remove the color of efﬂ  uent (Shen et al., 1992). The role of many white-
rot fungi in dye decolorization and degradation was presented in the foregoing paragraphs. Based on current knowledge, it appears that about 50% of our knowledge of dye decolorization and degradation comes from white-rot fungi.
A fungal and chemical treatment using the sequence Phanerochaete chrys-
osporium –ozone suggests good decolorization, total phenols, and molecular 
mass reductions in textile efﬂ  u e n t  ( K u n z  e t  a l . ,  2 00 1 ).  D e c o l o r i z a t i o n  w a s  
mainly through adsorption until day 6 and was related to the LiP activity between days 6 and 9. The toxicity of the textile efﬂ  uent was reduced using 
Scenedesmus subspicatus  and Escherichia coli , showing no inhibition at the 
end of the treatment.
10.8 MECHANISMS OF FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND 
DEGRADATION OF DYES
Colored textile wastewater contains a mixture of different aromatic dyes that 
are difﬁ  cult to degrade. A wide range of pH and high salt concentrations of 
chlorides add more problems. Several synthetic dyes are resistant to microbial degradation and cannot be removed easily in conventional wastewater treat-ment systems. Shortcomings of both physicochemical and biological methods limit their large-scale applications in dye decolorization. Great interest is shown in a number of fungi, especially the versatile white-rot fungi, which have been explored to metabolize a wide range of recalcitrant organic pollut-ants. Possible mechanisms of fungal decolorization and degradation of dyes are listed in Table 10.4.A variety of synthetic dyes have been found to be decolorized and degraded 
by fungi. Extracellular enzymes such as LiP and MnP are involved in the biodegradation of dyes as well as in color removal. The extent of dye removal depends on the degree of dye complexity, nitrogen limitation/availability, and the enzymatic activity in the medium. Increases in LiP and MnP enhanced decolorization under nitrogen-limited conditions. Higher rates of decoloriza-tion were achieved when the strains were cultivated in nitrogen-rich media, while no or slower decolorization occurred with strains cultivated in low-nitrogen media (Chao and Lee, 1994). Laccases are another group of enzymes involved in the biodegradation of dyes. Veratryl alcohol (VA) also appears to enhance ligninolytic activity and links to decolorization activity.
In addition to enzymatic degradation by white-rot fungi, the color of 
aqueous dyes can be removed through both adsorption and degradation by fungi. Adsorption has been called the mechanism of decolorization of a wide range of dye wastewater by several species of Myrothecium  and Ganoderma
(Mou et al., 1991). The process is insensitive to the variations in pH and high salt concentrations and is not bound by the particular mycelium of several fungal species and genera. A dye adsorption mechanism can be exploited in the treatment process for the removal and recovery of dyes from wastewater.
Myrothecium verrucaria  binds strongly to azo dyes for rapid decolorization 
(Brahimi-Horn et al., 1992). Dyes bound to fungal biomass can be recovered by soniﬁ  cation or Triton X or extraction with methanol. The decolorization 
capability of P. chrysosporium  and other decolorizing fungi and of Candida 
sp. related to dye concentration, percent removal/time, and possible mecha-nism has been discussed by Banat et al. (1996). Astrazon Red FBL decolor-izes through adsorption by Funalia trogii  pellets at the initial stage, followed 
by decolorization through microbial metabolism (Yesilada et al., 2002). Decolorization of Acid Dye 183 by three fungi (Jarosz-Wilkolazka et al., 2002) and of Amaranth, New Coccine, and Orange G by P. chrysosporium
and Pleurotus sajor-caju  (Chagas and Durrant, 2001) may be attributed to 
either adsorption on the fungal biomass or degradation.
The fate of adsorbed dye can be classiﬁ  ed into three categories: (1) binding 
with the hyphal structures, (2) physical desorption to the solution, and (3) enzymatic degradation by living hyphal structures (Wang and Yu, 1998). The structure of individual dyes contributes to the adsorption ability and afﬁ  nity TABLE 10.4 Mechanisms of Fungal Dye

to fungal hyphae. The nonspeciﬁ  c biouptake process of adsorption is rapid 
and noncatholic to dye structures and adaptable to diverse types of textile wastewater. Physical desorption and enzymatic degradation can regenerate dye-saturated mycelium for the next adsorption. The fastest regeneration is obtained by the living mycelium plus extracellular enzymes. This mechanism is indicative of sequential adsorption and degradation of dyes by living fungal mycelium for the continuous treatment of efﬂ  uent by Trametes versicolor . An 
interior region of rapidly settling spherical biomass pellets of Aspergillus 
foetidus  shows strong bioadsorption rather than biotransformation of dyes 
(Sumathi and Manju, 2000). The presence of carboxylic and amino groups in Rhodamine B contributes to lower sorption using dead macrofungi, Fomes 
fomentarius  and Phellinus igniarius  (Maurya et al., 2006).
Mineralization of dyes rarely occurs during degradation by fungi. Miner-
alization (23 to 48%) of certain substituted radiolabeled azo dyes was reached after 12 days of addition using P. chrysosporium  ( S p a d a r o  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 2 ) .  
Higher mineralization occurs in dyes containing aromatic rings substituents, such as amino, acetamido, hydroxy, or nitro functions than unsubstituted rings. Most dyes degrade more extensively under nitrogen-limiting conditions than under nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient conditions.
During the last decade, there have been reports on the utilization of dyes 
as the sole source of carbon by fungi. These fungi do not contribute to the process of dye decolorization (Marchant et al., 1994; Nigam et al., 1995a,b). Certain bonds of dyes are cleaved in order to utilize them as carbon sources, but the chromophore is not affected. This type of behavior is prevalent when dye-degraders and dye-decolorizers are present in a consortium of microor-ganisms. The mutual relationship of dye-degraders and dye-decolorizers can lead to faster or complete degradation of dyes.
10.9 METABOLIC PRODUCTS AND PATHWAYS
Little is known on the formation of metabolic products and elucidation of 
pathways of dye degradation by fungi. However, metabolic products due to dye degradation by fungi are noted in Table 10.5. Three products appear during the sequential N-demethylation of Crystal Violet by P. chrysosporium
(Bumpus and Brock, 1988). Two additional unidentiﬁ  ed colored Crystal 
Violet metabolites were also found as a result of continued degradation, and ultimately, Crystal Violet degrades to a colorless product. Demethylation of Crystal Violet is also expressed with a H
2O2-generating system in the extra-
cellular ﬂ  uid. Brilliant Green, Ethyl Violet, and Malachite Green contain 
N-alkyl groups, and thus initial oxidation of these dyes proceeds via 
N-demethylation in a manner similar to Crystal Violet. Bromophenol Blue, Cresol Red, and Pararosaniline contain no alkyl groups, and therefore oxidation of these dyes involves a mechanism different from that of Crystal Violet. This indicates the presence of LiP, which is nonspeciﬁ  c in TABLE 10.5 Fungal Decolorization and Degradation of Dyes and Metabolic Products

nature. Biodegradation of Azure B and Tropaeolin O in both nitrogen-limited 
and nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient cultures of P. chrysosporium  results in the formation 
of colored metabolites (Cripps et al., 1990). A metabolite of Congo Red was found only in nitrogen-sufﬁ  cient cultures.
Sulfophthalimides (3- and 4-SPIs) were identiﬁ  ed as the major metabolites 
during decolorization of the sulfophthalocyanine (SPC) textile dyes Reactive Blue 15 (RB 15) and Reactive Blue 38 (RB 38) by Bjerkandera adusta  (Hein-
ﬂ ing-Weidtmann et al., 2001). HPLC with diode-array detection and HPLC-
MS proved that SPIs are produced from both dyes in fungal cultures and by action with its puriﬁ  ed MnP and LiP. The isomeric ratio of 3- and 4-SPI was 
about 3 : 1 during RB 15 decolorization. Cunninghamella elegans  transformed 
Malachite Green up to 54 μm with a ﬁ  rst-order rate constant of 0.029 μM/h 
per milligram of cells (Cha et al., 2001). Loss of color indicated that Malachite Green is reduced enzymatically to its Leucomalachite Green (LMG). Mala-chite Green is also converted to N-demethylated and N-oxidized metabolites, including primary and secondary arylamines. The peaks of metabolites cor-respond to mono-, di-, and tridesmethyl derivatives of Malachite Green and mono-, di-, tri-, and tetradesmethyl derivatives of LMG. The metabolites extracted from the culture supernatants and from mycelium-extracted samples were similar, except for Malachite Green N-oxide, which was detected only 
in the mycelia. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors suggest that the cytochrome P450 system mediates the N-demethylation and reduction reactions. This study showed that C. elegans  has multiple pathways to transform triphenylmethane 
dyes by an intracellular cytochrome P450 system. The mechanism proposed for the metabolism of Malachite Green and Leucomalachite Green is shown in Figure 10.1.
Decolorization of Rose Bengal is due to adsorption to mycelium and action 
by LiP of P. chrysosporium  (Gogna et al., 1992). One unidentiﬁ  ed metabolite 
was detected in 0 to 5 hours. Similarly, one unknown metabolite was detected in the supernatants and mycelia of four ligninolytic basidiomycete fungi ( P. 
chrysosporium ,Phellinus gilvus ,Pleurotus sajor-caju , and Pycnosporus san-
guineus ) due to Indigo dye degradation as the source of carbon (Balan and 
Monteiro, 2001). Trametes versicolor  decolorized all different substituted 
bioaccessible reactive azo dyes efﬁ  ciently after 7 days (Martins et al., 2003). 
Laccase, lower LiP activity, and glyoxal oxidase (GLOX) residual activity were detected. Decolorization of Cm-s resulted in the formation of two hydroxyl-
ated metabolites, meta -hydroxybenzoic acid and meta -benzyl alcohol. A meta-
bolic pathway has been proposed based on the hydroxylated metabolites.
10.10 FACTORS AFFECTING FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND 
DEGRADATION OF DYES
The characteristics of dye wastewater are very important for the process of 
decolorization. A fungus may decolorize one dye and has a different capacity for other dyes. Factors such as media composition, pH, carbon and nitrogen sources, TOC/N ratio, incubation time, ionic strength, and initial dyestuff 
concentrations have a profound effect on the rate of color removal and the process of biodegradation (Table 10.6). These factors are described below.

ized these dyes in 5 to 6 days on Kirk’s medium.
10.10.2 Static Versus Agitated Culture Conditions
Oxidative enzymes of white-rot fungi are responsible for biodegradation, 
which functions optimally in the presence of 100% oxygen (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999a). In static cultures, a surface mat limited oxygen transfer to the cells beneath the surface and in the medium. An agitated approach is practical for the treatment of a large volume of wastewater. Geotrichum  sp. 
CCMI 1019 revealed the most favorable decolorization rates of reactive azo dyes at 28ºC and agitation rates of 120 rpm (Maximo et al., 2003). Irpex 
lacteus  showed higher lev els of LiP , MnP , and laccase in stationary than in 
submerged cultures (Kasinath et al., 2003). MnP plays a major role in the decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Blue R. MnP and laccase of I. lacteus
appear to be involved in the decolorization of anthraquinone and azo dyes in shallow stationary cultures (Novotny et al., 2004).
10.10.3 pH and Temperature
Trametes versicolor  and isolate DSPM95 maintained the degradation of Poly 
R-478 over a wide range of pH, up to pH 6.0 (Tekere et al., 2001). Decoloriza-tion was not affected by pH (Chagas and Durrant, 2001). The pH range 3 to 10 was shown to have no correlation with dye adsorption (Mou et al., 1991; Brahimi-Horn et al., 1992). Buffers and pH inﬂ  uenced the decolorization of 
several dyes by T. versicolor  (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999a). Decolorization of 
all dyes, as the ﬁ  rst or second dye, occurred due to 2,2 ′-dimethyl succinate 
(2,2′-DMS) buffer. The ineffectiveness of buffers such as citrate–phosphate 
and sodium tartrate may be due in part to their consumption as carbon sources. The addition of dye caused the loss of buffering capacity by all buffers except 2,2 ′-DMS. A pH value of 5 reduced the efﬁ  ciency to 80% and 
a pH between 6 and 7 reduced it to 50% (Kapdan et al., 2000). Various textile and dye efﬂ  uents are produced at relatively high temperatures, between 50 
and 60ºC, and thus temperature is an important factor in dye decolorization. An optimum temperature for the growth of isolates ranges from 25 to 37ºC (Tekere et al., 2001). T. versicolor  CNPR 8107 decolorized Remazol Blue RR 
a t a highe r ra te a t 30ºC than a t 37ºC 2 da ys afte r dy e addi ti on (T oh e t al., 2003).
10.10.4 C and N Sources, TOC/N Ratios, and Salts
Biodegradation of the dyes can be enhanced by improving the initial cultural 
conditions. In one study, the optimum concentration of glucose was 15 g/l for FACTORS AFFECTING FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION 447decolorization of nitrated stilbene–sulfonic acid efﬂ  uent by Coriolus versi-
color  (Knapp and Newby, 1999). Color removal of Congo Red was suppressed 
with a high dose of nutrient nitrogen (Tatarko and Bumpus, 1998). Nitrogen had no effect on the decolorization of dyes by Cyathus bulleri  (Vasdev et al., 
1995). More effective decolorization also occured in the presence of yeast extract (Zhou and Zimmermann, 1993).
A glucose concentration of 0.3% produced a strong effect on decoloriza-
tion, and the organic nitrogen in the efﬂ  uent was adequate for the process by 
Aspergillus niger  (Assadi and Jahangiri, 2001). An inoculum size of up to 
10% rapidly enhanced the rate of decolorization. Urea performed better (98%) color removal than did ammonium salts for the decolorization of Everzol Turquoise Blue G by Coriolus versicolor MUCL (Kapdan et al., 
2000). Almost complete color removal occurred at TOC/N ratios between 112 and 22, or glucose concentrations between 5000 and 1000 mg/l after 6 days. Glucose, starch, maltose, and cellobiose were shown to be good carbon sources for decolorization of the cotton bleaching efﬂ  uent by an unidentifed 
white-rot fungus (Zhang et al., 1999). However, the decolorization rate was lowered by the addition of NH
4+. Sucrose or both sucrose and peptone sig-
niﬁ cantly enhanced the decolorization of the reactive azo dyes by Cunning-
hamella elegans  UCP 542 (Ambrosio and Campos-Takaki, 2004). However, 
the presence of only nitrogen in the solutions suppressed the decolorization. P. chrysosporium  c a u s e d  m a x i m u m  d e c o l o r i z a t i o n  o f  M e t h y l  V i o l e t  a t  a

5 ce lls/ml,  p H  4  t o  5 ,  a t  3 5ºC  (Ra dha  e t  al. ,  2005).  P e p t o n e  
supported better decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Violet by Coriolus ver-
sicolor  (Sanghi et al., 2006).
10.10.5 Initial Dye Concentration
It is important to optimize an initial dye concentration for color removal. This 
aspect was discussed in portions of the foregoing text. Higher dye concentra-tions are always toxic. The decolorization efﬁ  ciency was shown to be 100 and 
80% at a dyestuff concentration between 100–500 and 700–1200 mg/l, respec-tively, by C. versicolor  ( K a p d a n  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 0 ) .  O n l y  1 2 %  d e c o l o r i z a t i o n  
occurred at a dye concentration of 1650 mg/l. Pseudozyma rugulosa  Y- 48 and 
Candida krusei G-1 decolorized 99% of 200 mg/l Reactive Brilliant Red K-
2BP, respectively (Yu and Wen, 2005). Dye decolorization was reduced to 20% at a concentration of 1000 mg/l by these yeast strains.

light of different optimum operating conditions. The process is basically the 
removal of dye color in efﬂ  uents accompanied by degradation. Both processes 
can take place individually or simultaneously. White-rot fungi are used pri-marily in decolorization bioreactor systems, but their commercial applica-tions in large-scale decolorization treatments are not known at the present time. This is because of the lack of a bioreactor system providing a constant production of high amounts of ligninolytic enzymes under continuous optimum conditions and controlled growth of fungi. Little is known about decolorization bioreactor systems that use yeasts. Fungal decolorization and degradation bioreactors of dyes can be classiﬁ  ed into the types discussed 
below.
10.11.1 Rotating Drum, Stirred-Tank, and Membrane Bioreactors
A new bioreactor conﬁ  guration based on the standard rotating drum bioreac-
tor has been developed for the production of ligninolytic enzymes in semisolid c o n d i t i o n s  ( D o m i n g u e z  e t  a l . ,  2 00 1 ).  T h i s  c o n ﬁ  guration is suitable for the 
continuous production of high titers of LiP for a long time without operational problems. About 19% Poly R-478 was decolorized after 15 minutes by an extracellular ﬂ  uid of the bioreactor, containing mainly MnP of Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium .Trametes versicolor  decolorized three reactive dyes in a 
sequencing batch process in the presence of glucose over an extended period without supplementation by a new mycelium (Borchert and Libra, 2001). Decolorization is attributed to the production of peroxidases and can be reactivated continuously by sheering the suspended pellets. A mycelium of Coriolus versicolor  removed color (95%) and COD (75%) in a batch reactor, 
and fungal pellets could be used for eight cycles (Sanghi et al., 2006). Crystal Violet decolorized in a column bioreactor using Phanerochaete chrysospo-
rium  (Das et al., 1995). The peak decolorization was reached in 3 days with 
glucose compared to 4 to 6 days with sucrose. A membrane bioreactor using T. versicolor  combined with reverse osmosis was effective for decolorization 
and organic removal of dye wastewater (Kim et al., 2004).
10.11.2 Packed- and Fluidized-Bed Bioreactors
A wood-rotting fungus strain F29, an unidentiﬁ  ed basidiomycete, decolorized 
Orange II under agitated conditions (Knapp et al., 1997). The fungus showed retention of high degradative activities along with reuse of the mycelia and thus indicated its possible value in continuous bioreactor systems. Fungal strain F29 decolorized 95 to 99% Orange II in a continuous packed-bed and fed-batch ﬂ  uidized-bed bioreactor systems (Zhang et al., 1999). The fed-batch 
bioreactor consisted of a conical vessel (1-L working volume) with a lid and three tubes, each for media, sampling, and air outlet, respectively, and is shown in Figure 10.2. Orange II also decolorized in this bioreactor with the use of immobilized cells for 27 cycles for 2 months. No relationship existed between the laccase activity of T. versicolor  pellets and the rate of decoloriza-
tion of a metal-complexed dye, Grey Lanaset G, in a continuous ﬂ  uidized-bed 
bioreactor (Blanquez et al., 2004). The pellets became dark due to the dye adsorbed on the biomass. Degradation appeared to be related to intracellular enzyme activity.
10.11.3 Immobilized Bioreactors
In general, immobilized systems exhibit good biological activities and capa-
bilities for long-term operation. Decolorization of Poly R-478 and Poly S-119 has been attributed to LiP and MnP activities by an immobilized Chrysospo-
rium lignorum  CL1 in a 2-L airlift bioreactor or cultivated under static condi-
tions (Buckley and Dobson, 1998). A MnP activity of P. chrysosporium  was 
shown to be responsible for effective Orange II and Poly R-478 decolorization (Mielgo et al., 2001, 2002). Decolorization not only depends on the MnP activity of P. chrysosporium  but also on cofactors inﬂ  uencing the catalytic 
activity of this enzyme (Palma et al., 1999). Another cofactor, hydrogen per-oxide, plays a major role in decolorization efﬁ  ciency. Additional research on 
the discovery of new cofactors and their role in mechanism of decolorization evolves into new applications in the biotechnological processes by fungi. Figure 10.3 shows a ﬁ  xed-ﬁ  lm bioreactor system for continuous decolorization 
of Red 533 Dispersed dye using immobilized P.chrysosporium  cells (Yang 
and Yu, 1996b). The process can operate continuously for 10 to 20 days o r  m o r e  w i t h  a  d e c o l o r i z a t i o n  e f ﬁ  ciency exceeding 88% at an initial dye media

concentration of 250 ppm and 2 days of retention time. Irpex lacteus  immo-
bilized in a pine wood (PW) reactor decolorized Remazol Brilliant Blue R more rapidly (100% in 6 days) than did a polyurethane foam (PUF) reactor (Kasinath et al., 2003). MnP was produced ﬁ  ve times more in a PUF than in 
a PW reactor. Laccase activities were similar in both reactors. Both reactors also decolorized four different color bath efﬂ  uents. MnP and laccase activities 
were present during decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Blue R by Irpex 
lacteus  immobilized in pine wood (Novotny et al., 2004). Immobilized Funalia 
trogii  on Luffa cylindrica  sponge decolorized Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) com-
pletely at initial dye concentrations (15, 18, 34, and 61 mg/l) added to a 30-day-old culture medium (Mazmanci and Unyayar, 2005). However, complete decolorization occurred within 48 hours in media containing 96 and 125 mg/l. No carbon or nitrogen source in the media was necessary when Luffa cylin-
drica  was used for immobilization.
10.12 DECOLORIZATION AND DEGRADATION OF DYES BY 
FUNGAL ENZYMES
Present knowledge on decolorization of dyes by fungal enzymes is based on 
enzymes secreted by white-rot fungi. The extracellular enzymes include two peroxidases, LiP and MnP, and laccase. These enzymes can cleave the aro-matic rings and have the potential to remove color from the dyes. Commercial products of laccase are known, but LiP and MnP are not commercially avail-Gas outlet

dye molecules and may block attacking another dye structure.
10.12.1 Peroxidase-Catalyzed Decolorization and Degradation of Dyes
Lignin peroxidases are important enzymes of the lignin-degrading system 
and are involved in the degradation of dyes (Table 10.8). Azure B, Tropaeolin O, and Orange II were partially decolorized within 20 minutes by crude LiP during nitrogen-limited cultures of P. chrysosporium  ( Cri p ps  e t  al . ,  1 990).  
Isolated isozymes designated as H1, H2, H8, and H10 of LiP showed similar results of decolorization. Decolorization of dyes with crude LiP resulted in the formation of a number of metabolites. A number of differences exist between metabolites formed during decolorization of dyes by fungal cultures or with LiP. This suggests the expression of many enzymes or enzyme systems other than LiP during initial steps or biodegradation of dyes. The efﬁ  ciency 
of enzymatic decolorization was lower than that of the whole culture during mineralization of ﬁ  ve azo dyes and sulfanilic acid by P. chrysosporium  (Paszc-
zynski et al., 1992). LiP H8 of P. chrysosporium  cultures displayed the forma-
tion of a number of oxidation products upon incubation of Congo Red at pH 3.0 (Tatarko and Bumpus, 1998). The decolorization of dyes increased with higher LiP concentrations (Wu et al., 1996). The addition of VA enhanced the decolorization of Reactive Red 22 to 96% within 3 minutes. Isozymes of LiP from P. chrysosporium decolorized dyes in the presence of VA similar 
to crude LiP (Ollikka et al., 1993). LiP from Trametes versicolor  decolorized 
Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) in the presence or absence of V A (Chris-tian et al., 2005). Ho w e v er , V A stabilized and impro v ed the rate of RB B R decolorization. A mechanism has been described for the role of VA in the decolorization of RBBR by LiP.
LiP from P. chrysosporium  catalyzed the degradation of Methylene Blue 
and Azure B via N-demethylation oxidation (Ferreira et al., 2000). LiP oxidation of Methylene Blue produced nearly 70% of the mono- and dide-methylated derivatives Azure B and Azure A. A 1 : 10 dye : H

showed nearly 80% decolorization, suggesting its application in wastewater treatment. It has been shown that a crude exoenzyme preparations from Trametes versicolor  and Bjerkandera adusta  can decolorize Reactive Blue 
38 and Reactive Violet 5 (Heinﬂ  ing et al., 1997). MnP isozymes from B. 
adusta  and Pleurotus eryngii  decolorized azo dyes and phthalocyanine com-
plexes in a Mn(II)-independent reaction (Heinﬂ  ing et al., 1998). Dye oxida-
tions were enhanced by the addition of VA as in LiP reactions. Decolorization of Reactive Blue 15 accounted for 60% of sulfophthalimides by puriﬁ  ed MnP 
from B. adusta  (Heinﬂ  ing-Weidtmann et al., 2001). A scheme has been pro-
posed for the oxidative ﬁ  ssion of Reactive Blue 15 by peroxidases of B. 
adusta .

458LiP-catalyzed oxidation of sulfonated azo dye is shown in Figure 10.4. Two 
successive one-electron oxidations of the phenolic ring of azo dyes I, II, III, or IV by H
2O2-oxidized forms of LiP produce a carbonium ion. Water attacks 
the phenolic carbon of the azo linkage, forming an unstable hydroxy inter-mediate that breaks down to produce a quinone and sulfo- or sulfonamido-phenyldiazene. Phenyldiazene oxidizes by oxygen to produce a phenyldiazene radical that removes nitrogen to yield a sulfo- or sulfonamidophenyl radical. These radicals are scavenged by oxygen to form the corresponding phenyl hydroperoxides. P. chrysosporium  crude LiP oxidation of the sulfonated azo 
dye 4-(4 ′-sulfophenylazo)-2,6-dimethylphenol identiﬁ  es 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-
benzoquinone, 4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid, 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, and benzenesulfonic acid (Goszczynski et al., 1994). Oxidation of 4-(4 ′-sulfonamidophenylazo)-2-methoxyphenol yields 2-
methoxybenzoquinone, benzenesulfonamide, 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide, 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonamide, and 2-methoxy-4-aminophenol.
The rates of decolorization of all eight dyes was shown to increase linearly 
with the LiP doses, but the slopes depended on the dye structures (Young and Yu, 1997). Partially puriﬁ  ed LiP along with VA, H
2O2, and acidic pH 
(3.5 to 5) exhibited high rates of decolorization. The eight dyes can be classi-ﬁ ed into two groups based on the effect of H
2O2 on dye decolorization: One 
has an optimum H 2O2 concentration and decolorization declines with an 
overdose, and the other has an enhanced decolorization with high H 2O2 con-
centration. The nature of the substituents in dye affected the enzymatic activ-ity in fungi, and the hydroxyl and amino groups enhanced decolorization (Abadulla et al., 2000a). The presence of LiP and/or MnP in addition to laccase produced by Neurospora crassa ,Pleurotus ostreatus ,Schizophyllum 
commune , and Sclerotium rolfsii  enhanced up to 25% decolorization of all 
azo dyes, Acid Blue 72 (Indigo), Reactive Blue 10 (Anthraquinone), and Basic Red 9 Base (Triarylmethane). Various salts, such as sodium acetate and sodium chloride, reduced the decolorization and partially precipitated the proteins. Dyeing auxiliaries, such as Cibacel DBC, lowered the decolorization efﬁ ciency.
Seven fungal strains decolorized three structurally diverse dyes (Moreira 
et al., 2000). All seven fungi secrete MnP, and laccase activity was detected only in Phlebia radiata .P. ostreatus  produced an extracellular peroxidase that 
can decolorize Remazol Brilliant Blue R (Shin et al., 1997). This peroxidase decolorized eight different dyes, including triphenylmethane, heterocyclic, azo, and polymeric dyes, to a certain extent after 5 minutes (Shin and Kim, 1998). Some dyes were decolorized with a crude preparation of LiP from P. 
chrysosporium  so fast that it was difﬁ  cult to follow the kinetics of the enzy-
matic reaction (Podgornik et al., 1995). LiPs of P. chrysosporium  decolorized 
dyes of different structures and classes, regardless of their charge (Podgornik et al., 1999). In general, the maximum rate of decolorization was proportional to LiP activity, whereas the time of disappearance depended on both LiP activity and dye concentration.

reaction was not linear (Peralta-Zamora et al., 1999). Sulfonphthalein (SP) dyes were decolorized by MnP and manganese-independent peroxidase (MIP) of Pleurotus ostreatus  (Shrivastava et al., 2005). The MnP-catalyzed decolor-
izing activity for SP dyes is in the preferred order Phenol Red >ortho -Cresol 
Red >meta -Cresol Purple > Bromophenol Red > Bromocresol Purple > Bro-
mophenol Blue > Bromophenol Green. MIP-catalyzed decolorizing activity 
for SP dyes is in the order Bromocresol Green > Bromophenol Blue > Bro-

Little is known of the inﬂ  uence of dye concentration on the rate of color 
removal by peroxidases, but a general indication is that high dye concentra-tion is responsible for the slow rate of color removal. In general, the decolor-ization rate in all eight dyes was inhibited at high dye concentrations (Young and Yu, 1997). High dye concentration require more attacks by LiP radicals, due to a slower rate of color removal. Based on the molecular ratio of H
2O2
to dye, about 36 attacks of LiP compounds I and II will be required for the disappearance of color of Reactive Black 5. This implies that a plug-ﬂ  ow 
bioreactor containing bioﬁ  lters may not be efﬁ  cient in dye color removal, due 
to high inlet concentrations. Thus, a bioreactor with a controlled back-mixing ﬂ ow of wastewater is to be designed to cover the effects of substrate inhibition 
and H
2O2 overdose.
Poly R-478 has been decolorized in vivo by semisolid cultures of P. chryso-
sporium  using corncobs (Rodriguez Couto et al., 2000). About 85% Poly R-
478 (0.02 w/v) was decolorized using VA, and a lower percentage of 58% occurred in MnO
2 cultures. A correlation existed between decolorization of 
Poly R-478 and MnP activity. Little activity of MnP was involved in dye decolorization, suggesting that Mn(III) is a less efﬁ  cient oxidative agent than 
LiP cation radicals (compounds I and II) (Young and Yu, 1997).
Anthraquinone dye could be decolorized in shaken ﬂ  asks after 7 days by 
Geotrichum candidum  Dec 1 (Kim and Shoda, 1999a). A novel peroxidase 
(DyP) involved in the decolorization of dyes produced by Geotrichum can-
didum  Dec 1 was puriﬁ  ed and described by Kim and Shoda (1999b). Nine of 
the 21 dyes, especially the anthraquinone dyes decolorized by Dec 1 cells, were also decolorized by DyP .
10.12.1.1 Peroxidase Bioreactors.  The use of enzyme-based treatment of 
dyes in wastewaters is rather new and unusual. Enzymatic membrane reactors can be a promising technology to achieve such objectives. Orange II decolor-ized in a continuous stirred-tank reactor using MnP of Bjerkandera  sp. in a 
polyethersulfone membrane (Lopez et al., 2002). The preliminary experi-ment employed the addition of fresh MnP in pulses in fed-batch operation to maintain the highest degree of decolorization. Continuous decolorization was performed by continuous addition of MnP, H
2O2, and dye. The system decol-
orized 95% at a high dye loading rate of 2400 g/m3 per day for 20 minutes and 
reached a steady-state higher than 90% after 40 minutes.DECOLORIZATION AND DEGRADATION 461462 FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND DEGRADATION OF DYES
MnP of  P. chrysosporium  produced in ﬁ  xed-bed tubular bioreactors was 
shown to have the ability to decolorize structurally different dyes (Moldes et al., 2003). The bioreactor consisted of a glass column (0.25-L working volume) ﬁ lled with cubes of nylon sponge operated under semisolid conditions. During 
continuous addition of MnP and H
2O2 in a total volume of 20 ml, Poly R-478 
and Crystal Violet were decolorized 30% and 70%, respectively, after 2 hours. Photochemical treatment degraded 40% of Crystal Violet in 2 hours.
10.12.2 Laccase-Catalyzed Decolorization and Degradation of Dyes
In addition to LiP and MnP, laccase plays an important role in dye decolor-
ization. Fungal laccase-catalyzed decolorization and degradation of various types of dyes are noted in Table 10.9. Laccase from Pyricularia oryzae  oxi-
dized a number of phenolic azo dyes (Chivukula and Renganathan, 1995). Reduction of these azo linkages resulted in the formation of potentially car-cinogenic aromatic amines. VA acted as an inducer of laccase by Botryos-
phaeria  sp. when screened on the polymeric dye Poly R-478 (Barbosa et al., 
1996). Phlebia tremellosa  decolorized more than 96% (initial concentration 
200 mg/l) of textile azo dyes within 14 days under stationary incubation condi-tions (Kirby et al., 2000). Laccase activity was revealed in culture superna-tants in both the presence and absence of textile dye and correlated well with the period of dye decolorization. The supernatants of high laccase activity of Fomes sclerodermeus  decolorized Malachite Green in the presence or absence 
of 1 -hy dro xybenzotriazole ( 1 -HBT) (Papinutti and F orchiassin, 2004). This treatment produced a colorless substance named Decolorized Malachite Green (DMG), which is not toxic to P. chrysosporium  or any other white-rot 
fungi.
All strains of Pleurotus ostreatus  attain high laccase and MnP activities 
and decolorize Reactive Blue 158, Acid Blue 185, Acid Black 194, Orisol Blue BH, and Orisol Turquoise JL to various extents (Rodriguez et al., 1999). Trametes hispida  showed the highest laccase volumetric and decolorization 
activities on all ﬁ  ve dyes. Only the laccase activity correlated with the rate of 
decolorization in crude extracts. Two laccase isozymes puriﬁ  ed from T. 
hispida  can also decolorize these dyes. A mixture of two puriﬁ  ed laccases 
(POXC and POXA3) from Pleurotus ostreatus  improved the decolorization 
rate of Remazol Brilliant Blue B and reduced the dye toxicity by 95% (Palm-i e r i  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 5 ) .  P u r i ﬁ  ed laccase from Pycnosporus cinnabarinus  broke 
down the chromophore of Chicago Sky Blue in the presence of oxygen and produced two intermediate products (Schliephake et al., 2000). The transfor-mation rate of dye increased with increasing concentration of laccase. Laccase from Pycnosporus sanguineus  correlated with the dye decolorization, and 
less than 3% accounted for the sorption of dye to fungal mycelia (Pointing and Vrijmoed, 2000).
Differences in the decolorization efﬁ  ciency of four laccases (from 
three species of Trametes  and Sclerotium rolfsii ) has been attributed to the TABLE 10.9 Laccase-Catalyzed Decolorization and Degradation of Dyes

abstraction of four electrons from the substrate and proceeds analogously to 
the electrochemical oxidation of Indigo Carmine, which produces dehydro-indigo. Four electrons are necessary to reduce an O
2 molecule to water and 
to oxidize Indigo to isatin (indole-2,3-dione) as an intermediate. After the formation of isatin, further degradation occurred hydrolytically without the mediation of laccase. Isatin led to unstable isatic acid as an intermediate that decomposed spontaneously via decarboxylation to yield anthranilic acid (2-aminobenzoic acid) as the ﬁ  nal degradation product. Indigo degradation 
proceeded at a similarly timely rate for both laccases from  T. hirsuta  and 
occurred at a slower rate for the laccase of S. rolfsii . In addition, THL1 and 
S RL 1  l a c c a s e  t r e a t m e n t s  r e d u c e d  t h e  p a r t i c l e  s i z e  o f  i n d i g o  a g g l o m e r a t e s .  Incubating indigo-dyed fabrics with laccases from  T. hirsuta  and S. rolfsii
produced various bleaching effects, and this correlates with the release of indigo degradation products.
Several factors inﬂ  uence the rate of enzymatic degradation. These include 
adsorption phenomena, transport limitations and accessibility, and the redox potential of the laccase and the substrate. Steric effects may not inﬂ  uence 
oxidation rates if the binding sites of laccases for the reducing substrate appear to be shallow. For smaller substrates, such as Indigo, the electronic substituents on the aromatic ring are more important than the steric effects. A high redox potential, between 0.4 and 0.8 V, in the laccases will enhance the velocity of electron transfer from the substrate to the T1 site and the oxi-dation rate. Higher oxidation rates for T. hirsuta  laccases than for S. rolfsii
laccase do not suggest a higher redox potential of THL1 and THL2, as this situation may change using other substrates and reaction conditions (Campos et al., 2001). Electron-donating methyl and methoxy substituents appear to enhance laccase activity, while electron-withdrawing chloro, ﬂ  uoro, and nitro 
substituents inhibit oxidation of azophenols by fungal laccases.
10.12.2.1 Laccase Bioreactors.  Anthraquinone, azo, indigo, and triaryl-
methane dyes are degraded by laccase puriﬁ  ed from Trametes hirsuta  (Aba-
dulla et al., 2000b). Initial rates of decolorization depend on the substituents on the phenolic rings of the dyes. Immobilization of the T. hirsuta  laccase on 
alumina increases the thermal stability of enzymes and its tolerance against enzyme inhibitors such as halides, copper chelators, and dyeing additives. Up to 80% of the toxicity of anthaquinone dyes is reduced by immobilized laccase. Immobilized laccase from Coriolopsis gallica  UAMH 8260 retained 
85% of the initial activity after 10 cycles lasting 15 hours and 70% after 21 hours o v er 3 mon ths of in termi tten t use in decolorization of Reactiv e Blue 198 dye (Reyes et al., 1999). Free laccase decolorized 13 of 38 industrial dyes and 26 of 38 dyes in the presence of 1 mM HBT as a free radical mediator, enhancing both the range and degree of decolorization. Addition of activators such as ethanol and VA and aeration can increase the laccase levels in Tram-
etes versicolor  (Maceiras et al., 2001). T. versicolor  grown on nylon sponge 
functioning as a physical support for bound mycelium can decolorize the polymeric dye Poly R-478, and 90% decolorization occurs in VA-
supplemented cultures.
10.12.2.2 Inﬂ  uence of Mediators.  Several mediators are recognized to 
enhance the degradation of dyes by laccases. The mechanism of catalysis of laccase is different depending on the dye structure (Wong and Yu, 1999). The Michaelis–Menten kinetics of enzymes implies that the anthraquinone dye is a substrate for laccase. Azo and Indigo dyes are not good substrates, and their degradation requires the mediation of some small-molecule ( <8 kDa) metabo-
lites. About 20-fold degradation of azo dyes and Indigo Carmine occurs in the presence of 2,2 ′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS). 
Bleaching of fabrics by laccases in the presence of mediators has been corre-lated with the release of Indigo degradation products (Campos et al., 2001).
Various mediators show remarkable differences in their abilities to enhance 
dye decolorization by laccase from Trametes modesta  ( N y a n h o n g o  e t  a l . ,  
2002). Decolorization of Acid Blue 225, Acid Violet 17 , and Reactive Black 5 was enhanced two- to sixfold in the presence of HBT at 50ºC. Two media-tors, 2-methoxyphenothiazine (MPT) and 3 ′, 5′-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-aceto-
phenone (DMHAP), enhanced the decolorization of Basic Red 9 base. On the contrary, mediators such as DMHAP and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine (HTMP) inhibited the decolorization of some dyes.
A commercial formulation of pure fungal laccase produced from the sub-
merged fermentation of a genetically modiﬁ  ed Aspergillus  sp. has been 
employed for the decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) (Soares et al., 2001a). This formulation contains laccase, a mediator (phenothiazine-10-propionic acid), and a nonionic surfactant in phosphate buffer. The commercial laccase formulation (CLF) decolorized 30% of RBBR after 20 minutes. Violuric acid at 5.7 mM concentration with laccase was the most effective mediator. According to the Michaelis–Menten equation, the kinetic parameters of laccase-catalyzed reactions follow pseudo-ﬁ  rst-order kinetics. 
Comparison of fungal laccases in combination with a variety of mediators indicates that the redox potential of the laccases varies depending on the source of the laccase. A wild-type Coprinus cinereus  laccase and its recom-
binant form expressed in Aspergillus oryzae  has been puriﬁ  ed and character-
ized (Schneider et al., 1999). This laccase, mediated by several phenols and phenothiazines, can bleach Direct Blue 1 dye oxidatively at an alkaline pH.
10.13 DECOLORIZATION OF ARTIFICIAL TEXTILE EFFLUENT
During the last decade, some researchers prepared artiﬁ  cial textile dye efﬂ  u-
ents and used fungi for decolorization and degradation. Such studies are limited and are noted in Table 10.10. Eight individual dyes were decolorized extensively by P. chrysosporium  (93 to 100%), compared to 74 to 96% for C.

468consumption was reduced linearly but not depleted completely. The greatest 
color reduction occurred when maximum MnP levels were detected. Addition of aromatic compounds into the culture medium not only enhanced the activ-ity of MnP two- to fourfold but also changed the isozyme composition (Leon-tievsky et al., 1991). In an artiﬁ  cial efﬂ  uent containing eight reactive azo dyes, 
Trametes versicolor  showed nearly 90% decolorization after 7 days along with 
a biomass of 1.20 g/l (Martins et al., 2003). Immobilized Irpex lacteus
efﬁ ciently decolorized a textile efﬂ  uent containing different dye mixtures 
(Novotny et al., 2004). Drimarene Blue, Drimarene Red, Remazol Green, and Acid Black decolorized to 100%, 80%, 45%, and 35%, respectively, within 3 to 5 days. Phlebia tremellosa  removed 98% of the color of an artiﬁ  cial 
textile efﬂ  uent containing nine dyes after 14 days when ﬂ  ushed daily with 
oxygen (Kirby et al., 2000). In addition to laccase, another process appears to be responsible for color removal in the absence of detectable levels of this enzyme.
Aspergillus foetidus  decolorized a mixture of dyes simultaneously without 
preference (Sumathi and Manju, 2000). This implies the presence of a non-speciﬁ  c system vital for the treatment of textile efﬂ  uents. Geotrichum sp. 
CCMI 1019 transformed all three reactive dyes in 5 days when 20-day-old cultures were spiked with successive amounts (200 ppm) of dyes (Maximo et al., 2003). The fungus has the sustained ability to transform a large amount of dyes (800 ppm), suggesting potential applications in decolorization of the textile wastewater. In an artiﬁ  cial textile efﬂ  uent of ﬁ  ve dyes, nitrogen addi-
tion had certain effects: improved the enzyme activities and dye decoloriza-tion due to Phanerochaete chrysosporium ; increased the enzyme activities 
for Coriolopsis gallica  without improvement in decolorization; and had no 
major effect on dye degradation due to Bjerkandera adusta  but with a slight 
increase by Phlebia tremellosa  (Robinson et al., 2001b,c). The highest levels 
of LiP and laccase were produced in the presence of dyes in nitrogen-rich media, almost twice the levels of nitrogen-limited media. The LiP activity doubled and laccase activity quadrupled for P. tremellosa  in nitrogen-rich 
media. B. adusta  shows lower enzyme activities in nitrogen-rich media. 
MnP activities are low and it is difﬁ  cult to assess their role in dye 
decolorization.
Industrial efﬂ  uents contain a number of dyes, and some of them may be 
anthraquinone dyes, which are good substrates of laccase. Azo dye can be degraded by repeated additions of anthraquinone dyes (Wong and Yu, 1999). The slow degradation of nonsubstrate azo and indigo dyes by laccase increased at a low concentration of anthraquinone dye. Anthraquinone dye acted as a mediator instead of a catalyst, as it also decomposed gradually with the decomposition of other dyes. Immobilized laccase from Coriolopsis gallica
decolorized nearly 100% of an artiﬁ  cial textile efﬂ  uent containing Direct 
Blue 200, Direct Red 80, Direct Black 22, sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbon-ate, soap, and dispersant within 120 hours (Reyes et al., 1999). Immobilized laccase retained only 14% of initial activity after 10 cycles.DECOLORIZATION OF ARTIFICIAL TEXTILE EFFLUENT 469470 FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND DEGRADATION OF DYES
10.14 SEQUENTIAL DYE DECOLORIZATION
Little is known at present on sequential dye decolorization. Aqueous sequen-
tial decolorization occurred in batch cultures of white-rot fungi in a 20-day period (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999a). The addition of each dye was in the order Amaranth, Remazol Black, Remazol Orange, Tropaeolin O, Reactive Blue, Remazol Black, and Remazol Orange, and the dye was added only after previous complete dye decolorization. Trametes versicolor  maintained 
a high level of color removal on sequential additions of various dyes, includ-ing a mixture of Remazol Black, Remazol Orange, and Reactive Blue. The physiological differences among three cultures may account for the differ-ences in decolorizing enzymes and eventually, the decolorization ability. All three fungi are known to secrete LiP and MnP, but T. versicolor  also pro-
duces laccases.
Mycelial pellets of T. versicolor  decolorized successive additions of Ama-
ranth and of different dyes and dye mixtures containing glucose and ammo-nium tartrate (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999b). Constant rates of decolorization were sustained above 0.13 g/l of glucose. Decolorization followed ﬁ  rst-order 
kinetics for Amaranth concentration. It is possible that glucose is a substrate for the generation of H
2O2 required for extracellular peroxidase activity and/
or the generation of Mn(III)-complexing agents necessary for MnP activity. Rapid color removal was maintained at 0.086 g/l NH
4+. The culture conditions 
of repressing ligninolysis and dye decolorization by P. chrysosporium  indicate 
that dye decolorization by T. versicolor  may be a distinct process from that 
of P. chrysosporium .
10.15 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Color-free efﬂ  uent discharge to receiving waters is a main concern of the 
public at all times. Decolorization of the complicated dye molecules, salt concentrations, and a wide range of pH cause many complications. The limita-tions of physicochemical processes lead to a search for new methods of dye decolorization. This approach involves several aspects related to decoloriza-tion, degradation, and mineralization of dyes. This process is fungal, eco-nomical, unique, and innovative to industry and has public acceptance. Various bioreactors are clearly indicators of success in the use of fungi in textile and dyestuff-containing wastewaters. At present, computer models are unknown in fungal dye decolorization technology. However, models can predict the performance of bioreactors under various operating conditions and clearly add valuable data on the dynamics of the system. By optimizing the conditions and requirements, including the coproduction of relevant enzymes, H
2O2, and VA, a cost-effective and reliable conﬁ  gured bioreactor 
can be established, resulting in a high rate of decolorization and range of dye compounds.A considerable amount of work has been done dealing with the screening 
of fungal genera and species in the decolorization and degradation of dye-containing wastewaters. At present, most screening studies are based on the wood-rotting basidiomycete fungi. The ability of white-rot fungi to degrade dyes implies widespread decolorizing ability among fungi. We should employ a screening system to other classes of fungi to discover new, effective, dye-decolorizing fungal species superior to P. chrysosporium  that do not produce 
unwanted side products. Nearly 77% of 150 μg/g of Remazol Brilliant Blue R 
was removed from a soil environment by Irpex lacteus  after 7 days at 28ºC 
(Novotny et al., 2001). Thermophilic or thermotolerant fungi have not been exploited in dye decolorization systems. Furthermore, a search for fungal species that utilize dyes as a sole source of carbon may produce future appli-cations. Also, exploration of a new class of enzymes that degrade dyes should be continued to maximize the beneﬁ  t of these organisms.
Textile wastewater always contains a wide range and concentration of dyes. 
Successful decoloration of a single dye does not effectively suggest the suit-ability of a fungus in a decoloration treatment system. This implies the devel-opment of an appropriate biodecoloration system that can handle and sustain a high level of activity upon repeated exposure to dyes. Little is known of the fungal treatment of mixtures of dyes and sequential decolorization, but fungi have a great potential to degrade textile efﬂ  uents. Sequential decolorization 
demands a step-by-step examination of media and extracellular contents. In certain cases, industrial efﬂ  uents contain substrate dyes that can induce the 
degradation of nonsubstrate dyes. Certain compounds can also mediate the degradation of nonsubstrate dyes. More research is needed to establish the relationship between the molecular structure of dyes and fungal decolorization.
Variations in the composition of efﬂ  uents deﬁ  ne the need for a nonspeciﬁ  c 
process for treatment. Use of the nonspeciﬁ  c ligninolytic system by white-rot 
fungi to decolorize dyes of structurally different classes has been well dem-onstrated. Fungal enzymes such as LiP, MnP, and laccases can cleave aromatic rings and have the potential to break down dye molecules. Dye degradation relationship among mediators, nonsubstrate dyes, and laccase can open new horizons in the biodegradation of various dyes in industrial efﬂ  uents. There 
have been several instances where dyes were decolorized by unknown enzymes or mechanisms. An elucidation of the mechanisms and metabolic pathways will facilitate the development of novel types of bioreactors.
Molecular biology and biotechnology have not played an active role in the 
genetic manipulation of fungi for the biodegradation of dye-containing waste-water. Fungal genes have not been isolated that are speciﬁ  c for the biodegra-
dation of dye-containing wastewater. However, several genes encoding for different isozymes of LiP have been isolated and sequenced. A future exists for the development of genes cloning for the decolorization and degradation of dyes as well as bioengineered fungi that can utilize dyes as sole substrates.CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 471472 FUNGAL DECOLORIZATION AND DEGRADATION OF DYES

FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF 
HEA VY METALS
11.1 INTRODUCTION
The subtle and intricate process of removal of metals from aqueous solution 
has been known to the world for more than 5000 years, since Moses sweet-ened water using wood (Eccles, 1995). But microorganisms have been used to treat waste liquids since the end of the nineteenth century. However, the removal and/or recovery of metals from liquids or streams has received most attention during the past three decades.
Global industrialization is of great concern as a result of the release to the 
environment of toxic and persistent heavy metals that cause deleterious eco-logical effects and pose a serious threat to animals and humankind. The r e l e a s e s  a l s o  l e a d  t o  t h e  m o b i l i z a t i o n  o f  m e t a l s  t h r o u g h  l e a c h i n g .  S e v e r a l  industries—electroplating, electronic circuit production, steel and nonferrous processes, chemical and pharmaceutical, and others—discharge a variety of metal-laden wastewaters into the environment. Coal-ﬁ  red power plants also 
produce large quantities of metal releases at several points during combus-tion. Release of industrial wastewater due to acid mine drainage over a large area is another big problem. In the United States, 389 of 703 National Priority List sites contain toxic metal contaminants and at least 100 000 such sites are estimated in the European Union (Schmitt and Stitcher, 1991; Wilmoth et al., 1991). Government agencies have developed metal discharge standards in a n u m b e r  o f  c o u n t r i e s  t o  r e g u l a t e  s u c h  r e l e a s e s  a n d  c o n t a m i n a n t s  i n  w a s t e -waters entering waterways and sewerage systems.

This phenomenon is known as biosorption , and the microorganisms respon-
sible for the process are considered biosorbents . A wide variety of living and 
dead biomass of bacteria, algae, fungi, and plants is capable of sequestering toxic metals from waste streams. This is the foundation of biosorption tech-
nology , which offers a promising and economical alternative for the treatment 
of discharges of a wide variety of metal-containing industrial efﬂ  uents. A 
plethora of literature exists on the biosorption of metal ions by bacteria, algae, fungi, and plants. Conservative estimates of new biosorbents in the North America environmental market amount to $27 million per year (Volesky, 2001). Yeasts and fungi are unique in metal biosorption, and this process is known as mycosorption . The fungal biomass used in mycosorption is termed 
mycosorbent . Mycosorption is a topic of great interest for researchers all over 
the world (Paknikar et al., 1998; Tobin, 2001; Malik, 2004).
11.2 BIOSORPTION AND BIOACCUMULATION OF 
HEA VY METALS
The process of biosorption and bioaccumulation of metals by microorganisms 
is not new. The accumulation of metals by fungi has received more attention in recent years because of its applications in environmental protection and recovery of metals. The biological removal of metals from solutions can be divided into three categories: (1) biosorption of metal ions on the surface of fungi, (2) intracellular uptake of metal ions, and (3) chemical transformation of metal ions by fungi. Living fungal biomass is required in the last two cate-gories. Nonliving fungal biomass does not depend on requirements for growth, metabolic energy, and transport. In addition, nonliving biomass shows a strong afﬁ  nity for metal ions due to the lack of protons produced during 
metabolism. The problem of toxicity of metals does not affect this type of biomass, which is seen as one of the major advantages of biosorption. Fungal biomass can be generated as a waste by-product of large-scale industrial fer-mentation and is pretreated by washing with acids and/or bases before ﬁ  nal 
drying and granulation. All these factors contribute to reducing the ﬁ  nal cost 
of the process.
Biosorption is a pseudo-ion-exchange process in which metal ion is 
exchanged for a counterion in the biomass or resin. In general, the ﬁ  lamentous 
fungi possess higher adsorption capacities for heavy metal removal. Aquatic fungi are also known to accumulate heavy metals. Uptake of metals was described by Michelot et al. (1998) and a tentative approach related to mecha-nisms of bioaccumulation in mushrooms was projected. The marine fungi Corollospora lacera  and Monodictys pelagica  have been found to accumulate 
lead and cadmium extracellularly in mycelia (Taboski et al., 2005). Biosorp-tion involves a number of external factors (e.g., type of metal, ionic form in solution, and the functional site) and tends to be exothermic. Other factors, BIOSORPTION AND BIOACCUMULATION OF HEAVY METALS 485486 FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF HEAVY  METALS
such as pH, temperature, biomass concentration, type of biomass preparation, 
initial metal ion concentration and metal characteristics, and concentration of other interfering ions, are also important in evaluating the extent of bio-sorption. Biosorption and recovery can be intensiﬁ  ed in the presence of stir-
ring induced by magnetic ﬁ  eld (Gorobets et al., 2004).
11.3 EV ALUATION OF SORPTION PERFORMANCE
A great deal of confusion exists as to the evaluation of experimental data, 
despite the simple process of biosorption. This is due to the various method-ologies and criteria used in the process. Another problem is evaluation of sorption performance when more than one metal is present in a system. At present, all theories and models are focused on single-metal systems. Due to limi t e d  kn o w l e d g e  o n  m ul tim e t al  s y s t e m s ,  i t  i s  difﬁ  cult to reach predictive 
conclusions.
A plethora of literature exists on the evaluation of sorption performance. 
Adsorption is a well-known equilibrium separation process, and equilibrium data, known as adsorption isotherms , are basic requirements for design of the 
systems. The Langmuir and Freundlich equations are commonly employed in evaluating the adsorption isotherms at constant temperature. The Lang-muir model is applicable to monolayer sorption onto a surface with a ﬁ  nite 
number of identical sites. The well-known Langmuir model  is given by:
qqbC
bCf
f=+max1
where q ( m g / g )  i s  t h e  u p t a k e  o f  t h e  m e t a l ,  qmax is the maximum uptake, 
Cf (mg/g) is the equilibrium (ﬁ  nal) concentration of metal in the solution, and 
b is a constant.
The empirical Freundlich model based on sorption on a heterogeneous 
surface is given by:
qK C fn=1/
where K and n, the Freundlich constants, are indicators of adsorption capacity 
and adsorption intensity, respectively. The equation can be linearized in loga-rithmic form and the Freundlich constants can be determined.
Other biosorption isotherms are also known from the literature. These 
isotherms may not represent the physicochemical principles of the biosorption process and are not well understood. The models can determine the qversus 
C
f relationship as experimentally observed but do not provide any clues to 
the biosorption mechanism. The equilibrium models include the Scatchard–Langmuir, Redlich–Peterson, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Radke–Prausnitz, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR). Some of these can be determined by the following equations:Scatchard–Langmuir:
q
Cbq bq
f=− max
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller:
qBQC
CC B C Cf
sf s=−+ − () ( ) [] () / 11
where Cs is the saturation constant of the solute, B is a constant related to 
energy of interaction with the surface, and Q is the moles of solute adsorbed 
per unit weight of adsorbent in forming a complete monolayer on the surface.
Dubinin–Radushkevich:
In Inqq m B E=−
2
where B is a constant related to the sorption energy and E is the Polanyi 
potential: E=RT ln(1 + 1/Cf).
These biosorption isotherms do not always provide a meaningful interpre-
tation of data and are not applicable for systems operating under variable environmental conditions. This process generates irregular biosorption iso-therms, due to variations related to multiple sites, the nature of the sorbent material, pH, and the complex chemistry of metal ions. Rapid uptake of metal by a fungal biosorbent is desirable. Two different sorption systems must be compared at the same equilibrium concentrations to obtain accurate results. The presence of other ions or co-cations also inﬂ  uences the sorption system 
by unnecessary interactions with the metal species.
11.4 MECHANISMS OF FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF 
HEA VY METALS
Biosorption consists of several mechanisms that differ according to the fungal 
species used, the origin of the biomass, and its processing. These mechanisms include ion exchange, chelation, adsorption, crystallization, and precipitation, followed by ion entrapment in inter- and intraﬁ  brillar capillaries, spaces of 
the polysaccharide material, and diffusion through the cell wall and mem-branes of fungi. Cell walls of fungi are composed of chitins, chitosans, and glucans and also contain proteins, lipids, and other polysaccharides. Yeast cell walls consist mainly of glucans and an outer layer of mannoprotein. Pre-cipitation can occur in the cell wall components. The biomass usually con-tains a larger number and variety of functional groups or sites than those in monofunctional group ion-exchange resins. These sites include carboxyl, MECHANISMS OF FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF HEAVY METALS 487488 FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF HEAVY  METALS
sulfate, phosphate, hydroxyl, amino, imino, sulfonate, imidazole, sulfydryl, 
carbonyl, thioether, and other moieties. Certain fungal species are more effective and selective than others in removing particular metal ions from solution.
The mechanisms of fungal biosorption can be divided into two categories: 
metabolism independent and metabolism dependent. The ﬁ  rst category 
employs live or dead biomass, and the second category transforms the metal internally coupled with the production of extracellular metabolites. The mechanisms of fungal biosorption are a topic of great interest to many authors; however, signiﬁ  cant differences are recognized in the biosorbent 
mechanisms of fungal biomass. Electron microscopy, x-ray energy diffraction analysis, and infrared (IR) spectroscopy are also used to study binding mech-anisms. The amino group of the cell walls of Rhizopus nigricans  is involved 
in Cr(VI) binding from solution and from wastewater (Bai and Abraham, 2002). Chemical modiﬁ  cation increases the number of active binding sites 
on the surface area that enhances the chromium adsorption capacity. The amine functional groups of Mucor  cell walls also contributes to the removal 
of chromium from tanning efﬂ  uent (Tobin and Roux, 1998). Fourier trans-
form infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis reveals the involvement of —COOH groups of acetone-washed yeast biomass in lead biosorption (Ashkenazy et al., 1997). The —COOH groups also contribute to the binding sites of metals in the cell walls of Mucor rouxii  (Gardea-Torresdey et al., 
1996). Electron microscopy, x-ray energy diffraction analysis, and IR spec-troscopy reveal three hypotheses of the mechanism of lead uptake (Zhang et al., 1998). NaOH-treated and NaOH-untreated biomass establish that bio-sorption occurs in the chitin structure of cell walls. Electron microscopy reveals the localization of nickel on the cell surface of Rhizopus  sp. 0101 
( M o g o l l o n  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 8 ) .  T r a n s m i s s i o n  e l e c t r o n  m i c r o s c o p y  ( T E M )  s h o w s  that Pb(II) is associated in the cell wall and membrane after 3 minutes and cytoplasm after 2 hours in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ( S u h  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 8 ).  A  
three-step mechanism of Pb(II) accumulation is advocated. The ﬁ  rst step is 
metabolism independent, the second step is metabolism dependent, and the third step is metabolism dependent or independent after 24 hours. Two mech-anisms govern the removal of Cr(VI) from the aqueous solution by dead biomass of Aspergillus niger  (Park et al., 2005). During mechanism I, Cr(VI) 
is reduced directly to Cr(III) by contact with the biomass. Mechanism II consists of three steps: the binding of Cr(VI) to positively charged groups in the cell wall, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by adjacent functional groups, and release of Cr(III) by electron repulsion.
Fungi can remove both soluble and insoluble metals from solution and can 
leach metals from solid wastes. Fungi produce protons, organic acids, phos-phatases, and other metabolites for solubilization. Many heterotrophic fungi produce organic acids that assist in solubility and complexing of metal cations. Several fungi are known to produce large amounts of different kinds of acids that assist in metal leaching purposes. Oxalic acid is a leaching agent for a variety of metals, such as Al, Fe, and Li, forming soluble metal oxalate 
complexes. Metal oxalates are also produced by a wide range of fungi, includ-ing mycorrhizas and lichenicolous fungi. The white-rot fungi Bjerkandera 
fumosa ,Phlebia radiata , and Trametes versicolor  and the brown-rot fungus 
Fomitopsis pinicola  produce oxalate crystals in high levels on ZnO, Co
3(PO 4)2,
and CaCO 3 (Jarosz-Wilkolazka and Gadd, 2003). In brown-rot fungi, induc-
tion of oxalic acid is related to copper tolerance (Green and Clausen, 2003). Brown-rot fungi can maintain oxalic acid concentrations as high as 600 μM/g. 
O x ali c  a ci d  i s  al s o  p r o d u ce d  b y  b r o wn - r o t  fun gi  d urin g  l e a c hin g  o f  m e t al s  from the treated wood (Humar et al., 2004). One-third of the isolates of soil fungi are able to solubilize at least one toxic metal compound, ZnO, Co
3(PO 4)2,
and Zn 3(PO 4)2, and 10% solubilize all three (Sayer et al., 1995). In Penicil-
lium simplicissimum , adsorption of zinc is accompanied by the production of 
citric acid (Franz et al., 1991 ). The cultural ﬁ  ltrate of Aspergillus niger  can 
render the solubility of 18% Cu, 7% Ni, and 4% Co, and these amounts are enhanced by the addition of HCl (Sukla et al., 1992). Fe(III) can be solubi-lized by a low-molecular-weight chelating compound known as the ferri-chrome (Crichton, 1991). The structure of the hyphae in the form of hard compact pellets is altered due to a manganese deﬁ  c i e n c y  ( S c h r e f e r l  e t  a l . ,  
1986). Penicillium janthinellum  F-13 on different media reduces Al toxicity, 
but tolerance of the high external concentration of Al appears to be due to a different mechanism (Zhang et al., 2002).
The mechanisms of fungal transformation are reduction, methylation, and 
dealkyla tion of metals (T able 1 1 . 1 ). Certain species of Penicillium  are also 
known to remove iron from alloys (Siegel et al., 1990). Alternaria alternata
causes volatilization of substantial amounts of selenium to the dimethylsele-nide form (Thompson-Eagle et al., 1991). The volatilization process is opti-mized and used in the fungal bioremediation of contaminated water and land (Thompson-Eagle and Frankenberger, 1992). The mechanism of fungal selenium transformations has been described (Thompson-Eagle and Frankenberger, 1992; Gadd, 1993). Several fungal species (i.e., Candida 
humicola ,Gliocladium roseum , and Penicillium  sp.) have been established 
to methylate arsenic compounds such as arsenate [As(V), AsO
43−], arsenite 
[As(III), AsO 2−], and methylarsonic acid [CH 3H2AsO 3] to volatile dimethyl-
[(CH 3)2HAs] or trimethylarsine [(CH 3)3As] (Tamaki and Frankenberger, 
1992). Fusarium oxysporum  reduces silver ions in solution, thus forming 
stable silver hydrosol (Ahmad et al., 2003). Siver nanoparticles of 5 to 15 nm are stabilized by proteins of the fungus. It seems that the reduction of silver ions occurs due to an enzymatic process. A FeCl
3-pretreated waste tea fungal 
mat is an effective biosorbent for As(III) and As(V), and an autoclaved fungal mat is effective for Fe(II) removal from a groundwater sample (Murugesan et al., 2006). Modiﬁ  cation of mobility and toxicity of metalloids 
by these processes can lead to their biotechnological potential in bioremedia-tion. For more discussion of the mechanisms of mycotransformation of metals, the reader is referred to a review by Gadd (2001).MECHANISMS OF FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF HEAVY METALS 489TABLE 11.1 Fungal Transformation of Metals, Metalloids, and Organometals

49011.5 FUNGAL BIOSORPTION REACTORS FOR HEAVY METALS
11.5.1 Types of Reactors
In recent years, fungal biosorption reactors have been well developed (Table 
11.2) but not commercialized. The process of biosorption is basically a solid–liquid contact and requires reﬁ  nement in the light of variable conditions. 
Based on appropriate contact between the metal solution and biosorbent, several types of biosorption reactors have been recognized: batch stirred-tank, continuous-ﬂ  ow stirred-tank, ﬁ  xed packed-bed, pulsating-bed, 
ﬂ uidized-bed, multiple-bed, and others.
11.5.1.1 Batch Stirred-Tank Reactors.  Batch reactors were one of the 
earliest used for the effectiveness of metal–biosorbent systems. A plug-ﬂ  ow 
biosorption reactor with a limited retention time for the removal of copper is depicted in Figure 11.1 (Butter et al., 1998). The metal-containing inﬂ  uent 
and biomass suspension are pumped to an in-line mixer. The mixed solution ﬂ ows in a pipe sufﬁ  cient for a retention time of 2 to 5 minutes. Polyelectrolyte 
solution is added from the second in-line mixer, resulting in ﬂ  occulation of 
biomass, and this solution is then discharged into the settling tank. This process is operated continuously at a ﬂ  ow rate of 1.5 l/m with a 87% reduction 
in copper. Batch stirred-tank reactors in series are also known for their adsorption of Cu(II) and Ni(II) by Rhizopus arrhizus  (Sag and Kutsal, 
1995).
11.5.1.2 Continuous-Flow Stirred-Tank Reactors.  In a continuous-ﬂ  ow 
stirred-tank reactor (CFST), the chamber or vessel is similar to that used for batch systems; however, there is a continuous supply of the metal solution. Based on the operations, two basic types are known: (1) a type using a con-tinuous feed of fresh biosorbent, which is then harvested continuously from the bioreactor in the efﬂ  uent, and (2) a type that retains a batch of the bio-
sorbent in the system by option in the reactor. At present, little is known about the biosorption of metals involving the CFST. However, heavy metals have been removed in a CFST using Rhizopus arrhizus  (Sag et al., 2000b).
11.5.1.3 Fixed Packed-Bed Reactors. Pycnosporus sanguineus  has the 
ability to adsorb heavy metals from aqueous solution using the ﬁ  xed-bed 
column shown in Figure 11.2 (Zulfadhly et al., 2001). The biosorption process utilizes a Perspex column of 5 cm internal diameter, 0.2 cm wall thickness, and 1 m length. In general, the P. sanguineus  biomass removes more than 90% of 
Pb(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II). The lead uptake increases with an increase in bed height from 4 cm to 15 cm. The efﬁ  ciency of the process remains the same for 
the ﬁ  rst two cycles, then drops a little in the third and fourth cycles.
11.5.1.4 Immobilized Reactors.  Immobilized cell systems are known to 
be exploited in commercially oriented biosorption research. The advantages FUNGAL BIOSORPTION REACTORS FOR HEAVY METALS 491TABLE 11.2 Fungal Bioreactors for Biosorption of Heavy Metals

and in phase separation after metal uptake. Dead fungal biomass can be immobilized in polyacrylamide, alginate, polysulfone, textile ﬁ  bers, and inor-
ganic compounds for the removal of metals. Biomass can be immobilized by three techniques: entrapment, encapsulation, and bonding. Many ﬁ  lamentous 
fungi tend to form pellets in submerged cultures. So it is necessary to examine the physiological characteristics of the mycelium and the physicochemical factors in relation to pellet formation. Immobilized fungal cells increase the FUNGAL BIOSORPTION REACTORS FOR HEAVY METALS 495

size of the individual biosorbent particles. Increased removal efﬁ  ciencies 
and reduced pressure drops coupled with low capital and low operation and space costs make this process attractive. Also, high ﬂ  ow rates can be handled 
in immobilized reactors with less chance of clogging. Immobilized biomass can be used in stirred-tank and packed-bed systems. Variants of packed-bed systems include stirred-tank and airlift ﬁ  xed-bed or ﬂ  uidized-bed 
bioreactors.
Biomass–polysulfone beads for immobilizing Aspergillus niger  display 
good handling and settling qualities and the biomass loss is negligible during the process (Kapoor and Viraraghavan, 1998b). A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix for inactivated Saccharomyces cerevisiae  for copper biosorption 
displays a low mass-transfer resistance (Ting and Sun, 2000). Immo-bilization of nonviable S. cerevisiae  in PVA Na–alginate and alkali-treated 
polyethylenimine:glutaraldehyde (PEI:GA) shows the highest Cu(II)-accumulating capacity (80%), which can be increased by regeneration and reuse of the pellets (Stoll and Duncan, 1997). The Thomas model has been found suitable for the column kinetics of metal removal using immobilized Mucor rouxii  biomass in polysulfone matrix (Yan and Viraraghavan, 2001). 
The biosorption of metals on the carboxymethyl cellulose and both immobi-lized live and heat-killed Trametes versicolor  preparations increases with an 
increase in initial concentration of these ions (Yalcinkaya et al., 2002; Bayra-moglu et al., 2003). An immobilized biomass of Fomitopsis carnea  on PVA 
beads showed 80% gold removal as compared to that on immobilized calcium–alginate beads (Khoo and Ting, 2001). Dead fungal biomass immobilized in polyacrylonitrile-B/75% removed metals from simulated wastewaters (Zouboulis et al., 2003). The bioreactor shown in Figure 11.3 was developed for the detoxiﬁ  cation of Cr(VI) in contaminated soils (Krishna and Philip, 
2005). More than 80% Cr(VI) reduction has been obtained at an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 50 mg/l within 4 hours. The adsorption column of powdered Ganoderma lucidum  was used as a polishing treatment unit, and 
this removed more than 95% of Cr(III) within 3 hours. This biosystem is a feasible option for the ex situ treatment of Cr(VI)-contaminated soils.
11.5.2 Models of Process Development
Mathematical models and computer simulations are important tools in the 
development of technologies from the laboratory to full-scale application at various levels. Models also assist in analyzing the experimental data and process designs, and their optimization is necessary in evaluating the response of systems under variable operating conditions. Computer simulations are generally a new area and can contribute to the realistic predictions of the process. For further information on the equilibrium and kinetic models, including the applications of fungal biosorption, the reader is referred to a recent review (Aksu, 2005). The different biosorption models and their appli-cability related to fungal systems are integrated in Table 11.3.TABLE 11.3 Models for Development of Fungal Biosorption

11.5.3 Desorption and Regeneration
The objective of desorption is to regenerate the biomass for the next step 
in biosorption and recovery of biosorbed metal. Selection of the desorbent and the desorption process are important so that these can easily integrate into the entire process of fungal biosorption. The regeneration of the bio-sorbent reduces the cost of the biosorption process and opens the door for the recovery of metal from the liquid phase. Several articles have been pub-lished on varying treatments with little or no loss in biosorptive capacity. Metal elution, elution potential and efﬁ  ciencies, and recovery from the 
biomass have been discussed (Singleton and Tobin, 1996). Common as well as effective metal eluants used for the regeneration of fungal biomass are listed in Table 11.4.
Sodium bicarbonate proves a good eluter for some fungi belonging to 
Mucorales (Galun et al., 1983). Treatment of Rhizopus nigricans  biomass 
with 0.1 N NaOH and formaldehyde resulted in deterioration of the adsorp-tion capacity (Bai and Abraham, 2002). Extraction with alcohol, acetone, and HCl improved the uptake capacity. Boiling of Saccharomyces uvarum  biomass 
enhanced the adsorption of Pb (Ashkenazy et al., 1997). More than 90% of the biosorbed metal, equivalent to a 25-fold increase in copper concentration, was eluted (Butter et al., 1998). Copper was recovered from the eluant by electrolysis using a rotating cathode cell. Treating Saccharomyces cerevisiae
with glucose increases the energy supply to yeast cells to accumulate more metals from solution (Mapolelo and T orto, 2004).

In general, efﬂ  uents contain more than one metal species. In biosorption 
experiments, a great competition exists for a limited number of binding sites for several metal species. In column experiments, afﬁ  nities and concentra-
tion of metals play an important role in the success of the efﬁ  ciency of the 
biosorption. Due to competition, some metals in trace or smaller amounts may reach a breakthrough curve before others in the column. The role of afﬁ nity of various metals and the criteria to reach breakthrough related to 
a speciﬁ  c metal in multimetal solutions or efﬂ  uents has not yet been 
explained.
11.6 APPLICATIONS OF FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF 
HEA VY METALS
11.6.1 Biosorption by Filamentous Fungi
Different types of biomass have been tested for their metal-binding capacities 
under certain conditions. Selection of biomass depends on the sequestering ability of the metal ions. Some types of sorbent has a broad range with no speciﬁ  city; others are speciﬁ  c for certain metals. Fungal biosorbents have 
been described by several researchers. The characteristics of the fungal biomass for suitability in the process are (1) biosorption efﬁ  ciency and metal 
uptake capacity and afﬁ  nity for metal ions, (2) speciﬁ  city for metal ions, (3) 
ﬂ occulation and sedimentation efﬁ  ciency, (4) desorption efﬁ  ciency, and (5) 
preservation of the biosorptive capacity. Fungal melanins of ﬁ  lamentous fungi 
also contribute to the removal of metals, and their interactions with metals have been explained by Fogarty and Tobin (1996).
The ﬁ  rst step in biosorption is the choice of metals. Uranium is given the 
highest consideration, due to great interest by the nuclear industry. Mercury, lead, and cadmium are next, due to strong toxic environmental effects. Chro-mium is highly toxic and must be reduced to a trivalent state that is more amenable to removal. Copper is used in many applications and is also increas-ing in the environment. Little is known as to the removal of radium, thorium, strontium, and neodymium by ﬁ  lamentous fungi. Table 11.5 lists the uptake 
of heavy metals by ﬁ  lamentous fungi. Fungi belonging to the Order Mucorales 
are good biosorbents of uranium (Volesky, 1994). Metal enrichment selectiv-ity by Mucor hiemalis  is in the decreasing order Cr(III) > Cu(II) > Pb(II) >
Ag(I) > Al(III) > Co(II) > Zn(II) > Ni(II) > Fe(II) > Mo(V) > Cd(II) > Cs(I) 
> Cr
2O72−> CrO 42−> VO3− (Pillichshammer et al., 1995). The dead biomass 
of Rhizopus nigricans  has been shown to be a potent biosorbent of Cr(VI) 
ions (Bai and Abraham, 2002). Rhizopus  sp. 0101 biosorbed 80% of Ni(II) 
within 2 hours at an initial concentration of 10 ppm (Mogollon et al., 1998). Aspergillus niger  removed 0.52 mg Cu(II)/g dry weight and A. pendulus

502revealed the presence of a strongly electron-dense layer of Th(IV) and U(VI) 
ions around the surface of cell walls of Aspergillus ﬂ  avus  after 2 hours (Hafez 
et al., 1997). Scanning electron microscopy coupled with x-ray energy disper-sion analysis indicated that K(I) and Ca(II) are replaced by Pb(II) on the cell wall of Mucor rouxii  (Lo et al., 1999). Chitin and chitosan of the cell wall are 
the predominant targets for zinc biosorption by Rhizopus arrhizus  (Zhou, 
1999). Lead uptake by nonliving R. nigricans  was reduced in the presence of 
c o-c a t i o n s  s u c h  a s  Z n( II )  an d  F e( III )  i o n s  a t  p H  4 . 0  ( Z h an g  e t  al . ,  1 99 8 ).  Trichoderma viride  was shown to survive the high metal concentration of 
Cu(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) as a result of resistant cells (Errasquin and Vazquez, 2003). This high tolerance appears to be due to its isolation from sludge containing high levels of metals.
Uptake of zinc by fungi has been summarized by Ross (1994). Zn(II) 
uptake by the yeast–mycelium dimorphic fungus Aureobasidium pullulans
grown in chemostat culture correlated with the saturation kinetics (Krogh et al., 1998). Zinc uptake affected the yeast–mycelium transition of Candida 
albicans  (Sabie and Gadd, 1990). Strain 1 of Cladosporium cladosporioides
sorbed gold and silver, and strain 2 sorbed copper and cadmium in addition to gold and silver (Pethkar et al., 2001). Strain 2 had 150 times the cell wall hexosamine content of strain 1. Hexosamine was responsible for non-speciﬁ  c metal binding; other cell wall polymers played a role in precious-
metal binding. Phoma sp. selectively accumulated silver (Pighi et al., 1989). 
Metal ions in both the distilled water and urban wastewater were adsorbed in the order Pb(II) > Cu(II) > Zn(II) > Cd(II) > Ni(II) using biomaterials 
obtained by thermal alkali treatment of Phomopsis  sp. (Saiano et al., 
2005).
The ability of ﬁ  lamentous fungi to adsorb radionuclides from the solution 
is well recognized. Among different fungi, the mutant varieties ( CSM-I  and 
CSM-II ) of Neurospora crassa  have the highest 
60Co and Fe(II) pickup 
capacities under stationary conditions (Rashmi et al., 2004). However, CSM-1  and CSM-II  showed a 75% and 50% decrease in 
60Co pickup capaci-
ties under shaking conditions. Penicillium citrinum  exhibited twice the 
increase in 60Co pickup capacity under shaking conditions. Rhizopus arrhizus
sequestered more than 99% of the total 241Am from a solution of 5.6 to 
111 MBq/l (44–877 μg/l) with adsorption capacities of 4 to 79 MBq/g biomass 
(dry weight) (33 to 627 μg/g) (Liu et al., 2002). Gray et al. (1996) estimated 
a ﬁ vefold higher ﬂ  ux of 137Cs through rhizomorphs of Armillaria gallica  than 
through undifferentiated hyphae. Accumulation of 137Cs occurred at the sites 
of initiation of basidiocarp primordia in Schizophyllum commune  when blue 
light induced fructiﬁ  cation (Gray et al., 1995). High concentrations of 137Cs 
and lower concentrations of 210Pb and 226Ra have been detected in mush-
rooms (Kirchner and Daillant, 1998). Models have been developed to esti-mate the 
210Pb deposited onto the fructiﬁ  cations to the 210Pb concentrations 
measured.APPLICATIONS OF FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF HEAVY METALS 503504 FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF HEAVY  METALS
11.6.2 Biosorption by White-Rot Fungi
The success of white-rot fungi in pulp bleaching efﬂ  uents has extended their 
role in heavy metal biosorption. White-rot fungi have the ability to sequester toxic levels of metal ions during growth in soil. The concentrations of heavy metal ions in soil and contaminated sites are generally higher than those in wood. These metals affect growth, reproduction, metabolic activity, mycelial morphology, enzymatic activities, and so on (Baldrian, 2003). On the con-trary, fungi trigger defense mechanisms to deter ill effects of metals on metabolism.
In general, heavy metals cause a reduction in growth, followed by changes 
in morphology in all groups of fungi. Cadmium adsorption to Schizophyllum 
commune  leads to the formation of aerial hyphae and loops and the develop-
ment of connective ﬁ  laments (Lilly et al., 1992). Certain fungi change their 
color in the presence of heavy metals. Stereum hirsutum  produced a yellow-
orange pigment in mycelium and extracellularly in the presence of 0.25 mM or more Cd(II) (Baldrian et al., 1996). A brown pigment was produced as  a  r e s ul t  o f  gr o wth  o f  Trametes versicolor  on medium containing Cd(II) 
(Baldrian and Gabriel, 1997). Schizophyllum commune  formed black myce-
lial pellets in Pb-containing media (Gabriel et al., 1994).
In general, heavy metals inhibit enzymatic reactions at several levels. 
Metals cause oxidative damage to proteins by binding to amino acid residues in enzymes. In white-rot fungi, the extracellular enzymes are affected at the transcriptional and translational levels. Low levels of essential metals are necessary for the production of ligninolytic enzymes. Manganese plays an important role in the expression of manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase and in the degradation of lignin. Copper is a cofactor for enzyme laccase. Addition of copper has a positive effect on the production of laccase in Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  (Karahanian et al., 1998), Trametes versicolor
(Collins and Dobson, 1997), Pleurotus ostreatus  (Palmieri et al., 2000b), 
Pleurotus sajor-caju  (Soden and Dobson, 2001), Trametes trogii  (Levin et al., 
2002), Trametes pubescens ,T. multicolor ,T. hirsuta ,T. gibbosa ,Ganoderma 
applanatum ,Polyporus ciliatus , and Panus tigrinus  (Galhaup and Haltrich, 
2 0 0 1 ) .  C o p p e r  a l s o  e n h a n c e s  t h e  p r o d u c t i o n  o f  a l l  i s o z y m e s  o f  l a c c a s e  i n  P. ostreatus  (Collins and Dobson, 1997). Metal-response elements (MRE) 
have also been identiﬁ  ed in laccase genes in P. ostreatus  which interact with 
the Cu-responsive transcriptional factors. Copper and cadmium increase laccase activity in P. ostreatus  (Baldrian and Gabriel, 2002). Heavy metals 
also have an inhibitory effect on these enzymes. In general, cellulases and hemicellulases are also inhibited by the presence of heavy metals. Metals also have an inhibitory effect on intracellular enzymes.
Metal ions accumulated in Daedalea quercina  decrease in the preferential 
order Zn > Cu > Pb > Al (Gabriel et al., 1996a). Ganoderma lucidum  follows 
a decrease in the toxicity of metals in the order Hg > Cd > Cu > U > Pb >
Mn = Z n  ( T h a m  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 9 ) .  N o n m e t a b o l i c  c o n c e n t r a t i o n  o f  P b ( I I )  b y  fungal cells correlates with a two-step Cd(II) uptake (Norris and Kelly, 
1997). The high sorptive capacity of resting cells implies surface biosorption and bioaccumulation and is catalyzed by enzymes responsible for binding, transporting, and depositing the metal into the vacuoles (Yetis et al., 2000). Trametes versicolor  is a good cadmium biosorbent, as it removes all Cd(II) 
ions within 2 hours (J arosz- Wilk olazka et al., 2002). This appears to be an energy-independent surface binding process that occurs at a rate of about 2 mg Cd(II) per gram of mycelial dry weight. Extracellular laccase activity was stimulated signiﬁ  cantly when Cd(II) ions were added to 10-day-old cul-
tures. Pleurotus ostreatus  accumulated 20% of Cd(II) intracellularly in the 
presence of 150 ppm of Cd(II) in the medium (Favero et al., 1991). Some isolates of Wolﬁ  poria cocos  have the capacity to degrade pine wood treated 
with high concentrations of copper chromated arsenate (CCA) wood preser-vatives, and others are not able to grow even at lower concentrations (De Groot and Woodward, 1999; Woodward and De Groot, 1999). Eleven of 12 isolates of the dry-rot fungus Serpula lacrymans  have shown tolerance to 
the copper-based wood preservative copper citrate (Hastrup et al., 2005). A substantial amount of work on white-rot fungi during the past decade indi-cates that these are good candidates for the biosorption of heavy metals (Table 11.6).
11.6.3 Biosorption by Yeasts
The order of metal afﬁ  nity is U > Zn > Cd > Cu for living and nonliv-
ing brewer’s yeast, Zn > (Cd) > U > Cu for nonliving baker’s yeast, and 
Zn > Cu ∼ (Cd) > U for living baker’s yeast (Volesky and May-Phillips, 1995). 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  exhibits ﬁ  ne needlelike crystals on both the outside 
and inside of the cells due to U uptake. Uptake of different oxidation states of selenium [Se(IV) and Se(VI)] and antimony [Sb(III) and Sb(V)] by bak-ers’s yeast demonstrates that not only the metal, but also its oxidation state, are important for biosorption (Perez-Corona et al., 1997).
The uptake of chromium by yeasts can be due to biosorption and 
active accumulation. A yeast mechanism for chromium stress may involve oxidation–reduction reactions, interaction with cellular organelle, binding by cytosolic molecules, formation of protein–DNA and Cr–DNA adducts and the formation of breaks in DNA strands and DNA–DNA cross-links. Differ-ent adsorption capacities for Cr(VI) are noted with different species of yeasts, and Candida utilis  exhibits the highest activity (Rapoport and Muter, 1995). 
C. utilis  showed a metal uptake of 7 for Cr(VI), 23 for Cu(II), 39 for Pb(II), 
19 for Cd(II), and 28 mg for Zn per gram dry weight, respectively (Muter et al., 2002). The area of all sorbed individual metals did not cover all the surface of a single cell, except for Zn(II), which covers up to 168%. Living S. cerevisiae  (Batic and Raspor, 1998) accumulated 30 mg/g dry weight of 
Cr(III) in the cell and Candida intermedia  (Batic and Raspor, 2000) up to 
0.45 mg/g dry weight. S. cerevisiae  (Krauter et al., 1996) accumulated 4 mg/g APPLICATIONS OF FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF HEAVY METALS 505TABLE 11.6 Uptake of Heavy Metals by White-Rot Fungi

dry weight and Cr(VI) uptake of 0.9 mg/g dry weight after 3 days (Kshemin-ska et al., 2003). Candida curvata  accumulated 11.1 mg/g dry weight of Cr(III) 
and Kluyveromyces lactis  3.3 mg/g dry weight of Cr(VI). Maximum accumu-
lation capabilities of Pichia guilliermondii  ranged between 4.0 and 13.0 mg/g 
dry weight for Cr(III) and 2 to 6/7 mg/g dry weight for Cr(VI) (Kaszycki et al., 2004). The total cellular chromium is 29.3 and 52.3% for Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively. Uranium can also be removed by combining biosorption and precipitation using brewery yeast (Riordan et al., 1997).
The thicker mannan layer and the larger surface area of S. cerevisiae
ATCC 834 appear to be responsible for the higher Cd(II) uptake capacity (Park et al., 2003). FTIR spectra of the protonated form and Ni(II) ion satu-rated yeast show that biosorption occurs primarily in the sugar and nucleic acid regions, involving —COOH and —NH groups (Padmavathy et al., 2003b). During Cd(II) biosorption by deactivated protonated yeast, the amount sorbed at equilibrium is directly proportional to the initial concentra-tion divided by the biomass (Vasudevan et al., 2003). There is evidence of silver-containing precipitates on both the cell wall and the intracellular com-ponents within the cell (Simmons and Singleton, 1996). A method to increase silver accumulation in the industrial strain of S. cerevisiae  has been proposed. 
Different yeasts isolated from the gold mining industry in Brazil bioaccumu-lated free and complexed silver ions (Gomes et al., 1999a). Toxic metals can be removed from an aqueous mixture containing copper, nickel, and zinc in the presence of existing co-cations (i.e., calcium and sodium ions) (Zouboulis et al., 1999). Table 11.7 shows the uptake of heavy metals by yeasts.
Crossﬂ  ow ﬁ  ltration can be used to remove heavy metal ions from water 
using yeast cells of S. cerevisiae  as carriers (Bayhan et al., 2001). The binding 
afﬁ nity of metal ions to yeast cells is Pb(II) > Cu(II) > Ni(II). In the presence 
of binary or ternary mixtures, rejection of the individual metal is reduced, except for Pb(II). Increased metal ion/yeast cell concentration reduces the total metal ion rejection in ternary mixtures.
11.6.4 Biosorption by  Aspergillus niger
The removal of metals such as lead, copper, and cadmium from aqueous solu-
tion by Aspergillus niger  is well recognized. Alkali-treated A. niger  biomass 
binds silver to 10% of dry weight (Akthar et al., 1995).

508A. niger  biomass is pretreated with formaldehyde, dimethyl sulfoxide, sodium 
hydroxide, and detergent compared to live biomass (Kapoor and Viraragha-van, 1998a). Live biomass removes nickel more effectively than does alkali-boiled biomass (Kapoor et al., 1999). Lead, copper, and cadmium display a lower adsorptive capacity when present together in solution than when present as individual metal ions in solution. During growth of A. niger  on gold mining 
solution containing cyano-metal complexes, gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc are accumulated due to the presence of metal precipitation on the cell surface (Gomes et al., 1999b). A. niger  has the capability to solubilize pyromorphite 
(Sayer et al., 1999). A. niger  and Trichoderma harzianum  also play a role in 
the solubilization of heavy metal sulﬁ  des (Grayston and Wainwright, 1988). 
Table 11.8 lists the uptake of heavy metals by A. niger .
11.6.4.1 Role in Soil Bioremediation.  Fungi are widespread in the natural 
environment and can be the dominant organisms in many soils, especially at low pH. Certain soil fungi can desorb metal ions at a wide range of pH levels. A process to bioremediate three types of soils contaminated with heavy metals has been developed using A. niger  (W asa y et al., 1998). The fungus 
biomass produces weak organic acids, mostly citric acid, for the leaching of heavy metals from the contaminated soils. Several types of metals are leached at different levels in loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam soils. These con-taminated soils can be further remediated to the Province of Quebec Stan-dards for heavy metals after 20 to 25 days. The process may be applied for in situ or ex situ mycoremediation at a cost of $5.00 per cubic meter.
11.7 FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF HERBICIDES AND PHENOLS
Table 11.9 shows the uptake of phenols by fungi. The living mycelia of Emeri-
cella nidulans  adsorb 15% of atrazine, 18% of 2,4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid 
(2,4-D), 29% of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), and 30% of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) (Benoit et al., 1998). No metabolites were detected in solutions con-taining atrazine, 2,4-D, and 2,4-DCP after 144 hours. Sorption of 4-CP showed the identiﬁ  cation of 4-chlorocatechol and two unidentiﬁ  ed compounds 
more polar than 4-CP, indicating biodegradation as the mechanism of action. Uptake by living mycelium in the fungal cells was due to the bioaccumulation of 4-CP, 2,4-DCP, and 2,4-D. Due to a large surface area, hyphae can aggre-gate to a mycelium, which can act as a biosorbent for the organic pollutants. Inactivated nonliving fungal biomass with freeze-dried preparations of both fungi shows rapid adsorption on fungal cell wall surfaces. Different species of Basidiomycetes display differences in adsorbed amounts of pentachloro-phenol (Logan et al., 1994). Uptake of 5 to 18% of pentachlorophenol occurred on mycelia. A macrofungus has shown the ability to adsorb endosulfan from water (Sudhakar and Dikshit, 1999). The fungus can remove 80% of endosulfan at an initial concentration of 10 mg/l after 24 hours.

sajor-caju  removed chlorophenols within 4 hours and sorption increased with 
increasing pH (Denizli et al., 2005). The sorption is in the preferential order 2,4,6-trichlorophenol >para -chlorophenol >ortho -chlorophenol > phenol. 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  attains a similar afﬁ  nity order with the same 
phenols (Denizli et al., 2004). Additional work is needed on the biosorption of herbicides and phenols, including elucidation of the mechanism of action and the process of metal biodegradation and bioaccumulation.
11.8 FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF DYES
Some information on the biosorption of dyes was given in Chapter 10. Table 
11.10 lists the color removal and biosorption capacities of various types of dyes by fungi. The dead and pulverized macrofungus Fomitopsis carnea dis-
plays an excellent uptake potential for all cationic dyes, and the afﬁ  nity of 
sorbent varies with the dye (Mittal and Gupta, 1996). The bottle point method is used for adsorption equilibria tests. The ﬁ  rst-order reaction kinetics 
describes the biosorption and dye transport. Sorption enhances with mixing intensity of 500 rpm and can be employed in the design of a batch reactor. A thermotolerant yeast,  Kluyveromyces marxianus  IMB3, decolorizes Remazol 
Black B, a vinyl sulfone type of reactive dye (Meehan et al., 2000). The maximum color removal was 98% at 37ºC and pH 5.0 within 18 hours. Addi-tion of heavy inoculum produced rapid decolorization. The yeast biomass did not decolorize under anaerobic conditions. The kinetic and equilibrium mod-eling of biosorption of this dye have also been studied in a batch system by dried Rhizopus arrhizus  (Aksu and Tezer, 2000). The fungal biomass exhib-
ited second-order kinetics.
11.9 FUNGAL BINARY AND TERNARY 
BIOSORPTION SYSTEMS
Fungal biosorption of single metal is quite common, whereas the competitive 
uptake of the multimetal mixtures is a complex process. The mechanism of mycosorption and reversibility versus irreversibility indicates interactive effects on the surface due to the presence of many metals in solution. These interactions are antagonistic or synergistic in nature and can potentially inﬂ  u-
ence the biochemical processes of fungi. Binary and ternary mycosorption involve competition of metals for the binding sites, metal combination and concentration, order of metal addition, and contact time.
11.9.1 Binary Biosorption Systems
Sorption of Ni(II) by R. arrhizus  has been shown to be antagonistic during 
the combined effect of Pb(II) and Ni(II) ions (Sag and Kutsal, 1997). The TABLE 11.10 Fungal Biosorption of Dyes

Pb(II) ions dominated competitive binding in binary metal mixtures. Sorp-
tion of Pb(II) during the interactive inﬂ  uences of Pb(II) and Ni(II) was syn-
ergistic at concentrations of Pb(II) ions at 1 0 and 25 mg/l, but at increasing concentrations of Ni(II) ions in the range 25 to 150 mg/l. Bioremoval of both Pb(II) and Ni(II) by R. arrhizus  can be achieved in batch-stirred reactors in 
series at pH 4.5. The ﬁ  rst reactor can remove a large concentration of Pb(II), 
and the second reactor, the residual Ni(II).
R. arrhizus  has a capacity for individual biosorption of Cr(VI) and Cu(II) 
from binary mixtures and antagonistic uptake of these combined metals (Sag and Kutsal, 1996a). The competitive equilibrium adsorption data of Cr(VI) and Fe(III) from binary mixtures by R. arrhizus  ﬁ t well in the competitive 
Langmuir model (Sag and Kutsal, 1996b). The models are applied for simul-taneous adsorption of Cu(II) and Zn(II) by R. arrhizus  (S a g  e t  al. ,  1 998).  
The binary sorption of Cr(VI) and Cu(II), and Cr(VI) and Fe(III), on freeR. arrhizus  in a packed column reactor in the continuous mode has been 
e x a m i n e d  ( S a g  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 9 ,  2 0 0 0 a ) .  T h e  c o m b i n e d  a c t i o n  o f  C r ( V I )  a n d  Fe(III) displayed an antagonistic behavior, as the other metal ions reduce the maximum column capacity and adsorption yield. The column equilibrium results of Cr(VI) and Cu(II), and Cr(VI) and Fe(III), on R. arrhizus  also 
correlated satisfactorily with the empirical Freundlich isotherms for the binary metal mixtures.
Experimental and model-predicted data of binary systems on R. arrhizus
in a CFST under operating conditions have been compared (Sag et al., 2000b). The adsorption uptake of Pb(II) and Cu(II) increases with increased concen-trations at a ﬁ  xed concentration of the competing metal ion. Pb(II) ions 
dominate competitive binding during binary mixture simultaneous adsorp-tion of Pb(II) and Cu(II). The combined action on Pb(II) and Ni(II) is antagonistic, as the removal of one metal decreases with increased concentra-tion of the other metal. The experimental results correlate reasonably well by the model. A mathematical model based on mass balances for the liquid and solid phases has been used to predict the performance of a binary system of Cr(VI) and Fe(III) on R. arrhizus  in a semibatch reactor (Sag et al., 2001). 
Forward and backward rate constants K
1 and K2 of single metal biosorption 
are modeled for binary adsorption. The adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) is greater than that of Fe(III), which correlates well with the single-component data. Cr(VI) adsorbs selectively from the mixture, but the selectivity of the biomass for Fe(III) increases with an increase in the ratio of concentrations of Fe(III) and Cr(VI) ions. The biosorption capacity of an individual metal ion has been shown to decrease in the presence of other metal ions using Mucor rouxii  biomass (Yan and Viraraghavan, 2003). Sorption of Pb(II) is 
lower in a two- or multimetal system. However, the total sorption capacity is increased more in three-metal ion systems than in bimetal ion systems. The sorption capacities of live Funalia trogii  immobilized in calcium–alginate gel 
beads and heat-inactivated form in multimetal ions systems are in the order Hg(II) > Cd(II) > Zn(II) ( Arica et al., 2004). The total sorption capacities of the immobilized preparations in a multimetal system are lower than in a 
single-metal system. The Pb(II) ions are more preferential than Cd(II) ions during simultaneous sorption by a biomass of P. chrysosporium  (Li et al., 
2004).
11.9.2 Ternary Biosorption Systems
Th e  c o m b in e d  e ff e c t  o f  t e rn a ry  m e t a l s  o n  R. arrhizus  i s  a n t a g o ni s t i c  ( S a g  
and Kutsal, 1998). The equilibrium uptake of Cr(VI) by R. arrhizus  occurs 
in the presence of increasing concentrations of Fe(III) and Cu(II). The Cr(VI) uptake depends on the ratio of the dominant metal ion to competing metal ions. The sorption capacity, selectivity, and biomass yield are enhanced by increasing the ratio of Cr(VI) concentration to other metal and/or to the total metal concentration. The Fe(III) ions show a more or less similar sorp-tion pattern, although Fe(II) ions compete strongly for the binding sites. On the contrary, adsorption of Cu(II) is signiﬁ  cantly low, due to poor afﬁ  nity 
a n d  l o w  u p t a k e  a t  p H  2. 0 .  A  h i g h e r  c a p a b i l i t y  o f  C r ( VI )  i s  e s t a b l i s h e d  t o  other metals, which correlates reasonably well with single and binary systems.
Experimental and model-predicted data of lead, nickel, and copper con-
centration proﬁ  les, and the metal ratios have been compared in a ternary 
system on R. arrhizus  in a CFST under optimum operating conditions (Sag 
et al., 2000b). Variations in the initial concentration of Pb(II) ions and the Ni(II) and Cu(II) ion concentrations constants were used. At equilibrium, adsorbed Pb(II) amoun t increased wi th an increasing Pb(II) concen tra tion and ratio to other metal ions. Sorption of Cu(II) and Ni(II) displayed a similar pattern. Signiﬁ  cant inhibition in metal uptake was noted in the pres-
ence of an increasing concentration of other metal ions. The equilibrium uptake was 48.79 mg Pb(II)/g, 25.78 Cu(II)/g, and 41.44 mg Ni(II)/g at con-stant metal concentrations. This implies a synergistic action due to metals interaction. In multimetal ternary systems using R. arrhizus  in batch-stirred 
reactors, the adsorption capacities displayed the preferential order Pb(II) >
Ni(II) > Cu(II) at pH 5.0 (Sag et al., 2000c). A CFST can handle large con-
centrations of multimetal solutions with greater biosorption yields and is applicable for the continuous treatment of large quantities of wastewaters. The multicomponent system of immobilized Mucor rouxii  in polysulfone 
matrix showed capacities of 0.36, 0.31, and 0.40 mg/g for Cd, Ni, and Zn, respectively, at each initial ion concentration of 5 mg/l (Yan and Viraragha-van, 2001). Nearly 50% removal of cadmium, nickel, and zinc occurred for 8, 7, and 8 bed volumes, respectively. The majority of Cd, Ni, and Zn ions were eluted in 6, 6, and 6.5 bed volumes, respectively, using 0.05 N HNO
3, similar 
to a single-component system. In a ternary system, Aspergillus niger  biomass 
displayed the adsorption of heavy metals in the preferential order lead >
copper > cadmium (Kapoor et al., 1999). Lead adsorption was more sensitive

presence of both copper and lead; and copper adsorption, to the presence of 
lead than cadmium.
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  has also been employed for competitive 
biosorption of Cd(II), Pb(II), and Cu(II) at an initial concentration of 100 mg/l and pH 6.0 (Say et al., 2001). Equilibrium was reached after 6 hours. The adsorption capacities were 7.80 mg for Cd(II), 16.91 mg for Pb(II), and 7.57 mg for Cu(II) per gram of dry fungal biomass. The competitive adsorption capac-ities for these metals were lower than under noncompetitive conditions. A combination of Pb(II) or Cu(II) and chromate ions was synergistic for Cr(VI) sorption in Candida utilis  cells (Muter et al., 2002).
11.9.3 Effect of Co-cations
In binary and ternary systems, the presence of metal ions also affects the 
biosorption efﬁ  ciency. In ternary systems, the uptake capacity of Saccharo-
myces cerevisiae  and Penicillium chrysogenum  is halved compared to single-
metal ion sorption (Bakkaloglu et al., 1998). This is due to the presence of co-cations that reduce the capacity of the biomass. Co-cations (e.g., cadmium, copper, cobalt and nickel) have certain effects on lead and zinc biosorption by Streptoverticillium cinnamoneum  and P. chrysogenum  in binary and mul-
timetal systems (Puranik and Paknikar, 1999). S. cinnamoneum  exhibits a 
higher adsorptive capacity than that of P. chrysogenum  for all metals. The 
uptake of lead is preferred in a multimetal solution by both types of fungal biomass. All binary systems containing zinc show mutual inhibition, and an unequal inhibition is noted in systems containing lead. The respective sorp-tion order of S. cinnamoneum  and P. chrysogenum  is Pb(II) > Zn(II) =
Cu(II) > Cd(II) > Ni(II) > Co(II) and Pb(II) > Cu(II) > Zn(II) > Cd(II) >
Ni(II) > Co(II).
11.10 BIOSORPTION OF HEAVY METAL ANIONS
Most work is performed on the removal of heavy metal cations; little is known 
about the uptake of anions by a fungal biomass. Chitosan beads are known to remove molybdate (MoO
42−). Chitosan is mixed with glutaraldehyde to 
prevent the dissolution of beads under acidic conditions. Pure and mixed cultures of fungi have been found to biodegrade metal cyanides (Barclay et al., 1998). A mixed culture of Fusarium solani  and Trichoderma polysporum
was obtained on tetracyanonickelate [K
2Ni(CN) 4] at pH 4.0. A second mixed 
culture of three fungi (i.e., Fusarium oxysporum ,Scytalidium thermophilum ,
and Penicillium miczynski ) occurred on hexacyanoferrate [K 4Fe(CN) 6] at pH 
4.0. The culture supernatant displayed 50% removal of the total cyanide associated with the termination of growth. Cyanide was removed in 5 days by cultivation of Fusarium  isolated on [K
2Ni(CN) 4] at pH 7.0 and occurred 
simultaneously with removal of iron on [K 4Fe(CN) 6] at pH 4.0 by the fungi. Cyanide metabolism by fungi and molecular biology of cyanide degradation 
has been reviewed by Barclay and Knowles (2001). A pathway for the utiliza-tion of cyanide by Fusarium solani  has also been depicted.
Initial pH, initial Fe(III)–cyanide complex anions, and biosorbent con-
centration play a good role in the binding capacity to Rhizopus arrhizus
(Aksu et al., 1999). pH 13.0 was responsible for the decrease in Fe(III)–cyanide complex anions. The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich–Peterson models correlated well with the equilibrium data at pH 3.0, 7.0, and 13.0, respectively. There is a good scope for the uptake of Fe(III)–cyanide complex a n i o n s  i n  h i g h  c o n c e n t r a t i o n s  o f  w a s t e w a t e r s ,  u p  t o  2 0 0 0  m g / l .  A  c a t i o n i c  surfactant-modiﬁ  ed yeast substantially improved the removal of chromate 
anions (CrO
42−) from the aqueous stream (Bingol et al., 2004). Nearly 99.5% 
metal ions were removed from the solution at an initial concentration of 5.2 to 2.8 mg/l Cr(VI) and pH 4.5 to 5.5. More work is required on the biosorp-tion of anions, including the mechanism.
11.11 METAL ION RESISTANCE
Some fungi have the ability to survive in an environment containing excessive 
concentrations of metal ions and tend to become metal-resistant. Metal ion r e s i s t a n c e  c a n  b e  a t t r i b u t e d  t o  d i f f e r e n c e s  i n  u p t a k e  o r  t r a n s p o r t  o f  t o x i c  metals. It is important to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this response and the adaptation of various fungal species to metal stress. Intracel-lular chelation is an established mechanism in metal tolerance. Fungal cells have certain mechanisms to maintain metal homeostasis and prevent metal toxicity. Glutathione (GSH), metal-binding peptides, metallothionein-like peptides, and sulﬁ  de ions play roles in such mechanisms. Cellular metal stress 
triggers the biosynthesis of some of these molecules, which are regulated via intracellular metal sensors.
Metallothioneins (MTs) are gene-encoded cysteine-rich metal-binding 
proteins of low molecular weight that are found in fungi, plants, microorgan-isms, and animals (Clemens et al., 2003). They bind with heavy metals through clusters of thiolate bonds. Several metals induce the synthesis of phytochela-tins (PCs), but the formation of a phytochelatin–metal complex is studied largely with Cu(II) and Cd(II). Incorporation of copper led to the formation of Cu(I)–metallothionein in intact Saccharomyces cerevisiae  cells (Presta 
and Stillman, 1997). A high concentration of Cu(II) triggered the production of an MT in Candida glabrata  and Cd(II) stress mainly to PCs (Mehra et al., 
1988, 1989). Neurospora crassa synthesized an MT which belongs to family 
8 of the MT classes only upon copper exposure, not due to oxidative stress (Kumar et al., 2005) (www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/lists/metallo.txt). Heliscus lug-
dunensis  and Verticillium  cf. alboatrum  increased the GSH pool with increas-
ing Cd(II) concentration (Jaeckel et al., 2005a). Cadmium stress responded to simultaneous induction of MT and PC followed by an increase in the GSH METAL ION RESISTANCE 517518 FUNGAL BIOSORPTION OF HEAVY  METALS
level in H. lugdunensis  (Jaeckel et al., 2005b). The MTs and PCs could be the 
future biomarker tools in fungi if the analytical protocols for heavy-metal chelating properties are differentiated and reﬁ  ned.
Acid phosphatases are described in many ﬁ  lamentous fungi, but little is 
known on their participation in the mechanisms of heavy metal resistance. A. niger  produced extracellular and cellular acid phosphatase activities during 
growth in the presence or absence of copper ions (Tsekova et al., 2002). The copper uptake by mycelia was highest when the enzyme levels were maximal. About 10% of copper ions were bound intracellularly by mycelia of different age and were not removed by acid washing. Mycelium accumulates more c o p p e r  a n d  p r o d u c e s  m o r e  a c i d  p h o s p h a t a s e s  i n  t h e  p r e s e n c e  o f  h i g h e r  concentration. Phosphatase overproduction and enhanced metal uptake by mycelia indicated a possible detoxiﬁ  cation mechanism in the resistance to 
copper.
A high growth rate followed by a weaker death rate indicates the tolerance 
development in fungi. Strong growth followed by a high death rate shows poor tolerance. Heavy metal tolerance genes may be future tools for mycoremedia-tion. Schizosaccharomyces pombe  is a model system for the chelation and 
transport of cadmium (Ow, 1996). A gene hmt1  for heavy metal resistance 
encoding a vacuolar membrane protein has been isolated that belongs to a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type of transporter family (Ortiz et al., 1992). Cadmium tolerance in S. pombe  requires two purine biosyn-
thetic enzymes (Juang et al., 1993). With the identiﬁ  cation of the target genes 
in this model organism or other fungus, their sequences can be modiﬁ  ed for 
heterologous or homologous expression. A total of 177 heavy metal–resistant mutants of Trichoderma  have been isolated and tested for cross-resistance to 
other heavy metals (Kredics et al., 2001). Some mutants are effective on media containing the respective heavy metals.
11.12 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The persistence of metals in the environment leads to a quest for new tech-
nologies. The unique, versatile, and innovative process of fungal biosorption started to gain importance in the 1980s. The applications highlighted above are clearly indicators of success in fungal biosorption. More information is now available on different types of fungal biomass and biosorbents for the uptake of metals. The development of metal-resistant species is still in infancy. The best combination of biomass type, environmental conditions, and choice of metals are explored sufﬁ  ciently in single-metal systems. The use of dead 
biomass is established as a substitute for ion-exchange resins. The role of fungi in the sorption of heavy metals may lead to the development of emerg-ing technology for the treatment of mineral-processing wastewater. A new door of opportunity for cost-effective technology will open in this century with regulatory criteria.REFERENCES 519
The suitability of metal desorption, regeneration, and multiple reuse of 
biomass is equally important. The mechanism of metal binding by a fungal cell wall can give new insights to optimize the process of operation. The dif-ferent cell wall constituents can be manipulated chemically. Similarly, genetic manipula tion of ce ll walls re la ted to the uptak e capaci ty and used to wi th-stand high dose of metals can be exploited. This suggests a need for the development by bioengineering techniques of fungal biomass and biopoly-mers of increased metal capacities and speciﬁ  cities. Only then can the fungal 
biosorbents of new generation with higher speciﬁ  cities be produced.
Fungi can play a key role in determining the fate of metals in soil 
ecosystems and act as signiﬁ  cant potential agents in the mycoremediation of 
metal-contaminated soils. Several species isolated from the polluted sites show excellent capabilities for metal scavenging. Fungi surviving and accu-mulating the metals from contaminated soils are the best targets for success-ful mycoremediation. Understanding translocation within the mycelium is essential for the accumulation of metals by ﬁ  lamentous fungi in soil. Rapid 
translocation makes possible an enhanced capacity for the sequestration of metals. The introduction of ﬁ  lamentous fungi into the contaminated soils will 
absorb and translocate the metals, which eventually are concentrated in the basidiocarps. Basidiocarps can then be harvested and metals are extracted for recycling or disposal. A simple and inexpensive method for in situ reme-diation of metal-contaminated soil by fungi will be of great beneﬁ  t in the 
future.

ternary metal systems. Mathematical models to predict the performance of a sorptive system under different operating conditions can provide valuable knowledge to the system. At present computer models are unknown in biosorption technology, but there is a great scope for the exploitation of com-puter models based on metal interaction and mass transfer and hydrodynam-ics to optimize process design. Interdisciplinary research on proven physicochemical processes integrated with a biological process and fusion of different scientiﬁ  c and engineering disciplines should achieve the full poten-
tial of mycosorption.

MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN 
RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION
12.1 INTRODUCTION
Mycorrhizas are symbiotic associations between certain soil fungi and plant 
roots and are ubiquitous in the natural environments. Their role in nutrient transport in ecosystems and protection of plants against environmental and cultural stress has long been known. The majority of the mycorrhizas are obligate symbionts because they have little or no ability for independent growth. Autobionts are not much involved in associations. By combining the structure and functional aspects of symbiosis, Trappe (1996) deﬁ  ned mycor-
r h i z a s  a s  “ d u a l  o r g a n s  o f  a b s o r p t i o n  f o r m e d  w h e n  s y m b i o t i c  f u n g i  i n h a b i t  healthy organs of most terrestrial plants.” Smith and Read (1997) deﬁ  ned a 
mycorrhiza as “a symbiosis in which an external mycelium of a fungus sup-plies soil-derived nutrients to a plant root.” Due to research over the past ﬁ  ve 
decades, several excellent books on mycorrhizas have been produced (e.g., Marks and Kozlowski, 1973; Harley and Smith, 1983; Allen, 1991; Smith and Read, 1997; Ramarao, 2002). Varma and Hock (1999) covered the mycor-rhiza structure, function, molecular biology, and biotechnology. Read (1999) described the state of the art on mycorrhizas, including various deﬁ  nitions, 
contributions of mycorrhizas to the ﬁ  tness of plants, enhanced pathogen 
resistance as a basis of increased ﬁ  tness, and contribution of mycorrhizas in 
natural communities.
The vesicular–arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) is the most ancient type of 
association and colonizes the plants by scavenging for phosphate. About two-

thirds of plants are known to have a VAM type of association. The VAM 
association belongs to nearly 150 taxa of the Order Glomales. The second common type in the environmental systems are the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. The important differences between the ECM and VAM fungi have been summarized (Colpaert and Van Tichelen, 1996). The ECM fungi are more specialized in nutrient capture, and both fungi differ in the quantity of production of external biomass. These fungi are also called extremophiles ,
due to their occurrence in extreme habitats, including high or low tempera-ture, pH, salt and metal concentration, drought, and so on. The growth of mycorrhizas is also known in the presence of low availability of nutrients that could increase plant growth.
The role of mycorrhizal fungi related to metal uptake and degradation of 
persistent organic compounds is emphasized in this chapter. The symbiotic relationship allows the fungus to tide over the harsh conditions of toxic con-tamination. The rhizosphere zone around the roots of plants is the active seat of metabolic substrates responsible for the growth and survival of fungi in soil ecosystems. The fungi and plant can extend nutrients to each other. However, the supply of nutrients in nutrient-deﬁ  cient ecosystems by mycorrhizal fungi 
to the host plant is quite interesting. The role of mycorrhizas in rhizosphere remediation and of ECM fungi to degrade a wide variety of persistent organic compounds has ﬁ  nally been established (Meharg and Cairney, 2000a).
12.2 CLASSIFICATION OF MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI
Several different types of mycorrhizal associations have been classiﬁ  ed from 
time to time by different mycologists. Certain species of fungi exhibit a narrow host range of plants, whereas others have a broad range. Worldwide distribution and a broad host range are known for the ECM fungus Pisoli-
thus tinctorius . Some associations in forests are speciﬁ  c, whereas others 
are nonspeciﬁ  c. Some mycorrhizal associations inﬂ  uence the pattern of 
plant communities. The diverse communities of ECM, VAM, and ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) fungi are known at many host plant root systems. The speciﬁ  c i t y  o f  E C M  f u n g i  i s  w e l l  e x p r e s s e d .  I n  a  s o i l  e n v i r o n m e n t ,  l e v e l s

Seven different types of associations have been classiﬁ  ed: arbuscular, ecto-
mycorrhiza, ectendomycorrhiza, ericoid, arbutoid, orchid, and monotrophic (Smith and Read, 1997). These categories are based on the criteria of the type of the fungus involved and the resulting structures produced by the root–fungus association. The host cells are not penetrated by ectotrophic mycorrhiza and form an intercellular hyphal network in a sheath around the plant roots. The host cells are penetrated by endomycorrhiza with a superﬁ  cial hyphal network on the root surface. Read (1999) recognized six categories based on the structural and major nutrient pathways. Such asso-
ciations may not be mutualistic at all levels with respect to time. Manuals for the identiﬁ  cation of mycorrhizal fungi (Ingleby et al., 1990; Schenck and 
Perez, 1990) have been published and a mycorrhizal manual (Varma, 1998) has been edited. Identiﬁ  cation of V AM fungi is well epitomized in an article 
by Douds and Millner (1999). The anatomical characteristics of ectomycor-rhizas (Agerer, 1999) and the morphological diversity among endomycorrhi-zal fungi in Glomales (Morton et al., 1999) related to systematics and natural classiﬁ  cation have been described.
More than 6000 ECM fungal species (Molina et al., 1992; Bougher, 1994) 
and over 5400 species from 148 ECM genera (Allen et al., 1995) are known in the world. Ectomycorrhizal community structures have recently been described with reference to common taxa (Gehring et al., 1998; Jonsson et al., 1999a,b) and metabolism and gene expression (Wiemken and Boller, 2002). Olsson et al. (1996) demonstrated a reduction in or lack of bacterial activity near the mycelial network of ECM fungi. Bacterial populations can be inhibited as a result of nutrient competition by an extensive mycelium in the mycorrhizosphere (Green et al., 1999b).
12.3 FUNCTIONS OF MYCORRHIZAL MYCELIUM
One of the functions of the fungal mycelium associated with host plants is to 
enhance the volume of rhizosphere soil. Dominance of the mycelium in the upper soil layers is well known in temperate forest ecosystems, where it accounts for 45% of the total soil biomass. Undoubtedly, mycorrhizas have certain applications in agroforestry, soil stabilization, and land rehabilitation. Ectomycorrhizal fungi mobilize certain essential plant nutrients from rock by excreting a range of organic acids (van Breemen et al., 2000; Landeweert et al., 2001). This assists ectomycorrhizal plants to assimilate nutrients from insoluble sources of mineral and thus affects nutrient cycling in forests. However, in recent years, attention has been focused on the functions of the ectomycorrhizal mycelium in relation to transport.
Species of ECM fungi are similar to certain wood-rotting fungi in the 
pattern of mycelial growth and differentiation. The mycelium systems of mycorrhizal fungi are heterogeneous. The mycelium of ectomycorrhizal roots increases the efﬁ  ciency of soil exploration in microcosms. In certain cases, 
mycelia are reported to exceed 300 m
2 ( B o n e ll o  e t  al . ,  1 998;  S a wy e r  e t  al . ,  
1999). Mycelial lengths of up to 2000 m/m root (Read and Boyd, 1986), 504 m/m (Rousseau et al., 1994), and 300 m/m (Jones et al., 1991) have also been noted. Smith and Read (1997) reported a mycelial surface area up to 47-fold. Hyphal lengths from 200 mg dry weight to 6.4 m in relation to soil weight have been recorded. Proliferation of fungal mycelia in the form of patches or mats in certain soils is also observed in microcosms and ﬁ  elds. This 
results in the capture of certain nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus.FUNCTIONS OF MYCORRHIZAL MYCELIUM 535536 MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION
12.4 METHODS FOR STUDYING MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI
Several methods are known for the isolation of spores from the ﬁ  eld soil for 
the study of ectomycorrhizal fungi: sieving and decanting (Vilarino and Arines, 1990; Douds and Millner, 1999), ﬂ  otation–adhesion (Sutton and 
Barron, 1972), airstream fractionation (Tommerup, 1982), different water–sucrose centrifugation (Ianson and Allen, 1986), and ﬁ  xing soil slurries to 
ﬁ lter paper (Smith and Skipper, 1979; Khalil et al., 1994). A variation of the 
most probable number (MPN) method is used for the determination of colony-forming units (CFU) in fungi or bacteria (An et al., 1990). Trap culture techniques are applied for the detection of nonsporulating species. The quan-tiﬁ cation of V AM colonization of roots is through a dissecting microscope 
followed by staining with certain dyes. Quantiﬁ  cation of fungal colonization 
is performed through microscopy or by measurement of fungus-speciﬁ  c com-
pounds in the roots. Giovannetti and Mosse (1980) applied microscopy along with a gridline intersect method. The gridline intersect method has also been modiﬁ  ed (McGonigle et al., 1990). Techniques for the study of mycorrhizal 
fungi (Norris et al., 1991, 1992) and a manual for basic techniques on the mycorrhizal research, including the establishment of micropropagated plants (Mukerji et al., 2002), have been discussed.
Several methods are known for the production of mycorrhizal inoculum 
and inoculum techniques (Kuek, 1994; Haselwandter and Bowen, 1996). Molina and Palmer (1982) described the isolation, maintenance, and pure culture of ECM fungi. A technique has been established to study ECM fungi on agar media (De Araujo and Roussos, 2002). Suillus collinitus  and Hebe-
loma cylindrosporum  ha v e been grown on potato de xtrose agar or Pintro ’ s 
medium. The various methods have been compared to determine the metal sensitivity in ECM fungi in culture in the absence of a host and in symbiosis with a host in artiﬁ  cial substrates (Hartley et al., 1997). Protocols have been 
developed to study the effects of hydrocarbon pollution on VAM fungi (Cabello, 2001).
Fatty acids from abundant phospholipids (membrane structures) and 
neutral lipids (storage structures) of VAM fungi can be useful for estimating the biomass of infective VAM propagules. The biomass of the extraradical mycelium is 10-fold more than that of intraradical mycelium in V AM fungi (Olsson et al., 1999). Colpaert and Van Tichelen (1996) discussed many examples of the production of estimated biomass. The differences in fatty acid proﬁ  les are also beneﬁ  cial in the identiﬁ  cation of these fungi (Graham 
et al., 1995). Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) proﬁ  les can be coupled with 
radio- or stable-isotope analysis to distinguish the amount or presence of fungal or bacterial biomass (Green et al., 1999a). Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis was performed on the spores of four VAM fungi in a study by Madan et al. (2002). The FAME proﬁ  les conﬁ  rm the use of 16 : 1 ω5c as a 
marker fatty acid for VAM fungi in controlled environments and suggest 18 : 1 ω9c, 20 : 1 ω9c, 20 : 2 ω6c, and 22 : 1 ω9c as possible markers for the detec-
tion of Gigaspora margarita . The fatty acid 16 : 1 ω5c was used to estimate the 
biomass of external mycelium of Glomus geosporum  (Gaspar et al., 2002). 
Measuring the quantity of campesterol, 24 α-methylcholesterol (Schmitz et 
al., 1991), ergosterol (Frey et al., 1994), and yellow carotenoid pigments in some mycorrhizal roots is also related to the extent of VAM colonization. Measurement of chitin is a common method for the determination of coloni-zation of V AM fungi in roots. Chitin assays cannot distinguish between living and dead mycelia and provide variable results, due to differences in cell wall morphology.
Immunochemical methods are also known for the identiﬁ  cation of these 
fungi. Different isolates can be identiﬁ  ed with the production of monoclonal 
antibodies (Wright et al., 1987). The immunochemical properties of mycor-rhizas are related to applications in taxonomy, host–symbiont dialogue, and ecological aspects (Hahn et al., 1999). A ﬂ  owchart of specimen preparation 
for the study of ectomycorrhiza and optimal preparation pathways for cytochemical, immunocytochemical, microanalytical, and ultrastructural investigations have been discussed (Scheidegger and Brunner, 1999). Elec-tron energy loss spectrometry (EELS), electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI), and energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis (EDX) are widely used in mycor-rhizal research.
Molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restric-
tion fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) are also used in the identiﬁ  cation 
of mycorrhizal fungi. A VANS1–NS21 primer pair with PCR has been used to detect VAM fungi colonizing roots of various plants (Simon et al., 1992; Di Bonito et al., 1995). These methods have gained success by amplifying nuclear DNA encoding for small-subunit rRNA and internal transcribed regions. A competitive PCR method has been developed in Hebeloma cylin-
drosporum  that quantiﬁ  es its DNA in complex mixtures extracted from soil 
( Gui d o t e t al. , 2002). Th e d e tecti o n thr esh o l d o f this p r o t oco l is 0.03 p g o f g e n o m i c  D N A .  T h i s  m e t h o d  i s  a p p l i c a b l e  t o  b e l o w g r o u n d  b i o m a s s  u n d e r -neath fruiting bodies and very close to them. A combination of morphotype and molecular technique using a primer, NL6B, has been employed to describe ectomycorrhizas (Goodman et al., 1996). Sequence-based markers to study the genetic structure and reproductive biology of Suillus pungens , including 
the basidiome genotypes, have been examined (Bonello et al., 1998). The genetic distribution and variation of Cortinarius rotundisporus  by microsatel-
lite-primed PCR (MS-PCR) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ampliﬁ  ca-
tion and ITS-RFLP were studied by Sawyer et al. (1999). Kreuzinger et al. (1996) concluded that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( gpd)
genes could be used in the identiﬁ  cation of ectomycorrhizal fungi under ﬁ  eld 
conditions. Taxon-speciﬁ  c oligonucleotide probes have also been used to 
identify the fungal components of ectomycorrhizas (Bruns and Gardes, 1993). A combination of PCR and an oligonucleotide probe successfully identiﬁ  ed METHODS FOR STUDYING MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI 537538 MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION

detected in cultivated soils using a PCR-denaturing gradient gel electropho-resis (DGGE) method for fungal 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Ma et al., 2005). Recently, the mycelium of the ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil has been quanti-ﬁ ed by real-time PCR (Landeweert et al., 2003).
12.5 MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF 
MYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSIS
At present, the molecular mechanisms of establishment of symbiotic mycor-
rhizas are not understood. A series of events are involved during interaction between the fungus and root cells, resulting in an integrated functional struc-ture. This appears to be caused by activating and deactivating of genes in both fungus and host plant. Certain elicitors are produced by the root cells that regulate the expression of fungal genes to establish symbiosis (Burgess et al., 1995). Certain genes are activated, which are responsible for the development of a Hartig net and hyphal mantle (Salzer et al., 1997) and the deactivating of certain fungal gene encoding factors for host plant defense reactions. Certain elicitors present in ectomycorrhizal fungi are deactivated by chitin-ases of the root cortex without harming the fungus, thus establishing the formation of ectomycorrhizas (Salzer and Boller, 2000). The roots of host plants secrete signal molecule(s) that inﬂ  uence the growth of hyphae in VAM 
fungi in soil (Douds and Nagahashi, 2000). A dilute signal produces the hyphal branching pattern of Gigaspora gigantea  in the form of long, scattered 
branches, and a concentrated signal causes tight clusters of profuse branching. This branching response is a mechanism suitable for host root colonization. Signaling mechanisms and molecular genetics of mycorrhizal symbiosis and genetic engineering of mycorrhizal fungi are described in a book edited by Podila and Douds (2000). A comparative analysis of molecular aspects of symbiosis, molecular regulation of nutrient exchange, and techniques of genetic transformation of viable transgenic mycorrhizal fungi have been described (Krishna, 2004). Stable genetic transformation and the expression of gene markers in transgenic Pisolithus tinctorius  have recently been reported 
(Rodriguez-Tovar et al., 2005).
An in vitro Laccaria bicolor  and Pinus resinosa  interaction model system 
has been developed to identify and clone a symbiosis-regulated gene employ-ing an mRNA differential display technique (DDRT-PCR) (Kim et al., 1998). The gene corresponding to PF6.2 is isolated and sequenced. Northern analy-sis reveals detection of PF6.2 mRNA in 6 hours after interaction and contin-ues to be expressed in established ectomycorrhizas, suggesting its role in the formation and maintenance of symbiosis. This is the ﬁ  rst report of cloning 
and characterization of a gene from ECM fungus involved in the initiation and maintenance of symbiosis.12.6 METABOLISM OF MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI
12.6.1 General Metabolism
A supply of carbon by the host is necessary for the development of mycor-
rhizas. The establishment and maintenance of energy requirements for trans-port processes are important for both partners. A plethora of literature exists o n  t h e  c a r b o h y d r a t e  a n d  e n e r g y  m e t a b o l i s m  o f  m y c o r r h i z a s .  N i t r o g e n  i s  also an essential nutrient for ectomycorrhizal fungi. Many researchers have described nitrogen assimilation, processes of uptake, and the physiology of organic nitrogen acquisition. Transfer cell structures within ECM fungi are also well recognized. Transport of nitrogen by ectomycorrhizal tissues, the soil–fungus interface, the fungus–apoplast interface, the apoplast–root cell interface, the quality of nitrogen compounds transferred, and the membrane transport has been featured by Chalot and Brun (1998), including a hypo-thetical model of transport systems for nitrogenous compounds in mycorrhizas.
12.6.2 Degradative Metabolism
The ECM fungi produce a variety of enzymes for the degradation of complex 
organic compounds in the soil. Mobilization of nitrogen from organic matter takes place by hydrolytic enzymes (proteinases and peptidases) in certain ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Extracellular proteinase activities are detected in ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi on protein as a major growth substrate. Exocellular proteinase activities can be produced and are charac-terized in ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Several ECM fungi also produce amylase, gelatinase, lipase, and urease (Hutchinson, 1990). Certain mat-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi show elevated levels of cellulase, phosphatase, peroxidase, proteinase, and so on, compared to nonmat types.
Several VAM fungi produce xylanases, mannases, and other glycanase 
complexes that may aid in the partial degradation of hazardous compounds. Cellulolytic enzyme activities in ECM fungi have also been detected (Maijala et al., 1991). Cairney and Burke (1996) reported the expression of extracel-lular endoxylanase activity by four isolates in both ECM and ERM fungi, and the highest activity was recorded in Hymenoscyphus ericae . These enzymes 
may play a role at the fungus–root interface and in extramatrical mycelium in ECM and ERM fungi. Chitinases play a role in morphogenesis with multiple functions. The current status of hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., cellu-lases, hemicellulases, pectinases, and chitinases) from VAM fungi has been described (Varma, 1999).
Some ECM and ERM fungi contribute a wide range of phenol-oxidizing 
enzymes, such as tyrosinase, catechol oxidase, ascorbate oxidase, and laccase (Bending and Read, 1995; Colpaert and Van Laere, 1996; Gramss, 1997; Timonen and Sen, 1998; Burke and Cairney, 2002). The activities of non-METABOLISM OF MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI 539540 MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION
speciﬁ  c phenol oxidase enzymes in axenic culture and symbiosis are known 
in ECM fungi (Bending and Read, 1996a; Gunther et al., 1998; Gramss et al., 1999). Exolaccase production by Thelephora terrestris  (Kanunfre and Zancan, 
1998) is known to catalyze oxidation of phenols to phenoxy radicals. The oxidases can be responsible for the transformation of PAHs, but this has not been conﬁ  rmed.
Bavendamm test is employed for the detection of extracellular oxidases 
and agar spot tests for tyrosinase, laccase, and peroxidase enzymes in ECM and in wood- and litter-decaying fungi (Gramss et al., 1998). Remarkable extracellular oxidase activities have been detected in species of Lactarius  and 
Russula . Tyrosinase has been detected in all isolates. The spot test color is 
restricted to the mycelium, suggesting an intracellular enzyme in species of Amanita ,Hebeloma ,Leccinum ,Suillus , and Tricholoma . A strong extracel-
lular laccase reaction has also been observed. However, intracellular laccase dominates in some ECM fungi. All isolates show polyphenol oxidase as the catecholase/monophenol monoxygenase complex despite difﬁ  cult detection 
in the presence of laccase. Burke and Cairney (2002) summarized assay and substrate of polyphenol oxidase activities, including laccase from tissues of ERM and ECM fungi. Polyphenol activity in the taxonomy of ECM fungi in axenic culture has been proposed (Hutchinson, 1990). Four groups have been identiﬁ  ed based on the detection or nondetection of laccase and tyrosinase. 
Liquid culture mycelia of Suillus granulatus  produced intracellular activities 
in tyrosinase, laccase, and peroxidase (Gunther et al., 1998). Extracellular laccase and tyrosinase activities are also found in the culture ﬂ  uid. Paxillus 
involutus  produces mainly intracellular laccase. Tyrosinase activity is found 
in Suillus granulatus -Pinus sylvestris  symbiosis. The release of these enzymes 
can contribute humiﬁ  cation and detoxiﬁ  cation processes in soil.
Several studies indicate the partial mineralization of lignin by both ERM 
and ECM fungi. This appears to be indicative of the production of peroxida-tive enzymes (i.e., lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase) (Grifﬁ  ths 
and Caldwell, 1992; Cairney and Burke, 1994). Cairney and Burke (1998) a t t e s t e d  t h a t  n o  e v i d e n c e  e x i s t e d  t o  s u p p o r t  t h e  p r o d u c t i o n  o f  p e r o x i d a s e  enzymes by ERM and ECM fungi but that the enzymes could be expressed under certain circumstances. The detection of low lignocellulase activity in both mycorrhizal fungi (Colpaert and Van Laere, 1996) indicates a limited capacity to decompose the lignocellulose components. The same seems true of such a low activity in the ﬁ  eld conditions. Isolates of the ERM fungus 
Hymenoscyphus ericae  and the ECM fungi Suillus variegatus and Pisolithus 
tinctorius  are capable of producing extracellular H
2O2 during axenic growth 
on modiﬁ  ed Melin–Norkrans agar medium (MMN) containing either glucose 
or cellobiose as a carbon source (Burke and Cairney, 1998). Cellobiohydro-lase, β-d-glucosidase, cellobiose oxidase, and glucose oxidase activities are 
expressed on glucose- and cellobiose-containing media, respectively. Cello-biose oxidase appears to be localized in the periplasm. This was already known in wood-degrading fungi, where it excretes H
2O2 from hyphae, and this is a ﬁ  rst step in lignin degradation by saprophytic fungi. The mycelial 
extracts of all isolates generate the hydroxyl radical (·OH) in the presence of cellobiose and Fe(III), mediated by H
2O2 p r o d u c e d  b y  c e l l o b i o s e  o x i d a s e  
activity. Chambers et al. (1999) demonstrated MnP activity in Tylospora 
ﬁ brillosa  and a gene equivalent to a known isozyme from Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium . Recent data support the identiﬁ  cation of genes of lignin per-
oxidase and to a lesser extent, manganese peroxidase in a broad taxonomic range of ECM fungi (Chen et al., 2001). It appears that these enzymes are induced under certain conditions in some taxa.
12.7 UPTAKE OF TOXIC METALS
Plants that grow on heavily polluted soils are known as mycotrophic. ECM, 
ERM, and VAM fungi can increase plant tolerance to heavy metals at toxic concentrations. This is due to the accumulation of metals in extramatrical hyphae and extrahyphal slime. This leads to the immobilization of metals in or near roots and decreases uptake to shoots. Increased levels of metal tolerance to plants are not known in all mycorrhizal associations, due to differences in inﬂ  uence on plant metal tolerance. ECM fungi may be useful 
as bioindicators of pollution (Haselwandter et al., 1988; Aruguete et al., 1998).
Mine spoils are good target sites from which to study the application of 
mycorrhizal fungi. The inﬂ  uence of soil acidiﬁ  cation is generally difﬁ  cult to 
separate from the inﬂ  uence of metals. Many ECM fungi are associated with 
acidic, nutrient-poor soils in coniferous forests, and these acidic soils increase the solubility of Al and Mn ions (Dighton and Jansen, 1991). Species of ECM fungi exhibit constitutive tolerance to acidic conditions and high metal concentrations. Inoculation with Pisolithus tinctorius  a t  t h e  r o o t  o f  Pinus

12.7.1 Metal Tolerance in Mycorrhizal Symbiosis
ECM fungi are metal sensitive in pure solid and liquid cultures. Based on soil 
concentration , Pinus  and Pices  seedlings can be protected from heavy metal 
toxicity by Suillus luteus  (Dixon and Buschena, 1988). VAM fungi decrease 
the concentrations of Cd, Mn, and Zn in leaves of host plants in highly metal-polluted soils (Heggo et al., 1990; Hetrick et al., 1994). A metal tolerance of ECM fungi in symbiosis with a host plant is noted in Table 12.1. Several studies are known for in vitro tolerance of ECM fungi against heavy metals. Perhaps no correlation exists between in vitro tolerance of fungi and their expression of increased metal tolerance of plants. A combination of in vitro, in vivo, and ﬁ  eld studies are important for the evaluation of metal tolerance 
of ECM fungi. The percentage of mycorrhizal root tips can be related to the UPTAKE OF TOXIC METALS 541TABLE 12.1 Metal Tolerance of Mycorrhizal Fungi in Symbiosis

under in vivo conditions indicates a potential for future inoculations of Euca-
lyptus  on ultramaﬁ  c soils (Aggangan et al., 1998).
Mycorrhizas of Cortinarius semisanguinea  exhibit the highest mean levels 
of Cu and Zn, while those of Russula spp. and Suillus spp. display the highest 
mean levels of Pb and Cd, respectively (Berthelsen et al., 1995). These authors also discuss the various morphological types. Levels of Zn ( ∼38%), Cd ( ∼33%), 
and Pb ( ∼2%), respectively, were accumulated in the fungal biomass. Increas-
ing the Pb concentration produced different ECM morphotypes in soil (Chappelka et al., 1991). In glasshouse investigations, ﬁ  ve ECM morphotypes 
were identiﬁ  ed in association with seedlings of Pinus sylvestris  (Hartley, 
1997). H o w e v e r , the addi ti on o f Cd > 20 mg/kg soil or Zn > 200 mg/kg soil 
revealed only two morphotypes.
Smith and Read (1997) propounded several different mechanisms for the 
interactions between colonization of mycorrhizas and accumulation of heavy metals, including interactions with phosphorus nutrition leading to tissue dilution of the toxic element, metal sequestration, and tolerance development by the fungus. However, the results presented by Zhu et al. (2001) cannot be explained according to their mechanisms. Brooks (1998) reported increased transport of metal to the shoots by hyperaccumulator plant species that devel-oped tolerance to high metal concentrations. Additional studies are needed on mycorrhiza hyperaccumulators as a mechanism of protection against heavy metals in the soil.
The protective effect of mycorrhiza against plant Zn uptake has been 
observed (Li and Christie, 2001). This correlates with changes in Zn solubility due to changes in soil solution pH or by immobilization of Zn in extraradical mycelium. Cairney and Meharg (1999) reported that the diversity of ECM fungi and infections could be maintained in multiple contaminated sites. In this way, fungus provides protection to a plant against contaminants and assists the plant to grow in hazardous areas. During sand culture, Glomus 
caledonium  shows the highest infection rates and the poorest sporulating 
ability in heavy metal (Cu and Cd) treatments (Liao et al., 2003).
12.7.2 Mechanisms of Response to Metals
The mechanisms of the mycorrhizal fungi against metal toxicity and host 
plants and to them are not well understood. However, several mechanisms have been postulated. Many of the principles are similar to the biosorption of other classes of fungi. The mechanisms can be divided into two categories: avoidance and sequestration. Avoidance can reduce the concentration of metal by precipitation, biosorption, and uptake or efﬂ  ux. Sequestration 
involves the formation of compounds for intracellular chelation, and so on. The binding of heavy metals on extraradical mycelium is suggested as the mechanism for the tolerance of heavy metals in ericacious mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants. Abundant production of extramatrical mycelium can UPTAKE OF TOXIC METALS 543544 MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION
provide the best protection to the host, as it provides increased capacity for 
metal retention by reducing exposure to the individual hyphae. X-ray micro-analysis has located high Zn concentrations in extramatrical hyphae in cell walls and extrahyphal polysaccharide slime (Denny and Wilkins, 1987). The same is also true in ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes (Denny and Ridge, 1995). Dense mycelium can also provide an increased supply of nutrients to the host and will infect new plant roots due to the larger biomass. In certain mycor-rhizal associations, the fungal sheath can prevent metals from reaching the root surface. In general, these fungi produce loosely packed sheaths with large interhyphal spaces. The permeability of the apoplastic pathway to solute movement of the fungal sheath can play an important role in determining fungus-mediated host metal tolerance. The high metal storage capacity of Xerocomus badius–Picea abies  in acidic soil is related to both the activity of 
the hyphal sheath and the frequent occurrence of vacuoles (Kottke et al., 1998).
In ECM fungi, polyphosphates are produced in the vacuole that exist in 
the form of insoluble granules complexed with a variety of cations. Poly-phosphate granules bind the metal cations, and this appears to be a method of intracellular metal detoxiﬁ  cation in these fungi. Electron spectroscopic 
imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy reveal two types of electron-opaque granules detected in vacuoles of Harting net hyphae in Paxillus 
involutus-Pinus sylvestris  mycorrhizas of heavily polluted sites (Turnau et 
al., 1993, 1996). One type of granule detects high concentrations of P with S, Ca, and Al, and the other type, low concentration of P with more N, S, and Cd. Polyphosphate granules are localized inside the cytoplasm of the fungal mantle and Hartig net and contain P and Ca (Grellier et al., 1989; Moore et al., 1989). The ability of Paxillus involutus  t o  a cc um ul a t e  Cd  in  
different compartments has been recognized (Blaudez et al., 2000). Two mechanisms of metal detoxiﬁ  cation can be considered: binding of Cd onto 
cell walls and accumulation of Cd in the vacuolar compartment. Oidioden-
dron maius  Cd 8- Vaccinium myrtillus  mycorrhizas of polluted soils display 
the formation of insoluble Zn crystals (Martino et al., 2003). Isolates of O. 
maius  produce citric, malic, and fumaric acids that solubilize the insoluble 
Zn compounds. Strains isolated from unpolluted soils are more efﬁ  cient in 
solubilization from both ZnO and Zn
3(PO 4)2 than strains from polluted 
soils. Increased tolerance to arsenate has been found for Hymenoscyphus 
ericae  collected from polluted soils (Sharples et al., 2001). Arsenic enters 
the cell via the phosphate transporter. A higher tolerance of Zn and Cd of Suillus luteus  isolates from a polluted habitat is expressed in vitro than of 
isolates from an unpolluted habitat (Colpaert et al., 2000). Nearly 70 to 90% of ERM fungi solubilize Cd and Cu phosphates and cuprite (Fomina et al., 2005). Also, toxic metal minerals are better solubilized by metal-tolerant isolates.
Other metal chelators are found in the vacuoles of fungi: inorganic ions, 
phytochelatins, metallothioneins, and organic acids. Chelators may vary from ECM species to species and nutrient status of the fungus. Different metals 
also have varying afﬁ  nities for chelators. Zn and Al show higher afﬁ  nity for 
organic acids and Cu and Cd for phytochelatins. Metallothionein-like pep-tides are induced in Pisolithus tinctorius  in the presence of Cu, Cd, and Zn 
(Morselt et al., 1986). Cd exposure leads to increased activity of adenosine 3′-phosphate 5 ′-phosphosulfate sulfotransferase, sulfate reduction, and acid-
soluble thiols in Laccaria laccata  in symbiosis with Picea abies  (Galli et al., 
1993). Forming complexes with glutathione and γ-glutamylcysteine detoxiﬁ  es 
Cd. Polyamine formation in response to metals is also known. Exposure of Cu to ECM fungi propels an increase in activity of extra- and intracellular tyrosinase (Gruhn and Miller, 1991). The activity of tyrosinase enhances melanin, which limits the entry of Cu and other ions into the cells. On the contrary, little polyamine formation is noticed in Paxillus involutus  due to 
Zn exposure (Zarb and Walters, 1995). Metallothioneins and phytochelatins are involved in constitutive tolerance (Meharg, 1994). The plasmalemma of ECM fungi also appears to protect the host plant from metal toxicity. Metallo-thioneins are isolated and characterized from the ECM fungi L. laccata  and 
Paxillus involutus  (Howe et al., 1997). Some open reading frames encoding 
for putative metallothioneins have been identiﬁ  ed on the chromosomes of the 
VAM fungus Gigaspora margarita  (Lanfranco et al., 2002) and the ECM 
fungus Tuber borchii  (Pierleoni et al., 2004).
VAM fungi have also been recognized on hosts colonizing metal-
contaminated soils (Meharg and Cairney, 2000b). It appears that VAM fungi have evolved resistance to act as the nutrient supply or provide increased resistance to host plants. VAM fungi from arsenic mine spoils also contribute to plant tolerance (Gonzalez-Chavez, 2000). This study indicated an increase in the arsenate resistance of the arsenate-resistant grass Holcus lanatus .
12.7.3 Transport of Radionuclides
Fungi can determine the fate and transport processes of radionuclides in 
forests (Steiner et al., 2002). They play an important role in uptake, mobiliza-tion, and translocation of radionuclides and are responsible for the long-term retention of radiocesium in organic horizons of forest soil. Due to limited knowledge on mechanisms and processes, an attractive approach utilizing transfer factors and concentration ratios is employed to quantify the transfer of radionuclides from soil to fungal fruiting bodies. Transfer factors are expressed as parameters of contamination of fungal fruiting bodies divided by parameters of soil contamination. Different deﬁ  nitions of transfer factors 
have been developed for the radioecological models with different purposes. Transfer factors measure the availability of uptake of radionuclides directly and reﬂ  ect the appropriate physicochemical and biological processes. Trans-
fer factors for radiocesium and stable cesium for three fungal species and Vaccinium myrtillus  in a seminatural coniferous forest have been calculated 
(Ruhm et al., 1999). The relationship between radiocesium and stable cesium UPTAKE OF TOXIC METALS 545546 MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION
in mushrooms from forest ecosystems with different contamination levels has 
been summarized (Yoshida et al., 2000).
A few processes related to the persistence of radiocesium in the upper 
layers of forest soil have been identiﬁ  ed. Fungal activity in the forest soil can 
be considered in the context of predictive modeling. Quantitative prediction of radiocesium concentrations in different horizons can be conducted using compartment models (Ruhm et al., 1996; Schell et al., 1996). The applicability of compartment models for simulating the transport of radionuclides in soil has been discussed (Kirchner, 1998). A three-phase model to quantify radiocesium migration in soils of coniferous forest has been proposed (Rafferty et al., 2000).
Organic horizons of soil in forest ecosystem contain a major contamination 
of radiocesium from Chernobyl fallout (Rafferty et al., 1997; Linkov and Schell, 1999). Radiocesium is still accumulated in surface layers in Japanese forests 50 years after the global fallout (Yoshida and Muramatsu, 1994). About 22% of 
137Cs bound by fungal mycelia is estimated to be in the top 
5 cm of a coniferous forest (Fawaris and Johanson, 1995). A major fraction of 
137Cs in a Swedish forest seems to be associated with the fungal component 
(Nikolova et al., 2000). Only 0.03% of the total 137Cs is found in the mycelium 
of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the peat soil (Vinichuk et al., 2004). The value is higher for the nonpeat soil. Horizontal transport of radiocesium is known in Scandinavian forests in the form of local enrichment by fungal clusters (Nikolova et al., 1997). Autoradiography followed by image analysis reveals the translocation of radiocesium by bulk ﬂ  ow in actively expanding mycelia 
of Schizophyllum commune  in  mi cr ocos ms  an d  b y  diffus i o n  in  es ta b lis h ed  
mycelia under laboratory conditions (Gray et al., 1995).
Plants inoculated with a speciﬁ  c mycorrhizal fungus have increased their 
ability to obtain necessary nutrients while removing large quantities of 
137Cs 
and 90Sr from contaminated soils (Rogers and Williams, 1986; Entry et al., 
1994). However, the mycorrhizal heather Calluna vulgaris  accumulates less 
137Cs in liquid medium than do nonmycorrhizal plants (Clint and Dighton, 
1992). Three grass species inoculated with Glomus mosseae  or G. intraradi-
ces remove 26 to 72% of 137Cs and 24 to 89% of 90Sr from contaminated soil 
(Entry et al., 1999). Grasses inoculated with these fungi exhibit higher aboveground plant biomass, higher concentration of 
137Cs and 90Sr in plant 
tissue, percentage accumulation of 137Cs and 90Sr from soil, and plant biocon-
centration ratios at each harvest. Inoculation of grasses with VAM fungi offers a feasible, low-cost strategy to remediate and reclaim some sites con-taminated with radionuclides. Hebeloma crustuliniforme reduces the concen-
trations of 
134Cs in Picea abies  seedlings from solutions of CsCl and KH 2PO 4
with different Cs/K ratios (Brunner et al., 1996). VAM fungi related to heavy 
metal uptake and radionuclides from soil have also been discussed (Haselwandter et al., 1994). The heavy metals and lanthanides concentrations in sporocarps of U.S. ectomycorrhizal fungi and factors affecting metal uptake in ectomycorrhizal fungi have been documented (Aruguete et al., 1998).12.7.4 Genetics of Metal Tolerance
No studies have been conducted on the genetics and molecular biology of 
ECM fungal adaptation to contaminated soils in the ﬁ  elds. Such studies are 
needed to investigate the mechanisms of ECM metal tolerance. Such studies may include the screening of sensitive and insensitive genotypes from mine and wild-type ECM fungal populations. Segregation of metal-sensitive and metal-insensitive isolates on metal-contaminated soils can lead to isolation of adaptive metal-tolerant species. Physiological studies of metal-tolerant species can reveal the mechanism of metal adaptation. Tomsett (1993) described some aspects of genetics and molecular biology of metal tolerance in fungi. Isolates of Pisolithus tinctorius  from a contaminated acid coal mine site show 
varied tolerance to Al, with EC
50 values from 0.2 to 74 mM, compared to 0.04 
to 0.07 mM Al tolerance for wild-type isolates from a contaminated site (Egerton-Warburton and Grifﬁ  n, 1995). The genetic variation in the popula-
tion of Suillus luteus  is larger than at the polluted site (Colpaert et al., 2000). 
The 12 Oidiodendron maius  isolates from the polluted soils were grouped in 
different genetic clusters by Lacourt et al. (2000).
Glomalin, an insoluble glycoprotein produced by VAM fungi can sequester 
potentially toxic elements such as Cu, Cd, Pb, and Mn (Gonzalez-Chavez et al., 2004). Glomalin extracted from polluted soils contained Cu, Cd, and Pb. Glomalin from hyphae of an isolate of Gigaspora rosea  sequestered up to 
28 mg Cu/g in vitro. Glomalin can act as a biostabilizer for the remediation of polluted soils.
12.8 PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON DEGRADATION
Crude oil spills are global problems and cause severe damage if released into 
the environment. The toxic effects of crude oil on plants are established, but little is known on the oil degradation by mycorrhizal fungi. Miller et al. (1978) described a signiﬁ  cant reduction in the infectivity of ECM and its biomass in 
the aerobic microﬂ  ora of Arctic tundra, and the resistance to oil is noted in 
certain fungi. Rajapakse and Miller (1991) discussed methods for the evalu-ation of ectomycorrrhizal tips and VAM colonization in poplar roots. The petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading capabilities of mycorrhizal fungi are limited and are noted in Table 12.2.
ECM fungi exhibit extensive colonization of spruce plants sown at the time 
of contamination, and most spruce root tips (90%) are mycorrhizal (Nicolotti and Egli, 1998). Six morphotypes have been identiﬁ  ed and their macroscopic 
and microscopic features noted. Type E displays the best colonization, match-ing exactly the growth pattern of three species of Laccaria  in pure culture 
and morphological characteristics, suggesting that type E may belong to this genus. VAM fungi occur in both petroleum-polluted and nonpolluted soils (Cabello, 1997). Nonpolluted soils display higher percentages of colonization PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON DEGRADATION 547TABLE 12.2 Petroleum Hydrocarbon-Degrading Capabilities of Mycorrhizal Fungi

548in plants than do polluted soils. The proportion of arbuscles to vesicles and 
number of entry points are higher in plants grown in uncontaminated soils. The vesicles show signs of degeneration due to the utilization of lipid reserves by the fungus. The highest propagule densities per 100 g of dry soil to colonize roots are found in uncontaminated soils. V AM infective propagules from contaminated soils display the high colonization capacity. The VAM fungal species Glomus aggregatum  and G. mosseae  have been identiﬁ  ed from both 
contaminated and uncontaminated soils.
Several reports have documented an inﬂ  uence on ECM symbiosis by 
anthropogenic pollution from different industrial and/or urban sources; however, it is difﬁ  cult to correlate such results. Cairney and Meharg (1999) 
discussed the inﬂ  uence of important forms of anthropogenic pollution on the 
morphology and dynamics of mycorrhizal fungal communities. Change in infection levels and diversity in ECM morphotype have been reported as an outcome of these studies. Knowledge of changes in mycelial systems by such pollution will provide an understanding of the sustainability of mycorrhizal systems. A range of soil pollutant parameters present in industrial and/or urban sources have been measured (Markkola et al., 1995; Kieliszewska-Rokicka et al., 1997).
It is evident that the long-term environmental consequences of oil spills in 
agricultural and forest areas are not of much immensity compared with coastal ecosystems. This may be due to the presence of fungi and bacteria in the soil that can catalyze the process of bioremediation. Certain ectomycorrhizal fungi can survive in these contaminated soils, where these can utilize crude oil as a nutrient and contribute their share in the process of mycoremediation. Mycorrhizal fungi can also establish degradative consortia in the root zone. An example of such a mycorrhizal system results in the formation of a par-enchymatous patch on hydrocarbon-contaminated soil supporting a hydro-carbon-degrading bacterial bioﬁ  lm (Sarand et al., 1998). When inoculated 
with a strain of Pseudomonas ﬂ  uorescens  containing a toluene-degrading 
plasmid, the same rhizosphere association reveals the degradation of meta -
toluate (Sarand et al., 1999). Besides, more knowledge is required on the contribution of mycorrhizal fungi in petroleum hydrocarbons, tolerance limits, role of nutrients, host growth and survival, and the various infective propagules in the soils.
12.9 LIGNIN AND PHENOLIC DEGRADATION
Phenolics are rich in the soils of healthland and temperate-forest ecosystems. 
Plants associating with ECM and ERM fungi inhabit soils containing pheno-lic compounds. Two broad categories are known for these compounds: lignin and soluble phenolics, including phenolic acids and polyphenols (e.g., tannins, quinones, and humic and fulvic acids). Polyphenols can bind with a range of LIGNIN AND PHENOLIC DEGRADATION 549550 MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION
organic nitrogen compounds, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and chitin, result-
ing in the formation of complexes.
A limited number of ECM and ERM fungi have shown the ability to 
degrade lignin and soluble phenolics (Table 12.3). Lignin and phenolics can b e  d e g r a d e d  i n  a x e n i c  c u l t u r e s .  I n  p u r e  c u l t u r e s ,  ﬁ  ve different species of 
ECM fungi show their ability to metabolize 
14C-labeled plant lignin, 
[14C]lignocellulose, and [14C]DHP–lignin at a rate lower than the white-
rot fungi Heterobasidion annosum  and Sporotrichum pulverulentum
(Trojanowski et al., 1984). ECM fungi exhibit relatively less degradation of [
14C](U)-holocellulose than that of white-rot fungi. Two species of ECM 
fungi decompose [14C]vanillic acid to a higher extent than Heterobasidion 
annosum . The ERM fungi are more effective in degrading [14C]lignin than 
ECM fungi in pure cultures (Haselwandter et al., 1990). The facultative ECM fungus Paxillus involutus  degrades lignin more readily than the obligate 
ECM fungi Suillus bovinus  and Rhizopogon roseolus . ERM fungi and ECM 
fungus Paxillus involutus  release more than 35% and 24% of [
14CH 3]DHP 
of coniferyl alcohol, respectively.
ERM fungi can detoxify phenolics (Bending and Read, 1996a), whereas 
ECM and ERM fungi bind tannin–protein complexes through nitrogen (Bending and Read, 1996b). The ERM fungus Hymenoscyphus ericae  readily 
metabolized all but benzoic and para -methoxybenzoic acids in axenic culture 
(Leake, 1987). Vanillic, para -coumaric, and para -hydroxybenzoic acids 
increased the mycelial yields, while ferulic, syringic, and salicylic acids and an equimolar mixture of compounds retarded it. A carbon source and con-centration showed no effect on the degradation of para -hydroxybenzoic acid 
or catechol by Armillaria ostoyae  (Entry et al., 1992). A. ostoyae  grows faster 
at high carbon concentration, but cannot more effectively degrade para -
hydroxybenzoic acid or catechol. The phenol-degrading abilities of ERM fungi are more developed than the limited abilities of ECM fungi. Phenol-oxidizing enzymes are responsible for the degradation of phenols by these fungi.
Suillus granulatus  completely metabolizes catechol, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic 
acid, and vanillic acid, which have been attributed to tyrosinase activity (Gunther et al., 1998). However, Paxillus involutus  metabolized these com-
pounds at low rates. Mycelia of S. granulatus  led to complete transformation 
of para- cresol within 5 hours. Two metabolites similar to 4-methylcatechol 
and 4-methyl- ortho -benzoquinone were produced after 1 hour. Cell-free 
culture ﬂ  uid of S. granulatus  oxidized para -cresol at a lower rate (i.e., 50% 
after 30 hours, with the formation of minor concentrations of the same two metabolites). Mycelia of P. involutus  oxidized para -cresol at a low rate without 
the formation of metabolites, and the cell-free culture ﬂ  uid showed no activ-
ity. Suillus granulatus–Pinus sylvestris  mycorrhizas indicated the disappear-
ance of para -cresol within 48 hours with the detection of same two metabolites. 
P. involutus  mycorrhizas resulted in a 10% reduction of para -cresol initial 
concentration without the detection of metabolites.TABLE 12.3 Lignin and Phenolic-Degrading Capabilities of Mycorrhizal Fungi

551552 MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION
The tannin-degrading abilities of certain mycorrhizal fungi have been 
identiﬁ  ed (Giltrap, 1982; Bending and Read, 1996a). ECM fungi are recog-
nized for lower-degrading abilities of tannic acid (Trojanowski et al., 1984; Haselwandter et al., 1990). Ericoid Hymenoscyphus ericae  shows well-devel-
oped abilities to degrade tannin (Bending and Read, 1996a). The inhibition of growth of fungi by tannic acid may be due to the inactivation of enzymes of the cell wall. Degradation of tannic acid is enhanced in the presence of assimilation of NH
4+. Protein binding capacity is reduced signiﬁ  cantly as a 
result of tannic acid degradation by H. ericae .H.ericae  induces the produc-
tion of extracellular polyphenol oxidase in the presence of tannic acid, which is not the case with ECM fungi. Addition of NH
4+ seems to enhance the syn-
thesis of phenol-oxidizing enzymes, which in turn increases both the mycelial yields and tannic acid degradation by H. ericae . This process may be acceler-
ated in certain healthland soils that contain small amounts of NH
4+.
A vermiculite culture system inoculated with fungi in the presence or 
absence of a host has also been employed for the assay of mineralization of 2,4-dichlorophenol (Meharg et al., 1997a). This is a ﬁ  rst report on the dem-
onstration of the ability of ECM fungi related to the degradation of aromatics in axenic cultures and by intact mycorrhizal associations. Higher mineraliza-tion occurs during growth of fungi in symbiosis with Pinus sylvestris  than in 
the absence of a host. Suillus variegatus  reveals a higher growth rate of phy-
tobiont, with seedlings of shoot biomass of 230 mg as compared to a P. invo-
lutus  biomass of 150 mg. Both roots and shoots exhibit the accumulation of 
label 2,4-dichlorophenol, about 40% of the total plant biomass by two fungi. Paxillus involutus  stim ula tes more e fﬁ  ciently than S. variegatus  in labeling 
2,4-dichlorophenol during vermiculite culture studies in the absence of seed-lings. The pattern of stimulation is signiﬁ  cantly different in both fungi in 
symbiotic association with the Scots pine plant. P. involutus  increases 50% 
mineralization and S. variegatus  250% in symbiotic association. Only 3% of 
2,4-dichlorophenol is mineralized after 13 days in vermiculite investigations by the most efﬁ  cient degrader. In one study, 2,4-dichlorophenol was metabo-
lized rapidly in both rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soils, and 25% of 2,4-dichlorophenol was mineralized on day 13 by all treatments (Boyle and Shann, 1995). In the ﬁ  eld, edaphic and plant factors contribute greatly to degradation 
rates. It is always important to screen the degradation rates of such com-pounds in association with the host so that the studies can be applied to ﬁ eld-scale mycoremediation.
12.10 PAH AND TNT DEGRADATION
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous and persistent envi-
ronmental pollutants. They are highly toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic and constitute a great public health concern. The contamination produced by industries contains various classes of compounds and is highly complex. The PAH AND TNT DEGRADATION 553
distribution of VAM propagules in India and reduction in diversity in coal, 
lignite, and calcite mine spoils compared to undisturbed soils have been studied (Ganesan et al., 1991). PAHs can disperse and be deposited on vege-tation and soils from a range of industrial processes. VAM colonization was shown not to be inﬂ  uenced by anthracene addition in 10 g/kg soil in leek 
(Leyval and Binet, 1998). However, the percentage of colonization in clover and leek decreased upon addition of contaminated soil of 8 g/kg total PAHs from a coal production plant. Mycorrhizal fungi capable of degrading the diverse PAHs are limited and are noted in Table 12.4.
The ability to degrade PAHs (i.e., phenanthrene, chrysene, pyrene, and 
benzo[ a] pyrene) has been tested by 16 species (27 strains) of ectomycorrhizal 
fungi (Braun-Lullemann et al., 1999). Amanita muscaria ,Paxillus involutus ,
and Suillis grevillei utilized about 50% of phenanthrene. Strains of Amanita 
excelsa ,Leccinum versipelle ,S. grevillei ,S. luteus , and S. variegatus removed 
about the same amount of benzo[ a] pyrene within 4 weeks. S. grevillei 
removed nearly 50% pyrene, while Boletus edulis  and A. muscaria  removed 
35% of chrysene. No correlation was shown to exist between the number of aromatic rings and the rate of metabolism as well as between the depletion of nitrogen and degradation. The rate of metabolism of benzo[ a]pyrene is 
slow but very efﬁ  cient, which correlates with the results obtained by white-rot 
fungi (Schutzendubel et al., 1999). The conversion rates of ﬁ  ve PAHs in liquid 
culture by 58 fungi, including ECM fungi, have been noted (Gramss et al., 1999). Only one of 21 species does not degrade at least one PAH, and over half of the species tend to degrade all ﬁ  ve PAHs. However, there is no infor-
mation on the pathways of degradation of PAHs. All ECM fungal isolates are taken from unpolluted soil samples. It appears that the oxidative enzymes responsible for the degradation of these compounds may have some role in the ecology of ECM fungi. Active oxygen has been to be important for the oxidation of aromatic compounds by ﬁ  eld-grown mats of ECM fungi (Gramss, 
1997).
All ECM fungi (i.e., Paxillus involutus , two isolates of Pisolithus tinctorius ,
Suillus variegatus , and Tylospora ﬁ  brillosa ) transform 2,4,6-trinitotoluene 
(TNT) to a lesser or greater extent after 3 days of incubation in axenic cultures (Meharg et al., 1997b). S.variegatus  produces the highest amount of biomass, 
and the rate of biotransformation is reduced under nitrogen-deﬁ  cient con-
ditions. TNT transformation capacity is higher in intact mycelium (600%) than in cultural ﬁ  ltrate containing extracellular enzymes. This may suggest 
the possibility of a number of pathways in TNT transformation by the intact mycelium. The dose–response curve for S. variegatus  biomass production 
depicts fungal sensitivity to TNT. The TNT concentration reducing S. varie-
gatus  biomass by 50% (EC
50) is between 2 and 10 μg/ml, which is considered 
within the range (12 mg/g soil dry weight) for Phanerochaete chrysosporium
(Spiker et al., 1992). This biotransformation occurs under conditions of suf-ﬁ cient carbon, which correlates very well with the requirement to have myce-
lium in symbiotic association with the plant.TABLE 12.4 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon-Degrading Capabilities of Mycorrhizal Fungi

55412.11 PCB DEGRADATION
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are used widely in industry, due to insulat-
ing properties and resistance to burning. A large amount of PCB has been released into the environment due to improper industrial practices. ECM fungi are one of the biological agents that may be employed to solve this problem. The potential for survival of ectomycorrhizal fungi and colonization of plant roots at the contaminated sites has stimulated research on their application in PCB degradation. Fungi–plant symbiotic associations have a greater potential than bacteria and saprophytic fungi to survive at PCB-contaminated sites.
ECM fungi show degradation of 14 of 21 PCBs (Donnelly and Fletcher, 
1995). At least 14 fungi metabolize 20% of PCBs. The number and relative amounts of PCB congener metabolized by fungi range from 0 to 7 of 19. Lower chlorinated congeners degrade more rapidly than higher chlorinated congeners. The average recovery is 78% based on the species and congener. Gautieria crispa  and Radiigera atrogleba  metabolize the highest number of 
congeners: ﬁ  ve and seven, respectively. Radiigera atrogleba  almost metabo-
lizes two congeners and 60 to 79% of one congener, and Hysterangium gard-
neri de gra des 80% o f tw o co ng e n e rs. PCBs ar e be tte r de gra ded b y Suillus 
granulatus  than by Hymenoscyphus ericae .
Organoﬂ  uorine compounds, some of which are agrochemicals, are highly 
toxic and accumulate in the environment, due to their persistent nature. Tylospora ﬁ  brillosa  and other species degraded 4-ﬂ  uorobiphenyl (4-FBP) in 
batch cultures in a study by Green et al. (1999b). Four major biotransforma-tion products were detected by 
14HPLC proﬁ  les, and six major ﬂ  uorine-
containing products were recognized by 19F-NMR spectroscopy. Two major 
products, 4-ﬂ  uorobiphen-4 ′-ol and 4-ﬂ  uorobiphen-3 ′-ol, were conﬁ  rmed and 
there was no concrete evidence of identiﬁ  cation of other products. Based 
on19F-NMR spectroscopy and 14HPLC proﬁ  les, 4-FBP was degraded by
Thelephora terrestris  (>65% biotransformation products), Suillus variegatus
(>50%), and Hymenoscyphus ericae  (>20%), respectively. The transforma-
tion products formed were identical to those revealed by T. ﬁ brillosa . More 
than 85% of 4-FBP was degraded during incubation with T. ﬁ brillosa  and 
other mycorrhizal fungi. However, 4-FBP was not biotransformed by Suillus
granulatus . These results show the involvement of monoxygenation in the 
biotransformation. The occurrence of sequential hydroxylation in the mycor-rhizal fungi was also determined. This was the ﬁ  rst detailed and important 
study on the elucidation of knowledge on the mechanism of action describing intermediary products during degradation by mycorrhizal fungi.
12.12 HERBICIDE DEGRADATION
The potential of metabolizing herbicides by ECM fungi has been recognized 
to a certain extent. Several ECM fungi (i.e., Hebeloma cylindrosporum ,HERBICIDE DEGRADATION 555556 MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION
Suillus bellini , and S. variegatus ) display the highest degradation of chlor-
propham in the culture medium (Rouillon et al., 1989). About half of the cultures reveal the detection of 3-chloroaniline, an intermediate product after 1 week of incubation. Many ECM fungi have shown the ability to degrade two chlorinated herbicides, atrazine and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (Donnelly et al., 1993; Donnelly and Fletcher, 1994). Among the mycor-rhizal fungi, Rhizopogon vinicolor  revealed the maximum degradation of 
1.0 mM 2,4-D alone when supplemented with 1 mM nitrogen concentration. The ERM fungus H. ericae  showed the highest level of carbon into the tissue 
due to atrazine. In general, an increase in herbicide degradation correlated wi t h  an  in c r e a s e  in  ni t r o g e n  c o n c e n t r a t i o n .  In  m o s t  in s t an c e s ,  d e gr a d a t i o n  occurred by incorporation of herbicide carbon into tissue, not by mineraliza-tion. The degradation of side chains may have occurred but was not detected. 
14C-(ring)-labeled atrazine is not mineralized by soil fungi, but the fungal 
cells show 25% atrazine (Wolf and Martin, 1975). The biotransformation of 1-naphthalene acetic acid by Pisolithus arhizus (tinctorius ) leads to the forma-
tion of two major products, 1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1-acetic acid γ-lactone and 4-hydroxy-1-naphthalene acetic acid (Soledade et al., 1994). 
A pesticide mecoprop, 2-(2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid, is well degraded by a complex consortia of microbes in the rhizosphere (Lappin et al., 1985).
12.13 COMPARISON OF MYCORRHIZAL AND 
WHITE-ROT FUNGI
White-rot fungi produce extracellular oxidative lignin- and humic acid–
degrading enzymes, which have contributed to the development of their use in mycoremediation. The best studied enzymes are LiP, MnP, and laccase. Extracellular release of lignin enzymes plays an important role in the myco-remediation of soils. These enzymes can diffuse to soil surfaces, where the persistent organic compounds tend to bind, thus increasing the bioavailability of these compounds. One signiﬁ  cant advantage lies in the fact that contact 
between hyphae or mycelia of white-rot fungi and organic compounds is not necessarily required, which leads to degradation without toxicity. Extracel-lular enzymatic reactions reduce soil toxicity so that white-rot fungi can toler-ate high concentrations of these constituents. The tolerance of certain white-rot fungi to cyanide concentrations is 100 times greater than other soil organisms, leading to mineralization via ligninolytic enzymes (Barr and Aust, 1994).
Several researchers have tried to compare mycorrhizal and white-rot fungi. 
The degradation of aromatic compounds depends on the fungus, substrate, and physiological conditions. A number of mycorrhizal fungi have been shown to degrade aromatic xenobiotics in batch experiments, including the pesticides atrazine and 2,4-D and the lower chlorinated PCBs. In this way, these are similar to white-rot fungi in the degradation of a wide range of 
aromatic xenobiotics, whereas mycorrhizal fungi depend on the host plant for carbon. Cairney and Burke (1994) reported the production of certain enzyme-degrading components of plant cell walls by mycorrhizal fungi. Some mycor-rhizal fungi are known to induce ligninolytic enzymes in vitro (Grifﬁ  ths and 
Caldwell, 1992). The degradative ability of PCBs by mycorrhizal fungi is equaled or exceeded by that of the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chryso-
sporium  (Donnelly and Fletcher, 1995). In some studies, mycorrhizal fungi 
and Phanerochaete chrysosporium  r e v ealed n one or enhanced de grada ti on 
of aromatic xenobiotics due to increased carbon and/or nitrogen addition (Donnelly et al., 1993; Yadav et al., 1995). Low nitrogen and carbon additions favor the production of ligninolytic (Grifﬁ  ths and Caldwell, 1992) and plant 
cell wall–degrading fungal enzymes (Cairney and Burke, 1994). However, Meharg et al. (1997a) reported degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol by Suillus 
variegatus  and Paxillus involutus  under increased carbon concentration in 
culture experiments and during symbiosis with the host plant. However, the mycorrhizal fungi show more rapid mineralization in symbiosis with the host plant than that of mycelium in batch experiments. This implies that lignino-lytic enzymes are not a requirement for the initial steps in degradation by mycorrhizal fungi. A wide range of bacteria and fungi have been shown to degrade TNT. It is evident that the mechanism of initial steps is more or less similar throughout these organisms. This entails the formation of hydroxyl-aminodinitrotoluenes by reduction of one of the nitro groups on the aryl ring and the formation of aminodinitrotoluenes by further reduction (Higson, 1992; Gorontzy et al., 1994). It has been concluded that plasmalemma redox potential causes reduction of TNT by Phanerochaete chrysosporium  (Stahl 
and Aust, 1993). Intact cells of Suillus variegatus  showed more efﬁ  ciency in 
biotransformation than the possible reduction of TNT by the cultural ﬁ  ltrate 
(Meharg et al., 1997b). The mycorrhizal and wood-rotting fungi produced extracellular enzymes that can be related to the degradation of certain con-stituents. The results also indicate ring ﬁ  ssion and the ultimate production of 
carbon dioxide in the pathways of biotransformation for both mycorrhizal and white-rot fungi (Vyas et al., 1994; Yadav et al., 1995; Dietrich et al., 1995).
Mycorrhizal and wood-rotting fungi differ in ecological functions in diverse 
ecosystems. Wood-rotting fungi are wood-decomposing saprophytic fungi growing on dead organic matter, and mycorrhizal fungi are symbiotic associa-tions of plant roots. The degradation of lignin and cellulose by white-rot fungi and to a certain extent by brown-rot fungi is now well established. Bending and Read (1997) reported on the low abilities to degrade lignin and phenolics by mycorrhizal fungi relative to wood-rotting fungi, together with the ecologi-cal signiﬁ  cance of the results. Degradation of lignin and phenolics by mycor-
rhizal fungi has implications for its nutrition and that of the host plant. Several reports suggest the production of peroxidase enzyme activities by ECM and ERM fungi during axenic cultures, but no evidence has been shown; however, COMPARISON OF MYCORRHIZAL AND WHITE-ROT FUNGI 557558 MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RHIZOSPHERE REMEDIATION
peroxidase activities may be established under certain conditions in the 
future.
12.14 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Mycorrhizas constitute a bridge for nutrient transport from soils to plant 
roots. Their role in the formation of soil aggregates and the protection of host plants against drought and root pathogens is well established. A slow process of remediation by these fungi is predicted, which depends on the development of the host root system and associated fungal biomass. The selection of com-patible host–fungus–substrate combinations can be exploited by inoculating with ECM or ERM fungi for sustaining the infections. A survival rate of years is w ell kno wn when inoculated e xperimen tally with ECM fungi (Selosse et al., 1999). Multitrophic interactions are useful in rapid remediations. Fast remediation of persistent organic compounds may be possible with interaction between ECM fungi or bacteria.
High variability and lack of homogeneity in experimental protocols, bioas-
says, and ﬁ  eld data are quite familiar in mycorrhizal research. Variability in 
concentration, duration, and exposure of constituent, coupled with soil and edaphic features, multiple constituents, short-lived/long-lived infections, and colonization and greenhouse/natural conditions will greatly affect the genera-tion of data. Such inconsistencies make interpretations and conclusions more difﬁ cult. A fungus growing continuously in the ﬁ  eld indicates an ample supply 
of carbon coming from the host plant. This can lead to the development of certain enzyme activities and a fungal biomass that aids in the degradation of to xic compounds. Experiments should be designed so as to decipher the intricate fungal degradations in the ﬁ  eld in symbiotic association with the host 
plant as to how the inﬂ  uence of environmental factors on degradation and 
the degradation rate are affected.
Due to prevailing mycorrhizal fungal diversity in ecosystems, it is difﬁ  cult 
to predict the effect of soil acidiﬁ  cation, metal or hydrocarbon pollution, and 
other factors on mycorrhizal communities. Because of this effect, the loss of fungal species may occur in soils, resulting in increased predisposition of the host plant to environmental stress. Current knowledge on the functional diversity of mycorrhizal communities is fragmentary. Therefore, the ultimate interest shifts back to the effects of pollutants on the extramatrical mycelial systems of these fungi in soil. This can result in reduction or gain of fungal biomass in soil. Study of the effects of pollutants on the growth of extramatri-cal mycelium of these fungi is the ﬁ  rst step in understanding the stability or 
sustainability in the ecosystems. This knowledge on the behavior of such fungi in association with the host plant can be deciphered collectively. Ultrastruc-tural details related to soil acidiﬁ  cation and contamination, nutrient transfer, 
and structural alterations can answer questions of general ecological impor-tance. Trees can be planted on soils low in contamination where there is no risk of human health. Trees can be inoculed with the suitable fungi. This may REFERENCES 559
result in gradual decontamination after the establishment of mycorrhizal 
fungi in the soil. Important gaps exist in understanding multitrophic interac-tions, and such complexity is far greater than described.
Little work has been performed on screening of these fungi related to 
persistent organic compounds, and comprehensive screening is required. Mineralization of certain compounds has been demonstrated in certain cases, and the intermediate products are known in only a few cases. Production of extracellular enzymes by mycorrhizal fungi is now known and has a great potential in soil mycoremediation. Unfortunately, no example is known that elucidates the mechanism of action of mycotransformation of any pollutant. It is necessary to identify matching host plant species, and efforts need to be intensiﬁ  ed to perform large-scale greenhouse ﬁ  eld trials to update the process. 
Soil characteristics related to contaminants, fungal mycelia, host plants, and the efﬁ  ciency of the process of mycoremediation need to be optimized. Tree 
growth and its management, including fertilization and irrigation, will also be important in the future of rhizosphere mycoremediation (Meharg and Cairney, 2000a).
VAM fungi can express anastomosis formation and nuclear and protoplas-
mic exchange. Genetic exchange during anastomosis formation can open the door to vegetative compatability in natural populations of V AM fungi. Somatic incompatibility (Dahlberg, 1999) and genetic transformation in ECM fungi (Lemke et al., 1999) have been described. Success can be obtained by cloning transport system genes in plants by complementation of yeast mutants (D’Enfert et al., 1995). This will assist in our understanding of the molecular aspects of transport systems in ectomycorrhizal fungi and ectomycorrhizas. Transport-system-speciﬁ  c antibody development against protein sequences 
derived from cDNAs or against puriﬁ  ed transport proteins can be helpful in 
this regard (Chalot and Brun, 1998).
Genetic transformation system is highly complex, due to the symbiotic 
nature of these fungi. However, it is now possible to design molecular tech-niques to characterize signals, genes, and proteins necessary for symbiosis. Only then can the involvement of these molecules and signals in the ectomy-corrhizal process be demonstrated functionally. Genetically engineered mycorrhizal fungi can be developed and applied for the manipulation of host plants in many physiological and ecological ways. Such novel fungi can express metal-chelating factors for the reduced uptake of soluble metals by roots. In addition, an adverse environment around root systems due to acidity or toxic pollutants can be changed.
