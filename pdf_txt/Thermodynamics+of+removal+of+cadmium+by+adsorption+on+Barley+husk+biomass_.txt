ABSTRACT 
 
The adsorption ability of barley husk biomass for r emoving Cd (II) has been studied using cold vapour atomic 
absorption spectrometry. A dose of 3 g/L of dried b iomass in a solution with an initial pH of 7, an in itial Cd(II) 
concentration of 10 mg/L and a contact time of 90 m in resulted in the maximum Cd(II) removal efficienc y (95.9%). 
The effect of temperature on cadmium sorption on ba rley husk was thoroughly examined. Consistent with an 
exothermic reaction, an increase in the temperature  resulted in decreasing Cd (II) adsorption rate. Th ermodynamic 
parameters (i.e., change in the free energy ( ∆Go), the enthalpy ( ∆Ho), and the entropy ( ∆So)) were also evaluated. 
The overall adsorption process was exothermic and s pontaneous in nature.  These results suggest that barley husk 
could be employed as an efficient adsorbent for the  removal of cadmium from contaminated water sources.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Recovery of pollutants from waste water and industr ial waste has become a very important environmental  issue[1,2].  
The presence of heavy metals contaminated in aqueou s streams, arising from the discharge of untreated metal 
containing effluent into water bodies[3,4]. They ar e non-degradable in the environment and can be harm ful to a 
variety of living species[5,6]. Besides the toxic a nd harmful effects to organisms living in water, he avy metals also 
accumulate throughout the food chain and may affect  human beings[7,8]. For that reason, the removal of  these 
metals from waters and wastewaters is important in terms of protection of public health and environmen t[9,10].  
 
Cadmium is one of the most toxic heavy metals, it h as been reported to cause renal dysfunction, hypert ension, lung 
insufficiency, bone lesions, cancer, etc[11,12]. Th e drinking water guideline value recommended for th is element by 
the WHO and American Water Works Association (AWWA)  is 0.005 mg/L[13]. The principal industrial source s of 
Cd in the environment are electroplating, smelting,  alloy manufacturing, pigments, plastic, battery, m ining and 
refining processes[14-16]. 
 
Treatment processes for metal contaminated waste st reams include chemical precipitation, membrane filt ration, ion 
exchange, carbon adsorption, and co-precipitation/a dsorption[17,18]. Among these, adsorption process h as been 
found as one of the most promising technologies in water pollution control in terms of cost, simplicit y of design and 
operation[19,20]. Activated carbon has undoubtedly been the most popular and widely used adsorbent in wastewater Hossein Azarpira et al Der Pharma Chemica, 2016, 8 (10):243-247

244 treatment applications throughout the world and has  been successfully utilized for the removal of dive rse types of 
pollutants including metal ions[21,22]. However, th e high capital and regeneration cost of the activat ed carbon 
limits its large-scale applications for the removal  of metals and other aquatic pollutants, which have  encouraged 
researchers to look for low-cost alternative[23,24] .  
 
The barley husk is one agricultural residue which c an be used as low-cost adsorbent[25]. Recently, the  residues of 
barley husk are going to be greater and more availa ble due to increase the tendency to consume the veg etable oils in 
Iran and the entire world[26, 27]. The residues of barley husk have been used as adsorbent in several studies and 
have been indicated the acceptable results to remov e the pollutants[28, 29]. The objective of the pres ent work is to 
investigate the biosorption potential of barley hus k biomass in the removal of Cd(II) ions from aqueou s solution. 
Optimum biosorption conditions were determined as a  function of initial Cd(II) concentration, contact time, and 
temperature.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
In this study, the Barley husk was used as low cost  natural or agricultural wastes for Cd (II)  removal from aqueous 
solutions. The stalks of Barley husk (C) were colle cted from research farm of Tabriz agricultural scho ol. The stalks 
were washed several times with water to remove the contaminant, dried in the oven at 105 ℃	for 5 h. The biomass 
were then treated with 0.5 M H 2SO 4 for 3 h followed by the washing with distilled wat er and then was oven dried at 
105 ℃	for 5 h. After drying, adsorbent were sieved to obt ain particle size of 18 mesh prior to being used fo r 
adsorption studies. 
 
Chemicals and reagents 
All of the chemicals and reagents were at least of analytical grade and used without further purificat ions. The Cd (II)  
ion stock solutions with a concentration of 1000 mg /L were prepared 
 
from their corresponding nitrate salts. The metal i on solutions were subsequently diluted with deioniz ed water to 
obtain desired concentration ranging from 10 to 100  mg/L. All the tested plastic bottles and glassware s were 
presoaked in a 20% HNO 3 solution for 3 days, rinsed with deionized water an d oven-dried before each experiments. 
 
Batch adsorption experiments 
Batch adsorption experiments were carried out by ag itating 0.3 g of the adsorbent with 100 ml aqueous solution of 
cadmium at temperature 30 ℃ in different polythene bottles on a shaking thermo stat at 180 rpm. After 
predetermined time intervals, the adsorbent was sep arated from solutions by a 0.45 m cellulose acetate membrane 
without centrifugation. The filtrate was then analy zed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Shim adzu AA 
6300) that is equipped with both flare combustion a nd graphite furnace spectrophotometer, which were e mployed 
respectively according to different concentrations.  Influence of pH on adsorption was also examined by  adjusting 
initial solution pH using 0.1 M nitric acid and sod ium hydroxide solutions. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The contact time between adsorbate and adsorbent is  the most important design parameter that affects t he 
performance of adsorption processes. The adsorption  capacity and %removal of Barley husk versus the co ntact time 
is shown in Fig. 1 and 2. The figure revealed that the adsorption capacity increased with the contact time up to 90 
min when the maximum adsorption is reached. Therefo re the optimum contact time was chosen as 90 min. 
 
Figures 1 and 2 show the effect of Cd (II)  concentration on the adsorption of Cd (II)  by Barley husk.  The data 
shows that the Cd (II)   uptake increases and the percentage adsorption  of  Cd (II)  decreases with increase in metal 
ion concentration. This increase (3.19- 22.98 mg/g)  is a result of increase in the driving force, i.e.  concentration 
gradient. However, the percentage adsorptions of Cd (II)  on Barley husk were decreased from 95.9 to 68.96%. 
Though an increase in  metal uptake was observed, t he decrease in percentage adsorption may be attribu ted to lack 
of sufficient surface area to accommodate much more  metal available in the solution[30,31]. The percen tage  
adsorption at higher concentration levels shows a d ecreasing trend whereas the equilibrium uptake of C d (II)  
displays an opposite trend. At lower concentrations , all Cd (II)  present in solution could interact with the binding  
sites and thus  the percentage adsorption was highe r than those at higher Cd(II)  concentrations[32,33]. At higher Hossein Azarpira et al Der Pharma Chemica, 2016, 8 (10):243-247

245 concentrations, lower adsorption yield is due to th e saturation of adsorption sites. As a result, the purification yield 
can be increased by diluting the wastewaters contai ning high Cd(II)  concentrations[34,35]. 
 
Effect of temperature on the removal 
Temperature is an important parameter and has prono unced effect on adsorption. During the present inve stigations 
the removal of cadmium decreased from 95.9.% to 69. 4% by increasing the temperature from 283 to 328 K (Fig. 1) 
at an initial cadmium concentration of 10 mg/L. The  higher ionic strength helps eliminating the effect s of change in 
concentration during the process of removal. The ex periments were conducted at 6.5 pH and agitation sp eed was 
maintained at 180 rpm. It is clear that like most a dsorption processes, removal of cadmium is also an exothermic 
reaction. It is also clear from this figure that eq uilibrium was established in 90 min. This variation  in removal of 
cadmium seems due to the enhancement of relative es caping tendencies of the metal ions from aqueous ph ase to the 
bulk and consequent reduction in the boundary layer  thickness[36,37]. The decrease in the removal at i ncreasing 
temperatures can also be attributed to the increase d solubility of metal at relatively higher temperat ures[38,39]. 
 
The other thermodynamic parameters of concern are c hange in standard free energy, ∆G◦, change in standard 
enthalpy, ∆H◦, and the change in standard entropy, ∆S◦. Values of these parameters were calculated at 283 , 298, 
313, and 328 ◦C respectively. For the present investigations, val ues of these parameters were determined using 
following standard equations[40-42]: 
 
∆G◦ =−RT lnK 
∆H◦ = R(T 2T1/(T 2-T1) ln K 2/K1 
∆S◦ = ∆H◦ − ∆G◦/T 
 
where ‘R’ is gas constant (8.314 J mol −1K−1), K, K 1, and K 2 are equilibrium constants at temperatures T, T 1, and T 2, 
respectively. ‘K’ is related to Langmuir’s constant . The values of ∆G◦, ∆H◦ and ∆S◦ calculated for the present 
studies have been given in Table 1 and shows that t he values of all the parameters are negative and fu rther confirm 
exothermic nature of the process of cadmium removal . Under different temperatures (283, 298, and 313 a nd 328 K), 
the negative ∆G◦  values of 6.975, 7.144, 7.396 and 7.672 Jmol −1 indicated the spontaneous nature of Cd (II)  
adsorption by barley husk. The magnitude of ∆G◦ increased along with increasing temperature, imply ing an 
increased degree of spontaneity at a higher tempera ture for its advantage of the chelating interaction  between amine 
groups and mercury. From the van’t Hoff plot (ln K versus 1/T; plot not shown), the negative ∆H◦ values of (3.244 
mol −1) confirmed the exothermic nature adsorption, while  the negative values of ∆S◦ (19.24 mJ mol −1 K−1) revealed 
the decreased randomness (orderliness) at the solid /solution interface.

CONCLUSION 
 
Agricultural waste is an effective adsorbent for re moving various heavy metal contaminants. In this st udy, barley 
husk were used to investigate the removal of Cd(II)  in the concentration range of 10–100 mg/L. Increas ing the 
temperature decreased the cadmium adsorption rate, but the maximum adsorption capacity was similar. 
Thermodynamic analysis showed that the adsorption p rocess was exothermic and spontaneous in nature.
