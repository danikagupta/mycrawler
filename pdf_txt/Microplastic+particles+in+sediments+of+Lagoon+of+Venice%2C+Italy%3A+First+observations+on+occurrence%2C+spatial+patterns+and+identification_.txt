Microplastics are omnipresent in the marine environment and sediments are hypothesized to be major
sinks of these plastics. Here, over 100 articles spanning the last 50 year are reviewed with followingobjectives: (i) to evaluate current microplastic extraction techniques, (ii) to discuss the occurrence and
worldwide distribution of microplastics in sediments, and (iii) to make a comprehensive assessment of
the possible adverse effects of this type of pollution to marine organisms. Based on this review wepropose future research needs and conclude that there is a clear need for a standardized techniques,uniﬁed reporting units and more realistic effect assessments.

1. Introduction
Plastic has changed the way we live. It possesses a unique set of
properties making it extremely popular for use in everyday life: it
can be used at a wide range of temperatures, has low thermal
conductivity, a high strength-to-weight ratio, is bio-inert, durable
and above all it is cheap ( Andrady, 2011; Andrady and Neal, 2009 ).
This has led to the use of plastic in a myriad of applications, ranging
from household and personal goods, clothing and packaging to
construction materials. As a result, the global plastic production has
grown exponentially ever since its mass production started in the
1950s, with 288 million tonnes produced worldwide in 2012
(PlasticsEurope, 2013 ). Even though the societal bene ﬁts of plastic
are undeniable ( Andrady and Neal, 2009 ), there are some serious
environmental concerns associated with the material. While a part
of the plastic waste is properly managed (through combustion or
recycling), is has been estimated that millions of tonnes of plastic
waste (4.8 e12.7 million tonnes in 2010) end up the marine envi-
ronment ( Jambeck et al., 2015 ).Plastics are present in the environment in a wide variety of sizes,
ranging from metres to micrometers ( Barnes et al., 2009 ). The
smallest form of plastic litter is called microplastic. These are pre-
sent in the environment as ‘microplastics by design ’, so-called
primary microplastics, or arise from the degradation of larger
plastic litter. While the former are typically resin pellets and
microbeads associated with industrial spillages ( EPA, 1992 ) and the
use of cosmetics ( Fendall and Sewell, 2009; Zitko and Hanlon,
1991 ), the latter (secondary microplastics) are formed through
the action of degrading forces such as UV radiation and physical
abrasion ( Barnes et al., 2009; Cole et al., 2011 ). Another important
source comes from synthetic clothing: a single synthetic garment
can release up to 1900 ﬁbres per washing cycle ( Browne et al.,
2011 ).
At present, there is no universally accepted de ﬁnition regarding
the size of microplastics. When ﬁrst described in 2004, the term
microplastic was adopted to refer to microscopic plastic debris in
the 20 mm region ( Thompson et al., 2004 ). A motion to broaden the
deﬁnition to all fragments smaller than 5 mm was made in 2009
(Arthur et al., 2009 ). While the value of 5 mm is more commonly
accepted, the 1 mm upper size limit is a more intuitive one as
‘micro ’refers to the micrometer range. As a result, this more strict*Corresponding author. Laboratory for Environmental Toxicology and Aquatic

et al., 2011; Claessens et al., 2011; Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013;
Vianello et al., 2013; Dekiff et al., 2014 ).
Microplastics have been reported in the water column and
marine sediments worldwide ( Claessens et al., 2011; Law et al.,
2010; Moore et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 2004 ). While the ﬁrst
reports on microplastics in surface waters already date back to the
early 1970s ( Carpenter et al., 1972; Carpenter and Smith, 1972 ), it
took another 5 years until the ﬁrst records of plastic pellets on
beaches were made ( Gregory, 1977, 1983; Shiber, 1979 ) and another
thirty years until the ﬁrst microplastics ( <1 mm) in sediments were
reported ( Thompson et al., 2004 ). Sediments are suggested to be a
long-term sink for microplastics ( C/C19ozar et al., 2014; Law et al., 2010;
Mor /C19et-Ferguson et al., 2010 ). Logically, plastics with a density that
exceeds that of seawater ( >1.02 g cm/C03) will sink and accumulate in
the sediment, while low-density particles tend to ﬂoat on the sea
surface or in the water column. However, through density-
modi ﬁcation even low-density plastics can reach the sea ﬂoor.
Biomass accumulation due to biofouling can lead to an increase in
density resulting in the sinking of the microplastic ( Andrady, 2011;
Reisser et al., 2013; Zettler et al., 2013 ). Using nitrogen as a proxy,
Mor /C19et-Ferguson et al. (2010) concluded that the reported change in
microplastic density is due to attached biomass. Indeed, analysis of
polyethylene bags submerged in seawater for 3 weeks showed a
signiﬁcant increase in bio ﬁlm formation over time, accompanied by
corresponding changes in physicochemical properties of the plastic,
such as a decrease in buoyancy ( Lobelle and Cunliffe, 2011 ). These
studies suggest that biofouling can contribute towards the settling
and eventual burial in sediments of previously buoyant plastic.
Biomass accumulation on plastic may even partly explain the recent
ﬁnding that the global plastic load in the open-ocean surface is
estimated to be two orders of magnitude lower than expected from
estimates of plastic releases in the marine environment ( C/C19ozar
et al., 2014 ).
The main objective of this review is to assess the state of the
science in the exposure and effects assessment of microplastics
in the marine environment, more speci ﬁcally in marine sedi-
ments. This was achieved by analysing available literature to: (1)
provide an in-depth evaluation of the current and commonly
used techniques for extracting microplastics from sediments, (2)
discuss the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in ma-
rine sediments worldwide and (3) make a comprehensive
assessment of the known effects to benthic and sediment-
associated wildlife.
2. Review of available literature
We conducted an extensive literature review using the ISI Web
of Knowledge and Google Scholar databases. Based on the search
parameters detailed below, a total of 122 original publications were
retrieved, dating back to 1977. The majority of publications (90%)
were published from 2004 onwards, with 75% of all literature
published in the last ﬁve years ( Fig. 1 ). Next to peer-reviewed pa-
pers, conference proceedings, posters and dissertations were alsoincluded in this review.
From these publications, all necessary information regarding (i)
the extraction technique, (ii) microplastic abundance and distri-
bution and in the case of effect assessments (iii) exposure con-
centration and observed effects was extracted and processed.
In the ISI Web of Knowledge, a literature search using the key-
words ‘plastic pellet or microplastic ’in combination with ‘sediment
or beach ’generated a list of 139 peer-reviewed papers. These date
back to 1982 and cover the period until the beginning of 2015. From
these publications a list of 32 papers on occurrence and distribu-
tion, 9 reviews and 5 papers presenting and discussing extractiontechniques was compiled. An additional search on the Google
Scholar search engine, using the same keywords, yielded and
additional 19 publications, posters and dissertations on occurrence
and distribution of microplastics in sediments (1977 e2015).
Using the ISI Web of Knowledge database, the queries ‘micro-
plastic, organism, ingestion ’and ‘microplastic contaminant or
microorganism ’resulted in two publication lists of 18 original
publications each. These publications go back to 1994 and cover
the period until the beginning of 2015. Still, this collection of
publications revealed not all the relevant information on the
direct and indirect effects of microplastics to epibenthic species.
The Google Scholar search engine revealed additional hits for
these queries, including conference posters, conference pro-
ceedings and dissertations. From these lists, a ﬁnal relevant
literature list of 57 publications, posters and dissertations was
composed.
3. Sampling and extraction techniques
Due to the rapid development of microplastic research, there is a
lack of consistency in sampling and extraction techniques used to
quantify microplastics in sediments. As a result of the large variety
in techniques applied, comparison of reported microplastic con-
centrations between studies is often impossible or requires addi-
tional calculations based on assumptions (e.g. sediment densities).
The majority of these method inconsistencies can be related to (i)
differences in the lower and upper size limit implemented, (ii) the
sensitivity of the applied extraction technique and (iii) differences
in sampling technique leading to a wide variety of reporting units.
The lack of an unequivocal size-based de ﬁnition of microplastic
has resulted in the reporting of several different size fractions in
literature, all using the same term: microplastics. In practice, this
means that the results of a substantial body of microplastic litera-
ture cannot be compared directly. As microplastics include particlesup to 5 mm ( Arthur et al., 2009 ) and both extraction and identi ﬁ-
cation becomes more challenging with decreasing dimensions,
authors often opt to only include plastics larger than 1 mm (e.g.
Baztan et al., 2014; Jayasiri et al., 2013; McDermid and McMullen,
2004 )o re v e n >2 mm (e.g. Heo et al., 2013; Ivar do Sul et al.,
2009; Turner and Holmes, 2011 ). Even among those studies that
do include the smallest of microplastics (down to 1.6
mm) different
upper size limits are applied: either 1 mm ( Browne et al., 2011,
2010; Claessens et al., 2011; Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013a )o r
5m m( Martins and Sobral, 2011; Mathalon and Hill, 2014; Ng and
Obbard, 2006; Reddy et al., 2006 ). As both different lower and

Van Cauwenberghe et al. / Marine Environmental Research 111 (2015) 5 e17 6upper size limits are used throughout microplastic literature, a vast
amount of data on microplastic occurrence and distribution
worldwide is lost. Yet, this inconsistent use of the term ‘micro-
plastic ’can be easily addressed by introducing a more compre-
hensive classi ﬁcation to differentiate between small microplastics
(SMPs: <1 mm) and large microplastics (LMPs: 1 e5 mm) ( Fig. 2 )a s
proposed by European MSFD technical subgroup on Marine Litter
(Galgani et al., 2013 ). Another earlier study suggests the following:
micro- ( <0.5 mm) and mesolitter (0.5 e10 mm) ( Gregory and
Andrady, 2003 ). While the discussion often focuses on the upper
size limit of microplastics, it can be argued that the adoption of a
lower size limit is equally important. To date, the lower size limit
used in microplastic assessment studies is highly dependent on the
sensitivity of the sampling and extractions techniques applied.
Often, the technical constraints associated with the extraction of
small microplastics (SMPs) result in the omission of this lower size
limit. However, not including the sub-1 mm fraction can result in
reporting highly underestimated concentrations. Indeed, it has
been demonstrated repeatedly that these small microplastics
represent 35 e90% of all microplastics present in the marine envi-
ronment ( Browne et al., 2010; Eriksen et al., 2013; McDermid and
McMullen, 2004; Song et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014 ).
A wide range of sampling techniques is used for monitoring
microplastics in sediments (reviewed in Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012
and Rocha-Santos and Duarte, 2015 ). As a result, the reported
abundances are often expressed in different units. While a simple
conversion can sometimes be made to compare among studies,
often comparison is impossible or requires assumptions that lead to
biased results. The choice of sampling strategy and sampling
approach (reviewed by Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012 ) will eventually
determine the unit in which observed abundances will be reported.
Those studies sampling an area (using quadrants) will often report
abundances per unit of surface (m2; e.g. Ivar do Sul et al., 2009; Lee
et al., 2013; Martins and Sobral, 2011 ). If areal bulk samples up to a
speci ﬁc depth are taken the reporting unit is m3(e.g. Ballent et al.,
2012; Turra et al., 2014 ). Conversion between these type of abun-
dances is possible, if suf ﬁcient information is available on sampling
depth. Yet, for 20% of the studies this is not the case as reported
sampling depths can range from 0 to 50 cm. Other widely used
reporting units are volume (mL to L; e.g. McDermid and McMullen,
2004; Nor /C19en, 2007; Thompson et al., 2004 ) or weight (g to kg; e.g.
Claessens et al., 2011; Ng and Obbard, 2006; Reddy et al., 2006 ).
Conversion between these two types of units is not straight forward
as detailed information on the density of the sediment is required.
As this is never (as far as we could establish) reported in micro-
plastic studies, assumptions have to be made, as Claessens et al.
(2011) did for the conversion of microplastic abundances in sedi-
ment. Additionally, within studies reporting weight, a distinction
can be made among those reporting wet (sediment) weight and
those reporting dry weight. This adds to the constraints of con-
verting from weight to volume units, or vice versa. Sediment
samples from different locations or even different zones on one
beach (e.g. high littoral vs. sub littoral zone) have different water
content. Therefore, a (limited) number of authors choose to express
microplastic concentrations as dry weight eliminate this variable(Claessens et al., 2011; Dekiff et al., 2014; Ng and Obbard, 2006; Nor
and Obbard, 2014; Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013a; Vianello et al.,
2013 ).
After sampling, either from beach sediments or the seabed,
different approaches can be used to separate the microplastic
fragments from the sandy or muddy matrix. The most common
approach is to extract plastic particles from the sediment using a
density separation, based on the differences in density between
plastic and sediment particles. Typically, this is achieved by
agitating the sediment sample in concentrated sodium chloride
(NaCl) solution, as described by Thompson et al. (2004) . However,
as the density of the NaCl solution is only 1.2 g cm/C03, only low-
density plastics will ﬂoat to the surface and can hence be extrac-
ted. Different authors have addressed this issue by using different
salt solutions to obtain higher densities. Liebezeit et al. (2012) and
Imhof et al. (2013) extracted microplastics from sediments using
zinc chloride (ZnCl 2,1 . 5e1.7 g cm/C03), while others ( Dekiff et al.,
2014; Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013a; Van Cauwenberghe et al.,
2013b ) used a sodium iodide (NaI, 1.6 e1.8 g cm/C03) solution. These
modi ﬁcations of the commonly used method of Thompson et al.
(2004) result in an increased extraction ef ﬁciency for high-
density microplastics such as polyvinylchloride (PVC, density
1.14e1.56 g cm/C03) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET, density
1.32e1.41 g cm/C03). As these high-density plastics make up over 17%
of the global plastic demand ( PlasticsEurope, 2013 ), not including
these types of microplastic can result in a considerable underesti-
mation of microplastic abundances in sediments. Especially as
these high-density plastics are the ﬁrst to settle and incorporate
into marine sediments (density of seawater is 1.02 g cm/C03).
As sampling, extraction and detection methods and techniques
are being developed worldwide ( Claessens et al., 2013; Fries et al.,
2013; Harrison et al., 2012; Imhof et al., 2012; Nuelle et al., 2014 )
it is clear that in order to completely understand the distribution of
microplastics in the marine environment, a harmonisation and
standardisation of techniques and protocols is urgently needed to
enhance microplastic research and monitoring.
4. Occurrence of microplastics in sediments
Theﬁrst reports of microplastics associated with sediments date
back to the late 1970s. These early observations comprised indus-
trial resin pellets (2 e5 mm) on beaches in New Zealand, Canada,
Bermuda, Lebanon and Spain ( Gregory, 1977, 1978, 1983; Shiber,
1979, 1982 ), demonstrating -already back then-their worldwide
distribution. Even in these ﬁrst reports, pellet concentrations
regularly exceeded 1000 pellets per metre of beach, with extreme
abundances reported from 20,000 to 100,000 pellets m/C01(Gregory,
1978 ). Large ports and local plastic industry were considered major
sources, while for Bermuda ewhich lacks such local sources-the
inﬂuence of oceanic circulation patterns (located in the west of
the North Atlantic Gyre) explain the high concentrations ( Gregory,
1983 ). Large numbers of beached industrial pellets in association
with labelled, intact bags detected on beaches in the United Arabian
Emirates and Oman con ﬁrmed the importance of local contami-
nation sources ( Khordagui and Abu-Hilal, 1994 ). Ever since these
Fig. 2. Size matters. Suggestion of plastic debris nomenclature based on size, as proposed by the European MSFD technical subgroup on Marine Litter ( MSFD GES Technical
Subgroup on Marine Litter, 2013 ). The overall term “microplastic ”is composed of small microplastics (SMPs, smaller than 1 mm) and large microplastics (LMPs, 1 e5 mm), to
differentiate between two commonly used de ﬁnitions of microplastics.L. Van Cauwenberghe et al. / Marine Environmental Research 111 (2015) 5 e17 7ﬁrst studies, pellet contamination of beaches worldwide has been
reported ( Table 1 ). For the majority of these studies the main focus
was not to assess the occurrence and abundance of these pellets,
but rather to evaluate the contaminant load present on these pel-
lets. Indeed, their size, long environmental persistence and
worldwide distribution, make them especially suitable for chemical
analysis ( Mato et al., 2001 ). Many hydrophobic compounds
(including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and
degradation products) have been detected on pellets collected from
marine environments. Concentrations of PCBs on polypropylene
pellets collected in Japan were up to 106times that of the sur-
rounding seawater ( Mato et al., 2001 ). Recently, Fotopoulou and
Karapanagioti (2012) demonstrated that surface alterations in
pellets, resulting from environmental erosion, can explain the
increased af ﬁnity for contaminants of pellets ( Endo et al., 2005 ).
While virgin pellets have smooth and uniform surfaces, eroded
pellets exhibited an uneven surface with an increased surface area
and polarity, affecting the ef ﬁciency of sorption ( Fotopoulou and
Karapanagioti, 2012 ).
While the occurrence of industrial resin pellets in marine en-
vironments were already described in the 1970s, it took another 30
years before the ﬁrst reports on other types of microplastics were
published. By analysing subtidal, estuarine and sandy sediments
from 18 locations across the UK, Thompson et al. (2004) were the
ﬁrst to demonstrate the presence of mm-sized ( <1 mm) micro-
plastics in marine sediments. Soon, reports from Singapore ( Ng andObbard, 2006 ), India ( Reddy et al., 2006 ) and Sweden ( Nor/C19en, 2007 )
illustrated the widespread distribution of these small microplastics.
Currently, small and large microplastics are detected in sediments
worldwide: especially beaches, subtidal and offshore sediments
have been examined ( Table 2 ,Fig. 3 ). Recently, even deep oceanic
sediments have been shown to contain microplastics: up to 2000
particles per m2are detected in sediments at a depth of 5000 m
(Fisher et al., 2015; Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013b ). It has also
been demonstrated that the level of plastic pollution is increasing:
sediment core analysis revealed that over the last 20 years micro-
plastic deposition on Belgian beaches tripled ( Claessens et al.,
2011 ).
Due to their easy accessibility, sandy beaches have been the
main focus of studies assessing microplastic abundance (over 80%
of reviewed abundance studies). The zone sampled, however, dif-
fers among studies: while some studies cover entire beach tran-
sects (perpendicular to the shoreline), others studied speci ﬁc
littoral zones. As was already remarked by Hidalgo-Ruz et al.
(2012) , this lack in uniformity between studies explains why the
distribution of microplastics on beaches is still little understood,
and that there is a need to systematically examine potential accu-mulation zones of microplastics. In a recent attempt to elucidate
the distribution of microplastics across the different beach zones,
Heo et al. (2013) analysed the entire cross section (from back-to
foreshore) of an impacted South Korean beach. Their results indi-
cated that, unlike macroplastics, which accumulated at the high
tide line, microplastics (2 e10 mm) were most abundant in the

cate that the mechanisms in ﬂuencing macroplastic distribution on
beaches, like wind and currents ( Carson et al., 2013a; Thornton and
Jackson, 1998 ), affect microplastic distribution in a different way. As
a result, choosing the appropriate site or zone for microplastic
assessment on beaches may not be as straight forward as previ-
ously thought, yet presents a critical factor in the assessment of
microplastic pollution in coastal regions ( Kim et al., 2015 ).
Differences in macro-versus microplastic distribution on bea-
ches was also demonstrated by Browne et al. (2010) in the Tamar
estuary (UK). In this study, plastic density and beach orientation
(up- or downwind) best explained the observed macroplastic dis-tribution, indicating the in ﬂuence of wind created currents in the
distribution of large ﬂoating debris. It was hypothesized that, due to
their small sizes, microplastics in the water column will behave in
the same way as sediment particles. Yet, no clear relationship was
observed between microplastic ( <1 mm) abundance and the pro-
portion of clay in the sediment ( Browne et al., 2010 ). It was
therefore argued that other processes such as aggregation with
organic material might play a more important role in the move-
ment of microplastics. Indeed, Long et al. (2015) demonstrated in alaboratory study that different algae species ( Chaetoceros neogracile
and Rhodomonas salina ) incorporate and concentrate microplastics,
substantially increasing microplastic sinking rates. Moreover,
Strand et al. (2013) demonstrated that there is a strong relationship
between microplastic abundance and both organic (%TOC) and ﬁne
fraction ( <63
mm) content in sediments, supporting the hypothesis
that microplastics will accumulate in depositional areas. In the
Lagoon of Venice, Vianello et al. (2013) detected the lowest
microplastic concentrations in the outer Lagoon, where water
currents are higher ( >1ms/C01). Consequently, the highest concen-
trations were encountered in the inner Lagoon which is charac-
terised by lower hydrodynamics and a higher ﬁne particle ( <63mm)
fraction in the sediment. Aggregation with organic matter (i.e.
marine snow) was also considered the main route of transport for
microplastics to deep-sea sediments ( Van Cauwenberghe et al.,
2013b ).
Microplastics are categorised in different classes, based on their
overall appearance using simple features such as shape, colour, etc.
Several categories are used throughout literature, depending on the
criteria applied by the authors. Types that re-occur frequently are:
pellets, fragments, granules, ﬁbres, ﬁlms and Styrofoam. Due toTable 2

environmental samples. As a result, some studies primarily focus
onﬁbres rather than particles ( Browne et al., 2011, 2010; Fisher
et al., 2015 .;Mathalon and Hill, 2014; Thompson et al., 2004 ). It
was demonstrated by Browne et al. (2011) that such ﬁbres are
indicative of a sewage origin: an increased micro ﬁbre load ( >250%)
was detected in sewage-sludge disposal sites compared to refer-
ence sites. As the majority of microplastic ﬁbres were either poly-
ester or acrylic, synthetic garments were considered important
sources of microplastics. Browne et al. (2011) investigated the
contribution of the use of domestic washing machines and
concluded that washing synthetic garments contribute consider-
able numbers of microplastics to marine environments: up to 1900
ﬁbres can be released into the environment from washing a single
piece of clothing.
Microplastics appear to be more abundant in densely populated
areas. In a study analysing sediments from 18 locations repre-
senting 6 continents, Browne et al. (2011) demonstrated a positive
relationship between microplastic and human population density.Indeed, microplastics are detected in large numbers in highly
populated areas, such as at locations in the North Sea ( Claessens
et al., 2011; Liebezeit and Dubaish, 2012; Nor /C19en, 2007; Thompson
et al., 2004; Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013a ) and the Mediterra-
nean Sea ( Kaberi et al., 2013; Klostermann, 2012; Vianello et al.,
2013 ), as well as in Asia ( Ismail et al., 2009; Ng and Obbard,
2006; Nor and Obbard, 2014; Reddy et al., 2006 ) and the highly
populated coast of Brazil ( Costa et al., 2010; Ivar do Sul et al., 2009;
Turra et al., 2014 ). On heavily polluted beaches, microplastics
(0.25e10 mm) can make up 3.3% of the sediment by weight, as
opposed to 0.12% plastic by weight on control beaches ( Carson et al.,
2011 ). On these Hawaiian beaches, plastics ranging in size from 0.25
to 4 mm were most abundant (55.5%), yet proportions of micro-
plastics (1 e4.75 mm) of up to 90% have been reported as well
(McDermid and McMullen, 2004 ). The link between microplastic
pollution in sediments and human activities has also been
demonstrated by Claessens et al. (2011) , who detected particularly
high concentrations of microplastic granules in the sediments of
coastal harbours. However, as not all types of microplastics could be
linked to sources in the harbours, the importance of rivers as po-
tential sources of microplastics to the marine environment was
stressed. Recently, this was con ﬁrmed by Vianello et al. (2013) , whodetected the highest microplastic concentrations in those areas
inﬂuenced most by freshwater inputs. Recently, the importance of
rivers as sources of microplastics to the marine environment was
demonstrated by Casta ~neda et al. (2014) , who detected high con-
centrations of microbeads in the sediment of the Saint Lawrence
river, Canada. These microbeads were suggested to originate from
municipal and industrial sewage ef ﬂ
uents.
5. Uptake and effects in marine organisms
As microplastic abundances in the environment increase, or-
ganisms inhabiting marine systems are more likely to encounter
these particles. Numerous factors such as size, density, shape,
charge, colour, aggregation and abundance of the plastic particles
affect their potential bioavailability to a wide range of aquatic or-
ganisms ( Kach and Ward, 2008; Wright et al., 2013a ). The oppor-
tunity for encountering or uptake of microplastics by marine
organisms is mainly attributed to two key properties of the parti-
cles: the size and density. For example, particles with a density
higher than that of seawater will become available to benthic
suspension and deposit feeders (as they sink to the sea ﬂoor). As the
size fraction of these microplastics is similar (or even smaller) to
the grain sizes of sediments, microplastics can be ingested not only
by lower trophic-level organisms which capture almost anything of
the appropriate size class, but also by other sediment-dwelling
organisms ( Moore, 2008; Wright et al., 2013a ). Consequently,
plastic particles may accumulate within these organisms upon
ingestion, potentially resulting in direct effects caused by physical
injury in the intestinal tract or even translocation to other tissues or
organs. Sediment-dwelling organisms are sensitive indicator spe-cies for many kinds of naturally and anthropogenically induced
disturbances, and are used worldwide as bio-indicators of
ecosystem health ( OSPAR, 2010; Thain et al., 2008; Van Hoey et al.,
2010 ). Given that this paper deals with the contamination of sed-
iments by microplastics, only species such as echinoderms, poly-
chaetes, crustaceans, bivalves and demersal ﬁsh are considered to
review the uptake of microplastics and potentially associated
effects.
Uptake of microplastics by marine biota has both been investi-
gated in organisms living in natural conditions ( Table 3 ), as well as
in laboratory trials ( Table 4 ). Mussels, such as the blue mussel

wide geographic range, are sedentary, and ﬁlter large volumes of
water. Four recent studies con ﬁrmed the contamination of ﬁeld-
collected M. edulis with microplastics ( Table 3 ). These studies
demonstrated that mussels collected in Europe contained on
average 0.2 e0.5 microplastics/g wet weight (ww) ( De Witte et al.,
2014; Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen, 2014; Van Cauwenberghe
et al., 2015 ), while mussels sampled in Canada revealed a much
higher microplastic load (34 e178 microplastics/mussel) ( Mathalon
and Hill, 2014 ). Decapod crustaceans, such as Norway lobster
(Nephrops norvegicus ) and brown shrimp ( Crangon crangon ), are
opportunistic feeders and have been shown to consume plastic
present in the natural environment ( Table 3 ). A high prevalence of
plastic contamination in Nephrop s (83% of investigated individuals)
was observed in the Clyde Sea area ( Murray and Cowie, 2011 ).
These Nephrops ingested plastic strands (attributed to ﬁshing
waste), and some individuals were contaminated with tightly
tangled balls of synthetic mono ﬁlaments. Devriese et al. (in press)
noticed that plastic contamination in wild C. crangon mainly con-
sisted of microscopic synthetic ﬁbres at concentrations of
0.64±0.53 microplastics/g ww, while only few other types of
microplastics were detected in this species. In Gooseneck barnacles
(Lepas anatifera and L. paci ﬁca) originating from the North Paci ﬁc
Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), 33.5% of individuals had ingested plastic
(Goldstein and Goodwin, 2013 ). The observed plastic contamina-
tion in this ﬁlter feeder consisted of 99% degraded fragments and
1% of mono ﬁlament. Controlled lab studies with crustaceans were
based on two types of exposure routes: exposure through the
surrounding matrix or exposure through contaminated/spiked food
items ( Table 4 ). Using seawater spiked with microplastics, lab ex-
posures with barnacles ( Semibalanus balanoides ) and Carcinus
maenas revealed uptake for both crustaceans ( Thompson et al.,
2004; Watts et al., 2014 ). In C. maenas , uptake of these micro-
spheres was established through inspiration across the gills.
Ingestion due to dietary exposure was established in trials with
three different organisms, C. maenas, Nephrop snorvegicus and
mysid shrimp ( Murray and Cowie, 2011; Farrell and Nelson, 2013;
Set€al€a et al., 2014; Watts et al., 2014 ).N. norvegicus fed with plas-
tic seeded ﬁsh revealed the presence of the spiked ﬁlaments in the
lobsters' stomachs 24 h following ingestion ( Murray and Cowie,
2011 ). Both Farrell and Nelson (2013) and Watts et al. (2014)
conﬁrmed natural trophic transfer of microplastics (0.5 mm and
8e10mm, respectively) from mussels ( M. edulis ) to crab ( C. maenas )
using pre-exposed mussels. Crabs retained these particles for up to
14 days after ingestion ( Watts et al., 2014 ). Trophic transfer of
microplastics from zooplankton to the crustacean Mysis relicta was
demonstrated by Set€al€a et al. (2014) in a laboratory setting using
zooplankton pre-exposed to 10 mm spheres ( Table 4 ). After three
hours, examination of M. relicta showed a 100% prevalence of
microplastics in the animals ’intestine. However, exposure of
another mysid species ( Mysis mixta ) to contaminated prey did not
result in microplastic transfer ( Set€al€a et al., 2014 ). Levels of
microplastics in ﬁve different demersal ﬁsh species from the En-
glish Channel were evaluated by Lusher et al. (2013) . Overall, 35% of
ﬁsh were contaminated with plastic, representing an average
environmental microplastic load of 1.90 ±0.10 particles per indi-
vidual ( Table 3 ). The ingested plastic consisted primarily of ﬁbres,
with the most common size class being 1 e2 mm. Microplastics
ingestion by wild gudgeons ( Gobio gobio ) from French rivers was
also demonstrated ( Sanchez et al., 2014 ).
The blue mussel Mytilus edulis is by far the species used most to
study microplastics effect studies. Given that M. edulis living in
natural habitat takes up microplastics, a number of lab trials have
been performed to assess the potential adverse effects of micro-
plastics uptake ( Table 4 ). These, often, short-term effect assays aretypically conducted with a single type and/or size of plastic at
particle concentrations much higher than realistic environmental
levels. Wegner et al. (2012) demonstrated the increased production
of pseudofaeces and reduced ﬁlter activity after exposure to 30 nm
nanopolystyrene (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 g/L), which according to the au-
thors may lead to increases in the energy expenditure and reduce
the organism's food uptake at long term exposure. However, no
signiﬁcant reduction in feeding activity or decrease in energy
budget were demonstrated by Browne et al. (2008) and Van
Cauwenberghe et al. (2015) .Von Moos and co-workers (2012) did
observed adverse effects, such as a strong in ﬂammatory response,
induced by the uptake of small plastic particles after only 3 h of
exposure ( Table 4 ). Short-term exposure experiments with small
polystyrene (PS) spheres (3.0 mm and 9.6 mm; 1.5 /C2104particles/
400 mL) and HDPE spheres ( >0e80mm; 2.5 g/L) revealed their
translocation (especially of smaller microspheres) from the diges-
tive tract to the circulatory system and digestive cells of M. edulis
(Browne et al., 2008; Von Moos et al., 2012 ). Translocation of
microplastics after ingestion was also demonstrated for the crab
Carcinus maenas (Farrell and Nelson, 2013 ). Using pre-exposed
mussels, this study demonstrated the translocation of smallmicroplastics to the hemolymph of the crabs after indirect expo-
sure, i.e. exposure through contaminated prey. In a similar setup,
however, Watts et al. (2014) didﬁnd any indications of trans-
location to the hemolymph in exposed crabs. An important
sediment-associated marine organisms that has been the subject of
several microplastic effect assessments is the lugworm Arenicola
marina (Table 4 ). In a short-term exposure (14 days) experiment,
lugworms were exposed to sediment spiked with 10
mm, 30 mm and
90mm PS spheres (total concentration of 100 particles.g/C01sedi-
ment). While these short-term exposure did not demonstrate a
signiﬁcant effect on the energy metabolism ( Van Cauwenberghe
et al., 2015 ), mid-term trials (28 days) revealed clear severe ef-
fects ( Wright et al., 2013b ). After 28 days of exposure to 5% by
weight unplasticised PVC (mean diameter 130 mm), a signi ﬁcant
decrease in body weight and a signi ﬁcant reduction of the feeding
activity was observed, which was ultimately re ﬂected by a deple-
tion of up to 50% of the energy reserves ( Wright et al., 2013b ).
Regrettably, due to the lack of consistency in the assays used and
technical challenges (e.g. dif ﬁculties in dissecting invertebrates),
environmental levels of microplastics in invertebrate organisms are
difﬁcult to interpret. As a result, intra- and interspecies evaluation
is very dif ﬁcult. The most common discrepancies can be related to
the organ or tissues examined, the extraction protocol (e.g. diges-
tion of tissues), the risk of airborne contamination ( Woodall et al.,
2015 ), the particle size range assessed, the reporting unit and the
identi ﬁcation of plastics ( Song et al., 2015 ). For example, hot acid
digestion using HNO 3(69%) was proposed by Claessens et al.
(2013) , while an adaptation using a 4:1 (v:v) mixture of nitric
acid (65% HNO 3) and perchloric acid (68% HClO 4) was used by
Devriese et al. (in press) . Furthermore, Mathalon and Hill (2014)
used an oxidizing agent (30% H 2O2) to remove animal tissue. Be-
sides the digestion assay, the particle retention of the used ﬁlters to
ﬁltrate the digest outlines the observed particle size range. For this
reason Mathalon and Hill (2014) assessed microplastics >0.8mm,
Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen (2014) >5mm, while De Witte et al.
(2014) evaluated microplastics >20mm.
The published microplastics effect assessments are typically
conducted with only one type or size of plastic (mostly micro-
spheres) at particle concentrations much higher than the envi-
ronmental levels. Strikingly, all the lab trials are based on short-to
mid-term (hours to 28 days) exposure to unrealistically high
concentrations. These papers revealed a range of effects exhibited
ingestion by a number of species, e.g. decrease of energy reserves,
inhibition or reduction of feeding/ ﬁltering activity, translocationL. Van Cauwenberghe et al. / Marine Environmental Research 111 (2015) 5 e17 12to the circulatory system, in ﬂammatory response and develop-
mental defects. A few papers observed trophic transfer of micro-
plastics and suggest an impact on the food web. Although more
research is needed to determine whether plastics of any di-
mensions can be transferred through the food chain, translocation
effects do suggest that particle size really matters. For evaluating
the environmental risk of microplastics knowledge is required on
the environmental levels and types of plastic, the translocation
size limit and the relevant biological endpoints. Additionally,
long-term exposures under controlled conditions with environ-
mentally relevant microplastics concentrations and types are
needed to allow a realistic assessment of potential microplastic-
associated risks.
5.1. Indirect effects
Due to their speci ﬁc characteristics, microplastics not only pose
a direct threat to (marine) organisms, but they are also believed to
have indirect effects on organisms. We de ﬁne indirect effects as an
effect caused when microplastics act as a vector for either chem-
icals (i.e. chemical threat) or bacteria (i.e. bacterial threat).
The chemical threat of microplastic is complex and works at
different levels. Plastic polymers, owing to their large size, are
considered to be biochemically inert. However, as polymerization
reactions are rarely complete, residual monomers can still be found
in the polymer matrix. Residual monomer content of a plastic can
vary from 0.0001% to 4% ( Araújo et al., 2002 ). These monomers can
leach out of the polymeric material and, as some of these are
considered toxic (including carcinogenic and mutagenic effects),
they can pose a threat to the environment. This effect can be esti-
mated based on the monomer hazard ranking as described by
Lithner et al. (2011) . Most hazardous polymers belong to the fam-
ilies of polyurethanes, polyvinyl chloride and styrene, amongst
others ( Lither, 2011 ). Additional toxic effects of microplastics can
also be caused by the wide array of plastic additives added during
plastic manufacturing. Examples are the initiators, catalysts and
solvents, all of which are added to obtain speci ﬁc features of the
ﬁnal polymer. But also antimicrobial agents, such as Triclosan,
plasticisers, ﬂame retardants (PBDEs), pigments and ﬁllers are used
in the compounding of plastic. All these non-polymeric compo-
nents are of low molecular weight and therefore able to migrate or
diffuse from the plastic polymer, potentially causing (adverse) ef-
fects ( Crompton, 2007 ).
This migration behaviour is similar for chemical contaminants
(POPs) adsorbed on microplastics. It is known that a plethora of
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can sorb from the environment
(i.e. seawater and sediment) on/in the plastic matrix of (micro)
plastics. The presence of such POPs on marine plastics (especially
industrial resin pellets) has been demonstrated for a wide variety of
chemicals and for different geographic areas (e.g. Mato et al., 2001;
Endo et al., 2005; Hirai et al., 2011; Bakir et al., 2014 ) (see Table 1 for
additional studies on contaminant assessment on industrial resin
pellets). These contaminants have a greater af ﬁnity for the plastic
matrix than the surrounding seawater leading to an accumulationonto the plastic particle. This accumulation was found to be up to
one million times higher in some cases ( Hirai et al., 2011 ). Polymer
type plays an important role in this contamination accumulation:
under identical sorption conditions, polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are consis-
tently found in a higher concentration on high-density poly-
ethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and
polypropylene (PP), compared to polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), while phenanthrene sorbs more to PE
than PP or PVC ( Bakir et al., 2012; Rochman et al., 2013; Bakir et al.,
2014 ). As a result, possible effects of both the polymer andassociated contaminants have to be considered when assessing the
potential risks of microplastics.
Although frequently suggested, the evidence to support this
chemical threat is rather limited. So far controlled lab exposures
have been performed with the lugworm ( Arenicola marina ), the
model organism for deposit feeders. Exposure of A. marina
to PCB-
loaded microplastics (at a dose of 7.4% microplastics by dry weight)
showed an effect on feeding activity, resulting in weight loss
(Besseling et al., 2013 ).Browne et al. (2013) demonstrated a
decreased phagocytic activity by over 60% in A. marina exposed to
sand with 5% microplastic (PVC, 230 mm) presorbed with non-
ylphenol. However, no such effect was reported for phenanthrene.
While nonylphenol and phenanthrene desorbed from the PVC
particles and transferred to the animals ’tissue, the lugworms
accumulated >250% more of these contaminants when exposed to
contaminated sand ( Browne et al., 2013 ).
The bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has
been theoretically investigated by Gouin et al. (2011) andKoelmans
et al. (2013) using a modelling approach. Both studies suggested
that microplastics are only of minor importance as vectors of POPs
to organisms. Koelmans et al. (2013) even predicted a decrease in
contaminant body burden due to a cleaning mechanism of strong
sorbent plastics, counteracting biomagnification. In a similar
modelling exercise, Koelmans et al. (2014) investigated the leaching
of plastic associated chemicals, i.e. additives, to marine organisms.
The rationale behind this modelling approach is the fact that for
additives plastic ingestion by marine organisms may be more
relevant than for diffusely spread POPs as the microplastics act as a
source of the additives ( Koelmans et al., 2014 ). The results showed
that ingestion of microplastics can be considered a substantial
pathway for additive exposure. It is clear that further research on
this topic is essential to fully understand the impact of sorbed and
plastic-associated contaminants on marine organisms, and by
extension the entire marine and human food web. So far, studies to
assess the transfer of (environmentally relevant concentrations of)
chemicals, both pollutants and additives, have not been performed
on resident organisms, clearly indicating that this is an area that
needs further research.
The bacterial threat of marine litter and by extension micro-
plastics arises from the fact that they represent new habitats in the
marine environment and, as such, can serve as a substrate for
(micro)biological interactions. Microplastics have a hydrophobic
surface that stimulates rapid bio ﬁlm formation ( Zettler, 2013 ). So
far, conventional microbial identi ﬁcation methodologies require a
bacterial cultivation step using a growth medium, has hampered
the full characterization of the microbial bio ﬁlm due to the ‘great
plate count anomaly ’(Staley and Konopka, 1985 ). This term has
been used to describe the fact that the majority (99 e99.9%) of cells
within an environmental sample are not recoverable in pure cul-
ture using classical microbial plating. However, the recent break-
through of ‘Next Generation Sequencing ’technology allows for the
full characterization of complex microbial samples without a
cultivation step. This was nicely demonstrated in the pioneering
work of Zettler et al. (2013) and will contribute signi ﬁcantly to
bioﬁlm characterization.
Due to their persistence in nature, (micro)plastics exhibit a
longer half life than other marine substrates, creating an interesting
habitat for microorganisms. For fouling, microbial bio ﬁlm forma-
tion is the initial step ( Dobretsov, 2010 ), while in the consecutive
steps so-called epiplastic organism like diatoms, ciliates and a wide
variety of other organisms will attach on the formed bio ﬁlm
(Reisser et al., 2014a ). The formation of these bio ﬁlms on micro-
plastics is of concern as they might contain human or animal
pathogens that could potentially endanger animal and human
health, and impact economic activities. Additionally, the nutritionalL. Van Cauwenberghe et al. / Marine Environmental Research 111 (2015) 5 e17 13value of these bio ﬁlms might encourage grazing and ingestion of
the covered microplastics ( Reisser et al., 2014b ). Associated impacts
hence include food web effects.
In 2011, Harrison et al. published a call for research, calling upon
the scienti ﬁc community to investigate the colonisation, taxonomic
composition and functional potential of microplastic-associated
bioﬁlms, in order to understand ecological implications and to
develop management measures to safeguard marine life. As a
response, research started focussing on characterizing the microbial
assemblages of ﬂoating microplastic particles ( Carson et al., 2013b;
Reisser et al., 2014a; Zettler et al., 2013 ).Carson et al. (2013) inves-
tigated the bio ﬁlms of 100 particles (1 e10 mm) collected in the
Northeast Paci ﬁc, and determined that plastic type appeared to in-
ﬂuence bacteria abundance. Zettler et al. (2013) discovered that
microplastic-associated communities differ signi ﬁcantly from those
in the surrounding seawater. For example, several hydrocarbon
degraders were detected on the plastic but not in the seawater,
indicating microorganisms may possibly play a role in plastic
degradation ( Zettler et al., 2013 ). Colonisation and bio ﬁlm charac-
terisation of microplastics in marine sediments has been far less
investigated. Harrison et al. (2014) used a coastal sediment micro-
cosm and demonstrated that bacteria in marine sediments rapidly
colonise low density polyethylene (LDPE) microplastic fragments
(5 mm). As was the case for seawater ( Zettler et al., 2013 ), the
bacterial communities detected on the plastic were signi ﬁcantly
different from those in the surrounding sediment. Interestingly, the
dominant taxa ( Acrobacter and Colwellia spp.) on microplastics from
sediments were not found to be present on ﬂoating microplastics,
indicating that distinct bio ﬁlms are likely to occur between different
marine habitat types ( Harrison et al., 2014 ).
6. Conclusions and outlook
Important advances have been made with respect to our un-
derstanding of the occurrence and impacts of microplastics in
marine environment. However, as this research ﬁeld is rapidly
evolving, especially in the last 10 years as is re ﬂected in the expo-
nential growth of peer-reviewed publications, several issues can be
identi ﬁed regarding the nomenclature and classi ﬁcation of micro-
plastics and applied methodologies and techniques. The current
lack in standardisation and harmonisation greatly hampers the
inter-study comparison and data transfer, not only for reported
abundances but also for (measured) effects and impacts. We
therefore recommend the implementation of an unequivocal size-
based de ﬁnition for microplastics, based on both upper and lower
size limits, and a uniform nomenclature. Also practical issues
concerning the assessment of occurrence and effects should be
addressed and standardised. Today, a plethora of sampling,
extraction and identi ﬁcation techniques are in use. An important
point of interest is the harmonisation of extraction techniques.
While the majority of extraction techniques are based on the same
principle, i.e. density separation, a wide assortment of variations on
this principle exist. Some are more ef ﬁcient in extracting different
types of microplastics (i.e. differences in density) than others, but insome cases this comes at an extra cost. It is clear that a standard
extraction technique, especially for monitoring purposes, should be
adopted by the research and regulatory community. In general,
depending on the research question addressed, sampling strategies
will differ. Yet, by reporting the complete set of sampling details
(i.e. sampling depth, sediment weight or volume, but also sediment
density, water content, etc.) differences between sampling tech-
niques can be bypassed, and inter-study comparison facilitated. As
such, this proposed harmonisation will assist future, uniform
microplastic abundance assessments, and allow science-based
geographical comparison and time trend assessments.A general conclusion regarding the assessment of potential
(adverse) effects following microplastic uptake in marine organ-
isms concerns the experimental set-up of such experiments. In
general, experimental microplastic concentrations are several or-
ders of magnitude higher than current environmental concentra-
tions, and all lab trial exposure periods are short-to mid term.
While such approaches are often performed using ‘proof of prin-
ciple ’experiments, and deemed necessary to assess the importance
of this type of pollution, testing at high, environmentally unreal-
istic, concentrations does not provide any information on the cur-
rent adverse effects on or risks to marine ecosystems. Future effect
assessments of microplastics should therefore focus on mimicking
more ‘natural ’exposure conditions. More speci ﬁcally, there is a
need for more long-term exposure assessments of environmentally
relevant concentrations of naturally occurring assemblages of
microplastics (i.e. different sizes, shapes and types).
The chemical threat of microplastics has been studied elabo-
rately in the past years, raising some concerns. While adverse
biological effects have been measured in the lab, some studies
suggest (small) microplastics play only a minor part in the total
body load of such environmental contaminants in marine organ-isms. While there is a growing body of literature regarding pol-
lutants on microplastics, additives, or plastic-associated chemicals,
are far less studied. Yet, due to the lower concentrations of these
additives in the environment, transfer of these chemicals from
microplastics to organisms might be more relevant than the sorbed
chemicals. However, it is clear that further research on this topic is
essential to fully understand the impact of sorbed and plastic-
associated contaminants on marine organisms, and by extension
the entire marine, and human, food web.
A far less researched potential threat of microplastics, is the
presence and transfer of (potentially harmful) marine microorgan-
isms associated with these plastics. To date, only limited literature is
available on microplastic bio ﬁlm characterisation. We need to un-
derstand the colonisation dynamics and taxonomic composition
(more speci ﬁcally the presence and transport of pathogens and
other harmful species) to properly assess the ecological implica-
tions, as these organisms could result in ecological and economical
consequences to the marine food webs and human health.
