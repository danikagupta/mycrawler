Summary 
Disulfide bond formation is necessary for a correct folding and a proper function of many secreted 
proteins. We know that many of these proteins are involved in bacterial virulence and pathogenesis. The 
best known pathways of disulfide bond formation and isomerization belong to Escherichia coli (E. coli) .
This Gram-negative bacterium is usually used as a model organism. This review is aimed initially at 
introduction to E. coli oxido-reductase enzymatic system. The next part is interested in proteins resembling 
these from E. coli and their relation to virulence and pathogenesis. We have choosen three important Gram- 
negative pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) and Francisella 
tularensis (F . tularensis) , because of their high virulence, infectivity, ability to cause severe infections and 
absence of appropriate vaccines.

INTRODUCTION 
Secreted proteins play a very important role in 
bacterial pathogenesis and virulence. For proper 
function of these proteins there are requirements 
of correct folding and stabilization of protein 
structure. The formation of disulfide bonds bet -ween two cysteine residues is vital to correct pro -
tein folding. Failure to form right disulfide bonds 
is probably reason of protein misfolding, which 
leads to aggregation and degradation. 
In Gram-negative bacteria, disulfide bond for -
mation is catalyzed by the Dsb proteins present in 
the periplasm [22]. In E. coli , as in eukaryotes, di -
sulfide bonds are generally found in exported pro -
teins, but are rare in cytoplasmic proteins [15]. The 
difference in the thiol/disulfide redox state bet -
ween the cytoplasm and the periplasm may be suf -
ficient for preventing disulfides in the cytoplasm 
[3]. Dsb proteins belong to thioredoxin-fold pro -
teins which have one or more thioredoxin folds. 
These folds contain characteristic four α- helices

that are juxtaposed with five β- strands ( β-α-β-α-β- 
α-β-β-α ) [6]. The next characteristic mark is 
-CXXC- (X = any amino acid) motif in front of the 
first helix. Many of them contain other domain in -
sertions with importance in substrate recognition 
and reactivity [26]. The -CXXC- motif is a major 
factor determining the function of the protein [52]. 
The type of the amino acids (X) between active 
site cysteines varies greatly among members of thioredoxin family [6]. Depending on their role the 
-CXXC- is in the reduced form with a dithiol or in 
the oxidized form with an intramolecular disulfide 
bond [36]. Each of the Dsb proteins has a specific 
physiological role in oxidation, reduction or iso -
merization of disulfides. Moreover, the thioredo -
xin-fold family includes the eukaryotic protein 
disulfide isomerase and the ubiquitous reductants, 
thioredoxin and glutaredoxin [19]. Senitkova et al.: The disulfide bond formation and its relationship to bacterial pathogenicity

The formation of disulfide bonds in E. coli can 
be divided into two steps. The first is the oxidation 
of cysteine residues to form disulfides (DsbA and 
DsbB proteins), and the second is the isomerization 
of incorrect disulfide bonds to the correct form 
(DsbC, DsbG and DsbD proteins) [41] (Figure 1), 
so the isomerase pathway has a proof-reading role 
[16]. Formation and breakage of a disulfide bond 
are chemical reactions, in which two electrons are 
donated to or taken away from a cysteine pair. This 
system plays on the oxidizing and the reducing 
equivalents originating from quinone and NADPH [26]. Although the oxidization and reduction 
pathways reside in the same cellular compartment, 
it was found that their crosstalk should be 
minimized to avoid invalid consumption of 
electrons and metabolic energy. In vitro kinetic 
measurements of reactions between various 
combinations of DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD α and 
DsbB γ showed that only 'physiological' 
combination and direction are formed rapidly [55]. 
Increasing number of sequenced bacteria 
genomes shows that formation of disulfide bonds is diverse and not all bacteria share this type of 
oxidative folding device. Heras et al. carried out a 
bioinformatical screening for Dsb homologues 
(predominantly DsbA homologues) and in total they 
found that of 421 genomes searched, 51 bacteria 
encoded more than one DsbA and 156 organisms 
lacked an identifiable DsbA [21]. 
This review focuses on Dsb proteins in general, 
describing E. coli proteins as a model and their 
homologues in N. meningitidis, Y. pestis and F. 
tularensis. We have choosen these Gram-negative 
bacteria because they possess some similar features. 
They can be transmitted by aerosol, cause serious 
diseases to humans, which can end in epidemic. 
There are also problems with fast diagnostics and 
with their antibiotic resistance. Y. pestis and F. 
tularensis are members of category A of potential 
biological weapons [31] so they are also important 
for military health care. We are interested in 
function of Dsb homologues and their role in 
bacterial virulence and pathogenesis. 
PROTEINS INVOLVED IN THE DISULFIDE 
BOND FORMATION SYSTEM (Dsb) 
DsbA catalyses disulfide bond formation 
DsbA is one of the most oxidizing thiol-disulfide 
oxidoreductases known. It has a redox potential of 
-121 mV [75]. Its highly oxidizing nature is a result 
of hydrogen bond, electrostatic and helix-dipole 
interactions [19]. It is very important that oxidized 
DsbA is less stable than reduced DsbA even if it is 
known that disulfides generally stabilize proteins 
[73]. Because of the great oxidizing potential of 
DsbA, there is a great possibility of incorrect 
disulfides formation [16]. These incorrect disulfides 
have to be refit to prevent protein misfolding and 
aggregation. This is a commission for two disulfide 
isomerases, DsbC and DsbG [36]. 
DsbA has a redox-active site -CXXC- like other 
redox-active members of the thioredoxin fold family. 
This motif converts from disulfide to dithiol. 
Adjacent cis -Pro motif is involved in substrate 
interaction [28]. This cis -Pro is conserved in most 
proteins with thioredoxin fold. It is known that 
mutation in this cis -Pro dramatically influences the 
stability of the protein [36]. Surface groove near the 
active site Cys30-Cys33 is considered to be putative 
substrate binding site [22]. This hydrophobic groove 
is formed by a helical insertion [26]. DsbA is acting 
as a thiol-reductase thus -CXXC- motif is found oxidized in vivo . The disulfide bond existing in 
DsbA is very unstable and can be quickly transferred 
to newly translocated protein [36]. After this transfer 
DsbA appears in the reduced form. 
The crystal structures of reduced and oxidized 
DsbA show that hinge bending motions occur 
between two domains. These motions are not 
dependent on the redox state but it is a result of 
interactions at the putative peptide-binding groove 
of DsbA. This motion could be important for 
substrate binding and/or for interactions with other 
proteins as DsbB [19]. 
It is believed that DsbA creates disulfide bonds 
indiscriminately and mostly between cysteine 
residues that are consecutive in the primary 
sequence. But it was demonstrated that oxidation is 
not strictly cotranslocational and that it is in kinetic 
competition with folding [37]. 
Numerous studies interested in substrates of 
DsbA suggest that DsbA has a broad substrate 
specificity. More than 300 periplasmic and 
membrane proteins contain 2 or more cysteine 
residues and could be DsbA substrates. But only a 
small number of putative substrates have been in fact 
identified. The reason could be that other proteins 
are not measurable under laboratory conditions [23]. 
DsbA seems to be very important in bacterial 
virulence. It was shown to be crucial in biogenesis 
of toxins and multimeric structures on the bacterial 
surface (e.g. fimbriae, adhesive molecules, 
components of secretory machinery). In fact, dsbA 
mutant is severely defective in the formation of 
disulfide bond in vivo [3] and it is observed 
accumulation of periplasmic proteins in their 
reduced form [77]. Mutation in dsbA usually creates 
the same phenotypic effect as a mutation in the gene 
encoding the virulence determinant itself [74]. 
DsbB keeps DsbA in the active form 
Reoxidation of DsbA is performed by the 
membrane protein DsbB [40]. Once DsbA donates 
its disulfide to a substrate protein, DsbA is 
reoxidized to carry out other disulfide catalysis [22]. 
DsbB creates four-helix-bundle structure passing 
through the inner membrane. Furthermore it contains 
a short periplasmic loop and a longer flexible 
periplasmic region with a short, horizontal α- helix 
[24]. Each of the periplasmic loops contains one pair 
of essential cystenes: Cys41-Cys44 and Cys104- 
Cys130. The Cys104-Cys130 pair is involved in the 
disulfide exchange with DsbA, the second pair of 
Cys41-Cys44 is the target of oxidation by 
ubiquinone [25]. 
120 Senitkova et al.: The disulfide bond formation and its relationship to bacterial pathogenicity DsbB is reoxidized by components of the 
respiratory chain. Under aerobic conditions, DsbB 
transfers the electrons to oxidized ubiquinone. It 
becomes reoxidized by the terminal cytochrome 
oxidases, which finally transfer the electrons onto 
molecular oxygen. There is another situation under 
anaerobic conditions. DsbB transfers electrons to 
menaquinone, which passes them to the fumarate or 
nitrate [2]. 
DsbC corrects the misfolded disulfide bonds 
E. coli encodes two disulfide isomerases, DsbC 
and DsbG. They share just 24% sequence identity, 
both are homodimers with each monomer 
comprising a catalytic thioredoxin domain jointed 
by a linker α- helix to a dimerization domain [20]. 
Two subunits form a V-shape structure with 
hydrophobic surface on its inner part. This is 
probably a binding site of substrates [22]. DsbC is 
kept in a reduced form by DsbD. DsbC must be in 
the reduced form in order to has its Cys98 prepared 
for attack on a wrong disulfide of a substrate to 
initiate isomerization [26]. 
There are number of possible mechanisms by 
which DsbC can isomerize incorrect disulfide 
bonds. First, DsbC can attack incorrect disulfides 
forming mixed disulfide between the more N- 
terminal cysteine of DsbC and the protein 
substrates. This situation can be immediately 
transferred back, but with correct disulfide bond 
pattern. The second way is that the mixed disulfide 
can be resolved such that DsbC is oxidized and the 
substrate is reduced. The reduced form of substrate 
can then be reoxidized by DsbA or DsbC [16]. But 
there is some evidence against the first model and 
in favour of the second reduction/reoxidation 
mechanism [54]. 
The crystal structure of oxidized DsbC shows 
two 23 kDa monomers of DsbC which form a V- 
shaped homodimer. Each monomer consists of two 
domains: a C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain 
with active site Cys 98 -Gly-Tyr-Cys 101 and an N- 
terminal dimerization domain connected via a 
flexible linker helix [35]. Except its isomerase 
activity, DsbC also has the chaperone activity. In 
vitro , DsbC can assist the refolding of denaturated 
proteins like lysozyme or glyceraldehyde-3- 
phosphate dehydrogenase [7]. The function of 
DsbC as isomerase and chaperone is completely 
dependent on its dimerization because a 
heterodimer that has had one of the -CXXC- sites 
inactivated by carboxymethylation has no 
isomerase activity [61]. DsbG also works as disulfide isomerase 
DsbG is a second putative isomerase. Primarily 
it was described as a disulfide oxidase [1], but 
nowadays it is considered that DsbG acts as an 
isomerase in periplasm of E. coli [4]. This confirmed 
the study of crystal structures of the DsbG. The 
oxidized structure reveals a mixture of reduced and 
oxidized forms. This suggests that oxidized DsbG is 
less stable than the reduced form. This information 
can contribute to DsbG isomerase activity, which 
requires that the active-site cysteine residues are kept 
reduced, regardless of the oxidative environment of 
the periplasm [20]. 
DsbG forms a dimer and has a two conserved 
cysteine residues, Cys109 and Cys 112, which are 
present in a -CXXC- motif [4]. The protein appears 
as a V-shaped protein with two domains, N-terminal 
dimerization domain and C-terminal catalytic 
domain with thioredoxin fold where -CXXC- motif 
is located [36]. 
There are some structural similarities but also 
differences between the isomerase DsbC and DsbG 
[20]. Actually, DsbG does not catalyze the folding of 
proteins known as substrates of DsbC [22]. DsbG is 
spatially larger and has longer linker connecting two 
domains. Also a V-shaped cleft has negatively 
charged patches. Another difference is the charged 
groove formed by residues in a loop connecting two 
β strands of the N-terminus. These facts can help with 
detection of DsbG substrates [36]. 
DsbD is the partner protein of DsbC and DsbG 
DsbD is the inner membrane redox-active 
protein. Its role is maintenance of DsbC, DsbG and 
DsbE (also called CcmG a specific disulfide 
reductase involved in c-type cytochrome maturation 
in the periplasm) in their active reduced form [23]. 
These proteins contain thioredoxin-like domains with 
characteristic -CXXC- motif. These cysteines are the 
targets of the DsbD, when they are joined in disulfide 
bonds [47]. DsbD plays a key role in transferring 
electrons from the reducing cytoplasm to the 
oxidative environment of the periplasm. DsbD has 
two periplasmic domains, an immunoglobulin-like 
N-terminal domain (nDsbD or α) and a thioredoxin- 
like C-terminal domain (cDsbD or γ). Either is linked 
to a central transmembrane domain (tDsbD or β). 
Each of the domains has two reactive cysteines [22]. 
Some studies established that electrons flow from 
NADPH in the cytosol, via TRX-1 (thioredoxin-1), 
β, γ and α to DsbC [29]. The mechanism by which 
DsbD β is able to transfer electrons across the 
121 Senitkova et al.: The disulfide bond formation and its relationship to bacterial pathogenicity cytoplasmic membrane via its pair of cysteines 
Cys163 and Cys285 is not completely explained. But 
Cho et al. [8] present a structural model where 
DsbD β creates two cavities that are inside the 
membrane portion of the protein, to accommodate 
the appropriate interacting thioredoxin protein. This 
structural model could elucidate a mechanism of 
electron transfer. 
Homologues of DsbD or of one or more of its 
domain were found in a wide range of bacteria, 
including species of Archae. These bacteria also 
contain DsbC/DsbG homologues [47]. 
DsbE (CcmG) has specific reductase activity 
DsbE, also called CcmG, also belongs into 
thioredoxin-fold proteins with regard to its sequence 
and functionality. DsbE has a highly specialized role 
in electron transport in periplasm. DsbE is involved 
in cytochrome c maturation (Ccm). Cytochrome c is 
the protein with covalently bound heme as a cofactor, 
which is necessary for respiratory and/or 
photosynthetic electron transport chains. Cytochrome 
c maturation requires ligation of heme to reduced 
thiols of the apocytochrome [69]. Maturation of c- 
type cytochromes in Gram-negative bacteria is done 
in the periplasm during a series of sequential or co- 
ordinated steps [53] and requires redox control. The 
heme attachment to the apocytochrome cannot come 
unless the heme binding cysteines are in the thiol, 
reduced form. But these cysteines can be oxidized by 
DsbA when apocytochrome is secreted into the 
periplasm [10]. DsbE selectively donates electrons to 
apocytochrome c cysteines via another periplasmic 
cytochrome c maturation factors [11] in order to 
restore the apocytochrome c cysteines to reduced 
form. DsbE is maintained in its reduced form by 
DsbD [59]. DsbE has a highly hydrophobic N- 
terminus, which is predicted to function as a 
membrane anchor and a hydrophobic TRX 
(thioredoxin) domain is presumed to face toward the 
periplasm [33]. DsbE, as in all redox TRX-like 
proteins, has a -CXXC- motif at the N-terminus of 
the first helix in the TRX fold. The crystale structure 
of DsbE homologue from Bradyrhizobium 
japonicum revealed that the active site is however 
unusual in its surrounding region with negative 
charge. This speciality seems to be conserved among 
DsbE homologues. There is also a groove near the 
active site. Residues in the insert are conserved in 
DsbE homologues, and deletion of the central insert 
restrains cytochrome c maturation [10]. 
Dsb homologues were also found in Gram- 
positive bacteria, for instance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis . These were homologues to DsbE and 
DsbD. But some structural and functional differences 
between these proteins in Gram-positive and Gram- 
negative bacteria were observed [17]. 
In recent studies other important proteins 
involved in disulfide bond formation in E. coli were 
found. The uropathogenic E. coli strain CFT073 
contains an additional oxidative system, DsbL and 
DsbI, which is encoded in a tri-cistronic operon 
together with a periplasmic, uropathogen-specific 
arylsulfate sulfotransferase (ASST). It is proposed 
that the DsbL/DsbI pair was acquired as a specific 
redox couple which maintains biological activity of 
ASST [18]. 
IMPORTANT GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA 
POSSESSING Dsb SYSTEM 
Neisseria meningitidis 
The Neisseria is a large family of bacteria where 
the 11 species are able to colonize the humans, but 
only two can cause a disease. Neisseria gonorrhoeae 
(N. gonorrhoeae) is a mucosal pathogen that causes 
a gonorrhoea, one of the most wide-spread sexual 
diseases. N. meningitidis is generally a commensal 
bacterium colonizing the nasopharynx of germ 
carriers. But this bacterium is also a potential 
pathogen and the causative agent of a life threatening 
cerebrospinal meningitis and systemic sepsis. The 
bacteria can be spread by aerosol and huge epidemic 
meningitis cases are known from sub-Sahara Africa 
[66]. The disease process is very abrupt so there is a 
problem with early diagnosis. Another problem is the 
antibiotic resistance so N. meningitidis remains a 
significant worldwide health danger. 
The genome of N. meningitidis encodes 
homologues for DsbD, DsbC and DsbB proteins, but 
not for DsbE or DsbG proteins [65]. There are also 
some differences between DsbA homologues across 
neisserial species. N. meningitidis has three genes 
which encode three active DsbAs (DsbA1, DsbA2, 
DsbA3). These genes are named nmb0278 , nmb0294 
and nmb0407 in the sequenced genome of the 
serogroup B strain MC58 [32]. N. gonorhoeae ,
Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea and Neisseria 
polysaccharea possess homologues of nmb0278 
(DsbA1) and nmb0407 (DsbA3) alone. Neisseria 
flava, Neisseria subflava and Neisseria flavescens 
possess only homologue of nmb0294 (DsbA2). The 
diversity of these proteins can suggest the possibility 
122 Senitkova et al.: The disulfide bond formation and its relationship to bacterial pathogenicity of their specialized role in bacterial biology including 
virulence [58]. Each of DsbAs shows different 
enzymatic properties. DsbA1 and DsbA2 are 
lipoproteins associated with the inner membrane, 
while DsbA3 is a soluble periplasmic protein [70]. 
These enzymes share about 20% sequence identity 
with their E. coli homologue, but they have more 
oxidizing power [32]. The primary sequences of the 
three neisserial proteins DsbA1, DsbA2 and DsbA3 
are similar, but some variances in the active-site 
domain which may underline the distinct properties 
of each protein were found [70]. The phenotypic 
differences observed between the three neisserial 
DsbAs are probably related to differences in substrate 
specificity and gene regulation [32]. Tinsley et al. 
found that the one or both of membrane-bound DsbA 
enzymes (DsbA1 and DsbA2) are essential for 
growth under reducing condition and for the 
biogenesis of functional type IV pili which are 
needed for interaction of the bacteria with their 
human host. The results of their studies were that the 
presence of at least one of the two membrane-bound 
enzymes is necessary to obtain wild type phenotype, 
the third enzyme (DsbA3) being incapable of 
supporting the required disulfide oxidoreductase 
activities. The explanation of its different properties 
is not clear. It might be because DsbA3 is specialized 
only for narrow group of preferred substrates [70]. 
Another observation was carried out by Sinha et al. 
Pathogenicity of Neisseria is dependent on the 
expression of membrane proteins complex the type 
IV pili. One of these membrane proteins is the 
secretin PilQ. Type IV pili are very important for 
interactions with the host cell. The absence of both 
DsbA1 and DsbA2 resulted in reduced levels of 
PilQ confirming its inefficient folding. Because 
secretin PilQ is involved in DNA binding and 
transport as well as pilus biogenesis, the reduced 
DNA uptake was also found. The lack of DsbA1 
and DsbA3 cannot be compensated by 
overexpression of DsbA3 [57]. 
Yersinia pestis 
The Yersinia genus includes 15 species, but only 
three of them are pathogenic to humans. Yersinia 
pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica cause 
nonfatal gastrointestinal disease and are transmitted 
by the food-borne route [77]. Y. pestis is causative 
agent of deadly disease plaque. Plague is enzootic in 
rodent, humans are sometimes infected for example 
by fleabites, throught handling infectious animal 
tissues or by inhalation of aerosolized bacteria. Most 
cases are bubonic plague. Patients have a fever and swollen, necrotic lymph node called bubo. Other type 
of plague is septicemic, in which bacteria circulate 
in blood and pneumonic with pulmonary infiltrates 
and cough [5]. We know about three pandemics of 
plague that were recorded in human history and 
claimed hundreds of thousands of lives [44]. Y . pestis 
is a member of category A of potential biological 
weapons, which includes agents that can be easily 
disseminated or transmitted from person to person 
resulting in high mortality rates [31]. 
One of the known proteins associated with 
virulence of Y . pestis is the envelope antigen F1. This 
antigen is encoded by plasmid-located gene caf1 [14] 
and its expression is mediated by periplasmic 
molecular chaperone Caf1M. The caf1M (caf1 
mediator) gene has homology with the chaperone 
protein PapD of E. coli [13] so it is supposed that 
product of caf1M gene is involved in biogenesis of 
antigen F1. Caf1M is a member of chaperone 
subfamily where deputies contain two cysteine 
residues with the potential of forming a disulfide 
bond in the putative binding pocket. The other 
characteristic feature is the chaperoning of a very 
simple structure surface organells sometimes 
associated with virulence [68]. It was established that 
disulfide bond between cysteine residues is not 
necessary for stabilization of Caf1M structure, but is 
important for the fine structure of the binding site, 
where binding of the capsular subunit Caf1 by the 
Caf1M chaperone takes place, thus for its function. 
It was uncovered that DsbA can control right folding 
of Caf1M through its chaperone-like activity but it is 
also capable of affecting the binding properties of 
Caf1M through its oxidative activity [76]. The 
periplasmic disulfide isomerase DsbA is essential for 
Caf1M activity [46]. 
The other plasmid-encoded virulence proteins are 
termed Yops ( Yersinia outer membrane proteins), 
which are secreted through the bacterial inner and 
outer membrane by type III secretion mechanism 
[39]. The Y . pestis type III secretion system is created 
by several genes. One of the important genes for Yop 
secretion is yscC [38]. YscC contains four carboxyl- 
terminal cysteine residues and forms two 
intramolecular disulfide bonds. One disulfide bond 
is between Cys551 and Cys576 and the second one 
is between Cys591 and Cys598. Both predicted 
disulfide bonds are important for stable production 
of YscC, but only disruption of disulfide bond 
between Cys551 and Cys576 induces the function of 
YscC in Yop secretion. DsbA appears to be necessary 
for formation of two disulfide bonds in YscC because 
YscC is accessible to proteolytic degradation in the 
Y . pestis dsbA mutant. [27]. 
123 Senitkova et al.: The disulfide bond formation and its relationship to bacterial pathogenicity Francisella tularensis 
Gram-negative facultative intracellular 
pathogen F. tularensis is one of the most 
infectious organisms known. Following the 
terrorist attacks in 2001 and subsequent mailing 
of anthrax there has been a refreshed interest in 
this organism [43]. F. tularensis is a causative 
agent of zoonotic disease called tularemia. It is a 
natural focused disease which can be transmitted 
from animal to human. For its extreme virulence, 
low infectious dose and ability to cause severe 
disease, it was classified as a member of category 
A of potential biological weapon [31]. 
F. tularensis is divided into four subspecies 
where only two are clinically important. F. 
tularensis subsp. tularensis (also called type A) 
is the most virulent, less than 10 CFU can cause 
fatal disease without treatment with appropriate 
antibiotics [12]. F. tularensis subsp. holarctica is 
less virulent, the infection dose less than 10 3CFU 
is able to cause disease which is protracted and 
very exhausting [63]. A main route of F. 
tularensis transmission to animals and humans is 
via arthropod vectors such as ticks and biting 
flies. Infection can also be transmitted through 
contaminated water and food or through handling 
infected animals or cadavers [9]. F. tularensis 
also can be aerosolized and very quickly 
disseminated, which is the most dangerous way 
in context of terrorist attacks [34]. Nowadays we 
know certain genes utilized by F. tularensis 
during infection within the host [43], but plenty 
of information about its pathogenesis and 
virulence remain unknown. 
Thakran et al. in their studies identified a 
specific Francisella product capable of 
stimulating the toll-like receptors (TLR2/TLR1 
heterodimer) [67]. These receptors are expressed 
on the host cell surface or in the endosomal 
compartments where they are able to detect 
products from bacteria, viruses, yeast and 
protozoans [62]. One of the proteins found was 
triacylated lipoprotein encoded by the gene 
ftt1103 [67]. This protein FTT1103 shares some 
similarity to DsbA proteins so it should be found 
in periplasm [49]. FTT1103 contains -CXXC- 
domain [42] and also has a disulfide- 
oxidoreductase activity [60]. The deletion mutant 
for the gene ftt1103 was attenuated in in vivo and 
in vitro models and provides a protection against 
infection caused by the fully virulent wild type 
strain. The mutant strain was found to be 
defective in intracellular growth and replication in host cell/macrophages and in J774A.1 cells 
(mouse BALB/c monocyte macrophages) there 
was a decreased ability to escape the phagosome. 
Therefore approximately 25% of ftt1103 mutant 
appeared to be able to escape to the cytoplasm, 
which can facilitate a better antigen presentation 
and a more intense adaptive immunity response. 
These studies were conducted with F. tularensis 
subsp. tularensis strain Schu S4 [49] and with 
subsp. holarctica strain FSC155 and strain 
FSC200 [60]. Effect of protein FTT1103 seems 
to be indirect through its substrates. Searching for 
putative substrates of FTT1103 has recently been 
conducted. As a putative substrates of protein 
FTT1103 several proteins including five 
hypothetical proteins, the serine-type D-alanyl- 
D-alanin carboxypeptidase and chitinase family 
18 protein were found. These proteins were 
determined in studies which used comparative 
proteome analysis of enriched membrane protein 
fractions isolated from parental strain FSC200 
and strain with deletion in ftt1103 gene [60]. The 
hypothetical proteins do not show any homology 
to known bacterial proteins found in accessible 
databases so it is difficult to predict their 
function. D-alanyl-D-alanin carboxypeptidase 
family includes bacterial enzymes bound in 
membrane. These enzymes catalyzed final 
reactions in biosynthesis of bacterial surface and 
are inhibited by beta-lactame antibiotics [48]. 
This type of serine carboxypeptidase was found 
to be Brucella abortus virulence factor [30]. 
Chitinases play an important role for vector-host 
transmission of arthropode-borne parasites [71] 
and it might play a role in F. tularensis 
pathogenesis and virulence because F. tularensis 
is an arthropod-borne bacterium [45]. 
Other Dsb-like protein was identified to be 
involved in F. tularensis virulence [63]. The F. 
tularensis strain Schu S4 protein encoded by 
ftt0107c shares about 55% similarity to DsbB 
proteins. DsbB-like activity of protein FTT0107c 
was confirmed by complementation of E. coli 
dsbB mutant phenotype [51]. Previously it was 
described that Schu S4 transposon insertion 
mutant in ftt0107c is defective in intracellular 
survival in the hepatic cell line HepG2 [50]. 
Another effect of mutation of ftt0107c gene was 
a high attenuation of mutant by intranasal route 
of inoculation in a mice model of infection. It 
means that protein FTT0107c is required for in 
vivo virulence. Therefore intranasal 
immunization with ftt0107c mutant does not 
protect C57BL/6 mice against intranasal wild- 
124 Senitkova et al.: The disulfide bond formation and its relationship to bacterial pathogenicity type challenge [51], which is in contrast with 
results obtained in a study provided by Tempel et 
al . with Francisella novicida [64]. And finally, 
the locus ftt0107c is transcribed in an operon with 
genes encoding a RND-type efflux pump, but 
deletion of the genes which encode this efflux 
pump did not affect intracellular growth and in 
vivo virulence [49]. 
CONCLUSION 
It has been known for years that formation of 
disulfide bonds is essential for correct function of 
many proteins and especially for proteins occurring in membrane or for proteins determinated for 
secretion. The E. coli has the best explored disulfide 
formation mechanism and that is why it is usually 
used as a model organism. But with onward research 
it is clear that the disulfide formation is not identical 
for all bacteria. It seems that this part of bacterial 
equipment varies significantly. 
One of the reasons why the mechanism of 
disulfide bond formation is studied lies in its 
connection with pathogenesis and virulence of many 
known pathogens. The majority of important 
antigens contains disulfide bonds and their proper 
formation is necessary for protein function. On the 
other hand we know homologues for Dsb proteins 
but we are not familiarized with their substrates, 
potential virulence factors.

This review is focused on three pathogens, N. 
meningitidis , Y. pestis and F. tularensis ,
possessing Dsb system (Table 1). Infections 
caused by these human pathogens can be very 
serious and can lead to death. So far we do not 
know all about their virulence factors, but this 
knowledge is absolutely crucial for development 
of new antibiotic drugs or vaccines. The studies 
of Dsb-like proteins and their substrates have 
contributed to identification of important proteins 
and putative virulence factors in recent years. 
Some of the detected proteins play a role in 
intracellular survival for example, while others 
are involved in forming of protein complexes 
required for host-pathogen interaction and so on. 
Plenty of new information about bacterial 
virulence are still waiting to be discovered and a 
investigation of Dsb-like proteins and their 
substrates appears to be the step in the right 
direction. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
