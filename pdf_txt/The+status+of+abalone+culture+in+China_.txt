Hybridization is an eﬀ ective way of improving germplasm in abalone, as it often generates benign traits in the
hybrids. The hybrids of Haliotis discus hannai andH. gigantea have shown heterosis in terms of disease resistance
than one or both parental species. In the present study, to elucidate the physiological and molecular mechanism
of this heterosis, we analyzed the dynamic changes of several immune indexes including survival rate, total
circulating haemocyte count (THC), phagocytic activity, reactive oxygen species level (ROS) and phenoloxidaseactivity (PO) in two parental species, H. discus hannai (DD) and H. gigantea (GG), and their reciprocal hybrids H.
discus hannai ♀×H. gigantea ♂(DG), H. gigantea ♀×H. discus hannai ♂(GD) challenged with a mixture of
Vibrio harveyi ,V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus (which have been demonstrated to be pathogenic to
abalone). Besides, we cloned and analyzed three important immune genes: heat shock protein 70 ( hsp70 ),ferritin
and cold shock domain protein ( csdp)i nH. discus hannai andH. gigantea , then further investigated their mRNA
level changes in the four abalone genotypes after bacterial challenge. Results showed that these physiologicaland molecular parameters were signi ﬁcantly induced by bacterial exposure, and their changing patterns were
obviously di ﬀerent between the four genotypes: (1) Survival rates of the two hybrids were higher than both
parental species after bacterial exposure; (2) DG had higher THC than the other three genotypes; (3)Phagocytosis responded slower in the hybrids than in the parental species; (4) DD's ROS level was lower than theother three genotypes at 48 h post infection; (5) Phenoloxidase activity was lower in DD during the infection
compared to the other genotypes; (6) mRNA levels of hsp70 andcsdp, were always lower in at least one parental
species (DD) than in the hybrids after the bacterial exposure. Results from this study indicate that the hybrids are
more active or eﬃcient in immune system function, hence they could eﬀ ectively defense against a bacterial
invasion, leading to higher survival rates after challenge. This study provides physiological and molecularevidences for interpreting the disease resistant heterosis in this abalone hybrid system, which could help us in abetter understanding and utilization of heterosis in abalone aquaculture.
1. Introduction
Abalone is a high economically valued marine species around the
world because of its high nutritive value and exceptional delicacy. It is
an important economical maricultural species cultured worldwide, and
China is the leading abalone producing country [1,2] . Based on the food
and agriculture organization (FAO) statistical data, the abalone aqua-culture production of China reached 127,967 tons in 2015, which ac-
counted for 90.20% of the world's production (FAO FishStat J 2015)
[3]. Although abalone aquaculture is a huge industry in China, pro-
blems still exist, one of them is a decrease in abalone genetic diversitybrought by repeated inbreeding, which would lead to abalone's germ-plasm decline. Several disease outbreaks happened in China abalone
industry during the past few years, resulting in severe economic losses
[4,5] . To solve this problem, scientists and abalone producers were
prompted to investigate the methods of abalone genetic improvement,hybridization breeding has been proven to be one e ﬀective approach.
Heterosis, or hybrid vigour, refers to a biological phenomenon that
hybrids often show advantages in growth, ﬁtness, or yield relative to
their parental species [6]. Heterosis is a widespread phenomenon in
plants and animals [6,7] , it has been utilized in agriculture and aqua-
culture for several years [7–10]. Due to abalone's external reproductive

Tstrategy, hybridization between abalone species naturally occurs in the
ocean [11]. Artiﬁcial hybridization between abalone species started 50
years ago [12], intraspeci ﬁc hybrids (such as hybrids from di ﬀerent
ecotypes of Haliotis diverscolor [13,14] and H. discus hannai [15]), and
interspeci ﬁc hybrids (such as hybrids of H. gigantea andH. discus hannai
[16],H. discus hannai andH. fulgens [17]) were produced. Some of these
abalone hybrids showed advantages towards their parental species ingrowth, disease resistance, or other market-favored traits (color, taste,
amino acid content, etc) [18]. In our practice, we introduced H. gi-
gantea , which was reported to be more resistant to thermal stress and
disease than H. discus hannai [19], into China, next we did hybridiza-
tion between H. gigantea and H. discus hannai , to improve the latter's
seed quality [20]. A better disease resistant ability in the hybrids was
observed and proved by our ﬁeld trial and in vitro bacterial challenge
experiments [20–22]. After 19 months' growing under the same con-
ditions in abalone farm (from 7, April, 2007 to 8, November, 2008), thesurvival rates of DD, GG, DG and GD were separately 51.83%, 88.45%,
90.33% and 92.34% [20]. When injected or immersed with pathogenic
bacteria, DG and GD also had signi ﬁcant higher survival rates than DD
[21; This study]. While the hybridization technique has been success-
fully utilized in abalone breeding, the physiological and molecular
mechanisms underlying abalone heterosis remains unclear.
Resistance to pathogens is one of the most important traits in aba-
lone aquaculture as it determines abalone's survival rate during pro-
duction and directly in ﬂuences the ﬁnal yield [23]. Like other in-
vertebrates, abalone only has innate immune function [24], which is
composed of cellular and humoral immune functions [25]. Cellular
immune response is mainly conducted by haemocytes through a seriesof processes including chemotaxis, recognition, attachment, phagocy-
tosis, and respiratory burst to eliminate foreign particles [26]. While
humoral immune function is mainly conducted by various immune-related enzymes located in haemocytes and hemolymph including su-
peroxide dismutase (SOD), phenoloxidase (PO), lysozyme, etc [27,28] .
Total haemocyte count (THC), phagocytic activity, reactive oxygen
species level (ROS), SOD and PO activities are widely used immune-
related parameters, they could re ﬂect
 invertebrate's resistant ability
against pathogens, and their level changes have been proven to be
closely related to the genetic characteristics and physiological status of
organisms, also to the external environmental factors [29–33].
Underlying the invertebrate's physi ological immune functions are var-
ious regulatory molecules, they are synthesized from, or controlled by a
wide range of immune-related genes [25], among which heat shock protein
70 (hsp70 ),ferritin ,a n dc o l d - s h o c kp r o t e i n( csdp)h a v eb e e np r o v e nt ob e
important genes. The participation of hsp70 in invertebrate immune re-
sponses has been observed in various invertebrate species [34–40],hsp70 is
regarded as an activator of the invertebrate innate immune systems
[34–36].ferritin levels vary during or after pathogen challenges in di ﬀerent
marine invertebrates such as ark shell [41],a b a l o n e [42,43] ,s h r i m p [44],
clam [45],c r a b [46],a n ds c a l l o p [47,48] , thus suggesting its role in the
invertebrate innate immune system. It is suggested that ferritin regulates the
free iron level in the host to defend bacteria, as iron is the essential element
for most bacteria to maintain their normal physiological functions [49].
csdp, featured by its biological function in the cold adaption, its involvement
in mollusk's response to cold stress has been studied in two scallop species
[50,51] . Recently, csdphas been proven to a ﬀect the immune functions of
organisms as well, it is speculated to play a role in in ﬂammation phase and
neuroin ﬂammation [52–54].csdp f u n c t i o n sa sam o l e c u l a rc h a p e r o n ei n
organisms and regulates the transcription and translation of various genes[55], including those related to immune responses. However, the role of
csdpin invertebrate immune system remains unknown.
To better understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms un-
derlying the resistance heterosis in abalone, in this study, we investigatedthe reactions of the H. gigantea, H. discus hannai and their reciprocal hybrids
to the exposure to a mixture of pathogenic Vibrio spp, their survival rates
post infection, changes in physiological immune parameters levels, and
transcription patterns of the above-mentioned genes were identi ﬁed.2.
Materials and methods
2.1. Abalones
Two species of abalone, H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (GG), and
their reciprocal hybrids H. discus hannai ♀×H. gigantean ♂(DG), H.
gigantean ♀×H. discus hannai ♂(GD), were used in this study, they
were at the same age (3 years) and similar in size (shell length7.19 ± 0.43). For each genotype, 100 individuals were used. Abalones
were collected from the Fuda Abalone Company (Jinjiang, China) and
acclimated under the same culture conditions (24 ± 1 °C, 33 ‰sali-
nity, and 7.8 pH) for 14 days prior to experimentation. Abalones werefed with fresh red alga ( Gracilaria lemaneiformis ), the seawater was re-
placed every day.
2.2. Tissues sampling for hsp70, ferritin, and csdp cloning

discus hannai (hsp70 andferritin have been cloned in H. discus hannai before
[35,42] ,csdphas not been cloned in abalone species yet), ﬁve tissues (gill,
mantle, muscle, hemolymph and visceral mass) of the two species were
collected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C.
2.3. Bacterial challenge, survival rate observation and tissue sample
collection
Three species of vibrios: Vibrio harveyi ,V. alginolyticus , and V.
parahaemolyticus were used in the bacterial challenge, which were
previously isolated from moribund abalone and demonstrated to be
virulent to abalone [56,57] .
30 abalones from each genotype were used to assess survival rate
post bacterial challenge. Abalones were immersed with seawater con-taining a mixture of the three vibrios (in the same proportion) at a
concentration of 1 × 10
9CFU/mL and then reared under 24 °C. At 0 h
(control), 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h after exposure, survival rates of thefour genotypes were recorded, abalones reared in seawater without
bacteria addition were used as the control group.

were immersed with the same vib rios at a concentration of 1 × 10
7CFU/
mL (which had been demonstrated to be the sub-lethal concentration in ourprevious unpublished experiment), and then reared under 24 °C. At 0 h
(control), 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h after exposure, 6 abalones from each gen-
otype were sampled for their hemolymph for cellular and humoral immune
parameters determination, the h emolymph was placed on ice. At 0 h

snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C, the hemolymph was
centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min to collect circulating haemocytes, the su-pernatant was discarded, and the remaining was snap-frozen in liquid ni-
t r o g e na n ds t o r e da t −80 °C.
2.4. Total circulating haemocytes count (THC) determination
THC was determined using SYBR green I (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), a
ﬂuorescent dye that binds to double-stranded DNA. 200 μL of fresh
hemolymph was ﬁxed with an equal volume of 3% formalin solution.
Fixed circulating haemocytes were incubated with 1,000x SYBR green Ifor 120 min in the dark at room temperature before running in a ﬂow
cytometer. The circulating haemocytes stained with SYBR green I werediﬀerentiated from other particles in the hemolymph based on green
ﬂuorescence (FL-1 detector) of ﬂow cytometer [58].
2.5. Phagocytosis assay
200μL of fresh hemolymph was centrifuged at 780 g for 10 min.S. Liang et al. Fish and Shellfish Immunology 72 (2018) 679–689
680Pelleted circulating haemocytes were resuspended in ﬁltered sterile sea-
water (FSSW). Then, 30 μLo fﬂuorescent beads (Polysciences Fluoresbrite
YG Microspheres, 2.00 μm,ﬁnal concentration: 0.3% of the commercial
suspension) were added to each tube. After 120 min incubation at 18 °C,

reaction. The percentage of phagocyt ic cells equals to the percentage of
circulating haemocytes that had engulfed more than three beads revealed
byﬂow cytometer analysis based on FITC ﬂuorescence [59]. 200 μLo f
FSSW mixed with 30 μLﬂuorescent beads was used as reagent control.
2.6. Reactive oxygen species level
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of circulating haemocytes
was measured according to a previous study [60] using 2 ′7′-dichloro-
ﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). 400 μL of fresh hemolymph was mixed
with 4 μLo fD C F H - D A( ﬁnal concentration: 0.01 mM) and then incubated at18 °C for 120 min. When di ﬀused into the cells, DCFH-DA was hydrolyzed
to 2′7′-dichloroﬂ uorescein (DCFH), thereby trapped within the cells. Then,
the intracellular DCFH was oxidized to highly ﬂuorescent 2 ′7′-dichloro-
ﬂuorescein by mostly H 2O2and related superoxide species. After 1 h of
incubation, DCF ﬂuorescence, quantitatively related to the ROS production
of haemocytes, was measured at 500 –530 nm by ﬂow cytometry. DCF
ﬂuorescence was expressed in arbitrary units (A.U.).
2.7. Phenoloxidase (PO) activity
Phenoloxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by re-
cording the formation of dopachr ome produced from l-dihydrox-
yphenylalanine (L-DOPA; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) [61]. The assay was con-
ducted in 96-well microplate, 100 μL fresh hemolymph was mixed with
50μL L-DOPA (0.5 mg/mL in PBS) and incubated for 30 min at 26 °C,
followed by measurement of absorba nce at 490 nm. The phenoloxidase
activity was expressed as the OD 490 value representing dopachrome for-
mation.
2.8. ESTs of hsp70, ferritin, csdp, rapid ampli ﬁcation of cDNA ends
(RACE) and cDNA sequence analysis
Total RNA was extracted from H. discus hannai andH. gigantea tissues
using the TRIpure reagent (Invitrogen, USA) in an RNase-free environment.
RNA was extracted from 50 mg of the gill, mantle, muscle, hemolymph and
visceral mass separately, then equally mixed for RACE use. Paired degen-
erate primers for hsp70 ,ferritin ,a n dcsdp (Table 1, designated as deg hsp70 ,
degferritin ,a n dd e g csdp) were designed to obtain ESTs of these genes. Based
on the ESTs obtained, gene-speci ﬁcp r i m e r s( Table 1 , named as gsp hsp70 ,
gspferritin ,a n dg s p csdp) were designed to amplify their cDNA ends, then
RACE was conducted using a SMART RAC E cDNA synthesis Kit (Clontech,
USA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Homologous analysis of sequence was conducted using online BLAST
program ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ), open reading frames
analysis was conducted using ORF ﬁnder ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gorf/orﬁ g.cgi), amino acid sequence analysis was conducted using Pfam
(http://pfam.janelia.org ), multiple sequence alignment was completed
using CLUSTALX ( http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/ ), and phylogenetic
trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method as provided inMEGA ( http://www.megasoftware.net ).Table 1

6812.9. Real-time PCR analysis of three genes in the four genotypes of abalones
after infection
The EST sequences obtained were almost the same in the four
genotypes, based on the region where the four genotypes shared 100%same sequence (no SNPs), paired real-time PCR primers ( Table 1,
named as rt hsp70 ,r tferritin , and rt csdp) were designed using Beacon
Designer ( http://www.premierbiosoft.com/molecular_beacons );β-
actin was used as an internal control as described previously [62]. The
real-time PCR experiment was conducted in a 7500 fast qPCR system
(ABI, USA). The reaction system contained 1 mL of cDNA (10-times
diluted), 1 mL of each primer (10 pmol/L) and 10 mL of 2 × DyNAmo
ColorFlash Master Mix (Thermo, USA). The cycling parameters used
were: 95 °C for 7 min, 35 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, and 60 °C for 1 min.
Theﬂuorescent signal intensities were recorded at the end of each
cycle. Melting curve analysis was performed from 60 °C to 95 °C withcontinuous ﬂuorescence reading every 0.5 °C to ensure the uniformity
of the ampli ﬁcation. The relative mRNA level of target genes was cal-
culated based on the Ct values of this gene and β-actin normalized to
that of the cDNA standard.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as the mean ± SD. Analysis of all data was
performed using SPSS 16.0 ( http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/
technology/spss ). For the bacteria-survival experiment, Kaplan-Meier sur-
vival analysis with statistical estimators (log-rank, breslow and tarone-ware)
was conducted to compare the statistical di ﬀerences among survival rates of
diﬀerent genotypes. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the general
i m p a c t so fi n f e c t i o nl e n g t h( 0h ,6h ,1 2h ,2 4h ,a n d4 8h ) ,g e n o t y p e( D D ,
GG, DG, and GD) and their interaction on immune parameter levels and
immune gene transcription. Then, within a certain time point (0 h, 6 h,
12 h, 24 h or 48 h), or within a certain genotype (DD, GG, DG or GD), one-
way ANOVA followed by least signi ﬁcant di ﬀerence (LSD) analysis was used
to compare the immune index level or gene mRNA level di ﬀerences among
diﬀerent genotypes or among di ﬀerent exposure lengths.
3. Results
cDNA sequences of hsp70 ,ferritin ,csdp, and their sequence analysis
were provided in the supplement information.
3.1. Kaplan –Meier survival curves of abalones after bacterial exposure
During the 48 h after exposure, no dead abalone was found in the
control group, while signi ﬁcant deaths were observed in bacteria
challenged abalones. Kaplan-Meier test showed that there were sig-
niﬁcant di ﬀerences in survival rates between di ﬀerent genotypes
(Fig. 1 ,Table 2): DD's survival rate was signi ﬁcantly
lower than the
other three genotypes, GG's survival rate was signi ﬁcantly lower than
DG but not GD, while DG and GD were not signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent in
survival rate. Speci ﬁcally, at 6 h, no death occurred except in DD
genotype. As exposure time increased, all the four genotypes started to
die at di ﬀerent degrees. At the end of the exposure experiment (48 h),
DD showed the lowest survival rate, 60%, while survival rates of GG,DG and GD were respectively 80%, 96.67% and 90%.Table 2

6823.2. Cellular and humoral parameters
No abalone was dead during the sub-lethal bacterial exposure.
While two-way ANOVA analysis showed signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences in the
immune parameters levels between di ﬀerent genotypes or exposure
lengths ( Table 3, Figs. 2– 5).
3.2.1. THC
The THC variation patterns in the four genotypes are shown in
Fig. 2. At 0 h, THC of DG was signi ﬁcantly higher than that of the other
three genotypes, while DD had the lowest THC. At 12 h after exposure,
DG got a dramatic increase in THC, compared to the other three gen-
otypes. At 24 h and 48 h, DG's THC decreased signi ﬁcantly, while DD'sTHC increased steadily and peaked at 48 h. THC of GG and GD wererelatively steady during the whole exposure period.
3.2.2. Phagocytic ability
Haemocytes' 2-hours phagocytosis rate of ﬂuorescent beads were
used to represent haemocytes' phagocytic ability. Changes of phago-
cytosis ability in the four genotypes during the 48 h are shown in Fig. 3.
Circulating haemocytes' phagocytic ability of all the four genotypesstarted to increase as the exposure started. In DD and GG genotypes,
haemocytes' phagocytic ability were highest at 12 h and then started to
decrease in the next 36 h, while in DG and GD genotypes, haemocytes'
phagocytic ability kept increasing for 24 h, and then fell back to the
initial value at 48 h.

4. Discussion
Disease resistance is one of the most important traits of aquaculture
species as it is linked directly to the ﬁnal yield [63]. This trait had been
proven to be improved through hybridization in many aquatic species
[63–65]. For example, compared to their parents, the hybrids of H.
gigantea and H. discus hannai were more superior in survival rate (in
natural or arti ﬁcial cultural habitat), or improved their resistance to a
certain disease. A signi ﬁcantly higher antibacterial activity was also
found in the hybrid of greenlip abalone H. laevigate and blacklip aba-
lone H. rubra [66], however, the hybrid of H. rufescens and H. discus
hannai did not show heterosis for non-susceptibility to the intracellular
rickettsial-like bacterium “Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis ”(WS-
RLOs) that causes Withering Syndrome [67]. Hence, hybridization be-
tween abalone species does not always bring disease resistance het-
erosis
into the hybrids, it may depend on the genetic characteristics of
the parental species or the cross combinations.
In our previous investigation, the reciprocal hybrids of H. discus
hannai and H. gigantea had a signi ﬁcant improvement in farm-growing
survival rate, compared to their parental species [20]. Our laboratory
test also found the hybrids to be more resistant to pathogenic bacterial(V. harveyi ,V. alginolyticus , and V. parahaemolyticus ) injection than the
parental species [52]. In this study, we changed the method of bacterial
challenge from injection to immersion, which correspond more with the
natural way that abalone gets infected. The result still supported the
heterosis, DG, GD got 26.67% and 20% improvement in survival rate
after bacterial challenge, compared to the mid-parent value (70%). This
suggests that the hybrids are more e ﬃcient in immune system re-
sponses, which may lead to a higher ability in bacteria clearance andhomeostasis maintenance. To further dissect the mechanisms under this
survival heterosis, we analyzed the changes of several immune para-
meters and molecular gene transcriptions in the four genotypes post
infection.
4.1. Non-speci ﬁc immune parameters
Haemocytes are the central cells in invertebrate innate immune
system, amount of haemocytes is regarded as an important indicator of
invertebrates' physiological immune status [25,68 –76]. Studies on im-
mune response di ﬀerences between di ﬀerent genotypes or stocks, also
gave us some information on the relationship between organisms' ge-
netics and their haemocyte responses [72,77] .
In our study, we found a close relationship of THC variation with
bacteria invasion, especially a notable elevation of THC in the hybrid:H. discus hannai ♀×H. gigantean ♂(DG). Elevation of THC upon
biotic stress was observed in invertebrates challenged with LPS [71,78] ,
virus [73], protozoa [79], this response could be caused by pathogens-
induced cellular proliferation, or rapid cellular di ﬀerentiation inresponse to antigenic challenge [71]. As the main defense cells in in-
vertebrate innate immune system, the increased circulating haemocyteswill then participate in defense against pathogenic microbes [80].I n
our study, we found DG to be di ﬀerent in THC from the other three
genotypes, it had a higher basal THC value, and its THC was more
sensitive to bacterial challenge, indicating that DG may be more active
in haemocyte-mediated immune response, this was supported by the
survival rate data (where DG got the highest survival rate during 48 h of
pathogenetic bacterial exposure). To the best of our knowledge, no
previous study has been done on the THC variations upon biotic chal-
lenge between parental species and hybrids. However, THC variations
between varied species or genotypes were analyzed, between two
shrimp species Fenneropenaeus chinensis and Marsupenaeus japonicas
[72], which were susceptible and resistant to the white spot syndrome
virus separately. M. japonicas was found to have more haemocytes than
F.
chinensis after virus injection, and correspondingly, survived a longer
time after the injection. Similarly, between two hard clam stocks, the
QPX (parasite) resistant stock NY was higher in basal THC than the
susceptible stock FL [76]. Hence, in invertebrates, concentration of
circulating haemocytes could be a positive indicator of organisms' re-sistant ability to pathogens.
In this study, induction of phagocytic ability and reactive oxygen
species production in abalone was observed after bacterial challenge,
this was consistent with studies in other invertebrates [75,77,81,85] .
Phagocytosis, together with the process of reactive oxygen species(superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxide ions and singlet
oxygen) production, played signi ﬁcant roles in invertebrate cellular
immune system [25]. They determine the organism's e ﬃciency in
eliminating foreign microorganisms. In our experiment, we found dif-
ferent changing patterns of phagocytic activity and ROS level among
the four genotypes, phagocytic activity of the two hybrids responded
slower than both parental species. Similarly, when the two species of
shrimps F. chinensis and M. japonicas were challenged with virus, their
phagocytic activity also showed a di ﬀerent changing pattern, the less
resistant species F. chinensis responded earlier (peaked at 42 h) in
phagocytosis process than M. japonicas (peaked at 78 h), hence, we
could infer that the delayed phagocytic activity in the two hybrids maycontribute to a more thorough clearance of the invading pathogens, but
this hypothesis needs more evidences to support. ROS production pat-
tern of H. discus hannai (DD) also showed di ﬀerence with the other
three genotypes, resulting in higher overall ROS levels in H. gigantea
(GG) and the two hybrids than DD, as ROS level was always positively
related to anti-pathogen ability in invertebrates [72,73,76] , GG and the
two hybrids could be stronger in their anti-bacteria abilities. To sum up,upon bacterial challenge, slower response of phagocytic activity, and
higher ROS levels (48 h) in the two hybrids, could contributed to their
higher bacterial clearance rates, resulting in higher survival rates.
Phenoloxidase, as the terminal enzyme in proPO system, acts in
invertebrate immune system by stimulating several cellular responses
including phagocytosis, nodule formation and respiratory burst [72].
Phenoloxidase activity could be activated by various pathogens, re-garded as an indicator of organism infectious state [72,74,76,81,82] .I n
our study, we observed a lower PO level in DD compared to the otherthree genotypes ( Fig. 4). PO activity comparison was also conducted in
a shrimp hybrid system [83], in that study, two parental species from
diﬀerent geographic position showed distinct PO level, while one hy-
brid had a PO level close to mid-parent value, the other hybrid's POlevel exceed the mid-parent value, suggesting that genetic variations
could re ﬂect in PO level di ﬀerences. However, that study did not in-
vestigate correlation between PO level and the shrimps' susceptibility tobiotic stress. From our result, we could infer that the two hybrids and
GG were more e ﬃcient in PO-related immune responses compared to
DD.
From our results, we could conclude that when challenged with
bacterial stress, the hybrid DG could be more active in producing orinvoking circulating haemocytes to organize immune reactions, and theS. Liang et al. Fish and Shellfish Immunology 72 (2018) 679–689
686two hybrids could be more e ﬃcient in clearance of bacteria with slower
phagocytic responses and higher ROS levels, and more active in proPO
system mediated immune responses.
4.2. Immune genes transcriptions
We observed a quick response of hsp70 after bacterial challenge in
circulating haemocytes and gills in the four abalone genotypes, which
agrees with the phenomena observed in other invertebrates. The oyster
Crassostrea gigas challenged with vibrios and LPS elevated its hsp70
mRNA levels [84], similar increasing of hsp70 transcription was also
observed in the hard clam Meretrix meretrix [85]. Besides, we observed
a faster transcription of hsp70 in heamocytes than in gills, this could be
explained by the time that these circulating haemocytes need to in-
ﬁltrate the gill, as tissue-in ﬁltrated heamocytes are known to be an-
other important immunologic function in invertebrates [86,87] . Be-
tween the four genotypes, the overall hsp70 mRNA levels were always
higher in GG and the two hybrids than in DD. As higher mRNA level ofhsp70 indicate higher ability to initiate and regulate immune functions,
combined with the survival rate experiment, we could infer that the GGand the two hybrids are more active in immune responses compared to
DD, showing heterosis.
The vital role of ferritin in invertebrate immune systems have been
highlighted in several studies, it is regarded as an acute phase reaction
protein that participates in organisms' immune responses [88,89] .A
similar ferritin transcription pattern was observed in the four genotypes,
the increase of gill ferritin at 48 h could be the result of iron competition
between host and bacteria, as iron is a necessary element for the basicsurvival of most bacterial pathogens. Therefore, contending for iron has
been regarded as the hosts' strategy to defend against invading patho-
gens [90,91] . No much ferritin transcription di ﬀerence existed between
the parents and hybrids except for a notable higher ferritin mRNA level
in the gill of H. gigantea ♀×H. discus hannai ♂(GD), indicating that GD
may be more e ﬃcient in ferritin -related immune responses than the
other genotypes.
The relationship between csdp/YB-1 proteins and organism's im-
mune functions are gaining increasing attentions in recent years. YB-1
protein could suppress transcription of the important immune gene
MHC, which is involved in the γ-interferon pathway [92]. In turbot
Scophthalmus maximus ,csdp was found to change its mRNA level after
virus and bacterial challenges [54]. As a RNA chaperone, csdp acts in
regulating the transcription and translation of various genes [55],
hence, we could infer that the involvement of csdp in
an aquatic or-
ganism's immune responses could be the result of its gene-regulatingfunction. In this study, csdpmRNA levels elevated in the gill of abalones
challenged with vibrios, and the mRNA level di ﬀerences between the
four genotypes could be correlated with the di ﬀerences in their resistant
ability: DD got the lowest csdp mRNA level, indicating that the other
three genotypes could secrete more csdpduring infection to regulate the
immune-related genes, further to obtain a greater ability to combatbacteria. However, in haemocytes, no large variations in csdp mRNA
level were observed, hence, we could infer that csdp is not a direct
immune related gene in mollusks, it acts more like a regulating mole-
cule in mollusks.
5. Conclusions
In this study, we analyzed and compared the cellular responses and
molecular responses of H. discus hannai ,H. gigantea and their hybrids to
bacterial challenge, hoping to get insights into the physiological and
molecular basis of the bacteria resistance heterosis observed in this
hybrid system. Di ﬀerent response patterns between parents and hybrids
were found. The hybrids were more vigorous in expression of immuneinitiating gene hsp70, and more active in immune-regulating enzyme
phenoloxidase. Enhanced transcription or expression of these moleculescould then in ﬂuence the downstream physiological cellular responses inthe hybrids, resulting in hybrids' higher survival rate after bacterialstress. However, the molecular basis of heterosis is complex, heterosis is
considered to originate from genetic code di ﬀerence between parental
and hybrid genotypes [6,7] , next-generation sequencings of genome,
transcriptome and epigenetics are powerful techniques that would fa-
cilitate our comprehensive understanding of heterosis phenomena and
should be applied into the future work of abalone heterosis study.
