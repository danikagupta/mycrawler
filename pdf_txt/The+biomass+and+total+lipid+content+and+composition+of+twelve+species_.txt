Diatoms contribute as a dominant group of microalgae to approximately 20% of the global
carbon ﬁxation. In the plankton, these photosynthetic algae are exposed to a plethora of
metabolites, especially when competing algae are lysed. It is well established that diatomscan take up speci ﬁc metabolites, such as vitamins, amino acids as nitrogen source, or
dimethylsulfoniopropoionate to compensate for changes in water salinity. It is, however,
unclear to which extent diatoms take up other organic resources and if these are
incorporated into the cell´s metabolism. Here, we explore the general scope of uptakeof metabolites from competitors. Using labeled metabolites released during lysis of algaegrown under a
13CO 2atmosphere, we show that the cosmopolitan diatom Chaetoceros
didymus takes up even dilute organic substrates from these lysates with little bias for
molecular weight or polarity. This is re ﬂected by a high degree of labeling in the
metabolome of the exposed cells. The newly developed pulse label/mass spectrometrymetabolomics approach reveals that polarity and molecular weight has no detectableinﬂuence on uptake. We further show that the taken-up metabolites are partly maintained
without metabolic modi ﬁcation within the cells, but also a substantial part is subject to
catabolic and anabolic transformation. One of the most dominant phytoplankton groupsthus has the potential to compete with heterotrophs, suggesting that the observedosmotrophy may substantially impact organic material ﬂuxes in the oceans. Our ﬁndings
call for the re ﬁnement of our understanding of competition in the plankton.

INTRODUCTION
The traditional view on marine plankton dist inguishes between phytoplankton as primary
producers and zooplankton as consumers ( Heesen, 1928 ). However, many planktonic eukaryotic
organisms have been recognized as mixotrophs, which combine autotrophic photosynthesis with
organic matter uptake ( Selosse et al., 2017 ). Many microzooplankton grazers are mixotrophic and
retain functional algal organelles or even algal endosymbionts. Also photosynthetically active

doi: 10.3389/fmars.2022.821167organisms, such as phyto ﬂagellates and dino ﬂagellates can engulf
and consume prey organisms to acquire nutrients ( Stoecker et al.,
2017 ). As an additional strategy, the uptake of dissolved organic
carbon termed absorbotrophic mixotrophy or osmotrophy canbe observed in microalgae. This process seems to be ubiquitousbut clearly less understood ( Flynn et al., 2013a ).
First investigations of osmotrophy in plankton focused on
algae growth under extreme darkness in the presence of organicsubstrates ( Neilson and Lewin, 1974 ). Administration and
uptake studies of radiolabeled substrates deepened ourmechanistic understanding. However, experiments were alwayslimited to investigating one compound or a compound class,
such as speci ﬁc vitamins or amino acids. It is now clear that
mixotrophy is widely distributed among planktonic eukaryoticorganisms ( Caron, 2016 ). However, the experiments with single
compounds under limiting conditions conducted so far representan oversimpli ﬁcation and do not re ﬂect the situation in nature,
where a cell is exposed to structurally more diverse metabolites.
Consequently, the importance of osmotrophy for pelagic food
webs and element cycling remains elusive and we are still farfrom quantitatively deciphering the trophic modes of primaryproducers forming the phytoplankton ( Karlusich et al., 2020 ).
The availability of organic substrates for uptake will be highly
variable. In the plankton mass occurrences of algae, so-calledalgal blooms can last over days to weeks before the population
breaks down and is succeeded by other species that become
dominant. Especially during the decay of such algal blooms, thesurviving competitors will be exposed to the metabolites of thelysed algae. Also, lysis of speci ﬁc phytoplankton members by
pathogens, such as algicidal bacteria or viruses, results insituations where surviving resistant cells are exposed to the
metabolomes released by the lysed species ( Meyer et al., 2017 ).
It is entirely unclear if and how all these compounds contributeto the metabolism of the phytoplankton and the potentialecological importance of phytoplankton as consumers oforganic material is thus still poorly understood ( Burkholder
et al., 2008 ;Flynn et al., 2013b ;Borowitzka, 2016 ;Ferroni
et al., 2018 ). Modeling studies imply a leak-recovery system to
be required to initiate a bloom, but the underlying mechanisms
are not fully explored ( Flynn et al., 2008 )
As critical primary producers, diatoms were initially classi ﬁed
as autotrophs, but the uptake capability of speci ﬁco r g a n i c
molecules has long been recognized ( Raven et al., 2009 ;Flynn
et al., 2013b ). These include glucose, small polar organic acids
such as acetate, succinate, fumarate, malate and lactate, amino
acids, dipeptides and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)(Lewin and Lewin, 1960 ;Hellebust and Guillard, 1967 ;
Hellebust and Lewin, 1972 ;Vila-Costa et al., 2006 ;Cochlan
et al., 2008 ;Mulholland and Lee, 2009 ;Spielmeyer et al., 2011 ;
Petrou and Nielsen, 2018 ). Most experiments provided
mechanistic insight but did not accurately re ﬂect natural
conditions, where the water in which the algae live harbors a
diverse mixture of organic compounds. Under naturalconditions, cells are exposed to these metabolites and also lightis available to support photosynthesis. Thus, two competingmechanisms for carbon acquisition, phototrophy andheterotrophy will be active. Here we address osmotrophy in
the diatom Chaetoceros didymus under non-limited conditions.
The supply of nutrients and light in our study was non-limitingto allow ef ﬁcient algal growth; organic metabolites were thus
offered in addition to available inorganic sources.
We base our experimental setup on a well-investigated multi-
partner interaction involving an algicidal bacterium and two
cosmopolitan diatom species. Kordia algicida is a marine
Flavobacterium that possesses algicidal activity leading to celllysis of several microalgal species, including the diatomSkeletonema costatum (Paul and Pohnert, 2011 ;Paul and
Pohnert, 2013 ).C. didymus , in contrast, is a naturally co-
occurring diatom that is resistant against K. algicida .T h e
impact of K. algicida was recently shown in ﬁeld experiments
where it induces a population shift in a natural phytoplanktoncommunity towards resistant algae ( Bigalke et al., 2019 ). We
hypothesize that during bacterial lysis of S. costatum , resistant
species can bene ﬁt by taking up metabolites of the lysate in an
osmotrophic manner. Therefore, we exposed a culture of C.
didymus to metabolites from a 50% diluted stationary culture of
lysed S. costatum cells. We developed a novel analytical approach
to test this hypothesis, including pulse labeling metabolomicsand a novel data treatment routine to analyze isotopologuesignatures. We show that highly universal uptake andmetabolism of metabolites from the environment occur in the
resistant alga.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Design
Diatoms were grown under non-limited conditions and exposed
to a labeled metabolome released by lysed cells of a competitor.The diatoms were extracted using optimized protocols formetabolomics sampling and extracts were analysed by liquidchromatography mass spectrometry to evaluate the uptake oflabeled metabolites.
Algal Culturing
C. didymus was isolated by W. Kooistra from the Gulf of Naples
(Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy) and S. costatum
was obtained from the Roscoff Culture Collection (Roscoff,France). Both algae were cultivated in batch culture usingnutrient-replete arti ﬁcial seawater medium ( Maier and
Calenberg, 1994 ) in 50 mL Greiner Bio-One cell culture ﬂasks
at 11-13°C under a 14:10 h light: dark regime with an
illumination of 20-25 μmol photons m
-2s-1. Development of
cultures was followed by in-vivo Chl aﬂuorescence using a
Mithras LB 940 plate reader (excitation 430 nm, emission665 nm).
Global13C-Labeling
For global13C-labeling of S. costatum we used autoclaved
artiﬁcial seawater medium that was prepared without addition
of NaHCO 3. An aliquot of this medium was utilized to dissolve
NaH13CO 3(98 atom %, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). ThisMeyer et al. Substrate Uptake by Marine Diatoms

concentration of 2.38 mM, was sterile ﬁltered (0.2 μm pore
size, Sarstedt Filtropur S) and transferred back to the mediumbottle. Tissue culture ﬂasks were ﬁlled to the neck in order to
minimize the area for CO
2exchange with the atmosphere and
were inoculated with < 1% (v/v) of a stationary S. costatum
culture. After growing to stationary phase, an aliquot was taken
and transferred to fresh13C-enriched medium (< 1% (v/v)).
After two of these cycles a plateau in the degree of labeling(veriﬁed by mass spectrometry as described below) was reached
and the cultures were used for further experiments.
Bacterial Culturing
K. algicida (Sohn et al., 2004 ) was cultivated on marine broth
agar at 30°C for 2 days. The bacterial lawn was removed with asterile cotton swab and re-suspended in algal culturing mediumto an OD
550of 0.5 determined on a Genesys 10S UV-Vis
spectrophotometer (Th ermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham,
MA, USA).
Co-Culturing Experiment and Extraction of
Released Metabolites
S. costatum cultures reared in medium prepared with NaHCO 3
(further referred to12Co r13C medium were co-cultured in
triplicates (185 mL each) with the K. algicida added to a ﬁnal
OD 550of 0.01. After 6 days the lysed cultures were gently ﬁltered
(0.2 μm pore size) and the ﬁltrate extracted for exometabolome
analysis as follows. Solid phase extraction cartridges(Chromabond easy, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) wereequilibrated with 4 mL of methanol (Chromasolv Plus, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and 4 mL of water (Chromasolv
Plus, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) before the ﬁltrate (170
mL) was applied using vacuum with a ﬂow rate < 1 L h
-1. The
cartridge was washed with 4 mL water, air-dried and thenextracted viagravity ﬂow using 2 mL of methanol followed by
2 mL of methanol/tetrahydrofuran 1:1 (tetrahydrofuranHiPerSolv, VWR, Dresden, Germany). This extract was frozenuntil further chemical analysis.
Tests for Osmotrophy
Stationary cultures (45 mL) of S. costatum reared in12Co r13C
medium were centrifuged (500 x g, 15 min, 10°C) and washedthree times by repeated addition of 45 mL of
12C medium to the
harvested pellets and centrifugation. After the third washing stepthe supernatant was collected as control medium (this wasprocessed in parallel to the cells and later served as control for
the natural
13CO 2) and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 45 mL
12C medium. To disrupt cells, the suspension was frozen at
-20°C, thawed and treated in an ice-cold ultrasonic bath for 10min. The lysate was ﬁltered (1.2 μm pore size, GF/C, Whatman,
GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), acidi ﬁed to
pH≤1 for sterilization using 30% hydrochloric acid, incubated at
0°C for 10 min and subsequently neutralized under sterile
conditions using a saturated sodium hydroxide solution. Thesolutions were stored at -20°C until use. After thawing, thesolutions were diluted 1:1 with
12C medium to yield the ﬁnal
medium for the investigation of osmotrophy (12C organic &12Cinorganic or13C organic &12C inorganic). 45 mL aliquots of
both media were extracted as described above forexometabolomic analysis to determine the organic metabolites.To determine osmotrophy, 110 mL aliquots of these media wereinoculated with 1% (v/v) stationary C. didymus culture in
triplicates and cultivated for 3 days. Directly after inoculation
and after 3 days of cultivation, samples (45 mL each) for intra-
and extracellular metabolomics were processed. Samples wereﬁltered (1.2 μm, GF/C, Whatman, GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, United Kingdom) and the ﬂow-through was
processed for exometabolomic analysis as described above (seeco-culturing experiment). The cells were washed off the ﬁlter
with an ice-cold freshly prepared mixture of methanol/ethanol/
chloroform (1:3:1) (ethanol LiChroSolv, Merck, Darmstadt,Germany; chloroform HiPerSolv, VWR, Dresden, Germany).Extracts were treated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min,centrifuged (30,000 x g, 15 min, 4°C) and the supernatant wasstored at -20°C. As a control to prove that no NaHCO
3
enrichment was present in mixotrophic media, the third washsupernatant (see above) was used as medium to cultivate C.
didymus and metabolites were extracted as described. A
graphical representation of the experimental setup can befound in Supplementary Figure 1 .
Analysis of Exo- and Endometabolomes
With LC-MS
Extracts from cells and media (see above) were dried in a
nitrogen ﬂow at room temperature and were resuspended in
up to 200 μL methanol. Metabolites were separated on anUltiMate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham,
MA, USA) equipped with an Accucore C18 column(100x2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) at 25°C using water with 2% acetonitrile
and 0.1% formic acid (A) and pure acetonitrile (B) as mobile
phase. The gradient was as follows: 100% A for 0.2 min, lineargradient to 100% B in 7.8 min, 100% B for 3 min, linear gradientto 100% A in 0.1 min, 100% A for 0.9 min. The UHPLC wasconnected to a QEplus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with heated
electrospray ionization source (capillary temperature 360°C,
sheath gas 60 nominal units, aux gas 20 nominal units, sweepgas 5 nominal units, aux gas temperature 400°C, spray voltage 3.3kV, S-lens RF level 50) operated in positive or negative ion mode.Full scan measurements ( m/z100-1200, resolution 280k, AGC
target 3 10
6, maxIT 900 ms) were performed separately for
positive and negative ion mode. All data are available at
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2333.
Isotopologue Detection
Full scan RAW ﬁles were converted to mzXML using
ProteoWizard msConvert ( Kessner et al., 2008 )w i t ht h e
vendor ’s algorithm for peak picking. Isotopologue detection
was achieved with R-based X13CMS ( Huang et al., 2014 ). The
R script can be found in the Supplementary Material . In brief,
after peak-picking with centwave (3 ppm, peakwidth 5-20 s) andretention time alignment with orbiwarp, isotopologues with amass difference of 1.00335 Da were assigned (RTwindow 10 s,Meyer et al. Substrate Uptake by Marine Diatoms
Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 821167 33 ppm). Either all isotopologue groups ( a=1 )o ro n l y
isotopologue groups signi ﬁcantly different from12C(a= 0.05)
were reported. Afterwards, those signi ﬁcantly different
isotopologue groups were manually curated with reference tothe original spectrum in order to exclude groups that did notcontain at least 3 consecutive isotopologues.
Compound Identi ﬁcation
Compounds were identi ﬁed based on their retention time, high
resolution mass to charge ratio and fragmentation pattern.Compound Discoverer (Vers. 2.1, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc,
Waltham, MA, USA) was used to predict sum formula, searchan in-house and public databases (ChemSpider and mzCloud) as
well as calculate FISh scores of candidates. SIRIUS and CSI :
FingerID were used to compute fragmentation trees and searchmolecular structure databases ( Duhrkop et al., 2015 ). Putatively
identi ﬁed compounds were compared to authentic standards:
Arachidonic acid, betaine, carnitine hydrochloride, cholinechloride, 11 Z-eicosenoic acid, 2-hydroxytetradecanoic acid,
isoleucine, leucine and 1-oleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Munich, Germany). Oleic
acid was purchased from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany).Linoleic acid was from Alfa A esar (Haverhill, MA, USA).
5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-Eicosapentaenoic acid was supplied by
Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and 6 Z,9Z,12Z-
Hexadecatrienoic acid from Larodan (Solna, Sweden).
6Z,9Z,12Z,15-Hexadecatetraenoic acid has been synthesized
according to Pohnert et al. (2004) . ß-Alanine betaine has been
synthesized according to Chary et al. (2012) Leucine and
isoleucine were not baseline separated and are consequentlygrouped as (iso-)leucine.
Calculation of the Degree of Labeling
To calculate the degree of labeling MS1 data from isotopologues
are assumed to have a Bernoulli distribution (see Supplementary
Material for formula) ( Zachmann, 1994 ). Measured
isotopologue intensities are compared to computeddistributions and the squared coef ﬁcient of variation between
both is minimized in an iterative process.
RESULTS
Generation and Evaluation of a Labeled
Metabolome for Uptake Experiments
A complex medium containing the entire labeled metabolome of
lysed diatom cells could be generated from13C-labeled S. costatum .
We grew S. costatum in a medium containing NaHCO 3as a sole
carbon source to obtain a labeled metabolome. With a repeatedexchange of the medium, we reached up to 65% labeling in the algalmetabolites, suf ﬁcient for our analytical protocol. Mechanical lysis
of the labeled culture and removing the cell debris gave an axenic
medium, rich in organic metabolites ( Supplementary Figure 1 ).
We hypothesized that the resistant C. didymus encounters
these metabolites also in the ﬁeld when algicidal bacteria lyse its
competitors. To test this hypothesis, labeled S. costatum cultureswere infected with K. algicida , which resulted in lysis of more
than half of the diatom cells within six days. Ultrahigh-pressureliquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry(UHPLC-HRMS) of the exometabolome revealed similarmetabolic pro ﬁles in mechanically lysed S. costatum cells and
those lysed by the bacteria which is also re ﬂected in Table 1
where two thirds of the identi ﬁed metabolites were found in both
sample types.
Before incubation with C. didymus , the metabolites from
lysed S. costatum were sterilized and diluted with a medium
containing inorganic carbon with normal isotope distribution(1.1%
13C,Supplementary Figure 1 ). Thereby, we could ensure
that13C labeled organic metabolites taken up from the medium
can be distinguished from de novo synthesized compounds. We
exposed C. didymus to a three day pulse of labeled metabolites
released from lysed cells of S. costatum and then extracted the
culture. Pulse labeling for three days (i.e. ca. two cell divisions)instead of prolonged incubation prevents scrambling of isotopes
detected in the mass spectra due to excessive cellular metabolism
during incubation.
Following the same procedure, a control medium was
generated using S. costatum cells grown in a medium with
natural isotope distribution that could be used to generate
mass spectra for structure elucidation. Using fragmentationtrees and database comparison of the unlabeled metabolites
and subsequent comparison to authentic standards, we
identi ﬁed several of the labeled metabolites in C.
didymus (Table 1 ).
Our study is limited to the fraction of metabolites that can be
extracted and separated in UHPLC (and extracted with SPE inthe case of exometabolites) using our standardized protocols.
Thus, a broad range of metabolites is investigated, but we cannot
claim to cover the entire metabolome (which would betechnically not feasible in any metabolomics approach to date).Since we did not use a biasing extraction protocol for thegeneration of labeled medium, but rather used the cell lysateand since extraction success is identical for isotopologes and theunlabeled compounds we can conclude that our results will not
be distorted due to extraction selectivity. We did not aim for a
quanti ﬁcation of the respective metabolites in this metabolomics
approach but rather surveyed the physiochemical properties ofmetabolites taken up during exposure to organic metabolitesreleased from a lysed culture.
Evaluation of Uptake
For uptake experiments, C. didymus was cultivated in a medium
containing the sterilized labeled S. costatum endometabolome or
control medium for three days (n=3). We selected theconcentration of added metabolites to be equivalent to 50% of
those released by a lysed stationary culture. Cells were then
recovered by ﬁltration and washed ext ensively. After being
exposed to this medium under otherwise optimum growthconditions, UHPLC-HRMS analysis of the C. didymus
endometabolome revealed that the alga took up substantialamounts of labeled compounds from various metabolic classes.Quantitative analysis of labeling proved to be challenging inMeyer et al. Substrate Uptake by Marine Diatoms
Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 821167 4terms of chemoinformatic data treatment. Therefore, ions of the
same metabolite, only differing in their number of incorporated
13C were summarized in an isotopologue group using the
software X13CMS ( Huang et al., 2014 ). Of 5587 isotopologue
groups (positive and negative ionization mode) detectable in the
endometabolome 2381 were signi ﬁcantly labeled with13C
(Figure 1A ). After manual curation, 548 isotopologue groups
were categorized according to their labeling pattern and analyzedregarding their retention time and mass to charge ratio. Thedegree of labeling was estimated using the probability massfunction for Bernoulli trials (random experiments with
precisely two possible outcomes, “success i.e. incorporation of
13C”and “failure i.e. incorporation of12C“, in which the
probability of success is the same every time the experiment isconducted):
ImðÞ=n!
m! n −m ðÞ !·pm ·1−p ðÞn−m(1)
The degree of labeling p for a metabolite with n carbon atoms is
estimated from the intensities of a set of isotopologues I(m) with
m13C atoms ( Pohnert and Jung, 2003 ).
Classi ﬁcation of Taken-Up and
Processed Metabolites
We categorized the metabolites according to their degree of
labeling in the receiving cells ( Figures 1B, C ). 73% of the
isotopologue groups were lowly labeled with a degree oflabeling < 5% indicative of compounds mainly synthesized de
novo inC. didymus . The low degree of labeling that still exceeds
the natural
13C content of 1.1% can be explained by general
utilization of taken-up metabolites in the metabolism:
metabolites that are assimilated are catabolized to metabolic
building blocks that are used together with the autotrophicmetabolic pool and used for anabolism again. Seven percent of
the isotopologue groups were highly labeled. They contained adegree of labeling similar to that of metabolites in the medium(ca. 65%). The cellular content of these highly labeled metabolitestaken up from lysed S. costatum shows that C. didymus
assimilates metabolites that it does not (or only to a minimal
extent) produce itself. Certain compounds with a high degree oflabeling can be found in C. didymus but not in the DOM label-
enriched medium. These could arise from the metabolictransformation of more complex metabolites released by S.
costatum . 15% of the isotopologue groups were labeled in a
mixed manner. In the mass spectrum both, signals from a lowly
labeled and a highly labeled proportion of the respectivecompound can be detected. This pattern can be explained bymetabolites that are biosynthesized by C. didymus and also
acquired from the medium. This compound class includes awide range of natural products, from small charged moleculeslike choline and carnitine to non-polar lipids and fatty acids. A
few signals (5%) had a complex labeling pattern that Bernoulli
statistics could not describe. These can be interpreted ascompounds that result from metabolites taken up and furthermetabolized using the pool of de novo synthesized metabolites
(Figures 1B, C ). For example, intermediate metabolic products
like fatty acids can be utilized in the anabolism of more complex
ones like lipids.
Properties of Taken Up Metabolites
Labeled metabolites span a wide range of polarity from charged
small molecules to non-polar fatty acids. Most labeled productsare found in the non-polar region of the chromatogram(Figure 1D ,Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2 ). The
identi ﬁed polar metabolites that are ef ﬁciently taken up include
the amino acids leucine and/or isoleucine and several smallTABLE 1 | Labeled metabolites identi ﬁed in the endometabolome of Chaetoceros didymus .

(Figure 2A ) originate from two distinct pools ( Figure 2D ), a
lowly labeled pool from de novo biosynthesis and a highly labeled
pool from uptake. Modeling with Bernoulli statistics showed thatthede novo biosynthesis pool had a degree of labeling of 2.8%,
slightly higher than what would be expected from photosynthesis
using exclusively natural inorganic carbon ( Figure 2B ). The
highly labeled pool has a very similar isotopologue distributioncompared to the fatty acid fr om the lysed labeled alga
(Figure 2C ). Modeling a mixture of these two pools showed
that ca. 20% of the metabolite in the algae results from uptake,while 80% are synthesized de novo . This complementation of de
novo synthesized products with externally available metabolites
is observed for several metabolites with variable proportions ofthe two sources from only a few percent to nearly 80% of themetabolite acquired by uptake ( Table 1 ).
The isotopologue patterns o f metabolites that can be
explained by an uptake of resources from the medium followedby transformations within the cell using the pool of de novo
synthesized precursors are more complex. They do not follow the
Bernoulli statistics since different resources can be utilized indifferent relative amounts. An example is thelysophosphatidylcholine shown in Figure 3A . The isotope
pattern of the lipid ( Figure 3B ) cannot be interpreted with the
model described above, but tandem MS experiments allow for
dissecting the lipid. This reveals a unique labeling pattern for
those parts of the molecule that are derived from differentbiosynthetic pathways. The isotopologue pattern of oleic acidin the lysophosphatidylcholine ( Figure 3C ) can also not be ﬁtted
with a Bernoulli statistic. The fatty acid is thus assembled usingresources that were taken up as well as de novo produced. This
labeling pattern in the fatty acid moiety is also observed in free
oleic acid and 11 Z-eicosenoic acid. Lipid assembly thus does not
discriminate between acquired and de novo synthesized
resources. In contrast, the choline fragment detected in thesame substance shows that most choline is highly labeled andtherefore taken up ( Figure 3D ). The glycerol moiety of the
molecule is not giving charged fragments, but its labeling could
be established indirectly. Therefore, we conducted fragmentation
of the M+8 isotopologue of the lysophosphatidylcholine. TheMS/MS of this ion gave rise to an oleic acid fragment withisotopologues containing down to zero
13C(Figure 3E ). The
remaining eight carbon atoms in the uncharged C8-fragmenthave thus to be labeled in different degrees. The fragments can
thus only be derived from a precursor with labeled, thus
acquired glycerol.
These exemplarily discussed mass spectra stand for several
hundreds of labeled peaks in the chromatogram of theendometabolome of exposed C. didymus (see Figure 1 and
Supporting information ). Using the combined results, we can
now draw a picture of the osmotrophic metabolism in C.
didymus (Figure 4 ). The uptake introduced here for C.didymus is not limited to this one species but broader
distributed in diatoms. When the diatom Thalassiosira
weiss ﬂogiiwas raised in the labeled medium as described for C.
didymus , labeling patterns similar to those described above were
detected (data not shown).

13C Labeling Allows Tracing of Metabolic
Shuttling Between Microalgae
In order to study potential osmotrophy in the diatom C. didymus
a medium rich in13C labeled organic metabolites was prepared
by mechanical lysis of a globally labeled S. costatum culture and
removal of the cell debris by ﬁltration. We diluted this ﬁltrate to
reach concentrations for all i ndividual compounds in the
incubation that correspond to 50% of those found in astationary, lysed culture. Given the fact that bacterial lysis ofphytoplankton in the lab and ﬁeld happens within hours and that
entire blooms of algae can be lysed, we conclude that the
concentrations employed are in the range of those found
during lysis of a dense bloom ( Bigalke et al., 2019 ). The
employed concentrations will nevertheless be higher thanunder natural non-bloom conditions. However, we observeduptake of metabolites irrespective of their relativeconcentration in the extract. Not only abundant metabolites
were found to be labeled and therefore acquired compounds.
Also, minor and trace signals in the chromatograms indicatedthe incorporation of labels. Given the sensitivity of the massspectrometer with detection limits in the femptomolar range, thisindicates that the uptake mechanism is not driven by theconcentration of the metabolites in the water and does thusnot result from a “force-feeding ”ofC. didymus .
The resulting metabolome enriched medium showed a
similar (but labeled) metabolic pro ﬁle as the medium of an
infection experiment where the lytic bacterium K. algicida lysed
S. costatum . We thus conclude that K. algicida is a sloppy feeder
not utilizing the entire algal metabolome but instead leavingsubstantial organic resources that it does not require or recover
in the water. Surviving algae, such as the resistant competitor C.didymus will be exposed to these metabolites. Earlier, we
observed that such exposure to metabolites released from lysedalgae supports the growth of C. didymus if administered at low
concentrations. However, no information about the underlyingmechanism was available ( Bigalke and Pohnert, 2019 ). The
ability to take up released organic molecules may
counterbalance the m etabolic costs to maintain resistance
mechanisms and would be highly advantageous, for example,during the collapse of a competing algal bloom as simulated inthis study ( Sohn et al., 2004 ;Meyer et al., 2017 ).
In addition to the release of organic material upon cell lysis,
intact algae can also be a source of dissolved metabolites. Fieldstudies indicate that natural phytoplankton communities can
release 20 to 40% of newly assimilated dissolved inorganic
nitrogen in form of dissolve d organic nitrogen into the
environment ( Flynn and Berry, 1999 ). Also, secretion of
dissolved organic carbon e.g., in the form of mucus-formingsaccharides is well-documented ( Alderkamp et al., 2007 ). If the
metabolic uptake also functions in such situations or phases
w h e r ed i l u t ep h y t o p l a n k t o n abundance results in low
concentrations of dissolved metabolites would have to beveriﬁed in follow-up studies. Future work focusing on the
quanti ﬁcation of selected metabolites could support uptake
mechanisms and kinetics. We have, however, no indicationfrom the analysis of labeling that there would be a bias for theuptake of higher concentrated metabolites.
We reached up to 65% labeling in the S. costatum metabolome
using repeated exchange of medium containing NaHCO
3as an
exclusive carbon source. Higher degree of labeling might bereached in gas-tight culturing devices after more generation ofculturing, but was not required for the present study. Analysis oftheC. didymus endometabolome after being exposed to the labeled

Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 821167 9growth conditions revealed that the alga took up substantial
amounts of labeled compounds from various metabolic classes.Given that analysis of every single isotopologue of a labeledmetabolite would generate highly complex and partiallyredundant information, we reverted to a statistical treatmentassuming that labeling results in an isotopologue distribution in
MS1 data that can be described with a Bernoulli statistic. In the
Bernoulli trial a random experiment with exactly two possibleoutcomes is evaluated. In this case “success ”would represent the
incorporation of
13Ca n d “failure ”that of12C. We estimate that
excess substrate is present, thus the probability of success is thesame every time a carbon is incorporated. This data treatment
allowed to match labeling patterns to predicted spectra that would
result from speci ﬁc degrees of labeling. Thereby the average 65%
labeling of the S. costatum metabolome could be determined.
Labeling Patterns of Metabolites in
C. didymus After Exposure to13C-Labeled
S. costatum Extract
Analysis of the endometabolome of the resistant alga C. didymus
after exposure to metabolites from13C-labeled S. costatum
revealed unlabeled metabolites, metabolites with unaltered fulllabeling and those with more complex mass spectra that could beassigned to different metabolic processing ( Figure 1 ). The
methodology described here thus not only shows the uptake of
one metabolite, but allows simultaneous quanti ﬁcation of the
uptake and analysis of the me t a b o l i cf a t eo fa l lt a k e nu p
metabolites in the receiving alga. This is a valuable expansionof the classical ﬂuxomics approach, where feeding of one single
labeled metabolite to heterotrophs can only reveal its uptake and
metabolism. Our experimental approach re ﬂects the situation in
the plankton with highly complex microbial communities andcomplex exometabolomes ( Barofsky et al., 2010 ). It allows
evaluation of the uptake capacity and incorporation of thetaken-up metabolites under ecologically relevant conditions.
General Patterns in the Uptake of Organic
Metabolites by the Receiving Diatom
C. didymus
Detailed analysis of the mass spectra allows to draw a picture of
osmotrophy in C. didymus (Figure 4 ). More than a quarter of all
detected metabolites in C. didymus were labeled to different
degrees ( Figure 1 ). Nearly 10% showed the identical labeling
pattern as those in the13C-labeled S. costatum metabolome.
These metabolites are not (or only to a minor extent) synthesizedby the receiver but taken up and maintained in the cells or theuptake could down-regulate synthesis in the receiver. The majorpart of taken-up metabolites showed mixed labeling, indicativefor the uptake of a metabolite that is also synthesized by the
receiver. This includes a wide range of natural products from
small charged molecules like choline and carnitine to non-polarlipids and fatty acids. Metabolites acquired from the outsidewater can thus be metabolized in the same way as the de novo
produced compounds, indicating that no compartmentation ofassimilated material occurs. Instead, the osmo(hetero)trophic
and the photo(auto)trophic pool are used for anabolism andcatabolism. For example, the presence of complex labelingpatterns can be explained by the use of intermediate fatty acidsin the anabolism of more complex lipids. The complexisotopologue pattern of oleic acid and 11 Z-eiosenoic acid, for
example, might re ﬂect a dynamic system with rounds of beta
oxidation releasing labeled acetate and subsequent fatty acid re-assembly from this labeled and the own unlabeled acetate pool.Since the isotopologues of these fatty acids are not Bernoulli-distributed the relative amount of labeled acetate in the totalacetate pool used for fatty acid biosynthesis might vary over time.
Utilization of Assimilated Metabolites
The fact that uptake has no apparent preference for nitrogencontaining metabolites contradicts the assumption that diatomsuse speci ﬁc heterotrophic mechan isms to acquire reduced
nitrogen ( Mulholland and Lee, 2009 ). Since we worked in non-
limiting conditions this lack of speci ﬁcity might also re ﬂect that
diatoms do not need additional nitrogen. Flynn and Berry (1999)
suggested that these microbes leak metabolites from internal mMlevels and that they thus must have some recovery (uptake)potential, else they would ‘bleed to death ’.O u r ﬁndings will
likely also hold true for such a recovery of metabolites released
by the cells themselves. Thus, such a recovery mechanism would
b ei np l a c ea n dc o u l db eq u a n t i ﬁed using a modi ﬁed
labeling approach.
Notably, many metabolites with essential physiological
functions are thus not exclusively produced de novo but taken
up in high proportions. Control of physiological concentrations
will thus have to include biosynthesis, catabolism as well as
uptake. A universal uptake could be highly advantageous in theevent of a lysis of a competing algal bloom ( Sohn et al., 2004 ;
Meyer et al., 2017 ). But even under regular conditions in
plankton, algae might encounter metabolites released by othermembers of the phytoplankton that they can take up and bene ﬁt
from ( Sommer et al., 2012 ).
The observation of universal uptake of metabolites requires
re-thinking of the interpretation of incubation studies with singlelabeled substrates. It is well documented that speci ﬁc primary
metabolites can be taken up by the cells under limitingconditions. Thus, under darkness, uptake of organic acids likelactate and malate was observed ( Hellebust and Lewin, 1972 ).
Amino acid usage is prompted by both N and/or C stress ( Flynn
and Wright, 1986 ) and uptake of the essential metabolite
dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) was discussed as a way tocompensate for the lack of own DMSP biosynthetic capabilities(Spielmeyer et al., 2011 ). We now expand this view and
introduce that the diatoms C. didymus and T. weiss ﬂogiican
take up a structural variety of metabolites released from
competitors even under non-limiting growth conditions. Thus,
a universal complementation of the own metabolome occurs andnot a selected uptake of potentially valuable metabolites. Thisunspeci ﬁc uptake of metabolites over a wide range of polarities
and masses newly de ﬁnes the investigated diatoms as a generalMeyer et al. Substrate Uptake by Marine Diatoms
Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 821167 10sink of organic carbon in the sea and might be generalized to the
entire group of these algae.
Physiological Function of
Assimilated Metabolites
Of the multiple labeled metabolites, two groups will be
exemplarily highlighted here, polar nitrogen containing
metabolites and fatty acids. Polar metabolites that are taken up
include glycine betaine, b-alanine betaine, carnitine and choline,
with diverse physiological functions. Glycine betaine is a knownosmolyte and uptake in diatoms has already been describedunder N-limited conditions ( Keller et al., 1999 ;Gebser and
Pohnert, 2013 ). Choline is a biosynthetic precursor of glycine
betaine ( Kageyama et al., 2018 ) and an important building block
of phospholipids ( Borowitzka, 2016 ). In this study, it has been
found as a free form and in lysophosphatidylcholine ( Table 1 ).
However, the labeling patte rn of the choline fragment of
lysophosphatidylcholine differs from the free form(Supplementary Figure 3 ), indicating different origins. b-
alanine betaine is a known osmoprotectant in plants and is
biosynthesized viathe methylation of b-alanine, a building block
of coenzyme A ( Rathinasabapathi et al., 2001 ). It has also been
found in marine algae ( Blunden et al., 1986 ). Carnitine is a
central metabolite in energy metabolism of all eukaryotic cells. Itplays an essential role for the transport of fatty acids across themitochondrial membrane. The utilization of carnitine by
diatoms has been reported previously by measuring oxidation
rates in a bio ﬁlm-forming freshwater diatom ( Tuchman et al.,
2006 ) .T h ep r e s e n c eo fl a b e l e d N-methyl groups
(Supplementary Figure 4 ) excludes lysine degradation ( Paik
et al., 1977 ) as a metabolic origin. The high proportion of
heterotrophically acquired carnitine and the presence of manyfatty acids among the taken-up metabolites is striking. It suggests
a highly active transport mechanism for high-energy fatty acids
and the N-containing carnitine. It would be interesting to
investigate whether an acylcarnitine-type transport systemmight facilitate the uptake of fatty acids across the cellularmembrane. The presence of a protein homologous to a class Icarnitine/acylcarnitine translocase in a diatom cell wall proteome
supports this hypothesis ( Frigeri et al., 2006 ).
Several labeled fatty acids and derivatives have also been
identi ﬁed (Table 1 ). Eicosapentaenoic acid is one of the
dominant fatty acids in diatoms and precursor of manybioactive oxylipins ( Pohnert and Boland, 2002 ;Borowitzka,
2016 ;Rettner et al., 2018 ;Zulu et al., 2018 ). 6Z,9Z,12Z-
hexadecatrienoic acid is the precursor of octadienal, an
allelopathic polyunsaturated aldehyde ( D’ippolito et al., 2003 ).
A l s o ,o l e i ca c i d ,1 1 Z-eicosenoic acid, and 6 Z,9Z,12Z
,15-
hexadecatetraenoic acid are common in diatoms ( Ackman
et al., 1968 ;Dunstan et al., 1994 ;Pohnert et al., 2004 ;Chen,
2012 ;Zulu et al., 2018 ). Two other C18- and C20
polyunsaturated fatty acids were identi ﬁed according to
retention time and mass spectra. Comparison with synthetic
standards showed that these fatty acids were isomers of linoleicand arachidonic acid. Fatty acids and their derivatives have
multiple physiological functions. The fact that they are presentin labeled and unlabeled for ms after the pulse labeling
experiments indicates an unbiased utilization of de novo and
assimilated compounds. This might serve as a mechanism toavoid costly biosynthesis of fatty acids, which is supported by the
observation that the fatty acids are not only internalized or
adsorbed to lipidic structures due to their physicochemicalproperties but rather incorporated into the primarymetabolism of the diatom.
The broad range of polarity and molecular weight of
assimilated compounds raises the question of the uptake
mechanism. Candidate systems for fatty acid shuttling include
speciﬁc transporters and genome data shows homolog candidate
sequences ( Frigeri et al., 2006 ;Indiveri et al., 2011 ). But indeed,
also unspeci ﬁc osmotrophy and incorporation mechanisms that
do not require transporters will most likely be involved.Nevertheless, the question of how diatoms acquire exogenous
metabolites is still open.
Concluding Remarks
The diatom C. didymus takes up and incorporates metabolites
from lysed competitors with surprising little bias. Preliminary
results suggest that the same is true for the diatom T. weiss ﬂogii
(data not shown), which indicates a rather universal mechanism.The multitude of cellular functions in which these metabolitesare involved suggests that uptake complements the internalmetabolic pool from many different biosynthetic pathways.
The universal osmotrophic lifestyle of members of one of the
most abundant algal classes in the oceans substantially changes
our view of the metabolic shuttling in phytoplanktoncommunities. These algae take up more metabolites than just afew highly polar compounds for e.g. nitrogen supply. They rathercomplement their metabolism quite universally with resourcesfrom the surrounding seawater. This process occurs even under
illumination and is not related to the complementation of lacking
photosynthate in the dark. It will have to be veri ﬁed if this is a
universal property of diatoms and if also other members of thephytoplankton utilize similar strategies, as it is already indicatedby work on Emiliania huxleyi (Godrijan et al., 2021 ). In addition
to bacteria, diatoms and other phytoplankton compete for thedissolved organic carbon in the plankton ( Berge et al., 2012 ;
Georges et al., 2014 ). Our study thus has consequences for
element cycling in the oceans and ecosystem dynamics thatwill have to be addressed in the future.
