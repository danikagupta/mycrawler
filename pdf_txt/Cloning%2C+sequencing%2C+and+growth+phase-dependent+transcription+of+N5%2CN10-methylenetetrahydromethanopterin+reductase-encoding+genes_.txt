conducted with Methanothermobacter marburgensis . The fractionation of carbon isotopes between CO2and
CH4was found to range from 22 to 58‰ (1.023 /H11349/H9251/H113491.064). Greater fractionation was associated with low
levels of molecular hydrogen and steady-state metabolism. The fractionation of hydrogen isotopes between
source H2O and CH4was found to range from 127 to 275‰ (1.16 /H11349/H9251/H113491.43). Fractionation was dependent
on growth phase with greater fractionation associated with later growth stages. The maximum observed
fractionation factor was 1.43, independent of the /H9254D-H2supplied to the culture. Fractionation was positively
correlatedwithtemperatureand/ormetabolicrate.Resultsdemonstratesigniﬁcantvariabilityinbothhydrogen

1. INTRODUCTION
Methane, CH4, is an environmentally important greenhouse
gasandisaneconomicallyimportantfuel.Methaneisproduced
in nature by four principle processes, biogenesis (as the endproduct of microbial metabolism; Ferry, 1993 ), thermogenesis
(chemical degradation of organic material at elevated temper-
ature and pressure; Schoell, 1988 ), geogenesis (as the result of
interaction between geologic ﬂuids with chemically reducedrocks;Horita and Berndt, 1999; Lollar et al., 2002 ), and igni-
genesis (as a byproduct of combustion). The rate at which CH
4
is released to the atmosphere is well-constrained and is cur-
rently ca. 5.0 /H110031014g per year (e.g., Cicerone and Oremland,
1988). The overall rate of CH4production in nature is certainly
greater than the release rate to the atmosphere, but is poorly
constrained due to difﬁculties in quantifying the impact ofmicrobially mediated CH
4oxidation (methanotrophy). The
global rate of methanogenesis can be estimated as the sum of
the global oxidation rate (6.9–9.2 /H110031014gy/H110021;Reeburgh,1996; Valentine, 2002 ) and the global atmospheric ﬂux (5.0 /H11003
1014gy/H110021). Of the total 1.2–1.4 /H110031015go fC H4produced
annually, the majority of this CH4is produced biogenically,
likely greater than 85%.
Biogenic CH4production (hereafter referred to as methano-
genesis) occurs at all temperatures between freezing and boil-ing (Valentine and Boone, 2000 ). The majority of CH
4cur-
rently released to the atmosphere is produced near the surface,at temperatures between 0 and 50°C. Abundant CH
4is also
produced in environments with elevated temperatures (moder-ately thermal environments, deﬁned here as having tempera-
tures from /H1101150–110°C), including geothermal springs, hydro-
thermalvents,andwastedigestors.Themostimportantofthesemoderately thermal methanogenic environments are deeplyburied sediments, which are heated from below by the geother-
mal gradient (comprising much of the “deep biosphere”). The
primary energy source for heterotrophic microbes in such en-vironments is the organic carbon initially deposited with thesediment. Little is known about biogenic CH
4production in
moderately thermal subsurface environments, much of our
knowledge comes from hydrocarbon exploration and fromstudies of other moderately thermal environments includingwaste digestors. Biogenic CH
4produced in moderately thermal
settings is generally distinguished from thermogenic CH4by
the carbon and hydrogen isotopic content of the CH4as well as
by comparing the abundance of CH4to ethane and propane
(Schoell, 1980 ).* Author to whom correspondence should be addressed

1571Biogenic CH4is produced by two primary pathways, the
aceticlastic reaction (Eqn. 1), and CO2reduction (Eqn. 2). The
reduction of CO2can be accomplished with either hydrogen
(H2) or formate (HCOO/H11002) acting as reductant.

Several other methanogenic pathways exist, but are thought to
be less important quantitatively ( Cicerone and Oremland,
1988). The relative importance of the two primary methano-
genic pathways varies depending on the environment. In ter-restrial environments with moderate temperatures, the aceti-
clastic reaction accounts for up to 70% of all CH
4produced
with CO2reduction accounting for /H1101130%. In moderately ther -
mal environments this ratio changes, and CO2reduction is
often quantitatively more important than the aceticlastic reac-
tion (Fey et al., 2003 ). In permanently cold marine sediments,
CH4is thought to be derived primarily from CO2reduction
(Whiticar et al., 1986 ). The relative importance of the aceti-
clastic reaction versus CO2reduction is not known for deep,
moderately thermal environments. Interestingly, many thermo-
philic methanogens have been isolated capable of CO2reduc-
tion,whileonlyahandfulofsuchorganismsareknowntocarry
out the aceticlastic reaction. Furthermore, no extreme thermo-
philescapableofperformingtheaceticlasticreactionhavebeenisolated.
Methane produced in deep subsurface environments gener-
allymigratesalongtheconcentrationgradienttowardtheocean
and atmosphere, often being physically or chemically trapped
in the subsurface. Trapping of CH
4, such as in the case of CH4
hydrates, allows for the buildup of a large subsurface reservoirwhich may act as a capacitor ( Dickens, 2003 ). Massive CH
4
releases from the subsurface reservoir may have impacted
Earth’s climate at several times in the past, including the
Proterozoic ( Kennedy et al., 2001 ), the early Cretaceous
(Jahren et al., 2001 ), the terminal Paleocene thermal maximum
(Dickens et al., 1997 ), the Permian/Triassic boundary ( Krull
and Retallack, 2000 ), the late Jurrasic ( Padden et al., 2001 )a s
well as during the Quaternary ( Kennett et al., 2002 ). Deep
subsurface CH4is likely a major source of such CH4.
Given the importance of methanogenesis in moderately ther-
mal environments, the importance of isotopic distributions in
characterizing CH4sources, uncertainties regarding carbon and
hydrogen isotopic fractionation in thermophilic methanogens,
uncertainties regarding the role of acetate in moderately ther-mal environments, and the importance of CH
4in rapid climate
change, we performed a series of laboratory studies to increaseunderstanding of the physical, chemical and biologic factors
controlling stable isotope fractionation in moderately thermo-philic methanogens. A series of four studies were performed toquantify carbon isotope fractionation during methanogenesis
from acetate (Experiment A), hydrogen isotope fractionation
during methanogenesis from acetate (Experiment B), carbonisotope fractionation during CO
2/H2methanogenesis (Experi -
ment C), and hydrogen isotope fraction during CO2/H2metha-
nogenesis (Experiment D). Table 1provides a general guide to
these experiments.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Organisms and Culture Conditions
Pure cultures of Methanosaeta thermophila strain CALS-1 (DSMZ
3870;Zinder et al., 1987 ) and strain PT(OCM 778; Kamagata and
Mikami, 1991 ) were used for experiments to study carbon and hydro-
genisotopefractionationduringmethanogenesisfromacetate.Cultureswere grown at 61°C in crimp-top bottles using a modiﬁed Hungatetechnique ( Hungate, 1969 ) in a deﬁned mineral salts medium initially
containing 30 mM acetate as the sole energy source. The mediumcontained (per liter): 0.4 g KH
2PO4,0 . 5gN H4Cl, 0.1 g MgCl2·6 H2O,
0.05 g CaCl2·2 H2O, 1 mg resazurin, 1.0 g NaHCO3,0 . 3 6gN a2S·
9H2O, 0.15 g CoM, 0.04 mg biotin, 5.0 mg sodium EDTA dihydrate,
1.5mgCoCl·6H2O,1.0mgMnCl2·4H2O,1.0mgFeSO2·7H2O,1.0
mg ZnCl2, 0.4 mg AlCl3·6 H2O, 0.3 mg Na2WO4·2 H2O, 0.2 mg
CuCl2·2 H2O, 0.2 mg NiSO4·6 H2O, 0.1 mg H2SeO3, 0.1 mg H3BO3,
and 0.1 mg Na2MoO4·2 H2O.
Methanothermobacter marburgensis (formerly Methanobacterium
thermautotrophicum strain Marburg-OCM 82; Wasserfallen et al.,
2000) was used in studies of CO2/H2methanogenesis. The organism
was originally isolated from a thermophilic waste digestor in Marburg,
Germany ( Fuchs et al., 1978 ); closely related species have been ob-
served in a variety of moderately thermal environments includingpetroleum reservoirs ( Orphan et al., 2000 ) and thermal springs. M.
marburgensis is chemoautotrophic and is capable of reducing CO
2as
its sole carbon and energy source. The organism was grown in MS
medium ( Boone et al., 1989 ), or with modiﬁed MS mineral medium as
noted. MS medium (complex) contains exogenous organic materialwhile the only organic component in modiﬁed MS mineral medium(deﬁned) was mercaptoethane sulfonate (100 mg per liter).
2.2. Carbon Isotope Fractionation Studies
2.2.1. Carbon isotope fractionation from acetate
Fourexperiments(A-1throughA-4)wereperformedinsealedserum
bottles to quantify the isotopic fractionation factors associated withaceticlastic methanogenesis by M. thermophila; experiments were de-
signed to assess the discrimination against both the methyl position ofacetate (which gives rise to CH
4) and the whole acetate molecule.
Inoculum for experiments with strain CALS-1 was obtained from late
stationary phase cultures that had been thoroughly purged of CH4(so
as not to interfere with the isotopic measurements). Three crimp-top
serum bottles designated experiments A-1, A-2, and A-3 (1.05 L, 1.05L, and 1.2 L, respectively), each containing basal medium (382 mL,Table 1. Experiments presented in this study.

Direct).1572 D. L. Valentine et al.387 mL, and 447 mL-respectively), were inoculated with 20 mL of a
stationary phase culture of M. thermophila strain CALS-1. Cultures
were sampled immediately after inoculation for CH4concentration,
acetate concentration, /H925413C-CH4,/H925413C-Acbulk, and/H925413C-Acmethyl. Ini-
tial experimental conditions are given in Table 2.
After the initial liquid and gas samples had been removed, all three
bottles were transferred to an incubator and maintained at 61 °C.Periodic sampling for CH
4concentration, acetate concentration, /H925413C-
CH4,/H925413C-Acbulk, and/H925413C-Acmethylwas performed daily, or every
other day, from each of the three bottles for a period of 2 weeks. The
temperature during sampling was maintained between 51 and 61 °C soas to not interrupt growth. The sampling procedure involved ﬁrstremoving a small (0.2–5 mL) sample of headspace gas, and measuringthe CH
4mixing ratio. Then, a known overpressure of N2was added (to
avoid drawing a vacuum) and a large volume gas sample (20–240 mL)
was removed for analysis of /H925413C-CH4. After gas samples were re -
moved, liquid samples were taken for analysis of acetate concentrationand isotopic composition.
To analyze possible changes in fractionation during different growth
phases, the bottle representing experiment A-1 was completely purgedof CH
4after each sampling. The bottle was purged for 4 min at a
temperature of 51–61°C (5–10 L-min/H110021), then incubated for 15 min
(61°C)withoccasionalvigorousshaking.Finally,thebottlewaspurged
for an additional 4 min (at 51–55°C), vented to atmospheric pressure,and then a known volume of CO
2was added as an overpressure. The
partial pressure of residual CH4was generally near 2 Pa. Samples for
lipid isotope analysis were taken from bottle A-1 after the substrate
concentration fell below 10 mM, so as to ensure sufﬁcient biomass forisotope analysis. Growth phase was inferred from the rate of acetatedepletion and CH
4production.
A second strain of M. thermophila, strain PT, was also used to study
isotopic fractionation from the aceticlastic reaction (Experiment A-4)
to determine if fractionation differs between two strains of the samespecies. Culture conditions were identical to those described for strainCALS-1exceptreplicateculturesweregrownin125mLserumbottles.Methane samples were collected after the CH
4reached 6% so as to
avoid signiﬁcant isotopic enrichment of the residual acetate.
2.2.2. Carbon isotope fractionation from H2/CO2
Four experiments (C-1 through C-4) were performed using an H2-
controlling bioreactor ( Valentine et al., 2000a ) to assess the impact of
H2partial pressure, temperature, media organic content, and light level
on carbon isotope fractionation. Studies were designed to test the
hypothesis that H2partial pressure impacts carbon isotope fraction -ation, while controlling for variability in temperature and media or-
ganic content. Experiments were further designed to explore observa-tionspresentedby Botzetal.(1996) ofgreaterfractionationintitanium
(dark) versus glass (illuminated) bioreactors. Inoculum for each exper-iment was obtained from 300 mL cultures grown to completion (sub-strate depletion, OD
598/H110610.3) in seale d 1 L bottles under a mixture of
105Pa H2,3/H11003104Pa CO2,and 7 /H11003104Pa N2. After inoculation into
the bioreactor, the total gas ﬂow rate, the partial pressure of CO2and
/H925413C-CO2were held constant for the duration of each experiment. The
mixing ratio of H2was set by mass ﬂow controllers and conﬁrmed by
both upstream and downstream measurements (before entering the
reactorvesselandintheexhauststream).Methaneconcentrationsintheexhaust gas were measured before each experiment; background CH
4
was always found to be below 0.03 Pa. The downstream CH4concen-
tration was also below 0.03 Pa during an uninoculated control exper-iment. Experimental conditions are shown in Table 3.
A sterilized glass reactor vessel with a total working volume of 230
mL was ﬁlled to a ﬁnal volume of 200 mL for each experiment. Theapparatus is similar to that described by Valentine et al. (2000a ,b)
though alterations were necessary because H
2was being fed into the
vessel, not sparged from the vessel. Gases were fed to the culture using
mass ﬂow controllers. Flow rate calibrations were conﬁrmed using aprimary standard airﬂow calibrator (The Gilibrator, Gilian InstrumentsCorp., W. Caldwell, NJ). Gas ﬂowed through a copper column main-tained at 200°C to remove residual oxygen before entering the reactorvessel.
2.3. Hydrogen Isotope Fractionation Studies
2.3.1. Hydrogen isotope fractionation from acetate
Fourexperiments(B-1throughB-4)wereperformedinsealedserum
bottlestoquantifythehydrogenisotopefractionationfactorsassociatedwith aceticlastic methanogenesis by M. thermophila; experiments were
designed to assess the fractionation between both the methyl-boundhydrogens of acetate and the hydrogen in ambient water with theresulting CH
4. Inoculum for experiments with M. thermophila was
obtained from late stationary phase cultures that had been thoroughly
purged of CH4(so as not to interfere with the isotopic measurements).
Three 250-mL crimp-top serum bottles designated Experiments B-1,
B-2, and B-3, each containing 125 mL basal medium, were inoculatedwith 5 mL of a stationary phase culture of M. thermophila strain
CALS-1.Culturesweregrownat61°C.The

inExperimentsB-1,B-2andB-3was /H1100292.1,/H110011227.2and /H11001239.7‰,
respectively. Liquid and gas samples were taken immediately afterinoculation for analysis of CH

/H9254D-Ac.Liquidandgassampleswerethentakeneveryotherdayfor4d

experiments with strain CALS-1 were stopped after 4 d, while still at
an early stage of growth, due to poor culture growth.
A second strain of M. thermophila, strain PT, was also used to study
hydrogen isotopic fractionation from H2O/acetate (Experiment B-4,
same culture as Experiment A-4). Culture conditions were identical to
those described for strain CALS-1 except that replicate cultures weregrown in 125 mL serum bottles. Methane samples were removed afterthe CH
4reached 6% so as to avoid signiﬁcant isotopic enrichment of
the residual acetate. The initial /H9254D-H2O of the culture media was /H1100271

Three experiments (D-1 through D-3) were performed using an
H2-controllingbioreactortodeterminetheinﬂuenceofgrowthphaseon
D/H fractionation in H2and CH4, the impact of varying /H9254D-H2on
/H9254D-CH4, and the impact of temperature and catabolic rate on D/H
fractionation in H2and CH4. A sterilized glass reactor vessel with a
total working volume of 300 mL was ﬁlled to a ﬁnal volume of
250–260 mL for each experiment. The apparatus is similar to that
described previously ( Valentine et al., 2000a ).
Inoculum for each experiment was obtained from 10 mL cultures
grown to completion in sealed 20 mL tubes under a mixture of 105Pa
H2,3/H11003104Pa CO2,and 7 /H11003104Pa N2. The total gas ﬂow rate was
set to 55 mL min/H110021(normalized to STP) at the beginning of Experi -
ment D-1, and was changed to 15 mL min/H110021after the 31st hour of
experimentation due to analytical difﬁculties in quantifying /H9254D-CH4at
relativelylowmixingratios.ExperimentsD-2andD-3wereperformed
with a ﬂow rate of 15 mL min/H110021. The mixing ratio of H2was set by
massﬂowcontrollersandconﬁrmedbybothupstreamanddownstream
measurements (before entering the reactor vessel and in the exhauststream). Methane concentrations in the exhaust gas were measuredbefore each experiment; background CH
4was always found to be
below 0.03 Pa. Experimental conditions are given in Table 3. Experi-
ment D-3 was a continuation of Experiment D-2, performed with thesame culture immediately after Experiment D-2 had ended.
2.4. Isotope Systematics and Calculation of Fractionation
Factors
All carbon isotope values are given in the per mil notation (‰)
relative to the V-PDB standard (Pee Dee belemnite carbonate, asestablished by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inVienna, Austria; Coplen, 1995; Gonﬁantini et al., 1995 ). All hydrogen
isotope values are given in the per mil notation (‰) relative to theV-SMOW standard (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water as estab-lished by the IAEA).
Fractionationfactorsreportedinthisstudyareexpressedusingeither
the
/H9251or/H9255notation. In the case where isotopic equilibrium is achieved,
/H9251is deﬁned as:
/H9251/H11005Ra/Rb (3)
where Raand Rbare the isotope ratios of reactants and products,
respectively. In the case where isotope fractionation arises from kinetic
processes, /H9251is deﬁned as:
/H9251/H11005rl/rh (4)
where rland rhare the reaction rates for the species containing the light
andheavyisotope,respectively.Incaseswherefractionationsaresmall
(less than 10‰; O’Neill, 1986 ) the fractionation factor, /H9255, can be used:
/H9255/H11005/H20849/H9251/H110021/H20850/H110031000 (5)
In all cases here, fractionation factors represent net fractionation asso-
ciated with a series of physical and chemical steps; however, fraction-ation factors are presented as if they were associated with a single step.Fractionation factors associated with speciﬁc and individual reactionsremain constant; such fractionation factors reﬂect isotope discrimina-tion due to kinetic and/or thermodynamic isotope effects. Fractionationfactors associated with multistep reactions are variable and may beexpressed at different levels. See Hayes (1983, 2001 ) for a detailed
consideration of these issues.
2.4.1. Carbon isotope fractionation in M. thermophila
To calculate the carbon isotope fractionation factors associated with
aceticlastic methanogenesis by M. thermophila, we apply both closed-
and open-system models. Models of closed-system behavior are con-sidered ﬁrst, open-system behavior is considered later. For furtherdetails on open and closed isotopic systems see Hayes (1983, 2001 ).
An isotopic system is considered to be closed if no material crosses
its boundaries. As a reaction proceeds, the fractional yield of theproduct increases and the isotopic composition of the products andreactants vary in a systematic fashion, controlled by the fractionationfactor,
/H9251. Because of mass balance constraints reactants become iso-
topically enriched as the reaction proceeds, and the isotopic composi-tion of the pooled product tends toward the initial isotopic compositionofthereactant.Fractionationfactorsassociatedwithaceticlasticmetha-nogenesis (Experiment A) can be determined as a closed system usingthe approach of Gelwicks et al. (1989, 1994 ):
/H9254af/H11005/H9254ai/H11002/H9255m[ln(1/H11002f)] (6)
where f is the fractional yield based on the consumption of acetate, /H9254af
is the/H925413C of the methyl position of acetate at any f, /H9254aiis the initial
/H925413Cofthemethylpositionofacetate,and /H9255misthefractionationfactor
between the methyl position of acetate and CH4. An equation of
identical form can be constructed for the conversion of the whole
acetate molecule:
/H9254wf/H11005/H9254wi/H11002/H9255w[ln(1/H11002f)] (7)
where /H9254wfis the/H925413C of the whole acetate molecule at any f, /H9254wiis the
initial/H925413C of the whole acetate molecule, and /H9255wis the fractionation
factor between the whole acetate molecule and product. This equation
assumes no isotope exchange between the carboxyl position of acetateand CO
2. An independent equation can be constructed based on the
isotopic composition of the pooled product, CH4:
/H9254mf/H11005/H9254ai/H11001/H9255m(1/H11002f) [ln(1 /H11002f)]/f (8)
where/H9254mfisthe/H925413CofpooledCH4atanyf.Theisotopicfractionation
factor, /H9255m,canbedeterminedbyregressing /H9254afagainstln(1 /H11002f),or/H9254mf
against (1 /H11002f) [ln(1 /H11002f)]/f. Similarly, /H9255wcan be determined by
regressing /H9254wfagainst ln(1 /H11002f). In each case /H9255is determined by the
slope of the linear regression.
For Experiment A the fractional yield, f, is determined by following
changes in acetate concentration. In the case of Eqn. 6 and 7, f at anygiven time is determined from the ratio of the acetate concentration atthat time to initial acetate concentration and is independent of thequantity of liquid or gas removed during sampling. In the case of Eqn.8, determination of f requires that all acetate removed during samplingbe accounted for. Similarly, in the case of Eqn. 6 and 7,
/H9254afand/H9254wfat
anygiventimeareequaltothe /H9254afand/H9254wfvaluesmeasuredatthattime.
However, in the case of Eqn. 8, /H9254mfrepresents the /H925413C of all CH4
produced, and is thus dependent on gas removed from the system. The
value of /H9254mfis determined using an isotopic mass balance accounting
for all CH4removed from the system.
An isotopically open system is one which reactants are constantly
added and products constantly withdrawn. Stated another way, thesupplyofsubstrateforareactionisunlimitedrelativetotheappearanceof product. During the early stages of growth Experiments A-1, A-2,A-3, and A-4 can be treated as open systems. Because CH
4produced
by the aceticlastic reaction is generated exclusively from the methyl
position of acetate ( Pine and Barker, 1956 ), and because the fraction-
ations involved are relatively small, the isotopic enrichment factor, /H9255m,
isusedhereforaceticlasticmethanogenesis.Methaneproductionby M.
thermophila duringtheearlystagesofgrowthreasonablyapproximates
conditions of unlimited acetate, as does the regular purging of head-space CH
4, as in Experiment A-1.
2.4.2. Carbon isotope fractionation in M. marburgensis
Carbonisotopicfractionationfactorsfor M.marburgensis, measured
in Experiment C, were calculated using an open-system approach,assumingCO
2asaninﬁnitereservoirandtheconstantremovalofCH4.
ThisassumptionisvalidbaseduponthelowconversionofCO2toCH4
(/H113493%) and the rapid gas ﬂow through the culture system. In addition,
the upstream /H925413C-CO2was assumed to be equal to the downstream
/H925413C-CO2, an assumption supported by the distribution of /H925413C-CO2in
the various experiments, and by the results of Chidthaisong et al.
(2002). The measured /H925413C-CO2was assumed to be the same as that
available for methanogenesis. Although fractionation occurs during
CO2dissolution (thermodynamic) and during gas transfer (kinetic), the
fractionations are small ( /H110611–2‰;Zhang et al., 1995 ) and were not
quantiﬁed for the experimental conditions employed. Stable isotopefractionation factors (
/H9251-factors) for coexisting CO2-CH4pairs were1574 D. L. Valentine et al.then calculated directly according to Eqn. 3, where /H9251is a numerical
representation of fractionation for the entire methanogenic pathway.
2.4.3. Hydrogen isotope fractionation in M. marburgensis
DuringH2/CO2methanogenesistheultimatesourceofcarbon-bound
hydrogen in CH4(e.g., CH4-bound hydrogen) is thought to be H2O
(Daniels et al., 1980; Spencer et al., 1980 ), though the immediate
precursors are not completely understood. There are several potentialsources of CH
4hydrogen, including H2O, H2, and methyl-bound hy -
drogen (e.g., from acetate, methyl amines, methyl thiols, and metha-nol). Furthermore, CH
4hydrogen may cycle through the proton pool,
through biologic reductants such as coenzyme F420and coenzyme M,
and through amino acid residues. A combination of kinetic and equi-
librium isotope effects give rise to the ultimate hydrogen isotopedistributions in CH
4. Because /H9254D varies by several hundred per mil in
these studies, and because the /H9254notation is nonlinear in this range
(O’Neil, 1986 ), D/H ratios ( r/H11005D/H) are needed to calculate fraction-
ation factors between H2O and CH4:
/H9251(H2O™CH4)/H11005RH2O/RCH4 (9)
and between H2O and H2:
/H9251(H2O™H2)/H11005RH2O/RH2 (10)
The/H9251notation, as applied here, quantiﬁes the difference in isotopic
composition between two hydrogen-containing molecules linked bio-chemically.Forexample,inEqn.10,
/H9251onlyappliestotheH2produced
by the hydrogenase system (see section 2.4.4), not to the H2entering
the system. The use of this notation does not presume a predominance
of kinetic or equilibrium isotope effects, it is intended only to quantifyempirical observations of net isotopic fractionation resulting frommethanogenesis.
2.4.4. Determination of hydrogenase efﬁciency in M. marburgensis
To determine the efﬁciency of the hydrogenase system in M. mar-
burgensis, a mass balance was constructed based on the experimental
design(Eqn.11).Aschematicofthesystemaswellasdeﬁnitionsofthesystem variables are given in Figure 1.
f
outRout/H11005finRin/H11001fhRh/H11002fcRc (11)
Eqn. 11 assumes there are no other signiﬁcant sources or sinks of H2
besides hydrogenase in the system. The gross H2consumption term in
Eqn. 11 (fc/H11003Rc) can be expressed as the sum of individual production
and consumption terms, yielding Eqn. 12:
foutRout/H11005finRin/H11001fhRh/H11002(fh/H11001fm/H11001fb)Rc (12)
The D/H ratio of H2consumed (activated) by hydrogenase (Rc) can be
expressed in terms of the D/H ratio of dissolved H2(Rdis), given the
fractionation factor ( /H9251c) associated with H2uptake by hydrogenase
(e.g., Rdis/H11005/H9251c/H11003Rc).foutRout/H11005finRin/H11001fhRh/H11002(fh/H11001fm/H11001fb)(Rdis//H9251c) (13)
Because of the low energy yields associated with methanogenesis,
biomass yields tend to be low ( Schonheit et al., 1980 ). Therefore we
assume fbis negligible. Eqn. 13 can then be rearranged to solve for fh
(Eqn. 14):
fh/H11005(foutRdis/H11002finRin/H11001fmRdis//H9251c)/(Rh/H11002(Rdis//H9251c)) (14)
Theefﬁciencyofthehydrogenasesystemcanbedeﬁnedintermsofthe
ﬂuxes (Eqn. 15), where E approaches one at high efﬁciency, and E
approaches zero at low efﬁciencies:
E/H110051/H11002fh/(fh/H11001fm) (15)
To calculate E (as a function of Rhand/H9251c), the ﬂux of reducing
equivalents diverted to CH4is assumed to be equal to four times the
rateofCH4production(seeEqn.1).WefurtherassumeRdis/H11005Rout,Rw

2.5. Analytical Methods
Methane concentration analyses were performed using a gas chro-
matograph equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector (Mini-2, Shi-madzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). For Experiments A and B, discrete gassamples were removed by syringe from experimental bottles, andmeasured immediately. For Experiments C and D, the gas chromato-graph was integrated into the gas exhaust line. Acetate was quantiﬁedin Experiments A and B by HPLC as previously described ( Valentine
etal.,2000b ).HydrogenwasquantiﬁedinExperimentCbyperforming
known volume dilutions of the exhaust gas and quantifying using areducing gas analyzer, as previously described ( Valentine et al.,
2000b).
For Experiments A and B, discrete samples for quantiﬁcation of
/H925413C-CH4and/H9254D-CH4were collected by syringe, transferred into
evacuated serum bottles, and stored for later isotopic analyses. Sample
bulbs (Experiment C) or stoppered-serum bottles (Experiment D) wereincorporated into the exhaust line in the case of the bioreactor studies.Bulbs and serum bottles were ﬂushed for at least 40 min with theexhaust gas before removal for isotopic analysis.
Analyses for
/H925413C-CH4and/H925413C-CO2for Experiment C were per -
formed in the Isotope Biogeochemistry Laboratory at the University ofHawaii using the technique of Sansone et al. (1997) . For all other
experiments, isotopic analyses of CH
4(/H925413C,/H9254D), CO2(/H925413C), H2
(/H9254D), and H2O(/H9254D) were performed at the University of California
Irvineusingtechniquesdescribedpreviously( Tyleretal.,1997;Riceet
al., 2001; Chidthaisong et al., 2002 ). Typical uncertainties, quantiﬁed
by replicate measurements of standards, for quantiﬁcation with thesetechniques are:
/H925413C-CO2(/H110060.4‰), /H925413C-CH4(/H110060.3‰), /H9254D-H2(/H11006
7.3‰), /H9254D-CH4(/H110064.6‰), and /H9254D-H2O(/H110061‰).
Acetate samples were puriﬁed using HPLC by collecting the acetate
fraction from each run. After puriﬁcation the samples were split intotwoaliquots.TheﬁrstaliquotwasaddedtoastrongNaOHsolutionanddriedinaquartztubeundervacuum.Thetubeswereﬂamesealedundervacuum and the acetate was pyrolyzed at 400 °C, converting thecarboxyl carbon to CO
2and the methyl carbon to CH4(Blair et al.,
1985). The CH4was separated from the CO2in a vacuum line,
combusted to CO2, and analyzed by IRMS as above. The second
aliquot was used to measure total acetate (methyl plus carboxyl car-
bons).Afterbeingdriedthesamplewascombustedat900°Cinasealedquartz tube ﬁlled with 0.2 g CuO wire and silver foil. Tubes were
cleaned of organic residue by heating at 900°C fo r 2 h before sample
addition. The isotopic composition of the resulting CO
2was deter -
mined in the same manner as described above. The isotopic composi-tion of the carbon in the carboxyl position was calculated from theisotopic mass balance of the methyl carbon and total carbon. Typicaluncertainty for quantiﬁcation of acetate
/H925413C, quantiﬁed by replicate
measurements of standards, was /H110062‰.
Samples for lipid analysis were collected from Experiment A-1, and
centrifuged aerobically at 6500 /H11003gf o r1ht o form cell pellets. The
supernatant was decanted and the pellets transferred to small glassvials. The vials were warmed under a slow stream of N
2until dry, and
were then stored in an airtight jar containing anhydrous CaSO4. Isoto-

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Carbon Isotope Fractionation
3.1.1. Methanogenesis from acetate
Results from Experiments A-1, A-2 and A-3 are given in
Figure 2. For Experiments A-2 and A-3, CH4concentrations
built up in the headspace of the experimental vessel over the
course of the experiment ( Figs. 2c,e ), though samples were
removed frequently for the various analyses. The headspaceCH
4in Experiment A-1 ( Fig. 2a) displays an unusual sawtooth
pattern due to frequent purging. A simple mass balance as-
sumes the sum of CH4quantiﬁed in these bottles and the CH4
removed from these bottles is equal to the acetate consumed.Calculations for Experiments A-2 and A-3 are within 10%, and
are consistent with the expected result. Results of a massbalance for Experiment A-1 do not fall within experimentalerror (CH
4is underestimated by 30–40% relative to acetate
consumption), presumably because of calculation errors asso-
ciated with frequent purging of CH4from the headspace.
Ineachexperimenttheculturesgrewatdifferentrates.Based
on the rate of CH4production and acetate consumption, all
cultures appear to have gone through the typical stages of
microbial growth. These stages include a lag phase beforegrowth occurs, an exponential phase in which cell growth isunhindered and metabolic products appear in an exponentialfashion, a stationary phase when cell metabolism continues but
thepopulationcomestosteadystate(growthrate /H11005deathrate),
and a death phase when cells die and metabolism ceases. The
culture in Experiment A-3 utilized almost all of the acetate
supplied, while the cultures in Experiments A-1 and A-2 only
consumed acetate to /H1101110 mM. M. thermophila consumes
acetate to a threshold value near 20
/H9262M(Min and Zinder,
1989), therefore another factor must have inhibited growth at
the end of the experiment.
The/H925413C of the ether lipid archaeol, which constituted
/H1101180% of the total extractable lipids, was found to be /H1100230‰ in
a sample from Experiment A-1 taken on day 13 (K. Hinrichs,
personal communication).
3.1.1.1. Determination of /H9255m.Isotopic fractionation factors
(/H9255m) for the conversion of the acetate methyl to CH4were
determined using a closed-system approach (Eqn. 6) by com-
paring the /H925413C of the residual acetate to the fractional yield
(Fig. 3). The fractionation factors calculated for conversion of
methyl acetate to CH4range from 6.1 to 10‰ (CH4depleted
relative to acetate).
Isotopic fractionation factors ( /H9255m) for the conversion of the
acetate methyl to CH4were determined independently using a
closed-system approach by comparing the /H925413C of the pooled
CH4(calculatedbymassbalance)tothefractionalyieldofCH4
(also determined by mass balance). As given in Eqn. 8 and
shown in Figure 4, the linear regression of (1 /H11002f)ln(1 /H11002f)/f
versus /H925413C of pooled acetate yields a slope of /H9255m. Results
indicate two distinctive trends, one corresponding to the early
Fig. 2. Variations in the partial pressure (Pa) and /H925413C of headspace methane ( /H18540) as well as the concentration (mM) and

sealed-bottle Experiments. (a, b) Experiment A-1; (c, d) Experiment A-2; (e, f) Experiment A-3. For Experiment A-1, the
headspace was purged after each sampling, giving rise to the sawtooth pattern in (a). For Experiments A-2 and A-3 CH4
was allowed to build up over the course of the experiment, except that some samples were removed for concentration andisotope analysis, and inert gas was added to maintain a positive headspace pressure.1576 D. L. Valentine et al.Fig. 3. Determination of /H9255mfor Experiments A-1 (a), A-2 (b) and

13C/12C and D/H fractionation in methanogensstages of growth, and one corresponding to the later stages of
growth. The breakpoint between the trends occurs midwaythroughtheexperiments,andfurtherseemstocorrespondtothe
transition from exponential product accumulation to linear ac-cumulation. Results indicate that expressed fractionation in-
creases from early growth phases to later growth phases. The
negative slope observed during early growth results from thegradually increasing /H9255
m. Fractionation factors calculated for
only the latter stages of growth from Experiments A-1 and A-3
yield/H9255mvalues of 12.4 and 4.7‰, respectively.
In addition to a closed-system approach, /H9255mwas also calcu -
lated by approximating an open system (Eqn. 5). For Experi-
ment A-1 this is a reasonable approach because the headspacewas purged regularly. The difference between
/H925413C-CH4and
/H925413C-Acmethylis indicative of the instantaneous isotopic frac -
tionation. The average /H9255m, calculated from Experiment A-1
(Fig. 2b), is 5.8‰. Unlike Experiment A-1, Experiments A-2
and A-3 cannot be treated as open systems for the entire courseof the experiment; each experiment shows signiﬁcant
13Ce n-
richment of the residual acetate toward the end of the experi-
ment. Excluding the latter time points, analysis of ExperimentsA-2 and A-3 ( Figs. 2d,f ) are in agreement with Experiment
A-1, with /H9255
mof 6.5 and 5.9‰ respectively. The average /H9255m
from these experiments is 6.1‰, and compares well with the
average /H9255mof 7.7‰ calculated using a closed-system approx -
imation (from Fig. 3).
Carbon isotope fractionation was also measured during the
early growth stages in two replicate experiments with M. ther-
mophila, strain PT. Results from this experiment are summa -
rized in Table 4. Samples taken during the early phase of
growth approximate an open system, as only 12% of the initialacetate had been consumed at the time of sampling. Assuminganopensystem, /H9255

By equally considering each approach and each experiment,
anaverage /H9255mof7.0 /H110062.6‰iscalculated,correspondingtoan
/H9251of 1.007.
3.1.1.2. Determination of /H9255w.Isotopic fractionation factors
(/H9255w) for the conversion of the whole acetate molecule to CH4
and CO2were determined using a closed-system approach
(Eqn. 7) by comparing the /H925413C of the residual acetate to the
fractionalyield( Fig.5).Thefractionationfactorscalculatedfor
conversion of acetate to products are 8.9 to 9.5‰ (CH4and
CO2depleted relative to acetate). /H9255wrepresents the average
fractionation against the methyl and carboxyl positions of ac-
etate. The similar values determined for /H9255wand/H9255mseemingly
indicate there is no intramolecular ordering of acetate during
aceticlastic methanogenesis by M. thermophila . Similarities in
the isotope enrichment patterns of acetate and methyl acetate(Figs. 2b,d ) provide a visual indication that fractionation maybe similar in magnitude at both the methyl and carboxyl posi-
tions. This observation is consistent with the closed-system
approachabove( Fig.5).However,thereisalsoanindicationof
isotopic depletion in total acetate during the early stages ofgrowth (Figs. 2b,d ), possibly due to enzymatically mediated
isotope exchange of the carboxyl position with CO
2(O’Leary
and Yapp, 1978 ). Results here are not sufﬁcient to deﬁnitively
determine the importance of isotopic exchange at the carboxylposition of acetate. In fact, it is possible that acetate experi-ences intramolecular fractionation during consumption, and
that isotopic equilibration between CO
2and the carboxyl po -Table 4. Results of isotope fractionation experiments with M. thermophila strain PT(Experiments A-4 and B-2).

3.1.1.3. Potential mechanisms of fractionation. Several previ-
ous studies have considered fractionation during aceticlastic
methanogenesis at moderate temperatures, both in pure cultureand in environmental samples ( Table 5and references therein).
This work represents the ﬁrst analysis of carbon isotope frac-
tionation associated with the aceticlastic reaction at elevated
temperature. The /H9255
mof 7‰ associated with aceticlastic metha -
nogenesis in M. thermophila is much lower than has been
previously observed for methanogenesis from any substrate,and is not an artifact of the culturing system, as both open- andclosed-system approaches yield similar fractionation factors.
Only two genera of methanogens, Mathanosarcina and
Methanosaeta (sometimes referred to as Methanothrix ), are
known to perform the aceticlastic reaction (Eqn. 1; Fig. 6).Both genera contain mesophilic as well as moderately thermo-
philic species. Previous experiments considering carbon isoto-pic fractionation associated with the aceticlastic reaction havefocused on the genus Methanosarcina, and have been per-
formed at moderate temperatures. Results from such experi-
ments indicate an /H9255
mof/H1101122‰ (Table 5).
The primary ecological difference between the Methanosar-
cinaand theMethanosaeta seems to be that Methanosaeta
specialize in the aceticlastic reaction, to the extent they are
unable to use any other substrates for catabolism. The Meth-
anosarcina are capable of using a variety of other substrates,
and are considered to be metabolic generalists among the
methanogens ( Galagan et al., 2002 ). These two genera employ
different catabolic pathways for the aceticlastic reaction ( Fig.
6); as a result the Methanosaeta are capable of utilizing acetate
to a threshold value near 20 /H9262M, whereas the acetate threshold
for theMethanosarcina is near 500 /H9262M(Min and Zinder,
1989). The difference in catabolic pathways is consistent withTable 5. Compilation of carbon isotope fractionation ( /H9251) factors for methanogenesis by pure cultures.

iBoth open- and closed-system approaches used to calculate an average value for /H9251.157913C/12C and D/H fractionation in methanogensthe smaller expressed fractionation in thermophilic Methano-
saetathan in mesophilic Methanosarcina . However, experi-
ments with mesophilic Methanosaeta indicate an /H9255mof/H1101117‰
(Chidthaisong et al., unpublished results), thus differences in
the enzymatic pathway are unable to completely account for
these observations. A comparison to thermophilic Methanosar-
cinawould be useful in determining the impact of temperature
on fractionation associated with the aceticlastic reaction.
Onepossibleexplanationforthelow /H9255mvaluesexpressedby
M. thermophila is that the uptake or ﬁxation of acetate is an
irreversible process. Assuming reaction by Eqn. 1 is the only
fate for intracellular acetate, no fractionation is possible arisingfrom the catabolic pathway once a biochemical steady-state isachieved. It is also possible that these initial steps of acetatetransport and ﬁxation are somewhat reversible, a situationquantiﬁed by Rees (1973) for sulfate reduction, and discussed
in greater detail in section 3.1.2. This idea is further consistentwith the growth-phase effect apparent in Figures 2 and4. For
example, it is possible the extent of metabolic reversibility is
lower during exponential growth due to elevated rates of me-
tabolism causing a limitation on intracellular acetate delivery.These sorts of rate effects have been considered for phyto-plankton ( Bidigare et al., 1997 ), sulfate reducing bacteria
(Rees, 1973 ), and CO
2-utilizing methanogens ( Valentine,
2000).
3.1.1.4. Environmental implications. Geologic CH4is typi-
cally categorized as thermogenic if /H925413C-CH4is heavier than
/H1100250‰ or biogenic if /H925413C-CH4is lighter than /H1100260‰ (Cice-
rone and Oremland, 1988 ). The environmental implication of
the minimal carbon isotope fractionation associated with ace-ticlastic methanogenesis by M. thermophila is that CH
4pro-
duced by Methanosaeta at elevated temperature is likely to
appear isotopically enriched relative to other sources of CH4.
The actual isotopic content will depend on the isotopic content
at the methyl position of acetate, as well as alternative fates foracetate in the environment (e.g., syntrophic oxidation, assimi-lation into biomass, mineral sorption). Based on carbon iso-
topes alone, CH
4produced at elevated temperatures by the
aceticlastic reaction is likely to appear thermogenic in origin.
The true environmental importance of acetate-derived CH4in
geologic settings remains unclear due to a lack of knowledge
about aceticlastic methanogenesis at elevated temperature andpressure.Theimportanceoftheaceticlasticreactioningeologicsettings cannot be ruled out based on the carbon isotopic
content of the CH
4.
The apparent isotopic equilibration between the carboxyl
position of acetate and CO2observed at early points in Exper -
iment A may help to explain the isotopic composition of
organic acids in petroleum source waters and other geologicsettings. Organic acid samples collected from oil ﬁeld forma-
tion waters in the San Joaquin Basin, for example, display an
enrichment in the carboxyl position relative to the other carbon
positions ( Franks et al., 2001 ), similar to observations here. A
mechanism of microbially catalyzed isotope exchange(O’Leary and Yapp, 1978 ) may account for such observations.
Recent evidence also indicates that acetate produced from
oil-prone source rocks at elevated temperature (200–360°C)
leads directly to
13C-enrichment of the carboxyl position ( Dias
et al., 2002 ). Microbially catalyzed exchange could further act
on organic acids after cooling, altering the initial /H925413C-
Accarboxylby way of exchange with ambient CO2. Isotope
exchange of13C(carboxyl)-labeled acetate has also been ob -
served by de Graaf et al. (1996) in methanogenic, but not
sulﬁdic sediments. Carbon isotope exchange at the carboxyl
position of acetate is known to be catalyzed by acetyl CoAsynthase ( Spormann and Thauer, 1989; Raybuck et al., 1991 ),
andtheequilibriumisotopeeffectfordecarboxylationreactions

13C relative to
CO2) at 25°C and pH 7.5 ( O’Leary and Yapp, 1978 ).

Carbon isotope fractionation experiments with M. marbur-
gensis were designed to determine how environmental factors

2and CH4. Results
from these experiments are summarized in Table 6. These
results fail to demonstrate any signiﬁcant impact of light level,temperature or media organic content on isotopic fractionation.The factor controlling isotope fractionation in these experi-
ments was H
2partial pressure. Low H2partial pressures (Ex -
periments C-1 through C-3) yield large fractionation factors
between CO2and CH4. Increasing the H2partial pressure
(Experiment C-4) results in a decrease in the enrichment factor
by roughly a factor of two. The average /H9251-factor was 1.055 for
experiments with low levels of H2(290–350 Pa H2); the
average /H9251-factor was 1.027 for experiments with elevated lev-
els of H2(8.0/H11003104Pa H2). Previous studies of H2/CO2
methanogenesis with other strains demonstrated a growth-
phase dependence in carbon isotope fractionation. The “H2
effect” observed here is likely related to the “growth-phaseeffect”observedby Botzetal.(1996) andthe“cellspeciﬁcrate
effect” reported by Zyakun (1996) .
3.1.2.1. Differential reversibility. Here we propose that varia-
tions in the carbon isotopic fractionation factor are controlled
by the extent of enzymatic reversibility, and that the extent ofenzymatic reversibility is controlled by the Gibbs Free Energyof catabolism. In essence, we hypothesize that the observed
fractionation factors are indicative of the extent of reversibility
of H
2/CO2methanogenesis under different environmental and
physiologic conditions. The extent of reversibility in multistep
(nonbranching) enzymatic processes, as has been shown fordissimilatory sulfate reduction, impacts the extent to whichfractionations are expressed from each enzymatic step ( Kaplan
and Rittenberg, 1964; Rees, 1973; Detmers et al., 2001 ). While
the fractionation for any given catabolic step remains constant,
the extent to which fractionation is expressed in the ﬁnalproduct depends on the reversibility of the pathway ( Hayes,
1983,2001;Rees,1973 ).WeproposethepartialpressureofH
2
gas is the primary controlling factor on the free energy of
catabolism, and thus on the magnitude of rate constants for
reversereactionsandoncatabolicreversibility.Thishypothesisis outlined schematically in Figure 7.
The Gibbs Free Energy change for H
2/CO2methanogenesis
(Eqn. 2) is approximately /H11002131 kJ mol/H110021under standard
conditions,including105PaH2.Suchconditionsareunusualin
nature, and methanogenesis generally occurs close to the the-
oretical minimum free energy yield ( Lovley, 1985; Cordru-
wisch et al., 1988; Hoehler et al., 2001; Chong et al., 2002;Valentine, 2001 )o f/H1100210 to /H1100220 kJ mol

tabolismiscoupledtoenergyconservation,bywayofachemi-
osmotic potential (equivalent to1⁄4–1⁄3of an ATP; Eqn. 16),
meaning the overall free energy change for Eqn. 16 occurs
close to zero (indicating that thermodynamic efﬁciency ap-proaches 100%) under environmental (H
2-replete) conditions
(Hoehler et al., 1998; Hoehler et al., 2001 ).

Under conditions of excess H2methanogens are capable of
conserving some of the excess energy ( de Poorter et al., 2003 ),
but a larger portion is likely lost in the catabolic pathway and
in concentration gradients ( Sorensen et al., 2001 ). At the ex-
perimental conditions of this study, the Gibbs Free Energyyield ( /H9004G/H11032) for catabolism is calculated to be /H1100297 kJ mol

(assumingreactionbyEqn.16andconditionsfromExperiment

calculations assume the formation of1⁄4ATP requires 20 kJ
mol/H110021.
This “differential reversibility” hypothesis requires that the
ﬁrst ﬁve steps of the methanogenic pathway be fundamentally
reversible under low H2conditions. This assumption is well
supported by a variety of biochemical and environmental data
(Donnelly et al., 1985; DiMarco et al., 1986; Donnelly and
Wolfe, 1986; Schworer and Thauer, 1991; Vorholt and Thauer,
1997; Thauer, 1998; Gartner et al., 1994; Shima et al., 2002 ).
Perhaps the strongest support for this assumption comes fromthe observation that methylotrophic methanogens and sulfate-reducing archaea utilize steps 1–5 in the reverse direction
during catabolism. The sixth step in methanogenesis involves
methyl transfer from H
4MPT to an intermediate, followed by
transfer of that methyl to CoM. The methyl transfer from the
intermediate to CoM is thought to be irreversible ( Gartner et
al.,1993;Gartneretal.,1994 )andwehypothesizethatthisstep
serves as the ultimate isotopic bottleneck during H2/CO2
methanogenesis.
In the case of M. marburgensis the differential reversibility
of catabolism may be further related to the expression of
different enzyme systems under different H2levels (Fig. 8).
ThereductionofCH /H11013H4MPTtoCH2/H11005H4MPT(Fig.8,step
4)islinkedtotheoxidationofH2underconditionofexcessH2,
and is linked to the oxidation of coenzyme F420under limited
H2(Nollingetal.,1995;NollingandReeve,1997;Reeveetal.,1997). The H2-linked reduction of CH /H11013H4MPT to CH2
/H11005H4MPT proceeds with a free energy yield 11 kJ mol/H110021more
exergonic ( Thauer, 1998 ) than the equivalent F420-linked re -
duction.Althoughbothreactionsarereversible,theF420-linked
reaction may be “more” reversible than the H2–linked reaction
due to the difference in activation energies of the reverse
reactions. The less favorable /H9004G/H11032associated with the reversal
oftheH2-linkedreaction(e.g.,theoxidationofCH2/H11005H4MPT
toCH /H11013H4MPT)couldcreateanisotopicbottleneck,allowing
only steps 1–4 to express their full fractionation. In contrast,
greater reversibility of the F420-linked reaction would allow
greater expression of the fractionation associated with steps
1–6.
The idea of differential reversibility in the methanogenic
pathway controlling fractionation can be further applied tophysicaltransportprocessesresponsibleforsupplyingsubstrateto the cell. We have previously considered the possibility ofhigh metabolic rates causing a closed-system effect with re-
spect to intracellular CO
2(e.g., a steady-state isotopic enrich -
ment in the intracellular CO2pool;Valentine, 2000 ). This
mechanism is effectively a physical analog of the chemical
reaction discussed above and has been considered quantita-tively for other metabolic systems ( Rees, 1973; Hayes, 1983,
2001). Basically, high cell-speciﬁc metabolic rates may draw
down the intracellular concentration of CO
2, effectively creat -
ingasituationofirreversibleﬂuxintothecell(onceCO2enters
the cell there is no fate but conversion to CH4– thus no net
fractionation is possible). This idea is consistent with results
presented here, and could well act in concert with differentialreversibility of the catabolic pathway.
Fig. 7.Schematic representation of the Gibbs Free Energy change associated with catabolism during H2/CO2
methanogenesis (Eqn. 16), focusing on the activation energies for the forward and reverse reactions. Each of the seven
catabolic reactions (shown at bottom and in Fig. 8) are outlined for conditions of excess H2(top) and limited H2
(lower). Under conditions of excess H2, the activation energies for the reverse reactions (given as E /H11033#) are greater than
the activation energies for the forward reactions (given as E#). Under conditions of limited H2, the activation energies
for the forward (E#) and reverse (E /H11033#) reactions are similar. The reaction rate constants will therefore change in
response to the change in /H9004G/H11032(according to the Arrhenius equation). Reversibility is more likely to be achieved under
limited H2conditions. This model assumes reversibility of the enzymatic pathway until step 6, and each step includes
energetic couplings (see Thauer, 1998 , for energetic details of each step). This ﬁgure represents all the activation
energies as being equal, which is unlikely; each step likely consists of multiple peaks and valleys. Greater differentialsbetween forward and reverse activation energies are expected for reductive/oxidative steps (1, 4, 5 and 7). Late stagesof growth resemble low H
2conditions because rapid H2consumption by dense cultures draws the dissolved and
intracellular H2lower, and the /H9004G/H11032experienced by the organism is decreased (e.g., much of the /H9004G/H11032is lost to the H2
concentration gradient; Sorenson et al., 2001 ). MF /H11005methanofuran, H4MPT /H11005tetrahydromethanopterin, CoM /H11005
coenzyme M. Further details on the biochemistry and enzymology of methanogenesis are given in Figure 8.1582 D. L. Valentine et al.The “differential reversibility” hypothesis predicts that a
variety of factors impact the fractionation of carbon isotopes
during H2/CO2methanogenesis, including enzyme expression
patterns, cell-speciﬁc catabolic rate, cell density, kinetics of H2
transport, energy conservation mechanisms, and the /H9004G/H11032of
catabolism. Furthermore, the fractionation associated with H2/
CO2methanogenesis is likely to vary between species. Despite
these many complications, the “differential reversibility” effect
may hold true across a variety of environmental conditions, as
it correctly predicts that methanogens in energy stressed envi-ronments (such as permanently cold marine sediments) tend todisplay larger fractionation factors than do methanogens in
other environments, such as the rumen. This effect is prevalent
during dissimilatory sulfate reduction and during H
2/CO2
methanogenesis, both anaerobic processes proceeding with
minimal Free Energy yields. This effect may also be prevalent
in other forms of “low energy” anaerobic metabolism such asaceticlastic methanogenesis, homoacetogenesis, anaerobic CH
4
oxidation, iron (III) reduction and fermentation.
3.1.2.2. Relation to previous studies. Observations of H2-de-
pendentfractionationofcarbonisotopesduringH2/CO2metha-
nogenesis (Experiment C) may be used to critically analyze
previouslypublishedfractionationfactors.Severalearlystudies
ofisotopicfractionation( Gamesetal.,1978;Fuchsetal.,1979;
Belyaevetal.,1983;Balabaneetal.,1987;Krzyckietal.,1987;Botz et al., 1996 ) considered methanogenesis under high H
2levels, and in early stages of growth ( Table 5). Such results
may be biased by the choice of experimental conditions, and
may not represent the range of fractionations achieved by theseorganisms in nature. In particular, Fuchs et al. (1978) reported
a fractionation factor of 1.034 for the same strain as was usedin this study.
3.2. Hydrogen Isotope Fractionation
3.2.1. Methanogenesis from acetate
Studies of hydrogen isotope fractionation arising from the
aceticlastic reaction were designed to quantify the impact of
/H9254D-Acetate, /H9254D-H2O and the isotope effect on the /H9254Do ft h e
resulting CH4. However, technical problems with the quan -
tiﬁcation of /H9254D in acetate only allow for comparison of
/H9254D-H2O with /H9254D-CH4. Results comparing the /H9254D-CH4pro-
duced by M. thermophila (Experiments B-1 through B-4)
with the /H9254D-H2O in the culture media are given in Figure 9.
The regression analysis (R2/H110050.996) is given for Experi -
ments B-1, B-2, and B-3, which were amended with the
same stock solution of acetate. Results from Experiment B-4
are also given, though data is not included in the regressionanalysis because the bottles were amended with acetate froma different source than in Experiments B-1 through B-3. Theslope of the regression line indicates that 19% of the CH
4-
bound hydrogen originates from a source in isotopic equi-

value of 25%. This calculation assumes all acetate has the
same initial /H9254D, and that D/H fractionation is constant
during addition of the fourth hydrogen. The methyl position
of acetate can only supply up to 75% of the CH4-bound
hydrogen ( Fig. 6; 3 hydrogen atoms), and other sources of
hydrogen (not in isotopic equilibrium with H2O) are not
certain. The Y intercept of the curve ( /H11002259‰) is represen-
tative of both the acetate substrate ( /H9254D-Ac) and the kinetic
isotope effect associated with the aceticlastic reaction.
Given the uncertainties in quantiﬁcation of /H9254D-Ac, we are
unable to further constrain these two primary factors. De-
spite the use of different stock solution, the results from
strain PTare similar to those from strain CALS-1.
Onepossiblecauseofthedifﬁcultyinaccuratelyquantifying
/H9254D in acetate is that of isotope exchange. Hydrogen atoms
bound to a carbon adjacent to a carboxyl group are able to
exchange with H2O (protons) through a keto-enol tautomeriza -
tion reaction ( Amyes and Richard, 1996; Richard et al., 2002 ).
ExchangeoccursmorerapidlyatlowpH,andratesarelikelyto
also be dependent on temperature. Because acetate puriﬁcation
was performed in aqueous solution at pH 3, we suspect someD/Hexchangebetweenwaterandacetatemayhaveoccurredatthis step. The linear correlation (0.19) between
/H9254D-CH4and
/H9254D-H2O(Fig. 9) indicates little exchange occurred during heat
sterilization and early growth. Rapid exchange has been ob-
servedinanoxicmethanogenic(butnotsulﬁdic)sediments,and
has been attributed to enzymatically mediated exchange ( de
Graaf et al., 1996 ).
3.2.2. Methanogenesis from H2/CO2
Hydrogen isotope experiments with M. marburgensis (D-1,
D-2) were performed to determine whether varying /H9254D-H2
would impact /H9254D-CH4at conditions with a constant /H9254D-H2O.
In Experiments D-1 and D-2, H2gas was supplied with two
distinctive values of /H9254D-H2,/H11002692 and /H11002190‰, respectively.
Results of these two experiments are presented in Figures 10
and11, respectively. The isotopic fractionation between H2O
and CH4was constant at 270–275‰ ( /H9251/H110051.43) in the latter
halfofExperimentD-1.The /H9254D-H2remainedconstantthrough -
out Experiment D-1 and did not deviate measurably from thevalue of the source H
2(/H11002692‰). The difference between H2Oand CH4was more variable in Experiment D-2, ranging from
/H11002127 to /H11002275‰ ( /H9251/H110051.16–1.43). The magnitude of the
fractionation was dependent on the growth phase of the culturewith fractionation increasing throughout the exponential
growth phase, and ﬁnally stabilizing at a difference of 275‰
during the stationary phase. The
/H9254D-H2of the residual H2
exitingthevesselvariedthroughoutExperimentD-2,followingthe same pattern as the
/H9254D-CH4produced during the experi -
ment. The /H9254D-H2of the residual H2was initially similar to the
source H2(/H11002190‰), and became more depleted over the
course of the experiment to a ﬁnal /H9254D-H2of/H11002263‰. At the
maximum rate of metabolism, during stationary phase, less
than 8% of the total H2supplied to the vessel was consumed.

Hydrogen isotope experiments were also performed with M.
marburgensis (D-3) to determine the impact of temperature on
/H9254D-CH4at a constant /H9254D-H2(supplied) and /H9254D-H2O. Results
are presented in Figure 12 . The/H9254Do fC H4produced by the
cultureisstronglycorrelatedwithboththeCH4productionrate
and the temperature (R2of 0.92 and 0.90, respectively). The
residual /H9254D-H2exiting the vessel also correlates strongly with
both the CH4production rate and temperature (R2of 0.88 and
0.89, respectively). Assuming no signiﬁcant changes in cell
density over the course of this experiment, the isotopic frac-tionations observed in this experiment also correlate to the
cell-speciﬁc metabolic rate. This assumption is supported bytherelativelyshort(7h)durationofthisexperiment,andbythesimilarity in CH
4production rates at the beginning of the
experiment and afte r 6 h (both at 65°C).
3.2.2.1. The source of CH4-bound hydrogen. Experiments on
H2/CO2methanogenesis (Experiment D) were designed to test
whether the /H9254D-H2supplied to methanogens impacts the /H9254D-
CH4produced, at constant /H9254D-H2O. The maximal observed
fractionation factor ( /H9251) between CH4and H2O was 1.43, and
was independent of the /H9254D-H2provided. These results suggest,
but do not prove, /H9254D-H2O is the primary factor controlling
/H9254D-CH4produced by M. marburgensis during the stationary
phase of growth. Our results are consistent with those or
Daniels et al. (1980) who used 81 atom% deuterated H2Ot o

3.2.2.2. /H9254D-CH4growth phase effect. A signiﬁcant “growth
phase” effect was observed in Experiment D-2 ( Fig. 11). Frac-
tionation factors ranged from 1.16 early in the experiment andshowed a gradual increase to a maximum of 1.43 late in theexperiment. Experiment D-3 further linked variations in frac-tionation (1.24 /H11349
/H9251/H113491.42) to temperature and/or catabolic
rate (Fig. 12). We suggest the observed variations in /H9254D-CH4
are caused primarily by changes in the enzymatic addition of
hydrogen to the carbon substrate. As seen in Figure 8 and
discussed in section 3.1.2.1, M. marburgensis is capable of
producing multiple enzymes which perform the same catabolicfunction. One such function is the reduction of methenyl-
H
4MPT to methylene-H4MPT, which involves the addition of
a hydrogen atom to the carbon substrate ( Fig. 8, step 4). Two
enzymes are capable of performing this reaction, and their
regulation is controlled by H2availability and/or growth phase
(Nolling et al., 1995; Nolling and Reeve, 1997; Reeve et al.,
1997).
The ﬁrst enzyme (H2-forming N5,N10-methylenetetrahy -
dromethanopterin dehydrogenase) receives reducing power di-rectly from H
2and is preferentially expressed at early stages of
growth and under conditions of excess H2. This enzyme cata -
lyzestheheterolyticcleavageofH2andthesubsequenthydride
shift to a conjugated carbocation reaction center ( Schleucher et
al., 1994; Klein et al., 1995b; Hartmann et al., 1996; Thauer et
al., 1996). Hydrogen from H2is afﬁxed directly to the growing
methane moiety, though isotope exchange occurs ( Schworer et
al.,1993;Kleinetal.,1995a ,b;Hartmannetal.,1996 ).Thereis
no deuterium isotope effect associated with this reaction ( Klein
et al., 1995b ).
The second enzyme (coenzyme F420-dependent N5,N10-
methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase) receives
reducing power from the reduced form of coenzyme F420, and
is expressed under conditions of H2limitation. This enzyme
catalyzes a reversible face-speciﬁc hydride transfer. The ex-
pressionpatternoftheseenzymes( Nollingetal.,1995;Nolling
and Reeve, 1997; Reeve et al., 1997 ) matches the observed
variability in /H9251(H2O/CH4).
One possible mechanism by which these enzymes could
impact the /H9254D-CH4involves distinctive fractionations associ -
ated with the H2- and F420-linked enzymes. Greater fraction -
ation associated with hydrogen addition by way of F420is
consistentwithexperimentalobservations,andcouldberelated
to the two-step reduction, ﬁrst from H2to F420H2(Nambiar et
al., 1983; Yamazake et al., 1985; Schauer et al., 1986; Klein
and Thauer, 1995 ) and then to methylene-H4MPT. During the
early stages of Experiment D-2 the observed fractionation
during CH4production was rather small ( /H9251/H110051.16), as might
beexpectediftheH2-linkedenzymeisdominantandexpresses
no fractionation. The experimental results are consistent with
the F420-linked enzyme expressing an /H9251(H2O/CH4)o f/H110112.1,
assuming all other fractionations remain constant and no fur-
ther isotope exchange.3.2.2.3. Hydrogenase efﬁciency. Results from Experiment D
canbefurtherusedtoconstrainH2activationandreleasebythe
action of hydrogenase. The isotopic evidence clearly indicates
the hydrogenase system is not completely efﬁcient, as the H2
leaving the culture vessel is depleted in deuterium relative to
the H2entering the vessel; hydrogenase enzymes are well
knownforrapidreversibilityandforcatalysisofD-Hexchange
between H2and water ( Rose, 1970 ). The efﬁciency of the
hydrogenase system, E, can be estimated using the experimen-
tal data, by assuming a fractionation for the formation of H2
from H2O,/H9251(H2O-H2), and a fractionation for the uptake of H2
by hydrogenase ( /H9251c). The mass balance is detailed in section
2.4.4. Although one uptake hydrogenase (H2-forming N5,N10-
methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase, as in sec-
tion 3.2.2.2) displays no fractionation during H2uptake (e.g., /H9251
/H110051;Klein et al., 1995b ), it is likely other uptake hydrogenases
inM. marburgensis exhibit greater fractionation factors.
Figure 13a displays the relationship between the isotopic
fractionation for H2production, /H9251(H2O-H2), and the efﬁciency
of the hydrogenase system (E), at three different values of /H9251c.
Results indicate the hydrogenase system in M. marburgensis is
highly inefﬁcient, even as /H9251(H2O-H2) approaches 10. Likely
values of /H9251(H2O-H2) are at least 3 and possibly higher. As -
suming an /H9251(H2O-H2) of 3.1 (which also corresponds to the
equilibrium isotope fractionation factor for H2/H2Oa t6 5 ° C ;
Horibe and Craig, 1995 ),M. marburgensis (as observed in this
study) would activate 8 H2molecules for each CH4produced;
one H2molecule would be released for every one catabolized.
Results also indicate signiﬁcant variations in uptake efﬁciency
at different temperatures ( Fig. 13b). The hydrogenase system
appearsmosteffectiveat65°C,theoptimalgrowthtemperature
for this strain, and is least efﬁcient at 45°C. There is also apossibility that the efﬁciency of the hydrogenase system isdependent on growth phase, though the data is not sufﬁcient toprove this.
3.2.2.4. Environmentalrelevance. SugimotoandWada(1995)
performedaseriesofincubationexperimentswithpaddysoiltodiscern the relationship between
/H9254D-H2O and /H9254D-CH4in an
environmentwherebothH2/CO2andacetateareimportantCH4
precursors. These authors attributed temporal variations in /H9254D-
CH4to changes in the relative contributions of acetate versus
H2/CO2methanogenesis, and used such variations to estimate
the fraction of CH4derived from H2/CO2versus acetate. Sugi-
moto and Wada (1995) observed increasing fractionation be-
tween /H925413C-CH4//H925413C-CO2and between /H9254D-CH4//H9254D-H2O
over the course of their incubations. Results presented here
raise a further possibility that such variations were caused by
changes in substrate availability for the methanogenic commu-nity over the course of the incubation, as results from Experi-ments C and D are consistent with their observations. Changes
in the structure of the methanogenic community might also
impact temporal variation in
/H9254D-CH4(Chidthaisong et al.,
2002).
Few culture studies have considered hydrogen isotope frac-
tionation during H2/CO2methanogenesis. Calculations using
data presented by Balabane et al. (1987) indicate a hydrogen
isotope fractionation of 1.67 /H110060.05 between source H2O and
the resulting CH4for pure cultures of Methanobacterium for -1586 D. L. Valentine et al.micicum.ResultsfromExperimentDindicatethisfractionation
may serve as an upper limit for this strain, but that lesserfractionations may be observed at other environmental/growthconditions.
Results from H
2/CO2experiments (Experiment D) may help
to explain a long-standing discrepancy between the /H9254D-CH4in
biogenic natural gas reservoirs and the /H9254D-CH4from terrestrial
environments and ruminants. Biogenic natural gas (CH4) tends
tobedepletedbyonly /H11011160‰relativetosourceH2O(Schoell,
1980), whereas CH4produced in wetlands and ruminants tends
tobedepletedby300–400‰relativetosourceH2O(Sugimoto
and Wada, 1995; Waldron et al., 1999; Bilek et al., 2001;
Chidthaisongetal.,2002 ).Adepletionof160‰fallswithinthe
range observed in this study ( Figs. 11and12). A large propor-
tion of biogenic natural gas is formed in moderately thermal
environments, where organisms such as M. marburgensis are
active (Orphan et al., 2000 ). Thus, results from this study are
consistent with moderately themophilic H2/CO2methanogensas producers of biogenic natural gas with a relatively enriched
deuterium content.
Results from Experiment D can be used to consider the
hypothesis proposed by Burke (1993) that hydrogen isotopic
fractionation during H2/CO2methanogenesis in nature is con -
trolled by ambient H2levels, and that high H2levels are
correlated to deuterium-depleted CH4. The proposed mecha -
nism behind this hypothesis is the depletion of the intracellular
H2OpoolbyH2uptakeunderhighH2conditions.Resultsfrom
ExperimentD-2indicatethatnaturalvariabilityassociatedwith
growth phase and variations in the catabolic pathway are likelyto play a dominant role in controlling the
/H9254Do fC H4produced.
These results further demonstrate large variations in /H9254D-CH4,
at constant extra-cellular H2concentration.
4. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Methane produced from acetate by M. thermophila at ele-
vated temperatures is fractionated only slightly in13C(/H110117‰)
from the methyl position of acetate. Given the potential impor-
tance of thermophilic Methanosaeta in nature, biogenic CH4
produced from acetate at elevated temperature may be easily
mistaken for thermogenically derived CH4based on carbon
isotopes alone.
Methane produced by H2/CO2methanogenesis at elevated
temperature displays a broad range of carbon isotope fraction-
ation(/H9251)factors,rangingfrom1.023to1.064.LowlevelsofH2
and steady-state metabolism yield greater isotopic fraction-
ations.Weproposethatdifferentialreversibilityinthecatabolic
pathway, driven by changes in the activation energies forindividual catabolic steps, provides the most consistent expla-nation of these results. This “differential reversibility” hypoth-
esis is further consistent with a variety of pure culture and
environmental observations.
Fractionation during H
2/CO2methanogenesis is commonly
referred to as a kinetic isotope effect. If the differential revers-
ibility hypothesis holds true, the fractionation arising fromH
2/CO2methanogenesis is better described as a mixed kinetic
and equilibrium isotope effect. It is possible the equilibrium
component of the isotope effect is greater than the kinetic.
The/H9254DofCH4derivedfromH2/CO2atelevatedtemperature
is highly variable, even within one species, with fractionation
(/H9251) factors ranging from 1.16 to 1.43. The extent of fraction-
ation appears to be controlled by the catabolic rate, and is thus
dependent on environmental conditions. The biochemical basisfor this “growth phase effect” may be linked to variations in
expression of hydrogenase isoenzymes or cell-speciﬁc meta-
bolic rate. The relatively small fractionation between H
2O and
CH4at high temperature is consistent with environmental data
andcanbeusedtoexplaintherelativedeuteriumenrichmentof
many biogenic gas reservoirs compared to CH4produced at
moderate temperatures.
HydrogenisotopicfractionationbetweenH2OandH2occurs
rapidly, on the order of seconds, in the presence of H2-me-
tabolising microbes. This evidence indicates that uptake of
hydrogen by M. marburgensis is a readily reversible process.
Calculations based on experimental results indicate that thehydrogenase system in M. marburgensis is less than 50%
efﬁcient, meaning that less than half the H
2molecules (reduc -
ing equivalents) taken up by M. marburgensis are converted to
