Abstract
Introduction
We present a study aimed at assess -
ing the ability of Pseudomonas spp. 
to decolourize and degrade methyl orange dye. Pseudomonas spp. could tolerate methyl orange dye for up to 500 mg
–1.
Materials and methodsA bacterium identified as Pseu-
domonas spp. was isolated from dye-contaminated soil. This strain rapidly decolourized a methyl orange azo dye solution. Features of the decol-ourizing process related to biodeg-radation and biosorption were also studied. ResultsThe dye was efficiently decolour-ized in static compared with shaken cultures. The bacterium exhibited a remarkable colour-removal capabil -
ity over a wide range of dye concen-trations (50–200 mg/l), pH (6–10) and temperatures (30–40
°C). The 
Pseudomonas spp.  decolourized the 
repeated addition of methyl orange dye for up to four cycles with variable decolourization rates (10–94%).ConclusionThe strain can tolerate and decolour -
ize azo dyes at high concentrations, making it an advantage for treatment of textile industry wastewaters. How -
ever, the strain needs to be tested on the treatment of real dye-bearing wastewaters using appropriate bio-reactors.Introduction
Rapid industrialization has necessi -
tated the manufacture and use of dif -
ferent chemicals in day-to-day life1,2. 
The textile industry extensively uses synthetic chemicals as dyes. Waste-waters from textile industries pose a threat to the environment, as large amount of chemically different dyes are used. A significant proportion of these dyes enter the environment via wastewater
1. Approximately 10,000 
different dyes and pigments are used industrially, and over 0.7 million tons of synthetic dyes are produced annu -
ally, worldwide
3. Pollution, due to the 
textile industry, effluent has increased during recent years. Moreover, it is very difficult to treat textile industry effluents because of their high BOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD), heat, colour, pH and the presence of metal ions
4. The textile finishing generates a 
large amount of wastewater contain -
ing dyes and represents one of the largest causes of water pollution
5, as 
10–15% of dyes are lost in the efflu -
ent during the dyeing process6. The 
traditional textile finishing industry consumes about 100 l of water to process about 1 kg of textile mate -
rial. The new closed-loop technologies such as the re-use of microbial or en-zymatic treatment of dyeing effluents could help in reducing this enormous amount of water pollution
7. Azo dyes 
have been used increasingly in indus -
tries because of their ease and cost-  
effectiveness in synthesis compared with natural dyes. However, most azo dyes are toxic, carcinogenic and muta -
genic
8. Azo bonds present in these com -
pounds are resistant to breakdown, with the potential for persistence and 
accumulation in the  en vironment9. 
However, they can be degraded by bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic conditions
10. Several physicochemical 
techniques have been proposed for the treatment of coloured textile effluents. These include adsorption on different 
materials, oxidation and  pr ecipitation 
by Fenton’s reagent, bleaching with chloride or ozone photo degradation or membrane filtration
11. All these 
physical or chemical methods are very expensive and result in the pro -
duction of large amounts of sludge, which creates the secondary level of land pollution. Therefore, economic and safe removal of the polluting dyes is still an important issue. Bioreme -
diation through microorganisms has been identified as a cost-effective and environment-friendly alternative for disposal of textile effluent
12,13. In re -
cent years, a  number of studies ha ve 
focused on some microorganisms ca -
pable of degrading and absorbing dyes from wastewater. A wide variety of mi -
croorganisms are reported to be capa -
ble of decolonization of dyes
14–26. The 
current study evaluated the potential of the isolated bacterial strain from textile effluent for its decolourization efficiency of the textile dye methyl 
 orange (MO). 
Materials and methods
The protocol of this study has been approved by the relevant ethical committee related to our institution in which it was performed.
Screening of decolourizers
Soil near to textile industrial outlet was used as a source for enrichment and isolation of decolourizers. The screening medium (SM) contained peptone, 10g; meat extract, 10g and NaCl, 5g in 1 l of distilled water with 0.5 g of MO. MO dye was sterilized

 concentrations of glucose/peptone 
from 1% to 5% and 150 mg/l of dye 
were used29.
Change in absorption spectra 
during dye decolourization
The change in peak in absorption spec -
trum reveals the dye adsorption or bio -
degradation during decolourization by 
isolate. Variation of UV-visible spectra 
of azo dye solution at a concentration 
of 150 mg/l MO with Pseudomonas 
spp. was checked at 0, 24 and 48 h in -
tervals spectrophotometrically27.
Assimilation of dye
An attempt was carried out to test 
the isolate ability to decolourize 150 
mg/l MO in mineral medium deplet -
ed of carbon or nitrogen or both. The 
decolourization was read spectro -
photometrically after 48 h30.
Fed batch decolourization of MO 
by isolate
The fed batch decolourization of MO 
dye was also studied; in this study 
150 mg/l dye was added into the 
24-h grown culture of bacterial iso -
late. After decolourization, 150 mg/l 
dye was added into the decolour -
ized broth without supplement of 
additional nutrient. Dye was added 
continuously until the culture did 
not lose decolourization ability. The 
dye concentration was determined 
by monitoring the absorbance of dye 
spectrophotometrically31.
Decolourization of azo dyes in 
consortium
Different azo dyes viz. methyl red, 
MO and Congo red at the final con -
centration of 150 mg/l was used in 
SM with isolate, and dye reduction 
was checked spectrophotometrically 
for 4 days at 24-h intervals.
Results
Data in Figure 1 depict that at the low -
est dye concentration (50–200 mg/l), 
the dye was decolourized more than 
84% after 4 days incubation. As the 
dye concentration  increased in the bacterial cell mass, and the clear su -
pernatant was used to measure the 
decolourization at the absorbance 
maxima of the dye. Abiotic controls 
(without microorganism) were al -
ways included29.
The percentage decolourization 
was calculated as follows:
Effect of dye concentration
The various concentrations of dye 
(50, 100 150, 250 and 400 mg/l) 
were added into the culture medi -
um in order to examine the effect of 
initial dye on the decolourization in 
static conditions at various time in -
tervals29.
Effect of temperature
The inoculated SM was incubated 
at various temperatures (10, 32, 37 
and 50°C) in static conditions for 48 
h. The effect of temperature on dye 
decolourization was checked spec -
trophotometrically after 48 h30.
Effect of pH of culture medium
The pH of the inoculated SM was 
adjusted to 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 with 
1 M HCl or 1M NaOH. The effect of pH 
on dye decolourization was checked 
spectrophotometrically after 48 h30.
Decolourization at static and 
shaking conditions
Decolourization ability of bacterial 
isolate was tested in shaking and stat -
ic conditions at optimum pH (7.0) and 
temperature (32°C) using SM with 
150 mg/l of MO. The supernatant was 
withdrawn at intervals of 24 h for 4 
days and was used for analysis of COD 
and decolourization. Decolourization 
was monitored spectrophotometri -
cally and COD was determined ac -
cording to the standard method31.
Effect of glucose and peptone on 
dye decolourization
To study the effect of carbon and 
nitrogen sources on decolouriza -
tion of MO, mineral medium with 
trace  element addition and varied by passing it through a 0.45-μm pore 
size filter, while other components 
were sterilized at 121°C for 20 min. 
Ten grams of soil was then added to 
a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 
100 ml of SM. The cultures were in -
cubated at 32°C on a rotary shaker at 
120 rpm. Next, the broth of the decol -
ourized flask was transferred to fresh 
SM to screen the strain having col -
our-removing ability. The screening  
procedure in the liquid culture was 
conducted repeatedly until a decol -
ourized culture occurred. A small 
amount of decolourized broth was 
then poured into an agar plate con -
taining SM, and it was incubated at 
32°C. Colonies surrounded by decol -
ourized zones were selected. Isolates 
were then tested for their colour-  
removal ability in a submerged cul -
ture, and the best isolate was selected. 
Finally, identification of the isolate 
was done by Bergey’s Manual of De -
terminative Bacteriology (2000)27,28.
Dyes
MO was procured from a local dye in -
dustry (Ankleshwar, Gujarat,  India). 
Dye was checked for its colour, solu -
bility in water, ethanol and absorp -
tion maximum. Stock solution of 
6,000 ppm was prepared by dissolv -
ing the dye in distilled water and was 
filter sterilized and kept at 4°C. Dyes 
at different concentrations (50, 100, 
150, 200, 400 and 500 ppm) were 
used to study their effect on bacterial 
growth and adsorption after adding 
to the culture media.
Decolourization experiments
All decolourization experiments 
were performed in three sets. The 
culture with OD 0.699 at 540 nm at a 
concentration of 4% was inoculated 
in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask contain -
ing 100 ml SM and incubated at 32°C 
for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, the 
dye was added at a concentration of 
150 mg/l, and 3 ml of the culture me -
dia was withdrawn at different time 
intervals. Aliquot was centrifuged at 
6,000 rpm for 10 min to separate the Page 3 of 7

(6–10) with the optimum pH being 
8 (80% dye decolourization). A large 
decrease in decolourization occurs at 
high acidic pH (2–4) (Figure 3). This 
is an advantage of this bacterium for 
developing a practical bioprocess in 
treating dyeing mill effluents. Hence 
the bacteria are preferred over fungi 
for dye decolourization. The pattern 
of MO decolourization in static as 
well as in shaken cultures was eluci -
dated in the medium. Figure 4 shows 
that lower decolourization percent -
ages were exhibited in shaken cul -
tures compared with static ones. 
Maximal efficiency of MO decolouri -
zation (86%) was achieved in 4 days 
when incubated statically. These ob -
servations suggest that the decolour -
ization performance of Pseudomonas 
spp. was better in the presence of low 
oxygen content. The reason could 
be due to competition of abundant 
oxygen and the azo compounds for 
the reduced electron carriers under 
aerobic conditions. The cell growth 
in shaking condition was higher than 
static conditions, but there was less 
decolourization (65%) with more 
COD removal (48%) under shaking 
conditions and more decolourization 
(86%) with less COD removal (25%) 
under static condition within 4 days 
(data not shown). These findings are of  Pseudomonas spp.  and hence per -
centage of decolourization decreas -
es. The variation in pH of the growth 
medium results in change in activity 
of bacteria and hence the bacterial 
growth rate as well as decolouriza -
tion. Bacteria are active over a cer -
tain range of pH. In contrast with 
other decolourizing microbes like 
fungi with a narrow pH range, Pseu -
domonas spp . cells proved to be of 
desirable characteristics, removing 
MO colour over a wide range of pH culture medium, a decline in colour 
removal was attained. This might 
be attributed to the toxicity of dye 
to bacterial cells through the inhibi -
tion of metabolic activity, saturation 
of the cells with dye products, inac -
tivation of transport system of the 
dye or the blockage of active sites of 
azo reductase enzymes by the dye 
molecules. Under given experimen -
tal conditions, 60% decolourization 
was attained upon using 500 mg/l 
of the dye after 4 days. Bacterial 
growth in the presence of MO was 
also studied using control without 
dye, which showed the dye has an 
inhibitory effect on growth of bac -
teria as the number of bacteria was 
decreased in the presence of MO as 
compared with the control without 
dye (data not shown). The rate of 
chemical reaction is a direct func -
tion of temperature. Bacteria require 
optimum temperature for growth. 
The operating temperature of the 
incubation process varied between 
10°C, 30°C, 37°C and 50°C, to study 
the effect of temperature on the de -
colourization process ( Figure 2). 
At temperatures below 37°C, due to 
slow growth of the  bacteria, it took 
more days for  decolourization, and at 
temperatures above 37°C, the activity

consistent with the results shown 
by Ozdemir et al.33 who suggested 
COD removal is more under shak -
ing conditions. Addition of a carbon 
source such as glucose at different 
concentrations has an effect on the 
percentage of decolourization (data 
not shown). The concentration of 
glucose varied from 1% to 5%, and 
it was found that the percentage of 
Figure 3:  Effect of pH on decolourization by Pseudomonas spp .
decolourization increases with the 
increase in concentration of glucose 
due to decrease in lag period. The 
percentage decolourization decreas -
es with the increase in concentration 
of peptone up to a maximum pep -
tone concentration of 1% (75% dye 
 decolourization) after which there 
is a decrease in percentage of decol -
ourization. Results obtained in the presence of different heavy metals 
are shown in Figure 5. Data indicate 
that the process of colour removal is 
significantly inhibited by the pres -
ence of mercuric chloride (11%) and 
potassium dichromate (12%), espe -
cially during the initial period (1–2 
days) of the incubation. Marginal in -
hibition in colour uptake is noticed 
by the presence of silver nitrate, 
zinc sulphate and cadmium chloride. 
Hence the bacteria are able to toler -
ate the toxic effect of silver nitrate, 
zinc sulphate and cadmium chloride 
to achieve decolourization. Slow 
rates of colour uptake in the pres -
ence of chromium and mercury may 
be related to heavy metal inhibition 
of enzymes and metabolic pathways. 
Similar data were reported by Sum -
athi et al. (2001)34 who studied the 
effects of Cr+6 on Aspergillus  foetidus  
in the decolourization of Procion 
dyes. Results display the change of 
UV-visible spectra of MO, using the 
supernatant fluid of the culture at 0, 
24 and 48 h (data not shown). The 
absorbance peak at 440 nm disap -
pears after cultivation. The fed batch 
decolourization study was carried 
out to check the ability of isolate for 
the decolourization of repeated add -
ed dye. The Pseudomonas spp . decol -
ourized the repeated addition of MO 
dye for up to four cycles (each 24 h) 
with variable decolourization rates 
(10–94%). In the first cycle, 93% 
decolourization occurred and in the 
second cycle 70% decolourization 
occurred, and the decolourization 
percentage keeps decreasing (up to 
10% at fourth cycle) as the number 
of cycles increases (data not shown). 
Our isolate also has the ability to de -
colourize the following azo dyes viz. 
MO, methyl red, Congo red and tar -
trazine in consortium.  Figures  6 and 
7 depict that it can decolourize these 
mixed dyes up to 75 % in 4 days.
Discussion
Industrial effluent is not stable, and it 
varies often in a wide range depend -
ing on the process practiced. South

of these wastes into receiving waters 
causes damage to the  environment. 
Dyes may significantly affect pho -
tosynthetic activity in aquatic life 
because of reduced light penetra -
tion and may also be toxic to some 
aquatic life due to the presence of 
aromatics, metals, chlorides, etc. 
Synthetic dyes are extensively used 
in the textile and printing industries. 
Azo dyes are the most important 
group of synthetic colourants. These 
are the largest class of dyes and more 
than half of the annually produced 
dyes. Dye  wastewater from textile 
or dye stuff industry is one of the 
most difficult to treat because dyes 
have various synthetic origins and 
they contain complex aromatic mo -
lecular structures, which make them 
more stable and more difficult to be 
degraded. The removal of dyes from 
the textile waste effluent has been 
carried out by physical and chemi -
cal methods, such as flocculation, 
membrane filtration,  electrochemical 
techniques,  ozonation, coagulation 
and adsorption. In recent years, a 
number of studies have focused on 
some microorganisms, which are 
able to biodegrade and biosorb dyes 
in  wastewaters. A wide variety of mi -
croorganisms capable of decolouriz -
ing a wide range of dyes include some 
bacteria, fungi and algae. The use of 
microorganisms for the  removal of 
synthetic dyes from industrial efflu -
ents offers considerable advantages. 
The process is relatively inexpensive, 
it is a simple method, the running 
costs are low and the end products of 
complete mineralization are not tox -
ic. The present study was designed 
to test decolourization of azo dye 
by bacteria isolated from the textile 
effluent drainage site. For this pur -
pose, soil near textile effluent outlets 
was collected, and enrichment and 
isolation for azo dye-decolourizing  
bacteria was carried out in SM con -
taining azo dye. Microorganism 
showing maximum decolourization 
in less time was selected and using

Asian countries are experiencing 
severe environmental problems due 
to rapid industrialization. This phe -
nomenon is very common where the 
polluting industries like textile dye -
ing, leather tanning, paper and pulp 
processing, sugar manufacturing, 
etc. thrive as clusters. Among these, 
the textile industries are large indus -
trial consumers of waters as well as producers of wastewater. The efflu -
ent discharged by this industry leads 
to serious pollution of groundwater 
and soils and ultimately affects the 
livelihood of the poor32. The textile 
industry is an industry that gener -
ates a high volume of wastewater. 
Strong colour of the textile wastewa -
ter is the most serious problem of the 
textile waste effluent. The disposal Page 6 of 7

by biological degradation associated 
with a minor portion of the dye ad -
sorbing onto the cell surface. Identifi -
cation and toxicity study of products 
from the degradation of MO dye by 
Pseudomonas spp . is now in progress. 
This observation has established 
that the bacteria are adaptive in na -
ture and can degrade contaminants. 
The ability of the strain to tolerate 
and decolourize azo dyes at high con -
centration gives it an advantage for 
treatment of textile industry waste -
waters. However, the potential of the 
strain needs to be demonstrated for 
its application in the treatment of 
real dye-bearing wastewaters using  
appropriate bioreactors.

Decolorization and detoxification of tex -
tile dyes with a laccase from Trametes Bacteriology (2000) was identified 
as Pseudomonas spp.  The time course 
of MO  decolourization was studied 
at  different initial concentrations 
(50–500 mg/l) in static cultures. 
Dye decolourization is a metabolic 
process that causes a shift in tem -
perature from optimum results into 
a decrease in dye decolourization 
as high temperature causes thermal 
inactivation of proteins and possibly 
of cell structures such as the mem -
brane. Also, to achieve an effective 
colour removal, agitation and vigor -
ous aeration should be avoided. The 
decreased decolourization results 
from nitrate or nitrite, a reducing 
equivalent that cells generated from 
peptone consumption. These metab -
olites of nitrate/nitrite may compete 
with the azo dye and result in less 
decolourization (data not shown). 
In addition to a complex mixture of 
dyes, the textile mill effluents often 
contain heavy metals, which gener -
ally affect the uptake and metabo -
lism of azo dyes. Decolourization of 
the dye solution by bacteria could be 
due to adsorption to microbial cells 
or to biodegradation35. In adsorption, 
examination of the absorption spec -
trum would reveal that all peaks de -
creased approximately in  proportion to each other. If dye removal is 
 attributed to biodegradation, either 
the major visible light absorbance 
peak would completely disappear or 
a new peak would appear. Dye ad -
sorption would result in cell mats, 
which are deeply coloured because 
of adsorbed dyes, whereas those 
retaining their original colours are 
accompanied by the occurrence of  
biodegradation.
Conclusion
In this study, a decolourizing bacterial 
strain, Pseudomonas spp. , was isolat -
ed from dye-contaminated soil. Pseu -
domonas spp. showed decolourizing 
activity through a degradation mech -
anism rather than adsorption, and it 
could tolerate high concentrations 
(up to 500 mg–1) of MO. With high 
degradative and decolourizing activ -
ity against various reactive dyes com -
monly used in the textile industries, 
it is proposed that Pseudomonas spp.  
has practical application potential in 
the  biotransformation of various dye 
effluents. The effects of oxygen, pH, 
temperatures and dye concentration 
on the decolourization of MO were in -
vestigated. Examination of the mech -
anism of the decolourization process 
indicated that it proceeded primarily
