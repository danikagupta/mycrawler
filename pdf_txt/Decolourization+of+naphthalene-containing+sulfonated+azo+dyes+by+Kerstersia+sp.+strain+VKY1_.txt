A facultative Staphylococcus arlettae bacterium, isolated from an activated sludge process in a textile 
industry, was able to successfully decolourize four different azo dyes under microaerophilic conditions 
(decolourization percentage >97%). Further aeration of the decolourized efﬂuent was performed to 
promote oxidation of the degradation products. The degradation products were characterized by FT-IR 
and UV–vis techniques and their toxicity with respect to Daphnia magna was measured. The amine 
concentrations as well as the total organic carbon (TOC) levels were monitored during the biodegra- 
dation process. The presence of aromatic amine in the microaerophilic stage and its absence in the 
aerobic stage indicated the presence of azoreductase activity and an oxidative biodegradation process, 
respectively. TOC reduction was w15% in the microaerophilic stage and w70% in the aerobic stage. The 
results provided evidence that, using a single Staphylococcus arlettae strain in the same bioreactor, the 
sequential microaerophilic/aerobic stages were able to form aromatic amines by reductive break-down of 
the azo bond and to oxidize them into non-toxic metabolites.

1. Introduction 
Azo dyes, which are aromatic compounds with one or more 
(–N ]N–) groups, are the most important and largest class of 
synthetic dyes used in commercial applications ( Vandevivere et al., 
1998 ). They are considered as xenobiotic compounds that are very 
recalcitrant to biodegradation processes ( Zollinger, 1991; Stolz, 
2001 ). The textile industry accounts for two-thirds of the total 
dyestuff market. During the dyeing process, approximately 10–15% 
of the dyes used are released into the wastewater. The presences of 
these dyes in the aqueous ecosystem are the cause of serious 
environmental and health concerns ( Fang et al., 2004; Asad et al., 
2007 ). Several methods are used to treat textile efﬂuents to achieve 
decolourization. These include physicochemical methods such as 
ﬁltration, coagulation, carbon activated and chemical ﬂocculation 
(Gogate and Pandit, 2004a, b ). These methods are effective but they 
are expensive and involve the formation of a concentrated sludge 
that creates a secondary disposal problem ( Maier et al., 2004 ). In 
recent years, new biological processes, including aerobic and 
anaerobic bacteria and fungi, for dye degradation and wastewater 
reutilization have been developed. The most widely researched fungi in regard to dye degradation 
are the ligninolytic fungi ( Bumpus, 2004 ). White-rot fungi in 
particular produce lignin peroxidase, manganese-peroxidase and 
laccase that degrade many aromatic compounds due to their non- 
speciﬁc enzyme systems ( Stolz, 2001; Robinson et al., 2001; 
McMullan et al., 2001; Wesenberg et al., 2003; Forgacs et al., 2004; 
Harazono and Nakamura, 2005; Pazarlioglu et al., 2005; Toh et al., 
2003; Mohorcic et al., 2006; Madhavi et al., 2007 ). Large literature 
exists regarding the potential of these fungi to oxidize phenolic, non- 
phenolic, soluble and non-soluble dyes ( Field et al., 1993; Pasti- 
Grigsby et al., 1992; Bumpus, 1995; Conneely et al., 1999; Kapdan 
et al., 2000; Borchert and Libra, 2001; Tekere et al., 2001; Kapdan 
and Kargi, 2002; Martins et al., 2002; Libra et al., 2003 ). Laccase 
preparations obtained from Pleurotus ostreatus ,Schizophyllum 
commune ,Sclerotium rolfsii and Neurospora crassa , increased up to 
25% the decolourization of individual commercial triarylmethane, 
anthraquinonic, and indigoid textile dyes ( Abadulla et al., 2000 ). In 
contrast, manganese peroxidase was reported as the main enzyme 
involved in dye decolourization by Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
(Chagas and Durrant, 2001 ) and lignin peroxidase for Bjerkandera 
adusta (Robinson et al., 2001 ). Some non-white-rot fungi that can 
successfully decolourize dyes have also been reported ( Kim and 
Shoda, 1999; Cha et al., 2001; Ambro ´sio and Campos-Takaki, 2004; 
Bumpus, 2004; Tetsch et al., 2005 ). However, the long growth cycle *Corresponding author. Tel.: þ55 19 3521 2173; fax: þ55 19 35212153.

variable in composition, limit the performance of these fungi. 
Although stable operation of continuous fungal bioreactors for the 
treatment of synthetic dye solutions has been achieved, application 
of white-rot fungi for the removal of dyes from textile wastewaters 
faces many problems such as large volumes produced, the nature of 
synthetic dyes, and control of biomass ( Palma et al., 1999; Nigam 
et al., 2000; Zhang and Yu, 2000; Robinson et al., 2001; Mielgo et al., 
2001; Stolz, 2001 ). In contrast, the bacterial reduction of the azo 
bond is usually nonspeciﬁc and bacterial decolourization is normally 
faster. Microbial decolourization and degradation has appeared as an 
environmentally friendly and cost-competitive alternative to 
chemical decomposition processes ( Verma and Madamwar, 2003; 
Moosvi et al., 2005; Pandey et al., 2007; Whiteley, 2007; Khalid et al., 
2008; Dhanve et al., 2008; Ozdemir et al., 2008 ). Research on 
bacterial strains that are able to decolourize azo dyes under aerobic 
(Xenphylus azovorans KF46F, Bacillus strain, Kerstersia sp. strain VKY1 
and Staphylococcus sp.) and anaerobic conditions ( Sphingomonas 
xenophaga BN6, Eubacterium sp., Clostridium sp., Butyrvibrio sp. or 
Bacteroides sp.) have been extensively reported ( Raﬁi et al., 1990; 
Kudlich et al.,1997; Suzuki et al., 2001; Blumel et al., 2002; Olukanni 
et al., 2006; Dos Santos et al., 2007; Vijaykumar et al., 2007; Hsueh 
and Chen, 2008; Lin and Leu, 2008 ). Based on the available literature, 
it can be concluded that the microbial decolourization of azo dyes is 
more effective under anaerobic conditions. On the other hand, these 
conditions lead to aromatic amine formation, and these are muta- 
genic and toxic to humans ( Chung and Stevens,1993; Do et al., 2002; 
Pinheiro et al., 2004 ) requiring a subsequent oxidative (aerobic) 
stage for their degradation. In this context, the combined anaerobic/ 
aerobic biological treatments of textile dye efﬂuents using microbial 
consortia are common in the literature ( Chang and Lin, 2000 ; Van 
der Zee and Villaverde, 2005; Lodato et al., 2007 ). However, few 
commercial or industrial applications have been developed using 
a single adaptable microorganism in a sequential anaerobic/aerobic 
treatment ( Isik and Sponza, 2003; Isik and Sponza, 2004; Supaka 
et al., 2004 ). Moreover, the available literature on the sequential 
microaerophilic/aerobic treatment with a single microorganism is 
extremely limited ( Sandhya et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2007 ). Apparently 
there is a need to develop novel biological decolourization processes 
leading to the more effective clean up of azo dyes using a single 
microorganism that is efﬁcient under both anaerobic/micro- 
aerophilic and aerobic conditions. Thus the main objective of this 
study was to observe the degradation of four azo dyes in a successive 
microaerophilic/aerobic process using exclusively a facultative 
anaerobic Staphylococcus arlettae bacterium isolated from textile dye 
efﬂuents. Dye degradation was performed under microaerophilic 
conditions until no residual colour was observed. The medium was 
subsequently aerated by stirring to promote oxidation of the 
aromatic amines formed by the reductive break-down of the azo 
bond into non-toxic metabolites. The effects of sodium pyruvate and 
yeast extract as carbon sources on the decolourization were also 
investigated, since it has been reported that the type of carbon 
source could affect dye decolourization and its subsequent reduction 
(Nigam et al., 1996; Bra ´s et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2008 ). The amine 
concentrations and TOC were monitored during the biodegradation 
process. The degradation products were also characterized using 
FT-IR and UV–vis techniques, and their toxicity measured. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Chemicals and media 
The azo dyes (100 mg L /C01) CI Reactive Yellow 107 (RY107, 
0.18 mM), CI Reactive Black 5 (RB5, 0.11 mM), CI Reactive Red 198 
(RR198, 0.13 mM) and CI Direct Blue 71 (DB71, 0.1 mM) were kindly provided by the Vicunha Textile Company, Itatiba, Brazil. The 
structures of the dyes are shown in Fig. 1 . All other analytical grade 
reagents were purchased from Sigma and used without further 
puriﬁcation. The mineral salts medium (MM) at pH 7 used in all the 
batch experiments contained: K 2HPO 4(1.6 g L /C01), KH 2PO 4(0.2 g 
L/C01), (NH 4)2SO 4(1.0 g L /C01), MgSO 4$7H 2O (0.2 g L /C01), FeSO 4$7H 2O
(0.01 g L /C01), NaCl (0.1 g L /C01), CaCl 2$2H 2O (0.02 g L /C01). The rich 
mineral medium (MMR) consisted of MM supplemented with 
100 mg L /C01of each dye, 3 g L /C01of glucose and 1 g L /C01of yeast 
extract and was autoclaved at 121 /C14C for 15 min. 
2.2. Strain isolation and characterization 
The microorganisms were isolated from different stages of the 
activated sludge produced by the Vicunha Textile Company, Itatiba, 
Brazil. Serial dilutions (10 /C01–10 /C06) of the samples collected were 
inoculated into nutrient agar medium by the spread plate tech- 
nique. Isolated strains were inoculated into MM with a low glucose 
concentration (0.1 g L /C01) and mixed with azo dyes (100 mg L /C01per 
dye) and incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 30 /C14C for 
7 days. The strain that achieved the best decolourization was 
selected for this study. 
Identiﬁcation of the isolated strain was performed by 16S rDNA 
sequence analysis. Genomic DNA was obtained according to Pitcher 
et al. (1989) . The 16SrRNA gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using the 
speciﬁc primers, 27f and 1401r for the universal bacteria domain 
(Lane, 1991 ). 
Fifty-microlitre reaction mixtures were prepared containing 
100 ng of total DNA, 2 U of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen /C210), 0.2 mM of 
deoxynucleoside triphosphates and 0.4 mM of each primer. The PCR 
ampliﬁcations were done using an initial denaturation step of 
2 min at 94 /C14C, followed by 10 cycles of 1 min each at 94 /C14C, 30 s at 
69 /C14C, decreasing 0.5 /C14C each cycle, and 3 min at 72 /C14C, followed by 
another 10 cycles of 1 min each at 94 /C14C, 30 s at 63 /C14C and 3 min at 
72 /C14C, in an Eppendorf thermal cycler. 
The PCR product was puriﬁed on GFX /C212PCR DNA and a Gel Band 
Puriﬁcation kit (GE HealthCare) for automated sequencing in the 
MegaBace DNA Analysis System 1000. The sequencing was carried 
out using the 10f (5 0GAG TTT GAT CCT GGC TCA G3 0); 765f (5 0ATT 
AGA TAC CCT GGT AG3 0); 782r (5 0ACC AGG GTA TCT AAT CCT GT3 0)
and 1100r (5 0AGG GTT GGG GTG GTT G 3 0) primers and the DYE- 
namic ET Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit for the automated 
MegaBace 500 system (GE Healthcare), according to the manu- 
facturer’s instructions. 
Partial 16S rRNA sequences obtained from isolates were 
assembled in a contig using the phred/Phrap/CONSED program 
(Godon et al., 1997; Ewing et al., 1998 ). Identiﬁcation was achieved 
by comparing the contiguous 16S rRNA sequences obtained with 
the 16S rRNA sequence data from the reference and type strains 
available in the public databases GenBank and RDP (Ribosomal 
Database Project, Wisconsin, USA) using the BLASTn and RDP 
sequence match routines, respectively. The sequences were aligned 
using the CLUSTAL X program and analyzed with the MEGA soft- 
ware 2001 ( Thompson et al., 1994; Kumar et al., 2004 ). Evolu- 
tionary distances were derived from sequence-pair dissimilarities, 
calculated as implemented in MEGA, using Kimura’s DNA substi- 
tution model ( Kimura, 1980 ). 
The phylogenetic reconstruction was done using the neighbour- 
joining (NJ) algorithm, with bootstrap values calculated from 1000 
replicate runs, using the routines included in the MEGA software 
(Saitou and Nei, 1987 ). 
2.3. Aromatic amine detection 
The aromatic amines in the solid phase were determined by the 
modiﬁed Marik and Lam method (2003) . Samples were taken after F. Elisangela et al. / International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation 63 (2009) 280–288 281 incubation under the microaerophilic and aerobic conditions, 
frozen and freeze-dried (FTS system model Dura-Dry MP). The 
samples (5 mg) were dissolved in 5 mL of a 0.4% solution of chlor- 
anil in dimethylformamide (DMF) and heated to 100 /C14C for 5 min. 
The absorption was determined in a UV–vis Helios aUnicam spec- 
trophotometer at 560 nm. A calibration curve was prepared using 
aniline-2-sulfonic acid as a model product of the reduction of azo 
dyes, and the sample amine concentration was calculated in 
millimoles L /C01. The control was the MMR medium without the dye, 
treated with the bacterium under microaerophilic and aerobic 
conditions. 
2.4. Dye decolourization 
Decolourization assays were carried out under static conditions 
with 350 mL cultures of MMR (pH 7) supplemented with 100 mg 
L/C01of the dyes. The samples were incubated under microaerophilic 
conditions at 30 /C14C for 168 h or until no colour was observed. 
Further aeration was carried out in a shaker at 150 rpm to promote 
oxidation of the degradation products. Dye decolourization was 
measured in a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 2101) for the microaerophilic and aerobic stages, and the percentage of 
efﬂuent decolourization was calculated. 
2.5. UV–vis analysis 
The dye degradation products produced during biodegradation 
under microaerophilic and aerobic conditions were studied by 
following the change in the UV–vis spectra (from 200 to 800 nm) 
using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453). 
2.6. Infrared spectrum analysis 
The controls and samples were dried and mixed with KBr (1:20; 
0.02 g of sample with KBr at a ﬁnal weight of 0.4 g). The samples 
were then ground, desorbed at 60 /C14C for 24 h and pressed to obtain 
IR-transparent pellets. The absorbance FT-IR spectra of the samples 
were recorded using an FT-IR Spectrum 2000 Perkin–Elmer spec- 
trometer. The spectra were collected within a scanning range of 
400–4000 cm /C01. The FT-IR was ﬁrst calibrated for background 
signal scanning with a control sample of pure KBr, and then the 
experimental sample was scanned. The FT-IR spectrum of the N N SO 3Na

and degraded dyes. 
2.7. TOC measurement 
The presence of organic carbon in the samples containing dyes 
was monitored by measuring the total organic carbon (TOC) under 
microaerophilic conditions and after agitation, using a TOC 
analyzer (Shimadzu 5000A) with automatic injection of the 
samples (500–2000 mL) ( Shimadzu Corporation, 1997 ). Samples 
were centrifuged (20,000 /C2gfor 15 min) and ﬁltered through 
a 0.45- mm pore size ﬁlter. The TOC measurement is based on the 
combustion of the total carbon (TC) on a sample ﬁlled tube with 
a catalyst and heated to 680 /C14C. The standard deviation is less than 
2% for full scale ranging from 2000 ppm to 4000 ppm. All the 
samples were analysed using a ﬁve-point calibration curve. 
2.8. Toxicity test 
After treatment with Staphylococcus arlettae , the samples were 
centrifuged at 20,000 /C2gfor 20 min and ﬁltered through a 0.45- mm
pore size ﬁlter. The acute toxicity tests with Daphnia magna 
(Crustacea, Cladocera) were carried out according to the ABNT NBR 
12713 methodology (1993) . The sensitivity tests were carried out 
with neonates (6–24 h old). For each sample concentration (1, 25, 
50, 75, 100%), 5 organisms were used in a 5 mL ﬂask. The tests 
under the microaerophilic and aerobic conditions and the control 
in water were carried out in triplicate for each concentration. The 
ﬂasks containing the samples were maintained at 20 /C14C for 48 h in 
the absence of light. The number of immobile organisms was then 
counted after 20 s of light exposure. 
3. Results 
3.1. Strain isolation and identiﬁcation 
The Staphylococcus arlettae strain VN-11 is a gram positive 
coccus, non-motile and facultative anaerobic bacterium. Hetero- 
trophic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus sp., are usually dominant in 
the activated sludge system, degrading and eventually mineralizing 
organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water ( Sidat et al., 1999; 
Ajibola et al., 2005; Olukanni et al., 2006 ).The VN-11 strain was 
isolated from raw efﬂuents from a textile industry in Campinas, 
Brazil, and selected based on its ability to discolour a mixture of 
four azo dyes (100 mg L /C01each) in a study in MM supplemented 
with a low glucose concentration (0.1 g L /C01). The 16S rRNA gene 
sequence of the VN-11 strain was determined and compared with available 16S rRNA gene sequences from organisms in the GenBank 
and RDP databases. The VN-11 strain was phylogenetically posi- 
tioned in the genus Staphylococcus . The nucleotide alignment of the 
strain VN-11 supported bootstrap values of 99% similarity to 
Staphylococcus arlettae and other strains including the sequence of 
the strain types S. gallinarum ATCC 35539 T,S. cohnii , ATCC 29974 T
(D83361). The evolutive distance was based on the Kimura 2p 
model ( Kimura, 1980 ). The GenBank accession numbers are rep- 
resented in parentheses. Sulfobacillus acidophilus DSM 10332 Twas 
used as the outgroup. The phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 2 ) showed the 
grouping of VN-11 within Staphylococcus arlettae , conﬁrming its 
identiﬁcation due to the high bootstrap value. 
3.2. Decolourization 
The strain Staphylococcus arlettae was tested to separately 
decolourize fourazo dyes (CI Reactive Yellow 107, CI Reactive Red 198, 
CI Reactive Black 5 and CI Direct Blue 71) in a microaerophilic/aerated 
sequential process. Complete decolourization ( >97%, Table 1 ) of the 
azo dyes was achieved in the microaerophilic stage, even if the 
bacteria showed little growth (data not shown), and no signiﬁcant 
changes were detected in the following aerobic stage. Staphylococcus 
arlettae could only decolourize thedyes effectively when themedium 
was supplemented with yeast extract. The decolourization time 
showed a relationship with the chemical structure of the dyes. The 
monoazo RY107 and RR198 were decolourized in 12 and 10 h, 
respectively. The diazo RB5 and the triazo DB71 were decolourized 
after 24 and 48 h, respectively (Table1). 
3.3. Aromatic amine determination 
All the decolourized dye media showed the presence of 
aromatic amines after the microaerophilic stage, with the exception 
of DB71. In this latter case the measurement could not be carried 
out, due to interference by the chemical structure of this dye with 
the methodology used ( Table 1 ). The monoazos RY107 and RR198 
showed amine concentrations of0.21 and 0.13 mM, respectively. 
The diazo RB5 showed the highest amine concentration (0.28 mM). 
After the aerobic stage a signiﬁcant reduction in the amine 
concentrations was observed ( Table 1 ). The mass balance of the azo 
dyes (%), with the exception of DB71, was estimated from the amine 
concentrations after the microaerophilic dye degradation, 
assuming that that 1 mole of RY107 and RR198 should produce 
2 moles of amines and that 1 mole of RB5 should produce 3 moles 
of amines ( Nam and Tratnyek, 2000 ). The monoazo RY107 and 
RR198 achieved a 58% and 100% of mass balance, respectively. The

achieved only a 40% of mass balance. 
3.4. UV–vis characterization 
The biodegradation of the four azo dyes was monitored by UV– 
vis analysis. For untreated dyes, as shown in Fig. 3 a, RY107 pre- 
sented two absorbance peaks at 301 and 550 nm. As shown in 
Fig. 3 b, RR198 presented absorbance peaks at 513, 380, 290 and 
220 nm and a shoulder at 325 nm. Fig. 3 c shows that RB5 presented 
large peaks at 580 and 314 nm. Two additional peaks with low 
absorbance were observed at 220 and 390 nm. As shown in Fig. 3 d, 
DB71 presented one large peak at 412 nm and a smaller peak at 
300 nm. Wide band absorption near 220 nm was observed for all 
the dyes. For treated dyes, after biodegradation of the four azo dyes 
in the microaerophilic and aerobic treated solutions, the absor- 
bance peaks in the visible region disappeared, indicating complete 
decolourization. In the UV spectra, the peaks at 285 and 320 nm disappeared and were replaced by new peaks at 245 and 260 nm 
(Fig. 3 ). 
3.5. FT-IR characterization 
The FT-IR spectra obtained from the untreated dye samples 
showed several peaks in the region where N–H and O–H stretching 
is normally observed (3300–3500 cm /C01). After the microaerophilic 
and aerobic treatments a signiﬁcant reduction in absorption was 
observed in this region. Other bands located in the range from 
1610–1630 cm /C01and at 1402 cm /C01disappeared in the micro- 
aerophilic stage after reductive treatment. Moreover, in the 
microaerophilic stage two new bands were observed in the 
carbonyl region at around 1680–1600 cm /C01, attributed to amine 
groups. These two bands disappeared in the aerobic stage and 
a new peak around 1680 cm /C01was observed. In the aerated 
samples a new broad region between 2400 and 2500 cm /C01, asso- 
ciated with carboxylic acid and NH 3þions, and new peaks at 
850,950 cm /C01and 1140 cm /C01, were observed ( Fig. 4 ). 
3.6. Toxicity test and TOC reduction 
The results for Daphnia magna toxicity are presented as the 
percentage of death occurring in the solutions produced during the 
incubation of Staphylococcus arlettae under microaerophilic and 
aerobic conditions, as compared to the control composed of the dye 
solution and the culture medium without the bacterium. The tests 
were carried out in a 1:4 dilution of the original supernatant 
concentration, since 100% mortality occurred in the original and 1:2 
supernatant concentrations. The controls showed equal mortality 
for all the dyes (40–47%). Under microaerophilic conditions, 
mortality decreased for all the dyes and when the samples were Table 1

Conversely, a signiﬁcant increase in TOC reduction (up to 88%) was

4. Discussion 
Staphylococcus arlettae strain VN-11 is a gram positive coccus, 
non-motile and facultative anaerobic bacterium. Although this 
bacterium has shown greater dye degradation ability as compared 
to other bacteria, there is no available literature on dye decolouri- 
zation with Staphylococcus arlettae . Previous studies have shown 
that strains of Staphylococcus sp., isolated from soil in a textile- 
efﬂuent treatment plant, were able to decolourize the sulfonate azo 
dye Congo Red ( Park et al., 2005 ). Chen et al. (2005) isolated the 
gene encoding NADPH-ﬂavin azoreductase (Azo1) from the human 
skin bacterium Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, which 
conﬁrmed that the enzyme responsible for dye decolourization 
could be an inducible ﬂavoprotein using both NADH and NADPH as 
electron donors, as previously reported for other bacterial strains 
(Moutaouakkil et al., 2003 ). Azoreductase is the key enzyme 
responsible for the reductive azo dye degradation in bacterial 
species. The presence of oxygen normally inhibits the azo bond 
reduction activity, since aerobic respiration may dominate use of 
the NADH, thus impeding electron transfer from NADH to the azo 
bonds ( Chang and Lin, 2001 ). The advantage of the anaerobic 
reduction of azo dyes is that oxygen depletion is easily accom- 
plished in microaerophilic cultures thus enabling anaerobic, 
facultative anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria to reduce azo 
dyes. The reaction takes place at neutral pH values and is extremely 
unspeciﬁc ( Stolz, 2001 ). However, the precise mechanism of anaerobic azoreduction is still not totally understood. It was 
recently suggested that microbial anaerobic azoreduction was 
linked to the electron transport chain, and that dissimilatory 
azoreduction was a form of microbial anaerobic respiration ( Hong 
et al., 2007 ). In addition, different models for the nonspeciﬁc 
reduction of azo dyes by bacteria, which do not require transport of 
the azo dyes or reduced ﬂavins through the cell membrane, or that 
describe the extracellular reduction of azo dyes by anaerobic 
bacteria, were recently suggested ( Maier et al., 2004 ). These results 
suggested that azo dye reduction was a strain-speciﬁc mechanism 
that could be performed by an azoreductase enzyme or by a more 
complex metabolic pathway. Thus, due to the lack of information 
about the metabolism of Staphylococcus arlettae the usual true time 
dependant kinetic determinations of the azoreductase activity 
using the azo dye as substrate were not performed, and the azo 
reduction mechanism in Staphylococcus arlettae will be the subject 
of a future speciﬁc study. 
In the present work, the strain Staphylococcus arlettae was tested 
to separately decolourize four azo dyes (RY107, RR198, RB5 and 
DB71) in a sequential microaerophilic/aerated process in the pres- 
ence of yeast extract as the source of the electron donors NAD and 
NADH. In the absence of yeast extract, a partial decolourization 
(<50%) was achieved after 168 h for RY107 and RR198, but there was 
no decolourization for any of the dyes when the yeast extract and 
glucose were substituted by sodium pyruvate (data not shown). It is 
known that the decolourization rate of azo dyes is increased by using 
redox mediators such as the water-soluble ﬂavins (FADH 2, FMNH 2), 
NADH or NADPH, which speed up the reaction rate by shuttling 
electrons from the biological oxidation of primary electron donors or 
from bulk electron donors to the electron-accepting azo dyes ( Dos 
Santos et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2001a; Chung and Stevens, 1993; 
Gingell and Walker,1971 ). Thus Staphylococcus arlettae indicated the 
obligatory requirement of yeast extract as a redox mediator to attain 
efﬁcient dye decolourization. Yeast extract, a powder supplement 
consisting of protein, free amino nitrogen, B vitamins, minerals, 
nucleotides and other yeast cell components, has been the most 
commonly used nitrogen source for dye decolourization processes 
(Robert et al., 1998 ). Many pure cultures like Pseudomonas luteola ,
Klebsiella pneumoniae and Aeromonas hydrophila have exhibited 
effective decolourization of different dyes in the presence of yeast 
extract ( Hu, 1998; Chang et al., 2001b; Wong and Yuen, 1996; Chen 
et al., 2003; Khehra et al., 2005 ). Moreover, a recent study showed 
that a combination of the variables including glucose and yeast 
extract resulted in more than 90% decolourization of the azo dye 
Direct Black 22 ( Mohana et al., 2008 ). 
The chemical structures of the dyes greatly inﬂuence their 
decolourization rates, and the decolourization efﬁciency is limited 
to several azo dye structures ( Chivukula and Renganathan, 1995 ). 
Dyes with simple structures and low molecular weights usually 
exhibit higher rates of colour removal, whereas colour removal is 
more difﬁcult with highly substituted, high molecular weight dyes 
(Chen et al., 2003; Pearce et al., 2003 ). For this reason, RY107 and 
RR198, which are both monoazo, showed a short decolourization 
time (12 and 10 h, respectively) and the highly substituted diazo 
RB5 and the triazo DB71 showed longer decolourization times (24 
and 48 h, respectively) (Table1). It has been reported that the 
turnover rate of monoazo dyes increased with increasing dye 
concentration, whereas the turnover rate of the diazo and triazo 
dyes remained constant as the dye concentration increased ( Hu, 
2001 ). Moreover, the azo compounds with a hydroxyl or amino 
groups were more likely to be degraded than those with methyl, 
methoxy, sulfo or nitro groups ( Nigam et al., 1996 ). Usually, the 
presence of sulfonates in reactive dye structures results in low 
levels of colour removal. However, this is not applicable to direct 
dyes (DB71) that usually exhibit high levels of colour removal 
independent of the number of sulfonate groups in the dye

of azo bonds are responsible for the different decolourization times 
(Hitz et al., 1978 ). It has also been reported that a correlation 
between the enzyme redox potential and its activity towards the 
substrates could inﬂuence the decolourization rate ( Call and 
Mucke, 1997; Xu et al., 1996 ). In this context, the decolourization 
times obtained in the present work were in agreement with those 
of Zille et al. (2004) , who found a linear relationship between the 
cathodic peak potentials and the time of maximum decolourization 
for several azo dyes using an ascomycete yeast Issatchenkia occi- 
dentalis . Thus the ability of the bio-agents to degrade azo dyes 
depends on the structural characteristics of the dye, the tempera- 
ture and the pH of the medium, the presence of intermediates and 
the difference between the redox potentials of the biocatalyst and 
the dye. Further studies will be carried out to measure the redox 
potential of the dyes by cyclic voltametry in order to verify this 
correlation. 
The biodegradation of the azo dyes was also monitored by UV– 
vis and FT-IR analyses ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). Although the presence of the 
typical absorption peak of the hydrogenated azo bond structure 
(Ar dNH dNH dAr 0) at 245 nm in the spectra seems to indicate only 
partial azo bond disruption after biodegradation of the four azo 
dyes in the microaerophilic and aerobic treated solutions, the 
absorbance peaks in the visible region disappeared indicating 
complete decolourization ( Qing, 1989 ). The presence of high 
concentrations of aromatic amines in the microaerophilic stage 
conﬁrmed this statement ( Table 1 ). In the UV spectra, the decrease 
in absorbance of the peaks at 220 and 320 nm corresponding, 
respectively, to the benzene and naphthalene rings ( Yang, 1987; 
Mielgo et al., 2001 ), and the formation of a new peak at 260 nm, 
suggested that the reductive destruction of the azo conjugated 
structure disclosed the narrow multi-peaks of aromatic rings in the 
spectra ( Feng et al., 2000 ). In the FT-IR analysis, interference by the 
yeast extract added to the medium restricted data interpretation, 
showing very similar spectra. However, some conclusions were 
attained, and the dye (RR198), used as a model substrate, is shown 
in Fig. 4 . The bands located within the range 1610–1630 cm /C01and 
at 1402 cm /C01were due to azo linkages –N ]N– on aromatic 
structures and of –N ]N– stretching in a-substituted compounds, 
respectively ( Parikh, 1974 ). These peaks decreased during the 
treatment and in some cases disappeared completely in the spec- 
trum of the microaerophilic and aerobic treated dyes, conﬁrming 
the previous UV–vis results about azo linkage disruption ( Coates, 
2000 ). In the microaerophilic stage, the reduction of the azo linkage 
peak was followed by the formation of two bands in the carbonyl 
region at around 1680–1600 cm /C01. Two bands in this region were 
consistent with an amide derived from ammonia or a primary 
amine. In the aerobic stage these two bands disappeared and a new 
peak around 1680 cm /C01was observed. The presence of this addi- 
tional group, due to the conjugation of C ]C and C ]O groups, 
suggested that this peak could belong to a carbonyl group in 
a carboxylic acid, ketone, ester or conjugated aldehyde group 
attached to an aromatic ring ( Gavril and Hodson, 2007 ). The fact 
that no new peaks appeared between 3300–3500 cm /C01(attributed 
to azo bonds and OH groups in position arelative to the azo 
linkage) and in the region between 1340 and 1250 cm /C01(–NH 2)
after the aerobic treatment, suggested that the azo linkage could be 
transformed into N 2or NH 3or incorporated into the biomass 
(Spadaro and Renganathan, 1994; Goszczynski et al., 1994; Shaw 
and Freeman, 2004 ). Moreover, the presence of a new broad region 
between 2400 and 2500 cm /C01in the aerobically treated samples, 
could indicate the presence of carboxylic acid and NH 3þions 
(symmetric stretching mode), suggesting partial mineralization. 
Also the presence of new peaks at 850 and 950 cm /C01(associated 
with the out-of-plane bending vibration of substituted benzenes) 
and the peak at 1140 cm /C01that could belong to acetate, formates, propionates, benzoates, etc., suggested that the products were 
undergoing irreversible chemical changes, probably due to 
concomitant biodegradation and autoxidation reactions of the 
products formed during the reductive dye degradation ( Skoog et al., 
1998 ). A large fraction of the aromatic amines from azo dyes are 
susceptible to autoxidation, producing water-soluble, highly col- 
oured dimers, oligomers and eventually dark-coloured polymers 
with low solubility ( Kudlich et al., 1999 ). Remarkably, in contrast to 
the expectation that bio-recalcitrant aromatic amines would tend 
to autoxidise forming coloured products, in the present experiment 
no increase in colour in the visible region was observed in the 
aerobic stage, suggesting that the aromatic amines were effectively 
biodegraded. However, although in some cases biodegradation of 
the dye’s cleavage products was demonstrated ( Coughlin et al., 
2003 ), it is difﬁcult to predict the fate of the aromatic amines during 
the anaerobic/aerobic treatment of azo dyes, because it is not clear 
whether their removal was due to biodegradation, adsorption or 
chemical reactions ( Van Der Zee and Villaverde, 2005 ). The toxicity 
results for the controls (40–47%), shown in Table 2 , are in agree- 
ment with the ﬁndings reported by Hunger and Jung (1991) that 
the reactive dyes and hydrolyzed reactive dyes had a low toxic 
potential towards aquatic organisms as compared to the basic, acid 
and dispersed dye. 
The Daphnia magna toxicity test demonstrated that the degra- 
dation under microaerophilic conditions was not sufﬁcient to 
remove the toxicity of the samples ( w30%). Therefore, oxidation of 
the aromatic amines, as conﬁrmed by the absence of amines in the 
aerobic stage ( Table 1 ) was necessary to diminish the toxicity in the 
medium. As shown in Table 2 , when the medium was incubated 
under microaerophilic conditions, the reduction in TOC was only 
w15%, even after 7 days of incubation. Conversely, a signiﬁcant 
increase in TOC reduction ( w70%) was observed in the aerobic 
stage. It was concluded that even if the microorganisms were able 
to decolourize the dyes under microaerophilic conditions, the 
aerobic microorganisms needed aeration not only for amine 
removal but also for TOC stabilization ( Sponza and Isik, 2005 ). 
5. Conclusions 
The strain VN-11 isolated from the dye efﬂuent was identiﬁed by 
16S rDNA as Staphylococcus arlettae . All the dyes tested were totally 
and rapidly decolourized under microaerophilic conditions, with 
some differences in decolourization times depending on the dye 
structure, as conﬁrmed by the UV–vis analysis. Decolourization was 
strongly dependent on the presence of yeast extract in the medium, 
indicating the need for additional vitamin and nitrogen sources. 
The formation of amines in the microaerophilic stage and their 
disappearance in the aerobic stage was conﬁrmed by the direct 
measurement and by FT-IR analysis. In the aerobic stage the partial 
mineralization of the dye degradation products and of the medium 
metabolites, was conﬁrmed by the FT-IR, toxicity and TOC 
measurements. Moreover, high decolourization efﬁciency was 
attained in the presence of only slight growth of the bacterium, 
which would result in very low amounts of sludge formation, thus 
avoiding high disposal costs. This methodology using a single 
microorganism in a sequential microaerophilic/aerobic process was 
shown to be very effective in azo dye decolourization. In a single 
reactor with a single bacterium, only changing the agitation 
conditions, it was possible not only to decolourize the dyes, but also 
to achieve a good degree of mineralization and low toxicity, with 
low running and maintenance costs.
