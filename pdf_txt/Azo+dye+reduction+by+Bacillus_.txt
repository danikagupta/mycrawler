Abstract  
Azo dyes are widely used colourants owing to their , possess array of possible colours and are 
general ly recalcitran tce to microbial degradation  owing to their toxicity . This study aimed to 
isolate azo dyes degrading bacteria from soil; treat methyl red and crystal violet dyes using the 
isolates, and assess the phytotoxicity of the treated and untreated dyes on sorghum. Te n bacteria 
were isolated from the soil, of which two were identified as efficient azo dyes degrading 
bacteria by efficiency in dye decolouration. The isolates were identified as Escherichia coli  and 
Bacillus subtilis  based on their biochemical characterist ics. The isolates were able to degrade 
methyl orange dye by 16 -75 % and crystal violet by 16 -78%, depending on the concentration of 
the dye. The isolates were more efficient at degrading the dyes at a low concentration of 
0.00025 mg/ml, as indicated by a h igher percentage of decolourization (53 -79%). The 
percentage phytotoxicity of the untreated methyl red ranged from 33 -59%, while the toxicity of 
the untreated crystal violet ranged from 62 -91%. The toxicity of the treated methyl red ranged 
from 9 -34%, whil e the toxicity of the treated crystal violet ranged from 12 -32%.  The results 
revealed that the isolates were capable of degrading methyl red and crystal violet dyes, and 
could be useful in the bioremediation of azo dyes polluted soil.

Introduction  
Dyes are the coloured substances which fix firmly with the substrate. There are different types 
of dyes classified according to their structures and functions. Azo dyes  are the largest group of 
dyes used in the industry, representing more than half of the annual production [1,2] . Azo dyes 
are the largest class of synthetic dyes with t he greatest variety of colours [3] . Different varieties 
of azo dyes are in use today in the consumer goods industries because of the diversity of dye 
components available for the synthesis of a large number of structu rally different azo dyes [4,5] . 
Azo dyes are used by a wide number of industries because these compounds retain their colour 
and structural integrity under exposure to sunlight, soil, bacteria and sweat; they also exhibit 
high resistance to microbial degradation [6].  
There is a continual demand to develop longer -lasting, more applicable dyes for i tems such as 
synthetic fabrics [7 ,8]. Azo dyes are continually updated to produce colours that reflect the 
trends dictated by changing social ideas and styles. From an environmental standpoint, the 
expansion in the demand and application of azo dyes is a threat to the safety of life which  is 
never going away unless alternatives are found or better ways to manage them are devised.  
While most azo dyes themselves are non -toxic , a significantly larger po rtion of their metabolites 
are [6,9,10] . The potential for toxic effects of exposure to dyes and dye metabolites is not a new 
concern. Some dyes are carcinogenic and genotoxic because of the toxic pot ential of many 
aromatic amines [5,11] . Although several soil microorganisms can degrade dyes, the y are often 
limited by the production of toxic by -products or the presence of toxic dye additives and also 
high salt concentrations [12]. Thus, these dyes are likely to persist in the environment and 
become toxic to biota.  Comment [A1]: Recast, language and content

 The treatment of dye effluents is of interest due to their toxic and aesthetic impacts on receiving 
soil and water bodies. Effective and economic treatment of a diversity of effluents containing 
azo has become a problem. Currently, much research has been f ocused on chemically and 
physically degrading azo dyes in wastewaters, such as chemical oxidation, UV oxidation, 
electrochemical or wet oxidation, activated carbon adsorption, reverse osmosi s, or 
coagulation/flocculation [2,13,14] . Many of these technologi es are cost -prohibitive, however, 
and therefore are not viable options for treating large waste streams.  
While much research has been performed to develop effective treatment technologies, no single 
solution has been satisfactory for remediating the divers ity of wastes from dye industries [15] . 
This is because no single treatment system is adequate for degrading the diverse dye structures. 
However, the chemical structures of dyes can be modified by microbial metabolism  [16,17] .  
Dye substrates can serve as a source of carbon, energy and nitrogen for tolerant bacteria and 
fungi, as defined by their structural composition [3,18] . This makes the biodegradation of azo 
dyes a viable option for chemical and physical treatment, as it can bring about complete 
minera lization of the dye. Several species of species  have been reported to effectively 
decolourize azo dyes in a wide range of salt solution s [19 -21]. Microorganisms decolourize dyes 
by desulphonation of their aromatic moiety coupled with reductive cleavage of the azo bond to 
prohibit aromatic amine formation, thereby, d etoxifying the aromatic amines [20,22] . Also, the 
adsorption of the dye molecules to microbial cells has been implica ted in the decolourization of 
dyes [23] . Several factors could affect the degr adation of dyes by microorganisms, including 
factors related to the microorganisms themselves.  
The widely used phytotoxicity tests in vascular plants are the seed germination test (a direct 
exposure method) and the root elongation test [24,25] . Seed germi nation represents an important 
initial phase in the life cycle of plants . Any adverse effect on the seed germination process 
would be detrimental to the establishment and healthy growth of plants.  
This study aims to isolate azo dyes degrading bacteria fro m the soil and assess their ability to 
degrade methyl orange and basic violet dyes, as well as to assess the phytotoxicity of the dye on 
sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ) seeds . 
Materials and Methods  
Sample Collection  
The soil samples  were collected from a laboratory -scale textile mill and printing press at the 
University of Port Harcourt, Port Harcourt. These samples were collected at a depth of 10cm in 
10g amounts into a sterile Erlenmeyer flask.  
The dyes used are methyl orange (Aci d orange 52) with 85% purity and the dye crystal violet 
(Basic violet 3) with 95% purity (BDH Chemicals Ltd, England). Stock solutions of each dye 
were prepared by dissolving 0.1g of dye into 100 ml of the mineral salt medium.  
Isolation of Dye Degrading Ba cteria  
One gram of each dye was added into a 25ml mineral salt medium, followed by the addition of 
1g of soil sample. The flask was shaken properly and incubated in a shaker incubator 
(Barloworld Scientific Ltd, U.K) at 50rpm at 300C. The cultures were ob served daily for 
decolourization of the dye. After 14 days of incubation, 1ml of culture from each flask was 
serially diluted by Ten -fold serial dilution using physiological saline and spread plated onto 
mineral source agar medium in Petri dishes contained . Colonies which developed after Comment [A4]: Define the objectives,

Identification of Isolates  
Isolates were identified following Gram reaction, motility, and spore formation, and based on 
their biochemical profiles following citrate, oxidase, methyl red, Voges -Proskauer, indole, TSI 
(Triple Sugar Iron), starch hydrolysis, sugar fermentation test.  
Preparation of standard inoculum  
Isolates were picked from the stock culture and each was inoculated into 10ml sterile nutrient 
broth contained in test tubes. The cultures were incubated at 370C for 24 hours. These served as 
the standard inoculums for the various tests.  
Screening of Isolates for the Degradation of Methyl Orange and Crystal Violets  Dyes  
All bacterial isolates were screened for the ability to degrade methyl orange and crystal violet 
dyes in test tubes containing 20mls of stock solution. Isolates that were able to decolourize the 
dyes were considered as dye degrading bacteria.  
Degradation of Dye  
A loopful of each isolate from the standard inoculums was inoculated into 10ml of sterile 
nutrient broth in test tubes. Cultures were incubated at 370C for 24 hours. After incubation, 1ml 
from the culture was inoculated into 50ml of dye of different concentrations (0.00025mg/ml, 
0.0005mg/ml, 0.001mg/ml and 0.002 mg/ml) contained in 250ml Erlenmeyer flask and 
incubated at 370C. 
Degradation was monitored daily for four days as follows: Two millilitres were withdrawn from 
each flask star ting from day one and was centrifuged at 1000rpm for 30 minutes in an 800 
Electric Centrifuge (Xiangtian, China). The supernatant was decanted and analysed.  
The optical density was read using Spectrophotometer (EMCLAM, Germany) at 505nm for 
methyl orange and 588nm for crystal violet.

Phytotoxicity Assay  
Phytotoxicity was conducted a s per the me thod of Oyedeji and Immanuel [26]  with 
modifications. Ten viable sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ) seeds were pre -treated to prevent fungal 
growth by soaking them in sodium hypochlorite (3.5%w/v) solution for 8 minutes and 
subsequently rinsed ten times with sterile distilled water. Pre -treated seeds were placed on 
sterile Whatman No.1 filter pa pers in sterile Petri dishes. The Petri dishes were divided into 
three sets which consisted of set A (control experiment) which was irrigated with sterile distilled 
water; set B which was irrigated with untreated dye solution and set C which was irrigated with 
treated dye solution. The plates were irrigated daily with 5 ml of the dye solutions and were 
incubated at room temperature (25¬∫C). All experiments were carried out in triplicates. Seeds 
were considered to have germinated when root elongation was obser ved. The lengths of the 
radicles were recorded after 4 days. Toxic effect was measured in terms of percentage of 
phytotoxicity as:

Discussion  
Two azo dyes degrading bacteria were isolated from small -scale textile mill -contaminated 
soil. The isolates were identified as E. coli  and Bacillus subtilis . Both isolates decolourized 
the methyl blue and crystal violet dyes. Decolourization of  substrates is often associated with 
the degradation of the dye as decolourizing efficiency was dependent on the growth of the 
isolate in the flask  [11,20] . There was neither growth nor decolourization in the control 
flasks. This evidence that the decolour ization was due to the metabolic activity of the 
organisms and not due to any abiotic factors, in agreement with Oranusi and Ogugbue [20]. 
The dyes served as carbon, energy and nitrogen sources for the isolates as alluded to by 
Oran usi and Mbah [18] . 
 
Sever al bacterial species have been reported to degrade azo dyes including species of Proteus, 
Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas ,Actinobacillus, Mycobacterium, Bacillus  and E. coli [11,19,20] .

 earlier studies, on account of their  high metabolic diversity [20,27] . The efficiency of azo dye 
biodegradation by the two isolates can be influenced by factors such as the initial dye 
concentration, the presence of co -substrates, and the cu ltivation conditions such as pH, 
temperature, and oxygen availability. Therefore, cultural conditions must be optimized to 
increase the efficiency of dye degradation. Aromatic amines generated by the reductive 
cleavage of azo dyes are potentially tox ic, mu tagenic and carcinogenic [5,11] . The reduction 
in the toxicity of the dyes after treatment as the isolates utilized the dyes as a source of 
nitrogen might have detoxified the parent compounds or any intermediates formed as alluded 
to by Chivukula and Renga nathan [28]  and Abadulla et al. [29] . 
In the present study, the general effect of the two dyes on germination followed the same 
patterns. The percentage of phytotoxicity of both dyes increased with an increase in 
concentration. Although higher concentration s of the dye exert a phytotoxic effect ranging 
from 47 -93%, the lower concentration of the dye also exerted an adverse phytotoxic effect on 
the seed by 33 -64%. However, the treated dye exerted toxicity of 9 -22% at the lowest 
concentration of 0.00025 mg/ml and toxicity of 32 -56% at the highest concentration of 0.002 
mg/ml. This reemphasized that indiscriminate disposal of azo dye -containing waste into soil 
and water bodies poses a major threat to the environment.  
 
Conclusion  
The present study showed that mic robiological treatment of dyes is an efficient way to 
detoxify methyl red and crystal dyes. The toxic effect of dyes reported in this study suggests 
the need for remediation of textile dyes in the industry effluents before discharging them into 
the environ ment.Whatever treatment is adopted should ensure complete conversion of dye 
components to avoid the build -up of toxic metabolites.
