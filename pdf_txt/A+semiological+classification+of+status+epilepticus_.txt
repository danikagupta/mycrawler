  Copyright © 2020 Korean Neurological Association  1Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most serious neurologic emergencies. SE is a condition 
that encompasses a broad range of semiologic subtypes and heterogeneous etiologies. The 
treatment of SE primarily involves the management of the underlying etiology and the use of 
antiepileptic drug therapy to rapidly terminate seizure activities. The Drug Committee of the 
Korean Epilepsy Society performed a review of existing guidelines and literature with the aim 
of providing practical recommendations for antiepileptic drug therapy. This article is one of a 
series of review articles by the Drug Committee and it summarizes staged antiepileptic drug 
therapy for SE. While evidence of good quality supports the use of benzodiazepines as the 
first-line treatment of SE, such evidence informing the administration of second- or third-line 
treatments is lacking; hence, the recommendations presented herein concerning the treatment 
of established and refractory SE are based on case series and expert opinions. The choice of 
antiepileptic drugs in each stage should consider the characteristics and circumstances of each 
patient, as well as their estimated benefit and risk to them. In tandem with the antiepileptic 
drug therapy, careful searching for and treatment of the underlying etiology are required.

INTRODUCTION
Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most serious neurologic emergencies. SE is defined as 
“a condition resulting either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure 
termination or from the initiation of mechanisms which lead to abnormally prolonged 
seizures…that can have long-term consequences…including neuronal death, neuronal 
injury, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and duration of sei -
zures. ”1 This conceptual definition proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy 
(ILAE) Task Force on classification of status epilepticus also provides two operational 
time points: the onset of abnormally prolonged seizure (t 1) and the onset of the long-term 
consequences (t 2). These time points vary depending on the type of seizures.2 For convul -
sive SE (CSE), t 1 and t 2 are reportedly 5 and 30 min, respectively.1 Hence, the ideal treat -
ment of CSE should be completed within the window of 5 –30 min in order to prevent 
long-term consequences.
The heterogeneous classification of SE based on the age at onset, etiology, seizure semi -
ology, or electroclinical characteristics3-8 has informed the recent classification of SE pro -
posed by the ILAE Task Force based on the following four axes: semiology, etiology, elec -
troencephalography (EEG) correlates, and age.1 The foundation of the classification system, 
semiologic classification refers to the classification of the clinical presentation of SE accord -
ing to two main taxonomic criteria (Fig. 1): 1) the presence or absence of prominent mo -
tor symptoms and 2) the degree of consciousness impairment. SE with prominent motor Daeyoung Kima, Jae-Moon Kima

Antiepileptic Drug Therapy for Status Epilepticus JCNsymptoms and impaired consciousness can be classified as a 
CSE, also known as tonic–clonic SE. SE without prominent 
motor symptoms is summarized as nonconvulsive SE (NCSE).
It is noteworthy that the symptoms and signs of SE change 
dynamically over the course of SE–e.g., bilateral CSE fre -
quently evolve into a coma state with subtle, if any, convul -
sive movements. This condition is traditionally called subtle 
SE. If the patient presents to the hospital in this stage, the se -
miology of SE might be classified as NCSE with coma. Re -
garding the therapeutic approach to as well as proper classi -
fication of SE, however, it is more appropriate to classify SE 
according to the true initial semiology of seizures, which 
can only be presumed in some cases. If NCSE with coma is 
presumed to have evolved from CSE, it is recommended 
that the patient be treated for the latter.
The primary goal of the treatment of SE is to rapidly ter -
minate epileptic activity, ideally before t 2, in order to pre -
vent long-term consequences. SE, however, is not a single 
disease entity but rather a condition attributable to wide 
range of etiologies. Hence, the treatment of SE should en -
compass both antiepileptic drug therapy to terminate sei -
zures and treatments of the specific etiologies. The Drug 
Committee of the Korean Epilepsy Society performed a re -
view of the existing guidelines and literature with the aim of 
providing practical recommendations for antiepileptic drug 
therapy. As one report of the series of review articles pro -
duced by that committee, this article discusses the use of an -
tiepileptic drug therapy to stop epileptic activity. Although 
the etiology of SE and its treatment are beyond the scope of 
this article, the importance of ascertaining and treating the 
etiology of SE should not be overlooked at any point in the 
course of the treatment for SE.ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG THERAPY FOR 
CONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS
CSE can be divided into four stages: early, established, refrac -
tory, and super-refractory.9-12 It is recommended that this 
stage-based conception of CSE inform treatments of the con -
dition.13 Seizure activity that persists for more than 5 min is 
considered early SE, and first-line treatment should be ad -
ministered at this stage (Fig. 2). The failure of the first-line 
treatment or the persistence of seizure for more than 10 min 
indicates the presence of established SE as well as the need 
to initiate second-line treatment. Refractory SE indicates the 
failure of the second-line treatment with continuous seizure 
activity or recurrent seizures without the recovery of con -
sciousness. If SE continues or recurs 24 h or more after the 
anesthetic therapy, the patient’s condition is considered su -
per-refractory.
Early status epilepticus: first-line treatment
The first-line treatment for early SE mainly comprises the 
administration of benzodiazepines, the most frequently 
used of which include diazepam, lorazepam, and midazol -
am. Each of these drugs has been established as an effective 
first-line treatment for CSE based on randomized controlled 
trials.14-20
Diazepam
Diazepam is the first benzodiazepine used for the treatment 
of epilepsy and SE. Highly lipophilic and rapidly enters the 
brain, diazepam can be administered intravenously as a bo -
lus of 0.15 –0.2 mg/kg up to 10 mg.21-23 Considering the rela -
tively long elimination half-life of diazepam, its rapid redis -With prominent motor symptoms

Kim D et al.JCNtribution into peripheral tissues shortens its duration of action; 
repeated doses or an alternative longer-acting antiepileptic 
drug is usually required.
Lorazepam
Lorazepam can be administered intravenously. Although lo -
razepam has a longer onset of action relative to diazepam, it 
is less lipophilic and does not feature diazepam’s rapid redis -
tribution into peripheral tissues; consequently, it acts for a 
longer duration.24 This pharmacokinetic property favors its 
use in early SE. Four randomized controlled trials compared 
intravenous (IV) lorazepam and IV diazepam.14,15,17,20 One 
of these trials showed the superiority of lorazepam at 0.05 –
0.1 mg/kg in seizure control over diazepam at 0.3 –0.4 mg/
kg.15 While the other trials also appeared to favor lorazepam 
(4, 2, and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively) over diazepam (10, 5, and 
0.2 mg/kg, respectively), their findings were not statistically 
significant.14,17,20 A meta-analysis of three trials found that 
lorazepam performed significantly better in lowering the 
risk of noncessation of seizures compared with diazepam 
[risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 –0.90] 
and of continuation of SE requiring a different drug or gen -
eral anesthesia (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 –0.88).25 The recom -
mended dosage of IV lorazepam is 0.1 mg/kg, up to maxi -
mum of 4 mg, administered at 2 mg/min. The dosage may 
be repeated once.21-23,26Midazolam
Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine. At a physio -
logic pH, midazolam undergoes a conformational change to 
becomes lipophilic.27 Its water solubility allows midazolam to 
be administered via multiple routes, including by intramus -
cular (IM) injection. A randomized controlled trial com -
pared the efficacy of IM midazolam (10 mg for body weight 
>40 kg, 5 mg for body weight 13 –40 kg) as an out-of-hospi -
tal treatment with that of IV lorazepam (4 mg for body weight 
>40 kg, 2 mg for body weight 13 –40 kg) (Rapid Anticonvul -
sant Medication Prior to Arrival Trial).19 While these two 
drugs have similar safety, IM midazolam is shown to be supe -
rior to IV lorazepam in terms of seizure control. In the treat -
ment of CSE, IV or IM midazolam can be administered at a 
dose of 0.2 mg/kg up to 10 mg.21
Established status epilepticus: second-line  
treatment
Seizures continue and progress to established SE in about 
40% of patients with CSE despite benzodiazepine adminis -
tration as the first-line treatment. The second-line treatment for 
established SE consists of a loading dose of antiepileptic drugs. 
Frequently used antiepileptic drugs include phenytoin or fos -
phenytoin, valproate, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, and lacos -
amide. There is no clear evidence for the relative superiority of 
any of these drugs.22 A meta-analysis of the efficacy of second-
line drugs in terminating seizure activity showed that valpro -Fig. 2. Treatment options for convulsive status epilepticus at different stages. t 1: the onset of abnormally prolonged seizure, t 2: the onset of the

Antiepileptic Drug Therapy for Status Epilepticus JCNate exhibited the highest efficacy (75.7%; 95% CI 63.7 –84.8%), 
followed by phenobarbital (73.6%; 95% CI 58.3 –84.8%), leve -
tiracetam (68.5%; 95% CI 56.2 –78.7%), and phenytoin (50.2%; 
95% CI 34.2 –66.1%).28 Lacosamide was excluded from the 
meta-analysis due to insufficient data. Another recent meta-
analysis found that phenobarbital was superior to the others 
with respect to SE cessation, while lacosamide and valproate 
performed better in terms of tolerance.29 However, because 
the quality of evidence in these meta-analyses was insufficient, 
the results cannot be considered definitive. 
The recent randomized clinical trial Established Status Ep -
ilepticus Treatment Trial randomized patients aged >2 years 
to one of three pharmacotherapeutic regimens: 20 mg PE/kg 
fosphenytoin, 40 mg/kg valproate, and 60 mg/kg levetirace -
tam. While the sample size was originally designed to be 1,500 
patients, enrollment was discontinued after 400 patients (384 
unique patients) because the trial met the predefined criterion 
for futility of finding one drug to be superior or inferior.30,31 
The primary outcome of the cessation of SE and improvement 
in the level of consciousness at 60 min occurred in 68 patients 
assigned to levetiracetam (47%; 95% credible interval 39 –
55%), 53 assigned to fosphenytoin (45%; 95% credible inter -
val 36 –54%), and 56 assigned to valproate (46%; 95% credi -
ble interval 38 –55%). The incidence rates of adverse events 
were similar across the treatment arms. 
The lack of sufficient evidence for the second-line treat -
ment of established SE means that no single drug is recom -
mended over the others. Each drug has its own advantages 
and disadvantages depending on the clinical context. The 
choice of second-line drug relies largely on its availability and 
the systemic condition of the patient.
Phenobarbital
Phenobarbital primarily acts by enhancing γ-aminobutyric 
acid (GABA) inhibition. As one of the oldest drugs used to 
treat SE, the treatment efficacy of phenobarbital has been 
demonstrated for both early and established SE. In a ran -
domized controlled study that enrolled 384 patients with 
CSE, phenobarbital (15 mg/kg) was found to be as effective 
as lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg) as a first-line treatment.16 However, 
despite being effective in the treatment of established SE as 
well as early SE, the unfavorable safety profile of phenobarbi -
tal restricts its use–respiratory depression, hypotension, and 
sedation are commonly encountered adverse events, although 
serious systemic toxicities are rare. The IV loading dose of 
phenobarbital is 10 –20 mg/kg.21-23,26 The infusion rate should 
not exceed 100 mg/min in adults and 2 mg/kg/min in children.
Phenytoin and fosphenytoin
Phenytoin is one of the longest-standing antiepileptic drugs used in the treatment of SE. When delivered intravenously, 
phenytoin should be diluted in normal saline and injected 
directly into a large vein. The concentration of phenytoin in 
the injected solution should not exceed 10 mg/mL. The usu -
al loading dose is 15 –20 mg/kg: 15 mg/kg for older adults 
and 18 –20 mg/kg for younger adults. Two hours after com -
pleting the infusion, doses of 15 and 18 mg/kg will increase 
the phenytoin serum concentrations in adults by approxi -
mately 20 and 23 μg/mL, respectively.32 The serum phenytoin 
concentration measured 2 h after loading may help to guide 
the timing of its maintenance dose.33 The infusion rate should 
not exceed 50 mg/min in adults and 1 mg/kg/min in children. 
Phenytoin is only slightly soluble at a pH of 7 or less, but 
increases markedly at higher pH values. Parenteral phenyt -
oin is therefore formulated in an aqueous vehicle consisting 
of 40% propylene glycol and 10% ethanol with a pH of 12. This 
may cause pain, burning, or itching sensations, and thrombo -
phlebitis at the infusion site. Purple-glove syndrome is a po -
tentially severe complication with an unknown pathophysi -
ology.34 The IV administration of phenytoin can also cause 
cardiovascular complications such as hypotension and ar -
rhythmia, including ventricular fibrillation. A high concen -
tration of phenytoin and a rapid rate of administration are 
related to these complications.35 The heart rhythm should 
therefore be monitored during the IV administration of phe -
nytoin.
Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin. 
While fosphenytoin itself has no known antiepileptic drug 
activity, it rapidly and completely converts to phenytoin. Af -
ter administration, 1.5 mg of fosphenytoin sodium converts 
to 1 mg of phenytoin sodium. To prevent confusion, fosphe -
nytoin is packed as a milligram phenytoin sodium equiva -
lent (mg PE). Thus, 100 mg PE of fosphenytoin and 100 mg 
of phenytoin yield the same molar amounts of phenytoin 
sodium. Fosphenytoin can be diluted in various solutions 
including dextrose and lactated Ringer solutions. The load -
ing dose of fosphenytoin can range from 15 mg PE/kg to 20 
mg PE/kg, and it can be infused at much faster rates of up to 
150 mg PE/min. Local reactions and cardiovascular compli -
cations associated with IV administration occur significantly 
less often with fosphenytoin than with phenytoin.36
Valproate
Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug exhibiting 
efficacy against all seizure types. The common IV loading 
dose is 15 –45 mg/kg, with an infusion rate of 6 –10 mg/kg/
min.37,38 Valproate is well tolerated, with a low overall inci -
dence of adverse events; dizziness, mild hypotension, and 
mild thrombocytopenia are the most common. Valproate ad -
ministration has been associated with encephalopathy char -www.thejcn.com  5
Kim D et al.JCNacterized by an acute alteration of consciousness. The most 
feared adverse event is fatal hepatotoxicity, for which young 
age is a risk factor.39
Levetiracetam
Levetiracetam is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug with 
a unique mechanism of action and favorable pharmacoki -
netic and safety profiles. The minimal plasma protein bind -
ing of levetiracetam makes drug interactions unlikely. The 
recommended loading dose is 60 mg/kg, with a maximum 
of 4,500 mg.22 Adverse events are usually mild and transient, 
and the most common ones include sedation and thrombo -
cytopenia.40 Levetiracetam can also cause psychiatric adverse 
events such as agitation and psychosis, but such events are 
rarely reported when using levetiracetam to treat SE.41 Leve -
tiracetam is excreted renally, and dose adjustments are rec -
ommended in the presence of renal impairment.
Lacosamide
Lacosamide acts primarily by selectively enhancing the slow 
inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels without in -
terfering with fast inactivation. Animal models of SE have 
shown the potential of lacosamide in seizure suppression and 
neuroprotection.42 Although the current evidence for the use 
of lacosamide is limited, the availability of an IV solution has 
resulted in this drug being increasingly used in the treatment 
of SE.43,44 A systematic review estimated the efficacy of lacos -
amide in the treatment of CSE at 61%;44 however, that system -
atic review used retrospective evidence collected from studies 
performed at heterogeneous therapeutic stages. While the 
most commonly used loading dose was 400 mg, the most ap -
propriate dose remains to be established. One study suggested 
using a dose in excess of 5.3 mg/kg to ensure higher effica -
cy,45 while another recommended 10 –12 mg/kg at an infu -
sion rate of 0.4 mg/kg/min as a safe loading dose.46 Adverse 
events associated with lacosamide are usually mild or mod -
erate, and mainly consist of dizziness, abnormal vision, diplo -
pia, and ataxia. A possible concern about lacosamide acting 
as a sodium-channel modulator is atrioventricular block. 
Lacosamide was found to prolong the PR interval in a dose-
dependent manner.46
Refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus: 
third-line treatment
SE is considered refractory when the first- and second-line 
treatments fail and seizures continue or recur. Such treatment 
resistance reportedly occurs in 23% to 43% of patients with 
SE.47-50 In-hospital mortality of refractory SE has been report -
ed to range between 17% and 39%. The mainstay of treat -
ment in this stage is the continuous administration of IV an -esthetic drugs such as midazolam, barbiturates, and propofol. 
However, there is no clear evidence for guiding the treatment 
of refractory SE. Furthermore, observational studies have as -
sociated the continuous administration of IV anesthetic drugs 
with independent risks of undesirable events and death.51-54 
Hence, the choice of treatment depends on its estimated ben -
efit and risk to individual patients. Applying a loading dose 
of another second-line agent can be beneficial in some pa -
tients with refractory SE. The intensity and duration of the 
continuous infusion of IV anesthetic drugs should be guided 
by continuous EEG monitoring, with a typical regimen in -
volving the maintenance of electrographic seizure cessation 
or burst suppression for at least 24 h before slowly reducing 
the anesthetic agents.
Midazolam
Midazolam is widely used for continuous infusions due to 
its water solubility, rapid onset, and short duration of action. 
However, tolerance to midazolam can increase the dosing 
requirement during continuous infusion.55 Furthermore, the 
increased volume of distribution associated with continuous 
infusion will prolong the elimination of midazolam. Respi -
ratory suppression and hypotension are frequently encoun -
tered during continuous infusion. A 0.2 mg/kg loading dose 
of IV midazolam by bolus injection followed by continuous 
infusion at 0.05 –2 mg/kg/h is recommended.21,56 The infusion 
rate can be increased gradually under guidance from contin -
uous EEG monitoring.
Propofol
Propofol is an anesthetic agent characterized by a rapid on -
set and short duration of action. Furthermore, its favorable 
pharmacokinetic properties and little prolongation of elimi -
nation after long-term continuous infusion are major advan -
tages to its use.57 While its mechanism of action has yet to be 
fully elucidated, propofol seems to stimulate GABA recep -
tors, block N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and 
reduce calcium influx through slow calcium channels.58 
Characterized by lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, renal 
failure, and heart failure, propofol infusion syndrome is a rare 
but dangerous complication of propofol administration. 
Risk factors for propofol infusion syndrome include young 
age, carbohydrate depletion, the concomitant use of cortico -
steroids, and prolonged infusion at high doses (e.g., for lon -
ger than 48 h at dosages exceeding 5 mg/kg/h).59 Other ad -
verse events include hypotension, respiratory suppression, 
bradycardia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Propofol can be ad -
ministered intravenously as a loading bolus of 1 –2 mg/kg. If 
seizures persist, bolus delivery may be repeated until a total 
dose of 5 mg/kg is reached. Continuous infusion can begin 6  J Clin Neurol 2020
Antiepileptic Drug Therapy for Status Epilepticus JCNat a dosage of 5 –10 mg/kg/h and then be gradually reduced 
to a dosage that is sufficient to maintain a burst suppression 
pattern on EEG.26
Thiopental and pentobarbital
Thiopental and pentobarbital are barbiturates that act as GA -
BA A agonists. These drugs tend to accumulate in the body, 
resulting in a prolonged duration of action and delayed recov -
ery after discontinuation. Although barbiturates induce strong 
antiepileptic effects, they have been associated with more ad -
verse events compared with other drugs:60 A meta-analysis 
found pentobarbital to be associated with lower frequencies 
of short-term treatment failure, breakthrough seizures, and 
changes to the infusion of another medication compared with 
midazolam and propofol;61 however, adverse events are re -
portedly more common when taking barbiturates than either 
midazolam or propofol.60-62 Hypotension and respiratory 
suppression are common with the continuous infusion of 
barbiturates, and other adverse events include hepatotoxic -
ity and immunosuppression. It is recommended that thio -
pental be administered at a loading dose of between 1 mg/
kg and 5 mg/kg, with continuous infusion at 0.5 –5 mg/kg/
h.12,23,63,64 Pentobarbital can be administered at a loading dose 
of 5–15 mg/kg,12,21,63 and its infusion rate should not exceed 
50 mg/min, with continuous infusion at 0.5 –5 mg/kg/h being 
recommended. For both drugs, continuous infusion should 
begin at a relatively low rate and then subsequently be titrat -
ed to achieve a burst-suppression pattern on EEG.
Ketamine
Ketamine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. 
Studies suggest that the internalization of inhibitory GAB -
AA receptors and the mobilization of excitatory NMDA re -
ceptors to the membrane are associated with refractory SE.65,66 
As a primary mechanism of action, NMDA-receptor antago -
nism makes ketamine an attractive option for treating re -
fractory SE. Ketamine can also exert anesthetic and analgesic 
effects without profoundly impairing consciousness. Further -
more, the administration of ketamine does not necessarily 
require endotracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation, 
exhibits sympathomimetic properties that are absent in other 
third-line anesthetic agents, and can increase the blood pres -
sure. Ketamine has a short half-life of 2 –3 h. It is primarily me -
tabolized through the cytochrome P450 system. Although ket -
amine had been commonly administered to patients with SE 
refractory to one or more anesthetic agents,67,68 a meta-analy -
sis found the efficacy of ketamine to be as high as 64% across 
3 days when used to address refractory SE, with this efficacy 
decreasing to 32% across 26.5 days.69 
Adverse events associated with ketamine include hyper -tension, increased intracranial pressure, arrhythmia, halluci -
nations, hypersalivation, nausea, and vomiting.69,70 The rec -
ommended loading dose ranges from 0.5 mg/kg to 4.5 mg/
kg, and the recommended dosage range for continuous infu -
sion is 0.3– 5 mg/kg/h.23,60,64 The EEG pattern related to the 
clinical efficacy of ketamine is heterogeneous.69 The cessation 
of seizure activities rather than burst-suppression is recom -
mended as a therapeutic target.
ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG THERAPY  
FOR NONCONVULSIVE STATUS  
EPILEPTICUS
NCSE has been broadly classified as two conditions with 
different prognoses according to the patient’s status: 1) am -
bulatory patients with mild or no impairment of conscious -
ness and electroencephalographic SE (so-called “walking 
wounded” or NCSE proper) and 2) comatose patients with 
electroencephalographic SE (so-called “ictally comatose” or 
comatose NCSE), who have a significantly worse progno -
sis.71,72 This dichotomy of NCSE is maintained in the classifi -
cation of the ILAE Task Force (Fig. 1). NCSE with coma 
could be a manifestation of either uncontrolled CSE (subtle 
SE) or NCSE emerging in critically ill patients with coma. The 
time points of t 1 (after the time at which treatment should be 
started) and t 2 (before the time at which SE should ideally be 
terminated) for NCSE would vary considerably among the 
different subtypes of NCSE. There is little evidence to inform 
the definition of time points in focal NCSE with impaired 
consciousness without coma, but a t 1 of 10 min and a t 2 of >60 
min have been proposed.1 No time points have been estab -
lished for generalized NCSE without coma (i.e., absence SE).
The antiepileptic drug therapy for NCSE is largely inferred 
from that for CSE. However, because the prognosis differs 
across the subtypes as well as their diverse etiologies, the 
treatment of NCSE remains controversial.73 Moreover, there 
is no consensus on how aggressively it should be treated. The 
choice of treatment should take into account the etiology 
and subtype of NCSE as well as the clinical course of each 
patient, with a particular emphasis on the risk-to-benefit ra -
tio of treatment. 
First- and second-line treatments for NCSE follow the 
same protocols as those for CSE. If the first- and second-line 
treatments fail, the administration of additional loading dos -
es of previously unused second-line antiepileptic drugs is rec -
ommended before proceeding to the third-line treatment.73 
As for CSE, there is little evidence for the best anesthetic drug 
to achieve seizure control in NCSE that is refractory to first- 
and second-line treatments. IV anesthetic drugs are report -
edly used to treat from 11% to 69% of patients with refracto -www.thejcn.com  7
Kim D et al.JCNry NCSE.49,53,54,74 It is noteworthy that the risk of IV anesthetic 
drug therapy is likely to be greater in patients with NCSE, es -
pecially in the case of focal NCSE with impaired conscious -
ness without coma.53,54 The outcome is likely to be better in 
NCSE without coma than in CSE or NCSE with coma.72 It is 
recommended that IV anesthetic drugs be avoided when 
treating NCSE patients without coma. The administration of 
newer broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs might be worth 
considering in such cases.73
CONCLUSION
Based on a review of the guidelines and literature performed 
by the Drug Committee of the Korean Epilepsy Society, the 
present review has summarized the recommended approach 
to administering antiepileptic drug therapy for SE. Due to 
the lack of high-quality evidence regarding the treatment of 
SE that has progressed beyond the early stage, many of the 
present recommendations are based on case series or expert 
opinions. Furthermore, the controversies in the literature 
mean that which second- or third-line treatment option is 
superior remains unclear. Hence, the decisions regarding 
treatment should consider the characteristics and circum -
stances of each patient. Novel antiepileptic drugs–especially 
those with parenteral formulations–may lead to new treat -
ment options for SE.75 Moreover, early combinations of an -
tiepileptic drugs with different mechanisms of action might 
be beneficial when treating SE.75,76 However, evidence for 
the efficacy of novel antiepileptic drugs or rational polyther -
apies for SE is still lacking, and so these therapeutic options 
should be applied based on a sound understanding of the 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and mechanism of ac -
tion of each antiepileptic drug whose use is being considered. 
In tandem with the antiepileptic drug therapy, careful search 
for and treatment of the underlying etiology are required.
