Background: Linear alkyl benzene sulfonates (LAS) are the most important ionic detergents that produce negative ions in the 
environment. These compounds enter surface waters through domestic and industrial wastewaters and cause environmental hazards.
Objectives: The present study was aimed at assessing the performance of advanced sequencing batch reactor (SBR) in wastewater 
treatment plant of Yazd, Iran, to remove organic materials and detergents.
Materials and Methods: The present research was a descriptive longitudinal study conducted on 96 input and output samples of SBR 
system over eight months from October 2012 to June 2013. The studied parameters were biochemical oxygen demand 5 (BOD5), chemical 
oxygen demand (COD), and detergents (LAS), which were assessed through standard methods. Finally , the study data were analyzed 
through analysis of variance (ANOVA) using software package for statistical analysis (SPSS).
Results: The mean inputs of BOD5, COD, and LAS to the SBR system were 292.40 ± 45.28, 597.15 ± 97.30, and 3.29 ± 0.92 mg/L, and the mean 
outputs were 20.59 ± 3.54, 59.34 ± 9.47, and 0.606 ± 0.09 mg/L, respectively . The removal efficiency of BOD5, COD and LAS were respectively 
92.95%, 90.06% and 81.6%. The results of ANOVA indicated that there was a significant relationship between the mean inputs and outputs 
of BOD5, COD, and the detergents (P ≤ 0.001).
Conclusions: With the proper operation of wastewater the treatment plant and increasing the retention time, the removal efficiency 
of the detergents increased. In addition, according to the environmental standards for BOD5, COD and the detergents, the results of the 
present study indicated that the outputs of these parameters from the SBR system were appropriate for agricultural irrigation.

Due to the rapid increase in the population and the short -
age of water resources in recent years, human beings have 
seriously threatened the wildlife by polluting the water re -
sources. Municipal and industrial wastewaters are among 
the pollutants of the environment, especially water re -
sources. By entering the surface waters, these pollutants 
not only endanger human’s health and the environment, 
but also cause biological problems for animals and plants 
(1). Nowadays, there are a wide variety of wastewater treat -
ment systems; however, sequencing batch reactor (SBR) 
seems to be the most promising and appropriate modified 
activated sludge process which can be utilized to remove 
carbon and nitrogen organic matters (2-5). In recent years, 
SBR has been widely used to treat industrial and municipal 
wastewater because of its low cost and suitable efficiency 
in pollutant removal (6-8). The process is composed of five 
stages as filling, reaction, settling, effluent and idle (9, 10). 
The intermittent cycle extension aeration system (ICEAS) or advanced SBR process is a variant of an SBR system 
where the processes of biological oxidation, nitrification, 
phosphorous removal and liquids/solids separation can 
be achieved continuously in a single tank. What makes 
the ICEAS process different is a continuous inflow , even 
during the settle and decant phases of the operating cycle. 
Wastewater flow continuously fills up the reactor and dis -
continuously discharges (11). In this process, wastewater 
enters the reactor and after physical and biological pro -
cesses exits. To improve the performance of the process, 
two or more reactors with predetermined orders are uti -
lized. All the necessary processes in this method are chron -
ologically conducted in a pool. Through alternate use of 
aerobic and anaerobic processes in the SBR system, large 
amounts of organic matter and nutrients can be removed 
(12, 13). The SBRs performance is satisfactory in treating 
domestic wastewater. The quality of effluent has been re -
ported 20 and 5 mg/L for chemical oxygen demand (COD) Eslami H et al.
Jundishapur J Health Sci. 2015;7(3):e2962034and biochemical oxygen demand 5 (BOD5), respectively , by 
Lamine et al. (14). Zhou et al. (15) studied the capability of 
SBR in treating landfill leachate. The study resulted in up 
to 94% and 98% of COD and BOD5 removal. In another study 
by Goncalves et al. (16) a SBR unit operated for organic re -
moval from wool dyeing effluent. COD and BOD5 removal 
rates were 85% and 95%, respectively . The SBR system can be 
used in biological treatment of different types of industri -
al and municipal wastewaters (17). Different studies have 
been conducted on treatment of biological wastewater of 
olive oil industry (18), wastewaters containing antibiotics 
(19), removal of cyanide from wastewater of electroplat -
ing industry (20), textile industry wastewater (21), waste -
waters containing phenol (22), coal industry wastewaters 
(23), wastewaters with high concentrations of nitrogen 
(12), and domestic wastewaters and waste leachate (24).
More than 100,000 synthetic chemicals such as deter -
gents are used in a variety of domestic and industrial ap -
plications and numerous studies have documented that 
many of these compounds are incompletely degraded 
or removed during wastewater treatment and are per -
sistent in the aquatic environment (25). Detergents are a 
group of chemicals that have cleansing properties. These 
compounds have a polar hydrophilic group and a nonpo -
lar hydrocarbon branch (hydrophobic) (26). These com -
pounds enter surface waters through domestic and in -
dustrial wastewaters and cause environmental hazards. 
Linear alkyl benzene sulfonates (LAS) are the most impor -
tant ionic detergents which produce negative ions in the 
environment. LASs are utilized in household detergents 
like washing powder, dishwashing detergent, etc.(17, 18). 
In aquatic environment, detergents float on the surface 
of water as a surface layer and disfigure the aquatic envi -
ronment, reduce gas exchange and endanger the aquatic 
animals’ health by decreasing the dissolved oxygen. 
These compounds change the taste and smell of the wa -
ter, produce fume on the surface of water, cause disrup -
tion in the process of water and wastewater treatment, 
increase the treatment costs, and lead to aquatic animals’ 
death (27-30).
2. Objectives
Due to the appropriate properties of the SBR system 
for wastewater treatment and the inefficiency of other 
wastewater treatment systems of Yazd in removing de -
tergents, Yazd’s company of water and wastewater has 
designed an Advanced SBR system to treat the municipal 
wastewater. In this regard, the present study was con -
ducted to determine the performance of advanced SBR 
in Yazd wastewater treatment plant to remove organic 
materials and detergents.
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Wastewater Characteristics
Raw wastewater with the following qualitative and quantitative properties was fed to the SBR system in the 
Yazd wastewater treatment plant.
3.2. The Schematic of Yazd Wastewater Treatment 
Plant
In this system, before wastewater enters the SBR sys -
tem, it passes two initial treatment units consisting of a 
screening and a grit chamber and is then discharged into 
the reactors. In this process, six SBRs are simultaneously 
employed. The dimension of each reactor was as follows: 
the length 40 meters, the width 23.75, and the depth 6.6 
meters. Afterwards, inside each reactor, mixing operation 
with a retention time of 0.9 hour and aeration operation 
with a retention time of 2.5 hours get conducted. When 
the biological treatment ends, sedimentation operation 
with a retention time of one hour begins and lasts until 
complete discharge of clarified effluent with a retention 
time of half an hour. All of these phases are conducted 
in one reactor and the total retention time is 4.9 hours. 
Extra sludge is also discharged from the system in each 
treatment period.
3.3. Sampling and Experiments
The present research was a descriptive longitudinal 
study conducted over eight months. Composite sampling 
was carried out on a daily basis from October 2012 to June 
2013. In this regard, special containers (1 L) for wastewa -
ter sampling were utilized to collect samples from the 
input and output of the SBR system in Yazd wastewater 
treatment plant. Therefore, six samples per month and 
48 samples during the eight-month period from the out -
put and 48 samples from the input of the plant, equal to 
a total of 96 samples were collected for further analysis 
and examination.
The experiments conducted on the samples included 
BOD5, COD, and detergents (LAS). After sampling, the sam -
ples were taken to the chemistry laboratory of the faculty 
of health, Shahid Sadoughi university of medical sciences, 
Yazd, and the abovementioned parameters were measured 
according to the guidelines of the standard methods (31). 
Due to the importance of measuring the detergents, the 
measurement method is explained below .
The utilized materials and instruments included 
chloroform, sodium hydroxide, phenolphthalein in -
dex solution, standard LAS solution, 1 N sulfuric acid, 
standard stock solution of LAS, detergent, and separat -
ing funnels. First, the sample wastewaters were spilled 
into the separating funnels, and then by adding drops 
of 1 N NaOH and using 10 drops of phenolphthalein, the 
solutions became alkaline. The pink color was removed 
by adding drops of H2SO4. To prevent the formation of 
emulsion, 10 mL chloroform, 25 mL blue methylene 
and 10 mL isopropyl alcohol were added to the sam -
ples. The funnels were shaken for 30 minutes so that 
the phases would separate. By tilting the funnels and 
opening their valves slowly, the accumulated pressure Eslami H et al.35
Jundishapur J Health Sci. 2015;7(3):e29620was released. Some samples needed more time to sepa -
rate. Before the chloroform layers were discharged, the 
samples were shaken slowly so that they could settle. 
Therefore, the chloroform phase placed at the bottom 
and the aqueous phase positioned on top. After the lay -
ers separated, the chloroform layer was spilled into an -
other separating funnel and the first funnel tube was 
washed with some chloroform. Afterwards, by adding 
10 mL of chloroform in each cycle, the extraction was 
repeated three times. All of the resulting substances 
from the chloroform extraction were spilled in the sec -
ond funnel; then, 50 mL detergent solution was added 
and the funnel was severely shaken for 30 minutes. No 
emulsion was formed in this solution. After sedimen -
tation, the contents were shaken and the chloroform 
layer, separated from the aqueous layer, was transmit -
ted to a 10-mL volumetric flask. The detergent solution 
was again extracted using 10 mL chloroform and the 
result was added to the previous volumetric flask. This 
process was repeated once more to make sure about the 
precision of the experiment and the volume of the ex -
tracted chloroform reached 100 mL after it was spilled 
into the volumetric flask. Afterwards, the cap of the 
flask was replaced and it was slightly turned to prevent 
sedimentation. Prior to the final measurements, the 
flask was turned several times to mix the contents. The absorptions of the standard samples were measured 
against the control chloroform at 652 nm using a spec -
trophotometer. Using the prepared standard absorp -
tion rate and concentration, the calibration curve was 
drawn and the LAS concentration was measured (31). Fi -
nally , the collected data were analyzed through analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) using software package for statisti -
cal analysis (SPSS) version 18.0.
4. Results
The results of the experiments of input and output 
BOD5, COD and detergents are presented in Tables 2 and 
3. The removal percentages of these parameters are indi -
cated in Figures 1 and 2.
The results indicated that during the eight-month peri -
od, the removal efficiencies of BOD5 and COD were 92.95% 
and 90.06%, respectively . ANOVA also showed that there 
was a significant relationship between the input and out -
put means of BOD5 and COD (P ≤ 0.001).
The results indicated that the total mean of the deter -
gents decreased from 3.29 to 0.6. ANOVA also showed that 
there was a significant relationship between the input 
and output means of the detergents (P ≤ 0.001). More -
over, the mean removal rate of the detergents was 81.6% 
(Table 3).

5. Discussion
The results of the study by Fernandes et al. (2) on domes -
tic wastewater treatment using SBR process with limited 
air indicated that the removal efficiency of COD was 83% 
which is lower than the corresponding value of the pres -
ent study . This difference can be attributed to different 
air strategies employed in the two studies (2).
Ghahfarrokhi et al. (34) conducted a study on removal of 
detergents from hospital wastewaters using SBR method 
and indicated removal efficiencies of 94.54%, 92.97% and 
84.99% for BOD5, COD and detergents, respectively . These 
results are in agreement with those of the present study 
and indicate that in appropriate conditions, SBR system 
can remove more than 90% of BOD5 and COD and more 
than 80% of detergents from wastewaters (34). In a study 
on removal efficiency of BOD5, COD and detergents, Eh -
rampoush et al. (35) concluded that artificial subsurface 
constructed wetland system has lower removal efficiency 
compared to the SBR system.
Other studies investigated the use of the SBR method in 
treating different types of industrial wastewaters; how -
ever, their results indicated lower removal efficiency of 
COD compared to the present study (4, 20, 23, 24). There -
fore, the SBR system performs better in treating munici -
pal wastewaters that contain organic matters with high -
er biodegradability compared to industrial wastewaters.
In a study by Pirsaheb et al. (36) the average of LAS re -
moval in extended aeration process in winter and sum -
mer were 94.06% and 99.23%, respectively . In a study by 
Duarte et al. degradation of LAS in anaerobic SBR (ASBR) 
was evaluated. Degradation of the surfactant at the end 
of the operation was 87% and removal of chemical oxygen 
demand was 86% (37). One study encompassed a total of 
50 municipal wastewater sites and included 15 activated 
sludge systems, 12 trickling filters, six oxidation ditches, 
eight lagoons, and nine rotating biological contactors 
(RBC). The influent concentrations of LAS for all the treat -
ment plants showed a normal distribution with a mean 
of 5 mg/L. The average effluent LAS concentrations ranged 
from 0.04 mg/L for activated sludge plants to about 1 
mg/L for trickling filter plants. A range of removal rates 
over 99% for activated sludge treatment (11). LAS removal from wastewater by aerobic processes in well-designed 
municipal wastewater treatment plants was above 90% 
(38). As observed, detergents removal efficiency in our 
system was a little less than other systems that may have 
been caused by the operation of the wastewater treat -
ment plant in undesirable condition (36).
The presence of surfactants in the influent could cause 
floc saponification, which decreases the floc dimensions 
and increases the floc circularity . This results in poor 
sludge settling and washout of biomass in the system (38). 
In a study by Rittmann et al. (39) they found that when LAS 
stays in solution it will rapidly degrade, but slow desorp -
tion of LAS initially sorbed to the sludge occurs, which may 
limit biodegradation rates due to limited bioavailability . 
Therefore, by increasing the retention time in the aeration 
stage, the removal efficiency of LAS will increase.
The collected data indicated that the removal efficien -
cies of BOD5, COD, and detergents were lower in cold 
months compared to warm ones and this is consistent 
with Pirsaheb et al. results (36). This can be attributed to 
the fact that microorganisms are less active in cold envi -
ronments; therefore, removal efficiency in wastewater 
treatment systems drops and rises as temperature falls 
and increases (40).
With the proper operation of the wastewater treatment 
plant and increasing the retention time, the removal effi -
ciency of detergents increases. According to the environ -
mental standards of BOD5, COD, and detergents issued by 
the Department of Environment (32), the results of the 
present study indicated that the outputs of these param -
eters were appropriate and standard for agricultural and 
irrigation uses.
