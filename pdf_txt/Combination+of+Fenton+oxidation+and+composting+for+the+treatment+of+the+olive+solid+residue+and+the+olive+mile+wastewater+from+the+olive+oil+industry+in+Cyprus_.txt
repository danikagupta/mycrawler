Abstract: Advanced oxidation procedures (AOPs) refer to a variety of technical procedures that
produce OH radicals to sufÔ¨Åciently oxidize wastewater, organic pollutant streams, and toxic efÔ¨Çuents
from industrial, hospital, pharmaceutical and municipal wastes. Through the implementation of such
procedures, the (post) treatment of such waste efÔ¨Çuents leads to products that are more susceptible
to bioremediation, are less toxic and possess less pollutant load. The basic mechanism produces
free OH radicals and other reactive species such as superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, etc. A
basic classiÔ¨Åcation of AOPs is presented in this short review, analyzing the processes of UV/H 2O2,
Fenton and photo-Fenton, ozone-based (O 3) processes, photocatalysis and sonolysis from chemical
and equipment points of view to clarify the nature of the reactive species in each AOP and their
advantages. Finally, combined AOP implementations are favored through the literature as an efÔ¨Åcient
solution in addressing the issue of global environmental waste management.

1. Introduction
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) comprise environmentally friendly and in-
novative techniques in order to treat wastewater and enrich anti-pollutant technology
procedures [ 1‚Äì3]. The environmental impacts of the above processes are considered to
be of high importance due to the high reaction rates and efÔ¨Åciencies, as well as the lack
of highly dangerous byproducts promoting green chemistry aspects [ 2‚Äì8]. Common to
all advanced oxidation processes is the formation of hydroxyl radicals ( OH), which are
capable of acting as the main group of chemicals towards the decontamination and/or
biodegradation of highly toxic and heavy pollutants in many Ô¨Åelds of the global circular
economy [ 6,9‚Äì16]. These processes enhance the oxidation kinetics for the mineralization of
contaminants to carbon dioxide or to other harmless or beneÔ¨Åcial byproducts, especially
in water puriÔ¨Åcation systems [ 17,18]. ClassiÔ¨Åcations are reported in the literature consid-
ering the source of the production of hydroxyl radicals. Amongst numerous oxidizing
chemicals described in the literature, the dominant classiÔ¨Åcation is mainly categorizing
AOPs [ 1,4,5,7,12,19‚Äì24] into (a) UV‚Äìhydrogen peroxide processes, (b) Fenton and photo-
Fenton, (c) ozone-based processes, (d) photocatalysis and (e) sonolysis. Although reviews
on the use of AOPs for puriÔ¨Åcation systems have been reported in the literature [ 2,7,25], the
ChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8. https://doi.org/10.3390/chemengineering6010008 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/chemengineeringChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 2 of 22
scope of this review is to coherently present and summarize the key points in each process,
to classify the aspects of the chemical reactions and fully comprehend the role of each AOP .
Schematic illustrations and classiÔ¨Åcations are presented in order to properly comprehend
the basic concepts and uses of each AOP . This review offers the ability to easily encourage
the proper choice of AOP for speciÔ¨Åc wastewater. Finally, the beneÔ¨Åts of the combined use
of AOP techniques are reported and typical reactor paradigms are referred to in each AOP
presented from an engineering point of view.
2. UV/H 2O2(Ultraviolet/Hydrogen Peroxide Processes)
Generally, the presence of UV light radiation, if properly combined with hydrogen
peroxide, may effectively produce OH radicals; simultaneously, UV light acts as a natural
disinfectant agent for many organic pollutants and wastewater systems. The applications
of such systems have been reported in many fields, varying from the pharmaceutical sec-
tor[26‚Äì28] to the textile industry [9,29] , organic pollutant removal [ 3,10,23,30‚Äì33], etc. [ 34‚Äì36].
The chemistry of this procedure has been investigated by modeling the mechanisms and
processes [ 29,37], concluding that the substitution of expensive H 2O2with other chemicals,
such as Cl 2, may be a useful alternative and excellent candidate at low pH values and low UV
doses [ 38]. The main chemical reaction occurring in such systems is described below [ 2,29,39]:
H2O2+hv!2OH (1)
Through the effect of radiation, the hydrogen peroxide molecules form OH radi-
cals. This decomposition is attributed to a Haber‚ÄìWeiss mechanism, which is initiated by
cleavage of the O‚ÄìO bond. Further chemical OH production is initiated by the following
reactions [40]:
H2O2+OH!H2O+HO
2 (2)
H2O2+HO
2!H2O+O2+OH (3)
However, in some cases, radical recombination occurs, as follows [41]:
OH +HO!H2O2 (4)
OH +HO
2!H2O+O2 (5)
HO
2+HO
2!H2O2+O2 (6)
Many factors affect the efÔ¨Åciency of the above reactions, such as the concentration of
hydrogen peroxide, the source of UV radiation and the physicochemical characteristics of
Ô¨Çuid involved in the oxidation process. In Figure 1, the effect of the H 2O2concentration is
indicative of the degradation of carbamazepine.
Equations (1)‚Äì(6) are used by different groups to describe the synergistic utilization
of UV radiation and H 2O2. For example, Verma et al. [ 28] described the combination of
UV-C radiation and H 2O2for the successful degradation of the toxic anatoxin-a, suggest-
ing the alternative effect of the harsher UV-C radiation instead of UV-A. Anatoxin-A is
extremely toxic; therefore, the experiments were conducted in Lamil Plus Class II micro-
biological safety cabinets (Karstulan Metalli Tek-Fin Oy, Finland). The UV radiation was
produced by DUV LEDs (TO39FW), developed by Sensor Electronic Technology, Columbia.
Bagheri et al. [ 32] tried to overcome the excess recombination using only vacuum-UV
processes, emphasizing the effect of Ô¨Çuid concentrations. A prototype annular photoreactor
made of Plexiglas was photo-assisted by mercury 42 W amalgam lamps; all these experi-
ments were conducted under continuous Ô¨Çow. These parameters were also investigated
by Crapulli et al. [ 37], for mechanistic modelling, combining different concentrations and
UV radiation wavelengths in order to estimate the higher penetration depths of hydroxyl
radicals (OH). Their concentration proÔ¨Åles were gathered under air- and oxygen-saturated
conditions corresponding to Re = 1587 over a period of 60 min in a vacuum-UV reactor
with cooling capabilities maintaining constant power consumption. Zoschke et al. [ 39]ChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 3 of 22
concluded that UV radiation with an alternative medium, such as O 3, is more effective than
H2O2. All experiments were performed in custom-made laboratory-scale reactors, under
a UV lamp with nominal power ranging from 11 to 60 W and volume reactor capacities
from 0.1 to 3.1 L. Their reactor setup included a glass tank, a pump and a stainless-steal
irradiation reactor tube holding the UV lamp. Nevertheless, the main asset from this AOP is
the strong synergy of the photolytic dissociation of H 2O2, along with photolytic activity [ 3].
Especially in the pharmaceutical industry, decomposition of the products requires the
energy of this AOP in order to achieve maximum efÔ¨Åciency of the reactions [ 2,26,38,39].
The UV/H 2O2process has the major advantage of utilizing UV light as a disinfectant in
order to deactivate microorganisms; the radiation also assists the photolysis of hydrogen
peroxide into the reactive hydroxyl radicals ( OH) needed for the process. In addition, this
process is an advantageous option for treating natural and wastewater with turbid Ô¨Çows,
utilizing the lower scattering of light. Even though some of its applications are more viable
than others (such as the mineralization of some compounds found in water, including
some residual pharmaceuticals), the overall conclusion is that UV/H 2O2systems have
found their place at the top of the list of the most promising technologies for water and
wastewater treatment [10,21,28,35].

bia. Bagheri et al. [32] tried to overcome the excess recombination using only vacuum-UV 
processes, emphasizing the effect of fluid concentrations. A prototype annular photoreac-
tor made of Plexiglas was phot o-assisted by mercury 42 W amalgam lamps; all these ex-
periments were conducted under continuous flow. These parameters were also investi-gated by Crapulli et al. [37], for mechanisti c modelling, combining different concentra-
tions and UV radiation wavelengths in order to  estimate the higher penetration depths of 
hydroxyl radicals (‚Ä¢OH). Their concentration profiles were gathered under air- and oxy-
gen-saturated conditions corresponding to Re = 1587 over a period of 60 min in a vacuum-
UV reactor with cooling capabilities maintaining constant power consumption. Zoschke 
et al. [39] concluded that UV radiation with an alternative medium, such as O
3, is more 
effective than H 2O2. All experiments were performed in custom-made laboratory-scale re-
actors, under a UV lamp with nominal power ranging from 11 to 60 W and volume reactor capacities from 0.1 to 3.1 L. Their reactor setup included a glass tank, a pump and a stain-
less-steal irradiation reactor tube holding the UV lamp. Nevertheless, the main asset from 
this AOP is the strong synergy of the photolytic dissociation of H
2O2, along with photo-
lytic activity [3]. Especially in the pharmaceutical industry, decomposition of the products 
requires the energy of this AOP in order to achieve maximum efficiency of the reactions 
[2,26,38,39]. The UV/H 2O2 process has the major advantage of utilizing UV light as a dis-
infectant in order to deactivate microorganism s; the radiation also assists the photolysis 
of hydrogen peroxide into the reactive hydroxyl radicals (‚Ä¢OH) needed for the process. 
In addition, this process is an advantageous  option for treating natural and wastewater 
with turbid flows, utilizing the lower scattering of light. Even though some of its applica-tions are more viable than others (such as the mineralization of some compounds found 
in water, including some residual pharmaceuticals), the overall conclusion is that 
UV/H
2O2 systems have found their place at the top of the list of the most promising tech-
nologies for water and wastewater treatment [10,21,28,35].

3. Fenton and Photo-Fenton
Radical and heavy pollutants necessitate the use of UV radiation with more effective
species, which will ensure higher catalyst effectivity at different working pH conditions [ 7].
In Fenton processes, reactions are favored due to the use of cheaper and less hazardous
materials, simpler and less sophisticated equipment, along with ecologically meaningful
cyclic reuse of reactants. The Fenton process was introduced by Fenton [ 43], who tried
to enhance the dissociation of H 2O2under highly acidic conditions. The reactions are
described by the simpliÔ¨Åed equations as follows [44]:
Fe2++H2O2!Fe3++OH +OH (7)
H2O2+OH!H2O+HO
2 (8)
Fe2++OH!Fe3++OH (9)ChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 4 of 22
Fe3++HO
2!Fe2++O2+H+(10)
OH +OH!H2O2 (11)
Organic pollutant +OH!degraded products (12)
This synergistic combination of such radicals has been proven more effective in heavy
and large molecules [ 7,12,35,45,46], without diminishing the ability to use AOPs in wastew-
ater [ 45‚Äì47], landÔ¨Åll pretreatment [ 2,48] and drinking water puriÔ¨Åcation [ 2,3]. In 1894,
H.J.H. Fenton published the Ô¨Årst research on the capabilities of Fe2+ions to drastically
oxidize chemicals under speciÔ¨Åc conditions. The reaction solution was named after him,
and later recognized as ‚ÄúFenton reagent‚Äù. Although this reagent is currently known as
a mixture of H 2O2and Fe2+ions, and the oxidation procedure is capable of successfully
treating a wide range of waste streams, the moieties that are produced and are responsible
for the oxidation is still under scientiÔ¨Åc research and debate [49‚Äì51].
Although Fenton‚Äôs reagent was discovered over 100 years ago, its use as an oxidizing
process for destroying high-molecular organic toxic substances was not applied until the
1960s [ 52]. The main beneÔ¨Åt from applications of the Fenton process is the comprehensive
damage of pollutants to harmless compounds, e.g., CO 2, H2O and inorganic salts. Fenton‚Äôs
method is considered as an ‚Äúon‚Äìoff‚Äù process compared with other biological methods;
moreover, it is environmentally friendly (decomposes into O 2and H 2O), easy to apply,
cost-effective, and can easily be applied for the treatment of wastewater [ 50], olive oil mill
waste [49], the de-colorization of textile wastewater [53], etc.
The Fenton method involves four phases. Initially, the pH is modiÔ¨Åed to low acidity.
Then, the main oxidation reaction takes place at pH values between 3 and 5. The wastewater
is then neutralized at pH values of 7 to 8, usually using NaOH or CaOH to stop the reaction;
at the end, precipitation occurs [49,54‚Äì56].
During the process, the OH radicals are produced through the decomposition of H 2O
at pH < 6, and within a time window of 1 10 3s, it reacts with the organic substances
(RH) in the pollutant. The assumed reactions are as follows:
Fe2++H2O2!Fe3++OH +OH
RH+OH!R+H2O
R+Fe3+!product +Fe2+
Fe2++OH!Fe3++OH 
Fe3++H2O2!Fe2++H++HO
2(13)
The combination of UV radiation with Fe2+or Fe3+enhances the rate of degradation
of the pollutant. This photo-Fenton AOP is hindered only by the accumulation of Fe3+
ions, which are inhibitors to the process. During this AOP , however, more OH radicals are
reproduced through photochemical regeneration by UV/solar radiation, according to the
following reactions:
Fe3++H2O+hv!Fe2++OH +H+(14)
Fe3++H2O2+hv!Fe2++H++HO
2 (15)
In low pH environments (ca. 2‚Äì3), Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions are more
favored and stable. All reactions described in Equation (13) are favored at such pH values,
producing more soluble and active Fe2+and Fe3+ions [ 57,58]. The typical effects of pH
value on methyl orange degradation is shown in Figure 2.ChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 5 of 22

The combination of UV radiation with Fe2+ or Fe3+ enhances the rate of degradation 
of the pollutant. This photo-Fenton AOP is  hindered only by the accumulation of Fe3+ ions, 
which are inhibitors to the process. During th is AOP, however, more OH radicals are re-
produced through photochemical regeneration by UV/solar radiation, according to the 
following reactions:

22 2Fe H O hv Fe H HO++ + ‚Ä¢++ ‚Üí + + (15)
In low pH environments (ca. 2‚Äì3), Fenton  and photo-Fenton reactions are more fa-
vored and stable. All reactions described in Eq uation (13) are favored at such pH values, 
producing more soluble and active Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions [57,58]. The typical effects of pH 
value on methyl orange degradation is shown in Figure 2.

[57,58]). 
Fenton and photo-Fenton processes have b een described in the literature by Mahdad 
et al. [59]. The use of such processes for the post-treatment of leachate in municipal solid 
waste significantly lowered the COD content,  simultaneously increasing the BOD/COD 
ratio. The photo-Fenton process resulted in prominent results in color and COD reduction, 
in comparison with the Fenton process. Parameters including pH, H 2O2 concentration, UV 
radiation time and iron sulfate dosage contribu te to estimations of the efficient parameters 
in the above processes. 
Punzi et al. [60] validated the photo-Fenton  process over the degradation of a textile 
azo-dye. The results were monitored by cust om-made anaerobic 0.6 L glass reactors, to-
tally covered with a biofilm. The results s eemed efficient, because COD reduction >90% 
was reported during the post-treatment, whil e simultaneously achieving reductions in 
toxicity. Fiorentino et al. [61] used a solar-dr iven Fenton process for the treatment of real 
urban wastewater purification. They managed to  surpass the pH barrier for sufficient bac-
terial inactivation and antibiotic degradation,  although were not able to fully control the 
environmental impact of the byproducts. Thei r research was equipped with two identical 
polyvinylchloride batch mode reactors of  15 L capacity under constant 21 W/m2 solar ra-
diation. Further research is reported [12,23 ] on the aspects and conditions through which 
Fenton-like processes are affecting pharmaceutical treatments in natural waters and 
Figure 2. pH effect on methyl orange degradation in the Fenton process (adapted and edited

Fenton and photo-Fenton processes have been described in the literature by Mah-
dad et al. [ 59]. The use of such processes for the post-treatment of leachate in municipal solid
waste signiÔ¨Åcantly lowered the COD content, simultaneously increasing the BOD/COD
ratio. The photo-Fenton process resulted in prominent results in color and COD reduction,
in comparison with the Fenton process. Parameters including pH, H 2O2concentration, UV
radiation time and iron sulfate dosage contribute to estimations of the efÔ¨Åcient parameters
in the above processes.
Punzi et al. [ 60] validated the photo-Fenton process over the degradation of a textile
azo-dye. The results were monitored by custom-made anaerobic 0.6 L glass reactors,
totally covered with a bioÔ¨Ålm. The results seemed efÔ¨Åcient, because COD reduction >90%
was reported during the post-treatment, while simultaneously achieving reductions in
toxicity. Fiorentino et al. [ 61] used a solar-driven Fenton process for the treatment of real
urban wastewater puriÔ¨Åcation. They managed to surpass the pH barrier for sufÔ¨Åcient
bacterial inactivation and antibiotic degradation, although were not able to fully control the
environmental impact of the byproducts. Their research was equipped with two identical
polyvinylchloride batch mode reactors of 15 L capacity under constant 21 W/m2solar
radiation. Further research is reported [ 12,23] on the aspects and conditions through which
Fenton-like processes are affecting pharmaceutical treatments in natural waters and organic
pollutants. The conclusion that conventional wastewater treatments are not as prominent
as Fenton-like AOPs is encouraging the researchers to use more environmentally friendly
and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù chemical procedures. Finally, in the Ô¨Åeld of mining, Wang et al. [ 62] veriÔ¨Åed
the effectiveness of Fenton processes in catalyzing lactate in pyrite minerals. The process
produced in situ OH radicals and H 2O2and the lactate oxidation lasted 10 d, demonstrating
the potential of the process in wastewater treatment. Batch reactors made of 30 mL Pyrex
vials were used with TeÔ¨Çon septa and rubber gaskets. The irradiation light source was a
500 W tungsten iodine lamp under a 340‚Äì3500 nm wavelength.
Fenton and photo-Fenton processes exploit the advantages of both the Fe reagent and
UV radiation to the highest degree. Organic pollutants are favored by the capability of
Fe ions to react with several active pollutants, especially in water puriÔ¨Åcation procedures.ChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 6 of 22
The rates depend on the pH value of the aqueous solution; however, wastes with values of
acidic pH are mostly favored [ 21,41,42,52]. In general, homogeneous Fenton processes, the
major disadvantage is outlined as the rates of the reactions, which are particularly slow,
especially at high pH values. In addition, the products possess very high concentrations
of metal-containing sludge. The method, by itself, lacks efÔ¨Åciency, and the heterogeneous
Fenton process is often utilized due to the low requirements of the sludge preparation step,
leading to lower operational costs [7,12,42].
4. Electro-Fenton
There has been growing attention to the use of electrochemical methods for treating
hazardous wastes. The organic and toxic pollutants contained in such type of wastes, such
as phenols, which exist in the structure of liquid olive oil waste, pesticides, etc., are usually
destroyed by anodic oxidation as a result of the creation of oxidants such as hydroxyl
radicals, ozone, etc. [ 63]. Electrochemical oxidation has been effectively applied in domestic
sewage, the puriÔ¨Åcation of olive oil wastewater [ 64], leachates from landÔ¨Åll sites [ 64],
tannery and textile wastes [ 65,66], methyl parathion pesticide [ 63], etc. These methods are
considered as environmentally friendly, because they do not use any other type of toxic
substances (Figure 3). Electrochemical oxidation depends on the concentration of the prime
solution such as NaCl, the pH, the range of temperature, as well as the recirculation time
and the size and type of the anode and voltage applied. The electrochemical reactions are
very complex and well known. However, considering that the anode is a Ti/Pt electrode,
the following reactions characterized the electrochemical oxidation of aqueous solutions,
which contain organic matter [63].

organic pollutants. The conclusion that conv entional wastewater treatments are not as 
prominent as Fenton-like AOPs is encouragin g the researchers to use more environmen-
tally friendly and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù chemical procedures. Finally, in the field of mining, Wang et al. [62] verified the effectiveness of Fenton proce sses in catalyzing lactate in pyrite minerals. 
The process produced in situ OH radicals and H
2O2 and the lactate oxidation lasted 10 d, 
demonstrating the potential of the process in wastewater treatment. Batch reactors made 
of 30 mL Pyrex vials were used with Teflon septa and rubber gaskets. The irradiation light 
source was a 500 W tungsten iodine lamp under a 340‚Äì3500 nm wavelength.  
Fenton and photo-Fenton processes exploit the advantages of both the Fe reagent and 
UV radiation to the highest degree. Organic po llutants are favored by the capability of Fe 
ions to react with several active pollutants, especially in water purification procedures. 
The rates depend on the pH value of the aque ous solution; however, wastes with values 
of acidic pH are mostly favored [21,41,42,52].  In general, homogeneous Fenton processes, 
the major disadvantage is outlined as the ra tes of the reactions, which are particularly 
slow, especially at high pH values. In additi on, the products possess  very high concentra-
tions of metal-containing sludge. The method, by itself, lacks efficiency, and the heteroge-
neous Fenton process is often utilized due to  the low requirements of the sludge prepara-
tion step, leading to lower operational costs [7,12,42]. 
4. Electro-Fenton 
There has been growing attention to the us e of electrochemical methods for treating 
hazardous wastes. The organic and toxic pollutan ts contained in such type of wastes, such 
as phenols, which exist in the structure of liquid olive oil waste, pesticides, etc., are usually 
destroyed by anodic oxidation as a result of the creation of oxidants such as hydroxyl 
radicals, ozone, etc. [63]. Electrochemical oxidation has been effectively applied in domes-
tic sewage, the purification of olive oil wastewater [64], leachates from landfill sites [64], 
tannery and textile wastes [65,66], methyl parathion pesticide [63], etc. These methods are considered as environmentally friendly, becaus e they do not use any other type of toxic 
substances (Figure 3). Electrochemical oxid ation depends on the concentration of the 
prime solution such as NaCl, the pH, the range of temperature, as well as the recirculation time and the size and type of the anode and voltage applied. The electrochemical reactions 
are very complex and well known. However, considering that the anode is a Ti/Pt elec-
trode, the following reactions characterized the electrochemical oxidation of aqueous so-
lutions, which contain organic matter [63].  
 
Figure 3. Electro-Fenton schematic (adapted from [63]).
All reactions were conducted in the electrochemical reactor, which contained reaction
solutions, electrolytes, an anode and a cathode. Initially, the anode discharged the water,
producing hydroxyl radicals which were adsorbed onto the active sites of the electrode
surface (M[ ]), according to the following reaction:
H2O + M[ ]!M[OH ] + H++ e (16)
Subsequently, the absorbed hydroxyl radical oxidized the organic matter as follows:
R + M[OH ]!M[ ] + RO + H++ e (17)ChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 7 of 22
where RO denotes the oxidized organic matter, which can be continuously formed by
the hydroxyl radicals. Due to their high oxidation potential, the radicals OH, Oand
ClOHhave a very rapid lifetime compared with other oxidants (i.e., Cl 2, ClO 2, O2, O3and
H2O2). Principal (Cl 2and O 2) as well as secondary (H 2O2, O3and ClO 2) oxidants which
are produced from the degradation process exhibit a relatively long life and are diffused
into the areas away from the electrodes continuing the oxidation process (indirect oxida-
tion). Due to catalytic activity of the anode, direct electro-chemical oxidation is affected,
as are the diffusion rates of organic compounds at the active points of the anode and the
applied current density. On the other hand, indirect electrochemical oxidation processes are
inÔ¨Çuenced by the circulation rates of secondary oxidants within the solution, the pH and
the temperature range. Secondary oxidants do not convert all pollutants to H 2O and CO 2;
therefore, effective contaminant deprivation is constructed through the electrochemical
process. In solutions with pH < 6, the oxidation process creates secondary ions and free
radicals (ClO , O3, etc.) which, in turn, act as oxidation agents. In moderate alkaline pH
conditions, these radicals are produced with the addition of some H 2O2through a cycle
of chloride and chlorine products, whereas in strong alkaline values, ClO3 is produced,
which is a more stable form of radical, thus limiting the procedure. Consequently, chlorides
are decreased in acidic conditions throughout the electrolysis progression, creating ClO 2,
whereas the formation of chlorates is favored in highly alkaline conditions by the chlorides.
Pharmaceuticals, as well as antibiotics (such as ciproÔ¨Çoxacin amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole,
tetracycline and erythromycin), betablockers (such as nadolol, bisoprolol and atenolol),
non-steroidal anti-inÔ¨Çammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin),
neuroleptics (such as Ô¨Çuphenazine, clozapine and chlorpromazine), estrogens (such as
nilestriol, progynova and diethylstilbestrol), and lipid regulators (such as olbemox, lovas-
tatin and simvastatin) have commonly been identiÔ¨Åed in various water samples due to their
decomposition in human and animals bodies [ 67,68]. For example, many antibiotics have
been identiÔ¨Åed in different water bodies, including surface water, urban sewage, hospital
sewage, etc., with concentrations ranging from several nanograms to several micrograms
per liter. Zhang et al. considered electrochemical anoxic oxidation to be one of the most
suitable processes to remove pharmaceuticals through the mechanism of electron transfer
and reactive species oxidation [ 69]. For example, ibuprofen was entirely removed through
electrochemical anoxic oxidation with a Ti/Pt/PbO 2anode in 60 min, with COD and TOC
values from 60% to 95% and 48% to 92%, respectively [70].
5. Ozone-Based (O 3) Processes
Involving O 3in aqueous reactions may produce various unwanted byproducts due
to its high redox potential. The two pathways that may occur are direct and indirect
reactions, with the former being preferable. The two different half-reactions that may occur
in water are:
O3+2H++2e !O2+H2O
O3+H2O+e !O2+2HO (18)
Usually, ozone is utilized to break C=C bonds in organic compounds. In its indirect
reactions, it creates different radicals depending on the pH values.

HO 4radicals ultimately produce more HO 2radicals, creating OH radicals for the
AOP [ 18]. The most signiÔ¨Åcant problem with such systems is the control of ozone byprod-
ucts such as bromate and N-nitrosodimethylamine, which are both carcinogenic. These also
raise issues in the biological stability of the outcomes of the AOP , because acids, aldehydes
and degradable organic compounds are produced [ 72]. Two major categorizations are in-
cluded in these O 3-based processes: ozone/hydrogen peroxide and ozone/UV . The former
is favored in general wastewater treatments because the production of hydroxyl radicals
is enhanced through the dissociation of H 2O2[71,73], whereas in the latter, UV radiation
photolyzes O 3to the production of H 2O2; in turn, this product produces the necessary OH
radicals [40], as expressed below:
O3+H2O+hv!H2O2
H2O2+hv!2OH(22)
Ozone/hydrogen peroxide has been already implicated in the pharmaceutical sector,
as stated by Almomani et al. [ 74]. The oxidation of various antibiotics, estrogens, etc.,
has been monitored, and the parameters for higher yields are mainly the concentrations,
directly increasing the rates of the oxidation reactions. A fully controlled double-sided glass
reactor was operated in semi batch modes, with proper mass Ô¨Çow controllers, washing
traps, a diffuser, and pH and temperature controls. An efÔ¨Çuent-rich ozone/hydrogen
peroxide catalyst was also tested for anticancer, antipsychotic and painkiller drugs. A COD
reduction was achieved, reaching 88% in a pH range of 4~6. A custom-made assembly with
a glass reactor supported by ozone and oxygen generator systems with controllable Ô¨Çows
was used for the experiments, with 200 mL of wastewater in each batch run [ 75]. Finally,
lake water and wastewater samples were treated with ozone/hydrogen peroxide AOPs, in
a batch reactor of 500 mL at pH = 8, resulting in the increased transformation of atrazine
(ATR), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and N-nitroso-dimethylamine (NDMA), whilst keeping
the bromate formation at a percentage of 70% [31].
Ozone-based processes produce the strongest oxidants in large quantities due to the
O3splitting reaction. Byproducts are more biologically stable but lead to the formation
of aldehydes such as formaldehyde, which is a genotoxic compound. Although it has a
powerful oxidation capability, there are some drawbacks to its use in aqueous reactions,
due to its low solubility in water. The mass transfer of gas‚Äìliquid interfaces and self-
decomposition are the limiting steps for water puriÔ¨Åcation systems. Generally, this AOP is
used as a pretreatment step in wastewater treatment, with no suggestions in major water
puriÔ¨Åcation procedures [28,68,69,71].
6. Photocatalysis
Semiconductor materials, upon exposure to ultraviolet or visible radiation, can pro-
vide surface-activated regions on which redox reaction occur, exploiting the formation of
electrons and holes on their lattice. This procedure is called photocatalysis, and usually,
products of the redox cycle produce HOand O 
2radicals [ 76,77]. The dual nature of this
process involves the ability to excite the semiconductor materials and alter the physical
state of the reactants at a signiÔ¨Åcant rate. Band theory explains the ways of quantifying
this ability in terms of band-gap energy (E g). The moment that semiconductor materials
are exposed to light or UV irradiation, the photonic energy emitted from the radiation isChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 9 of 22
absorbed from an electron in the valence band, creating an electron hole and leading to its
excitation to the conduction band. Figure 4 depicts a typically illustrated mechanism of
pollutants via photocatalysis on TiO 2, according to valence bond theory (VBT).

flows was used for the experiments, with 200 mL of wastewater in each batch run [75].

Ozone-based processes produce the strongest oxidants in large quantities due to the 
O3 splitting reaction. Byproducts are more biologically stable but lead to the formation of 
aldehydes such as formaldehyde, which is a genotoxic compound. Although it has a pow-
erful oxidation capability, there are some draw backs to its use in aqueous reactions, due 
to its low solubility in water. The mass tran sfer of gas‚Äìliquid interfaces and self-decom-
position are the limiting steps for water purifi cation systems. Generally, this AOP is used 
as a pretreatment step in wastewater treatmen t, with no suggestion s in major water puri-
fication procedures [28,68,69,71]. 
6. Photocatalysis 
Semiconductor materials, upon exposure to ultraviolet or visible radiation, can pro-
vide surface-activated regions on which redox reaction occur, exploiting the formation of 
electrons and holes on their lattice. This pr ocedure is called photoc atalysis, and usually, 
products of the redox cycle produce HO‚Ä¢ and O‡¨∂‚Ä¢‡¨ø radicals [76,77]. The dual nature of 
this process involves the ability to excite the semiconductor materials and alter the phys-
ical state of the reactants at a significant rate. Band theory explains the ways of quantifying this ability in terms of band-gap energy (E
g). The moment that semiconductor materials 
are exposed to light or UV irradiation, the photonic energy emitted from the radiation is 
absorbed from an electron in the valence band, creating an electron hole and leading to its 
excitation to the conduction band. Figure 4 depicts a typically illustrated mechanism of 
pollutants via photocatalysis on TiO 2, according to valence bond theory (VBT).

In general, metal oxides are the widest ranging applications for these AOPs, with 
TiO 2, zinc oxide and other binary metal oxides  being the most abundantly used [79‚Äì81].

The categorization of different semiconductors according to their bandgap is reported in
Table 1.
In lowering the bandgap of photocatalysts, less energy is demanded to initiate the
photo-oxidation process; thus, lower irradiation energy is needed. All photocatalysts
operate in the UV region, although considerable effort has been made to extend the pho-
toinitiation to under visible light [ 82‚Äì84]. Doping with metals or non-metals in order
to modify the existing energy bandgap has abundantly been investigated in the litera-
ture [84‚Äì87] . Due to the stability, low cost and non-toxicity of photocatalytic TiO 2, its
use is abundant in pollutant removal [ 88]. Hunge Y.M. et al. compared pharmaceutical
drug removal from waste with Fenton [ 89], photo-Fenton [ 90], TiO 2photocatalysis [ 91]
and ZnO photocatalysis [ 92] oxidation processes. Of these, the ZnO UV-assisted process
proved inefÔ¨Åcient in terms of pollutant degradation. Daneshvar et al. reported the latter
method to be a plausible substitute for TiO 2photocatalysis due to similar photocatalytic
mechanisms [93].
Xiang Li et al. used 50 mL glass beakers under 500 W of UV radiation at a 420 nm
wavelength with TiO 2, trying to resolve the major arsenic contamination problem for global
public health [ 95,96]. This issue had been addressed through different approaches such as
UV/Fe(III)-complexes [ 97], Fe(II)/H 2O2and TiO 2photocatalysis [ 98]. TiO 2photocatalysis
had proven to be a promising method for arsenic-contaminated water through oxidizing
As(III) to the less toxic and less mobile form, As(V) [ 95]. Another issue that arises is that
TiO 2is not able to directly absorb visible light. The technique which may be used for the
decomposition of environmental pollutants under solar radiation is through dye-sensitized
photocatalytic oxidation (SPCO) over a TiO 2catalyst [ 99]. All the above experiments require
inexpensive setups: mainly in glass and/or Duran beakers, under stirring, and radiated
under UV lamps emitting in UVA ranges at a maximum power of 500 W.ChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 10 of 22

Stepnowski P . et al. [ 100] reported the degradation of imidazolium ionic liquids using
the UV photolysis of ionic liquids. In this investigation, 100 mL of liquid was used in a
closed reaction cell, with a Degussa P25 load as the catalyst with a 1000 W xenon arc lamp.
The H 2O2/UV system was found to be the most effective regarding the degradation of all
the compounds. After 360 min of the experiment, approximately 23% of both ionic liquids
was mineralized. A rapid degradation rate was observed for methyl imidazole, for which
degradation was complete after 180 min [100,101].
Generally, photocatalysis is used in wastewater treatment, utilizing the surface of the
catalyst in order to most efÔ¨Åciently decontaminate the pollutants. It is the most used AOP
for water pollutant degradation because it has low operational costs. Despite its vast uses
in many Ô¨Åelds, photocatalysis is the most efÔ¨Åcient and environmentally friendly technique
compared with the other AOPs. The remediation of wastewater through this AOP is
especially prominent, and yields byproducts with low pollutant loads in the environment.
The efÔ¨Åciency of the procedures is mainly attributed to the catalysts used and in the
power of the radiation. As in all UV processes, light emission clearly has a dual role: as a
disinfectant and power source of catalysis initiation. Limitations are due to: (i) the improper
selection of catalysts, which leads to higher bandgap energies, not suitable for maximum
catalytic efÔ¨Åciency because the production of hydroxyl radicals ( OH) is suppressed; and
(ii) the radiation wavelength [74,76,78,88,92].
7. Sonolysis (Ultrasound (US) Radiation)
Sonochemistry is ‚Äúgreen‚Äù branch chemistry that uses ultrasounds either to promote or
modify chemicals reactions. Compared with different sources of energy input into the reac-
tion, ultrasonic treatment can induce a wide range of chemical and physical consequences in
a non-equilibrium state, applicable for the synthesis and modiÔ¨Åcation of materials, leading
to non-equilibrated physicochemical characteristics, catalytic activity, surface morphology
and shape. Ultrasound has frequencies ranging from 20 kHz to 1 GHz. Low-frequency
treatment (power ultrasound, up to 100‚Äì200 kHz) is used to perform sonochemical pro-
cesses and ultrasonic cleaning, whereas high-frequency ultrasound is most commonly used
for medical diagnostics, detection, and the monitoring of processes, e.g., Ô¨Çuid transport.
Generally, ultrasound exceeds the vibrational wavelengths on molecular and atomic scales;
thus, it does not react with molecules. It creates cavitation phenomena in which bubbles
are quickly formed, explode, and collapse inside a liquid medium, producing high energyChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 11 of 22
conversions to chemical energy [ 102,103]. The liquid medium undergoes an expansion
step (rarefaction), a compression step during the compression phase of the sound Ô¨Åeld,
and Ô¨Ånally, the collapse of the formed bubble. The Ô¨Årst two steps occur in cycles, and
during cavitation phenomena, thermal transport and local hotspots are negligible. This
explains the minimal temperature increase in the liquid medium. The critical diameter
of the collapsing bubble is dependent on the frequency of the ultrasound and the liquid
medium. The localized high temperatures and pressures provide conditions for alternative
chemical reaction conditions with high product yields [102,104,105].
More speciÔ¨Åcally, three phases/zones have been recognized in sonocatalytic reactions.
The internal conditions of bubbles have temperatures and pressures of approximately
5000C and 1000 atm, respectively, comprising an initial zone with high heating and
cooling rates. The second zone consists of a gas/liquid transition region surrounding the
bubble. In this zone, temperature reaches a value of ~1900C, and this phase has a width
of 200 nm and usually consists of nonvolatile compounds. The third phase is the bulk
liquid phase, where shockwaves, jets, shear forces, as well as temperature and pressure,
can be kept at normal values, producing free radicals. Hydrophilic chemicals are driven
in bulk, while hydrophobic chemicals remain in the boundary/interface zone. Volatile
chemicals are incorporated into the bubble via evaporation [ 106,107]. According to the
nature of the chemical/pollutant, hydrophilic compounds are treated with OH radicals in
the bulk region; hydrophobic non-volatiles are degraded in the interface, whereas volatile
pollutants are thermally treated inside the bubble [ 104]. A simple illustrated aspect of this
is depicted in Figure 5 for the butyric acid (BA), before (Figure 5a) and after bubble collapse
during sonolysis (Figure 5b).
The degradation of molecules via the formation, growth and collapse of a bubble in a
liquid based on acoustic cavitation is called sonolysis. A bubble‚Äôs collapse can occur within
a few nanoseconds, reaching high temperature and pressure: up to 5000 K and 500 atm,
respectively. Under these conditions, water molecules in the form of gas from the bubbles
can produce hydroxyl radicals (H 2O!OH + H). Sonolysis is an advanced oxidation
process commonly used for wastewater treatments [ 108]. It is a successful and highly
efÔ¨Åcient method; therefore, ultrasound reactors are Ô¨Ånding more and more applications on
an industrial scale [22,109].

As mentioned above, US irradiation has gained considerable interest from the scientiÔ¨Åc
community; therefore, commercial US reactors have been used in various cases of waste
treatment, such as the puriÔ¨Åcation of water from various pharmaceuticals or dyes, and
some researchers have even developed cavitation devices. Saharan et al. [ 113] optimized
three different cavitation devices, with single-hole oriÔ¨Åce plates, circular and a slit venturi,
for the degradation of Orange-D dye. They found that the geometry of the cavitation device
affects the cavitation event. The dimensions and parameters of the ultrasound devices
were inspired by Bashir et al. [ 114]. Madhavan et al. [ 115] have demonstrated the favorable
sonolytic degradation of Orange-D in a relatively acidic environment, close to pH 6 under
213 kHz at a 35% power amplitude from an ELAC LVG-60 RF generator. Many factors, such
as the intensity and frequency of the ultrasound, the geometry of reactors, bulk temperature
and the water matrix may affect the process efÔ¨Åciency. The most important, however, seems
to be the presence of dissolved gases [5].
Pharmaceuticals, which are frequently detected in water, have drawn interest because
they cannot biodegrade and persist and remain toxic [ 116]. They are considered emerg-
ing contaminants with potential environmental and health risks. Researchers have used
different AOPs for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater in everyday life [ 117]. De
Bel et al. [ 118] degraded ciproÔ¨Çoxacin from deionized water at 544 kHz. Naddeo et al. [ 119]
achieved the degradation of diclofenac and carbamazepine from urban wastewater fol-
lowing Ô¨Årst-order kinetics. Lianou et al. [ 120] degraded piroxicam from ultrapure water
using different power densities. Ziylan-Yavas et al. [ 121] succeeded in the degradation of
ibuprofen from ultrapure water with the application of various single ultrasonic frequen-
cies. Serna et al. [ 122] degraded oxacillin from distilled water at 275 kHz. Guyer et al. [ 123]
achieved the degradation of diclofenac from Milli-Q water at 861 kHz. The organology of
the above experiments involved horn-type digital soniÔ¨Åers at Ô¨Åxed frequencies of 20 kHz
to 600 MHz at maximum power outputs of 500 W. Ultrasonic horns with titanium tips 1 cm
in diameter were positioned with their ends 3 cm from the bottom of the rounded glass
Ô¨Çasks. All the Ô¨Çasks were cooled in order to avoid temperature-affected phenomena.
Organic pollutants can be degraded via sonolysis. According to the work of Wang et al.,
there are two pathways to do it. The Ô¨Årst method is using a cavitation bubble produced
by ultrasound with high pressure and high temperature, and the second method employs
reactive species which are produced due to molecular water decomposition from ultra-
sound [ 124]. The application of ultrasound in order to activate persulphate has drawn the
interest of researchers because the cavitation bubbles can activate the efÔ¨Åciency of the persul-
phate [ 125]. Wei et al. [ 126] reported that ultrasonic irradiation activated persulphate for the
degradation of carbamazepine, dioxines, trichloroethane and bisphenol A, both with and
without thermal activation. The elimination of ibuprofen in water has been well addressed
in the sequential use of ultrasonic frequencies, as reported by Ziylian-Yavas et al. [121].
In sonolysis, the production of hydroxyl radicals ( OH) is mostly favored due to
the extreme conditions of the energy input for the procedure. These extreme conditions,ChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 13 of 22
although short-lasting, are sufÔ¨Åcient for producing large quantities of OH, which promote
the degradation of pollutants in water. This AOP is gaining favor, in comparison with
the others mentioned above, due to the lack of reagents, ease of use and selectiveness of
parameter setting according to the pollutant nature. The power consumption of the process
is signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than all the others, and the major disadvantages are the insufÔ¨Åcient
research on parameter selection on the different kinds of pollutants and their concentrations,
and the elevated economical costs during operation [100,102,107,112].
8. Single and Combined AOPs
In real water matrices, the energy requirements are strongly associated with the
nature of the contaminant. Regarding the removal of a pollutant, a comparison table
(Table 2) is presented depicting the possible concentrations of water puriÔ¨Åcation for the
abovementioned AOPs and the total degradation percentages of heavy wastewater, such as
leachates, and low-concentration pollutants such as antibiotics.

In order to depict the use of AOP towards most signiÔ¨Åcant polluted wastewaters,
Table 2 is representative regarding the efÔ¨Åciency of the degradation in similar cases. For
leachate treatment, ozone-based and photo-Fenton processes are more effective than Fenton
processes. The use of such AOPs is induced due to the major advantages reported in each
case. In the case of the leachate, due to the mixed nature of the waste (aqueous, oil-
based, etc.), photo-Fenton performed more efÔ¨Åciently than ozone-based Fenton processes,
although it exceeded the time parameters. Nevertheless, for heavily contaminated leachates,
combined photo- and ozone-based Fenton techniques should be more favored over single
Fenton processes.
In the case of antibiotics, their low concentrations in water are not favorably de-
graded by photocatalytic AOPs. In addition, although it seems that degradation only
using low-frequency ultrasound irradiation is insufÔ¨Åcient, sometimes, the combination
of ultrasound with other AOPs has better effects in terms of COD reduction and waste
degradation. Combined energy inputs overcome the obstacles of the byproducts of each
AOP separately [ 128]. It is proven that only ultrasound did not affect the degradation of a
pharmaceutical pollutant. Naddeo et al. [ 131] coupled ultrasound and Fenton reactions to
enhance the degradation of diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine from distilled
water in single and mixed solutions. Additionally, Adityosulindro et al. [ 128] combined
Fenton reactions and high-frequency (862 kHz) ultrasound, and succeeded in degrading
ibuprofen from distilled water and wastewater, even achieving rates of 100%.
The feasibility of combined Fenton techniques was also suggested by Elmola et al. [ 47],
in cases of the treatment of antibiotics. The combination suggests that AOP may be used in
tandem with sequencing batch reactor (SBR) methods. In addition, Tokomura et al. [ 134]
combined a wide range of AOPs for the removal of certain pharmaceuticals. In the textile
industry, the synergistic effect of sonolysis and photocatalysis throughout Fenton processes
surpasses the energy barriers of the decolorization of complex azodyes systems [ 135].
Even in the cases of azoic dyes, the use of different AOPs suggests a more synergistic
combination of the techniques [ 136]. In cases of heavy pollution and municipal wastewater
treatment [ 137‚Äì140], Amr et al. [ 127] stabilized municipal leachate with ozonation combined
with Fenton processes, reducing the treatment period and yielding a sufÔ¨Åcient value of
COD removal (0.63 kg/kg COD). Organic pollutants such as organosulfur, nitro derivatives
of benzene, BTEX and phenol were subjected to 100% oxidation in the combined use
of sonolysis with ozone/hydrogen peroxide AOP [ 141]. Additionally, the viability of a
multi-barrier treatment through combined H 2O2/UVC techniques allowed the reuse of
wastewater after eliminating selective contaminants [ 36]. The use of AOP versus physical
or chemical processes is favored mainly because most contaminants present in wastewater
are found to be recalcitrant to the physical/chemical treatment process.
Figure 6 presents an overview of the mechanisms of the aforementioned AOPs.
ChemEngineering 2022 , 6, x 15 of 24 
 
although it exceeded the time parameters. Nevertheless, for heavily contaminated leacha-
tes, combined photo- and ozone-based Fenton  techniques should be more favored over 
single Fenton processes. 
In the case of antibiotics, their low conc entrations in water are not favorably de-
graded by photocatalytic AOPs. In addition, although it seems that degradation only us-
ing low-frequency ultrasound irradiation is insufficient, sometimes, the combination of 
ultrasound with other AOPs has better effects in terms of COD reduction and waste deg-
radation. Combined energy inputs overcome th e obstacles of the byproducts of each AOP 
separately [128]. It is proven that only ultrasound did not affect the degradation of a phar-
maceutical pollutant. Naddeo et al. [131] co upled ultrasound and Fenton reactions to en-
hance the degradation of diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine from distilled water in single and mixed solutions. Additionally, Adityosulindro et al. [128] combined 
Fenton reactions and high-frequency (862 kH z) ultrasound, and succeeded in degrading 
ibuprofen from distilled water and wast ewater, even achieving rates of 100%. 
The feasibility of combined Fenton techniqu es was also suggested by Elmola et al. 
[47], in cases of the treatment of antibiotic s. The combination suggests that AOP may be 
used in tandem with sequencing batch reacto r (SBR) methods. In addition, Tokomura et 
al. [134] combined a wide range of AOPs for the removal of certain pharmaceuticals. In 
the textile industry, the synergistic effect of  sonolysis and photocatalysis throughout Fen-
ton processes surpasses the energy barriers of the decolorization of complex azodyes sys-
tems [135]. Even in the cases of azoic dyes , the use of different AOPs suggests a more 
synergistic combination of the techniques [136 ]. In cases of heavy pollution and municipal 
wastewater treatment [137‚Äì140], Amr et al. [127] stabilized municipal leachate with ozo-
nation combined with Fenton processes, re ducing the treatment period and yielding a 
sufficient value of COD removal (0.63 kg/kg COD). Organic pollutants such as organosul-
fur, nitro derivatives of benzene, BTEX and phenol were subjected to 100% oxidation in 
the combined use of sonolysis with ozone/hy drogen peroxide AOP [141]. Additionally, 
the viability of a multi-barrier treatment through combined H
2O2/UVC techniques al-
lowed the reuse of wastewater after eliminat ing selective contaminants [36]. The use of 
AOP versus physical or chemical processes is favored mainly because most contaminants 
present in wastewater are found to be recalc itrant to the physical/chemical treatment pro-
cess. 
Figure 6 presents an overview of the mechanisms of the aforementioned AOPs.

In every AOP , the production of free and strong OH radicals is achieved through
different sources of power and materials. Firstly, in UV peroxide AOPs, the power from
UV radiation is capable of producing the necessary OH radicals. In contrast to Fenton
processes, the addition of Fe3+/Fe2+ions with H 2O2(Fenton reagent) produces highly
active Fe2+/Fe3+ions, respectively, with OH radicals providing the necessary catalytic
system to properly treat speciÔ¨Åc wastewater. In electro-Fenton reactions, the process utilizes
electrical energy to split the water molecule into OH free radicals with the simultaneous
presence of Fe ions. Ozone-based processes use photons (hv) to initiate the production
of hydrogen peroxide which, in turn, produces OH radicals. In photocatalysis, a metal-
oxide catalyst is used, which utilizes the UV/Vis radiation to create electron hole pairs for
the generation of OH free radicals. Ultimately, energy from the ultrasound (sonolysis) is
efÔ¨Åcient for the rapid production of H and OH radicals with high yield.
In Table 3, the main advantages and disadvantages of each AOP are presented.

9. Conclusions
AOPs have been fully implemented in wastewater treatment, the pharmaceutical
industry, textiles, and at the general circular economy scale globally. Categorization of the
processes and applications mentioned in the research can be used to evaluate the effect
of each AOP separately, as well as in combination. Single AOPs may be used to purify
and treat waste and wastewater at very efÔ¨Åcient rates; however, combinations of AOPs
have been implemented in many cases, with prominent results. This review represents
a guide useful for rapidly assessing the drawbacks and limitations of each AOP in the
prospect of potential uses in wastewater treatments. Major advantages and disadvantages
of each process are presented, focusing on the operation costs, reaction rates and formationChemEngineering 2022 ,6, 8 16 of 22
of byproducts. Major limitations are the concentrations of wastewater efÔ¨Çuents and the
up-scalability of the aforementioned AOPs. The equipment required is inexpensive because
it consists of custom-made vessels and glass apparatus. Especially for the treatment of
wastewater contaminated by antibiotics, Fenton-based and UV processes seem to favor
degradation of the efÔ¨Çuent streams. Nevertheless, the combined efÔ¨Åciency of AOPs holds
the key to a more rational, cost-effective, ‚Äúgreen‚Äù process of handling global pollution and
contaminant problems. The efÔ¨Åcient removal of vital parameters in each case will create
the necessary global database and shed light on global pollution solutions.
