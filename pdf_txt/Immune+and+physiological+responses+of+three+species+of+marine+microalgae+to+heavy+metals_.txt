Abstract Effects of zinc on growth, cell morphology,
oxidative stress responses and zinc removal activity of two
common phytoplankton species, Monoraphidium pusillum
(Printz) Koma ´rkova ´-Legnerova ´and Monoraphidium grif-
ﬁthii (Berkeley) Koma ´rkova ´-Legnerova ´were investigated
at a concentration range of 0.2–160 mg l-1zinc. Cell
densities and chlorophyll content decreased compared with
controls in cultures of both species, effective concentra-
tions causing 50 % growth inhibition within 72 h on the
basis of cell numbers were 33.69 and 25.63 mg l-1zinc for
M. pusillum andM. grifﬁthii , respectively. Changes in cell
morphology and elevated lipid peroxidation levels
appeared in zinc-treated cultures of both species, but only
at higher ( [10 mg l-1) zinc concentrations. The most
effective zinc removal appeared at 20 and 10 mg l-1zinc
concentration for M. pusillum and M. grifﬁthii , respec-
tively. Removed zinc is mainly bound on the cell surface in
the case of both species. This study provides new data for
the zinc tolerance and zinc removal ability of the green
algae M. pusillum andM. grifﬁthii and shows that green
algal species common in surface waters could have zinc
tolerance and zinc-binding abilities, which makes them
feasible in treatment of waters contaminated with
10–20 mg l-1zinc.Keywords Common green algal species /C1Zinc /C1Growth

Introduction
It is well known that the presence of heavy metals in
aquatic environments causes serious damage to aquatic life.
These metals can reduce the effectiveness of puriﬁcation
processes during biological treatment of wastewater by
damaging microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, protozoa). Lots
of metal salts are soluble in water and consequently cannot
be separated by physical separation (Hussein et al. 2004 ).
Physico-chemical methods, such as evaporative recovery,
chemical oxidation or reduction, chemical precipitation
and ﬁltration, electrochemical treatment, ion exchange, or
membrane technologies have been widely used to remove
heavy metal ions from wastewater. The main problem of
these processes is that they may be ineffective and/or rather
expensive, when the concentration of dissolved metal ions
is lower than 100 mg l-1(Volesky 1990a ,b). Biological
methods for the removal of metal ions may provide an
attractive and cost-effective alternative to physico-chemi-
cal methods (Kapoor and Viraraghavan 1995 ), since many
microorganisms are able to remove metal ions from aquatic
solutions by metabolically active (bioaccumulation) and/or
passive (biosorption) processes (Chojnacka 2010 ).
Algae are in the focus of scientiﬁc interest because of
their mass productions (blooms) and possible toxic prop-
erties (Perovic et al. 2000 ; Vasas et al. 2012 ; Zhang et al.
2012 ). Algae play more and more important roles in a wide
range of economical and environmental issues in the last
few years, obviously they are also involved in wastewater
treatment and sequestering of toxic, essential or precious

Provided by Repository of the Academy's Librarymetals (Munoz and Guieysse 2006 ; de Bashan and Bashan
2010 ; Das 2010 ). Algal cell wall has a key role in metal
removal, especially in biosorption processes, which are
also important in metal binding of living biomass. Cell wallof green algae (Chlorophyta) is composed mainly from
cellulose, and a high percentage of the cell wall is struc-
tured from glycoproteins, proteins bound to polysaccha-rides (Romera et al. 2006 ). Over the metal-binding
capability of cell wall, microalgae and some fungi are able
to produce peptides capable to bind heavy metals. These
molecules, as organometallic complexes, are further par-
titioned inside vacuoles. They facilitate the control of thecytoplasmic concentration of heavy metal ions, thus pre-
venting or neutralizing the potential toxic effects (Cobbett
and Goldsbrough 2002 ). It is difﬁcult to decide whether
algal biomass is better or not than others (bacterial or
fungal). The results of various studies are not easy to
compare directly due to the different data presentation ofvarious authors’ (Wang and Chen 2009 ). Nevertheless,
study of photosynthetic organisms is justiﬁable, because
there are generally accepted procedures in wastewatertreatment technology, in which the presence of these
organisms can be considered, or easy to implement (Pe-
rales-Vela et al. 2006 ).
Over the well-studied aspects of toxic heavy metals
(Cr; Cd; Pb), effects of trace elements (Fe; Cu; Zn) on the
growth of phytoplankton sp ecies still have been in the
focus of interest for a long time. Zinc is an essential trace
element, necessary for living organisms (Sugarman 1983 ;
Broadley et al. 2007 ;P r a s a d 2008 ). Zinc is found in a
great number of speciﬁc enzymes (US NRC 2000), serves
as structural ion in transcription factors and is stored and
transferred in metallothioneins (Cotton et al. 1999 ). Zinc
is known as the second most abundant transition metal
after iron in organisms, and it is the only metal that
appears in all enzyme classes (Broadley et al. 2007 ).
Although zinc is essential, excess of this element can be
toxic. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and
iron absorption (Fosmire 1990 ). Free zinc ion in solution
c a nb eh i g h l yt o x i c( E i s l e r 1993 ) ,a n dm a n yd a t ai nt h e
literature show that just micromolar amounts of the free
ion cause the death of some organisms (Muyssen et al.2006 ). Zinc resistance of microalgae varies within a very
wide range (from several mg l
-1to several hundreds of
mg l-1(Travieso et al. 1999 ; Nishikawa and Tominaga
2001 ;L ie ta l . 2006 ; Monteiro et al. 2009 ,2011a ,b). In
general, it can be said that many microalgae can bind
signiﬁcant amounts of zinc (Brinza et al. 2007 ). The
above-mentioned cell wall p roperties and phytochelatin
production abilities are behind this phenomenon. Simi-
larly to other metals, elevated zinc levels may causemorphological changes or oxidative stress in microor-
ganisms, including algae (Gold et al. 2003 ;M o r i na n dCoste 2006 ;T r i p a t h ia n dG a u r 2006 ;L ie ta l . 2006 ).
Effective concentrations depend on the tolerance/sensi-
tivity of algal species. La boratory studies showed that
zinc pretreatment could enhance the tolerance of algaetoward toxic metals others than zinc (e.g. Cd, Hg, Cu, Pb;
Lehmann et al. 1998 ; Tsuji et al. 2002 ), so zinc-tolerant
species could be good subjects of biosorbent, metallo-
thionein or phytochelatin research (Andrade et al. 2004 ;
Perales-Vela et al. 2006 ). To take these facts into con-
sideration, it is reasonable to study the metal tolerance
and removal ability of inland algal species, which could
have relevant potentia l in water treatment.
Monoraphidium species are applied for several bio-
technological events (Fujii et al. 2009 ; Gattullo et al. 2012 ;
Yang et al. 2012 ; Yu et al. 2012 ). There are a few data
about metal tolerance and metal removal ability of
Monoraphidium species (Hornstrom et al. 1995 ; Palmieria
et al. 2000 ; Takami et al. 2012 ; de Queiroz et al. 2012 ), but
according to our knowledge, there are no data about their
zinc tolerance.
Although the average zinc concentration ranges from 5
to 100 lgl
-1in Hungarian surface waters, zinc is one of
the most abundant metal contaminant in wastewaters in
Hungary. Zinc concentration can be increased in conse-quence of mining or industry (electroplating plants,
pharmaceutical companies, paint factories), moreover
household and trafﬁc activities (Horva ´th and Gruiz 1996 ;
O´dor et al. 1998 ; Bird et al. 2003 ). The aim of this study
was to investigate the effects of zinc on growth, cell
morphology, oxidative stress responses, and zinc removalactivity of phytoplankton species, which are common in
Hungarian surface waters. Green algae Monoraphidium
pusillum and Monoraphidium grifﬁthii were treated with
zinc in a wide concentration range (0.2–160 mg l

get detailed data of the sensitivity and zinc removal
ability, hereby the possible future role of these wide-spread algae of surface waters in bioremediation. Exper-
iments were carried out in 2012–2013, on the Department
of Hydrobiology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen,Hungary.
Materials and methods
Strains, culturing conditions, and experimental designMonoraphidium pusillum (Printz) Koma ´rkova ´-Legnerova ´
(ACCDH-UD0911) and M. grifﬁthii (Berkeley) Koma ´r-
kova´-Legnerova ´(ACCDH-UD1008) are cultured in the
Algal Culture Collection of Department of Hydrobiology,
University of Debrecen (ACCDH-UD). Cultures aremaintained in Jaworski’s medium (pH: 7–7.5), in 250-ml
Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (200 ml culture per ﬂask), bubbled withInt. J. Environ. Sci. Technol.
123sterile air, at 24 /C176C, under continuous irradiation. Treat-
ments were achieved within the same conditions, in
500-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (400 ml culture per ﬂask).
Control cultures contained no added zinc, and ZnSO 4
(Reanal, Hungary) was added to the treated cultures to
reach 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120
and 160 mg l-1zinc concentrations. Negative controls
(medium ?zinc, without algae) were applied for all zinc
concentrations to check the maintenance of the metal
concentration added to the culture medium during the
timeframe of the experiments (7 days). All experiments
were done in triplicates.
Growth of the control and treated cultures was followed
by counting the cell number and measuring the chlorophyll
acontent and dry mass of the cells. Cell numbers were
counted according to the European Standard EN 15204
(2006) using an Olympus BX50 ﬂuorescent microscope at
4009magniﬁcation. Changes in cell morphology were
followed by the same microscope at 1,000 9magniﬁcation,
on days 0, 3 and 7 of the experiments.
For chlorophyll content and dry mass measurements,
6 ml samples were collected daily, centrifuged (5 min,
10,000 rpm, Micro-centrifuge Type-320a), and after
removal of supernatants, pell ets were lyophilized (Christ
Alpha 1–2 LD plus) and weighed (Ohaus AdventurerTM
Pro). Chlorophyll acontents were measured from the
weighed samples applying the methanolic extractionmethod of Felfo ¨ldy ( 1987 ). Spectroquant Pharo 300
spectrophotometer was used fo r the spectrophotometric
measurements.
Measurement of changes in lipid peroxidation
Lipid peroxidation levels were measured in signiﬁcantly
affected, but still considered as living cultures and were
expressed as the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactivesubstances (TBARS), following the method of Verma
and Dubey ( 2003 ). Samples of 6 ml were collected at
days 0 and after 72 h, samples were centrifuged (5 min,10,000 rpm, Micro-centrifuge Type-320a) and after
removal of supernatants, pellets were used for the reac-
tions. Brieﬂy: pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.25 %(w/v) 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in 10 % (w/v) trichlo-
roacetic acid (TCA). Mixtures were incubated at 95 /C176C for
30 min, and then, they were quickly cooled in ice bath andcentrifuged (5 min, 10,000 rpm, Micro-centrifuge Type-
320a). The absorbance of supernatants was measured at
532 and 600 nm (for correction of unspeciﬁc turbidity).TBA solution in TCA served as blank. Amounts of TBARS
were calculated to unit of cell number using the extinction
coefﬁcient of 1.56 910
5M-1cm-1. Results are given in
percentage, and 100 % is the value that was measured in
control culture at the beginning of the treatments.Measurement of the total amount of removed zinc
Zinc contents of the cell-free supernatants were measured
according to the Hungarian Standard MSZ 1484-3:2006 5.
by Atom Absorption Spectrometry (AAS, UNICAM 969with GF90 plus oven transformer and FS90 plus oven
sample tray unit), in the laboratory of Environmental
Protection, Nature Conservation and Water Authority,Trans-Tiszanian Region. Samples of 6 ml from signiﬁ-
cantly affected, but still considered as living cultures, were
collected at days 0, 3, and 7 of the experiments and cen-trifuged (5 min, 10,000 rpm, Micro-centrifuge Type-320a)
and zinc contents of supernatants were measured. Ten-fold
diluted samples of 20 ll were measured, and all mea-
surements were done in triplicate. For calibration, MERCK
ICP IV multielement standard was used. Zinc precipitation
in negative controls (medium ?zinc, without algae) were
measured and calculated by the same way. Amounts of
zinc removed by the cells were calculated based on
decreasing zinc contents of the supernatants, corrected withthe amount of precipitated zinc. Results were given to unit
of dry mass.
Measurement of intracellular level of zinc
Intracellular zinc content was measured according to the
method described by Tripathi and Gaur ( 2006 ). To deﬁne
intracellular zinc content, 6 ml samples from signiﬁcantly
affected, but still considered as living cultures, were col-lected at days 0, 3, and 7 of the experiments. The algal
suspensions were centrifuged (5 min, 10 000 rpm, Micro-
centrifuge Type-320a), and after removal of supernatants,pellets were washed in 5 ml of 2 mM EDTA for 10 min to
remove all of the surface-bound zinc without any effect on
the internal zinc content. After centrifugation, pellets weretransferred to 5 ml of digestion mixture containing HNO
3
(70 %), H 2O2(30 %), and deionised water at a 1:1:3 ratio
(Bates et al. 1982 ). Digestion was performed on a hot plate
at 80 /C176C until the solutions became colorless. The residues
were dissolved in 2 % (v/v) nitric acid and were adjusted to
a ﬁnal volume of 5 ml. The samples were analyzed for zinccontent by AAS.
Statistical analysesOne-way ANCOVA was used to determine the signiﬁ-
cances among the tendency differences of growth curves ofcontrol and treated cultures (Zar 1996 ; Hammer et al.
2001 ). For statistics of morphology changes, oxidative
stress and zinc removal data were subjected to analysis of
variance (two-way ANOVA). Tukey’s test as multiple
comparison procedure was used to show the signiﬁcantdifferences between means at the 5 % level.Int. J. Environ. Sci. Technol.

123Results and discussion
Growth of the culturesBoth in M. pusillum andM. grifﬁthii cultures, 0.25, 0.5, and
1.0 mg l
-1zinc caused slight, but not signiﬁcant increase
in cell number compared with control cultures (Fig. 1a, b).
Zinc concentrations from 1.5 to 10 mg l-1did not cause
signiﬁcant alterations in cell numbers (Fig. 1c, d). Treated
cultures differed signiﬁcantly from control cultures only
from 20 and 10 mg l-1zinc in the case of M. pusillum and
M. grifﬁthii , respectively ( P\0.001; Fig. 1e, f), so the
sensitivity of the two species was different on the basis of
cell number. There were no signiﬁcant differences among
the effects of zinc in concentrations higher than 40 mg l-1
(80, 120 and 160 mg l-1, Fig. 1g, h). Growth of the cul-
tures was strongly inhibited, but it has to be noted that M.
pusillum showed a slight increase in cell numbers even at
the presence of 160 mg l-1zinc.
As it was observed in the case of cell number changes,
M. pusillum was less sensitive to zinc than M. grifﬁthii also
on the basis of chlorophyll acontent. Lower zinc con-
centrations (0.25–5 mg l-1) did not cause signiﬁcant
alterations in chlorophyll acontent of M. pusillum cultures,
but signiﬁcantly lower chlorophyll alevel was measured in
M. grifﬁthii cultures treated with 1.0 mg l-1and higher
zinc concentrations (Fig. 2a–d). While there was detectable
increases in cell numbers at high zinc concentrations,
chlorophyll content remained at low level or decreased at
higher zinc concentrations (from 20 and 10 mg l-1in the
case of M. pusillum andM. grifﬁthii , respectively, Fig. 2e–
h). Table 1summarizes the actual zinc concentrations and
the calculated amount of precipitated zinc in negative
controls (medium ?zinc, without algae) for signiﬁcantly
affected, but still considered as living cultures. Growthcurves and EC
50values showed that inhibition of chloro-
phyll synthesis occurred at lower zinc concentration than
the inhibition of cell division (Figs. 1,2; Table 2).
As far as we know, these are the ﬁrst data about zinc
tolerance of these Monoraphidium species, which can be
characterized as zinc-tolerant ones. Comparison of literarydata with each other and with our results may not be
entirely accurate because of different measured growth
parameters and exposition times, yet it seems that the zinctolerance of the studied Monoraphidium species is in the
‘‘medium range’’ in comparison with the zinc tolerance
of some other green algae. Growth rates of extremelyzinc-tolerant species, such as a Chlorella vulgaris and a
Scenedesmus acutus strain, did not differ from controls in
the presence of 100–300 and 125 mg l
-1zinc, respectively
(Travieso et al. 1999 ). EC 50was 300 mg l-1zinc in the
case of a Chlamydomonas acidophila strain (Nishikawa
and Tominaga 2001 ). On the other hand, there are species
much more sensitive to zinc than the ones in our study.Tripathi and Gaur ( 2006 ) observed that 1.64 mg l
-1zinc
inhibited the growth of a Scenedesmus strain within 48 h.
Zinc concentration of 6.5 mg l-1caused growth inhibition
and oxidative stress in a Pavlova viridis strain (Li et al.
2006 ).
Changes in cell morphology
Morphological changes were followed in signiﬁcantly
affected, but considered as living cultures (from 10 to
40 mg l-1treatments). Zinc treatments caused changes in
cell morphology of both studied species, but the changes
were different. The chloroplasts and later the whole cells of
M. pusillum became fragmented, and the cells precipitated
and sunk to the bottom of the ﬂasks. Linear correlation was
observed between these phenomena and the increasing
concentration of zinc. In the case of M. pusillum, the
number of deformed cells in control and in treated cultures
differed signiﬁcantly from each other in every case
(P\0.001, Fig. 3a). Cell morphology changes of M.
grifﬁthii were barely detectable: M. grifﬁthii cells became
slightly more swollen than in control cultures, ﬂocculation
also occurred. Signiﬁcant differences ( P\0.001) were
among numbers of deformed cells in control and treated
cultures of M. grifﬁthii , but numbers of deformed cells did
not differed signiﬁcantly from each other, only in 30 and40 mg l
-1treatments (Fig. 3b).
Morphology changes of algal taxa as a response to zinc
contamination strongly depend on ecotype of the taxa(Pawlik-Skowronska 2003 ), on the concentration of zinc
and on the time of exposure (Gold et al. 2003 ; Morin and
Coste 2006 ). In sensitive species (e.g., ﬁlamentous green
algae as Stigeoclonium tenue or certain diatoms), these
morphological changes appear at low zinc concentrations
(Pawlik-Skowronska 2003 ; Gold et al. 2003 ; Morin and
Coste 2006 ). It is known that metals able to inhibit normal
cell division due to binding to sulfhydryl groups, which are
important in regulating cell division (Visviki and Rachlin1991 ). In the case of the studied Monoraphidium species,
cell morphology changes appeared only from relatively
high zinc concentration (10 mg l
-1). There was detectable
increase in cell number in M. pusillum cultures treated with
40 mg l-1zinc, this could be the reason of highest abun-
dance of abnormal cells. Increasing mitotic abnormalitiescaused by zinc could be one of the reasons of this phe-
nomenon. Morphological changes seemed not to be highlybFig. 1 Changes of cell numbers in control cultures and in cultures

123speciﬁc or characteristic to zinc treatment in the studied
green algae, contaminants affecting cell division other than
zinc, may cause similar morphological changes.
Changes of lipid peroxidation levels
Oxidative stress responses were followed in signiﬁcantly
affected, but considered as living cultures (from 10 to
40 mg l-1treatments). The amount of TBARS increased in
proportion to the increasing zinc concentration in M. pus-
illum cultures. There were no signiﬁcant differences
between control and 10 mg l-1treatment. The other
treatments differed signiﬁcantly from control, but not from
each other (Fig. 4a). TBARS levels did not differed sig-
niﬁcantly in control and in 10 mg l-1zinc-treated M.
grifﬁthii cultures, but signiﬁcant differences were observed
between control and among the other treatments(P\0.001). The highest TBARS concentration was mea-
sured at 30 mg l
-1zinc treatment (Fig. 4b). 30 and
40 mg l-1initially added zinc caused signiﬁcantly higher
increase in TBARS levels in M. grifﬁthii cultures than in
M. pusillum cultures ( P\0.001). M. grifﬁthii seemed to be
more sensitive from enzymological point of view:30–40 mg l
-1initially added zinc caused 200 % increase
in the amount of TBARS within 72 h comparing to control.
This value is 1.2–1.5-fold higher than that of M. pusillum .
Algae show great diversity in oxidative stress responses
to zinc, as it is indicated by our results and literary data.
There were detectable increasing amount of TBARS in aScenedesmus sp. already from 5 lM zinc ( *0.3 mg l
-1,
Tripathi and Gaur 2004 ). Zinc was observed to cause an
increase in glutathione pools, in particular of glutathionedisulﬁde (GSSG), causing a decrease of its redox ratio, i.e.,
to cause oxidative stress in Enteromorpha species already
from 0.1 to 0.2 mg l
-1(Malea et al. 2006 ). On the other
hand, lipid peroxidation levels in Chlorella pyreonidosa
increased only from 30 lM zinc ( *2m gl-1; Vavilin et al.
1998 ), or from 6.5 mg l-1inP. viridis (Li et al. 2006 ).Green algae used in our study can be regarded as not
sensitive to zinc from oxidative stress aspects, and amount
of TBARS revealing enhanced lipid peroxidation increased
only from relatively high ( C20 mg l-1) zinc concentration.
Removal of zinc
Zinc removal was followed in signiﬁcantly affected, but
considered as living cultures (from 10 to 40 mg l-1treat-
ments). Both species were able to remove notable amount
of zinc by the end of the experiments (Fig. 5; Table 3). In
the case of M. pusillum , zinc removal ability differed sig-
niﬁcantly in the different treatments and at different
exposition times ( P\0.001). The highest removal activity
appeared in the 20 mg l-1zinc-treated cultures on the
7th day, 29.3 mg g-1zinc was removed (Fig. 5a), which
meant 52.8 % of the initial zinc content (Table 3). A sig-
niﬁcant amount of zinc bound quickly at the beginning ofthe experiments in 20, 30 and 40 mg l
-1zinc-treated cul-
tures. There was no signiﬁcant correlation between the zinc
concentration, exposition time, and the amount of removedzinc (Fig. 5a). Removal ability of M. grifﬁthii cells was
different: although signiﬁcant alterations occurred in zinc-
binding activity of M. grifﬁthii in different treated cultures
(P\0.001), the most amount of zinc per unit of dry mass
was bound in the 10 mg l
-1treated cultures, on the 3rd day
(29.7 mg g-1, Fig. 5b). Highest removal capacity as per-
centage of initial zinc content occurred in the same cultures
on the 7th day (84.8 %, Table 3). As it was observed in M.
pusillum cultures, a signiﬁcant amount of zinc bound
quickly at the beginning of the experiments in 20, 30 and
40 mg l-1zinc-treated M. grifﬁthii cultures. The results
show that only a small part of total amount of removed zincbFig. 2 Changes of chlorophyll acontents in control cultures and in

123is intracellular in the case of both species (Fig. 5c, d).
There were no signiﬁcant effects of zinc concentration and
exposition time on intracellular zinc content (Fig. 5c, d).
The results show that removal capacity of M. pusillum
was the highest at 20 mg l-1zinc concentration on the
7th day, while in the case of M. grifﬁthii maximal zinc
removal appeared on the 3rd day in 10 mg l-1treated
culture. This phenomenon is just the opposite of the
observations of Tripathi and Gaur ( 2004 ) or Monteiro et al.
(2011a ,b), they described that the highest zinc massremoval occurred in Scenedesmus cultures exposed to the
highest metal concentration. On the other hand, Omar
(2002 ) also observed a decrease in the amount of bound
zinc at higher concentrations. It seems that there was a
strong primary binding of zinc (at 20–30 mg l-1), followed
by slower secondary binding. This could explain why the
amount of removed zinc increased signiﬁcantly to the 3rd
and 7th days in 20–30 mg l-1zinc-treated Monoraphidium
cultures. The signiﬁcant decrease in zinc biosorption in
40 mg l-1treated cultures may indicate that there is some

123mechanism involved in zinc removal, which modify the
binding sites of the cell wall of vital cells, similarly to
heating or drying processes (Monteiro et al. 2011b ). A
partial disruption of structural components in the cell walls
owing to high zinc concentration is presumable, which
leads to protein denaturation and is thus responsible for the
decrease in number of the functional sites available to
interact with zinc ions (Monteiro et al. 2011b ). Proof of this
hypothesis requires further experiments.
The results show that a larger proportion of removed
zinc is bound by adsorption onto the cell surface in the case
of both studied strains. Only small increases in intracellular
zinc were observed with increasing amounts of zinc in the
culturing media, which is in accordance with the data of
other studies (Hassler et al. 2005 ; Monteiro et al. 2011a ,b).In contrast, in some cases accumulated quantity of metals
could be higher than adsorbed, as for certain C. vulgaris
strains or other bioaccumulators (Nacorda et al. 2007 ).
As in the case of growth, comparison of the literature
data with each other and with our results may not be entirely
accurate because of different measured growth parameters,
exposition times, and different extrapolation of measured
data. It seems that zinc-binding ability of the studied species
is in the ‘‘medium range’’ in comparison with that of some
other green algae, similarly to their zinc tolerance. There are
more capable isolates: Schmitt et al. ( 2001 ) claimed maxi-
mum speciﬁc adsorption capacities of 72.06 mg g-1
forScenedesmus subspicatus (exposed to 0.5 mg l-1zinc
for 4 days), Ahuja et al. ( 2001 ) also reported higher
zinc removal ability for the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria

123angustissima (35.7 and 83.4 mg g-1; exposed to 20 and
30 mg l-1zinc, respectively for after 10 days). High zinc
adsorption was reported for an other O. angustissima strain
and for Microcystis sp. (641.25 and 999.5 mg g-1, respec-
tively; Ahuja et al. 1999 ; Pradhan et al. 1998 ). Otherwise,
the application of these cyanobacteria as biosorbents is
questionable, because of their possible toxic properties(Vasas et al. 2010 ,2013 ). Some species of the family
Scenedesmaceae can be considered as outstanding zinc
binders, 360 and 103 mg g
-1bound zinc were reported for
aDesmodesmus pleimorphus isolate and a laboratory strain,
respectively, (Monteiro et al. 2009 ) and 836,5 mg g-1was
reported for a Scenedesmus oblicuus strain (Monteiro et al.
2011b ). On the other hand, there are strains, which can be
characterized more comparable or even weaker zinc-bind-ing ability, than the ones in our study: Romera et al. ( 2007 )
reported that the ﬁlamentous green alga Spirogyra insignis
removed a maximum of 21.1 mg g
-1of zinc, Pawlik-
Skowron ´ska ( 2003 ) reported 8.1 mg g-1for an other ﬁla-
mentous green alga, Stigeoclonium tenue (exposure to
2m gl-1zinc for 3 weeks). A strain of Scenedesmus
quadricauda removed 5.03 mg g-1zinc after 24 h incu-
bation from solutions ranging from 0.5 to 11 mg l-1(Omar
2002 ), similar amount (5 mg g-1) was reported for Euglena
gracilis (Fukami 1988 ).
The most common arrangements used for the removal of
inorganic contaminants are high-rate algal ponds (HRAP)and the patented algal turf scrubber (ATS), which employs
suspended biomass of common green algae, cyanobacteria
or consortia of both (Perales-Vela et al. 2006 ). Algal spe-
cies, which are common in the environment of the planned
localities of these kinds of ponds, could be more suitable to
inoculate and maintain these systems than species from anentirely different environment. On the basis of the results
presented here, it can be concluded that there are common
green algal species in surface waters, whose tolerance tozinc and zinc-binding ability makes them feasible in treat-
ment of wastewaters with 1–20 mg l
-1zinc contamination.
Conclusion
Based on these results, it can be concluded that the studied
green algal species are zinc tolerant; they are able to sur-
vive relatively high zinc concentrations. This paper pro-vides new data for the zinc tolerance and zinc removalability of the green algae M. pusillum and M. grifﬁthii .
Both species are able to remove signiﬁcant amount of zinc,
and the larger proportion of removed zinc is bound by
adsorption onto the cell surface. Living biomass of thestudied species could be applicable for biosorption,
3–7 days exposition up to 20 mg l
-1zinc concentration at
pH 7–7.5. It can be concluded that living biomass of thestudied strains—common algal species in Hungarian sur-
face waters—as newly introduced metal tolerant species
could be good alternatives for application and/or bases of
future research.
