Marine debris is defined by the National Ocean ic and Atmospheric Ad ministration (NOAA) and 
the United States Coast Guard (USCG) as any pers istent solid material th at is manufactured or 
processed and directly or indire ctly, intentiona lly or unintentionally, disposed of or abandoned 
into the marine environment or the Great Lakes (33 USC 1951 et seq. as amended by Title VI of 
Public Law 112-213). Marine debris  has become one of the most  recognized pollution problems 
in the world’s oceans and waterways today.  
In recent years, research efforts have signifi cantly increased knowledge of  the topic of marine 
debris. However, the field as a whole has not adopted standardized monitoring procedures or 
debris item categories. Standard methodology and reporting is necessary in order to compare 
marine debris source, abundance, distribution, m ovement, and impact data on regional, national, 
and global scales.  
The NOAA Marine Debris Progra m (MDP) has developed standa rdized, statistically valid 
methodologies for conducting rapid assessments of th e debris material type and quantity present 
in a monitored location. The mon itoring guidelines in th is document focus on abundance, types, 
and concentration rather than analyzing by potenti al source, as in many cases it is very difficult 
to connect a debris item to a specific debris-gen erating activity. These techniques are intended to 
be widely applicable to enable comparisons across regional and global scales.  This document includes guidelines for estimating de bris concentrations on shorelines, in surface 
waters, during visual surveys at sea, and in the benthos. Background information is provided for 
each environmental compartment (i.e., shorelines, surface waters, and the se afloor), in addition 
to guidelines for survey design, required equipment, the survey techniques, and study 
implementation considerations. The appendices include a brief literature review for each compartment, survey data sheets, a debris item photo guide, frequently asked questions for 
shoreline surveys, and a summary of work comple ted by Versar, Inc. to test the methodologies.  
The techniques described in this document were develope d over the course of a number of years, 
based on a review of the literature, discussions with experts, and fiel d testing by the MDP and 
contractors. For shoreline monitoring, the MDP benefited from feedback from partner 
organizations who implemented these methods prior to the official  publication of these 
guidelines. 
The guidelines in this document are intended for use by managers, researcher s, citizen scientists, 
and other groups conducting marine debris survey and assessment activities, especially those 
requiring a rapid assessment. Monitoring and asse ssment of marine debris is essential to 
understanding the problem and being able to miti gate, prioritize, and prevent the most severe 
impacts. The effort to develop this docume nt was rooted in the need to standardize 
methodologies and facilitate comparisons across time, space, and environmental compartments. 
These guidelines are provided to the marine debr is community at large in order to guide the 
development of integrated monitoring programs nationwide.  2 
 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
Marine debris, in some form, has been addre ssed by NOAA since the earl y 1980s and officially 
recognized as a problem by the federal governme nt since the passing of the Marine Plastic 
Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA)  in 1987 (Public Law 100-220, Title II). This 
legislation was one of the first to provide research prioritizati on and authorize federal funding for 
marine debris in the United States. The NOAA Mari ne Debris Program (MDP) was initiated as a 
program in 2005 within the National Ocean Serv ice’s Office of Response and Restoration and 
was legally established by the Marine Debris Ac t (33 U.S.C. 1951 et seq., as amended by Title 
VI of Public Law 112-213). The act provides sp ecific mandates to the program including 
mapping, identification, impact assessments, rem oval and prevention activities, research and 
development of alternatives to gear posing th reats to the marine environment, and outreach 
activities.   Standardized marine debris monitoring and assessm ent can be used to evaluate the effectiveness 
of policies to mitigate debris, such as recyc ling incentives or extended producer responsibility 
measures, and provide insight into priority targets for prevention and mitigation (NRC 2008). 
For example, in the Gulf of Alaska, the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Scie nce Center conducted 
shoreline monitoring prior to and following the implementation of the International Convention 
for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ( MARPOL ); results indicated a significant decrease in 
the abundance of derelict fishing gear debr is, in the form of nets from ships ( Maselko and 
Johnson, 2011 ). Similarly, debris monitoring in Wash ington DC and other areas with recently-
enacted policies on single-use shopp ing bags are indicating fewer pl astic bags in rivers and in 
riverine “trash traps” (e.g., Anacostia  Watershed Society, unpublished data). 
 The complicated nature of the distribution of mari ne debris in the environment calls for a clear 
and defined approach to charac terizing and assessing the proble m. Marine debris enters the 
marine environment through many pathways, and th e extensive size of the ocean, patchiness in 
the distribution of debris, and spatial and temporal variability in the drivers of debris add to the 
complex life cycle of marine debris (Ryan et al., 2009, Cole et al., 2011, D oyle et al., 2011). This 
document updates and expands upon marine debr is assessment guidelines developed by the 
NOAA Marine Entanglement Research Program in 1992 (Ribic et al., 1992). The guidelines 
outlined here incorporate modern technologies and sampling equipment and focus on standardization of data and repor ting for a statistically robust analysis which can address all 
types of debris. Guidelines are included for estimating debris concentration on shorelines, in 
surface waters, during visual surveys at sea, a nd in benthic surveys. The shoreline survey 
technique described here is availabl e in a user-friendly version in the NOAA Shoreline Survey 
Field Guide (Opfer et al., 2012).  
 
 
 3 1.1 Objectives and Method Development 
The guidelines in this docum
ent are intended to serve as a basis for nationwide monitoring and 
assessment of marine debris, and were desi gned with four main objectives in mind: 
Estimate the quantity of debris at local and regional levels according to land use or other
correlating parameter
Determine types and concentration of debris present by material category (plastic, metal,
glass, rubber, paper/processed lumber, cloth/fabric, other)
Examine the spatial distributi on and variability of debris
Investigate temporal trends in debris types and concentration
This report includes guidelines for four survey  techniques developed and/or modified by the 
MDP: 
Shoreline techniques: Guidance for assessing debris concentr ation on shoreline segments,
including both macro- (> 2.5 cm) and meso-debris (5 mm–2.5 cm)
Surface water techniques: Guidance for assessing  floating debris concentration, including
macro-debris (>2.5 cm), meso-debris (5mm–2.5cm) and  micro-debris ( ≤ 5 mm in length)
At-sea visual techniques: Guidance for conducti ng ship-based visual  surveys of floating
macro-debris (> 5cm or 2 in)
Benthic techniques: Guidance for evaluati ng debris concentration on the seafloor
The methods detailed in this report take into cons ideration lessons learned from studies listed in 
Section 7.1.  Additionally, shorelin e methods were developed with  input from an established 
advisory group.  The advisory group consisted of established researchers in  the debris monitoring 
field, other federal agencies involved in marine  debris efforts, and internal NOAA MDP staff 
(Section 7.2). 
The techniques for shorelines, surface waters, and at-sea visual surveys we re tested and refined 
by NOAA MDP staff during a pilot project in summer and fall 2009 - 2010 in the Chesapeake 
Bay (Arthur et al., 2011). In 2011, the refined te chniques were used during monthly surveys in 
various tributaries of the nor thern Chesapeake Bay to test  the hypothesis that debris 
concentration is correlated with land-use (Lip piatt et al., 2012). Additionally, rigorous bi-weekly 
shoreline and surface water sampling completed by Versar, Inc. from July through December 
2011 at two sites in the mi d-Atlantic informed statistical consid erations described in Sections 2.0 
and 3.0 of this document. The shoreline techni que was also extensively used and tested by 
regional and local groups along the U.S. west co ast, Alaska, and Hawaii to monitor for the 
arrival of marine debris genera ted by the 2011 Japanese tsunami. 
In 2009, the United Nations Environment Program  (UNEP) published a debris assessment 
framework with the major goal of management a nd integration of debris monitoring activities 
across broad geographic regions (Cheshire et al., 2009). The UNEP framework includes a set of 
survey methods for beach, benthic, and floating debris assessment based on existing techniques 
used in the Oslo and Paris Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the 4 North-East Atlantic  (OSPAR), the Northwest Pacific Action Plan  (NOWPAP), Australian 
Marine Debris Status (AMDS), and the Nationa l Marine Debris Mon itoring Program (NMDMP) 
(Cheshire et al., 2009). The approach taken in this document is modeled after UNEP’s 
framework with a few key differences: NOAA techniques focus on item c ount and concentration 
(in units that count debris items per square meter of shoreline, # items/m2) rather than both count 
and weight information;  NOAA shoreline survey techniques  focus on assessment of debris 
standing-stock rather than fl ux rate (however, the NOAA shorelin e survey can be adapted for 
accumulation surveys, see discussion in section 2.0, below); and the debris classification systems 
vary between the two methods. 
The application of these guideli nes to discrete studies will be most informative when study 
design and site selection addre ss clearly stated objectives. 
1.2 Debris Classification 
Although previously published guid elines have focused on docum
enting the primary source of 
debris (e.g., Sheavly, 2007), the methods desc ribed here emphasize  material type.  
Debris source information is an excellent ed ucational tool, however many debris items are 
difficult to identify as either la nd- vs. sea-based or industrial- vs. consumer-based debris. The 
source of a piece of debris found in the open oc ean cannot necessarily be attributed to the 
manufacturing origin or country of consumption. Even when the debris has markings that can be 
used to identify where it was produced, the exac t point of loss to th e environment is unknown. 
Original sources of floating marine debris in the oceans can be difficult to identify, given the 
persistence and potential for l ong-range transport of lightweight  buoyant materials (Ryan et al., 
2009).This makes it difficult to evaluate controls on the land- or ocean-based sources of marine 
debris. Guidelines in this document take a tier ed approach whereby every piece of debris is 
recorded according to material category and th en by specific item or product (as recommended in 
Ribic et al., 1992). The material  categories included are plastic, metal, glass, rubber, 
paper/processed lumber, cloth/fa bric, and other or non- classifiable debris. There is also the 
allowance of “other” items that are locally impor tant and may not be currently listed on the data 
sheets. Further, these items can be catalogued and tracked in the www.md-map.net  online 
database (see Section 2.6). In this way, these guidelines allow for regional customization of 
important debris items. Information on debris source can be obtained du ring data analysis if 
indicator items are identified (e.g., plastic fishin g floats are assumed to be sea-based debris). 
Furthermore, this approach enables analysis of variability in the composition and quantity of debris over time and space. The NMDMP effort (des cribed in further detail in section 2.0), which 
collected information on specific indicator items, was designed to evaluate debris trends on a 
regional scale and was not suitable  to local-scale assessments of spatial and temporal variability 
in debris types and quantities (Sheavl y, 2007, NRC 2008, Ribic et al., 2010, Sheavly, 2010, 
Ribic et al., 2011, Ribi c et al., 2012).  
The methods described here do not  include debris weight inform ation. Debris weight can be 
challenging to measure and dependent on water cont ent; reporting in units  of debris counts (e.g., 5 #items/m2 of shoreline or #items/m3 of water) provides more reliab le and consistent data and 
techniques that are more accessible to organiza tions that may not have means of accurately 
weighing debris. Other programs that are not meant to be part of a rapi d response technique or 
wish to factor in how physical properties such  as weight, density, and form affect debris 
hydrodynamics and fate, may want  to collect weight data. 
Debris items encountered during these surveys is  differentiated based on size class. Both the 
shoreline and surface water sampling strategies distinguish between large (>30cm) and small 
debris items (<30cm). Large debris items have a larger surface area and th erefore have a greater 
potential to disturb valuable ha bitat. Additionally, large debris items may be less mobile in the 
environment and may be encountered more than  once in reoccurring surveys. Having a record 
and location of these items will limit the potential errors in  duplication. Figure 1, below, 
indicates the debris size ranges samp led by the techniques described here. 
Figure 1.  Size ranges sampled by the techniques suggested in this document. 
1.3 Safety 
Safety should be the number one priority during a ny survey activity. Because this work is carried 
out in the field, there are inherent hazards a ssociated with these techniques. Use caution and 
follow general safety guidelines.  The safety tips below are provided as general guidance, but it is 
imperative that project leads unders tand all risks associated with survey activities, always use 
caution, and conduct an operational ri sk assessment for the specific ma rine debris survey activity 
and location. Operational risk assessments s hould include resources (e.g., equipment, boats, 
communication, support, personal protective equipment), environmental hazards or 
considerations (e.g., remoteness,  surf zones), pers onnel (experience, training, physical and 
mental fitness), weather, and mission complexity.  
Follow the buddy system when conducting shore line surveys and other field operations.
Let someone know where you are and when you expect to return.
Carry a means of communication for emergencie s, for example a cell phone or radio. If
there is no reception use a GPS emergency responder or personal locator beacon.
6 
  Always carry a first aid kit. The kit s hould include an emergency water supply and 
sunscreen, as well as bug spray.  
 Understand the symptoms of heat stress and ac tions to treat it. For more information, see 
the OSHA website ( https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heat stress/heat_illnesses.html ). Make 
sure to carry enough water.  
 Be prepared for the weather and tides. Do not  conduct field operations  in severe weather 
and when tides could impede the surv ey area or block an access route.   
 Wear appropriate clothing. Be sure to wear  close-toed shoes and gloves when handling 
any non-hazardous debris as there may be sharp edges.  
 Be aware of your surroundings and be mindful of trip and fall hazards.  
 While on a vessel, always wear your life j acket and make sure it fits correctly.  
 Large, heavy objects should be left in place. Do  not attempt to lift heavy debris objects as 
they may have additional water weight a nd lifting them could result in injury.  
 If you are conducting surveys in  the United States and you come across a potentially 
hazardous material (e.g., oil or chemical drum s, gas cans, propane tanks), contact local 
authorities (a 911 call), a state emergency resp onse or environmental health agency, and 
the National Response Center at (1-800-424-880 2) to report the item with as much 
information as possible. Do not touch the material or attempt to move it.  
 When in doubt, don’t pick it up! If unsure of an item, do not touch it.  If the item is 
potentially hazardous, report it to  the appropriate authorities.  
 7 2.0 SHORELINE METHODS  
Marine debris m
onitoring on shorelines has become an increasingly common undertaking for 
academic, government, and environmental organizations. Shoreline surveys are usually more 
accessible, inexpensive, and straight-forward than monitoring in other environmental compartments. Often the highest debris concentr ations are found on shorelines, which facilitates 
data analysis and trend assessment. 
In addition to lessons learned fr om the studies listed in Sectio n 7.1 and described below, these 
methods were developed with input from an established advisory group. The advisory group 
consisted of researchers in the debris monitoring field, other federal agencies involved in marine 
debris efforts, and NOAA MDP staff (Section 7.2). Data sheets modified here (Section 7.5) were 
adapted from UNEP and the Intergovernmenta l Oceanographic Commission (UNEP/IOC) debris 
monitoring guidelines (Cheshire et al., 2009). 
2.1 Debris Assessment Methods 
Num
erous marine debris monitoring programs ex ist throughout the world. Most programs have 
unique objectives and employ a variety of re gion-specific methodologies, making across the 
board comparisons of debris estimates difficult (e.g., Barnes et al., 2009).  For shorelines, some 
studies report number (or weight) of debris items per unit length  of shoreline (e.g., Bowman et 
al., 1998, Barnes and Milner, 2005) or strandl ine (e.g., Velander and Mocogoni, 1999) while 
others report number (or weight ) of items per unit area of shor eline (e.g., Acha et al., 2003).  
In addition to the NOAA Marine Entanglement Research Program guidelines mentioned above 
(Ribic et al., 1992), lessons learned from previ ous marine debris monitoring efforts were 
considered during development of these guidelines. One key long-term, large scale monitoring program, the National Marine Debris Monito ring Program (NMDMP), was developed by an 
interagency working group consisting of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, NOAA, National Park Service, and United States Coas t Guard following the ratification of MARPOL 
Annex V and the passage of the MPPRCA. NMDM P was designed to assess the magnitude of 
the marine debris problem in the U.S. and evaluate  any regional or tempor al trends according to 
a statistically valid design and sampling pl an (Escardó-Boomsa et al., 1995). The NMDMP 
study, which consisted of monthly surveys conducte d by trained volunteers at randomly selected 
sites along the U.S. coastline, used indicator it ems to identify the major sources of debris 
(Sheavly, 2007). Monitoring occurred from 1996 to 2006 and an analysis of data from a five year 
time period (2001 – 2006) is provided in Sheavly  (2007). The five year analysis showed no 
statistical change in the prevalence of the indica tor items for the nation as  a whole (regional data 
analyses are found in Ribic et  al. (2010), Ribic et al. (2011), and Ri bic et al. (2012)). 
This NOAA shoreline survey technique is designed  as a rapid, quantitative beach assessment for 
collection of standardized and consistent data  that can be applied to address policy and 
management needs at various spatial scales. The UNEP framework men tioned above (Cheshire 
et al., 2009) provides two different beach survey  techniques – comprehensive and rapid beach 8 assessments. This NOAA shoreline technique is designed to be useable by trained community 
volunteer organizations while simu ltaneously providing data that can be used to address key 
management questions. Table 1 provides a comparison of the two survey techniques.

NOAA standing-stock techniques can be adapted for shoreline cleanup efforts. See Section 2.3, below.
2.2 Standing-stock surveys 
The shorelin
e technique describe d in this document is designed as a standing-stock assessment 
survey. Standing-stock surveys are used to measur e the load or concentr ation of debris at a 
shoreline site over time. Each survey event is a snap shot of the concentration of debris at the site, 
and a series of these snapshots over time pr ovides information on changes in the baseline 
concentration of debris. Know ing the concentration of debris (in units of #items/m2 of shoreline) 
at various shoreline sites is n ecessary in evaluating the cumulative impact and conducting impact 
or risk assessments of debris at  a given site and on a regional scale. In standing-stock surveys, 
the measured debris concentra tion reflects the long-te rm balance between inputs (land and sea 
based) and removal (through export, burial, de gradation, etc.). An understanding of how the 
abundance of debris changes over time facilitates analysis of the drivers of debris deposition 
(e.g., weather, tides, tourism, prevention efforts).  
In order to obtain a valid time-series of debris  concentration, the natura l flux of debris onto and 
off of the shoreline should not be altered by th e survey activity. Integrity of the sample design 
should be maintained by not removing debris fr om the site during standing-stock surveys. If 
debris is removed from the s horeline site during a survey, th e overall abundance of debris may 
be underestimated at subsequent surveys. Excep tions should be considered if an item poses a 
threat to human health or is potentially hazardous. The standing-stock and residence time of marine  debris on a given shoreline will vary with 
characteristics of the debris itself, deposition from  land- and sea-based sources, local climate and 
seasonal weather patterns, and characteristics of the beach itself. Shoreline geomorphology, 
substrate, exposure, and coastal cu rrent patterns are some of the f actors that will affect whether a 
given site tends to accumulate or capture debris. 9 
  
2.3 Accumulation surveys 
 
The shoreline survey technique described here can be modified for accumulation surveys (see 
Opfer et al., 2012). During accumulation surveys, ma rine debris is removed from the shoreline 
site. Accumulation studies require initial removal of all debris fr om the site followed by regular 
surveys to record and remove a ll debris. Because debris is re moved from the site, the data 
collected over time provides an estimate of the flux of debris onto the shoreline (in units of 
#items/m2/time), as opposed to the concentration or standing-stock of debris. Both types of data 
are useful for developing models  of the life cycle and movement of debris among environmental 
compartments. Accumulation survey data indicate the net flux of debris onto the shoreline, and 
assume that the rate of debris accumulation is uniform between sample events. Debris flux data 
can be used to assess changes in at-sea debris loads, but cannot be used to evaluate the debris 
load or cumulative impacts of debris. Compared to standing-stock surveys, accumulation studies require more time and money as they are more t horough, require debris removal, and need to be 
conducted on a more frequent basis. 
  
Accumulation survey frequencies must be identical  for comparison between studies (Ribic et al., 
1992). Shoreline sites may have a re latively rapid debris turnover ra te, so in order to accurately 
estimate debris flux onto a shoreline site it mu st be sampled frequently. There is growing 
evidence that accumulation rates are underestimated  by typical survey frequencies. Eriksson et 
al. (2013) found that daily accumulation rate meas urements (i.e., surveys conducted on a daily 
basis) were an order of magn itude higher than those measured  during monthly surveys, and 
Swanepoel (1995) suggested that daily accumula tion rates were 100-600% higher than weekly 
accumulation rates. Eriksson et al. (2013) further suggested that 12 days of consecutive sampling at a given site may be more informative than  monthly surveys over th e course of one year. 
However, Ryan et al. (2009) argue that longe r intervals between sampling events reduces 
variability in measured accumulation rates.  It is difficult to differentiate  between factors that result in the deposition of debris onto the 
shoreline. Depending on the timing of sampling ev ents (e.g., just prior to or following a storm 
event), the calculated net accumulation rate will likely vary. A debris marking study by Williams 
and Tudor (2001) found that “old” debris can reappear on the shoreline following strong wind 
events. Debris can become buried soon after deposition; in reality, accumulation studies are 
measuring the accumulation rate of visible debris  items (Ribic et al., 1992). Accumulation data 
may also be affected by the lateral influx of debris from adjacent shoreline sites. Thus, 
conducting shoreline surveys may not be a suita ble proxy for estimating debris loads in the 
ocean.  Given these considerations, accumulation studies  may be appropriate based on study objectives. 
For example, accumulation surveys can be used to look for a spike in debris deposition from a major debris-generating event or variations du e to climactic events (e.g., El Niño Southern 
Oscillation; Morishige et al., 2007).  Debris flux measurements  are important to understanding 
the life cycle of marine debris, and accumulati on surveys will provide information on the relative 
abundances of different de bris types. To reduce the impacts of marine debris in critical habitats, 10 
 the benefit of more invasive accumulation surveys (with removal of debris) versus less intrusive 
standing-stock surveys should be considered in these locations. 
  
2.4 Survey Design 
 
Previous studies have shown that varying amount s and types of marine debris accumulate on 
shorelines depending on geographical locati on, oceanographic and meteorological conditions, 
climatological patterns (such as El Niño), and pr oximity to land-based or ocean-based sources 
(Morishige et al., 2007, Sheavly, 2007). To provide a more stat istically relevant dataset, 
monitoring sites should be randomly selected from  appropriate strata (e.g., land use, commercial 
and recreational fishing activitie s, political boundaries or management areas, storm water or 
sewage outfalls). Because there are various fact ors affecting debris deposition on shorelines, 
some studies have not detected significant diffe rences in debris abundances between sites based 
on stratifying parameters. For example, van Cauw enberghe et al. (2013) found that sedimentary 
regime (i.e., accretion versus erosion) and touris m did not account for the debris loads they found 
on Belgian shorelines. Further, Ve rsar, Inc. (2012) did not find di fferences in debris loads based 
on watershed land use.  The amount of sampling necessary to assess debris concentrations within a given region is dependent on the spatial variabil ity in debris concentrations a nd the desired level of detection 
(i.e., in order to detect a smalle r change in debris load, more sa mpling is required). Versar, Inc. 
(2012) used a nested survey design to test the utility of the shoreline and surface water survey 
techniques described here, whic h were developed based on a 100-m length of shoreline. At the 
coarsest level, two regions in the coastal mid-At lantic United States we re selected based on land 
use (urban vs. rural). Within each region, three 10 00-m locations (stretches of shoreline) were 
identified. Locations were required to meet all si te selection criteria ( listed below) and were 
separated by at least 1200 m. Within each location, three 100-m shoreline sites were 
systematically selected and remained fixed for th e duration of the study. Surveys at the site level 
were conducted on a bi-weekly basis for a period of  six months in accord ance with the standing-
stock technique described below. Results of the study indicated that ther e was more variability 
(higher relative standard error)  in debris concentrations amon g sites within a given location 
compared to the variability between locations at th e regional level. This su ggests that in order to 
decrease error in reported debris concentrations ,  shoreline surveys should be designed to assess 
debris at the scale of a 1000-m location (i.e., random selection of tr ansects within a 1000-m 
location).   However, this technique was designed to be widely  applicable, and it is r ecognized that in some 
cases it is not possible to find a suitable 1000-m stretch of shoreline for location-level 
assessment. Further, the European Union / Join t Research Centre Mari ne Strategy Framework 
Directive (MSFD) recommends a study design that includes more than one 100-m site on a given 
stretch of shoreline, or two sections of 50-m on heavily litte red shorelines (MSFD, 2013). The 
technique explained below is based on assessment of debris at one 100-m site, but it should be 
noted that a study that includes more than one  site on a given shoreline will provide more 
statistically powerful results.    11 2.4.1 Site Selection 
An assessment of the im
pact of marine debr is surveys on the local environment should be 
completed prior to commencement of any monito ring activities. In part icular, monitoring should 
not be conducted where there is the potential for impacts to enda ngered or protected species or 
habitats. Organizations wishing to engage in ma rine debris monitoring ac tivities are encouraged 
to contact local land owners or managers and wildlife authorities during the site selection 
process. 
Shoreline survey sites should have the following characteristics: 
Sandy beach or pebble shoreline
Clear, direct, year-round access (or seasonal access depending on physical conditions of
the site)
No breakwaters or jetties that affect local circulation and accumula te or inhibit debris
deposition
A minimum of 100 m in length parallel to th e water  (measured along the waters’ edge)
No regular cleanup activities. Sites do not need to be precluded solely because of annualor semi-annual cleanup events, but activities need to be tracked  and noted in data analysis
These characteristics should be met where possibl e, but should be analyzed on a case-by-case 
basis and modified if appropriate for a particul ar region/location or shor eline type. The minimum 
length of shoreline was selected based on UNEP recommendations for rapid assessment 
(Cheshire et al., 2009). UNEP and MSFD (2013) suggest selecting sh oreline sites that have a low 
to moderate slope (15 – 45º). Shallow tidal mudf lat areas can be very wide at low tide, and 
marine debris is typically not very common in the intertidal. However, low-slope sites may still be appropriate for surveys. 
2.4.2 Sample Frequency 
Biweekly te
sting in the coastal mi d-Atlantic indicated that in mo st instances, individual sampling 
events closely tracked monthly averages (Sect ion 7.3). This finding suggests that sampling once 
every 28 days provides an accurate snapshot of debris concentration for the month. Following on recommendations from the National Marine Debris Monitoring Program (Sheavly, 2007), 
surveys should occur within a three-day window of the scheduled sampling event (i.e., shoreline 
standing-stock surveys should o ccur once every 28 ± 3 days). 
2.5 Equipment 
The following item
s are suggested for s horeline standing-stock assessments: 
Digital camera
Hand-held GPS unit
Extra batteries (suggest rechargeable batteries)
Surveyor’s measuring wheel
Flag markers/stakes12 
  100-foot measuring tape (fiberglass preferred) 
 First aid kit (to include suns creen, bug spray, drinking water) 
 Work gloves 
 Sturdy 12-inch ruler 
 Clipboard for each surveyor 
 Data sheets (printed on waterproof paper) 
 Pencils 
 For meso- and microdebris assessment: 
o 5-mm stainless steel sieve 
o Stainless steel tweezers/forceps 
o 32-ounce (~1 L) amber glass sample bottles with lids 
o Wide-mouth funnel (stainless st eel) to fit glass bottles 
o Plastic bucket 
o Quadrat kit (1 m2) 
o Small folding shovel 
o Waterproof paper for labels 
o Permanent markers  
 
 
2.6 Pre-Survey Shoreline Characterization 
 Before any sampling begins, shoreline characteriza tion should be complete d for each 100 m site.  
Each survey site should be measured and marked for accuracy and repeatability using a 
surveyor’s measuring wheel. This includes record ing GPS coordinates in decimal degree format 
(DDD.DDDD N/W) at the start and end of each  100 m segment (note that locations in the 
southern or western hemisphere s will have negative latitudes or  longitudes). If the shoreline 
width is greater than 6 m, GPS co ordinates at all four corners of  the shoreline section should be 
recorded where possible. Additi onally, a shoreline ID name shoul d be created and used for the 
duration of the study (this name will be used for reference in the www.md-map.net  database
1). 
 
Shoreline characteristics and surr ounding land-use ch aracteristics ( e.g. primary land use, nearest 
town, nearest river, etc.) should also be recorded on the data sh eets prior to survey activity.  
Shoreline characteristics include identification and uniformity of the primary substrate type 
(sand, cobble, etc.), the tidal range  and distance (if applicable), a de scription of the first barrier at 
the back of the shoreline section (dunes, vegetation, etc.), and the as pect of the shor eline. It is 
important to record the distance to outfalls, rivers , and other potential sources of marine debris as 
well as local current patterns which can affect debris deposition. Digita l photographs should be 
taken to document the physical characteristic s of the monitoring site. Unless major changes 
occur to the shoreline, shorelin e characterization only needs to be completed once per site per 
year. As mentioned above, changes in beach mor phology (e.g., as a result of storm activity) may 
result in changes in debris deposition. 
 
                                                 
1 At the time of publication, the NOAA MDP online database for shoreline survey data is housed at www.md-
map.net . The database allows users to create custom debris  items within the existing NOAA datasheet framework 
and facilitates data export and analysis. For information or access to the database, email MD.monitoring@noaa.gov . 13 
 2.7 Shoreline Survey Methodology for Macro-Debris (>2.5 cm) 
 In order to analyze the maximum width of the sh oreline section during a relatively rapid beach 
assessment, sampling should be conducted within thr ee hours of low tide. This constraint is made 
for the following reasons:  
 Basing surveys on tides provides a consistent starting point at the waters’ edge. Wrack 
lines are inadequate reference points as they move and change throughout the year.  
 Some shoreline sites ar e inaccessible at high tide.  
 Low tide heights typically exhibit less vari ability than high tides, which allows for a 
larger window of time to conduct surveys.  
 Surveys conducted just prior to high tide ma y miss debris deposite d on the wrack line at 
high tide.  
 Surveying the entire shoreline (including the in tertidal) at all sites facilitates comparisons 
of debris concentrations across sites. Data is representative of the enti re shoreline site and 
is not biased by a small sample size (Rees and Pond, 1995; Burnham et al., 1985).  
 Low tide provides a simple gauge of area surv eyed. If a survey t eam does not have the 
ability to measure beach width at a given survey, it may be a valid assumption that 
approximately the same area of shoreline is  being surveyed (we highly suggest testing 
this for a given shoreline site prior to accepting this assumption).  
 Before arriving on site, select four numbers fr om the random number table (Section 7.4) to 
eliminate any bias from visual inspection of  the shoreline section. These four numbers 
correspond with four transects of 5 m in length within the shorelin e section that will be sampled 
at this particular su rvey. The number of transects chosen  for each sampling event correspond 
with a 20% coverage of the shoreline section.  Thus, on any sampling day 20 m of the 100 m 
shoreline section is analyzed for debris.    Transects run perpendicular to th e shoreline section from water’ s edge, at the time of sampling, 
to the back of the shoreline (Fig ure 2). The back of the shoreline is defined as the location of the 
first barrier or primary substrate change. Ther e might be a change in substrate within the 
intertidal zone; in this instance the back of the sh oreline should be defined such that it extends to 
at least the high tide wrack line. Further, if ther e is evidence that storm or wave action is pushing 
debris beyond the back of the shoreline, surveyor s may be interested in recording these debris 
items separately (e.g., in Alaska debris is commonly found in the wooded region behind the 
shoreline). In this case, debris beyond the back  barrier is recorded on a second data sheet and 
tracked separately from debris on the shoreline. 
 Upon arrival at the site at low tide, use the su rveyor’s measuring wheel to mark the selected 
transects with flags and record transect GPS c oordinates in decimal degree format. Depending on 
the width of the shoreline section, the coordinate information can be  recorded either at one point 
in the middle of each transect (shoreline width <6  m or < ~19.5 ft) or at both the water’s edge 
and back of each transect (shoreline width >6 m or  ~19.5 ft; Figure 2). This designation is due to 
the error associated with the operation of ha ndheld GPS units. The GPS coordinates of each 
transect are recorded for quality assurance a nd to track any changes of beach morphology over 14 the course of the study. For surveys conducted at  high latitude locations, include information on 
the GPS datum used in the notes section of the da ta sheet. In addition to GPS locations, record 
ancillary data prior to the debris survey, which includes the length of each transect from water’s 
edge to first barrier, the time, season, and date of  last survey, descripti on of recent storm activity, 
current weather conditions, and the number of individuals conducting the transect survey. If 
these characteristics are consistent between trans ects on a given survey event, they only need to 
be recorded on one data sheet. 
Figure 2.   Shoreline section (100 m) displaying perpendicular transects from water’s edge at low tide to the first 
barrier at the back of the shoreline section. Red ci rcles indicate marked GPS coordinates. Shoreline width 
determines location and number of GPS coordinates. Figure not to scale. 
Once ancillary data are recorded, su
rveyors s hould walk each transect tallying debris items 
according to material type and subcategory (see da ta sheets in Section 7.5). Debris items should 
only be recorded if they are at  least 2.5 cm in size on the longest dimension (Figure 3). This 
standard length (approximately the diameter of a typical beverage bottle cap) was chosen to 
ensure that the same size items are counted across  surveys and to maintain consistency in survey 
results. Data on debris < 2.5 cm has limited accu racy due to its small size compared to the 
transect area. In practice, surveyors will inevitably  miss a significant fraction of debris below this 
size cutoff. This size cutoff fo r macro-debris surveys has also been adopted by UNEP (Cheshire 
et al., 2009) and the MSFD (MSFD, 2011, MSFD, 2013) . Recognizing that small items represent 
15 
 an important size fraction of marine debris that may pose an even greater threat  to marine life 
(e.g., through ingestion), this tec hnique suggests the use of subsam pling within transects for the 
assessment of meso- and micro-debris. The challe nges with this approach , given the variability 
in small debris concentrations within a shoreline transect, are discussed below.  
 
 
 
Figure 3.   The minimum debris size to be counted is 2.5 cm. 
 
Large macro-debris items (> 30 cm or about 1 ft) are recorded on a separate section of the debris 
data sheet. Large items should only be recorded in the large items section. Information recorded 
should include the debris type, the status of th e large item (sunken, strande d, or partially buried), 
the latitude and longitude of the item, and the approximate debris size. This information is 
important in determining the foot print of large debris items. 
 Any item that is partially within a transect should be tallied (however, items should not be tallied 
twice if randomly selected transe cts are adjacent). If an item is bl own into a transect mid-survey, 
it is tallied only if the surveyor has not yet surv eyed the section of the transect where the item is 
located. Multiple fragments of what may have or iginally been a whole item should be tallied 
separately. Capturing information on the total number of fragments present is a better reflection 
of the debris impacts and effort required for cleanup. If one fragment is recognizable as a 
specific item, for example a remnant of a plastic be verage bottle, it should be recorded as such 
provided that the remnant is at least 50% of th e original item (Tangaroa Blue Foundation, 2012).   
 Items that do not fall under a specific subcategor y can be entered into the “other” category at the 
end of each material section. In order to ensure  that these standardized methods are widely 
applicable, NOAA’s online shoreline survey databa se allows users to create custom debris 
categories
1. This allows researchers to track locally -relevant debris items within a nationally-
standardized format.  If a surveyor is unsure of an item’s material t ype, it is tallied in the other/non-classifiable 
category at the end of the data sheet. Include a br ief description of the item in the notes section 
for clarification. Items that are composed of  multiple material types should be recorded 
according to the most abundant material that ma kes up the surface of the item. For example, a 
tire with a metal rim would likely be recorded as a large rubber item. A debris item photo guide 
is included in Section 7.6. Digita l photographs should be taken of unidentifiable items, as well as 
other debris items or markings of interest. Place a lined ru ler next to the debris item to establish a 
size reference. It is also a good practice to take  a photo of each transect  surveyed, and record 
photo ID numbers on the data sheet.    
16 
 The macro-debris item concentrat ion (number of debris items/m2) per transect is calculated as 
follows:  
ܥൌ݊
ሺݓൈ݈ሻ 
 
C = concentration of debris items (# of debris items/m2) 
n = # of macro-debris items observed 
w = width (m) of shoreline section record ed during sampling (i.e, transect width) 
l = length (m) of shoreline sampled = 5 m 
 Note that the shoreline width that is measured at  each transect is essential for calculating debris 
concentrations. For a given sampling event:  
1. Calculate debris concentrations for each individual transect surveyed (a minimum of four 
per survey). 
2. Take the mean of the concentrations at each transect to calcu late an overall site 
concentration (± standard deviation) for that date. 
 
The previously mentioned online database exports  survey data (counts) and concentrations per 
debris item category, material type, large debris, and total debris.  
  
2.8 Sampling for Meso- (5 mm – 2.5 cm) and Micro-Debris (≤5 mm) 
 
Random samples can be collected from sandy beach  locations for analysis of meso- and micro-
debris. For random sampling within a shoreline segment, use a random number table (Section 
7.4) to select the placement of a 1-m2 quadrat. The placement of the number on the random 
number table determines the location of the sa mple. For example, if random number seven was 
chosen, the placement of the quadrat would be on the right side of the transect in the wrack line.  
 Because shoreline meso- and micro-debris con centrations are very patchy, random quadrat 
placement may not always be the preferred me thod. During field testing in the coastal mid-
Atlantic, meso-debris was very rare in randomly se lected samples (meso-debris occurred in only 
2-3% of sample events; Versar , Inc.  2012). Therefore, depend ing on study objectives, it may be 
appropriate to focus meso-debris sampling on sec tions of the shoreline where small debris is 
more likely to accumulate. Previous studies ha ve suggested sampling along the wrack line, 
where less re-suspension and thus higher debris concentrations ar e expected to occur, and to 
avoid the effect of tidal height on the deposition of debris of va rious sizes and densities (Browne 
et al., 2010). Van Cauwenberghe et al. (2013) found significantly  higher concentrations of 
microplastic at the high-water mark compared to the low-water mark on Belgian shorelines. 
However, if samples are colle cted in a non-random fashion (i .e., focused on the wrack line), 
results cannot be extrapolated over larger spatial scales.  17 
  
 
Figure 4.  Randomly placed 1 m2 quadrat with area of sand to be sieved (0.0625 m2) in bold. 
 
Once the quadrat placement is selected, remove a ny pieces of debris from the surface that are 
larger than 2.5 cm (and should have been count ed in the macro-debris survey). Use a small 
stainless steel shovel to colle ct the top 3 cm of sand from  1/16 of the quadrat (0.0625 m2).  This 
is done by dividing the quadrat into fourths and th en dividing one of the quarters into fourths 
(Figure 4). Sieve the collected sand through a stai nless steel 5 mm mesh sieve above a bucket or 
funnel and sample jar. If the sand is wet, use a water rinse to facilita te the sieving process 
(seawater that has been sieved through a 0.33-mm screen is suffici ent for this purpose). Transfer 
the sieved micro-debris samples to labeled amber gl ass bottles for further an alysis back in the lab 
(Baker et al., 2013). If it is not  possible to properly identify me so-debris items (> 5 mm) in the 
field they should be collected and analyzed back in the lab. Repeat this process for each of the 
four transects that were sampled for macro-debris.  Meso- and micro-debris item con centration (# of debris items/m
3) is calculated as follows: 
 
ܥൌ	݊
ሺܽൈ݄ሻ 
 
C = concentration of debris items (# of debris items/m3) 
n = # of debris items observed 
a = area sampled = 0.0625 m2  
h = depth of sample = 0.03 m 
 
Provided that samples are collected randomly, meso - and micro-debris concentrations for a given 
sampling event can be calculated according to th e same approach as for macro-debris (Section 
2.7). 
 
 
2.9 Quality Control 
18 
  
To ensure that all of the appropriately sized debr is items within a transect are recorded, quality 
control estimates should be conducted by a second surveyor before the collection of the meso- 
and micro-debris sample. The second surveyor  should assess 20% of the total number of 
transects sampled per site over th e course of the study (e.g., one si te visited monthly will have a 
total of 48 transects and 10 quali ty assurance / quality contro l samples). Quality assurance 
sampling should be distributed among different sampling events and include consideration of 
debris classification.    
 
2.10 Considerations 
 
Shoreline surveys are the most accessible and cost -effective mode of marine debris monitoring 
and assessment. Depending on study objectives, additional data coll ection needs may be 
identified, for example debris location on the shor eline, number of beach visitors, or information 
on debris biofouling. This information can be include d in the notes section of the data sheets or 
on a separate form. Surveys can be conducted by  appropriately trained and managed volunteers 
to reduce costs, but as with any citizen-scie nce effort, volunteer coordination is a major (and 
often overlooked) task. Site se lection, proper debris classifica tion, and survey schedule often 
prompt questions from new volunteers. A frequen tly asked questions document is provided in 
Section 7.7.  As mentioned above, care should be given to av oid threatened or endangered species and 
habitats during site selection and while conductin g surveys. While removal of debris from the 
environment is an important endeavor, it is not  a long-term solution. Th e distinction between 
standing-stock and accumulation surveys, and the information gleaned from each, is important. Leaving debris on the shoreline al lows surveyors to assess the vari ation in debris loads over time, 
which is essential information for quantifying the impacts of debris on the marine environment and making the case for increased prevention and mitigation efforts.   19 
 3.0 SURFACE WATER METHODS 
 
Floating marine debris has been noted by research  and other vessels since 1971 (Carpenter et al., 
1972; Carpenter and Smith, 1972). However, few sy stematic quantificatio n surveys have been 
conducted throughout the oceans to develop a cohesi ve understanding of the extent and degree of 
pollution from floating marine debris.   Reported debris concentrations range from less than 1 piece/km
2 to 20,328 ± 2324 pieces/km2 in 
the subtropical Atlantic Ocean (Law et al., 2010 ), to potentially higher concentrations in the 
North Pacific Ocean (NRC 2008; see Section 7.1). In addition to a lack of standard sampling 
methodologies, metrics vary by study objective which complicates debris concentration 
comparisons. Weight and number of items are us ed to measure debris items, while area and 
volume measure the matrix sampled (Section 7.1).   This section provides rigorous, standardized me thodologies for assessing the amount and type of 
floating anthropogenic debris and guidance for th e development of a robust survey design for 
coastal and offshore waters. Guidelines were de veloped to be flexible enough to conduct both 
coastal and offshore assessments. A goal for these guidelines is to increase the amount of surface 
water marine debris data that can be levera ged from tangentially-re lated organizations and 
projects that routinel y conduct surface trawling. Data collect ed can facilitate comparisons to 
assess where floating debris is most prevalent and contribute to assessments of the eventual fate 
and risk posed by the debris.   
3.1 Floating debris survey techniques 
 Floating marine debris and debris suspended in surface waters has been documented across the 
world in the open ocean and in coastal waters. In  general, efforts to monitor oceanic marine 
debris have been informal, with many anecdotal reports, few scientific expeditions that included 
floating debris sighting surveys, and even fewer sc ientific expeditions dedicated to collection and 
quantification of floating marine  debris samples. Early marine debris sampling was often 
conducted with pelagic plankton sampling. Methods  have varied over the years to include 
oblique plankton tows (Carpenter et al., 1972) and Neuston nets towed across surface waters 
(Colton et al., 1974, Yamashita and Tanimura, 2007). In the North Atlantic Ocean, the Sea 
Education Association used Neuston nets towed by a sailing vessel in a standard procedure to 
produce a 22-year data set (Law et al., 2010). Mo ore et al. (2001b, 2002) published some of the 
first reports that demonstrate the use of a ma nta net in conducting de bris trawls. Brown and 
Cheng (1981) note an advantage of the manta net is  the two parava nes that attach to the frame 
and allow the net mouth to skim the surface of the water.  Thompson et al. (2004) determined 
plastic fragment concentrations in archived  samples collected with a continuous plankton 
recorder.  Variability in the physical construction of nets , towing conditions, and overall technique make it 
difficult to interpret temporal and spatial trends of floating debris concen trations. These studies 
demonstrate a large variability in the physical co nstruction of nets used in surface water debris 20 
 surveys, in terms of aperture, mesh size, and net length. Towing conditions, such as tow speed 
and trawl length, vary depending on the overa ll study objective (Secti on 7.1). Reported mesh 
sizes have ranged from 150 to 947 µm (NRC 2008)  and though studies have not yet targeted 
floating nano-sized debris particles, it is pos sible that these could be  sampled with various 
whole-water sampling techniques. Marine debris was investigated  in new and archived surface 
water plankton tow samples from the CalCOFI pr ogram (Gilfillan et al. 2009, Doyle et al. 2011), 
which uses a manta net equipped with a flowmete r and 0.505 mm mesh for 15 minutes at a speed 
of approximately 1.0-1.5 knots. These methods ha ve been employed in standard plankton tows 
for decades, and proved effective for sampling debris in surface waters. 
 We evaluated the methodology from published literature to develop the guidelines presented in 
this document, which are heavily influenced by the California Cooperative Ocean and Fisheries 
Investigations (CalCOFI). Th e surface water debris sampling technique and study design 
described in this section were tested in a p ilot sampling effort conducted in the Chesapeake Bay, 
as well as in a more rigorous te sting of nearshore coastal wate rs in the Delmarva Peninsula 
(Versar, Inc. 2012).     
3.2 Survey Design 
 
Few studies have repeatedly sampled an area for marine debris using a standardized technique; 
often measurements are tangentia l to primary study objectives a nd debris data are not published. 
Even when long-term data exist, the patchine ss of debris distribution may obscure expected 
trends (Law et al., 2010).   To test the utility of the surface water guidelines described here, Versar, Inc. developed a nested 
survey design (Versar, Inc. 2012; see Section 7.3 ). As discussed in Sect ion 2.4, at the coarsest 
level, two regions in the coastal mid-Atlantic United States were selected based on land use 
(urban vs. rural). Within each region, three 1000 -m locations (stretches  of shoreline) were 
identified. Adjacent to each location, nine surf ace water sampling stations were selected and 
remained fixed for the duration of the study. To avoid tow direction bias , direction of the tow 
was randomly assigned for each trawl. Surveys were conducted on a bi-weekly basis for a period 
of six months in accordance with the sampling t echnique described below. Results of the study 
indicate that floating macro-de bris abundances in urban and rural locations did not differ 
significantly, but differences among locations and temporal trends were detected using this 
survey design.   Given the widely variable debris  concentrations noted by publishe d reports and during testing by 
Versar, Inc., it is difficult to provide strict recommendations a bout survey design. Survey design 
should consider the following suggestions while tailoring the study to addr ess specific questions 
about floating marine debris.  
 
3.2.1 Site Selection   
 
The coastal sampling design presen ted here pursues a regional pe rspective on floating debris and 
its relationship to shoreline de bris. Additional considerations  for offshore sampling include 21 
 oceanographic conditions; known currents, eddies , convergence patterns, mixing, and seasonal 
fluctuations therein; known or potential sources of marine de bris; shipping lanes; and the 
bathymetry and geomorphic structures that may influence the generation and eventual fate of 
floating debris. Groups conducti ng offshore sampling are str ongly encouraged to conduct 
surveys in conjunction with ongoing marine re search and/or water quality assessments.  
 To provide a statistically robust dataset, select ed sites for coastal surface water sampling should 
be stratified based on ap propriate parameters, for example la nd use (e.g., urban, rural) associated 
with nearby shorelines, fishing activities, or  storm water or sewage outfalls. Random site 
selection from each stratum (stratified random samp ling) is a useful tool to assess temporal and 
spatial variability while controlling for some of  the expected variabil ity and reducing sampling 
error. In order to compare shoreline and adjacen t surface water debris co ncentrations, shoreline 
site selection should occur before any su rface water site sel ection takes place.  
 Additionally, sites should have the following characteristics: 
 
 Direct, seasonal or year-round access, depending on location  
 Located within one nautical mile from shor e for comparison to shoreline debris loads  
 No stationary or transient in-water barriers to ship transect path  
 Preferably areas that have not seen re cent changes or manmade alterations to 
hydrographic patterns  
 These characteristics should be met where possibl e, but should be analyzed on a case-by-case 
basis and modified if appropriate for a particul ar region/location. This te chnique may be adapted 
or modified to monitor riverine, coastal, and offshore locations.   
3.2.2 Sample Number and Frequency  
 
In addition to standardizing th e technique and equipment use d, it is equally important to 
complete enough sampling to account for heterogene ity in debris concentration (e.g., Pichel et 
al., 2007). Depending on study objectives, detec ting significant trends  or making regional 
comparisons may require an infeasible sample si ze (Ryan et al., 2009, Versar, Inc., 2012). It may 
be advantageous to conduct survey s initially more frequently to unde rstand the spread of the data 
and factors affecting variability (MSFD, 2013). To increase confidence in debris concentration 
estimates, balance spatial distribution of sampli ng and the number of floating debris transects 
within a location with the amount of  replication required at the shor eline site level (Versar, Inc., 
2012).  Once location is determined, at least ten transe cts are identified, plotted in mapping software, 
and randomly numbered. Three numbers are select ed from a random number table to determine 
which transects are evaluated on a sampling event.  At least three transects should be completed 
within two nautical miles parallel to the adjace nt shoreline site and w ithin one nautical mile 
perpendicular to the shore (Figure 5). We s uggest surveyors pair the surface water sampling 
frequency with adjacent shoreline assessments. A nd, where possible, groups are encouraged to 
conduct surveys in conjunction with ongoing marine research and/or water quality assessments.  22 
  
 
Figure 5.   Shoreline and pelagic sampling should be coordinated so that the pelagic trawl transects occur within two 
nautical miles of the shoreline assessment sites (here, de noted as a single 100 m sec tion of beach). Three trawls, 
each approximately 0.5 nm, will be conducted at each site . Red circles represent points at which to note GPS 
coordinates. If obstructions are present, it is necessary to take GPS coordinates whenever the vessel changes heading 
and not only at the beginning and end of each trawl transect. 
 
 
3.3 Equipment 
 The following equipment is suggested to perfor m surface trawls for floa ting marine debris:  
 Nautical charts  
 Digital camera  
 Hand-held GPS unit  
 Extra batteries (suggest rechargeable batteries)  
 Manta net  
 Detachable cod end (+ one spare)  
 Bridle for manta net  
 Weights to attach to frame, if  in offshore or choppy waters  
 Flowmeter  
 Stopwatch  
23 
  Squirt bottles  
 Plastic buckets with handles (two 5-gallon)  
 Stainless steel sieves (5-mm and 0.30-mm mesh)  
 Calipers  
 First aid kit (including sunscr een, bug spray, drinking water)  
 Work gloves for hauling the net  
 Latex gloves (or appropriate alte rnative) for handling the sample  
 Stainless steel forceps, 6-inch, angled tip, for picking out larger debris items  
 32-ounce (~1 L) amber glass sample bottles with lids  
 Wide-mouth funnel (stainless st eel) to fit glass bottles  
 Clipboards  
 Data sheets (on waterproof paper)  
 Waterproof labels for jars, pre-labele d and affixed to jars prior to trawls  
 Pencils  
 Permanent markers  
 White trays, 12-inches square (o r equivalent) for sorting debris  
 Stainless steel spatula, ~8-inches in lengt h, with tapered and rounded ends for sorting 
debris  
 Sealant to repair net holes  
 Bags for large debris items  
 Instrument to measure water quality parameters (optional)  
  
3.4 Pre-Survey Site Characterization 
 
Before completing floating debris surveys, shor eline characterization is completed for each 100 
m site. See Section 2.0 of this document for the methodology.   
 For surveys of coastal waters ad jacent to shoreline sites, current bathymetric maps should be 
obtained for the area within two nautical miles of  the chosen shoreline site. Several potential 
sites for trawls are chosen based on ease of acce ss and strata described in the survey design 
section. It is ideal to complete a survey of  the surrounding surface waters before any sampling 
begins. For studies with concur rent shoreline surveys, any pertinent information on hydrography, 
bathymetry, and in-water barriers is also desc ribed in the “notes” section of the shoreline 
characterization data sheet.   Select transects prior to arrival at the site. Ea ch data sheet captures ancillary data and data 
pertaining to a single trawl event.  Ancillary data may be recorded  before arrival at the site. 
 Each trawl transect has a unique iden tification in this suggested format: 
 
Site ID_year-month-day_transect # 
 
An example is [MD-MR_2010-01-07_T1] for a traw l completed in Maryland’s Middle River on 
January 7, 2010 along the first transect (i dentified as T1 in mapping software). 24 
  
 
3.5 Surface Water Trawl Survey Methodology (> 0.30 mm) 
 
3.5.1 Trawling technique 
 
 
Figure 6.  In-water setup for a manta tow. The vessel shown has an A-frame at the stern th at is fully depressed, 
which supports a tow rope that is cleated to achieve an d angle of ~20° between the vessel and the net to minimize 
interaction with the vessel’s wake. The shorter side of the bridle should be closer to the vessel to help facilitate 
avoidance of sampling the wake.  
 
All transects follow the same trawling techniqu e. A manta net, with a body composed of 0.330 
mm nylon mesh and measuring approximately 3 m in  length, is towed horizontally at the surface 
(Figure 6). Depending on sea stat e, weights are added to the bridle to ensure balanced 
positioning and coverage of the surface waters. A lternately, weights may be added to a tow line 
that connects the bridle to the wi nch line. A swivel connects the to w rope to the manta net bridle, 
which is offset so that one side is slightly long er to encourage a towing a ngle that samples waters 
outside of the vessel’s wake. A buoy is attached to the net for safety and retrieval purposes. 
 A digital or analog flowmeter is at tached to the net frame and suspended in the center of the net 
mouth. An initial flowmeter read ing is taken prior to deploymen t of the net apparatus; this 
25 
 reading should not change before placement in the water. The net is deployed from the back or 
the side of the vessel, with enough slack to a llow the net to smoothly skim the surface of the 
water and avoid the vessel’s wake. The side para vanes of the manta net should be on the water’s 
surface. An angle of approximately 20 degrees be tween the line of the vessel and the net is 
desirable for minimizing interaction with the vess el wake. The shorter side of the bridle should 
be closer to the vessel to obtain th e required towing angle (Figure 6).  
 The trawl is deployed for approximately 0.5 na utical miles at a speed of 1-3 knots, an 
approximately 15 minute duration. When noting th e in-water time, include time for deployment 
and retraction when the net is submerged in th e water and the flowmete r is recording volume. 
During the trawl, vessel speed and tow rope length may be adjusted to ensure the net is properly 
skimming the surface away from the vessel wake . One person watches the net and notes any 
large debris items that may be initially funnele d into the net mouth. These should be detailed on 
a large debris data sheet.  GPS coordinates are recorded in degree decima l format at the beginning and ending point of 
each trawl transect. This can be done with a hand held GPS unit or by marking coordinates of the 
vessel’s transect path in mapping software. If obstructions are present in the area and require 
alteration of the original transect, GPS coordina tes should be recorded when the vessel changes 
heading (Figure 5).  
3.5.2 Sample Processing 
 
The flowmeter reading is recorded as soon as the net is recovered. Contents  of the net are gently 
washed with natural seawater from the outside, in to the cod end. If possible, ambient seawater is 
filtered through a 0.333 mm mesh sieve to remove particles that could bias the sample. The cod end is detached and its entire contents are rins ed with seawater. Digi tal photos document the 
process throughout, especially the cod end contents at the end of each trawl.  
 Samples may be processed on the vessel or transf erred to labeled sample jars for laboratory 
processing. Any  obvious large debris items, >30 cm, are c ounted on a separate large debris data 
sheet, rinsed to collect any small attached par ticles, photographed, and then  stored in bags or 
discarded appropriately. Large natu ral items can be discarded but s hould be rinsed to collect any 
small attached particles; items may be record ed on the data sheet and photographed depending 
on study objectives.  
 When processing samples on the vessel, the remaining sample from the cod end is rinsed into stacked stainless steel sieves (5 mm and 0.333 mm ) to separate debris items into two size 
fractions, (x > 5 mm) and (5 mm > x > 0.333 mm). Proper rinsing with squirt bottles filled with 
ambient seawater is essential to  collect all natural and anthro pogenic particles that may be 
attached to debris items and natural contents (e.g., floating leaves, woody stems, pine needles, 
jellyfish). Rinsing is important if samples will be  analyzed for microplastic concentration; in that 
case, the study design may consider using deionized  water for rinsing to decrease potential bias. 
Debris items larger than 5 mm are sorted by mate rial category and tallied on debris data sheets. 
Macro-debris may then be disc arded appropriately or archived  depending on study objectives. 26 
 The size fraction smaller than 5 mm , composed of micro-debris, is carefully rinsed into glass 
sample bottles and stored frozen to  prevent any sample degradation. 
 If samples are not processed on the vessel, step s are taken to condense the sample by minimizing 
rinsing and cataloging any large de bris items. Large items are pr ocessed as described above and 
removed from the sample. Trawl contents are rins ed into glass sample jars for sieving in the 
laboratory, following the sieving technique described above. Samp les are processed as soon as 
possible to avoid the need for initia l freezing or chemical preservation.  
 Analytical methods are availabl e for processing water, sediment , and sand samples to quantify 
microplastic debris (Baker et al ., 2013). When applicable, archiv ing frozen samples for further 
analyses is suggested.  
 3.6 Data analysis 
 Volume of water filtered during e ach trawl is calculated based on the flowmeter used. In general, 
distance is calculated per trawl by subtracting the initial and fina l readings of the flowmeter and 
applying a correction factor specific to the flowmeter. Distance is then multiplied by the area of the net mouth to determine a volume of wa ter filtered. The concentration (#items/m
3) of macro-
debris items is calculated as follows:  
ܥൌ݊
ܸ 
 
C = concentration of debris items (# of debris items/m3) 
n = # of debris items observed 
V= volume of water filtered (m3) = [(net mouth width) × (net mouth height) × d ] 
d = distance traveled = (flowmeter final – flowmeter initial) × correction factor 
 For a given sampling event: 
1. Calculate debris concentrations for each i ndividual transect surv eyed (a minimum of 
three per survey) using the equation above 
2. Take the mean of the three concentrations to calculate an overall site concentration (with 
a standard deviation) for that date  
 
3.7 Quality Control 
 
Quality control procedures increase the efficien cy, accuracy, and precision of floating debris 
assessments. Safety and data management plans should be in place before sampling begins. For 
accuracy in positioning of trawl tr ansects, develop a survey design before sampling begins and 
use a GIS to label all potentia l transects. Naming conventions should be standardized for 
notation on sample labels and data sheets.   27 
 Consistently following a standardi zed procedure is essential. Traw ling and processing techniques 
should be monitored for consistency. During trawli ng, watch the manta net to ensure that it is 
properly skimming the water’s surf ace without creating excessive sp lashing of water in the net 
mouth that influences water sampling. If the manta net is not skimming properly, vessel speed 
(or other parameters) should be tweaked to pr ovide appropriate positi oning and water flow 
through the net. Debris counts s hould be confirmed by two individua ls if possible; at least 20% 
samples should be analyzed separately by two people for quality assura nce. Debris samples 
should be saved for additional testin g if material type is not dete rmined. For studies investigating 
micro-debris, rinsing standards are important and the suggestions listed here may be appended 
with additional controls such as using deionize d or filtered water for rinsing, and conducting all 
rinsing within a controlled labor atory environment. Sieves a nd equipment should be thoroughly 
rinsed between trawl events. All instruments should be calib rated and cleaned regularly. 
Equipment and rigging should be cleaned a nd inspected after each sampling event. 
 
 
3.8 Considerations 
 
Assessing floating debris quantity and compositi on presents challenges and confounding factors. 
The recommended technique for floating debris su rveys is meant to be robust to slight 
modifications depending on study objectives, and this  has been noted in the text. This section 
presents additional considerations for employing the floating debris survey technique.  
3.8.1 Survey design 
 
As discussed in Section 1.2, debris sources and poin ts of input are often im possible to determine. 
Several categories have been id entified, including (1) larger pi eces from land-based runoff or 
actual release; (2) larg er pieces from ocean-based dumping or accidental release; (3) smaller 
pieces that result from the degradation of larger marine debris in the environment; and (4) small 
debris, for example, micro- and nano-plastics us ed in consumer products (e.g., plastic beads used 
as an exfoliant in soaps) that enter the waste st ream from regular use and are likely discharged 
with wastewater (Fendall and Sewell 2009). Programs that seek to understand the source of 
debris should heavily consider survey design in terms of both selecting appropriate sites to 
monitor and adding enough replication to constrai n the variability in debris concentrations 
attributed to environmental conditions.  Local weather, runoff, other potential point sour ces of debris, and ocea nographic conditions will 
be important to consider in the study design. Wh ere possible, groups are encouraged to conduct 
surveys in conjunction with ongoing  marine research and/or water quality assessments. This may 
necessitate adjustment to the suggested study de sign, but more important is standardizing the 
techniques used to collect and process the floating debris samples, as well as the metrics used to 
report debris concentrations. 
 
3.8.2 Technique 
 28 
 Note that, as a general rule, faster tow speeds and larger mesh sizes will exclude smaller particles 
and will bias the sample toward larger particles. The techniques recommended here provide an overview of the amount and type of debris presen t in surface waters at a given location, but due 
to operational constraints will not sample the enti re water column or obtain all debris. Particles 
smaller than 0.33 mm (the suggested mesh si ze) will escape during trawling. Trawl transect 
lengths may be optimized based on local cond itions. For example, during a phytoplankton bloom 
the mesh may become clogged and will not filter effectively. Techniques that diverge from the 
standard transect length or st andard tow speed are especially  encouraged to measure flow 
volume per trawl, in order to account for varyi ng flow volumes in calculated concentrations. 
 Depending on study objectives, samples may be pro cessed in a clean labo ratory environment 
with slight changes to sieving technique such as a more thorough washing with deionized water, 
a more detailed sorting based on additional size  classes (e.g., additional sieving through a 1-mm 
screen), drying the total sample, and weighing de bris items. All visible debris items may be 
measured with calipers.   If study objectives involve correlating debris loads and water quality, parameters such as 
dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, etc. should be  recorded at the beginning and end of each 
transect.  
3.8.3 Data analysis 
 
The reporting unit is extremely important when ma king comparison to other comparable studies. 
 For macro-debris, count (debris pieces) per volume (water filtered) provides an accurate measurement. This is a departure from most historic and present-day conventions, but is 
commonly used in marine plankton studies, is fair ly simple to obtain, and allows for comparison 
of macro-debris concentrations in other matri ces such as sand and sediments. Volumetric 
measures of surface water debris are useful because debris, espe cially plastic debris, can be 
neutrally buoyant and exist at depth in the wate r column due to wind-driven mixing (Kukulka et 
al., 2012). In the future, it may be possible to us e measurements of floating marine debris to 
integrate a measurement through the water colu mn; and thus providing an estimate for the 
amount of water filtered in each trawl would enhance parameterization.  
 In some cases it may be useful to obtain mass me asurements to estimate debris density within a 
given parcel of water (g/m
3). This measurement is informative for macro-debris, but is especially 
important for micro-debris particles that may not  be easily counted. In addition, density estimates 
of micro-debris may be compared to density estim ates of natural material  in a given size class 
which provides an easily understood ra tio of debris to the naturally occurring particles. Density 
is easily compared to whole water samples, be nthic sediment grabs, and plankton abundance 
measurements that may be obtained in the sa me study. For very small particles (<1 mm), mass 
measurements will likely be more accurate than count.  
3.8.4 Relevance 
 29 
 Given the high variability in floating debris conc entration, it may not be cost-effective to conduct 
enough sampling to accurately compare locatio ns or regions, or to understand which 
environmental variables most influence debris co ncentration (Versar, Inc. , 2012). To address this 
reality and strive for relevance with these techniques, this docu ment stresses the benefits of 
completing floating marine debris surveys in conjunction with ongoing marine research and/or 
water quality surveys for increased  efficiency in data collecti on. In addition, these techniques 
sample both macro- and micro-debris. Particles smaller than 5 mm have been documented in 
many water samples that did not contain macro-de bris. Understanding the f actors that affect the 
size distribution and particle con centration of debris in the ocean  is important to advance the 
state of the science regarding debris movement, distribution, and degradation. These floating 
debris assessment techniques may be applied to address additional research questions beyond 
those posed at the beginn ing of this section.  30 
 4.0 AT-SEA VISUAL SURVEY METHODS 
 
4.1 Background 
 
Ship-based visual surveys are a relatively ea sy, cost-effective method for crowd-sourcing open 
ocean marine debris sightings (i.e., from ve ssels of opportunity) and can provide useful 
information on the types of debris  commonly encountered and spatia l and temporal variability of 
floating debris. The accuracy of reports generated from ship-based debris sightings is affected by 
environmental factors (e.g., weather conditions, se a state) and variation between observers (Ryan 
et al., 2009) and vessel size and speed (Rees and Pond, 1995). On larger vessels, observers are 
typically situated higher above the water surf ace and farther from the bow (e.g., on the bridge), 
which causes items very close to the bow to go unde tected (Thiel et al., 2011). To account for the 
likelihood of surveyors missing so me debris items located on a transect (Ryan 2013) apply a 
correction factor to measured debris counts based on item size and distance. Line transect 
sampling methods (where the perp endicular distance to each item is recorded) may reduce bias 
(Burnham and Anderson, 1984), but is not recommende d for novice observers. It  is important to 
recognize that although the majority of debris fl oating on the ocean surface is from the smaller 
size fractions (e.g., Law et al., 2010, Doyle et al . 2011, van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013), visual 
sightings will be skewed toward larger debris items. Further, unlike surface water trawls which 
will capture debris just beneath the surface (i.e., debris that has been subjected to wind mixing), 
visual surveys will only account for debris that is visible at the surface.  Visual survey data 
should be interpreted as a low- end estimate of the total concen tration of floating debris.  
 A number of confounding factors mu st be taken into consideration for accurate comparisons of 
floating debris concentrations across time and space. Similar to marine debris in other 
environmental compartments, ther e is a lot of variability and patchiness in the abundance of 
floating debris. Large-scale conve rgence zones (e.g., the North Paci fic High Pressure Zone), as 
well as small and meso-scale circulation features , may concentrate floati ng debris and create 
ephemeral debris patches. Areas of concentrated debris (which often also  include natural debris) 
can be difficult to quantify from a moving vesse l. One data analysis technique is to pool 
sightings from very long transects to account for debris patches (e.g., Ryan 2013 used 50 km 
transect lengths).   Quantitative comparisons of different visual survey efforts noted in the literature are difficult to make due to the differences in reporti ng units (e.g., #items/km or #items/km
2), minimum debris 
size (studies have varied from 1.5 – 10 cm (Secti on 7.1)), and transect width (up to 100 m; e.g., 
Morris, 1980, Shiomoto and Kameda, 2005). Relative  to debris classification systems used for 
other types of marine debris mon itoring, a simplified data sheet s hould be used for visual surveys 
as it is difficult to collect deta iled and accurate information on debris types from a ship-based 
observer. Thus, the visual survey data sheet provided in Section 7.5 does not cover the same 
level of detail as data sheets for shorelin e sampling and surface water trawls. Given the 
uncertainty in detection and patchiness of larg e debris items, data collected through visual 
surveys may be most useful for qualitative assess ments of the types and relative abundances of 
floating debris.  31 
  4.2 Survey Design 
 
Cheshire et al. (2009) provides me thods for setting up a prescribed visual survey pattern in a 
given area and also for transect sampling. Given th e widely variable debris  concentrations noted 
by published reports, it is difficult to provide strict recommendations about survey design. 
Survey design should consider the suggestions put forth in the surface water trawl technique 
(Section 3.2), while tailoring the study to address specific questions  about floating marine debris.  
Visual surveys may complement surface water tr awl surveys and shoreline surveys. A survey 
design that includes visual surveys of floating de bris conducted in conjunction with other survey 
types will lead to a more robust data set. Wh ere possible, groups are encouraged to conduct 
surveys in conjunction with ongoing  marine research and/or water quality assessments. This may 
include vessels of opportunity as well as structured studi es that monitor at standard intervals. 
When vessels of opportunity are used as the platfo rm for visual debris surveys, a structured study 
design is unlikely. This must be  stated when data and results are reported (Ribic et al., 1992).  
  
4.3 Equipment 
 The following equipment is suggested to perform visual surveys of floating marine debris:  
 Clipboard 
 Pencil 
 Survey forms printed on waterproof paper 
 GPS unit 
 Binoculars  
 Digital camera 
  
4.4 At-Sea Visual Survey Technique 
 
Visual surveys should be conducte d along strip transects at least 0.5 nm in length. Ancillary data, 
including environmental conditi ons and GPS locations of transect beginning and end points 
should be recorded on the visual survey form  (Section 7.5). Any changes in heading during 
individual transects should be recorded in the space provided. If possible, two surveyors should 
conduct surveys from the bow of the vessel, and data from the port and starboard sides can be 
pooled from two separate data sheets. If only one su rveyor is available, th e surveyor may want to 
conduct the survey from the glare-free side of th e vessel (Ribic et al., 1992). Each surveyor is 
responsible for visually scanning the sea surface and recording all debris > 2.5 cm that passes 
either the port or starboard side of the vessel (Figure 7). MSFD (2013) recommends that visual 
surveys not be conducted when environmental conditi ons are such that this minimum debris size 
cannot be detected, and provides suggested transect widths (rangi ng from 3 to 15 meters) based 
on vessel speed and height of th e observer above the water (rep roduced in Table 2). It is 
important to note that these suggested transect widths need to undergo fu rther testing, and should 
be used only as a starting point. Binoculars ma y be used to verify the identity of items. 32

Figure 7.  During visual surveys, observers are responsible for vi sually scanning the sea surf ace on either the port or 
starboard side of the vessel, within a defined transect width. 
 
Visual survey data should be reported in terms of # items/km2, based on the transect width and 
length (determined from latitude  and longitude of transect st art and end points). To get an 
understanding of variability in de tection from different observers, quality control surveys should 
be conducted on 20% of survey transects, by a se cond visual observer on the same side of the 
33 
 vessel. Quality control surveys should be di stributed among different sampling events and 
include consideration of debris classification and total count.   
  
4.5 Considerations 
 
As discussed above, ship-based debris observa tions can provide useful information on the 
abundances and types of debris floating at the sea surface. However, given the patchiness of 
surface water debris and uncertainty in debris cl assification during visual surveys, researchers 
must give careful consideration to survey de sign and standardization between observers and 
platforms in order to develop robust estimat es of floating debris concentrations.  
  34 
 5.0 BENTHIC METHODS 
 
The information provided in this section is inte nded to guide development of benthic surveys to 
ensure that data and results can be integrated with surveys in other environmental compartments. 
Integration and standardization of survey effo rts between shorelines, surface waters, and the 
benthos is important to understa nd and model the life cy cle and behavior of debris. We suggest 
that groups interested in deve loping a benthic survey program follow the guidelines below and 
refer to more detailed protocols provided by the MSFD (MSFD, 2013). 
  
5.1 Background 
 Historical methods for detection and survey of benthic debris vary according to vessel 
capabilities and available equipment, target debris type and size,  location, personnel (e.g., 
availability, skill level, training, technical abil ities), and environmental conditions (e.g., depth, 
water clarity, current strength). Benthic monitoring  efforts are often cost -prohibitive and more 
logistically challenging than some other types of marine debris monitoring (namely, shoreline 
monitoring), and there is often a lot of spatia l variability in benthic debris concentrations. 
However, the seafloor is recognized as a potentia lly significant debris si nk that should not be 
ignored.    MSFD (2013) provides suggested methods based on depth, divided between shallow (< 20 m; 
SCUBA), shelf (up to 800 m; traw ls), and deep sea floor environm ents; the sections that follow 
provide a general overview of the MSFD (2013) s uggested approach. It is recognized that there 
is no single technique that will work across surv ey efforts in diverse environments and with 
different objectives and availabl e resources. The guidelines presen ted here should be used as a 
guiding framework during the plan ning process, during which opera tion-specific protocols and 
safety measures will be developed. 
 Benthic debris items should be catalogued accordi ng to the same classification system used for 
other environmental compartments. That is, debris  should be tallied according to the material 
types and item categories captured on shorelin e and surface water data sheets (Section 7.5). 
Further, to ensure comparability with data co llected on shorelines and in surface waters, the 
focus should be on debris abundance (count and c oncentration) rather than weight. However, 
from a management perspective it might be info rmative and efficient to concurrently collect 
volume, size, and/or weight estimates. In instan ces where debris is not collected during surveys, 
there will be a lower degree of confidence in  accurate item classi fication (e.g., diver or 
submersible surveys). A list of th e benthic marine debris survey literature reviewed is provided 
in Section 7.1. Side scan sonar is not considered here given that it is only feasible for detection of 
large debris items, for example derelict crab  pots (Stevens et al., 2000; Morison and Murphy, 
2009).  Although assessment of micro-debris (< 5 mm) is not  a focus of this document, it is worth noting 
that concurrent sampling of this small size fr action during macro-debris  assessment requires the 
use of sediment grabs or trawls with a fine mesh size (e.g., Cole et al., 2011). 35 
  
 
5.2 Survey Design 
 
5.2.1 Site Selection 
 
Survey locations are dependent on accessibilit y, study objectives, and available resources and 
equipment. Sensitive habitats or species and underwater hazards should be avoided. This includes sites that may contain unexploded ordi nance or have features that may pose an 
entanglement hazard to divers or gear. Given the patchiness of benthic debris, sampling should 
focus on areas where debris is suspected to accumu late and may be stratified by factors such as 
land use, proximity to river mouths, substrate, tourism, fishing pressure, or oceanic current 
patterns. Bathymetry and hydrodynamics should be c onsidered during site se lection as there is 
growing evidence of their influence on benthic de bris accumulations (e.g., Galgani et al. 1996; 
Keller et al. 2010). Acha et al. ( 2003) show that salinity fronts asso ciated with river mouths tend 
to trap debris and may be common accumulation areas.  
5.2.2 Sample Frequency  
 
Survey frequency for benthic debris assessm ents should be determined based on study 
objectives, available resources, and expected seasonal or annual variability. In the Bay of Biscay 
(France), Galgani et al (1995a) found a greater ab undance and more spatial variability in benthic 
debris trawls during the winter / early spring compared to ot her times of the year when debris 
concentrations were more uniform. The authors suggest that this variation may be due to 
seasonal changes in coastal currents and water le vels. Quarterly or biannual sampling may be 
appropriate in regions that exhi bit less seasonali ty (e.g., tropical regions with wet / dry seasons) 
and sampling may be further restricted by weathe r conditions and accessibili ty in high latitude 
areas.   
5.3 Shallow Environments (< 20 m) 
 Based on proximity to source, shallow nearshore regions are more likely to accumulate seafloor 
debris. In areas where there are strong bottom cu rrents or intense storm activity, debris may be 
pushed farther out on the continental shelf, accumu late around rocky ledges or outcrops, or be 
deposited in offshore canyons or other depressi ons (e.g., Galgani et al ., 1996, Bauer et al., 2008, 
Kendall et al., 2007, Wei et al., 2012, Schlining et al., 2013).  
 Dive surveys along line or stri p transects are often the preferred method for assessment of 
seafloor debris in shallow or co astal environments. The ability to detect debris is a significant 
concern during underwater visual surveys, a nd the dimensions of each sampling unit (e.g., 
transect length and width) should be based on es timated debris concentr ation, detectability, and 
environmental conditions. Diver experience may also affect the degree of detection (Ribic et al., 
1992). MSFD (2013) provides a range of transect lengths (20 – 200 m) and widths (4 – 8 m) 
based on environmental conditions and debris co ncentration (based on Katsanevakis, 2009; see 36 
 Table 3). In order to double the areal coverage of surveys, the UNEP survey technique employs a 
pair of divers, one on each side of the trans ect line (Cheshire et al ., 2009). Further, MSFD 
recommends the use of a distance sampling meth od, where divers record the distance of each 
debris item from the line so that a degree of detectability can be applied during debris 
concentration calculations. A mi nimum debris size must be identified prior to any survey 
activities. The minimum debris size should be  based on study objectives but should not be 
smaller than the lower limit of detection (Donohue et al., 2001, Timmers and Kistner, 2005); 
ideally all items > 2.5 cm are detectable. Selec ting a smaller minimum debris size cut-off will 
require more time and resources. Results of dive  transect surveys are expressed in terms of 
#items/m2.

concentration. Adapted from MSFD  (2013) and Katsanevakis (2009). 
 
To ensure that all of the appropriately sized debr is items within a transect are recorded, quality 
control estimates should be conducted by a seco nd surveyor on 20% of the total number of 
transects sampled per site over the course of the study. Qualit y assurance sampling should be 
distributed among different sampling events and incl ude consideration of de bris classification.   
 
Both SCUBA and snorkel free-dive  techniques have been used for shallow water benthic debris 
assessments (e.g., Donohue et al., 2001, Bauer et al., 2008; see Section 7. 1). Existing biological 
monitoring programs that employ diver surveys may provide an opportunity for collaboration. 
Debris surveys would be more economical and efficient if combined with existing benthic 
ecology or other monitoring efforts.   For any diving activities or other use of co mpressed gas as a breathing medium (e.g., surface 
supplied air), safety is the number one prior ity and divers must be trained to a level 
commensurate with the type and conditions of the diving activity being u ndertaken. Project leads 
are responsible for understanding all aspects of dive safety regulations  and required trainings 
(e.g., OSHA distinctions between sc ientific and commercial diving)  and must ensure that their 
organization has the capacity to oversee all planne d diving activities (e.g., appropriate insurance, 
safety policies, etc.).    
5.4 Continental Shelves (up to 800 m) 
 
In locations where it is too deep for dive surv eys, debris assessments can be combined with 
ongoing trawl surveys, for example benthic ecol ogy studies or fish stock assessments (e.g., 
Keller et al., 2010). Although debris loads are likely underestimated w ith trawls, not all debris is 37 
 captured and debris may be lost while the net is returned to th e vessel; (Spengler and Costa, 
2008), trawl surveys can provide an idea of the re lative types and abundances of benthic marine 
debris, which is informative at a local or regional level. It should be noted that trawling activities 
are largely limited to smooth and flat areas of the seafloor, which are not  indicative of typical 
debris accumulation areas (Galgani  et al., 1995a). Ribic et al. (1992)  point out that variability in 
the vessel, crew, net type (including footrope),  depth sampled, and weather will affect the 
accuracy of measurements.  UNEP (Cheshire et al., 2009) provides a benthic tr awl survey design. The suggested approach is 
to select a 5 km by 5 km survey  area, create a grid of 25 km
2, randomly select three sub-blocks 
of 1 km2, and conduct five parallel trawls of 800 m each  within each selected sub-block. Trawls 
should be separated by at least 200 m and data from all transects s hould be aggregated to report 
an overall debris concentrati on. Trawl equipment should have a fixed mouth width (e.g., otter 
trawls) such that debris concentrations can be reported in units of #items/km2 based on the 
distance trawled.    To ensure that all of the appropr iately sized debris items within  a sample are recorded, quality 
control assessments should be conducted by a s econd individual on 20% of the total number of 
samples per site over the course of the study. Quality assurance sampling should be distributed 
among different sampling events and include consideration of debris classification. 
 It is important to consider the impacts of any trawling activity on benthic ecosystems, and 
sensitive or protected habitats and species should be avoided. Ma rine debris trawl surveys are 
more affordable and less destructive if co mbined with existing sampling programs. Van 
Cauwenberghe et al. (2013) applied the UNEP trawl survey design on the Belgian continental 
shelf and argue that the trawls were an  inefficient use of time and resources. 
 
 
5.5 Deep Sea Floor  
 There is a paucity of data availabl e on debris in the deep sea, pa rticularly in areas where trawling 
is not a viable option. Debris is expected to  accumulate in relatively calm areas with high 
sedimentation rates, and studies have shown that debris tends to accumulate near outcrops and in 
offshore canyons or channels (e.g., Galgani et al., 1996, Kendall et al. 2007, Wei et al., 2012, 
Schlining et al. 2013). In regions of the s eafloor with varying topography (e.g., outcrops, 
canyons, steep slopes), submersibl es are the only viab le option for marine  debris surveys. 
Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and manned s ubmersibles have previously been used for 
debris surveys (Section 7.1), but are restrictively expensive in many cases. Detectability is a 
significant concern for surveys that employ submersibles, and in some cases the vehicle may purposely avoid debris due to entanglement hazards . Further, the color, size, shape, fouling, and 
degree of burial in sediments will affect detect ability (Ribic et al., 1992) . In Monterey Bay, CA a 
22-year archive of ROV video footage was recen tly analyzed for marine debris sightings 
(Schlining et al., 2013). The study added to our  understanding of typical accumulation regions 
but no estimation of debris concentration was provided. 
  38 
 5.6 Considerations 
 
Benthic debris has been shown to inflict nega tive impacts on marine species and habitats, 
particularly corals (e.g., Schl eyer and Tomalin, 2000, Bauer et  al., 2008, Yoshikawa and Asoh, 
2004). Thus, it may be worthwhile to identify relationships between bottom communities and 
marine debris in various environments (Bauer et al., 2008). Benthic debris  typically has a very 
patchy distribution, so surveys may be a necessary first step to prioritize debris cleanup efforts, 
but considerable effort is require d in order to cover large regions of the seafloor (Galgani et al., 
1996). As mentioned above, although the benthos is likely a signi ficant sink for marine debris, 
surveys are often prohibitively expensive and logist ically complicated compared to other types of 
monitoring.   When designing a study, it is important consider  and report the lower size limit for detection, 
which will be based on the equipment used, habitat type, and in some cases water clarity. In addition, information on the depth range over which sampling occurs and total area of seafloor 
sampled is important (Spengler and Costa, 2008). Regardless of the benthic survey technique 
employed, #items/unit area  is the suggested basic reporting unit.   39

The text below is the ex
ecutive summary of the final report compiled by Versar, Inc. (Versar, 
Inc., 2012) based on comprehensive testing of the shoreline and surface water survey techniques 
presented in this document. The co mplete report can be accessed at 
www.clearinghouse.marinedebris.noaa.gov . 
Developing 
standardized protocols to quantify marine debris is critical for the protection of 
natural resources and for evaluating debris removal programs and policies designed to reduce 
marine debris. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Debris Division (MDD) developed a suite of sampling protocols to quantify marine debris on 
coastal shoreline habitats and in nearshore pelagic surface waters. We developed a large scale 
pilot project to test the ability of the protocols to quantify marine debris, monitor changes in 
debris density, and assess factors correlated with changes in debris density on short and long-
term timescales. The overall goal of the pilot project was to provide feedback to the MDD on the level of sampling effort required to implement the protocols in a larger assessment 
program. Two sampling regions representing urban and rural land use in the coastal zone of 
the mid-Atlantic Bight were chosen to conduct the pilot project. Within the urban and rural 
regions, three locations consisting of three sampling sites each were sampled for marine 
debris along the shoreline and in the ocean using visual shoreline transect surveys and pelagic net sampling methods designed by the MDD. Each region was sampled bi-weekly from June 
27
th to December 08 th, 2011 for a total of 12 sampling events per region over the 24 week 
survey.  
MDD sampling protocols were successfully employed to sample debris and make estimates 
of debris densities. Debris was more common in the shoreline compared to the pelagic 
portion of the survey for each size class of debris. Plastic was the most common form of 
debris observed. Shoreline macrodebris varied over time and at each level of spatial 
resolution except for the region level. The urban and rural region had similar debris densities. 
Differences among shoreline locations were best explained by the sampling event on which the location was sampled, the number of people per site, and the total debris density. 
Shoreline macrodebris was weakly correlated with densities of people and the week of 
sampling. Both debris density and the number of people decreased over the course of the 
survey. Relative standard errors for shoreline macrodebris at the region, location, and site 
levels indicate that reasonably precise estimat es were made (RSE<=30% in most instances). 
Pelagic macrodebris varied among locations but was similar between regions, among 
transects, and over time. Pelagic macrodebris was positively correlated with surface water 
temperature. Differences among pelagic locations were best explained by the sampling event 
during which the location was sampled and the surface water temperature. Relative standard 
errors for pelagic macrodebris at each spatial resolution indicate that estimates are imprecise due to high spatial and temporal variability of debris in the water. Sample size analyses 
indicate that sample size would have to increase exorbitantly to distinguish urban from rural 
due to the high degree of similarity between regions. Overall we found the sampling 
protocols employed in this survey are consistent and repeatable and based on our assessment 
would have the flexibility to serve as a guide for standardized methods for quantifying marine debris in small or large scale marine debris monitoring and assessment surveys. To 
further enhance these sampling protocols and future surveys we recommend (1) that a critical 
evaluation be conducted to determine the value of comparing differences in marine debris 53 between land use types, (2) additional protocol testing be conducted in other shoreline habitat 
types, (3) readily available GIS and location sp ecific data from U.S. regions be identified and 
compiled into a comprehensive GIS, and (4) that shoreline sampling continue in the location of the current pilot survey using a stratified random sampling rather than fixed sampling 
approach.

Data Entry and Submission 
Q: How do I get access to the NOAA MD-MAP database? Q: How often should I upload data to the NOAA MD-MAP database? 79 General 
Q: Our volunteers cannot make the regularly scheduled survey. How should we reschedule the 
survey?  
A: Surveys should be conducted on a regular, every 28 day schedule. If you need to miss a survey it should be made up within a three day window of the original survey date (i.e., 28 days ± 3 days). 
That gives you a seven day window for completing the missed survey.  
Q: How many photos should be taken at each survey?  
A: Taking a photo of the entire site from the beginning and end points at each survey is a good way 
to visually capture changes in shoreline topography and other characteristics that may affect debris 
deposition. You may also want to take a photo of each individual transect. In addition, please take 
photos of interesting, unidentifiable, or fouled debris (organisms growing on or attached to debris).  
Q: How do I keep track of the date on which photos were taken?  
A: You should download the photos to your computer following each survey. Change the filename of 
the photos to include a date, location, and photo # (e.g., 06-10-2012_LongBeach#01.jpg). You can 
also write comments about the photos you’ve taken in the notes section of the data sheet.  
Q: My GPS is giving me lat/longs in the wrong format, how do I change it to decimal degrees? 
A: The lat/long units can be usually be changed in the general settings of the GPS. There are also 
many online tools to convert between units. 
Shoreline Characteri
zation 
Q: If my shoreline is greater than six meters wide, I need to record GPS coordinates at all four 
corners of survey site. How do I take GPS coordinates at the water’s edge when waves are washing 
in and out?  
A: When you conduct your initial shoreline characterization it is important to arrive at the site at low 
tide so that you can capture the entire width of the beach. In order to record GPS readings at the 
water’s edge, watch the breaking waves to try to determine the shoreward extent of the water. Record 
coordinates at that point. If a portion of the shorelin e site is underwater at subsequent surveys do not 
try to enter the water to survey. Only survey the exposed area of the shoreline. 
Q: How do I determine the tidal distance?  
A: Tidal distance is the horizontal distance on the beach between the average low and high tide lines. 
Arrive at your site at low tide and measure the distance from the water’s edge to the high tide wrack 
line. This measurement is different from the total wi dth of the shoreline, which is measured from the 
waters’ edge to the back barrier. 
Q: My shoreline site is longer than 100 m. How do I select a 100 m segment?  
A: Select your 100 m segment based on areas with relatively low public usage, little evidence of 
debris from day use (picnic debris), and areas that  are not immediately adjacent to an obstruction to 
nearshore circulation (e.g., breakwater, point of land). Also consider landmarks or permanent 
features to assist in returning to the same segment at future dates. You may want to consider 
randomly selecting multiple 100 m segments within a larger shoreline site. 
Q: How do I determine the back of the shoreline? 
A: The back of the shoreline is defined here as the first major change in substrate, which may be a 
vegetation line, cliff, or other barrier. If you are interested in also monitoring debris that may be 80 
 pushed back into vegetation behind the beach during storms, that debris should be tallied on a 
separate data sheet so that it's not included in the calculated debris standing-stocks. Data entered into 
the NOAA database should only reflect the debris to the first change in substrate. If the back of the 
shoreline is only a partial barrier, for example a patch of vegetation behind which there is more 
beach, then survey up to the first continuous barrier (include that vegetation patch and the area 
behind it). In some cases, shoreline sites may be too complex to clearly delineate a maximum landward limit where debris might be deposited. These ty pes of sites, and shorelines that are very 
high energy or dominated by sedimentary deposits, may not be good shoreline survey candidates. For 
the same reason, barrier islands and other shifting substrates are not likely to be ideal survey 
locations.  
 
Survey Protocols 
Q: I found an item of debris smaller than 2.5 cm in the longest dimension. Why can’t I record it on 
the data sheet?  
A: The 2.5 cm size cutoff (about the size of a bottle cap ) is used as a standard metric because it is the 
smallest size that can reliably and consistently be detected with the human eye.  
 
Q: I found an item that could become a large item (> 30 cm) if it became unraveled / unwound. How 
should I record it? 
A: Items should be recorded according to how they’re found at the time of the survey. For example, 
if a circular strap or band is found enclosed and is < 30 cm in all dimensions it should be recorded as 
a regular-sized item, but if it is opened / detached and is longer than 30 cm, it should be recorded as a 
large item. 
 
Q: Do surveys always need to be conducted at low tide?  
A: The NOAA protocols ask for surveys to be conducted at low tide so that the entire area where 
debris may be deposited is surveyed. However, in some areas where tidal ranges are measured in 
10’s of meters, it may not be practical to survey at low tide when large mud flats or wave-cut 
platforms are exposed. If it becomes apparent that the vast majority of debris in the intertidal is ultimately pushed up to the high tide wrack line, surveyors may decide that it is valid to survey at 
times outside of the suggested window. However, this decision should be made carefully, backed up 
with data, and revisited on a regular basis.  
 
Q: Why do we need to measure beach width at every survey?  
A: Knowing the width of the shoreline allows NOAA to report debris densities in units of # of items 
per square meter of shoreline. NOAA asks for the sh oreline width at each survey in order to evaluate 
the variability in shoreline width over the course of  the project. Ideally, you could note the shoreline 
width at the average lowest tide of the day (tidal height 0’ according to tide tables or graphs), referred 
to as Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW, more information available at: http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datum_options.html ). 
 
Q: How do you record the width of the site if the back of the shoreline is not parallel to the water 
(e.g., a U-shaped site)?  
A: If the shoreline site is irregularly shaped, you will need to measure the width in a few different 
places in order to get an accurate estimate of total shoreline area. Please sketch the shape of the site 
in the data sheet notes section. Break the shoreline into a series of rectangles and measure the length 
and width of each. This does not need to be done at every survey.  
 81 Q: What should I do if I cannot determine the debris material type?  
A: If you don’t know whether an item is rubber, plastic, metal, etc., record it under “other”, provide a 
description, and take photos.  
Q: I found a piece of natural driftwood. Should I record this on the survey sheet? 
A: No. Natural woody debris does not fall under the official definition of marine debris. Only 
processed or treated lumber should be recorded. 
Q: I found an item that is coated in one material type, and composed of another. How do I record it? 
A: Items should be recorded according to the primary material type on the surface of the item. 
Q: I found multiple pieces of a larger piece of debris. Should I record it as one item or multiple 
items?  
A: Record the item in the condition you found it. If the item was broken when you found it, record each piece separately. If it broke while you were examining it, record the debris as one item only. 
Q: There is debris beyond the first barrier or chang e in substrate at the back of the shoreline. Can I 
record those items?  
A: Items located beyond the first barrier can be noted and described in the notes section of the data 
sheet (or on a separate data sheet), but this data should be compiled separately from the shoreline 
debris data. 
Q: What should I do if I find debris fouled with what might be invasive species?  
A: If you suspect that you may have found debris w ith invasive species, please take clear photos of 
the item, attached organism, and any identifying marks on the object. Remove the item from the 
water or shoreline and place on dry land well above the high tide line. You may want to contact local 
taxonomic experts listed at http://www.anstaskforce.gov/Tsunami.html . In your report note the 
current location of the item. 
Q: What should I do if I find a piece of hazardous debris?  
A: If you encounter hazardous items such as oil or chemical drums, contact your local authorities (a 
911 call), state environmental health agency, and the National Response Center 1-800-424-8802. 
Provide as much information as possible so the authorities can determine how to respond. 
Q: What should I do if I find a derelict vessel or other large object that may become a hazard to 
navigation?  
A: Contact your local authorities (a 911 call), state environmental health agency, and the U.S. Coast 
Guard Pacific Area Command at 510-437-3701. Provide as much information as possible so the 
authorities can determine how to respond. 
Q: What should I do if I find an item that may be a valuable or significant memento?  
A: If an item has unique identifiers and may be traceable to an individual or group, please take 
photos and report the item to DisasterDebris@noaa.gov (note that the item was found during a 
monitoring survey). Use your best judgment to determine what may or may not be valuable.  
Q: I am completing standing-stock surveys. Why do I need to take GPS coordinates of all four 
transects at every survey?  
A: Taking GPS coordinates of each transect helps NOAA to track the location of transects and to 
ensure that the survey site location is not changing over time (due to moving landmarks or shifting 82 beach dynamics). Additionally, it helps to ensure th at site start/end points are located correctly and 
that equipment is functioning properly. 
Q: I am completing standing-stock surveys, and at multiple surveys I have been encountering the 
same item. Should I tally this item at each sur vey (assuming it is in one of the random transects)?  
A: Yes! This is part of the reason that standing-stock surveys are informative. They provide 
information on the density of debris on the shoreline and how it changes over time. Debris that 
remains on the shoreline for long periods of time is part of the “standing-stock.” The persistence of 
the item can be noted in the notes section of the data sheet. 
Data Entry and Submission 
Q: How do I get access to the NOAA MD-MAP database?  
A: Send an email to MD.monitoring@noaa.gov for questions about the database or to request a login. 
Q: How often should I upload data to the NOAA MD-MAP database?  
A: Please enter data into MD-MAP as soon as possible after each survey to ensure that data is entered accurately. Penny Pritzker
