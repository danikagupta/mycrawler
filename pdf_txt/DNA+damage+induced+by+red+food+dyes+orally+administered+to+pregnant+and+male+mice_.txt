ABSTRACT  
Cancer is a big scary C word used  to describe the malignant, 
autonomous growth of cells that have undergone epigenet ic changes 
and genetic mutations and thus escaped normal cell cycle and 
displayed various degrees of similarities to their prec ursors  due to 
various chemical , physical and  biological carcinogenic agents . In 2014 
the World Cancer Society reports that secon d largest and the leading 
cause  of morbi dity and mortality worldwide is  cancer. Approximately 
14 million people were reported to suffer from cancer and 8.2 million 
cancer related deaths in 2012. This number  is anticipated  to rise by 
about 70% over the next 2 decades.  Nowadays Food additives , which 
can be potential carcinogenic agents, are used injudiciously  in excess 
in commercial food production and ho usehold  cooking  to make food 
more attractive, appealing, appetizing, and informative . This can lead  
to ser ious health problems causing cancer by, -a negative synergistic effect when combined 
with oth er additives, -improper storage Conditions , and -unknown carcinogenic by -products 
occurring during the food processing.  The regulation regarding the production a nd marketing 
of food additive s should be strictly monitored for minimum adverse effects on health 
although the legal limits of these additives in processed foods are well respected by the 
manufacturers.

INTRODUCTION  
Cancer is a major public health burden in both developed and developing countries.  In 2014 
the Wor ld Cancer Society reports that secon d largest and the leading cause  of morbidity and 
mortalit y worldwide is  cancer. Among  men, the 5 most common sites of cancer diagnosed in 
2012 were lung, prostate, colorectum, stomach, and liver. The incidence of b reast cancer,[1] 
which is most common in women ,is highest in Pakistan as compare d to South -Central Asian 
countries.[2] 
  
Food additive s are used both in commercial food production and in domestic cooking  to 
preserve  flavor  or enhance its taste,  appearance, or other qualities.  They are of various 
catego ries: acidulents ( citric acid and vinegar) , acidity  regulators , anticaking agen ts (milk 
powder) , antifoaming ag ents, antioxidants (Vitamin C), coloring agents, color retention 
agents , bulking agents, flavor, flavor enhancer , preserv atives, sweetener, tracer gas , 
stabilizers etc .  
 
Food additives As Carcinogenic Agent  
Out of 12000 sub stances , More than 2,500 chemical substances are intentionally added to 
foods to enhance  flavor, color, stability, texture,  or cost and rests , including components of 
food-packaging materials, processing aids, pesticide residues, and drugs given to animals , are 
unintentionally added.[3] The additives, scientifically and officially proven as safe , are 
authorized to be used in the food sector  after being subjected to toxicological studies for their 
safety evaluation. Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) levels of fo od additives for human are 
derived from their  No-Observed -Adverse -Effects -Level ( NOAEL ), which  has been long 
determined on the basis of toxicological studies  and their legal limits are then established  for 
the food products.  However, recent studies demonst rated that consumption of some processed 
food containing certain food additives increases  the risk of cancer in human although the 
legal limits of these additives in processed foods are well respected by the manufacturers. 
Possible reasons for increased ca rcinogenicity risk in processed foods containing these 
additives can be due to various factors: -interaction of additives with some food ingredients, -
food processing may change the chemical formula of food additive to a formula to be acting 
similarly as c arcinogenic compound, -a negative synergistic effects when combined with 
other additives, -improper storage conditions, and -unknown carcinogenic by -products 
occurring during the food processing.

Possible causes of  carcinogenicity by food additive   
1) When food additives come  in contact with other food ingredients  in food products , their 
chemical structure changes during physical, ch emical and enzymatic processing : For 
instance, nitrates and nitrites are converted to nitrosamines in meat products.  
 
2) Various food additives  show  negative synergistic  effects by interacting among themselves  
producing  carcinogenicity  : For instance, the additives of potassium sorbate, ascorbic acid 
and ferric or ferrous salts have the potential  to cause mutagenicity and DN A-damaging 
activity, when all combined together, but not when used separately.  
 
3) Interacting  with other carcinogenic by products in commercial additives , can induce 
carcinogenicity  For example , some undesirable by -products s uch as 4 -Methylimidazole is 
also formed during the production of caramels when ammonium is used.  
 
4) Improper and longer storage condition s Benzoates (benzoic acid, sodium benzoate, 
potassium benzoate, and calcium benzoate) are typical examples.  
 
5) Exceeding safe limits  beyond the pro vision of  a maximum amount that can be added into 
foods according to these ADI  (Acceptable Daily Intake ) levels.

CONCLUSION  
Monitoring  and surveillance  of processed foods containing certain food additives, which have 
a negli gible probability of  carcinogenicity in legal limits, must be s trengthened from the point 
of view regarding public health concerns.  Therefore, this review will provide a concise piece 
of information for reader s as well as researcher s about possible risk of carcinogenicity caused 
by food additive s. Finally  it is recomm ended that an additive, intentionally added to the food 
during processing must be detected  officially for its carcinogenicity.
