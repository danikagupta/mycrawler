1. Introduction
Whiterotfungiareorganismsabletoe⁄cientlyminer-
alizelignin.Theenzymesinvolvedinthe¢rststepsofthe
process are at least three: lignin peroxidase (LiP) [1,2],
manganese-dependentperoxidase(MnP) [3,4]andlaccase.
LiP is a heme protein with high oxidation potential, this
enzyme can oxidize phenolic and non-phenolic substrates[5^8]. MnP oxidizes Mn
2þto Mn3þ, which binds to che-
lators secreted by the fungus and then oxidizes a wide
range of substrates [9]. Laccase belongs to a family of
multicopper oxidases, which oxidize preferentially phe-
nolic lignin dimers [10]. Laccase is able to oxidize lignin
model compounds if appropriate redox mediators like2,2P-azinobis(ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonicacid)(ABTS),
1-hydroxybenzotriazole(1-HBT) [11],orvioluricacid[12]
are present. In these conditions laccase can oxidize sub-strates that were formerly restrictive to LiP activity, like
veratryl alcohol [11]or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs)[13,14].Rarelyarethesethreeenzymespresentin
the same organism, and di¡erent combinations of themcanoperate.
White rot fungi have been demonstrated to be capable
oftransformingandmineralizingawiderangeoforgano-pollutants,andligninaseshavebeenimplicatedinthispro-
cess[15]. Pointing[16]listed the diversity of known sub-
strate compounds that were shown to be degraded bywhite rot fungi, among them polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs),PAHs,pentachlorophenol,organochlorines,orga-
nophosphates and synthetic dyes (including those of azo,triphenylmethane orheterocyclic/polymericstructure).
Malachite green (MG) is a triphenylmethane dye used
as a fungicide and antiseptic in ¢sh cultures (The MerckIndex,12thedition),itshightoxicitytobacteriaandmam-
malian cells was also demonstrated [17]. It promotes ma-
lignant cell formation in hamster embryos by decreasingthesensitivitytoapoptosis [18].Becauseofthetoxicityof
MG to major microorganisms, and the health hazard to
humans,organismsabletogrowinthepresenceofthedyeand able to degrade it are of particular importance. In
previous reports the production of laccase and MnP by
Fomes sclerodermeus was shown[19,20]. The objective of
this work was to evaluate the toxicity of MG to F. scle-

particular focused on laccase activity. The toxicity of the
colorless reaction products, in this work named decolor-

arcticusBAFC 266,P. chrysosporium BAFC 246,Pleuro-
tus lindquistii BAFC 2102, Spongipellis ¢ssilis BAFC 170,
Trametes extenuata BAFC 270, all of them belonging to
theculturecollectionoftheFacultyofExactandNatural
Sciences (University of Buenos Aires), were used in these
experiments. Stock cultures were maintained on malt ex-tract (1.2%) agar(2%) slants at4‡C.
2.2. Basal culturemedium
Basal solid medium (MEA) was 2% agar, 1.2% malt
extract, glucose 1% and basal liquid medium (MEL) was1.2%maltextract,glucose1%.FinalpH:5.6.Anaqueous
solution of MG 10 mM was prepared and maintained as
stock and it was added to reach the concentrations indi-cated in the ¢gures. Agar plates with 20 ml of medium
were inoculated with a 0.25-cm
2agar plug cut from the
advancingmarginofa5-day-oldcolonygrownonMEA.Incubation was carried out at 28‡C (liquid cultures were
incubated under static conditions). Radial growth was
measured in two perpendicular directions from the edgeof the inoculum to the advancing margin of the colony.

2.3. Enzymesourceand assays
To obtain the enzymatic crude, F. sclerodermeus was
cultivatedinde¢nedliquidmediumcontaining(perliter):
glucose 15 g; MgSO
4W7H2O, 0.5 g; KH 2PO4, 0.5 g;
K2HPO4, 0.6 g; CuSO 4W5H2O, 0.5 g; H 3BO3, 0.07 mg;
Na2MoO4W2H2O, 0.02 mg; FeCl 3, 1 mg; ZnCl 2, 3.5 mg;
thiaminehydrochloride,0.1mg;asparaginemonohydrate,6g.FinalpHwas6.4.Erlenmeyer£askswereincubatedat
28‡C under static conditions. All chemicals were of ana-
lyticalgradeandusedwithoutfurtherpuri¢cation.
At12dayspostinoculationthecultureswereharvested,
¢ltered and the supernatants were used as the enzyme
source. Under these conditions MnP and LiP were notdetectedinthesupernatants.Allenzymesweredeterminedspectrophotometricallyat30‡Cinatotalvolumeof1ml.

2.4. Decolorizationanddetoxi¢cationassays
Thereactionswerecarriedoutat30‡C.Thedecoloriza-
tionofMGwasmonitoredspectrophotometricallyat618
nm[23]and the values were expressed as At/A0where:
At=absorbance at time tandA0=absorbance at time 0.
The reaction mixture for decolorization experiments con-
tainedMG32 WMand1-HBT10,2.5and1.25mM.The
reaction was carried out in sodium acetate bu¡er 50mM
pH3.5,and1(with1-HBT)or10(without1-HBT)Uof
laccase in a total volume of 3 ml. For the detoxi¢cationassays, 0.02, 0.1 and 0.4 mM MG was incubated in so-
dium acetate bu¡er pH 3.5, 5 mM 1-HBT and 1 U of
laccase activity in a total volume of 2 ml. After a decol-orizationofatleast95%,thecontentofthereactiontube
was mixed with 18 ml of MEA or MEL medium. The
absorbances were measured in samples diluted in thesame bu¡er. Reaction tubes with the same mixture but
without MG were the controls. To determine the toxicity
ofDMG,theplatesorErlenmeyer£askscontainingMEAorMELmediumwith2,10and40 WMDMGwereinoc-

Both fungi cultured in liquid media ( Fig. 2) showed
higher sensitivity to the concentration of the toxin than
that observed in plates. Growth of P. chrysosporium was
a¡ectedat4 WMwhileF.sclerodermeus wasmoreresistant
and a concentration of 16 WM was necessary in order to
observe a delay in the growth (1-HBT at 5 mM was not
toxicto anyfungustested).

meus. There were no signi¢cant di¡erences in the laccase
production by F. sclerodermeus in MG-amended media
compared to that obtained in basal culture medium. The

PlatescontainingbasalculturemediamixedwithDMG
from reaction tubes both containing and not containing
1-HBT(2,10and40 WMDMG¢nalconcentration)were
non-toxic for P. chrysosporium (Fig. 4). The fungus
showed a growth kinetics similar to that observed in
MEA (Fig. 1a). This fungus cultured in liquid DMG-
amended medium showed the same kinetics of biomassproduction as that observed in the control medium
(Fig.2a).
The toxicity of MG and DMG was assessed in other
white rot fungi ( Table 1). Results were very similar to
those observed in P. chrysosporium , except forC. versi-
color, which showed similar delayed values of radial
growthinthepresenceofMG orDMG.4. Discussion
Thetoleranceof F.sclerodermeus andP.chrysosporium
to MG was assessed across various concentrations of thedye. In solid medium, growth of P. chrysosporium was
a¡ectedatconcentrationsof32 WMandbelowandaslow-
ergrowthratethanthecontrolwasobserved,64 WMwas
completelyinhibitory.Thefasterdi¡usionoftheenzymes
in liquid media compared to that in plates explains the
di¡erences observed in tolerance to the fungicide in bothfungi.
AlthoughP. chrysosporium has the enzymatic machin-
erytodegradethelignin,itexhibitedverylowtolerancetothe dye. Likely, the fact that this fungus produces ligni-
nasesinidiophasicculturescouldbeacontributiontothe
delay in the growth and delayed halo in plates in thepresence of the toxic. By contrast, F. sclerodermeus pro-
duces laccase and MnP in trophophasic cultures [24].O n
theotherhand,previousreportsshowedthatthenon-lig-ninolyticfungus Cunninghamellaelegans wasabletogrow
in the presence of MG at a concentration of 81 WM[23].
Therefore,possessingtheligninolyticenzymesisnotsu⁄-cienttotolerate toxiccompoundsthatcouldbedegraded
anddetoxi¢edbytheseenzymes,thephysiologicalstatein
whichtheyaresecretedbeingimportant.Conversely,non-ligninolyticfungiwereabletogrowinthepresenceofMG
and it was suggested that cytochrome P450 could be in-
volved inthemodi¢cationof thedye [23].
The shift in the absorbance maximum (618 to 610 nm)
in the presence of 1-HBT is in agreement with previous
results where it was proposed that the shift was due toN-demethylationreactions [23].Inthecaseofthereaction
withoutthemediatortheabsorbanceat618nmdecreased,
while an increase was observed at 445 nm. This could bedue to a di¡erence in the mechanism of action of laccase
inthepresenceofthemediator,asitwasdemonstratedfor
laccases from Trametes versicolor [11]. The precipitate
formed in the reaction tubes in the presence or absence
of 1-HBT could be caused by the polymerization of the
dye units. Leaving the mixture reaction overnight led tothe formation of a dark precipitate suggesting that the
productsarefurtheroxidized,possiblyleadingtothefor-
mation of dimers or higher oligomers. These results sug-gest that at least two reactions could occur to MG and
thatthesemodi¢cationsrenderthedyelesstoxictoother
whiterotfungi,whichinturncoulddegradetheproductsofthesereactions.Similarresultswereobservedwithferul-

the ability of F. sclerodermeus to detoxify MG by two
possible pathways. The fungus was not only able togrow in the presence of high concentrations of MG, but
it was also able to decolorize and detoxify the dye. MG
treated with supernatants containing high laccase activitywith or without the addition of 1-HBT gave a colorless
substance (DMG), which was not toxic to P. chrysospo-
riumalongwithotherwhite rotfungi.
