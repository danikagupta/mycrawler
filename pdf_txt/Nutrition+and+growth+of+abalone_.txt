ABSTRACT  
 This study aims to analyze the biological aspects of tropical abalone (Haliotis asinina L) comprising 
distribution of abalone size, length and weight correlation and feeding habit . The study was conducted  in 
Tanakeke Island waters, Takalar regency, South Sulawesi. The selection of station for samples was based 
on dissemination of coral  reefs around  the islands. The data were collected  through a survey, and 
analyzed qualitativel y. The results  of the study indicated that the size distribution of male abalone shell 
length is 32.00 – 89.00 mm and body weight  is  2.90 – 94.52 g. The female shell length is 3.00 -81.00 mm 
and body weight is 3.72 -123.53 g. The shell length of most of male caught abalone is 50.00 -55.00 mm, 
and 60,00 -65.00 mm for  female abalone. The correlation between shell  length and body weight  for both 
male and female abalones is isometric. Abalone is herbivorous feeding on benthic diatom and red algae.  
 Keywords : biological aspects, length and weight correlation, isometric, herbivorous feeding.

INTRODUCTION  
Abalone (Haliotis asinina) is a kind of gastropoda. The shape is almost like ea r, so why it is called ‘donkey 
ear’. Abalone H. asinina is an export commodity. The price is about Rp. 1000.000/kg. This king of seafood 
is a favorite food of people of Japan, United States of America, Europe, Columbia and Canada, because 
the meat is  very  delicious.  100 g of abalones meat comprises 83 calories, 59 mg cholesterol  (low 
cholesterol), 18 g protein, 0,1 g fat, 2,7 carbohidrate, and some vitamins  such  as B1, B2, B6 and B16 and 
also comprises of some minerals such as calcium, iron,  zink, mag necium, and celenium (Setyono, 2009).  
The high demand of  market causes the population of abalones are  exploited more and more, so they are 
getting less and less in some exploitation area. Before the exploitation, abalones were easily be found in 
some cer tain area, but now it is difficult to find them and the location of catching the abalones is also  
deeper (Maliao et. al.,2004).  
Beside that, the way of catching abalones is usually done by turning  the coral reef over. This is the way 
to take the abalones  which hiding in the bottom of coral reef. As a result. It destroys the coral reefs 
(destructive fishing).  
One way to save the population of abalones is to do cultivation.  The cultivation of abalones can be done 
if the germ is available continuously.  The  way to get the abalone germ continuously can be done by 
producing the germ. The producing of abalone can be done successfully if both the quality and the  
quantity of abalones’ mother can be recognized from biological aspect.  
One of the potential areas to  produce local mother of abalone is Tanakeke islands. The island is part of 
Spermonde islands where the abalones were caught. These islands consist of some islands i.e. Tanakeke 
island, Lantang Pao island, Bauluang island and Satangnga island. Beside that,  around the islands there 
are atols where many coral reefs grow in (Yunus, 2009).  
One of the problems of abalones cultivation is the available of their local mother. That is why   the 
information of the available and the potency of the local mother are nee ded as the source mother of 
abalones cultivation in South Sulawesi. In accordance with it, the analysis of biological aspects of abalones 
becomes important. The potency can be developed, when  these things are known; (a). what is the length 
and weight of t he catching abalones, (b). the correlation of their length and weight, and (c). how is their 
feeding habit in nature.

METHOD OF RESEARCH  
This study was done by using survey method. The abalones were caught around the locati on of Tanakeke 
islands waters, Mangarabombang sub district, Takalar regency on the center 05O 29 10,9 LS and 119 O 
18’ 54.6”BT. The taken station was chosen  based  on the spread of coral reef found around the islands. 
The time of sampling was conducted in  the second week every month. The sample was taken for one year, 
started from April 2008 to March 2009. The biological parameter was searched in Biological fishery 
laboratory Faculty of marine science and fishery Hasanuddin University.  There were 60 sampl es of 
abalone were used  in various size for feedIng habit analysis.  
a. The correlation of the length -weight.  In gaining the data it was used formula (Ricker 1975 in Schiel and 
Breen, 1991)  
W = aL  b  
W = body weight (g). L = total length, a and  b constant b. Feeding Habit, to analyze the caught abalones 
feeding, it was used action frequency method.  
DISCUSSION  
The Distribution of the Shell Length and the Body Weight  
The distribution of abalone’s shell length and the body weight described  the spe cific biometric parameter 
in the production period. The finding was based on the survey  started from April 2008 to  March 2009. It 
was found 296 samples, consist of 167 male abalones (56,42%) and 129 female abalones (43.58%). The  
shell  lengths of male a balones were about 32.00 to 89.00 mm  and the weight were  about 2.90 to 94.52 
g. The shell lengths of female abalones were about 30.00 to  81.00 mm and  the weight were about 3.72 
to 123.53 g.  
Based on the shell length, the frequency of the caught abalone s at the   time when the abalones were 
caught as the sample was given on picture 1 and 2. Based on picture 2, it can be said that on April 2008 
the caught abalones were  45 -50 mm length of shell (16%), and  most of their shell length were 50 -55mm  
(36%). O n May 2008 the length of the caught abalones were 50 -55 mm (3,85%)  most of them were 60 -
65 mm (50%) On June 2008 they started to show the  addition of new population. The indication  was 
shown when there was a small size of abalone H. Asinina that  is 30 -35 shell length (8%)  and there was 
also found big  size of abalone, that  is  80 -85 mm (4%) of  length. The size of the abalone grew bigger  
  351Proceeding of International Seminar on Indonesian Fisheries Development 2010  
on July 2008, that  is 45 -50 mm length (6,25%). The general size was 65 -70 mm  length (43,75%). On this 
month there were found many of the abalones are gonad mature.   
Figure 1. Picture of shell abalone H asinina in other size  
 
 
Next, on August 2008, there were caught various abalones a nd this was also happened on September and 
October 2008. However, on November 2008  it was found again the recruitment or the addition of new 
members in the waters. This was indicated when there was found 35 -40 mm length even though only in 
small  amount ( 4,35%).  
It was also happened on March of the next year. When there were found  small abalone with 30 -35 mm 
of shell length (3,3%) The  abalone was assumed as a result of spawning from October last year, in which 
it was the culminating point of abalones spa wning. Nash (1992) stated that the successful recruitment  
rarely happened and sometime the recruitment in some years are not enough to support fishery. The 
survey to the distribution of abalones shell length shows that the size of male abalones came from group 
50-55 mm shell length. Whereas, female  abalones came from 60 -65 mm length group (picture 3).  
The amount of female abalones with 60 -65 shell length then correlates to the level of gonad mature shows 
that the size of these abalones started to be matur e  and some of  them  started  to be gonad  mature. 
The population of the structure of this size are bigger in nature, because in this period  the addition of 
shell length got  down. This is the longest period in Abalone live cycles. The statement is in li ne with 
Bardos’ et.al (2006).

Figure 2. PDistribution of abalone’s shell length periode April 2008 to March 2009  
The smallest amount of the catching abalones (less than 5%) were from  under 40 mm and upper 80 mm 
shell le ngth group. This is because the improvement of shell length size and some factors. One of the 
factors, the abalones started  to be in reproduction age,because they got older, beside the death of 
abalones caused by disease or catching activity. This in line  with Bardos’ et. al (2006) who stated that  the 
proportion of mature abalones H. Asinina in nature is getting less and less  because the natural death and 
because they were caught.  
The small abalones with less than 40 mm shell length were also found in ve ry small amount. This is because 
at the time of juvenile, the abalones were competed for food, beside the environment factor. This is in 
accordance with  Lafferty and Kuris (1993)   who stated that the causes of abalones mortality in California 
was caused by disease, water temperature, over exploitation, pollution, physiological pressure,   
353 Proceeding of International Seminar on Indonesian Fisheries Development 2010  
starvation and competition. This statement is in accordance with Bardos et. al (2006) an d Griffith and 
Gosselin (2008) who reported that the main cause of death of invertebrate in the sea in the time of 
juvenile was caused by the high amount of predator, environment factors and the high of juvenile density 
in one habitat. Beside that the move ment of abalones with 40mm and less are friskier than the old one.( 
Mc.Shane , 1992). The presentation of distribution of  abalones H. Laevigata and H. Roel shell length size 
had been measured by using video in Western Australia. It was found that the abal ones with < 30mm shell 
length are 5%, 30 -39 mm (7 %), 40 -49 mm (15%) 50 -59 mm (23%) 60 -69mm (27%), 70 -79 mm (20%) and 
80> (4%) (Hart et.al, 2008).  
 
Figure 3. Histogram presentation of Abalone based on the shell length and kind of    gender during the 
surv ey (N=296)  
The presentation and distribution of abalones size based on its body  weight found during the survey, is 
given on picture 4. Male abalones with 12.1 -22 g weight group were the biggest amount, whereas female 
abalones with 22.1 -32g weight group. The smallest amount were from 62.1 g and up weight group.  
Andy Omar at. al (2006)  found about 30 -55mm shell length and 20 -25 mm  wide  and   6 -9 mm high in 
Bone Tambu Island waters. If we compare the  abalones of this island to the abalones of Tanakeke , it was 
found that abalones of Bone Tambu island was bigger. Maliao at al (2004) also found small tropical  
abalones (H.Asinina) in Sagai Waters of Philipines. The difference size bring us to the conclusion that even 
though  the statistic of abalones show s the smaller size, but  the abalones in Tanakeke were bigger than 
the abalones from South Lombok and from  
 
 
 
354 Aquaculture and Management  
Sagay Philippines waters. This is because some factors such as environment factor, in which it is known 
that the c oral reef in this waters are still good (Yunus,2009). According to Chen (2007) abalones will grow 
successfully if the food are available in nature.  
 
Figure 4. Histogram presentation of Abalones based on weight group and gender     during the 
presentation  (N=296)  
The mean of abalones shell length  and weight which are found during the survey showed  the variation  
in every month. The longest  abalone shell was  found on August and September 2008, both male and 
female abalones. The smallest male abalone  wa s caught on November 2008 and the smallest female one 
was  caught on February 2009. The mean of the biggest body of male and female abalone   were found on 
July 2008. Whereas,  the smallest male abalone was caught on  November 2008 and the smallest female 
one was caught on February 2009.  
The Correlation of Body Weight and Shell Length  
The analysis of correlation of body weight and shell length during the survey  can be seen on table 8. Based 
on the analysis, it was found the  similarities between  the corre lation of male abalone body weight and 
the shell length i.e.  BW= 0.000104PC3.05557, r = 0.9040 (picture 5). For female abalones it was found  
BW = 0,000145PC2.9991, r = 0,8691 (picture 6).

Figure 6. The correlation of body weight and shell length of female Tropical   Abalone     H. asinina.  
The correlation of shell le ngth and body weight of male and female  abalones  shows  the isometric 
correlation. The result of statistic test does not  show  the difference of regression point (b) with 3. It 
means that the weight of most of the found samples getting better as their s hell grown long.  
There is strong correlation of shell length and body weight. It shows  with coefficient value, each 0.9040 
for male abalones and 0.8691 for the female  
  
356 Aquaculture and Management  
ones. Based on the t -test to the coefficient regressio n, it was found different result  between the 
regression of male and female abalones.  
The value of regression (b) found on the survey each 3.0557 for male  abalones and 2.991 for the female 
ones. From the information, it can be known that the addition of s hell length and weight goes  in the same 
time.  
Based on picture 5 and 6, it can be said that  in 30 -60mm length of male  and female abalones curve shows 
the same trend. However, as the shell length grew longer it began to show the difference, in which the  
weight of female  abalones grew bigger than the addition of their shell length. It was happed  because 
when the abalones  get mature gonad, the weight of the gonad were added 10 -25 % from their body 
weight. The addition of gonad weight at the spawn time  was caused by the addition of oosit size in the 
same time with the heap of  nutrient in the process of  getting mature. The composition of ‘karkas’ 
especially fat was saved  as nutrition source  which will be used as the development of embryo

the heighten of total fat an d protein in abalones’ eggs, and this value got bigger  at the second time of   
than at the first time of  spawn.  Maliao et. al (2004)  found  in Philippines the correlation of coefficient  
of the  Abalones H. Asini na body weight and the shell length was 0.833. The regression  value were not 
very different than the abalones found in Baja shore waters in

California.( Del Proo, 19992) who found regression point value (b) 3.43 for H. Fulgens kind; 3.03 for H. 
Corrugata kind and 3.02 for H. Rufencens kind.  
Feeding Habit  
The abalones H. Asinina  feeding habit was analyzed by using frequency of occurance. The result of the 
analysis shows th at as a whole, in the flank of  Abalones H. Asinina they can be differentiated on 
fitoplankton and zooplankton group.  (Table 1).  Fitoplankton group consist of Bacillariophyceae, 
Rhizosoleniales, Acnanthales, Prasinophyceae, and Phyrophyceae group of  zoo plankton are in 
Dinophyceae, and Chroobacteria class. Kind of food found  in Abalon H. Asinina digestion during the 
survey, can be seen  in Table 2.

358 Aquaculture and Management  
Table 1 shows Bacillariophyceae is the most kind of food in abalones digestion, that is 58,33% followed by 
15%  of  Dinophyceae and about 11,67% Algae fiber, and only 10% of others kind o f food. Based on what 
was found in Abalones’ digestion  organ, it clearly shows that the abalones is plankton eater, especially 
bentik diatom, sub kind of fitoplankton from Bacillariophyceae class. Beside that, it was also found any 
fiber that assumed as a ny red algae fiber. In accordance with this, Hahn  (1989 d)  stated that  
Bacillariophyceae is the main food for abalones. Bautista -Teruel et al. (2003) further explained the juvenile 
of tropical abalones H.asinina the high protein source is needed. The hi gh protein can be found from 
Spirulina sp and meat. Singhagraiwan and Doi (1992) found that  Bacillariophyceae is good food for the 
growth of abalones’ mother gonad.  
The finding of  Dinophyceae and Chroobacteria group in abalones digestion organ indicates  that even 
though abalone is herbivore, they also consume a little of  animal on the shell reef surface. This is 
supported by Bautista -Teruel et. al (2003) that abalones need animal protein as at the cultivation time of 
abalones juvenile. This way will res ult quickly growth.  
Based on the experiment result  and  Shepered and Steinberg opinion (1992) kind of H. Laevigata  and H. 
rubra abalones  eat more red algae and only a little of  brown algae. They also consume sargassum if there 
is only a little red alga e around  them. Most of Australian abalones consumes more red algae than brown 
algae. According to Effendi and Patadjai (2009) some of diatomic spawn  from  Bacillariophyceae such as 
Navicula,Nitzchia, Coconeis, Crustose and Corraline Algae are be able to defend the growth of abalones 
larva.  
The comparison of survey finding shows that the main food of abalones is filatoplankton that is litophyta 
(diatomic spawn)  which grow on the surface of strong coral. Based on the habitat and the way of abalones 
live, i t can be seen abalones is a kind of  Makrozoobentas , means they live and adhering on the coral 
surface.  Abalones meve with one organ, that is foot to go along the coral surface  or strong stone to find 
food. Tropical Abalones H. Asinina  take food around  them by scrape using their radula. Appendix 2. Table 
of kind of food found in the caught abalones H. Asinina digestion during the survey. According to Geiger 
(1999)  in Abalone H. Asinina there is a radula or 3 -5 small tooth . The function is to cut the f ood in their 
mouth. When the abalones eat, their mouth adhere to and press the food and their  radula move to scrape  
and tear the food. Abalones eat 10 -30 % of algae of their body weight.(Hahn, 1989)and they   
  359 Proceeding of International Seminar on Indonesian Fisheries Development 2010  
usually  eat in the night (nocturnal) even though is  also possible for them to eat at noon. Abalones ia a 
kind of grouping animal (Hadijah.2007a).  
Their movement is very limited and they rarely move far from their gr oup.  Their movement will get less 
as their shell going long (Mc Shane. 1992). That is why abalones will eat the available food around their 
habitat. If the food around them are enough the abalones will grow quickly. On the contrary, if the food 
are not en ough. They will grow slowly (Andy Omar. 2000 and Setyono, 2009). The abalones will leave their 
live environment if the quantity and the quality of the food  getting less.  Abalones will eat  low nutrition 
food if there is no more food. (Fleming et. al., an d Setyono, 2009).  
Chen (2007) found 12 kinds of bentik diatom that usually consumed by abalone Haliotis diversicolor which 
contains high nutrient  to spur on the growth of  abalones, those are: Nitzchia grossestriata. This is very 
suitable as the adhesion place of larva. Coconies scutellum. Bentik diatom Calonies platycephala  contain 
of  high protein (17,4%), Seminavis Gracilenta contain of high fat (20,3%) and  Cylindrotheca sp contain of 
high  carbohydrate (340,14pg/100m2).  
CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION  
Conc lusion  
The distribution of caught abalones, shell length 32.00 -89.00 mm and body weight 2.90 - 94.52 g for male 
abalones and 30.00 -81mm and 3.72 -123.53 g for  female abalones. The most size of caught abalones were 
in shell length 50 -55 mm  for male abalones  and 60 -65 mm for female abalones.  
a. The correlation of shell length and the body weight of male tropical abalones  and the female ones 
shows isometric correlation.  
b. Abalone is herbivore. The specification  is diatomic spawn and  red algae  eater.  
Sugg estion  
a. For the need of germ is it suggested using male  abalones with 64.50 mm  shell length, and female 
abalones with 64.09 mm shell length.  
b. To save the eternality of Abalone H. Asinina ,  it is suggested that fishermen  should not catch abalones 
under 40 mm length and they should decrease  the intensity of catching at the  peak season.
