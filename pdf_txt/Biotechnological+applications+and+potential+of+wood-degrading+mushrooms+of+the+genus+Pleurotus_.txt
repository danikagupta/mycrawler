INTRODUCTION  
 
Food gives us energy to work and it is basic need for 
human to live. So Food production  is a t op most 
necessity of the world a s food is very important. But 
food should be nutritio us as it has multi dimensional 
effect on the progress of any country . When Shr i Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee's  asserted "Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and Jai 
Vigyan"  definitely their thought behind will be based on 
the de velopment of country in terms of self dependence 
in food production, its strong defense system and its 
scientific achievements .  The slogan demonstrate the 
interconnection between  the role of scientist, hard-work 
of farmers and tough job of soldiers as they are all 
correlated with each other and has important rol e in 
development of any country.  
 
On the Planet Earth food can be synthesized only by 
green plants so p lant kingdom plays very important role  
because only they can fix the CO 2 into glucose , they 
perform oxygenic photosynthesis so able to fix carbon 
dioxide and releases oxygen.  Mushrooms belong to the 
group fungi in Plant Kingdom.  They do not have  the 
chlorophyll so can’t synthesize their food and depends 
for their food  on dead and decayin g organic ma terial . 
Reproductive structures of mushrooms  may be like 
umbrella annulus, Cup volva etc. These beautiful f ruiting 
bodies produce  millions of spores , through which a new 
organism  germinates . The world of mushroom has 
always been fascinating and mystic to m an owing to their 
sudden appearance in number, groups, rings, bunches 
and also in isolation as a single attractive and fascinating 
structure. Mushroom are generally found to grow in 
place where that remains of plants such as leaves, straws, 
logs etc. are d ecaying in forest, fields and meadows, due to its saprophytic nutritional habit, in these habitats 
mushroom grows in abundance.  
 
Mushrooms:  food for Human  
In the post -COVID phase, consumers are much aware 
about their dietary pattern for gaining good immuni ty. 
The era of health conscious consumers has also 
influenced food industries to introduce health food 
according to the demand. Health food may be expressed 
as the nutritious, prevent diseases and maintain health. In 
this concern as a nutritive food mushro oms are good 
choice as they are good in protein. Mushrooms being 
more palatable flavor and tasty have received much 
attention. FAO has also recommended mushroom as 
food contributing to protein nutrition. The trends of 
consumption of cultivated mushrooms ar e rising.  
 
In most ancient literature in Vedas and Bibles, references 
about the mushroom are available . Mushroom were the 
plants of immortality  as per the ancient Egyptians 
believe . Russia, China, Greece Mexico, Latin America 
had rituals about  the people e xpected to gain super 
human strength. In Vikings mythology , this magic 
fungus  considered as  a gift from God , used  to gain their 
fighting frenzy known as Berserk. In Guatemala (100 
B.C.) mushroom shaped stone artifacts have been found . 
The food value of mus hroom also wrote by 
Theophrastus, the great Greek philosopher.  
 
All mushrooms are not edible and some of them are 
highly poisonous too. The toxic species are commonly 
called as  toad stools. Even after so many researches on 
mushroom, t ill date no any proper  test is available to 
distinguish between edible and poisonous mushrooms 
and may be the reason itself mushroom eating could not *Corresponding Author: Dr. Anuradha Sharma Dubey

ABSTRACT  
 
Mushroom belongs to the group fungi. Some of them are poisonous but some are edible. However mushrooms are 
part of table delicacy but there is  need to popularize it as a part of common food. It is also a nutraceutical as it is 
nutritive and medicinal food. Present paper deals with the properties of Pleurotus  spp. mushroom and exploring 
need of its artificial cultivation to reduce its cost.

be popularized . But after its artificial cultivation it 
became more successful  as food . Out of 2, 50,000 species 
of fungi about 2 000 species are considered  as prime 
edible mushrooms but only about a dozen of fungal 
species can be currently produced for food with 
industrial and economic basis (Ramirez et al. 2000).  
During last centuries particularly after the artificial 
cultivation o f white button mushroom i.e. Agaricus  spp. 
in France 1650, it has household popularity in Europe 
and America. Chinese were able to cultivate some other 
mushrooms much before the white button mushroom 
cultivation.  
 
Pleurotus spp. mushroom are gaining more a ttention as 
health food with its number and quality of vitamins, 
minerals, amino acids, trace elements, essential fatty 
acids (Tam et al. 1986, Solomko et al. 1988, Sturion & 
de Camargo 2000 and Mattila et al. 2001).  Pleurotus 
species mushroom are generall y known as oyster and 
locally called as Dhingri. They are easy to grow in 
tropical and subtropical climate where it can be grown all 
round the year.  
 
Nutritive and Medicinal Importance  of Pleurotus spp  
mushroom  
Justo et al. (1998) mentioned Pleurotus mushr oom as 
supplement of food. Pleurotus species mushrooms are 
not only very delicious but very nutritive also .  Pleurotus 
species are having good quality protein and Pleurotus 
proteins are a good complement of cereals , so it is 
considered as nutritive and hea lthy food  (Bano and 
Rajarathnam 1988, Justo  et al. 1998) . There are also 
some f inding s proved that Pleurotus spp is good source 
of all essential amino acids in comparison to common 
vegetables  (Volz 1972 , Mattila et al. 2002) . 
 
It is found to be good source  of vitamin B complex group 
particularly th iamine, niacin and folates (Solomko & 
Eliseeva 1988, Mattila et al 2001)  however Vitamin E 
content was not detected in Pleurotus spp. (Ching & 
Mohamed 2001) . 
 
As compared to other food material Pleurotus spp. have  
low Na and high K in mineral composition that is 
beneficial  for the patients of hypertension  (Tam et al . 
1986, Sturion &  de Camargo 2000). It is rich in P, Zn & 
Cu though  iron i s in low quantity  (Mattila 2001) . Low fat 
content in Pleurotus spp. was observ ed in the studies of 
by Justo et al. (1998) though  it is rich in linoleic  acid 
which is an essential fatty acid for our body . 
 
Cholesterol is the dreaded sterol  for the heart patient , and 
most importantly it  is absent in Pleurotus spp. mushroom 
and even all mushroom , on the place of cholesterol,  
ergosterol is found in mushroom s which could be 
converted to vitamin D by the body  (Ginterova & 
Janotkova 1981)  and have good impact . Presently 
diabetes is the most common disease in India and w ith 
no star ch and v ery low sugar they are delight food for 
diabetic  (Chorvathova et al. 1993) . It is one of the established food sources of vitamins, fats 
and minerals. It is a best alternate protein source  in 
present time . In the comparison of most vegetables, the 
protein c ontent of fresh Pleurotus spp. is almost twice 
(Matilla et al. 2001).  
 
It considered as not only a table delicacy in parting a 
particular aroma to the food but nutritious too (Tam et al. 
1986, Solomko et al. 1988, Justo et al.  1998, Sturion & 
de Camargo 20 00 and Mattila et al.2001).  
 
Tremendous nutrition potentials of Pleurotus  spp. have 
led to several studies on its significant pharmacological 
properties. Its Hypoch olestrolemic effect was reported by 
Bobek et al. (1991a, 1991b), Opletal (1993), Khanna et 
al. (1993), Bobek et al. (1994), Opletal et al. (1997), 
Bajaj et al. (1997), Bobek et al. (1998) and Hossain et al. 
(2003).  
 
Many mushrooms have traditional been used as medicine 
and tonic in China , Japan and Korea. Researchers have 
proved  that species of t he mushroom is  potential 
antifungal (Wang & Ng 2004) . Its antivirus (Wang & Ng 
2000, Zhang et al. 2004) and anti microbial  (Cohen et al. 
2002, Ngai & Ng 2004)  activities were also recorded . 
 
Antitumor activity of it was registered by Yoshioka et al. 
(1975),  Zhuang et al. (1993), Chang (1996), Zhang et al. 
(2001) and Mahajan et al.(2002) . 
 
Choravathova et al. 1993 was recorded Hypoglycemic 
effect of Pleurotus spp. It s immunomodulatory property 
was observed by  Tedesco et al. (1983), Paulik et al. 
(1992) and Ch ang (1996).  Besides Pleurotus spp. also 
has antiplate let aggregation activity (Jose et al. 2004) and 
blood pressure reducing quality  (Tam et al. 1986) . In the 
case of fungal allergy Horner et al. ( 1988 ) found that 
allergen extract of plural species was eff ective. Positive 
results of Pleurotus spp. feeding have also been reported 
in ulcerative colitis (Nosalva et al. 2001 ) and in 
atherosclerosis  (Bobek & Galbavy  1999 ). 
 
The demand supply of Pleurotus spp. mushroom  is 
increasing due to its nutritive and medic inal importance 
at global level as well as dome stic level . It has imme rsed 
as a p opular  item in soup s and for vegetable purpose  
even having high prices . With rise in the acceptance of 
Pleurotus spp. mushroom the production and 
productivity is increased mak ing the commodity as a 
vegetable , its demand is expected to pick up fast . It 
should be popularized as  a nutritious source in human 
food.  
 
CONCLUSION  
 
In the present scenario of post -COVID era  Pleurotus  spp. 
mushroom can be suggested as a health food , full of 
nutrition and exhibits various p harmacological 
properties. I n Indian food culture there is a need  to more 
populariz e it as the food in common food pattern. In 
modern societies it is only used in fine dine culture of www.wjpls.org          │        Vol 9, Issue 7, 202 3.         │          ISO 9001:2015 Certified Journal         │ 190 Dubey .

upper classes.  The reason of this pat tern may be its high 
prices that can be controlled only by increasing its 
artificial cultivation.  Its more production is required to 
reduce its cost and there is need to develop various 
culture strategies having low cost method.
