Trametes hirsuta and a puriﬁed laccase from this organism were able to degrade triarylmethane, indigoid,
azo, and anthraquinonic dyes. Initial decolorization velocities depended on the substituents on the phenolicrings of the dyes. Immobilization of the T. hirsuta laccase on alumina enhanced the thermal stabilities of the
enzyme and its tolerance against some enzyme inhibitors, such as halides, copper chelators, and dyeingadditives. The laccase lost 50% of its activity at 50 mM NaCl while the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
50)o f
the immobilized enzyme was 85 mM. Treatment of dyes with the immobilized laccase reduced their toxicities(based on the oxygen consumption rate of Pseudomonas putida ) by up to 80% (anthraquinonic dyes). Textile
efﬂuents decolorized with T. hirsuta or the laccase were used for dyeing. Metabolites and/or enzyme protein
strongly interacted with the dyeing process indicated by lower staining levels (K/S) values than obtained witha blank using water. However, when the efﬂuents were decolorized with immobilized laccase, they could be usedfor dyeing and acceptable color differences ( DE*) below 1.1 were measured for most dyes.
It is known that 90% of reactive textile dyes entering acti-
vated sludge sewage treatment plants will pass through un-changed and will be discharged to rivers (34). Not all dyescurrently used could be degraded and/or removed with physi-cal and chemical processes, and sometimes the degradationproducts are more toxic (40). The traditional textile ﬁnishingindustry consumes about 100 liters of water to process about 1kg of textile materials. New closed-loop technologies such asthe reuse of microbially or enzymatically treated dyeing efﬂu-ents could help to reduce this enormous water consumption.
Several combined anaerobic and aerobic microbial treat-
ments have been suggested to enhance the degradation oftextile dyes (5, 23, 32). However, under anaerobic conditions,azo-reductases usually cleave azo dyes into the correspondingamines, many of which are mutagenic and/or carcinogenic (10,11, 32). Furthermore, azo reductases have been shown to bevery speciﬁc enzymes, thus cleaving only azo bonds of selecteddyes (50, 51). By contrast, laccases act oxidatively and lessspeciﬁcally on aromatic rings, thus having potential to degradea wider range of compounds (43).
Laccases are involved in the biodegradation of lignins, which
constitute the main noncarbohydrate component in wood andare among the most abundant groups of biopolymers in thebiosphere. A great number of white-rot fungi have been re-ported to produce the lignin-degrading enzymes laccase, ligninperoxidases, and manganese peroxidases, or at least one ofthese enzymes (15, 16, 44).
Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2)
have very broad substrate speciﬁcity with respect to the elec-tron donor. They catalyze the removal of a hydrogen atomfrom the hydroxyl group of ortho - and para-substituted mono-
and polyphenolic substrates and from aromatic amines byone-electron abstraction to form free radicals capable ofundergoing further depolymerization, repolymerization, de-methylation, or quinone formation (43, 49). Oxidation of me-
thoxyhydroquinones during lignin degradation followed by au-tooxidation of the resulting methoxysemiquinones results inthe formation of superoxide anion radicals, which can undergofurther reactions (21). The rather broad substrate speciﬁcity oflaccases may be additionally expanded by addition of redoxmediators, such as ABTS [2,2 9-azino bis[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-
sulfonic acid], 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, or compounds secretedby lignolytic fungi (6, 16, 27, 35, 47).
Laccases can be used for the treatment of efﬂuents from
pulp mills or from other industries containing chlorolignins orphenolic compounds (4, 8). The enzymes render phenolic com-pounds less toxic via degradation or polymerization reactionsand/or cross-coupling of pollutant phenols with naturally oc-curring phenols (25, 28, 45). Several processes using laccases aswell as immobilized laccases have been developed for the treat-ment of phenolic efﬂuents and polycylic aromatic hydrocar-bons (3, 9, 12, 13).
In this study, we have assessed the potential of Trametes
hirsuta and a laccase from this organism to continuously de-
grade textile dyes. We examined for the ﬁrst time the reuse ofenzymatically decolorized dyeing liquors for dyeing and thetoxicity of the degradation products.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Production of enzymes. The medium for cultivation of T. hirsuta (BT 2566)
contained 4.5% (wt/vol) wheat bran ﬂakes, 1.5% yeast extract, 1% glucose,0.25% NH
4Cl, 0.05% thiamine dichloride, 0.2% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4z7H2O,
0.01% CaCl2, and 0.05% KCl. Tap water was used for preparation of the me-
dium, and the pH was adjusted to 5.0 by using NaOH or HCl. Incubation wascarried out at 30°C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) in cotton-plugged 250-mlErlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 100 ml of media. Flasks were inoculated with 1-cm
2
agar pieces from an actively growing fungus on PDA agar. Cultures were har-vested after 10 days, ﬁltered, and clariﬁed by centrifugation at 7,800 3gfor 20
min to remove the mycelia, and the clear supernatant was used for the enzymeactivity assay and for further puriﬁcation. The predominant laccase (molecularmass, 45 kDa; isoelectric point, 3.5) from T. hirsuta was concentrated using
acetone precipitation and ultraﬁltration (30 kDa), and it was puriﬁed as de-scribed previously (20).
Enzyme immobilization. Alumina pellets were silanized at 45°C for 24 h in a
2.5% (vol/vol) solution of g-aminopropyltriethoxy silane in acetone. The si-
lanized pellets were washed with distilled water and immersed in 2% (vol/vol) * Corresponding author. Mailing address: Graz University of Tech-

provided by Universidade do Minho: RepositoriUMaqueous glutaraldehyde fo r2ha t 20°C. Thereafter, the pellets were incubated
with 60 mg of the crude enzyme preparation (obtained after acetone precipita-tion and ultraﬁltration of the culture ﬁltrate) per liter fo r5ha t 20°C. The
immobilized enzyme pellets were washed with potassium phosphate buffer (100mM, pH 7.0) and kept refrigerated until further use. Immobilized protein wasdetermined by protein analysis according to the method of Bradford by usingbovine serum albumin for the calibration (7).
Enzyme assay. Laccase activity was determined using 2,6-dimethoxyphenol
(DMP) as a substrate as described before (14). The reaction mixture contained50 mM sodium malonate (pH 4.5) and 1 mM DMP. The formation of 2,2 9,6,69-
demethoxydiphenoquinone (orange/brownish) at 30°C was followed spectropho-tometrically at 468 nm, and laccase activity was calculated from the molarextinction coefﬁcient ( e) of 49.6 mM
21cm21(46). Inhibition of the laccase was
determined using the enzyme assay described above after 5 min of preincubationof the enzyme with the inhibitors.
Microbial treatment of textile dyes and dyeing efﬂuents. T. hirsuta was culti-
vated as described above, and the mycelium was collected by ﬁltration underaseptic conditions and washed twice with 300 ml of sterilized distilled water. Asample of 1.5 g (wet weight) of mycelium was incubated for 8 days with differentdyes (ﬁnal concentration, 0.25 mM) as described for cultivation except that onlyglucose was used as a carbon source. Sterile controls without inoculum were alsomaintained under the same conditions. Growth of the fungus was inhibited withantibiotics to determine whether decolorization was due to metabolic activity ofthe organism or due to other phenomena. A mixture of 100 mg of benylateliter
21, 1,000 mg of cycloheximide liter21, and 300 mg of streptomycin antibiotic
solution liter21was prepared. A volume of 10% (vol/vol) of this solution was
added to the incubation mixtures. After 10 days, all incubation mixtures wereﬁltered using 0.22- mm-pore-size ﬁlter paper, the decolorization efﬁciency was
determined spectrophotometrically at the absorption maximum of each dye, andconcentrations were calculated from calibration curves. Adsorption of dyes tothe mycelium was determined by solubilization of the dyes with water or organicsolvents. Adsorbed dye was washed off the mycelium twice with 10 ml of water.The amount of dye adsorbed was calculated from the absorptions of the super-natants. In case of the dye Basic red 9 base, the mycelium was washed with water,50% (vol/vol) methanol, ethanol, and acetone. The mycelium was then sus-pended i n 4 N NaOH and disintegrated by ultrasoniﬁcation. After centrifugation,
the absorption of the solubilized dye in the supernatant was measured (17).
Enzymatic treatment of textile dyes. Typically, 4-ml test tubes or 300-ml
Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 0.25 mM dye and 10 nkat of laccase ml
21in 50 mM
sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) were incubated on a rotary shaker at 30°C for10 h. Heat-inactivated enzymes were used as control, and decolorization wasfollowed spectrophotometrically.
An enzyme reactor was constructed using a cross-ﬂow membrane ultraﬁltra-
tion system from Filtron (30-kDa exclusion; Northborough, Mass.). The dyesolution (0.25 mM dye in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer [pH 5.0]) was pumped(dual-piston pump) into a column (15 by 300 mm, 50-ml active volume) at a ﬂowrate of 0.1 ml min
21, and mixing was performed with a peristaltic pump at a ﬂow
rate of 1 ml min21. Initially, the column was ﬁlled with 7 nkat of laccase ml21in
50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Alternatively, the dye solutions describedabove were continuously pumped (0.1 ml min
21, dual-piston pump) through a
column (15 by 300 mm) ﬁlled with 50 ml of immobilized laccase correspondingto about 70 nkat of laccase activity. Both column reactors and the ﬂow cell werekept at 30°C. Decolorization was monitored on a spectrophotometer equippedwith a ﬂow cell. The effects of commercial dyeing additives (Ciba), salts, andknown laccase inhibitors on the immobilized laccase were determined analo-gously using DMP as a substrate.
Dyeing experiments. Bleached cotton fabrics were dyed in liquors containing
enzymatically decolorized (exactly 80% decolorization) dyes by using an AhibaSpectradye dyeing apparatus (Datacolor International, Lucerne, Switzerland) ata liquor-to-good ratio of 20:1 (40 rpm; step 1, temperature was raised from 20 to60°C in 20 min; step 2, 60°C, 60 min). All chemicals used are listed in Table 1.Dyed fabrics were washed at the same liquor ratio with the nonionic detergent
Hostapal CV (1 g liter
21for 30 min at 90°C to remove the unﬁxed dye. Diode
array spectrums (TIDAS instrument; J&M, Aalen, Germany) of dyes both instandard dye baths and in dye baths containing enzymatically decolorized dyeswere recorded. Color differences of the dyed fabrics were determined using areﬂectance-measuring apparatus (Spectraﬂash 600; Datacolor) according to theCIELAB color difference concept at standard illuminant D
65(large area of
observation of the sample, specularity excluded, d/8, D65/10°) with a color tol-
erance interval of 1 CIELAB unit. Color deviation was also quantiﬁed by cal-culating the staining level K/Svalues from reﬂectance measurements on the dyed
fabrics.
Detoxiﬁcation experiments. Solutions of dyes were treated with the T. hirsuta
laccase as described above to yield exactly 90% decolorization. The aquatictoxicities of samples were evaluated based on their inhibitory effects on theoxygen consumption rate of Pseudomonas putida . The experiments were con-
ducted according to the German standard methods for the examination of water,wastewater, and sludge (bioassays, group L 27 DIN 38 412) using the OXI 3000from WTW (Weinheim, Germany) for automated measurements of the oxygenconsumption rate. Detoxiﬁcation was expressed as the decrease (expressed as apercentage) of the inhibitory effect on the oxygen consumption rate between acontrol and the treated sample.
Results are given as the average of two separate experiments.
RESULTS
Triarylmethane, indigoid, azo, and anthraquinonic dyes
were degraded by T. hirsuta and a puriﬁed laccase from this
organism (Fig. 1; Table 2). Except for Reactive Black 5 andBasic Red 9, a similar pattern was observed for microbial andenzymatic degradation, suggesting that the extracellular lac-case seems to be mainly responsible for degradation of thedyes. Anthraquinonic dyes and indigo carmine (Acid Blue 74)were degraded more than twofold faster than the azo dyes byboth T. hirsuta and the puriﬁed laccase. Adsorption of dyes to
the mycelium did not contribute to microbial decolorizationsince a maximum of 1.5% of the dye added was bound to themycelium except for Basic Red 9, for which 7% of the dye hadbound to the mycelium after incubation of 6 days. Whengrowth of T. hirsuta was inhibited by antibiotics, no decolor-
ization was measured after the same incubation period (datanot shown).
Continuous decolorization was achieved with a membrane
reactor. All enzyme was retained in the reactor; however, themembrane had to be cleaned or replaced periodically becauseof plugging with enzyme protein. Furthermore, an up-scalingof this system would be limited by the cost of membrane andthroughput. To overcome these limitations and to increaseenzyme stabilities, the laccase was immobilized on aluminasupport; 89% of the enzyme preparation bound to the carriercorresponding to 0.14 mg g alumina
21, and 68% of the laccase
activity was retained in the alumina pellets, which was mea-sured in a column reactor. Using this column reactor, thestabilities of the immobilized enzyme and the pure laccaseTABLE 1. Experimental conditions for dyeing with dyes from different classes

bilized laccase column seems to be determined by the stabilityof the enzyme under industrial conditions (pH, temperature,additives) rather than by physical phenomena, such as cloggingof the column.
The immobilized enzyme was slightly more stable at 60°C
and pH 4.5 (half-life, 13.0 h) than the free enzyme (half-life,11.5 h). Various known laccase inhibitors, salts and textiledyeing auxiliaries, which are usually applied in combinationwith textile dyes were tested for potential inhibitory effects onthe immobilized and free enzyme. Sodium azide was the stron-gest inhibitor, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
50)o f
0.002 mM for both the immobilized and free laccases. Theimmobilized laccase was less vulnerable (e.g., IC50of up to
3.5-fold higher than that for DCC) to all other laccase inhib-itors than the free enzyme. The effect of dyeing auxiliaries onthe laccase was determined at a ﬁxed concentration of 2 gliter
21, which is commonly applied in the industry. Sequester-
ing agents and anionic surfactants caused less than 20% inhi-bition, while wetting and soaping agents and cationic surfac-tants did not have any signiﬁcant inhibitory effect on the free
and immobilized laccases from T. hirsuta (Table 3).
Various textile dyes were decolorized with the immobilized
laccase, and the toxicity of the degradation products was de-termined (Table 4). The extent of decolorization was standard-ized to 80% for all dyes. Under these conditions, the anthra-quinonic dyes were detoxiﬁed to about 80%, while the toxicityof the azo dyes Reactive Black 5 and Direct Blue 71 decreasedonly by 13 and 40%, respectively. The copper containing dyeReactive Blue 221 was detoxiﬁed only to a very low extent bythe enzyme treatment (4.1%).
The fungus T. hirsuta , a laccase, and an immobilized laccase
from this organism were compared for their ability to decol-orize textile dye solutions to an extent which would allow reuseof the solutions in the dyeing process. T. hirsuta was incubated
with various textile dyes, and the decolorized solutions wereused for dyeing. Reactive Yellow 160 was chosen for dyeingwith the decolorized solutions to ensure detection of evensmall interferences in the dyeing process, which could other-wise not be seen when using dark colors. Obviously, the fungusproduced metabolites and/or degradation products whichstrongly interfered with the subsequent dyeing process, andonly K/S values between 55 and 69% of those of the blank

reached (Fig. 2).
Two recalcitrant textile dyes (Reactive Blue 19 and 221) that
are difﬁcult to remove from efﬂuents were chosen to assess thedecolorization potential of the T. hirsuta laccase for reuse of
the solution for dyeing. Degradation products or the enzymepresent in the decolorized solutions obviously interfered withdyeing, since the K/Svalues of fabrics dyed in a dyebath pre-
pared with these solutions were signiﬁcantly lower than thoseobtained using water (Fig. 2). An even more pronounced in-terference was measured when the same amount of protein(bovine serum albumin) instead of enzyme was present in thesolution used for dyeing. However, when the decolorizationwas carried out in a reactor retaining the enzyme, the resultingsolution yielded K/S values in dyeing which were only 1%
(decolorized Reactive Blue 19) and 10% (Reactive Blue 221)lower than that of the blank. Based on these promising results,further experiments were carried out with an immobilized lac-case.
In a second step, the effect of using dye solutions decolorized
with immobilized laccase for dyeing was studied in more detailin terms of acceptability of the resulting color difference. Theshift of the coordinates of the color in the cylindrical colorspaces L*, a*, and b*, based on the theory that color is per-
ceived by black-white (L), red-green (a), and yellow-blue (b)sensations (22), was summarized by the DE* value. The value
ofDE* represents the overall color difference between the
sample and the standard (Fig. 3). The DE* values for more
than half of the combinations of decolorized dyes and dyeingprocesses were in the acceptable range of about 1.1. Dyeing inbright colors with decolorized dye solutions yielded worse re-sults than dyeing in dark colors. Diode Array spectra of Re-active Green 19, Reactive Black 5, and Everzol Brilliant Red3BS in solutions of enzymatically decolorized dyes did notshow any shift but an increase in the absorption maximum, andthus, no change of the color in the dyeing solution was detected(data not shown). For Direct Blue 199 and Direct Yellow 86,a decrease and shift of the absorption maximum was observed.Correlation between absorbency measurement in solution and
reﬂectance measurements on dyed fabrics was evident (18).TABLE 3. Inhibition of laccase and immobilized laccase from T.

Decolorization of dyes by T. hirsuta was mainly ascribed to
extracellular laccase activity, which is in agreement with resultsreported previously for T. hispida (36). 1-Amino-subtituted
antraquinoid dyes were good substrates for the T. hirsuta lac-
case, and they were degraded to a similar extent. Out of thetwo azo dyes, Direct Blue 71 was the preferred substrate fortheT. hirsuta laccase, which might be due to limited accessi-
bility of the 2OH and 2NH
2groups in Reactive Black 5.
However, for smaller substrates, the electronic contribution ofsubstituents on the aromatic ring seemed to be more importantthan steric effects (48). Electron-donating methyl and methoxysubstituents seemed to enhance laccase activity, while electron-withdrawing chloro, ﬂuoro, and nitro substituents inhibitedoxidation of azophenols and other substituted phenols andphenol analogs by fungal laccases (10, 48).
The T. hirsuta laccase retained 50% of its activity at 50 mM
NaCl, while the immobilized enzyme tolerated a higher NaClconcentration (IC
50585 mM NaCl). Other authors have re-
ported a wide IC50range, between 0.4 and 600 mM for Cl2, for
fungal laccases (48). It has been suggested that the magnitudeof inhibition of laccases by halides depends on the accessibilityof the copper atoms and can thus vary between different lac-cases and inhibitors. In plant laccases, the channels to theT2/T3 sites seem to be wider than those in fungal laccases,which are inhibited to a lower extent. Among various halides,F
2was the strongest inhibitor for the T. hirsuta laccase, fol-
lowed by Cl2and Br2. The same trend has been previously
observed for a number of fungal laccases (48).
Additives used during textile processing can signiﬁcantly af-
fect enzyme activities (29). Anionic surfactants, which inhib-ited the T. hirsuta laccase by about 20%, seem to interact with
the positively charged side chain of an amino acid after pene-tration of the 3-dimensional protein structure by the hydro-phobic tail. In contrast, cationic surfactants did not show anysigniﬁcant denaturation effect. The T. hirsuta laccase was in-
hibited by 17% when incubated with a sequestering agentwhich is used for the inactivation of copper and iron duringtextile processing. Many laccases are inhibited by metal chela-tors, such as EDTA, and more speciﬁcally by copper chelators,such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) (4, 19). Type one cop-per is exposed to solvents and can be easily removed by com-plexons (49). EDTA at a concentration of up to 200 mMshowed no effect on the T. hirsuta laccase. However, DDC
(IC
5051.2 mM) strongly inhibited the enzyme like many other
fungal laccases, such as those from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus
(17), from Botrytis cinerea (39), from Pleurotus ostreatus , and
from Trametes versicolor (4), for which the IC50s were below 1
mM.
Interestingly, the immobilized T. hirsuta laccase was less
sensitive to some inhibitors, such as F2and DCC, than the free
enzyme. Similar ﬁndings have been reported for an immobi-lized laccase from Phlebia radiata , which was much less vulner-
able to inhibitors than the free enzyme (38). The introductionof covalent bonds during immobilization usually enhances sta-bilities of enzymes due to the limitation of conformationalchanges.
Immobilization of fungal laccases on various carrier materi-
als, such as activated carbon (13), agarose (35), Eupergit C(12), Sepharose (30), and porosity glass (37, 38), has beenshown to increase stabilities of the enzyme at high pH andtolerance to elevated temperatures and to make the enzymeless vulnerable to inhibitors, such as Cu chelators. The effec-tivities of all these immobilization techniques varied between70 to 98% of the protein immobilized and 67 to 96% of laccaseactivity recovery (13, 33, 38). Similarly, in our experiments,
89% of the protein was immobilized on alumina and 68% ofthe laccase activity was recovered.
Previously, it was found that a considerable number of tex-
tile wastewaters reacted toxically and mutagenically (26, 31).Toxicity assays using bacteria or daphnia have been found tobe more sensitive than testing methods with ﬁsh (26). Variousexamples for application of the luminescent bacteria test intextiles have been discussed (42). Alternatively, the oxygenconsumption rate of P. putida has been used as a parameter to
monitor detoxiﬁcation (24). Using a respiration-inhibition test,it has been found that anarobic degradation of azo dyes ren-dered the efﬂuents more toxic by generating amines, while asecond aerobic treatment eliminated this toxicity (32). Al-though microbial treatment of textile efﬂuents has been foundto reduce ecotoxicity (2, 32), there is no information availableon detoxiﬁcation of textile efﬂuents with enzymes. Only re-cently have laccases been used to reduce the toxicity of woodhydrolysates for yeast fermentation (28). Using the P. putida
test, we found that the toxicity of several dyes, including azocompounds, was reduced by the laccase treatment. A reactionmechanism has been recently suggested for the degradation ofazo dyes by laccases involving the conversion of azo-nitrogeninto molecular nitrogen (10). In our experiments, there was nostrict correlation between decolorization and detoxiﬁcation,indicating that dye degradation products were still toxic insome cases. Reactive Blue 221, a copper-containing dye, re-tained most of its toxicity after the enzyme treatment.
Reusing the laccase-treated efﬂuent in the dyeing process,
we found that enzyme protein obviously strongly interferedwith the dyeing process while promising results were obtainedwith the immobilized enzyme. This was indicated by DE* val-
ues of the dyed fabrics below 1.1, which is acceptable to theindustry (1, 22, 41). Shifts in the dye absorption maximum ofthe solution could be caused by binding of auxochromes to thedye molecules. Alternatively, degradation products and/or pro-tein could cause aggregation of dye molecules, preventing thedye uptake to the fabric, which would cause larger color fail-ure. In both cases, adjustments of the standard dyeing proto-cols would certainly improve redyeing and allow partial recy-cling of dyeing additives.
In this paper, we have shown that both water consumption
and efﬂuent toxicity in textile dyeing could be reduced by“enzyme remediation” with laccases. Further studies focusingon the nature of degradation products and their role in thedyeing process should be carried out.
