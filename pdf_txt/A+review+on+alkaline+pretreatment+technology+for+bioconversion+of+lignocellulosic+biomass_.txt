The native form of lignocellulosic biomass is resistant to enzymatic breakdown. A well-designed pretreat-
ment that can promote enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass with reasonable processing cost is therefore nec-essary. To this end, a number of different types of pretreatment technologies have been developed with a
common goal of making biomass more susceptible to enzymatic sacchariﬁcation. Among those, a pre-
treatment method using alkaline reagent has emerged as one of the most viable process options due pri-marily to its strong pretreatment effect and relatively simple process scheme. The main features of
alkaline pretreatment are that it selectively removes lignin without degrading carbohydrates, and
increases porosity and surface area, thereby enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis. In this review, the leadingalkaline pretreatment technologies are described and their features and comparative performances arediscussed from a process viewpoint. Attempts were also made to give insights into the chemical and
physical changes of biomass brought about by pretreatment.

1. Introduction
Lignocellulosic biomass is composed of carbohydrates (cellulose
and hemicellulose), lignin, and other extraneous components (pro-
teins, lipids, and inorganic substances) ( Kim, 2013 ). It is a renew-
able and abundant resource suitable for production of bio-based
products such as biofuels and chemicals. Bio-based products pro-
duced from renewable sources are desirable alternatives to con-
ventional petroleum-based fuels and chemicals; such bio-based
products are also the backbone of the bioreﬁnery concept. Accord-
ing to the International Energy Agency (IEA) report ( IEA Bioenergy,
2009 ), bioreﬁnery is deﬁned as the process for sustainable process-
ing of lignocellulosic biomass into various bio-based products(food, feed, chemicals, and materials) and bioenergy (biofuels,
power and/or heat). The bioreﬁnery concept calls for lignocellu-
losic biomass to be processed with one of two end goals: (1) to
be fractionated into three main components for further conversion
to bio-based products with maximal added-value, or (2) to produce
primarily biofuels, with residues as co-products. The US Depart-
ment of Energy (DOE) ( Werpy and Petersen, 2004 ) reported that
as many as twelve important building block chemicals can be pro-
duced from sugars through either biological or chemical conver-
sions ( Holladay et al., 2007 ). It is anticipated that bioreﬁning
technology will play a leading role in creating a new bio-based
industrial sector to replace fuels and chemicals currently produced
from fossil oil, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ( Mabee and
Saddler, 2010; Park and Kim, 2012 ).
Commercialization of cellulosic ethanol production, the ﬁrst step
toward bioreﬁnery, still remains challenging because of technical

Conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose biologically using
enzymes and microbes requires ﬁve main unit processes: (1)
mechanical size reduction (chopping/grinding), (2) pretreatment
to make the cellulosic parts more amenable to enzymatic reaction,
(3) enzymatic sacchariﬁcation to hydrolyze cellulose/hemicellulose
into monomeric sugars (fermentable sugars), (4) microbial fermen-
tation to convert monomeric sugars into fuels and chemicals, and
(5) product recovery and puriﬁcation. In an integrated biomass con-
version process, pretreatment becomes a key element because the
design of the subsequent sacchariﬁcation and fermentation pro-
cesses rely strongly upon the result of pretreatment. The ultimate
goal of pretreatment is to improve the enzymatic hydrolysis of car-
bohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose) consequently increasing
overall bioconversion efﬁciency for production of sugars.
In order to achieve this goal, various pretreatment methods,
most involving chemical pretreatment, have been proposed, and
various reagents and catalysts for different substrates developed.
The known methods are: steam/steam explosion ( Liu and Chen,
2015 ), grinding/milling, hot water/autohydrolysis ( Timung et al.,
2015; Garrote et al., 2002; Vaquez et al., 2001 ), acid treatment
(Jacobsen and Wyman, 2000; Kim et al., 2001 ), alkali treatment
(Ferrer et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2003; Yoo et al.,
2011 ), and other methods. The outcome of each pretreatment var-
ies widely in terms of its physical and chemical characteristics
(Kim, 2013 ).
Among aforementioned pretreatment options, alkaline pretreat-
ment has emerged as one of the front runners because it has a num-
ber of desirable features. Alkaline methods utilize mostly non-
polluting and non-corrosive chemicals such as ammonia (aqueous,
liquid, and gaseous), sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and cal-
cium hydroxide (lime). Alkaline pretreatment is carried out under
milder conditions than those needed for acid pretreatment. Alka-
line reagents interact primarily with lignin; therefore, they are
more efﬁcient for lignin removal. In this paper, various alkaline pre-
treatment technologies are reviewed. These include: ammonia
recycle percolation (ARP), ammonia ﬁber explosion/expansion
(AFEX), soaking in aqueous ammonia (SAA), low-liquid ammonia
(LLA), low-moisture anhydrous ammonia (LMAA), and other alka-
line technologies using NaOH, and Ca(OH) 2. Reaction mechanisms,
major effects, background, processing schemes, and the advantages
and disadvantages related to alkaline pretreatment technologies
are discussed. Overall, the paper reviews the role of pretreatment
technologies using alkaline reagents in bioreﬁnery, which can pro-
duce high value products from lignocellulosic biomass.
2. Lignocellulosic biomass
Lignocellulosic biomass is categorized into four major groups
based on its source: (1) woody biomass, (2) agricultural residues
(rice/wheat/barley straws, corn stover, sugarcane bagasse), (3)
energy crops (switchgrass, miscanthus, short rotation hardwood
speciﬁcally grown for biofuel production), and (4) various types
of cellulosic wastes (municipal solid waste, pulp mill and lumber
mill wastes). Regarding plant taxonomy, these sources are simply
classiﬁed as hardwood or softwood tree species, or grass species.
However, some agricultural residues and some energy crops such
as switchgrass, miscanthus, and elephant grass ( Pennisetum pur-
pureum ), are considered herbaceous plants. The softwoods (gym-
nosperms) are a group of seed-producing, non-ﬂowering plants,
mostly conifers and cycads. The deciduous ﬂowering plants that
have broad leaves are called hardwood.
Lignocellulosic biomass is heterogeneous polymeric material
comprised of carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose), lignin,
and other components. Many factors affect biological conversion
of lignocellulosic biomass, and these include chemical and physicalbarriers that inhibit its enzyme hydrolysis ( Kim et al., 2003; Kim,
2013 ). Carbohydrates, particularly plant cellulose, has a highly
crystalline, recalcitrant structure, which makes the enzymatic
hydrolysis of cellulose extremely difﬁcult ( Kim, 2013 ). The pres-
ence of lignin has also been proven to a major factor hindering
enzymatic reaction and microbial fermentation ( Brown, 2003;
Wyman, 1996; Yang and Wyman, 2006; Kim and Lee, 2006 ). Lignin
is a hydrophobic hetero-polymer of three monomers (coniferyl
alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and p-coumaryl alcohol), which is resis-
tant to microbial attack. Lowering the lignin content is desirable
during pretreatment because this enhances enzyme sacchariﬁca-
tion and microbial fermentation.
3. Desirable pretreatment process and process options
The purpose of pretreatment is to make lignocellulosic biomass
amenable to enzymatic reactions (sacchariﬁcation) with reason-
able processing cost. Some commonly observed outcomes of pre-
treatment include decrease of lignin content, increase of surface
area, and decrease of crystallinity of the biomass; all of which
result in enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis rate and yield ( Kim
et al., 2003; Kim, 2013 ). Pretreatment is an essential element in
the bioreﬁning of lignocellulosic substrates. Kim (2013) described
that pretreatment plays a major role in the economics of the over-
all bioconversion process because all of the subsequent processes
(enzymatic sacchariﬁcation, fermentation, and the downstream
processes) are tailored to the pretreatment results. Ideally, a pre-
treatment process should (1) improve the enzymatic hydrolysis
reaction, (2) produce minimal/no inhibitory compounds, and (3)
require reasonable capital and operating costs (with low energy
input and minimal waste) ( Drapcho et al., 2008; Kim, 2013 ).
Pretreatment can effectively overcome both chemical and phys-
ical barriers and enhance the enzymatic digestibility of biomass if
proper chemical reagents/catalysts are applied. For selection of
optimal treatment reagent/catalyst, a strategy must be set for the
removal of lignin and/or hemicellulose. Pretreatment at high tem-
perature with short reaction time (e.g., by dilute sulfuric acid, ARP,
or steam explosion), could improve the enzymatic digestibility of
the treated solid signiﬁcantly by removing some of the carbohy-
drates, mostly hemicellulose. Unfortunately, such a process also
degrades sugars into inhibitory compounds. High temperature pro-
cesses induce high pressure, thus requiring high-pressure materi-
als and vessels and high energy inputs. These lead to high capital
and operating costs of the biomass processing facility. Pretreat-
ments designed to operate at low or moderate temperature (e.g.,
SAA, AFEX, LMAA, LLA, lime treatment) require longer reaction
time to compensate for the less severe conditions. During pretreat-
ment, partial degradation of carbohydrates (hexose and pentose),lignin, and other components takes place, producing furfural, 5-
HMF, phenols, and various acids. If the reaction conditions (tem-
perature, time, and reagent concentration) are severe enough to
remove lignin and hemicellulose, breakdown of the sugars and
other soluble components also occurs. Therefore, the selection of
proper treatment conditions is necessary, and is the key to effec-
tive conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into sugars with minimal
formation of inhibitory compounds. For selection of a pretreatment
method, not only effective enzymatic hydrolysis, but also undesir-
able side reactions, especially degradation of carbohydrate and lig-
nin to inhibitory components, must be taken into consideration.
4. Alkaline pretreatment4.1. Description of alkaline pretreatment technologies
Alkaline pretreatment technologies applying various reagents
have been investigated for the common purpose of improving2 J.S. Kim et al. / Bioresource Technology xxx (2015) xxx–xxx

Technol. (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.085enzyme digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass. The ones in this
category are: (1) sodium hydroxide ( Modenbach, 2013 ), (2) ammo-
nia ( Kim et al., 2003; Kim and Lee, 2005, 2007; Yoo et al., 2011; Li
and Kim, 2011 ), and (3) calcium hydroxide ( Karr and Holtzapple,
2000; Kim and Holtzapple, 2005, 2006 ).Table 1 presents an over-
view of representative alkaline pretreatment technologies. Alkaline
pretreatment reagents are less caustic than acidic reagents such as
sulfuric acid and sulﬁte. Alkaline pretreatments are carried out
under milder conditions, some of them even at ambient tempera-
ture, as evidenced by soaking in sodium hydroxide, or in ammo-
nium hydroxide. Such methods can eliminate the need for
expensive materials and special designs to cope with corrosion
and severe reaction conditions. It is also possible to recover and
reuse chemical reagents in some of the alkaline pretreatment
methods ( Table 2 ).
The major reactions during alkaline pretreatment include disso-
lution of lignin and hemicellulose, and de-esteriﬁcation (saponiﬁ-
cation) of intermolecular ester bonds ( Kim, 2013 ). These also
alter the DP (degree of polymerization) of each component, and
bring about changes in the physical properties of treated solids.
Such changes might involve surface area, porosity, and crys-
tallinity. The change in the gross crystallinity index is primarily
due to removal of amorphous regions (lignin and hemicellulose)
of the biomass, rather than to structural change in the cellulose
ﬁbers. This is the reason that the gross crystallinity index of treated
biomass often rises after pretreatment. Kim and Holtzapple (2006)
reported that the activation energy (50.2–54.2 kJ/mol) used for
deligniﬁcation of grass (herbaceous) species (bagasse, corn stover,
etc.) by alkaline pretreatment (lime) was much lower than that
required for deligniﬁcation of wood by the Kraft process. It appearsthat alkaline pretreatment is much more effective for deligniﬁca-
tion of grass species than of woody species.
4.2. Pretreatment technologies
4.2.1. Sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate pretreatments
In the Kraft pulping process, a mixture of sodium hydroxide and
sodium sulﬁde, known as white liquor, is used as the pulping
reagent. This white liquor then turns into ‘‘green liquor”, pulping
terminology for a solution of sodium carbonate and sodium sulﬁde
(Na 2S). To regenerate the spent white liquor and to recover sodium
hydroxide, the green liquor is mixed with calcium hydroxide (Ca
(OH) 2). Recently, the use of green liquor for pretreatment of ligno-
cellulosic biomass has drawn considerable attention due to its high
selectivity for deligniﬁcation and high retention of carbohydrates
(Wu et al., 2011 ). Pretreatment using sodium hydroxide alone is
a technically feasible pretreatment method.
Sodium hydroxide pretreatment, in fact, has a long history
(since the 1900s) of study aimed at increasing the digestibility of
cellulose by rumen animals. This strong base solubilizes hemicellu-
lose and lignin signiﬁcantly under certain conditions ( Sjostrom,
1993 ). Sodium hydroxide is one of the strongest base catalysts,
so the effectiveness of pretreatment using it is evidenced by a
greater degree of enzyme hydrolysis than with other alkaline
pretreatments.
Sodium hydroxide effectively attacks the linkage between lig-
nin and hemicellulose in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCC); in
particular, it cleaves the ether and ester bonds in the LCC structure.
Sodium hydroxide is also effective for cleavage of the ester and
carbon-to-carbon (C–C) bonds in lignin molecules (ferulic acid).Table 1

sociated into hydroxide ion (OH/C0) and sodium ion (Na+) and, as the
hydroxide ion concentration increases, the rate of the hydrolysis
reaction increases accordingly ( Modenbach, 2013 ).
4.2.2. Ammonia pretreatment
Among alkaline pretreatments, ammonia-based treatments
have been investigated most extensively for a number of reasons.
It is easily recoverable, non-corrosive, and non-toxic. It is inexpen-
sive to the extent that the majority ( /C2480%) of ammonia produced is
currently used for production of fertilizer. Ammonia is a commod-
ity chemical widely used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food
industries. It is used in many household items such as cleansing
and antiseptic solutions ( Jensen, 2009 ). Its industrial use and
recovery procedures are well-established. Ammonia can be easilyrecovered and reused because of its high volatility, and it offers
versatile processing options ( Kim, 2013; Kim and Lee, 2006 ).
The main effects of ammonia pretreatment methods include
removal or modiﬁcation of lignin, increase of surface area and/or
pore size, and modiﬁcation of cellulose and hemicellulose struc-
tures. In aqueous form, it causes swelling of the biomass, which
brings signiﬁcant morphological change. It also affects the degree
of crystallinity of the integral biomass, if not the core of cellulose
ﬁbers, as compared to other alkaline pretreatment methods.
Ammonia pretreatment opens up the structure of the biomass,
making it amenable to enzymatic hydrolysis ( Kim et al., 2009 ).
4.2.2.1. Aqueous ammonia pretreatment. As the ﬁrst-of-its-kind
ammonia-based process, ammonia recycle percolation (ARP) was
investigated for pretreatment of herbaceous and hardwood bio-
mass ( Kim and Lee, 1996; Kim et al., 2003 ). It employs a ﬁxed-
bed reactor operated in ﬂow-through mode (also called a percola-
tion reactor). A unique feature of this reactor is that it can mini-
mize re-polymerization and re-precipitation of soluble lignin
onto the biomass surface because the soluble lignin is discharged
from the reactor as soon as it is formed. It was built and tested
as a proof-of-concept laboratory reactor. Although a continuous
reactor is desirable in a commercial scale operation, the continuous
version of it (co-current auger-driven reactor where the ﬂow of liq-
uid is faster than the solid ﬂow) is yet to be developed. The main
advantage of the ARP is its efﬁcient lignin removal. More than
80% lignin removal is not uncommon in ARPs, and satisfactory
improvement of digestibility has been observed in a number of
studies using herbaceous biomass and hardwood feedstock ( Kim
and Holtzapple, 2005; Kim and Lee, 1996, 2005; Kim et al., 2003,
2006 ). The reaction conditions in ARPs are typically 10–15%
ammonia, 150–210 /C176C, and /C242.3 MPa. From a process viewpoint,
ARP has its shortcomings. It is a high temperature process thatrequires high energy input and high liquid throughput. The recov-
ery of ammonia is also an energy intensive process. In addition,
approximately 50% of the hemicellulose is lost along with the sol-
uble lignin during operation of the ARP. Although hemicellulose
sugars are not decomposed during ARP, they are considered lost
because they are recovered at low concentrations in oligomer form,
already contaminated with lignin degradation products and extra-
neous components, which makes them unusable for bioconversion.
To alleviate the problem of hemicellulose loss during ARP, a
simple batch process was developed using aqueous ammonia (i.
e., soaking in aqueous ammonia or SAA). In SAA tests performed
on corn stover, the biomass was soaked in 15–30% ammonia at
low temperature (30–80 /C176C) for extended periods (4–24 h), which
resulted in retention of more than 80% of the hemicellulose and
near 100% of the cellulose ( Kim et al., 2009 ). However, it appears
that SAA is effective only for herbaceous biomass. It should also
be noted that commercial ‘‘cellulase” invariably contains enough
xylanase activity to concurrently hydrolyze both xylan and glucanin alkaline-treated solids. This is evidenced by successful conver-
sion of corn stover to ethanol by simultaneous sacchariﬁcation
and cofermentation (SSCF) ( Kim and Lee, 2005 ). The advantage of
retaining hemicellulose as a solid is that this makes it possible to
avoid the formidable task of biologically converting the contami-
nated lean sugar oligomers into desired product, a costly, multi-
stage process. The SAA pretreatment is effective in removing lignin
(60–70% removal). Other issues with SAA are its long reaction time
and high liquid throughput.
In order to reduce the chemical input and water use, the low
liquid ammonia (LLA) pretreatment based on aqueous ammonia
was developed ( Li and Kim, 2011 ). The LLA process requires less
liquid and ammonia loading than those of SAA and ARP. In LLA,
minimal ammonia and liquid (1:0.2–5.0 w/w of solid-to-liquidratio) are applied for an extended period (4–12 weeks). Thisenhances the enzymatic hydrolysis yield signiﬁcantly. It is also
conducted under mild conditions ( /C2430/C176C,/C24ambient pressure),
and yielded ethanol at 73% of the theoretical maximum based on
the amount of total carbohydrates (glucan + xylan) present in the
untreated material.
Because LLA uses aqueous ammonia, it is anticipated that LLA
could more easily be applied to the industry than could pretreat-
ments using gaseous ammonia because ammonia gas is more difﬁ-
cult to handle than ammonia liquid, without increasing pressure.
4.2.2.2. Anhydrous ammonia pretreatment. The LMAA process uses
anhydrous ammonia to overcome problems inherent with conven-
tional pretreatment processes using aqueous ammonia. Previous
methods such as ARP and SAA require high chemical loading and
excessive water use for both pretreatment reaction and washing
steps because they are liquid-phase reactions ( Yoo et al., 2011 ).
Use of LMAA can signiﬁcantly reduce the water and energy input
compared to those involving aqueous ammonia pretreatment.
The LMAA process includes three steps: ammoniation under
ambient conditions in the ﬁrst step, pretreatment (40–150 /C176C for
72–96 h) in the second step, and evaporation/recovery of excess
ammonia in the third step. The biggest advantage of LMAA is that
it does not require a washing step to remove and recover residual
ammonia because it contains little water (moisture) and ammonia
loadings. The residual ammonia in the biomass can provide anti-
microbial effects during long- and mid-term storage in the biore-
ﬁnery facilities. The adsorbed ammonia can also serve as a nitrogen
source for the microorganisms used in the subsequent fermenta-
tion process ( Yoo et al., 2011, 2014 ). It was reported that 89% of
the theoretical ethanol yield (based on glucan + xylan in corn
stover) was attained during simultaneous sacchariﬁcation and
co-fermentation (SSCF) of LMAA-treated corn stover ( Yoo et al.,
2011 ). The optimal conditions reported for LMAA were: 0.1 g-
NH
3/g-solid, 1.0 solid/liquid ratio, 80 /C176C, and 84 h of pretreatment
time.
The AFEX (ammonia ﬁber explosion/expansion) process was
introduced as a pretreatment method for lignocellulosic biomass
(Dale et al., 1985 ). Its effect is similar to that of LMMA except that
it utilizes anhydrous liquid ammonia. Because it was introduced in
the early 1980s, several different and improved versions of AFEX
have been developed. In the AFEX process, biomass is contacted
with liqueﬁed anhydrous ammonia at elevated temperature (60–
120/C176C). After treatment, the pressure is rapid released. Due to
expansion of the liquid ammonia trapped in the biomass, its struc-
ture is disrupted, which is a beneﬁcial pretreatment effect. The
ammonia used in the pretreatment is recovered at this stage in
the form of a low-pressure gas, and reused. The pretreatment con-
ditions of AFEX are moderate for temperature and high for pres-
sure. Because most of it is recovered, net consumption of
ammonia is low. During AFEX, neither component dissolution nor
weight loss of solids occurs. According to a recent report, AFEX4 J.S. Kim et al. / Bioresource Technology xxx (2015) xxx–xxx

Technol. (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.085de-crystallizes the cellulose, hydrolyses hemicellulose, depolymer-
izes lignin, and increases the micropores in the cell wall structure
(Mosier et al., 2005 ). Therefore, the structure of the biomass is
changed, resulting in increased water holding capacity and higher
digestibility ( Stuart and El-Halwagi, 2012 ).
AFEX treatment also alters the structure of the cellulose and lig-
nin, which results in modiﬁcation and redistribution of lignins
(Martinez et al., 1991 ). Like other ammonia pretreatments, the
residual ammonia left in the pretreated biomass can be used as a
nutrient for microorganisms, thus facilitating fermentation ( Dale
et al., 1985 ). AFEX does not degrade biomass carbohydrates
signiﬁcantly.
The AFEX process does have drawbacks. The use of high pres-
sure treatment raises the cost of equipment. The energy require-
ment is high for ammonia recovery, which involvesrecompression of anhydrous ammonia gas to liquid. Because pres-
sure swings occur in the reactor operation and ammonia recovery,
scale up of the process may encounter technical difﬁculties
(Drapcho et al., 2008 ).
4.2.2.3. Ammonolysis. Ammonolysis is a chemical reaction analo-
gous to hydrolysis, only in this case an ammonia ion (NH
2-) plays
the role of water molecules in hydrolysis. The ammonia molecule
is dissociated producing H+and NH 2/C0species, which then induces
breakage of chemical bonds in LCCs and lignins. The presence of
LCCs (lignin-carbohydrate complex) in lignocellulosic biomass
has been conﬁrmed, and various chemical linkages have been iden-
tiﬁed between lignin and the carbohydrates present in LCC struc-
tures ( Du et al., 2013 ). The major linkages in biomass include
ether (R-O-R’) and ester (R-CO-OR’) bonds in LCCs, and ether (C–
O–C) bonds in lignin polymers. Ammonia molecules promote very
effective selective cleavage of these linkages, leading to lignin dis-solution and eventually to lignin removal ( Kim, 2013 ).
4.2.3. Lime pretreatment
Pretreatment using lime (Ca(OH)
2) has also been developed
(Karr and Holtzapple, 2000; Kim and Holtzapple, 2005 ). Although
the lime pretreatment was introduced as one that could operate
under mild reaction conditions, it can be operated in a variety of
modes and conditions: (1) high temperature for short reaction
time (100–160 /C176C, <6 h, /C24200 psig) with or without oxygen; (2)
low temperature for long-term pretreatment (55–65 /C176C, 2–
8 weeks, atmospheric pressure) with or without air; or as (3) sim-
ple pretreatment requiring 1 h in boiling water, without air or oxy-
gen ( Sierra et al., 2009 ). Normal lime loading is in the range of
0.05–0.15 g-Ca(OH) 2/g-biomass (at concentration of 5–20% solids).
The key points of lime pretreatment are that it is simple and effec-
tive, especially for herbaceous (grass) biomass ( Chang and
Holtzapple, 2000; Karr and Holtzapple, 2000 ). The role of lime in
the process is that it removes most of the acetyl groups and about
30% of the lignin from the biomass, low lignin concentration being
the main factor promoting enhanced enzymatic sacchariﬁcation.
Although the pretreatment effect with lime is not as strong as that
with ammonia or sodium hydroxide, it is a simple and low-cost
process, which makes it an attractive pretreatment option
(Kim, 2013 ).
5. Internal barriers to enzymatic hydrolysis
5.1. Lignins
The effectiveness of alkaline pretreatment relies primarily on
lowering the lignin content in lignocellulosic biomass, which in
turn increases the rate and yield of enzymatic hydrolysis of
carbohydrates. In addition, alkaline reagents are more effectivefor deligniﬁcation of herbaceous biomass than woody biomass.
This is because woody material contains more lignin and is quite
different from herbaceous biomass in that weight of molecules is
greater and the molecules more tightly structured.
Lignin is an amorphous and highly complex polymer of three
aromatic alcohol units ( p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and
sinapyl alcohol) ( Freudenberg and Nash, 1968 ). Lignols are incor-
porated into the lignin polymeric structure in the form of phenyl-
propanoid units ( p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl lignins).
The various groups of biomass-source species have different
types of lignins, which contain different amounts of methoxy
groups within them ( Xu et al., 2014 ). Softwoods contain mostly
guaiacyl (a polymer of coniferyl alcohol) with small quantities of
p-hydroxyphenyl. On the other hand, hardwoods contain more syr-
ingyl units than softwood lignin, either a mixture of guaiacyl andsyringyl (a copolymer of coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol; found in
most dicots) or a mixture of all three types of lignins (in most
monocots) ( Boerjan et al., 2003 ). Dominant lignins in grasses and
palms are p-hydroxyphenyl (in addition to syringyl + guaiacyl)
and syringyl, respectively ( Kuroda et al., 2001 ). In terms of lignin
size and structure, hardwood has lignin of lower DP and more
methoxyl groups than softwood. Softwood lignins are much more
difﬁcult to delignify ( Brown, 2003; Sjostrom, 1993 ). For this reason,
only a few pretreatment methods have been developed for soft-
wood: sulﬁte pretreatment (SPORL) and ethanol organo-solv pre-
treatment ( Zhu et al., 2009; Pan et al., 2008 ).
According to the experimental work of Shimizu et al. (2012)
performed on various model lignin dimers; sodium hydroxide
under certain conditions (1 N NaOH, 40–70 /C176C for 3–7 h) cleaves
the dimer containing syringyl units more rapidly than guaiacyl-
guaiacyl dimers. In other words, the lignocellulosic biomass with
higher content of syringyl units tends to be more easily deligniﬁed
at higher pH; thus, hardwoods (syringyl + guaiacyl) is more suit-
able biomass for alkaline pretreatment than softwoods are. It
was also reported that grass species tend to have a ‘syringyl: gua-
iacyl’ ratio similar to that of hardwood ( Modenbach, 2013 ).
5.2. Inhibition mechanism of lignin
Cellulase enzymes (glucanase + xylanase) are known to be
inhibited by various degradation products, such as organic acids,
phenolic compounds, furfural, and hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF)
(Hodge et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2011 ). The fact that lignin and phe-
nolic compounds inhibit enzymatic reaction indicates that enzy-
matic sacchariﬁcation can be improved by lowering the lignin
content in the biomass prior to enzymatic hydrolysis. Although
the alkaline pretreatment is effective for deligniﬁcation, a high per-
centage of lignin removal is not necessary to effectively convert lig-nocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. Among alkaline
methods, AFEX and LMAA leave the lignin content intact (zero
deligniﬁcation), while SAA removes 50–60% of the lignin, which
is signiﬁcantly less lignin removal than that of ARP ( Alizadeh
et al., 2005; Yoo et al., 2011; Kim and Lee, 2006 ). It is not just
the gross amount of lignin in biomass that controls enzymatic
hydrolysis. The location of lignin in biomass, the lignin surface
area, and the properties and surface conditions of the lignin also
play signiﬁcant roles. One example is non-productive binding ofthe enzyme on lignin that makes the enzyme irreversibly inactive.
Such binding is related to the lignin surface area (not the gross
amount) and the location of the lignin, as well as to the properties
of the lignin surface that affects its afﬁnity with protein. In this
regard, blocking active lignin sites has emerged as a supplemen-
tary tool for pretreatment because this can improve enzyme efﬁ-
ciency. It has been proven that non-productive adsorption of
enzyme on lignin can be prevented using surfactants and proteins,
and these have signiﬁcantly improved the yield from enzymaticJ.S. Kim et al. / Bioresource Technology xxx (2015) xxx–xxx 5

The mechanism of lignin inhibition of the enzymatic hydrolysis
reaction has been veriﬁed.
6. Role of alkaline treatment in biomass reﬁning
Alkaline pretreatment can play an important role in the biore-
ﬁnery of lignocellulosic biomass because alkaline treatments can
be applied not only for pretreatment but also as a method for frac-
tionation of lignocellulosic biomass. Fractionation of lignocellu-
losic biomass into lignin, carbohydrates, and other components
can be the ﬁrst step toward realization of bioreﬁnery. Alkaline
reagents used in pretreatment are highly selective for the separa-
tion of lignin. They can be used to recover a large fraction of lignin
with relatively high purity. Alkaline pretreatment retains more
hemicellulose than acidic or neutral pretreatments (dilute-acid or
steam treatment). Pretreatment using dilute acid or hot water is
effective for hemicellulose recovery. With proper selection of pre-
treatments and their operation sequence, effective fractionation
can be achieved. This is an important attribute of the bioreﬁnery
concept as it offers ﬂexibility in utilizing biomass. If alkaline treat-
ment is applied in the ﬁrst stage, low-lignin biomass and lignin are
obtained as the products. The lignin produced in alkaline pretreat-
ment is sulfur-free, unlike that produced by pulping processes
(Kim et al., 2009 ). Such lignin will then be used in further process-
ing. Fuel additives and bio-based polymers (adhesives and asphalt
extenders) are potential products ( Holladay et al., 2007 ).
If the fractionation of hemicellulose is achieved by acidic treat-
ment, its sugars (primarily xylose and its oligomers) are obtained
as second-stage products, which can be further converted intovalue-added products that include fuels and platform chemicals
(Werpy and Petersen, 2004 ). The solids remaining after hemicellu-
lose removal is glucan-rich biomass, which is a versatile feedstock
with numerous bioreﬁnery conversion applications.
Alkaline treatment of biomass gives another option for biomass
fractionation. Li and Kim (2011) reported that sequential two-step
enzymatic hydrolysis/fermentation (SSF), using xylanase and glu-
canase, can effectively produce glucan-rich and xylan-rich prod-
ucts. With this method, xylanase is used to produce xylose, and
then cellulase is used to produce glucose in the second stage. In
addition to the pretreatment methods by acids and bases, the
use of combined chemical reagents for alkaline pretreatment has
been attempted. For example, hydrogen peroxide and carbon diox-
ide have been tested as additional reagents ( Kim and Hong, 2000;
Kim and Lee, 1996; Kim et al., 2000; Tyson, 1991 ).
7. Conclusions
A variety of alkaline reagents have been used to improve enzy-
matic sacchariﬁcation of lignocellulose. Alkaline pretreatment has
been considered one of the most effective methods because it has
many advantages. These include effective deligniﬁcation, minimal
interaction with hemicellulose, and mild reaction conditions. In
addition, it is possible to recover and reuse many of the reagents
used in alkaline pretreatment. They are highly selective for separa-
tion of lignin. It is then anticipated that alkaline pretreatment
could play a critical role in the bioreﬁnery industry because it
can be used not only as a pretreatment but also as a method for
fractionation.
