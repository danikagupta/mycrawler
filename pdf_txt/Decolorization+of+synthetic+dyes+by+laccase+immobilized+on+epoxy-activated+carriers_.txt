The Myceliophthora thermophila  laccase was covalently immobilized on 
polymethacrylate-based polymers (Sepabeads EC-EP3 and Dilbeads NK) activated with 
epoxy groups. The enzyme immobilized on Sepabeads EC-EP3 exhibited notable activity (203 U/g) along with remarkably improved stability towards pH, temperature and storage time, but no increased resistance to organic solvents. In addition, the 
immobilized laccase also showed good operational stability, maintaining 84% of its 
initial activity after 17 cycles of oxidation of ABTS. The immobilized biocatalyst was applied to the decolorization of six synthetic dyes. Immobilized laccase retained 41% activity in the decolorization of Methyl Green in a fixed-bed reactor after five cycles. The features of these biocatalysts are very attractive for their application on the 
decolorization of dyes in the textile industry in batch and continuous fixed-bed 
bioreactors. To our knowledge, this is the first report on immobilization of laccase on Sepabeads carriers and its efficient dyes decolorization.

Synthetic dyes are extensively used in several industries including textile, paper, 
printing, 
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals [1]. There are many structural varieties of 
dyes respecting the type of chromophore (part of the molecule responsible for its 
colour), such as azo, anthraquinone, acridine, arylmethane, cyanine, phthalocyanine, nitro, nitroso, quinone-imine, thiazole or xanthene dyes. On the basis of dyeing process, textile dyes are classified as reactive dyes, direct dyes, disperse dyes, acid 
dyes, basic dyes and vat dyes. It is estimated that 10–15% of the dyes are lost in the 
effluent during dyeing process [2,3]. Many synthetic dyes are difficult to decolorize due to their complex structure. Decolorization of textile dye effluent does not occur when treated aerobically by municipal sewage systems [4]. Brightly colored, water-soluble reactive and acid dyes are the most problematic, as they tend to pass through 
conventional treatment systems unaffected [4]. Color can be removed from effluent by 
chemical and physical methods including adsorption, coagulation-flocculation, ion-exchange, oxidation and electrochemical methods [5,6]. The above ways for clean-up are expensive, which limit their application [7]. Dye decolorization is also achieved by routine anaerobic treatment of the effluents. However, reduction of azo dyes (up to 
50% of the total amount of dyes used in the textile industry) by the bacterial reductases 
produce uncoloured highly toxic aromatic amines. Alternatively, enzymatic oxidation 
of the dye using fungal oxidorreductases such as laccases has received great attention in recent years due to the efficient decolorization of the effluent [8-12]. 
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are blue multi-copper-containing enzymes that catalyze 
the oxidation of a variety of organic substances coupled to the reduction of molecular oxygen to water [13-15]. Because of their broad specificity for the reducing substrates, laccases from white-rot fungi are receiving increasing attention as potential industrial 4enzymes in various applications, such as pulp delignification, wood fiber modification, 
dye or stain bleaching, chemical or medicinal synthesis, and contaminated water or soil 
remediation [16]. Further, the presence of small molecular weight redox mediator 
enhances the range and the rates of compounds to be oxidized (including recalcitrant dyes) by the so-called laccase mediator system -LMS- [17]. Recently Camarero et al. [18] reported that some lignin-derived compounds served as eco-friendly laccase mediators that showed higher decolorization abilities against recalcitrant dyes than some 
synthetic mediators. Regardless of the nature of the mediator, several limitations 
prevent the use of free LMS for these applications. The stability and catalytic ability of free enzymes are dramatically decreased by highly polluted wastewaters; besides, mediator by-products can inactivate the laccase. The use of immobilized enzymes can overcome some of these limitations and provide stable catalysts with long life times. 
Taking into account that LMS works through the specific oxidation of the redox 
mediator, the immobilized laccase can be readily recovered for reuse. In particular, immobilization by covalent coupling retains very high enzyme activity and is effective in removing color and phenolic compounds over wide ranges of pH and temperature [19,20]. 
The purpose of the present study was to develop an effective method for the 
immobilization of laccase to decolorize an array of synthetic dyes in the presence of mediators. The specific objectives of the study were to (i) immobilize laccase on epoxy-activated acrylic polymers; (ii) determine the optimum pH and temperature, pH and thermal stability, storage stability, stability in organic solvents and re-usability of 
the immobilized laccase as compared to that of soluble enzyme; and (iii) evaluate the 
performance of the immobilized laccase in decolorization of synthetic dyes.52. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Materials 
Sepabeads EC-EP3 and Dilbeads NK were kindly donated by Resindion S.R.L 
(Mitsubishi 
Chemical Corporation, Milan, Italy) and DilComplex (Fermenta Biotech 
Ltd., India), respectively. Reactive Black 5 (RB −5), Acid Blue 25, Methyl Orange, 
Remazol 
Brilliant Blue B (RBBR), Methyl Green and Acid Green 27 were purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich. N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) and 2,2’-Azino-bis(3-
ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All 
other reagents were used of analytical grade. 
A DeniLite II S sample was kindly provided by Novozymes A/S. This formulation 
is commonly used in the textile industry in the finishing process for indigo-stained cloths. The laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) is produced by submerged fermentation of a 
genetically modified Aspergillus  microorganism [21] containing the laccase gene 
derived from Myceliophthora thermophila, using recombinant DNA techniques. 
2.2. Laccase immobilization
DeniLite II S was dissolved in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), centrifuged and
filtered 
to a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. The DeniLite II S working solution
(20 ml) was adjusted to pH 9.0 with 1 M sodium carbonate buffer, and mixed with
Sepabeads EC-EP3 or Dilbeads NK (1 g). Approximately 100 mg protein was added per gram of carrier. The suspension was incubated at room temperature with roller shaking for 24 h. The immobilized biocatalyst was then filtered through glass filter, washed (3 x 
15 ml) with 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), dried under vacuum, and stored at 
4C. 62.3. Textural characterization of immobilized biocatalysts
Mercury intrusion porosimetry analyses of the biocatalysts were performed using a 
Fisons Ins
truments Pascal 140/240 porosimeter; samples were dried at 100ºC overnight, 
prior to measurement. The specific surface area (S BET) of the supports was determined 
from analysis of nitrogen adsorption isotherms at –196°C using a Micromeritics ASAP 
2010 device, the samples were previously degassed at 100°C for 12 h to a residual vacuum of 5x10
-3 torr, to remove any loosely held adsorbed species. Water content of 
the supports was assayed using a DL31 Karl-Fisher titrator (Mettler). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using an XL3 microscope (Philips) on samples previously metallized with gold.
2.4. Enzyme assay and protein estimation
Standard laccase activity was determined by oxidation of ABTS at room 
temperature. 
The reaction solution was composed of 0.5 mM ABTS in 0.1 M sodium 
acetate buffer (pH 4.5). A suitable amount of enzyme was added, and the oxidation of 
ABTS was followed by measuring the absorbance increase at 418 nm (ε ABTS· + = 36,000 
M-1 cm-1). One unit of laccase activity corresponds to the oxidation of 1 mol 
ABTS/min under these conditions. For the determination of immobilized enzyme activity, 20 mg of biocatalyst was incubated in 1 ml reaction solution (0.5 mM ABTS) under continuous stirring. Aliquots were withdrawn at fixed time intervals and the rest 
of the procedure as described above.
Protein estimation of free laccase was performed using the method of Bradford (Bio-
Rad protein assay). The quantity of protein bound to the support was calculated by 
subtracting the protein recovered in the combined washing of the support-enzyme complex from the protein used for immobilization.72.5. Characterization of free and immobilized laccase
2.5.1. Optimum pH and pH stability
Laccase activity (free or immobilized) was assayed using 0.5 mM ABTS as substrate
in 
0.1 M citrate-phosphate and Tris-HCl buffers (pH 2.0–9.0) at 30°C. The effect of the 
pH on the enzyme stability was studied by incubating enzymes in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffers (pH 2.0–6.0) for 24 h at 30°C. Samples were transferred in standardreaction mixtures to determine the residual laccase activity with ABTS.
2.5.2. Optimum temperature and thermostability
The study was carried out at various temperatures (30º–80°C) and laccase activity 
was 
then assayed at the corresponding temperature in standard conditions. Thermal 
stability was determined by incubating free or immobilized laccases at the selected temperatures (60º and 70ºC) for different times. After cooling, laccase activity was 
assayed at 30°C in standard conditions with ABTS. 
2.5.3. Stability in organic solvents
The stability of the enzymes in organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, 
dimethylsulfoxide 
(DMSO) and acetonitrile) at different concentrations (10, 20, 30 and 
50% v/v) was measured by incubating free or immobilized enzyme in 1 ml of the 
solutions at 30ºC for 24 h. Initial and final enzyme activity was measured at 30 C. 
2.5.4. Storage stability 
For testing the storage stability of enzymes, free and immobilized laccases in 0.1 M 
sodium 
acetate buffer (pH 4.5) were stored in a refrigerator at 4 C for several days. 
Then the remaining activity of the enzyme was measured at 30°C
in standard conditions. 82.5.5. Reusability
Several consecutive oxidative cycles were performed using 0.5 mM ABTS in order 
to a
ssess the operating stability of the immobilized laccase. At the end of each oxidation 
cycle, the immobilized laccase (20 mg or 5 U) was washed three times with sodium 
acetate buffer and the procedure repeated with a fresh aliquot of substrate, as described by Davis and Burns [19]. 
2.6. Decolorization of synthetic dyes by immobilized laccase
Assays of decolorization of 0.02% (w/v) synthetic dyes (Fig. 1) were performed 
with 20 
U of immobilized laccase in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) with stirring 
(90 rpm) in 1 ml Eppendorf tube at 30 C. The reaction mixture was incubated for 24 h 
in 
the case of RB −5 and RBBR, and 6 h in the case of Acid Blue 25, Methyl Orange, 
Methyl 
Green, and Acid Green 27. The effect of redox mediator (1 mM HBT) on dyes 
decolorization was also investigated. 
Decreases in the absorbance maxima characteristic of RB −5(598 nm), RBBR (550 
nm), 
Acid Blue 25 (600 nm), Acid Green 27 (650 nm),  Methyl Green (630 nm) and 
Methyl Orange (470 nm) were measured at different incubation times, and the percentage of dye decolorization was calculated from these data. Absorption spectra between 300 and 800 nm were recorded during dye decolorization with or without mediator by use of UV-visible spectrophotometer (UVIKON, Kontron). In parallel, 
control samples were maintained without enzyme under similar conditions. 
2.7. Fixed-bed bioreactor
Methyl Green dye concentration was selected in order to obtain around 1.0 
absorbance 
unit at its maximum visible wavelength. Twenty five ml of dye solution 9were circulated through a column (5 cm x 1 cm) packed with immobilized laccase (0.5 
g) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Dye solution was continuously agitated with magnetic 
stirrer to assure proper oxygenation. After attaining the maximum decolorization of dye 
(6 h), the decolorized solution was replaced with fresh dye solution (25 ml) and the process was repeated for several batches. Samples collected after each cycle and the absorbance of the dye was measured. 103. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Immobilization of laccase on Sepabeads EC-EP3 and Dilbeads NK
When a protein is covalently linked to a support with a very high density of reactive 
groups, 
it was concluded that one must expect a multiple point attachment [22]. The 
immobilization of enzymes to epoxy-activated carriers is commonly carried out via 
multipoint covalent attachment at high ionic strength, because it has been postulated that, in a first step, a salt-induced association between the protein and the support 
surface takes place [23]. This interaction increases the effective concentration of 
nucleophilic groups on the enzyme close to the epoxide reactive sites. The epoxy (oxirane) groups may react with different nucleophiles of the protein as a function of pH. At neutral or slightly alkaline pH, with the thiol groups; at pH > 9, with the amino groups; at pH > 11, with phenolic groups of tyrosines; at slightly acidic pH, with 
carboxyl groups [24]. Although the type of residues involved may affect the enzyme 
orientation on the solid support, it has been recently demonstrated by Wilchek and Miron [25] that there is little difference in biocatalyst performance when using random or oriented immobilization. In the present study, the laccase from M. thermophila  was 
immobilized 
on two acrylic epoxy-activated polymers, Sepabeads EC-EP3 and Dilbeads 
NK. The main properties of these carriers are summarized in Table 1. As shown, 
Sepabeads EC-EP3 exhibits higher porosity and approximately double pore size than 
Dilbeads NK. Nevertheless, both carriers have a pore structure suitable to accommodate biomolecules. The particle size is not uniform for these supports, as shown in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures of Fig. 2, in which the pore structure of both 
carriers is clearly different. 
The activity towards ABTS of the M. thermophila working solution was 28 
U/mg 
protein. In order to bind the enzyme to the support using different functional 11groups, the immobilization was performed at pH 9.0, adjusting the pH of soluble 
laccase with sodium carbonate. At pH 9.0, the amino and thiol groups in the protein are 
able to bind to the support. The buffer concentration used was 1.0 M. The amount of 
total protein “offered” per gram of support was 100 mg. 
As shown in Table 2, the amount of protein bound to Sepabeads EC-EP3 was 
almost 2-fold higher than the obtained with Dilbeads NK. The higher activity of the biocatalyst (203 U/g) was achieved with Sepabeads EC-EP3 than with Dilbeads NK (91 
U/g). These results are promising-keeping in mind that the M. thermophila laccase 
expressed 
in A. oryzae is hyper-glycosylated by the eukaryotic host which may avoid 
higher 
number interactions between the enzyme surface and the activated carrier. 
Although laccase has been immobilized by different techniques, such as adsorption 
[26], entrapment [27] or covalent attachment [19], biocatalyst activity per mass unit is 
not commonly reported. However, Yinghui et al. [28] described a maximum activity of 
1.2 U/g for laccase from Panus conchatus covalently attached to activated polyvinyl 
alcohol carrier. 
3.2. Characterization of immobilized laccase 
As the specific activity of laccase immobilized in Sepabeads EC3 was higher than in 
Dilbeads NK, we selected 
the former biocatalyst for further characterization studies. 
3.2.1. Optimum pH and pH stability
The activity/pH profile of the immobilized laccase was not displaced as predicted 
from 
the neutral nature of the support (Fig. 3). Both the free and immobilized laccase 
exhibited maximal activity at pH 3.0 and negligible activity above pH 7.0. The pH stability of free and immobilized laccase was determined over the restricted range 2.0–126.0. In general immobilized laccase exhibited higher stability than the free counterpart 
(Fig. 4), specially in the pH range 3.0–5.0.
3.2.2. Optimum temperature and thermostability
The activity/temperature profile of the soluble and immobilized enzyme showed the 
optimum 
of 60°C (Fig. 5A). In addition, immobilization resulted in a slight broadening 
of the curve at high temperatures, in agreement with other investigations [29-32]. At 
75° and 80°C, immobilized laccase displayed a relative activity of 72 and 48%, 
respectively, whereas the activity decay of the free enzyme was more significant at 
these temperatures (59 and 37% relative activity, respectively). 
The thermal stability is one of the most important features for the application of 
the biocatalyst. The immobilization of an enzyme to a carrier often limits its freedom to undergo drastic conformational changes, thus resulting in increased stability towards 
denaturation [19,29,30,33]. In the present study, laccase immobilization led to a 
significant stabilizing effect towards heat denaturation at 60 and 70°C (Fig. 5B). The stability at the above temperatures was increased respectively 15 and 10% in the immobilized enzyme, relative to the free one. The enhanced thermal stability of laccase arising from immobilization would be an advantage for its industrial application due to 
the high temperatures used in the industrial processes [32,34]. 
3.2.3. Stability in organic solvents
The effect of organic solvents on laccase activity has been reported [35-37]. 
Generally, 
laccases decrease their activity as concentrations of water-miscible solvents 
increase, and in most reported cases, immobilized laccase shows higher activity than the free enzyme at different organic solvents concentrations. Nevertheless, both free 
and immobilized laccases from Cerrena unicolor  and Coriolodopsis gallica were not 
stable 
at concentration higher than 20% [35-37]. These results are reasonably 13consistent with our results (cf. Table 3), in which different concentrations of organic 
solvents caused no significant differences for immobilized laccase and free 
preparations. The highest stability is observed for both soluble and immobilized 
laccase when using DMSO and ethanol as organic solvents. 
3.2.4. Storage stability 
Laccase immobilized on Sepabeads EC-EP3 maintained significant activity during 
storage at 4°C in 0.1 M sodi
um acetate buffer pH 4.5. During the first 2 months storage 
period there was a 2.5% drop in activity. Thereafter, the activity declined more slowly 
loosing an additional 1.3% in 2 months, equivalent to an approximate loss of 0.03% per day over the latter period and to a total loss of 3.8% in 4 months. Under the same storage conditions, the recovered activity of the soluble laccase amounted to 95 and 91% after 2 and 4 months storage, respectively. Leonowicz and co-workers [30]
reported an increase in storage stability of laccase from Trametes versicolor
immobilized on glutaraldehyde-activated aminopropyl porous glass. 
3.2.5. Reusability
The reusability of the laccase immobilized on Sepabeads EC-EP3 was also studied 
because 
of its importance for industry to reduce the processing costs. Fig. 6 clearly 
illustrates that immobilized laccase oxidized 17 batches of 0.5 mM ABTS while 
retaining 84% initial activity. Successful reuse of various immobilized laccase systems 
has been reported by other investigators [19,30,38].
3.3. Decolorization of dyes by immobilized laccase
We selected several dyes from the groups of diazo (RB −5), triarylmethane
(Methyl 
Green), azo (Methyl Orange) and anthraquinone (Acid Green 27, Acid Blue 25 
and RBBR) dyes to evaluate the enzymatic decolorization activity by the M. 14thermophila laccase immobilized on Sepabeads EC-EP3. The results showed a high 
decolorization 
capacity of laccase immobilized on Sepabeads (Figs. 7-8). In the case of 
RB−5 there was no decolorization with immobilized enzyme alone. The high redox 
potential 
of the dye (1.4 V), together with steric hindrances reducing the accessibility of 
the –NH 2 and –OH groups, prevent the oxidation of the dye by laccase as observed 
previously with high redox potential laccases [18] or with Mn-mediated peroxidase 
activity [39]. However, in the presence of redox mediator (HBT) the immobilized 
enzyme exhibited efficient decolorization (60%) after 24 h. Murugesan et al. [3] found a 
similar result with RB-5 using laccase from Pleurotus sajor-caju . The probable reason 
is 
that the dyes containing –NH2 and –OH groups are most vulnerable by laccase 
attack; however, in RB-5, the steric hindrance may reduce the accessibility of these groups to laccases [18]. Recently, Camarero et al. [18] have reported that several lignin 
derived phenols of natural origin act as efficient redox mediators in the decolorization 
of RB-5. 
Decolorization of the anthraquinone dye RBBR was not achieved by Denilite II as 
previously reported [40,41] and in concordance with what occur with most laccases. On the contrary, Pycnoporus  laccases posses high efficiency in decolorizing RBBR [18,42].
In 
the presence of HBT as redox mediator maximum decolorization of 31% was 
achieved after 24 h. In contrast, the other anthraquinone dyes assayed (Acid Blue 25 and Acid Green 27) could be directly decolorized by immobilized enzyme. In the presence of HBT as redox mediator, there was no appreciable change in decolorization of these dyes. The immobilized enzyme also showed that there was no appreciable change in the 
decolorization of triarymethane dye Methyl Green (75%) within 6 h with or without 
redox mediator. In the case of azo dye Methyl Orange, the immobilized enzyme showed 61% decolorization during 6 h incubation without HBT. However, the addition of 1 mM 15HBT enhanced the decolorization nearly to 1.3-fold and the maximum decolorization of 
82% was observed within 6 h (Fig. 8). Efficient decolorization was confirmed by UV-
Visible spectroscopy showing a general decrease in dye adsorption in the 300 to 800 nm 
region (Fig. 7). 
3.4. Fixed-bed reactor
The advantage of immobilized laccase lies not only in the increase of stability, but 
also 
in its reusability [32,43]. Experiments showed that the immobilized laccase on 
Sepabeads EC-EP3 could be reused 5 cycles for the decolorization of Methyl Green
(Fig. 9). The immobilized laccase retained more than 41% of its initial activity after five batch uses. The activity loss in subsequent steps may be related with enzyme inactivation.  The result revealed that immobilized laccase has potential application in 
dyestuff treatment [44].164. CONCLUSIONS
Based on above results, the performance of the immobilized biocatalysts described 
in 
this work was satisfactory. Their high mechanical stability and absence of swelling 
in water converts them into very interesting alternatives for dye degradation in the 
textile industry, compared with other related carriers. In addition, immobilisation of laccase from DeniLite II S on epoxy-activated Sepabeads acrylic polymers is simple and easily scaleable. The use of the above biocatalysts for the batch and continuous 
decolorization of industrial dyes in a fixed-bed reactor is currently being studied. The 
improved stability and reusability of immobilized laccase could be a potential advantage in wastewater treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report on immobilization of laccase on Sepabeads carriers and its efficient dyes decolorization.
