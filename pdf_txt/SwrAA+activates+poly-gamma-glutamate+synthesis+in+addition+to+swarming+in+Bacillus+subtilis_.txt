 ABSTRACT   13 
 SwrA activates flagellar gene expression in Bacillus subtilis  to increase the frequency of 14 
motile cells in liquid and elevate flagellar density to enable swarming over solid surfaces.  Here 15 
we use ChIP-seq to show that SwrA interacts with many sites on the chromosome in a manner 16 
that depends on the response regulator DegU.  We identify a Deg U-specific inverted repeat 17 
DNA sequence and show that SwrA synergizes with phosphorylation  to increase DegU DNA 18 
binding affinity.  We further show that SwrA increases the size of the DegU footprint expanding 19 
the region bound by DegU towards the promoter.  The location of the DegU inverted repeat was 20 
critical and moving the binding site closer to the promoter impaired transcription more that could 21 
be explained by deactivation.  We conclude that SwrA/DegU forms a heteromeric complex that 22 
enables both remote binding and interaction between the activator and RNA polymerase in the 23 
context of an interceding UP element.  We speculate that multim eric activators that resolve cis- 24 
element spatial conflicts are common in bacteria and likely act  on flagellar biosynthesis loci and 25 
other long operons of other multi-subunit complexes.   26

 IMPORTANCE 29 
 In Bacteria, the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase recognizes spe cific DNA sequences 30 
called promoters that determine where gene transcription begins .  Some promoters also have 31 
sequences immediately upstream called an UP element that is bou nd by the alpha subunit of 32 
RNA polymerase and is often necessary for transcription.  Final ly, promoters may be activated 33 
by transcription factors that bind DNA specific sequences and help recruit RNA polymerase to 34 
weak promoter elements.  Here we show that the promoter for the  32 gene long flagellar operon 35 
in Bacillus subtilis  requires an UP element and is activated by a heteromeric trans cription factor 36 
of DegU and SwrA.  Our evidence suggests that SwrA oligomerizes  DegU over the DNA to 37 
allow RNA polymerase to interact with DegU and the UP element s imultaneously.  Heteromeric 38 
activator complexes are known but poorly-understood in bacteria and we speculate they may be 39 
needed to resolve spatial conflicts in the DNA sequence. 40

 INTRODUCTION 49 
 Bacterial flagella are complex, multi-subunit, trans-envelope m achines that propel cells 50 
to swim in liquid or swarm over solid surfaces.  Flagella are composed of dozens of different 51 
subunits, expressed in a series of hierarchical stages roughly corresponding to the order in 52 
which the subunits are assembled (1-4).  The top of the hierarchy is often a transcription factor 53 
called a master regulator that directly enhances the expression  of the earliest genes in flagellar 54 
synthesis.  Mutation of the master regulator tends to impair or  abolish motility while over- 55 
expression of the master regulator can lead to hyper-flagellati on and, in some systems, promote 56 
swarming motility (5).  Master regulators bind upstream of one or more promoters in the flagellar 57 
regulon and often require the formation of heteromeric, multiprotein complexes (6-8).  While 58 
clearly important for motility gene expression, these master regulators are among the most 59 
species-specific and the least-studied components of the hierarchy.   60 
In Bacillus subtilis, the master flagellar regulator is SwrA, a small (117 amino acid ), 61 
positively-charged protein that is narrowly-conserved in a clos ely-related subset of species 62 
within the genus Bacillus  (9,10).  First discovered as a factor required for swarming but not 63 
swimming motility (9), SwrA activates the constitutive Pflache promoter of the 32-gene long fla/che  64 
operon encoding early-stage flagellar biosynthesis components, over a relatively narrow (~4- 65 
fold) range (11-14).  Moderate SwrA levels support a high frequency of swimming cells in liquid 66 
and SwrA levels increase on a surface for enhanced flagellar sy nthesis to support swarming 67 
motility (13; 15-17).  The mechanism by which SwrA enhances Pflache promoter activity is poorly- 68 
understood but SwrA has been shown interact with the DNA bindin g protein DegU (14, 18-20). 69 
DegU is a response regulator that functions as a transcription factor.  Cells lacking DegU 70 
have pleiotropic phenotypes that include defects in genetic competence, exoprotease 71 
production, exopolymer production, biofilm formation, and motil ity (21-30).  A consensus binding 72 
sequence for DegU has not been determined and the mechanism by which DegU differentially 73 
regulates the wide variety of targets under its control is poor ly-understood (31,32).  DegU binds 74 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 DNA in both phosphorylated and unphosporylated forms and each may bind targets differently 75 
(14,25,33-35).  DegU is phosphorylated either by its cognate so luble kinase DegS (36,37) or by 76 
the small metabolite acetyl phosphate (38) and two small protei ns DegQ and DegR enhance the 77 
phosphorylated state (25,39).  Finally, SwrA binds to the DegU receiver domain and may alter 78 
DegU’s DNA binding activity (19,20).  Consistent with being a m odulator of DegU function, cells 79 
lacking SwrA have phenotypes beyond defects in motility, many of which overlap with cells 80 
lacking DegU (40-42).   81 
Here we characterized SwrA association with the chromosome usin g Chromatin 82 
immunoprecipitation coupled to deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) and found that SwrA is enriched at 83 
DNA sequences in a manner that depends on DegU.  SwrA enhanced DegU binding at a variety 84 
of target sites in vitro  with the highest affinity displayed at Pflache, consistent with genetic results 85 
suggesting that it was the primary biological SwrA target (13).  Despite extensive sequence 86 
analysis, no SwrA or DegU consensus site was detected bioinformatically, but a perfect 5-8-5 87 
inverted repeat within Pflache was shown to be required for SwrA/DegU binding and activity.  88 
SwrA interaction synergized with phosphorylation to increase De gU’s DNA binding affinity and 89 
expanded the DegU binding site lik ely by inducing DegU oligomer ization.  Inverted repeat 90 
location was critical and moving the repeat closer to the promo ter abolished promoter activity by 91 
disrupting a cis-acting UP element.  Thus we suggest that DegU oligomerization induced by 92 
SwrA is necessary to allow both the remote binding of DegU and interaction with RNA 93 
polymerase at the promoter.  Complex heteromeric activators may  be generally required for 94 
promoters with UP elements, and we speculate that a number of p oorly-understood 95 
transcriptional modulators may act enabling the transcription f actor to contact RNA polymerase 96 
without interfering with, or otherwise occluding, UP elements. 97

 RESULTS 100 
SwrA interacts with DNA indirectly.  SwrA is the master regulator of motility in B. 101 
subtilis,  and SwrA activates the Pflache promoter that controls 32 genes involved in flagellar 102 
assembly and chemotaxis (13,14).  Other targets of SwrA have be en reported but the extent of 103 
the SwrA regulon, and the mechanism of SwrA-mediated transcript ional activation are poorly- 104 
understood (13,19,20,41,42).  To investigate whether SwrA assoc iates with DNA in vivo , we 105 
performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to deep sequenc ing (ChIP-Seq) on wild type 106 
and swrA mutant cells. Cultures were treated with formaldehyde, and aft er lysis and DNA 107 
fragmentation, SwrA was immunoprecipitated with antibodies rais ed against the full-length 108 
protein. After reversing the crosslinks, the DNA associated with SwrA was subjected to next 109 
generation sequencing. Chromatin immuno-enrichment was calculated as the ratio of ChIP-Seq 110 
signal to genomic DNA plotted as peaks in 1 kb windows that spanned the entire genome. SwrA 111 
candidate binding sites were defined as peaks that were enriche d in wild type replicates but not 112 
in the swrA mutant control (Fig 1A ).  113 
SwrA was enrichment at thirty-four genomic locations and all bu t two were located in 114 
intergenic regions consistent with possible promoters ( Table S1 ).  To investigate whether SwrA 115 
affected transcription of the neighboring genes, 13 promoter re gions containing strongly- 116 
enriched peaks ( Pflache, PflgM, PswrA, PyxjJ, PmcpA, PycdC, PyneI, PytvA, PydaJ, PywdA, PyweA, PtlpA, and 117 
PsacX) were cloned upstream of the lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase, and β-galactosidase 118 
activity was measured in various genetic backgrounds.  As antic ipated, expression of Pflache-lacZ  119 
decreased relative to wild type in cells lacking SwrA, and increased when was overexpressed, 120 
consistent with previous reports (Fig 2A ) (13,14).  The remaining reporters responded to the 121 
presence and absence of SwrA in a variety of ways.  Expression from four promoters, P flgM, 122 
PswrA, PyxjJ, and P mcpA was reduced ~2-fold in a swrA deletion and increased ~2-fold when swrA 123 
was artificially overexpressed in a manner that was similar to Pflache (Fig 2A ).  Five promoters, 124 
PyneI, PytvA, PydaJ, PywdA, and  PyweA produced low but detectable levels of LacZ activity that was 125 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 not altered by either mutation or overexpression of swrA ( Fig 2A ).  Finally, three promoters, 126 
PtlpA, PycdC and P sacX, produced no activity above background (<2 Miller units, MU) in any strain 127 
and were omitted from the study.  We conclude that while ChIP-S eq indicated SwrA-enrichment 128 
of several promoter regions, enrichment did not necessarily reflect an effect of SwrA on reporter 129 
expression.  We further conclude that SwrA either directly or i ndirectly activated the P fla/che, PflgM, 130 
PswrA, PyxjJ, and P mcpA promoters. 131 
One way in which SwrA could enrich target promoter regions is by binding directly to 132 
DNA.  To determine whether SwrA bound DNA directly, electrophor etic mobility shift assays 133 
(EMSA) were performed on seven different promoter regions.  The  Pflache promoter was chosen 134 
as a known SwrA target and P flgM, PyxjJ, PswrA, and P yneI were added as candidates from the 135 
present study.  Two negative controls were included: the promot er P comK expressing the gene for  136 
the master activator of competence gene expression ComK, and th e promoter Phag expressing 137 
the gene for the flagellar filament protein Hag.  The seven dif ferent promoter fragments were 138 
PCR amplified, radiolabeled, incubated with purified SwrA prote in at a range of protein 139 
concentrations, resolved by native gel electrophoresis and anal yzed by phosphorimager.  In 140 
each case, addition of SwrA failed to alter migration of the ra diolabeled DNA fragment except at 141 
the highest concentration of SwrA added (1 μM) ( Fig S1 ).  These data argue that SwrA is not 142 
sufficient for DNA binding. 143 
 144 
SwrA-DNA interaction is DegU-dependent.   Current evidence suggests that SwrA interacts 145 
with the P flache promoter indirectly by interacting with the response regulator  DegU (19,20).  146 
Consistent a requirement of both proteins for DNA binding, cell s lacking either SwrA or DegU 147 
are defective in swarming motility even when the remaining prot ein was artificially 148 
overexpressed (Fig S2 ) (9,20,25,26,43).  To test whether DegU is required for SwrA's  149 
association with DNA, we repeated the SwrA ChIP-Seq in a degU  mutant strain. In the absence 150 
of DegU , all SwrA-dependent peaks were abolished (Fig 1A ). Furthermore, the degU  mutation 151 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 reduced the expression of the SwrA target promoters Pflache, PflgM, PswrA, PyxjJ, and P mcpA to levels 152 
similar to that observed in a swrA mutant, and SwrA overexpression failed to activate these 153 
promoters ( Fig 2B ).  We conclude that SwrA association with DNA and transcriptional activation 154 
of SwrA-responsive promoters are entirely dependent on the pres ence of DegU .    155 
  To investigate whether SwrA alters DegU DNA binding specifici ty, we performed ChIP- 156 
seq using a DegU antibody.  DegU was enriched at 46 locations, many of which were upstream 157 
of genes involved in motility, c ompetence, biofilm formation as well as genes of unknown 158 
function (Fig 1B;  Table S1 ) (44).  All 34 SwrA-enriched regions were also enriched in the D egU 159 
ChIP-seq (Fig 1C, Fig S3A ). Furthermore, in cells lacking SwrA, there was a general reduction 160 
enrichment in the DegU ChIP-seq ( Fig 1B,1C ).  Peaks were sorted into three different DegU- 161 
ChIP classes depending on the effect of SwrA on enrichment ( Table S1 ).   Class I targets (61%) 162 
were SwrA-dependent as they were abolished in the absence of Sw rA.  Class II targets (11%) 163 
were SwrA-enhanced as they were reduced but not abolished when SwrA was absent.  Class III 164 
targets (28%) were SwrA-independent as they appeared unaffected  by its absence.  We 165 
conclude that three-quarters of the DegU-enriched promoters wer e either enhanced by, or fully 166 
dependent on, the presence of SwrA.  Therefore, SwrA potentiate s binding of DegU to a subset 167 
of promoters in its regulon.   168 
In an effort to determine a consensus binding site for DegU, 200 base pair fragments 169 
surrounding each ChIP-seq peak center were compiled and subject ed to MEME sequence 170 
pattern analysis (45).  Combining sequences from all DegU peaks  indicated an enriched 171 
sequence that did not contain a repeat element as might be expected for a response regulator 172 
DNA binding sequence ( Fig S4 ).  Separate analysis of the cla ss I, class II and class III De gU 173 
ChIP peaks, provided similarly-enriched sequences ( Fig S4 ).  We wondered whether our data 174 
set might be incomplete due to the absence of peaks located nea r the characterized DegU- 175 
regulated promoters: P aprE and P pgsB directing alkaline protease and poly-γ-glutamate synthesis 176 
respectively (Fig S3B ) (27,41,46-48). Accordingly, we performed a DegU ChIP-seq by i mmune- 177 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 precipitating DegU from a strain overexpressing the small phosp hor-enhancer protein DegQ and 178 
a strain expressing the hyper-active DegU allele, DegUhy32 (21,25,33).  Both the DegQ 179 
overproduction ( Fig S5A, Table S2) and DegUhy32 (Fig S5B, Table S3) strains identified 180 
additional peaks that were SwrA-enhanced, but MEME analysis of each dataset still produced 181 
an asymmetric DegU target sequence similar to that of the wild type (Fig S4 ).   Moreover, 182 
sequence analysis did not indicate how SwrA was differentiating a subset of the DegU peaks for 183 
enrichment and there appeared to be no SwrA-specifying sequence  in the DNA.   184 
 185 
SwrA increases DegU affinity for DNA and expands the DegU bindi ng site.   To better 186 
understand the mechanism of SwrA-mediated DegU activation, DegU  EMSAs were conducted 187 
on the same series of promoters previously used to test for dir ect interaction by SwrA.  DegU 188 
bound poorly to each promoter but an electrophoretic mobility s hift was observed with Pflache 189 
when DegU was phosphorylated by ATP and its cognate kinase, Deg S (Fig S1 ) (14,25).  Thus, 190 
the P flache promoter seemed to contain the highest affinity binding site of those tested, and we 191 
note that previously studied promoters like PflgM and P comK, bound by DegU-P and DegU 192 
respectively, require higher concentrations than used here (34,49).  Next, the concentration of 193 
either DegU or DegU-P was held constant and increasing amounts of SwrA were added to the 194 
reaction.  The presence of SwrA caused a supershift of the P flache promoter and did so at lower 195 
concentrations when DegU was phosphorylated ( Fig 3).  Moreover, the presence of SwrA 196 
induced a shift of all promoters except the non-predicted targe t Phag, suggesting that SwrA 197 
generally enhanced the affinity of DegU-P for its targets.  198 
To explore the effect of SwrA on DegU DNA binding activity, the  concentration of SwrA 199 
was held constant, and EMSA experiments were conducted in tripl icate on P flache with increasing 200 
amounts of DegU and DegU-P.  Addition of SwrA caused diffuse su pershifted bands making it 201 
difficult to quantify the densitometry of the bound state.  Therefore, we calculated the fraction of 202 
the unbound state and subtracted the value from 1.  Phosphorylation of DegU increased DNA 203 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 binding affinity by 10-fold (Fig 4A,B ).  SwrA increased the binding affinity of DegU ( Fig 4A ) and 204 
DegU-P (Fig 4B ) by approximately 10-fold and 4-fold respectively, suggesting that SwrA affinity 205 
enhancement was phosphorylation independent ( Fig 4 ).  High levels of SwrA caused smearing 206 
of the band signal even for non-target promoters like Phag but did so with a K d much higher than 207 
observed for Pflache (Fig 4C ).   While ChIP-seq is non-quantitative, we note SwrA-enhanceme nt 208 
of DegU DNA binding is consistent with the in vivo  global reduction in DegU enrichment in the 209 
absence of SwrA (Fig 1B ).  We conclude that SwrA interacts with DegU and synergizes with 210 
phosphorylation to enhance DNA binding.  211 
To further explore the effect of SwrA on DegU-P, DNAse I protec tion assays were 212 
conducted on the Pflache (Fig 5A ) and PyxjJ (Fig 5B ) promoters.  DegU-P protected a region of the 213 
Pflache promoter 40 base pairs (bp) upstream of the -35 box (Fig 5A ).  Centered within the 214 
protected region was a perfect 5-8-5 inverted repeat of CTAGG separated by an intervening 8 215 
base pairs ( Fig 5C ).  Addition of SwrA to the reaction expanded the protection to both the left 216 
and right of the repeat thereby increasing the total protected area to approximately 70 bp.  217 
DegU-P alone did not provide DNAse I protection of PyxjJ at the concentration used, and while 218 
the location of the PyxjJ promoter is unknown, addition of SwrA induced protection again  with a 219 
width of approximately 70 bp ( Fig 5B ).  We conclude that SwrA alters the way in which DegU-P 220 
binds DNA and creates a wide footprint of DNase I protection at  multiple promoters.  221 
The consensus sequence to which DegU-P binds is poorly-understood and we focused 222 
our attention on the putative 5-8-5 inverted repeat within the Pflache promoter.  To test whether 223 
the inverted repeat element was important for SwrA/DegU-depende nt activation, two bases 224 
were changed in each half site of the repeat separately and together at the native site in the 225 
chromosome.  Mutation of either the promoter distal site (site 1) or the promoter proximal site 226 
(site 2) had little effect on swarming motility but mutation of  both sites simultaneously caused a 227 
severe defect ( Fig 6A ).  Overexpression of SwrA shortened the lag period of the sing le mutants 228 
and restored partial swarming to the double mutant.  Moreover, EMSA indicated that mutation of 229 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 both sites simultaneously abolished and dramatically reduced binding of DegU-P in the absence 230 
and presence of SwrA respectively ( Fig 4D ).  Finally, consistent with an important regulatory 231 
element, the sequence upstream of the Pflache promoter, including the putative 5-8-5 repeat, was 232 
highly-conserved in a wide variety of B. subtilis  relatives that also encoded SwrA and DegU ( Fig 233 
5C) and conservation degraded farther upstream (Fig S6 ).  We conclude that the conserved 234 
inverted repeat protected in the DegU-P DNase I protection assa y is required for SwrA/DegU- 235 
dependent activation of Pflache.  236 
We noted that the 5-8-5 inverted repeat was part of the consens us sequence predicted 237 
by MEME analysis but the actual output emphasized the thymine-e nriched spacer between the 238 
repeats rather than the repeats themselves ( Fig S4).  We wondered why the intervening 239 
sequence was so highly-conserved and homopolymer replacements were made to test its 240 
importance.  When six of the spacer residues were changed to ei ther all adenines (A) or all 241 
thymines (T), no change on swarming motility was observed and o verexpression of SwrA 242 
shortened the lag period like wild type ( Fig 6B ).  When the residues were changed to all 243 
guanines (G), swarming was severely impaired but in a way that could be rescued by SwrA 244 
overexpression.  When the residues were changed to all cytosine s (C) swarming motility was 245 
abolished and overexpression of SwrA had little effect.  We conclude that the nature of the 246 
sequence between the inverted repeats is relevant insofar as on ly an A-T rich sequence is 247 
tolerated for full functionality. 248 
 DegU-P bound to the 5-8-5 repeat but did not activate expressi on until the presence of 249 
SwrA widened the region of protection.  We wondered whether the  effectiveness of the 5-8-5 250 
repeat was dependent on the distance from the -35 box.  To test  position-dependence, the 251 
repeat was moved towards (by deletion) and away (by insertion o f randomized sequence) from 252 
the promoter by full helical turns of the DNA (10 bp) to maintain register with the promoter ( Fig 253 
S7).  Movement of the repeat 20 and 10 bases father away (-20 and  -10) abolished and reduced 254 
swarming respectively (Fig 6C ).  Overexpression of SwrA however was able to enhance 255 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 swarming of the -10 reposition.  Moving the repeat 10 and 20 ba ses closer to the promoter (+10 256 
and +20), abolished swarming in a manner that could not be rescued by SwrA overexpression 257 
(Fig 6C ).  We conclude that the position of the DegU binding site is i mportant and moving it 258 
from its current location impairs swarming motility.  Moreover,  the strain containing the DegU 259 
binding site shifted 20 base pairs closer to the promoter also exhibited mucoid colonies on 260 
plates and was difficult to pellet in liquid suggesting additio nal phenotypic effects.  We infer that 261 
SwrA expansion of the DegU binding site is likely important to bring the activation complex 262 
closer to the promoter, but additional sequence elements may be  important for P flache 263 
expression.   264 
 The mucoid colony and loose pellet of the strains in which the DegU binding site was 265 
moved 20 closer to the promoter was consistent with the phenoty pe of a SigD mutant, and SigD 266 
is encoded at the 3’ end of the fla/che  operon under Pflache control (11,12,50-52).  To measure 267 
SigD activity, a reporter in which the SigD-dependent Phag-promoter was transcriptionally fused 268 
to the gene encoding green fluorescent protein ( gfp) and introduced at an ectopic site in a 269 
variety of strains (13).  Wild type exhibited a high frequency of brightly fluorescent P hag ON cells 270 
with rare dark Phag OFF cells (Fig 7) .  Mutation of either SwrA or DegU decreased the frequency 271 
of Phag ON cells, with OFF cells growing as long chains, whereas mutat ion of SigD abolished 272 
ON cell production and cell chains were ubiquitous ( Fig 7 ).  Strains in which the DegU binding 273 
site was moved 20 or 10 base pairs farther away (+20 and +10) o r 10 base pairs closer (-10) to 274 
the promoter produced populations similar to that of either the  SwrA or DegU mutant, consistent 275 
with the inability of the protein complex to activate the Pflache promoter properly (Fig 7) .  The 276 
strain that moved the DegU binding site 20 base pairs closer ho wever, produced a population 277 
similar to that of the SigD mutant, indicating a more severe de fect in Pflache promoter activity than 278 
could be explained simply by impairment of SwrA/DegU (Fig 7) .  SwrA/DegU did not become 279 
inhibitory when the DegU binding site was moved 20 base pairs c loser as mutation of either 280

 closely related species indicated a high degree of conservation  including homopolymeric A and 282 
T tracts resembling a promoter-enhancing UP element (Fig 5C, Table S8)  (53-56).  We 283 
conclude that DegU likely evolved to bind as close to the Pflache promoter as possible while 284 
maintaining an UP element constrained to reside immediately adjacent to the -35 box.  In order 285 
to function as an activator however, an additional factor SwrA was required to expand DegU 286 
binding epigenetically closer to the promoter and enhance inter action with RNA polymerase ( Fig 287

 DISCUSSION 289 
SwrA is a poorly-understood transcriptional activator, which wh ile conserved in close 290 
relatives of Bacillus subtilis , is mutated in most commonly-used laboratory strains (9,40,57- 59).  291 
How SwrA activates gene expression is unknown but recent work has indicated that SwrA 292 
modifies the function of the response regulator DegU (19,20,42) .  Here we took a global ChIP- 293 
seq approach to show that SwrA interacts with DNA indirectly at  a subset of DegU binding sites.  294 
The DNA binding consensus of DegU is unknown but by focusing on one of the strongest 295 
targets, the Pflache promoter, we found an inverted repeat that DegU bound with high affinity.  296 
Moreover, addition of SwrA synergized with phosphorylation to e nhance DegU DNA binding 297 
affinity and caused DegU to protect a region larger than the inverted repeat.  We hypothesize 298 
that the inverted repeat in Pflache  represents the DegU consensus binding site and that SwrA- 299 
induced DegU oligomerization that may permit binding at other s ites in the chromosome where 300 
consensus conservation is poor.  Moreover, we suggest that SwrA  functions as a co-activator to 301 
allow DegU to bind DNA far from the promoter while permitting contact with RNA polymerase.  302 
 The paradigm of transcriptional activators was established with the pleiotropic CAP/CRP 303 
protein of E. coli (60,61).  Briefly, CAP binds as a dimer to an inverted repeat sequence (62-64) 304 
upstream of a weak promoter and increases RNA polymerase recrui tment (65-66) by interaction 305 
with the C-terminal domain of α subunit (α-CTD) (67-68).  The l ocation of the CAP binding site is 306 
important, such that if the CAP site is relocated too far from,  too close to, or on the opposite 307 
face of DNA from the -35 box, activation is impaired (69-72).   Like CAP, DegU is a dimeric, 308 
pleiotropic, regulatory protein that binds to an inverted repeat sequence upstream of the Pflache 309 
promoter.  DegU binding to Pflache however was not sufficient and required an additional protein 310 
SwrA to increase expression approx imately four-fold.  Moreover,  moving the DegU binding site 311 
towards the P flache promoter caused a near complete failure of expression, a stronger defect 312 
than mere deactivation.  Thus, SwrA and DegU not only activates  expression of the Pflache 313 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 promoter but must do so in a way that accommodates a critical c is element that intercedes 314 
between the promoter and the binding site. 315 
 The Pflache promoter-proximal cis-acting sequence is likely an UP element.   UP elements 316 
are sequences rich in adenine and thymine bases located immedia tely upstream of the -35 box 317 
of certain promoters (53,54,56), and either increase RNA polymerase stability at the promoter, 318 
or control open complex formation to initiate transcription (53,54,73,74). We note that the 319 
sequence immediately upstream of Pflache is A-T rich, highly-conserved in related species and 320 
very similar to previously-characterized UP elements that enhan ce the flagella-related Phag and 321 
PfliD promoters in B. subtilis  (55,75-77).  The failure of the degU  binding site to stimulate Pflache 322 
when moved closer to the -35 box suggests that the SwrA/DegU co mplex cannot substitute for 323 
the UP element and that the two serve different functions in promoting transcription.  The 324 
presence of DegU/SwrA likely increases affinity of RNA polymera se for the promoter, while the 325 
UP element is critical for expression and may function in open complex formation.  If this is the 326 
case, DegU evolved to bind as close to the promoter as possible while not interrupting the UP 327 
element, and SwrA extends the reach of DegU. 328 
 We infer that SwrA expands the region of protection on Pflache by changing the oligomeric 329 
state of the DegU response regulator.  There is no evidence tha t SwrA interacts with DNA 330 
directly and a bacterial two-hybrid assay indicated that SwrA interacted with the N-terminal 331 
domain of DegU far from the DNA binding surface (19).  The site  of DegU-SwrA interaction is 332 
supported by AlphaFold-Multimer and SwrA residues essential for activity are located at the 333 
interface (Fig 8B ) (16).  Moreover, the AlphaFold model predicts that SwrA bindi ng induces 334 
freedom of rotation in the DegU N-terminal dimerization domain,  which could provide a 335 
mechanism for lateral oligomerization.  SwrA-induced oligomerization might also explain the 336 
diffuse appearance of some EMSA supershifted bands and why high concentrations of both 337 
proteins appeared to cause clogging of polyacrylamide wells.  DegU oligomerization might also 338 
permit interaction with otherwise weak binding sites and explai n why an inverted-repeat 339 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 consensus binding site was difficult to detect.  Finally, we no te the enigmatic DegUhy32 allele 340 
selected in the absence of SwrA sits at the DegU dimerization interface and might induce 341 
mobility of the DegU N-terminal domain and partially mimic the SwrA-bound state (Fig 8B ) 342 
(21,22,33,35,42,43).   343 
 Why some promoters require UP elements and some do not is unkn own.  Here, the 344 
Pflache promoter requires an UP element for basal expression but is als o activated by 345 
DegU/SwrA to further increase flagellar gene expression.  We po sit that a complex transcription 346 
factor is needed to accommodate spatial juxtaposition of two in compatible cis-element 347 
sequences.  While SwrA/DegU may be unique, we note similarities  to a number of other poorly- 348 
understood activators.  For example, RcsA is a small helix-turn -helix protein that modulates the 349 
expression of a subset of promoters governed by RcsB to activat e polysaccharide biosynthesis 350 
(78-80).  In addition, Sxy/TfoX is a small protein that modulat es a subset of promoters controlled 351 
by CAP to activate DNA uptake machinery (81-83).  The FlhDC mas ter flagellar regulator of E. 352 
coli/S.enterica  is also bipartite, and while the literature disagrees on which protein(s) binds DNA, 353 
productive flagellar gene transcription only occurs in the presence of both (7,84-88).  Finally, 354 
SwrA, RcsA, Sxy, and FlhC all regulate either long operons or t ransmembrane nanomachines 355 
and each is proteolytically regulated by the Lon protease (17,8 9-92).   Perhaps complex 356 
enzymes or machines encoded in long operons require UP elements  and consequentially 357 
evolved heteromeric transcription factors to activate gene expr ession in response to 358 
environmental input.   359 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted August 4, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.04.552067doi: bioRxiv preprint 17 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 360 
          Strain and growth conditions: B. subtilis and E. coli strains were grown in lysogeny 361 
broth (LB) (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl per lite r) broth or on LB plates fortified with 362 
1.5 % Bacto agar at 37°C. When appropriate, antibiotics were added at the following 363 
concentrations: ampicillin 100 μg /ml (amp), kanamycin 5 μg/ml ( kan), chloramphenicol 5 μg/ml 364 
(cm), spectinomycin 100μg/ml (spec), tetracycline 10 μg/ml (tet ), and erythromycin 1μg/ml plus 365 
lincomycin 25μg/ml (mls). Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG, Sigma) was added to LB 366 
medium at 1mM concentration when required.  367 
          Strain construction: All PCR products were amplified from B. subtilis  chromosomal 368 
DNA, from the indicated strains. Constructs were transformed into the naturally competent strain 369 
DK1042 (3610 comIQ12L) (93) and transduced using SPP1-m ediated generalized transduct ion to 370 
other genetic backgrounds (94).   371 
          SPP1 phage transduction:  To 0.2 ml of dense culture (OD600- 0.6-1.0), grown in TY broth 372 
(Atoclaved LB broth supplemented with 10 mM MgSO 4 and 100 µM MnSO 4), serial dilutions of 373 
SPP1 phage stock were added and statically incubated for 15 min  at 37 °C. To each mixture, 3 374 
ml TYSA (molten TY supplemented with 0.5% agar) was added, pour ed atop fresh TY plates, 375 
and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Top agar from the plate conta ining near confluent plaques 376 
was harvested by scraping into a 15 mL conical tube, vortexed, and centrifuged at 5,000 X g for 377

Recipient cells were grown to OD600- 0.6-1.0 in 3 ml TY broth a t 37 °C. One ml cells were 379 
mixed with 25 µl of SPP1 donor phage stock. Nine mL of TY broth  was added to the mixture and 380 
allowed to stand at 37 °C for 30 min. The transduction mixture was then centrifuged at 5,000 X 381 
g for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in the remaining 382 
volume. 100 µL of cell suspension was plated on TY fortified wi th 1.5% agar, the appropriate 383 
antibiotic, and 10 mM sodium citrate and incubated at 37 °C ove rnight. All strains used in this 384 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 pAM56, pAM67, pAM68 and pAM69 respectively. The plasmids were p assaged individually 411 
through recA+  E. coli strain TG1, transformed into DK1042 and plated at restrictive temperature 412 
for plasmid replication (37°C) on LB agar supplemented with mls to select for transformants with 413 
single crossover plasmid integration. Plasmid eviction was ensured by growing the strains for 14 414 
hours at a permissive temperature for plasmid replication (22°C ) in the absence of mls 415 
selection. Cells were serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates in the absence of mls. 416 
Individual colonies were replica patched on LB agar plates with  and without mls to identify mls 417 
sensitive colonies that have successfully evicted the plasmid. Chromosomal DNA was isolated 418 
form the colonies that had excised the plasmid and allelic repl acement was confirmed by PCR 419 
amplification of the Pflache region using primers 1921 and 3042 followed by sequencing usin g the 420 
same set of primers individually.  421 
          Swarm expansion assay: Cells were grown to mid-log phase (OD 600 0.3-1.0) at 37°C in 422 
lysogeny broth (LB) and resuspended to and OD600 of 10 in pH 8.0 PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM 423 
KCl, 10 mM Na 2HPO 4, and 2 mM KH 2PO4) containing 0.5% India ink (Higgins). Freshly 424 
prepared LB plates fortified with 0.7% bacto agar (25 mL per pl ate) was dried for 10 min in a 425 
laminar flow hood, centrally inoculated with 10 μL of the cell suspension, dried for another 10 426 
min, and incubated at 37 °C. The India ink demarks the origin of the colony and the swarm 427 
radius was measured relative to the origin every 30 min. For co nsistency, an axis was drawn on 428 
the back of the plate and swarm radii measurements were taken a long this transect. IPTG was 429 
added to the medium at final concentration of 1mM to the LB broth and plates when appropriate.  430 
          β-galactosidase assay: B. subtilis  strains were grown in LB broth at 37°C with constant 431 
rotation to OD (0.7-1.0). One ml of cells were harvested and assayed for β-galactosidase 432 
activity. The OD 600 of each sample was measured and the cells were centrifuged and  433 
resuspended in 1 ml of Z-buffer (40 mM NaH 2PO 4, 60 mM Na 2HPO 4, 1 mM MgSO 4, 10 mM KCl 434 
and 38 mM β-mercaptoethanol). To each sample, lysozyme was adde d to a final concentration 435 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

500 μl of Z-buffer and the reaction was started with 100 µl of start buffer (4 mg/ml 2-nitrophenyl 437 
β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) in Z-buffer) and stopped with 250 µl 1 M Na 2CO 3. The OD 420 of 438 
the reaction mixtures were recorded and the β-galactosidase specific activity was calculated 439 
according to the equation: (OD 420/time x OD 600)] x dilution factor x 1000. IPTG was added to the 440 
medium at final concentration of 1mM to the LB broth and plates  when appropriate. Average β- 441 
galactosidase activities and standard deviations in Figure 2 are presented in Table S5 .  442

 Coomassie stained. Peak elutions were pooled, dialyzed into 1 X  PBS, 50% glycerol, and BSA 509 
was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml prior to storage at -20 ºC. 510 
          Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-Seq): Bacillus subtilis  cultures 511 
were grown to an OD 600 of 1.0 at 37°C with constant rotation. 20 ml of cells were cro ss-linked for 512 
30 minutes at room temperature using 3% formaldehyde (Sigma), q uenched with 125 mM 513 
glycine, washed with PBS, and then lysed. DNA was sheared to an  average fragment size of 514 
~200 bp using Qsonica sonicator (Q8000R), and then incubated ov ernight at 4ºC with α-SwrA 515 
or  α-DegU as indicated. Immunoprecipitation was performed using Protein A Magnetic 516 
Sepharose beads (Cytiva #45002511), washed, and DNA was eluted in TES (50mM Tris pH8, 517 
10mM EDTA and 1% SDS). Crosslinks were reversed overnight at 65ºC. DNA samples were 518 
treated with a final concentration of 0.2mg/ml RNaseA (Promega #A7973) and 0.2mg/ml 519 
Proteinase K (NEB #P8107S) respectively, and subsequently extra cted using 520 
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl (25:24:1). DNA samples were then used for library preparation using 521 
NEBNext UltraII DNA library prep kit (NEB #E7645L). Paired end sequencing of the libraries 522 
was performed using Illumina NextSeq 550 platform and atleast 3  million paired end reads were 523 
obtained for each sample.  Two or three biological replicates were sequenced for each sample.  524 
          Whole genome sequencing (WGS): Bacillus subtilis  cultures were grown to an OD 600 of 525 
1.0 at 37°C with constant rotation and 5ml of cells were collected, pelleted and DNA was 526 
extracted using Qiagen DNeasy kit (#69504). Genomic DNA was son icated using Qsonica 527 
sonicator (Q8000R) and the sonicated DNA was used to prepare libraries using the NEBNext 528 
UltraII DNA library prep kit (NEB #E7645L). Paired end sequenci ng of the libraries was 529 
performed using Illumina NextSeq 550 platform and at least 3 mi llion paired end reads were 530 
obtained for each sample.  Data from WGS was used as input for the ChIP. 531 
          Analysis of ChIP-Seq and WGS data: Sequencing reads for both  ChIP and WGS were 532 
mapped individually to B. subtilis 3610 genome (CP020102) (98) using CLC Genomics 533 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 Workbench software (Qiagen). The enrichment at ribosomal RNA locations were eliminated and 534 
the number of reads mapped to each base pair in the genome was exported into a .csv file. 535 
Data was normalized to the total number of reads and fold enric hment was calculated as the 536 
ratio of number of reads at each genome location in ChIP-Seq an d WGS (ChIP/input). Analysis 537 
was performed and graphs were plotted in 1kb bins to show enrichment across the entire 538 
genome using custom R-scripts. When required, individual peaks were plotted in 10bp bins 539 
across a 4kb range centered around the peak summit. Detailed pr otocols and scripts are 540 
available upon request. 541 
          MEME analysis: 200bp sequence surrounding the DegU peak center in WT, degQ+++ and 542 
degU degUhy32+++ (Table S1, S2 and S3) was extracted using a custom perl script and a fasta 543 
file was created. Sequences were subjected to Multiple Em for M otif Elicitation (MEME) v 5.5.2 544 
using parameters (meme sequences.fa -dna -oc . -nostatus -time 14400 -mod anr -nmotifs 3 - 545 
minw 6 -maxw 30 -objfun classic -revcomp -markov_order 0) (54) (Table S2 ). 30bp highly 546 
enriched motif sequences were extracted and sequence logo presented Fig S4  was created by 547 
WebLogo using default parameters (99).   548 
          Electromobility shift assay : DNA probes of 150-200bp regions surrounding DegU ChIP- 549 
Seq peak centers were generated by PCR amplification using DK10 42 chromosomal DNA and 550 
the following primer pairs: Pflache (7231/1782), P yxjJ (7463/7464), P flgM (7459/7460), PmcpA 551 
(7554/7555), PswrA (7461/7462), P yneI (7465/7466) and P comK (7229/7230). When required the 552 
Pflache (site1+2)  region was amplified using primer pirs (7231, 1782) using DB49  chromosomal 553 
DNA as the template. 25nM of DNA was radiolabeled using T4-Polynucleotide kinase (NEB 554 
M0201S) and 0.5μl of ATP(γ-32P) (Perkin, 3000Ci/mmol) in 20μl reactions. Excess unincorporat ed 555 
ATP(γ-32P) was removed by passing the reaction through as G-50 Micro Co lumns (Cytiva) and 556 
the radiolabeled DNA was stored at 4°C until further use. When appropriate, DegU 557 
phosphorylation reactions were performed by adding DegU-His 6 and DegS-His 6 at a ratio of 1:5 558 
and 1mM cold ATP to kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1  mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl 2, 1 559 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 mM DTT, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol) and the reactio n was incubated at room 560 
temperature for 20 minutes. 20 μl binding reactions were prepared with various concentrations 561 
of DegU, DegU-P and SwrA as indicated, 1ul of radiolabeled probe and 5ng/ul polydI-dC 562 
(Roche) in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM EDTA , 10 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM DTT, 563 
50 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol, 0.1mM ATP) and incubate d at 30°C for 30 minutes. 564 
6.5% native polyacrylamide gel was prepared using 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide (Biorad), 1X 565 
Tris-Glycine-EDTA buffer (25mM Tris base, 250mM Glycine and 1mM  EDTA pH 8.0) and 5% 566 
glycerol. Glycerol was added to the binding reaction at a final  concentration of 10% to facilitate 567 
loading and 12ul of the reaction mixture was fractionated on a 6.5% native gel in 1X TGE 568 
running buffer at room temperature for 1 hour at 100V (constant ). Gels were dried, exposed to a 569 
phosphorimager screen overnight and radioactive signal was dete cted using Typhoon FLA 570 
9500. Fiji v 2.1.0 (100) was used to quantify the fraction of unbound DNA the fraction of bound 571 
DNA was calculated by subtracting the fraction of unbound DNA f rom 1. DNA binding curves 572 
were generated in GraphPad Prism 9 using Non-linear regression and one site specific binding 573 
parameters.  574 
          DnaseI-footprinting assay:  300-350bp fluorescently labelled DNA probes surrounding 575 
the DegU ChIP peak was generated by PCR amplification using a f orward primer with a 5′-FAM 576 
fluorescent tag (IDT) and a reverse primer with a 5′-HEX fluore scent tag (IDT). Pflache probe was 577 
generated using primer pair 7548/7549 and Pyxj probe was generated using primer pair 578 
7562/7563 and DK1042 chromosomal DNA as template. The optimal c oncentration of DnaseI 579 
(NEB #M0570) at which uniform cleavage was observed across the probe was assessed over a 580 
range of concentrations (1X – 1024X) prepared in the presence of 1X DNAseI buffer. DegU was 581 
phosphorylated as described earlier. 20ul binding reactions were set up in 1X binding buffer to 582 
which 5ng/μl polydIdC, 20nM DNA probe, 1X DnaseI buffer and either no protein or indicated 583 
amounts of DegU-P and SwrA were added and incubated at 30°C for  30 minutes. 5μl of 584 
optimized DNAseI dilution was added to the reaction and incubat ed at room temperature for 15 585 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 minutes. Reaction was quenched by addition of 25μl of 0.5M EDTA  pH 8.0.  DNA fragments 586 
were cleaned using Qaigen MinElute PCR purification kit (#28004 ). Fragment analysis was 587 
performed by Genewiz, Azenta Life Sciences using a 3730 DNA analyzer and fragment size 588 
was determined using a GeneScan 500LIZ DNA size standard. Data was analyzed using Peak 589 
Scanner software v1.0 and the peak height corresponding each fragment size was exported into 590 
a text file. The values were plotted using a custom R-script and DNaseI protection was 591 
determined by an absence of peaks across a range of consecutive fragment sizes.   592 
          Alignment of P flache region: All bacteria that contain both SwrA and DegU were identified 593 
by BLAST+ v 2.12.0 (101). P flache  sequence ranging from +1 to -120 ( Fig 5 ) and -121 to -250 594 
(Fig S6 ) were extracted and aligned by Clustal Omega v 1.2.4 using default parameters (102). 595 
Alignment was shaded using Jalview v 2.11.2.7(103) using a 60% identity threshold and false 596
