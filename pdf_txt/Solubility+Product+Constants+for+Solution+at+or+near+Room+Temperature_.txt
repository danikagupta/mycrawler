 Chapter 1 – Introd uction  1.0 
Illinois is fortunate to have a wealth of water resources.  The state has almost 12 0,000 miles of rivers 
and streams, 91,400 inland lakes; of which 3,256 are six acres or larger1, 1,726,771 acres of shallow 
water wetlands2, 63 miles of Lake Mich igan shoreline, and jurisdiction over approximately 1,526 square 
miles of open water in Lake Michigan3.  Illinois is also situated above billions of gallons of groundwater, 
located within coarse -grained material aquifers, sand and gravel aquifers and bedro ck aquifers.  The 
citizens of Illinois depend upon these water resources every day to meet their basic needs when at 
home, work and play.  So it is vital that these resources are safe and clean.  
 It is estimated that 57.5 percent of Illinois’ monitored str eams and 98.7  percent of monitored lakes are 
impaired and that the majority of those impaired resources are negatively impacted by nonpoint source (NPS) pollution
4. 
 The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) amendments of 1987 laid a strong foundation for the impl ementation of NPS pollution control nationwide.  Illinois’ Nonpoint Source Management Program  
(Program) is the document  Illinois follows to coordinate and implement NPS pollution control efforts to 
protect our water resources.  
Definition of Nonpoint Source  Pollution  1.1 
NPS pollution is not defined in the Clean Water Act.  A brief 
definition is that NPS pollution includes pollution caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground and carrying natural and human -made pollutants into lakes, r ivers, 
streams, wetlands, estuaries, other coastal waters and ground water.  Atmospheric deposition and hydrologic modification are also sources of NPS pollution.
5 
 Illinois EPA also includes unnatural changes to the shape, flow, or biology of streams and other aquatic systems  as a source of 
NPS pollution . 
 Agricultural runoff, construction site runoff, urban runoff, hydrologic modifications, and resource extra ction activities are 
the major sources of NPS pollution that impair Illinois’ surface water and groundwater resources.  
 
The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) has formally recognized NPS pollution control efforts as a part of its strategy to protect Illinois’ environment since late 1980.  The 1987 amendment to the federal CWA broug ht NPS pollution to the forefront of environmental issues nationwide and 
acknowledged that control of point source pollution alone was not enough for the nation’s waters to achieve water quality standards.  NPS pollution had to be controlled as well.  Toward that end, Section 319(h) of the amended federal CWA established a framework and provided financial assistance to support state and local efforts to control NPS pollution.

Point Source Pollut ion 
Section 502 (14) of the Clean Water 
Act defines point source as: any 
discernible, confined and discrete 
conveyance, including but not limited 
to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, 
conduit, well, discrete fissure, 
container, rolling stock, concentrated a
nimal feeding operation, or vessel or 
other floating craft, from which 
pollutants are or may be discharged.  
This term does not include agricultural 
storm water discharges and return 
flows from irrigated agriculture.

 Mission Statements  1.2 
NPS pollution control is vital to achieving the m ission of the Illinois EPA and the missions of the Bureau 
of Water and NPS Unit.  These missions are as follows:  
 
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency  1.21 – The mission is to safeguard environmental quality, 
consistent with the social and economic nee ds of the state, so as to protect health, welfare, property, 
and the quality of life.  
 
Bureau of Water  1.22 – The mission of the Illinois EPA’s Bureau of Water is to:  
1. ensure that Illinois’ rivers, streams and lakes will support all uses for which they are designated 
including protection of aquatic life, recreation and drinking water supplies, and;  
2. ensure that every Illinois Public Water System will provide water that is consistently safe to drink; and  
3. protect Illinois’ groundwater resource for designated drinking water and other beneficial uses.  
 
Nonpoint Source Unit  1.23 – The mission of Illinois EPA’ Nonpoint Source Unit (NPS Unit) is to achieve 
and maintain the beneficial uses of Illinois’ surface and groundwater resources through:  
1. the abatement and prevention of known and presumed water quality impairments ensuing from NPS pollution and  
2. the ongoing analysis of the degree to which Illinois’ water resources support their beneficial uses and of the nature and extent to which those beneficial uses are impaired or threatened by the effects of NPS pollution.  
 
Illinois’ Nonpoint Source Management Program  1.24 – The mission of Illinois’ Nonpoint Source 
Management Program is to:  
1. establish and implement effective, integrated, and holistic actions for the abatement a nd 
prevention of known and presumed water quality impairments ensuing from NPS pollution;  
2. foster multi -agency cooperation and local stakeholder input on the development, maintenance, 
implementation, and evaluation of this statewide plan of action  
3. safeguard  water quality from NPS pollution, consistent with the social and economic needs of 
the state, so as to protect health, welfare, property, and the quality of life; and  
4. satisfy the informational and procedural requirements of a state NPS management program as stipulated under Section 319 of the CWA and associated federal guidance, including the nine key program elements of a successful state program as defined by a state/ U.S. EPA workgroup . 
 
Figure 1 - Point Sources versus NPS Sources - Indiana County Conservation District  3 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Long -term Goals  1.3 
The Program mission cannot be achieved unless l ong-term goals and objectives combined with short - 
and medium -term milestones are applied to guide its implementation over time.  The short - and 
medium -term objectives and milestones are listed in Chapter 7 and are referenced throughout the 
Program.  
 
The l ong-term  (more than 10  years) goals of the Program are:  
1. The restoration and protection of all beneficial uses of Illinois’ surface and groundwater 
resources from impairment by NPS pollution.  This goal will  be achieved through watershed -
based assessment, p lanning, implementation, and education activities carried out as part of an 
effective and efficient process that employs both regulatory and non -regulatory programs, 
agencies, authorities, and stakeholders.  
2. The prioritization and targeting of impaired wate rbodies for the selection and implementations 
of NPS pollution control measures so as to efficiently and expeditiously restore and protect the full support of their designated uses.  
3. Effective communication, coordination, collaboration, and education among all partners and stakeholders involved in NPS pollution control.  
4. The refinement and development of monitoring and assessment tools to better determine NPS pollution impairments, including nutrient impacts on Illinois waters.  
 
Illinois Environmental Protect ion Agency – Legal Authority 1.4  
The I
LLINOIS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT (Act) [415 ILCS 5/1 et seq  (2010)] designates Illinois EPA as 
the “water pollution control agency” for Illinois for all purposes of the CWA, which includes the 
development and implementation of state management programs to control pollution from nonpoint sources. The following describes pertinent sections of the Act:  
• Section 4(a) establishes in the Executive Branch of the State Government an agency to be known 
as the Illinois Enviro nmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA). [415 ILCS 5/4(a)(2010)]  
• Section 4(j) requires the Illinois EPA to represent the State of Illinois in any and all matters 
pertaining to plans, procedures, or negotiations for interstate compacts or other governmenta l 
arrangements relating to environmental protection. [415 ILCS 5/4(j)(2010)]  
• Section 4(k) authorizes Illinois EPA to , “...accept, receive, and administer on behalf of the St ate 
any grants, gifts, loans, indirect cost reimbursements, or other funds made ava ilable to the State 
from any source for purposes of the Act or for air or water pollution control, public  water 
supply, solid waste disposal, noise abatement, or other environmental protection activities, surveys, or programs.”  This same provision gives I llinois EPA authority to promulgate 
regulations and enter into contracts as necessary to carrying out these functions.  [415 ILCS 5/4(k)(2010) ] 
• Section 4(l) designates Illinois EPA as the “water pollution control agency” for the state for all 
purposes  of the CWA.  In addition, it authorizes Illinois EPA to take necessary action to secure 
for Illinois the benefits of the CWA and other federal acts. [415 ILCS 5/4(l)(2010)]  
• Section 4(m) authorizes Illinois EPA to engage in planning processes and activities and  to 
develop plans in cooperation with units of local government, state agencies and officers, and other appropriate person in connection with the jurisdiction or duties of each such unit, agency, officer, or person.  [415 ILCS 5/4(m)(2010)]   4 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 The Illinois E PA’s Nonpoint Source Management Program was initially approved by U.S. EPA on January 
3, 1990.  The Agency’s program was approved for upg raded status on July 22, 1999 and for Enhanced 
Benefit Status on October 6, 2000.  None of the relevant provisions of t he Environmental Protection Act 
highlighted above have been amended since the program was last approved by U.S. EPA.   In addition, no 
substantial changes have been made to the Illinois Nonpoint Source Management Program that would 
require a recertification  of legal authority for the program.   
  
  
Illinois EPA’s Nonpoint Source Management Program (Program) is the road 
map Illinois follows to prevent and abate NPS pollution impairments of Illinois’ surface and groundwater resourc es.  In order for Illinois EPA and 
its partners to attain the mission and goals identified above, a 
comprehensive yet practical Program must be developed and 
implemented.  The Program must be updated on a regular basis to address changes in state and feder

 Chapter 2 – State of Diversity – Water Resources, Watersheds, Land Use 
and Sources of NPS Pollution in Illinois  2.0 
The state of Illinois encompasses 55,519 square miles of land  and is home to 12, 875, 255 citizens .  The 
area of Illinois that is covered by water  is approximately 2,325 square miles; which is about 4 percent of 
the state6. 
 
The state is nearly 400 miles in length from its northern border to the southern tip.  This distance supports a widely varying cl imate.  Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over 46 
inches at the southern tip to around 34 inches in the northern portion of the state.  Normal annual snowfall exceeds 38 inches in the Chicagoland area, while the southern portion of  the state normally 
receives less than 14 inches.  Illinois averages around 51 days of thunderstorm activity a year, which ranks somewhat above average in the number of thunderstorm days for the United States.  
 Just under a quarter of the population of Illinois lives in Chicago, though over 65 percent of the population lives in what is known as Chicagoland, the metropolitan expanse that includes cities as far away as Rockford.  Other major urban areas include ‘Metro -East’, the Illinois side of the Greater S t. Louis 
Metropolitan Area, as well as the central urban areas of Champaign -Urbana, Bloomington -Normal, and 
Peoria.  
 Illinois ’ population is 5
th largest in the United States.  Manufacturing in 
the Chicago area makes up a significant portion of the economy , with 
world -leading industries in metal fabrication, electronic and 
transportation equipment, chemical products and machinery, as well as home to one of the publishing capitals of the world.  Agriculture is also an important economic earner, with corn, so ybean, hogs , and 
cattle leading the way.  
 
With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great 
agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a broad  economic base.  Illinois is a major transportation hub.  The Port 
of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean; as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Il linois River.  
 Though Illinois lies entirely in the Interior Plains, it does have some minor variation in its elevation.  In extreme northwestern Illinois, the Driftless Area, a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupie s a small part of the state.  Charles 
Mound, located in this region, has the state’s highest elevation above sea level at 1,235 feet.  Illinois’ lowest elevation is 279 feet above sea level and is located near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers in Alexander County.  The lack of elevation difference does not 
equate to less NPS pollution as it is counteracted by areas of topography with exceedingly long slope lengths.

Our History…  
 
In the 1810s, settlers began 
arriving from Kentucky.  In 1818, 
Illinois achieved statehood.  The 
state’s population originally grew 
from south to north.  Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks 
of the Chicago River, one of the 
few natural harbors on sou thern 
Lake Michigan.  
 
Railroads and John Deere’s 
invention of the self -scouring steel 
plow turned Illinois’ rich prairie 
into some of the world’s most 
productive and valuable farmlands.  
By 1900, the growth of industrial 
jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in the central and southern 
areas attracted immigrants from 
Eastern and Southern Europe.   
 6 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 The combination of a diverse population, water resources, climate, 
topograph y, soils, and land use are a formula for NPS pollution 
requiring a wide variety of solutions.  The programs and projects that control NPS pollution in the central agricultural areas will not control NPS pollution in the Chicagoland area, while the practice s that can 
solve urban NPS pollution issues will not protect Illinois water resources from the vast agriculture and coal lands in the central and southern part s of the state.  Differences in education, economic 
status , and religion also play a role in what  programs and projects 
local communities and landowners are willing to adopt.  Almost 95 
percent of Illinois land is controlled by private ownership.  
 
Even the process of watershed -based planning through community 
action is distinct  in Illinois.  This is m ostly due to Illinois’s diversity of 
communities.  For instance , Chicago, along the shores of Lake 
Michigan, is the nation’s  third largest city.  In 2010, 22.1 percent of 
Illinois’  population lived in Chicago, 40.5  percent in Cook County and 
64.8 percent in the counties of the Chicago metropolitan area: Will, 
DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties, as well as Cook County.  The remaining population lives in the smaller cities and rural areas that dot the state’s plains.
7 
 A watershed planning effort in the Chicagoland area rarely emulates a planning effort in the more rural areas of the state.  Stakeholders in the urban watershed might own, or rent, ¾ acre of land while agricultural watershed s have stakeholders that average 250 – 4,000 
acres of land PLUS control of additional rental acreage.  The average population density in Illinois is 231.1 persons  per square mile
8 while 
the population density of Chicago is 11,842 per square mile.9 
 
 Agriculture production in the state is also diverse.  Certain areas of the state have large numbers of livestock farms, while other areas favor crop production.  The farms also have a diversity of crops, with varying levels of vegetative cover that determines the crops ability for water quality protection.  The amount of cropl and tile drainage and irrigation also varies 
significantly throughout the state.  Varying soil types also have an impact on the amount of agricultural fertilizers and pestici des needed for crop production.

No-Till Farming with Horses!  
 
 
Douglas County has the oldest old -
order Amish communities in Illinois.  
Over 300 Amish families’ farm there 
and most of t he farms include a dairy 
operation.  Farm operations are done 
with horses.  
 
The Douglas County SWCD developed 
a horse drawn No -Till drill and fore 
cart rental program so that the Amish 
could try out No -Till drilled oats, hay, 
rye, wheat, soybeans, or pasture land.  
 
In less than 3 years, over 60 
agricultural producers have used the 
drill on 600 acres, saving over 2,400 tons of soil! 
 
Illinois is dominated by massive urban 
and suburban expansion in the north, 
fertile prairies in the central part of 
the state , and more rugged landscapes 
of the southern tip.  
 
 The Mississippi River forms the 
western border with Iowa and 
Missouri, and the Ohio River forms the southern boundary with Kentucky.

Water Resources Are Four Percent of Our State  2.1 
Approximately four percent of Illinois is covered by water10.  This 
includes rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands , which are all 
considered waters of the state11 and are protected under the 
Clean Water Act .  This doesn’t sound like very much water and it 
seems like it would be relatively easy to protect from sources of 
NPS pollution.  However , if you stretch just the known  stream 
miles (large rivers to intermediary streams) in Illinois into a 
straight line; that line would circle the earth’s equator roughly 4.8 times!  And this doesn’t include the lakes, wetlands, nearshore area, or groundwater resources located in Illinois!  
Surface Water Resources  2.2 
Surface Water resources include streams, rivers, creeks, lakes, nearshore area, and wetlands.  
Stream s 2.21  
Throughout this document, streams and rivers are collectively referred to as ‘streams ’.  The 
total stream miles, including the state boundary rivers, listed for Illinois is 119,244
12.  Major 
rivers include the Big Muddy, Cache, Des Plaines, Embarras, Fox, Illinois, Kankakee, Kaskaskia, Little Wabash, Rock, Sangamon, and Vermilion Rivers.  Approximately 911 miles of 
great rivers form the state’s western 
(Mississippi River), eastern (in part, Wabash 
River), and southern (Ohio River) borders.  
 
Inland Lakes  2.22  
More than 91,400 inland lakes and 
ponds exist in Illinois.  About three -
fourths of Illinois’ inland lakes are man -
made, including dammed streams, side -
channel impoundments, strip- mine 
lakes, borrow pits, and other excavated lakes.  Natural lakes include glacial lakes, sinkhole ponds, and oxbow and backwater lakes.  Major inland lakes include: Carlyle, Rend, Shelbyville, Crab Orchard, Clinton, Decatur and 
Springfield.

Known  Stream Miles…  
 
The number  of stream miles, lake 
acres, and g allons of groundwater we 
use for the Program are a best 
professional estimate.  An exact 
number is not available.  However, 
the technology used (e.g., aerial 
photos and GIS mapping) to 
determine these measurements is 
improving and we get closer each year 
to an actual amount.  
 
With this in mind, the target for NPS 
pollution control for our streams and even our lakes is a moving target.  
 
Illinois EPA uses the U.S. Geological 
Survey’s National Hydrography 
Dataset (NHD) as the basis for 
mapping streams in the s tate.  For the 
2010 cycle, the base layer used for 
mapping streams was upgraded from 
medium to high resolution.  This 
resulted in a significant increase in the 
total stream miles considered in the 
Illinois Integrated Water Quality 
Report and Section 303(d)  List (from 
71,394 to 119,244 stream miles) due 
to the inclusion of many small first 
and second order streams.  8 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Because of the state’s geologic diversity, Illinois enjoys a great variety of lake typ es.  Northern Illinois is 
home to most of the state’s natural glacial lakes created thousands of years ago as glaciers advanced 
and receded.  When a meandering stream cut a new and straighter channel, bends in the streambed were sometimes isolated, creatin g the generally horseshoe -shaped oxbow lake.  Impoundments and 
reservoirs have been formed by obstructing the flow of a stream  with a dam.  They are often used for 
public water supplies in central and southern Illinois.  Many ponds and stormwater detention  basins 
have been created by excavation or by expansion of an existing lowland area.  
 Although there is no precise legal definition of a lake or pond in Illinois, over the years various agencies have used a general rule of thumb : lakes are non -free flowing  (18 days or less residence time) bodies of 
water 6 or more acres in size, while ponds are less than 6 acres.  Because of their small size, ponds can present special management challenges.  Nevertheless, since lakes and ponds share many characteristics, for simplicity, both will be referred to as ‘lakes’ in this Program.  It is estimated that there are 3,256 inland lakes which have a surface area of 6 acres or more.
13 
Lake Michigan  2.23 
Illinois is bordered by one of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan.  The state has jurisdiction over approximately 1,526 square miles of open water and 63  miles of Lake Michigan shoreline, bordering 
Cook and Lake Counties in the northeastern corner of the state.  Lake Michigan is the third largest of the Great Lakes and is the larg est fresh water located entirely within the boundaries of the United States.  
Nearshore  2.24  
An important area within Illinois’ portion of Lake Michigan is called the ‘nearshore’.  According to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Action , “The aquatic nearshore can be considered to begin at the 
shoreline and extend offshore to the depth at which the warm surface waters typically reach the bottom in early fall, generally 20m – 30m deep, and terrestrial nearshore areas range from narrow beaches to 
inland fe atures influenced by Great Lakes processes. ” 
 Nearshore areas are impacted by NPS pollution in the same manner as inland lakes and wetlands.  However, the impairments are not as easily detected because Lake Michigan is such a large body of 
water , and since  many people believe the old saying of “Dilution is the Solution to the Pollution”, these 
areas are not normally considered a high priority for protection  or restoration  by the general public.  The 
area of Illinois that is considered to be nearshore would be approximately 63  miles in length with 
varying widths depending upon the topography of the lake bottom.  
Wetlands  2.25 
There are approximately 1,726,771 acres of shallow water wetlands  in Illinois
 14.  Palustrine, riverin e, 
and lacustrine wetlands are found in Illinois along the margins of lakes and ponds, throughout river flood plains, and as isolated depressions.  
 
In general terms, a wetland may be described as an area that is part land and part water.  The legal 
definition of a wetland, however, is more technical.  The State of Illinois defines a wetland in the Interagency Wetland Policy Act of 1989 as, “ …land that has a predominance of hydric soils and that is 
inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of hydrophytic v egetation typically adapted 
for life in saturated soil conditions ”.  In this document, the term ‘surface water’ includes wetlands.

14 Updating the National Wetland Inventory for Illinois – Final Report 8/31/10, Ducks Unlimited  9 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 The term ‘wetland’ is all -inclusive.  It includes anything 
ranging from a small area of ground that is relatively 
spongy for only a portion of the year, to a large area that is covered year- round by shallow water.  As a 
result, there is not one all -encompassing wetland type.  
Swamps, marshes, bogs, fens, backwater lakes and sloughs, small streams, shallow ponds, lake and river shores, wet meadows and prairies, and bottomland hardwood areas are all considered wetlands.  Each one has its own unique set of attributes and resulting 
functions ; including wetlands that act as, or are built 
specifically, as a best management practice.  
 
By their very nature, however, wetlands are dynamic resources.  The characteristics of any wetland  are 
constantly in flux.  The biotic communities and physical qualities t hat classify a wetland are always 
changing.  For example, through succession an area previously classified as Lacustrine may fill up from 
the gradual accretion of sediment and deposition of decaying organic material.  After years of this activity, the phys ical changes to the ecosystem and the biotic community may cause the wetland to be 
more accurately classified as a Palustrine marsh.  There are also many other ways wetlands undergo changes, and these natural and artificially induced changes make the monitoring and management of wetlands very difficult.  
Groundwater Resources 2.3  
Groundwater is a vital resource in Illinois.  About 4. 2 million 
people rely on groundwater for their drinking water.  This is nearly 30 percent of the State’s population.  About 76  percent 
of the community systems in Illinois use groundwater.  A major consumer of groundwater is public water supplies and private wells, consuming over 4 0 percent  of the total 
groundwater used in Illinois each year.  An estimated 400,000 
private  groundw ater wells are used for potable water supplies 
throughout the State.
15 
 Illinois sits upon a large reserve of groundwater resources.  When quantifying groundwater, professionals discuss aquifers in terms of potential yield, depth, substrate materials and area encompassed.  The number of wells and the capacity of water drawn is also a normally reported statistic.    To assess the groundwater resources of the state, the Illinois 
EPA utilizes three primary aquifer classes that were developed 
by O’Hearn and Schock
16.  These three principal aquifers are:  
• sand and gravel,  
• shallow bedrock, and  
• deep bedrock aquifers.

Wetland Facts…  
 
•Illinois once contained more than eight 
million acres of wetlands.   
•Illinois has lost as much as 90 percent of its 
original wet lands over the last 200 years.   
•Approximately 1,726,771 acres exist today.   
•Northeastern Illinois has the largest 
concentration  of wetlands in the state.   
•The largest acreage  of wetlands is in the 
bottom -land forests & swamps along Illinois’ 
major river s.   
 
Illinois Groundwater Numbers…  
 
•about 3.8 million  people use ground -
water as a source of public water 
supply (PWS).  
•there are 6,252 PWS, of which 4,864 
are groundwater dependent.  
•there are 1,746 community water 
supplies (CWS), of which 1,180 are  
grou ndwater dependent.  
•there are approximately 4,100 non-
community groundwater dependent 
systems that serve schools, parks, 
restaurants, and other businesses.  
•approximately 400,000 residences  are 
served by private wells.  
 10 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 
O’Hearn and Schock defined a principal aquifer as having a potential yield of 100,000 gallons per day per 
square mile and having an area of at least 50 square miles.  
 Approximately 58 percent (32,000 square miles) of the state is  underlain by principal aquifers.  Of these, 
about 33 percent (18,500 square miles) are major shallow groundwater sources .  Of the 3,420 active 
CWS wells that withdraw from these aquifers , 46 percent (1, 563) utilize sand -and gravel aquifer; 2 1 
percent ( 732) utilize a shallow bedrock aquifer; 24 percent (8 07) utilize a deep bedrock aquifer, 5 
percent (171) utilize a combination of two or more aquifers (mixed) and 4 percent ( 147) are 
undetermined.  
 
 
      
 Watersheds  2.4 
It has been stated that we all live in a watershed.  U.S. EPA 
defines a watershed as the area of land where all of the water that is under it or drains off of it goes into the same place.  
 Watersheds come in all  shapes and sizes.  They cross county, 
state, and national boundaries.  
 To provide a common identification approach  for drainage 
areas , the U.S. Geological Survey  established the original 8 -
digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC)
17.  In the late 1970s, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture  (USDA)  Natural Resources 
Conservation Service  (NRCS) initiated a national program to 
further subdivide HUCs into 11 -digit watersheds for use in 
water -resource planning.  These watersheds have since been  
sub-divided into successively  smaller hydrologic units.  The 
hydrologic units are arranged within each other, from the smallest (micro -watershed) to the largest (regions).  Each 
hydrologic unit is identified by a unique numeric hydrologic 
unit code consisting of two to fourteen digits  based on the 
levels of classification  in the hydrologic unit system.  
                                                             
17 U.S. Geological Survey, 1974  
Two Exceptions to the Rule…  
 
Certain areas of Illinois have natural 
(e.g., karst) or man -made (e.g., storm 
sewers) systems that do not allow 
watershed drainage to fully function.  
Surface water in  these areas might flow 
and outlet in one direction while the 
groundwater flows in another direction.    
 
The truncated drainage process does 
not allow nature to filter out the 
pollutants before the water is delivered 
to the stream or lake.  These systems 
also deliver water into the downstream 
drainage system faster than would 
normally occur – causing additional 
stress both during rainy and drought 
seasons.  
Figure 2 - Sand and Gravel, Shallow Bedrock and Deep Bedrock Aquifers  11 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Hydrologic Units  2.41  
Illinois is located within three regions, including the 
Great Lakes (04), Upper Mississippi (07), and the 
Ohio (05).   
 Illinois has 51 major river basins; these are also 
known as the 8 -digit hydrologic unit codes (HUC).  
Some of these basins include the border rivers – 
such as the Mississippi and the Ohio.  These 51 major river basins can be further dissected into 409 watersheds, also known as 10 -digit HUCs.  Or eve n 
farther down to 1,889  sub-sub-watersheds, also 
known as 12 -digit HUCs.  
 Planning at the watershed scale , and smaller,  is important when trying to protect and improve water 
quality through the control of NPS pollution.  According to U.S. EPA, the watershe d-based plan  (WBP) 
must address a large enough geographic area so that its  implementation will address al l of the sources 
and causes of impairments and threats to the waterbody in question.  These plans should include mixed ownership watersheds when approp riate to solve for the water quality problems.  While there is no 
rigorous definition or delineation for this concept, the general intent is to avoid single segments or other narrowly defined areas that do not provide an opportunity for addressing a waters hed’s stressors in a 
rational and economic manner.  At the same time, the scale should not be so large as to minimize the probability of successful implementation.
18  Illinois EPA recommends that watershed -based plan s be 
developed at the 12 -digit HUC level.

 Water Cycle 2.5 
The amount of NPS pollution that occurs depends upon the amount of precipitation, the  soils and  land 
use and the BMPs implemented to protect the land.  Northern Illinois will see roughly 34 inches of rain 
annually, while southern Illinois will see 48 inches of rain annually.  The duration and intensity of storms also impacts surface runoff rates.  
 
The extent of a storm and the distribution of rainfall during the s torm, are two major factors which 
affect the peak rate of runoff.  The storm distribution can be thought of as a measure of how the rate of 
rainfall (intensity) varies within a given time interval.  If a certain amount of precipitation was measured in a gi ven 24 -hour period, this precipitation may have occurred over the entire 24 -hour period or in just 
one hour.  The duration of the rain (and the peak intensity) directly affect the runoff rates.  
 The size of the storm is often described by the length of ti me over which precipitation occurs, the total 
amount of precipitation occurring and how often this same storm might be expected to occur (frequency).  Thus, a 10 -year 24 -hour storm can be thought of as a storm producing the amount of rain 
in 24 hours with a 10 percent chance of occurrence in any given year.

 Conditions of Illinois’ Water Resources  2.6 
The Illinois Integrated Water Quality Report and Section 303(d) List , developed by Illinois EPA’s Bureau 
of Water and published every two years, describes the conditions of Illinois’ surface water and 
groundwater resources.   Prior to circulation, Illinois EPA submits the document to U.S. EPA for review 
and approval.   As the 2014 Illinois Integrated Water Quality Report and Section 303(d) List  was only 
recently  drafted for public comment, fo r purposes of the Program, we will rely upon the Illinois 
Integrated Water Quality Report and Section 303 (d) List, 2012 ( 2012 IR ) for details regarding the 
quantity and quality of Illinois surface water and groundwater resour ces.  The 2012 IR  uses a 
combination of monitoring programs to identify surface water and groundwater resources that have been impaired by point and NPS pollution.  The 2012 IR  documents the potential sources and causes of 
impairment for specific waterbody  segments. 
 Resource quality conditions are assessed in terms of the degree to which waters attain ‘beneficial uses’, also called ‘designated uses’.  Pollution control programs are designed to protect individual designated uses, including aquatic life, indigenous aquatic life, primary contact (swimming), public and food processing , water supply (drinking water), secondary contact, aesthetic quality, and fish consumption.  
Each state has the responsibility to set water quality standards that protects these u ses.  In Illinois, the 
Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB) is the regulatory body responsible for establishing water quality standards.  
 The vast amount of water resources in Illinois does not allow every waterbody segment to be monitored.  For those w aterbody segments that are monitored, the degree of support (attainment) of a 
designated use is determined by an analysis of various types of information, including biological, physicochemical, physical habitat, and toxicity data.  When sufficient data are  available, each applicable 
designated use in each segment is assessed as Fully Supporting (good), Not Supporting (fair), or Not Supporting (poor).  Waters in which at least one applicable use is not fully supported are called 
‘impaired’.     14 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Streams  2.61  
For the 2012 IR , a total of 17,476 (14.7%) of the 119,244 stream  miles in Illinois were assessed for 
attainment of at least one designated use.

For the 2012 IR , a total of 1 96 of the 1,526 square miles ( 12.8%) of Lake Michigan open waters in Illinois’  
jurisdiction were assessed for the degree of aquatic life use support.  All 196 square miles are fully 
supporting aquatic life designated use.  
 
A total of 2. 58 (98.3%) of the 2. 6 square miles of Lake Michigan bays and harbors in Illinois’ jurisdiction 
were assessed for aquatic life use support.  Only 0.06 square miles are not supporting aquatic life  
designated use.  Contaminated sediments and urban runoff/storm sewers were identified as the sources 
of NPS pollution impacting Lake Michigan bays and harbors in Illinois.  Cadmium, chromium, copper, 
lead, phosphorus, and zinc were identified as the causes of Lake Michigan bays and harbor not attaining full support ratings.  
 Lake Michigan includes a total of 63 shoreline miles, forming the northeastern portion of Illinois’ border.  All 63 miles were rated as not supporting fish consumption and primary contact designated uses.   
Atmospheric deposition, source unknown, c ombined sewer overflows , and urban runoff/storm sewers 
represent the NPS  sources of pollution affecting the Lake Michigan shoreline in Illinois.  Escherichia coli, 
mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls were identified as the causes of Lake Michigan shoreline not attaining full support ratings.  
Wetlands 2.64 
For the 2012 IR, Illinois EPA partnered with Illinois Natural 
History Survey staff that work within the state of Illinois’ Critical Trends A ssessment Program (CTAP) to use their 
program as the basis for monitoring wetland resources throughout the state.  CTAP monitors the health of various wetland resources throughout  the state.  Because it is 
impractical to individually sample every wetland i n the 
state, a probabilistic monitoring design is used by CTAP to provide a reasonable determination of the health of the state’s wetland resources , while also being economically 
feasible, logistically practical, and statistically valid.  This program yiel ds comprehensive data and information that 
will be used to 1) establish a baseline of wetland resources and conditions from which to determine trends and changes in quantity and quality over time, 2) determin e 
reference conditions for the various classes o f Illinois 
wetlands, 3) develop and maintain a database which can provide for management and compensatory mitigation decisions, 4) provide information from which to evaluate wetlands restoration, creation, mitigation, and protection programs, 5) incorporat e wetland summary information into this, and future, 
Integrated Reports, and 6) provide necessary information required to develop applicable water quality standards.  
 Based on cursory data analysis, wetlands in Illinois were generally found to be well popu lated with 
native plant species, but high- quality wetlands have fewer non -native species (see figures 7 -10).  A  
much more reliable indicator of Ecological Integrity is illustrated with the conservation value of high -
quality wetlands, based on the Floristic Quality Index (FQI), which was much higher in reference than in randomly selected sites, and remained stable across sample periods.  A high number (29%, data not

Upon completion of the Wetland

 shown) of randomly selected sites were dominated by reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) , which is 
a non -native, invasive plant species that usually dominates a wetland to the exclusion of other plant 
species.  CTAP botanists also observed that many wetland sites were small in size and subject to 
disturbances such as artificial drainage, mowi ng, herbicide drift, or past attempts at cultivation and 
farming.   Cattle also actively grazed some sites.  An analysis of wetland size and adjacent land cover and 
use is ongoing.

Groundwater  2.65 
Groundwater contaminati on can result from a variety of accidental mishaps and/or the intentional 
disregard for the environment.  Examples include the improper use, storage, transport or disposal of chemicals; accidental chemical spills; and unintentional leaching of agricultural  chemicals.  
 To assess groundwater quality, the Illinois EPA operates an ambient network of community water supply (CWS) network wells consisting of 354 fixed locations.  For the 2012 IR: 
• 235 wells within this network were rated as Fully Supporting (‘good’ ),  
• 91 were rated as Not Supporting (‘fair’), and  
• 28 were rated as Not Supporting (‘poor’).   
 Results of 13 2 samples collected from October 200 8 through September 2010 from the Illinois 
Department of Agriculture’s dedicated pesticide monitoring network wells indicate that parent pesticides (the term pesticides includes herbicides) were detected in ten (7.9 %) of the 13 2 samples.  
Atrazine was detected in five  samples, metolachlor was detected in three samples , and acetochlor and  
simazine were each detected in one sample .    None of those samples had concentrations above levels 
of health concern.

Research on CWS wells in Northeastern Illinois has determined that road salting is the most threatening potential source causing and contributing to chloride contamination above background levels in that part of the state.  Approximately 16 percent of the samples collected from CWS wells in Northeastern 
Illinois during the 1990s had chloride concentrations greater than 100 mg/L.  However, prior to 1960 – 
before extensive road salting practices, the median values of groundwater samples collected from Northeastern Illinois were less than 10 mg/L .

 Karst Lands Impact Illino is’ Groundwater Resources22 2.65.1  
The term ‘karst’ refers to a landscape that typically is pockmarked with sinkholes, 
may be underlain by caves, and has many large springs that discharge into stream valleys.  Karst landscapes form when water from rain and snow melt seeps through a relatively thin soil cover and into fractured and soluble be drock 
(limestone or dolostone).  
 As water moves through the fractured rock, it slowly (over thousands to tens of thousands of years) dissolves and enlarges pathways along  the fractures and 
bedding planes of the rock.  
 Once these underground drainage pathways have been established in the bedrock, surface -water drainage is diverted underground.  As a result, karst areas 
generally lack the network of surface streams seen in most other areas.  In karst areas, surface runoff drains into sinkholes and flows through solution -enlarged 
conduits (‘caves’ if they are large enough for a human to crawl into) in the underlying rock until it is discharged through springs into surface stre ams at lower 
elevations.  
Karst Regions of Illinois  2.65.2  
Two conditions are necessary for karst landscapes (green areas on map): 1) soluble rocks, generally limestone and dolostone, must lie at or near the surface of the ground; 2) the loose soil covering  the 
soluble bedrock must be thinner than about 50 feet.  
 In the northern one -third of Illinois, the soluble bedrock strata in which karst features form are mostly 
dolostone made of the mineral dolomite (calcium -magnesium carbonate).  In this area, the karst 
landforms tend to be comparatively small – sinkholes are generally round and measure a few tens of 
feet in diameter.  Roadcuts along major highways expose solution -enlarged crevices in the rocks, many 
of which are completely or partially filled with soil.  
 In the southern two -thirds of Illinois, the soluble bedrock strata are mostly limestone, made of the 
mineral calcite (calcium carbonate).  Because limestone is somewhat more soluble than dolostone, sinkholes and other karst landforms tend to be more nu merous and larger here.  
 Some sinkholes in St. Clair, Monroe, and Randolph Counties (southeast of St. Louis, Missouri) are more 
than half a mile in diameter.  Irregularly shaped compound sinkholes, generally formed by the growth 
and merger of several round  sinkholes, also are more common here than in northern Illinois.  
Contamination Susceptibility  2.65.3  
Groundwater in karst landscapes is susceptible to contamination because of the fractured and honeycombed bedrock and the absence of a thick soil cover.  Recharge to the groundwater does not benefit from the slow filtering that occurs when rain and snow melt seep through thick sequences of clay-rich glacial till or low - permeability bedrock.  In karst areas, recharge to the water table is rapid 
(often occurring within minutes or a few hours of a rainfall) and can carry with it contaminants from the surface that may include effluent from private septic systems, agricultural chemicals, animal and 
livestock wastes, motor oil, industrial waste, and garbage.  Conse quently, in karst landscapes the risk of 
groundwater contamination from residential, agricultural, or industrial development is very high.

 Priority Waters for Protection  2.7 
The Program’s long -term goals include not only the restoration of waterbodies impaired by NPS 
pollution, but also the protection of all beneficial uses of Illinois’ surface and groundwater resources 
from the impairment of NPS pollution.  All unimpaired waterbodies in the state have the potential to be impaired by NPS pollution unless actions are taken and maintained to protect them.  The Program includes two types of water resources that are a priority for protection activities.  They include 
waterbodies that are currently monitored and still support all beneficial uses bu t have shown a 
downward trend that may not allow continued use support.  The second type are waterbodies located 
within areas of the state undergoing significant land use  changes that have potential to significantly 
impact water quality, such as intense urbanization.  
Downward Trending Waterbodies  2.71  
Illino is EPA and its partners have monitored inland lake and stream segments for over 30 years.  The 
2012 IR  includes  a Trends Assessment (Assessment) for many of the streams and inland lakes that have 
been sufficiently monitored.  The Assessment was conducted to determine if the ecological health of the 
monitored inland lakes and stream segments had changed over time.  The 2012 IR  includes  a summary 
of the Assessment findings and the data and processes used to develop the Assessment. 
 
Those inland lakes and streams that are listed in the Assessment as showing a decrease in ecological health are Priority Waters for Protection for the Program and are a high priority for activities that prevent NPS pollution from occurring.  T he specific waterbody  segments are listed in Tables 5 and 6.

In addition to the specific waterbodies listed above, to further protect both unassessed and unimpaired 
water bodies  within quickly urban izing areas of the state these too are a Priority for Protection  based on 
the 2012 IR or most recent Integrated Report .    22 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Land Use  2.8 
Lakes and streams are a reflection of their watersheds.  
Action, and in -action, taken within the watershed, can 
either improve or degrade the local water quality.  Land 
use is a major factor influencing the amount and sources of NPS pollution generated within a watershed.  
 Land use in Illinois includes agriculture, urban, forestry, wetland, water, transportation, mining, and a wide variety of other activities.  Land use is linked to our home, work and play.  The Illinois Department of Agriculture estimates that 76,000 farms cover more than 28 million acres – nearly 80 percent of the state’s total 
land area. It is estimated that at least 90 percent of 
Illinois is in private ownership.
23 
 Many people live, work , and play without considering how their actions, regarding their property, may 
affect their local resources.  They may subconsciously consider their property as ‘islands ’ and that it 
doesn’t have any impact on other land  (offsite ).  At the same time, they expect  that their neighbor’s 
property will not damage their property or impede their lifestyle.  The water quality impairments documented in Illinois show that t his belief is incorrect.  And although the saying “good fences make 
good neighbors” – may solve some of the neighborhood problems, it will never solve the NPS pollution 
problem .  People need to accept  that their actions and the actions of their neighbors can combine and 
exacerbate natural processes and cause significant water quality problems in their watershed.  
 Many individual actions or activities would not cause a significant NPS pollution problem.  One house 
and driveway will increase stormwater runoff, but th e local landscape can lessen the problem before it 
impacts the stream.  However, a subdivision of 1 00 houses, all with driveways, sidewalks , turf grass , and 
road systems delivers an amount of stormwater that cannot be absorbed by the existing surroundings.   
On agricultural fields, sheet erosion from one field may not seem to deliver much sediment to the local 
lake or stream, but erosion from dozens of fields quickly leaves a depth of sediment that significantly impacts our water resources .  Individuals need  to accept that they are part of a larger community, the 
watershed community, and that they do not act alon e; their actions are being compounded by their 
neighbors.   
 Illinois is a diverse state and our land use trends reflect that diversity.  The current level of water quality impairments by NPS pollution reflects many of our land use decisions.  
 Illinois has three major geographical divisions.  Northern Illinois is dominated by the Chicago metropolitan area; the city of Chicago, its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding.  As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.  Chicago is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, a transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups with a 
population of 9.5 million  people.  The city of Rockford, the fourth largest metropolitan area, and the 
state’s third largest city, sits along Interstates 39 and 90 some 75  miles northwest of Chicago.  The Quad 
Cities region, located along the Mississippi River in northern Illinois, had a population of 382,630
24.

 Southward and westward, the second major division is Central Illinois, an area of mostly prairie.  Known 
as the He art of Illinois, it is characterized by small towns and mid -sized cities.  The western section (west 
of the Illinois River) was originally part of the Military Tract of 1812 and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state.  Agriculture, particularly corn and soybeans, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently.   This area of the state has the most tile drainage systems installed.  Cities include Peoria, the third largest metropolitan area in Illinois at 380,447
25; Springfield, 
the state capital; Quincy; Decatur; Bloomington -Normal; and Champaign- Urbana.  
 The third division is Southern Illinois, comprising the area south of U.S. Route 50, including Little Egypt, near the juncture of the Mississippi River and Ohio River.  Southern Illinois  is the site of the ancient city 
of Cahokia, as well as the site of the first state capital at Kaskaskia, which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.  This region can be distinguished from the other two by its warmer climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the Illinoian  State, unlike most of the rest of 
the state), as well as small -scale oil d eposits and coal mining.  The Illinois suburbs of St. Louis comprise 
the second most populous metropolitan area in Illinois with over 700,000 inhabitants, and are known collectively as the Metro -East.  The other significant concentration of population in S outhern Illinois is 
the Carbondale -Marion -Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on Carbondale and Marion, a 
two-county area that is home to 126,745
26 residents.  A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the 
extended Evansville, Indiana Me tro Area, locally referred to as the Tri -State with Indiana and Kentucky.  
Seven Illinois counties are in the area.  
 The diversity of Illinois’ citizens and its landscape  are mirrored in the sources of NPS pollution in Illinois .  
Waters of the state are mo nitored and assessed for their ability to meet specific designated uses.  For 
waters that are determined to be ‘impaired’, Illinois EPA attempts to identify the sources related to the impairment.  Sources of NPS pollution in Illinois include: agriculture, construction, hydrologic modification, resource extraction, and urban runoff.  The following pages provide additional detail by source.  Note – while some categories are easily definable as either NPS or point source, some sources 
have the potential to be both.

 According to the Illinois Department of Agriculture, Illinois is a leading producer of soybeans, corn and swine.  The state’s climate and varied soil typ es enable agricultural producers  to 
grow and raise many other agricultural commodities, including cattle, wheat, oats, sorghum, hay, sheep, poultry, fruits and vegetables.  Illinois also produces several specialty crops, such as 
buckwheat, horseradish, ost riches, fish and Christmas trees.  
 
Illinois has more than 76,000 farms and they cover more than 28 million acres – nearly 80 percent of the 
state’s total land area.
27  The large number of farms, coupled with the diversity of commodities 
produced, makes it d ifficult to describe a typical operation.  However, statistics provide some indication 
about what it means to farm in Illinois.   
 
• The average size of an Illinois farm including hobby farms is 368 acres.  
• Most farm acreage is devoted to crops, mainly corn an d soybeans . 
• Nearly 10 p ercent of Illinois  farms have swine.  
• Beef cows are found on about 23 percent of farms, while about 3 percent have dairy cows.  
• Some farms produce specialty crops and livestock, including alfalfa, canola, nursery products, 
emus and fis h. 
• Many farming operations also support recreational activities such as hunting and fishing.

 Much of Illinois is comprised of fertile flat loess (soil type), left behind by glaciers and wind millions of 
years ago.  About 89 percent of the state’s cropland is considered prime farmland, ranking the state third nationally in total prime farmland acreage .  The central three -fourths of the state are general ly 
used for growing crops, while hilly areas in the northwest and south provide pasture for livestock.  
 Although Illinois’ food and fiber industry employs nearly 1 million people, there are only 76,000 farm 
operators, down from 164,000 in 1959.  During the same  time period, the average farm size more than 
doubled as sophisticated technology made many aspects of  the industry less labor -intensive.  Illinois 
agricultural producer s are generally more than 50 years old.  About 39 percent  hold jobs  off the farm 
and consider farming their secondary occupation.  Family farms still dominate, though some of these 
have inc orporated.  
Water Quality Threats  2.81.1 
It is estimated that more than 75 percent  of Illinois land is used for agricultural production.   This amount 
may have recently increased as Illinois agricultural producers have experienced the economic downturn 
of th e nation, while also benefitting from the addition of multiple ethanol plants.  The need for more 
income in conjunction with more market available for their product has been an increase in edge -of-
field farming which does increase NPS pollution to the loca l water resources.   Agriculture is a leading 
source of water quality impacts to monitored streams and lakes and also a major contributor to groundwater contamination and wetlands degradation.  
 Agricultural activities that cause NPS pollution include farmin g highly erodible land and riparian zones; 
excessive cultivation or cultivating at the wrong time; impro per, excessive, or poorly timed application 
of pesticides and fertilizers; tile drainage; irrigation; and poorly located or managed animal feeding 
opera tions and overgrazing.   Pollutants that result from farming include sediment, nutrients, pathogens, 
pesticides, metals, and salts . 
Crop Production  2.81.2 
One of the most prevalent sources of agricultural water pollution is soil that is washed off fields.  Rain water and snow melt carry soil particles (sediment) and deposit them into nearby surface waters .  Too 
much sediment can cloud the water, reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches aquatic plants.  It can also clog the gills of fish or smother fish larvae.   Sedimentation can also reduce the water quality and 
quantity of drinking water supplies.  
 In addition, other pollutants like nutrients , pesticides, and heavy metals are often attached to the soil 
particles and wash into the waterbodies , causing alg al blooms and depleted oxygen, which is deadly to 
more aquatic life  and creates foul taste and odor in drinking water.  Agricultural producers can reduce 
erosion and sedimentation by applying management practices that control the volume and flow rate of rain water and snow melt runoff.  
Nutrients  2.81.3 
Besides sediment, nutrients are a major source of agricultural water pollution.   Agricultural producer s 
apply nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium in the form of chemical fertilizers, manure,  
and biosolids .  They may also grow legumes and leave crop residues to enhance future production.  
When these sources exceed plant needs, or are applied just before it rains  or on frozen or snow -covered 
ground, nutrients can wash into aquatic ecosystems.  There they can cause algae blooms, which can ruin swimming and boating opportunities, create foul taste and odor in drinking water, and kill fish by removing oxygen from the water.  High concentrations of nitrate in drinking water can cause methemoglobinem ia, a potentially fatal disease in infants, also known as blue baby syndrome.  To 26 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 combat nutrient losses, agricultural producers can develop and implement nutrient management plans 
that help maintain high yields and save money on fertilizers.  
Pesticides  2.81 .4 
Insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides are used to kill agricultural pests.  These chemicals can enter and contaminate water through direct application, runoff, and atmospheric deposition.  They can poison fish and wildlife, contaminate food sources, and destroy the habitat that animals use for protective cover.   
They can also impair drinking water supplies.   To reduce contamination from pesticides, agricultural 
producer s should use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques based on the specific so ils, climate, 
pest history, and crop conditions for a particular field.  IPM encourages natural barriers and limits pesticide use and manages necessary applications to minimize pesticide movement from the field.  
Irrigation  2.81.5 
Irrigation water is applie d to supplement natural precipitation or to protect crops against freezing or 
wilting.  Inefficient irrigation can cause water quality problems.  In times of drought, for example, where rainwater does not carry minerals deep into the soil, evaporation of irrigation water can concentrate salts.  Excessive irrigation can affect water quality by causing erosion, transporting nutrients, pesticides, and heavy metals, or decreasing the amount of water that flows naturally in streams and rivers.   All of 
these have  an impact on drinking water supplies.   It can also cause a buildup of selenium, a toxic metal 
that can harm waterfowl reproduction.  Agricultural producer s can reduce NPS pollution from irrigation 
by improving water use efficiency.  They can measure actual crop needs and apply only the amount of water required.  Agricultural producers may also choose to convert irrigation systems to higher efficiency equipment.  
Animal Feeding Operations  2.81.6 
By confining animals in small areas or lots, agricultural produ cers can efficiently feed and maintain 
livestock.  But these confined areas become major sources of animal waste.  Runoff from poorly managed facilities can carry pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, nutrients, and oxygen -demanding 
organics and solids t hat contaminate local water resources.  Groundwater can also be contaminated by 
waste seepage.   Both surface and groundwater drinking supplies can be impaired by runoff from animal 
feeding operations.   Agricultural producers can limit discharges by storing  and managing facility 
wastewater and runoff with appropriate waste management systems.  
Livestock Grazing  2.81.7 
Overgrazing exposes soils, increases erosion, encourages invasion by undesirable plants, destroys fish habitat, and may destroy streambanks and  floodplain vegetation necessary for habitat and water quality 
filtration.  All of these can have an impact on drinking water supplies.  To reduce the impacts of grazing on water quality, agricultural producers can adjust grazing intensity, keep livestock out of sensitive areas, provide alternative sources of water and shade, and promote revegetation of ranges, pastures, and riparian zones.  
Tile Drainage  2.81.8 
By tiling land, agricultural producers can expand the acreage of crop production and conduct fiel d work 
earlier in the spring.  Tiling land can cause the loss of wetlands and increase the loss of nitrate through the tile drains.  Drainage has both positive and negative effects on water quality.  In general, less surface runoff, erosion, and phosphorus  is lost from land that has good subsurface drainage than from land 
without drainage improvements or with only surface drainage.  
 Nitrate loss can be quite high from drained land.  Because nitrate is very soluble, it flows easily through the soil and into tile lines.  Nitrate flow from subsurface drains is one of the main sources of nitrate in 27 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 streams and rivers in the Midwest.   High concentrations of nitrate in drinking water can cause 
methemoglobinemia,  a potentially fatal disease in infants, also known as blue baby syndrome.   
Pesticides can also flow into subsurface drains, but usually only in very low concentrations.  Pesticides 
move more easily in flow over the soil surface than through the soil, so the highest concentrations of pesticides in tiles are often in fields that have surface inlets into the drains.  In fact, subsurface drainage may actually reduce pesticide loss to streams because it reduces surface runoff.
28 
 Lakes and streams  that have a large percentage of their watershed tiled  can experience extreme water  
level fluctuations.   After s torm s, water flows directly through the tile system rather than being absorbed 
by plants or soaking naturally into the soil and returning to the stream through the subsoil.  This type of 
hydromodification or chan ge in stream flow  will sustain  flooding, increase streambank and channel  
erosion , and  cause the  destruction of  fish habitat.  During droughts and in between storm events, the 
water level will be low;  this impacts  the water temperature  and the amount of wat er available for plants 
adjacent to the stream and to the fish and critters in the stream itself.  
 
Impacts from agricultural activities on surface water and groundwater can be minimized by using management practices that are adapted to local conditions.  M any practices designed to reduce 
pollution also increase productivity and save agricultural producer s money in the long run.  
 
Control impacts from agriculture land uses by:  
• Managing surface cover for erosion control  
• Managing rain water and snow melt to avo id concentrated flow  
• Managing nutrients effectively  through proper product selection, rate of application and 
timing  
• Managing livestock waste effectively  
• Reducing insecticide use  
• Reducing herbicide use  
• Using less-toxic pesticides  
• Retiring highly erodible land from production

  Construction activities do impair stream miles and lake acres in Illinois.  However, documenting sources contributing to specific waterbody segments is difficult due to the relatively

schedule . 
 Construction activity, as used in this report, refers to residential, commercial and industrial development, highways and roads, transmission systems, utilities, water resource projects, or other land disturbing activities, except for certain agricultural activities.  Specific construction activities include timber clearing, grubbing and topsoil removal, site grading and excavation; concrete, asphalt, and other facility operations; d emolition of old structures; 
foundation and building construction; waste  disposal; soil 
stabilization, fertilization, revegetation; pest control; and site restoration following construction.    
 
   
Water Quality Threats  2.82. 1 
The removal of vegetation fro m the land can allow erosion 
and sedimentation to occur.  The length of time that the soil 
is left without an established vegetative cover can greatly increase the potential for water quality damage due to erosion.  During construction, the introduction of  building 
materials presents a new potential problem.  If solid wastes, including vegetative materials, trash, spilled cement, bituminous mixtures, and chemicals are not properly contained and disposed of, they can impair water quality.

 Development has both direct and indirect impacts on waterbodies  and other valuable natural features.  
These impacts occur both during construction and after the development is complete.  Some impacts 
result from the direct modification or destruction of streams, lakes and wetlands.  Other impacts , 
primarily offsite , occur  due to changes in the quality and quantity of runoff from the development.   
Groundwater can also be impacted by precipitation infiltrating through the construction site.  
 Erosion and sedimentation are natu ral geologic processes that human activities often accelerate.  
Erosion occurs through the action of water or wind.  In Illinois, water is the primary cause of erosion.  Wind erosion in urban areas is a minor concern, but it can be a nuisance and even a sa fety hazard in 
areas near a site under development.  
 There are three major processes that must be understood to effectively control or limit soil erosion and sedimentation on construction sites.  These are detachment, transport and deposition.  The four ty pes 
of erosion are described as follows:  
• Raindrop erosion is erosion resulting from the direct impact of falling drops of rain on soil particles.  This impact dislodges soil particles and splashes them into the air.  The dislodged soil particles can then b e easily transported by the flow of surface runoff.  
• Sheet erosion is the removal of a layer of exposed surface soil by the action of raindrop splash 
and runoff.  The water moves in broad sheets over the land and is not confined in small 
depressions.  
• Rill a nd Gully erosion occur after runoff flows concentrate into rivulets, cutting several inches 
deep into the soil surface.  These grooves are called rills.  Gullies may develop from rills if not repaired or in other areas where a concentrated flow of water mo ves over the soil.  
• Stream and Channel erosion occurs with an increase in the volume and velocity of runoff.  These larger and faster flows detach and then transport soil from the stream bottom and the stream 
bank toe.  If not repaired, large sections of the stream bank may fail or slump into the stream.  
 
National estimates indicate that uncontrolled erosion from construction activities can generate enormous quantities of sediment – 20 to 200 tons per acre per year.  In comparison, typical erosion 
rates from  cropland range from 1 to 20 tons per acre per year.
29 
 Construction site erosion and the movement of sediment as it leaves the site can cause several offsite problems.  Also, a site that has been degraded from excessive erosion is more expensive to landsca pe 
and maintain.   The resultant sediment deposits are expensive to remove from culverts, ditches, lakes and stream.  
 Sediment from construction sites adversely affects water clarity, which reduces sunlight penetration thereby limiting photosynthesis by aquatic plants.  In addition, impaired water clarity negatively impacts fish searching for their prey.  Sediment -laden runoff also transfers nutrients and other pollutants to 
downstream lakes and rivers, degrad ing habitats and spawning areas of aquatic organ isms. 
 Sedimentation in developing areas may create damage on land, in water supplies, and in drainage systems.  The sedimentation in these areas can be costly in terms of the expense involved in correcting the damage.  Sediment fills drainage channels and  plugs culverts and storm drainage systems, thus 
necessitating frequent and costly maintenance.  Sediment accumulation also reduces the stormwater 
conveyance and storage functions of streams, detention basins, and floodplains, leading to increased 
potentia l for flooding.  Municipal and industrial water supply reservoirs lose storage capacity, navigable

 channels must continually be dredged, and the cost of filtering and disposing of muddy water in 
preparation for domestic or industrial use may create substan tial financial burdens.  
 Impacts from construction activities on surface water and groundwater can be minimized by using management practices that are adapted to local conditions.  Many practices designed to reduce pollution also save developers and landow ner’s  money in the long run.  
 
Control impacts from construction activities by:  
• Installing temporary vegetative cover for those disturbed areas that are not scheduled 
for construction within seven (7) days . 
• Managing surface cover for erosion control  
• Control ling the flow of water 
• Install, operate and maintain BMPs to ensure they remain effective  
• Developing and following a Storm Water Pollution Prevent Plan

In Illinois, many acres used for agricultural production and 
urban development experienced hyd rologic modification 
before being cultivated or build upon.  Streams and rivers were dammed to create lakes and reservoirs.  Other streams and larger ditches were dredged to provide 
outlets for the tributary watersheds.  Where soils were sufficiently permeable, tile drains  were 
constructed by  landowner s and drainage districts.  Ditches were dug in areas of low soil permeability.  
Levees were constructed in extensive areas, especially along major streams, to prevent overflows onto the flood plains.  Maintenance of existing drainage systems and extensions of others continue at this time.    
Water Quality Threats  2.83.1  
Hydrologic modification projects are conducted for the purpose of obtaining specific benefits, but they typically result in unintended negative environmental impacts affecting aquat ic wildlife, hydrology, and 
water quality.  The type and degree of environmental impact depends upon the original composition of the natural community, construction activity undertaken, construction methods used, and soil type (i.e., erosion potential).

 Many developing and expanding communities infringe on existing wetland and floodplain areas.  The 
reduction of infiltration in urban areas increases stormwater runoff.  Modified or channelized streams 
may no longer be able to protect the community from the impacts of flooding.  In addition, the modified channel, in most cases, will still deliver larger amounts of water downstream faster causing additional damage downstream.  
 Hydrologic modification may be defined as activities that  include the  alter ation of  the geometry and/or 
physical characteristics of a body of water such as a stream, river, wetland, or lake.  Modification activities include dredge and fill, wetland drainage, streambank and lakeshore alteration, dam construction, stream channelization, flow regulation, bridge construction, and removal of riparian or 
lakeside vegetation.  These hydrologic modifications tend to affect the biological, chemical, and physical 
properties of ground and surface waters and adjacent habitats.  
 The removal of streambank vegetation reduces available shade and encourages increased water temperature.  Higher water temperatures in modified channels can impair respiration, retard growth, lower disease resistance, and interrupt the spawning cycle for some fish.  Increased solar input may enhance the growth of algae and other aquatic plants thereby reducing the waters capacity to hold dissolved oxygen.  Removal of streamside vegetation also involves the removal of an important source of food and energy for aquatic communities.   The removal of in -stream debris may eliminate the 
protective cover used by fish for resting or spawning and for invertebrates that cannot withstand the higher current velocities in an open stream.  Construction activities in or near a stream and the remo val 
of streamside vegetation increases the potential for erosion and the introduction of large quantities of particulate matter to the stream.  
 Channelization increases the slope and velocity of the altered stream.  A channelized stream has its flow conce ntrated in a minimal area with a maximum velocity, 
which increases the unit stream power and enhances its capacity to erode streambanks and transport sediment.  The channelized stream no longer has a  release for this 
energy as is provided by stream meander s.  Therefore, 
the channel flow may erode streambanks and bottoms in an alternating manner in an attempt to re -establish a 
sinuous course.  
 
Channelization activities typically create straight channels of uniform depth, eliminating or reducing the natural pool  and riffle areas, and stream flow 
obstructions.  Pools and riffles serve as naturally effective means of reducing stream power and the erosive energy of a stream.  They also trap sediment, nutrients, and NPS pollutants during low and medium flow condi tions.  For 
the modified channel, as well as for the waters to which it discharges, this enhanced erosive capacity creates many water quality problems in terms of suspended sediment and downstream sedimentation.  
 The diversity of terrestrial and aquatic h abitat is diminished as a result of the 
elimination or reduction of pool and riffle areas and stream flow obstructions.  Channel modification that reduces habitat diversity by creating a basically uniform stream water depth, velocity, and bottom type may p revent 
previously present stream organisms from living in this modified channel.  
Figure 16 – Stream Cycle  
Source - Fairfax County, Virginia  
Figure 15 – Channelized Stream  
Source - Missouri Stream Team  33 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Channelization also reduces stream sinuosity and length thereby reducing the total quantity of aquatic 
habitat area.  The sediment deposition pattern of a channelized stream is altered to reflect the 
homogeneous flow characteristics of the channel.  This may result in a lower diversity of substrate conditions and habitat loss for some species.  
 The hydraulic connection between a stream and its adjacent floodplain and wetland area is reduced through channelization.  Adjacent floodplains and wetlands are inundated less frequently due to the increase d channel conveyance associated with a channelized stream.  While channelization may seem to 
effectively transport stormwater away from a given area, it increases the potential severity of downstream flooding.  By shortening the stream and reducing the friction associated with meanders, 
vegetation, and bottom diversity, channelization causes peak flows to move more rapidly downstream.  
Channel modification projects designed to reduce the frequency and duration of flooding may also lower the water table in the floodplain, which may eliminate wetlands and wildlife habitat.  Impacts from hydrologic modification activities on surface water and groundwater can be minimized by using management practices that are adapted to local conditions  and are designed to avoid potential 
adverse off-site impacts . 
 
Control impacts from hydrologic modification by:  
• Reducing the implementation and use of channelization and levee systems  
• Stabilize existing channel erosion  
• Stabilize existing bank erosion  
• Restore riparian buffers to an adequate width for the site  
• Apply stormwater detention/retention BMPs upstream of the site to manage 
stormwater flow to the creek  
• Manage riparian buffers to maintain healthy variety of plants to maintain stable 
environment

  Illinois possesses available reserves of coal, oil and gas, clays, fluorspar, sand and gravel, lead, zinc, and numerous other metals and minerals.  The State’s most abundant mineral resource is coal ; Illino is ranks third in the nation for having the 
largest recoverable coal reserves.  
 
About 68 percent of Illinois has coal -bearing strata of the 
Pennsylvanian geologic period.  According to the Illinois State 
Geological Survey, 211 billion tons of bituminous c oal are 
estimated to lie under the surface , having a total heating value 
greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula.  However, this coal has a high sulfur content, which causes acid rain unless special equipment is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.  Many Illinois power plants are not equipped to burn high -sulfur coal.  In 1999, Illinois produced 40.4 million tons of 
coal, but only 17 million tons (42%) of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois.  Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other state s, while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois 
(21 million tons in 1998) is mined in the Powder River Basin of 
Wyoming.

 Coal has been mined in 73 counties in Illinois.  More than 4,500 coal mines have operated since 
commercial mining began in Illinois about 1810; fewer than 50 are currently active.   By the late 1970s 
over 200,000 acres of land had been affected by surface and deep mining of coal in Illinois.  Of this disturbed acreage, over 22,000 acres were identifie d as being ‘problem’ acreage.  The acreage includes 
areas with exposed refuse material (gob and slurry), tipple sites, toxic or sparsely vegetated spoil banks and adversely affected water and land.  The acreage also includes left open or inadequately sealed mine shafts and slopes, mine gas leads, polluting refuse piles and spoil ridges as well as subsidence problems.
30 
 There is currently oil production in 40 counties in Illinois with most of the production located in the 
southern part of the state.  There a re currently 32,100 oil and gas production wells, 10,500 Class II 
injection wells and 1,750 gas storage wells in Illinois.  These wells are controlled by 1,500 operators.  
Approximately 800 drilling permits for oil, gas and injection wells are issued each year by  the IDNR.  The 
majority of wells in Illinois are ‘stripper wells’ with a daily production of 1.5 barrels per day.

Water Quality Threats  2.84.1  
Although all types of resource extraction have the potential to adversely affect air,  land, and water 
quality, surface mined coal production, by sheer volume, is the major potential resource extraction 
source related activity in Illinois.  Uncontrolled excavation and extraction of mine -related resources can 
produce severe environmental dam age. 
 Major environmental problems include the disruption, and often permanent, degradation of large areas of land and water.  Past mining operations have included the relocation and/or channelization of streams to locate them outside of the mining boundary area.  Another potential source of NPS pollution associated with coal resource extraction activities is acid mine drainage, which results from the chemical reaction of pyritic or sulfide compounds (commonly iron sulfides) and oxygen in the presence of wa ter.  
Precipitation falls upon erodible acidic spoil banks and discarded coal preparation wastes and ultimately

Emerging Issue: “Fracking”  
High volume hydraulic fracturing  
Using large amounts of water and sand or sand -like materials to vertically 
crack (fracture) bedrock to release oil and gas reservoirs has become an emerging issue in southern Illinois.  Currently oil and gas companies are buying mineral rights to reserve the right to “mine” areas of potential oil and gas reserves.  There is also legislation (SB1715) to regulate this activity through permits and monitoring.  The legislation is touted as the mos t 
stringent in the nation and is likely to become law.   The language was successfully crafted by industry, environmental advocates and agency (Illinois EPA and I DNR) staff.  State Senate has passed the legislation onto the House 
that may hear the legislat ion prior to the end of spring session, 2013.  Without 
such legislation high volume fracking is a permitted activity in Illinois as a 
“regular” mining activity.  
 36 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 forms concentrated sulfuric acid, which can enter adjacent ground and surface waters through seepage 
and overland flow, respectively.  
 In addition to coal mining, oil and gas extraction can also impact the Illinois landscape.  Oil brine damaged land from oil extraction deteriorates the ability of soils to produce vegetation, thereby increasing soil erosion and sedimentation potential to surface waters.  Accidents and poorly maintained extraction and transfer equipment increase the risk of both ground and surface water contamination.   
 Impacts from resource extraction activities on surface water and groundwater can be minimized by using management practices that are adapted to local conditions.  
 
Control impacts from resource extraction areas by:  
• Managing surface cover for erosion control  
• Tracking and controlling the flow of water 
• Installing BMPs to deal with pH

  Toxicants are identified as a source of NPS pollution delivered to Illinois’ surface and groundwate r resources .  It is important 
to note that this source has significant overlap with the other 
sources of NPS pollution listed in this chapter.  
Water Quality Threats  2.85.1  
Toxicants (e.g., arsenic, mercury, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) (or toxic substances) refer to any pollutant or combination of pollutants that cause impairment to aquatic or terrestrial life or cause an adverse impact to human health.  Many substances occur naturally in the environment without reaching toxic levels.  These sam e substances may become pollutants and reach toxic levels when 
human activities release excess quantities into the environment.  Toxicity is never acceptable when it has the potential to cause adverse impacts to a waterbody, aquatic or terrestrial life, or to human 
health.    Toxicants in surface waters, bottom sediments, and bioaccumulations in fish tissue pose a threat to human health, recreation potentials, and the economy of local communities.  Toxic substances must be recognized as a factor capable of degrading and therefore lessening the value of aquatic systems, along

 with habitat destruction, conventional pollutant loading 
(oxygen depletion), thermal pollution, water quantity problems, over utilization of species and the introduction of harmful, non -native species.  
 Water quality standards are set at levels that will prevent bioaccumulations in fish from reaching levels that are harmful to humans if consumed.  In addition to human health, direct toxicity to aquatic life is an important reason to cont rol 
toxicants since aquatic life is often more sensitive to toxicants 
than are humans.  Food chains need to be protected at all 
levels (producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers) if ecosystems are to be preserved.  Changes in the structure of aquat ic life communities can signal that toxics are present 
and may also warn that conditions may not be suitable for direct human use.  
 In the case of NPS pollution control to reduce the amount of pollutants reaching a waterbody, to be effective and improve water quality for long -term, it must also address the pollutants already contained 
by the waterbody and in the bottom sediments.  Sediments contaminated with nutrients or toxic 
pollutants can contribute substantially to the impairment of designated uses of s urface waters.  
Sediments tend to be a sink for both nutrients and toxic pollutants and can be a continuing source of contaminant to overlying and downstream waters even after point and NPS controls for these pollutants have been implemented.  Therefore, remediation of sediments is often necessary before waterbodies  
can fully attain their designated uses.  
 Impacts from toxicants on surface water and groundwater can be minimized by using management practices that are adapted to local conditions.  
 
People can help control impacts from toxicants by:  
• Proper use and application of fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides  
• Controlling the flow of water  
• Reducing insecticide use  
• Reducing herbicide use  
• Using less-toxic pesticides  
   
Aquatic life toxicity standards are 
established to protect the most 
sensitive species of aquatic life from a 
given toxic substance, whether that is 
a fish, a fish food organism, or algae.  
Typically, compliance to standards is 
accomplished by regulating the 
discharge of toxicants from point 
sources through NPDES permits and 
by banning or restricting the use of 
substances that may find their way 
into waterbodies via NPS avenues.  
Control of toxicants is difficult unless 
the primary sources are regulated 
point source discharges.  39 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013

Water Quality Threats  2.86.1  
As open space is converted into urban areas the loss of natural water storage due to increased impervious surface area can adversely affect downstream floodplains, streams, and lakes.    If not 
properly addressed during the planning stages of  an urban project, increased runoff will intensify 
flooding potential, cause downstream damage (i.e., channel erosion, streambank erosion, flooding), and increase NPS pollutant loading to receiving waters.  NPS pollutants that collect on urban surfaces, su ch 
as nutrients, solids or sediment, bacteria, salts, oil and grease, heavy metals, and organic and inorganic chemicals, are transported in stormwater runoff and ultimately discharged into receiving waters.   The 
most common causes  of water quality threats  being reported in the IR are nutrients, total suspended 
solids, chlorides, and dissolved oxygen; which in turn are the causes that are most often targeted for NPS pollution control in Illinois.    It is estimated that as little as 10 percent impervious cov er in a watershed can result in stream 
degradation.
34  Illinois EPA estimates that the six county northeastern Illinois region has an average 
value of approximately 18 percent  of impervious land use .  Cook County has the largest amount at 
almost 50 percent,  while Will County and McHenry County are closer to 5 percent each.

 Impacts from urban activities on surface water and groundwater can be minimized by usin g best 
management practices that are adapted to local conditions.  Many practices are designed to reduce 
pollution, increase aesthetics and provide other benefits such as flood prevention and wildlife habitat improvement.  
Citizens and communities  can help control impacts from urban land by:  
• Managing surface cover for erosion control  
• Harvesting  rain water  and snow melt for reuse  
• Retrofit existing developed areas with green infrastructure  
• Applying low impact development concepts  
• Zoning and ordinance  
• Managing nutrients effectively  
• Reducing insecticide and herbicide use  
• Using less-toxic pesticides  
 
Green Infrastructure  
 
Green infrastructure means any stormwater management technique or practice employed with the primary goal of preserving, restoring, or mimicking natural hydrology.  Green infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, methods of using soil and vegetation to promote soil per
colation, evapotranspiration, and filtration.  Green 
infrastructure includes the preservation and restoration of natural landscape features, such as forests, 
floodplains, headwaters, and wetlands.  Green infrastructure also includes rain gardens, permeable  pavements, 
green roofs, infiltration planters, trees and tree boxes, and rainwater harvesting for non -potable uses, such as 
toilet flushing and landscape irrigation.  (Public Act 96 -26) 
 
Public Act 96 -26, the Green Infrastructure for Clean Water Act, requ ired Illinois EPA to assess and evaluate using 
green infrastructure to help manage stormwater in Illinois.  Illinois EPA worked with the University of Illinois - Chicago to undertake research to assess effective best management practices, green infrastruct
ure standards 
and institutional and policy frameworks to support the development of a Green Infrastructure Plan for Illinois.  
This partnership produced a report which included recommendations regarding:  
•Adoption of comprehensive stormwater management rule s; 
•Implementation of a stormwater permit fee program adequate to support the adoption and 
implementation of state stormwater regulations;  
•Establishment of a statewide standard for stormwater management programs in order to transition 
toward the use of green infrastructure as the predominant stormwater management strategy;  
•Rules on the distribution of money from the Water Revolving Fund; and  
•Establishment of new criteria which prioritize the use of green infrastructure in all projects involving 
stormwater management and water efficiency.  
 
In recent years, Illinois has experienced a groundswell of the adoption of green infrastructure practices.  Many programs and best management practices have been applied in the Chicagoland area, the Metro -East area of St. 
Louis, and more urbanized areas throughout the remainder of the state.  
 
Federal and state programs, such as the Green Reserve (State Revolving Fund), Illinois Green Infrastructure 
Grant Program and the Millennium Reserve are assisting local watershed stakeho lders to expand their inventory 
of applied urban stormwater management projects.    42 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013

Agricu lture is the most frequently identified source of stream related NPS pollution in Illinois.  
Hydrologic modifications, urban runoff, and resource extraction are other major NPS contributing to streams not attaining full support ratings.  Fecal coliform,  dissolved oxygen, alteration in streamside or 
littoral vegetative cover, sedimentation/siltation, phosphorus, nitrogen, and total suspended soils were the greatest NPS related causes of streams not attaining full support ratings.

 Causes of NPS Impairment  2.88  
Nutrients - phosphorus and nitrogen 2. 88.1 
Both phosphorus and nitrogen are essential 
nutrients for the growth of aquatic vegetation.  
 Phosphorus is essential for the growth of algae 
and other aquatic organisms.  Serious problems 
such as algae blooms and fish kills have resulted when excess phosphorus exists in the aquatic environment.  
 Nitrogen is a complex element that can exist in seven states of oxidation.  From a water quality standpoint, the nitroge n-containing 
compounds that are of most interest are organic nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate, and nitrogen gas.    Nutrient enrichment of surface waters may cause excessive algae and aquatic plant growth.   This creates 
large diurnal oxygen fluctuations due to excessive DO production during daylight hours , followed by 
excessive consumption of oxygen (mainly through plant dieoff) when photosynthesis is not occurring.  Seasonal die -off of vegetation due to frost may also create large oxygen demands and suffocate fi sh and 
aquatic organisms.  Physical impediments to fishing and boating and operation of water supply facilities can also be affected when vegetation becomes so overgrown that leaves and roots clog motors and intakes.  
 
Nitrate contaminants in drinking water  significantly above the drinking water standard (10mg/L) may 
cause methemoglobinemia (a  blood disease) in infants and has  forced closure of several water supplies.  
High ammonia concentrations in water are also toxic to fish and cause an odor problem.  
Pathogens 2. 88.2 
Pathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and viruses include infectious agents and disease -producing organisms 
normally associated with human and animal wastes.  Waterborne pathogens can be transmitted to 
humans or animals through drinking water suppli es, direct contact recreation, or consumption of 
contaminated shellfish.  Bacterial pathogens of concern include V. chloreae , Salmonellae , and Shigella.  
Pathogenic protozoan eggs and cysts have been linked to Giardia lambia and Entamoeba histolytica 
(amoe bic dysentery). Viruses ingested from water can lead to diseases such as hepatitis.
35 
 Detection methods for pathogenic bacteria are severely limited because of the difficulty in isolating a small number of cells.  Consequently, in spite of problems establi shing direct correlations, coliform 
groups can serve as indicators of pathogens.  Fecal coliform bacteria behave similarly to common enteric 
pathogens, and a close relationship exists between the growth and survival of fecal coliform and both Salmonella and Shigella .

Figure 22 - The Nitrogen Cycle  45 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Dissolved oxygen (DO) 2. 88.3 
Dissolved Oxygen ( DO) is defined as the 
amount of oxygen dissolved in water.  The 
presence of oxygen is of fundamental importance in maintaining aquatic life and the aesthetic quality of waters.  Low DO 
concentrations may harm fish and aquatic 
biota.  Fish tolerance of low DO levels varies by species, growth cycle, acclimation time, and temperature.  Cold water fish (e.g., salmon and trout) require higher DO concentrations than do warm water fish and biota.  The  preferred DO level for trout is 
generally greater than 5 mg/L.  Some fish, if acclimated, can tolerate periods of oxygen levels as low as 2 mg/L but for most species, the longer -term effects of such low DO are 
not well known.  
 Additional to low DO, supersaturation and significant DO swings can result from excessive algae or other plant life and can have a negative effect  on aquatic organisms.  
 
Total suspended solids (TSS) 2. 88.4 
Total suspended solids include both sediment and organic material suspended in  water, unlike 
suspended sediment concentration measurements that only include inorganic material.  TSS can cause 
problems for fish by clogging gills and for aquatic plants by limiting growth because of reduced light penetration.  In addition, TSS provides  a medium for the accumulation and transport of other 
constituents such as phosphorus and bacteria.  
 TSS also decreases recreational values, adds to the mechanical wear of water supply pumps and distribution systems, and adds to treatment costs for water s upplies.  TSS may also provide a mechanism 
for transport of pesticides or other toxic compounds.  
 
Chloride 2. 88.5 
Chloride , an ionic form of the element chlorine, is found in many common salts and is readily soluble.  In 
its dissolved form, it does not degrade chemically or organically over time.  Chloride should not be 
confused with chlorine, a soluble substance often used as a disinfectant.  Reverse osmosis and distillation are potential methods of removing chloride from water.  
 Chloride has not always be en viewed as a pollutant or contaminant of water.  It is an essential part of 
the diet of humans and other animals, and the oceans have a normal, healthy, chloride concentration.  However, elevated concentrations of chloride in fresh water can threaten aqu atic life.  The impact of 
chloride on aquatic life varies from species to species.

Pollutant versus Pollution  
 
The CWA defines a pollutant as “dredged spoil, solid waste, 
incinerator residue, sewag e, garbage, sewage sludge, 
munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, 
radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discarded 
equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal, 
and agricultural waste discharged into water .”  In general, 
polluta nts are substances, chemicals, materials or wastes 
and their components that are discharged into the water.   
 
The CWA defined pollution as “the man- made or man-
induced alteration of the chemical, physical, biological, and 
radiological integrity of a water  body.”   This is a broad term 
that encompasses many types of changes to a water body, 
including alterations that do not result from the 
introduction of a specific pollutant or the presence of 
pollutants at a level that causes impairment.  In other 
words, a ll wa ters impaired by human intervention suffer 
from some form of pollution.   46 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 pH (acidity) 2. 88.6 
pH represents the concentration of hydrogen ions in water and thus indicates the acidity of the water.  
As water becomes more basic, pH increases; as water becomes more acidic, pH decreases.  pH affects the reaction and equilibrium relationships of many chemicals.   Many water quality biological systems function only in relatively narrow pH ranges (typically 6.5 to 8.5).  Fish and other aquatic specie s prefer a 
pH near neutral (7) but can withstand a pH in the range of about 6 to 8.5.  Low pH in water inhibits 
enzymatic activity aquatic organisms.  The toxicity of many compounds can also be altered if the pH is 
changed.  The solubility of many metals, as well as other compounds, is affected by pH, resulting in increased toxicity in the lower pH range.  
Temperature  2.88 .7 
Elevated stream temperatures can stress and cause behavioral changes in fish populations and other biota.  Warmer water temperatures can change aquatic community assemblages, reduce growth rates, and increase disease.  
 Although land use impacts generally elevate stream temperatures, vegetation removal may cause cooler 
water temperatures during the winter.  Cooler winter water temperatures  may reduce growth of fish 
and can also cause the formation of anchor ice that smothers aquatic life in the stream substrate.  
 
Temperature can also affect a number of other important water quality parameters.  Gas solubility decreases with increasing temperature, resulting in generally lower DO concentrations and reaeration rates.  With temperature increases, chemical and biochemical reaction rates typically increase markedly and mineral solubility increases.  Most organisms have distinct temperature ranges  within which they 
can reproduce and compete effectively.  
Pesticides  2.88 .8 
Pesticides are most commonly used in agricultural or urban residential applications for the control of weeds and pest organisms.  The presence of these substances in water is troub lesome because they are 
toxic to most aquatic organisms and many are known or suspected carcinogens.  Potential impairments from pesticides include damage to aquatic fauna and concerns for human health (contamination of domestic water supply or fisher).  C oncentration levels rather than overall loadings are most important.  
Contamination of groundwater by organic chemicals can occur through leaching.  
Metals  2.88 .9 
Heavy metals are a group of elemental pollutants including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper,  lead, 
mercury, nickel, selenium, and zinc.  Industries such as electroplating, battery manufacturing, mining, 
smelting, and refining have been identified as potential sources of heavy metals.  Metals may enter 
surface waters either dissolved in runoff or attached to sediment or organic materials.  Metals can also enter groundwater through soil infiltration.  
 Metals can have toxic effects on humans, fish, wildlife, and microorganisms.  Since metals do not readily decay, their persistence in the environment is a problem potentially contributing to long -term habitat 
and public water supply degradation.  A pr incipal concern about metals in surface water is their entry 
into the food chain at relatively low concentrations and their bioaccumulation over time to to xic levels.  
High concentrations of arsenic can cause dermal and nervous system toxicity effects; high concentrations of cadmium can cause kidney effects; and high concentrations of chromium have been linked to liver and kidney effects.  Lead can result in  central nervous system damage and kidney effects 
and is also highly toxic to infants and pregnant women.  High concentrations of mercury can cause central nervous system disorders and kidney effects; high concentrations of selenium have gastrointestinal e ffects; and high concentrations of silver can cause skin discoloration.  47 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Other toxic chemicals  2.88 .10 
Thousands of industrial and petroleum processing chemicals such as plasticizers, solvents, waxes, 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) make up the final group of toxic substances.  Alkyl phthalates, chlorinated benzenes, PCBs, and PAHs are broad subcategories in this group.  Some chemicals are carcinogenic directly to humans, while others affect fish, aquatic organis ms, or plants within the water column or  in the benthic sediment layer.   Toxicity -based water 
quality standards protective of aquatic life have been adopted to protect fish, fish food organisms (invertebrates) and plant growth from individual harmful subst ances.  
Best Management Practices (BMPs)  2.89  
NPS pollution control in Illinois depends upon the correct selection , design,  installation, operation, and 
maintenance of best management practices ( BMPs ) for a specific site .  BMPs can reduce  or control  NPS 
pollution IF the BMP is designed and sited correctly.  Not all BMPs work in all locations.  It is strongly 
recommended, that anyone considering the implementation of a BMP or treatment train (multiple linked BMPs), consult the advice of a professional, such a s NRCS staff, an environmental consulting firm,  
or a certified professional civil engineer that ha s work  experience in the area of stormwater runoff, 
hydrology, and erosion control .  Many of the Program partners also have staff that can help guide 
landowne rs to select the most appropriate BMP for their property.  
 BMPs, installation techniques , materials used, and operation and maintenance requirements are 
constantly improving.  T he two leading sources of information for BMPs  in Illinois are the:  
 
• Field Offi ce Technical Guide * – USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service  
• Illinois Urban Manual * – Association of Illinois Soil & Water Conservation Districts  
  * Links for these documents are located at the front of the document.  
  48 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Chapter 3 – The Program  3.0 
The goal of the Program is to reduce NPS pollution and meet water quality standards; see Chapter 1 for 
additional details.  NPS pollution is the leading factor for waters in Illinois not attaining their designated 
uses.  The success of NPS pollution control in Illinois is dependent not only on actions and resources from Illinois EPA and U.S. EPA, but many federal, state, and local partners, including individual urban and rural landowners.   
 The Illinois NPS Management Program is a road map for Illinois’ NPS pollution control activities, and guides the implementation of the activities and projects supported by Section 319(h) grant funds (see Chapter 4) and other NPS control activities in Illinois.  The Section 319(h) grant program provides a 
sturdy foundation i n Illinois for NPS pollution  control and is an important Program tool.  The activities 
implemented through the Section 319(h) grant program support Illinois’ effort to reach many of the short and medium -term objectives and milestone documented in Chapter 7.  
 To include each action required to solve Illinois’ NPS pollution problem within this Program is impossible.  Physical changes that are constantly occurring in Illinois, such as streambank erosion and land development, make a static program ineffective  for the 
control of NPS pollution.  The Program must be dynamic and allow 
for fluctuating resource availability and the ever- changing 
landscape of what is currently impairing Illinois’ waters.  Adaptive 
management will be integral to the implementation of the Program.  The Program provides specific strategies, objectives and milestones that, when implemented in concert with watershed-based plans (WBP), Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) and Load Reduction Strategy (LRS) implementation plans and other partner efforts will reduce water quality impairments caused by NPS 
pollution.   The Program will be integrated into other state and federal programs to best leverage available resources as opportunities to do so are identified.  
 The Program recommends that priorit y for the use of financial 
assistance state -wide be guided by existing approved WBP, and 
TMDL, and LRS implementation plans.  Areas with NPS pollution impaired water resources that are not covered by an approved WBP, TMDL, or LRS are recommended for assist ance to develop 
plans for implementation or for the installation of demonstrative BMPs to encourage participating in watershed planning efforts.  
Support should also be provided for projects and programs that 
help prevent NPS pollution from occurring.  
 The major activities and programs implemented by our core 
partners to control NPS pollution are listed at the end of  this 
chapter and are also used, as appropriate, as documentation toward the completion of the objectives and milestones listed in Chapter 7.   In addition, federal, state, and local regulations that deal with 
activities that have potential to cause NPS pollution are also included  in the chapter . 
  
When is NPS pollution not NPS 
pollution?  
 
In Chapter 1, NPS pollution is defined as a physical process 
that occurs 
throughout our state.  However, in 
areas where this physical process is 
regulated by state or federal law it is 
not considered to be NPS pollution 
and is not  covered by the Program.  
Rather, discharges from such activities are covered by the National Pollutant 
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) 
permitting program.   Examples of this 
include active mine sites, certain 
livestock operations, areas greater 
than 1.0 acres that are disturbed for 
non-agricultural activities and 
urbanized areas that receive an MS4 
Permit to manage stormwater.  
 
The Program does  recognize the  
physical process as NPS pollution from 
mine land abandoned prior to 1972, 
certain livestock pasture and grazing 
issues, and land disturbance activities 
on sites less than 1.0 acres in size.  
 49 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Illinois’  Approach to NPS Pollution Control 3.1 
To meet the mission and goals identified in Chapter 1, Illinois will rely upon both a state -wide effort and 
distinct management activities at the watershed- scale to control NPS pollution.  This approach will 
depend upon the use of adaptive management to implement  the Program as efficiently as possible, to  
address  the current needs with the resources available.  The approach is flexible enough to allow Illinois 
EPA and its partners to focus and, when necessary, refocus the Program’s implementation as priorities 
and areas of concern are updated.  The Program  will support the development and implementation of 
NPS components of WBP, and TMDL, and LRS implementation plans as they are the key to control NPS 
pollution in Illinois.  With this common goal, the efforts and activities  are closely related and will be 
man aged with as much uniformity as possible.  
State -Wide Effort  3.11 
The intensity of NPS pollution control in Illinois varies greatly from partner to partner, county to county, 
and acre to acre.  Illinois is home to cutting -edge watershed planning groups as w ell as areas where the 
typical citizen has never heard of a watershed or a planning effort to protect local water quality from NPS pollution.  The Program’s state -wide effort acknowledges this diversity of awareness and knowledge 
and provides programs, projects, and tools that encourage and support individuals and groups at varying levels to improve and then maintain their NPS pollution control efforts.  
 A variety of voluntary federal, state, and local programs provide technical and financial assistance and  
tools to implement  NPS pollution control in Illinois.  There  are also regulatory programs, laws, and acts 
at the federal, state, and local level to protect Illino is’ water resources.  Some of these were created 
specifically to address NPS pollution, while  other s were developed to solve another issue but have 
shown a history of NPS pollution control benefits in addition to their expected benefit.  A list of the programs, laws, and acts is provided at the end of this chapter; followed by brief narratives of a selection of these programs, laws, and acts.  All of the programs, laws, and acts listed play a part of the Program; however, their mission dictates how much of it is directly applied to NPS pollution control or influenced by the Program regarding priori ties for implementation.   
 The state -wide effort  will establish approaches and tools that will 
be useful in most watershed s.  An example is the Illinois Urban 
Manual, described in the box to the right.  Another example is the 
development of a nutrient st rategy.  The nutrient strategy in 
concert wit h Partner programs such as Keep It for the Crops – 2025 
(KIC2025) and USDA – NRCS’s one -on-one nutrient management 
plan development  for agricultural producers will provide options 
for efficient implementation of  NPS pollution control programs, 
projects and practices ; especially the execution of NPS 
components of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans.  
 The components of the state -wide effort  include: federal, state, 
and local partnerships, monitoring, assessments, capacity building, planning, BMP demonstration, and outreach activities.  These components are described later in this chapter.  
 The state -wide effort  relies upon strong partner communication 
and program coordination and voluntary participation for the implementation of the majority of the components.  
Illinois Urban Manual (IUM): A State -
Wide NPS Tool  
 
The IUM i s a great example of a tool 
developed to help control NPS 
pollution in Illinois.  The IUM 
documents the standards and 
specifications for installation of urban 
BMPs in Illinois.  
 
Citizens in Chicago, Carbon Cliff, and 
Carbondale can all make use of the 
IUM to get the specific details for 
installation of a BMP such as a 
permeable pavement system or 
bioswale.  50 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Both technical and financial assistance is used to support  the 
state -wide effort .  Assistance is provided through the 
programs, laws, and acts listed in Table s 11 - 16.  Program 
partners work  together to l everage federal, state, and local 
assistance to accomplish the largest amount of NPS pollution 
control possible with the limited resources available.  One -on-
one communications between partners, memorandums of understanding, project/program peer review and  the NPS 
Management Biennial Meeting are examples of the opportunities used by Program partners to coordinate priority 
areas for implementation and work to leverage financial and 
technical resources.  The NRCS facilitated State Technical Committee and the Illinois EPA Bureau of Water Annual 
Hearing provide recurring opportunities to share Program priorities and areas of concern with the Program’s federal and state partners.  
 The state -wide effort  supports capacity building for Program 
partners and watershed  groups to help them better develop 
and implement WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans for NPS pollution control  Capacity building includes the development of programs and tools, such as the Illinois Urban 
Manual  and the Guidance for Developing Watershed Action 
Plans in Illinois . 
 The state -wide effort  also includes programs and projects that 
encourage individual citizens to make wise choices to control NPS pollution on their private property.  This occurs through progressive outreach efforts and the ap plication of 
demonstrative BMPs.  
 The state -wide effort  will:  
• Ensure communication and coordination between Program partners to leverage resources in the priority areas of the state (e.g., CREP) to reduce NPS pollution in a multiple watershed or other large areas.  
• Build NPS partners and existing watershed group’s capacity to succeed in the area of WBP 
development and implementation of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans.  This includes 
tools and training to help watershed groups use water quality and technology based actions and activities to control NPS pollution in Illinois and to become and remain sustainable for long -term 
water quality protection at the local level.  
• Encourage citizens to control and prevent NPS pollution by applying appropriate BMPs on 
private property and through their day -to-day actions and to actively participate in local 
watershed planning and implementation projects.  
• Provide an opportunity to implement NPS pollution control projects and programs statewide 
and reach areas not alre ady covered by a local WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plan.  
• Allow Illinois EPA to continue work with partners that voluntarily approach the agency for assistance to control NPS pollution at either specific sites or on a larger scale.  
  
Partners Protecting Multiple Watersheds  
 
The Conservation Reserve Enhancement 
Program (CREP) is a great example of a 
federal, state, and local partner s upported 
program that has reduced NPS pollution in 
multiple watersheds.  
 
CREP is a voluntary, incentive -based 
conservation program for private 
landowners in the Illinois and Kaskaskia 
River Basins to establish conservation 
practices on erodible lands to reduce runoff 
and sedimentation of waterways and 
enhance fish and wildlife habitat.  
 
Beyond traditional CREP, Illinois has 
partnerships that have provided financial 
and technical support to local soil and 
water conservation districts (SWCD) to 
employ CREP as sistants.  The addition of 
these staff has helped streamline the CREP application process and have allowed local 
SWCDs to maintain their normal workload 
even with the addition of such a massive 
conservation program.

Illinois Statewide Nutrient Reductio n Strategy  
 
The impact of excess nitrogen and phosphorus in Illinois rivers, lakes, streams and the Gulf of 
Mexico is a very high profile water quality issue.  Under the right conditions, nutrients can cause excessive algal blooms, low oxygen and nuisance 
conditions that adversely impact aquatic life, 
drinking water and recreational uses of the water.  
 Nutrients can come from many sources, including: 
•Fertilizers from agriculture, golf courses, and suburban lawns  
•Erosion of nutrient -rich soils  
•Discharges fro m industrial and sewage treatment plants  
•Failing on -site septic systems and  
•Deposition of atmospheric nitrogen  
 
In other words, most aspects of modern society contribute to this pollution problem.  The 
proportion of loading to a particular waterbody from t hese sources varies from watershed to 
watershed, and includes point sources and NPS pollution sources, in both urban and agricultural landscapes.  
 Illinois EPA hosted meetings in 2010 for stakeholders representing government, environmental groups, municipa l and industrial wastewater dischargers, agricultural groups, academia, non-
governmental organizations and consulting firms with an interest in the topic of nutrient pollution.  This was the beginning of a collaborative, problem -solving process to craft a statewide Nutrient 
Reduction Strategy to address excess nutrients in Illinois waters and the Gulf of Mexico.  
 
Illinois EPA hosted a meeting of stakeholders in March, 2013, to announce that development of a statewide Nutrient Reduction Strategy was beginnin
g.  Approximately 100 attendees were 
present, representing the agricultural community, wastewater dischargers, environmental groups, government, technical assistance provides and academia.  
 
The University of Illinois began conducting a scientific assessment in March 2013, to support an 
Illinois Nutrient Reduction Strategy.  This project will compile a comprehensive statewide 
assessment of the current conditions and practices affecting nutrient losses to Illinois waters.  The assessment will identify and ass
ess nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) inputs and management 
practices, including current cropping practices, phosphorus losses, develop nutrient balance to 
understand the direction of soil pools,  identify and estimate point source influences and 
determine  total nitrogen, nitrate, total phosphorus and dissolved relative phosphorus loads 
leaving the state annually.  
 
A Nutrient Reduction Strategy Policy Working Group has been formed to formulate the action steps for the strategy document, using the results of  
the science assessment; they will craft a 
strategy that is effective and implementable.

 Watershed -Scale Management Activities  3.12 
The watershed -scale management activities  focus NPS pollution control efforts at the 10 – 12 digit HUC 
level or smaller; implementing NPS pollution control activities for specific waterbodies, sets of 
waterbody segments, or watersheds to attain full use support.  These activities  support everything 
within the state -wide effort but goes a step farther to include activities to ensure the voluntary 1) 
development or updates of WBPs, 2) ‘on- the-ground’ implementation of NPS components  (BMPs and 
education outreach activities) of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans, 3) tracking plan implementation, and 4) follow -up monitoring efforts.  
 The watershed -scale management activities  will use coordination of federal, state, and local resources 
to get the local community to a point, both technically and financial ly, where they can voluntarily apply 
NPS components of WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plans in priority areas to attain full use support for priority waterbody segments.  Program partners need up -to-date local water quality data and 
information regarding local WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plans to be able to commit resources to address the issues of specific waterbodies  that have been identified as having been impaired by NPS 
pollution.  
A Systematic Approach 3.2  
In an effort to help focus federal, state, and local resources on watersheds in need of NPS pollution control, Illinois EPA has implemented a systematic approach to pinpoint areas of the state that need a WBP, TMDL, or LRS  implementation plan developed or, if already completed, its approved NPS 
components implemented.  Outreach by Illinois EPA to Program partners will notify them regarding which impaired waterbodies  and watershed need NPS pollution control; which in turn will help the 
partners to leverage technical and financial resources in those areas.  In addition to contacting the regular Program partners, other organizations that have jurisdiction or an interest in an impaired waterbody will also be included in outreach  efforts.  The NPS pollution control priority watersheds and 
interests will be made public, on an annual basis, during the Illinois EPA Bureau of Water Annual Hearing.  
 Illinois EPA and Program partners currently conduct water quality monitoring throughout  Illinois 
according to the Illinois Water Monitoring Strategy  2007 - 2012  (Strategy).  The results of these 
monitoring efforts are released every two years in the Illinois Integrated Water Quality Report and 
Section 303(d) List .  The 2012 IR  includes a lis t of which waterbody segments are impaired and the 
causes and sources of impairment that keep the waterbody segment from attaining full use support.   
Nonpoint Source Unit staff use the monitoring  results and the IR  to establish which waterbody segments 
are impaired by NPS pollution.   See the end of this chapter  for more details about water quality 
monitoring in Illinois.  
 The Program will follow the rotational monitoring plan developed for the Strategy.  This will ensure the use of the most recent water qua lity information available, which is essential to set appropriate 
priorities for implementation of NPS pollution control efforts in Illinois.   The Strategy divides Illinois into 51 basins; a subset (8 – 11) of the basins are monitored each year; with 51 basins monitored by the end 
of the five -year schedule.   The Strategy, like the Program, is a living document; it is updated on a five -
year schedule.  The Program will be updated as future versions of the Strategy are completed.  
 This approach allows Illinoi s EPA, and Program partners, to focus technical and financial assistance 
within specific watersheds in specific years.  Using the Strategy means that the priority waters are those most recently confirmed to have been impacted by NPS pollution.  The approach includes the following 
steps:   53 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Step 1 – Monitoring  3.21 – The water quality monitoring is conducted primarily by Illinois EPA and 
Illinois D NR staff using a number of different monitoring programs.  See the end of this chapter  for 
additional details about monitoring programs used to determine NPS pollution impaired waters in 
Illinois.  The monitoring is conducted for waterbodies and waterbody segments within the watersheds according to the Strategy  monitoring schedule (see Figure 23).  The quality assured - quality controlled  
monitoring data is included in the 2012 IR .  The information provided includes: water quality use 
attainment and the sources and causes applicable to the specific impaired waterbody segments.  
 
Step 2 – Identifying Priority Watersheds and Waterbody 
Segments  3.22 – The Strategy identifies which watersheds 
are to be monitored within a given year  during the five -year 
monitoring rotation.  The water quality data gathered from within those watersheds will determine the specific 10 – 12 
digit  HUCs and waterbody segments that are to be a priority 
for a given year.  See Appendix 1 for maps depicting which 
watersheds are priorities for monitoring , planning, and 
implementation assistance during FY 201 4 – 2018. 
 Waterbody segments, with the excepti on of mainstem waters 
that are not attaining their designated water quality uses due to NPS pollution impairments , are the priority waterbodies.  
The mainstem waterbodies will be upgraded in priority once their headwater areas have developed and implemented NPS components of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans.  
 The 10 to 12- digit HUCs that contain these impaired 
waterbody segments are the priority watersheds.  A higher priority for assistance will be given to those watersheds that have multiple NPS impaired waterbody segments.  
  Step 3 – Outreach to Support Priority Watersheds and Waterbody Segments  3.23 – Illinois EPA’s 
NPS Unit staff will provide, on an annual basis, information regarding the selection of priority watersheds and waterbody segments through the Illinois EPA Web site and at the Illinois EPA Bureau of Water Annual Hearing.  This information will also be provided to Program partners during normal coordination meetings and at other meetings as appropriate including the statewide NPS Biennial  
Management  Meeting.  
 Illinois EPA will conduct outreach activities for federal, state, and local entities that have jurisdiction or a stake in the long -term protection of the NPS impaired waterbodies identified in Step 2.  The outreach 
efforts will explai n the local NPS pollution issues and the watersheds and waterbody segments that are 
impacted.  Outreach efforts will be tailored to the local watershed using the status of existing WBP,  and 
TMDL and LRS implementation plans as a benchmark.  The outreach ef forts will encourage watershed 
stakeholders to consider implementing the most appropriate of the following options:  
Stream Order  
 
Stream order is a measure of the relative 
size of streams.  Stream sizes range from 
the smallest, first -order, to the largest, 
the twelfth -order (the Amazon River).  
 
Over 80 percent of the total length of 
Earth’s rivers and streams are 
headwater streams (first - and second-
order).   
 54 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 1. Actively participate in the development of TMDLs (Phases 1 – 3 as appropriate) and LRSs.  
2. Actively participate in the development of WBPs ac cording to U.S. EPA’s minimum elements  for 
watershed -based plans.  When possible, this action will occur after a TMDL (Stage 1) has been 
approved.  
3. Development of an Implementation Plan for an existing  (pre 2014)  TMDL or LRS.  
4. Implementation of NPS component s of a WBP or TMDL or LRS Implementation Plan  or any other 
plan that meets U.S. EPA’s minimum elements of a watershed -based plan . 
 
This is a voluntary approach; it is going to be the responsibility of the local watershed community or other responsible entity to pursue technical and financial assistance to conduct appropriate activities as 
identified above.  This includes, but is not limited to, application for funding through the Section 319 
grant program or other sources of financial assistance.  
 Step 4 – WBP, TMDL, and LRS Development 3.24 – Illinois EPA will coordinate development of 
TMDLs (Stages 1 – 3, as appropriate) or a LRS for a portion of the priority watersheds identified in Step 2 
of this approach.  The number of TMDLs to be developed will be dependent upon the financial resources available and other priorities guiding the TMDL program.  Once a TMDL or LRS is completed, Illinois EPA will encourage local watershed groups to develop implementation plans for the TMDL or LRS.  The Program will also support any local watershed groups that are interested in developing a WBP prior to a TMDL or LRS.  
 Certain areas of the state have a much higher  rate of success in the area of WBP development and 
implementation.  Illinois EPA will assess the rate of participation for the voluntary development and implementation of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans.  In the event that participation is low, Illinois EPA will look into development of a process to have a third party accomplish a portion of the more difficu lt elements of the WBP process for selected watershed.  The semi -developed WBP would 
then be turned over to local watershed stakeholders to continue the WBP development process.  
 Local groups will be strongly encouraged to secure participation from a wide variety of Program partners to participate on the local Technical Advisory Committee (TAC).  The TAC is a mechanism to not only 
develop the implementation plan, but to also secure federal, state, and local support to fund 
implementation.  
 Illinois EPA will review all WBP, TMDL, and LRSs developed with financial assistance provided through 
the Section 319 Grant Program to make sure that they meet U.S. EPA’s minimum elements of a watershed -based plan.  Those documents that meet the minimum elements will be approved and will be 
eligible to apply for Section 319 funds to implement the plans.  Plans that are developed without Illinois EPA financial assistance will only be reviewed for approval to determine if Section 319 funds can be used 
to help implement the pl an, or as resources allow, if a request for a review is made .    
 Step 5 – Plan Implementation and Tracking 3.25 – Once an implementation plan has been 
completed for the priority watershed, the local community will be encouraged to actively pursue technica l and financial resources for implementation.  An Implementation Plan Tracking Form will be 
provided to the local watershed planning committee to identify components of the plan that address NPS pollution including the site specific information for individ ual BMPs.  The local planning group will 
be encouraged to update the tracking form, at a minimum, on an annual basis.  The tracking information will be shared through RMMS and the Biannual Report with the Program partners to help them identify potential projects to help implement and to identify accomplishments.

Return to Step 1 and start again!  3.26 - At this point, Illinois EPA and Program partners are back 
within the watershed conducting water quality monitoring.  The majority of watershed groups 
partic ipating in this approach will only be a year or two into their plan’s implementation – so significant 
changes in water quality are not anticipated.  The local watershed planning group will have gained experience and can pursue a wide range of technical and  financial assistance to continue execution of 
their implementation plan.  
 Illinois EPA and Program partners will re -prioritize the watersheds and waterbody segments using the 
current Integrated Water Quality Report  and Section 303(d) List  and will start t he process again by 
reaching out to watershed groups to start the process for watershed s that are home to waterbody 
segments that are impaired by NPS pollution.  This process will continue as long as implementation plan development and execution is needed.  
 Illinois EPA will use both technical and financial assistance to implement Watershed -scale management 
activities .  Illinois EPA will also identify a specific contact for each watershed (HUC 8) with the 
Watershed Management Section as a ‘Watershed Contact’ to help local watershed groups and other Program partners to access information from Illinois EPA that is pertinent to the specific 10 -digit HUC 
watershed.

 Components of State -Wide Effort and Watershed -Scale Management Activities  3.3 
The components described below will be used within both the  state -wide and watershed -scale 
management activities  outlined earlier in this chapter.  Both are essential in the control of NPS pollution 
in Illinois.  However, the watershed -scale management activities are currently a higher priority, as Illinois 
needs up- to-date detailed WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans develop ed to identify the site -
specific programs and BMPs needed to control NPS pollution.  
 
The following components will be used for both state -wide efforts and watershed -scale management 
activities : 
• Strong working partnerships and coordination to leverage feder al, state, and local resources for 
improved and increased NPS pollution control efforts;  
• Monitoring and assessment of water resources and citizen knowledge, and as appropriate 
limited research;  
• Capacity building and tool development to support implementati on of NPS pollution control 
efforts;  
• WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plan development;  
• Implementation of NPS components of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans;   
• BMP implementation tracking; and  
• NPS control outreach and information  programs for adults  and students.

 Partnerships  3.31  
The control of NPS pollution in Illinois requires involvement of multiple partners at the federal, state, 
and loca l levels.  The partners ’ involvement ranges from structured day -to-day working relationships 
throughout the life of the Program with core partners to implement multiple programs and projects to impromptu short -term relationships with individual stakeholder s at a specific project site.  The best 
probability to control NPS pollution in Illinois is to encourage coordinated involvement at the local level 
by federal, state, and local partners.  Leveraging resources and programs will be the key to accomplish 
the Program mission.  
 Partnerships with sister agencies and other entities interested in NPS pollution control on a large scale throughout the life of the Program will be more formal in nature and will include the use of tools such as memorandums of understanding, coordination of technical and financial assistance programs, peer review, ordinances, support of the development and implementation of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans, and opportunities for continuous feedback regarding the Program.  The relat ionship with individual stakeholders may be one -sided and occur through outreach and information 
efforts or may become a more formal partnership through the use of financial assistance or other tools, such as conservation easements, to secure NPS pollution  control at a specific project site .  A list of the 
State’s core partners is located in Table 11 .  This list as provided is not inclusive.  A list of partner 
programs relevant to NPS pollution control in Illinois is located in Table 1 2. 
 Illinois EPA will continue to use a combination of formal and informal efforts to sustain the current 
partnerships and to form new partnerships as opportunities surface.  
Monitoring and Assessment  3.32 
Environmental Monitoring and Assessment  3.32. 1 
Monitoring and assessment efforts are an integral part of the Program.  The importance of monitoring for the purpose of defining and designating priority areas in the state, as well as monitoring implemented BMPs on a project basis for evaluation of NPS pollution reduction  and watershed plan 
implementation effectiveness , is essential to reducing NPS pollution for improved water quality in 
Illinois.  
 Information for current monitoring and assessment programs conducted in Illinois  is available at the 
Web pages listed in Table s 12 and 14.  It has been determined that additional monitoring  locations, 
tools, and activities are needed to better define NPS pollution impairments in Illinois.  The Illinois Water 
Monitoring Strategy 2007 – 2012 ( Strategy ) will be updated starting in the fall o f 2013.  This Program 
uses the Strategy  as a foundation  for prioritization and implementation of both the state -wide efforts 
and the watershed -scale management activities , so any updates to the Strategy  will likely require 
updates to the Program in order for it to remain current.  The NPS Unit will work with the Illinois EPA Surface Water Section to improve NPS pollution monitoring and documentation processes in the updated Strategy.  The NPS Unit will also work with the Illinois EPA Groundwater Section to make sure that a solid monitoring program remains in place to help gage Illinois’ NPS pollution problem in Illinois’ groundwater resources.  
 Water quality monitoring activities in Illinois are designed to support and direct other program activities 
by prov iding information on the quality of water resources and to determine the effectiveness of water 
pollution control programs.  This information is established through the collection and assessment of 
water and sediment chemistry,  macroinvertebrates, fish po pulation and species diversity, physical 
habitat, fish tissue residue, bioassay, and stream discharge data.  58 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Both fixed station networks and bioassessment surveys (surface water only) are used to monitor water 
quality in Illinois.  Fixed station networks ar e designed to provide background, current conditions, and 
long -term trend information from a broad geographic area.  Bioassessment surveys are designed to 
provide more intensive, site -specific water resource information to accurately characterize the biolo gical 
integrity of water resources  and the identification of sources, both point and NPS . 
 Monitoring efforts are conducted by the Illinois EPA, Illinois DNR, Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), Illinois Department of Agriculture (IDA), the Prairi e Research Institute  and the U.S. Geological 
Survey  (USGS) .  Interagency coordination reduces the duplication of monitoring, standardizes data units, 
and expands the research database.  The participating agencies test different waterbody  types for a 
variet y of water quality parameters.  Monitoring efforts include problem detection activities and long -
term trend analysis.  
 In accordance with Sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal CWA, the Illinois EPA must report to the U.S. EPA on the quality of Illinois  surface water (e.g., lakes, streams, Lake Michigan, wetlands) and 
groundwater resources (Section 305(b)) and provide a list of those waters where their designated uses are deemed ‘impaired’ (Section 303(d)).  In addition, the Illinois EPA must assess the water quality of lakes in accordance with Section 314(a)(1).  To aid in making these determinations, the Illinois EPA annually collects chemical, physical, biological, habitat, and toxicity data, depending on the type of waterbody .  Data collected from out side sources  may also be considered during this process.  
 Results of the most recent statewide assessments can be found in the 2012 IR  and with the Illinois 
Water Quality Mapping Tool .
37  Previous assessments can be found in ‘Illinois Water Quality Reports’  
and associated ‘Condition of Illinois Water Resources’ reports .38 
 The environmental monitoring programs that relate to NPS pollution are described later in this chapter.  More extended descriptions of these programs are available in Illinois EPA document s such as ‘Illinois 
Water Monitoring Strategy’, “Water Pollution Control Program Plan’, Illinois Fish Contaminant Monitoring Program;, and the ‘ 2012 IR ’
38.   
Social Indicator Monitoring  3.32.2  
Social Indicators for NPS management provide information about awareness, attitudes, constraints, capacity, and behaviors that are expected to lead to water quality improvement and protection.  By measuring these indicators over time, water quality managers can target their project activities and assess whether their projects are accomplishing changes expected to improve and protect water quality.  Monitoring social indicators, like monitoring environmental indicators, provide valuable  information about how well the 
management strategies are working.   Social indicator monitoring will 
be a component of the Section 319 grant program.  
 Social indicators complement other environmental and administrative indicators to present a complete picture of project effectiveness.  Social indicator activities should be designed to help document the need for NPS pollution control and to also validate the

 accomplishments of ongoing and completed NPS pollution control projects.  Illinois has participated in 
multiple pilot social indicator projects that supported U.S. EPA Region 5 ’s multi -state Social Indicator 
Team’s effort to develop the Social Indicators for Planning and Evaluation System (SIPES).  The SIPES tool and handbook can be found at http://greatlakeswater.uwex.edu/ social -indicators
.  Social Indicator 
projects in Illinois related to NPS pollution control should use SIPES to conduct the monitoring effort and to track the data collected.  
Administrative Monitoring  3.32. 3 
The use of administrative monitoring to assess programmatic accomplishments and the need for additional capacity building is fundamental to the Program.  This is an area that is overlooked by many organizations as they delve into program implementation.  However, long -term success, including 
program doc umentation, is necessary to help identify gaps when a project or program is being evaluated 
as well as to track activities in particular watersheds.   Illinois EPA and its partners enlist a wide range of 
tracking tools to accomplish this monitoring.  These tools include, but are not limited to, Resource Management Mapping System ( RMMS ), annual reports, NRCS’s Toolkit, and Grants Reporting and 
Tracking System ( GRTS ).     
Capacity Building  3.33 
NPS pollution control is largely dependent upon the premise that federal, state, and local organizations can efficiently deliver available technical, financial, and educational assistance in impaired watersheds.  Due to the limited personnel at the federal and state levels it is essential that local organizations are equipped to develop and manage the on -the-ground efforts to restore and or protect water quality 
through NPS pollution control.  In turn, federal and state partners need capacity building assistance to be able to train the trainers so that local groups also h ave the capacity and tools to fulfill the role they 
are expected to play.  
 In 2009, the Prairie Rivers Network implemented ‘A Strategy for Building Capacity in Illinois Watersheds Section 319 project’ (FAA 3190424) which developed and implemented a survey to measure the capabilities of active organizations in Illinois that are interested in NPS pollution control through watershed based activities.  
 The Program will follow the findings of the survey to enhance capacity building for NPS Partners and other org anizations that implement NPS pollution control efforts.  A summary of the survey indicated 
that local groups and water resource managers need to hone specific skills in order to be effective in their efforts to control NPS pollutio n. 
 Base d on the finding  from the workshop and through the survey results it was identified that 
information sharing and training needs exist.  It was documented that local groups want help in the following areas:  
• More accessibility to technical information (through activities su ch as shared knowledge), and  
• Fundraising to support goal development and additional funds to implement the goals once developed.  
   60 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 It was recommended that a series of workshops be provided to help strengthen the skills of the 
individuals and groups that work on protecting water resources in Illinois.  Topics for these workshops include:  
• Effective communication,  
• Fundraising  
• Technology related resources,  
• Developing fundable grant proposals,  
• Volunteer water quality monitoring data in decision making, and  
• Third-party TMDLs.  
 Capacity building for NPS Partners and other organizations looks very similar to the general concept of outreach and information – which is described later in this chapter.  However, the audience and the 
messages developed for capacity building are quite different from general NPS pollution control messages and the audiences normally targeted.  Capacity building is more of a ‘train the trainers’ concept.   The staff at o rganizations such as the Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conserva tion 
Districts, IDA, IDNR, RiverWatch, and regional planning commissions can be trained to educate  their 
local counterparts to include NPS pollution control activities as they complete work on their existing programs.  The training for the ‘trainers’ would  not only include the general information, but would also 
include tools and techniques to help them build the capacity at the next level – so that they can also go 
out and share the message and implement the NPS pollution controls needed.   
 
Development of Watershed -based Plan s, Total Maximum Daily Loads, and Load Reduction 
Strategies  3.4 
There is a significant need for development of additional WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans in 
Illinois.  The state supports a voluntary approach to WBP efforts and t he use of the plans as a 
supplement to the TMDL Program.  
 
Voluntary implementation will be used for NPS pollution control for long -term water quality protection.  
A structure d program built on a strong outreach and information strategy is necessary to make  certain 
that the best programs, projects, and BMPs to improve water quality are implemented; let alone any 
action is taken at all.  It is imperative that the local watershed community be involved in the 
development of WBP, TMDL, and LRS Implementation plans.  The local community can identify what 
activities and projects the watershed is likely to support and in many cases, are the harbinger to introduce the plan successfully to the community for implementation.  Leaving the local community, or individual s, out of the planning process most often leads to the failure of development or long -term 
implementation of a WBP.    
Watershed -based Plan s (WBP)  3.41 
Watersheds in Illinois are definitely not a ‘one size fits all’.  Trying to apply the same solutions to al l 
watersheds in Illinois will not work.  Urban watersheds need different programs and practices than do their rural counterparts.  The same can be said for lake and stream watersheds.  The development of a comprehensive WBP developed by the local community  following U.S. EPA’s watershed development 
guidance is the foundation of long -term control of NPS pollution in Illinois.  
 61 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Many of the requests for financial assistance 
received by Illinois EPA are for areas that do not have a WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementa tion plan.  In fact, 
many partners have programs and projects that are not benefitting from the guidance of a local WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plan.  Instead BMPs and programs are being implemented in areas determined by best professional judgment.  While this may reduce NPS pollution at the project site, it is not enough to help Illinois water resources reach full 
use support and be delisted from the 303(d) list.  
 
The Program prioritizes the development of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans in 1 0 to 12-
digit HUCs where NPS water quality impairment has been documented.  The Program also supports plan development in areas smaller than a 12 -digit HUC 
and on occasion larger than a 10 -digit HUC.  WBP 
development is also supported for HUCs where Priori ty Waters for Protection caused by NPS 
pollution has been identified (see Chapter 2) . 
 WBPs need to be developed, through community -
based actions with assistance from technical advisory committees (TAC).  An approvable  plan will identify 
critical areas, ap propriate types of control measures, 
and programs (both regulatory and non -regulatory) 
to achieve implementation of the NPS pollution control measures, including; technical assistance, financial assistance, education, training, technology 
transfer, demonstration projects and watershed -
wide BMP implementation, monitoring, and tracking.  
 
The local community, including local decision makers, is the key player in the development and adoption of a successful WBP for NPS pollution control.  Continued involvement in the WBP process can be very cumbersome and many local volunteer partners struggle to complete the process.  A challenge with some beginner watershed planning groups is that the planning efforts start off addressing NPS pollution control, but end up focused on an issue such as flooding or invasive species or just a subset of the NPS pollution issues that are occurring.  A mechanism is needed to keep efforts on track and focused on water quality, specifically NPS pollution control.  
 A number of U.S. EPA’s minimum  elements can be provided, by an outside source, to the local 
community for their use in planning.  By supplying these elements, such as through TMDL development, many locally -lead WBP efforts will be able to complete the WBP due to the reduced inve stment of 
resources required.  The presentation of elements 1 and 2, by an outside source, can also ensure that local communities remain focused on the issue of NPS pollution control instead of flood control or habitat improvement.  To that end, the Program will support third party development of several of the WBP elements to allow an abbreviated planning effort by the local community in order to develop and implement an acceptable WBP.

The voluntary approach to the development of WBPs has worked well in some areas of the state and has not been very successful in other areas.  A local entity or champion is necessary to start the effort and then to keep the momentum going.  In the past, organizations such as the NRCS did promote and conduct planning efforts  to protect local waterbodies  at the request of the local community.  However, 
active support of watershed planning has been significantly reduced as NRCS focuses on other conservation program areas .  To contrast the current trend, the voluntary approach w ill be 
supplemented with focused outreach activities to reinvigorate local stakeholders to invest energy in watershed -based planning and once the plans are completed to move on to plan implementation in a 
timely manner.  
 The development of the WBP can be conducted before, during or after the completion of an approved TMDL.  It is considered optimum to complete the WBP at the conclusion of the TMDL -Stage 3 in order to 
leverage work completed by another entity.  In that case, the information developed for the  TMDL will 
allow for an abbreviated WBP effort, since many of the elements of a well -designed WBP would already 
be available through the TMDL.  
 In select cases an extensive WBP may not be necessary and an alternative plan, which still addresses the minimum  elements in a meaningful way, may be sufficient to guide watershed project implementation 
of NPS pollution controls.  The use of alternative plans may occur under the following conditions;  
• When the impairment is not specific to a pollutant 
• When responding  to a NPS pollution emergency or urgent NPS public health risk  
• When protecting assessed unimpaired/high quality waters  
• When addressing an isolated, small -scale water quality problem resulting from one or a few 
sources of pollution  
 The alternative plans must directly address priorities outlined in the Program and reflect a geographically -appropriate scale to achieve water quality goals.  The elements that should be fully 
addressed are:  
• The identification of causes of impairment and pollutant sources or grou ps of similar sources 
that need to be controlled to achieve needed load reductions (element a)  
• A description of the NPS management measures that will need to be implemented to achieve 
load reductions and a description of the critical areas in which those m easures will be 
implemented (element c)  
• A description of interim measureable milestones for determining whether NPS management measures or other control actions are being implemented (element g)  
 
The exception of a minimum element plan will be considered when an emergency condition has been declared, such as fires, floods, tornados, and blow downs.  Documentation needed for an alternative plan and project proposal should include:  
• The emergency determination or declaration language  
• Waterbody impacted  
• The aer ial extent of the damage  
• The critical area identified  
• What management measures will be implemented  
• What load reduction is expected  
  63 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)  3.42  
The establishment of a TMDL sets the pollutant reduction 
goal necessary to improve im paired waters.  It determines 
the load, or quantity, of any given pollutant that can be allowed in a particular waterbody .  A TMDL must consider 
all potential sources of pollutants, whether point or NPS.  It 
also takes into account a margin of safety, which reflects scientific uncertainty, as well as the effects of seasonal variation.  
 Developing TMDLs in a watershed begins with the collection of data on factors including water quality, point source discharge, precipitation, soils, geology, topography, and land use (construction, agriculture, mining, etc.) within 
that specific watershed.  All impaired waterbody  segments 
with the watershed are identified, along with the potential pollutants causing the impairments.  
 Next, Illinois EPA determines the tools necessary to develop the TMDL.  In most cases, computer models are used to calculate pollutant loads.  The appropriate model or models are selected based on the pollutants of concern, the amount of data available, and the type of waterbody .  Once 
the model i s selected, the data collected for the watershed 
are entered, and the model is calibrated and verified so that the computed values match those of known field data.  The model can then be used to develop different scenarios, by first determining the amount of specific pollutants each source contributes, then calculating the amount each pollutant needs to be reduced, and finally specifying how the reduced pollutant load would be allocated among the different sources.  
 After the reduced pollutant loads have be en determined, an 
implementation plan is developed for the watershed spelling out the actions necessary to achieve the goals.  The plan specifies limits for point source discharges and recommends BMPs for NPS control .  It also estimates 
associated costs an d lays out a schedule for 
implementation.  Commitment to the implementation plan by citizens who live  and work in the watershed is essential 
to success in reducing the pollutant loads and improving water quality.

 Load Reduction Strategies  (LRS)  3.43  
Load Reduction Strategies (LRS) are generally incorporated into TMDLs 
but can be incorporated into a WBP or act as standalone documents.  
Generally a LRS will be developed during the TMDL process for identified pollutants that are not being address ed by the T MDL.  
Pollutants listed as impairing waters but not being addressed by the 
TMDL are those pollutants for which Illinois does not currently have a 
numeric water quality standard.  For each pollutant addressed under a 
LRS a Load Allocation is developed, but specific sources, (e.g., NPS or point source) are not defined.  As part of the implementation plan for the watershed the LRS is as much of a part of the implementation strategy as the TMDL.  Therefore you will find within an LRS BMPs to address the pollutant(s) and critical areas to focus implementation efforts, including point sources.  The distinction is that the point source implementation activities are not affected by a LRS  until a TMDL is completed for that pollutant.  
Whether the LRS is a component of a TMDL, WBP or is a standalone document it must meet U.S. EPA’s minimum elements for a WBP in order to meet Program criteria.  
 As stated earlier, the Program cannot accommodate all of the information for the exhaustive number of activities, projects, and  programs needed to address Illinois’ NPS pollution.  Local WBP, TMDL (Sta ge 1 – 
3), and LRS implementation plans are the road maps and tools that the watershed community can use to control local  NPS problems.  
 This Program includes the auto -incorporation of the NPS components  of Illinois EPA approved WBP  
(based upon U.S. EPA minimum elements for WBP), TMDL, and LRS implementation plans  that again 
meet the U.S. EPA minimum elements for a WBP .  The BMPs  identified within these plans do not have to 
be identified within this document to be  considered eligible for inclusion in the implementation of the 
Program.  Illinois EPA track s the WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans that are approved  by Illinois 
EPA based upon U.S. EPA’s minimum elements for WBPs .   
Imp lementation of NPS Components of WBP, TMDL, and LRS Implementation Plans  3.5 
As stated above, components of a good implementation plan includes; monitoring, BMP identification and implementation, outreach and information and administrative activities.  The  heart of the Program 
is to get appropriate BMPs implemented, especially in critical areas,  and to modify people’s day -to-day 
activities to reduce NPS pollution.  
 
The BMPs identified for implementation within a plan need to be designed for a specific site.   It is 
imperative that the correct BMP be selected and that it is sited correctly as well.  There are sites where a 
suite of BMPs could be used to control the NPS pollution.  There are other sites where the NPS pollution can only be controlled by a single  type of BMP.  Drainage areas, site use, future development upstream 
of the project site are just a few of the items to consider when selecting and siting a BMP.  The Field Office Technical Guide
39 and Illinois Urban Manual40 are excellent sources of informa tion for BMPs 
currently used to protect water quality in Illinois.  There are a number of other documents that provide substantial information pertaining to BMPs appropriate for NPS pollution control in Illinois.

•Total suspended solids  
•Sedimentation  65 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Illinois EPA strongly encourages the use of a certified professional civil  engineer or an agency such as the 
NRCS to help select and site the most appropriate BMP for NPS pollution control.  There are also a 
number of tools online that can give the benefits and limitations for specific BMPs.  
 When  selecting a BMP for installation – long -term operation and maintenance must be considered.  
BMPs should be operated and maintained for their designed -life spans (e.g., terraces are normally 
designed to last at least 10 years).  A BMP that is not well -main tained or correctly -operated can cause 
more problems than if the BMP was never installed.  Poorly maintained BMPs can cause both an environmental and a social stigma.  Many stakeholders will not install a BMP if they find it ugly or cumbersome to maintain.   A single poorly planned or maintained BMP can wreak havoc in the 
implementation process of a WBP and cause the NPS pollution control to never be realized.  
Outreach and Education  3.6 
Educating the public about the impacts NPS pollution can have on ground water and surface water 
resources and the solutions to abate those impacts are essential if progress in the reduction of NPS pollution is to be realized.  Due to the magnitude and importance of NPS issues, it is imperative that all agencies and organizatio ns involved in NPS pollution reduction address information and education as a 
key component of a ny NPS program initiative.  Major emphasis has been placed on Program efforts 
aimed at soil erosion reduction, livestock waste management, and proper handling and application of fertilizers and pesticides.  Educational materials are available to address the processes of urban and 
rural soil erosion, how to estimate soil loss, assessment of water resources and how to develop not only 
a conservation farm plan, but also a WBP.  
 Additional Program education efforts, such as workshops and webinars, Web sites, technical material development, on- site training  should focus on urban development, construction site erosion control, 
and coordination of community zoning and ordinances through local regional planning commissions.  Reduction of urban stormwater runoff through the use of BMPs should be a high priority in communities throughout Illinois.   
 Federal, state, and local staff available to conduct NPS pollution control outreach and education has 
decreased significantly in recent years.  However, access to materials on the internet can provide much of the information that was previously transferred face -to-face or in hard copy.  It is imperative that 
Illinois EPA and its partners provide information pertaining to which documents and tools are appropriate for use in Illinois.  
 Long -term comprehensive information/education programs assist the local community in making sound 
and timely decisions to best manage their resources  to protect water quality.  An informed and 
educated community can inventory and evaluate water resources, identify water quality concerns, and outline and develop implementation plans to protect water resources.  The community, in turn, may be less depend ent on outside assistance and may be able to start plan implementation sooner than would 
otherwise be possible.  
 Education and outreach projects should target decision makers and promote awareness and implementation of activities that may help to restore i mpaired waters but also may help protect waters 
from degradation due to changing land use activities that increase NPS pollution.  Projects could include statewide or community -based efforts such as training, displays, and workshops.  
 Tools such as the int ernet, conferences, news releases, newsletters and workshops will be used to 
improve information sharing at the federal, state, and local levels.  66 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
  
Illinois EPA host s a state -wide NPS Biennial Management Meeting for 
Illinois EPA staff and partners to interact with those groups and individuals that are committed to reducing NPS pollution to Illinois’ water resources .  The meeting topics will alternate between rural and 
urban issues and will include components that present information on topics such as: WBP, T MDL, and LRS development, BMP technologies 
and application, and use of water quality and technology -based tools.  
The meeting will also be used as a Feedback Loop tool to capture stakeholder and partner needs in regard to the Program.  
Inreach  3.61 
Staff at Illinois EPA ha ve been practicing adaptive management 
throughout the lifespan of the Program.  At the start of the Program, NPS Unit staff spent time researching and educating themselves regarding NPS pollution issues and control techniques to address them.  When resources are stretched to the limit, one of the first 
responsibilities removed is education and continuing knowledge.  Even if time is allocated to pursue information, NPS pollution and the waters it impacts are so diverse that it’s almost impos sible to stay 
well -informed on all of the fronts that need to be covered.  
 Illinois EPA will use a combination of tools to keep Watershed Management Section staff as current as possible on the topics of NPS pollution and its control.  This will allow staff  to continue to provide 
appropriate technical assistance and educational information.  
 Tools such as webinars, conferences, in -house cross training and 
personal development will be used to improve Illinois EPA’s staff’s ability to provide technical assista nce for NPS pollution control to 
local watershed groups and Program partners.  
 
Technical Assistance  3.62 
Technical assistance provided to a WBP committee from a TAC is vital for the cost- effective 
development and execution of an implementation plan.  Many of the Program’s core partners have staff 
available to assist watershed planning groups as they conduct their planning efforts and then during the implementation of the plan.  
 Technical assistance, especially in the area of WBP efforts, is one of the most cost effective components of the Program.  The information provided can be used and reused by the audience at no additional cost.  There is not enough money in the CWA or all of Illinois state programs combined to implement all of the programs, projects, and practices needed to control Illinois’ NPS pollution problems.  However, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent annually in Illinois for projects (from highway and utility improvements to home landscaping), activities and outreach which could help con trol NPS pollution if 
the person coordinating the activity was aware of the needs and potential benefits.  Many of these projects could be slightly modified in their planning stages to incorporate NPS pollution control components.  With the proper information supplied, many citizens would choose to control NPS pollution as possible throughout their day -to-day activities.  
Illinois EPA – Watershed Contacts  
 
In an effort to better coordinate 
technical and educational assistance 
to watershed stakeholders, the Illinois 
EPA Bureau of Water has developed a 
point of contact system within the 
NPS Unit for each of the 51 major 
watersheds.  
 
This contact will focus p rimarily on 
NPS pollution control issues, but will 
also work to facilitate coordination of 
resources to address other water 
quality concerns for the local 
watershed community.  
 
It is anticipated that these points of 
contact will eventually become well 
vers ed in the activities and issues 
encountered within their appointed 
watersheds and can help facilitate 
potential solutions as quickly as 
possible.  67 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Tool Development  3.63 
Illinois EPA and the Program p artners have developed a wide 
range of tools to help plan, implement, document, and track 
NPS pollution control programs, projects and practices throughout Illinois.  These tools range from in -house 
spreadsheets, to technical guides, to web -based modeling 
and calculations, to field testing alternative approaches to 
meet water quality stan dards . 
 Examples of tools developed include:     
 
The Resource Management Mapping Service (RMMS) which utilizes a wide range of coordinated natural resource related databases to provide an online, interactive mapping environment that is designed to help gov ernment agencies, 
non-governmental organizations, and the public evaluate 
and manage geographically -based information about Illinois’ 
natural resources, particularly water resources, so that they can more effectively develop and implement appropriate resou rce protection and enhancement measures.   RMMS is 
maintained by the University of Illinois with support from the Illinois EPA and other state agencies . 
 Water Quality Standards  
The Illinois Pollution Control Board, a sister Agency to the Illinois EPA, prom ulgates water quality 
standards in Illinois.  Two Sections of 35 Illinois Administrative Code (IAC), Section 302, Water Quality Standards and Section 303, Water Use Designations and Site Specific Water Quality Standards contain the standards applicable to lakes and streams.  The Program will be updated as current standards are 
updated and new standards are adopted.  
 TMDL Alternatives – Using alternative approaches to meet water quality standards  
TMDLs are an important tool available to water resource manage rs to allow them to develop a plan with 
targeted goals for bringing an impaired waterbody to fully meeting its Use Support designations.  However, we have discovered that sometimes locally led efforts that don’t involve the traditional Illinois EPA TMDL pr ocess can have a great chance of successfully completing implementation activities that will 
lead to improved water quality.  Some of these efforts can be seen in the following examples:  
 
Fox River Study Group:  
The Fox River Study Group (FRSG) is a diverse  coalition of stakeholders working together to 
assess water quality in the Fox River watershed.  The FRSG began meeting in the summer of 
2001 to address water quality impairments.  Although the emphasis in the original meeting was on monitoring water quality, it soon because clear tha t th e FRSG presented a unique 
opportunity to foster sustainable growth throughout the watershed.  To guide those efforts, the FRSG reached a consensus on the following work plan.  
 The work plan is made up of four phases.  Phase  1 work (data compilation and modeling) was 
conducted by the Illinois State Water Survey.  Part of the Phase II effort began in April 2002 when the FRSG water quality monitoring program started collecting samples at seven sites along 
Illinois EPA uses RMMS to track individual 
BMPs funded by Section 319, Illinois Green 
Infrastructure Grant Program, and other NPS 
pollution control grant programs.  The 
information tracked includes:  
•the type of BMP,  
•completion date,  
•size of the BMP measured in acres, 
feet, or number;  
•location of the BMP, and  
•pollutant load reductions associated with the BMP.   
 
RMMS is also used by Illinois EPA to track 
the development and implementation of 
WBPs in Illinois.  These data, and the reports that can be generated on these data through 
RMMS, are used by Illinois EPA to assist in 
managing both individual grant projec ts and 
the Program.  68 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 the Fox River.  Those data, especially information describing how the w atershed responds to 
storm events, were used in Phase III to calibrate a model of the Fox River watershed.  
 
The fourth and final phase of the work plan is to develop an implementation plan as a management to ol.  The Implementation Plan will be used to:  
• Ensure efficient use of taxpayer and private moneys on watershed projects  
• Assess the effect of various development options throughout the watershed  
• Educate stakeholders  
• Evaluate management priorities  
• Identify sensitive regions within the watershed  
• Develop effective continuing monitoring program; and lastly  
• ‘Assign ’ load reductions to stakeholders to ensure implementation activities.  
 DuPage River/Salt Creek Workgroup  
The DuPage River Salt Creek Workgroup (DRSCW)  formed in 2005 in response to concerns about 
TMDLs being set for the East and West Branches of the DuPage River and Salt Creek.  The DRSCW is made up of local communities, Publically Owned Treatment Works and private environmental organizations.  The DRSCW is committed to producing comprehensive data sets for local watersheds in order to determine and resolve priority stressors to local aquatic systems.  The organization seeks to implement targeted watershed activities that resolve priority waterway problems efficiently and cost effectively.  
 Hickory Creek Watershed  
Residents, village and county leaders and conservation groups began meeting to focus on the challenges facing Hickory Creek and its watershed in 2007.  The group is unusual because much of the l eadership comes from representatives of the seven municipalities that govern most of 
the land in the watershed.  
 The Group is working to effectively reduce NPS pollution, attain water quality and habitat improvements, and engage a wide range of audiences in the Group’s efforts.  This is done by documenting sources of NPS pollutants to facilitate the preparation of action plans, 
implementing simple demonstration BMPs, participating in community education and outreach, 
and lastly, evaluating performance of lo cal BMP projects.  Recently the Group began looking at 
developing a Third Party TMDL in order to bring about both point and NPS pollution reductions.  
Tracking Implementation of WBP, TMDL, and LRS Implementation Plans  3.7 
Both BMP installation and outreach  activity implementation need to be tracked at the watershed and 
state -wide scale.  Tracking administrative activity is also appropriate.  Tracking the implementation of 
the NPS components of local plans and the trends in water quality will guide the long -term application 
of NPS pollution control activities for the local watershed groups.  The information documented will identify areas within specific plans and watersheds where implementation efforts need to increase or 
need to be modified if the anticipate d outcomes are not realized.  As larger areas of the state have WBP, 
TMDL, or LRS i mplementation plans completed, the BMP installation, outreach, and administrative 
activity tracking for the individual plans will help guide future plan development, updates, and 
implementation efforts for larger watershed and river basins.  
 BMP tracking includes documentation of the practice type, units installed, project location, pollutant load reductions, cost and date implemented.  The BMP tracking can be used to help de termine a BMPs 
success at improving local water quality or to determine the BMPs that the local community is willing to 69 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 adopt.  The BMP tracking can, by using the date of installation, also help identify BMPs that are nearing 
the end of their life -span and  when they should be checked for replacement needs.  The outreach 
activity tracking includes the type of activity, the amount of units installed or completed, the cost per unit, and the location of the application.  This information can be used to measure accomplishments through social indicator efforts.  A dministrative tracking can include accumulating information on the 
resource needs to accomplish design, permitting and coordination of the application of the  specific  
BMPs.   It can also include education  and communication efforts to encourage plan implementation by 
everyone from individual land owners to municipalities.  It’s also appropriate to track participation in education and outreach events and the accomplishment of outside partners.     
Illinois E PA tracks Section 319 grant program implementation in U.S. EPA’s Grants Reporting and 
Tracking System (GRTS).  This tool helps Illinois EPA report accomplishments toward the implementation 
of the Section 319 grant program and this Program.  GRTS enables U. S. EPA and Illinois to demonstrate 
the accomplishments achieved with the use of Section 319(h) grant funds.  The data entered into GRTS is also used by U.S. EPA to respond to inquiries received from Congressional committees, the White House, and various constituent groups.  
 Illinois EPA uses the Resource Management Mapping System (RMMS) to track the application of specific BMPs.  RMMS includes geographic information system (GIS) capabilities to map the implementation of BMPs by a variety of criteria, includ ing within a specific watershed, county, BMP type or date installed.  
RMMS users can generate GIS layers for use to enhance their watershed planning and implementation efforts.  Illinois EPA is working with Program partners to increase the amount of information available in the RMMS system.  
Best Management Practices  3.8 
BMPs are the building blocks of NPS pollution control through the execution of a WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plan.  A thorough implementation plan will identify the location, type, amount, and other appropriate details for each BMP that is recommended for implementation.  
 The following table lists BMPs that are normally used to control NPS pollution in Illinois.  The fact that the BMP is listed does not mean that it is an appropriate NP S pollution control practice at all sites.  
 Illinois EPA strongly encourages the use of a certified professional civil engineer or an agency, such as the NRCS, to help select and site the most appropriate BMP for the NPS pollution control for the specific site.  There are also a number of tools online that can give the benefits and limitations for specific BMPs, so that persons interested in NPS pollution control can narrow down the BMPs that they are considering for their property.  
Program Partners  3.9 
The best chance to control NPS pollution in Illinois is to encourage involvement at the local level by 
federal, state, and local partners, especially the local watershed community!  Coordination of resources and programs will be the key to accomplish the Pro gram goals.  
 As st ated earlier, successful NPS pollution control depends upon many people and organizations 
working together.  In Illinois, Program partners can be found at all levels of the spectrum, from federal agencies to local watershed planning groups.  The resources that partners bring to the table vary widely.

Illinois EPA  
 
Ambient Lake Monitoring Program (ALMP)  
Illinois EPA conducts the ALMP at approximately 50 inland lakes annually to diagnose lake problems, encourage development of management plans, and to evaluate the effectiveness of programs implemented.  ALMP monitoring involves the collection of physical data (e.g., temperature/dissolved oxyg en profiles, water clarity, and water color), water and sediment chemical data, and field 
observations, including weather conditions and the presence of algae and macrophytes.  
 
Inland lakes monitoring as part of the ALMP are monitored five times; once during the spring runoff and 
turnover period (April or May), three times during the summer (June, July, August) and once during fall turnover (October).  Data are routinely collected from three distinct lake stations.  Station 1 is the deep lake station.  A ne ar-surface and a near- bottom water sample are collected at this station.  Station 2 is 
generally at mid -lake and Station 3 is typically located in the headwater area of the lake.  Near- surface -
only water samples are collected at Stations 2 and 3.  Water qu ality parameters analyzed include 
suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll.  A sediment grab sample is collected at Stations 1 and 3 once during the sampling season and analyzed for organic and inorganic constitutes.  Lakes that serve as source water for public waters supplies are also sampled for organic and inorganic compounds as part of the Source Water Protection Program.  A more detailed description of the ALMP is available in Lake Notes  brochure.  
 To enhance Illinois EPA’s ability to assess lake t rends, a total of 78 inland lakes have been chosen to be 
included in a trends -monitoring program that began in 1991.  These 78 lakes, collectively known as the 
Ambient Cork Lakes, are sampled on a three- year rotating schedule.  Other ALMP lakes are monitored 
les frequently, usually once every five years.   Ambient Water Quality Monitoring Network (AWQMN)  
Historically, stream water quality data in Illinois have been collected by several state and federal agencies including the Illinois State Water Survey (ISWS), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), 
Illinois EPA, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  This monitoring has resulted in a rich data set from 
streams ranging in size from small agricultural drainage ditches to the Mississippi River.  The present AWQMN design began in Water Year 1977 and included 209 stations through September 
1996.  Beginning in Water Year 2001, the AWQMN was increased to 213 stations.  This network currently includes 202 stations on interior streams and the Wabash River,  sampled by Illinois EPA nine 
times a year on a six -week rotation, and an additional 11 stations sampled quarterly on the Mississippi 
River.  For a comprehensive description of the AWQMN program see Appendix B of the Water Quality Monitoring Strategy.  Thi s will also include details about the program prior to 1977.  
 Illinois EPA uses the AWQMN to (a) provide baseline water quality information; (b) characterize and define trends in the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the Illinois’ waters; (c) identify new or existing water quality problems; and (d) act as a triggering mechanism for special studies or other appropriate actions.   
 Illinois Clean Lakes Program (ICLP)  
The Illinois Clean Lakes Program is a financial assistance grant program that fosters lake owners’ interest and commitment to long -term, comprehensive lake management.  Generally, three to five lakes are 81 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 sampled each year as part of the ICLP.  Grant availability in any given year depends on the level of ICLP 
funding appropriated by the state legislature.  
 The monitoring design follows the ALMP.  However, sampling frequency is enhanced for the ILCP.  For ICLP Phase I and II projects, lake monitoring is generally conducted twice a month from April to October and monthly from November t o March for a one -year period.  Water quality samples are collected from 
one foot below the surface, intake depth (for lakes with a PWS intake), and two feet above the bottom at the deepest station.  Surface samples (one foot below the surface) are also co llected at two other lake 
stations.   
 
In addition, Phase I monitoring includes flow and chemical data collected at major inflows and outflows 
for development of nutrient, sediment, and hydrologic budgets.   
 Additional  Phase I monitoring and mapping activ ities include: major biological resources (i.e., 
phytoplankton, fish populations, aquatic vegetation, and periodically, zooplankton and benthos), bathymetric (water depth) maps, sedimentation surveys, fish contaminant monitoring conducted pursuant to the Fish Contaminant Monitoring Program (FCMP), and surficial or core sediment sampling an analyses.  
 Detailed diagnostic/feasibility studies (Phase I) scientifically document the causes, sources, and magnitude of lake impairment.  Data generated from these mon itoring studies are used to recommend 
lake protection/restoration practices for future implementation.  Final monitoring conducted at the conclusion of the Phase II project is intended to assess the effectiveness of the BMPs implemented during the project.  
 Facility -Related Stream Surveys (FRSS)  
Illinois EPA conducts Facility -Related Stream Surveys (FRSS) primarily on   wadeable streams.  These 
surveys involve the collection of macroinvertebrate, water chemistry, stream flow, and habitat data upstream, and incrementally downstream, from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facility discharges.  The FRSS information is used to evaluate water quality impacts and the need for additional 
wastewater treatment controls.  Data are also used to (a) characte rize the existing and potential aquatic 
resource of each receiving stream; (b) determine whether there is a significant biological impact to the 
receiving stream; and (c) support BOW’s NPDES permit reissuance activities.  Depending on staff resources, 10 to 30 surveys may be conducted annually, usually during July through September.  
 Fish Contaminant Monitoring Program (FCMP)  
Illinois EPA participates in the FCMP in accordance with a memorandum of agreement with IDNR, IDPH, and Illinois Department of Agricu lture.  Fish samples area analyzed for approximately 28 parameters.  
During the 2005 Water Year, 450 fish samples were collected from 100 Illinois inland lakes and streams.  Six fish samples were also collected from the Illinois waters of Lake Michigan.  
The statewide monitoring network consists of the following components: 
• Intensive Basin Survey Samples  
• Follow -up Samples  
• Lower Priority Samples  
• Lake Michigan Samples  
• Special Samples

 Groundwater Monitoring Program (GMP)  
The collection of high quality chemical  data is essential in assessing groundwater programs.  In response 
to this belief, Illinois EPA and the USGS Illinois District Office, located in Urbana, began a cooperative 
effort to implement a pilot groundwater monitoring network (i.e., ambient monitori ng network) in 1984.  
CWS ambient network design started with pilot efforts in 1984, moved to implementation of the ISWS network design for several years, and was followed by sampling all of Illinois’ CWS wells (3,000+) until 1995.  
 From the experience gai ned from this prototype network, Illinois EPA designed a probabilistic 
monitoring network of CWS wells.  The design of this network was completed in coordination with the 
USGS, the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS), and the ISWS, with USGS performing  the detailed 
design.  These network wells were selected using a random stratified probability -based approach (95 
percent statistical confidence in the data with an associated plus or minus five percent precision and 
accuracy level) with a goal of represen ting contamination levels in the population of all active CWS 
wells.  Further, the random selection of the CWS wells was stratified by depth, aquifer type, and the presence of aquifer material within 50 feet of land surface.  Illinois EPA used geological w ell log and 
construction log detail to perform this process.  
 The random stratified selection process included nearly 3,000 CWS wells resulting in 356 fixed monitoring locations.  This probabilistic network is designed to (a) provide an overview of the groundwater conditions in the CWS wells; (b) provide an overview of the groundwater conditions in the 
principle aquifers (e.g., sand and gravel, Silurian, Cambrian -Ordovician, etc.); (c) establish baselines of 
water quality within the principle aquifers; (d) identify trends in groundwater quality in the principle aquifers; and (e) evaluate the long -term effectiveness of the Illinois Groundwater Protection Act, Clean 
Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act program activities in protecting groundwater in Illinois . 
 Illinois EPA utilizes routine monitoring data to determine if deterioration (or improvement) in water quality has occurred over time.  In principle, this information will accurately represent hydrogeologic conditions at a station and enable an understanding of the dynamics of subsurface aquifer systems.  Illinois EPA has determined that the practical elements of a viable long -term groundwater monitoring 
program should include ( a) evaluation of hydrogeologic setting and program information needs, (b) 
evaluation of well performance and purging strategies, and (c) execution of effective sampling protocols 
that include the appropriate selection of sampling mechanisms and materials, as well as sample collection, preservation, and handling procedures.  
 Groundwa ter in Illinois is routinely monitored for biological and chemical contaminants and, to some 
degree, withdrawal rates.  Since 1997, Illinois EPA has operated an ambient network of CWS wells via a rotating approach.  The random stratified probabilistic netw ork consisting of 356 fixed stations is 
sampled every other year to allow the flexibility to conduct special/intensive monitoring during the second year cycle.  
 An average of 350 wells has been maintained since the inception of the probabilistic monitoring  
network in 1996.  When a well in this network is taken out of service, or otherwise not readily able to be sampled, Illinois EPA designates an alternative well with generally the same location, depth, and aquifer properties.  By doing this, Illinois EPA h as historical datasets for over 455 CWS wells that are currently or 
have been previously sampled in the probabilistic network.  
 Since 1993, Illinois EPA has operated a pesticide monitoring subnetwork of the ambient CWS network.

 Illinois Green Infrastru cture Grant Program (IGIG)  
Illinois Green Infrastructure Grants are available to local units of government and other organizations to 
implement green infrastructure best management practices to control stormwater runoff for water quality protection in Illinois.  Projects must be located within a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) or Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) area.   Funding categories include: 1) Combined Sewer 
Overflow Rehabilitation, 2) Stormwater Retention and Infiltration, and 3) Small Proje cts.  Funds are 
limited to the implementation of projects to install best management practices (BMPs).  
 The total amount of funding available under IGIG is approximately $5 million annually.    
Intensive Basin Surveys (IBS)  
Surveys are conducted in selected basins each year by  the Illinois EPA ’s Bureau of Water in cooperation 
with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR).  An IBS is designed to meet several objectives, 
some of which apply only to one of the two cooperating entities.  Basins are selected each year so that statewide coverage is achieved once every five years.  Each year, more than 100 stations are monitoring for biological, chemical, and physical indicators of aquatic resource condition.  
 Intensive Basin Surveys are a major source of information for assessing attainment of aquatic life use in Illinois streams.  At each IBS station, fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages, physical habitat (including stream discharge), and water chemistry are measured or otherwise characterized to determine resource conditions.  Sampling for fish -tissue contaminants and sediment chemistry also is conducted to screen 
for the accumulation of toxic substances.  For IBS sites that occur near an AWQMN site, water chemistry samples from the AWQMN monitoring are used.    Lake Education Assistance Program (LEAP)  
The Lake Education Assistance Program (LEAP) is part of an education initiative offered by the Illinois EPA.  Funding is provided by “Partners for Conservation”.    LEAP funds are available to all school  
children whether they attend public or private schools, and for grades from kindergarten through graduate school.  Funds are also available to not -for-profit organizations.  LEAP has approximately 
$50,000 in available funding per year.  The maximum award per school and/or organization is $500 per 
application period.  
 
The Illinois EPA provides funding for approximately one hundred lake and lake watershed related 
educational field trips, seminars/workshops, projects, and activities per fiscal year .  Projects  and 
activities must have stated goals and involve the enhanced lake/lake watershed education of teachers, students, organizations and/or the community.  
 Lake Michigan Monitoring Program (LMMP)  
Recognizing the great importance of Lake Michigan as a natural  asset, the 75
th Illinois General Assembly 
authorized Illinois EPA through 615 ILCS 5/14a to “ regularly conduct water quality and lake bed surveys 
to evaluate the ecology and quality of water in Lake Michigan.” Since 1977, the Illinois/Indiana portion of Lake Michigan has been monitored under the terms of a cooperative agreement between the city of 
Chicago and Illinois EPA.  
   84 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 The current Lake Michigan Monitoring Program, as conducted by the city of Chicago’s Water Quality 
Surveillance Section, consists of 80 stations on five separate surveys:  
 
• 14  Open Water stations (6 – 18 miles offshore)  
• 23 Jardine Water Purification Plant Radial stations  
• 22 South Water Purification Plant Radial stations  
• 10 North Shore stations (1 -4 miles offshore)  
• 11 South Shore station s (<1 -6 miles offshore)  
 Radial surveys are designed to collect samples within a ten -mile radius of the water purifications plants.  
An ideal monitoring season would consist of 22 surveys; four open water surveys, six radial surveys, and twelve shore surveys.  Water quality parameters routinely collected by the city include water temperature, nutrients, solids, chloride, sulfate, bacteria, and plankton.  
 
Shore surveys are conducted more often than radial and open water surveys.  Generally six north shore 
and six south shore surveys are run each year.  As a result, Illinois EPA attempts to accompany the city of 
Chicago on these shore surveys in order to collect additional information not routinely collected by the city including: metals, cyanide, pesticides, phenols, and field measurements of pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and turbidity.  
 The Lake Michigan Monitoring Program is utilized by Illinois EPA to provide ongoing water quality information to define trends in chemical and biological conditions of t he state’s portion of Lake 
Michigan, to identify new or existing water quality problems, and to review existing water quality standards.  Because of the size of Lake Michigan and the availability of the city of Chicago’s tugboat, as well as weather related problems, significant Illinois EPA staff resources are required to conduct these 
annual surveys.  
 Large Rivers Subnetwork Program (LRSP)  
Illinois EPA participates in various efforts to monitor the environmental conditions of large rivers, including U.S. E PA’s “Survey of the Nation’s Rivers’ project and ongoing large -river sampling and 
biological assessment studies by the Midwest Biodiversity Institute and US EPA Region 5.  
 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)  
The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) has its origin in the Federal Clean Water 
Act.   The program requires permits for the discharge of treated municipal effluent, treated industrial 
effluent and stormwater.  The permits establish the conditions under which the  discharge may occur 
and establish monitoring and reporting requirements.    The NPDES program was implemented in two phases; Phase 1 addressed the most significant sources of pollution in stormwater runoff.  Phase II addresses other sources to protect wat er quality.   
Municipalities located in urban areas are required to obtain NPDES permit coverage for discharges from their municipal separate storm sewer systems.  Municipalities located outside of urbanized areas may need to comply as determined by Illino is EPA. 
 Construction sites that disturb one acre of more are required to have coverage under the NPDES general permit for stormwater discharges from construction site activities.  
Municipalities under 100,000 must also meet the construction site stormwater  requirements and the 
industrial stormwater requirements.  
 85 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Pesticide Monitoring Subnetwork of the Community Water Supply Network (PMS)  
Since 1993, the Illinois EPA has operated a Pesticide Monitoring Subnetwork of the CWS Network.  
Initially, Illinois EPA tested all wells in the CWS Network for triazine and alachlor using immunoassay screening methods.  However, in the 1998 monitoring cycle Illinois EPA discontinued the use of immunoassay and randomly selected 50 percent of the network wells which were then analyzed for 
synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) using standard laboratory test methods.  In the year 2000 monitoring cycle, the remainder of the wells in the network were analyzed for SOCs.  The Illinois EPA anticipates that this rotation will be maintain ed in the future.  
 Priority Lake and Watershed Implementation Program (PLWIP)  
PLWIP is funded through the ‘Partners for Conservation’ program, a long -term,  comprehensive, Illinois 
natural resource protection bill.  PLWIP is a reimbursement grant program de signed to support lake 
protection, restoration and enhancement activities at “priority” lakes where causes and sources of problems are apparent, project sites are highly accessible, project size is relatively small and local entities are in a position to q uickly implement needed treatments.  In general, priority lakes are unique, 
high quality aquatic resources, and/or serve multiple purposes (recreation and public water supply) and are in need of protection or restoration.  
 Small Systems Compliance Grant Program (SSCG)  
The small Systems Compliance Grant Program (SSCG) is an opportunity for small community water supplies that are in noncompliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act and state drinking water requirement, to receive funding from the Illinois EPA to  construct projects that will remedy system 
deficiencies and bring them back into compliance.  
 The total amount of funding available under the SSCG is $2 million.  The amount of funds available for any one compliance project may range from $10,000 to $200,000 and will cover 100 percent of the eligible compliance project cost.  
 Source Water Assessment and Protection Program (SWAP)  
The Illinois EPA is implementing a source water assessment program (SWAP) to assist with wellhead and 
watershed protection of public drinking water supplies.  The 1996 amendments to the federal Safe 
Drinking Water Act established several programs that will help water suppliers continue to provide safe, adequate, and affordable water to their customers.  As required by these amendments, the Illinois EPA, in cooperation with water utilities and other stakeholder, has developed and the U.S. EPA  has approved, 
Illinois’ SWAP.  The purpose of SWAP is to:  
• Identify areas that supply drinking water to the public  
• Inventory potential sources of  contamination  
• Determine the susceptibility of the source water to contamination  
• Information the public of the assessment results  
 Assessments will be conducted for all public water supplies in Illinois, including approximately 1,800 community water supplies.  In addition, more than 4,100 non- community water supplies will be 
assessed.    The Source Water Assessment Program will help communities make important decisions about how to 
protect their drinking water.  By working to ensure safe drinking water supp lies, the health and 
economy of the community, as well as the preservation of natural resources, will be greatly improved.  
 
  86 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program (VLMP)  
The Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program (VLMP) serves as an educational program that teache s Illinois 
citizens about lake ecosystems, contributing to an understanding of lake/watershed relationships and 
promoting informed decision -making.  It also provides a cost -effective method of gathering fundamental 
information about inland lakes.  
 About 175 lakes statewide participate annual in the VLMP.  Water quality monitoring locations for this program are determined in the same manner as the ALMP.  Each VLMP lake generally has three stations: Station 1 is the deep station; Station 2 is at mid -lake and generally mid -depth; and Station 3 is located in 
the headwater area or opposite of Station 2.  Volunteers are requested to monitor each station twice a 
month from May through October.  Volunteers collect Secchi transparency, total depth, and various 
field observations at each station.  Additionally, volunteers collect water quality samples on a monthly 
basis at 100 lakes.  These samples are analyzed for nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll.  In addition to monitoring, volunteers are given a zebra mussel sampler and trained to identify zebra mussels.  The basic VLMP includes training volunteers to measure water clarity (transparency) by using a Secchi disk.  These measurements are used to document changes in the transparency of lake water within a given year, and to develop transparency trends over many years.  Monitoring is conducted twice a 
month from May to October, typically at three stations per lake.  The basic program also includes monitoring for zebra mussels.  The main purpose of this effort is  to determine whether or not zebra 
mussels are being transported from the state’s major rivers to inland lakes.  
 The expanded VLMP includes volunteer collection of water samples from one foot below the surface of the water, in addition to the collection of  Secchi transparency and zebra mussel information.  Samples 
are shipped to Illinois EPA or private laboratories for analysis of basic water quality parameters including: ammonia, nitrates, total phosphorus, as well as total and volatile suspended solids.   
 Chlorophyll sampling and analysis are also performed.  Water samples are collected at twice the Secchi depth, filtered, and sent to the laboratory for analysis.  Chlorophyll data, Secchi transparency 
information, and water quality measurements are used for assessing a lakes’ condition or trophic status.  
 
Wastewater and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRF)  
The State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs include the Water Pollution Control Loan Program for wastewater projects and the Public Water Supply Loan Program for drinking water projects.  These two programs are annually the recipients of federal capitalization funding, which is combined with state matching funds, program repayments, and bond and interest proceeds to form a perpetual source of low intere st financing for environmental infrastructure projects.  The SFR program includes the Green 
Reserve, which makes funds available for green infrastructure, water or energy efficiency improvements, or other environmentally innovative activities.   The SRF program will be the funding conduit for the Clean Water Initiative (CWI), an initiative that will utilize the existing program capacity of the well -developed SRF programs to leverage funding available for water infrastructure.   
 Water Quality and 401 -Certif ication  
Water Quality Standards for Wetlands; water quality standards are an effective tool available to protect the overall health of wetland resources and the valuable functions they provide, including shoreline stabilization, NPS runoff filtration, wild life habitat, and erosion control, which directly benefit adjacent 
and downstream waters.     
 87 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Watershed -Based Monitoring (e.g., Nonpoint Source/BMP, TMDL)  
When monitoring data from various surface water programs are available and relevant to specific CWA 
Section 319 projects, Illinois EPA uses these data to “ …evaluate to the extent that appropriate 
information is available, reductions in NPS pollutant loading and improvements in water quality… resulting from implementation of the management program,” in ac cordance with CWA Section 
319(h)(11).  When monitoring data from various Agency surface water programs or contractual efforts are available and relevant to specific watershed or TMDL plans ; Illinois EPA intends to use these data to 
help develop the plan, t rack its success, and adapt it accordingly.  
 Wellhead Protection Program (WPP)  
Illinois EPA conducts a groundwater protection program with a mission of restoring, protecting, and enhancing the state’s groundwater as a natural and public resource.  The prog ram derives much of its 
authority from the Illinois Groundwater Protection Act (IGPA) that emphasizes a prevention- oriented 
process.  The IGPA is a comprehensive law that relies on a state and local partnership.  Though the IGPA is directed toward protecti on of groundwater as a natural and public resource, special provisions target 
drinking water wells.  
 Wetland Monitoring  
Currently, Illinois EPA neither monitors environmental conditions nor assesses attainment of uses in wetlands.  With the help of other g overnment agencies and interested stakeholders, Illinois EPA has 
begun and will continue to address how to include wetlands in Illinois water quality management.  Inclusion of wetlands represents progress toward the ultimate goal of resource management for all 
surface water types in Illinois.  Recently, Illinois EPA coordinated the creation of an Illinois Wetland Technical Working Group that comprises natural resource professionals and stakeholders with diverse public and private interests.  This wetland work group will address (a) how to define the beneficial  uses 
of Illinois wetlands; (b) how to monitor wetland resources to assess if such uses are being attained; (c) how to identify causes of non- attainment; and (d) how to track wetland resource conditions  through 
time.  
 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  
 Coastal Management Program (CMP)  
The Coastal NPS Pollution Control Program (Section 6217) addresses NPS pollution problems in coastal waters.  Section 6217 requires state with approved Coastal Zone Mana gement Programs to develop 
Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Programs.  In its program, a state describes how it will implement NPS pollution controls, known as management measures, that conform with those described in guidance specifying management measu res for sources of NPS in coast waters.  This program is 
administered jointly between U.S. EPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA).  The Illinois Department of Natural Resources has taken the lead at the state level to implement this guidance.

 Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG)  
The Conservation Innovation Grant program (CIG) is a voluntary program intended to stimulate 
the d evelopment and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies while 
leveraging Federal investment in environmental enhancement and protection, in conjunction 
with agricultural production.  Under CIG, Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) funds are used to award competitive grants to non -Federal governmental or non -governmental 
organizations, Tribes, or individuals.  
 CIG enables NRCS to work with other public and private entities to accelerate technology transfer and adoption of promising technologies and approaches to address some of the Nation’s most pressing natural resource concerns.  CIG will benefit agricultural producers by providing more options for environmental enhancement and compliance with Federal, State, and local regu lations.  The NRCS administers CIG.  The CIG requires a 50 -50 match between the 
agency and the applicant.  
 Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)  
The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) is a voluntary conservation program that encourages producers to address resource concerns in a comprehensive manner by:  
Undertaking additional conservation activities; and  
Improving, maintaining, and managing existing conservation activities.  
 
CSP is available on Tribal and private agricultural lands and non -industrial p rivate forest land.  
The program provides equitable access to all producers, regardless of operation size, crops 
produced, or geographic location.  
 Through CSP, NRCS will provide financial and technical assistance to eligible producers to conserve and enha nce soil, water, air, and related natural resources on their land.  Eligible lands 
include cropland, grassland, prairie land, improved pastureland, non- industrial private forest 
lands, agricultural land under the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe, and other private agricultural land (including cropped woodland, marshes, and agricultural land used for the production of livestock) on which resource concerns related to agricultural production could be address ed.  
 89 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 The entire agricultural operation must be enrolled and must include all agricultural land that will 
be under the applicant’s control for the term of the proposed contract that is operated substantially separate from other operations.  
 Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative (CCPI) The Cooperativ e Conservation Partnership Initiative (CCPI) is a voluntary conservation initiative 
that enables the use of certain conservation programs along with resource of eligible partners to provide financial and technical assistance to owners and operators of agri cultural and 
nonindustrial private forest lands.  
 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)  
The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) is a voluntary conservation program that 
provides financial assistance to individuals/entities to address s oil, water, air, plant, animal, and 
other related natural resource concerns on their land.  Through EQIP, the NRCS provides assistance to agricultural producers in a manner that will address resource concerns, increase environmental benefits, and help part icipants to meet Federal, State, Tribal, and local 
environmental regulations.  EQIP offers financial and technical help to assist participants install or implement structural and management practices on eligible agricultural land and non -
industrial private  forestland.  In addition, applicants can apply for a Conservation Activity Plan 
that best suits their own operation.  
 EQIP is a competitive process.  EQIP applicants compete for funding on a state -wide or area-
wide basis.  A ranking process is used to determine which applications will receive EQIP funding.  The Illinois NRCS has several different EQIP funding pools.  The ranking criteria was developed with input from the Illinois State Technical Committee.   National Water Quality Initiative (NWQI)  
 Throug h the National Water Quality Initiative, eligible producers will invest in voluntary 
conservation practices to help provide cleaner water for their neighbors and communities.  Using funds from EQIP, NRCS will provide financial and technical assistance to p roducers for 
implementing conservation practices such as cover crops, grassed waterways, terraces, and water and sediment control basins in watersheds with impairments where federal investments can make a difference in improving water quality.  
 Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP)  
The Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) is a voluntary program for conservation -minded 
landowners who want to develop and improve wildlife habitat on agricultural land, nonindustrial private forest land, and Indian land . 
 NRCS administers WHIP to provide both technical assistance and up to 75 percent cost -share 
assistance to establish and improve fish and wildlife habitat.  WHIP cost -share agreements 
between NRCS and the participant generally last from one year after the  last conservation 
practice is implemented but no more than 10 years from the date the agreement is signed.

 Easement Programs  
 
Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP)  
The purpose of the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program  is to undertake emergency 
measures, including the purchase of floodplain easements, for runoff retardation and soil erosion prevention to safeguard lives and property from floods, drought, and the products of erosion on any watershed whenever fire, flood or any other natural occurrence is causing or has caused a sudden impairment of the watershed.  
 It is not necessary for a national emergency to be declared for an area to be eligible for 
assistance.  One p rogram objective is to assist sponsors and individu als in implementing 
emergency measures to relieve imminent hazards to life and property created by a natural 
disaster.  Activities include providing financial and technical assistance to remove debris from streams, protect destabilized streambanks, establi sh cover on critically eroding lands, repairing 
conservation practices, and the purchase of floodplain easements.  The program is designed for installation of recovery measures.  
 Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP)  
The Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program (FRPP) provides matching funds to help purchase development rights to keep productive farm and ranchland in agricultural uses.  Working through existing programs ; USDA partners with State, tribal or local governments and non -
governmental organ izations to acquire conservation easements or other interests in land from 
landowners.  USDA provides up to 50 percent of the fair market easement value of the conservation easement.  
 To qualify, farmland must: be part of a pending offer from a State, tribe, or local farmland protection program; be privately owned; have a conservation plan for highly erodible land; be large enough to sustain agricultural production’ be accessible to markets for what the land produces; have adequate infrastructure and agricultural support services; and have surrounding parcels of land that can support long -term agricultural production.  
 Grassland Reserve Program (GRP)  
The Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) is a voluntary conservation program that emphasizes support for working grazing operations, enhancement of plant and animal biodiversity, and protection of grassland under threat of conversion to other uses.  
 Participants voluntarily limit future development and cropping uses of the land while retaining the right to conduct common grazing practices and operations related to the production of forage and seeding, subject to certain restrictions during nesting seasons of bird species that are in significant decline or are protected under Federal or State law.  A grazing management plan is required for participants.  
 Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) The Wetlands Reserve Program is a voluntary program offering landowners the opportunity to protect, restore, and enhance wetlands on their property.  NRCS provides technical and financial support to help landowners with their wetland restoration efforts.  The NRCS goal is to achieve 
the greatest wetland functions and values, along with optimum wildlife habitat, on every acre enrolled in the program.  This program offers landowners an opportun ity to establish long -term 
conservation and wildlife practices and protection.  91 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Mississippi River Basin healthy Watershed Initiative (MRBI)  
To improve the health of the Mississippi River Basin, including water quality and wildlife habitat, the 
NRCS is developing the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watershed Initiative (MRBI).  Through this new initiative, NRCS and its partners will help producers in selecting watersheds in the Mississippi River Basin voluntarily implement conservation practices that avoid, c ontrol, and trap nutrient runoff; improve 
wildlife habitat; and maintain agricultural productivity.  
 These improvements will be accomplished through a conservation systems approach to manage and optimize nitrogen and phosphorous within field to minimize runoff and reduce downstream nutrient loading.  NRCS will provide producers assistance with a system of practices that will control soil erosion, 
improve soil quality, and provide wildlife habitat while managing runoff and drainage water for 
improved water q uality.  
 Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)  Administered by USDA Farm Service Agency  
The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a land conversation program administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA).  In exchange for a yearly rental payment, farmers enrolled in the program agree to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that will improve environmental health and quality.  Contracts for land enrolled in CRP are 10 - 15 years in length.  The 
long -term goal of the program is to re -establish valuable land cover to help improve water quality, 
prevent soil erosion, and reduce loss of wildlife habitat.  
 
Illinois Department of Agriculture  
 Conservation Practices Program (CPP)  
The Conservation Practices Program assists land users with sheet and rill erosion exceeding “t” (tolerable soil loss level) or with ephemeral/gully erosion with the construction of conservation practices which helps conserve soil, protect water quality, and reduce flooding.  Practices eligible include No -
Till/Strip -Till, Contour Farming Establishment, Contour Buffer Strip Establishment, Cover Crops, 
Temporary Cover, Critical Area Planting, Filter Strips, Diversion, Grade Stabilization Structures, Grassed Waterways, Pasture and Hayland Planting, Cont our Strip Cropping, Terraces, and Water and Sediment 
Control Basins.     Nutrient Management Program (NMP)  
The Nutrient Management Program provides incentives to eligible land users for nutrient management projects that minimize the transport of nutrient and pollutant load to surface and groundwater.  Projects include soil testing, developing a nutrient management plan and implementing the plan for four 
years.  Soil and Water Conservation Districts prioritize applications while considering geographic 
locati on, watersheds, and soils.   
 Streambank Stabilization and Restoration (SSRP)  
The Streambank Stabilization and Restoration Program (SSRP) has three primary objectives.   
1. Distribute educational materials on the effects of streambank erosion along with the p ractices 
available to stabilize the erosion through SSRP.  
2. Provide funding to construct effective, low -cost practices, such as rock riffles, stream barbs or 
stone toe protection at suitable locations.  
3. Provide technical assistance to landowner interested in stabilizing an eroding streambank.  
 The program provides cost -share funding assistance to qualified Illinois landowners for stabilizing or 
restoring severely eroding streambanks.  92 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
  
Sustainable Agriculture Act (SA)  
The Sustainable Agriculture Act was signed into law in January, 1990.  It called for research, demonstration and educational efforts related to sustainable agriculture systems.  The Sustainable Agriculture (SA) Committee established by the Act, as well as the Governor’s Water Resources and Land Use Priorities Task Force, have both made several recommendations in published reports regarding 
sustainable agriculture.  The Sustainable Agriculture component of the Partners for Conservation Fund supports the following:  
• On-farm research and demonstration g rants  
• Outreach and education grants  
• University Research grants  
 Vegetative Filter Strip Assessment Law  
The Vegetative Filter Strip Assessment Law (35 ILCS 200/10-152), became effective on January 1, 1997.  Under the law, qualifying property used as a vege tative filter strip is eligible to be assessed at a reduced 
rate.  Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) have been given the authority for certifying that a parcel of property meets the requirements for a vegetative filter strip established under the law, for 
determining the size of the vegetative filter strip and for creating a conservation plan for the area 
occupied by the strip.  
 Henry White Experimental Farm  
The Henry White Experimental Farm is located in St. Clair County.  The farm serves as an  outdoor 
laboratory for research into sustainable agriculture, a system of farming that emphasizes profitability and natural resource protection.  In addition to research plots, the farm’s 94 acres contain wetlands, evergreen and deciduous groves, restored  prairie and wildlife habitat.  The University of Illinois 
Cooperative Extension Serve provides leadership and technical support for many research projects.  
 Soil Conservation Transect Survey  
The Soil Conservation Transect Survey provides a snapshot of the  current status of soil conservation 
efforts on agriculture land in Illinois.  Survey results provide data on the presence of conservation practices in each county, as well as an estimate of remaining land treatment needs.  Since 1982, the Conservation Tec hnology Information Center, in cooperation with local SWCDs and the 
NRCS, has conducted an annual survey of tillage practices.  Information on tillage systems and crop residue is collected at more than 49,000 points across the state.  In addition to collec ting information on 
crop residue management and tillage practices, the surveyors also collect data on sheet/rill and 
ephemeral soil erosion.  Data is sent to the Illinois Department of Agriculture to be analyzed.  The 
transect surveys are conducted on a biennial schedule.  
 SWCD Grants-in -Aid 
In Fiscal Year 2011, the Illinois Department of Agriculture distributed over $12.5 million in funds to Illinois’ Soil and Water Conservation Districts for programs aimed at reducing soil loss, enhancing agricultural pro ductivity and protecting water quality.  The SWCDs provide valuable technical assistance 
to rural and urban customers on a variety of natural resource issues, such as soil conservation, water quality protection, nutrient management, wetlands management, fl ood control, soil erosion control at 
urban construction sites, streambank stabilization, land use, and site suitability for various uses and conservation education.

 Farmland Protection  
Illinois Department of Agriculture administers the Illinois’ Farmland Protection Program under the auspices of the Illinoi s Farmland Preservation Act.  The Act requires state agencies to provide written 
notice to the Department of development projects (e.g., highways, airports, facility planning areas, enterprise zones, and wildlife habitat acquisition proposals) that will lead to farmland conversion.  
 Mined Land Reclamation  
As provided by an agreement with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources – Office of Mines and 
Mineral, the Illinois Department of Agriculture reviews coal mining  permit applications to help facilitate 
the reclamation of agricultural land affected by coal mining operations.

 Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP)  
The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP)  is an enhanced version of the USDA 
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).  The CREP Program is a federal, state, and local partnership designed to retire frequently flooded and environmentally sensitive cropland to achieve restoration and long -term protectio n.  In Illinois, landowners implement conservation practices in the eligible CREP 
watershed to reduce sedimentation and nutrients, improve water quality, and to create and enhance critical habitat for fish and wildlife populations.  
 Illinois Urban and Comm unity Forestry Program  
The purpose of the Illinois’ Urban and Community Forestry program is to assist communities and local units of government in the development and growth of local community forestry programs.  Citizens benefit by living in a high qualit y forest management for aesthetic, health, and safety that will provide 
oxygen, air conditioning, pollution reduction, wind breaks, and habitat.

 Chapter  4 – The Section 319 NPS Grant Program  4.0 
The Section 319 NPS grant program (Grant Program) started  out as the keystone for the Program and 
today it still plays an essential role in Illinois in the control of NPS pollution.  Under Section 319 of the 
CWA, those states with approved Programs are eligible to receive federal funds to implement or supplement  NPS initiatives  identified within the approved program .  Since 1990, U.S. EPA has awarded 
Illinois EPA Section 319(h) CWA funds to implement the Grant Program.  The Program , along with 
guidance from U.S. EPA and the CWA , provides the structure for the Gra nt Program in Illinois.  
 At first, financial assistance was used to support , 1) Grant Program administrative , 2) technical support 
and 3) installation of  demonstrative cost-effective BMPs to encourag e the implementation of NPS 
pollution control programs an d projects throughout the state.  To date, the Grant Program has funded 
dozens of  demonstration BMPs in Illinois.  These projects were either traditional BMPs in areas of Illinois 
where they had not been previously applied or were demonstrating innovative BMP technologies and techniques.  Funds were also used for information and outreach efforts to promote the public’s knowledge and awareness of NPS pollution and for the development of tools to support NPS pollution control efforts.  
 Over time, the Grant P rogram has segued from funding individual 
BMP demonstration projects throughout the state to funding the 
development and implementation of WBP, TMDL, and LRS 
implementation plans.  Components of the plans that address NPS pollution control are eligible to receive Grant Program funds , while 
those components that are most effective in achieving and maintaining water quality standards through NPS pollution control are considered a priority.  Tools, such as the Illinois Urban Manual and the Resource Management Mapping System (RMMS) that support the development and implementation of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans are also a priority for the Grant Program funds.  
 Under the base operating program, Illinois EPA employs staff to more fully manage NPS activit ies at the state -wide and watershed –
specific levels by providing a more active role in the assessment of NPS pollution, the development of management strategies, and the 
provision of administrative, technical, and educational assistance.  
 The Grant Program continues to leverage federal, state, and local technical and financial assistance for use in Illinois to maximize NPS pollution control efforts and to realize the associated environmental 
benefits.  In addition, the Grant Program supports Program partners that can enhance existing projects 
and programs by including additional NPS pollution controls.  Open communication with federal, state, and local partners has increased the number of partners implementing NPS pollution control programs and projects across the state.  The outcome of the communication efforts includes; 1) better coordinated efforts in outreach and information activities; 2) more efficient integration and leveraging of technical and financial assistance programs resulting in the installati on of additional BMPs on -the-
ground; and 3) better informed staff to implement NPS pollution control programs and projects.  
  
Now and Then…  
 
Today’s outreach and information 
efforts include Web based programs 
and tools to assist local watershed 
planning efforts to access and 
incorporate the most up -to-date 
information available during the 
planning and implementation process.  
 
NPS outreach and information efforts 
in the 1990s included projects that 
posted billboards and published books 
to introduce NPS pollution to the 
citizens of Illinois.  95 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 It is imperative that the Program remains dynamic and flexible enough to allow continued evolution of 
the Grant program especially  as opportunities to integrate with and leverage other environmental and 
natural resource management programs for increased NPS pollution control.  
 Illinois EPA’s administration of the Grant Program includes the following:  
 Development and update of an app roved state NPS Management Program – In order to be eligible for 
the Section 319(h) financial assistance, Illinois must have a Program that has been approved by U.S. EPA.  U.S. EPA has provided the N
ONPOINT SOURCE PROGRAM AND GRANTS GUIDELINES FOR STATES A ND 
TERRITORIES  (4/ 12/201 3) to states for  use in the development and updates of NPS management 
programs.   The guidance can be found at http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/upload/3 19-guidelines -
fy14.pdf .  The Program was developed per U.S. EPA’s guidance and is scheduled for an update every four 
years with a start  date of September 2013. 
 Identification of Grant Program Priorities – Illinois’ NPS pollution control priorities inclu de actions and 
activities that are most effective and cost efficient in achieving and maintaining water quality standards through NPS pollution control.  Illinois EPA uses the water quality assessment detailed in the 2012 IR  to 
identify watersheds and their waterbodies that have been impaired by NPS pollution.  The development and implementation of WBP, TMDL, and LRS implementation plans for NPS pollution control is an utmost priority; as it is the link between the areas impacted by NPS pollution and the actions and activities needed for those specific waterbodies to attain water quality standards.  In addition to the impaired watersheds and waterbodies, Illinois EPA has identified Priority Waters for Protection that are also el igible under the Grant Program.  The Priority Waters for Protection are listed in Chapter 2.  
 The Grant Program priorities are also directed by the Program as described in Chapter 3.  Illinois EPA uses a five -year rotation system of priority watersheds to condense technical and financi al assistance 
(monitoring, plan development, plan implementation) into smaller geographical areas to accomplish the ultimate goal of delisting waterbody segments from the Section 303(3) list.  The Program uses a five -
year rotation to reach all 51 watershed s within Illinois.  In addition to the priority watersheds for 
planning, plan implementation, and monitoring, Grant Program funds can be used for state -wide efforts 
including outreach and information and capacity building projects; including the developmen t of tools to 
enhance NPS pollution control efforts.  Grant Program priorities may be adapted to take advantage of opportunities to leverage additional technical and financial resources from new initiatives, and updated programs that have potential for add itional NPS pollution control benefits (e.g., coordinated nutrient 
reduction efforts).  
 Program Announcement, Request for Proposals, Application Review and Selection for Funding – Illinois 
EPA will use both static and interactive methods to encourage participation in the Section 319(h) Grant Program.  The Grant Program information is available on Illinois EPA’s Web site throughout the year at http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/wate rshed/nonpoint -source.html
.  In addition, Illinois EPA will 
conduct appropriate outreach to federal, state, and local partners in priority watersheds (see Chapter 3)  
to encourage participation in the control of NPS pollution through plan development, upda tes, 
implementation and BMP tracking.  The Program is also supported by NPS Unit staff as they provide 
technical assistance to stakeholders and  their org anizations.   96 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 On an annual basis, Illinois EPA seeks proposals for projects 
that prevent, eliminate, or  reduce water quality 
impairments caused by NPS pollution.  A Grant Program Request for Proposals and an electronic application, including additional required materials and instructions, are available on the Illinois EPA Web site at 
http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/watershed/nonpoint -
source.html .  Each of these documents is reviewed on an 
annual basis by NPS Unit staff and updates are made as necessary.  
 After the submittal dead line, copies of the applications are 
provided to an established grant review group.  The group includes members of the Illinois EPA NPS Unit, Watershed Management Section, Surface Water Section  and 
representatives from key federal and state departments and agencies.  Reviews are conducted to evaluate the 
projects in terms of a number of established criteria (see box at right).  The criteria were developed to make sure that selected projects meet the requirements of the Program and, as appropriate, other pertinent state and federal Program guidelines.  Upon completion of all reviews, selected projects are incorporated into the Annual Work Plan.  
 Once U.S. EPA provides confirmation of the amount of Section 319(h) funds available, Illinois EPA finalizes its Ann ual Work Plan and submits it to U.S. EPA for award.  The Annual Work Plan includes a 
project matrix which identifies the projects recommended for funding, the project applicant, total project cost, and amount of assistance requested along with the local match proposed.  A project fact sheet for each of the recommended projects is also included in the Annual Work Plan.  The fact sheets 
briefly describe the proposed project and give additional detail regarding the project applicant and 
contact information, th e project location, as appropriate, including watershed, waterbodies and site 
location for BMPs, an implementation schedule, outputs and outcomes to be achieved and the Program milestones that each of the projects will address.   The fact sheets also descri be if the proposed project 
will implement a watershed -based plan, or equivalent; the nature of such implementation; what 
percentage of the load reductions recommend by the plan will be achieved by the project; and what, if anything, beyond the proposed project is intended for the future.   In addition to the projects for 
funding, Illinois EPA identifies the source, schedule, and outcomes and outputs to meet the match requi rement of the Annual Work Plan.   
Grant Program Application Review  
 
Upon receipt, by the application dea dline , 
all Grant Program applications are 
reviewed for completeness, technical 
merit, and adherence to the 1987 
amendments to the CWA, U.S. EPA Section 319(h) program guidance, and Request for 
Proposals criteria.  Applications found to 
be complete will undergo a comprehensive review designed to evaluate the following:  
•Environmental results likely to be 
achieved  
•Relationship to WBP, TMDL, or LRS 
implementation planning efforts  
•Applicant’s prior performance with 
Grant Program  
•Overall effectiveness of the proj ect 
•Project feasibility including ability and 
schedule  
•Local commitment and matching funds  
•Applicant’s capability to administer 
federal grant funds.

 Fiscal and Project Management 4.1  
Upon award of the Annual Work Plan by U.S. EPA, 
Illinois EPA implements appropriate programmatic and financial systems to ensure that the Section 319(h) funds are used consistently with the state’s legal obligations and to maximize environmental 
benefits.  
 
Each Grant Program  recipient enters into a legally 
binding Financial Assistance Agreement (Agreement) that details the project scope of work, schedule, and budget.  Along with the Agreement, the recipient submits 1) an executed Organization Certifications 
and Grant Conditio ns for CWA Section 319(h) 
Financial Assistance Agreement (see box to right) , 2) 
Taxpayer Identification Form , and 3) Federal 
Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Required Reporting Form  to Illinois EPA.  Execution 
of these documents by the recipient  is confirmation 
that they shall follow all appropriate federal and state laws and guidance that are pertinent to the Grant Program.  
 With an executed Agreement and supporting documents in place, the recipient begins implementation of the project scope of work.  
Illinois EPA staff work with the recipient to ensure 
that all work products are submitted and approved before  the recipient moves on to the next stage of 
the project.  Quarterly reporting and a final project report art  required for all Grant Program  projects.  
As the scope of work is implemented;  the recipient 
is allowed to invoice the Illinois EPA for the completed outputs.  Invoices and documentation of expenses and required match are thoroughly  
reviewed before the eligible expenses are reimbursed and match is approved.  Project files, 
including the Agreement, Amendments, work products, invoices, and audits are all kept on file at Illinois EPA.  Subsets of the documentation are also 
on file, as appropriate, with Illinois EPA Fiscal Services and with  the Illinois Central Management 
Services and Office of the Comptroller.  
 Once recipient invoices are approved by Illinois EPA, 
a request for reimbursement from U.S. EPA for the 
documented work is made.  Documentation of required match is supplied to U.S. EPA with the 
request for reimbursement .

 Grant Program Reporting and Tracking – Illinois EPA submits an End of year Report (Report) to U.S. EPA 
annually in September.  The Report details the activities accomplished toward the implementation of 
the Annual Work Plan, the Grant program, and the Program.  The Report includes project details, such as: grant recipient, project milestones and their status, outputs completed, budget amount expended, and estimated pollutant load reductions.  The Report also links the  specific project milestones to the 
Program milestones that the project addresses.  A copy of the final project report for recently completed projects is submitted to U.S. EPA with the Report.  The Report also includes an appendix that 
documents abbreviated information on projects that were completed in the previous fiscal years.  A collection of past year reports can be found at 
http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/watershed/nonpoin t-
source.html . 
 
NPS pollution control projects  implemented in Illinois with Grant Program funds are tracked through 
U.S. EPA’s Grants Reporting and Tracking System (G RTS) Web site 
(http://iaspub.epa.gov/pls/grts/f?p=110:199:1425698992823918  ). 
 Individual BMPs implemented in Illinois with Grant Program funds are tracked geographically through the University of Illinois and Illinois EPA’s Resource Management Mapping Service (RMMS) W eb site 
http://www.rmms.illinois.edu
. 
 
Grant Program Details  4.2 
With Grant Program funding, Illinois EPA has provided assistance to landowners, municipalities, and 
others for the implementation of NPS pollution control projects.  Below is a brief view of the Grant 
Program, for more information on the Grant Program and to review the Request for proposals visit Illinois EPA’s Web site ( http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/financial -assistance/non- point.html
 
 
Eligible Entities  4.3 
Section 319(h) Grant Program funds are available to any entity that has legal status to accept funds from 
the state of Illinois.  This can include: local wate rshed groups; land conservancies or trusts; public and 
private profit and nonprofit organizations and institutions; units of county, municipal, township, and state governments; universities and colleges; park districts and other local land managing agencie s; soil 
and water conservation districts; conservation organizations; and others.  Grant applicants must have the financial ability to initiate the project; pay expenses, and then request reimbursement from the Illinois EPA, while continuing to finance their normal operating expenses.  
 Applicants must have the authority and ability to implement the proposed project, or propose to subcontract portions of the project to the appropriate entities for implementation.  
 
Project Eligibility and Priority  4.4 
The typ es of eligible projects include the implementation of a WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plan; 
development of a WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plan; BMP implementation; information and 
outreach; monitoring; and research.  
 The Section 319(h) Grant Program  prioritizes projects addressing Illinois waters for which NPS pollution 
is a significant cause of water quality impairment.  Assessment information for Illinois’ waterbodies  can 
be found in the 2012 IR . 
 99 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 NPS pollution control projects with the potential t o eliminate such impairments and restore impaired 
waters will rank higher in the review process and receive more favorable consideration than general NPS 
pollution control projects that are not linked to a specific waterbody  or do not address a waterbody ’s 
current impairments.  NPS pollution control projects that are identified within completed WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plans that eliminate impairments and/or restore impaired waters will receive higher consideration than projects submitted without the support of such a plan.  
 Priority will be given to applications that show that the project is to be designed, implemented and monitored to show measureable environmental results such as quantifying water quality improvements, estimating or modeling pollu tant load reductions associated with innovative demonstration projects or 
programs, or documenting social results, ‘such as increased awareness and knowledge or changes in behavior resulting from educational efforts that lead to improved water quality’.  
Project Priority  4.5 
The following are the types of priority projects that Illinois EPA is seeking to support with the Section 319(h) Gant Program.  Also included are general grant guidelines as they apply to the specific types of projects. 
High Priority Pro ject Types  4.51  
Implementation of a WBP  or a  TMDL or LRS implementation plan to address NPS Pollution.   
Implementation activities include installation of BMPs that have been identified for specific critical areas 
by the WBP  or TMDL  or LRS implementation plan; NPS water quality modeling, environmental and social 
indicator monitoring, and outreach activities that are specifically identified in the TMDL implementation plan or WBP.  
 
Development of a WBP to address NPS pollution.  A WBP must include  the minimum elements required 
in U.S. EPA guidance.  These elements are listed as items a. through i. starting on page 18  of the 
guidance at the following U.S. EPA Web site: http://water.e pa.gov/polwaste/nps/upload/319 -
guidelines -fy14.pdf .    
 
The Illinois EPA recognizes the importance of preventing currently unimpaired waters from becoming 
impaired.  Development of WBP for unimpaired or unassessed waters is also eligible for funding.  The se 
plans will also need to follow the U.S. EPA guidance for Watershed -based plans, although slight 
modifications to the requirements are needed.   For additional information on WBP, please refer to the 
Guidance for Developing Watershed Action Plans in Illinois .41 
 
Development of a TMDL, LRS, or TMDL , LRS implementation plan  or SWP  to address NPS pollution .  A 
TMDL is the maximum amount of a specific pollutant loading a waterbody can tolerate and still support all of its intended uses.  The proposed TMDL to be  developed must be related to a 303 (d) listed 
waterbody that is being impaired by NPS pollution.  Visit 
http://www.epa.gov/r5water/wshednps/topic_tmdls.htm  for additional information about  TMDL 
requirements as defined in U.S. EPA guidance.

 Low Priority Project Types  4.52  
Illinois EPA considers projects that address NPS pollution 
control that are not identified in or supported by a WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plan as low priority pr ojects.  
These projects can include BMP implementation, BMP demonstrations, environmental monitoring, social indicator 
monitoring, and outreach efforts that are not yet identified 
for implementation in a WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plan.  
 Individual B MPs, treatment systems or statewide or regional 
outreach efforts are eligible for funding, but will not be prioritized as highly as those projects specifically identified in a WBP, TMDL, or LRS implementation plan.  
 In select cases a complete WBP may not b e necessary and an 
alternative plan may be sufficient to guide watershed project implementation of NPS pollution controls.  Illinois EPA and U.S. EPA will review alternative plans proposed for implementation with Section 319 watershed project funding to en sure the following planning elements are adequately 
addressed:  
• Identification of the causes or sources of NPS 
impairment, water quality problem, or threat to 
unimpaired/high quality waters  
• Watershed project goals(s) and explanation of how 
the proposed proj ect(s) will achieve or make 
advancements towards achieving water quality goals  
• Schedule and milestones to guide project 
implementation  
• Proposed management measures (including a description of operation and maintenance 
requirements) and explanation of how t hese measures will effectively address the NPS 
impairment identified above  
• Water quality results monitoring component, including description of process and measures (e.g., water quality parameters, stream flow metrics, biological indicators) to gauge proje ct 
success  
 
The use of watershed project funding to implement alternative plans containing the above elements may be approved in the following circumstances: 
• When the impairment is not specific to a pollutant 
• When responding to a NPS pollution emergency or  urgent NPS p ublic health risk  
• When protecting assessed unimpaired/high quality waters  
• When addressing an isolated, small -scale water quality problem resulting from one or a few 
sources of pollution  
   
Not Eligible for Section 319(h) Funds:  
 
•Activities that do n ot control, 
prevent, or address NPS pollution  
•Any activities required by mitigation  
•Any activity or project required by 
federal or state law or federal or 
state permit, including activities 
required or anticipated to be 
required by National Pollutant 
Disch arge Elimination System 
(NPDES) regulations, including 
Phase I and Phase II stormwater 
permit requirements;  
•Routine maintenance or repair of 
existing on -site systems, such as 
culvert replacement, street 
sweeping, catch -basin cleaning, 
septic systems;  
•Proje cts to principally protect 
wildlife habitat, control flooding, 
protect infrastructure, or remove 
invasive species;  
•Ineligible activities based on current 
U.S. EPA guidelines for Section 
319(h) grants.  
 101 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Urban BMPs – Eligible or Not? 4.53  
Illinois EPA intends to support as many urban NPS pollution control projects and programs as possible 
through this Grant Program.  However, programmatic limits in regard to activities or projects required 
by federal or state law makes many urban projects and programs ineligible to receive Grant Program funds.  Visit Urban BMPs – Supplement Guidance for Funding Eligibility to review U.S. EPA’s

Application and Submittal Process  4.6 
The deadline for Grant Program application is normally 5:00 p.m. on August 1st.  In the event that August 
1st is a Saturday or Sunday, the deadline becomes 5:00 p.m. on the Friday prior to August 1st.  Illinois EPA 
empl oys an electronic application that is in a format that allows the applicant to download the files, 
enter and save data on their own computer, and return the completed documents, including an original 
signature,  to Illinois EPA  by post, delivery service, or  in person .  
 
The Grant Program application packet is available at Illinois EPA’s Web site at http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/watershed/forms/319 -application.pdf
. 
 
Projec t Length  4.7 
Project length is two years unless otherwise requested and approved.  Costs incurred prior to the 
execution of the Agreement, or after the project period ends are ineligible for reimbursement.  Costs 
incurred prior to the execution of the Agre ement, or after the project period ends are ineligible as 
match unless otherwise approved  by Illinois EPA , prior to Agreement execution.  
 
Project Costs, Reimbursement Requirements, and Match Requirements  4.8 
The Grant Program does not have a set maximum or minimum total project cost or grant amount.  In 
previous program years, Grant Program funded projects have had total project costs that ranged from 
$80,000 to $2,000,000 and Grant program assistance has ranged from $48,000 to $1,200,000.  
 The Grant Program is a reimbursement program.   Grant recipients must perform the work, pay project 
costs, and submit an invoice with supporting documentation before Illinois EPA will reimburse recipients 
for any approved costs.  Illinois EPA will only make reimbursements to the grant recipient and will 
reimburse the grant recipient no more frequently than monthly.  
 The Grant Program funding is 60 percent of the eligible total project cost.  The reminding 40 percent is the responsibility of the recipient and constitutes the  local match.  This local match may include cash 
spent or in- kind services utilized to complete the approved project tasks but cannot be federal funds or 
funds used to match another federal program.  Local match can be provided by the recipient, sub -
contra ctor, or project partners (including state programs, private foundations, landowner , etc.)  Great er 
than 40 percent local match is encouraged . 
   102 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Other Important Information  
• The recipient, or its approved designee, is responsible for the development of designs and 
application for all applicable federal and state permits for all BMPs to be implemented.  The 
design must be stamped  by a certified professional engineer or NRCS staff unless the recipient  
obtains a waiver of this certification requirement from th e Illinois EPA.  The designs must be 
approved by the Illinois EPA NPS Unit prior to the start of BMP construction or implementation.  Costs associated with development of BMP designs are eligible for Section 319(h) grant funds as long as the costs are incurred within the Illinois EPA approved project period and included in the Agreement budget.  
• The recipient, or its approved designee, is responsible for the development and implementation 
of an operation and maintenance plan (O & M Plan) for all the BMPs installed during the project 
period.  This includes BMPs installed with match funds or Section 319(h) funds.  O & M Plans must be approved by the NPS Unit and are for a minimum of ten (10) years starting from the point of BMP implementation, unless otherwise agreed to by Illinois EPA.  
• Project sponsors may subcontract portions of their Section 319(h) grant or local matching funds for technical or other services associated with implementation of the proposed project.  
• The recipient may utilize subcontractors to c omplete project components.  However, any costs 
associated with a subcontract must be approved in writing by Illinois EPA prior to the start of the subcontracted work.  
• All projects will require quarterly reporting and a final project evaluation and report.  
 See Table 17 for a partial list of BMPs that can be used to control NPS pollution .  Inclusion of a BMP, in  
the Program does not equate to automatic eligibility for the Grant Program.  Appropriate practice location and the practice’s ability to provide water quality benefits through NPS pollution control are considered a priority.    The BMPs  are listed in alphabetical order.  The table includes priority for Grant Program funds for NPS 
pollution source.  This is a generic table  that should be used as a starting point for BMPS to consider for 
implementation.  Illinois EPA reviews Grant Program applications to verify that the proposed BMP addresses the  site specific conditions, the  local waterbody segment water quality impairments and the 
identified NPS sourc es.  BMPs that are marked ‘high’ in the table for funding priority may actually 
become a ‘low’ priority if an impairment and appropriate NPS source are not identified in the 2012 IR , or 
more recent version of the Integrated Report.

 Chapter 5 – Federal Consistency Reviews  5.0 
U.S. EPA has provided guidance that the Program should include an identification and review of federal 
land management programs, development projects and financial assistance programs that are or may be inconsistent with the Program.  This chapter was included to address that request.  
 There are at least five  federal entities that own land in Illinois.  According to the 2010 U.S. Cen sus, the 
federal government owns approximately 1. 8 percent of Illinois’ land and water area in Illinois.  This 
equates to roughly 628,000 acres.  This does not take into account individual buildings such as USDA 
Service Centers or U.S. Post Office building s.  Illinois ranks  37
th in the nation for the amount of land 
owned and operated by the federal government.   Figure 25 shows the general location and size of the 
federal land holdings.

 The entities listed in Table 18 will be  
surveyed by the Illinois EPA NPS Unit in 
2014 to determine their compliance with 
the updated Program for the above properties.  In the event that they are not in com pliance, Illinois EPA will work with these 
entities to develop and implement local NPS pollution control efforts.  For those areas that do not comply with the Program, Illinois EPA will request assistance from U.S. 
EPA as appropriate.  
Federal Development P rojects and 
Financial Assistance Programs  5.1 
Section 319 of the CWA requires that the 
Program identify federal financial assistance 
programs and federal development 
projects, which the state will review for their effect on water quality and their consiste ncy with the Program.  Illinois 
currently has a federal consistency review process pursuant to Executive Order 12372; a clearinghouse has been established and a single point of contact identified.  Development plans for federally assisted projects, as iden tified by an asterisk in the 
list below, are distributed to the State’s clearinghouse and subsequently forwarded to the Illinois EPA for review and comment in accordance with the state’s project notification and review system.  The Illinois 
EPA reviews oth er programs (identified below) for consistency pursuant to the National Environmental 
Policy Act process and through requests made by cooperating agencies/organizations to review draft program proposals (i.e., FSA, U.S. EPA).  
 
Frequently, federal agencies and the Illinois EPA will meet to discuss their particular agency initiatives 
and determine where mutual partnerships can be formed on a formal or informal basis.  Those federal 
agencies where we have most frequently coordinated efforts have been with U.S.  Department of 
Agriculture, U.S. Army Corp s of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish & Wildlife, and the U.S. 
Department of Defense.  Most of these efforts involve participation in planning committees, site visits, and technical assistance.

 Federal Consistency Review Requirements  5.2 
Section 319(b)(2)(F) requires states to identify federal financial assistance programs and development 
projects, which will be reviewed for their effect on water quality consistent with the Program.  
 
Program Review  
The propose d approach to federal consistency review involves two stages.  The first stage is a 
programmatic review.  This is a state level review that may occur at different frequencies (one -time, 
annually, every three years) depending on the program.  The intent of the programmatic review is to 
answer the question – Does the federal program process have components that satisfy the Program?  
The second stage is review of individual development projects.  
 
Criteria for Programmatic Review  5.21 
Review of the programs wil l be completed using the following criteria:  
 Meets requirements of Section 319 of Federal CWA.  
 Meets the State Water Quality Standards.  
 Is consistent with the implementation schedule and projects identified in the Program.  
 Identifies BMPs or BMP process.  
 Identifies process for on -site application BMPs.  
 Identifies a process for modification of BMPs.  
 Planning for water quality.  
 Criteria for Individual Assistance or Development Project Review  5.22 
To implement state review of federal projects efficiently requ ires the utilization of  a state clearinghouse 
process.  The clearinghouse routes the project to the appropriate state agencies for review.  Generic 
criteria for federal consistency with the program are listed below.  
 
Federal Consistency Checklist for Planned Projects  5.23: 
1. Which NPS activities included in the Program are within the project area?  
2. Are state approved BMPs for each NPS control activity included?  
3. For NPS control activities that do not have approved BMPs, are conservation practices identified 
that demonstrate a knowledgeable and reasonable effort to minimize resulting water quality 
impacts?  
4. What process (including feedback from water quality monitoring) exists for modifying the approved or specialized conservation practices in order to protect ben eficial uses of water?  
5. What is the appropriate beneficial use of water for the waterbodies in the project area?  
6. Is the project consistent with the prioritization of watersheds as identified in the Program?  
7. Have the water quality standards and criteria appl icable to protecting the beneficial uses been 
identified?  
8. Does pre -project planning and design include an analysis of water quality resulting from 
implementation of the proposed activity sufficient to predict exceedance of water quality criteria for the ap propriate beneficial uses(s)?  Or in the absence of such criteria, sufficient to 
predict the potential for beneficial use impairment?   111 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Procedures and mechanisms for reviewing federal assistance programs already exist at the state level.  
These include the state clearinghouse and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) environmental assessment/environmental impact statement (EA/EIS) process.  The success of the review process will depend on the ability of the federal and state agency involved to work co operatively to resolve any 
conflicts.  
 The 1990 Farm Bill created a team in each state called the State Technical Committee.  This committee serves as an advisory group to the USDA NRCS State Conservationist on technical aspects of the conservation provisi ons of the farm bills.  Additionally, the NRCS and Illinois EPA continue 
communications to provide technical assistance in resource planning and facilitate the integration of 
NRCS programs into the Program.  
 
Specific federal assistance programs and develop ment projects that are reviewed by the state for 
consistency with the Program are as follows:  
 
∗ 10.069  Conservation Reserve program  
∗ 10.072  Wetlands Reserve Program  
∗ 10.902  Soil and Water Conservation  
∗ 10.904  Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention  
∗ 10.912  Environmental Quality Incentive Program  
∗ 10.914  Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program  
∗ 10.920  Grassland Reserve Program  
∗ 10.921  Conservation Security Program  
∗ 10.924  Conservation Stewardship Program  
 
  112 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Chapter 6 – Feedback Loop  6.0 
The key to a successful long -term Program is to monitor and evaluate it during its implementation.  The 
application of the lessons learned through the evaluation must also occur in order to keep the Program 
up to date, especially in the area of the resources needed to implement it.  
 To e nsure the success of the Program, Illinois EPA will use a combination of tools to monitor and 
evaluate.  The information gathered will be applied to the Program to keep it current, efficient and as effective as possible.  As appropriate, Illinois EPA will also update the Program in response to major changes in resource availability, program, and policy changes, and per guidance from U.S. EPA or the federal CWA.  
Every Four Years  6.1 
Illinois EPA will conduct a comprehensive evaluation to the Program on a four year schedule.  The comprehensive evaluation of the Program will be scheduled to occur after the release of the Illinois Integrated Water Quality  Report  and Section 303(d) List, which is released every two years (e.g., 201 4, 
2016 ).   
 Throughout the life  of the Program, Illinois EPA may also conduct additional evaluations of the Program 
in response to changes in Agency resource availability and program functionality or per guidance from U.S. EPA or the federal CWA.  
 During the comprehensive evaluation, th e Program will be available for review and comments by our 
Partners (see Chapter 3 for a list of Partners).  Illinois EPA will ensure that the evaluation will:  
 
• Re-appraise the Program’s mission and goals;  
• Include a gap analysis and will address how to res olve the gaps that are identified ; 
• Update the identification of watersheds and waters impaired by NPS pollution, and Priority Waters for Protection  (scheduled to happen every two years) ; 
• As necessary, update information for watersheds, land use, and source s of NPS pollution; 
• Attend to the Program implementation components, including monitoring, partnerships, capacity building, plan development and implementation, and outreach activities.  Environmental, social, and administrative factors will be used to ass ess Program 
implementation;  
• Review federal, state, and local laws to determine the extent that they are relevant to the Program and update as appropriate;  
• Document progress toward the stated short and medium -term objectives and milestones, and 
revise these items, as appropriate;  
• Review the BMP tables and update as needed;  
• Assess the implementation of the Section 319 grant program including its efficiency and 
effectiveness, plus the necessary financial management (e.g., internal audit of financial practices 
of the Program including sub- recipient single audit act and reimbursement tracking and U.S. EPA 
grant fund internal review), and identify recommendations for improvement;  
• Update identification of federal programs and partners not consistent with the Progra m; and  
• Assess the Feedback Loop, including tools and processes used, and identify recommendations for improvement.  113 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Each time the Program is updated it will be formally 
announced through the Illinois EPA Bureau of Water Annual Hearing.  There will be a 30 -day comment period after the 
hearing has been held.  This approach will allow Illinois EPA to collect comments from the Program Partners and the citizens of Illinois.  Once the comment period has ended, Illinois EPA will finalize  the Program and submit it to U.S. 
EPA for approval.  Upon approval from U.S. EPA, Illinois EPA will commence use of the new Program to guide the state NPS control activities.  In the event that the approval is 
delayed, Illinois EPA will continue to implement the existing 
Program un til the new Program is approved by U.S. EPA.  
Illinois EPA will endeavor to have updates to U.S. EPA so that approvals will be in place prior to the end of the federal fiscal year.    
 Illinois EPA will work with Program partners, including Grant Program re cipients to include social indicator components 
in programs and projects, as appropriate, and to track and relay the gathered social indicator information regarding NPS pollution control back to U.S. EPA.  
Every Two Years  6.2 
Starting in 2012, Illinois EPA will conduct a statewide biennial  NPS Management Meeting for Program partners 
and general stakeholders to share knowledge on NPS control issues, programs, projects, and practices.  The workshop is an opportunity to bring together NPS pollution control expe rts, watershed associations, 
environmental advocates, and lay persons to provide information about the Program and NPS pollution control to them while also collecting feedback on the Program as well.  Additional information regarding the statewide b iennial  NPS Management Workshop is located in Chapter 3.  
 The Illinois EPA will continue to submit updated IRs, including the NPS assessment, to U.S. EPA. 
Every Year  6.3 
Illinois EPA will conduct a gap analysis on the objectives and milestones listed in Chapter 7 of the 
Program every year.  The results of the analysis will be submitted to U.S. EPA with the End -of-Year 
Report which documents Illinois EPA’s Annual Work Plan achievements.  The information gathered 
through the annual gap analysis will be used to help tailor the subsequent year’s Annual Work Plan.  
 Measures of progress will be captured under the following water quality and implementation categories:  
 
1. Water quality improvement from NPS control  
2. NPS pollution load reduction  
3. Implementation of NPS controls  
4. Public education, awareness, and actions  
5. Development of WBP, TMDL, LRS implementation plans  
 
Measures of Progress  
List of appropriate measures that can be used:  
 
•Waterbody assessment attainment 
(305(b) and 303(d))  
•Number of WBPs developed  
•Number of TMDLs and LRSs 
developed  
•Number of BMPs 
installed/implemented  
•Reduction in pollut ant load  
•Number of meetings held  
•Number of dollars leveraged by Section 319 program  
•Waterbody segments removed from 
impaired list  
•Increase in number of monitoring stations  
•Increase in partners  
•Increase in Clean Watershed Needs Survey documentation  
•Number o f projects with social 
indicator component  
 114 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 In addition, Illinois EPA will work with Program partners to document efforts accomplished and the 
remaining gaps that need to be addressed toward the completion of  WBP, TMDL, and LRS 
implementation plans.  The final result will be a uniform tracking system for partners to use to document their plan objectives and milestones, in terms of need and status.  With that information, Illinois EPA will be better able to coo rdinate Program efforts to assist those groups with documented 
needs.  The information gathered will also, as allowed, be incorporated into Illinois EPA’s NPS portion of the Clean Watersheds Needs Survey.  
 As proposed in Chapter 4,  Illinois EPA and U.S. E PA should 
meet at least once a year to discuss (i) Illinois’ NPS 
environmental accomplishments and remaining  problems , 
(ii) the Program and needs for adjustment or evolution, (III) 
overall progress towards the vision of the national NPS program, and the technical assistance needs for the upcoming year.  The Program should be discussed in the context of the overall environmental needs and goals of Illinois.    Additional opportunities to gain feedback will be pursued throughout the life of the Program.  Entities such as the NRCS facilitated State Technical Advisory Committee and the Rivers of Illinois  Coordinating Council meet regularly 
and their mission includes many components of the Program.  In addition, implementation of capacity building activities, suc h as workshops and webinars, are a prime 
activity to secure additional feedback information.  In -
house training and managers’ meetings are another potential source for information to improve the Program.  
 In September 2011, the draft 2011 Illinois NPS Mana gement Program (version 1.1) was presented at the 
Illinois EPA, Bureau of Water Annual Hearing.  The Program is now part of the permanent record and is posted on the Illinois EPA Web site.  The annual hearing process includes a verbal comment period during  the hearing and 30 -day written comment starting at the conclusion of the hearing.  Comments 
and questions received during the hearing or within the 30 -day public comment period were  included, 
and addressed, as appropriate, in the responsiveness summary created for the hearing.  In addition to the 30 -day comment period, the Watershed Management Section accepted  comments on the draft 
Program through June 30, 2012.  
 The Program will be included annually in the Bureau of Water’s Annual Hearing.  This strategy will insure a minimum 30 -day review process for public comment every year.  In years, where significant changes 
are made to the Program, Illinois EPA will consider implementation of a longer comment period - outside 
of the hearing process.   This process wil l also give Illinois EPA an official annual update to the Program; 
with U.S. EPA approving those updates on a four  year basis as described in Section 6.1.   
Tracking and Mapping Tools  
 
Illinois EPA tracks specific project 
accomplishments through GRTS.  
This information is available to U.S. EPA on a daily basis.  
 
Illinois EPA and its partners also 
track Program accom plishments 
using the RMMS.  Efforts are being 
made to capture additional 
information that can be used for 
implementation plan tracking that 
can be used by federal, state, and 
local partners and the general 
public as well.  
 115 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Chapter 7 – Short - and Medium- Term Objectives and Milestones  7.0 
For Illinois to use this Program as  an effective road map for NPS pollution control, it needs to have 
specific ‘destinations’ and a schedule to reach those points.  This chapter includes the short - and 
medium -term objectives and corresponding milestones for the Program.  The objectives have  been 
developed to demonstrate reasonable progress that leads to accomplishment of the Program’s long -
term goals.  The goals will be attained through environmental, social, and administrative activities.  The 
short -term objectives are projected to be attai ned within one to three years, while the medium -term 
objectives are projected to be attained within three to five years.  The long -term objectives for the 
Program are discussed elsewhere in the Program, principally in Chapters 1 and 3, with a few additional objectives in other chapters as appropriate.  
 The list of short- and medium -objectives and their milestones, including an implementation schedule, 
within a single table will help Illinois EPA and its NPS partners to understand, implement, and evaluate 
the work needed for a successful Program.  With these details, Program partners will also be better able 
to expand these activities into their existing programs that would not normally include components for NPS pollution control.  
 Table 19 – Program Short - and Medium -Term Objectives and Milestones  has been designed by Illinois  
EPA to track objective and milestone attainment for internal use and for inclusion in work plans and 
reporting to U.S. EPA.  As discussed in Ch apter 3, 4, and 6,  Illinois’ Annual Work Plan will reflect the 
appropriate portion of the Program’s objectives and milestones to be implemented.  Chapters 4 and 6  
have additional details regarding Program reporting to U.S. EPA.  
 
The format of the table wil l also be used by Illinois EPA to conduct a comprehensive Program evaluation 
every four years.  In addition to the comprehensive Program evaluation, Illinois EPA will conduct a semi -
formal ‘gap analysis’ annually on the Program’s goals, objectives, and mil estones.  This will allow Illinois

I1 Consistent with the NPS Program the 
Conservation Practices Program (CPP), 
Sustainable Agriculture (SA) Grant Program and Streambank Stabilization and Restoration 
Program (SSRP) administered by the IDA has 
been instrumental regarding BMP implementation for the improvement of water quality through the reduction of soil erosion and sedimentation throughout the State.   Illinois will 
maintain 2010 funding levels. 2010 levels: CPP - 
1.8M; SA - 275,000; SSRP - $475,000  
  
  CONSTRUCTION/URBAN/STORMWATER -Develop statewide programs and projects that are designed to inform and 
educate community planners and decision makers, developers, local, state and federal officials, and citizens of 
urban and urbanizing areas about the impacts of stormwater on local water quality and BMPs to reduce stormwater 
runoff.  Included in these programs and projects, technical and/or fin ancial assistance to promote, design, 
implement, and maintain the BMPs identified to reduce stormwater runoff.  
J1 The Illinois EPA, in cooperation with AISWCD, 
will update and maintain The Illinois Urban 
Manual (IUM) technical guide for use in Illinois 
EPA’s wastewater construction permit 
applications, and as general guidance in the 
design of urban nonpoint runoff controls.  
Internet access of designs will continue to be 
available and updated.

 Previous Program Review and Gap Identification  8.2 
 
Illinois’ Nonpoint Source Management Program (Program) is the road map Illinois follows to prevent and abate NPS pollution impairment of Illinois’’ surface and groundwater resources.  In order for Illinois EPA and its partners to attain the mission and goals identified in Chapter 1 a comprehensive yet p ractical 
Program must be developed and implemented.  Over the past five years, work has been done to review 
and update the 2001 Program; however, the update was never finalized.  Meanwhile, Illinois EPA and its 
partners have continued to implement the July  2001 version of the Program.  
 The U.S. EPA has requested that Illinois EPA include a ‘gap analysis’ as part of the 2013 update of the 
Program.  This appendix was written to address that request and therefore includes a brief description of: 
1. The 2001 Progr am, 
2. U.S. EPA’s Nine Key Elements provided in the recommendations to states for revisions of NPS Management Programs, and  
3. The location and how Illinois has addressed U.S. EPA’s Nine Key Elements within the 201 3 
Program.  
 
Illinois Nonpoint Source Management Program – 2001  
 
The 2001 Program was developed to provide an overview of program initiatives that could be utilized to address water resource problems caused by NPS pollution.  The Program provided an effective statewide plan of action for the abatement an d prevention of water quality impairments ensuing from 
NPS pollution and satisfied the informational and procedural requirements of a state NPS management program as stipulated under Section 319 of the CWA and associated federal guidance.  These informatio nal and procedural requirements included:  
 
1. Identification of BMPs and measures that will be used to reduce pollutant loads upon the state’s surface and groundwater resources;  
2. Identification of programs to achieve implementation of BMPs;  
3. Identification of goals to guide the implementation of BMPs and NPS control programs’  
4. Certification that the laws of the state of Illinois provide adequate authority to implement the NPS management program;  
5. Identification of financial assistance programs, which will support the implementation of BMPs 
and NPS control programs; and  
6. Identification of federal assistance programs and development projects that state will review for 
their effect on water quality.  
 
The primary objective for the 2001 Program:  Continue the reduction o f NPS pollution in Illinois so that 
the attainment of Illinois Water Quality management Plan policies and recommendations can be 
realized .  128 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 Primary goals established for the 2001 Program to reach this objective were:  
 
1. Expand, update, and/or create state implementation and research programs within current 
budgetary constraints, which will better serve to protect the state’s water resources from NPS pollution (i.e., to reduce the number of lake acres, stream miles, and groundwater having use impairments caused by NPS pollution);  
2. Continue the statewide mechanism and process that enables state agencies and organizations, as a collective group, to equitably prioritize NPS pollution control projects for funding, which may become available from local, state, and/or federal sources;  
3. Continue the incorporation of ‘improved water quality’ as a priority objective in all NPS pollution reduction programs; and  
4. Increase the public’s awareness and involvement in local NPS initiatives to serve as a catalyst for federal and st ate involvement at the local level.  
 The 2001 Program provided a(n):  
• Brief discussion of statewide authorities that give the Illinois EPA the responsibility to develop 
and implement Illinois’ Program,  
• Summary of results of the states NPS assessment,  
• Summar y of the NPS reduction programs,  
• Summary of BMPs,  
• Outline of goals and objectives regarding significant NPS initiatives,  
• Description of the ‘process’ or ‘mechanism’ which Illinois used to prioritize and fund future projects, and  
• Identification of federal p rograms that the Illinois EPA reviewed for consistency with statewide 
NPS goals and objectives.  
 
To accomplish the recommendations of the Program, the Illinois EPA developed Annual Work Plans that 
identified specific planning and implementation projects, associated BMPs to reduce NPS pollution, NPS 
pollution control demonstration projects and educational programs along with a schedule for their implementation over a two -year period.  Progress in satisfying the milestones and objectives stated in 
the Annual Work Plans was to be evaluated every six months and reported in the ‘State of Illinois Section 319 Biannual Report’.  Specific goals and schedules for the implementation of BMPs were also to be contained in Watershed implementation Plans developed and approved by the Illinois EPA in accordance with the Watershed Management Program.  In addition to the biannual evaluation of Annual Work Plan milestones, the effectiveness of Illinois’ Program was to be assessed based on the Measures and Indicators of Program Success.  Utilizing water quality based indicators and appropriate assessment data, the Illinois EPA could determine if satisfactory progress was being  achieved and make Program 
adjustments as necessary.  Furthermore, progress on the achievement of Program  recommendations 
related to groundwater protection would be  described in the ‘ Illinois  Groundwater Protection Program – 
Biennial Comprehensive Status and Self -Assessment Report’ prepared by the Interagency Coordinating 
Committee on Groundwater.  This report provided a detailed discussion of the nature, schedule, and status of specific activities that were implemented to reduce groundwater co ntamination from NPS 
pollution.   129 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 In establishing the 2001 Program and preparing Annual Work Plans, the Illinois EPA al so considered 
input from federal, state, and local agencies, as well as from the general public.  Prior to formal 
adoption, proposed revisions to the Program were made available for review and comment through a public hearing.  The Illinois EPA invited participation in the hearing process from all interested and affected parties, including federal, state, and local agencies; the business community; not -for-profit and 
environmental organizations; and individuals.  The input generated through t he public revie w process 
was considered as the Program was finalized.  
 Updates and revisions to the Program were to be made in accordance with state and federal program changes and as needed to assure that it comprehensively addresses the initiatives that would be utilized 
to address water resource problems.  
 
2001 Program Review/Gap Analysis  
The 2001 Program has served its purpose; the Program needs to be updated and refined to set the 
future course for NPS pollution control activities in Illinois.   Illinois has shifted i ts focus away from 
implementing individual demonstration projects in favor of watershed - and community -based NPS 
pollution control programs.  Technology has vastly improved not only in the area of BMPs but also in the area of monitoring, modeling, and outr each.  The 2001 Program included a total of almost 240 
milestones.  With so many milestones, effective project prioritization and focus was difficult.  In 
addition, the resources available at the federal, state, and local level have been drastically impact ed by 
the national economic downturn and partner’s program priorities reflect this impact.  The Program 
needs to be revised to better reflect the current programs and resources available.  Finally, a significant amount of additional detail was necessary to  fulfill U.S. EPA’s recommended Nine Key Elements and to 
make this a dynamic and effective Program to control NPS pollution to achieve and maintain beneficial uses of surface and groundwater in Illinois.  
 U.S. EPA – Region 5 requested Illinois EPA to inclu de a ‘gap analysis’ within the 2013 Program to show 
how both the 2001 and 2013 Programs match up to the Nine Key Elements.  U.S. EPA had provided the 
Nine Key Elements within previous guidance for states to use when revising their NPS management programs.  
 Table A1 lists U.S. EPA’s Nine Key Elements, shows an overall rating for the 2001 Program, and shows 
the chapters within the 2013 Program that address the Nine Key Elements.  Note – the overall rating for 
the 2001 Program is focused on the time period of FY 2001 through FY 2010.   130 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013

Key Elements – Bridging the Gaps  
The essential portions of the 2001 Program will be retained within the 2013  Program, although it may be 
presented in different sections or in different formats.  However, the Program has been significantly re -
written and reformatted to address the gaps that have been identified in the 2001 Program.  The gap 
analysis has helped prioritize ar eas of the Program that need considerable work to make it an effective 
tool to control and abate NPS pollution in Illinois.  We recognize that all areas of the Program, even those rated ‘good’ in Table 20, need to be updated to create a well -integrated pro gram that will achieve 
and maintain beneficial uses of our surface and groundwater resources.  The updated report also captures information that documents the significant amount of adaptive management that was practiced during the implementation of the 200 1 Program over the last ten years by both Illinois EPA 
and our partners.  Even though the 2013 Program will be much more tailored to the current situation 
and includes the Nine Key Elements recommended by U.S. EPA, Illinois plans to continue use of adaptiv e 
management to reach the goals and objectives identified in Chapter 1.  
 
1. Explicit short - and long -term goals, objectives, and strategies to protect surface and 
groundwater.  – The Program was revised in 2001 to address a significant implementation 
dilemma.   The original Program as written did not allow Illinois EPA to support many of the NPS 
pollution control project proposals that were being submitted for financial assistance through 131 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 the Section 319 grant program.  The Program originally focused on support  of demonstrative 
BMP projects and included goals and milestones that could not respond to changes in 
technology, social, and economic trends.  Many progressive NPS pollution control projects could not be included in the Annual Work Plan because the Progra m was written too specifically and 
did not identify the project or activity as a goal, objective, or milestone.  In an effort to solve that problem, the Program was rewritten to accommodate new projects and practices as they were developed.  The 2001 Progr am included almost 240 general objectives and milestones to 
be accomplished to control NPS pollution.  These objectives and milestones were written in language generous enough to accommodate virtually anything from a single demonstrative BMP up to multi -county cost -share programs for implementing a variety of BMPs and outreach and 
education efforts.  The original goals depended upon federal, state, and local partners to voluntarily implement the activities and programs identified.  Now, as we try to documen t 
accomplishments, the generous nature of the objectives and milestones cause difficulties when trying to show success and completion.  We have determined that the Program needs to be re -
focused to get the Illinois EPA staff and partners to strengthen obje ctives, milestones, and 
strategies in specific areas of the state to remove waterbodies from the list of impaired waters.  The review of the existing Program and resultant creation of a new Program will address this problem without allowing Illinois to swing back to the problem of being too specific and not being able to accommodate innovative and effective NPS pollution control projects and programs.  
 
Table 21, located at the end of this chapter , lists all of the milestones reported in the 2001 
Program.  T he table includes the original milestone number, the task, status (complete, partially 
complete, or not addressed) and brief explanation of what was done to complete or partially complete the milestone.  
 
2. Strong working partnerships and collaboration with a ppropriate state, interstate, Tribal, 
regional, and local entities (including conservation districts), private sector groups, citizen groups, and federal agencies. – Illinois has a strong group of federal, state, and local partners all 
working to control N PS pollution in Illinois.  However, the economic downturn at the federal, 
state, and local level has had a significant impact on our Program partners and the resources that they have had available to invest to control NPS pollution.  More formal partner in teraction 
will allow Illinois to better coordinate existing and future programs to control NPS pollution as cost-efficiently as possible and to prevent areas not yet impacted from becoming impaired.  This 
reinforces the need to work in smaller areas on more specific local NPS issues.  The 2013 Program will enlist a new format to better document the efforts and activities conducted by Illinois EPA and its partners to support the Program.  The Program will include components that focus NPS pollution control e fforts in areas where a water quality impairment caused by NPS 
pollution exists or in areas that are considered Priority Water for Protection, which may be impaired in the future.  These components will allow Illinois EPA and its partners to target program s and policies to specific areas so that the local community can see an improvement in 
their local water quality.  The 2013 Program also include s a state -wide approach to keep NPS 
pollution control as a priority for our partners and stakeholders and will help protect areas of concern.  
3. A balanced approach that emphasizes both state -wide NPS programs and on -the-ground 
management of individual watersheds where waters are impaired or threatened.  The 2001 Program included implementation at the state and watersh ed level.  The 2013 Program include s 
a strategy to target watersheds and waterbodies within watersheds to focus the NPS pollution control in areas impacted by sources of NPS pollution.  A more focused prioritization for WBP, 132 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 TMDL, and LRS implementation plan development will make certain that watersheds with 
waterbodies impaired by sources of NPS pollution are evaluated and specific tasks for outreach and BMP implementation are outlined.  
 
4. The state program (a) abates known water quality impairments resultin g from NPS pollution and 
9b) prevents significant threats to water quality from present and future activities. – Illinois will 
continue to implement programs and projects to address current and future impairments.  Additional focus will be  placed on levera ging programs to accomplish as many of the milestones  
as practicable.  
 
5. An identification of waters and watersheds impaired or threatened by NPS pollution and a process to progressively address these waters.  – Illinois EPA will continue current water quali ty 
monitoring programs and will continue to work with monitoring partners to investigate opportunities to conduct additional monitoring of headwaters to help focus NPS pollution control activities.  Better coordination between Illinois EPA’s Watershed Mana gement Section 
and Surface Water Section and other partners will assist Illinois in documenting water quality improvements achieve through NPS pollution control efforts.  
 
6. The state reviews, upgrades, and implements all program components required by Sectio n 319 
of the CWA, and establishes flexible, targeted, iterative approaches to achieve and maintain beneficial uses of water as expeditiously as practicable. – A strategy in Chapter 4 o utlines 
activities related to this element.  This strategy includes upda tes to the Annual Work Plan and 
End-of-Year Report and an assessment of other tools that can be used to administer the 
Program.  Additional milestones are included in Chapter 7.  
 
7. An identification of federal lands and objectives which are not managed consi stently with state 
program objectives. – Illinois will continue the activities to accomplish this element and has 
included new Program milestones to ensure that this element remains up -to-date.  
 
8. Efficient and effective management and implementation of the state’s NPS program, including 
necessary financial management. – Chapters 3 and 4 include details on the management of the 
Program including financial management.  New milestones have been included in Chapter 7 to 
ensure that this element is accomplished.  
 
9. A feedback loop whereby the state reviews, evaluates, and revises its NPS assessment and its management program at least every 5 years. – This element is being  addressed in Chapter 5 and 
it includes an outline of a feedback loop which includes annual, two - and four -year reviews of 
the Program.  The Annual Work Plan and End -of-Year Report will have a new format and will 
play a vital role in the annual reviews conducted by the state.  Other tools will be developed to ensure that the four -year review captures  any potential gaps and provides the information  
needed to address them in a timely and cost -effective manner.  See Chapter  7 for specific 
milestones to ensure timely reviews, evaluations, and revisions of the Program.  The feedback loop will includ e input  from federal, state, and local partners and from Illinois EPA staff as well.  
 133 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013 
 The Program has undergone a significant evolution and expansion to provide guidance to Illinois EPA 
staff and partners to combat NPS pollution in Illinois.   The Program will co ntinue to guide the Grant 
Program, but also addresses partners and resources that significantly supplement the Grant Program.  A combination of voluntary and regulatory programs at the local and state -wide level will allow a much 
more effective and yet fle xible Program to be implemented.  The feedback loop schedule will ensure 
that the Program, including BMPs, partners, and strategies are as current as possible.  
 Chapter 7 of this document lists the short - and medium -term objectives with  milestones for the 2013 
Program.  The chapter includes an example of the new annual reporting format that will be used to show the Program accomplishments.  Chapters 4 and 6 include information on the Annual Work Plan 
and End -of-Year Report and how those tools will be used to track and report on the Program  milestones. 
 We believe that the 2013 Program addresses the Nine Key Elements and other guidance provided by 
U.S. EPA for a NPS management program.  Illinois EPA will conduct a gap analysis of the Program milestones annually through the State of Illinois Section 319 End -of-Year Report submitted to U.S. EPA.  
A more thorough gap analysis will be conducted on the entire Program every four  years, see Chapter 6 
for more details.  In addition, the Program will be revised as necessary for situations such as new guidance received from U.S. EPA and other major decisions that impact the Programs’ implementation.  Appropriate milestones are included in Chapter 7 regarding when and how to conduct a gap analysis on the Program.

Also several technical guides have been developed such as the Illinois Urban Manual and the Guidance for Developing Watershed Action Plans in Illinois
1.3 There are many ongoing and completed watershed projects in Illinois.  Multi-agency cooperation should be 
utilized to study the effects of BMP implementation on ground and surface water quality.  Pre-
implementation conditions have been and should continue to be gathered and documented for the purpose 
of accurate evaluation of BMPs applied and their effectiveness.  Land use data is also beneficial in helping field staff to determine the source(s) and cause(s) of pollutants taken from sampling stations and during onsite assessments. Evaluate and establish program directives 
yearly based on progress.Yes The effects of BMP implementation have been evaluated through the Illinois Soil Conservation Transect Survey, Section 319 National Monitoring Program Projects (Waukegan R. (1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2006), Lake Pittsfield (1992, 1994, 1995, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000), Kickapoo Cr.(2006, 2010)), and other special projects such as Brewster Creek Monitoring Project, Evaluation of N Management Practices, & Northeastern Illinois Stream Restoration InventorySections Goals\Objectives\Outcomes Timetable Met?

1.4 The Federal Clean Lakes Program was developed in 1980 to monitor and control in-lake and NPS pollution 
that affect the quality and use of publicly owned lakes.  As of September 1, 1997, the Illinois EPA completed 
administration on thirteen Phase I projects, five Phase II projects, and two Phase III projects with 
administration continuing on three Phase II projects.Program coordination to occur on a yearly 
basis.Yes All Federal Clean Lakes Program projects in Illinois have been completed.  Funding for the Federal CLP was discontinued.
1.5 The Illinois Lake Management Program Act, passed by the state legislature in November 1989, required the 
development of an Administrative Framework Plan to act as a blueprint for expanded inland lake management activities based on four comprehensive objectives:  1) public education, 2) technical assistance, 3) monitoring and research, and 4) financial incentives for local lake management.  A portion of the funding approved under Illinois’ “Conservation 2000” initiative has been dedicated to begin implementation of the comprehensive plan, now better known as the Illinois Clean Lakes Program (ICLP).Continued on an ongoing basis with yearly 
review.Yes State funding has been used to implement monitoring, best management practices, and education through the Illinois Clean Lakes Program (ICLP) as well as the Priority Lake and Watershed Implementation Program (PLWIP) and Lake Education Assistance Program (LEAP).  However, ICLP & PLWIP funding was eliminated in 2010.
1.51 Provide assistance in diagnosing, restoring, and protecting Illinois lakes through Diagnostic/Feasibility 
Studies (Phase I), Long -Term Restoration and Protection Projects (Phase II), and Lake Quality Maintenance 
Programs (LQMP).Continued on an ongoing basis with yearly

1.52 Coordinate Section 319 and state funds to implement restorative and corrective measures to lake 
watersheds consistent with the findings of the diagnostic/feasibility studies performed in the ICLP.Continued on an ongoing basis with yearly 
review.Yes NPS Pollution Control Financial Assistance Program (319) projects have been funded to implement the 314/ICLP funded diagnostic/feasibility study recommendations of at least 15 lakes (Cedar Lake / Carbondale City Reservoir (2004,2009), Charleston Side Channel Reservoir (2003), Lincoln Park Lagoon (2003, 2005, 2008), Governor Bond Lake (2001, 2003, 2005), Highland Silver Lake (2008), Hillsboro Old (2003), Homer Lake (2004), Kinkaid Lake (2004, 2005, 2008, 2010), Lake Carlinville (2005), Lake Paradise (2001), Lake Sedgewick (2005), Lake Vermilion (2003, 2005), Otter Lake (2002, 2007, 2010), Patriot's Pak Lake (2009), Springfield (2003)) 
1.6 Assessments of BMP effectiveness are essential for 1) selecting the most appropriate BMP for a particular 
problem site; 2) projecting the benefits of BMP implementation; 3) ranking BMP alternatives in terms of cost-effectiveness; and 4) determining an optimum BMP program based upon program objectives.  One approach to BMP assessment is the use of mathematical models.Modeling will be utilized when appropriate 
and reviewed/evaluated yearly.Yes Computer modeling for best management practice selection or evaluation is conducted during development of many watershed-based plans and all Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) and implementation plans.  The development of a project prioritization matrix for use by local and county government staff was completed under the DuPage River Salt Creek TMDL Implementation Program project (10-08).  Two National Monitoring programs in Illinois have been completed and one is underway.
1.61 Use modeling when appropriate to provide assistance in the watershed planning process to site-specific areas of concern and for selection of the proper BMPs which will best address the problem in the most cost-
effective mannerModeling will be utilized when appropriate 
and reviewed/evaluated yearly.Yes Computer modeling for best management practice selection or evaluation is conducted during development of many watershed-based plans and all Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) and implementation plans.
1.62 Use modeling when appropriate to show success of BMPs in completed projects towards the reduction of 
pollutants.  Use generated data to support and show statewide achievements toward pollutant reduction and water quality improvement when adequate field assessment and monitoring time is not available.Modeling will be utilized when appropriate 
and reviewed/evaluated yearly.Yes The Region 5 Load Estimation Spreadsheet Model (Microsoft Excel) is used to estimate the pollutant load reduction achieved by all BMPscompleted and funded under Section 319.  BMP specific pollutant load reduction estimates are tracked through the Resource Management Mapping Service.  Project specific pollutant load reductions are tracked through the Grants Reporting and Tracking System (GRTS).  
1.7 Protection/restoration projects designed to address NPS pollution through the implementation of BMPs, 
educational programs, information campaigns, often require funding levels of a magnitude greater than those available to local groups, organizations, municipalities.  It is imperative that sources of funding such as 
Section 319, 104(b)(3) and 314 be made available to assist local entities in carrying out projects which abate

4.6 Illinois law currently requires that preventive measures be taken to reduce spills of contaminants that cause 
water pollution.  Efforts by the Illinois EPA, IDA and agri-business representatives have produced more 
detailed rules and regulations regarding storage, handling, and operational area secondary containment at agrichemical facilities within setback zones, and regulated recharge areas of potable wells (8
 
Illinois 
Administrative Code, Part 255).  Many of the facilities subject to the containment requirements have been operating for the past two decades with minimal spill control provisions.  As a result, some areas where the containment structures are to be placed have become contaminated and are posing a threat to water 
resources.  Limited availability or lack of funds to realize remediation is a major impediment in implementing 
preventative measures.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Yes IDA and Illinois EPA continues to implement the 255 program. 
4.61 Develop initiatives to address preventive measures such as chemical handling, containment, and spill clean-
ups.  Programs may include structural practices, information/education, technical assistance, and development of setback zones.  These initiatives should be available to agri-businesses, landowners and 
operators, and technical assistance groups, such as the local soil and water conservation district, to address

4.10 Since October 1985, the Illinois EPA has conducted a surface water monitoring pesticide subnetwork in 
which 30 streams in Illinois are routinely monitored for commonly used herbicides and insecticides.  Data has been compiled for the first five-year period, which indicates several herbicides are being detected on a regular basis.  Of the samples collected, atrazine, metolachor, alachlor, and cyanazine were the most commonly detected.  The general pattern of detection indicates higher concentrations occurring in the spring and summer, which are likely associated with field applications and subsequent precipitation/runoff events.The efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.

In 2002, USEPA published the A Homeowner’s Guide to Septic Systems, which provides information about septic system maintenance. Illinois EPA continues to make its Lake Notes fact sheet on Septic Systems available online or as a pdf file. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Cooperative Extension Service continues to make publication Septic Systems: Operation and Maintenance of On-Site Sewage Disposal Systems available online.
6.2 The use of pesticides and nutrients can contribute NPS pollutants to receiving waters via stormwater runoff.  
Improper application of these materials in urban areas where increased stormwater runoff occurs can lead 
to water quality degradation.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated 
yearly.Agree This Goal is really a statement of fact and therefore not a measurable goal
6.21 Develop programs and initiatives that evaluate the effects of urban pesticide/nutrient usage on water 
quality and to utilize the collected information to develop pesticide/nutrient management programs and BMPs.  Implement these programs so that stormwater runoff and NPS pollutant loads are reduced.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Yes The Illinois EPA monitors nutrients in surface waters through its Ambient Water Quality Monitoring Network (AWQMN), Ambient Lake Monitoring Program (ALMP), and Illinois Clean Lakes Program Phase I diagnostic/feasibility studies.  Illinois EPA also operates a Pesticide Monitoring Subnetwork (PMN).  Monitoring data is used to identify appropriate pesticide/nutrient management programs and practices in watershed-based plans, Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) and implementation plans, Phase 1 diagnostic/feasibility studies.  Pesticide/nutrient management programs and practices identified in watershed-based plans, Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) and implementation plans, Phase 1 diagnostic/feasibility studies have been implemented with funding under Illinois Clean Lakes Program (ICLP), Priority Lake and Watershed Implementation Program (PLWIP), and NPS Pollution Control Financial Assistance Program (319).

the applicant has taken all reasonable measures to avoid or mitigate negative environmental impacts 
associated with urban runoff that may result from the proposed amendment.Evaluate and establish program directives 
yearly to remain consistent with the WQMP.Yes The Illinois EPA considers whether or not applicants have taken all reasonable measures to avoid or mitigate negative environmental impacts associated with urban runoff that may result from the proposed WQMP amendment.  Assuring that wastewater treatment meets antidegradation criteria and load reductions required by TMDLs occurs during the permitting process.  Since 2001, the NPDES stormwater permit requirements have been expanded to cover a broader range of activities and provide more uniform protection against urban runoff and have largely replaced this objective since the Illinois EPA can readily enforce NPDES stormwater permits whereas there is little opportunity for such enforcement by the Illinois EPA of local ordinances enacted as a condition for approval of an facility planning area modification.
6.5 The use of impervious materials reduces water infiltration, increases stormwater runoff, and increases the 
potential for NPS pollution to impact state water resources.  The long-term protection of state water resources in urban and developing areas will be dependent upon the local communities understanding of the correlation between urban development, stormwater runoff, and water quality deterioration.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Yes Programs used to educate target audiences on the correlation between urban development, stormwater runoff, and water quality deterioration include the Illinois Clean Lakes Program (ICLP) and NPS Pollution Control Financial Assistance Program (319), Illinois Green Infrastructure Grant Program for Stormwater Management (IGIG).

maximum setback zones, have been given priority for review to find sites that may be subject to the technology control regulations (35 IAC 615/616). The sites selected for this round of assessment were only the ones that store fertilizer, pesticides, deicing agents or road oil. These types of sites were selected because the materials stored make them subject to regulation. A summary of this effort can be found in Chapter 5, Section 7 (page 39) of the IGPA Biennial Report, see:  http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/groundwater-protection/2000-2001/groundwater-protection-2000-2001.pdf 
10.55.6 Prioritize evaluation and compliance determinations for activities referred by permit programs. Program coordination to occur on a yearly 
basis.Yes Within the Illinois EPA BOW, the Groundwater Section, Permit Sections and Compliance Section have 
developed standard operating procedures applicable to permitted facilities. The goal is to develop procedures that will provide prompt review of monitoring results and assure continued compliance with groundwater standards. These procedures should reduce the number of facilities that are out of compliance upon permit review and therefore in need of corrective actions.
10.55.7 Integrate the WHPP with vulnerability waiver assessments under the SDWA. Program coordination to occur on a yearly 
basis.Yes The intent of this program is to accelerate the adoption of local recharge area protection programs and 
to assure compliance with the SDWA Phase II, IIb and V monitoring requirements. Monitoring waivers are being used as an incentive mechanism for encouraging the establishment of local source water protection and prevention programs. The progress and participation on this groundwater protection goal has been highlyeffective to date. A summary of this effort can be found on pages 60-61 of the IGPA Biennial Report, see: http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/groundwater-protection/1996-1997/groundwater-protection-1996-1997.pdf
10.56 Continue to implement and improve overall groundwater quality indicators. Program coordination to occur on a yearly 
basis.Yes Illinois EPA worked with the USGS to conduct field observations of samplers and a quality-assurance 
review of our sampling program, including calibration of water quality meters, as part of the USGS National Field Quality-Assurance (blindsample) program. In 2005, field personnel and their equipment were tested with ninety percent of the results satisfactory. Unsatisfactory results were primarily due to older equipment, which has since been replaced. In addition, latex gloves have been incorporated into the sampling procedure based on recommendations from past quality-assurance reviews. As resources allow, it is anticipated that this quality-assurance review will continue.
10.6 The Illinois Groundwater Protection Act establishes a community water supply well site survey program to 
be conducted by the Illinois EPA, which will provide an inventory of potential sources, routes of 
contamination, and activities within established setback zones.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Yes The Illinois EPA completed the wells site survey program durring 1994-95. Approximately 8,500 potential contamination sites are associated with community wells. Many of the sites in our database (CDBS) are not regulated, but because of their proximity to community wells many sites have been recorded, see, http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/surveys-assessments.html
10.61 Inventory all community groundwater supplies in the State for potential sources and routes of 
contamination.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing

10.7 The Illinois Groundwater Protection Act authorizes counties and municipalities, if they so desire, to conduct 
more comprehensive evaluations regarding the need for groundwater protection.  In addition, an equivalent 
program is available to communities of less than 5,000 people or counties of less than 25,000 people, to 
conduct a hazard review to evaluate the level of groundwater protection needed.  These actions help establish coordinated programs between water supply protection and community development.Assistance is an ongoing initiative and will be 
evaluated yearly.Yes The Illinois EPA completed a pilot Groundwater Protection Needs Assessment for the City of Pekin, IL. In 1992.  In addition, three other pilot Groundwater Protection Needs Assessments were completed for Pleasant Valley PWD, the Village of Cary, and the City of Woodstock.  Based on these pilot efforts, a Guidance document for conducting Needs Assessments was published to assist other CWS in these efforts, see: http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/publications/needs-assessment.pdf               An equivant program for smaller CWS are known as Hazard Reviews and are completed by the Illinois EPA upon request.  A total of 7 Hazard Reviews were completed by the 1994 reporting period, see:  http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/groundwater-protection/1992-1993/groundwaterprotection1993v2.pdf also see, http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/surveys-assessments.html
10.71 Provide technical assistance to counties or municipalities that desire to create a groundwater protection 
needs assessment.Assistance is an ongoing initiative and will be 
evaluated yearly.Yes The Illinois EPA completed a pilot Groundwater Protection Needs Assessment for the City of Pekin, IL. In 1992.  In addition, three other pilot Groundwater Protection Needs Assessments were completed for Pleasant Valley PWD, the Village of Cary, and the City of Woodstock.  Based on these pilot efforts, a Guidance document for conducting Needs Assessments was published in 1995 to assist other CWS in these efforts, see: http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/publications/needs-assessment.pdf  
10.72 Sponsor groundwater protection needs assessment workshops. Assistance is an ongoing initiative and will be 
evaluated yearly.Yes The Groundwater Advisory Council sponsored a Policy Forum on Regional Groundwater Protection Programs in April 1994. Illinois EPA also participated in a total of three IRWA training workshops. A summary of the four pilot Groundwater Protection Needs Assessments were presented at these events.
10.73 Use education/awareness programs, such as Illinois Farmasyst, in areas where SWCD/NRCS programs can 
enhance pollution prevention and BMP application through funding, such as CRP and CPP.Assistance is an ongoing initiative and will be 
evaluated yearly.Yes Within the 1996-97 reporting year, a total of seven groundwater protection field days, six Farm-A-Syst pilot demonstrations and two pollution prevention workshops were held in cooporation with the Groundwater Protection planning committees, Several of the theseFarm-A-Syst events were held at participating farmsteads where demonstrations on proper well maintenance, chemical storage, and livestock waste management procedures were highlighted. For more see:  http ://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/groundwater-protection/1996-1997/groundwater-protection-1996-1997.pdf
10.8 The Illinois EPA established a statewide groundwater monitoring network pursuant to P.A. 83-1268.  The network is composed of community water supply wells.  The sampling and analysis program was initiated in 
1985 and includes the first comprehensive analysis for volatile organic chemicals (i.e., solvents), inorganic compounds (i.e., heavy metals), and pesticide compounds.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Yes The Illinois EPA initiated an Ambient Groundwater Monitoring Network in 1992 and includes 353 CWS wells that are sampled for IOC, VOC and SOC.  The wells were  randomly selected with assisstance of the USGS.  The design of this network is described in detail in the 1996 IGPA Biennial Report, see: http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/groundwater-protection/1994-1995/groundwater-protection-1996.pdf also see, http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/ambient-monitoring.html
10.81 Create projects and/or programs that demonstrate groundwater protection through management (including 
sealing) of abandoned wells and improvements to active wells.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Yes With assisstance from the regional groundwater protection planning commmitees, numerous field days and workshops have been held to promote groundwater protection and management programs.  Many of these events included on-site well sealing demonsrtations. The Illinois Association of Groundwater Professionals published the Water Well DisinfectionProcedures Manual in 1997, documenting a number of possible methods of disinfecting wells and advocates utilizing the services of a licensed water well professional in inspecting and correcting problem water wells.  For more on these efforts, see: http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/groundwater-protection/2000-2001/groundwater-protection-2000-2001.pdf
10.82 Create projects and/or programs that help local governments to locate and treat abandoned and 
contaminated wells and to protect present and future water supplies.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Yes Regional Groundwater Committee field day and workshops generally focus on projects and/or programs that help local governments to locate and treat abandoned and contaminated wells and to protect present and future water supplies.  Several committees offer well-sealing assistance programs to provide low-cost well bentonite to private well owners.  In addition, IDNR and Illinois EPA published "Groundwater Protection by Local Government document", see: http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/publications/local-government.html  also see, http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/publications/needs-assessment.pdfSections Goals\Objectives\Outcomes Timetable Met? How Met
10.A For groundwater used by community water supply wells withdrawing water from unconfined aquifers, a 
declining trend or no increases in groundwater exceedences will occur through the year 2005.Year 2005 Partial While overall groundwater quality protection indicators show that the implementation of the IGPA 
continues to be adequate, several recommendations for improvement exist. In particular, develop a strategy to address the increasing trend of VOC contamination in CWS wells. Analyses of groundwater data collected from 1990 to the present shows a statistically significant increasing trend of community water supply wells with volatile organic compound detections per year. More importantly, this data show an increasing trend of groundwater degradation. An analysis of these data show total xylenes and 1,1,1-trichloroethane as the most common VOCs detected.
10.B The percentage of groundwater recharge areas (acres) with protection programs established or under 
development will increase 15 percent between 1995 and the year 2000.From 1995 until 2000 Yes The Illinois EPA has established a goal of increasing the percentage of groundwater recharge areas (acres) 
with protection programs established or under development to a level of 45% by the year 2005. Illinois EPA has made considerable progress in meeting these groundwaterprotection goals through such initiatives as the groundwater standards, Regional Groundwater Protection Planning Programs, and the SDWA Monitoring Waiver Program, see: http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/groundwater/groundwater-protection/1998-1999/groundwater-protection-1998-1999.pdf  
10.C More sites monitoring shallow groundwater units will show improvement than will show degradation by 
2005.Year 2005 Partial Analyses of groundwater data collected from 1990 to the present shows a statistically significant 
increasing trend of community water supply wells with volatile organic compound detections per year. More importantly, this data show an increasing trend of groundwater degradation.
10.D Decreasing trend in significant releases to shallow groundwater at regulated non-LUST facilities over the 
next five years.Year 2006 Partial Coordination between Illinois EPA’s Bureau of Water and Bureau of Land remediation programs continue 
through the establishment of the Groundwater Contamination Response Strategy and Right To Know Law. Illinois EPA’s Bureau of Land Site Remediation Referral Group has been doing additional field work to determine sources of contamination. 
10.E Sign-up of lands in set aside programs will increase with efforts from SWCDs utilizing county maps of 
vulnerable areas created by the Illinois EPA.Ongoing Yes Significant coordination between the Illinois EPA and USDA/NRCS have occurred since the 12th CRP 
signup period (June 15-26, 1992) had 22 CRP bids for wellhead protection  accepted.  With assistance of the IRWA Source Water Technician staff, Illinois EPA has provided GIS coverages of CWS delineated wellhead protection areas to USDA/NRCS to further promote this effort. However, due to confidentiality restrictions we are unable to document the realtive success of this program.
11.0 Wetlands
11.1 Wetlands are a valuable resource in Illinois.  The benefits that they can provide include: flood storage and 
conveyance, sediment control, wildlife habitat, recreation, and water quality improvement.  These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated 
yearly.Yes This is a goal statement.  The value of wetlands is reiterated in the updated NPS Program.  Funding for wetland restoration projects has been made available under Section 319 and IGIG.  To further address this goal, the following milestone is included in the updated NPS Program, "Wetland protection will be incorporated into watershed-based plans.  The NPS components of Illinois EPA-approved watershed-based plans will be incorporated by reference into the NPS Program and implementation of watershed-based plans will be tracked through RMMS."  (E2)
11.11 Develop projects and/or programs that promote better private and public wetland stewardship through 
progressive educational programs, wetland standards and specification guidelines, and financial incentives to owners to continue the protection and creation of wetland acres in Illinois.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Yes The Illinois EPA has provided resources to Section 319 NPS projects to inform and educate the public about the importance of wetlands as it relates to reducing NPS and improve water quality.  Such programs include, Bringing Wetlands to Life (2005), Low Impact Development Techniques in Madison County, Illinois (2007), Roosevelt Park Stormwater BMPs and Education (2009), American Bottom Wetland Interpretive Site & Educational Campaign (2010)  Sections Goals\Objectives\Outcomes Timetable Met?

11.12 Develop voluntary programs that encourage public and private sectors to work together on wetlands to 
meet local community goals through outreach education, monitoring, information, demonstration, technical 
assistance, and positive incentives.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated 
yearly.Partial The Illinois EPA provides Section 319 resources to assist in the administration of the USDA/FSA Conservation Resource Enhancement Program (CREP) (1997, 1999, 2002, 2010) in which one of element is Wetland Reserve Program (WRP).  The objective of the WRP is to protect, restore, and enhance wetlands and their functions on private property through conservation easements and agreements.  The Illinois EPA partnered with other state agencies to develop a comprehensive wetland monitoring and assessment program in 2005 (Wetland Monitoring and Assessment Program for the State of Illinois - 2007).  Funding for wetland restoration projects has been made available under Section 319 and IGIG.  To further address this need, the following milestone is included in the updated NPS Program, "Wetland protection will be incorporated into watershed-based plans.  The NPS components of Illinois EPA-approved watershed-based plans will be incorporated by reference into the NPS Program and implementation of watershed-based plans will be tracked through RMMS."  (E2)
11.13 Develop and implement appropriate programs and/or policies that meet the needs of both the public and 
private sectors regarding wetland creation and protection to improve water quality in Illinois.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Partial Illinois EPA is one of the state agencies who participates in the Agency Action Plan for the Interagency Wetland Policy Act of 1989 which was enacted to ensure that there is no overall net loss in Illinois existing wetland areas.  Funding for wetland restoration projects has been made available under Section 319 and IGIG.  To further address this need, the following milestone is included in the updated NPS Program, "Wetland protection will be incorporated into watershed-based plans.  The NPS components of Illinois EPA-approved watershed-based plans will be incorporated by reference into the NPS Program and implementation of watershed-based plans will be tracked through RMMS."  (E2)
11.14 Develop, gather, and distribute wetland related technical resource information and procedures on the 
protection, management, enhancement, and creation of wetlands in Illinois.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Partial Illinois EPA provided Section 319 funding resources to Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) for the development of an Initial Site Evaluation (ISE) procedure  (2003) used to rapidly evaluate likely success of wetland restoration or creation at proposed wetland compensation sites. 
11.15 Promote voluntary projects and/or programs to increase public awareness of wetlands and their benefits 
through education, demonstrations, and wetland monitoring.  Planning, design, and implementation of BMPs for wetland NPS control projects should be evaluated and compared across a large cross section of restoration sites.  This will allow identification of common characteristics, which contribute to project success, regardless of its geographic location or type.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Partial The Illinois EPA has provided resources to Section 319 projects that have developed educational outreaches to the public to inform and educate the public about the importance of wetlands as it relates to reduce NPS and improve water quality.  Such programs would include, Bringing Wetlands to Life (2005), Low Impact Development Techniques in Madison County, Illinois (2007), Roosevelt Park Stormwater BMPs and Education (2009), American Bottom Wetland Interpretive Site & Educational Campaign (2010) . To further address this need, the following milestone is included in the updated NPS Program, "Wetland protection will be incorporated into watershed-based plans.  The NPS components of Illinois EPA-approved watershed-based plans will be incorporated by reference into the NPS Program and implementation of watershed-based plans will be tracked through RMMS."  (E2)
11.16 Develop projects and/or programs to increase the use of restored and created wetlands as BMPs to protect 
public water supplies through the removal of contaminants (such as heavy metals, nitrates, and phosphates), and to assist in the control of shoreline stabilization and erosion control.These efforts are addressed on an ongoing 
basis and will be reviewed and evaluated yearly.Yes Illinois has provided Section 319 resources to the Governor Bond Lake TMDL Implementation Plan Execution -Phase 1 (2001) and Governor Bond Lake TMDL Implementation Plan Execution -Phase 2 (2003) that constructed  stormwater wetlands to absorb and remove contaminants to protect water supplies customers for the City of Greenville residents.
11.2 State and Federal law require that Illinois EPA actions (i.e., permit and/or loan issuance) be consistent with 
the WQMP.  The WQMP addresses point and NPS pollution sources, maintenance of stream uses and water quality standards, protection of groundwater resources, and control of hydrologic modifications.  Applications to amend the WQMP are required to address both direct and indirect environmental impacts of the proposed revision.Evaluate and establish program directives 
yearly to remain consistent with the WQMP.Yes This Goal is met through application to the Agency for a Permit (new or renewal), Loan or other actions that must be consistent with the WQMP and the Agency's actions with the application.  The Agency will use the Anti-degratdation process, the alternatives analysis and plan reviews to determine constitancy.  Once the action is approved it becomes part of the WQMP through the Annual Bureau of Water Hearing.
11.21 When appropriate, provide conditional approval of WQMP amendment requests upon documentation that 
the applicant has taken all reasonable measures to avoid or mitigate negative environmental impacts associated with urban runoff, which may result from the proposed amendment.Evaluate and establish program directives 
yearly to remain consistent with the WQMP.Yes Although rare this if an applicant has met the reasonable measures conditional approval will be made.  The Agency would prefer to not allow conditional approval and grant the Permit or Loan once all conditions are met.Sections Goals\Objectives\Outcomes Timetable Met? How Met
11.A There will be no overall net loss of wetlands or their functional value from 1997 levels. Ongoing Partial The State of Illinois does not currently track wetland acreage loss .  The lead state agency (Illinois DNR)  
does not track the loss of wetlands in Illinois.  The Illinois EPA is a participating state agency in the Agency Action Plan for the Interagency Wetland Policy Act of 1989 in which the intent of this act is to ensure that there is no overall net loss in Illinois existing wetland acres or their functional values resulting for State-supporting activities.  To further address this need, the updated NPS Program includes the following milestone, "Investigate the possibility of incorporating a statewide wetlands net gain/loss as a data layer to RMMS by 2016." (E1)
11.B A database will be developed to track present and historical BMP implementation (date, type, location, 
effectiveness, etc.) by state and federal agencies in priority areas by the year 2005 and statewide by the 
year 2010.From 2005 until 2010 Yes BMPs implemented through the NPS Pollution Control Financial Assistance Program (319), Illinois Clean Lakes Program (ICLP), Priority Lake and Watershed Implementation Program (PLWIP), and Illinois Green Infrastructure Grant Program for Stormwater Management (IGIG) are tracked through the Resource Management Mapping Service.  BMPs implemented through 319 are also tracked through the Grants Reporting and Tracking System (GRTS).  
11.C The creation of wetlands, utilizing Section 319 funds, for purposes of pollution control, will increase by 10% 
in urban areas.Ongoing Yes Prior to July 2001, a total of 109.53 acres of wetlands were restored and 4 urban stormwater wetlands constructed with funding under the NPS Pollution Control Financial Assistance Program (319).   Since July 
2001, 319 funding has been approved for 625.1 acres of wetland restoration and construction of 32 urban stormwater wetlands.   This represents a 570% increase in wetland restoration and a 800% increase 
in urban stormwater wetland construction with Section 319 funding135 | Illinois NPS Management Program – 9/18/2013
