Eutrophication of rivers & lakes is the major cause of pollution worldwide.
Nitrogen and phosphorus through agricultural effluents and industrial outpour are
the chief cause of eutrophication. In recent years microalgae have been largely
used as test systems for the removal of pollutants from wastewater Codina et al
(1993). Many advanced bioreactors use immobilized microorganisms as
biocatalysts since they reduce cell washout and increase the biocatalyst
concentration with optimum contact with the substrate. Also the use of
immobilized cells instead of free cells offers increased stability and the ease of
separation of algal biomass after waste water treatment.
Immobilization is the process which limits the free migration of cells by
aggregating them to a solid support or entrapping them into a fibrous or porous
material or a membrane. Immobilized cells are being used for various applications
(Scott, 1987). Chief potential uses are for the production of pharmaceuticals and
reagents, biosensors, chemicals, food and beverages. Wastewater treatment is one
of the chief and significant areas of application for immobilized cell processes.
There are reports of nitrification (Lemoine et al 1988) and denitrification
(Vossoughi et al 1982) of wastewater and also phosphate removal (Chevalier and
Noue 1985) have been studied in different organisms. Proulx & de la Noue (1988)
have reported the use of immobilized algae in the removal of nitrate and
phosphate from wastewater. Both natural and synthetic polymers have been
employed for immobilization of the cells. For an immobilized system to be viable
and long lasting there should be no irreversible, structural, physiological or
metabolic damage to the cells. The choice of alginate as a matrix seemed to be
effective as the algae remained metabolically active longer in an immobilized
system Brouers et al (1989).
Due to increasing human population, upcoming industries and agriculture
practices there is an increase in eutrophication of aquatic ecosystem by the release
of chemicals, fertilizers in the aquatic ecosystem. Removal of ions is highly
expensive and energy consuming effort. Use of biological systems serve a cheap

The present study aims to investigate the nitrate, ammonium and
phosphate uptake capacity of the immobilized cells of D. salina.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Stock cultures of Dunaliella salina were raised in 250ml Erlenmeyer flasks
containing 100ml of liquid medium ( Johnson et al 1968). Illumination was
provided by cool white fluorescent light (14 W/m2
) for a light/dark period of
14/10 hrs. The temperature was maintained at 26±1°C and any drop in the pH of
the medium was adjusted by adding sterilized 1N NaOH. A dense homogeneous
100 ml sterile suspension of alga (absorbance at 660nm= 1.0) was mixed with 4%
(w/v) sodium alginate with continuous manual shaking for 20 min. A 10 ml
syringe fitted with a needle of 1mm bore was used for extruding beads of algae
entrapped in alginate dropwise from a height of 10 cm into a beaker having 100
ml of 0.2M calcium chloride. The resulting alginate beads (diameter 2.8 ± 0.11)
were allowed to harden in calcium chloride solution for 30 min. Stabilized beads
were washed 2-3 times with culture medium and finally resuspended into the
basal medium for further growth.
Logarithmic algal cells with same initial cell density (absorbance at 660mn= 1.0)
were divided into two. One part was kept as free and other was immobilized and
grown in 250ml conical flasks in triplicates. At regular intervals the free and
immobilized algae were withdrawn and placed in 10ml of 0.1M trisodium citrate.
The cells were released from the beads after 15 min which was then centrifuged.
Methanol was added and the cells incubated for 48hrs.The suspension was
centrifuged and the clear supernatant was used to estimate chlorophyll a and the
absorbance was noted in a calorimeter (Mackinney, 1941 ).
For dry weight determination the algal cells were harvested by centrifugation by
using a Sorvall RC centrifuge. The cells were washed 2-3 times with Johnsons
medium. 100ml of culture was filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper,
weighed and dried in vacuum oven at 80°C for 24 hrs. Thereafter the final weight
was recorded after cooling. Uptake of phosphate was estimated calorimetrically
by Stannous chloride method (APHA, 1985) & nitrate was determined by brucine
sulphuric acid method ( Nicholas & Nason, 1957) and ammonium was assayed by
Nessler’s reagent ( Herbert et al 1971). Stastistical analysis was done by one way
Analysis of Variance(ANOVA) and means compared using Duncan’s new
multiple range test ( p< 0.05).
71RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Time course effect of growth ( biomass) of free and immobilized cells of D. salina
is depicted in Table 1. After 25 days of cultivation immobilized cells exhibited
71% increased growth rate than free living cells. D. salina in free and
immobilized states. Immobilization could facilitate recycling or regeneration of
cells. Our results agree with the findings of Chevalier and Noue (1986) who
worked with Scenedesmus obliquus for nutrient removal from the wastewater. It
is also possible to achieve higher cell densities with cultures grown in
immobilized cell systems than in free cell suspensions (Mitsui et al 1985).

immobilized cells (I).

followed by different letters are significantly different (p<0.05).
Immobilization offers a unique advantage over free cells due to increased
reaction  rates due to increased cell density, no cell washout from matrix,
increased cell metabolism ( Brouers et al 1989). Dunaliella salina has been used
as a test organism for the detection of pesticide residues in water and soil (
Yarden et al 1993).
In order to test the effectiveness of the nature of the growth medium, the growth
was tested in batch and semicontinuous mode of culture conditions. In the
semicontinuous mode the medium was replaced after 10 days. It was noticed that
semicontinuous mode showed 66% higher growth than cells under batch mode
after 25 days of growth Table 2. It has been seen that hydrogen production in
Anabaena cylindrica that if fresh media was provided to the system, the
deteriorated cells would be replenished and the growth of new cells stimulated
thus enhancing the rate of production ( Jeffries et al. 1978). Cells immobilized in
matrix could be subjected to regular media exchange without washout (Philips
and Mitsui, 1985).

Table 3 illustrates the uptake of nitrate, ammonium & phosphate by the free
living immobilized cells. The uptake rate of nitrate was 44% in free-living and
62% in immobilized algae after 36 hrs. Uptake of ammonium was 25% in free
living and 42.2% in immobilized cells. Similarly phosphate uptake was 34.7%
in free-living and 64.7% in immobilized cells. Immobilized cells show a better
capacity of ions uptake than free living ones probably because of their mass
aggregation inside the matrix.
Effect of pH on the rate of ions uptake elicited pH 8 favorable for nitrate,
ammonium and phosphate uptake ( Table 4). The uptake was 15.3%, 11.6% and
25% higher for nitrate, ammonium and phosphate uptake in immobilized cells
than their free living counterparts. Effect of pH is important in the study because
any deviation on either side of pH 8 would inhibit the uptake rates probably due to
precipitation of ions in the medium.
Table 5 compares the biomass of alginate beads on the rate of ion uptake. At the
73biomass of 0.6µg chl a/ bead nitrate, ammonium and phosphate uptake was 20%,
15.3% and 19.6% higher in immobilized cells than free living ones.
Finally our results elicit the capability of immobilized D. salina cells for ions
uptake that can lead to the development of bioreactor for removal of ions through
immobilization.
