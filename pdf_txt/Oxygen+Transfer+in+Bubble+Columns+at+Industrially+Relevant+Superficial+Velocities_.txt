•Pharmaceutical industry
•Waste water treatment
•Biofuels and molecules (Research at NREL)
–Ethanol/Butane -diol/Methane
–Fermentation is a large cost contributor1
•Cost is important: low value products
–Improve economics through bioreactor design
•More engineering than biology
•Validated high- fidelity modeling
•Scale -up/reactor -design optimization 
•Techno -economic analysis

•Central idea: 
•These are not like the traditional bubble columns where lot of air is sparged 
(superficial velocities of ~1 m/s compared to ~10-2m/s)
•Only controlled amount of O2is required
•Too much O2will trigger creation of wrong products
•Not enough air will reduce the reaction rate overall, and thus the rate of production of the desired product –butanediol (BDO)
•Method
•Bubble column CFD + microbial bioreaction
•Reactions –5 species (microbe, glucose, xylose, acetoin and BDO)
•Assume these species are well mixed and O
2mixing is what limits reactions spatially
•Challenge 
•Long time scales for reactions ~ hours
•Sub-cycling/operator splitting
•Solve flow to steady -state
•Do reactions
•Redo until final reaction timeNREL    |    4Kinetics Model Development and Low- Order ResultsNREL    |    5Kinetics
