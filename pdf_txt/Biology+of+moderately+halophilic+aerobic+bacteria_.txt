INTRODUCTION
Compared to the extensive literature on the physiology, bio-
chemistry, and ecology of the aerobic red halophilic archaea(family Halobacteriaceae ), the aerobic halophilic bacteria have
been relatively little studied. Research on the halophilic andhalotolerant bacteria often seems to be less glamorous than thestudy of the archaea, with their unique adaptations, includinga highly saline cytoplasm, specialized salt-requiring proteins,and the unique light-driven proton and chloride pumps bacte-riorhodopsin and halorhodopsin (171). During early researchon the microbiology of hypersaline environments, the halo-philic bacteria were often neglected, even though they inhabita wide range of habitats such as saline lakes, saltern ponds,desert and hypersaline soils, and salted foods, a range muchless restricted than the habitats in which the halophilic archaeathrive (276, 284, 285).
However, Kushner (168) clearly states: “Though they are
less exciting at ﬁrst glance than the extreme halophiles themoderately halophilic bacteria, and solute-tolerant microor-ganisms in general, pose quite sufﬁciently interesting ques-tions, especially those implied by their ability to grow over wideranges of solute concentrations. Further work on these rela-tively little-studied microorganisms may be expected to bringdividends in the form of insight on the relation of internal andexternal solute concentrations, and on the state of cell-associ-ated ions within the cytoplasm. If the last decade has been thatof the extreme halophiles, we can hope that the next one willsee their more modest, moderate cousins (in the spiritual senseonly) take their proper place in the scientiﬁc canon.” Themoderately halophilic bacteria pose speciﬁc questions to thescientist, many of them related to their adaptability to a widerange of salinities. Thus, species such as Salinivibrio costicola
andHalomonas halodenitriﬁcans are able to grow over a range
of water activities between 0.98 (close to freshwater) to 0.86(close to saturated NaCl) (168). This in itself is a feat that maybe much more difﬁcult to achieve than the rigid, salt-requiringmetabolism of the halophilic archaea, which lyse the momentthe salt concentration in their environment drops below 10 to15%.The occurrence of nonpigmented halotolerant bacteria was
probably ﬁrst mentioned in 1919 by LeFevre and Round intheir study of the microbiology of cucumber fermentationbrines. One of the bacterial groups isolated grew in 0 to 15%NaCl, whereas other bacteria studied exhibited growth overthe range of 5 to 25% (178). An early classic study of halophilicbacteria is the work of Hof (127), who inoculated salt mudfrom a solar salt facility on Java onto a variety of media ofdifferent salinities. In addition to red archaeal types, differenttypes of white colonies were isolated, including endospore-containing Bacillus species able to grow at 24% NaCl. Using
media containing between 12 and 18% salt, she isolated aPseudomonas -type bacterium from salted beans preserved in
brines varying in salt concentration from 6 to 29%. This or-ganism, designated Pseudomonas beijerinckii , grew from 3 to
18% salt but not at 0.5%, showing its obligate halophilic char-acter. To quote from Hof’s paper: “it may be concluded thatmost of the important groups of bacteria are able to live inconcentrations up to about 15% salt and that many groups arephysiologically active even at much higher salt concentrations.”
To describe microorganisms according to their behavior to-
ward salt, different classiﬁcation schemes have been devised.Although several classiﬁcations or categories have been pro-posed (274, 329, 351), the most widely used is that of Kushner,who deﬁned moderate halophiles as organisms growing opti-mally between 0.5 and 2.5 M salt (168). Bacteria able to grow
in the absence of salt as well as in the presence of relativelyhigh salt concentrations (e.g., 8% in the case of Staphylococcus
aureus ) are designated halotolerant (or extremely halotolerant
if growth extends above 2.5 M). A rare case of a bacterium thatrequire s 2 M salt at least (optimal growth at 3.4 M), such as is
exempliﬁed by the actinomycete Actinopolyspora halophila
(95), is considered a borderline extreme halophile (137, 168).
It should be pointed out that the salt requirement and tol-
erance of many species vary according to growth conditionssuch as temperature and medium composition. The growthtemperature should be speciﬁed, especially for the deﬁnition ofthe lower salt range enabling growth. Thus, Marinococcus halo-
philus grows at NaCl concentrations as low as 0.01 M at 20°C
but at least 0.5 M is required at 25°C (228). Similarly, S. cos-VOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 505ticola can grow between 0.5 an d 4 M NaCl at 30°C but can grow
down to 0.2 M at 20°C (168).
TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY
Moderately halophilic bacteria constitute a heterogeneous
physiological group of microorganisms which belong to differ-ent genera. Our current knowledge of the taxonomic status ofthese bacteria contrasts with early studies, since in 1980 onlysix moderately halophilic species were included in the Ap-
proved Lists of Bacterial Names (312) and most strains used in
physiological and biochemical studies were isolated from salt-ed cured foods or unreﬁned salt or were even laboratory cul-ture contaminants. These moderate halophiles were Vibrio (Sal-
inivibrio )costicola (314), Micrococcus (Nesterenkonia )halobius
(237), Paracoccus (Halomonas )halodenitriﬁcans (159), Flavo-
bacterium (Halomonas )halmephilum (60), Planococcus (Mari-
nococcus )halophilus (228), and Spirochaeta halophila (103).
During the last decade, the extensive studies on hypersaline
environments that have been carried out in many geographicalareas have permitted the isolation and taxonomic character-ization of a large number of moderately halophilic species.Thus, moderate halophiles are represented by several meth-anogenic archaea as well as strictly anaerobic bacteria that havebeen reviewed recently (182, 232) and are not included in thisarticle. However, most species are gram-negative or gram-posi-tive aerobic or facultatively anaerobic moderately halophilicbacteria (340, 341). Although some gram-negative species wereconsidered members of different genera ( Halomonas ,Deleya ,Volcaniella ,Flavobacterium ,Paracoccus ,Pseudomonas ,Halo-
vibrio ,o rChromobacterium ), phenotypic and phylogenetic data
support their close relationship, and they are currently includ-ed in the family Halomonadaceae as members of two genera:
Halomonas and Chromohalobacter (53, 76). Table 1 shows the
features that differentiate the validly published moderately halo-philic species included in these two genera.
Besides members of the family Halomonadaceae , several
other gram-negative strictly aerobic or facultatively anaerobicspecies have been described as moderate halophiles belongingto genera that include nonhalophilic species as well, such asPseudomonas ,Flavobacterium ,o rSpirochaeta , while others are
placed in genera represented, at least until now, exclusively byhalophilic species: Salinivibrio ,Arhodomonas ,o rDichotomicro-
bium . The differential features of these species are shown in
Table 2.
Three organisms have been extensively used in physiological
and biochemical studies dealing with the mechanisms of halo-adaptation and adaptability: Salinivibrio costicola ,Halomonas
elongata , and Halomonas israelensis.
S. costicola was originally isolated from rib bones in a sample
of Australian bacon (91, 314). Similar strains have been iso-lated from saltern ponds near Alicante (96) and other locationsin Spain and the Canary Islands (91).
H. elongata was isolated from a solar salt facility on Bonaire,
Netherlands Antilles. It is an extremely versatile organism,able to grow at a very wide range of salt concentrations. It canalso grow anaerobically with nitrate as the electron acceptor,TABLE 1. Main characteristics of moderately halophilic gram-negative members of the Halomonadaceaea

tatively on glucose (357). However, glucose fermentation wasnot conﬁrmed in later studies (83).
H. israelensis (previously designated strain Ba
1) was original-
ly obtained from unreﬁned solar salt obtained from the DeadSea (272, 273) and was only recently assigned a species name(128).
The gram-positive moderately halophilic aerobic bacteria,
with the exception of two Bacillus species, belong to genera that
include only species with halophilic requirements: the generaHalobacillus ,Marinococcus ,Salinicoccus ,Nesterenkonia , and
Tetragenococcus . The validly described species currently ac-
cepted as moderate halophiles and their characteristics areshown in Table 3. Finally, there are some moderately halophil-ic actinomycetes that have been recently isolated from differ-ent saline soil samples and have been characterized as speciesof the genera Actinopolyspora orNocardiopsis . Table 4 shows
the differential characteristics of these four moderately halo-philic species.
Besides these moderately halophilic species that have been
characterized taxonomically and, according to the rules of thecode of nomenclature of bacteria, are considered validly de-scribed species, there are several other moderately halophilicaerobic bacteria that have been used for other purposes, in-cluding physiological, biochemical, and biotechnological stud-ies, but have not been studied taxonomically in detail. Typicalexamples are “ Pseudomonas halosaccharolytica ” (120, 121) and
“Micrococcus varians subsp. halophilus ” (241).
Recent studies based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis havepermitted a determination of the phylogenetic position of most
moderately halophilic bacteria. During last decade, the oldtechnique of comparison of 16S rRNA oligonucleotide cata-logs showed that Spirochaeta halophila belongs to the spiro-
chete phylum and that some Halomonas andDeleya species are
members of the gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria (341).
They were placed in a new family, Halomonadaceae (76). More
recently, complete 16S rRNA sequence analysis conﬁrmed thatSpirochaeta halophila is within the Spirochaeta cluster of the
spirochete phylum, related to Spirochaeta isovalerica ,S. litora-
lis,S. bajacaliforniensis , and S. aurantia (average similarity,
87.4%) (253). In addition, several studies have identiﬁed thephylogenetic position of most gram-negative moderately halo-philic aerobic species currently described. Members of thegenera Halomonas ,Deleya ,Halovibrio , and Volcaniella , as well
asParacoccus halodenitriﬁcans , form a monophyletic group
within the gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria (53, 56, 200,
204, 290). The levels of 16S rRNA sequence similarity amongthese species ranged from 91.5 to 100%; although several sub-groups, which might represent separate genera, were resolved,they could not be differentiated on the basis of phenotypic orchemotaxonomicfeatures.Forthesereasons,DobsonandFranz-mann (53) proposed placing all members of the above fourgenera and P. halodenitriﬁcans in a single genus, the genus
Halomonas , and emended the description of the family Hal-
omonadaceae . This family now comprises the species of Halo-
monas and Zymobacter and the moderate halophile, originally
isolated from the Dead Sea, Chromohalobacter marismortui
(200). All have 15 signature characteristics in their 16S rRNATABLE 1— Continued

486 (53). Arhodomonas aquaeolei represents a deeply branch-
ing lineage in the gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria , most
closely related to purple sulfur bacteria (particularly speciesof the genera Ectothiorhodospira and Chromatium ). The 16S
rRNA sequence analysis supports the placement of this singlespecies in a separate genus (4).
Very recently, the phylogenetic position of six ( Salini )vibrio
costicola strains revealed that this moderate halophile consti-
tutes a monophyletic branch that is distinct from other Vibrio
species and from other species belonging to the gamma sub-class of the Proteobacteria (202). Since other phenotypic and
genotypic data supported these differences, placement of thisspecies in a separate genus, Salinivibrio , has been proposed
(201).
The 16S rRNA sequences of Flavobacterium gondwanense
andF. salegens , two moderate halophiles isolated from a hyper-
saline Antarctic lake, contain the deﬁnitive ﬂavobacterial sig-natures that unequivocally place them in the Flavobacterium-
Bacteroides phylum (52). These species cluster with a group of
organisms that contains the type species of the genus Flavobac-
terium ,F. aquatile (with 89 and 90% sequence similarity be-
tween them and this species) (52).
Recent studies have determined the phylogenetic relation-
ships of moderate halophiles within the gram-positive branch.Farrow et al. (64) showed that Marinococcus halophilus (for-
merly Planococcus halophilus ) forms a distinct line of descent
and is only distantly related to the genera Planococcus ,Sporo-
sarcina , and Bacillus . The 16S rRNA sequence data conﬁrm
the placement of M. halophilus in a separate genus. In addition,
they indicated that Sporosarcina halophila , an endospore-form-
ing motile gram-positive moderate halophile, was not closelyrelated to Sporosarcina ureae , the type species of this genus.
Later studies permitted the placement of S. halophila in a new
genus, Halobacillus ,a s H. halophilus , closely related to oth-
er moderately halophilic species isolated from the Great SaltLake, H. litoralis and H. trueperi (315). This study also con-
ﬁrmed the placement of Salinicoccus roseus in a separate
genus, since it constitutes a deep branch not closely relatedto other gram-positive bacteria. Bacillus salexigens is closely
related to Bacillus pantothenticus , a species that belongs to
phylogenetic group I of the genus Bacillus , as well as to Halo-
bacillus halophilus ,H. litoralis , and the halotolerant species
Bacillus dipsosauri (89). Tetragenococcus muriaticus , a recently
described species isolated from a traditionally fermented Jap-anese ﬁsh sauce, is closely related to the halotolerant speciesTetragenococcus halophilus (formerly Pediococcus halophilus ),
which showed a closer phylogenetic relationship to other lacticacid bacteria of the enterococci and lactobacilli than to pedio-cocci (304).
While all these moderately halophilic species belong to the
low-G 1C group of the gram-positive phylum, only Nesteren-
konia halobia (formerly Micrococcus halobius ) is within the
high-G 1C group (218, 316), constituting a cluster that is
clearly separate from other species of the genera Micrococcus ,
Arthrobacter , and Kocuria.
The recent phylogenetic studies of moderate halophiles have
been based on the comparison of 16S rRNA sequence data.These studies have been very helpful for improving the classi-ﬁcation of moderate halophiles according to a natural (phylo-genetic) approach. In particular, results show that they arerepresented in many of the major bacterial phyla: spirochetes,Proteobacteria ,Flavobacterium-Bacteroides , and low-G 1C and
high-G 1C gram-positive organisms. A recent study of African
soda lakes showed a wide phylogenetic diversity within thealkaliphilic (and in some cases halophilic) isolates (58). As withthe moderate halophiles, these authors concluded that the
alkaliphile phenotype is also polyphyletic and might haveevolved many times (58).

halophilic bacteria in thalassohaline (seawater-derived) hyper-saline environments, such as saltern ponds for concentratingseawater, may to a large extent resemble the communitiespresent in seawater. This is not too surprising, since manymarine bacteria have a broad salt tolerance. It was even re-ported that the majority of 30 isolates of marine aerobic het-erotrophic bacteria tested could grow at up to 20% NaCl andthat some could even multiply in media containing 30% NaCl(72). Moderately halophilic bacteria could also be enrichedfrom seawater by gradual salinity increases: when seawater wasperiodically amended with salt and nutrients, moderately halo-philic bacteria outcompeted the slightly halophilic marine bac-teria, which completely disappeared above 15% salt (347). Avariety of halophilic bacteria were also isolated from sea sandsand seaweeds (235). Thus, the sea contains many moderatelyhalophilic or at least extremely halotolerant bacteria. In a studyof Spanish saltern ponds of intermediate salinity (between 15and 30% sea salts) (Alicante on the Mediterranean coast,Huelva on the Atlantic coast), the dominant types of coloniesdeveloping on agar plates were assigned by numerical taxon-omy to the genera Salinivibrio , the Pseudomonas-Alteromonas-
Alcaligenes group, Acinetobacter , and Flavobacterium (284–
286). Most of these isolates should probably be reclassiﬁed inthe family Halomonadaceae . Most isolates grew optimally at
about 10% salts (the concentration that also yielded the largestnumber of CFU on agar plates) and could be found at saltconcentrations up to about 25%. ( Salinivibrio species domi-
nated below 15% salt, while bacteria assigned to the Pseudo-
monas-Alteromonas-Alcaligenes group were especially abun-
dant above 15%. Flavobacterium andAcinetobacter were found
in smaller numbers and were evenly distributed up to 30%,while gram-positive cocci were found mostly above 25% salt(286). Most of the 140 isolates from the Huelva salterns clus-tered in eight phenons, two of which were identiﬁed as Halo-
monas (Deleya ) (53), four resembled S. costicola , and the oth-
ers were tentatively assigned to the genera Flavobacterium and
Acinetobacter (187). Similar Acinetobacter -like bacteria (prob-
ably to be assigned to the Halomonadaceae ) have been found
in other hypersaline habitats (265).
Numerical taxonomic studies have been performed in in-
land, athalassohaline salterns near Granada, Spain (39, 41,274), and Chile (262). The La Mala ´ saltern near Granada is fed
by brines from a subterranean well which is lower in Cl
2and
higher in Mg21,C a21, and K1than seawater. Of the 174
strains isolated, 74 were assigned to the genus ( Salini )vibrio ,2 2
were assigned to Alteromonas , 43 were assigned to Halomonas
(Deleya ) (53), 7 were assigned to Acinetobacter , 13 were as-
signed to Pseudomonas , and 9 were assigned to Flavobacterium
(37). An even more unusual inland saltern is the Salar deAtacama, Chile, located in the Atacama desert at 2,700 mabove sea level. The most abundant isolates obtained from thisenvironment were ( Salini )vibrio strains, followed by Acineto-
bacter ,Marinomonas , and Alteromonas (262).
Lake Assal in Djibouti (French Somaliland) contains 27.7%
salts in its surface layers, increasing to 39.8% at a depth of20 m. Of the 164 isolates obtained, 11 were moderate halo-VOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 509philes requiring 3 to 15% salt, 7 were extremely halophilic
archaea, 2 did not tolerate salt, and the great majority wereslightly halophilic, requiring 1 to 5% NaCl (16). The authorsconcluded that “it is clear that the bacteria were, on the whole,common bacteria belonging to the same species which arecurrently isolated from large and small rivers and from seawa-ter.” This result is unexpected in view of the high salt concen-trations prevailing in Lake Assal and the high temperature ofthe water (33 to 34°C), which seem more suitable to the de-velopment of extremely halophilic archaea than of marine-typeslightly or moderately halophilic bacteria. Regretably, addi-tional studies of this interesting but poorly accessible environ-ment have not been reported.
A sadly neglected hunting ground for interesting new types
of moderately halophilic bacteria is the Great Salt Lake, Utah,which has seen drastic changes in its salinity during the last de-cades. Most studies of its microbiology have centered aroundthe red halophilic archaea and the Dunaliella communities
(244, 258, 261). Attempts to enumerate viable bacteria in com-plex medium with 5, 13, and 20% NaCl yielded 3.6 310
5, 9.33
105, and 2.4 3106CFU/ml, respectively, with surface water
from the north arm of the lake (22% salt), and 7.5 3105, 1.13
105, and 1.5 3103cells/ml, respectively, when surface water
from the south arm (8.5% salt) served as the inoculum (65).The data presented do not allow a differentiation betweencolorless bacteria and red archaea, but it was stated that mod-erately halophilic bacteria make up the predominant popula-tion in the south arm whereas extremely halophilic archaeapredominate in the north arm. The Great Salt Lake yielded anumber of new species: Pseudomonas halophila ,Halomonas
variabilis (53, 65), Halobacillus litoralis , and Halobacillus true-
peri(315).
Although halophilic bacteria can easily be isolated from the
Dead Sea by means of enrichment cultures (242, 349), nosystematic studies have been performed on their abundance inthis extremely hypersaline (presently around 34%), athalasso-haline (around 1.8 M Mg

ably colorless bacteria (362). Some of the early isolates werecharacterized further and described as Chromohalobacter (orig-
inally Chromobacterium )marismortui (343), “ Pseudomonas
halestorgus ” (subsequently lost), and Halomonas (originally
Flavobacterium )halmophila (54, 60, 350). Another colorless
isolate from the Dead Sea is Halomonas israelensis (also known
as strain Ba
1) (128, 170).
Subterranean brines have also been subject to microbiolog-
ical studies. Several euryhaline microorganisms belonging totheHalomonadaceae , possibly including some novel species,
were isolated from Permian underground salt formations inthe United States which were penetrated by meteoric waterswhich slowly solubilize the salt (356). A subterranean brineassociated with an oil ﬁeld in Oklahoma yielded Arhodomonas
aquaeolei , an aerobic, organic acid-metabolizing, gram-nega-
tive, motile rod, growing in the range of 6 to 20% NaCl with anoptimum of 15% (4).
(ii) Saline soils. The soil habitat is inherently inhomoge-
neous, and it can be expected that a wide range of salinitiesmight be present in any one saline soil (101). Saline soils ap-pear to yield mostly halotolerant rather than halophilic micro-
organisms, presumably reﬂecting adaptation to periodic epi-sodes of relatively high dilution (267, 268). One early studystated that microorganisms may be unable to multiply in salinesoil and that the microbiota of saline soil habitats are passiveinhabitants brought by the wind. In this study, soils near theRed Sea, with a salt content varying from 25 to 30% on thesurface to 1.5 to 2% at a depth of 50 cm, were examined. Thehighest bacterial counts were obtained in surface soil, usingmedia without NaCl. The numbers obtained were much small-er than those commonly found in nonsaline soils. The authorsstated that “the accepted assumption about the widespreaddistribution of salt-resistant and halophilic microorganisms insaline soils requires reconsideration” (116).
Later studies have unequivocally conﬁrmed the abundance
of halophilic bacteria in saline soils. The species composition insoils differs greatly from that of the aquatic environments dis-cussed above: while Salinivibrio abounds in salt lakes and salt-
erns, the dominant types encountered in saline soils belong togenera such as Bacillus ,Pseudomonas ,Alcaligenes (last two

OL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 511ceae), and Micrococcus (possibly Nesterenkonia ) (268, 285). A
saline soil near Alicante, Spain, with a Cl2content between 2.4
and 12.7% yielded a high proportion of nonmotile rods onmedia containing 10 or 20% salt; this type of bacterium is onlyrarely isolated from aquatic hypersaline environments (265).The most abundant types were assigned to the genera Alcali-
genes ,Acinetobacter ,Flavobacterium , and Pseudomonas . Many
halotolerant gram-positive bacteria were also found. Faculta-tive anaerobes were rare. Most isolates required moderatelyhigh salt (5 to 10%) for optimal growth but were also able togrow at low salinities (0.5 to 2%) (267). This probably reﬂectsthe ecological difference between water and soil environments,with water being relatively homogeneous and constant and soilbeing heterogeneous and affected by factors such as rainfall(267, 268). A study was made of the rhizosphere soil near xero-phytic plants growing in hypersaline soils (5 to 10.7% NaCl)near Alicante, showing that the range of salt concentrationsallowing growth of the organisms isolated did not correlatewith the salinity of the soil from which they were isolated. Mostisolates showed salt optima between 5 and 15% NaCl, butabout half of the strains also grew at 0.9% NaCl. Plating onagar media containing 10% salt yielded mostly gram-positiverods, whereas gram-negative rods dominated between 10 and20% salt and Gram-positive cocci developed above 20% salt.The gram-positive bacteria thus isolated were assigned to thegenera (in order of abundance) Bacillus ,Micrococcus ,Arthro-
bacter ,Staphylococcus ,Planococcus ,Corynebacterium ,Nocar-
dia, and Actinomyces (268).
Saline soils have been somewhat neglected compared to hy-
persaline aquatic environments. The recent isolation of novelhalophilic Actinopolyspora and Nocardiopsis species from saltysoils in Death Valley (Calif.), Alicante, and Iraq (6, 291, 370,
373) suggests that a wealth of interesting unknown halophilicmicroorganisms may be present in these soils.
(iii) Cold saline habitats. Extensive microbiological studies
in the Antarctic, especially the cold saline lakes in the VestfoldHills region and the saline soils of the Dry Valleys, have con-tributed some interesting insights into the extreme conditionsunder which halophilic bacteria may occur and thrive.
The Vestfold Hills region is a coastal, ice-free area in east
Antarctica, which contains in excess of 300 lakes and ponds.These are relics of seawater catchments isolated some 6,000years ago by uplift and trapped in valleys and depressions.Some of these lakes are hypersaline; the most saline lakes havea total salt concentration of up to 28%. Salinity may showseasonal variations due to meltstream inﬂux and ice cover meltin the Austral summer. The best studied is Organic Lake, ameromictic lake with a maximum depth of 7.5 m. The lake isstratiﬁed, with salt concentrations increasing from 0.8 to 21%,and is anoxic below a depth of 4 to 5 m. The ice cover excludeswind-induced turbulence throughout winter. Thermal proﬁleand the increasing salinity with depth prevent turnover in theice-free summer period. Temperatures range from 214 to
115°C (73, 195, 196).
Many strains of moderate halophiles, belonging to genera
including Halomonas ,Flavobacterium , and Cytophaga , were iso-
lated from the lake. Hexadecane- and phenanthrene-degradingbacteria were also found (196). Most isolates were able to growfrom 0.5 to 20% NaCl and at temperatures as low as 0 to 5°C(55, 74). The species isolated include Halomonas subglacies-
cola, growing at salt concentrations between 0.5 and 20%, with
a predicted minimum temperature of 23.3 to 29.2°C, an op-TABLE 4. Main characteristics of moderately halophilic actinomycete speciesa

var I grows optimally at 1 to 3% NaCl and 28 to 40°C andtolerates NaCl up to 20 to 25% and temperatures up to 45°C,while biovar II grows best at 0.5 to 3% NaCl and 34 to 38°Cand tolerates up to 25 to 30% NaCl and 47°C but is also ableto grow at 25°C (134); and two yellow-orange isolates, named
Flavobacterium gondwanense andF. salegens , both showing op-
timal growth at 5% NaCl and growing at up to 15 to 20% NaCl(52, 55).
The bacteria of Antarctic saline environments display an
ability to grow at reduced temperatures compared with theirtaxonomic counterparts from tropical and temperate environ-ments (195). It was postulated that since the saline lakes of theVestfold Hills are geologically young, the resident bacteriahave not yet evolved mechanisms that may enable them togrow in these environments in winter when temperatures fallbelow their minimum required for growth and that, given fur-ther evolution, organisms that can exploit these environmentsmore fully may develop (73).
Also, the soils of the Antarctic Dry Valleys have yielded
some interesting salt-tolerant bacteria, such as a halotolerantPlanococcus that grows from 0 to 40°C in the presence of 0 to
2 M NaCl (207). Additional halotolerant gram-positive cocciwere obtained from saline soils in geothermal regions in Ant-arctica. One such isolate, tentatively assigned to the genusMicrococcus , tolerates NaCl concentrations between 0 and 4.2
M (221). Since this strain originated from a thermal area within situ temperatures of up to 40°C, it is not surprising that itdoes not share the psychrophilic or psychrotolerant propertiesof the other strains mentioned above: its optimum temperatureis 37°C, and no growth was observed below 20°C.
(iv) Alkaline saline habitats. Stable alkaline hypersaline en-
vironments are not common and are the result of an unusualcombination of geological, geographical, and climatic condi-tions (102). Most studies on the alkaline saline environmentshave concentrated on lakes such as Lake Magadi, Kenya, andthe Wadi Natrun lakes, Egypt, which are dominated by ex-tremely halophilic archaea.
A novel representative of the Halomonas group was recently
isolated from sand of Venere Lake, Pantelleria Island, Italy.This aerobic pleomorphic rod, designated Halomonas pantel-
leriense , grows optimally at pH 9 (range, 7.5 to 11) and 10%
NaCl (range, 1.25 to 15%) (290). Some interesting gram-neg-ative halophilic bacteria were obtained from the alkaline (pH9.8), saline (9% total salts) Mono Lake, Calif. One strain wasisolated on a medium containing glycine betaine as the majorcarbon and energy source. Others were isolated on a mediumcontaining dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). All isolatesgrew at NaCl concentrations from 1.5 to 3 M, and growth wasmuch better at pH 9.7 than at pH 7. Glycine betaine is degrad-ed by sequential demethylation via dimethylglycine to sarco-sine, which is excreted into the medium. DMSP is either cleavedto dimethyl sulﬁde and acrylate or degraded by demethylation,with 3-methiolpropionate as the intermediate, yielding meth-anethiol (32, 51). Glycine betaine and DMSP may be found assubstrates for bacterial degradation in Mono Lake, since theyare produced by cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplanktonas osmotic solutes.
A haloalkaliphilic gram-positive bacterium was isolated from
Lake Gabara in the Wadi Natrun, Egypt, and named Bacillus
haloalkaliphilus ; this isolate tolerates up t o 4 M NaCl but grows
best from 0.5 t o 3 M (327, 361). Additional strains assigned to
the species B. haloalkaliphilus have been isolated from brine,
dried soil, mud and dung samples from the Wadi Natrun (78).(v) Salted ﬁsh, meat, and other foods. Although moderately
halophilic bacteria are often found on salted ﬁsh, meat, andother food products and regardless of their possible involve-ment in microbial spoilage at high salt concentrations, system-atic studies on the occurrence of such bacteria on ﬁsh and meatproducts have rarely been performed.
Moderate halophiles can easily be isolated from materials
such as salted and dried ﬁsh, ﬁsh intestines, soy sauce mashes,and other similar materials (235, 307). Recently, 128 strains ofmoderate halophiles were isolated from bachalao (dried saltedcodﬁsh) and from fresh cod and curing salt used in its preser-vation. In fully cured wet and dry bachalao (which containsabout 19% salt), between 10
3and 107moderate halophiles
were found per g. Two primary colony types, smooth and rough,dominated in wet and dry bachalao, respectively. The bacteriaforming the smooth colony type are similar to Halomonas
salina and grew in 0.1 to 4.5 M NaCl at 15 to 37°C (348). In the
curing of anchovies, Pediococcus halophilus became the dom-
inant bacterium at the end of the curing process; this organismdevelops under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It showedoptimum growth at 6.5 to 10% NaCl and tolerated over 15%NaCl (349).
(vi) Unusual habitats. Moderately halophilic bacteria may
be found in some unusual environments, such as on desertplants and desert animals.
Atriplex halinus (family Chenopodiaceae ) is a desert plant
widespread in the Negev Desert, Israel, and in other desertenvironments. The leaves excrete salt through salt glands, thenumber and size of which depend on the amount of saltpresent during growth of the plant. Salt (predominantly NaCl)crystallizes on the leaves when the salt gland bladders burst.During the dry season, signiﬁcant amounts of salts and organicmaterial coat the leaf surface. The nightly occurrence of dewcauses a diurnal wetting, so that the phylloplane microorgan-isms experience large ﬂuctuations in salinity and water activity,including repeated desiccation. Between 1 310
4and 5 3105
bacteria were enumerated per cm2of leaf surface. The diver-
sity of culturable bacteria was limited, with the dominant or-ganism being an orange pigmented bacterium, identiﬁed as aPseudomonas sp., growing from 0.05% to 20% NaCl with an
optimum at 5% and 30°C (311).
Even more unusual is the isolation of a halotolerant Bacillus
sp. from the nasal cavities of desert iguanas. These animalspossess salt glands in their nasal cavities that allow them toexcrete a concentrated KCl brine during osmotic stress. ABacillus sp. was isolated, showing excellent growth in 2.2 M
KCl and with an optimum growth temperature of 45°C (50).
Morphological and Physiological Diversity
The preponderance of nonspecialized heterotrophs among
the known bacterial halophiles does not necessarily reﬂecttheir dominance in salt lakes, saline soils, and other salinehabitats but, rather, may be due to the relative ease of cultur-ing these bacteria (136). The halophilic property is probablywidespread in the bacterial domain and may occur in a varietyof morphological and physiological types. This is nicely illus-trated by the studies of Hirsch, who differentiated 104 differentmorphotypes of bacteria in the hypersaline Solar Lake on theshore of the Sinai peninsula. This small and shallow (maximumdepth, about 5 m) thalassohaline lake is stratiﬁed in winter,with an epilimnion containing 4.5 to 9% salt, increasing toabout 19% at the bottom. In addition to salt stress, tempera-ture may be an important selective factor, since in the upperhypolimnion heliothermal heating can increase the tempera-ture to about 60°C in winter. During the summer season, theVOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 513lake is mixed and hypersaline (18 to 19%). Morphologically
diverse bacteria were observed by direct examination of sam-ples, in enrichments, and in pure cultures; they included cocci,rods, apple-shaped budding bacteria, long ﬂexible ﬁlaments,spindle-shaped bacteria, short pointed ﬁlaments, and branchedhyphae (123). A budding prosthecate bacterium with branch-ing hyphae was obtained in culture and described as Dichoto-
microbium thermohalophilum (124). Similar strains have been
isolated from a coastal saline lake in Brazil. The nearly tetra-hedral mother cells produce up to four hyphae at the tips,on which nonmotile buds are formed. The isolates grow from0.8–4 to 18–22% salt, depending on the strain, with an opti-mum at 8 to 14%, and are moderately thermophilic (growing atup to 52 to 65°C). Their metabolism is strictly aerobic, andorganic acids are used as carbon and energy sources. However,these bacteria were also found at greater depths in Solar Lakeand could be isolated from the anaerobic hypolimnion at adepth of 3.5 m (123, 124). Solar Lake was also the source fromwhich the facultative aerobe Spirochaeta halophila was isolated
(103).
Many of the aerobic moderately halophilic bacteria can use
nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor. Thus, Halomonas
elongata can grow anaerobically by reducing nitrate to nitrite
(357). Other well-known nitrate reducers are H. halodenitriﬁ-
cans andBacillus halodenitriﬁcans . The latter was isolated from
a solar saltern in the south of France by enrichment in mediumcontaining 1.06 M NaNO
3. It grows at NaCl concentrations
between 0.35 to 4.25 M (optimum, 0.5 to 1.35 M) and isunusually tolerant to nitrite: growth is possible in 0.58 MNaNO
2. Since nitrous oxide reductase is absent, N2Oi st h e
sole product of nitrate and nitrite reduction (49).
Considerable diversity also exists with respect to the carbon
and energy sources used. Hydrocarbons can be used up toquite high salinities. A series of enrichment cultures success-fully produced mineral oil degraders by using water from theGreat Salt Lake, Utah, as an inoculum at salinities up to17.2%. Experiments with radiolabeled hexadecane showed de-creasing degradation rates with increasing salinity (360).
Aromatic compounds such as benzoate may be degrad-
ed by versatile halophilic bacteria such as H. halodurans ,
which cleaves aromatic rings by ortho cleavage (290). Even
more exotic compounds may be utilized at high salinities, asillustrated by strain JD6.5, an Alteromonas type of organism
growing at 2 to 24% salt and degrading several highly toxicorganophosphorus compounds (38). Another Halomonas iso-
late degraded formaldehyde and proved highly tolerant to highformaldehyde concentrations (8, 250, 251).
Many additional metabolic functions may exist within the
highly diverse group delineated by the common denominator“aerobic, halophilic bacteria”. Thus, the moderately halophilicThiobacillus halophilus , isolated from a Western Australian
hypersaline lake (Lake O’Grady North), grows at salt concen-trations of up to 4 M. It is a chemoautotroph that oxidizesreduced sulfur compounds (365). Aerobic halophilic methylo-trophic bacteria were described as well (57). Many species ofcyanobacteria are also moderate halophiles. However, they willnot be discussed within the framework of this review, whichdeals primarily with heterotrophs. Whether moderately halo-philic counterparts exist for all types of bacterial metabolismthat occur in freshwater and marine environments is still un-known. One function that seems to be missing in the hetero-trophic bacterial communities at high salt concentrations is theability to ﬁx molecular nitrogen. This fact was already recog-nized by Hof (127), who pointed out that N
2ﬁxers could be
isolated on 0 and 3% salt but not on 6% and higher. Largenumbers of bacteria able to grow in a nitrogen-free mediumcould be isolated from saline soil (Granada, Spain), but nitro-
genase activity was not detected (275).
It is evident that very few attempts have been made to isolate
specialized and unusual types of halophilic aerobic bacteria.Therefore, one may assume that many more physiologicaltypes remain to be discovered.
Measurement of In Situ Activities
Little is known about the in situ activity of halophilic bacte-
ria in saline lakes, salterns, saline soils, and other habitats.
A few attempts have been made to assess microbial activities
in the Great Salt Lake, Utah, by incubating water samples fromthe less saline southern part (8.5% salt) and the more salinenorthern half (22% salt) with [
14C]glucose, [14C]glycerol, or
[14C]acetate and monitoring the appearance of the radioactive
label as14CO2. Lowered rates of breakdown of the three sub-
strates were found at the higher salinity (66), a ﬁnding that par-allels the lowered dissimilation of [
14C]hexadecane by Great
Salt Lake water samples with increasing salinity (360).
Measurements of [ methyl -3H]thymidine incorporation by
heterotrophic communities in increasingly saline saltern pondsin Spain showed that the growth rate was highest between 5and 10% salt. This was much higher than in the community ofarchaea present in ponds with salt concentrations exceeding20% (104). A similar ﬁnding was reported from the Eilat salt-ern ponds at the coast of the Red Sea, where the estimateddoubling times of the bacteria in ponds of low to intermediatesalinity was 1.1 to 12 days, based on the thymidine incorpora-tion rate (245).
Molecular Approaches to the Elucidation of the
Community Structure of Halophilic Bacteria
in Hypersaline Environments
In recent years, the characterization of 16S rRNA genes
isolated directly from the environment has been used to obtaininformation on prokaryotic community structure. The tech-nique has not yet been extensively applied to hypersaline en-vironments. However, 16S rRNA genes were ampliﬁed by PCRfrom a saltern crystallizer pond in Spain. As expected, in viewof the high salinity, archaeal sequences were recovered mostfrequently while bacteria represented only a minor component.One cluster of bacterial sequences showed about 82% identitytoRhodopseudomonas marina (alpha subclass of the Proteo-
bacteria ) (13, 14). To enable comparison of the prokaryotic
communities in the salt concentration gradient presented bythe salterns (preparation ponds of 6.4 and 9.2% salt, concen-trator ponds of 13.3 and 21.6% salt, and an NaCl precipitationpond of 30.8% salt), ﬁngerprinting of the community was per-formed with different restriction endonucleases. The highestsimilarities were found between the two concentrator pondsand between the two preparation ponds. The bacterial com-munity decreased in complexity with increasing salinity. Thebacterial genes isolated from the crystallizer pond showed littlesimilarity to the genes isolated from the less saline ponds.Thus, it is improbable that the bacteria in the crystallizer pondrepresent only a carryover of inactive cells from the previousevaporation stage (13, 191).
Competition between Halophilic Bacteria and Archaea
The halophilic bacteria form a versatile group, adapted to
life at the lower range of salinities and with the possibility ofrapid adjustment to changes in the external salt concentration.In contrast, the halophilic archaea (family Halobacteriaceae )
are generally found at higher salinities and their requirement514 VENTOSA ET AL. MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.for high salt concentrations for the maintenance of structural
cell components makes them strictly dependent on the con-stant presence of high salt concentrations (3 t o 4 M for most
species). Accordingly, the two groups occupy different niches,which seem to overlap very little (247). When heterotrophicbacteria from Spanish saltern ponds of increasing salinity wereenumerated on agar plates, only a narrow salinity range (25 to32% total salt) was found to contain the two groups (288). Asimilar conclusion was reached in studies in which amino acidincorporation by the heterotrophic communities in salternponds in Eilat, Israel, was measured. When inhibitors speciﬁ-cally directed against the halophilic archaea (bile salts such astaurocholate or deoxycholate and the protein synthesis inhib-itor anisomycin) or bacteria (chloramphenicol or erythromy-cin) were tested, the contribution of each group could bedistinguished. Up to a salinity of about 25%, all amino acidincorporation activity was inhibited by the bacterial inhibitors,while above 25%, inhibitors known to act on the archaea com-pletely inhibited all activity (243, 244, 246). Similarly, aphidi-colin, an inhibitor of DNA replication in halophilic archaea,completely inhibited thymidine incorporation in saltern brineswith salinities exceeding 25% (245, 246).
Competition between halophilic bacteria and archaea has
also been studied in laboratory model systems. When samplesfrom the subterranean saline well that supplies the salternponds of La Mala ´ near Granada, Spain, were subjected to
gradual salinity changes with additional nutrient enrichment,marine-type slightly halophilic bacteria, halotolerant types,moderate halophiles, and extremely halophilic archaea wereenriched, depending on the ﬁnal salt concentration achieved.Marine and moderately halophilic types were most abundantbetween 3 and 30% salt. At 25°C, hardly any development ofextremely halophilic archaea was observed at the higher salin-ities, but at 35°C, dense communities of archaea were obtainedat 35 and 40% salt, suggesting that temperature is an importantfactor in determining the outcome of the competition (40).The importance of temperature was conﬁrmed in chemostatstudies in which competition was examined in continuous cul-ture, with a mixed natural community from a Spanish saltern asthe inoculum. Salt concentration, temperature, and nutrientconcentration (dilution rate) were used as variables (287). Atlow salt concentrations, the moderately halophilic bacteria wonthe competition, while at the highest salinities, the pigmentedarchaea outcompeted the bacteria. Within the intermediatesalt concentration range (20 to 30%), temperature was the de-cisive factor determining the outcome, with the bacteria beingfavored by low temperatures. Also differences in the afﬁnity forlow concentrations of organic nutrients determined the resultof the competition experiments: bacterial strains that grewslowly in batch cultures often predominated in chemostat cul-tures at low dilution rates thanks to their higher afﬁnity fornutrients. In nutrient-rich batch cultures, the halophilic bacte-ria generally grew faster than the archaea, even at the highNaCl concentrations preferred by the archaeal types (287).The average growth rate of pigmented archaea (39 strainstested) in complex medium was 0.02 h
21at 25% salt, while
nonpigmented bacterial strains (93 strains tested) grew muchmore rapidly (average optimal growth rate, 0.06 h
21at 10%
salt, with a broad optimum between 2 and 25%) (288).
Biogeochemical Importance
Several strains of moderately halophilic bacteria may be
involved in the precipitation of CaCO3(calcite, aragonite) and
other minerals (41). No direct evidence exists for the activeinvolvement of these bacteria in the formation of mineral de-posits in nature, either recent or ancient, but the phenomenon
observed in cultures is of sufﬁcient interest to be discussedhere.
Most studies on the subject used Halomonas halophila as the
model organism, and the minerals formed were identiﬁed byX-ray diffraction. In a test of 27 isolates, all caused the forma-tion of CaCO
3crystals as long as conditions allowed bacterial
growth. Most crystals were spherical and consisted of calciteand magnesium calcite, in which MgCO
3forms a signiﬁcant
part of the crystal (75 to 85% Ca and 25 to 15% Mg); the ratiobetween these minerals depended on the salinity and mediumcomposition. High magnesium concentrations inhibitedCaCO
3precipitation by H. halophila . Growth at low salinity
favored crystal formation, while at low temperature and/or athigh salinity, crystal formation was repressed. The bacteriainﬂuenced the type of CaCO
3crystal formed in vitro, and this
effect may be species speciﬁc (42, 68, 280, 281). Calciﬁcationcommences with a nucleus formed by aggregation of a fewcalciﬁed bacterial cells and subsequent accumulation of morecalciﬁed cells and carbonate, which holds the bacteria together.This results in the formation of spherical bioliths of about 50mm in diameter (282). To what extent the precipitation of
CaCO
3was triggered by a local increase in pH or whether the
bacteria served only as crystallization nuclei was never ascer-tained.
Moderately halophilic isolates assigned to the genera Flavo-
bacterium and Acinetobacter make calcite, and Acinetobacter
also produces aragonite. High temperatures and low ionicstrengths favor crystal formation. Flavobacterium makes mag-
nesium calcite with 0.04 to 0.32 mol% magnesium; Acineto-
bacter produces magnesium calcite with up to 14% aragonite at
the highest salinities (69). Similarly, 63 strains of Salinivibrio
isolated from an inland saltern in Spain were found to beinvolved in crystal formation (279).
Bacteriophages
Like other prokaryotes, the aerobic moderately halophilic
bacteria have bacteriophages. Few attempts have been made toquantitatively assess the occurrence of phages in hypersalineenvironments inhabited by halophilic bacteria and to estimatetheir importance in the regulation of the community density oftheir host organisms. Studies in which these bacteriophages areexploited to investigate the genetics of their hosts are lackingaltogether.
Induction of lysogenic phages by mitomycin C led to the
isolation of phage F9-11 from an H. halophila strain obtained
from soil. This phage replicates over a wide range of salinities(2.5 to 15%) (20, 92).
A water sample from Lake Chaplin, Canada, produced a
bacteriophage that lysed a bacterium designated Pseudomonas
strain G3, which is able to grow from 0.25 to ove r 3 M NaCl.
The phage also infects S. costicola and two unidentiﬁed halo-
philic bacteria and is stable in the absence of salt (150). An-other phage (designated UTAK) active against an S. costicola
strain was isolated from the salterns of Alicante, Spain. Theburst size of this phage was maximal at 1 t o 2 M NaCl (80 to
105 phages per cell) and decreased to an average of only 12.5phages per cell at 0.5 M. It was thus suggested that intracellularphage replication may be controlled by the salinity of themedium (96). Additional bacteriophages were isolated fromthe saltern in the course of this study, attacking morphologi-cally different hosts, but most of these phages were not studiedfurther.
Two phages lysing Tetragenococcus halophilus involved in
soy sauce fermentation were characterized: phages f7116, hav-VOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 515ing an isometric head and a contractile tail, and fD-86, having
an isometric head and a noncontractile tail. Both could prop-agate at all salinities in which their host could grow. PhagefD-86 was stable at all salinities between 0.03 and 2.6 M, while
phage f7116 was speciﬁcally unstable between 0.04 and 0.1 M
salt while being stable in both the lower (0.01 to 0.03 M) andthe higher (0.2 to 2.6 M) salt range. This effect, which is knownfor other (nonhalophilic) phages as well, is probably due to thesalting-in effect of Na
1, causing destruction of phage protein
and DNA-protein complexes (331).
Cultures of Actinopolyspora halophila grown on low-salt me-
dia (10 to 12%, near the lower limit required for growth)showed holes resembling viral plaques (95). This phenomenonwas not investigated further.
All bacteriophages isolated thus far from the moderate halo-
philes are double-stranded DNA phages with distinct headsand tails. Most are almost equally stable in the presence andthe absence of salt and can retain infectivity for weeks in dilutesolutions (151), in contrast to the halophilic archaeal phages,which, similar to their hosts, are inactivated in the absence ofsalt. The bacterial phages are “halophilic” only to the extentthat their hosts are: the phages multiply only when the halo-philic host is growing. In view of the relatively low salt con-centration within the cytoplasm of halophilic bacteria com-pared to the outside medium (see below), the process ofattachment and infection of the host cells may occur at highsalt concentrations while intracellular multiplication occurs ina low-salt medium (151).
Another approach to obtain information on the role that
bacteriophages may play in regulating the community sizes ofhalophilic bacteria in nature is based on direct electron micro-scopic observation and enumeration of phages in environmen-tal samples. This approach was used in a study of Spanishsalterns of different salinities (104). While many infected cells(probably of halophilic archaea) were seen at salinities above25%, infected cells were not observed in the lower salinityrange. At the lower salinities, bacterivory by protozoa was es-timated to be much more important than phage lysis. In thelower salinity range (up to about 15%) around 1 310
7to 23
107bacterial cells and 5 3107to 73107virus-like particles,
most of them with icosahedral heads, were counted per ml ofbrine. Viral abundance, as well as prokaryote abundance, in-creased with salinity. Also in the Dead Sea, virus-like particles(head and tail or spindle-shaped) were abundantly found. Inview of the dominance of halophilic archaea in the lake, thesevirus-like particles were most probably derived from lysis ofarchaea, but the possibility that bacterial viruses were involvedcannot be ruled out (249).
Another factor which may cause a decrease in halophilic
bacterial numbers, in addition to lysis by bacteriophages andpredation by protozoa, is the existence of halophilic predatorybacteria of the genus Bdellovibrio . With Vibrio parahaemolyti-
cusand V. alginolyticus as hosts, halophilic Bdellovibrio strains
that grew from 1 to 15.5% salt were isolated (303). Thus, pred-atory bacteria should also be considered as potential regulatorsof the halophilic bacterial community size in nature.
PHYSIOLOGY
Requirement for Salt
The common denominator for all moderately halophilic bac-
teria is their requirement for salt and their ability to toleratehigh salt concentrations. Salt requirement and tolerance arehighly variable among the different species. Moreover, theseparameters are by no means constant, since they may varyaccording to the growth temperature and the nature of the
nutrients available (174). The salinity range of many isolateshas been investigated in complex media. This fact led to theclassiﬁcation of some organisms as halotolerant rather thanhalophilic. Thus, H. elongata was originally described as ex-
tremely halotolerant (357). However, in minimal medium itrequires at least 0.5 M NaCl, thus behaving like a true halo-phile (23). An examination of the speciﬁc requirement for Na
1
and Cl2ions, as well as the tolerance toward other salts, is also
necessary. In most cases, a minimum concentration of Na1is
essential for growth. This may be due in part to the require-ment for Na
1gradients to drive transport processes in the cell
membrane. Certain species may also possess a primary respi-ration-driven outward sodium pump (see below). S. costicola
(optimal growth at 0.8 to 1.5 M NaCl, and growing up to 3.3 Min a peptone-based complex medium) had a minimum require-ment for 0.5 M NaCl in media based on NaCl as the sole salt.Addition of high concentrations of compounds such as glucoseor glycerol lowered the NaCl requirement to 0.3 M, but nofurther lowering of the sodium concentration required wasachieved (1). Other cations may be tolerated in high concen-trations. Thus, “ Micrococcus varians subsp. halophilus ” can
grow in 1.5 t o 2 M LiCl, RbCl, or CsCl in the presence of 60
mM Na
1(146). There does not seem to be an absolute re-
quirement for Cl2ions: H. elongata grew as well on NaBr and
NaNO3(but not on NaI or Na2SO4) as on NaCl (358). H. halo-
phila grew well on NaCl, NaBr, Na2SO4and Na2S2O3but not
on other sodium salts (264). The moderately halophilic Pseu-
domonas sp. strain 40 can grow in 1 to 4 M NaCl, 1 to 2 M
NaNO3,o r1MN a2SO4but not in 1 to 4 M KCl (238).
Salt requirement and tolerance may be temperature depen-
dent. In certain halophilic archaea such as Haloferax volcanii ,
the minimum and optimum salt concentrations shifted to high-er values with increasing temperature (219), and a similar phe-nomenon was observed in halophilic bacteria as well. Thus, theoptimum salt concentration for growth of H. halophila at 32
and 42°C was 7.5%, whereas the optimal concentration forgrowth at 22°C was 5% (264). H. elongata grew in complex
medium at 20 and 30°C at salt concentrations between 0.05 and3.4 M. At 40°C, no growth was obtained at 0.05 M, but growthwas possible between 0.375 and 4.5 M. In deﬁned medium withglucose and alanine as organic nutrients, salt tolerance was de-creased, growth occurred within a narrower salt range than incomplex medium, and a higher salt concentration was neededfor optimum growth (358).
Marinococcus halophilus (NaCl range, 0 to 5.5 M; optimum,
1 M at 35°C) grew in the virtual absence of NaCl at 20°C. At25°C, at least 0.5 M was required and could not be replaced byKCl or by nonionic solutes (168, 171, 174, 227, 228). Somewhatdifferent behavior was observed in S. costicola (optimum, 1 M
NaCl at 30°C): at higher or lower growth temperatures, boththe optimum and the lower limit of NaCl concentrations werehigher (3). While at 30°C cells grew from 0.5 t o 5 M salt, at
20°C 0.2 M salt was sufﬁcient for growth. This lower limit couldnot be reduced further (168, 171). Many halophiles may thusprove to grow at a wider range of NaCl concentrations whentested at a greater range of temperatures.
Minimal and Deﬁned Media
Many of the moderately halophilic bacteria have simple
growth requirements, and minimum growth requirements havebeen determined for several species. Thus, H. halophila grows
well on a medium containing inorganic salts, including nitrateas the nitrogen source, and glucose as the only carbon andenergy source (264). H. halodenitriﬁcans could grow aerobi-516 VENTOSA ET AL. MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.cally on any of a number of organic carbon sources in the pres-
ence of thiamine. Under anaerobic conditions (with nitrate asthe electron acceptor), methionine had to be supplied as well.Methionine could be replaced by glycine betaine or by vitaminB
12but not by dimethylglycine. It was suggested that the bac-
terium may be deﬁcient in the cobalamine-dependent path formethionine synthesis and is therefore unable to produce gly-cine betaine anaerobically (126). However, H. halodenitriﬁcans
also produces ectoine as compatible solute anaerobically andcannot synthesize glycine betaine de novo (83); hence, thisexplanation for the effect of methionine may not be valid.S. costicola has more complex growth requirements. The ear-
liest designed synthetic medium contained glucose,
L-cysteine
or cystine, glutamate, arginine, valine, isoleucine, and salts(70). Glucose, cyst(e)ine, and NaCl were essential, and omis-sion of any of the other components led to decreased growth.A simpler formulation was based on glucose, glutamate, twovitamins (biotin and thiamine), choline (as a precursor of gly-cine betaine), and salts (148).
Most moderate halophiles have more demanding nutritional
requirements at high salt concentrations. Complex media stim-ulate growth at high salt concentrations. The effect may be dueto the presence of compatible solutes or their precursors thatcan be accumulated or to the fact that other growth factorsmay be synthesized more slowly under the high-salt conditions(136). Thus, the salt tolerance of S. costicola in deﬁned me-
dium could be extended by including 2% sodium glutamate(148), and its growth i n 4 M (but not in 3 M) salt required the
presence of nutrients such as glycine betaine (296). The widestsalt range for growth was found in proteose peptone and tryp-tone medium, Casamino Acids alone gave a narrower range(0.4–2.5 M), while in a deﬁned medium no growth was ob-tained above 2.2 to 2.3 M (71).
Tolerance to Heavy Metal Ions
Surveys of heavy metal sensitivity and tolerance to 10 heavy
metal ions in moderate halophiles (224), both from culturecollection strains and from fresh isolates, showed a very het-erogeneous response among the taxonomic groups (the Halo-
monas group, Acinetobacter ,Flavobacterium , moderately halo-
philic cocci), as well as among the strains included in eachgroup. All were sensitive to mercury, silver, and zinc and tol-erant to lead. The response to arsenic, cadmium, chromium, andcopper was very heterogeneous. Acinetobacter strains proved
the most metal tolerant, and Flavobacterium strains were the
most sensitive. The inﬂuence of salinity and yeast extract con-centrations in the test medium on the toxicity of the heavymetals tested was also examined. In general, lowering the sa-linity led to enhanced sensitivity to cadmium and, in somecases, to cobalt and copper. However, increasing the salinityresulted in a decrease only in the cadmium, copper, and nickeltoxicities. Reduction in the yeast extract concentration resultedin an increased sensitivity to all metals, but only a slight de-crease in the toxicities of nickel and zinc was found when theyeast extract concentration was increased (224).
Different S. costicola strains were compared for heavy metal
tolerance. All proved sensitive to cadmium, copper, silver, zinc,and mercury. All tolerated lead, and most were also tolerant tonickel and chromium, so that multiple tolerance to the threemetal ions chromium, nickel, and lead emerged as the majorpattern (90). On the basis of these studies, several metal con-centrations were proposed to discriminate between heavy met-al-tolerant strains and those that were sensitive (222), therebyfacilitating the isolation of metal-tolerant strains from pollutedhypersaline habitats. In a recent study, the isolation and taxo-nomic characterization of a large number of heavy metal-tol-
erant halophilic strains from different geographical sites inSpain has been attempted. A total of 222 metal-tolerant (tomercury, cadmium, copper, chromium, or zinc) moderatelyhalophilic strains were selected for a detailed taxonomic anal-ysis. Most isolates were assigned to the genus Halomonas , and
approximately 30% of the strains displayed multiple resis-tances (278).
Salinity-dependent cadmium tolerance was documented in
Pseudomonas sp. strain 40. I n 1 M NaCl, poor growth was ob-
tained in the presence of 2 mg of CdCl
2per ml and no growth
was possible at 2.5 mg/ml. However, in 2 t o 4 M NaCl and 2.5
mg of CdCl2per ml, moderate growth was observed. NaNO3
and Na2SO4enhanced cadmium toxicity. Cadmium ions react
with chloride ions to form complexes whose nature depends onthe chloride concentration: a t 1 M NaCl, most of the cadmium
appears as a mixture of CdCl
2(35%) and CdCl32(45%); at
2 M NaCl, the anionic complexes CdCl32(47%) and CdCl422
(33%) predominate and are probably less toxic (238).
Internal Ion Concentrations
To cope with the high and often changing salinity of their
environment, the aerobic halophilic bacteria, similar to all oth-er microorganisms, need to balance their cytoplasm with theosmotic pressure exerted by the external medium.
Osmotic balance can be achieved by the accumulation of
salts, organic molecules, or a combination thereof. A fourthpossibility, that the cell is able to control water movement inand out and maintain a hypoosmotic state of their intracellularspace, has been proposed for S. costicola andH. elongata (308,
351, 359).
Much of the controversy in the literature about the nature of
the real intracellular environment of the halophilic bacteriaoriginates from the difﬁculties in the estimation of the cellvolume. Intracellular solute concentrations are generally de-termined by analysis of cell pellets and thus depend on theprecise assessment of what fraction of the pellet volume is oc-cupied by the intracellular space. Volume determinations arebased mostly on the distribution of radioactive marker mole-cules labeling the total water space, the water space excludingthe cytoplasm, and the water space excluding the whole cellvolume, including the outer layers and periplasmic space (133).Cell-impermeable markers that have been successfully used sofar include inulin (105, 193, 308, 359), dextran (46, 203, 298),and blue dextran (146). Permeable solutes such as tritiatedwater or ethylene glycol are also used to calculate the totalwater space in the cell pellets (170). An exact determination ofthe intracellular and extracellular water spaces is essential.Errors are especially large for sodium and chloride, which aregenerally abundant in the medium, and thus a small error inthe determination of the spaces results in a large error in theirapparent concentrations. Accurate estimation of the cytoplas-mic volume also suffers from the lack of reliable methods todifferentiate between the periplasmic space and the osmoti-cally active cytoplasmic space (133). Small molecules such asrafﬁnose (105), sorbitol, and sucrose (308), which have beenused in this type of experiment, can be expected to penetratethe outer membrane and become distributed in the periplasmicspace as well. This periplasmic space can have a considerablesize: in S. costicola , it was estimated to occupy 38% of the total
cellular space (308). All calculations are based on the (notnecessarily true) assumption that the molecules used as mark-ers are not taken up and metabolized by the cells or bound tothe envelopes and other cellular structures. Indeed, it wassuggested that dextran and inulin may bind to cell envelopesVOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 517(130) and that smaller fragments of unpuriﬁed dextran may be
taken up by the cells, causing large errors in the calculation ofthe cytoplasmic solute concentrations. That a proper knowl-edge of the intracellular water space under different growthconditions is essential and that a comparative approach based,e.g., on the ion content per unit of cell protein is insufﬁcient isclearly shown by the ﬁnding that in H. elongata the cell volume
per unit of protein is inversely related to salinity, decreasingfrom 2.62 to 2.06 ml/mg of protein in cells grown from 0.175 to
1.37 M NaCl (203). A similar phenomenon was observed inH. canadensis : cells grown at 0.6 M NaCl had a volume of 4.94
ml/mg of protein, decreasing to 2.69 ml/mg of protein at 4.35 M
(193).
During the analysis of cell pellets obtained by centrifugation,
anaerobic conditions may develop in the densely packed cellsduring handling and washing, potentially leading to loss ofsubstantial amounts of potassium and gain in the amount ofsodium (308). The effect is reversible: when dense cell suspen-sions of S. costicola were aerated in the presence of an energy
source, potassium ions were taken up while sodium was re-leased (168). Perhaps variations in harvesting and handlingmay explain the differences in the estimated intracellular ionconcentrations in H. halodenitriﬁcans as published by different
authors (31, 298) (Table 5). Centrifugation of cells through alayer of silicone oil may avoid some of the problems involvedin conventional centrifugation techniques. Oils of differentdensities must be used to adjust for the density of the cells,which depends on the salt concentration of the medium (171).The method has not been widely applied in the study of mod-erate halophiles. A different approach toward the estimation ofintracellular ion concentrations, yet to be applied to the aero-bic halophilic bacteria, is the use of X-ray microanalysis in theelectron microscope. This method, in which individual cells areanalyzed, was recently used to measure ion contents in thehalophilic anaerobe Haloanaerobium praevalens (252).
The phase of growth can also have a major inﬂuence on the
results of the internal ion concentration measurements; sta-tionary-phase cells may have a much higher intracellular so-dium concentration than exponentially growing cells. This mayalso explain some of the unusually high apparent intracellularsodium concentrations reported in the literature.
Table 5 summarizes some of the reported estimates of in-
tracellular ion concentrations of halophilic bacteria. Most anal-yses are limited to Na
1and K1, intracellular Cl2concentra-
tions have seldom been determined, and data on divalentcations are scarce. Great variations in the intracellular ionconcentrations are obvious, both among different species ofmoderate halophiles and within the same species, dependingon the growth conditions and on the method used. A fewgeneral trends are clear, however (176). (i) The intracellularK
1concentration is generally higher than that in the medium.
(ii) The Na1concentration inside the cells is generally lower
(to different extents) than that outside. (iii) The apparent in-tracellular Na
1and K1concentrations increase with increas-
ing external NaCl concentration in a nonlinear fashion. (iv)Generally the sum of the concentrations measured is insufﬁ-cient to balance the osmotic pressure of the medium. However,taking into account the presence of organic osmotic solutes aswell (see below), such a balance may be achieved.
In certain gram-positive bacteria, the apparent intracellular
cation concentrations are similar to those of the growth me-dium. This was reported for the haloalkaliphilic Bacillus halo-
alkaliphilus (361). However, the reported value of 0.37 g of
intracellular water per g (dry weight) is rather high and mayoverestimate the cytoplasmic ion concentrations. Moreover,this strain produces ectoine and other yet unknown organicosmotic solutes (83). In “ Micrococcus varians subsp. halophi-
lus,” the apparent intracellular Na
1concentration was approx-
imately equal to that in the medium over the range from 1to 2 M, while in cells grown a t 4 M NaCl, 2.1 M Na
1was
measured intracellularly (28). The presence of high intracellu-lar Na
1concentrations in this organism was conﬁrmed by
Kamekura and coworkers, who also showed that other mono-valent cations added to the growth medium (K
1,L i1,R b1,
and Cs1) were not excluded from the cytoplasm (146, 176).
In many Halomonas species ( H. elongata ,H. canadensis , and
H. halodenitriﬁcans ), the sum of the apparent intracellular Na1
and K1concentrations is much lower than the medium con-
centration. In H. halodenitriﬁcans , the sum of intracellular Na1
and K1concentrations remained low and constant (about 0.1
MN a1and 0.3 M K1in exponentially growing cells) over a
wide range of medium NaCl concentrations. In stationary-phase cells, a drastic increase in the intracellular Na
1concen-
tration was observed (up to 0.5 and 1.1 M in cells grown in 1and 3 M NaCl, respectively) and the intracellular K

atively independent of the salt concentration in which the cellswere grown, but in this organism the measured sum of theintracellular concentrations was quite high (1.4 to 1.9 M Na
1
1K1in cells grown between 1 an d 3 M NaCl) (192). In
S. costicola , the intracellular Na11K1concentration was
signiﬁcantly lower than outside only at the highest mediumsalinities. However, upon treatment with cetyltrimethylammo-nium bromide, the cellular Na
1and K1concentrations did not
equilibrate with the external medium, possibly indicating thatthe ions may partially occur in a bound state (308).
Below we summarize a few data on the intracellular abun-
dance of individual ions.
(i) Sodium. The apparent intracellular Na
1concentrations
are often far too high to enable the generally salt-sensitivecytoplasmic enzymes to be active (see below). However, theassessment of the true intracellular Na
1concentration is prob-
lematic, as discussed above. In addition, Na1and other ions
may be bound to the outer cell layers, in amounts increasingwith external salinity (133). It was thus suggested that much ofthe cell-associated Na
1in “P. halosaccharolytica ” is not cyto-
plasmic (192).
(ii) Potassium. In most halophilic bacteria, K1is accumu-
lated to a few tenths o f 1 M (133). H. elongata seems to be an
exception, with K1concentrations as low as 20 mM (359). In
any case, in contrast to some archaeal halophiles, cytoplasmicpotassium contributes relatively little to the achievement of anosmotic balance.
(iii) Magnesium. Intracellular Mg
21concentrations have
been determined only seldom in halophilic bacteria. In H. elon-
gata grown in medium containing 24 mM Mg21, the intracel-
lular Mg21concentrations varied from 9 to 23 mM depending
on the growth conditions (359), which is not particularly highcompared to 30 mM in Escherichia coli and 102 mM in
Halobacterium salinarum (cutirubrum ) (45, 46).
(iv) Calcium. H. elongata , growing in media with 0.7 mM
Ca
21and in the presence of 0.05 to 3.4 M NaCl, was reported
to contain between 3.1 and 12 mM Ca21intracellularly, most
of it probably bound (353).
(v) Manganese. A single measurement of intracellular Mn21
concentrations in S. costicola (by using54Mn added to the
medium as label) gave a value of 0.6 mM Mn21/kg of cell water
(46).
(vi) Chloride. Estimations of intracellular chloride concen-
trations within cells of moderately halophilic bacteria are great-ly variable, from relatively low values (55 and 139 mM inH. halodenitriﬁcans andS. costicola , respectively, grown in 1 M
NaCl) (31) to values as high as 0.7 t o1Mi n“ P. halosaccha-
rolytica ” grown at NaCl concentrations between 1 and 3 M
(192). The measured intracellular Cl
2concentrations are in
most cases much lower than the combined Na1and K1con-
centrations (133). Thus, S. costicola grown i n 1 M NaCl and 6
mM KCl will have a combined intracellular Na1and K1con-
centration of about 0.6 M but only about 0.1 to 0.2 M Cl2
(171). When the cells are grown at higher salt concentrations,the apparent intracellular Cl
2concentration may be increased
(1.5 M in cells grown in 3 M) (141). The old assumption thatCl
2is the main counterion for the intracellular cations in
moderate halophiles is not necessarily true, and since no otheranions have been detected at high concentrations within thecells, it has been speculated that most of the cellular cationsmay be associated with negative charges present on proteins,cell envelopes, and other macromolecules (170–172).
To verify the theory that part of the Na
1and other cations
may be tightly bound to different cellular structures, bulk anal-ysis of ions is insufﬁcient (160). Indications that a signiﬁcantfraction of the intracellular Na
1does not occur freely dis-
solved in the cytoplasm but is rather strongly bound, camefrom a number of studies in which
23Na nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR) was used to obtain informa-tion on the state of the Na
1ions. Sodium NMR relaxation
times can indicate changes in the intracellular environment inwhich the Na
1is embedded. The need for thick cell suspen-
sions, easily leading to the development of anoxic conditions, isa problem inherent in this method (94). By using NMR toprobe the ionic environment inside H. israelensis cells, three
types of cell-associated Na
1were detected. One fraction
(about 40% of the total) is free, dissolved in the cytosol, andcan exchange with the extracellular Na
1. The other 60% is
bound; part of it could exchange with the “free” intracellularNa
1, while another part could not exchange and was “invisi-
ble” to the NMR. Since the shift reagent [dysprosium bis(tri-polyphosphate)] used to discriminate between extracellularand cell-associated Na
1was not effective at the highest NaCl
concentrations, the approach could be applied up to about 2 Msalt only. In the concentration range tested, the “NMR-visible”intracellular Na
1concentration never exceeded 15 to 20% of
the medium concentration (97, 299). It should be noted thatthe use of shift reagents may lead to faulty results as they formcomplexes and therefore disturb the equilibrium across themembrane.
The state of intracellular lithium was also investigated by
NMR. Li
1can replace part of the intracellular Na1. The
interaction of Li1ions with the bacteria is different in cells
grown in high salt and in low salt: in low salt (0.5 M), almost all(92%) of the Li
1was “seen” by the NMR, while in 3 M
salt-grown cells, only 55% of the Li1was detected. Goldberg et
al. suggested that three types of Li1ions existed: free, weakly
bound, and strongly bound (98).
NMR methods were also applied to study S. costicola grown
at NaCl concentrations between 0.6 and 2 M. Apparent intra-cellular Na
1concentrations (excluding strongly bound Na1
which is not detected by the NMR) were always below 25% ofthe medium concentration (94). It was calculated that thefraction of the free intracellular Na
1was about 40% of the
total, which yielded an estimate of the total intracellular Na1
concentrations as being between 0.14 and 0.435 M (94), muchlower than those obtained by bulk analyses in cell pellets (308).
Additional evidence for a substantial binding of Na
1ions to
cellular structures came from a study in which cell envelopes of“P. halosaccharolytica ” were incubated i n 2 M NaCl and 5.5
mM KCl. It was found that 149 mg of Na
1and 14 mg of K1
were bound per g of protein, about twice as much Na1and
eight times less K1as found per gram of protein in whole cells
(192).
It has often been speculated whether the exclusion of salt
and the maintenance of a steep ionic gradient by the moder-ately halophilic bacteria is achieved through the constantpumping of ions by active, energy-dependent mechanisms (seebelow) or by tightening of the permeability barrier of themembrane. This important question does not seem to havebeen pursued in depth. Continuous-culture experiments withH. elongata strongly indicate that the maintenance energy of
these organisms is relatively independent of the salinity of themedium, providing evidence in favor of an ion-tight membrane(82).
Ion Pumps in the Cell Membranes
A low intracellular ionic environment can be achieved only
by energy-dependent mechanisms. This was recognized asearly as 1954 by Baxter and Gibbons: “...adaptation at theVOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 519cellular level, in a mechanism that is probably energy-depen-
dent that maintains the intracellular salt concentration at alevel considerably below that of the environment” (9).
To achieve low intracellular Na
1ion concentrations against
a constant inﬂux of Na1ions leaking inside through a not
completely impermeable membrane, in addition to Na1enter-
ing the cells during cotransport with amino acids and othersubstrates (see below), mechanisms of Na
1extrusion have to
be present in the cell membrane. Two possible mechanismshave been suggested: activity of Na
1/H1antiport and presence
of a primary respiration-driven Na1pump. It is generally ac-
cepted that Na1/H1antiport activity is an important mecha-
nism for maintaining low intracellular sodium concentrations.The Na
1/H1antiporter activity of S. costicola has been rela-
tively well studied (105, 106, 332). However, there is still con-siderably controversy about the occurrence and relative impor-tance of primary Na
1pumps in different representatives of the
very heterogeneous group of moderate halophiles. S. costicola
cells maintain a proton motive force (the combined action ofthe pH gradient over the membrane and the membrane po-tential) varying from 170 to 100 mV (inside negative) in cellsgrown at pH values varying from 5.7 to 9.0. Cells maintain theirintracellular pH close to 7.5, and thus the reversed pH gradientis compensated at least in part by an increased membranepotential at high medium pH. The primary respiration-drivenoutward proton pump supplies the driving force for the Na
1/
H1antiport activity for Na1efﬂux. Protonophores, such as car-
bonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and 3,3 9,49,4-
tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS), respiration inhibitors, and mo-nensin, which facilitates Na
1/H1exchange, dissipate the pro-
ton motive force, thereby abolishing Na1/H1antiport activity
(105). When S. costicola cells, kept anaerobically at pH 6.5,
were given a pulse of oxygen, protons were extruded, both inthe presence and in the absence of Na
1ions. At pH 8.5, an
acidic response was observed in absence of Na1but alkalin-
ization was noted in its presence, suggesting that an Na1/H1
antiport mechanism is functional at pH 8.5 and that the estab-lishment of an Na
1gradient participates in pH homeostasis.
All these effects are abolished by protonophores. At pH 8.5,growth is prevented by CCCP (at the rather high concentrationof 50 mM [see below]) and by TCS (106). During growth on
lactate as the energy source, Na
1translocation in S. costicola
was inhibited by CCCP but little affected by valinomycin.Amiloride, an inhibitor of the eukaryotic Na
1/H1antiporter
system, inhibited lactate-dependent Na1translocation. It was
concluded that lactate-dependent H1extrusion enables the
generation of a Na1gradient mediated by the secondary
Na1/H1antiporter (332). All of the evidence reviewed above
supports the idea that H1extrusion is the primary process,
enabling the secondary conversion of the proton motive forceinto a sodium motive force via the antiporter.
However, primary Na
1pumps have been postulated to be
involved in the extrusion of Na1from certain moderate halo-
philes ever since the ﬁrst respiration-driven Na1pumps were
identiﬁed in Vibrio alginolyticus and the moderate halophile
S. costicola (328). The evidence for the existence of such a
pump is based in part on the fact that growth of this organismin alkaline media is not inhibited by the protonophore CCCP.Thus, growth was postulated to occur in the absence of protoncirculation across the cell membrane. The Na
1-speciﬁc pump,
with an optimum in the alkaline pH range, then maintains theintracellular cation environment, in addition to the Na
1/H1
antiporter, which is operative at low pH (328). The primaryoutward Na
1pump in S. costicola was identiﬁed to be the
NADH oxidase (NADH:quinone reductase) segment of therespiratory chain. At pH 8.5, the formation of a membrane po-tential was inhibited by 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (NQNO),
which inhibits the Na-motive NADH oxidase. When NADHserved as electron donor, Na
1translocation was resistant to
CCCP and stimulated by valinomycin (as noted above, whenlactate was used as the electron donor, Na
1translocation was
inhibited by CCCP and little affected by valinomycin). Amilo-ride had little effect on NADH-dependent Na
1translocation
(332).
In a comparative study of eight moderate halophiles, all six
gram-negative species tested ( H. variabilis ,H. halophila ,H. cana-
densis ,S. costicola ,“P. beijerinckii ,” and “ P. halosaccharolytica ”)
showed Na1-dependent NADH:quinone reductase activity.
Buildup of a membrane potential linked to NADH oxidationin inverted membrane vesicles was not completely inhibited byCCCP alone but was abolished by a combination of CCCP andthe Na
1-conducting ionophore monensin. Succinate oxidation
and the terminal oxidase step of the respiratory chain did notshow any speciﬁc requirement for Na
1ions. No Na1-depen-
dent NADH oxidase could be demonstrated in the gram-pos-itive Marinococcus halophilus and “ Micrococcus varians subsp.
halophilus ,” since in these organisms the membrane potential
generated during NADH oxidation was completely dissipatedby CCCP (334). However, Nikolayev and Matveyeva (225) alsopostulated the presence of a primary Na
1pump in “ Micrococ-
cus varians subsp. halophilus ,” based on the low level of inhi-
bition of alanine transport by CCCP at alkaline pH.
Extensive studies on ion metabolism in H. israelensis also
suggested the importance of a primary Na1pump in the reg-
ulation of intracellular Na1concentrations (152–154, 156).
The presence of an uncoupler-stimulated Na1pump was pos-
tulated to explain the drop in respiration rate of up to 80%observed when the pH was increased from 6.5 to 8.5 in the ab-sence of Na
1. Catalytic amounts of Na1prevented this drop.
The rate-limiting step in the electron transport at high pH waslocated in the NADH-oxidoreductase section of the respira-tory chain, and Na
1was suggested to release the kinetic con-
trol (152). In the presence of Na1, a pH gradient of reversed
polarity was formed, in both the absence and presence of theuncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-triﬂuoromethoxyphenylhydra-
zone (FCCP), driven by the Na
1/H1antiport activity. Inverted
membrane vesicles responded as expected from the behaviorof intact cells. It was concluded that extrusion of Na
1ions is
the primary event and that proton counterﬂow and Na1/anion
symport phenomena are secondary events which minimize thebuildup of a membrane potential generated by the primaryNa
1pump (156). Respiration initiates efﬂux of Na1from
preloaded cells, driven by an Na1pump insensitive to uncou-
plers such as FCCP and the ATPase inhibitor N,N9-dicy-
clohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) (153, 154). Movement of Na1
is thus directly coupled to electron transport. The uncoupler-insensitive primary Na
1pump may play an important role in
the regulation of intracellular salt concentrations.
When K1ions were omitted from the medium, a shift in pH
from 6.5 to 8.5 caused an increase in respiration rate inH. israelensis , in contrast to the above-described drop in res-
piration in the absence of Na
1. When both Na1and K1were
present, the pH did not affect the respiration rate (152). Stim-ulation of respiration by K
1was most pronounced at acidic pH
and was accompanied by an alkalinization of the cytoplasm.The effect of K
1was observed only in intact cells. Possibly to
compensate for the electrogenic entry of K1, more protons are
extruded by the primary proton pump, leading to internal al-kalinization. The step in the electron ﬂux affected by K
1has
not yet been identiﬁed (152).
MacLeod (184) suggested an alternative explanation not
involving a primary respiration-driven Na1pump for at least520 VENTOSA ET AL. MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.part of the observations presented above. Many of the conclu-
sions relating to the nature of the ion pumps are based on theeffect of ionophores such as CCCP on cells or membranepreparations. What is often not taken into account is thatCCCP functions poorly at alkaline pH and may be altogetherineffective in complex media containing such ingredients asproteose peptone and tryptone. Cells in complex media maynot be inhibited by high CCCP concentrations, while 5 mM
CCCP causes complete growth inhibition in deﬁned medium(106). The fact that CCCP causes only a partial collapse of themembrane potential in S. costicola at high pH (328) may thus
be due to the ineffectiveness of this protonophore under theconditions used. In S. costicola , CCCP proved effective at high-
er concentrations and TCS was almost as effective at pH 8.5 asat pH 7 (106). MacLeod therefore suggested that NADH ox-idation at pH 8.5 in S. costicola leads to proton extrusion,
which drives the formation of a membrane potential throughan Na
1/H1antiporter, and he argued that no compelling ev-
idence exists that a protonophore-resistant primary electro-genic Na
1pump operates in S. costicola at alkaline pH (184).
To our knowledge, the above studies have not been pursuedrecently, and therefore the question of the relative importanceof Na
1/H1antiporters and primary respiration-driven Na1
pumps in the extrusion of sodium and the maintenance of lowintracellular Na
1concentrations in moderately halophilic bac-
teria remains unanswered.
Little information is available on transport systems for other
inorganic ions in the moderate halophiles. A K1transport
system was characterized in a Halomonas strain isolated as a
contaminant from a Dunaliella culture, enabling cells to accu-
mulate the necessary K1concentration following a hyperos-
motic shock. The Ksof the transporter was 21.5 mM; thus, its
afﬁnity is lower than that of the well-characterized Kdp systemofE. coli . However, high-afﬁnity K
1transport systems are
probably not essential for Halomonas and other moderately
halophilic bacteria, which generally live in seawater-derivedbrines, in which K
1can hardly be considered limiting (36). A
potassium extrusion system was described in H. israelensis ,
probably based on a K1/H1antiporter. K1and Rb1ions were
found to rapidly penetrate the cell membrane. Under ener-gized conditions, a powerful pump extrudes this K
1and Rb1.
At low pH values, the presence of Na1is not required for K1
extrusion. However, millimolar concentrations of Na1are
needed for effective K1and Rb1extrusion at high pH values,
again possibly pointing to the involvement of primary Na1
pumps. The K1pump was postulated to have a function in the
regulation of intracellular salt concentrations and/or internalpH (310).
Little is known about the mechanisms of extrusion of anions
from the cells of moderately halophilic bacteria. No informa-tion was found in the literature beyond the assumption that themembrane potential generated by Na
1efﬂux may be the driv-
ing force causing efﬂux of permeant anions (153, 154).
Transport of Organic Compounds
The most widely studied transport system in moderate halo-
philes is the transport of a-aminoisobutyrate (AIB), a nonme-
tabolizable amino acid analog. In S. costicola , AIB transport is
competitively inhibited by Gly, Ala, and to a lesser extent Met(107, 108). In H. elongata , competition was observed with Ala,
Gly, Ser,
D-Ala, L-homoserine, and D-Ser and to a lesser extent
with Met, Leu, Phe, and His (190). The transport activity isNa
1dependent. Sodium at concentrations below 0.2 M in-
creased the apparent afﬁnity of the S. costicola transport sys-
tem. NaCl concentrations between 0.2 an d 1 M increased theVmax, while at NaCl concentrations above 1 M, the Vmaxde-
creased without affecting the Km(107, 108). In cells grown in
the presence of 1 o r 2 M NaCl, AIB transport was active at
higher salinities than in cells grown in 0.5 M NaCl. Low-salt-grown cells adapted to AIB transport at high salinities after 6 hof incubation at high salt in a process independent of proteinsynthesis (175). A similar phenomenon was reported forH. elongata , which showed optimum AIB uptake at an NaCl
concentration of 0.38 M in low-salt-grown cells and 1.37 M inhigh-salt-grown cells (190, 296). Adaptation of AIB transportinS. costicola to the highest salinities (4 M NaCl) required the
presence of nutrients, probably related to the accumulation ofcompatible solutes, and glycine betaine was especially stimu-latory (172, 175). Transport showed an optimum at pH 8.5 to9 and required the presence of Na
1and a membrane potential
(107, 108, 183). Na1was required for AIB transport in all the
gram-negative bacteria in which a respiration-driven primaryNa
1pump was demonstrated ( H. halophila ,H. canadensis ,
H. variabilis ,S. costicola ,“P. beijerinckii ,” and “ P. halosaccha-
rolytica ”), while two gram-positive bacteria lacking the respi-
ration-driven Na1pump ( Micrococcus halophilus and “ M. vari-
anssubsp. halophilus ”) did not require Na1for AIB uptake
(333).
NaCl caused a two- to threefold stimulation of the transport
activity of proline in H. israelensis . As in the case of AIB
transport in S. costicola and H. elongata , the maximum uptake
rate of proline was observed at salt concentrations similar tothose at which the cells were grown (257).
Transport of different amino acids was compared in a variety
of moderate halophiles by Nikolayev et al. (225, 226). In S. cos-
ticola ,Nesterenkonia halobia , and H. halodenitriﬁcans , all
amino acid transport was found to be Na
1dependent, but in
some cases Li1,K1,N H41,o rC s1could replace Na1.I n
S. costicola transport of Asp in the presence of Li1was 10% of
that with Na1, while Ala transport was strictly Na1dependent.
For Arg transport, K1,N H41, and Cs1could replace Na1to
different degrees. In H. halodenitriﬁcans , Arg transport in the
presence of Li1,N H41,o rK1was only 1.5 to 2 times lower
than when Na1was present. Asp, Arg, and Ala could be
transported by “ M. varians subsp. halophilus ” at salt concen-
trations of up to 2 M. The transport of Asp and Arg wasinhibited by NaCl, while that of Ala was stimulated (226).
Organic Osmotic Solutes
Since the intracellular ion concentrations measured in the
moderate halophiles are generally insufﬁcient to provide os-motic balance with the external medium, much effort has beendedicated to the search for organic compounds accumulated bythe cells. Only relatively recently were the principal organicosmotic solutes of the moderately halophilic bacteria identi-ﬁed. Techniques such as natural-abundance
13C-NMR and
high-pressure liquid chromatography are now routinely used toprobe the intracellular environment of the moderate halo-philes. These techniques led to the identiﬁcation of the tetra-hydropyrimidines ectoine and hydroxyectoine (Fig. 1), and tothe recognition of the role of glycine betaine, which is notsynthesized by most representatives of the group but can bereadily taken up if available in the outside medium. Before theimportance of these compounds was realized, unsuccessful at-tempts to identify intracellular organic compounds at highconcentrations led to the view that these bacteria may be ableto manage without the traditional osmotic balance and maymaintain a hypoosmotic cytoplasm (351). The discovery thatectoine and hydroxyectoine, two compounds that have longresisted detection, may be present inside the cells in molarVOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 521concentrations abolished the need to hypothesize a hypoos-
motic intracellular space (363). The observation that cells ofS. costicola swelled rapidly upon treatment with penicillin
(254) is also incompatible with the concept of a hypoosmoticcytoplasm, since it will not support the turgor pressure neces-sary for cell growth.
The organic intracellular solutes are called compatible sol-
utes, since they provide osmotic balance without interferingwith the metabolic functions of the cells (17, 132). We do notintend present here an in-depth discussion of the action oforganic solutes, including the question why some are more“compatible” than others in enabling activity of salt-sensitiveenzymes at low water activities. For a survey of the theoriesproposed, we refer the reader to the reviews by Galinski (80–82). Compatible solutes are polar, highly soluble moleculesand uncharged or zwitterionic as physiological pH. They arestrong water structure formers and as such are probably ex-cluded from the hydration shell of proteins. This “preferentialexclusion” probably explains their function as effective stabi-lizers of the hydration shell of proteins. Water near the inter-faces is structurally different (more dense), allowing the os-motic solutes to migrate toward the less dense water fraction.This phenomenon of nonspeciﬁc exclusion is often described interms of increased surface tension of water, with the presenceof solutes affecting the forces of cohesion between water, min-imization of entropy, and reinforcement of the hydrophobiceffect. Compatible solutes display a general stabilizing effect bypreventing the unfolding and denaturation of proteins causedby heating, freezing, and drying (79–82, 85).
(i) Amino acids. Most early attempts to detect organic os-
motic solutes in moderately halophilic bacteria were aimed atthe quantitation of intracellular amino acids. The search foramino acids was to some extent inspired by the ﬁnding that invitro protein synthesis by ribosomes of S. costicola is already
inhibited by relatively low chloride concentrations but pro-ceeds uninhibited or even somewhat stimulated in the pres-ence of 0.6 M potassium glutamate (141, 173). Also, a numberof tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes are strongly inhibited byCl
2but function well i n 1 M sodium or potassium glutamate or
higher.
With the exception of a few specialized groups of gram-
positive bacteria that accumulate proline (see below), aminoacids do not seem to be of great quantitative importance asosmotic solutes in moderate halophiles. In H. elongata , the
total intracellular amino acid pool increased with medium sa-linity (16, 105, and 358 mM in cells grown in 0.05, 1.37, and 3.4M NaCl, respectively). In the 358 mM amino acid pool, Gluwas found at the highest concentration, followed by Ala andGln (359). In H. halophila , intracellular Gly and Asp concen-
trations increased with salinity (44). However, the data pre-sented (in micrograms of amino acid per milligram of protein)do not allow an exact calculation of cytoplasmic concentra-tions. Quite high glutamate concentrations were detected inS. costicola (428, 1,203 and 389 mM in cells grown in 0.51, 1.7,
and 3.4 M NaCl, respectively) (170).
Proline is the main organic osmotic solute in certain gram-
positive species ( Salinicoccus roseus and Salinicoccus hispani-
cus) (87, 306). In other gram-positive halophiles, amino acids
do not contribute greatly to the osmotic balance. Thus, Bacillus
haloalcaliphilus maintains an intracellular amino acid concen-
tration of about 70 mmol/kg of water (361). The halotolerantPlanococcus strain A4a, isolated from the dry valleys of Ant-
arctica, showed an increase in the concentrations of intracel-lular amino acids with salinity: cells grown in 0 and 1.5 M NaClcontained intracellular Glu, Asp, and Gln concentrations of102, 6, and 8 mM and 71, 49, and 39 mM, respectively. In 1.5M salt-grown cells, the total intracellular amino acid concen-tration was about 340 mM, in addition to 605 to 640 mM K

(207).
(ii) Glycine betaine. Glycine betaine was recognized in the
early 1980s as the most important organic osmotic solute inphotosynthetic purple bacteria and halophilic cyanobacteria.Its possible role in the osmotic stabilization of halophilic het-erotrophic bacteria had been suggested as early as 1968 (273).When grown in complex growth media, most halophilic bacte-ria accumulate glycine betaine or its precursor, choline, from

is still hypothetical. Modiﬁed from reference 85 with permission of the publisher.522 VENTOSA ET AL. MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.the medium, and under these conditions glycine betaine is
often found as the sole or main osmotic solute (131). However,with the possible exception of the actinomycete Actinopoly-
spora halophila , none of the halophilic or halotolerant hetero-
trophic bacteria seem to be able to synthesize the compoundde novo (80).
Certain halophilic bacteria can use glycine betaine not only
as an osmotic stabilizer but also as a carbon and energy source.A number of haloalkaliphilic isolates from Mono Lake, Calif.,grew on glycine betaine by sequential demethylation via di-methylglycine to sarcosine, which was then excreted into themedium. At high salinities, glycine betaine catabolism was sup-pressed and the compound was taken up solely to serve as anosmotic solute, thereby allowing extension of the salt range,enabling growth in 2.5 to 3–3.5 M NaCl (51). An unidentiﬁedHalomonas sp. grew on glycine betaine as the sole carbon and
energy source by oxidation via dimethylglycine and sarcosineto glycine. Growth on glycine betaine was possible only up to2 M NaCl. For growth at higher salt concentrations, the pres-ence of another carbon and energy source such as glucose wasrequired, and catabolism of glycine betaine was inhibited, sothat it served as an osmotic solute only (36).
(iii) Ectoine and hydroxyectoine. Ectoine, ﬁrst detected as
an osmotic solute in photosynthetic purple bacteria of the ge-nusEctothiorhodospira , is derived from N-acetylated diamino-
butyrate by intramolecular dehydration to form a pyrimidinederivative. As a result of the delocalization of the pelectrons,
the amino functions are not reactive, and therefore the com-pound has escaped detection for a long time (82). Ectoine anditsb-hydroxy derivative are now recognized as the most wide-
spread compatible solutes found in the domain Bacteria (see
Table 6).
The biosynthesis of ectoine proceeds in three enzymatic
steps, starting with aspartate semialdehyde, with diaminobu-tyrate and N-g-acetyldiaminobutyrate as intermediates (259)
(Fig. 1). All three enzymes, diaminobutyrate transaminase, di-aminobutyrate acetyltransferase, and N-acetyldiaminobutyrate
dehydratase (“ectoine synthetase”), have been identiﬁed inH. elongata (81, 259). Hydroxyectoine was hypothesized to be
synthesized in a similar pathway, but the intermediates andenzymes involved are unknown (180). Some of the enzymesinvolved in ectoine synthesis in H. elongata have been isolated
and partially characterized. The 2,4-diaminobutyrate transam-inase has an apparent molecular mass of 260 kDa and probablyconsists of six subunits. The presence of K
1ions (1 to 50 mM)
increased the activity threefold and also stabilized the enzyme(323). An alternative biosynthesis pathway for ectoine, startingwith glutamate, was suggested to be operative in Brevibacte-
rium linens (15) and in Streptomyces parvulus (134).
Ectoine was found in high concentrations in different Halo-
monas species and is the dominant solute in cells grown in
deﬁned medium lacking glycine betaine or its precursor, cho-line (24, 363). Intracellular ectoine concentrations can be suf-ﬁciently high to balance the osmotic pressure of the medium incombination with the intracellular ions and other dissolvedorganic compounds present. H. elongata grown in 10% NaCl
had an estimated ectoine concentration of 2.25 M, which, inaddition to about 0.4 M cations and negative counterions,would give about 3.05 M, a value close to osmotic equilibrium(363). The ectoine concentration in H. israelensis is probably
much lower: 0.1 to 0.2 M ectoine was measured in cells grownin 1 to 2 M salt (277). Also, S. costicola produces ectoine, but
its intracellular concentrations never approach those of theNaCl in the medium. It was estimated that the “true” intracel-lular environment of H. israelensis andS. costicola may osmot-ically balance 60 to 80% of the extracellular solute concentra-
tion (160).
(iv) Other organic osmotic solutes. Amino acids, glycine
betaine, and the tetrahydropyrimidines are by no means theonly organic compounds found in moderately halophilic bac-teria. The following are also found. (i) Nε-acetyllysine and Nd-
acetylornithine were identiﬁed by
13C-NMR in a number of
gram-positive bacteria such as Halobacillus halophilus and
Planococcus spp. The second compound is also known as an in-
termediate in arginine biosynthesis. Intracellular concentra-tions may be in the molar range (up to 0.5 mmol/mg [dry
weight]). In a strain designated M96/12b, proline is the domi-nant osmotic solute in the exponential growth phase and isreplaced by Nd-acetylornithine in stationary-phase cells (364).
(ii) Polyamines cannot be expected to play a signiﬁcant role inosmoregulation, since they were never found in high concen-trations. Certain moderately halophilic bacteria may lack poly-amines altogether: no polyamines were detected in S. costicola
(109, 139). Halomonas and Chromohalobacter contain spermi-
dine (0.3 to 2.1 mmol/g of wet cells, which is in the concentra-
tion range generally found in nonhalophilic bacteria) (109).When grown in a complex medium, S. costicola can incorpo-
rate polyamines (putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, and sper-mine) from the medium. The presence of these polyamines didnot increase the osmotic stability of the cells upon salt down-shock (139).
(v) Distribution of organic osmotic solutes within moderate-
ly halophilic bacteria. An overview of the occurrence of or-
ganic osmotic solutes in different moderately halophilic bacte-ria is given in Table 6. A few general principles emerge fromthis table and from additional studies (80, 82, 87, 306, 330).(i) Cells grown in 10% salts generally have an organic solutecontent between 0.6 and 1.3 mmol/mg dry weight, equivalent to
about 10 to 20% of the cellular dry weight. (ii) Apart fromglycine betaine, all N-containing osmotic solutes are derivedfrom the glutamate or the aspartate branch of amino acidbiosynthesis. (iii) Uptake of osmotic solutes from the mediumis preferred over de novo synthesis. (iv) All bacteria tested takeup glycine betaine, but only Actinopolyspora halophila synthe-
sizes the compound de novo. (v) Ectoine and hydroxyectoineare the predominant osmotic solutes in representatives of thegamma subclass of the Proteobacteria and in many gram-posi-
tive species. (vi) Charged amino acids such as glutamate neveraccumulate at concentrations exceeding 0.4 M. (vii) Proline,Nd-acetylornithine, and Nε-acetyllysine are found in low-G 1C
gram-positive bacteria such as some Bacillus species and the
related genera Salinicoccus andHalobacillus . The interchange-
ability between proline and Nd-acetylornithine probably points
to a common biosynthetic pathway. (viii) In most cases, cells donot accumulate a single osmotic solute but maintain intracel-lular cocktails of different compounds. Glutamate is oftenfound as a minor compound in organisms that contain primar-ily ectoines (36, 165). The types of osmotic solutes present inthe cells may depend greatly on the growth conditions. Thus,H. israelensis contained mainly trehalose when grown below 0.6
M salt, but at higher salt concentrations ectoine became themajor solute (277).
(vi) Uptake and action of exogeneously supplied glycine be-
taine. When grown in complex media, all heterotrophic, aero-
bic, moderately halophilic bacteria tested were found to con-tain glycine betaine at concentrations increasing from around0.2 M to 0.65–0.85 M to ove r1Mi n cells grown in 3, 10, and
20% salts, respectively (131, 133). Glycine betaine is eithertaken up from the medium (171) or derived from choline bymeans of an O
2-dependent choline oxidase (producing betaine
aldehyde), and an NAD-dependent betaine aldehyde dehydro-VOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 523genase. H. elongata andS. costicola possess both enzymes, and
hybridization experiments with speciﬁc gene probes have de-
tected genes similar to the betA and betB genes of E. coli
(22). The choline oxidase of S. costicola is membrane bound,
and its activity was strongly induced by the presence of cholineand inhibited by Cl
2ions. The betaine aldehyde dehydroge-
nase is located in the cytoplasm. Its activity was stimulated by0.5 M NaCl, and the enzyme could function at up t o 2 M salt.
The intracellular glycine betaine concentration increased withexternal salt and with the availability of choline (29, 171). Ahigh-afﬁnity transport system for glycine betaine and the en-zymes of the choline-betaine pathway were characterized inH. elongata (23). Thin-layer chromatography and
13C-NMR
analysis showed that exogeneous choline is taken up and trans-formed in H. elongata , demonstrating the existence of the cho-
line-glycine betaine pathway (23).
The ﬁrst indication of the importance of glycine betaine in
the physiology of moderately halophilic bacteria came from astudy of respiration in H. israelensis . Glycine betaine was found
to improve the salt resistance of the respiration system andto accelerate succinate oxidation. Stimulation was more pro-nounced the higher the NaCl concentration of the medium(273, 309). Labeled glycine betaine was accumulated by thecells. The authors stated that, “Apparently the prerequisite forthe betaine effect is that the cells be free of, or contain little of,a genuine factor associated with salt resistance, and betaineacts by replacing it. Therefore the high-salt-grown cells, notinﬂuenced by betaine, presumably contained the genuine fac-tor, which they may have acquired either through accumula-tion from their environment or by a process of synthesis andretention,” and, “Since it was shown that betaine accumulationwas also salt-dependent, it seems that salt resistance was di-rectly related to intracellular betaine concentration.” (273).The real nature of the stimulatory effect of glycine betaine isnot yet completely clear, and it was suggested to be due neitherto stimulation of substrate uptake nor to counteracting of plas-molysis; instead, it seemed to involve an effect on the cytoplas-mic membrane, distinct from its function as a compatible sol-ute (296). Ken-Dror et al. (155) suggested that the effect ofglycine betaine on respiration may be explained by isoosmoticadaptation due to its accumulation in the cytosol (deplasmoly-
sis) or by facilitation of penetration of Na
1into plasmolyzed
cells. Na1was found to be required for the proper functioning
of the respiratory chain, and no glycine betaine accumulationwas observed in the absence of Na
1.
(vii) Accumulation of other osmotic solutes by transport
from the medium. Glycine betaine is not the only compound
that can be taken up from the medium and serve as an osmoticsolute. Other more unusual compounds can be accumulatedfor the same purpose. Two haloalkaliphilic isolates from MonoLake designated strains ML-D and ML-G, produce ectoine inminimal medium. Strain ML-D also synthesizes hydroxyecto-ine. Under nitrogen limitation, exogenously supplied dimeth-ylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) (normally produced by marinealgae as an osmotic solute) substituted for ectoine in strainML-G and became the major intracellular solute. Strain ML-Dcould accumulate arsenobetaine (produced by the brine shrimp inMono Lake) for the same purpose (32). Not only can DMSPserve as an osmotic solute in heterotrophic bacteria, but also itmay be catabolized. Two moderately halophilic alkaliphilesisolated from Mono Lake could grow on DMSP, one strain bycleaving it to DMS and acrylate, the other by demethylationwith 3-methiolpropionate as an intermediate, yielding meth-anethiol. At high salinities, DMSP catabolism was suppressedand the compound was preferentially taken up and used forosmotic purposes (51).
ENZYMES
When discussing enzymatic activities of moderately halophil-
ic bacteria, and especially their relation to salt, we must dis-criminate three distinct categories of activities: (i) intracellularenzymes, which are not exposed to the salt concentration of themedium but sense the “true” intracellular environment—inmost cases characterized by low ion concentrations and thepresence of organic osmotic solutes; (ii) membrane-bound ac-tivities, including transport proteins, which sense both the in-tracellular environment and the outer medium; and (iii) trulyextracellular enzymes, exposed to the external hypersaline con-TABLE 6.

Cytoplasmic Enzymes
The pyruvate kinase of S. costicola has a high percentage of
the acidic amino acids Asp and Glu and a low proportion ofhydrophobic amino acids and is enriched in Gly and Ser, alltypical characteristics of halophilic proteins (47, 48). Stabilitywas improved at high salinities. However, while a low concen-tration (0.25 M) of NaCl or KCl was somewhat stimulatory,virtually no activity was detected abov e 1 M salt. This would
imply that if the intracellular Na
1and K1concentrations are
as high as reported (Table 5), the enzyme can be expected tobe strongly inhibited under physiological conditions (48), as-suming no sparing effect of compatible solutes.
The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase of S. costicola did
not show a great excess of acidic over basic amino acid resi-dues, and in this respect it resembled the enzyme from animalsand yeast. However, an unusually high content of Gly and Serwas found (16.7 and 10.2%), which supposedly maintains thebalance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces. Oxalo-acetate decarboxylation and
14CO2-oxaloacetate exchange were
activated by NaCl and KCl at concentrations up t o 1 M (with
the activities being about 2.5 times as high as in the absence ofsalt), while the optimum for carboxylation of phosphoenol-pyruvate was found at 0.025 to 0.05 M salt. In view of theseproperties, it was suggested that under physiological conditionsthe enzyme probably acts in the direction of phosphoenolpyru-vate synthesis (300, 302).
Other enzymes from Salinivibrio that have been character-
ized are the NADP-speciﬁc malic enzyme, glycerol dehydro-genase, threonine deaminase, and aspartate transcarbamylase.The malic enzyme was found to be unstable in dilute solutionsbut stable i n 1 M NaCl or KCl or in 25% glycerol. Maximum
activation occurred by 0.1 M NH
4Cl or KCl (not by NaCl), and
higher concentrations were inhibitory, with about 23% of theoptimal activity remaining at 0.85 M NaCl or KCl (301). Theglycerol dehydrogenase was most active at 0.25 to 0.5 M salt,and KCl was preferred over NaCl. The enzyme was very salttolerant, with about 60% of its maximal activity remaining in 3M KCl. In this respect, it is not greatly different from a similarenzyme from E. coli (9). The threonine deaminase was most
active in the absence of salt, with as little as 30% of the optimalactivity remaining i n 3 M NaCl or KCl. However, salts did
stabilize the enzyme. Regulatory properties were not greatlyinﬂuenced: feedback inhibition by isoleucine was observedboth in the absence of salt and i n 3 M NaCl or KCl, so this
enzyme is expected to function well over a wide range ofsalinities (168, 169). The aspartate transcarbamylase showedmuch more pronounced halophilic properties: it proved stableat 1.5 M NaCl, but activity was rapidly lost at lower salt con-centrations. Optimal activity was measured at 1.5 M NaCl or1.0 M KCl, but high activity was still present at 0.15 M NaCl.The enzyme differs from its nonhalophilic ( Saccharomyces )
and halophilic archaeal ( Halobacterium salinarum [formerly
H. cutirubrum ]) counterparts in the salt response patterns of
activity and regulation: ATP and CTP were inhibitory, with thestrongest inhibition in the low-salt range. Above 0.5 M salt,hardly any regulatory effect of CTP was observed. This obser-vation is important since enzymes must not only be active butalso be subject to allosteric regulation (5).
The properties of the alanine dehydrogenase of H. elongata
depend greatly on the salt concentration at which the cellswere grown. The enzyme isolated from cells grown at 50 mMsalt was optimally active at salt concentrations between 0 and
20 mM, while the enzyme isolated from 1.37 M and 3.4 Msalt-grown cells had its optimum at 340 and 500 to 600 mM,respectively (19). The estimated intracellular salt concentra-tions of the cells grown at the respective salinities were 42, 312,and 630 mM; hence, the enzyme seems to be well adapted tothe actual conditions inside the cells. No simple explanationwas put forward for the phenomenon, but for cells grown at0.05 and 1.37 M salt, two bands with alanine dehydrogenaseactivity were detected on native gels, while for cells grown in3.4 M, only one band was seen (19). Experiments involvingdissociation during different enzyme puriﬁcation methods andsequence analyses would clarify the effect. Low salt concentra-tions were optimal for the functioning of isocitrate, malate,succinate and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases from H. halo-
denitriﬁcans , while lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxi-
dase (being membrane-bound enzymes) were more active inthe presence of salt (10). Also in the alkaliphilic Bacillus halo-
alkaliphilus , the intracellular malate dehydrogenase and isoci-
trate dehydrogenase were inhibited by salt, with about 20% ofthe optimal activity remaining above 1 t o 2 M NaCl (361).
Organophosphorus acid anhydrase activity was detected in ahalophilic isolate (designated JD6.5, probably belonging to thegenus Alteromonas ) isolated from a warm, hypersaline (24%
salt) spring near the Great Salt Lake, Utah (38). No informa-tion was given about the salt requirement or the sensitivity ofthe enzyme.
The complex enzymatic machinery required for protein syn-
thesis by the ribosomes presents an excellent object for thestudy of the inﬂuence of salt on intracellular activities, andtherefore extensive research efforts have been dedicated to invitro protein synthesis by S. costicola ribosomes (30, 141, 171,
173, 368). These studies included the measurement of poly(U)-directed phenylalanine incorporation and [
14C]valine incorpo-
ration, with E. coli phage R17RNA as the template, leading to
the formation of a protein with the same electrophoretic mo-bility as the valine-rich R
17coat protein. Optimum activity was
obtained at low salt concentrations (0.1 to 0.3 M, with am-monium glutamate being the most stimulatory). Choride saltsproved especially inhibitory (with NH
4Cl, KCl, and NaCl being
increasingly toxic), and hardly any activity was observed inthe presence of 0.6 M Cl
2. Choride was found to prevent the
attachment of the 50S ribosomal subunit to the 30S subunit-mRNA complex and also displaced already bound ribosomes.The accuracy of the translation process was not affected. How-ever, the inhibitory effect of Cl
2could be partially reversed by
glycine betaine or glutamate. When Cl2was replaced by other
anions, such as glutamate, sulfate, or acetate, excellent in vitroprotein synthesis activity was found at cation concentrationsas high as 0.6 M, both in S. costicola and in H. canadensis (30,
141, 171, 173, 368). Not all components of the protein-synthe-sizing machinery are equally chloride sensitive: the phenyl-alanyl-tRNA synthetase of S. costicola functions well at 0.5 M
NaCl. The ribosomal proteins of S. costicola are slightly more
acidic than those of E. coli but much less so than those of the
halobacteria. The S. costicola ribosomes showed an unusual sed-
imentation behavior in sucrose gradients: association of sub-units to monosomes took place only at high salt concentrations(367). A study of the binding of dihydrostreptomycin to the 30Sribosomal subunits of S. costicola showed more binding in cells
grown at high salt concentrations, suggesting that some ribo-somal properties may vary with the salt concentration in whichthe cells were grown (161).VOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 525Stress Proteins
Upon sudden exposure to high NaCl concentrations (2 to 2.5
M), low-salt-grown H. halophila cells showed a transient ces-
sation of cell division. During the initial phase of the adapta-tion to the new conditions, protein synthesis and amino aciduptake were inhibited. During the adaptation period, changesin the patterns of pulse-labelled proteins were observed. Dis-tinct changes were also seen in the protein proﬁles upon down-shock from 2.5 t o 1 M salt, but only minor changes were found
upon downshock from 1 to 0.5 M (59). High-salt-related pro-teins of 39, 24, 20, and 15.5 kDa have been identiﬁed inH. elongata , and the synthesis of these proteins increased with
increasing salinity. A different set of proteins (60, 42, 15, and 6kDa) was induced under low-salt conditions (209).
A study of protein turnover in S. costicola by monitoring the
breakdown of pulse-labeled proteins showed that in cells grow-ing exponentially in 1 or 1.5 M NaCl the turnover is about 5%per h and in cells growing in 0.5 M NaCl the turnover is as highas 9% per h, compared with 1 to 2% per h for E. coli . A shift
from high-salt to low-salt conditions gave rise to an increase inthe turnover rate of pulse-labeled proteins. It was suggestedthat the low salt concentration alters the “native” protein con-formation and increases the susceptibility of proteins to pro-teolysis. Hipkiss et al. postulated that the increased proteinturnover at low salinity may set a limit to growth at such con-centrations (119).
The appearance of heat shock proteins was examined in
Chromobacterium marismortui . When cells were grown in 1 M
salt, transfer to 42°C resulted in complete inhibition of thesynthesis of the normal proteins and induced the formation ofheat shock proteins. In cells grown in 2.5 M salt, a heat shockat 42°C still allowed the synthesis of some of the normal pro-teins. The higher the salt concentration at which the cells weregrown, the higher the upper temperature limit at which heatshock proteins could be synthesized (150). A similar phenom-enon was observed in H. halophila (149).
Also, the sensitivity of H. halophila to oxidative stress (sen-
sitivity to H
2O2) depends on the NaCl concentration of the
medium. Cells grown i n 1 M salt were much more resistant to
peroxide than were 2.5 M salt-grown cells. The effect could notbe explained by differences in catalase activity. Exposure to 50mMH
2O2resulted in the induction of several new proteins.
The number of these proteins and the kinetics and extent oftheir induction were inﬂuenced by salinity, with the adaptiveresponse to nonlethal concentrations of H
2O2being faster in
1 M than in 2.5 M NaCl (220).
A manganese superoxide dismutase of H. israelensis was also
characterized. This enzyme did not require salt for activity(373).
Membrane-Bound Enzymes
Membrane-bound enzymes are in contact with the high salt
concentrations in the medium, and therefore they can be ex-pected to be active at high salt concentrations or even torequire high salt concentrations for full activity.
A membrane-bound 5 9-nucleotidase of S. costicola was op-
timally active a t 2 M NaCl or KCl or higher. This enzyme splits
ATP, ADP, and AMP, which are dephosphorylated to adeno-sine, which is subsequently transported into the cells. Its activ-ity is distinct from that of the F
0F1ATPase also present in the
membrane and can be differentiated from that of the protonchannel ATPase by its higher magnesium requirement and itsinsensitivity to DCCD (11, 12). Also the DCCD-inhibited F
0F1
ATPase of S. costicola requires high salt concentrations for
both activity and stability, with optimal activity reported at 0.5M KCl. KCl concentrations of up t o 3 M caused relatively little
inhibition, bu t 3 M NaCl produced 75% inhibition (26, 117).
The NADH:quinone oxidoreductase of H. israelensis de-
pends on Na1for activity. Na1ions increased the rate of
quinone reduction severalfold, but oxidation of the quinol withoxygen was not affected by Na
1(153). Succinate respiration in
this organism was Na1dependent and showed a maximum rate
between 0.2 and 0.8 M Na1(272).
The membrane-bound nitrate reductase and nitrite reduc-
tase activities of H. halodenitriﬁcans were separated by treat-
ment with detergent and ammonium sulfate fractionation. Thenitrite reductase was identiﬁed as a cd-type cytochrome (99,100). Both a membrane-bound and a cytoplasmic nitrite re-ductase activity were detected. When phenazine methosulfateand ascorbate served as electron donors, the membrane-boundenzyme produced nitrous oxide and the cytoplasmic enzymeproduced nitric oxide. In the presence of methyl viologen anddithionite, the cytoplasmic enzyme produced ammonia. Aftersolubilization, the membrane-bound enzyme behaved like thecytoplasmic one and produced nitric oxide or ammonia in thepresence of the above-mentioned electron donors. All ac-tivities are probably due to one cd-type cytochrome enzyme,
whose products depend on its location and on the nature of theelectron donors (186). Manometric activity measurements inresting-cell suspensions showed nitrite reduction to be op-timally active at 0.38 to 0.75 M NaCl, with about 20% of themaximum activity remaining in the presence o f 3 M NaCl
(283). A membrane-bound assimilatory nitrate reductase wascharacterized in H. israelensis . This enzyme accepts electrons
from the electron transport chain in a pathway that includes ab-type cytochrome and was found to be very similar to dissim-
ilatory membrane-bound nitrate reductases known from otherorganisms. The assimilatory nitrite reductase was soluble, re-pressed by ammonium ions, and induced by nitrate, and it usedreduced ferredoxin as its preferred electron donor (125).
Other membrane-associated enzymes activated by salt are
the lactate dehydrogenase of H. halodenitriﬁcans (optimum
concentration, 0.8 M NaCl) (10, 283) and the alkaline phos-phatase of “ P. halosaccharolytica ” (370). Alkaline and acid
phosphatases were detected in H. elongata , with both enzymes
being located on the cell envelope. In low-salt (50 mM)-growncells, little activity was detected, and at higher salinities (1.4and 3.4 M), the activities of both enzymes were optimal at thesame salt concentration at which the cells were grown. Theseenzymes thus seem to “adapt” to the NaCl concentration in themedium in a mechanism that was not further elucidated. Theeffect was not due to the presence of isozymes, since only oneband of each enzyme was detected on gels (18).
Extracellular Enzymes
A considerable amount of effort has been dedicated to the
study of extracellular salt-tolerant enzymes of the moderatelyhalophilic bacteria, especially toward the use of such enzymesin biotechnological processes.
Halophilic amylases were characterized from a moderately
halophilic Acinetobacter (236), N. halobia (240), “ M. varians
subsp. halophilus ” (158), and other Micrococcus isolates (157,
233, 234). A moderately halophilic Acinetobacter strain isolated
from sea sand had two amylases. Both were most active at pH7 and 50 to 55°C in 0.2 to 0.6 M NaCl or KCl. Activity was lostupon dialysis against water but could be stabilized by the ad-dition of 10 mM CaCl
2. Cells grown in 1 t o 2 M NaCl made the
largest amount of enzyme, and only a small amount of amylasewas produced during growth in low-salt medium or at 4 MNaCl (236). An amylase was puriﬁed from N. halobia .I tw a s526 VENTOSA ET AL. MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.optimally active at pH 6 to 7 in 0.25 M NaCl or 0.75 M KCl and
at 50 to 55°C. The products of starch degradation were mal-tose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, and small amounts of glu-cose (240). “ M. varians subsp. halophilus ” produced the highest
amylase activity when grown i n 2 M NaCl. When the organism
was grown at lower salt concentrations, the excreted enzymewas inactivated by the low salt concentration but could be re-activated by dialysis against 2.5 M NaCl. The enzyme was sta-bilized by 10 mM CaCl
2. The puriﬁed amylase has two com-
ponents with apparent molecular masses of 86 and 60 kDa.Both were optimally active at 0.75 t o 1 M NaCl or KCl and pH
6 to 7 at 55°C (in the absence of CaCl
2) or 60°C (in the
presence of 50 mM CaCl2) (158). The amylases from two other
micrococci showed maximum activity i n 1 M NaCl at pH 7.5
and 50°C (157) and in 1.4 t o 2 M NaCl at pH 6 to 7 and 50°C
(233, 234).
Little information has been published on extracellular pro-
teases from moderately halophilic bacteria. An unidentiﬁedpseudomonad was reported to secrete a protease with a maxi-mum activity at 18% salt (337).
“M. varians subsp. halophilus ” produces a nuclease (nuclease
H) when grown in 1 t o 4 M NaCl or KCl. The puriﬁed enzyme
has both DNase and RNase activities. Enzyme production ismaximal in media containing 2.5 to 3.5 M salt. The enzyme wasalso synthesized in media containing RbCl, CsCl, or Na
2SO4
but not in media containing LiCl, NaNO3, NaBr, or NaI (147).
Activity was optimal when the organism was grown in 2.9 MNaCl or 2.1 M KCl at 40°C. Activity was lost by dialysis againstwater but was restored upon dialysis against buffer containing3.4 M NaCl (142, 143). The protein had a large (21 mol%)excess of acidic over basic amino acids (145). Inclusion of highmagnesium (40 mM or higher) or phosphate (over 14 mM)concentrations in the medium abolished extracellular nucleaseactivity and caused ﬂocculation of the cells. Under these con-ditions, the enzyme was adsorbed to the surface of the ﬂocs(144, 372). The nuclease shows considerable biotechnologicalpotential (see below).
Another halophilic nuclease (an exonuclease, releasing 5 9-
mononucleotides from both DNA and RNA) was produced byBacillus halophilus . The enzyme was optimally active in 1.4 to
3.2 M NaCl or 2.3 to 3.2 M KCl and was stimulated by Mg
21
and Ca21ions. Activity was lost by dialysis against water, but
10 mM Ca21stabilized the protein and dialysis against 3.5 M
NaCl restored most of the activity. The optimum pH was 8.5,and the optimum temperature was 50 or 60°C when DNA andRNA served as the substrate, respectively (239).
Amino Acid Composition of Proteins from
Moderately Halophilic Bacteria
Halophilic archaea of the family Halobacteriaceae contain
high intracellular salt concentrations, and their proteins areadapted to the presence of molar concentrations of K
1,N a1,
and Cl2. This adaptation is reﬂected in the bulk amino acid
composition of these microorganisms, showing a high contentof acidic amino acids (Glu and Asp), and a low content of basicamino acids. A low proportion of hydrophobic amino acids isoffset by a high frequency of amino acids such as Gly and Ser(177).
The aerobic halophilic bacteria tolerate high salt concentra-
tions, but organic osmotic solutes provide most of the osmoticbalance. However, the apparent intracellular salt concentra-tions can be fairly high (Table 5). Therefore, one should expectthat extracellular and membrane-bound proteins of the halo-philic bacteria may display halophilic characteristics with ami-no acid compositions similar to those found in the halophilicarchaea, while there is little a priori reason to assume that the
cytoplasmic proteins should show such adaptations. However,in view of reports of high apparent intracellular salt concen-trations in certain species (Table 5), some degree of halophiliccharacter may be expected in the intracellular enzymes as well.
Comparative studies showed that ribosomal proteins from
moderate halophiles often had a slightly higher content of acidicamino acids than did the comparable proteins from E. coli and
other nonhalophiles. Thus, the N-terminal sequences of theribosomal A proteins of S. costicola and H. canadensis were
slightly more acidic than that of the E. coli protein but much
less so than that of the similar protein from H. salinarum
(cutirubrum ), with the ratios of basic to acidic amino acids
being 0.36 in S. costicola and 0.41 in H. canadensis , compared
to 0.54 in E. coli and 0.05 in H. salinarum (62, 63). The values
for whole ribosomes of H. canadensis were 1.23 and 1.16,
respectively, compared to 1.58 in E. coli and 0.69 in H. salina-
rum (61). The average hydrophobicity of the ribosomal pro-
teins of S. costicola and H. canadensis did not differ greatly
from that for E. coli and was much higher than that for H. halo-
bium (194).
Determinations of the abundance of different amino acids in
the bulk protein of H. elongata showed an excess of acidic
amino acids and a low frequency of basic amino acids, withthe values being intermediate between those for E. coli and
the archaeon Haloferax mediterranei . Convergent evolution of
amino acid usage was suggested to have led to this “halophilic”character of the H. elongata proteins (93). However, this con-
vergent evolution did not lead to changes in the frequencies ofthe hydrophobic amino acids. The ratio of the occurrence ofhydrophobic amino acids (Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, and Met) tothat of the borderline hydrophobic amino acids (Ser and Thr)was 3.56 in H. elongata , compared with 3.58 in E. coli , 2.73 in
H. mediterranei , and 2.46 in membranes of H. salinarum (248).
CELL ENVELOPES
The cytoplasmic membrane forms the barrier between the
cytoplasm (generally low in salt) and the environment with itshigh and possibly ﬂuctuating salinity. It can thus be expectedthat the properties of this membrane are regulated by theoutside salt concentration to adjust such functions as ion per-meability and the activity of integral membrane proteins (294).The envelope of the moderate halophiles is involved in regu-lating the cytoplasmic ionic environment by both binding andpumping ions, and haloadaptation is at least in part a responseof the cell envelope to osmotic stress (296).
Salt-dependent changes in the properties of the cell mem-
brane have been identiﬁed on the levels both of the types ofphospholipids that dominate in the membrane structure and ofthe types of fatty acid chains present in the lipids.
Polar Lipids
Studies of the effect of salinity on polar lipid composition of
the membranes have consistently shown that the higher thesalinity, the higher the content of negatively charged phospho-lipids at the expense of neutral phospholipids. With increasedsalt concentrations, the amount of phosphatidylethanolamine(PE) (uncharged) is decreased and there is a concomitantincrease in the amounts of the negatively charged phosphati-dylglycerol (PG) and/or diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin,CL) (294, 351, 354).
To explain the shift toward a higher negative-charge density
on the membrane at increasing salt concentration, it was ﬁrstpostulated that the increase in the amount of anionic lipidsVOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 527served to allow charge balance at the membrane surface ex-
posed to high Na1concentrations (121, 122). However, a sim-
ple calculation showed that millimolar concentrations of saltwould sufﬁce to provide the negative-charge shielding (296).Moreover, a similar increase in the amount of negativelycharged polar lipids was observed when nonionic solutes wereadded to the medium to increase its osmotic value. Anotheridea proposed is that the high content of negative phospholip-ids may contribute to the regulation of the selective perme-ability of the membrane to cations (231). It is now assumedthat the change in polar lipid composition provides a mecha-nism for preserving the membrane bilayer structure. PE con-taining unsaturated fatty acids tends to form nonbilayerphases, while PG forms bilayers. Addition of PG to PE in theappropriate amounts could suppress the formation of a hex-agonal-II phase and thus counteract the effect of increasedsalinity. A functional membrane requires a suitable proportionof bilayer-forming and non-bilayer-forming lipids. Modiﬁca-tion of the membrane phospholipid ratio is necessary to pre-serve the integrity of the membrane bilayer in the face of anincreased tendency of PE to form nonbilayer phases as a con-sequence of raised external salinity. The tendency to formnonbilayer phases could activate speciﬁc phospholipid-synthe-sizing enzymes located in the membrane, resulting in a rise inthe proportion of lipids such as PG that prefer the lamellarphase, to counteract the disruptive forces of the nonbilayer-phase-forming lipids (293, 294, 322).
(i)Salinivibrio costicola. The major lipids of S. costicola are
PG and PE, with lesser amounts of lyso-PE, CL, a glycolipid,and two other phospholipids, tentatively identiﬁed as lyso-CLand lyso-PG. When the medium salinity was increased over therange 0.5 to 3 M, the level of PG increased and that of PEdecreased. Thus, the PG/PE ratio increased from 0.5:1 to 1:1when the medium salinity was increased from 1 to 3 M. Thegrowth phase of the culture had little effect on the lipid com-position (110, 322). The altered salt dependence of S. costicola
at temperatures below the optimum may be due to a modiﬁ-cation in the membrane lipid phase behavior and stabilitybrought about by changes in lipid composition (3).
The effect of salinity on the phase behavior of total lipid ex-
tracts from S. costicola was compared with the phase behavior
of binary mixtures of PG and PE. Although many similaritieswere detected, certain differences were observed, suggestingthat the minor lipid components do play a part in determiningthe phase behavior of the membrane (322).
Salt-sensitive mutants of S. costicola have been isolated with
a phospholipid composition similar to the wild type whengrown i n 1 M NaCl but showing only a partial change in
phospholipid composition upon growth at elevated salt con-centrations. These data provide evidence that a correct phos-pholipid composition may be needed for haloadaptation (162).
High concentrations of the chaotropic anion SCN
2( 1Ma s
KSCN but not as NaSCN) caused lysis of S. costicola . The
protective effect of Na1is probably due to speciﬁc interactions
of Na1with components of the cell membrane, thereby render-
ing their structure resistant to the action of chaotropic anions,which act by breaking hydrophobic bonds (335).
(ii)Halomonas elongata. In cells grown at 3.4 M NaCl, the
CL content was four times as high as in cells grown at 0.05 MNaCl; the change was mainly at the expense of PE, while thePG content did not change greatly. Thus, the anionic lipids PGand CL contributed 57% of the polar lipids at high salt con-centrations and 45% at low salt concentrations (354).
The hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface character of H. elon-
gata changed with medium salinity, as shown in phase parti-
tioning studies. Mid-exponential-phase cells growing at 3.4 MNaCl were more hydrophilic than cells at 0.05 M NaCl, and
high-salt-grown cells were more hydrophilic than low-salt-grown cells in all stages of growth. Surface hydrophobicitytended to increase as the cells approached the stationaryphase. The hydrophobicity of the cell was not inﬂuenced bytrypsin treatment, in contrast to many other microorganisms inwhich trypsin treatment converts hydrophobic to hydrophiliccells. The increase in the proportion of charged phospholipidsat higher NaCl concentrations may in part explain the hydro-philicity. At the high salinity, the hydrophilic cell surface makesthe cell more attractive to water molecules in a water-poorenvironment and the hydrated cell surface may help the cellobtain cytoplasmic water and thereby prevent desiccation (114).Electron microscopic studies showed that an increasing me-dium salinity had a profound effect on the cell envelope ofH. elongata , with the cell wall becoming more compact inter-
nally and coherent at higher salinity (354). The cell wall pep-tidoglycan is unique in that it contains leucine, which contrib-utes to the overall hydrophobicity of the cell. To study thedifferences in cell wall composition, rabbits were immunizedwith live H. elongata cells grown at different NaCl concentra-
tions. Antiserum prepared against low-salt-grown cells react-ed with cells grown at all salt concentrations, but antiserumagainst high-salt-grown cells was speciﬁc for this type of cells.Two possible explanations for the ﬁnding were put forward:either the low-salt-grown cells possessed a unique antigen, orsome type of conformational change in the surface antigenscaused the rabbits to respond to a determinant that was notexposed in low-salt-grown cells (355).
(iii) Halomonas israelensis. The major lipid components of
H. israelensis are PG and PE, with a-glucosyl-PG (256) and an
acidic glucuronic acid-containing glycolipid (glucuronosyldi-glyceride). In stationary-phase cells, the CL level was increasedat the expense of PG (317). The biosynthesis of glucosyl-PGwas studied in a cell-free system and was found to proceedfrom UDP-glucose and PG. Mg
21and Ca21were required for
activation, and KCl and NaCl were inhibitory, even at the lowconcentration of 0.1 M (319). Labeled glucuronosyldiglyceridewas formed from UDP-[
14C]glucuronic acid and added diglyc-
erides in a cell-free preparation. KCl and NaCl were inhibitory,with 0.5 M causing more than 80% inhibition (318).
(iv) “ Pseudomonas halosaccharolytica.” The major phospho-
lipids of “ P. halosaccharolytica ” are PE, PG, CL, and an un-
identiﬁed phosphoglycolipid—a glucosyl derivative of PG con-taining phosphate, glycerol, fatty acids, and glucose in the ratio1:2:2:1. When grown in the lower-salinity range (0.5 to 1 MNaCl), PE was twice as abundant as PG, while at high salinity(3 M or more), the amounts of PE and PG were approximatelyequal (121, 122, 230, 231). At a combination of high temper-ature and high salt concentration, acidic phospholipids wereespecially abundant (73.6 mol%), due to an increase in CL andglucosyl-PG levels with a decrease in the PE level (112). Uponentering the stationary growth phase, the content of CL in-creased at the expense of PG. The cytoplasmic membranecontained a higher proportion of acidic polar lipids than didthe outer membrane (50 and 40% respectively, in cells grownin 2 M NaCl). When 1% glucose was added to the medium, thephosphoglycolipid content increased to 25% of the total lipid.Thus, the phospholipid pattern resembled that of other mod-erate halophiles discussed above, with the phosphoglycolipidbeing possibly identical to the a-glucosyl-PG identiﬁed in H. is-
raelensis (230). As in H. israelensis , UDP-glucose served as the
glucosyl donor for its biosynthesis (229). The glucuronosyldi-glyceride of H. israelensis was not detected in “ P. halosaccha-
rolytica ” (230).
The outer membrane proteins of “ P. halosaccharolytica ”528 VENTOSA ET AL. MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.show a 20 to 26 mol% excess of acidic amino acids over pos-
itively charged ones, a level similar to that found in the ex-tremely halophilic archaea. When the medium salinity wasincreased from 0.85 to 2 M, there was a decrease in the level ofa major 43-kDa outer membrane protein and an increase in thelevel of a 50-kDa protein. A shift from 2 t o 3 M salt resulted in
a decrease in the level of the 50-kDa protein and the appear-ance of a 41-kDa protein (120–122).
(v) Other gram-negative halophilic bacteria. The mem-
branes of the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic halophilicrod-shaped bacterium designated Vibrio strain HX, now re-
named Halomonas canadensis (128) contained PE and PG
(together constituting more than 90% of all lipids) with smallamounts of CL and traces of a glycolipid and other lipids. ThePE/PG ratio decreased from 1.6 to 1.0 when the medium NaClconcentration was raised from 1 t o 4 M (2).
(vi) Gram-positive moderate halophiles. In the gram-posi-
tive species, the increase in the anionic lipid fraction withsalinity is generally due to an increase in the amount of CLrather than of PG. The effect may be nonspeciﬁc, since anincrease in the amount of CL at the expense of PG is oftenassociated with slowly growing cells, and growth rates are oftenreduced at high salt concentrations (293, 294, 296). Glyco(phospho)lipids are comparatively rare in the gram-negativebacteria but are often found in gram-positive bacteria (295).PE was reported to be absent in Bacillus haloalkaliphilus (327).
Studies of lipid metabolism in Planococcus sp. strain A4a
showed an increase in the amounts of anionic phospholipidsand a decrease in the amount of PE in the presence of increas-ing salt concentrations (205). When the organisms were grownat high concentrations of monovalent cations, the CL/PG ratiowas increased, while this ratio remained unchanged when MgCl
2,
CaCl2, or MgSO4was used to increase the medium salinity
(206). Elevated temperatures and salinity had an antagonisticeffect on phospholipid composition: a rise in temperaturecaused an increase in the PE content and a decrease in the CLcontent (205, 293).
(vii) Adaptation of the polar lipid composition to changing
salinities. The effect of sudden shifts in salt concentration on
lipid metabolism have been investigated in depth in S. costicola
(1, 163, 295–297) and in “ P. halosaccharolytica ” (113, 121, 122,
231). Adaptation to the new increased salinity occurred inthree phases. Within a few minutes, shrinkage of the cells withplasmolysis was observed and growth and phospholipid syn-thesis were severely inhibited. Within a few hours, growthresumed, as did the biosynthesis of PG, while PE synthesisremained at a low level, resulting in a decrease in the PE/PGratio. The duration of this lag period depends on the extent ofthe salinity shift. Synthesis of new proteins is not requiredduring the ﬁrst two phases of the adaptation. Only when thecorrect membrane composition has been achieved can the or-ganism resume growth. During the third phase, growth andlipid biosynthesis were fully adapted to the new salt concen-tration. The alteration in membrane phospholipid compositionmay be a necessary physiological response for adaptation tosalinity changes (163). No phospholipid turnover is involved inthe changes in lipid composition, with all changes being due tochanges in the relative biosynthesis rates.
After a salt upshock from 1 to 3 M, the ﬁrst increase in the
concentration of PG relative to PE is observed within minutes(296). The changes are due to an up-to-30-fold decrease in PEsynthesis, which recovered only slowly afterward, while PGsynthesis showed only a 5-fold initial decrease and recoveredrapidly (297). These changes in biosynthesis rates were foundto be fully reversible when the external NaCl concentrationwas restored to the previous level (1).Pulse-labeling and pulse-chase experiments with labeled ac-
etate or phosphate showed that when a culture was shiftedfrom 1 to 3 M salt, PG was synthesized more rapidly than PEduring the lag phase, with both being lower than before the saltshift. Following a shift from 3 to 1 M, the incorporation of labelinto PE rose sharply within 5 min and then slowly declinedwhile the incorporation of acetate into PG decreased to about50% of the value for PE (297).
It was argued that part of the effects of salt upshock may be
due to inhibition of fatty acid synthetase by salt entering thecell, which would starve the phospholipid biosynthesis systemof a supply of fatty acyl chains. Since the phospholipid biosyn-thetic enzymes are located in the cytoplasmic membrane, thebiosynthetic enzymes may respond directly to alterations inmembrane ﬂuidity and/or phase when the external solute con-centration is suddenly changed (297). The salt upshock is prob-ably sensed via osmotic pressure effects, since nonionic solutessuch as sucrose can cause similar effects on growth and phos-pholipid synthesis. Glycerol, which is much more permeablethan sucrose, was less osmotically stressful and did not inhibitPG biosynthesis (1, 295, 297). Thus, osmotic pressure changes,rather than alterations in ion concentrations, are responsiblefor triggering the haloadaptive changes in this organism.
In “P. halosaccharolytica ,” pulse-label experiments with pre-
cursors such as serine, acetate, and glycerol showed similareffects of salt on phospholipid biosynthesis. The radioactivityincorporated in PE decreased with increasing NaCl concentra-tions, while incorporation in PG remained constant between0.5 and 3.5 M salt (113, 121, 122, 231; for a critical assessmentof these experiments, see reference 294).
Effect of Salt Concentration on Fatty Acid Composition
The adaptation to growth in different salt concentrations is
often reﬂected in changes in the fatty acids of the membranelipids. These changes are markedly different in gram-negativeand gram-positive moderate halophiles. Since the fatty acidcomposition of membranes is also inﬂuenced by temperature,complex interrelations between salinity and temperature canbe expected.
(i) Gram-negative halophilic bacteria. In gram-negative halo-
philic bacteria, the content of cyclopropane fatty acids and un-saturated fatty acids generally increases with salt concentra-tion, with a decrease in the abundance of branched-chain fattyacids. The effect has been reported for such organisms as“P. halosaccharolytica ” (231), H. halmophila (211), H. halo-
phila (210), and H. canadensis (2).S. costicola was never shown
to produce cyclopropane fatty acids. Cyclopropane fatty acidsare made by the addition of a methyl group (donated by S-
adenosylmethionine) across the double bond of a monounsat-urated fatty acid, which makes the central part of the acyl chainmore rigid.
An increase in unsaturated and cyclopropane fatty acid con-
tent is expected to cause an increase in membrane ﬂuidity.However, this interpretation should be taken with some cau-tion, because in some species the major change is from unsat-urated to cyclopropane fatty acids. Our understanding of thefunctions and properties of cyclopropane fatty acids in mem-branes is limited. The physical properties of cyclopropane fattyacids (e.g., 17:0 cyclo) are intermediate between the corre-sponding saturated fatty acid (17:0) and the unsaturated fattyacid from which it was derived (16:1). Thus, an increase in theabundance of cyclopropane fatty acids at the expense of un-saturated fatty acids would tend to decrease membrane ﬂuidity(293, 294).
A survey of the occurrence of fatty acids among members ofVOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 529theHalomonadaceae and the genus Flavobacterium showed the
major fatty acids to be 18:1 v7c, 16:1 v7c, and 16:0. Cyclopro-
pane fatty acids were found in minor amounts (313). Otherstudies (75, 210, 255) showed a high abundance of cyclopro-pane fatty acids in Halomonas spp. The differences may be due
to variations in oxygen tension, medium composition, and ageof the culture. Flavobacterium salegens and F. gondwanense
from Organic Lake, Antarctica, had a high abundance of 15:0iso, 15:0, 15:1 v10c iso, 15:1 v10c anteiso, and 16:0. The struc-
ture of the branched-chain C
15monounsaturated fatty acids is
unusual and may be used as a taxonomic marker for thesebacteria. This biomarker is to be exploited in ecological studiesof Antarctic lakes (313). Another study, including Salinivibrio ,
Halomonas ,Alteromonas ,Chromobacterium ,Flavobacterium ,
and Pseudomonas isolates, showed 16:0, 16:1, and 18:1 (the
predominant fatty acid in most species examined) to be presentin all the strains tested while cyclopropane fatty acids weredetected in 26 of 40 strains tested (212).
H. halophila showed an increasing content of cyclopropane
fatty acids with increasing salt concentrations (from 7 to 25%of the fatty acids when NaCl was increased from 0.5 to 3.4 Mat the optimum growth temperature of 32°C), with a concom-itant decrease in the content of monounsaturated fatty acids. Itwas suggested that the cyclopropane fatty acid synthetase isactivated or induced by high levels of salt (210). When the saltconcentration was raised from 5 to 15%, the content of 17:0cyclo increased from 0 to 8.5%, that of 19:0 cyclo increasedfrom 4.2 to 14.9%, and that of the saturated branched-chain15:0 decreased from 42.9 to 31.9% (211). H. canadensis con-
tained twice as high a concentration of cyclopropane fatty acidswhen grown a t4Ma sa t0 . 7M salt (2). When the medium
NaCl concentration was raised from 1 to 3 M, the endogenousactivity of cyclopropane fatty acid synthetase measured in ly-sates was doubled. NaCl was inhibitory to both fatty acid syn-thetase (82% inhibition b y 3 M NaCl) and cyclopropane fatty
acid synthetase (97% inhibition b y 1 M NaCl), but both activ-
ities were stimulated up to 100-fold by 2 t o 3 M glycine betaine
(165).
The metabolism of cyclopropane fatty acids was most thor-
oughly studied in “ P. halosaccharolytica ” (112, 121, 122, 129,
130, 167, 214, 230, 231). This species contains 16:0, 16:1, 18:0,18:1, and 17:0 cyclo and 19:0 cyclo as the major fatty acids(230). The content of cyclopropane fatty acids increased withsalinity. A corresponding decrease occurred in the content ofmonounsaturated species. It was suggested that cyclopropanefatty acid synthetase was induced by high levels of NaCl (120–122). The proportion of cyclopropane fatty acids also increasedwith temperature (231) and upon reaching the stationary phase(214).
The biosynthesis of cyclopropane fatty acids in “ P. halosac-
charolytica ” was studied in depth by using labeled S-adenosyl-
methionine as the precursor in cell extracts (214). The cyclo-propane fatty acid synthetase either is an integral membraneprotein or is associated with the membrane. The activity ofcyclopropane fatty acid synthetase was inhibited by NaCl orKCl but stimulated up to 12-fold by glycine betaine. Maximumactivity was reached a t 3 M NaCl, a phenomenon similar to
that reported for H. canadensis (165). Shift-up experiments
(from 0.7 to 2.1 M NaCl) showed that the enzyme activityresponded immediately to increased glycine betaine concen-trations and that enzyme induction is not required to achievethe salt-dependent alterations in cyclopropane fatty acid con-tent observed in vivo. Other compatible solutes tested (tre-halose and sucrose) were less effective than glycine betaine(ectoine was not tested because it was not available). It wassuggested that the compatible solute accumulating upon salt
upshock may directly stimulate or protect enzyme activity.
Electron paramagnetic resonance studies of rotational move-
ments of lipids in the membranes in intact “ P. halosaccharo-
lytica ” cells, using stearic acid with N-oxyl spin labels at differ-
ent positions in the carbon chain, showed the presence of anunusually thick (up to a depth of 12 carbons from the hydro-phobic surface) viscous surface region in the membrane bi-layer. At the 12th carbon from the polar surface, the viscoelas-tic properties changed drastically. The membrane thus has twoviscous outer regions and one ﬂuid central region, with theborder of the viscous region being located near the doublebonds or the cyclopropane rings located at carbon 11 to 12 ofthe acyl chains. Increasing the salinity caused an increase of therigidity, i.e., of the microviscosity of the polar surface in thelipid bilayer. It was suggested that the presence of thick viscousregions may be related to the need to withstand high osmoticpressure or to the requirement for a low permeability to Na
1
(121, 122, 129, 130, 167).
S. costicola does not produce cyclopropane fatty acids. Its
main fatty acids are 16:1 cis9, 16:0, and 18:1 cis11, with minor
amounts of 14:0, 17:1, and 18:0. Unsaturated fatty acids aresynthesized using the anaerobic pathway, common to most pro-karyotes. The content of 16:0 was lowest at the optimal salinityand increased at the low- and high-salt extremes of growth (0.5and 3 M); 18:1 showed an opposite trend, with the highest con-tent of monounsaturated fatty acids being found at the opti-mum salinity. For this organism, the growth phase had littleeffect on the fatty acid composition (110, 320, 322). Double-bond positional isomeric differences were found in the fattyacid compositions of PG and PE (the presence of isomers 16:1cis11 and 18:1 cis13 in phospholipids of cells grown i n3Mb u t
not in 1 M NaCl), indicating that salinity may affect the spec-iﬁcity of the fatty acid synthetase. Salinity had a greater inﬂu-ence on the fatty acid composition of PG than of PE, suggest-ing that PG and PE biosynthesis are controlled separately by aselective effect of NaCl which occurs after the CDP-diacylglyc-erol branch point (321).
(ii) Gram-positive halophilic bacteria. In the genera Marino-
coccus ,Nesterenkonia , and Halobacillus , branched-chain fatty
acids such as 15:0 and 17:0 are dominant (215). The concen-tration of these branched-chain fatty acids changes with sa-linity (294). In Marinococcus halophilus , an increase in sa-
linity caused a response similar to that found with increasedtemperature: an increase in the content of saturated fatty acids(mainly 18:0) and a decrease in the content of the branched-chain 15:0 anteiso. The content of the unsaturated 16:1 in-creased from 40.9 to 48.8% when the salt concentration wasraised from 5 to 15%. Cyclopropane fatty acids were not de-tected (213). In Planococcus strain A4a (ATCC 35671), 15:0
anteiso is the major fatty acid, and the branched-chain fattyacids make up more than 85% of the fatty acid content at allsalinities (205).
GENETICS
The lack of suitable genetic tools has classically hampered
the genetic manipulation of moderately halophilic bacteria. Thisfact was stated clearly in 1993 by Kushner (174): “. . .practicallynothing is known about their genetics. There seems to be asilent agreement among molecular biologists, who think ofhalophilic bacteria at all, that these will be very close to thenon-halophilic eubacteria in gene organization and expression.This implies that such attributes will not be affected by the highsalt concentration around, and sometimes in, the cells. If true,this would be so strange to be worth establishing. I suspect,530 VENTOSA ET AL. MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.however, that the halophilic eubacteria will eventually prove
to have their own fascinating genetic, as well as physiologicalproperties.” Some 5 years have passed since those lines werewritten, and only recently were the ﬁrst genetic systems devel-oped and optimized for moderately halophilic bacteria, pro-viding the tools to examine their genetic properties.
Genome Analysis and Physical Maps
So far, few studies on the analysis of the genome organiza-
tion of moderately halophilic bacteria have been reported. In arecent study of S. costicola E-367, large restriction fragments of
genomic DNA were separated by pulsed-ﬁeld gel electro-phoresis after digestion with SﬁI and Mbo I. The genome size
was estimated to be 2,505 kb ( SﬁI) or 2,259 kb ( Mbo I), i.e.,
about half the size reported for E. coli but similar to that de-
termined for Vibrio cholerae (199). The genome sizes of ﬁve oth-
erS. costicola strains, as determined by SﬁI digestion, ranged
from 2,100 to 2,600 kb. Analysis of the restriction proﬁles ledto the conclusion that strain E-367 harbored three plasmids(see below), as well as a megaplasmid. The DNA of S. costicola
is likely to be highly methylated because digestion with Mbo I
(which recognizes the DNA sequence GATC, and hence thedam methylase, but is inhibited by methylation) yielded veryfew cleavage sites. Different Mbo I restriction patterns were ob-
served when the strain was grown at different salinities, sug-gesting that the methylation system may be affected by thesalinity of the medium. The genome of 14 Halomonas and
Chromohalobacter strains was analyzed by the same technique
(197). The infrequently cutting restriction endonucleases SpeI
and SwaI yielded characteristic ﬁngerprints for each strain.
The genome size for 11 Halomonas strains tested ranged from
1,170 to 2,490 kb, and that for the Chromohalobacter strains
ranged from 1,170 to 2,210 kb. The macrorestriction ﬁnger-print could be a useful tool to elucidate the taxonomic positionof bacteria belonging to the Halomonas-Deleya complex.
Native Plasmids and Derived Cloning Vectors
The ﬁrst plasmid from a moderately halophilic bacterium
(pMH1, isolated from a strain of H. elongata [Fig. 2]) was re-
ported in 1992 (67). This plasmid was also found to be har-bored by H. halmophila ,H. halophila , and S. costicola . Plasmid
DNA was used to transform E. coli on media with different
antibiotics. Digestion of the plasmid DNAs from transformantsresistant to the antibiotics kanamycin, neomycin, and tetracy-cline showed a single plasmid proﬁle identical to that pMH1.Therefore, it was concluded that this plasmid encodes resis-tance to these three antibiotics. The common occurrence ofpMH1 in the four strains may reﬂect their close relationshipwithin the Halomonadaceae and their presence in the same
habitats. The occurrence of pMH1 in the parent strains wasconﬁrmed by Southern hybridization analysis.
To construct cloning vectors, screening for such plasmids
was carried out with members of the genus Halomonas (339).
Eight Halomonas strains were examined for the presence of
plasmids and megaplasmids. Three cryptic plasmids, designat-ed pHE1 (isolated from H. elongata ATCC 33174), pHI1 (from
H. israelensis ), and pHS1 (from H. subglaciescola ), were isolat-
ed (Table 7). No megaplasmids were detected.
Because of its small size, plasmid pHE1 was selected for
further characterization and construction of a shuttle vectorforHalomonas strains. Its restriction map showed 10 unique
restriction sites (Fig. 2). Hybridization experiments exclud-ed the existence of sequences homologous to pHE1 in DNAfrom other Halomonas strains, and no homology to pMH1 was
found. pHE1 does not confer resistance to 10 common anti-microbial agents, and it is unable to replicate in E. coli . There-
fore, a number of mobilizable pHE1-derived hybrid plasmidsthat could be maintained both in H. elongata and E. coli were
constructed. To generate chimeric pHS plasmids, an antimi-crobial resistance gene suitable for selection of moderate halo-philes was included by cloning the omega cassette, carryingstreptomycin/spectinomycin resistance, into the E. coli vector
pBluescript KS. To enable the mobilization from E. coli to
Halomonas spp., the oriT of the broad-host-range IncP plasmid
RK2 was incorporated, and to ensure replication in Halomo-
nas, plasmid pHE1 was included. Thus, shuttle vector pHS15
was generated as the result of a Bam HI-BglII fusion of plasmid
pHE1 in a recombinant product of pBluescript and pKS VoriT.
The vector was readily mobilized by the RK2 derivativepRK2013 to all Halomonas strains tested (339).
A cryptic narrow-host-range plasmid from C. marismortui ,
designated pCM1, that contains four restriction sites, was iso-lated (198) (Fig. 2). Lack of a selectable marker in pCM1precluded an attempt at direct transformation into E. coli .
Therefore, plasmid regions competent for self-replication wereidentiﬁed by cloning into suicide plasmids. Three suicide vec-tors were constructed from R6K plasmid-based pGP704, whichcan replicate only in strains that produce the Pir protein, anR6K-speciﬁc essential replication protein, and the trimetho-prim resistance (Tp
r) gene from plasmid pAS396. Fragments
of pCM1 were cloned into Tprderivatives of the suicide vector
pGP704, and the resulting recombinant plasmids were used totransform E. coli CC118(pir). Recombinant plasmids were sub-
sequently transferred by conjugation into different moderatehalophiles and tested for their ability to propagate in the newhosts, which are not permissive for the R6K replicon of thevector. One construct, consisting of a 6.1-kb fragment of pCM1cloned into one of the suicide vectors, was able to replicate asan autonomous Tp
rreplicon in the different hosts tested.
The minimal replicon of pCM1 was localized on a 1,600-bp
region which includes two functionally discrete regions, theoriV region and the repA gene. The oriV region, located on a
700-bp fragment, contains four 20-bp direct repeats, or iterons,adjacent to a DnaA box that is indispensable for efﬁcientreplication. In addition, it requires trans -acting functions. The
repA gene, encoding a replication protein of 289 residues, is
similar to the genes encoding the replication proteins of othergram-negative bacteria. Figure 3 shows the deletion analysis ofthe pCM1 replicon. No expression products of repA were ob-
tained with either a prokaryotic in vitro DNA-directed tran-scriptional system or an in vivo system, possibly due to productinstability (198).
Novel cloning vectors have been constructed, based on the
combination of the minimal replicon of pCM1 with the usefulproperties of plasmid pUC18 (small size, high copy number,multiple cloning sites, etc.), as well as with the Tp
rgene (an
antimicrobial selection marker different from that of pSH15).Conjugation mediated by the transfer machinery of plasmidRP4 is an efﬁcient and reliable method for the introduction offoreign DNA into moderate halophiles. Two vectors, pEE3and pEE5, were found to be suitable for use as narrow-host-range cloning vectors. Plasmid pEE5, a relatively small (7.0-kb)shuttle vector, contains unique recognition sites for ﬁve differ-ent restrictases and permits the selection of white or bluepigmented colonies, after introduction of the alpha-peptide ofLacZ from plasmid pNot18 (Fig. 2) (202).
S. costicola E-367 carries three plasmids designated pVC1,
pVC2, and pVC3 (199) (Fig. 2). On the basis of its small sizeand the presence of four unique restriction sites, pVC1 is apotential candidate for the construction of cloning vectors use-ful for S. costicola . Hybridization experiments showed thatVOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 531pVC1 is harbored only by S. costicola E-367 and is absent from
15 other S. costicola strains tested. No DNA homology among
plasmid pVC1 and plasmids pMH1, pHE1, pCM1, and pVC1could be detected.
Genetic Transfer
So far, conjugation is the only genetic transfer mechanism
described for the moderate halophiles. Natural transformationhas not been reported, and approaches such as electroporation(197) or CaCl
2treatment (338) have either been unsuccessfulor given nonreproducible results. Although some bacterio-
phages have been described for moderate halophiles, transduc-
tion methods have not yet been developed.
A major difﬁculty in the use of moderate halophiles for
genetic transfer experiments is that at their optimal salinitythey generally tolerate high concentrations of most antimicro-bial agents (223, 270, 271). However, a decrease of the salinityresulted in an enhanced sensitivity of Halomonas ,Chromo-
halobacter , and Salinivibrio strains to many antimicrobials (34,
166, 352). For nalidixic acid, spectinomycin, and tetracycline,the effect of salinity was less pronounced and strain dependent.

and 339 with permission of the publishers).532 VENTOSA ET AL. MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.All moderate halophiles tested showed a high sensitivity to
rifampin and trimethoprim, regardless of the salt concentra-tion (34). These ﬁndings greatly simplify the design of selectionmedia and facilitate the use of genes encoding resistance tosome antimicrobial agents, especially aminoglucosides, as ge-netic markers for plasmids or transposons.
Conjugation has been successfully used to transfer both na-
tive plasmid-derived vectors (198, 202, 338, 339) and broad-host-range plasmids for gram-negative bacteria (166, 338) fromE. coli toChromohalobacter ,Halomonas , and Salinivibrio . Fac-
tors affecting the transfer frequency, such as cell growth phase,mating time, donor-to-recipient ratio, and composition andsalinity of the mating medium, were evaluated to optimize theconditions for conjugation between E. coli and moderate halo-
philes (338). Table 8 summarizes the host range of the maincloning vectors reported. Whereas pHS15 (pHE1-derivative),pKT230 (IncQ), and pVK102 (IncP) were able to replicatein all hosts tested (338), pEE5 and pEE3 did not replicate inS. costicola (202), pGV1124 (IncW) was maintained only in
H. elongata , and pCU1 (IncN) could not be established in any
of the hosts tested. Since instability problems can be overcomeby growing the plasmid-carrying cells under selective condi-tions (that is, in the presence of the antibiotic whose resistanceis encoded by the plasmid), the vectors belonging to the in-
compatibility groups IncQ (pKT230) and IncP (pVK102), aswell as the three shuttle vectors, seem to be suitable tools foruse in moderate halophiles.
Conjugation between moderate halophiles has been demon-
strated by using the self-transmissible IncP plasmid RK2 (338).Transfer of this plasmid between Halomonas species was found
at frequencies up to 1.2 310
23to 2.8 31024. Intergeneric
conjugation between H. elongata and related species such as
H. eurihalina (transfer frequency of 2.0 31025) and H. halo-
phila (5.0 31025) on the same medium was also demon-
strated.
Reporter Genes
The ﬁrst gene reporter system in moderately halophilic bac-
teria was described in 1995 (7). The expression of the ice nu-cleation gene inaZ of the plant-pathogenic bacterium Pseu-
domonas syringae , a system that has proved useful in gram-
negative bacteria, was used as a reporter for promoter activityand gene expression in several moderate halophiles. A pro-moterless version of inaZ was subcloned in vector pSH15 in
both orientations and at two different restriction sites. Con-

erately halophilic strains by triparental matings in which theRK2 tragenes were provided in trans by the helper plasmid
pRK600. All moderately halophilic transconjugants harboringa pHS15 derivative expressed ice nucleation activity. One ori-entation of the inaZ constructs gave much higher activity in
H. elongata andH. eurihalina , indicating that inaZ was possibly
introduced in the correct orientation downstream of putativenative promoters. Also, a signiﬁcantly higher ice nucleationactivity was found in a recombinant construct carrying a tan-dem duplication of inaZ in the same orientation, indicating
that inaZ is appropriate for gene dosage studies. The gene was
also transferred and expressed in H. elongata andH. eurihalina
under the control of two heterologous promoters, P
bla(the
promoter of the b-lactamase of E. coli ) and Ppdc(the promoter
of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene of Zymomonas mobilis ),
yielding an ice nucleation activity comparable to that obtainedfrom the expression of the native putative promoters. It wasthus demonstrated that foreign genes can be introduced andexpressed in moderate halophiles, facilitating genetic improve-ment and strain construction. It was also shown that inaZ can
be expressed in a broad spectrum of moderate halophiles (7).
The presence of two promoters in the native plasmid pHE1
ofH. elongata , controlling the transcription of opposite orien-
tations, was postulated (7). By using the promoter analysis vec-tor pKK232-8, one of these promoters was further character-ized by direct subcloning, deletion analysis, and assaying forice nucleation and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activ-ities (324). The sequence of the region showing promoteractivity revealed the existence of two possible consensussequences ( 210 and 235) for s
70-dependent promoters of
E. coli . Accordingly, this putative promoter was functional in
this host. The identiﬁed promoter, the ﬁrst characterized froma moderate halophile, showed comparable activity to that ofthe known promoters P
blaand Ppdcwhen expressed in H. elon-
gata and H. eurihalina . Availability of a small pHE1 DNA
fragment containing a promoter sequence may be useful forthe construction of expression vectors for moderate halophiles.
Isolation of Mutants
Salt-sensitive mutants of S. costicola unable to grow at 2.5 to
3 M NaCl were isolated following UV irradiation and penicillinselection. Some of these mutants also showed an altered tem-perature range (162).
A transposon mutagenesis procedure was developed for H.
elongata (166). The suicide plasmids pSUP101 and pSUP102-Gm were used to introduce the transposons Tn 5and Tn 1732
into H. elongata viaE. coli SM10-mediated conjugation. Tn 5
proved unsuitable for transposon mutagenesis in this moderatehalophile. However, Tn 1732 , a transposon of the Tn 3family,
was useful for the isolation of mutants. Insertions occurred atdifferent sites in the chromosome. Several auxotrophic mutantswith a single requirement were generated, as well as differentsalt-sensitive mutants. Some of the salt-sensitive mutants wereable to grow in 16% NaCl medium when supplemented withglycine betaine. It was suggested that these mutants may bedefective in the genes for ectoine synthesis or its regulation(see below). One of the mutants was found to have a reducedectoine and hydroxyectoine content (166).
The killing action and induced mutagenicity of hydroxyl-
amine have been investigated in H. elongata and H. meridiana
(25). The induced mutagenicity was assessed by measuring thefrequency of appearance of mutants resistant to streptomycin(223). A number of single and double auxotrophic mutants ofH. elongata were obtained, as well as different salt-sensitive
mutants of both H. elongata and H. meridiana . Some of the
mutants appeared to be affected in the synthesis of ectoine orin the genes responsible for the regulation of compatible solutesynthesis, and others were probably deregulated mutants (25).
Genetic Basis of Osmoregulation
Accumulation of organic compatible solutes, either by de
novo synthesis of compounds such as ectoine and hydroxyec-toine or by transport of osmoprotectants from the medium, suchas glycine betaine or its precursor, choline, has been studied atthe genetic level (23, 35, 82).
Ectoine is produced from aspartate semialdehyde by the
action of
L-diaminobutyric acid transaminase, L-diaminobuty-
ric acid acetyltransferase, and L-ectoine synthase (259) (Fig. 1).
The genes encoding these enzymes have been isolated fromHalomonas sp. strain KS-3 (208), from H. elongata DSM 3043
(24), and from Marinococcus halophilus (180). To clone the
ectoine synthase gene from Halomonas sp. strain KS-3, Min-
Yu et al. (208) ampliﬁed a 90-bp product by using primersbased on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein.This region was used as a probe against genomic DNA, and a4.2-kb fragment that gave a positive hybridization signal wascloned in pBluescript II SK and the nucleotide sequence of thestructural gene encoding the ectoine synthase ( ectC) was de-
termined. The ectoine synthesis genes of M. halophilus were
cloned by functional expression in E. coli : colonies of E. coli

elevated salinity; one clone, carrying the recombinant plasmidpOSM1, was able to grow at 5% NaCl thanks to ectoine pro-duction. Sequencing of a 4.4-kb fragment of pOSM1 revealedthree open reading frames involved in ectoine synthesis: ectA,
encoding
L-diaminobutyric acid acetyltransferase; ectB, encod-
ing L-diaminobutyric acid transaminase; and ectC, encoding
ectoine synthase. The M. halophilus ectC gene had 47% iden-
tity to the corresponding gene of Halomonas sp. strain KS-3
(208). The genes were osmoregulated in E. coli , as demon-
strated by an increasing cytoplasmic ectoine concentration inresponse to salinity (180).
To identify the ectoine biosynthetic genes of H. elongata
DSM 3043, Ca ´novas et al. (24) isolated mutants blocked in its
synthesis. Two of these Tn 1732 -induced mutants accumulated
ectoine precursors, as shown by
13C-NMR and mass spectros-
copy. Mutant CHR62 accumulated low levels of diamino-butyric acid, while mutant CHR63 contained high concentra-tions of N-g-acetyldiaminobutyric acid, suggesting that strain
CHR62 could be defective in the diaminobutyric acid acetyl-transferase gene and strain CHR63 could be defective in theectoine synthase gene. The genes were isolated by colony hy-bridization, using a 370-bp chromosomal fragment ﬂanking theTn1732 insertion in mutant CHR63 as a probe against a ge-
nomic library of H. elongata . One cosmid clone thus identiﬁed
was able to complement the mutations in both CHR62 andCHR63, conﬁrming that it carried the wild-type genes encod-ing the enzymes for the synthesis of N-g-acetyldiaminobutyric
acid and ectoine. Preliminary data on the sequence of the iso-lated region revealed that the predicted protein encoded by theectoine synthase gene of H. elongata is highly homologous to
the corresponding protein sequences of Halomonas sp.
strain KS-3 and M. halophilus (22). The organization of the
ectoine synthesis genes in H. elongata , most probably con-
tained in one operon, seems to differ from that in M. halo-
philus (22, 24).
The genes encoding the transport system for glycine betaine
inH. elongata DSM 3043 have recently been isolated (22). For
this purpose, a gene bank of this organism was transferred byconjugation to an E. coli strain unable to take up glycine be-
taine and transconjugants were selected for growth in minimalmedium containing 0.75 M NaCl and 1 mM betaine. A numberof cosmid clones carrying the genes for glycine betaine trans-port were obtained. To isolate the genes of the choline-betainepathway of H. elongata , the same gene bank was used to com-
plement E. coli MKH13 harboring plasmid pJB004 (carrying
theE. coli choline transport betT gene). Three cosmid clones
were isolated that conferred to MKH13(pJB004) the ability tooxidize choline to glycine betaine, as shown by thin-layer chro-matography of cytoplasmic extracts of the transconjugants.The isolated region has been sequenced, showing that it con-tains three genes highly homologous to the betI,betB, and betA
genes of E. coli (22).
At least in some bacteria, halotolerance may be linked to the
presence of certain plasmids. Preliminary studies have indi-cated that when H. elongata was cured of its single plasmid, it
lost its ability to grow in 3.4 M NaCl (351). Similarly, a eury-haline strain designated “ Spirillum luteum ” was able to grow at
up to about 1.2 M salt. However, after plasmid curing by acri-ﬂavine treatment, growth could be obtained at up to about 0.7M only. It was concluded that salt resistance in this organism isprobably controlled by a plasmid (216, 217). It is to be regret-ted that these studies were not pursued in further depth.BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
Moderately halophilic bacteria have the potential for excit-
ing and promising applications. Not only do many of themproduce compounds of industrial interest (enzymes, polymers,and osmoprotectans), but also they possess useful physiologicalproperties which can facilitate their exploitation for commer-cial purposes. First, most of them can grow at high salt con-centrations (352), minimizing the risk of contamination. Sec-ond, they are easy to grow, and their nutritional requirementsare simple: the majority can use a large range of compounds astheir sole carbon and energy source (176). Moreover, as dis-cussed above, many of the genetic tools developed for thenonhalophilic bacteria can be applied to the moderate halo-philes, and hence their genetic manipulation seems relativelysimple. In spite of all this, the moderately halophilic bacteriahave not yet been used extensively for biotechnological pur-poses. In this section, we discuss some of the current industrialapplications of these halophiles and emphasize some expectedfuture developments.
Fermented Foods
Tetragenococcus strains are involved in the fermentation of
soy sauce. In soy sauce manufacture, ground wheat and soygrains are suspended in water with about 19% NaCl and incu-bated for up to 9 months in the dark (172). Halophilic lacto-cocci ( Tetragenococcus halophilus ) are used as starters for the
fermentation and typically develop densities of up to 10
8CFU/
ml in soy sauce mash with abou t 3 M NaCl (289, 331). Tetra-
genococcus muriatianus is involved in the preparation of fer-
mented liver sauce (304).
In the preparation of Thai ﬁsh sauce (nam pla, a food con-
diment widely used in Southeast Asia), moderate halophilesand halotolerant bacteria are used ( Bacillus spp., coryneform
bacteria, and, more rarely, pseudomonads, most of these tol-erating up to 20 to 30% salt). Extremely halophilic red archaeaare also found during the process (326).
Enzymes
As described above, a number of extra- and intracellular
enzymes from moderately halophilic bacteria have been iso-lated and characterized. These include hydrolases (amylases,nucleases, phosphatases, and proteases), which are currentlyof commercial interest. Nuclease H produced by “ M. varians
subsp. halophilus ” may be useful for the industrial production
of the ﬂavoring agent 5 9-inosinic acid and 5 9-guanylic acid
(140) by using a bioreactor system with a column of ﬂocculatedcells (241). Esterases with high afﬁnity for short-chain estersare made by a strain of H. elongata growing in Danish bacon
curing brines (118), and the isolation of novel Bacillus species
such as B. salexigens , which produces an extracellular nuclease
in saline medium (89), may also lead to the development ofindustrially promising processes.
Compatible Solutes
Moderate halophiles accumulate high cytoplasmatic concen-
trations of low-molecular-weight organic compounds to copewith the osmotic stress and to maintain positive turgor pres-sure. The ability to produce and accumulate high concentra-tions of these compounds makes moderate halophiles usefulfor the biotechnological production of these osmolytes. Somecompatible solutes, especially glycine betaine and ectoines,have gained considerable attention in recent years, becausethey may be used as stress protectants (against high salinity,VOL. 62, 1998 BIOLOGY OF MODERATELY HALOPHILIC AEROBIC BACTERIA 535thermal denaturation, desiccation, and freezing) and stabiliz-
ers of enzymes, nucleic acids, membranes and whole cells (80,82, 181). The industrial use of these compounds in enzymetechnology (biosensor technologies, PCR, etc.) and for phar-maceuticals and cosmetics is a most promising ﬁeld (84–86,346).
Ectoine and hydroxyectoine exert a remarkable protective
effect on a number of labile enzymes such as lactate dehydro-genase and phosphofructokinase. In a study with several com-patible solutes (glycine betaine, trehalose, glycerol, proline,ectoines, and sugars), hydroxyectoine showed the highest efﬁ-ciency of protection of lactate dehydrogenase against freeze-thaw treatment and heat stress whereas ectoine was the mosteffective freeze-stabilizing agent for phosphofructokinase (80,181). Ectoine and hydroxyectoine can as yet be produced onlybiologically. The production of ectoine for industrial purposesby using H. halodenitriﬁcans has recently been established
(325). Cells were grown in an anaerobic fed-batch fermenta-tion process, in a synthetic medium with glycerol at high con-centration as the carbon source. Once a high cell density wasreached, ectoine was extracted by “bacterial milking”, a pro-cess previously developed with H. elongata , in which an osmotic
down-shock from 10 to 2% NaCl is employed, resulting inexcretion of about 80% of the intracellular ectoine to thesurrounding medium (88, 305). Subsequent exposure of thecells to a hyperosmotic shock (from 2 to 10% NaCl) restoredthe original level of ectoine in a period of 10 h. Thus, a yield of2 g ectoine per liter of medium per day was obtained. Ectoineand hydroxyectoine can also be produced by the gram-positivemoderate halophile Marinococcus strain M52. A maximum
yield of 35.3 g per liter cell dry weight was reached (77). Theuse of a dialysis reactor, in which cells were grown in an innerchamber fed with ﬁsh peptone and glucose, resulted in a dra-matic increase in yield: up to 132 g of cell dry weight with about20% hydroxyectoine was obtained (164). Another organismused for the production of ectoine is the actinomycete Nocar-
diopsis lucentensis A5-1, isolated from a saline soil near Ali-
cante, Spain (179, 371).
Advances in fermentation technology and genetic engineer-
ing of moderate halophiles will allow large amounts of thesecompatible solutes to become available. As stated above, thegenes involved in the synthesis of ectoine and its regulation inhalophilic bacteria have recently been cloned (24, 179, 207),opening the way to its overproduction. It may also enable thetransfer of genes for salt and drought tolerance from moderatehalophiles to agricultural crops, such as wheat, rice, and barley,enabling them to grow in more saline soils.
Polymers
Bacterial polysaccharides are of great value as enhancers of
oil recovery because of their surfactant activity and bioemul-sifying properties. Since the conditions in oil deposits are oftensaline, the use of salt-resistant surfactants may be advanta-geous. Pﬁffner et al. (260) isolated more than 200 bacterial
strains capable of producing extracellular polysaccharides fromoilwells and oil well-associated environments. The predomi-nant type was a facultative anaerobic, as yet unidentiﬁedBacillus species, growing at up to 12% NaCl. It produced a
polysaccharide with pseudoplastic behavior, resistant to shearand thermal degradation, and showing higher viscosities at di-lute concentrations and elevated temperatures than commer-cial polymers such as xanthan gum. The polymer is a chargedheteropolysaccharide containing glucose, arabinose, mannose,ribose, and small amounts of allose and glucosamine. Produc-tion was optimal under anaerobic conditions in media with 4 to
10% NaCl.
H. eurihalina F2-7 produces large amounts of an extracellu-
lar polyanionic polysaccharide (263). The polymer, consistingof 42% carbohydrates (mostly hexoses) and 15% protein, is apotent emulsifying agent, exhibiting pseudoplastic behavior. Itforms gels of high viscosity at acid pH. In view of these prop-erties, the polysaccharide (EPS V2-7) may ﬁnd broad applica-tions in pharmaceuticals, in the food industry, and in biodeg-radation processes (21). Having a high content in sulfategroups, this polysaccharide was shown to have remarkable invitro immunomodulating activity, enhancing the proliferativeeffect of human lymphocytes as a response to the presence ofthe anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in blood (258).
Degradation of Toxic Compounds
Hypersaline waters and soils are often contaminated with
heavy metals or other toxic compounds from anthropogenicsources. Hypersaline wastewaters are generated during themanufacture of chemicals such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals,and herbicides and during oil and gas recovery processes. Con-ventional microbiological treatment processes do not functionat high salt concentrations, and therefore the use of moder-ately halophilic bacteria should be considered (250, 251).
Hydrocarbon-degrading moderate halophiles have been iso-
lated from a variety of environments, including the GreatSalt Lake (360) and Antarctic saline lakes (196). Woolard andIrvine (366) reported the utilization of a bioﬁlm of a moder-ately halophilic bacterium isolated from a saltern at the GreatSalt Lake, Utah, for the treatment of hypersaline wastewaterscontaining phenol. By using a batch bioﬁlm reactor, more than99% of the phenol was removed from a waste containing 15%salt. Benzoate and other aromatic compounds can be degradedbyH. halodurans by cleavage of aromatic rings (291). A mod-
erately halophilic bacterium isolated from a hypersaline springin Utah degrades highly toxic organophosphorus compounds.The microorganism (strain JD6.5) grew at 2 to 24% salt andwas tentatively identiﬁed as an Alteromonas strain (38). The
enzyme responsible, organophosphorus acid anhydrase, waspuriﬁed and characterized. Five additional halophilic bacteria,showing hydrolytic activity against several organophosphoruscompounds and related chemicals, were isolated (37). Suchenzymes may have considerable potential for the decontami-nation and mineralization of chemical warfare agents.
Moderate halophiles belonging to the family Halomonada-
ceae have been recently isolated from highly saline sites con-
taminated with the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid;they were able to utilize chloroaromatic compounds as sourcesof carbon and energy. One of the isolates, strain I-18, showedhigh activities of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cyclo-isomerase, and dienelactone hydrolase at about 1.0 M NaCland pH 8.4 to 9.4 (185). This strain was also able to utilizeother aromatic compounds including benzoic acid, 3-chloro-benzoic acid, and 4-chlorophenol.
Other Potential Applications
Moderately halophilic bacteria may have numerous addi-
tional potential uses in biotechnology, yet to be exploited. (i) Ithas been claimed that moderate halophiles may be used to re-move phosphate from saline environments, as a cheaper alter-native to chemical approaches (275). (ii) Moderate halophilescould be used in the recovery of hypersaline waste brines de-rived from the olive oil industry and leather- or fur-curingprocesses. (iii) They may be screened for the production ofbioactive compounds such as antibiotics. (iv) Biological surfac-
536 VENTOSA ET AL. MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.tants derived from moderate halophiles may have a variety of
applications in industry. Thus, Yakimov et al. (369) recentlyisolated a moderate halophile which synthesizes a novel glyco-lipid belonging to a powerful novel class of biosurfactants. Thebacterium (strain MM1, a member of the Halomonadaceae )
was isolated from saline water and sediment samples by en-richment on n-hexadecane. The puriﬁed surfactant is a pow-
erful surface-active agent, showing a strong positive effect onchlorinated biphenyl degradation, probably due to the solu-bilization of these compounds in water. (v) New restrictionendonucleases and other enzymes for molecular biologicalstudies are expected to be present in microorganisms fromhypersaline habitats and will be discovered and exploited. (vi)Many moderate halophiles produce orange or pink colonies,probably due to the production of carotenoids as a protectivemechanisms against photooxidation processes. Carotenoids havemajor applications in the food industry as food-coloring agentsand as additives in health food products. Therefore, investiga-tions of the utilization of moderate halophiles as producers ofcarotenoids could be of great interest.
Finally, we may note that in the last few years, considerable
economic effort has been made to facilitate the exploitationof the potentialities of extremophilic microorganisms suchas moderate halophiles. Thus, in Europe, a consortium of 39teams funded by the BIOTECH-Programme of the EuropeanCommission has recently ﬁnished a 3-year project aimed atisolating and/or selecting the extremophiles with the best po-tential for industry. In early 1997, a new project was initiated toutilize these microbes as cell factories for the production ofcommercially interesting compounds. It may be expected thatthe moderately halophilic bacteria will shortly be used rou-tinely in biotechnology as their astonishing properties are in-creasingly exploited.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Studies carried out, specially during the last decade, have
increased our current knowledge about different aspects ofmoderately halophilic bacteria, such as their physiology, ecol-ogy, taxonomy or phylogenetic relationships with other micro-organisms, and, to a lesser extent, their genetics. Besides, thereare several ﬁelds in which their industrial applications aremore promising, and, as in the case of other extremophilicmicroorganisms, they have an important biotechnological po-tential as a source of compatible solutes, enzymes, and othercompounds of industrial interest. Moreover, moderately halo-philic bacteria constitute an excellent model for the molecularstudy of the osmoregulatory mechanisms that permit them togrow over a wide range of salt concentrations. This aspect hasvery exciting potentialities, such as, for instance, their possibleapplication in agriculture to construct salt-resistant plants car-rying procaryotic genes encoding enzymes for the synthesis ofosmoprotective compounds. For all these studies, the availabil-ity of genetic tools and an in-depth knowledge of their molec-ular genetics will be necessary, and thus, this ﬁeld could beidentiﬁed currently as one of the most attractive for research-ers.
Systematic and phylogenetic studies have deﬁned a large
number of species to be included within the moderately halo-philic bacteria, distributed over at least half of the major phy-logenetic branches of the bacteria. Molecular ecology tech-niques available nowadays should be used to determine inmore detail the ecological distribution of these halophilic mi-croorganisms and the roles they play in hypersaline environ-ments, as well as their contribution to microbial transformationprocesses. The use of such techniques would enable the eluci-dation of the biodiversity of moderately halophilic bacteria and
the identiﬁcation of species that constitute the predominantpopulations in these extreme habitats.
