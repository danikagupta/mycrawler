Introduction
Dyes are intensely colored substances that can be used to
produce a significant degree of coloration when dispersed in
or reacted with other materials by a process which at least
temporarily destroys the crystal structure of the substrate.They are retained in the substrate by adsorption solution and
mechanical retention or by ionic or covalent chemical bonds
(Anon 1974).
Organic pigments are finely divided crystalline solids. They
are insoluble in the systems in which they are used, like inks,surface coatings, plastics and artificial fibres, must be disper-
sed in them with the expenditure of mechanical energy
(Schewaebel and Nordmyer 1971).
Dye Intermediates are the chemicals or substances which are
used in the synthesis of dyes and pigments. For example,intermediates used in the production of dyes and pigments
are naphthols, naphylaminophenols and many others, having
different substituents on aromatic rings and having structureas required according to their use in any class of dyes (Anon
1955).
Purpose of this review is to create awareness about the toxicity
and carcinogenicity of these synthetic dyes and intermediates
among who are manufacturing these dyes or are using them intheir goods. This review covers the literature from 1956 to2002 with all the hazardous/carcinogenic / mutagenic effectsof dyes and dye intermediates on humans and animals. Toxi-city of many intermediate chemicals are presented in Table 1
and  2. Various reports are already can be seen in the literature
(Clontero et al 1990, Anliker 1979) however, these reports lack
mechanism of toxicity induced by these synthetic dyes.

Dyes and pigments are mostly colored substances  used for coloration.The chemicals used for their synthesis are hazardous
for human life. The metabolism occurs primarily in liver and the metabolites formed are transported in the blood where theycan form protein adduct or undergo renal filtration in urinary bladder lumens where at acidic pH, they can react covalently
with DNA and the carcinogen DNA adducts formed cause disorders in the whole metabolic reactions. Many carcinogenic/
mutagenic hazards, which occur in the body, have been summarized for public awareness.

that could cause cancer of the bladder for over 25 years (Melick
et al 1955, Huang et al  1979). Studies comparing the combined
effect of chemical carcinogens on laboratory rats revealedthat concurrent, sequential or mixed quantities of compounds
targeted at liver tissue resulted in syncarcinogenic effects.
Current test of relevance to human tissue involved change inmorphology in respect of stiochiometric adducts, haemoglobin
or DNA.
Carcinogenic aromatic amine metabolism and DNA
adduct detection in humans . Initial metabolism of an
aromatic amine occurs primarily in the liver and involves N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P - 450 IA2 and N-acetylation
by acetyltransferase which serve as competing activation
and detoxification reactions, respectively. Both the enzymesare polymorphic in humans and can be readily assessed using
caffeine ingested in coffee followed by urinary metabolite
analysis. N-hydroxyarylamines can then be transported inthe blood where they can form protein adducts with
haemoglobin (Hb) or undergo renal filtration into the urinary
bladder lumen where, at acidic pH, they can react covalentlywith urothelial DNA. Carcinogen-DNA adduct levels in human
bladder are smoking-related and the C
8-substituted deoxy-
guanosine derivatives of 4-aminobiphenyl are the majorproduct formed.
Alternatively, N-hydroxyarylamines can be conjugated in the
liver by glucuronyl transferases which provides a mechanism
for biliary transport of the colon lumen where α
-glucuro-
nidases can regenerate the aglycon. In the colon mucosa,acetyltranferases can further activate the N-hydroxy metabo-
lite by O-acetylation, and persons with rapid acetylation are
known to be at higher risk for colorectal cancer. Detection ofspecific arylamine - DNA adducts in human colon should
provide direct evidence for the role of these carcinogens in
the etiology of this disese (Kadlubar 1991, Pei et al 1993).

the azo linkage. The metabolism via a reductive - cleavage
reactions has been shown in Scheme - 1.
Toxicity of Dyes and dye Intermediates.  Certain dye
intermediates e.g., substituted aromatic amines (anilines andbenzidines) are known to possess high toxicological potential.
They are classical environmental pollutants by virtue of theirhigh degree of water solubility and the large amounts produ-ced annually in the chemical industry for the synthesis of
dyes and other compounds. As a consequence of their common
usage, certain members of aromatic amines and benzidines arecommonly found not only in waste water but also in surface
water. For this reason, their accumulation in free or bound
form is also possible in sediments or suspended matter (Scholzet al 1988). Some examples given in Table 1.
Dyes.Azo and anthraquinone dyes are the major chemical
classes of commercial dyes. Among azo dyes, the direct dyesand pigments are the major classes which are derived from mono
and disubstituted anilines. Much of the research on the ecolo-
gical aspects of nitro, azo and anthraquinone dyes has shownthe potential carcinogenic risk to humans and animals.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has
also reported an evaluation of the Carcinogenic and Mutage-Table 1

and azo dyes to man. It seems clear from these reports that, as
a general rule, azo dyes which are based on these aromatic
amines and which also lack at least one sodium sulfonate(-SO
3Na) group pose a risk to man and this point is also
supported by more recent work. On the other hand, those
dyes which contain two or more hydrophilic - SO3Na groups
are non-mutagenic and non-carcinogenic (Anon 1982).
For a number of colorants e.g, the benzidine - based dyes for
which the metabolism in man and animals has been shown to
involve reductive cleavage of the azo bonds. The use of suchdyes in high-exposure applications e.g. hair dyes, children’s  wear,
finger paints, do-it-yourself dyeing or under poor working
conditions in processing plants, poses an elevated risk.
Toxicity of dye intermediates and their biochemistry.
Health Hazard Information . The ETDA members have com-
pleted the project which involved the testing of over 5000
commercial dyes during 5 - 7years and reported the acute oraltoxicity on the rats and rabbits. The analysis of short - termhealth effects showed skin and eye irritation which may occurimmediately or shortly after exposure to these aromatic amine(Hunger and Jung 1991, Sewekow 1997).
Chronic Health Effects . At present, the possible chronic
effects that attracting most of the attention are carcinogenicityand to a lesser extent sensitization. Technical dyes (excludingfood, hair, cosmetics and drug dyes), properly handled andused, are only taken up in small traces, if at all. The availableevidence  indicates that these trace quantities do not  present
any unreasonable risk. However, a risk situation could arise
due to improper handling or use. This is the main reason forETDA’s continuing efforts to identify any such product. Thechronic (long - term) health effects can occur at some timeafter exposure to these aromatic amines and can last for monthsor years (Slawomir  et al 1998).
Cancer Hazard . The aromatic amines are carcinogens in
humans and cause liver, breast, bladder intestine and skin
cancer not only in humans but in animals also (Helmes et al
1986).
Many scientists believe that there is no safe level of exposure to
a carcinogen. Such substances may also have the potential forcausing reproductive damage in humans. These compoundscaused cancer in the offspring of animals exposed during their
pregnancy. Other long - term effects may cause a skin allergy. If
allergy develops, very low future exposure can cause itchingand a skin rash (Rockeville 1984, Hillier and Rome 1986).
Acute (short-term) ecological effects . Acute toxic effects
may include the death of animals, birds or fish and death orlow growth rate in plants. Acute effects are seen after two or
four days when animals or plants come in contact with a toxic
chemical substance (Jaskot and Costa 1994).
Chronic (Long-term) Ecological effects . Chronic toxic
effects may include shortened lifespan, reproductive problems,
lower fertility and changes in appearance or behavior. Chronic
effects can be seen long after first exposure to a toxic chemical(Sun et al 1998).
Water solubility . The solubilities of these aromatic amines
is between 1 to 1,000 mg in a liter of water.
Distribution and persistence in the environment . These
compounds are moderately persistant in water, with a half -
life of between 20 to 200 days. The half life of a pollutant is theamount of time it takes for one - half of the chemical to be
degraded. About 60 - 80% of these aromatic amines will even-
tually end up in water, the rest will be divided about equallybetween terrestrial soils and aquatic sediments.
Bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms . Some subs-
tances increase in concentration or bioccumulate, in living
organisms as they breath contaminated air, drink contaminated
water, or eat contaminated food. These chemicals can becomeconcentrated in the tissues and internal organs of animals
and humans.
Biochemistry of dyes/dye intermediates and their
carcinogenicity.  There is sufficient evidence for the
carcinogenicity in experimental of these aromatic amines
animals in when administered in the diet, these aromatic amines
induced transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder inhamsters and female dogs and hepato-cellular carcinomas in
female dogs (Lakshmi et al 1995).
When administered by transplacental exposure, the compound
increased the incidences of lymphoid leukemia in mice(Kennelly et al 1982).
The dye intermediates have ability to undergo reductive
cleavage of the azo linkage. The metabolism by a reductivecleavage reaction has been shown in Scheme - 1.

Structure - toxicity relationship. The toxicity and carcino-
genic activity also depend on the structure and substitutionon biphenyls. For dyes that are carcinogenic and are resistant
to chemical attack, such as true azo dyes, the dye itself is
likely to be procarcinogen. In contrast, azo dyes which exist inthe hydrazone form are more likely to be broken down e.g.
reduced. In this case, the procarcinogen is likey to be an amine
breakdown product of the dye and the ultimate carcinogenicpotential can then be deduced from the availabitlity of a
suitable active site on the metabolite. Azo pigments because
of their extreme insolubilities are likely to be broken down,even if they exist in the hydrazone form (Gregory 1986).
A relationship also exists between structure and carcinogenic
activity of substituted benzidines. Proton acceptingsubstituents which are capable of forming intramolecularhydrogen bonds in ortho - position in relation to amino groups,decrease the carcinogenicity of the title intermediates of dyesynthesis. Lipophilicity of the compounds and electroniceffects of the substitents are found to be the main parametersof carcinogenicity. Substitution at both ortho positions 2, 6-
disubstitued aniline and 2,4,5-trimethyl aniline could preventgenotoxicity due to steric hindrance of an enzymic activationto electrophilic intermediates (Belogoro et al 1981).
Direct Dyes. It is now well established that the ability of azo
dyes to undergo reductive cleavage of the azo linkage could
lead to an indirect route of exposure to an establishedcarcinogen. The absorbance potency of these dyes, however
was the most potent of the dyes tested and their inducing
activity was much greater than that of its azo reductionproducts (Kornburst and Barfknecht 1984). The literature
surveyed contains the following reports which described work
published on the toxicity of direct dyes.
A report on the toxicology and carcinogensis properties of
C.I. Direct blue 14 and 15 was published under the national
toxicology programe. The rats were fed these dyes in drinkingwater and the experimental results showed a clear evidence
of carcinogenic activity, as indicated by benigu and malignant
neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal’s gland, preputial gland, liver,oral cavity and small and large intestine. Increased incidences
of mononuclear cell leukemia and neoplasms of the brain may
have been related to chemical administration (Anon 1992,1993).Table 3

   salt80 S Waheed, G R KhanA thirteen-week subchronic toxicity studies were conducted
on direct blue 6 (Anon 1974), direct black 38 and direct brown
95 by administering the test chemicals in feed to rats and mice.
Deaths occurred among rats but not among mice during thetest period. In rats, neoplastic lesions of the liver, hepatocellular
carcinomas and neoplastic nodules, occurred only in the
treated groups (Roben et al 1980).
In an investigation, the textile dyes, Navy blue M3R(I) and
direct brown 2G(2), not only reduced the percentage of seed
germination in Vigna radiata  (L.) but also suppressed various
morphological, biochemical and physiological parameters. Iaffected the various parameters more adversely than 2. The
adverse effects of both dyes were higher in black soil than in
red soils (Wilczek et al 1992). Toxicological and carcinogenesis
studies were conducted by adiministering direct blue 218 in
feed to groups of male and female rats in Salmonella typhi-
murium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and Dorsophila
melanogaster  and their carcinogenic and toxic effects are
reported (Anon 1994).
The azo reductase activity of a cell - free extract of  Fusobacte-
rium sp.2 was characterized using trypan blue (I) as a subs-
trate. Either chemical reduction of this dye with sodium
hydrosulfite or reduction by the cell-free extract produces amutagenic product, o -tolidine. The o - tolidine is mutagenic
in the Ames Salmonella  / mammalian - microsome mutagenicity
test when activited by a rat liver S9 preparation (Hartman et al
1978).
The effects of prenatal administration of the benzidine-based
dyes which are Congo red, Diamine blue and Chlorazil black E,whereas, the dimethylbenzidine-based dyes include: Trypanblue, Evans blue and Benzopurpurin 4B and dimethoxyben-zidine-based were investigated, whereas, Chicago sky blue,Azoic diazo component 48, a dimethoxybenzidine congener,two diazo dyes , Naphthol blue black  and Sudan III were tes-ted for developmental testicular toxicity.  In mice and rats,prenatal exposure to the dye, Congo red permanently reducesthe number of germ cell in male and female offspring. In thisstudy, the structural component of the dyes responsible forthe parental induction of germ cell aplasia was identified. Onlybenzidine-based dyes altered testicular development andcaused hypsopermatogenesis in mice during adulthood.Dimethyl-and dimethoxybenzidine based dyes were withouteffect (Gray et al 1993).
β -Amyloid peptides are neurotoxic when applied to primary
cultures of hippocampal neurons from the embryonic rat. Thisneurotoxic effect can be inhibited completely by certain diazodyestuffs. The most potent of these are Congo black(I) andCongo rubin, while direct garnet and sodium-4-aminonaph-thalene-1- sulfonate are inactive. I also inhibits the neurotoxic
effects of the human pancreatic amyloidogenic peptide amy-lin. It is postulated that these dyes, by interacting with the(- pleated sheet structure of amyloidogenic peptide, preventaggregation and hence neurotoxicity (Bargevin et al 1994). In
a similar study the gonadal effects of fetal exposure to the azodye Congo red (I) in mice was investigated. This studydescribes the relationship between gonadal agenesis andfertility in male and female mice exposed to the diazo dye (I).Maternal (I) treatment inhibited testicular and ovarian functionin the offspring after oral administration. It was found thatprenatal exposure to the dye (I) affects the gonads of bothmale and female offspring, but only the female offspring displayreduced fertility (Gray et al 1992).
Food colors.  The toxic effects of nine natural food dyes on
Paramecium caudatum  showed the inhibitory effects on
leucine aminopeptidase acid phosphatase and esterase in vitro
and were proportional to the toxic effects of the dyes expressedin terms of the survival time of  P. caudatum  (Chughtai et al
1993). In a similar studies, the toxic effect of Xanthene dyes
containing halogen atoms were found to be more toxic thanother types of food dyes. Phloxin and Rose Bengal (containing
chlorine) were particularly toxic. The inhibitory effect of food
dyes on leucine aminopeptidase were not consistent with theirtoxic on A.salina. On the other hand, the inhibitory effects of
food dyes on lactate dehydrogenase in vitro were consistent
with the toxic effects of the dyes on A. salina (Sako et al 1979).
The carcinogenic effect of Metanil Yellow on albino mice have
developed hemangioendotheliosarcoma in 80% of the female
albino  mice and none in males after feeding them food colouradditive for 1 year at a dose of 3.0 g / kg body weight. Degene-
rative changes and metastates were also observed in other
important vital organs of the body such as stomach, ileum,rectum, liver, spleen, kidney and ovary (Prasad and Rastogi
1982).
A skin painting studies in mice was conducted with 14 Food,
C, D and C colours: FD and C blue No. 9, red No.10, red No.19
& red No. 21, red No. 27 and red No. 31, red  No. 36, orange No.5, orange No. 10 and orange No. 17. These 14 cosmetic colour
were submitted to dermal toxicity testing. Dosage levels were
based on lipstick use determination made in a group of humanfemale volunteers. The groups of lipstick colors were divided
into 3 treatment series and painted on twice weekly to an area
6 cm. A total of 1400 mice were used comprising groups of 100mice (50/sex) plus an additional pos. control group of the same
size and a vehicle control group of 300 mice (150/sex). All
colours were prepared at 1.0% suspensions in water. The pos.control received benzo[a] pyrene(1) dissolved in acetone.81 Toxicity of DyesSurvival was approximated equivalent in all experimental
groups except the pos. controls who died earlier which was
consistent with survival recorded by others for I-treated mice.
Extramedullary hematopoiesis was found in all treated groups,equivalent to the findings in the controls. The repeated
application of 0.1 ml containing 1.0% dye did not increase the
incidence of neoplasia when compared to controls in any ofthe groups receiving application of the 14 days (Carson et al
1984).
The mutagenicity of food colors in the Ames/ Salmonella  of
14 food dyes tested, including Methylene green 203A,
Strawberry red 1023, Purple red 0048, Raspberry red 0059 and
Black 0051 was determined but none was mutagenic. In anotherinvestigation, the effect of food colors on the induction of
sex-linked recessive lethal mutation with Dorsophila mela-
nogaster (Rapic et al 1985) was determined of 13 food dyes
tested, inclusive Citronine rose 200A, Methylene green 203A,
Black 0051, Purple red 0048, Strawberry red 1023 and Raspberry
red 0059, none were mutagenic in a sex-linked recessive lethalmutation test with D. melanogaster  (Vijosevic et al 1985). In a
similar report, the results of in vivo study on mammalian
chromosomes of genotoxicity of 16 food dyes tasted, includingRaspberry red 0059, Orange color 963, Strawberry red 1023,
Citron rosy 200 A and Chocolate brown 1022, none was geno-
toxic to bone marrow cell chromosomes when given to mice asa single dose of a 1% aqueous solution (Jankovic et al 1985).
The mutagenic evaluation of Orange color 963, Vanilla red
0050, May green 1025, Black 0051 and Methylene green 203Aby the micronucleus test (no of polychromatic and normo-
chromatic erythrocytes containing micronuclei) with rats only
1 (Black / 0051) increased the percentage of erythrocytes withmicronuclei indicating mutagenic activity by this dye
(Savkovic et al 1985). In another investigation, the influence
of 16 food colors on the induction of dominant lethal mutationand spermatozoid abnormality in mammals was also deter-
mined. None of 16 tested food dyes reduced fertility or caused
spermatozoid abnormalities. No significant changes indominant lethal mutations were induced. The dyes tested
included Orange color 963, Vanilla red 0050, May green 1025,
Black 0051 and Methylene green 203A (Konishi et al 1992,
Dillion et al 1994).
The carcinogenicity testing of Food red No.106 (acid red) (I)
in male and female rats were determined. Body and organ
weights, hematology, urinalysis and histopathological
evaluations do not reveal any evidence of adverse effectsassociated with the compound relative to the untreated
controls. The spectrum, incidence and histology of tumors
developing in both treated and control animals were consistentwith spontaneous incidences reported in this strain of rat.This study thus indicates that (I) is not carcinogenic to F 344
rats after 2 year of dietary administration at a maximal level of
5.0% in the basal diet by weight (Osman et al 1984).
The effect of feeding synthetic food and drug colorants
belonging to four different chemical classes i.e. Brilliant black
(BK), Brilliant blue (B), Erythrosine (Er) and Indigo carmine
(In) were studied. Groups of male and female mice were fed-libitum diets mixed with the synthetic food colorants. The
activities of liver and heart tissues were inhibited in male and
female mice relative to control and males were more affectedthan females. The blood hemoglobin (Hb) content was
increased under the effect of the 4 synthetic food colorants in
the order: Er > Bk > In > Bl as well as the red blood cells whilewhite blood cell count were increased relative to control in
male and female mice. Pathalogical and histopathological
changes were observed either in female or male organsespecially in the liver and stomach. Some changes were found
in the liver tissues and cell nucleus (polynucleus) in addition,
enlargement of the stomach size was also evident (Nishiuchi1984).
The toxicity of 25 dyes on freshwater organisms was tested.
These synthetic dyes used in food was tested on carp
(Cayprinus cariop ), Dephnia carinata , Indoplanorbis
exustus, larvae of Sympetrum frequens  and tadpoles of toad
(Bufo bufo ) and frog ( Rana brevipoda porosa ). With the
exception of the effect of Food Black No. 105 (Rose Bengal)on carp, all the tested dyes showed very low toxicity to alltested fresh water organisms with median lethal concentration
value (LC50) of > 40 ppm (Wagner et al 1995).
Basic and Solvent Dyes . The potential for methylene blue
genotoxicity was investigated in two mammalian test systems.Different concentrations of Methylene blue were prepared in
plasma (heat-treated at 56
°C for 1h to reduce cytotoxicity) and
used, without illumination, in an in vitro mouse lymphoma
cell assay designed to detect forward mutations in the geneencoding thymidine kinase. The assay was performed in thepresence and absence of rat liver microsomal fraction.Methylene blue did not increase the frequency of micronuclei
in polychromatic red cells harvested from bone marrow. It is
mutagenic in cultured mammalian cells (Michaels et al 1985).
The toxicity and sorption of 5 azo and triphenylmethane dyes
named as Basic violet 1(I), Basic violet 2, Basic violet 3, Basicgreen 4 and Tropaeolin O were established by determiningthe percent to fresh water microbiota and determined the risks,
that these dyes may pose to the aquatic environment. Basic
violet 3 was the most toxic, with a mean survival rate of 20.7%at a dye concentration of 5.0 mg/l. Tropaeolin O was the leasttoxic, with a survival rate of 92.0%. Survival increased with82 S Waheed, G R Khandecreasing dye concentration equilibrium. Partition coefficients
were higher for viable cells than for heat-killed cells, suggesting
that a metabolic process may be involved in sorption of these
dyes or that autoclaving the cells reduces the organisms’ cationexchange capacities (Milanova et al 1997).
Aquatic toxicity effects of dyes used in the manufacture of
news print and telephone directory-grade papers were studiedon luminescent bacteria, rainbow trout and activated sludges.
The results showed that triphenyl methane dyes, used in
making telephone directory-grade papers inhibited respirationof flora in activated sludge at higher concentrations not likelyto exist in mill effluents. Data from microtox tests agreed withfish toxicity data (Ahmed et al 1985).
The toxicity of Aniline blue, Methylene blue, Xanthene, Eosin
and Fuchsin dyes against the cotton leaf worm ( Spodoptera
littorialis ) was investigated for their possible use in
combination with pyrethroids. Deltamethrin was the mosteffective against ( S. littoralis ) 4
th instar larvae followed by
flucythrinate and cypermethrin, whereas, Aniline blue and
Methylene blue showed higher toxic index than Xanthinefollowed by Eosin and Fuchsin. The joint action studies
demonstrated strong synergism in mixtures of deltamethrin
with Fuchsin, Methylene blue or in the mixture of Flucythrinatewith Xanthine or Eosin. The other combinations indicated
only additive joint action (Vachalkova 1996).
The reduction of some triphenylmethane dyes and their
potential carcinogenic activity was examined in strictlyanhydrous solutions in the absence and presence of α-lipoic
acid. The highest potential carcinogenicity values determined
for Crystal violet and Methyl violet are found to be 0.420 and0.440, respectively (Selyuzhitskii et al 1982).
A study was conducted to find out the blastomogenic
properties of Basic blue K (1) on animals. I induced formationof 2 tumors in 2 males of 10 and 10 tumors in 7 females of 13;
no tumors were developed in control animals (Zimina and
Pavlenko 1991).
The toxic and mutagenic effects of arylmethane dyes Victory
blue (C.I. 44040), Methyl violet (C.I. 42535) and Brilliant green
(C.I. 42040) and the carcinogenic aminoazo dye Chrysoidin(C.I. 14270) were evaluated. All the dyes exhibited high toxicity
(as cell killing and growth inhibition) and increased the
frequency of nuclear point mutations and cytoplasmicmutations of respiratory deficiency (Serova et al 1992).
The frequency of neoplasms and chromosomal aberrations
(CA) in the liver and bone marrow were investigated afteradministration of carcinogenic O-aminoazotoluene (OAT) and
non-carcinogenic analog - 4 - aminoazo-toluene (AB) to maleand female rats in the early postnatal period. AB increase of
CA in the liver was small (although substantial in males), but
the increase was high in the bone marrow of both sexes. In
contrast, OAT increase of CA was higher in the liver than thatin the bone marrow and it was higher in the males. In addition,
OAT induced greater number of hepatic neoplasm in the males.
Both these effects of OAT in males suggest a relation betweenits mutagenic and carcinogenic properties (Kaledin et al 1994;
Ashby et al 1994).
The evaluation of Butter yellow (4-dimethylaminoazobenzene)
(I) and 12 of its structural analog were made in a cell trans-
formation assay. The in vitro results agreed with long-term
animal data for 8 compounds, but disagreed in finding I-4
sulfonic acid and sodium salts, 4-trifluoromethyl-I and 4-die-thylaminoazobenzene pos. 9-Phenylazotoluidine andN-methyl-5-phenylazoindoline may have carcinogenicpotential and 3,5-dimethyl-4-aminozobenzene-4-sulfonic acid
may be noncarcinogenic. Addition of azobenzene to the in
vitro assay medium increased the transforming potency of I
25-fold. This assay cannot be relied upon to predict the in
vivo potency of a carcinogen (Sandhu and Chipman 1991).
The role of oxidation and azo reduction in the activation of
Chrysoidine (I) dyes to genotoxic products. The enzymes
involved in metabolic activation of (I) azo dye to genotoxicproducts were investigated. The mutagenicity of thecomponent 2,4-diamino-3-methylazobenzene in Salmonella
typhimurium  strain TA 100 potentiated > 4-fold. The results
indicate a role for cytochrome P - 450 particularly, cytochrome
P - 448 in metabolic activation of these dyes and indicate that
azo reduction was a detoxification process. Neverthless, theoral and injected dosing of Chrysoidine to rats led tounscheduled DNA synthesis in hepatocytes (Collier et al
1993).
The mechanism of azoreduction of p-dimethylamino-
azobenzene (I) dye carcinogens was conducted by rat livermicrosomal cytochrome P - 450. To elucidate the mechanismsinvolved, the reduction of structurally related azobenzenesby hepatic microsomes was investigated. High substratereactivity was observed for I, its corresponding secondary(II) and primary (III) amines and p-hydroxyazobenzene (IV). In
contrast, only negligible rates were obtained for unsubstitutedazobenzene (V), hydroazobenzene (VI), p-isopropylazobenzene
(VII) and (VIII), the benzoylamide derivatives of III. Theseresults clearly indicate that electrons-donating groups, suchas hydroxyl or primary, secondary and tertiary amines, areessential for binding of azo dye carcinogens to liver microsomalcytochrome P - 450 and by implication, their enzyme reduction.No inhibition of azoreduction of I and IV was obtained by83 Toxicity of Dyesaddition of VII, V or IV to the reaction mixture. In contrast,
very weak binding was observed for the unreactive compoundsVII, VIII, V, VI. Thus, there is good correlation between bindingand substrate reactivity. The apparent lack of binding mayexplain the inability of the non-reactive compounds to inhibitazoreduction. The difference in the reduction rate observedfor V vs. IV suggested that hydroxylation would facilitate the
reduction of an otherwise non-reactive azo dyes (Zbaida et al
1989, Anon 1992).
Pigment and vat dyes . Under National Toxicology Prog-
ram (NTP), a technical report on the toxicology and carcino-
genesis studies of C.I. Pigments red 3(I) in rats and mice isprepared. Under the condition of 2-year feeding studies, there
was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of (I) in male rats
as exhibited by increased incidences of benign pheochromocy-tomas of the adrenal gland. The marginal increase in the inci-
dences of squamous cell papillomas of the skin and Zymbal’s
gland carcinomas may have been related to (I) administration.There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of (I) in
female rats as indicated by the increased incidence of hepato-
cellular adenomas. There was some evidence of carcinogenicactivity of (I) in male mice as exhibited by the increased inci-
dences of tubuler adenoma of the renal cortex and follicular
cell adenomas of the thyroid glands. There was no evidenceof carcinogenic activity of (I) in female mice that received
12,500, 25,000 or 50,000 ppm. The incidences of mononuclear
cell leukemia and preputial gland tumors in male rats andmononuclear cell leukemia, mammary gland fibroadenoma and
clitoral gland tumors in female rats were lower in the exposed
groups. The incidences of liver foci were markedly increasedin exposed male and female rats. The severity of nephropathy
was observed in male and female mice, cytomegaly (kary-
omegaly) of renal tubule epithelium was observed in malemice. Thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia occurred with an
increased incidence in male and female mice receiving (I)
(Anon 1994).
In a similar study, toxicology and carcinogenesis of C.I. Pig-
ment Red 23(I) was determined in rats and mice. Under theconditions of the 2-year feed studies, there was equivocal
evidence of carcinogenic activity of (I) in male rats as evi-
denced by a marginally increased incidence of renal tubulecell neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activ-
ity of (I) in female rats fed diets containing 10,000, 25,000 or
50,000 ppm. The severity of kidney nephropathy was increasedin exposed male rats. In mice, (I) caused an increased in hyper-
keratosis and epithelial hyperlasia of the forestomach (Hofman
and Schmidt 1993).
The possible metabolism of Pigment Yellow 17(I), a 3,3´-
dichlorobenzidine based pigment was investigated afterinhalation exposure in rats. Rats were exposed by inhalation
to the technically highest administrable concentration of 230mg (I) / m
3 air for 4 h. Inhalability of the dust was guaranteed
by a mass - median aerodynamic diameter of 1.0 - 1.1 m. For 14
days after exposure, urine and serum samples were analyzedfor 3,3´-dichlorobenzidine, the parent carcinogenic amine of
the test compound. No 3,3 ´-dichlorobenzidine could be detec-
ted either in urine of blood, the detection limit being 5 mg/mlfor both media. Based on the results of this study there is no
evidence for metabolic cleavage of (I) to 3,3 ´-dichlorobenzidine
in the rat (Kurlyanskii et al 1988).
The water-soluble phthalocyanine dyes are found to be low
toxic and are not very harmful. The copper phthalocyanine
derivatives-disulfonic acid, trisulfonic acid reactive turquoise
2 Z and reactive turquoise K affected hepatic mitochondrialelectron transport chain. Toxicological properties of dyes are
also described (Rannung et al 1992).
The presence of genotoxic and bioactive components in in-
digo-dyed fabric was examined. Extractions of pure cottonand jean fabrics were tested for mutagenicity in Salmonella
typhimurium  strains TA 98 and TA 100. Synthetic indigo, indi-
rubin and isatin were tested in competition expermients in
vitro. The mutagenicity of the indigo dyed fabric was depen-
dent on type and treatment of the fabric. Extracts of both
bleached and nonbleached jeans gave mutagenic effects onTA 98 (S9 and TA 100 S9). The greatest effects were seen in
the presence of S9. Indigo can, therefore, still be a potential
health risk either by eliciting toxic effects of other compoundsor by being a non - genotoxic carcinogen. The world wide use
of jeans with a possible exposure of a large population to
genotoxic and biological active components emphasizes theneed for a more thorough characterization of these effects
(Conde et al 1984).
The contact dermatitis was determined in 3 patients induced
by the use of dyed textiles or by occupational exposure to azodyes p-aminoazobenzene (I), disperse yellow 3, disperse orange
3, diazodiethylaniline and diazodimethylaniline (Kosaka et al
1991).
Miscellaneous . The genotoxic components of commercially
available synthetic dyes were examined. Dyes which showedtoxicity were separated on silica gel coated plates and thegenotoxicity of each component was examined. Among thedyes examined, the main component of Disperse red 73 showedgenotoxicity. In the case of 5 other dyes, Acid black 26, Acidblack 50, Acid brown 2, Disperse red 145 and Disperse red157, a minor component of Disperse violet 52 was not deter-mined because of the insolubility of its main component(Wedzisz and Grzelka et al 1988).84 S Waheed, G R KhanLD50 (96 h) values of Mordant black 11, Basic brown 1 and
Disperse yellow 1 in guppies ( L. reticulatus ) were found to be
4.02, 3.06 and 3.74 mg / l, respectively; thus the dyes have
moderate toxicity to fish. LC50 of Mordant black 15, Acid
violet 7, Acid black 26, Acid yellow 44, Acid violet 49, Acidblue 7 and Direct black 32 and 151 were > 400mg/l; these dyes
can be considered non-toxic (Kour et al 1993).
The mutagenicity testing of textile (azo) dyes with Salmo-
nella / microsome assay. Five textile azo dyes-Acid violet 17,
Acid green 16, Acid red 85, Acid red 114 and Direct green 6
were tested for bacterial mutagenicity with S.typhimurium
TA98 and TA100 strains using a plate incorporation assay.After testing over the concentration range 1 - 500 mg with and
without metabolic activation these dyes showed no mutage-
nicity or toxicity (Flammang et al 1992).
Dyes intermediate toxicity . The DNA adduct levels were
determined in congenic rapid and slow acetylator mouse
strains following chronic administration of 4-aminobiphenyl.The levels of the hepatic DNA adducts were 2-fold higher in
the liver of the female as compared to the male animals. The
DNA adducts also increased with the dose in bladder of themale mice, but in contrast to the liver, the adduct levels were
2-fold lower in the bladder DNA of the female mice (Hughes
et al 1992).
New thiophene analogs of benzidine and 4-aminobiphenyl
have been tested for their carcinogenicity in the Salmonella
revere-mutation assay Ames and the cell-transformation as-
say of styles. Their activity profiles in vitro were consistent
with their known potential carcinogenicity. The possible car-cinogenicity of the analogs in vivo is discussed (Ashby et al
1978).
3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (I) is one of five chemi-
cals being evaluated in 2-years carcinogenicity and toxicity
studies as part of NTP’s Benzidine Dye initiative. Toxicology
and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering(I) (approximately 99% pure) in drinking water to groups of
rats of each sex, whereas, Genetic toxicology studies were
conducted in Salmonella typhimurium , Chinese hamster ovary(CHO) cells and Drosophila melanogaster . Hematology and
serum chemical analyses and thyroid hormone determinationswere conducted and the results indicated a rapid declining of
animal survival (Anon 1991).
It has been reported that the carcinogen 3,3 '-dichlorobenzi-
dine is bioactivated in the liver in vivo and in vitro to mutage-
nic and lipid - binding metabolites. To characterize the meta-bolites involved, adult male rats with treated with a single
dose of either DBC, the spin trap 1-phenyl-N-tert - butylnitrone
(PBN) and both chemicals. It is concluded that in the rat arylradicals may be the predominant stable radicals from aryla-
mines in the liver, whereas, radicals derived from N-oxygena-
tion may predominate in the blood. The tissue distribution ofthe two may predominate in the blood. The tissue distribution
of the two radical species may reflect the major site of their
formation from some arylamines in the rat (Iba et al 1991).
The non-genotoxic rodents of the potent bladder carcino-
gens, o-anisidine and p-cresidine has been reported which
indicated that the genotoxicity of o-anisidine was acknowl-
edged and misquoted data cited (Bolcsfoldi et al 1992). In
another studies, the mutagenicity of o-anisidine to the blad-
der of lacl transgenic mice was also conducted. A single oral
administration of the maximum tolerated dose level (750 mg/
kg) of o-anisidine to mice yielded negative results in 32P -
post - labelling assays of bladder and liver DNA (24 h after
dosing). The possibility that o-anisidine is mutagenic and car-
cinogenic to the rodent bladder via formation of radical spe-cies is suggested (Sasaki et al 1994).
The toxicities of chloroanilines to Photobacterium  phos-
phoreum was determined and their correlations with effects
on other organisms and structural parameters using the Mic-
rotox assay was presented. The values obtained correlated
well with the toxic effects of these compounds to 4 differentspecies of yeast and with the effects of the octanol / water
partition coefficient (Ashby 1992).
The toxicity, DNA binding and adduct formation of chloro-
aniline and 4,4 ´-methylene - bis (2 - chloroaniline) has been
found and the data showed DNA damage in cultured explantsTable 4

damage in human bladder was higher than that in the dog. 33
P-postlabeling analyses indicated that Methylene-bis (2-
chloroaniline) forms several DNA adducts in both human anddog bladder tissues. These results suggest caution in the
occupational exposure of humans to Methylene-bis (2-
chloroaniline) (Ribo and Kaiser 1983).
The aromatic amine metabolism catalyzed by prostaglandin
H synthase (PHS) was investigated as an enzyme system
responsible for the conversion of carcinogens to reactivemetabolite(s) in extrahepatic tissues. The bladder carcinogens
benzidine 2-aminofluorene, and 2-naphthylamine are oxidized
by PHS to free radicals. Metabolic activation of carcinogenicaromatic amines catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P - 450 pro-
ceeds via an N-hydroxylation pathway analogous to other
well - studied aromatic amine carcinogens. PHS - catalyzedmetabolism of these compounds results in the formation of
reactive species which bind covalently to cellular macromols
(Stoner et al 1988).
The metabolism of naphthylamines in isolated rat hepato-
cytes has been studied and compared in freshly isolated
hepatocytes from 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) - treated anduntreated rats. At 10 (M, 2-naphthylamine was mainly N-
acetylated and N-glucuronidated. Minor pathways led to
C-oxidation and N-oxidation. In hepatocytes, from MC-treated rats total metabolism was slightly affected (1.5-
fold increase). Similar experiments were carried out with 1-
naphthylamine. Its N-glucuronide was the predominantmetabolite (68%) followed by the N-acetylated compound
(15%) while C-oxide was low and N-oxidized metabolites
could not be detected, even after induction. Thus, MCtreatment markedly shifted 2-naphthylamine metabolism
from N-acetylation and N-glucuronidation to N-and C-oxi-
dation. In the case of 1-naphthylamine metabolism, exten-sive N-glucuronidation together with the lack of N-oxida-
tion may prevent carcinogenesis (Eling et al 1987). In a
similar study, rat peritoneal macrophages were incubatedwith 2-naphthylamine (I), a well known carcinogen and
respiratory burst was studied. (I) induced a time and dose-
dependent stimulation of superoxide anion productionwhich was suppressed by superoxide dismutase treatment.
Other observations were as follow (i) the simultaneous
presence of polymyxin B and stauros-porine inhibitors ofprotein kinase C, inhibited (I)-dependent O
2 -production;
(ii) NADPH-oxidase contained in postnuclear fraction from
(I)-incubated macrophages showed a greater activity thancontrol fractions; (iii) the stimulation of O
2 -production eli-
cited by (I) was several-fold enhanced in activated mac-
rophages compared to resident cells. These data suggestthat (I) produces the activation of NADPH-oxidase through
protein kinase C (Orzechowski et al 1992).
The toxicity of toluidine isomers have been determined. It has
been reported that p-toluidine was 2-fold more toxic than the
ortho and meta isomers according to LD50 in rats, mice and
rabbits. The m-toluidine had the most damaging effect on blood
composition, followed o-toluidine and p-toluidine. The last
also showed some hepatotoxicity. The meta isomer somewhat
impaired the N excretion by the kidney. Skin resorption fol-
lowed the order ortho > meta > para. The most local irritating
action in rabbit eye was shown by m-toluidine (Chiara and
Sobrino 1992). In similar work, the author have re-evaluated
the carcinogenicity of o-toluidine and presented the evidence
of carcinogenicity/genotoxicity of o-toluidine (Vashenko et
al 1977). The preventions of occupational urinary bladder
tumours in the manufacture of toluidines were investigated.The results of experimental, hygienic and occupational - patho-
logy investigations indicate the carcinogenic nature of o-tolui-
dine. A most effective measure for radically improving work-ing conditions is the use of the catalytic method. The maxi-
mum perimissible concentration of I should be revised, taking
into account its carcinogenic activity.
Among the aromatic amines examined, the mutagenicity was
in the order: 3,3 '-dichlorobenzidine > toludine > benzidine> 2-
naphthylamine. Dichlorobenzidine was extremely mutagenicin the Ames assay with Salmonella typhimurium  TA 98 with
S9 microsomal activation. The last 2 aromatic amines were
moderate mutagenicity. Tobias acid and 2,2 ', 4,4'-tetra-
aminobiphenyl gave negative results with S. typhimurium  TA
98 and 100 stains and with or without S9 microsomal activa-
tion. The carcinogenicity of these compounds was in the sameorder as their mutagenicity of these compounds. Plus tobias
acid and tetra-aminobiphenyl were not carcinogenes.
Conclusion
The primary motivation for the design of novel, marketable
dyes and pigments have been the need for colorants havingimproved technical performance. In more recent years, consu-
mers are getting awareness of the hazards of synthetic dyes
and pigments. It has therefore, become clear that the toxico-logical properties of dyes and their precursors must also be
factored into the dye design equation. This means that the
development of environmentally friendly colorants mustembrace all aspects of the life cycle of synthetic dyes, from
manufacture through dye application and handling of resi-
dual dye bath color. In this regard, it is also clear that dyechemists must continue to work closely with genetic toxicolo-
gists and environmental toxicologists to assure the viability
of our industry without compromising human health or the86 S Waheed, G R Khanenvironment. It is the role of dye chemists to work especially
closely with genetic toxicologists to enhance our understand-
ing of the nature of the binding site(s) with which azo dyes
interact en route to eliciting a genotoxic response. The ability to
define these sites and develop working models would shed
light on the reason that closely related dye structures can
differ significantly in genotoxicity. Many efforts have beenmade to meet this challenge and synthesize intermediates to
develop non-genotoxic dyes. It should also be excersied to
handle these intermediates properly to prevent/reduce thehealth   risks.
