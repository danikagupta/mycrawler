solution;seizureBackground: Acute seizures are readily recognizable episodes requiring urgent treatment. This
study was conducted to compare the efﬁcacy and safety of suppository use of rectal diazepam
solution [Stesolid rectal tube (SRT), Alpharma, Inc., Lierskogen, Norway] with those of intra-venous diazepam (IVD), Li Ta Pharma Co, Ltd., Taichung, Taiwan for control of acute seizures
in children with intractable epilepsy.
Methods: Subjects were patients, aged 1 e18 years, with intractable epilepsy under at least
three kinds of antiepileptic treatments. Caregivers were trained to rectally administer SRTor IVD (dosage varying from 0.2 to 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) and to monitor respi-
ration condition, seizure severity, and adverse drug effects.
Results: Among the 24 subjects, 9 males and 15 females, treated for a period of 3 months, the
ages ranged from 2 to 18 years, with a mean of 9.1 years. Seizure types were generalized tonic
and/or clonic. Seizure frequency varied from once per week to 20 times per day. Twenty-one
(87.5%) of them had mental retardation and/or developmental delay, and 103 of the 127

cessation of seizures within 10 minutes. Each ﬁrst dose failed to control seizures in 24 and
13 episodes, respectively. A second dose of IVD achieved cessation of seizure in 21 of the 24
episodes and a second dose of SRT in 12 of the 13 episodes within another 10 minutes. Fourepisodes (3 with rectal IVD and 1 with SRT) of prolonged seizure beyond 20 minutes neededIVD injection at our emergency room. Sedation occurred in 17% of patients, which was attrib-
uted to IVD in 8% and SRT in 9% of patients. No respiratory depression was attributable to IVD or
SRT. There was no signiﬁcant statistical difference in efﬁcacy and safety between these twoforms of diazepam.
Conclusion: Rectal diazepam solution, administered by capable caregivers, is as effective and
safe as rectal administration of IVD for children with intractable epilepsy.

1. Introduction
The management of acute seizures usually demands
immediate administration of appropriate antiepilepticsfor avoiding status epilepticus.
1e4Although intravenous
administration is usually preferred, it is not always acces-sible, even when patients are staying in the hospital with noavailable intravenous route, not to mention seizures
happening outside the hospital. The rectal route is another
choice for administration of antiepileptics. Rectal admin-istration of intravenous diazepam (IVD) has been proved to
be effective by a previous report.
3However, the procedure
to prepare for rectal administration of diazepam from
intravenous glass ampoule is inconvenient and time
consuming. Rectal diazepam gel has been well evaluated
and reported before.5,6The purpose of this study was to
compare the efﬁcacy and safety of a different form ofdiazepamd rectal diazepam solution carried in a soft
plastic tubed with those of a previously used rectal
administration of IVD for terminating seizures in childrenwith intractable epilepsy.
2. Materials and Methods
This study was permitted by our Institutional Research
Committee. The criteria for eligibility were children aged
from 1 to 18 years, with intractable epilepsy under at leastthree kinds of rational antiepileptics, and absence of liver,
pulmonary, and cardiovascular diseases.
One of our ﬁve pediatric neurologists evaluated each
potentially eligible child, conﬁrmed his or her eligibility,reviewed a questionnaire on the child’s history previously
completed by a caregiver, and obtained the caregiver’sconsent. The pediatric neurologists conducted baselinephysical, developmental, and neurological assessments.
Caregivers were provided with information booklets and
charts to record seizure occurrence, number of emergencyroom (ER) visits for prolonged seizures in the ﬁrst 3 months
of rectal administration of IVD and then another 3 months
of rectal diazepam solution, and any adverse effects. Thecaregivers were asked to telephone the study staff at any
situation in which they needed assistance.
IVD (10 mg/2 mL/Amp) was manufactured by Li Ta
Pharma Co, Ltd., Taichung, Taiwan Rectal diazepam solutionwas manufactured by Alpharma, Inc., Lierskogen, Norway[Stesolid rectal tube (SRT)] as a soft, plastic yellow tube for
rectal administration, containing 2.5 mL of active ingredientof diazepam in a solution of 4-mg/mL (10 mg/rectal tube)
strength. Caregivers were trained to administer IVD and SRT
(dosage varying from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg of body weight)appropriately and to monitor respiration condition, seizure
severity, and adverse effects of drugs. If a seizure did not
cease within 10 minutes after administration of the ﬁrst dose,another one would be administered subsequently. If it did not
stop within another 10 minutes, the patient was required to be
brought to our ER to receive further management.
Our nursing specialist telephoned caregivers weekly
throughout the whole period of 6 months to provide
support; assess compliance with medication; conﬁrm and
bring up-to-date information on the child’s seizure charts;and assess the child’s clinical progress, including possible
adverse effects of medication. Our pediatric neurologists
also telephoned each caregiver, every 8 weeks, to reinforcethe study procedures, inquire about any unreported
seizures, and conﬁrm medication use. There were three
speciﬁed reasons for terminating a child’s participation inthe study: signiﬁcant increase of seizure frequency;development of possible side effects of medication that
caused concern (such as a rash or lethargy); or any kind of
worry expressed by caregivers.
2.1. Statistical analysis
Clinical factors obtained from family were analyzed as thedifference between rectal administrations of IVD and SRT tostop seizures. These factors included seizure control with
one dose, seizure control with two doses, patient numbers
with adverse effects, and number of ER visits for seizurecontrol. The association between each of these variables and
seizure control was examined. Statistical analysis was per-
formed with c
2test for categorical variables using SPSS (12.0)
statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A pvalue
less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
There were 9 male and 15 female patients enrolled in thestudy without any patient withdrawal from the study. Theirages ranged from 2 to 18 years, with a mean of 9.1 years.Seizure type was generalized tonic and/or clonic with orRectal diazepam for seizures 31without cyanosis. Twenty-one (87.5%) of them had mental
retardation and/or developmental delay.
In the 24 subjects enrolled in the study ( Table 1 ), 103 of
the 127 (81.1%) IVD administrations and 90 of the 103
(87.3%) SRT administrations resulted in cessation of seizure
within 10 minutes, and 24 IVD and 13 SRT administrationsthat failed to stop seizure within 10 minutes needed
a subsequent dose. The second IVD dose achieved cessation
of seizure in 21 of the remaining 24 episodes of seizureswithin another 10 minutes, and the second SRT dose
achieved cessation of seizure in 12 of the remaining 13
episodes within another 10 minutes. Four episodes (3 withrectal IVD and 1 with SRT) of prolonged seizure beyond 20
minutes received IVD injection at our ER. Sedation occurred
in 17% of patients, attributed to IVD in 8% and SRT in 9%.No respiratory depression was attributable to IVD or SRT. Noother serious adverse events occurred in the 6 months of
study period. No signiﬁcant statistical difference could be
found between these two treatments.
4. Discussion
Because rectal absorption occurs by passive diffusionthrough the lipoidal membrane, the optimal medicationshould be both lipid soluble and nonionized.
7Factors that
inﬂuence absorption include particle size, surface proper-ties, solubility, and ﬂuid content in the rectum. In general,suppositories are characterized by delayed and more vari-
able absorption than rectal solutions, which get into
contact with a greater surface area of the colon and rectalmucosa. Because the lower portion of the rectum is drained
by the middle and inferior rectal veins, which bypass the
portal circulation, absorbed medications avoid ﬁrst-passelimination in the liver and enter directly into the systemiccirculation.
8In children, the usual dose of rectal diazepam
has been 0.5 mg/kg. A clinical response was obtained in 72%of adults treated with 30 mg of rectal diazepam, witha mean time to cessation of seizure being 11.2 minutes.
9
Because the diazepam is highly lipophilic, it readilycrosses the blood ebrain barrier. Electroencephalographic
changes are induced as early as 1 e10 minutes after either
intravenous or rectal administration.
10,11The antiepileptic
effect may be related more to rapid brain penetration bydiazepam than to its serum concentration.
12,13
The management of acute seizure demands administra-
tion of appropriate medications, especially when theseizure is prolonged and status epilepticus is impending.Characteristics of the ideal medication include, (1) rapidonset of action, (2) wide spectrum of activity, (3) minimalredistribution, (4) short elimination half-life, (5) widetherapeutic margin of safety, and (6) easy administration.In general, diazepam has been considered to be the anti-
epileptic of choice for treating status epilepticus and
cluster seizures. However, intramuscular diazepam maycause necrosis at the site of injection, and absorption after
oral and intramuscular administration is slow and variable.
Conversely, rectal diazepam is rapidly absorbed. Peakserum concentrations may be obtained within 6 minutes.
14
Absorption varies with the formulation used and is slowerwith suppositories than with solutions.
15
Since its ﬁrst use in 1975,16rectally administered
parenteral diazepam solution has been an excellent alter-native when emergency therapy is needed and intravenousaccess is not available. However, it is inconvenient andtime consuming to cut the ampoule, draw the diazepam
solution into the gauge, insert a lubricated rectal tube, and
push it into the rectum. In the United States, a diazepamrectal gel has been shown to be effective and less time
consuming.
6,17e19The diazepam in solution form is better
for rectal absorption than that in gel form.20
Rectal diazepam is effective both in aborting seizures
and in preventing febrile seizures. Knudsen21reported that
rectal diazepam stopped seizures in 96% of patients if given
within 15 minutes after seizure onset. If given later in thecourse of the seizure, it was effective in only 57% of
patients. When given prophylactically at the time of fever,
rectal diazepam was as effective as daily phenobarbital inpreventing febrile seizures.
22,23
Caregivers can be taught to use rectal diazepam at
home.24e27Kriel et al25reported that 85% of 67 families
reported the effectiveness of rectal diazepam in controlling
their children’s seizures. Adverse effects were reported by
45% and usually consisted of drowsiness or behavioralchanges.
27Respiratory difﬁculties were experienced by ﬁve
patients, although it was impossible to determine whetherthey were caused by the medication or the seizures.
27
When used as recommended, diazepam rectal gel hasa low rate of serious morbidity or mortality.
27Our patients
did not have serious adverse effects. Local irritation afterrectal administration of diazepam has been reportedbefore,
28but it did not occur in our study.
Rectal emergency medication may elicit social fear, and it
may elicit increased expectations of bullying if recurring.29
We did not face similar situations because most of our
enrollees had mental retardation and/or developmental
delay. SRT could decrease the care burden for those specialkids with epilepsy no matter whether they stayed at home or

were prescribed diazepam rectal gel did not encounterresistance to its use in school and day care settings.

too.32
In conclusion, rectal diazepam solution, administered at
home by trained caregivers, is as effective and safe asrectal administration of the parenteral form of diazepam
for children with intractable epilepsy.
