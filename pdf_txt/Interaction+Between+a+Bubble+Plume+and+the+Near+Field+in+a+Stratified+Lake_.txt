 ABSTRACT  
This dissertation presents laboratory experiments  of bubble plumes in cross flows  
and field measurements i n managed lakes aerated by bubble plumes  to better understand 
the behavior of bubble plumes in natural environments . The laboratory  experiments were 
conducted to invest igate the detailed time -average  and turbulent fluctuating velocity 
field in the wake region behind the bubble column  and above the separation height, at 
which fluid entrained  at the base  of the plume  separates from the bubbles. These 
measurements are important for developing  predictive models for bubb le plume 
dynamics and for quantifying  their mixing characteristics. Two field campaigns, at 
Carvins Cove in Virginia and at Lake Hallwil in Switzerland , were conducted  to 
measure the detailed bottom boundary currents and oxygen exchange across the 
sediment -water interface for different diffuser operations. These  lakes have different 
bubble plume diffuser types, and they span a range of shape, bathymetry, and 
environmental forcing. These field data are useful to elucidate the physical mechanisms 
by which cur rents resulting from both natural forcing (e.g., seiches) and artificial forcing 
(e.g., bubble plumes) affect oxygen uptake at the sediment -water interface, with the 
ultimate goal of better management of aeration systems in drinking water reservoirs.   
 Experimental techniques applied  in the laboratory experiments include Particle 
Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence ( PLIF). Crossflows 
were generated in two ways: by towing the source and by forcing  a recirculation current. 
A combi nation of field equipment was used in the field campaigns , including a 
microprofiler  for temperature and oxygen ; point and profiling acoustic Doppler  
iii 
 velocimeter (ADV);  thermistor chains ; conductivity, temper ature, and depth (CTD) 
profiles;  and a meteorolo gical station. During the field experiments, the bubble plume 
flow rate was varied to produce different dynamic and chemical conditions in the lakes.  
The l aboratory experiments  present a cohesive view of the flow dynamics in the 
wake of a bubble plume in crossflow. Using the forced and towed plume validates the 
analogy of the towed plume to that of the real current. The o bservations showed that no 
secondary bubble plume form s above the separation height , but rather the bubble column 
becomes a continuous source of vertical momentum to the wake region . The resulting 
vertical velocities impart a rising frame of r eference on the separated plume  so that its 
trajectory scales like a bu oyant jet despite the absence of buoyancy in the separated 
fluid. Maximum values of the Reynolds stresses and mixing occur at the base of the 
separated plumes, and the bubble column elevates both the turbulence intensity and the 
kinetic energy throughout t he wake region.  
The in situ  field measurements provide insight into the role of aeration bubble 
plumes on the oxygen dynamics at the sediment -water interface. Detailed, simultaneous 
measurements of turbulence and oxygen uptake in the bottom boundary layer  allowed 
the direct validation of boundary exchang e models . The measurements also showed that 
unsteady operation of the bubble plume results in generation of basin -scale internal 
waves that drive measurable curren ts in the bottom boundary layer . Moreover , 
measurements showed that it is the oxygen concentration outside the diffusive boundary 
layers that is the dominant mechanism for control ling the uptake at the sediment -water 
interface.

  1. INTRODUCTION   
Multiphase flows are ubiquitous in natural and man -made environments and have 
been the focus of significant resear ch in fluid dynamics. In recent years, scientists and 
engineers have explored new topics in multiphase flows due to their relevance in 
important areas such as global warming, water quality control, and analysis, mitigation, 
and risk assessment of oil well blowouts. Ocean carbon sequestration, i.e. release of CO2 
in the form of multiphase plumes in the deep ocean, has been considered as one 
approach to mitigate rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, an important forcing 
for the global climate system.  M ultiphase plumes are increasingly used in the form of 
bubble plumes for mixing or aeration in lakes to improve water quality by addition of 
oxygen, also, with the trend toward deepwater oil and gas exploration and production, 
there is heightened risk for t he oil -well blowouts, which generate multiphase plumes of 
oil and gas.  A key feature of the multiphase plumes in these examples is their ability to 
mix and transport the surrounding water.  For CO2 sequestration and lake management, 
the induced mixing and  transport are integral to the performance of the engineered 
systems; thus, the efficiency and performance of each design would benefit from better 
understanding of bubble plume behavior in the enclosing environment. For oil -well 
blowouts, mixing and trans port determine the locations and toxicity of the impact; 
hence, mitigation and risk assessment benefit from better understanding of mixing 
processes in multiphase plumes.    
Environmental conditions, including ambient currents, are very influential in 
deter mining the behavior of multiphase plumes in their applications. In the presence of  
2 
 an ambient current, a multiphase plume will be deflected downstream. As the current 
becomes stronger, it starts to strip the entrained continuous phase fluid away from the 
dispersed bubbles, drops, or particles, thus, reducing upward flux of entrained water. 
Eventually, when the crossflow becomes strong enough, the plume may reach an 
equilibrium condition where inflow through the plume leading edge is matched to 
outflow in th e downstream wake. In this condition, the upward velocity of entrained 
fluid is minimized. In spite of the important influence that crossflow can have on the 
behavior of multiphase plumes, there are comparatively few studies devoted to 
multiphase plumes in  the presence of currents, and very few quantitative data for 
velocity fields through multiphase plumes in crossflow. To optimize the application of 
multiphase plumes in environmental systems where currents are ubiquitous, it is 
important to improve the kn owledge of the behavior and performance of the multiphase 
plumes in moving environments. For this purpose, this dissertation applies both 
laboratory and field experiment methods to study bubble plumes, a particular case of a 
multiphase plume, in realistic ambient conditions. This study particularly focuses on the 
understanding of physical mixing and transport processes in air -aerated bubble plumes in 
crossflows and the influence of bubble plume operation on the overall flow 
characteristics in closed basins.    
1. 1. Motivation of study  
Depletion of oxygen in the hypolimnia of lakes and reservoirs is a pernicious 
global problem which negatively affects the drinking -water treatment process, cold -
water fisheries, and riverine flow impacted by releases from hydropower reservoirs.  
3 
 Mitigation of low level oxygen levels is increasingly accomplished using hypolimnetic 
oxygenation via bubble plumes. While properly designed bubble plumes are successful 
at adding oxygen, recent studies have shown that uptake of oxygen across the sediment -
water inter face is correlated with the diffuser gas flow rate. This may be caused by larger 
concentration gradients across the sediment -water interface, mixing induced by currents 
generated by the bubble plume, or a combination of these processes. Yet, no definitive 
data exist to determine a mechanism, and existing coupled 3 -D hydrodynamic lake 
models do not account for the currents induced by the bubble plumes. To bridge this gap, 
this dissertation aims to elucidate the flow field induced by a bubble plume in crossfl ow 
and to study the current field in the benthic boundary layer of two oxygenated. The tools 
developed in these studies will allow lake managers to efficiently design artificial bubble 
plumes for maximum input of oxygen. Moreover, the bubble plume models a re also 
generally useful for modeling a wide array of multiphase plume applications, including 
CO2 sequestration and oil well blowouts.  
1. 2. Bubble plumes in a crossflow  
Bubbles released from a localized source rise through the water column and 
entrain ambient water. This upward rising mixture, driven by the buoyancy of the 
bubbles, constitutes a plume. Crossflows alter the plume dynamics by causing the plume 
to deflect in the downstream direction. Because the bubbles slip relative to the water, in 
strong crossf low the bubbles may separate from the water on the leading edge of the 
plume  (Socolofsky and Adams, 2002a)  . Figure 1 shows a laboratory bubble plume in a 
crossflow. The image is an instantaneous sample from laboratory experiments of bubble  
4 
 plumes in crossflow us ing the Planar Laser Induce d Fluorescence ( PLIF) technique to 
visualize  the plume center  plane.  In these experiments, the fluorescent  dye was injected 
at the source to track the path traced out by the entrained ambient fluid. The velocity 
streamlines are  also shown  in the figure  on top of the PLIF image. Streamlines are 
computed using the Particle Image Velocimetry  (PIV)  technique, by which velocities are 
quantified throughout the flow  on the same two -dimensional center plane .  As seen in 
Figure 1, close to the source, the entrained fluid rises with the bubbles forming a plume . 
Prior to the onset of separation, modeling of the bubble plume can be simplified by 
treating the mixture as a mixed single -phase plume with 
b B gQÔÅ≤
ÔÅ≤ÔÅÑÔÄΩ  as its initial 
buoyancy flux , where 
ÔÅ≤ = ambient density, 
ÔÅ≤ÔÅÑ = density difference at the source, g = 
acceleration due to gravity, and Qb = the volume flux of air at the source . After reaching 
the separation height, entrained fluid separates from the bubbles. Thereafter, air bubble 
trajectory can be predicted from the sum of the slip velocity and ambient current 
velocity. Socolofsky and Adams  (2002)  derived e mpirical correlations for the separation 
height  (hs) from simila r laboratory experiments and found  
2.4 0.885.1 ( )ssh B u uÔÇ•ÔÄΩ where 
ùë¢‚àû = ambient velocity and the ùë¢ùë†  = bubble slip velocity . Here,  the empirical constant 
5.1 is dimensionless and is determined from the experiments.

1.2.1 Knowledge gaps  
The wake region above the separated entrained plume is shown in Figure 1 in the 
outlined dashed triangle . There are scarce measurements in this region and little is 
known about the properties of flow in this region. Consequently, there are a few issues 
that are still unclear and can be resolved using the measurements in this region. For 
example, it is of int erest to determine whether  a secondary bubble plume would form 
above  the separation  height . Additionally, the dynamics of the wake behind the bubble 
column is of significant importance especially for applications such as aeration  and 
bubble plume mixing . To answer these questions and understand  this region  in detail , 
measureme nts of the velocity field in this  wake region are needed  for bubble plumes in 
crossflow . At the same time, the average d and instantaneous measurement  database  
6 
 collected in these experi ments forms a valuable and consistent dataset for the validation 
and development of advanced three -dimensional two -phase flow simulation tools.  
1.2.2 Scaling analysis for bubble plume  
To design the experiments and to relate the results to field scale, it is important to 
define the fundamental scaling parameters of a bubble plume in crossflow.  
Scaling laws for bubble plumes have been reported by many studies (Asaeda and 
Imberger, 1993; Mcdougall, 1978; Milgram, 1983; Socolofsky and Adams, 2002a, 
2005) . Socolofsky and Adams (2002)  extended the work of  Wright, (1984)  who 
analyzed th e general case of a single -phase buoyant jet in a stratified crossflow . They 
defined the governing dimensional parameters for a bubble plume in crossflow by 
making some simplifications which l ed to the following parameters: the crossflow 
velocity ùë¢‚àû, the slip velocity us (which is the terminal rise velocity of a bubble in a 
stagnant reservoir that includes the dynamic effect of several bubble properties), the 
height above the discharge, and the buoyancy flux (B). Thus, in functional form, any  
properties  of bubble plume in crossflow can be written as
( , , , )s f B u u zÔÅ¶ÔÇ•ÔÄΩ . Correlation 
equations in   (Socolofsky and Adams, 2002b)  for the case of crossflow provide the 
relationship for hs as previously defined in this section.  
(Bombardelli et al., 2007)  established a characteristic length scale in  an 
unstratified, quiescent bubble plume , given as 
234sBDuÔÅ∞ÔÅ°ÔÄΩ  (where Œ± is the entrainment 
coefficient) . They  showed that the plume properties become asymptotic (i.e. independent 
of initial conditions) when z/D > 5. The existence of this length scale  explains why the  
7 
 bubble plume is not really self-similar, since self-similarity is only possible if there is 
only one geometric length scale in the problem  (e.g., z) . Since D is an additional  
geometric length scale, self -similarity  breaks down for the bubble plumes. This break 
down in self -similarity is weak, however, so that results from integral models remain 
valuab le. 
In stratification, another length scale emerges, which is related to the trapping 
height of the stratification, given by

ÔÄ®ÔÄ©ÔÄ®ÔÄ© []N g zÔÅ≤ÔÅ≤ÔÄΩ ÔÄ≠ ÔÇ∂ ÔÇ∂  is the 
buoyancy frequency of the stratification. Entrainment of stratifi ed water results in 
negative buoyancy for the plume fluid. If the negative buoyancy overcomes the positive 
buoyancy of the bubbles, the water will separate, or peel, forming an intrusion layer at a 
trap height hT, given from experiment by

where

NsU u BNÔÄΩ  is the non -dimensional slip velocity  (Socolofsky and Adams, 
2005) . 
For bubble plumes in crossflow, stratification can be ignored if hs << hT, that is, 
separation is caused by the crossflow before it would be i nitiated by the stratification  
(Socolofsky and Adams, 2002b) . This dissertation will focus on the crossflow dominant 
case.  
In this case where stratification is negligible, three dominant length scales are:  
ÔÇ∑ Water depth, H which is a limiting parameter  on the heigh t of the plume .  
8 
 ÔÇ∑ Characteristic length scale  D of an unstratified bubble plume.  
The non -dimensional ratios of these parameters, i.e,

define the scaling laws needed to relate laboratory experiments to the field (provided 
hs<<hT); they also help to define the relevant parameter space covered by a set of 
experiments.  
1. 3. Lake aeration management  
A large number of lakes and reservoirs around the world are increasingly 
managed by bubble plumes to artificially add oxygen to the lake bottom water.  
Excessive loadings of phosphorous increase the content of organic matter, which leads to 
increase in oxygen demand upon decomposition of the organic ma tter at the sediments. 
Meanwhile, stable stratification conditions, particularly in summer months, inhibit the 
replenishment of oxygen to bottom water by surface aeration. As a result, lower layers 
exhibit significantly reduced water quality due to low oxy gen concentration while 
oxygen is needed to sustain a healthy lake ecosystem and to reduce costs for water 
treatment in drinking water supplies (Little and McGinnis, 2001) . A considerable 
amount of literature has been published on the consequences of oxygen depletion in 
lakes and reservoirs  (Beutel et al., 2008; Cooke and Carlson, 1989; Paul A. Gantzer et 
al., 2009; Huttunen et al., 2006; Stefan, 1992) . 
Engineered bu bble plumes in lakes have been studied in detail in the literature  
(Hugi, 1993; Mcdougall, 1978; W√ºest et al., 1992) . Integral models for bubble plumes in 
stratified reservoirs have been developed (Asaeda and Imberger, 1993; W√ºest et al.,  
9 
 1992)  and validated to field data in quiescent stratification (Lemckert and Imberger, 
1993; Singleton et al., 2007; W√ºest et al., 1992) . Although bubble plumes can be 
designed to perform their role by adding oxygen successfully, studies have shown that 
they may increase the consumption of oxygen at the sediments. Whether this increased 
O2 uptake is due to the higher concentration of O2  in the hypolimnion or increased 
mixing resulting from currents generated by the bubble plume is unclear.  
1.3.1 Knowledge  gap 
Despi te the current broad application of bubble plumes in lakes , little is known 
about if /how turbulence changes caused by bubble plume operations affect Oxygen 
Uptake at the sediment -water interface  in the field ( JO2), where JO2 can be significantly 
affected by natural turbulence as well.  Furthermore, it is of great importance to know 
how the uptake can be predicted from the bottom turbulence and oxygen concentration 
profiles. It would be beneficial for the numerical models and f or designing bubble plume 
diffusers to more accurately predict the induced sediment oxygen uptake. The current 
best practice is the use of an induced hypolimnetic oxygen uptake multiplier as a factor 
of safety  (Beutel, 2003; Moore et al., 1996) . To answer these questions field 
measurements in two lakes aerated by bubble plumes were conducted to measure JO2 and 
the benthic boundary layer flow dynamics under different environmental conditions and 
bubble plume operations. Together with the laboratory experiments, these observations 
provide a holistic view of bubble plume dynamics in natural conditions and th eir 
potential effects in closed basins.

This dissertation is a compilation of three manuscripts  which have been prepared  
for publication , each  included as separate sections  followed by the summary of results 
for further research and appendices that give the details of the experimental methods and 
selected results.  
A preview of the content of each section  is provided below:  
Section  2- In this section , the average d properties of the flow on the center -plane 
of a bubble plume is  quantified  in the laboratory using PLIF and PIV . Also, through two 
sets of independent experiments the analogy of a towed plume to a bubble plume in a 
real cross flow  is validated . Using these observation s, we quantify the trajectory of the 
separated continuous phase, provide data for validation of numerical simulations, gain a 
better understanding of flow behavior at the wake and propose a conceptual model to 
predict the vertical velocity of th e ambient water flowing through the bubble column 
above the separation height . 
Section  3 - The overarching goa l of this section is to present  the analysis of

downstream of a round bubble plume in moving ambient, using high -speed velocity field 
data. Profiles of turbulence intensities and Reynolds stresses are presented for this kind 
of flow for the first time and the effects of bubbles on turbulence generation are 
investigated . 
Section  4- The ultimate goal of this section is to study the effects of bubble 
plume operation on near-sediment mixing and oxygen uptake in real lakes and to use  
11 
 these field observations to develop a physics -based predictive model for the flux of 
oxygen across the sediment -water interface as a result of mixing induced by natural and 
artificial currents , as from a bubble plume for lake aeration.  
Each manuscript is intended to stand alone and have its own conclusion. Even 
though each section  has its own lis t of references, these were omitted in the individual

 2. EXPERIMENTS ON PHYSI CS OF BUBBLE PLUMES IN CROSSFLOW  
2. 1. Overview  
This paper presents detailed laboratory experiments of a round bubble  plume in 
uniform crossflows. Standard Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique was utilized 
to obtain the velocity field of the continuous phase in the plume center plane. The PIV 
data were obtained from twenty -five separate camera fields of views used to map the 
whole velocity field over a 65.5cm √ó 68.5cm region. The analogy of a towed plume to 
that of a real current was also examined by comparing the results from two independent 
experiments (i.e., using a towed source and recirculating flume). Analysis  of the time -
averaged velocity field shows that: the trajectory of the separated continuous phase fluid 
in the wake behind the bubble column deviates from the asymptotic power laws for 
momentum jet and instead matches plume scaling laws due to the vertical  momentum 
imparted by the bubbles on fluid flowing through the bubble column above the 
separation height. A conceptual model is proposed to predict the vertical velocities of the 
ambient water above the separation point which agrees well with the measured 
velocities.  
2. 2. Introduction  
Natural and engineered bubble plumes often occur in flowing environments. 
Such applications include lake aeration (W√ºest et al., 1992)  , reservoir desertification 
(Lemckert and Imberger, 1993) , reducing salt intrusion (Uittenbogaard et al., 2015) , and 
accidental subsea oil -well bl owouts (Mcdougall, 1978) . Socolofs ky and Adams (2002)   
13 
 showed that fluid entrained in the base of a bubble plume in crossflow may be lifted to 
varying elevations depending on the plume configuration, and then separates itself from 
the plume. This leads to the idea that the existence of c rossflow has the potential to have 
a positive or negative impact on the objective functionality of the bubble plume 
depending on the design purpose. For example, for reservoir destratification purposes, it 
is important to know whether the bubble plume is c apable of lifting the bottom water 
into the epilimnion and eroding the thermocline. Also, the impact of crossflow on the 
design goal was an important question for the destratification of Notterdom waterways, 
in which, the possibility of using bubble plumes  instead of hard structures was 
considered for the purpose of preventing the intrusion of the seawater into the fresh 
water intakes of the irrigation systems. Likewise, in aeration systems, crossflow can 
impact the contact time between the water and the ga s. This will control the 
concentration of the dissolved gas and distribution of the injected gas into the 
hypolimnion of the lake. For oil -well blowouts, designing better mitigation technologies 
and making better decisions during future disasters require b etter understanding of the 
transport of released oil and gas under ambient currents during the blowout. This paper, 
in particular, addresses these concerns by investigating the flow field downstream of a 
round bubble plume in a moving ambient fluid. An imp roved understanding of the 
behavior of bubble plumes in ambient currents will lead to more accurate predictions of 
the environmental impacts of underwater oil and gas blowouts and more efficient design 
of aeration and destratification systems.   
14 
 Most previou s experimental studies focus on bubble plumes in virtually stagnant 
water (Bryant et al., 2009a; D. -G. Seol et al., 2007) , and very limited laboratory 
experiments were conducted in crossflows. The general problem of single -phase jets/ or 
plumes in a crossflow has been studied extensively in the past; e.g. Fan (1967)  and Lee 
and Chu (2003) , and experiments of single and multiphase plumes in crossflow have 
observed some similar traits. In their studies of vertical buoyant jets discharged into a 
perpendicular crossflow, Davi dson and Pun (1999)  and Pun and Davidson (1999)  
observed tracer detachment from the main body of the jet that leads to an elongated 
lower jet edge. They showed the detachment of tracer happ ens whenever the ambient -to-
entrainment velocity ratio becomes high enough. Hugi (1993)  and (Socolofsky and 
Adams, 2002b)  observed a similar behavior for bubble plumes in crossflows. This can be 
explained by the fact that in bubble plumes, bubbles are not required to follow the fluid 
and instead slip; as a result, crossflow can pull and s eparate the entrained fluid from the 
rising bubbles. Consequently, when the entrainment velocity becomes weaker than the 
crossflow, the crossflow pulls the fluid out of the plume, i.e. exhausting it of its 
entrained water. Above this critical point in the plume, the bubble column behavior 
resembles more that of a porous column than a plume. (Socolofsky and Adams, 2002b)  
quantified the characteristic separation height as the height where the fluid entrained at 
the base of the plume separates from the dispersed phase. They provided an empirical 
equation that relates the separation height ‚Ñéùë† to the bubble buoyancy flux 
b B gQÔÅ≤
ÔÅ≤ÔÅÑÔÄΩ  
(where
ÔÅ≤ = ambient density, 
ÔÅ≤ÔÅÑ = density difference at the source, g = acceleration due  
15 
 to gravity, and Qb = the volume flux of air at the source), ambient crossflow velocity u‚àû 
and the bubble slip velocity  us  as 
‚Ñéùë†=5.1ùêµ
(ùë¢‚àûùë¢ùë†2.4)0.88       ( 2 ) 
where the empirical constant 5.1 is dimensionless and  determined from the experiments. 
Based on the defined separation height, they categorized the crossflow into weak and 
strong. In a weak crossflow, entrainment keeps the plume fluid with the bubbles 
throughout the reservoir depth; whereas, in a strong cros sflow, the plume fluid entrained 
at the source will separate from the bubbles at the separation height, below the free 
surface. Figure 2 shows the problem of the bubble plume as presented by Socolofsky and 
Adams (2002) . Also, separated entrained plume in the downstream wake and the wake 
region above the separation heig ht is shown on this figure. Tracking fluid entrained at 
the source, as was done by Socolofsky and Adams (2002)  , is of practical importance in 
applications such as oil well blowouts where small oil droplets may be expected to 
follow the entrained flu id. In other applications such as lake aerations or CO 2 
sequestration, the pathways of water entering the plume at all heights are of interest to 
predict the concentration of dissolved gas downstream of the bubble plume.  
Available quantified data in bubble  plumes in crossflows are very limited with 
scarce velocity information for much of the flow field. Hugi (1993)  performed 
experiments of bubble plumes in crossflows using the towed approach and presented 
coarse data on the velocity field in the wake.  Zhang and Zhu (2013)  did an experimental 
study on characteristics of bubbly jets in crossflow. The jets were generated by releasing 
water together with air from a nozzl e in their study, they focus on the bubble properties  
16 
 and did not obtain velocity measurements of the continuous phase.  They also released 
dye streaks windward of the bubbly jets to track the movement of the ambient water 
passing the bubbly jets and they qualitatively observed that bubble induced water 
velocity inside the bubble plume is significant for the bubbly jets with small and no 
water flow rate. However, these studies did not measure the velocity field in the wake 
and consequently, there are no qua ntified velocity measurements over the downstream 
wake especially above the separation height which is needed to better understand the 
mixing and validate numerical models in this region of the flow.  
 
Figure 2. Bubble plume in a c rossflow, adapted from Socolofsky and Adams (2002)  
Numerical methods of bubble plume analysis span the range from one -
dimensional integral models to fully three -dimensional computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD) models. Integral models have been used to predict the bubble plume‚Äôs properties 
in the stagnant ambient conditions (Crounse et al., 2007; Mcdougall, 1978; Socolofsky et 
al., 2008) . These models are based on the self -similarity and entrainment hypotheses. 
Nonetheless, in crossflow, bubbles are not required to trav el with the entrained ambient 
 
17 
 water, and entrained fluid in the plume core may continually be refreshed by the 
currents, which violates the self -similarity assumption of the integral model approach. 
For the case of crossflows, Socolofsky and Adams (20 02) showed that prior to 
separation, the two -phase plume can be modeled as a mixed single -phase plume with B 
as its initial buoyancy flux. As hs is reached, all entrained water from the source is 
observed to be detrained into the wake of the plume becomes a single -phase momentum 
jet. The trajectory of this separated continuous phase can be predicted with its 
momentum flux derived from the local ent rained fluid velocity and width at the 
separation height. The trajectory of the dispersed bubble column can be predicted from 
the sum of the slip velocity and ambient current velocity. Thus, the integral model as 
described can track the trajectory of the f luid which is entrained at the source of the 
plume but does not consider the fluid passing through the plume into the wake in the 
leeward side of the plume or the bubble plume induced flow field above hs. A few other 
integral models have been developed bas ed on these observations to predict accidental 
oil-well blowouts in the presence of crossflows (Johansen, 2000; Yapa et al., 1999; Yapa 
and Chen, 2004; Yapa and Li, 1997; Zheng et al., 2003) . These studies have used limited 
field and laboratory data as related experimental data are very rare (Chen and Yapa, 
2004) . These models include the effects of cross currents and separation of continuous 
phase from the dispersed phase. They track the continuous phase of th e plume after the 
separation of the dispersed phase and track the separated dispersed phase using 
lagrangian particle tracking models. However, none of these models consider the effects 
of the wake formed due to the plume or the dynamic effect of the separ ated dispersed  
18 
 phases. Therefore, there is a need for data to validate these numerical techniques, to 
predict the crossflow -plume interaction, and to further investigate the wake region flow 
where models have not been validated . 
To address this existing re search gap, this paper uses laboratory experimental 
data to study the behavior of the bubble plumes in crossflow to quantify the time -
averaged velocity field throughout the bubble plume and its downstream wake in a 
forced current us ing PIV . In a separate s et of experiments, a towed source has been used 
with dye visualization (similar to Socolofsky and Adams (2002) ). To determine whether 
a towed bubble plume is representative of a bubble plume in a real crossflow (e.g., 
forced current) and also to chec k that the presence of flume turbulence did not bias the 
results, streamlines from the PIV measurements in the open -channel were compared 
with PLIF results for a towed plume. Using these comprehensive experimental 
measurements, the flow field has been thor oughly quantified on the center plane of the 
plume (i.e., below the separation height, above the separation height and also at the 
separated continuous phase).  
Sections 2.3 and 2.4 present the experimental methods and data analysis. Section 
5 reports the o bservations and discussions, which includes the detailed measurement 
results of the plume and its downstream wake, comparison between a towed plume and 
crossflow, contrasting the trajectory of the separated continuous phase with asymptotic 
scaling laws for  jets and plumes, and introduces a conceptual model to predict the 
vertical velocities above the separation height. Finally, the main conclusions are 
summarized in section 5.   
19 
 2. 3. Experimental methods  
The experiments were carried out in a glass -walled flume 35 m long by 0.9 m 
wide and 1.2 m deep in the Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the Zachry Department of 
Civil Engineering at Texas A&M University. The tank is equipped with both a towing 
carriage, to simulate crossflow by moving the plume source, and a recirculat ion pump 
system, which was used to simulate different ambient currents (generating a forced 
current). Hence, crossflow was created in two different, yet comparable, ways, and 
independent sets of experiments were conducted for open channel crossflow and tow ed 
source along the long axis of the flume with the plume placed in the center axis of the 
flume. The measurement approach for each set of experiment is described in the 
following.  
To generate the bubble plume, we used a 2.5 cm tall by 1.4 cm in diameter 
porous aquarium airstone, which was located at the centerline of the wave flume at a 
depth of 0.68 m. The bubble flow  rates were chosen as Qo = 0.5, 1 and 1.5 NL/min to 
match those of previous experiments with zero crossflow (D. Seol et al., 2007) .  The 
bubble flow  rates at standard pressure and temperature were monitored by a calibrated 
gas flowmeter. As reported in Lai and Socolofsky (2015), who used a similar setup, the 
generated air bubbles have a median diameter d50 of 2.4 mm ( Figure 3) with a 
corresponding velocity of 24 cm/s (Clift et al., 2005a) . The bubble size was visually 
validated from the raw images in the crossflow experiments.   
20 
  
Figure 3. Bubble size distribu tion adopted from Lai and Socolofsky (2015)  
Three different ambient currents of u ‚àû=4, 10, and 15 cm/s were simulated in 
open channel crossflow and u ‚àû=4, 10, and 14.5 cm/s in the towed experiments. 
Combined with the water depth and the bubble flow rates, th ese crossflows span a range 
of separation heights (i.e., no separation, weak separation, and strong separation). Table

For the towed experiments, the crossflow was simulated using the overhead tow 
carriage. The diffuser was mounted to the carriage by an L -shaped PVC support in a way 
that the diffuser could be supported at the tank centerline and disturbance of the flow in 
the tank was minimized. The tow carriage was equipped with a variable speed motor 
yielding speeds of 4 to 14.5 cm/s.   
For open channel flow, crossflows were generated using two centrifugal pumps 
equipped with a frequency controller. The pumps are capable of generating flows 
ranging between 1.32 and 6.06 m3/s. The flow rates were monitored by the inline 
propeller flow meter in the external recirculation piping as well as by ADV velocity 
measurements in the flume  during the experiments. Recirculating flow enters the flume 
through a ramp inlet in the flume bottom creating a submerged wall jet. In order to 
destroy the jet structure of the inflow at the flume entrance, an array of bricks was placed 
immediately after the inflow (Ghisalberti and Nepf, 2002) . A homogeneous grid of

 porous plates was then used to smooth the velocity profile as suggested by Stoker 
(1946) . Flow straighteners made out of PVC pipes wit h a diameter of 2.54cm and length 
of 70cm were used to eliminate large scale turbulence and secondary currents. The 
bubble plume was located at 19 times the water depth downstream of the flow 
straightener, which was about 2/3 of the flume length. Measureme nts of the velocity 
field validated the uniform open channel flow condi tion in the measurement section.  
In all the experiments, the center plane of the bubble plume was illuminated by a 
laser sheet. The vertical illumination plane along the centerline of t he bubble diffuser 
was produced using continuous lasers along with a pair of cylindrical lenses that focused 
and expanded the beam, creating the light sheet. The light sheet was formed outside the 
tank and directed into the tank through the glass at the si de of the tank and oriented 
upward by a mirror placed on the bottom of the tank.  
For the towed bubble plume, visualization of the bulk flow field was 
accomplished by qualitative planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) using a continuous 
wave Nd: YAG laser , operating on a single wavelength of 532 nm and capable of peak 
power up to 5.3 W. This high power was needed to illuminate the large field of view 
spanning the full wake region in one camera field of view. Rhodamine 6G dye was used 
as the dye tracer and was injected as a continuous point source just upstream of the 
aquarium airstone, at the same depth as the diffuser. The dye flow rate was held constant 
using a Marriot bottle configuration. Following injection, the dye stream was rapidly 
entrained into th e front of the plume and tracked along the streamline of fluid entrained 
near the base of the plume. A schematic of the setup is shown in Figure 4. The dye was  
23 
 efficiently excited by the Nd: YAG laser and fluoresced at a peak emission near 550 nm. 
Images were captured using a progressive scan CCD camera (Basler acA1600 -20gm 
gigE interface camera). The video images were processed to quantify characterist ic 
scales of the plume evolution. These include the height of separation of the dyed fluid in 
the wake of the plume, the centerline trajectory of the dye streak, and the visual tracking 
of individual coherent structures in the dye plume.  
 
Figure 4. Schematic of the PLIF set up 
Quantitative measurements for the forced current case were accomplished using 
PIV, where the source of light sheet was a continuous Argon -ion laser (Spectra - Physics) 
capable of a peak power of 2.8 W. The flum e water was seeded with neutrally buoyant 
homopolymer polyamide particles (manufactured by Vestonic) with mean diameter of 
56 microns and of specific gravity 1.03. Flow images were captured by a high speed 
Phantom camera (Phantom v5.1, Vision Research Inc. ) mounted on a three -dimensional 
 
24 
 traverse and positioned perpendicularly to the light sheet. The camera frame rate was 
200Hz and the exposure time was 300 microseconds collecting 2000 images for each 
measurement burst (e.g., 10s burst duration, limited by camera physical memory). The 
resolution of the camera is 1024√ó1024 pixels at 10 bit gray scale resolution. In order to 
cover the whole field of interest, 25 fields of view (FOV) were used, starting from the 
center of the bubble diffuser. Each FOV is define d by two numbers; first number 
indicates the row number and the second number shows the number of column in our 
measurement matrix. Each FOV has the dimension of 15√ó15 cm with 1.5 cm overlap. 
Experiments were repeated three times at each FOV, which resulte d in a total of 30 
seconds of data, or 6015 images at each flow rate. The PIV processing of these images 
resulted in 30s of instantaneous velocity data (in 10s bursts), providing the full -field 
velocity along the plume center plane. Meanwhile, PIV sequence s were neither synoptic 
from FOV to FOV nor were the data contiguous over the whole 30 s at each 
measurement point; therefore, we rebuild the flow field from statistical averages of the 
results. Figure 5 shows a schematic of the experiment set up.

2. 4. Data analysis  
2.4.1.  Image preprocessing and PIV analysis  
Before applying the PIV algorithm to the images, the dispersed phase (i.e., 
bubbles) needs to be discriminated from the seeding particles in the FOVs that contain 
bubbles to obtain the continuous phase velocities. Previous studies suggested three 
approache d to remove the bubble signatures: Optical separation, removing bubble 
signature by pre -processing the images, and vector post -processing of the mixed -phase 
velocity field (Seol and Socolofsky, 2008a) . In this study we used the second method 
and removed the bubbles by pre -processing the images containing both phases, which 
resulted in images containing only particles to which PIV can be applied. A size and 
brightness discrimination method was used based on the method introduced by (Seol and 
Socolofsky, 2008a)  for separating the bubbles. The MATLAB image processing toolbox 
 
26 
 was used fo r identifying the bubbles based on their size and brightness; an appropriate 
mask was created for each image from the identified bubbles which could remove the 
dispersed phase from the image. This was accomplished as follows: Initially, 
background noise wa s removed by subtracting the mean of all the images. Secondly, the 
image was converted to a binary image containing all the pixels above a threshold 
intensity determined by trial and error. This way bubbles and tracer particles that were 
outside the laser sheet and illuminated from the reflected light were eliminated. Then the 
area-open algorithm was applied to the binary image to remove the contiguous objects 
below a threshold size to remove the tracer particles. To fill the possible hollow areas in 
the bu bbles, the area close algorithm was used to create filled bubbles. Finally, to make 
up for the fact that the bubble mask was from the binary image, the bubble mask was 
dilated to cover the area around the bubbles which fell below the threshold value. This 
new black and white mask of bubbles was multiplied by the original image to obtain an 
image with only bubbles, and was subtracted from the original image to obtain the 
particle image. This process takes trial and error to find the appropriate parameters. 
Figure 6 displays a raw image of a sample FOV containing bubbles (top), the bubble 
mask identified with image processing (middle), and the post processe d result after 
removing the bubbles (bottom).

28 
 Because of the removal of the bubbles,  the data coverage in the plume core is 
intermittent . This was circumvented partly by time averaging over the total experiment 
duration of 30 seconds , thereby obtaining the mean velocity  across the whole  plume 
core.  However, for high bubble concentrations,  some of the velocity statistics in the 
plume, did not converge. These regions are omitted from our analysis.  
The LaVision Davis software package was used to perform the PIV processing 
and obtain the velocity vector field. Velocities were calculated using a multiple pass 
interrogation window with 50% overlap. The iterations used an initial window size of 64 
by 64 pixels and a final interrogation window size of 32 by 32 pixels, yielding a uniform 
vector grid of 2.3 by 2.3 mm. To remove the vectors that did n ot accurately represent the 
flow field, a median filter was applied to the resulting velocity field by comparing each 
vector to the root mean square of the 8 surrounding vectors, and spurious vectors were 
replaced by a local neighbor average. A sample of t he resulting instantaneous velocity 
field for the particle image in Figure 6 is shown in Figure 7.

2.4.2.  PLIF analysis  
Video images from the PLIF experiments were processed to visualize the 
trajectory of the dye streak, separation of the dyed fluid in the wake of the plume, and 
the behavior of bubble plume for different cases. A sample image is shown in Figure 8. 
The images were rectified for geometric distortion based on the images of calibration 
grid plate to yield accurate geometric scaling.

rate 
In this study, a total of 9 experimental scenarios were investigated as presented in 
Table 1. Experiments are identified with two numbers: the first number indicates the 
current velocity and the second number shows the bubble flow rate. For example case 
0.04-0.5 is the case with the crossflow velocity of 0.04 m/s and bubbl e flow rate of 0.5 
NL/min.  
2. 5. Observations and discussions  
2.5.1.  Comparison of forced crossflow and towed plume  
Previous studies simulated crossflow using a towed bubble plume, where 
ambient water was not moving and ambient turbulence was neglected (Socolofsky and 
Adams, 2002b; Zhang and Zhu, 2014) . In this study, data from PLIF and PIV 
experiments were analyzed and compared to address three main questions. The first  
question is whether a towed source in stagnant water would accurately represent a fixed 
 
31 
 source in a crossflow and produce the same plume. The agreement between these results 
can validate the towed -plume analogy. The second question is whether the ambient 
turbulence in the forced crossflow has an impact on the results. Lastly, the third question 
addressed by this comparison is whether the vertical velocities measured in the PIV data 
are consistent with the upward motion of the dye in the PLIF experiments. T his question 
is raised since the wake field is three dimensional and the dye in the wake will spread 
throughout the full wake region, which may cause the mean advection of dye to not 
match the PIV measured velocity on the center plane. To address these que stions, the 
streamlines of the wake flow field  were computed directly from the time  averaged PIV 
data in the forced current experiment and then plotted  on top of the rectified  PLIF 
images from analogous experiments using a towed source. Figure 9 shows streamlines  
laid over PLIF images for different cases of the flow, including weak separation cases 
(such as u ‚àû= 0.04 m/s and Q 0 = 1 NL/min) and strong separation cases suc h as (u ‚àû= 0.15 
m/s and Q 0 = 1.5 NL/min).  The PLIF images  have been flipped right to left to match the 
direction of the PIV data and the grayscale has been inverted to improve  clarity  of the 
presentation .  
32 
  
Figure 9. Comparison of PLIF observations to PIV streamlines for different cases of bubble flow 
rates and current velocities  
As observed in Figure 9, the agreement between the trajectory of the dye from 
the PLIF experiments and the streamlines from the PIV experiments is quite similar for 
all the cases. Hence, the dye trajectory along the center plane of a towed bubble plume 
can be assumed to match streamlines computed from the velocity field in a real current  
for these steady flows. This supports the analogy of a towed plume to that of a real 
 
33 
 current. These observations suggest that the streamline and streakline along the center 
plane are identical indicating the center plane of  the flow is a symmetry plane, 
furthermore, the observed agreement in trajectories of dye and streamlines implies that 
the vertical and longitudinal advection experienced by the dye agrees with the average 
velocity from the PIV on the center plane only. Th e agreement also verifies the quality 
and accuracy of the time average PIV data.  
From the plots in Figure 9, we also notice that the region where entrainment 
overcomes  the crossflow is clearly visible on the downstream side of the plume. This is 
indicated in the PLIF data where dye has not yet separated from the plume. For the 
streamlines, this region is bounded by the point where the streamlines stop entering the. 
This is in accordance with the theoretical model of (Socolofsky and Adams, 2002b) , 
which hypothesized that separation begins when the crossflow velocity exceeds the 
entrainment velocity on the downwind side of the plume, leading to the onset of dye 
leakage. Note also in the images that entrainment does not resume on the downstream 
side of the bubble column for any height above this point, implying that the bubble 
plume in crossflow is exhausted of its entrainment (i.e., continuously leaks its fluid in 
the wake) above t he separation height.  
The streamlines in Figure 9 display two separate behaviors. First, below the 
separation height, the streamlines point upward, along the rising pl ume, and none of the 
entering streamlines exit the plume until a point at or slightly above the separation 
height. Second,   behavior belongs to the fluid entrained at the base of the plume in 
which the streamlines go up with the plume and exit at or above  the separation height.  
34 
 Second, above the separation height, streamlines enter the plume horizontally on the 
upstream side of the plume and then become advected upward eventually leaving the 
plume on the downstream side, somewhere above the point where the  streamline entered 
the plume. Each of the streamlines are also parallel in nature.  
Whether entrained below the separation height or above it, the fluid exiting the 
plume has vertical momentum, as witnessed by the upward trajectory of the dye and 
streamlin es in the wake.  This vertical velocity stems from transfer of the plume 
buoyancy force of the bubbles to vertical momentum of the ejected water . Above the 
separation height, the lack of entrainment on the downstream side and weaker upward 
trajectory of str eamlines within the bubble column,  lead to the definition of an 
‚Äúexhausted ‚Äù plume : one that no longer increases in volume flux continuously by 
entrainment , and whose size and cross section change only by differential advection and 
diffusion .  Hence,  it evolves to some kind of equilibrium between upstream capture of 
fluid and downstream loss.  
2.5.2.  Investigating the separated phase behavior  
As previously shown by Socolofsky and Adams, (2002b)  for a bubble plume in 
crossflow, above the separation height, the trajecto ry of the separated continuous phase 
may be predicted as that of a single phase momentum jet. Theories of single phase jets 
and plumes are well developed in the literature and different software such as CORMIX 
(Doneker et al., 1990) ,  VISJET, and Visual Plume are widely used for modeling the 
single phase b uoyant jets. Moreover, some commonly used relations based on  
35 
 experiments and dimensional analysis have been reported for jet and plume trajectories; 
such as the relations proposed in Wright, (1977a, b) , and Lee and Chu (2003) . 
The bent -over phase of a turbulent jet or plume in crossflow has been analyzed 
numerically and experimentally using the Advected Line Puff (ALP) and Advected Line 
Thermal (ALT) analogy.  Wright, (1977a, b) and Lee and Chu, (2003)  proposed the 
following power laws for the trajectories of the centerline of jets and plumes in 
crossf low:

momentum and buoyancy length scales used to non -dimensionalize the center line 
distances where 
0vM is the vertical jet momentum flux, 
0F  is the buoyancy flux, and 
aU
is the crossflow velocity . 
As mentioned previously, the trajectory of pure jets in crossflow can be predicted 
by ALP. To investigate the trajectories of bubbly jets in crossflows, Zhang and Zhu, 
(2014)  examined the centerline trajectories of the water and air phase in bubbly jets in 
crossflows  after separation . In their study, the centerline trajectories of the water phase 
were identified from the jet‚Äôs lower and upper boundaries using a photographic 
technique. They modeled the liquid -phase centerlines for bubbly jets with large water  
36 
 flow rate Qw using a single -phase jet model and compared the measured visual centerline 
with the modeled one. They observed some deviations from the measured centerline 
beyond a certain distance from the nozzle for some of their cases due to the lifting 
effects of bubbles on the liquid phase; however, they did not find this bubble induced 
lifting substantial and they concluded that using the single -phase momentum jet model is 
overall satisfactory to model the bubbly jets; hence, they drew the conclusion that the 
centerlines for bubbly jets follow an advected line puff relationship. Nevertheless, they 
did not model the centerline for bubble plumes and bubbly jets with low Qw (i.e., bubble 
plumes), due to the difficulty in determining the centerline in these cases for their 
experimental methods.  
In order to examine the behavior  of the separated continuous phase in bubble 
plumes in an objective way, we investigate the behavior o f the streamlines and the locus 
of the maximum velocities in the wake, defined as the location of maximum velocit y 
magnitudes found  from the PIV velocity field data , as the representatives for the 
trajectory of the separated phase. Figure 10 displays a plot of a representative image of 
dye experiments for case (15 -1). An arbitrary streamline has been picked in the middle 
of the dye and is shown by the yellow line in the  figure. Dark blue lines show the visual 
boundaries of the separated dyes and the red line represents the visual centerline. The 
locus of the maximum velocity magnitude is also plotted on the figure. Streamlines 
follow the visual trajectory of the centerli ne as is delineated in Figure 10 and also 
expected since streamlines have been shown in section 2.5.1 to follow the dye 
trajectories. To further visualize the flow field, a velocity profile a long a vertical transect  
37 
 at x=45 cm has been shown in Figure 11  for this case. Velocities  above the 15 cm/s 
ambient current result from acceleration around the bubble column and within the plume 
below the separation height.

and PLIF results for case of 15 -1

38 
 It is evident from Figure 11 that the trajectory defined by the locus of maximum 
velocities is located higher than the visual centerline of the dye tracer, which is due to 
the pear -shaped structure of the jet in crossflo w as shown in Figure 12 (Lee and Chu, 
2003) ; the visual trajectory is normally defined as the midpoint between the bottom and 
top boundaries of the dye tracer.  
 
Figure 12. Asymptotic flow reg ime showing the vortex -pair concentration profile in the farfield 
for a jet in crossflow adapted  from Lee and Chu, (2003)  
To study the asymptotic behavior of the separated dye plume, Figure 13 present s 
a log -log plot of the plume trajectories based on the velocity data together with the ALP 
and ALT asymptotic slopes. As is evident in Figure 13, the measured maximum 
trajectory line appears to overlays with the streamlines and fits very close to the 2/3 
trajectory law of the ALT. Previous models in the literature assumed the separate d dye 
plume could be modeled using pure jet equations after the gas bubbles separate from the 
plume. Moreover, for these experiments with neutrally buoyant dye, there is no 
 
39 
 buoyancy in the separated plume region. As a result, we would have expected the 
asymptotic slope of the separated plume to have a 1/3 slope, conforming to an advected 
line puff. However, the trajectory given by the streamlines and the locus of maximum 
velocity are experiencing 2/3 slopes. Especially for the cases of stronger crossflows, 
where the separation happens faster and the separated continuous phase exits with lower 
initial velocities.  
 
 Figure 13. Comparison between the slopes of trajectories of separated continuous phase and 
asymptotic power laws of the advected line puffs and line thermals  
To further verify the asymptotic behavior of the separated plume, we found the 
visual centerline of the dye distribution using the instantaneous images from 
experiments. The images were post processed to find the separ ated phase‚Äôs upper and 
lower boundaries and the centerline as the midpoint. However, it should be noted that 
 
40 
 the centerline identified in our study is different from previous studies because of the 
fact that we illuminate the center plane by the laser and the lobes of the counter rotating 
vortex are off this plane and in general would not pass through the laser. Meanwhile, 
they occasionally pass through the laser and can be seen as intermittent dye patches, 
which we neglected. Figure 14 presents an instantaneous image illustrating this 
procedure. Red lines show the centerline we defined from the boundaries that are 
displayed by the blue line.  
 
 Figure 14. Experiments showing bubble plumes in crossflows. Red dashed lines show the 
identified centerline in the center plane dye distribution  
Figure 15 presents the comparison between the slopes of the center dye 
distribution  centerline and the asymptotic power laws. Similar to the behavior of the 
 
41 
 velocity data, the center line trajectories a ppear to deviate from ALP and follow the 2/3 
power law  of the ALT . This behavior is explained by  the fact that the separated phase is 
in a vertically advecting frame of reference , where all the fluid above  the separated 
plume is  experiencing the vertical v elocity resulting from the vertical momentum it 
acquire while passing through the bubble curtain; whereas, in a single phase plume  or jet 
in a crossflow, all the streamlines above the buoyant jet are flat until they intersect the 
plume.   
 
 Figure 15. Visual centerline trajectories and their asymptotic fits  
Since integral plume models predict the trajectory of the maximum velocity 
without knowledge of the vertical velocity in the wake above the separated plume, these 
results suggest  that trajectories from jet models after bubble separation may under -
 
42 
 predict the rise.  The data conform better to the 2/3 slop of the ALT most likely due to 
the upward velocity of fluid separated above the separation height.  This fluid presents a 
backgro und flow field that would be ignored in a single jet integral model. Hence, it is 
important to predict the magnitude of the vertical velocity in the wake of a bubble plume 
above the separation height. In addition, these data are helpful to CFD modelers, wh o 
may be able to validate to the results in this region of the flow where self -similarity is 
not valid.  
2.5.3.  Vertical velocities  
Measured time averaged velocity field information of bubble plume and its wake 
in crossflow have been shown in Figure 16 for different cases. Velocity vectors are 
overlaid with the color contour plots of the vertical components of velocity to better 
quantify and map the vertically -accelerated flui d. These figures show only 4% of the 
measured velocity vectors for clarity; warmer colors represent the region of upward 
flow, and solid black lines identify regions that contain bubbles. As similarly reported by 
Manasseh et al. (1998)  and Socolofsky and Adams  (2002)  the bubble plume 
approximately follows a straight line downstream of the injection location. Persistent 
vertical velocity components in the bubble -column and the wake of the bubble column is 
evident in each case. As noted earlier, crossflow velocity continuously streams the flow 
to the bubble column where the bubbles impart a vertical ki nematic momentum flux to 
the flow; afterwards, the water leaves the bubble plume carrying the vertical momentum 
gained from the bubble column, and this process leads to a vertical motion downstream 
which is shown in the figure by the warm colors. The induc ed vertical motion is more  
43 
 significant for cases with weaker crossflow and larger bubble flow rates, hence, longer 
contact time between the bubbles and water. Also, for weak crossflow cases, the 
entrainment capture zone extends over the whole water column,  resulting in no separated 
plume. As the crossflow gets stronger and the bubble flow rate decreases, vertical 
momentum spreads over a larger region above the separated plume and decreases value.  
 
Figure 16. Velocity vector fields overlaid on the color contours of vertical component of velocity  
 
44 
 To better exemplify how the vertical velocity profiles look at different heights for 
different cases, vertical velocity profiles measured at four different heights above the 
diffuser are show n in Figure 17 for cases (0.04 -1) ‚Äìwith largest separation height -, (0.1 -
1) ‚Äì lowest separation height -, and (0.15 -1). In the weak crossflow case, the plume width 
is relatively narrow and peak velocity decay can be observed along the plume centerline 
as the plume width grows with height. On the other hand, for the strong crossflow cases 
with smaller separation height, vertically -accelerated flow is experienced by the w hole 
wake region, and the PIV field obtained does not extend far enough downstream to see 
the return to zero vertical velocity.  
 
Figure 17. Vertical velocity profiles for 3 different crossflow and 1.0 l/min bubble flow rate  
The significant region of vertically -accelerated flow in the plume wake was first 
reported by (Hugi, 1993) . He showed that the crossflow appears to significantly amplify 
 
45 
 the overall vertical flux induced by a bubble plume, even though the upward velocities 
are smaller than in stagnant water. He viewed t he region of vertically -accelerated flow in 
the plume as a wake behind an upwardly -rising bubble column. In the case of extreme 
crossflow, the bubble column bends close to the horizontal and rises as a line thermal, 
with a vertical wake throughout the regi on below the rising bubble column. Based on 
this definition, (Hugi, 1993)  defined a new coordinate y‚Äô as the vertical distance between 
a given point y and the centerline of the bubble column yc. In his analysis, the centerline 
is given solely by the rise velocity of the bubbles, so that  
s
cuxyuÔÇ•ÔÄΩ
        ( 5 ) 
(Hugi, 1993)  assumed yc value to be a relevant coordinate even if it corresponds 
to a location above the water surface. Likewise, he obtained another length scale similar 
to the characteristic plume length scale in the absence of stratification (
234g
sgQDuÔÅ∞ÔÅ°ÔÄΩ ), 
where he used crossflow velocity and vertical component of the velocity in the 
denominator yielding  
2 hBDuvÔÇ•ÔÄΩ
        ( 6 ) 
He attempted to collapse the velocity profile data in the wake of a bubble plume 
using these two coordinates. The top plot  in Figure 18 presents velocity profiles obtained 
at y = 0.545 m for his experiments. However, the drawback of th is parameter space is 
that it remains dimensional and height dependent on the vertical location above the 
diffuser where the profiles were obtained. The bottom plot  in Figure 18 presents velocity  
46 
 profiles at z/hs = 1.2  for each experiment in Table 1 using a similar parameter space as 
Hugi‚Äôs. Velocity profile data in this figure seems to collapse quite well for the strong 
cases where crossflow velocity can better approximate the line thermal and agreement is 
less for the weak crossflow.

diffuser.

 2.5.4.  Trajectories of water ejected at all levels and predictions of dynamics 
above hs  
To provide a better understanding of the transport above the separation height we 
present the observations of the fluid that enters the plume at different heights. Figure 19 
depicts the path of the streamlines entering the bubble plume at different heights and 
eventually released by the plume in three representative experiments with differ ent 
crossflows and same bubble flow rate. As shown before, water enters the plume 
horizontally and leaves the plume with an increased vertical velocity. Vertical velocity 
of water inside the plume decreases toward the water surface due to the boundary 
interaction, and should be ignored. Close to the diffuser, trajectories are steeper than 
those closer to the water surface where they are ejected with smaller ejection velocities. 
As is evidenced in Figure 19, the streamlines remain straight and parallel; this further 
demonstrates that the vertical velocity which will be translated to the upward flow in the 
wake, can keep its vertical momentum approaching the water surface . 
As the crossflow gets stronger, entrained water leaves the plume and gets ejected 
rather than being contained and transported inside the plume. In these experiments, the 
average vertical transport after the separation height is 3.6  cm for case (0. 10, 1) and 2.3 
cm for case (0.15,1). Prediction of the vertical transport and the residence time of the 
entrained water in the plume is of interest for applications such as lake aeration. As the 
residence time increases, oxygen in air bubbles have more time to di ssolve into flowing 
water through the air -water interface of bubbles. Hence, residence time can impact the 
concentration of dissolved gases downstream.   
48 
    
Figure 19. Trajectories of water ejected at different levels for same bubble flow rate and different 
crossflows, at 1 NL/min air flux  
Presently, available integral plume models are capable of predicting the velocity 
of the bubble plume‚Äôs continuous phase and discrete phase until the separation height 
after which the bubbles a re considered to be advected on their own buoyant velocities 
and the ambient currents. As shown in Figure 19, our observations illustrate that 
streamlines are deflected vertically due to the bubbles. Here we present a conceptual 
model to predict the vertical velocity responsible for this deflection. We assume at any 
level above the separation height, the flux of  the flow across the bubbles are equal, i.e. 
the flux of the ejected water from the leeward side is equal to the flux of the entrained 
water from the windward side, Further, we assume bubbles impart the vertical velocity 
on the fluid inside the bubble plum e by momentum transfer balanced by their drag (or, 
equivalently, their buoyancy). This assumption is verified by the observation of the 
parallel  streamlines above the separation heights ( Figure 19), which indicates that the 
plume is at a quasi -steady state of losing materials at the same rate as they are coming in. 
Thus, the bubble plume is considered to be ‚Äúexhausted‚Äù, implying that all the entrained 
fluid is ejected from the plume and does not stay in the plume.

 To develop a predictive model, we consider a control volume of water with the 
height of dz and radius b and a horizontal velocity equal to the ambient velocity , which 
crosses a bubble plume as shown in Figure 20.

Figure 20. Schematic of control volume considered in exhausted plume analysis  
While passing through the bubble plume, this control volume experiences the buoyancy 
or drag force of the bubbles, and we assume it exits without any changes in its horizontal 
velocity, but with an increased vertical momentum as a result of the buoyant force. 
Conservation of moment um over this control volume yields a relationship for this 
vertical velocity. The simplified force -momentum conservation can be written as:  
ùëâùëúùë¢ùë°‚àó(ùë¢‚àû‚àó(2ùëèùëëùëß))‚àíùëâùëñùëõ‚àó(ùë¢‚àû‚àó(2ùëèùëëùëß))= ùúíùúãùëè2ùëëùëß Œîùúå

where Vout is the vertical velo city upon existing the bubble plume, and Vin is the vertical 
velocity before entering the bubble plume, which is zero. The right hand is essentially 
the buoyancy force exerted from the bubbles, where œá is the void fraction, as is defined 
in (Socolofsky et al., 2008)  as ùúí= ùëöÃáùëù
ùúåùëù(ùúãùëè2(ùë¢ùë†+ùë¢ùëù)) where up is the vertical velocity at the 
middle of the bubble plume. Substituting œá and u p = ¬Ω Vout, as we assume a linear 
velocity distribution in the bubble plume due to the nearly uniform void fraction  
50 
 observed in bubble plumes (Seol and Socolofsky, 2008b) , the solution of equation ( 8) 
yields the vertical velocity of the continuous phase as

Figure 21 compares the model results with the experiment data at the

separation height and the surface effects have been identified from the velocity gradient 
at the surface and exclude d from the comparison data for each case. In Figure 21, the 
highest velocities belong to the case with the weakest crossflow and correspond to lower 
elevations in the  plume. To quantify the difference between the predicted and observed 
vertical velocities, we use the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) which is a 
measure of predicting the accuracy in statistics. MAPE is defined as

2. 6. Conclusion  
This paper presented laboratory experiments of bubble plumes in uniform 
crossflows. Twenty -five fields of views were used to cover the whole field of interest in 
the plume center plane starting from the center of bubble diffuser and mapping an area 
of 65.5cm X 68.5cm. Image processing techniques were applied to eliminate bubble 
signatures. The PIV technique was used to quanti fy the whole velocity field of the 
continuous phase, where recirculation current was generated by a forced current. Further 
measurements include dye visualization using LIF in which crossflow was simulated 
using a towed source. The important conclusions fr om these measurements are 
summarized as follows:  
 
52 
 ÔÇ∑ Comparison between the results from two different sets of experiments which 
simulate ambient current in different ways supported the analogy of the towed 
plume to that of a real current and showed that the t owed source in stagnant 
water can represent a fixed source in crossflow.  
ÔÇ∑ Fluid exiting the plume has vertical momentum throughout the water depth 
gained from the plume‚Äôs buoyancy force.  
ÔÇ∑ Observation showed that no secondary bubble plume would form above the  
separation height and bubble plumes are considered to be ‚Äúexhausted‚Äù of 
entrainment, in other words, in this region, plume is at the steady state of losing 
materials at the same rate as they are coming in.  
ÔÇ∑ Quantified trajectories of the separated continu ous phase deviates from the 
scaling power laws for the advected line puff, which is shown to be experienced 
by the trajectories of pure jets in crossflows; this is due to the induced vertical 
velocities that exist in the wake flow field above the separatio n height. This will 
result in the under prediction of the rise for the separated plume given by integral 
models such as Socolofsky and Adams (2002)  
ÔÇ∑ A conceptual model based on the simplified force -momentum conservation was 
developed to predict the ve rtical velocities induced by the plume above the 
separation height. The simple model results correlates well with our experimental 
observations.  
 53 3. TURBULENT PROPERTIES OF A WAKE BEHIND A ROUND BUBBLE PLUME
IN CROSSFLOWS 
3. 1. Overview 
This study presents results from the analysis of the velocity field and turbulence 
statistics measured downstream of a round bubble plume in the presence of crossflows. 
Experiments were conducted in a glass-walled flume equipped with a recirculation 
system to generate the background flow. The two-dimensional Particle Image 
Velocimetry method was used to measure the velocity field and turbulence intensities in 
the wake of the bubble plume. Profiles of turbulence intensities and Reynolds stresses 
are presented, and the effects of bubbles on turbulence generation are investigated 
experimentally. From the profiles of mean velocity and second order turbulence 
statistics, we found the following. Existence of bubbles affects the mean flow, 
generating an upward mean velocity and augmenting the turbulent intensity. Mean flow 
kinetic energy of the wake was found to be affected by the bubble injection rate and 
crossflow velocity. The wake turbulence is anisotropic with anisotropy being increased 
by increasing the cross flow and bubble flow rate. Finally, we observed that the vortex 
pair structure of the separated plume can be detected by identifying the location of 
maximum Reynolds stresses. 
3. 2. Introduction 
Bubble plumes are highly turbulent flows in nature which can result in efficient 
mixing in many applications. When bubble plumes are exposed to crossflow, separation  
54 
 may occur , where fluid entrained at the base of the bubble plume  may separate fr om the 
trajectory of the bubble column  at a certain separation height, depending on the plume 
and cros sflow parameters (Socolofsky and Adams, 2002b) . A sample experimental 
image showing the  separation height is given  in Figure  22. Figure  22 also illustrates 
several other  features of the flow field for a bubble plume in a moving am bient, 
including the separated bubbles, separated entrained plume  in the downstream wake , and 
the wake region above the separation height. In this study, we investigate the turbulence 
nature of the flow  field throughout  the wake. Understanding the mixing p rocesses and 
the flow induced by a bubble plume  in crossflow is of importance for the design and 
optimization of many of their applications. For example, lake destratification and 
aeration systems that use bubble plumes are open to the question s of to what  extent the 
bubble plume mixes the stratified ambient and enriches the oxygen concentration.  
Although turbulence properties in bubble plumes have been studi ed in quiescent 
conditions, less attenti on has  been paid to the turbulence properties of the induced  flow 
in the presence of the crossflows. The purpose of the present work is to account for this 
need by using velocity data obtained from a set of Particle Image Velocitmetry  
experiments. These results are important to understand the fundamental turbulent nature 
of the wake and can be used for verification of modeling approaches in CFD codes for 
bubble plume analysis.

Turbulence properties in bubble plumes in quiescent conditions have been 
measured in several studies . (Tekeli and Maxwell, 1978)  did one of the first works and 
reported values of turbulence intensities in bubble plume in a medium -scale, bubble -
plume facility. (Simiano et al., 2006)  used PIV methods and reported average turbulent 
intensities and mean turbulent stresses within a bubb le plume  near its source . (Bryant et 
al., 2009b)  applied PIV methods to quantify plume -scale turbulence properties in a 
bubble plume farther from the source, into the asymptotic regime of the plume 
dynamics . (Bryant et al., 2009b)  observed that the presence of bubbles in the flow can 
modulate the turbulent energy spectrum in the inertial subrange, which had been  
56 
 observed  previously  for point -wise measurements (e.g., Lance and Bataille, 1991; 
Rensen et al., 2005) . (Bryant et al., 2009b)  also found the greatest vortex size and energy 
density in the shear layers at the edge of the round plume, indicating that shear 
instability is the dominant process of large -scale turbulent and coherent structure 
generation in pure bubble plumes. These studies provide important insight on the 
turbulence struct ures inside and outside the bubble plumes in the quiescent condition. 
However, they did not investigate the turbulence properties of the flow in the wake 
downstream of a bubble column  in a moving environment . 
Turbulence in obstructed flows has been studied  in open channels.  (Nepf, 1999; 
Nepf et al., 1997)  performed laboratory experiments and measured turbulence intensities 
in presence of vegetation and showed that vegetation affects the turbulence intensity 
through converting mean kinetic energy into turbulent kinetic energy linked to the wake 
generatio n behind plant stems .  The model they proposed for this effect predicts that 
turbulence intensity increases with the introduction of sparse vegetation but then 
decreases with increasing population density as mean flow speed becomes  reduced. 
Bubbly flow may  be similar to the flow through stems; in a frame of reference moving 
with the bubbles, bubbles resemble the stems, except that they are three dimensional.  
Hence, similar effects may be observed in the bubble plume wake.  
To add insights to the turbulent pr operties and scales in the bubble plume wake 
in the presence of crossflow and to investigate how the turbulence behaves  in the wake 
region , this paper applies PIV to identify variance structure of velocities including mean 
turbulent stresses and turbulent intensities in the bubble plume wake in the presence of a  
57 
 current. The l aboratory and data processing methods are reported in section 3.3, which  
detail s the designed experimental setup and the data analysis methods. Section 3.4  
presents t he results section  of the measured PIV data to show the instantaneous and 
turbulent flow properties.  The summary and conclusions are presented in section 3.5.  
3. 3. Laboratory experiments  
3.3.1 Experiment setup  
The experiments were conducted in a glass -walled flume 35 m long by 0.9 m 
wide and 1.2 m deep in the Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the Zachry Department of 
Civil Engineering at Texas A&M University. The tank is equipped with a recirculation 
pump system to simulate different ambient currents. In order to destroy the jet structure 
of the inflow at the flume entrance, an array of bricks was placed immediately after the 
inflow (Ghisalberti and Nepf (2002) ). A homogeneous grid of porous plates was then 
used to smooth the velocity profi le as suggested by Stoker (1946) . Flow straighteners 
made  out of PVC pipes with a diameter of 2.54cm and length of 70cm were used to 
eliminate the large scale t urbulence and secondary currents.  The bubble plume was 
located 19 times the water depth downstream of the flow straightener. To generate the 
bubble plume , a 1.4 cm -diameter aquarium airstone was used  at a height of 14.5cm 
above the flume bottom . 
We chose the bubble flow rates as Qo = 0.5, 1 and 1.5 NL/min to match the 
previous experiments with zero crossflow (D.-G. Seol et al., 2007) . The bubble flow  
rates at standard pressure and temperature were monitored by a gas mass flowmeter. The  
58 
 generated air bubbles had a median diameter d50 of 2.4 mm as measured by Lai and 
Socolofsky  (2015) in a similar setup, with a corresponding slip velocity of 24 cm/s ( Clift 
et al., 2005) . Three different ambient currents (u ‚àû), i.e. 4, 10 and 15 cm/s were simulated 
in a way that combined with the bubble flow rates, c ould span a range of separation 
heights (i.e., no separation, weak separation, and strong separation). Table 2 summarizes 
the full range of experimental conditions me asured in this section.

The center plane of the bubble plume was illuminated by a laser sheet formed 
from a continuous Argon -ion laser (Spectra - Physics) and associated optics. A mirror 
was placed on the flume bottom to make the horizontal laser sheet vertical. The flume 
water wa s seeded with neutrally buoyant homopolymer polyamide particles 
(manufactured by Vestonic) of mean diameter 56 micron and of specific gravity 1.03.  
Flow images were captured by a high speed Phantom camera mounted on a 
three -dimensional traverse and positio ned perpendicularly to the light sheet. The camera  
59 
 frame rate was 200Hz and the exposure time was 300 microseconds , capturing upto 
2000 frames per measurement burst (limited by physical RAM of the camera) . The 
resolution of the camera was 1024√ó1024 pixels with a gray scale dynamic range of 10 
bits. In order to cover the whole field of interest, 25 fields of view (FOV) were used 
starting from the center of the bubble diffuser. Each FOV had a dimension of 15√ó15 cm 
with 1.5 cm overlap. Figure 23 shows a schematic of the raster of camera FOVs and the 
reconstruction of the grid plate image captured from each camera FOV  after geometric 
correction . Measurements commenced in FOV(1,1) and followed an S -pattern through 
FOV(5,5). The light patches surrounding each individual image in the reconstruction 
indicate the overlap for each camera FOV.  Note that the last column of frames had an 
overlap of 5cm due to the limitation on the maximum range  of the traverse.

image shows the naming convention for each FOV (e.g., (1, 1) for the first row and the first 
column), and the right ima ge shows the corrected images of the calibration  grid plate.   
 
60 
 Image sequences for the PIV analysis were acquired in 2000 -image bundles, each 
representing 10 seconds of experimental run time. To get a stable mean velocity, 
experiments were repeated three ti mes at each FOV, which resulted in 30 seconds of 
data, or 6015 images at each flow rate  and crossflow combination . Hence, PIV 
sequences are neither synoptic from FOV to FOV nor are the data contiguous over the 
whole 30 s at each measurement point; therefor e, we rebuilt the flow field from 
statistical averages of the results, including mean velocity, turbulence intensity, and 
Reynolds tresses. Figure 24 shows the schematic set up of the experiments.  
 
Figure 24.  Schematic of the PIV set up 
3.3.2 Image preprocessing  
Bubble signatures were removed from the raw images before applying the PIV 
algorithm to calculate the continuous phase velocities using a size and brightness 
61 discrimination method for separating the bubbles as previously explained in Section 2. 
Because of the removal of the bubbles, data at the plume core for each picture would be 
insufficient. This insufficiency is circumvented by time averaging over the total 
experiment duration of 30s, thereby obtaining the mean velocity inside the plume core. 
Also, the bubble region suppresses the amount of laser light passing through the bubbles; 
consequently, instantaneous and turbulence data are too noisy at the region upstream of 
the bubble column.  
3.3.3 PIV analysis procedure 
The LaVision Davis software package was used to perform the PIV processing 
and obtain the velocity vector field. Velocities were calculated from the regular cross-
correlation PIV algorithm using a multiple pass interrogation window with 50% overlap. 
The iterations used an initial window size of 64 by 64 pixels and a final interrogation  
window size of 32 by 32 pixels, yielding a uniform vector grid of 2.3 by 2.3 mm. To  
remove the vectors that do not accurately represent the flow field, a median filter was  
applied to the resulting velocity field by comparing each vector to the root mean square 
of the 8 surrounding vectors. A sample of the resulting instantaneous velocity field for  
one camera FOV is shown in Figure 25 .

3. 4. Results  
The results presented in this section investigate mixing in the wake to shed light 
on the understanding of the role of bubbles in injecting turbulence in the wake region 
when crossflow is present.  
3.4.1 Turbulent i ntensities  
Turbulence intensity is computed from

        ( 9 ) 
 
63 
 where 
'u  and 
'v  are the velocity fluctuations in the x and y directions, respectively and 
U
is the mean crossflow. The results shown in this section were obtained from 
ensemble averaging over 6015 instantaneous v elocity measurements  at each point . 
Figure 26 shows the turbulence intensity fields for different cases of crossflows and 
bubble flow rates. High value s of ti can be observed at the overlap region of PIV fields, 
which is an artifact of the PIV process due to its high uncertainty at the edges  of each 
FOV . However, the trends are still significant and we did not remove this data even 
though the uncertainties are higher.  
The observations show that turbulence intensities increase with increasing the 
bubble flow rate but then decrease with increasing the ambient current. The solid lines in 
the figure outline the bubble column. The thick plus signs show the trajectory of the 
maximum time -averaged velocity, which follows the upper third of the plume of 
entrained water that separates at the separation height (Rezvani and Socolofsky 2015, 
Socolofsky and Adams 2002). The regions of highest turbulence intensity are 
consistently below this trajectory line and correlate with  the edges of the upward rising 
separated fluid in the wake  (as identified in corresponding experiments using dye; (see 
Figure  22), indicating that the velocity shear between the bottom of the separated plume 
and the ambient exhibit the greate st turbulence intensities. Observations show that 
mixing is primarily within the plume generated by the rising bubbles where bubbles 
incre ase the turbulent intensity by an order of magnitude comparing to the case where 
there are no bubble s.  
64 
 The graphs  of turbulence intensity  further show  that before introducing  the 
bubbles  (top row of Figure 26), there is a region with high turbulence intensity at the left 
corner of the plot which is due to the separation caused by the diffuser structure. Note 
that the flume bottom boundary layer is well below the region  covered by these 
measurements. I n cases with no bubble plumes, turbulence intensity is negligible over 
the flow field except for the diffuser structure affecte d region; hence, this is a low -
turbulence forced current.  
  
65 
  
Figure 26. Plots of turbulence intensi ty for different cases of cross flow and bubble flow rate  
together with streamlines of the time average velocity , and trajectory of the maximum time 
average velocity.  
Figure 27 compares vertical profiles of turbulence intensities at different current 
velocities and bubble flow rates and reveals the changes in the turbulence intensity at 
two non -dimensionilzed locations of x/hs = 2 and x/hs = 2.5. For this figure, the surface 
recirculation zone has been removed.  For comparison, the vertical axis is normalized by 
the separation height for each case. As evident in the figure, the main shape of the 
profiles is similar across experiments using this axis scaling. In general, turbulence 
 
66 
 intensity increases due to the introductio n of the bubbles. As Q increases , the turbulence 
intensity increases  due to  the increased blockage by the bubbles , providing higher degree 
of bubble wakes . This observation is i n agreement with similar measurements for the 
flow through  vegetation,  where (Nepf et al., 1997)  observed enhanced turbulence 
intensity as the population density of vegetation increased. Meanwhile, average 
turbulence intensity decreases as the crossflow increases  likely due to a reduced contact 
time between the crossflow and the bubble column . The profiles of the turbulence 
intensities also suggest that the flow consisted of two regions. Near the separation height
1
sy
hÔÄΩ
, the turbulence  intensity shows a maximum value. This region is associated with 
the separated plume of water entrained near the source and which has the longest contact 
time with the bubbles. Above and below this area, the turbulence intensity remains 
elevated as water m ust flow through the bubble column to enter the wake.

3.4.2 Reynolds s tresses  
Reynolds stresses are understood  as a source of turbulent transport and stirring , 
and based on the Reynolds analogy for mass transfer, higher mixing can be anticipated at 
locations of higher Reynolds stresses. Figure 28, Figure 29, and Figure 30 show the Ruu, 
Rvv, and Ruv components of the Reynolds Stresses, respectively, for different cases in this 
study. These plots show the clear shear -flow boundary between the upward -rising 
bubble plume , the separat ed plume fluid , and the wake flow outside the plume. For the 
case of weak separation, the shear -flow boundary is confined close to the bubble core, 
and for the cases with lower separation heights, this boundary flows with a mild angle 
into the downstream w ake. By comparison to the wake structure , the regions of highest 
Reynolds stresses also lie on the lower boundary between the upward -rising separated 
plume and the background horizontal wake flow. It is also evident that throughout the 
 
68 
 region of rising flu id in the downstream wake, mixing is enhanced, showing elevated 
Reynolds stresses. Comparison between the horizontal and vertical components suggests 
that agitation covers a wider area in the vertical fluctuations , suggesting there is a 
linkage directly to  the vertical bubble motion and bubble wakes .

3.4.3 Isotropy  
Figure 31 presents the difference between the vertical and horizontal as a metrics 
for isotropy in the wake region. As shown in the  column of plots , the background flow is 
essentially  isotropic with some anisotropy created due to the existence of the diffuser 
struc ture at the bottom left of the measurement domain, which become s larger by 
increasing the crossflow. With bubble injection, d ifferent degrees of separation between 
the weak and strong crossflow cause different behavior in the wake region. Hot color 
 
71 
 regions  depict where vertical fluctuations are larger  and cool color regions stand for 
regions with larger horizontal fluctuations.  
For the cases with strong crossflow, yellow regions cover a larger area in the 
wake. This region is created due to the vertical mom entum  that is injected  by the 
bubbles , and the crossflow transports it downstream ; i.e., vertical velocity is added to the 
fluid going through the bubble column  and streams  into the wake. There is a distinct 
blue region in the middle of the separated plume , which shows that this region has 
higher horizontal fluctuations. Meanwhile , it should be noted that these components do 
not belong to the principal axis of the Reynolds stress tensor , and  for the separated 
plume and for further interpretations, the coord inates on the centerline and principal axis 
for each point should be computed. Below the separated plume, there is a region with 
high vertical fluctuation which is showing the high entrainment region. That is where 
entrainment is coming in and water is bei ng entrained from the below. Flow becomes 
smoothed out below this region.  
It can be seen in the figure that the introduction of bubbles creates anisotropy in 
the wake region. Anisotropy is noted to increase  with increasing gas flux  and with 
increasing crossflow . Anisotropy introduced by bubbles has been observed in stagnant 
bubble plumes where Simiano et al., (2006)  reported strong anisotropy in the plume area 
in his experiments. These plot s further indicate  that the separated plume is unique from 
the rest of the wake , with  transport being  different above  and below  the separation 
height .

3.4.4 Mean flow kinetic energy  
In order to investigate the distribution  of kinetic energy that is input from the 
bubbles in the wake region, we compute  the kinetic energy of the mean velocity field  
defined by
ÔÄ®ÔÄ©22 12K U VÔÄΩÔÄ´ . Figure 32 shows the difference between the K field with 
the bubble column and that of the corresponding current field without bubbling; warm 
colored regions show the areas with elevated kinetic energy. Although overall, 
horizontal velocities are decreased in the wake, the increased values of kinetic energy 
stem from the increased vertical velocities linked to the effect  of the bubbles. The 
 
73 
 generated mean flow is in agreement with Lai and Socolofsky ( 2015 ), study who show 
that the potential energy lost by a bubble rising in a water column after reaching its 
terminal velocity is transferred to the water surrounding it. In a bubble plume, the 
potential energy loss in the bubbles results in generation of mean flow as well as 
turbulence. Some observations can be made here. First, kinetic energy is highest in the 
separated plume, where water has had the longest contact time with the bubbles . Second, 
the wake region above the separated plume is also significantly affected as water  must 
flow through the bubble column to reach this region . As the bubble flow rate increase s 
the amount of energy introduced in the wake increases .

velocity , and trajectory of the maximum time average velocity.  
3.4.5 Identification of vortex pair structure from the Reynolds stresses  
As already shown in Figure 33, the measurements in these experiments have 
been carried out on a vertical plane through the centerline of the diffuser  and resulting 
plane -wake structure . Previous numerical simulations and lab experiments in single 
phase flow (e.g., (Tian and Roberts, 2003) ) predict and show the existence of the vortex 
pair in the section view of a jet in crossflow , which is delineated schematically in Figure 
33. A similar vortex structure is expected for the separated plume in the wake of a 
 
75 
 bubble column. The signature of this vortex pair has been seen in the above results, 
where elevated turbulence  intensity and Reynolds stresses are observed at the base of the 
separated plume. TO verify this interpretation, we present results from similar 
experiments with dye injection used to track the separated plume, visualized on the same 
plume centerline by Pl anar Induced Fluorescence (PLIF).  Observations of  the PLIF 
image sequences demonstrate  this structure by the sudden appearance of dye patches 
which were transported by this vortex pair  into the centerplane by weak side -t-side 
meandering of the plume . These  bottom traces  of dye can visualize the  vertical  extent of 
these vortices.

Figure 34 shows representative instantaneous LIF images together with the 
location of the maximum vertical and horizontal turbulent Reynolds stresses. As 
delineated in the figure, the maximum Rey nolds stresses correspond  with the bottom , 
intermittent dye region. These dye patches are not visible in al l PLIF images, and indeed,  
we are capturing some of the intermittency on the two lobes of the vortex pair created 
because of the side to side wonderi ng of the plume which in turn is augmenting  the

 Reynolds  stresses . This suggests  that the maximum  Reynolds stresses are associated 
with the bottom of the vortex pair . Hence , the maximum  Reynolds stresses appear to  
show  the convergence zone at the base of t he vortex pair. Meanwhile, the trajectory of 
the maximum averaged velocity  magnitude is  located at the top of this vortex pair 
structure.

3. 5. Summary and conclusion  
This paper presented laboratory experiments of bubbl e plumes in uniform 
crossflow. Instantaneous v elocity information in the downstream wake of a round bubble 
plume in presence of crossfl ows was obtained using PIV measurements. These data were  
 
77 
 used for examining the propertie s of turbulence in the wake of the  bubble plu me. 
Turbulence intensities and Reynolds s tress terms were obtained from the instantaneous 
velocity data. Results showed th at bubbles can modify the liquid turbulence, and 
turbulence intensity increases with the increase in the introduction of bubbles  and 
decreases with the increase in the crossflow . Profiles of turbulence intensities and 
Reynolds stresses showed that maximum values occur at the bottom interface of the 
separated plume and ambient fluid. The difference between the vertical and horizontal 
fluctuation was studied as an issue of isotropy. Observation showed that agitation covers 
a wider area in the vertical fluctua tions, while the separated plume is shown as a distinct 
region with higher horizontal fluctuations. Furthermore, increasing the bubble flow rate 
and crossflow would increase the anisotropy of the wake turbulence , where the 
background flow is initially isot ropic before introducing the bubbles. The distribution of 
the increase in the kinetic energy of the mean flow induced by the bubbles was also 
shown. The increase is not uniformly distributed, but is concentrated in the separated 
plume and the downstream re gion above the separation height. Moreover, observations 
show that the location of the maximum Reynolds stress es corresponds to the base of the 
vortex pair structure  for the separated plume.  78 4. FIELD STUDY OF LAKE SEDIMENT OXYGEN UPTAKE IN TWO AERATED
LAKES:  ROLE OF CURRENTS AND TURBULENCE IN THE BOTTOM 
BOUNDARY LAYER 
4. 1. Overview 
This paper presents the results of field measurements for two field campaigns 
conducted in two different lakes with different natural currents and bubble plume 
aeration installations. The gas flow rates of the diffusers in each lake were manually 
varied  during each campaign to study the oxygen response if the lake to aeration. The 
effects of artificial and natural currents on the sediment oxygen uptake were also studied  
through in situ  measurements of temperature, dissolved oxygen profiles, current 
velocities and wind data. Analysis of all the data showed that the bubble plume 
oxygenation influences the sediment oxygen uptake mainly by increasing the oxygen 
concentration of the hypolimnion, thereby increasing the concentration gradient and 
diffusive flux at the sediment-water interface. Also, changing the bubble flow rate can 
excite internal waves,  which in turn generate unsteady currents. Finally, we validate a 
physics-based predictive model for the flux of oxygen across the sediment-water 
interface as a result of mixing induced by the natural and bubble plume induced artificial 
currents. A hydrodynamic model, based on the film-renewal model, was applied, which 
predicts the boundary layer thickness and oxygen uptake rate based on the ambient 
turbulence.  An analytical model was needed for these weak turbulence environments to 
relate the measured turbulence dissipation rate to the eddy renewal time. Validation of  
79 
 the model to the field measurements showed that the large eddy model best predicted the 
observed  oxygen uptake . 
4. 2. Introduction  
Low Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentration in the hypolimnia of lakes and 
reservoirs is a significant global concern and is undesirable due to its negative impacts 
on water treatment, cold -water fisheries (Wu et al., 2003) , and water quality downstream 
of hydropower dams (Little and McGinnis, 2001) . Chemical, biological, and physical 
mechanisms all act to reduce DO in lakes and reservoirs.  Excessive amounts of 
phosphorous increase the production of organic matter, which eventually dies and settles 
to the lake bottom, where oxygen depletion occurs d uring decomposition.  At the same 
time, stable density stratification, particularly in the summer, limits the connectivity 
between the hypolimnion and atmosphere, thereby inhibiting DO replenishment by 
surface aeration, which likewise leads to low DO.  In managed lakes, hypolimnetic 
oxygenation (HOx) systems are increasingly utilized to replenish DO while preserving 
the dimictic nature of the lakes (i.e. thermal stratification).  Oxygen depletion, however, 
may be affected by the oxygenation since the sedime nt oxygen uptake is regulated by 
increased oxygen concentration and near -sediment hydrodynamics. Consequently,  HOx 
systems have been historically undersized because of the underestimation of the oxygen 
uptake magnitude  during aeration  (Beutel, 2003) .  In the case of bubble plumes , which 
are commonly used for oxygenation (W√ºest et al., 1992) , two important questions are: to 
what  extent do the currents generated by the operation of the bubbl e plume along with 
other natural phenomen a affect the sediment -oxygen uptake, and how  does the uptake  
80 
 depend on  the bottom turbulence and oxygen concentration profiles  in the hypolimnion .  
Here, we address these questions by analyzing currents and turbulen ce properties 
measured in the boundary layers of two different aerated lakes during multiple, 
interdisciplinary field campaigns that varied the bubble plume operation.  Successfully 
managing the water quality of lakes and reservoirs is crucial to the globa l water 
economy, and the importance of this work lies in understanding of the role of bubble 
plumes on  altering the  sediment oxygen uptake and developing predictive tools for 
numerical models of managed lakes.  
Sediment -water fluxes occur within the Diffusi ve Boundary Layer (DBL) which 
is the millimeter -scale layer just above the sediment. The  flux of oxygen at the sediment -
water interface (SWI) JO2 can be predicted by  Fick‚Äôs law as  
ùêΩùëÇ2= ‚àíùê∑ ùúïùê∂
ùúïùëß         ( 10 ) 
where D is taken as t he molecular diffusivity since turbulence vanishes in the viscous 
sublayer at the interface , C is the oxygen concentration, and z is the vertical coordinate . 
Substituting  the analytical solution for the one -dimensional transport equation in 
quiescent conditions (ùê∂(ùëß,ùë°)‚àíùê∂ùëÜùëäùêº
ùê∂ùëèùë¢ùëôùëò ‚àíùê∂ùëÜùëäùêº = 1- erf (‚àíùëß
‚àö4ùê∑ùë°)) for C in Equation (1 1), and taking the 
diffusive boundary layer thickness ùõøùê∑ùêµùêø =‚àö2ùê∑ùë° , the flux can be expressed as  
ùêΩùëÇ2=‚àíùê∑ (ùê∂ùëèùë¢ùëôùëò ‚àíùê∂ùëÜùëäùêº )
ùõøùê∑ùêµùêø      ( 11 ) 
where Cbulk and CSWI are the oxygen concentrations within the bulk fluid outs ide the 
DBL and at the Sediment -Water Interface (SWI), as depicted in  Figure 35, and Œ¥DBL is 
the characteristic  DBL thickness. Th e concentration at the sediment -water interface  
81 
 remains close to zero  due to the near instantaneous oxygen consumption by 
biodegra dation in the sediments , therefore, the sediment oxygen flux is controlled by: 1) 
the concentration within the bulk fluid (Cbulk), which is controlled by the lake chemistry , 
biology, and aeration by HO x systems and 2) the theoretical thickness of the DBL, which 
is affected by the hydrodynamics and turbulent mixing in the BBL (Lorke et al., 2003) . 
 
Figure 35. Key components of a DO profile across the SWI ( reprinted  from Bryant et al., 
(2010a) . Zmax is the depth of the oxic zone in the sediment side. On the water side, BBL, DBL 
and oxygen conc entrations at the SWI and bulk of water are demonstrated . 
Previous studies showed the importance of hydrodynamics on the thickness and 
structure of the DBL (J√∏rgensen and Revsbech, 1985 , Roy et al . 2002 ).  The increas e in 
the sediment oxygen uptake as a result of increased water velocity near the sediment 
surface has been observed in laboratory experiments using sediment core incubations 
(Beutel, 2003; Josiam and Stefan, 1999; Moore et al., 1996) . In their field study, Lorke 
et al.  (2003)  showed JO2 responds to changes in the near -sediment turbulence and 
proposed that the turbulence characterized by the dissipation rate is the primary driver 
 
82 
 for flux changes in less energetic and periodically forced systems such as lakes. Bryant 
et al. (2010)  observed the same influence from turbulence in response to  natural seiche 
activity; using oxygen microprofiles, they observed a significant response from JO2 to 
near-sediment turbulence on hourly time scales.  
This study performs experiments in two morphologically different lakes , aerated 
with bubble plume diffusers. Bubble plumes solve the low DO problem  in the 
hypolimnion  by successfully adding oxygen.  Even so, they may stimulate the uptake  of 
oxygen by increasing oxy gen concentrations and by  adding energy through flow induced  
by the bubble plume buoyancy , which may generate near -field turbulence locally , close  
to the diffuser , and large -scale currents , especially in winter times when stratification 
may be  destroyed by the diffuser, and these shoul d be considered in the HOx design and 
operation. McGinnis et al.  (2004)  showed the enhanced mixing in the bubble plume near 
field induced by diffuser operation using field observation and computer simulations. 
Computer simulations by Singleton et al.  (2010)  showed the circulation of hypolimnetic 
water that could be stimulated by the bubble -plume oxygenation systems even at low gas 
flow rates. Gantzer et al., (2009)  showed these HOx -induced increase s in turbul ent 
mixing , which they identified by higher warming rates, may cause excessive 
hypolimnetic oxygen uptake in small reservoirs  which  is similar to the effects of the 
seiche -induced turbulence, shown to cause significant variability in the sediment oxygen 
uptake (Bryant et al., 2010a) . Later, Bryant et al.  (2011)  observed the effect of these 
large -scale currents in a small sheltered reservoir through the behavior of the SWI far 
field of the bubble plume diffuser upon turning the diffuser off. In their field study, JO2  
83 
 rapidly  decreased upon turning off the diffuser , yet, it took nearly 8 days for the  diffuser 
to replenish the water overlaying the sediment with oxygen after the diffuser was turned 
back on.  
Despite the current broad application of bubble plumes in lakes , little is known 
about if /how turbulence changes caused by bubble plume operations affect JO2 in the 
field, where Jo2 can be significantly affected by natural turbulence as well. Bryant et al.  
(2011)  assessed in situ how HOx -induced variation in near sediment mixing and oxygen 
concentrations influence JO2 by correlating the  JO2, current velocity , and mixing 
calculated from the oxygen data ; they obser ved high levels of correlations and they 
proposed HOx operation  may have a strong influence  on the mixing and sediment 
oxygen uptake. However, hydrodynamic data was restricted in their study due to the lack 
of near -sediment velocity measurements, and turbu lent dissipation rates were calculated 
from JO2 and Œ¥DBL measurements , thus were not independent. They used a correlation 
between Œ¥DBL and the viscous boundary layer as is proposed in W√ºest and Lorke  (2003)  
and then estimated friction velocity from the correlation between the viscous boundary 
layer thickness and the friction velocity (Schlichting, 1979) . Finally, they calculated 
dissipation rates from the friction velocities using the law -of-the-wall assumptions. 
Nonetheless, a s shown by Lorke et al.  (2002) , this as sumption may not be valid for the 
oscillatory unsteady BBL flow  common in lakes . To overcome this weakness, in this 
paper  we directly measure the dissipation rates from high resolution velocity data  near 
the DBL .  
84 
 Furthermore, it would be beneficial for the  numerical models and for designing 
bubble plume diffusers to more accurately predict the induced sediment oxygen uptake. 
The current best practice is the use of an induced hypolimnetic oxygen uptake multiplier 
as a factor of safety  (Beutel, 2003; Moore et al., 1996) . Several models are proposed in 
the literature to predict the flux of gas across the interface  (Lorke and Peete rs, 2006; 
Socolofsky and Jirka, 2005 ;O‚Äôconnor et al . 2009 ). Since  models exist in  the literature for 
boundary exchange that include the near -sediment velocity and turbulence, the purpose 
of this study is to assess the performance of these models using  simultaneous in situ  field 
measurements of JO2, velocity, and turbulence to study the link between bubble plume 
operation and boundary exchange.  
To address these gaps, we investigate d the physical processes that control oxygen 
uptake in two distinct lakes exhibiting  low bottom velocities and negligible inflows and 
outflows that are aerated by bubble plume diffusers. These lakes have different 
morphology and wind forcing so that they experience different coherent motions  and 
internal waves near the sediments.  Using high -resolution chemical and hydrodynamic 
data, we acquired direct measurements of  JO2, velocity , and turbulence and analyzed the 
results  to test the hypothesis that bubble plume operation will stimulate oxygen uptake 
and that this partly results fr om currents induced by the bubble plume; oxygen uptake is 
also assumed to increase during oxygenation due to the elevated oxygen concentration in 
the hypolimnion, and this work attempts to quantify the contribution from these two 
mechanisms . To this end, w e discuss the temporal variability of the oxygen  uptake rate 
and investigate if and how the bubble flow rate provides a physical control for the  
85 
 observed variability.  In the end, we synthesis these data to produce a predictive model 
for JO2 that depends on  the turbulence in the hypolimnion.  
This paper is organized as follows. Section 4.3 presents the study sites, 
measurement methods, diffuser operation, and the campaign schedule. In section 4.4 , we 
use concentration measurements at the SWI to compute JO2 and introduce the main 
predictive models we will consider. Section 4.5 presents the observations of the lake 
physics including fine -scale BBL turbulence, meteorological forcing, lake mixing state, 
and basin scale motions. This section also discusses the in terplay of the dynamics across 
these many scales and the resulting behavior in the BBL. Section 4.6 synthesizes these 
measurements to validate a predictive model for JO2 and compare the JO2 dynamics to 
bubble plume diffuser operation. The final section, se ction 4.7, presents the summary 
and conclusions along with recommendations for future modeling studies in these lakes.  
4. 3. Materials and methods  
4.3.1 Two contrasting lake study sites  
We carried out field measurement campaigns in Carvin‚Äôs Cove Reservoir, 
Virginia (C CR) in 2013 and in Lake Hallwil  (LH) , Switzerland in 2012. These are 
different lakes with different natural currents and aeration installations, which provide us 
with different flow regimes. Lake properties are summarized in Table 3. For each field 
campaign the diffuser operation was varied per the design goals given in section 4.3.5.

CCR is located in southwestern Virginia and is the main drinking water supply 
for the county of Roanoke, Virginia, USA. CCR is eutrophic and relatively shallow, with 
a maximum depth of 23 m, a width of about 600 m, and a length of about 800 0 m. CCR  
is mild ly susceptible to wind -driven forcing, but is also protected by the surrounding 
hills and has weak inflows. The oxygenation diffuser in CCR reservoir  consists of two, 
parallel line -source diffusers,  located along the edge of the deepest region of the 
hypol imnion near the reservoir dam. The CCR HOx system injects pure oxygen over a 
wide range of flow rates which facilitates operational flexibility. Bubbling occurs in the 
summer months, when seasonal stratification leads to oxygen depletion, with the goal to 
minimize soluble Fe2+ and Mn2+ in the source water  ( Gantzer et al., 2009) . Figure 36 
shows the plan view and bathymetry of CCR.   
87

Lake Hallwil (LH) is a deep, medium -sized natural lake located north of 
Lucerne, Switzerland. LH is eutropic. It is 8.3 km long, 1.4 km wide, and has an average 
depth of about 29 m with a maximum depth of about 47 m. Figure 37 shows the 
bathymetry of this lake. River -induced currents are insignificant  in this lake as the mean 
inflow rate is 2.3 m3/s.  LH is surrounded by low mounta ins along its main axis on both 
western and eastern sides and therefore, strong winds are predominantly along the lake‚Äôs 
main axis. LH undergoes thermal stratification in the summer and often experiences 
strong, wind driven  seiche cycles. During the strati fied period , it becomes anoxic in the 
 
88 
 hypolimnion as a result of high oxygen consumption. In order to aerate the hypolimnion, 
diffusers are arranged in a circle of six pods at the deepest region of the hypolimnion, 
near the center of the lake  (see Figure 37 for details) .  The system delivers pure oxygen  
gas in summer oxygenation mode and can pump air or oxygen in winter as needed.  
 
Figure 37. Bathymetry of Lake Hallwil. Diffusers are shown in the map  
We used a combination of instruments  moored at various locations in the 
hypolimnia of these lakes to  observ e and assess the effects of oxygenation in each field 
campaign . Figure 36 and Figure 37 show the locations of the mooring sites (marked as 
 
89 
 the microprofiler). The remaining sections describe these instruments and the logistics of 
the field campaigns.  
4.3.2 Oxygen microstructure at the  lake bottom  
A bottom lander equipped with a microprofiler measured fine -resolution profiles 
of oxygen and temperature above and through the SWI (Bryant et al., 2010b) . The 
microprofiler (Unisense MP -4) was equipped with two microsensors (one Clark -type 
oxygen sensor and one thermocouple temperature s ensor, Unisense A/S). The profiler  
acquired complete profiles every 50 minutes at steps of  up to 0.1mm from 10 cm above 
to 0.5 cm below the SWI, deep enough to reach zero DO in the sediment. Resolution was 
set to be 10 -mm from 10 cm to 1 cm above the SWI, 1-mm resolution from 1 cm to 0.5 
cm above the SWI, and 0.1mm resolution from 0.5 cm above to 0.5 cm below the SWI. 
A detailed analysis of the oxygen measurements  from these field campaigns  can be 
found in Bierlein  et al. (2015) . 
4.3.3 Hydrodynamic measurements i n the bottom boundary layer  
An Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV, Nortek Vector) was deployed on a 
separate frame close to the microprofiler to continuously measure the three -dimensional 
velocity in a small measurement volume. The ADV was mounted  such that  the 
measuring volume was about 15 -20 cm above the SWI, varying among deployments; 
sample rate also varied by deployment, fixed at 16 or 8 Hz.  The temporal resolution was 
adequate in each deployment to capture the structure of the turbulence s tatistics in to the 
inertial sub range of the flow.   
90 
 To capture the spatial structure of the bottom boundary layer, a high -resolution 
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP, Nortek Aquadopp with high resolution  
firmware ) was moored above the sediment -water interface in a down -looking orientation  
on the same frame as the ADV . With the ADCP, we could measure the very low current 
velocities in the BBL of these lakes with rather high spatial and temporal resolution. We 
operated the ADCP in high resolution mode, which is desi gned to offer high accuracy at 
small cell sizes. The instrument measured vertical profiles of the three -dimensional 
current velocity from 1.4 -1.6 m a bove the bottom to the sediment -water interface with a 
vertical resolution (bin depth) of 20 -40 mm, dependi ng on the deployment. The side -
lobe interference region was identified from the amplitude measurements by locating the 
point that the amplitude starts to increase due to the simultaneous side -lobe and main -
lobe returning energy (Owen, n.d.) .  This region is the bottom blanking distance, which 
extended up to nearly  10 cm from the bottom and was excluded from the data.  The 
ADCP was operated in 30 minutes burst mode with 1024 samples per ensemble at the 
rate of 2 -4 Hz.  As part of the data quality assessment, we used the data from the ADCP 
to check its coherence with the data from the ADV. The result of this comparison 
showed a high rate of correspondence in the measu red velocities.  
Both the ADV and ADCP were mounted on a single tripod, which was designed 
and constructed following manufacturer recommendations for each instrument (e.g., 
material, placement, and mounting) and to minimize hydrodynamic disturbance from all  
supports. In order to acquire longer time series, we used extra battery canisters. A  
91 
 schematic figure of the tripod used in the LH 2012 campaign is shown in Figure 38.  A 
similar tripod was constructed for the CCR experiment in 2013.

Instruments were mounted downlooking.  
4.3.4 Weather, lake temperature structure, and CTD measurements  
Environmental conditions (i.e, ambient weather conditions and the lake thermal 
structure ) were also m onitored during the campaigns. To monitor the meteorological 
forcing,  weather station was installed during each campaign to record win d speed and 
direction, air temperature, and relative humidity.  
To measure the temporal variability of the thermal structure of each lake, 
thermistor chains were moored at fixed points near the bubble plumes during the 
campaigns. Each chain consisted of different numbers of thermistors which were 
attached to a weight a t the bottom and float at the top. The types and resolutions of the 
 
92 
 thermistors used were: TR1060 (logging temperature at 0.1 Hz) for LH in 2012 and 
RBRsolo (logging temperature at 1 Hz) for CCR in 2013. The vertical spacing  between 
sensors  was arranged ac cording to the vertical temperature gradient in a way that more 
thermistors were placed in the thermocline region. The associated depths were 10, 16, 
22, 28, 34, 40, and 46 m for LH and 2.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, and 17.5 m for CCR.  
A Conductivity, Temperatu re, and Depth CTD (SeaBird SBE -19 Plus)  probe , 
sampling at 4 Hz was also used to obtain higher spatial resolution of the temperature 
profile as well as profiles of DO and conductivity.  Profiles were taken at pre -defined 
sampling stations following a regul ar schedule  throughout the field campaign . 
4.3.5 Bubble plume operation and deployment of instruments  
During each measurement campaign, we varied the diffuser flow rate to study the 
effects of the bubble plume operation and the lake response to different modes o f 
oxygenation. Table 4 lists the diffuser operations during the field campaigns.  This 
scheme provided us with oxygen fluxes over a wide range of ambient conditions.  
The locations of each of the moored instruments varied for each lake and for 
each measurement campaign. Locations of moored instruments have been pinned on 
Figure 36 and Figure 37, relevant information and schedule of the respective 
deployments are summarized in Table 4.

4. 4. Direct measurements of oxygen uptake  
4.4.1 Direct calculation of oxygen flux from profiler data  
Oxygen fluxes were calculated from  the in situ  oxygen microprofiles. Oxygen 
microprofiles were obtained approximately every 50 minutes based on the profiling 
scheme mentioned in ( 4.3.2). For each profile, JO2 was calculated using two approaches. 
Firstly , from the water -side portion using the direct me thod (Bryant et al., 2010b) :

(m).Figure 39 shows how Œ¥DBL and the other parameters were defined for a 
representative micro profile of oxygen. Second,  JO2 was estimated using the sediment -
side of the DO microprofile through an analogous equation:

is the oxygen gradient immediately below the SWI (mmol m-4). Measurements of œï 
(0.96 for CCR; 0.94 for LH) were made from sediment cores collected from both lakes 
during field sampling campaigns conducted prior t o those described in this study . 
The location of  the SWI was determined by visually examining each profile to 
identify the linear region in the DBL and the change in slope associated with the 
difference in porosity between the water column and the sediment. Standard deviations 
of the measurements at each po int in the microprofiles were also used to aid and verify  
95 
 the correct positioning of the SWI, since the standard deviation in the measurements 
should decrease as the microsensors approach the SWI.  
Because the exact location of the boundary layer thickness can be somewhat 
ambiguous to discern in the oxygen microprofiles,  we used the effective DBL approach 
proposed by J√∏rgensen and Revsbech, (1985) . This method extrapolates the oxygen 
gradient at the SWI until the DO concentration is equal to C‚àû, using this distance as Œ¥DBL 
(see Figure 35). More details  of the oxygen flux calculations can be found in Bierlein et 
al. (2015) , and a sample of the measured fluxes is shown in Figure 39.

 4.4.2 Correlation of J O2 estimates with turbulence models  
Models to predict JO2 seek to correlate D and ÔÅ§DBL with properties of the flow in 
the DBL or bulk properties of the hypolimnion. The standard boundary transfer equation 
is 
ÔÄ®ÔÄ©
2 0 olJ k C CÔÇ•ÔÄΩÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠  where kl is the transfer velocity, effectively given by D/ÔÅ§DBL. 
Hence, kl depends on both the thermodynamics (D) and flow conditions in the BBL 
(ÔÅ§DBL). Several models are available in the literature to predict kl from the molecular 
diffusivity and various flow properties of the overlaying water column.  Here, we 
consider two models, each based on different assumptions about the physical behavior of 
the DBL.  In the first type of model, film theory (Lewis and Whitman, 1924) , it is 
assumed that ambient currents and turbulence work to limit the diffusive growth of ÔÅ§DBL, 
so that ÔÅ§DBL is a constant over time scales comparable to the longest time scales of the  
turbulence.  The direct measurement presented in Section 4.4.1 is an example of this 
model , where ÔÅ§DBL is measured for each lander profile.  Predictive models relate the 
thickness of ÔÅ§DBL to the boundary layer characteristics near t he interface.  Lorke and 
Peeters, (2006)  present a synthesis of these types of models and show that the Batchelor 
length scale Lb is an appropriate scale for ÔÅ§DBL, yielding   
      ( 14 ) 
where ÔÅÆ is the viscosity of water and ÔÅ• is the eddy dissipation rate of the local 
turbulence . This leads to

 The challenge for this method is in measuring or estimating ÔÅ• near the DBL . 
For flows where th e law -of-the-wall is valid, ÔÅ• can be replaced by the shear 
velocity
*u , and hence , related to the shear stress at the interface.  For unsteady flows the 
correlation with ÔÅ• itself can be used, where epsilon should be evaluated at the top of the 
viscous sub layer, at a height equal to the local Kolmogorov length scale of the overlying 
turbulence (Lorke and Peeters, 2006) . The advantage of this latter approach is that it 
does not rely on the law -of-the-wall, which requires a fully developed, steady turbulent 
boundary layer.  
The second type of model assumes that the DBL thickness is continually growing 
and shrinking under the unsteady action of the turbulence in the boundary layer.  An 
example of this model is the film renewal model (Higbie, 1935) , where ÔÅ§DBL grows 
following molecular diffusion into a quiescent ambient until a turbulent  eddy penetrates 
the DBL and removes all the fluid, replacing it with fluid with concentration equal to CÔÇ•, 
after which mole cular diffusion resumes into the refreshed water.  The effective 
boundary layer thickness is found from the time average flux over each refreshment 
cycle, and  kl is given by

        ( 16 ) 
where tr is the time scale of a refreshment cycle.  The challenge in this model is in 
estimating tr.  
98 
 Theoretical models for tr relate the refreshment rate to different time scales of the 
local, overlying turbulence.  In the small eddy model, it is assumed that eddi es at the 
Kolmogorov scale (with tk = (ÔÅÆ / ÔÅ• )0.5) are responsible for refreshing the DBL, leading to

This model has the same power -law dependence in D, ÔÅ•,

Peeters  (2006)  model; hence, they assume the same underlying physical processes. In the 
large eddy model, it is assumed that eddies with the large eddy turn -over time  scale are 
responsible f or refreshing the interface.  One estimate of the large eddy turn -over time

This result has a different power -law dependen ce and D and ÔÅ• and does not include

hence, it hypothesizes a fundamentally different physical process than the Lorke and 
Peeters  (2006)  and small eddy model. The turbulent kinetic energy 
TKEk relate s to the 
energy input from the overall large -scale flow, and should be measured or estimated 
from numerical simulations.  Both the Lorke and Peeters  (2006)  and the small eddy 
model propose the same functional relationship, but with a different leading coefficient.  
99 
 Hence, these methods are ident ical. Lorke and Peeters  (2006)  compare their model to a

  Using the daily averaged fluxes measured by the lander as described in 4.4.1 , 
we can calculate the corresponding film renewal frequency (time scales of the renewal)

The renewal times in Table 5 range from 112 seconds to 4.27 hours. These times 
are quite long, and are consistent with fact that l ake bottoms are generally low -energy, 
affected by a wide range of scales of m otion. In the  following section , we present 
measurements of the different time scales that existed in these lakes during the 
measurement campaigns using the hydrodynamic measurements to understand whether 
the renewal time scales can be predicted from specific events in  the hydrodynamic data.   
101 
 Specifically, we present results for the turbulence characteristics of the BBL currents, 
internal motions, and the time -average boundary layer velocity profiles.

An important parameter for the boundary exchange models in Section 4.4.2 is the 
dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy ÔÅ•.  We estimated ÔÅ• from the ADV velocity 
 
103 
 measurements using the inertial dissipation method (IDM). This technique is widely 
accepted and applied in oceanog raphic and atmospheric research  (Grant, 1962; Lorke 
and W√ºes t, 2005; Bryant et al., 2010a) . We estimated the dissipation from the inertial 
subrange of the velocity spectra, where, assuming eddies to be isotropic, the power 
spectra depends only on the wave number k (rad/m) and the rate of dissipation of 
turbulent  kinetic energy k by:  
ùê∏(ùëò)= ùõº ùúÄ23‚ÅÑùëò‚àí53‚ÅÑ [ùëö3ùë†‚àí2]     ( 19 ) 
where Œ± = 1.56 (Sreenivasan, 1995)  is the three dimensional Kolmogorov constant. 
Since the Vector (ADV ) measures three dimensional  current fluctuations at a fixed 
Eulerian point, we can calculate three one -dimensional spectra: E11 (spectra of the 
longitudinal current),  E22 (spectra of the horizontal transverse current), E33 (spectra of the 
vertical current), each given by:  
ùê∏11(ùëò1)= ùõº1 ùúÄ23‚ÅÑùëò‚àí53‚ÅÑ [ùëö3ùë†‚àí2]     ( 20 ) 
ùê∏22(ùëò1)=ùê∏33(ùëò1)= ùõº2 ùúÄ23‚ÅÑùëò‚àí53‚ÅÑ [ùëö3ùë†‚àí2]   ( 21 ) 
where ùõº1 = (18/55) Œ±,   ùõº2  = (4/3)  ùõº1.  Per (Pope, 2000) . 
To determine the longitudinal direction of the currents, we calculated the average 
velocity over an averaging period of 50 min, which corresponds to the measurement 
period of each oxygen profile. We accomplished this by rotatin g the velocities from the 
original frame of reference (i.e. east, north and up) into a new reference where the 
average of the transversal velocity component is zero  over the averaging period . 
Frequency domain spectra were calculated from the rotated veloci ty time series 
and then transformed to the wave number domain by invoking Taylor‚Äôs frozen  
104 
 turbulence assumption to convert statistically stationary measurements from frequency  f 
to wavenumber space ( e.g., ùëà ùúï
ùúïùë• = ùúï
ùúïùë°  and, k = 2œÄf/U,  where U is the mean longitudinal 
advection velocity over each 50 minute period ). Taylor‚Äôs hypothesis is considered valid 
when eddies have negligible change as they move past a sensor. In other words, Taylor‚Äôs 
hypothesis could be acceptable when the turbulence intensity i s small relative to the 
mean current speed.  Willis and Deardorff, (1976)  suggest criteria for the validity of 
Taylor‚Äôs hypothesis such that ùúéùë¢<0.5 U, where ùúéùë¢  is the standard deviation of the 
fluctuation current speed  
'u. We evaluated this criterion for each measurement period as 
is shown in Figure 41. 
  
Figure 41. Ratio of turbulence intensity to the mean current speed to evaluate the validity of 
Taylor‚Äôs  hypothesis  
According to this criterion, Taylor‚Äôs hypothe sis is valid more than 80% of the 
measurement time. The fraction of violation s for CCR 2013 was 21%. For Lake Hallwil 
2012, the violation happened 13% in the first period of measurements, 24% for the 
second period of measurements and 16 % for the third cam paign . The occurrence  of 
 
105 
 violations  seems to be  isolated and randomly distributed; hence, we assume these have a 
negligible influence on the estimation of time series of
ÔÅ• . 
As is shown in  Figure 42, most of the time  during the campaigns velocities are 
quite low, changing from 0 to 2 cm/s in each component. To evaluate whether the flow 
is turbulent during the measurements, we investi gate the Taylor -scale Reynolds RŒª 
number , which is a parameter that has been widely used to classify turbulent boundary 
layer flows. RŒª can be used to ensure that the turbulence levels are high enough to 
develop an inertial subrange in the velocity spectra (Bluteau et al., 2011) . RŒª is given 
by RùúÜ=ùë¢‚Ä≤1ùúÜ
ùúê  where  Œª is Taylor‚Äôs microscale, which for isotropic turbulence is defined 
as:ùúÜ= ùë¢‚Ä≤1‚àö15ùúê
ùúÄ. Saddoughi and Veeravalli, (1994)  obtained a well -defined inertial 
subrange for RŒª ‚â•600. Figure 42 shows the value of RŒª throughout our measurement 
campaigns. These data show that for CCR2013 14% of the times RŒª was smaller than 
600 and that the occurrence  was more in LH , with 45, 47, and 16 % of the times for  each 
measure ment period . Low values of RŒª occur in LH during the slack velocities generated 
by the basin -scale seiche. Turbulence is otherwise high and unsteady flows are known to 
be unstable; hence, we conclude that these lakes exhibit dominantly well -developed 
turbu lent boundary layers.   
106

The average power spectrum  E11 for CCR2013 is shown in Figure 43. This 
averaged spectrum is calculated from 50 minute segments  and then averaged over the 
full measurement period. The plot demonstrates the inertial sub -range span is almost a 
decade in frequ ency space, indicating the sampling period of the ADV is adequate to 
resolve
ÔÅ• .

 For the IDM method, t he power spectrum is multiplied by k (5/3) so that the 
resulting data are  only dependent on Œµ in the inertial subrange (Bryant  et al., 2010a) . We 
then evaluate the d issipation rate as the average of the E11k5/3 in the inertial subrange 
since, as shown by Bluteau et al., (2011) , the longitudinal velocity component is least 
affected by anisotropy of turbulence in density -stratified environments , such as lakes .  
The resulting longitudinal dissipation rates are shown in Figure 44 for the two lakes. 
Dissipation rates range  between 10-11 and 10-8 W/kg , which is a typical value for a 
freshwater lake (Lorke et al., 2003; W√ºest and Lorke, 2003) .

 4.5.2 Estimating different time scales of turbulence  
The turbulent eddy dissipation rate ÔÅ• is the only flow parameter required for the 
Lorke and Peeters, (2006)  interface exchange model.  For the film renewal model, we 
also require an  estimate of the refresh period.  
Several methods can be applied to measure the large eddy turn -over time scale .  
The f irst and simplest method is based on the Prandtl mixing layer theory, and assumes 
that the largest turbulent eddies at a point in a boundary layer are proportional to the 
distance away from the boundary, z. Laboratory turbulent boundary layer measurements 
show this behavior and lead to using the distance from the wall as an estimate for the 
integral length scale. Escudier (1966) assumed lm = ÔÅ´y where lm is the mixing length, and 
ÔÅ´ = 0.41 is Von Karman‚Äôs constant. Time scales estimated using this approach wi th 
mean advective velocity as the integral velocity scale are less than of order one minute at 
a height of z = 0.15 m above the bed, the measurement location  of the ADV, and are , 
comparable to the Kolmogorov time scale.  
Doron et al. (2001)  showed these integral length scales are associated with the 
vertical velocity fluctuations (not the horizontal velocity fluctuations) thus there can 
exist large -scale horizontal eddies (with vertical axes) whose sizes do not depend on 
elevation.  Hence, t his estimate of the large eddy turn -over time scale is a low estimate.  
The second method calculates  the integral time scale using the direct method. 
Current velocities measured by the ADV were used to derive the normalized 
autocorrelation function and its integral, the integral time scale, according to:

Integral time scales T were obtained by considering the area of the correlogram 
ÔÄ®ÔÄ©rÔÅ¥
 up to the first point where it reached the zero value.  Integral time scale is 
calculated using 5 minutes segments of the time series ( Figure  45), and the integral time 
scales obtained are less than a minute , consistent with results from mixing length theory . 
Holtappels and Lorke (2011)  calculated the autocorrelation over 5 minutes of data from 
an ADV located 1 m from bottom in a lake and reported integral time scales in the order 
of 10 seconds.  At the same time, using their reported dissipation rates, if we calculate 
the Kolmogorov time scale for the same time series, will result in around 20 seconds, 
which is twice as large as their estimated integral time scale based on the autocorrelation 
function. As the dissipation rates  decrease, the estimated Kolmogorov time scales get 
even larger which implies there are  larger integral time scales that may not be captured 
by ADV measurements , where  noise or  other deterministic events are interfering.  This 
leads us to use a different th eory, based on the dissipation rate and calculate the large 
eddy turnover size and compute the time that largest eddies last.   
111 
  
Figure 45. Autocorrelation coefficient calculated as a function of the time interval  
Because of the ver y low ÔÅ•, suggesting the possibility of long, large eddy turn -over time 
scales we applied a third method to estimate the large eddy turn -over time scale that does 
not require long time series of very low -noise data.  This third method is based on the 
analyt ical formulas for estimating the large eddy turn -over times based on the  dissipation 
rates. By definition,

large eddy turn -over length  scale may be estimated in terms of Q and ùúÄ as  ùúÄ= ùê¥ùëÑ3

energy cascade  where A is  a constant which Mellor  (1973)  found to be equal to 1/15.5 
(Asher and Pankow, 1986) ; Q is defined as the square root of twice the average turbulent 
kinetic energy, i.e.,  
ùëÑ=(ùë¢‚Ä≤2ÃÖÃÖÃÖÃÖ+ùë£‚Ä≤2ÃÖÃÖÃÖÃÖ+ùë§‚Ä≤2ÃÖÃÖÃÖÃÖÃÖ)1/2= 2 u 0     ( 24 )

 Estimates of tI from the daily average dissipation rates based on this method are 
presented in  Table 6. Theoretical time scales calculated  using dissipation data . The 
theoretical eq uations are producing rather large time scales which  were  not obtained 
from the integral time scales calculated from  velocity measurements. These estimates  are 
of similar order to the renewal rates estimated in Table 6 in section 4.4.1 based on the 
direct measurements  of JO2. Hence, these values for  the large eddy turn -over time scale 
appear consistent with the structure of the turbulence and the large eddy film renew al 
model.

 4.5.3 Thermal stratification and internal motions  
An important mechanism controlling the lake response to external forcing (e.g., 
wind, inflows, outflows, and diffuser operation) is the thermal stratification. The 
stratification inhibits vertical mixing and sustains internal waves. Imberger, (1998)  
showed that most of the momentum an d energy resulting from wind forcing is 
transferred to the basin scale internal wave motion, which becomes the primary store of 
energy available for currents and mixing in the deep lake water in the absence of 
significant inflows and outflows. While steady  diffuser operations would only weakly 
affect internal waves (e.g., through a boundary or blocking effect), changes in diffuser 
operations may contribute to internal wave motion through the resulting changes in the 
buoyancy provided by the bubble plumes. I n this section we analyze the thermistor 
chain, weather, and ADV data to understand the internal wave  conditions in these lakes 
during the measurement campaigns and to determine whether the diffuser operation had 
any effect on basin -scale motions.  
Figure 46 shows the raw thermister data versus time for both lakes at two 
thermister chain locations, one close to the diffuser and one farther away. The diffuser 
flow rate is also shown for the reference. Both lakes were strongly stratified during the 
measurements, having large temperature differences between the surface and bottom 
layers.  When the diffuser is operational, the temperature fluctuations at each thermist er 
are larger near the diffuser than farther away.  This is true throughout the water column, 
but especially in the lower thermistor sensors.  For example, the standard deviation of 
the temperature signal in the second to deepest thermister in LH (40 m dep th) is 0.13 oC  
114 
 about 30 m from the diffuser and reduced to 0.09 oC about 120 m from the diffuser when 
the diffuser is operating and was 0.11  oC at 30 m from the diffuser and 0.1 1 oC at 120 m 
from the diffuser when the diffuser was turned off. This shows th at close to the diffuser 
there is a relative increase of 15 % in temperature  variation  for LH during bubbling.  
The diffuser -induced variability close to the diffuser can also be observed in the 
coherency spectra. Figure 47 shows the coherency spectra of the temperature signal at 
9.5 m depth between the two thermister chain locations in CCR for two periods of 
constant diffuser operations (i.e operating at 51 and 0 NCMH) . Cohrence spectra were 
found for 3 hour (10800 samples) window. The spectra were computed using 75% 
overlapping windows where linear detrending and a hanning window were applied to 
each window before computing the periodogram. The coherency spectra show t hat there 
is more coherency in high frequencies when the diffuser is not operating, which 
confirms that greater variability is induced by the bubbling. This type of variability has 
been measured before in the nearfield of lake aeration plumes  (McGinnis et al., 2004)  
and results from the downward flowing dense water detrained from the bubble plumes 
and falling to a level of neutral buoyancy.

= 0 NCMH (r ight side)  
The ADV data further support s the fact that the mixing near the diffuser is more 
rigorous.  As an example, consider the dissipation rates from the first deployment in LH 
as shown in  Figure 48. Dissipation rates  were evaluated using the velocity data measured 
at the tripod close to the diffuser (30 m from the diffuser) and the data set measured at 
the tripod deployed 200 m away from the diffuser. As Figure 48 shows, the dissipation 
varied between 10-8 to   10-11 Wkg-1 and were slightly enhanced close to the oxygenation 
system w hile the diffuser was operating. W hen the diffuser  was turned off, there is no 
noticeable trend in dissipation differences between these two measurement locations.

These measures have considered local mixing near the diffuser. As a first 
approximation of the  bulk lake mixing status, we compute the empirical Lake Number 
LN. This physical index can parse out the contribution of wind as a driver  and explain the 
potential for diapycnal mixing events (Stevens and Imberger, 1996) . LN has been used to 
give an indication of the strength of the wind compared to stratification and describes the 
processes relevant to the internal mixing of lakes induced by wind for cing compared to a 
lake‚Äôs complex stratification and bathymetry . Lower values of LN demonstrate a higher 
potential for increased diapycnal mixing. We utilized the numerical code, Lake Analyzer 
 
118 
 (Read e t al., 2011) , to obtain time series data for LN from the wind, bathymetry, and 
temperature measurements.  LN is defined as:  
ùêøùëÅ= ùëÜùëá(ùëçùëí+ùëç‚Ñé)
2ùúå‚Ñéùë¢‚àó2ùê¥ùë†1/2ùëßùë£       ( 25 ) 
where Ze and Zh are the depths to the top and bottom of the metalimnion, respectively, ST 
is the Schmidt stability as defined in Read et al., (2011) , œÅh is the density in the  
hypolimnion, As  is the surface area of the lake, zv is the center of volume of the lake, and 
u* is the water friction velocity due to wind stress  on the lake surface . 
Figure 49 presents the time series of water tempera tures and LN for the two lakes  
over the field campaign . Strong stratifications in both lakes lead to L N values being 
typically high , representing low likelihood of diapycnal fluxes. Both lakes have a similar 
range of LN values, with means of order 10 and p eaks of order 100 with the greater 
variability in LH.  The lowest and highest values of LN occur in LH, with significant 
diurnal variation.  Values in CC R are more steady, or sustained; high wind speed 
averages for the first two days at CCR led to lake num bers below 10 , followed by a 
sustained period below 30 for 4 more days  when the wind ceased .  Events with values 
below 10 in LH occur for two days near the beginning of the campaign and another two 
days later, with significant periods of elevated LN (in th e range of 30 to 80) between 
them.  This suggests that LH is slightly more stable, with lower values of LN lasting for a 
shorter duration and with sustained periods of slightly higher LN between mixing events.

and LH2012 (right column)  
To study the energy and periodicity of the internal motions in each lake, we 
apply spectral analysis to isotherm or isopycnal displacements (Lemmin, 1987) . We 
calculated the isotherm -depth fluctuations for CCR2013 for the 8.3 oC and 9 oC 
isotherms by linear interpolation of the multi -depth temperature data from the thermistor 
chain records. The time trace of the calculated isotherms are presented in Figure 50.

The power spectra of the se isotherm displacements are presented in Figure 51.  
Spectral densities are computed from thermister data over the whole duration of 
deployment and averaged over periods of 50 hours. Both lakes have different dominant 
frequencies and energy l evels.  The three most important frequency peaks for each lake 
are identified in the figure.  These were 25 hr, 6 hr, and 2 hr for CCR and 12.5 hr, 5 hr, 
and 4.16 hr for LH.  These differences in frequencies result from their different 
bathymetry and therm al structure . The spectra for CCR also shows a more pronounced 
peak in the low -frequency range  around 1 cpd , suggesting that on average, there exist a 
greater  basin -scale response and a slightly higher energy level in the spectra as a whole  
than compared t o LH .

These internal motions are generated through complicated processes that 
combine the instantaneous stratification with the basin bathymetry and wind forcing.

 One way to interpret the present results is through numerical simulations (Antenucci et 
al., 2000; M√ºnnich et al., 1992) . Gwaze (2003) identified the types of waves present in 
lake Hallwil by numerically approximating the seiching periods of the first vertical first 
horizontal (V1H1) and the second vertical first horizontal (V2H1) modes using a three 
layer model and the Merian formula.  Results of their measurements revealed the 
prese nce of a dominant longitudinal V1H1 seiching mode with a period around 12 hours 
during the stratification season which is consistent with the first frequency peak 
observed from our spectra.  The 5 hour peak period observed in our spectral analysis 
likely corresponds to V2H1 transverse mode.  The appearance of this tran sverse mode 
indicates that the internal wave does not necessarily only travel along the long axis of the 
basin.  
In addition to the unsteady winds setting up internal motion, we may also expect 
an influence from unsteady operation of the diffuser.  When the  diffuser is on, it could 
setup the thermocline, and turning it off or changing the diffuser rate could trigger 
internal motion as the thermocline sets down in proportion to the flow rate change. We 
expect this effect to be more noticeable in the isotherm spectra for  CCR since the 
diffuser flow rate was progressively lowered on a daily basis during the campaign .  In 
LH, the diffuser flow rate was changed twice (on then off),  in an aperiodic way; hence 
internal wave effects would not be periodic.  
Indeed, t he spectral analysis for CCR shows a dominant peak at 25 hours, 
consistent with the period of diffuser operational changes.  To explore the source of this 
peak, in  Figure 52, we plot a comparison between the time series of the wind speed,  
123 
 isotherm elevations, and diffuser operation in CCR. Beginning mid -day on May 28, a 
significant feature of the isotherm displacement is an initial set down of the isotherms 
followed by a wave peak about every 24 hours.  This coincides with when the diffuser 
flow began to change , and also tracks the expected physics for a diffuser -initiated seiche .  
The wind forcing is also periodic, but exhibits several peaks each day  and a stable mean .  
Figure 53, for instance , shows the spectral analysis of the wind speed, and there does not 
appear to be a significant energy peak at 24 hours.  Hence, these data indic ate that the 25 
hour internal mode  in CCR may have been excited by the diffuser operation.

4.5.4 Bottom boundary layer response  
The internal wave motions result in periodic currents moving along the lake 
bottom; similar features to the isotherm displacement can be seen in the ADV velocity 
data in the BBL. Figure 54 shows the spectrum of the speed measured by the ADV in the 
BBL over the whole measurement period in CCR.  The same 25 hour peak is observed in 
the ADV data as in the isotherm displacement spectrum , along with a few other peaks, 
inclu ding a diurnal peak at 12 hours .  Thus, this internal wave mode generates periodic 
currents in the BBL  that are superposed on other periodic motions . 
 
125 
  
Figure 54. Power spectra of velocity fluctuations measured by Vector (CCR2013)  
One measure of the mixing energy of the BBL flow is the dissipation rate already 
presented for the 50 minute data in Section 4.5.1 , above.  Another measure is the 
turbulent kinetic energy.  The velocity time signals measured contain periodic motion 
and tur bulent motion. To decompose the time signal into the periodic and turbulent 
motion, we use a triple decomposition approach. To extract the periodic motion, we 
applied a low -pass filter and selected a moving average with width of 60 minutes. This 
moving ave rage was applied to the raw time series which was demeaned on a daily basis 
and produced time series that contain only the periodic motion. Turbulent kinetic energy 
was then calculated from the pure turbulent part of the flow , where the mean and 
periodic m otion was removed,  and was compared with the internal motion amplitudes to 
investigate the relationship between the existing turbulence and internal motions. The 
results are shown in Figure 55 for CCR2013. Each plot corresponds to one day of 
constant diffuser flow rate operation. The comparison shows an overall similar 
 
126 
 magnitude of  TKE of about 10-6 m2/s2 for all days. The amplitudes of the coherent 
motions (as shown in the bottom panel) show a consistent wave with 24 hour period 
superimposed with waves of shorter periods. The values of the TKE and amplitude of 
the periodic motion are also correlated, with  larger TKE corresponding to higher 
amplitudes of the periodic motion.

(CCR2013)   
The unsteady velocity in the BBL is also visible in the ADCP data. Figure 56 
shows the raw measurements from the  ADCP for CCR2013.  
 
127 
  
Figure 56. ADCP raw velocity measurements for CCR2013  
As seen in the Figure 56, velocities demonstrate an unsteady behavior switching 
between directions  consistent with the periodic motion sampled by the ADV* . We 
transform the  data to be aligned with the longitudinal flow axis on a daily basis. We 
analyze the BBL response on a daily time step. Previously, we computed the 
longitudinal axis for 50 min time series by rotating the axes so that the time average flux 
is zero in the t ransverse axes. For the daily time series analyzed here, where the 
longitudinal axis is unsteady, we apply the method of Emery and Thomson (1997). We 
rotate the data series along its principal axes on which most of the variance is associated 
with a major a xis and the remaining variance with a minor axis. Principal axes can be 
found from the principal angle by which the coordinates should be rotated. The principle 
angles Œ∏p are the angles that sum of the squares of the normal distances to the data points

To view vertical profiles of the ADCP velocity data, velocities were averaged 
over 8.53 minute bursts , which is the period of our measurements on each measurement 
cycle . As explained in the Methods section, we exclude ADCP data up to 10 cm from 
the bottom to avoid  the side -lobe interference region.  Figure 57 depicts a sample of the 
velocity profiles of the longitudinal current velocity of bottom boundary measurements 
for CCR2013 on May 28 -29. This plot shows the complete flow reversal resulting from 
the dominant 24 hr. internal wave mode. Over this period, t he currents can vary from 
slack to maximum velocity over one wave period.

4.6.1 Predictive model for J O2 in reservoir numerical models  
Figure 58 compares  the results of the daily measured oxygen fluxes (see Section 
4.4.1 ) to those  predicted by the Lorke and Peeters, (2006)  and large eddy film renewal 
model. The dissipation rate used in the Lorke and Peeters, (2006)  model was given by 
Secti on 4.4.3. In the large eddy model, the renewal time was taken from the expression 
in Section 4.5.1. In this section we make the model comparison at a daily time step. The 
renewal times estimated from the JO2 measurements and the large eddy turn -over time 
scale of the turbulence are of order 100 min and longer. Hence, each 50 min profile and 
JO2 measurement is more representative of an instantaneous measurement than an 
 
130 
 average response to the turbulence. Hence, the models would not be expected to predict 
these data. A daily step was selected to give 5 to 10 renewal cycles per data point, hence, 
expected to give results consistent with the models.

CCR2013 and b) LH2012.

 To quantify the difference between the predicted and observed fluxes, we use the 
root-mean -square deviation (RMSD):  
Table 7. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), in mmol m-2 d-1, of daily average value from 
interfacial flux models comparing to observed.

As shown in Table 7, RMSD results demonstrate a better performance of the 
large -eddy film renewal model in LH2012, while the Lorke and Peeters model performs 
better in CCR2013. However, both models seem to provi de reasonable estimates of the 
fluxes in both lakes  with RMSD in the order of 20% of the measured values .  
To test the scaling law of the Lorke and Peeters, (2006)  model, Figure 59 
presents the transfer velocities calculated directly from the JO2 measurements, 
normalized by the Schmidt number, as a function of the measu red turbulence dissipation 
rate; similarly to  Lorke and Peeters, (2006)  in their paper. Data  in CCR agree somewhat  
with the li ne representing the Lorke and Peeters model, meanwhile the agreement is 
slightly less for some of the observed transfer velocities in LH. Although the agreement 
appears less than in the Lorke and Peeters (2006)  paper , these results extend the range of 
experimental data that was presented by them  to lower values of dissipation rates; hence, 
the overall trend agrees with the model line.

In this section, we have presented the comparison results based on the daily 
averages. Figure 60 also presents the comparison results for the dissipation rates as 
measured in 50 minute s egments (left plot) and averaged over 12 hours segments (right 
plots) for CCR2013. As explained above, the 50 min data are essentially instantaneous, 
and the scatter in the left plot confirms this expectation. The data at the 12 hour average 
begin to show structure, and are converging on the daily value.

4.6.2 Effects of the diffuser operation on the J O2 
Finally, we relate the observed JO2 fluxes to the diffuser operation and its effects 
on the near -bottom turbulence. As a starting point, we consider the predictive models for 
JO2 and an ana lytical analysis of their sensitivity to changes in the bulk oxygen 
concentration and the turbulence characteristics. Both of the models are of the form   
ÔÄ®ÔÄ©2¬†O l SWI lJ k C C k CÔÇ•ÔÄΩÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄΩÔÄ≠ ÔÅÑ
     ( 27 ) 
where each model hypothesizes a different dependence of kl on the near bottom 
hydrodynamics.  
Taking the Lorke and Peeters (2006)  model first, we have the equation  
22
1/4 1()2ODJCÔÅ•
ÔÅ∞ÔÅµÔÄΩÔÄ≠ ÔÅÑ
      ( 28 ) 
 
134 
 From this expression, it is clear that JO2 is linearly proportional to 
CÔÅÑ and depends on 
ÔÅ•
to the quarter power. Hence, halving 
CÔÅÑ would reduce JO2 by half while halving 
ÔÅ•  
would reduce JO2 by (1/2)1/4, or only a factor of 84%. However, from the plots of 
dissipation rate, it is clear that there is high hour -to-hour and day -to-day variability in 
ÔÅ•
(e.g., spanning over two orders of magnitude between adjacent measurements in time) 
while 
CÔÅÑ  is much more slowly varying. If
ÔÅ• reduces by a factor of 10, then JO2 reduces 
by 56%, which is similar in sensitivity to re ducing 
CÔÅÑ by half.  
 The large eddy film renewal model is somewhat more complicated since its 
formulation depends on more than one parameter of the turbulence. Using the analytical 
model from Pope, (2000)  for the large e ddy turn over time scale and substituting into the 
large eddy film renewal model, we have  
21231=¬†O
TKECDJkÔÅ•
ÔÅ∞ÔÉ¶ÔÉ∂
ÔÉßÔÉ∑
ÔÉ∏ÔÅÑ
ÔÉ®
       ( 29 ) 
The sensitivity to 
CÔÅÑ remains linear, but the sensitivity to the turbulence 
parameters has changed. The dissipation rate now enters the equation to the 
1
2 power 
while the turbulent kinetic energy goes as the -
1
2power. From Figure 55 it is evident 
that 
TKEk can vary over about a factor of two among the measured data. It is also expected 
that 
TKEk will dec rease as 
ÔÅ•  decreases. If 
ÔÅ• decreases by an order of magnitude and 
TKEk
decreases by a factor of two, then JO2 will decrease by 55%. Hence, for both of the 
analytical models, considering the potential range of the concentration differences and  
135 
 the turbulence parameters, JO2 is equally sensitive to changes in concentration and 
turbulence.  
As a final study of the an alytical nature of the predictive equations, we also 
consider the error propagation equation for the case of the Lorke and Peeters (2006)  
model. For uncertainty in
ÔÅ• , the result ing uncertainty in JO2 is given by  
2
4O lJ kCÔÅ§ÔÅ• ÔÅ§ÔÅ•ÔÅ•ÔÅ•ÔÇ∂ ÔÅÑÔÄΩÔÇ∂
       ( 30 ) 
where 
ÔÅ§ÔÅ• is the standard deviation of the
ÔÅ•  uncertainty. Likewise, the uncertainty 
resulting from variability in 
CÔÅÑ is  
2O

       ( 31 ) 
where 
CÔÅ§ÔÅÑ  is the standard deviation of the uncertainty in 
CÔÅÑ . The error propagation 
equation weights these errors using a root mean square so that we can compare these two 
uncertainties by taking the ratio of their squares, given by

      ( 32 ) 
where
cÔÅ• and 
ccÔÅÑ are the coefficients of variation of the
ÔÅ• and 
CÔÅÑ data, respectively. If 
these data had similar statistics, then uncertainty in
ÔÅ•  would be 16 times less important 
than similar uncertainty in 
CÔÅÑ . From the measurements, 
ccÔÅÑ  is about 0.4 and 
cÔÅ• is 
between 5 to 10. Substituting into the above equation gives the ratio of uncertainties to 
be order of 1. Hence, uncertainty in JO2 originates about equally from uncertainty in 
CÔÅÑ
and in the turbulence parameters. This is in agreem ent with the direct sensitivity of JO2 to  
136 
 changes in these parameters over their measured ranges, summarized in the previous 
paragraphs. Thus, we conclude that both changes in the bulk concentration and changes 
in the turbulence properties may equally effe ct JO2. To understand the role of the diffuser 
on oxygen uptake, it remains to compare the measurements of JO2 and the concentration 
and turbulence data to changes in the diffuser operation.  
Figure 61 shows the changes in these parameters for one case at LH. The DO 
concentration is plotted together with the JO2 measurements in the upper panel of the 
figure; the corresponding dissipation rate measurements are shown in t he lower panel. 
These measurements were made 30 m outside the diffuser ring, and the diffuser operated 
at a combined flow rate of 130 Nm3/h until it was shut off on May 30 (shown as the 
vertical black line in the upper panel). The mean values of JO2 and 
ÔÅ• over the periods 
before and after turning off the diffuser are also shown in the plots for reference. The net 
change in the average JO2 shows a reduction from 11 to 7 mmol/(m2d), or a factor of 
40%. At the same time, the bulk concentration decreases from about 5 mg/l during 
bubbling to 3 mg/l shortly after turning off the diffuser. This is also a reduction of 40%, 
suggesting that the changes in JO2 may be explained by changes i n the bulk background 
concentration. The variability in the dissipation rate data shows similar spread during 
both periods, with a reduction in the mean value form about 6.10-10 to 2.10-10 W/kg. This 
is a reduction of 3 times which, for the Lorke and Peeters (2006)  model, would yield a 
reduction in JO2 of about 25%, which is the same order of magnitude as the observed 
change, suggesting that turbulence may also play a role. However, there is considerabl e 
variability in the  ‘ë data so that one might conclude that the turbulence regime is  
137 
 statistically stationary over this event. In any case, the change in the bulk concentration 
is large enough to explain the change in JO2, and must be considered a dominant  
parameter.  
To further study the effects of the diffuser operation on the turbulence, the direct 
correlation between the turbulence dissipation rates and diffuser operation is assessed 
using data from CCR, in which we have constantly changed the diffuser f low rates and 
simultaneously measured the dissipation rates. The results are shown in Figure 62 as box 
plots with the turbulent dissipation rate plotted against the di ffuser flow rate. Average 
dissipation rates range from 2.10-11 to 4.10-10 W/kg, with a mean value of 10-10 W/kg 
over the complete time series. No consistent trend is observed between dissipation rate 
and diffuser flow rate. The lowest measurements of dissi pation rate did occur when the 
diffuser was turned off, but similar low values were measured for a diffuser flow rate of 
30.6 Nm3/h. At the same time, dissipation rate both increases and decreases with 
increasing diffuser flow rate.  
Each diffuser flow rate  was maintained steady for 24 hours, and we did observe 
internal waves with about a 24 hour period that appeared to be excited by the changes in 
the diffuser operation. It is possible that the flat response in dissipation rate to the 
diffuser flow rate is a result of these internal waves maintaining a similar dynamic 
regime in the hypolimnion despite reduction in the diffuser flow rate. Thus, if the 
experiments were repeated, constant diffuser flow rates should be maintained for longer 
periods of time. Henc e, for the data from these two field campaigns, the main factor 
affecting JO2 under different diffuser operations is the resulting change in 
CÔÅÑ for  
138 
 different oxygen loadings. The background turbulence remains highly variable so that 
the effect on JO2 is similar for all diffuser operation modes.

4. 7. Summary and conclusions  
Hypolimnetic oxygenation systems , particularly bubble -plume types , are 
increasingly utilized in managed lakes to increase DO concentrations. Even so, studies 
show their operation can stimulate an increase in oxygen uptake, with a magnitude that 
is difficult to predict accurately while designing the systems. This research  has done 
field studies in two different lakes (CCR and LH) to study the effects of bubble plume 
operation along with other natural phenomenon in enhancing JO2 and has used existing 
models with the field measurements to estimate the oxygen uptake and compa re them 
with the measured values. Understanding the effects of bubble plume operation on near-
sediment mixing and oxygen concentrations and improvements in predicting sediment 
 
140 
 oxygen uptake will lead to more effective optimization of  water quality in manag ed 
lakes and reservoirs.  
Mixing conditions have been studied in the study sites using thermister, weather 
and velocity data to investigate if unsteady operation of the diffusers would contribute to 
the internal wave motion. Observations showed that changes  in bubble plume operations 
may initiate internal waves. However, these waves have negligible effect on JO2 since we 
did not observe statistical significance of correlations of model hydrodynamic 
parameters to the diffuser operation and JO2 was most clearl y affected by C bulk. Thus, 
oxygenation system operation influence s oxygen uptake through increasing DO 
concentrations in the bulk water which leads to a stronger concentration gradient across 
the SWI which in turn stimulate oxygen uptake.  This can be illus trated by the 
observations made on Lake Halwill where oxygen flux experiences 40% reduction when 
the diffuser was turned off, and simultaneous measurements showed 40% decrease in the 
bulk background concentration. Hence, 
CÔÅÑ  appears to be the dominant parameter 
affecting the flux.  Effects of bubble plumes on turbulence are shown to be limited to 
close to the diffuser and becoming weak as the distance from diffuser increases.  
Models, based either on film renewal or Batchelor length sca le analysis, have 
been used to predict JO2. We analyzed the turbulence properties and investigated 
different time scales that exist in the bottom boundary layer of these two lakes including 
the periodic signals which have been shown to be important to the boundary exchange 
(Lorke et al., 2003) , to choose the appropriate parameters to input the models. The 
values pr edicted by large -eddy film -renewal model based on the theoretical integral time  
141 
 scales and Lorke and Peeters model, scale well with the measured values. It is important 
to account for increase in ùêΩùëÇ2 as a result of diffuser operation when designing and 
operating the oxygenation systems in the managed lakes. Incorporating these interfacial 
models into hydrodynamic models of lakes will allow  lake managers to better design 
bubble plumes by predicting the  variability in  ùêΩùëÇ2 in response to oxygen systems 
operations.

 5. CONCLUSIONS  
5. 1. Summary  
The overarching purpose of this work is to advance analysis tools (i.e., coupled 
3D lake models) for both the scientific investigation of hypolimnetic oxygen dynamics 
and for the management of lakes and reservoirs using bubble plumes. At the same time, 
these findings advance our fundamental understanding of bubble plumes in crossflows, 
which is clearly applicable to a variety of environmentally sensitive problems. In 
particular, this dissertation addresses the existing gaps in current three -dimensional 
hydrodynamic reservoir models which do not account for the role of bubble plumes in 
creating mixing or inducing currents in the hypolimnion.  
In section  2, the time averaged flow field behind a bubble plume in a horizontal 
ambient current U‚àû was experimentally investigated using standard measurement 
techniques , including particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser -induced fluorescence 
(LIF). Experiments were condu cted in a glass -walled flume 35 m long by 0.9 m wide 
and 1.2 m deep. Crossflows were simulated in two ways: recirculation crossflow 
generated by a pump  and using a towed source . Air bubbles were generated using an 
aquarium airstone positioned at the center line of the flume. Different cases of ambient 
crossflow and bubble air flow rates were simulated to span a range of separation heights. 
The m ajor findings were : 
1) By comparing results from two set of independent experiments with one using a 
towed plume to si mulate crossflow and the other using recirculation crossflow  
143 
 generated by the pump, it is shown that ambient turbulence does not impact the 
results , and the analogy of a towed plume to open channel crossflow is validated . 
2) Observations  made in the wake regi on reveal  that there is no secondary bubble 
plume above the separation height and that the bubble column above this point  is 
considered to be ‚Äúexhausted‚Äù solely imparting  a vertical momentum to the fluid that 
passes through it . 
3) Trajectories of the separated plume in the wake  show deviations from the expected 
13zx
scaling of advected line puff behavior. This deviation can be attributed to the 
vertical motion that is experienced by the background f low above the separation 
height, due to the action of the exhausted plume . 
4) A simple conceptual model  based on momentum conservation  is developed to 
predict the vertical velocities imparted from the  exhausted phase of the bubble 
column. Model results were correlated with  the experimental observations and show 
fair agreement . 
Investigation of  the turbulence characteristics of a bubble plume in crossflow was 
presented in Section  3. Experiments followed the same set up as in Section   2. 
Instantaneous velocities were quantifie d using PIV over the whole flow field of the 
plume wake, utilizing 25 overlapping fields of view.  Details of data preprocessing and 
stitching the field of views were explained in this section . Turbulence intensities and 
Reynolds stress terms were obtained  from the instantaneous data. Turbulence intensities 
were found to increase with increasing the bubble flow rate  but then decrease with 
increasing the crossflow. Anisotropy in the wake is observed in the wake region and  
144 
 found to increase with increasing th e bubble flow rate and cross flow velocity. 
Investigation on the mean kinetic energy of the mean flow show that bubbles create 
mean kinetic energy in the wake region above the separated plume  which is transported 
by the crossflow into the wake . 
 Section  4 detailed  the field campaigns in Carvin‚Äôs Cove (Virginia, USA) and 
Lake Hallwil (Lu cerne, Switzerland) and presented  simultaneous measurements of 
temperature, wind, turbulence , and JO2 in the bottom boundary layer of these lakes. The 
gas flow  rates of the d iffuser were manually adjusted to the designed experiment s during 
the field campaigns. Analysis of the data showed that changing the diffuser flow  rates 
can excite internal waves leading to the generation of unsteady currents. Nevertheless, 
the dominant pa rameter affecting the sediment oxygen uptake is  likely  the change in 
oxygen concentrations induced by the diffuser operation. Existing models of interfacial 
fluxes were utilized to predict the JO2 and were then compared to the direct JO2 
measurements. Mode ls based on the large eddy film-renewal theory and the Batchelor 
scale matched  well with field observations and could be used to predict JO2. 
5. 2. Recommendations for future research  
5.2.1 Crossflow experiments in the lab  
1) An extension of the experiments in a uniform crossflow could be done with 
the use of Stereoscopic PIV approaches which permit all three components to 
be recorded. For better understanding of the interactions between bubbles and 
crossflow, discrete bubbles in the chain can be set up and studied. Using  
145 
 discrete bubble s would simplify the complexity of getting the flow field in a 
bubble column with high void fraction.  
2) The s tructure of the flow in the wake region  behind a bubble column can be 
investigated by identifying  instantaneous vortices and quantifying their  
properties. These data are important to characterize the flow structures 
generating mixing and controlling the instantaneous dilution and 
concentration fields in multiphase plumes. Turbulence spectra can be 
investigated to add insight to the turbulence properties and scales in bubble 
plumes . 
3) Numerical modeling: data from experiments presented in this study should be 
compared to the predictions from numerical models. An LES model is being 
developed with t he same setup as these experiments by the Cardiff School of 
Engineering which adopts an Eulerian - Lagrangian approach representing 
bubbles as volume -less lagrangian markers.  See Fraga et al (2015) for an 
example in a quiescent ambient . 
5.2.2 Field s tudies  
1) Variab le JO2 expression along with a model for the bubble plume system can 
be incorporated into water quality models (S uch as ELCOM -CAYDEM), 
setting JO2 to be a predicted variable rather than a fitting parameter  to predict 
the impact of the oxygenation system on  lake hydrodynamic s and JO2.
