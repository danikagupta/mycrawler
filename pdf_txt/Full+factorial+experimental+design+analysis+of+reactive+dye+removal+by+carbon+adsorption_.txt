The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of Remazol Yellow dye from aqueous solutions by adsorption on
activatedcarbonpreparedbychemicalactivationofsunflowerseedcake.Itwasfoundthatthecarboncontentofbiomassincreases
up to 65.12% after activation and carbonization processes. The maximum percentage dye removal was obtained as 82.12% with0.4g/50mLadsorbentdosageat313K.TheLangmuirmodelshowedthebestfitwithequilibriumisothermdata.Theinteractions
were evaluated with respect to both pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics. The adsorption process was
found to follow the pseudo-second-order model. To optimize the operating conditions, the effects of pH, adsorbent dosage, andinitialdyeconcentrationwereinvestigatedbyfullfactorialexperimentaldesignmethod;adsorbentdosagewasfoundasthemostsignificant factor with𝑃=0.02 lower than 95% confidence level. The obtained results are very promising since (i) the utilization

1. Introduction
Rapidly changing technologies, industrial products, and
applications are causing worldwide waste problem and con-taminating the environment. If waste products are improp-erly managed, public health and the environment could bethreatened[ 1,2]. Among all industrial sectors, textile indus-
triesareratedashighpolluters,takingintoconsiderationthevolumeofdischargeandeffluentcomposition[ 1,3].Globally,
thousands of the dye stuffs are being synthesized daily andalsobeingreleasedintheenvironmentintheformofeffluentsduring synthesis and dyeing processes [ 4]. Most of the dyes

2),nitrogenoxides,and
hydrogen chlorides, and can reduce light penetration and
photosynthesis[ 5].
Currently, synthetic dyes are largely used in many fields,
for example, in various branches of the textile industry, inleather tanning industry, in paper production, in food tech-nology, in agricultural research, in light-harvesting arrays,in photoelectrochemical cells, and in hair colorings [ 6–15].
The wastewater from textile and dyestuff industries is char-acterized by high alkalinity, biological oxidation demand,chemical oxidation demand, and total dissolved solids with
dyeconcentrationsgenerallybelow1g/dm
3[16,17].Reactive
dyes are the most common dyes used due to their favorablecharacteristicsofbrightcolor,waterfastness,simpleapplica-tiontechniques,andlowenergyconsumption.Theyexhibitawide range of different chemical structures, primarily basedonsubstitutedaromaticandheterocyclicgroups[ 18,19].They
arenoteasilybiodegradable;thus,thecolormayremainintheeffluentevenafterextensivetreatment[ 18,20].
Dyewastewaterisusuallytreatedbyphysicalorchemical
treatment processes. These include flocculation combinedwithflotation,electroflocculation,membranefiltration,elec-trokinetic coagulation, electrochemical destruction, ion-exchange, irradiation, adsorption, precipitation, ozonation,and katox treatment methods involving the use of activatedcarbon and air mixtures. However, these technologies aregenerally unsuccessful in color removal, expensive, and less

adaptabletoawiderangeofdyewastewaters[ 16,21].Thelow
cost, simple design, easy handling, and sludge-free cleaningoperationshaveestablishedtheadsorptiontechniqueasmoreeffective and convenient in comparison to other techniques[1,22].
Adsorption now plays a key role in modern industries,
mainlyinthefieldofenvironmentalprotectionengineering,
with the increasing environmental consciousness of peopleallovertheworld.Adsorptionprocessesarebeingemployedwidely for large-scale biochemical, chemical, and environ-mentalrecovery and purificationapplications[ 23]. Over the
lastfewdecades,adsorptionhasbeenrecognizedasaninflu-entialseparationprocessandhasbecomeanattractiveoptionfortheremovalofdyesfromindustrialeffluents[ 24].Adsor-
bents are used in various processes; activated carbons areamong the most effective adsorbents because of their excel-lentadsorptioncapacityfororganictargets[ 24].Manystudies
havebeenundertakentoinvestigatetheuseoflow-costadsor-bents such as peat, bentonite, steel-plant slag, fly ash, chinaclay, maize cob, wood shavings, silica [ 16,25–27], bacterial
biomass and biopolymers [ 22,28], coir pith [ 20], sugar beet
pulp[29],sugarcanebagassepith[ 30],jutefiber[ 19,31],hen

Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is one of the foremost
oil seed crops cultivated for the production of cookingoil [36]. The total world production of 38 million tons of
sunflower seed, grown on about 25 million hectares [ 37], go
almost exclusively to oil extraction, providing 8.2% of totalworldvolume,estimatedataround107milliontones[ 38,39].
InTurkey,sunflowerisgrownintheThrace,theAegean,andthe Black Sea regions for oil production; thus, Turkey is oneof the major sunflower producers and exporter countries.Oil extraction from the seeds is accompanied by the copro-duction of lignocellulosic biomass, in the form of sunflowerseedhulls,whichcomprise30%ofthesunflowerseeds.Theseresiduesareusuallydisposedofbyburningorbydepositioninlandfills,butconversiontohigher-valueproductswouldbepreferable.Onesuchproductcouldbeactivatedcarbon[ 36].
No information is available on Remazol Yellow removal
from aqueous solution by sunflower biomass in the litera-ture. This low-cost material may be especially suitable forvarious applications in developing countries and small-scaleindustries. Consequently, the scope of this study was notonly to produce chemically activated sunflower seeds as analternativelow-costadsorbentforremovalofRemazolYellowd y ef r o ma q u e o u ss o l u t i o n s ,b u ta l s ot oc h a r a c t e r i z ei ta n dto investigate the effects of operating parameters such assolution pH, adsorbent dosage, initial dye concentration,temperature,contacttime,andelectrolytesused.EquilibriumisothermdatawerefittedtoLangmuirandFreundlichequa-
tions and constants of isotherm equations were determined.
Furthermore, pseudo-first and second-order kinetic modelswere also used to analyze adsorption kinetics. Finally, themost effective parameter (pH, adsorbent dosage, and initialdyeconcentration)intheadsorptionprocessfordyeremovalwas defined by using Full Factorial Design method and
analysisofvariance(ANOVA)statisticalapproach.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Preparation of Sunflower Seed Cake Adsorbent and Aque-ousDyeSolutions. Sunflowerseedcake(SSC)obtainedfrom
Central Anatolia region of Turkey was air dried, crushed,and sieved to obtain mean sizes. Bulk density of chosen size
was calculated about 0.47g/cm

reducedparticlesizewasmodifiedbyimpregnationwith50%wt NH
4Cl solution and dried at 100∘Ci na no v e n .C h e m i c a l
treatment with NH4Cl was applied to help break down the
lignin complex in order to improve the performance of theadsorbent. Modified biomass material was then carbonizedat 350

Finally, sieved biomass and dried sunflowerseed cake activated carbon (SSCAC) were stored in plasticbottlesforfurtheruse.
ReactivetextiledyeRemazolYellow(RY)wasusedwith-
outpurification.Dyesolutionswerepreparedusingdistilled
water to prevent and minimize possible interferences. Stocksolution of dye was prepared by dissolving 1.0g of RY dye in1000 mL of distilled water. By diluting the standard solutionofdye,differentworkingconcentrations(50–250mg/L)werearranged.
2.2. Methodologies Used for Low Temperature Activated Car-
bon Characterization. Different characterization techniques
havebeenusedtoidentifytheproducedactivatedcarbonandthe main constituents of the sunflower seed cake activatedcarbon. This will now be discussed. The ultimate analysis ofSSC and SSCAC was performed using Elemental Analyzer
(Leco CNH628 S628) to find carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen,
and oxygen contents of materials by using helium, dry air,and oxygen gases. The complete combustion of all organicsamples was carried out by operating Elemental Analyzer’sfurnace at 950
∘C. Structure and preliminary analyses were
carriedouttocompletetheproximateanalysisofSSC.Func-tional groups of SSC and SSCAC were estimated by Fouriertransforminfrared(FTIR)spectroscopy(PerkinElmerSpec-trum 100). The FT-IR spectrums of SSC and SSCAC wereobtainedusingtheATRtechnique(withadiamondprotectedAttenuated Total Reflectance crystal unit) with a resolution
of 4cm
−1after 100 scans. Surface morphologies of SSC and
SSCAC were observed by employing a scanning electronmicroscope(ZeissSupraVP40)withanacceleratingvoltageof 5kV. The samples were sputter-coated with platinum(QuorumQ150RESDCSputter).
2.3.BatchAdsorptionStudies. Theeffectsofimportantpara-
meters such as pH, adsorbent dosage, initial dye concen-tration, temperature, contact time, and electrolyte on theadsorptionofRemazolYellowwerestudied.Batchadsorptionexperiments were conducted in a set of conical flasks con-taining 50mL dye solution of different operating conditionsuntiltheequilibriumwasreached.ThesuspensionswerethenJournalofChemistry 3

2.4. Kinetic and Isotherm Models. Interaction of adsorbate
with the adsorbent materials is indicated by the adsorption
isotherm. It is important to establish the most appropriate
correlations for the equilibrium data of the system for opti-mizing the design of adsorption process to remove RY dye.The experimental data of RY dye was analyzed using linearLangmuirandFreundlichisothermmodelstoinvestigatetheeffect of temperature on the equilibriumcapacity of SSCAC.Linear regression is generally used to find which isotherm
is best fitted, and also the correlation coefficients of 𝑅

evaluatedtocomparethepracticalityofisothermequation.
The Langmuir isotherm assumes monolayer adsorption
ontoasurfacecontainingafinitenumberofidenticaladsorp-tionsites[ 40].Langmuirtheoryisbasedontwoassumptions
that the adsorbed layer is unimolecular and the forces ofinteraction between sorbed molecules are negligible [ 36].

adsorption intensity. The intercept 𝐾𝐹and the slope1/𝑛are
obtainedbyplottingln𝑞𝑒versusln𝐶𝑒.
ToilluminatethepossiblemechanismofRYdyeadsorp-
tion process, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
kinetic models were tested by using the data obtained fromadsorptionkineticexperiments.
The pseudo-first-order kinetic model of Lagergren is

andtheinterceptof(log𝑞𝑒)areobtained.
The pseudo-second-order model estimates the behavior
over the whole range adsorption [ 18] and this model is
also based on the adsorption capacity of the solid phase.The pseudo-second-order model has a supposition that thesorption process involves chemisorption mechanism and is
definedas[ 38]

2.5.FullFactorialDesignofExperiments. Previouslyplanned
experimental design, which examines all factors at once,has been used widely instead of conventional experimentaldesign,whichinvestigateseveryvariablebychangingonebyone. Optimum conditions are decided by changing severalfactors at once and using different levels of these factors.Factorial designs are widely applied in the experiments thatare taking into account several factors where it is necessary
to study the interaction effect of factors on the response
[45].2
𝑛factorial design of experiments needs less number
of experiments for several factors; thus, materials and timeused are slightly reduced [ 46,47]. When factorial design
methods applied to experiments of a process, mathematicalmodelsarederivedthroughobtainedvarianceanalysistables.If the model is seen insufficient, it can be varied and newexperiments are prepared until the most appropriate modelis achieved. Experiments are chosen randomly to preventpartialityofresearchers.
The factorial design describes which factor shows more
impact and influences the variation of one factor on theother factors [ 48]. The three factors pH, adsorbent dosage,4 JournalofChemistry

3.1.3. Morphological Characterization (SEM). The physical
morphologies and surface properties of the sunflower seed
cakeandactivatedcarbonpreparedbychemicallyactivationandlowtemperaturecarbonizationmethodswereexaminedby using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique.Figure2shows the textural structure investigation of SSC
and SSCAC particles from SEM micrograph at 500x and5000x magnification, respectively. It can be concluded thatSEM images of SSC and SSCAC showed severe differences.SSC had a rough surface, and thick wall structure causeda little porosity. Chemical activation and low temperaturecarbonization methods led opening of thick wall; thus, sur-face of SSCAC contained more pores than SSC surface andthisresultsinhighersurfacearea.

temperature, and amount of SSCAC were fixed at 100mg/L,60min, 293K, and 0.10g/50mL, respectively. The effectof pH on adsorption of dye was studied within pH range2–8. The pH was adjusted by adding a small amount of0.1M HCl and/or 0.1M NaOH; adjusted pH was measuredusing pH meter (Thermo Scientific Orion 3 Star). After60min equilibrationat variouspH values illustrated that thepercentage adsorption decreased from 22.70% to 7.09% forRY removal when pH increased from 2 to 8 (see Figure3);

The favorable adsorptionof thedye at relativelylow pHs
in the range of 1.0–5.0 may be attributed to the electrostaticinteractions, since at lower solution pH, the SSCAC may getpositively charged, which enhances the negatively chargedreactive dye anions through electrostatic forces of attractionand hence increase the adsorption capacity [ 38]. Also, this
behavior of dye is in accordance with the known fact thattheadsorptiondecreaseswithincreasingpHforanionicdyes(astheRemazolYellowinthepresentcase),whileitincreaseswithincreasingpHforcationicdyes[ 6].

However, the increase in the adsorbent dosage provided a
remarkable decrease in the amount of dye uptake per gramof adsorbent(𝑞
𝑒). This could be explained with two factors.
First, the increase in adsorbent mass at fixed dye concentra-tionandvolumewillleadtounsaturationofadsorptionsitesthroughtheadsorptionprocess,and,second,thereductioninadsorbentcapacityislikelytobeduetoparticleaggregation,resultingfromhighadsorbentmass.Suchaggregationwouldlead to a decrease in total surface area of the adsorbenta n da ni n c r e a s ei nd i ff u s i o n a lp a t hl e n g t h[ 49].

3.2.3. Effect of Initial Dye Concentration on SSCAC Adsorp-

by varying initial dye concentration from 50 to 250mg/Lfor 0.4g/50mL adsorbent dosage. It has been known thatincreasingtheinitialdyeconcentrationresultsinanincreaseintheadsorptioncapacitybecausetheinitialdyeconcentra-tionprovidesadrivingforcetoovercomemasstransferresist-ances between the adsorbent and adsorption media [ 44].

initial dye concentration, the number of molecules compet-ing for the available sites on the surface of activated carbonwashigh,hence,resultinginhigherRYadsorptioncapacities.In the case of lower concentrations, the ratio of dye tothe available sorption sites was low and higher adsorptionyields were obtained. The adsorption percentage was foundtodecreasewithincreasedyeconcentration.Thismaybeduetothesaturationofsurfaceareaandactivesitesofadsorbent[41]. When 0.1g adsorbent dosage was used, the adsorption

3.2.4. Effect of Contact Time and Temperature on SSCAC
Adsorption. The adsorption of RY on SSCAC at different
temperatures was studied as a function of contact time (20–120min)inordertodeterminetheequilibriumtime;experi-mentswereconductedat293,303,and313Kinanisothermalwater bath shaker with initial dye concentration of 100mg/Landrotationspeedof120rpm.Arapidadsorptioncanbeseenattheinitialstageofthecontactperiod.Thisismostlikelydueto a large number of surface sites for adsorption. However,it gradually slowed down until it reached equilibrium. Aftera lapse of time, the remaining surface sites are difficult tobe occupied because of the repulsion between the solutemolecules of the solid and bulk phases. Thus, adsorptiontook long time to reach equilibrium [ 18]. At the point of
dye removal reached a constant value where no more dyewas removed from the solution. The amount of dye beingadsorbed onto the adsorbent was in a state of dynamic equi-libriumwiththeamountofdyedesorbedfromtheadsorbent.
Thetimerequiredforthisstateofequilibriumwascalledthe

indicatedthatthecontacttimeisneededforRYsolutionwithinitial concentration of 100mg/L to reach equilibrium was100min (see Figure6). The maximum percentage removal

3.2.5. Effect of Electrolytes on SSCAC Adsorption. Reactive
dyes are the major cause for complaint. Exhaust reactivedyeing required high salt concentration (up to 80g/L ofNa
2SO4/NaCl); salt is added to shift the equilibrium of dye

effectsofdifferentelectrolytes(NaNO3,NaCl,NH4NO3,and
CaCl2⋅2H2O) on the adsorption kinetics were investigated
and shown in Figure7.I tw a sa l s oc o n v e n i e n tt os t u d y
the effect of various salt concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and0.2M) on the adsorption behavior. Electrolyte effect experi-ments were carried out with 100mg/L RY solutions at 293Kand pH of 2. It was found that the addition of theseelectrolytes to dye solution increased the percentage dyeremovalandadsorptioncapacity.Thecolorremovalwasalsodependentontheconcentrationofaddedelectrolytes.WhenCaCl

Accordingto Table 3,thehighestcorrelationcoefficients( 𝑅2
values) were obtained from Langmuir equation; thus, the
Langmuir model displayed better fit to the adsorption datathan the Freundlich model. This result indicated that thesurfaceofSSCACforadsorptionofRYwasmadeupofhomo-geneousadsorptionpatches.
3.3.2. Adsorption Kinetic Models. Reactive RY dye was
adsorbed onto SSCAC with different adsorbent dosages (0.1and 0.4g/50mL) for different time intervals and obtainedexperimental data were investigated to have a good agree-ment between pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-orderm o d e l s .Th ea d s o r p t i o nr a t ec o n s t a n t s( 𝑘

Adsorptioncapacities were increased by raising temperature. This ten-dencyprovedthattheadsorptionoccurredendothermically.
3.4. Full Factorial Design of Experiments. Dye removal by
an adsorbent in a batch system usually depends on severalfactors.Theseareacidityofmedium(pH),adsorbentdosage,initial dye concentration, contact time, temperature, and so
f o r t h .O n l yo n ef a c t o ri sv a r i e db yt i m ea n dt h eo t h e r s
are fixed when any factor is optimized; subsequently, thebest value obtained by this procedure is fixed and otherfactors will be varied by the time; thus, using the univariateprocedure to optimize all variables is very time consuming.The interactions among all the factors are neglected in uni-variateprocedure,sothebestconditioncouldnotbeachieved[53]. Full factorial design of experiments was performed by
practicing with different levels of factors’ all probable com-binations [ 54]. The results of the experimental design were
analyzed using MINITAB 14 statistical software to evaluatet h ee ff e c t sa sw e l la st h es t a t i s t i c a lp a r a m e t e r s ,t h es t a t i s t i c a lplots (Pareto, normal probability of the standardized effects,main effects, and interaction plots). 2

having 8 experiments for RY removal was studied, and amatrixwasestablishedaccordingtotheirhighandlowlevels,represented by +1 and−1, respectively. The coded values
of variables with the responses (% removal efficiency) wereillustrated in Table 5. The interactions between independent
factorsweredeterminedwithanalysisofvariance(ANOVA)

The following codified equation was used to explain the

factors (pH, adsorbent dosage, and initial dye concentra-tion) and their interactions(𝐴𝐵)were significant at a 5%
of probability level (𝑃<0.05 ). When the factor effect is
negative,removalefficiencydecreasesasthefactorischangedfromlowtohighlevels(asseenfrompHandinitialdyecon-centration).Incontrast,iftheeffectsarepositive,removaleffi-ciencyincreasesforhighlevelofthesamefactor(asseenfromadsorbent dosage). Furthermore, the fit models, submitted

the primary factor of interest in the experiment [ 55]. It was
concludedthatthelargertheverticallineis(see Figure8(a) ),

Equation ( 8) indicated that two-variable interactions
were significant. Proof of large positive ( 𝐴𝐶) and negative
(𝐴𝐵and𝐵𝐶) interactions was quite intense, thus, could not
be ignored from the model. Although the main effects gavea clear idea, the interaction between those two parameterswould favor a better statement of the process. Figure8(b)JournalofChemistry 9

It can be concluded that the adsorbent dosage was
the strongest effect of the overall adsorption procedure ofSSCAC.The𝑋2coefficientwasthelargestnegativecoefficient
for model equation ( 8). The positive value of its coefficient
meantthatRYremovalbySSCACwaspreferredatadsorbentdosage of 8g/L. An increase of adsorbent dosage caused anuptrend in the percentage removal of RY dye, since risingadsorbentdosageprovidedasuitablesurfaceareaforadsorp-tion.Thesecondimportantfactortotheoveralloptimizationof the batch adsorption process was pH. The increase in thepH involved a striking decrease of RY uptake by SSCAC.The third important factor was the initial dye concentrationof dye. Surface area and active sites of SSCAC may besaturated at higher concentrations; thus, removal efficiency(%)decreasedwithraisingtheinitialdyeconcentration.Theinteractionoftwofactors𝐴𝐵wasthefourthsignificantfactor.

4. Conclusions
Green carbon produced by chemical activation of sunflowerseed cake with an activation agent 50% NH
4Cl was capable
of removing reactive Remazol Yellow dye molecules fromaqueous solutions. The adsorption was favored at acidicmedium with pH value 2 and adsorption efficiency (%) wasalsofoundtoincreasewiththeincreaseinadsorbentdosage,contact time, temperature, and addition of electrolyte. Thekinetic study showed that dye-activated carbon adsorptionsystems followed by pseudo-second-order model with highcorrelationcoefficientsandtheprocesswasendothermic.Theequilibrium data was in good agreement with the Langmuirmodel and dimensionless separation factors ( 𝑅
𝐿values)
within the range of zero to one showed that the adsorptionwasfavorable.Additionally,theinfluenceofpH(2–8),adsor-bent dosage (2–8g/L), and initial dye concentration (100–250mg/L) on removal efficiency (%) was designed by using
2
3full factorial design. It was examined by using analysis of
variance (ANOVA),𝑡-test, and𝐹-test. According to Pareto
Chart, normal probability plot, main effects, and interactionplots in variance analysis, the most significant factors onremoval efficiency (%) were found to be adsorbent dosage(𝐵), pH (𝐴), initial dye concentration (𝐶), and the interac-
tion between pH and adsorbent dosage ( 𝐴𝐵), respectively.
Conversely, the other interactions were not effective on RYadsorption.Duetotheobtainedresults,greencarbonwhichisproducedfromchemicalactivationofsunflowerseedcakecould be employed as an effective and low-cost adsorbent.Therefore, this successful adsorbent could be considered asanalternatetocommercialactivatedcarbonsfortheremoval
