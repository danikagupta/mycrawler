The pollutants classiﬁed as “persistent organic pollutants (POPs) ”, are being subject to high
concern among the scientiﬁc community due to their persistence in the environment.TiO
2-based photocatalytic process has shown a great potential as a low-cost, environ-
mentally friendly and sustainable treatment technology to remove POPs in sewage to
overcome the shortcomings of the conventional technologies. However, this technologysuffers from some main technical barriers that impede its commercialization, i.e., theinefﬁcient exploitation of visible light, low adsorption capacity for hydrophobic contami-nants, uniform distribution in aqueous suspension and post-recovery of the TiO
2particles
after water treatment. To improve the photocatalytic efﬁciency of TiO 2, many studies have
been carried out with the aim of eliminating the limitations mentioned above. This reviewsummarizes the recently developed countermeasures for improving the performance ofTiO
2-based photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants with respect to the visible-
light photocatalytic activity, adsorption capacity, stability and separability. The perfor-mance of various TiO
2-based photocatalytic processes for POPs degradation and the un-
derlying mechanisms were summarized and discussed. The future research needs for
TiO 2-based technology are suggested accordingly. This review will signiﬁcantly improve
our understanding of the process of photocatalytic degradation of POPs by TiO 2-based
particles and provide useful information to scientists and engineers who work in this ﬁeld.

1. Introduction
In recent times, the world faces enormous challenges aheadas drinkable water runs short due to natural disasters, popu-lation increase, and water pollution. In view to suppress theworsening of clean water shortage, the possible reuse ofonsite rural wastewater or treated municipal wastewater fromtreatment plants for agricultural and industrial activities may
be the best solution for the future of sustainable water man-
agement in water-deprived countries ( Lapena et al., 1995;
Bradley et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2012 ). Since these wastewaters
constitute one of the largest possible water resources, theirreuse is anticipated to offset more clean water resource.
Recycling wastewaters is usually associated with the
presence of suspended solids, health-threat coliforms and theso-called persistent organic pollutants (POPs, e.g., pharma-ceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disrupters)that are both tedious and expensive to treat ( Viessman and
Hammer, 1998; Miranda-Garcia et al., 2011; Zeng et al.,
2013a,b ). In particular, the POPs are frequently detected in
treated sewage, surface and groundwater and even drinkingwater, and have been observed to be capable of long-rangetransport, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, bio-magnify in food chains, and to have potential signiﬁcant im-pacts on human health and the environment ( Miranda-Garcia
et al., 2011 ). Development of advanced water treatment
technologies with low-cost and high efﬁciency to treat thePOPs contaminated wastewater is desirable. Currently, avail-able water treatment technologies such as adsorption orcoagulation merely concentrate the pollutants present by
transferring them to other phases, but they are not completely
“eliminated ”or“destroyed ”(Padmanabhan et al., 2006 ). Other
conventional water treatment methods such as sedimenta-tion, ﬁltration, chemical oxidation and biotechnology sufferfrom some disadvantages such as incomplete removal, high
consumption of chemical reagent, high treatment cost, time-consuming and generation of toxic secondary pollutants ( H.R.
Dong et al., 2011; Oller et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2014 ). Effective
alternative water treatment technologies are therefore
required to improve treated efﬂuent quality.
Photodegradation process of POPs has attracted increasing
attention during the past decades due to its effectiveness inrapidly degrading and mineralizing recalcitrant organic com-pounds ( Legrini et al., 1993; Chong et al., 2010; Miranda-Garcia
et al., 2011 ). Various photocatalysts including CdS, SnO
2,W O 3,
SiO 2, ZnO, Nb 2O3,F e 2O3were being studied but the nano-TiO 2
photocatalyst is well-known among the metal oxides for itshigh efﬁciency, low cost, physical and chemical stability,widespread availability, and noncorrosive property ( Carp et al.,
2004; Herrmann et al., 2007 ). It can be used to degrade a variety
of organic and inorganic pollutants. When nano-TiO
2is irra-
diated with ultraviolet (UV) light, electrons are promoted fromthe valence band to the conduction band, resulting in thegeneration of energized “holes ”in the former ( Fujishima et al.,
2000; Chong et al., 2010 ). Free electrons react with the oxygen to
form superoxide radical anions (O
2/C15/C0), while energized holes
react with water (H 2O) or hydroxyl ion (OH/C0) to form hydroxyl
radicals (/C15OH). To date, the main TiO 2applications are focused
on air puriﬁcation ( Ao and Lee, 2003; Zhao and Yang, 2003; Li
et al., 2005a,b ). Studies in wastewater treatment by TiO 2are
still mainly in the stage of laboratory experiments because of
some technical barriers. Firstly, the widespread technological
use of TiO 2is to some extent constrained by its wide band gap
(anatase, ~3.2 eV), which requires ultraviolet irradiation forphotocatalytic activation, giving rise to a very low energy efﬁ-ciency in utilizing solar light ( Yin et al., 2003; Zaleska, 2008;
Chong et al., 2010 ). Because UV light accounts for only a small
fraction (5%) of the sun 's energy compared to visible light (45%),
the shift in the optical response of TiO
2from the UV to thewater research 79 (2015) 128 e146 129visible spectral range will have a profound positive effect on
the practical applications of the material. Besides the inefﬁ-
cient exploitation of visible light, the practical applicationswere also prohibited due to the following limitations: 1) lowadsorption capacity to hydrophobic contaminants; 2) high ag-gregation tendency; and 3) difﬁculty of separation and recovery(Bhattacharyya et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2013 ).
To improve the photocatalytic efﬁciency of TiO
2, many
studies have been carried out to eliminate the limitationsmentioned above. Although some review papers on TiO
2
technologies have been published in recent years, most ofthem focused on contaminants removal, the reaction mech-
anisms, preparation methods of TiO
2-based particles, princi-
ples of photocatalysis, and effects of operational parameters(Gaya and Abdullah, 2008; Zaleska, 2008; Chong et al., 2010;
Lim et al., 2011; Morales-Torres et al., 2012; Pelaez et al.,2012 ). None of them extensively summarizes the limitations
of TiO
2-based technologies and the developed countermea-
sures in the past years. Therefore, this paper aims to reviewand summarize the limitations of TiO
2technologies and the
recent works on the modiﬁcation of TiO 2photocatalysts with
the purpose of improving the photocatalytic degradation oforganic pollutants. The existing shortcomings and future
research needs to utilize TiO
2photocatalysis for water treat-
ment are also summarized and discussed.
2. Basic principle of TiO 2photocatalysis
The semiconductor TiO 2has been widely utilized as a photo-
catalyst for inducing a series of reductive and oxidative re-actions on its surface. The mechanisms underlying theheterogenous photocatalysis employing the semiconductorTiO
2catalyst have been intensively reported in many papers
(Fujishima et al., 2000; Gaya and Abdullah, 2008; Banerjee
et al., 2014 ). Generally, there are ﬁve essential key steps in
the heterogenous photocatalysis on the surface of TiO 2,
namely, the (1) photoexcitation (light absorption and charge-carriers generation), (2) diffusion, (3) trapping, (4) recombina-tion, and (5) oxidation ( Gaya and Abdullah, 2008; Chong et al.,
2010; Foo and Hameed, 2010 ). The key reactions involved in
the photocatalysis are listed in Table 1 . Upon irradiation of
TiO
2with light energy equivalent to or greater than its band
gap energy (anatase, ~3.2 eV), the electron is excited from thevalence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). Fig. 1 depicts
the mechanism of the electron ehole pair formation when the
TiO 2particle is irradiated with light of adequate energy. The
light wavelength for such photon energy usually correspondstol<400 nm. The photonic excitation leaves behind an empty
unﬁlled valence band, and thus generates the electron ehole
pair (e
/C0ehþ)(Eqs. (2.1) e(2.3)).
The e/C0
TRand hþ
TRinEq. (2.4) represent the surface trapped
valence band electron and conduction-band hole respectively.It was reported that these surface-trapped electrons and holesrecombine much more slowly than they do in the bulk ( Furube
et al., 2001 ).Serpone et al. (1995) have highlighted the impor-
tant consequences of surface trapped holes (h
þ
TR) and elec-
trons (e/C0
TR) to the photooxidation of organic compounds. In
the absence of electron scavengers ( Eq. (2.4) ), the photoexcited
electron recombines with the valence band hole in nanosec-onds with simultaneous dissipation of heat energy. Hence, thepresence of electron scavengers is vital for prolonging therecombination and successful functioning of photocatalysis.
In most applications, photocatalytic degradation reactions
are carried out in presence of water, air, the target contami-nant and the photocatalyst. Generally, the positive hole reactswith the surface OH
/C0groups on the TiO 2particle to produce
surface adsorbed hydroxyl radical (/C15OH ads)(Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) )
depicts how the presence of oxygen prevents the recombi-nation of electron ehole pair, while allowing the formation of
superoxide radical anion (O
2/C15/C0). This O 2/C15/C0radical can be further
protonated to form the hydroperoxyl radical (HO 2/C15) and sub-
sequently H 2O2(Eqs. (2.7) e(2.9)). The HO 2/C15radical formed was
also reported to have scavenging property and thus, the co-existence of these radical species can doubly prolong therecombination time of the h
þ
TRin the entire photocatalysis
reaction. Photogenerated holes and the formed reactive oxy-gen species (e.g.,
/C15OH) can participate in the degradation of
organic pollutants ( Fujishima et al., 2000; Zhao and Yang,
2003; Banerjee et al., 2014 )(Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11) ).
Since the heterogenous photocatalysis reaction mostly
occurs on the photon activated surface of TiO 2, the under-
standing of the reaction steps involved in the photo-degradation of organics is essential in the formulation ofkinetic expressions. With increasing irradiation time, theliquid phase organic compounds are degraded to their corre-sponding intermediates and further mineralized to carbondioxide, water and inorganic ions (from heteroatoms) ( Eq.

(2.12) can generally be divided into ﬁve independent steps
(Herrmann, 1999 ): 1) mass transfer of the organic contami-
nants in the liquid phase to the TiO 2surface; 2) adsorption of
the organic contaminants onto the photon activated TiO 2
surface (i.e. surface activation by photon energy occurssimultaneously in this step); 3) photocatalysis reaction for theadsorbed phase on the TiO
2surface; 4) desorption of the in-
termediates from the TiO 2surface and 5) mass transfer of the
intermediates from the interface region to the bulk ﬂuid. Interms of rate determination, the overall rate of reaction isequal to the slowest step, which could possibly be either themass transfer step or the reaction step. Vinodgopal and Kamat
(1992) also reported the dependence of the photodegradation
rate of the organic surrogate on surface coverage of the pho-tocatalysts used. This outlines the importance of moleculesadsorption or surface contact with the catalyst during thephotocatalytic degradation. Another factor that greatly re-stricts the photocatalytic activities of TiO
2is the low quantum
yield of excitons due to the fast electron ehole (e/C0ehþ)
recombination. The other important factor is the recombina-tion of radical intermediates on the TiO
2surface. Partially
oxidized species could undergo reduction by electrons (andpartially reduced ones undergo oxidation by holes and/or
surface
/C15OH) to give back the initial substrate ( Vione et al.,
2005 ). Besides, there are other operational parameters that
could inﬂuence the process of photocatalytic degradation,e.g., light intensity, nature and concentration of substrate (i.e.,organic pollutants), nature of photocatalyst (e.g., particle size),concentration of photocatalyst, pH and reaction temperature(Gaya and Abdullah, 2008 ).
3. Limitations and countermeasures in TiO 2-
based photocatalytic processes
TiO 2photocatalysis is one of the most efﬁcient destructive
technologies among advanced oxidation processes (AOPs),
because it appears to utilize solar energy to lead to the totalmineralization of most of the organic pollutants that exist inair and aqueous systems ( Legrini et al., 1993 ). However, its
application is limited because of its narrow photocatalyticregion ( l<400 nm) and ability to absorb a small fraction ( <5%)of incident solar irradiation and indoor light, which results
from its relatively large band gap (anatase, ~3.2 eV) ( Yin et al.,
2003 ). Hence, any improvement of the photocatalytic efﬁ-
ciency of TiO
2by shifting its optical response to the visible
range will have a profound positive effect.
Since photocatalytic degradation mainly occurs on the
surface of TiO 2, mass transfer limitation has to be minimized
for effective TiO 2application in water treatment. However,
due to its poor afﬁnity towards organic pollutants (especiallythe hydrophobic organic pollutants), the adsorption oforganic pollutants on TiO
2surface is relatively low, resulting
in slow photocatalytic degradation rates. Therefore, how to
concentrate the target pollutants around the TiO 2nano-
particles to enhance photocatalytic efﬁciency requiresconsideration. Besides, during the photocatalytic degrada-tion process, the TiO
2nanoparticles may undergo aggrega-
tion due to the instability of the nanosized particle, whichmay hamper the light incidence on the active centers andconsequently reduce its catalytic activity ( Gao et al., 2011;
Mallakpour and Nikkhoo, 2014 ). However, it should be
noted that it may well happen that small particles showhigher scattering, which can reduce their photocatalytic ac-tivity compared to larger ones ( Minero and Vione, 2006 ).
Furthermore, for the slurry system, one main practical chal-
lenge to overcome is to recover the nanosized TiO
2particles
from the treated water in regards to both the economicconcern and safety concern. The above limitations in theapplication of TiO
2-based particles for photocatalytic degra-
dation of organic pollutants are summarized in Fig. 2 .
To overcome those limitations of TiO 2-based photo-
catalysis, the following countermeasures have been adoptedin previous studies: 1) modiﬁcation of TiO
2catalyst, in order
to achieve the utilization of visible light ( Bannat et al., 2009;
F. Dong et al., 2011 ); 2) optimization of catalyst synthesis, in
order to obtain catalysts with a deﬁned crystal structure,
smaller particle sizes, and high afﬁnity to various organicpollutants ( Makarova et al., 2000; Lightcap et al., 2010 ); and
3) design and development of second generation of TiO
2
catalyst, with high separation ability, which can be recov-ered and regenerated effectively ( Nakayama and Hayashi,
2007; Gad-Allah et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2013 ). The pur-
poses of these modiﬁcations and developments were toimprove photocatalytic efﬁciency, complete degradation oforganic pollutants, improve visible light absorption,

overcoming these limitations, and the mechanisms anddrawbacks of each countermeasure are brieﬂy summarizedinTable 2 and are discussed in detail in the following
sections.
3.1. Approaches to enhance the visible-light
photocatalytic activity of TiO 2particles
How to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2in the
visible region is the main focus of the recent TiO 2photo-
catalysis research. Several approaches for TiO 2modiﬁcation
have been proposed: metal-ion implanted TiO 2(e.g., Au)
(Anpo, 2000; Fuerte et al., 2001 ), non-metal doped-TiO 2(e.g., N)
(Ohno et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003b; Pelaez et al., 2012 ), com-
posites of TiO 2with semiconductor having lower band gap
energy (e.g. sensitizing of TiO 2with dyes) ( Chatterjee and
Mahata, 2001 ) and TiO 2doped with upconversion lumines-
cence agent ( Zhou et al., 2006; J. Wang et al., 2007 ). The
mechanisms of each modiﬁcation approach and their ad-
vantages and drawbacks are discussed in detail in the
following.
3.1.1. Doping with metals
Over the past decades, metal-doped TiO 2(e.g., Cu, Co, Ni, Cr,
Mn, Fe, Ru, Au, Ag, Pt) photocatalysts have been widely stud-ied for improved photocatalytic performance on the degra-dation of various organic pollutants under visible lightirradiation ( Anpo, 2000; Fuerte et al., 2001; Arabatzis et al.,
2003; Hu et al., 2006; Zang and Farnood, 2008; Zaleska, 2008;Han et al., 2014 ). TiO
2particles can be simply substitution-
ally or interstitially doped with different cations, can form
mixed oxides or a mixture of oxides. The dominant parame-ters include the character and concentration of dopants andthe applied thermal treatment ( Soria et al., 1991; Palmisano
et al., 1994 ). Many controversial results are reported in the
literature since even the method of doping (e.g., impregnation,coprecipitation, and sol egel methods) leads to different
morphological and crystalline properties of the photocatalyst(Zaleska, 2008 ).The effect of metal ion dopants on the photocatalytic ac-
tivity is a complex problem. The visible light photoactivity of
metal-doped TiO
2can be explained by a new energy level
produced in the band gap of TiO 2by the dispersion of metal
nanoparticles in the TiO 2matrix. As shown in Fig. 3 , electrons
can be excited from the defect state to the TiO 2conduction
band by photons with energy equal to hv 2. An additional
beneﬁt of transition metal doping is the improved trapping ofelectrons to inhibit electron ehole recombination during irra-
diation ( Fig. 3 ). Deposition of metal nanoparticles with a large
work function, such as Ag ( Tran et al., 2006 ), Pt ( Kowalska
et al., 2008 ), and Au ( Subramanian et al., 2001; Wang et al.,
2008; Bannat et al., 2009 ), onto TiO
2surface has been found
to efﬁciently retard the e/C0ehþrecombination because of the
Schottky barrier formed at the metal eTiO 2interface. Decrease
of charge carriers recombination results in enhanced photo-activity. Here, the metal nanoparticles act as a mediator instoring and shuttling photogenerated electrons from the TiO
2
surface to an acceptor. Iliev et al. (2006) demonstrated that
deposition of Pt or Ag on the surface of TiO 2greatly enhanced
the photocatalytic degradation of oxalic acid due to theincreased separation of e
/C0ehþand higher rate of O 2reduction.
Besides the above causes for the enhanced photoactivity of
metal-doped TiO 2, there is another factor that should be taken
into account in the photocatalytic process. Since surface sitescan also be occupied by metal ion dopants, the surface prop-erties as well as the point of zero charge value of TiO
2may be
altered by doping, depending both on the type and amount ofthe dopant metal. Consequently, a modiﬁcation of adsorptionproperties takes place ( Fig. 3 ).Ranjit et al. (2001a,b) reported
that lanthanide ions can form complexes with various Lewisbases (e.g., acids, amines, aldehydes, alcohols, thiols, etc.)through interaction of these functional groups with the f-or-bitals of the lanthanides. Xu et al. (2002) found that the metal-
doped TiO
2(e.g., La3þ,C e3þ,E r3þ,P r3þ,G d3þ,N d3þ, and Sm3þ)
presents an improved NO 2adsorption. Li et al. (2004) also re-
ported an enhancement of saturated adsorption capacity andadsorption equilibrium constants of La
3þdoped TiO 2
compared to bare TiO 2for 2-mercaptobenzothiazole.
However, it was found that the photocatalytic activity of
metal-doped TiO 2could be inﬂuenced by dopant concentra-
tion. Ambrus et al. (2008) and Tong et al. (2008) reported an
improved photocatalytic performance for the optimum Fedopant concentration. Beyond the optimum concentration ofdopant, the photodegradation rate decreased. It wasconcluded that the dopant ions below an optimum dosage
level can act as electron ehole separation centers, and thus
enhance the photocatalytic efﬁciency, while the dopant ionswith dosage level exceeds optimum value, can act as elec-tronehole recombination centers which are detrimental to
the photocatalytic activity ( Wu et al., 2009 ). Besides, metal
doping showed other drawbacks: thermal instability of dopedTiO
2and requirement of more expensive ion-implantation
facilities ( J. Zhang et al., 2010 ). In addition, although noble
metals coupling could be efﬁcient in improving the photo-catalytic reactions, the cost-effectiveness needed by indus-trial application usually causes their replacement by more
economical transition or non-metals doping.

Compared with metal dopants, nonmetal dopants, such as C,
N, S, B, P, F and I ( Chen et al., 2007 ), may be more appropriate
for the extension of the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2into the
visible region because their impurity states are near thevalence band edge, but they do not act as charge carriers, andtheir role as recombination centers might be minimized.Numerous contributions have been devoted recently todeveloping effective TiO
2photocatalysts doped with
nonmetal elements to extend the light absorbance of TiO 2into
the visible region ( F. Dong et al., 2011; Likodimos et al., 2013;
Moustakas et al., 2013; El-Sheikh et al., 2014 ). Among all
nonmetal-doped TiO 2materials, N- and C-doped TiO 2nano-
materials have been found to exhibit superior photocatalyticactivity under visible light irradiation.
Until now, much effort has been focused on the research of
N-doped TiO
2(NeTiO 2). There have been a large number of
publications that deal with the preparation of N eTiO 2by
physical or chemical methods, including sol egel, sputtering,
ion implantation, mechanochemical and plasma-enhancedchemical vapor deposition method ( Zaleska, 2008 ). However,
different conclusions concerning the state of doped nitrogen
in the N eTiO
2lattice and the mechanism of band gap nar-
rowing have been derived ( Fig. 4 ). For example, Asahi et al.
(2001) proposed that substitutional-type doping using N was
effective for the band gap narrowing of TiO 2due to the mixing
of N 2p with O 2p states in the valence band based on spin-restricted local density approximation calculations onanatase. The N 2p state hybrids with O 2p states in anataseTiO
2doped with nitrogen because their energies are very
close, and thus the band gap of N eTiO 2is narrowed and the
material becomes able to absorb visible light. However, Irie
et al. (2003) and Lindgren et al. (2003) found that interstitial-
type doping of N atoms was related to the photo-threshold
energy decrease, which induced localized N 2p states withinthe band gap just above the top of the valence band, facili-tating the production of oxygen vacancies. Ihara et al. (2003)
reported that oxygen-deﬁcient sites formed in the grainboundaries is important to emerge vis-activity and nitrogendoped in part of oxygen-deﬁcient sites are important as ablocker for reoxidation. Zhao and Liu (2008) concluded thatTiO
2doped with substitutional nitrogen has shallow acceptor
states above the valence state. In contrast, TiO 2doped with
interstitial nitrogen has isolated impurity states in the middleof the band gap. These impurity energy levels are mainly hy-bridized by N 2p states and O 2p states.
Besides N eTiO
2, the carbon doped TiO 2(CeTiO 2) has also
received special attention ( Wu et al., 2013 ).Sakthivel and
Kisch (2003) reported that C eTiO 2was ﬁve times more active
than N eTiO 2in the degradation of 4-chlorophenol by visible
light. In the investigation of C eTiO 2, similar to the N eTiO 2,
there was also a debate as to whether the doped type of carbonis substitutional or interstitial ( Chen et al., 2007 ). This was
accounted for by the crystal form and synthesis method of
TiO
2.Valentin et al. (2005) reported that carbon can be doped
into TiO 2lattice and then strongly enhance the visible light
absorption of TiO 2via substituting oxygen sites or getting into
the interstitial positions of TiO 2, which is due to the intro-
duction of series of localized occupied states into the band gapof TiO
2lattice. In addition, some reports suggested that large
band gap narrowing could also originate from residual carbon-containing species with complex composition, throughincomplete removal of organic compounds in the calcinationprocedure ( Lettmann et al., 2001; Sakthivel and Kisch, 2003 ).
Besides, carbon doping can signiﬁcantly stabilize the anatase
TiO
2and improve the adsorption of organic pollutant mole-
cules on the catalyst surface ( Kang et al., 2008; Hahn et al.,
2009 ). Moreover, carbon doping can enhance the conductiv-
ity of TiO 2(Janus et al., 2006; Xiao and Ouyang, 2009 ), as it
could facilitate the charge transfer from the bulk of the TiO 2
structure to the surface region where the desired oxidationreactions take place ( Fig. 4 ).
In spite of the visible-light photocatalytic performance of
nonmetal-doped TiO
2, at the same time, there are some
problems with nonmental-doped TiO 2: 1) The doping of non-
metals into the lattice of TiO 2usually results in the formation
of oxygen vacancies in the bulk. These defects can act asmassive recombination centers of photo-induced electro-nehole pairs, which largely limit the visible light photo-
catalysis efﬁciency of nonmental-doped TiO
2for industrial
applications ( X.Y. Li et al., 2008; F. Dong et al., 2011 ). In view of
practical application, higher photocatalytic reaction efﬁciencyis required because the photocatalytic efﬁciency of nonmetal-doped TiO
2under visible light is still low ( Ozaki et al., 2007;
Dong et al., 2010 ). 2) The stability of nonmental-doped TiO 2
is also a concern in regard to the long-term efﬁciency of
photocatalysis. It is reported that the stability of N eTiO 2be-
comes worse after photoelectrolysis of water under visible
light irradiation due to a decrease in N concentration at thesurface layer ( Kitano et al., 2006 ). Deactivation of N-doped
TiO
2for the oxidation of 2-propanol in aqueous solution under
visible light after a reaction of 150 h was also observed, whichwas related to the liberation of doped N atoms ( Nosaka et al.,
2005 ). 3) The preparation method is another crucial factor that
should be considered for applications. The doping process ofthe nonmetal elements always involves thermal treatment athigh temperatures (400 e850
/C14C) or a long time of hydrother-
mal treatment, both of which are unfavorable in energy ( F.
Dong et al., 2011 ). Besides, expensive, toxic, or unstable pre-
cursors are used; undesirable gaseous byproducts are usuallyproduced in the preparation process; and the procedures are

photocatalysis: ①: narrowing band gap ( hv1: pure TiO 2;hv2:
non-metal doped TiO 2);②: facilitating electron transfer
from the bulk of the TiO 2structure to the surface region
(reaction sites); and ③: enhancing adsorption of
contaminants (RH).water research 79 (2015) 128 e146 134somewhat tedious, which, in all, make the preparation costly
and large-scale application difﬁcult ( Dong et al., 2009 ).
Therefore, development of new and optimization of existingphotocatalysts exhibiting activity under visible light withsurface characteristics of improved performance and havinghigh chemical and physical stability are crucial for broaderscale utilization of photocatalytic systems in commercialapplication.
3.1.3. Co-doping technique
More recently, the simultaneous doping of two kinds ofatoms into TiO
2has attracted considerable interest ( J. Zhang
et al., 2010 ). These co-doped TiO 2nanomaterials have been
demonstrated to have improved photocatalytic activitiescompared to those of non-doped TiO
2or single-ion doped
TiO 2, especially in the visible light region. For example,
monocrystalline TiO 2codoped with Eu3þand Fe3þshows
synergistic effect, which signiﬁcantly increases the photo-catalytic degradation of chloroform in solution (ﬁve timescompared to pure nanocrystalline TiO
2and about two to six
times compared to Fe3þor Er3þdoped separately, respec-
tively) ( P. Yang et al., 2002 ). It was proposed that Fe3þserves
as a hole trap and Eu3þas an electron trap, speeding up the
anodic and the cathodic processes, respectively, via
improved interfacial charge transfer. Livraghi et al. (2009)
investigated the decomposition of methylene blue by N eF-
codoped TiO 2in aqueous phase. It was found that F could
activate the active site of N by producing extra electrons tothe low energy orbital of N
b/C15(a paramagnetic species). Doping
with F and N created a synergism in which F improved theincorporation of N photoactive species into TiO
2.Cong et al.
(2007) reported that titania co-doped with N and Fe3þ
( 0 . 5w t % )d e c o m p o s e da5 0m L2 0m gL/C01rhodamine B solu-
tion completely in 4 h under visible light irradiation, faster
than N-doped TiO 2or Fe-doped TiO 2.H o w e v e r ,u n d e rU V
light, the photocatalytic activities of Fe eN co-doped TiO 2was
lower than that of undoped TiO 2. The nitrogen ions and Fe3þ
dopants could act as the recombination center of electrons
and holes, thus decreasing the UV photoactivity. Interest-ingly, some research reported that co-doped TiO
2photo-
catalysts exhibited good photoactivities under both UV andvisible light ( J. Zhang et al., 2010 ). For instance, Lin et al.
(2007) found that the phosphorus and nitrogen co-doped
titania showed high photoactivity in the UV illuminationand also in visible light. They suggested that the O ePeN
linkage would lead to the high photocatalytic activity.
In the recent studies, the different roles of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) were found in doped and co-doped visible-light-active TiO
2photocatalysts ( Rengifo-Herrera et al., 2009;
Rengifo-Herrera and Pulgarin, 2010; Banerjee et al., 2014 ;
Zhao et al., 2014 ).Zhao et al. (2014) showed that N eF co-doped
TiO 2exhibited the best performance to destroy 6-
hydroxymethyl uracil (6-HOMU), a model compound for cya-notoxins. Mechanistic investigations carried out in the pres-ence of scavengers for
/C15O2/C0,1O2(singlet oxygen),/C15OH, and hþ
vb
have shown that/C15O2/C0is the prime ROS leading to the photo-
catalytic degradation of 6-HOMU. Rengifo-Herrera and co-
workers proposed that for N eS co-doped TiO 2, photo-
generated holes formed under visible light irradiation do notpossess suitable reduction potential to generate/C15OH radical by
the oxidation of H 2O(Rengifo-Herrera et al., 2009; Rengifo-
Herrera and Pulgarin, 2010 ). It has also been reported that
less oxidative superoxide radical anion/C15O2/C0,a n d1O2species are
predominantly responsible for the photocatalytic bacterialinactivation under visible light irradiation, however, highlyoxidizing
/C15OH radicals are produced under UV light excitation,
which play active roles toward photocatalytic activity ( Rengifo-
Herrera et al., 2009; Rengifo-Herrera and Pulgarin, 2010 ).
As discussed in the previous section, the dosage level could
also be an important factor in inﬂuencing the photoactivity ofco-doped TiO
2. Below an optimum dosage level, the dopant
ions can act as electron ehole separation centers, promote the
charge separation, and thus enhance the photocatalytic efﬁ-ciency. However, as dosage level exceeds optimum value, thedopant ions can act as electron ehole recombination centers
which are detrimental to the photocatalytic activity. Wu et al.
(2009) found that 4.0 wt% of Au was found to be the optimum
dopant concentration for photodegradation of methyl orangeby Au/N-doped TiO
2under both UV and visible light irradia-
tion. Higher amounts of gold deposition ( >4.0 wt% Au) caused
decreased photocatalytic activities through an electron ehole
recombination process. In addition, the high concentrations
of Au may also block the N eTiO 2from absorbing the incoming
photons.
Besides high catalytic activity for photodegradation of
organic pollutants, the issue of physiochemical stability andreuse of the synthesized photocatalysts is another mainobjective in this research area. Unfortunately, only a few pa-pers have reported on the stability and reuse of co-doped TiO
2
(Gombac et al., 2007; Huo et al., 2009 ).Huo et al. (2009) evalu-
ated the performance of N and F co-doped TiO 2in methylene
blue degradation through ten successive batches. After tenconsecutive photocatalytic experiments, the N and F co-doped
TiO
2photocatalyst retained high photocatalytic performance.
Gombac et al. (2007) investigated the stability of N eB co-doped
TiO 2for photodegradation of methyl orange and found that
after four cycles, a relatively small decrease of the catalystactivity was observed. They suggested that the presence of Ballowed a stronger retention of N-containing species.Currently, no report on the changing of concentration orcomposition of the dopants after long time of reaction isavailable. It is worthwhile to indicate that research on stabilityand reuse of these co-doped TiO
2catalysts is in high demand
in both academic and commercial sectors.
3.1.4. Surface organic modiﬁcation
As mentioned above, those metal/nonmetal-doped TiO 2ma-
terials were generally somewhat difﬁcult to be prepared withthe needs of lattice exchange at high temperature andmultistep experimental process. In the past decade, surfacemodiﬁcation of TiO
2with organic ligands has drawn much
attention.
3.1.4.1. Dye sensitization. Visible light-induced dye-sensitized
TiO 2photocatalysts can be readily prepared under a mild
condition through interfacial adsorption of dye molecules on
TiO 2in an ambient environment ( Bae et al., 2004; Chen et al.,
2005 ). Thus, much interest has been shown in surfacewater research 79 (2015) 128 e146 135modiﬁcation of TiO 2with organic dyes for construction of dye-
sensitized photocatalytic systems under visible-light irradia-
tion ( Jiang et al., 2007 ). Dyes that are used as sensitizers
include erythrosin B ( Kamat and Fox, 1983 ), thionine ( Patrick
and Kamat, 1992 ), substituted and unsubstituted bipyridine
(O'Regan and Graetzel, 1991; M. Yang et al., 2002 ) and phtha-
locyanine ( Yu et al., 2003a ).
The absorption of TiO 2sensitized by a proper dye molecule
can be extended to visible region because the dye can absorbthe visible light to reach an excited state (Eq. (3.1))(O'Regan
and Graetzel, 1991 ). The dye in the excited state has, in gen-
eral, a lower redox potential than the corresponding ground
state. If the redox potential is lower than the conduction band
(CB) of TiO
2, an electron may be injected from the excited state
into the CB (Eq. (3.2) andFig. 5 ), and consequently the cationic
radicals and CB electron are formed. Surface sensitization ofTiO
2by electron transfer via chemisorbed or physisorbed dyes
can 1) increase the efﬁciency of the excitation processes and 2)expand the used wavelength range through excitation of thesensitizer followed by an electron transfer between theexcited dye and the CB of TiO
2. Depending on its redox envi-
ronment, the dye is able to donate (in most cases) or receive anelectron improving electron ehole separation ( Kiriakidou
et al., 1999 ).

If the oxidative energy level of the excited dye/complex
compound is favorable (i.e., more negative) with respect to the
CB level of the semiconductor, the dye molecule can transfer
the electron to the CB of the semiconductor. A prerequisite forthis electron transfer is a low quantum yield of the redoxprocess catalyzed by the dye/complex molecule ( Fan and Bard,
1979 ). The injected electron reacts with surface adsorbed O
2to
yield O 2/C15/C0(Eq. (3.3)), which produces HO 2/C15on protonation (Eq.
(3.4)) and subsequently/C15OH (Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6 )) leading to the
degradation of the organic pollutants ( Fig. 5 ).
Dye-sensitized photocatalysis begins with the light ab-
sorption of dye and a subsequent electron transfer from theexcited dye to the conduction band of TiO
2. The electron
transfer from excited dye to TiO 2usually depends strongly on
the adsorption efﬁciency of the dye molecule ( Zhao et al.,
1998 ). However, in the case of the dye-sensitized TiO 2photo-
catalyst, the dye molecules are only absorbed onto the TiO 2
surface by physical/chemical adsorption. No steady chemicalbond is formed between TiO
2and dye molecules. So the dye
molecules as sensitizers tend to partially desorb, which candecrease photocatalytic activity during the photocatalytic re-action process; and the activity can be deeply depressed by thecompetitive adsorption of other coexisting species in the so-lution. Considering that pollutants usually exist at high con-centration in actual wastewaters, dye-sensitizedphotocatalysis may face difﬁculties to keep a valuable electrontransfer efﬁciency. In addition, while the dye-sensitized TiO
2
is efﬁcient in the utilization of visible light, all of the known
sensitizers are toxic and unstable (i.e., undergo degradation)
in aqueous solution, thus making them unsuitable for appli-cations in photocatalysis ( Zhao et al., 2005 ).
3.1.4.2. Organic coating. In the past decades, the modiﬁcation
of TiO 2nanoparticles with organic chelating ligands has been
a key research topic because it does not only induce dramaticchanges in the electrical and optical properties of the nano-particles, but it also results in the occurrence of other desir-able properties. For example, Cozzoli et al. (2003) prepared
organic-capped anatase TiO
2nanorods at 80/C14C, which can be
dispersed in organic solvents to form optically clear concen-
trated solutions because of oleic acid surface modiﬁcation.Niederberger et al. (2004) developed a nonaqueous sol egel
method to synthesize water-soluble dopamine-functionalizedanatase TiO
2nanoparticles. X.Y. Li et al. (2008) developed an in
situ chemical oxidative polymerization method in hydro-chloric acid solutions to synthesize TiO
2nanoparticles modi-
ﬁed by polyaniline. These nanoparticles exhibit signiﬁcantlyhigher photocatalytic activity than neat TiO
2on the degrada-
tion of phenol aqueous solution under visible light irradiation.
Jiang et al. (2007) developed a simple surface modiﬁcation
of TiO 2nanocrystals through a traditional organic reaction
between the surface hydroxyls on TiO 2nanoparticle and the
eNCO groups of tolylene diisocyanate (TDI). It is noteworthy
that a steady chemical bond is formed in the TDI-modiﬁedTiO
2by the chemical reaction. Due to the existence of the
surface complex, the absorption edge of as-prepared TDI-modiﬁed TiO
2nanomaterial extended well into the visible
region. It was found that the TDI-modiﬁed TiO 2material could
largely absorb visible light and showed improved photo-catalytic performance compared with unmodiﬁed TiO
2.
Chen et al. (2009) proposed the visible light-induced pho-
tocatalytic mechanism of TiO 2eTDI photocatalyst. In the case
of TiO 2eTDI, a direct electron transfer from the organic ligand
moiety to the conduction band of TiO 2is achieved upon ab-
sorption of visible light. The conduction band electron then
Fig. 5eThe mechanism of the photocatalytic
decomposition of organic pollutants (RH) over organic
ligand (OL) modiﬁed TiO 2under visible light.water research 79 (2015) 128 e146 136reacts with surface adsorbed oxygen to produce superoxide
radical, which subsequently induces the degradation of
coexisting organics in the solution. The organic ligand moiety,however, was not cleaved from the surface of TiO
2. It was
subsequently recovered by capturing an electron from theenvironment (e.g. the reductive species generated during thephotodegradation of organics), and then carried out anotherreaction cycle with the absorption of another visible lightphoton. Thus, the whole visible light-induced photocatalyticprocess of TiO
2eTDI can be expressed brieﬂy as follows (Eqs.
(3.7)e(3.10) ) and Fig. 5 .

3.2. Approaches to enhance adsorption of organic
pollutants on TiO 2particles
Adsorption of contaminants in the vicinity of the photo-
catalytic sites promotes the photodegradation of contami-nants that normally do not or in low quantities adsorb on thephotocatalyst surface. Thus, improving contaminant adsorp-tion by modifying TiO
2surface is another way to enhance its
photocatalytic activity. Modiﬁcation of TiO 2surface using
chelating ligands has been investigated to enhance adsorption
of organic contaminants ( Makarova et al., 2000 ). Moreover,
fullerene or graphene-modiﬁed TiO 2particles also have
shown excellent adsorptive and semiconducting properties(Oh et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012 ).
3.2.1. Surface organic modiﬁcation
The coordination sphere of the surface titanium atoms is
incomplete and thus exhibits high afﬁnity to oxygen-containing ligands to form chelating structures. Makarova
et al. (2000) investigated the effect of three groups of com-
pounds on adsorption of nitrobenzene (NB): a long chain
carboxylic acid (lauryl sulfate) to make the surface of the TiO
2
particles hydrophobic; an amino acid ( L-arginine) with a high
afﬁnity for hydrogen-bonding and electron-donating proper-ties; and a benzene derivative (salicylic acid) that may formпeпdonoreacceptor complexes. It was found that the
adsorption of NB increased at all surface-modiﬁed TiO
2spec-
imens as compared with bare TiO 2. The best adsorption was
found for arginine-modiﬁed and salicylate-modiﬁed TiO 2,
while adsorption was smaller in lauryl-modiﬁed colloids. Thissuggests that hydrogen bonding, n eпand пeпinteractions
result in stronger adsorption of NB as compared with itsphysical adsorption due to the presence of a hydrophobic
environment on the particle surface. Moreover, due to strong
electron donating properties, arginine provides a stable sur-face layer with a controlled reductive degradation pathway forNB. Arginine also improves the coupling between NB and TiO
2,
and electrons from the conduction band of TiO 2can be
transferred to NB without signiﬁcant activation energy. Theseresults indicate that surface modiﬁcation of nanocrystalline
TiO 2with electron-donating chelating agents is an effective
route to enhance both adsorption and decomposition ofnitroaromatic compounds.
In recent years, molecularly imprinted polymers, owing to
their attractive selectivity, have been introduced to improvethe selectivity of the TiO
2photocatalyst ( Xu et al., 2014 ). By
using estrone as a template molecule, Xu et al. (2014) prepared
molecularly imprinted TiO 2hybridized magnetic ferroferric
oxide (Fe 3O4) nanoparticles through a semicovalent approach
by a liquid phase deposition method, for selective photo-catalytic degradation and removal of target estrone with the
irradiation of UV light. The obtained Fe
3O4@SiO 2@imprinted
TiO 2displayed high adsorption capacity, fast kinetics and high
selectivity. Also, excellent stability during long-time photo-catalysis was exhibited. More importantly, the Fe
3O4@im-
printed TiO 2provided potential application prospective for
photocatalytic removal of trace target organic pollutants inthe presence of other high-level pollutants.
3.2.2. Doping with carbon-based nanoparticles
It has been conﬁrmed that TiO 2/carbon composites or carbon-
modiﬁed TiO 2could increase the adsorption capacity and
improve photodegradation performance in the visible region
(Janus et al., 2006; Shao et al., 2010 ). Composites of TiO 2/C have
also been shown to improve the energy and power density ofelectrochemical cells and enhance the energy-storage capac-ity (Cheng et al., 2008 ). Therefore, TiO
2composited with car-
bon of different forms, such as fullerene ( Oh et al., 2007 ),
activated carbon ( W.D. Wang et al., 2007 ), graphene
(Kamegawa et al., 2010 ) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) ( Woan
et al., 2009 ) have been fabricated to obtain novel structures
and properties.
Activated carbon was initially used as a support for TiO 2in
photodegradation studies ( Fu et al., 2004 ). Loading TiO 2on
activated carbon has drawn great attention since the highadsorption capability of activated carbon can help to enrichorganic substrate around the catalyst, promoting thepollutant transfer process and hence increasing the photo-catalytic efﬁciency ( Y. Li et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2008 ). The
synergistic effect of adsorption by activated carbon and pho-tocatalytic decomposition by TiO
2has been observed in the
degradation of several types of organic pollutants ( Matos et al.,
2007; Lim et al., 2011 ).Matos et al. (1998) determined that there
is a synergistic effect when using TiO 2mixed with activated
carbon having a surface area of 775 m2/g. The phenol degra-
dation enhancement was attributed to the strong adsorption
of phenol and its intermediate species on the activated carbonfollowed by subsequent mass transfer of the species to thephotocatalytically active TiO
2.Wang et al. (2012) synthesized a
high thermal stability C-doped SiO 2/TiO 2coated with acti-
vated carbon nanoporous composites. The as-synthesizednanoporous composites exhibit both much higher absorp-tion capability and better photocatalytic activity for thephotooxidation of methylene blue than pure TiO
2. The higher
absorption capability and better photocatalytic activity areattributed to their high surface area, well conductivity and
higher visible light absorption intensity.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) also provide a larger speciﬁc
surface area similar to activated carbon and thus enhance thewater research 79 (2015) 128 e146 137photocatalytic degradation as explained above. Beyond the
surface area, CNTs may be tailored to enhance speciﬁcity to-
ward adsorbents through the modiﬁcation of their surfacegroups ( Carp et al., 2004 ). When puriﬁed via acid treatment,
CNTs formed alcohol, keto, and acid moieties on their sur-faces. These groups can be further modiﬁed to improveadsorption of speciﬁc species, an advantage over activatedcarbons that are typically nonselective and have a lowerpollutant-degradation rate due to the degradation of all spe-cies (benign and pollutant) present ( Carp et al., 2004 ). Thus,
CNTs are also excellent candidates to allow deeper insightinto the semiconductor junction of TiO
2with metallic or
semiconducting carbons.
Among the same types of carbon supports, fullerene is very
promising for synergistic reasons; its energy sensitizationimproves the quantum efﬁciency and there is an increase ofcharge transfer between the fullerene and TiO
2by acidiﬁca-
tion of surface groups. Oh et al. (2007) prepared a fullerene/
TiO 2composite and investigated its photocatalytic effect.
Since fullerene has absorptive and semiconducting proper-ties, the fullerene/TiO
2composite revealed a sound photo-
degradation activity. The results revealed that the excellentactivity of the fullerene/TiO
2composites for organic dye
removal could be attributed to the synergistic effect of pho-
tocatalysis of the supported TiO 2and absorptivity of the
fullerene.
Graphene is recently emerging as one of the most prom-
ising materials to produce next generation photocatalysts(Morales-Torres et al., 2012 ), with excellent mobility of charge
carriers, large speciﬁc surface area, ﬂexible structure, hightransparency and good electrical and thermal conduction(Geim and Novoselov, 2007 ).Nguyen-Phan et al. (2011) pre-
pared TiO
2/graphene oxide composites for the photo-
degradation of methylene blue. Superior adsorption and
photocatalysis performance under both UV and visible radi-
ation were achieved in the presence of the composites ratherthan in pure TiO
2. The good photocatalytic performance on
the TiO 2egraphene oxide composite systems irrespective of
light sources could be attributed to a synergy effect includingthe increase in speciﬁc surface area in the presence of gra-phene oxide as well as the formation of both pepconjuga-
tions between dye molecules and aromatic rings and ionicinteractions between methylene blue and oxygen-containingfunctional groups at the edges or on the surfaces of carbon-based nanosheets. Graphene oxide plays the roles of adsor-bent, electron acceptor and photosensitizer in order to accel-
erate photodecomposition.
The photocatalytic activity of reduced graphene oxide
(RGO)eP25 composites (1 wt% GO) was also evaluated in the
degradation of methylene blue ( H. Zhang et al., 2010 ), a higher
conversion of methylene blue being found with these com-posites in comparison with bare P25. This photocatalyticenhancement was ascribed to (1) the two-dimensional planargrapheme structure favoring dye adsorption, (2) the suppres-sion of electron ehole recombination (due to the high elec-
trical conductivity), (3) enhanced light absorption in longerwavelengths of the visible region, and (4) high transparency
and band-gap narrowing resulting from the presence of
TieOeC bonds. In general, the carboxylic acid functional
group of GO facilitates binding of oxide particles. The high dyeadsorption is due to the formation of both pepconjugations
and the interactions between methylene blue molecules and
oxygenated surface groups at the edges or on the surfaces ofGO. Moreover, electron consumption occurs simultaneously,in which GO is partially reduced to RGO under UV assistanceand electrons are regenerated, resulting in the partial resto-ration of the conjugated pepnetwork ( Williams et al., 2008;
Lightcap et al., 2010 ). This phenomenon leads to an efﬁcient
charge separation and to the possibility of more pepin-
teractions between the composite and the organiccompounds.
3.3. Approaches for the stabilization of TiO 2particles
A large surface area can be the determining factor in certainphotodegradation reactions, as a large amount of adsorbedorganic molecules promotes the reaction rate ( Carp et al.,
2004 ). However, one problem that needs to be addressed
with nanosized photocatalysts is the difﬁculty in distributingsingle particles uniformly and reducing particle aggregation
(Nakayama and Hayashi, 2007 ). Two approaches are possible:
i) embedding them into a support structure or ii) modifyingtheir surface using organic coating to reduce particleaggregation.
3.3.1. Stabilization by support structures
Since photocatalytic degradation mainly occurs on the surfaceof TiO
2, mass transfer limitation has to be minimized for
effective TiO 2application in water treatment. It is well
recognized that the slurry form in which TiO 2powder is well
dispersed in suspension is more effective than the systems
with ﬁxed support ( Mascolo et al., 2007 ). However, during the
photocatalytic degradation process, the TiO 2particles may
undergo coagulation due to the instability of the nanosizedparticle, which will hamper the light incidence on the activecenters and consequently reduce its catalytic activity ( Yu and
Zhao, 2001; Cho et al., 2005 ). Furthermore, for the slurry sys-
tem, one main practical challenge to overcome is to recoverthe nanosized TiO
2particles from the treated water (which is
discussed in detail in the following section). How to concen-trate the target pollutants around the TiO
2particles to
enhance photocatalytic efﬁciency also requires consideration.
These challenges may be realized by mounting the nanosized
TiO 2particles on much larger particulates which should also
serve as a good pollutant adsorbent to attain synergisticpollutant removal and degradation.
In the past decade, an intense effort has been devoted to
loading TiO
2on different supports ( Carp et al., 2004 ), such as
glass beads, ﬁber glass, glass pellets, glass sheets, silica,organo-clays, stainless steel, Al
2O3ﬁber textile, c-Al 2O3,
quartz beads, polyethene and polypropylene ﬁlms, fabrics(cotton and polyester), activated carbon, and zeolites are used.Generally, the strategies focused on supported TiO
2are
developed in order to: 1) immobilize the TiO 2photocatalyst; 2)
increase the illuminated speciﬁc catalyst area; 3) increase the
adsorption capacity and surface area of the photocatalyst; and4) inﬂuence the selectivity of the photocatalytic reaction. Theﬁrst demand originates from the requirement to use photo-catalysts in continuous processes where the utilization of TiO
2
powder is technologically impracticable. Unfortunately, awater research 79 (2015) 128 e146 138small particle size leads to high ﬁltration costs of catalyst
removal, hindering its industrial application. For this reason,
the synthesis of photocatalysts with high activity and effec-tive separation properties simultaneously is a priority topic.
A photocatalyst surface is active only if it is illuminated. It
is difﬁcult to illuminate all the catalyst particles in suspendedsystems, because the particles further away from the lightsources are shielded from radiation by those near the lightsource. Hence, the penetration depth of light into suspensionsis limited. In immobilized systems, it is possible to obtain aconﬁguration in which all catalyst particles are illuminated,e.g., a thin layer coated on a tube surrounding a tube light
(Dijkstra et al., 2001 ).
Several attempts have been made to obtain hybrid photo-
catalysts, which are expected to induce synergism because ofthe adsorption properties of organic molecules ( Carp et al.,
2004). The basic concept is based on the physisorption of re-
actants on inert substrates followed by their surface diffusion tothe interface between the adsorptive sites and photocatalyticsites ( Chen et al., 1999; Tang et al., 2014a ). The ﬁrst step is
achieved by using supports with large surface areas foradsorption and high adsorption capacity for the target sub-stances, while the second is achieved only if the adsorption
strength is moderate enough to allow diffusion of adsorbed
substrates to the loaded TiO
2(Yoneyama and Torimoto, 2000;
Ao and Lee, 2003 ). Adsorbents such as silica ( Vohra and
Tanaka, 2003 ), alumina ( Tanaka et al., 2002 ), zeolites ( Reddy
et al., 2003 ), mesoporous molecular sieves, clays ( Ooka et al.,
2003)( T i O 2incorporated into the interlayer space of the clays),
and activated carbon ( Arana et al., 2003 ) have been used. In the
recent studies, Athanasekou et al. (2012, 2014) and Moustakas
et al. (2014) developed a highly efﬁcient hybrid photocatalytic/
ultraﬁltration process for water puriﬁcation using visible light.The process relies on the development of partially reduced
graphene oxide/TiO
2composite membranes and their incor-
poration into an innovative water puriﬁcation device thatcombines membrane ﬁltration with semiconductor photo-catalysis. Composites consisting of graphene oxide sheetsdecorated with TiO
2nanoparticles were deposited and stabi-
lized into the pores of ultraﬁltration mono-channel monolithsusing the dip-coating technique. These studies offer an immo-bilization alternative permitting scale-up ability and photo-reactor based water treatment industrial applications.
However, in spite of so many efforts, it is still unclear
which supports are most suitable in terms of mechanicalstability and selectivity. Besides, the activity of supported TiO
2
is normally lower than the unrestricted catalyst. This is mostlikely the immobilization reduces TiO
2's active surface area-
to-volume ratios and decreased mass-transfer rate, in addi-tion to the hindrance in light harvesting that is caused by themassive inactive supports ( Mascolo et al., 2007 ).
3.3.2. Stabilization by surface modiﬁcation
TiO 2particles suffer from severe aggregation during photo-
catalytic reactions, which would reduce their active sites andlight harvesting capability. As a result, the photocatalytic ac-tivity would be decreased ( Liu et al., 2012 ). Moreover, TiO
2
particles have little afﬁnity for organic matrix because of the
low particle size and high surface energy. For useful applica-tions, especially for the treatment of hydrophobic organicpollutants, many studies have been made on surface modiﬁ-
cation of TiO
2particles.
Carboxylic acids are most widely used as modiﬁers, with a
coordination of carboxylic groups (COOH) to surface Ti atoms(Weng et al., 2003 ).Mallakpour and Nikkhoo (2014) modiﬁed
the surface of TiO
2nanoparticles via grafting with amino acid
containing diacids. This surface modiﬁcation prevented theaggregation and allowed a homogenous dispersion of TiO
2
nanoparticles. Nakayama and Hayashi (2007) prepared poly( L-
lactic acid)-TiO 2nanoparticle nanocomposite ﬁlms by incor-
porating surface modiﬁed TiO 2nanoparticles into polymer
matrices. In the process of preparing the nanocomposite
ﬁlms, severe aggregation of TiO 2nanoparticles could be
reduced by surface modiﬁcation by using carboxylic acid andlong-chain alkyl amine. As a result, the TiO
2nanoparticles of
3e6 nm in diameter were uniformly dispersed in polymer
matrices.
Li et al. (2015) investigated the stability and the sorption of
phenanthrene on nano-TiO 2coated with humic acid (HA). The
nano-TiO 2sedimentation experiments indicated that the
presence of aromatic-rich HA was more capable of stabilizingnano-TiO
2particles than was the presence of aliphatic-rich
HA. This result is because the deionized phenolic groups in
the HAs were preferentially adsorbed on the nano-TiO 2sur-
faces, which generated a higher charge density on the nano-TiO
2surfaces and caused stronger repulsive forces among
particles. Furthermore, the aromatic-rich TiO 2-HA complexes
exhibited a greater sorption capacity than the aliphatic-richTiO
2eHAs complexes and nonlinear phenanthrene sorption
because of their higher afﬁnity and for the substrate.Romanello and Fidalgo de Cortalezzi (2013) studied the ag-
gregation rates, aggregate size and aggregate morphology ofNano TiO
2under the presence of inert electrolytes, divalent
cations, and these two combined with natural organic matter
(NOM). NOM adsorbed to the nanoparticles and made their
zeta potential more negative, hence stabilizing them bylowering the pH of maximum aggregation ( Dong and Lo,
2013a; Tang et al., 2014 ). Divalent cations partially neutral-
ized the adsorbed NOM, and at high concentrations aggrega-tion was observed with Ca
2þ, suggesting the presence of
speciﬁc Ca2þ-NOM bridges ( Dong and Lo, 2013b, 2014 ).Li and
Sun (2011) studied the aggregation/sedimentation potentials
of TiO 2nanoparticles in the presence of Suwannee River fulvic
acids (SRFA) at different pH values. The results showed thatSRFA adsorption signiﬁcantly enhanced the stability of TiO
2
nanoparticles at pH 4, 6 and 8, mainly due to the dramatic
increase in negative surface charges. Note that the organic
surface modiﬁers or NOM, in aquatic environments can notonly increase the stability of nanoparticles but can also in-ﬂuence the adsorption of hydrophobic organic compoundsand the number of available reactive sites on TiO
2particles.
Besides, the organic ligands (e.g., humic acids) can bedegraded by TiO
2(Uyguner and Bekbolet, 2009 ), so they are not
necessarily stable under photocatalytic conditions. Presum-ably, not all the methods used to obtain stable particle sus-pensions will lead to photoactive TiO
2. Therefore, future work
should be carried out to investigate the effects of surface
modiﬁers or NOM on the stability and photocatalytic activity
of TiO 2particles.water research 79 (2015) 128 e146 1393.4. Approaches for the separation of TiO 2particles
Finely dispersed TiO 2has large reactive surface area, but it is
difﬁcult to separate and recover these particles from liquidphase. Thus, the recovery and reusability of the TiO
2particles
is crucial and decides their further applications. The way toeffectively immobilize or separate the TiO
2particles is still a
challenge in the photocatalytic system. In order to solve theproblem of separation, two potential approaches have beenstudied, i.e., immobilized TiO
2onto various supports and
preparation of magnetic photocatalyst for magnetic separa-
tion ( Carp et al., 2004; Gad-Allah et al., 2007 ).
3.4.1. Immobilization on support structures
Some researchers immobilized TiO 2onto various supports,
such as glass ﬁbers, glass, quartz, stainless steel, etc. ( Carp
et al., 2004 ). This has been illustrated in detail in Section
3.3.1 . As discussed in the previous part, although these studies
provided a facile way to solve the particle aggregation andseparation problem, the photochemical reactivity of sup-ported TiO
2is normally reduced due to the reduction of TiO 2's
active surface area-to-volume ratios, the decreased mass-
transfer rate, and the inactive support 's hindrance in light
harvesting. Thus, although this approach provides a solutionto the solid eliquid separation problem, slurry-type reactors
offer signiﬁcant advantages over immobilized catalyst-typereactors because of the catalyst surface availability and su-perior mass-transfer properties ( Matthews, 1990 ).
3.4.2. Magnetic separation
Another solution to the separation problem is the utilization
of magnetic separation which provides a very convenientapproach for separating, recovering and reusing the ﬁne
photocatalytic magnetic particles by external magnetic ﬁeld
(Gong et al., 2009; He et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2014b ). Some
authors prepared composite nanoparticles with magneticcore and photoactive shell using magnetic granules and TiO
2
(Wang and Zhou, 2010 ). They conﬁrmed that magnetic TiO 2
photocatalysts present enhanced separation properties from
slurry photoreactors when an external ﬁeld is applied. Ingeneral, this type of composite photocatalyst comprises of aTiO
2shell and a magnetic core, making it recoverable due to
its magnetic properties such as superparamagnetism, highﬁeld magnetic irreversibility and high saturation magnetiza-
tion ( Wang and Zhou, 2010; He et al., 2012 ).
A number of materials with different elemental composi-
tions have been used as the magnetic core, such as Fe
3O4,g-
Fe2O3, NiFe 2O4, CoFe 2O4, FeCo, and Co 3O4. Among these, Fe 3O4
has drawn a lot of attention due to its remarkable magneticproperties, low toxicity, and biocompatibility ( Deng et al.,
2008; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhang and Zhu, 2012 ). However, a
direct deposition of TiO
2onto the surface of magnetic oxide
particles leads to high levels of photodissolution (i.e., disso-lution under inﬂuence of illumination) of the magnetic core. Ithas been proven that the addition of a silica layer between the
magnetic core and the TiO
2shell promotes the photocatalytic
activity of the catalyst by abating the adverse impact of themagnetic core and stabilizing the anatase form of TiO
2
(Martyanov and Klabunde, 2004 ). The presence of a silicamembrane provides magnetic nanoparticles with a chemi-
cally inert surface, helping to inhibit the oxidation of the Fe 3O4
core by the holes photogenerated in the outer layer TiO 2(Fu
et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009 ). However, the photocatalytic
activity of magnetic TiO 2is also inﬂuenced by the magnetic
core size, content of the silica layer and calcination temper-ature ( Gad-Allah et al., 2007 ).
Recently, research work is devoted to fabricating multi-
component photocatalysts with enhanced visible lightphotoactivity and ability to be recycled ( Li et al., 2011; Guo
et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012 ). Magnetic visible photo-
catalysts were investigated for overcoming the two funda-
mental drawbacks, i.e. photocatalyst recovery and visible
light utilization, hindering catalyst application and devel-opment in the ﬁelds of environmental pollutants and energysources ( Li et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012 ). Multi-component
photocatalysts with magnetic and photoactive propertiesprovide a way of achieving this. Guo et al. (2011) reported
that the Ag halides such as AgBr and AgI (which are photo-active to visible light) immobilized on SiO
2@Fe 3O4magnetic
supports exhibited faster degradation rates for 4-
chlorophenol than N eTiO 2. However, the Ag halides are
easily photo-reduced and quickly lose their stability. Liu
et al. (2013) prepared the magnetic AgBr eTiO 2/SiO 2@Fe 3O4
photocatalyst by solvothermal and sol egel methods, in
which photoactive AgBr eTiO 2was seeded on the SiO 2@Fe 3O4
shellecore magnetic support. The catalyst exhibited excel-
lent photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue undervisible light, and was easily separated and reused in ﬁvesuccessive runs, using an external magnetic ﬁeld. Tang et al.
(2013) designed a new photocatalyst, magnetic TiO
2e-
graphene, which integrates the functions of: (1) TiO 2pho-
tocatalysis, (2) excellent electron-capture ability and highadsorptivity of graphene, (3) magnetic separation, and (4)
high stability through suppressing photodissolution of the
magnetite by SiO
2(Wang et al., 2009 ). Taking advantages of
graphene and TiO 2, the catalyst exhibited strong light ab-
sorption in the visible region and high adsorption capacity toorganic pollutants, resulting in almost 100% photocatalyticremoval efﬁciency of typical herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) from water under simu-lated solar light irradiation, far higher than 33% on com-mercial P25. Furthermore, the catalyst can be rapidlyrecovered with highly stable photocatalytic performance.After 8 successive cycles, the removal efﬁciency of 2,4-Dmaintained 97.7%, and particularly, 99.1% 2,4-D removal
efﬁciency came back at the ninth recycle when the catalyst
was re-treated by ultrasonication.
3.5. Future challenges in TiO 2-based photocatalytic
processes
Despite the increased use and development in the past de-
cades, TiO 2-based photocatalytic technology still suffers from
some technical barriers that impede its commercialization.
Further research and development in this area are necessaryto overcome or mitigate these shortcomings and to expandthe use of the TiO
2-based particles for photocatalytic degra-
dation. Based on this review, the key areas for future researchare proposed as follows:water research 79 (2015) 128 e146 1401) Although many investigations have been carried out con-
cerning the modiﬁcation of the TiO 2surface to improve its
photocatalytic activity, little work has been reported on theenhancement of photocatalytic activity of magnetic TiO
2
particles under visible light through doping or/and surfacemodiﬁcation. Besides, the physicochemical stability andsustainability of non-metal doped or surface-modiﬁed TiO
2
particles for repetitive use have not been studied. It isnecessary to design a multifunctional photocatalyst thatintegrates the characteristics of excellent visible-lightphotocatalytic activity, high adsorption capacity, highstability, and magnetic separability.
2) A complete photodegradation of some POPs by the photo-
catalysts is still difﬁcult to achieve. More studies should becarried out with the aim of enhancing the reactivity ofphotocatalysts. Additionally, it is necessary to explore thepossibility of combined use of TiO
2-based technologies
with other technologies (e.g., biological means and elec-trodynamics) to expand the scope of application. Besides,the ﬁnal or the intermediate products of photocatalyticdegradation may not be innocuous substances. Thedegradation products can be more dangerous than theparent compound. Harmful by-products may cause
decrease in reaction rate and secondary pollution. There
has been scanty literature on the toxicity of the photo-catalyst or the overall photocatalytic process, especially forthe modiﬁed photocatalysts. Fundamental characteriza-tion and quantiﬁcation of the reactivity, toxicity and fate ofdifferent modiﬁed photocatalysts are needed.
3) TiO
2photocatalyzed reactions are non-selective oxidations.
Since they are governed by a free radical mechanism, thedegradation rate of a large variety of molecules is found to beapproximately the same. On the one hand, this lack ofsensitivity may be advantageous, but a poor selectivity also
implies that the catalyst does not differentiate between
highly hazardous contaminants and contaminants of lowtoxicity. The low toxicity contaminants can be easilydegraded by biological means, while many of the highlyhazardous materials are non-biodegradable. Therefore, it isnecessary to develop a photocatalyst system that can selec-tively degrade pollutants utilizing visible and/or solar lightirradiation, acting as a complement to biological techniques.
4) The previous work mainly focused on batch scale of pho-
tocatalytic degradation and magnetic separation forpollutant removal and particle recovery, but lack of appli-cation in a larger scale. Thus, there is a need for the design
of a prototype for the convenience of both photocatalytic
degradation of organic pollutants and particles recovery sothat it can be applied in real practice.
4. Conclusions
Photodegradation process of POPs by TiO 2-based particles has
attracted increasing attention during the past decades. How-
ever, its application is limited due to some main practicalchallenges: i) the inefﬁcient exploitation of visible light, ii) lowadsorption capacity for hydrophobic contaminants, iii) uni-form dispersion in aqueous suspension and iv) post-recoveryof the TiO
2particles after water treatment. This reviewsummarized the recently developed countermeasures for
improving the performance of TiO 2-based photocatalytic
degradation of organic pollutants with respect to the abovelimitations. Several approaches for enhancement of visible-light photocatalytic activity of TiO
2have been developed:
metal-doped TiO 2, non-metal doped-TiO 2, co-doped TiO 2(i.e.,
the simultaneous doping of two kinds of elements into TiO 2),
sensitizing of TiO 2with dyes and TiO 2doped with upconver-
sion luminescence agent. To enhance adsorption of organicpollutants onto TiO
2particles, two approaches have been
proposed: surface modiﬁcation of TiO 2with organic ligands
and doping with carbon-based nanoparticles. Two ap-
proaches are possible in distributing TiO 2particles uniformly
in suspension: embedding TiO 2particles into a support
structure or modifying their surface using organic coating toreduce particle aggregation. The separation of TiO
2particles
from aqueous phase can be achieved via immobilization onsupport structures or magnetic separation. However, eachcountermeasure still suffers from some technical barriers thatimpede its commercialization. Further research and devel-opment in this area are required to overcome these short-comings and to expand the application of the TiO
2-based
particles for photocatalytic degradation.
