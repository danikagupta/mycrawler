Sedationabstract
Propofol is an emulsion formulation of 2,6 diisopropylphenol developed in 1975. Widely recognized, it
offers beneﬁcial effects compared with other sedative drugs. Propofol is used in several clinical situationsincluding multiple surgical procedures and critical-care medical conditions. Since technological advances
over recent years have allowed an ever-increasing number of patients undergoing propofol therapy to be
monitored by using continuous digital EEG, it is important to have a complete understanding of theeffects of propofol on EEG in diverse clinical scenarios. This paper presents a review of the effects of pro-
pofol in electroencephalograms and discusses proconvulsive, anticonvulsive proprieties and the EEG ﬁnd-
ings in different medical conditions./C2112009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

1. Introduction
Propofol, an emulsion formulation of 2,6 diisopropylphenol, is a
short acting hypnotic drug available for parenteral administration
which was developed in 1975 ( Gepts et al., 1985 ). It is highly lipid-
soluble and readily permeating biomembranes such as the blood–brain barrier and rapidly getting to target sites in the brain. Thus,
the time of the onset of anesthetic effect is equivalent to the circu-
lation time from the arm to the brain. Furthermore, it can quickly
be redistributed from the brain into other tissues so that patients
can readily recover from the anesthetic state. Its fast onset and off-
set features make propofol ideal for ambulatory surgeries or anes-
thesia maintenance. In comparison with isoﬂurane and desﬂurane,propofol also has some antiemetic and euphoric effects (Gepts
et al., 1985; Tramer et al., 1997; Gupta et al., 2004 ).
The use of propofol in intensive care units is widely recognized
and offers beneﬁcial effects as compared with thiopentone, thio-
pental or etomidate, including decreased airway reactivity and
intraocular pressure, anti emesis, without the danger of drug
dependence, or change in adrenal function. There are, as well, sev-
eral potential advantages for sedation and seizure control in the
neurological and neurosurgical critically ill (Mirakhur et al.,
1987; Eames et al., 1996 ).
Technological advances over recent years have allowed an ever-
increasing number of critically ill patients to be monitored by
using continuous digital EEG, and it has become clear that ictal
activity is common in this environment (Niermeijer et al., 2003;
Nuwer, 2007 ). The continuous EEG monitoring techniques can
greatly enhance the neurological assessment and care of criticallyill patients to detect early signs of cortical instability, seizures

be made concerning therapy and prognosis (Scheuer, 2002; Kil-
bride et al., 2009 ).
Propofol is rapidly gaining popularity in patients as an anticon-
vulsant in status epilepticus ( Claassen et al., 2002 ) as well as a sed-
ative for respirator resistance. Over the past decade, cost hasbecome quite on important factor in choosing a sedative agent;
nevertheless, propofol has demonstrated a cost advantage over
midazolam in several cost analyses because of faster time to extu-
bation and, in most cases, an earlier discharge from the intensive
care units (ICUs). Despite the higher acquisition cost of propofol,
the shorter time spent in the ICU reduces total costs over the short
term (approximately <3 days) compared with midazolam (Hall,
et al., 2001; Crippen, 2002 ); hence it is important for EEG interpre-
tation to have a complete understanding of propofol effects in the
EEG in different scenarios.
2. Anticonvulsive effects of propofol and EEG
Propofol is a
c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist that sup-
presses seizure activity via GABA-mediated inhibition of neuronal
ﬁring. Other mechanisms of action include inhibition of the N-
methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and the modulation of cal-
cium inﬂux through slow calcium ion channels (Kanai et al.,
1999; Rossetti et al., 2005; Hayashi et al., 2007 ). Previous studies
that compare propofol with methohexital have consistently dem-onstrated that propofol (0.75–2.0 mg/kg) reduces seizure duration
as compared with methohexital (1.0–1.4 mg/kg) during electro-
convulsive therapy ( Simpson et al., 1988; Rouse, 1988; Dwyer
et al., 1988; Rampton et al., 1989; Mårtensson et al., 1994; Fred-man et al., 1994a; Avramov et al., 1995 ). Currently, continuous
intravenous (IV) infusion of midazolam or propofol, together with
continuous EEG monitoring, is a common mode of treatment of
refractory status epilepticus in children and adults (van Gestel
et al., 2005; Parviainen et al., 2006; Holtkamp, 2007 ). However,
there is no prospectively collected evidence that a burst-suppres-sion (BS) EEG pattern is required or is efﬁcacious for the termina-
tion of status epilepticus. Many patients can achieve complete
seizure control with a background of continuous slow activity
and do not incur the greater risks associated with higher doses of
medication required to achieve a BS pattern (Marik and Varon,
2004 )(Fig. 1 ).3. Proconvulsive effects of propofol and EEG
Many drugs used in anesthesia may induce cerebral excitation
during administration or withdrawal. Although the precise under-lying mechanisms of the proconvulsant effects of propofol, espe-
cially in seizure-prone individuals, remains to be elucidated
(Modica et al., 1990; Bevan, 1993; Mäkelä et al., 1993; Walder
et al., 2002 ), a potential mechanism for the proconvulsant proper-
ties of propofol may be due to intrinsic subcortical glycine antago-
nism or GABAergic agonism as suggested by animal data
(Albertson et al., 1991; Dolin et al., 1992; Hadipour-Jahromy and
Daniels, 2003 ). Today it is recognized that glycine receptors are
widely distributed throughout the CNS in humans (Tao and Ye,2002 .) and the antagonism of glycine receptors for strychnine to
the cerebral cortex in animals evokes epileptiform phenomenasuch as high-voltage waves in the EEG with concomitant paroxys-
mal depolarization shifts at the cellular level (Straub et al., 1997 ;
Deudeck et al., 2003 ). Furthermore, propofol increases the inhibi-
tion of GABAergic thalamopetal inputs to the thalamus, generates
thalamo-cortical oscillations and promotes high-voltage spike
and wave spindles and clinical seizures in animal models (Hadi-
pour-Jahromy and Daniels, 2003 ).
Propofol can induce clinical seizures and seizure like phenom-
ena (SLP) during induction, maintenance or emergence; it may
even be delayed after anesthesia and sedation in epileptic and non-
epileptic patients (Bevan, 1993; Walder et al., 2002 ). SLP are de-
ﬁned in ﬁve clinical presentation categories: (1) generalizedtonic–clonic seizures (GTCS); (2) focal motor seizures; (3) events
present such as increased tone with twitching and rhythmic move-
ments not perceived as generalized tonic–clonic seizures; (4) opis-
thotonus; and (5) involuntary movements. From a semiological
point of view, categories 1–3 are most suggestive of an epileptic
origin ( Walder et al., 2002 ).
In a recent systematic review study that included 70 patients
without known epilepsy who received a propofol induction dose
between 0.5 and 5.2 mg/kg, and between 3.0 and 13.2 mg/kg/h
during the entire intervention (combined with different analgesics)
showed SLP during the induction of anesthesia or sedation (24 pa-
tients; 34%), during emergence (28; 40%), or delayed (16; 23%). De-
layed SLP were 33 min to 6 days after anesthesia or sedation. Two
SLP (3%) occurred only during maintenance. SLP were generalized
tonic–clonic seizures in 30 patients (43%); the events presented
were increased tone with twitching and rhythmic movements

(16%), opisthotonus in six (9%) and focal motor seizures in three
(4%). An EEG was performed during the next 24–48 h on 24 pa-
tients (34%), after the SLP had stopped (Walder et al., 2002 ). Five
patients had an abnormal EEG (generalized spikes in two, general-ized slowing in three) ( Hopkins, 1988; Bevan, 1993; Mäkelä et al.,
1993; Borgeat et al., 1993; Mangan and Perala, 1995; Bragonieret al., 2000 ). Since the seizures generated by propofol appear to
be induced with low doses (Nadstawek et al., 1993 ), the rapid
changes of propofol concentration in the brain at the beginning
or end of anesthesia may be crucial for the generation of seizures.
In rats, propofol increases inhibition in the evoked potential mea-
surements from the dentate gyrus in a manner attributed to GAB-
Aergic agonists ( Albertson et al., 1991 ). GABAergic thalamopetal
inputs to the thalamus generate thalamo-cortical oscillations and
promote high-voltage spike and wave spindles in some genetically
deﬁned rat strains; these spindles are associated with unrespon-
siveness, eye blinking, and myoclonic jerks resembling human
nonconvulsive generalized epilepsy (Hadipour-Jahromy and Dan-
iels, 2003 ). Propofol may also cause the inhibition of mechanisms
that dampen epileptic activity, thus inducing seizures (Cochranet al., 1996 ).
There are several case reports of patients with epilepsy who re-
ceived anesthesia with propofol (Cameron, 1987; Jones et al., 1988;
Strowbridge, 1989; Bredahl, 1990; Paech and Storey, 1990; Collier
and Kelly, 1991; Borgeat et al., 1991; Mäkelä et al., 1993; Karadi-
mov et al., 1994; Slater, 1995; Bellver-Romero et al., 1997 ). SLP oc-
curred mainly during the emergence from anesthesia. Theinduction dose of propofol was between 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg. GTCS
occurred in 82% of the patients (Walder et al., 2002 ). Electroen-
cephalographic correlation was available only in two cases, whichshowed generalized slowing and spikes in one patient and focal
spikes in the temporal region in another (Bredahl, 1990; Mäkelä
et al., 1993 ). The general consensus among anesthesiologists is that
propofol should be avoided in patients with epilepsy (Paech andStorey, 1990; Collier and Kelly, 1991; Borgeat et al., 1991; Mäkelä
et al., 1993 ). This recommendation, however, is changing because
an increasing number of patients have manifested good outcomesduring epilepsy surgery (Hufnagel et al., 1990; Ebrahim et al.,
1994; Cheng et al., 1996; Hewitt et al., 1999; Soriano et al., 2000 ).
4. Relationship between propofol doses and
electroencephalographic ﬁndings
There are several studies that show the relation between propo-
fol doses and EEG changes during induction. A study in the pediat-ric population (21 children, 7–8 yrs) randomized children toreceive propofol at 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg or thiopental at 5–7 mg/
kg. The baseline EEG was normal in all the patients. The induction
EEG sequences were similar for the three groups: after a mean la-
tency of 12 s, the tracing showed an increase in frequency from 9
to 10 Hz (alpha waves) to more than 14 Hz (beta waves). This tran-
sition lasted approximately 2 s, followed by delta waves (2–3 Hz)
that continued for 1–2 min. Finally, beta waves reappeared pro-
gressively but incompletely replaced delta waves during the next
5 min (Borgeat et al., 1993 ). Delta waves are more common in
orbitofrontal regions ( Johnson et al., 2003; Sonkajärvi et al.,
2008 ). Besides, induction EEG sequences are similar using
2.5 mg/kg (Saint-Maurice et al., 1987 ).
Immediately following the induction of anesthesia there is a
marked depression of neuronal activity in the EEG. Subsequently,out of the almost ﬂat EEG, a spindle-shaped, rhythmic series of
waves emerge, to be later joined by typical BS patterns. These
14 Hz spindles waves with waxing and waning amplitudes ap-
peared simultaneously over several channels (Huotari et al.,2004 ). It resembles spindle-waves of sleep and barbiturates, which
generate in the thalamus and exclusively distributed to neocortex
along thalamo-cortical axons (Steriade et al., 1990; Mackenzie
et al., 2004; Feshchenko et al., 2004 ;Sonkajärvi et al., 2008 ). The
main components of propofol burst are the slow waves, whichare positive at all scalp or neck electrodes referred to the depth
electrodes and show a the highest amplitude in the frontopolar
electrode s
and the lowest in the central and parietal electrodes
when refer to the depth electrodes. Furthermore, the sharp wavesof the BS resemble the vertex waves of physiological sleep and
their distribution similar to that of the spindles. These similarities
with slow wave sleep could be explained by the effect of propofol
on the aurosal system (Sonkajärvi et al., 2008 ). Clinically the pa-
tients develop unconsciousness, which is secondary to the sup-pression of cortical activity (Velly et al., 2007 ) and the 50%
effective dose for propofol to induce loss of consciousness is
0.97 mg/kg (Iwakiri et al., 2005; Kodaka et al., 2006 ).
A propofol dose range of 40–200 mg produces burst-suppres-
sion in all patients, ( Hopkins, 1988; Nadstawek et al., 1993; Man-
gan and Perala, 1995 ) except during refractory status epilepticus,
in which case BS is initially achieved quickly but efforts to main-
tain BS require incremental doses of propofol (9.5 (8.2–11.0) mg/
kg/h). Despite high doses, propofol plasma concentrations remain
at the same level as has been measured during total IV intraoper-
ative anesthesia ( van Gestel et al., 2005; Parviainen et al., 2006 )
(Fig. 2 ). Animal experiments have shown that during BS EEG
approximately 95% of cortical cells switch over to alternating se-
quences of phasic depolarizing events (bursts) and electrical si-
lence (ﬂat periods), whereas 30–40% of thalamic cells continue to
discharge rhythmic spike bursts during ﬂat periods in neocortical
neurons. However, this occurs only when the ﬂat periods are lim-
ited to approximately 30 s (Steriade et al., 1994 ). The anesthetic-
induced neocortical BS activity appear to involve action sites whichare intrinsic to neocortex, requiring intact glutamatergic transmis-
sion; the transition from BS to isoelectric EEG activity appears to
result from an anesthetic-induced depression of glutamate-medi-
ated excitatory synaptic transmission (Lukatch et al., 2005 ). Be-
sides, animal studies using rats have shown that theelectrophysiological characteristics of BS induced by propofol vary
among BS induced by isoﬂuorane or thiopental, the BS induced by
propofol showing shorter duration and lower amplitude (Akrawi
et al., 1996 ).
The propofol infusion syndrome, characterized by cardiac fail-
ure, rhabdomyolysis, severe metabolic acidosis and renal failure
may be associated with a high-dose infusion of propofol (Bauer
et al., 2004 ). The dose of 4 mg/kg/h has been considered as the
upper limit in the sedation of critically ill patients for longer than48 h. The syndrome has been reported mainly in patients withacute neurological illnesses including status epilepticus (Hanna
and Ramundo, 1998; Vasile et al., 2003 ).
Status epilepticus patients frequently use a broad range of doses
of propofol (0.1–24 mg/kg/h) to achieve a cessation of status epi-
lepticus. However, propofol therapy achieves just 64% of complete
clinical seizure suppression, 78% of electrographic seizure suppres-
sion and 29% of the elimination of all epileptiform discharges (Pra-
sad et al., 2001 ).
Propofol can inhibit the interictal epileptiform activity in vitro
(Rasmussen et al., 1996; Ohmori et al., 2004 ). However, data on
propofol-induced EEG changes in epilepsy patients are limited toa few small size studies in adults, and it is not conclusive as to
whether propofol activates or depresses EEG seizure activity in this
patient cohort ( Hufnagel et al., 1990; Oei-Lim et al., 1992 ). A study
on the pediatric population has analyzed the propofol effects (bo-lus; mean (SD) 2.4 (1.0) mg/kg) and the continuous infusion rate
(mean (SD) 0.4 (0.2) mg/kg/h) in the EEG in 25 epilepsy patients
during sedation to carry out MRI studies. In 16 out of 18 patientsD. San-juan et al. / Clinical Neurophysiology xxx (2010) xxx–xxx 3ARTICLE IN PRESS

fol sedation there was demonstrated a suppression of spike-wavepatterns (>90% of baseline seizure activity). In addition, no depres-
sion or augmentation of EEG amplitudes, a primary occurrence, or
an increase in spike-wave patterns was seen. EEG changes induced
for propofol disappeared 4 h after terminating the infusion (Meyer
et al., 2006 ). In a study of 11 mentally handicapped adults with
pharmacologically treated epilepsy, propofol (mean (SD); 5.5(1.1) mg/kg/h) decreased epileptic activity in the EEG in three pa-
tients and paroxysmal discharge disappeared in two patients. The
EEG was unaffected by propofol in the remaining six patients dur-
ing conscious sedation ( Oei-Lim et al., 1992 ). Another study on 30
neurosurgical adult patients with or without a history of seizures(control group) showed that spike or sharp waves appeared in
33% of the control patients and in 40% of the epileptic group after
propofol 0.5 mg/kg and in 73% of the control and 67% of the epi-
lepsy patients after 1.5 mg/kg. In the majority of patients, the
spike-waves disappeared when additional doses of propofol were
administered. One patient in the epileptic group had an EEG-re-
corded and clinical grand mal seizure after propofol (1 mg/kg),
but the seizure disappeared after an additional 0.5 mg/kg bolus
was administered ( Nadstawek et al., 1993 ).Table 1 summarizes
the profolol doses and the main clinical and EEG ﬁndings.An alternative methodology to analyze the anesthetic effects of
the propofol doses on the brain activity is the EEG entropy. The
electroencephalographic entropy is a combined EEG and electro-
myographic (EMG) monitor used to measure the degree of brain
function and the depth of anesthesia. Entropy calculates two differ-
ent spectral entropy indicators; (1) the state entropy (SE) is com-
puted over the frequency range from 0.8 to 32 Hz. It includes the
EEG-dominant part of the spectrum and (2) the response entropy
(RE) is computed over a frequency range from 0.8 to 47 Hz. (Vier-
tiö-Oja et al., 2004; Riad et al., 2007 ). SE is a stable indicator of the
effect of hypnotics on the cortex. RE, on the other hand, reacts rap-idly to changes and serves as a nearly immediate indication of
frontal EMG activity and the impending awakening of the patient
(Davidson et al., 2005 ). RE ranges from 0 to 100, whereas SE varies
between 0 and 91 ( Viertiö-Oja et al., 2004 ). For fully awake and
responsive subjects, a value of 100 for RE and 91 SE, respectively,
is observed, i.e. the difference between these parameters is usually
<10. For clinically meaningful anesthesia and low probability of
consciousness, a value between 40 and 60 is considered appropri-
ate ( Riad et al., 2007 ). Some studies indicate that the propofol
anesthesia guide by EEG entropy signiﬁcantly reduces the totaldose of propofol (37%) and the induction dose (31.8%) mg/kg used
(Vakkuri et al., 2005; Riad et al., 2007 ). The sensitivity and speciﬁc-

Please cite this article in press as: San-juan D et al. Propofol and the electroencephalogram. Clin Neurophysiol (2010), doi: 10.1016/j.clinph.2009.12.016ity of the entropy has been demonstrated in previous reports; this
indicates that entropy is as efﬁcient as the Bispectral Index (BIS) in
predicting changes in the hypnotic component of anesthesia (Bon-
homme and Hans, 2004; Vakkuri et al., 2004 ), and the changes in
SE and RE values follow a similar pattern to the BIS values duringpropofol, thiopental, sevoﬂurane and desﬂurane induction in
adults ( Vakkuri et al., 2004, 2005 ). However, there is a wide vari-
ability in the response of patients to propofol that cannot be de-tected without the continuous monitoring of cortical electrical
activity during the operating period, e.g. an unexpected abnor-
mally low BIS and an almost isoelectric EEG pattern during typical
induction of anesthesia with propofol (1.26 mg/kg) (Rudner et al.,2005 ).
Other authors have suggested, however, that different stages of
anesthesia including the burst-suppression phase can easily be dis-
tinguished best by both nonconventional spectral measures, and
nonlinear measures. A study using scalp and deep hippocampus
and anterior parahippocampal gyrus recording simultaneously
showed increasing delta and alpha power with the deep structures
with increasing depth of anesthesia while scalp spectral entropy
and the Lyapunov-exponent in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus
decreased, expressing a more concentrated power spectrum at the
scalp position (C z) and reduced EEG chaoticity within rhinal cortex
during deeper levels of anesthesia ( Fell et al., 2005 ).
5. Relationship between age, propofol and
electroencephalographic ﬁndings
The number of older people who have to undergo surgical pro-
cedures is steadily growing. For these patients the risks of anesthe-sia are often increased because of their past medical history and
their restricted physiological resources. Apart from parameters of
the cardiovascular system, the electroencephalogram represents
a supplementary method for intraoperative monitoring, because
cerebral alterations caused by anesthetics or narcotics are directlyreﬂected in the EEG (Schultz et al., 1995 ). Older patients differ from
younger ones regarding the hypnotic effect of propofol and thespectral patterns in the EEG. During induction, patients older than
70 years reach signiﬁcantly deeper EEG stages than younger pa-
tients, needing a longer time to reach the deepest EEG stage and
more time for recovery to a light EEG stage. In patients aged
70 years and older, the total power, mainly in deep EEG stages, is
signiﬁcantly smaller due to a distinctly smaller absolute power of
the delta frequency band. During the steady state of anesthesia,
older patients need less propofol for the maintenance of a deﬁned
stage of brain function than younger patients (Schultz et al., 2004 ).
Fospropofol disodium (Aquavan
/C210injection; MGI Pharma, Inc.,
Bloomington, MN, USA) is a water-soluble prodrug of propofol cur-rently under investigation for diagnostic procedures. Fospropofol is
rapidly hydrolyzed by endothelial alkaline phosphatases in vivo
after intravenous administration, releasing propofol, phosphate
and formaldehyde. Fospropofol derived propofol is the active com-
pound that provides sedation and has a slower pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic proﬁle than propofol lipid emulsion; it
could hence, be a better option in elderly patients or another spe-
cial population (Fechner et al., 2005; Levitzky and Vargo, 2008 ).
6. Propofol and epilepsy surgery
Previous studies have addressed the action of propofol on the
electrocorticogram (ECoG) during epilepsy surgery with markedly
different results (Hewitt et al., 1999 ). Propofol does not interfere
with intraoperative ECoG during awake craniotomies (Sorianoet al., 2000; Herrick et al., 1997 ) and there was no activation of
the ECoG with propofol at 0.5–5 mg/kg in children and adults(Hufnagel et al., 1990; Ebrahim et al., 1994; Cheng et al., 1996; He-
witt et al., 1999; Soriano et al., 2000)( Fig. 3 ).Other authors demon-
strated ECoG activation with propofol 2 mg/kg and 150 mg,
respectively, in both cases in combination with other medications,
including fentanyl ( Hodkinson et al., 1987; Mäkelä et al., 1993 ).Table 1

pofol anesthesia might be caused by co-medication (Cheng et al.,1996 ). The only ﬁnding during epilepsy surgery is a higher fre-
quency background ECoG activity, but this does not interfere with
ECoG interpretation (Johnson et al., 2003 )(Fig. 4 ).
Intracranial monitoring of patients with partial epilepsy using
depth electrodes implanted in the hippocampi and temporal neo-
cortex and plasma propofol concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and
1.2lg/ml during 30 min demonstrated no a signiﬁcative change
in epileptiform activity with sedative doses of propofol (Herricket al., 1997 ).
7. Propofol and electroconvulsive therapy
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is still considered the most
effective biological treatment strategy in psychiatric disorders(Eser et al., 2009 ). The most widely studied hypnotic agents for
use in ECT are methoxital, etomidate and propofol (Folk et al.,2000; Ding and White, 2002 ). However, in some countries, propo-
fol is the only hypnotic agent available to the anesthesiologist forECT ( Porter et al., 2008 ). Propofol has a favorable cardiovascular
proﬁle advantages ( Rampton et al., 1989 ), rapid recovery, and re-
duced agitation (Fredman et al., 1994b; Nguyen et al., 1997 ). How-
ever, it has a major disadvantage in that it is antiepileptic andreduces seizure length if used in traditional anesthesia induction
doses of 2 mg/kg ( Simpson et al., 1988 ). The clinical efﬁcacy of
ECT may be affected by stimulus variables and the concomitantuse of psychopharmacological medication; nevertheless, recent
studies comparing propofol with thiopental anesthesia have
shown that the clinical effectiveness is similar in both anesthetic

fol signiﬁcantly decreases seizure duration and offers the best
recovery proﬁle compared with thiopental or etomidate (Rosa
et al., 2008; Eser et al., 2009; Bauer et al., 2009 ). However, propofol
requires a higher mean electric charge to induce a seizure duringthe ECT (Rosa et al., 2008 ).
The EEG is recorded bilaterally from the frontal and mastoid
electrodes during the ECT and the EEG seizures length can be mea-
sured directly for visual inspection; detection software are even in-
cluded in some ECT devices (Porter et al., 2008 ). EEG measures may
better predict the clinical efﬁcacy of treatment. For example, thepostictal suppression index, shown in several studies to correlate
with clinical efﬁcacy is calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of
the postictal EEG divided by the amplitude of the baseline EEG (No-
bler et al., 1993; Perera et al., 2004; Porter et al., 2008). The appli-
cation of electroencephalography is recommended in monitoring
patients with prolonged confusion following ECT to diagnose non-
convulsive status epilepticus (Povlsen et al., 2003 ).
8. Conclusions
Propofol is a unique short acting hypnotic with several advanta-
ges over other anesthetic drugs. Over the time, the use of propofol
is increasing as anticonvulsant and as a sedative agent. Hence, the
knowledge of the electroencephalographic changes induced by
propofol is relevant to neurologists, anesthesiologists, neurophysi-
ologists or other health care professionals involved in the medical
attention of the critical ill patients and other patients undergo
anesthesia with propofol.
Propofol can suppress the seizures activity via GABA agonism,
inhibition of the NMDA receptor and modulation of the slow cal-cium ion channels, several range of doses can suppresses the inter-
ictal and ictal activity abolish the epileptiform discharges,
electrographic seizures, clinical seizures and the status epilepticus
inducing the burst-suppression pattern. However, the same GABA
agonism and the glycine antagonism can also induce clinical sei-
zures and EEG epileptiform changes, the rapid changes of propofol
concentration in the brain at the beginning or end of anesthesia
may be crucial for the generation of seizures in both epileptic
and nonepileptic patients.
The sequences of the EEG changes induces by propofol is unique
between other anesthetic drugs. These EEG changes are more
prominent in the fronto-central regions and do not interfere with
the interpretation of the routine EEGs and intraoperative ECoG
during awake craniotomies.
During the anesthesia the continuous monitoring of cortical
electrical activity is used to measure the degree of brain function
and the depth of anesthesia. Currently, the entropy is as efﬁcient
as the Bispectral Index in predicting changes in the hypnotic com-
ponent of anesthesia correlated with EEG scalp ﬁndings, and these
measurements signiﬁcantly reduces the total dose of propofol and
the induction dose used during the surgical procedures. However,
during the ECT the sedation with propofol signiﬁcantly decreases
seizure duration and requires a higher mean electric charge to in-
duce a seizure. Although, recently studies have shown that the
clinical effectiveness is similar using other anesthetic drugs.
