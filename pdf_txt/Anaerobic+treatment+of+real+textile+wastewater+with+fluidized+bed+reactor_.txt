Abstract: The textile processing plants utilize a wide variety of dyes and other chemicals such as acids, bases, salts, detergents, sizes , 
oxidants, mercerizing and finishing chemical s. Many of these are not retained in th e final product and are discharged in the ef fluent. 
Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the perform ance of Expanded Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB) reactor to treat 
synthetic textile wastewater. Se veral experiments using Direct Red 81 and volatil e fatty acids as model substrates were conduct ed. 
The problems of decolorization was evaluated at a variety of re levant operational conditions, such  as substrate concentration, organic 
and hydraulic loading rates. The results showed that retention time of EGSB equals 1.6 h and 80 mg/L at the hydraulic and dye concentration respectively, and that the color removal efficiency can reach 90%. Additionally, some chemical additions were proposed to improve the decolorization rate and increase the treatment efficiency of the system. For instance, sulfide was adde d at 
200 mg/L in the influent, which can increa se the dye removal efficiency to 95%.

1. Introduction 
The textile processing plants utilise a wide variety 
of dyes and other chemicals such as acids, bases, salts, detergents, wetting agents, sizes, oxidants, mercerizing and finishing chemicals. Many of these are not retained in the final product and are discharged in the effluent. Even little release of effluents may cause abnormal coloration of surface waters, which can capture the attention of both the public and the authorities. 
There are several ways in which colorants cause 
problems in waters. The presence of dyes in natural waters reduces the penetration of sunlight and they may cause toxicity to a variety of organisms. In anaerobic sediments, azo dyes  are reduced, generating 
aromatic amines, some of which are toxic, mutagenicand/or carcinogenic to animal and humans. 
The treatment of colored wastewaters therefore is 
restricted not only to the reduction of ecological parameters (such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) etc.), but also to the

 reduction of dye concentrations in the wastewaters. 
In general, dyes containi ng wastewaters can be 
treated in two ways: (i) by chemical or physical methods such as chemical coagulation, chemical oxidation, electrochemical treatment, adsorption, ion exchange, membrane etc. [1, 2] and (ii) by means of biodegradation methods such as activated sludge, and UASB [3-6]. During conventional aerobic wastewater treatment, azo dyes are not degraded. On the other hand, azo linkages are easily reduced under anaerobic condition with digester sludge, anaerobic granular sludge and sediments [5-7]. The reduction of azo dyes results in the formation of aromatic amines. Most aromatic amines are not mineralized anaerobically. 
However, the aromatic amines are readily degraded aerobically [4, 5]. 
In an effort to design a cheap and effective 
bioremediation system for textile industry, an anaerobic system can be used to, at least partially, treat these effluents and provide a number of significant advantages. For many years the benefit and the drawbacks of Expended Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB) reactor have been the subject of discussion. D

With the use of effluent recirculation, liquid upward 
velocities exceeding 5 m/h to 6 m/h can be achieved, 
which is significantly higher than the 0.5 m/h to 1.5 m/h range generally applied for UASB reactor. This modification can improve wastewater-biomass contact during anaerobic treatment by expending sludge bed and intensifying the hydraulic mixing which enhances the penetration of substrate into biofilm. However, sludge washout may due to excessive expansion of the sludge bed and sludge erosion and deterioration by the high shear forces. 
So far, little information is available about the 
performance of EGSB to treat textile wastewater. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the performance of EGSB reactor to treat synthetic textile wastewater. Several experiments using Direct Red 81, and volatile fatty acids as model substrates were conducted. The problems of decolorization was evaluated at a variety of relevant operational 
conditions, such as substrate concentration, organic 
and hydraulic loading rates. Additionally, some chemical additions were proposed to improve the decolorization rate and increase the treatment efficiency of the system. 
2. Material and Method 
2.1 Biomass 
The reactors were inoculated with granular sludge 
that was obtained from a full scale UASB reactor treating the effluent of a potato processing factory. 
2.2 Reactors 
Experiments were performed using a 0.05 m 
diameter glass EGSB reactor (Fig. 1) with total volume 4.3 L (settler included). Temperature was controlled by

thermostat-cooling system which consisted of two 
different cooling device s (Fryka-Kaltetechnik, 
Germany and Rheinische Geraetebau GmbH, Switzerland) and a heat-exchanger with the pump (Iwaki magnet pump MD-15R-220N, Tokyo, Japan) connected to the double wall of the reactor. Temperature in the sludge bed was measured with a thermometer (TES 1320 ty pe-K, Taiwan). Methane 
production was measured by a wet-test gas meter (Meterfaried, Dord recht, The Netherlands) at 20 
oC 
after the biogas had been led through a NaOH solution (10% w/w) and a column of soda lime pillets with indicator (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The main flow was provided with a peristatic pump (Watson Marlow 501 U, Falmouth, Cornwakk, UK) pumping tap water of 30-31 
oC, to which concentrated feed 
stock solution was supplied with a separate peristatic pump (Gilson-Minipuls 3, Villiers-Le-Bel, France). 
Recirculation of the effluent was imposed to the system by a peristatic pump (Wason Marlow 502 S, Falmouth, Corwall, UK), enabling the desired expansion of the sludge bed in the reactor. Tap water, feed stock solution and recirculation flow were combined before entering the reactor. 
2.3 Medium 
The reactor was fed with a concentrated stock 
solution of 30.0 g chemical oxygen demand (COD). The substrate consisted of a partly neutralized (pH = 6.5) mixture of volatile fatty acid (VFA) composed of acetate, propionate and butyrate at the ratio of 1:1.5:1.8, based on COD. The concentrations of basal nutrient in the concentrated stock solution were (g L

resazurin, 200; HCl 36%, 1 mL L-1. All chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck 
(Darmstadt, Germany). 
2.4 Start-up of the Reactor 
Feeding of the reactor was started immediately after 
inoculation with the mesophilic granular sludge , at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 15-20 g COD L
-1d-1 
and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1.2 h. From the start of the experiment the temperature of the reactor was set at 30 
oC. During the continuous 
operation of the reactor, the samples of influent and effluent were taken three times per week in duplicate. 
2.5 Batch Experiment 
2.5.1 Anaerobic Sulfate Reduction Assay 
The batch anaerobic assays  were conducted in 120 
mL glass serum flasks. The basal medium used in the bioassay was (g L
-1): NH 4Cl, 2.8, CaCl 2, 0.047, 
K2HPO 4, 2.5, MgCl 27H2O, 5.0 with 50 mL 
micronutrient. Predigested granular sludge (1.5 g VSSL
-1) was transferred to seru m flasks containing 5 
ml of the basal medium, 45 mL NaHCO 3 solution (5 
gL-1) and 1 mL of VFA (85 g COD L-1, C2:C3:C4 = 
1:1:1 based on COD) from neutralized stock to yield a final concentration of 1.5 g of COD L
-1. The serum 
flasks were sealed with 12 mm thick butyl rubber stoppers (Rubber B.V., Hilversum, The Netherlands) and flushed with 70% N
2-30% CO 2 gas for 5 minutes 
and incubated with shaking (50 rpm) overnight in a temperature control room at 30 
oC for two days to 
allow for biological consumption of residual O 2. 
After two days of incubation, the serum flasks were 
fed with 1 mL of VFA and 1 mL of Na 2SO 4 to ensure 
the concentration of sulfate in the serum bottles about 2 gL
-1 and flushed with 70% N 2-30% CO 2 gas for 5 
minutes. The sulfide concentration in the solution of each serum flask was monito red periodically during 
the assay. Sludge blanks, to correct for background sulfide production from the sludge, were based on assays where no sulfate compound were provided. Sulfide concentration was calculated by substracting Enhanced Anaerobic Treatment of Textile Wastewater by Chemical Additive

background sulfide production in the control from that 
in the test vials. All data are the average of triplicate 
run experiments. 
2.5.2 Anaerobic Decolorisation Assay The basal medium, sludge, and procedure to carry 
out the assay are similar to those which were mentioned above. After two days incubation the serum flasks were fed with 1 mL of VFA, 1 mL of Direct Red 81 (DR81) concentration 200 mg L
-1, 1 
mL of adding compound (SO 4, S2-, Anthraquinone 
2-sulfonic acid) provided and flushed with 70% N 2-30% 
CO 2 gas for 5 minutes. All data are the average of 
triplicate run experiments. The absorbance of DR81 was monitored periodically (0-10 hour) during the assay. The absorbance was transferred to the concentration by the calibr ation curve. The initial 
reduction rate was calculated based on linear part of the graph, omitting the lag phase. 
3. Analyses 
3.1 Sulfide 
Sulfide was measured colorimetrically, using a 
method adapted from Ref. [8]. 
3.2 Sulphate 
Sulphate were determined according to standard 
methods [1]. 
3.3 Wave Length 
Wave length at maximum absorbance was defined 
by scanning the Direct Red 81 sample with spectrophotometer at wave length 509 nm. 
3.4 Absorbance 
The absorbance at 509 nm was measured with a 
spectronic 60 spectrophotometer (Milton Roy/Analytical Products Division, Ostende, Belgium) and a model 100-QS (Hellma Benelux, The Hague, The Netherlands) 1-cm quartz cuvette. All samples were diluted to less than 0.9 absorbance units in 0.2M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).  4. Results 
4.1 Anaerobic Sulfate Reduction Assay 
The result of anaerobic sulfate reduction assay was 
showed in Fig. 2. The lag phase was about 1.2 days, ang then the rate incr eased to 60 g/hour. 
Different concentration of sulfate was used to 
assess the effect of sulfate on the decolorization rate of DR81. The sulfate concentration in the bottles were 0 (blank), 0.02, 0.20, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00 g L
-1 and 0.0, 
0.001, 0.005, 0.010, 0.020, 0.04 g L-1. The results 
showed that there is no si gnificant effect of sulfate 
concentration on th e decolorization rate of DR81, not 
only at low concentration (Fig. 4) but also at high concentration of sulfate (Fig. 3). 
4.2 Anaerobic Decolorisation Assay with the Presence 
of Anthroquinone-2-sulfonic acid (AQS) 
There is no clearly effect of AQS on the 
decolorization rate of DR81 (Fig. 5).  
4.3 Anaerobic Decolorisation Assay with the Presence 
of Sulfide 
Different 
 concentration  of  sulfide  was  used to 
assess the effect of sulfid e on the decolorization rate 
of DR81. The sulfide concentration in the bottles were 0 (blank), 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.20 g L
-1. To evaluate the 
importance  of  biological  action  and  chemical 
reduction on the decolorization rate of DR81, the sterilized sludge and the samp les without sludge were 
introduced. 
 The  results  showed  that  there is a 
significant effect of sulfide on the decolorization rate of DR81 (Fig. 5). At low concentration of Sulfide

5. Conclusion 
 Sulfate and anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid have 
no significant effect on the decolorization rate of DR81; 
 Sulfide has positive effect on decolorization rate 
of DR81; 
 At HRT = 1.6 hour and the DR81 influence 
concentration = 80 mg/L, th e removal efficiency can 
reach at 90%; 
 If sulfide was added to 200 mg/L in the influent,
