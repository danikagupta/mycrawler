The selective pressure on a protein-coding gene can be
measured by comparing silent (synonymous) and replacement(nonsynonymous) substitution rates. Higher replacement thansilent rates provide unequivocal evidence for adaptive evolutiondriven by Darwinian selection. Previous employment of thiscriterion involved pairwise sequence comparison, averagingrates over time and sequences, resulting in virtually no power.Recent methods apply the criterion to particular lineages on aphylogeny or to individual sites in the gene and are much morepowerful. Their application has led to detection of adaptiveDarwinian selection in a number of genes and organisms.

Introduction
The relative importance of mutation and selection to 
molecular evolution has been a matter of debate for overthirty years. The neutral theory [1,2] claims that mostobserved molecular variation — both polymorphism withinspecies and divergence between species — is not due tonatural selection driving the fixation of advantageousmutations but to random fixation of selectively neutralmutations which confer no fitness advantage. Several testsof the neutral theory have been developed in populationgenetics [3,4,5
••] and have been applied successfully to
identify the footprints of positive selection from genome-wideanalysis of within-species polymorphism [6,7]. Interpretationsof such neutrality tests, however, are seldom unequivocaland often depend on assumptions about populationdemography and details of the selection model [5
••,8].
A more stringent and robust criterion for detecting adaptive
evolution in a protein-coding gene is an accelerated non-synonymous ( d
N, amino acid replacing) rate relative to the
synonymous ( dS, silent) rate of substitution, with the rate
ratio ω=dN/dS>1. As silent mutations do not change the
amino acid whereas replacement mutations do, the differ-ence in their fixation rates provides a measure of selectivepressure on the protein. Because silent and replacementsites are interspersed in the same segment of the DNA, theeffects of factors such as population size changes will beshared, providing a natural control [8,9]. T raditionally, 
synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates aredefined in the context of comparing two DNA sequences,with d
Nto be the number of nonsynonymous substitutions
per nonsynonymous site and dSto be the number of 
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site [10]. Thus,if an amino acid change is neutral, it will be fixed at thesame rate as a synonymous mutation, with 
ω= 1. If the
amino acid change is deleterious, purifying selection willreduce its fixation rate so that 
ω<1. When the amino acid
change offers a selective advantage, it will be fixed at ahigher rate than a synonymous mutation, with 
ω>1.
Purifying selection is rather easy to detect, and so the focusof my review is adaptive Darwinian selection indicated by
ω>1. (See [11•] for a more mathematical treatment.)
Early studies took an approach of pairwise sequence 
comparison and tested whether dN–dSis significantly
greater than 0. This approach in effect averages substitutionrates over all amino acid sites in the sequence and over thetime interval separating the two sequences. As most aminoacid sites are expected to be highly conserved and adaptiveevolution most likely affects only a few sites at a few timepoints [12], this approach has virtually no power to detectpositive selection (e.g. [3]). For example, a large-scaledatabase search identified only 17 proteins out of 3,595 aslikely to be under positive selection, at a proportion of only0.47% [13]. Indeed a very interesting use of such compar-isons is to predict protein-coding regions in genomic DNA,making use of the fact that in virtually every gene, d
Nis
significantly smaller than dS[14]. Recent methodological
developments have largely remedied this problem of pairwise comparison.
Adaptive molecular evolution is at least partly responsible
for evolutionary innovations and species divergences and isthus fundamentally important for understanding genome-scale evolution. Besides gaining a better understanding offorces and mechanisms of molecular evolution, identifyingproteins or protein domains undergoing adaptive changesis also important for understanding gene function.Although it is well known that evolutionarily conservedregions of a protein are functionally important [15], it is nottrue that variable regions are all junk DNA. If the variabilitycan be shown to be driven by positive Darwinian selection,functional importance is established.
Lineage-specific episodes of Darwinian selection
In an analysis of lysozyme evolution in primates, Messierand Stewart [16] inferred DNA sequences in extinct ancestral species and used them to calculate d
Nand dSfor
each branch in the phylogeny. Positive selection along abranch is identified by testing whether d
N>dS, using a
normal approximation to the statistic dN–dS. By focusingInference of selection from multiple species alignments

on a single branch, the approach avoids averaging over 
long time periods, and it identified two lineages under positive selection. 
Zhang et al. [17,18] were concerned about the reliability 
of the normal approximation and suggested the use ofFisher’s exact test applied to counts of differences. (Anexample is presented later in this section.) This approachmay suffer from several problems. First, reconstructedancestral sequences are not real data and involve systematicbiases and random errors [19]. Second, the methods usedto estimate substitution rates along each branch are typi-cally simplistic and do not account for features of sequenceevolution such as different transition and transversion ratesor codon usage bias. A common mistake made in using this approach is to apply the test to all branches in the phylogeny, in which case multiple tests are performed onthe same data so that the significance values are incorrect.
The first two problems can be circumvented by taking a like-
lihood approach under a codon-substitution model [20,21]. Inthe likelihood calculation, the 
ωratio can be assumed to be
different among branches of the tree. Thus the hypothesisthat a lineage of interest is under the same selective pressureas other lineages can be tested by comparing two models, oneassuming the same 
ωratio for all lineages and the other
assuming a different ωfor the lineages of interest [21].
Similarly, the likelihood ratio test can be used to test whetherthe 
ωratio for the lineages of interest is significantly >1.
Here I use the data of Merritt and Quattro [22] from the
triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) gene family in fishes.TPI is a dimeric glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the 
interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate and is central to carbohydratemetabolism. In all jawed vertebrates, a single neutrally-charged TPI protein is expressed. However, in teleost fish,two TPI proteins are found: the neutrally charged and generally expressed B form and the negatively chargedderived A form that is found in neurons (eyes and brain).Merritt and Quattro [22] sequenced the TPI-codingcDNAs from two teleost fish species, southern platy andzebrafish, as well as the single gene (B form) in the moreprimitive fish shortnose sturgeon (see Figure 1). Theauthors performed an analysis of adaptive evolution aftergene duplication along branch Ain Figure 1 using the
method of Messier and Stewart [16] and Zhang et al. [17].
The empirical Bayes approach of Yang et al. [19] was used
to reconstruct amino acid sequences for ancestral nodes,with branch lengths estimated using least squares [17].The coding DNA sequences for ancestral nodes were then inferred according to the reconstructed amino acidsequences. The reconstruction suggested n= 23 nonsyn-
onymous changes and s= 1 synonymous change along
branch A, whereas the numbers of nonsynonymous and
synonymous sites in the sequence were calculated to beN= 536 and S= 196. Use of Fisher’s exact test [17] suggested
a significant excess of nonsynonymous changes alongbranch A, with P= 0.005.
T o illustrate the bias in ancestral sequence reconstruction
and to examine the sensitivity of the analysis to modelassumptions, I analyze the same data using maximum likelihood under models of codon substitution [21]. TheFigure 1

The branch lengths aremeasured by the expected number ofnucleotide substitutions per codon, estimatedunder the free-ratio model which estimatesone 
ω for each branch. The numbers along
each branch are the likelihood estimates ofnonsynonymous and synonymous changes(n*/s*) under the same model. Estimates
under other models are listed in Table 1 forbranch A.0.1

results are shown in T able 1. The one-ratio models (A-C)
assume the same ωratio for all branches and are used to
demonstrate the effects of transition/transversion bias andcodon usage bias on calculation of the numbers of synonymous ( S) and nonsynonymous ( N) sites. Ignoring
the transition/transversion rate bias is well known to causean underestimate of synonymous sites S[23]. Ignoring
base composition bias has the opposite effect, and leads to overestimation of S[24]. The base compositions at the
third codon position are 21% for T, 31% for C, 14% for A,and 33% for G. The high GC content means that mostchanges at the third position are transversions between Gand C, which are more likely to be nonsynonymous thanare random changes between the four nucleotides. Whenboth biases are accounted for, the expected numbers ofsites are N= 557.8 and S= 180.2.
The one-ratio models also highlight the differences between
the likelihood estimates of changes ( n* and s*) and the counts
from the reconstructed ancestral sequences ( nand s), even if
both are from the same analysis. For example, when no codonusage bias and no transition/transversion bias are assumed(model A, T able 1), the likelihood estimates suggest aboutn* = 14 nonsynonymous substitutions and s* = 70 synony-
mous substitutions along branch A in the tree of Figure 1,whereas the corresponding numbers from ancestral recon-struction are n= 21 and s= 35. Similarly, large differences are
observed for other branches in the tree (T able 1). The recon-struction approach does not correct for multiple hits within thebranch, and might be expected to underestimate the numberof substitutions. Although the method indeed underestimatessynonymous changes, it surprisingly overestimates nonsyn-onymous changes. Thus, counts of differences ( nand s) from
reconstructed sequences are unreliable pseudo-data whereascounts of sites ( Nand S) are affected by codon usage bias; as a
result, Fisher’s exact test based on those counts is not exact.
T o test for positive directional selection along branch A, 
I consider two models. The ‘three-ratios’ model assumestwo independent 
ωratios for branches Aand B(Figure 1),
whereas all other branches have the same ratio ω0. The
‘free-ratios’ model assumes an independent ωfor each
branch on the phylogeny. Estimates of ωAunder the three-
ratios models are several times higher than ω0for other
branches. Nevertheless, the estimates are less than one,and thus the evidence for positive selection is not clear-cut (T able 1). Under the free-ratios model, 
ωAis estimated
to be infinity, with 21 nonsynonymous changes and 0 synonymous changes along the branch. However, fittingthe free-ratios model with 
ωA= 1 fixed (last row, T able 1)
reduces the log likelihood by only 0.5. Thus the nullhypothesis 
ωA= 1 cannot be rejected, with P= 0.75.
The difference in the ωAestimate between the 3-ratios and
free-ratios models is surprising as both models allow ωAto
vary freely. In previous analyses, those models were noted toproduce similar estimates for the common parameters (e.g. [21,25]). However, the TPI gene sequences are quitedivergent and at some codon sites, all three positions are dif-ferent either between the zebrafish and southern platy at theA locus or between the A and B loci. Ancestral reconstructionat those sites is unreliable, especially concerning distribu-tions of synonymous changes. The sensitivity of maximumlikelihood estimates to model assumptions indicates a similar lack of information in the data. Thus, the statisticalsupport from the sequence data for positive selection is notunequivocal, and the accelerated nonsynonymous rate alongbranch A is compatible with both positive selection andrelaxation of functional constraints (purifying selection)(T able 1). However, both the A and B forms of TPI are clearlyfunctional, and their biochemical differences [22] suggestthat positive selection is a more likely explanation.Sequencing more teleost fish species to break the longbranches in the tree will likely settle the issue.

NB, p is the number of parameters in the model including 17 branch lengths (Figure 1) and /G01 is the transition/transversion rate ratio. The
numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes along branch A are calculated as n* = dN × N and s* = dS × S, where N and S are the
numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, respectively. n and s are counts of differences from the reconstructed ancestral
sequences, which are inferred using the Empirical Bayes method [19] under the codon model. The Fequal model ignores codon usage  bias
and assumes equal frequency for each sense codon (1/61), whereas F3x4 calculates expected codon frequencies using the nucleotid e
frequencies at the three codon positions.Inference of selection from multiple species alignments Yang    691
and effectively average the ωratio across all sites. Positive
selection is detected for a lineage only if that average isgreater than one. This is a very conservative test of positiveselection, because many sites might be under strong purifying selection owing to functional constraint, with the
ωratio close to zero.
If prior information is available about which amino acid
residues are potentially under positive selection, attentioncan be focused on them. The best-known example isHughes and Nei’s [26] analysis of the MHC alleles, wherethe protein 3-D structure was used to identify amino acid residues at the antigen recognition site (ARS).Positive selection was detected for those sites but not forthe whole gene. Those results were confirmed in a recentlikelihood analysis, using so-called fixed-sites models thatassign and estimate separate 
ωratios for ARS and non-ARS
codons [27•].
When such information is unavailable, several approaches
can still be used. One is the sliding window analysis (e.g. [13]). The d
Nand dSrates are calculated for a sliding
window and regions with higher dNthan dScan be identified.
Even this method often lacks power, as positively selectedsites may be interspersed among highly conserved sites inthe sequence [28]. It would be more sensible if we couldslide the window on the protein tertiary structure ratherthan along the primary sequence. Thus the focus has beenon methods designed to detect selection at individualsites. Fitch et al. [29] used parsimony to reconstruct 
ancestral DNA sequences and counted changes at eachcodon site along branches of the tree. They tested whetherthe proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions at each siteis greater than the average over the sequence. Suzuki andGojobori [28] took a similar approach. They estimated thenumbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites and differences along the tree using reconstructed ancestralsequences at each site. They then tested whether the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions differed fromthe neutral expectation (
ω= 1). When the data contain
many similar sequences, these methods are useful tools forexploratory data analysis but the use of reconstructedancestral sequences and the simplistic assumptions madein the counting of sites and differences make hypothesistesting unreliable [11

the structure file 1AKJ in Protein Data Bank (chain A). From [27•].692 Genomes and evolution
In the likelihood method, it is not advisable to estimate one
ωratio parameter for each site. Instead, a statistical distrib-
ution is used to describe the variation of ωamong sites
[30,31]. Since ωis a measure of selective pressure on the
protein, these models account for variable selective pressuresamong sites.  However, such random-sites models make noprior assumption about which sites might be under positiveselection. T o test for positive selection, that is, the presenceof sites at which 
ω>1, we compare two statistical distribu-
tions. The null model uses a distribution that does notallow for sites with 
ω>1 whereas the more-general alterna-
tive model does. One such pair consists of models M7(beta) and M8 (beta&
ω) [31]. The beta distribution (M7) is
rather flexible but is limited to the range 0 <ω<1 and thus
serves as the null model. Model M8 adds an additional siteclass that has an 
ωfreely estimated from the data and can
thus be >1. The null and alternative models can be 
compared by a likelihood-ratio test to see whether allowingfor sites under positive selection provides a significantimprovement to the fit of the model to data. Over a dozensuch distributions were implemented [31].
When parameter estimates under the alternative model
(such as M8) suggest the presence of sites with 
ω>1,
Bayes theorem can be used to calculate the posterior prob-ability that each site is from that site class, and sites havinghigh probabilities are potential targets of positive selection.An example is shown in Figure 2, where posterior proba-bilities are plotted along the MHC sequence, highlightingsites that are potentially under diversifying selection [27
•].
The model identified 25 sites to be under positive selec-tion at the 95% probability level, out of which 22 are in theantigen recognition site while 3 are nearby. The model wasable to distinguish which of the 57 amino acid residues atthe antigen recognition site were truly under diversifyingselection and which of them are actually highly conserved.These studies appear very useful in generating hypothesesfor laboratory investigation because they could identifycrucial amino acids whose changes have offered a selectiveadvantage in Nature’s grand evolutionary experiment.
Note that the likelihood ratio test answers the simple
question of whether the sequence has sites under positiveselection with 
ω>1, while Bayes calculation of posterior
probabilities is used to pinpoint such sites. The latter isclearly a much more difficult task than the former as theremay not be enough information to allow inference at everysite. Because the information for such inference comesfrom synonymous and nonsynonymous changes at individualsites, the most important factors affecting performance arethe number of sequences and the level of sequence diver-gence. Those intuitive expectations have been confirmedby computer simulations [32,33
•]. Indeed, the likelihood
ratio test was found to perform well even in small datasets[32]. By contrast, Bayes identification of those sites underpositive selection performed poorly when the data contained a few highly similar sequences although perfor-mance increased dramatically with the inclusion of moresequences and more sequence divergence. Furthermore,
both the likelihood ratio test of positive selection and theBayes identification of sites under selection were found tobe highly inaccurate for within-species data due to lack ofvariability. In population data, recombination is also a con-cern, the effects of which are not yet well understood [33
•].
While the likelihood method [30,31] enjoys a better 
statistical justification than methods based on ancestralreconstruction [28,29], it should be emphasized that bothmethods make use of similar information in the data andrequire multiple moderately divergent sequences for reliable inference. In large datasets with many sequences,the two methods may be expected to locate similar sites[34,35]. In smaller datasets, there may be insufficientchanges at any single site to suggest selection. The likeli-hood ratio test will then have more power to detect thepresence of positive selection as it combines evidence overmany sites.
Application and performance in real data
The methods reviewed here appear to be conservative.They detect selection only if d
Nis higher than dS, and
selection that does not cause excessive replacement substitutions may not be detected. Pairwise comparisonhas little power because it averages the 
ωratio over sites
and over time. Methods for detecting selection along lineages work only if the 
ωratio averaged over all sites is
>1. Similarly, tests of positive selection at sites work only 
if the ωratio averaged over all branches is >1. Adaptive 
evolution that occurs only during a short time interval andthat affects only a few crucial amino acids may not bedetected by any of these methods.
In this regard the success of these methods has been
remarkable. The lineage-based analysis has been used todetect positive selection indicated by a burst of replacementsubstitutions along particular lineages of a phylogeny. Recentexamples include directional selection in pheromone-binding proteins along moth lineages in which pheromonechanges have occurred [36]; adaptive evolution in thebreast cancer gene BRCA1 in the human and chimpanzeelineages [37]; adaptive evolution of hemoglobins inAntarctic teleost fish (Notothenioids) at subzero temperature[38]; and positive selection in transferrin, an iron-bindingprotein, in salmonids, probably due to competition for ironfrom pathogenic bacteria [39]. The lineage-based methodsare particularly useful in analysis of gene-family evolutionto demonstrate the role of positive selection driving func-tional divergence after gene duplication [18,25,40,41].
Nevertheless, averaging substitution rates over sites
appears to be a more serious problem than averaging overlineages. As a result, models accounting for variable selectivepressures among sites [30,31] appear even more successful,detecting positive selection even in a background of over-whelming purifying selection. A large number of genesinvolved in host-pathogen or host-parasite antagonismInference of selection from multiple species alignments Yang    693
have thus been identified to contain sites under positive
selection [31,42–47,48•,49]. In such systems, an evolutionary
arms race appears to be going on, causing accelerated replace-ment substitution rates at amino acid residues involved in
the recognition in either the host or the pathogen or parasite. An interesting example concerns the evolution ofthe wsp gene among Wolbachia bacteria, thought to be
involved in host-parasite interactions. The bacterial genewas found to be under diversifying selection when the bacteria have an antagonistic relationship with its hosts(arthropods) while not when the bacteria have a mutualisticrelationship with its hosts (nematode worms) [50]. Severalstudies have also identified positive selection involved insperm-egg recognition [51] or other aspects of male orfemale reproduction [52–56], providing molecular evidencefor the evolutionary battle of the sexes.
Conclusions
An accelerated replacement rate over silent rate is a verystringent criterion for detecting adaptive molecular evolu-tion. Yet, methods focused on selection in a short period oftime or at individual sites have enjoyed much successwhen applied to real data analysis. With the fast accumulationof DNA sequences, more exciting cases of adaptive molecular evolution are bound to be found. We are now ata position to search genome-wide for molecular Darwinismand to answer questions such as what proportion of proteins are evolving under the influence of positiveDarwinian selection. Such studies not only advance ourunderstanding of the mechanisms of molecular evolutionbut also provide insights into protein function.

This paper uses a dataset of 192 class I MHC alleles from humans to compare the fixed-sites models, which use structural information to partitionthe ARS and non-ARS codons, and the random-sites models. The analysisdemonstrated the surprising power of the random-sites fishing-expeditionmodels, which were able to distinguish codons at the ARS truly under positive selection from those that are actually highly conserved.
