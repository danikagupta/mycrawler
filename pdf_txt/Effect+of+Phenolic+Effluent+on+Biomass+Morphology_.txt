INTRODUCTION  
 
 Algae encompass a wide range of organisms, comprising over 30,000 species 
from various phylogenetic groups. They are typically categorized into multicellular 
macroalgae and unicellular microalgae. Microa lgae consist  of single -celled organisms, 
but it is crucial to acknowledge the remarkable heterogeneity observed within the algae 
kingdom ( Ariede et al.,  2017 ). Algae represent eukaryotes' most abundant photosynthetic 
organisms ( Anastopoulos & Kyzas, 2015 ) that play a crucial role in supporting life.  ARTICLE INFO  ABSTRACT

Bioremediation  The elevated concentrations of phenolic compounds in effluent have 
significant detrimental effects on aquatic organisms, posing a notable 
environmental concern. Algae -based remediation of organic wastewater has 
gained substantial attention due to its cost -effectiveness, efficiency, and 
environmental compatibility. Industrial processes, notably petroleum 
processing, are major sources of phenolic compounds, emphasizing the 
urgency for their remediation. Conventional wastewater treatment methods 
are costly and may contribute to secondary pollution, necessitating the 
development of advanced techniques to mitigate the adverse impacts of 
insufficiently treated phenolics. Algae of fer environmentally friendly 
processes such as adsorption, bioaccumulation, biodegradation, and 
photodegradation for phenolic bioremediation.  Additionally, algae possess 
carbon fixation capabilities and the potential to produce high -value 
products, thus en hancing the economic feasibility of algal wastewater 
remediation t echnology. This review evaluated  the ecological consequences 
of various phenolic pollutants in effluent and explore d diverse approaches to 
mitigate them, including the optimiz ation of  bioremediation processes. 
Furthermore, the article examined the progress in understanding the 
mechanisms involved in phenol removal using algae. , this technology 
exhibits considerable promise, and further research is required to practically 
implement indu strial -scale wastewater remediation.  Younis et al.,  2023  1134  
 Phytoplankton, a type of microalgae, can be found in diverse ecosystems ( Wang 
et al.,  2015; Bwapwa et al. , 2017 ). Algae are further classified based on colo r, with 
brown, red, and green algae being the mo st prevalent types. There are remarkably more 
than fifty edible algae species ( Wang et al.,  2019 ). 
 In recent years, there has been a growing interest in utilizing microalgae in 
cosmetics, particularly for their moisturizing properties and potential to tre at skin 
degeneration, sunburn, and pigment d isorders. Microalgae have gained attention in 
cosmetics due to their potential to develop anti -ageing, whitening, and pigmentation -
reducing products ( Wang et al.,  2015 ). Moreover, microalgae exhibit the ability t o 
generate oxygen necessary for the degradation of various pollutants, including phenol, 
pharmaceuticals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organic solvents ( Peng et al.,  
2014; Gentili & Fick, 2017; Xiong et al., 2018 ). 
 Cyanobacteria and microalgae ha ve demonstrated remarkable adaptability 
throughout evolutionary history, enabling them to utilize renewable energy sources such 
as solar energy and adapt to autotrophic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic culture conditions 
(Subashchandrabose et al.,  2013 ). Alt hough the utilization of microalgae in the 
biodegradation process was initially proposed by Oswald and Gotaas ( Papazi et al.,  
2012 ), there has been a recent surge of interest within the scientific community.  
 The degradation/ deterioration of surface water  has emerged as a prominent 
concern within environmental issues ( Younis, 2019; Taher et al.,  2023) . Globally, two 
significant and persistent sources of pollution threaten water quality. The first is the 
presence of high concentrations of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems, leading to 
organic contamination and eutrophication. The second is the pollution caused by various 
sources, resulting in the discharge of organic compounds into rivers, lakes, and oceans 
(Hanafy et al.,  2021; Younis et al., 2022) . This organic pollution originates from 
agricultural water, industrial effluents, urban discharge, and sewage, ultimately impacting 
water quality and limiting its usability for diverse purposes ( Amin et al.,  2018; Younis, 
2020) . 
 Organic pollution can have detri mental effects on water quality through various 
mechanisms ( El-Naggar et al.,  2021; Younis et al.,  2023) . Among the numerous 
chemicals of concern, p henol stands out as one of the 129 chemicals with specific 
significance. It is considered toxic under the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1977,  and 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established water quality standards for 
its regulation ( Kumar, 2011 ). Phenol is an aromatic hydrocarbon with an OH group 
attached to the benzene ring. It serves as a funda mental structural unit for numerous 
synthetic organic compounds. Being an organic substance, phenol is soluble in most 1135                         Heavy Metals in Sediments of the Mangrove Ecosystem in Ras Mohammed Protectorate, Red Sea  
 
 organic solvents and exhibits mild solubility in water at room temperature ( Agarry, 
2008 ). 
 As ma jor environmental pollutants, ph enols c an exist as natural or synthetic 
nonaromatic compounds in various environments. Due to its aromatic structure, p henol is 
inherently resistant to biodegradation, and phenolic compounds are known for their high 
stability, primarily due to the challenge of be nzene ring cleavage.  
 Initially discovered in 1841 by the German scientist Ferdinand Runge (Tyman, 
1996) , phenol occurs naturally in coal tar. It represents one of the most prevalent 
pollutants discharged by various industries, including plastics manufactu ring, oil 
refineries, dye and pesticide production, and the pharmaceutical sector. Phenol (C 6H5OH) 
serves as the fundamental building block of phenolic compounds. These compounds are 
characterized by organic substances featuring one or more aromatic rings with a hydroxyl 
group (-OH) attached. Moreover, p henol is  known as hydroxybenzene, benzophenol, and 
carbolic acid  (Anku et al.,  2017) . Other significant phenolic compounds include 
butylhydroxytoluene, nonylphenol, methyl phenols, alkylphenols, aminop henols, 
nitrophenols, chlorophenols, and bisphenol A.  
 Phenolic compounds can be produced as byproducts in the course of produce 
processing activities. For instance, during the mass production of olive oil, a substantial 
volume of water is employed for fr uit washing and machine cleaning following the 
processing stage.  Depending on the specific extraction method employed, the production 
of olive oil can generate wastewater ranging from 10 to 120 litres per 100 kilograms of 
olives (Dermeche et al.,  2013) . This wastewater has been reported to contain phenolic 
concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 grams per lit er (Faraloni et al., 2011; Di Capri  et 
al., 2018) .  
 Given that phenolic compounds possess toxicity toward  various organisms 
(Fiorentino et al.,  2003) , it is crucial to prevent their release into the environment and, if 
possible, find effective ways to utilize these compounds. Obied et al. (2005)  identified 
ten significant phenolic compounds in OMW, characterized by intricate chemical 
structures and notabl e functional ities. These compounds include tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 
oleuropein, rutin, catechol, vanillic acid, p -coumaric acid, caffeic acid, elenolic acid, and 
verbascoside. Their environmental toxicity primarily arises from their antimicrobial 
propertie s.  
 The remediation of water contaminated with phenolic pollutants presents a 
challenge due to the diverse origins and variable concentrations of these chemicals 
resulting from various industrial processes. The high solubility of phenolic compounds in 
water and their limited biodegradability can lead to significant detrimental effects when Younis et al.,  2023  1136  
present in wastewater (Massalha et al.,  2010; Subramaniam et al.,  2020) . 
Consequently, numerous wastewater treatment methods have been developed to eliminate 
phenolic ch emicals from municipal, industrial, and domestic effluents. It is crucial to 
devise strategies that mitigate p henol's harmful impacts on aquatic organisms and human 
well-being. The escalating levels of water pollution necessitate the development of 
sustain able approaches to restore environmental balance by addressing the issue of 
phenolic contaminants. Recently, there has been a growing emphasis on ecologically 
friendly solutions aimed at combating water pollution and restoring equilibrium within 
the aquati c ecosystem (Wu et al.,  2010; Wu et al., 2011) . 
 Various effective methods exist for removing hydrocarbons and phenols, such as 
chemical oxidation, ion exchange, activated carbon adsorption, and liquid -liquid 
extraction. However, these approaches often hav e significant drawbacks, including high 
costs and potential harmful side effects. Moreover, most of these methods merely transfer 
the organic chemicals to a different phase rather than breaking them down, generating 
hazardous byproducts and secondary pollu tion. In contrast, biodegradation is considered 
a more economically viable and environmentally friendly alternative. Consequently, 
biological treatment has emerged as a crucial step in the battle against pollution ( Younis 
et al.,  2019 ). 
 Many microorganism s possess the ability to tolerate p henol and utilize it as a 
carbon and energy source. The biological degradation occurs through the cleavage of the 
benzene ring, facilitated by specific enzymes produced by these microorganisms (Feng et 
al., 2011) . This en zymatic breakdown allows for the efficient removal of phenolic 
compounds, contributing to the remediation of contaminated environments. Harnessing 
the potential of microbial degradation offers a promising avenue for sustainable and eco -
friendly pollution c ontrol.  
 The employment of algae in bio -removal processes offers several advantages, 
including (a) cost -effective production and maintenance, (b) utilization of readily 
available and inexpensive energy through photosynthesis, (c) production of high -value 
products, (d) growth facilitated by inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, and (e) the 
potential for algal biomass reproduction for biofuel production ( Voloshin et al.,  2016; 
Papazi et al.,  2019 ).  
 Algae play a vital role in a process known as phycoremediatio n, which involves 
the detoxification of chemically contaminated water (Phang et al.,  2015) . One significant 
advantage of this method is that it ensures the absence of harmful substances being 
transported to treatment sites, thanks to the adsorption capabil ities of algae 
(Krishnamoorthy & Manickam, 2021) . Phycoremediation has gained prominence in 
environmental remediation due to algae's remarkable ability to absorb various hazardous 1137                         Heavy Metals in Sediments of the Mangrove Ecosystem in Ras Mohammed Protectorate, Red Sea  
 
 contaminants,  viz. heavy metals, phenols, aromatic hydrocarbons, a nd organochlorines, 
surpassing traditional physiochemical approaches (Ke et al.,  2012; Al-Jabri et al.,  2020 ; 
Soliman et al.,  2020; Younis et al.,  2020 ). The inherent capacity of algae to remove 
organic, metal, and nutrient components has made them invalua ble for wastewater 
treatment ( Laurens et al.,  2017; Mahana et al.,  2021 ). Interestingly, algae can utilize 
phenol as their sole carbon source ( Van Schie et al.,  2000; Krastanov et al.,  2013; Lee 
et al.,  2015 ). Among the non -pathogenic microalgae widely rec ognized for their efficacy 
in phycoremediation of phenolic compounds are Chlorella , Spirulina , Scenedesmus , and 
Chlamydomonas  species ( Brar et al.,  2017 ). Algae -based wastewater treatment systems 
are particularly suitable for widespread implementation and on-site oxygen generation 
(Garrett et al.,  2017 ). 
 Extensive research has been conducted to elucidate algae's breakdown of phenolic 
compounds. The mechanisms underlying this degradation process have been investigated, 
considering the factors influencing de gradation and highlighting the cellular 
modifications induced by excessive phenol exposure. This article present ed an overview 
of the latest advancements in algae -mediated removal of phenolic compounds, paving the 
way for future progress in this field.  
 Recent studies have indicated that algae exhibit the potenti al to metabolize and 
eliminate p henol and its derivatives. The efficacy of phenolic chemical removal by algae 
is influenced by various factors, including the type of algae or substrate employed, t he 
degradation rate, and the initial pH conditions. Algae displa y a limited tolerance range to 
phenol, and as the concentration of pollutants increases, the phenol degradation rate 
decreases. This decline can be attributed  to the heightened toxicity of p henol at higher 
concentrations, impacting cellular function.  
 Notably, algae offer a long -term protective shield for the environment against 
harmful substances. In this review, we  delve d into the mechanisms employe d by algae in 
the breakdown of p henol and explore d related topics in depth.  
Sources of p henol  
 Phenol can be synthesized through both chemical processes and natural pathways. 
The predominant method for synthetic phenol production globally is cumene oxidation, 
which accounts for approximately 9 5% of the total production. Various industrial sectors 
contribute to the generation of phenolic waste, including petroleum refineries, 
petrochemical plants, steel mills, coke oven facilities, coal gas production, synthetic resin 
manufacturing, paint and pl ywood industries, mine discharges, explosives production, 
rubber products manufacturing, textile industries, and the food and beverage sector ( Field Younis et al.,  2023  1138  
& Lettinga, 1991; Aggelis et al.,  2002; Zhang et al.,  2017; Kadir et al.,  2018; Lellis et 
al., 2019 ).   
Table (1) displays  detailed informati on on the specific sources of ph enol.  
Phenol serves multiple purposes  including its use as a chemical analysis reagent and 
disinfectant. In addition, i t can  enter the environment through automobile exhaust, with a 
population of 580,000 individuals residing in the United States alone ( Bruce et al., 1987 ). 
Phenol exposure is prevalent among individuals working in industries where it is utilized.  
 Chemical processes c ontribute to the production of p henol, which can occur  
through various pathways. One such pat hway involves the formation of p henol during the 
condensation of water vapo r, leading to cloud formation in the atmosphere. Additionally, 
hydroxybenzene is generated through organic processes , such as plant biosynthe sis and 
the breakdown of organic matter. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure can produce p henol 
from amino acids in plant hemicelluloses ( Davi et al.,  1996 ). Furthermore, tyrosine 
modification in the digestive tracts of mammals  including humans  can gener ate p henol 
(Tsuru et al.,  1996 ).

  The phenol content in surface water exhibits variability. In undisturbed marine 
environments, the range typic ally falls between 0.01 and 2.0 µg/L ( Mich Ałowicz & 
Duda, 2004 ). However, water bodies exposed to higher levels of anthropogenic pollution 
may contain elevated phenol concentrations. For instance, surface water in the 
Netherlands has phenol concentrations ranging from 2.6 to 5.6µg/L, while ri ver water 
contaminated with refinery sewage can h ave phenol content exceeding 40 mg/ L (Bruce 
et al.,  1987 ). In addition, p henol has  been detected in residential water supplies in the 
United States,  albeit at a lower level of 1.0 µg/ L. In the air, bac kground lev els of p henol 
are expected to be modest, measuring only one ng/m3 (RIVM, 1986) . However, higher 
phenol concentrations can be found near facilities involved in wood impregnation,  
reaching levels as high as 9.7 µg/ m3 (Alle et al.,  1997) . 
 Phenol i s also present in various food items. Modest phenol concentrations 
(5µg/kg) have been detected in honey ( Gyroik et al.,  2003) . In coffee, p henol is produced 
from ferulic acid, resulting in its presence in the beverage. Corn, a natural substance, 
converts f rom ferulic acid to  guaiacol, vinyl -guaiacol, and p henol ( Dor Fner  et al.,  
2003 ). 
 Processed foods can sometimes cont ain dangerously high levels of p henol. For 
example, grilled sausage and pork have b een found to contain 7 and 28.6 µg/ kg of 
phenol, respect ively ( US EPA, 1980 ). Other studies have detected p henol in the outer 
layer of smoked meat at levels ranging from 37 to 70 mg/ kg. 
 Determining the extent of phenol exposure in the general population remains 
challenging due to insufficient exposure statisti cs. However, individuals regularly 
consuming smoked foods with high phenol content or inhaling air in heavily 
industrialized areas may be exposed to hazardous phenol l evels, estimated to be around 4  
and 2 mg daily, respectively. Furthermore, it has been c alculated that each burned 
cigarette  releases approximately 0.3 – 0.4mg of phenol. Accidental phenol exposure can 
also occur, as exemplified by Delfino and Dube, who reported a case of phenol 
contamination in groundwater used for human consumption. In this  scenario, it was 
estimated that each person would be exposed to 10 - 240mg of p henol daily, resulting in 
statistically significant symptoms , such as darkened urine, mouth ulcers, a burning 
sensation in the mouth, and diarrhoea ( Del Fino &  Dube, 1976 ). 
Phen olic p ollut ant types as identified by the U.S. E nvironmental Protection Agency 
(EPA)  
 Phenol pollutants originating from oil refineries are commonly detected in the 
wastewater they discharge. These pollutants can also be found in various sectors, such as 
coal processing, pharmaceutical industries, and petrochemicals ( Othmani et al., 2022; Younis et al.,  2023  1140  
Duan et al.,  2018) . The concentration of total phenols in wastewater typically ranges 
from 10 to 300 mg/ L.  
 The European Union (EU) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
have identified a list of priority chemicals, including nitrop henols and chlorophenols. 
Fig.( 1) illustrates eleven phenols that the EPA recognizes as significant pollutants. EU 
Directive 2455/2001/EC has estab lished a specified limit of 0.5 μg/ L for the total 
concentration of these phenols in drinking water, with a furth er requirement of less than 
0.1μg/ L. Al-Zuhair and Co. (2018)  emphasize d the criticality of addressing the 
presence of these contaminants, particularly phenolic compounds  in sewage -based 
wastewater. The chemical structures o f phenolic compounds vary, with p henol, cresol, 
and other related substances being frequently encountered in wastewater. In the 
supplementary materials, examples of such compounds include 2,  4, 6-trichloroph enol 
and 2,  4-dinitrophenol.  
 Phenol, the fundamental phenolic compound, is formed by the combination of a 
hydroxyl group (OH) and a benzene ring. It is commonly present in high concentrations 
in industrial wastewater, particularly from refineries. Some wa stewater streams exhibit 
phen ol concentrations as high as 10 g/ L (Krastanov et al.,  2013 ). According to Xiong et 
al. (2021) , phenol is highly carcinogenic, corrosive, and toxic. In wastewater, whe n the 
phenol content exceeds 50 mg/ L, the biodegradation rat e may be hindered ( Saputera et 
al., 2021 ). 
 Chlorophenols, the largest and most prevalent group of phenols, are primarily 
formed t hrough the chlorination of mono  and polyaromatic compounds present in soil 
and water. This environmental synthesis of chloroph enols involves the participation of 
chloroperoxidases found in plants and microbes, facilitated by the presence of inorganic 
chlorine and hydrogen peroxide. Notably, certain species of the Hypholoma  fungus  such 
as the Hypholoma genera  produc e chlorinated phenols ( Sw Arts et al.,  1998;  Verh Age  
et al.,  1998). Chlorophenol concentrations in oceanic wate rs typically range from 5 to 
10ng/ L, while river waters exhibit higher lev els, varying between 2 and 2000 μg/ L. It is 
worth mentioning that , chlorophenols can also be found in drinking water due to the 
replacement of organic materials and low molecular weight compounds by chlorine 
atoms from inorganic chlorine oxidants, even after the water has undergone filt ration 
processes.  
 Pentachlorophenol (PCP), 2,4,5 -trichlorophenol (2,4,5 -TCP), and 2,4,6 -
trichlorophenol (2,4,6 -TCP) represent notable examples of chlorophenol pollutants that 
have been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as 
potentially carcinogenic to humans ( Cooper & Jones, 2008 ).  1141                         Heavy Metals in Sediments of the Mangrove Ecosystem in Ras Mohammed Protectorate, Red Sea  
 
 Methyl phenols are commonly detected in the environment, often occurring at high 
concentrations. An example can be seen in the Hayashida River located in Tatsuno town, 
Japan, where elevate d lev els of 4 -methylphenol (204 μg/L) were identified, primarily 
attributed to industrial effluent pollution. Areas adjacent to coal tar (creosote) 
manufacturing plants exhibit the highest levels of methyl phenols, with groundwater 
containing over 2 mg/ L of 4 -methylphenol. Some studies have also reported the presence 
of methylated phenols in the atmosphere.  
 Shale oils and rock oils commonly contain alkylphenols with low molecular 
weight. These chemicals, primarily substituted in the para position, arise from 
geochemical reactions occurring within geological formations, involving processes such 
as methylation, butylation, and alkylation ( Kahl et al.,  1997 ). Furthermore, certain 
technological processes also contribute to the formation of these chemicals. For exampl e, 
nonylphenols are generated by using surfactants known as nonylphenol ethoxylates, 
which find applications in agriculture and various industries. Nonylphenols serve as 
dispersants, wetting agents, and emulsifiers. Industries involved in textile processin g, 
paper and pulp production, paint manufacturing, oil and resin production, and steel 
manufacturing utilize nonylphenol polyethoxylates. Additionally, alkylphenols can be 
produced through agricultural activities, industrial wastewater discharge, and the 
breakdown of pesticides (Berryman et al.,  2004 ). 
 Bisphenols, particularly bisphenols A and F, are widely used in rubber, epoxy 
resins, lubricants, and various synthetic products as essential components or byproducts 
(Sinkkonen et al.,  2003 ). Significant le vels of brominated bisphenols  such as 
tetrachlorobisphenol  can be found in the ash produced during aluminium production 
(Stachel et al.,  2003 ). The average concentration of bisphenol A (BPA) acros s 13 states 
was measured at 0.5 μg/ L, while in 21 e uropean coun tries, it was recorded as 0.016 μg/ L. 
In the United States, only two streams exhibited BPA concentrations exceeding 1μg/ L, 
with a median concentration of 0.14 μg/ L observed in numerous streams.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  
Acute toxicity of p henol and phenolic compounds  
 Phenol and its derivatives are primarily classified based on their hazardous 
properties. According  to Boyd et al. (2001) , the toxicity of phenolic compounds increases 
with the sub stitution of chlorine atoms in p henol. Phenol toxicity is primarily attributed to 
the production of organic and free radical species and the hydrophobic nature of phenolic 
compounds. The hydrophobicity of phenolic compounds is influenced by two key 
parameters: Pow (the octanol -water partition coefficient of undissociated acids) and pKa 
(the compound dissociation constant).  
 Reactivity, which indicates the strength of toxicity, is associated with the ease of 
electron migration within the benzene ring when exposed to oxidase enzymes like 
peroxidase. Increased hydrophobicity, as indicated by higher log P and lower pKa va lues, 
enhances the toxicity of p henol by promoting solubility,  membrane penetration, and 
interaction with cellular structures. The position of the substituent atom in the chemical 
structure and the interaction of substituents affecting the condensation of aromatic rings 
1143                         Heavy Metals in Sediments of the Mangrove Ecosystem in Ras Mohammed Protectorate, Red Sea  
 
 also influence toxicity. Substitution at the or tho position is generally less hazardous 
compared to the meta position. Additionally, the presence of a hydroxyl group in the ring 
makes p henol more susceptible to oxidizing agents and enables various chemical 
reactions, including etherification, esterific ation, oxidation, and substitution 
(Michałowicz & Duda, 2007 ). 
 Hydrogen atoms in the phenol ring and hydroxyl group can be replaced or 
removed, and t he chemical groups attached to p henol , and their positions on the ring 
determine its stability under envir onmental conditions. Phenol undergoes an active 
transformation in the presence of oxygen, facilitated by oxygenase in cytochrome p450, a 
key component of the electron transport chain. This transformation can lead to the 
formation of potentially harmful com pounds , such as phenoxy radicals and intermediate 
metabolites , viz.  semiquinones and quinone methides, which can bind to DNA or proteins 
within cells, causing damage. Phenol reactivity influences the generation of reactive 
oxygen species, including su peroxides, radicals, and hydrogen peroxide, which promote 
lipid peroxidation in membranes. As a result, membrane permeability decreases, allowing 
penetration into cell organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and 
nucleus, as well as comp onents including  enzymes and nucleic acids ( Barlow et al.,  
2007 ; Michałowicz & Duda, 2007; Basha et al.,  2010 ). 
 Industrial waste contains p henol, and consuming just one gram of p henol can 
harm life ( Mohammadi et al.,  2015 ). Additionally, even at relatively low concentrations 
(around 5µg/ L), phenol ic chemicals in drinking water can impart an unpleasant taste and 
odor. Researchers have detected p henol in industrial waste at concentra tions ranging from 
50 to 10,000 mg/ L (García et al.,  1997; Jusoh et al.,  2008 ). Moreover, due to its higher 
density than water and the formation of hazardous compounds even after dil ution, the 
process of diluting p henol is slow. In contaminated fishi ng areas, the concentration of 
phenol in seawater is typically very low, around 0.13 mg/L. However, in the event of an 
accidental phenol leak into the sea, the phenol content can  increase significantly to 
8.28mg/ 100mL due to its high solubility in water ( Wei et al.,  2016 ). 
 Phenolic compounds encompass bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical plasticizer that 
produces epoxy resin, polyc arbonate polymers, and plastics ( Gorini et al.,  2020; Kim et 
al., 2020 ). BPA is found in water at parts per trillion (ppt) levels and exhibits resistance 
to biodegradation ( Luo et al.,  2014 ). Younis et al.,  2023  1144  
 
Fig. 2. The pathway of phenol degradation  
 At concentrations o f 1 to 2% in an aqueous solution, p henol is considered a safe 
disinfectant suitable for treating non -critical medical devices with minimal risk of 
infection spread. However, exposure to this disinfectant can counteract skin irritation. At 
a concentration o f 5mg/ L, phenol is a hazardous pollutant that can cause long -term cell 
damage ( Mohammadi et al.,  2015 ). The typical toxic limits for both aquatic lif e and 
humans range from 9 to 25 mg/ L (Kulkarni et al.,  2013 ). The presence of antibiotic -
resistant genes i n bacteria due to phenolic waste raises concerns about public health 
(Menz et al.,  2019 ).

  Most phenols are volatile and release offensive odo rs into the water, threatening 
aquatic life. Furthermore, they can  disrupt endocrine systems, impede the ox idative 
phosphorylation response, hinder ATP synthesis, and accumulate in various trophic levels 
within the biological food chain ( Tišler et al.,  1997; Duan et al.,  2017; Kong et al.,  
2019 ). 
 Phenol exposure can occur through various pathways, such as work place 
exposure, environmental contact, contaminated food or beverages, and phenol -containing 
products ( ATSDR, 2008 ). The International Agency for Research on Cance r (IARC) 
classified phenols as G roup 3, indicating that there is inadequate information to de termine 
their carcinogenicity in humans or animals. Similarly, the Environmental Protection 
Agenc y (EPA) categorized phenols as G roup D due to insufficient data on their 
carcinogenic potential. B efore widespread distribution, p henol undergoes absorption, 
distribution, and excretion processes in humans, crossing various barriers and membranes 
through diverse transport mechanisms.  
 Factors like molecular weight/shape, charge, lipid solubility, membrane 
composition, and membrane thickness influence the transp ort of toxicants throughout the 
body . Once extensively circulated, p henol can penetrate the placenta, cross the blood -
brain barrier, and even enter human breast milk ( Barlow  et al.,  2007 ). According to 
Michalowicz and Duda (2007) , phenol accumulates primar ily in the muscles, liver, 
brain, and kidneys. It can either be eliminated or undergo conjugation during the 
detoxification process within two days (Barlow et al.,  2007; Basha et al., 2010) . Due to 
its presence in both gaseous and particulate forms in the atmosphere, as well as dire ct 
skin contact and ingestion, p henol is readily absorbed through inhalation. Phenol 
exposure has various adverse effects on living organisms. The biological response to a 
chemical, cell, or tissue dose is referred to as a biolog ical effect. The significance of these 
biological effects and their relationship to further negative health consequences is not 
fully understood. Adverse effects, on the other hand, result in modifications to 
morphology, physiology, growth, development, or  lifespan, impairing the body's ability 
to withstand additional stress or increasing its susceptibility to other toxic substances 
(Barlow et al.,  2007 ). 
 Even in diluted solutions (1 -2%), short -term dermal contact with p henol can cause 
skin irritation ( Basha et al., 2010 ), while prolonged contact can lead to severe skin 
damage ( HPA, 2007 ). Phenol reacts with collagen and keratin -containing amino acids in 
the epidermis, causing coagulation and damage to the skin. Its acidic and irritating 
properties can resu lt in burns upon acute skin exposure. Skin exposure is often associated 
with occupational exposure, particularly among workers handling phenolic compounds in 
chemical factories or agricultural settings, who face the highest risk of phenol absorption 
compar ed to workers in other  industries. Skin contact with p henol can also lead to Younis et al.,  2023  1146  
necrosis, a sign of systemic poisoning, temporary central nervous system stimulation and 
depression that can result in coma ( Basha et al.,  2010 ). The impact of human exposure to 
phenols depends on individual tolerance, similar to scenarios involving ingestion, direct 
skin contact, or inhalation exposures. Prolonged exposure can cause skin eruptions, skin 
irritation, and onychronosis. Additionally, catechol, an int ermediate breakdow n product 
of phenol, is a potent toxin ( Basha et al.,  2010 ).   
Approaches for eliminating phenols in industrial w astewater  
 Industrial wastewater can be categorized as industrial runoff, and its 
characteristics vary significantly across different industrie s. Therefore, diverse treatment 
methods are often employed to address industrial wastewater based on its specific 
composition and regulatory requirements for discharge into public sewers ( Molva &  
Polat, 2004; Busca et al.,  2008 ). 
 Proper treatment of agric ultural runoff containing phenols is crucial to prevent 
their release into open water s, as these compounds pose risks to both human health and 
the quality of drinking water and food processing environments. Recognizing the toxicity 
associated with certain phenolic compounds, the Environmental Protection Agency has 
established a water purification standard specifying a phenol threshold of less than 1 part 
per billion (ppb) in surface waters. These regulations require comprehensive and highly 
efficient treatm ent methods to achieve commercial -scale removal of phenols from 
wastewater. This typically involves a combination of biological and physicochemical 
treatment technologies. For instance, the petroleum industry employs chemical oxidation 
or biological treatm ent methods to eliminate organic pollutants from wastewater. Specific 
treatment techniques tailored to those substances may be necessary when phenolic waste 
contains other contaminants. Selecting effective and appropriate treatment methods 
depends on the w astewater's unique properties and cost -effectiveness considerations.  
 Different tec hniques are employed to remove p henol from wastewater, each 
offering specific advantages and disadvantages. Many wastewater treatment plants 
employ a combination of physical , chemical, and biological processes to achieve 
comprehensive treatment. Integrated treatment systems offer advantages , such as 
improved removal efficiency, flexibility in handling varying influent characteristics, and 
the potential for resource recovery. However, combined treatment systems can be 
complex, requiring significant infrastructure, skilled operation and maintenance, and 
increased operational costs.  
 Solvent extraction is the predomi nant method employed to remove p henol from 
wastewater. This tech nique facilitates the purification of wastew ater by selectively 
extracting p henol from it. Subsequently, carbon or biological adsorption techniques are 
utilized to achieve complete phenol removal. Solvent extraction is also known as liquid -1147                         Heavy Metals in Sediments of the Mangrove Ecosystem in Ras Mohammed Protectorate, Red Sea  
 
 liquid extractio n or solvent abstraction. During this process, constituents present in the 
wastewater are selectively recovered by coming into contact with an organic solvent, as 
they exhibit greater solubility in the solvent compared to the wastewater itself. The 
primary  objective of the solvent extraction procedure is to separate organic compounds 
from wastewater  including phenolic compounds ( Molva & Polat, 2004 ). However, one 
of the disadvantages of solvent extraction is the need for significant quantities of solvents 
and ligands.  
 Frequently, adsorption is a remediation technique for treating polluted wastewater 
and contaminated waterways. Traditional fixed -bed adsorption processes require 
additional steps such as desorption, elution, or regeneration to address saturat ion, 
adsorption, or loading. In cases where recovery is challenging or impractical, the 
saturated adsorbent bed is either discarded or disposed of through controlled incineration 
in appropriate furnaces (Saleh et al.,  2019 ). 
 One commonly used method by sc ientists for extracting liquid organic substances 
is the adsorption onto activated carbon. Activated carbon is derived from various 
carbonaceous materials, including wood, pulp -mill char, peat, and lignite, and it has 
proven to be one of the most effective  adsorbents for water remediation to date. The 
superior adsorption capabilities of these materials can be attributed to their exceptionally 
high surface areas, which enhance their efficacy in removing organic contaminants from 
water.  
 The utilization of me mbrane engineering for phenol removal demonstrates both 
efficiency and economic viability. This approach offers a range of advantages, including 
reduced energy usage, a compact footprint, production of high -quality effluent, and 
simplified scaling of membr ane systems. However, it is crucial to address the issue of 
membrane fouling, which can result in particle damage and the presence of colloids in the 
feed streams ( Mohammadi et al.,  2015; Laura et al.,  2016 ). 
 Several prominent membrane techniques have bee n employed to extract phenols 
from effl uent. These techniques include removal through extractive membrane 
bioreactors and porous fiber membranes, removal of phenol using photocatalytic 
membrane reactors, and removal of phenol through reverse osmosis and na nofiltration.  
 The utiliza tion of extractive membrane b ioreactors (EMBRs) employing an 
aqueous -aqueous extractive membrane cycle, along with biodegradation, demonstrates 
significant pote ntial for efficiently removing p henol from wastewater. In a study 
cond ucted by Loh et al.  (2016) , composite hollow fiber membranes with different 
degrees of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) intrusion were created by depositing a PDMS 
layer onto a polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fiber substrate. The researchers investigated Younis et al.,  2023  1148  
phenol rem oval from wastewater using hollow fib er membranes impregnated with 
trioctylphos phine oxide. Immobilization of p henol within the hollow fib er membrane was 
achieved, leading to its effective removal. This system offers advantages such as 
portability and a daptability, making it readily applicable in environmental engineering 
(Praveen et al., 2013 ). 
 Photocatalytic membrane r eactors represent a hybrid approach where the 
membrane separator acts as a physical barrier for the photocatalyst and functions as a 
functional barrier for the molecules to be degraded. After degradation, the photocatalyst 
particulates need to be separated and removed from the treated water ( Mohammadi et 
al., 2015 ). 
 Nanofiltration is a commonly employed technique for extracting organic 
compounds, inorganic salts, colo r, and hardness from aqueous solutions ( Mohammadi et 
al., 2015 ). Conversely, reverse osmosis is a membrane -based demineralization technique 
primarily used to separate dissolved solids, such as ions, from aqueous solutions. 
Nanofiltration can be used as a pre -treatment step before reverse osmosis to reduce the 
pressure associated with organic materials. However, these systems can be complex, 
requiring significant infrastructure, skilled operation and maintenance, and increased  
operational costs.  
 The concept of sustainable biomaterials explores the intricate relationship 
between renewable natural resources and biomaterials, offering promising opportunities 
for advancing innovative sustainable development approaches in the near  future. There is 
a noticeable emphasis on developing and producing materials derived from renewable 
resources, gradually replacing traditional materials. In the modern era, we find ourselves 
at a critical juncture where achieving sustainable energy is of utmost importance, a goal 
that can only be accomplished through advancements in green technologies. The 
utilization of biomaterials has experienced a steady rise in recent years, surpassing the 
use of conventional materials, indicating a progressive shift towards sustainable practices.  
Algae -based phenol r emoval  
Algal -mediated degradation of p henol  
 The a dvancement in the breakdown of p henol by algae has enabled the isolation, 
culture adaptation, and enrichment of algal strains that can exclusively thrive o n phenols 
as their carbon and energy source ( Klekner & Kosaric, 1992 ). Although p henol 
possesses antibacterial properties, certain phenol -resistant microalgae, as shown in Fig . 2, 
have the capability to degrade p henol.  
 Phenol and its derivatives inhibit t he growth of many green microalgae, requiring 
significant energy for their breakdown. Even at low co ncentrations, as low as 0.05%, 1149                         Heavy Metals in Sediments of the Mangrove Ecosystem in Ras Mohammed Protectorate, Red Sea  
 
 phenol can be detrimental to microalgae, as highlighted by Kahru et al.,  (2002) . 
Microalgal bioremediation, through photosynt hesis and pollutant breakdown, can 
simultaneously sequester carbon dioxide.  
 Despite the fact  that mixotrophic microalgae can mineralize phenolic compounds, 
phototrophic and heterotrophic microalgae are susceptible to phenolic derivatives 
(Tikoo et al.,  1997). Semple and Cain (1996)  reported  that e ukaryotic microalgae 
demonstrate the ability to degr ade aromatic molecules such as p henol. Strains like 
Scenedesmus and Chlorella are frequently employed to biodegradate phenolic chemicals 
(Lutzu et al.,  2015; Chen g et al.,  2016 ). Various phenolic compounds, including 4 -
nitrophenol, 4 -chlorophenol, 2,4 -dinitrophenol, bisphenol ( Klekner & Kosaric, 1992; 
Hirooka et al.,  2003; Tsuji et al., 2003; Lima et al.,  2004) , 2,4-dimethylphenol ( Klekner 
and Kosaric, 1992; Pinto et al., 2002 ), pentachlorophenol ( Tikoo et al.,  1997 ), and 
nonylphenol ( Gao et al., 2011)  can be effectively biodegraded by these strains. Initially 
identifying phenol -degrading strains in cultures includes Spirulina maxima, Scenedesmus 
obliquus, and Chlo rella sp. (Klekner & Kosaric, 1992 ). Additionally, it was discovered 
that Ochromonasdanica  can grow hetero trophically in the presence of p henol, utilizing p -
cresol as its sole carbon substrate ( Semple & Cain, 1996 ) (Table 2).  
 In Chlamydomonas  cells, pheno l biodegradation occurs only when algae require 
carbon stores to maintain homeostasis, as indicated by Nazos et al. (2020) . The adaptable 
bioenergetic apparatus of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  regulates its metabolism to achieve 
a balance between phenol biode gradation and growth ( Nazos et al., 2020) . This 
mechanistic understanding opens avenues for using freshwater and marine microalgae in 
phenol biodegradation. Consequently, microalgae are considered effective agents for 
removing hydrophobic organic contamina nts. 
 Two distinct categories exist for the biodegradation pathway of phenolic 
compounds. The first category is metabolic degradation, where these compounds serve as 
carbon sources for algae or act as donors or acceptors of electrons. The second category 
is co-metabolism, where additional organic substrates support biomass formation and 
serve as electron donors for non -growth purposes ( Xiong et al., 2021 ). Adding more 
phenol to enhance the process can accelerate the biodegradation of p -cresol through co -
metabolism (Xiao et al.,  2019 ) (Table 2 ). In this respect,  Hena et al.  (2021) suggest ed 
that biodegradation relies on various enzymatic processes within the cellular metabolism 
of algae.  
 Desmodesmus sp. eliminates bisphenol A from the culture medium throug h 
oxidative hydroxylation, glycosylation, and oxidation processes. Transcriptome analysis 
of the biodegradation process revealed significant upregulation of oxidoreductase and Younis et al.,  2023  1150  
glycosyltransferase coding genes involved in the oxidative degradation of bisphe nol A in 
microalgae. This promotes adding glycosyl groups for detoxification ( Wang et al., 2017 ). 
 Algae utilize a variety of enzymes  including those from the Phase I and Phase II 
enzyme families  to metabolize harmful chemicals ( Xiao et al., 2019 ). Cytoc hrome P450 
enzymes, such as monooxygenase, dioxygenase, hydroxylase, carboxylase, and 
decarboxylase  are involved in the initial phase. These enzymes employ oxidation, 
reduction, or hydrolysis to convert hydrophobic contaminants into more hydrophilic 
subst ances ( Leng et al., 2020 ). The second phase involves enzymes such as superoxide 
dismutase, catalase, glutathione S transferase, malate/pyruvate dehydrogenase, 
mono(di)oxygenase, pyrophosphatase, and hydrolase, among others. These enzymes 
contribute to the breakdown of organic substances that induce stress in algae cells and aid 
in cell defence. However, the specific roles of these enzymes may slightly vary among 
different algal species ( Sutherland & Ralph, 2019 ).

Photolysis  
 Both direct photolysis and indirect photodegradation, facilitated by the ac tive 
components of algae under light, are involved in the degradation of phenolic pollutants 
(Xiong et al., 2021 ). In natural environments, photodegradation primarily drives the 
transformation of surface -bound phenolic compounds ( Wei et al., 2021 ). Numerou s 
phenolic compounds can undergo direct breakdown and elimination via light exposure, 
even in the absence of algae. Direct photolysis has also been observed as the me chanism 
for the elimination of bisphenol A ( Guo et al., 2017 ), triclosan ( Bai & Acharya, 2 019), 
and phenol ( Nur et al., 2021 ) in various algal wastewater treatment systems.  
 Algae act as efficient photosensitizers, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
in response to radiation during the process of indirect photodegradation. This enables 
algae systems to enhance the removal of specific phenols through indirect 
photodegradation ( Mullineaux et al., 2018 ). The type of oxidant involved, such as 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), singlet oxygen (O 2), superoxide (O2-), and hydroxyl radicals 
(⋅OH), among ot hers influences the process of indirect photodegradation ( Wei et al.,  
2021). Younis et al.,  2023  1152  
 However, certain phenols exhibit resistance to degradation, and light -induced 
algal active compounds are unable to completely eliminate these chemicals ( Yang et al., 
2021 ). 
 In addition to the mentioned mechanisms, other processes that may reduce 
phenolic compounds include hydrolysis, evaporation, precipitation, adsorption onto 
glassware, and aqueous substrate conversion ( Yang et al., 2021 ). Nonetheless, these 
mechanisms are oft en not the primary focus of most research, as they only play a minor 
role in the degradation of contaminants.  
Factors influencing algal phenol d egradation  
 The degradation profile of microorganisms is influenced by various elements that 
must be understood to comp rehend the biodegradability of p henol. Selecting appropriate 
physiological conditions poses a significant challenge, as conventional experimental 
designs require numerous runs to achieve reliable results. Several variables affect phenol 
decompositio n, including temperature, oxygen availability, phenol concentration, initial 
algal density, light intensity, and alternative carbon sources (Nazos et al., 2016 ; 
Priyadharshini & Bakthavatsalam, 2016 ). For microalgal cells to degrade phe nols, 
they require a different carbon source and sufficient light.  
 Furthermore, the addition of diverse organic carbon sources mitigates the toxicity 
of phenolic chemicals and promotes algal growth (Megharaj et al., 1992; Kong et al., 
2019) . Alternative c arbon sources also alleviate the stress response induced by phenol 
toxicity. Phenol acts as the sole carbon source in the medium, leading to the generation of 
carbon reserves for cellular homeostasis and structure. Chlamydomonas  cells exhibit 
higher phenol  uptake within the first 48 hours of incubation when acetic acid is absent 
(Nazos et al., 2020) . Anabena variabilis  and Chlorella fusca  var. vacuolata  microalgae 
strains can degrade phenolic compounds even in the absence of organic carbon sources 
(Hirooka et al., 2003 ). 
 The presence of exogenous glucose has been shown to enhance halophenol 
breakdown. However, Lika and Papadakis (2009)  found that glucose inhibits phenol  
degradation by competing with p henol for oxygen, resulting in slower phenol 
degradation.  The availability of alternative carbon sources that promote microalgal 
growth may limit biodegradation since substrates require sufficient oxygen for 
metabolism.  
 When marit ime microalgae are cultivated, p henol induces the expression of genes 
associated w ith reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and a decrease in chlorophyll 
content ( Hirooka et al., 2003 ). The biodegradability of Scenedesmusobliquus  for various 
monosubstituted phenol forms is influenced by the types of phenolic compounds 1153                         Heavy Metals in Sediments of the Mangrove Ecosystem in Ras Mohammed Protectorate, Red Sea  
 
 investigated an d the culture conditions employed (Papazi & Kotzabasis, 2007) . Cultures 
grown in phenol -free tris -acetate -phosphate (TAP) medium exhibit less acetic acid -
induced microalgal development.  
 Higher phenol concentrations induce more biodegradation in Chlamydomo nas 
reinhardtii under stress con ditions. Conversely, decreased p henol and monosubstituted 
methylphenol content and the removal of other carbon sources from the culture media 
enhance biodegradability ( Nazos et al., 2016 ). Increased nonylphenol concentration  in 
Cyclotella caspia  reduces chlorophyll content and cell proliferation rate ( Liu et al., 
2013 ). While low concentrations of p henol are not toxic to microalgae and can serve as a 
potential carbon source, high phenol concentrations inhibit algal growth by damaging 
photosynthetic pigments and membrane -bound organelles by producing phenol -induced 
phenoxy radicals ( Cho et al., 2016 ). 
 
Fig. 3. Phenol degradation mechanism utilizing algae  
 Light is another crucial factor in the phenol degradation process of mic roalgae. 
High light intensities slow down phenolic compound breakdown as they exacerbate the 
toxicity of light -enhanced autoxidation ( Nakai et al., 2001 ). Phenol degradation occurs 
only in the absence of light, not under photoautotrophic and photoheterotro phic 
conditions, as observed in Synechococcus  PCC 7002 by Wurster et al. (2003) . Likewise, 
Scenedesmus  sp. performs better under heterotrophic conditions compared to mixotrophic 
Younis et al.,  2023  1154  
conditions, possibly due to reduced light penetration in the latter, emphasizin g the critical 
role of light in phenol degradation ( Di Caprio et al., 2018 ). 
 Temperature is also a significant parameter affecting phenol biodegradation by 
microorganisms. Lower temperatures (e.g., 10°C) hinder the removal process by 
Isochrysis galbana du e to enzyme inhibition, which retards growth and metabolism ( Li et 
al., 2019 ). Higher temperatures enhance the activity of photosynthesis -related enzymes 
and key processes like carbon dioxide diffusion ( Raven et al., 1988 ). Elevated 
temperatures accelerate  cellular metabolism, promoting microalgal growth. However, 
exceeding the optimum temperature leads to irreversible physiological reactions in cells, 
negatively impacting algae growth and photosynthetic rates.  
Other mechanisms of phenolic pollutant r emoval  
 Algae employ a range of mechanisms to remove detrimental phenolic pollutants 
and ensure their survival after exposure. These mechanisms encompass hydrolysis, 
photodegradation, adsorption, accumulation, and biodegradation. Table (2) provides a 
comprehensi ve overview of the laboratory experiment procedures involving algae for 
phenolic contaminant removal.  
 
Adsorption  
 Adsorption is a passive method for removing pollutants by binding them to solid 
materials ( Bilal et al.,  2018 ). Various adsorbents  includin g activated carbon and 
nanomaterials  have effectively removed phenolic pollutants (Fu et al.,  2019; 
Kartikadevi et al.,  2021; Alminderej et al.,  2022) . The microalgae cell wall, composed 
of polymer components such as protein and cellulose, contains functi onal groups, which 
include carboxylate, amine, imidazole, phosphate, sulfhydryl, sulfate, and hydroxyl 
groups, that actively participate in biosorption (Redha, 2020) (Fig. 4).  
 1155                         Heavy Metals in Sediments of the Mangrove Ecosystem in Ras Mohammed Protectorate, Red Sea  
 
  
Fig. 4. Functional groups involved in phenol adsorption on algal cell wall s urfaces  
 In comparison to the cultivation of fresh algae over a long period, dried algae 
powder and fresh seaweed obtained from algae -based wastewater treatment plants or 
residual algal biomass after oil extraction can be directly employed as adsorption 
materials, saving time and resources (Abbas et al., 2019) . 
 Certain algae efficiently remove specific phenolic compounds through adsorption 
(Fig. 5). For instance , Ulva lactuca , when dr ied and processed into 0.5 to 1 mm 
fragme nts, can eliminate 90.125% of 1 mg/ L phenol in simulated wastewater (Abbas et 
al., 2019) . Additionally, Zheng et al. , (2017)  reported that Chlorella -derived biochar has 
a potential adsorption capacity for p -nitrophenol that is 140% higher than that of 
activated carbon. Thus,  adsorption ma y not be the primary mechanism for phenol 
removal in some studies, it can still serve as an initial stage for bioaccumulation, 
biodegradation, and other processes ( Bilal et al.,  2018 ). 
Fig. 5. Adsorption mechanisms for phenol removal using algae: A schema tic diagram  
Younis et al.,  2023  1156  
Bioaccumulation  
 Bioaccumulation, or uptake, refers to the process in which certain contaminants 
permeate the algal cell membrane and become absorbed within the cell ( Xiong et al.,  
2021; Elkady & Younis, 2023 ). 
 Dichloromethane: methanol (1:2,  v/v) extraction combined with ultrasonic 
treatment is the most commonly used method for extracting phenolic substances from 
microalgae. Some studies utilize radioactive substance labels to directly measure the 
bioaccumulation of substances ( Ding et al.,  2018; Lv et al., 2019 ). 
 Algae -mediated absorption has proven to be one of the most effective methods for 
removing hydrophobic substances ( Bai & Acharya, 2016 ). For instnace , Desmodesmus 
subspicatus , a green alga l, was found to accumulate nearly 23% of rad iolabeled 17α -
ethinyl estradiol within 24 hours ( Maes  et al.,  2014 ). Bioaccumulation often exhibits a 
two-stage release pattern: the first stage involves rapid elimination, while the second 
stage is characterized by slower removal. After exposure to triclo san, Cymbella  sp. 
showed intracellu lar triclosan levels of 24.37 mg/ gDW at 24 hours and 4.02 mg/ gDW at 
144 hours ( Ding et al., 2018 ). 
 Furthermore, the gradual decrease in intracellular phenolics may be attributed to 
the release of microalgae cells into th e culture media or the biotransformation occurring 
within the cells ( Ding et al.,  2018 ). Suppose hazardous and harmful molecules 
accumulated in algal cells are not promptly converted into low -toxic and innocuous 
compounds. In that case, they can continue a ccumulating, propagating through the food 
chain, and ultimately enriching the human body.  
Integration of algal biomass production for effective treatment of phenolic 
compound -containing w astewater  
 Nutrient -rich wastewater holds significant potential for utilization as an abundant 
and easily accessible resource for the cultivation of microalgae (Williams et al.,  2010) . 
Microalgae,  a diverse group of photosynthetic microorganisms , offer valuable prospects 
to produce various commodities , including food, fee d, biofertilizers, biofuels, 
biopolymers, and other high -value goods (Williams et al.,  2010; Stiles et al., 2018) . 
 It is important to acknowledge that although concerns regarding human 
consumption exist, microalgae cultivated on wastewater have shown prom ise in 
applications such as animal feed/nutrition, biofuel production, and biofertilizer 
development (Olguín, 2012; Acién Fernández et al.,  2018) . Microalgae, as microscopic 
photosynthetic organisms, belong to the diverse group of algae.  1157                         Heavy Metals in Sediments of the Mangrove Ecosystem in Ras Mohammed Protectorate, Red Sea  
 
  Microorganisms po ssess the capability to assimilate carbon dioxide (CO2) and 
essential nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus . These microorganisms are well 
known for their involvement in bioremediation processes.  
 The wide range of habitats and the broad toleranc e of microorganisms contribute 
to their effectiveness in treating wastewater from various sources.  Environmental 
conditions, specifically nutrient levels , have been extensively documented in previous 
studies (Williams et al.,  2010; El -Sheekh & Abomohra, 2 021). 
 To achieve effective phenolic compound removal while maximizing algal 
biomass production, several factors should be considered. Nutrient management plays a 
crucial role in algal cultivation, as it affects both biomass growth and phenolic compound 
uptake. Balancing the nutrient supply, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, is essential 
to prevent excessive algal growth and to promote the synthesis of high -value biomass 
products. Optimizing light exposure through photobioreactors or open ponds is neces sary 
to enhance algal photosynthesis and biomass productivity.  
 Extensive research has been dedicated to investigating the production of 
microalgae using wastewater as a growth medium. As previously mentioned, this 
approach has demonstrated high efficacy i n pollutant removal from diverse wastewater 
sources, including residential and industrial sources  (Williams et al.,  2010; El -Sheekh  et 
al., 2020; El -Sheekh et al.,  2022).  Microalgae cultivation has been successfully carried 
out using different stages of r esidential wastewater treatment, including raw sewage, 
settled sewage, anaerobically digested wastewater, and centrate obtained from digestate 
dewatering (El-Sheekh et al.,  2022) . Moreover, microalgae growth has been achieved 
utilizing agro -industrial wast ewater from various origins, such as tanneries (Sekaran et 
al., 2013) , digestate derived from agro -industrial waste (Zuliani et al.,  2016) ,piggery 
effluent (Raeisossadati et al.,  2019) , and anaerobically digested abattoir effluent 
(Vadiveloo et al.,  2020) . 
 Algal biomass exhibits inherent capabilities for phenolic compound removal from 
wastewater. The mechanisms involved include physical adsorption, biodegradation, and 
enzymatic transformations. Algal cells possess surface binding sites that can adsorb 
phen olic compounds, effectively removing them from the water phase. Furthermore, algal 
enzymes, such as peroxidases and laccases, participate in the degradation of phenolic 
compounds, converting them into less toxic byproducts. Understanding these removal 
mech anisms is crucial for optimizing the integration process.  
 To further enhance phenolic compound removal efficiency, integrating algal 
biomass production with other wastewater treatment processes can be advantageous. For 
instance, combining algal cultivatio n with adsorption techniques using activated carbon Younis et al.,  2023  1158  
or other adsorbents can provide complementary removal mechanisms. Additionally, 
advanced oxidation processes, such as ozonation or photocatalysis, can be integrated to 
enhance the degradation of recalcitr ant phenolic compounds. These synergistic 
approaches capitalize on the strengths of different treatment technologies, resulting in 
more comprehensive and efficient wastewater treatment.  
 Despite the potential benefits of integrating algal biomass productio n with 
phenolic compound removal, several challenges need to be addressed. These include the 
selection of suitable algal strains with high phenolic compound tolerance and uptake 
capacities, optimization of cultivation conditions for simultaneous biomass pr oduction 
and removal efficiency, and economic feasibility at a larger scale. Furthermore, the fate 
of accumulated phenolic compounds within the algal biomass, such as their potential 
release during biomass harvesting or downstream processing, requires care ful 
consideration.  
      CONCLUSION  
 
 The elimination of phenolic compounds is essential for environmental protection. 
Biological treatment is the most effective and environmentally sustainable approach 
among the available methods. This treatment has gained incr easing interest in the field of 
pollution control. Algae play a crucial role in natural ecosystems, contributing to the 
biodegradation of phenol. Their ability to thrive in harsh environments provides 
advantages for efficient and rapid removal of phenolic  contaminants.  
 Algae have the potential to eliminate hazardous phenolic compounds present in 
wastewater effectively. Algae -based technology offers a sustainable, environmentally 
conscious, cost -effective alternative to conventional wastewater treatment te chniques. 
Recent research efforts have primarily focused on optimizing the degradation process by 
investigating the effects of various factors on algae performance under controlled 
experimental conditions. However, there are significant research gaps regar ding the 
bioremediation of real wastewater by algae, the determination of toxicity of degradation 
products, and the modification of chassis through synthetic biology strategies. Therefore, 
further relevant research is needed to address these gaps and advan ce the field.
