Abstract: The low power generation e ciency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is always a barrier to
further development. An attempt to enhance the start-up and electricity generation of MFCs was
investigated by adding di erent doses of zero-valent iron into anaerobic anode chambers in this
study. The results showed that the voltage (289.6 mV) of A2 with 0.5 g of zero-valent iron added was
higher than the reference reactor (197.1 mV) without dosing zero-valent iron (A4). The maximum
power density of 27.3 mW /m2was obtained in A2. CV analysis demonstrated that A2 possessed
a higher oxidation‚Äìreduction potential, hence showing a stronger oxidizing property. Meanwhile,
electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS) also manifested that values of RCT of carbon felts with
zero-valent iron supplemented (0.01‚Äì0.03 W) were generally lower. What is more, SEM images further
proved and illustrated that A2 had compact and dense meshes with a hierarchical structure rather
than a relatively looser bioÔ¨Ålm in the other reactors. High-throughput sequencing analysis also
indicated that zero-valent iron increased the abundance of some functional microbial communities,
such as Acinetobacter, Ignavibacteriales, Shewanella , etc.

1. Introduction
Energy crisis and environmental contamination have been pushing researchers to search for new
kinds of sustainable, renewable, and clean energy [ 1]. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a green bioenergy
technology, which are considered as a newly bioelectrochemical device that can convert available
organic matters into electricity by exoelectrogenic bacteria attached on the anode [ 2,3]. Therefore,
MFCs o er a new opportunity for simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation [ 4]. At
present, many e orts have been made to improve the performance of MFCs [ 5‚Äì7] and many works have
focused on the microbial community composition of the anode bioÔ¨Ålm [ 8]. However, little attention
has been devoted to the e ect of metal elements on the bioÔ¨Ålm during start-up in MFCs.
In recent years, many metals and their oxides were used to modify the cathode or anode of MFCs
in an attempt to improve the ability to transfer electrons in reactors. In MFCs, the pass-way of the
anode‚Äôs extracellular electrons transfer can be divided into direct electron transfer and indirect electron
transfer [ 9‚Äì11]. The former is transferred by the microbial extracellular cytochrome or ‚Äúnanowires‚Äù

while a soluble redox mediator is needed in the latter. Furthermore, transfer mediators can be added
exogenously or endogenously [ 12,13], and microbes use their own redox secretion or extraneous
substances to facilitate electron transfer extracellularly, and then to the electrode surface [ 14,15]. The
addition of metal elements can not only improve electrical performance directly but also play an
important role in the culture of exoelectrogenic bacteria.
Studies show that the electrical performance of MFCs depends largely on the number of
exoelectrogenic bacteria enriched on the anaerobic bioÔ¨Ålm, most of which belong to iron-reducing
bacteria (IRB). Moreover, a further study found that adding Fe (III) oxide to MFCs could enrich
exoelectrogenic bacteria and also enhance the electrical performance of reactors. For example, Zhang
et al. [ 16] pointed out that the addition of Fe (OH) 3enhanced both anaerobic digestion and anodic
oxidation, resulting in an e ective mineralization of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which was beneÔ¨Åcial for
improving anodic oxidation and enhancing microorganisms‚Äô growth. Also, Wu et al. [ 17] demonstrated
that Fe (III) supplemented into MFCs resulted in increased electricity generation by Shewanella
oneidensis MR-1.
Zero-valent iron, the most basic form of iron, has seldom been used directly in the research of
MFCs and it is in a doped or oxidized state. However, zero-valent iron, ferrous, or ferric iron is
inextricably linked by accepting and losing electrons in redox reactions. It was assumed that zero-valent
iron was likely to enhance the conversion of propionate to acetate because it could serve as an electron
donor in microbial metabolism [ 18] and promote the activities of key enzymes in the acetogenesis
process [ 19,20]. Interestingly, it is generally believed that acetic acid [ 21] could act as an appropriate
substrate for exoelectrogenic bacteria, thus the power generation of MFCs is greatly improved.
However, the mechanism of zero-valent iron obtained in MFCs during start-up has been rarely
reported. To gain insight into understanding the e ects of zero-valent iron on MFC, the electron
transfer property, anode bioÔ¨Ålm formation, and biological community were investigated and analyzed
in MFCs with di erent amounts of zero-valent iron addition in this study.

Œ¶12 cm), separated by a proton exchange memb rane (PEM) (Nafion 117,  Dupond, Hayward, CA, 
USA), whose inner diameter was 2 cm. Each chamber has a carbon felt electrode (5 cm √ó 6 cm √ó 0.2 cm, US Morgan). The electrode space is 15 cm and connected with an external resistance of 1000 Œ© as

2.2. Experimental Methods
Experiments were conducted in batch mode with four parallel two-chamber MFCs containing four
dierent concentrations of zero-valent iron: 0.1 g of zero-valent iron added (A1), 0.5 g of zero-valent
iron added (A2), 1 g of zero-valent iron added (A3), and no zero-valent iron added (A4).
The two chambers, both Ô¨Ålled with electrode medium (pH 7.0), contained: (NH 4)2SO4(0.56 g /L),
KCl (0.13 g /L), NaH 2PO4(4.22 g /L), Na 2HPO 4(2.75 g /L), MgSO 47H2O (0.2 g /L), and 1 mL /L of trace
elements solution, containing: H 3BO 3(2 mg /L), FeCl 24H2O (2 mg /L), EDTA (2 mg /L), ZnCl 24H2O
(0.4 mg /L), MnCl 24H2O (0.8 mg /L), CuCl 22H2O (0.2 mg /L), (NH4) 6MO 74H2O (1.1 mg /L), and
NiCl 26H2O (1mg /L). Sodium acetate was controlled at COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) of 800 mg /L
in the anodic solution.
The sludge was obtained from the sedimentation tank of a municipal sewage plant in Nanjing
(China). After removing large debris, the volatile suspended sludge (VSS) was 4.4 g /L and total
suspended sludge (TSS) was 8.0 g /L.
The anaerobic digester sludge was inoculated in the anode compartment (15%, v/v) as the biological
catalyst, whereas the cathode compartment was continuously aerated with air.
2.3. Electrochemical Analysis
The voltage was measured by a voltmeter, and polarization curves for the MFCs were generated
by changing the external resistance in the range 10‚Äì10,000 W. Power density was calculated using the
formula, p=UI/A, where U denotes the voltage between the anode and cathode, I denotes the current
calculated from Ohm‚Äôs law, and A denotes the area of the anode carbon felt.
Cyclic voltammetric characterization of the oxide electrode was performed in the potential range
of 0.7 to 0.7 V with respect to the calomel electrode (NCE), and Pt wire was used as the counter
electrode in the phosphate bu er. The impedance spectra of the anode Ô¨Ålm were recorded in the
frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz with the alternating current (AC) amplitude of 10 mV , and
the data collected were analyzed by using Zsimpwin software [22].
2.4. Chemical Analysis
TSS, VSS, and COD were conducted in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater [ 23]. The morphology of the four anodes was subjected to scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) by cutting o 0.5 cm 0.5 cm 0.2 cm pieces.
2.5. High-Throughput Sequencing (Miseq)
High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (Miseq, Illu-mina) was conducted for further
analysis of the key four sludge samples. The sequencing and data analysis were performed by the
Zhongyijinda Analytical & Testing Co., Ltd (Jiangsu; China). The heatmaps and cluster analyses were
obtained using the R programming language (R-3.1.0).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. E ect of Zero-Valent Iron on Voltage of MFCs during Start-Up
The voltage output of four groups increased slowly at Ô¨Årst and Ô¨Ånally became stable in MFCs
supplemented with di erent concentrations of zero-valent iron, as shown in Figure 2. The voltage
of A2 was the highest, which could reach up to 289.6 mV , and the voltages of A1 and A3 had no big
dierence, with a maximum of 215.3 and 204.3 mV , respectively. Surprisingly, the voltage of A4 could
only reach the peak of 197.1 mV . In addition, it can be found that A2 took 400 h to reach the voltage
platform while A1 took 420 h and A3 and A4 still had a rising tendency after 500 h, suggesting that
the addition of zero-valent iron accelerated the start-up of the reactors. Zero-valent iron substantiallyInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 806 4 of 15

and the highest voltage was observed with the appropriate concentration range.

3.2. Effect of Zero-Valent Iron on Po wer Density of MFCs during Start-Up 
Figure 3 illustrates the power density of the MFC with a varying zero-valent iron concentration. 
MFCs supplemented with zero-valent iron during start-up showed higher power densities than that 
obtained in the control without zero-valent iron. The maximum power density of 27.3 mW/m2 in the 
presence of 0.5 g of zero-valent iron  was obtained, compared to 8.5 mW/m2 without zero-valent iron. 
Meanwhile, A1 delivered a maximum power density of 20.8 mW/m2 and A3 reached the peak of 10.0 
mW/m2. Furthermore, the power density was decreased when the zero-valent iron concentration 
further reached 1.0 g. An increase in the power de nsity occurred at first and then decreased as the 
current density increased because of the polarization of internal resistance. The results showed good consistency with the observed voltage, indicating  that zero-valent iron could greatly enhance the 
power generation of MFCs at low concentrations; ho wever, the reaction would be inhibited at higher 
concentrations. Jia et al. [24] also verified that the addition of ZVI to the digestion could retard 
excessive acidification by promoting butyric acid conversion and accumulating direct interspecies 
electron transfer simultaneously to enhance the biosensor‚Äôs performance under a moderate amount 
of ZVI. The reason for this phenomenon could be explained as follows. On the one hand, Fe
2+ (Fe0 + 
2H+ = Fe2+ + H 2) would be released when supplemented with a moderate dose, which changes the 
iron‚Äôs strength inordinately and compresses the electric double layer of sludge effectively [25,26]. On 
the other hand, zero-valent iron would decrease reactors‚Äô ORP and reduce the accumulation of 
propionate, which facilitates the conversion of ma cromolecular acids to a smaller molecule [27].

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) enables direct detection of redox signals, senses potential di erences
across the interface, and helps elucidate electrochemical reactions occurring at electrode surfaces [ 28],
so CVs were tested during stable current generation to evaluate the importance of zero-valent iron on
anodic electrochemical behavior. A single peak showing no retracing trend indicated this process was
irreversible, as shown in Figure 4. The rate of ipa /ipc of these two peak currents was unequal to 1,
which also conÔ¨Årmed this judgment. Furthermore, the gap of the peak potential between the anode

No big difference in the irreversible degrees between each reactor supplemented with different 
doses of zero-valent iron was found, but there were  still a couple of weakly defined redox peaks at 
‚àí0.6 (A1) and 0.5 V (A2), and the CVs of the zero-valent iron added exhibited a broader current range, 
suggesting zero-valent iron might produce redox mediators. As we all know, the redox potential can reflect the macroscopic oxidation‚Äìreduction property  of substances in aqueous solution; the higher 
the oxidation‚Äìreduction potential, the stronger th e oxidation ability. In Figure 4, the oxidation‚Äì
reduction potential of A2 was higher than A1, showing that the oxidation ability of A2 was stronger and the solution was oxidizing. In addition, the area s of five closed redox cu rves varied dissimilarly, 
specifically A2 > A1 > A3 > A4 > primary carbon felt . It has been pointed out that the area of CV can 
reflect the amount of electricity exchanged betw een the oxidation and redu ction reactions of an 
electro-active material, which can also demonstrate th e polarization state of the internal electrode as 
well as the utilization of active substance [31,32]. So , it can be inferred that A2 has the most electro-
active substances and its utilization rate of exoelectrogens was relatively higher.

Combined with the analysis above, A2, which had a suitable dose of zero-valent iron added, 
exhibited excellent electrochemical activity. The positive oxidation potential illustrated the reaction was more oxidizing and the metabolism of exoelectrogens on the surface of the electrode was more active. However, the oxidation peak of A3 was suppressed, because the addition of excessive zero valent iron inhibited the partial oxidation of anode microorganisms in the MFC, which probably 
weakened the redox reaction. Therefore, it was poss ible that the overall performance of MFCs could 
be improved by choosing an optimal concentratio n of zero-valent iron in the anode solution.

amount of electricity exchanged between the oxidation and reduction reactions of an electro-active
material, which can also demonstrate the polarization state of the internal electrode as well as the
utilization of active substance [ 31,32]. So, it can be inferred that A2 has the most electro-active
substances and its utilization rate of exoelectrogens was relatively higher.
Combined with the analysis above, A2, which had a suitable dose of zero-valent iron added,
exhibited excellent electrochemical activity. The positive oxidation potential illustrated the reaction was
more oxidizing and the metabolism of exoelectrogens on the surface of the electrode was more active.
However, the oxidation peak of A3 was suppressed, because the addition of excessive zero valent iron
inhibited the partial oxidation of anode microorganisms in the MFC, which probably weakened the
redox reaction. Therefore, it was possible that the overall performance of MFCs could be improved by
choosing an optimal concentration of zero-valent iron in the anode solution.
EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) was used to measure anode properties, such as the
internal resistance and coating layers [ 33]. In MFCs, the performance of the anode is mainly a ected
by electrode reaction kinetics and mass di usion. So, in order to Ô¨Ågure out the e ects of di erent doses
of zero-valent iron on the internal transfer impedance and distribution of electro-active bioÔ¨Ålm, the EIS
of dierent electrodes was tested. As we all know, the charge between the surface of the electrode
and contacted electrolyte solution was the opposite, forming an electric double layer capacitance.
Meanwhile, electron transfer resistance also formed due to asynchronization of the electronic transfer,
and di erences between the electronic conductivity and solution ion conductivity when electrons
were transferred on the interface of electrode /electrolyte. What is more, a di usion layer trend is
formed by solution ions under the e ect of the voltage, and the electrolyte solution itself also has a
certain impedance.
Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 5. It could be seen from the curves that all Ô¨Åve carbon felts
have the shape of a circular arc, representing resistance when electrons transfer inside it, and a straight
line close to 45. According to polarization theory, di usion impedance exhibits a straight line at
low frequency, suggesting that Warburg impedance, which is caused by the di usion of oxygen in
electrolyte solution outside the electrode, is formed and has the characteristic of semi-inÔ¨Ånite di usion.
Th arc diameter is relatively larger in an open circuit because it is related to the exchange current
density of the oxygen reduction reaction [34,35].

the internal resistance and coating layers [33]. In MFCs, the performance of the anode is mainly 
affected by electrode reaction kinetics and mass di ffusion. So, in order to figure out the effects of 
different doses of zero-valent iron on the internal  transfer impedance and distribution of electro-
active biofilm, the EIS of different electrodes wa s tested. As we all know, the charge between the 
surface of the electrode and contacted electrolyte solution was the opposite, forming an electric 
double layer capacitance. Meanwhile, electron  transfer resistance also formed due to 
asynchronization of the electronic transfer, and di fferences between the electronic conductivity and 
solution ion conductivity when electrons were tran sferred on the interface of electrode/electrolyte. 
What is more, a diffusion layer trend is formed by solution ions under the effect of the voltage, and 
the electrolyte solution itself also has a certain impedance. 
Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 5. It could be seen from the curves that  all five carbon felts 
have the shape of a circular arc, representing re sistance when electrons transfer inside it, and a 
straight line close to 45¬∞. According to polarization theory, diffusion impedance exhibits a straight line at low frequency, suggesting that Warburg impedance, which is caused by the diffusion of oxygen in electrolyte solution outside the electrode,  is formed and has the characteristic of semi-
infinite diffusion. Th arc diameter is relatively larger in an open circuit because it is related to the 
exchange current density of the oxygen reduction reaction [34,35].

In this electrochemical system, the arc appearing at high frequency represented R S(ohmic
resistance) since the structure of the working electrode carbon felt was porous. The Ô¨Åtted data
suggested that R Swere close to each other [ 37,38], with an average value of 22.43 2.18Wunder
dierent doses of zero-valent iron. This was because R Smainly depends on the conÔ¨Åguration of the
reactor while the catalytic e ect is not signiÔ¨Åcant. In addition, there were two other processes in the
solution: Charge transfer and mass transfer. R CT(charge transfer internal resistance) is caused by
the energy activation barrier, which needs to be overcome during an electro-chemical reaction, while
mass transfer resistance indicates the e ect of mass di usion on the electrode and it can be deÔ¨Åned as
semi-inÔ¨Ånite di usion by the shape in the study.
RCTin Table 1 showed that the R CTof carbon felts with zero-valent iron supplemented were
generally low while values with no zero-valent iron supplemented were sharply increased. After a
period of domestication, a layer of bioÔ¨Ålm attached, with zero-valent iron forming and then adsorbing
on the electrode surface so that electrons produced by exoelectrogens could be transferred by this
bioÔ¨Ålm, thereby reducing R CT. RCTin A2, which had 0.5 g of zero-valent iron added, had the lowest
value (0.01 W) while A4 (33.84 W) with no zero-valent iron added had the highest (except primary
carbon felt). Combined with SEM above, the bioÔ¨Ålm of A2 was relatively enriched and electro-active
microorganisms continuously adhered to the electrode, which hastened the electron transfer rate of
carbon felts and reduced their resistance. Hence, it was possible to conÔ¨Årm that the high values of
the voltage and power density precisely contributed to the low R CT, which improved the electron
transfer e ciency and enhanced the electrochemical performance. However, W (Warburg impedance)
of A2 was relatively high because the bioÔ¨Ålm enriched in A2 was mature, abundant, and thick.
Correspondingly, there were less electro-active microorganisms in A4, so the resistance was higher
during the mass transfer process and mass di usion was more di cult, which caused the high value
of R CT. In addition, it was found that the second arc of primary carbon felt was biased and it was
not a strictly semi-inÔ¨Ånite di usion, appearing as the shape of an arc because of the lack of bioÔ¨Ålm
enrichment and poor conductive properties.
3.4. SEM Images of the Anode Surface of MFCs
As a corollary, the high performance of electricity generation could contribute to the large number
of enriched bioÔ¨Ålms on the carbon felt surface. In light of this, SEM analysis was conducted to make
morphological observations of carbon felts supplemented with di erent doses of zero-valent iron.
SEM images (Figure 6) recorded at high magniÔ¨Åcation clearly showed compact and dense meshes
with a hierarchical structure, which had 0.5 g of zero-valent iron added (A2). Meanwhile, the bioÔ¨Ålm
of A1 was relatively porous with a looser and irregular structure and A3 or A4 showed a very loose
bioÔ¨Ålm shape, exhibiting a smaller speciÔ¨Åc surface area with no lattice-like structure. Combined with
the voltage and power density discussed above, it could be concluded that carbon felt enriched withInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 806 8 of 15
more bioÔ¨Ålms had a better electric performance. The reason could be illustrated as follows. The
parts where enriched bioÔ¨Ålms had more exoelectrogens and electrochemically active microbes, which
were comprised mainly of cytochromes, served as electron conduits between intracellular catabolic
reactions and extracellular conducive materials (e.g., electrodes) [ 39], and had unique extracellular
electron transport pathways. As we all know, some electroactive microorganisms are recognized as
dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria, which can access iron as an electron acceptor to transfer electrons
during the respiration process [ 40]. As a result, the addition of zero-valent iron to MFC reactors could
culture and catalyze the production of iron-reducing bacteria.

Zero-valent iron in the A1 reactor was the le ast, and the growing environment provided for 
microorganisms was mild and suitable, causing the acclimation of exoelectrogens and an improvement of the power generation. When the conc entration of zero-valent iron was continuously 
increased, i.e., in the A2 reactor, microorganisms seemed to adjust the changes, so on the one hand, the enzyme activity and biological reaction rate were further improved, an d on the other hand, the 
presence of a little amount of oxygen in the anod ic reactor would gradually oxidize zero-valent iron, 
forming iron oxides deposited on the surface of zero -valent iron to avoid direct contact between zero-
valent iron and microorganisms, which reduced the inhibitory effects on the activity of the exoelectrogens. However, organic matter would be constantly consumed by microorganisms as the dose further increased, exposing more zero-valent iron and releasing excessive iron ions, which had 
a toxic effect on exoelectrogens and inhibited thei r activity, consequently showing a rapid reduction 
in voltage. This phenomenon is supported by Antwi et  al. [41], who pointed out that the effect of the 
addition of 0, 1, 4, 10, and 20 g/L ZVI on the microbial community structure was different and the microbial community shift was most pronounced in assays with 10 and 20 g/L ZVI. 
3.5. High-Throughput Sequencing and Microbial Community Analysis 
The DNA was extracted from biofilms sampled from all anodes. According to Table 2, A2 with 
0.5 g of zero-valent iron added ow ned the highest biodiversity (Sha nnon index = 6.49) while A4 with 
no zero-valent iron added owned the lowest biodiver sity (Shannon index = 5.76). So, it was indicated 
that supplementation of zero-valent iron could infl uence the distribution of the microbial community.

Zero-valent iron in the A1 reactor was the least, and the growing environment provided for
microorganisms was mild and suitable, causing the acclimation of exoelectrogens and an improvement
of the power generation. When the concentration of zero-valent iron was continuously increased,
i.e., in the A2 reactor, microorganisms seemed to adjust the changes, so on the one hand, the enzyme
activity and biological reaction rate were further improved, and on the other hand, the presence of
a little amount of oxygen in the anodic reactor would gradually oxidize zero-valent iron, forming
iron oxides deposited on the surface of zero-valent iron to avoid direct contact between zero-valent
iron and microorganisms, which reduced the inhibitory e ects on the activity of the exoelectrogens.
However, organic matter would be constantly consumed by microorganisms as the dose further
increased, exposing more zero-valent iron and releasing excessive iron ions, which had a toxic e ect on
exoelectrogens and inhibited their activity, consequently showing a rapid reduction in voltage. This
phenomenon is supported by Antwi et al. [ 41], who pointed out that the e ect of the addition of 0, 1, 4,
10, and 20 g /L ZVI on the microbial community structure was di erent and the microbial community

At the phylum level, bacterial species in the anode bioÔ¨Ålm were dominated by Proteobacteria ,
Bacteroidetes , and Firmicutes , followed by Actinobacteria ,ChloroÔ¨Çexi ,Planctomycetes ,Acidobacteria , and
others. In the community, the Proteobacteria phylum was the most abundant in all samples and it was
present at higher percentages in both A2 and A3 (56‚Äì64%) than other samples (39‚Äì51%). Well-known
electroactive genera of this phylum (such as Geobacter ,Pseudomonas ,Desulfuromonas , etc.) often play
important roles in bioelectroactive bioÔ¨Ålms [ 42,43]. From Figure 7, the Bacteroidetes phylum was the
second dominant microorganism in MFCs; it was present the most in A1 (30%) and the least in A3 (19%).
The presence of Bacteroidetes was previously reported in fermentative bioelectrochemical bioÔ¨Ålms due
to their ability to biodegrade polymeric proteins and carbohydrates [ 44,45]. The Firmicutes phylum
was often retrieved in bioelectrochemical systems, associated with the electrogenic activity. In this
study, it was found in all samples: 10% for A1 and around 3% for A2, A3, and A4. Additionally, the
presence of Actinobacteria also reÔ¨Çected its assistance in organic degradation since they are known to be
members of versatile hydrocarbon degraders [46].

was in the vicinity of first principal component axis and contributed a lot to the axis, indicating that 
the presence of such a microorganism directly af fected the performance of the entire MFCs. In 
addition, Pelomonas , Arcobacter , and Flavobacterium were also distributed near the main coordinate 
axis and made such contributions to both axes, so their contents had a certain influence on MFCs to some degree. What is more, it was concluded that the gaps of the angle among the three types of microorganisms, Pseudomonas , Flavobacterium , and  Pelomonas , were small, indicating that the three 
had similar properties with a cert ain affinity when under dosages of  the zero-valent iron. Similarly,

Redundancy analysis (RDA) is a classiÔ¨Åcation method based on the development of correspondence
analysis. Combining the corresponding analysis with the multiple regression analysis, each step of the
RDA is calculated with environmental factors, reÔ¨Çecting the relationship between microorganisms
and environmental factors. Similar to the data format of PCA, Ô¨Åve environmental factors, including
voltage, OTUs, Chao, Shannon, and ACE, were selected for RDA analysis of the MFCs system. Arrows
mean di erent environmental factors, and when the angle between environmental factors is less than
90, this indicates there is a positive correlation between the two factors; otherwise, it is negatively
correlated. What is more, the longer the line of the environmental factor, the greater the inÔ¨Çuence of
the impact factor.
In Figure 10, it was found that the angles among the voltage, OTUs, Chao, Shannon, and ACE
index were less than 90, showing a positive correlation between these environmental factors. So,
it means that an increase in the abundance of microorganisms as well as community activity could

In conclusion, the anode of the MFC is an anaerobic reactor essentially. Acinetobacter  was 
reported to constitute, at least in part, the anodic bacteria in MFCs using anaerobic sludge from wastewater treatment plants as inoc ulate [47]. In the research of Embree et al. [48] on a single-cell 
genome and metatranscriptome sequencing of me tabolic interactions of an alkane-degrading 
methanogenic community, he found that unknown members of the orders Ignavibacteriales  became 
more predominant during growth on fatty acids. Th erefore, there is a certain relationship between 
this kind of bacteria and anaerobic fermentation, which may be conducive to methane production. In addition, it was reported that the genus Shewanella  was divided into two subgenera on the basis of 
the phylogenetic structure, growth properties in re lation to pressure, and polyunsaturated fatty acid 
production [49]. Therefore, the addition of zero-v alent iron changed the microbial community in the 
system, and further changed the anaerobic digestion process. This was mainly due to its strong 
reductive property, and zero-valent iron is expected to provide electrons for methanogenesis by producing water-derived H
2 during corrosion: Fe0 + 2H 2O = Fe2+ + 2OH‚àí + H 2. In the above analysis, 
the abundance of Acinetobacter, Ignavibacteriales , and Shewanella  was relatively higher compared to 
A4, which confirmed the practicability of zero valent iron in an anaerobic digestion system.

Therefore, the addition of zero-valent iron changed the microbial community in the system, and furtherInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 806 12 of 15
changed the anaerobic digestion process. This was mainly due to its strong reductive property, and
zero-valent iron is expected to provide electrons for methanogenesis by producing water-derived
H2during corrosion: Fe0+2H2O=Fe2++2OH +H2. In the above analysis, the abundance of
Acinetobacter, Ignavibacteriales , and Shewanella was relatively higher compared to A4, which conÔ¨Årmed
the practicability of zero valent iron in an anaerobic digestion system.
In terms of electricity production, Acinetobacter secretes an unidentiÔ¨Åed endogenous compound
similar to pyrroloquinoline quinine and conducts extracellular electrontransfer in MFCs [ 50].
Meanwhile, it is reported that Arcobacter could contribute to the generation of electricity, with
acetate as an electron donor, as they have been isolated from MFC reactors [ 51]. It was found that
Acinetobacter distributed more in A3 and Arcobacter distributed more in A2, which was responsibile for
the higher electrochemical performance.
Previous studies have proved the feasibility of employing Shewanella for bioaugmentation on
MFC performance [ 52]. Newton et al. [ 53] pointed out that Shewanella , which is a widely applicable
strain of electroactive microorganisms with a superior capacity for extracellular electron transport,
was selected to represent the pure culture inoculum and to develop pure culture MFC-biosensors.
Furthermore, Shewanella was discovered by Myers & Nealson in Lake Oneida, New York, and has
been used extensively for Fe reduction in many di erent systems. They were the Ô¨Årst to report the
stoichiometric coupling between microbially mediated Fe reduction in clay minerals and the oxidation
of organic carbon to CO 2, using the Fe(III)-reducing bacterium Shewanella putrefaciens strain MR-1 with
formate or lactate as the carbon source [ 54]. This may be the reason for the low capacity of power
generation in A4 because of the lack of zero-valent iron while A2 had the best performance.
In the current research, few reports indicated the e ect of zero-valent iron at the acclimation stage
in MFC, most of which attempted to improve the electrical performance of MFC by modifying the
electrode material or adding agent after the successful start-up of MFC. The invention, by directly
adding exogenous zero-valent iron in the domestication stage, using sludge containing iron as an
anode substrate to acclimate and enrich electro-producing bacteria in the anode, can not only greatly
shorten the start-up time of MFC but also enhance the electricity production of the MFC. Furthermore,
this study explained the basic principle of an electro-anaerobic digestion system with zero-valent iron
supplementation to the MFC, which provided a practical attempt for further research. In addition,
increasing the performance of power generation of the MFC by adding zero-valent iron is practically
applicable, because it considers that zero-valent iron or discarded iron Ô¨Ålings can be used as raw
materials, which are low in price, highly recyclable, environmentally friendly, and in line with the
essence of sustainable development.
4. Conclusions
Zero-valent iron was added into MFCs‚Äô anaerobic reactor at di erent doses to enhance the
electricity generation during the start-up stage in this work. According to the experimental results,
the voltage and power density were improved by the zero-valent iron addition. When 0.5 g of
zero-valent iron was added, the maximum values of the voltage and power density were 289.6 mV
and 27.3 mW /m2, accordingly changing the structure of the bioÔ¨Ålm and enriching the electro-active
microorganisms on the anode electrode, as shown by by SEM observations. Also, carbon felt with
zero-valent iron supplemented exhibited relatively superior electrochemical activity and a shifted
positive peak oxidation potential as well as decreased resistance, illustrating the much better oxidizing
reaction and more active metabolism of exoelectrogens on the surface of the electrode. It was observed
that the quantity and diversity of microbial communities was increased, especially Shewanella , which
are responsible for electrical generation. In the community, the Proteobacteria phylum was the most
abundant in all samples and it was present at higher percentages in both A2 and A3 (56‚Äì64%) than other
samples (39‚Äì51%). These results suggested that the performance and anerobic biological community
of MFCs can be improved by adding zero-valent iron.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 806 13 of 15
