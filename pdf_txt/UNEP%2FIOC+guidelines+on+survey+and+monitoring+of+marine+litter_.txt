 iiiForeword 
Marine litter is found in all sea areas of the world – not only in densely populated regions, but also in 
remote places far away from any obvious sources.  Marine litter originates from many sea-based and 
land-based sources and causes a wide spectrum of environmental, economic, safety, health and 
cultural impacts. The very slow rate of degradation of most marine litter items, mainly plastics, together 
with the continuously growing quantity of the litter and debris disposed, is leading to a gradual, but 
dramatic increase in the quantities of mari ne litter in our oceans and world shores. 
In response to the global challenge posed by ma rine litter, UNEP’s Regional Seas Programme (RSP) 
and the Global Programme of Action (GPA) embarked in 2003 on the development of a ‘Global 
Initiative on Marine Litter’ . Although marine litter is found in all oceans and sea areas of the world, 
this initiative focuses on the establishment and deve lopment of pilot regional activities in twelve 
regions (Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Ea st Asian Seas, Eastern Africa, Mediterranean Sea, 
Northeast Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, Red Sea an d Gulf of Aden, South Asian Seas, South East 
Pacific, and Wider Caribbean) that are particularly affe cted. The global initiative also provides a global 
platform for the establishment of partnerships, coop eration and coordination of ac tivities for the control 
and sustainable management of marine litter. Most  of these activities have been developed by 
UNEP/RSP in close cooperation with the secretariats  of participating Region al Seas Conventions and 
Action Plans and in consultation and, when appropriate,  in cooperation with UN Agencies, including 
IOC of UNESCO, FAO and IMO.  
The problem of marine litter was recognized by the U.N General Assembly (UNGA), which in its 
Resolution A/60/L.22 (Nov. 2005) calls for national, regional and global actions to address the problem 
of marine litter. This resolution notes the lack of  information and data on marine debris, encourages 
States to develop partnerships with industry and civil society, urges States to integrate the issue of 
marine debris within national strategies dealing with waste management; encourages the development of appropriate economic incentives to address th is issue, and encourages states to cooperate 
regionally and subregionally to develop and implem ent joint prevention and recovery programmes for 
marine debris. A number of regions and countries have taken some steps to address the marine litter issue but despite all these efforts there are indications that the marine litter problem keeps growing. 
As recognized in the UNGA Resolution one of the sign ificant barriers to addressing marine litter is the 
absence of adequate science-based monitoring and assessment programmes t hat will provide useful 
information, from which the most critical impacts of litter, on national, regional and global scales can 
be determined.  Changes in accumulation rates and composition, trends over time and the 
effectiveness of management systems are also hard to assess without good monitoring 
methodologies. Although monitoring of marine litter is  currently carried out within a number of 
countries around the world, the methods of surv ey and monitoring used tend to be very different, 
preventing comparisons and harmonization of data across regions or time-scales. 
In order to confront this problem the Regional Se as Programme of UNEP launched, in full cooperation 
with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commis sion (IOC) of UNESCO, the development of the 
UNEP/IOC Guidelines on Survey and Monitoring of Marine Litter  that will assist policy makers and 
support efforts by regions, countries, Regional Se as Programmes and other relevant organizations to 
address the problem of monitoring and assessment of marine litter. 
These Guidelines include a comparative analysis of information from around the world on existing 
experience and methods for surveys,  monitoring, reporting protocols and assessment of marine litter. 
The compilation of the information and the development of the Guidelines were carried out by a group 
of experts from all around the world and representin g all oceans, lead by Prof. Anthony Cheshire of 
Australia and supported by the Government of Australia. UNEP and IOC wish to thank all the 
scientists and individuals who took part in this project! 
It is a hope by all organizations and individuals involv ed in the preparation of these Guidelines that 
they will be adopted and implemented for years to come by the relevant international and national 
organizations, regions and countries.

 ivAcknowledgments 
I would like to acknowledge the substantial effo rts by the many people who contributed to the 
development of these guidelines. Although some of you are listed as co-authors it is important that 
your contributions should not be un derstated so the following is int ended as a thankyou to the many 
people who helped in this project. 
I would like to make special mention of the work  by Ellik Adler whose vision, drive and enthusiasm 
took the project from inception to completion. Ellik has led the way, working tirelessly to illuminate the 
issues and challenges we all face in dealing with the problems of marine litter.  
Each and every one of my co-authors provided invaluable help and assistance in locating source 
material, reviewing ideas and concepts and providing the advice, feedback and critical review that 
were essential to developing this document. Wherea s each of you came with a different background 
and bought different experiences to the table your w illingness to work collectively was central to us 
reaching a consensus on some very challenging issues. 
The contributions by Ljubomir Jeftic, Seba Sheavly, Yuval Cohen and Alexander Tkalin were also 
greatly appreciated for the help t hey provided in developing the initial framework for the project and 
also for their tireless contributions editing and reviewing the final document. Grant Westphalen is also 
thanked for his ongoing support and assistance and parti cularly for his support in developing the first 
complete draft of the document.  
No project can be completed without the support of the people who make things happen behind the 
scenes. This project benefited enormously from the work of Julian Barbiere and his team at the IOC 
who worked with UNEP to manage and administer the project, the UNEP team including Peter Manyara provided ongoing logistic and technical s upport and our workshop in Thailand was a success 
largely due to the hard work and planning from Srisuda Jarayabhand and her team. To all of these 
people a warm thankyou for your help and assistance. 
Ilse Kiessling (representing the Government of Australia) was prominent in contributing her 
knowledge, ideas and not least - access to her library - which helped to get the project off the ground 
and through to completion.  
To all of you – it was a great pleasure working with  you and I sincerely hope th at our efforts will make 
a difference in helping the world to address the complex and challenging problems of marine litter.

Large Marine 
Ecosystem Large marine ecosystems (LMEs) represent large, continuous ocean areas 
(typically around 200,000 km2) that have relatively distinct hydrography and 
bathymetry. LME’s typically encompass coastal bays and estuaries and extend 
out to the edge of the adjacent conti nental shelf. Importantly they represent 
areas with a high degree of physical, bi ological and ecological connectivity with 
constituent trophically dependent populations. 
The system of LMEs has been developed by the US National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to assist in the identification and characterization of areas of ocean for conservation purposes. GLOSSARY AND ACRONYMS

Litter 
Characterization System used to classify different types  of litter. Many different systems have 
been used in the literature including grouping litter based on its material 
composition (e.g. plastic vs wood vs meta l), form (e.g. bottl es vs crates vs 
sheets) or source (e.g. recreational activities vs  fishing vs commercial 
transport). In this report a comprehens ive litter characterization scheme has 
been developed that uses both material composition and form. 
Litter Monitoring Repeated surveys of beaches, sea bed and/or  surface waters to determine litter 
quantities such that information can be compared with baseline data to see if changes occur through time and / or in response to management arrangements.
Litter Survey Structured set of procedures to prov ide a quantitative assessment of the 
amount of litter in a given location.

Marine Litter Waste, discarded or lost material resulting from human activities – marine litter 
is any such material that has made it into the marine environment, including 
material found on beaches or material that is floating or has sunk at sea. In 
some countries organic material (e.g. faeces or food waste) are included as litter. In this document organic waste has not been included and we only 
consider manufactured materials (incl uding processed timber). Materials of 
natural origin, including seagrass or algal wrack and other vegetation, are 
explicitly excluded.

UNEP Regional 
Seas Programme The Regional Seas Programme was launched in 1974 in the wake of the 1972 
United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm, Sweden. 
Currently, eighteen regions are covered by the Regional Seas family. Thirteen 
regional seas programmes have been established under the auspices of UNEP. The East Asia (COBSEA), Eastern Africa  (Nairobi Convent ion), Mediterranean 
(Barcelona Convention), Northwest Pacifi c (NOWPAP), West and Central Africa 
(Abidjan Convention) and Wider Caribbean (Cartagena Convention) programmes are directly administered by UNEP. The Black Sea (Bucharest 
Convention), Northeast Pacific (Antigua Convention), Red Sea and Gulf of Aden 
(Jeddah Convention), ROPME Sea Area (Kuwait Convention region), South 
Asian Seas (SAS, SACEP), Southeast Pa cific (CPPS, Lima Convention) and 
South Pacific (SPREP, Noumea Convention) programmes are independently administered by their regional secretaria ts. Furthermore, five regional partner 
programmes are in place in the Antarc tic (CCMLAR), the Arctic (PAME), the 
Baltic Sea (Helsinki Convention, HELC OM), the Caspian (Teheran Convention) 
and Northeast Atlantic (Oslo Paris Convention, OSPAR). 
The RSP aims to address the accelerating degradation of the world's oceans 
and coastal areas through the sustainable management and use of the marine and coastal environments, by engaging neighbouring countries in 
comprehensive and specific actions to protect their shared marine environment. 
In total more than 140 countries participate in regional programmes thus the RSP is one of the most globally comprehen sive initiatives for the protection of 
marine and coastal environments.

Visual survey A litter survey conducted by visual assessment rather than by physical 
collection of litter items. Typically visual surveys ar e used when litter items can 
be seen (observed) but not collected, for example, when using underwater 
cameras or when observing from planes or ships travelling at sea.

 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 1Executive Overview 
Background to the development of operational guidelines 
Globally our awareness of both t he pervasiveness and magnitude of marine litter and the associated 
environmental and social problems is growing (R ibic et al. 1992, ANZECC 1996a, GESAMP 2001, 
Kiessling 2003, Cho 2005, UNEP 2005, OSPAR 2006, HELCOM 2007). This growth in knowledge is 
being paralleled by a concomitant increase in t he number and scope of national and international 
marine litter investigations and assessment programmes. The objectives underpinning these litter assessment programmes are quite diverse with gro ups/organizations variously targeting increased 
public awareness, better understanding  of the risks and impacts of litte r, more understanding of litter 
sources and sinks to support improved managem ent and not the least, cleaner waterways and 
beaches at local, regional, national and international scales. This variety in the purpose of assessment 
programmes is matched by the diversity in t he operational structure of those programmes. 
Regardless of the underpinning motivation, marine litter investigations will generally fall into one of 
three basic types: 
1) Beach litter surveys. 2) Benthic litter surveys, which include: 
a) Observations made by divers, submersibles or camera tows. 
b) Collection of litter via benthic trawls. 
3) Floating litter surveys, which include: 
a) Observations made from ship or aerial based platforms. 
b) Collection of litter via surface trawls. 
Ultimately, to effectively manage and thereby mitigate the impacts from marine litter, there is a need to 
develop a good understanding of the problems and spec ifically to increase our knowledge about the 
principle types and sources of litter and the beha viours that result in litter entering the marine 
environment. To achieve this aim, there is a need to ensure that good quality data are available that 
will allow comprehensive analyses of the nature and so urces of litter in marine environments and how 
these vary through time and in response to management interventions. 
In spite of growing interest and a mounting body of ev idence from research a nd surveys, it is widely 
accepted that a major factor that limits our knowle dge of (and therefore the ability to manage) marine 
litter results from inconsistencies in the design and delivery of sampling and assessment programmes. 
These inconsistencies largely result from a lack of consistent objectives and litter classification 
systems between alternative monitoring programme s (Ribic et al. 1992, ANZECC 1996a, Cheshire 
and Westphalen 2007).  
There is a growing need to develop standardized oper ational guidelines for marine litter survey and 
monitoring programmes so that litter levels on ou r beaches and within our seas and oceans can be 
estimated and interpreted through long-term, broa d scale comparative studies that will support 
management at both national and international scales . Similarly, given that marine litter management 
ultimately relates to social and behavioural chang es, there is a need to develop or maintain public 
awareness and education through simpler, less rigidly structured, programmes.  
Objectives  
The objectives for this study were to develop a set of standardized operational guidelines for the conduct of beach, benthic and floating litter asse ssments. In working to achieve this outcome it 
became clear that there was also a need to address the different underlying purposes, particularly in 
relation to beach litter assessments, and to that  end we have developed tw o classes of surveys: 
1) Comprehensive surveys for beach, benthic and floating marine litter 
These protocols are targeted at the collect ion of highly resolved data to support the 
development and/or evaluation of mitigation strategies in coastal and marine systems. The 
protocol for these surveys includes a highl y structured framework for observations at 
regional, national and international scales. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 22) Rapid surveys for beach litter 
This protocol comprises a simplified version of the comprehensive beach survey, targeted 
primarily at developing public awareness and education about marine litter issues and is thus 
not constrained by the need to fit within a br oader spatio-temporal comparison framework. 
Such surveys may be used as a vehicle fo r broader based community engagement and in 
building community capacity when working towards inclusion within the comprehensive 
survey framework. 
In developing the guidelines marine litter was defi ned as any waste, discarded or lost material, 
resulting from human activities, that has made it into the marine environment, including material found 
on beaches or material that is floating or has sunk at sea. Some organic materials (e.g. faeces or food 
waste) have been explicitly excluded and we do not include naturally sourced materials such as 
vegetation (e.g. seagrass wrack, algae or river sourced trees and branches ). Organic materials have 
only been included where they have been through some form of processing (e.g. cloth and processed 
timber). 
Scope of this report 
As noted by the United Nations General Assembly Resolution (A/60L.22), one of the most significant 
barriers to addressing the global problem of marine litter is the absence of information that can be 
used to determine the sources, the movement and paths, the oceanographic dynamics, the trend and the more general status of marine litter. This kind  of information is basic and mandatory in order to 
assess the impact of marine litter on national, regional  and global scales. The absence of harmonized 
and globally agreed upon scientific methodologies to monitor changes in accumulation rates and the composition of litter, and the effectiveness of mana gement arrangements over ti me are critical issues 
that require the development of appropriate guidelines. 
In order to address this problem the Regional Seas  Programme (RSP) of UNEP, together with the IOC 
of UNESCO, and with the support of the Governm ent of Australia, within the context of the ‘Global 
initiative on marine litter’  initiated the work on developing guidelines for the ‘standardization’ and 
harmonization of the survey and monitoring of mari ne litter worldwide. Such guidelines will contribute 
to the global efforts, especially of developing c ountries, to address and abate marine litter and will 
assist scientists, governmental authorities and polic y makers and respective efforts by governments, 
NGOs, Regional Seas Programmes and other relev ant organizations to address the problem of the 
monitoring and assessment of marine litter. 
Within the framework of the collaboration between IOC and UNEP, related to the development of the 
‘UNEP/IOC Guidelines on Survey and Monitoring of Ma rine Litter’, this report aims to outline practical 
operational guidelines for the survey and m onitoring of marine litter and in particular:  
1) To collect information from around the wo rld on existing experience and methods for the 
monitoring and assessment of marine litter drawing on information already compiled by 
UNEP, OSPAR, HELCOM, the Australian Department of the Environment and Water 
Resources, the Ocean Conservancy’s NM DMP and other relevant sources.  
2) To develop a comparative analysis of select ed methodologies for marine litter survey and 
monitoring, including reporting protocols and forms. 
3) To develop a set of practical operational guide lines on survey and monitoring of on-shore, 
floating and sea-floor marine litter for consistent application worldwide. These guidelines 
include advice on the format and organization of data needed to support statistical and 
trend based analyses.  
The survey design, guidance and data recording protocols are intended to support comprehensive 
surveys and monitoring as well as rapid surveys suit able for application by community-based or other 
non-research trained personnel. 
Given the extensive logistical require ments for surveys of fl oating and benthic litter, it is not practical to 
develop rapid assessment surveys for either floating or benthic litter. It is recognized however, that 
community groups may well participate in ad-hoc  clean-up and removal operations for floating or 
benthic litter which may then be reported in general terms (e.g. total volume or weight of material 
collected).  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 3Similarly, while there is broad agreement about th e importance of microplastics (a component of 
neustonic litter) as a threat to wildlife (Derraik 2002, Lattin et al. 2004), investigations into this type of 
litter are technically demanding and require specialist equipment and training (see Lattin et al. 2004); 
specific survey guidelines for this form of litter have not been included. 
Approach used in developing guidelines 
In order to organize the preparat ion of the Guidelines, the RSP of UNEP and the IOC of UNESCO, 
with the support of the Government of Australia, established an international Technical Working Group 
(TWG) comprising of sixteen “globally spread” experts  from various regions and countries of the world. 
The TWG began work in July 2007 with support from UNEP and IOC; Prof. Anthony Cheshire from 
Australia took the lead role in the project and acted as a Chief Scientist, Team Leader and Coordinator 
of the TWG. 
The TWG undertook a detailed review of 13 different  sampling protocols that are currently being used 
around the world to survey beach cast, benthic and/o r floating marine litter. Survey protocols were 
assessed against 46 criteria related to the basic stru cture of the survey, the an alysis of sampling units, 
the frequency and timing of surveys, the systems used  for litter classification and the underpinning 
framework for facilitation and management of logistics.  
Results of this review were summarised and then used to determine the best way to structure different 
types of litter surveys. The outcomes from this wo rk have been incorporated into the development of 
these Operational Guidelines. In framing these recommendations a set of draft guidelines were 
reviewed by all members of the TWG and these were  further developed during a workshop held in 
Phuket, Thailand during May 2008. Following this workshop the results were compiled into an agreed 
set of operational guidelines to support the delivery of marine litter surveys. 
In total four sets of guidelines have been developed, one for each of: 
1) Comprehensive assessments of beach cast litter; 
2) Assessments of benthic litter; 3) Assessments of floating litter; and 
4) Rapid assessments of beach cast litter. 
Chapter I presents an introduction to marine litte r and the associated problems. General information 
about the application of these guidelines in a global / regional framework is detailed in Chapter II while 
the detailed methodology for each of the guidelines  is presented in Chapters III-VI. Appendix A lists 
the TWG membership while Appendix B provides a su mmary of the findings from the review of the 
various litter assessment programmes that fo rmed the background to these guidelines.

 4INTRODUCTION TO MARINE LITTER 
 
 5Chapter I. Introduction to marine litter 
Despite international, national and local prohibitions (e.g. ANZECC 1996a, GESAMP 2001, Kiessling 
2003, NRC 2008), the level of manufactured litter lost  or deliberately discarded into the world’s seas 
and oceans is substantial and represents a growing threat to marine environments and industries (e.g. 
ANZECC 1996a, b, Barnes 2002, Kiessling 2003). Mari ne litter accumulates on virtually all coasts from 
the poles to the equator (e.g. Haynes 1997, Convey et al.  2002) and at least some form of litter can be 
found on almost any beach anywhere in the world, irrespective of its remoteness from domestic 
sources. Litter may originate from many sources including (e.g. Jones 1995, ANZECC 1996a, 
Kiessling 2003, NOWPAP 2007a, Otley and Ingham 2003): 
• commercial and recreational fis heries and aquaculture operations 
• vessels – including cargo, bulk carrier, militar y, surveillance, research, passenger ships 
and non-commercial pleasure craft 
• stormwater and urban run off 
• wind blown from land 
• riverine inputs 
• beach users, including deliberate illegal dumping 
• offshore oil rigs 
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ( MARPOL 73/78 ) is a major 
international treaty on marine litter and pollution contro l for which Annex V relates to garbage. Across 
the world, various countries enact this treaty through legislative arrangements (e.g. in Australia 
through the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 ). It needs to be 
understood however that, although MARPOL provides so me control over litter from shipping, it does 
not prohibit discharge of all material from vessels. Fu rthermore, other sources of litter (e.g. lost fishing 
gear or land based sources such as domestic discards ) represent a substantial, and in some parts of 
the world an even greater, source of litter into marine and coastal environments. 
Other international and regional legal instruments have been developed to cover some of these other 
litter sources including the London Dumping Convention1 which addresses dumping at sea and the 
Barcelona Convention which addresses marine litter from land-based sources.  
Nevertheless, irrespective of the legislative framewor k, prosecutions fo r illegal disposal of marine litter 
are rare (e.g. Rees and Pond 1995, Derraik 2002) becau se the tracing of litter to the source is often 
difficult or impossible (ANZECC 1996a, Kiessling 2003).  
Marine litter – the problem 
For the purposes of the guidelines devel oped herein, the definition of marine litter2 includes any 
manufactured or solid waste entering the marine envir onment irrespective of the source (see Coe and 
Rogers 1997). Marine litter can thus be categorised into several diverse classes of material (e.g. Ribic 
et al.  1992, ANZECC 1996a, Kiessling 2003, Otley and Ingham 2003, Edyvane et al.  2004), including: 
• plastics (e.g. moulded, soft, foam, nets, ropes, buoys, monofilament line and other 
fisheries related equipment, smoking related items such as cigarette butts or 
lighters) 
• metal (e.g. drink cans, bottle caps, pull tabs) 
• glass (e.g. buoys, light globes, fluorescent globes, bottles, etc) 
• processed timber (including particle board) 
                                                      
1 The "Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dump ing of Wastes and Other Matter 1972", was one of the first 
global conventions to control pollution of the sea through the dumping of wastes and other matter. There are Currently, 85 
States are Parties to this Convention. In 1996, the "London Protocol" was agreed to further modernize the Convention and, 
eventually, replace it. Under the Protocol all dumping is prohibited, except for possi bly acceptable wastes on the so-called 
"reverse list". The Protocol entered into force on 24 Ma rch 2006 and there are currently 36 Parties to the Protocol. 
2 Note that the terms “debris” and “litter” are variously us ed throughout the literature. In some cases they are used to 
differentiate between marine sourced material  (debris) and locally sourced material (li tter). In this report the terms are used  
interchangeably although preference is given to the word “litter”.  INTRODUCTION TO MARINE LITTER 
 
 6• paper (including cardboard) 
• rubber 
• cloth 
Furthermore, in some countries organic material (e.g. faeces or food waste) are also included as litter. 
In these guidelines organic waste has not been in cluded although we do include processed timber. 
Conversely, materials of natural origin, including seagrass or algal wrack and other vegetation, are 
explicitly excluded. 
The range and scale of impacts from marine litter are diverse (e.g. Dixon and Dixon 1981, Laist 1987, 
Jones 1995, GESAMP 2001, Moore et al.  2001, Barnes 2002, Derraik 200 2, Kiessling 2003, Otley and 
Ingham 2003, UNEP 2005, NRC 2008) and include:  
1. Environmental 
a. entanglements and ghost fishing 
b. ingestion (intestinal blocka ge, malnutrition and poisoning) 
c. blockage of filter feeding me chanisms from small particulate (neustonic) plastic debris 
d. physical damage and smothering of reefs, seagrasses, mangroves 
e. potential to vector marine pests including invasive species. 
2. Social 
a. loss of aesthetics and / or visual amenity 
b. loss of indigenous values 
c. antagonism against perceived polluters 
d. perceived or actual risks to health and safety 
3. Economic 
a. cost to tourism (loss of visual amenity and obstruction to beach use) 
b. cost to vessel operators (downtime and damage due to entanglements) c. losses to fishery and aquaculture operations due to damage or entanglements 
d. costs for clean up, animal rescue operations, recovery and disposal 
4. Public Safety 
a. navigational hazards (loss of power or st eerage at sea is potentially life threatening) 
b. hazards to swimmers and divers (entanglements) 
c. cuts, abrasion and stick (puncture) injuries 
d. leaching of poisonous chemicals 
e. explosive risk (gas cylinde rs frequently wash ashore in northern Australia, similarly 
dumped military ordinance is a problem off the Irish coast) 
Litter accumulation in our seas and on our beaches depends upon both the rate at which litter is 
entering the system and the rate at which it is re moved or decays. Estimate s for the rate of litter 
accumulation in the world’s seas and oceans va ry substantially. The highest estimates suggest 
accumulation rates as high as 7 billion tonnes per annum (GBRMPA 2006) a figure which may be an 
over-estimate
3. Conversely, the lowest estimate of 6.4 million tonnes per annum, although based on a 
comprehensive assessment, is now quite dated (National  Academy of Sciences 1975). Irrespective, it 
is generally agreed that both the current levels and the rates of input are increasing (e.g. Ryan and 
Maloney 1993, Barnes 2002, Derraik 2002) in spite of measures targeted at controlling the problem 
(Williams et al. 2005, National Academy of Sciences 2008). The ever increasing use of plastics that 
both float and degrade very slowly (Laist 1987) means that litter will remain in the system for 
protracted periods and over that time it may travel  substantial distances (Derraik 2002). Derraik (2002) 
also suggested that while it is difficult to reliably estimate the amount of plastic entering the marine 
environment the quantities are substantial. 
                                                      
3 While estimates vary considerably other  sources suggest that plastic production wo rld wide is around 5 kg per annum for every 
person on earth. Given that plastics typically make up 50%-70% of litter items then as a worst case (assuming all plastic 
produced ends up in the sea) marine litte r production rates would be around 60,000,000 million tonnes. Although the figure of 7  
billion tonnes is often reported it is unlikely to be correct and is probably 2-3 orders of magnitude above the real level. INTRODUCTION TO MARINE LITTER 
 
 7The longevity of many litter components (especially glass and plastics) is widely accepted (e.g. Clarke 
1986, Laist 1987, UNEP 1990, UNEP/IOC/FAO 1991, The Ocean Conservancy 2006). A piece of 
paper the size of a parking ticket might last a month,  cigarette butts will last from 1-5 years, a plastic 
bag for 20-30 years, aluminium cans from 80-500 years but glass and plastic bottles can last much longer (UNEP 1990, The Ocean Conservancy 2006). The Ocean Conservancy International Coastal 
Cleanup Coordinator Handbook lists 21 different types  of litter, obtained from the US National Parks 
Service, with decomposition times of 2-4 weeks for paper towels up to 1 million years for glass bottles 
(The Ocean Conservancy 2006). However, these va lues will vary substantially according to 
environmental conditions such as sun exposure, part icularly UV levels, temperature, oxygen level, 
wave energy and the presence of abrasive factors (sand,  gravel or rock). There is also uncertainty in 
our understanding of persistence; Clarke (1986) for exam ple, suggests that plastic containers will last 
around three years, substantially less than the 20-30 years suggested by the US National Parks 
Service (The Ocean Conservancy 2006). Note that, while fragmentation of litter is not the same as 
decomposition, this process may enhance the break down rate or at the very least change the nature 
of the risks presented by litter to marine biota or ecosystems.  
More research is needed into litter decomposition rates under different environmental conditions so 
that the half-lives for different li tter types can be quantified. Data on half-life will assist in identifying 
residence times in the oceans and on beaches as well as targeting management strategies at those 
litter types that are both damaging and persistent (e.g. changing the material composition to 
preferentially select material t hat decomposes more rapidly).  
Lost and discarded fishing gear is a primary cause for environmental, economic and public safety 
concern (Jones 1995, Kiessling 2003), but plastics ar e far and away the most pervasive of marine litter 
items for which ingestion by marine biota can lead to  major health issues and frequently death (Laist 
1987, Moore et al.  2001, Derraik 2002). Although in general terms netting and monofilament line could 
be included under plastics, some surveys of marine litter analyse this component separately in order 
to differentiate these risks (Kiessling 2003, White 20 05) and because there is little confusion as to the 
source. While it is possible that fishing nets may be lost from poorly maintained storage or dumping facilities, derelict nets can generally be attributed to maritime origins. The same cannot be said for 
other beach litter, particularly items that occur fr equently (e.g. smoking related items, plastic bags, 
bottles, etc), which are generally derived from land based sources (i.e. transport via rivers and drains 
or via deliberate dumping and discards).  
The need to improve marine litter reporting systems 
To effectively manage, and thereby mitigate the impa cts from marine litter, there is a need to develop 
a good understanding of the problem and specifically to understand the principle types and sources of 
litter in the marine environment. To achieve this ai m there is a need to ensure that relevant, quality 
data are available that allow a comprehensive anal ysis of the nature and sources of litter and how 
these are changing through time and in response to management interventions. 
Beach surveys of accumulated marine litter are t he most common means of estimating loads in the 
sea (e.g. Ribic et al.  1992, ANZECC 1996a, b, Rees and Pond 1998, Kiessling 2003, Stuart 2003). 
However, in spite of growing interest and a mount ing body of research, it is widely accepted that a 
major factor that limits our understanding of (and th erefore the ability to manage) marine litter, is the 
lack of clearly identified objectives and inconsistencies in sampling design and litter classification 
systems between litter surveys. These inconsistenc ies are such that they prevent or severely 
confound the analysis of spatial and temporal patterns (e.g. ANZECC 1996a, b, GESAMP 2001, 
Kiessling 2003).  
Even when sampling methods are similar, comparat ive studies are often compromised by a lack of 
information on factors influencing the depositional environment (prevailing winds, local and offshore 
currents, proximity to land based sources) for the different sampling areas (ANZECC 1996b). In such 
cases, even when differences in litter loads can be demonstrated between sites it is difficult to 
interpret these because the so urces of the variability remain  unknown. The development and 
evaluation of global strategies fo r the management of marine litter are thus hampered by an inability to 
compare and contrast litter levels between different regions. 
There is growing need therefore, to develop standar dized marine litter sampling guidelines such that 
litter levels within coastal and marine systems c an be estimated and interpreted through long-term, 
broad scale comparative studies that will supp ort management at both national and international 
scales (e.g. Wace 1995, ANZECC 19 96b, Kiessling 2003, Stuart 2003, Edyvane et al.  2004, Cho 
2005, HELCOM 2007, NOWPAP 2008, Sheavly 2007). INTRODUCTION TO MARINE LITTER 
 
 8Lifecycle model for marine litter  
A key challenge in developing guidelines for the assessment of marine litter is to identify the major 
processes that control the entry and / or removal of litter from the oceans and also the transformations 
that occur during the lifecycle of any given litter it em (e.g. when floating litter sinks to become benthic 
litter or is cast onto a beach to become beach cast litter).  
In developing any sampling strategy it is neces sary to establish a model of the system being 
investigated which makes explicit the various as sumptions about how the system works. In the 
following we provide a systems model that describes the dynamics of marine litter from source to sink. 
This model can be used to visualise the “lifecycle” of marine litter by tracking the various pathways that 
litter can take from the point of discard and thr ough the system until it is  eventually removed or 
decomposed. The model, represented schematically in Figure 1, provides a simp lified view of the key 
parameters and processes that can be measured or inferred from an appropriately configured marine 
litter sampling strategy. 
In summary, the model identifies a set of key state variables (rectangular boxes) that represent “pools” 
of material that are in dynamic flux within the sy stem. These pools include Floating litter, Benthic litter 
and Beach cast litter. The size of the litter pools ar e defined in terms of quantities of material (e.g. 
tonnes of floating litter or the num bers of particular items) and ther eby represent the sum total of 
material within the system under consideration.  
 
Figure 1. Schema representing the lifecycle of marine litter.  
 
Dynamical processes (indicated in Fi gure 1 by arrows) illustrate the fl ux rates or movement of litter 
from one pool to another. These va lues are measured and reported as  rate functions (e.g. tonnes of 
litter discarded per year or tonnes of litter being ca st onto beaches per year). In general terms these 
flux rates can be measured either directly, by obser vation of amounts of material being transported, or 
indirectly through inferences based on changes in the amounts of litter in each pool over time. 
The model can be used to illustrate some simple truths about the longterm options for the 
management of marine litter including: Discards
DecompostionCollectionMarine litter pools
Floating

Fragmentation
Decomposition may take between weeks (paper and cardboard) to 
thousands or even millions of years (plastics and glass). The rates of input far exceed the rate of decomposition.We may be able to keep 
popular beaches clear of litter 
but litter collection is both expensive and logistically 
difficult. For oceanic systems 
it is almost impossible. Managing discard behaviour 
is ultimately the only practical route for combating 
marine litter problems. By 
preventing discards the other problems take care of 
themselves.
Fragmentation is not the same as decomposition. Smaller (fragmented) 
litter presents different sorts of risks to marine systems. While large items may present entanglement risks, smaller items represent 
ingestion risks. Even heavily fragmented items (e.g. microplastic 
particles), present risks to the trophic structure of ecosystems.Discards

 91. For as long as the input processes (Discard ) exceed the removal processes (Collection and 
Decomposition) then the amount of litter will increase through time resulting in more litter in 
the oceans and on the beaches. 
2. Given that decomposition is slow (particula rly for some of the persistent and more toxic 
plastic forms of litter) then this will never be a solution to the marine litter problem. In some 
cases material engineering may provide alternat ive materials that decompose more rapidly; 
increased rates of decomposition would then result  in a reduction in the size of the litter pool. 
3. The key point of control in the system is  through the management of discard behaviours. If 
we can reduce inputs we have some chance  of managing the downstream environmental 
consequences. Improvements are needed in wa ste management and reception facilities in 
ports and harbours, education of  beach goers is essential to reduce domestic discards and 
improved management of rubbish dumps, particul arly those in coastal catchments, are all 
required to reduce inputs to the system. 
Management of marine litter can be informed by obtai ning good quality data on the size of each of the 
pools and the rates of exchange between them. This allows us to articulate a set of useful objectives for any national or international programm e of marine litter surveys. These being:  
i) To provide information about the sour ces of different types of litter, and  
ii) To quantify the amount of litter in different ocean systems. 
To achieve these objectives, litter assessment guidel ines must explicitly incorporate an awareness of 
the “life-cycle” of marine litter into the design, to support quantification of the key response variables 
and to allow an analysis of the efficacy of various management interventions.  
In the absence of better management at source, the exponential growth of litter in the marine 
environment is certain to continue (Barnes 2002).  The need to develop and evaluate alternative 
management strategies is therefore central if we aim to limit the amount of litter entering marine 
systems. In 1975, the annual influx rate of litte r to the world’s oceans was estimated at six millions 
tonnes (National Academy of Sciences 1975)
 ; current rates are likely to be substantially greater. 
Given the prolonged timeframe for decompositi on (UNEP 1990, The Ocean Conservancy 2006) and 
the very small amounts of litter actually removed through beach clearances (The Ocean Conservancy 
2006), it can be argued that the volume of marine litter in the oceans will continue to increase 
exponentially over coming decades.  
 INTRODUCTION TO MARINE LITTER

 11Chapter II. Establishing a framework for litter assessment 
Introduction 
To achieve better management outcomes in addressing the problems of marine litter there is a need 
to ensure that relevant, quality data are available to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the nature 
and sources of litter and to quantify changes across  regions, through time and in response to 
management interventions. 
In this chapter guidelines are presented to support t he establishment of a framework within which litter 
assessments (beach, benthic and floating litter) c an be conducted. The primary objective is to 
establish a framework for managing the integration of  individual litter assessment activities across 
broad geographical regions. In this context, region s may comprise sub- or supra-national areas where 
there is a unified system for coordinating and / or managing litter assessments. Typically regions may 
comprise UNEP regional seas areas that span natio nal boundaries or, in the cases of countries such 
as Australia, national or sub-national programmes that cover management or planning areas. 
The regional framework aims to support: 
1) Quantification and characterization of mari ne litter for the purposes of developing and 
evaluating the effectiveness of management, control, enforcement and/or mitigation 
strategies in particular integration with solid waste management. 
2) Understanding of the level of threat po sed by marine litter to biota and ecosystems. 
3) Provision of comparable datas ets to support national, regional and global assessments of 
marine litter. 
Framework for developing operational guidelines 
The methods (detailed in the following chapters) for beach, benthic and float ing litter assessment have 
been developed from a number of existing survey prot ocols that collectively have a track record of 
application in various regions around the worl d. Significant amongst these were the OSPAR, 
NOWPAP and the NMDMP protocols (Appendix B) which collectively provide:  
1) Proven frameworks for delivery of long term, large scale marine litter surveys using trained 
(although often voluntary) survey participants. 
2) Frameworks that support the development of litter summaries at a variety of spatial and 
temporal scales. 
3) Methodologies that collectively satisfy most of  the key criteria detailed in the comparative 
analysis of the alternative survey protocols (Appendix B). 
4) Methodologies that are rigorous but still fl exible enough to encompass a range of different 
litter management objectives. 
5) Methodologies that have the capacity to address quality assurance and quality control 
issues. 
Litter assessments need to be planned to ensure that they sit within and across the context of a 
broader regional management framework (Figure 2)  and are delivered consistent with the defined 
protocols. In turn, these protocols need to includ e the definition and specification of the survey 
location, choice of sampling units, methodology for colle ction, classification and quantification of litter 
and a process for data integration, an alysis and reporting of results. 
Three aspects of this framework need to be structured to ensure integrity across regions and to 
support national, regional and global analysis of litter data. These are: 
1. Effective and culturally approp riate systems for the recruitment and training of field staff and / 
or volunteers. 
2. Establishment of a system for selecting litte r survey sites at national and regional levels; and 
3. Standardisation of the system used to classify  and quantify litter (to support comparisons over 
broad regional and global scales. ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR LITTER ASSESSMENT

Figure 2. Steps in developing a marine litter assessment. 
Recruitment and management of staff and volunteers 
Any long term marine litter assessment programme will require a specific and focussed effort to recruit 
and train field staff and volunteers. Consistent, high quality training is essential to ensure data quality 
and needs to explicitly include the development of operational (field based) skills. Staff education 
programmes should incorporate specific information on the results and outcomes from the work so that staff and volunteers can understand the c ontext of the litter assessment programme. 
Whereas most guidelines (AMDS,  NMDMP, NOWPAP – Beach, OSPAR, CCAMLR, CCI and NDNHI) 
recommend the use of the same personnel in all su rveys through a programme , the maintenance of 
volunteer enthusiasm and continuity  can be quite difficult (especially for long running – 5 – 10 year 
programmes) with a concomitant need to find and tr ain replacement field teams (Sheavly 2007).  
Sheavly (2007) concluded that wh ile volunteers were effective, e fficiencies could be greatly enhanced 
through integration of the sampling within local resource management programmes. This could include 
support from national parks, resource managers, fisheries and tourism managers as well as non-
government organizations. 
In developing a programme it needs to be recogniz ed that volunteers typically come from a wide 
variety of backgrounds; by way of example t he NMDMP volunteers included retired corporate 
executives, technicians, educator s, local conservation organizers, middle and high school science 
classes, college students, U.S. Naval and Coast Gu ard offices and other members from the private 
sector (Sheavly 2007). 
This diversity will bring with it differences in  knowledge and experience and these need to be 
addressed when developing a voluntee r programme. In summary there are a number of key issues 
that need to be considered when engaging volunteers in marine litter assessments and these include (adapted from Sheavly 2007): 
i. Volunteers need to be properly trained with  hands-on training exercises and supportive training 
materials and programme manuals that detail responsibilities and procedures. 
ii. Local coordination and management is needed to ensure that volunteers are available when 
needed and monitoring schedules are followed. 
iii. Effective and frequent communication is a key element in keeping volunteers engaged and up-
to-date with the programme activities, including ho w their monitoring activities are supporting 
resource and conservation management efforts. 
iv. Succession plans are needed to ensure that as some volunteers retire or leave the programme, 
new volunteers are trained to provide replacements. 
v. Regular recognition efforts of the volunteers and t heir efforts can be effective in maintaining their 
involvement in the monitoring programme (e.g. media coverage, presentations by monitoring 1. Regional

memorabilia including t-shirts, hats, etc.). 
vi. The monitoring programme needs to be realistic in terms of the expectations of labour and the 
length of time needed to conduct this type of study.  
vii. Programme managers need to make regular visits to  sites to ensure that training is relevant and 
appropriate to the needs of the su rvey. Ideally follow-up visits should be scheduled to coincide 
with re-training efforts and other activities.  
viii. Volunteer managers, who may often be volunt eers themselves, need appropriate training to 
ensure that they have the skills to  manage a volunteer workforce. 
ix.  Ideally local partnerships may be developed with stat e or municipal agency staff to facilitate the 
monitoring and integration of volunteer management, training and programme delivery.  
x. Where appropriate, typically for remote surveys or where local people are limited by financial or 
other resources, monetary support may be required to cover transportation expenses related to 
their efforts.  
xi. While the very nature of a volunteer is not to expect anything in return for his/her efforts, people 
do like to know that their efforts are meaningful and appreciated.  
 
In more general terms the following issues are also relevant when managing volunteer programmes 
(adapted from the “Model Code of Practice for Org anisations Involving Volunteer Staff”; Volunteering 
Australia 2007): 
i. Interview and employ volunteer staff in accordance with anti discrimination and equal 
opportunity legislation; 
ii. Provide volunteer staff with orientation and training; 
iii. Provide volunteer staff with a healthy and safe workplace; 
iv. Provide appropriate a nd adequate insuranc e coverage for volunteer staff; 
v. Define volunteer roles and develop clear job descriptions; 
vi. Differentiate between paid and unpaid roles; 
vii. Provide appropriate levels of s upport and management for volunteer staff; 
viii. Provide volunteers with a copy of  policies pertaining to volunteer staff; 
ix. Provide all staff with information on grievance and disciplinary policies and procedures; 
x. Acknowledge the rights of volunteer staff; 
xi. Offer volunteer staff the opportunity for professional development; 
xii. Reimburse volunteer staff for out of pocke t expenses incurred on behalf of the organization; 
xiii. Treat volunteer staff as valuable team me mbers, and advise them of the opportunities to 
participate in agency decisions; and 
xiv. Acknowledge the contributions of volunteer staff. 
 
All large scale marine litter surveys also have manu als and/or field guides to assist volunteers, most 
notable are those developed for the ICC and NMDMP (The Ocean Conservancy 2002, US 
Environment Protection Agency 2002, Sheavly 2007).  
Field guides and litter identification tools are an im portant element in the maintenance of sampling 
consistency. Importantly, care should be taken to ens ure that the development of  guides is sensitive to 
language and cultural issues. For example, guides fo r surveys involving indigenous Australians should 
contain warnings that they may include images or the names of deceased persons. Issues of this 
nature highlight the need to obtain the support of locally based managers as the point of liaison 
between volunteers and higher level survey management. 
Framework for selecting survey locations 
Identification of appropriate sampling “locations” (Step 2 in Figure 2) is a precursor to establishing the 
basic sampling units within any litter survey programm e. Accordingly, there is a need to consider the 
process by which survey locations are chosen. Ideal ly locations should be selected with reference to 
regional management or resourcing arrangements as well as their utility in providing meaningful data 
about litter dynamics. Typically, mana gement arrangements will not only consider larger regional scale 
assessments but in most ca ses, will also need to a ddress the requirements at  smaller scales (sub-
regions and countries or other geographical sub-divisions).  
Regions, for the purposes of litter assessment s, are best defined as large domains wherein 
management arrangements can be relied upon to provide broad coordination of litter survey 
programmes. Globally a variety of such domains al ready exist including international networks (e.g. ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
 14the UNEP Regional Seas Programm e Areas (RSPA); Figure 3) and nat ional networks such as those 
that define the sampling programmes for the NMDM P in the USA or the proposed arrangements for 
implementation of the AMDS in Australia (see e.g. Figure 3). 
Regional coordinating units (RCU) associated with the various Regional Seas Programme areas (see 
glossary) currently manage marine litter investigat ions such as those o perating in the NOWPAP, 
COBSEA and MAP regions. Elsewhere, regional or national coordinators manage the OSPAR, 
NMDMP and CCAMLR programmes.  
For larger countries it may be necessary to sub-divide the coast to align with management 
arrangements. In Australia, for example, the AM DS programme (Cheshire and Westphalen 2007) has 
identified eight principal marine planning zones (F igure 3) whilst in the USA the NMDMP identifies 
nine coastal sub-regions (Sheavly 2007). Conversely , smaller nations (such as the small island 
nations in the Caribbean) might contribute surv ey data to a broader framework based on marine 
ecosystem boundaries. In such cases, although individual countries may only have a single sampling location, ideally all countries within a region will ha ve at least one sampling location to contribute to 
regional programmes. 
 
To be useful in delivering both regional and local scale coordination the management framework 
needs to be able to support the collection of meani ngful data across countries and broader regions as 
well as to accommodate a degree of overlap in operational management, data structures and the management questions being addressed. 
The broader framework for litter surveys may thus be realized through cross-linking the fundamental 
sampling units (i.e. beaches or other near-shor e locations) within classes based on their 
representation of broader geopolitic al regions/sub-regions as well as across countries and/or Large 
Marine Ecosystem (LME) areas.  
Such a structure can be accommodated within a dat a integration and analysis system using a 
relational database structure where “Sampling un its” represent the core (unique) element and 
information about national, regional or LME membership comprise descriptors for each sampling unit (Figure 4). 
The use of a relational database approach to manage the informati on will then permit analyses to be 
conducted by aggregating and summarising data against any of these criteria (i.e. by Region, Country 
or LME; Figure 4). In the example shown (Figure 2; Figure 4) an analysis by RSPA would include data 
from all 3 sample units (they are all within the COBSEA area) whereas an anal ysis by LME would only 
include the Thailand and Malaysian samples (Bay of Bengal LME) with the Australian sample being analysed separately as part of the NW Australia Shelf Seas LME. a) 
 b)

or b) Australian Bioregional Planning areas. Such programmes could be used to establish a framework for the management (and analysis and integration of results) of comprehensive 
regional beach litter assessments. 
ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
 15Ideally regional coordinators would be appointed to work across regions which may be either the 
RSPAs or National Programmes depen ding on the size and number of sample units being managed. 
The regional coordinator would have responsibilit y for managing the data obtained from sampling units 
within that management area. This person would also  be responsible for the recruitment of location 
managers (see below), data integration and they ma y also provide support for volunteer training 
and/or community education.  
Overall a management structure incorporating clear lines of communication to and from the 
centralised management agency is critical to the development and maintenance of a larger scale 
survey (Sheavly pers. comm.). Accordingly, locati on managers would need to work closely with a 
centralised management organization (e.g. Ocean Conservancy in the case of the NMDMP) to ensure effective outcomes.  
 
Illustrative data table 
 
Figure 4.  Schematic data relationships with illustrative data table – Sample units (i.e. 
beaches or near-shore locations) form the central data entity while information about Large Marine Ecosystems (LME), Regional Seas Programme Areas (RSPA) or Country are 
additional elements related to each sample unit and used to facilitate analyses with different 
geographical perspectives (e.g. based on LME or RSPA). 
 
Framework for litter classification  
The second major element of any regional framework is the adoption of a unified system for 
classifying litter items. Such a system will be a re quisite part of any attempt to develop national or 
regional syntheses of litter data.  
In broad terms existing survey prot ocols fall into one of three types: 
1. Low resolution surveys that distinguish 1-6 different litter categories as seen in the two 
operational and floating litter survey s (CCI, FAP and Japan Floating);  
2. Medium resolution surveys (30-60 litter cat egories) used in most other surveys (NMDMP, 
NOWPAP – Benthic, KMMAF, CCAMLR and WWF); and  Regional Seas

 163. High resolution (90 + litter categories) us ed in three surveys; the AMDS, OSPAR and 
NOWPAP – Beach survey protocols (the  latter using the NPEC data sheets)4.  
From a research perspective, it can be argued that a higher resolution in litter classification (i.e. the 
classification of litter into a greater number of di screte classes) will provide the best opportunity to 
analyse and interpret data. Conversely, a fewer number of  classes is likely to result in a lower error 
rate and therefore provide more consistency in data co llection as well as making it easier to train and 
support survey staff and volunteers.  
In these guidelines, the system for litter classification has been chosen to ensure a good balance 
between resolution and operational efficiency. Th e recommended system comprises a two level 
hierarchy that identifies items firstly by material co mposition (e.g. plastic vs. glass vs. rubber, etc) and 
then by form (e.g. bottles vs. sheets vs. fishing nets, etc). This classification system comprises a list of 
10 different material classes and a total of 77 discrete types of litter (Table 1).

survey protocol (now operated by NRETA) contains more than  180 different net types that may be identified within litter 
collections (White et al. 2004). ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR LITTER ASSESSMENT

It should be noted that the classification system in  Table 1 can be adapted for use in surveys where 
more detailed litter classifications are currently appl ied (e.g. OSPAR). This can be effected simply by 
using the litter code shown in Table 1 and then adding a decimal identifier to provide for further 
subdivisions of these classes. For example it may be desirable to differentiate vegetable bags from 
oyster or mussel bags (Code PL19). This could be done by assigning code PL19.1 to vegetable bags 
and PL19.2 to mussel or oyster bags. Providing th is nomenclature is documented in the database then 
it will not impact on the overall data quality of the system.  ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
 18The litter code associated with each of these diffe rent types of litter will need to be used to record 
information on all data sheets (see e.g. Table 2; except for remotely observed litter data where the 
codes in Table 3 should be used instead). Litte r codes are recorded on the sheet along with 
information about the amount of each item collected. If  for example a survey results in the collection of 
25 plastic bottles (comprising 20 small, < 2L and t he remaining large), 4 light globes, 10 cardboard fast 
food trays and 3 mesh vegetable bags then the data would be recorded as shown in Table 2.

In developing a regional framewor k the litter data can be further augm ented with information about the 
sources of the litter in the environment. This is best  achieved using a relational data structure (similar 
to that used to record location) with litter code as the core piece of data and additional information 
about material composition, form and source recorded in parallel.  
Where litter is observed remotely, for example in  some benthic or floating litter surveys, the 
classification needs to be simpler because it is oft en impossible to distinguish items based on material 
composition. A floating bottle may for example be made of plastic or glass but it may not be possible 
to determine which simply by seeing it in the water from a distance. In such cases a less resolved 
classification system is recommended using the Remo te Litter Classes (RLCs) that are principally 
based on the type of object (Table 3). Note that all li tter items identified in Table 1 can be placed into 
one of the RLC categories (Table 3).  ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR LITTER ASSESSMENT

Quantification of litter 
Irrespective of how litter is classified, there is a need to develop a system for quantification in order to 
provide a basis for comparison between surveys.  
Ideally, in situations where litter items are collect ed, both counts and weights should be recorded for 
all litter classes. Alternatively, it is recommended that the litter is weighed (and the quantity reported 
as kg). Recording both counts and weights allows fo r the broadest integration of data and avoids the 
obvious pitfalls (see below) with eit her type of measurement on its own. 
If litter is not collected (and particularly for remote observations), then the amount of litter in each class 
should be quantified by counting items.  
The relative merits of these two approaches for quantification are discussed below. ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
 20Weights of litter within categories 
Weights of litter by categories are relatively easy to obtain and provide a very quick method for 
quantifying large numbers of items that have been collected during a survey. Furthermore, by 
aggregating items within a class and measuring the weight it is possible to rapidly deal with broken or fragmented material (e.g. glass bottles or plastic bag s). In some cases (e.g. cloth or fishing net) the 
weight will be affected by whether the material is  wet or dry and this is a source of error.  
It needs to be recognized however that while a simple  measurement of weight (e.g. that there is 100 
kg of polyethylene sheet) quantifies how much material is present it is very difficult to relate this to 
management or the assessment of downstream ris ks unless you know what that 100 kg comprises in 
terms of individual items. If for example the 100 kg comprises 10,000 plastic bags each of which has 
the capacity to be ingested and kill wildlife then this represents a different scale of problem than if the 
litter comprises a single roll of material.  
Similarly not all types of litter can be weighed, h eavily fouled fishing nets or baulks of timber may 
weigh many tonnes. Practically these cannot be weighed unless the survey team has access to 
specialist equipment (that may not be routinely available
5). 
Counts of litter items within categories 
Counts are relatively easy to make and they do not  require any specialised equipment. In relation to 
litter items such as plastic drink bottles or plas tic bags counts provide a qu antitative indicator of 
relative importance. For remotely observed litter, co unts within types are the only available approach. 
Problems arise however when there are litter items within the same class that may differ substantially 
in terms of size. Counts of derelict fishing nets will grossly underestimate the significance of larger nets (Kiessling 2003) which may vary in size from less than 1 m
2 to 100s or even 1000s of m2. In such 
cases counts are much less useful than a measurement  of weight. Similarly counts are of very little 
use for quantifying heavily fragmented litter items. Ho w, for example, do you count a hundred pieces 
of plastic bottle – is it equivalent to one bottle or many?  
 
                                                      
5 Although it is acknowledged that in places such as northern Australia, where large fishing nets are ubiquitous in the beach ca st 
litter, four wheel drive vehicles equi pped with winches and lifting cranes are a st andard piece of equipment used by survey 
teams. These vehicles allow collection of large items whic h may then be taken back to a central location for weighing and 
subsequent disposal. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR COMP REHENSIVE BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
21 Chapter III. Operational Guidelines for 
Comprehensive Beach Litter Assessment  
Objectives for comprehensive beach litter assessments 
Beach surveys have long been the primary tool for measuring the load of marine litter in 
coastal and marine systems and they also provide an invaluable mechanism for education and building community understanding and awareness.  
Historically, surveys of marine litter ac cumulation on beaches have been the most 
commonly used method for estimating loads in the sea (e.g. Ribic et al.  1992, ANZECC 
1996a, b, Rees and Pond 1998, Kiessling 2003,  Stuart 2003), however, there has been a 
marked lack of consistency in sampling protocols and litter characterization (classification). To address this issue there is a need to develop and implement a 
standardized marine litter sampling protocol such  that the amount of litter within our seas 
and oceans can be quantified and understood through long-term, broad scale, comparative studies (e.g. Wace 1995, AN ZECC 1996b, Kiessling 2003, Stuart 2003, 
Edyvane et al.  2004, Cheshire and Westphalen 2007).  
In this chapter guidelines are presented fo r comprehensive assess ments of beach cast 
litter which have the following primary objectives. 
1. Quantification and characterization of marine litter for the purposes of developing 
and evaluating the effectiveness of manag ement, control, enforcement and/or 
mitigation strategies in particular integration with solid waste management. 
2. Understanding the level of threat pos ed by marine litter to biota and ecosystems. 
3. Providing comparable datasets to support national, regional and global 
assessments of marine litter. 
In developing these objectives it needs to be recognized that data fr om surveys should be 
useful in addressing a number of fundamental questions about marine litter relating to the management, mitigation, sources and risks as sociated with litter in the environment 
(Table 4). In turn, such questions allow ev aluation of the information collected from 
monitoring programmes and thereby assess  its utility in supporting management 
responses.

monitoring programmes.

6 Indicators items for sources represent classes of items that are characterist ic of certain types of users of the 
marine environment. For example cigarette butts are typi cally discarded by beach goers whereas oil containers 
by at sea operations including re creational and commercial boating.  
7 Indicators items for threats represent classes of items t hat may present specific risks to wildlife such as drink 
package rings or discarded fishing nets which present an entanglement risk whereas plastic bags present an 
ingestion risk. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR COMP REHENSIVE BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
22 Beach litter comprehensive survey operational guidelines 
Comprehensive litter assessments need to be pl anned to ensure that they sit within the 
context of regional management frameworks (Chapter II). The key element in developing 
comprehensive beach litter assessments within th e regional framework, is in the definition 
of “beaches” as the core sample unit. 
The methodology for comprehensive beach surveys detailed below has been developed 
with reference to a number of existing survey protocols all of which have a track record of 
application in various regions around the wo rld. Significant amongst these were the 
OSPAR, NOWPAP, NMDMP and AMDS protocol s (Appendix B) wh ich collectively 
provide:  
1. Proven frameworks for delivery of long term, large scale marine litter surveys 
using trained (although often voluntary) survey participants. 
2. Frameworks that support the development  of litter summaries at a variety of 
spatial and temporal scales. 
3. Methodologies that collectively satisfy mo st of the key criteria detailed in our 
comparative analysis of the alternat ive survey protocols (Appendix B). 
4. Methodologies that are rigorous but still  flexible enough to encompass a range of 
different litter management objectives. 
5. Methodologies that have the capacity to  address quality assurance and quality 
control issues. 
It needs to be recognized that none of the exis ting protocols was deemed sufficient in its 
own right to qualify as the model for global  adoption; instead we have adapted the best-
practice elements from across the different su rvey protocols to ensure we have a system 
that fully addresses the requirements. 
Beach selection and characterization 
When undertaking beach litter assessments as  part of a regional programme there is a 
need to: 
1. Identify and select suitable beaches to allow the establishment of appropriate 
sampling units; and 
2. To develop a survey schedule to ensure that data are collected as required over 
the lifetime of the study. 
Ideally, at least 20 beaches should be selected  per region, with a minimum of one beach 
in each of the representative countries. Note  that replication of beaches (choosing more 
than one) within countries or even sub-regions is desirable.  
Care needs to be taken to account for differenc es in the spatial intensity of the sampling 
programme between areas within a region.  
Data from replicates should be aggregat ed and standardized by total length of beach 
surveyed, before any analysis that atte mpts to elucidate regional patterns. 
Selection of beaches for marine litter surveys should follow the approach detailed in the 
NMDMP (which are similar to the OSPAR and AMDS criteria; Sheavly 2007, OSPAR 
2007, Cheshire and Westphalen 2007), al though the need for sandy beaches should be 
relaxed such that gravel beaches can also be  included. The basic beach selection criteria 
(see e.g. Figure 5) should therefore include: 
• A minimum length of 100 m (i.e. sufficient to fit the smallest sampling unit) 
although beaches with small amounts of litter may need to be longer (e.g. 1 km); 
• Low to moderate slope (15 – 45º), which precludes very shallow tidal mudflat 
areas that may be many kilometres wide at low tide; OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR COMP REHENSIVE BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
23 • Clear access to the sea (not blocked by breakwaters or jetties ) such that marine 
litter is not screened by anthropogenic structures; 
• Accessible to survey team s year round, although some consideration needs to be 
given to sites that are iced-in over wi nter and the difficulty in accessing very 
remote areas; 
• Ideally the site should not be subject to any other litter collection activities, 
although it is recognized that in many pa rts of the world large scale maintenance 
cleaning is carried out periodically; in such cases the timing of non-survey related 
beach cleaning must be known such that li tter flux rates (the amount of litter 
accumulation per unit time) can be determined (see sampling frequency below); 
• Survey activities should be conducted so as not to impact on any endangered or 
protected species such as sea turtles, sea birds or shore birds, marine mammals 
or sensitive beach vegetati on; in many cases this w ould exclude national parks 
but this may vary depending on local management arrangements. 
• Although the NOWPAP and OSPAR selection cr iteria specify that sites should 
not be within close proximity to ri vers, harbours and ports (NOWPAP 2007b, 
OSPAR 2007) it is recommende d that within the above co nstraints, the location 
of sampling sites within each zone should be stratified such that samples are obtained from beaches subject to different litter exposures, including: 
• Urban coasts (i.e. mostly terrestrial inputs); 
• Rural coasts (i.e. mostly oceanic inputs); 
• Within close distance to major riverine inputs. 
Each survey location will require a location manager who is responsible for liaison with 
the regional coordinator as well as for re cruiting survey volunteers, organising field 
operations, data collation and quality assurance sampling for each survey. 
At each location data need to be collected relating to the depositional environment and 
proximity to litter sources including:  
Aspect. Prevailing wind (from meteorological data). 
Beach curvature. 
Total beach length. 
Nearest river – name, distance, direction and whether or not it inputs directly to the 
beach. 
Nearest town – name, distance and direction. 
• Estimated number of person visits per year (based on a 10n scale i.e. <10, <100, 
< 1,000 etc). 
• Main beach usage (i.e. recreational – swimming and sunbathing, fishing, surfing, 
boat access or remote). 
• Access (vehicular, pedestrian and/or boat only). 
Beach slope should be measured at the start and end point of each transect.  
The shape of the beach profile should be desc ribed at transect start and end points. A 
beach can be linear, concave, convex  or sinusoidal/tiered in shape. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR COMP REHENSIVE BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT

Figure 5. Long Beach near Robe in South Australia provides a good example of the 
type of beach that should be employed in a litter survey. Photograph G. 
Westphalen September 2007. 
 Offshore reefs and seagrass beds should be apparent while setting up each transect. 
However, this information should be chec ked against other sources because the 
difference between reef and seagrass beds may not be obvious. 
Tidal distance should be measured as the linear  distance from the highest strandline to 
low water level at the start and end of the sampling unit. Tidal range provides a basis for measuring slope, although very wide or flat beaches might prove difficult (hence the need 
for modest beach slope).  
Tidal range should be obtained from published tidal data.  The back of the beach should be described in terms of the dominant features, be it 
dunes, vegetation or built structures (rock walls, r oad, path, fence, etc).  
• Any other noteworthy information (e.g. an otherwise remote and unvisited 
location may be subject to an annual surfing competition that results in a “pulse” 
of litter).  
This information only needs to be collated once for each site. Once recorded in the 
database the information will be us ed for all future surveys.  
Much of this information can be obtained from maps and similar sources (e.g. Google 
Earth™ images), although such information should be checked by direct observation at 
the site.  
Sampling units 
Within regions the basic sampling unit for beach litter surveys is a fixed section (length) of 
beach from which measurements of litter load are made periodically. It is expected that 
survey teams will go back and re-survey the same sampling units over an extended 
period of time (e.g. every 3 months for a period of 5 or more years). 
Data on litter from beach surveys will be analysed as the amount of litter (e.g. number of 
items, weight or volume) per unit length of be ach per unit of time (generally the period 
since the last clean-up operation or survey).  OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR COMP REHENSIVE BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
25 Sampling units of 100-1000 m will achieve the most pragmatic balance between areal 
coverage and the amount of effort required to  complete the survey within an acceptable 
time allocation (i.e. preferably less than th ree hours). There are good arguments for using 
both shorter and longer transects; in the O SPAR region for example, litter volumes on 
many beaches are such that it is not pr actical to sample more than 100 m of beach 
(although for larger litter items they use 1,000 m sampling units). In Australia it is common 
to use replicate 1,000 m sampling units because litter loads are generally much lower and 
therefore a single 1,000 m sample is unlikely to provide a good estimate for many beaches particularly those in remote areas (See Appendix B – Question 6: Sampling 
Units and Replication for more information as well as methods for determining the optimal 
length of sampling units). 
Sample length is measured along the curve of the beach at the mid-point between the 
low tide mark and the back of the beach. Each  sampling unit represents the entire area 
along each transect from the water’s edge (prefe rably surveyed at low tide) to the back of 
the beach (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Relationship between a typical sampling unit and the beach on which it is 
positioned. All litter from the water’s edge to the back of the beach is collected 
along the length of the sample unit (e.g. 100m). 
 
The back of the beach needs to be explicitly i dentified using coastal features such as the 
presence of vegetation, dunes, cliff base, r oad, fence or other anthropogenic structures 
such as seawalls (either piled boul ders or concrete structures).  
Smaller sampling sub-units may also be employed for ubiquitous items such as cigarette 
butts but these do not form part of the standard methodology. Typically these sub-units 
should be 10 m wide strips from the water line to the back of the beach, preferably positioned at the start and end point for each larger transect where they are easily GPS 
referenced. 
Additional requirements for a sampling unit include: The start and end points of each sampling unit should be GPS referenced
8 and fixed for 
subsequent surveys. These points will also mark the location of any sub-units. Whereas

26 the start and end points of the main transect can be marked with wooden stakes care 
should be taken to ensure that this does not cont ribute to litter in its own right. Ideally no 
equipment should be left on the beach. 
1. If more than one sampling unit occurs on a beach the minimum separation 
distance shall be at least 50 m (a lthough note the discussion about pseudo-
replication and nested designs; see Appendix B – Question 6: Sampling Units 
and Replication). 
Sampling frequency 
An important distinction exists between survey  protocols that estimate the flux rates of 
litter when compared with those that measure the standing crop of litter. Comprehensive 
surveys need to quantify not just standing crop but rather the flux rate (accumulation rate) 
of litter coming onto the beach. Flux  rates are the preferred measurement9 because they 
can be used as a proxy for estimating oceanic litter levels (Ribic et al. 1992, see also 
Appendix B).  
In order to measure flux rates one must calcul ate the rate at which litter accumulates (i.e. 
the amount of litter arriving on a given le ngth of beach over a given period of time 
expressed as [unit quantity of litter] per [uni t length of beach] per [unit time]) as opposed 
to standing crop which measures the amount of  material on the beach (i.e. [unit quantity 
of litter] per [unit length of beach]). This di stinction between the asse ssment of flux rate 
rather than standing crop is one of the fundamental differences between the 
comprehensive and rapid assessment protocols. 
The need to estimate flux rate has a direct influence on definition of the sampling 
frequency which, unless there are other clea ning programmes on beaches, will define the 
period over which the flux rate is calculated. 
The minimum sampling frequency for any site should be annually. Ideally it is 
recommended that locations be surveyed every three months (allowing an interpretation 
of results in terms of seasonal changes). Quar terly sampling is consistent with the AMDS 
and OSPAR protocols (OSPAR 2006, Cheshire and West phalen 2007). The NMDMP 
uses a monthly sampling regime (Sheavly 2007). Some consideration should be given to 
tropical regions where there are essentially only two seasons as well as high latitudes 
where access is likely to be restricted due to extreme remoteness and/or through being 
iced-in. 
In order to obtain data on litter flux rates there is a need to undertake an initial beach 
clearance in order to remove all accumulated litter. This initial clearance will provide a 
clean slate against which future samples can be assessed. Data on litter may be 
collected from this clearance operation (which may serve as a training exercise), but this 
data cannot form a component of general analyses10.  
For beaches that have periodic maintenance cl eaning, the timing of the survey should 
aim to maximize the subsequent interval. It is  critical that the period of accumulation 
between clearances (be they for survey or ma intenance cleaning) is known such that flux 
rates can be standardized (i.e. amount of litter per unit of beach per unit of time). It should 
be apparent that an advantage of using litter loads relative to beach length and accumulation time allows some flexibility in  timing of surveys. However, given that 
beaches are in constant but often highly variable flux (either accumulating or degrading 
                                                     
 
9 Standing crop (total amount of litter on a beach) rela tes to ocean litter load and time between clearances 
(either natural storm deposition and removal or human clean up operations). Conversely, flux rates (amount of 
litter arriving on a beach per unit time) are comparable to es timates of catch per unit effort in a fishery system 
and thereby provide a direct estimate of ocean litter load. It is important to recognize however that flux rates are 
difficult to calibrate because individual beaches may have very different depositional or remobilization 
characteristics and strictly speaki ng these factors need to be understood (or estimated) before comparisons 
between beaches can be made. 
10 The first clearance of a sampling unit can only provide data about st anding crop. Flux rates can only be 
determined by measuring the amount of litter that arrives on a beach over a fixed period of time. By making an 
initial clearance the litter load is set to zero. A future survey can then estimate the litter load (e.g. kg/km) and, 
because the time interval since the beach was cleared is known, then this value can be transformed to a flux 
rate (e.g. kg/km/month). OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR COMP REHENSIVE BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
27 and often both process occur simultaneously), care should be taken with respect to the 
sizes of the intervals being compared (i.e. t he annual litter accumulation rate at a site will 
most likely not be the same as 12 times the monthly rate). 
It is recognized that some litter survey me thods rely on counting items but not removing 
them from the beach. In practice such an  approach does not readily lend itself to 
estimates of flux rate but technically flux rate s may still be calculated: the standing crop at 
the initial count would be recorded as the number of litter items per unit length of beach 
this number would be subtracted from the c ount per unit length at the next survey and the 
flux rate recorded as the change in number of litter items, per unit length of beach, per 
unit time.  
Laying out a typical survey 
Depending on the number of survey team  members, the survey process can be 
undertaken in either of two ways (consist ent with the NMDMP protocol; Sheavly 2007). 
Surveyors form skirmish lines either parallel to the coast (typically >5 persons) or at right 
angles to the coast (2-5 persons; Figure 7 a and b respectively). In both cases there 
should be around 2 m between persons forming the line. 
All litter, within the sampling unit, that is larg er than 2.5 cm in the longest linear dimension 
should be collected into carry bags. Smaller litter items that may be very common, such as cigarette butts, can be considered in 10 m wide sub-units at the start and end of each 
transect (if required; see sampling units above) . Upon completion of the collection, the 
litter must be sorted into classes (see A ppendix C) and quantitatively measured. On 
completion of the survey all should be disposed  of appropriately, ideally by transport to a 
properly managed waste reception facility. W here possible, facilities that undertake to 
recycle wastes should be selected preferentially.  
 
 
In addition to characterization of the litter, additional data that must be recorded at the 
time of the survey, include: 
• Survey date. 
• Survey start and end times.  
Figure 7. Beach litter surveys can be undertaken in either of two ways; a) surveyors form 
skirmish lines parallel to the coast (> 5 persons)  or b) surveyors form skirmish lines at right 
angles to the coast (2-5 persons). In both cases there should be around 2 m between 
persons forming the line with each person responsible for noting or collecting all litter in the 
area between themselves and the person on the adjacent line.

28 • Date on which the transect was last clea ned either as a survey or as part of 
broader beach maintenance programme (this is  critical to calculation of flux rates 
– see above). 
• Distance along beach covered by the surv ey – this should be fixed for each 
location (see Appendix B on sampling unit sizes) but may vary if local conditions 
prevent survey of the entire sampling unit. 
• Width of the beach at the time of the surv ey (which should be as close to low tide 
as is practicable) from the current water level to the back of the beach – this may 
be used to standardize litter per unit of beac h area rather than per unit length of 
beach (and thereby provides a basi s for converting data to the NOWPAP 
reporting format). 
• Number of persons on the survey team – this should include the survey leader 
and the number of collectors and provides a measure of survey effort. People not 
engaged in directly assessing the beach should not be counted (i.e. support 
people engaged in litter sorting and those assigned the task of collecting heavy items should not be included in the count). 
• Any large litter items that cannot be safe ly moved by the survey group (these 
should be separately marked – see below). 
• Any other details deemed relevant to the survey. This might include: 
o Information on any entangled fauna enc ountered during the survey (details of 
the organism, nature of entrapment, live or dead). 
o Data on events that may not directly re late to the survey site (i.e. offshore 
storms, shipwrecks, shipping container losses) or alternatively land based 
activities that may result in litter su ch as festivals, car races, fishing 
competitions etc. 
o Conditions at the time of the survey th at might affect the litter collection (e.g. 
cold, hot, rain, snow, high winds) th rough impacting on staff performance. 
Large immoveable objects (abandoned cars, very large fishing nets, baulks of timber, etc) 
that cannot be moved by t he surveyors should be recorded on an additional datasheet, 
with information collected on the nature and location (preferably GPS fixed) for each large 
item. This information will be submitted along with other datasheets to ensure that any 
large item is included only once in subsequent analyses. In addition, the item may be 
marked (preferably with paint), to indicate  the item has been included (Wennecker pers. 
comm.). 
Organization of the survey, collation and tr ansfer of the datasheets, quality control 
sampling and liaison with regional coordinat ors should be conducted through the location 
manager. 
Data sheets 
Three data sheets have been developed for comprehensive beach litter assessments 
including: 
1. Site characterization data sheet (BC 01 – double sided) is used to record 
information on the depositional nature of the environment and proximity to local 
litter sources. This sheet only needs to be filled out once for each beach location. 
2. Litter characterization data sheet (BC02 – double sided) is used to record survey 
specific data including categorization and measurement of litter. This is the basic 
datasheet to be filled in for every survey at each site. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR COMP REHENSIVE BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
29 3. Large items data sheet11 (ML01 – single sided) is used to record data on litter 
items that cannot be removed. This sheet needs to be used for all such items to 
ensure that they are only counted once (i .e. for the survey during which they are 
first encountered even if this is the init ial clearance survey). Subsequent surveys 
should be conducted with reference to previously collected data and ideally a summary of this information should be taken into the field to ensure that these 
items are not recounted. 
Quality assurance 
Quality assurance and quality control should be primarily targeted at education of the field 
teams to ensure that litter collection and ch aracterization is consistent across surveys. 
Investment in communication and the training of the country/regional and local survey 
coordinators and managers is thus critical to survey integrity.  
The use of a laminated pictorial field guide wi th examples of each litter type will assist 
survey team members (particularly volunteers) to be consistent in litter characterization. 
Such pictorial guides may also be published as  field guides and made available over the 
web to increase consistency between survey teams working at more distant (remote) 
locations 
Beach selection and sampling unit layout should be undertaken or ratified by the regional 
and/or country coordinator who will recruit (and  work with) a series of local managers. 
The local manager must ensure that data are appropriately collected and make 
corrections/address issues without dam aging the enthusiasm of volunteers.  
The NMDMP quality assurance protocol require d a percentage of all locations to be 
independently re-surveyed immediately follo wing the scheduled clearance (Sheavly 
2007). The collected litter from the follow-up survey could then be added to that of the 
main collection and may also be used to provide an estimate of the error level associated with the survey. This approach may be similarly employed as a component of these 
guidelines (and may use the same datasheets), wherein (where resources are available) 
the local manager undertakes the follow-up survey. 
Data management platform 
Data collation should be undertaken through an online, relational database management 
system12 under the control and direction of the lo cal managers. Responsibility for review 
and approval of uploaded data should be undertaken  by the regional/country coordinator 
who will clarify any issues with local manag ers. This would ensure a high level of 
consistency within each region as well as cr eate a hierarchy of quality assurance on data 
acquisition. 
The use of such a system will also support comprehensive analysis of the data providing 
the opportunity to undertake statistically robust comparisons through time and between 
survey locations.  
Equipment needs 
Safety is a priority and all field teams need to be equipped with a comprehensive first-aid 
kit. Field team members need appropriate clot hing and footwear, protective gloves, hats, 
sunscreen, wet weather gear, water and food. Major risks to personnel include exposure to heat or cold, stick injuries (e.g. hypode rmic syringes) and muscle/joint injuries 
associated with bending and lifting. Remote op erations must follow appropriate safety 
protocols to ensure personal safety for team members. 
                                                     
 
11 The Large items data sheet (ML01) is used for all types of  marine litter survey including surveys of floating or 
benthic debris. This data sheet may also be used for ad-hoc  observations (e.g. aireal observations or ships of 
opportuinity) to record items of interest such  as shipping containers or derelict fishing gear. 
12 The detailed design of an appropriately configured RDBMS is beyond the scope of this project but it should be 
noted that the NMDMP, OSPAR and AMDS progra mmes all have databases that have been designed or 
developed and any of which should be suitable with a modest level of customization. The key thing would be to 
ensure that litter classification (s ee below) and beach characterization dat a structures were appropriately 
modified to address the flexibility i ssues required of this system.  OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR COMP REHENSIVE BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
30 Survey coordinators should also take responsibility for securing beach access permits 
and other approvals that may be requir ed from local management authorities. 
Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are highly desirable, particularly in relocating and 
determining the length of sampling units. The systems available are increasingly 
affordable and accurate. In addition to a GPS (or as an alternative if a GPS is not available) a digital camera (e.g. mobile phone camera) can be used to provide images to 
support relocation of sampling units. In some cases it may be practical to physically mark 
sites using wooden stakes or marker poles although care must be taken to avoid damage to sensitive habitats. In addition to the above a detailed written description of the location 
of the site and key landmarks will facilitate future surveys. 
Where litter weights are required, battery po wered electronic balances with an operating 
range of 0-10 kg are now routinely available and ideal for weighing smaller collections of 
items. Spring balances are available with a range of weight ratings up to 50 kg (and 
possibly higher). These balances can be used in conjunction with a standard 11 L bucket 
(or similar) to hold material during measur ements. Spring balances have the advantage 
that they do not require electrical powe r and they are generally accurate enough (to 
within 10%) for the purposes of litter char acterization but they must be replaced 
frequently as the spring becomes rusted and worn. 
Digital cameras may also be useful to photograph unknown items (if they are not 
collected) and to record extraordinary event s (e.g. ship wrecks). General equipment 
requirements include collection bags, clip-boards, tape measures, stakes and flagging 
tape all of which are routinely available from most hardware stores. 
A pocket calculator may be useful to sum weights that are collected in batches. 
A sharp knife or shears is useful for cutting away entangled litter (rope, cable, fishing line 
and nets). 
Access to remote areas cannot be achiev ed without appropriate (generally 4WD) 
vehicles. They have the added advantage that  heavy items can often be loaded into the 
tray (particularly if they come equipped with lifting gear) or alternatively dragged to a 
collection point. COMPREHENSIVE BEACH LITTER ASSESSM ENT – BEACH CHARACTERIZATION

     OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR BENTHIC LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
36 OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR BENTHIC LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
37 Operational Guidelines for Benthic Litter Assessment 
Objectives for benthic litter assessments 
A significant proportion of litter that enters the sea remains in the marine environment and much of this 
litter eventually sinks and accumulates on the seabed (termed as benthic litter; UNEP 2005). Benthic 
litter is rarely seen by the general public and theref ore draws little attention or public reaction (Galgani 
et al. 2000). Nevertheless, this litter continue s to pose numerous problems. It is as a potential 
navigation hazard, an impediment to trawl fish ers (OSPAR 2006) and can lead to entrapment or 
smothering of sensitive marine biota (NOWPAP 2007a).  
In this chapter guidelines are presented for comp rehensive assessments of benthic litter which have 
the following primary objectives: 
1. Quantification and characterization of marine litter for the purposes of developing and 
evaluating the effectiveness of management, cont rol, enforcement and/or mitigation strategies 
in particular integration with solid waste management. 
2. Understanding the level of threat pos ed by marine litter to biota and ecosystems. 
3. Providing comparable datasets to support na tional, regional and global assessments of 
marine litter. 
As with all marine litter, effective management of  benthic litter requires good data on the sources of 
litter entering the marine environment, where it occu rs and in what quantities. The following guidelines 
have been developed to provide a basis for such investigations. 
Benthic litter trawl or towed survey operational guidelines 
The methodology for benthic litter assessment has been developed with reference to the well established NOWPAP framework (N OWPAP 2007a) and also using info rmation from the Hawaiian 
Ghost Nets Program (Donohue et al. 2001, Timmers et al. 2005). Two alternative assessment formats 
have been developed including methodologies for: 
1. Benthic surveys using trawls or towed equi pment including benthic trawls, camera tows, 
submersible surveys or side scan sonar; and 
2. Diver visual assessment surveys in shallow water, near shore areas. 
The NOWPAP programme provides advice about conduct of benthic trawl surveys while the US 
Hawaiian Ghost Nets Program has been considered in developing shallow water visual surveys. 
Substantive changes have been made to these me thodologies to ensure that litter classification 
strategies are consistent with those being used for the other surv ey methodologies (see chapters on 
Beach and Floating litter assessments). 
These methodologies were used as a basis for t he operational guidelines because they represent: 
1. Proven frameworks for benthic assessment; and 
2. Methodologies that are rigorously defined but offer sufficient flexibility to encompass a range 
of different litter management objectives. 
In the following sections the two alternativ e approaches to benthic survey have been outlined. 
Benthic litter assessments need to be planned to ensure that they sit within the context of regional 
management frameworks (Chapter II) and are delivered consistent with the defined protocols. In turn, 
these protocols need to include the definition and sp ecification of the survey location, choice of 
sampling units, methodology for collection, classification and quantification of litter and a process for data integration, analysis a nd reporting of results. 
Benthic surveys that require tow ed equipment need to make explicit consideration of the potential 
environmental impact of the operation particula rly as these relate to physical damage to benthic 
environments and the potential for by-catch. Although there is debate as to the nature and extent of 
environmental damage incurred by trawling operations (Collie et al. 2000), alternative approaches to 
gathering sunken debris should be considered. In particular, this should include engagements with the fishing industry along the lines of the “Fishing for Litter” programme employed in the North Sea OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR BENTHIC LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
38 (OSPAR 2006). Indeed, given the ex pense and logistical issues asso ciated with trawling operations, 
as well as legislative restrictions and/or licensing cost of benthic trawl operat ions in many countries, 
“Fishing for litter” programmes may be the only vi able means of obtaining data on benthic debris in 
many systems. 
Not withstanding, if benthic litter surveys, using trawls or towed equipment, are to be undertaken, a 
modified form of the NOWPAP (2007a) approach is recommended using t he standardized litter 
classification system for material that has been eith er remotely observed (i.e. using cameras or side 
scan sonar) or material collected in trawl operations. 
In many cases it may be possible to develop collab orative projects with researchers who undertake 
trawl operations for other purposes (e.g. fishery researchers). In such circumstances the survey 
supervisor will need to balance the l ogistic requirements of litter surv eys against the cost of operating 
independently. 
Given the nature of the equipment and technical experti se involved, it is under stood that trawl surveys 
will not make extensive use of volunteers due to the liability and safety issues. 
Regional considerations 
Whereas the NOWPAP approa ch considers provinces within memb er states this should be aligned 
with the regional framework developed above (Chapter II). At least 20 sampling units will be selected within each region although a higher level of redundanc y (i.e. replication) in sampling units within each 
region is highly recommended. 
Data from replicates should be aggregated at th e site level, and standardized by area surveyed, 
before any analysis that attempts to elucidate regional patterns. 
Trawl site selection and characterization 
Sites should be selected to ensure that they: 
• Comprise areas with uniform subs trate (ideally sand/silt bottom); 
• Are of uniform depth; 
• Focus on areas that are known to generate/accumulate marine litter; 
• Avoid areas where there is a risk of unexploded munitions 
• Avoid sensitive and/or pristine habitats t hat might be damaged by trawling operations; 
• Are areas that would not impact on any endangered or protected species such as sea turtles, 
sea/shore birds or marine mammals. 
Within the above constraints on site selection, sampling units should be stratified relative to sources 
within a region such that there are samples obtained from: 
• Urban coasts (i.e. mostly terrestrial inputs); 
• Rural coasts (i.e. mostly oceanic inputs); 
• Within close distance to major riverine inputs; 
• Offshore areas (major currents, shippi ng lanes, fisheries areas, etc.). 
Sampling units 
A sampling unit will comprise a fixed 5 km × 5 km survey area. The benthos in this area should be pre-
surveyed using either side scan sonar or direct came ra observations. This pre-survey will help 
determine the nature of the trawl gear to be deployed  (e.g. nets or grapples) and should also be used 
to identify areas that need to be avoided (e.g. wh ere benthic obstructions could impact on trawl 
operations). In setting up the pre-survey the area sh ould be sub-divided into twenty five 1 km × 1 km 
sub-blocks which will be individually assessed for trawl suitability. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR BENTHIC LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
39  
Figure 8.  Layout of benthic trawl samples comprising 3 randomly chosen 1 km × 1km sub-
blocks from a 5 km × 5 km sampling unit; a) the pre-survey identifies 20 sub-blocks that are 
suitable for trawling operations from which 3 random sub-blocks are selected for trawling; b) 1 
km × 1 km sub-block showing location of 5 trawl shots. 
 
Having identified which of the sub-blocks is suitable for trawling (candidate sub-blocks; i.e. those with 
no benthic structures or areas of conservation significance) a group of 3 sub-blocks should be 
selected for trawling. These 3 areas should be random ly selected from the candidate areas to ensure 
un-biased sampling of the 5 km × 5 km sample unit. 
Trawl sub-samples 
Once the three sub-blocks have been selected each can then be trawled using either nets or grapples 
(as appropriate given the nature of the litter). Trawl operations should be conducted such that: 
• Ship speed should be restricted to 3-4 knots. 
• Each sub-block should be trawled using five  parallel trawl shots up to 800 m long.  
• The ship should proceed in a straight line agains t the current, so that grapnel (hook) or trawl 
nets are spread out in a line astern. 
• Trawl shots should be separated by a minimum of 200 m. 
Data on all litter collected should be aggregated (summed) across all trawl shots and across all 3 sub-
blocks. Data should be reported per unit length trawled (e.g. assuming shots of 800 m length and a 
total of five shots in each of the three sub-blocks  this will equate to a total trawl length of 15 × 800 m or 
12 km). Litter will then be reported as kg / km. 
Note any unidentified or suspicious looking items should be treated with care as they may be 
unexploded munitions. Survey s upervisors should consider this risk in survey planning.

40 Sampling frequency 
NOWPAP (2007a) recommend t hat benthic surveys sh ould be conducted annually. Given that the 
opportunity exists for some benthic litter surveys to  be conducted in close geographical proximity (e.g. 
offshore) to beach survey sites, then the survey may be conducted at the same time as one of the 
beach surveys. This will then provide an opportun ity for an analysis of the relationship between 
benthic litter loads and the flux of litter onto beaches. 
Litter categories and measurement  
Trawled litter should be classified using the standard categories (see data sheets below) and quantified using weights or number of items as appropriate. 
Benthic litter classification can also occur in the pr e-survey using observations from either camera or 
side scan sonar. However, it needs to be recognized that there will be a lack of precision in litter 
characterization where material is not collected (parti cularly for side scan sonar observations). In such 
cases litter will need to be classified using a subset of the standard classifications based on litter form 
(e.g. all bottles, cans, etc. lumped together regardless of composition – see Chapter II).  
All litter that is collected should be disposed of appropriately ideally by transport to a properly 
managed waste reception facility. W here possible, facilities that undertake to recycle wastes should be 
selected preferentially.  
Data sheets 
Three data sheets have been devel oped in line with the above: 
1. Site characterization data sheet (BL01 – single sided) is used to record information about 
the general area of the 5 km by 5 km survey location. This sheet records information on the 
nature of the benthic habitat and the proximity to  likely litter sources. The sheet should be 
filled out only once for each location. 
2. Trawl litter data sheet (BL02 – single sided) is  used to record survey specific data including 
categorization and measurement of litter. This is  the basic datasheet to be filled in for every 
trawl shot at each site. If multiple trawl shot s are run at any given site then a new sheet 
should be used for each shot. 
3. Large items data sheet (ML01 – single sided) is used to record data on litter items that 
cannot be removed. This sheet needs to be used fo r all items to ensure that such items are 
only counted once (i.e. for the survey during which they are first encountered). Before 
undertaking a re –survey of any site this inform ation should be reviewed to ensure that the 
location of such items is known.  
Data management platform 
Data collation should be undertaken through an online, relational database system13 under the control 
and direction of the local managers.  Responsibility for review and approval of uploaded data should be 
undertaken by the regional/country co ordinator who will clarify any issues with local managers. This 
would ensure a high level of consistency within each region as well as create a hierarchy of quality assurance on data acquisition. 
Equipment needs 
Equipment needs and operational logistics for traw l surveys are extensive and highly specialised (see 
NOWPAP 2007a and related refe rences). The following are general requirements: 
• Configuration of trawl equipment will be dependant on the type of seabed litter and 
geographical conditions; e.g. trawl nets can be of 2 cm mesh size, 2-4 m width, 1 m height 
and 20 m length; alternatively grapples or hooks may be used; 
                                                      
13 The detailed design of an appropriately configured RDBS is bey ond the scope of this project but it should be noted that the 
NMDMP, OSPAR and AMDS programmes all have databases t hat have been designed or developed and any of which should 
be suitable with a modest level of customization. The key thi ng would be to ensure that litter classification (see below) and 
beach characterization data structures were appropriately modified to address the flexib ility issues required of this system.  OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR BENTHIC LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
41 • Rope length has to be determined depending on the water depth, specialist advice on setting 
a trawl should be obtained; 
• Seabed litter should be taken on board with proper equipment such as side rollers; 
• Litter can be sorted directly on board provided de ck space is available, care should be taken 
to ensure safety of personnel through use of protective clothing including gloves; 
• After collection and sorting, facilities are requir ed to safely count and weigh litter; specialist 
lifting and weighing equipment may be required. 
Benthic litter visual survey operational guidelines 
Visual surveys of benthic litter provi de a useful tool for quantification of  litter particularly in near shore 
shallow water areas where litter may regularly beco me entangled with benthic structures such as 
rocky or coral reefs. Such assessments can be used to direct clean-up operations and may be an 
important tool in the management and protection of se nsitive habitats (e.g. marine parks or reserves, 
spawning grounds, etc). 
The key element, in developing shallow water visual surveys, is in the definition of underwater belt 
transects as the core sample unit. A belt transect is an area of the seabed delineated by a long central 
line (of fixed length e.g. 100 m) which is used as a guide for divers who then survey all litter within a 
certain distance (typically 2 m on ei ther side) of the central line. 
Regional considerations 
At least 20 sampling units (i.e. 100 m belt transects ; see below) will be selected within each region 
although replicate transects may be used to increase  areal coverage and to provide a higher level of 
redundancy in sampling units.  
Data from replicates should be aggregated at th e site level, and standardized by area surveyed, 
before any analysis that attempts to elucidate regional patterns. 
Visual survey site selection and characterization 
Sites where belt transects are established should be selected to ensure that they: 
1. Are at depths of less than 20 m deep for diver safety and bottom time considerations (based 
on a maximum non-decompression bottom time of ~ 50 minutes at 18 m depth according to 
DCIEM tables14). Beyond this depth remote methods (i.e. camera tows) should be used; 
2. Focus on areas that are known to  generate/accumulate marine litter; 
3. Avoid areas of potential hazard to divers (e.g . shipping channels, areas with high currents, or 
seal breeding areas with associated shark attack risks); 
4. Have ready access, from support vessel or from shore; 5. Are accessible all year round; if a site is not accessible due to weather or other circumstances 
then data can be adjusted during analysis.  
6. Will not impact on any endangered or protected species such as sea turtles, sea/shore birds, 
marine mammals or sensitive beach vegetation. 
7. Have known depositional characteristics and anthropogenic influences. 
8. Within the above constraints on site selection, sampling units should be stratified relative to 
sources within a region such that samples are obtained from: 
Urban coasts (i.e. mostly terrestrial inputs). 
Rural coasts (i.e. mostly oceanic inputs). 
Within close distance to major riverine inputs. 
                                                     
 
14 Note divers should make their own assessment of bottom ti mes after due consideration of their personal circumstances 
including experience level and previous diving history, consideration of repetitive dive profiles and personal susceptibility. 
DCIEM tables are commonly used for recreational/sport divers  but individual needs should be assessed for any diving 
programme.  OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR BENTHIC LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
42 Sampling units 
While the NOWPAP (2007a) method provides a good basis for diver surveys, the 10 × 10 m sampling 
units recommended in these are probably too small to achieve representativ e coverage. Conversely, 
the manta tow approaches used in the Hawaiian ghost net survey (Donohue et al. 2001, Timmers et 
al. 2005) are more representative spatially, but lack the capacity to deal with small litter items.  
As a consequence, the method for laying out the benthic surveys using divers has been modelled on 
the standardized fish visual census methodology  developed through the ASEAN-Australia Living 
Marine Resources Program (English et al. 1997). This  method has proven very reliable for fish surveys 
and is considered to have direct utility for litter. Th is methodology is operationally very similar to that 
described for beach surveys.  
The major challenge for a diver survey is locating an d swimming the correct transect line and distance. 
A sampling unit (Figure 9) will comprise: 
A 100 m (or longer) belt transect that is r un at a fixed depth parallel to shore.  
Distances should be determined either by laying out a 100 m tape measure or alternatively by laying a 
100 m length of weighted rope across the bottom. The latter can be deployed and retrieved from a 
boat. String lines like those used by cave divers may also be employed.  
The start and end point of the transect should be  identified with marker buoys and recorded using a 
GPS. 
Pairs of divers swim in parallel along either side of the tape/rope/string noting all litter items found 
within 2 m either side of the transect line. If visi bility is less than 2 m then surveys should not be 
attempted.

Figure 9.  Layout for benthic visual litter survey ; divers swim down the transect line and collect 
or record all litter items found within 2 m on both sides of the line. Litter is then recorded in 
terms of either the count of items or the weight per unit of length (e.g. kg / km). 
 
 
Small litter items should be collected but anything larger should be marked (lead-weighted surface 
marker buoys can be carried by the divers and rel eased to mark the location of larger items) for 
possible later removal. 
If more than one sampling unit is located within an area then the minimum separation distance should 
be at least 50 m. 
20 sampling units should be allocated within each region (note that a level of redundancy in sampling 
units within each region is highly recommended). OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR BENTHIC LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
43 Sampling frequency 
The minimum sampling frequency for any site should be annually. Ideally it is recommended that locations be surveyed every three months (allowing an interpretation of results in terms of seasonal 
changes). Quarterly sampling is consistent with the recommendations for comprehensive beach litter 
assessments. Some consideration should be given to  tropical regions where there are essentially only 
two seasons as well as high latitudes where acce ss is likely to be restricted due to extreme 
remoteness and/or through being iced-in. 
Note that previous work under NOWPAP and the Hawaiian surveys was done using annual surveys 
(Donohue et al. 2001, Timmer s et al. 2005, NOWPAP 2007a). 
Litter categories and measurement 
All litter should be classified using the standard lis t (Data sheet BL03). Litter items should be counted 
unless the material is being collected in wh ich case counts and weights may be obtained. 
Data sheets 
Three data sheets have been developed: 
1. Site characterization data sheet (BL01 – single sided) is used to record information about 
the site at which the visual transect has been run. This sheet records information on the nature of the benthic habitat and the proximity to  likely litter sources. The sheet should be 
filled out only once for each location. 
2. Litter characterization data sheet (BL03 – double sided) is used to record survey specific 
data including categorization and measurement of litter. This is the basic datasheet to be 
filled in for every survey at each site. If multip le transects are run at any given site then a 
new sheet should be used for each transect. 
3. Large items data sheet (ML01 – single sided) is used to record data on litter items that 
cannot be removed. This sheet needs to be used fo r all items to ensure that such items are 
only counted once (i.e. for the survey during which they are first encountered). Before undertaking a re –survey of any site divers should familiarise themselves with items on this 
list and ideally note them before commencing the dive.  
Data management platform 
Data collation should be undertaken through an onli ne, relational database system under the control 
and direction of the local managers.  Responsibility for review and approval of uploaded data should be 
undertaken by the regional/country co ordinator who will clarify any issues with local managers. This 
would ensure a high level of consistency within each region as well as create a hierarchy of quality 
assurance on data acquisition. 
Equipment needs 
Safety is a priority and therefore the use of lic ensed dive operators to  undertake surveys, or 
alternatively to provide logistic support to field teams, is highly recommended.  
All field teams need to be equipped with a comprehensive first-aid kit. For diving operations this 
should include oxygen resuscitation equipment  and access to decompression facilities.  
Field team members need appropriate clothing and footwear, protective gloves, hats, sunscreen, wet 
weather gear, water and food. Major risks to personnel  include exposure to heat or cold, stick injuries 
(e.g. hypodermic syringes) and muscle/joint injuries associated with bending and lifting. Remote operations must follow appropriate safety protocol s to ensure personal safety for team members. 
For all dive operations, equipment should be well maintained and supported by vessels of an 
appropriate size and capacity. Good quality communi cations equipment should always be taken on 
the boat including mobile phones and HF, VHF or UHF marine radio equipment as required. 
For laying out transect lines equipment needs include anchored ropes, marker buoys, and tape 
measures.  
Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are highly desirable,  particularly in relocating and determining the 
location of sampling units. The systems available are increasingly affordable and accurate. In the 
absence of a GPS a digital camera (e.g. mobile phone camera) can be used to provide images to OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR BENTHIC LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
44 support relocation of sampling units although only if  operations are conducted sufficiently close to 
shore to identify reference features.  
Where litter weights are required spring balances are av ailable with a range of weight ratings up to 50 
kg (and possibly higher). These balances can be used in conjunction with a standard 11 L bucket (or 
similar) to hold material during measurements. Sp ring balances have the advantage that they do not 
require electrical power and they are generally ac curate enough (to within 10%) for the purposes of 
litter characterization but they must be frequently  replaced as the spring becomes rusted and worn. 
General equipment requirements include collecti on bags, clip-boards, tape measures, stakes and 
flagging tape all of which are routinely available from most hardware stores. 
A pocket calculator may be useful to sum weights that are collected in batches. A sharp knife or shears is useful for cutting away entangled litter (rope, cable fishing line and nets).

     OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR FLOATING LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
49 Chapter IV. Operational Guidelines for Floating Litter 
Assessment 
Objectives for floating litter assessments 
Floating litter can be found in all oceans of t he world where it threatens marine life and marine 
ecosystems as well as presenting risks to fishing a nd maritime transport industries. Floating litter can 
comprise anything from cigarette butts and plastic bags (that present ingestion risks to marine 
animals) to discarded or lost fishing nets (tha t may continue to entangle and kill animals for a 
prolonged period of time) through to large objects like shipping containers t hat may present navigation 
hazards to vessels. Floating litter has also been impl icated in providing a vector for the translocation of 
alien (invasive) species15. 
In this chapter guidelines are presented for comp rehensive assessments of floating litter which have 
the following primary objectives. 
1. Quantification and characterization of marine litter for the purposes of developing and 
evaluating the effectiveness of management, cont rol, enforcement and/or mitigation strategies 
in particular integration with solid waste management. 
2. Understanding the level of threat pos ed by marine litter to biota and ecosystems. 
3. Providing comparable datasets to support na tional, regional and global assessments of 
marine litter. 
Almost all litter that moves around the oceans floats16 and therefore a significant proportion of the litter 
on almost any beach is likely to have spent some of  its time floating in adjacent seas and oceans. An 
understanding of the dynamics of floating litter is  therefore fundamental to developing appropriate 
strategies to manage marine litter in both a global and local context. 
The following guidelines have been developed to provide a basis for such investigations. 
Floating litter trawl sur vey operational guidelines 
The methodology for floating litter assessments presented in these guidelines has been developed 
with reference to the seminal work by Ribic et al. (1992) and the more recent work by Shiomoto and 
Kameda (2005). We also make direct reference to our recommendations for benthic trawl litter surveys (see Chapter IV, which were  derived from NOWPAP 2007a).  
Two fundamentally different approaches to floating litter sampling have been developed comprising: 
1. Trawl surveys where litter floati ng at the surface (and in the top couple of metres) is collected; 
and  
2. Remote observation surveys where floating li tter is assessed but where no litter is actually 
collected.  
Floating litter assessments need to be planned to ensure  that they sit within the context of regional 
management frameworks (Chapter II) and are delivered consistent with the defined protocols. In turn, 
these protocols need to include the definition and sp ecification of the survey location, choice of 
sampling units, methodology for collection, classification and quantification of litter and a process for 
data integration, analysis a nd reporting of results. 
Floating litter surveys that utilise trawl equipment need to make explic it consideration of the potential 
environmental impact of the operatio n particularly as these relate to  by-catch. Although there is debate 
as to the nature and extent of environmental da mage caused by trawling operations (Collie et al. 
2000), alternative approaches to gathering floati ng debris should always be considered.  
                                                     
 
15 Floating litter provides a su rface for the growth of plants and animals whic h are then distributed by wind and currents around  
the world’s oceans; this presents a real ri sk to many coastal environments that alien species will be transported from distant 
locations. The presence of fouling biota on litter can also be used to infer the lengt h of time that a litter item has been in the 
water (although some materials are less likely to support growth by colonising organisms). 
16 Whereas some litter is transported across the seabed this is  unlikely to be mode for long di stance transport as most seabed 
litter is ultimately buried or entangled in seabed structures such as reefs. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR FLOATING LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
50 Litter collected during trawl operations should be categorised using the standardized litter 
classification system (Chapter II); for remote visual assessments a simplified list is recommended 
(Chapter II).  
Given the nature of the equipment and technical expertise involved, it may be assumed that trawl 
surveys will not make exte nsive use of volunteers. 
Regional considerations 
The sampling design for floating litter should be aligned with the regional framework developed above 
(Chapter II). At least 20 sampling units will be selected within each region although a higher level of 
redundancy (i.e. replication) in sampling units  within each region is highly recommended. 
Data from replicates should be aggregated at th e site level, and standardized by area surveyed, 
before any analysis that attempts to elucidate regional patterns. 
Trawl site selection and characterization 
Sites should be selected to ensure that:  
• There is a focus on areas that are known to generate/accumulate marine litter; 
• There is no incidental impact on any endanger ed or protected species such as sea turtles, 
sea/shore birds or marine mammals.  
Within the above constraints on site selection, sampling units should be stratified relative to sources 
within a region such that samples are obtained from: 
• Urban coasts (i.e. mostly terrestrial inputs). 
• Rural coasts (i.e. mostly oceanic inputs). 
• Within close distance to major riverine inputs. 
• Offshore areas (major currents, shippi ng lanes, fisheries areas, etc.). 
Sampling units 
A sampling unit will comprise a fixed 5 km × 5 km survey area ( Figure 10 ). This area should be divided 
into twenty five sub-blocks of 1 km × 1 km. To ensure an unbiased sample a group of 3 sub-blocks should be randomly selected for trawling. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR FLOATING LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
51  
 
Figure 10. a) Layout of floating trawl samples compri sing 3 randomly chosen 1 km  × 1km sub-blocks from 
a 5 km × 5 km sampling unit; b) 1 km × 1 km sub-block showing location of 5 trawl shots. 
 
 
Trawl sub-samples 
Once the three sub-blocks have been selected each c an then be trawled. Trawl operations should be 
conducted such that: 
• Ship speed should be restricted to 3-4 knots; 
• Each sub-block should be trawled using five  parallel trawl shots up to 800 m long;  
• Trawl shots should be separated by a minimum of 200 m. 
• The ship should proceed in a straight line against the current, so that trawl net is positioned in 
a line astern. 
Data on all litter collected should be aggregated (summed) across all trawl shots and across all 3 sub-
blocks. Data should be reported per unit length trawled (e.g. assuming shots of 800 m length and a total of five shots in each of the three sub-blocks  this will equate to a total trawl length of 15 × 800 m or 
12 km). The width of the trawl net (when set) need s to be incorporated to provide a measurement of 
area of sea surface trawled (distance in metres mult iplied by width of trawl net) and the data will then 
be reported as kg of litter per square metre of sea surface. 
Sampling frequency 
Floating litter surveys should be conducted at leas t annually. Given that the opportunity exists for 
floating litter surveys to be conducted in close geogr aphical proximity (e.g. offshore) to beach survey 
sites, then the survey may be conducted at the same time as one or more of the beach surveys. This 
will then provide an opportunity for an analysis of the relationship between floating litter loads and the 
flux of litter onto beaches. 
Litter categories and measurement  
Trawled litter should be classified using the standard categories (see data sheets below) and quantified using weights or number of items as appropriate. 
All litter that is collected should be disposed of appropriately.

52 Data sheets 
Three data sheets have been devel oped in line with the above: 
1. Site characterization data sheet (FL01 – single sided) is used to record information about 
the general area of the 5 km × 5 km survey lo cation. This sheet records information on the 
nature of the benthic habitat and the proximity to  likely litter sources. The sheet should be 
filled out only once for each location. 
2. Trawl litter data sheet (FL02 – single sided) is used to record survey specific data including 
categorization and measurement of litter collected in the trawl. This is the basic datasheet to 
be filled in for every trawl shot at each site. If multiple trawl shots are run at any given site 
then a new sheet should be used for each shot. 
3. Large items data sheet (ML01 – single sided) is used to record data on litter items that 
cannot be removed. This sheet needs to be used for all items. In general for floating litter 
surveys, this would include items such as ship ping containers that are too large to bring on-
board. Unlike for beach or benthic litter surveys where large items are likely to be fixed in 
position, it is unlikely that the same item will be encountered on a repeat survey because 
floating items are highly mobile.  
Data management platform 
Data collation should be undertaken through an online, relational database system17 under the control 
and direction of the local managers.  Responsibility for review and approval of uploaded data should be 
undertaken by the regional/country co ordinator who will clarify any issues with local managers. This 
would ensure a high level of consistency within each region as well as create a hierarchy of quality 
assurance on data acquisition. 
Equipment needs 
Equipment needs and operational logistics for traw l surveys are extensive and highly specialised (see 
e.g. NOWPAP 2007a and related references). For su rface trawls these are the general requirements: 
• Configuration of trawl equipment will be dependant on the type of floating litter and 
geographical conditions; typically nets may be 2-4 cm mesh size and up to 6 m wide; 
• Rope length has to be determined depending on the size of the trawl net and net spread, 
specialist advice on setting a trawl should be obtained; 
• Floating litter should be taken on board with proper equipment such as side rollers; 
• Litter can be sorted directly on board provided de ck space is available, care should be taken 
to ensure safety of personnel through use of protective clothing including gloves; 
• After collection and sorting, facilities are requir ed to safely count and weigh litter; specialist 
lifting and weighing equipment may be required. 
Floating litter visual surv ey operational guidelines 
Floating litter can be observed either from vessels or  aircraft (Ribic et al. 1992). Regardless of the 
platform being used, regional considerations, sampling units and litter characterization should be the same. However, unlike other surveys, floating litter ob servations do not necessarily need to occur as a 
stand alone activity and can be incorporated as a co mponent of other sea-going operations (using 
“Ships of Opportunity”) such as those related to fisheries, transport, defence or other research. While 
this may limit observations in some respects, there ar e also advantages in terms of costs relative to a 
dedicated survey as well as the opportunity to target  litter loads along major shipping lanes and fishery 
zones. 
                                                     
 
17 The detailed design of an appropriately configured RDBS is bey ond the scope of this project but it should be noted that the 
NMDMP, OSPAR and AMDS programmes all have databases t hat have been designed or developed and any of which should 
be suitable with a modest level of customization. The key thi ng would be to ensure that litter classification (see below) and 
beach characterization data structures were appropriately modified to address the flexib ility issues required of this system.  OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR FLOATING LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
53 Regional considerations 
A geographical hierarchy for sampling may be aligned with that used for beach surveys although the opportunity presented in the ad-hoc  use of ocean going vessels should not be ignored. 
Visual survey site selection and characterization 
Visual survey sites are best chosen in areas that: 
• Focus on areas that are known to generate or accumulate (convergence zones) marine litter 
such as major shipping lanes, or areas with  concentrated fisheries or similar commercial 
activities. 
• Will not impact on endangered or  protected species such as s ea turtles, sea/ shore birds or 
marine mammals; although given that visual surveys are generally low impact, relative to 
benthic or surface trawls, there is generally less scope for impacts. 
Within the above constraints on site selection, sampling units should be stratified relative to sources 
within a region such that there are samples obtained from: 
• Urban coasts (i.e. mostly terrestrial inputs); 
• Rural coasts (i.e. mostly oceanic inputs); 
• Within close distance to major riverine inputs; 
• Offshore areas (major currents, shippi ng lanes, fisheries areas, etc.). 
Sampling units 
The basic sampling unit for a visual  survey will comprise  a transect represen ted by an imaginary line 
over the surface of the ocean whic h is either travelled by a vessel  or aircraft. The line does not need to 
be straight although it is easier if it is. The observer will record all litter within a fixed distance on one or 
both sides of the line (see below). The width of the field of view should be recorded along with data 
about the distance travelle d and the litter observed. 
Visual Transects should be established by monito ring the time employed by observers rather than 
attempting to identify fixed length units. Ideally  location should be mapped using route plotters 
connected to on-board GPS systems that can record changes in vessel direction and therefore can be 
used to quantify the size and geographical locati on of the area surveyed. This approach assumes 
there will be differences in vessel speed and changes in direction that are beyond the control of the 
litter observers.  
Limiting observations to a fixed time period (typic ally two hours) will help avoid apathy and fatigue 
while at the same time allow large areas to be surveyed (even at slow speed).  
Transects of varying length are consistent wi th the methods employed by Shiomoto and Kameda 
(2005) in their floating litter survey around Japan. 
Litter should be measured as per the methods out lined in Ribic et al. (1992) and employed in 
Shiomoto and Kameda (2005) for strip transects, wherein all litter are recorded within a fixed distance 
of the direction of travel by the vessel (typically a distance of 50 or 100 m either or both sides of the 
vessel). The decision about whether to survey bot h sides of the vessel dep ends on sea-state, and the 
field of view of the observer which may differ between vessels.  
A minimum distance between transects of 1 km should prevent overlap. 
At least 20 sampling units should be randomly alloca ted within each region (note the stratification 
recommended above and that a level of redundancy in sampling units within each region is highly 
recommended). 
Sampling frequency 
The minimum sampling frequency for any site should be annually. Ideally it is recommended that 
locations be surveyed every three months (allowing an interpretation of results in terms of seasonal 
changes). Quarterly sampling is consistent with the recommendations for comprehensive beach litter 
assessments. Some consideration should be given to  tropical regions where there are essentially only OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR FLOATING LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
54 two seasons as well as high latitudes where acce ss is likely to be restricted due to extreme 
remoteness and/or through being iced-in. 
Ribic et al. (1992) do not specify a recommended survey frequency and the Shiomoto and Kameda 
(2005) survey was a one-time operation. 
Floating litter surveys may be more opportunistic in terms of sampling interval, although the 
development of engagements with shipping organiza tions may support more regular observations, 
particularly along major shipping routes. 
Litter categories and measurement  
Litter categorization is generally much more difficult  for remote observations. Observers are not able to 
“interact” with individual litter items so a simp lified list of items has been developed (Chapter II). 
Data sheets 
Two data sheets have been developed in line with the above: 
1. Site characterization data sheet (FL01 – single sided) is used to record information about 
the survey location. This sheet records inform ation about the proximity of the site to likely 
litter sources. The sheet should be filled out only once for each survey. 
2. Visual observation data sheet (FL03 – single sided) is used to  record survey specific data 
including categorization and measurement of li tter observed. This is the basic datasheet to 
be filled in for every transect at each site. If mu ltiple transects are run at any given site then 
a new sheet should be used for each shot. If multiple observers are recording data with 
different fields of view (e.g. one person obser ving to the starboard side and the other person 
observing to port) then each person should fill out a separate copy of this sheet. Data 
should be aggregated for analysis and reporting. 
Data management platform 
Data collation should be undertaken through an online, relational database system18 under the control 
and direction of the local managers.  Responsibility for review and approval of uploaded data should be 
undertaken by the regional/country co ordinator who will clarify any issues with local managers. This 
would ensure a high level of consistency within each region as well as create a hierarchy of quality 
assurance on data acquisition. 
Equipment needs 
Equipment needs for the remote observation of fl oating litter need not be onerous if regular access 
can be obtained to appropriate vessels travelling regu lar routes. GPS units that are used to record the 
survey path (transect) will need to have a tracking  function and binoculars will improve the capacity to 
identify litter items.

 OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR RAPID BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
61 Chapter V. Operational Guidelines for Rapid Beach Litter 
Assessment 
Objectives for rapid beach litter assessments 
Beach surveys have long been the primary tool for m easuring the load of marine litter in coastal and 
marine systems and they also provide an invaluabl e mechanism for education and building community 
understanding.  
Historically surveys of marine litter accumulation  on beaches have been the most commonly used 
method for estimating loads in the sea (e.g. Ribic et al.  1992, ANZECC 1996a, b, Rees and Pond 
1998, Kiessling 2003, Stuart 2003), however, there has been a marked lack of consistency in 
sampling protocols and litter characterization (classification).  
In this chapter guidelines are presented for r apid assessments of beach cast litter which have the 
following primary objectives. 
1. Quantification, characterizati on and identification of sources of marine litter for the purposes of 
developing and evaluating the effectiveness of  management, control, enforcement and/or 
mitigation strategies in particular integration with solid waste management. 
2. Understanding the level of threat pos ed by marine litter to biota and ecosystems. 
3. Providing comparable datasets for national and regional assessments of marine litter. 
4. Creation and strengthening of public awarene ss of marine litter issues through community 
engagement. 
In developing these objectives it needs to be rec ognized that such guidelines should be able to 
address a number of basic questions about marine  litter relating to the management, mitigation, 
sources and risks associated with litter in the envir onment (Table 5). In turn, such questions allow 
evaluation of the information colle cted from monitoring programmes and thereby assess its utility in 
supporting management responses. 
 
Table 5 . Key questions to be addressed through rapid assessment of beach litter. 
Monitoring Questions Monitoring Parameters 
Are management/mitigation strategies 
effective?  Litter Quantity (counts/weight) – changes 
through time. 
What are the sources and activities leading to production of marine litter? Litter categories (indicator items)  
Is there a threat to marine biota and 
ecosystems? Litter categories (indicator items) 
 
 
Rapid beach litter assessments provid e a tool that can be applied by a wide variety of groups including 
community organizations, schools, indigenous communities and commercial enterprises. The 
protocols have been designed as stand-alone as sessments and therefore they do not make 
prescriptions about how individual surveys should fit in relation to broader regional frameworks, the 
size and spatial configuration of sampling units, the sampling frequency or quality control procedures. 
Rapid assessments can contribute to a number of obj ectives in marine litter management including:  
• Quantification, characterization and identification of sources of marine litter for the purposes of 
developing and evaluating the effectiveness of  management, control, enforcement and/or 
mitigation strategies in particular integration with solid waste management. 
• Understanding the level of threat posed by marine litter to biota and ecosystems. 
• Providing comparable datasets for national assessments of marine litter. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR RAPID BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
62 • Creation and strengthening of public awareness of marine litter issues through community 
engagement. 
• Building capacity in marine litte r assessment that underpins t he transition to a comprehensive 
assessment framework. 
Beach litter rapid survey operational guidelines 
The rapid assessment guidelines have been developed from the comprehensive guidelines in Chapter 
III. Fewer prescriptions are made about sampling fram eworks and the concomit ant linkages to national 
or regional programmes. Similarly, the assessm ent is not intended for application where detailed 
information about litter fluxes is required. 
Rapid litter assessments should focus at the local scale although data may be aggregated or 
contributed into state, province or country scale assessments. The key element in developing rapid 
beach litter assessments is in selecting beaches which are accessible to survey teams. 
Beach selection and characterization 
When undertaking rapid beach litter assessments there is a need to identify and select suitable 
beaches to allow the establishment of appropriate sampling units. 
Beach selection criteria should include: 
• A minimum length of 100 m (i.e. sufficient to fit the smallest sampling unit) although beaches 
with small amounts of litter may need to be longer (e.g. 1 km); 
• Low to moderate slope (15 – 45º), which preclu des very shallow tidal mudflat areas that may 
be many kilometres wide at low tide; 
• Clear access to the sea (not bloc ked by breakwaters or jetties) such that marine litter is not 
screened by anthropogenic structures; 
• Accessible to survey team members all year round, although some consideration needs to be 
given to sites that are iced-in over winter and the difficulty in accessing very remote areas; 
• Survey activities should not be undertaken wher e there is risk of impact on any endangered or 
protected species such as sea turtles, sea bird s or shore birds, marine mammals or sensitive 
beach vegetation; in many cases this w ould exclude national parks but this may vary 
depending on local management arrangements. 
Each survey location will require a team leader who is able to liaise with relevant local area managers 
(e.g. local government representatives , park rangers, etc). The team leader will also be responsible for 
recruiting survey volunteers and organi sing field operations for each survey. 
At each location data need to be collected relating to  the nature of the beach environment including:  
Total beach length. 
Total beach width at low tide (provides an estimate of beach slope) Nearest river – name, distance, direction and whet her or not it inputs directly to the beach. 
Nearest town – name, distance and direction. 
• Main beach usage (i.e. recreational – swimming and sunbathing, fishing,  surfing, boat access 
or remote). 
• Access (vehicular, pedestrian and/or boat only). 
Tidal range should be obtained from published tidal data.  
The back of the beach should be described in terms of the dominant features , be it dunes, vegetation 
or built structures (rock walls , road, path, fence, etc).  
• Any other noteworthy information (e.g. an ot herwise remote and unvisited location may be 
subject to an annual surfing competition that results in a “pulse” of litter).  OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR RAPID BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
63 This information only needs to be collated once for each site and it may then be used for all future 
surveys. Much of this information can be obtained from maps and similar sources (e.g. Google Earth™ 
images), although such information should always be  checked by direct observation at the site.  
Additional information (see Comp rehensive Beach Litter Assessment s – Chapter III) may be collected 
particularly if the intention is to use the rapid assessment as a springboa rd for developing survey 
teams who may later participate within a comprehensive research programme. 
Sampling units 
Rapid litter assessments can be conducted over any length of beach although a minimum survey 
length of 100 m is recommended. Sampling may thus vary substantially between surveys in terms of 
the area considered and sampling effort applied. 
The length of beach surveyed and the width of the beach should be recorded such that litter quantities 
can be standardized to kilograms or co unts of items per unit length of beach. 
Sampling frequency 
The minimum sampling frequency for any one site should be at least annually. Ideally sampling should 
be conducted once every three months to obtai n a good comparison of seasonal changes. 
One off surveys may be undertaken, and the data will  be useful in developing training and awareness 
programmes. 
Laying out a typical survey 
Depending on the number of survey  team members, the survey proce ss can be undertaken in either of 
two ways (consistent with the NMDMP protocol; Shea vly 2007). Surveyors form skirmish lines either at 
right angles to the coast (2-5 persons) or parallel to the coast (>5 persons). In both cases there should 
be around 2 m between persons forming the line.  
All litter within the sampling unit larger than 2.5 cm in longest linear dimension should be collected. 
Upon completion of collection, the litter must be sorted and measured according to the categories in 
Appendix C.  
Assessment of small items, such as cigarette bu tts should be considered at the discretion of the 
survey organisers, although sampling within 10 m wide sub-units as per t he comprehensive survey 
may also be considered.  
Large immoveable objects (abandoned cars, very large nets, baulks of timber, etc) that cannot be 
moved by the team members should be recorded on an additional datasheet, with information 
collected on the nature and location (p referably GPS fixed) for each large item. This information will be 
submitted along with the other datasheets to ensure  that any large item is included only once in 
analysis. In addition, the item may be marked (preferably with paint), to indicate the item has been 
included (Wennecker pers. comm.). 
Data sheets 
Three data sheets have been developed for rapid beach litter assessments including: 
1. Site characterization data sheet (BR01 – double sided) is used to record information on the 
characteristics of the beach and pr oximity to local litter source s. This sheet only needs to be 
filled out once for each beach. 
2. Litter characterization data sheet (BR02 – double sided) is used to record survey specific data 
including categorization and measurement of litte r. This is the basic datasheet to be filled in 
for every survey at each site. 
3. Large items data sheet (ML01 – single sided) is used to record data on litter items that cannot 
be removed. This sheet needs to be used for all such items to ensure that they are only 
counted once (i.e. for the survey during which they are first encountered even if this is the 
initial clearance survey). Subsequent survey s should be based on a review of previously 
collected data and ideally a summary of this information should be taken into the field to 
ensure that these items are not recounted. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR RAPID BEACH LITTER ASSESSMENT 
 
64 Litter characterization 
Litter characterization should use the same approach as the comprehensive surveys.  
All collected litter should be disposed of appropriately. 
Data management platform 
Data may be contributed to regional coordinators wher e a team is working to develop capacity for the 
delivery of comprehensive beach surveys. Otherwise, t he data should be summarised by litter type 
and reported in terms of the amount of litter per unit length of beach.  
Equipment needs 
Safety is a priority and all field teams need to be equipped with a comprehensive first-aid kit. Field 
team members need appropriate clothing and foot wear, protective gloves, hats, sunscreen, wet 
weather gear, water and food. Major risks to personnel  include exposure to heat or cold, stick injuries 
(e.g. hypodermic syringes) and muscle/joint injuries associated with bending and lifting. Remote 
operations must follow appropriate safety protocol s to ensure personal safety for team members. 
Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are highly desirable,  particularly in relocating and determining the 
length of sampling units. The systems available ar e increasingly affordable and accurate. In the 
absence of a GPS a digital camera (e.g. mobile pho ne camera) can be used to provide photographs of 
key reference features on the beach to support relocation of sampling units.  
Where litter weights are recorded, battery powered electronic balances with an operating range of 0-
10 kg are now routinely available and ideal for weig hing smaller collections of items. Spring balances 
are available with a range of weight ratings up to 50 kg (and possibly higher). These balances can be 
used in conjunction with a standard 11 L bucket (or similar) to hold material during measurements. 
Spring balances have the advantage that they do not require electrical power and they are generally 
accurate enough (to within 10%) for the purposes of li tter characterization but they must be frequently 
replaced as the spring becomes rusted and worn.  
General equipment requirements include collecti on bags, clip-boards, tape measures, stakes and 
flagging tape all of which are routinely available from most hardware stores. 
A pocket calculator may be useful to sum weights that are collected in batches. 
A sharp knife or shears is useful for cutting away entangled litter (rope, cable fishing line and nets). 
Access to remote areas cannot be achieved without  appropriate (generally 4WD) vehicles. They have 
the added advantage that heavy items can often be lo aded into the tray (particularly if they come 
equipped with lifting gear) or alternatively dragged to a collection point.

77 Appendix B. Comparison of existing marine litter survey 
and monitoring protocols 
Thirteen different marine litter survey protocols we re considered (Table 7), with each survey reviewed 
against a set of 46 evaluation criteria (Table 9), which provided the basis for comparing the various survey protocols. The criteria empl oyed were abstracted from the literature and selected to target a set 
of best practice approaches for marine litter surv eys (see Ribic et al. 1992 for a seminal discussion on 
developing protocols). These criteria were criti qued by the UNEP/IOC Marine Litter Technical Working 
Group (TWG) and through a consideration of rele vant marine litter reviews (Rees and Pond 1995, 
ANZECC 1996a, Kiessling 2003, Stuart 2003, Sheavly 2007, Cheshire and Westphalen 2007). The 
criteria were mostly configured to enable simple yes/no questions and covered a range of issues that 
were broadly grouped firstly into a set of general questions that were relevant to all surveys regardless 
of type (beach, benthic or floating), including details of: 
• Sampling units and sampling frequency 
• Litter characterization 
• Logistics and facilitation

78 These questions were augmented with a series of ad ditional queries that were developed to elucidate 
characteristics specific to the diffe rent types of surveys and were ther efore particular to each of the 
beach, benthic and floating litter survey protocols (Table 9). 
The response to each question is detailed in Tabl e 9 with a summary of each issue provided in the 
following. 
General criteria relevant to all survey types – Survey framework 
1 Research, operational or community awareness programmes  
Survey design is largely predicated on the objective s and in particular whether the survey is conducted 
for research purposes, as part of an operational  management or cleanup programme or to improve 
community awareness of marine litter issues. 
Nine of the thirteen surveys considered had a signi ficant research focus (includes the AMDS, 
NOWPAP – Benthic, NOWPAP – Beach, KMMAF, ICC,  WWF, CCI and NDNH), of which over half 
(AMDS, NOWPAP – Benthic, KMMAF, WWF an d NDNHI) also encompassed some degree of 
community awareness as an objective. This focus on the general community recognizes the critical 
reliance on volunteer support for many beach surv eys. Only three of the beach survey protocols 
(NOWPAP – Beach, ICC and CC I) had no research element. 
Similarly, even those surveys that have little capa city to use volunteers (s uch as benthic, floating and 
clearance operations such as the NOWPAP – Bent hic and FAP) frequently maintain community 
awareness amongst their objectives. The latter may relate to a need to engage industry partners (e.g. 
fisheries and/or transport industries) who have a nee d to generate or maintain a positive public profile. 
2 Standing crop or flux rate  
There are two basic forms of beach litter assessment: 
• Standing crop, which is a “snapshot” of litter at a point in time, this generally entails litter 
observation but not necessarily litter removal. 
• Flux (or accumulation) rate of marine litter over  a specific period of time, this requires litter 
clearance. 
Nearly all beach surveys (10 out of 13) consider flux rates rather than standing crop. Exceptions 
include The Clean Coast Index (CCI) from Israel and  the annual ICC events both of which are targeted 
at standing crop observations and the Shiomoto  and Kameda (2005) survey from Japan which 
assessed floating litter and is also a standing crop assessment.  
3 Regionalization/sample representation  
Survey protocols varied substantially in terms of the extent to which they provide information about 
litter deposition at larger spatial scales. Only  three surveys, OSPAR, NMDMP and AMDS, consider 
sites within predefined regions that could be correla ted with major currents, coastal features and/or 
proximity to sources. The NOWPAP Beach and Be nthic surveys considered provinces within the 
member states, but the relationship between these anthropogenic boundaries and the physical environment is unclear. Many su rveys appear to consider each site as a stand alone unit with no 
capacity to aggregate or compare data at higher spatial scales. 
Floating litter surveys may be less constrained, operat ing over 100s – 1000s of kilometres, although 
floating litter clearance operations such as the F AP are limited to ports, harbours and embayments. 
There is a spatial hierarchy of sampling within the NMDMP which divides the US coast into nine 
regional areas based on oceanographic, meteorologica l and logistical criteria (Sheavly 2007). Similar 
designations have been used in t he OSPAR surveys (five regions;  OSPAR 2007) and have been 
recommended for litter sampling in Australia (fiv e to ten regions; ANZECC 1996a, Cheshire and 
Westphalen 2007).  
4 Sea conditions during survey  
Only the CCAMLR survey collects data on wave height  and frequency, while there are only four other 
surveys (AMDS, NMDMP, KMMAF and CCAMLR) that collect data on wind strength and direction. 
There is a divergence of opinion with respect to th e need for information on conditions at the time of 
the survey (e.g. Ribic et al. 1992, OSPAR 200 6, Cheshire and Westphalen 2007, Sheavly 2007). APPENDIX B 
 
79 Surprisingly, surveys that rely on vessels (N OWPAP-Benthic, FAP, Japan Floating Debris and the 
NDNHI) do not collect data on sea conditions (although the Japanese survey did collect data on 
visibility).  
It therefore seems arguable that t here is a need for substantial data on conditions at the time of 
survey, particularly with respect to  beach surveys, although factors that  affect the collectors (extreme 
heat, cold, snow and/or rain, etc) should be noted. 
5 Specialized equipment  
For a beach survey, basic equipment might be consider ed to comprise the datasheets, collection bags 
and tape measures. While five of the beach surveys can be undertaken without the need for more sophisticated equipment (KMMAF, ICC, CCAMLR, WWF and CCI), most protocols require access to a 
GPS, and others require weighing scales and, in some instances (WWF in northern Australia), 4WD 
vehicles and/or heavy lifting equipment. 
Specialised equipment needs are substantial for bent hic/floating litter surveys (e.g. boats/ships or 
aerial platforms, diving equipment, dredging equipment, etc).  
Ideally, all litter survey protocol s should employ sampling units that are GPS referenced. For vessel-
based operations this should present little difficu lty, although portable GPS units that would be used 
for beach surveys are increasingly accurate and affordable
19 (Cheshire and Westphalen 2007). 
General criteria relevant to all survey types – Sampling units and 
sampling frequency 
6 Sampling units and replication  
In marine litter surveys a sampling unit can be defined  as a length or area of beach, ocean or seabed. 
Data about litter loads (types and amounts) are co llected from the sampling unit and these data are 
then used to provide a basis for reporting or comp arison (quantitative or statistical analysis).  
Beach litter surveys 
Most beach litter operations (excluding the NOWPAP – Beach and the ICC) involve the identification 
of discrete sampling units that va ry from 10-1500 m in length. The use of a known length sampling unit 
allows litter load to be reported (in terms of either weight or count) per unit length of beach (e.g. kg / 
km of beach as per the AMDS surveys or num ber of items per 500 m sampling unit as per the 
NMDMP, Sheavly 2007). 
Typically beach surveys vary widely  in the length of beach surveyed; this relates both to the area to be 
covered (related to the width of the beach) but more  often relates to the quantity of litter that may 
accumulate on the beach. Some beaches acquire relati vely little litter in which case a larger length or 
area is required in order to generate a sufficient sample. Other locations may accumulate large amounts of litter such that the sheer volume ma kes removal and characterization logistically 
prohibitive except for relatively  short lengths of the beach.  
A simple approach to estimating the appropriate length of beach to survey is to examine the 
relationship between the numbers of new types of li tter observed for progressively larger sections of 
beach. This approach is based on the commonly used species x area curves used by ecologists to 
determine the size of a sampling unit required for vegetation analysis.  
The method requires the researcher to successively sa mple areas of beach starting with (for example) 
a 10 m length of beach and then increasing the leng th of the survey transect in 10 m increments. 
Typically, in the first section samp led all types of litter are new and so the survey team will record a 
large number of new items. As the survey is ext ended it will become less and less likely that the 
survey team will find new classes of litter (i.e. types of litter that have not been recorded in previous 
sections that have been surveyed). Data from this so rt of survey can be recorded as shown in Table 8 
and graphed as illustrated in Figure 11. 
Using these data as an example it can be seen that  in the first 10 m section of beach, 25 individual 
pieces of litter were collected comprising 10 different  types of litter. In the next 10 m section a further 
26 litter items were found but this was less diverse comprising only 5 different types (of which four 
                                                     
 
19 For example, many modern mobile phones now incorporate GPS technology particularly in the hi gh-end brands but it is likely 
that this trend will extend to standard models over the next few years. APPENDIX B 
 
80 were new types and 1 type had already been recorded from the previous sectio n). After surveying the 
third section a total of 30 m of beach had been surveyed; 32 litter items were collected again 
comprising 5 different types of litter but in this case only 1 type was new the remaining four having 
already been recorded from one of the preceding sections. This process is continued and it can be seen that by the time 80 m of beach has been surveyed then very few new items are being recorded 
for each section. In this case it would be reasona ble to restrict the litter assessment to a 100 m section 
of beach.

 APPENDIX B 
 
81 Where the amount of litter is relatively sparse, a larger sampling unit (i.e. 500 – 1,000 m or more) 
should be employed. The principal factor determining tr ansect length for beach surveys is the signal to 
noise ratio. A sufficient length of beach is required  to obtain enough data about litter items to provide a 
reliable estimate of loads. If sampling units are too short then the estimate is likely to be inaccurate, if they are too long then the sampling programme becomes intractable. 
 
 
Figure 11.  Litter type versus length of beach curves 
 
Replication of sampling units varies substantially. For beach surveys it is typical to have between one 
and several samples per beach. The decision of whether  or not to replicate sampling units at the level 
of the beach (i.e. whether to have one sampling unit or many) is largely determined by the desire to 
obtain spatially averaged samples. From a statisti cal stand-point multiple sampling units per beach 
may not be true replicates.  
The NMDMP beach survey uses only one sampling unit  per beach (i.e. beaches are considered to be 
replicates for a broader region). 
Benthic litter surveys 
The NOWPAP benthic survey considered areas of di fferent sizes depending on whether the survey is 
a diver survey (10 m × 10 m) or trawl survey (1000 m × 1000 m). Conversely, the Hawaiian survey 
protocol employs manta tows that may vary substant ially in length and therefore area covered, thereby 
focussing on the need to cover large areas.  
The challenge for benthic surveys is to encomp ass the different needs for surveys in shallow 
nearshore areas against t hose in deeper water. The 10 m × 10  m units employed in the NOWPAP 
Benthic survey may be too small to be representative (particularly given the 1-3 sampling units 
recommended for each monitoring site20). Conversely, the manta tows used in Hawaii cover more area 
but are observers are likely to be moving too fast to obtain data any meaningful data on small litter 
items. 
Floating litter surveys 
There are no indications of sampling unit size in either of the floating survey protocols (FAP and 
Japan), although density calculation results for ea ch observer period are presented for the Japanese 
operation (Shiomoto and Kameda 2005). Given the pau city of established models for floating litter 
surveys, our recommended approach follows that of Shiomoto and Ka meda (2005). This is augmented 
with information from Ribic et al. (1992) wherein su rvey transects may vary in length and litter density 
is calculated based on estimating the number of litter items observed within a fixed horizontal distance 
from the vessel across the length of each survey line. 
In a summary of eighteen floating litter trawl survey s, Ribic et al. (1992) found trawl distances ranging 
from 0.33 – 3 nautical miles and that mesh si zes were small (0.27 mm – 14 mm) and therefore 
                                                      
20 NOWPAP do not provide a detailed specification of what a “monitor ing site” comprises. On this basis it is problematical to 
evaluate the suitability of the proposed sampling strategy. APPENDIX B 
 
82 targeted small items. Cons ideration should be give n to transfer of the NO WPAP Benthic approach to a 
floating litter survey with reference to the guidelines recommended by Ribic et al. (1992). 
Although not included in the survey comparison, t he “Fishing for Litter” initiative undertaken by 
OSPAR is worthy of note (OSPAR 2006).  
7 Frequency  
Across all survey types, sampling frequencies rang ed from 0.5 – 12 months, although half the surveys 
undertook sampling on an annual basis (NOWPAP – Benthic, NOWPAP – Beach, ICC, WWF, FAP 
and the NDNHI). To some degree sampling may be constr ained to a particular period, particularly at 
higher latitudes where the sea might be iced in ov er winter. Otherwise it might be argued that annual 
surveys lack the power to resolve marine litter questions at the level required for 
management/verification. Sheavly  (2007) suggested that future beach litter sampling should 
investigate seasonal factors but al so that sampling could occur less frequently in tropical areas. 
Quarterly surveys have been recommended for Austra lia (ANZECC 1996a; Cheshire and Westphalen 
2007). 
Pragmatically the organization required to suppor t monthly surveys is unlikely to be universally 
available and on this basis quarterly surveys ar e the recommended sampling frequency for all survey 
types, although there are site specific issues that may require a longer interval (i.e. presence of ice) or 
result in a shorter sampling interval (regular main tenance clearances). As a minimum, each site should 
be sampled annually. 
8 Sampling in line with specific events  
Few survey protocols attempt to align sampling with specific natural events although in Korea, there is 
a litter capture programme (without formal data co llection) that deploys fences across some river 
mouths prior to the onset of winter rains (Cho 2005).  
While responses to specific events may be useful , the NMDMP stipulated a need for monthly litter 
samples to be collected within a short period of ea ch other in order to suppo rt data analysis (Sheavly 
2007). This requirement largely negates any oppor tunity to link sampling to specific events. 
9 Ad-hoc reporting  
With the exception of the AMDS protocol, other surveys do not provide a mechanism for ad-hoc  
reporting of litter items. In particular, floating litter (e.g. lost shipping containers or fishing nets) that 
may comprise a shipping hazard are frequently repor ted to local maritime authorities but currently 
there is no formal mechanism to capture these data.  Other large scale litter events that come to the 
attention of the media might also be recorded.  
Consideration could be given to developing an online system for ad-hoc  reporting of litter items. Such 
a system may use a data recording sheet si milar to that provided in the AMDS. 
General criteria relevant to all su rvey types – Litter characterization 
10 Size limits  
Many litter surveys consider all litter items larger than  2.5 cm × 2.5 cm as this  is the minimum disposal 
size permitted under MARPOL for ground shipping waste (Ribic et al. 1992). While the NMDMP 
includes this criterion, larger size limits are designated for some items (i.e. rope must be >1 m long to be included; Sheavly 2007). Conversely, OSPAR makes no dist inction based on size, arguing that 
even small items (e.g. cotton buds or matches) prov ide useful information about littering that may be 
used to change behaviours and thereby better manage litter problems (it is worth noting that in some countries smoking has been banned from many suburban beaches).  
Small, very common, litter items such as cigarette butts may present a logistic problem in terms of 
collection over the entire area of large (at least 100 m long) sampling unit, although smaller sub-units 
might be considered (i.e. 10 m wide strips of beach).  
11 Litter categorization  
The number of categories varies substantially acro ss surveys, although there are arguably three quite 
distinct groups; Low resolution survey s that distinguish (1-6 categories) as seen in the two operational 
and floating litter surveys (CCI, FAP and Japan Float ing); Medium resolution (30-60 categories) which 
includes most other surveys (NMDMP, NOWPAP – Benthic, KMMA F, CCAMLR and WWF) and High APPENDIX B 
 
83 resolution (90+ categories) which includes th ree surveys the AMDS, OSPAR and NOWPAP – Beach 
survey protocols (the latter us ing the NPEC data sheets).  
The Hawaiian benthic survey (NDNHI) uses 250 categorie s, but these relate to the diversity of derelict 
fishing nets that were the specific target of that  survey. Similarly, the Net Kit employed in Northern 
Australia as part of the WWF survey protocol (now operated by NRETA) contains more than 180 
different net types that may be identified wi thin litter collections (White et al. 2004). 
In most cases classification of litter is based on a hi erarchy that identifies items firstly by what they are 
made from (e.g. plastic vs. glass vs. rubber, etc) t hen by their form (e.g. bottles vs. sheets vs. fishing 
nets, etc) and sometimes also by size (e.g. long le ngths of rope vs. short lengths). However, Sheavly 
(pers. comm.) has encouraged a different approach to litter classification wherein litter is grouped 
according to sources (i.e. a focus on managing littering behaviour rather than litter types)21. 
From a research perspective, the larger the number of  categories that are considered the greater the 
capacity to summarise, analyse and interpret the data. In turn, this influences the range and 
complexity of questions that can be posed. Similarl y, it might be argued that the use of only a few 
relatively broad categories makes targeting management to specific issues/industries/sources more difficult. However, the number of categories needs to be balanced against pragmatic/operational 
needs (e.g. experience and training of the survey team ). There are therefore solid arguments for using 
a smaller number of categories as this simplifies tr aining of the volunteers r equired to support surveys 
and time required in sorting time required at the end of each collection.  
12 Litter summaries  
Most surveys (10 of 13 – not FAP, CCI and Japan fl oating) aim to summarise data to report on litter 
composition. Form, size and indicator groups are sporadically employed (5, 4 and 5 surveys 
respectively) but the capacity to develop summaries is  intimately related to the system by which litter 
items are classified (see 11 above).  
A litter classification system for the operational guide lines outlined in this report was developed based 
on the alignment (wherever possible) of the litter categorization tabl es from eight different survey 
protocols (see Appendix C). The resulting matrix comprised more than 220 litter types and this was 
then refined to amalgamate similar categories, spread across up 10 broader classes primarily based 
on material composition of the litter, including: 
• Cloth 
• Glass, ceramics and pottery 
• Foam (including sponge and packaging/insulation foam) 
• Hard plastics (anything that has been moulded) 
• Soft plastics 
• Metals 
• Rubber 
• Paper and cardboard 
• Wood 
• Other (this group is not necessarily based on composition) 
These broader classes each comprise from 5-14 s pecific types such that the 220 different groups 
identified across the various surveys is aligned with one of 77 litter types (see Appendix C for a 
summary) which form the basis for litter characterization in the recommended sampling guidelines for 
beach surveys. However, note that a further subset of these litter ty pes was created (35 categories) to 
be used in surveys where the litter were remotely observed (and ther efore the composition cannot be 
determined – see Appendix C). 
                                                      
21 A properly configured relational database would provide lookup tables  that could be used to re-aggregate litter types to 
support different analyses. Using this approac h tools could be developed to aggregate dat a on the basis of sources, risks to 
wildlife, form, etc. depending on the purpose of the analysis being undertaken.  APPENDIX B 
 
84 13 Quantifying litter  
Irrespective of how litter is classified, there is a need to develop some system for quantification in 
order to provide a basis for comparison either between beaches/regions or within regions through 
time. Four approaches to quantification present as being practical for use in routine surveys although 
not all can approaches can be used for all types of litter. These four approaches comprise: 
• Presence/absence of items within each litter type; 
• Counts of items in each litter type; 
• Weights of items within each litter type; 
• Volumes of items within each litter type. 
Most survey protocols recommen d one or other of these with “counts” being the predominant 
approach. Irrespective of current usage, there are strengths and weaknesses associated with all of 
these approaches to measurement re lative to different litter types. 
Presence / absence 
For some purposes it may be possible to simply reco rd the presence of different  classes of litter. In 
most cases this would not provide sufficient resolution to provide a meaningful interpretation and 
would not be recommended. 
Counts of items within categories 
Counts are relatively easy to make and they do not  require any specialised equipment. In relation to 
litter items such as plastic drink bottles or plas tic bags counts are arguably a very good indicator of 
importance. For remotely observed litter, count s within types are the only available approach. 
Problems arise however when there are litter items within the same class that may differ substantially 
in terms of size. Counts of derelict fishing nets will grossly underestimate the significance of larger 
nets (Kiessling 2003) which may vary in size from less than 1 m2 to 100s or even 1000s of m2. In such 
cases counts are much less useful than a measurement of weight. Similarly counts are less useful for 
heavily fragmented litter items. How, for example, do you count a hundred pieces of plastic bottle – is 
it equivalent to one bottle or many? In such cases alternative measurements may be more 
appropriate. 
Weights of categories 
Superficially, measurements of weight may appear to provide an alternative to counts but similar 
problems apply. A simple statement that there is 100 kg of polyethylene sheet in a litter collection 
provides data on how much material there is but it is very difficult to relate this to management or the 
assessment of downstream risks unless you know what  that 100 kg comprises in terms of individual 
items. If for example the 100 kg comprises 10,000 pl astic bags each of which has the capacity to be 
ingested and kill wildlife then this represents a differ ent scale of problem than if the litter comprises a 
single roll of material.  
Similarly not all types of litter can be weighed, h eavily fouled fishing nets or baulks of timber may 
weigh many tonnes. Practically these cannot be weighed unless the survey team has access to 
specialist equipment (that would not be routinely available). Furt hermore, weights will vary (often 
substantially) depending on whether the material is wet or dry (particularly for cloth or ropes and 
netting). 
Volume of categories 
For some litter items (e.g. baulks of processed timb er) estimates of volume are probably easier than 
any other approach. The dimensions of such items can be measured or estimated and this can then be quickly converted to volume. Similarly for tangled ma sses of discarded fishing net (which cannot be 
weighed), estimates of volume may be the best approach to quantification. 
Is it necessary to use only one system for measurement? 
The most obvious conclusion from the above is that  different systems of measurement could be used 
for different classes of litter. While this approach to measurement is more work for surveyors in the 
field, the benefits from a litter management perspe ctive may be substantial, particularly if litter 
characterization is subject to a regular process of re view such that survey effort refines the focus to 
those litter items of particular management concern. APPENDIX B 
 
85 For comprehensive research surveys, where the survey is carried out by  a trained team, this is not an 
unreasonable proposition but for most surveys there is no certainty that peopl e involved will be able to 
quickly adapt from one form of measurement to another.  
An alternative approach adopted in some surveys (notably the WWF in northern Australia and the 
AMDS) is to make multiple measurements (e.g. weights and counts) and to use these measurements 
to calculate other fact ors such as volume.  
Counts of items within categories occur in virtua lly all litter surveys (not the FAP which does not 
investigate the collected litter). Litter weight wa s considered in five surveys (AMDS, NOWPAP – 
Benthic, CCAMLR, WWF and FAP), the ICC survey also  recorded total weights of litter, while three 
surveys (OSPAR, CCAMLR and NDNHI)  considered counts wi thin size classes (a  hybrid of counts 
and volumes).  
For trawl surveys catch per unit area would be the most robust approach to quantification (Ribic et al. 
1992), but this parameter does not appear to have been employed in the only current trawl survey 
protocol (NOWPAP – Benthic).  
Recognition that neither counts nor weights alone are necessarily sufficient has also resulted in 
changes to classification of litter. Data on the si ze frequency distribution of derelict fishing nets may be 
obtained across a number of bins (e.g. counts of nets with sizes in the range such as < 5 m2, < 20 m2, 
< 100 m2, ≥ 100 m2). Such data may be much more amenable to interpretation and provide a more 
coherent basis for management interventions as large numbers of small nets may suggest they are 
being fragmented by a highly energetic local environm ent or that they have be en in the system for a 
longer period of time and may have come a substantia l distance from their source. Conversely larger, 
and probably more environmentally damaging nets, are more likely to have a local source which may lead to a more direct management intervention.  
14 Litter sources  
The term “litter source” has been used variously in the literature to mean either the user-groups  that 
are littering or alternatively  the point of manufacture or origin  of a litter item.  
“Litter Source” in the ICC and NMDMP surveys was de termined by categories of user-groups (boaters, 
fishers, beach goers, etc.). Ident ifying such sources of land-based and ocean-based provides a useful 
and functional approach to assessing how an item becomes marine litter and its associated source. 
Indicator items are used in both the ICC and NMDMP to  relate litter to user-groups. Identifying sources 
in this manner leads to the development of practi cal management tools to target the behaviours of 
groups that are littering and change this behaviour accordingly.  
The classification of litter based on the point of manuf acture or country of origin is arguably of less 
value. It has been suggested that within a global  marketplace, tagging it ems with a country of 
production is not likely to provide a practical or functional approach to management of litter. This 
argument is reflected in the decision by OSPAR to abandon source identificatio n owing to the time and 
resources required.  
Conversely, the AMDS provides for the collection of information on the point of manufacture or origin 
of litter items based on barcodes, address label s and other identifiers (Cheshire and Westphalen 
2007). The AMDS also makes provision for the use of the net-kit identifiers  developed under the WWF 
protocols and used to classify fishing nets and thereb y to identify sources (industry sector that uses 
that particular type of net). In countries like Au stralia, where relationships with industry are well 
established, it is possible to differentiate litter it ems used by domestic operat ors from those that have 
come from foreign operators. This is particularl y true of discarded or derelict fishing nets which 
comprise a major environmental hazard particularly, for example, in northern Australia.  
From a logistics and data management perspective, the value in identifying sources is likely to vary 
from region to region. In areas such as Australia where a substantial component of the litter is not of 
local origin, country of origin identification pr ovides the basis for international discussion and 
negotiation. In areas such as Europe, where much of t he litter is of local origin and source information 
(country of origin) is of little practical use wh en compared to other approaches such as understanding 
discard behaviours. Furthermore, given the increasi ng globalization of trade, speed of transport and 
increasing diversity in ethnicity within population centres worldwide (and consequently the variability, 
particularly amongst food related litter), source inform ation of this kind is likely to become less valuable 
over time.  APPENDIX B 
 
86 Conversely for litter items that are widely accepted as being both seriously widespread and 
ecologically damaging, such as fishing nets, identific ation of the source (in this case the fishery) 
responsible may be a key element to the developm ent of management strategies. Consequently, the 
investigations into net types and origins as ex plored in northern Australia and Hawaii may be worth 
further consideration and expansion (see White et al. 2004, Timmers et al. 2005). 
At the other end of the scale, pl astic shopping bags are widely seen as ubiquitous and environmentally 
damaging but there is no mechanism for identificati on of sources. It is likely that alternative 
approaches to management are needed (e.g. to focus on legislative arrangement s such as the recent 
proposal to ban plastic shopping bags throughout the whole of Australia by the end of 2008, see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P lastic_shopping_bag#_note-6 ,  Accessed February 2008). 
15 Identification tools  
Three surveys have guides to assist litter classifi cation (note this should not be confused with field 
guides that assist in conducti ng a survey – see below). As di scussed above the WWF surveys in 
northern Australia developed “the Net Kit” an identific ation guide for derelict fishing nets (White et al. 
2004), to be used in conjunction with beach litter su rveys. This guide helps quantify the profusion of 
nets into manageable categories and may ultimately as sist in targeting mana gement at the sources. 
This guide models similar approaches used for fishing nets clearances in the northwest Hawaiian 
Islands (Timmers et al. 2005). 
OSPAR used an online Marine Litter Gu ide; www.marine-litte r.net/guide/guide.htm  but this is no 
longer operational (as of July 2008).  
On a less formal front, datasheets often include im ages of each litter item (see the WWF protocol – 
White 2005). 
16 Entrapped fauna  
Many surveys (7 in total; AMDS, NMDMP, NOWPAP – Beach, KMMAF, ICC, WWF and NDNHI) 
require data on any entrapped fauna to be included as pa rt of the survey although there is often a lack 
of clarity as to what animal groups are to be included.  In northern Australia, the focus is largely on 
marine reptiles (White 2005), although other or ganism may be included. Otherwise, although the 
threat posed to wildlife is readily acknowledged, most  reporting would appear to relate more to marine 
mammals, reptiles, birds and possibly sharks and rays (see Timmers et al. 2005) rather than bony fish 
and large mobile invertebrates (large crustaceans,  molluscs, etc), although the physical damage to 
corals has been noted in Hawaii (Donohue et al. 2001).  
Entanglements need to be identified and should be incl uded as part of the “Addi tional notes” section of 
a survey, with the associated guidebook outlining re porting requirements with respect to animal type, 
tangle type and status (alive or dead).  
17 Large litter items  
Five surveys (AMDS, NOWPAP – Beach, ICC, OSPA R and WWF) make allowanc es for large items of 
litters (e.g. car bodies, very large fishing nets, baulks of timber etc). Large items, floating, sunken or 
beached are unlikely to be removed even assuming equipment and funds are available. In those 
surveys that address this issue it  is generally recommended that the character and position (preferably 
GPS fixed) of large objects should be noted in as mu ch detail as possible, such that the item can be 
mapped and excluded from future surveys (and also be reported as a potential hazard in the case of 
floating litter).  
The key issue from a litter sampling perspective is that such items are included only once, when they 
are first observed.  
Municipal agencies might be engaged to remove these items at a later date.  
18 Large natural litter items  
Only one survey (Japan floating debris survey) made allowance for trees and foliage that were 
encountered. Otherwise, naturally occurring woody litter is rarely reported as part of the litter data. 
Given that the source of natural woody litter is un likely to be established, and that the process by 
which it arrived may be natural, there would seem to be little need to gather such data. APPENDIX B 
 
87 19 Sampling effort  
Almost all surveys (excluding t he NOWPAP – Benthic or FAP surv eys) recorded the number of 
persons engaged in litter collection and many also collected data on the time taken to complete each sampling unit. 
For the NMDMP, the time taken to complete the survey  is recorded but the number of people involved 
is not (Sheavly 2007). However, this protocol used two different methods for completing a 500 m 
sampling unit depending on the number of persons involved. Survey team members form skirmish 
lines either at right angles to the coast (2-5 pers ons) or parallel to the coast (>5 persons), which 
presumably helped to keep the effort roughly the same. 
General criteria relevant to all survey types – Logistics and 
capability 
20 Field staff  
Most surveys (AMDS, NMDMP,  NOWPAP – Beach, OSPAR, CCAM LR, OSPAR, CCI and NDNHI) try 
to use the same personnel in subsequent surveys (note the Japan Floating Litter survey was a one-
off). Sheavly (2007) noted however , that the staggered initiation of the NMDMP meant that some 
locations were surveyed for more than ten years,  making the maintenance of volunteer enthusiasm 
and continuity quite difficult, with a concomitant need to find and train replacement field teams.  
In this respect the NMDMP probably offers the best  example of a large scal e litter survey that was 
reliant on voluntary input. In a summary report, S heavly (2007) concluded that volunteers were 
effective, but that efficiencies could be greatly enhanced through in tegration of the sampling within 
local resource management programs, which would include support from national parks, resource 
managers, fisheries and tourism managers as well as non-government organizations. 
It needs to be recognized that volunteers typically co me from a wide variety of backgrounds; by way of 
example the NMDMP volunteers included retired cor porate executives, technicians, educators, local 
conservation organizers, middle and high school sci ence classes, college students, U.S. Naval and 
Coast Guard offices and other members from the private sector (Sheavly 2007). 
This diversity will bring with it differences in  knowledge and experience and these need to be 
addressed when developing a voluntee r programme. In summary there are a number of key issues 
that need to be considered when engaging volunteers in marine litter assessments and these include (adapted from Sheavly 2007): 
a. Volunteers need to be properly trained with hands-on training exercises and supportive 
training materials and programme manuals that detail responsibilities and procedures. 
b. Local coordination and management is needed to  ensure that volunteers are available 
when needed and monitoring schedules are followed. 
c. Effective and frequent communication is a key element in keeping volunteers engaged 
and up-to-date with the programme activities, in cluding how their monitoring activities are 
supporting resource and conservation management efforts. 
d. Succession plans are needed to ensure that  as some volunteers retire or leave the 
programme, new volunteers are trained to provide replacements. 
e. Regular recognition efforts (media coverage, presentations by monitoring group members 
and/or management groups at local civic meet ings, thank you notes, various memorabilia 
including t-shirts, hats, etc.) of the vol unteers and their efforts can be effective in 
maintaining their involvement in the monitoring programme. 
f. The monitoring programme needs to be realistic as to expectations of labour and the 
length of time needed to conduct this type of study.  
g. Programme managers need to make regular visits to sites to ensure that training is 
relevant and appropriate to the needs of the survey. Ideally follow-up visits should be 
scheduled to coincide with re-training efforts and other activities.  
h. Volunteer managers, who may often be vol unteers themselves, need appropriate training 
to ensure that they have the skills to manage a volunteer workforce. 
i. 
 Ideally local partnerships may be developed with state or municipal agency staff to 
facilitate the monitoring and integratio n of volunteer management, training and 
programme delivery.  APPENDIX B 
 
88 j. Where appropriate, typically for remote su rveys or where local people are limited by 
financial or other resources, monetary support may be required to cover transportation 
expenses related to their efforts.  
k. While the very nature of a volunteer is not to  expect anything in return for his/her efforts, 
people do like to know that their efforts are meaningful and appreciated.  
 
In more general terms the following issues are also relevant when managing volunteer programmes 
(adapted from the “Model Code of Practice for Org anisations Involving Volunteer Staff”; Volunteering 
Australia 2007): 
a. Interview and employ volunteer staff in accordance with anti discrimination and equal 
opportunity legislation; 
b. Provide volunteer staff with orientation and training; c. Provide volunteer staff with a healthy and safe workplace; 
d. Provide appropriate a nd adequate insuranc e coverage for volunteer staff; 
e. Define volunteer roles and develop clear job descriptions; f. Differentiate between paid and unpaid roles; 
g. Provide appropriate levels of suppo rt and management for volunteer staff; 
h. Provide volunteers with a copy of policies pertaining to volunteer staff; 
i. Provide all staff with information on grievance and disciplinary policies and procedures; 
j. Acknowledge the rights of volunteer staff; 
k. Offer volunteer staff the opportunity for professional development; l. reimburse volunteer staff for out of pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the 
organization; 
m. Treat volunteer staff as valuable team memb ers, and advise them of the opportunities to 
participate in agency decisions; and 
n. Acknowledge the contributions of volunteer staff. 
 
21 Staff training  
Only the NMDMP protocol specifies a field trai ning regime for its volunteers, which required a 
substantial effort on the part of the lead agency (Ocean Conservancy) in terms of identifying and 
recruiting volunteers and then training them in situ  (Sheavly 2007). 
While CCAMLR indicate that staff undertaking the survey are “appropriately trained”, there are no 
details as to what this comprises, but it may well refe r to safety issues (given that the survey occurs in 
remote Antarctic locations) rather than to the litter survey protocol. 
Consistent, high quality training at the management and field level is essential to quality assurance 
and control over the data. Education of staff should in clude information on the results of surveys such 
that staff can understand the context of the field programme. 
22 Manuals and training tools  
All large scale marine litter surveys have manual s and/or field guides to assist volunteers, most 
notable are those developed for the ICC and NMDMP (The Ocean Conservancy 2002, US 
Environment Protection Agency 2002, Sheavly 2007).  
Field guides and litter identification tools are an im portant element in the maintenance of sampling 
consistency. Importantly, care should be taken to ens ure that the development of  guides is sensitive to 
language and cultural issues. For example, guides fo r surveys involving indigenous Australians should 
not contain images or names of deceased persons. I ssues of this nature highlight the need to obtain 
the support of locally based managers as the poi nt of liaison between volunteers and higher level 
survey management. 
23 Quality assurance / quality control of the data  
Few marine litter surveys (only 2 of the surveys considered) have mechanisms for assuring data quality, which is of concern given the high le vel of voluntary help that is engaged (Ribic et al.  1992). 
The OSPAR survey has a quality assurance prog ramme based around a “C hecklist” approach to 
surveys assisted by multilingual, illustrated online support (OSPAR 2007). The NMDMP has a built in 
quality assurance protocol conduct ed by survey managers (who take re sponsibility for each site) such 
that a proportion of all location/month combinat ions are checked, and data errors identified (US 
Environmental Protection Agency 2002, Sheavly 2007).  APPENDIX B 
 
89 Development of a quality assurance programme with in a large scale litter survey is essential, 
particularly given that language and cultural differences will present challenges for data integration 
and exchange.  
24 Logistic and technical support  
Eleven of the survey protocols inco rporated engagements with external partners. The exceptions were 
either contained within the respective organizati on (CCAMLR, which operates in a very remote 
locations) or comprised a one-off survey (Japan floa ting litter). Most litter surveys, particularly beach 
clearances, engage with a range of stakeholders that may include individuals, community groups, 
industries and government organizations (Cheshire a nd Westphalen 2007). In most instances, the on 
ground component of a survey is relatively straig ht forward in terms of being completed by non-
technical persons. However, responsibility for dat a collation, quality control, analysis and development 
of reports and provision of expert techni cal advice is often more problematic.  
External support in terms of data collation, mana gement, analysis, interpretation and reporting is 
essential for a large scale litter programme. These services may be offered by a dedicated marine 
litter framework such as that offered by the ICC or  include engagements with universities, government 
science agencies and/or international organizations (such as UNEP). 
25 Centralised data storage  
In line with the above, all surveys except the AMDS and NDNHI  (although note t hat these surveys 
were excluded as they don’t explicitly state this ) maintain a centralised data collation, management, 
quality assurance and storage platform. Capacity fo r online access to the data by stakeholders was 
not explored, although the ability to see the resu lts of surveys may be an important element in 
maintaining volunteer enthusiasm. 
A centralised database should have capacity to interf ace with data from existing marine litter survey 
programmes. While the systems used to characterise  litter vary between surveys, these differences 
can be circumvented through a tr anslation table (see Appendix  C). Although the design of a 
centralised database is beyond the scope of the curr ent reporting, the basic st ructures can be readily 
identified, including: 
Organizations – who is engaged in surveys? 
Locations – where surveys are unde rtaken, include specific details of  the site that are independent 
of litter surveys. 
Surveys – when surveys were undertaken, including dat a relative to the specific survey (number of 
persons involved, etc). 
Survey data – what the surveys found in terms of marine litter. 
Information/translation tables – such as relati ng litter types to those employed other surveys. 
26 Online support, data entry st rategy and reporting interface  
Five of the surveys maintained an online presence th at can assist in advertising awareness of marine 
litter issues (NOWPAP- Benthic, NOWPAP – Beach,  NMDMP, ICC and OSPAR), report results of 
surveys and serve to advertise future activities. Online support often includes guides for field 
operations including detailed survey protocols as well as the capacity to both upload and review data 
in some instances.  
Notably, Ocean Conservancy has a substantia l online presence for their ICC Program 
(http://www.oceanconser vancy.org/site/PageSer ver?pagename=press_icc ), which includes summary 
reports for each country. The NMDMP has an extensive online presence (http://www.oceancons ervancy.org/nmdmp
) with data listings and summaries covering the life of the 
study (Sheavly 2007). 
27 Data collection during or post beach collection  
Many surveys (9 of those considered – not OSPAR, CCAMLR, Japan floating, FAP and the CCI) 
collect litter from across a sampling unit and then co llate and characterise the gathered litter (either 
using weights or counts or both). Alternatively dat a can be recorded without collecting items (counts 
only) or while the litter is being collected. In some  cases this is faster but it depends on whether the 
material is heavily fragmented and whether or not su pport vehicles or similar are available to carry 
litter back to a sorting location. APPENDIX B 
 
90 Data on entanglements and large immovable items is generally best collected as they are 
encountered. 
28 Datasheets  
The AMDS maintained the largest number of datasheets (up to 10), but this reflects the 
comprehensive nature of the database being desi gned to support both research and community 
oriented surveys from either discrete sampling units or whole beaches and included a capacity for ad-
hoc reporting, source reporting and information about entanglements. It should be noted that once a 
research site had been set up, a survey within th e AMDS required (at most) four datasheets (Cheshire 
and Westphalen 2007) for the comprehensive resear ch survey and only 1 datasheet for community 
based surveys. 
Four surveys kept their data sheets to one double-sided page (NMDMP, NOWPAP – Benthic, KMMAF 
and the CCI), although this almost certainly poses lim its on the amount of incide ntal information that 
can be gathered.  
It also needs to be noted that the establishment of new site s for both the OSPAR and NMDMP 
required a range of data that are not in cluded on the standard survey sheets.  
Ideally, a survey should be undertaken with as few a number of datasheets as possible. 
Beach surveys 
29 Beach selection criteria  
Six of the nine beach survey protocols (AMD S, NMDMP, NOWPAP – Beach, KMMAF, OSPAR and 
CCAMLR) use criteria for the selection of beaches. At a basic level these relate to the need for modest 
slope such that the width of t he beach at low tide is not extreme (i.e. not a tidal sandflat where 
surveyors could become stranded or worse still overtaken by the tide as it comes in), the beach has to 
be long enough length to include the sampling unit(s) and the beach should not be subject to other 
clean up activities, although this is difficult to ac hieve in many areas. The NMDMP goes further to 
include a number of facets related to exposure to  open sea, substrate types (generally sand only), 
accessibility for su rvey team members (generally volunteers) and lim iting risks to endangered flora 
and fauna (Sheavly 2007). 
Some consideration needs to be given to beach se lection criteria, although the degree to which these 
constraints might affect litter accumulation must be incl uded. This relates in particular to restrictions on 
beach slope as this factor will have a direct relationship to the wave energy and the depositional 
nature of the site. 
30 General depositional  nature of the beach  
There are a large number of factors that indicate or are related to the depositional environment of a 
given beach, including; local and offshore currents, slope, aspect, length, tidal range, prevailing wind, 
etc. OSPAR (2007) indicate that  a generalised questionnaire was used to determine the nature of 
each beach, although the actual data collected are not explicitly spec ified. Cheshire and Westphalen 
(2007) developed a comprehensive list of parameters, although it may be argued that not all of these 
factors are necessarily important  with respect to litter deposition. The NMDMP obtains some 
information on the depositional nature of each beach (i n particular the conditions at the time of and 
immediately preceding each survey) but the specif ic descriptors are not clearly documented. The 
summary report (Sheavly 2007) does not make any inferences related to the depositional/energy 
environment in terms of litter fluxes. 
Three beach surveys (NOWPAP – Beach, ICC, WWF and the ICC survey) co llect no data on the 
depositional environment, which rest ricts the capacity to develop meaningful comparisons between 
locations (although note that these data do not apply to the CCI survey). Care should be given to 
employ descriptions of differences between surv ey sites in lieu of depositional data. Like litter 
characterization (see above), there is a need to dev elop standardized minimum criteria for describing 
the nature of each beach environment as even when data are collected, surveys vary substantially. 
31 Conditions at the time of the survey  
The prevailing conditions at the time of the litte r survey are considered to be important by some 
(Cheshire and Westphalen 2007, Sheavly 2007), although relatively few surveys appear to collect any APPENDIX B 
 
91 data (and only the AMDS is comprehensive). The NOWPAP – Beach, OSPAR, ICC, WWF and CCI 
protocols do not collect any data on this aspect.  
32 Anthropogenic influences  
Anthropogenic factors include access (pedestrian, vehi cular or boat), location (urban, peri-urban or 
rural) and proximity to sources (rivers, streams and towns) amongst others. These factors are yet 
another example of variables that may be included when comparing between locations, but again there are relatively few beach survey protocols that  invest resources in obtaining these data (note the 
AMDS and OSPAR protocols are exc eptions in this respect).  
33 Defining the landward edge of the survey  
Beach surveys tend to collect litter from betwe en the water level (preferably at low tide22) to what is 
frequently called the “back” of the beach. The latter a ppears to infer a limit defined by the presence of 
dunes, vegetation or a cliff base (see Sheavly 2007)  but in some instances the landward limit of a 
beach may be anthropogenic (i.e. a road, seawall or fence). Many surveys consider one or more of a 
number of factors, but few consider more than natural limits, and none are comprehensive. In some 
beach surveys (OSPAR and the ICC) this limit  does not appear to have been adequately defined. 
Whatever the limit may comprise, it is important that  this information is noted for each sampling unit. 
Firstly as this is yet another factor that may a ccount for variation between beaches but also so that 
consistency in data collection is maintained. 
Given that the width of each sampling unit will vary according to the landward constraint, litter 
characterization should favour reporting litter per unit of beach length rather than an areal basis. 
34 Defining the seaward edge of the survey  
Like the landward limit, beach surveys are often vague as to what defines the seaward limit of the 
sampling unit. It is a reasonable assumption that the water edge at the time of the observations forms 
a natural constraint and this has been used by most  surveys (5 in all; AMDS, NMDMP, CCAMLR and 
CCI), although the tidal di fferences at the time of the survey will alter the width of the sampling unit 
between surveys. Otherwise, litter collections at  low tide are certainly recommended (Sheavly 2007, 
CCAMLR 2008).  
Given that the tide will continuously alter the width of the beach, sampling units should be kept to a 
length such that the difference in tidal height over  the sampling period is limited. Changes in beach 
width during the survey add further weight to the need to report litter on per unit of beach length rather 
than area. 
Benthic and floating litter surveys 
There are too few benthic (NOWPAP – Benthic, ND NHI) and floating litter surveys (FAP and Japan) 
available for development of meaningful comparisons.  For this reason, the analysis of these sampling 
strategies includes reference to the broader lit erature and particularly to the descriptions and 
recommendations provided by Ribic et al. (1992). 
Benthic surveys 
35  Observation/data collection platform  
Benthic surveys may occur as either trawls or no n-collecting remote observations, with the latter 
including divers/snorkelers, camera tows or submer sible platforms. Side scan sonar has also been 
employed in benthic litter assessments, notably in rela tion to the fallout from Hurricane Katrina (NOAA 
2008).  
In Korea, a deepwater camera sled operation has b een used to assist targeting of trawl operations 
(Cho 2005). Similarly the NOWPAP Benthic survey re commends a “pre-survey” of a broader area (~ 
5000 × 5000 m) within which 1-3 trawls are targeted (~ 1000 × 1000 m areas each; NOWPAP 2007a). 
                                                      
22 Caution needs to be taken with beaches t hat have a shallow slope as the low tide mark may be quite distant from land and 
surveyors may become stranded by the incoming tide. Ideally however, such beaches should not be selected for survey. APPENDIX B 
 
92 36  Litter collections  
Other than benthic trawls, divers and snorkelers ma y also undertake clearance operations either from 
within discrete sampling units (NOWPAP 2007a) or on a less structured basis as in the surveys 
undertaken for the removal of fishing nets from Ha waiian reef systems (Donohue et al. 2001, Timmers 
et al. 2005). The ICC also collects underwater surveys conducted by divers/PADI Project AWARE 
(Sheavly pers. comm.). 
Litter collection by divers/snorkelers entails a num ber of additional safety aspects over and above 
those related to recreational diving/snorkelling.  
37 Targeted to specific locati ons (substrates, currents, etc)  
The Northwest Hawaiian Island surv ey (NDNHI) targ eted shallow, coral reef  systems, while NOWPAP 
– Benthic considered both nearshore diver and deep wa ter trawls within provinces of each of the 
member states.  
Like beach surveys, broader scale benthic surveys should be targeted at specific locations that are 
themselves embedded within broader regional units, with a view to obtaining repeated observations 
related to currents, land forms and proximity to sources. 
38 Nature of the seabed  
The nature of the seabed is an important factor in  defining the nature of the benthic survey with 
respect to the litter that might ac cumulate as well as the approach to sampling (Ribic et al. 1992). It 
needs to be recognized that benthic trawl operations are not without the risk of environmental damage 
to sessile communities but may also present risks to trawl operators with benthic snagging and 
associated equipment loss. 
39 Nature of trawl gear  
Trawl gear may comprise nets, grapples, rakes and similar (NOW PAP 2007a), with each targeting 
different broader types of litter (Ribic et al. 1992). The relative differences in sampling effort between 
different gear types needs to be established if comp arisons are to be achieved. Importantly, the nature 
of the vessel, trawl gear and transe ct characteristics (speed, length of tow, etc.) are important factors 
in determining the Catch Per Unit E ffort (CPUE) for each haul (Ribic et al. 1992). This is an important 
standardising factor when comparing between litter samples. 
40 Field of view angle  
The field of view relates to the width, measured as  an angle from the point of view of the observer, 
through cameras or windows and thus relates to camera tows, submersibles and to a lesser degree, 
observations by divers. When considered in conjunct ion with the viewing distance (as determined by 
visibility) the area covered by the observations can be calculated (e.g. a 500 m towed camera with a 4 
m wide field of view represents a survey area of 2,000 m2). Although camera tows are relatively 
popular for benthic litter surveys there is no published information on key parameters such as the 
nature of the camera, the field of view, angle relative to the seabed, etc. 
The Hawaiian observations of ghosts nets, made  extensive use of snorkelers on manta tows 
(Donohue et al. 2001), in these cases the horizontal wi dth of transects (and thus the area covered) is 
variable and ultimately determined by the observers  capacity to swerve from side to side.  
41 Limits on visibility  
Visibility limits on diver, submersi ble and camera observations are cr itical to determining the area of 
coverage accomplished within a survey (Ribic et al . 1992). Manta tow surveys in Hawaii report visibility 
limits at the start and end of eac h transect (Donohue et al. 2001). 
Floating litter 
Floating litter surveys may comprise ob servations of litter from surface vessels or aircraft, but in either 
case none of the litter is collected (e.g. Shiomoto and Kameda 2005). Alternatively floating litter 
surveys may comprise surface trawls. No examples of the latter were available for comparison. 
42 Observation/collection platform  
Floating litter observations or trawls may be undertaken from vessels, although aircraft (planes or helicopters) may also be employed. It should be noted that the use of aircraft in litter assessments is APPENDIX B 
 
93 not necessarily limited to floating litter. The Carpentaria Ghost Nets Program has used helicopters to 
assess the distribution of derelic t fishing nets on beaches in remote locations (Anon 2006).  
43 Repeated target survey (same route)  
The survey of floating litter around Japan (Shi omoto and Kameda 2005) appears to be a one-off 
survey and as such one cannot make inferences about variation through time. While the Floatables 
Action Plan (US Environment Protection Agency 2007)  uses spotter aircraft to direct skimmer vessels, 
there appears to be limited data capture within this survey (note that litter ch aracterization is not an 
objective of this survey).  
Clearly repeated observations of the same areas, in particular specific currents and proximity to 
sources would be required to obtain an understanding of floating litter dynamics. 
44 Nature of the observation platform and samples  
Information on the nature of the observation platfo rm is critical to comparing litter assessments 
between different vessels or aircraft (Ribic et al. 1992).  This includes the position, field of view, height 
above water and other factors that affect the samp le (such as speed, direction, time period and 
maximum viewing distance). The Japanese study em ployed the same vessel throughout and therefore 
had no need to collect vessel specific data (Shi omoto and Kameda 2005). However, unlike other sea 
based surveys, floating litter observat ions could be collected from different vessels that might travel 
the same route, in which case ship-related differences would be important.  
45  Conducted in association with other observations  
For some surveys other observations (e.g. marine  mammal counts or seabird activity) might be 
incorporated along with litter assessments.  
46 Vessel, gear and sample char acteristics for trawl operations  
Comparisons of results from trawl based surveys need to consider differences in the characteristics of 
the vessel used to undertake the survey as well as di fferences in trawl gear sp ecifically including mesh 
size, net size and depth of tow (Ribic et al. 1992). Each of these factors has the capacity to change 
both the sample size and the sampling effort. Similarl y, vessel speed, direction and position are critical 
factors with respect to sampling units (Ribic et al . 1992). Importantly, the nature of the vessel, trawl 
gear and transect characteristics (speed, length of to w, etc.) are important factors in determining the 
Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) for each haul (Ribic  et al. 1992), which is an important standardising 
factor when comparing between floating litter sampling results. 
Analysis and interpretation 
The preceding demonstrates that, while there are many differences between the various survey 
protocols, there were also a number of unifying features.  
In terms of the beach litter surveys, four sets of  protocols stand out as being quite detailed (high 
degree of specification) these being AMDS (the mo st highly prescribed system), NMDMP, OSPAR and 
CCAMLR. A second group, with a much lower level of  prescription in survey specifications comprise 
WWF, KMMAF, ICC and NOWPAP – B enthic. The final group comprises the CCI protocol which is 
very different from most others having a focus on o perational clean up of beaches as opposed to litter 
surveys. APPENDIX B 
 
94  
Figure 12. Cluster analysis illustrating the re lationship among survey protocols. Protocols 
are linked together according to their relative similarity using the data obtained from a 
comparative analysis of all beach surveys. The CCI protocol is an outlier (dissimilar to other 
protocols) which reflects its principal focus on operational clean up. AMDS, NMDMP, OSPAR and CCALMR are protocols with detailed specifications whereas the NOWPAP, ICC, KMMAF 
and WWF protocols are less prescriptive. 
 
In order to provide a simplified summary of the similarities and differences between the various 
surveys a multivariate analysis of  survey protocols was undertak en. Data relating to the key 
comparative criteria were assembled into a set of nu merical indices (for criteria with a yes/no answer 
these were simple binary indices) and this data set was then analysed using a classification analysis 
(McQuitty’s algorithm on a relative Euclidean distance matrix). 
The resultant plot (Figure 12) illustrates the relati onships between the protocols as discussed above. 
In general terms the objective in developing a un ified set of guidelines can only be achieved by 
identifying a good compromise between prescription  and pragmatism and learning from programmes 
that have a proven record of successful application.  
Principal issues to be resolved in developing standardized 
operational guidelines 
Findings from review of existing guidelines 
It is evident from that there has bee n a much greater effort put into developing specifications for beach 
litter surveys (see for example Ribic et al. 1992,  Rees and Pond 1995, ANZECC 1996a, Kiessling 
2003, Stuart 2003, Cheshire a nd Westphalen 2007, S heavly 2007, NOWPAP 2007b) than has been 
invested into developing guidelines for the assessme nt of either floating litter or benthic litter.  
A number of the surveys have been designed to s upport large scale, longer term surveys, including 
the AMDS, OSPAR and NMDMP protocols (Cheshir e and Westphalen 2007, OSPAR 2007, Sheavly 
2007). The higher level of complexity in the design  and implementation frameworks for these surveys 
reflect an increasing need to better manage marine litter problems as well as to better quantify 
ecological and ecosystem threats.  
The development of a standardized set of operational guidelines for marine litter assessment required 
the resolution of a number of principal issues as summarised below.  
1. Development of a standardized scheme for clas sification of marine litter which needs to 
consider how items are best categorised with reference to either: 
a. A hierarchy of material composition and form and/or 
b. Litter sources. Beach Surveys

95 2. There is a need to define how litter will be quantified and whether or not there is a need to 
apply the same principles to all classes of li tter. Candidate quantification schemes include:  
a. Presence/absence of litter items within a class. 
b. Weights of items within a class. c. Counts of items within a class. 
d. Combination of weights, counts and pot entially volumes of litter items within each 
class. 
3. Survey effort should be standardized or quant ified in order to adequately define the basic 
sampling unit. Options include: 
a. Area of beach – not preferr ed as the amount of litter is more related to linear distance 
of beach surveyed rather t han the width of the beach. 
b. Distance along a beach – generally a pref erred method but cannot be prescribed due 
to substantial differences in litter load between regions. 
c. Use of a hierarchy of scales based on item size as per the OSPAR system. 
d. Standardize sampling effort by using a fi xed number of person hours per sample. This 
could account for differences in litter loading and may be the best compromise. 
e. Defining sampling units on the accumulation rate of litter types versus the length (or 
area) of beach considered. 
4. The length of time between sampling events at any given location needs to be defined. The 
major challenge will be to balance survey effort with timing to obtain reasonable and 
comparable estimates of flux rates (the rate at  which new litter items accumulate on a beach). 
Likely alternatives are either monthly or seasonally (e.g. quarterly). It may be possible to 
define the minimum frequency but to allow for more frequent surveys in some areas. Given 
that beach surveys in many areas must work  around municipal cleaning, sampling frequency 
needs to be flexible. 
5. Regionalization systems for surveys need to be developed consistent with information on 
major currents, coastal features and proximity to  litter sources, although the latter issue could 
form a component of stratified sampling within r egions (Sheavly 2007). It is also important to 
consider a broader suite of issues that need to be encompassed when extending the regional 
context of surveys including the need to address  logistic and cost constraints for developing 
countries. 
6. Having identified a need for larger scale, l onger term litter studies, there will be a need to 
develop a management framework through the designation of a lead agencies with 
responsibility for:  
a. Identifying sampling locations; b. Identifying and engaging with stakeholders at the national/regional levels; 
c. Establishing a litter sampling management framework (i.e. the hierarchy of 
responsibilities within a region). This will include defining sampling locations, the 
recruitment and training of volunteers and establishment of lines of communication; 
d. Development and implementation of a data management and reporting platform. 
Whereas the Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup may provide a good 
framework through which some of the above can be  achieved, there are some critical issues 
that will need resolution. 
It is apparent that the published descriptions of  many marine litter survey protocols do not 
provide comprehensive specifications for m any of the background or  framework issues 
associated with the national or regional scale integr ation of survey results. This issue is seen 
most clearly when comparing the OSPAR (OSPAR 2007) or NMDMP (Sheavly 2007) survey 
protocols with the AMDS (Cheshire and West phalen 2007) protocols. In developing the 
specifications for the AMDS a great deal of work  was put into providing specific details of the APPENDIX B 
 
96 design and operation of a suitable relational  database system and the associated data 
recording frameworks. 
It is almost certain that some of the other prot ocols, particularly those that operate at national 
or regional scales, have considered these is sues but the documentation is not readily 
available. Indeed, in developing the AMDS prot ocols, Cheshire and Westphalen (2007) had to 
undertake a separate analysis of the NRETA23 and CCAMLR database and data 
specifications. It was found that they similarly had a complex set of specifications but that 
these were implicit and had never been extensively docum ented. Such issues will present 
significant challenges for the future development and maintenance of marine litter database 
systems. 
In moving to develop a set of unified operational guidelines for marine litter surveys such 
issues will need to be made explicit and work will be needed to develop specifications relating 
to database structures, storage and management.  
7. Standardized litter categorization and measurement 
Probably the most critical factor limiting comparisons between current surveys are the 
profound differences in litter characterization. The development of a standardized set of litter 
categories and measurement criteria will enable dat a integration and analysis across regions, 
allow backtracking of litter to sources, t he determination of ecological threats and the 
development of management strategies.  
It may be that existing surveys should be encouraged to continue in a more or less unaltered 
format, but with the provision that litter data is collected with reference to the standardized 
categories that can be readily transla ted to the survey-specific forms. 
8. Greater understanding of the dep ositional nature of survey sites 
For most litter surveys, irrespective of the ty pe, there is a lack of emphasis on measurements 
related to the depositional nature of the sample  locations. There is thus a considerable 
difficulty in making comparisons between locati ons as potential sources of variability are not 
included.
