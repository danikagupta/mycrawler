Materials for Artificial Cornea Applications

11 Abstract 
Device anchrJring of artificial cornea implants, through tissue integration of 
stromal tissue, is ne ::essary to ensure long-term success. In this work, the delivery of 
basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), a key modulator in corneal wound healing, via 
heparin modified m1terials was investigated as a means of sustained, soluble growth 
factor delivery for stimulation of device anchorage. Two materials types, commonly used 
for ophthalmic appli::ations and currently under investigation for use in artificial cornea 
applications, were Lltilized. Poly (dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) is currently under 
investigation as the base material for keratoprosthetic devices; dendrimer crosslinked 
collagen has been ex1mined as the basis for use as a tissue engineered corneal equivalent. 
PDMS surfaces were modified directly or indirectly, through a poly (ethylene 
oxide) (PEO) spacer, to contain functionalized reactive NSC groups capable of binding 
heparin and FGF-2 Surface modifications were characterized with attenuated total 
reflection Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (ATR-FTIR), X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angles. Heparin coverage was 
assessed with metachromatic and bioactivity assays. 
Heparinized collagen gels were crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl 
aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 
polypropyleneimine octaamine G2 dendrimers. Gel integrity was assessed with water 
uptake, differential sr::anning calorimetry, and heparin and dendrimer stability. 
Both materi1ls were exposed to radiolabelled FGF-2 and growth factor 
immobilization and delivery were quantified. Heparinized PDMS surfaces were capable 
111 of binding on average 100 ng/cm2 ofFGF-2, while heparinized collagen gels had higher 
FGF-2 immobilization, 300 ng, likely attributed to their higher heparin densities and the 
fact that the bulk gel rather than the surface only was modified. Delivery of FGF-2 from 
the heparinized materials revealed a first order release profile, with an initial burst of 
FGF-2, followed by gradual growth factor release. Release rates, over a 2 week period, 
reached 6.5% and 50%, for 1 day and 3 day FGF-2 exposed heparinized PDMS modified 
surfaces, while hepruinized dendrimer crosslinked collagen gels released 40%. 
lV Acknowledgements 
First and foremost I would like to acknowledge my supervisor Dr. H. Sheardown. 
She took a chance on me, having little experience with biological applications and a weak 
organic chemistry background. And if it was not for her acceptance, encouragement, 
guidance and supp01t, I don't think I would have had the confidence or knowledge to 
succeed. She was always an email away and willing to make time for inspiring chats. I 
am forever grateful to her for this opportunity, and for the next degree to come. 
I would also like thank the past and present members of our research group, Dr. 
K. Jones, and resear1;hers of Dr. K. Jones and Dr. J. Brash, for taking an interest in my 
work, humouring my many thoughts and questions, and helping to make my masters an 
enjoyable experienct:. All the friends I've made during this time also deserve thanks for 
their welcoming cha1s and great memories. 
A heartfelt thank you must go to my family, both immediate and extended, for all 
their love and suppo1t. All the guidance and encouragement, especially the determination 
of my father to rescue me from introversion, which helped me reach this 
accomplishment, will never be forgotten. I'd especially like to thank Derek for his 
understanding and patience, especially during the final crunch time, and all those 
wonderful home cooked meals. 
Lastly, I'd like to dedicate this thesis to the spirit of my mother. Although I was 
too young to know her as a researcher, her desire to continue her education and impact 
her research commw1ity will always be an inspiration to me.

1. INTRODUC1LION 
Cornea diseases or corneal trauma are a major cause of blindness, second only to 
cataracts (Whitcher, :Srinivasan, and Upadhyay. 2001). The most successful treatment is 
an allograft corneal transplant, which has a reported 80% success rate for the first 2 years 
(Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). Despite the high success rates, long-term graft 
rejection still occurs, with a failure rate of 65% after 5 years, a number which is further 
complicated by poor patient pre-operative conditions (Corvol, Malemud, and Sokoloff. 
1972; Griffith et al 2003). Furthermore, the National Coalition for Vision Health 
documented 2,602 cornea transplants performed across Canada in 2001; however, at this 
time there were 3,:~69 Canadians who were still awaiting transplantation (National 
Coalition for Vision Health. 2005). Given the aging population and the increasing 
popularity of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), which renders corneas inappropriate 
for transplantation, donor demand is estimated to continue to surpass eye bank supplies. 
An alternative to cornea transplantations, usually used in the cases where host 
tissue is too diseased for allografts or where allograft surgery is prone to high rates of 
failure, are the use of artificial cornea replacements in the form of keratoprostheses or 
tissue engineered corneal equivalents (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). A 
suitable artificial cornea replacement must be non toxic, interact well with host tissue and 
have similar physical characteristics to the natural cornea, including transparency, 
appropriate refractiv~ index, as well as adequate tensile strength, and high permeability to 
oxygen and cell nu1rients (Chirila et al. 1998; Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006; 
Griffith et al. 2003). 
- 1 ­Masters Thesi; -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
Furthermore, for long term success, the artificial cornea should integrate 
seamlessly with the host tissue. As shown in Figure 1-1, successful host integration 
potentially requires [nteractions between the device and all three cornea layers, the 
epithelium, stroma, and endothelium (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). 
Figure 1-1. Requirements for an artificial cornea. An artificial corneal implant 
requires integration with all three corneal cell types through epithelial coverage, 
stromal ingrowth, endothelial compatibility and the regeneration of nerve cells. 
Specifically, the device must support epithelial overgrowth on the anterior surface 
for a wettable and sdf renewing layer but avoid epithelial downgrowth and subsequent 
device extrusion (Carlsson et al. 2003). Stromal integration involves fibroblast 
infiltration and exttacellular matrix production to avoid device exposure and tissue 
necrosis. Finally et1dothelial cell compatibility and support of nerve regeneration is 
necessary for corneal health. Many ofthe interactions between these cells and the natural 
-2­Masters Thesis- M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
corneal extracellular matrix are mediated by growth factors, many of which are 
sequestered by heparan sulphate proteoglycans through highly specific heparin binding 
sites for delivery in soluble form. 
Therefore, in the current work, heparin modification of artificial cornea materials 
was examined as a method of facilitating the delivery of growth factors to promote 
corneal cell interactions with these materials. Specifically, the potential of the materials 
for delivering the stromal stimulating growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF­
2) for promoting cellular interactions was examined.

2. BACKGROUND 
2.1 	 THE CORNEA 
The cornea is a tough, elastic and transparent tissue at the front of the eye that 
serves as the eye's primary refractive element and protects the internal ocular structures 
against pathological agents (Chirila et al. 1998; Krachmer, Mannis, and Holland. 2005). 
The cornea is heavily innervated with sensory nerve fibres, avascular and thus immune 
privileged. As illustrated in Figure 2-1, the cornea consists of five layers: the epithelium; 
the Bowman's laye:, (BL); the stroma; the Descemet's membrane (DM); and the 
endothelium.

1996; Ojeda, Ventosa, and Piedra. 2001). 
-4­Masters Thesis-M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
The epithelicm consists of three phenotypes of non-keratinized, stratified 
squamous epithelial cells, arranged in 5 to 6 cellular layers. Cells are connected through 
tight intercellular junctions, creating a semi-permeable membrane for hydration, and a 
highly protective barrier against environmental threats. The first few layers consist of 
superficial epithelial cells that stabilize the tear film and prevent dehydration of the 
cornea. Beneath this are the epithelial wing cells, with a posterior layer of basal 
epithelial cells that rest on a basement membrane of collagen type IV and laminin, 
adjacent to Bowman's layer (BL). BL is comprised of Type I and III collagen fibrils as 
well as proteoglycans, such as the heparin sulphate proteoglycan, perlecan (Krachmer, 
Mannis, and Holland. 2005; Zieske. 2001). 
The stroma, representing 90% of the total cornea thickness, is a highly structured 
layer of keratocytes, nerve fibres, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. This 
layer provides the cornea with its strength, stability and transparency (Chirila et al. 1998; 
Fini. 1999; Krachmer, Mannis, and Holland. 2005). Keratocytes are scarce, spindle­
shaped cells, connec·:ed to one another and the ECM via long and narrow gap junctions. 
They produce ECM constituents to maintain cornea strength and function, contain actin 
filaments, which allow the cells to contract and perhaps ultimately influence cornea 
shape, express corneal crystallin proteins responsible for transparency through destructive 
interference of scattering light, and display integrins to relay ECM information. These 
cells are greatly influenced by the ECM and by any injury to the stromal layer, whereby 
they can become activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (Fini. 1999). 
- 5 ­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
The ECM of the stromal layer is comprised of collagen, mainly type I with minute 
amounts of types III, V and VI, water, and glycosaminoglycans (Chirila et al. 1998; Meek 
and Boote. 2004 ). The collagen is arranged into thin, uniformly parallel fibrils, layered 
orthogonally to provide strength and transparency, by scattering light via destructive 
interference (Chirila et al. 1998; Fini. 1999). Keratocytes also produce matrix 
metalloproteinases (I\1MPs) to degrade collagen and restructure the ECM; however this is 
tightly regulated by cytokines and the turnover of collagen in the ECM is quite slow in a 
healthy cornea, averaging a 2-3 year time span (Krachmer, Mannis, and Holland. 2005). 
The glycosaminoglycans within the stroma, with the exception of hyaluronan, bind to 
core proteins to form proteoglycans (Krachmer, Mannis, and Holland. 2005). For 
instance, glycosamin)glycans containing chondroitin or dermatan sulphate combine with 
decorin, while those containing keratin sulphates can bind to lumican, keratocan or 
mimecan (Krachmer, Mannis, and Holland. 2005; Zieske. 2001). Through cell and ECM 
interactions, proteoglycans also influence collagen fibril formation and thus stroma 
transparency (Kracluner, Mannis, and Holland. 2005; Michelacci. 2003; Rada, Comuet, 
and Hassell. 1993). Proteoglycans have the potential to retain water and together with the 
endothelium, they m:tintain the homeostatic hydration of the stroma (Krachmer, Mannis, 
and Holland. 2005). 
The stroma lies on the highly elastic and strong DM, which contains type IV 
collagen fibrils, as well as laminin, and fibronectin (Chirila et al. 1998; Krachmer, 
Mannis, and Holland. 2005). The posterior side of the DM is adjacent to the 
endothelium, which consists of a single layer of hexagonal endothelial cells. The 
-6 ­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
endothelium is responsible for hydrating the stroma through its ion transport with the 
eye's aqueous humour. 
2.2 STROMAL \VOUND HEALING 
Wound healing occurs to restore tissue structure and function after extensive 
trauma. The wound healing response differs according to the size and depth of injury, 
which in turn influences the healing rate (months versus years), and scar tissue formation 
(Zieske. 2001 ). It is mediated by cell migration, proliferation, adhesion, and 
differentiation, all o:~chestrated by various signaling proteins, such as growth factors. 
Growth factors are t=olypeptides that stimulate or inhibit a variety of cellular activities, 
and affect their own cellular regulation through the up-or down-regulation of receptors 
and cellular gene expression (Lee. 2000). They typically remain inactive or as partially 
inactive precursors, usually in the ECM, only to be activated during wound healing via 
proteolytic cleavage md subsequently binding to cellular receptors (Lee. 2000). 
Stromal wound healing is a complex cascade of events orchestrated by cellular 
interactions, apoptosis, proliferation and migration, matrix production and remodelling 
and eventual wound closure. A generalized corneal wound healing cascade 1s 
summarized in Figure 2-2 (Klenkler and Sheardown. 2004; Wilson et al. 2001). 
A wound that penetrates the epithelium and BL and goes into the stroma severs 
intercellular communications and damages cells and the surrounding ECM (Wilson, Lui, 
and Mohan. 1999; ·wilson, Netto, and Ambrosio. 2003). Stroma wound healing begins 
with keratocyte apo otosis which creates an acellular void that is believed to stimulate 
subsequent wound healing responses (Zieske. 2001 ). The keratocyte apoptosis is a 
-7­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
consequence of released signalling proteins from damaged epithelial cells, including 
interleukin (IL)-1 ligands (IL-la & IL-l~) and soluble Fas ligands (Mohan et al. 1997; 
Wilson et al. 1996). Released signalling proteins diffuse into the stromal layer, 
stimulating keratocytes to produce Fas, which in turn binds to the Fas receptors on 
keratocytes to indu~e apoptosis (Ahmadi and Jakobiec. 2002). However, other 
mechanisms may be present, as Fas knockout mice with induced corneal injury also 
exhibited keratocyte apoptosis, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and 
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-~) also induced keratocyte apoptosis in vitro 
(Mohan et al. 1997; Wilson, Lui, and Mohan. 1999). Also, there is the hypothesis that 
intercellular connections between keratocytes may transmit an apoptosis signal (Wilson, 
Netto, and Ambrosio. 2003). Despite the mystery of keratocyte apoptosis, it is believed 
to initiate the next :;tages of wound healing (Krachmer, Mannis, and Holland. 2005; 
Zieske. 2001).

Keratocyte apoptosis is followed by the transformation of surrounding keratocytes 
into a fibroblast phenotype, evidenced by an increase in size, and altered organelle 
population, morpho] ogy and protein expression (Fini. 1999). They cease to express 
corneal crystallin proteins but gain a fibronectin receptor. As they proliferate and migrate 
- 9 ­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
into the wound, they deposit various ECM components atypical of the healthy stroma, 
forming a provisional matrix. It has been demonstrated that the composition of the 
provisional matrix stimulates fibroblast migration and may facilitate wound repopulation 
during wound healiug (Andresen et al. 2000; Zieske. 2001). This provisional matrix 
consists of various :jCM components, such as collagen IV, collagen VII, laminin-1, 
fibronectin and tenasdn ( Garana et al. 1992; Latvala et al. 1995; Zieske. 2001 ). Collagen 
types I and III are abo secreted but have not been shown to influence cell migration and 
proliferation in the provisional matrix (Andresen et al. 2000; Zieske. 2001). 
Proteoglycan production is altered as keratin sulpate proteoglycans are down-regulated, 
while decorin sulphate proteoglycans are generated (Hassell et al. 1983). This atypical 
ECM, together with the absence of crystallin, results in the formation of an opaque scar 
tissue (Fini. 1999). 
Fibroblast phenotypic transformation follows, whereby activated fibroblasts are 
transformed into m:rofibroblasts (Fini. 1999). This transformation is attributable to 
platelet derived gro'.vth factor (PDGF) and transforming· growth factor beta (TGF-~) 
(Jester et al. 1996; J~~ster et al. 2002). The myofibroblast phenotype is characterized by 
a-smooth muscle actin expression, and increased appearance of intracellular actin stress 
fibres and cell focal adhesions (Jester et al. 1994; Jester, Rodrigues, and Herman. 1987). 
Myofibroblasts conttact the wound by binding intracellular stress fibers and a-actin to the 
transmembrane protein, a1~2-integrin, which in tum has a high affinity for binding 
extracellular fibrone:::tin, pulling the wound together in a "shoe-string" manner (Jester, 
Petroll, and Cavanagh. 1999). 
-10­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
Myfibroblast mediated wound contraction is followed by ECM remodelling, 
whereby the synthesized provisional matrix is remodelled by surrounding cells, to reform 
tissue similar to an unwounded cornea (Fini and Stramer. 2005; Fini. 1999). 
Remodelling is greatly influenced by matrix metaproteinases (MMP) that remodel the 
arrangement of collagen fibrils. MMP-1, or collagenase, degrades type 1 collagen by 
attacking its triple helix; MMP-3, or stomelysin-1, degrades proteoglycans; gelatinase A, 
or MMP-2, degrades fibronectin, collagen, and basement membrane components; while 
MMP-9, or gelatinase B, denatures collagen, basement membrane components and 
elastin, and may also influence cell migration into the ECM. 
Finally, myof[broblasts either transform back to a quiescent keratocyte phenotype, 
or like some inflammatory cells, undergo apoptosis or necrosis, to restore corneal 
homeostasis (Fini. H99; Wilson et al. 2001). As well epithelial cells repopulate the 
anterior surface. 
It should be noted that stromal wound healing irregularities often occur after 
severe injury whereby the stromal collagen fibrils are not as homogeneous as before, thus 
obstructing cornea chrity (Krachmer, Mannis, and Holland. 2005). With the replacement 
of normal corneal ti;;sue with scar tissue, the original strength of the cornea does not 
return, resulting in an average loss of tensile strength of 70% (Krachmer, Mannis, and 
Holland. 2005). In some instances, the resulting keratocyte phenotype is irregular, or 
fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are still present, which interrupts light scattering (Fini and 
Stramer. 2005; Krachmer, Mannis, and Holland. 2005). Also, the keratocyte population 
may be too dense fo~ optimal transparency and newly infiltrating nerve fibers may lack 
-11 ­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
normal sensitivity (Krachmer, Mannis, and Holland. 2005). There are also the 
imbalances associated with abnormal or prolonged signaling protein expression. For 
instance, over-expression of certain growth factors can lead to epithelial hyperplasia and 
subsequent vision loss (Klenkler and Sheardown. 2004). However, certain growth 
factors, specifically PDGF and fibroblast growth factor-2 have a beneficial role in 
enhancing the wound healing process (Fini and Stramer. 2005). 
2.2.1 Growth Fact,ns in Corneal Wound Healing 
Throughout the corneal wound healing process, varwus growth factors are 
released by the lacrimal gland, corneal cells or infiltrating inflammatory cells that 
regulate wound heal[ng, specifically cell proliferation and migration, as illustrated in 
Figure 2-3 (Imanishi ~~tal. 2000; Klenkler and Sheardown. 2004). 
Upon stromal injury and disruption of BL, signalling proteins from the lacrimal 
gland, tear fluid, and corneal epithelial layer are able to diffuse into the stroma and 
influence wound healing, whereas in a healthy cornea, these signalling proteins would not 
normally be present 1:Fini and Stramer. 2005). Inflammatory cells, such as monocytes, 
macro phages, granubcytes and T -cells, arrive to the wound site from limbal blood 
vessels or the tear film (Wilson et al. 2001 ). Their summoning is believed to be brought 
on by injured epithelial cells that release interleukin-1 (IL-l) and tumour necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-a). This further activates keratocytes to produce inflammatory chemotatic 
agents, such as mot1ocyte chemotactic protein-! (MCP-1) and granulocyte colony 
stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Hong et al. 2001; Tran et al. 1996). These inflammatory 
cells are believed to remove cell debris from keratocytes that undergo apoptosis (Wilson 
-12­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
et al. 2001 ). It ha;; also been hypothesized that monocytes and macrophages may 
undergo phenotypic transformation into fibroblasts, similar to what occurs in bone 
resorption where ost~~oblasts are derived from macrophages and monocytes. However; 
there is no current re~:earch which supports this theory (Wilson et al. 2001).

permission (Imanishi et al. 2000; Klenkler and Sheardown. 2004). 
As mentioned earlier, keratocyte apoptosis is stimulated by IL-l and TNF-a, that 
1s released from damaged epithelial cells and from the tears. IL-l also activates 
keratocytes to secrete keratocyte growth factor (KGF) and hepatocyte growth factor 
(HGF), which further influence wound healing (Weng et al. 1997). KGF and HGF, also 
secreted from the lacrimal gland (Li et al. 1996; Wilson, Liang, and Kim. 1999), 
-13­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
stimulate epithelial and endothelial proliferation and migration and keratocyte 
proliferation, but fail to stimulate fibroblasts (Carrington and Boulton. 2005; Wilson et al. 
1993). Besides IL-l, cytokines IL-6 and TNF stimulates epithelial cell migration in the 
presence of fibronectin (Wang et al. 1994). Endothelial cells can also express IL-l and 
its receptor (Hoppenr~ijs et al. 1996). 
PDGF releas1~d from the damaged BL influences fibroblast migration, and 
stimulates the further secretion ofHGF and KGF (Li and Tseng. 1997; Seppa et al. 1982). 
PDGF also stimulate 3 epithelial cell migration, but only in the presence of fibronectin; 
this most likely occllfs once the provisional matrix is laid (Kamiyama et al. 1998). 
Endothelial cells exr:ress PDGF, which also induces endothelial cell proliferation and 
migration (Iguchi et al. 1995; Imanishi et al. 2000; Kamiyama et al. 1995). 
Epidermal growth factor (EGF), from the lacrimal gland (Wilson, Liang, and 
Kim. 1999), epithelium and stroma (Wilson et al. 1999), induces epithelial and 
endothelial cell proliferation. Keratocytes exposed to EGF have demonstrated weak 
proliferation through low affinity EGF membrane receptors (Imanishi et al. 2000; Joyce 
et al. 1995; Wilson e1 al. 1994). EGF stimulated epithelial migration has been observed, 
and is enhanced in be presence of fibronectin (Nishida et al. 1992; Sheardown et al. 
1997). 
Fibroblast grcwth factor (FGF-2) and its receptors are expressed by all three 
corneal cell types as well as by the lacrimal gland (Hoppenreijs et al. 1996). FGF-2 can 
influence the migm:ion and proliferation of epithelial cells (Grant et al. 1992), 
-14­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
keratocytes (Andresen, Ledet, and Ehlers. 1997) and endothelial cells (Gospodarowicz, 
Mescher, and Birdwell. 1977; Hoppenreijs et al. 1994; Hoppenreijs et al. 1996). 
Activated TGF-~, produced by all corneal cell types (Ahmadi and Jakobiec. 2002) 
and the lacrimal gland (Yoshino et al. 1996), acts as an inhibitor for HGF, KGF and EGF 
expression, and is thought to control excess epithelial cell proliferation (Imanishi et al. 
2000). As well, TGF-~, released from epithelial cells, acts as a chemotactic agent for 
corneal fibroblasts, and stimulates alpha smooth muscle actin expression in keratocytes, 
in vitro (Ahmadi and Jakobiec. 2002). However, TGF-~ expression is inhibited by FGF­
2, which may counter balance the effects of TGF-~ during corneal wound healing (Song 
et al. 2002). 
Other growth factors are also active in the wounded cornea. Insulin-like growth 
factor (IGF), isolated in the epithelium and stroma (Saghizadeh et al. 2001), has been 
shown to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Choi et al. 1995; 
Hoppenreijs et al. 1996), and keratocyte migration (Andresen, Ledet, and Ehlers. 1997). 
Nerve growth factm (NGF) has been detected in the all layers of the cornea and can 
stimulate epithelial and stromal proliferation, and may be linked to fibroblast 
differentiation into myofibroblasts (Lambiase et al. 1998; Micera et al. 2006; You, Kruse, 
and Volcker. 2000). Also present in the cornea are bone morphogenic protein (BMP), 
which has been shown to induce fibroblast migration, and vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), whc may play a role in corneal neovascularization (Kim et al. 1999; 
Saghizadeh et al. 2001; van Setten. 1997). 
-15­Masters Thes; s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
During corneal wound healing, growth factors also regulate provisional matrix 
remodelling, through stromal synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and collagen 
(Fini and Stramer. 2005). IL-l and TNF have been shown to up-regulate collagenases 
(MMP-1, and -13) aad stromelysins (MMP-3, -10, and -11) (Li de et al. 2003), while 
TGF-~1 can stimulat•! them in addition to gelatinase (MMP-9) (Kim et al. 2004). PDGF 
influences MMP-1 and -9 expression (Ahmadi and Jakobiec. 2002), and there is evidence 
that FGF-2 stimulates MMP-1 production by stromal cells (Strissel, Rinehart, and Fini. 
1997). Collagen production is mediated by IL-6, which both increases collagen 
production and inhibits MMP-2 production (Malecaze et al. 1997), and TGF-~ which 
decreases collagenast:: production (Strissel, Rinehart, and Fini. 1995). 
2.3 BASIC FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR (FGF -2) 
Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), is a 18 kDa protein consisting of 146 
amino acids arrangt:d into 12 anti-parallel ~-sheets, further folded into a trigonal 
pyramidal structure (JIJ"ugent and Iozzo. 2000; Okada-Ban, Thiery, and Jouanneau. 2000). 
It contains 4 cystein~s and many basic residues, giving it an isoelectric point of 9.6. 
Figure 2-4 illustrates ;l stereo view ofFGF-2 (Faham, Linhardt, and Rees. 1998). 
FGF-2 is found in the normal ECM (Aktas and Kayton. 2000), in many basement 
membranes (Folkman et al. 1988), and in many tissues and cells, including the retina 
(Ohsato et al. 1997), aqueous humour (Tripathi, Borisuth, and Tripathi. 1992), cornea 
epithelium (Wilson, Lloyd, and He. 1992; van Setten, Fagerholm, and Cuevas-Sanchez. 
1995), neural tissue~,, pituitary (Marin and Boya. 1995), placenta (Florkiewicz and 
Sommer. 1989), and smooth muscle and endothelial cells (Cordon-Cardo et al. 1990). 
-16­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
Figure 2-4. A stereo view of the FGF-2 molecule. Awaiting permission 
(Mohammadi, Olser1, and Ibrahimi. 2005). 
Within the cc;:ll, the 18kDa FGF -2 is localized in the cytoplasm, while larger 
isoforms of FGF-2 <22, 22.5 and 24 kDa) have been detected in the cell nucleus. 
However, their cellular role is yet unknown (Powers, McLeskey, and Wellstein. 2000; 
Renko et al. 1990). 
The ECM a~~ts as a reservmr for FGF-2, as a means of regulating its 
bioavailability (Flaumenhaft et al. 1989; Folkman et al. 1988), and to protect against acid 
and heat denaturation (Gospodarowicz and Cheng. 1986), and proteolytic cleavage 
(Saksela et al. 1988; Sommer and Rifkin. 1989). To regulate FGF-2 bioavailability, its 
release from the EC:\1 by controlled polysaccharide degradation, either by enzymatic 
cleavage, with protea3es or heparanases, or by binding to a carrier protein, FGF binding 
protein, which can transport FGF-2 to cell receptors (Powers, McLeskey, and Wellstein. 
2000). Despite the large amount of FGF-2 in the ECM reservoir (10-500 ng/mL), its 
release is highly regulated by extracellular matrix proteoglycans, as there is a low molar 
concentration required to activate its receptors (Powers, McLeskey, and Wellstein. 2000). 
-17­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
2.3.1 Cell Secretion 
FGF-2 is secreted by many cell types, including fibroblasts (Akimoto et al. 1999; 
Aktas and Kayton. 2000) and macrophage cells (Akimoto et al. 1999; Sunderkotter et al. 
1991). In contrast ether synthesized proteins, which are secreted via the endoplasmic 
reticulum and Golgi pathway, FGF-2, lacking a consensus signal peptide (Mignatti, 
Morimoto, and Rifki:l. 1992), is secreted by a different, as yet unknown mechanism. It 
has been suggested that secretion is possibly a passive process, through apoptosis, or 
physical injury, as in vitro induced cellular injury has stimulated vascular smooth muscle 
cells (Crowley et al. 1995) and endothelial cells (Gajdusek and Carbon. 1989; McNeil et 
al. 1989) to release FGF-2. Other studies with FGF-1, which also lacks a signal sequence 
for secretion, suggest that high temperatures (42°C, 2 hr) can induce release (Jackson et 
al. 1992). However, under these conditions, FGF-1 had lost its bioactivity, mostly likely 
due to thermally induced protein denaturation. The other hypothesis involves non-lethal 
membrane disruptions, such as exocytosis, or vesicles, whereby FGF-2 is translocated 
across the cell phsma membrane (Schafer et al. 2004). However, earlier 
immunofluorescent localization of FGF-2 failed to locate it in secretory vesicles (Renko 
et al. 1990), and to date, the secretion process remains unresolved. 
2.3.2 Biological Functions 
FGF-2 is pleiotropic, via intracrine, autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. It 
stimulates proliferation in many cells phenotypes including fibroblasts (Mignatti, 
Morimoto, and Rifkin. 1991; Shipley et al. 1989), endothelial cells (Sa and Fox. 1994 ), 
keratinocytes (O'Keefe, Chiu, and Payne. 1988; Shipley et al. 1989), chrondrocytes 
-18­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
(Corvol, Malemud, :md Sokoloff. 1972; Kato et al. 1983) and smooth muscle cells 
(Skaletz-Rorowski et al. 1996). In vitro studies with endothelial cells indicate a 
chemotactic and mitogenic role to FGF-2 (Galzie, Kinsella, and Smith. 1997). FGF-2 
can also stimulate the migration of other cells, such as circulating macrophages 
(Sunderkotter et al. 1994), to the area, which may in turn stimulate the release of 
additional FGF-2 or ')ther growth factors, to influence other cellular responses (DeBlois, 
Cote, and Doillon. 1994; Pieper et al. 2002). Release of FGF-2 in low concentration 
(nanogram and pictogram) amounts, has been shown to stimulate local FGF-2 expression 
(Edelman et al. 1991: Pieper et al. 2002). 
FGF-2 is a mediator of angiogenesis, neovascularization, wound healing (Tsuboi 
and Rifkin. 1990), embryonic development (Cohn et al. 1995; Kimelman et al. 1988), 
neuronal developmel1t, vascular tone (Zhou et al. 1998) and regeneration of bone, 
cartilage (Cuevas, Burgos, and Baird. 1988), nerve (Ortega et al. 1998) and retinal tissues 
(Ozaki et al. 1998). A few biological functions ofFGF -2 are summarized in Table 2-1. 
A lack of or inappropriate expression of FGF-2 can result in various pathological 
conditions, including tumour growth (Bikfalvi et al. 1997). For example, theoretical 
strategies for cancer treatment have included the suppression of angiogenesis to tumour 
cells through inhibition of FGF-2 signaling, which has been shown to inhibit pancreatic 
cancer in vitro and ir.! vivo (Wagner et al. 1998). FGF-2 is down regulated by interferons 
a and Pin human carcinomas and systemic administration of interferon a inhibits FGF-2 
expression (Okada-Ban, Thiery, and Jouanneau. 2000). A few pathological implications 
associated with irregular FGF-2 expression are summarized in Table 2-2.

FGF-2 cell si5nalling involves its association with cell surface fibroblast growth 
factor receptors (FGFRs), of which there are two forms, FGFR-1 and FGFR-2, capable of 
equal FGF-2 interaction (Quarto and Amalric. 1994). FGFRs are transmembrane 
proteins with an extracellular immunoglobulin domain, a single-membrane-spanning 
domain and an intm~ellular tyrosine kinase domain, of which the there are many sub-
variants differing in the extracellular domain. FGF-2 mainly binds to FGFRs with high 
affinity, but there is also a FGFR low affinity binding site capable of heparin binding 
(D'Amore. 1990; Venkataraman et al. 1999). The number of FGFRs per cell varies based 
on cell type and FGF concentration, mainly ranging from 103-104 receptors/cell (Conrad. 
1998). A second receptor lies on cell surfaces, comprised of heparin sulphate 
proteoglycans, which has low affinity binding for FGF-2, and will be discussed in a 
subsequent section. 
2.3.3 	 FGF-2- FG:li'R Interactions 
To activate FGFR, FGF-2 must dimerize the receptor to activate the tyrosine 
kinase, which results in autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine residues for 
subsequent stimulation of cellular signal transduction pathways (Coughlin et al. 1988; 
-22­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
Dailey et al. 2005). FGF-2 activates a number of cellular responses by phosphorylating 
intracellular proteins in a series of cascade reactions, leading to nuclear translocation 
where transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated. 
Atypical to rr.any growth factors, FGF-2 does not degrade in the lysosome after 
interacting with its receptors but rather truncates into various polypeptides (Galzie, 
Kinsella, and Smith. 1997). These polypeptides are translocated into the cell cytoplasm 
and into the nucleus, and are further believed to stimulate growth signals (Hawker and 
Granger. 1992; Olsn;:s, Klingenberg, and Wiedlocha. 2003; Wesche et al. 2006). This 
unique translocation to the nucleus is due to interactions between FGF -2 and heparan 
sulphate proteoglycans. 
2.4 HEPARAN SULPHATE PROTEOGLYCANS 
Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPs) are sulphated glycosaminoglycans, 
heterogeneous in structure, produced by many cell types (Gallagher, Lyon, and Steward. 
1986). They consist of a protein core with carbohydrate side chains. The main protein 
cores are syndecan, glypican, perlecan, CD44 and betaglycan (Galzie, Kinsella, and 
Smith. 1997). 
HSPs are found in the ECM, in many basement membranes, and on cell 
membranes, as low affinity binding sites. They aid with cell adhesion, growth factor 
receptor activation end FGF-2 signalling (Dowd, Cooney, and Nugent. 1999; Hagen, 
Michael, and Butkowski. 1993; Kwan et al. 2001; Nugent and Iozzo. 2000). HSPs can 
bind cells and to ECM components, namely collagen, fibronectin and laminin, through 
specific electrostatic interactions (Gallagher, Lyon, and Steward. 1986; Koda, Rapraeger, 
-23­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
and Bemfield. 1985). HSP-ECM complexes have increased stability with high molecular 
weight glycosaminoglycans, possibly due to increased HSP protein interactions (Salchert 
et al. 2004). HSPs also have binding sites for many growth factors, including FGF-2, 
VEGF, TGF-~, NGF, and PDGF (Zamora et al. 2002). HSP-FGF-2 binding have been 
shown to increase its thermal stability (Gospodarowicz and Cheng. 1986) and protect it 
from tryptic and chynotryptic digestion (Sommer and Rifkin. 1989) as well as plasmin 
induced proteolytic degradation (Saksela et al. 1988). Proteases including heparanase 
and plasmin, can cleave HSP bonds in the ECM and release FGF-2 for cellular 
stimulation, or can cleave HSP side chains still bonded to FGF-2 for increased 
biostability and bioactivity (Bashkin et al. 1989; Saksela and Rifkin. 1990). 
2.4.1 HSP-FGF -~: Interactions 
HSP and FGF -2 interactions are polyionic, whereby the positively charged site on 
FGF-2 ionically binds to the acidic segments of HSPs, with low affinity (Tabata. 2000). 
Binding in vitro has been shown to be dependant on FGF-2 concentration and exposure 
time (Moscatelli. 19512). An in vitro cell culture exposed to FGF -2 for a short time will 
give a prolonged celllllar response after the FGF-2 removed, due to FGF-2 bound to HSP 
cell receptors (Galzie, Kinsella, and Smith. 1997). 
Of recent interest is the idea that membrane HSP congregate towards lipid rich 
areas and the influence of environment on FGF-2 binding (Chu, Buczek-Thomas, and 
Nugent. 2004). The results indicated that disruption of the lipid raft hindered FGF-2 
binding and increased its dissociation from the cell surface. It was further suggested that 
these lipid clusters m1y aid the autophosphorylation ofdimer membrane receptors. 
-24­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
2.4.2 HSP- FGF -2 Internalization 
There is evidence of internalized HSP-FGF -2 complexes, which may explain the 
high levels of FGF-2 within the cell cytoplasm and its translocation to the nucleus 
(Amalric et al. 1994; Hsia, Richardson, and Nugent. 2003). Upon internalization of 
HSPs, there are two possible pathways: HSP degradation; and cleavage of HSPs into 
smaller, but long lasting, oligo-or polysaccharides that can bind to intracellular FGF-2, 
providing it with increased resistance against cellular catabolic reactions (Conrad. 1998; 
Reiland and Rapraegr~r. 1993; Sperde and Nugent. 1998). HSP is believed to accelerate 
FGF-2 nuclear locali:mtion and regulate nuclear delivery (Sperde and Nugent. 1998). 
2.4.3 	 HSP -FGF-2 -FGFR Interactions 
Interactions bl~tween HSPs, FGF-2 and FGFR have also been observed and there 
are many proposed rrodels (Figure 2-5) (Powers, McLeskey, and Wellstein. 2000). The 
significance of these .nteractions correlates to the stabilizing effect of HSP on the FGF -2 
and FGFR complex, ereating high affinity binding (Forsten-Williams, Chua, and Nugent. 
2005). There is also evidence that the binding of FGF-2 to HSP induces a conformal 
change in the FGF-2 molecule (Figure 2-6(a) and (b)), which may present it to the FGFR 
in a way that favours [ts integration (Powers, McLeskey, and Wellstein. 2000; Prestrelski, 
Fox, and Arakawa. 1992).

molecules. (c) HSP may allow the formation of FGF-2 dimers which then bind to

(e) HSP may facilitate the bivalent interaction between one FGF-2 and two FGFRs. 
Awaiting permission (Mohammadi, Olsen, and lbrahimi. 2005). 
One interaction model depicts HSP binding to two FGF-2 molecules thereby 
creating a dimeric molecule that easily dimerizes two FGFRs (Figure (6c)). A second 
model has HSP interacting with one FGF-2 and one FGFR creating a dimer between the 
protein and receptor, capable of interacting with another FGFR-FGF-2 complex (Figure 
6(d)). There is also the theory that the two binding sites on FGF-2 for FGFR, in the 
presence of HSP, are capable of bridging two FGFRs (Figure 6(e)). Another possibility 
is that two FGF -2 molecules bind individually to 2 FGFRs, with one HSP binding across 
them (Figure 6(f)). 
A relationship between HSP and FGFR in terms of regulating cellular signalling 
has also been demCinstrated; it has been shown that reducing HSPs cell surface 
concentrations can lead to up-regulation of FGFR expression, and vice versa (Padera et 
al. 1999). 
-26­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
The intemali2.ation of the FGF-2 molecule occurs by direct binding either to the 
FGFR, to cell membrane bound HSPs, or to both (Omitz et al. 1992; Schlessinger. 2000; 
Yayon et al. 1991 ). [t is this mechanism, and the presence of HSPs, that determines the 
cellular response (Quarto and Amalric. 1994; Reiland and Rapraeger. 1993). This was 
recently seen in retinal pigment epithelial cells, whereby FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 induced 
different signalling pathways (Rosenthal et al. 2005). Chinese hamster ovary cells 
deficient in HSPs induced a different FGF-2-FGFR-1 signalling pathway compared to 
cultures where hepann sulphate was added (Lundin et al. 2003). This work suggested 
that FGF-2 alone will bind to FGFR-1 with low affinity and in the presence ofHSP binds 
with high affinity. Further studies with smooth muscle cells indicate that FGF-2 induced 
proliferation is independent of FGFR but dependent on HSP mechanisms (Natke et al. 
1999). 
2.4.4 FGF-2- HSF' Interactions in the Wounded Cornea 
FGF-2 has been localized in the cornea, conjuctiva, retina, aqueous humour and 
limbus (Reid. 1994). FGF-2 binds to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the basement 
membrane of the rrurine cornea, and to the basement membrane and Descemet's 
membrane ofthe bovine cornea (Reid. 1994). 
In wound healing, platelets, neutrophils and lymphoma cells can release 
heparanase with can degrade ECM-HSP bonds in Descement's membrane, releasing 
FGF-2 for cell usage (Ishai-Michaeli, Eldor, and Vlodavsky. 1990). Other inflammatory 
cells can release corneal endothelium modulation factor, which in tum can stimulate 
FGF-2 synthesis (Kay, Gu, and Smith. 1994). FGF-2 can then induce wound healing by 
-27­Masters Thes s -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
stimulating epithelial healing, endothelial proliferation, keratocyte migration and 
keratocyte expression of an HSP, keratin sulphate proteoglycan (Hoppenreijs et al. 1994; 
Krachrner, Mannis, and Holland. 2005; Rieck et al. 1994; Zieske. 2001). While HSP is 
not normally expressed in a healthy stroma, upon injury, corneal stormal cells begin to 
express HSPs, and this is believed to greatly influence the wound healing response 
through increased FGF-2 bioavailability and subsequent fibroblast differentiation (Hsia, 
Richardson, and Nug,~nt. 2003; Rapraeger, Krufka, and Olwin. 1991). 
Also of interest is the characterization of the response of cornea stromal 
fibroblasts to low density populations (from 1000 to 35000 cells/cm2) in which cells 
demonstrated increa~;ed FGF-2 binding (Richardson, Trinkaus-Randall, and Nugent. 
1999). This up-regulation could be interpreted as a means of augmenting stromal 
proliferation and migration during wound healing. The nuclear localization and cell 
proliferation of the c~lls was also increased in the presence of FGF-2 and HSPs, when 
cultured on fibronectn, compared to those seeded on collagen type I (Hsia, Richardson, 
and Nugent. 2003). This implies that the wound healing response of fibrin matrix 
production may enhance fibroblast proliferation. Also of importance are the HSP side 
chains that, upon translocation, are cleaved from the protein backbone, but remain bound 
to FGF-2 for its transportation to the cell nucleus. 
2.5 	HEPARIN 
Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan of varying length, with alternating units of 
glucosarnine and iduronic acid that is commonly secreted by mast cells (Faharn, Linhardt, 
and Rees. 1998; Galzie, Kinsella, and Smith. 1997). It is structurally very similar to the 
-28­Masters Thes [s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
side chains of cell membrane heparan sulphate proteoglycans except that it is highly 
sulphated, as seen in Figure 2-6. 
Heparin interacts with a variety of proteins, such as antithrombin and annexin V, 
and is currently used as an anticoagulant and as a coating to create more blood 
compatible anticoagulant surfaces (Brash. 2000; Hinrichs et al. 1997b; Mulloy and 
Linhardt. 2001; Zhou and Meyerhoff. 2005).

2.5.1 Heparin Inte1·actions with FGF-2 and FGFR 
Heparin also has the potential to interact with growth factor molecules, including 
FGF-2, to which it binds with high affinity (Faham, Linhardt, and Rees. 1998). The 
binding affinity of FCrF-2 to heparin increases with increasing chain length, and it is also 
possible to bind more than one FGF molecule to a heparin chain; either in a cis-or trans­
formation or in a way that complements both. 
Heparin has bt:en shown to form tertiary structures with FGF and FGFR, although 
there is some debc.te about the minimum length required for this interaction 
(hexasaccharide vers1: s octasaccharide) (Pellegrini. 2001; Schlessinger. 2000). Current 
models mirror previously mentioned HSP-FGF-2-FGFR interactions. 
-29­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
One thing to note is the effect of heparin dose and application to cells. Low 
heparin concentrations (< 1 ).lg/mL), in the presence of FGF-2, were found to stimulate 
fibroblast proliferation while high concentrations (> 10 ).lg/mL) hindered it (Fannon, 
Forsten, and Nugent. 2000; Skaletz-Rorowski et al. 1996; Yamashita et al. 1992). This 
was further investigcted with corneal stroma cells, where proliferation was hindered at 
heparin concentrations ranging from 200-5000 J..Lg/mL (Denk and Knorr. 1999). 
2.6 ARTIFICIAL CORNEA 
Second only to cataracts, cornea disease, trauma, scarring or ulceration is a major 
cause of vision loss (Whitcher, Srinivasan, and Upadhyay. 2001). Currently, the most 
accepted and successful treatment for cornea blind patients is corneal allograft surgery 
whereby donor tissue is implanted into the host. However there are risks of disease 
transmission and an increasing shortage of donor tissue highly due to the aging 
population and the increasing popularity of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery 
for refractive cornea ~~rrors, which damages the tissue for donation (Carlsson et al. 2003; 
Chirila et al. 1998; Duan, Klenk:ler, and Sheardown. 2006; Griffith et al. 2003). Thus 
there is a need for alternative substitutes, namely keratoprostheses and tissue engineered 
corneal equivalents (Carlsson et al. 2003; Duan, Klenk:ler, and Sheardown. 2006). 
The ideal artificial cornea must be non toxic, transparent with a suitable refractive 
index, have comparable textile strength to the native cornea, interact well with the 
corneal cellular layer~; and nerve network, promote cellular communication, and be able 
to provide the semi-p~~rmeable membrane characteristics of the native cornea for oxygen 
-30­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
and nutrient diffusion (Chirila et al. 1998; Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006; Griffith 
et al. 2003). 
2.7 KERATOPROSTHESES 
There are two main keratoprosthesis designs: the optical stem with skirt implant, 
also referred to as the collar button design, and the core and skirt model (Khan, 
Dudenhoefer, and Dohlman. 2001 ). Both are illustrated in Figure 2-7. A typical collar 
button design has a transparent optical core joined to 2 plates, one anterior and one 
posterior, which sandwich the cornea and anchor the device. The core and skirt 
keratoprosthesis com ists of a transparent, flexible material of suitable optical refraction, 
surrounded by a skirt to anchor or suture the device, to the cornea's stromal intralamellar 
region.

Figure 2-7. The two most common keratoprosthesis designs (Khan, Dudenhoefer, 
and Dohlman. 2001). The button and collar model from the side (a) and from the 
anterior surface (b). The core and skirt model side profile (a) and viewed from 
above (b). 
The optic core must be transparent with similar optical properties to the eye and 
the skirt of the devic{: must be strong enough to withstand placement and suturing. The 
optic stem should be .1s short as possible to avoid anterior chamber penetration (Hicks et 
al. 2000). Keratoprosthesis with porous skirts are being explored, as they potentially 
allow ingrowth of host tissue and permit adequate oxygen and nutrient permeability to 
-31 ­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
integrated cells (Carlsson et al. 2003). The pore should be on the micron range, usually 
between 10 -30 J.lm, and interconnected to ensure cell-cell interactions and ECM 
deposition (Griffith ,~t al. 2003). The anterior surface of the device should encourage 
epithelialization. H::>wever, epithelial downgrowth which commonly leads to device 
extrusion, should be avoided. The posterior surface of the device should inhibit cellular 
integration to maintain device clarity (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). The two 
most successful protc>type devices include the collar button and core and skirt designs. 
2.7.1 Collar Button Keratoprostheses 
The Dohlman-Doane keratoprosthesis device, composed of a poly(methyl 
methacrylate (PMMA) collar-button design, over a clinical seven year study, resulted in 
many corneal complications, including extrusion, inflammation, glaucoma, 
retroprosthetic membrane, retinal detachment and hindered vision (Y aghouti et al. 2001 ). 
However, many of these negative outcomes were attributed to patient preoperative 
conditions, with only non-cicatrizing conditions achieving amicable results. Future work 
with this device focuses on improving device design, surgical procedures, and aligning 
the appropriate postc,perative procedures (anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, contact 
lens bandages, shunts, etc.) with preoperative diagnosis (corneal bums, auto-immune 
diseases, glaucoma, e·:c.) (Aquavella et al. 2005; Subhransu et al. 2002). 
PMMA had also been combined with other polymers in an effort to exploit the 
biointegration or strergth ofthese other polymers. The Seoul-type keratoprosthesis, has a 
stem made of surfac ~ treated PMMA with a flange of fluorinated silicone, a porous 
poly( urethane) or po ypropylene skirt, for fibroblast infiltration, and a polypropylene 
-32­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
haptic, to interact with the sclera, providing the keratoprosthesis double fixed anchoring 
and increased mechanical stability (Kim et al. 2002b). Despite promising preliminary 
animal studies indicating corneal neovascularization, fibroblast integration, collagen 
deposition, no extrm ion with mild tissue necrosis, and decreased inflammation (Kim et 
al. 2002a), human trials were disappointing (Kim et al. 2002b ). Implantation led to skirt 
exposure, irregardle~:s of skirt material, retroprosthetic membrane formation, retinal 
detachment, glaucoma and endophthalmitis, perhaps due to preoperative circumstances. 
2.7.2 Core and Skirt Keratoprostheses 
The AlphaCcr™ keratoprosthesis, previously known as the Chirila KPro, is 
composed of poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA), a flexible, hydrophilic, 
permeable polymer, :hat through curing manipulation with water content, can have an 
interconnecting, non-Jorous and transparent centre and a porous and opaque skirt (Hicks 
et al. 2000). Corneal anchorage through stroma fibroblast integration in animal studies 
was demonstrated w[th this device; however delayed healing, and inflammation did 
occur. Although preliminary human clinical trials with the device have been promising, 
with 80% device retention after one year, complications typical of other keratoprosthetic 
devices, including tisme melting, retroprosthetic membrane formation, optic damage and 
poor biointegration (Hicks et al. 2003) were observed. In some patients, pHEMA 
calcification occurred, which is thought to be due to polymer degradation or protein 
adsorption. Epithelialization of the device's anterior surface did not occur and was 
deemed unnecessary by the research group, as extrusion was not evident (Hicks et al. 
2000); however, it can be argued that an absence of an anterior epithelial layer may 
-33 ­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
increase the chance for bacterial infection and may affect the quality of the tear film 
(Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). Other implantation techniques and device 
designs are being investigated to minimize clinical complications, and improve the 
mechanical strength t)f the polymer, through the use of various crosslinking agents. As 
well, different surface modification techniques have been used to increase hydrophobicity 
and decrease the risk of bacterial adhesion. 
Porous polytetrafluoroethylene ( ePTFE) has been explored as a haptic support, in 
the BIOKOP prostheses, of which there are two prototypes (I and II), type I with a 
PMMA optic core, and type II with one of silicone. BIOKOP I implanted in rabbits 
demonstrated keratocyte migration and collagen production (Legeais et al. 1994). 
However, implantation into humans was not as successful, with glaucoma, necrosis, 
extrusions, endopho1halmitis, retroprosthetic membrane formation and lens dislocation 
(Legeais et al. 1995). It was determined that a PMMA optic core was inappropriate for 
this keratoprosthesis. Further design lead to BIOKOP II with an optic core based on poly 
(dimethyl siloxane) <PDMS) with a polyvinylpyrrolidone coating (Legeais and Renard. 
1998). The PDMS and ePTFE were crosslinked at the optic-skirt interface to overcome 
the issue of compromised strength typically seen at composite keratoprosthetic interfaces 
(Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). Short-term clinical trials showed improved 
results over the previous BIOKOP type with only a few retroprosthetic membranes and 
extractions due to buccal muscal instability as epithelial surface coverage was not evident 
(Legeais and Renard. 1998). However, a recent long-term clinical study of this 
keratoprosthesis in humans, many with preoperative complications, resulted in skirt 
-34­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
exposure, retroprostbetic membranes, endophthalmitis and device extrusion (Alio et al. 
2004). 
2.7.3 Complications and Future Directions 
Synthetic kentoprostheses are advantageous as they could provide off the shelf 
availability, improved optical properties and reduce the risk of disease transmission 
associated with allografts (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006; Griffith et al. 2003). 
Many do not interact well with host tissue resulting in device extrusion, tissue rejection 
(stromal melting and epithelial thinning), aqueous humour leakage, infection, 
retroprosthetic membrane formation, retinal detachment and glaucoma, mainly 
attributable to device rigidity, poor permeability ofnutrients and oxygen (Duan, Klenkler, 
and Sheardown. 20)6; Griffith et al. 2003; Llloyd, Faragher, and Denyer. 2001). 
Composite keratoprostheses generally have compromised mechanical strength at the 
core-skirt interface <Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). Some keratoprosthesis 
demonstrate moderate stromal anchoring; but issues remain with biointegration, primarily 
with the epithelium, and inflammatory reactions, which may be attributable to exposure 
of the device to the tear layer (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006; Griffith et al. 
2003). 
Further modification of devices with extracellular matrix proteins, namely 
collagen, fibronectin and laminin, or with oligopeptides, including cell adhesion peptides 
RGDS, YIGSR, PHSRN and PDSGR has shown increased epithelialization of a 
keratoprosthetic anterior surface in vitro (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006; Griffith 
et al. 2003). Growth factors, specifically epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 
-35­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) have been tethered to polymers to manipulate 
epithelialization. Success was observed with the former material; the latter was 
hypothesized to stimulate stromal migration but was found to be inhibitory in tethered 
form (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). 
Ideally a keratoprosthesis, and the implantation surgery and preoperative 
techniques, would promote a response similar to that seen in wound healing, and not 
induce excessive macrophage activation or foreign body inflammation (Hicks et al. 
2000). 
2.8 POLY (DIMETHYL SILOXANE) 
Poly (dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) elastomer, shown in Figure 2-8, is prepared by 
combining a silicon molecule with alkene groups to a hydrolyzed silicon molecule in the 
presence a catalyst, u:mally platinum (Brook. 2000).

PDMS 
Figure 2-8. The poly (dimethyl siloxane) elastomer chemical composition comprises 
of a silicone core and branched methyl groups (Maciejewski et al. 2006). 
With its tran~:parency, high gas permeability, low toxicity, relative mechanical 
strength, and thermal and oxidative stability, PDMS has been explored for biomedical 
applications (Chen et al. 2005; Liu and Sheardown. 2005; Maciejewski et al. 2006) and 
has been widely used as an ophthalmic biomaterial. However, given the hydrophobic 
-36­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
methyl groups attached to the silicon core, PDMS is susceptible to non-specific protein 
absorption (Bartzokc., McDermott, and Brook. 1999), which is undesirable for many 
biological applications. For example, in blood contacting applications, protein adsorption 
may lead to coagulation, complement activation, thrombosis and haemolytic damage 
(Brash. 2000). While contact lenses based on silicone rubber have recently seen great 
success, they are pmne to tear protein and lipid adsorption leading to lens fouling and 
patient discomfort (lloyd, Faragher, and Denyer. 2001). In artificial cornea, PDMS has 
shown low epithelial cell adhesion in vitro (Aucoin et al. 2002). Therefore, to improve 
these properties, vari1)US modification techniques have been used. 
PDMS modified via microwave frequency plasma polymerization with allyl 
alcohol to create reactive hydroxyl groups, which, after a series of subsequent reactions, 
allowed for synergistic peptide immobilization of laminin and fibronectin derivatives, 
namely YIGSR, RGDS, PDSGR and PHSRN, and improved corneal epithelial cell 
attachment in vitro (Aucoin et al. 2002). This technique was also applied to PDMS 
surfaces for the t1!thering of a bifunctional poly (ethylene glycol) spacer for 
immobilization of 1ransforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF-~2) to impede corneal 
epithelial cell adhesiJn (Merrett et al. 2003). While, as noted above, the in vitro results 
were somewhat unexpected, the potential for modification of PDMS in this manner was 
clear. 
Alternatively. modification with poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO), a highly 
hydrophilic, non-toxic and non-immunogenic polymer, to minimize hydrophobicity as 
well as related protein adsorption (Chen et al. 2005b; Kingshott, Thissen, and Griesser. 
-37­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
2002) and cell adhesion (Chen et al. 2006; Llanos and Sefton. 1993; Shen et al. 2002) has 
been investigated. Block copolymers ofPDMS, PEO and heparin, developed in 1988 for 
anti-thrombogenic applications, demonstrated a heterogeneous microphase-separated 
structure that reorgarized the immobilized heparin to its surface upon hydration, with the 
heparin molecule keeping its biological activity. Biologically these materials showed low 
levels of platelet activation, (Grainger et al. 1990a; Grainger et al. 1990b; Grainger, Kim, 
and Feijen. 1988). 
2.8.1 Polysiloxane Keratoprosthesis 
Polysiloxane~ were successfully tested for biocompatibility in animal eyes by 
Lieb et. al. in 1959, and later unsuccessfully as canine corneal intralamellar disks by 
Bowen et al. in the 1960s (Chirila et al. 1998). Some success was achieved later by 
Dohlman et al. to implant silicone into the corneal stroma of edema patients, which later 
evolved to an artific.al corneal endothelium (Brown and Dohlman. 1965; Dohlman and 
Dube. 1968). Silicone keratoprosthesis subsequently appeared in the 1970s by 
Ruedemann et al. in the shape of a saucer or satellite, with a supporting perforated plate 
or a Dacron® cloth skirt flange (Chirila et al. 1998; Reudemann. 1974). Human 
implantation of the device over a 10 year period was promising given its infancy, with 
short-term success in some patients; however long-term success was not achieved with 
many complications rrising. 
Recently the use of silicone rubber in keratoprosthesis applications has been 
reprised (Lee et al. 1 :)96). In an effort to create a more corneal cell compatible surface, a 
homobifunctional pHEMA film was deposited on the silicone surface, via plasma 
-38­Masters Thes $ -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
induced graft polymerization. Epithelial coverage was observed in vitro and in vivo 
although there was evidence of epithelial downgrowth and device clarity was 
compromised with ct:rtain pHEMA concentrations. To prevent epithelial downgrowth, a 
heterobifunctional silicone surface was created with pHEMA or collagen on the anterior 
surface for epithelial growth, and either 2-methacryloyloxethyl phosphorylcholine or 
bisamino polyethylene oxide on the posterior side for epithelial inhibition (Chang, Lee, 
and Hsiue. 1998). In vitro and in vivo results with the collagen surface in particular were 
encouraging, with only slight complications (opacity and neovascularization). However, 
there have been no re :::ent results with this system. 
The Aachen keratoprosthesis, first mentioned in 2000, is entirely composed of 
transparent silicone rubber, with a aspheric optical centre, a haptic suturing section and 
protruding arms for scleral suturing later to be covered by the conjunctiva (Langefeld et 
al. 2000). Designed primarily for short applications during vitrectomy, in vivo 
implantation resulted in edema in some cases but generally the eyes maintained retinal 
attachment. While promising, there were issues with host compatibility, including cell 
integration, which mt st be addressed. 
Plasma polymerization of PDMS with allyl amine and subsequent 
functionalization of PEO with tethered epidermal growth factor (EGF), for the use as the 
anterior surface of a keratroprosthesis, was found to significantly improve corneal 
epithelization in vitro (Klenkler and Sheardown. 2006; Klenkler et al. 2005). 
More recentl) PDMS and PEO were combined during the room temperature 
vulcanization process to form bulk polymers with reduced protein adsorption (Chen et al. 
-39­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
2005; Chen, Brook, and Sheardown. 2004). Using a novel method, PEO modified 
PDMS surfaces have been generated by first creating a reactive Si-H layer through acid 
catalyzed equilibration with a polymethylhydrogen siloxane fluid (MeHSiO)n, DC1107, 
and subsequent hydrosilylation with allyl terminated PEO (Figure 2-9) (Chen et al. 
2005b).

acid (F3CS03H), fot·ms surface Si-H functionalization, which can further react, in 
the presence of platinum, via hydrosilylation, with allyl terminated PEO (Chen et al. 
2005b). 
By using a teterobifunctional PEO molecule, various biological components, 
including cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, and heparin could be immobilized on 
the PDMS substrate, resulting in high biological specificity (Chen et al. 2005a; Chen et 
al. 2006). 
The high hydrophobicity of PDMS would be expected to impact its performance 
in vivo, as it lacks the appropriate glucose permeability necessary for cell survival (Liu 
and Sheardown. 200::). Therefore, a composite interpenetrating network of PDMS and 
poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAAM) has been created. The IPN demonstrated

appropriate oxygen and glucose permeability, improved hydrophilicity, and greater 
mechanical strength than control PDMS homopolymers. 
2.9 COLLAGEN 
Collagen is one of the most abundant proteins m the body, mediating cell 
adhesion through interactions with over 50 molecules, namely glycosaminoglycans, 
proteins and growth factors (Friess. 1998; Salchert et al. 2004). It consists of at least 
1000 amino acids, arranged into three polypeptide chains, stabilized by the steric 
repulsion of proline and hydroxyproline residues' pyrrolidine rings, which fold into a 
triple helix configuration via hydrogen bonding. Every third residue is glycine, which 
gives collagen its tight helix formation and tertiary structure. There is a high percentage 
of proline, compared to other proteins, as well as rare amino acids, such as 
hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, the latter of which allows sugar attachment to the 
collagen molecule (Friess. 1998). At either end of the collagen structure, there exists 
amino acids not in the helical formation, termed telopeptides, which are involved in fibril 
crosslinking. 
2.9.1 Natural Colbtgen Crosslinking 
In vivo collagen is crosslinked via intra-and intermolecular bonds. 
Intramolecular thermal crosslinking is initially regulated by lysyl oxidase (also called 
protein lysine 6-oxidase) where, in telopeptide regions, lysine and hydroxylysine residues 
are selectively convetted to allysine and hydroxyallysine (Figure 2-10(a)) (Friess. 1998). 
Allysine and hydroxyallysine are very reactive aldehydes that can form crosslinks, via 
-41 ­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
aldol condensation (Figure 2-10(b)), between two a-chains in the telopeptide regions of 
the same collagen molecule. Aldol condensation initiates with the first aldehyde, in the 
presence of a base, b·~coming an enolate ion that can react with the carbonyl group of the 
second aldehyde mol,~cule (Friess. 1998; Solomons. 1996). 
Intermolecular crosslinking, between the helical region of a quarterly staggered 
collagen molecule and the telopeptide region of an adjacent collagen molecule, occurs 
between aldehyde re ;;idues and E-amino groups from either lysine or hydroxy lysine via 
aldimine formation (Figure 2-10(c)) (Friess. 1998; Solomons. 1996). Further reactions 
occur to form polyfi.:nctional crosslinks with histidine, lysine or hydroxylysine through 
additional condensations (Friess. 1998). Fibril formation is believed to be driven by 
hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Rosenblatt, Devereux, and Wallace. 1993; 
Salchert et al. 2004; Wallace. 1990). Extraction of collagen involves breaking these 
natural crosslinks resulting in a material that, for use in biomaterials and tissue 
engineering applicati:ms, requires external crosslinking. However, thermally crosslinked 
collagen, in which the collagen fibrils reassociate under elevated temperature conditions, 
is generally very weak (Duan and Sheardown. 2006b) and upon in vivo implantation, it 
has a high enzymatic turnover rate (Olde Damink et al. 1996). Thus techniques are 
needed to increase the mechanical and biological stability of crosslinked collagen gels, 
while remaining biccompatible. Various crosslinking agents are being explored to 
enhance collagen ge 1 matrices, such as carbodiimide, gluteraldehyde, hexamethylene 
diisocyanate and acyl azide.

Figure 2-10. Intramolecular and intermolecular collagen crosslinking mechanisms 
(Friess. 1998; Solomons. 1996). Intramolecular crosslinking begins with an 
enzymatic reaction (a), whereby lysine and hydroxylysine are converted to the 
aldehydes allysine and hydroxyallysine. Next two aldehydes of the same collagen 
molecule undergo aldol condensation (b), whereby the first aldehyde is converted to 
an enolate ion that can react with the carbonyl group of the second aldehyde 
molecule. Intermolti!cular crosslinking occurs when aldehyde residues combine with 
amino groups on ly~ine or hydroxylysine to form aldimine crosslinks (c). 
2.9.2 	 Chemical Crosslinking of Collagen with Carbodiimide 
Chemical crosslinking collagen with carbodiimides, such as 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethyl 
aminopropyl) carbocliimide (EDC), induces isopeptide bonds. More specifically, the 
EDC reacts with the carboxyl group of glutamic acid or aspartic acid on the collagen 
chain (Figure 2-11) (Grabarek and Gergely. 1990; Wissink, M. J. B. et al. 2001), forming 
an unstable and high:y reactive 0-acylisourea ester, which can react with an amine group 
on lysine, creating a :;table amide bond. However, the intermediate 0-acylisourea ester is 
-43­Masters Thes .s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
highly susceptible to hydrolysis, which can lead to the regeneration of the carboxylate 
molecule and no subsequent crosslinking (Grabarek and Gergely. 1990; Olde Damink et 
al. 1996). To improve EDC mediated reactions, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) is added, 
as it can react with the 0-acylisourea ester, creating a semi-stable amine reactive 
succinimidyl ester. This NBS-ester has a slower hydrolytic rate and can further be 
modified to create the stable amide bond (Grabarek and Gergely. 1990).

Carbodiimide crosslinking is "zero-length", as direct covalent crosslinks between 
collagen are formed (Grabarek and Gergely. 1990). EDC/NHS therefore merely acts as a 
crosslinking catalyst that is washed away after crosslinking occurs. This zero-length 
crosslinking is limit,~d by the number of amine groups available within the collagen 
molecule, typically :10 per 1000 (or with incomplete amine hydrolysis, 75 per 1000), 
compared to the 120 per 1000 carboxylic acid groups (Duan and Sheardown. 2005). It is 
also likely that not all carboxylic acid groups are activated by EDC, further decreasing 
crosslinking density. As such, collagen matrices fabricated in this manner often lack the 
desired strength required for tissue engineering constructs. Collagen crosslinked via 
EDC/NHS has however been shown to be non-toxic in vitro and in vivo (Wissink, M. J. 
B. et al. 2001). 
2.10 DENDRIMERS 
Dendrimers are multivalent, globular molecules whose core is linked to many 
branches, usually fabricated with reactive groups able to covalently attach molecules for 
drug delivery (Boas md Heegaard. 2004; Gillies and Frechet. 2005). Molecular weight 
can also be manipulated by adding additional cascaded branches, or generations (Boas 
and Heegaard. 2004 ). Two of the more common dendrimers are polyamido amine 
(P AMAM) and po .ypropyleneimine (PPI) dendrimers. The latter has a 1,4­
diaminobutane core ;md reactive amine branches, as shown in Figure 2-12 (Gillies and 
Frechet. 2005).

Figure 2-12. Gent~ration two (G2) polypropylene Imme dendrimer, with a 1,4 
diaminobutane core and amine branches (Gillies and Frechet. 2005). 
Of concern is the cationic nature of P AMAM and PPI animo-terminated branches, 
as in vitro studies have shown cellular toxicity through binding of the dendrimer to the 
cellular membrane, resulting in membrane damage and eventual lysis. However, lower 
generation dendrimers, and those surface modified with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), or 
complexed with oglionucleotides have been shown to have reduced cytotoxicity (Boas 
and Heegaard. 2004). Conversely, in vivo studies, with injected cationic PAMAM 
dendrimers, failed to ~how significant toxicity or immunogenicity in mice, although there 
is the risk of liver accumulation (Boas and Heegaard. 2004; Gillies and Frechet. 2005). 
Currently various dendrimers are being exploited for drug delivery of anticancer drugs, 
gene delivery through DNA coupling, although targeting, systemic half-life and toxicity 
remain ongoing issue~; (Gillies and Frechet. 2005). 
2.11 TISSUE ENGINEERED CORNEAL IMPLANTS 
Tissue-engineered cornea equivalents consist of cell based repair strategies, either 
using immortalized cdls lines of primary/low passage limbal of central cornea cells, that 
-46­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
also incorporate extra cellular matrix components, particularly collagen as over 85% of 
the cornea is Type I collagen (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). Several groups 
have developed collagen based materials for use as tissue engineered corneal matrices. 
2.11.1 Collagen Based Corneal Implants 
A 3-D collagen thermogel, has been developed by the Laboratoire 
d'Organogenese Experimentale (LOEX) group, using a sandwich approach (Carlsson et 
al. 2003; Duan, Klender, and Sheardown. 2006). First, corneal fibroblasts are cultured to 
produce a collagenous extracellular matrix. These sheets are subsequently layered into a 
3-D matrix, after which epithelial cells are seeded on top to create an environment similar 
to the natural cornea (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). There are issues with the 
matrix strength, but filter paper anchorage rings have been explored for matrix stability 
(Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006). 
In another model, a lyophilized, dehydrothermally crosslinked collagen sponge 
matrix, with controll1~d porosity, and strength, has shown to support epithelial, keratocyte 
and endothelial cell migration and proliferation and extracellular matrix production in 
vitro (Orwin and Hubel. 2000). Characterization of the sponge matrices revealed a 
stronger modulus wren seeded with keratocytes than collagen gels, although it remained 
lower than the native cornea. Transparency was adequate with keratocyte seeded 
sponges and was fUJther enhanced with the addition of proteoglycans (Orwin, Borene, 
and Hubel. 2003). There was also evidence of sponge contraction, caused by fibroblast 
differentiation into myofibroblasts and subsequent matrix remodelling. Water 
permeability studies indicated that permeability fluctuated with time and the structure 
-47­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
was not on par with the permeability of the native cornea (Borene, Barocas, and Rubel. 
2004). 
Collagen containing chondroitin-6-sulfate crosslinked with glutaraldehyde 
resulted in gels with increased transparency and strength, compared to thermally 
crosslinked collagen (Doillon et al. 2003). In vitro, in the presence of protease inhibitors 
and ascorbic acid to hinder matrix degradation and promote collagen synthesis, the 
surfaces were compatible with immortalized corneal cell lines and promoted keratocyte 
ion channel development (Griffith et al. 1999). However, there are concerns over the 
biostability and cytotoxicity of glutaraldehyde crosslinked collagen (Duan and 
Sheardown. 2005). Further experimentation led to the development of a collagen 
crosslinked with a N-isopropylacrylamide, acrylic acid and acryloxysuccinamide 
copolymer that had superior transparency, tensile strength and reactive functional groups 
for the integration of additional molecules, such as extracellular matrix components and 
growth factors (Li e1 al. 2005). In vivo, these surfaces promoted epithelial overgrowth, 
stromal ingrowth, a1d nerve regeneration without excessive inflan1mation (Li et al. 
2003). 
2.11.2 Collagen Crosslinked with Dendrimers 
As an alternative method of generating corneal tissue engineering scaffolds, the 
amme groups of collagen were amplified using polypropyleneimine octaamine 
dendrimers with EDC/NHS for collagen crosslinking (Duan and Sheardown. 2005). 
Compared with thermal and chemical crosslinkers including EDC/NHS and 
glutaraldehyde, dendrimer crosslinked collagen showed high mechanical strength, good 
-48­Masters Thesi s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
optical clarity, biological stability and high crosslinking density (Duan and Sheardown. 
2005; Duan and S1eardown. 2006b) and the potential to add further biological 
functionalization through free reactive groups on the dendrimer (Duan et al. 2006a 
(Ahead ofprint)). 
Preliminary cytotoxicity of dendrimer crosslinked collagen was evaluated in vitro 
with corneal epithelial cells, to which positive biocompatibility results were obtained, yet 
there exists a need for extensive cellular studies to assess protein production and 
mitochondrial activity (Duan and Sheardown. 2006b ). 
2.12 GROWTH FACTOR DELIVERY SYSTEMS 
Drug delivery systems for bioactive factors, such as growth factors and cytokines, 
have been widely explored for the targeting of tissue restoration, maintenance, structure 
and function, through an artificial environment to stimulate desired cellular activities 
(Lutolf and Hubbell. 2005; Saltzman and Olbricht. 2002). Of concern are the 
administration route, drug release profile, delivery method, targeting and fabrication of 
the delivery vehicle (Sinha and Trehan. 2003). Also, the biophysical, biochemical, and 
physiological charactt:ristics of the growth factor as well as its molecular size, biological 
half-life, and the dose requirements need to be considered in the design of an effective 
delivery system. The amount of growth factor released is crucial. There must be an 
adequate amount pre.;;ent to stimulate the desired physiological response of the cells; 
however, it should not be present in an amount such that it stimulates receptor down 
regulation, whereby cells decrease the number growth factor receptors, diluting the 
desired biological re~:ponse (Nimni. 1997). Maintenance of growth factor biological 
-49­Masters Thes [s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
activity during manufacturing and release is also crucial (Tabata. 2003). Degraded 
protein may cause immunogenic responses that could compromise the integrity of the 
delivery system, potentially altering the release profile and bioactivity (Sinha and Trehan. 
2003). 
2.12.1 Insoluble Growth Factor Delivery 
Typically the time needed to generate a cell response is longer than the half life of 
the growth factor (Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998; Lee. 2000). Therefore, parenteral 
delivery, via intraven::ms of intramuscular injection, of growth factors is not an effective 
delivery method as growth factors rapidly disperse from the injection site and are prone 
to proteolysis (Tabatz .. 2003). For example, rapid degradation and loss of bioactivity of 
FGF-2 has been noted when it has been injected or ingested (Saltzman and Baldwin. 
1998; Lee. 2000). To maintain growth factor concentrations in the therapeutic range, 
high doses and frequent injections are necessary, which can increase side effects and 
perhaps lead to undt::sirable cellular responses (Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998). Oral 
delivery of proteins is hindered by the intestinal lumen, a poorly permeable interface 
through which the d ~ug must pass to be effective, and by the many pro teases and 
peptidases that line its structure, which can denature the protein (Sinha and Trehan. 
2003). Another risk with systematic delivery systems lies with the pluripotency of 
growth factors, as it may be desired to influence only one population of cells and not 
another (Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998). 
Therefore, localized controlled delivery systems are widely investigated for 
growth factor delivery, whereby the drug is incorporated by some means into a polymer 
-50­Masters ThesJs -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
or hydrogel carrier (Babensee, Mcintire, and Mikos. 2000; Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998). 
The drug release usually occurs via diffusion, although it can be affected by material 
characteristics (degradable or non-degradable) and shape (reservoir or matrix), and the 
amount of drug loaded. The most common systems include reservoir devices, poly­
dispersed matrices, microspheres and hydrogels as shown in Figure 2-13.

Figure 2-13. Localized and controlled delivery systems for protein delivery 
(Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998). Reservoir systems have the growth factor contained 
in its core, whereby the release is controlled by diffusion. Degradable or non­
degradable dispers,ed systems have the growth factor suspended throughout the 
matrix. Hydrogel aystems hold the growth factor within its crosslinks, which can 
degrade, releasing the growth factor, or the matrix can swell allowing for drug 
diffusion. Microspheric systems encapsulate the growth factor within multiple non­
degradable or degradable microspheres that release the growth factor. 
. 51 ­Masters Thes [s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
Reservoir sy~:tems have the growth factor surrounded by a polymer coating; 
however the large si2:e of growth factors greatly reduces their diffusion from the material 
and there are incidences of dose-dumping, whereby damage to the polymer coating is 
followed by massiw protein release (Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998). Alternatively, 
polymer matrices containing dispersed growth factor have favourable release, as they are 
capable of slowly delivering macromolecules. Hydrogel delivery systems have also been 
widely examined for protein release, although the kinetics of release from hydrogels are 
not optimal. Microspheres encapsulating growth factors protect the protein from 
degradation and rapid clearance in vivo (Sinha and Trehan. 2003). If degradable, the 
microspheres do not require removal; however given their small size and dispersement, 
premature termination of the treatment is a common challenge as they are difficult to 
locate and remove (Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998). 
2.12.1.1 Insoluble FGF -2 Delivery 
Although insoluble delivery of pharmaceutical drugs is promlSlng, FGF-2 
delivery with this method has encountered much difficulty. Table 2-3 lists polymer and 
hydrogel systems tha: have been used to deliver FGF-2 and the associated drawbacks of 
those systems.

Release from many of these systems is diffusion controlled, which may result in 
rapid release kinetics in the absence of an alternative controlling technique (Tabata. 
2000). Ideally it would be desirable to deliver the protein at a rate that is proportional to 
the rate of site elimination (Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998). Unbound FGF-2 has a short 
half life, as it is prone to rapid enzymatic degradation (Saksela et al. 1988), resulting in a 
circulation clearance time of only 1.5 minutes when administered intravenously in rats 
(Whalen, Shing, and Folkman. 1989). Therefore it is desired to deliver the growth factor 
using an alternative method, either through tethering or via soluble delivery systems. 
2.12.2 Immobilized Growth Factor Delivery 
Growth factors can be covalently conjugated to carrier polymers or proteins for 
sustained localized delivery (Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998). The conformation of the 
-53­Masters Thes' s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
attached growth fact,:>r is of critical importance, to maintain its biological activity, but 
resist receptor internalization for sustained signaling. As well, alteration or denaturation 
ofthe protein may lead to inflammation (Brevig et al. 2005). 
Growth factors immobilized to surfaces have shown to increase cell stimulation 
and surface receptor population, compared to free or adsorbed growth factors in vitro 
(DeLong, Moon, and West. 2005; Gomez et al. 2006 (in press); Nimni. 1997). A variety 
of growth factors including EGF (Klenkler and Sheardown. 2006; Klenkler et al. 2005) 
and TGF-P (Merret1 et al. 2003) have been covalently attached, including FGF-2, 
whereby it was complexed to biotin and tethered to biotinylated collagen via avidin­
biotin interactions (S1ompro, Hansbrough, and Boyce. 1989). 
Typically immobilized growth factor systems are used to create biologically 
active surfaces for cellular stimulation and adhesion. Conjugated growth factors in some 
cases have demonstrated increased stability and failed to aggravate immunogenic 
responses (Saltzman and Baldwin. 1998). It may be difficult to utilize this delivery 
method for cellular responses that require internalization of the growth factor, if it 
remains tethered to the surface. However, removed from the delivery vehicle, the growth 
factor is still susceptible to enzymatic degradation and rapid clearance. 
2.12.3 Soluble Growth Factor Delivery 
Stabilizing agents are frequently added to stabilize the protein, protecting against 
proteolytic cleavage or maintaining bioactivity, either during fabrication, storage or 
delivery. These stabilizing agents can consist of other proteins, sugars, polyols, amino 
acids, chelating agents or inorganic salts (Sinha and Trehan. 2003). Additionally, 
-54­Masters Thes [s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
stabilizing agents can also be used to decrease the protein release rate (Saltzman and 
Baldwin. 1998). 
2.12.3.1 Soluble FGF-2 Delivery with Heparin 
Binding of FGF-2 to heparin allows FGF-2 to be delivered in soluble form 
without degradation, as heparin has been shown to stabilize acidic and basic fibroblast 
growth factor over a high temperature range (Sinha and Trehan. 2003). For instance, 
when FGF-2 and heparin have been combined in an intravenous solution administered 
continuously to rats, growth factor circulation time increased 3 fold, and systemic 
concentrations were maintained at higher levels than when FGF -2 was delivered alone 
(Whalen, Shing, and Folkman. 1989). FGF-2 delivery systems with heparin have shown 
to prolong growth factor release (Sakiyama-Elbert and Hubbell. 2000), and prolonged 
storage and encapsulation of FGF-2 has been achieved through its binding to heparin­
sepharose beads (Lee. 2000). Also, heparin added to the release medium has been shown 
to increase FGF-2 release (Liu et al. 2002), presumably aiding in the translocation of 
FGF-2 from the delivery system. Thus, FGF-2 delivery with heparin is amicable for 
sustained FGF-2 stability and bioactivity; a few research examples are highlighted in 
Table 2-4.

3. SCOPE OF PROJECT 
For the succ~ss of an artificial cornea, material modification is required to 
enhance tissue integration including anterior epithelialization, stromal ingrowth and 
anchoring and nerve regeneration. Modification techniques include creating an 
environment that stimulates cell adhesion by introducing cell adhesion molecules and 
tethering growth factors for cell migration and proliferation. Previous studies have 
investigated epithelial coverage and downgrowth inhibition with epidermal growth factor 
(EGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-~), respectively. Stromal anchoring has 
been improved by creating porous matrices that allow fibroblast migration. However, 
direct stimulation ofthe stroma with growth factors has not been addressed. 
Basic fibroblc:.st growth factor (FGF-2) has been shown to be a key modulator of 
stromal wound healing, through its effects on proliferation and migration of various cell 
types. In the cornea, FGF-2 is expressed in the epithelial basement membrane. Upon 
damage, it is released from the extracellular matrix and has been shown to stimulate 
fibroblast proliferation and migration. As well, it may be involved in nerve regeneration. 
Many growth delivery systems lack the ability to protect growth factors from 
proteolytic cleavage and degradation for improved bioavailability and long-term healing. 
Growth factor storage and protection in vivo is mediated by association with extracellular 
matrix glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPs). HSPs have 
been shown to improve FGF-2 stability by protecting it from proteolytic cleavage, and 
heat damage, while curing wound healing, HSPs release FGF-2 for cellular stimulation, 
and have aided in its ·:ranslocation for cellular signaling. 
-58­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
In this study we investigate the heparin modification of two materials, intended 
for use in keratoprostheses and tissue engineered corneal equivalents as a stromal 
stimulant for device anchorage through fibroblast integration. Through the 
immobilization ofheJarin and uptake and release of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF­
2), it is hypothesized that the materials will better mimic the soluble delivery of the 
growth factor that is often seen in wound healing. 
The first material selected was poly (dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS), which has been 
proposed by the Sheardown group as a potential substrate material for an artificial cornea. 
While material mod [fications will be needed to improve glucose and low molecular 
weight permeability, proof of concept was examined with PDMS only. The modified 
material was characterized by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared 
spectrophotometry (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and water 
contact angles. The amount of immobilized heparin and its biological activity were 
quantified. 
The second material selected was dendrimer crosslinked collagen, under 
investigation as a ccrneal tissue engineering scaffold. Heparin incorporation into the 
collagen scaffolds was characterized by water uptake, and differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC), while matrix stability was assessed using colorimetric assays. 
Both material; were exposed to radio labeled FGF -2. The amount of immobilized 
growth factor was quantified. Release under physiological conditions was assessed to 
assess the potential of these materials for growth factor delivery.

4.2 POLY (DIMETHYL SILOXANE) PREPARATION 
Poly (dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) surfaces were fabricated according to 
manufacturer's instmctions. Briefly, Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer base and its curing 
agent were well mixed in a 10:1 w/w ratio in a 10 mm Petri dish (4 g base: 0.4 g curing 
agent). The resulting film was degassed under vacuum for 1 hour, and then allowed to 
cure at room temperature for 5 days. The film was punched into 0.625 em (W') discs, 
with an approximate 0.5 mm thickness, and washed with anhydrous methanol prior to 
use. 
Figure 4-1 illustrates PDMS fabrication and subsequent PDMS surface 
modification reactions. 
4.2.1 PDMS Modification 
PDMS surfaces were first modified to obtain a surface oriented functionalized 
reactive Si-H group, based on the methods described by Chen et a!. (Chen et al. 2005a; 
Chen et al. 2006). Thirty PDMS discs were placed in a 10 dram glass vial and immersed 
in a mixture of 5 mL anhydrous methanol, 3 mL polymethylhydrogen siloxane fluid (DC 
1107), and 50 f.!L of triflic acid [CFS03H]. The vial was shaken vigorously for 30 
minutes at room temperature. Discs were then washed with anhydrous methanol, to 
remove the triflic acid, followed by washing with dried n-hexane, to remove any residual 
DC 1107. Each Si-H modified disc, PDMS-SiH, was dried under N2 and placed under 
high vacuum for at least 8 hrs. Two methods were subsequently used to tether N­
succinimidyl carbonate (NSC) terminal poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) groups to the 
-61 ­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
PDMS-SiH functionalized surface: a direct grafting method and an indirect grafting 
method. 
4.2.2 Direct Graft1ing Method 
Twenty PDMS-SiH functionalized surfaces were placed in a 10 dram glass vial 
with 3 mL of molecular sieve dried 2-methoxyethyl ether, 0.6 g allyl-PEO-NSC and 20 
~-tL of Karstedt's platinum catalyst [(Pt)z(HzC=CH-SiMezOSiMezCH=CHz)3]. The vial 
was purged with N2, tightly sealed, placed in a 50°C oil bath and stirred for 15-20 hrs. 
The resulting surfaces, PDMS-PEO-NSC, were washed with dried acetone, dried with Nz 
and placed in a desiccator for 12 or more hrs. Control hydroxyl-terminated surfaces 
(PDMS-PEO-OH) were prepared by submersing the PDMS-PEO-NSC surfaces in 
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) for 3 days, then washing with Milli-Q water and 
wicking dry. 
4.2.3 Indirect Gra:fting Method 
In a 10 dram glass vial, 10 PDMS-SiH surfaces were immersed in 1 mL 2­
methoxyethyl ether and 1 mL allyl-PEO-OH and catalyzed with 15 ~-tL Karstedt's 
platinum. The vial was gently shaken on an orbital shaker for 2 hrs, after which surfaces 
(PDMS-PEO-OH) wt:re rinsed with acetone, dried with N2 and desiccated for 10 hrs. 
Afterwards, in a 10 dram glass vial, 0.6 g diNHS was dissolved in 1 mL 
anhydrous acetonitrile and 100 ~-tL triethylamine (TEA) for 10 minutes. Ten PDMS­
PEO-OH surfaces were added, purged with N2 and gently shaken on an orbital shaker for 
-62­Masters Thes [s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
6 hrs. Then surface~: were rinsed with anhydrous acetonitrile and 2-methoxyethyl ether,

4.2.4 	 Heparinizati[)n of PDMS Surfaces 
To create heparinized surfaces, PDMS-PEO-NSC surfaces, generated using both 
direct and indirect methods, were immersed in 5 mL of a 10 mg/mL heparin solution in 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 8.0) for at least 6 hrs. Surfaces were then removed, 
rinsed with PBS, and wicked dry. Surfaces were also modified with low molecular 
weight heparin (LM\VH) in a similar manner. 
4.3 	 PDMS SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION 
Surface characterization was performed on PDMS based surfaces via attenuated 
total reflection fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR-ATR), X-ray 
photoelectron spectr,)scopy (XPS), and water contact angles. Heparinization of the 
surfaces was quantifi ~d via colorimetry and biological activity assays. 
4.3.1 Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer 
(ATR-FTIR) 
Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (ATR­
FTIR) provides transmittance spectra correlating to atomic and molecular unit vibrations 
resulting from exposure to infrared radiation and total internal reflection (Merrett et al. 
2002; Ratner et al. 1996). Given two materials with different indices of refraction, the 
infrared beam is restricted to analyzing the surface of a sample, with a penetration depth 
usually on the order of 1-5 J.lm (Merrett et al. 2002; Ratner et al. 1996). A Bio Rad FTS­
40 FTIR equipped with a DTGS detector and a vertical ATR module, with a zinc selenide 
crystal, was used to scan PDMS, PDMS reaction intermediates and the final PDMS-PEO-
Heparin surfaces to v~rify surface reactions. 
-64­Masters Thes [s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
4.3.2 	 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), also referred to as electron spectroscopy 
for chemical analysi:; (ESCA), is utilized for elemental surface quantification (Ratner et 
al. 1996). Infrared X-rays are sent to the surface, causing the emission ofphotoelectrons, 
whose energy is qumtified and translated to binding energy. Binding energies (Es), 
which are character[stic to each element and its environment, are quantified by the 
following equation: 
Es = hu + EK + <D 	 (Eq.l) 
Where: hu =photon energy (energy from the X-ray) 
EK = kinetic energy (of emitted electron) 
<D = work function 
This method can identify all elements, except hydrogen and helium, in quantities 
greater than 0.1 atomic percent. The depth of analysis can range from 10-250 A, with a 
spacial resolution between 10-150 J.lm. 
XPS was performed at Surface Interface Ontario, University of Toronto, using a 
Ley bold (Specs) MAX 200, and peaks were analyzed with the corresponding software. 
A sampling depth of 10 nm was performed for low resolution and high resolution spectra, 
at take off angles of:W0 and 90°. 
4.3.3 	 Water Contnct Angles 
Water contact angles are used to estimate surface energy through the liquid 
wetting of a surface and the surface tension that results (Ratner et al. 1996). The energy 
of the surface (Ysv) can be related to the drop's liquid-vapour surface tension (Ylv) and the 
-65­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
interfacial tension bt::tween the solid and the drop (rs1), combined with the contact angle 
(8). This is illustrate:! in Figure 4-2 and in the following equation: 
'Ysv = 'Ysl +'Yiv cos e (Eq.2) 
Figure 4-2. Contact angle measurements using the sessile drop method. 
In the current work, contact angles were used to monitor surface wettability 
changes with PDMS surface modification. Advancing and receding sessile drop contact 
angles were measun:d on a bench top goniometer (NRL C.A. Goniometer, Rame-hart, 
USA). Milli-Q water was used with a drop volume of 20 f.lL. Contact angles were 
performed in triplicate on each side ofthe surface. 
4.3.4 Heparin Density 
Heparin densty on the PDMS-PEO-Heparin surfaces was quantified via a slightly 
adapted version ofthe toluidine blue assay (Hinrichs et al. 1997a). Briefly, surfaces were 
exposed to a 0.5% toluidine blue solution (with 0.2% sodium chloride (NaCl) and 0.01 N 
hydrochloric acid (HCl)) overnight. Subsequently, surfaces were rinsed 3 times in Milli­
Q water, dabbed dr:r and placed in 700 f.lL of 4:1 ethanol: 0.1 N sodium hydroxide 
(NaOH) solution ovt::might. Surfaces were subsequently removed from the solution and 
the absorbance of 1he ethanol solution read at 540 nm. Absorbance values were 
standardized against standard heparin solutions. Standards were created by exposing 
known concentrations of dissolved heparin in PBS (pH 7.4) to 0.5% toluidine blue 
-66­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
solution (0.2% NaCl and 0.01 N HCl) overnight, after which a precipitate forms. 
Standards were then centrifuged (Allegra X-12R Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter) at 1000g 
for 10 min and the supernatant carefully removed. The pellet was resuspended in a 4:1 
ethanol: 0.1 N NaOH solution, diluted to appropriate concentrations, and read at 540 nm. 
4.3.5 	 Heparin Activity 
As an altern:ttive means to quantify heparin immobilization, its activity was 
assessed by exploiting its involvement with antithrombin III and factor Xa (Ingber. 1991; 
Teien and Lie. 1977), with an anti-Factor Xa assay kit (Stachrom® Heparin, Diagnostica 
Stago, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, surfaces were 
exposed to 100 J..LL purified bovine antithrombin III (AT-III) and either 800 J..LL for 
unfractionated heparin, or 1mL for LMWH, 0.1N tris (hydroxymethyl) methylamine and 
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (TRIS-EDTA) buffer (pH 8.4) for 2 min at 37°C. Then, 
surfaces and 200 J..LL of the AT-III solution were transferred to a new test tube, and 200 
J..LL purified bovine fi1ctor Xa was added and the samples were incubated for 30 seconds 
at 37°C. Next, 200 J..LL of the chromogenic substrate (CBS 31.39) was added, the samples 
incubated for an addtional 30 sec at 37°C and the reaction terminated with the addition 
of 200 J..LL of glacial acetic acid. Surfaces were removed and the solutions read at 540 
nm. Calibration ,:;urves were created with known concentrations of aqueous 
unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin solutions.

4.4 COLLAGEN GEL PREPARATION 
Collagen gels were fabricated based a method adapted from the work of Duan and 
Sheardown (Duan and Sheardown. 2005). Heparin modified collagen gels were prepared 
by first dissolving 1 mL collagen (66 mg/mL) in 1.0 N hydrochloric acid to give a 4% 
solution, followed by the addition of heparin solution (30 mg/ml). Since, heparin is only 
stable under highly acidic conditions for up to 1 hour (Jandik et al. 1996); crosslinking 
was initiated as quickly as possible. Crosslinking was achieved thermally or via two 
chemically methods. The first chemical crosslinking was achieved with a 1-ethyl-3-(3­
dimethylaminopropy I) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N -hydroxysuccinimide 
(EDC/NHS) mixture, and second the chemical crosslinking solution contained EDC/NHS 
components combin:::d with a second generation polypropyleneimine octaamine G2 
dendrimer which ha~; been shown to result in highly crosslinked, stable collagen gels. 
Where appropriate, 1.0 N NaOH was added to adjust the pH as the EDC/NHS reaction 
has been shown to be optimized at a pH of 5.5 (Olde Damink et al. 1996). Prior to 
crosslinking, endotoxin free water (EFW) was added so that the collagen mixture had a 
final collagen concentration of 30 mg/mL. The mixture was pressed between glass plates 
and left overnight to ensure complete crosslinking. Thermally gelled collagen controls 
were prepared without the addition of the EDC/NHS by incubation of the mixture 
overnight in a 37°C oven. The solution pH in this case was raised to 7.4. Control 
collagen gels containing no heparin were also fabricated. The resultant gels were 
punched into 0.625 em (W') surfaces. These were stored at room temperature, but 
-68­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
surfaces were reconstituted in Milli-Q water prior to experimentation. Collagen gel 
recipes are listed in Table 4-1.

4.5 BULK COLLAGEN GEL CHARACTERIZATION 
Collagen gel:; were characterized mainly for bulk properties with water uptake, 
differential scanning colorimetry (DSC). Heparin and dendrimer stability within the 
collagen matrix was .1ssessed with release studies analyzed with metachromatic assays. 
4.5.1 Water uptake 
Water content of the collagen gels was measured to characterize the collagen 
crosslinking. Colla:sen gels were freeze dried in a Modulyo D model freeze dryer 
(Thermo-Savant) and weighed to determine the dry weight (Wct). Afterwards, gels were 
reswollen in Milli-Q water for 1 hour, wicked dry to remove assess water and weighed 
again (Ww). The water uptake was calculated according to the following formula: 
W -WWaterUptake(%) = d w *100% 
ww (Eq.3) 
4.5.2 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) 
Differentical scanning calorimetry (DSC) is traditionally used to study thermally 
induced transition changes (McElhaney. 1982). A reference material and the sample are 
heated at identical rates so their temperature difference remains constant at zero, creating 
a steady baseline of heat supplied as a function of temperature. Upon heating, if a 
thermally induced change occurs to the sample, the temperature difference between the 
reference and sample deviates from zero. In an effort to rectify the temperature 
difference, the DSC instrument supplies more or less heat to the sample, disrupting the 
baseline. A negative deflection from the baseline constitutes an exothermic reaction, 
-71 ­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
with the magnitude of deviation dependant on the magnitude of differential heating rate, 
and denotes the sample's denaturation temperature. 
Denaturation temperatures for collagen modified surfaces were determined via 
differential scanning calorimetry using a TA instruments DSC 2910. Collagen gels were 
immersed in endotoxin free water (EFW) for 2 hrs, dabbed dry, and transferred into 
aluminum hermetic pans. They were exposed to a heating rate of 2 °C/min over a 
temperature range of 15°C to 1 00°C. Peaks deviating from the baseline were monitored 
and analyzed with accompanying DSC software. A hermetic pan filled with endotoxin 
free water was used c~s a reference. 
4.5.3 	 Heparin Stability 
Release of free heparin from the collagen gels was examined in order to quantify 
the total amount of heparin immobilized within the gels. Hydrated collagen gels were 
immersed in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and shaken in a waterbath, at 37°C. The PBS was 
replaced hourly for the first 8 hrs, then twice daily for 2 days, then once on the fourth day 
and finally once on the seventh day. Samples were stored at 4°C prior to analysis for 
heparin concentration via the toluidine blue assay (Kang et al. 1996; Macintosh. 1941; 
Smith, Mallia, and H~rmanson. 1980). 
4.5.4 	 Toluidine Blue Assay 
In a 5 mL test tube, typically 1.5 mL of sample or standard heparin solutions (0-2 
j..tg/mL heparin in 0.~% NaCl) and 0.15 mL of toluidine blue solution (0.005% toluidine 
blue dye with 0.2% NaCl and 0.01 N HCl) were combined. The test tubes were vortexed 
-72­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
for 30 seconds and 1 mL n-hexane added, then shaken by hand for an additional 30 
seconds. The solution was allowed to phase separate, after which the aqueous layer 
removed and analyzed at 630 nm. Sample absorbance values were standardized against 
known standard hep;rrin solutions and heparinized gels were standardized against their 
non-heparin gel counterparts. 
4.5.5 Dendrimer Stability 
Dendrimer re1ctivity with and release from the collagen matrix was assessed by 
analyzing release samples with a Coomasie blue assay (Bradford. 1976; Sapan, Lundblad, 
and Price. 1999). Although this assay is primarily used for protein quantification, through 
protein-dye interactions, its use was extended here, as a crude means of detecting changes 
in pH. Alkaline sul:stances have been shown to interfere with the dye absorbance, 
through a conversion from the cationic to the neutral to the anionic form of the dye, 
causing an absorbanee shift at 595 nm (Stoscheck. 1990). Heparin was not shown to 
interfere with the dye, consistent with Bradford's observations of non-interfering 
carbohydrates (Brad:fi)rd. 1976). 
A release study was performed similar to the heparin stability release, whereby 
hydrated collagen surfaces were immersed in PBS (pH 7.4), shaken at 37°C and sampled 
periodically. 200 f.LL t)fthe release sample, in triplicate, was pipetted into a 96-well plate 
and mixed with 100 !JL ofCoomassie blue solution (50.1 mg Coomassie blue dye powder 
dissolved in 25 mL 9:>% ethanol and 50 mL 85% 0-phosphoric acid and 500 mL Milli-Q 
water). After 5 minutes, the samples were read at 595 nm and subsequent absorbencies 
were compared agaim:t standard curves ofknown dendrimer concentrations in PBS.

4.6 FGF-2 RADIOLABELING, IMMOBILIZATION AND RELEASE 
Both PDMS ,,nd collagen based surfaces, with and without heparin, were exposed 
to radiolabeled FGF-2 to assess growth factor immobilization and assess growth factor 
release. 
4.6.1 125I-FGF-2 Radio labeling Procedure 
FGF-2, reconstituted in tris (hydroxymethyl) methylamine (TRIS) buffer (pH 
7.4), was radiolabelt:d via the IODOGEN method (Klenkler et al. 2005). The growth 
factor solution (100 11L) was combined with 5 JlL of 1251 (500 JlCU I 5 JlL) in an Iodogen 
coated vial and stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature. Free iodine was removed via 
dialysis (MWCO 3500) with TRIS buffer over a 24 hour period. The final concentration 
of the solution was determined spectrophotometrically from known unlabeled FGF -2 
concentrations. 
Free unbound isotope was measured by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. 
In duplicate, 1 mL of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 JlL 1251-FGF-2 and 0.5 mL 
TCA (1.4%) were combined in an eppendorf tube, allowed to react for 10 minutes and 
centrifuged for 2 minutes. The eppendorf supernatant, 0.5 mL, was combined with 0.5 
mL TRIS buffer and its activity read in a gamma counter (Wallac Wizard 3" 1480 
Automatic Gamma Counter, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Two background vials and 2 
control solutions, containing 1 mL TRIS buffer and 2 JlL 1251-FGF-2, were also counted. 
The amount of free i!>otope was calculated via:

4.6.2 1251-FGF-2 Immobilization 
PDMS modified surfaces were exposed to 750 JlL of 1251-FGF-2 solution for 24 
hrs and 3 days. Collagen surfaces were soaked in Milli-Q water for 24 hours, freeze 
dried and exposed to 750 JlL of 1251-FGF-2 solution for 4 days. After exposure times, the 
soak solution and surfaces were dabbed dry and read for activity. To determine FGF-2 
adsorption, surfaces were rinsed three times in TRIS (pH 7.4) for 1 min, dabbed dry and 
read for activity. Riming solutions were also read. 
4.6.3 1251-FGF-2 Release Studies 
Radioactive ~mrfaces were placed into 1 mL of fresh TR1S buffer, in a 37°C 
shaking waterbath. lnitially, release samples were taken every 30 minutes for the first 2 
hrs, then periodically to obtain a gradual FGF-2 release profile. Surface and sample 
radioactivity were rr easured for activity and translated to known concentrations of 1251 
labeled FGF-2.

5. PAPER 1 
Heparin Modified Poly (Dimethyl Siloxane) Surfaces for the Delivery of Basic 
Fibroblast Growth Factor 
The following paper describes the research performed on PDMS modified 
surfaces, intended for keratoprosthetic applications, for soluble FGF-2 delivery through 
heparin immobilizati.:m. This research expands on previous work by Chen eta/. whereby 
PDMS elastomer surfaces were directly modified with N-succinimidyl carbonate (NSC) 
terminated poly (eth:rlene oxide) (PEO) spacers for heparin immobilization (Chen et al. 
2005a; Chen et al. :~005b). The paper also examines a new more robust method of 
generating the reactive surfaces and compares heparinization and release results obtained 
using these two methods. In the previous work, the intended application was as a blood 
contacting material. The current application is related to 1) growth factor delivery and 2) 
biomaterials for kera1:oprosthetic applications. 
Although the exploitation of heparin immobilization for blood contacting 
materials has been widely examined (Brash. 2000; Jee et al. 2004; Klement et al. 2002); 
the use of heparinized materials as growth factor delivery vehicles for angiogenic and 
wound healing apphcations has also been studied (DeLong, Moon, and West. 2005; 
Ishihara et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2002). Many of those delivery systems are hydrogel based 
and lack long-term stability. The significance of heparinization stems from the inability 
to delivery growth factors, without carrier molecules, for extended time periods, as they 
-76­Masters Thes 1s -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
are rapidly degraded upon parental administration (Lee. 2000; Tabata. 2003) and are 
highly unstable in :;elution (Edelman et al. 1991). However, the development of 
heparinized surfaces for delivery and ultimately for inducing subsequent cellular events 
associated with the materials have not been studied. This work provides evidence that 
heparinized PDMS materials are capable of delivering growth factor over sustained time 
periods.

Abstract 
Tissue integration between an artificial corneal implant and the host eye, 
necessary for device anchoring is of critical importance in ensuring the long-term success 
of the implant. Initiation of wound healing responses, leading to stromal integration, has 
been widely shown to facilitate device anchoring. 
FGF-2 was immobilized to a heparin modified poly (dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) 
surface through a p~ly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) spacer, as a means of delivering the 
growth factor in a :;oluble form to initiate a wound healing response. Two similar 
chemical methods were examined for tethering the reactive PEO spacer to the PDMS. In 
the first method, an n-allyl-ro-N-succinimidyl carbonate-poly( ethylene oxide) (allyl-PEO­
NSC) spacer was attached which could be directly functionalized with heparin. The 
second method invoved tethering an a-allyl-hydroxyl-poly(ethylene oxide) (allyl-PEO­
OH) which was sub~:equently functionalized with the reactive N-succinimidyl carbonate 
(NSC) group for heparin attachment. 
Both PEO modification methods were successful, although PEO surface coverage 
was not quantifiabk. Results suggested that direct immobilization gave inconsistent 
heparin surface coverage while the indirect method generally resulted in successful and 
consistent heparinization. Both modification methods resulted in surfaces that were 
capable of binding on average 100 ng/cm2 of FGF-2. Delivery of FGF-2 from the 
directly and indirectly modified surfaces revealed a first order release profile, with an 
initial burst ofFGF<~ followed by gradual release. Over 2 weeks, approximately 6.5% of 
-79­Masters Thes [s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
the total bound growth factor was released from surfaces exposed to FGF-2 for one day, 
while 3 day exposure resulted in a release of 50%.

5.1 INTRODUCTION 
Second only to cataracts in numbers of patients affected, diseases of the cornea 
are a major cause of blindness. The most popular and successful treatment by corneal 
transplantation is limited in some instances by graft rejection and failure, donor tissue 
shortages and the risk of disease transmission (Chirila et al. 1998; Whitcher, Srinivasan, 
and Upadhyay. 2001·~· In certain cases, the only alternative is a keratoprosthesis. 
The success of this type of implant has been shown to depend on compatibility 
with host corneal tissues (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 2006), specifically the 
maintenance of a corneal epithelial cell layer on the surface, for promoting tear 
interactions and pre" enting bacterial infection, and the ingrowth of corneal stromal cells 
for device anchorage (Griffith et al. 2003). Epithelial coverage in vitro has been 
manipulated by the creation of hydrophilic surfaces (Legeais and Renard. 1998) and the 
tethering of adhesion peptides (Aucoin et al. 2002) and growth factors (Klenkler et al. 
2005; Merrett et al. :;,003). Stromal integration has been improved with the use of porous 
skirts allowing anchorage through fibroblast migration and extracellular matrix 
production (Hicks et al. 2000; Kim et al. 2002; Legeais et al. 1994); however tissue 
necrosis and device t::xtrusion remain prevalent over long-term implantations. 
As a means of enticing stromal integration, extracellular matrix components are 
being researched in vitro for stromal integration; they include hydoxyapatite (Mehta et al. 
2005), fibronectin (Langefeld et al. 1999), and various growth factors (Andresen et al. 
2000; Andresen, Ledet, and Ehlers. 1997). Growth factors are the primary mediators of 
wound healing in be eye, thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that the delivery of 
-81 ­Masters Thes .s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
appropriate growth factors may stimulate the cellular healing responses capable of 
initiating cellular integration into the keratoprosthesis (Imanishi et al. 2000). Basic 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), an 18kDa polypeptide, found in the cornea basement 
membranes (Folkman et al. 1988) and epithelium (Wilson, Lloyd, and He. 1992; van 
Setten, Fagerholm, and Cuevas-Sanchez. 1995), has been shown to stimulate all corneal 
cell types, including :ibroblast proliferation and migration (Shipley et al. 1989). 
Although, &~ect topical application of FGF-2 to wounded corneas has been 
shown to increase ht:aling rates (Rieck et al. 1994), therapies are hindered by the short 
half-life ofFGF-2 (Vlhalen, Shing, and Folkman. 1989). Thus a soluble delivery method 
is desirable for :;ustained long-term release. In vivo, extracellular matrix 
glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPs ), are upregulated in stromal 
wound healing (Hsia, Richardson, and Nugent. 2003), and bind to FGF-2 released from 
damaged epithelial c~lls, protecting it from proteolytic degradation (Saksela et al. 1988), 
as well as serving as a delivery reservoir for FGF-2. Therefore it is reasonable to 
hypothesize that heparinization of surfaces may be useful for controlling the release of 
FGF-2. 
In this work, poly (dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) was modified with a bifunctional 
poly (ethylene oxide> (PEO) spacer that was subsequently heparinized for immobilization 
and subsequent release of FGF-2. Release of the growth factor as a function of heparin 
density and other factors were examined.

5.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
5.2.1 Materials 
PDMS components and polymethylhydrogen siloxane fluid (DC 11 07) 
[(MeHSiO)n, 30 centistokes] were purchased from Dow Coming (Mississauga, ON). a­
allyl-co-N-succinimidyl carbonate-poly (ethylene oxide) (allyl-PEO-NSC, MW 500) was 
purchased from JuTian Chemical Co. (Nanjing, China), while the monoallyl-hydroxyl­
terminated poly (ethylene oxide) (allyl-PEO-OH, MW 550) was purchased from Clariant 
(Canada) Inc., (Markham, ON). Triflic acid, Karstedt's platinum catalyst, unfractionated 
heparin and N-N'dis[ccinimidyl carbonate (diNHS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 
(Oakville, ON), while low-molecule weight heparin (LMWH) was obtained from 
Calbiochem (San Diego, USA). FGF-2 was purchased from R & D Systems 
(Minneapolis, MN). 
5.2.2 PDMS Surface Preparation 
PDMS surfaces were prepared according to manufacturers instructions. Briefly, 
the elastomer base a1d curing agent were combined in a 10:1 (w/w) ratio, placed under 
vacuum for approximately 1 hour, and then allowed to cure at room temperature for at 
least 2 days. The flm, with a thickness of approximately 0.5 mm, was punched into 
0.625 em (W') discs. and washed with anhydrous methanol prior to use. Surfaces were 
then modified to incorporate a reactive Si-H group based on the methods described by 
Chen et al. (Chen et al. 2005a; Chen et al. 2006). Briefly thirty PDMS discs were placed 
in a 10 dram glass vial, immersed in a mixture of 5 mL anhydrous methanol, 3 mL DC 
1107 ((MeHSiO)n), and 50 JlL triflic acid (CFS0 3H), and shaken vigorously for 30 
-83­Masters Thes [s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
minutes at room temperature. Discs were then washed with anhydrous methanol and 
dried n-hexane, subst~quently dried with N2 and placed under high vacuum for 8 hours to 
remove residual solvr~nts. 
Two PEO spacers were immobilized to PDMS surfaces, allyl-PEO-NSC (MW 
500) (direct modification), and allyl-PEO-OH (indirect modification). The PDMS-PEO­
NSC surfaces were ready for subsequent heparinization while the PDMS-PEO-OH 
surfaces were subsequently modified with diNHS to incorporate the functional group for 
biological functionalzation. 
Direct graftiLg was achieved by placing 20 PDMS-SiH functionalized surfaces 
with 3 mL dried 2-methoxyethyl ether, 0.6 g allyl-PEO-NSC and 20 !J.L of Karstedt's 
platinum catalyst [(Pt)2(H2C=CH-SiMe20SiMe2CH=CH2)3]. The mixture was purged 
with N2, tightly sealed, placed in a 50°C oil bath and stirred for 15-20 hours. The 
resulting surfaces, PDMS-PEO-NSC, were washed with dried acetone, dried with N2 and 
placed in a desiccator for at least 12 hours. Control hydroxyl-terminated surfaces 
(PDMS-PEO-OH, direct (D)) were prepared by submersing the PDMS-PEO-NSC 
surfaces in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) for 3 days, washed with Milli-Q water 
and wicked dry. 
Indirect graft.ng was achieved by immersing 10 PDMS-SiH surfaces in 1 mL 2­
methoxyethyl ether, 1 mL allyl-PEO-OH and 15 !J.L Karstedt's platinum catalyst. The 
vial was gently shaken on an orbital shaker for 2 hrs, after which surfaces (PDMS-PEO­
OH, indirect (InD)) were rinsed with acetone, dried with N2 and desiccated for 10 hrs. 
To these surfaces was added a pre-dissolved mixture of 0.6 g diNHS in 1 mL anhydrous 
-84­diNHS

acetonitrile and 100 J.!L triethylamine (TEA). The mixture was purged with Nz and 
gently shaken on an orbital shaker for 6 hrs. Surfaces were then rinsed with anhydrous 
acetonitrile and 2-methoxyethyl ether, dried with Nz and desiccated for at least 12 hrs 
The mechani~ms are illustrated in Figure 5-1.

indirect with an allyl-PEO-OH hydrosylation followed by NSC functionalization

Heparinization of directly and indirectly modified PDMS surfaces was achieved 
through exposure of 30 surfaces to 5 mL of a 10 mg/mL heparin solution in phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS, pH 8.0) for at least 6 hrs. Surfaces were then removed, rinsed with 
PBS, and wicked dry. Indirectly modified surfaces were also exposed to LMWH in a 
similar manner.

5.2.3 Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer 
A Bio Rad FTS-40 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) 
equipped with a DTGS detector and a vertical attenuated total reflection (A TR) module, 
with a zinc selenide crystal, was used to scan PDMS, PDMS reaction intermediates and 
the final PDMS-PEO-Heparin surfaces to verify surface reactions. 
5.2.4 X-ray Photodectron Spectroscopy 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed at Surface Interface 
Ontario, University of Toronto, using a Leybold (Specs) MAX 200. Peaks were analyzed 
with the corresponding software. Low resolution and high resolution spectra were 
collected at take off ,,ngles of 20° and 90°. 
5.2.5 Water Contact Angles 
Advancing and receding sessile drop contact angles were measured on a bench 
top goniometer (NRL C.A. Goniometer, Rame-hart, USA). Milli-Q water was used with 
a drop volume of 20 ~-tL. Contact angles were performed in triplicate on each side of the 
surface. 
5.2.6 Heparin Density 
Heparin dens[ty was quantified via a slightly adapted version ofthe toluidine blue 
assay (Hinrichs et al 1997; Macintosh. 1941). Briefly, surfaces were exposed to a 0.5% 
toluidine blue solution (with 0.2% sodium chloride (NaCl) and 0.01 N hydrochloric acid 
(HCl)) overnight. SLlbsequently, surfaces were rinsed 3 times in Milli-Q water, dabbed 
dry and placed in 700 ~-tL of 4:1 ethanol: 0.1 N NaOH solution overnight. The surfaces 
-86­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
were then removed from the solution and the absorbance of the ethanol solution read at 
540 nm. Absorbance values were standardized against standard heparin solutions, 
created by exposing known concentrations of dissolved heparin in PBS (pH 7.4) to 0.5% 
toluidine blue solution (0.2% NaCl and 0.01 N HCl) overnight. Standards were then 
centrifuged at 1 OOOg for 10 min and the supernatant carefully removed. The pellet was 
resuspended in a 4:1 (v/v) ethanol: 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution and read at 
540 nm. 
5.2.7 	Heparin Activity 
As an altem:ttive means to quantify heparin immobilization, its activity was 
assessed by exploiting its involvement with antithrombin III and factor Xa (Ingber. 1991; 
Teien and Lie. 197~') and compared to the activity of known heparin concentrations. 
Heparin activity on heparinized PDMS surfaces was quantified using an anti-Factor Xa 
assay kit (Stachrom® Heparin, Diagnostica Stago, France) according to the 
manufacturer's instmctions. Briefly, surfaces were exposed to 100 11L purified bovine 
antithrombin III (AT-III) and either 800 11L for unfractionated heparin, or 1 mL for 
LMWH, in 0.1 N tris (hydroxymethyl) methylamine-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid 
(TRIS EDTA) buffer (pH 8.4) for 2 min at 37°C. Then, the surfaces and 200 11L of the 
AT-III solution were transferred to a new test tube, and 200 IlL purified bovine factor Xa 
was added and the :;amples were incubated for 30 sec at 37°C. Next, 200 11L of the 
chromogenic substrate (CBS 31.39) was added, the samples incubated for an additional 
30 sec at 37°C and tl:e reaction terminated with 200 11L glacial acetic acid. Surfaces were 
removed and the solutions read in a UV spectrophotometer at 540 nm. Calibration curves 
-87­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
were created with known concentrations of aqueous unfractionated and low molecular 
weight heparin. 
5.2.8 1251 Labelled FGF -2 Immobilization 
FGF-2, reconstituted in tris (hydroxymethyl) methylamine (TRIS) buffer (pH 
7.4), was radiolabelkd via the IODO-GEN method (Pierce, USA). Briefly, 100 IlL FGF­
2 was exposed to 5 ~lL of 1251 (500 11Cu I 5 IlL) in an Iodogen coated vial and stirred for 
15 minutes at room temperature. Free iodide was removed by overnight dialysis against 
TRIS buffer. Free unbound isotope was measured by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) 
precipitation with bo·,rine serum albumin (BSA). 
The 1251 labeJed FGF-2 was then reacted with the various heparinized surfaces 
described above, for 24 hrs or 3 days. To assess FGF-2 adsorption, surfaces were rinsed 
in fresh 1mL TRIS for 1 min, three times. 
5.2.9 1251 Labelled FGF -2 Release Studies 
Radioactive FGF-2 containing surfaces were placed into fresh TRIS buffer, in a 
37°C shaking waterhath. Release samples were taken at regular intervals in order to 
capture the FGF-2 release profile. Initial surface radioactivity and the radioactivity of the 
samples were measured with a gamma counter (Wallac Wizard 3" 1480 Automatic 
Gamma Counter, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) and translated to FGF-2 release profiles.

5.2.10 Statistical Analysis 
Data, in tripli>::ate, was averaged and variability assessed with standard deviations, 
unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was determined with a single factor 
Anova test, with p < ,).05. 
5.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
5.3.1 PDMS Surface Preparation 
PDMS surfaces were prepared by siloxane vulcanization, whereby 
dimethylsilicone ela~:tomer is crosslinked with hydromethylsilicone in the presence of 
platinum. Further rr edification, under acidic conditions with triflic acid and DC 1107, 
resulted in functionalization ofthe PDMS surface with reactive Si-H groups. 
Next, PEO, either premodified with NSC groups or -OH termination for 
subsequent NSC functionalization, was grafted. The former method, termed direct 
grafting, yielded PEO modified surfaces with reactive functional groups for subsequent 
modification (PDMS-PEO-NSC). Surfaces that stuck together or to the surface of the 
vial were discarded to ensure that only high quality surfaces were subsequently 
functionalized and L~sted. Surfaces generally remained clear throughout the reaction 
process, although surfaces reacting for more than 24 hrs were stained black, presumably 
due to platinum poisoning. 
Indirect graft.ng first involved the tethering of allyl-PEO-OH, in the presence of 
platinum, to create Lydroxyl-terminated PDMS surfaces, PDMS-PEO-OH. Despite the 
short reaction time for PDMS-PEO-OH fabrication, many surfaces were damaged and 
discoloured due to platinum poisoning; decreasing the amount of platinum added did not 
-89­Masters Thes: s -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
seem to alter this result. Doubling the solvent and PEO amounts did improve the yield of 
clear surfaces. As with the previous reaction, damaged or translucent surfaces were 
discarded and not used for subsequent reactions. In the second stage of preparation of the 
indirect grafting surfaces, the PDMS-PEO-OH was reacted with diNHS, through 
nucleophilic substitution, to yield the reactive NSC surface. To facilitate the dissolving 
of diNHS, triethylamine (TEA) was added to acetonitrile. As TEA is a nucleophile, it has 
the potential to compete for PDMS-PEO-OH, but given the small amount added, it is 
assumed that its interference would be minimal. 
The resulting PDMS-PEO-NSC surfaces had a slight gold tint presumably due to 
the presence of an inpurity in the diNHS, as reaction with a higher purity was found to 
decrease the tinting. In the future it would be desirable to react with even higher purity 
diNHS to eliminate tnting altogether, particularly for use in cornea applications. 
Heparinization with unfractionated heparin (HEP) was achieved by exposing the 
directly and indirec1ly modified PDMS-PEO-NSC surfaces to heparin solutions. To 
assess steric hindrance of the heparin binding, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 
was also exposed to surfaces fabricated indirectly. These surfaces were then exposed to 
concentrations of FGF-2 to generate PDMS-PEO-HEP-FGF-2 (direct and indirect) and 
PDMS-PEO-LMWH-FGF-2 (indirect) surfaces. No visible surface abnormalities were 
observed in either of those processes.

5.3.2 ATR FTIR 
ATR FTIR spectra for the various PDMS surfaces modified by the direct grafting 
method are shown in Figure 5-2; spectra for the indirect grafted surfaces are shown in 
Figure 5-3. 
Unmodified PDMS has a characteristic methyl peak at ~3000 cm-1, while Si-H 
functionalization reslllts in the appearance of a peak at ~2166 cm-1 due to the Si-H 
stretch, shown in both Figures. Subsequent reactions of the PDMS-Si-H surface, whether 
reacted by the indirect or direct method, results in the disappearance of this Si-H stretch. 
With the addition of PEO to the surface, a peak appears at 2870 cm-1 characteristic of the 
1 1CHz stretch of PEO, while peaks 1455 cm-, 1349 cm-, 1288 cm-1 represent the CHz 
scissoring of PEO, the antisymmetric OCHz-CHz stretch and symmetric OCH2-CHz, 
respectively. The addition of reactive NSC groups to the surface is evident by fingerprint 
peaks at 1600cm-1 ard 1200cm-1• Direct grafting of allyl-PEO-NSC to the surface gave 
peaks corresponding to PEO tethering, along with the reactive NSC group, while the 
indirect grafting of allyl-PEO-OH followed by the diNHS reaction gave a similar result. 
There were no diffen:nces between direct and indirect methods overall, except that it was 
very difficult to creat~~ directly modified surfaces with predominant PEO and NSC peaks, 
presumably due to fa,~tors such as the sampling depth ofthe ATR-FTIR technique. It is 
possible that longer reaction times may have favoured increased generation of reactive 
groups but platinum poisoning of these surfaces had to be considered.

FTIR, shown in Figure 5-4, was performed to verify modification with 
unfractionated heparin and LMWH. Both had sharp peaks at 1250cm-1 and 1620cm-1, 
characteristic of sulp1onated and amino side groups, and a broad peak between 3300cm-1

5.3.3 X-ray photo,electron spectroscopy 
XPS analysiB of directly and indirectly modified PDMS surfaces, at take off 
angles of 20° and 90°, are summarized in Table 5-l. High resolution Cis spectra of 
PDMS and its modified counterparts are shown in Figure 5-5. 
Unmodified PDMS, showed expected amounts of carbon, oxygen and silicone 
(Merrett et al. 2003) and further showed a high resolution carbon peak at 284.4 eV, 
indicative of C-H bonds of the PDMS methyl carbon groups. 
In both grafting methods, PEO grafting correlated to an increase in CIs and 0 Is, 
and a decrease in Si2p, as expected. PEO high resolution spectra showed two peaks, the 
first indicative of the unmodified PDMS carbon molecules, while the peak at 286.4 e V 
represents the C-0 bends ofPEO, providing evidence ofPEO grafting. This peak is also 
representative of the percent of PEO on the surface (Merrett et al. 2002), which supports 
higher PEO coverage via indirect grafting compared to direct grafting methods. Also of 
interest are the inconsistencies seen with PEO grafting, when comparing two heparinized 
surfaces fabricated vic. indirect grafting. 
The elemental heparin ratio is estimated to be C:O:N:S = I2:I4:2:I (Chen et al. 
2005a). Therefore an increase in Cis, Ols and C:O ratio, as well as the appearance of 
S2p would be expected following heparinization of the surface. Although there was no 
great increase in C 1 s, heparinized surfaces did show an increase in 0 Is, indicative of the 
hydroxyl functional groups of heparin. Sulphur, S2p, was also evident, but in much 
smaller amounts than would be expected. Only O.I atom% was observed for direct and 
indirect heparinization with 0.2 atom% present for indirect modification with LMWH. 
-95­Masters Thes,s-M.A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
Previous studies of immobilized heparin on poly (urethane) based surfaces with carboxyl 
or amine groups resulted in sulphur percentages of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively (Kang et al. 
1996), while Chen et al.'s heparinized PDMS-PEO surfaces, fabricated via direct 
grafting, showed 0.4% S2p (Chen et al. 2005a). The C:O ratio did increase with direct 
grafting methods, pre vi ding evidence of surface immobilized heparin on the surface; this 
was not as prevalent with indirect grafting, likely attributable to poor PEO grafting and 
subsequent heparinization. Not surprisingly, as with other studies, high resolution spectra 
failed to conclusively demonstrate heparin modification (Chen et al. 2005a; Sefton et al. 
2001), presumably due to the presence of similar functional groups on the unmodified 
surfaces. Therefore, XPS analysis of the materials failed to conclusively demonstrated 
heparinization. However, the high vacuum environment and highly surface active nature 
of the PDMS substrat1~ materials may have been a contributing factor.

Figure 5-6. Advancing (adv) and receding (rec) contact angles for modified PDMS 
surfaces. Unmodified PDMS had a high contact angle, indicating surface 
hydrophobicity. PDMS surfaces modified with PEO had a lower contact angle, thus 
increased hydrophilicity, with heparinized surfaces demonstrating more hydrophilicity. 
Unmodified PDM S surfaces had a high advancing contact angle of 102 ± 2.8° and a 
receding angle of contact angle of 91.5 ± 2.7°, characteristic of its hydrophobic and relatively 
uniform surface. Following direct and indirect modification to create PDMS-PEO-OH 
surfaces, both the advancing (p = 0.002 and 0.049, respectively) and receding angles (p = 
0.000055 and 0.005, respectively) decreased significantly, indicative of a more hydrophilic 
surface, thus supporting PEO tethering. The contact angles were lower for indirectly 
-99­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
modified surfaces, compared to directly modified surfaces. Heparinized surfaces modified 
directly did not differ fl·om their PEO controls, while indirectly heparinized surfaces did 
differ. There was no significant difference between LMWH and unfractionated heparin. 
Compared with previous work (Chen et al. 2005a; Chen et al. 2005b), the contact 
angles observed in the eurrent study were considerably higher, along with the variability. 
This could be due to a lower level of surface grafting. As well, upon exposure to air, the 
PDMS-PEO elastomer r~~organizes, exposing the hydrophobic PDMS methyl groups to the 
surface, to decrease surface energy, which in turn could increase hydrophobicity (Chen et al. 
2005a). However, in water, the elastomer can reorient to have the hydrophilic PEO to the 
surface. Therefore it wo 1ld be prudent to perform these experiments with hydrated surfaces, 
use the captive bubble water technique or measure contact angles in a humid environment. 
Finally, using a goniometer to determine contact angles depends greatly on individual 
technique; as such the variability seen here could also be due to novice experimenter skills. 
5.3.5 Heparin Density 
Heparinized surfaces were exposed to toluidine blue solution to determine and 
visualize the surface co\<erage of heparin. Results, shown in Figure 5-7 demonstrate that 
toluidine blue dye forms a complex with the heparin molecule, a reaction hypothesized to be 
through hydrophobic and ionic interactions (Moxon and Slifkin. 1973) and this reaction can 
also occur with immobilized heparin (Smith, Mallia, and Hermanson. 1980). As expected, 
unmodified PDMS and nodified PDMS-PEO-OH surfaces did not react with the dye, nor 
was there evidence of dye adsorption. Heparinized PDMS surfaces exposed to toluidine 
-100­Masters Thesis -\1. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
blue however became very dark blue, suggesting that a reasonable heparin layer had been 
formed despite the negative XPS results. 
Grafting method 2 
Figure 5-7. PDMS surfaces exposed to toluidine blue dye to illustrate surface coverage 
of heparin. Control surfaces, PDMS and PDMS-PEO-OH, did not bind toluidine blue, 
while heparinized surfaces turned blue. Direct grafting has inconsistent heparin 
coverage, while direct grafting shows more uniform binding. 
Interestingly, directly modified surfaces showed incomplete dye binding, and thus 
uneven heparin coverage. Instances of incomplete coverage correlated well with ATR-FfiR 
results with weak NSC md PEO peaks. Uniform heparin coverage was achieved with 
indirectly modified surfaces; however there were batches that showed no staining. Again, 
these results were consistent with ATR-FfiR results. 
Ethanol solutions ~evered the heparin-dye complex (Hinrichs et al. 1997), allowing 
toluidine blue to be retrieved from heparinized surfaces, quantified and related back to 
heparin concentration. H ~parin densities determined using this method are summarized in 
Table 5-2. 
-101 ­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
As PDMS and PDMS-PEO-OH surfaces did not bind toluidine blue, their calculated 
heparin density was assumed to be background interference and the average was subtracted 
from the results for the heparinized surfaces. On average, directly grafted surfaces had a 
relatively low heparin d~nsity at 0.34 f.!g/cm2, and these surfaces showed high variability. 
The highest densities obtained with the direct method, roughly 1.2 f.!g/cm2, were similar to 
what was obtained with the indirect method. While there was some variability between 
indirectly modified batches, it was slightly lower than values corresponding to the directly 
modified surfaces. There was generally low variability within batches, regardless of 
modification method.

Immobilized heparin has been quantified elsewhere. Polysulphone surfaces had 
reported heparin densitie~: of 1.38f.!g/cm2 (Xu et al. 2001), while heparinized polyurethane 
surfaces had densities of 1.4 to 2f.!g/cm2 (Kang et al. 1996). Earlier work of fabricating 
heparinized PDMS-PEO :;urfaces via direct PEO grafting resulted in surfaces with heparin 
densities of 0.68f.!g/cm2 (Chen et al. 2005a). In the current work, similar heparin densities 
-102­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
were obtained. Howev1!r further optimization of grafting methods is needed to decrease 
batch to batch variation. 
5.3.6 	 Heparin Activit) 
Heparin activity was determined through an anti-Factor Xa assay kit, to ensure 
appropriate heparin configuration for further FGF-2 conjugation, and as an alternative means 
to quantify heparin density through antithrombogenic and concentration correlations. 
Heparin activity is routinely used to determine heparin concentration in plasma (Fitch et al. 
1999), despite a disproportional relationship between surface heparin density and 
anticoagulant activity (l indhout et al. 1995). Heparin activity is greatly influenced by 
heparin heterogeneity, ~pecifically the occurrence of a high-affinity pentasaccharide 
sequence, and chain length (Lin, Sinha, and Betz. 2001 ), whereby smaller heparin molecules 
(>18 saccharides) are incapable of binding to antithrombin III and thrombin simultaneously 
(Hirsh and Raschke. 2004 ). 
Only surfaces that demonstrated heparin immobilization with toluidine blue were 
assessed for heparin activty. The results are summarized in Table 5-3.

Heparin densitie:;, found via heparin activity assay, were similar between PDMS 
modification methods, at ~1.1 J.tg/cm2, although there exists batch to batch variation, similar 
to what was seen with toluidine blue quantification. The large variations within directly 
modified batches could be attributed to improper mixing and larger batch sizes. Insufficient 
mixing and diNHS chemical impurities could result in indirect grafting variation. As well, 
platinum poisoning could unknowingly damage the surface rendering it unsuitable for 
modification. 
Not unexpectedly, heparin densities between the two types of heparin were not 
comparable in this analysis as they were when dyed with toluidine blue. With LMWH a 
heparin density of 0.566 1.tg/cm2, half the value of unfractionated heparinized surfaces, was 
observed. This is attributable to the presence or lack of presence of the high-affinity 
pentasaccharide sequence that interacts with antithrombin III. LMWH, a result of 
depolymerized heparin chains, will have a large percentage of chains that are too short for 
inhibition and will contan fewer pentasaccharide sequences, rendering it less effective for 
antithrombin III binding (Hirsh and Raschke. 2004). It is estimated that 25 to 50% of 
LMWH species are incapable of antithrombin binding. Thus it could be expected to see a 
similar loss in activity, as was evident here, through the difference in heparin densities 
between unfractionated ard LMWH modified surfaces. 
5.3.7 1251 Labelled FGF'-2 Immobilization 
Heparinized surfaees were exposed to 125I labelled FGF -2 to assess the amount of 
bound FGF-2 to the surface. Figure 5-8 illustrates FGF-2 binding over 24 hours and 3 days, 
and the amount of growth factor that remained after rinsing with TRIS buffer. 
-104­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
PDMS and, somewhat surprisingly, PEO surfaces seemed to adsorb FGF-2 to a high 
degree. While high levt:ls of adsorption on PDMS surfaces are not unexpected due to their 
hydrophobic nature, tb e tethering of PEO using this method has been previously 
demonstrated to significantly decrease levels of adsorbed protein. It is believed that two 
factors are likely contrib llting to this effect. XPS and other results seem to demonstrate that, 
although not directly qwmtifiable, the PEO density of these surfaces is potentially lower on 
these materials than on materials previously synthesized. As well, it is possible that FGF-2, a 
smaller protein than was used in previous studies may be able to interact with and adsorb to 
the surfaces.

Values are averages of:~ surfaces, with standard error bars. 
There exists a lage difference in the amount of FGF-2 taken up by the directly 
modified surfaces compared with the indirectly modified surfaces, although this may have 
-105­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
resulted from batch to batch variation. However, the amount of FGF-2 taken up by the 
indirectly grafted surfaces was relatively unaffected by the use of broad spectrum heparin 
compared with LMWH, which is unexpected, as the binding affinity of FGF-2 to heparin 
increases with increasing molecular chain length (Faham, Linhardt, and Rees. 1998). The 
variability seen on the PDMS-PEO-HEP and PDMS-PEO-LMWH surfaces is attributed to 
the high variability of PEO bound to the surface and its subsequent reaction to heparin, 
evident by the variable h1!parin densities discussed earlier. There were significant (p = 0.005) 
increases in the amount Clf growth factor associated with the surfaces after 3 days of exposure 
compared with one day of exposure suggesting that longer time periods were necessary to 
obtain the highest potential for FGF-2 release. 
5.3.8 1251 Labelled FGF -2 Release Studies 
Release of the ra:liolabeled FGF-2 into TRlS buffer (pH 7.4) at 37°C are shown in 
Figure 5-9, for the first 38 days of release from the surfaces soaked for 24 hours, and in 
Figure 5-10, for surfaces soaked for 3 days over the first 29 days of release. As expected, 
release of FGF-2 for all PDMS surfaces began with an initial burst of FGF-2 followed by 
first order gradual release. Large error and improper percentage release values can be 
attributed to batch variati,)n and their averaging. 
Heparinized sur:fitces exposed to 125!-FGF-2 for 1 day released, over 2 weeks, 
approximately 6.5% of originally immobilized FGF-2, while 3 day exposure studies lead to a 
release rate of 50%. It is unexpected that the release rates differ so much, perhaps related to 
surface exposure times and FGF-2 adsorption. There was also evidence of high free iodine 
for surfaces soaked for :~4 hrs, thus those results may not truely represent FGF-2 release. 
-106­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
Indirectly modified PDMS-PEO-HEP had a slower release rate indicative of surface 
heparinization and subsequent FGF-2 immobilization. Surprising is the high release rate of 
PDMS-PEO-OH surfaces, however this could be explained by incomplete surface coverage 
and FGF-2 adsorption eluted to earlier with the FGF-2 immobilization studies. Differences 
between unfractionated heparin and its low molecular weight counterpart could be 
attributable to chain length, which may influence storage capabilities of FGF-2. The late 
burst ofPDMS-PEO-LMWH in Figure 10 is unexpected and likely due to experimental error.

Of extreme impmtance is the maintenance ofFGF-2 activity during release. Although 
in vitro cell stimulation of released FGF-2 was not performed, there is evidence of FGF-2 
instability when releasee without heparin. For instance, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer 
matrices were capable of delivering 37% of FGF-2 over 2 weeks. However all bioactivity 
was lost, evident from the lack of stimulation of fibroblasts (Edelman et al. 1991). Thus 
PDMS and PDMS-PEO-OH surfaces that adsorbed FGF-2 are likely to have adsorbed and 
released denatured protein, incapable of stimulating the desired wound healing response. 
-108­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
FGF-2 activity was shown to be maintained when released with heparin-sepharose beads and 
stored FGF-2 solutions could be stabilized with the addition ofheparin (Edelman et al. 1991). 
Thus the soluble FGF-2 release with heparin seen here is more likely to maintain FGF-2 
activity. Studies of the efficacy of these released growth factors are ongoing. Interestingly, 
heparin added to release media has been found to increase release (Liu et al. 2002) and is 
capable of stabilizing FGF-2 further. It would be noteworthy to conduct release studies of 
that nature, to better predict in vivo release, as there is increased glycosaminoglycan 
production during corneal wound healing (Hassell et al. 1983) and the presence of free 
heparin is likely. 
5.4 CONCLUSIONS 
PDMS-PEO-heparin surfaces were fabricated using two methods, termed direct and 
indirect. Although both methodologies were straight forward and resulted in PDMS-PEO­
Heparin surfaces, the din:ct modification method showed batch variation and highly reactive 
surfaces were difficult to reproduce. Indirect modification resulted in frequent surface 
damage and platinum po soning but is generally thought to be more promising and overall 
simpler to perform. With uniform PEO coverage, heparin densities on the order of 1 J.tg/cm2 
were obtained; much of the heparin on these surfaces was active. High levels of FGF-2 
could be immobilized for subsequent release. Heparinized PDMS modified surfaces soaked 
for 3 days released 50% (over 2 weeks), of initially immobilized FGF-2, indicating that slow 
and gradual release was possible. These materials have potential for the delivery of FGF-2 
in corneal wound healing :md artificial cornea applications.

Dendrimer Crosslinked Collagen Matrices Modified with Heparin for the Delivery of 
Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor 
This paper descn bes the fabrication of polypropyleneimine octaamine generation 2 
(G2) dendrimer crosslinked gels, expanding on previous work by Duan and Sheardown 
through the integration of heparin for soluble FGF-2 delivery for applications of tissue 
engineered corneal equivalents (TECEs). 
Heparinized gro\\ th factor delivery systems have gained critical importance, as FGF­
2 delivery without carrier molecules results in rapid protein release and premature 
denaturation of the gro\\th factor (Edelman et al. 1991). Previously fabricated heparinized 
collagen based growth £1ctor delivery systems were intended as degradable hydrogels for 
angiogenesis and wound healing (DeBlois, Cote, and Doillon. 1994; Pieper et al. 2002; 
Sakiyama-Elbert and Hubbell. 2000; Wissink et al. 2001; Wissink, M. J. B. et al. 2001) and 
lack the mechanical stability required for TECEs. The collagen gels with polypropyleneimine 
octaamine G2 dendrimer integration achieved by Duan and Sheardown demonstrate 
increased stability, when 1;ompared to traditional chemical crosslinking techniques (Duan and 
Sheardown. 2005; Duan and Sheardown. 2006b ). 
In this work, free amine groups on the dendrimers were exploited to permit the 
incorporation of FGF-2 and to generate biologically active collagen matrices through the 
-115­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
incorporation of heparin. Characterization of these surfaces indicates similar integrity to 
unheparinized surfaces although optimization of reaction kinetics may improve the results. 
Heparinized dendrimer crosslinked collagen, exposed to FGF-2, demonstrated high 
growth factor immobilization and prolonged growth factor release. However release kinetics 
from unheparinized mat,~rials were not significantly different. As well, analysis of FGF-2 
bioactivity is pending.

Abstract 
A tissue engineered corneal equivalent must be transparent and durable, with 
properties comparable tc the refractive index and tensile strength of a natural cornea. Tissue 
integration between the tissue engineered corneal equivalent and the host eye is of critical 
importance to ensure long-term implant success. As in wound healing, it is hypothesized that 
corneal tissue integration can be achieved by the stimulation of fibroblast migration through 
growth factor stimulation. Therefore it is necessary to delivery appropriate growth factors to 
the cells in an active fonn. Here we investigate heparinized chemically crosslinked collagen 
gels and their ability to deliver basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2). 
Collagen gels crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide 
hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry, and varying amounts of 
polypropyleneimine oc1aamine generation 2 (G2) dendimer were synthesized with 
immobilized heparin. 
Swelling studies indicated that thermal gel stability was compromised by heparin 
addition, where as there was insignificant difference between chemically crosslinked gels and 
their heparinized counterparts. Differential scanning calorimetry indicated much higher 
denaturation temperatures for dendrimer crosslinked gels (96°C), which was slightly lowered 
with the addition of heparin (89°C). Interestingly, dendrimer crosslinked gels with or 
without heparin gave multiple denaturation peaks, as did heparinized EDC gels, thought to be 
the result of the heterc geneous crosslinking possible between collagen, dendrimer and 
heparin. Heparin leaching was observed with uncrosslinked heparin, decreasing with 
increasing chemical cros5linking. Finally, release of FGF-2 from collagen gels gave a first 
-118­Masters Thesis-M.A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
order release profile, with an initial burst, followed by a prolonged gradual release. 
Heparinized dendrimer crosslinked gels released approximately 40% over 2 weeks.

6.1 INTRODUCTION 
The cornea, a to11gh, transparent tissue located at the front of the eye, protects the 
optical elements from ultraviolet light and environmental hazards, as well as performing 
more than 80% ofthe refractive function of the eye. Corneal and ocular trauma account for 2 
million new cases of corneal blindness annually; making cornea blindness the second leading 
cause of blindness worldwide after cataracts (Whitcher, Srinivasan, and Upadhyay. 2001). 
Allograft surgery, the nost widely used treatment, has an initial success rate of 80%. 
However there are instan:;es of graft rejection and failure in severe cases (Chirila et al. 1998). 
Furthermore, with increasing demand for corneal donor tissue, almost doubling in the past 
decade, an increasing shc>rtage of tissue (National Coalition for Vision Health. 2005), and the 
chance of allotypic dist:ase transmission, a reasonable synthetic alternative is desirable. 
Unfortunately, an acceptable artificial cornea implant that interacts well with host tissue is 
not yet available (Carlsson et al. 2003). 
Tissue-engineerec. cornea equivalents (TECE) are artificial corneal implants based on 
cellular repair strategie~, whereby extracellular matrix components are combined with 
immortalized corneal cells lines to increase host integration (Duan, Klenkler, and Sheardown. 
2006). Much interest ha~: surrounded collagen based TECE (Doillon et al. 2003; Germain et 
al. 1999; Duan and Shecrdown. 2005; Orwin, Borene, and Rubel. 2003) since the corneal 
structure is predominantl:r type I collagen (Meek and Boote. 2004). However, pure collagen 
thermal gels are limited by weak intrafibrillar interactions, opacity, and are prone to rapid 
enzymatic degradation in vivo (Olde Damink et al. 1996), rendering them unsuitable for most 
TECE applications. An alternative is to introduce chemical crosslinkers which can either 
-120­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
facilitate covalent crossli nking of collagen fibrils or act as bridges between collagen fibrils 
and increase collagen gel strength (Rault et al. 1996; Wallace and Rosenblatt. 2003). 
Crosslinking with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride 
(EDC) catalyzes "zero-length" collagen crosslinking (Grabarek and Gergely. 1990), and 
achieves increased crosslinking density (Olde Damink et al. 1996), but is limited by the 
number of amine groups in the collagen molecule (Duan and Sheardown. 2005; Liu et al. 
2006a; Liu et al. 2006b ). Duan and Sheardown hypothesized that increasing the number of 
amine groups may incre ::tse the degree of crosslinking and utilized multifunctional amine 
terminated dendrimers as crosslinking agents (Duan and Sheardown. 2005), resulting in 
materials with mechanical properties suitable for suturing and which showed good in vitro 
compatibility (Duan and Sheardown. 2006b). Furthermore, they demonstrated that the 
incorporation of biological functional groups, through free amine groups present on the 
dendrimer, was possible (Duan et al. 2006a (Ahead ofprint)). 
To enhance the cytocompatibility and host integration with a TECE, growth factor 
delivery may be desired as growth factors are active in corneal wound healing by stimulating 
cell migration (Imanishi et al. 2000). Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) has been shown 
to increase healing (Rieck et al. 1994) and influence fibroblast migration in the stroma 
(Shipley et al. 1989). However given its short half life in vivo (Whalen, Shing, and Folkman. 
1989), appropriate delivery methods are required. Heparin, a glycosaminoglycan, capable of 
stabilizing FGF-2 (Sommer and Rifkin. 1989) and maintaining its bioactivity 
(Gospodarowicz and Cheng. 1986) in a manner similar to in vivo extracellular heparan 
sulphate proteoglycans (Saksela et al. 1988), has been utilized to facilitate the delivery of 
FGF-2 in a soluble form (Edelman et al. 1991; Fujita et al. 2004; Ishihara et al. 2001; 
-121 ­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
Ishihara et al. 2003; Jeon et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2002; Sakiyama-Elbert and Hubbell. 2000; 
Zamora et al. 2002). In this work, we investigated EDC and G2 dendrimer crosslinked 
collagen gels with immobilized heparin for the delivery ofFGF-2. 
6.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
6.2.1 Materials 
Concentrated collagen suspensions (98 mg/mL) of pepsin digested bovine cornium 
purified type I collagen, with less then 20% type III collagen, was a generous gift from 
!named Corporation (California, USA). 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide 
hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and unfractionated heparin were 
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON). Polypropyleneimine octaamine generation 
two (G2) dendrimer was purchased from SyMO-Chem (Eindhoven, The Netherlands). FGF­
2 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, USA). 
6.2.2 Collagen Gel Fabrication 
Collagen gels Wt:re fabricated based a method adapted from the work of Duan and 
Sheardown (Duan and S1eardown. 2005). Collagen was diluted to 6% (v/v) with phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and 1 mL was acidified with 1.0 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) 
prior to heparin treatm;!nt and crosslinking. Various heparin containing collagen gels 
fabricated. 
Thermally crosslinking heparin-collagen (C-H) gels were prepared by adding 450 J.!L 
heparin solution (30 mg/mL), adjusting the pH to 7.4 with 1.0 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 
diluting the suspension with endotoxin free water (EFW) for a final collagen concentration of 
30 mg/mL, and incubating overnight at 37°C. 
-122­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
Carbodiimide crosslinked heparin collagen (C-H-EDC) gels were prepared with the 
addition of 200 j..LL of a 1 mL EDC/NHS solution of 75 mg EDC and 45 mg NHS (molar 
ratio ofEDC:NHS:COOH = 5:5:1). Dendrimer heparin collagen gels were crosslinked with 
the EDC/NHS solution ~;ombined with a second generation polypropyleneimine octaamine 
dendrimer (G2). Three dendrimer gels were created with different crosslinking solutions 
containing different EDC:NHS:dendrimer weight ratios. The first, C-H-G2, had 200 j.!L of a 
(2.27:1.36:1) crosslinking solution of EDC:NHS:G2 (w/w/w); the second, C-H-20%G2, 
contained a higher mc,lar amount of the crosslinking solution (1.98: 1.19:1) (w/w/w) 
crosslinking solution; while the highest dendrimer concentration gel, C-H-2G2, had a 
(0.99:0.59:1) (w/w/w) crosslinking solution. In all cases, the amount of heparin in the 
systems remained consta11t. 
The chemical crosslinking solutions were added to the collagen suspension after the 
addition of heparin. Where appropriate, 1.0 N NaOH was added to adjust the pH to 5.5, to 
stabilize the EDC/NHS reaction (Olde Damink et al. 1996). As with the thermally 
crosslinked collagen gels, the final collagen concentrations of the chemically crosslinked gels 
were 30 mg/mL. Collagen gels without heparin were fabricated as controls. All suspensions 
were pressed between glass plates and left overnight to ensure complete crosslinking, and 
then punched into 0.625 em (W') diameter surfaces. Gels were dried and stored at room 
temperature until need,~d. Surfaces were reconstituted in Milli-Q water prior to 
experimentation. 
-123­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
6.2.3 Water uptake 
Water content of the collagen gels was measured to characterize the collagen 
crosslinking. The dry weight (W ct) of the gels was determined following freeze drying. 
Following reswelling in \1illi-Q water for 1 hour, the gels were wicked dry to remove surface 
moisture and the wet weights (Ww) were determined. The water uptake was calculated 
according to the following formula: 
W -WWaterUptake(%) = d w *100% 
ww (Eq.1) 
6.2.4 Differential Scanning Calorimetry 
Denaturation temperatures for collagen materials were determined by differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a TA instruments DSC 2910. Collagen gels were 
immersed in EFW for 2 hrs, dabbed dry, and transferred into aluminum hermetic pans. They 
were exposed to a heating rate of 2°C/min over a temperature range of 15°C to 100°C. Peaks 
deviating from the baseline were monitored and analyzed for denaturation temperature with 
the accompanying DSC ~;oftware. A hermetic pan filled with EFW was used as a reference. 
6.2.5 Heparin Stability 
Release of free reparin from the collagen gels was examined in order to assess the 
stability of the immobilized heparin. Hydrated collagen gels were immersed in PBS (pH 7.4) 
and shaken in a waterbath, at 37°C. Samples were taken hourly for the first 8 hours, then 
twice daily for 2 days, then once on the fourth day and finally once on the seventh day. 
Samples were stored at 4°C prior to analysis for heparin concentration using the toluidine 
blue assay (Macintosh. 1941; Smith, Mallia, and Hermanson. 1980).

6.2.6 	 Toluidine Blue Assay 
In a 5 mL test tube, 1.5 mL of sample or standard heparin solution (0-2 J.Lg/mL 
heparin in 0.2% sodium chloride (NaCl)) and 0.15 mL of toluidine blue solution (0.005% 
toluidine blue dye with 0.2% NaCl and 0.01 N HCl) were combined. The test tubes were 
vortexed for 30 seconds and 1 mL n-hexane added. The mixture was then shaken for an 
additional 30 seconds. The solution was allowed to phase separate, after which the aqueous 
layer was removed and analyzed at 630 nm. Sample absorbance values were standardized 
against known standard heparin solutions and heparinized gels were standardized against 
their non-heparin gel counterparts. 
6.2.7 	Dendrimer Stability 
Dendrimer reactivity with and release from the collagen matrix was assessed by 
analyzing release samples with a Coomasie blue assay (Bradford. 1976; Sapan, Lundblad, 
and Price. 1999). Although this assay is primarily used for protein quantification, through 
protein-dye interactions, its use was extended here, as a crude means of detecting changes in 
pH. Alkaline substance:; have been shown to interfere with the dye absorbance, through a 
conversion from the cal:ionic to the neutral to the anionic form of the dye, causing an 
absorbance shift at 595nm (Stoscheck. 1990). Heparin was not shown to interfere with the 
dye, consistent with Bradford's observations of non-interfering carbohydrates (Bradford. 
1976). 
A release study was performed similar to the heparin stability release, whereby 
hydrated collagen surfaces were immersed in PBS (pH 7.4), shaken at 37°C and sampled 
periodically. 200 J.LL ofthe release sample, in triplicate, was pipetted into a 96-well plate and 
mixed with 100 J.LL of Coomassie blue solution (50.1 mg Coomassie blue dye powder 
-125­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
dissolved in 25 mL 95% ethanol and 50 mL 85% 0-phosphoric acid and 500 mL Milli-Q 
water). After 5 minutes, the samples were read at 595 nm and subsequent absorbencies were 
compared against standa~d curves of known dendrimer concentrations in PBS. 
6.2.8 1251 Labelled FGF-2 Immobilization 
FGF-2 was recollstituted in tris (hydroxymethyl) methylamine (TRIS) buffer (pH 
7.4), and radiolabelled via the IODOGEN method (Pierce, USA) (Klenkler et al. 2005). 
Growth factor (100 ~-tL) was combined with 5 ~-tL of 1251 (500 ~-tCu I 5 ~-tL) in an lodogen 
coated vial and stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature. The solution was subsequently 
dialyzed 3 times with TRIS buffer over a 24 hour period. Free unbound isotope amount was 
determined by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. Collagen gels were soaked in 5 mL 
EFW for 24 hrs to remove any unbound heparin and dendrimer, freeze dried, and exposed to 
1251 labelled FGF-2 to assess FGF-2 immobilization through radioactivity, read on a gamma 
counter (Wallac Wizard 3" 1480 Automatic Gamma Counter, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). 
To determine FGF-2 adsorption, surfaces were rinsed three times in TRIS for 1 min, dabbed 
dry and read for activity. 
6.2.9 1251 Labelled FG F -2 Release Studies 
Radioactive gels were placed into 1 mL fresh TRIS buffer, in a 37°C shaking 
waterbath. Release samples were obtained at regular intervals in order to determine the FGF­
2 release profile. Surfa~;e and sample radioactivity were measured with a gamma counter 
(Wallac Wizard 3" 1480 Automatic Gamma Counter, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) and 
translated to known concentrations of 1251labelled FGF-2.

6.3 RESULTS AND HISCUSSION 
6.3.1 Collagen Gel Fa l>rication 
Thermally and chemically crosslinked collagen gels containing heparin were 
prepared, as were contra 1 gels containing no heparin. Two chemical cross linking solutions 
were used, the first containing EDC/NHS, while the second solution was variations of EDC 
and NHS combined witL dendrimer. Thermally crosslinked collagen gels required a pH of 
7.4 to gel, while EDC/NHS crosslinking has been reported to be optimal at pH 5.5, as this 
enables carboxylic acid groups to be functionalized efficiently with EDC (Olde Damink et al. 
1996). 
The appearance <md relative strength of collagen gels are presented in Table 6-1. 
Thermally crosslinking collagen gels with or without heparin were opaque in appearance. It 
has been observed by M~Pherson eta!. that opacity increases with increasing low levels of 
heparin (5-20 J.lglmg ccllagen) but a saturation point is achieved (>160 J.lg heparin/mg 
collagen) with no further opacity effects (McPherson et al. 1988). The transparency of pure 
collagen gels tended to improve with the addition ofchemical crosslinkers but the addition of 
heparin led to more op:tque gels. Heparin influences collagen fibrillogenesis, whereby 
increasing heparin concentrations disrupts fibril assembly and increases collagen fibril 
diameter resulting in greater opacity (McPherson et al. 1988). In this work, the concentration 
of heparin added to the gels was quite high at 204 J.lg heparin/mg collagen. Thus the 
-127­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
occurrence of opacity is not unexpected. For TECE applications, optimization of the heparin 
concentration is required for transparent implants.

The relative mec aanical strength can be attributed to interactions between carboxyl 
acid and amine groups either present on the collagen molecule itself, or between collagen and 
the introduced chemical erosslink:ers. Thermally gelled collagen (COLL) matrix formation is 
mediated by fibril hydro phobic and electrostatic forces, whose interactions are stabilized at 
higher temperatures (30-37°C) (Rosenblatt, Devereux, and Wallace. 1993; Wallace. 1990). 
At room temperature, pue collagen gels become more fluid, resulting in the more delicate 
surface observed here. Heparinized collagen thermal gels (C-H) had a slight increase in 
relative strength, as hepain influences the generation of larger diameter fibrils, which may 
affect gel stability (McPherson et al. 1988). 
Relative mechaniGal strength of collagen gels was greatly improved with the addition 
of chemical crosslink:en; as expected. The crosslink:ing of collagen facilitated by the 
EDC/NHS mixture (C-EDC) allows for "zero-length" direct covalent crosslink:s between 
collagen fibrils (Grabare.( and Gergely. 1990). This occurs through the formation of stable 
-128­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
amide bonds through Cclrboxylic acid side groups, specifically glutamic and aspartic acid, 
binding to lysine groups (Olde Damink et al. 1996). Crosslinking collagen with G2 
dendrimer (C-G2), further increased relative mechanical strength, as the limited amine 
groups available for cro:;slinking are amplified by the presence of the G2 dendrimer (Duan 
and Sheardown. 2005). No difference in relative mechanical strength was observed with 
increasing crosslinking amounts of C-20%G2 and C-2G2. There was no noticeable 
difference in strength between heparinized chemically crosslinked collagen matrices and 
their control counterpart~;. However, the addition of heparin to the collagen solution prior to 
crosslinker addition could result in the activation of heparin carboxylic acid groups, 
rendering them capable cf amide bonding to the collagen fibrils or to the G2 dendrimer. 
6.3.2 Water uptake 
Water uptake, shown in Figure 6-1, was determined from dry and wet weights of 
freeze dried and re-hydrated collagen surfaces, respectively. Swelling can be loosely 
correlated to gel crosslinking as electrostatic and hydrophobic forces affect porosity and fiber 
rigidity, both of which influence water uptake (Rosenblatt, Devereux, and Wallace. 1993; 
Wallace. 1990). Therm1lly crosslinked collagen gels had unusually moderate swelling at 
only 86%, whereas previous work has demonstrated higher values near 100% (Duan and 
Sheardown. 2005). This difference could be due to dehydration methods, whereby collagen 
was freeze-dried prior to reswelling, since the surface appeared discoloured and of irregular 
shape (compared to other more disc like surfaces), which was not recovered upon reswelling. 
Also, the soaking time of 1 hr may not have been enough for these surfaces to adequately 
rehydrate. 
-129­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
Water uptake increased significantly (p = 0.0001) in thermal gels to 97% with the 
addition of heparin, which can be attributed to the increased porosity of a less uniform 
cohesive matrix fabricated when heparin interferes with collagen fibril formation (Guidry 
and Grinnell. 1987). Tb ere is a high affinity receptor for heparin on the collagen molecule 
(Keller, Keller, and Kuhn. 1986) and heparin can interact with positively charges groups on 
collagen, but heparin binding does not do so uniformly in vitro, which can create a poorly 
crosslinked collagen matrix.

Figure 6-1. Solvent uptake of collagen modified materials. Thermally crosslinked gels 
had surprisingly low swelling, while heparinized thermal gels had higher swelling, 
indicative of a weakt: r matrix. Chemical crosslinking with EDC/NHS and its 
heparinized counterpart has increased crosslinking respectively, similar to dendrimer 
crosslinked gels crosslinked with or without heparin. 
-130­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
The use of a chemical crosslinker did not significantly decrease the water uptake of 
these gels. However, in most cases, the addition of heparin either the swelling, suggesting 
that heparin was also participating in the crosslinking reaction, and did not affect the water 
uptake. Consistent heparin incorporation may be possible by activating with EDC/NHS prior 
to combining with the collagen solution. Significantly (p = 0.03) lower water uptake was 
observed with the addition of heparin to the EDC/NHS crosslinked gels (C-EDC versus C-H­
EDC). Heparinized G2 dendrimer crosslinked collagen gels had swelling capabilities similar 
to their unheparinized counterparts, indicating similar crosslinking. In these gels, heparin, 
through EDC/NHS activation, would be able to bind to collagen and dendrimer, creating a 
highly complex but stabl':! mesh network. 
Water uptake trerrds observed by Duan and Sheardown for unheparinized collagen 
surfaces showed swelling increasing with decreasing crosslinking, with crosslinking in the 
order of Coll < C-EDC < C-G2 (Duan and Sheardown. 2005). The discrepancy seen here 
may be due to the small size of the surfaces weighed; it may be worthwhile to reexamine 
water uptake using larger surfaces and soaking the materials for longer time periods. 
6.3.3 Differential Scanning Colorimetry 
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been routinely used to assess 
crosslinking stability of collagen materials (Figueiro et al. 2006; Lee et al. 1995). Hydrated 
collagen surfaces were {:xposed to a temperature range of 5 to 1 00°C at a heating rate of 
2°C/min and the corresponding denaturation temperatures for collagen gels are shown in 
Figure 6-2.

Figure 6-2. Denaturation temperatures of collagen surfaces. Thermally crosslinked 
gels had lower denaturation temperatures, while chemically crosslinked gels 
demonstrated higher s1 ability through higher denaturation temperatures. Values are 
the mean with standard error. 
Multiple denaturation temperatures have been observed for fibrillar collagen, those 
below 50°C and thos{: slightly above 50°C, representing non-fibrillar and fibrillar 
components, respectivel~r (Wallace et al. 1986). In this work, the collagen denaturation 
temperature was calculated as the average temperature needed to denature both fibrillar and 
non-fibrillar components. Thermally crosslinked collagen gels had a denaturation 
temperature of 53°C, which decreased significantly (p = 0.02) to 49°C with heparinization, 
providing further evidence ofheparin fibril interference towards gel stability. 
-132­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
EDC/NHS cros~;linked collagen gels with and without heparin had higher 
denaturation temperatur<;s, 81 °C and 84°C, respectively. With the addition of G2 dendrimer 
crosslinker, the denaturation temperature of the gels increased further to near 90°C, 
indicating increased crosslinking and stability. Differences were insignificant (p > 0.05) 
between collagen gels and their heparinized counterparts. Previously observed denaturation 
temperatures of unheparinized thermally and chemically crosslinked collagen gels were 
comparable to the values seen here (Duan and Sheardown. 2005; Wissink, M. J. B. et al. 
2001). 
Interestingly, many collagen crosslinked gels had numerous denaturation 
temperatures; these are summarized in Table 6-2. Referred to earlier, collagen has two 
denaturation temperatur<;s due to non-fibrillar and fibrillar components, and these can be 
attributed to the lower denaturation temperatures seen here. Moderate temperatures, similar 
in value to C-EDC's det1aturation temperature could represent denaturation of chemically 
crosslinked collagen fibr[ls. Heparin integration via EDC/NHS activation resulted in direct 
heparin-collagen binding, whose denaturation may be represented at 73°C, as seen as a 
denaturation peak in C-H-EDC gels.

The lower dem.turation temperatures in dendrimer crosslinked collagen could 
represent collagen fibrils, and their binding through EDC/NHS. There was evidence of 
multiple high temperatu~e denaturation peaks, averaged in the data shown here, that could 
represent complex and heterogeneous dendrimer interactions with collagen, whereby 
dendrimer can bind completely to collagen, or partially through its 8 reactive amine groups. 
Further peaks were noted with heparinized dendrimer gels, likely attributable to various 
heparin interactions within the collagen and dendrimer matrix. To verify the integrity of 
denaturation temperatures, DSC was performed again on the surfaces, as collagen 
degradation is an irreversible process. Denaturation peaks noted in the first scan were not 
present in the second scan. 
6.3.4 Heparin Release From and Stability within the Gels 
Heparin stability within the heparinized collagen gels was assessed by incubating 
surfaces under physiological conditions and periodically quantifying heparin concentrations 
of withdrawn samples via a modified version of the toluidine blue assay. A calibration curve 
was created from kno~n heparin concentrations in PBS, while heparinized gels were 
normalized against their unheparinized counterparts. Heparin release profiles are shown in 
Figure 6-3. 
Initially all heparin gels were fabricated to contain 119.2 Jlg. Heparin released with 
decreasing collagen crcsslinking, which thermally gelled heparinized collagen (C-H) 
releasing 35% of heparin, followed by 24% heparin released from EDC/NHS crosslinked 
gels (C-H-EDC), and 18%, 16% and 6% heparin released from G2 dendrimer gels, C-H-G2, 
-134­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
C-H-20%G2, and C-H-:~G2, respectively. The data indicate that activation of heparin by 
EDC/NHS allows for beparin binding to the collagen fibrils or G2 dendrimer, and that 
increasing EDC/NHS and G2 dendrimer amounts allows for greater heparin integration. The 
variability in the amount of heparin released observed with heparinized chemically 
crosslinked gels is likely due to the possible heterogeneity of collagen binding.

Figure 6-3. Heparin release profiles of collagen surfaces. Higher degrees of 
crosslinking were able to immobilize more heparin, with thermal gel releasing the most 
heparin (36%). 
It would be inkresting to manipulate the amount of EDC/NHS and dendrimer 
required for controlled heparin immobilization and delivery, as the addition of heparin to 
release mediums has in~;reased FGF-2 release and enhanced growth factor stability once 
released (Edelman et al. 1991 ). In fact, it may be beneficial to allow the release of heparin­
-135­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
FGF-2 complexes early in wound healing applications to ensure cellular activation if 
extracellular matrix proteoglycan concentrations are low. 
The amount of immobilized heparin could also potentially be increased by adding 
heparin to the EDC/NHS mixture, allowing for full carboxyl activation and greater 
probability of reaction with collagen. Furthermore, pre-reaction with the G2 dendrimer, as in 
previous work, may als·) be desirable as it would provide dendrimer heparin complexes; 
however optimization would be required to ensure maximum crosslinking without 
compromising stability. 
6.3.5 G2 Dendrimer Stability 
There is controversial data surrounding dendrimer toxicity, whereby cationic 
dendrimers induce toxicity, through cell membrane lysis and accumulate in the liver (Boas 
and Heegaard. 2004; Gillies and Frechet. 2005). Dendrimer immobilization will also result 
in stronger collagen matrices for the desired TECE applications. For these reasons, 
dendrimer stability was assessed by monitoring changes in pH with the Coomassie blue 
assay, as pH adjusts th~ metachromatic absorbance of the dye (Stoscheck. 1990). To 
eliminate side effects of collagen degradation over the release time, collagen gels without 
dendrimer were also monitored. Results are presented in Figure 6-4. 
The collagen gel, its heparinized counterpart, and C-H-EDC did not appear to 
interfere with the coomassie assay. Dendrimer crosslinked collagen, C-G2, C-20%G2 and C­
2G2 did release < 10% of their dendrimer, which released within the first 2-3 hours. 
Approximately 20% of rhe original dendrimer amount was released in a similarly rapid 
fashion from C-H-G2 and C-H-20%G2 gels. Both of these gels had equal amounts of 
-136­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
EDC/NHS, which may not be adequate for both heparin and collagen activation for complete 
dendrimer incorporation. This is further supported by the C-H-202 gel, which released less 
than 5%, as the gel was activated with a larger amount of EDC/NHS. Extensive rinsing of 
the dendrimer crosslinked gels would eliminate the risk of leaching dendrimer during further 
experimentation.

crosslinked gels relea~ ed dendrimer (20% ), while their unheparinized counterparts 
released much less {<10%). However, C-H-G2 had increased dendrimer stability, 
perhaps attributable to an increased concentration of EDC/NHS, which likely 
accommodates chemicHl activation of both collagen and heparin. 
6.3.6 1251 Labelled FGF -2 Immobilization

factor that remained after rinsing three times with TRIS buffer.

Figure 6-5. Immobiliz£d FGF-2 to collagen surfaces before and after rinsing with TRIS 
buffer. Thermally crosslinked gels, with and without heparin, had lower FGF-2 
immobilization, likely attributable to matrix porosity and instability. Chemically 
crosslinked gels had comparable immobilization. 
On average, an approximate loss of 25% 1251-FGF-2 from all surfaces was observed 
after rinsing with TRIS buffer, and retention did not differ greatly between surfaces (p = 
0.21). 
Collagen therma: gels immobilized ~ 300 ng of FGF-2 after rinsing, which can be 
attributed not only to absorption into the dried gel, but also to the growth factor binding 
domains on the collagen molecule (Kanematsu et al. 2004a). C-H gels immobilized less 
-138­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
FGF-2 (p = 0.005) likely due to the gel's loose fibril arrangement and poor heparin retention. 
EDC/NHS crosslinked gels, with (p = 0.036) or without heparin (p = 0.002), resulted in 
higher FGF-2 immobilization. Dendrimer crosslinked gels did not differ significantly from 
COLL or EDC/NHS cro:;slinked gels, presumably due to the increase in heparin binding and 
a decrease in collagen domains for FGF-2 binding. 
6.3.7 	1251 Labelled FGF-2 Release Studies 
Release of the usi-FGF-2 from collagen based gels, into TRIS buffer at 37°C, is 
shown in Figures 6-6 and 6-7 for the first 26 days of release. As expected, release ofFGF-2 
for all collagen gels begc:.n with an initial burst ofFGF-2 followed by first order release.

Figure 6-7. FGF-2 rel1~ased from G2 dendrimer crosslinked collagen surfaces, with or 
without heparin, crosslinked with various amounts of crosslinking solutions. 
Over a 2 week period, 20-60% of the incorporated FGF-2 was released from the gels, 
with higher percentages being released from the dendrimer gels with high initial loadings. 
The large error bars see1 with dendrimer crosslinked gels may be attributable to differences 
in FGF-2 retention, perhaps influenced by crosslinking variability and heparin availability. It 
is unknown what releast:: rates will be necessary to stimulate corneal stromal cells. However, 
given that the relative loading differed by a factor of more than two, it is reasonable to 
hypothesize that different release rates could be obtained. Future work will focus on the 
effect of the released growth factor on corneal stromal cells. Furthermore, despite the 
promising release of FGF-2 from collagen gels, either thermally or chemically crosslinked, 
there is evidence of growth factor instability when released without heparin (Edelman et al. 
-140­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
1991). Thus there is a high probability that FGF-2 incorporated in the matrix and later 
released may be rapidly :lenatured, and studies of this nature are ongoing. Heparin added to 
the release medium has also shown to influence release rates (Liu et al. 2002), and since 
glycosaminoglycan prod1ction is augmented during wound healing (Hassell et al. 1983), that 
would also be worth invt:stigating. 
Collagen matrict:s crosslinked with gluteraldehyde demonstrated sustained FGF-2 
release, but this was also affected by matrix degradation (Kanematsu et al. 2004b). Other 
collagen delivery systems for other heparin-binding growth factors, TGF-P (Schroeder-Tefft, 
Bentz, and Estridge. 1997) and VEGF (Steffens et al. 2004), have also shown promise for 
tissue engineering. 
Heparinized collagen crosslinked with EDC/NHS has been developed by Wissink et 
al. for vascular graft applications (Wissink et al. 2001). They observed FGF-2 
immobilization of 22% ::>f the original FGF-2 solution and released 40% FGF-2 in 28 days. 
Research by Pieper et ai. demonstrated increased angiogenesis with FGF-2 incorporated into 
EDC/NHS crosslinked collagen gels (Pieper et al. 2002). 
6.4 CONCLUSIONS 
Heparinized collagen surfaces were gelled thermally and chemically through 
EDC/NHS activation and dendrimer crosslinking. Heparinized thermal gels demonstrated a 
loose, unstable matrix, indicated by the high swelling, low denaturation temperature, 
increased heparin instability and decreased FGF-2 immobilization. 
Combination of heparin with EDC/NHS allowed for its covalent immobilization 
within the collagen mabx. Surfaces had increased stability, compared to thermal gels, with 
-141 ­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
moderate swelling, improved crosslinking, evident from the high denaturation temperature of 
84°C, and only had 25% unbound heparin. 
Further addition of G2 dendrimers to the EDC/NHS crosslinked gels resulted in 
materials with very moderate swelling and high denaturation temperatures. These materials 
allowed for increased heparin retention, provided the amount of crosslinker was adequate to 
activate both heparin ani collagen fibrils for dendrimer incorporation, as was the case with 
C-H-2G2. 
FGF-2 immobilization was comparable with all chemically crosslinked gels, and 
release ofFGF-2 was in a first order profile resulting in approximately 20-60% released over 
2 weeks, depending on crosslinking densities. Thus, these surfaces would be adequate for 
wound healing applications, through their FGF-2 delivery. However for the application of 
TECEs, more optimizati em ofheparin integration and matrix stability are required.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
7.1 Conclusions 
Two materials types, commonly used for ophthalmic applications and currently under 
investigation for use in artificial cornea applications, were investigated; PDMS based 
materials for a keratoprc sthetic devices and dendrimer crosslinked collagen gels for use as a 
tissue engineered corneal equivalent. 
The two methodologies, direct and indirect modification, were successful for PDMS­
PEO-heparin fabrication. However, direct modification method showed batch variation and 
highly reactive surfaces were difficult to reproduce, while indirect modification resulted in 
frequent surface damage and platinum poisoning but is generally thought to be more 
promising and overall smpler to perform. Heparin densities on the order of 1 J..Lg/cm2 were 
obtained, with uniform PEO coverage, and surface bound heparin was active. High levels of 
FGF-2 could be immob[lized for subsequent release. Heparinized PDMS modified surfaces 
soaked for 1 or 3 days released 7.5% (over 20 days) and 50% (over 5 days), respectively, of 
initially immobilized FGF-2, indicating that slow and gradual release was possible. 
Heparinized collagen crosslinked with EDC/NHS and G2 dendrimer were created. 
Surfaces demonstrated moderate swelling and high denaturation temperatures. These 
materials allowed for ilcreased heparin retention, provided the amount of crosslinker was 
adequate to activate beth heparin and collagen fibrils for dendrimer incorporation. FGF-2 
immobilization was successful with release reaching 30% over 11 days. 
Thus these materials have potential for the delivery of FGF-2 in corneal wound 
healing and artificial cornea applications. 
-148­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University -Chemical Engineering 
7.2 	Recommendation:; 
Large variabilit) was seen on the PDMS-PEO-HEP and PDMS-PEO-LMWH 
surfaces, attributable to 1:he high variability of PEO bound to the surface and its subsequent 
reaction to heparin. Thus further optimization of these reaction mechanisms are required to 
decrease surface dama~;e, decrease variability, and ensure consistent heparinization and 
subsequent FGF-2 delivery. 
Heparinized collagen gels crosslinked with dendrimer require optimization of 
reaction kinetics, while considering heparin integration, and subsequent transparency, and 
overall matrix stability Further work in this area should involve investigating heparin 
activation with EDC/NHS prior to combining with the collagen solution. Furthermore, pre­
reaction with the 02 deLdrimer as in previous work may also be desirable as it would provide 
dendrimer heparin complexes; however optimization would be required to ensure maximum 
crosslinking without compromising stability. 
Finally, maintenance of FGF-2 activity during release is of crucial importance. 
Although in vitro cell stimulation of released FGF-2 was not performed, there is evidence of 
FGF-2 instability when released without heparin (Edelman et al. 1991). Non-heparinized 
surfaces that adsorbed or bind FGF-2 are likely to have adsorbed and released denatured 
protein, incapable of stimulating the desired wound healing response. Thus the soluble FGF­
2 release with heparin seen here is more likely to maintain FGF-2 activity. It is 
recommended that in vitro studies with fibroblast cells be performed to assess FGF-2 activity 
and the efficacy ofthese delivery systems. 
Also of interest is the presence of heparin in release medium and its ability to increase 
release and stabilizing FGF-2 further (Liu et al. 2002). It would be noteworthy to conduct 
-149­Masters Thesis -M. A. Princz McMaster University- Chemical Engineering 
release studies of that nature, to better predict in vivo release, as there is increased 
glycosaminoglycan production during corneal wound healing (Hassell et al. 1983) and the 
presence of free heparin is likely. In the case of heparinized collagen matrices, it may be 
beneficial to allow an initial release of heparin to facilitate FGF-2 stability and translocation.
