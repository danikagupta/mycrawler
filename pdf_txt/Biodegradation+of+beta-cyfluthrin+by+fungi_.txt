Pyrethroids are broad-spectrum insecticides and presence of chiral carbon differentiates
among various forms of pyrethroids. Microbial approaches have emerged as a popular
solution to counter pyrethroid toxicity to marine life and mammals. Bacterial and fungal
strains can effectively degrade pyrethroids into non-toxic compounds. Different strains
of bacteria and fungi such as Bacillus spp., Raoultella ornithinolytica, Psudomonas
ﬂourescens ,Brevibacterium sp., Acinetobactor sp., Aspergillus sp., Candida sp.,
Trichoderma sp., and Candia spp., are used for the biodegradation of pyrethroids.
Hydrolysis of ester bond by enzyme esterase/carboxyl esterase is the initial step in
pyrethroid biodegradation. Esterase is found in bacteria, fungi, insect and mammalian
liver microsome cells that indicates its hydrolysis ability in living cells. Biodegradation
pattern and detected metabolites reveal microbial consumption of pyrethroids as carbon
and nitrogen source. In this review, we aim to explore pyrethroid degrading strains,
enzymes and metabolites produced by microbial strains. This review paper covers in-
depth knowledge of pyrethroids and recommends possible solutions to minimize their
environmental toxicity.

INTRODUCTION
Pyrethroids are the most commonly used global pesticides. Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium
ﬂowers are the natural source of pyrethroids and allethrin was developed as the ﬁrst synthetic
pyrethroid insecticide in 1949 (Ensley, 2018; Gammon et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019). Pyrethroids
can be divided into two groups, type I pyrethroids containing basic cyclopropane carboxylic
(e.g., allethrin) and type II pyrethroids containing cyano group (Proudfoot, 2005; Wolansky and
Harrill, 2008; Chang et al., 2016; Figure 1 ). Presence of cyano group in type II pyrethroids enhances
their insecticidal properties as compared to type I pyrethroids. All pyrethroids contain at least
four stereoisomers, which exhibit diﬀerent biological activities ( Table 1 ). Pyrethroids are either
marketed as racemic mixture of stereoisomers or single chemical isomer. Piperonyl butoxide acts as
synergist in commercial formulation of pyrethroids and inhibits the metabolic degradation of active
compounds (Bradberry et al., 2005; Fai et al., 2017). Deltamethrin is used in diﬀerent countries
to control malaria-spreading mosquitoes. Pyrethroids are reported to be 2250 times more toxic
to insect than mammals and disrupt sodium, chloride channels (Chrustek et al., 2018). At high
concentrations pyrethroids inhibit the functioning of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) gated

chloride ion channel (Bradberry et al., 2005; Gammon et al.,
2019). Pyrethroids are mainly used to control insect pests of
agriculture, horticulture, forestry and household. Pyrethroids are
considered comparatively safe but their extensive use makes
them harmful for humans and animals (Kuivila et al., 2012;
Burns and Pastoor, 2018; Bordoni et al., 2019). Previous reports
have concluded their detrimental eﬀects on non-target species
including marine ﬁsh and aquatic insects (Burns and Pastoor,
2018; Lu et al., 2019). Pyrethroid toxicity biomarkers have
been well documented in ﬁsh (Ullah et al., 2019). Frequent
pyrethroids applications in agriculture and households can cause
inappropriate eﬀects on human growth. In humans, pyrethroids
exposure leads to contaminated urine, low serum quality,
and antiandrogenic activity. Bio-absorption of pyrethroids was
detected in the urine samples of outdoor workers in California
(Sullivan et al., 2019), which indicates the importance of this
topic. In rats, the developmental of bifenthrin neurotoxicity
was reported as mixed type (typeI/II) (Gammon et al., 2019)
whereas non-target neurotoxicity of pyrethroids has also been
investigated in zebraﬁsh (Paravani et al., 2017; Awoyemi et al.,
2019; Strungaru et al., 2019).
Microbial system is considered suitable for the biodegradation
of synthetic pyrethroids (Bhatt et al., 2019a). Most of the previous
work about pyrethroids is based on bacterial degradation.
Bacterial strains from the genera Bacillus ,Pseudomonas ,
Raoultella, Achromobacter ,Acidomonas ,Brevibacterium ,
Pseudomonas ,Streptomyces ,Serratia ,Sphingobium ,Clostridium,Klebsiella , and Lysinibacillus have been characterized for
pyrethroid degradation (Cyco ´n and Piotrowska-Seget, 2016;
Birolli et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019). Fungi also
have the potential to degrade wide variety of pesticides (Maqbool
et al., 2016). Only a few groups of fungi including Aspergillus
niger ,Aspergillus terricola ,Trichoderma viridae ,Phaenerochaete
chrysosporium (Saikia and Gopal, 2004; Deng et al., 2015), Candia
pelliculosa (Chen et al., 2012c), and Cladosporium sp. (Chen et al.,
2011b) have been reported for pyrethroid biodegradation (Birolli
et al., 2018). Fungi have been found to possess comparatively
better pesticide degradation potential than bacteria (Bhatt, 2019;
Gangola et al., 2019). Many researchers have predicted pyrethroid
degradation metabolites and pathways. A few metabolites are
common among all pyrethroids, which are used as metabolic
markers (such as 3-phenoxybenzoic acid) during microbial
degradation. Esterase enzymes are often studied for pyrethroid
degradation, due to their presence in bacteria, fungi, insect, and
human tissues (Liu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Bai et al.,
2019). Diﬀerent genes with complete open reading frames coding
pyrethroid hydrolase/esterase enzymes have been reported in
bacterial strains (Hu et al., 2019; Y ang et al., 2019).
Previous studies have concluded that microbial cultures
can eﬃciently remove pyrethroids from the environment.
In this review, we have attempted to compile the related
information about the toxicity and microbial degradation of
pyrethroid insecticides.
HAZARDOUS EFFECTS OF
PYRETHROIDS
Toxicity studies have revealed several eﬀects of pyrethroids on
human and marine life ( Table 2 ). Large-scale application of
pyrethroids aﬀects humans and animals. Indoor pyrethroids
exposure studies revealed low levels of pyrethroids absorption
in biological and environmental samples (Ghazouani et al.,
2019). Measurement of absorbed daily dose (ADD) from
biological samples is more reliable than environmental samples
(Williams et al., 2003). Cyﬂuthrin studies on a medium pile
of nylon carpet suggested that pyrethroids were absorbed
in the surrounding surfaces and were also found in human
urine samples (Williams et al., 2003; Sullivan et al., 2019).
Presence of 4-ﬂuro-3 phenoxybenzoic acid in urine samples
indicated human exposure to pyrethroids and environmental
measurements further conﬁrmed the results (Williams et al.,
2003). Studies on pyrethroid residues in children diaper revealed
that pyrethroid metabolites were stable on the diaper up to
72 h (Hu et al., 2004). Pyrethroid residues have been reported
in dust, cloth, union suit samples, diaper, military uniform,
and urine samples (Bradman et al., 2007; Proctor et al.,
2019). Pyrethroid residues in the urine samples of pregnant
women have been reported from Jiangsu China and France
(Qi et al., 2012; Dereumeaux et al., 2018; Kamai et al., 2019).
Children in United States are more exposed to pyrethroids
as compared to organic food taking children of other areas.
Pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde was commonly
found in the urine samples of exposed children (Lu et al., 2009;

Dalsager et al., 2019). Presence of 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde
metabolite in the semen of Japanese males suggested that
their semen quality was decreased by pyrethroids (Toshima
et al., 2012). Residues of organophosphorous and pyrethroids
were also reported in Australian preschool children (Babina
et al., 2012) and urinary concentration of pyrethroids from
Queensland (Australia) pre-schoolers correlated with the age
and sex (Li et al., 2019). Pyrethroids are also used to disinfect
the aircrafts and presences of 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde in the
urine samples of ﬂight attendants (18–65 years old) clearly
indicated pyrethroid exposure in diﬀerent age groups of humans
(Wei et al., 2012). Higher pyrethroids exposure was reported in
farmers and consumers of northern Thailand (Hongsibsong et al.,
2019) and extensive studies revealed their carcinogenic potential
(Navarrete-Meneses and Pérez-Vera, 2019).
Macrophages are immune cells that play important role
in pathogen removal from the cells. It was observed that
b-cypermethrin and cyhalothrin treatment decreased phagocytic
activity and nitric oxide production in macrophage cells (He
et al., 2019). No activity was detected at low concentration
of cyhalothrin whereas macrophage activity was blocked at
higher concentration. Direct eﬀect of cyhalothrin on macrophagecells is due to the activity of sodium ion membrane channels
whereas activity of hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis caused
indirect eﬀects in rats (Righi and Palermo-Neto, 2005; He
et al., 2019). Diﬀerent levels of pyrethroid toxicity in freshwater
invertebrates Ceriodephnia dubia and Daphnia magna is due
to a selective enantiomer in racemate (Liu et al., 2005).
Comparative study of cyﬂuthrin and chlorpyrifos toxicity in
human fetal astrocytes (star shaped glial cells in the brain
and spinal cord) revealed that cyﬂuthrin exerts more toxic
eﬀects on survival, growth and proper functioning of human
peripheral lymphocytes, and induces apoptosis (Mense et al.,
2006; Segura et al., 2018). Cyﬂuthrin and chlorpyrifos over
express pro-inﬂammatory mediators, and cyﬂuthrin can cause
mutation to change chromosome number (Mense et al., 2006;
Muzinic et al., 2018). Genotoxic and cytotoxic eﬀects of
cyﬂuthrin were detected by Salmonella/mammalian microsome
mutagenicity test, chromosomal aberration, chromatid exchange,
and micronucleus formation in cultured human peripheral
blood lymphocytes in vitro (Ila et al., 2008; Chalap et al.,
2018). Pyrethroid genotoxicity demands for their restricted
use around children, elderly people, and pregnant women
(Kocaman and Topakta¸ s, 2009).

Bhatt et al. Microbial Degradation of Pyrethroids
Pyrethroids are neurotoxic pesticides and aﬀect neurotrans-
mitters (Gammon et al., 2019). Eﬀect of low acute oral
dose of pyrethroids has been investigated in small rodents.
Neurobehavioral study suggested that pyrethroids block sodium
chloride and GABA channels, which inhibit transfer of
neurotransmitters between cells (Cao et al., 2011; Richardson
et al., 2019). Permethrin was reported against Laccophilus
minutus (Touylia et al., 2019) and in humans it is absorbed
through dermal and non-dietary entry points (Nakagawa
et al., 2019). Cypermethrin, allethrin, cis/trans permethrin and
deltamethrin modiﬁed the strength and behavior of tested
organisms, whereas decreased grip strength was noted after
pyrethrum, cypermethrin, bifenthrin, b-cyﬂuthrin, deltamethrin,
S-bioallethrin, and permethrin treatments. A coordination study
of deltamethrin and a-cypermethrin with rotarod revealed that
the compound with a-cyano group enhanced acoustic evoked
startle response amplitude whereas opposite eﬀect was observed
without a-cyano group. Intensity of tremor and sensory response
is rarely explored against pyrethroids (Wolansky and Harrill,
2008). Ansari et al. (2012) reported that long term exposure of
l-cypermethrin produces harmful neurochemical endpoints that
cause behavioral variations in rats.
Antiandrogenic activity of cyﬂuthrin and b-cyﬂuthrin in
a carcinogenic cell line MDA-kb2 has also been reported
(Zhang et al., 2008). Bifenthrin evokes various toxicological
eﬀects in diﬀerent human cells by modifying homeostasis
and cell viability in human prostate cancer cells (Chien
et al., 2019). Bifenthrin acts as endocrine disrupting chemical
by inhibiting the expression of glucocorticoid and estrogen
receptor (Ligocki et al., 2019). 5-Dihydrotestosterone induced
androgen receptor activity was blocked by pyrethroids in
MDA-kb2 cells and considered as moderate antiandrogenic
(Zhang et al., 2008). Giddings et al. (2009) compared the
eﬀect of g-cyhalothrin and l-cyhalothrin, and suggested that
the single active enantiomer (isomer) causes more toxicity
than racemic mixture of both pyrethroids in marine ﬁsh and
invertebrates (Giddings et al., 2009). Lambda-cyhalothrin and
fenvalerate decreased triiodothyronine (T3) in the embryo of
Zebra ﬁsh ( Danio rerio ) (Awoyemi et al., 2019). Due to speciﬁc
binding between ER areceptor and pyrethroid isomer, synthetic
pyrethroids act as estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds
(Wang et al., 2010; Lauretta et al., 2019).
Damage of b-cypermethrin to soil microbial communities is
less as compared to marine life (Zhuang et al., 2011). Bifenthrin
aﬀects microbial community in sandy loam soil and pyrethroids
are generally considered as a threat to marine life (Sharma
and Singh, 2012). Cypermethrin and deltamethrin residues were
reported in Brinjal fruits which can be reduced by washing and
boiling before cooking (Kaur et al., 2011). Deltamethrin induced
shift of soil microorganisms was reported with cabbage plants
after 30 days of treatment (Braganaca et al., 2019). Pyrethroids
are highly toxic to aquatic organisms such as ﬁsh, shrimp, crab
and shellﬁsh. Eﬀects of g-cyhalothrin and modulator piperonyl
butoxide were observed in ﬁsh Oreochromis niloticu s. Study
revealed that l-cyhalothrin causes oxidative stress in the liver of
O. niloticus and stress was further increased in the presence of
piperonyl butoxide (Piner and Üner, 2012; Giddings et al., 2019).Pyrethroids transform into solid, liquid and gas phase and enter
in food chains to pose high health risk. Pyrethroids accumulated
in sediment are major source of aquatic toxicity (Tang et al.,
2018). Toxicity of type I and type II pyrethroids was assessed in
embryo of Zebraﬁsh ( D. rerio ) that depicted diﬀerent mechanistic
eﬀects of pyrethroids and their instability in marine environment
(Awoyemi et al., 2019). Pyrethroids toxicity to red blood cells
and brain cells is associated with physiological changes and DNA
damage in ﬁsh (Paravani et al., 2019; Ullah et al., 2019).
Cypermethrin stress decreased total glycogen content in
diﬀerent organs/tissues of Marica opima and aﬀected its
metabolic activity (Tendulkar and Kulkarni, 2012). Oxidative
stress produced by deltamethrin is one of the major mechanism
of neurotoxicity (Romero et al., 2012). Deltamethrin inhibits
the diﬀerentiation of osteoclast by regulating nuclear factor
of activated T-cells cytoplasmic-1 (NFATc-1) and oxygenase-
1 which is an important regulatory protein (Sakamoto et al.,
2012). Deltamethrin is more hazardous than biopesticide
(Bacillus thuringiensis ) and has been reported to cause testicular
injury in rats and aﬀect sex pheromones (Delpuech et al.,
2012; Ismail and Mohamed, 2012). Cypermethrin inhibits the
androgen receptor (AR) activity by disrupting AR-SRC1 (steroid
receptor coactivator-1) interaction (Pan et al., 2012). Toxicity
of pyrethroids ( cis-bifenthrin) is enantioselective in nature
and particular degrading enzymes are more expressive. These
previous studies provide detailed knowledge of chiral chemical
toxicity at molecular level (Lu, 2013). High pesticide exposure
leads to acute pesticide poisoning and damages central nervous
system (CNS) (Starks et al., 2012).
Permethrin and its four chiral isomers caused severe
histopathological testicular damage in mice at 100 mg/kg
by decreasing testis weight and concentration of testosterone
hormone (Jin et al., 2012). These pesticides have been noted
to transfer from mother to calf in dolphins via gestation and
lactation pathways (Alonso et al., 2012; Kondo et al., 2019).
Studies conducted in Brazil, Columbia and Spain reported the
presence of pyrethroids in human breast milk at concentrations
of about 1.45–24.2 ng/gm lw (Corcellas et al., 2012).
Zartarian et al. (2012) studied the eﬀects of permethrin
in 3–5 years old children. Stochastic human exposure and
dose stimulation model (SHEDS) for multimedia multi-pathway
chemicals is commonly known as multimedia computer based
method developed by environmental protection agency (EPA)
for the study of toxic chemicals (Zartarian et al., 2012).
Lambda-cypermethrin has been reported to cause reproductive
toxicity, hepatotoxicity, splenotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity in
male mice (Starks et al., 2012). Eﬀect of pyrethroids on diﬀerent
ﬁsh suggested that highly lipophilic pyrethroids accumulate
in sediments and organisms. These compounds also act as
endocrine disruptor and block the hormonal signaling in aquatic
animals and mammals (Brander et al., 2016).
A study of cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and cyhalothrin
phytotoxicity on Cucumis sativus showed that these insecticides
aﬀected the production of cholorophyll and caretonoids in
plants (Braganca et al., 2018). The study on cypermethrin
biodegradation and metabolites detection in tomato, cabbage,
rape, pepper, and cucumber revealed its rapid dissipation in

cucumber (Y ao et al., 2018).
PYRETHROID-DEGRADING
MICROORGANISMS AND THEIR
DEGRADATION CHARACTERISTICS
Many studies have conﬁrmed that bacteria and fungi are
capable of degrading pyrethroids in liquid cultures or soils
(Table 3 ). Microorganisms can degrade pyrethroids by using
either directly as a source of carbon or co-metabolically (Birolli
et al., 2016b; Cyco ´n and Piotrowska-Seget, 2016; Chen and
Zhan, 2019). Acidomonas sp. degraded more than 70% of
allethrin in 72 h as carbon and nitrogen source (Paingankar
et al., 2005). Micrococcus sp. strain CPN1 has been reported
to biodegrade and completely mineralize cypermethrin through
enzymatic cleavage of ester bond (Tallur et al., 2008; Zhao
et al., 2015). Pyrethroid degrading bacterium Sphingobium sp.
JZ-2 was isolated and characterized from activated sludge of
pyrethroid manufacturing wastewater. Strain JZ-2 eﬃciently
degraded cypermethrin, bifenthrin, and fenvalerate. Novel
pyrethroid hydrolase puriﬁed from the cell extract was strongly
inhibited by diﬀerent ions (AgC, Cu2C, Hg2C, and Zn2C)
(Guo et al., 2009). Serratia spp. strain JC1 and JCN13
eﬃciently biodegraded beta-cypermethrin due to their higher
hydrophobicity. Strain JC1 degraded 92% beta-cypermethrin
within 10 days whereas strain JCN13 degraded 89% within 4 days.
Growth conditions for better biodegradation were also optimized
through response surface methodology (RSM) and Box-Behnken
design (Zhang et al., 2010). Pyrethroid degrading bacterium
Raoultella ornithinolytica ZK4 was isolated from the soil samples
of a pesticide plant and it degraded lambda-cyhalothrin and
deltamethrin (Zhang et al., 2019). Recently 3-phenoxybenzoic
acid and other pyrethroids were degraded (96.37%) within 72 h
of treatment by using Klebsiella pneumoniae strain BPBA052
(Tang et al., 2019).
Aerobic and anaerobic soil biodegradation of pyrethroid
etofenprox was investigated in the rice ﬁelds of California.
3-Phenoxybenzoic acid, a hydrolytic product of ester bond
cleavage was not detected in any sample. Microbial population
in a ﬂooded soil (anaerobic) played role in conversion and
dissipation of etofenprox (Vasquez et al., 2011; Furihata et al.,
2019). b-Cyﬂuthrin is commonly used by Indian farmers at
Indian Agriculture Research Institute Delhi for controlling
Lepidepteran pests of Solanaceous crops. To degrade its soil
residues, Pseudomonas stutzeri was isolated, and identiﬁed using
enrichment culture technique and intermediate metabolites
were conﬁrmed according to the previous reported pathway
(Saikia et al., 2005; Birolli et al., 2019). Cyﬂuthrin degradation
by bacterium Photobacterium ganghwense was conﬁrmed by
comparative metabolomics (Wang et al., 2019). Pyrethroid
degradation capability of Ochrobacterium tritici strain pyd1 is
dependent upon the molecular structure of synthetic pyrethroids
(Wang et al., 2011). Strain pyd-1 eﬀectively degraded both,
cisand trans isomers at the same rate. Detailed metabolic
pathway of fenpropathrin biodegradation through strain pyd-1was also identiﬁed. Speciﬁc enzyme activities of pyrethroid
hydrolase, 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (PBD) dehydrogenase,
3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA) hydroxylase, 4-hydroxy-PBA
dioxygenase, and p-hydroquinone hydroxylase have been
studied in relation to pyrethroid fenpropethrin (Dehmel
et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2019). Pseudomonas
pseudoalcaligenes strain POB310 has been reported for the
degradation of 3- and 4-carboxydiphenyl ethers (Dehmel et al.,
1995). A genetically engineered strain of Pseudomonas putida
also degraded other pesticides similar to pyrethroids (Gong et al.,
2018). Anaerobic bacterium Clostridium strain ZP3 isolated
from the mixed wastewater and sludge samples degraded higher
concentrations of fenpropathrin by co-metabolic activity and
was used to analyze complex redox reaction in fenpropathrin
biodegradation (Zhang S. et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2016). Co-
metabolic biodegradation of b-cypermethrin was explored with
Bacillus licheniformis B-1 (Zhao et al., 2019). Pseudomonas
aeruginosa CH7 degraded 90% of beta-cypermethrin by
isomerization within 12 days. Bio-surfactant (rhamnolipid)
promotes the adsorption and hydrophobicity of chemical
compounds (Zhang C. et al., 2011). Neustonic and epiphytic
bacteria and their mixed cultures were noted to similarly, degrade
deltamethrin (Kalwasinska et al., 2011). Chen et al. (2012d) also
validated the cypermethrin biodegradation through Bacillus
cereus ZH-3 and S. aureus HP-S-01 cells.
Ochrobactrum anthropi strain YZ-1 is quite potent to
degrade pyrethroids. Role of bacterial esterase PytZ (606 bp)
in biodegradation without any cofactor has been conﬁrmed
(Zhai et al., 2012). Pyrethroid hydrolase of molecular weight
53 KDa was puriﬁed and characterized from A. niger strain
ZD11. Pyrethroid activity was not detected in the presence of
glucose and it indicates that pyrethroid hydrolase only expresses
in fungus after pyrethroid stress. Optimum pH for A. niger was
found to be lower than B. cereus (7.3) whereas the optimum
temperature was comparatively higher (45C) as compared to
B. cereus strain SM3 (37C). Enzyme activity inhibition by thiol
modifying enzyme (PCMB) p-chloromercuribenzoate suggested
that sufhydryl group was involved in the catalytic center of
enzyme (Liang et al., 2005). Cypermethrin reportedly caused
toxicity to human hepatocarcinoma cell line H4H7 (Sundaram
et al., 2013). Bacillus sp. helps to biodegrade cypermethrin in
soil microcosm and B. cereus MTCC 1305 has been reported to
biodegrade fenvalerate (Selvam et al., 2013). Pyrethroid toxicity
and biodegradation eﬃciency of Pseudomonas viridoﬂava has
also been thoroughly investigated (Selvam et al., 2013; Thatheyus
and Selvam, 2013). Two strains of S. marcescens DeI-1 and DeI-2,
enhanced the disappearance of cypermethrin (Cyco ´n et al., 2014).
Application of ammonium nitrate as external nitrogen at the rate
of 122.1 kg/ha 1increased cypermethrin degradation by 80%
(Xie et al., 2008). External nitrogen might accelerate microbial
metabolism in lag phase.
Metabolic and ecological potential of fungi makes them
suitable for bioremediation and waste treatment (Harms et al.,
2011). Cell free extracts of fungi are known to eﬀectively degrade
chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids (Yu et al., 2006). b-Cyhalothrin
degradation by diﬀerent fungi has been reported including
Trichoderma viridae strain 5-2, Trichoderma viridae strain 2211,

Study was followed by the extraction and identiﬁcation of major
degradation metabolites (Saikia et al., 2005; Birolli et al., 2019).
Radiolabeled (14C) permethrin was used to understand the
mechanism of pyrethroid degradation in soil and sediment.
It was observed that R-enantiomer of both trans and cis
permethrin mineralized rapidly as compared to S-enantiomer
and degradation product of cispermethrin was more persistent
in the soil environment (Qin and Gan, 2006). Enantioselective
degradation of pyrethroids was also performed at southern
California under ﬁeld condition (soil and sediment) and
enantioselective degradation of cis-bifenthrin, cypermethrin and
permethrin occurred at half-life of 270–277 days, 52–135 days,
and 99–141 days, respectively. Absence of enantioselectivity
in biodegradation represents preferential condition for
transformation (Qin et al., 2006).
Axenic culture of Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens ,B. cereus , and
Achromobacter sp. degraded diﬀerent pyrethroids such as
permethrin, fenvalerate, fastac, deltamethrin, and ﬂuvalinate
in the presence of Tween-80 and 3-phenoxybenzoic acidwas the major metabolite. Permethrin rapidly transformed
into 3-phenoxybenzoic acid as compared to other pyrethroids
(less than 5 days). In soils, pyrethroids were degraded into
a diaryl ether metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoate. Eﬃciency of
Pseudomonas strain ET1 in 3-phenoxybenzoate metabolism per
cell was calculated as 2.6 0.910 13gm/cell/hour. Strain
Pseudomonas ET1 morphologically resembles with Pseudomonas
delaﬁeldii but diﬀers in 3-phenoxybenzoate degradation (Toppw
and Akhtar, 1991). One strain cannot degrade all aromatic
compounds due to the structural diﬀerences except genetically
modiﬁed strains, which can be modiﬁed to simultaneously
degrade diﬀerent compounds (Gong et al., 2018).
GENE CLONING AND ENZYMATIC
CHARACTERIZATION OF PYRETHROID
CARBOXYLESTERASES
Esterease (carboxyl ester hydrolase) play an important role in
initial transformation of parent pyrethroid by attacking ester
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 August 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1778fmicb-10-01778 July 31, 2019 Time: 20:7 # 10

bond or cytochrome P-450 dependent monooxygenase on acid
or alcohol moieties (Kamita et al., 2016). Many researchers
have studied carboxylesterase isolation and puriﬁcation from
B. cereus SM3, Klebsiella sp. ZD112, Sphingobium sp. JZ2,
Pseudomonas ﬂourescens SM-3, A. niger ZD11, Ochrobactrum
lupini DG-S-01, Streptomyces aureus HP-S-01, Streptomyces sp.
HU-S-01, Pseudomonas stutzeri ,Micrococcus sp. CPN 1, Serratia
sp. JC1 and Serratia sp. JCN13, Pichia pastoris (Cyco ´n and
Piotrowska-Seget, 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2017).
Limitations in culture dependent approaches are popularizing
the metagenomics tools. Thermostable pyrethroid esterase
Sys410 was investigated by metagenomic approach and enzyme
contained 280 amino acids having a molecular mass of 30.8 KDa
(Fan et al., 2012; Popovic et al., 2017). Cloning was carried
out from metagenomic library of soil samples and sequence
analysis revealed that 819 bp pye3 gene codes for 273 amino
acid protein. Enzyme was further characterized on the basis
of enzyme kinetics ( Kmand Kcatactivity) (Li et al., 2008;
Luo et al., 2018).
Reported pyrethroid hydrolases have diﬀerent pH and
molecular weight. Carboxyl esterase enzymes can catabolize
wide array of similar ester containing compounds. Because of
enantioselectivity, a few essterases exhibit speciﬁc or moderate
kinetic abilities, which diﬀer from pyrethroid degrading
enzymes. Enzyme expression and metabolites production
during pyrethroid degradation is diﬀerential and can be
sequentially up-regulated or down regulated (Bhatt et al., 2019b).
Metagenomic based library was useful for the identiﬁcation
and mining of pyrethroid degrading genes, such as pytY and
pytZ (O. anthropi strain YZ1), estP (Klebsiella sp. JD112), pytH
(Sphingobium sp. JZ-1), and pye(soil). These genes can be used
for isolation and comparison of novel pyrethroid degrading
microbial strains.
Bacterial cells produce CO 2from 3-phenoxybenzoate at Km
(Michaelis constant) value of 1.4 0.8mM that reveals high
aﬃnity of bacterial cells to 3-phenoxybenzoate. Metabolism
of this pyrethroid intermediate is constitutive rather than
catabolite repression. Maloney et al. (1993) were the ﬁrst to
report enzymatic catalysis of pyrethroids in B. cereus strain
SM3. Enzyme initially named as permethrinase (61 3 KDa)
was ﬁnally termed as carboxylesterase after successive studies.
Pure culture and cell free extract of B. cereus SM3 successfully
hydrolyzed 2nd and 3rd generation pyrethroids. Permethrin was
hydrolyzed more rapidly as compared to ﬂumethrin.
Esterase is ranked under subcategory of hydrolases and
International Union of Biochemistry classiﬁed carboxylesterase
as subgroup 3.1.1. Active site of this enzyme contains
serine residue that plays role in acylation during pyrethroid
biodegradation through nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl group
(OH). Transformed pyrethroid metabolites are easily excreted
in urine because of their better water solubility than original
pyrethroids. It justiﬁes high concentrations of carboxylesterase
enzyme in mammalian serum and liver (Sogorb and Vilanova,
2002). There are two major categories of carboxylestearases in
human body (carbocylesterase-1 and carboxylesterase-2), which
can degrade pyrethroids (Wang et al., 2018). Pyrethroid trans
forms are more easily degraded by carboxylesterases as comparedtocis-isomer. Due to high aﬃnity for NaCchannels, trans isomers
are more toxic to mammalian tissues. Rabbit serum contains
higher cypermethrin degradation activity (WHO Task Group on
Environmental Health Criteria for Permethrin et al., 1990).
Novel pyrethroid hydrolyzing esterase was reported from
Klebsiella sp. strain ZD112. Gene estP contains an open reading
frame of 1914 bp, encoding a protein of 637 amino acids and
molecular mass of 73 KDa. Puriﬁed enzyme can eﬀectively
degrade wide variety of ester bond containing pesticides. Km
value for trans and cispermethrin indicated that EstP has higher
catalytic power than carboxylesterase enzyme (Wu et al., 2006).
A novel pytH esterase gene, coding pyrethroid hydrolyzing
carboxylesterase was also reported in Sphingobium sp. strain JZ1
having an open reading frame of 840 bp. Further cloning and
puriﬁcation of this enzyme revealed its molecular weight of about
31 KDa, isoelectric point (pI) of 4.85, and it does not require
any cofactor for degrading diﬀerent pyrethroids (Wang et al.,
2009). Degradation of fenpropathrin and fenvalerate in alkaline
and acidic soil was observed as enantioselective under aerobic
conditions (Li et al., 2009).
Co-expression of two target genes [organophosphate
hydrolase ( opd) and carboxylesterase B1 ( b1)] from
Falovobacterium sp. and Culex pipens is used for degradation
of organophosphorous, carbamate, and pyrethroid pesticides.
Carboxylesterase 001D that was isolated from Helicoverpa
armigera and heterologously expressed in bacteria ( E. coli )
potentially hydrolysed cypermethrin and fenvalerate (Li
et al., 2016). Advanced genetic engineering techniques can
enable a single microorganism to degrade multiple pesticides
(Lan et al., 2006).
Fungal enzymes have also been reported for pesticide
biodegradation. Some fungal enzymes catalyze esteriﬁcation,
hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and deoxygenation during
the degradation process. A. niger YAT carries out etheriﬁcation
reaction during cypermethrin biodegradation. Similar to
metabolites of pyrethroid bacterial biodegradation, degrading
enzymes of fungal strains have been conﬁrmed as well
(Maqbool et al., 2016).
Carboxylesterases of Lucila cuprina and Drosophila
melanogaster with mutagenesis in active site were used to
study pyrethroid degradation. Carboxylesterase was cloned and
expressed by genetic engineering to observe their pyrethroid
degradation eﬃciency (Heidari et al., 2005). Human liver
carboxylesterase hcE1 and hcE2 degraded both type I and type II
pyrethroids with stereoselcetivity. trans -isomers were degraded
more rapidly by these enzymes as compared to cis-isomer
(Table 4 ).Kmvalues of enzyme catalysis were lower as compared
to pyrethroid compounds (Nishi et al., 2006). Human, rat
and rabbit hepatocarboxylesterases also depicted capability to
degrade pyrethroids (Ross et al., 2006). Esterases in Heliothis
virescens larvae were found to be associated with their resistance
to pyrethroids (Huang and Ottea, 2004). Development of next
generation sequencing (NGS) methods has enabled us to use
genetically engineered microorganism for large-scale pyrethroid
hydrolases. Heterologous expression of human and insect
pyrethroid hydrolases can be more beneﬁcial for pyrethroid
removal from contaminated sites.

FIGURE 2 | Detailed metabolic pathways of pyrethoids in microorganisms.
METABOLIC PATHWAYS OF
PYRETHROID BIODEGRADATION
Every living cell that can survive in diﬀerent environmental
conditions must has metabolic pathways, which help to
fetch required food (nutrition) from the surroundings (soil,
water). Oxygenases (monooxygenases and dioxygensases) play
important role in biodegradation of pesticides by common
pathways (Fuchs et al., 2011; Birolli et al., 2016b; Bhatt
et al., 2019b). Pyrethroid degrading cells (bacteria, fungi
and some animal cells) produce metabolites and make them
accessory for downstream pathways ( Figure 2 ). Casida identiﬁed
the pyrethroid breakdown pathway in 1960. Pyrethroids are
metabolized in human body via catabolic pathway. Distribution
of carboxylesterases in diﬀerent tissues has been reported and
major esterase of intestine is called carboxylesterase 2 (hCE2) thathas higher catalytic activity as compared to liver and other tissue
cells (Crow et al., 2007).
Hydroxyester metabolites are produced during oxidative
pathways whereas oxidative ester cleavage is the minor pathway
of some pyrethroids. Isomers of various pyrethroids are
aﬀected diﬀerently by initial hydrolytic attack. Pyrethroid
degradation by hydroxyl group (OH ) nucleophilic attack
under alkaline conditions is similar to simple aliphatic
ester. Chemically, ester or nitrile hydrolysis occurs under
alkaline conditions. Ester (bond) hydrolysis produces acid
(RCOO ) and 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde, via fast decomposition
of intermediary compound cyanohydrins. Another parallel
hydrolysis pathway produces primary amide that again
hydrolyze into RCOO acid and 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde
(Wang et al., 2018). Microbial degradation follows the
same pattern and most of the metabolites are common in

Bhatt et al. Microbial Degradation of Pyrethroids
all microbial pathways with only a few exceptions. Strains
belonging to genera Bacillus ,Micrococcus ,Staphylococcus
aureus ,R. ornithinolytica , and Catellibacterium are used
for pyrethroid detection (Tallur et al., 2008; Chen et al.,
2013b; Zhao et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019). Consortium
biodegradation pathways of B.cereus ZH3 and S. aureus,
and Bacillus licheniformis B1 and Sphingomonas sp. SC-1
have also been reported (Chen et al., 2012b; Liu et al., 2013;
Wang et al., 2019). 3-Phenoxybenzaldehyde and 2,2,3,3
tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid were detected during
cypermethrin degradation by Bacillus sp. SG2 and Bacillus
subtilis BSF01 (Tallur et al., 2008; Bhatt et al., 2016b).
Cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, 2,2-dimethyl-3 (2-methyl-1-
propenyl), 2-ethyl, 1,3 dimethyl cyclopent 2-ene carboxylic
acid, chrysanthemic acid and allethrolone (2-cyclopenten-1-
one-4 hydroxy-3 methyl 2 (2 propenyl) were found as major
metabolites of allethrin during degradation by Acidomonas sp.
Hydrolysis, oxidation and dehydrogenation reactions mediated
allethrin biodegradation (Paingankar et al., 2005; Bhatt et al.,
2016b; Birolli et al., 2016b).
Bacillus sp. DG-02 primarily degraded fenpropathrin
through carboxylester linkage cleavage to yield 2,2,3,3-
tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid phenyl ester and
a-hyroxy-3-phenoxybenzeneacetonitrile which transformed
into 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde spontaneously, followed by the
oxidization of 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde via diaryl cleavage
(Chen et al., 2014). B. thuringiensis ZS-19 transformed
cyhalothrin by cleavage of both the ester linkage and
diaryl bond to yield six intermediate products including
a-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-benzeneacetonitrile, 3-phenoxyphenyl
acetonitrile, N-(2-isoproxy-phenyl)-4-phenoxy-benzamide,
3-phenoxybenzaldehyde, 3-phenoxybenzoate, and phenol,
respectively (Chen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018). Esterase
is essential for ester bond cleavage during pyrethroid
degradation. Initially carboxylesterase activity forms two
metabolites ( RS)-a-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol and
2,2,3,3 tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid. Finally 2,2,3,3
tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid is converted into CO 2
after few steps but (RS)- a-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol
is transformed into stable 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (3-PBA).
This step is catalyzed by 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde alcohol
dehydrogenase that transroms 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde to
3-phenoxybenzoate. Another enzyme phenoxybenzoate 1,2-
dioxygenase transforms 3-phenoxybenzoate into 3,4-dihydroxy-
benzoate (protocatechuate) and phenol. Protocatechuate
and phenols are further converted into primary and secondary
metabolites by microorganisms (Wang et al., 2019). Tricarboxylic
acid and glycolysis pathways are mainly used by microbes to
produce energy from the pyrethroids (Wang et al., 2014;
Gajendiran and Abraham, 2018).
RECENT TOOLS FOR PYRETHROID
BIODEGRADATION
Traditional identiﬁcation of microorganisms was based on
biochemical tests. Inaccurate results of these tests usuallyresulted in wrong isolation and characterization. Development
of molecular biology tools have facilitated the isolation
and identiﬁcation of pyrethroid degrading microbes (16S
rRNA for bacteria and ITS sequencing for fungi) (Gangola
et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2018). Degradation of pyrethroids
is commonly analyzed by chromatographic techniques
such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
gas chromatography (GC), and mass spectroscopy (MS)
(Castellarnau et al., 2016). Due to their low pyrethroid
detection limit in soil samples, combination of solid phase
extraction and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-
MS) was developed as a new method (Chen et al., 2012a;
Braganca et al., 2018). After microbial degradation, these
methods can eﬃciently detect pyrethroid metabolites up to
ng/gm of soil (Braganca et al., 2018). RSM is generally used
for the optimization of pyrethroids and diﬀerent kinetics
of pesticides have been reported (Chen et al., 2012e; Bhatt
et al., 2016a,b; Morales et al., 2019). First order reaction
is followed for pyrethroid degradation and for the impact
analysis on humans whereas cell culture techniques are
employed for pyrethroid toxicity detection. Development
of rapid genomic tools could analyze the whole genome
of pyrethroid catabolizing microorganisms (Bhatt, 2018;
Bhatt and Barh, 2018).
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER ASPECTS
To feed the world’s rapidly growing population, large-scale
use of pesticides in agricultural systems cannot be stopped.
Pyrethroid insecticides are used in most of the countries and
exhibit comparatively less toxicity than organophosphate and
organochlorine pesticides. Recently, toxicity of pyrethroids on
marine life (ﬁsh), humans and phytotoxicity has been reported.
Esterase can degrade ester bond of pyrethroids to produce
metabolite 3-penoxybenzaldehyde. Pyrethroid degrading esterase
and 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde can be used as signature molecule
for pyrethroid biodegradation. Based on this potential marker,
pyrethroids degrading microorganism can be selected in a shorter
period. Molecular chronometer based coverage of esterase
enzyme is possible with existing data. Consortium based pesticide
biodegradation approach is more suitable but it has not been
signiﬁcantly studied for pyrethroid degradation. Previous data
favors the development of pyrethroid degradation mechanism
through microbial system. In future, omics technologies
could potentially be used for pyrethroid degradation and to
understand molecular biology, enzyme kinetics, and metabolic
pathways. System biology of pyrethroid degradation can be
further useful for the investigation of multiple information
at one platform.
