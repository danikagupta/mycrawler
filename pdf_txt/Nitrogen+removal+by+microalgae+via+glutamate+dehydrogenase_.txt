EDITION
K13023“ ... stands out for its in-depth information on structural and mechanical anatomy, 
with flagella as the most prominent example. The meticulous and elegant 
drawings of algal apparatuses and their mechanics make it easy to understand 
complex structures and functions, as well as constitutes another outstanding feature of this book.”
—Senjie Lin, Marine Sciences, University of Connecticut, Groton, The Quarterly 
Review of Biology, Vol. 81, December 2006
“ ... the authors concentrate on highlighting interesting and illuminating topics, 
with the idea of inciting the sort of wonder and curiosity that will encourage 
further outstanding research.”—Willem F . Prud’homme van Reine, Blumea, 2006, Vol. 51, No.3
A single-source reference on the biology of algae, Algae: Anatomy, Biochem-
istry, and Biotechnology, Second Edition  examines the most important taxa 
and structures for freshwater, marine, and terrestrial forms of algae. Its com -
prehensive coverage goes from algae’s historical role through its taxonomy and ecology to its natural product possibilities.
The authors have gathered a significant amount of new material since the 
publication of the first edition. This completely revised second edition contains 
many changes and additions including the following:
• All revised and rewritten tables, plus new figures, many in color
• A fascinating new chapter: Oddities and Curiosities in the Algal World
• Expanded information on algal anatomy
• Absorption spectra from all algal divisions, chlorophylls, and accessory 
pigments
• Additional information on collection, storage, and preservation of algae
• Updated section on algal toxins and algal bioactive molecules
The book’s unifying theme is on the important role of algae in the earth’s 
self-regulating life support system and its function within restorative models of planetary health. It also discusses algae’s biotechnological applications, 
including potential nutritional and pharmaceutical products. Written for students 
as well as researchers, teachers, and professionals in the field of phycology and applied phycology, this new full-color edition is both illuminating and inspiring. Biological Sciences

Preface
In the seven years since the first edition of this book was published, we have built up a large amount 
of new material and data in the field of algology, based on our own experiences in reading, writing, 
and reviewing. With the aid of all this information, we have completely revised the book, introduc -
ing the following changes and additions:
• We have added 27 new figures for a total of 205 figures, many of them in color
• All the 38 tables have been revised and rewritten
• We have updated the literature in all chapters
• We wrote an entirely new chapter on how odd algae can be
• We have rewritten Chapter 1, updating the classification of algae and modifying the section 
on the endosymbiosis and origin of eukaryotic photosynthesis
• We have expanded Chapter 2, adding new types of root systems and algal swimming pat -
terns and modifying the section on photoreception and photoreceptors
• We have updated Chapter 3, adding absorption spectra measured on samples from all algal 
divisions together with their decomposition in pigments. We have also added the absorp -
tion spectra of all the chlorophylls and the accessory pigments
• We have modified notation and wording of Chapters 4 and 5
• We have expanded section on collection storage and preservation in Chapter 6, adding new 
information on automatic algae recognition and classification
• We have rewritten Chapter 7, updating the section on algal toxins and algal bioactive 
molecules
• We have, of course, corrected the numerous errors present in the first edition (we do apolo -
gize for them), doing our best to avoid errors in this new edition
Like the previous edition, this book is written and designed for undergraduate and postgraduate 
students with a general scientific background, having their first academic experience with the world 
of algae, as well as researchers, teachers, and professionals in the field of phycology and applied 
phycology. Our major commitment is still the same, challenging and stimulating both students and 
teachers to move beyond the limit of the written page to further explore not only the topics high -
lighted in the book, but also all the new ideas that can spring to mind (we hope!) after reading each 
chapter.
Though updated, the bibliography is still by no means exhaustive; we have not attempted to be 
comprehensive and many excellent papers will be missing. Our intention was to put in only enough 
to lead the readers into the right part of the primary literature in a fairly directed manner and to 
provide a sort of orienteering compass in the “mare magnum” of scientific literature.
We are deeply grateful to the staff at CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, particularly our patient and 
comprehensive editor John Sulzycki for trusting us enough to ask for a second edition and to the 
senior project coordinator Jill Jurgensen, who had to cope with all our e-mail.
Again, our sincere gratitude and a special thanks to Valter Evangelista for his skillful assistance 
and ability in preparing the final form of all the drawings and illustrations, and for his careful atten -
tion in preparing all the technical drawings of this second edition. We appreciate his efforts to keep 
pace with us both and to cope with our ever-changing demands and corrections and second thoughts 
without getting too upset. We know we have driven him crazy.
And we will always be grateful to Vincenzo Passarelli, who took care of the lab, making our 
work lighter and smoother. Next February he will retire, leaving our group after more than 30 years; xiv Preface
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCwe have grown old together and we already know we will miss his smile, and his special trumpet-
like whistling.
For the new illustrations present in the book, we are indebted to Luca Barsanti, brother of Laura 
and Maria Antonietta, who succeeded in realizing most of the drawing of our book before dying in 
February 2005. He made the drawing work in a wonderful way, confirming his artistic skill. Though 
almost eight years have passed by, and some snow has also fallen on his roof, he is still the same 
light-hearted and amusing company who delighted us during the preparation of the first edition. We 
will be always grateful to him.xv

General Overview
DEFINITION
The term algae  has no formal taxonomic standing; however, it is routinely used to indicate a poly -
phyletic (i.e., including organisms that do not share a common origin, but follow multiple and inde -
pendent evolutionary lines), non-cohesive, and artificial assemblage of O2-evolving, photosynthetic 
organisms (with several exceptions of colorless members undoubtedly related to pigmented forms). 
According to this definition, plants could be considered an algal division. Algae and plants produce 
the same storage compounds as well as use similar defense strategies against predators and para -
sites. A strong morphological similarity exists between some algae and plants; however, distinguish -
ing algae from plants is quite easy since the similarities we have listed between algae and plants 
are much fewer than their differences. Plants show a very high degree of differentiation, with roots, 
leaves, stems, and xylem/phloem vascular network, their reproductive organs are surrounded by a 
jacket of sterile cells, they have a multicellular diploid embryo stage that remains developmentally 
and nutritionally dependent on the parental gametophyte for a significant period (and this feature is 
the source of the name embryophytes given to plants), and tissue-generating parenchymatous meri -
stems at the shoot and root apices producing tissues that differentiate in a wide variety of shapes. 
Moreover, all plants have a digenetic life cycle, with an alternation between a haploid gametophyte 
and a diploid sporophyte. Algae do not have any of these features, they do not have roots, stems, 
leaves, nor well-defined vascular tissues, even though many seaweeds are plant-like in appearance 
and some of them show specialization and differentiation of their vegetative cells, they do not form 
embryos, their reproductive structures consist of cells that are all potentially fertile and lack sterile 
cells covering or protecting them, parenchymatous development is present only in some groups, and 
have both monogenetic and digenetic life cycles. Moreover, algae occur in dissimilar forms such 
as microscopic single cells, macroscopic multicellular loose or filmy conglomerations, matted or 
branched colonies, or more complex leafy or blade forms, which contrast strongly with uniformity 
in vascular plants. Evolution may have worked in two ways: one for shaping similarities and one for 
shaping differences. The same environmental pressure led to the parallel, independent evolution of 
similar traits in both plants and algae, while the transition from relatively stable aquatic environ -
ment to a gaseous medium exposed plants to new physical conditions that resulted in key physiologi -
cal and structural changes necessary to be able to invade upland habitats and fully exploit them. 
The bottom line is that plants are a separate group with no overlapping with the algal assemblage.
The profound diversity of size ranging from picoplankton only 0.2–2.0 μm in diameter to giant 
kelps with fronds up to 60 m in length, ecology and colonized habitats, cellular structure, levels 
of organization and morphology, pigments for photosynthesis, reserve and structural polysaccha -
rides, type of life history reflect the varied evolutionary origins of this heterogeneous assemblage of 
organisms, including both prokaryote and eukaryote species. The term algae  refers to macroalgae 
and a highly diversified group of microorganisms known as microalgae. Estimates of the number 
of living algae varies from 30,000 to more than 1 million species, but most of the reliable estimates 
refer to the numbers given in AlgaeBase, which currently documents 32,260 species of organisms 
generally regarded as algae of an estimated 43,918 described species of algae, corresponding to 
about 73%. According to the AlgaeBase estimate of 28,500 species waiting for description, the total 
number of algal species is likely to be about 72,500, of which more than 20,000 will be diatomic.12 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCCLASSIFICATION
Over the past 30 years, molecular phylogenetic studies have led to extensive modification of tradi -
tional classification schemes for algae; nowadays no easily definable classification system accept -
able to all exists for this group of organisms, since taxonomy is under constant and rapid revision 
at all levels following everyday new genetic and ultrastructural evidence. Keeping in mind that the 
polyphyletic nature of the algal group is somewhat inconsistent with traditional taxonomic group -
ings, though they are still useful to define the general characteristics and levels of organizations, 
and aware of the fact that taxonomic opinion may change as information accumulates, we will adopt 
a tentative scheme of classification mainly based on the most recently published classifications. In 
particular, we will integrate the most recent publications on revised classifications of eukaryotes 
and specific groups to obtain a classification scheme highlighting the presence of algae in the four 
kingdoms of Bacteria, Plantae, Chromista, and Protozoa. The main purpose of the classification 
here reported is to categorize the diversity of the algae in a very practical manner, providing names 
useful for teaching students and searching the literature.
Prokaryotic members of this assemblage are grouped into the kingdom Bacteria, phy -
lum Cyanobacteria, with the single class of Cyanophyceae. Members of the proposed division 
Prochlorophyta, considered artificial, are currently included in this class. 
Eukaryotic members are grouped into the three kingdoms of Plantae, with four phyla, Chromista, 
with four phyla, and Protozoa, with two phyla. Table 1.1 shows the different classes comprised in the 
11 phyla. Figure 1.1 shows examples of representatives of each class.
OCCURRENCE AND DISTRIBUTION
Algae can be aquatic or subaerial, when they are exposed to the atmosphere rather than being sub -
merged in water. Aquatic algae are found almost everywhere from freshwater spring to salt lakes, 
with tolerance for a broad range of pH, temperature, turbidity, O2, and CO2 concentration. They can 
be planktonic, as most unicellular species do, living suspended throughout the lighted regions of all 
water bodies including under ice in polar areas. They can also be benthonic, attached to the bottom 
or living within sediments, limited to shallow areas because of the rapid attenuation of light with 
depth. Benthic algae can grow attached on stones (epilithic), on mud or sand (epipelic), on other 
algae or plants (epiphytic), or on animals (epizoic). In the case of marine algae, other terms can also 
be used to describe their growth habits, such as supralittoral, when they grow above the high-tide 
level, within the reach of waves and spray; intertidal, when they grow on shores exposed to tidal 
cycles; or sublittoral, when they grow in the benthic environment from the extreme low-water level 
to around 200-m deep, in the case of very clear water.
Oceans covering about 71% of the earth’s surface contain more than 5000 species of planktonic 
microscopic algae, the phytoplankton, which forms the base of the marine food chain and produces 
roughly 50% of the oxygen we inhale. However, phytoplankton is not only a cause of life, but also 
sometimes a cause of death. When the population becomes too large in response to pollution with 
nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate, these blooms can reduce the water transparency, causing the 
death of other photosynthetic organisms. They are often responsible for massive fish and bird kills, 
producing poisons and toxins. The temperate pelagic marine environment is also the realm of giant 
algae, the kelp. These algae have thalli up to 60-m long, and the community can be so crowded that 
it forms a real submerged forest; they are not limited to temperate waters, as they also form luxuriant 
thickets beneath polar ice sheets, and can survive at very low depth (more than 200 m), where the 
faint light is bluish-green and its intensity is only 0.0005% that of surface light. At these depths, the 
red part of the sunlight spectrum is filtered out from the water and not enough energy is available for

dark purple. In contrast, algae that live in high-irradiance habitats typically have pigments that pro -
tect them against the photo-damages caused by the presence of singlet oxygen. It is the composition 
and amount of accessory and protective pigments that give algae their wide variety of colors and, 
for several algal groups, their common names such as brown algae, red algae, golden, and green 
algae. Internal freshwater environment displays a wide diversity of form of microalgae, although not 
exhibiting the phenomenal size range of their marine relatives. Freshwater phytoplankton and the 
benthonic algae form the base of the aquatic food chain.
A considerable number of subaerial algae have adapted to life on land. They can occur in surpris -
ing places such as tree trunks, animal fur, snow banks, hot springs, or even embedded within desert 
rocks. The activities of land algae are thought to convert rock into soil, to minimize soil erosion as 
well as to increase water retention and nutrient availability for plants growing nearby.
Algae also form mutually beneficial partnership with other organisms. They live with fungi to 
form lichens, or inside the cells of reef-building corals, in both cases providing oxygen and complex 
nutrients to their partner, and in return receiving protection and simple nutrients. This arrangement 
enables both partners to survive in conditions that they could not endure alone.
Chapter 8 will describe in detail some of the many and unusual interaction algae establish with 
different and distant environmental settings and other organisms, to highlight the extreme physi -
ological variability and plasticity of this heterogeneous assemblage.
Table 1.2 summarizes the different types of habitat colonized by the algae of the divisions.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCUnicells  and Unicell  colonial  Type
Many algae are solitary cells, the unicell, with or without flagella, hence motile or nonmotile. 
Nannochloropsis  (Ochrophyta) (Figures 1.1am and 1.2) is an example of a nonmotile unicell, while 
Ochromonas  (Ochrophyta) (Figures 1.1ai and 1.3) is an example of a motile unicell. Other algae 
exist as aggregates of few or many single cells held together loosely or in a highly organized fash -
ion, the colony. In this type of aggregate, cell number is indefinite, growth occurs by cell division 
of its components, there is no division of labor, and each cell can survive on its own. Hydrurus  
(Ochrophyta) (Figure 1.4) forms long and bushy nonmotile colonies with cells evenly distributed 
throughout a gelatinous matrix, while Synura  (Ochrophyta) (Figures 1.1bd and 1.5) forms free-
swimming colonies composed of cells held together by their elongated posterior ends. Another 
quite unusual example of colony is Tetraflagellochloris mauritanica  (Chlorophyta) (Figure 1.6a and 
1.6b): up to 12 cells can be arranged in groups, which are connected by intercellular diaphragms 
and cytoplasmic bridges, without sharing any common colonial boundary. When the number and 
arrangement of cells are determined at the time of origin of the colony and remain constant during

(Figure 1.7) with its spherical colonies composed of up to 50,000 flagellated cells interconnected 
by cytoplasmic bridges is an example of a motile coenobium, as well as Eudorina  (Chlorophyta) 
(Figure 1.8). Hydrodictyon  (Chlorophyta) with its flat plat-like networks of several thousand cells 
and Pediastrum  (Chlorophyta) (Figure 1.9) with its flat colonies of cells characterized by spiny 
 protuberances are examples of nonmotile coenobia.
Filamen ToUs Type
Filaments result from cell division in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the filament and 
have cell chains consisting of daughter cells connected to each other by their end wall. Filaments 
can be simple as in Oscillatoria  (Cyanobacteria) (Figure 1.10), Spirogyra  (Chlorophyta) 
(Figure 1.11), or Ulothrix  (Chlorophyta) (Figure 1.12), have false branching as in Tolypothrix  
(Cyanobacteria) (Figure 1.13) or Scytonema  (Cyanobacteria) (Figure 1.14), or true branching as 
in Cladophora  (Chlorophyta) (Figure 1.15). Filaments of Stigonema ocellatum  (Cyanobacteria)

mamillosum  (Cyanobacteria) (Figure 1.17) made up of multiple layers are called multiseriate.
siphonoclado Us Type
The algae with this cytomorphological design have multicellular thalli, with a basically uniseriate 
filamentous, branched, or unbranched organization, composed of multinucleate cells as a conse -
quence of uncoupled cell division and mitosis. The synchronously dividing nuclei are organized 
in nonmotile, regularly spaced nucleocytoplasmic domains that are maintained by perinuclear 
microtubule arrays. Despite lacking clear physical borders, such as a plasma membrane, these 
cytoplasmic domains behave like independent structural entities or pseudocells. This morpho -
type is present in members of the class Ulvophyceae (Chlorophyta) such as Cladophora  sp. and 
Anadyomene  sp.
siphono Us Type
Siphonous algae consist of a single giant tubular cell containing thousands to millions of nuclei 
dividing by asynchronous mitosis, and hence they are unicellular, but multinucleate (or coenocytic). 
No cross-walls are present and the algae often take the form of branching tubes. The sparsely 
branched tube of Vaucheria  (Ochrophyta) (Figure 1.18) is an example of coenocyte or apocyte, 
a single cell containing many nuclei. Bryopsis  (Chlorophyta) and Acetabularia  sp. (Chlorophyta) 
(Figures 1.1t and 1.19) are other quite diverse examples; the first is a fern-like, asymmetrically 
branched, marine alga composed of a single, tubular-shaped cell which contains multiple nuclei 
and chloroplasts in a thin cytoplasmic layer surrounding a large central vacuole. The second is an 
umbrella-shaped alga, with a rhizoid, a stalk, and a cap-like whorl, growing in clusters attached on 
rocks. The single-compartment architecture of siphonous algae would suggest that they are particu -
larly vulnerable to injury; but even if damage does occur, a complex, multistep wound response is 
triggered and a wound can be plugged in seconds, regenerating the lost tissue. Many species can 
even use a small bit of excised tissue to regenerate the rest of the plant. This ability offers these algae

been accidentally introduced, notably the Mediterranean Sea, certain species of siphonous green 
algae (e.g., Caulerpa racemosa ; Figure 1.20) have proved all successful, displacing native marine 
flora over large areas.
parenchyma ToUs and pseUdo-parenchyma ToUs Type
These algae are mostly macroscopic with tissue of undifferentiated cells and growth originating 
from a meristem with cell division in three dimensions. In the case of parenchymatous algae, cells 
of the primary filament divide in all directions and any essential filamentous structure is lost. This 
tissue organization is present in Ulva  (Chlorophyta) (Figure 1.1r), where the thallus is simply orga -
nized in a two-cell layered sheet and in many of the brown algae as Laminaria  or Fucus . Pseudo-
parenchymatous algae are made up of a loose or close aggregation of numerous, intertwined, 
branched filaments that collectively form the thallus, held together by mucilage, especially in red 
algae. Thallus construction is entirely based on a filamentous construction with little or no internal

parenchymatous structure.
palmelloid  Type
This type of thallus organization consists of nonmotile, quite independent cells embedded within 
a common mucilaginous matrix. The name comes from the similarity with the algae belonging to 
the genus Palmella  (Chlorophyta) which form gelatinous colonies, with nonflagellate, spherical, or 
ellipsoid cells uniformly arranged at the peripheral matrix. The palmelloid type can be present as a 
temporary phase of the life cycle in some species and as permanent feature in others. Under unfa -
vorable conditions, algae such as Chlamydomonas  (Chlorophyta), Haematococcus  (Chlorophyta), 
or Euglena  (Euglenozoa) (Figure 1.22) lose their flagella, round off, and undergo successive divi -
sions, while the cells secrete mucus. Once favorable conditions are restored, the mucilage dissolves 
and cells revert to the flagellate conditions.
In members of the genus Tetraspora  (Chlorophyta), this organization is a permanent feature: 
colonies are vesicular and sac-like, containing many hundreds of cells at the periphery, with long 
pseudocilia extending beyond the mucilaginous matrix. The palmelloid organization is present

to dimly lit habitats and deep water. These algae possess a unique type of multicellularity: they 
form well-defined macroscopic bodies composed of small spherical cells embedded in a firm 
gelatinous matrix.
NUTRITION
Following our definition of the term algae , most algal groups should be considered photoau -
totrophs, that is, depending entirely on their photosynthetic apparatus for their metabolic 
necessities, using sunlight as the source of energy, and CO2 as the carbon source to produce 
carbohydrates and adenosine triphosphate. Most algal divisions contain colorless heterotrophic 
species that can obtain organic carbon from the external environment, either by taking up dis -
solved substances (osmotrophy) or by engulfing bacteria and other cells such as particulate prey 
(phagotrophy). There also exist some algae that cannot synthesize essential components such as 
the vitamins of the B12 complex, or fatty acids, and have to import them; these algae are defined 
auxotrophic.
However, it is widely accepted that algae use a complex spectrum of nutritional strategies, com -
bining photoautotrophy and heterotrophy. This ability is referred to as mixotrophy. The relative 
contribution of autotrophy and heterotrophy to growth within mixotrophic species varies along a 
gradient from algae whose dominant mode of nutrition is phototrophy, through those for which pho -
totrophy or heterotrophy provide essential nutritional supplements, to those for which heterotrophy 
is the dominant strategy. Some mixotrophs are mainly photosynthetic and only occasionally use an 
organic energy source. Others meet most of their nutritional demand by phagotrophy, but may use 
some of the products of photosynthesis from sequestered prey chloroplasts. Photosynthetic fixation 
of carbon as well as use of particulate food as a source of major nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, 
and iron) and growth factors (e.g., vitamins, essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids) can 
enhance growth, especially in extreme environments where resources are limited. Heterotrophy 
can be important for the acquisition of carbon when light is limiting and, conversely, autotrophy can 
maintain a cell during periods when particulate food is scarce.
On the basis of their nutritional strategies, we can classify algae into four groups:
 1. Obligate heterotrophic algae : they are primarily heterotrophic, but are capable of sustain -
ing themselves by phototropy when prey concentrations limit heterotrophic growth (e.g., 
Gymnodium gracilentum , Myzozoa);
FIGURE 1.22  Palmelloid phase of Euglena gracilis . Scale bar: 5 μm.17 General Overview
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2. Obligate phototrophic algae : their primary mode of nutrition is phototrophy, but they 
can supplement growth by phagotrophy and/or osmotrophy when light is limiting (e.g., 
Dinobryon divergens , Ochrophyta);
 3.  Facultative mixotrophic algae : they can grow equally well as photoautotrophs and as het -
erotrophs (e.g., Fragilidium subglobosum , Myzozoa);
 4.  Obligate mixotrophic algae : their primary mode of nutrition is phototrophy, but phagot -
rophy and/or osmotrophy provide substances essential for growth (in this group, we can 
include photoautoxotrophic algae) (e.g., Euglena gracilis , Euglenozoa).
REPRODUCTION
Methods of reproduction in algae may be vegetative by division of a single cell or fragmentation of a 
colony, asexual by production of motile spore, or sexual by union of gametes. Vegetative and asexual 
mode allows stability of an adapted genotype within a species from a generation to the next. Both 
modes provide a fast and economical means of increasing the number of individuals while restricting 
genetic variability. Sexual mode involves plasmogamy (union of cells), karyogamy (union of nuclei), 
chromosome/gene association, and meiosis, resulting in genetic recombination. Sexual reproduction 
allows for variation but is more costly, because of the waste of gametes that fail to mate.
VegeTaTiVe and asexUal reprod UcTion
Binary Fission or Cellular Bisection
It is the simplest form of reproduction; the parent organism divides into two equal parts, each having 
the same hereditary information as the parents. In unicellular algae, cell division may be longitu -
dinal as in Euglena  (Euglenozoa) (Figure 1.23) or transverse. The growth of the population follows 
a typical curve consisting of a lag phase, an exponential or log phase, and a stationary or plateau 
phase, where increase in density has leveled off (see Figure 6.3). In multicellular algae or in algal 
colonies, this process eventually leads to growth of the individual.
FIGURE 1.23  Cell division in Euglena  sp. Scale bar: 5 μm.18 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCZoospore, Aplanospore, and Autospore
Zoospores are flagellate motile spores that may be produced within a parental vegetative cell as in 
Tetraselmis  (Chlorophyta) (Figure 1.24) . Aplanospores are aflagellate spores that begin their devel -
opment within the parent cell wall before being released; these cells can develop into zoospores. 
Autospores are aflagellate daughter cells that will be released from the ruptured wall of the original 
parent cell. They are almost perfect replicas of the vegetative cells that produce them and lack the 
capacity to develop in zoospospores. Examples of autospore-forming genera are Nannochloropsis  
(Ochrophyta) and Chlorella  (Chlorophyta). Spores may be produced within and by ordinary vegeta -
tive cells or within specialized cells or structures called sporangia.
Autocolony Formation
In this reproductive mode, when the coenobium/colony enters the reproductive phase, each cell 
within the colony can produce a new colony similar to the one to which it belongs. Cell division no 
longer produces unicellular individuals but multicellular groups, a sort of embryonic colony that 
differs from the parent in cell size but not in cell number. This mode characterizes green algae such 
as Volvox  (Chlorophyta; Figure 1.7) and Pediastrum  (Chlorophyta; Figure 1.25). In Volvox , division 
is restricted to a series of cells which produce a hollow sphere within the parent colony, and with 
each mitosis each cell becomes smaller. The new colony everts, its cell forms flagella at their api -
cal poles, and it is released by rupture of the parent sphere. In Pediastrum , the protoplast of some 
cells of the colony undergoes divisions to form biflagellate zoospores. These are not liberated but 
aggregate to form a new colony within the parent cell wall.
Fragmentation
A more or less random process whereby noncoenobic colonies or filaments break into two to several 
fragments having the capacity of developing into new individuals.
Resting Stages
Under unfavorable conditions, particularly of desiccation, many algal groups produce thick-walled 
resting cells, such as hypnospores, hypnozygotes, statospores, and akinetes.
Hypnospores and hypnozygotes, which have thickened walls, are produced ex novo by proto -
plasts which previously separated from the walls of the parental cells. Hypnospores are present 
in Ulotrix  spp. (Chlorophyta) and Chlorococcum  spp. (Chlorophyta), whereas hypnozygotes are 
FIGURE 1.24  Zoospores of Tetraselmis  sp. within the parental cell wall. Scale bar: 5 μm.19 General Overview
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCpresent in Spyrogyra  spp. (Chlorophyta) and Dinophyceae (Myzozoa) (Figure 1.26). Hypnospores 
and hypnozygotes enable these green algae to survive temporary drying out of small water bodies 
and also allow aerial transport from one water body to another, for instance, via birds. It is likely 
that dinoflagellate cysts have a similar function.
Statospores are endogenous cysts formed within the vegetative cell by member of Chrysophyceae 
such as Ochromonas  spp. The cyst walls consist predominantly of silica and so are often preserved 
as fossils. These statospores are spherical or ellipsoidal, often ornamented with spines or other pro -
jections. The wall is pierced by a pore, sealed by an unsilicified bung, and a nucleus, chloroplasts 
and abundant reserve material lie within the cyst. After a period of dormancy, the cyst germinates 
and liberates its content in the form of one to several flagellated cells.
Akinetes is of widespread occurrence in the blue-green and green algae. They are essentially 
enlarged vegetative cells that develop a thickened wall in response to limiting environmental 
nutrients or limiting light. Figure 1.27 shows the akinetes of Anabaena cylindrica  (Cyanophyta). 
They are extremely resistant to drying and freezing, as well as function as a long-term anaerobic 
FIGURE 1.25  Nonmotile coenobium of Pediastrum  sp. Scale bar: 100 μm.

enduring very harsh conditions, and remain viable to assure the continuance of the species. 
When suitable conditions for vegetative growth are restored, the akinete germinates into new 
vegetative cells.
sexUal reprod UcTion
Gametes may be morphologically identical with vegetative cells or markedly differ from them, 
depending on the algal group. The main difference is obviously the DNA content which is haploid 
instead of diploid. Different combinations of gamete types are possible. In the case of isogamy, 
gametes are both motile and indistinguishable. When the two gametes differ in size, we have het -
erogamy. This combination occurs in two types: anysogamy, where both gametes are motile, but 
one is small (sperm) and one is large (egg); oogamy, when only one gamete is motile (sperm), which 
fuses with one nonmotile and very large (egg).
Algae exhibit three different life cycles with variation inside the different groups. The main dif -
ference is the point where meiosis occurs and the type of cells it produces, and whether or not there 
is more than one free-living stage present in the life cycle.
Haplontic or Zygotic Life Cycle
This cycle is characterized by a single predominant haploid vegetative phase, with the meiosis tak -
ing place upon germination of the zygote. Chlamydomonas  (Chlorophyta) (Figure 1.28) exhibits 
this type of life cycle.
Diplontic or Gametic Life Cycle
This cycle has a single predominant vegetative diploid phase, and the meiosis gives rise to haploid 
gametes. Diatoms (Figure 1.29) and Fucus  (Ochrophyta) (Figure 1.30) have a diplontic cycle.
Diplohaplontic or Sporic Life Cycles
These cycles present an alternation of generation between two different phases consisting of a hap -
loid gametophyte and a diploid sporophyte. The gametophyte produces gametes by mitosis, and the 
sporophyte produces spores through meiosis. Alternation of generation in the algae can be isomor -
phic, in which the two phases are morphologically identical as in Ulva  (Chlorophyta) (Figure 1.31) 
or heteromorphic, with predominance of the sporophyte as in Laminaria  (Ochrophyta) (Figure 
1.32), or with predominance of the gametophyte as in Porphyra  (Rhodophyta) (Figure 1.33).

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCSUMMARIES OF THE 11 ALGAL PHYLA
Historically, the major groups of algae were classified on the basis of pigmentation, chemical 
nature of photosynthetic storage product, photosynthetic membrane (thylakoids) organization and 
other features of the chloroplasts, chemistry and structure of the cell wall, number, arrangement, 
and ultrastructure of flagella (if any), occurrence of any other special features, and sexual cycles. 
Recently revised classifications incorporate advances resulting from the widespread use of phy -
logenomic-scale phylogenetic analyses and massively increased taxon sampling in rRNA phylog -
enies. All these studies tend to assess the internal genetic coherence of the major phyla such as 
Cyanobacteria, Glaucophyta, Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, Charophyta, Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, 
Ochrophyta, Cercozoa, Myzozoa, and Euglenozoa, confirming that these divisions are nonartificial. 
Table 1.4 attempts to summarize the main characteristics of the different algal groups.
cyanobac Teria
All blue-green algae (Figures 1.1a and 1.34) and prochlorophytes (Figure 1.35) are nonmotile 
Gram-negative eubacteria. In structural diversity, blue-green algae range from unicells to branched 
and unbranched filaments to unspecialized colonial aggregations and are possibly the most widely 
distributed of any group of algae. They are planktonic, occasionally forming blooms in eutrophic 
lakes and an important component of the picoplankton in both marine and freshwater systems; ben -
thic, as dense mats on soil or in mud flats and hot springs, as the “black zone” high on the seashore, 
and as relatively inconspicuous components in most soils; and symbiotic in diatoms, ferns, lichens, 
cycads, sponges, and other systems. Numerically, these organisms dominate the ocean ecosystems.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThere are approximately 1024 cyanobacterial cells in the oceans. To put that in perspective, the 
number of cyanobacterial cells in the oceans is two orders of magnitude more than all the stars in 
the sky. Pigmentation of cyanobacteria includes both chlorophyll a, blue and red phycobilins (phy -
coerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin), and carotenoids. These accessory pigments lie in the 
phycobilisomes, located in rows on the outer surface of the thylakoids. Their thylakoids, which lie 
free in the cytoplasm, are not arranged in stacks, but singled and equidistant, in contrast to prochlo -
rophytes and most other algae, but similar to Rhodopyta and Glaucophyta.
The reserve polysaccharide is cyanophycean starch, stored in tiny granules lying between the 
thylakoids. In addition, these cells often contain cyanophycin granules, that is, polymer of arginine 
and aspartic acid. Some marine species also contain gas vesicles used for buoyancy regulation. In 
some filamentous cyanobacteria, heterocysts and akinetes are formed. Heterocysts are vegetative 
cells that have been drastically altered (loss of photosystem II, development of a thick, glycolipid 
cell wall), to provide the necessary anoxygenic environment for the process of nitrogen fixation 
(Figure 1.36). Some cyanobacteria produce potent hepato- and neurotoxins.
Prochlorophytes can be unicellular or filamentous, and depending on the filamentous species, 
they can be either branched or unbranched. They exist as free-living components of pelagic nano -
plankton and obligate symbionts within marine didemnid ascidians and holothurians and are mainly 
limited to living in tropical and subtropical marine environments, with optimal growth tempera -
ture at about 24°C. Prochlorophytes possess chlorophyll a and b, as euglenoids and land plants, but 
lack phycobilins, and this is the most significant difference between them and cyanobacteria, which

light spectrum. Other pigments are β-carotene and several xantophylls (zeaxanthin is the principal 
one). Their thylakoids, which lie free in the cytoplasm, are arranged in stacks. Prochlorophytes have 
a starch-like reserve polysaccharide. These prokaryotes contribute a large percentage of the total 
organic carbon in the global tropical oceans, making up from 25% to 60% of the total chlorophyll 
a biomass in the tropical and subtropical oceans. They are also able to fix nitrogen, though not in 
heterocysts. Both blue-green algae and prochlorophytes contain polyhedral bodies (carboxysomes) 
containing RuBisCo (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, the enzyme that converts 
inorganic carbon into reduced organic carbon in all oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms) and 
have similar cell walls characterized by a peptidoglycan layer. Blue-green algae and prochlorophytes 
can be classified as obligate photoautotrophic organisms. Reproduction in both divisions is strictly 
asexual, by simple cell division, fragmentation of the colony, or filaments.
glaUcophy Ta
Glaucophyceae (Figures 1.1b and 1.37) are basically unicellular flagellates with a dorsiventral con -
struction; they bear two unequal flagella, which are inserted into a shallow depression just below 
the apex of the cell. Glaucophyceae are rare freshwater inhabitants, sometimes collected from

cyanin, phycocyanin, and allophycocyanin are organized in phycobilisomes. Carotenoids such as 
β-carotenes and xantophyll zeaxanthins are also present in their chloroplast. This unusual chloro -
plast lies in a special vacuole and presents a thin peptidoglycan wall located between the two plastid 
outer membranes. Thylakoids are not stacked. The chloroplast DNA is concentrated at the center 
of the chloroplast, where typical carboxysomes are present, which contain the RuBisCo enzyme. 
Starch is the reserve polysaccharide, which is accumulated in granular form inside the cytoplasm, 
but outside the chloroplast. Glaucophyceae live photoautotrophically with the aid of blue-green 
plastids often referred to as cyanelles. Cyanelles are presumed to be phylogenetically derived from 
endosymbiotic cyanobacterium. Sexual reproduction is unknown in this division.
rhodophy Ta
This phylum is currently divided into two subphyla, Cyanidiophytina, with the single class of 
Cyanidiophyceae, and Rhodophytina with the remaining six classes. Red algae consist mostly 
of seaweed, but including genera of free-living unicellular microalgae. They inhabit prevalently 
marine ecosystems, but are also present in freshwater and terrestrial environment. The lack of any 
flagellate stages, the lack of centrioles, and the presence of accessory phycobiliproteins (allophyco -
cyanin, phycocyanin, and phycoerythrin) organized in phycobilisomes (shared with Cyanobacteria, 
Cryptophyta, and Glaucophyta) are unique features of these algae; chlorophyll a is the only chlo -
rophyll. Chloroplasts are enclosed by a double-unit membrane; thylakoids do not stack at all, but 
lie equidistant and singly within the chloroplast. One thylakoid is present around the periphery of 
the chloroplast, running parallel to the chloroplast’s internal membrane. The chloroplastic DNA is

uct is the floridean starch, an α-1,4-glucan polysaccharide, which is deposited in the cytoplasm. 
Grains of this starch are located only in the cytoplasm, unlike the starch grains produced in the 
Chlorophyta, which lie inside the chloroplasts. Most rhodophytes live photoautotrophically. In 
the great majority of red algae, cytokinesis is incomplete. Daughter cells are separated by the pit 
connection, a proteinaceous plug that fills the junction between cells; this connection successively 
becomes a plug. Species in which sexual reproduction is known generally have an isomorphic or 
heteromorphic diplohaplontic life cycle; haplontic life cycle is considered an exception.
The class Bangiophyceae includes all multicellular genera, in which the gametophyte has 
chloroplasts lacking a peripheral encircling thylakoid, and the Golgi is associated with both 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrion. Many economically important genera found 
in intertidal and subtidal habitats, such as Porphyra purpurea  and P. umbilicalis , belong to this 
class; they are harvested for human food across the North Atlantic and are under development 
as aquaculture crops for human and animal foods. Porphyra  species (Figures 1.1c and 1.33) are 
important reference red algae because of their multicellularity, high stress tolerance (e.g., to 
heat, freezing, high light, osmotic stress, and desiccation), ancient fossil record of the Bangiales, 
and capacity to synthesize an array of storage carbohydrates and light-protection compounds. 
The life history of Bangiales such as Porphyra  spp. involves an alternation between the econom -
ically important foliose blade (haploid gametophyte) and the microscopic, filamentous, diploid 
conchocelis phase.
The class Compsopogonophyceae includes microscopic filamentous algae (e.g., Erythrocladia ; 
Figure 1.1d) to macroscopic multicellular species (e.g., Compsopogon ). They live in coastal sea -
water or freshwater. They possess two distinctive ultrastructural characters in combination: the 
association of Golgi bodies with ER instead of mitochondria, typical of almost all red algae, and the 
presence of a peripheral encircling thylakoid in the chloroplast. The color of chloroplasts is variable 
from greenish blue to red. Asexual reproduction occurs by monospores generated by the oblique 
division of vegetative cells. Sexual reproduction and alternation of generations are reported in the 
Erythropeltidales.
The Cyanidiophyceae are all unicellular, spherical, or elliptical in shape, growing in volcanic 
and thermal areas under extremely low pH (0.05–5) and relatively high temperature (35–56°C). 
Unlike most eukaryotes, they are also capable of tolerating a large array of toxic chemical com -
pounds such as sulfuric acid, arsenic, and other heavy metals. They reproduce by binary fission 
(Cyanidioschyzon ; Figure 1.1e) or by formation of endospores ( Cyanidium , Galdieria ); they can be 
facultative heterotrophs or obligate photoautotrophs.
The Florideophyceae (Figures 1.1f and 1.38) includes all multicellular genera, both marine and 
freshwater, in which the gametophytes have chloroplasts with a peripheral encircling thylakoid, and 
the Golgi is associated with both ER and mitochondrion. The class contains species as seemingly 
different as the coralline algae, characterized for the presence of calcite and Botryocladia , known 
as sea-grapes, and parasitic taxa. These algae show a triphasic reproduction cycle: an isomorphic 
gametophyte and sporophyte generations are separated by the carposporophyte, a very different 
sporophyte that emerges from the development of the zygote. In general, carposporophyte is a set of 
small filaments that terminate in diploid spores, carpospores. These disperse and germinate to form 
the sporophyte. This is generally pseudoparenchymatous and identical to the gametophyte.
The three classes of Porphyridiophyceae (Figure 1.1g), Rhodellophyceae (Figure 1.1h), and 
Stylonematophyceae (Figure 1.1i) include the 10 recognized genera of unicellular red algae of 
the subphylum Rhodophytina. In the Porphyridiophyceae, the Golgi bodies are invariably associ -
ated with ER and a mitochondrion, while in the Rhodellophyceae the Golgi association can be 
either with ER or the functionally equivalent outer membrane of the nuclear envelope. The class 
Stylonematophyceae also includes pseudofilamentous or filamentous red algae. In the first two 
classes, reproduction occurs by cell division, while in the Stylonematophyceae reproduction occurs 
by both cell division and monospores.28 Algae

Members of this phylum are common inhabitants of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environ -
ments; within the phylum, a great range of somatic differentiation occurs, ranging from flagellates 
to complex multicellular thalli differentiated into macroscopic organs. The different level of thallus 
organization (unicellular, colonial, filamentous, siphonous, and parenchimatous) has traditionally 
served as the basis of classification of this division. Chlorophytes show a wide diversity in the num -
ber and arrangements of flagella associated with individual cells (one or up to eight, in the apical 
or subapical region). All members of the chlorophytes have motile stages with two or four anterior 
isokont flagella (i.e., flagella are of equal length and possess equivalent function), although algae 
with two flagella of slightly unequal lengths have been described. Flagella are characterized by a 
“stellate structure”-type flagellar transition region. Within the cell, the flagellar basal bodies are 
associated with four microtubular rootlets, cruciately arranged, which alternate between two and 
FIGURE 1.37  A group of eight autospores of Glaucocystis nostochinearum  still retained within the parent 
cell wall. Scale bar: 10 μm.

cell, the basal bodies and rootlets can have a perfect cruciate pattern, with the basal bodies directly 
opposed (DO) or they can be offset in a clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) position.
According to the most recent classifications, Chlorophyta comprises the early-diverging prasino -
phytes, which gave rise to the core chlorophytes (including the early diverging Chloredendrophycae 
with the three major classes of Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, and Chlorophyceae), to the 
Pedinophyceae, sister class to the core chlorophytes, and the recently proposed group Palmophyllales.
The prasinophytes, as presently conceived, include a heterogeneous assemblage of unicellular 
motile algae, either naked or covered on their cell body and flagella by nonmineralized organic 
scales (Figures 1.1l and 1.39). They are predominantly marine planktonic, but also include several 
freshwater representatives. At present, nine prasinophyte clades are recognized, two of which have 
been recently accommodated into the two classes of Mamiellophyceae and Nephroselmidophyceae. 
Mamiellophyceae (Figure 1.1m) are typically solitary cells, with one or two chloroplasts, 
mono- or biflagellate, with isokont or anisokont flagella. They may be scale-covered or naked. 
Nephroselmidophyceae (Figure 1.1n) are laterally compressed, scale-covered cells, with laterally 
inserted anisokont flagella, and possess a single cup-shaped chloroplast. Pedinophyceae (Figure 
1.1o) are unicellular, monoflagellate asymmetrical algae, with CCW basal body orientation. Rigid or 
thin hair-like appendages are present on the flagellum. Chloredendrophyceae (Figure 1.1p) possess a 
pair of flagella inserted in a pit; basal body orientation is CCW. These algae are covered by organic 
scales, the outer layer of which is fused to form a theca. The class Chlorophyceae (Figure 1.1q) 
comprises mainly swimming cells with one or two pair of flagella, without mastigonemes. Cells can 
be naked or covered by a cell wall more or less calcified (Figure 1.40). Either DO or CW arrange -
ments are present in the members of this class. Ulvophyceae morphologies range from microscopic 
unicellular to macroscopic multicellular plants and giant-celled organisms (Figures 1.1r, 1.41, and 
1.42). Four main cytomorphological types can be distinguished: nonmotile uninucleate unicells; 
multicellular filaments or blades composed of multinucleate cells; multicellular bodies composed 
of multinucleate cells with nuclei organized in regularly spaced cytoplasmic domains; siphonous 
thalli consisting of a single giant tubular cell containing thousands to millions of nuclei. In some 
species, siphonous thalli are encrusted with calcium carbonate. The majority of Ulvophyceae are 
marine, but several members also occur in freshwater or damp subaerial habitats. All the algae of 
FIGURE 1.39  Unicell of Pyramimonas longicauda .31 General Overview
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthe class possess a CCW basal body orientation. The class Trebouxiophyceae (Figures 1.1s and 
1.43) encompasses motile and nonmotile unicells, colonies, and multicellular filaments or blades 
from freshwater or terrestrial habitats, with some species present also in brackish or marine water. 
Several species are either symbiotic with fungi to form lichens or endosymbiotic with freshwater 
and marine protists, invertebrates, and plants. Swimming cells can have one or two pair of flagella 
without mastigonemes. All the algae of the class possess a CCW basal body orientation. The class 
Dasycladophyceae (Figures 1.1t and 1.19) contains algae characterized by a siphounous organiza -
tion of the thallus, with numerous chloroplasts. This class is entirely marine.
As already stated, Palmophyllales (Figure 1.1u) are an early-diverging chlorophytic lineage; 
these algae are restricted to dimly lit habitats and deep water. They possess a unique type of multi -
cellularity, forming well-defined macroscopic bodies composed of small spherical cells embedded 
in a firm gelatinous matrix.
Chlorophyta possess chlorophylls a and b, β- and γ-carotene, and several xantophylls as acces -
sory pigments. Chloroplasts are surrounded by a two-membrane envelope without any ER mem -
brane. Within the chloroplasts, thylakoids are stacked to form grana. Pyrenoids, where present, 
FIGURE 1.40  Filament of Oedogonium  sp., with a Peranema  sp. cell. Scale bar: 20 μm.
FIGURE 1.41  Thallus of Codium  sp. Scale bar: 2 cm.32 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCare embedded within the chloroplast and often penetrated by thylakoids. The circular molecules of 
chloroplast DNA are concentrated in numerous small blobs (1–2 μm in diameter). The most impor -
tant reserve polysaccharide is starch, which occurs as grains inside the chloroplasts; glucan or β-1,4 
mannan can be present in the cell wall of some Ulvophyceae. Eyespot, if present, is located inside 
the chloroplast and consists of a layer of carotenoid-containing lipid droplets between the chloro -
plast envelope and the outermost thylakoids.
charophy Ta
Charophytes are the organisms most closely related to land plants. The six groups of the phy -
lum have been distinctly recognized on the basis of ultrastructural, biochemical, and molecular 
data. Mesostigmatophyceae (Figure 1.1v) and Chlorokybophyceae form the earliest branching 
FIGURE 1.42  Thallus of Trentepohlia arborum .
FIGURE 1.43  Group of Chlorella  sp. cells. Scale bar: 10 μm.33 General Overview
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCstreptophytes; the only genus of Mesostigmatophyceae is Mesotigma  with two species, M. viride  
and M.  grande . These isogamous algae are freshwater, scaly, asymmetrical, and unicellular 
biflagellate, and unlike other charophytes, possess two multilayered structures and an eyespot. 
Chlorokybophyceae (Figure 1.1z) consists of a sole representative, Chlorokybus atmophyticus , 
occurring in moist terrestrial habitats where it forms sarcinoid packets of a few cells enveloped in 
a common mucilaginous matrix, which reproduce asexually by asymmetrical motile spores pos -
sessing a single multilayered structure. Klebsormidiophyceae (Figure 1.1aa) represent the common 
ancestor of the remaining streptophytes, in which multicellularity evolved in the form of unbranched 
filaments (Figure 1.44). These freshwater or terrestrial algae, which can also form sarcinoid packets, 
reproduce by filament fragmentation and release of motile spores. Charophyceae (Figures 1.1ab and 
1.45) are the most plant-like in appearance among the charophytes, because of the independent evo -
lution of macrophytic forms. Thalli consist of a central stalk of large, elongated multinucleate cells 
and whorls of branches at nodes. All species are oogamous with motile sperm produced in complex 
antheridia. Coleochaetophyceae (Figure 1.1ac) range in morphology from branched filamentous 
algae to relatively complex discoid parenchymatous thalli. They may be epiphytic, endophytic, or 
loosely attached to submerged vascular plants or other substrates. They are oogamous, with bifla -
gellate zoospore and sperm. The Zygnematophyceae (Figure 1.1ad) are the most species-rich clade 
of the Charophyta and the most morphologycally diverse. Thalli include nonmotile unicells, fila -
ments, and small colonial forms (Figure 1.11). They possess an unusual mode of sexual reproduc -
tion by fusion of nonflagellate gametes. A very recent comprehensive genome scale analysis of 
160 nuclear genes drawn from species distributed across all the charophyte groups supported the 
Zygnematophyceae as the closest living relative to land plants.
hapTophy Ta
This phylum contains only two classes: Coccolitophyceae (Prymnesiophyceae; Figures 1.1ae, 1.1af, 
and 1.46) and Pavlovophyceae (Figure 1.1ag). The great majority of these algae are unicellular, 
motile, palmelloid, or coccoid, but a few form colonies or short filaments. These algae are generally 
found in marine habitats, although there are a number of records from freshwater and terrestrial 
FIGURE 1.44  Filament of Klebsormidium  sp.34 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCenvironments. Flagellate cells bear two naked flagella, inserted either laterally or apically, which 
may have different lengths. A structure apparently found only in algae of this division is the hapto -
nema, typically a long thin organelle reminiscent of a flagellum but with a different ultrastructure. 
The chloroplast contains only chlorophyll a, c1, and c2. The golden yellowish-brown appearance of 
chloroplast is due to the accessory pigments such as fucoxanthin, β-carotene, and other xanthins. 
Each chloroplast is enclosed within a fold of ER, which is continuous with the nuclear envelope. 
Thylakoids are stacked in threes and there are no girdle lamellae. The nucleic DNA is scattered 
throughout the chloroplast as numerous nucleoids. When present as in Pavlova  (Figure 1.1ag), 
the eyespot consists in a row of spherical globules inside the chloroplast; no associated flagellar 
FIGURE 1.45  Thallus of Nitella  sp.
FIGURE 1.46  Unicell of Helicosphaera carteri .35 General Overview

The cell surface is typically covered with tiny cellulosic scales or calcified scales bearing spoke-like 
fibrils radially arranged. Most haptophytes are photosynthetic, but heterotrophic nutrition is also 
possible. Phagothropy is present in the forms that lack a cell covering. A heteromorphic diplohap -
lontic life cycle has been reported, in which a diploid planktonic flagellate stage alternates with a 
haploid benthic filamentous stage.
crypTophy Ta
The unicellular flagellate belonging to the division Cryptophyta are asymmetric cells dorsiventrally 
constructed (Figure 1.47). They are mostly biflagellated, with two unequal, hairy flagella, subapi -
cally inserted, emerging from above a deep gullet located on the ventral side of the cell. The wall 
of this gullet is lined by numerous ejectosomes similar to trichocysts. Cryptophytes are typically 
free-swimming in freshwater and marine habitats; palmelloid phases can also be formed, and some 
members are known to be zooxanthellae in host invertebrates or within certain marine ciliate.
These algae possess only chlorophyll a and c2. Phycobilins are present in the thylakoid lumen 
rather than in phycobilisomes. The chloroplasts, one or two per cell, are bounded by four mem -
branes. The outermost membrane is continuous with the nuclear envelope and its surface is studded 
with ribosomes. Between the inner and outer membrane pairs is the periplastidial compartment, 
which contains the nucleomorph, the relict nucleus of the eukaryotic endosymbiont. Thylakoids 
are arranged in pairs, with no girdle lamellae. The pyrenoid projects out from the inner side of the 
chloroplast. The chloroplast DNA is condensed in small nucleoids scattered inside the chloroplast. 
The reserve polysaccharide accumulates in the periplastidial space as starch granules. Sometimes 
an eyespot formed by spherical globules is present inside the plastid, but it is not associated with 
the flagella. The cell is enclosed in a stiff, proteinaceous periplast, made by polygonal plates. Most 
forms are photosynthetic, but there are some colorless, heterotrophic. The primary method of repro -
duction is simply by longitudinal cell division, but sexual reproduction has also been documented.
ochrophy Ta
One of the defining features of the members of this division is that when two flagella are present, 
they are different. Flagellate stages, when present, are therefore termed heterokont, that is, they 
possess a long mastigonemate flagellum, which is directed forward during the swimming, and a 
FIGURE 1.47  Unicell of Cryptomonas  sp. Scale bar: 6 μm.36 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCshort smooth one that points backwards along the cell. These algae are mostly marine, but they can 
also be found in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They show a preponderance of carotenoids over 
chlorophylls that result in all groups having golden rather than grass green hue typical of other major 
algal division. The members of this division possess chlorophylls a, c1, c2, and c3 with the excep -
tion of the Eustigmatophyceae, Aurearenophyceae, and Ochromonas  (Chrysophyceae) that have only 
chlorophyll a. The principal accessory pigments are β-carotene, fucoxantin, and vaucheriaxanthin. 
The chloroplast is surrounded by four membranes: the normal plastidial double-membrane envelope, 
surrounded by a periplastidial membrane and by rough ER, which may be continuous with the outer 
membrane of the nuclear envelope. The periplastidial membrane is considered to be the remnants of 
the eukaryotic endosymbiont’s (a red alga) plasmalemma. The chloroplast interior is occupied by thy -
lakoids, which are grouped into stacks of three, called lamellae. One lamella usually runs along the 
whole periphery of the chloroplast, and is termed girdle lamella, absent only in the Eustigmatophyceae. 
The chloroplastic DNA is usually arranged in a ring-shaped nucleoid. Dictyochophyceae species pos -
sess several nucleoids scattered inside the chloroplast. The main reserve polysaccharide is chrysol -
aminarin, a β-1,3-glucan, located inside the cytoplasm in special vacuoles. The eyespot consists of a 
layer of globules, enclosed within the chloroplast, and together with the photoreceptor, located in the 
smooth flagellum, forms the photoreceptive apparatus. The member of this phylum can grow photo -
autrophycally, but can also combine different nutritional strategy such as heterotrophy (phagotrophy). 
The Ochrophyta species that reproduce sexually have a haplontic (e.g., Chrysophyceae), diplontic 
(e.g., Bacillariophyceae), or diplohaplontic (e.g., Phaeophyceae) life cycles. Chrysophyceae are pre -
dominantly single-celled flagellate individuals, but also coccoid, filamentous, and parenchymatous 
(Figures 1.1ai and 1.3). Most of these algae lack cell walls and have flagella inserted apically or slightly 
subapically. Cell coverings, when present, include organic scales, organic lorica, and cellulose cell 
wall. Xanthophyceae can be unicellular coccoids or flagellate, ameboid, or filamentous, but the most 
distinctive species are siphonous (Figures 1.1al and 1.18). Most Xanthophyceae are freshwater or soil 
algae, but a few are marine. All known species of Eustigmatophyceae are green coccoid unicells 
either single, in pairs or in colonies, which exhibit little morphological diversity (Figures 1.1am and 
1.2). They are found in fresh, brackish, and seawater, as well as soil environments. Bacillariophyceae 
or diatoms are a group of unicellular brown pigmented cells that are encased by a unique type of 
silica wall, composed of two overlapping frustules that fit together like a box and lid (Figures 1.1an, 
1.48, and 1.49). They are both marine and freshwater. Raphidopyceae are all unicellular autotrophic 
cells (Figures 1.1ao and 1.50), relatively big in size (30–80 μm), and globoid to ovoidal elongated

quently, the shape of the cell can vary with external conditions. They possess both trycocysts and 
mucocysts. Dictyochophyceae are naked unicells that bear a single flagellum, anteriorly directed, 
with mastigonemes (Figures 1.1ap and 1.51). The class includes the silicoflagellates, a group char -
acterized by formation of a silicified skeleton, and organically scaled members. Phaeophyceae are 
multicellular, from branched filaments to massive, and complex parenchymatous kelp (Figures 1.1aq 
and 1.52). Flagellated stages possess two flagella usually laterally inserted, one anteriorly and one 
posteriorly directed. Cells show an alginate and cellulose wall. Pelagophyceae includes ciliated and 
coccoid members; cells can bear a single flagellum anteriorly directed, or two flagella, the second 
posteriorly directed (Figure 1.1ar). Bolidophyceae are flagellated picoplanktonic algae, considered 
as the closest, although separated lineage to diatoms (Figure 1.1as). Schizocladophyceae contains a

containing alginates but lacking cellulose (Figure 1.1at). Chrysomerophyceae are filamentous marine 
or brackish algae, epiphytic on halophytes, or algae (Figure 1.1au). Picophagophyceae contains both 
photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic phagothrophs with filopodia or reticulopodia; the status of 
these algae as a distinct class has been questioned (Figure 1.1av). Pinguiophyceae are all single-celled 
microalgae from picoplankton size to over 40 μm (Figure 1.1az). They deserve mentioning because 
of the unusually high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentanoic acid

FIGURE 1.52  Frond of Bellotia eriophorum . Scale bar: 5 cm.39 General Overview
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC(20:5, n-3); this peculiarity is the basis for the choice of the Latin noun pingue  (adj. fat) as the root for 
the class name. Placidiophyceae are kidney-shaped unicell with two flagella arising from a subapical 
region of the flattened ventral side. Cells that are usually attached to the substratum can glide or swim 
freely. They ingest prey particles on the posterior ventral side (Figure 1.1ba). Phaeothanmniophyceae 
can be filamentous (Figure 1.1bb), palmelloid, or coccoid; the vegetative cells are surrounded by a 
distinct cell wall of varying thickness. During cell division, an entirely new cell wall is formed inside 
the parent cell wall, that is, the new walls are formed by eleutheroschisis. Swimming stages have 
flagella inserted laterally. Synchromophyceae cell types can be sessile, migrating, and floating amoe -
bae, surrounded by a lorica usually with one ostiole, through which reticulopodia protrude and fuse 
with neighboring cell to build up a meroplasmodium (Figure 1.1bc). The most striking and unique 
morphological feature of these algae is the aggregation of chloroplasts, each with two membranes, 
into groups of up to eight enclosed in a common periplastidial membrane and epiplastid rough ER. 
Synurophyceae are unicellular and colonial algae, important components of the species composition 
and biomass in freshwater environment worldwide (Figures 1.1bd and 1.5). A well-organized cell 
covering of siliceous, overlapping scales is characteristic of the class. These scales are morphologi -
cally unique for each species, and observations made with electron microscopy usually are required 
for species-level identification. They differ from closely related Chrysophyceae in the presence of 
only chlorophyll c1, the parallel basal body orientation and the lack of eyespot. Aurearenophyceae 
(Figure 1.1be), a recently established class, are nonmotile algae, surrounded by a cell wall, with two 
unequal flagella lying inside the cell wall, or cells naked, motile, and biflagellate.
cercozoa —chlorarachniophyceae
Chlorarachniphyceae are naked, uninucleate cells that form a net-like plasmodium via filopodia (Figures 
1.1bf, 1.53a, and 1.53b). The basic life cycle of these algae comprises ameboid, coccoid, and flagellate 
cell stages. The ovoid zoospores bear a single flagellum that during the swimming wraps around the 
cell. Chlorachniophytes are marine. They possess chlorophyll a and b. Each chloroplast has a promi -
nent projecting pyrenoid and is surrounded by four envelope membranes. Thylakoids are grouped in 
stacks of 1–3. A nucleomorph is present between the second and third membranes of the chloroplast 
envelope. The origin of this organelle is different from the origin of the cryptophyte nucleomorph, since 
the chlorachniophytes came from a green algal endosymbiont. Paramylon ( β-1,3-glucan) is the storage 
carbohydrate. They can phototrophic and phagotrophic, engulfing bacteria, flagellates, and eukaryotic 
algae. Asexual reproduction is carried out by either normal mitotic cell division or zoospore formation. 
Sexual reproduction characterized by heterogamy has been reported for only two species.
myzozoa —dinophyceae
Dinophyceae are typical unicellular flagellates, but can be also nonflagellate, ameboid, coccoid, 
palmelloid, or filamentous (Figures 1.1bg, 1.1bh, 1.54, and 1.55). Dinoflagellates have two flagella 
with independent beating pattern, one training, one girdling that confer characteristic rotatory 
swimming whirling motion. Flagella can be apically inserted (desmokont-type) or emerging from 
a region close to the midpoint of the ventral side of the cell (dinokont-type). Most dinoflagellates 
are characterized by cell-covering components that lie beneath the cell membrane. Around the cell, 
there is a superficial layer of flat, polygonal vesicles, which can be empty or filled with cellulose 
plates. In dinokont-type dinoflagellates, these thecal plates generally form a bipartite armor, consist -
ing of an upper, anterior half and a lower, posterior half, separated by a groove known as cingulum, 
where the transversal flagellum is located (Figure 1.55). A smaller groove, the sulcus, extends poste -
riorly from the cingulum and hosts the longitudinal flagellum. The two flagella emerge from a pore 
located at the intersection of the two grooves. Very often dinoflagellates are important components 
of the microplankton of freshwater and marine habitats. Though most are too large (2–2000 μm) to 
be consumed by filter feeders, they are readily eaten by larger protozoa, rotifer, and planktivorous 40 Algae

thellae) of tropical corals. Dinoflagellates possess chlorophylls a, c1, and c2, fucoxanthin, other 
carotenoids, and xanthophylls such as peridinin, gyroxanthin diester, dinoxanthin, diadinoxantin, 
and fucoxanthin. The chloroplasts, where present, are surrounded by three membranes. Within the 
chloroplasts typical pyrenoids are present, the thylakoids are for the most part united in a stack of 3. 
The chloroplast DNA is localized in small nodules scattered in the whole chloroplast. A really com -
plex photoreceptive system is present in the dinophytes such as Warnowia polyphemus , W. pulcra , 
or Erythropsidinium agile  consisting of a “compound eye” composed of a lens and a retinoid. Most 
dinoflagellates are distinguished by a dinokaryon, a special eukaryotic nucleus involving fibrillar 
chromosomes that remain condensed during the mitotic cycles. The principal reserve polysaccha -
ride is starch, located as grains in the cytoplasm, but oil droplets are present in some genera. At 
the surface of the cell, there are trichocysts that discharge explosively when stimulated. Besides 
photoautotrophy, dinoflagellates exhibit an amazing diversity of nutritional types since about half 
of the known species lack plastids and are therefore obligate heterotrophic. Some are notorious for 
nuisance blooms and toxin production, and many exhibit bioluminescence. Dinophyceae have gen -
erally a haplontic life history.
eUglenozoa —eUglenophyceae
Euglenophyceae include mostly unicellular flagellates, although colonial species are common 
(Figures 1.1bi, 1.1bl, 1.1bm, 1.1bn, and 1.56). They are widely distributed, occurring in freshwater, 
but also brackish and marine waters, most soils and mud. They are especially abundant in highly 
heterotrophic environments. The flagella arise from the bottom of a cavity called reservoir, located 
in the anterior end of the cell. Cells can also ooze their way through mud or sand by a process 
known as metaboly, a series of flowing movements made possible by the presence of the pellicle, 
a proteinaceous wall that lies inside the cytoplasm. The pellicle can have a spiral construction and 
can be ornamented. The members of this division share their pigmentation with prochlorophytes, 
green algae, and land plants, since they have chlorophylls a and b, β- and γ-carotenes, and xan -
thins. However, plastids could be colorless or absent in some species. As in the Dinophyceae, the 
 chloroplast envelope consists of three membranes. Within the chloroplasts, the thylakoids are usu -
ally in groups of 3, without a girdle lamella; pyrenoids may be present. The chloroplast DNA occurs 
FIGURE 1.55  Dorsal view of Gonyaulax  sp., a brackish water dinoflagellate.42 Algae

free in the cytoplasm and the true photoreceptor located at the base of the flagellum can be consid -
ered unique among unicellular algae. The reserve polysaccharide is paramylon, β-1,3-glucan stored 
in granules scattered inside the cytoplasm, and not in the chloroplasts such as the starch of the 
Chlorophyta. Though possessing chlorophylls, these algae are not photoautotrophic but rather obli -
gate mixotrophic, because they require one or more vitamins of the B group. Some colorless genera 
are phagotrophic, with specialized cellular organelle for capture and ingestion of prey, while some 
other are osmotrophic. Some of the pigmented genera are facultative heterotrophic. Only asexual 
reproduction is known in this division. Euglenophyceae possess unique cellular and biochemical 
features that place these microorganisms closer to trypanosomes than to any other algal group.
ENDOSYMBIOSIS AND ORIGIN OF EUKARYOTIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS
The origin of cyanobacteria can be equated with the origin of aerobic photosynthesis around 2.8 
billion years ago, in the Archaean Era of earth history. From that time to present, cyanobacteria 
have played fundamental roles in driving much of the ocean carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen fluxes, 
establishing a major turning point in the biogeochemistry of our planet. Prior to the appearance of 
these organisms, all photosynthetic organisms were anaerobic bacteria that used light to couple the 
reduction of carbon dioxide to the oxidation of low free energy molecules, such as H2S or preformed 
organics. Cyanobacteria developed a key characteristic that distinguished them from their photosyn -
thetic evolutionary precursors, that is the ability to extract electrons from water releasing oxygen as 
a byproduct, with the help of two photosystems linked in series. Oxygenic photosynthesis exploits 
the energy of visible light to oxidize water and simultaneously reduces CO2 to organic carbon repre -
sented by (CH2O)n. Light energy is used as a substrate and chlorophyll a as a requisite catalytic agent.
Formally oxygenic photosynthesis can be summarized as

Thanks to endosymbiosis, the photosynthetic trait was acquired in the founding group of photo -
synthetic eukaryotes, the Plantae or Archaeplastida, and spread to give rise to the wide variety of 
photosynthetic eukaryotes on earth today. The origin of plastids in eukaryotic cells about 1.8 bil -
lion years ago is one of the most profound effects of the endosymbiotic process. These organelles 
have been well established to have evolved from a single so-called “primary endosymbiotic event” 
involving the uptake of a β-cyanobacterium by a heterotrophic/phagotrophic eukaryote, whose 
ancestors had already acquired a mitochondrion via endosymbiosis of a proteobacterium. Plastid 
genomes rarely encode more than 200 proteins, which represent a small fraction of the proteins 
required for full functionality, and an even smaller fraction of the few thousand proteins found in 
FIGURE 1.56  Unicell of Euglena gracilis . Scale bar: 10 μm.43 General Overview
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCmodern-day cyanobacteria. It is widely assumed that in the process of endosymbiosis, most endo -
symbiont genes were either lost together with the corresponding function or transferred to the host 
nucleus and merged into the chromosomes during the course of plastid integration. This migration 
of genes between two genomes is known as endosymbiotic gene transfer, a special case of horizon -
tal gene transfer (HGT). Over time, some acquired targeting sequences that enabled their products 
synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes were targeted back to the organelle. In addition, some host 
genes acquired targeting sequences that enabled their products to be imported into the organelle. 
All these processes played a fundamental role in the integration of endosymbiont and host.
“Primary plastids” are surrounded by two bounding membranes and are only found in three major 
eukaryotic photosynthetic groups of Plantae, that is, Glaucophyta, Chlorophyta, and Rhodopyta.
Glaucophyta occupy a key position in the evolution of plastids; in fact, the plastids of  glaucophytes 
contain chlorophyll a, present in cyanobacteria, and retain the remnant of a Gram-negative bacte -
rial peptidoglycan wall that would have been between the two membranes of the cyanobacterial 
ancestor symbiont. The retention of this ancestral character is absent in both green and red plastids.
Chlorophyta (green algae and plants) constitute the second lineage of primary plastids. The 
simple two-membrane system surrounding the plastid, the congruence of phylogenies based on 
nuclear and organellar genes, and the antiquity of the green algae in the fossil record all indicate 
that the green algal plastid is of primary origin. In these chloroplasts, chlorophyll b was synthesized 
as a secondary pigment, phycobiliproteins were lost, and starch was stored. Another hypothesis 
suggested that the photosynthetic ancestor of green lineage was a prochlorophyte that possessed 
chlorophylls a and b and lacked phycobiliproteins.
The green lineage played a major role in oceanic food webs and the carbon cycle from about 2.2 
billion years ago until the end-Permian extinction, approximately 250 million years ago. It was this 
similarity to the pigments of plants that led to the inference that the ancestors of land plants (i.e., 
embryophytes) would be among the green algae and is clear that phylogenetically plants are a group 
of green algae adapted to life on land.
The plastids of Rhodophyta (red algae) constitute the third primary plastid lineage. Like the 
green algae, the red algae are also an ancient group in the fossil record, and some of the oldest fos -
sils interpreted as being of eukaryotic origin are often referred to the red algae, although clearly 
these organisms were very different from any extant alga. Like those of green algae, the plastids 
of red algae are surrounded by two membranes. However, they are pigmented with chlorophyll a, 
phycobiliproteins, organized into phycobilisomes, and are distinguished by the presence of phyco -
erithrin. Phycobilisomes are relatively large extrinsic antennas, water-soluble, and attached to the 
surface of the thylakoid membrane. Thylakoids with phycobilisomes do not form stacks like those 
in other plastids and consequently the plastids of red algae (and glaucophytes) bear an obvious ultra -
structural resemblance to cyanobacteria.
Though the plastids of these three lineages are all primary plastids, that is, having only two 
membranes around them, they differ more noticeably in their light-harvesting machinery. Green 
algae and plants have membrane-intrinsic antenna proteins (members of the light-harvesting com -
plex superfamily) that bind both chlorophylls a and b and are associated with both photosystems. 
Red algae have proteins of the same family that bind only chlorophyll a and are associated with 
photosystem I. Glaucophytes do not have this type of antenna, but along with the red algae they have 
phycobilisomes, extrinsic antennas which bind linear tetrapyrroles.
Molecular phylogeny supports two possible evolutionary scenarios for the branching order 
within Plantae, the red-first and glaucophyte-first hypotheses. The inability to unambiguously 
decide between these two using genome-wide analyses may be explained by the more than 1 bil -
lion years that have passed since primary endosymbiosis. The early period of Plantae evolution was 
likely characterized by a rapid radiation, reticulate evolution (by HGT) among taxa, and high rates 
of gene divergence, loss, and replacement that have diffused the evolutionary signal. This idea is 
supported by the findings regarding mitochondrial gene order and gene content that do not favor a 
particular order of branching.44 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCAs ancient as the primary endosymbiotic origin of plastid was (1.8 billion years ago), it is worth 
noting that cases of “recent” cyanobacterium–eukaryote endosymbiosis are known, for example, 
in the testate amoeba Paulinella cromatophora  and the diatom Rhopalodia gibba . The photosyn -
thetic consortium between Paulinella  and an α-cyanobacterium was established 60 million years 
ago. This amoeba is surrounded by the cell wall called theca, which is composed of silica scales. 
Apart from typical eukaryotic organelles such as nucleus and mitochondria, it harbors two cyano -
bacterium-derived endosymbionts. The endosymbionts are photosynthetically active, deeply inte -
grated with the host cell, and their genome has been reduced to one-third in comparison to their 
cyanobacterial ancestors. The pennate diatom R. gibba  harbors endosymbionts closely related to 
extant cyanobacteria. Some of the closest free-living relatives of these so-called spheroid bodies 
are  diazotrophic cyanobacteria of the Cyanothece  sp. group. The spheroid bodies encode genes for 
nitrogen fixation and have the capacity to fix molecular nitrogen under light conditions only, unlike 
all other unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Although the spheroid bodies are of cyanobacte -
rial origin, they lack the typical photosynthetic pigmentation.
Plantae, that is, Glaucophyta, Chlorophyta, and Rhodopyta, represent just the beginning of the 
endosymbiosis story. In fact, while mitochondria originated once and have apparently never been 
lost, plastids have spread between eukaryotic lineages several times in events referred to as second -
ary and tertiary endosymbiosis, that is, the uptake and retention of a primary or secondary algal cell 
by another eukaryotic lineage.
Euglenozoa and Cercozoa derived from this primary plastid lineage by two separate secondary 
endosymbiosis acquiring the plastid by engulfing a green alga. Two independent lineages of green 
algae were captured by two distinct lineages of phagotrophic protists via secondary endosymbiosis; 
chloroplast genome analyses suggest that the chlorarachniophyte plastid is derived from a green 
alga belonging to the “core chlorophyte” group (Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae, Chlorophyceae), 
while the ancestor of the euglenophyte plastid is related to prasinophyte green algae. There is 
no strong similarity between the plastid of euglenids and chlorarachniophytes: euglenids have 
plastids bounded by three membranes and store paramylon in the cytosol, whereas chlorarachnio -
phytes have plastids bounded by four membranes with a nucleomorph and store β-1,3-glucan in 
the cytosol.
Euglenozoa contains photoautotrophic species and species with different types of feeding strat -
egies, osmotrophic (e.g., Rhabdomonas ) or phagotrophic (e.g., Peranema ). The plastids have been 
subsequently and independently lost in several branches within the phototrophic clade. Current 
knowledge on the phylogeny of euglenozoa implies that the secondary endosymbiotic event hap -
pened after the split of Peranema , but before the split of Eutreptia  and Eutreptiella , which form 
the basal lineages of the phototrophic clade. Recently, a number of red algal origin genes have 
been identified in the photosynthetic Euglena gracilis  as well as in the heterotrophic Peranema.  
It is likely that these genes have been acquired via eukaryote-to-eukaryote lateral gene transfer, 
giving rise to a complex pattern of genome mosaicism in euglenids. These genes may come from 
prey organisms, and the lineage of euglenids might have experienced a cryptic red algal plastid 
endosymbiosis before the current green algal plastid was established. Derived genes may have 
contributed to the successful integration and functioning of the green algal secondary plastid in 
modern-day euglenids.
Multiple red algal-derived Calvin cycle genes have been detected also in Cercozoa 
(Chlorarachniophyta) nuclear genomes. One possible explanation is that these genes were trans -
ferred from red alga prey organisms via HGT. The prey organism might have been captured by and 
retained in an ancestral and probably nonphotosynthetic chlorarachniophyte as an endosymbiont, 
which was then replaced by a green algal endosymbiont, giving rise to the extant secondary plastid 
in Chlorarachniophyta.
The plastid of cryptophytes, ochrophytes, dinoflagellates, and haptophytes likely arose from a sin -
gle initial event of secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga with a nonphotosynthetic eukaryotic host.45 General Overview
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
The red alga eventually evolved chlorophyll c plastids and engaged in several subsequent higher-
order endosymbiosis with phylogenetically diverse hosts (in an order still to be resolved), hence giv -
ing rise to all the extant photosynthetic lineages. The derivation of chlorophyll c containing plastids 
from the red algal lineage is still somewhat conjectural, but recent analyses of both gene sequences 
and gene content are consistent with this conclusion.
The cryptophytes were the first group in which secondary plastids were recognized, on the basis 
of their complex four-membrane structure. Like red algae, they have chlorophyll a and phycobili -
proteins, but these are distributed in the intrathylakoidal space rather than in the phycobilisomes 
found in red algae, Glaucophyta, and Cyanophyta. In addition, cryptomonads possess a second type 
of chlorophyll, chlorophyll c, which is found in the plastids of the remaining red lineage clades, 
retain the nucleomorph, vestigial nucleus of their symbiont, and have starch the reserve polysac -
charide of red algae in the periplastid space.
Ochrophyta (including kelps, diatoms, chrysophytes, and related groups), Haptophyta (the coc -
colithophorids), and probably those dinoflagellates (Myzozoa) pigmented with peridinin, have chlo -
rophylls a and c, along with a variety of carotenoids. Stacked thylakoids are found in those lineages 
that lack phycobilisomes.
The plastid situation in dinoflagellate is exceptionally complex; most of the phototrophic spe -
cies harbor a plastid of red algal origin bound by three membranes and characterized by the 
carotenoid peridinin, chlorophylls a and c2. It has been speculated that the ancestral peridinin-
containing chloroplast was replaced by one from a cryptophyte, a haptophyte, a diatom, or a 
green alga, that is, by additional endosymbiotic events, namely tertiary endosymbiosis in the 
first three cases, and serial secondary endosymbiosis for the green alga. All these symbiotic rela -
tionships have not reached the same level of permanence, and sometimes it is disputed whether 
the plastids are the traces of a stable symbiosis or rather they are kleptoplastids, that is, plas -
tids obtained from ingested algal prey and retained, which may remain temporarily functional 
and be used for photosynthesis by the predator. In some cases, the endosymbiont is present in 
an almost unchanged form and was therefore established more recently (e.g., Kryptoperidinium 
foliaceum ). In other cases, the symbiont has almost lost all organelles and only the chloroplast 
remains (e.g., peridinin-containing species, Heterocapsa , Peridinium ), indicating an older, more 
well-  established symbiosis.
Members of the Kareniaceae ( Karenia mikimotoi , Karlodinium micrum ) possess fucoxanthins 
as accessory pigment instead of peridinin; molecular data confirmed that the peridinin-contain -
ing chloroplast in this group has been superseded by a haptophyte-type-containing fucoxan -
thin. Other dinoflagellates such as Dinophysis acuminata  have established a stable symbiosis 
with a cryptophyte symbiont, of which only the chloroplast remains, surrounded by three mem -
branes. A diatom symbiont is present in a small group of closely related dinoflagellates named 
“dinotoms” consisting of only 10 species such as Durinskia baltica , K. foliaceum , Peridinium 
quinquecorne , and other species belonging to the genera Galeidinium  and Gymnodinium . The 
endosymbionts have been shown to originate from three different diatom lineages, one pen -
nate and two centric. Despite the loss of a distinctive cell wall, motility, and ability to divide 
mitotically, these endosymbionts have retained a large nucleus with vast amount of DNA, a large 
volume of cytoplasm, separate from the host by a single membrane, and their own mitochondria 
in addition to the chloroplasts. Another unique symbiosis is present in the dinoflagellate genus 
Lepidodinium ; members of this genus such as L. viride  (Figure 1.1bh; courtesy of Francisco 
Rodriguez Hernandez) and Lepidodinium chlorophorum  (formerly Gymnodinium chloropho -
rum) possess green-colored plastids containing chlorophylls a and b. The pigment composition, 
phylogenetic analyses of plastid-encoded genes, and a survey of nuclear genes encoding plastid-
targeted proteins in L. chlorophorum  clearly indicated that the ancestral Lepidodinium  cells 
replaced the original Chl- a + c-containing plastids with the Chl- a + b-containing plastids of 
an endosymbiotic green alga belonging to the core chlorophytes. Only the symbiont chloroplast 46 Algae

remains in these dinoflagellates. A schematic drawing of the hypothesis of the different symbi -
otic events is shown in Figure 1.57.

Anatomy
CYTOMORPHOLOGY AND ULTRASTRUCTURE
The description of the algal cell will proceed from the outside structures to the inside components. 
Details will be given only for those structures that are not comparable with analog structures found 
in most animals and plants. The reader is referred to a general cell biology textbook for the structure 
not described in the following.
oUTside  The cell
Cell surface forms the border between the external world and the inside of the cell. It serves a num -
ber of basic functions, including species identification, uptake and excretion/secretion of various 
compounds, protection against desiccation, pathogens, and predators, cell signaling, and cell–cell 
interaction. It serves as an osmotic barrier, preventing free flow of material, and as a selective bar -
rier for the specific transport of molecules. Algae, besides naked membranes more typical of animal 
cells and cell walls similar to those of higher plant cells, possess a wide variety of cell surfaces. The 
terminology used to describe surface structure of cells of algae is sometimes confusing; to avoid 
this confusion, or at least to reduce it, we will adopt a terminology mainly based on that of Preisig 
et al. (1994).
Cell surface structures can be grouped into four different basic types:
• Simple cell membrane (Type 1)
• Cell membrane with additional extracellular material (Type 2)
• Cell membrane with additional intracellular material in vesicles (Type 3)
• Cell membrane with additional intracellular and extracellular material (Type 4)
Type 1—Simple Cell Membrane
This cell surface consists of a simple or modified plasma membrane. The unit membrane is a lipid 
bilayer, 7–8-nm thick, rich with integral and peripheral proteins. Several domains exist in the mem -
brane, each distinguished by its own molecular structure. Some domains have characteristic car -
bohydrate coat enveloping the unit membrane. The carbohydrate side chains of the membrane, 
glycolipids, and glycoproteins form the carbohydrate coat. Difference in the thickness of plasma 
membrane may reflect differences in the distribution of phospholipids, glycolipids, and glycopro -
teins (Figure 2.1).
A simple plasma membrane is present in the zoospores and gametes of Chlorophyceae 
(Chlorophyta), Xanthophyceae (Ochrophyta), and Phaeophyceae (Ochrophyta), in the zoospores of 
the Eustigmatophyceae (Ochrophyta), and in the spermatozoids of Bacillariophyceae (Ochrophyta). 
This type of cell surface usually characterizes very short-lived stages and, in this transitory naked 
phase, the naked condition is usually rapidly lost once zoospores or gametes have ceased swimming 
and have become attached to the substrate, since wall formation rapidly ensues. A simple cell mem -
brane covers the uninucleate cells that form the net-like plasmodium of the Chlorarachniophyceae 
(Cercozoa) during all their life history. Most Chrysophyceae occur as naked cells, whose plasma 
membrane is in direct contact with water, but in Ochromonas , the membrane is covered with both 250 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCa carbohydrate coat and surface blebs and vesicles, which may serve to trap bacteria and other par -
ticles that are subsequently engulfed as food. The properties of the membrane or its domains may 
change from one stage in the life cycle to the next.
Type 2—Cell Surface with Additional Extracellular Material
Extracellular matrices occur in various forms and include mucilage and sheaths, scales, frustule, 
cell walls, loricas, and skeleta.
The terminology used to describe this membrane-associated material is quite confusing, and 
unrelated structures such as the frustule of diatoms, the fused scaled covering of some prasyno -
phyceae, and the amphiesma of dinoflagellates have been given the same name, that is, theca. Our 
attempt has been to organize the matter in a less confusing way (at least in our opinion).
Mucilages and Sheaths
These are general terms for some sort of outer gelatinous covering present in both prokaryotic 
and eukaryotic algae. Mucilages are always present and we can observe a degree of development 
of a sheath that is associated with the type of the substrate the cells contact (Figure 2.2). All cya -
nobacteria secrete a gelatinous material, which, in most species, tends to accumulate around the 
cells or trichome in the form of an envelope or sheath. Coccoid species are thus held together to 
form colonies; in some filamentous species, the sheath may function in a similar manner, as in 
the formation of Nostoc  balls, or in development of the firm, gelatinous hemispherical domes of 
the marine Phormidium crosbyanum . Most commonly, the sheath material in filamentous species 
forms a thick coating or a tube through which motile trichomes move readily. Sheath production 
is a continuous process in cyanobacteria, and variation in this investment may reflect different 
physiological stages or levels of adaptation to the environment. Under some environmental condi -
tions, the sheath may become pigmented, although it is normally colorless and transparent. Ferric 
hydroxide or other iron or metallic salts as well as pigments originating within the cell may accu -
mulate in the sheath. Only a few cyanobacterial exopolysaccharides have been defined structur -
ally; the sheath of Nostoc commune  contains cellulose-like glucan fibrils cross-linked with minor 
monosaccharides and that of Mycrocystis flos-aquae  consists mainly of galacturonic acid, with a 
composition similar to that of pectin. Cyanobacterial sheaths appear as a major component of soil 
crusts found throughout the world, from hot desert to polar regions, protecting soil from erosion, 
favoring water retention and nutrient bio-mobilization, and affecting chemical weathering of the 
environment they colonize.
FIGURE 2.1  Schematic drawing of a simple cell membrane.51 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCIn eukaryotic algae, mucilages and sheaths are present in diverse divisions. The most com -
mon occurrence of this extracellular material is in the algae palmelloid phases, in which non -
motile cells are embedded in a thick, more or less stratified, sheath of mucilage. This phase 
is so called because it occurs in the genus Palmella  (Chlorophyceae), but it is also present in 
other members of the same class, such as Asterococcus  sp., Hormotila  sp., and Gloeocystis  
sp. A palmelloid phase is also present in Spirogyra  sp. (Zygnematophyceae), Chroomonas  sp. 
(Cryptophyceae), Gloeodinium montanum  vegetative cells (Dinophyceae) Euglena gracilis  
(Euglenophyceae) (Figure 1.22). Less common are the cases in which filaments are covered 
by continuous tubular layers of mucilages and sheath. It occurs in the filaments of Geminella  
sp. (Trebouxiophyceae). A more specific covering exists in the filaments of Phaeothamnion  
sp. (Phaeothamniophyceae), since under certain growth conditions, cells of the filaments dis -
sociate and produce a thick mucilage that surround them in a sort of colony resembling the 
palmelloid phase.
Scales
Scales can be defined as organic or inorganic surface structures of distinct size and shape. Scales 
can be distributed individually or arranged in a pattern sometimes forming an envelope around 
the cell. They occur only in eukaryotic algae, in the divisions of Ochrophyta, Haptophyta, and 
Chlorophyta. They can be as large as the scales of Haptophyta (1 μm), but also as small as the scales 
of Prasynophytes (Chlorophyta) (50 nm). There are at least three distinct types of scales: nonmin -
eralized scales, made up entirely of organic matter, primarily polysaccharides, which are present 
in the Prasynophytes (Chlorophyta); scales consisting of calcium carbonate crystallized onto an 
organic matrix, as the coccoliths produced by many Haptophyta; and scales constructed of silica 
deposited on a glycoprotein matrix, formed by some members of the Ochrophyta.

arrows point to the mucilaginous sheath of this cyanobacterium. Inside the cell, osmiophylic eyespot globules 
are present. Scale bar, 0.15 μm. (Courtesy of Prof. Patrizia Albertano.)52 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCMost taxa of the Prasinophytes (Chlorophyta) possess several scale types per cell, arranged in 
1–5 layers on the surface of the cell body and flagella, those of each layer having a unique morphol -
ogy for that taxon. These scales consist mainly of acidic polysaccharides involving unusual 2-keto 
sugar acids, with glycoproteins as minor components. Members of the order Pyramimonadales 
such as Pyramimonas  sp. exhibit one of the most complex scaly covering among the Prasinophytes. 
It consists of three layers of scales. The innermost scales are small, square, or pentagonal; the 
intermediate scales are either naviculoid or spider web-shaped or box-shaped (Figure 2.3); the 
outer layer consists of large basket or crown-shaped scales. It is generally accepted that scales of 
the Prasinophytes are synthesized within the Golgi apparatus; developing scales are transported 
through the Golgi apparatus by cisternal progression to the cell surface and released by exocytosis. 
In some genera such as Tetraselmis  (Chlorodendrophyceae) and Scherffelia  (Chlorodendrophyceae), 
the cell body is covered entirely by fused scales. The scales consist mainly of acidic polysaccha -
rides. These scales are produced only during cell division. They are formed in the Golgi apparatus, 
and their development follow the route already described. After secretion, scales coalesce extracel -
lularly inside the parental covering to form a new cell wall.
In the Haptophyta, cells are typically covered with external scales of varying degree of complex -
ity, which may be unmineralized or calcified. The unmineralized scales consist largely of complex 
carbohydrates, including pectin-like sulfated and carboxylated polysaccharides, and cellulose-like 
polymers. The structure of these scales varies from simple plates to elaborate, spectacular spines 
and protuberances, as in Chrysochromulina  sp. (Coccolithophyceae) (Figure 2.4), or to the unusual 
spherical or clavate knobs present in some species of Pavlova  (Pavlovophyceae).
Calcified scales termed coccoliths are produced by the coccolithophorids, a large group of spe -
cies within the Haptophyta. In terms of ultrastructure and biomineralization processes, two very 
different types of coccoliths are formed by these algae: heterococcoliths (Figure 2.5) and holococ -
coliths (Figure 2.6). Some life cycles include both heterococcolith- and holococcolith-producing 
forms. In addition, there are a few haptophytes that produce calcareous structures that do not appear 
to have either heterococcolith or holococcolith ultrastructure. These may be products of further 
biomineralization processes, and the general term nannolith is applied to them.
Heterococcoliths are the most common coccolith type, which mainly consist of radial arrays of 
complex crystal units. The sequence of heterococcolith development has been described in detail in 
Pleurochrysis carterae  (Coccolithophyceae), Emiliana huxleyi  (Coccolithophyceae), and the non -
motile heterococcolith phase of Coccolithus pelagicus  (Coccolithophyceae). Despite the signifi -
cant diversity in these observations, a clear overall pattern is discernible in all cases. The process 
commences with formation of a precursor organic scale inside Golgi-derived vesicles; calcification 
FIGURE 2.3  Box-shaped scales of the intermediate layer of Pyramimonas  sp. cell body covering.53 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCoccurs within these vesicles with nucleation of a protococcolith ring of simple crystals around the 
rim of the precursor base-plate scale. This is followed by growth of these crystals in various direc -
tions to form complex crystal units. After completion of the coccolith, the vesicle dilates, its mem -
brane fuse with the cell membrane, and exocytosis occurs. Outside the cell, the coccolith joins other 
coccoliths to form the coccosphere, that is, the layer of coccoliths surrounding the cell (Figure 1.46).
Holococcoliths consist of large numbers of minute morphologically simple crystals. Studies 
have been performed on two holococcolith-forming species, the motile holococcolith phase of 
C.  pelagicus  and Calyptrosphaera sphaeroidea . As the heterococcoliths, the holococcoliths are 
also underlain by base-plate organic scales formed inside Golgi vesicles. However, holococcolith 
calcification is an extracellular process. Experimental evidences revealed that calcification occurs 
in a single highly regulated space outside the cell membrane, but directly above the stack of Golgi 
vesicles. This extracellular compartment is covered by a delicate organic envelope or “skin.” The 
cell secretes calcite that fills the space between the skin and the base-plate scales. The coccosphere 
FIGURE 2.4  Elaborate body scale of Chrysochromulina  sp.
FIGURE 2.5  Heterococcolith of Discosphaera tubifera .54 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCgrows progressively outward from this position. As a consequence of the different biomineraliza -
tion strategies, heterococcoliths are more robust than the smaller and more delicate holococcoliths.
Coccolithophorids, together with corals and foraminifera, are responsible for the bulk of oceanic 
calcification. Their role in the formation of marine sediment and the impact their blooms may exert 
on climate change will be discussed in Chapter 5.
Members of the Synurophyceae (Ochrophyta) such as Synura  sp. and Mallomonas  sp. are cov -
ered by armor of silica scales, with a very complicated structure. Synura  scales consist of a perfo -
rated basal plate provided with ribs, spines, and other ornamentation (Figure 2.7). In Mallomonas , 
scales may bear long, complicated bristles (Figure 2.8). Several scale types are produced in the 
same cell, and deposited on the surface in a definite sequence, following an imbricate, often screw-
like pattern. Silica scales are produced internally in deposition vesicles formed by the chrysoplast 
endoplasmic reticulum, which function as molds for the scales. Golgi body vesicles transporting 
material fuse with the scale-producing vesicles. Once formed, the scale is extruded from the cell 
and brought into correct position on the cell surface.
Frustule
This structure is present only in the Bacillariophyceae (Ochrophyta), commonly known as dia -
toms. The frustule is an ornate cell membrane made of amorphous hydrated silica, which displays 
intricate patterns and designs unique to each species. This silicified envelope consists of two over -
lapping valves, an epitheca and a slightly smaller hypotheca. Each theca is comprised of a highly 
patterned valve and one or more girdle bands (cingula) that extend around the circumference of the 
FIGURE 2.6  Holococcolith of Syracosphaera oblonga .
FIGURE 2.7  Ornamented body scale of Synura petersenii .55 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCcell, forming the region of theca overlay. Extracellular organic coats envelop the plasma membrane 
under the siliceous frustule. They exist in the form of both thick mucilaginous capsules and thin 
tightly bound organic sheaths. The formation of the frustule occurs in the silica deposition vesicles, 
derived from the Golgi apparatus. The vesicles eventually secrete their finished product onto the 
cell surface in a precise position.
Diatoms can be divided artificially in centric and pennate according to the symmetry of their 
frustule. In centric diatoms, the symmetry is radial, that is, the structure of the valve is arranged 
in reference to a central point (Figure 2.9). However, within the centric series, there also oval, 
FIGURE 2.8  Body scale of Mallomonas crassisquama .
FIGURE 2.9  Triceratium  sp., a centric diatom.56 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCtriradiate, quadrate, and pentagonal variation of this symmetry, with a valve arranged in reference 
to two, three, or more points. Pennate diatoms are bilaterally symmetrical about two axes, apical 
and trans-apical, or only in one axis (Figure 2.10); some genera possess rotational symmetry (Figure 
1.48). Valves of some pennate diatoms are characterized by an elongated fissure, the raphe, which 
can be placed centrally, or run along one of the edges. At each end of the raphe and at its center, 
there are thickening called polar and central nodules. Addiction details in the morphology of the 
frustule are the stria, lines composed of areolae, pores through the valve that can go straight through 
the structure, or can be constricted at one side. Striae can be separated by thickened areas called 
costae. Areolae are passageways for the gases, nutrient exchanges and mucilage secretion for move -
ment, and attachment to substrates or other cells of colony. Other pores, also known as portules, 
are present on the surface of the valve. There are two types of portules: fultoportulae (Figure 2.11), 
found only in the order Thalassiosirales, and rimoportulae (Figure 2.12), which are universal. The 
structure of the fultoportulae is an external opening on the surface of the valve extended or not into 
a protruding structure (Figure 2.11). The other end penetrates the silica matrix and is supported with 
2–5 satellite pores. The portules, themselves, function in the excretion of several materials, such as 
the β-chitin fibrils. These fibrils are manufactured in the conical invaginations in the matrix, under 
the portule. This may be the anchoring site for the protoplast. The rimoportula is similar to the 
FIGURE 2.10  Rhoicosphenia  sp., a pennate diatom.
FIGURE 2.11  Fultoportula of 
Thalassiosira  sp.
 FIGURE 2.12  Rimoportula of Stephanodiscus  sp.57 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCfultoportulae, except that it has a simpler inner structure. The rimoportula does not have satellite 
pores in the inner matrix. However, the rimoportula does have some elaborate outer structures that 
bend, have slits, or are capped. Sometimes the valve can outgrow beyond its margin in structures 
called setae that help link adjacent cells into linear colonies as in Chaetoceros  spp. or possesses  
protuberances as in Biddulphia  spp., which allow the cells to gather in zigzag chains (Figure 2.13). 
In other genera such as Skeletonema , the valve presents a marginal ridge along its periphery con -
sisting of long, straight spines, which make contact between adjacent cells, and unite them into 
filaments. Some genera also possess a labiate process, a tube through the valve with internally 
thickened sides that may be flat or elevated.
Diatoms are by far the most significant producer of biogenic silica, dominating the marine sili -
con cycle. It is estimated that over 30 million km2 of ocean floor are covered with sedimentary 
deposits of diatom frustules. The geological and economical importance of these silica coverings as 
well as the mechanism of silica deposition will be discussed in Chapter 4.
Cell Wall
A cell wall, defined as a rigid, homogeneous, and often multilayered structure, is present in both 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic algae.
In Cyanobacteria, the cell wall lies between the plasma membrane and the mucilaginous 
sheath; its fine structure is of Gram-negative type. The innermost layer, the electron-opaque layer 
or peptidoglycan layer, overlays the plasma membrane, and in most cyanobacteria its width varies 
between 1 and 10 nm, but can reach 200 nm in some Oscillatoria  species. Regularly arranged 
discontinuities are present in the peptidoglycan layer of many cyanobacteria; pores are located 
in single rows on either side of every cross-wall and are also uniformly distributed over the cell 
surface. The outer membrane of the cell wall appears as a double track structure tightly connected 
FIGURE 2.13  Cells of Biddulphia  sp.58 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCwith the peptidoglycan layer; this membrane exhibits a number of evaginations representing sites 
of extrusion of material from the cytoplasm through the wall into the slime. The cell wall of 
genera such as Prochloron  is comparable with that of the cyanobacteria in structure and contains 
muramic acid.
Eukariotic algal cell wall is always formed outside the plasmalemma and is in many respects 
comparable to that of higher plants. It is present in the Rhodophyta, Eustigmatophyceae 
(Ochrophyta) (Figure 2.14a and b), Phaeophyceae (Ochrophyta), Xanthophyceae (Ochrophyta), 
Chlorophyceae (Chlorophyta), and Charophyceae (Charophyta). Generally, cell walls are made 
up of two components, a microfibrillar framework embedded in an amorphous mucilaginous 
material composed of polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins. Encrusting substances such as silica, 
calcium carbonate, or sporopollenin may also be present. In the formation of algal cell walls, the 
material required are mainly collected into Golgi vesicles that then pass it through the plasma 
membrane, where enzyme complexes are responsible for synthesis of microfibrils, in a predeter -
minate direction.
In the Florideophyceae (Rhodophyta), the cell wall consists of more than 70% of water-soluble 
sulfated galactans such as agars and carrageenans, commercially very important in food and phar -
maceutical industry, because of their ability to form gels. In the Phaeophyceae (Ochrophyta), cell 
wall mucilagine is composed primarily of alginic acid; the salts of this acid have valuable emulsi -
fying and stabilizing properties. In the Xanthophyceae (Ochrophyta), the composition of the wall 
FIGURE 2.14  TEM image of Nannochloropsis  sp. in transversal section: (a) arrows point to the cell wall and 
(b) negative staining of the shed cell walls. Scale bar, 0.5 μm.59 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCis mainly cellulosic, while in the Chlorophyceae (Chlorophyta) xylose, mannose, and chitin may 
also be present in addition to cellulose. Some members of the Chlorophyceae (Chlorophyta) and 
Charophyceae (Charophyta) have calcified walls.
Lorica
These enveloping structures are present in some members of the class Chrysophyceae (Ochrophyta) 
such as Dinobryon  sp., or Chrysococcus  sp., and in some genera of the Chlorophyceae, such as 
Phacotus , Pteromonas , and Dysmorphococcus . These loricas are vase-shaped structure with a 
more or less wide apical opening, where the flagella emerge. These structures can be colorless, or 
dark and opaque due to impregnation of manganese and iron compounds. As can be expected, dif -
ferent shapes correspond to different species. In Dinobryon  sp., the lorica is an interwoven system 
of fine cellulose or chitin fibrils (Figure 2.15). In Chrysococcus  sp., it consists of imbricate scales. 
In Phacotus , the lorica is calcified, ornamented, and is composed of two cup-shaped parts that sepa -
rate at reproduction. In Pteromonas , the lorica extends into a projecting wing around the cell and is 
composed of two shell-like portions joined at the wings (Figure 2.16).
Skeleton
A siliceous skeleton is present in a small group of marine organisms called silicoflagellates, 
belonging to the class Dictyocophyceae (Ochrophyta). This skeleton is placed outside the plasma 
membrane; it is a three-dimensional structure resembling a flat basket, which consists of a system 
of branched tubular elements bearing spinose endings (Figure 1.51). The protoplast is contained 
inside the basket and has a spongy or frothy appearance, with a central dense region containing 
the nucleus and the perinuclear dictyosomes, and numerous cytoplasmic pseudopodia extend -
ing outward and containing the plastids. Sometimes a delicate cell covering of mucilage can be 
detected.

In this type of cell surface, the plasma is underlined by a system of flattened vesicles. An example 
is the complex outer region of dinoflagellates (Dinophyceae) termed amphiesma. Beneath the cell 
membrane that binds dinoflagellate motile cells, a single layer of vesicles (amphiesmal vesicles) 
is almost invariably present. The vesicles may contain cellulosic plates (thecal plates) in taxa that 
are thus termed thecate, or armored; or the vesicles may lack thecal plates, such taxa being termed 
athecate, or unarmored or naked. In athecate taxa, the amphiesmal vesicles play a structural role. In 
thecate taxa, thecal plates, one of which occurs in each vesicle, adjoin one another tightly along lin -
ear plate sutures, usually with the margin of one plate overlapping the margin of the adjacent plate. 
Cellulosic plates vary from very thin to thick and can be heavily ornamented by reticula or striae; 
trichocyst pores, which may lie in pits termed areolae, penetrate most of them.
A separate layer internal to the amphiesmal vesicles may develop. It is termed pellicle, though 
in the case of dinoflagellates the term “pellicle” refers to a surface component completely different 
from the euglenoid pellicle, hence with a completely different accepted meaning, and in our opinion 
its use should be avoided. The layer consists primarily of cellulose, sometimes with a dinosporine 
component, a complex organic polymer similar to sporopollenin that makes these algae fossiliz -
able. In some athecate genera, such as Noctiluca  sp., this layer forms reinforce the amphiesma, and 
the cells are termed pelliculate. This layer is also sometimes present beneath the amphiesma, as in 
Alexandrium  sp., or Scrippsiella  sp., and forms the wall of temporary cysts.
According to Dodge and Crawford (1970), the amphiesma construction falls into eight reason -
ably distinct categories (Figure 2.17): (1) simple membrane underlain by a single layer of vesicles 
600–800 nm in length, rather flattened, circular, or irregular in shape, with a gap of at least 40 nm 
between adjacent vesicles that may contain dense granular material; beneath the vesicles are parallel 
rows of microtubules which lie in groups of three; this simple arrangement is present in Oxyrrhis 
marina ; (2) simple membrane underlain by closely packed polygonal (generally hexagonal) vesicles 
0.8–1.2  μm in length, frequently containing fuzzy material; these vesicles and the cell membrane 
are occasionally perforated by trichocyst pores; beneath the vesicles lie microtubules in rows of 
variable number; this type of amphiesma is found in Amphidinium carterae ; (3) as in category (2), 
but with plug-like structures associated with the inner side of the vesicles; these plugs are cylindri -
cal structures 120-nm long and are arranged in single lines between single or paired microtubules; 
an example of this arrangement is present in Gymnodinium veneficum ; (4) as in category (2), but 
with thin (about 20 nm) plate-like structure in the flattened vesicles; this amphiesma character -
izes Aureodinium pigmentosum ; (5) in this group, the vesicles contain plates of medium thickness 
(60 nm), which slightly overlap; in Woloszynskia coronata , the plates are perforated by trichocyst 
pores; (6) the plates are thicker (up to 150 nm), reduced in number with a marked diversity of form; 
each plate has two or more sides bearing ridges and the remaining sides have tapered flanges; where 
FIGURE 2.16  Lorica of Pteromonas protracta .61 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthe plates join, one plate bears a ridge and the opposite bears a flange; Glenodinium foliaceum  
belongs to this category; (7) the plates can be up to 25- μm large and up to 1.8- μm thick; they bear 
a corrugated flange on two or more sides, and a thick rim with small projections on the opposing 
edges; these plates may overlap to a considerable extent and their surfaces may be covered by a 
pattern of reticulations; a distinctive member of this category is Ceratium  sp.; (8) amphiesma con -
sisting of two large plates, with one or more small plates in the vicinity of the flagellar pores at the 
anterior end of the cell; plates can be very thin and perforated by two or three simple trichocyst 
pores as in Prorocentrum nanum , or thick and with a very large number (up to 60) of trichocyst 
pores as in Prorocentrum micans .
The arrangement of thecal plates is termed tabulation and is of critical importance in taxonomy of 
dinoflagellates. Tabulation can also be conceived of as the arrangement of amphiesmal vesicles with 
or without thecal plates. The American planktologist and parasitologist Charles Kofoid developed a 
tabulation system allowing reference to the shape, size, and location of a particular plate; plates were 
recognized as being in series relative to particular landmarks such as the apex, cingulum (girdle), 
and sulcus. His formulae (i.e., the listing of the total number of plates in each series) were especially 
useful for most gonyaulacoid and peridinioid dinoflagellates. Apart from some minor changes intro -
duced afterwards, the Kofoid system is still the standard in the description of new taxa. Plates are 
numbered consecutively from that closest to the midventral position, continuing around to the cell 
left. A system of superscripts and other marks are used to designate the plate series. Two complete 
FIGURE 2.17  Diagram of the eight distinct category of the dinoflagellate amphiesma. See text for details.62 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCtransverse series of plates are present in the epitheca: apical ( ′), and precingular ( ′′), counted from 
the ventral side in a clockwise sequence. The hypotheca is also divided into two transverse series: 
postcingular ( ′′′) and antapical ( ′′′′). Some genera also possess an incomplete series of plates on the 
dorsal surface of the epitheca, termed anterior intercalary plates (a), and on the hypotheca, termed 
posterior intercalary plates (p). Cingular (C) and sulcal (S) plates are also identified (Figure 2.18). 
Thus, for example, the dinoflagellate Proteperidinium steinii  has a formula 4 ′, 3a, 7 ′′, 3C, 6S, 5 ′′′, 
2′′′′, which indicates four apical plates, three anterior intercalary plates, seven precingular plates, 
three cingular plates, six sulcal plates, five postcingular plates, and two antapical plates.
Type 4—Cell Surface with Additional Extracellular and Intracellular Material
Both the surface structure of Cryptophyceae (Cryptophyta) and Euglenophyceae (Euglenozoa) can 
be grouped under this type.
The main diagnostic feature of the members of the Cryptophyceae is their distinctive kind of cell 
surface, colloquially termed periplast. Examples are Chroomonas  (Figure 2.19) and Cryptomonas ; 
in these algae, the covering consists of outer and inner components, present on both sides of the 
membrane but variable in their composition. The inner component is comprised of protein and 
may consist of fibril material, a single sheet or multiple plates having various shapes, hexagonal, 
rectangular, oval, or round. The outer component may have plates, heptagonal scales, mucilage, 
or a combination of any of these. The pattern of these plates can be observed on the cell surface 
when viewed with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and freeze-fracture transmission electron 
microscope (TEM), but it is not easily detectable under light microscopy view.
Euglenophyceae possess an unusual membrane complex called pellicle, consisting of the plasma 
membrane overlying an electron-opaque semicontinuous proteic layer made up of overlapping strips.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThese strips or striae can be described as long ribbons usually arising in the flagellar pocket and 
extending from the cell apex to the posterior. Each strip is curved at both its edges, and in transverse 
section it shows a notch, an arched, or a slightly concave ridge, a convex groove and a heel region 
where adjacent strips interlock and articulate. The strips can be arranged helically or longitudinally; 
the first arrangement, very elastic, is present in the “plastic euglenoids” (e.g., Euglena , Peranema , 
Distigma ), either heterotrophic or phototrophic, where the strips are more than 16. Their relational 
sliding over one another along the articulation edges permit the cells to undergo “euglenoid move -
ment” or “metaboly.” This movement is a sort of peristaltic movement consisting of a cytoplasmic 
dilation forming at the front of the cell and passing to the rear. The return movement of the cyto -
plasm is brought about without dilation. The more rigid longitudinal arrangement is present in the 
“aplastic euglenoids” (e.g., Petalomonas , Pleotia , Entosiphon ), all heterotrophic, where the strips 
are usually less than 12. These euglenids are not capable of metaboly.
The ultrastructure of the pellicular complex shows three different structural levels (Figure 2.20):
• The plasma membrane with its mucilage coating (first level)
• An electron-opaque layer organized in ridges and grooves (second level)
• The microtubular system (third level)
First Level
A dense irregular layer of mucilaginous glycoproteins covers the external surface of the cell. It has a 
fuzzy texture that, however, has a somehow ordered structure of orientated threads. Mucilage bod -
ies present beneath the cell surface secrete the mucilaginous glycoproteins. The consolidation of the 
secretory products and their arrangement at one pole or round the periphery of the cell leads to the 
formation of peduncles (stalks of fixation) and other enveloping structures homologs to the loricas of 
Chrysophyceae and Chlorophyceae. Peduncles are present in Colacium , an euglenophyte that forms 
small arborescent colonies (Figure 2.21). Its cells, with reduced flagella, are attached by their anterior 
pole by a peduncle consisting of an axis of neutral polysaccharides and a cortex of acid polysaccha -
rides. Loricas are present in Trachelomonas  sp. (Figures 1.1bm and 2.22), Strombomonas verrucosa  
(Figure 2.23) and Ascoglena ; they are very rigid, made up of mucilaginous filaments impregnated 
with ferric hydroxide or manganese compounds which confer an orange, brown to black coloration to

ent structural levels of the pellicle. Arrows point to the first level (mucus coating); a square bracket localizes

collar that tapers to a more or less wide apical opening, where the flagella emerge, or possess a wide 
opening in one pole and attached to a substrate at the other pole, as in Ascoglena .
Beneath the mucus coating, there is the plasma membrane (Figure 2.24). This cell membrane is 
continuous and covers the ridges and grooves on the whole cell and can be considered the external 
surface of the cell. The protoplasmic face (PF) of the plasma membrane shows that the strips are 
covered with numerous peripheral membrane proteins of about 10 nm.

the protoplasmic fracture of the cell membrane. Scale bar, 0.10 μm. (Courtesy of Pietro Lupetti.)66 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCSecond Level
This peripheral cytoplasmic layer has a thickness that varies with the species. It consists of roughly 
twisted proteic fibers with a diameter from 10 to 15 nm arranged with an order texture or parallel 
striation (Figure 2.25a). The overall structure resembles the wired soul present in the tires, which 
gives the tire its resistance to tearing forces. Transversal fibers are detectable in some euglenoids, 
which connect the two longitudinal edges of the ridge of each strip (Figure 2.25b).
Third Level
There is a consistent number and arrangement of microtubules associated with each pellicular strip, 
which are continuous with those that line the flagellar canal and extend into the region of the reser -
voir. Within the ridge in the region of the notch, there are 3–5, usually 4, microtubules about 25-nm 
diameter running parallel along each strip. Two of these are always close together and are located 
immediately adjacent to the notch adhering to the membrane (Figure 2.20).
The lack of protein organization in the groove regions gives higher plasticity to these zones, and 
together with the presence of parallel microtubules in the ridge regions gives the characteristic pel -
lucular pattern to the surface of euglenoids.
The solid structure of the pellicle confers a very high degree of flexibility and resistance to the 
cells. Our experience with E. gracilis  allow us to say that this alga possesses one of the strongest 
covering present in these microorganisms. A pressure of more than 2000 psi (about 150 bar) is nec -
essary to break the pellicular structure of this alga.
Flagella  and associa Ted sTrUcTUres
Flagella can be defined as motile cylindrical appendages found in widely divergent cell types 
throughout the plant and animal kingdom, which either move the cell through its environment or 
move the environment relative to the cell.
Motile algal cells are typically biflagellate, although quadriflagellate types are commonly found 
in green algae; it is generally believed that the latter have been derived from the former, and a 
FIGURE 2.25  (a) Deep-etching image of Euglena gracilis  showing the second structural level of the pel -
licular complex, showing the regular texture of the internal face of the pellicle stripes. (b) TEM image of the 
pellicle of E. gracilis  in transverse section showing the transversal fibers connecting the edges of successive 
ridges. Scale bar, 0.10 μm.67 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCconvincing example of this derivation is Polytomella agilis  (Chlorophyceae) from Chlamydomonas  
sp. (Chlorophyceae). A triflagellate type of zoospore such as that of Acrochaete wittrockii  
(Ulvophyceae) may have originated from a quadriflagellate ancestor by reduction, whereas the few 
uniflagellate forms are most likely descendant of biflagellated cells. Intermediate cases exist which 
carry a short second flagellum, as in Mantoniella squamata  (Mamiellophyceae) or Euglena gracilis  
(Euglenophyceae), where one flagellum is reduced to a stub (Figure 2.26); in some species, one fla -
gellum of the pair is reduced to a nonfunctional basal body attached to the functional one, as in the 
uniflagellate swarmer of Dictyota dichotoma  (Phaeophyceae). A special case of multiflagellate alga 
is the naked zoospore of Oedogonium  (Chlorophyceae), where the numerous flagella form a ring or 
crown around the apical portion of the cell (stephanokont zoospore).
The characteristics of the flagella in a pair, that is, relative length and surface features, have 
led to a specific nomenclature. When the two flagella differ in length and surface features, one 
being hairy and the other smooth, they are termed “heterokont.” This term applies to all the 
members of the Ochrophyta. When the two flagella are equal in length and appearance, the 
term “isokont” is used (Figure 2.27), which applies to Haptophyta and to Chlorophyceae and 
Charopyceae. Within this group, there are few genera whose flagella differ in length, which are 
termed “anisokont.”

tory emerging flagellum bearing the photoreceptor and the nonemerging flagellum reduced to a stub. Scale

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCDescription of flagella anatomy will proceed from the outside to the inside, from the surface 
features and components to the axoneme and additional inclusions, to the structures anchoring the 
flagella to the cell.
Flagellar Shape and Surface Features
Deviations from the cylindrical shape are rare among the algae. Usually the flagellar membrane 
fits smoothly around the axoneme and a total diameter of 0.25–0.35 μm, excluding scales, hairs, 
etc, holds for most species. If extra material is present between the axoneme and the flagellar mem -
brane, the flagellum diameter increases either locally as in the case of flagellar swellings, or through 
almost the entire length as in the case of paraxial rods. Minor deviations from the cylindrical shape 
are caused by small extensions of the membrane to form one or more longitudinal keels running 
the length of the flagellum. Greater extension of the membrane forms a ribbon or wing supported 
along the edge by a paraxial rod. More variations are present in the flagellar tip, since flagella can 
possess a hairpoint, that is, their distal part is thinner with respect to the rest of the flagellum, or be 
blunt-tipped, with an abundance of intermediates between these two types.
Flagellar surface is smooth in many algae, where only a simple plasma membrane envelopes 
the axoneme. Sometimes, however, a distinct, apparently homogeneous dense layer covers the 
flagellar membrane throughout (Figure 2.28). One of the two flagella of Ochrophyta is smooth; 
smooth flagella are present also in members of the Haptophyta, such as Chrysochromulina 
parva  (Coccolithophyceae), and in many Chlorophyta, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  
(Chlorophyceae).
Flagellar Scales
Flagella may bear a high variety of coverings and ornamentation, which often represents a taxo -
nomic feature. The occurrence of flagellar scale follows that of cell body scales, since they are 
present only in eukaryotic algae, in the divisions of Ochrophyta, Haptophyta, and Chlorophyta. As 
for the cell body scales, they have a silica-based composition in the Ochrophyta, a mixed structure 
of calcium carbonate and organic matter in the Haptophyta, and a completely organic nature in the 
Chlorophyta.
Members of the Ochrophyta fall into two groups: one possessing exactly the same type of 
scale on both flagellar and body surface, while the other showing flagellar scales different in 
structure and arrangement from body scales. Example of the first group is Sphaleromantis  sp. 
FIGURE 2.28  TEM image of a Tetraflagellochloris mauritamca  flagellum in transverse section, showing 
the homogeneous fuzzy coating of its membrane. Scale bar, 0.10 μm.69 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC(Chrysophyceae), whose flagella and cell body are closely packed with scales of very peculiar 
appearance, resembling the branched structure of a tree. Examples of the second group are 
Mallomonas  sp. and Synura  sp. (Synurophyceae); in both genera, flagellar scales are not arranged 
in a regular pattern, are very small (under 300 nm), and possess different morphological types, 
the most characteristic being the annular type. As the body scales, flagellar scales are produced 
in deposition vesicles, extruded from the cell and brought into correct position in relation to the 
other scales and the cell surface.
As said above, flagella of the Haptophyta are usually equal in length and appearance (iso -
kont); however, members of the genus Pavlova  (Pavlovophyceae) possess two markedly unequal 
flagella, the anterior one is much longer than the posterior, and carrying small, dense scales in 
the form of spherical or clavate knobs. These scales are often arranged in regular rows longi -
tudinally, or can be randomly disposed on the flagellum. Scales are formed inside the Golgi 
apparatus and then released into the cell surface by fusion of the plasmalemma and the cisternal 
membrane.
Flagellar scales are known from many Chlorophyta, such as Prasinophytes, Chlorodendrophyceae, 
Nephroselmidophyceae, and Mamiellophyceae. These algae possess nonmineralized organic scales 
on their cell body and flagella, the same type of scale being rarely present on both surfaces. On the 
flagella, the scales are precisely arranged in parallel longitudinal rows, sometimes in one layer, two 
layers, or even three layers on top of each other. Each layer usually contains only one type of scales. 
The four flagella of Tetraselmis  sp. (Chlorodendrophyceae) are covered by different types of scales: 
pentagonal scales attached to the flagellar membrane (Figure 2.29), rod-shaped scales covering 
the pentagonal scales, and hair scales organized in two rows on opposite side of the flagellum. A 
fourth type termed “knotted scales” is present only in some strains, but their precise arrangement 
is not known. In Nephroselmis spinosa  (Nephroselmidophyceae), the flagellar surface is coated by 
two different types of scales arranged in two distinct layers. Scales of the inner layer, deposited 
directly on the membrane, are small and square, 40 nm across (Figure 2.30); scales of the outer 
layer are rod-shaped, 30–40-nm long, and are deposited atop the inner scales. As in Tetraselmis , 
hair scales of at least two different types are also present covering the flagella. In Pyramimonas  sp. 
(Prasinophytes), the scales are extremely complex in structure and ornamentation, and belong to 
three different types. Minute pentagonal scales, 40-nm wide, form the layer covering the membrane, 
which in turn is covered by limuloid scales, 313-nm long and 190-nm wide, arranged in nine rows 
(Figure 2.31); each flagellum also bears two rows of almost opposite tubular hair scales, 1.3 μm 
long. Spider web scales with an ellipsoid outline are present in Mamiella gilva  (Mamiellophyceae), 
which are ornamented by a radial spoke elongated into a conspicuous spine (Figure 2.32).

membrane of Tetraselmis  sp.

brane of Nephroselmis spinosa .70 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThe scales are synthesized within the Golgi vesicles. The vesicles then migrate to the base of the 
flagella and from here are extruded and arranged on the flagella.
Flagellar Hairs
Flagellar hairs can be grouped into two types: tubular and nontubular (simple) hairs.
Tubular hairs consist of two or more distinct regions, at least one of which is thick and tubular, 
while the distal elements may be simpler. This type of hairs is further divided into cryptophycean 
hairs, tripartite hairs, and prasinophycean hairs.
The cryptophycean hairs are unique for arrangement to the Cryptophyceae (Cryptophyta), being 
attached in two opposite rows on the longer flagellum, and on a single row on the shorter one. On 
the long flagellum, the hairs consist of a tubular proximal part, 1.5–2.5- μm long, and a nontubular 
distal filament, 1 μm long, while the hairs on the shorter flagellum are shorter, 1–1.5- μm long, with 
a distal filament 1- μm long.
Tripartite hairs are the hair type of the Ochrophyta (Figure 2.33a and 2.33b). These hairs consist 
of three morphological regions, that is, a short basal region, a tubular hollow shaft, and a distal 
region. The basal part is 0.2–0.3- μm long and tapers towards the site of attachment to the flagellar 
membrane, at which point dense structures are present that connect the hairs to the peripheral axo -
neme microtubules. The hollow shaft shows a range of length from 0.7–0.8 to 2 μm and a diameter 
FIGURE 2.31  Limuloid scale of the flagellar mem -

transverse sections, showing the tripartite hairs. Scale bar, 0.25 μm.71 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCof about 16 nm. The distal parts of each hair, called terminal filaments or fibers, are extremely frag -
ile, hence difficult to detect because readily shed during electron microscopy preparation. In some 
cases, they are organized in a 2 + 1 structure, that is, two short filaments 0.3- μm long and one long 
filament 1- μm long; however, differences exist in their number, length, and diameter.
Cells of the Prasinophytes carry hairs on all their flagella, whether one, two, four, or eight, 
which are very diverse in morphology. They can vary in length from 0.5 to 3 μm, and a single 
flagellum may carry more than one hair type. In Pyramimonas orientalis , both lateral and api -
cal hairs are bipartite and of the same length, with the lateral hairs being divided into a short, 
thick base, of 160 nm, and a long, thin distal part, of 650 nm, and the apical hairs possessing a 
long thick base and a very short, thin tip. Another example of flagellar hairs is Mantoniella  sp. 
(Mamiellophyceae), bearing hairs on the flagellar tip which are longer than those on the side. In 
Nephroselmis  (Nephroselmidophyceae) and Tetraselmis  (Chlorodendrophyceae), there is a single 
hair type divided into two regions of roughly the same length (0.5 μm).
Unlike tubular hairs, simple, nontubular hairs are not differentiated into regions; they are thin, 
and very delicate, probably consisting of a single row of subunits. These hairs occur in a variety 
of groups, but are unique in the Euglenophyceae and Dinophyceae, whose hairy coverings share 
certain features not known to occur in any other algal group.
In Euglenophyceae, long, simple hairs are arranged in a single row on the emergent part of the 
flagella. In general, with two emergent flagella, the hair covering is similar on the two flagella. 
In Euglena gracilis , these long hairs consist of a single filament 3–4- μm long, with a diameter of 
10 nm, while in Eutreptiella gymnastica , they are 4–5- μm long and assembled in unilateral bun -
dles. In addition to these long hairs, euglenoid flagella carry a dense felt of shorter hairs, which 
in Euglena  are approximately half as long and half as thick as the long hairs. These short hairs, 
precisely positioned with respect to each other and to axonemal components, consist of a sheath 
about 240–300 nm in length, which represents the basic unit. The units, each formed by loops, 
side arms, and filaments lie parallel to each other in the longitudinal direction of the flagellum 
(Figure 2.34); two groups of short hairs are arranged helically on each narrow side of the flagel -
lum, separated by each other by two membrane areas without hair attachments. In Dinophyceae, 
both the longitudinal and the transverse flagellum carry hairs, but unlike Euglenophyceae, the 
hairy coverings on the two flagella are different. The transverse flagellum carries unilateral hairs 
except in the proximal part; they are 2–4- μm long and arranged in bundles, each bundle con -
sisting of differently sized hairs. In Oxyrrhis marina , hairs are of three different lengths, the 
FIGURE 2.34 Short hairs of Euglena  flagellum.72 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLClongest in the middle. Hairs on the longitudinal flagellum are shorter than those on the transverse 
flagellum (0.4–0.75  μm), but similar in diameter (10 nm).
Simple, nontubular hairs are present also in some Glaucophyta and Chlorophyta.
Flagellar Spines
Flagellar spines are a peculiarity of unknown function confined to male gametes of a few ooga -
mous brown algae. The spermatozoids of Dictyota  sp. (Phaeophyceae) are unique in possessing 
a longitudinal row of 12 very short spines on their single hairy flagella (these spermatozoids are 
basically biflagellate, but the second flagellum is reduced to its basal body only). Spines are absent 
on the distal 2.5–3 μm of the flagellum, and on the proximal 10 μm. In other Phaeophyceae such as 
Himanthalia , Xiphophora , and Hormosira , spermatozoids possess only a single spine, up to 1.0- μm 
long. In all these algae, each spine is made up of electron-dense material, located between the flagel -
lar membrane and the peripheral axonemal doublets.
inTernal  FeaTUres oF The Flagell Um
Axoneme
The movements of the flagella are generated by a single functional unit, the axoneme, which con -
sists of a long cylinder, from 10- to 100- μm long, 0.2- μm in diameter. Its structure, as seen in 
cross-sections by electron microscopy, is almost ubiquitous: it is made of nine equally spaced 
outer microtubule doublets (A and B) approximately 40 nm in diameter surrounding two central 
microtubules, the central pair (Figure 2.28). This arrangement is maintained by a delicate series 
of linkages to give the classical 9 + 2 pattern. The nine outer doublets are numbered starting from 
number 1 located in the plane orthogonal to the plane including the central pair, and counting 
clockwise when looking from the tip of the flagellum. The former plane allows the definition of 
the curvature directions during beating as left or right relatively to it. Doublets are transiently 
linked by outer/inner dynein arms (ODA and IDA) that represent the flagellar motor and perma -
nently interconnected by nexin links; the radial spokes connect the central pair to the peripheral 
microtubules of the outer doublets. Divergence from the basic 9 + 2 pattern is rare, but include the 
spermatozoid of some centric diatoms (9 + 0) and the chlorophyta Golenkinia minutissima  (9 + 1), 
as well as the haptonema of the Prymnesiophyceae (Figure 2.35). This structure develops between 
the two flagella of these algae, and it is sometimes longer than the flagella themselves. It resembles 
a flagellum, but contains a central shaft of 6–8 microtubules arranged in a cylinder, with no dou -
blets. In transverse section, the microtubules are disposed in an arc of a circle or in a ring and are 
surrounded by a limb of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The distal part of the haptonema is 
fairly straightforward. It is surrounded by the plasma membrane, which is continuous over the tip 
of the haptonema and may be smooth, drawn into a tip, or form a spathulate projection.
The bulk of axonemal proteins (70%) is made of tubulins, the building blocks (heterodimers) 
that polymerize linearly to form microtubules. Those tubulins, which constitute the wall of microtu -
bules, belong to the a and b families, whose sequences have been conserved during evolution (other 
families, g, d, e, are responsible for microtubule nucleation at the level of the basal bodies/centro -
somes). A large molecular diversity among tubulins is generated by a series of post-translational 
modifications such as acetylation, detyrosylation, polyglutamylation, or polyglycylation. Tektin fila -
ments are present at the junction between the A and B microtubules of each doublet. The internal 
and external arms that graft to the peripheral doublets represent 10–15% of the global protein mass 
of axonemes and are essentially formed by the “dynein-ATPases” motor (the Greek word “dyne” 
means force). Microtubular dyneins are large multimolecular complexes with a pseudo-bouquet 
shape and a molecular mass ranging from 1.4 MDa (bouquets with two heads) to 1.9 MDa (bou -
quets with three heads) for the whole molecule, and approximately 500 kDa for the largest subunits 
containing the ATP hydrolysis site. The size of both ODA and IDA is approximately 50 nm. Among 73 Anatomy

sis, only a few have been associated with a function.
Paraxial Rod
In addition to the 9 + 2 axoneme, algal flagella may contain a number of other structures within the 
flagellar membrane. Among those extending through the entire length of the flagella, there is the 
paraxial rod, which is known only in the order of Pedinellales (Dictyochophyceae, Ochrophyta), 
and in members of the Euglenophyceae and Dinophyceae. Paraxial rod is also termed paraflagellar 
rod (PFR). PFRs are complex and highly organized lattice-like structures that run parallel to the 
axoneme. Among the different groups, PFRs are structurally and biochemically similar.
In the Pedinellales, the membrane of the single emergent flagellum is expanded into a sheath or 
fin supported along the edge by the rod, which is cross-banded. Thanks to the presence of the fin, 
these algae are excellent swimmers. Their axoneme beats in a distinct planar wave.
Paraflagellar structures of characteristic appearance are present in some dinoflagellates. A hol -
low cylinder with the wall composed of helically arranged filaments is present in the single emergent 
(longitudinal) flagellum of Noctiluca  gametes and in the longitudinal flagellum of both Gyrodinium 
lebouriae  and Oxyrrhis marina . This rod is about as big as the axoneme in diameter and runs along 
the axoneme to which it is attached for almost its entire length. The thin filaments (nanofilaments 
with a 2–4-nm diameter) of its highly geometrically organized network are periodically attached to 
some of the outer doublet microtubules of the axoneme, which in O. marina  is doublet number 4. 
A different type of paraxial rod is present in the complex-shaped transverse flagellum of dinoflagel -
lates. This rod takes a nearly straight path along the inner wall of the sulcus and is regularly banded 
in the transverse direction. In contrast, the axoneme itself is distinctly helical.
A rod is present in most members of Euglenophyceae. In genera with two emergent flagella, 
such as Eutreptia  and Eutreptiella , both flagella carry a paraxial rod. In Eutreptiella , where the 
FIGURE 2.35  Schematic drawing of the generalized representation of the structure of the haptonema of 
Chrysochromulina .74 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCtwo flagella differ in length, the rods also differ from each other in thickness and fine structure, the 
longer flagellum carrying a more complex rod than the shorter flagellum. In genera with a flagellar 
apparatus reduced to one long emergent flagellum and one short flagellum not extending beyond 
the reservoir region, only the emergent flagellum retains the rod, which extends its entire length. 
An example is Euglena gracilis ; in this alga, the rod arises just above the flagellar transition zone 
and is located lateroventrally with respect to the axoneme and the cell body. In thin cross-sections 
of isolated and demembranated flagella, the rod appears hollow with an outer diameter of 90 nm. 
Images obtained from negative staining preparations show that the rod is made up of several coiled 
filaments, with a diameter of 22 nm, forming a 7-start left-handed helix with a pitch of 45° and a 
periodicity of 54 nm. Extending from the surface of the rod a series of goblet-like projections can 
be observed, which form the point of attachment between the rod and one of the axonemal doublet 
microtubules (Figure 2.36a and b). The PFR does not assume any consistent orientation with respect 
to the central-pair microtubules of the emergent flagellum.
Two major protein components of the PFR have been identified in euglenoids and dinoflagel -
lates with a number of possible minor protein constituents. These major proteins (PFR1 and PFR2) 
migrate in the SDS–PAGE as a doublet of similar abundance. Depending on the organism, the 
mobility for PFR1 ranges from 70 to 80 kDa, and for PFR2 from 62 to 70 kDa. Coiled-coils are 
a common structural motif in the filament formed using the PFR1 and PFR2 proteins. Database 
searches reveal a 41-residue conserved region of the PFR1/PFR2 family that bears a significant rela -
tionship to a conserved motif within the central coiled-coil rod of tropomyosin.
Other Intraflagellar Accessory Structures
Other intraflagellar accessory structures are present in dinoflagellates besides the PFR, the  so-called 
R fiber (Rf) and the so-called striated fiber (Sf). These structures do not show any kind of lattice or 
precisely organized structure. However, they deserve mentioning since they run for long distances 
along the axonemal structure and therefore are also candidates for modulating the axonemal beat -
ing, possibly by Ca2+-dependent contraction or through dipole–dipole forces.

Arrows point to the PFR. (b) Schematic drawing of the PFR showing the coiled filaments and goblet-like 
projections. Scale bar, 0.40 μm.75 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThe Rf is made of thin filaments 2–4 nm in diameter. It may be as large as the axoneme or the PFR 
in diameter (300–500 nm), runs along the major part of the axoneme, and is attached to it via the PFR, 
the PFR linking the Rf to the axoneme. The Rf may contract and shows transversal striations of vari -
able periodicities and thickness only during its contraction, but not in its relaxed or fully contracted 
state (Figure 2.37). The precise structure of the Rf varies according to the fixation conditions for 
TEM, mostly depending on the Ca2+ concentration, suggesting that its contractility is Ca2+-dependent. 
In some dinoflagellates such as Ceratium furca , the Rf is a good candidate for the induction of the 
complete retraction of the longitudinal flagellum in the flagellar pocket, a movement that cannot be 
explained by the axoneme structure itself. In this retracted state, the Rf is contracted and the axoneme 
is highly folded (more tightly that during the usual flagellar beating). Therefore, the Rf could modulate 
the properties of the PFR and axoneme motility through constraints imposed to the PFR.
The so-called Sf is also made of thin filaments. It is much smaller than the PFR or the axoneme 
in diameter (about 35 nm) and runs along three-fourths of the axoneme. Its transversal striations 
suggest its implication in contractile processes that could modulate axonemal motility through 
gradual changes in the axonemal wavelength and/or amplitude.
Transition Zone
Although both the flagellar axoneme and the basal body that continues it are very constant in mor -
phology among the different algae, the transition region where they meet varies considerably and is 
considered one of the most useful indicators of phylogenetic relationships. This region sometimes 
contains particular structures such as helices, star-shaped bodies, and transverse partitions referred 
to as basal plates. Five main types of transition zones may be distinguished, taking into account that 
secondary variations can appear within each zone.
Type 1 (Figure 2.38) appears the simplest, with only one basal plate situated at the level of the 
point of inflexion of the flagellar membrane. Immediately above it, the flagellum shows a slight 
FIGURE 2.37  Schematic drawing of longitudinal flagellum of Ceratium furca  during its contraction show -
ing the striated Rf.76 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCnarrowing. Radial fibers connect the peripheral doublets with submembrane swellings. This type of 
transition zone is present in the Phaeophyceae (Ochrophyta).
In Type 2 (Figure 2.39), the basal plate is replaced by a sort of plug located beneath the point of 
inflexion of the flagellar membrane, far from the point of origin of the central pair of doublets. In 
this transition zone, the nine outer doublets show a strong dilatation, which leaves room for a fibril -
lar spiral suspended on the doublets by short spokes. The spiral can reach the central doublet or be 
much shorter. Each outer doublet is associated via other spokes with a thickening of the membrane, 
whose folding forms a star with nine characteristic arms (Figure 2.40a and b). This transition region 
FIGURE 2.38 Type 1 transition zone (Phaeophyceae, Ochrophyta).
FIGURE 2.39  Type 2 transition zone (Euglenophyceae).77 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCis typical of the Euglenophyceae. Among these algae, Entosiphon sulcatum  is unique for its long 
transition region, the spiral of which surrounds the proximal 1 μm of the central doublet.
Type 3 transition regions possess a double system of complex plates. Variations exist due to the 
distance separating the plates or due to the presence of interposition material between them. In the 
Dinophyceae, the basal plate is duplicated and ring-shaped; above it, there are two median discs, the 
uppermost supporting the central doublet of the axoneme (Figure 2.41a). In the Cryptophyta, an apical 
plate is located at the level of the narrowing of the flagellum above the point of inflexion of the flagellar 
membrane; the central doublet is right above this plate. A second plate bearing a ring-shaped thicken -
ing is located beneath it. In Cyanophora  (Glaucophyceae, Glaucophyta), the apical plate has the same 
localization present in Cryptophyta, but it is ring-shaped and traversed by the central doublet that 
continues toward the basal plate situated at the level of the point of inflexion of the flagellar membrane 
(Figure 2.41b). Further variations of this type are present in Haptophyta, where two widely spaced

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCplates are present, the apical below the central doublet. Each plate corresponds to a flagellar constric -
tion, and the space between them possibly contains fibrillar material; in cross-section, a stellate struc -
ture is visible, the arm of which connect with the A-Tubules of the peripheral doublets (Figure 2.41c).
In Type 4 (Figure 2.42), there is only one basal plate situated at the point where the flagellum 
emerges, but this type of transition region is characterized by a very peculiar structure called “tran -
sitional helix.” In longitudinal sections, this appears as a double row of punctae equidistant from 
the doublets, representing the four to six turns of a helix (Figure 2.43a and b). Some variations 
occur in the number of gyres, which in a short flagellum may be as low as 1. This helix is present in 
Chrysophyceae, Xanthophyceae, and Eustigmatophyceae (Ochrophyta).
Type 5 (Figure 2.44) is characterized by the so-called “stellate pattern”; typically, it is divided 
into a longer distal and a shorter proximal part, separated by a basal plate. In longitudinal section, 
the structure resembles an H, with the cross-bar located at a short distance above the cell surface 
(Figure 2.46a). Transversely, the cross-bar may or may not extend to the peripheral doublets of the 
axoneme. Variations regard the length of the proximal part, the location of the plate, and the appear -
ance of additional rings. This transition zone is typical of Chlorophyta.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCBasal Bodies
A flagellum cannot be dissociated from its base, the basal body, or kinetosome. This structure has 
a cylindrical form, with an average diameter of 0.2 μm and a variable height (average 0.5 μm). The 
wall of the cylinder is discontinuous, consists of nine microtubular triplets tilted to the radii at an 
angle of 130°, and interconnected by transverse desmosomes. The complete tubule A consists of 
13 protofilaments, and the incomplete tubules B and C have 10 protofilaments. The proximal part 
of the basal body contains a fibrogranular structure termed the cartwheel, composed of a longi -
tudinal central tubule and nine series of spokes joined to the triplets. This structure seems to be 
present in nearly all species of algae, with variations reported mainly for the length of the basal 
body. While most green algae usually possess very short basal bodies (250–450 nm), those of the 
Prasinophytes are often twice as long (560–690 nm). Some members of the Haptophyta, such as 
Chrysochromulina  (Coccolithophyceae), also possess very long basal bodies (850–875 nm), but this 
length can reach a value of 1300 nm in some Euglenophyceae such as Entosiphon .
In some Chlorophyta, two structures are present in association with the proximal ends of the basal 
bodies: the terminal cap and the proximal sheaths. The terminal cap is a more or less prominent 
electron-dense flap located at the anterior surface of the basal body, which folds over and covers in 
part its proximal end. The proximal sheath is located posterior to the proximal end of the basal body, 
can have a half-cylindrical shape or be wedge-shaped, narrow proximally, and broadening distally.
Variations in the number of basal bodies mainly reflect variations in the number of flagella. It is 
possible to distinguish:
 1. Cells with only one basal body, carrying one flagellum; this situation is very rare and is 
present in the euglenophyte of uncertain affinity Scytomonas pusilla , and in the gametes 
of the diatoms Lithodesmium  and Biddulphia .
 2. Cells with two neighboring basal bodies, forming the so-called primordial pair, and indi -
cated as 2A.
 3. Cells with numerous basal bodies.
In the case of two basal bodies, two possibilities exist: only one basal body, generally situ -
ated close to the nucleus or linked to it, possesses a flagellum, as in the spores of Hydrurus  
(Chrysophyceae), or both basal bodies possess a flagellum. The latter is the most frequently occur -
ring situation in flagellate algae. Most often the basal bodies are inclined towards each other; some -
times, they are perpendicular, or they may also be parallel facing the same directions or antiparallel 
FIGURE 2.44  Type 5 transition zone (Chlorophyta).80 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCfacing opposite directions. In the Glaucophyta, the two basal bodies are inclined toward each 
other; in the Heterokontophyta, they are parallel in the Chrysophyceae Mallomonas  and Synura,  
almost perpendicular in Ochromonas , lie at an obtuse angle to each other in the Xanthophyceae and 
Phaeophyceae, are inclined to each other at an angle of about 90° in the Eustigmatophyceae and 
Raphidophyceae; in the Haptophyta, the angle between the two basal bodies can be acute or obtuse; 
in both Cryptophyceae and Euglenophyceae, the basal bodies are almost parallel, while in the 
Dinophyceae they lie at almost 180° to each other and slightly overlap. In the Chlorophyta, the angle 
between the two basal bodies can vary (about 90° in Chlamydomonas  and 180° in Acrosiphonia  
zoid), and the couple can assume three different configurations:
 1. 11 o’clock–5 o’clock configuration, in which the basal bodies are rotated anticlockwise 
relative to the ancestral configuration (Figure 2.45a).
 2. 12 o’clock–6 o’clock ancestral configuration, in which the basal bodies are in line with 
each other (Figure 2.45b).
 3. 1 o’clock–7 o’clock, in which the basal bodies are rotated clockwise relative to the ancestral 
configuration (Figure 2.45c).
The 11 o’clock–5 o’clock configuration is present in Ulvophyceae and Dasycladophyceae, while 
both the 12 o’clock–6 o’clock and 1 o’clock–7 o’clock configurations are present in the Chlorophyceae.
In the case of many basal bodies, the increase in their number and the corresponding increase in 
the number of flagella can result from
 1. A replica of each basal body of the pair, as in the stephanokont zoospore of Oedogonium  
(Chlorophyceae).
 2. Replica of the primordial pair, indicated by the formula X ⋅ 2A, as in the dinoflagellate 
Phaeopolykrikos  sp. (Dinophyceae), where the primordial pair has undergone four replicas 
(4 ⋅ 2A).
 3. Addition of new basal bodies in the surroundings of the primordial pair without there 
have been a replication of it, indicated by the formula 2A + N; algae with four flagella, 
as Tetraselmis suecica  (Chlorodendrophyceae) or Pyramimonas lunata  (Prasinophytes), 
have a formula 2A + 2N, while algae with eight flagella such as Pyramimonas octopus  
(Prasinophytes) are indicated by the formula 2A + 6N.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCFigure 2.46a shows an example of flagellum assemblage, relative to the longitudinal section of 
a flagellum of Tetraflagellochloris mauritanica  (Chlorophyceae), in the region between the basal 
bodies and the 9 + 2 axonemal structure. The basal bodies are composed of nine tilted microtu -
bular triplets with connections between the A- and C-tubules of adjacent triplets. At the proximal 
end of each basal body, the hub-and-spoke complex of the cartwheel is present (Figure 2.46b). This 
structure consists of a central hub with a central dot, and nine spokes that are connected to the A 
tubules by nine electron-dense knobs (Figure 2.46b). In the median longitudinal section, a series 
of projections seem to extend into the lumen of the basal body along the microtubular triplets, 
distally to the cartwheel. The lumen of the basal body is filled with filaments (asterisks, Figure 
2.46a and c).
Distal to the end of the C-microtubules of the basal body is the transition zone (tz), which is 
characteristic of green algae (square brackets, Figure 2.46a).
This region contains two distinct stellate structures that are separated by the transitional plate. 
The stellate structure is formed by filaments that connect the A tubules of every third axonemal 
doublet with each other, constituting (as seen in transverse sections) a nine-pointed star with a 
central ring-like hub (Figure 2.46d). In longitudinal sections, the two stellate structures form an 
H-piece with uneven arms composed of the distal (~800-nm long) and proximal (~320-nm long) 
stellate structures and separated by the transitional plate (Figure 2.46a). Different from other chlo -
rophycean algae such as Chlamydomonas , both the distal and the proximal stellate structures are 
attached to the same transitional plate, which in our preparation does not seem to extend to the 
microtubule doublets. Figure 2.46d shows a cross-section through the proximal stellate structure 
of the transitional region; projections attached to the A–B tubule junction extend to the flagellum 
membrane. Figure 2.46e shows the internal 9 + 2 structure of the axoneme.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCRoot System
All algal flagella appear to possess flagellar roots, that is, microtubular or fibrillar, often cross-
banded structures, which extend from the basal bodies into the cytoplasm either underlying the 
plasma membrane or projecting into the cell and making contact with other organelles such as the 
nucleus, the mitochondria, the Golgi apparatus, or the chloroplasts. Diverse functions have been 
assigned to the flagellar roots: anchoring devices and/or stress absorbers; sensory transducers, skel -
etal, and organizational structures for morphogenetic processes.
The great diversity of morphology and arrangement of the flagellar root systems among the 
different algae make it necessary to describe them separately in each division. As said above, 
Cyanobacteria and Rhodophyta lack any flagellar apparatus, hence they will not be considered in 
the following.
Glaucophyta
In the cyanelle-containing genera Gloeochaete  and Glaucocystis , four roots are arranged in a 
cruciate manner, that is, four roots spreading out more or less evenly from the basal bodies. All 
the four roots appear identical, each containing about 20 microtubules in Glaucocystis , and about 
50 in Gloeochaete . In Cyanophora , the roots are two. In all the genera, each root contains a mul -
tilayered structure consisting of a band of microtubules which overlies several layers of parallel 
plates (Figure 2.47).
Chlorophyta—Charophyta
Flagellar apparatus of most green algae are characterized by a cruciate root system. A cruciate root 
system consists of four roots spreading out more or less evenly from the basal bodies and with oppo -
site roots usually possessing identical numbers of microtubules. Since in most members of these two 
phyla, two of the roots are two-stranded, the general arrangement of microtubular root follows the 
X–2–X–2 system, with X varying from 3 to 8 microtubules.
The root system is cruciate with a 4–2–4–2 system in the tetraflagellate Pyramimonas  
(Prasinophytes) and Tetraselmis  (Chlorodendrophyceae), a 4–2–0–0 system in Mantoniella 
FIGURE 2.47  Root system of Glaucophyta. AF: anterior flagellum; PF: posterior flagellum; MLS: multilay -
ered structure.83 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCsquamata  (Mamiellophyceae), due to the reduction in one of the two flagella, and due to its lack of 
roots, a 4–3–0–(7–12) system in Nephroselmis  (Nephroselmidophyceae), and a 4–6–4–6 system in 
Mesostigma  (Mesostigmatophyceae). When four microtubular roots are present, as in Pyramimonas , 
they extend up to the sides of the flagellar pit toward the anterior of the cell, where they join the 
microtubules of the cytoskeleton, which radiate from the flagellar region below the membrane. An 
elaborate system of nonstriated fibers connects the basal bodies, which are associated with one or 
more rhizoplasts. These contractile structures extend from the proximal ends of the basal bodies 
down to the chloroplast, where they branch over the chloroplast surface and get in contact with it. 
Some tetraflagellate members of this class possess a synistosome, a fibrous band longitudinally 
striated connecting two of the basal bodies, and an asymmetrical structure termed lateral fibrous 
band, which forms an arc on one side of the four basal bodies. Proximal connective fibers may be 
present between the basal bodies. The microtubular root system of flagellate Chlorophyceae has the 
X–2–X–2 pattern except in the stephanokont reproductive cells of Oedogoniales. The roots diverge 
from the basal bodies and run beneath the cell membrane toward the posterior of the cell. Fibrous 
roots are generally present and associated with the 2-membered microtubular roots. Rhizoplasts 
extend from the basal bodies to the nucleus. The basal bodies are connected by a robust upper stri -
ated connective and two lower striated connectives (Figure 2.48).
In the stephanokont zoospore of Oedogonium  sp., the flagellar bases are connected by a 
 transversely striated fibrous band running around the top of the zoospore above the flagella. Three-
membered microtubular roots perpendicular to the basal bodies depart from them and extend 
towards the posterior of the cell. Other striated components are present in close association with the 
microtubular roots.
The unusual root system of recently identified chlorophycean T. mauritanica  deserves a more 
detailed description. The four basal bodies are arranged as two pairs in a nearly diamond shape; 
the two opposite basal bodies, numbers 1 and 2, are closer to each other than the other two, 
which are located on the sides of the first pair and do not touch (Figure 2.49). A complex system 
of striated roots and radiating microtubules occurs around the four basal bodies, anchoring the 
FIGURE 2.48  Root system of Chlorophyceae (Chlorophyta). 2SR, two-stranded roots; R4, four-stranded

prominent than the other, originates at each of the two closer basal bodies (Figure 2.50a, white 
asterisk and white arrowhead, respectively). Smaller striated roots originate at the second pair 
of basal bodies (Figure 2.50b, arrowhead). In transverse and longitudinal sections, these striated 
roots reveal a periodicity of 300–330 nm (Figure 2.50c, asterisk) and a clear distal tapering where 
they underlie the plasmalemma (Figure 2.50c). Microtubular roots are also present: two-stranded 
microtubular roots (Figure 2.50e, arrows) and four-over-one roots (Figure 2.50f, arrow). The stri -
ated roots are closely associated with the microtubular roots (Figure 2.50c and d, arrow). In TEM 
and SEM images (Figure 2.51a and b), the tapered ends of the striated roots form two symmetrical 
shoulders in the posterior part of the cell, just below the flagellar emergence; the microtubular 
roots curve above the shoulders and down the sides of the cell for some distance. Basal bodies no. 
1 and no. 2 lie in a V configuration (Figures 2.49 and 2.51c), while those of the other pair lie paral -
lel to each other (Figures 2.49 and 2.51d). In the V configuration, the basal bodies are joined by a 
striated distal connection (Figure 2.51c, arrow) that is positioned immediately below the flagellar 
transition zone. The two basal bodies are joined at their bottom also by a basal plate (Figure 2.51c, 
double arrowheads). The basal bodies of the other flagellar pair show a similar connection system; 
a prominent proximal connection showing alternating electron-dense zones resembling a striation 
(Figure 2.51d, asterisk) and a basal plate (Figure 2.51c, arrowheads). The arrow in Figure 2.51d 
indicates the cross-sectioned connecting fiber that joins flagella no. 1 and no. 2. Immediately below 
the connecting fiber, the microtubular roots are visible (double asterisks).
The microtubular rootlets of the flagellate reproductive cells of Ulvophyceae follow the X–2–X–2 
arrangement of most green algae, with X = 4 in Ulva  and Enteromorpha , and X = 5 in Ulothrix . 
Striated bands connect the rootlets to the basal bodies, which are connected anteriorly by an upper 
connective; in some genera, additional striated bands between the basal bodies and striated com -
ponent associated with the 2-membered root can be detected. In Chaetomorpha , X is 3, while in 
Cladophora  X is 4. The microtubular rootlet systems of the biflagellate cells extends posteriorly 
nearly parallel to one another and to the basal body from which they arise. In the X-membered root -
lets, an electron-dense strut or wing connects one of the uppermost microtubules to the subtending 
singlet, and the entire rootlet is usually subtended by a massive, more or less striated structure. The 
2-membered rootlets may also be accompanied by such structures. An upper transversely striated 
connective links the basal bodies.

Transversely striated bands connecting the rootlets to the basal bodies are also present. Species 
exist in this class, which produce stephanokont zoospores with more than 30 flagella. In these cells, 
the basal bodies are connected by a nonstriated fibrous upper ring, which can be considered the 
result of the fusion of many nonstriated upper connectives. The proximal ends of the basal bod -
ies are partially enclosed in a second lower ring of amorphous material. Four- and six-membered 
microtubular roots depart from between the basal bodies. The microtubular root system of the 
Trentepohliales (Ulvophyceae) motile cells (tetraflagellate zoospores and biflagellate gametes) does 
not follow the X–2–X–2 pattern, but shows a 6–4– 6–4 arrangement in Trentepohlia  sp. The dorso -
ventrally compressed form of the flagellate cells forces the basal bodies and the root system compo -
nents in a flattened arrangement. Basal bodies are aligned perpendicular to the long axis of the cell, 
with a parallel or antiparallel arrangement, and the microtubular rootlets, especially in the gametes, 
extend posteriorly nearly parallel to one another and to the basal body from which they arise. Two of 
the rootlets (the 4-membered rootlets in Trentepohlia  sp.) are associated with a complex columnar 
structure resembling the multilayered structure of the Charophyceae.

which extend from the basal bodies along the cell side down to the posterior. At the level of 
the basal bodies, this broad root enters a multilayered structure in which the microtubules are 
located between two laminate plates.
In the biflagellate male gametes of the Charophyceae, the basal bodies are connected to each 
other by a conspicuous fibrous linkage; the root system consists of a main broad band of microtu -
bules and a small secondary root.
A strongly suggested reading on this topic is the review by Moenstrup (1982).
Haptophyta
In the Haptophyta, there are different types of flagellar roots. Members of the order Pavlovales, 
such as Pavlova  and Diacronema , possess a fibrous root, nonstriated, which extends from the 
base of the anterior flagellum and passes into the cell along the inner face of the nucleus, thus 
becoming progressively wider. In some species, another fibrous root originates at the base of the 
haptonema. Two microtubular roots extend from the base of the posterior flagellum: a seven-
stranded root, which runs under the periplast, and a two-stranded root arising almost at right 
angles to the seven-stranded root, running inside the cell opposite to the haptonema. Fibrous 
connecting bands are present between the basal bodies (Figure 2.52). In the algae of the order 
Coccolithales, such as Pleurochrysis , the structure of the flagellar root system is more complex. 
Three main microtubular roots are associated with the two basal bodies, two broad roots, no. 1 
and no. 2, arising near the left flagellum, and a smaller root, no. 3, arising near the right flagellum. 
Root no. 1 extends from the basal body up toward the cell apex and then curves backward to run 
inside the cell. A fibrous root is associated with root no. 1. Closely packed microtubules organized

are connected to each other by distal, intermediate, and proximal connecting bands. Accessory 
connecting bands link the haptonema to the basal bodies, and the left basal body to the broad 
microtubular root no. 1 (Figure 2.53).
Cryptophyta
The flagellar roots of these algae include two characteristic components, the rhizostyle and the 
compound rootlet. The rhizostyle is a posteriorly directed microtubular structure. It originates 
alongside the basal body of the dorsal flagellum and extends deep into the cell, parallel to the gul -
let, behind the layer of trichocysts, and ends in the posterior part of the cell. On the way, it runs 
through a groove in the nuclear surface. In many cryptomonads, such as Chilomonas , each of the 
rhizostyle microtubules bears a wing-like lamellar projection. The compound rootlet consists of a 
cross-banded fibrous band and microtubular roots. The fibrous band originates from the basal bod -
ies of the dorsal flagellum, but perpendicularly to the rhizostyle. A microtubular root arises near 
the rhizostyle and passes between the basal bodies in close association with the fibrous band; a sec -
ond microtubular root extends dorsolaterally in a curved path, and a third root, which can be very 
short, originates near the rhizostyle and extends anteriorly. In addition to this rootlet, a conspicuous 
12-stranded microtubular root is present in Chilomonas , together with a mitochondrion-associated 
lamella root, while a delicated cross-banded anchoring fiber connecting one of the basal bodies to 
the ventral groove is present in Cryptomonas . The striated components of the root system have been 
shown to contain the contractile protein centrin (Figure 2.54).
Ochrophyta
The root system will be described for each class of this division, selecting when possible a genus 
representing the morphological cell type within the class.
The root system of Ochromonas  can be considered the basic type of the Chrysophyceae. A single 
large cross-banded contractile root, termed rhizoplast, is typically present, associated with the basal

closely against the edge of the chloroplast and reaches the tip of the pyriform nucleus. It then splits 
into several branches, ramifying over the nuclear surface, with some branches located in the narrow 
space between the nucleus and the associated Golgi body. Four microtubular roots, R1, R2, R3 and 
R4, anchor the two flagella in the cell, R1 and R2 associated with the basal body of the long pleuro -
nematic flagellum, and R3 and R4 associated with the basal body of the short smooth flagellum. The 
three-stranded R1 describes an arc in the anterior part of the cell just beneath the cell membrane. 
The two-stranded R2 originates at the opposite side of the basal body, running along the cell mem -
brane. R3 and R4, consisting of a species-specific number of microtubules, arise from the opposite 
sides of the basal body of the short flagellum and form a loop around and under this flagellum. R1 
forms the base of attachment of numerous microtubules running toward the posterior end of the cell, 
with a cytoskeletal function (Figure 2.55).
No complete analysis of the flagellar root systems of Xanthophyceae exists. The typical root sys -
tem as presently understood appears to consist of three different types of structures: a descending 
root originating near the basal bodies, resembling the rhizoplast in extending from the basal bodies 
along the nuclear surface, between the nucleus and the Golgi body, but differing in being unbranched, 
and in consisting of a succession of rectangular blocks rather than fibers as in the Chrysophyceae; a 
cross-banded fibrillar root composed of slightly curved bands, originating together with, but at right 
angles to the descending root, and terminating at the cell membrane; microtubular roots in various 
number near the basal bodies, each of which contains three or four microtubules. In Vaucheria  
(Xanthophyceae), the system is completely different; neither a descending root nor a cross-banded 
fiber is present, but its anterior protrusion is supported by a single broad microtubular root of 8–9 
microtubules arranged in a row. This root originates near the base of the anterior pleuronematic 
flagellum, and from here passes forward along the cell membrane to the tip of the protrusion, turns 
around and runs back on the opposite side of the cell, again along the membrane.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCOnly few data are available on the flagellar roots of Eustigmatophyceae. Both microtubular and 
cross-banded fibrillar types are present. The microtubular structures, consisting of 2–5 microtu -
bules, arise close to the basal bodies and pass anteriorly and posteriorly in the cell. The cross-
banded roots are narrow and pass from the region of the flagellar bases along the anterior flattened 
face of the nucleus.
The ultrastructure of the flagellar root system has been described only in one species of 
Bacillariophyceae, Biddulphia laevis . In the spindle-shaped spermatoids of this centric diatom, a 
system of microtubules radiates from the only basal body present into the cell, to form a cone on the 
anterior part of the nucleus, and at least some of these microtubules extend throughout the length of 
the cell. They appear to maintain the elongated shape of the nucleus and thus probably of the cell 
itself.
An elaborate root system connects the basal bodies to the anterior surface of the nucleus in the 
Raphidophyceae. In Chattonella , two or three roots have been described: one multilayered, associ -
ated with the pleuronematic flagellum, and one with the smooth flagellum. The latter is a band of 
9–10 microtubules which extends from the anterior part of the cell, passing between the basal bod -
ies, and joining with other microtubules before extending along the nucleus in a depression of its 
surface. A large number of distinctly cross-banded fibrous roots are also present, extending from the 
flagellar bases to ensheathe the anterior cone of the nucleus.
In the Phaeophyceae, the structure of the flagellar root system appears remarkably uniform. 
The main characteristic of the system is the root supporting the flat, elastic proboscis in sperma -
tozoids of brown algae. In Fucus , this root is very broad, contains usually seven microtubules (but 
there can be up to 15 microtubules), which travel from the base of the anterior flagellum along the 
plasmalemma to the anterior end of the cell, where the proboscis is located. Here, they bend back 
and run along the cell membrane on the opposite side. A bypassing microtubular root, of about five 
microtubules, originates in the anterior part of the cell, runs along the proboscis root, bypasses the 
basal bodies, without contact, and continues toward the posterior part of the cell. Two other minor 
microtubular roots, consisting of only one microtubule, are present, one extending anteriorly, and 
the other posteriorly. The basal bodies are interlinked by three cross-banded connectives, the del -
toid, the strap-shaped, and the button-shaped bands (Figure 2.56).

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCCercozoa—Chlorarachniophyceae
The single flagellum of the ovoid zoospores of Chlorarachion reptans  possesses a root system that 
consists of a microtubular component appearing as a 3 + 1 structure near the level of emergence 
of the flagellum, soon increasing to 8 + 1, and a second root with a homogeneous substructure that 
occupies a distinct concavity in the nuclear envelope.
In contrast to C. reptans , cells of Bigelowiella natans  are basically biflagellate. The second 
flagellum, however, is exceptionally short and is represented only by a barren basal body inserted 
at approximately right angle to the emergent flagellum. In this alga, the four flagellar roots are 
represented by microtubular structures only with no cross-banded roots. A microtubular root is 
present on either sides of the long flagellum basal body; the largest and most conspicuous root, 
which attaches to the outside of the long flagellum basal body, is five-stranded and forms an “L” in 
the area between the nucleus and the plasma membrane. Just before terminating, this root becomes 
two-stranded. The second microtubular root associated with the long flagellum basal body emerges 
from the corner between the two basal bodies and is one-stranded. The third flagellar root emerges 
on the outside of the short basal body and it is three-stranded. The four microtubular roots are the 
most unusual; they are one-stranded and seem to emerge within the lumen to the short basal body 
next to the cartwheel structure (Figure 2.57).
Mizozoa—Dinophyceae
The root apparatus of these algae is quite complex for number and appearance of ancillary 
structures associated to the microtubular roots and for the spatial relationship between roots 
and other cell organelles. Minor features can be considered species-specific, whereas major 
components are common to almost all the dinoflagellates. The longitudinal basal body and the 
transverse basal body are interconnected by a small striated connective band. A multimembered 
microtubular root, the longitudinal root, originates on the left side of the longitudinal basal body 
and continues posteriorly along the sulcus. A cross-striated fibrous root, the transverse striated 
root, emanates from the left side of the transverse basal body and runs along the transverse fla -
gellar canal and the cingulum. Striated connectives link the transverse striated root to both the 
longitudinal root, and the longitudinal basal body, and the proximal portion of the longitudinal

termed the nuclear fibrous connective, which links the proximal parts of the longitudinal root, 
the transverse striated root, and the transverse and longitudinal basal bodies with the nucleus. 
Fibrous rings with cross-striations, called fibrous collars, encircle the flagellar canals, the lon -
gitudinal striated collar less conspicuous than the transverse striated collar. A nonstriated fiber 
interconnects the two collars. The fibrous elements of this complex root apparatus are likely to 
contain centrin (Figure 2.58).
Euglenozoa—Euglenophyceae
Euglenoids show a rather uniform root structure, with one microtubular root opposite each basal 
body and a single microtubular root in between, termed dorsal, intermediate, and ventral roots 
(Figure 2.59). The dorsal root is anchored to the dorsal basal body at the side furthest from the 
ventral basal body; both the intermediate and ventral roots are associated with the ventral basal 
body at its dorsal and ventral side, respectively. In Euglena mutabilis , the dorsal and the interme -
diate roots consist of three microtubules, while the ventral root consists of five microtubules; in 
E. gracilis , the ventral root is formed by five microtubules as in E. mutabilis , while the microtu -
bules of the dorsal root are more numerous. These roots extend from the basal bodies along the 
reservoir and into the cytoplasm, usually along the cell periphery, but in some species toward 
the nucleus. Flagellar roots are believed to play an important role in maintaining cell shape. In 
some species, the two flagellar basal bodies are connected by a conspicuous transversely striated 
connective.
Besides the intraflagellar accessory structures described above, euglenoids with two emergent 
flagella possess extra-flagellar accessory structures, the so-called rootlets. Two major classes of 
rootlets have been described: microtubular rootlets and filamentous rootlets. Microtubular root -
lets are made of a usually complex and species-specific network (geometry, number of elements) 
anchoring the flagellar apparatus in the whole cell body. However, due to known functions of micro -
tubules in other systems, these microtubules could not only play a role of an anchor, but also provide 
a stable oriented network along which cargos could be transported from inside the cell body to the 
flagellar apparatus.
The filamentous rootlets are made of filaments that can contain centrin. These appendages are 
attached to the pair of basal bodies located at the base of the flagella and extend inside the cyto -
plasm, usually in the direction of the nucleus or along the plasma membrane. Classically, they have 
been considered as anchoring structures providing the role of roots to the whole flagellar apparatus. 
However, they are also contractile structures, which may show transversal striations (centrin type, 
not assembling type) whose periodicity varies with their contraction state.

Cytoplasm, cell walls, and skeletons of algae have a density greater than the medium these organ -
isms dwell in. The density of freshwater is 1.0 g cm−3 and that of seawater ranges from 1.021 to 
1.028 g cm−3, but most cytoplasmic components have a density between 1.03 and 1.10 g cm−3, the 
silica forming the diatom frustule and the scales of Chrysophyceae have a density of 2.6 g cm−3, and 
both calcite and aragonite of Haptophyta coccoliths reach an even higher value of 2.7 g cm−3. With 
this density values, algae must inevitably sink. Therefore, one of the problems planktonic organisms 
face (organisms that wander in the water and/or are carried about by the movements of the water 
rather than by their own ability to swim) is how to keep afloat in a suitable attitude between what -
ever levels are suitable for their life. The phytoplankton must obviously remain floating quite close 
to the surface because only there is a sufficient illumination for photosynthesis. There are broadly 
two solutions by which algae can keep afloat and regulate their orientation and depth: a dynamic 
solution, obtaining lift by swimming, and a static solution, by buoyancy control, or through adapta -
tions reducing sinking rates. In many cases, the two solutions function together.
Swimming
What does swimming mean? It means that an organism immersed in a liquid environment is able to 
sustain movement by deforming its body in a periodic way.
The algae are all good movers or better good swimmers. They swim more or less continuously 
and control their level chiefly by this means. For example, dinoflagellates, which can achieve speed

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCin the range 200–500 μm s−1, are said to maintain themselves near the surface by repeated bursts of 
upward swimming, alternating with short intervals of rest during which they slowly sink. Motility is 
present in unicellular algae or colonies that are propelled by flagella; in some classes, it is confined 
only to gametes and asexual zoospores provided with flagella, which are used as a motor system for 
their displacement in the fluid medium.
In order to move through a fluid, the swimming cell must use its motor system to push a portion 
of the fluid medium in the direction opposite to that in which the movement is to take place.
The physics governing swimming at the micrometer scale experienced by algae is different from 
the physics of swimming at the macroscopic scale. Forward movement of a swimming alga is resisted 
by two things: the inertial resistance of the fluid that must be displaced, which depends upon the den -
sity of the fluid, and the viscous drag experienced by the moving organism, that is, the rearward force 
exerted on the organism by the fluid molecules adhering to its surface when it passes through the vis -
cous fluid. The world of microorganisms is the world of low “Reynolds number,” a world where inertia 
plays little role and viscous damping is paramount. The Reynolds number ( R) is defined as the ratio of 
inertial and viscous forces; it depends on the size of the organism (related to the linear dimension, l), 
its velocity ( u), and to the density ( ρ) and viscosity ( η) of the fluid medium according to the equation:
 Rl u ==−−() () . inertia lforces viscous forces11rh  (2.1)
Since the ratio between the viscosity and the density is the kinematic viscosity ( ν = ηρ−1 in 
cm2 s−1), Equation 2.1 can be written as
 R = luv−1 (2.2)
FIGURE 2.59  Root system of Euglenophyceae. F1, F2: flagella; DR: dorsal root; IR: intermediate root; VR: 
ventral root; TSC: transversely striated connective.95 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCIn water, at 20°C the kinematic viscosity is 10−2 cm2 s−1.
A 50- μm long alga swimming at 10 μm s−1 has the minuscule Reynold’s number of 5 × 10−4, 
hence inertial effects are vanishing small and the major constraint is the viscous drag; this means 
that what an algae is doing at the moment is entirely determined by the forces that are exerted on it 
at that moment , and by nothing in the past. Therefore, when the flagellum stops, forward movement 
of the cell will cease abruptly without gradual deceleration.
Swimming strategies employed by larger organisms that operate at high Reynolds number, such 
as fish, birds, or insects, are ineffective at the small scale. Reynolds number might rise up to 105 
for a fish that is 10 cm long and swims at 1 m s−1. If the same fish would be swimming at the same 
Reynolds number of an alga, it would be as if it was swimming inside molasses. Any attempt to 
move by imparting momentum to the fluid, as is done in paddling, will be foiled by the large viscous 
damping. Therefore, microorganisms have evolved propulsion strategies that successfully overcome 
and exploit drag.
Another funny thing about motion at low Reynolds number is reciprocal motion. Since time does 
not matter, the deformation that produces the swimming must be asymmetrical. Therefore, the pat -
tern of flagellar beating must be 3D and asymmetric, that is, the forward stroke should be different 
from the reverse.
For optimum propulsive efficiency, cell body size should be 15–40 times the flagellum radius 
(about 0.1 μm) and this ratio is present in many algae. When the cell body size is larger than pre -
dicted, as in Euglena , the effective radius of the flagellum is modified by simple, nontubular hairs.
Beat patterns of most smooth flagella (i.e., without hairs) are three-dimensional, and the analy -
sis of the motion is far from straightforward. However, it is clear that the direction in which the 
microorganism moves is opposite to the direction in which the waves are propagated along the 
length of the flagellum, so that in almost all cases, when the cell body is to be pushed along, a 
wave must be initiated at the base of the smooth flagellum. Although basal initiation is more com -
mon than distal, both are known. The velocity of forward movement is always a small fraction of 
the velocity of the wave running along the flagellum, and its propulsive efficiency depends on the 
ratio of its amplitude and wavelength. Unlike smooth flagella, the propulsive force generated by 
a flagellum bearing tubular hairs is in the same direction of wave propagation. These stiff hairs 
remain perpendicular to the axis of the flagellum as it bends (Figure 2.60). A wave moving away 
from the cell body will cause the hairs to act as oars, and the overall effect will be to propel the 
cell flagellum first.
Control characteristics, and thus behavioral peculiarities, are connected with the functioning of 
the propelling structure of the cell. If the cell is asymmetric, it advances spinning along its axis; it 
can correct its trajectory only by sudden steering obtained by changing the insertion angle of fla -
gella or by the stiffening of internal structures. This behavior can be attributed to all heterokont or 
uniflagellate algae. In the case of a symmetric cell, it can accomplish a gradual smooth correction 
of its trajectory going forward without spinning (or rotating with a very long period), and displacing 
the barycenter of the motor couple. This behavior can be attributed to all isokont cells.
Examples of main swimming patterns among algae will be described in the following.
In Ochromonas  sp. (Ochrophyta), only the flagellum bearing hairs seems to be active during 
swimming (Figure 2.60). It is directed forward and executes simultaneous undulatory and helical 
waves that travel from its base to the tip. The resulting flagellum movements cause the whole body 
of the cell to rotate as it moves forwards. The shorter flagellum trails backward passively, lying 
against the cell; it is capable of acting as a rudder to steer the cells. The two rows of stiff hairs cause 
a reversal of the flagellum thrust. Water is propelled along the flagellum from the tip to the base, so 
that the cell is towed forward in the direction of the flagellum (Figure 2.61).
In desmokont dinoflagellates such as Prorocentrum  sp., the longitudinal flagellum, which extends 
apically, beats with an anterior-to-posterior whipping action, generating a wave in a tip-to-base 
mode. The second flagellum, perpendicular to the first, is coiled and attached to the cell body except 
for the tip, which beats in a whiplash motion, while the attached part undulates (Figure 2.62). In 96 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCdinokont dinoflagellates, such as Peridinium  sp. or Gymnodinium  sp., the two flagella emerge at the 
intersection of the cingulum (transverse furrow) and sulcus (longitudinal sulcus). The longitudinal 
flagellum extends apically running in the sulcus and is the propelling and steering flagellum, while 
the ribbon-shaped transverse flagellum is coiled, lies perpendicular to the first and runs around 
the cell in the cingulum. It is thought to be responsible for driving the cell forward and it also

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCbrings about rotation. The longitudinal flagellum beats with a planar waveform, which contributes 
to forward movement. The longitudinal flagellum can also reverse the swimming direction: it stops 
beating, points in a different direction by bending, and then resumes beating. This steering ability 
is related to change in orientation of basal bodies and contraction of the structures associated to the 
axoneme. In the transverse flagellum, a spiral wave generated in a base-to-tip mode is propagated 
along the axoneme, bringing about backward thrust and rotation and at the same time (Figure 2.63).
As said above, the emergent flagellum of Euglena  sp. (Euglenophyceae) bears simple hairs 3–4-
μm long. These long hairs are arranged in tufts of 3–4 and form a single row that runs along the 
flagellum spirally with a low pitch. The flagellar hairs increase the thrust of the flagellum against the 
surrounding water. During swimming, the long flagellum trails beside the cell body and performs 
helical waves, generated in a base-to-tip mode (Figure 2.64).
A peculiar swimming pattern is present in the ovoid zoospores of Chlorarachnion reptans  and 
Bigelowiella natans  (Chlorarachniophyceae), which bear a single flagellum inserted a little below 
the cell apex. This flagellum bears very delicate hairs markedly different from the tubular hairs 
of Heterokontophyta. During swimming, the flagellum wraps back around the cell in a downward 
spiral, lying in a groove along the cell body. The cells rotate around the longitudinal axis during 
swimming and the anterior or posterior end of the cell moves in either narrow or wide helical path 
that appears as a side-to-side rocking or wobbling (Figure 2.65).
In isokont biflagellate algae such as Chlamydomonas  or Dunaliella  (Chlorophyta), during the 
effective stroke, the flagella bend only at the base and push more water backward than adhering 
to them during the forward recovery stroke, thus bringing about net forward movement. While

FIGURE 2.64  Swimming pattern of Euglena gracilis.98 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCswimming, these cells also rotate. Speeds ranging from 100 to 200 μm s−1 can be reached by these 
cells during forward swimming. Backward swimming is also possible, during which the flagella 
perform undulatory movements (Figure 2.66).
When the flagellar are four, and different in length (two shorter and two longer), as in 
Tetraflagellochloris mauritanica  (Chlorophyceae), the swimming motion is more complex. This alga, 
which can be either single or in a group, shows a peculiar swimming motion, consisting of alternat -
ing short, rapid swimming phases and longer resting phases (maximum speed of about 200 μm s−1). 
They swim mainly with the anterior end forward by beating the four flagella, which beat synchro -
nously and unidirectionally behind the cell. The planar, undulatory waves propagate from the base 
and along the lengths of the four flagella, a swimming behavior considered quite primitive. Cells 
suddenly stop by throwing the flagella forward, which recover the bent configuration of the resting 
phase by assuming what appears to be a “braking” movement (Figure 2.67). The cells can also swim 
backward, although this motion seems to be used only during settling, with a ciliary beating that pro -
ceeds in fits and starts and appears to be rigid and limited to the part of the flagella distal to the bend.
An interesting question is why the algae swim?
All algae in an aquatic environment have a need to exchange molecules such as O2, CO2, NH3 
with environment. Since all solid boundaries in a liquid medium have associated with them a bound -
ary layer in which water movement is reduced (due to the no-slip boundary), this layer will impede 
the nutrient uptake of the organisms by creating a small depleted layer around them. Turbulence is 
very ineffective in transporting nutrients toward such small organisms as the smallest length scale 
of turbulent eddies are in the order of several millimeters. Therefore, algae must rely on molecular 
diffusion to overcome the nutrient gradient across the boundary layer. Diffusion, that is, the slow 
mixing caused by the random motion of molecules, is important in the world of low Reynolds 
FIGURE 2.65  Swimming pattern of Bigelowiella  sp.
FIGURE 2.66  Swimming pattern of isokont biflagellate algae ( Dunaliella salina ).99 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCnumber, because of this world stirring is not any good. The alga’s problem is not its energy supply; 
its problem is its environment. At low Reynolds number, you cannot shake off your environment. If 
you move, you take it along; it only gradually falls behind.
Algae use their motility (be it sinking or swimming) to generate movement relative to the water 
and hence replenish the boundary layer with nutrients. Depending on the size of the organism, the 
motive for swimming must differ; however, its effects differ significantly. For small algae in the 
1–10- μm range, diffusion is about 100 times more effective in supplying nutrients than movement. 
This is often expressed as the Sherwood number ( S):
 S=() ( time fortranspor tbydiffusion time fortranspor tbymovement ))
() () () ,−
−− −−==1
21 11 1LD Lu Lu D  (2.3)
where L is the distance over which the nutrient is to be transported, u the water velocity, and D the 
diffusion constant.
For scale in the order of 1 μm, the ratio is ≈10−2. Diffusion is about 100 times faster than move -
ment. Hence, in this world of low Reynolds numbers, nothing is gained by trying to reduce the 
diffusion barrier by generating turbulent advection. In this contest, the only possible advantage to 
the alga of undertaking locomotion is that it might encounter nutrients in a higher concentration. 
For this purpose, a helical swimming path is more useful than a straight one in spite of the longer 
distance for the same displacement. This is because a helical swimming path enables detection of 
3D component of a gradient, whereas the straight path allows detection of only one dimension.
Purcell (1977) summarized it by saying that the organism does not move like a cow that is graz -
ing on pasture, it moves to find a greener pasture.
Only the species that swim very fast such as the dinoflagellates (about 500 μm s−1) can overcome 
the diffusion limitation. This high velocity should be related to the effective increase in the prob -
ability to catch more preys and therefore to the heterotrophy metabolism of the algal species.
Movements Other than Swimming
In some algae, movement cannot occur unless the cells are in contact with a solid substratum. 
This kind of movement, in some cases termed gliding, is present in cyanobacteria, in the red alga 
Porphyridium  (Rhodophyta), in diatoms, and in some desmids (Chlorophyta).
The most efficient gliders among the cyanobacteria are found in the filamentous forms such as 
Oscillatoria , Spirulina , Phormidium , and Anabaena , which can travel at up to 10 μm s−1. Some 
species, such as Phormidium uncinatum  and Oscillatoria , rotate about their long axis while 
gliding; while others, such as Anabaena variabilis  translate laterally. Other unicellular coccoid 
FIGURE 2.67  Swimming pattern of a quadriflagellate alga ( Tetraflagellochloris mauritanica ).100 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCcyanobacteria, such as Synechocystis , move by “twitching,” a flagella-independent form of translo -
cation over moist surfaces. This type of motility is analogous to social gliding motility (S-motility) 
in myxobacteria, which involves coordinated movements of cells close to each other (cell–cell inter -
actions) and requires both Type IV pili operating in a manner similar to a grappling hook and 
fibrils (extracellular matrix material consisting of polysaccharides and proteins). While moving, 
cyanobacterial gliders secrete mucilage, or slime, which plays an active role in gliding. Mucilage is 
extruded from rows of fine pores clustered circumferentially around the septa. These pores are part 
of a larger structure called the junctional pore complex (JPC), which spans the entire cell wall, pep -
toglycan layer, and outer membrane. The channels formed by the JPCs are inclined relative to the 
cell axis, this angle providing directionality to the extruded slime, and are oppositely directed on 
either side of the septum. Propulsion of the filament results from the adherence of the slime to both 
the filament surface and the substratum, combined with its extrusion from a row of JPCs on one 
side of each septum. Switching slime extrusion to the JPCs on the other side of the septum would 
result in a reversal of the direction of gliding. In P. uncinatum , the pores are aligned in a single row, 
whereas in A. variabilis  several rows of pores line both sides of the septum. The outer surface of 
gliding cyanobacteria consists of parallelly arranged fibrils of a glycoprotein known as oscillin, a 
Ca-binding protein required for motility. The surface striations formed by these fibrils would act as 
channels for the extruded slime to flow along. Therefore, if the fibrils are helically arranged, the cell 
will rotate as it glides; if the fibrils are aligned radially, the cell will not rotate. In all species studied 
to date, this correlation is consistent and provides a structural explanation for why some species 
rotate as they glide while others do not.
In diatoms, motility is restricted to pennate species possessing a raphe. These diatoms display a 
characteristic jerky movement forward or backward, with species-specific path patterns. The general 
velocity of their movement is 1–25 μm s−1, but they can accelerate up to 100–200 μm s−1. Raphid 
diatoms possess an actin-based cytoskeletal system located just beneath the plasma membrane at 
the raphe. Transmembrane components with an adhesive extracellular domain are connected to 
these actin bundles and their interaction is somehow involved in both adhesion and motility mecha -
nisms. Microtubules are also present in this region; in addition, secretory vesicles containing poly -
saccharides often appear near the actin filaments at the raphe, providing the mucilage strands that 
project from the raphe and adhere to the substratum during the gliding process.
At least two models exist that provide reasonable explanation for diatom locomotion. In the first 
model, a force applied to the transmembrane protein–actin connectors, parallel to the actin bundles, 
would result in movement of the transmembrane proteins through the cell and the subsequent move -
ment of the cell in the direction opposite to the force. In the second model, the energy required for 
motility would be generated by a conformational change of the adhesive mucilage on hydration that 
occurs when it is secreted from the raphe. In this model, the actin bundles restrict the secretion of 
mucilage to one end of the raphe, which generates a net force moving the cell over the site of secretion. 
In both models, the secreted mucilage plays a central role either by providing traction to translate the 
force into cell movement or by generating the energy through conformational changes on hydration.
A slow gliding movement over solid substrata has been observed in Porphyridium  sp. 
(Rhodophyta) and in some desmids (Chlorophyta). In Porphyridium , the mucilage produced in 
mucilage sacs located inside the cell is excreted through the membrane. In desmids, mucilage is 
excreted through the cell wall by flask-shaped pores. As they move, these gliding cells leave behind 
a fibrillar mucilaginous trail, whose swelling by water pushes the cells forward.
Table 2.1 presents swimming and gliding speeds of some planktonic algae.
Buoyancy Control
The alternative to swimming is to float by means of some types of buoyancy device. In some of 
the attached brown algae of the seashore ( Fucus vesicolosus , Ascophyllum nodosum , Sargassum  
sp., Ochrophyta), the fronds gain buoyancy from air bladders (pneumatocysts) within the thallus, 
which stands erect when submerged. Oxygen and nitrogen, in roughly the same proportion as in air, 101 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCform the bulk of the gas, but there are also small, variable amount of CO2 and CO. Oxygen and CO2 
derive partly from the metabolic activities of the cells in the pneumatocyst wall, and diurnal changes 
in the composition and pressure of pneumatocyst gases have been shown. However, equilibration 
takes place between the gases in the pneumatocyst and in the surrounding water (or air). This is the 
source of nitrogen in the vesicles and also the major source of O2 and CO2. In Enteromorpha  sp. 
(Chlorophyta), gas bubbles are entrapped in the central area of its tubular hollow thallus, which may 
aid in keeping the stipe upright by flotation. In other seaweeds such as Codium fragile  (Chlorophyta), 
gas trapped among the filaments achieves the same buoyancy effect of pneumatocysts.
Buoyancy regulation in cyanobacteria involves production of intracellular gas-filled structures 
(also termed vacuoles), not delimited by membranes, and made up of assemblages of hollow cylin -
ders, whose proteinaceous walls are permeable to gas, but not to water. The density of this structure 
is about 0.12 g cm−3, about one-eighth of that of water, and if sufficient gas-filled structures are pres -
ent in a cell, it can become positively buoyant. In cyanobacteria, buoyancy is regulated by varying 
gas-filled structure formation and cytoplasmatic composition through synthesis and breakdown of 
photosynthetic products. The production of gas-filled structures is induced by low-light conditions 
(e.g., in deep layers with insufficient light). Here, photosynthesis is reduced, osmotic pressure of 
newly synthesized sugars is small, and ballast materials such as carbohydrates are not produced at 
a high rate, and therefore they will not increase cell density, which in turn would increase sinking. 
Under these conditions, gas-filled structures can be produced at a high rate and cells increase their 
buoyancy. Conversely, if cell osmotic potential is high (high sugar production, increased amount of 
ballast in the form of secondary photosynthetic products), hence turgor pressure increases, it may 
collapse gas-filled structure, and cells become negatively buoyant sink in the water column. The 
rise in turgor pressure with light irradiance has been found in many cyanobacteria; however, for this 
rise to result in gas-filled structure regulation, the pressure reached must exceed the lowest pressure 
of gas-filled structures. This occurs, for example, in Anabaena flos -aquae , with a critical collapse 
pressure distributed about a mean of 6 bar. In Trichodesmium  sp., gas-filled structures can with -
stand pressures of 12–37 bar depending on the species, and turgor pressure collapse is not possible 
as a buoyancy regulation mechanism in this genus; carbohydrate ballasting is considered the only 
plausible mechanism for rapid buoyancy shifts in this cyanobacterium.TABLE 2.1

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCOther algae obtain buoyancy from liquids of lower specific gravity than seawater or freshwater 
in a way similar to a bathyscaphe. Liquid-filled floats have the advantage of being virtually incom -
pressible; but because of their higher density, they must comprise a much greater proportion of the 
organism’s overall volume than is necessary with gas-filled floats if they are to give equivalent lifts. 
The large central vacuole of diatoms contains cell sap of reduced density, obtained by the selective 
accumulation of K+ and Na+, which replace the heavier divalent ions, conferring some buoyancy. 
In young, fast-growing cultures, diatom cells often remain suspended, or sink only very slowly, 
although in older cultures they usually sink more rapidly. Studies of the distribution of diatoms 
in the sea suggest that some species undergo diurnal changes of depth, usually rising nearer the 
surface during daylight and sinking lower in darkness, possibly due to slight alterations of their 
overall density effected by changes in specific gravity of the cell sap, or in some cases by formation 
or disappearance of gas vacuoles in the cytoplasm. The dinoflagellate Noctiluca  also gain buoyancy 
from a high concentration of NH4+ ions in its large vacuoles, exclusion of relatively heavy divalent 
ions, especially sulfate, and a high intracellular content of Na+ ions relative to K+. As a result, the 
density of the cell sap in the vacuoles is less than that of seawater, and the cells can therefore be 
positively buoyant and float.
When buoyancy control is not possible by these mechanisms, algae can keep afloat and regulate 
their orientation and depth through adaptations reducing sinking rates. The rate at which a small 
object sinks in water varies with the amount by which its weight exceeds that of the water it dis -
places, and inversely with the viscous forces between the surface of the object and the water. The 
viscous forces opposing the motion are approximately proportional to the surface area, and there -
fore, other things being equal, the greater the surface area, the slower the sinking rate.
There are a number of structural features of planktonic organisms, which increase their surface 
area and must certainly assist in keeping them afloat. The majority of planktons are of small size, 
and therefore have a large surface-to-volume ratio. In many cases, modifications of the body sur -
face increase its area with very little increase in weight. These modifications generally take two 
forms: a flattening of the body, or an expansion of the body surface into spines, bristles, knobs, 
wings, or fins.
A great range of flattened or elaborately ornamented shapes occur in diatoms such as Chaetoceros  
sp. In dinoflagellates, also, the cell wall is in some cases prolonged into spines ( Ceratium ) or wings 
(Dinophysis ). Among the Chlorophyceae, the wall of the peripheral cells of Pediastrum  colonies 
may bear clusters of very long and delicate chitinous bristles regarded as buoyancy devices. In 
Scenedesmus  also, the cells are clothed by large number of bristles with a complex structure, which 
seem to help keep the cells in suspension.
Reduction of the sinking rate is also obtained by an increase in lipid content, which has a density 
of about 0.86 g cm−3. Oil droplets are common inclusions in the cytoplasm of algae; lipids stored in 
this form are present in the Chrysophyceae and Phaeophyceae (Ochrophyta), and in the Haptophyta, 
Cryptophyta, and Dinophyceae. The thermal expansion of these compounds may be of some signifi -
cance in effecting diurnal depth changes, through reduction of cell density, but without producing 
neutral buoyancy.
How a Flagellum Is Built: The Intraflagellar Transport
The mechanisms that determine and preserve the size and function of cellular organelles represent 
a fundamental question in cell biology up to now only partially understood, and flagella have pro -
vided a handy model system to investigate organelles’ size-control analysis. It was discovered that 
flagella are dynamic structures and that flagellar length is regulated by a process called intraflagel -
lar transport (IFT). IFT is a motile process within flagella in which large protein complexes move 
from one end of the flagellum to the other, and flagellar length is regulated by a balance between 
continuous assembly of tubulin at the tip of the flagellum, counterbalanced by continuous disassem -
bly. According to Iomini et al. (2001), the IFT cycle consists of four phases. In phase I, which takes 
place in the basal body region of the flagellum, anterograde particles are assembled from retrograde 103 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCparticles by remodeling and/or exchange of subunits with the cell body cytoplasm, with a concur -
rent decrease in number. In this phase, the precursors of the flagellar structures that make up the 
cargos are also loaded onto the particles. In phase II, the particles are transported from the base 
to the distal end of the flagellum by a heterometric kinesin II with a velocity of about 2 μm s−1. In 
phase III, which occurs at the distal end of the flagellum, anterograde particles are remodeled into 
retrograde particles with a concurrent increase in number, probably upon or after unloading their 
cargo. Finally, in phase IV, retrograde particles are transported by a cytoplasmic flagellar dynein 
from the distal end back to the basal body region of the flagellum, with a velocity of about 3 μm s−1, 
higher than that of anterograde particles.
How a Flagellar Motor Works
Movement can arise by shape change of permanently linked elements, by reversible interactions 
causing movement of elements relative to each other, by reversible assembly and disassembly, 
etc. all of which need energy input. We know that such changes can occur in proteins, the most 
likely molecules serving these locomotory functions in real movement system. But what drives 
and controls these changes? In principle, the problem is not difficult. Altering the ionic milieu, 
changing chemically or electrically its environment can in turn alter the tertiary and/or quater -
nary structure of a protein. In most control systems, if not all, a change in the environment brings 
about a change in the properties of the motor, acting either directly or indirectly on the component 
of the motor. We need only two proteins to make a motor using the sliding filaments mechanism, 
that is, a globular protein (such as tubulin) and an anchor protein (such as the dynein–dynactin 
complex). If the globular protein can polymerize, we can assemble it into a linear polymer that 
can be attached via the anchor protein to another structure some distance away. The transforma -
tion of chemical energy into mechanical work depends on a conformational change of the anchor 
protein, which uses the hydrolysis of ATP in ADP. Provided the anchor protein repeats the con -
formational change upon each monomer of the globular protein in turn, the “boat” can be hauled 
“hand over hand” toward the distant anchorage. Provided some kind of metachrony regulates 
adjacent motor molecules, we can link our small movements in a temporal series to amplify the 
amount of movement that can be achieved. Each step costs hydrolysis of one ATP molecule per 
anchor protein. The simplest and most obvious solution is either to have more than one anchor 
protein, or to have a dimer, working out-of-phase, being careful not to detach before the new 
attachment is formed. For instance, most (but not all) microtubular motors (dyneins, kinesins) 
work as dimers whose subunits walk along microtubule walls just like human legs walk on a 
surface. Once we have two hands to pull on the rope, we can indeed move hand over hand; the 
one-armed man cannot do more than pull once. The flagellum movements are due to the transient 
interaction between two anchored microtubules, coupled to a linkage control. The generation 
of sliding of adjacent doublets by flagellar dynein is combined to the resisting forces localized 
near the active sliding rows of dyneins. During the cycle of binding/release obtained by dynein 
conformational change coupled to ATP hydrolysis, chemical energy is converted into mechanical 
energy used for sliding. Owing to their regular spacing every 24 nm along the axoneme, several 
adjacent dyneins participate to this local sliding, and their functioning proceeds by local waves 
that propagate step by step all the way along the flagella. The postulated regulator has therefore 
to trigger the functioning of the different dyneins alternatively along the length as well as around 
the section of the axoneme, but its molecular nature remains unknown.
The model of Lindemann (1994) accounts for wave generation and propagation, regulated by 
geometrical constraints. This model, the so-called “geometric clutch,” is based on the way a cyl -
inder with nine generatrix (the nine outer doublets of the axoneme) changes form when submitted 
to bending. In the zone of curvature, the doublets located outside the curvature are brought apart, 
while the doublets located inside the curvature come closer to each other. This makes the cor -
responding dynein molecules efficient for sliding. In contrast, dynein molecules located outside 
the curvature are too far for binding to adjacent microtubules: no active sliding can occur in this 104 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCzone. This model is consistent with ultrastructural data of electron microscopy. As above, the 
functioning of the axonemal mechanics needs transient connections, which could possibly be 
disrupted by intrinsic proteolytic activities due to the combined activities of a protease/ligase 
system.
How a Paraxial Rod Works
Since the PFR and the axoneme are very tightly connected, both structures have to move together. 
It can be argued that the PFR contributes to regulate the flagellar movements. This could be done 
by providing a more rigid structure that can vary its stiffness in time, that is, modifying flagellum-
beating pattern.
We need only one protein to build a device for information transfer and control, that is, a protein 
with two conformational, alternate states such as intermediate filament proteins, which can form 
lattice-like structures. The propagation of conformational changes along these proteins can be used 
to transport and/or transduce sensory information. Each protein can be considered as a dipole in 
one of the two possible states. We can imagine that the conformational change is transmitted by one 
dipole to the neighbor proteins as a wave. Therefore, a current flow through these lattice-like struc -
tures could be generated by the mobile electrons of the proteins that interact with their immediate 
neighbors via dipole–dipole forces.
The α-helical coiled-coil structural motif in the rod filament is well suited for electron propaga -
tion (Figure 2.36b). A current might be propagated distally, via PFR1 and PFR2 protein–protein 
charge transfers in the lattice-like rod filaments. The current flows through these lattice-like struc -
tures and the sole constraint is that each lattice site should possess a dipole moment proportional to 
the magnitude of the mobile charge unit and the distance over which it hops, that is, about 1–2 nm. 
This wave produces a contraction in the PFR and a varying internal resistance that modulates the 
flagellar beats. The contraction occurs by displacement of the goblet appendages of the PFR along 
the axonemal microtubules, which reduces the distance between the coiled filaments, hence gen -
erating longitudinal waves of contraction along the paraxial rod. The stiffening should swing the 
flagellum sideways, damping out some undulatory waves of the axoneme.
The phoTorecep Tor appara Ta
In aquatic ecosystems, light is a physical factor of fundamental importance to both photosynthetic 
and (nonphotosynthetic) heterotrophic organisms. They are able to sense and respond to light stim -
uli, an ability essential to optimize physiological processes, and to time their lives to feeding, repro -
duction, defense, and virtually all their functions. One of the most striking responses is phototaxis, 
in which motile photosynthetic microorganisms adjust their swimming path with respect to incident 
light in a finely tuned manner. Many are the advantages of phototaxis: it allows photosynthetic 
organisms to position themselves for optimal light capture and efficient photosynthesis and facili -
tates avoidance responses in those situations where light is intense enough to damage pigments and 
chloroplasts. In the case of many sexually reproducing species, such as Ulva  sp. (Chlorophyta), 
both female and male gametes show positive phototaxis, which may cause the colocalization of 
both gametes near the surface of seawater improving the possibility of encountering. On the other 
hand, zygotes usually become negatively phototactic, enabling them to swim towards the bottom 
of the seashore where they can find a suitable substratum. Also, nonphotosynthetic organisms (het -
erotrophic) have shown to benefit the ecological advantages of phototaxis. For example, the marine 
dinoflagellate predator Oxyrrhis marina  can orient to light and is able to use photosensory response 
to locate patches of phytoplankton prey by detection of chlorophyll a fluorescence.
The full exploitation of light information necessitates proper perceiving devices, able to change the 
small signal represented by the light falling upon them in a larger signal and response of an entirely 
different physical nature, that is, these devices, termed photoreceptors, must act as sensors, to perceive 
wavelength and direction of light, as transducers, to convert the light signal not only into chemical 105 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCand/or electrical information, but also as amplifiers and eventually as transmitters. Hence, photorecep -
tors can be considered algal “eyes,” with many similarities with the complex vision systems of higher 
organisms, since they do possess optics, photoreceptors, and signal transduction chain components.
The proper functioning of these basic visual systems relies on some necessary and universal 
structural, behavioral, and physiological features, such as the following:
• Shading device (structural)
• Photoreceptor and photoreceptive proteins (structural)
• Sampling strategies (behavioral)
• Trajectory control (behavioral)
• Signal transmission (physiological)
The shading device and the photoreceptor are the structural elements used to screen the environ -
ment and provide information about the intensity and directionality of the incident light. These two 
elements are always in close association. The shading device, termed eyespot, is usually an absorb -
ing element that prevents light coming from certain direction from reaching the detector.
In flagellate algae, eyespot position is usually strictly defined with respect to the plane of beat 
of the flagella, though variation exists; however, along the longitudinal cell axis, the eyespot being 
located either more anteriorly or more posteriorly. The position of the eyespot gives the algae dis -
tinctive left–right asymmetry. The typical organization of the eyespot consists of a single layer of 
closely packed globules containing mainly carotenoids that can play the shading role, thanks to their 
strong absorbance in the 400–500-nm range.
The most common (and primitive) type of photoreceptor consists of extensive two-dimensional 
(2D) patches of photosensitive proteins, embedded in the plasma membrane in close association 
with the eyespot; the proteins have an ordered disposition in order to maximize light absorption. For 
detecting the direction of light of a specific spectral range, a photoreceptor demands a high pack -
ing density of chromophore molecules organized in a lattice structure, with high absorption cross-
section of the chromophore, that is, high probability of photon absorption by the chromophore, and 
very low dark noise. The dark noise is the noise inherent in a receptor, constant, and independent 
of light level, which arises from the random thermal motions of the molecules. For detecting pat -
terns of light, the number and location of photoreceptors, having fixed size and exposure time, must 
be viewed according to the pattern of motion of algae; therefore, the design of the photoreceptive 
apparatus in conjunction with the helical movement of the cell produces a highly directional optical 
device allowing effective tracking of the light direction. The function of photoreception is insepa -
rable from the presence of photoreceptive proteins, but not necessarily from the presence of an 
eyespot; hence, when the eyespot is absent, its function must be performed by the whole algal body.
Only few photoreceptors can be identified by optical microscopy (Figure 1.56), whereas the eye -
spot is always easily recognizable because of its size and colour, usually orange-red (Figure 2.68).

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCTYPES OF PHOTORECEPTIVE SYSTEMS
Depending on their organization and structure, photoreceptive systems can be grouped into three 
main types.
Type i
A single layer of photoreceptor molecules is present inside the whole-cell membrane or located 
in just the patch of membrane that covers the eyespot when present (Figure 2.69). Lacking the 
eyespot, the whole algal body performs the shading function. This means that this type of pho -
toreceptive system could not be readily visible. This type of photoreceptive system is typical of 
Chlorophyta, but is present also in Cyanobacteria, Ochrophyta, Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, and 
Dinophyceae.
In Chlorophyta such as Haematococcus  sp., Spermatozopsis  sp., and Dunaliella  sp., the eye -
spot is situated on one side of the cell, sometimes slightly protruding beyond the cell surface, as 
in the gametes of Ulva ; its area can range from about 0.3 to 10 μm2. The globules range from 80 
to 190 nm in diameter and their number varies from 30 to approximately 2000. The most com -
mon organization consists of a single layer of closely packed globules lying between the outermost 
thylakoid and the two-layered chloroplast membrane. Additional layers of globules can be present 
underneath the first layer, individual layers subtended or not by a single thylakoid. In most species, 
the globules show a hexagonal packing, which enables the highest possible packing density. In both 
Pandorina  and Volvox  colonies, the eyespot of cells in the anterior of the colony are larger than 
those of the posterior, consisting of up to nine layers, marking the occurrence of some degree of 
colony polarity.
The photoreceptor of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  can be considered the model of Type I photo -
receptor. The eyespot is about 1 μm in length, located at the equator of the cell, usually composed 
of two organized rows of carotenoid-filled lipid globules separated by thylakoid membranes, and 
packed under the chloroplast envelope. The layered structure of the shading organelle in this type of 
photoreceptor reflects orthogonal light toward the photoreceptor and blocks light originating from 
other directions. The photoreceptor of the green alga Chlamydomonas  consists of an extensive 2D 
patch of photosensitive proteins in the plasma membrane that lies directly over the closely apposed 
chloroplast envelope at the level of the eyespot (Figure 2.69). This photoreceptor has been visual -
ized by immunofluorescence microscopy.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCIn Cyanobacteria, phototactic orientation has been described in A. variabilis , Pseudoanabaena  
sp., and Phormidium , although no defined structure for light sensing have been detected so far. The 
first identification of a complex photoreceptive system leading to the evidence of a photoreceptive 
protein was performed in Leptolyngbya  sp. This deep red cyanobacterium lives in Roman hypogea 
at extremely low light intensity (1013 photons  m−2 s−1). It possesses an orange eyespot at the tip of 
the apical cell of the trichome. Electron microscopy revealed that this eyespot is characterized by 
osmiophilic globules of about 100 nm in diameter arranged in a peripheral cap extending 2–3 μm 
from the apex and with a possible layered pattern (Figure 2.2). Microspectrophotometric analysis of 
the tip of the apical cell of Leptolyngbya  trichomes revealed a complex absorption spectrum with 
two main bands. The band centered at 456 nm is due to the absorption of the carotenoid present 
in the eyespot, whereas the band centered at 504 nm can be assigned to rhodopsin-like molecules 
packed in the plasma membrane of the tip of the apical cell.
In Ochrophyta, data exist indicating that the photoreceptor molecules are present inside the cell 
membrane of zygotes of the fucoid brown algae, Fucus  sp. and Silvetia compressa.  Experimental 
work confirmed this localization in S. compressa  (Figure 2.70a), where a rhodopsin-like protein was 
identified in the zygote membrane (Figure 2.70b). Since no eyespot can be detected in these algal 
stages, the shading function is assigned to the whole-cell body.
In the Haptophyta, the eyespot is present only in some species of the order Pavlovales. It con -
sists of a single layer of globules situated at the anterior end of one of the chloroplasts, beneath the 
posteriorly directed flagellum, at the level of its emersion from the cell. In these algae, the photore -
ceptor has not yet been localized, but we can presume it is positioned inside the membrane in close 
association with the eyespot.
In the Cryptophyta, the presence of an eyespot is limited to a small number of species belonging 
to the genus Chroomonas . The eyespot is situated at the center of the cell, within a conical lobe of 
the chloroplast. It consists of a single layer of about 35 closely packed globules, attached to the chlo -
roplast envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum. Also in these algae, the photoreceptive proteins 
should be located inside the plasma membrane overlaying the eyespot.
In the Dinophyceae, the eyespot is chloroplastic in Peridiniun  sp., consisting of a layer of glob -
ules under the chloroplast envelope, situated behind the longitudinal sulcus, and truly extraplastidic 
in Woloszynskia coronata , where it consists of an irregular cluster of globules located beneath the 
sulcus, and immediately adjacent to the subthecal microtubules. In the latter, neither a connection 
with the chloroplast nor membranes surrounding the eyespot are present. Glenodinium foliaceum  and 
Peridinium balticum  possess another type of eyespot. It is roughly a triangular body situated behind 
the sulcus and is an independent structure bounded by a three-membrane envelope. Basically, there 
are two layers of pigmented globules, separated by a vesicle of granular material. The eyespot can fold

located along the right edge of the sulcus. Its color is a shade of greenish-yellow rather than the red -
dish-orange color commonly found in eyespot; it consists of up to six flat rows of bric-like units, each 
row contained in a vesicle bounded by a unit membrane. No data exist on the photoreceptor location in 
these dinoflagellates, but the assumption is the same made for the Haptophyta and Cryptophyta, that 
is, photoreceptive proteins must be located inside the plasma membrane close to the eyespot.
A separate case is that of Alexandrium hiranoi  and Gymnodinium mikimotoi.  Both dinoflagel -
lates show phototactic responses but lack a detectable eyespot, hence the shading function is per -
formed by the cell body.
Type ii
The photoreceptor consists of a multilayered membrane structure of photoreceptive protein. The 
eyespot is outwardly concave and is located close to this structure. This type of photoreceptive sys -
tem is present in Ochrophyta and Euglenophyceae.
In Ochrophyta, complex photoreceptors, consisting of layered electron-dense material organized 
in a rounded, wedge-shaped or T-shaped organelle are present inside the smooth flagellum of the 
motile stages of Xanthophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae, and Phaeophyceae. In the Xanthophyceae, the 
eyespot consists of a single layer of about 40 globules located at one side of the anterior end of the 
chloroplast. It is contained by the outermost thylakoid of the chloroplast, bounded by the chloroplast 
envelope and its associated endoplasmic reticulum. The cell membrane above the eyespot forms a 
depression through which the posterior smooth flagellum passes. The eyespot depression accom -
modates the photoreceptor. In the Eustigmatophyceae, the prominent eyespot occupies nearly the 
whole anterior part of the cell, adjacent to the flagellar insertion. It consists of a somewhat irregular 
collection of globules situated in a slight bulge of the zoospore, but not enclosed by a membrane. 
The anterior hairy flagellum bears a photoreceptor swelling which fits alongside the eyespot. In 
the Phaeophyceae, the eyespot is situated in the posterior part of the cell, inside a strongly reduced 
chloroplast, and behind a depression of the cell surface through which the posterior flagellum runs. 
The eyespot appears concave in shape and prominent, containing a single layer of about 60 globules. 
The photoreceptor swelling is localized at level of the eyespot.
An example of Chrysophyceae photoreceptor can be found in Ochromonas danica : the eyespot 
located at the anterior end of the cell consists of a single layer of carotenoid globules contained by 
the outermost thylakoid of the chloroplast. The cell membrane above the eyespot forms a slight 
invagination; this depression accommodates the photoreceptor consisting of a 3D assemblage of 
proteins located inside the base of the smooth flagellum (Figure 2.71).
FIGURE 2.71  TEM image of the photoreceptive system of O. danica  in longitudinal section, showing the 
photoreceptor inside the trailing flagellum. Scale bar, 0.30 μm.109 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCIn the members of the Euglenophyceae, the eyespot consists of a loose collection of globules 
situated on the dorsal side of the reservoir, the anterior invagination characteristic of these organ -
isms. The globules vary in size (from 240 to 1200 nm) and number, can lie in a single layer, or be 
bunched together. Individual globules may be membrane-bound, but there is never a membrane 
surrounding the whole complex, and no association with any chloroplast component is present. 
The position of the eyespot within the reservoir region can vary among the species, but it is 
always in front of the photoreceptor situated on the long or emergent flagellum (Figure 2.72). As 
example, the photoreceptor of Euglena gracilis  will be described. This organelle is a 3D ordered 
assemblage of stacked membranes formed by 2D crystals of photoreceptive proteins. The organ -
elle is located inside the membrane of the locomotory flagellum, connected to its axoneme by the 
paraxial rod. Figure 2.73a shows a portion of the photoreceptor at high magnification: the ordered 
disposition of the membrane layers is evident, made easily recognizable by osmium tetroxide 
staining of the phospholipid head groups. The periodicity is about 50 Å comparable to the dis -
tance between the hydrophilic head layers of a typical membrane bilayer. About 50 membrane 
layers are present in the photoreceptor. Electron micrograph of a negatively stained 2D lamel -
lae, obtained by ionically induced uncoupling of the 3D compact structure of the photoreceptor, 
reveals stain excluding units protruding from the surface of the layer, arranged into a regular 
mesh (Figure 2.73b). After Fourier analysis, this mesh shows the ordered patches formed by the 
oligomers of the photoreceptive membrane spanning protein assembled in a hexagonal lattice as 
visible in the gray scale contour plot (Figure 2.73c), which is a magnification of the central zone 
of Figure 2.73b. The membrane layers composing the photoreceptor are characterized by in-plane 
hydrophobic interactions, while their closely stacked disposition is due to the interlayer interac -
tions between charged protein extramembrane domains and the membrane in adjacent layers 
through charge density matching. About 106 photoreceptive proteins assembled in a hexagonal 
lattice span the membrane layers. Because of these characteristics, the photoreceptor of Euglena  
as a whole can be defined a “Type I” crystal, that is, an ordered assemblage of stacked mem -
branes formed by 2D crystals of membrane proteins. The Euglena  photoreceptor structure is an 
example of a perfect device to absorb light with a maximal cross-section (inset in Figure 2.73a). 
Figure 2.74 shows the isolated Euglena  photoreceptor–PFR complex.
Type iii
This organization is present only in some dinoflagellates of the order Warnowiales, such as 
Nematopsides  sp. and Erytropsidinium  sp. The photoreceptor system is very specialized and is

refractile structure termed hyalosome, thought to act as a lens, subtended by a domed pigmented 
part, divided into two sections, a retinoid and a pigmented cup. Between the lens and the retinoid is 
a chamber representing an invagination of the cell covering, which is lined by the cell membrane,

ular layer. Small droplets contain carotenoid pigments, whereas large droplets contain melanoid 
pigments. The retinoid is an extremely complex membranous construction made up of numerous 
regularly arranged layers giving an almost paracrystalline appearance.
No data are available on the structure and localization of the photoreceptive system in the divi -
sions and classes of algae other than those listed above. It seems unlikely that Type II and III sys -
tems have not been identified so far in other algal groups, although it is more reasonable to assume 
that this lack of information is mainly due to the difficulty to reveal photoreceptor systems belong -
ing to Type I. We can conclude that those algae should possess photoreceptor systems that can be 
taken back to Type I.
phoTorecep TiVe proTeins
Over the past 10 years, genome sequencing and sequence comparison tools have revealed that 
genes encoding rhodopsin-like photoreceptive proteins are shared among distant taxa, in all three 
domains of life: Archaea, Eubacteria, and Eukarya. As far as algal world is concerned, reports from 
different research groups worldwide have provided examples of the broad distribution of Type I 
rhodopsin-based photoreceptors among the different algal division and allowed the assumption that 
these proteins are present in all the algae of the supergroups of Plantae (Glaucophyta, Rhodophyta, 
Chlorophyta) and Chromoalveolata (Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, Ochrophyta, and Dinophyceae), that 
is, those originating from a primary symbiotic event, and those originating from a secondary or ter -
tiary symbiotic event. In fact, genes encoding functional rhodopsins probably related to photorecep -
tion or ionic transport have been detected in Cyanophyceae (prokaryotic algae), and Cryptophyceae, 
Glaucophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Dasycladophyceae, Mesostygmatophyceae, Mamiellophyceae, 
prasinophytes, Trebouxiophyceae, Coccolithophyceae, and Dinophyceae, all eukaryotic algae. The 
presence of an integral membrane protein in the membrane of the muroplast of Cyanophora para -
doxa , a glaucophyte, the most primitive of all plastids, could indicate that the common primordial 
rhodopsin existed in preeukaryotic cells before the appearance of the first photosynthetic eukary -
otic cell about 1.55  ×  109 years ago (Figure 2.75). Moreover, spectroscopical and biochemical evi -
dence of rhodopsin-based photoreceptor is available for algae belonging also to Euglenophyceae, 
Chrysophyceae, and Phaeophyceae.
All rhodopsins consist of a proteic part, the opsin, organized in seven transmembrane 
α-helices, and a light absorbing group, the retinal (i.e., the chromophore). The retinal is located 
inside a pocket of the opsin, approximately at its center. These proteins can be considered special 
for many reasons. First, retinal–opsin complex has an intense absorption band whose maximum 
can be shifted to the visible region of the spectrum, over the entire range from 380 to 640 nm. 
Second, light isomerizes the retinal inside the protein very efficiently and rapidly. This one-
molecule isomerization, that is, the event initiating the vision reaction cascade, can be triggered 
almost exclusively by light. In the dark, it occurs about only once in a thousand years. Third, 
remarkable structural changes (movements of single α-helix) are produced by isomerization of 
retinal. Light is converted into atomic motion of sufficient magnitude to trigger a signal reliably 
and reproducibly. Fourth, the photocycle (the photoreceptive protein upon light excitation under -
goes a series of conformational changes that can be driven back to the original conformational 
state) is very fast, and hence the intracellular photoreceptive machinery is immediately reset for 
a new response. Fifth, retinal is derived from β-carotene, a precursor with a widespread biologi -
cal distribution.
FUndamen Tal behaVioral and physiological  FeaTUres
The structural features described above should be accompanied by necessary behavioral and physi -
ological characteristics (sampling strategies, trajectory control, and signal transmission).112 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCSampling Strategies
To determine the orientation of a stimulus field, an organism has to measure the stimulus intensity at 
different positions, that is, it should detect either spatial or temporal patterns of light. Femtoplankton 
(0.02–0.2  μm) is too small compared to the wavelength of light to create differential light intensity; 
hence, it cannot determine the direction of a light source. Still, femtoplankton microorganisms can 
use light, but can only measure its intensity and move in a light-intensity gradient. In contrast, phy -
toplankton dimensions are large enough to determine light direction and allow the scanning of the 
environment by means of their directionally sensitive receptor.
Two fundamental and alternative strategies exist for obtaining information on light direction: par -
allel sampling and sequential sampling. In parallel sampling, the stimulus is detected by multiple 
separated receptors positioned on different parts of the organism surface. In this case, the organism 
measures directly the spatial gradient by simultaneous comparison of light intensities at two differ -
ent parts of its body (one instant mechanism). This strategy is present in the zygote of the brown alga 
Silvetia compressa ; the photoreceptive system of the zygote is presumably the same as the egg before 
fertilization. The zygote absorbs or scatters more than 95% of the effective blue wavelengths within 
one cell diameter, thus creating a steep light gradient across the cells. Photoreceptors in or near the 
plasma membrane are activated differentially, and the cellular response to this gradient of photorecep -
tor activation is to organize an axis and germinate from the darkest point. Photopolarization is an early 
event, which has been observed 4 h after fertilization. The zygote produces a rhizoidal bulge at about 
10 h after fertilization. Initially, any point on the cell surface is capable of becoming the germination 
site. The bulge elongates by tip growth (i.e., addition of new cell membrane and wall material by 
localized vesicle secretion), and about 18 h after fertilization the first cell division occurs. The plane 
of division is perpendicular to the growth axis, resulting in the formation of two highly asymmetrical 
cells with different developmental fates. The cell bearing the bulge will form the rhizoid, which will 
show negative phototaxis, while the other cell will form the thallus. Figure 2.76 shows the first steps 
of development of a Silvetia  zygote from fertilization to rhizoid formation: changing of light direction 
causes a change in the rhizoid growth axis.
FIGURE 2.75  Immunofluorescence localization of the rhodopsin-like protein in Cyanophora paradoxa  
muroplasts. Scale bar, 5 μm.113 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCIn sequential sampling, the stimulus is detected by a single receptor as the cell changes its position 
in relation to the light source. In this situation, the organism measures directly a temporal gradient and 
then infers the spatial gradient from the information on the movements of the receptor (two-instant 
mechanism). This strategy is present in all the algae with a single photoreceptor. These algae have only 
a limited vision of the 3D world in which they navigate and cannot detect light directions by measur -
ing light intensity at two different positions in the cell body. An example is Leptolyngbya  sp., whose 
photoreceptor system has been described above. This cyanobacterium characterized by quite inflex -
ible trichomes uses light to grow toward optimal light intensities, with a sort of oriented movement 
with respect to the stimulus direction. It changes the direction of the trichome by turning towards the 
light source at the level of the apical cell (Figure 2.77a and b), where both the photoreceptor and the 
eyespot are located (Figure 2.2). When the photoreceptor system is impaired, the movement becomes 
unguided and the trichomes appear disordered (Figure 2.77c). The simultaneous comparison of signals 
requires widely spaced receptors to detect intensity gradient, which makes large body size advanta -
geous. On the other hand, sequential sampling requires a coherent pattern of movement. Many algae 
perform sequential sampling by swimming on helical paths along which their photoreceptor acts as a 
light antenna continuously searching space for bright spots. Sequential sampling also requires some 
form of memory to allow the comparison with previously recorded intensities.
Trajectory Control
Another fundamental distinction is based on whether an organism is able to make turns in its motion 
path, which will direct it toward its destination. Depending on the characteristic of the stimulus and

ing off Light 1. Scale bar, 60 mm.114 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthe abilities of the microorganism, guiding may be either direct in the sense of taking a straight-line 
path to the destination or indirect, as in the case of a biased random walk, to reach the vicinity of the 
destination. Trajectory control characteristics, and thus behavioral peculiarities, are connected with 
both the shape of the cell and the functioning of the propelling structure of the algae, that is, the 
flagellum. If the cell is asymmetric, that is, if it possesses recognizable dorsal and ventral sides, then 
it advances spinning along its axis. It can correct its trajectory by either sudden steering obtained by 
changing the insertion angle of flagella, as, for example, Ochromonas danica , or stiffening of the 
flagellum via accessory structure of the axoneme, as Euglena gracilis . This behavior can be attrib -
uted to all heterokont and uniflagellate algae. In the case of a symmetric cell, it can accomplish a 
gradual smooth correction of its trajectory going forward without spinning (or rotating with a very 
long period) and displacing the barycenter of the motor couple, as Dunaliella salina . This behavior 
can be attributed to all isokont cells.
Signal Transmission
Signal transmission in algae is still a poorly investigated topic. Algae are aneural organisms, lacking 
any system for the transmission of the stimuli received from the outside. The information carried 
by light has to be translated into an organism-specific swimming control mechanism that allows 
orientation to the light with high fidelity. Hence, the light signal will be first transduced in an elec -
tric signal by means of electron or ion flux, and this electric signal will be transmitted to the algae 
motor apparatus, that is, the flagellum/flagella. It has been demonstrated that in Chlamydomonas 
reinhardtii , light absorbed by sensory rhodopsins initiates local photocurrents (a fast photocurrent 
and a slow photocurrent) in the eyespot region, presumably in the plasma membrane right above the 
eyespot, where the photosensitive proteins are located. At low intensities, sensory rhodopsins trig -
ger a highly efficient biochemical amplification reaction which involves activation of yet unknown 
downstream elements and control of some diffusible messenger, a process analogous to vision in 
animals. At high light intensities, the second function of sensory rhodopsins, namely direct channel 
activity, begins to contribute to depolarization of the plasma membrane, which eventually allows 
motility responses. Biphasic photocurrents have been shown to exist also in other algae, such as 
Volvox carteri  (Chlorophyta) and Cryptomonas  sp. (Cryptophyta).
an example : phoTorecep Tor and phoTorecep Tion in EuglEna
As we have described in the previous section, in order for phototaxis (photoreception) to occur, 
proper perceiving devices (structural features) satisfying essential requirements are necessary 
together with specific behavioral and physiological features. In this section, we will use Euglena  
as an example to analyze how these structural, behavioral, and physiological aspects combine to 
achieve a concerted response to light stimuli. Euglena  dwells in natural shallow ponds and uses 
sunlight as source of energy and information. Its chloroplasts are the energy-supplying devices, 
whereas the simple but sophisticated photoreceptive system already described is used as a light 
detector.
The photoreceptor ciliary line of evolution, which had its climax in the elaborate and remarkably 
complex vertebrate eye, originated from the photoreceptor of Euglena . According to the definition 
of the Swiss genetist Walter Gehring, the prototypical eye, which was presumably the common 
ancestor of all eyes, is a combination of a photoreceptor cell and a pigment cell, which achieves 
some directional selectivity by using screening pigment to block light coming from certain direc -
tions. The photoreceptor cell is located close to the effector and transmits the information conveyed 
by the light directly to it (without an intervening information-processing organelle). In the case of 
Euglena , the “eye” is formed within a single cell by the assembly of pigmented and photoreceptive 
molecules within that cell in two distinct organelles, namely the eyespot and the photoreceptor. In 
the following, we will describe and analyze the different components of this primitive eye to dem -
onstrate how its simple design fits Gehring’s definition.115 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCAs already said, the eyespot consists of a loose collection of globules situated on the dorsal side 
of the reservoir, always in front of the photoreceptor. The pigments present in the eyespot globules 
are carotenoids such as β-carotene, diatoxanthin, and diadinoxanthin. The absorption spectrum of 
the eyespot shows a unique and large band centered at 460 nm (Figure 2.78, orange line).
Euglena  photoreceptor is located near the base of the locomotory flagellum. Its regular struc -
ture has already been described as “Type I” crystal, that is, an ordered assemblage of stacked 
membranes formed by 2D crystals of membrane proteins (Figure 2.73a). The spectral properties 
of this photoreceptor are quite more complex than those of the eyespot and support the presence of 
rhodopsin-like proteins. These proteins are characterized by optical bistability, that is, they possess 
two isomeric forms A and B, which interconvert along a photocycling path photochemically but not 
thermically. The absorption spectrum of A has a band centered at 498 nm (from now addressed as 
A498) (Figure 2.78, green line); this is the dominant form in the photoreceptor under physiological 
conditions. The absorption spectrum of B has a band centered at 462 nm (from now addressed as 
B462) (Figure 2.78, blue line). The absorption spectrum of the eyespot perfectly matches the absorp -
tion spectrum of the B462 form (Figure 2.78, orange line). A498 is the nonfluorescent form (hence, 
under physiological conditions, photoreceptor fluorescence is not observed), while B462 is the fluo -
rescent form, energetically lower, which can be considered the signaling state of the protein. The 
presence of optically bistable proteins characterized by a fluorescent form is a common feature of 
euglenoid photoreceptors. Figure 2.79 shows the photocycle recorded on a single cell of Euglena , 
Phacus , and Trachelomonas . Optical bistability has recently been detected also in Chlamydomonas  
rhodopsin, indicating that this could be a property of the photoreceptive protein present in the algae.
The functioning of Euglena  photoreceptor in nature can be described as in the following: the 
cells normally swim by rotating along a helicoidally path; during this motion, the photoreceptor 
proteins are in a photodynamic equilibrium in which A498 is the dominant isomer. The equilibrium 
is interrupted when the eyespot comes between the incoming light and the photoreceptor, thus 
screening the organelle (Figure 2.80). Owing to the superimposition of the absorption spectra of 
the eyespot and the isomer form B462, only UV and green light illuminate the photoreceptor during 
the screening period, and the only possible transition is that of A498 to B462. In detail, the photoi -
somerizable isomeric form A498 undergoes an intramolecular photoswitch, that is, A498 becomes 
B462 through an excited state, and contemporaneously an intermolecular and unidirectional Forster-
type energy transfer (FRET) occurs, that is, the newly formed fluorescent B462 acts as an energy 
donor for the nearby protein in the A498 form, which acts as an energy acceptor. The intramolecular

closely packed proteins in the layer(s) of the crystal structure of the photoreceptor (Figure 2.73), 
modulating the isomeric composition of the photoreceptive protein pool. As a consequence, B462, 
the signaling state of the protein energetically lower than A498, becomes the dominant isomer. It is 
worthwhile to highlight that the photoreceptive protein switches from a photoisomerizable device 
to a fluorescent dye.
The energy needed for the transition of the isomeric form A498 to B462 and the energy transferred 
from one protein to the nearby protein derives not only from the photons absorbed during the pho -
toreceptor screening by the eyespot, but also from the photons absorbed by the photoreceptor in the 
no-screening period. These photons restore the photoreceptor isomeric composition with A498 as 
dominant isomer. Once the screening by the eyespot is over, the transition of B462 to A498 can again 
occur due to the full spectrum light (natural light) impinging on the photoreceptor, and the isomeric 
composition with A498 as dominant isomer is again restored.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCAs described above, changes in the motion trajectory by bending of the locomotory flagellum 
are due to the screening of the photoreceptor by the eyespot that changes the electrostatic field. The 
locomotory flagellum carries the paraxial rod (PAR; Figure 2.36a and b), a hollow rod-like structure 
with a diameter of 90 nm along the entire length. The PAR is the true effector. When the photorecep -
tor is screened by the eyespot, the signaling state of the protein becomes the dominant isomer and a 
change in the electrostatic field occurs. Since the photoreceptor and the paraxial rod are a structural 
unit (Figure 2.74), we can hypothesize that the photoelectric signal could be propagated through the 
paraxial rod filaments via charge transfer between rod proteins, modifying the pitch of its helix, which 
in turn modifies the distribution of the mass of the rod along the axoneme. This leads to a change in 
the motion wave running along the flagellum and eventually to a change in the swimming direction.
Chloroplasts
The photosynthetic compartment contains the pigments for absorbing light and channeling the 
energy of the excited pigment molecules into a series of photochemical and enzymatic reactions. 
These pigments are organized in proteic complexes embedded in the membrane of sac-like flat 
compressed vesicles known as the thylakoids. These vesicles are about 24-nm thick and enclose a 
space, termed lumen, 10-nm wide.
In prokaryotes, the thylakoids are free within the cytoplasm, whereas in eukaryotes they are 
enclosed within bounding membranes to form the chloroplast. The colorless matrix of the chlo -
roplast is known as the stroma. Inside the chloroplast, thylakoids are organized into two different 
compartments, granal thylakoids, stacked into hollow disks termed grana, and stromal thylakoids 
forming multiple connections between the grana. All thylakoids surfaces run parallel to the plane 
of the maximum chloroplast cross-section. Chloroplasts contain nucleic acids and ribosomes. DNA 
is naked, that is, not associated with proteins, and occurs in two configurations: scattered, but not 
connected small nucleoids or as a peripheral ring. Chloroplasts are semiautonomous organelles that 
replicate their own DNA, and this replication is not linked to the division of the organelle. Synthesis 
of RNA and proteins is possible inside the chloroplast, though they are not strictly autonomous 
from the nuclear genome. The plastid genes are transcribed and translated within the plastids. The 
machinery of protein synthesis is, in any case, partially composed of imported nuclear gene prod -
ucts. In this respect, as in others, the chloroplast is no longer independent. Nevertheless, about 
half of the plastid genome consists of genes that contribute to the machine of gene expression, for 
example, genes for rRNA, tRNAs, RNA polymerase subunits, and ribosomal proteins. Plastids code 
for, and synthesize some proteins that are components for photosystems, and particular subunits 
of photosynthetic enzymes. The missing subunits of these complexes are coded in the nucleus and 
must be imported from the cytoplasm.
Chloroplast development and division (self-replication) may be coordinated with that of the cell 
or may proceed independently. They divide in mother cells and are inherited by daughter cells dur -
ing vegetative division and usually only from the maternal side in sexual reproduction. The shape 
and the number of chloroplasts are extremely variable from the single cup-shaped chloroplast of 
Dunaliella salina , the ribbon-like chloroplast of Spirogyra , or stellate one of Zygnema  to the numer -
ous (about 108) ellipsoidal chloroplasts of Acetabularia  giant cells.
The fact that algae of different divisions have different colors, due to the presence in the pho -
tosynthetic membrane system of a variety of pigments, might lead to the supposition that the pho -
tosynthetic membrane structures are variable. This is true since the features of photosynthetic 
membrane system represent a diagnostic important element at the class level. In this chapter, we 
will consider the structure, composition, and location of the photosynthetic membrane system in 
each algal division.
Cyanobacteria
The photosynthetic apparatus of these algae is localized on intracytoplasmic membranes termed 
thylakoids. The thylakoid membranes show considerable variations in structure and arrangements 119 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCdepending on the species. The amount of thylakoid membranes per cell is also a variable due to their 
growth conditions and taxonomic specificity.
In most species, the thylakoids are arranged peripherally in 3–6 layers running parallel to the 
cell membrane, forming an anastomosing network of concentric shells. This peripheral region has 
been called chromatoplast, which is separated from the inner nucleoplasmic region called centro -
plasm. This type of thylakoid arrangement is characteristic of many unicellular and filamentous 
cyanobacteria, such as Synechococeus planctibus , and Anabaena  sp. In some other organisms such 
as Oscillatoria  and Arthrospira , the thylakoids are oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal cell 
wall. Radial arrangement is present in Phormidium retzi . Thylakoids are not always restricted to the 
cell periphery but can be found scattered throughout the cell as in Gloeotrichia  sp. However, the 
arrangement of thylakoids can change from cell to cell and cell type (vegetative cells, heterocyst, 
akinete) within the same culture from parallel to a convoluted appearance. Thylakoids can fuse with 
each other and form an anastomosing network; unlike the chloroplasts of eukaryotic algae, the thy -
lakoids of cyanobacteria form stacking regions only to a very limited extent. During cell division, 
the thylakoids have to be separated and divided into the daughter cells; generally, this division is an 
active process. Cell division starts by a centripetal growth of cytoplasmic membrane and peptido -
glycan layer, to form the septum; the thylakoid cylinder is narrowed at the level of the cross-wall by 
invagination before the septum is formed. Proteins, lipids, carotenoids, and chlorophyll a are major 
components of thylakoids. On the outer surface of the thylakoids, regular rows of electron-dense 
granular structures are closely attached. These granules termed phycobilisomes, contain the light-
harvesting phycobiliproteins, that is, allophycocyanin, phycocyanin, and phycoerythrin (Figure 
2.81). The phycobilisome structure consists of a three-cylinder core of four stacked molecules of 
allophycocyanin, closest to the thylakoid membrane, on which rod-shaped assemblies of coaxially 
stacked hexameric molecules of only phycocyanin or both phycocyanin and phycoerythrin converge

Glaucophyta, Cryptophyta, and Rhodophyta.
The thylakoid membranes of Prochloron  are organized into stacked and unstacked regions remi -
niscent of the grana and stromal lamellae of higher plant chloroplasts. They differ from other cyano -
bacteria in that they contain chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting systems rather than phycobiliproteins 
organized in the phycobilisomes.
Glaucophyta
As already described in Chapter 1, these algae possess inclusion termed cyanelles that are prob -
ably symbiotic cyanobacteria functioning as chloroplasts (Figure 2.83). Each cyanelle, sur -
rounded by a reduced peptoglycan cell wall (except in Glaucosphaera  sp.), is enclosed in a 
vesicle of the host cytoplasm. Cyanelles do not fix molecular nitrogen in contrast with cyano -
bacteria; they contain polyphospate granules and a conspicuous central carboxisome similar 
to the pyrenoids of other algae. The thylakoids are not stacked but they are single and equidis -
tant with a concentric arrangement. Cyanelle pigments are chlorophyll a and β-carotene, which 
represents the main carotenoid. Interthylakoidal phycobilisomes contain allophycocyanin and 
phycocianin. Phycoerythrin is absent from Glaucophyta but phycoerythrocyanin can be found 
in some species.

Ultrastructurally, red algal chloroplasts are composed of a double-membraned envelope inside of 
which are one or more parallel, thylakoidal photosynthetic lamellae. These chloroplasts are not 
associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, a feature shared with Glaucophyta and Chlorophyta. 
Encircling thylakoids are present in all Florideophyceae, and in some taxa of Bangiophyceae while 
the thylakoids in the other red algae are equidistant and single, that is, not stacked, unlike any 
other group of eukaryotic algae (except Glaucophyta), and typically oriented parallel to each other. 
All thylakoids have phycobilisomes attached to their stromal surface, which contain the accessory 
phycobiliprotein pigments, that is, allophycocianin, phycocyanin, and five forms of phycoerythrin 
(Figure 2.84). Chlorophyll a is the only chlorophyll present in the thylakoid membrane, together 
with carotenoids such as β-carotene and lutein. Plastid number, shape, and position (many, discoid, 
and parietal) are rather uniform throughout the Florideophyceae, and pyrenoids may or may not be 
present. A single stellate plastid with a central pyrenoid is commonly associated with porphyrid -
iophyceans, such as Porphyridium  (Figure 2.85). DNA is organized into numerous nucleoids scat -
tered throughout the chloroplast.
Chlorophyta—Charophyta
These algae are not uniform in the ultrastructure of chloroplast, still some generalization can be 
made. The chloroplasts of these algae are enclosed only by the double membrane of the chloroplast 
envelope; there is no additional envelope of endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear membrane. In this 
respect, they resemble Rhodophyta and Glaucophyta in the cell compartmentalization. The chloro -
plasts vary greatly in shape and size. In unicellular forms, the chloroplast is often cup-shaped with a 
thick base ( Dunaliella ); in filamentous forms, it is often ring- or net-shaped and lies against the cell 
FIGURE 2.84  TEM image of rhodophyte thylakoid showing regularly arranged phycobilisomes. Scale bar,

FIGURE 2.85 Porphyridium cruentum  cells with a single stellate plastid. Scale bar, 1 μm.122 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCwall ( Oedogonium ). More massive and elaborate plastids, lying along the longitudinal axis of the 
cell, are particularly characteristic of members of the Zygnematophyceae. Thylakoids are arranged 
in stacks of 2–6 or more; their multilayered arrangement may take on the appearance of grana with 
membrane interconnections, as in higher plants. Girdle lamellae are absent. One to several pyrenoids 
occur in most of the algae of this division embedded within the chloroplast and are often pene -
trated by thylakoids. The DNA organized in small nucleoids is distributed throughout the chloroplast 
matrix. Both chlorophyll a and b are present; accessory pigments include different xanthophylls such 
as lutein, zeaxantin, and violaxantin; β-carotene is always present together with other carotenoids.
Haptophyta
Cells of Haptophyceae species normally possess one or two chloroplasts containing thylakoids 
stacked in three to form lamellae. There is no girdle lamella. Spindle-shaped pyrenoids are com -
monly immersed within the chloroplast, penetrated by one or a few pairs of thylakoids, but in some 
genera they bulge from the inner face of the organelle. Both the chloroplast and the pyrenoid are sur -
rounded by endoplasmic reticulum confluent with the nuclear envelope, the nucleus itself lying close 
to the chloroplast. Chlorophylls a, c1, c2 and in some genera also c3 are found in the thylakoidal mem -
branes together with carotenes, such as β-carotene, and xanthophylls, the most commonly occurring 
being fucoxanthin. DNA is organized into numerous nucleoids scattered throughout the chloroplast.
Cryptophyta
The chloroplasts of these algae, which are one or two per cell, are unusual in both their pigment 
composition and ultrastructure. Four membranes enclose these organelles: the inner pair forms the 
plastid envelope and the outer pair forms the plastid endoplasmic reticulum. This four-membrane 
configuration is common in chlorophyll c-containing algae. An expanded space is present between 
the plastid endoplasmic reticulum and the plastid envelope on its inward face. This compartment 
contains 80S ribosomes, starch grains, and the nucleomorph. Thylakoids inside the chloroplast 
are typically in pairs, although single thylakoids as well as large stacks have also been observed, 
with no girdle lamella. A pyrenoid is present, projecting from the inner side of the chloroplast. 
Cryptomonads are characterized by the presence of chlorophylls a and c2, phycoerythrin, phyco -
cyanin, allophycocyanin, carotenes, and several xanthophylls.
The phycobiliproteins differ from those in the red algae and cyanobacteria, since they are of 
lower molecular weight and do not aggregate to form discrete phycobilisomes, being localized 
within the lumen of the thylakoids. DNA is organized into numerous nucleoids scattered through -
out the chloroplast.
Ochrophyta
Some ultrastructural features of the chloroplast compartments of these algae are common to all 
the 18 classes of the division, with few exceptions. Four membranes surround the chloroplasts, the 
outer two being the chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum, and the inner two being the chloroplast 
envelope. When the chloroplasts are located close to the nucleus, the chloroplast endoplasmic retic -
ulum is continuous with the nuclear envelope. In the Xanthophyceae, this connection is not the rule. 
Thylakoids are grouped into lamellae of three, which are two in some Raphidophyceae, with vary -
ing degrees of coherence depending on the species. Thylakoids from adjacent lamellae frequently 
interconnect across the stroma. In all the classes, with the exception of Eustigmatophyceae and 
Chattonella  (Raphidophyceae), one lamella runs around the periphery of the chloroplast beneath 
the chloroplast envelope, enclosing all the other lamellae. The lamella is called girdle lamella.
One or more plate-like (Chrysophyceae, Figure 2.86a and b; Eustigmatophyceae, Figure 2.87a and 
b), discoid (Xanthophyceae, Raphidophyceae, Dictyochophyceae), or ribbon-like (Phaeophyceae) 
plastids are typically present, often lobed, parietal, or located in close connection with the nucleus. 
In the Bacillariophyceae, chloroplasts are the most conspicuous feature, and their number and shape 
are consistent features of taxonomic importance. They may be rounded or lobed discs or large 123 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCplate-like with or without lobed margins and may range from one to two, four, or more. A typical 
centric diatom has many disc-shaped plastids, arranged close to the periphery surrounding a large 
central vacuole or scattered throughout the cell. The raphid diatoms tend to have large chloroplasts 
(1–4) lying along the girdle with central nucleus flanked by two large vacuoles.
The chloroplast DNA is ring-shaped and located in the region between the girdle lamella and the 
others in all the classes, with the exception of the Eustigmatophyceae, where it is organized into many 
dot-like nucleoids, which may be united in a sort of reticulum. The main photosynthetic pigment is 
chlorophyll a, which is the only chlorophyll present in the Eustigmatophyceae, Aurearenophyceae 
and Ochromonas (Chrysophyceae). In addition, chlorophylls of the c group occur, both c1 and 
c2 (Chrysophyceae, Rhaphidophyceae, Phaeophyceae, Dictyocophyceae and only in extremely 
low concentrations in Xanthophyceae); only c1 (synurophyceae), or only c2 (Bacillariophyceae). 
The most important accessory pigment is fucoxanthin in Chrysophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, 
Dictyocophyceae, and Phaeophyceae; violaxanthin in Eustigmatophyceae, and vaucheriaxanthin in 
Xanthophyceae. Other accessory pigments are β-carotene and xanthophylls such as diadinoxanthin, 
heteroxanthin, vaucheriaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and lutein. In the Raphidophyceae, marine and

fucoxanthin, and violaxanthin, and freshwater species having β-carotene, diadinoxanthin, hetero -
xanthin, and vaucheriaxanthin.
Pyrenoids are present in all the classes, except in the zoospores of the Eustigmatophyceae, and in 
the freshwater species of Raphidophyceae. They are of a semi-immersed type, attached to the inner 
face of the chloroplast, pear-shaped in the Phaeophyceae, or stalked in the Eustigmatophyceae. 
They can be one or many (Bacillariophyceae and Phaeophyceae). No storage material or capping 
vesicles have been found to be associated with pyrenoids, but lipid or oil droplets normally distrib -
uted randomly in the chloroplast matrix are often concentrated at the periphery of the pyrenoid.
Cercozoa –Chlorarachniophyceae
Five to seven bilobed chloroplasts are present inside these algae in a peripheral position. Each chloro -
plast is bounded by a system of membranes that may appear either as four separate membranes, as a 
pair of membranes with a sort of flattened vesicles between them, or as three membranes. Four sepa -
rate membranes are always found near the proximal end of the pyrenoid and over the pyrenoid itself. 
The outer pair of membranes, when four are present, is referred to as a type of chloroplast endoplasmic 
reticulum; however, the inner pair is interpreted as the chloroplast envelope. The thylakoids are often 
loosely stacked in three, with no girdle lamella. Each chloroplast bears a central, pear-shaped pyrenoid 
inward projecting. Around the pyrenoid, often tightly associated with it, there are vesicles containing 
β-1,3-glucan, which is the principal storage carbohydrate. A nucleomorph, which contains DNA and 
a nucleoulus-like body, is present between the second and third envelopes of each chloroplast, in a 
pocket located in the pyrenoid surface. Chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, and xanthophylls.
Mizozoa-Dinophyceae
Chloroplasts may be present or absent in these algae, depending on the nutritional regimen. When 
present, they are characterized by triple-membrane envelopes not connected with the endoplasmic 
reticulum; thylakoids are usually in a group of three, unappressed, and girdle lamellae are generally 
absent. Pyrenoids show various types, stalked, or embedded within the chloroplast. DNA is orga -
nized into numerous nodules scattered throughout the chloroplast. About 50% of the dinoflagellates 
with plastids acquired them from a variety of photosynthetic eukaryotes by endosymbiosis (cf. 
Chapter 1). Hence, the pigments other than chlorophylls a and c2 (e.g., carotenoids, xanthophylls) 
change among the different groups.
The most common chloroplast type is the peridinin-type plastid; an example is Amphidinium 
carterae , probably derived from the red lineage by secondary endosymbiosis, that is, through the 
uptake of primary plastid-containing endosymbiont. Other groups of dinoflagellates have plastids 
derived from a tertiary endosymbiotic event, that is, the uptake of a secondary plastid containing 
endosymbiont. Tertiary plastids are present in the toxic genus Dinophysis , characterized by two-
membrane, cryptophyte-derived plastids, which contain phycobilin (phycoerythrin), and alloxan -
thin, a typical cryptophyte carotenoid; in other important species such as Karenia  sp., Gyrodinium 
aureolum  and Gymnodinium galatheanum  with fucoxanthin as an accessory pigment, which pos -
sess haptophyte-derived plastids surrounded by two or four membranes; and in Kryptoperidinium  
sp. and close relatives, which have a five-membrane, diatom-derived plastid that includes a diatom 
nucleus of unknown complexity, and fucoxanthin as accessory pigment.
A serial secondary endosymbiosis (the uptake of a new primary plastid-containing endosymbi -
ont) occurred in Lepidodinium  chlorophorum and its close relatives, in which the peridinin plastid 
has apparently been replaced by a secondary plastid derived from a core chlorophyte alga contain -
ing chlorophylls a and b and surrounded by two membranes.
Noctiluca scintillans  presents a completely different plastid situation: this large and conspicuous 
dinoflagellate, common in coastal areas worldwide, has both a completely heterotrophic form and 
a green “photosynthetic” form, harboring thousands of free-swimming cells of the prasinophyte 
Pedinomonas noctilucae .125 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCIn addition to dinoflagellates with permanent plastids, there are several taxonomic groups of 
dinoflagellates having kleptoplastids (stolen plastids), which are temporary but functional plas -
tids captured from prey. Table 2.2 shows a list of possible kleptoplastidic dinoflagellates and their 
possible origin. Most of these dinoflagellates seem to prefer to retain kleptoplastids derived from 
cryptophytes. Among the most investigated cases is Gymnodinium acidotum ; this dinoflagellate is 
characterized by the temporary retention of engulfed chloroplasts of a cryptophyte endosymbiont, 
Chroomonas  spp. The exact identification of the prey was performed by microspectrophotometry. 
Figure 2.88a shows Gymnodinium acidotum  and Figure 2.88b shows its absorption spectrum of 
its chloroplast. Figures 2.88d,g, and j show three possible preys present in the same environment, 
that is Chroomonas  sp.,  an unknown cryptophyte, and Cryptomonas  sp. The absorption spectra of 
their chloroplasts are shown in Figures 2.88e,h, and k. The difference spectra calculated between 
the absorption spectrum of the dinoflagellate and the absorption spectrum of the chloroplasts of the 
three preys are shown in Figures 2.88f,i, and l. Figure 2.88c shows the control difference spectrum. 
Since the difference spectra of Figures 2.88c and f are almost identical, it can be concluded that 
Gymnodinium acidotum  preys only upon Chroomonas  sp.
Euglenozoa
As in the Dinophyta, the chloroplast envelope consists of three membranes. Chloroplasts are typically 
many per cell and show considerable diversity of size, shape, and morphology (Figure 2.89a and b).
Five main types can be recognized:
 1. Discoid chloroplasts with no pyrenoids ( Phacus ).
 2. Elongated or shield-shaped chloroplasts with a central naked pyrenoid ( Trachelomonas ).
 3. Large plated chloroplasts with the so-called double-sheeted pyrenoid, that is, a pyrenoid 
which carries a watch glass-shaped cup of paramylon on both plastid surfaces ( Euglena 
obtusa ).
 4. Plated chloroplasts having a large pyrenoid projecting from the inner surface, which is 
covered by a cylindrical or spherical cup of paramylon ( Colacium ).
 5. Chloroplast ribbons radiating from one, two, or three paramylon centers ( Eutreptia ).TABLE 2.2

are usually grouped in threes forming lamellae as in Ochrophyta and Dynophyta. Girdle lamellae 
are never found in this group. The photosynthetic pigments are chlorophylls a and b with carotenes 
and xanthophylls as accessory pigments. Chloroplast DNA occurs as tiny granules throughout the 
whole stroma.

Transcription and translation processes are accomplished by the assistance of abundant 70S ribo -
somes located in the centroplasm. These ribosomes are smaller than their counterparts in the eukary -
otic cytoplasm, but are typical of all prokaryotes, mitocondria, and chloroplasts. Cyanobacteria can 
only reproduce asexually, but appear to have some forms of genetic recombination possible, which 
are divided into two categories: transformation and conjugation. Transformation occurs when DNA 
is shed by one cell into the environment and is taken up by another cell and incorporated into its 
genome replacing homologous sections of DNA. The ability to be transformed by external DNA is 
species-specific and typically requires special environmental conditions. Conjugation is a “parasex -
ual” process in which one of the partners develops a conjugation tube that connects to the recipient 
cell. Typically a plasmid (a small circle of DNA) from the donor cell passes through the conjugation 
tube. It is thought that genes for gas vacuolation, antibiotic resistance, and toxin production are car -
ried on plasmids in cyanobacteria.
In eukaryotic algae, genetic information in the form of DNA, together with the controlling ser -
vices for its selective expression, occurs in plastids (plastome), mitochondria (chondrome), and in 
the cell nucleus (genome). In the previous section, we have described organization and behavior of 
chloroplast DNA, which are similar to those of mitochondria. It is worthwhile to recall that plastid 
and mitochondrial genes and the way in which they are expressed have much in common with the 
system of gene expression of prokaryotes, and there are many plastid genes with extended introns 
that are very rare in prokaryotes. (Genes are mosaics of introns and exons. Introns are the DNA 
sequences of unknown function that are removed in the primary mRNA transcript. Exons are the 
DNA sequences that code for amino acids.)
In the nucleus of eukaryotic algae, long, linear, and unbranched molecules of DNA are associ -
ated with proteins and small amount of RNA. Two types of proteins are found: the relatively uni -
form histones (about 20), involved in the structural organization of the DNA, and the very variable

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCproteins involved in gene activity regulation, such as DNA and RNA polymerases. The DNA–pro -
tein complex, made up of repeating units termed nucleosomes, is known as chromatin, which is 
usually highly dispersed in the interphase nucleus. During mitosis and meiosis metaphases, the 
DNA–protein complexes are more helically condensed around the nucleosome and form the chro -
mosomes, each chromosome consisting of a single DNA molecule.
The nucleus is surrounded by a two-membrane envelope continuous with the endoplasmic reticu -
lum. Between the two membranes, there is a narrow perinuclear space about 20 nm wide. The nuclear 
envelope is perforated by numerous pores 60–100 nm in diameter. Nuclear pores have a complicated 
superstructure; they are not simply free openings, but are gateways in nuclear envelope through 
which the controlled transport of macromolecules (RNA, proteins) takes place. Pores can be arranged 
in straight lines as in Bumilleria  (Xanthophyceae, Ochrophyta), in closely hexagonal groups as in 
Prorocentrum  (Dinophyceae), or can be randomly distributed as in Glenodinium  (Dinophyceae).
All algal nuclei possess nucleoli that vary in shape, size, and number in the different algal divi -
sions. Nucleoli are dense concentrations of ribonucleoprotein-rich material, which are intimately 
associated with the specific region of the chromosomal DNA coding for ribosomal RNA. Nucleoli 
can be single and central as in Cryptomonas  (Cryptophyta) or be more than 20 scattered in the 
nucleus as in Euglena acus  (Euglenophyta).
In eukaryotic algae, the features of the interphase nucleus, DNA replication, and processes of 
transcription and translation in the expression of genetic information and cytokinesis are compa -
rable to those of all the other eukaryotes. Exceptions to this rule will be described.
Rhodophyta
The basic features of mitosis and cytokinesis are the same throughout the division, though some 
variation may occur. Unlike other groups of eukaryotic algae, where the mitotic spindle is formed 
between two pairs of centrioles, one at each spindle pole, in red algae the poles of the spindle 
are marked by ring-shaped structures named polar rings. The absence of centrioles reflects the 
complete absence of flagella in the red algae. The chromosomal and interzonal microtubules do 
not converge toward the polar rings, so that the spindle poles are very broad. The nuclear enve -
lope does not break down, though it is perforated by large holes, hence the mitosis is closed. The 
spindle persists for some time at early telophase, holding daughter nuclei apart; it collapses only at 
late telophase, when daughter nuclei are kept separated by a vacuole. Cytokinesis is by furrowing, 
but is typically incomplete; the furrow impinges upon the vacuole but leaves open a cytoplasmic 
connection between sibling cells. This connection is then filled and blocked by a proteinaceous 
stopper, named pit plug. The simplest type of pit plug consists only of a proteinaceous core; two- or 
one-layered caps partly composed of polysaccharides can border the core of both sides with dif -
ferent thicknesses. A cap membrane can be present between the two layers of the cap or bounding 
the plug core.
Chlorophyta—Charophyta
Nuclear and cell divisions have been intensively and extensively studied in the green algae at light 
microscopic and ultrastructural level, and several different patterns have been recognized. Two 
basic patterns have merged from these studies regarding nuclear and cell division in green algae:
 1. Intranuclear mitosis, with the nuclear envelope closed at metaphase or open at the poles, 
interrupted by the microtubules of the spindle; other microtubules, transverse to the lon -
gitudinal axis of the spindle, are present at telophase and form the phycoplast; the latter 
functions somehow in cytokinesis, by furrowing or by cell-plate formation; the daughter 
nuclei at telophase are in close proximity.
 2. The spindle and nuclear envelope are open and a phycoplast is absent; at telophase, the 
microtubules of the intranuclear spindle are persistent and a phragmoplast-like structure is 
organized as cytokinesis proceeds by furrowing.129 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCCylindrocapsa  is an example of the first type; the parietal chloroplast divides before mitosis. 
Two pairs of centrioles are already present at the beginning of the interphase. In early prophase, the 
nuclear envelope is surrounded by one or two layers of endoplasmic reticulum, which is rough, that 
is, covered by ribosomes. Perinuclear microtubules appear around the nucleus and in late prophase 
they proliferate within the nucleus to form a tilted mitotic spindle between the pairs of centrioles 
lying at the spindle poles. At metaphase, the nuclear envelope is still intact and surrounded by the 
endoplasmic reticulum, so that mitosis is closed. The fully condensed chromosomes become aligned 
to form a distinct metaphase plate and have plate-like layered kinetochores. The nonpersistent telo -
phase spindle soon degenerates, though a few microtubules can still be found around the re-formed 
nuclear envelopes. The pairs of centrioles migrate around the telophase nuclei, away from the former 
spindle poles, and toward the center of the equatorial plane, where they remain until after cytokine -
sis. Cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum proliferate in the narrow zone of cytoplasm present between 
the two daughter nuclei in the center of the cell. They bleb off smooth endoplasmic reticulum 
vesicles, which become aligned in the equatorial plane to form a cell plate of smooth vesicles. These 
vesicles coalesce to form a transverse system separating the daughter cells. Here, the vesicles accu -
mulate within a phycoplast, that is, a plate of microtubules lying in the future plan of division. After 
completion of the transverse septum and the resultant separation of the daughter cells, a new cell 
wall is secreted around each daughter protoplast by exocytosis of Golgi-derived vesicles containing 
wall material. Each daughter cell thus gains a complete new wall; in the case of Cylindrocapsa , 
daughter cells remain united to form filaments, since the parental walls are persistent. In the case 
of other green algae with this type of mitosis and cytokinesis, daughter cells are liberated from the 
parent cell wall as nonflagellate autospores or as zoospores with centrioles ready to form flagella.
Coleochaete  possess the second type of nuclear and cell division; the chloroplast begins to cleave at 
prophase; the single centriolar pair present during the interphase replicates at prophase and each of the 
two pairs takes up a position at one pole of the future spindle. Microtubules then form between the cent -
riolar pairs, outside the envelope of the elongate prophase nucleus. The mitosis is open, since the nuclear 
envelope breaks down during metaphase; endoplasmic reticulum vesicles are present among the spindle 
microtubules. The chromosomes align in a distinct metaphase plate but the chromosomal microtubules 
do not attach to defined kinetochores. At early telophase, daughter nuclei become separated through 
elongation of the spindle, which is persistent during telophase and holds the nuclei far apart. By the 
end of the telophase, new microtubules proliferate and surround the spindle microtubules, forming 
the phragmoplast, which also includes actin filaments. Golgi-derived vesicles appear within the 
phragmoplast, guided by the microtubules and the filaments to the future plane of division, where 
they become arranged to form a cell plate. The vesicles contain cell-wall material, and their coales -
cence produces a transverse septum consisting of two cell membranes with the new transverse wall 
between them. Since the coalescence is not complete, connections leading to plasmodesmata are left 
between the daughter cells. This type of mitosis and cytokinesis is rare in the green algae, but is the 
common mode of division in plants such as bryophytes and tracheophytes.
Cryptophyta
These algae possess a peculiar organelle termed nucleomorph located in the space between the 
chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum and the chloroplast envelope. This organelle has a double 
membrane around it, pierced by pores, and contains both DNA and a nucleolus-like structure 
where rRNA genes are transcribed. The DNA is organized in three small chromosomes encod -
ing genes for its own maintenance. It possesses the ability to self-replication, without forming a 
spindle during mitosis. It is considered a vestigial nucleus belonging to a photosynthetic eukary -
otic symbiont of red algal ancestry.
Mizozoa—Dinophyceae
The dinoflagellate nucleus, known as dinokaryon, is bounded in the usual eukaryotic fashion by a 
nuclear envelope penetrated by pores. However, it possesses a number of unusual features, including 130 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLChigh amounts of DNA per cell (5–10 times the most common eukaryotic levels, up to a maximum of 
200 pg in Gonyaulax polyedra ). It is relatively large, often occupying about one-half of the volume 
of the cell. Nuclear shapes are variable, ranging from spheroid to U-, V-, or Y-shaped configura -
tions. In most dinoflagellates, the chromosomes remain continuously condensed and visible, by 
both light and electron microscopy, during interphase and mitosis. Chromosome counts range from 
12 to around 400, but may be variable within a species. A prominent nucleolus is also persistent. 
Each chromosome consists of a tightly super-coiled structure of DNA double helix. The permanent 
condensed chromosome shows a swirled, fibrillar appearance due to the naked DNA double helices 
(i.e., no histones are present). The 3–6-nm fibrils are packed in a highly ordered state, up to six 
levels of coiling. A small amount of basic protein is present in a few species, such as O. marina , but 
none of it corresponds in amino acid content to the histones normally present in eukaryotic chro -
mosomes. A further peculiarity of dinoflagellate chromosomes is the high amount of calcium and 
other divalent metals, such as iron, nickel, or copper, which may play a role in chromosomal orga -
nization. In some dinoflagellate, such as Noctiluca  and Blastodinium , the chromosomes undergo an 
expanded, decondensed change during interphase, and are termed noctikaryotic.
Dinoflagellate mitosis is also unusual. At the time of division, chromosomes divide longitu -
dinally, the split starting at one end of the chromosome and moving along the entire length. The 
nucleus is invaded by cytoplasmic channels that pass from one pole to the other. Microtubules are 
present in these channels. The nuclear envelope and the nucleolus are persistent throughout nuclear 
division. The chromosomes upon dividing assume a V or Y configuration, and the apices of such 
chromosomes are closely associated with the nuclear envelope surrounding a cytoplasmic channel. 
This association suggests that the cytoplasmic channels serve as a mechanism for the movement of 
chromosomes.
The nuclear envelope persist during mitosis (closed mitosis), as it does in other algae, for exam -
ple, Euglenophyceae and Raphidophyceae. However, with the exception of Oxyrrhis marina , where 
mitotic spindle is intranuclear, the chromosomes do not appear fibrillar, the mitosis strongly resem -
bles that of Euglena , and the mitotic spindle is always extranuclear. The spindle microtubules pass 
through furrows and tunnels that form in the nucleus at prophase. No obvious spindle pole bod -
ies other than concentric aggregation of Golgi bodies are present. Some microtubules contact the 
nuclear envelope, lining the tunnels at points where the chromosomes also contact. The chromo -
somes have differentiated dense regions inserted into the envelope.
Dinoflagellate cells undergo binary fission, and each daughter cell can retain half the parent cell 
wall, which splits along a predetermined fission line. This mode of reproduction is called “desmos -
chisis,” and examples are Ceratium  and many Gonyaulax  species. In other dinoflagellates, daughter 
cells do not share the parent cell wall; this mode of division is called “eleutheroschisis.” Binary 
fission may take place either inside the mother cell (many freshwater Peridinium  species) or the pro -
toplast may leave the mother cell wall before division through a hole or slit. In thecate species (many 
marine Protoperidinium  species), the protoplast escapes after special thecal plates are dislocated 
through a hole. In several species, the protoplast has no flagella and deforms its cell wall during 
the escape from the mother theca; however, this is not a typical amoeboid stage. After cell division, 
each daughter cell produces a new cell wall or a new theca in thecate cells.
Euglenozoa—Euglenophyceae
In these algae, the interphase nucleus lies in the central or posterior region of the cell; it is spherical 
in most spindle-shaped species, and ovoid or long and narrow in elongate cells. In the largest spe -
cies, the nucleus is at least 30 × 15 μm in dimensions, but in small species the spherical nucleus may 
be less than 2 μm in diameter. The chromosomes retain their condensed condition throughout inter -
phase, appearing as granular or filamentous threads (Figure 2.90a and b). In some nuclei, the chro -
mosomes radiate from the central endosome, while in others (even in the same species) they coil 
haphazardly throughout the nucleoplasm. Mitosis begins with a forward migration of the nucleus 131 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCso that it comes to lie immediately posterior to the reservoir. In species with several endosomes in 
the interphase nucleus, these usually fuse to form a single body. The endosome then elongates along 
the divisions axis, perpendicular to the long axis of the cell, and the chromosomes orient into the 
metaphase position, following three main types of orientation:
 1. Pairs of chromatids from late prophase orient into a circlet of single chromatids, separation 
and segregation having occurred during orientation ( Euglena gracilis ).
 2. Pairs of chromatids from interphase and/or prophase come to lie along the division axis 
still as pairs, parallel to one another and to the elongated endosomes ( Euglena communis , 
Euglena viridis ).
 3. Single chromosomes from prophase line up along the division axis and thereby undergo 
duplication into the pairs of chromatids of that mitosis ( Euglena acus , Euglena spirogyra ).
These different types overlap to a certain extent, species differing mainly in the time at which 
the double structure of the chromosomes first becomes microscopically visible. In all cases, the 
endosome continues to elongate and the chromatids segregate toward the ends of the endosome into 
two daughter groups. This stage, with most but not quite all of the daughter chromosomes sepa -
rated, must be called metaphase in Euglena . During this early-to-late metaphase succession, the 
locomotor apparatus (flagella, photoreceptor, and eyespot) replicates and the reservoir divides. The 
daughter reservoirs open into the still single canal, but now each reservoir has its own contractile 
vacuole, eyespot, and flagella. Separation, segregation, and anaphasic movements of the chroma -
tids are irregular, and this, coupled with a very low chromatid velocity, results in an extremely 
long anaphase. The end of the anaphase is marked by a sudden flowing to the poles of the central 
region of the elongated endosome, and the persistent nuclear envelope seals around the groups of 
chromatids and the daughter endosomes to form the telophase nuclei. Once telophase is established, 
with separate daughter nuclei, one of the two flagella in each daughter reservoir grows to emerge as 
a locomotory flagellum. A cleavage line is initiated between the now distinct daughter canals and 
progress helically backward to separate the daughter cells.
High chromosome numbers are the rule for species of Euglenophyceae, indicating a possible 
polyploidy.

In this section, we will describe organelles that upon stimulation by contact, heat or chemicals dis -
charge a structure, such as a tread or a tube from the surface of the cell. These organelles may serve 
for defense purposes or as feeding adjuvant.
Chlorophyta—Charophyta
Some Pyramimonas  species (Prasinophytes) contain ejectile structures similar to the ejectosomes 
of Cryptophyta. In the undischarged state, they consist of a coiled ribbon, which upon discharge 
forms a hollow tube tapered at both ends.
Haptophyta
During its motile stage, Phaeocystis  can eject ribbon-like filaments a few tens of nanometres wide 
and several tens of micrometers long. Their interconnections form a 5-branch star-like configuration 
(Figure 2.91). The winding of the filaments inside vesicles, as well as their axial twist, are probably 
the consequences of their biosynthesis within a confined space. As a result, the filaments behave 
like spring-coils whose stored energy is released once the vesicles are broken and the filaments 
ejected. Using electron diffraction techniques, the filaments have been unambiguously character -
ized as being made of α-chitin crystals, the polymer chain axis lying along the filament direction. 
These chains are antiparallelly arranged (allomorph) and this arrangement has never been reported 
before in the algal world.
Cryptophyta
These algae possess large refractile ejectosomes, lining the oral groove, and small ejectosomes scat -
tered around the cell surface at the anterior corners of the periplast plates. An undischarged ejectosome 
FIGURE 2.91  Ejectile organelles of Phaeocystis  sp. Coiled filaments before release (a); star-like configura -
tion after release (b).133 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCis a tightly coiled, tapered ribbon that is wound with the wider end toward the outside; a smaller coil 
is attached to it and lies in the depression of the larger one. Prior to release, ejectosomes are enclosed 
within vesicles. The large ejectosomes are explosive organelles. If cryptophyte cells are irritated by 
mechanical or chemical stress, they escape the potentially lethal influences by discharging the ejecto -
somes: the cells jump backwards in fast zigzag movements through the water. When discharged, the 
ribbon unfurls, with the shorter segment forming a beak-like tip on the longer. The edges of the ribbon 
tend to curl inwards, producing circular and e-shaped profiles in cross-section (Figure 2.92).
Ochrophyta
Many species of Raphidophyceae have extrusome organelles that explode on strong stimulation 
throwing out up to 200- μm long slime threads. The material produced may surround a motile indi -
vidual with mucilage so that it becomes palmelloid.
Cercozoa–Chlorarachmophyceae
Structures interpreted as ejectile organelles (extrusomes) are commonly seen in Bigelowiella natans . 
Each organelle resides in a vesicle and consists of two parts. The anterior part is very short, mea -
suring approximately 0.15 μm in length, whereas the posterior part is approximately 0.55 μm long. 
The posterior part has a very distinct substructure, comprising a core surrounded by a less opaque 
cylinder. The cylinder is lined by a thin membrane-like structure, whereas the core comprises a thin -
ner membranous structure surrounded by a more opaque one. The structure of the anterior part of 
the ejectile organelle is less well defined. Although it is clear that the membrane of the surrounding 
vesicle forms an indentation ring that separates the two parts of the ejectile organelle, the path of the 
membrane in this area is less clear. It appears that only the core of the organelle is discharged, the 
core apparently turning inside out during discharge. The surrounding cylinder seems to remain in 
place. The fate of the anterior part of the ejectile organelle after discharge has not been ascertained 
(Figure 2.93).

The most common type of extrusomes, of almost universal occurrence in the motile phase of these 
algae, are trichocysts, that is, rod-shaped bodies that, when mature, usually lie in the amphiesma 
perpendicular to the cell membrane (Figure 2.94). The shaft is paracrystalline, proteinaceous rod 
a few micrometers in length, rectangular in cross-section. At its distal end, it extends as a group 
of twisted fibers. The whole is enclosed within a membranous sac, and there is a sheating material 
between the rod and the membrane. The tip of the sac is in contact with the cell membrane, passing 
through the amphiesmal vesicles, and the thecal plates, if present. Thrichocysts are formed in the 
vicinity of the Golgi body and move to the cell periphery. They are discharged apparently by a rapid 
FIGURE 2.93  Ejectile organelle of Bigelowiella natans  before (a) and during discharge (b).
FIGURE 2.94 Undischarged trichocyst of Goniaulax poliedra  in longitudinal and transverse sections.135 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLChydration process, the discharged structures measuring up to 200 μm in length. Their function is 
unknown, but it is assumed to be defensive, excretory, or both.
A less ordered type of extrusomes in dinoflagellates is the mucocyst, a simple sac with granular 
content, associated with the release of mucoid material. They are located just beneath the cell mem -
brane and are often aggregated in the region of the sulcus; their release in some species is correlated 
with the psamnophilous existence of these algae, facilitating the attachment of the cells to sand 
grains along the seashore.
More elaborate extrusomes termed nematocysts are found in genera such as Polykrikos kofoidii  
and Nematodinium ; usually only about 8–10 nematocysts are present per cell. These organelles 
are larger than trichocysts and can reach 20 μm in length. They are conical, fluid-filled sacs with a 
capitated blunt end. Most of the body consists of a large posterior chamber, from which a smaller 
anterior chamber is isolated; the whole structure is capped by a lid-like operculum. A sharp stylet 
in the anterior chamber is connected to a tubular filament in the posterior chamber (Figure 2.95).
Feeding structures are present in dinoflagellates, depending on the type of feeding mechanisms 
present: feeding tube (peduncle, or tentacle) and feeding veil (pallium).
Tube feeding is commonly found among both naked and thecate species of dinoflagellates (e.g., 
Dinophysis , Amphidinium , Gyrodinum , and Peridinopsis ). Cell membrane is extruded from the cell 
to form a tube, which can engulf whole cells or penetrate prey cell walls and suck in prey cytoplasm.
Pallium feeding has only been described for heterotrophic thecate species such as Protoperidinium  
and Diplopsalis . The prey is captured via a primary attachment filament; an extension of the cyto -
plasm then emerges from the region of the sulcus-cingulum, which encloses the prey as a veil (pal -
lium). Enzymatic digestion of the prey cytoplasm is brought about inside the veil, and the products 
are then transported to the predator.
Direct engulfment is mainly found among naked species (e.g., Gyrodinium , Gymnodinium , 
Noctiluca ); however, some thecate species have been shown to use this feeding mechanism as well. 
Feeding behavior in dinoflagellates involves several steps prior to actual ingestion, including pre -
capture, capture, and prey manipulation. As feeding mechanisms allow the ingestion of relatively 
large preys, or parts thereof, dinoflagellates are regarded as raptorial feeders. While prey size plays 
an important role for the ability of dinoflagellates to ingest food, this cannot alone explain prey 
FIGURE 2.95  Nematocysts of Polykrikos kofoidii.136 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCpreferences actually found. Some dinoflagellate species can be very selective in their choice of prey, 
while others show a remarkable versatility.
Euglenozoa—Euglenophyceae
Trichocysts are present only in some phagotrophic species, such as Entosiphon  and Peranema 
trichophorum . In Peranema , ejectile organelles or mucocysts are located beneath the cell sur -
face, often subtending the pellicular articulations. In transverse sections, they appear as hollow 
tubes of amorphous material, with low electron density, enclosed within a vesicle bounded by 
single membrane, often found near the Golgi apparatus; or they show a content of greater density, 
and may subtend the pellicle or protrude through it. Mucocysts subtending the pellicular articu -
lations are ejected from the cell through the grooves. They are characterized by three distinct 
regions: an inner tube 1.20-mm long and 1.18-mm wide with helical striations; an outer tube 0.77 
mm long and 0.21-mm wide with a diamond-shaped pattern; and a dense middle band 0.07 mm in 
FIGURE 2.96  Ejected mucocyst of P. trichophorum .
FIGURE 2.97  (a) Cell of Entosiphon  sp. (b) Longitudinal section of the cell, showing the structure of the 
feeding apparatus.137 Anatomy
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCwidth. Often a crown of dense fibrillar material occurs at the tips of the mucocyst. Small slime-
extruding mucus bodies are the trichocyst counterparts commonly found in the nonphagotrophs 
(Figure 2.96).
A feeding apparatus is present in many Euglenophyceae, such as Diplonema , Ploeotia , or 
Entosiphon . In the latter (Figure 2.97a), it consists of a cytostome surrounded by four centrally 
located vanes (series of plicate folds or curved ribbons) and supported by rods composed of closely 
packed microtubules. Near the base of the feeding apparatus, one of the rods split giving rise to a 
total of three stout rods that extend nearly the length of the cell. At about one-third of the distance 
down the apparatus (from the anterior end), the number of microtubules per rod increases dramati -
cally and then decreases in number toward the base giving the apparatus the overall appearance of a 
cone with one side open (Figure 2.97b). This feeding apparatus can be moved in and out, extending 
toward the anterior of the cell and then withdrawing down into the cell for a distance of 3–5 mm. 
This motion allows food to be drawn into the cell.

Photosynthesis
LIGHT
The sun is the universal source of energy in the biosphere. Due to the nuclear fusion processes 
occurring in the sun, matter is changed into energy, which can be emitted into space in the form of 
electromagnetic radiation, having both wave and particle properties. Almost all light in the natural 
environment originates from the sun. Its spectral distribution (Figure 3.1, thin black line) is similar 
to that of an efficient radiant surface known as a blackbody at a temperature of 5800 K (Figure 
3.1, thick black line) and ranges from short wavelength (10−6 nm, γ- and X-rays) to long wavelength 
(1015 nm, long radio waves) (Figure 3.2).
In passing through the atmosphere, a small portion of this light is absorbed and some is scat -
tered. Short wavelengths are strongly scattered, and ozone absorption effectively eliminates wave -
lengths <300 nm (Figure 3.1, grey line). At longer wavelengths, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and 
oxygen absorb light significantly at particular wavelengths, producing sharp dips in the spectrum. 
At still-longer wavelengths, >4000 nm, all objects in the environment become significant sources 
of radiations, depending on their temperature, and surpass sunlight in intensity. These environmen -
tal characteristics restrict the range of electromagnetic radiation. About 99% of the sun’s radiation 
that reaches the surface of the earth has a spectral range from ~300 nm (ultraviolet) to ~4000 nm 
(infrared) and is called the broadband or total solar radiation. Almost superimposable on the broad -
band radiation three spectral regions exist, which can be associated with specific phenomena, such 
as harmful and potentially mutagen ultraviolet radiation (UV, 100–400 nm), sight (visible light, 
400–700 nm), and heat (infrared radiation, 700–4000 nm) (Figure 3.2).
Ultraviolet light is arbitrarily broken down into three bands, according to its anecdotal effects. 
UV-A (315–400 nm) is the least harmful and the most commonly found type of UV light, because 
it has the least energy. UV-A light is often called black light and is used for its relative harmless -
ness and its ability to cause fluorescent materials to emit visible light, thus appearing to glow in 
the dark. Most phototherapy and tanning booths use UV-A lamps. UV-B (280–315 nm) is typically 
the most destructive form of UV light, because it has enough energy to damage biological tissues, 
yet not quite enough to be completely absorbed by the atmosphere. UV-B is known to cause skin 
cancer. Since most of the extraterrestrial UV-B light is blocked by the atmosphere, a small change 
in the ozone layer could dramatically increase the danger of skin cancer. Short-wavelength UV-C 
(200–280 nm) is almost completely absorbed in air within a few hundred meters. When UV-C pho -
tons collide with oxygen molecules, the O–O bond is broken and the released O atom reacts with 
O2 molecule (and for energetic reasons with a collision partner M) and forms ozone (O3). UV-C 
is almost never observed in nature, since it is absorbed very quickly. Germicidal UV-C lamps are 
often used to purify air and water, because of their ability to kill bacteria.
The visible range extends from 400 to 700 nm, and these wavelengths are utilized for both vision 
and photosynthesis. The radiation utilized by oxygenic photosynthetic organisms is termed the pho -
tosynthetic active radiation (PAR). We will see in the following that this range has been expanded 
to 750 nm after the discovery of red-shifted chlorophylls.
Infrared light contains the least amount of energy per photon of any other band. Because of 
this, an infrared photon often lacks the energy required to pass the threshold of metabolic path -
ways. Little of the ultraviolet radiation (UV-A and UV-B) and infrared are utilized directly in 
photosynthesis.3142 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThe particles producing the electromagnetic waves are called photons or quanta. The energy ( E) 
in joules (or watts per second) of a photon (or quantum) can be expressed by Planck’s law:
 E = hcλ−1, (3.1)
where h is Planck’s constant (6.626 × 10−34 J s), c the speed of light (3 × 108 m s−1), and λ the photon 
wavelength in meters (m). cλ−1 represents the frequency υ of the photon.
According to this formula, the shorter the photon wavelength, the higher its energy; for example, 
the energy of a photon of 300 nm light is equal to 6.63 × 10−19 J, the energy of a photon of 400 nm 
light is equal to 4.97 × 10−19 J, the energy of a photon of 700 nm light is equal to 2.84 × 10−19 J, while 
the energy of a photon of 4000 nm light is equal to 0.49 × 10−19 J. It takes a larger number of longer-
wavelength photons to supply a given quantity of energy than it does of shorter wavelength photons. 
This relationship has the effect of changing the shape of the curve represented in two different ways: 
the peak of the energy curve is at ~500 nm (Figure 3.1, thin black line), whereas the peak of the 
photon flux density curve is at ~700 nm (inset in Figure 3.1).
The energy of photons can also be expressed in terms of electron volts (eV). Absorption of a 
photon can lead to excitation of an electron and hence of a molecule. This excited electron acquires 
potential energy (capacity of producing chemical work) measured in eV. An electron volt is the

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCpotential energy of 1 V gained by the excited electron, which is equal to 1.60 × 10−19 J. Thus, the 
energy of a photon of 300 nm light is equal to 4.14 eV (i.e., 6.63 × 10−19 J divided by 1.60 × 10−19 J), 
the energy of a photon of 400 nm light is equal to 3.11 eV, the energy of a photon of 700 nm light is 
equal to 1.77 eV, and the energy of a photon of 4000 nm light is equal to 0.30 eV.
The average intensity of the total solar radiation reaching the upper atmosphere is about 
1.4 kW m−2 (UV, 8%; visible light, 41%; infrared radiation, 51%). The amount of this energy that 
reaches any one “spot” on the earth’s surface will vary according to atmospheric and meteorologi -
cal (weather) conditions, the latitude and altitude of the spot, and local landscape features that may 
block the sun at different times of the day. In fact, as sunlight passes through the atmosphere, some 
of it is absorbed, scattered, and reflected by air molecules, water vapor, clouds, dust, and pollutants 
from power plants, forest fires, and volcanoes. Atmospheric conditions can reduce solar radiation 
by 10% on clear, dry days, and by 100% during periods of thick clouds. At sea level, in an ordinary 
clear day, the average intensity of solar radiation is less than 1.0 kW m−2 (UV, 3%; visible light, 42%; 
infrared radiation, 55%). Penetrating water, much of the incident light is reflected from the water 
surface, more light being reflected from a ruffled surface than a calm one and reflection increases 
as the sun becomes lower in the sky (Table 3.1). As light travels through the water column, it under -
goes a decrease in its intensity (attenuation) and a narrowing of the radiation band caused by the 
combined absorption and scattering of everything in the water column including water itself. In 
fact, different wavelengths do not penetrate equally; infrared light (700–4000 nm) penetrates least, 
being almost entirely absorbed within the top 2 m, and ultraviolet light (300–400 nm) is also rapidly 
absorbed. Within the visible spectrum (400–700 nm), red light is absorbed first, much of it within 
the first 5 m. In clear water, the greatest penetration is by the blue-green region of the spectrum 
(450–550 nm), while under more turbid conditions the penetration of blue rays is often reduced to a 
greater extent than that of the yellow-red wavelengths (550–700 nm). Depending on the conditions, 
3–50% of incident light is usually reflected, and Lambert–Beer’s law can describe mathematically 
the way the light decreases as a function of depth:
 Iz = I0e−kz, (3.2)
where Iz is the intensity of light at depth z, I0 the intensity of light at depth 0, that is, at the surface, and k 
the attenuation coefficient, which describes how quickly light attenuates in a particular body of water.
Algae use the light eventually available in two main ways:
• As information in sensing processes, supported by the photoreceptor systems, as already 
explained in Chapter 2.
• As energy in transduction processes, supported by chloroplasts in photosynthesis.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCBoth types of processes depend on the absorption of photons by electrons of chromophore molecules 
with extensive systems of conjugated double bonds. These conjugated double bonds create a distribution 
of delocalized pi electrons over the plane of the molecule. Upon absorption of a photon in the range 
400–700 nm, pi electrons can be driven to an available electronic “excited state” (an unoccupied orbital 
of higher energy, higher meaning the electron is less tightly bound). Only absorption of a photon in this 
range can lead to excitation of the electron and hence of the molecule, since the lower energy of an infra -
red photon could be confused with the energy derived by molecular collisions, eventually increasing 
the noise of the system and not its information; and the higher energy of an UV photon could dislodge 
the electron from the electronic cloud and destroy the molecular bonds of the chromophore. Charge 
separation is produced in the chromophore molecule elevated to the excited state by the absorption of 
a photon, which increases the capability of the molecule to perform work. In sensing processes, charge 
separation is produced by the photo-isomerization of the chromophore around a double bond, thus stor -
ing electrostatic energy, which triggers a chain of conformational changes in the protein that induces 
the signal transduction cascade. In photosynthesis, a charge separation is produced between a photo-
excited molecule of a special chlorophyll (electron donor) and an electron-deficient molecule (electron 
acceptor) located within van der Waals distance, that is, a few angstrom (Å). The electron acceptor in 
turn becomes a donor for a second acceptor and so on; this chain ends in an electron-deficient trap. In 
this way, the free energy of the photon absorbed by the chlorophyll can thereby be used to carry out use -
ful electrochemical work, avoiding its dissipation as heat or fluorescence. The ability to perform electro -
chemical work for each electron that is transferred is termed redox potential; a negative redox potential 
indicates a reducing capability of the system (the system possesses available electrons), while a positive 
redox potential indicates an oxidizing capability of the system (the system lacks available electrons).
Photosynthetic activity of algae, which roughly account for more than 50% of global photosyn -
thesis, makes it possible to convert the energy of PAR into biologically usable energy, by means 
of reduction and oxidation reactions; hence, photosynthesis and respiration must be regarded as 
complex redox processes.
As shown in Equation 3.3, during photosynthesis, carbon is converted from its maximally oxi -
dized state +4 in CO2 to 0 in strongly reduced compounds such as carbohydrates [CH2O]n, using 
the energy of light:
 nCOn HO light CHOn O2Chlor ophyll 
n 22 2 ++ → +a()  (3.3)
In this equation, light is specified as a substrate, chlorophyll a is a requisite catalytic agent, and 
(CH2O)n represent the organic matter reduced to the level of carbohydrate. These reduced com -
pounds may be re-oxidized to CO2 during respiration, liberating energy. The process of photosyn -
thetic electron transport takes place between +0.82 eV (redox potential of the H2O/O2 couple) and 
−0.42 eV (redox potential of the CO2/CH2O couple).
Approximately half of incident light intensity impinging on the earth surface (0.42 kW m−2) 
belongs to PAR. In water, as explained above, the useful energy for photo-biochemical processes is 
even lower and distributed within a narrower wavelength range. About 95% of the PAR impinging 
on algal cells is lost mainly due to the absorption by components other than chloroplasts and to the 
ineffectiveness of the transduction of light energy into chemical energy. Only 5% of the PAR is used 
by photosynthetic processes. Despite this high energy waste, photosynthetic energy transformation 
is the basic energy-supplying process for algae.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Photosynthesis encompasses two major groups of reactions. Those in the first group, the “light-
dependent reactions,” involve the capture of the light energy and its conversion to energy currency 
as NADPH and ATP. These reactions are: absorption and transfer of photon energy, trapping of 
this energy, and generation of a chemical potential. The latter reaction follows two routes: the first 145 Photosynthesis
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCone generates NADPH, thanks to the falling of the high-energy excited electron along an electron 
transport system; the second one generates ATP by means of a proton gradient across the thyla -
koid membrane. Water splitting is the source of both electrons and protons. Oxygen is released as 
a by-product of the water splitting. The reactions of the second group are the “light-independent 
reactions” and involve the sequence of reactions by which this chemical potential is used to fix and 
reduce inorganic carbon in triose phosphates (Figure 3.3).
LIGHT-DEPENDENT REACTIONS
Photosynthetic light reactions take place in thylakoid membranes where chromophore–protein com -
plexes and membrane-bound enzymes are situated (Figure 3.4). The thylakoid membrane cannot be 
considered at all a rigid, immutable structure. It is rather a highly dynamic system, whose molecular 
compositions and conformation, including the spatial pattern of its components, can change very 
rapidly. This flexibility, is, however, combined with a high degree of order necessary for the energy-
transforming processes.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCQuantitative analysis established that the 7-nm-thick thylakoid membrane consists of ~50% lip -
ids and 50% proteins. Galactolipids, a constituent that is specific of thylakoid membranes, make 
up ~40% of the lipid fraction. Chlorophylls, carotenoids, xanthophylls (when present), phycobilins 
(when present), phospholipids, sulfolipids, quinones, and sterols, all components occurring in a 
bound form, represent the remaining 10%.
Chlorophylls are the essential pigments of photosynthesis, for which they both harvest light and 
transduce it into chemical energy. There are five chemically distinct chlorophylls known to date, 
termed chlorophylls a, b, c1, c2, d, and f, which are present in light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) of 
oxygenic photosynthetic organisms (Figures 3.5 and 3.6). Chlorophyll a consists of a hydrophilic 
porphyrin head formed by four linked pyrrole rings with a magnesium atom chelated (Mg2+) at the 
center and a hydrophobic phytol tail. Chlorophyll b possesses the same structure of chlorophyll a, 
but a keto group (–CH ∙O) is present in the second pyrrole ring instead of a methyl group (–CH3). 
Chlorophyll c possesses only the hydrophilic porphyrin head without the phytol tail; chlorophyll c2 
differs from chlorophyll c1 in possessing two vinyl groups (–CH ∙CH2) instead of one. Chlorophyll 
d differs from chlorophyll a only in the C3 position at ring I, where a formyl group in chlorophyll 
d replaces the vinyl group in chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll f differs from chlorophyll a only in the C2 
position at ring I, where a formyl group is present. Chlorophylls a, b, and c were identified in the 
nineteenth century, chlorophyll d was reported in 1943, but recognized only in 1996 in the cya -
nobacterium Acaryochloris marina , whereas chlorophyll f was discovered for the first time in the 
stromatolite-forming cyanobacterium Halomicronema hongdechloris  in 2010.
Each chlorophyll has its own absorption spectrum (Figures 3.5 and 3.6). The discovery of the 
red-shifted chlorophylls d and f has expanded the portion of solar spectrum available for photosyn -
thesis to 750 nm. This relatively modest increment (about 50 nm) increases the number of available 
photons by 19%.
Carotenoids are C40 hydrocarbon chains, strongly hydrophobic, with one or two terminal ionone 
rings, functioning as accessory pigments for energy capture and transfer and for also playing protec -
tion roles. Xanthophylls are carotenoid derivate with a hydroxyl group in the ring; they have a role in 
nonradiative dissipation of excess absorbed light energy (Figures 3.6 and 3.7). Phycobylins (Figure 
3.8) possess the four pyrrolic rings linearly arranged, and unlike the chlorophylls they are strongly 
covalently bound to a protein. These are complex proteins often with more than one subunit, with 
more than one phycobilin as chromophore. Figure 3.9 shows the most common phycobiliproteins. 
They are considered accessory pigments for the operations of photosystem II (see the following 
paragraph). The organization of phycobiliproteins in the phycobilisome has been described in 
Chapter 2 (Figure 2.82).
The protein complex content consists mainly of the highly organized energy-transforming units, 
enzymes for the electron transport and ATP synthesis, more or less integrated into the thylakoid mem -
brane. The energy-transforming units are two large protein complexes termed photosystems I (PSI) 
and II (PSII), surrounded by light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). Photons absorbed by PSI and PSII 
induce excitation of special chlorophylls a, P700 and P680 (P stands for the pigment and 700/680 stand 
for the wavelength in nanometer of maximal absorption), initiating translocation of an electron across 
the thylakoid membrane along organic and inorganic redox couples forming the electron transfer chains 
(ETCs). The main components of these chains are plastoquinones, cytochromes, and ferredoxin. This 
electron translocation process eventually leads to a reduction of NADP+ to NADPH and to a transmem -
brane difference in the electrical potential and H+ concentration, which drives ATP synthesis by means 
of an ATP synthase.
Thylakoid membranes are differentiated into stacked and unstacked regions. Stacking increases 
the amount of thylakoid membranes in a given volume. Both regions surround a common inter -
nal thylakoid space, but only unstacked regions make direct contact with the chloroplast stroma. 
The two regions differ in their content of photosynthetic assemblies; PSI and ATP synthase are 
located almost exclusively in unstacked regions, whereas PSII and LCHII are present mostly in 
stacked regions. This topology derives from protein–protein interactions rather than lipid bilayer 147 Photosynthesis

What is the functional significance of this lateral differentiation of the thylakoid membrane system? 
If both photosystems were present at high density in the same membrane region, a high proportion 
of photons absorbed by PSII would be transferred to PSI because the energy level of the excited-
state P680* relative to its ground-state P680 is higher than that of P700* relative to P700. A lateral sepa -
ration of photosystems solve this problem by placing P680* more than  100 Å away from P700. The 
positioning of PSI in the unstacked membranes gives it direct access to the stroma for the reduction 
of NADP+. In fact, the stroma-exposed surface of PSI, which contains the iron–sulfur proteins that

surface and could not possibly be accommodated within the stacks, where adjacent thylakoids are 
separated by no more than 40 Å. It seems likely that ATP synthase is also located in unstacked 
regions to provide space for its large protruding portion and access to ADP. In contrast, the tight 
quarters of the appressed regions pose no problem for PSII, which interacts with a small polar elec -
tron donor (H2O) and a highly lipid-soluble electron carrier (plastoquinone). According to the model 
of Allen and Forsberg (2001), the close appression of grana (stacks of thylakoids) membranes arises 
because the flat stroma-exposed surfaces of LCHII form recognition and contact surfaces for each 
other, causing opposing surfaces of thylakoids to interact. There is not steric hindrance to this close 
opposition of stacked grana membranes, because like LCHII, PSII itself presents a flat surface that 
protrudes no more than 10–20 Å beyond the membrane surface.
The functional significance of thylakoid stacking is presumably to allow a large, connected, 
light-harvesting antenna to form both within and between membranes. Within this antenna, excita -
tion energy can pass between chlorophylls located in LCHII complexes that are adjacent to each 
other, both within a single membrane and between appressed membranes.
The degree of stacking and the proportion of different photosynthetic assemblies are regulated in 
response to environmental variables such as the intensity and spectral characters of incident light. 
The lateral distribution of LHC is controlled by reversible phosphorylation. At low light levels, LHC 
is bound to PSII. At high light levels, a specific kinase is activated by plastoquinol, and phosphory -
lation of threonine side chains of LHC leads to its release from PSII. The phosphorylated form of 
these light-harvesting units diffuses freely in the thylakoid membrane and may become associated 
with PSI to increase its absorbance coefficient (Figure 3.4).
Central to the photosynthetic process is PSII, which catalyzes one of the most thermodynami -
cally demanding reactions in biology:
 24 422HO eH O →+ +−+
 (3.4)
that is, the photo-induced oxidation of water. PSII has the power to split water and use its electrons 
and protons to drive photosynthesis. The first ancestor bacteria carrying on anoxygenic photosynthesis 
probably synthesized ATP by oxidation of H2S and FeS compounds abundant in the environment. The 
released energy could have been harnessed via production of a proton gradient, stimulating evolution of 
electron transport chains, and the reducing equivalents (electrons) generated used in CO2 fixation and 
thence biosynthesis. This was the precursor of the PSI. About 2800 million years ago, the evolution -
ary pressure to use less strongly reducing (and therefore more abundant) source of electrons appears to 
have culminated in the development of the singularly useful trick of supplying the electrons to the oxi -
dized reaction center from a tyrosine side chain, generating tyrosine cation radicals that are capable of 
sequential abstraction of electrons from water. Oxygenic photosynthesis, which requires the coupling in 
series of two distinct types of reaction centers (PSI and PSII) must have depended upon lateral transfer 
of genes between the evolutionary precursors of the modern sulfur bacteria (whose single reaction cen -
ter resembles PSI) and those of purple bacteria (whose single reaction center resembles PSII). Thus, the 
cyanobacteria appeared. They were the first dominant organisms to use photosynthesis. As a by-product 
of photosynthesis, oxygen (O2) was produced for the first time in abundance. Initially, oxygen released 
by photosynthesis was absorbed by iron (II), abundant in the sea, thus oxidizing it into insoluble iron 
(III) oxide (rust). Red “banded iron deposits” of iron (III) oxide are marked in marine sediments of ca. 
2500 million years ago. Once most/all iron (II) had been oxidized to iron (III), then oxygen appeared 
in, and began to increase in the atmosphere, gradually building up from zero ca. 2500 million years ago 
to approximately present levels ca. 500 million years ago. This was the “oxygen revolution.” Oxygen is 
corrosive, so prokaryotic life either became extinct or survived in anaerobic (oxygen-free) environments 
(and do so to this day), or evolved antioxidant-protective mechanisms. The latter could begin to use 
oxygen to pull electrons from organic molecules, leading to aerobic respiration. The respiratory electron 153 Photosynthesis

cycle probably evolved using steps from several biosynthetic pathways.
Hence, cyanobacteria marked the planet in a very permanent way and paved the way for the sub -
sequent evolution of oxidative respiratory biochemistry. This change marks the end of the Archaean 
Era of the Precambrian time.
psii and psi: sTrUcTUre, FUncTion, and organiza Tion
The PSII and PSI photosynthetic complexes are very similar in eukaryotic algae (and plants) and 
cyanobacteria, as are many elements of the light capture, electron transport, and carbon dioxide 
(CO2) fixation systems. The PSI and PSII complexes contain an internal antenna-domain carrying 
light-harvesting chlorophylls and carotenoids both noncovalently bound to a protein moiety and a 
central core domain where biochemical reactions occur. In the internal antenna complexes, chloro -
phylls do most of the light harvesting, whereas carotenoids and xanthophylls mainly protect against 
excess light energy and possibly transfer the absorbed radiation. In all photosynthetic eukaryotes, 
PSI and PSII form a supercomplex since they are associated with an external antenna termed LHC. 
The main function of LHCs is the absorption of solar radiation and the efficient transmittance of 
excitation energy toward reaction center chlorophylls. LHCs are composed of a protein moiety to 
which chlorophylls and carotenoids are noncovalently bound. In eukaryotic algae, 10 distinct light-
harvesting apoproteins (Lhc) can be distinguished. Four of them are exclusively associated with PSI 
(Lhca1–4), another four with PSII (Lhcb3–6), and two (Lhcb1 and Lhcb2) are preferentially but 
not exclusively associated with PSII, that is, they can shuttle between the two photosystems. The 
apoproteins are three membrane-spanning α-helices and are nuclear-encoded. LHCs are arranged 
externally with respect to the photosystems. In Cyanobacteria, Glaucophyta, Rhodophyta, and 
Cryptophyta, no LHCs are present and the light-harvesting function is performed by phycobilipro -
teins organized in phycobilisomes (Figure 2.82). These structures are peripheral to the thylakoid 
membranes in Cyanobacteria, Glaucophyta, and Rhodophyta (Figures 2.81 and 2.84) and localized 
within the lumen of thylakoids in Cryptophyta. The phycobilisome structure consists of a three-
cylinder core of four stacked molecules of allophycocyanin, closed to the thylakoid membrane, on 
which rod-shaped assemblies of coaxially stacked hexameric molecules of only phycocyanin or 
both phycocyanin and phycoerythrin converge. Phycobilisomes are linked to the PSII but they can 
diffuse along the surface of the thylakoids, at a rate sufficient to allow movements from PSII to PSI 
within 100 ms. Though prokaryotes, Prochlorococcus  sp., Prochlorothrix  sp., and Prochloron  sp. 
differ from other cyanobacteria in possessing an external chlorophyll a and b antenna, like eukary -
otic algae, instead of the large extrinsic phycobilisomes.
PSII complex can be divided into two main protein superfamilies differing in the number of 
membrane-spanning α-helices, that is, the six-helix protein superfamily, which includes the internal 
antennae CP43 and CP47 (CP stands for chlorophyll–protein complex), and the five-helix proteins 
of the reaction center cores D1 and D2 (so-called because they were first identified as two diffuse  
bands by gel electrophoresis and staining), where ETC components are located. External antenna 
proteins of prochlorophytes belong to the six-helix CP43 and CP47 superfamily and not to the three-
helix LHCs superfamily.
PSII is a homodimer, where the two monomers in the dimers are almost identical. The monomer 
consists of over 20 subunits. All the redox active cofactors involved in the activity of PSII are bound 
to the reaction center proteins D1 and D2. Closely associated with these two proteins are the chloro -
phyll a binding proteins CP43 and CP47, and the extrinsic luminally bound proteins of the oxygen-
evolving complex. Each monomer also includes one heme b, one heme c, two plastoquinones, two 
pheophytins (a chlorophyll a without Mg2+), one non-heme Fe and contains 36 chlorophylls a and 
7 all-trans  carotenoids assumed to be β-carotene molecules. Eukaryotic and cyanobacterial PSII 
are structurally very similar at the level of both their oligomeric states and organization of the trans -
membrane helices of their major subunits. The eukaryotic PSII dimer is flanked by two clusters of 154 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCLhcb proteins. Each cluster contains two trimers of Lchb1, Lchb2, and Lchb3 and the other three 
monomers, Lchb4, Lchb5, and Lchb6.
The reactions of PSII are powered by light-driven primary and secondary electron-transfer pro -
cesses across the reaction center (D1 and D2 subunits). Upon illumination, an electron is dislodged 
from the excited primary electron donor P680, a chlorophyll a molecule located towards the luminal 
surface. The electron is quickly transferred toward the stromal surface to the final electron acceptor, 
a plastoquinone, via a pheophytin. After accepting two electrons and undergoing protonation, plas -
toquinone is reduced to plastoquinol, and it is then released from PSII into the membrane matrix. 
The cation P680+ is reduced by a redox active tyrosine, which in turn is reduced by a Mn ion within a 
cluster of four. When the (Mn)4 cluster accumulates four oxidizing equivalents (electrons), two water 
molecules are oxidized to yield one molecule of O2 and four protons. All the redox active cofactors 
involved in the electron-transfer processes are located on the D1 side of the reaction center.
PSI complex possess only an 11-helix PsaA and PsaB protein superfamily. Each 11-transmem -
brane helices subunit has six N-terminal transmembrane helices that bind light-harvesting chloro -
phylls and carotenoids and act as internal antennae and five C-terminal transmembrane helices that 
bind Fe4S4 clusters as terminal electron acceptors. The N-terminal part of the PsaA and PsaB pro -
teins are structurally and functionally homologs to CP43 and CP47 proteins of PSII; the C-terminal 
part of the PsaA and PsaB proteins are structurally and functionally homologs to D1 and D2 pro -
teins of PSII. Eukaryotic PSI is a monomer that is loosely associated with the Lcha moiety, with a 
deep cleft between them. The four antenna proteins assemble into two heterodimers composed by 
Lhca1 and Lhca4, and homodimers composed by Lhca2 and Lhca3. These dimers create a half-
moon-shaped belt that docks to PsaA and PsaB and to other 12 proteic subunits of the PSI, termed 
PsaC to PsaN that contribute to the coordination of antenna chromophores. On the whole, PSI binds 
approximately 200 chromophore molecules. The cyanobacterial PSI exists as a trimer. One mono -
mer consists of at least 12 different protein subunits (PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, PsaI, 
PsaJ, PsaK, PsaL, PsaM, and PsaX) coordinating more than 100 chromophores.
After primary charge separation initiated by excitation of the chlorophyll a pair P700, the electron 
passes along the ETC consisting of another chlorophyll a molecule, a phylloquinone, and the Fe4S4 
clusters. At the stromal side, the electron is donated by Fe4S4 to ferredoxin and then transferred to 
NADP+ reductase. The reaction cycle is completed by re-reduction of P700+ by plastocyanin (or the 
interchangeable cytochrome c6) at the inner (lumenal) side of the membrane. The electron carried by 
plastocyanin is provided by PSII by way of a pool of plastoquinones and the cytochrome b6f complex.
Photosynthetic eukaryotes such as Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, and Glaucophyta have evolved by 
primary endosymbiosis involving a eukaryotic host and a prokaryotic endosymbiont. All other algae 
groups have evolved by secondary (or higher order) endosymbiosis between a simple eukaryotic 
alga and a nonphotosynthetic eukaryotic host. Although the basic photosynthetic machinery is con -
served in all these organisms, it should be emphasized that PSI does not necessarily have the same 
composition and fine-tuning in all of them. The subunits that have only been found in eukaryotes, 
that is, PsaG, PsaH, and PsaN, have actually only been found in plants and in Chlorophyta. Other 
groups of algae appear to have a more cyanobacteria-like PSI. PsaM is also peculiar since it has 
been found in several groups of algae including green algae, in mosses and in gymnosperms. Thus, 
the PsaM subunit appears to be absent only in angiosperms. With respect to the peripheral antenna 
proteins, algae are in fact very divergent. All photosynthetic eukaryotes have Lhcs that belong to 
the same class of proteins. However, the Lhc a associated with PSI appear to have diverged relatively 
early and the stoichiometry and interaction with PSI may well differ significantly between species. 
Even the green algae do not possess the same set of four Lhc a subunits that is found in plants.
Are all these LHCs necessary? They substantially increase the light-harvesting capacity of both 
photosystems by increasing the photon-collecting surface with an associated resonance energy 
transfer to reaction centers, facilitated by specific pigment–pigment interactions. This process is 
related to the transition dipole–dipole interactions between the involved donor and acceptor antenna 
molecules that can be weakly or strongly coupled depending on the distance between and relative 155 Photosynthesis
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCorientation of these dipoles. The energy migrates along a spreading wave since the energy of the 
photon can be found at a given moment in one or the other of the many resonating antenna mol -
ecules. This wave describes merely the spread of the probability of finding the photon in different 
chlorophyll antenna molecules. Energy resonance occurs in the chromophores of the antenna mol -
ecules at the lowest electronic excited state available for an electron, since only this state has a life 
time (10−8 s) long enough to allow energy migration (10−12 s). The radiation-less process of energy 
transfer occurs toward pigments with lower excitation energy (longer-wavelength absorption bands). 
Within the bulk of pigment–protein complexes forming the external and internal antenna system, 
the energy transfer is directed to the chlorophyll a with an absorption peak at longest wavelengths. 
Special chlorophylls a (P680 at PSII and P700 at PSI) located in the reaction center cores represent 
the final step end of the photon trip, since once excited (P680 + hν → P680*; P700 + hν → P700*) they 
become redox active species (P680* → P680+ + e−; P700* → P700+ + e−), that is, each donor releases one 
electron per excitation and activates different electron transport chains.
It is worthwhile to emphasize that in the case of Acaryochloris  marina , chlorophyll a is largely 
replaced by red-shifted chlorophyll d (it accounts for about 98% of the total chlorophylls) in the reaction 
centers and LHCs. Hence, the special chlorophylls in the case of this cyanobacteria will be P713 and P740.
For an image gallery of the three-dimensional models of the two photosystems and LHCs in pro -
karyotic and eukaryotic algae, refer to the websites of Jon Nield and James Barber at the Imperial 
College of London (UK).
aTp synThase
ATP production was probably one of the earliest cellular processes to evolve, and the synthesis of ATP 
from two precursor molecules is the most prevalent chemical reaction in the world. The enzyme that 
catalyzes the synthesis of ATP is the ATP synthase or F0F1–ATPase, one of the most ubiquitous pro -
teins on earth. The F1F0–ATPases comprise a huge family of enzymes with members found not only 
in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, but also in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and in the 
inner membrane of mitochondria. The source of energy for the functioning of ATP synthase is pro -
vided by photosynthetic metabolism in the form of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, 
that is, a higher concentration of positively charged protons in the thylakoid lumen than in the stroma.
The F0F1–ATPase molecule is divided into two portions termed F1 and F0. The F0 portion is 
embedded in the thylakoid membrane, while the F1 portion projects into the lumen. Each portion is 
in turn made up of several different proteins or subunits. In F0, the subunits are named a, b, and c. 
There is one a subunit, two b subunits, and 9–12 c subunits. The large a subunit provides the channel 
through which H+ ions flow back into the stroma. Rotation of the c subunits, which form a ring in the 
membrane, is chemically coupled to this flow of H+ ions. The b subunits are believed to help stabilize 
the F0F1 complex by acting as a tether between the two portions. The subunits of F1 are called α, β, γ, 
δ, and ε. F1 has three copies each of α and β subunits which are arranged in an alternating configura -
tion to form the catalytic “head” of F1. The γ and ε subunits form an axis that links the catalytic head 
of F1 to the ring of c subunits in F0. When proton translocation in F0 causes the ring of c subunits to 
spin, the γ–ε axis also spins because it is bound to the ring. The opposite end of the γ subunit rotates 
within the complex of α and β subunits. This rotation causes important conformational changes in the 
β subunits resulting in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi (inorganic phosphate) and to its release.

Components of the electron transport system in order are plastoquinone, cytochrome b6f complex, 
plastocyanin, and ferredoxin. Each of the components of the electron transport chain has the ability 
to transfer an electron from a donor to an acceptor, though plastoquinone also transfers a proton. 
Each of these components undergoes successive rounds of oxidation and reduction, receiving an 
electron from the PSII and donating the electron to PSI.156 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCPlastoquinone refers to a family of lipid-soluble benzoquinone derivatives with an isoprenoid 
side chain. In chloroplasts, the common form of plastoquinone contains nine repeating isoprenoid 
units. Plastoquinone possesses varied redox states, which together with its ability to bind protons 
and with its small size enables it to act as a mobile electron carrier shuttling hydrogen atoms from 
PSII to the cytochrome b6f complex.
Plastoquinone is present in the thylakoid membrane as a pool of 6–8 molecules per PSII. 
Plastoquinone exists as quinone A ( QA) and quinone B ( QB); QA is tightly bound to the reaction 
center complex of PSII and it is immovable. It is the primary stable electron acceptor of PSII, and 
it accepts and transfers one electron at a time. QB is a loosely bound molecule, which accepts two 
electrons and then takes on two protons before it detaches and becomes QBH2, the mobile reduced 
form of plastoquinone (plastoquinol). QBH2 is mobile within the thylakoid membrane, allowing a 
single PSII reaction center to interact with a number of cytochrome b6f complexes.
Plastoquinone plays an additional role in the cytochrome b6f complex, operating in a compli -
cated reaction sequence known as a Q-cycle. When QB is reduced in PSII, it not only receives two 
electrons from QA, but it also picks up two protons from the stroma matrix and becomes QBH2. It is 
able to carry both electrons and protons (e− and H+ carrier). At the cytochrome b6f complex level, it 
is then oxidized, but FeS and cytochrome b6 can only accept electrons and not protons. So, the two 
protons are released into the lumen. The Q-cycle of the cytochrome b6f complex is great because 
it provides extra protons into the lumen. Here two electrons travel through the two hemes of cyto -
chrome b6 and then reduce QB on the stroma side of the membrane. The reduced QB takes on two 
protons from the stroma, becoming QBH2, which migrates to the lumen side of the cytochrome b6f 
complex where it is again oxidized, releasing two more protons into the lumen. Thus the Q-cycle 
allows formation of more ATP. This Q-cycle links the oxidation of plastoquinol ( QBH2) at one site 
on the cytochrome b6f complex to the reduction of plastoquinone at a second site on the complex in 
a process that contributes additional free energy to the electrochemical proton potential.
The cytochrome b6f complex is the intermediate protein complex in linear photosynthetic elec -
tron transport. It essentially couples PSII and PSI and also provides the means of proton gradient 
formation by using cytochrome groups as redox centers in the electron transport chain, thereby 
separating the electron/hydrogen equivalent into its electron and proton components. The electrons 
are transferred to PSI via plastocyanin and the protons are released into the thylakoid lumen of the 
chloroplast. The electron transport from PSII to PSI via cytochrome b6f complex occurs in about 
7 ms, representing the rate-limiting step of the photosynthetic process.
The cytochrome b6f exists as a dimer of 217 kDa. The monomeric complex contains four large 
subunits (18–32 kDa), including cytochrome f, cytochrome b6, the Rieske FeS iron–sulfur protein 
(ISP), and subunit IV as well as four small hydrophobic subunits, PetG, PetL, PetM, and PetN. The 
monomeric unit contains 13 transmembrane helices: four in cytochrome b6 (helices A–D); three in 
subunit IV (helices E–G); and one each in cytochrome f, the ISP, and the four small hydrophobic 
subunits PetG, PetL, PetM, and PetN. The monomer includes four hemes, one [2Fe-2S] cluster, one 
chlorophyll a, one β-carotene, one plastoquinone. The extrinsic domains of cytochrome f and the 
ISP are on the luminal side of the membrane and are ordered in the crystal structure. Loops and 
chain termini on the stromal side are less well ordered. The ISP contributes to dimer stability by 
domain swapping, its transmembrane helix obliquely spans the membrane in one monomer, and its 
extrinsic domain is part of the other monomer. The two monomers form a protein-free central cavity 
on each side of the transmembrane interface.
Cytochrome c6 is a small soluble electron carrier. It is a highly α-helical heme-containing pro -
tein. It is located on the luminal side of the thylakoid membrane where it catalyzes the electron 
transport from the membrane-bound cytochrome b6f complex to PSI. It is the sole electron carrier 
in some cyanobacteria.
Plastocyanin operates in the inner aqueous phase of the photosynthetic vesicle, transferring elec -
trons from cytochrome f to PSI. It is a small protein (10 kDa) composed of a single polypeptide that 
is coded for in the nuclear genome. Plastocyanin is a β-sheet protein with copper as the central ion 157 Photosynthesis
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthat is ligated to four residues of the polypeptide. The copper ion serves as a one-electron carrier with 
a midpoint redox potential (0.37 eV) near that of cytochrome f. Plastocyanin shuttles electrons from 
the cytochrome b6f complex to PSI by diffusion. Plastocyanin is more common in green algae and 
completely substitutes for cytochrome c6 in the chloroplasts of higher plants. In cyanobacteria and 
green algae, where both cytochrome c6 and plastocyanin are encoded, the alternative expression of 
the homologous protein is regulated by the availability of copper.
Ferredoxin is a small protein (11 kDa) and has the distinction of being one of the strongest soluble 
reductants found in cells (midpoint redox potential = −0.42 eV). The amino acid sequence for fer -
redoxin from different species is known as well as the three-dimensional structure. Plants contain 
different forms of ferredoxin, all of which are encoded in the nuclear genome. In some algae and 
cyanobacteria, ferredoxin can be replaced by a flavoprotein. Ferredoxin operates in the stromal aque -
ous phase of the chloroplast, transferring electrons from PSI to a membrane-associated flavoprotein, 
known as FNR. A 2Fe-2S cluster, ligated by four cysteine residues, serves as one-electron carrier.
Once an electron reaches ferredoxin, however, the electron pathway branches, enabling redox 
free energy to enter other metabolic pathways in the chloroplast. For example, ferredoxin can trans -
fer electrons to nitrite reductase, glutamate synthase, and thioredoxin reductase.
elecTron Transpor T: The z-scheme
The fate of the released electrons is determined by the sequential arrangement of all the components 
of PSII and PSI, which are connected by a pool of plastoquinones, the cytochrome b6f complex and 
the soluble protein cytochrome c6 and plastocyanin cooperating in series. The electrons from PSII 
are finally transferred to the stromal side of PSI and used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH, which is 
catalyzed by ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR). In this process, water acts as an electron 
donor to the oxidized P680 in PSII, and dioxygen (O2) evolves as a by-product.
Photosystem II uses light energy to drive two chemical reactions: the oxidation of water and 
the reduction of plastoquinone. Photochemistry in PSII is initiated by charge separation between 
P680 and pheophytin, creating the redox couple P680+/Pheo−. The primary charge separation reac -
tion takes only a few picoseconds. Subsequent electron-transfer steps prevent the separated charges 
from recombining by transferring the electron from pheophytin to a plastoquinone molecule within 
200 ps. The electron on QA− is then transferred to the QB-site. As already stated, plastoquinone at 
the QB-site differs from plastoquinone at the QA-site in that it works as a two-electron acceptor and 
becomes fully reduced and protonated after two photochemical turnovers of the reaction center. The 
full reduction of plastoquinone at the QB-site requires the addition of two electrons and two protons. 
The reduced plastoquinone (plastoquinol, Q3H2) then unbinds from the reaction center and diffuses 
in the hydrophobic core of the membrane, after which an oxidized plastoquinone molecule finds its 
way to the QB-binding site and the process is repeated. Because the QB-site is near the outer aqueous 
phase, the protons added to plastoquinone during its reduction are taken from the outside the mem -
brane. Electrons are passed from Q3H2 to a membrane-bound cytochrome b6f, concomitant with 
the release of two protons to the luminal side of the membrane. The cytochrome b6f then transfers 
one electron to a mobile carrier in the thylakoid lumen, either plastocyanin or cytochrome c6. This 
mobile carrier serves as an electron donor to PSI reaction center, the P700. Upon photon absorption 
by PSI, a charge separation occurs with the electron fed into a bound chain of redox sites: a chlo -
rophyll a (A0), a quinone acceptor ( A1), and then a bound Fe–S cluster, and then two Fe–S cluster 
in ferredoxin, a soluble mobile carrier on the stromal side. Two ferredoxin molecules can reduce 
NADP+ to NADPH, via the flavoprotein ferredoxin–NADP+ oxidoreductase. NADPH is used as a 
redox currency for many biosynthesis reactions such as CO2 fixation. The energy conserved in a 
mole of NADPH is about 52.5 kcal, while in an ATP mole is 7.3 kcal.
The photochemical reaction triggered by P700 is a redox process. In its ground state, P700 has a 
redox potential of 0.45 eV and can take up an electron from a suitable donor, hence it can perform 158 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCan oxidizing action. In its excited state, it possesses a redox potential of more than −1.0 eV and 
can perform a reducing action donating an electron to an acceptor, and becoming P700+. The cou -
ple P700/P700+ is thus a light-dependent redox enzyme and possesses the ability to reduce the most 
electron-negative redox system of the chloroplast, the ferredoxin–NADP+ oxidoreductase (redox 
potential  = −0.42 eV). On the other hand, P700 in its ground state (redox potential = 0.45 eV) is not 
able to oxidize, that is, to take electrons from water that has a higher redox potential (0.82 eV). 
The transfer of electrons from water is driven by the P680 at PSII, which in its ground state has a 
sufficiently positive redox potential (1.22 eV) to oxidize water. On its excited state, the P680 at PSII 
reaches a redox potential of about −0.60 eV that is enough to donate an electron to a plastoquinone 
(redox potential  = 0 eV) and then via cytochrome b6f complex to P700+ at PSI so that it can return to 
P700 and be excited once again. This reaction pathway is called the “Z scheme of photosynthesis,” 
because the redox diagram from P680 to P700 looks like a big “Z” (Figure 3.10).
From this scheme, it is evident that only approximately one-third of the energy absorbed by the 
two primary electron donors P680 and P700 is turned into chemical form. A 680-nm photon has an 
energy of 1.82 eV, a 700-nm photon has an energy of 1.77 eV (total = 3.59 eV), that is, three times 
more than the energy sufficient to change the potential of an electron by 1.24 eV, from the redox 
potential of the water (0.82 eV) to that of ferredoxin–NADP+ oxidoreductase ( −0.42 eV).
It is worthwhile to emphasize that any photon that is absorbed by any chlorophyll molecules is 
energetically equivalent to a red photon since the extra energy of an absorbed photon of shorter 
wavelengths ( <680 nm) is lost during the quick fall to the red energy level representing the lowest 
excited level.
proTon Transpor T: mechanism  oF phoTosyn TheTic phosphoryla Tion
The interplay of PSI and PSII leads to the transfer of electrons from H2O to NADPH and the con -
comitant generation of proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane for ATP synthesis. The thy -
lakoid space becomes markedly acidic, approaching pH 4. The light-induced transmembrane proton 
gradient is about 3.5 pH units. The generation of these protons follows two routes:
• Four protons are released in the thylakoid space for the splitting of two water molecules 
and the release of one oxygen molecule. 
• The transport of four electrons through the cytochrome b6f complex leads to the transloca -
tion of eight protons from the stroma to the thylakoid space.
Therefore, about 12 protons for each O2 molecule released are translocated. The proton-motive 
force Δp, that is, the force created by the accumulation of hydrogen ions on one side of the thylakoid 
membrane, consists of a pH gradient contribution and a membrane-potential contribution. In chlo -
roplasts, nearly all of Δp arise from the pH gradient, whereas in the mitochondria the contribution 
from the membrane potential is larger. This difference is due to the thylakoid membrane perme -
ability to Cl− and Mg2+. The light-induced transfer of H+ into the thylakoid space is accompanied 
by the transfer of either Cl− in the same direction or Mg2+ in the opposite direction (1 per 2 H+). 
Consequently, electrical neutrality is maintained and no membrane potential is generated. A pH of 
3.5 units across the thylakoid membrane correspond to Δp of 0.22 V or a ΔG (change in Gibbs free 
energy) of −4.8 kcal/mol. The change in Gibbs free energy associated with a chemical reaction is a 
useful indicator of whether the reaction will proceed spontaneously. This energy is called free energy 
because it is the energy that will be released or freed up to do work. Since the change in free energy 
is equal to the maximum useful work which can be accomplished by the reaction, then a negative 
ΔG associated with a reaction indicates that it can happen spontaneously. About three protons flow 
through the F0F1 ATPase complex per ATP synthesized, which corresponds to a free energy input of 
14.4 kcal per mole of ATP, but in which only 7.3 kcal are stored in the ATP molecule with a yield of 
about 50%. No ATP is synthesized if the pH gradient is less than two units because the gradient force 159 Photosynthesis
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCis then too small. The newly synthesized ATP is released into the stromal space. Likewise, NADPH 
formed by PSI is released into the stromal space. Thus, ATP and NADPH, the products of light reac -
tions of photosynthesis, are appropriately positioned for the subsequent light-independent reactions, 
in which CO2 is converted into carbohydrates. The overall reaction can be expressed as

This equation implies that each H2O is split in the thylakoids under the influence of light to give off 
1/2O2 molecule and that the two electrons thus freed are then transferred to two molecules of NADP+, 
along with H+, to produce the strong reducing agent NADPH. Two molecules of ATP can be simul -
taneously formed from two ADP and two inorganic phosphates (Pi) so that the energy is stored in 
high-energy compounds. NADPH and ATP are the assimilatory power required to reduce CO2 to car -
bohydrates in the light-independent phase. The generation of ATP following this route is termed non -
cyclic phosphorylation since electrons are just transported from water to NADP+ and do not come back.
An alternative pathway for ATP production is cyclic phosphorylation, in which electrons from 
PSI cycle in a closed system through the phosphorylation sites and ATP is the only product formed. 
Electron arising from P700 are transferred to ferredoxin and then to the cytochrome b6f complex. 
Protons are pumped by this complex as electrons return to the oxidized form of reaction center 
P700 through plastocyanine. This cyclic phosphorylation takes place when NADP is unavailable to 
accept electrons from reduced ferredoxin because of a very high ratio of NADPH to NADP+.
The electrochemical potential of the proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP through an 
ATP-synthase situated, as we have seen, anisotropically in the thylakoid membrane.

Absorption spectra can give us information about the spectral range in which pigment molecules 
organized in the thylakoid membranes capture photons. Absorption spectra in the visible range, from 
400 to 700 nm, have been measured in vivo  on photosynthetic compartments (thylakoid membranes, 
chloroplasts) of single cells belonging to each algal division. Each spectrum represents the envelope of 
the real absorption data and is coupled to the plot of the fourth-derivative absorption spectrum. This 
mathematical tool allows the resolution of absorption maxima relative to the different components 
of the pigment moiety characterizing the division, which cannot be detected in the envelope spec -
trum because of the overlapping of their multiple spectra. These components have been grouped and 
related to the following pigment classes: chlorophylls a, b, c1 c2, d, and f, carotenoids, xanthophylls, 
cytochromes, and phycobiliproteins. Each pigment possesses its own distinctive absorption spectrum 
in the visible range, which have been decomposed in its Gaussian bands and relative absorption 
maxima. By relating the absorption maxima resolved by means of fourth-derivative analysis with 
the absorption maxima of the Gaussian bands of the different pigments, it is possible to predict the 
presence of a specific pigment in an alga and to give an unknown alga a plausible taxonomic framing.
Chlorophylls and cytochromes always show the same absorption maxima independent of the algal 
division, though the intensity of their absorption bands may change; phycobiliproteins, carotenoids, 
and xanthophylls show a variable distribution of their single components, which is characteristic 
of each algal division. Figures 3.11 through 3.14 show the absorption spectra of the photosynthetic 
compartments in all the different algal divisions. The absorption spectrum of the tissue of a higher 
plant, a lawn daisy ( Bellis perennis ), is shown for highlighting the uniformity of the pigment distri -
bution throughout the algal green lineage and plants (Figure 3.15).
It should be stressed that all the pigments other than chlorophyll a perform two main functions: 
protection of photosynthetic assemblies from photosensitization processes (mainly carotenoids); 
absorption of light at wavelengths other than those absorbed by chlorophyll a and transfer of its 
energy to P680 and P700.

products are those listed in Table 1.4 (sucrose, paramylon, starch, etc.). The fixation of CO2 takes 
place during the light-independent phase using the assimilatory power of NADPH and ATP 
in the chloroplast stroma (eukaryotic algae) or in the cytoplasm (prokaryotic algae). The light-  
independent reactions do not occur in the dark; rather they occur simultaneously with the light 
reactions. However, light is not directly involved. The light-independent reactions are commonly 
referred to as the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle (CBB cycle) after the pioneering work of its 
discoverers (Figure 3.16).
The first metabolite was a 3-carbon organic acid known as 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG). For this 
reason, the pathway of carbon fixation in algae and most plants is referred to as C3 photosynthesis. 
Since the first product was a C3 acid, Calvin hypothesized that the CO2 acceptor would be a C2 
compound. However, no such C2 substrate was found. Rather, it was realized that the CO2 acceptor

FIGURE 3.16  Schematic drawing of the three phases of the CBB cycle.166 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCwas a C5 compound, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), and that the product of carboxylation was 
two molecules of 3-PG. This crucial insight allowed the pathway of carbon flow to be determined.
While the CBB cycle involves a total of 13 individual enzymatic reactions, only two enzymes are 
unique to this pathway: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and phospho -
ribulokinase (PRK). All other enzymes involved also perform functions in heterotrophic metabolism. 
PRK catalyzes the phosphorylation of ribulose-monophosphate to ribulose-1,5-  bisphosphate (RUBP). 
RUBP in turn is the substrate for RuBisCO, which catalyzes the actual carbon fixation reaction.
rUbisco
The RuBisCO enzyme alone represents the most important pathway by which inorganic carbon 
enters the biosphere. It has also been described as the most abundant protein on earth. It is thought 
that as much as 95% of all carbon fixations by C3 organisms (that includes all phytoplankton) occur 
through RuBisCO.
RuBisCO is known to catalyze at least two reactions: the reductive carboxylation of ribulose 
1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to form two molecules of 3-PG and the oxygenation of RuBP to form one 
molecule of 3-PG and one molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate.
The oxygenation of RuBP is commonly referred to as photorespiration and has traditionally been 
seen as a wasteful process, because the regeneration of RuBP in photorespiration leads to the evolu -
tion of CO2 and requires free energy in the form of ATP. In addition, RuBisCO suffers from several 
other inefficiencies. Both reactions (carboxylation and oxygenation) occur in the same active site and 
compete, making the enzyme extremely sensitive to local partial pressures of CO2 and O2. RuBisCO 
makes up 20–50% of the protein in chloroplasts. It acts very slowly, catalyzing three molecules per 
second. This compares to 1000 molecules per second for typical enzymatic reactions. Large quanti -
ties are needed to compensate for its slow speed. Lastly, RuBisCO rarely performs its function at a 
maximum rate ( Kmax), since the partial pressure of CO2 in the vicinity of the enzyme is often smaller 
than its Michaelis–Menten half-saturation constant ( Km). RuBisCO has been shown to occur in two 
distinct forms in nature termed Form I and II, respectively. Form I of the enzyme is an assemblage of 
eight 55-kDa large subunits (rbcL) and eight 15-kDa small subunits (rbcS). These subunits assemble 
into a 560-kDa hexadecameric protein-complex designated as L8S8. Most photosynthetic prokaryotes 
that depend on the CBB-cycle for carbon assimilation and all eukaryotic algae express a Form I type 
RuBisCO. The exception to this rule can be found in several marine dinoflagellates, which apparently 
contain a nuclear encoded Form II of RuBisCO. Form II of RuBisCO is a dimer of large subunits 
(L2) and is otherwise found in many photosynthetic and chemoautotrophic bacteria. Phylogenetic 
analysis of a large number of Form I rbcL DNA sequences revealed the division of Form I into four 
major clades referred to as IA, IB, IC, and ID. Form IA is commonly found in nitrifying and sulfur-
oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria as well as some marine Synechococcus  (marine type A) as well 
as all Prochlorococcus  strains sequenced to date. All other cyanobacteria as well as all green algae 
possess a Form IB type enzyme. Form IC of rbcL is expressed by some photosynthetic bacteria such 
as hydrogen oxidizers. Form ID encompasses a diverse group of eukaryotic lineages including essen -
tially all chromophytic, eukaryotic algae such as Rhodophyta, Bacillariophyceae, Raphidophyceae 
and Phaeophyceae.
The phylogeny of RuBisCO displays several interesting incongruences with phylogenies derived 
from ribosomal DNA sequences. This has led to the speculation that over evolutionary history, numer -
ous lateral gene transfers may have occurred, transferring RuBisCO among divergent lineages. For 
example, the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyhedra  contains a Form II RuBisCO most similar to 
sequences found in proteobacteria. Within the Form I clade, as many as six lateral transfers have been 
suggested to explain the unusual phylogeny observed among cyanobacteria, proteobacteria, and plas -
tids. Some bacteria may have acquired a green-like cyanobacterial gene, while marine Synechococcus  
and Prochlorococcus  almost certainly obtained their RuBisCO genes from a purple bacterium.167 Photosynthesis
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThree-dimensional structures of the RuBisCO enzyme are now known for a number of species, 
including Synechococcus , the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , and the red alga Galdieria 
sulphuraria . Based on these and other studies, it is now believed that the primary catalytic struc -
ture of RuBisCO is a dimer of two large subunits (L2). In Form I RuBisCO, four L2 dimers are 
cemented to form L8S8 hexadecameric superstructure, whereby the major contacts between the 
L2 dimers are mediated by the small subunits. A Mg2+ cofactor as well as the carbamylation of 
Lys201 is required for the activity of the enzyme. A loop in the beta barrel and two other elements 
of the large subunit, one in the N- and one in the C-terminus of the protein, form the active site 
in Synechococcus . Small subunits apparently do not contribute to the formation of the active site.
calVin–benson –bassham  cycle
The reactions of the Calvin cycle can be thought of as occurring in three phases (Figure 3.16):
 1. Carboxylation—fixation of CO2 into a stable organic intermediate
 2. Reduction—reduction of this intermediate to the level of carbohydrate
 3. Regeneration—regeneration of the CO2 acceptor
carboxyla Tion
Carboxylation involves the addition of one molecule of CO2 to a 5-carbon “acceptor” molecule, 
ribulose biphosphate (RuBP). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme RuBisCO. Plants invest a 
huge amount of their available nitrogen into making this protein. As a result, RuBisCO is the most 
abundant protein in the biosphere. The resulting 6-carbon product splits into two identical 3-carbon 
products. These products are 3-PG. At this point in the cycle, CO2 has been “fixed” into an organic 
product but no energy has been added to the molecule.
redUcTion
The second step in the Calvin cycle is the reduction of 3-PG to the level of carbohydrate. This reac -
tion occurs in two steps: (1) phosphorylation of 3-PG by ATP to form 1,3-biphosphoglycerate (1,3-
BPG); (2) reduction of 1,3-BPG by NADPH to form glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a simple 
3-carbon carbohydrate, and its isomers collectively called triose phosphates. This reaction requires 
both ATP and NADPH, the high-energy chemical intermediates formed in the light reactions.
The NADP + and ADP formed in this process return to the thylakoids to regenerate NADPH and 
ATP in the light reactions.
regenera Tion
The final stage in the Calvin cycle is the regeneration of the CO2 acceptor RuBP. This involves a 
series of reactions that convert triose phosphate first to the 5-carbon intermediate Ru5P (ribulose 
5-phosphate), then phosphorylation of Ru5P to regenerate RuBP (ribulose-bisphosphate). This final 
step requires ATP formed in the light reactions.
Overall, for every three turns of the cycle, one molecule of product (triose phosphate) is formed 
(3CO2:1G3P). The remaining 15 carbon atoms (5 G3P) re-enter the cycle to produce three molecules 
of RuBP.
The triose phosphate formed in the Calvin cycle can remain in the chloroplast where it is con -
verted to starch. This is why chloroplasts form starch grains. Alternatively, triose phosphate can be 
exported from the chloroplast where it is converted to carbohydrates in the cytoplasm. Both reac -
tions involve the release of phosphate. In the case of carbohydrates, the phosphate must be returned 
to the chloroplast to support continued photophosphorylation (ATP formation).168 Algae

 (3.6)
phoTorespira Tion
Photosynthetic organisms must cope with a competing reaction that inhibits photosynthesis known 
as photorespiration. Unlike photosynthesis, this process involves the uptake of oxygen and the 
release of carbon dioxide.
Recall that mitochondrial respiration involves the uptake of O2 and the evolution of CO2 and is 
associated with the burning of cellular fuel to obtain energy in the form of ATP. In contrast, photo -
respiration starts in the chloroplast and actually wastes energy.
Photorespiration can be defined as the light-dependent uptake of O2 in the chloroplast. It is 
caused by a fundamental “inefficiency” of RuBisCO.
During photosynthesis, RuBisCO catalyzes the carboxylation of RuBP to give two molecules 
of PGA. However, it can also catalyze the oxygenation of RuBP to give one molecule of PGA and 
one molecule of a 2-carbon compound called phosphoglycolate. This reaction occurs because O2 
can compete with CO2 at the active site of RuBisCO. Since oxygenation of RuBP competes with 
carboxylation, it lowers the efficiency of photosynthesis. A significant portion (25%) of the carbon 
in phosphoglycolate is lost as CO2. Algae must use energy to “recover” the remaining 75% of this 
carbon, which further limits the efficiency of photosynthesis.
If photorespiration lowers the yield of photosynthesis, why has such a process been maintained 
throughout the course of evolution? The answer to this intriguing question has to do with the origins 
of RuBisCO and the CBB cycle. RuBisCO is an ancient enzyme, having evolved over 2.5 billion 
years ago in cyanobacteria. During this period in earth’s history, the atmosphere contained high 
levels of CO2 and very little oxygen. Thus, photorespiration did not present a problem for early 
photosynthetic organisms. By the time oxygen accumulated to significant levels in the atmosphere 
(ironically, by the process of photosynthesis!), the catalytic mechanism of RuBisCO was apparently 
“fixed.” In other words, since both O2 and CO2 compete for the same active site of the enzyme, algae 
could not decrease the efficiency of oxygenation without also decreasing the efficiency of carboxyl -
ation. To compensate, algae evolved an elaborate pathway, known as the photorespiratory pathway, 
to recover at least some of the carbon that would otherwise be lost. This pathway involved biochemi -
cal reactions in the chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. The importance of photorespira -
tion is easily demonstrated by the fact that nearly all plants grow better under high CO2 versus 
low CO2. Conditions that favor carboxylation (photosynthesis) over oxygenation (photorespiration) 
include high CO2, moderate light intensities, and moderate temperatures. Conditions that favor oxy -
genation over carboxylation include low CO2 levels, high temperatures, and high light intensities.
THE ENERGY RELATIONSHIPS IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS: THE BALANCE SHEET
The consumption of a mole of glucose releases 686 kcal of energy. This value represents the differ -
ence between the energy needed to break the bonds of the reactants (glucose and oxygen) and the 
energy liberated when the bonds of the products (H2O and CO2) form. Conversely, the photosyn -
thesis of a mole of glucose requires the input of 686 kcal of energy. The overall equation for each 
process is the same; only the direction of the arrow differs:
 CH OO HO CO61 26 22 2 66 6 +↔ + (3.7)169 Photosynthesis
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThe average bond energies between common atoms are the following:
• C–H = 98 kcal/mol
• O–H = 110 kcal/mol
• C–C = 80 kcal/mol
• C–O = 78 kcal/mol
• H–H  = 103 kcal/mol
• C–N = 65 kcal/mol
• O∙O = 116 kcal/mol
• C∙C = 145 kcal/mol
• C∙O (as found in CO2) = 98 kcal/mol
The 24 covalent bonds of glucose require a total of 2182 kcal to be broken. The six double bonds 
of oxygen require another 696. Thus, a grand total of 2878 kcal is needed to break all the bonds of 
the reactants in cellular respiration.
As for the products, the formation of six molecules of CO2 involves the formation of 12 double 
polar covalent bonds each with a bond energy of 187 kcal; total = 2244 kcal. The formation of 
six molecules of H2O involves the formation of 12 O–H bonds each with an energy of 110 kcal; 
total = 1320 kcal. Thus, a grand total of 3564 kcal is released as all the bonds of the products form.
Subtracting this from the 2878 kcal needed to break the bonds of the reactants, we arrive at 
−686 kcal, the free energy change in the oxidation of glucose. This value holds true whether we 
oxidize glucose quickly by burning it or in the orderly process of cellular respiration in mitochon -
dria. The minus sign indicates that free energy has been removed from the system. The details of 
the energy budget are just the same. The only difference is that now it takes 3564 kcal to break 
the bonds of the reactants and only 2878 kcal are released in forming glucose and oxygen. So we 
express this change in free energy ( +686 kcal) with a plus sign to indicate that energy has been 
added to the system. The energy came from the sun and now is stored in the form of bond energy 
that can power the needs of all life.
Photosynthetic reduction of CO2 can be summarized by the equations:
 24 422HO OH e →+ ++−
 (3.8)
 CO He CHOH O22 2 44++ →++−() (3.9)
Four electrons have to be transferred from water, through a redox span of 1.24 eV, to reduce one 
molecule of CO2. The energy required for the reduction of 1 mol of CO2 is therefore

Working with Light
HOW LIGHT BEHAVES
In Chapter 3, we have already described the dual nature of light, defining it as electromagnetic radi -
ation with particle and wave properties. Light consists of tiny packets or particles termed photons 
that propagate through space as electromagnetic waves. Whether it be transmitted to a radio from 
the broadcast station, heat radiating from the oven, furnace, or fireplace, x-rays of teeth, or the vis -
ible and ultraviolet light emanating from the sun, the various forms of electromagnetic radiation all 
share fundamental wave-like properties. Every form of electromagnetic radiation, including visible 
light, oscillates in a periodic fashion with peaks and valleys, and displays a characteristic amplitude, 
wavelength, and frequency. The standard unit of measure for all electromagnetic radiation is the 
magnitude of the wavelength ( λ) and is measured by the distance between one wave crest and the 
next. Wavelength is usually measured in nanometers (nm) for the visible light portion of the spec -
trum. Each nanometer represents one-thousandth of a micrometer. The corresponding frequency 
(ν) of the radiation wave, that is, the number of complete wavelengths that passes a given point per 
second, is proportional to the reciprocal of the wavelength. Frequency is usually measured in cycles 
per second or Hertz (Hz). Thus, longer wavelengths correspond to lower frequency radiation and 
shorter wavelengths correspond to higher frequency radiation. A wave is characterized by a velocity 
(the speed of light) and phase. If two waves arrive at their crests and troughs at the same time, they 
are said to be in phase.
An electromagnetic wave, although it carries no mass, does carry energy. The amount of energy 
carried by a wave is related to the amplitude of the wave (how high is the crest). A high-energy 
wave is characterized by high amplitude; a low-energy wave is characterized by low amplitude. The 
energy transported by a wave is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave. 
The electromagnetic wave does not need any medium for its sustainability; unlike sound, light can 
travel in the vacuum.
During their traveling, light waves interact with matter. The consequences of this interaction are 
that the waves are either scattered or absorbed. In the following, we describe the principal behaviors 
of light.
SCATTERING
Scattering is the process by which small particles suspended in a medium of a different density 
diffuse a portion of the incident radiation in all directions. In scattering, no energy transformation 
results, there is only a change in the spatial distribution of the radiation (Figure 4.1).
In the case of solar radiation, scattering is due to its interaction with gas molecules and sus -
pended particles found in the atmosphere. Scattering reduces the amount of incoming radiation 
reaching the earth’s surface since significant proportion of solar radiation is redirected back to 
space. The amount of scattering that takes place depends upon two factors: wavelength of the 
incoming radiation and the size of the scattering particle or gas molecule. For small particles 
compared to the visible radiation, Rayleigh’s scattering theory holds. It states that the intensity of 
scattered waves roughly in the same direction of the incoming radiation is inversely proportional 
to the fourth power of the wavelength. In the earth’s atmosphere, the presence of a large number 
of small particles compared to the visible radiation (with a size of about 0.5 μm) causes shorter 4174 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCwavelengths of the visible range to be more intensely diffused. This factor causes our sky to appear 
blue because this color corresponds to those wavelengths. When the scattering particles are very 
much larger than the wavelength, the intensity of scattered waves roughly in the same direction of 
the incoming radiation become independent of wavelength and for this reason, the clouds, made 
of large raindrops, are white. If scattering did not occur in our atmosphere, the daylight sky would 
be black.
ABSORPTION
Some molecules have the ability to absorb incoming light. Absorption is defined as a process in 
which light is retained by a molecule. In this way, the free energy of the photon absorbed by the 
molecule can be used to carry out work, either emitted as fluorescence or dissipated as heat.
The Lambert–Beer law is the basis for measuring the amount of radiation absorbed by a mol -
ecule, a subcellular compartment, such as a chloroplast or a photoreceptive apparatus and a cell, 
such as a unicellular alga (Figure 4.2). A plot of the amount of radiation absorbed (absorbance, Aλ)

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCas a function of wavelengths is called a spectrum. The Lambert–Beer law states that the variation in 
the intensity of the incident beam as it passes through a sample is proportional to the concentration 
of that sample and its thickness (path length). We have adopted this law to measure the absorption 
spectra in all algal photosynthetic compartments presented in Chapter 3.
The Lambert–Beer law states the logarithmic relationship between absorbance and the ratio 
between the incident ( II) and the transmitted light ( IT). In turn, absorbance is linearly related to the 
pigment concentration C (mol  L−1), the path length l (cm), and the molar extinction coefficient ελ, 
which is substance-specific and is a function of the wavelength:

INTERFERENCE
Electromagnetic waves can superimpose. Scattered waves, all of which usually have the same fre -
quency, are particularly susceptible to the phenomenon of interference, in which waves can get 
added constructively or destructively. When two waves, vibrating in the same plane, meet and the 
crests of one wave coincide with the crests of the other wave, that is, they are in phase, then con -
structive interference occurs. Therefore, the amplitude of the wave has been increased and this 
results in the light appearing brighter. If the two waves are out of phase, that is, if the crests of one 
wave encounter the troughs of the other, then destructive interference occurs. The two waves cancel 
each other out, resulting in a dark area (Figure 4.3). The interference of scattered waves gives rise 
to reflection, refraction, diffusion, and diffraction phenomena.
REFLECTION
Reflection results when light is scattered in the direction opposite to that of incident light. Light 
reflecting off a polished or mirrored flat surface obeys the law of reflection: the angle between the 
incident ray and the normal to the surface ( θI) is equal to the angle between the reflected ray and TABLE 4.1

surfaces are primarily specular in nature. Even transparent glass specularly reflects a portion of 
incoming light. Diffuse reflection is typical of particulate substances such as powders. If you shine 
a light on baking flour, for example, you will not see a directionally shiny component. The powder 
will appear uniformly bright from every direction. Many reflections are a combination of both dif -
fuse and specular components and are termed spread (Figure 4.4), such as that performed by the 
blooms of the haptophyte emiliana huxley (cf. Chapter 5).
Now we will turn our attention to the topic of curved mirrors, especially curved mirrors that 
have the shape of spheres—the spherical mirrors. Spherical mirrors can be thought of as a portion 
of a sphere that was sliced away and then silvered on one of the sides to form a reflecting surface. 
Concave mirrors were silvered on the inside of the sphere and convex mirrors were silvered on the 
outside of the sphere (Figure 4.5). If a concave mirror were thought to have been a slice of a sphere, 
then there would be a line passing through the center of the sphere and attaching to the mirror in 
the exact center of the mirror. This line is known as the principal axis. The center of the sphere 
from which the mirror was sliced is known as the center of curvature of the mirror. The point on 
the mirror’s surface where the principal axis meets the mirror is known as the vertex. The vertex 
is the geometric center of the mirror. Midway between the vertex and the center of curvature is the 
focal point. The distance from the vertex to the center of curvature is known as the radius of curva -
ture. The radius of curvature is the radius of the sphere from which the mirror was cut. Finally, the 
distance from the mirror to the focal point is known as the focal length. The focal point is the point 
in space at which light incident towards the mirror and traveling parallel to the principal axis will 
meet after reflection. In fact, if some light from the sun was collected by a concave mirror, then it 
would converge at the focal point. Because the sun is at such a large distance from the earth, any 
Intensity
FIGURE 4.3  Interference of light passing through two narrow slits, each acting as a source of waves. The 
superimposition of waves produces a pattern of alternating bright and dark bands. When crest meets crest or 
trough meets trough, constructive interference occurs, which makes bright bands; when crest meets trough, 
destructive interference occurs, which creates dark bands. The dots indicate the points of constructive inter -
ference. The light intensity distribution shows a maximum that corresponds to the highest number of dots.177 Working with Light
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLClight rays from the sun that strike the mirror will essentially be traveling parallel to the principal 
axis. As such, this light should reflect through the focal point.
Unlike the concave mirror, a convex mirror can be described as a spherical mirror with silver 
on the outside of the sphere. In convex mirrors, the focal point is located behind the convex mir -
ror, and such a mirror is said to have a negative focal length value. A convex mirror is sometimes 
referred to as a diverging mirror due to its ability to take light from a point and diverge it. Any 
incident ray traveling parallel to the principal axis on the way to a convex mirror will reflect in a 
manner that its extension will pass through the focal point. Any incident ray traveling towards a 
convex mirror such that its extension passes through the focal point will reflect and travel parallel 
to the principal axis.
REFRACTION
Refraction results when light is scattered in the same direction as that of incident light but when 
passing between dissimilar materials, the rays bend and change their velocities slightly. Refraction 
is dependent on two factors: the incident angle θ, that is, the angle between the incident light and the 
normal to the surface, and the refractive index, n of the material, defined as the ratio between the 
velocity of the wave in vacuum, cv, and the velocity of the wave in the medium, cs:

where 1n2 is the refractive index while passing from medium 1 to medium 2 and θ1 and θ2 are the

For a typical air–water boundary ( nair = 1, nwater = 1.333), a light ray entering the water at 45° 
from normal travels through the water at 32.11° (Figure 4.6).
The refractive index decreases with increasing wavelength. This angular dispersion causes blue 
light to refract more than red, causing rainbows and allowing prisms to separate the spectrum (dis -
persion). Table 4.2 shows the refractive index of some common materials.
DISPERSION
Dispersion is a phenomenon that causes the separation of a light into components with different 
wavelengths, due to their different velocity in a medium other than vacuum. As a consequence, the 
white light traveling through a triangular prism is separated into its color components, the spectrum 
of light. The red portion of the spectrum deviates less than the violet from the direction of propaga -
tion of the white light (Figure 4.7).
DIFFRACTION

as a narrow aperture or slit (Figure 4.8). Diffraction depends on both wavelength of incoming

mately achieve ( a/λ tends to zero). The resolution is the smallest distance between two points to 
discriminate them as separate.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCFIELD INSTRUMENTS: USE AND APPLICATION
Almost all light in the natural environment originates from the sun. Its spectral distribution is simi -
lar to that of an efficient radiant surface known as a blackbody at a temperature of 5800°C, which 
ranges from 100 to 4000 nm (Figure 3.1).
While passing through the atmosphere, a small portion of this light is absorbed and some is 
scattered. Short wavelengths are strongly scattered, and ozone absorption effectively eliminates 
wavelengths less than 300 nm. At longer wavelengths, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and oxy -
gen absorb light significantly at particular wavelengths, producing sharp dips in the spectrum. 
At still-longer wavelengths, beyond 4000 nm, all objects in the environment become significant 
sources of radiations, depending on their temperature, and surpass sunlight in intensity. These 
characteristics of the environment restrict the range of electromagnetic radiation. Solar radiant 
energy that reaches the surface of the earth has a spectral range from about 300 nm (ultraviolet) 
to about 4000 nm (infrared). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) occurs between approxi -
mately 400 and 750 nm and is less than 50% of the total energy impinging on the earth’s surface 
(Figure 3.2).
Before describing the detectors used in the field application, a short lexicon of the terms and the 
conversion units on light measurements would be very useful because of the plethora of confusing 
terminology and units.
RADIOMETRY
Radiometry is the science of measuring light in any portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. In 
practice, the term is usually limited to the measurement of infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light 
using optical instruments, such as radiation thermocouples, bolometers, photodiodes, photosensi -
tive dyes and emulsions, vacuum phototubes, charge-coupled devices, etc.
MEASUREMENT GEOMETRIES: SOLID ANGLES
One of the key concepts to understanding the relationships between measurement geometries is that 
of the solid angle, ω. This can be defined as the angle that, seen from the center of the sphere, includes 
a given area on the surface of that sphere. The value of a solid angle is numerically equal to the size 
of the area on the surface of the sphere, A, divided by the square of the radius, r, of that sphere:
 w=A
r2. (4.4)
The value of a solid angle is given in steradian. A sphere of radius r and surface of 4 πr2 will 
contain 4 π steradians. The steradian is a dimensionless quantity.
A surface can be described as a continuum of infinitesimal points, each occupying an infinitesi -
mal area, d A,
 ddw=A
r2, (4.5)
where d ω is the differential solid angle of the elemental cone containing a ray of light that is arriv -
ing at or leaving a infinitesimal surface d A. The symbol d stands for differential, the operator that 
reduces the applied variable to an infinitesimal quantity.
Most radiometric measurements do not require an accurate calculation of the spherical surface 
area. Flat area estimates can be substituted for spherical area when the solid angle is less than 0.03 
steradians, resulting in an error of <1%. This roughly translates to a distance at least 5 times greater 182 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthan the largest dimension of the detector. When the light source is the sun, flat area estimates can 
be substituted for a spherical area.
RADIANT ENERGY
Light is radiant energy. When light is absorbed by a physical object, its energy is converted into 
some other form. Visible light causes an electric current to flow in a light detector when its radiant 
energy is transferred to the electrons as kinetic energy.
Radiant energy (denoted as Q) is measured in joules (J).
SPECTRAL RADIANT ENERGY
A broadband source such as the sun emits electromagnetic radiation throughout most of the electro -
magnetic spectrum. However, most of its radiant energy is concentrated within the PAR. A single-
wavelength laser, on the other hand, is a monochromatic source; all of its radiant energy is emitted 
at one specific wavelength.
From this, we can define spectral radiant energy, which is the amount of radiant energy per unit 
wavelength interval at wavelength λ and is defined as
 QQ
ll=d
d. (4.6)
Spectral radiant energy is measured in joules per nanometer (J nm−1).
RADIANT FLUX (RADIANT POWER)
Energy per unit time is power, which we measure in joules per second (J s−1), or watts (W). Light 
“flows” through space and so radiant power is more commonly referred to as the flow rate of radiant 
energy with respect to time or radiant flux. It is defined as
 Φ=d
dQ
t, (4.7)
where Q is the radiant energy and t the time.
In terms of a light detector measuring PAR, the instantaneous magnitude of the electric current 
is directly proportional to the radiant flux. The total amount of current measured over a period of 
time is directly proportional to the radiant energy absorbed by the light detector during that time.
For phycological purpose, radiant flux is expressed also as μmol of photons per second.
SPECTRAL RADIANT FLUX (SPECTRAL RADIANT POWER)
Spectral radiant flux at wavelength λ is radiant flux per unit wavelength interval. It is defined as

RADIANT FLUX DENSITY (IRRADIANCE AND RADIANT EXITANCE)
Radiant flux density is the radiant flux per unit area at a point on a surface. Radiant flux density is 
measured in watts per square meter (W m−2).183 Working with Light
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThere are two possible conditions. The flux can be arriving at the surface in which case the radi -
ant flux density is referred to as irradiance. Irradiance is defined as
 EA=d
dΦ, (4.9)
where Φ is the radiant flux arriving at the infinitesimal area d A.
Since irradiance is the radiant flux per unit area, it can be expressed as mole of photons per area 
per unit time ( μmol m−2 s−1). Modern instruments measure in situ  irradiance directly in these units.
The flux can also be leaving the surface due to emission or reflection. The radiant flux density 
is referred to as radiant exitance. As with irradiance, the flux can leave in any direction above the 
surface. The definition of radiant exitance is
 MA=d
dΦ, (4.10)
where Φ is the radiant flux leaving the infinitesimal area d A.

RADIANCE
Imagine a ray of light arriving at or leaving a point on a surface in a given direction. Radiance is 
simply the amount of radiant flux contained in this ray (a cone of solid angle d ω). If the ray inter -
sects a surface at an angle θ with the normal to that surface, and the area of intersection with the 
surface has an infinitesimal cross-sectional area d A, the cross-sectional area of the ray is d A cos θ. 
The radiance of this ray is
 LA=d

wqcos.
 (4.13)
Radiance is measured in watts per square meter per steradian (W m−2 sr−1).184 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCUnlike radiant flux density, the definition of radiance does not distinguish between flux that 
arrives at or leaves a surface.
Another way of looking at radiance is to note that the radiant flux density at a point on a sur -
face due to a single ray of light arriving (or leaving) at an angle θ to the normal to that surface is 
dΦ/dA cos θ. The radiance at that point for the same angle is then d2Φ/(dA dω cos θ), or radiant 
flux density per unit solid angle.
The irradiance, E, at any distance from a uniform extended area source is related to the radiance, 
L, of the source by the following relationship, which depends only on the subtended central viewing 
angle, θ, of the radiance detector:
 EL=pqsin( ).22/ (4.14)
Radiance is independent of distance for an extended area source, because the sampled area 
increases with distance, cancelling inverse square losses. The inverse square law defines the rela -
tionship between the irradiance from a point source and the distance d. It states that the intensity 
per unit area is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. In other words, if you measure 
16 W m−2 at 1 m, you will measure 4 W m−2 at 2 m, and can likewise calculate the irradiance at any 
other distance. The following alternate form is often more convenient:

RADIANT INTENSITY
We can imagine a small point source of light that emits radiant flux in every direction. The amount 
of radiant flux emitted in a given direction can be represented by a ray of light contained in an 
elemental cone. This gives us the definition of radiant intensity:

PHOTOMETRY
Photometry is the science of measuring visible light in units that are weighted according to the 
sensitivity of the human eye. It is a quantitative science based on a statistical model of the human 
visual response to light under carefully controlled conditions. We cannot apply this model to the 
“perception” of light by algae, since we should substitute the sensitivity of the algal photoreception 
systems for that of the human eye.
For the human perception, the CIE (Commission International d’Eclairage) photometric curves 
(photopic and scotopic) provide a weighting function that can be used to convert radiometric into 
photometric measurements. In a scotopic curve, yellowish-green light receives the greatest weight 
because it stimulates the eye more than blue or red light of equal radiant power ( λmax = 555 nm) 
(Figure 4.9 and Table 4.3), whereas in a photopic curve blue-green light receives the greatest weight 
because it stimulates the eye more than other lights of equal radiant power ( λmax = 507 nm) (Figure 
4.9 and Table 4.3). For algae, action spectroscopy may be used for a similar purpose even though the 
spectra so far measured are contradictory, not very accurate, and very often are difficult to interpret 
(Figure 4.9).
LUMINOUS FLUX (LUMINOUS POWER)
Luminous flux is radiant flux weighted to match the eye response of the “standard observer.” Its 
unit of measurement is the lumen. The lumen (lm) is the photometric equivalent of the watt and is 
defined as 1/683 watts of radiant power at a frequency of 540 × 1012 Hz, or better at a wavelength 
of 555  nm.
LUMINOUS INTENSITY
The luminous intensity is the luminous flux emitted from a point source per unit solid angle into 
a given direction. The luminous intensity is measured in candela (the Latin word for “candle”). 
Together with the CIE photometric curve, the candela provides the weighting factor needed to 
convert between radiometric and photometric measurements. The candela (cd) is the luminous 
intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation with a frequency of 
540 × 1012 Hz ( λ = 555 nm) and has a radiant intensity of 1/683 W sr −1 in that direction.186 Algae

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCIf a light source is isotropic, that is, its intensity does not vary with direction, then the relation -
ship between lumens and candelas is 1 cd = 4π lm. In other words, an isotropic source having a 
luminous intensity of 1 candela emits 4 π lumens into space, which just happens to be 4 π steradians. 
We can also state that 1 cd = 1 lm sr, analogous to the equivalent radiometric definition. If a source 
is not isotropic, the relationship between candelas and lumens is empirical. A fundamental method 
used to determine the total flux (lumens) is to measure the luminous intensity (candelas) in many 
directions using a goniophotometer, and then numerically integrate over the entire sphere. Since 1 
steradian has a projected area of 1 m2 at a distance of 1 m, a 1 cd light source will duly produce 1 
lm m-2 (Figure 4.10).

LUMINOUS ENERGY
Luminous energy is photometrically weighted radiant energy. It is measured in lumen per second 
(lm s−1).
LUMINOUS FLUX DENSITY (ILLUMINANCE AND LUMINOUS EXITANCE)
Luminous flux density is photometrically weighted radiant flux density. Illuminance is the photo -
metric equivalent of irradiance, whereas luminous exitance is the photometric equivalent of radiant 
exitance.
Luminous flux density is measured in lux (lx) or lumens per square meter (lm m−2).
Typical Values for Illuminance (in lux)
Sunlight 100,000
Skylight 10,000
Overcast daylight 1000
Moonlight 0.1
Starlight 0.01.
LUMINANCE
Luminance is photometrically weighted radiance. In terms of visual perception, we perceive lumi -
nance. It is an approximate measure of how “bright” a surface appears when we view it from a 
given direction. Luminance used to be called “photometric brightness.” Luminance is measured in 
lumens per square meter per steradian (lm m−2 sr −1).
LAMBERTIAN SURFACES
A Lambertian surface is referred to as a perfectly diffusing surface, which adheres to Lambert’s 
cosine law. This law states that the reflected or transmitted luminous intensity in any direction from 
an element of a Lambertian surface varies as the cosine of the angle between that direction and the 
normal of the surface. The intensity Iθ of each ray leaving the surface at an angle θ from the ray in 
a direction perpendicular to the surface ( In) is given by
 IIq q =ncos. (4.22)
Therefore, even if the luminous intensity decrease with a factor cos θ from the normal, the pro -
jected surface decreases with the same factor; as a consequence, the radiance (luminance) of a 
Lambertian surface is the same regardless of the viewing angle, and is given by

the radiance is π and not 2 π:

 (4.24)
This equation can be easily derived. Suppose we place an infinitesimal Lambertian emitter d A 
on the inner surface of an imaginary sphere S. The inverse square law (Equation 4.15) provides the 
irradiance E at any point P on the inner surface of the sphere. However, d = D cos θ, where D is the

This is interesting. From the definition of irradiance (Equation 4.9), we know that Φ = EA for 
constant flux density across a finite surface area A. Since the area A of the surface of a sphere with 
radius r is given by
 Ar D ==422pp , (4.27)

Determining the luminous flux from a source radiating over a spectrum is more difficult. It is neces -
sary to determine the spectral power distribution for the particular source. Once that is done, it is nec -
essary to calculate the luminous flux at each wavelength or at regular intervals for continuous spectra. 
Adding up the flux at each wavelength gives a total flux produced by a source in the visible spectrum.
A standard incandescent lamp produces a continuous spectrum in the visible region, and various 
intervals must be used to determine the luminous flux. For sources like a mercury vapor lamp, however, 
it is slightly easier. Mercury emits light primarily in a line spectrum. It emits radiant flux at six primary 
wavelengths. This makes it easier to determine the luminous flux of this lamp versus the incandescent.
Generally, it is not necessary to determine the luminous flux for yourself. It is commonly given 
for a lamp based on laboratory testing during manufacture. For instance, the luminous flux for a 
100-W incandescent lamp is approximately 1700 lm. We can use this information to extrapolate 
the flux for similar lamps. Thus, the average luminous efficacy for an incandescent lamp is about 
17 lm W−1. We can now use this as an approximation for similar incandescent sources at various 
wattages.

conversion between lux and lumens.
If you measure 22.0 lux from a light bulb at a distance of 3.162 m, how much light, in lumens, is

Based on steradian definition (Equation 4.4), we know that 1 sr cuts off a spherical sur -
face area of 1 m2 at a distance of 1 m from the source. Therefore, 220 lm m−2 corresponds to 
220 lm sr −1. The solid angle of the lamp is equal to 2 πh r −1 (Equation 4.4), where h is the height 
of the spherical calotte and corresponds to 2 π [1–cos(360  − 30/2)]  = 12.35 sr, while the shad -
owed solid angle corresponds to 0.21 sr. Therefore, the total lumen output will be 220 lm sr −1 
12.35 sr = 2717 lm (Figure 4.11).
PAR DETECTORS
Photosynthetic irradiance is the radiant flux density of PAR and is expressed as the radiant energy 
(400–700 nm) incident on a unit of surface per unit time. A PAR detector is typically an irradi -
ance detector that is equally sensitive to light between 400 and 750 nm and insensitive to light 
outside this region. Irradiance is now internationally expressed in moles of photons per unit area 
and per unit time as μmol m−2 s−1 (formerly μEinsten  m−2 s−1), where 1 μmol ( μEinsten) corresponds 
to 1 micromole of photons, that is, 6.02 × 1017 photons, at a given wavelength. Modern instruments 
measure in situ  irradiance flux densities directly in μmol m−2 s−1.
In terms of collector geometry, a PAR detector is usually equipped with either a planar (cosine) 
or a spherical (scalar) collector. A planar or 2 π collector measures PAR in a 180° arc, while a spheri -
cal or 4 π collector measures the light impinging from all directions on a single point (Figure 4.12).
The irradiance impinging on the surface of the water or sediment is commonly measured with 
a planar detector. Spherical detectors provide a measurement of the amount of light available for

collector, whereas algae resemble small spherical collectors.
Direct solar radiation reaching the water surface varies with the angular height of the radiation 
and therefore, with time of day, season, and latitude. The quantity and quality of light also vary 
with the molecular transparency of the atmosphere and the distance the light must travel through 
it; therefore, it varies with altitude and meteorological conditions. In water, upwelling (bottom-
reflected radiance) and downwelling (depth-attenuated radiance) irradiance are usually quantified 
using paired cosine collectors mounted on a frame that is lowered in the water column. Spherical 
collectors are also mounted on a frame and lowered into the water to obtain light profiles. For pho -
tophysiological studies, spherical collectors provide a realistic measure of the total amount of PAR 
available for photosynthesis in a water body.
Accurate measurement of photosynthetic radiation is essential for controlled environmental 
research. The most common method of measuring PAR gives equal value, that is, equal energy 
content, to all photons with wavelength between 400 and 750 nm and is referred to as the photosyn -
thetic photon flux (PPF) measured in μmol m−2 s−1. The ideal PPF sensor would respond equally to 
all photons between 400 and 750 nm. However, photosynthesis is also driven by photons with wave -
length below 400 nm and above 750 nm, and photons of different wavelength induce an unequal 
amount of photosynthesis. For these reasons, an accurate measurement of PAR should follow the 
relative quantum efficiency (RQE) curve, which weights the photosynthetic value of all photons 
with wavelength from 360 to 760 nm. The RQE resembles the absorption spectrum of the absorbing 
algal structures. A sensor that responds according to this curve measures yield photon flux (YPF) 
in micromoles per square meter per second, the same unit of PPF.
Detectors designed to measure YPF or PPF are commercially available. Both types consist of 
an optical diffuser collector (planar or spherical) and multiple spectral filters in front of a broad-
spectrum photovoltaic detector.
Planar detectors measure only unreflected sunlight. They should possess cosine-corrected 
response; since the light impinging on the measurement plane is proportional to the cosine of the 
angle at which the light is incident, the response of the detector must also be proportional to the 
2π4π
FIGURE 4.12  Examples of PAR detectors equipped with a planar 2 π collector or with a spherical 4 π 
collector.193 Working with Light
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCcosine of the incidence angle (see Equation 4.22). An integrating sphere measures both unreflected 
and all the scattered sunlight; it needs no correction since it is the ideal cosine detector, responding 
equally to light coming from all directions.
The peak responsivity and bandwidth of a detector can be controlled through the use of filters. 
Filters can suppress out-of-band light but cannot boost signal and can restrict the spatial responsiv -
ity of the detector. Filters operate either by absorption or by interference. Colored glass filters are 
doped with materials that selectively absorb light by wavelength and obey the Lambert–Beer law. 
The peak transmission is inherent to the additives, while bandwidth is dependent on thickness. 
Interference filters, which select very narrow bandwidths, rely on thin layers of dielectric to cause 
constructive interference between the wavefronts of the incident white light. So, by varying filter 
thickness, we can selectively modify the spectral responsivity of a detector to match a particular 
function. Pass-band filters are often used to select a specific wavelength radiation. Any of these filter 
types can be combined to form a composite filter that matches a particular photobiological process. 
Multiple filters cemented in layers give a net transmission equal to the product of the individual 
transmissions. The detector’s overall spectral sensitivity is equal to the product of the responsivity 
of the detector and the transmission of the filters. Given a desired overall sensitivity and known 
detector responsivity, we can then solve for the ideal filter transmission curve.
Different measurement geometries necessitate specialized input optics. Radiance and luminance 
measurements require a narrow viewing angle ( <4°) in order to satisfy the conditions underlying the 
measurement units. Power measurements, on the other hand, require a uniform response to radia -
tion regardless of input angle to capture all the light.
THE PHOTOSYNTHESIS–IRRADIANCE RESPONSE CURVE ( P vs. E CURVE)
The P versus E curve or the light-response curve shows how photosynthetic rate varies with increas -
ing irradiance. The rate of photosynthesis can be measured as net O2 evolution or as carbon fixa -
tion per chlorophyll a units, measured as mg C * (mg chlorophyll a)−1 h−1. This curve describes a 
complex multistep process that depends upon several limiting factors. Three regions are present 
in the curve: a light-limited region, a light-saturated region, and a light-inhibited region. The basic 
description of the P–E curves requires a nonlinear mathematical function to account for the light 
saturation effects. Quite a few such functions have been employed with varying degrees of success, 
such as rectangular hyperbola, and quadratic, exponential, and hyperbolic tangent.
In our opinion, the rectangular hyperbolic function such as the Michaelis–Menten formulation 
that describes the nutrient uptake kinetics is quite suitable to describe the dynamic relationship 
between photosynthetic rate and irradiance, though the Michaelis–Menten formulation shows 
a much less sharper transition from the limited region to the saturated region. The P–E curve 
(without the light-inhibited) region can be described with the following rectangular hyperbolic 
function:
 PPE

where PE is the photosynthetic rate at any irradiance E, Eλ the spectral irradiance (in μmol m−2 s−1) 
and Km is the half-saturation constant when PE = Pmax/2 (Figure 4.13a).
In the light-limited region, that is, at low irradiance levels, the rate of photon absorption deter -
mines the rate of steady-state electron transport from H2O to CO2. In the light-limited region, the 
available light is insufficient to support the maximum potential rate of the light-dependent reactions 
and thus limits the overall rate of photosynthesis. In this region, PE can be described as
 PEE=la, (4.31)194 Algae

solar energy is converted into chemical energy. α represents the slope of the P vs E curve at low 
light levels, that is, the initial linear part of the curve estimated as
 ()mg chlorophyll hm olms a−− −− 11 21µ
α takes into account that the light absorbed by the algal cell is proportional to the functional absorp -
tion cross-section ( σPSII) of the PSII (the effective area that a molecule presents to an incoming 
photon and that is proportional to the probability of absorption) and to the number of photosynthetic

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCEquation 4.31 shows that the photosynthetic rate is linearly proportional to irradiance at low 
irradiance levels. The greater the slope ( α), the more efficient is the photosynthetic process (Figure 
4.13b). By keeping the number of photosynthetic units constant but increasing the functional absorp -
tion cross-section the slope will increase. The slope can be normalized to chlorophyll biomass and, 
if so, a superscript “B” is added to denote this normalization: αB. In this case, the curve dimensions 
are O2 evolved (or C fixed) per unit chlorophyll a and quanta per unit area.
At very low irradiance level, the rate of oxygen consumption will be greater than the rate of 
oxygen evolution; hence, respiration is greater than photosynthesis and net oxygen evolution will 
be negative. Therefore, the P–E curve does not pass through the origin. The irradiance value on 
the X-axis at which photosynthesis balances respiration is called the light compensation point ( Ec). 
Therefore, Equation 4.30 becomes

l  (4.33)
This phenomenon (chlororespiration) is more pronounced in cyanobacteria, where the photo -
synthetic and respiratory pathways share common electron carriers (cytochromes). The irradiance 
levels needed to reach the compensation point ( EC) are about 10 μmol m−2 s−1 for shallow water, but 
are much lower in dim habitats.
As irradiance increases, more ATP and NADPH are produced, and the overall rate of photosyn -
thesis becomes increasingly nonlinear rising towards its maximum or saturation level, Pmax (light-
saturated photosynthesis per unit of chlorophyll a). This pattern will continue until some other 
factors become limiting. By definition, in the light-saturated region, the rate of photon absorption 
exceeds the rate of steady-state electron transport from H2O to CO2. Saturating irradiance, EK, is 
defined at the point at which the extrapolated initial slope crosses Pmax:
 EP
K=max

EK represents an optimum on the photosynthesis irradiance curve.
Light-saturated photosynthetic rate is independent of the functional absorption cross-section of 
the photosynthetic apparatus and is related only to the number of photosynthetic unit ( n) and its 
steady-state electron turnover rate through the PSII reaction center (1/ τPSII):
 Pnmax . =


tPSII (4.35)
This equation says that increasing the number of photosynthetic units (but not their size) Pmax, 
that is, the saturation level, increases, and that Pmax cannot be derived from measurements of light 
absorption (Figure 4.13c). In other words, above the saturation point ( EK), the light-dependent reac -
tion is producing more ATP and NADPH than that can be used by the light-independent reaction for 
CO2 fixation, that is, increasing irradiance no longer causes any increase in the photosynthetic rate. 
Above EK and under normal condition, availability of CO2 is the limiting factor, since the concentra -
tion of CO2 in the atmosphere is very low (0.035%, v/v).
Saturating irradiances show some correlation with habitat, but generally, they are low com -
pared with full sun. Intertidal species require 400–600 μmol m−2 s−1 (ca. 10% of the full sun irradi -
ance), upper and midsublittoral species 150–250 μmol m−2 s−1 and deep sublittoral species less than 
100 μmol m−2 s−1. Diatoms under ice, saturate at 5 μmol m−2 s−1.
Further increase in irradiance beyond light saturation can lead to a reduction in the photosyn -
thetic rate from the maximum saturation level. This reduction, which is dependent on both the 196 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCirradiance and the duration of the exposure, is often termed photoinhibition. Photoinhibition can be 
thought as a modification of Pmax either by a reduction in the number of photosynthetic units or by 
an increase in the maximum turnover rate (Equation 4.35); thus, photoinhibition leads to a reduc -
tion in the photochemical efficiency of PSII, through a reduction in the population of functional (O2 
evolving) reaction centers. Increasing irradiance levels increase the probability that more than one 
photon, two, for example, strike the same reaction centers at the same time. The added energies of 
two blue photons, for example, could be very harmful since the resulting energy will correspond to 
a UV photon and could damage the chromophores.
PHOTOACCLIMATION
Photoacclimation is a complex light response that changes cellular activities on many time scales.
The aquatic environment presents a highly variable irradiance ( E) field with changes occurring 
over a wide range of time scales. For example, changes in E on short time scales can result from 
focusing and defocusing of radiation by waves at the surface. Longer time-scale changes can result 
from variable cloud cover or turbulent motion that transports phytoplankton across the exponential 
E gradient of the surface mixed layer. In a well-mixed surface layer, phytoplankton experiences long 
periods of low E interspersed by short periods of saturating or even supersaturating E. The diurnal 
solar cycle causes changes in E on even longer time scales. To cope with the highly variable radia -
tion environment, phytoplankton has developed numerous strategies to optimize photosynthesis, 
while minimizing susceptibility to photodamage. Photosynthetic acclimation to E over time scales 
of hours to days proceeds through changes in cellular pigmentation or structural characteristics, for 
example, size and number of photosynthetic units. On shorter time scales, cells adjust photon uti -
lization efficiencies by changing the distribution of harvested energy between photosystems (state 
transitions) or by dissipating excess energy through nonphotochemical processes, for example, xan -
thophyll cycle or photoinhibition.
Therefore, photoacclimation involves change in the macromolecular composition in the photo -
synthetic apparatus. It is relatively easy to observe acclimation in unicellular algae and seaweeds, 
where chlorophylls per cell or per unit surface area can increase five-to-ten-fold as irradiance 
decrease. The response is not a linear function of irradiance; rather at extremely low light lev -
els, cells often become a bit chlorotic, and on exposure to slightly higher (but still low) irradi -
ance, chlorophyll reaches the maximum. Increase in irradiance leads to a decrease in the cellular 
complement of chlorophylls until a minimum value is reached. The absolute irradiance levels 
that induce this effect are species-specific and chlorotic response is not universal. The changes in 
pigmentation resulting from photoacclimation have profound consequences for light absorption 
properties of the cells. First, cells acclimated to high irradiance levels generally have high carot -
enoid concentration relative to chlorophyll a. Carotenoids such as β-carotene and zeaxanthin 
do not transfer excitation energy to the reaction centers and consequently act to screen the cell 
from excess light. Some xantophylls such as lutein transfer excitation energy but with reduced 
efficiency, and therefore effectively reduce the functional absorption cross-section of the asso -
ciated photosystem. Because these carotenoids absorb light without a concomitant increase in 
the functional cross-section of PSII, organisms acclimated to high irradiance levels often have 
lower maximum quantum yield of photosynthetic O2 evolution. Second, when cells acclimate to 
low irradiance levels, the subsequent increase in pigmentation is associated with a decrease in 
functional optical absorption section normalized to chlorophyll a. This effect is due primarily to 
the self-shading of the chromophores between layers of thylakoids membranes and is inversely 
proportional to the number of membranes in the chloroplast, that is, the more the membranes, 
the lower is the optical cross-section. Thus, as cells accumulate chlorophyll, each chlorophyll 
molecule becomes less effective in light absorption; a doubling of cellular chlorophyll does not 
produce a doubling in the rate of light absorption. The reduction in the chlorophyll-specific opti -
cal absorption cross-section can be visualized considering the fate of photons incident on two 197 Working with Light
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCstacks of thylakoid membranes: one is a thin stack from a cell acclimated to high irradiance levels 
and the second is a thick stack from a cell acclimated to low irradiance levels. The probability of 
a photon passing through a thick stack of membranes without being absorbed is small compared 
with a thin stack of membranes. This so-called “package effect” reduces the effectiveness of 
increased pigmentation in harvesting light and has important implications for the capital costs of 
light harvesting, that is, the investments in the physical structures of the organism required for 
the metabolic processes. The diminution in the optical absorption cross-section with increased 
chlorophyll is also a function of cell size: the larger the cell, the more important this effect. At 
some point, a cell is, for most practical purposes, optically black, and further increases in pigment 
levels confer no advantage in light absorption.
There are two basic photoacclimation responses in algae. In one, acclimation is accomplished 
primarily by changes in the number of photosynthetic reaction centers, while the effective absorp -
tion cross-section of the reaction centers remains relatively constant. The second is characterized 
by relatively large changes in the functional size of the antennae serving the reaction centers, while 
the number of reaction centers remains relatively constant. Complementary changes in either of the 
responses produce the same effect on the initial slope of the photosynthesis-irradiance curve. As 
the functional size of the antenna serving PSII, and not the number of reaction centers, determines 
the light-saturation parameter, organisms that vary the cross-section would tend to have more con -
trol over this parameter, as long as the turnover time remains constant.

Biogeochemical Role of Algae
THE ROLE OF ALGAE IN BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
Biogeochemical cycling can be defined as the movement and exchanging of both matter and energy 
between the four different components of the earth, namely the atmosphere (the air envelope that 
surrounds the earth), the hydrosphere (includes all the earth’s water that is found in streams, lakes, 
seas, soil, groundwater, and air), the lithosphere (the solid inorganic portion of the earth, includ -
ing the soil, sediments, and rock that forms the crust and upper mantle, and extends about 80-km 
deep), and the biosphere (all the living organisms, plants, and animals). The four spheres are not 
mutually exclusive, but overlap and intersect in a quite dynamic way. Soils contain air and exchange 
gases with the atmosphere, thus causing the geosphere and atmosphere to overlap; but as they also 
contain water, the geosphere and hydrosphere too overlap. Dust from the geosphere and water from 
the hydrosphere occur in the atmosphere. Organisms are present in water bodies, soils, aquifers, 
and the atmosphere, so the biosphere overlaps with the other three spheres. Chemical elements are 
cyclically transferred within and among the four spheres, with the total mass of the elements in all 
of the spheres being conserved, though chemical transformations can change their form.
The biogeochemical cycle of any element describes pathways which are commensurate with the 
movement of the biologically available form of that element throughout the biosphere (where the 
term “biological availability” is used to infer the participation of a substance in a “biological” reac -
tion as opposed to its simple presence in biota).
The most efficient cycles are often equated with a high atmospheric abundance of the element. 
These cycles ensure a rapid turnover of the element and have the flexibility to process the element in 
a number of different forms or phases (i.e., solid, liquid, and gaseous). Except in a few rare but inter -
esting situations (e.g., geothermal/tectonic systems), all biogeochemical cycles are driven directly 
or indirectly by the radiant energy of the sun. Energy is absorbed, converted, temporarily stored, 
and eventually dissipated, essentially in a one-way process (which is fundamental to all ecosystem 
function). In contrast to energy flow, materials undergo cyclic conversions. Through geologic time, 
biogeochemical cycling processes have fundamentally altered the conditions on earth in a unidirec -
tional manner, most crucially by decomposition of abiotically formed organic matter on the primi -
tive earth by early heterotrophic forms of life, or changing the originally reducing atmosphere to 
an oxidized one via the evolution of oxygenic phototrophs. Contemporary biogeochemical cycles, 
however, tend to be cycling rather than unidirectional, leading to dynamic equilibria between vari -
ous forms of cycled materials.
Like all organisms, algae provide biogeochemical as well as ecological services; that is, they 
function to link metabolic sequences and properties to form a continuous, self-perpetuating net -
work of chemical element fluxes. They have played key roles in shaping earth’s biogeochemistry 
and contemporary human economy, and these roles are becoming ever more significant as human 
impacts on ecosystems result in massive alteration of biogeochemical cycling of chemical elements. 
Just think about the earth’s initial atmosphere, 80% N2, 10% CO/CO2, 10% H2 (by volume): no free 
O2 appeared until the development of oxygenic photosynthesis by cyanobacteria, transforming the 
atmosphere composition in the actual 78% N2, 21% O2, 0.036% CO2, and other minor gases (by 
volume). Or the petroleum and natural gas we consume as fuels, plastics, dyes, etc. in our everyday 
life; these fossilized hydrocarbons are mostly formed by the deposition of organic matter consist -
ing of the remains of several freshwater marine microalgae from the classes Eustigmatophyceae, 5200 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCDinophyceae, and Chlorophyceae. These remains contain bacterially and chemically resistant, 
high aliphatic biopolymers (algaenans) and long-chain hydrocarbons that are selectively preserved 
upon sedimentation and diagenesis and make a significant contribution to kerogens, a source of 
petroleum under appropriate geochemical condition. Moreover, we are still using the remains of 
calcareous microorganisms, deposited over millions of years in ancient ocean basins, for building 
material. Diatomaceous oozes are mined as addictives for reflective paints, polishing materials, 
abrasives, and for insulation. The fossil organic carbon, skeletal remains, and oxygen are the cumu -
lative remains of algae export production that has occurred uninterrupted for more than 3 billion 
years in the upper ocean.
99.9% of the biomass of algae is accounted for by six major elements such as carbon (C), oxygen 
(O), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P), plus calcium (Ca), potassium (K), 
sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and silicon (Si). The remaining elements 
occur chiefly as trace elements, because they are needed only in catalytic quantities.
All elements that become incorporated into organic material are eventually recycled, but on 
different time scales. The process of transforming organic materials back to inorganic forms of 
elements is generally referred to as mineralization. It takes place throughout the water column as 
well as on the bottom of water bodies (lakes, streams, and seas), where much of the detrital mate -
rial from overlying waters eventually accumulates. Recycling of minerals may take place relatively 
rapidly (within a season) in the euphotic zone (i.e., the portion of water column supporting net 
primary production), or much more slowly (over geological time) in the case of refractory materi -
als which sink and accumulate on the seabed. In the water column, where there is usually plenty 
of oxygen, decomposition of organic material takes place via oxidative degradation through the 
action of heterotrophic bacteria. Carbon dioxide and nutrients are returned for re-utilization by the 
phytoplankton. Ecologically, the most important aspect of recycling in the water bodies is the rate 
at which growth-limiting nutrients are recycled. Among the nutrients that can be in short supply, 
nitrate ( NO3−), iron (bioavailable Fe), phosphate ( PO43−), and dissolved silicon (Si(OH)4) are most 
often found in concentration well below the half-saturation levels required for the maximum phy -
toplankton growth. In particular, algae are important for the biogeochemical cycling of the chemi -
cal elements they uptake, assimilate, and produce such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, 
silicon, and sulfur.
We will now briefly consider some of the aspects of these elements in relation to biosynthesis 
and photosynthesis.
LIMITING NUTRIENTS
Among the elements required for algal growth, there are some that can become limiting factors. The 
original notion of limitation was introduced by von Liebig more than a century ago to establish a 
correlation between the yield of a crop and the elemental composition of the substrate required for 
the synthesis of that crop. Von Liebig stated that if one crop nutrient is missing or deficient, plant 
growth will be poor, even if the other elements are abundant. That nutrient will be defined “limiting 
nutrient.” This concept has become to be known as Liebig’s “Law of the Minimum.” Simply stated, 
Liebig’s law means that growth is controlled not by the total of nutrients available but by the nutri -
ent available in the smallest quantity with respect to the requirements of the plant. Liebig likens the 
potential of a crop to a barrel with staves of unequal length. The capacity of this barrel is limited by 
the length of the shortest stave and can only be increased by lengthening that stave. When that stave 
is lengthened, another one becomes the limiting factor.
The concentration of a nutrient will give some indication whether or not the nutrient is a limiting 
factor, but the nutrient’s supply rate or turnover time is more important in determining the magni -
tude or degree of limitation. For example, if the concentration of a nutrient is a limiting factor, but 
the supply rate is slightly less than the uptake rate by the algae, then the algae will only be slightly 
nutrient-limited. Not all the algae are limited by the same nutrient, but it occurs at the species level, 201 Biogeochemical Role of Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCfor example, all the diatoms are limited by silicate. Moreover, there is a considerable variation in 
the degree, kind, and seasonality of nutrient limitation, which is related not only to variations in 
riverine input, but also to conditions and weather in the outflow area.
In general, growth rate of a population of organisms would be proportional to the uptake rate of 
that one limiting factor. Nutrient-limited growth is usually modeled with a Monod (or Michaelis–
Menten) equation:
 mm=+max[]
[]LN
LN Km (5.1)
where μ is the specific growth rate of population as a function of [LN], [LN] is the concentration 
of limiting nutrient, μmax is the maximum population growth rate (at “optimal” conditions), and Km 
is the Monod coefficient, also called the half-saturation coefficient because it corresponds to the 
concentration at which μ is one-half of its maximum. When the concentration of limiting nutrient 
[LN] equals Km, the population growth rate is μmax/2.
As [LN] increases, μ increases and so the algal population (number of cells) increases. Beyond 
a certain [LN], μ tends asymptotically to its maximum ( μmax), and the population tends to its maxi -
mum yield. If this concentration is not maintained, primary productivity returns to a level com -
parable to that prior to the nutrient enrichment rapidly. This productivity variation is the seasonal 
blooming. Normal becomes abnormal when there is a continuous over-stimulation of the system by 
excess supply of one or more limiting nutrients, which leads to intense and prolonged algal blooms 
throughout the year. The continuous nutrient supply sustains a constant maximum algal growth rate 
(μmax). Therefore, instead of peaks of normal blooms, followed by periods when phytoplankton is 
less noticeable, we have a continuous primary production. When this occurs, we refer to it as eutro -
phication. In this process, the enhanced primary productivity triggers various physical, chemical, 
and biological changes in autotroph and heterotroph communities, as well as changes in processes 
in and on the bottom sediments and changes in the level of oxygen supply to surface water and 
oxygen consumption in deep waters. Eutrophication is considered to be a natural aging process for 
lakes and some estuaries, and it is one of the ways in which a water body (lake, rivers, and seas) 
transforms from a state where nutrients are scarce (oligotrophic), through a slightly richer phase 
(mesotrophic) to an enriched state (eutrophic).
Eutrophication can result in a series of undesirable effects. Excessive growth of planktonic algae 
increases the amount of organic matter settling to the bottom. This may be enhanced by changes 
in the species composition and functioning of the pelagic food web by stimulating the growth of 
small flagellates rather than larger diatoms, which leads to lower grazing by copepods and increased 
sedimentation. In areas with stratified water masses, the increase in oxygen consumption can lead 
to oxygen depletion and changes in community structure or death of the benthic fauna. Bottom 
dwelling fish may either die or escape. Eutrophication can also promote the risk of harmful algal 
blooms that may cause discoloration of the water, foam formation, death of benthic fauna and wild 
or caged fish, or shellfish poisoning of humans. Increased growth and dominance of fast growing 
filamentous macroalgae in shallow sheltered areas is yet another effect of nutrient overload which 
will change the coastal ecosystem, increase the risk of local oxygen depletion, and reduce biodiver -
sity and nurseries for fish.
Human activities can greatly accelerate eutrophication by increasing the rate at which nutrients 
and organic substances enter aquatic ecosystems from their surrounding watersheds, for example, 
introducing in the water bodies detergents and fertilizers very rich in phosphorus. The resultant 
aging, which occurs through anthropogenic activity, is termed cultural eutrophication.
Globally, nitrogen and phosphorus are the two elements that immediately limit, in a Liebig sense, 
the growth of photosynthetic organisms. Silicon could also become a more generally limiting nutri -
ent, particularly for diatom growth. These nutrients are present in algal cells in a species-specific 
structural ratio, the so-called Redfield ratio , which determines the nutrient requirement of the 202 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCspecies, and the value of which depends on the conditions under which species grow and compete. 
Consequently, the species composition of an environment will be determined not only by nutrient 
availability, but also by their proper relationship, since changes in nutrient ratio cause shifts in phy -
toplankton communities and subsequent trophic linkages. Nitrogen generally limits overall produc -
tivity in the marine system. Nitrogen limitation occurs most often at higher salinities and during low 
flow periods. However, since marine system is in stoichiometric balance, any nutrient can become 
a limiting factor. Phosphorus limitation occurs most often in freshwater system, in environments 
of intermediate salinities, and along the coasts during periods of high freshwater input. The occur -
rence of silicon limitation appears to be more spatially and temporally variable than phosphorus or 
nitrogen limitation and is more prevalent in spring than summer.
In the case of phosphorus, the limitation of algal growth can be at least twofold. First, there is 
limitation of nucleic acid synthesis. This limitation can be at the level of genome replication or at the 
level of RNA synthesis (a form of transcriptional control). The limitation can affect photosynthetic 
energy conversion by reducing the rate of synthesis of proteins in the photosynthetic apparatus, 
which is effectively a negative feedback on photosynthesis. This inhibition of protein synthesis may 
thus have effects on cell metabolism and oxidative stress similar to those for inhibition of protein 
synthesis under N limitation, except that the effect is indirect and less immediate. Secondly, a more 
immediate response to phosphorus limitation is on the rate of synthesis and regeneration of sub -
strates in the Calvin–Benson cycle, thereby reducing the rate of light utilization for carbon fixation. 
Cells can also undergo a decrease in membrane phospholipids; moreover, the inability to produce 
nucleic acids under P limitation limit cell division, leading to an increased cell volume.
On a biochemical level, nitrogen limitation directly influences the supply of amino acids, which 
in turn limits the translation of mRNA and hence reduces the rate of protein synthesis. Under nitro -
gen-limited conditions also, the efficiency of PSII decreases, primarily as a consequence of thermal 
dissipation of absorbed excitation energy in the pigment bed. This appears to be due mainly to a 
decrease in the number of PSII reaction centers relative to the antennae. The functional absorption 
cross-section of PSII increases under nitrogen-limiting conditions, while the probability of energy 
transfer between PSII reaction center decreases. From a structural point of view, the reaction cen -
ters behave as if they were energetically isolated with a significant portion of the light-harvesting 
antenna disconnected from the photochemical processes. As nitrogen limitation leads to a reduction 
of growth and photosynthetic rates, it also leads to a reduction in respiratory rates. The relation -
ship between the specific growth rate and specific respiration rate is linear with a positive intercept 
at zero growth, which is termed “maintenance respiration.” The molecular basis of the alterations 
is unclear; however, the demands for carbon skeletons and ATP, two of the major products of the 
respiratory pathways, are markedly reduced if protein synthesis is depressed.
The requirement for silicon for construction of the diatom frustule makes this group uniquely 
subject to silicate limitation. Since silicic acid uptake, silica (SiO2) frustule formation, and the cell 
division cycle are all tightly linked, under silica limitation, the diatom cell cycle predominantly 
stops at the G2 phase, before the completion of cell division. Thus, an inhibition of cell division 
linked to an inability to synthesize new cell-wall material under silicon limitation can lead to an 
increase in the volume per cell. This increase could also be partly explained by the formation of 
auxospores with a larger cell diameter.
ALGAE AND THE PHOSPHORUS CYCLE
The phosphorus cycle is the simplest of the biogeochemical cycles. Phosphorus is the eleventh-
most abundant mineral in the earth’s crust and does not exist in a gaseous state. Natural inorganic 
phosphorus deposits occur primarily as phosphate, that is, a phosphorous atom linked to four oxy -
gen atoms, in the mineral apatite. The heavy molecule of phosphate never makes its way into the 
atmosphere; it is always part of an organism, dissolved in water, or in the form of rock. Cycling 
processes of phosphorus are the same in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. When rock with 203 Biogeochemical Role of Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCphosphate is exposed to water (especially water with a little acid in it), the rock is weathered out and 
goes into solution. Autotrophs (algae and plants) assimilate this dissolved phosphorus up and alter 
it to organic phosphorus using it in a variety of ways. It is an important constituent of lipid portion 
of cell membranes, many coenzymes, DNA, RNA, and, of course ATP. Heterotrophs obtain their 
phosphorous from the autotrophs they eat. When heterotrophs and autotrophs die (or when hetero -
trophs defecate), the phosphate may be returned to the soil or water by the decomposers. There, it 
can be taken up by other autotrophs and used again. This cycle will occur again and again until 
at last the phosphorous is lost at the bottom of the deepest parts of the ocean, where it becomes 
part of the sedimentary rocks forming there. If the rock is brought to the surface and weathered, 
this phosphorous will be released. During the natural process of weathering, the rocks gradually 
release the phosphorus as phosphate ions that are soluble in water and the mineralized phosphate 
compounds breakdown. Phosphates PO43− are formed from this element. Phosphates exist in three 
forms: orthophosphate, metaphosphate (or polyphosphate), and organically bound phosphate, each 
compound containing phosphorous in a different chemical arrangement. These forms of phosphate 
occur in living and decaying plant and animal remains, as free ions or weakly chemically bounded 
in aqueous systems, chemically bounded to sediments and soils, or as mineralized compounds in 
soil, rocks, and sediments.
Orthophosphate forms are produced by natural processes, but major man-influenced sources 
include: partially treated and untreated sewage, runoff from agricultural sites, and application of 
some lawn fertilizers. Orthophosphate is readily available to the biological community and typi -
cally found in very low concentrations in unpolluted waters. Poly-forms are used for treating boiler 
waters and in detergents. In water, they are transformed into orthophosphate and made available for 
autotrophs uptake. The organic phosphate is the phosphate that is bound or tied up in autotrophs, 
waste solids, or other organic material. After decomposition, this phosphate can be converted to 
orthophosphate.
Algae and plants are the key elements to passing on phosphates to other living organisms, but 
their importance in phosphorus cycling is connected mainly to the impact of this element on their 
growth. As already remarked, both phosphorus and nitrogen are among the nutrients that can 
become limiting factors, and hence an overloading of these two elements leads to dramatic changes 
in the structure and functioning of an ecosystem.
Phosphorus, in the form of orthophosphate, is generally considered the main limiting nutrient 
in freshwater aquatic systems; that is, if all the phosphorus is used, autotroph growth will cease, no 
matter how much nitrogen is available. In phosphorus-limited systems, excess phosphorus will trig -
ger eutrophic condition. In these situations, the natural cycle of the nutrient becomes overwhelmed 
by excessive inputs, which appear to cause an imbalance in the “production versus consumption” 
of living material (biomass) in an ecosystem. The system then reacts by producing more phyto -
plankton/vegetation than can be consumed by ecosystem. This overproduction triggers the series of 
events determining the aging process of the water body.
Under aerobic conditions, as water plants and algae begin to grow more rapidly than normal, 
there is also an excess die off of the plants and algae as sunlight is blocked at lower levels. Bacteria 
try to decompose the organic waste, consuming oxygen, and releasing more phosphate which is 
known as “recycling” or “internal cycling.” Some of the phosphate may be precipitated as iron 
phosphate and stored in the sediment where it can then be released if anoxic conditions develop. In 
deeper environments, the phosphate may be stored in the sediments and then recycled through the 
natural process of lithophication, uplift, and erosion of rock formations. In anaerobic conditions, as 
conditions worsen as more phosphates and nitrates may be added to the water, all of the oxygen may 
be used up by bacteria in trying to decompose all of the waste. Different bacteria continue to carry 
on decomposition reactions; however, the products are drastically different. The carbon is converted 
into methane gas instead of CO2; sulfur is converted into hydrogen sulfide gas. Some of the sulfide 
may be precipitated as iron sulfide. Under anaerobic conditions, the iron phosphate precipitated in 
the sediments may be released from the sediments making the phosphate bioavailable. This is a key 204 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCcomponent of the growth-and-decay cycle. The water body may gradually fill with decaying and 
partially decomposed plant materials to make a swamp, which is the natural aging process. The 
problem is that this process can be significantly accelerated by human activities.
Phosphates were once commonly used in laundry detergents, which contributed to excessive con -
centrations in rivers, lakes, and streams. Most detergents no longer contain phosphorous. Currently, 
the predominant outside sources of phosphorus are agricultural and lawn fertilizers and improperly 
disposed animal wastes.
ALGAE AND THE NITROGEN CYCLE
The growth of all organisms depends on the availability of mineral nutrients, and none is more 
important than nitrogen, which is required in large amounts as an essential component of peptides, 
proteins, enzymes, chlorophylls, energy-transfer molecules (ATP, ADP), genetic materials (RNA, 
DNA), and other cellular constituents.
Nitrogen is present in all the four different spheres of the earth: the lithosphere contains about 
98% of the global N (1.7  ×  1017 tons), distributed among its different compartments (soils and sedi -
ments of the crust, mantle, and core). The core and the mantle have been estimated to contain 
a total of over 1.6  ×  1017 tons of N. However, this N is not readily available to be cycled in the 
near-surface earth environment. Some periodically enters the atmosphere and hydrosphere through 
volcanic eruptions, primarily as ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen (N2) gas. Most of the remainder (~2%, 
4  ×  1015 tons) is found in the atmosphere, where nitrogen gas (N2) comprises more than 78% of the 
volume. The hydrosphere and the biosphere together contain relatively little N compared with the 
other spheres (~0.015%, 3  ×  1012 tons).
Nitrogen has many chemical forms, both organic and inorganic, in the atmosphere, biosphere, 
hydrosphere, and lithosphere. It occurs in the gas, liquid (dissolved in water), and solid phases. N 
can be associated with carbon (organic species) and with elements other than carbon (inorganic spe -
cies). Important inorganic species include nitrate ( NO3−), nitrite ( NO2−), nitric acid (HNO3), ammonium 
(NH4+), ammonia (NH3), the gas N2, nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2). Most organic N species in the four spheres are biomolecules, such as proteins, peptides, 
enzymes, and genetic material. The presence of these many chemical forms make the N cycle more 
complex with respect to the cycle of other nutrients. The key processes linking the major pathways 
of the nitrogen cycle are the following:
• N-fixation, that is, reduction of atmospheric N2 into ammonia NH3
• Assimilation, that is, conversion of NO3− and NH4+ to organic nitrogen
• Mineralization, or ammonification, that is, conversion of organic nitrogen to NH4+
• Nitrification, that is, conversion of NH4+ to NO2− and successively NO3−
• Denitrification, that is, conversion of NO3− to gaseous forms of nitrogen (NO, N2O, N2)
Though complex microbial relationships regulate these processes, we can assume that fixation, 
mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification are carried out almost exclusively by bacteria, whereas 
algae play a main active role only in nitrogen fixation and assimilation. Greatly simplifying the overall 
nitrogen cycle, and from an algal point of view, atmospheric molecular nitrogen is converted by pro -
karyotic algae (cyanobacteria) to compounds such as ammonia (fixation), which are in part directly 
converted into amino acids, proteins, and other nitrogen-containing cell constituents of the fixators, 
and in part excreted into the open environment. Eukaryotic algae, unable to perform fixation, incor -
porate fixed nitrogen, either ammonium or nitrate, into organic N compounds by assimilation. When 
organic matter is degraded, organic compounds are broken down into inorganic compounds such as 
NH3 or NH4+ and CO2 through the mineralization process. The resultant ammonium can be nitrified 
by aerobic chemoautotrophic bacteria that use it as electron donor in the respiration process. The cycle 
is completed by denitrification carried out by usually facultative anaerobic bacteria that reduce nitrate 205 Biogeochemical Role of Algae

the N cycle would have an almost infinite number of intermediary steps along the circumference of a 
circle, connected by a spiderweb of internal, crisscrossing complex connections.
It is one of nature’s great ironies that though all life forms require nitrogen compounds, the most 
abundant portion of it (98%) is buried in the rocks, and therefore deep and unavailable, and the rest 
of nitrogen, the N2 gas (2%), can be utilized only by very few organisms. This gas cannot be used by 
most organisms because the triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms makes the molecule almost 
inert. In order for N2 to be used for growth, this gas must be “fixed” in the forms directly accessible 
to most organisms, that is, ammonia and nitrate ions.
A relatively small amount of fixed nitrogen is produced by atmospheric fixation (5–8%) by 
means of the high temperature and the pressure associated with lightning. The enormous energy 
of this phenomenon breaks nitrogen molecules and enables their atoms to combine with oxygen 
in the air forming nitrogen oxides. These molecules dissolve in rain, forming nitrates that are 
carried to the earth. Another relatively small amount of fixed nitrogen is produced industrially 
(industrial fixation) by the Haber-Bosch process, in which atmospheric nitrogen and hydrogen 
(usually derived from natural gas or petroleum) can be combined to form ammonia (NH3) using 
an iron-based catalyst, at very high pressures and a temperature of about 600°C. Ammonia can be 
used directly as a fertilizer, but most of it is further processed to urea (NH2)2CO and ammonium 
nitrate (NH4NO3).
The major conversion of N2 into ammonium, and then into proteins, is a biotic process achieved 
by microorganisms, which represents one of the most metabolically expensive processes in biology. 
Biological nitrogen fixation can be represented by the following equation, in which 2 mol of ammo -
nia (but in solution, ammonia exists only as an ammonium ion, that is, NH HO NH OH32+↔ ++−
4 ) 
are produced from 1 mol of nitrogen gas, at the expense of 16 mol of ATP and a supply of electrons 
and protons (hydrogen ions):
 NH eA TP NH H ADP Pi 23 2 88 16 21 61 6 ++ +→ ++ ++− (5.2)
All known nitrogen-fixing organisms (diazotrophs) are prokaryotes, and the ability to fix nitro -
gen is widely, though paraphyletically, distributed across both the bacterial and archaeal domains. 
In cyanobacteria, nitrogen fixation is an inducible process, triggered by low environmental levels 
of fixed nitrogen.
The capacity of nitrogen fixation in diazotrophs relies solely upon an ATP-hydrolyzing, redox-
active enzyme complex termed nitrogenase. In many of these organisms, nitrogenase comprises 
about 10% of total cellular proteins and consists of two highly conserved components, an iron pro -
tein (Fe-protein), and a molybdenum-iron protein (MoFe-protein). The Fe-protein is a γ2 homodimer 
composed of a single Fe4S4 cluster bound between identical 32–40 kDa subunits. The Fe4S4 cluster 
is redox-active and is similar to those found in small molecular weight electron carrier proteins 
such as ferredoxins. It is the only known active agent capable of obtaining more than two oxidative 
states and transferring electrons to the MoFe-protein. The MoFe-protein is a α2β2 heterotetramer; 
the ensemble is approximately 250 kDa. The α subunit contains the active site for dinitrogen reduc -
tion, typically a MoFe7S9 metal cluster (termed FeMo cofactor), although some organisms contain 
nitrogenases, wherein Mo is replaced by either Fe or V. These so-called alternative nitrogenases are 
found only in a limited subset of diazotrophs and, in all cases studied so far, are present secondarily 
to the MoFe-nitrogenase. The MoFe-nitrogenase has been found to be more specific for and more 
efficient in binding N2 and reducing it to ammonia than either of the alternative nitrogenases. The 
catalytic efficiency of these alternative nitrogenases is lower than that of the MoFe-nitrogenase. In 
addition to variations in metal cofactors, the nitrogenase complex is nonspecific and reduces triple 
and double bond molecules other than N2. These include hydrogen azide, nitrous oxide, acetylene, 
and hydrogen cyanide. The nonspecificity of this enzyme and the alternative nitrogenases contain -
ing other metal cofactors implicate the role of varying environmental pressures on the evolutionary 206 Algae

The nitrogenase enzyme system is extremely O2-sensitive, since oxygen not only affects the protein 
structure, but also inhibits the synthesis of nitrogenase in many diazothrops. The repression is both 
transient (lasting only a few hours) and permanent. The reactions occur while N2 is bound to the 
nitrogenase enzyme complex. The Fe-protein is first reduced by electrons donated by ferredoxin. 
Then the reduced Fe-protein binds ATP and reduces the MoFe-protein, which donates electrons to 
N2, producing diimide (HN ∙NH). In two further cycles of this process (each requiring electrons 
donated by ferredoxin), HN ∙NH is reduced to imide (H2N–NH2), which in turn is reduced to 
2NH3. Depending on the type of microorganism, the reduced ferredoxin which supplies electrons 
for this process is generated by fermentation or photosynthesis and respiration.
As already stated, nitrogenase is highly sensitive to molecular oxygen ( in vitro  it is irreversibly 
inhibited by exposure to O2). Therefore, during the course of planetary evolution, cyanobacteria 
have co-evolved with the changing oxidation state of the ocean and atmosphere to accommodate 
the machinery of oxygenic photosynthesis and oxygen-sensitive N2 fixation within the same cell 
and/or colony of cells. Since nitrogen fixation occurs in a varied metabolic context in both anaero -
bic and aerobic environments, strategies have followed a very complex pattern of biochemical and 
physiological mechanisms for segregation that can be simplified in some spatial and/or temporal 
separation of the two pathways.
Nitrogenase is an ancient enzyme that almost certainly arose in the Archean ocean before the 
oxidation of the atmosphere by oxygenic photoautotrophs. An attractive hypothesis of the develop -
ment of biological nitrogen fixation is that it arouse in response to changes in atmospheric com -
position that resulted in the reduction of the production of abiotically fixed nitrogen. On the early 
earth, concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were high, because of oxidation of CO produced by 
impacts of extraterrestrial bodies and only slow removal of CO2 by weathering (the continents were 
smaller at this time, meaning that a smaller area of minerals was exposed for weathering). With 
these CO2 conditions, the initial production rate of NO was estimated to be about 3 × 1011 g year−1. 
Atmospheric CO2 levels declined with time; however, the impact rate dropped and the continents 
grew. A rise in atmospheric CH4 produced by methanogenic, methane-generating, bacteria may 
have warmed the Archaean earth and speeded the removal of CO2 by silicate weathering. As this 
happened, the production rate of NO by lightning dropped to below 3 × 109 g year−1 because of 
the reduced availability of oxygen atoms from the splitting of CO2 and H2O. The resulting crisis 
in the availability of fixed nitrogen for organisms triggered the evolution of biological nitrogen 
fixation about 2.2 billion years ago. Under the prevailing anaerobic conditions of that period in 
earth’s history, anaerobic heterotrophs, such as Clostridium , developed. With the evolution of cya -
nobacteria and the subsequent generation of molecular oxygen, oxygen-protective mechanisms 
would be essential. A semitemporal separation of nitrogen fixation and oxygenic photosynthe -
sis combined with spatial heterogeneity was the first oxygen-protective mechanism developed by 
marine cyanobacteria such as Trichodesmium  sp. and Katagnymene  sp. A full temporal separation, 
in which nitrogen is only fixed at night, then developed in unicellular diazotrophs and in some 
nonheterocystous filamentous diazotrophs (e.g., Oscillatoria limosa  and Plectonema boryanum ). 
Finally, in yet other filamentous organisms, complete segregation of N2 fixation and photosynthesis 
was achieved with the cellular differentiation and evolution of heterocystous cyanobacteria (e.g., 
Nostoc  and Anabaena ).
The nonheterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria Trichodesmium  sp. and Katagnymene  sp., 
unlike all other nonheterocystous species, fix nitrogen only during the day. Nitrogenase is compart -
mentalized in 15–20% of the cells in Trichodesmium  sp., and 7% of the cells in Katagnymene  sp. 
often arranged consecutively along the trichome, but active photosynthetic components (PSI, PSII, 
RuBisCo, and carboxysomes) are found in all cells, even those harboring nitrogenase. A combined 
spatial and temporal segregation of nitrogen fixation from photosynthesis and a sequential progres -
sion of photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen fixation over a diel cycle are the strategies used by 
these cyanobacteria. These pathways are entrained in a circadian pattern that is ultimately controlled 207 Biogeochemical Role of Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCby the requirement for an anaerobic environment around nitrogenase. Light initiates photosynthesis, 
providing energy and reductants for carbohydrate synthesis and storage, stimulating electron cycling 
through PSI, and poising the plastoquinone (PQ) pool at reduced levels. High respiration rates early 
in the photoperiod supply carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis (the primary sink for fixed nitro -
gen) but simultaneously reduce the PQ pool further. Linear electron flow to PSI is never abolished. 
The reduced PQ pool leads to a down-regulation of PSII, which opens a window of opportunity for 
N2 fixation during the photoperiod, when oxygen consumption exceeds oxygen production. As the 
carbohydrate pool is consumed, respiratory electron flow through the PQ pool diminishes, intracel -
lular oxygen concentrations rises, the PQ pool becomes increasingly oxidized, and net oxygenic 
production exceeds consumption. Nitrogenase activity is lost until the following day.
A full temporal separation between oxygenic photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation occurs in 
P. boryanum  and O. limosa . Transcription of nitrogenase and photosynthetic genes are tempo -
rally separated within the photoperiod, that is, nitrogenase is expressed primarily during the night. 
Nitrogenase is contained in all cells in equal amounts. The onset of nitrogen fixation is preceded 
by a depression in photosynthesis that establishes a sufficiently low level of dissolved oxygen in the 
environment. Plectonema  sp. has a versatile physiology that allows it to reversibly modulate uncou -
pling of the activity of the two photosystems in response to intracellular nitrogen status. Oscillatoria  
sp. initiate nitrogen fixation in the dark and perform it primarily in the absence of light.
In nonheterocystous cyanobacteria such as the filamentous Symploca  sp. and Lyngbya maius -
cola, and the unicellular Gloeothece  sp. and Cyanothece  sp., the temporal separation does not need 
for a microaerobic environment. Phormidium  sp. and Pseudoanabaena  sp. are other examples of 
cyanobacteria fixing only under microanaerobic conditions. Under contemporary oxygen levels, all 
of these organisms are relegated to narrow environmental niches.
In heterocystous cyanobacteria, such as Anabaena  sp. and Nostoc  sp., a highly refined special -
ization spatially separates oxygenic photosynthesis from N2 fixation. Here, nitrogenase is confined 
to a micro-anaerobic cell, the heterocyst, characterized by a thick membrane that slows the diffu -
sion of O2, high PSI activity, loss of division capacity, absence of PSII (that splits the water forming 
O2), and variation of phycobiliproteins content. This cell differentiates completely and irreversibly 
12–20 h after combined nitrogen sources are removed from the medium. The development of these 
cells, formed at intervals between vegetative cells, is a primitive form of cell differentiation. In this 
process, all PSII activity is gradually lost, and the proteins involved in oxygenic photosynthesis are 
degraded, while PSI activity is maintained. Simultaneously, the production of active nitrogenase 
is triggered. Nitrogen fixation is localized specifically in heterocysts, and light is used for cyclic 
electron flow around PSI to maintain a supply of ATP for the process. The primary organic nitrogen 
product (glutamate) is exported to adjacent vegetative and photo-oxygenic cells, while carbon skel -
etons, formed by the respiratory and photosynthetic processes in the latter cells, are translocated to 
the heterocysts. In some heterocystous cyanobacteria such as Anabaena variabilis , under anaerobic 
conditions, a different Mo-dependent nitrogenase can be synthesized inside vegetative cells. This 
nitrogenase is expressed shortly after nitrogen depletion, but prior to heterocyst formation, and can 
support the fixed N needs of the filaments independent of the nitrogenase in the heterocysts. Figure 
5.1 shows the position of a heterocyst (H), and the akinetes (A) formed adjacent to it in a filament 
of Anabaena  sp. The absorption spectra measured by microspectrophotometry on these cells and a 
vegetative cell (V) are shown on the right side of the figure. The absorption spectrum of the hetero -
cyst indicates that phycobiliproteins are lacking at this stage of development.
The biotic nitrogen fixation is estimated to produce about 1.7 × 108 tons per year of ammonia, 
while atmospheric and industrial nitrogen fixation produce about 1.7 × 107 tons per year of ammonia.
For all eukaryotic algae, the only forms of inorganic nitrogen that are directly assimilable are 
nitrate ( NO3−), nitrite ( NO2−), and ammonium ( NH4+). The more highly oxidized form, nitrate, is the 
most thermodynamically stable form in oxidized aquatic environments and hence is the predomi -
nant form of fixed nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems, though not necessarily the most readily available 
form. Following translocation across the plasmalemma (which is an energy-dependent process), the 208 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCassimilation of NO3− requires chemical reduction to NH4+. This process is mediated by two enzymes, 
namely nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase. Nitrate reductase is located in the cytosol and uses 
NADPH to catalyze the two-electron transfer:
 NO eH NO HO32 2 22−− +−++ →+  (5.3)
In cyanobacteria, nitrate reductase is coupled to the oxidation of ferredoxin rather than a pyri -
dine nucleotide as in eukaryotic algae. The nitrite formed by nitrate reductase is reduced in a six-
electron transfer reaction:
 NO eH NH HO24 2 68 2−− ++++ →+  (5.4)
Nitrite reductase utilizes ferredoxin in both cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae; in the latter, the 
enzyme is localized in the chloroplasts. In both cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae, photosynthetic 
electron flow is an important source of reduced ferredoxin for nitrite reduction. The overall stoichi -
ometry for the reduction of nitrate to ammonium can be written as
 NO eH NH HO34 2 81 03−− ++++ →+  (5.5)
The incorporation of ammonium into amino acids is primarily brought about by the sequen -
tial action of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamine 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT).

ever, glutamate must be exported from the chloroplast to the cytosol where transamination reaction 
(the reversible transfer of an amino group of a specific amino acid to a specific keto acid, forming a 
new keto acid and a new amino acid) can proceed, thereby facilitating the syntheses of other amino 
acids.
ALGAE AND THE SILICON CYCLE
The biogeochemical cycle of silicon (Si) might be interpreted as those processes that link sources 
and sinks of silicic acid [Si(OH)4]. Silicic acid is the only precursor in the processing and deposition 
of silicon in biota. The biogeochemical cycle of silicon does not facilitate a high biospheric abun -
dance of the element; in fact, silicon cycle differs from the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur 
and it is similar to phosphorus in that there is no atmospheric reservoir. The silicon cycle, like those 
for phosphorus and the divalent metals calcium and magnesium, has a significant abiotic drain. The 
cycle actually consists of two parts: the terrestrial or freshwater cycle and the marine cycle, the for -
mer feeding the latter. However, its replenishment can occur only via the marine sedimentary cycle. 
This is dependent upon geotectonic processes, such as mountain building and subduction, and, as 
such, will incur delays of tens to hundreds of millions years before marine silicon is returned to the 
terrestrial environment.
The substantial losses of biospheric silicic acid to abiotic sinks may be compensated for in nature 
by its overall abundance in the earth’s crust. It is the second most abundant element in the litho -
sphere (28%), iron being the first one (35%). It is found in the earth’s crust in silicate minerals, the 
most prevalent of which are quartz, the alkali feldspars, and plagioclase. The latter two minerals are 
aluminosilicates and contribute significantly to the aluminum content of the crust. All of these min -
erals are broken down by the process of weathering. Important feedback exists between autotrophs 
(algae and plants), weathering, and CO2.
The dominant form of weathering is the carbonation reaction involving carbonic acid (H2CO3), 
which results in enhanced removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, because the net effect of silicate 
mineral weathering is to convert soil carbon, derived ultimately from photosynthesis, into dissolved 
HCO3−. On a geological timescale, this transfer has an important control on the CO2 content of 
the atmosphere and hence global climate. Weathering is a complex function of rainfall, runoff, 
lithology, temperature, topography, vegetation, and magnitudes. Algae, plants, and their associate 
microbiota directly affect silicate mineral weathering in several ways: by generation of organic sub -
stances, known as chelates , that have the ability to decompose minerals and rocks by the removal of 
metallic cations ; by modifying pH through production of CO2 or organic acids such as acetic, citric, 
phenolic, etc., and by altering the physical properties of a soil, particularly the exposed surface areas 
of minerals, and the residence time of water. The significance of this natural process for biota can 
be found in the detailed geochemistry of the weathering reactions and, in particular, in the rates at 210 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCwhich these reactions occur. The rate of mineral weathering is dependent upon a number of factors 
including the temperature, pH, and ionic composition of the solvent (or leachate) and hydrogeologi -
cal parameters such as water flow.
Silicification occurs in three clades of photosynthetic heterokonts: Chrysophyceae (Parmales), 
Bacillariophyceae, and Dictyochophyceae, with diatoms being the world’s largest contributors to 
biosilicification. Since amorphous silica (SiO2) is an essential component of the diatom cell wall, 
silicon availability is a key factor in the regulation of diatom growth in nature; in turn, the use of sili -
con by diatoms dominates the biogeochemical cycling of silicon in the sea, with each atom of silicon 
weathered from land passing through a diatom an average of 39 times before burial in the seabed.
Several thousand million years ago, little if any of the life on earth was involved in the process -
ing of silicic acid to amorphous silica (SiO2 ⋅ nH2O). The concentration of silicic acid in the aque -
ous environment was high, in the order of millimolar, and reflected equilibration according to the 
dominant mineral weathering reactions at that time. The prevalence of these environments rich in 
silicic acid is indicated in the fossil record by evidence of blue-green algae found encased in silica 
cherts. It is important to recognize that implicit in this observation is the acceptance that early bio -
chemical evolution proceeded within environments which, relative to the conditions which prevail 
today, were extremely rich in silicic acid. Concomitant with the advent of dioxygen, and its subse -
quent gradual increase in atmospheric concentration from approximately 1% toward the today level 
of 21%, there occurred an increasing number of organisms within which silicic acid was processed 
to silica. The most important of these, in terms of their diversity, ubiquity (both freshwater and 
marine species), and biomass, were the diatoms. The diatoms are characterized by a silica frustule 
which surrounds their cell wall. Silicic acid is freely diffusible across the cell walls and membranes 
and, in most cell types of most organisms, the intracellular concentration of silicic acid equilibrates 
with the extracellular environment according to a “Donnan equilibrium” (the equilibrium char -
acterized by an unequal distribution of diffusible ions between two ionic solutions separated by a 
membrane which is impermeable to at least one of the ionic species present). However, while the 
intracellular concentration of the silicic acid in the diatom has not been measured, it is likely that 
it is under kinetic as opposed to thermodynamic control and that it is maintained at an extremely 
low level, probably <1 μmol. This kinetic control of the intracellular silicic acid concentration may 
be achieved through the condensation and polymerization of silicic acid in a number of chemical 
(e.g., pH-controlled) and physical (e.g., membrane-bound) compartments eventually resulting in 
amorphous silica. This biogenic silica is then deposited in a controlled manner to form the intricate 
and elaborate silica frustules. How all of these remarkable feats of chemistry are achieved within 
the diatom remains largely unknown. However, what is known, and is becoming more apparent, is 
the formative role played by diatoms and other silica-forming organisms, such as silicoflagellates, 
radiolarian, and sponges, in the biogeochemical cycle of silicon.
The reactions of condensation of silicic acid and subsequent polymerization to form biogenic 
silica eventually (i.e., upon the death of the organism) result in a net loss of silicic acid to the bio -
sphere. The rate of the forward reaction (condensation and polymerization) is orders of magnitude 
higher than that of the reverse (regeneration of silicic acid pool) with the result that concomitant 
with the rise of the diatoms and other silica-forming organisms there was a significant reduction 
in the environmental silicic acid concentration. Silica frustules are formed in a matter of hours to 
days, whereas the rate at which silicic acid is returned to the biosphere through the dissolution of 
the frustules of dead diatoms as they sink in the water column is in the order of 10−9 μmol m−2 s−1. 
In addition, the dissolution of these sinking frustules can be greatly influenced by the chemistry of 
the water column. For example, the frustule is a highly adsorptive surface and is implicated in the 
removal of metal ions, for example, aluminum, from the water column. These adsorptive processes 
tend to stabilize the frustule surface toward dissolution, thereby reducing the amount of silicic acid 
returned to the biosphere during sedimentation. Once the silica frustules have settled to the bottom, 
their silica enters the sedimentary cycle whereupon it is unlikely to reappear in the biosphere for 
tens of millions of years.211 Biogeochemical Role of Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThe biologically induced dramatic decline in the environmental silicic acid concentration had 
the effect of accelerating the rate of mineral weathering. This, in turn, consumed more carbon diox -
ide and precipitated a gradual reduction in the atmospheric concentration of this “greenhouse” gas. 
The impact of the emergence of diatoms and other silica-forming organisms, and then the spread 
of rooted vascular plants, on the biogeochemical cycle of silicon contributed significantly to the 
global cooling which has resulted in the climate of today. The diatoms, in particular, are extremely 
successful organisms and will continue to deposit silica frustules of varying silica content at micro -
molar concentrations of environmental silicic acid. In this way, they are a continuous accelerant 
of mineral weathering almost regardless of how low the environmental silicic acid concentration 
may fall. From the advent of the silica-forming organisms, the process of biochemical evolution has 
continued in silicon-replete, though no longer of millimolar concentration, environments. Diatoms 
in sedimentary deposits of marine and continental, especially lacustrine, origin belong to differ -
ent geologic ranges and physiographic environments. Marine diatoms range in age from Early 
Cretaceous to Holocene, and continental diatoms range in age from Eocene to Holocene; how -
ever, most commercial diatomites, both marine and lacustrine, were deposited during the Miocene. 
Marine deposits of commercial value generally accumulated along continental margins with sub -
merged coastal basins and shelves where wind-driven boundary currents provided the nutrient-rich 
upwelling conditions capable of supporting a productive diatom habitat. Commercial freshwater 
diatomite deposits occur in volcanic terrains associated with events that formed sediment-starved 
drainage basins. Generally, marine habitats are characterized by stable conditions of temperature, 
salinity, pH, nutrients, and water currents, in contrast to lacustrine habitats, which are characterized 
by wide variations in these conditions. Marine deposits generally are of higher quality and contain 
larger resources, owing to their greater areal extent and thickness, whereas most of the world’s 
known diatomites are of lacustrine origin.
Unlike many other algae, the division cycles of which are strongly coupled to the diel light cycle, 
diatoms are capable of dividing at any point of the diel cycle. This light independence extends to 
their nutrient requirements, with nitrate and silicic acid uptake and storage continuing during the 
night through the use of excess organic carbon synthesized during the day. Moreover, the silica frus -
tule has recently been shown to play a role in CO2 acquisition, which indicates that Si limitation can 
induce CO2 limitation in diatoms. Specifically, the silica frustule facilitates the enzymatic conver -
sion of bicarbonate to CO2 at the cell surface by serving as a pH buffer, thus enabling more efficient 
photosynthesis. This control by diatoms and the reduction in silicate input from rivers due to cool -
ing and drying of the climate offers a feedback mechanism between climate variability, diatom pro -
ductivity, and CO2 exchange. These features of diatom physiology almost certainly contribute to the 
in situ  observation that diatoms have greater maximum growth rates relative to comparable algae. 
Further, so long as silicic acid is abundant (and other nutrients nonlimiting), diatoms are found to 
dominate algal communities. Diatoms are estimated to contribute up to 45% of total oceanic pri -
mary production, making them major players in the cycling of all biological elements. They glob -
ally uptake and process 240 Tmol Si year −1. Nowadays, risk to diatoms comes from both climate 
forced impacts and anthropogenic sources. Reduced input of silicate due to damming of rivers and 
changes in water-use patterns, and increased input of inhibitory levels of ammonium to estuaries 
and adjacent coastal waters affect diatom success. The high ammonium concentrations prevalent in 
some estuaries, a result of anthropogenic inputs from sewage-treatment plants and agricultural run -
off inhibit the uptake of nitrate by diatoms which draw primarily on nitrate for high growth rates.
Aside from their role in the silicon cycle, the diatoms have also attracted attention because of 
their importance to the export of primary production to the ocean’s interior. Aggregation and sink -
ing is an important aspect in the life history of many diatom species, and high sinking velocities, 
whether as individuals, aggregates, or mats, allow diatoms to rapidly transport material out of the 
surface mixed layer. Additionally, mesozooplankton grazers that consume diatoms produce large, 
fast- sinking fecal pellets. These processes remove nutrients and carbon from the productive sur -
face waters before they can be remineralized, making the diatoms crucial to “new” (or export) 212 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCproduction. So long as silicic acid is available, diatoms act as a conduit for nutrients and carbon to 
deep waters, contrasting with the production of other algae which “traps” nutrients in a regeneration 
loop at the surface.
Though diatoms are by far the most important organisms that take up silicic acid to form their 
encasing structures, silicoflagellates also deserve mentioning. These unicellular heterokont algae 
belong to a small group of siliceous marine phytoplankton. Silicoflagellates live in the upper part of 
the water column and are adapted for life in tropical, temperate, and frigid waters. Silicoflagellates 
have a multistage life-cycle, not all stages of which are known. The best-known stage consists of a 
naked cell body with a single anterior flagellum and numerous plastids contained within an external 
lateral skeleton. This skeleton is composed of hollow beams of amorphous silica, forming a network 
of bars and spikes arranged to form an internal basket. The siliceous skeleton of silicoflagellates is 
very susceptible to dissolution and therefore their preservation is often hindered by diagenetic pro -
cesses; moreover, their abundance is relatively low compared to that of other siliceous microfossils, 
since they form a small component of marine sediments; both these reasons make their presence 
rare in the sedimentary record.
ALGAE AND THE SULFUR CYCLE
Sulfur is an essential element for autotrophs and heterotrophs. In its reduced oxidation state, the 
nutrient sulfur plays an important part in the structure and function of proteins. Three amino acids 
found in almost all proteins (cysteine, cystine, and methionine) contain carbon-bounded sulfur. 
Sulfur is also found in sulfolipids, some vitamins, sulfate esters, and a variety of other compounds.
In its fully oxidized state, sulfur exists as sulfate and is the major cause of acidity in both natural 
and polluted rainwater. This link to acidity makes sulfur important to geochemical, atmospheric, 
and biological processes such as the natural weathering of rocks, acid precipitation, and rates of 
denitrification. Sulfur cycle is also one of the main elemental cycles most heavily perturbed by 
human activity. Estimates suggest that emissions of sulfur to the atmosphere from human activity 
are at least equal or probably larger in magnitude than those from natural processes. Like nitrogen, 
sulfur can exist in many forms: as gases or sulfuric acid particles. The lifetime of most sulfur com -
pounds in the air is relatively short (e.g., days). Superimposed on these fast cycles of sulfur are the 
extremely slow sedimentary-cycle processes or erosion, sedimentation, and uplift of rocks contain -
ing sulfur. Sulfur compounds from volcanoes are intermittently injected into the atmosphere, and a 
continual stream of these compounds is produced from industrial activities. These compounds mix 
with water vapor and form sulfuric acid smog. In addition to contributing to acid rain, the sulfuric 
acid droplets of smog form a haze layer that reflects solar radiation and can cause a cooling of the 
earth’s surface. While many questions remain concerning specifics, the sulfur cycle, in general, 
and acid rain and smog issues, in particular, are becoming major physical, biological, and social 
problems.
The sulfur cycle can be thought of as beginning with the gas sulfur dioxide (SO2) or the particles 
of sulfate ( SO42−) compounds in the air. These compounds either fall out or are rained out of the 
atmosphere. Algae and plants take up some forms of these compounds and incorporate them into 
their tissues. Then, as with nitrogen, these organic sulfur compounds are returned to the land or 
water after the algae and plants die or are consumed by heterotrophs. Bacteria are important here 
as well since they can transform the organic sulfur to hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). In the oceans, 
certain phytoplankton can produce a chemical that transforms organic sulfur to SO2 that resides in 
the atmosphere. These gases can re-enter the atmosphere, water, and soil, and continue the cycle.
All living organisms require S as a minor nutrient, in roughly the same atom proportion as 
phosphorus. Sulfur is present in freshwater algae at a ratio of about 1 S atom to 100 C atoms (0.15–
1.96% by dry weight), and the S content varies with species, environmental conditions, and season. 
Vascular plants, algae, and bacteria (except some anaerobes that require S2−) have the ability to take 
up, reduce, and assimilate SO42− into amino acids and convert SO42− into ester sulfate compounds.213 Biogeochemical Role of Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCReduced volatile sulfur compounds, which are released to the oxygen-rich atmosphere, are 
chemically oxidized during their atmospheric lifetime and end up finally as SO2 (oxidation state +4) 
and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and particulate SO42− (oxidation state +6) and methane sulfonate (oxida -
tion state +6). It is mainly these compounds that are removed from the atmosphere and brought back 
to the earth by dry and wet depositions.
Since the oxidation state of sulfur in H2SO4 (+6) is the most stable under oxic conditions, sulfate 
is the predominant form of sulfur in oxic waters and soils. Thus, the reduction of sulfate to a more 
reduced sulfur species is a necessary prerequisite for the formation of volatile sulfur compounds 
and their emission to the atmosphere. Biochemical processes which lead to this reduction can be 
considered as the driving force of the atmospheric sulfur cycle.
Two types of biochemical pathways of sulfate reduction are important in the global cycles: dis -
similatory and assimilatory sulfate reduction. Dissimilatory reduction of sulfate is a strictly anaero -
bic process that takes place only in anoxic environments. Sulfate-reducing bacteria reduce sulfate 
and other sulfur oxides to support respiratory metabolism, using sulfate as a terminal electron 
acceptor instead of molecular oxygen. Since the process is strictly anaerobic, dissimilatory sulfate 
reduction occurs largely in stratified, anoxic water basins and in sediments of wetlands, lakes, and 
coastal marine ecosystems. The process is particularly important in marine ecosystems, including 
salt marshes, because sulfate is easily available due to its high concentration in seawater (28 mM; 
900 mg L−1).
In contrast to animals, which are dependent on organo-sulfur compounds in their food to supply 
their sulfur requirement, other biota (bacteria, cyanobacteria, fungi, eukaryotic algae, and vas -
cular plants) can obtain sulfur from assimilatory sulfate reduction for synthesis of organo-sulfur 
compounds. Sulfate is assimilated from the environment, reduced inside the cell, and fixed into 
sulfur-containing amino acids and other organic compounds. The process is ubiquitous in both 
oxic and anoxic environments. Most of the reduced sulfur is fixed by the intracellular assimilation 
process and only a minor fraction of the reduced sulfur is released as volatile gaseous compounds, 
as long as the organisms are alive. However, after death of the organisms, microbial degradation 
liberates reduced sulfur compounds (mainly in the form of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and dimethyl 
sulfide (DMS), but also as organic sulfides) to the environment. During this stage, volatile sulfur 
compounds may escape to the atmosphere. However, as with sulfides formed from dissimilatory 
sulfate reduction, the sulfides released during decomposition are chemically unstable in an oxic 
environment and are re-oxidized to sulfate by a variety of microorganisms.
Sulfate is taken up into the cell by an active transport mechanism and inserted into an energeti -
cally activated molecule, APS (adenosine-5 ′-phosphosulfate), which can be further activated at the 
expense of one more ATP molecule to PAPS (3 ′-phosphoadenosine-5 ′-phosphosulfate). It is then 
transferred to a thiol carrier (a molecule with a –SH group) and reduced to the −2 oxidation state. In 
contrast to nitrate assimilation, where the various intermediates are present free in the cytoplasm, 
sulfur remains attached to a carrier during the reduction sequence. In a final step, the carrier-bound 
sulfide reacts with O-acetyl-serine to form cysteine. Cysteine serves as the starting compound for 
the biosynthesis of all other sulfur metabolites, especially the other sulfur-containing amino acids 
homocysteine and methionine. Cysteine and methionine are the major sulfur amino acids and rep -
resent a very large fraction of the sulfur content of biological materials.
One aspect of the sulfur metabolism of algae deserves special mention because of its atmospheric 
consequences: many types of marine algae including planktonic algae, such as prymnesiophytes, 
dinoflagellates, diatoms, chrysophytes, and prasinophytes, and macroalgae, such as chlorophytes 
and rhodophytes, produce large amount of dimethylsulfonium propionate (DMSP) from sulfur- 
containing amino acids (methionine). DMSP is the precursor of DMS, its enzymatic cleavage prod -
uct, which is a gas with a strong smell, and in turn is a major source of atmospheric sulfur. Marine 
organisms generate about half the biogenic sulfur emitted to the atmosphere annually, and the 
majority of this sulfur is produced as DMS. Because reduced sulfur compounds such as DMS are 
rapidly oxidized to sulfur dioxides that function as cloud condensation nuclei, the production of 214 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCDMS can potentially affect climate on a global scale. DMS has also a peculiar role: birds use DMS 
as a foraging cue, as algae being consumed by fish release DMS, as consequence bringing the pres -
ence of the fish to the attention of the birds.
DMSP can function as osmoregulator, buoyancy controller, cryoprotectant, and antioxidant. 
Freshwater algae do not produce DMSP, since, being an osmolyte, it has no significance in fresh -
water systems. It has also been postulated that DMSP production is indirectly related to the nitro -
gen nutrition of algae, with DMSP being a store for excess sulfate taken up while assimilating the 
molybdenum necessary to synthesize nitrate reductase or nitrogenase (this could also be true for 
vascular plants with high nitrate-reductase activities or with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria). 
The cleavage of DMSP by means of the enzyme DMSP lyase produces gaseous DMS and acrylic 
acid. DMSP can also be released from phytoplankton cells during senescence, whereas zooplankton 
grazing on healthy cells is thought to facilitate the release of DMSP from ruptured algal cells during 
sloppy feeding. Once released from algal cells, DMSP undergoes microbially mediated conversion 
by cleavage into gaseous DMS and acrylate.
It had been known for many years that the global budget of sulfur could not be balanced without 
a substantial flux of this element from the oceans to the atmosphere and then to land. Once emit -
ted from the sea, DMS is transformed in the atmosphere by free radicals (particularly hydroxyl 
and nitrate) to form a variety of products, most importantly sulfur dioxide and sulfate in the form 
of small particles. As already stated, these products are acidic and are responsible for the natural 
acidity of atmospheric particles; activities of human in burning fossil fuels add further sulfur acid -
ity to this natural process. In addition, the sulfate particles (both natural and manmade) can alter 
the amount of radiation reaching earth’s surface both directly by scattering of solar energy and 
indirectly by acting as the nuclei on which cloud droplets form (cloud condensation nuclei, CCN), 
thereby affecting the energy reflected back to space by clouds (denser cloud albedo). The reduction 
in the amount of sunlight that reaches the earth surface leads to the consequent reduction of global 
temperature. This drop in temperature is suggested to cause a decrease in the primary production 
of DMSP (in other words, DMS). Thus, DMS is considered to be counteractive to the behavior of 
green house gases such as CO2 and CH4. Removal of the algae-DMS-derived sulfur from the air 
by rain and deposition of particles is a significant source of this biologically important element for 
some terrestrial ecosystems.
ALGAE AND THE OXYGEN–CARBON CYCLES
The oxygen and carbon cycles are closely related, because they are directly associated with photo -
synthesis and respiration processes.
The natural oxygen cycle is determined by the aerobic respiration of glucose (taking place in 
all living organisms), which consumes oxygen in free form (O2) using it as an electron sink and 
produces carbon dioxide and water, and by the photosynthesis, which consumes carbon dioxide and 
water to produce carbohydrates and molecular oxygen as a by-product, as we have seen in Chapter 3.
Today oxygen constitutes about 21% of the atmosphere, 85.8% of the ocean, and 46.7% by vol -
ume of the earth’s crust. It has not always been like that. The primordial atmosphere of the earth is 
thought to have contained mainly CO2, N2, H2O, and CO with traces of H2, HCN, H2S, and NH3, 
but to have been devoid of O2 (only small amounts were derived from the photolysis of water), thus 
being neutral to mildly reducing. Today, the atmosphere contains 78% N2, 21% O2, and 0.036% CO2 
by volume and is strongly oxidizing. All of the molecular oxygen present in the earth’s atmosphere 
has been produced as the result of oxygenic photosynthesis, the source of the original O2 being pho -
tosynthetic activity in the primordial oceans. The development of aquatic photosynthesis coincided 
with a long and reasonably steady drawdown of atmospheric CO2, from concentration approximately 
100-fold higher than in the present-day atmosphere to approximately half of the present levels. This 
drawdown was accompanied by a simultaneous evolution of oxygen from nil to approximately 21%, 
comparable to that of the present day. The current atmospheric oxygen concentration is maintained 215 Biogeochemical Role of Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCin equilibrium between the production by photosynthesis and the consumption by respiration, with 
annual fluctuations of ±0.002%. Over geological time scales, the drawdown of CO2 was not stoichio -
metrically proportional to the accumulation of O2 because photosynthesis and respiration are but two 
of the many biological and chemical processes that affect the atmospheric concentrations of these 
two gases. The removal rate of CO2 from the atmosphere by photosynthesis on land is about 60 giga-
tons C year −1, worldwide. The concentration of oxygen in the oceans (85.8%) is influenced horizon -
tally and vertically by physical features such as the thermocline (i.e., a layer in a large body of water, 
such as a lake, that sharply separates regions differing in temperature), which isolates deep water 
from exchange with the atmosphere and can be a zone of significant decomposition causing an oxy -
gen minimum. Oxygen is only sparingly soluble in water (oxygen solubility is inversely proportional 
to the temperature) and diffuses about 104 times more slowly in water than air. Deep water masses 
are produced at the sea surface in the polar zones where cooling gives rise to increased gas solubility 
and convection currents. These waters remain largely intact and move through the ocean basins with 
their oxygen concentration decreasing with time due to the decomposition of organic matter.
Carbon, the key element of all life on earth, has a complex global cycle that involves both physi -
cal and biological processes, made up of carbon flows passing back and forth among four main 
natural reservoirs of stored carbon: the atmosphere, storing 735 gigatons (0.0011%) of the world’s 
carbon as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), longer chain volatile 
hydrocarbons, and halogen compounds (CFC and HCFC compounds); terrestrial biosphere, storing 
2000 gigatons (0.0032%) of the world’s carbon as compounds such as fats, carbohydrates, and pro -
teins; the hydrosphere, storing 39,000 gigatons (0.063%) of the world’s carbon, as dissolved carbon 
dioxide; the lithosphere, storing 1000 gigatons (0.002%) of the world’s carbon in the form of fossils 
(e.g., oil, natural gas, lignite, and coal), and 62,000,000 gigatons (99.9%) in sedimentary rocks (e.g., 
limestone and dolomite). Carbon is also present in the mineral soil, in the bottom sediments of water 
bodies, in peat in bogs and mires, in the litter and humus, which contain 3000 gigatons (0.0048%) 
of the world’s carbon.
Carbon dioxide enters the ocean from the atmosphere because it is highly soluble in water; in the 
sea, free dissolved CO2 combines with water and ionizes to form bicarbonate and carbonate ions, 
according to the following equilibrium:
 CO2 + OH–
CO32– + H+CO2 + H2OH2CO3 HCO3– + H+
 (5.8)
These ions are bound forms of carbon dioxide and they (especially bicarbonate) represent by far 
the greatest proportion of dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater. On average, there are about 45 mL 
of total CO2 in 1 L of seawater, but because of the equilibrium chemical reactions shown above, 
nearly all of this occurs as bound bicarbonate and carbonate ions which thus act as a reservoir of 
free CO2. The amount of dissolved CO2 occurring as gas in 1 L of seawater is about 0.23 mL. When 
free CO2 is removed by photosynthesis, the reaction shifts to the left and the bound ionic forms 
release more free CO2; so, even when there is a lot of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is never a limit -
ing factor to plant production. Conversely, when CO2 is released by the respiration of algae, plants, 
bacteria, and animals, more bicarbonate and carbonate ions are produced.
According to the general chemical reactions shown above, the pH of seawater is largely regulated 
by the concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate, and the pH is usually 8 ± 0.5. The seawater acts 
as a buffered solution, since when CO2 is added to seawater due to mineralization processes and res -
piration, the number of hydrogen ions increases and the pH goes down (the solution becomes more 
acidic). If CO2 is removed from water by photosynthesis, the reverse happens and the pH is elevated.216 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCSome marine organisms combine calcium with carbonate ions in the process of calcification to 
manufacture calcareous skeletal material. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) may either be in the form of 
calcite or aragonite, the latter being a more soluble form. After death, this skeletal material sinks 
and is either dissolved, in which case CO2 is again released into the water, or it becomes buried 
in sediments, in which case the bound CO2 is removed from the carbon cycle. The amount of 
CO2 taken up in the carbonate skeletons of marine organisms has been, over geological time, the 
largest mechanism for absorbing CO2. At present, it is estimated that about 50 × 1015 tons of CO2 
occurs as limestone, 12 × 1015 tons in organic sediments, and 38 × 1012 tons as dissolved inorganic 
carbonate.
Calcification is not confined to a specific phylogenetically distinct group of organisms, but 
evolved (apparently independently) several times in marine organisms. Carbonate sediments blan -
ket much of the Atlantic Basin and are formed from the shells of both coccolithophorids and 
foraminifera. As the crystal structure of the carbonates in both groups is calcite (as opposed to 
the more diagenically susceptible aragonite), the preservation of these minerals and their co-pre -
cipitating trace elements provides an invaluable record of ocean history. Although on geological 
time scales, huge amounts of carbon are stored in the lithosphere as carbonates, on ecological time 
scales, carbonate formation depletes the oceans of Ca2+, and in so doing, potentiates the efflux of 
CO2 from the oceans to the atmosphere. This calcification process can be summarized by the fol -
lowing reaction:
 Ca HCOC aCOC OH O2
33 22 2+−+↔ ++  (5.9)
Among the marine organisms responsible for calcification, coccolithophores play a major role, 
especially Emiliania huxleyi . When the blooms of this haptophyte appear over large expanses of the 
ocean (white water phenomenon), myriad effects on the water and on the atmosphere above can be 
observed. Although each cell is invisibly small, there can be as many as a thousand billion billion 
(1021) of them in a large bloom, and the population as a whole has an enormous impact. E. huxley  
blooms are processed through the food web, with viruses, bacteria, and zooplankton all contribut -
ing to the demise and decomposition of blooms. Some debris from the bloom survives to sink to 
the ocean floor, taking chemicals out of the water column. While they live and when they die, the 
phytoplankton cells leak chemicals into the water. A bloom can be thought of as a massive chemical 
factory, extracting dissolved carbon dioxide, nitrate, phosphate, etc. from the water, and at the same 
time injecting other chemicals such as oxygen, ammonia, DMS, and other dissolved organic com -
pounds into the water. This chemical factory pumps large volumes of organic matter and calcium 
carbonate into the deep ocean and to the ocean floor. Some of this calcium carbonate eventually 
ends up as chalk or limestone marine sedimentary rocks, perhaps to cycle through the earth’s crust 
and to reappear millions of years later as mountains, hills, and cliffs. Coccolithophorids are primar -
ily found at low abundance in tropical and subtropical seas, and at higher concentrations at high 
latitudes in midsummer, following diatom blooms. Hence, export of inorganic carbon by diatoms in 
spring at high latitudes can be offset by an efflux of carbon to the atmosphere with the formation of 
coccolithophore blooms later in the year.
The contemporary ocean export of organic carbon to the interior is often associated with diatom 
blooms. This group has only risen to prominence over the past 40 million years.
Coccolithophorid abundance generally increases through the Mesozoic and undergoes a culling 
at the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary, followed by numerous alterations in the Cenozoic. The 
changes in the coccolithophorid abundances appear to trace eustatic sea-level variations, suggesting 
that the transgressions lead to higher calcium carbonate fluxes. In contrast, diatom sedimentation 
increases with regressions and since the K/T impact, diatoms have generally replaced coccolitho -
phorids as ecologically important eukaryotic phytoplankton. On much finer time scales, during 
the Pleistocene, it would appear that interglacial periods favor coccolithophorid abundance, while 
glacial periods favor diatoms. The factors that lead to glacial–interglacial variations between these 217 Biogeochemical Role of Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCtwo functional groups are relevant to elucidating their distributions in the contemporary ecological 
setting of the ocean.
Coccolithophores influence regional and global temperature, since they can affect ocean albedo 
and ocean heat retention, and can have a greenhouse effect. Coccoliths do not absorb photons, but they 
are still optically important since they act like tiny reflecting surfaces, diffusely reflecting the photons.
A typical coccolith bloom (containing 100 mg m−3 of calcite carbon) can increase the ocean 
albedo from 7.5 to 9.7%. If each bloom is assumed to persist for about a month, then an annual cov -
erage of 1.4 × 106 km2 will increase the global annual average planetary albedo by

where 510 × 106 km2 is the surface area of the earth.
This is a lower bound on the total impact, because light-scattering of sub-bloom coccolith con -
centration will have an impact, over much larger areas (estimated maximum albedo impact = 0.21%). 
A 0.001% albedo change corresponds to a 0.002 W m−2 reduction in incoming solar energy, whereas 
an albedo change of 0.21% causes a reduction of 0.35 W m−2. These two numbers can be com -
pared to the forcing due to anthropogenic addition of CO2 since the 1700s, estimated to be about 
2.5 W m−2. Coccolith light scattering is therefore a factor of only secondary importance in the radia -
tive budget of the earth. However, the scattering caused by coccoliths causes more heat and light 
than usual to be pushed back into the atmosphere; it causes more of the remaining heat to be trapped 
near to the ocean surface and only allows a much smaller fraction of the total heat to penetrate to 
deeper in the water. Because it is the near-surface water that exchanges heat with the atmosphere, 
all three of the effects just described conspire to mean that coccolithophore blooms may tend to 
make the overall water column dramatically cooler over an extended period, even though this may 
initially be masked by a warming of the surface skin of the ocean (the top few meters).
All phytoplankton growth removes CO2 into organic matter and reduces atmospheric CO2 (by 
means of photosynthesis). However, coccolithophores are unique in that they also take up bicarbonate, 
with which to form the calcium carbonate of their coccoliths (calcification process). The coccolitho -
phorid blooms are responsible for up to 80% of surface ocean calcification. In the equilibrium of cal -
cification process, an increase in CO2 concentration leads to calcium carbonate dissolution, whereas 
a decrease in CO2 levels achieves the reverse. While photosynthetic carbon fixation decreases the 
partial pressure of CO2 as dissolved inorganic carbon is being utilized, conditions favoring surface 
calcification by coccolithophorid blooms contribute to the increase of dissolved CO2.
The relative abundance of the components of the carbonate system (CO2, H2CO3, HCO3−, and 
CO32−) depends on pH, dissolved inorganic carbon, and the total alkalinity, and the equilibrium 
between the components can shift very easily from being in one of these dissolved forms to being 
in another. How much of the total carbon is in each form is determined mainly by the alkalinity 
and by the water temperature. When the seawater carbon system is perturbed by coccolithophore 
cells removing HCO3− to form coccoliths, this causes a rearrangement of how much carbon is in 
each dissolved form, and this rearrangement takes place more or less instantaneously. The removal 
of two molecules of HCO3− and the addition of one molecule of CO2 change the alkalinity and this 
indirectly causes more of the dissolved carbon to be pushed into the CO2 form. Although the total 
dissolved carbon is obviously reduced by removal of dissolved carbon (bicarbonate ions) into solid 
calcium carbonate, yet the total effect, paradoxically, is to produce more dissolved CO2 in the water. 
In this way, coccolithophore blooms tend to exacerbate global warming by causing increased atmo -
spheric CO2 (greenhouse effect), rather than to ameliorate it, as is the case when dissolved CO2 goes 
into new organic biomass. However, recent work shows that additional properties of coccoliths may 
make the situation yet more complicated. Coccolith calcite is rather dense (2.7 kg L−1 compared to 
seawater density of 1.024 kg L−1) and the presence of coccoliths in zooplankton fecal pellets and 218 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCmarine snow (the two main forms in which biogenic matter sinks to the deep ocean) causes them to 
sink more rapidly. Slow-sinking organic matter may also adhere to the surfaces of coccoliths, hitch -
ing a fast ride out of the surface waters. If organic matter sinks faster, then there is less time for it to 
be attacked by bacteria and so more of the locked-in carbon will be able to escape from the surface 
waters, depleting the surface CO2. Probably this co-transport of organic matter with coccoliths 
offsets the atmospheric CO2 increase that would otherwise be caused and makes coccolithophore 
blooms act to oppose global warming, rather than to intensify it.

Algal Culturing
COLLECTION, STORAGE, AND PRESERVATION
Algae grow in almost every habitat in every part of the world. They can be found on very different 
natural substrates, from animals (snails, crabs, sloths, turtles, etc. are algal hosts) to plants (tree 
trunks, branches and leaves, water plants, and macroalgae), from springs and rivers to hypersaline 
lagoons and salt lakes. They also colonize artificial habitats, such as dams and reservoirs, fountains 
and pools, and cans, bottles, plant pots, or dishes all allow algae to extend their natural range. 
The ubiquity of these organisms together with the plasticity of their metabolic requirements makes 
many algal species easily available for investigation, collection, or simple observation.
Floating microalgae can be collected with a mesh net (e.g., with 25–30- μm pores) or, if in suf -
ficient quantity (i.e., coloring the water), by simply scooping a jar through the water. A small amount 
of the bottom sediments will also provide many of the algal species that live in or on these sedi -
ments. Some algae live attached to other types of substrates, such as dead leaves, twigs, and any 
underwater plants that may be growing in the water. Macroalgae and the attached microalgae can 
either be collected by hand or by using a knife, including part or all of the substrate (rock, plant, 
wood, etc.) if possible. Algae growing on soil are difficult to collect and study, many requiring cul -
turing before sufficient and suitable materials are available for identification.
Any sample should be labeled with standard information such as the locality, date of collection, 
and as many of the following features as possible: whether the water is saline, brackish, or fresh; 
whether the collection site is terrestrial, or a river, stream, or lake; whether the alga is submerged 
during water level fluctuations or floods; whether the water is muddy or polluted; whether the alga is 
free floating or attached, and if the latter, the type of substrate to which it is attached; and the color, 
texture, and size of the alga. Algae can be stored initially in a glass jar, a plastic bottle, or a bag, or in 
a vial with some water from the collecting site. The container should be left open or only half-filled 
with liquid, and wide shallow containers are better than narrow deep jars. If refrigerated or kept on 
ice soon after collecting, most algae can be kept alive for short periods (a day or two). If relatively 
sparse in the sample, some algae can continue to grow in an open dish stored in a cool place with 
reduced light. For long-term storage, specimens can be preserved in liquid, dried, or made into a 
permanent microscope mount. Even with ideal preservation, examination of fresh material is some -
times essential for an accurate determination. Motile algae must be examined particularly, while 
flagella and other delicate structures remain intact, since any kind of preservation procedure causes 
the detachment of the flagella.
Commercial formalin (40% formaldehyde in water), diluted between 1/10 and 1/20 with the col -
lecting medium, is the most commonly used fixative. As formaldehyde is considered carcinogenic, 
any contact with skin, eyes, and air passages should be avoided. This compound when mixed with 
other chemicals such as glacial acetic acid and alcohol (FAA 1–1–8 by volume: 40% formaldehyde 
1: glacial acetic acid 1: 95% alcohol 8) gives better preservation results for some of the more fragile 
algae, whereas the standard alcohol and water mix (e.g., 70% ethyl alcohol) will ruin all but the 
larger algae. However, FAA may cause thin-walled cells to burst.
Color is an important taxonomic characteristic, especially for cyanobacteria, and formalin is a 
good preservative for green algae, cyanobacteria, and dinoflagellates because cell color remains 
intact if samples are stored in the dark. Algae can be kept in diluted formalin for a number of years, 6222 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCbut the solution is usually replaced by 70% ethyl alcohol with 5% glycerin (the latter to prevent any 
accidental drying out).
Lugol’s solution is the preferred preservative commonly used for short-term (e.g., a few months, 
but possibly a year or more) storage of microalgae. It is excellent for preserving chrysophytes but 
it makes the identification of dinoflagellates difficult, if not impossible. Samples can be preserved 
and kept in dark bottles away from light for as long as 1 year in Lugol’s solution (0.05–1% by vol -
ume). The solution is prepared by dissolving 20 g of potassium iodide and 10 g of iodine crystals in 
180 mL of distilled water and by adding 20 mL of glacial acetic acid. Note that Lugol’s solution is 
affected by light and has a shelf-life of about 6 months.
Dried herbarium specimens can be prepared by “floating out” similar to aquatic flowering plants. 
Ideally, fresh specimens should be fixed prior to drying. Most algae will adhere to absorbent her -
barium paper. Smaller, more fragile specimens or tangled, mat-forming algae may be dried onto 
mica or cellophane. After “floating out,” most freshwater algae should not be pressed but simply 
left to air-dry in a warm dry room. If pressed, they should be covered with a piece of waxed paper, 
plastic, or muslin cloth so that the specimen does not stick to the drying paper during pressing.
To examine a dried herbarium specimen, a few drops of water are added to the specimen to 
make it swell and lift slightly from the paper. This makes it possible to remove a small portion of 
the specimen with forceps or a razor-blade.
Observations (preferably including drawings or photographs) based on living material are essen -
tial for the identification of some genera and a valuable adjunct to more leisurely observations on 
preserved material for other genera. The simplest method is to place a drop of the water including 
the alga onto a microscope slide and carefully lower a coverslip onto it. It is always tempting to put a 
large amount of the alga onto the slide, but smaller fragments are much easier to view under a micro -
scope. Microalgae may be better observed using the “hanging drop method,” that is, a few drops of 
the sample liquid are placed on a coverslip which is turned over onto a ring of paraffin wax, liquid 
paraffin, or a “slide ring.”
A permanent slide can be prepared using staining materials such as aniline blue (1% aqueous solu -
tion, pH 2.0–2.5), toluidine blue (0.05% aqueous solution, pH 2.0–2.5), and potassium permanganate 
(KMnO4; 2% aqueous solution), which are useful stains for macroalgae (different stains suit different 
species) and Indian Ink, which is a good stain for highlighting mucilage and some flagella-like struc -
tures. Staining time ranges from 30 s to 5 min (depending on the material), after which the sample is 
rinsed in water. Mounting is achieved by adding a drop or two of glycerin solution (75% glycerin and 
25% water) to a small piece of the sample placed on a microscope slide, then carefully lowering the 
coverslip. Sealing with nail polish is essential. This method is unsuitable for most unicellular algae, 
which should be examined fresh or in temporary mounts of liquid-preserved material.
Magnifications of between 40 × and 1000 × are required for the identification of all but a few algal 
genera. A compound microscope with 10 × to 12 × eyepiece and 4 × to 10 × to 40 × objectives is there -
fore an essential piece of equipment for anyone wishing to discover the world of algal diversity. An 
oil immersion 100 × objective would be a useful addition, particularly when aiming at identifying 
samples to species level. Phase-contrast or interference microscopy (e.g., Nomarski) can improve 
the contrast for bleached or small specimens. A dissecting microscope providing 20 ×, 40× up to 
60× magnifications is a useful aid but is secondary to a compound microscope. A camera lucida 
attachment is helpful for producing accurate drawings, whereas an eyepiece micrometer is impor -
tant for size determinations. Formulas for calculating biomass for various phytoplankton shapes 
using geometric forms and measurements and shape code for each taxa exist in the literature and 
are routinely used in the procedure for phytoplankton analysis that require biovolume calculations 
(Table 6.1). Scanning and transmission electron microscopes are beyond the reach of all except spe -
cialist institutions; however, they are an essential tool for identifying some of the very small algae, 
and also for investigating the details of their ultrastructure.
In an attempt to speed up the time-consuming procedure of classification by optical microscopy, 
several kinds of automatic analysis and microalgae identification methods were set up. They include, 223 Algal Culturing
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCfor example, a method based on algal cell morphology identification, absorption spectroscopy, fluo -
rescence spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatographic method, flow cytometric method, 
and gene probe method. Though automated classification of microalgae is a rather active field of 
research, commercial developments are limited.
Pioneering attempts in automatic classification of microalgal images were able to distinguish 
between few species of distinct size and shape using simple geometric features. To achieve higher 
classification accuracy, a hundreds of features, such as shape, moments, texture, and contours, and 
several classifiers, such as decision trees, Bayesian statistics, ridge linear regression, neural net -
work, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithm, were used. Unfortunately, most of the existing research 
systems are still adapted to identify few specific types of algae. This is mainly due to the difficul -
ties in choosing the correct feature pattern. The previously described techniques are very complex 
and limited in their applicability; very recently, an innovative software methodology that combines 
robust image segmentation, shape features extraction, centroid distance spectrum calculation, and 
characteristic color (i.e., pigment signature) determination which can offer a reliable, real-time rec -
ognition of multialgal samples has been developed. Introducing a categorization parameter never 
used before, that is, centroid distance spectrum calculation and the pigment fingerprint of each alga, 
combined with a very simple technology, this methodology has the capacity to obtain real-time 
recognition accuracy comparable to that obtained by a phycologist. This methodology needs only a 
simple hardware platform, which integrates an optical microscope equipped with a color CCD digi -
tal camera, a personal computer, and a commercial software such as Matlab. Images are processed 
according to the following flow of 5 operations:
 1. Image Acquisition  For image acquisition, slides from algae samples are prepared with -
out any kind of processing or fixation. All the color images are acquired with the highest 
accuracy, because image processing can remove unwanted information, not add new infor -
mation. All the objects present in the microscope field images undergo real-time process -
ing. Those corresponding to objects other than algae, such as debris, particles, detritus, 
overlapping cells, are discarded.
 2. Contours Detection  The amount of data of the acquired images is reduced by represent -
ing the algae with lengths and contours as descriptors.TABLE 6.1

rotation, and scaling, the contour is normalized, oriented following the maximum Feret 
diameter, and its points uniformly resampled.
 4.  Characteristic Color Identification  The color having greater Euclidean distance corre -
sponds to the chloroplast domain and is defined the alga characteristic color, that is, the 
color that represents the pigment signature of each algal group.
 5.  Classification of Images  All the features measured by the operations described so far are 
used to classify the microalgae according to a Classifier Algorithm that assign the sample to 
a specific database class. Each database class corresponds to an alga taxonomically recog -
nized by the expert at the genus and/or species level. The accuracy of the correct number of 
database classes and the correct assignment of the images to the different database classes 
using this methodology are close to 97%. Figure 6.1 shows the results of the application of 
the algorithms for contour detection on Gymnodinium acidotum  (Myzozoa, Dinophyceae) 
and characteristic color identification on Cyanophora paradoxa  (Glaucophyceae).
CULTURE TYPES
A culture can be defined as an artificial environment in which the algae grow. Theoretically, culture 
conditions should resemble the alga’s natural environment as far as possible; actually, many sig -
nificant differences exist, most of which are deliberately imposed. In fact, following isolation from 
the natural environment, algal strains are maintained under largely artificial conditions of media 
composition, light, and temperature. The imposition of an artificial environment on a cell popula -
tion previously surviving under complex, fluctuating conditions and following a seasonal life cycle 
inevitably causes a period of physiological adaptation and/or selection, during which population 
growth will not occur or is very slow.
Although contaminated algal cultures have previously been satisfactory for certain applications 
and experiments, modern experimental methods and application demand contaminants not to be 
present, and taxonomy and growth characteristics of the strains to be defined. Hence, for most 
purposes, algal cultures are maintained as unialgal, contaminant-free, or axenic stocks. “Unialgal” 
cultures contain only one kind of alga, usually a clonal population (but that may contain bacteria, 
fungi, or protozoa), whereas “axenic” cultures should contain only one alga and no bacteria, fungi, 
or protozoa.
To obtain a unialgal culture, a species must be isolated from all the rest; three major techniques 
borrowed from microbiology are available for obtaining unialgal isolates: streaking and successive 
plating on agar media; serial dilution; and single-cell isolations using capillary pipettes. Streaking 
is useful for single-celled, colonial, or filamentous algae that will grow on agar surface. Filaments 
can be grabbed with a slightly curved pipette tip and dragged through soft agar ( >1%) to remove 
contaminants. It is best to begin with young branches or filament tips that have not yet been exten -
sively epiphytized.
Many flagellates, however, as well as other types of algae must be isolated by single-organism 
isolations or serial-dilution techniques. A particularly effective means of obtaining unialgal cultures 
is isolation of zoospores immediately after they have been released from parental cell walls, but 
before they stop swimming and get attached to a surface. Recently released zoospores are devoid 
of contaminants, unlike the surfaces of most algal cells, but catching zoospores requires a steady 
hand and experience.
Sterile cultures of microalgae may be obtained from specialized culture collections. Alternatively, 
axenic cultures can be obtained by treating isolated algae to an extensive washing procedure and/
or with one or more antibiotics. Resistant stages such as zygotes or akinetes can be treated with 
bleach to kill epiphytes and then planted on agar for germination. It is usually necessary to try 
several different concentrations of bleach and times of exposure to find a treatment that will kill 
epiphytes without harming the alga. When diatoms represent the contaminating species, addition of 225 Algal Culturing

growth, since it disrupts silica deposition.
“Cleaning,” previously contaminated cultures, is a skilful and time-consuming process and 
could take several years in sizeable collections. Extensive measures must be taken to keep pure 
unialgal cultures chemically and biologically clean. Chemical contamination may have unquantifi -
able, often deleterious, and therefore undesirable effects on algal growth. Biological contamination 
of pure algal cultures by other eukaryotes and prokaryotic organisms in most cases invalidates 
experimental work and may lead to the extinction of the desired algal species in culture through 
out-competition or grazing. In practice, it is very difficult to obtain bacteria-free (axenic) cultures, 
and although measures should be taken to minimize bacterial numbers, a degree of bacterial con -
tamination is often acceptable.
If biological contaminants appear in a culture, the best remedy is to isolate a single cell from 
the culture with a micropipette and try to establish a new, clean clonal culture. Alternatively, the 
culture can be streaked on an agar plate hoping to attain a free of contaminants colony. Neither 
of these methods works well, however, for eliminating bacteria that attach firmly to the surface 
of microalgae. Placing a test tube of microalgal culture in a low-intensity 90 kHz s−1 ultrasonic 
water bath for varying lengths of time (a few seconds to tens of minutes) can sometimes physi -
cally separate bacteria without killing the algae, making it easier to obtain an axenic culture by 
micropipette isolation. Often, however, to achieve an axenic culture, antibiotics must be added 
to the growth medium to discourage growth of contaminating cyanobacteria and other bacteria. 
Best results appear to occur when an actively growing culture of algae is exposed to a mixture of 
penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin for around 24 h. This drastically reduces the growth of 
bacteria while allowing the microalgae to continue to grow, increasing the chances of obtaining 
an axenic cell when using micropipette or agar streaking isolation. Different algal species toler -
ate different concentrations of antibiotics, so a range of concentrations should be used (generally 
50–500‰, w/v). Other antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and bacitracin, can also 
be used. Antibiotic solutions should be made with filter-sterilized (0.2- μm filter units) distilled 
water into sterile tubes and stored frozen until use. Another approach is to add a range of antibi -
otic concentrations to a number of subcultures and then select the culture that has surviving algal 
cells but no surviving bacteria or other contaminants. Sterility of cultures should be checked by 
microscopic examination (phase-contrast) and by adding a small amount of microalgal culture 
to sterile bacterial culture medium (e.g., 0.1% peptone) and observing regularly for bacterial 
growth. Absence of bacterial growth does not, however, ensure that the microalgal culture is 
axenic, since the majority of bacteria do not respond to standard enrichments. In reality, there 
is no way of demonstrating that a microalgal culture is completely axenic. In practice, therefore, 
axenic usually means “without demonstrable unwanted prokaryotes or eukaryotes.” Some micro -
algal cultures may die when made axenic, probably due to the termination of obligate symbiotic 
relationships with bacteria.
The collection of algal strains should be carefully protected against contamination during 
 handling and poor temperature regulation. To reduce risks, two series of stocks are often retained, 
one which supplies the starter cultures for the production system and the other which is only sub -
jected to the handling necessary for maintenance. Stock cultures are kept in test tubes at a light 
intensity of about 1.5 W m−2 and at a temperature of 16–19°C. Constant illumination is suitable for 
the maintenance of flagellates, but may result in decreased cell size in diatom stock cultures. Stock 
cultures are maintained for about a month and then transferred to create a new culture line.
CULTURE PARAMETERS
A culture has three distinct components: the culture medium contained in a suitable vessel; the 
algal cells growing in the medium; air, to allow exchange of carbon dioxide between medium and 
atmosphere.227 Algal Culturing
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCFor strictly autotrophic alga, all that is needed for growth are light, CO2, water, nutrients, and 
trace elements. By means of photosynthesis, the alga will be able to synthesize all the biochemi -
cal compounds necessary for growth. Only a minority of algae is, however, autotrophic; many are 
unable to synthesize certain biochemical compounds (e.g., certain vitamins) and will require these 
to be present in the medium (for obligate mixotropy condition, see Chapter 1).
The most important parameters regulating algal growth are nutrient quantity and quality, light, 
pH, turbulence, salinity, and temperature. Optimal parameters as well as the tolerated ranges are 
species-specific; the different parameters may be interdependent and a parameter that is optimal for 
one set of conditions is not necessarily optimal for another.
Tempera TUre
The temperature at which cultures are maintained should ideally be as close as possible to the 
temperature at which the organisms were collected; for example, polar organisms ( <10°C), tem -
perate (10–25°C), tropical ( >20°C). Most commonly cultured species of microalgae tolerate tem -
peratures between 16°C and 27°C, although this may vary with the composition of the culture 
medium, the species, and strain cultured. An intermediate value of 18–20°C is most often employed. 
Temperature-controlled incubators usually use constant temperature (transfers to different tempera -
tures should be conducted in steps of 2°C per week), although some models permit temperature 
cycling. Temperatures less than 16°C will slow down growth, whereas those higher than 35°C are 
lethal for a number of species.
lighT
As for plants, light is the source of energy, which drives photosynthetic reactions in algae and in this 
regard intensity, spectral quality, and photoperiod need to be considered. Light intensity plays an 
important role, but the requirements greatly vary with the culture depth and the density of the algal 
culture: at higher depths and cell concentrations, the light intensity must be increased to penetrate 
through the culture. Too high light intensity (e.g., direct sunlight, small container close to artificial 
light) may result in photo-inhibition. Most often employed light intensities range between 100 and 
200 μE s−1 m−2, which corresponds to about 5–10% of full daylight (2000 μE s−1 m−2). Moreover, 
overheating due to both natural and artificial illumination should also be avoided.
Light may be natural or supplied by fluorescent tubes emitting either in the blue or in the red 
light spectrum, as these are the most active portions of the light spectrum for photosynthesis. Light 
intensity and quality can be manipulated with filters. Many microalgal species do not grow well 
under constant illumination, although cultivated phytoplankton develops normally under constant 
illumination, and hence a light/dark (LD) cycle is used (maximum 16:8 LD, usually 14:10 or 12:12).
ph
The pH range for most cultured algal species is between 7 and 9, with the optimum range being 
8.2–8.7, though there are species that dwell in more acid/basic environments. Complete culture 
collapse due to the disruption of many cellular processes can result from a failure to maintain an 
acceptable pH. The latter is accomplished by aerating the culture. In the case of high-density algal 
culture, the addition of carbon dioxide allows to correct for increased pH, which may reach limiting 
values of up to pH 9 during algal growth.
salini Ty
Marine algae are extremely tolerant to changes in salinity. Most species grow best at salinity 
slightly lower than that of their native habitat, which is obtained by diluting seawater with tap water. 
Salinities of 20–24 g L−1 are found to be optimal.228 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCmixing
Mixing is necessary to prevent sedimentation of the algae, to ensure that all cells of the population 
are equally exposed to the light and nutrients, to avoid thermal stratification (e.g., in outdoor cul -
tures) and to improve gas exchange between the culture medium and the air. The latter is of primary 
importance as the air contains the carbon source for photosynthesis in the form of carbon dioxide. 
For very dense cultures, the CO2 originating from the air (containing 0.03% CO2) bubbled through 
the culture is limiting and pure carbon dioxide may be supplemented to the air supply (e.g., at a rate 
of 1% of the volume of air). CO2 addition furthermore buffers the water against pH changes as a 
result of the CO2/HCO3− balance.
Mixing of microalgal cultures may be necessary under certain circumstances: when cells 
must be kept in suspension in order to grow (particularly important for heterotrophic dinoflagel -
lates); in concentrated cultures to prevent nutrient limitation effects due to stacking of cells and 
to increase gas diffusion. It should be noted that in the ocean, algae cells seldom experience 
turbulence and hence mixing should be gentle. Depending on the scale of the culture system, 
mixing is achieved by stirring daily by hand (test tubes, Erlenmeyer’s), aerating (bags, tanks), or 
using paddle wheels and jet pumps (ponds). Not all algal species can tolerate vigorous mixing. 
The following methods may be used: bubbling with air (may damage cells), plankton wheel or 
roller table (about 1 rpm), and gentle manual swirling. Most cultures do well without mixing, 
particularly when not too concentrated, but when possible, gentle manual swirling (once a day) 
is recommended.
CULTURE VESSELS
Culture vessels should have the following properties: nontoxic (chemically inert); reasonably trans -
parent to light; easily to clear and sterilize; providing a large surface-to-volume ratio (depending on 
organism).
Certain materials which could potentially be used for culture vessels may leach chemicals into 
the medium with a deleterious effect on algal growth. The use of chemically inert materials is par -
ticularly important when culturing oceanic plankton and during isolation. Recommended materials 
for culture vessels and media preparation include
• Borosilicate glass
• Polycarbonate
• Teflon
• Polystyrene
Culture vessels are usually borosilicate glass conical flasks (narrow- or wide-mouth Erlenmeyer 
flasks) of various volume (from tens of milliliters to 3–5 L) or test tubes for liquid culture, and agar 
cultures. Borosilicate glass flasks and tubes, which have been shown to inhibit growth of some spe -
cies, can be replaced by more expensive transparent polycarbonate vessels, which offer excellent 
clarity and good physical strength. Like borosilicate, polycarbonate is autoclavable, but it is expen -
sive and becomes cloudy and cracks with repeated autoclaving, undergoing some loss of mechani -
cal strength. Teflon is very expensive, and it is used only for media preparation, and polystyrene, 
the cheaper alternative to Teflon and polycarbonate, is not autoclavable. Polystyrene tissue culture 
flasks can be purchased as single-use sterile units (Iwaki, Nunc, and Corning) and used for transport 
purposes.
The vessels are capped by nonadsorbent cotton-wool plugs, which will allow gas transfer but 
prevent entry of microbial contaminants. A more efficient and costly way of capping is to use foam 
plugs or silicone bubble stoppers (bungs), which also allow efficient gas transfer; they are reusable 
and autoclavable. Glass, polypropylene, or metal covers and caps are also used for flasks and tubes.229 Algal Culturing
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCMaterials which should generally be avoided during microalgal culturing include all types of 
rubber and PVC.
MEDIA CHOICE AND PREPARATION
The correct maintenance of algal strains is dependent on choice of growth media and culture param -
eters. Two approaches are possible for selection of media composition:
• Theoretically, it is better to work on the principle that if the alga does not need the addition 
of any particular chemical substance to the culture media (i.e., if it has no observable posi -
tive effect on growth rate), do not add it.
• In practice, it is often easier to follow well-known (and presumably, therefore, well tested) 
media recipes, and safer to add substances “just in case” (provided they have no observable 
detrimental effect on algal growth).
When choosing a culture medium, the natural habitat of the species should be considered in 
order to determine its environmental requirements. It is important to know whether the environment 
is eutrophic, hence nutrient-rich, or oligotrophic, hence nutrient-poor, and whether the algae belong 
to an r-selected or a k-selected species. r-Selected species are characterized by a rapid growth rate, 
autotrophic metabolism, and a wide environmental plasticity, whereas k-selected species show a slow 
growth rate, mixotrophic, or photoheterotrophic metabolism, and a low environmental tolerance.
The media recipes currently available are not always adequate for many species, and the exact 
choice for a particular species therefore is dependent on trial and error. It must be remembered that 
there are (within limits) no right and wrong methods in algal culturing; culture media have been 
only developed trying out various additions, usually based on theoretical considerations. Refinement 
of media composition for laboratory-maintained algal cultures have been the object of research for 
several decades, resulting in many different media recipes reported in the literature and used in 
different laboratories.
Media can be classified as defined or undefined. Defined media, which are often essential for 
nutritional studies, have constituents that are all known and can be assigned a chemical formula. 
Undefined media, on the other hand, contain one or more natural or complex ingredients, for exam -
ple, agar, or liver extract and seawater, the composition of which is unknown and may vary. Defined 
and undefined media may further be subdivided into freshwater or marine media.
In choosing or formulating a medium, it may be important to decide whether it is likely to 
promote heavy bacterial growth. Rich organic media should be avoided unless the algae being cul -
tivated are axenic. For contaminated cultures, mineral media should be used. These may contain 
small amount of organic constituents, such as vitamins or humic acids and, in either case, provide 
insufficient carbon for contaminating organisms to outgrow the algae.
Culture collections have attempted to rationalize the number of media recipes and to standardize 
recipes for algal strain maintenance. In particular, the use of undefined biphasic media (soil/water 
mixture) is declining, due to lack of reproducibility in media batches and occasional contamination 
of the media from soil samples.
Media may be prepared by combining concentrated stock solutions which are not combined 
before use, to avoid precipitation and contamination. Reagent grade chemicals and bidistilled (or 
purer) water should be used to make stock solutions of enrichments. Gentle heating and/or mag -
netic stirring of stock solutions can be used to ensure complete dissolution. When preparing a stock 
solution containing a mixture of compounds, each compound has to be dissolved individually in a 
minimal volume of water before mixing, then combined with the others and the volume diluted to 
the needed amount.
Another practical way of preparing artificial defined media is to mix the ingredients together and 
dry them prior to long-term storage. Constituents are added sequentially to distilled water, smallest 230 Algae

salts, the pH is adjusted to be between 4 and 5. The mixture is then transferred to a clean desiccator 
of suitable size and the final additions are made. The well-stirred slurry is vacuum-dried, and the 
dry mixture is then stored with calcium chloride as a desiccant. It can be stored for some years if 
kept dry.
Solid media are usually prepared using 1.0–1.5% (w/v) agar, tubes being rested at an angle of 30° 
during agar gelation to form a slope that increases the surface area available for growth.
As said above, media are sterilized either by autoclaving at 126°C (20 min, 1 atm pressure), or 
by filtration, using 0.2- μm pore cellulose nitrate or acetate sterile filters. Generally, subculturing is 
performed using aseptic microbiological techniques; laminar flow cabinets, equipped with Bunsen 
flame, microbiological loops, and glass or plastic sterile pipettes are required.
Freshwa Ter media
Freshwater media are generally selected because they possess characteristics similar to the natural 
environment or they differentially selected for a specific algal component of the habitat. Artificial 
media, with known chemical composition, are often employed as additives to natural media with an 
unknown chemical composition, such as lake water, to enrich them. They are often used to simulate 
diverse nutritional or physical requirements of a particular species or groups of species, especially 
when the exact nutritional requirements are unknown.
Media are generally prepared from premixed stock solutions. Aliquots from these stocks are 
measured and added to a given volume of water. Some, however, must be prepared by weighting or 
measuring the desired components and adding them directly to a given volume of liquid. Accuracy 
in measuring liquid aliquots from stock solution or water, and weighing of chemicals is essential. 
Improper procedures may result in precipitation of one or more of the components of the medium, 
such as nitrates and phosphates, or failure of some of the constituents to go into solutions.
Stock solution can be prepared and stored at low temperature in tightly sealed glassware, since 
evaporation may alter initial concentrations.
Water generally employed for freshwater media should belong to one of the following types: 
copper-distilled water, single distilled water, double distilled water, membrane-filtered water, and 
deionized water. In most laboratories, single- or double-distilled water is routinely used, which can 
be deionized by passing it through a prepacked deionizing column.
Freshwater media can be “defined” and “undefined.” Defined medium such as Sueoka’s or 
Bold Basal Medium has been proved successful for many algal classes. Most of these defined 
media can be used for additional algal groups by adding a variety of other components or modi -
fying the amounts of certain reagents. These “undefined” media often have the advantage of 
supporting the growth of a large number of different algal species, but, when highly organic, 
they also have the disadvantage of encouraging more bacterial growth respect to strictly inor -
ganic media.
Some of the most commonly used freshwater media, defined and undefined, are listed in Tables 
6.2 through 6.12.
marine media
Seawater is an ideal medium for growth of marine species, but it is an intrinsically complex 
medium, containing over 50 known elements in addition to a large but variable number of organic 
compounds. Usually, it is necessary to enrich seawater with nutrients such as nitrogen, phospho -
rus, and iron. Synthetic formulations have been designed primarily to provide simplified, defined 
media. Marine species generally have fairly wide tolerances, and difficulties attributed to media 
can frequently be related to problems of isolation, conditions of manipulations and incubation, 
and physiological state of the organism. A single medium will generally serve most needs of an 231 Algal Culturing

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCinvestigator. Many media are only major variations of some widely applicable, and often equally 
effective. Whatever the choice, a medium should be as simple as possible in composition and 
preparation.
Media for the culture of marine phytoplankton consist of a seawater base (natural or artificial), 
which may be supplemented by various substances essential for microalgal growth, including nutri -
ents, trace metals and chelators, vitamins, soil extract, and buffer compounds.
The salinity of the seawater base should first be checked (30–35‰ for marine phytoplank -
ton), and any necessary adjustments (addition of fresh water/evaporation) made before addition of 
enrichments.
Seawater, stock solutions of enrichments, and the final media must be sterile in order to prevent 
(or more realistically minimize) biological contamination of unialgal cultures. Autoclaving is a pro -
cess that has many effects on seawater and its constituents, potentially altering or destroying inhibi -
tory organic compounds, as well as beneficial organic molecules. Because of the steam atmosphere 
in an autoclave, CO2 is driven out of the seawater and the pH is raised to about 10, a level that can 
cause precipitation of the iron and phosphate added in the medium. Some of this precipitate may 
disappear upon re-equilibration of CO2 on cooling, but both the reduced iron and phosphate levels 
and the direct physical effect of the precipitate may limit algal growth. The presence of ethylene -
diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and the use of organic phosphate may reduce precipitation effects. 
Addition of 5% or more of distilled water may also help in reducing precipitation (but may affect 
final salinity). The best solution, however, if media are autoclaved, is to sterilize iron and phosphate 
(or even all media additions) separately and add them aseptically afterwards.
Some marine microalgae grow well on solid substrate. A 3% high-grade agar can be used for 
the solid substrate. The agar and culture medium should not be autoclaved together, because toxic 
breakdown products can be generated. The best procedure is to autoclave 30% agar in deionized 
water in one container and nine times as much seawater base in another. After removing from the 
autoclave, sterile nutrients are added aseptically to the water, which is then mixed with the molten 
agar. After mixing, the warm fluid is poured into sterile Petri dishes, where it solidifies when it 
cools. The plate is inoculated by placing a drop of water containing the algae on the surface of the 
agar, and streaking with a sterile implement. The plates are then maintained under standard culture 
conditions.
SEAWATER BASE
The quality of water used in media preparation is very important. Natural seawater can be col -
lected near shore, but its salinity and quality is often quite variable and unpredictable, particularly 
in temperate and polar regions (due to anthropogenic pollution, toxic metabolites released by algal 
blooms in coastal waters). The quality of coastal water may be improved by ageing for a few months 
at 4°C (allowing bacteria degradation), by autoclaving (heat may denature inhibitory substances), or 
by filtering through acid-washed charcoal (which absorbs toxic organic compounds). Most coastal 
waters contain significant quantities of inorganic and organic particulate matter, and therefore must 
be filtered before use (using, e.g., Whatman no. 1 filter paper).
The low biomass and continual depletion of many trace elements from the surface waters of the 
open ocean by biogeochemical processes makes this water much cleaner, and therefore preferable 
for culturing purposes. Seawater can be stored in polyethylene carboys, in cool dark conditions.
Artificial seawater, made by mixing various salts with deionized water, has the advantage of 
being entirely defined from the chemical point of view, but it is very laborious to prepare and often 
do not support satisfactory algal growth. Trace contaminants in the salts used are at rather high con -
centrations in artificial seawater because so much salt must be added to achieve the salinity of full-
strength seawater. Commercial preparations are available which consists of synthetic mixes of the 
major salts present in natural sea water, such as sea salts produced by Tropic Marine® in Germany 
and by Instant Ocean in Virgina (USA).241 Algal Culturing

The term “nutrient” is colloquially applied to a chemical required in relatively large quantities, but 
can be used for any element or compound necessary for algal growth.
The average concentrations of constituents of potential biological importance found in typical 
seawater is shown in Table 6.13. These nutrients can be divided into three groups, I, II, and III, with 
decreasing concentration.
• Group I : concentrations of these constituents exhibit essentially no variation in seawater, 
and high algal biomass cannot deplete them in culture media. These constituents do not,

added to deionized water when making artificial seawater media.
• Group II : these elements also have quite constant concentrations in seawater or vary by a 
factor <5. Because microalgal biomass cannot deplete their concentrations significantly, 
they also do not need to be added to natural seawater media. Standard artificial media 
(and some natural seawater media) add molybdenum (as molybdate), an essential nutri -
ent for algae, selenium (as selenite), which has been demonstrated to be needed by some 
algae, as well as strontium, bromide, and fluoride, all of which occur at relatively high 
concentrations in seawater, but none of which has been shown to be essential for micro -
algal growth.
• Group III : microalgae need all these elements (silicon is needed only by diatoms and some 
chrysophytes, and nickel is only known to be needed to form urease when algae are using 
urea as a nitrogen source). These nutrients are generally present at low concentrations in 
natural seawater, and since microalgae take up substantial amounts of them, concentra -
tions vary widely (generally by a factor of 10–1000). All of these nutrients (except silicon 
and nickel in some circumstances) generally need to be added to culture media in order to 
generate significant microalgal biomass.
Nitrate is the nitrogen source most often used in culture media, but ammonium can also be used, 
and indeed it is the preferential form for many algae since it does not have to be reduced prior to 
amino acid synthesis, the point of primary intracellular nitrogen assimilation into the organic link -
age. Ammonium concentrations >25 μM are, however, often reported to be toxic to phytoplankton, 
hence, ammonium concentrations should be kept low.
Inorganic (ortho)phosphate, the phosphorus form preferentially used by microalgae, is most 
often added to culture media, but organic (glycero)phosphate is sometimes used, particularly when 
precipitation of phosphate is anticipated (e.g., when nutrients are autoclaved in the culture media 
rather than separately). Most microalgae are capable of producing cell-surface phosphatases that 
allow them to utilize this and other forms of organic phosphate as a phosphorus source.
The trace metals which are essential for microalgal growth are incorporated into essential 
organic molecules, particularly a variety of coenzyme factors that enter into photosynthetic reac -
tions. The concentrations (or more accurately the biologically available concentrations) of Fe, Mn, 
Zn, Cu, and Co (and sometimes Mo and Se) in natural waters may be limiting factors to algal 
growth. Little is known about the complex relationships between chemical speciation of metals 
and biological availability. It is thought that molecules complexing with metals (chelators) influ -
ence the availability of these elements. Chelators act as trace metal buffers, maintaining constant 
concentrations of free ionic metal. It is the free ionic metal, not the chelated metal, which influ -
ences microalgae, either as a nutrient or as a toxin. Without proper chelation, some metals (such 
as Cu) are often present at toxic concentrations, and others (such as Fe) tend to precipitate and 
become unavailable to phytoplankton. In natural seawater, dissolved organic molecules (generally 
present at concentrations of 1–10 mg L−1) act as chelators. The most widely used chelator in culture 
media additions is EDTA, which must be present at high concentrations since it mostly complexes 
with Ca2+ and Mg2+, present in large amounts in seawater. EDTA may have an additional benefit of 
reducing precipitation during autoclaving. High concentrations have, however, occasionally been 
reported to be toxic to microalgae. As an alternative, the organic chelator citrate is sometimes uti -
lized, having the advantage of being less influenced by Ca2+ and Mg2+. The ratio of chelator:metal 
in culture medium ranges from 1:1 in f/2 to 10:1 in K medium. High ratios may result in metal 
deficiencies for coastal phytoplankton (i.e., too much metal is complexed), and many media there -
fore use intermediate ratios.
In today’s aerobic ocean, iron is present in the oxidized form as various ferric hydroxides and 
thus it is rather insoluble in seawater. Although concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, zinc, and 
manganese in deep water are similar to plankton elemental composition, there is proportionally 20 243 Algal Culturing
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCtimes less iron in deep water than is apparently needed, leading to the suggestion that iron may be 
the ultimate geochemically limiting nutrient to phytoplankton in the ocean. Very little is known 
about iron in seawater or phytoplankton uptake mechanisms due to the complex chemistry of the 
element. Iron availability for microalgal uptake seems to be largely dependent on levels of chela -
tion. It is highly recommended that iron be added as the chemically prepared chelated iron salt of 
EDTA rather than as iron chloride or other iron salts; the formation of iron chelates is relatively 
slow, and iron hydroxides will form first in seawater, leading to precipitation of much of the iron 
in the culture medium.
Apparently as a result of the extreme scarcity of copper in anaerobic waters, copper was not uti -
lized by organisms until the earth became aerobic and copper increased in abundance. Consequently, 
copper does not seem to be an obligate requirement, algae either not needing it or needing in such 
a small amount that free ionic copper concentrations in natural seawater are sufficient to maintain 
maximum growth rates. Copper may indeed be toxic, particularly to more primitive algae, and 
hence copper, if added to culture media at all, should be kept at low concentrations.
The provision of manganese, zinc, and cobalt in culture medium should not be problematical 
since even fairly high concentrations are not known to be toxic to algae.
VITAMINS
Many planktonic algae are auxotrophic for one or more vitamins, that is, they lack one or more 
vitamin biosynthetic pathways and therefore must gather essential vitamins from the environ -
ment. Possession of a biosynthetic pathway means independence, at the cost of synthesis. A sur -
vey conducted on more than 300 algal species has shown that more than half required cobalamin 
(vitamin B12); about 20% of microalgal species need thiamine (vitamin B1), and <5% need biotin 
(vitamin B7) (Figure 6.2).
Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a cobalt-containing tetrapyrrole related to chlorophyll and heme. 
Cobalamin acts as a cofactor for enzymes that catalyze either rearrangement-reduction reactions 
or methyl-transfer reactions. In bacteria, there are more than 20 cobalamin-dependent enzymes,

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCincluding those important for methanogenesis, but in eukaryotes there are many fewer. Higher 
plants have no cobalamin-dependent enzymes and so neither utilize nor synthesize cobalamin.
Cobalamin appears to be important in transferring methyl groups and methylating toxic ele -
ments such as arsenic, mercury, tin, thallium, platinum, gold, and tellurium.
Biotin (vitamin B7) is a cofactor for several essential carboxylase enzymes, including acetyl 
coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase, which is involved in fatty acid synthesis, and so is universally 
required. The molecule consists of an imidazole ring fused to a sulfur-containing tetrahydrothio -
phene ring with a fatty acid side chain. In eubacteria, the first precursor for biotin synthesis is 
pimeloyl-CoA but the source of this differs among different species.
Like biotin, thiamine (vitamin B1) also plays a pivotal role in intermediary carbon metabolism. 
The active form of the vitamin is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is essential for all organisms. 
The cofactor associates with a number of enzymes involved in primary carbohydrate and branched-
chain amino acid metabolism, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, transketolase, α-ketoacid decar -
boxylase, and α-ketoacid oxidase. Thiamine consists of a thiazole and a pyrimidine moiety, which 
are produced in separate branches of the biosynthetic pathway before being coupled together to pro -
duce thiamine phosphate. This is then further phosphorylated to produce the active cofactor TPP.
It is recommended that these vitamins are routinely added to seawater media. No other vitamins 
have ever been demonstrated to be required by any photosynthetic microalga.
SOIL EXTRACT
Soil extract has historically been an important component of culture media. It is prepared by heat -
ing, boiling, or autoclaving a 5–30% slurry of soil in freshwater or seawater and subsequently filter -
ing out the soil. The solution provides macronutrients, micronutrients, vitamins, and trace metal 
chelators in undefined quantities, each batch being different, and hence having unpredictable effects 
on microalgae. With increasing understanding of the importance of various constituents of culture 
media, soil extract is less frequently used.
BUFFERS
The control of pH in culture media is important since certain algae grow only within narrowly 
defined pH ranges and also to prevent the formation of precipitates. Except under unusual conditions, 
the pH of natural seawater is around 8. Because of the large buffering capacity of natural seawater 
due to its bicarbonate buffering system (refer to Chapter 5), it is quite easy to maintain the pH of 
marine culture media. The buffer system is overwhelmed only during autoclaving, when high tem -
peratures drive CO2 out of solution and hence cause a shift in the bicarbonate buffer system and an 
increase in pH, or in very dense cultures of microalgae, when enough CO2 is taken up to produce a 
similar effect.
As culture medium cools after autoclaving, CO2 reenters solution from the atmosphere, but cer -
tain measures must be taken if normal pH is not fully restored:
• the pH of seawater may be lowered prior to autoclaving (adjustment to pH 7–7.5 with 1 M 
HCl) to compensate for subsequent increases;
• certain media recipes include additions of extra buffer, either as bicarbonate, Tris (Tris-
hydroxymethyl-aminomethane), or glycylglycine to supplement the natural buffering sys -
tem. Tris may also act as a Cu buffer, but has occasionally been cited for its toxic properties 
to microalgae such as Haematococcus  sp. Glycylglycine is rapidly metabolized by bacteria 
and hence can only be used with axenic cultures. These additions are generally not neces -
sary if media are filter-sterilized, unless very high cell densities are expected;
• the problem of CO2 depletion in dense cultures may be reduced by having a large sur -
face area of media exposed to the atmosphere relative to the volume of the culture, or 245 Algal Culturing
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCby bubbling with either air (CO2 concentration 0.03%) or air with increased CO2 con-
centrations (0.5–5%). Unless there is a large amount of biomass taking up the CO2, the 
higher concentrations could actually cause a significant decline in pH. When bubbling 
is employed, the gas must first pass through an in line 0.2- μm filter unit (e.g., Millipore 
Millex GS) to maintain sterile conditions. For many microalgal species, aeration is not an 
option since the physical disturbance may inhibit growth or kill cells.
Some of the most commonly used marine media, defined and undefined, are listed in Tables 6.14 
through 6.21. Table 6.22 indicates the algal classes that have been successfully cultured in the media 
included in this chapter.

STERILIZATION OF CULTURE MATERIALS
All vessels used for culture purpose should be scrubbed (abrasive brushes not appropriate for most 
plastics) and soaked with warm detergent (not domestic detergents, which leave a residual film 
on culture ware, but phosphate-free laboratory detergent), then rinsed extensively with tap water. 
After soaking in 10% HCl for 1 day–1 week (not routinely necessary, but particularly important 
for new glass and polycarbonate material), vessels should be rinsed extensively with distilled and 
finally bidistilled water, and left inverted to dry in a clean, dust-free place, or in an oven.
Sterilization can be defined as a process which ensures total inactivation of microbial life and 
should not be confused with disinfection, which is defined as an arbitrary reduction of bacterial 
numbers. The primary purpose of sterilization is to prevent contamination by unwanted organisms, 
but it may also serve to eliminate unwanted chemicals. Sterilization can be obtained by means 
of several methods, the choice depending not only on the purpose and the material used, either 
empty glassware/plasticware or medium-containing vessels, but also on the facilities available in a 
laboratory.
Several methods are available for sterilization of material, some of which can be used also for 
growth media:
• Gas such as ethylene oxide, EtO, finds the best application on heat-sensitive equipment 
on which steam autoclaving (sterilization with heat) cannot be performed. EtO sterilizes 
by alkylation, it substitutes for hydrogen atoms on molecules such as proteins and DNA, 246 Algae

mal life-supporting functions. This method is widely used for the sterilization of medical 
devices, but it is not a routinely available technique for algology laboratories. Moreover, 
EtO is a potent carcinogen.
• Dry heat; some laboratory use dry heat to sterilize empty vessels, putting the material in an 
oven for at least 3–4 h at 160°C; however, only higher temperature (200–250°C) guarantee 
an effective result. Vessels are covered with aluminum foil to maintain sterility on removal 
from the oven. This procedure is suitable only for few materials that stand high tempera -
tures, such as glass, Teflon, silicone, metal, cotton, etc.
• Autoclaving (moist heat) is the most widely used technique for sterilizing culture media 
and vessels and is the ultimate guarantee of sterility (including the destruction of viruses). 
A commercial autoclave is best, but pressure cookers of various sizes are also suitable. 
Sterility requires 15 min at 1–2 bar pressure and a temperature of 121°C in the entire vol -
ume of the liquid (i.e., longer times for larger volumes of liquid; approximately 10 min for 
100 mL, 20 min for 2 L, 35 min for 5 L). Flasks containing media should be no more than 
half full and should be left partially open or plugged with cotton wool or covered with 
aluminum foil or paper, since for sterility the steam must penetrate the material. Autoclave 
steam may introduce chemical contaminants; empty glass and polycarbonate vessels should 
be autoclaved containing a small amount of bidistilled water that is poured out (thus dilut -
ing contaminants) under sterile conditions immediately prior to use. Vessels should never 
be closed, because of the risk of implosion, using cotton wool bungs, or leaving screw caps 
slightly open. Ensure the heating elements are covered with distilled water, and the escape 
valve should not be closed until a steady stream of steam is observed. After autoclaving, the TABLE 6.22

Autoclave steam may contaminate the media (i.e., with trace metals from the autoclave tub -
ing). Autoclaving also produces leaching of chemicals from the medium receptacle into the 
medium (silica from glass bottles, toxic chemicals from plastics). Autoclaving in well-used 
Teflon or polycarbonate vessels reduces leaching of trace contaminants.
• Pasteurization (heating to 90–95°C for 30 min) of media in Teflon or polycarbonate 
bottles is a potential alternative, reducing the problems of trace metal contamination 
and alteration of organic molecules inherent with autoclaving. Pasteurization does not, 
however, completely sterilize seawater containing media; it kills all eukaryotes and 
most bacteria, but some bacterial spores probably survive. Heating to 90–95°C for at 
least 30 min and cooling, repeated on two or more successive days (tyndallization) may 
improve sterilization efficiency; it is assumed that vegetative cells are killed by heat 
and heat-resistant spores will germinate in the following cool periods and be killed by 
subsequent heating.
• Ultraviolet radiation (240–280 nm) is not often used for culture materials, because very 
high intensities are needed to kill everything in a medium such as seawater (1200-W lamp, 
2–4 h for culture media in quartz tubes). Such intense UV light necessarily alters and 
destroys the organic molecules in seawater and generates many long-lived free radicals 
and other toxic reactive chemical species. Therefore, seawater exposed to intense UV light 
must be stored for several days prior to use, to allow for the level of these highly reactive 
chemical species to decline.
• Sterile filtration is probably the best method of sterilizing certain media, especially seawa -
ter-based media, without altering their chemistry, as long as care is taken not to contami -
nate the seawater with a dirty filter apparatus. Sterilization efficiency is, however, to some 
extent, reduced compared with heat sterilization methods. Membrane filters of 0.2- μm 
porosity are generally considered to yield water free of bacteria, but not viruses. 0.1- μm 
filters can be used, but the time required for filtration of large volumes of culture media 
may be excessively long. The filtration unit must be sterile: for small volumes ( <50 mL) 
presterilized single-use filter units for syringe filtration (e.g., Millipore Millex GS) can 
be used; for volumes up to 1 L reusable autoclavable self-assembly filter units (glass or 
polycarbonate) with 47-mm cellulose ester sterile membrane filters (e.g., Millipore HA) 
can be used with suction provided by a vacuum pump; for larger volumes, in-line systems 
with peristaltic pump and cartridge filters may be the best option. Filter units (particularly 
disposable plastic systems) and the membrane filters themselves can also leak toxic com -
pounds into the filtrate. The first portion of filtrate (e.g., 5% of volume to be filtered) should 
be discarded to alleviate this problem.
Most stock solutions of culture medium additions can be sterilized separately by autoclaving, 
although vitamin stock solutions are routinely filtered through 0.2- μm single-use filter units (e.g., 
Millipore Millex GS), since heat sterilization will denature these organic compounds. Filter ster -
ilization of all additions may reduce uncertainties about stability of the chemical compounds and 
contamination from autoclave steam, but absolute sterilization is not guaranteed. Stock solutions 
can be stored in ultraclean sterile glass, polycarbonate, or Teflon tubes/bottles. In order to minimize 
effects of any microbial contaminations, all stock solutions should be stored in a refrigerator at 4°C, 
except vitamin stocks, which are stored frozen at −20°C and thawed immediately prior to use.
CULTURE METHODS
Algae can be produced according to a great variety of methods, from closely controlled laboratory 
methods to less predictable methods in outdoor tanks. Indoor culture allows for control over illu -
mination, temperature, nutrient level, contamination with predators and competing algae, whereas 253 Algal Culturing
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCoutdoor algal systems, though cheaper, make it very difficult to grow specific algal cultures for 
extended periods. Open cultures such as uncovered ponds and tanks (indoors or outdoors) are 
more readily contaminated than closed culture vessels such as tubes, flasks, carboys, bags, etc. 
Axenic cultivation can be also chosen, by using algal cultures free of any foreign organisms such 
as bacteria, but this cultivation is expensive and difficult, since it requires a strict sterilization 
of all glassware, culture media, and vessels to avoid contamination. These constraints make it 
impractical (and very expensive) for commercial operations. On the other hand, nonaxenic culti -
vation, though cheaper and less laborious, are more prone to crash, less predictable, and often of 
inconsistent quality.
Different types of algal cultures are used worldwide; the most routinely adopted being batch, 
continuous and semicontinuous, ponds, and photobioreactors.
baTch cUlTUres
The most common culture system is the batch culture, due to its simplicity and low cost. This is a 
closed system, volume-limited, in which there is no input or output of materials, that is, resources 
are finite. The algal population cell density increases constantly until the exhaustion of some limit -
ing factor, while other nutrient components of the culture medium decrease over time. Any prod -
ucts produced by the cells during growth also increase in concentration in the culture medium. 
Once the resources have been utilized by the cells, the cultures die unless supplied with a new 
medium. In practice, this is done by subculturing, that is, transferring a small volume of existing 
culture to a large volume of fresh culture medium at regular intervals. In this method, algal cells 
are allowed to grow and reproduce in a closed container. A typical batch culture set-up can be a 
250-mL Erlenmeyer’s culture flask with a cotton/gauze bung; in some cases, the bung can be fit -
ted with a Pasteur pipette and air is bubbled into the culture to maintain high levels of oxygen and 
carbon dioxide and provide mixing.
Batch culture systems are highly dynamic. The population shows a typical pattern of growth 
according to a sigmoidal curve (Figure 6.3a), consisting of a succession of six phases, characterized 
by variations in the growth rate (Figure 6.3b); the six phases are summarized in Table 6.23.
The growth curve, relatively to the phases 3–5, without the lag, acceleration, and crash phases, can 
be described with a rectangular hyperbolic function similar to the Michaelis–Menten formulation

and irradiance.
After the inoculum, growth does not necessarily start right away, since most cells may be viable, 
but not in condition to divide. The interval necessary for the transferred cells to adapt to the new 
situation and start growing is the first phase of the growth curve, the lag phase. This lag or induction 
phase is relatively long when an algal culture is transferred from a plate to liquid culture. Cultures 
inoculated with exponentially growing algae have short lag phases, which can seriously reduce the 
time required for up-scaling. The lag in growth is attributed to the physiological adaptation of the 
cell metabolism to growth, such as the increase in the levels of enzymes and metabolites involved 
in cell division and carbon fixation. During this phase, the growth rate is zero.
After a short phase of growth acceleration, characterized by a continuously increasing growth 
rate, up to its maximum value, which is achieved in the following exponential phase, the cell density 
increases as a function of time t according to the exponential function:
 NNtt
2121 =−em(), (6.1)
where N2 and N1 are the number of cells at two successive times t2 and t1, respectively, and μ is the 
growth rate. During this phase, the growth rate reached is kept constant. The growth rate is mainly 
dependent on algal species and cultivation parameters, such as light intensity, temperature, nutrient 
availability, etc.
The exponential growth phase normally lasts for a very short period, since cells start to shade 
each other as their concentration increases. Hence, the culture enters the phase of retardation and 
the cell growth rate decrease because mainly light, but also because of nutrients, pH, carbon diox -
ide, and other physical and chemical factors begin to limit growth. Following this phase, the cell 
population continues to increase, but the growth rate decreases until it reaches zero, at which point 
the culture enters the stationary phase, during which the cell concentration remains constant at its 
maximum value. The final stage of the culture is the death or “crash” phase, characterized by a 
negative growth rate; during this phase, water quality deteriorates, mainly due to catabolite accu -
mulation, and nutrients are depleted to a level incapable of sustaining growth. Cell density decreases 
rapidly and the culture eventually collapses.
In practice, culture crashes can be caused by a variety of reasons, including the depletion of a 
nutrient, oxygen deficiency, overheating, pH disturbance, or contamination. The key to the success TABLE 6.23

6 Decline Negative The duration of stationary phase and the rate 
of decline are strongly dependent on the 
kind of organisms255 Algal Culturing
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCof algal production is maintaining all cultures in the exponential phase of growth. Also, the nutri -
tional value of the produced algae is inferior once the culture is beyond phase 4 due to reduced 
digestibility, deficient composition, and possible production of toxic metabolites.
In batch cultures, cell properties such as size, internal nutrient composition, and metabolic func -
tion vary considerably during the above growth phases. This often makes interpretation of the 
results difficult. During the exponential growth phase, cell properties tend to be constant. However, 
this phase usually lasts only for a short period of time, and if one wishes to estimate growth rates 
of the exponential phase of batch cultures, daily sampling appeared to be insufficient to allow for 
a reasonably accurate estimate. Moreover, the accuracy of growth rate determination is highest in 
artificial, defined media when compared to cells grown in natural surface water media.
A significant advantage of batch culture systems is their operational simplicity. The culture ves -
sels most often consist of an Erlenmeyer flask with a sample-to-flask volume ratio of about 0.2, in 
order to prevent carbon dioxide limitation. This volume ratio is only critical if the flasks are shaken 
by hand once a day during the culturing run. If the flasks are cultured on a rotating shaker table, a 
sample-to-flask volume ratio of 0.5 is permitted.
Batch culture systems are widely applied because of their simplicity and flexibility, allowing to 
change species and to remedy defects in the system rapidly. Although often considered as the most 
reliable method, batch culture is not necessarily the most efficient method. Batch cultures are har -
vested just prior to the initiation of the stationary phase and must thus always be maintained for a 
substantial period of time past the maximum specific growth rate. Also, the quality of the harvested 
cells may be less predictable than that in continuous systems and, for example, vary with the timing 
of the harvest (time of the day, exact growth phase).
Another disadvantage is the need to prevent contamination during the initial inoculation and early 
growth period. Because the density of the desired phytoplankton is low and the concentration of nutri -
ents is high, any contaminant with a faster growth rate is capable of outgrowing the culture. Batch 
cultures also require a lot of labor to harvest, clean, sterilize, refill, and inoculate the containers.

In continuous cultures, resources are potentially infinite: cultures are maintained at a chosen point 
on the growth curve by the regulated addition of fresh culture medium. In practice, a volume of fresh 
culture medium is added automatically at a rate proportional to the growth rate of the alga, while 
an equal volume of culture is removed. This method of culturing algae permits the maintenance of 
cultures very close to the maximum growth rate, since the culture never runs out of nutrients.
Fresh growth medium is stored in a large vessel. Air is pumped into the airspace in this medium 
vessel. This air pressure will push the medium through a tube which is connected to the culture ves -
sel. By opening and closing the clamp on this medium line, one can add medium to the culture vessel. 
Air is also pumped into the culture vessel, passes down a long glass tube to the bottom of the culture, 
and bubbles up. This keeps the culture well suspended as well as high in oxygen and CO2. The air 
flowing into the culture vessel flows out through an outflow tube. As fresh medium is added, the level 
of the liquid in the culture vessel rises; when the level reaches the bottom of the outflow tube, old 
medium and cells flow out of the culture vessel into a waste flask. There is another glass tube in the 
culture vessel, the sample port. When a sample of cells from the culture vessel is needed, the clamp 
on the sample port can be opened up and medium and cells flow out.
Continuous culture systems have been widely used to culture microbes for industrial and research 
purposes. The early development of a continuous culture system can be traced back to the 1950s, 
when the first chemostat, also called bactogen, was developed.
Batch and continuous culture systems differ in that in a continuous culture system, nutrients are 
supplied to the cell culture at a constant rate, and in order to maintain a constant volume, an equal 
volume of cell culture is removed. This allows the cell population to reach a “steady state” (i.e., 
growth rate and the total number of cells per milliliter of culture remain constant).256 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCTwo categories of continuous cultures can be distinguished sensu  Fogg and Thake (1987):
• Turbidostat culture, in which fresh medium is delivered only when the cell density of the 
culture reaches some predetermined point, as measured by the extinction of light passing 
through the culture. At this point, fresh medium is added to the culture and an equal vol -
ume of culture is removed. The diluted culture increases the cell density until the process 
is repeated.
• Chemostat culture, in which a flow of fresh medium is introduced into the culture at a 
steady, predetermined rate. The latter adds a limiting vital nutrient (e.g., nitrate) at a fixed 
rate; in this way, the growth rate and not the cell density is kept constant. In a chemostat, 
the medium addition ultimately determines growth rate and cell density.
In many chemostat continuous culture systems, the nutrient medium is delivered to the culture at 
a constant rate by a peristaltic pump or solenoid gate system. The rate of media flow can be adjusted 
and is often set at approximately 20% of culture volume per day. Air is pumped into the culture 
vessel through a sterile filter. This bubbling air has three effects: it supplies CO2 and O2 to the cul -
ture, aids in circulation and agitation of the cultures; and pressurizes the head space of the culture 
vessel so as to provide the force to “remove” an amount of media (and cells) equal to the volume of 
inflowing media. The culture may be aseptically sampled by opening the clamp on a sample port. 
The magnetic stirrer and aeration help in preventing the cells from getting collected at the bottom of 
the culture vessel. A truly continuous culture will have the medium delivered at a constant volume 
per unit time. However, delivery systems such as peristaltic pumps or solenoid gates are inherently 
unreliable. In order to deliver exactly the same amounts of medium to several cultures growing at 
once, a “semicontinuous” approach can be taken.
The rate of flow of medium into a continuous culture system is known as the “dilution rate.” 
When the number of cells in the culture vessel remains constant over time, the dilution rate is 
said to equal the rate of cell division in the culture, since the cells removed by the outflow of the 
medium are replaced by an equal number of cells through cell division in the culture. The principal 
advantage of continuous culture is that the rate of dilution controls the rate of microbial growth 
via the concentration of the growth-limiting nutrient in the medium. As long as the dilution rate is 
lower than the maximum growth rate attainable by the algal species, the cell density will increase 
to a point at which the cell division rate (birth rate) exactly balances the cell washout rate (death 
rate). This steady-state cell density is also characterized by a constancy of all metabolic and growth 
parameters. On the other hand, if the dilution rate exceeds the maximum cell division rate, then 
the cells are removed faster than they are produced and total washout of the entire cell population 
eventually occurs.
The disadvantages of the continuous system are its relatively high cost and complexity. The 
requirements for constant illumination and temperature mostly restrict continuous systems to 
indoors and this is only feasible for relatively small production scales. Continuous cultures have 
the advantages of producing algae of more predictable quality. Furthermore, they are amenable 
to technological control and automation, which in turn increases the reliability of the system and 
reduces the need for labor.
semicon TinUoUs cUlTUres
In a semicontinuous system, the fresh medium is delivered to the culture all at once, by simply 
opening a valve in the medium delivery line. Fresh medium flows into the culture vessel, and spent 
culture flows out into a collecting vessel. Once the required medium has entered the culture, the 
valve is closed, and the culture is allowed to grow for 24 h, when the procedure is repeated. The 
semicontinuous technique prolongs the use of large tank cultures by partial periodic harvesting 
followed immediately by topping up to the original volume and supplementing with nutrients to 257 Algal Culturing
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCachieve the original level of enrichment. The culture is grown up again, partially harvested, etc. 
Semicontinuous cultures may be indoors or outdoors, but usually their duration is unpredictable. 
Competitors, predators, and/or contaminants and metabolites eventually build up, rendering the 
culture unsuitable for further use. Since the culture is not harvested completely, the semicontinuous 
method yields more algae than the batch method for a given tank size.
commercial -scale cUlTUres
Existing commercial microalgae culture systems range in volume from about 102 L to more than 
109 L. However, aside from the specialized small-scale culture systems ( <1000 L), other types of 
culture systems predominate: large open ponds, circular ponds with a rotating arm to mix the cul -
tures, raceway ponds, or large bags.
There are several considerations as to which culture system to use. Factors to be considered 
include: the biology of the alga, the cost of land, labor, energy, water, nutrients, climate (if the cul -
ture is outdoors), and the type of final product. The various large-scale culture systems also need 
to be compared on their basic properties such as their light utilization efficiency, ability to control 
temperature, the hydrodynamic stress placed on the algae, the ability to maintain the culture unial -
gal, and/or axenic and how easy they are to scale up from laboratory scale to large scale. The final 
choice of the system is almost always a compromise between all of these considerations to achieve 
an economically acceptable outcome. Successful further development of the industry requires sig -
nificant improvements in the design and construction of the photobioreactors as well as a better 
understanding of the physiology and physical properties of the microalgae to be grown.
A common feature of most algal species currently produced commercially (i.e., Chlorella, 
Spirulina , and Dunaliella ) is that they grow in highly selective environments, which means that 
they can be grown in open-air cultures and still remain relatively free of contamination by other 
algae and protozoa. Thus, Chlorella  grows well in nutrient-rich media, Spirulina  requires a high pH 
and bicarbonate concentration, and Dunaliella salina  grows at very high salinity. Those species of 
algae that do not have this selective advantage must be grown in closed systems. This includes most 
of the marine algae grown as aquaculture feeds (e.g., Skeletonema , Chaetoceros , Thalassiosira , 
Tetraselmis , and Isochrysis ) and the dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii  grown as a source of 
long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as almost all other species being considered for com -
mercial mass culture. In the particular case of C. cohnii , a large-scale fermentation plant is operated 
by Martek Bioscences in Winchester (USA).
OUTDOOR PONDS
Different types of ponds have been designed and experimented with for microalgae cultivation, 
which vary in size, shape, materials used for construction, mixing device. Large outdoor ponds can 
be unlined, with a natural bottom, or lined with inexpensive materials such as clay, brick, or cement, 
or expensive plastics such as polyethylene, PVC sheets, glass fiber, or polyurethane. Unlined ponds 
suffer from silt suspension, percolation, and heavy contamination, and their use is limited to a few 
algal species, and to particular soil and environmental conditions.
Natural systems such as eutrophic lakes or small natural basins can also be exploited for microal -
gal production, provided suitable climatic conditions and sufficient nutrients are present. Examples 
are the numerous temporary or permanent lakes along the northeast border of Lake Chad, where 
Arthrospira  sp. grows almost as monoculture, and is collected for human consumption by the 
Kanembou people inhabiting those areas. Arthrospira  sp. naturally blooms also in old volcanic 
craters filled with alkaline waters in the Myanmar region. Production began at Twin Taung Lake in 
1988, and by 1999 increased to 100 tons per year. About 60% is harvested from boats on the surface 
of the lake, and about 40% is grown in outdoor ponds alongside the lake. During the blooming sea -
son in the summer, when the cyanobacterium forms thick mats on the lake, people in boats collect a 258 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCdense concentration of Arthrospira  in buckets. Arthrospira  is harvested on parallel inclined filters, 
washed with freshwater, dewatered, and pressed again. This paste is extruded into noodle-like fila -
ments that are dried in the sun on transparent plastic sheets. Dried chips are taken to a pharmaceuti -
cal factory in Yangon, pasteurized, and pressed into tablets ready to be sold.
Another cyanobacterium used as a food supplement is Aphanizomenon flos-aquae , which since 
the early 1980s has been harvested from Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, and sold as a food and health 
food supplement by Cell Tech International. In 1998, the market for A. flos-aquae  as a health food 
supplement was about $100 million with an annual production greater than 106 kg (dry weight). A. 
flos-aquae  blooms are often biphasic, with a first peak in late June to early July, and a second peak 
late in September to mid-October. The harvested biomass is screened and centrifuged to remove 
small extraneous material. The algal concentrate is then gravity-fed into a vertical centrifuge that 
applies high centrifugal force to separate cells and colonies, removing about 90% of the remaining 
water. At this stage, the algal product is 6–7% solids. Once concentrated, the product is chilled to 
2°C and stored before being pumped to the freezers. The frozen algae is then put into storage boxes 
and shipped to the freezer facility for storage. When needed, the frozen product is shipped to an 
external commercial freeze-drying facility to be freeze-dried into a powder containing 3–5% water 
content. This final product is processed into consumable products such as capsules or tablets.
Natural ponds that do not necessitate mixing, and need only minimal environmental control, 
represent other extensive cultivation systems.
The largest natural ponds used for commercial production of microalgae are D. salina  lagoons 
in Australia. Western Biotechnology Ltd. operates 250 ha ponds (semiintensive cultivation) at Hutt 
Lagoon (Western Australia); Betatene Ltd., a division of Henkel Co. (Germany), operates 460 ha 
unmixed ponds (extensive cultivation) at Whyalla (South Australia). Both facilities produce biomass 
for β-carotene extraction. Other facilities use raceway culture ponds, such as those operated by 
Cyanotech Co. in Hawaii and Earthrise farms in California for the production of Haematococcus  
and Artrosphira  biomass. In both cases, large raceway ponds from 1000 to 5000 m2 are adopted, 
with stirring accomplished by one large paddle wheel per pond. Raceway ponds are also used for 
intensive cultivation of D. salina  by Nature Beta Technologies Ltd. in Israel.
The nutrient medium for outdoor cultures is based on that used indoors, but agricultural-grade 
fertilizers are used instead of laboratory-grade reagents. However, fertilization of mass algal cul -
tures in estuarine ponds and closed lagoons used for bivalve nurseries was not found to be desir -
able since fertilizers were expensive and induced fluctuating algal blooms, consisting of production 
peaks followed by total algal crashes. By contrast, natural blooms are maintained at a reasonable 
cell density throughout the year and the ponds are flushed with oceanic water whenever necessary. 
Culture depths are typically 0.25–1 m. Cultures from indoor production may serve as inoculum 
for monospecific cultures. Alternatively, a phytoplankton bloom may be induced in seawater from 
which all zooplankton has been removed by sand filtration. Algal production in outdoor ponds is 
relatively inexpensive, but it cannot be maintained for a prolonged period and is only suitable for 
a few, fast-growing species due to problems with contamination by predators, parasites, and more 
opportunistic algae that tend to dominate regardless of the species used as inoculum. Furthermore, 
outdoor production is often characterized by a poor batch-to-batch consistency and unpredict -
able culture crashes caused by changes in weather, sunlight, or water quality. As stated above, 
at present, large-scale commercial production of microalgae biomass is limited to Dunaliella , 
Haematococcus , Arthrospira , and Chlorella , which are cultivated in open ponds at farms located 
around the world (Australia, Israel, Hawaii, Mexico, China). These algae are a source for viable 
and inexpensive carotenoids, pigments, proteins, and vitamins that can be used for the production 
of nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, animal feed additives, and cosmetics. Mass algal cultures in 
outdoor ponds are applied in Taiwanese shrimp hatcheries where Skeletonema costatum  is pro -
duced successfully in rectangular outdoor concrete ponds of 10–40 tons of water volume and a 
water depth of 1.5–2 m.259 Algal Culturing

An alternative to open ponds for large-scale production of microalgal biomass are photobioreac -
tors. The term “photobioreactor” is used to indicate only closed systems that do not allow for direct 
exchange of gases or contaminants between the algal culture they contain and the atmosphere. 
These devices provide a protected environment for cultivated species, relatively safe from contami -
nation by other microrganisms, in which culture parameters such as pH, oxygen, and carbon dioxide 
concentration, and temperature can be better controlled, and provided in known amount. Moreover, 
they prevent evaporation and reduce water use, lower CO2 losses due to outgassing, permit higher 
cell concentration, thus reducing operating costs, and attain higher productivity. However, these 
systems are more expensive to build and operate than ponds, due to the need of cooling, strict con -
trol of oxygen accumulation, and biofouling, and their use must be limited to the production of very 
high-value compounds from algae that cannot be cultivated in open ponds. Different categories of 
photobioreactors exist, such as axenic photobioreactors; tubular or flat photobioreactors; horizontal, 
inclined, vertical, or spiral; manifold or serpentine photobioreactors; air or pump mixed; single-
phase, filled with culture suspension, with gas exchange taking place in a separate gas exchanger, or 
two-phase, with both the gas and the liquid phases contained in the photostage.
The use of these devices dates back to the late 1940s, as a consequence of the investigation on 
the fundamental of photosynthesis carried out with Chlorella . Open systems were considered inap -
propriate to guarantee the necessary degree of control and optimization of the continuous cultiva -
tion process. Since the first vertical tubular reactors set up in the 1950s for the culture of Chlorella  
under both artificial light and sunlight, several types of photobioreactors have been designed and 
experimented with. Most of these are small-scale systems, for which experimentation has been con -
ducted mainly indoors, and only few have been scaled up to commercial level. Significantly higher 
photosynthetic efficiencies and a higher degree of system reliability have been achieved in recent 
years, thanks, in particular, to the progress in understanding the growth dynamic and requirements 
of microalgae under mass cultivation conditions. Notwithstanding these advances, there are only 
few examples of photobioreactor technology that has expanded from the laboratory to the market, 
proving to be commercially successful. In fact, the main obstacle remains the scaling-up phase, 
due to the difficulties of transferring a process developed at the laboratory scale to industrial scale 
in a reliable and efficient way. Two of the largest commercial systems in operation at present are 
the Klötze plant in Germany for the production of Chlorella  biomass and the Algatechnologies 
plant in Israel in Arava desert for the production of Haematococcus  biomass. Founded in 1998, 
Algatechnologies is a world leader in the production and supply of AstaPure, natural astaxanthin 
from Haematococcus pluvialis . The Algaltechnology closed system consists of a modular array 
of tubular photobioreactors based on glass tubes 300-km long set on 10 acres of arid desert land. 
Both plants utilize tubular, pump-mixed, single-phase photobioreactors; in particular, the Klötze 
plant consists of compact and vertically arranged horizontal running glass tubes of a total length of 
500,000 m and a total PBR volume of 700 m3. In a glasshouse requiring an area of only 10,000 m2, 
an annual production of 130–150 tons of dry biomass was demonstrated to be economically feasible 
under Central European conditions.
Other industrial plants actually operating are the plant built in Maui, Hawaii (USA) by MicroGaia 
Ltd. (now BioReal, Inc., a subsidiary of Fuji Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), which is based on a rather 
complex design, called BioDome™, for the cultivation of Haematococcus ; the rigid, plastic tubes 
photobioreactor of AAPS (Addavita Ltd., UK) and the flexible, plastic tubes photobioreactor of the 
Mera Growth Module (Mera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., USA).
cUlTUre oF sessile microalgae
Farmers of abalone ( Haliotis  sp.) have developed special techniques to provide food for the juvenile 
stages that feed in nature by scraping coralline algae and slime off the surface of rocks using their 260 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCradulae. In culture operations, sessile microalgae are grown on plates of corrugated roofing plastic, 
which serve as substrate for settlement of abalone larvae. After metamorphosis, the spat graze on 
the microalgae until they become large enough to feed on macroalgae. The most common species 
of microalgae used on the feeder plates are pennate diatoms (e.g., Nitzchia , Navicula ). The plates 
are inoculated by placing them in a current of sand-filtered seawater. Depending on the local condi -
tions, the microalgae cultures on the plates take between 1 and 3 weeks to grow to a density suitable 
for settling the larvae. As the spat grow, their consumption rate increases and becomes greater than 
the natural production of the microalgae. At this stage, the animals are too fragile to be transferred 
to another plate, and algal growth may be enhanced by increasing illumination intensity and/or the 
addition of fertilizer.
QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATIONS OF ALGAL DENSITY AND GROWTH
Although tedious, time-consuming, and requiring an excellence in taxonomic identifications, the 
traditional counting of phytoplankton is still unsurpassed for quantifying plankton, especially at 
low limits of detection. The examination and counting of preserved material also allows for direct 
observation and assessment of cell condition. The fundamental issue that must be addressed prior 
to choosing a counting technique is whether samples must be concentrated. The three routine meth -
ods used to concentrate phytoplankton samples are centrifugation and filtration for live samples 
and sedimentation (gravitational settling) for preserved samples. Centrifugation and sedimentation 
are the most commonly used, although filtration onto membrane filters is an effective procedure 
for fluorescence microscopic enumerations. If the cell density is less than 105 cells L−1, the sample 
needs to be concentrated; if cell density is too high to allow direct counting, the sample will be 
diluted. Dilution or concentration factors need to be taken into account for calculating the final cell 
concentration.
Species containing gas vacuoles (cyanobacteria) are unlikely to fully sediment despite the Lugol’s 
fixation. Two methods are available for collapsing vacuoles to assist sedimentation. Samples can 
either be exposed to brief ultrasonication ( <1 min, but may vary for different species) or alterna -
tively, pressure can be applied to the sample by forcing it through a syringe with a fine needle; this 
will collapse the vacuoles and the cells will then settle through gravity.
If the water sample contains a sufficient number of algae and concentration is not required, a 
direct count can be undertaken. The sample is thoroughly mixed, treated with a few drops of Lugol’s 
solution, mixed again, and allowed to stand for 30–60 min. The sample is mixed again and sub -
samples of it used for direct counting and taxonomic identification.
When concentration is required, a simple procedure for gravitational settling is to pour a well-
mixed volume of the sample of water containing the microalgae in a measuring cylinder (100 mL), 
add Lugol’s solution to it (1% by volume), and either allow the sample to stand overnight or use a 
centrifuge so that the cells sink. The iodine in Lugol’s solution not only preserves and stains the 
cells, but also increases their density. When the column of water appears clear, the top 90 mL will 
be gently siphoned off without disturbing the sediment at the base of the cylinder. This leaves the 
cells concentrated in the bottom 10 mL. Subsamples of this sedimented fraction can be used for 
counting procedure and examined under the microscope for identification, keeping in mind that the 
cells of the original sample have been concentrated 10 times.
At present, there are many kinds of counting procedures available for enumerating phytoplankton, 
depending whether counting algae in mixtures, as from field sampling, or unialgal samples, such as 
in growth or bioassay experiments in a laboratory. Some techniques are relatively “low-tech,” and can 
also be used in remote locations, other are “high-tech,” and require an expensive instrument.
The Sedgewick–Rafter counting chamber (Figure 6.4) is a low-tech device routinely used for 
counting algae in mixed assemblages. This chamber limits the volume and area of the sample to 
enable easier counting and calculation of phytoplankton numbers. It consists of a brass or polysty -
rene rectangular frame mounted on a heavy glass slide from which a precise internal chamber has 261 Algal Culturing
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCbeen cut; its dimensions are 50 × 20 × 1 mm3, with an area of 1000 mm2, and a volume of 1.0 mL. 
The base is ruled in a 1-mm grid. When the liquid sample is held in the cell by its large, rectangular 
glass coverslips, the grid subdivides 1-mL volume into microliters.
To fill the Sedgewick–Rafter chamber, the coverslip is placed on top of the chamber, diagonally 
across the cell, so that the chamber is only partially covered. This helps in preventing the forma -
tion of air bubbles in the cell corners. The coverslip will rotate slowly and cover the inner portion 
of the cell during filling. The coverslip should not float, nor should there be any air bubbles; the 
former results from over-filling, the latter from under-filling the chamber. In both cases, the depth 
of the chamber will be different from 1 mm, and the calculations will be invalidated. A large-bore 
pipette should be used to transfer the sample into the chamber; after filling, the coverslip is gently 
pushed to cover the chamber completely. The phytoplankton sample placed into the Sedgewick–
Rafter counting chamber is allowed to stand on a flat surface for 20 min to enable the phyto -
plankton to settle. It is then transferred to the stage of an upright light microscope and securely 
positioned, ready for counting.
Counts are done with the 4 × or (more usually) the 10 × objectives of the compound microscope 
(depth of field and lens length preclude the use of higher magnification objectives). A Whipple disk 
is inserted into one of the ocular lenses in order to provide a sample grid. It is necessary to first 
determine the area ( A) of the Whipple field for each set of ocular and objective lenses used. This is 
accomplished with a stage micrometer.
There are 50 fields in the length and 20 fields in the width of the chamber for a total of 1000 
fields. A horizontal strip corresponds to 50 fields. All cells within randomly selected fields are 
counted. A convention needs to be followed for cells or units lying on a boundary line or field, such 
as all cells or units overlapping the right-hand and top boundaries are counted, but those overlap -
ping the bottom and left-hand boundaries are not. The number of units per milliliter for each taxon 
is calculated according to following formula
 Number of cells m Lmm−=×131000C
ADF  (6.2)
where C is the number of cells counted, A the area of field in mm2, D the depth of the field 
(Sedgewick–Rafter chamber depth) in mm, and F the number of fields counted.
For colonial taxa, multiply the count of units by the average number of cells per unit and use 
the resulting value as C in Equation 6.2. To adjust for sample concentration or dilution, the result 
is divided or multiplied by the appropriate factor. To obtain total cell density per milliliter, sum all 
counts of individual taxa.
FIGURE 6.4  Schematic drawing of the Sedgewick–Rafter counting chamber.262 Algae

If cell density is low ( <10 units per field), counting of long transects to cover a large proportion of 
the chamber floor is more appropriate. Several transects with a width of a chamber field are counted. 
The number of strips depends on the required precision and the phytoplankton density. The number 
of cells per mm3 is calculated according to the following formula:
 Number of cells m Lmm−=×131000C
LDWS,
 (6.3)
where C is the number of cells counted, L the length of the strip in mm, D the depth of a field 
(Sedgewick–Rafter chamber depth) in mm, W the width of strip in mm, and S the number of strips 
counted.
To adjust for sample concentration or dilution, the result is divided or multiplied by the appropri -
ate factor.
A “high-tech” alternative to counting algae in mixed assemblages with the Sedgewick–
Rafter cell is the inverted microscope method. The expensive component here is the inverted 
microscope, whose great advantage is that settling chamber depth does not preclude use of 
high-magnification objective lenses. In 1931, Utermöhl solved the problem of concentrating and 
enumerating algae in mixed populations when he described a one-step settling and enumeration 
technique using the inverted microscope. The procedure involved the gravitational sedimenta -
tion of preserved phytoplankton into a counting chamber. This counting technique correctly 
assumed that phytoplankton would fall randomly to the bottom of the chamber and that counts 
would then be made on random fields or transects. The inverted microscope counting technique 
has gained broad popularity for phytoplankton enumeration. One of the advantages of this ran -
domized counting technique is its ability to calculate error estimates to verify the accuracy of 
the enumeration. Through the years, many modified chambers have been designed and used with 
the inverted microscope.
Special and expensive “Utermöhl” chambers can be purchased, but cheaper ones can be con -
structed from large coverslips, and plastic syringe barrels. If a lens with a long focal-length is avail -
able, chambers may be constructed from glass slides.
A measured volume of preserved sample is added to the settling chamber and allowed to settle 
for at least an hour. Time periods as long as 24–48 h are preferred especially, if small algae are pres -
ent in the sample (these will settle only very slowly). Upon settling, the upper portion of the chamber 
is removed and replaced with a glass plate. The sample is then transferred to an inverted microscope 
(condenser numerical aperture, 0.70; objectives, 25 × and 40 ×; oculars, 12.5 ×) with phase-contrast 
optics.
The sample is initially enumerated at 500 × using a random field technique. A minimum of 20 
random fields and 200 individual cells are enumerated. Additional fields are counted until the mini -
mum count is attained. When there are a large number of cells of a particular taxon in a sample, 
fewer than 20 random fields are enumerated with a minimum of five random fields examined for 
this taxon. Individual cells are enumerated, irrespective of whether in chains, filaments, or colonies. 
This allows for a more accurate estimate of biomass that is determined from the cell densities. Upon 
achieving 20 random fields and 200 individual cells, a low-magnification scan (25 ×) of 20 random 
fields is used to estimate the rarer, larger forms within the sample.
In the case of unialgal samples (unicells, small colonies, or relatively short filaments), chambers 
such as the haemacytometer, the Thoma chamber (Figure 6.5), the Fuchs–Rosenthal, or the Burker 
chambers are effective and commonly used for estimating the densities of cultures. The haemacy -
tometer was developed for counting cells in blood samples (now this is mostly done with electronic 
particle counters). Most of these counting chambers have delicate, mirrored surfaces that must not be 
scratched. Each mirrored surface has a grid etched upon the surface. In the case of Thoma chamber, 
each grid is composed by 16 fields of 0.2-mm side, separated by three boundary lines (Figure 6.6). 263 Algal Culturing

These 16 fields are further subdivided into 16 smaller areas each, for a total of 256 counting fields. 
The chamber is 0.1-mm deep; hence each grid holds exactly 64 × 10−3 mL of sample. You have the 
choice of counting the algae in the entire grid; counting algae in only one of the 16 squares, then 
multiplying by 16; or counting algae in an even smaller area, and multiplying accordingly.
When counting cells in the entire grid, that is, 16 fields, the cell concentration is calculated 
according to the following formula:
 Number of cells m L−=×1610
64C,
 (6.4)
where C is the number of cells counted.

Counts of about 30 cells per field are desirable for accuracy. If there are more than 30 cells 
per field, dilute the sample, or count algae in a lower number of fields and multiply. As for the 
Sedgewick–Rafter, a convention needs to be followed for cells lying on a boundary line or field, 
such as all cells overlapping the right-hand and top boundaries are counted, but those overlapping 
the bottom and left-hand boundaries are not (Figure 6.7). The counting process has to be repeated 
at least 10 times to determine an accurate mean.
“High-tech” methods for counting unialgal samples are the electronic particle counter (e.g., 
Coulter counter) and the digital microscopy. In spite of relatively high cost, an electronic particle 
counter is highly recommended for doing growth or bioassay studies that require many counts and 
high accuracy. In addition, the instrument will provide particle size/biovolume distributions. The 
principle of operation is that particles, suspended in an electrolyte solution, are sized and counted by 
passing them though an aperture having a particular path of current flow for a given length of time. 
As the particles displace an equal volume of electrolyte in the aperture, they place resistance in the 
path of the current, resulting in current and voltage changes. The magnitude of the change is directly 
proportional to the volume of the particle; the number of changes per unit time is proportional to the 
number of particles in the sample. When opened, the stopcock introduces vacuum into the system, 
draws sample through the aperture, and unbalances the mercury in the manometer. The mercury 
flows past the “start” contact and resets the counter to zero. When the stopcock is closed, the mer -
cury starts to return to its balanced position and draws sample through the aperture. Variously sized 
aperture tubes are available for use in counting variously sized particles; the aperture size is chosen 
to match that of particles.
Digital microscopy necessitates of a microscope equipped with a digital TV camera connected to 
a personal computer running dedicated application software for cell recognition and cell counting. 
It represents an automatic, reliable, and very fast approach to growth determination.

of the alga. Plots of number of cells against time (in days) can be made, and specific growth rate or 
growth constant ( μ) and division or generation time ( Tg) can be calculated from these curves.
A typical growth curve will show a lag phase, an exponential or log phase, and a stationary 
or plateau phase, where increase in density has leveled off (Figure 6.3a). In the stationary phase, 
growth is likely limited by resources such as light or nutrients. Growth rate ( μ) is calculated

Algae Utilization
INTRODUCTION
Micro- and macroalgae have been utilized by human for over hundreds of years as food, fodder, 
remedies, and fertilizers. The earliest record of seaweed utilization dates back to 13,000 years at a 
Late Pleistocene settlement in Chile; remains of marine algae belonging to the genera Durvillaea  
(Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae), Porphyra  (Rhodophyta, Bangiophyceae), Mazzaella  (Rhodophyta, 
Florideophyceae), Sarcothalia  (Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae), Gracilaria  (Rhodophyta, Florideo -
phyceae), Gigartina  (Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae), Macrocystis  (Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae), 
Sargassum  (Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae), and Trentepohlia  (Chlorophyta, Ulvophyceae) were recov -
ered from hearths and stone artifacts located in the remains of domestic huts at the archeological 
site of Monte Verde in southern Chile. All of the algae are edible and have important medicinal 
properties; hence, these findings suggest a strong reliance on coastal resources for food and medi -
cine of early humans in the Americas.
Other records show that people collected macroalgae for food as early as 500 bc in China and 
one thousand years later in Europe. Here, the earliest recorded account of seaweed use is in a poem 
dates back to 563 ad, dealing with the collection of seaweed by the monks of Iona, in the west of 
Scotland, to provide food for themselves and the poor.
Microalgae such as Arthrospira  (Cyanobacteria, Cyanophyceae) have a history of human con -
sumption in Mexico and Africa. In the fourteenth century, the Aztecs harvested Arthrospira  from 
Lake Texcoco and used to make a sort of dry cake called tecuitlatl , and very likely the use of 
this cyanobacterium as food in Chad dates back to the same period, or even earlier, to the Kanem 
Empire (ninth century).
Not only people migrated from countries such as China, Japan, and Korea, but also from 
Indonesia and Malaysia, where algae have always been used as food, have brought this custom with 
them, so that today there are many more countries all over the world where the consumption of 
algae is not unusual, including Europe.
On the east and west coasts of United States of America and Canada, around Maine, New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and British Columbia, some companies have begun cultivating macroal -
gae onshore, in tanks, specifically for human consumption, and their markets are growing, in both 
countries and with exports to Japan. Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Scotland are showing a renewed 
interest in macroalgae that were once a traditional part of the diet, especially for the Irish people 
during the potato famine after 1846. In addition to direct consumption, agars and carrageenans 
extracted from red macroalgae and alginates from brown macroalgae and microalgae have been 
included in a remarkable array of prepared food products, serving mostly to modify viscosity or 
texture. Global utilization of macroalgae is on the increase and, in terms of harvested biomass per 
year, macroalgae are among the most important cultivated marine organisms.
Currently, only 31 countries and territories are recorded with algae farming production, and 
99.6% of global cultivated algae production comes from just eight countries: China (58.4%, 11.1 mil -
lion tons), Indonesia (20.6%, 3.9 million tons), the Philippines (9.5%, 1.8 million tons), the Republic 
of Korea (4.7%, 901,700 tons), Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (2.3%, 444,300 tons), Japan 
(2.3%, 432,800 tons), Malaysia (1.1%, 207,900 tons), and the United Republic of Tanzania (0.7%, 
132,000 tons). Global production has been dominated by marine macroalgae, grown in both marine 
and brackish waters. Aquatic algae production by volume increased at average annual rates of 9.5% 7268 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCin the 1990s and 7.4% in the 2000s—comparable with the rates for farmed aquatic animals—with 
production increasing from 3.8 million tons in 1990 to 19 million tons in 2010. Cultivation has over -
shadowed production of algae collected from the wild, which accounted only for 4.5% of total algae 
production in 2010. The total value of farmed aquatic algae in 2010 was estimated at US $5.7 billion. 
A few species dominate algae culture, with 98.9% of world production in 2010 coming from Japanese 
kelp ( Saccharina japonica  syn. Laminaria japonica , Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae) (mainly in the 
coastal waters of China), Eucheuma  seaweeds (a mixture of Kappaphycus alvarezii  (Rhodophyta, 
Florideophyceae), formerly known as Eucheuma cottonii , and Eucheuma  spp.), Gracilaria  spp., nori/
laver  (Porphyra  spp.), wakame  (Undaria pinnatifida , Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae), and unidentified 
marine macroalgae species (3.1 million tons, mostly from China). The remainder consists of marine 
macroalgae species farmed in small quantities (such as Caulerpa  spp., Chlorophyta, Ulvophyceae) 
and microalgae cultivated in freshwater. Large-scale commercial production of microalgae biomass 
is limited to Arthrospira , Dunaliella  (Chlorophyta, Chlorophyceae), Haematococcus  (Chlorophyta, 
Chlorophyceae), and Chlorella  (Chlorophyta, Trebuxiophyceae), which are cultivated in open ponds 
at farms located around the world.
These algae are a source for viable and inexpensive carotenoids, pigments, proteins, and vita -
mins that can be used for the production of nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, animal feed additives, 
and cosmetics.
SOURCES AND USES OF ALGAE
hUman Food
Cyanobacteria
Some Nostoc  species are regionally being used as food and herbal ingredients. Ge-Xian-Mi  has been 
regarded as Nostoc sphaeroides ; however, its taxonomic identity remains controversial. This Nostoc  
species has been used as a delicacy for hundreds of years and is found in rice fields from December 
to May in Hubei, China. Colonies of Ge-Xian-Mi  are dark green and pearl-shaped, develop from 
hormogonia, and can reach 2.5 cm in diameter. Dried Nostoc  spp. balls are sold in Asian markets; 
they are stir-fried sautéed with oysters, and used in soups and as thickeners for other foods.
Another species is Nostoc flagelliforme  Bornet et Flahault, a terrestrial cyanobacterium that 
naturally grows on arid and semiarid steppes in the Northern and the Northwestern parts of China, 
where it is considered an edible delicacy with significant medicinal and great economic values. 
The Chinese have used it as food for about 2000 years, as told in an old text dating back to the Jin 
Dynasty ( ad 265–316). Its herbal values were recognized more than 400 years ago as recorded with 
other economic Nostoc  species in “Compendium of Materia Medica” of 1578. N. flagelliforme  is 
called Fah Tsai  (hair vegetable) in Chinese because of its hair-like appearance. However, the pro -
nunciation of Fah Tsai  sounds like another Chinese word that means to be fortunate and get rich. 
Therefore, it symbolizes additionally good luck. N. flagelliforme  has been consumed in China, 
especially in Guangdong, and among the overseas Chinese on account of its food and herbal values 
as well as its spiritual image.
Since this cyanobacterium has been collected and traded from old times, the resource is getting 
less and less, as the market demand increases with economic growth. People gather it by tools, which 
more or less destroy the vegetation, and in addition to this loss by harvesting, pasturing of cattle is 
rapidly diminishing the resource. On the other hand, exploitation of land has greatly reduced the area 
producing N. flagelliforme , and the quality of the product is degrading. Hence, recently the Chinese 
government has prohibited further collection for the sake of environmental protection.
Also Arthrospira  has a history of human consumption, which can be located essentially in 
Mexico and in Africa. About 1300 ad, the Aztecs harvested Arthrospira  from Lake Texcoco, near 
Tenochtitlan (today Mexico City) and used it to make a sort of dry cakes called tecuitlatl , which 
were sold in markets all over Mexico, and were commonly eaten with maize, and other cereals, or 269 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCin a sauce called chilmolli  made with tomatoes, chilli peppers, and spices. Very likely the use of 
Arthrospira  as food in Chad dates back to the same period, or even earlier, to the Kanem Empire 
(ninth century ad), indicating that two very different and very distant populations discovered inde -
pendently the food properties of Arthrospira . Human consumption of this cyanobacterium in Chad 
was reported for the first time in 1940 by the French phycologist Dangeard in the little known 
Journal of the Linnean Society of Bordeaux . He wrote about an unusual food called dihé and 
eaten by the Kanembu of Chad, and concluded that it was a purée of the filamentous cyanobac -
terium Arthrospira platensis . However, at that time, his report failed to capture the attention it 
deserved because of the war. In 1966, the botanist Leonard, member of the 1964–1965 Belgian 
Trans-Saharan Expedition, confirmed the observations of Dangeard. He reported finding a green -
ish, edible substance being sold as dry cakes in the market of Fort-Lamy (today N’Djamena, the 
capital of Chad). His investigation revealed that these greenish cakes, called dihé, were a common 
component of the diet of the Kanembu populations of Chad and Niger, and that they were almost 
entirely composed of Arthrospira , blooming naturally in the saline-soda lakes of the region. Like 
tecuitlatl , dihé was commonly eaten as a thick, pungent sauce made of chilli peppers, and spices, 
poured over millet, the staple of the region. In 1976, Delpeuch and his collaborators of ORSTOM 
(Office de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique Outre-mer, Paris, France) carried out a study on 
the nutritional and economic importance of dihé for the populations of the Prefectures of Kanem 
and Lac in Chad. The use of Arthrospira  by Kanembu was mentioned again in 1991 in a Canadian 
survey of food consumption and nutritional adequacy in wadi zones of Chad, which suggested that 
dihé makes a substantial contribution to vitamin A intake.
Arthrospira  is still harvested and consumed by the Kanembu who live around Lake Kossorom, 
a soda lake at the irregular northeast fringe of Lake Chad, in the Prefecture of Lac. Arthrospira  
is harvested from Lake Kossorom throughout the year, with a minimum yield in December and 
January, and a maximum between June and September during the rainy season. The bloom is pres -
ent as a thick bluish-green mat floating onto the surface of the lake only few hours a day, early in 
the morning. When the sun is high, the temperature of the water rises, and the bloom disperses, and 
therefore the harvesting begins at sunrise and it is over in about 2 h.
Only Kanembu women carry out the harvesting; men are banned from entering the water, since 
it is a deep-rooted belief that they would make the lake barren. The harvesting begins early in the 
morning, and the work is coordinated by an old woman (the captain), who is responsible for guard -
ing the lake even when the harvesting is over. Just before harvesting begins, the women form a line 
along the shore at positions assigned to them by the captain according to the village they come from, 
so as to avoid overcrowding in areas where the alga bloom is more abundant and where trampling 
and muddying of the water would reduce the quality of dihé. The harvesting is carried out accord -
ing to the rules and procedures handed down from mother to daughter from time immemorial. 
With their basins, the women skim off the bluish-green mat that floats at the surface of the water, 
especially along the shore, and pour it into twine baskets, which act as primary filters, or directly 
into jars (Figure 7.1a and b). In about 2 h, the harvesting is over, and the women move to sandy areas 
close to the lake for the filtration and drying of the alga. The women dig round holes, 40–50 cm 
in diameter and about 5-cm in deep, in the sand and line them with clean sand, which is patted to 
obtain a smooth, firm surface. The algal suspension is then carefully poured into the holes, and the 
surface of the biomass is smoothed with the palm of the hand. Within a few minutes, almost all of 
the extracellular water will have seeped out of the biomass, and the dihé is then cut into 8–10 cm 
squares, 1–1.5-cm thick, and removed from the holes as soon as it is firm enough for the squares to 
be handled without breaking (Figure 7.1c–f). The drying is completed on mats under the sunlight. 
Dihé  is traded in the local markets, and in the markets of the main towns of Chad, from where it can 
also be taken across the borders of Chad to Nigeria, Cameroon, and other countries. It is estimated 
that about 40 tons of dihé are harvested from this lake Kossorom every year, corresponding to a 
local trading value of more than US $100,000, which represents an important contribution to the 
economy of one of the poorest nations in the world.270 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCDihé  is mainly used to prepare la souce , a kind of vegetable broth served with corn, millet, or 
sorghum meal, which occasionally can have fish or meat as additional ingredients. Well-dried dihé 
is crumbled in a bowl either by hand or with a mortar and pestle; cold water is then added to dis -
perse the lumps, and the suspension is strained through a fine sieve to remove such solid impurities 
as sticks, grass, and leaves. The suspension is poured away from most of the sand that settles to 
the bottom of the bowl. The cleaned dihé is cooked for 1–1.5 h, which further disperses the lumps, 
yielding a bluish-green broth that still contains small amounts of plant debris and sand. This broth 
is transferred into a bowl, left to settle for 5–10 min to allow for sedimentation of any residual sand, 
strained very carefully once more, and then poured over sautéed onions. Salt, chili peppers, bouil -
lon cubes, and gombo  (Hibiscus esculentus , Malvaceae) are added, and la souce  is then simmered 
and occasionally stirred until cooked.
A minor utilization of dihé is as a remedy applied onto wounds to speed up the healing process, 
or as a poultice to soothe the pain and reduce the swelling of mumps.
Arthrospira  biomass has a high content of protein, about 55–60% of the dry matter, with respect 
to other food such as milk, eggs, etc. The proteins are low in lysine and sulfured amino acids such as 
methionine and cysteine, but their amount is much higher than in other vegetables, including legu -
mina. Phycobiliproteins represent a major portion of proteins, and among them phycocyanin can 
reach 7–13% of the dry matter; carbohydrates reach 10–20% of the dry weight and consist mainly 
of reserve products, whereas lipids account for 9–14% of the dry weight. The mineral fraction

are also present, with an average β-carotene content of 1.5 mg per gram of Arthrospira , correspond -
ing to 0.25 μg of vitamin A. Considering a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A 
of about 800 μg, and taking into account a natural 20–30% decrease in β-carotene level due to dihé 
storing conditions, we can say that a daily consumption of 5 g of dihé would provide about 100% 
of RDA.
Rhodophyta
Porphyra  (Bangiophyceae) is popularly known as nori in Japan, Kim in Korea, and “Zicai” in China 
(see Figures 1.1c and 1.33). It is among the most nutritious macroalgae, with a protein content of 
25–50%, and about 75% of that is digestible. This alga is an excellent source of iodine, other trace 
minerals, and dietary fibers. Sugars are low (0.1%), and the vitamin content is very high, with sig -
nificant amounts of vitamins A, B complex, and C, but the shelf life of vitamin C can be short in 
the dried product. During processing, to produce the sheets of nori, most salt is washed away, so 
the sodium content becomes low. The characteristic taste of nori is caused by the large amounts 
of three amino acids: alanine, glutamic acid, and glycine. It also contains taurine, which controls 
blood cholesterol levels. The alga is a preferred source of the red pigment R-phycoerythrin, which 
is utilized as a fluorescent “tag” in the medical diagnostic industry.
Porphyra  has been cultivated in Japan and the Republic of Korea since the seventeenth century, 
because even at that time natural stocks were insufficient to meet demand. Today Porphyra  is one of 
the largest aquaculture industries in Japan, Korea, and China. Because of its economic importance 
and other health benefits, Porphyra  cultivation is now being expanded to other countries.
Porphyra  species are primarily intertidal, occurring mainly in temperate zones around the 
world, but also in subtropical and sub-Arctic regions, as confirmed by its history of being eaten 
by the indigenous peoples of northwest America (Alaska) and Canada, Hawaii, New Zealand, and 
parts of the British Isles. Porphyra abbottae  Krishnamurthy is a nutritionally and culturally impor -
tant species of red alga used by First Peoples of coastal British Columbia and neighboring areas, 
down to northern California. This species, along with Porphyra torta  and possibly others, is a 
highly nutritious food, still gathered in quantity today by the Coast Tsimshian, Haida, Heiltsuk, 
Kwakwaka’wakw, and other coastal peoples from wild populations in large quantities, dried, and 
processed, and served in a variety of ways: toasted as a snack, cooked with clams, salmon eggs, or 
fish in soup, or sprinkled on other foods as a condiment. Common linguistic origin of the majority 
of names for this species among some 16 language groups in five language families indicates wide -
spread exchange of knowledge about this seaweed from southern Vancouver Island north to Alaska. 
The harvesting and preparation of this seaweed is exacting and time-intensive. It necessitates a wide 
range of knowledge and skills, including an understanding of weather patterns, tides, and currents; 
an appreciation of the growth and usable life stages of the seaweed; and knowledge of the optimum 
drying locations and techniques and of the procedures for secondary moistening, chopping, and 
drying to achieve the best flavors and greatest nutritional value. P. abbottiae  is generally harvested 
in May. Though formerly a women’s activity, as for dihé harvesting by Kanembu women, both 
genders now participate in seaweed gathering. The postharvest preparation and handling of the sea -
weed are fairly labor-intensive and detailed. Once processed, seaweed is considered “an expensive 
and prestigious food” and is valued as a gift or trade item that is often exchanged for equally valu -
able products from other groups, especially on the central and northern coasts of British Columbia 
and Alaska. P. abbottiae  is valued also for its medicinal properties as a gastrointestinal aid, taken 
either as a decoction or applied as a poultice for any kind of sickness in the stomach, and also as an 
orthopedic aid applied on broken collar bones.
Nearly 133 species of Porphyra  have been reported from all over the world, which includes 28 
species from Japan, 30 from North Atlantic coasts of Europe and America, and 27 species from the 
Pacific coast of Canada and United States. Seven species have been reported from the Indian coast, 
but they are not exploited commercially.272 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCPorphyra  grows as a very thin, flat, blade, which can be yellow, olive, pink, or purple. It can be 
either round, round to ovate, obovate, linear or linear lanceolate, from 5 to 35 cm in length. The thalli 
are either one or two cells thick, and each cell has one or two stellate chloroplasts with a pyrenoid. 
Porphyra  has a heteromorphic life cycle with an alternation between an aploid gametophyte consist -
ing of a macroscopic foliose thallus, which is eaten, and a filamentous diploid sporophyte called con -
chocelis phase (see Figure 1.33). This diploid conchocelis phase in the life cycle was earlier thought 
to be Conchocelis rosea , a shell-boring independent organism. Understanding that these two phases 
were connected was a major research advance made in 1949 in Britain, when the British phycolo -
gist Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker demonstrated in culture that P. umbilicalis  (L.) Kütz had a diploid 
conchocelis phase. Until this landmark work, cultivation of Porphyra  was developed intuitively, by 
observing the seasonal appearance of spores, but nobody knew where the spores came from, so there 
was little control over the whole cultivation process. Drew’s findings completely revolutionized and 
transformed the Porphyra  industry in Japan and subsequently throughout Asia, allowing indoor mass 
cultivation of the filamentous form in sterilized oyster shells and the seeding of conchospores directly 
onto nets for out-planting in the sea. All Japanese species of Porphyra  investigated so far produce 
the conchocelis phase, which can be maintained for long periods of time in free culture. It grows 
vegetatively under a wide range of temperature, irradiances, and photoperiods, and it is probably a 
perennial persistent stage in the life history on many species in nature as well.
Since Drew’s time, cultivation has flourished, and now accounts for virtually all the production 
in China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Processing of wet Porphyra  into dried sheets of nori 
has become highly mechanized, by an adaptation of the paper-making process. Wet Porphyra  is 
rinsed, chopped into small pieces, and stirred in a slurry. It is then poured onto mats or frames, 
draining away most of the water, and the mats are run through a dryer. The sheets are peeled 
from the mats and packed in bundles of 10 for sale. This product is called hoshi-nori , which dis -
tinguishes it from yaki-nori , which is toasted. Nori is mainly used as a luxurious food. It is often 
wrapped around the rice ball of sushi, a typical Japanese food consisting of a small handful of 
boiled rice with a slice of raw fish on the top. It can be incorporated into soy sauce and boiled down 
to give an appetizing luxury sauce. It is also used as a raw material for jam and wine. In China, it 
is mostly used in soups and for seasoning fried foods. In the Republic of Korea, it has similar uses 
as that in Japan.
Dried nori is in constant oversupply in Japan and producers and dealers are trying to encourage 
its use in the USA and in other countries. Production and markets in China are expanding, although 
the quality of the product is not always as good as that from the Republic of Korea and Japan.
The fronds of the red alga Palmaria  (Rodimenia ) palmata  (Florideophyceae) are known as dulce  
(see Figure 1.21); they are eaten raw as a vegetable substitute or dried and eaten as a condiment 
in North America and Europe (Brittany, Ireland and Iceland). Alaska natives consume the fronds 
fresh or singed on a hot stove, or add the air-dried fronds to soups and fish head stews. Palmaria  
is found in the eulittoral zone and sometimes the upper sublittoral. It is collected by hand by har -
vesters plucking it from the rocks at low tide. It is perennial and when either plucked or cut, new 
growth appears from the edge of the previous season’s leaf. It is harvested mainly in Ireland and in 
the shores of the Bay of Fundy in eastern Canada, and is especially abundant around Grand Manan 
Island, situated in the Bay of Fundy, in a line with the Canadian–United States of America border 
between New Brunswick and Maine. The harvest season here is from mid-May to mid-October. 
After picking, fronds are laid out to sun-dry for 6–8 h; if the weather is not suitable, it can be stored 
in seawater for a few days, but it would soon deteriorate. Whole dulse is packed for sale in plastic 
bags, at 50 g per bag. Inferior dulse, usually because of poor drying, is broken into flakes or ground 
into powder for use as a seasoning. In Ireland, it is sold in packages and looks like dark-red bundles 
of flat leaves. It is eaten raw in Ireland, like chewing tobacco, or is cooked with potatoes, in soups, 
and in fish dishes.
Dulse is a good source of minerals, being very high in iron and containing all the trace elements 
needed in human nutrition, and also has a high vitamin content. In Canada, one company has 273 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCcultivated it in land-based systems (tanks) and promotes it as a sea vegetable with the trade name 
“Sea Parsley.” It is a variant of normal dulse plants, but with small frilly outgrowths different from 
the normally flat plant. It was found by staff at the National Research Council of Canada’s laborato -
ries in Halifax, Nova Scotia, among samples from a commercial dulse harvester.
Chondrus crispus  (Florideophyceae), the Irish moss , carrageenan moss , or pioca , has a long 
history of use in foods in Ireland and in some parts of Europe (Figure 7.2). It is not eaten as such, 
but used for its thickening quality when boiled in water, because of its carrageenan content. One 
such example is its use in making “blancmange,” a traditional vanilla-flavored pudding. In east -
ern Canada, the Acadian Seaplants company is cultivating a strain of C. crispus  and marketing 
it in Japan as hana nori  (flower seaweed), a yellow macroalga that resembles the more traditional 
Japanese nori that is in limited supply from natural resources because of overharvesting and pol -
lution. First introduced to the Japanese market in 1996, the dried product, to be reconstituted by 
the user, was reported to be selling well at the end of 1999, with forecasts of a market valued at 
tens of millions of US dollars. It is used in macroalgae salads, sushimi garnishings, and as a soup 
ingredient.
Fresh Gracilaria  (Florideophyceae) has been collected and sold as a salad vegetable in Hawaii 
(USA) for several decades. It is known as ogo, ogonori , or sea moss . The mixture of ethnic groups in 
Hawaii (Hawaiians, Filipinos, Koreans, Japanese, Chinese) creates an unusual demand and supply 
has at times been limited by the stocks available from natural sources. Now, it is being successfully 
cultivated in Hawaii using an aerated tank system, producing up to 6 tons of fresh stock per week. 
Both limu manauea  and limu ogo  are sold as fresh vegetables, the latter usually mixed with raw 
fish. In Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam, species of Gracilaria  are collected by 
coastal people for food. In southern Thailand, an education programme was undertaken to show 
people how it could be used to make jellies by boiling and making use of the extracted agar. In 
the West Indies, Gracilaria  is sold in markets as sea moss ; it is believed to possess aphrodisiac 
properties and is also used as a base for a nonalcoholic drink. Gracilaria  sp. contain (wet weight 
basis): 6.9  ± 0.1% total protein, 24.7 ± 0.7% crude fiber, 3.3 ± 0.2% total lipid, and 22.7 ± 0.6% ash. 
It contains 28.5 ± 0.1 mg of vitamin C per 100 g of wet biomass, 5.2 ± 0.4% mg of β-carotene per 
100 g of dry weight, which correspond to a vitamin A activity of 865 μg. According to the standard 
FIGURE 7.2  Frond of Chondrus crispus .274 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCclassification adopted by AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists), this can be consid -
ered a very high value of vitamin A activity for a food item, which makes Gracilaria  a potential 
source of β-carotene for human consumption.
In Chile, the demand for edible macroalgae has increased, and Gracilaria chilensis  and 
Callophyllis variegata  (carola ) (Florideophyceae) (Figure 7.3) are among the most popular. G. chil -
ensis  farming is profitable, which has stimulated the research activity in recent years. Several plant -
ing techniques have been developed to fasten Gracilaria  to the substratum, which are commonly 
used by commercial farms in Chile. As C. variegata , this red macroalga has a promising future due 
to its high commercial value. However, knowledge of its biology is limited, and research projects 
have been funded for the management of the natural resources and opportunities for cultivation. 
Carpospores are available during winter, whereas tetraspores are available during spring. Natural 
populations of C. variegata  are also being studied to develop management recommendations. From 
this perspective, it has been demonstrated that the holdfast of this species has a high regeneration 
capacity, which enables the harvested population to recover.
Ochrophyta (Phaeophyceae)
Alaria esculenta  is a large brown kelp that grows in the upper limit of the sublittoral zone (Figure 
7.4). It is known as winged kelp. It has a wide distribution in cold waters and does not survive 
above 16°C. Presumably due to this factor, and rising sea temperatures, this genus has largely 
disappeared from the English Channel in the past 100 years. It is found in areas such as coasts 
of the North Atlantic (France, Scotland, Ireland, Greenland, Iceland, northeastern United States, 
northeastern Canada), the North Sea (England, Norway, Netherlands), the Arctic Sea (Novaya 
Zemlya), and the North Pacific (Sakhalin and northern Hokkaido). A. esculenta  is a colonizing 
species and can form the main canopy in the exposed rocky areas where it grows. Although it 
is typically not found at a depth more than 8–10 m, it has been recorded at depths over 20 m. Its 
highest seasonal growth rate can reach 20–25 cm per month. As all kelps, Alaria  too demonstrate 
a heteromorphic, sporic life history, with a macroscopic, dominant sporophyte, and a microscopic 
gametophyte. The sporophyte comprises of a ramified holdfast, an unbranched stipe, and a blade 
with a percurrent, cartilaginous midrib. Unique to the genus Alaria  is that the sori of the unilocu -
lar sporangia are restricted to certain blades, the sporophylls. Most species, such as A. esculenta , 
are perennial that can live up to 7 years in some locations; after reproduction, the blade sloughs 
off, leaving the stipe and meristem. The persisting meristem produces a new blade at the begin -
ning of the next growing season.
FIGURE 7.3  Frond of Callophyllis variegata .275 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCBeing consumed in Ireland, Scotland (United Kingdom), and Iceland, either fresh or cooked, it is 
said to have the best protein among the kelps and is also rich in trace metals and vitamins, especially 
niacin. It is usually collected from the wild and eaten by local people, and although it has been suc -
cessfully cultivated, this has not been extended to a commercial scale.
China is the largest producer of edible macroalgae, harvesting about 12 million wet tons annu -
ally. The greater part of this is for haidai , produced from hundreds of hectares of the brown mac -
roalga Laminaria japonica  (Figure 7.5). It is a large macroalga, usually 2–5-m long, but it can 
grow up to 10 m in favorable conditions. It requires water temperatures below 20°C. Laminaria  
was originally native to Japan and the Republic of Korea where it is being cultivated since 1730. It 
was introduced accidentally to China in 1927 probably by the importation of logs from Hokkaido 
FIGURE 7.4  Frond of Alaria  esculenta .
FIGURE 7.5  Frond of Laminaria japonica .276 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCin Japan. Prior to that, China had imported its needs from the naturally growing resources in Japan 
and the Republic of Korea. In the 1950s, China developed a method for cultivating Laminaria ; 
sporelings (seedlings) are grown in cooled water in greenhouses and later planted out in long ropes 
suspended in the ocean. This activity became a widespread source of income for large numbers of 
coastal families and made China self-sufficient in Laminaria  leading also to a strong export market. 
Currently, the yield of kelp from 200,000 acres of farms is about 250,000 dry tons (equivalent to 
2,000,000 wet tons) worth about 2 billion Yuan (~326 million US dollars).
In Japan, people consume a dried mixture of Laminaria  species: L. longissima , L. japonica , 
L. angustata , L. coriacea , and L. ochotensis.  These algae are all harvested from natural sources, 
mainly on the northern island of Hokkaido, with about 10% coming from the northern shores of 
Honshu. The plants grow on rocks and reefs in the sublittoral zone, from 2- to 15-m deep. They 
prefer calm water at temperatures between 3°C and 20°C. The naturally growing plants are bien -
nial and are ready for harvesting after 20 months. Harvesting is from June to October, using boats. 
Hooks of various types are attached to long poles and used to twist and break the macroalgae from 
the rocky bottom. In the 1970s, forced cultivation was introduced, similar to the system developed 
in China in the early 1950s. Today, about one-third of Japan’s requirements come from cultivation, 
with the remaining two-thirds still coming from natural resources.
For cultivation, Laminaria  must go through its life cycle, involving an alternation of genera -
tions (see Figure 1.32). Seed stock is produced from meiospores released from wild or cultivated 
sporophytes, incubated in a cool, dark place for up to 24 h. The spores attach to a substratum 
within 24 h and develop into gametophytes. In 2 months, gametophytes release gametes, fertiliza -
tion occurs, and sporophytes grow about 6-mm long. Seed stock is reared on horizontal or vertical 
strings, placed in sheltered waters for about 10 days; after this period, the strings are cut into small 
pieces that are inserted into the warp of the culture rope. The ropes with the young sporophytes are 
attached to floating rafts, which can be vertical-line rafts or horizontal-line rafts. The first type con -
sists of a large-diameter rope, 60-m long, whose ends are anchored to a wooden peg driven into the 
sea bottom. Buoys fixed every 2–3 m keep the rope floating. The ropes with the young sporophytes 
attached hang down from this rope at 50-cm intervals. The second consists of three ropes laid out 
parallel, 5-m apart. The ropes with the young sporophytes are tied across two ropes so that they are 
more or less horizontal, and each of them has equal access to light.
In China, the largest region for Laminaria  cultivation is in the Yellow Sea, where yields are 
increased by spray application of nitrogen fertilizer directly on the floating raft areas. In Japan, the 
cultivation is mainly in the waters between Honshu and Hokkaido islands, rich in nitrogen fertil -
izers. Harvesting takes place in the summer, from mid-June to early July, when the fronds are laid 
out in the sun to dry and then packed.
Laminaria  species contain about 10% protein, 2% fat, and useful amounts of minerals and vita -
mins, though generally lower than those found in nori. For example, it has one-tenth the amounts 
of vitamins but three times the amount of iron compared with nori. Brown macroalgae also contain 
iodine, which is lacking in nori and other red macroalgae. In China, haidai  is regarded as a health 
vegetable because of its mineral and vitamin content, especially in the north, where green vegeta -
bles are scarce in winter. It is usually cooked in soups with other ingredients. In Japan, it is used in 
everyday food, such as a seasoned and cooked kombu  that is served with herring or sliced salmon.
Another exploited kelp is Undaria  sp., which together with Laminaria  sp. is one of the two most 
economically important edible algae. This alga has been a food item of high value and importance in 
Japan since 700 AD. Cultivation began in Japan at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the 
demand exceeded the wild stock harvest, and was later followed in China. The Republic of Korea 
began the cultivation around the 1970s and today it is the largest producer of wakame /quandai-cai  
from U. pinnatifida , the main species cultivated (Figure 7.6). U. pinnatifida  grows on rocky shores 
and bays in the sublittoral zone, down to about 7 m, indigenous to the northwest Pacific Ocean 
and the cold temperate coastal regions of Japan, China, Korea, and southeast Russia. It grows best 
between 5°C and 15°C, and stops growing if the water temperature rises above 25°C. U. pinnatifida  277 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLChas been spread around the world by international shipping and mariculture and has extended its 
range to include four continents since the 1980s. It is now growing in the temperate Pacific Ocean 
(Australia and New Zealand), the southeastern temperate Indian ocean, the Mediterranean (France, 
Spain, Italy), and the temperate north and south Atlantic Ocean (United States, Mexico, Argentina, 
Great Britain, Belgium, and France).
Undaria  is an annual plant with a life cycle similar to Laminaria . It has an alternation of gen -
erations with a large sporophyte and a microscopic gametophyte, and its cultivation method is 
similar to that of Laminaria . The ropes are immersed in seawater tanks containing fertile sporo -
phytes in April–May, when the water temperature is 17–20°C, to let spores attaching to them. The 
ropes are then lashed to frames submerged in seawater tanks until September–November. When 
the young plants are 1–2 cm long, and the temperature falls below 15°C, the ropes are removed 
from the frames and wound around a rope that is suspended by floats and anchored to the bottom 
at each end. Harvesting begins by thinning out the plants by cutting them off at a point close to 
the rope. The remaining plants on the rope have plenty of space and continue to grow. Harvesting 
finishes in April.
After its accidental introduction, cultivation of Undaria  has been undertaken also in France, 
where a new technique has been developed and applied. Once the spores have been collected in 
spring, they are cultivated in laboratories using techniques close to those used for the microal -
gae. Through precisely controlled light and temperature, the reproducing elements (gametes) are 
blocked, to the benefit of the cells that give them life (gametophytes). One month before out-plant -
ing, the gametophytes are brought to maturation. After fertilization, the solution with the suspended 
zygotes is sprayed onto a nylon line that is wound around a frame. The zygotes germinate, young 
sporophytes begin to grow on the frames, and are eventually out-planted on floating ropes in the 
usual way. It is then possible to produce large quantities of reproducing cells which can then be 
brought to maturity—any time of the year—to form gametes.
Undaria  is processed into a variety of food products. After harvesting, the algae are washed 
(with seawater and then freshwater), the central midrib is removed, and the pieces are dried; this is 
suboshi wakame . To avoid fading of the color, the fresh fronds are mixed with ash from wood or 
straw, so that the alkalinity of the ash inactivates the enzymes responsible of the fading. After 2–3 
days in the dark, the algae are washed to remove salt and ash (with seawater and then freshwater), 
the midrib is removed, and the pieces are dried. This is haiboshi wakame , which keeps its deep 
green color for a long time and retains the elasticity of the fresh fronds.
FIGURE 7.6  Frond of Undaria pinnatifida .278 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThe major wakame  product is salted wakame . Fresh fronds are heated into water at 80°C for 
1 min, quickly cooled, dehydrated by 24-h incubation with salt (30% w/w), and then stored at −10°C. 
When ready for packaging, the midribs are removed, and the pieces placed in plastic bags for sale. It 
is a fresh green color and can be preserved for long periods when stored at low temperatures.
The crude protein content of wakame  and kombu  is 16.3 g% and 6.2 g%, respectively, and both 
algae contain all essential amino acids, which account for 47.1% of the total amino acid content in 
wakame  and for 50.7% in kombu . Wakame  and kombu  have high contents of β-carotene, that is, 1.30 
and 2.99 mg/100 g d.w. or 217 and 481 μg retinol/100 g d.w., respectively. The basic component in sea 
vegetables is iodine, an essential trace element, and an integral part of two hormones released by the 
thyroid gland. Wakame  and kombu  contain 26 and 170 mg/100 g d.w. of iodine, respectively. The rec -
ommended daily dose for adults is 150 μg, meaning that the consumption of 557 mg of wakame  and 
88 mg of kombu  would satisfy the daily requirement for iodine. The toxic dose of iodine for adults is 
thought to be over 2000 μg per day. The intake of recommended amount of wakame  and kombu  per 
day would supply 0.94 and 6.29 mg of iodine, respectively, meaning that 1.18 g of kombu  a day would 
not exceed the recommended safe dose of iodine. However, it is claimed that iodine supplements can 
be toxic only if taken in excess, while eating sea vegetables should cause no concern.
Hizikia fusiforme  is another brown algae popular as food in Japan and the Republic of Korea 
known as hiziki  (Figure 7.7). It grows at the bottom of the eulittoral and top of the sublittoral zones, 
on the southern shore of Hokkaido, all around Honshu, on the Korean peninsula, and most coasts 
of the China Sea. Up to 20,000 wet tons were harvested from natural beds in the Republic of Korea 
in 1984, when cultivation began. Since then, cultivation has steadily increased, on the southwest 
coast. This medium-dark brown macroalga grows to about 20–30 cm in length; the many-branched 
long central stipes give an appearance slightly reminiscent of conifer leaves, with a finer frond 
structure than wakame  and kombu . The protein, fat, carbohydrate, and vitamin contents are similar 
to those found in kombu , although most of the vitamins are destroyed in the processing of the raw 
macroalgae. The iron, copper, and manganese contents are relatively high, certainly higher than in 
kombu . Like most brown macroalgae, its fat content is low (1.5%) but 20–25% of the fatty acid is 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).
FIGURE 7.7  Frond of Hizikia fusiforme.279 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCCultivation process is very similar to that of Undaria  and Laminaria . Young fronds collected 
from natural beds are inserted in a rope at 10-cm intervals. Seeding ropes are attached to the main 
cultivation rope, kept at a depth of 2–3 m using flotation buoys along the rope anchored to the sea -
bed at each end. Cultivation is from November to May, and harvesting is in May–June.
The harvested fronds are washed with seawater, dried in the sun, and boiled with the addition of 
other brown macroalgae such as Eisenia bicyclis  or Ecklonia cava  (Figure 7.8), which helps remov -
ing phlorotannin, which gives Hizikia  its astringent bitter taste. The resulting product is cut into 
short pieces, sun-dried, and sold packaged as hoshi hiziki.  Typically, it is cooked in stir fries, with 
fried bean curd and vegetables such as carrot or it may be simmered with other vegetables.
Japan also produces Cladosiphon okamuranus  cultivated around Okinawa Island. This brown 
macroalga is also harvested from natural populations around the southern islands of Japan and 
consumed as mozuku . It is characterized by a thallus with a stringy not turgid fronds and it can 
exceed 50 cm in length. Cladosiphon  grows in the sublittoral zone, mainly at depths of 1–3 m. As 
Undaria  and Laminaria , its life history involves an alternation of generations. Spores collected 
from the sporophytes are stored during the summer and used for seeding nets in fall. When young 
sporophytes have grown to 2–5 cm, the nets are moved to the main cultivation sites. The fronds are 
harvested after about 90 days, when they have grown to 50 cm. Harvesting is done by divers using a 
suction pump that draws the macroalgae up and into a floating basket beside the attending boat. The 
harvested macroalgae are washed, salted with 20–25% salt, and let to dehydrate for about 15 days. 
Drained fronds are sold in wet, salted form in packages.
Chlorophyta
Monostroma  (Ulvophyceae) (Figure 7.9) and Enteromorpha  (Ulvophyceae) (Figure 7.10) are two 
green macroalgae cultivated in Japan, and known as aonori  or green laver .
Monostroma latissimum  occurs naturally in the bays and gulfs of southern areas of Japan, usu -
ally in the upper eulittoral zone. The fronds are bright green in color, flat, and leafy consisting of a 
single cell layer. They are slender at the holdfast and growing wider toward the apex, often with a 
slight funnel shape that has splits down the side. Monostroma  reproduces seasonally, usually during 
FIGURE 7.8  Frond of Ecklonia cava .280 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCtropical dry season or temperate spring. It is found in shallow seawater usually less than 1 m in 
depth; generally grows on rocks, coral, mollusk shells, or other hard substrates, but also grows as 
an epiphyte on sea plants including crops such as Kappaphycus  and Eucheuma . It averages 20% 
protein and has a useful vitamin and mineral content. It has a life cycle involving an alternation of 
generations, one generation being the familiar leafy plant, and the other microscopic and approxi -
mately spherical. It is this latter generation that releases spores that germinate into the leafy frond. 
For cultivation, these spores are collected on rope nets by submerging the nets in areas where 
FIGURE 7.9  Frond of Monostroma latissimum .
FIGURE 7.10  Frond of Enteromorpha  sp.281 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC natural Monostroma  populations grow. The seeded nets are then placed in the bay or estuary, fixed 
to poles so that they are under water at high tide and exposed for about 4 h at low tide, or using float -
ing rafts in deeper water. The nets are harvested every 3–4 weeks and the growing season allows 
about 3–4 harvests. The harvested macroalga is washed well in seawater and freshwater. It can then 
either be processed into sheets and dried, for sale in shops, or dried, either outside or in dryers, and 
then boiled with sugar, soy sauce, and other ingredients to make “ nori-jam.”
Enteromorpha prolifera  and Enteromorpha intestinalis  are found in bays and river mouths 
around Japan, and are also found in many other parts of the world, including Europe, North America, 
and Hawaii. They can thrive in both salt and brackish waters and are usually found at the top of 
the sublittoral zone. Fronds are usually flat, narrow, and bright green, and they can be attached to 
firm substrates in clear, shallow waters, and also occur as epiphyte on cultured red seaweeds such 
as Kappaphycus , Eucheuma , Gracilaria , Gelidiella , and others. They contain about 20% protein, 
little fat, low sodium, high iron, and calcium, and vitamin B-group content generally higher than 
most vegetables. The life history involves an alternation of generations with the same appearance 
of long, tubular filaments. As for Monostroma , rope nets are seeded with spores by submerging 
them in areas where Enteromorpha  is growing naturally. Seed collection is from June to September 
depending on the country, and young plants are visible by early November. Harvesting, by hand or 
by machine, can be done 2–3 times during the growing period, and harvested fronds are washed in 
freshwater and dried in large trays.
Ulva  sp. (see Figures 1.1r and 1.31) is known as sea lettuce, since fronds may be convoluted and 
have an appearance rather like lettuce. It is naturally found in shallow seawater usually <1 m in 
depth, where it grows on rocks, coral, mollusk shells, or other hard substrates but also as an epiphyte 
on other sea macroalgae. Bright green in color, it is slender at the holdfast and grows wider toward 
the ape; it reproduces seasonally, during tropical dry season or temperate spring. It can be collected 
from the wild and added to Monostroma  and Enteromorpha  as part of aonori . It has a higher protein 
content than the other two, but much lower vitamin content, except for niacin, which is double that 
of Enteromorpha.
Caulerpa lentillifera  (Figure 7.11) and C. racemosa  (Figure 1.20) are two edible green algae used 
in fresh salads and known as sea grapes or green caviar because of their appearance, such bunches 
of green grapes. These algae often produce “runners” under the substrate, which can produce sev -
eral vertical branches extending above the substrate. They naturally grow on sandy or muddy bot -
tom in shallow protected waters. C. lentillifera  has been very successfully cultivated in enclosures 
similar to prawn ponds in the central Philippines, with water temperature ranging between 25°C 
and 30°C. Pond depth should be about 0.5 m and areas of about 0.5 ha are usual. Also some strains 
of C. racemosa  give good yields under pond cultivation conditions.

plants are washed thoroughly in seawater to remove all sand and mud, then sorted and placed in 
100–200-g packages; these will stay fresh for 7 days if chilled and kept moist.

animal  Feed
Microalgae are utilized in aquaculture as live feeds for all growth stages of bivalve molluscs 
(e.g., oysters, scallops, clams, and mussels), for the larval/early juvenile stages of abalone, crus -
taceans, and some fish species, and for zooplankton used in aquaculture food chains. Over the 
last four decades, several hundred microalgae species have been tested as food, but probably <20 
have gained widespread use in aquaculture. Microalgae must possess a number of key attributes 
to be useful aquaculture species. They must be of an appropriate size for ingestion, for example, 
from 1 to 15 μm for filter feeders and 10–100 μm for grazers and readily digested. They must 
have rapid growth rates, be amenable to mass culture, and also be stable in culture to any fluctua -
tions in temperature, light, and nutrients as may occur in hatchery systems. Finally, they must TABLE 7.1

the food chain.
Successful strains for bivalve culture included Isochrysis galbana  (Haptophyta, Coccolitophy -
ceae), Isochrysis  sp. (T.ISO) (Haptophyta, Coccolitophyceae), Pavlova lutheri  (Haptophyta, Pav -
lovophyceae) (see Figure 1.1ag), Tetraselmis suecica  (Chlorophyta, Chlorodendrophyceae) (see 
Figure 1.1p), Pseudoisochrysis paradoxa  (Haptophyta, Coccolitophyceae), Chaetoceros calcitrans  
(Ochrophyta, Bacillariophyceae), and Skeletonema costatum  (Ochrophyta, Bacillariophyceae).
Isochrysis  sp. (T.ISO), P. lutheri , and C. calcitrans  are the most common species used to feed 
the larval, early juvenile, and broodstock (during hatchery conditioning) stages of bivalve molluscs; 
these are usually fed together as a mixed diet. Many of the strains successfully used for bivalves are 
also used as direct feed for crustaceans (especially shrimp) during the early larval stages, especially 
diatoms such as Skeletonema  spp. and Chaetoceros  spp. Benthic diatoms such as Navicula  spp. and 
Nitzschia  are commonly mass-cultured and then settled onto plates as a diet for grazing juvenile 
abalone. Isochrysis  sp. (T.ISO), P. lutheri , T. suecica , or Nannochloropsis  spp. (see Figure 1.1am) 
are commonly fed to the brine shrip Artemia  or rotifers, which are then fed on to later larval stages 
of crustacean and fish larvae.
Microalgal species can vary significantly in their nutritional value, and this may also change under 
different culture conditions. Nevertheless, a carefully selected mixture of microalgae can offer an 
excellent nutritional package for larval animals, either directly or indirectly (through enrichment of 
zooplankton). Microalgae that have been found to possess good nutritional properties—either as mono -
species or within a mixed diet—include C. calcitrans , C. muelleri , P. lutheri , Isochrysis  sp. (T.ISO), 
T. suecica , S. costatum , and Thalassiosira pseudonana  (Ochrophyta, Bacillariophyceae). Several fac -
tors can contribute to the nutritional value of a microalga, including its size and shape, digestibility 
(related to cell-wall structure and composition), biochemical composition (e.g., nutrients, enzymes, 
toxins if present), and the requirements of the animal feeding on the alga. Since the early reports that 
demonstrated biochemical differences in gross composition between microalgae and fatty acids, many 
studies have attempted to correlate the nutritional value of microalgae with their biochemical profile. 
However, results from feeding experiments that have tested microalgae differing in a specific nutri -
ent are often difficult to interpret because of the confounding effects of other microalgal nutrients. 
Nevertheless, from examining all the literature data, including experiments where algal diets have 
been supplemented with compounded diets or emulsions, some general conclusions can be reached.
Microalgae grown to late-logarithmic growth phase typically contain 30–40% protein, 10–20% 
lipid, and 5–15% carbohydrate. When cultured through to the stationary phase, the proximate com -
position of microalgae can change significantly; for example, when nitrate is limiting, carbohydrate 
levels can double at the expense of protein. There does not appear to be a strong correlation between 
the proximate composition of microalgae and nutritional value, though algal diets with high levels 
of carbohydrate are reported to produce the best growth for juvenile oysters ( Ostrea edulis ) and 
larval scallops ( Patinopecten yessoensis ) provided polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are also 
present in adequate proportions. In contrast, high dietary protein provided best growth for juvenile 
mussels ( Mytilus trossulus ) and Pacific oysters ( Crassostrea gigas ). PUFAs derived from microal -
gae, that is, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), EPA, and arachidonic acid (AA) are known to be essen -
tial for various larvae.
The fatty acid content showed systematic differences according to the taxonomic group, although 
there were examples of significant differences between microalgae from the same class. Most 
microalgal species have moderate to high percentages of EPA (7–34%). Haptophytes (e.g., Pavlova  
spp. and Isochrysis  sp. (T.ISO)) and cryptomonads are relatively rich in DHA (0.2–11%), whereas 
eustigmatophytes ( Nannochloropsis  spp.) and diatoms have the highest percentages of AA (0–4%). 
Chlorophytes ( Dunaliella  spp. and Chlorella  spp.) are deficient in both C20 and C22 PUFAs, 
although some species have small amounts of EPA (up to 3.2%). Because of this PUFA deficiency, 
chlorophytes generally have low nutritional value and are not suitable as a single species  diet. 284 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCChlorodendrophyceae as Tetraselmis  spp. and Mamiellophyceae as Micromonas  spp. contain sig -
nificant proportions of C20 or C22, respectively. In the late-logarithmic phase, prymnesiophytes, 
on average, contain the highest percentages of saturated fats (33% of total fatty acids), followed by 
diatoms and eustigmatophytes (27%), prasinophytes, and chlorophytes (23%) and cryptomonads 
(18%). The content of saturated fats in microalgae can also be improved by culturing under high 
light conditions.
The content of vitamins can vary between microalgae. Ascorbic acid shows the greatest variation, 
that is, 16-fold (1–16 mg g−1 dry weight). Concentrations of other vitamins typically show a two- to 
four-fold difference between species, that is, β-carotene, 0.5–1.1 mg g−1; niacin, 0.11–0.47 mg g−1; 
α-tocopherol, 0.07–0.29  mg g−1; thiamin, 29–109 μg g−1; riboflavin, 25–50 μg g−1; pantothenic acid, 
14–38  μg g−1; folates, 17–24 μg g−1; pyridoxine, 3.6–17 μg g−1; cobalamin, 1.8–7.4 μg g−1; biotin, 
1.1–1.9  μg g−1; retinol, ≤2.2 μg g−1; and vitamin D, <0.45 μg g−1. To put the vitamin content of the 
microalgae into context, data should be compared with the nutritional requirements of the consum -
ing animal. Unfortunately, nutritional requirements of larval or juvenile animals that feed directly 
on microalgae are, at best, poorly understood. However, the requirements of the adult are far better 
known and, in the absence of information to the contrary, will have to serve as a guide for the lar -
val animal. These data suggest that a carefully selected, mixed-algal diet should provide adequate 
concentrations of the vitamins for aquaculture food chains.
The amino acid composition of the protein of microalgae is very similar between species and 
relatively unaffected by the growth phase and light conditions. Further, the composition of essen -
tial amino acids in microalgae is very similar to that of protein from oyster larvae ( C. gigas ). This 
indicates that it is unlikely that the protein quality is a factor contributing to the differences in nutri -
tional value of microalgal species.
Sterols, minerals, and pigments also may contribute to nutritional differences of microalgae.
A common procedure during the culture of both larval fish and prawns is to add microalgae 
(i.e., “green water”) to intensive culture systems together with the zooplankton prey. Addition of 
the microalgae to larval tanks can improve the production of larvae, though the exact mechanism 
of action is unclear. Theories advanced include (a) light attenuation (i.e., shading effects), which 
have a beneficial effect on larvae, (b) maintenance of the nutritional quality of the zooplankton, (c) 
an excretion of vitamins or other growth-promoting substances by algae, and (d) a probiotic effect 
of the algae. Most likely, the mechanism may be a combination of several of these possibilities. 
Maintenance of NH3 and O2 balance has also been proposed, though this has not been supported 
by experimental evidence. The most popular algae species used for green water applications 
are N. oculata  and T. suecica . More research is needed on the application of other microalgae, 
especially those species rich in DHA, to green water systems. Green water may also be applied 
to extensive outdoor production systems by fertilizing ponds to stimulate microalgal growth, and 
correspondingly, zooplankton production, as food for larvae introduced into the ponds.
For a long time, animals such as sheep, cattle, and horses that lived in coastal areas have eaten 
macroalgae, especially in those European countries where large brown macroalgae were washed 
ashore. Today, the availability of macroalgae for animals has been increased with the produc -
tion of macroalgae meal: dried macroalgae that has been milled to a fine powder. In the early 
1960s, Norway was among the early producers of macroalgae meal, using Ascophyllum nodosum  
(Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae) (see Figure 1.1aq), a macroalga that grows in the eulittoral zone so that 
it can be cut and collected when exposed at low tide. France has used Laminaria digitata , Iceland 
both Ascophyllum  and Laminaria  species, and the United Kingdom, Ascophyllum .
Because Ascophyllum  is so accessible, it is the main raw material for macroalgae meal, and most 
experimental work to measure the effectiveness of macroalgae meal has been done on this mac -
roalgae. The macroalgae used for meal must be freshly cut, as drift macroalgae is low in minerals 
and usually becomes infected with mold. The wet macroalgae is passed through hammer mills with 
progressively smaller screens to reduce it to fine particles. These are passed through a drum dryer 285 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCstarting at 700–800°C and exiting at no more than 70°C. It should have a moisture level of about 
15%. It is milled and stored in sealed bags because it picks up moisture if exposed to air. It can be 
stored for about a year. Analysis shows that it contains useful amounts of minerals (potassium, 
phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, sodium, chlorine, and sulfur), trace elements, and vitamins. 
Trace elements are essential elements needed by humans and other mammals in smaller quantities 
than iron (approximately 50 mg/kg body weight), and include zinc, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, 
nickel, tin, vanadium, fluorine, and iodine. Because most of the carbohydrates and proteins are not 
digestible, the nutritional value of macroalgae has traditionally been assumed to be in its contribu -
tion of minerals, trace elements, and vitamins to the diet of animals. In Norway, it has been assessed 
as having only 30% of the feeding value of grains.
Ascophyllum  is a very dark macroalga due to a high content of phenolic compounds. It is likely 
that the protein is bound to the phenols, giving insoluble compounds that are not attacked by bacte -
ria in the stomach or enzymes in the intestine. Alaria esculenta  is another large brown macroalgae, 
but much lighter in color and in some experimental trials it has been found to be more effective than 
Ascophyllum  meal. It is this lack of protein digestibility that is a distinct drawback to Ascophyllum  
meal providing useful energy content. In preparing compound feedstuffs, farmers may be less con -
cerned about the price per kilogram of an additive; the decisive factor is more likely to be the digest -
ibility and nutritive value of the additive.
In feeding trials with poultry, adding Ascophyllum  meal had no benefit except to increase the 
iodine content of the eggs. With pigs, addition of 3% Ascophyllum  meal had no effect on the meat 
yield. However, there have been some positive results reported with cattle and sheep. An experi -
ment for 7 years with dairy cows (seven pairs of identical twins) showed an average increase in milk 
production of 6.8% that lead to 13% more income. A trial involving two groups each of 900 ewes 
showed that those fed macroalgae meal over a 2-year period maintained their weight much better 
during winter feeding and also gave greater wool production.
The results of trials reported above and in the suggested reading below leave the impression 
that macroalgae meal is probably only really beneficial to sheep and cattle. Certainly, the size of 
the industry has diminished since the late 1960s and early 1970s, when Norway alone was produc -
ing about 15,000 tons of macroalgae meal annually. Australia, Canada, Ireland, Norway, United 
Kingdom, and United States of America use macroalgae meal as a feed additive for sheep, cattle, 
horses, poultry, goats, dogs, cats, emus, and alpacas. In fish farming, wet feed usually consists of 
meat waste and fish waste mixed with dry additives containing extra nutrients, all formed together 
in a doughy mass. When thrown into the fish ponds or cages, it must hold together and not disinte -
grate or dissolve in the water. A binder is needed; sometimes a technical grade of alginate is used. 
It has also been used to bind formulated feeds for shrimp and abalone. However, still cheaper is the 
use of finely ground macroalgae meal made from brown macroalgae; the alginate in the macroalgae 
acts as the binder. The binder may be a significant proportion of the price of the feed, so macroalgae 
meal is a much better choice. However, since the trend is to move to dry feed rather than wet, this 
market is not expected to expand.
There is also a market for fresh macroalgae as a feed for abalone. In Australia, the brown mac -
roalgae Macrocystis pyrifera  (Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae) (Figure 7.12) and the red macroalgae 
Gracilaria edulis  (Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae) have been used. In South Africa, Porphyra  
(Rhodophyta, Bangiophyceae) is in demand for abalone feed, and recommendations have been 
made for the management of the wild population of the macroalgae. Pacific dulse  (Palmaria mollis , 
Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae) has been found to be a valuable food for the red abalone, Haliotis 
rufescens , and development of land-based cultivation has been undertaken with a view to produc -
ing commercial quantities of the macroalgae. The green macroalgae, Ulva lactuca  (Chlorophyta, 
Ulvophyceae), has been fed to Haliotis tuberculata  and H. discus . Feeding trials showed that aba -
lone growth is greatly improved by high protein content and this is attained by culturing the mac -
roalgae with high levels of ammonia present.286 Algae

The principal commercial seaweed extracts continue to be the three hydrocolloids: agar, alginates 
(derivative of alginic acid), and carrageenans, which are extracted from various red and brown mac -
roalgae. A hydrocolloid is a noncrystalline substance with very large molecules, which dissolves 
in water to give a thickened (viscous) solution. The processed food industry is still the primary 
market for the seaweed hydrocolloids where they serve as texturing agents and stabilizers of certain 
products, such as ice-cream (they inhibit the formation of large ice crystals, allowing the ice-cream 
to retain a smooth texture); agar and its derivative products agarose and bacteriological agar have 
long enjoyed attractive markets such as microbiological and electrophoresis media, respectively. 
Alginates continue to be used in textile printing, paper coating, and other relatively low-margin 
industrial applications, but their use in restructured meat products for pet and human foods offer 
better profit margins. Interest is growing in the use of alginate beads for controlled drug release 
and this could develop into a profitable niche market. Carrageenan has long enjoyed a small share 
of the personal care toothpaste binder market and has started to make inroads into cosmetics and 
pharmaceuticals, for example, drug capsules and excipient formulations.
The use of macroalgae as a source of these hydrocolloids dates back to 1658, when the gell -
ing properties of agar, extracted with hot water from a red macroalgae, were first discovered in 
Japan. Extracts of Irish moss ( Chondrus crispus ; Figure 7.2), another red macroalgae, contain 
carrageenan and were popular as thickening agents in the nineteenth century. It was not until the 
1930s that extracts of brown macroalgae, containing alginate, were produced commercially and 
sold as thickening and gelling agents. Industrial uses of macroalgae extracts expanded rapidly 
after the Second World War, but were sometimes limited by the availability of raw materials. 
Once again, research into life cycles has led to the development of cultivation industries that now 
supply a high proportion of the raw materials for some hydrocolloids. Today, approximately 1 
million tons of wet macroalgae are harvested annually and extracted to produce the above three 
hydrocolloids. In 2009, total hydrocolloid sales volume was about 87,000 tons, for a value of more 
than 1000 million US dollars.

gums but none have the exact gelling and viscosity properties of macroalgae gums and it is very 
unlikely that macroalgae will be replaced as the source of these polysaccharides in the near future.
Agar
Agar, a general name for polysaccharides extracted from some red algae, is built up of alternating 
d- and l-galactopyranose units. The name agar is derived from a Malaysian word agar-agar , which 
literally means “macroalgae.” As the gelling agent kanten , it is known from Japan since the 17th 
century; extracts from red macroalgae were carried up the mountains to freeze overnight so that 
water and other impurities could be extracted from the material. Agar finds its widest use as a solid 
microbiological culture substrate. Modern agar is a purified form consisting largely of the neutral 
fraction known as agarose; the nonionic nature of the latter makes it more suitable for a range of 
laboratory applications. Agar in a crude or purified form also finds wide usage in the food industry 
where it is used in various kinds of ices, canned foods, and bakery products.
The higher-quality agar (bacteriological-grade agar) is extracted from species of the red algal 
genera Pterocladia  (Florideophyceae) and Gelidium  (Florideophyceae) (Figure 7.13), which are 
harvested by hand from natural populations in Spain, France, Portugal, Morocco, the Azores, 
California, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Chile, 
and Japan. Agars of lesser quality (food-grade agar) are extracted from Gracilaria  and Hypnea  
(Florideophyceae) species. Gelidium  is a small, slow-growing alga and, while efforts to cultivate 
it in tanks and ponds have been biologically successful, they have generally proved uneconomic. 
Gracilaria  species were once considered unsuitable for agar production because the quality of the 
agar was poor. In the 1950s, it was found that pretreatment of the macroalgae with alkali before 
extraction lowered the yield but gave a good-quality agar. This allowed expansion of the agar indus -
try, which had been previously limited by the available supply of Gelidium , and led to the harvest -
ing of a variety of wild species of Gracilaria  in countries such as Argentina, Chile, Indonesia, and 
Namibia. Chilean Gracilaria  was especially useful, but evidence of over-harvesting of the wild crop 
FIGURE 7.13  Frond of Gelidium  sp.288 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCsoon emerged. Cultivation methods were then developed, both in ponds and in the open waters of 
protected bays. These methods have since spread beyond Chile to other countries, such as China, 
Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Namibia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, usually using species 
of Gracilaria  native to each particular country. Gracilaria  species can be grown in both cold and 
warm waters. Today, the supply of Gracilaria  still derives mainly from the wild, with the extent of 
cultivation depending on price fluctuations.
Strong-gelling agar is extracted directly from Gelidium  with a dilute acid solution to break down 
cell walls in a pressure cooker, whereas extracting strong-gelling agar from Gracilaria  requires 
the use of a boiling alkali solution. The alkali treatment converts the galactose 6-SO4 to 3,6-anhy -
drogalactose, well-known chemistry that “de-kinks” the polygalactose molecules and enhances the 
gelling process. These process differences explain why it is difficult to optimize the production of 
agar from both seaweeds in the same process line.
Currently, two companies have emerged as undisputed leaders within the industry: Algas Marinas 
in Chile and Agarindo Bogatama in Indonesia; between them, they are producing about 3600 tons 
year−1 or about 38% of current production. Other strong producers are Setexam in Morocco, MSC 
Co. in Korea, Hispanagar in Spain, and Huey Shyang Seaweed Industrial Company in China. These 
six companies account for about 5500 tons year−1 of production/sales or 57% of current total market. 
Some European producers have also chosen to expand production outside their home country. B & 
V from Italy has production interests in Indonesia and Morocco (although production there has been 
recently curtailed). Hispanagar, with some existing overseas operations, has started up activities in 
China as well.
Alginates
Alginates are cell-wall constituents of brown algae (Phaeophyceae). They are chain-forming hetero -
polysaccharides made up of blocks of mannuronic acid and guluronic acid. Composition of the blocks 
depends on the species being used for extraction and the part of the thallus from which extraction is 
made. Extraction procedures probably also affect alginate quality. Alginates of one kind or another 
seem to be present in most species of brown algae but they occur in exploitable quantities (30–45% 
d.w.) only in the larger kelps and wracks (Laminariales and Fucales). The more useful brown mac -
roalgae grow in cold waters, thriving best in waters up to about 20°C. Brown macroalgae are also 
found in warmer waters, but these are less suitable for alginate production and are rarely used as 
food. A wide variety of species are used, harvested in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.
Alginates of commerce are primarily the alkali or alkaline earth salts of alginic acid, the sodium 
salt being the most widely used in foods. The only other derivative of alginic acid that is used in 
the food industry is propylene glycol alginate. The ammonia and alkali metal salts of alginic acid 
readily dissolve in cold water at low concentrations to give viscous solutions. Alginates, especially 
sodium alginate, are widely used in the textile industry because they form an excellent dressing and 
polishing material. Calcium alginate, which is insoluble in water, has been used in the manufacture 
of a medical dressing very suitable for burns and extensive wounds where a normal dressing would 
be extremely difficult to remove; calcium alginate is extruded to make a fiber which is then woven 
into a gauze-like product; alginates with a high proportion of guluronic acid blocks are most suit -
able for this purpose. When applied to either a wound or burn, a network is formed around which a 
healthy scab may form; the bandage may be removed with a sodium chloride solution, which renders 
the alginate soluble in water. Alginates are also used as a thickening paste for colors in printing tex -
tiles, as a hardener and thickener for joining threads in weaving; the alginates may subsequently be 
dissolved away, giving special effects to the material. Other uses include glazing and sizing paper, 
special printers’ inks, paints, cosmetics, insecticides, and pharmaceutical preparations. In the USA, 
alginates are frequently used as stabilizers in ice-cream, giving a smooth texture and body, and also 
as a suspending agent in milk shakes. Alginates take up atomically heavy metals in a series of affini -
ties; for example, lead and other heavy metals will be taken up in preference to sodium, potassium, 
and other “lighter” metals; accordingly, alginates are useful in lead and strontium-90 poisoning.289 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCTwenty-five to thirty years ago, almost all extraction of alginates took place in Europe, USA, and 
Japan. The major change in the alginates industry over the last decade has been the emergence of 
producers in China in the 1980s. Initially, production was limited to low-cost, low-quality alginate 
for the local industrial markets produced from locally cultivated Laminaria  (Saccharina) japonica . 
By the 1990s, producers in China were competing in Western industrial markets for alginates, pri -
marily based on low cost.
Some 35,000 tons of alginates per annum are extracted worldwide. Alginate manufacturing in 
the USA has ceased to exist, whereas Europe (mainly Scotland and Norway) is still able to maintain 
a fairly substantial part of their alginate industry even though Europe is a high-cost production 
region. This is primarily due to FMC company’s ability to increase their market share of high-
quality, specialty grades of alginates being sold in developed countries. Of the 8900 tons year−1 
of alginates still being produced in Europe, two-thirds is being produced by FMC in its Norway 
facility. Asia-Pacific, on the other hand, is where the real capacity growth has taken place, but at the 
same time markets for this capacity is mostly in the Asia-Pacific region.
About 15 years ago, Ascophyllum nodosum  and Macrocystis  pyrifera  accounted for 58% of the 
harvest, while today Laminaria  and Lessonia  species are dominant, accounting for 81% of the world 
harvest. Ireland, Scotland, Iceland, France, and Canada possess substantial resources of A. nodosum  
seaweed, but this species is now relatively costly to harvest, and the extract quality is not competitive 
with other species, so hardly any is being used today. In addition, special A. nodosum  extracts are 
finding new, more profitable markets as a source of animal and plant nutrients and growth promot -
ers. The giant kelp M. pyrifera  was in the past an important raw material for the alginate industry, 
particularly Kelco in San Diego (Figure 7.12); it was harvested from large offshore beds off the 
coasts of California and Mexico. Macrocystis  has the distinction of being the largest macroalga in 
the world; the largest attached plant recorded was 65-m long and the plants are capable of growing 
at up to 50 cm per day.
A. nodosum  and Laminaria hyperborea  are used in Norway and Scotland. Ascophyllum  is sus -
tainably harvested in Ireland to produce macroalgae meal that is exported to Scotland for alginate 
extraction. Norway processes Laminaria hyperborea , manufacturing high-quality alginates.
Carrageenan
Of the three categories of hydrocolloids under consideration, carrageenan is the most difficult to char -
acterize, mainly because of its chemical complexity. This polysaccharide built up from d-galactopy -
ranose units only, has many chemical forms: the brittle gel-forming kappa, the elastic gel-forming 
iota, and the nongelling, but commercially unavailable, lambda. To replace lambda in cold soluble 
applications, the mu/nu hybrids obtained from Chilean Gigartina  (Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae) 
and Sarcothalia  (Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae) species are used. Alkali treatment of these extracts 
yields kappa/iota hybrids that find use in dairy and toothpaste products. Kappa carrageenan today 
is almost exclusively obtained from farmed Kappaphycus alvarezii  (Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae) 
and iota from farmed Eucheuma denticulatum  (Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae).
The word carrageenan is derived from the colloquial Irish name for this macroalgae, carrageen 
(from the Irish place name, probably Carrigeen Head in Co. Donegal, Carraigín; “little rock”) and 
the use of this macroalgae to extract a gel is known in Ireland since 1810. Chondrus crispus  (Irish 
moss, Figure 7.2) used to be the sole source of carrageenan, but species of Eucheuma , Ahnfeltia  
(Rhodophyta, Florideophyceae), and Gigartina  are now commonly used. About 50,000 tons of 
carrageenan are manufactured worldwide, and although Chondrus  is no longer the unique source, 
it is still the principal one. Modern carrageenan is a branded product designed, by mixing various 
types of carrageenan, to give a gel with particular qualities. Most of the Chondrus  that is used in 
the carrageenan industry comes from the Maritime Provinces of Canada (Nova Scotia, etc.), where 
C. crispus  is harvested from natural populations. The bulk of the harvest is collected using long-
handled rakes and dredges from small boats. The macroalgae is then dried, either by spreading and 
air-drying or by using rotary dryers, and exported to the USA and Denmark for processing.290 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCCarrageenan production was originally dependent on wild macroalgae, especially C. crispus , 
with a limited resource base in France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the east coast provinces of 
Canada. As the carrageenan industry expanded, the demand for raw material began to strain the 
supply from natural resources. However, since the early 1970s, the industry has expanded rapidly 
following the availability of other carrageenan-containing macroalgae that have been successfully 
cultivated in warm-water countries with low labor costs.
The seaweeds for production of carrageenan are dominated by the warm water species K. alvare -
zii (cottonii ) and E. denticulatum  (spinosum ). Both are being cultivated by vegetative growth primar -
ily in the Philippines and Indonesia with smaller amounts from Tanzania. The other seaweeds being 
used are cold water species: Sarcothalia crispata  and Gigartina skottsbergii  (Gigartina radula  of 
commerce) coming mainly from Chile with smaller amounts from Mexico. C. crispus , another cold-
water carrageenophyte, comes predominantly from Maritimes Canada with smaller amounts from 
France but is declining in availability and use. None of these cold-water weeds is cultivated, so supply 
depends entirely on the natural harvest. These cold-water weeds are needed to supply specific types 
of carrageenan that cannot be obtained from the cultivated, warm water weeds.
Twenty-five years ago, almost all carrageenan extraction took place in Western Europe and USA 
with the remainder taking place in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Since then, the situation has 
changed considerably and in particular with the introduction of human food-grade semi-refined car -
rageenan (PES). From its start in the mid-1970s, PES has progressively reconfigured the geographic 
distribution of production facilities as well as increasing the percent of PES being produced.

There is a long history of coastal people using macroalgae, especially the large brown macroalgae, 
to fertilize nearby land. Wet macroalgae is heavy, so it was not usually carried very far inland, 
although on the west coast of Ireland enthusiasm was such that it was transported several kilometers 
from the shore. Generally drift macroalgae or beach-washed macroalgae is collected, although in 
Scotland farmers sometimes cut Ascophyllum  exposed at low tide. In Cornwall, UK, the practice 
was to mix the macroalgae with sand, let it rot, and then dig it in. For over a few hundred kilometers 
of the coast line around Brittany, France, the beach-cast, brown macroalgae is regularly collected 
by farmers and used on fields up to a kilometer inland. Similar practices can be reported for many 
countries around the world. For example, in a more tropical climate like the Philippines, large 
quantities of Sargassum  have been collected, used wet locally, but also sun-dried and transported 
to other areas. In Puerto Madryn, Argentina, large quantities of green macroalgae are cast ashore 
every summer and interfere with recreational uses of beaches. Part of this algal mass has been com -
posted and then used in trials for growing tomato plants in various types of soil. In all cases, the 
addition of the compost increased water-holding capacity and plant growth, so composting simulta -
neously solved environmental pollution problems and produced a useful organic fertilizer.
Macroalgae meal is dried, milled macroalgae, and again it is usually based on the brown mac -
roalgae because they are the most readily available in large quantities. Species of Ascophyllum , 
Ecklonia , and Fucus  (Ochrophyta, Pheophyceae) are the common ones. They are sold as soil addi -
tives and function as both fertilizers and soil conditioners. They have a suitable content of nitro -
gen and potassium, but are much lower in phosphorus than traditional animal manures and the 
typical N:P:K ratios in chemical fertilizers. The large amounts of insoluble carbohydrates in brown 
macroalgae act as soil conditioners (improve aeration and soil structure, especially in clay soils) 
and have good moisture-retention properties. Their effectiveness as fertilizers is also sometimes 
attributed to the trace elements they contain, but the actual contribution they make is very small 
compared to normal plant requirements. One company in Ireland that produces milled macroalgae 
for the alginate industry is developing applications for macroalgae meal in Mediterranean fruit and 
vegetable cultivation. “Afrikelp” is another example of a commercially available dried macroalgae, 
sold as a fertilizer and soil conditioner; it is based on the brown macroalgae Ecklonia maxima  that 
is washed up on the beaches of the west coast of Africa and Namibia. Like all brown macroalgae, 
Ascophyllum  contains alginate, a carbohydrate composed of long chains. When calcium is added 
to alginate, it forms strong gels. By composting the dried, powdered Ascophyllum  under controlled 
conditions for 11–12 days, the alginate chains are broken into smaller chains and these chains still 
form gels with calcium but they are weaker. The composted product is a dark brown, granular 
material containing 20–25% of water and it can be easily stored and used in this form. Steep slopes 
are difficult to cultivate with conventional equipment and are likely to suffer soil loss by runoff. 
Spraying such slopes with composted Ascophyllum , clay, fertilizer, seed, mulch, and water has 
given good results, even on bare rock. Plants quickly grow and topsoil forms after a few years. 
The spray is thixotropic, that is, it is fluid when a force is applied to spread it but it sets to a weak 
gel when standing for a time and sticks to the sloping surface. It holds any soil in place and retains 
enough moisture to allow the seeds to germinate. Composted Ascophyllum  has been used after the 
construction of roads in a number of countries and has found other uses as well.
Maerl  is the common name of a fertilizer derived from calcareous red algae; maerl  beds are char -
acterized by accumulations of living and dead unattached nongeniculate calcareous Florideophyceae 
(mostly Corallinales such as Phymatolithon calcareum  and Lithothamnion corallioides ). Also 
known as rhodolith beds, these habitats occur in tropical, temperate, and polar environments. In 
Europe, they are known from throughout the Mediterranean and along most of the Western Atlantic 
coast from Portugal to Norway, although they are rare in the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea, 
and Baltic Sea. Maerl  beds are often found in subdued light conditions and their depth limit depends 
primarily on the degree of light penetration. In the northeast Atlantic, maerl  beds occur from low in 292 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthe intertidal to about 30-m depth; in the West Mediterranean, they are found down to 90–100 m, 
while in the East they occur down to depths of about 180 m. Maerl  beds in subtidal waters have 
been utilized over a long period in Britain, with early references dating back to 1690. In France also, 
maerl  has been used as a soil fertilizer for several centuries. Extraction of maerl , either from beds 
where live thalli are present or where the maerl  is dead or semifossilized, has been carried out in 
Europe for hundreds of years. Initially, the quantities extracted were small, being dug by hand from 
intertidal banks, but in the 1970s about 600,000 tons of maerl  was extracted per annum in France 
alone. Amounts have declined to about 500,000 tons per annum since then, though maerl  extrac -
tion still forms a major part of the French seaweed industry, both in terms of quantity and value of 
harvest. Live maerl  extraction is obviously very problematic with regard to growth rates for replace -
ment. Dead maerl  extraction is liable to lead to muddy plumes and excessive sediment load in water 
that later settles out and smothers surrounding communities.
The maerl  is marketed mainly for use as an agricultural fertilizer, for soil improvement in hor -
ticulture, mainly to replace lime as an agricultural soil conditioner. There are conflicting reports 
on the benefits of maerl  use as opposed to the use of dolomite or calcium carbonate limestone. 
Other uses include: as an animal food additive, for biological denitrification and in neutralization 
of acidic water in the production of drinking water, aquarium gravel as well as in the pharma -
ceutical, cosmetics, nuclear, and medical industries. These uses are all related to the chemical 
composition of maerl , which is primarily composed of calcium and magnesium carbonates. It is 
occasionally used for miscellaneous other purposes such as hardcore for filling roads and surfac -
ing garden paths.
Maerl  beds are analogous to the sea-grass beds or kelp forests in that they are structurally and 
functionally complex perennial habitats formed by marine algae that support a very rich biodiver -
sity. The high biodiversity associated with maerl  grounds is generally attributed to their complex 
architecture. Long-lived maerl  thalli and their dead remains build up on underlying sediments to 
produce deposits with a three-dimensional structure that is intermediate in character between hard 
and soft grounds. Maerl  thalli grow very slowly such that maerl  deposits may take hundreds of years 
to develop, especially in high latitudes. One of the most obvious threats is commercial extraction, 
as this has led to the wholesale removal of maerl  habitats (e.g., from five sites around the coasts of 
Brittany), while areas adjacent to extraction sites show significant reductions in diversity and abun -
dance. Even if the proportion of living maerl  in commercially collected material is low, extraction 
has major effects on the wide range of species present in both live and dead maerl  deposits. Brittany 
is the main area for maerl  extraction with about 500,000 tons extracted annually; smaller amounts 
are extracted in southwest England and southwest Ireland. Maerl  beds represent a nonrenewable 
resource as extraction and disruption far out-strips their slow rate of accumulation. In France, maerl  
extraction is now considered to be “mining” which implies more constraints for the extractors and 
more controls on the impact of extraction. Scientists, managers, and policy makers have been slow 
to react to an escalating degradation of these habitats such that there is now an urgent need to protect 
these systems from severe human impacts.
Macroalgae extracts and suspensions have achieved a broader use and market than macroal -
gae and macroalgae meal. They are sold in concentrated form, are easy to transport, dilute, and 
apply, and act more rapidly. They are all made from brown macroalgae, although the species 
varies between countries. Some are made by alkaline extraction of the macroalgae and anything 
that does not dissolve is removed by filtration; others are suspensions of very fine particles of 
macroalgae.
Macroalgae extracts have given positive results in many applications. There are probably other 
applications where they have not made significant improvements, but these receive less, if any, 
publicity. However, there is no doubt that macroalgae extracts are now widely accepted in the hor -
ticultural industry. When applied to fruit, vegetable, and flower crops, some improvements have 
included higher yields, increased uptake of soil nutrients, increased resistance to some pests such 
as red spider mite and aphids, improved seed germination, and more resistance to frost. There have 293 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCbeen many controlled studies to show the value of using macroalgae extracts, with mixed results. 
For example, they may improve the yield of one cultivar of potato but not another grown under the 
same conditions. No one is really sure about why they are effective, despite many studies having 
been made. The trace element content is insufficient to account for the improved yields, etc. It has 
been shown that most of the extracts contain several types of plant growth regulators such as cyto -
kinins, auxins, and betaines, but even here there is no clear evidence that these alone are respon -
sible for the improvements. Finally, there is the question, are macroalgae extracts an economically 
attractive alternative to NPK fertilizers? Perhaps not when used on their own, but when used with 
NPK fertilizers they improve the effectiveness of the fertilizers, so less can be used, with a lowering 
of costs. Then there are always those who prefer an “organic” or “natural” fertilizer, especially in 
horticulture, so macroalgae extracts probably have a bright future.
The use of macroalgae as fertilizers dates back at least to the nineteenth century. Early usage 
was by coastal dwellers, who collected storm-cast macroalgae, usually large brown macroalgae, 
and dug it into local soils. The high fiber content of the macroalgae acts as a soil conditioner and 
assists moisture retention, whereas the mineral content is a useful fertilizer and a source of trace 
elements. In the early twentieth century, a small industry developed based on the drying and mill -
ing of mainly storm-cast material, but it dwindled with the advent of synthetic chemical fertilizers. 
Today, with the rising popularity of organic farming, there has been some revival of the industry, 
but not yet on a large scale; the combined costs of drying and transportation have confined usage to 
sunnier climates where the buyers are not too distant from the coast. Liquid macroalgae extracts are 
the growth area in macroalgae fertilizers. These can be produced in concentrated form for dilution 
by the user. Several can be applied directly onto plants or they can be watered in, around the root 
areas. Several scientific studies have proved the effectiveness of these products, and macroalgae 
extracts are now widely accepted in the horticultural industry. No one is really sure of the reasons 
for their effectiveness: the trace element content is insufficient to account for the improved yields, 
for example. In 1991, it was estimated that about 10,000 tons of wet macroalgae were used annu -
ally to make 1000 tons of macroalgae extracts with a value of US $5 million. However, since that 
time the market has probably doubled as the usefulness of these products has become more widely 
recognized and organic farming has increased in popularity.
cosme Tics
To date, microalgal extracts can be found in many face and skin-care products, for example, anti-
aging cream, refreshing, or regenerative care products, sun cream, emollient, and anti-irritant in 
peelers. Dermochlorella is actually extracted from Chlorella vulgaris , which can stimulate collagen 
synthesis in skin-supporting tissue regeneration and wrinkle reduction. Protulines is a protein-rich 
extract from Arthrospira  (Spirulina ), which helps combat early skin aging, exerting a tightening 
effect, and preventing wrinkle formation.
More generally, extracts of algae are often found on the list of ingredients on cosmetic packages, 
particularly in face, hand, and body creams or lotions, but the use of algae themselves in cosmetics, 
rather than extracts of them, is rather limited.
Milled macroalgae, packed in sachets, are sold as an additive to bath water, sometimes with 
essential oils being added. Bath salts with macroalgae meal are also sold. Thalassotherapy has come 
into fashion in recent years, especially in France. In thalassotherapy, macroalgae pastes, made by 
cold-grinding or freeze-crushing, are applied to the person’s body and then warmed under infra -
red radiation. This treatment, in conjunction with seawater hydrotherapy, is said to provide relief 
for rheumatism and osteoporosis. Mineral-rich seawater is used in a range of therapies, including 
hydrotherapy, massage, and a variety of marine mud and algae treatments. One of the treatments is 
to cover a person’s body with a paste of fine particles of macroalgae, sometimes wrap them in cling 
wrap, and warm the body with infrared lamps. It is said to be useful in various ways, including relief 
of rheumatic pain or the removal of cellulite. Paste mixtures are also used in massage creams, with 294 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCpromises to rapidly restore elasticity and suppleness to the skin. The macroalgae pastes are made 
by freeze-grinding or crushing. The macroalgae is washed, cleaned, and then frozen in slabs. The 
slabs are either pressed against a grinding wheel or crushed, sometimes with additional freezing 
with liquid nitrogen that makes the frozen material more brittle and easier to grind or crush. The 
result is a fine green paste of macroalgae.
There appears to be no shortage of products with ingredients and claims linked to macroalgae: 
creams, face masks, shampoos, body gels, bath salts, and even a do-it-yourself body wrap kit. The 
efficacy of these products must be judged by the user. One company recently pointed out that the 
lifetime of cosmetic products has reduced over the years and now rarely exceeds 3 or 4 years. 
Perhaps the macroalgae products that are really effective will live longer than this.
Cosmetic products, such as creams and lotions, sometimes show on their labels that the contents 
include “marine extract,” “extract of alga,” “macroalgae extract,” or similar. This usually means 
that one of the hydrocolloids extracted from macroalgae has been added. Alginate or carrageenan 
could improve the skin moisture-retention properties of the product.
FUNCTIONAL FOODS AND NUTRACEUTICALS
There is a strong body of science underpinning health benefits from foods, and new, different, 
natural sources of so-called “functional foods” and “nutraceuticals” are continuously investigated 
and tested for their applicability in improving health and reduce risk through prevention. A working 
definition of functional food was proposed by EC Concerted Action on Functional Food Science in 
Europe (FUFOSE): a food that beneficially affects one or more target functions in the body beyond 
adequate nutritional effects in a way that is relevant to either an improved state of health and well-
being and/or reduction of risk of disease. It is consumed as part of a normal food pattern. It is not a 
pill, a capsule, or any form of dietary supplement. A working definition has been recently suggested 
also for the portmanteau word “nutraceutical,” coined in 1989 by Dr. S. De Felice from the terms 
“nutrition” and “pharmaceutical”: a nutraceutical is a food or a part of a food for oral administration 
with demonstrated safety and health benefits beyond the basic nutritional functions to supplement 
diet, presented in a nonfood matrix or nonconventional food formats, in such a quantity that exceeds 
those that could be obtained from normal foods and with such frequency as required to realize 
such properties, and is labeled as a “nutraceutical.” Despite the different definitions, the boundary 
between functional foods and nutraceuticals is not always clear and the main difference is the for -
mat in which they are consumed: functional foods are always consumed as ordinary foods, while 
nutraceuticals are consumed as pills, tablets, etc.
In this perspective, algae, both micro- and macroalgae (seaweed), are a largely untapped reser -
voir still to be explored. As already said in the Introduction, algae have a history of consumption all 
over the world and have made base of eastern countries, such as Japan, Korea, China, Philippines, 
and Indonesia, diet since prehistorical period, with the earliest recorded use dating back to 2700 
bc. In Japan, about 50 species of algae are used as foods, with an estimated annual consumption 
per person of 1.4 kg. This ancient tradition and everyday habit has made possible a large number of 
epidemiological researches showing the health benefits linked to algae consumption. Observational 
data collected in South East Asian populations give a strong indication of the association between 
algae intake, reduced disease risk, and health outcomes. The Japanese, in particular, have one of 
the lowest rates of obesity in the world, a life expectancy very long (83 years), low rate of heart-
related deaths, and an extraordinarily low rate of certain types of cancer. In contrast, highly caloric 
diets typical of Western developed countries together with a decrease in physical activity due to 
a modified sedentary lifestyle have caused an increase in the incidence of obesity and associated 
comorbidities at an epidemic rate.
Algae can be considered both functional food because of their high-quality nutritional value 
(protein content, presence of all of the essential amino acids in level sufficient to meet normal 
nutritional requirements) and nutraceuticals, because of their content in bioactive ingredient, such 295 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCas ω-3 essential PUFA (e.g., DHA, EPA), sterols, minerals (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Mg, and iodine), carot -
enoids (e.g., β-carotene, astaxanthin), essential vitamins (e.g. A, B1, B2, C, D, E), polyphenols, and 
polysaccharides (e.g., alginate, fucoidan, β-glucan). Many of these bioactive ingredients have been 
tested in clinical trials or are under validation to assess their efficacy in tackling vitality issues, 
especially in the field of lipid metabolism, oxidative cellular stress, cancer, and neurological and 
cardiovascular diseases. For example, some of the general effects of algal PUFAs include anti -
arteriosclerosis, antihypertension, antiinflammation, and immunoregulation. Pigments and poly -
phenols have shown bioactivity effect toward cancer, as antioxidant and antiinflammatory; algal 
polysaccharides, most of which cannot be digested in the human gastrointestinal tract, act as a 
good source of dietary fibers, which stimulate human health, by creating a better intestinal envi -
ronment, or because of their hypocholesterolemic and hypolipidemic properties. Because of their 
precious content of high-value compounds, algae are systematically screened for these substances 
as exploitable functional food, nutraceutical. Many of these compounds have been tested also as 
therapeutic supplement.
Table 7.3 shows the main bioactive compounds present in algae, with the corresponding health 
effects. In the following, details will be given on some of these algal compounds.
Among prokaryotic microalgae, the cyanobacterium Arthrospira  sp. has undergone numerous 
and rigorous toxicological studies that have highlighted its potential therapeutic applications in the 
area of immunomodulation, anticancer, antiviral, and cholesterol-reduction effects. A number of 
extracts were found to be remarkably active in protecting human lymphoblastoid T-cells from the 
cytopathic effects of HIV infection.
Active agents consisting of sulfolipids with different fatty acid esters were isolated also 
from Lyngbya lagerheimii  and Phormidium tenue.  Additional cultured cyanobacterial extracts 
with inhibitory properties were also found in Phormidium cebennse , Oscilatoria raciborskii , 
Scytonema burmanicum , Calotrix elenkinii , and Anabaena variabilis.  A protein called cyano -
virin, isolated from an aqueous cellular extract of Nostoc elipsosporum  prevents the in vitro  rep-
lication and citopathicity of primate retroviruses. Cryptophycin 1, an active compound isolated 
from Nostoc  strain GSV224, exerts antiproliferative and antimitotic activity by binding to the 
ends of the microtubules, thus blocking the cell cycle at the metaphase of mitosis. Cryptophycin 
1 is the most potent suppressor of microtubule dynamics yet described. It belongs to the family of 
cryptophycins, potent anticancer agents at picomolar concentrations, which exert their cytotoxic 
effects in both alkaloid- and taxol-resistant cancer cells that contribute to the proliferation of drug-
resistant tumors.
Other studies using water-soluble extracts of cyanobacteria have found a novel sulfated polysac -
charide, calcium spirulan to be an antiviral agent. This compound appears to be selectively inhibit -
ing the penetration of enveloped viruses into host cells, thereby preventing the replication. Using 
specific assays for the quantification of viral replication in vitro , spirulan exhibited strong inhibition 
of human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1, human herpes virus type 6, and human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1.
Among eukaryotic microalgae, a polypeptide has been separated from Chlorella pyrenoidosa , 
which exhibited inhibitory activity on human liver cancer HepG2 cells. It has been named CPAP 
(C. pyrenoidosa  antitumor polypeptide).
Apart from these very specific compounds, as already stated, the general beneficial effect of 
microalgae is attributed to their content in pigments, carotenoids, in particular, PUFAs and polysac -
charides. Carotenoids (both carotenes and xanthophylls) are tetraterpenoid organic pigments that 
serve two key roles in algae: they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis and they protect 
chlorophyll from photodamage. There has been much interest in carotenoids, especially their effect 
on human health, because they have a market value of several hundred million Euros. Their chemi -
cal synthesis is still a demanding challenge for chemists. The major dietary source of vitamin A 
(essential for cell growth, embryonic development, vision, and immune system functioning) for 
mammals, including humans, is derived from carotenoids.296 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCCarotenoids by their quenching action on reactive oxygen species carry intrinsic antiinflammatory 
properties, whereas PUFAs exhibit antioxidant activity and polysaccharides act as immunostimulators.
A major bottleneck in the exploitation of microalgal biomass for the production of high-value 
compounds is low productivity of the culture, both in terms of biomass and product formation. 
One fundamental reason for this is slow cell growth rates owing to inefficient use of strong light. 
Furthermore, most microalgal products are secondary metabolites that are produced when growth is 
limited. One solution to this bottleneck could be to milk the secondary metabolites from the micro -
algae. This involves continuous removal of secondary metabolites from cells, thereby enabling the 
biomass to be reused for the continuous production of high-value compounds.TABLE 7.3

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCRecently, a new method was developed for milking β-carotene from Dunaliella salina  in a 
two-phase bioreactor. In this technique, cells are first grown under normal growth conditions and 
then stressed by excess light to produce larger amounts of β-carotene. At this stage, the second, 
biocompatible organic phase is added and the β-carotene is extracted selectively via continuous 
recirculation of a biocompatible organic solvent (lipophilic compound) through the aqueous phase 
containing the cells. Because the cells continue to produce β-carotene, the extracted product is con -
tinuously replaced by newly produced molecules. Therefore, the cells are continuously reused and 
do not need to be grown again. In contrast to existing commercial processes, this method does not 
require the harvesting, concentrating, and destroying of cells for extraction of the desired product. 
Furthermore, purification of the product is simple owing to the selectivity of the extraction process. 
The general application of this process would facilitate the commercialization of microalgal bio -
technology and development of microalgal products.
The properties of the cell membrane play an important role in the contact between biocompatible 
lipophilic solvents, and hydrophobic parts of the cell membrane might be prevented by the presence of 
a cell wall and/or hydrophilic parts of the outer membrane. Physiological properties of the cells, such 
as their capacity for continuous endo- and exo-cytosis, might also play a role in the milking process. 
Other considerations are the location and way in which the product accumulates inside the cells and 
the function of that product inside the cells. A product such as chlorophyll would be difficult to extract 
owing to its location in thylakoid membranes and because it is bound strongly to other cell components. 
The extraction of a product with a protective effect on the cells (e.g., β-carotene) will enhance its syn -
thesis. The milking process can also be applied to other algae and other products besides D. salina , for 
example, in Haematococcus pluvialis  for the recovery astaxanthin, and marine microalgae for PUFAs.
In addition to its use in aquaculture (e.g., to give salmon a pink color), astaxanthin has also been 
described as having nutraceutical importance related to free-radical scavenging, immunomodula -
tion, and cancer prevention. H. pluvialis  can produce and accumulate astaxanthin to concentrations 
of 1–8% of the dry weight. This concentration within the cell would make milking of H. pluvialis  
more successful compared with D. salina.  However, cultivation of H. pluvialis  is more complex 
than D. salina , and productivity is lower. Furthermore, extraction, purification, and concentration 
are a heavy burden on the production cost. As the final product cost is also sensitive to algal produc -
tivity and duration of the growth period, this process is not economically feasible at present.
PUFAs are gaining increasing importance as valuable pharmaceutical products and ingredi -
ents of food owing to their beneficial effect on human health. DHA (22:6 ω3) and EPA (20:5 ω3), 
in particular, are important in the development and functioning of brain, retina, and reproductive 
tissues both in adults and infants. They can also be used in the treatment of various diseases and 
disorders, including cardiovascular problems, a variety of cancers, and inflammatory disease. At 
present, PUFAs are produced commercially from fish oil, but this is an insufficient source of these 
products, and microalgae provide an optimal lipid source of PUFAs. Microalgal-derived PUFAs, 
such as AA (arachidonic acid) and DHA, are added as fortifications to infant formulae—an industry 
that is worth $10 billion per annum alone.
Microalgae are the primary producers of EPA and DHA that are eventually accumulated through 
the various trophic levels. Changes in microalgal lipid content are carried on up the food chain, 
impacting the growth and dietary make-up of zooplankton, crustacean larvae, mollusc, and some 
fish. This subsequently affects the accumulation of EPA and DHA fatty acids in higher organisms 
and humans. Consequently, lipid profiles in microalgae play a vital role in maintaining the integrity 
of the world’s aquatic food webs.
Several heterotrophic microalgae have been used as biofactories for omega-3 fatty acids 
commercially, but a strong interest also in autotrophic microalgae has emerged in recent years. 
To date, the ω-3 fatty acid content of numerous microalgae strains have been studied. Strains 
from the genera Phaeodactylum , Nannochloropsis , Thraustochytrium , and Schizochytrium  
have demonstrated high accumulation of EPA and/or DHA. Phaeodactylum tricornutum  and 
Nannochloropsis  sp. demonstrated an EPA content of up to 39% of total fatty acids, while strains 298 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCsuch as Thraustochytrium  and Schizochytrium limacinum  contained a DHA percentage of between 
30% and 40% of total fatty acids when grown heterotrophically. High biomass and commercially 
acceptable EPA and DHA productivities are achieved with microalgae grown in media with opti -
mized carbon and nitrogen concentrations and controlled pH and temperature conditions. High oil 
production, including DHA from Schizochytrium  (50% w/w), can be obtained as a result of high 
growth rate by controlling nutrients such as glucose, nitrogen, sodium, and some other environ -
mental factors, such as oxygen concentration as well as temperature and pH, achieving high cell 
densities and DHA productivities.
The heterotrophic marine dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii  has a lipid content greater than 
20% d.w. and is known for its ability to accumulate fatty acids that have a high fraction (30–50%) 
of DHA. Lipids are not only important components of algal cell membranes, but also accumulate 
in globules in other parts of the cells. Microalga growth and fatty acid formation are affected by 
medium composition and environmental conditions (e.g., carbon sources). Lipid production occurs 
under growth-limiting conditions; during linear growth, the cells are stressed owing to nutrient 
limitation and therefore produce more lipids. Also the concentration of DHA, hence the lipid qual -
ity, is negatively affected by increases in lipid concentration. The highest quality lipid is obtained 
when glucose is used as the carbon source, and when the cell concentration and lipid content of the 
cells are the lowest.
Milking can also be used for DHA production by C. cohnii . In this process, cells are first grown 
under the correct conditions for growth, after which they are stressed to produce higher concentra -
tions of DHA. A biocompatible organic solvent is added during the DHA production stage to extract 
the product. This process enables the production of high-quality lipid, thereby reducing extrac -
tion and purification costs. Furthermore, higher amounts of DHA are produced by substitution of 
extracted lipids by newly synthesized lipid, increasing the productivity of the system.
An EPA production potential has also been found in the genus Nitzschia  (especially N. alba  and 
N. laevis ). It was reported that the oil content of N. alba  was as high as 50% of cell dry weight and 
the EPA comprised 4–5% of the oil. N. laevis  could utilize glucose or glutamate as single substrate 
for heterotrophic growth, and the cellular EPA content of the alga in heterotrophic conditions was 
also higher than that in photoautotrophic conditions, suggesting that this diatom is a good hetero -
trophic EPA producer.
From a production point of view, an increase in microalgal lipid content can be induced by a sud -
den change of growth conditions. The accumulation of starch and/or lipids reserves is considered 
a survival mechanism in response to growth-limiting stresses, such as UV radiation, temperature, 
and shock or nutrient deprivation, as long as light conditions are present that still allow for efficient 
photosynthesis. For example, during nutritional deprivation (e.g., nitrogen) and under the provision 
of light, cellular division of many marine or brackish microalgae is put on hold and cells begin to 
accumulate lipids, leading to a 2–3-fold increase in lipid content. Both total lipid and omega-3 fatty 
acid production can be adjusted by varying growth conditions. The diatom P. tricornutum  can be 
induced to increase its lipid level from 81.2 mg/g of culture dry weight to 168.5 mg/g dry weight, 
and Nannochloropsis  sp. and Dunaliella  sp. can achieve a total lipid content of up to 47% and 60% 
of dry ash weight by modifying the light intensity, temperature, and salinity levels.
ω-3 fatty acid biosynthesis can be stimulated by a number of environmental stresses, such as low 
temperature, change of salinity, or UV radiation. For example, Pavlova lutheri  increased its rela -
tive EPA content from 20.3 to 30.3 M% when the culture temperature is reduced to 15°C. Similarly, 
P. tricornutum  had a higher EPA content when the temperature is shifted from 25°C to 10°C for 12 h.
Salinity may also regulate PUFA biosynthesis; for example, C. cohnii  increases its total DHA 
content up to 56.9% of total fatty acids when cultured in 9 g/L NaCl. Other treatments that cause 
the generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation also result in higher PUFA contents. 
For example, P. tricornutum  increased its EPA content up to 19.84% when stressed with UV light. 
Some of the increased PUFAs are used to repair membrane damage but as PUFAs contain many 
double bonds, these also act as an antioxidant by scavenging free radicals.299 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCApart from external stresses, metabolic engineering is another promising approach to increase 
the production of fatty acids in microalgae. Genes encoding key enzymes involved in the fatty acid 
biosynthesis have been identified in Ostreococcus tauri , Thalassiosira pseudonana , P. tricornutum , 
and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii .
As to macroalgae, extracts from several species may prove to be a source of effective antiviral 
agents; although the tests have been either in vitro  (in test tubes or similar) or on animals, with 
few advancing to trials involving people. A notable exception is Carraguard, a mixture of car -
rageenans similar to those extracted from Irish moss. Carraguard has been shown to be effective 
against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro  and against herpes simplex virus in animals. 
Testing advanced to Phase 3 clinical trial in South Africa, with the Contribution of Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation. This was the first Phase-3 trial of a novel candidate microbicide to be conducted 
among a general population of 6000 women and completed as planned in 4 years without any 
safety concerns. The trial did not show that Carraguard is effective in preventing HIV transmis -
sion during vaginal sex, but confirmed its safety that could make it a potentially useful vehicle for 
future  microbicides.
Extracts from the brown macroalga Undaria pinnatifida  have also shown antiviral activity; an 
Australian company is involved in several clinical trials, in Australia and the United States, of such 
an extract against HIV and cancer. Because antiviral substances in macroalgae are composed of 
very large molecules, it was thought they would not be absorbed by eating macroalgae. However, 
it has been found in one survey that the rate of HIV infection in macroalgae-eating communities 
can be markedly lower than it is elsewhere. This has led to some small-scale trials in which people 
infected with HIV ate powdered Undaria , with a resulting decrease of 25% in the viral load.
Fucoxanthin, a carotenoid commonly distributed in brown algae, such as U. pinnatifida , 
Scytosiphon lomentaria , Petalonia binghamiae , and Laminaria religiosa , is a potent drug candi -
date and can be utilized as an excellent supplement such as astaxanthin, since it acts as an antioxi -
dant and inhibits GOTO cells of neuroblastoma and colon cancer cells. Recently, apoptosis activity 
of fucoxanthin against HL-60 (human leukema) and Caco-2 (cancer colon) cells has been reported.
Algae, especially marine algae, contain a large amount of structural polysaccharides (e.g., cel -
lulose, hemicellulose), storage polysaccharides (e.g., glucan, fucoidan, agar, carrageenan), and 
mucopolysaccharides (e.g., porphyran). Most of these polysaccharides are not digested by humans 
and therefore can be defined as functional fibers, that is, physiologically beneficial nondigestible 
carbohydrates. These polysaccharides may be a constituent of the cell wall as in unicellular red 
algae as Porphyridium  sp. and Rhodella  sp., or be present inside the cell, as in the Euglenophyceae. 
The polysaccharides of Rhodophyta are highly sulfated and consist mainly of xylose, glucose, and 
galactose. These compounds selectively inhibit reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme of human immu -
nodeficiency virus (HIV) and its replication in vitro . Rodents fed with a diet supplemented with 
biomass and polysaccharide derived from Porphyridium  results in a decrease in blood cholesterol 
concentration (by 22% and 29%, respectively) and triglyceride levels, increased feces weight (by 
130% and 196%, respectively) and bile acid excretion (5.1- and 3.2-folds more). Moreover, algal bio -
mass or polysaccharide increased the length of both the small intestine (by 17% and 30%, respec -
tively) and the colon (by 8.5% and 32%, respectively).
Also β-glucans in algae are present as storage polysaccharides or wall components. The have 
been identified as water-soluble polysaccharides in brown algae (laminaran, also called laminarin), 
diatoms (chrysolaminarin), chrysophytes (chrysolaminarin, also called leucosin), and other ochro -
phytes. Laminarans are maybe among the most investigated glucans; these polymers are extracted 
from kelps ( Laminaria  sp., Eicenia  sp.) as a by-product from production of alginic acid. They 
consist of glucopyranosyl residues linked by β-1,3-d-glycosidic bonds or β-1,6-d branched β-1,3-
d-glycosidic bonds; laminaran from Eicenia bicyclis  has a molecular weight of 6.17 kDa, while 
laminaran from L. digitata  weights 5.85 kDa. Laminarans are easily soluble in neutral water, and 
can be fermented by human fecal bacteria easier than other brown algal polysaccharides, such as 
alginate, fucoidan, and cellulose.300 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCParamylon is the term used for the reserve β-glucans of Euglena  and euglenoids in general. Its 
granules appearing in various locations inside the cell; in many species, they are scattered through -
out the cytoplasm, but others can be massed together or few, but large, and located in a fairly 
constant position. Their shape and size differ markedly, and together with their distribution inside 
the cell, represent a taxonomic feature. Paramylon from Euglena gracilis  can be considered a quite 
particular case. E. gracilis  non-photosynthetic WSLZ mutant can accumulate large amounts of 
paramylon, up to 95% of the cell mass, when grown in the presence of adequate carbon sources 
under heterotrophic growth conditions (Figure 7.14a). Paramylon has an unusual high crystallinity 
as natural macromolecule. Its high crystallinity is an advantage, in that paramylon granules can be 
isolated in a very low cost and efficient manner by simply disrupting the cells and purifying the 
granules by successive washing with a low concentration of detergent (Figure 7.14b and c). It can 
be easily solubilized in concentrated alkaline solution (Figure 7.14d). It consists of pure β-glucan, 
as shown in the NMR spectrum, which indicates that it consists of 100% glucose (Figure 7.14e). 
Paramylon crystallinity is due to higher-order aggregates of microfibrils, measuring 4–10 nm, 
composed of unbranched triple helices of β-(1,3)- d-glucan chains (Figure 7.14f). For these char -
acteristics, Euglena  could represent an alternative source of β-glucan to Saccharomyces cerevisiae  
(Baker’s yeast), which is currently exploited industrially for its extraction.

© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCParamylon was proved to potentiate the resistance of the brine shrimp Artemia  sp. to stress con -
ditions resulting from poor growth medium quality and daily handling, and to enhance reproductive 
success of the shrimps. Moreover, glucose-tolerant tests performed in diabetic mice 5 weeks after 
diabetes induction showed blood glucose concentration lower in animal fed with paramylon-added 
food with respect to control animals. Though the mechanisms by which β-glucan improves markers 
of glucose and insulin metabolism is poorly understood, the leading theory is that it increases the 
viscosity of the intestinal content, causing reduced postprandial insulin and glucose levels. Over 
time, lower ambient insulin level improves cellular insulin sensitivity, resulting in improved glucose 
metabolism. The effect of β-glucan to reduce blood glucose could also be mediated by delaying 
stomach emptying so that dietary glucose is absorbed more gradually. After ingestion of the glu -
cans, the peak of the blood glucose level is much smoothed and the shape of the plasma glucose 
response curve is much flatter. These changes reduce the feeling of hunger caused by rapid decrease 
in blood glucose. Thus, β-glucans may decrease appetite and reduce food intake.
β-glucan from Euglena  paramylon has successfully been used in aquaculture to strengthen the 
nonspecific defence of many important species of fishes and shrimps by injection, immersion, or 
in the feed. It acts as a nonspecific immune system stimulant, by binding to a specific receptor on 
monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes.
Other results have demonstrated that the oral administration of paramylon exhibits protective 
action on acute hepatic injury induced by CCl4 via an antioxidative mechanism and also inhibits the 
development of atopic dermatitis-like symptoms in mice, providing an effective alternative therapy to 
prednisolone. All these results support the potential use of paramylon in different fields of application.
Toxins
Toxins are all compounds that are either synthesized by the algae or formed by the composition of 
metabolic products and hence represent an intrinsic characteristic of the organism. Of the million 
species of microalgae, those that produce specific toxins scarcely exceed a hundred. These occur 
in both salt and freshwaters and while most are planktonics, some are benthic or floating at water 
surface. Toxins can attract particular attention when they cause the death of livestock that has drunk 
water containing them or fish and shellfish in the sea, or humans who consume them.
Algae which seem to be a direct producer of toxic substances mostly belong to three taxonomic 
groups: Cyanobacteria, Haptophyta, and Dynophyceae (Myzozoa). As well as these there are some 
groups which include one or two toxic members. Species of Chattonella  and Heterosygma , belong -
ing to the Raphidophyceae (Ochrophyta), form toxic red tides in Japanese waters and a few diatoms 
of the genus Peusdonitzschia  (Ochrophyta, Bacillariophyceae) produce domoic acid (DA), a low-
molecular amino acid causing amnesic shellfish poisoning.
Among the 50 freshwater existing cyanobacteria genera, 12 are capable of producing toxins. 
While blue-green algae have significant taste and odor constituents, representing a moldy smell, 
their toxic metabolites have no taste, odor, or color. The risk of exposure to algal toxins may come 
from drinking water, recreational water, dietary supplements, or residue on products irrigated with 
contaminated water and consumption of animal tissue. Avoiding cyanobacterial toxins is not as easy 
as avoiding a harmful algal bloom as toxins may be present in fish, shellfish, and water even after 
the bloom has dissipated. Cyanobacterial toxins are responsible for a variety of health effects such 
as skin irritations, respiratory ailments, neurological effects, and carcinogenic effects. The three 
major classes of these compounds are:
• Hepatotoxic cyclic peptides . The most frequently occurring and widespread are nodularins 
and microcystins. Nodularia , a well-known cyanobacterium, produces nodularins and is 
primarily a concern in marine and brackish waters, thus creating a risk to recreational 
swimmers. The 65 variants of microcystins, however, are isolated from freshwaters world -
wide and are produced by Microcystis  (the most commonly identified cyanobacteria in 302 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLChuman and animal poisonings), Anabaena , and other algae. They are very stable in the 
environment and resistant to heat, hydrolysis, and oxidation. Both toxins have an affinity 
for the liver. Other symptoms of exposure to microcystins may range from weakness, loss 
of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea to cancer.
• Neurotoxic alkaloids . These toxins are divided into two main classes, that is, anatoxins 
and saxitoxins, produced by the genera Anabaena , Planktothrix , and Aphanizomenon . 
Anatoxins may affect the nervous system, skin, liver, or gastrointestinal tract. These neu -
rotoxins can cause symptoms of diarrhea, shortness of breath, convulsions, and death, in 
high doses, due to respiratory failure. Saxitoxins are the cause of paralytic shellfish poison -
ings (PSPs) in humans consuming contaminated shellfish. There are no reports of similar 
poisonings via the drinking water route. Another alkaloid toxin is cylindrospermopsin 
produced by the filamentous cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii , Anabaena 
bergii , and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae .
• Endotoxic lipopolysaccharides . These compounds are common constituents of the outer 
cell walls of Cyanobacteria, similar to the cell-wall toxin found in Salmonella  bacteria, 
but less toxic.
The physicochemical nature of the water source can have an effect on not only the growth, but 
also the toxicity of the algal bloom. For example, some algae increase in toxicity when blooms are 
iron-deficient. In general, temperature, sunlight, and nutrient loads have a substantial impact on the 
proliferation of the bloom.
Haptophyta contain a few toxic species. One of them, Prymnesium parvum , produces a mix -
ture of toxins collectively named prymnesins, which exhibit potent cytotoxic, hemolytic, neu -
rotoxic, and ichthyotoxic effects. Another flagellate Chrysochromulina polylepis  produces and 
excretes two compounds, one hemolytic and one ichthyotoxic. The major hemolytic compound is 
a galactolipid, 1-acyl-3-digalacto-glycerol. These toxins cause osmoregulatory failure similar to 
that brought about by P. parvum.  Another widely distributed marine haptophyte Phaeocystis  sp. is 
familiar to fishermen in the form of extensive blooms of mucilaginous colonies which are avoided 
by herring. It produces large quantities of acrylic acid, which has strong bactericidal properties. 
Seventy years ago, Phaeocystis pouchetii  was suspected to cause avoidance of herring. Later, it 
was demonstrated that copepods avoided gracing on healthy P. pouchetii  colonies; food intake and 
growth were reduced in sea cage-cultivated salmon during the spring bloom of P. pouchetii , and 
water from P. pouchetii  cultures acted toxic toward cod larvae. Species belonging to the genus 
Phaeocystis  are important in all oceans, and P. pouchetii  is an important component of the spring 
bloom of phytoplankton in northern waters. Its life cycle is only partly resolved but is known to 
be polymorphic consisting of at least two solitary and one colonial stage. P. pouchetii  has been 
reported to produce a polyunsaturated aldehyde (PUA) as diatoms, namely the 2- trans -4-trans-
decadienal . This compound is known to interfere with the proliferation of different cell types, both 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic. As mechanical stress is known to induce the release of PUAs in other 
phytoplankton species, the release of 2- trans -4-trans -decadienal has been suggested to be a mean 
of deterring grazers, for example, zooplankton or fish larvae. P. pouchetii  is a common component 
of northern and temperate spring blooms, is grazed by zooplankton at normal rates, and can also 
be a diet preferable to diatoms. Copepods may avoid gracing on healthy colonies of P. pouchetii , 
thus, the production and excretion of PUAs seem to be depending on the state of the cells or on 
environmental factors, or both. It has been reported that this PUA can be released into the sea in 
the absence of grazers, indicating that it may serve as an allelochemical, that is, a compound that 
gives P. pouchetii  a competitive advantage over phytoplankton species blooming at the same time 
by inhibiting their growth.
Dynophyceae includes about a dozen genera, with at least 30 species, producing water and lipid-
soluble, low-molecular weight, neuroactive secondary metabolites that are among the most potent non -
proteinaceous poisons known. In general, these toxins have been shown to block the influx of sodium 303 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthrough excitable nerve membranes, thus preventing the formation of action potentials. The toxins are 
accumulated and sometimes metabolized by the shellfish that feed upon these dinoflagellates, causing 
different types of shellfish poisoning, such as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), diarrheic shellfish 
poisoning (DSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), and amnesic 
shellfish poisoning (ASP).
Ingestion of contaminated shellfish results in a wide variety of symptoms, depending on the 
toxin(s) present, their concentrations in the shellfish, and the amount of contaminated shellfish con -
sumed. In the case of PSP, caused by toxin of Alexandrium  spp., the effects are predominantly neu -
rological and include tingling, burning, numbness, drowsiness, incoherent speech, and respiratory 
paralysis. Less well characterized are the symptoms associated with DSP and NSP.
DSP is caused by okadaic acid (OA), a lyposoluble cyclic polyether with a carboxylic function. 
OA is a diarrhoeic shellfish toxin and tumor promoter found in many dinoflagellates of the genera 
Dinophysis  and in Prorocentrum lima . DSP is primarily observed as a generally mild gastroin -
testinal disorder, that is, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain accompanied by chills, 
headache, and fever.
Both gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms characterize NSP, including tingling and 
numbness of lips, tongue, and throat, muscular aches, dizziness, reversal of the sensations of hot and 
cold, diarrhoea, and vomiting. The NSP toxins are brevetoxins produced by Gymnodinium breve .
Another syndrome caused by dinoflagellate toxins is the CFP, connected with eating con -
taminated tropical reef fish. Ciguatoxins (CTXs) that cause CFP are actually produced by 
Gambierdiscus toxicus , a photosynthetic dinoflagellate that normally grows as an epiphyte and 
has a relatively slow growth rate of approximately one division every 3 days. In its coral reef 
habitat, G. toxicus  is biflagellate and swims if disturbed, but is usually motionless and attached 
to certain macroalgae. The dinoflagellate may also be associated with macroalgal detritus on the 
seafloor. Some scientists believe that the diverse symptoms of CFP are a result of a combination 
of several toxins and/or their metabolites, produced by one or more dinoflagellates. However, 
G. toxicus , which is found on a variety of macroalgae eaten by herbivorous fish, is now widely 
considered the single-celled source of CTXs and the potential cause of CFP. G. toxicus  produces 
two classes of polyether toxins, the CTXs and maitotoxins (MTXs). The CTXs are lipophilic and 
are accumulated in fish through food web transfer. More than 20 CTX congeners have been iso -
lated; however, only a few have been fully characterized structurally. The MTXs are transfused 
ladder-like polyether toxins, but are somewhat more polar, due to the presence of multiple sulfate 
groups. MTX was originally identified as a water-soluble toxin in the viscera of surgeon fish, and 
later found to be the principal toxin produced by G. toxicus . MTXs have not been demonstrated to 
bioaccumulate is fish tissues, possibly due to their more polar structure. Thus, if MTX is involved 
in CFP, it may be implicated only in CFPs derived from herbivorous fishes. The toxic potency 
of MTX exceeds that of CTX (respectively, 10 and 50 ng kg−1 in mice). Its mode of action has 
not been fully elucidated. Its biological activity is strictly calcium-dependent and causes both 
membrane depolarization and calcium influx in many different cell types. These toxins become 
progressively concentrated as they move up the food chain from small fish to large fish that eat 
them, and reach particularly high concentrations in large predatory tropical reef fish. Barracuda 
are commonly associated with CFP, but eating grouper, sea bass, snapper, mullet, and a number 
of other fish that live in oceans between latitude 35°N and 35°S has caused the disease. These 
fish are typically caught by sport fishermen on reefs in Hawaii, Guam and other South Pacific 
islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. CTX usually causes symptoms within a few minutes 
to 30 h after eating contaminated fish, and occasionally it may take up to 6 h. Common nonspe -
cific symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, excessive sweating, headache, and 
muscle aches. The sensation of burning or “pins-and-needles,” weakness, itching, and dizziness 
can occur. Patients may experience reversal of temperature sensation in their mouth (hot surfaces 
feeling cold and vice versa), unusual taste sensations, nightmares, or hallucinations. CFP is rarely 
fatal. Symptoms usually clear in 1–4 weeks.304 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCIn its typical form, CFP is characterized initially by the onset of intense vomiting, diarrhea, and 
abdominal pain within hours of ingestion of toxic fish. Within 12–14 h of onset, a prominent neuro -
logical disturbance develops, characterized by intense paraesthesia (tingling, crawling, or burning 
sensation of the skin) and dysanesthesia (painful sensation) in the arms, legs and perioral region, 
myalgia, muscle cramping, and weakness. During this stage of the illness, pruritus and sweating 
are commonly experienced.
Pseudonitzschia  spp. are among several other marine algae that can produce DA, the cause of 
ASP. DA was first isolated in Japan from the macroalgae species Chondria armata  in 1958 and was 
consequently called after the Japanese word for macroalgae, which is “domoi.” Its identification 
in 1987 as a neurotoxin was first treated with skepticism, because this water-soluble 3-carboxylic 
amino acid was known as a folk medicine in Japan to treat intestinal pinworm infestations when 
used in very small doses. Production of DA by algae seems to be a genetic property for a secondary 
metabolite with no known function in defense or primary metabolism.
DA can enter the marine food chain via uptake by shellfish such as mussels that filter their food 
out of the water. This water can contain both diatoms themselves and the toxin, which is released 
to the water column (although there is no evidence yet that the toxin can be taken up directly). The 
toxin accumulates in the digestive gland and certain tissues of shellfish, and it appears to have 
no effect on the animals. DA may be metabolized by bacteria (e.g., of the genera Alteromonas  
and Pseudomonas ) present in tissue of blue mussels ( Mytilus  edulis ). Scallops are reported not to 
contain these elimination bacteria. Anchovies can also contain DA in their guts, by feeding on 
toxic Pseudonitzschia  spp.; this toxin affects their behavior and survival. Effects are also seen 
in seals. In humans, consumption of contaminated seafood mostly affected the elderly or infirm. 
Heat does not destroy DA, although shellfish toxicity can decrease during cooking or freezing 
via DA transfer from the meats to the surrounding liquid. The sea otter is the only animal known 
to be able to avoid intoxication, probably recognizing toxic prey by their odor. The mechanism 
of DA toxicity is explained by its structural similarity with the excitatory neurotransmitter glu -
tamic acid and its analogs, but with a much stronger receptor affinity. DA is three times more 
potent than its analog kainic acid and up to 100 times more potent than glutamic acid itself. After 
exposure, DA binds predominately to N-methyl- d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the central 
nervous system, causing depolarization of the neurones. Subsequently, the intercellular calcium 
concentration increases, resulting in sustained activation of calcium-sensitive enzymes, eventu -
ally leading to depletion of energy, neuronal swelling, and cell death. The affected neurones 
are mainly located in the hippocampus, explaining the most striking effect of DA poisoning, 
which is short-term memory loss, observed in 25% of the affected persons in the 1987 contami -
nated mussel event. Other symptoms are confusion, nausea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, cramps, 
and diarrhea, all within 24 h. Neurological complaints, including ataxia, headache, disorienta -
tion, difficulty in breathing, and coma, develop 48 h after consumption. Permanent brain damage 
can also be caused by DA intoxication. Effects of chronic low-level ingestion are unknown. DA 
from mussels is more neurotoxic than the chemically pure compound. This increase is due to DA 
potentiation, caused by high concentrations of glutamic and aspartic acids present in mussel tis -
sue. This neurotoxic synergism occurs through a reduction in the voltage-dependent Mg2 block at 
the receptor-associated channel, following activation of non-NMDA receptors, in addition to the 
NMDA receptor activation by DA itself.
Intensive research over the last years has revealed a new class of phytotoxins produced by diatoms 
with more subtle and less specific effects, a discovery that has drawn a lot of attention since the dia -
toms have traditionally been regarded as a key component of the food chain. Three closely related 
PUAs have been isolated from Thalassiosira rotula , Skeletonema costatum , and Pseudonitzschia 
delicatissima , namely 2- trans -4-cis-7-cis-decatrienal, 2- trans -4-trans -7-cis-decatrienal, and 2- trans -
4-trans -decadienal. In the same study, these aldehydes were found to inhibit cleavage of sea urchin 
embryos and reduce growth of CaCO2 cells and hatching of copepod eggs. The structural element 
shared by these compounds, the unsaturated aldehyde group, is able to form adducts with nucleophiles 305 Algae Utilization
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCand is thus capable of inducing reactions that are toxic to the cell. The harmful effects of PUAs have 
been demonstrated at the organism level as inducers of apoptosis in sea urchin embryos, at the cell 
level as cytotoxicity in human cell lines, and at the protein level by deactivation of enzymes.
Table 7.4 summarizes toxic algae and the corresponding metabolite.

Oddities and Curiosities 
in the Algal World
The profound diversity of size, shape, habitat, metabolic traits, and growth strategies of algae makes 
this heterogeneous assemblage of prokaryotic and eukaryotic species an almost unlimited source of 
curious and unusual features.
The algal world is affected by both abiotic (physiochemical) and biotic factors. Abiotic factors 
are light, temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability, whereas biotic factors are, for example, 
competition within and between species for space, light, and nutrient or any limiting source, and 
associations/relations with other organisms.
Under the pressure of abiotic factors, algae display an incredible adaptability to most environ -
ments and provide an excellent system for testing hypotheses concerning the evolution of ecological 
tolerance. In fact, they are not limited to temperate waters, but can survive at very low depths and 
very low irradiances, and thrive beneath polar ice sheets. Upon adaptation to life on land, algae 
have colonized surprising places, such as catacombs, tree trunks, and hot springs, and can also resist 
desiccation in the desert regions of the world.
Algae also relate and interact with other organisms and face the problems connected to these 
interactions. A variety of relations exists, which includes epiphytism, parasitism, and symbiosis. 
Algae can share their life with animals, growing on sloth hair, inside the jelly capsule of amphib -
ian eggs, upon the carapaces of turtles or shells of mollusks, camouflaging the dorsal scute of 
harvestmen. They can also establish pathogenic association and cause infections in animals and 
humans.
The interactions between all these different factors can both hide and reveal odd traits and 
unusual characteristics of algae, providing a different perspective of discussion.
IN THE REALM OF DARKNESS
Among the factors that limit the rate of primary production through photosynthesis in aquatic sys -
tems (light, nutrients, CO, temperature), light is the one that shows the most extreme variation 
within the aquatic medium. Light decreases with depth down to levels that cannot support photo -
synthesis, with a marked change also in spectral distribution (refer to section “Light” in Chapter 3). 
Furthermore, to a much greater extent than the other limiting factors, light availability varies with 
time: both within the day—from darkness to the full noon sun—and as clouds pass across the sun, 
and with the seasons during the course of the year. Hence, low-light ecosystems are among the most 
challenging environments for photosynthetic organisms and relatively few algae thrive at the lower 
limits of the photic zone. Notwithstanding the constraints that restrict photosynthesis and growth 
at low photon flux density, deep-water algal populations are far more diverse and extensive than 
expected, and exploration associated to submersible collection of this diversity are continuously 
leading to an increase in the number of recorded species.
The depth receiving 1% of surface irradiance has typically been cited as the average compensa -
tion depth and the lower limit of the euphotic zone, but we will see that many are the deviations 
from this figure.8310 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCThe dependence of benthic primary production on irradiance can be defined by three distinct 
compensation irradiances (refer to Chapter 4):
• Ec phot, compensation irradiance for photosynthesis, the irradiance at which net photo -
synthesis is zero, that is, the rates of gross photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration are 
equal.
• Ec growth , compensation irradiance for growth, the irradiance at which gross primary pro -
duction balances the carbon losses (respiration, grazing, exudation of dissolved organic 
carbon, reproduction) for a particular organism.
• Ec comm , compensation irradiance for community metabolism, the irradiance at which 
gross community primary production balances the respiratory carbon loss for the entire 
community.
Ec phot is by far the most often reported measure of compensation irradiance and is an important 
physiological trait, but does not have a direct translation into the distribution and long-term produc -
tion of benthic organisms. It approximates Ec growth  only when measurements are obtained from 
individuals collected close to the depth limit of a particular species or acclimated at an irradiance 
close to that found at the depth limit. These conditions are not frequently met. Ec growth , for which 
there is a reasonable empirical basis, is the relevant parameter for estimating the areal extent of ben -
thic primary producers (the area receiving irradiances ≥ Ec growth ). Ec comm  represents the threshold 
irradiance above which benthic communities are autotrophic and can contribute to net production 
of organic carbon in coastal ecosystems.
Ec growth  and Ec comm  are the ecologically and biogeochemically relevant irradiance thresholds 
for benthic communities. These thresholds, respectively, delineate the deepest extent of benthic 
primary producers and the depth over which these communities act as sources of organic carbon to 
coastal ecosystems.
The maximum depth of distribution of primary producers, both microalgae (planktonic and 
benthic) and benthic macroalgae, which represents an estimate of Ec growth , ranges from 90 to 268 m 
corresponding to 11 to 0.0005% of incident surface radiation.
The first example of oceanic deep-water dwelling microalga is Prochlorococcus , a small (about 
0.7 μm) planktonic cyanobacterium recorded in the Arabian Sea, growing at a depth of 120–160 m, 
at photon fluxes averaging 0.04% of surface incident radiation. This microalga is adapted to this 
extremely low light largely through increased light absorption capabilities, that is, very high levels 
of accessory pigments per cell, namely chlorophyll b-related pigments, and high ratios of accessory 
pigments to chlorophyll a (high A480/A450 and A450/A680). It displays exceptional photosynthetic effi -
ciencies, averaging 0.107 mg C (mg chlorophyll a)−1 h−1 (μmol photons  m−2 s−1)−1, biomass-normal -
ized photosynthetic rates, PB, between 0.48 and 3.84 mg C (mg chlorophyll a)−1 h−1, and saturating 
irradiance, Ek, as low as 9.2 μmol m−2 s−1.
Much less is known about the ecological limits of benthic microalgae, in situ  light requirements 
or maximum depth of distribution. Limited field studies of benthic microalgae distributions and 
assessments of their photophysiology under low-light conditions suggest the potential for depth and 
light limits similar to those of phytoplankton and benthic macroalgae. Significant concentrations of 
chemically intact chlorophyll a have been reported from sediments in outer shelf and upper slope 
habitats in several locations globally and, offshore from North Carolina, to depths as great as 222 m, 
which could suggest the presence of benthic microalgae in this very low-light environment.
Recently, obligate benthic diatoms were discovered living on the upper continental slope off -
shore from North Carolina, in waters as deep as 191 m. A total of 126 species were identified from 
prepared samples, more than 90% of which are obligate benthic forms. Species of the epipsammic, 
monoraphid genus Cocconeis  were dominating in samples collected at bottom depths from 67 to 
191 m. This discovery substantially extends the known depth range of these primary producers and 
holds significant implications for oceanic productivity and biogeochemical cycling. Midday, near 311 Oddities and Curiosities in the Algal World
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCbottom, photosynthetically active radiation values recorded at the 191-m site averaged 0.106 μmol m−2 
s−1, representing about 0.028% of surface incident radiation and resulting from a water column atten -
uation coefficient of 0.0446 m−1 (refer to Equation 3.2). The presence of active benthic microalgae in 
these extremely low-light conditions suggests the development of special light-harvesting adaptations 
including elevated levels of the blue-light absorbing accessory pigment, fucoxanthin.
The maximum depth of macroalgae distribution is 268 m where dark-purple crustose coralline 
algae (Rhodophyta) grow on the primary basement substratum of San Salvador Island, Bahamas. 
Crustose corallines have adopted the ideal strategy for life in deep water; they can survive in spite 
of slow growth, they tolerate a wide range of nutrients, and they are well protected against grazing 
by herbivores. Their thallus structure represents a horizontal light receiver with no self-shading by a 
single cell layer which enhances light absorption. These algae have an increased content of accessory 
pigments, including carotenoids, xantophylls, and phycobiliproteins, which absorb light in spectral 
regions different from those of the green chlorophylls a and b, and channel it to chlorophyll a, which 
is the only molecule capable of converting sunlight energy into chemical energy. Moreover, they show 
an increased photosynthetic antenna size, which in turn increases the chance of photon absorption.
Depending on to the clarity of water and the annual sum of photosynthetic active radiation 
impinging at the water surface, the lower depth limit of crustose coralline algae shifts with lower 
latitude from several meters in cold temperate waters (e.g., 15 m on Helgoland Island, North Sea) 
to several hundred meters in tropical waters (e.g., 268 m Bahamas). The annual sum of impinging 
irradiance must support at least the annual need of energy for maintenance metabolism, measured 
by the maintenance respiration rate and guarantee a minimum of energy surplus for the establish -
ment of growth and reproduction. Compared to cold-temperate regions, Caribbean algae are able to 
survive in such extreme depths due to the higher solar irradiance, a 12-h period of daylight and the 
clear water conditions. For algae with a more complex, even erected thallus and the presence of non -
photosynthetic tissue as typically found in kelps, the need for light energy increases and the algae 
have to grow in more shallow waters as the amount of respiration and self-shading areas increases.
At the depth of crustose corallines, the red part of the sunlight spectrum is filtered out from 
the water, the faint residual light is blue-green, and its amount is approximately 0.0005% of the 
surface value. Considering that “full sun” (i.e., irradiance in the middle of the day) shines approxi -
mately 104 mol m−2 year  −1 on the earth surface, 0.0005% is equivalent to a photon flux of only 
5 mol m−2 year  −1 during full sunlight at its maximum zenith. At this low photon flux density, there 
are a number of constraints that restrict photosynthesis and growth in the form of energy-consum -
ing processes whose rates are invariant with photon flux density, and thus consume a large fraction 
of adsorbed photons at lower photon flux densities. Among these processes are the redox back 
reactions of reaction center II, the leakage of H+ through thylakoid membranes, and the turnover of 
photosynthetic proteins. The first process limits the rate of linear transport and ADP phosphoryla -
tion, whereas the second consumes ATP. These energy-consuming processes are sequential, so that 
their effects in constraining photosynthetic and growth rates are multiplicative. It is still difficult 
to explain how algae that can grow at less than 1 μmol m−2 s−1 cope with these energy-consuming 
reactions, which use an increasing fraction of the energy input as the photon flux density decreases.
Also green and brown algae occur in depths comparable with those of red algae. In San Salvador 
Island, Bahamas, above the depth of crustose coralline algae, around 210 m, trace amounts of the 
rock-boring green alga Ostreobium  sp. have been found, followed at 155 m by Rhipiliopsis pro -
funda , another green alga. In the same location, the brown alga Lobophora variegata  has been 
collected at 140 m, but many other ochrophytes and chlorophytes have been observed in different 
locations of coastal oceans between 100 and 157 m (Table 8.1).
Recently, particular attention has been paid to a group of little-known chlorophytes persisting 
in deep, low-light, benthic marine habitats, where grazing pressure and competition for space are 
highly reduced. This group forms the early diverging chlorophytic lineage of the Palmophyllales, 
which includes the three genera of Palmophyllum , Verdigellas , and Palmoclathrus. Verdigellas  has 
mostly been recorded at depths between 60 and 120 m, whereas Palmophyllum  and Palmoclathrus  312 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCspecies occur in shallower water, between 40 and 100 m. These algae are characterized by a 
unique type of multicellularity, forming firm, well-defined microscopic thalli composed of iso -
lated spherical cells morphologically and ultrastructurally identical in a gelatinous matrix (palm -
elloid organization). Several members have evolved relatively large, erect thalli with specialized 
gross morphological features. Individuals of the deep-water genus Verdigellas  attach to substrate 
by means of one or more distinct holdfast structures, from which thalli expand above, yielding an 
umbrella-like morphology well adapted to maximally capture the sparse light penetrating from the 
sea surface and reflected from the underlying substratum. Palmoclathrus , a genus from seasonally 
changing temperate waters, features a stout, perennial holdfast system consisting of a basal disk 
and one to several cylindrical stalks from which seasonal peltate blades grow. Palmophyllum  is 
morphologically simpler, forming irregular lobed crusts that are tightly attached to the substrate. TABLE 8.1

These algae lack the green light-harvesting photosynthetic pigments siphonoxanthin and siphonein 
typically found in other low-light adapted green algae, but adapt to low-light conditions by main -
taining high concentration of chlorophyll b, which absorbs the blue-green light of deeper water 
more efficiently than chlorophyll a.
The interest in the Palmophyllales is strictly connected to their deep-branching position, which 
raises questions about the nature of the green plant ancestor, generally accepted to be a unicellular 
flagellate. The molecular phylogenetic evidence that the nonflagellate Palmophyllales form a dis -
tinct and early diverging lineage of green algae indicates that the green plant ancestor could have 
been a nonmotile unicellular organism, maybe possessing transient motile stages.
A separate mention has to be reserved for other benthic primary producers, thriving at very 
dimly lit deep-water habitats, that is, corals, invertebrates in intimate endosymbiosis with photosyn -
thetic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium  (zooxanthellae). The deepest known hermatypic 
coral reefs are mainly located in Jamaica and Bahamas, at a depth of around 70 m. Recently, a deep-
water coral community has been discovered at Pulley Ridge off the southwest coast of Florida, in 
waters 58–75 m deep. At these depths, large areas with up to 60% live coral coverage are present; 
the zooxanthellate scleractinian coral Agaricia  sp. is one of the most abundant hermatypic corals 
in southern Pulley Ridge, forming tan-brown plates up to 50 cm in diameter. The corals generally 
appear to be healthy, with no obvious evidence of coral bleaching or disease, though they appear to 
be thriving on 1–2% (5–30 μmol m−2 s−1) of the available surface light (PAR) and about 5% of the 
light typically available to shallow-water reefs (500–1000 μmol m−2 s−1).
Besides zooxanthellate corals, the deepest portion of the photic zone also hosts antiphatarians, 
commonly known as black corals. These organisms have traditionally been considered an exclusive 
azooxanthellate order of anthozoan hexacorals, a trait thought to reflect their preference for low-
light environments that do not support photosynthesis. They occur in dimly lit to dark areas in both 
shallow water, where they are present in shaded microenvironments, and deep water, where they are 
effectively shaded by light intensities decreasing with depth. ITS2 genotyping and histology per -
formed on antiphatarian species collected from the Hawaian Islands and Johnston Atoll at depths 
between 10 and 396 m detected Symbiodinium  cells in all the samples collected down to below the 
compensation depth for photosynthesis in Hawaian waters (approx. 125 m). This study represents 
the deepest record for Symbiodinium , indicating that at least some members of this dinoflagellate 
genus have incredibly diverse habitat preferences and broad environmental ranges. Moreover, these 
findings suggest that the carbon demand of these dinoflagellate is either reduced by dormancy or 
met by means other than photosynthesis, such as by self-digestion or by heterothrophic feeding on 
an external carbon source. Heterotrophic endosymbiont feeding has been suggested in zooxanthel -
late invertebrates that are seasonally exposed to environmental conditions that do not support pho -
tosynthesis, and these modes of nutrition would make sense for Symbiodinium  populations located 
below the compensation depth for photosynthesis.
Low-light habitats are not limited to aquatic environments, but they are present also in subaerial 
locations, such as hypogea. The most comprehensive studies of subaerial biofilms have been carried 
out on the three catacomb sites dedicated to St. Domitilla, St. Callistus, and Priscilla in Rome, Italy, 
and on Maltese paleo-Christian catacombs situated in Rabat and Paola.
Micro-environmental parameters (light intensity/photoperiod, degree of wetness of the surface, 
relative humidity, temperature) determine which microorganisms prevail in a specific hypogeum, 
but the undisputed phototrophic protagonists in subaerial biofilms are filamentous cyanobacteria. 
Different species of terrestrial epilithic cyanobacteria belonging to the genera Eucapsis  Clements 
et Shantz 1909, Leptolyngbya  Anagnostidis et Komárek 1988 , Scytonema  Agardh ex Bornet et 
Flahault 1887, and Fischerella  lahault Gomont 1895 occur as dominant organisms in these photo -
trophic microbial communities.
Some of these taxa have never been recorded outside of these habitats and for this reason 
are defined as “troglobitic,” that is, obligate cavernicole taxa unable to survive outside of caves 314 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCor other low-light environments. Subaerophytic troglobitic cyanobacteria belonging to the genus 
Leptolyngbya  are particularly abundant in phototrophic biofilms present in both Roman and 
Maltese hypogea. These cyanobacteria live under extremely low photon fluxes, rarely exceeding 
10 μmol m−2 s−1, similar to deep-water algae. At this extremely low photon fluxes, these algae can 
grow because of the presence of phycobiliproteins organized in phycobilisomes in the thylakoid 
membranes inside the cell that transfer their absorbed extra energy to chlorophylls. They sense the 
light direction by means of a photoreceptive apparatus that is located in the apical portion of the tip 
cell, which is composed by a carotenoid-containing screening device and a light detector based on 
rhodopsin-like proteins (refer to Chapter 2).
ALGAE–ANIMAL INTERACTION: RIDING A SLOTH, SWINGING ON A SPIDER 
WEB, SWIMMING IN A JELLY . . .
Algae are involved into complex relationships with very different animals. They have been reported 
to grow epizoic on sloths, polar bears, seals, frogs and salamanders, arthropods, and turtles. In the 
following, we will describe the most unusual associations between these quite distant biological 
groups.
A very particular symbiosis is that between sloths and green algae. Sloths are slow-moving arbo -
rean mammals inhabiting tropical rainforest in Central and South America, represented by two 
genera, Bradypus , the three-toed sloths, and Chaelopus , the two-toed sloths. A versatile small-scale 
ecosystem that includes algae, ciliates, and fungi thrives in the sloth fur. The greenish color of the 
hair, especially evident in Bradypus  species, is due to green algae belonging to the algal classes 
Ulvophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae. These algae effectively turn these animals green, giving them 
excellent camouflage among the leaves. The camouflage is crucial to the sloth’s survival, because 
its inability to move quickly makes it an easy target for predators such as the harpy eagle ( Harpia 
harpyja ). Among the many odd features of these interesting animals, perhaps the oddest of all is 
their hair which, with its peculiar structure and its algal presence, is unlike the hair of any other 
mammal. Sloth hair is long and coarse and that of the two living species belonging to the genus 
Chaelopus  is unique in having a number of deep groves running the length of each hair, whereas the 
hair of the four species belonging to genus Bradypus  has irregular transverse cracks that increase 
in number and size with age. During the dry season, the hair of sloths usually has a dirty brown 
coloration, but during a long period of rain it may show very appreciable greenish tinges brought 
about by the increased presence of symbiotic algae.
Recently, the genetic diversity of the eukaryotic community present in the fur of sloths belonging 
to all six extant species was investigated. The majority of the green algal sequences obtained from 
the hair samples formed a clade of their own within the green algal class Ulvophyceae (Chlorophyta). 
This group received high support (100%) for its monophyly in all phylogenetic analyses that were 
employed. This clade, consisting of small (3–13 μm) thick-walled cells without pyrenoids, is likely 
to correspond to the green algal genus Trichophilus , whose first description dates back to 1887. The 
clade was subdivided into three subclades that received moderate-to-high internal node support. Two 
subclades, A and C, were formed by rRNA gene clones originating from Choloepus hoffmanni  hair 
samples. Clones in the clade B originated from the hair of Bradypus  species. Within clade B, the 
sequences from Bradypus tridactylus  were different from those of B. variegatus  and B. pygmaeus .
Trichophilus  spp. was the only green alga in the hair of the brown-throated sloth B. variegatus  
and the pygmy three-toed sloth B. pygmaeus . These species were also found on Hoffmann’s two-
toed sloth C. hoffmanni  and the pale-throated sloth B. tridactylus , together with terrestrial green 
algae from their surroundings, such as Trentepohlia  (Ulvophyceae, Chlorophyta) and Myrmecia  
(Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta), while the maned three-toed sloth B. torquatus  hosted a variety 
of purely terrestrial algae.
The algae have a distinct distribution patterns in Choloepus  and Bradypus , lying longitudinally 
along the grooves in the former and in short lateral tongue or lines in the latter. The algae found on the 315 Oddities and Curiosities in the Algal World
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCcoat of B. tridactylus  lie between the cuticle scales and the hair changes with age in apparently all spe -
cies of Bradypus . Young hairs are white, gray, brownish, or black and do not possess the deep cracks 
seen in older hairs. The first traces of algae appear on these young hairs as tiny dots or extremely 
narrow transverse lines. Older hairs have larger, wider algal colonies and obvious deep transverse 
cracks. When wet, these cracks close considerably, but when dry give the effects of beads on a string. 
The oldest hairs are badly deteriorated with the spongy cuticle worn off on one side exposing the full 
length of the cortex. In the older hairs, living algae are absent. It was suggested that either the algae 
colonize the very narrow cracks in young hairs or the algae themselves initiate the cracks. The hair of 
all the three Bradypus  species readily absorbs water, but those of Choloepus  do not.
No evidence of algae were found in babies still at the age of clinging to their mothers, suggesting 
that at least Trichophilus  is gained in childhood, most likely from the mother. This observation is 
supported by an earlier study noting that sloths gain the algae and other parasites by the time they 
are a few weeks old, which could provide them a protective camouflage.
Lack of healthy algal colonies has been observed in Bradypus  kept in captivity; since they do not 
survive long under these conditions, algae have been suggested to provide nutrition or a particular 
trace element essential for the health of the animals.
Algae have reported to grow also on the fur of polar bears ( Thalarctos maritimus ). These ani -
mals normally have creamy-white fur, presumably an adaptation for camouflage in a snowy envi -
ronment. However, cases are being reported of polar bears kept in captivity in different American 
and Japanese zoos, which turned green as a result of algae growing on their fur. The coloration was 
particularly evident on the flanks, on the outer fur of the legs, and in a band across the rump. This 
coloration was clearly attributable to the presence of algae inside the hairs, specifically in the hol -
low medullae of many of the wider (50–200 μm), stiffer guard hairs of the outer coat. The thinner 
(<20 μm) hairs of the undercoat, which were not hollow, were colorless. The fact that some of these 
lumina were in connection with the external air or water could explain how the algal cells could 
have entered the hairs in the first place, and how exchange of O2 and CO2 and uptake of water and 
mineral salts would be facilitated and could permit growth of the algae if suitably illuminated. Such 
a habitat has certain advantages, being warm and protected from most kind of potential predators. 
The algae isolated from the polar bear hairs and cultured under controlled conditions were identi -
fied as cyanobacteria.
Algal occurrence on turtle carapacians is another common associative phenomenon often 
reported in literature. The green algal genus Basicladia  Hoffman and Tilden (Ulvophyceae, 
Chlorophyta) contains species, which are specifically epizoic on carapaces of turtles or shells of 
mollusks. Closely related to the genus Cladophora , the genus Basicladia  is mainly distinguished 
by its epizoic nature. Five species are recognized and all are known only from freshwater turtles 
or snails. Basicladia crassa  and B. chelonum  have been reported from freshwater turtles in several 
states of the Rocky Mountains and the Caribbean. Outside the USA, B. sinensis  was described 
from the back of a turtle brought from China to an aquarium in California, and B. ramulosa , an 
exceptionally large species, is known from Australian turtles. The fifth taxon, B. vivipara  is known 
only from the freshwater snail, Viviparus malleatus  Reeve. In 1975, B. crassa  was reported for the 
first time from Virginia on the carapace of a red-bellied turtle Chrysemis rubriventris . The algae 
are characterized by a thallus with siphonocladous organization, with single, unbranched, some -
times twisted filaments. Rhizoids at the basal part are usually round and they attach to the turtle 
shell. These algae are usually restricted to the turtle carapace, where they form a wide band thickly 
covering the marginals and ventral half of the pleural scutes, but thinning as it extended dorsally. 
The rugose carapacial surface of this turtle is well suited for the attachment of algal rhizoids, but 
the basking habit of the turtle may account for the absence of most carapacial algae since they are 
subject to increased desiccation and solar radiation above the water level. Also C. rubiventris  sheds 
the epidermal scutes of its carapace periodically, thus freeing itself of any algae attached. However, 
it is not uncommon to find “moss-back” red-bellies in the spring, especially just after emergence 
from hibernation when air temperature is still too cool for much basking. B. crassa  and B. chelonum  316 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCare able to survive periods of basking desiccation and even more heat than the turtles themselves. 
It is possible that repeated exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays and the drying effect through 
frequent basking associated with the grazing action of herbivorous fish or amphipods would at least 
limit the growth of these algae.
Another mutualistic association with algae occurs in some amphibians. All amphibians lay 
eggs with a capsule, although the form and thickness of the capsule vary widely. Some amphib -
ians, including the spotted salamander Ambystoma maculatum  and the pickerel frog Rana palus -
tris, embed their eggs in large masses of relatively firm jelly, which are attached to vegetation 
in ponds. Other amphibians, including the wood frog Rana sylvatica  and the spotted marsh frog 
Lymnodynastes tasmaniensis , lay their eggs in masses that float at the surface of the pond or are 
loosely attached to vegetation. The capsule, at least in aquatically developing amphibians, protects 
the eggs from predators and it also resists exchange of respiratory gases. Amphibian egg masses in 
the wild are often inhabited by algae, as, for example, egg masses of A. maculatum . The algae were 
first noted by Orr in 1888, who speculated that they must have considerable influence on the respira -
tion of the embryos. It is now well established that this relationship is symbiotic. The alga Oophila 
ambystomatis  (Chlorophyceae, Chlorophyta) is found exclusively in amphibian egg masses, mostly 
in those of A. maculatum  (it derives its name from this association), but also in those of R. sylvatica  
and some other species.
Individual egg capsules appear green due to dense accumulations of algae surrounding the 
embryo. In A. maculatum , algae primarily enter salamander embryos through the blastopore before 
the formation of a patent stomodeum and therefore before active feeding is possible. The embryonic 
association of the Ambystoma –alga symbiosis may indicate an inefficient immune system or an 
adaptive immune response that would otherwise remove invading intracellular algae. Some algal 
cells are also embedded within epithelial or mesenchymal tissues that are far from the alimen -
tary canal, consistent with algae having entered salamander embryos directly by penetrating their 
embryonic integument. Molecular data are consistent with a process of oviductal transmission of 
algae from one salamander generation to the other, but horizontal transmission could be present as 
well, with the algae deriving from the environment. Algal cells leave direct sunlight by entering 
opaque salamander tissues. Behavioral stimuli, such as gradients of nitrogenous waste, which may 
instigate algal proliferation, could serve as the behavioral cue for tissue and cellular invasion against 
this light gradient.
The mutual benefit of this facultative association has been clearly established through exclusion 
experiments. Clutches raised in the dark do not accrue detectable algae. The presence of algae in 
these experiments correlates with earlier hatching, decreased embryonic mortality, more synchro -
nous hatching, and reaching a larger size, and later developmental stage at hatching. Additionally, 
algal growth is minimal in egg capsules after embryos are removed, indicating that the embryos, 
and not the egg capsules, aid algal growth. Intracapsular algae are thought to benefit from nitrog -
enous wastes released by the embryos, whereas salamander embryos benefit from the net increase 
of oxygen produced by the algae. Most intracellular algae, and algae of the alimentary canal, dis -
appear by early larval stages. Their possible absorption may confer a further metabolic benefit to 
their host. Presence of algae also correlates with decreased cilium-mediated rotation of early-stage 
embryos and increased muscular contractions during later embryonic stages, both of which may 
be secondary effects of modulated oxygen levels. The reciprocal benefits of hatchling survival 
and growth to the embryo, and population growth to the algae, reveal that this symbiosis is a true 
mutualism.
Algae are also important for tadpoles of other amphibians, establishing an ecologically impor -
tant mutualism that is conditional and provides partner species with novel options for adjusting to 
a changing environment. It is well known that organisms reaching their critical thermal maximum 
(CTM; the minimal high deep-body temperature that is lethal to an animal) are incapable of escaping 
the lethal conditions. This holds especially true for aquatic organisms in thermally uniform systems, 
which have no refuge from heat stress; further, temperature increases within such systems decrease 317 Oddities and Curiosities in the Algal World
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthe concentration of the necessary oxygen and carbon dioxide gases. Aquatic organisms that are 
stressed for these gases for respiration and photosynthesis would benefit from fortuitous mutualistic 
interactions in which the “by-product” gases evolved by metabolism can be absorbed reciprocally. 
Observations were conducted on numerous tadpoles of the dwarf American toad, Bufo americanus 
charlesmithi  in a shallow temporary pool subjected to extended exposure to solar radiation, located 
in Ashley County (Arkansas, USA). The water became very warm by mid-afternoon, and some of 
the tadpoles possessed an atypical greenish color. The tadpoles were late stage, and some of them 
exhibited well-developed legs. Microscopic examination of live tadpoles from the pool revealed clus -
ter of biflagellated green algae identified as Chlorogonium  (Chlorophyceae, Chlorophyta) scattered 
as greenish blotches over the skin. Individuals of this alga were observed actively flagellating to 
maintain a position oriented to the skin of the tadpole. The distribution of the alga generally followed 
the pattern of cutaneous blood vessels on the dorsal surfaces of the legs, tail, and lateral body wall.
The high CTM of toads help them survive in warmer conditions and shortens the time required 
for development, thereby promoting metamorphosis prior to desiccation of the habitat. Rates of 
oxygen consumption in tadpoles increase with higher temperatures, but water at higher tempera -
ture holds a lower concentration of gases. Although tadpoles are tolerant of warmer temperatures, 
the O2 deficits can lead to respiratory distress and death. Under conditions of low O2, tadpoles of 
some species can supplement oxygen intake by gulping air, but the late development of the lungs 
precludes this in Bufo. Consumption of O2 increases sharply prior to metamorphosis. Thus, the 
warmer water contains less O2 at a time when more may be needed. Even after acclimatization 
to warmer temperatures, the CTM of tadpoles of most anuran species is 38–40°C, with a few 
exceptions above 41°C in species that develop in xeric (with very little moisture) or tropical habi -
tats. On the other hand, the rate of photosynthesis tends to increase with increases in temperature 
up to an optimum, after which it decreases rapidly, partly limited by the availability of inorganic 
carbon. Growth rate of algae slows in stagnant cultures because the rate of diffusion of CO2 from 
the air becomes limiting, partly because CO2 diffuses 104 times faster in air than in water. Green 
algae (Chlorophyta, including Chlorogonium ) tend to dominate in temperatures of 15–30°C, but are 
replaced by cyanobacteria above 30°C. Thermophilic algae thrive best in waters rich in CO2, where 
conditions necessary to maintain high rates of photosynthesis are met. The pattern of association 
and distribution of Chlorogonium  over the skin of tadpoles allows maximum potential for uptake 
of otherwise limiting CO2 released via cutaneous respiration by tadpoles. The relatively small size 
of Chlorogonium  specimens also could indicate stress. The mean length of the cells taken from the 
tadpoles was 13.4 μm (range 7–22 μm), and width ranged only between 1.5 and 3 μm. The normal 
measurements from species known to occur in the USA ranges from 19 to 59 μm in length and 5 to 
18 μm in width. Smaller cells result in a higher surface-to-volume ratio, which could help maximize 
absorption in a CO2-limited environment.
The CTM at which tadpoles of Bufo americanus  could survive independently is 39.5°C. In a 
heat-stress-inducing environment, however, the CTM could be expanded by over 4°C (to about 
43°C) in the presence of a photosynthetic, mutualistic alga such as Chlorogonium . Considering 
these phenomena, it is hypothesized that the Chlorogonium  and tadpoles are exhibiting a faculta -
tive symbiosis in which tadpoles gain O2 produced via photosynthesis adjacent to the skin, and 
concomitantly Chlorogonium  received the metabolic CO2 evolved from the tadpoles. Similar algal 
accumulations have been found on tadpoles of gray tree frogs ( Hyla versicolor ) and cricket frog 
(Acris crepitans ) at other locations within Arkansas, USA.
Arthropods are also good hosts for algae. Cyanobacteria were reported to grow epizoically on 
the dorsal scute of the harvestman Neosadocus  sp. (Arachnida, Opiliones), on Cardoso Island, 
southeast Brazil. The epizoic algae almost fully covered the harvestmen’s back, giving the animals 
a greenish coloration contrasting markedly with the brownish body and appendages. The growth of 
the algae did not affect behavior and locomotion of the animals, which would benefit from the pres -
ence of the photosynthetic organism by being camouflaged and thus protected from visual diurnal 
predators.318 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCArachnids are also exploited by green algae. Very recently, a species of the well-known genus of 
green unicellular alga Dunaliella  (Chlorophyceae, Chlorophyta) was found on the walls of a cave 
located in the Coastal Range hills of the Atacama Desert (Chile). The cave, situated about 75 m 
above sea level, is about 170-m deep, with an average height of 50 m, and its entrance directly con -
fronts the Pacific Ocean, less than 200 m away from it. The alga grows upon spider webs attached 
to the walls of the entrance-twilight transition zone of the cave. All previously reported members of 
this genus are found in extremely saline aquatic environments, and hence this is the first Dunaliella  
species able to thrive in a subaerial habitat. The identity of this alga as a new species, Dunaliella 
atacamensis , was assessed by molecular and morphological methods.
The Coastal Range, which separates the hyperarid Atacama Desert plateau from the Pacific 
Ocean, acts as a topographic barrier to clouds and moisture-rich marine air moving from the ocean. 
Thus, fog-originated water allows the presence of “fog oases” in this region, with a daily cycle with 
a maximum expansion over the coastal hills during the night and early morning hours. The cave 
interior acts like a funnel that continuously captures the incoming water-rich air of oceanic origin, 
in particular, the south-facing walls exposed to the moisture-rich prevailing winds, the only area 
of the cave where the alga grows. This area is about 20 m away from the entrance, where the light 
is about 1.4% of the outside incident light. The alga grows mostly as colonies of green cells cover -
ing spider webs attached to the cave walls and not on the underlying rocks. The colonized spider 
webs are constantly subjected to the flow of the humid-rich air moving through them, condensing 
water droplets especially during the night and early morning hours. Condensation of water onto the 
hygroscopic threads of spider webs is a well-known phenomenon. An alternative source of water 
could be dew, whose formation is induced by substrates with temperatures below the dew point of 
the ambient air. As the exposed surfaces of the cave cool by radiating heat during the late afternoon 
and night, atmospheric moisture could condense at a rate greater than that at which it can evaporate, 
resulting in the formation of water droplets on the spider-web threads at the early hours of the morn -
ing as observed.
D. atacamensis  cells are nonmotile, mostly round or ovoid, with a diameter of 6 μm; they pos -
sess one cup-shaped chloroplast with a single pyrenoid surrounded by several starch bodies. Though 
no flagellum appears to be present, the cells possess small stub-like structures reminiscent of fla -
gella. These stub-like structures are comparable to the short flagella previously described in a D. 
salina  mutant and could have the function of primary “clinging” devices attaching the cell to the 
spider-web thread.
The cells form tetrads which join into colony-like structures in irregular clumps reminiscent of 
palmelloid stages of other Dunaliella  species under reduced salinity conditions ( ≤10% NaCl). In the 
palmella stage, the cells usually lose their flagella and eyespot, become more rounded and excrete a 
layer of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) in which they repeatedly divide, thus forming colonies of green 
cells. All these morphological characteristics are present in D. atacamensis  cells.
Another interesting feature is the well-developed layer of EPSs, which in D. salina  strains are 
produced in response to the environmental stress caused by increasing salt concentrations. EPSs 
have been shown to be involved in the efficient capture and retention of ambient water by cyano -
bacteria in extreme environments, suggesting a similar role for the cave inhabiting D. atacamensis . 
Since the thick layer of EPSs could lower CO2 diffusion in the cells, a pyrenoid might be advanta -
geous in a subaerial habitat for carbon fixation in this extreme environment.
Different features previously evolved by Dunaliella  species for living in hypersaline environ -
ments (i.e., colonial growth, pigments for avoiding photodamage, salt tolerance, glycerol produc -
tion, EPS production) result highly advantageous for adapting to a subaerial environment with 
reduced water availability and perhaps different light regimes than those experienced by its aquatic 
ancestors. This process recapitulates the adaptations evolved by green algae for the sea-to-land 
transition, that is, from aquatic algae to land plants. As algae moved to land, they could make an 
efficient use of resources by exploiting a range of previously evolved traits that are likely to have 
played a key role in this successful process of extending the habitability range. These include 319 Oddities and Curiosities in the Algal World
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCcell-wall biochemistry, desiccation resistance and tolerance, structural complexity, as well as 
 various reproductive  strategies. Many of these traits characterize the enormous physiological vari -
ability of Dunaliella  species, and D. atacamensis  represents a beautiful example of this assertion.
Algae can also establish pathogenic association with both animals and humans. Among the gen -
era most intensely investigated are Prototheca , which infect only vertebrates, and Helicosporidium  
(Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta), which are known so far to invade only invertebrates.
Algae of the genus Prototheca  are achlorophyllic unicells, spherical to oval in shape, rang -
ing from 3 to 30 μm in diameter. Phylogenetic studies indicate that Prototheca  spp. cluster with 
the photosynthetic alga Auxenochlorella protothecoide  (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta), and 
Helicosporidium.  Therefore, protothecal species are closely related to the green algae Chlorella  
(Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) but lack chloroplasts and possess a two-layered, instead of three-
layered, cell wall; they are heterotrophic and require an external source of organic carbon and 
nitrogen. The life cycle is similar to that of algae of the genus Chlorella ; reproduction is asexual by 
internal septation and irregular cleavage, with subsequent rupture and release of 2-to-16 autospores 
through a characteristic split in the cell wall of the parent cell. Released autospores then go on to 
develop into mature cells. The taxonomic status of the genus Prototheca  has changed during the last 
decades and currently the following five species are assigned to this genus: P. zopfii , P. wickerhamii , 
P. stagnora , P. ulmea , and P. blaschkeae . A sixth species, P. moriformis , is not generally accepted. 
Only two of these species have been documented to cause infections in humans and animals, that 
is, P. zopfii  and P. wickerhamii .
These algae are globally ubiquitous and can be isolated from various reservoirs, such as environ -
ment, animals, and food. Typical sources of Prototheca  species are the slime flux of trees, fresh and 
marine waters, soil and sewage, stables and animal buildings, excrement, various animals (cattle, 
deer, dogs), and food items such as butter, potato peels, bananas, and cow milk.
In 1952, P. zopfii  was first identified as a pathogen of bovine mastitis associated with reduced 
milk production characterized by thin watery secretion with white flakes. This form of mastitis 
now occurs endemic in the most countries of the world and represents a serious problem since the 
affected animals must be culled from their herds to halt transmission of the disease.
Prototheca  produce disease also in humans, and the clinical conditions caused by this alga are 
generally referred to as protothecosis. The first case of human infection was diagnosed in 1961 in 
Sierra Leone on a rice farmer; it took the form of a verrucose foot lesion from which P. zopfii  was 
isolated as an etiological agent. Over the following years, the number of documented cases of pro -
tothecosis rose continuously, with about four new cases being diagnosed every year over the past 
decade.
Only a few cases of systemic disease have been reported. Most infections are likely due to trau -
matic implantation of organisms, but a few cases of opportunistic infection have also been reported. 
Protothecosis has also been diagnosed among other very different species such as dogs, cats, sheep, 
deer, Atlantic salmon, carp, and flying foxes.
Despite its nonphotosynthetic, obligate heterotrophic nature, Prototheca  is known to have 
retained a plastid with starch granules; recent data indicate that several metabolic pathways (e.g., 
carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, and isoprenoid) are located in this nonphotosynthetic plastid. The 
reconstruction of this complex metabolic network could represent a new approach in the treatment 
of protothecosis.
Algae of the genus Helicosporidium  are obligate parasites of invertebrates, especially arthropods 
(insects, mites, crustaceans, and trematodes), which support the growth and development of the 
parasite in their hemolymph. This alga features three different life stages: cysts, filamentous cells, 
and vegetative cells. The life cycle begins with an orally transmitted cyst stage that is comprised of 
three ovoid cells and a coiled, elongate filamentous cell enclosed within an outer pellicle. Within 
the gut of the host, cysts burst, open, and release a filamentous cell with surface barbs along with 
three egg-shaped accessory cells. The barbed filaments proceed to invade the gut cells, penetrating 
them and emerging into the hemolymph. Vegetative cells have been observed to replicate within 320 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthe phagocytic hemocytes and to develop extracellularly in the hemolymph. After multiple 2–4 cell 
autosporogenic cell divisions, a portion of the hemolymph-borne vegetative cells differentiate into 
cysts. Generally, the infection leads to the death of the host, but the exact mode of transmission 
remains poorly known.
Also Helicosporidia contain plastids, and although they have not yet been visually identified, 
molecular evidence has confirmed their existence. The Helicosporidium  plastid genome is one of 
the smallest known (37.5 kb). Its reduced size results from loss of many genes commonly found in 
plastids of other plants and algae (including all proteins that function in photosynthesis), elimination 
of duplicated genes and redundant tRNA isoacceptors, and minimization of intergenic spaces. The 
Helicosporidium  plastid genome is also highly structured, with each half of the circular genome 
containing nearly all genes on one strand. Both the structure and content of the plastid genome and 
the deduced function of the organelle show parallels with the relict plastid found in the apicom -
plexan malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum .
The apicomplexa and Helicosporidium  are not closely related; indeed, among plastid types, 
they could hardly be more different: the apicoplast is a secondary plastid derived from a red alga, 
whereas the Helicosporidium  plastid is a primary green algal plastid. The cryptic Helicosporidium  
plastid is probably also metabolically more diverse and retains several pathways that have been 
lost by Plasmodium , such as amino acid metabolic pathways. A possible explanation is that 
Helicosporidium  can survive in a cyst form outside its host and thus might need more metabolic 
autonomy than Plasmodium , which is entirely host associated throughout its life cycle.
These unrelated organisms each evolved from photosynthetic ancestors, and the convergence in 
form and function of their relict plastids suggest that common forces shape plastid evolution, fol -
lowing the switch from autotrophy to parasitism. If plastid reduction is a continuous process, then 
Plasmodium  may simply be further along in the process of reducing a full functioning plastid to the 
highly specialized relict we see today.
SOME LIKE IT COLD . . .
Other unusual and extreme habitats for algae are represented by very cold environments, such as 
platelet ice layer, the snowfield, and the glaciers. Algal cells adapting to cold temperatures have to 
take care of the following three processes:
• Changing the ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the lipids of the cell mem -
branes to maintain membrane fluidity
• Adjusting the permeability of the cell membrane for water to react to osmotic changes of 
the outer medium
• When exposed to freezing temperatures, reducing the water content of the cell interior to 
prevent ice crystal formation
Adaptive features include pigments, polyols (sugar alcohols, e.g., glycerin), sugars and lipids 
(oils), mucilage sheaths, motile stages, and spore formation. Moreover, since the algae living in 
regions that receive full solar exposure are adapted to high UV light environment, they can augment 
their UV protection capacity especially during summer months by producing secondary metabo -
lites including phenylpropanoids, carotenoids, xanthophylls, and mycosporine amino acids.
In some Antarctic coastal areas, a semi-consolidated layer of platelet ice (flat, disk-shaped ice 
crystals mixed with seawater, approximately 20% ice and 80% seawater by volume, approximately 
0.1 m in diameter and 10 mm in thickness), ranging from a few centimeters to several meters in 
thickness, occurs under sea ice located adjacent to floating ice shelves. The platelet ice is intermedi -
ate between the relatively impermeable congelation ice above and the water column below and it is 
characterized by quite rapid nutrient exchanges. Because it is submerged beneath 1–2 m of consoli -
dated ice, irradiance reaching the platelet ice is first attenuated by the overlying snow cover, sea ice 321 Oddities and Curiosities in the Algal World
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCcrystals and brine inclusions, particles, and soluble material, resulting in a light field that is reduced 
in magnitude and restricted in spectral distribution. Nevertheless, reports of high algal production 
and biomass accumulation in the platelet ice of the Weddell and Ross Seas (Antarctica) attest to the 
success of the platelet ice microalgal community at growth in these low light conditions. The algae 
inhabiting the platelet ice layer are extremely shade adapted, typically attaining maximum photo -
synthetic rates at an irradiance of ≤20 μmol m−2 s−1.
Platelet ice provides a much larger surface area for algal attachment and growth than the skeletal 
layer where most of the biomass within the congelation ice is concentrated. For example, a 0.02-m 
thick skeletal layer with ice crystals spaced 0.6 mm apart provides approximately 67 m2 of surface 
area per m2 of horizontal surface, with relatively little interstitial space for seawater exchange. In 
contrast, a platelet layer 0.6–0.7-m thick would have a surface area of approximately 400 m2 per m2 
of horizontal surface, with a large amount of interstitial space.
In addition, the fixed position of the platelets provides a stable substrate that isolates the algae 
from vertical mixing and holds them in a higher and less variable light field than that available 
within the underlying water column. Vertical compression of the biomass also reduces the fraction 
of PAR absorbed by the ice/water milieu of the platelet layer and increases the fraction absorbed 
by the algae for use in photosynthesis. Ice microbial communities are dominated by microalgae, 
primarily diatom species, such as Nitzschia stellata , Pinnularia quadreata , Fragilariopsis sublin -
eata, and Melosira arctica  (Bacyllariophyceae, Ochrophyta) . The latter diatom has extensively been 
studied for the effect that its abundant secretion of mucus-like EPSs might have on sea ice formation 
and durability. M. arctica , together with other unicellular algae, small crustaceans, and bacteria, 
inhabits the brine channels present in the platelet ice, in which the brine expelled from the ice crys -
tals remains trapped. The particularly potent exopolymers of M. arctica  lead to more disordered 
ice crystals, greater pore density, more complex pore geometries, and greater salt retention by the 
newly formed ice. Exopolymer-enhanced retention of salt in growing sea ice translates to greater 
retention of other source water impurities, including EPS-producing microalgae. The benefits of ice 
entrainment to algae include stable positioning to capture more light energy for photosynthesis and 
refuge from predation. By altering ice physical properties, EPSs precondition the bottom ice layer 
for optimal habitability, as well as for later survival as the growing ice front becomes colder interior 
ice with smaller pores of more concentrated brine and biologically protective EPSs. The survival 
benefits extend to Bacteria and Archaea ubiquitous in cold winter ice. For filamentous ice algae that 
cross the ice–water interface, accessing nutrients in underlying waters, the EPS-mediated geometric 
complexities of the ice pore space may help anchor filaments.
Sea ice that retains more salt will also retain more of the dissolved constituents of the source 
water, from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to iron and other nutrients essential to pri -
mary production. Their retention, alteration, and eventual release determine the biogeochemical 
imprint of sea ice on the surface ocean (and atmosphere). The reduction of ice permeability by EPSs 
must also influence the role of sea ice as an inorganic carbon pump from atmosphere to underlying 
ocean, as well as its seeding and fertilization of surface waters during the melt season.
True snow algae are defined as those that grow and reproduce wholly within the water retained 
by snow during snowmelt. During summer months, large blooms occur, which can reach cell con -
centration of 106 cells mL−1 and color whole snow banks red, orange, green, or gray depending on 
the species and habitat conditions. Most snow algae belong to Chlorophyta, such as Chloromonas 
rubroleosa  (Chlorophyceae) and Chlamydomonas nivalis  (Chlorophyceae). These algae color the 
snow red, due to the excess of carotenoids and xantophylls. Species from other algal groups are also 
important, and the dominant alga in many of the glaciers around the world is the saccoderm desmid 
Mesotaenium berggrenii  (Conjugatophyceae, Chlorophyta), an alga that colors the snow grey, due 
to its iron tannin compounds.
Snow algae go through a complex life history, involving motile vegetative stages that undergo 
syngamy and thick-walled resting spores and zygotes. The latter allow them to survive the time 
when the snow has completely melted, and probably to be spread by wind. Many of these algae 322 Algae
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCpossess vegetative and/or motile cells that are usually green in color and immotile spores or cysts 
that may be red, orange, or yellowish-green in color. The green vegetative cells color the snow 
green, whereas the red and orange snow are generally caused by the spore stages though some snow 
algae may be red-pigmented in their vegetative state. The spores usually have thick walls and large 
amounts of lipid reserves, polyols, and sugars. They are able to withstand subzero temperatures in 
winter and also high soil temperatures and desiccation in summer, which would kill normal veg -
etative cells. The motile stages enable them to recolonize the snow from germinating spores left 
behind on the soil as well as to position themselves at the optimum depth for photosynthesis in the 
snow/ice column. The cells of some species also secrete copious amounts of mucilage which enable 
them to adhere to one another and to snow crystals and prevent the cells from being washed away 
by melt water. The mucilage also forms a protective coat and delays desiccation, and it may have an 
additional function as a UV shield. A few species are common worldwide, but others are restricted 
to either the Northern or Southern hemispheres.
Snow algae sustain a highly diverse microbial community on snowfields and glaciers, which is 
composed of bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates, and ciliates. These organisms in turn sustain a com -
munity of cold-adapted animal species, such as midges, copepods, and snow fleas on Himalayan 
glaciers, and ice worms and collembolas on North American glaciers. Blooms of snow algae can 
reduce the surface albedo (i.e., the ratio of reflected to incident light) of snow and ice, and largely 
affect their melting.
The ecology of snow algae is important for understanding the glacial ecosystem since they can 
be used as indicators to date ice cores drilled from glaciers. Their biomass and community structure 
inside ice cores may also provide information on the paleo-environment.
SOME LIKE IT HOT . . .
Another example of ecological diversification of algae is the colonization of thermal environments. 
In these complex, high-temperature systems, the microbial and geochemical interactions are highly 
interwoven, providing many of the basic constituents for the primordial synthesis of organic mol -
ecules and for the evolution of fundamental metabolic processes. Present-day hydrothermal vent -
ing occurs in both terrestrial and marine environments, primarily as a direct result of geothermal 
activity associated to plate tectonic movement. Spreading centers, subduction zones, and hot spot 
release heat from the crust and generate high-temperature water. Wherever fissures develop around 
hydrothermal vents, water can percolate into the crust and react with the surrounding rock, heating 
the fluid and altering its chemistry. The altered water will eventually be forced back convectively 
to the surface as superheated, highly reduced, hydrothermal fluid rich in gases and minerals. The 
hydrothermal fluid chemistry is a record of its path within the earth’s crust and differs as a function 
of the underlying rock composition and the residence time of the fluid in the subsurface.
Thermal waters are widely distributed over the face of the earth, although springs are often 
concentrated in restricted areas. The antiquity of many individual springs is noteworthy. Historical 
records of springs in the Mediterranean go back to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The largest 
concentrations of hot springs and fumaroles are found in Yellowstone National Park (USA), Iceland, 
New Zealand, Japan, and the USSR. Temperatures of hot springs range from 30°C up to boiling 
(90–100°C depending on the altitude).
Despite the geochemical constraints (physical and chemical parameters) defining the environ -
mental conditions of hydrothermal systems, these systems do support a plethora of unicellular 
microalgae (microorganisms). The pH of the habitat defines the composition of phototrophic com -
munities, which greatly differ between alkaline and acidic reaches.
Alkaline hot spring habitats across western North America, Asia, Africa, and possibly Europe 
have been studied for several decades for understanding the composition, structure, and function 
of microbial communities of thermal environments. Hot spring outflows typically exhibit marked 
temperature gradients, and microbial communities containing Synechococcus  (Cyanophyceae, 323 Oddities and Curiosities in the Algal World
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCCyanobacteria) generally develop in these systems at temperatures between about 45°C and 73°C, 
which is the thermal maximum for photosynthetic life. Studies on the behavior of C-phycocyanin 
from Synechoccocus lividus  showed that purified C-phycocyanin is stable up to least 70°C and it is 
highly aggregated with identical spectroscopic behaviors at 20°C and 70°C. For these characteris -
tics, it is termed temperature-resistant protein.
Thermoacidic environments are scattered disparately throughout the earth, but cluster mainly in 
volcanic areas that have constant geothermal activity and low pH levels, due primarily to the pres -
ence of sulfuric acid as a result of the biological and abiological oxidation of elemental sulfur or 
hydrogen sulfide. The biology of acid hot springs is quite different from that of the neutral/alkaline 
springs. Though most thermo-acidophiles are prokaryotes (Archea and Bacteria), photosynthetic 
prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, are completely absent from acid water even when the tempera -
ture has dropped to quite low values. The photosynthetic microorganisms of such acid water are rare 
kinds of eukaryotes found nowhere else on earth, the Cyanidiales (Cyanidiophyceae, Rhodopyta), 
a group of asexual unicellular red algae. Members of this rhodophytan order are able to live in 
extreme environments that combine low pH levels (~0.2–4.0) and moderately high temperatures of 
40–56°C throughout the globe. These algae often form well-developed mats in acidic geothermal 
locations. How this important physiological resistance is achieved is still not understood, though a 
strong proton pump or low proton membrane permeability are possibilities.
Three genera, that is, Cyanidium , Galdieria , and Cyanidioschyzon,  are recognized. The genera 
Cyanidium  and Cyanidioschyzon  are thought to include a single species each, Cyanidium caldar -
ium and Cyanidioschyzon merolae , respectively, whereas the genus Galdieria  has been classified 
into four species, Galdieria sulphuraria , Galdieria maxima , Galdieria partita , and Galdieria dae -
dala, based on cell morphology. The three genera have been distinguished morphologically, based 
on reproductive patterns, chloroplast, and mitochondrion shapes, the presence or absence of a vacu -
ole, cell size, and the presence or absence of a cell wall. Strains of the genus Cyanidioschyzon  are 
smaller (usually 1 or 2 μm in breadth), with an oval, club-like shape. They reproduce by binary 
cytokinesis and lack rigid cell walls. Galdieria  and Cyanidium  have more spherical shapes, possess 
rigid cell walls, and reproduce through the formation of 4–32 small daughter cells within a mother 
cell. Chloroplasts vary from a multilobed shape in G. sulphuraria  to a spherical shape in Cyanidium . 
These algae are not red, but blue-green, due to their predominant pigments, C-phycocyanin, and 
chlorophyll a. As in the case of Synechococcus , C-phycocyanin from Cyanidium  fits the charac -
teristics of a temperature-resistant protein. Its hallmark for stability is to remain inflexible toward 
structural change over a wide range of temperatures from 10°C to 50°C. The protein denatures 
irreversibly at the temperature at which the alga is no longer viable between 60°C and 65°C.
Geothermal environments are well known not only for their high temperature and their extremely 
acidic or basic pH, but also for their elevated content of toxicants such as arsenic and copper. Among 
the Cyanidiales, Cyanidioschyzon  has been shown to influence arsenic cycling at elevated tempera -
tures by oxidizing arsenite As(III) to arsenate As(V), and to methylate arsenic. The ability of this 
alga to transform arsenic represents a major mechanism for tolerance to high concentration of arse -
nic in acidic geothermal settings and contributes to the ecological fitness and ability of this red alga 
to flourish in such surroundings.
Also diatoms have been proved to be thermophilous and acidophilous and are able to survive 
in a toxic environment. An epipelic community of diatoms inhabits arsenic-rich hydrous ferric 
oxide mats that coat the sandy substratum of Beowulf Spring, Yellowstone National Park, USA, 
a strongly acidic (pH < 3) and thermophilous (temperature >50°C) environment with potentially 
toxic concentrations of dissolved metals. Diatoms are present mainly in the regions of the spring 
characterized by a temperature of 67°C, brown arsenic-rich mats, and a pH of 2.26. The diatom flora 
in this area is dominated by a deme within the Nitzschia thermalis  complex, in association with 
N. ovalis , Pinnularia acoricola , and Eunotia exigua . The success of this community may be due to 
low diatom diversity, hence reduced interspecific competition, and absence of predators, coupled to 
the potential metabolism of toxic metals.324 Algae

Crusts can be defined as microbiotic assemblages formed by living organisms and their  by-products, 
creating a complex surface structure of soil particles bound together by organic material. Some crusts 
are characterized by their marked increase in surface topography, often referred to as pinnacles or 
pedicles. Other crusts are merely rough or smooth and flat. The process of creating surface topogra -
phy, or pinnacling, is due largely to the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria and green algae. These 
organisms swell when wet, migrating out of their sheaths. After each migration, new sheath material 
is exuded, thus extending sheath length. Repeated swelling leaves a complex network of empty sheath 
material that maintains soil structure after the organisms have dehydrated and decreased in size.
Algal crusts of desert regions have been suggested to retard soil erosion, which generally includes 
rain and wind erosion. Although the erodibility of soil with and without crusts has been quantified, 
only a few studies have been focused on the specific effects of different algae in stabilization of sand 
dunes. The recovery rate of cryptogamic crusts (i.e., a thin crust made up of mosses, lichens, algae, 
and bacteria) in natural and artificial conditions has been examined, as well as the effect of the wind 
regime (including wind force and types), moisture, crust development, soil texture, vegetation cover -
age, season, and human activity on algal crust integrity. Most algal crust formation in arid areas is 
initiated by the growth of cyanobacteria during episodic events of available moisture with subsequent 
entrapment of mineral particles by the mechanical net of cyanobacterial filaments and glue of extra -
cellular slime. Algal crusts are critical to the ecosystem in which they occur. Evidence has shown 
that they may play important roles in the stabilization of soil surfaces and the improvement of soil 
structure, contributing significantly to soil fertility of these regions through processes such as nitro -
gen fixation, excretion of extracellular substances, and retention of soil particles, organic matter, and 
moisture. Nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria and lichens (due to their symbiotic cyanobacteria) com -
prising the crusts is the primary source of nitrogen input in many of the arid ecosystems on a world -
wide basis. The fascinating points herein are why and how the algal crusts, only a few millimeters 
thick, play such important roles, and how the relevant organisms survive and even flourish in such a 
harsh environment with extreme desiccation, strong radiation, and large fluctuation of temperature.
Systematic investigations of algal crusts conducted in the Tengger Desert (China) have provided 
data on the vertical microdistribution of cyanobacterial and algal species within samples aged 42, 
34, 17, 8, and 4 years. This vertical distribution was distinctly laminated into an inorganic layer 
with few algae (0.00–0.02 mm), an algae-dense-layer relatively compact and densely inhabited with 
algae (0.02–1.0 mm), and an algae-sparse layer (1.0–5.0 mm). Owing to extremely high irradia -
tion, the surface of the inorganic layer was the harshest microenvironment of the desert crusts, and 
therefore was colonized only with the cyanobacteria Scytonema javanicum , and Nostoc flagelli -
forme , desiccation-tolerant species possessing high UV screening pigments. These two heterocys -
tous, diazotrophic species were the only algae found at the depth of approximately 0.02–0.05 mm, 
while around 0.05–0.10 mm, the coccoid green alga Desmococcus olivaceus  (Trebuxiophyceae, 
Chlorophyta), characterized by strong resistance to stressful environments, was the dominant spe -
cies. The biggest algal biovolume was present at 0.10–0.15 mm, with the dominance of Microcoleus 
vaginatus  (Cyanophyceae, Cyanobacteria), a sheath-forming and polysaccharide-excreting cyano -
bacterium capable of stabilizing sand grains. The diversity of algal species was the largest in all 
the crust samples at the depth of approximately 0.15–0.50 mm. Filamentous ( Anabaena azotica , 
Phormidium tenue , and Lyngbya cryptovaginatus ) and unicellular cyanobacteria ( Gloeocapsa  sp. 
and Synechocystis pevalekii ), unicellular coccoid green algae ( Chlamydomonas  sp.), Chlorococcum 
humicola  (Chlorophyceae), Chlorella vulgaris  and Palmellococcus miniatus  (Trebuxiophyceae), 
diatoms ( Navicula cryptocephala , Diatoma vulgare  var. ovalis  and Hantzschia amphioxys ), and 
euglenoids ( Euglena  spp.) were present. Within the range of approximately 0.50–1.00 mm, there 
were much more green algae and euglenoids than in the other strata. Because the upper 1 mm of 
the crust was the euphotic zone (i.e., the zone where enough light penetrates for photosynthesis to 
occur), more than 96% algal biovolume was distributed in this algae-dense layer (0.02–1.0 mm). By 325 Oddities and Curiosities in the Algal World
© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCthe algae-sparse layer, dramatically reduced irradiance was inadequate for efficient photosynthesis 
and therefore this layer had only about 4% of the total algal biovolume. At 1.0–2.0 mm, species 
usually found were L. cryptovaginatus , M. vaginatus , P. tenue , S. pevalekii , N. cryptocephala , 
and H. amphioxys . At the depth of approximately 2.0–3.0 mm, P. tenue  was the dominant species 
together with diatoms, mainly N. cryptocephala  and H. amphioxys . At the depth of approximately 
3.0–4.0 mm, only diatoms were present. Existence of a diatom layer at the crust base might be the 
result of downward seepage of water and the high motility of these algae.
The older the crusts, the nearer to the surface were Nostoc  sp., C. vulgaris , M. vaginatus , N. 
cryptocephala  and fungi, which might be less resistant to the surface stresses. This might reflect 
the slow but effective process of algal crust development at early stages, and this process might be 
beneficial to the transformation from algal crusts to lichen crusts at later stages in consideration of 
the integration of cyanobacteria and green algae, such as Nostoc , with fungi to form lichen.

EDITION
K13023“ ... stands out for its in-depth information on structural and mechanical anatomy, 
with flagella as the most prominent example. The meticulous and elegant 
drawings of algal apparatuses and their mechanics make it easy to understand 
complex structures and functions, as well as constitutes another outstanding feature of this book.”
—Senjie Lin, Marine Sciences, University of Connecticut, Groton, The Quarterly 
Review of Biology, Vol. 81, December 2006
“ ... the authors concentrate on highlighting interesting and illuminating topics, 
with the idea of inciting the sort of wonder and curiosity that will encourage 
further outstanding research.”—Willem F . Prud’homme van Reine, Blumea, 2006, Vol. 51, No.3
A single-source reference on the biology of algae, Algae: Anatomy, Biochem-
istry, and Biotechnology, Second Edition  examines the most important taxa 
and structures for freshwater, marine, and terrestrial forms of algae. Its com -
prehensive coverage goes from algae’s historical role through its taxonomy and ecology to its natural product possibilities.
The authors have gathered a significant amount of new material since the 
publication of the first edition. This completely revised second edition contains 
many changes and additions including the following:
• All revised and rewritten tables, plus new figures, many in color
• A fascinating new chapter: Oddities and Curiosities in the Algal World
• Expanded information on algal anatomy
• Absorption spectra from all algal divisions, chlorophylls, and accessory 
pigments
• Additional information on collection, storage, and preservation of algae
• Updated section on algal toxins and algal bioactive molecules
The book’s unifying theme is on the important role of algae in the earth’s 
self-regulating life support system and its function within restorative models of planetary health. It also discusses algae’s biotechnological applications, 
including potential nutritional and pharmaceutical products. Written for students 
as well as researchers, teachers, and professionals in the field of phycology and applied phycology, this new full-color edition is both illuminating and inspiring. Biological Sciences
