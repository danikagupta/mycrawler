CLINICAL VIGNETTE
The Serotonin Syndrome
Neil Patel, M.D.
Case Presentation
A 46-year-old male was brought from his home to the
Emergency Department by the paramedics. His chief
complaint was the complaint of a “seizure”. Onarrival to the ED, the patient was unable to provide ahistory, however EMS stated that the patient’s
girlfriend had found him in bed, unresponsive and
“shaking all over.” No true tonic-clonic movementswere noted. Blood sugar was 180 in the field and past
medical history included PTSD and hypertension.
The patient was reportedly taking paroxetine 50mgand hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily. There was no
history of prior seizures.
On arrival in the ED, his rectal temperature was
38.8 °C, BP 196/110, pulse 122, respiratory rate 20
and O2 saturation 99% on room air. The patient was
to be non-verbal and had an intact, though diminishedgag reflex. A rapid neurological exam revealedreactive pupillary mydriasis, a fine tremor in both
upper and lower extremities, increased bilateral lower
extremity tone with inducible clonus and exaggeratedpatellar and heel deep-tendon reflexes. The patient
localized to painful stimuli with both upper
extremities. He was also noted to be rather
diaphoretic with hyperactive bowel sounds and
slightly increased oral salivation. The remainder of
the exam was unremarkable.
Given the patient’s mental status, he was intubated
for airway protection using etomidate and
succinylcholine and was immediately sent for a CTHead that was negative for acute disease process.During this time, telephone contact with the patient’s
girlfriend revealed that 6 hours prior to EMS
activation, the patient had consumed approximately ahalf-bottle (200cc) of over-the-counter
dextromethorphan cough syrup in an attempt torelieve a dry cough that he had been suffering from
for the past 2 days.
A preliminary diagnosis of serotonin syndrome was
made and the patient was given 12mg ofcyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist vianasogastric tube. Chest x-ray revealed no acute
infiltrate and the rest of the patient’s ED work-up wasnegative for an infectious etiology, and the patientwas admitted to the ICU for close observation.
In the ICU, the patient’s mental status gradually
improved and he was extubated. No significant
laboratory derangements were noted. The patient was
discharged home with a diagnosis of serotoninsyndrome. He was taught which medications to avoid
when taking an SSRI such as paroxetine.
Discussion
Serotonin syndrome is thought to result from the
over-stimulation of serotonin (5-HT) receptors in theCNS, usually as the result of pharmacological agents.
This is usually due to an overdose of a single
serotonergic agent (such as an SSRI) or lesscommonly, from a drug-drug interaction between twoor more serotonergic drugs that results in excess
levels of 5-HT in the synaptic cleft
1. Indeed,
approximately 10% of single-agent SSRI overdose
cases resulted in the serotonin syndrome2. Often, the
offending agent is not commonly known to have
serotonergic properties and thus therapeutic
misadventure can easily result.  A survey done in theUK in the late 1990s revealed that approximately
85% of clinicians were unaware of the existence of
the serotonin syndrome
3. Therefore, it is not
surprising that commonly prescribed medicationssuch as dextromethorphan, meperidine and tramadol
can lead to the serotonin syndrome when combined
with the SSRI class of antidepressants
4.
In addition, commonly available drugs of abuse such
as cocaine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA or “ecstasy”) and lysergic acid diethylamide(LSD) can lead also precipitate this syndrome when
combined with SSRIs. Caution should also be
exercised when combining SSRI with otherpsychotropic medications such as tricyclicantidepressants (TCAs), MAOIs and lithium as well
as with the anti-emetics odansetron and
metoclopramide
5. Therefore, it is of vital importance
that clinicians familiarize themselves with the
serotonin syndrome and check for drug-drug
Proceedings of UCLA Healthcare

interactions that can lead to this potentially fatal
syndrome.
The serotonin syndrome is exclusively a clinical
diagnosis without any confirmatory laboratory or
radiographic findings. It is often thought of as a
clinical triad involving autonomic hyperactivity,
alteration in mental status and neuromuscular
dysfunction. However, as with many classic triads,
not all features are necessarily present in all patients5.
To assist clinicians in the diagnosis of this syndrome,
the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria, have been
developed which report a sensitivity and specificity
of 84% and 97%, respectively in identifying this
syndrome6. According to these criteria, a patient must
have exposure to a serotonergic agent along with one
of the following:
·Spontaneous clonus
·Inducible clonus + agitation or diaphoresis
·Ocular clonus + agitation or diaphoresis
·Hypertonia
·Temperature >38 °C + inducible or ocular
clonus
As is expected, the serotonin syndrome can range in
severity from mild to severe and can be life-
threatening. Symptoms tend to manifest within
several hours of taking the offending agent5. At the
mild end of the spectrum, patients may exhibit only a
mild tremor and possibly hypertension, whereas in its
severe form, patients can be severely hyperthermic
and increased neuromuscular activity can lead to
rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.
A review of 127 cases reported the most common
clinical findings were myoclonus, hyperreflexia,
tachycardia, confusion, hyperthermia and
diaphoresis. They also found that serum levels of
serotonergic drugs was either therapeutic or sub-
therapeutic, making the syndrome possible even in
the absence of overdose7. Therefore, a high index of
suspicion must be maintained for this diagnosis in the
correct clinical setting.
As can be imagined, the differential diagnosis for a
patient presenting with the signs and symptoms of the
serotonin syndrome is diverse and includes
hypoglycemia, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis,
cocaine/amphetamine ingestion,
alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal and seizure.
However, the neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(NMS) and malignant hyperthermia are most often
confused with the serotonin syndrome.  In NMS, one
often finds that there is a ”lead-pipe” rigidity to the
musculature rather than clonus and history suggests
the intake of a neuroleptic (rather than a serotonergic)agent, making the two entities clinically
distinguishable8. Malignant hyperthermia, on the
other hand, usually occurs within minutes after
administration of succinylcholine or an inhaled
anesthetic and presents with hyporeflexia (rather than
the hyperreflexia of serotonin syndrome)9.
Once the diagnosis is suspected, treatment generally
focuses on supportive care and the cessation of all
serotonergic agents. Protection of the airway is the
highest concern and patients with persistent altered
mental status should be intubated. Patients with
significant neuromuscular activity leading to
hyperthermia and/or rhabdomyolysis, intubation and
skeletal muscle paralysis with long-acting non-
depolarizing agents such as vecuronium should be
highly considered10.
Once the airway is stable and serotonergic drugs have
been discontinued, treatment focuses on the
normalization of vital signs and chemical sedation of
the agitated or anxious patient. IV crystalloid fluids
should be provided to restore intravascular volume
and replace increased insensible losses from elevated
neuromuscular activity. Benzodiazepines should also
be used to achieve chemical sedation as physical
restrains will not reduce neuromuscular activity and
puts patients at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis11.
Indeed, benzodiazepines have been shown to improve
survival in animal models12, 13.
Though shown to be effective in only small trials,
adjunctive treatment with 5-HT receptor antagonists
such as cyproheptadine remains the recommended
therapy for moderate to severe cases of the serotonin
syndrome13, 14. Cyproheptadine acts as a 5HT 1A and
5-HT 2 receptor antagonist, and should be given at an
initial adult dose of 8 to 12 mg, followed by 2 mg
every two hours until a clinical response is
achieved15. Of note, this drug is only available in oral
form and is administered via nasogastric tube in
intubated patients. In severe cases, chlorpromazine (a
neuroleptic agent with non-specific serotonin
receptor antagonism properties) can be used in doses
of 50 to 100 mg and can be given parenterally (either
IM or IV). However, one must be sure to differentiate
serotonin syndrome from the neuroleptic malignant
syndrome as use of chlorpromazine can exacerbate
the latter condition13.
Patients will typically improve within 24 to 72 hours
with the cessation of all serotonergic agents and the
selective use of the above therapies, as was noted in
our subject patient5. The key in limiting morbidity
and mortality from the serotonin syndrome lies in its
prevention. Therefore, it is critically important that

clinicians become aware of this rare, though
clinically important, syndrome and take measures,
such as the use of electronic pharmacopeias and
medication reconciliation, to ensure that drugs they
are prescribing do not interfere with serotonergic
agents that a patient may already be taking.
