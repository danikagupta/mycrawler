Abstract
A novel modified Fenton process using heterogeneous catalyst (swarf) was developed to catalyze the 
oxidation reaction of azo dye Acid Red 18. It was found that swarf could be used to replace iron salts as a 
catalyst for the Fenton reaction. The examined continuous Fenton process proved to be very efficient for 
decolorization of simulated wastewater containing 100 mg/dm3 Acid Red 18. Performance of the Fenton 
reactor and regeneration method of the catalyst was discussed. The simplified mechanism of hydroxyl radi -
cal production in the presence of swarf as a catalyst also was proposed.

Introduction
The development of novel treatment methods encom -
passes investigations of advanced oxidation processes 
(AOPs), which are characterized by production of the 
hydroxyl radical (OH•) as a primary oxidant [1]. Among 
various AOPs, the Fenton reagent (H2O2/Fe2+) is one of 
the most effective methods of organic pollutant oxidation. 
The Fenton reagent has been found to be effective in treat -
ing various industrial wastewater components including 
aromatic amines [2] and a wide variety of dyes [3, 4] as 
well as many other substances, e.g. pesticides [5, 6] and 
surfactants [7, 8]. Therefore, the Fenton reagent has been 
applied to treat a variety of wastes such as those associ -
ated with the textile and chemical industries.
The advantage of the Fenton reagent is that no ener -
gy input is necessary to activate hydrogen peroxide [9]. 
Therefore, this method offers a cost-effective source of 
hydroxyl radicals, using easy-to-handle reagents. How -
ever, disadvantages in using the Fenton reagent include 
the production of a substantial amount of Fe(OH)3 pre-cipitate [10] and additional water pollution caused by 
the homogeneous catalyst that added as an iron salt, can -
not be retained in the process [9]. To solve these prob -
lems, the application of alternative iron sources as cata -
lysts in oxidizing organic contaminants has been studied 
extensively. A number of researchers have investigated 
the application of iron oxides such as hematite, ferrihy -
drite, semicrystalline iron oxide and crystalline goethite 
[11−15]. They generally have observed a greatly accel -
erated decomposition of hydrogen peroxide but variable 
amounts of contaminant were lost. The Fenton reactions 
also were observed with an iron-containing zeolite [16]. 
Chou and Huang [10] developed a novel supported iron 
oxyhydroxide (γ-FeOOH) granular catalyst and proved 
that it can be effective catalyst of H2O2 in oxidizing  
benzoic acid.
Another group of investigations consisted in the appli -
cation of iron powder in the H2O2/Fe0 system. Zero-valent 
iron metal (Fe0) is a very promising reactive medium due 
to its low-cost, effectiveness, ability to degrade contami -
nants and its accessibility [17, 18]. It was found that iron 
powder could be used to replace iron salts as a catalyst for 
the Fenton reaction [9, 19, 20]. *e-mail: krzybar0@poczta.onet.plBarbusiński K. 282
In this study a novel modified Fenton process using het -
erogeneous catalyst (swarf) was developed to catalyze the 
oxidation reaction of azo dye wastewater [21]. A continu -
ous process was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility 
of color removal from dye wastewater by the novel oxi -
dation technology. The performance of the Fenton reactor 
and regeneration method of the catalyst was discussed. The 
simplified mechanism of hydroxyl radical production in the 
presence of swarf as a catalyst also was proposed. 
Materials and Methods
Dye Wastewater
The simulated dye wastewater was prepared by di -
luting commercial azo dye Acid Red 18 (Boruta S.A., 
Poland) in water. The dye was in high purity and used 
without further purification. The concentration of dye was 
100 mg/dm3. The wastewater was characterized by an in -
tensive red-ponceau colour, high clarity and COD = 94 
mg/dm3. The structure of Acid Red 18 is shown in Fig. 1.
Experimental Procedure
The experimental reactor was designed as illustrated 
schematically in Fig. 2. The simulated dye wastewater 
was adjusted with H2SO4 to pH 2.5 and then H2O2 (30 
wt%) dose of 150 mg/dm3 was added. The obtained solu -
tion was pumped (with a flow rate of 0.67 m/h) with the 
help of a peristaltic pump to the Fenton reactor consisting 
of a glass column (diameter of 2.5 cm, bed height 7 cm) 
filled with a swarf as a catalyst. The swarf was created 
during metal sawing and the particle size of swarf was 
in the range of 0.5-2.5 mm. Chemical constitution of the 
general-purpose steel used as a catalyst (swarf) is shown 
in Table 1. After selected times, samples of an effluent 
from the Fenton reactor were withdrawn and neutralized 
with 0.1 N NaOH up to pH 9 in order to prevent further 
generation of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton re -
action. Next, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm 
(2.5 min) and were analyzed at the maximum adsorption 
wavelengths of 510 nm, using a Carl Zeiss Technology 
UV-V IS Spectrophoto-meter.Iron ions released during the experiment were ana -
lyzed with atom absorption spectroscopy (AAS 3, Carl 
Zeiss Jena).
In the second part of the investigations, the experi -
mental reactor also was operated in the same manner 
as described above but this time H2O2 was not added to 
simulated dye wastewater. This experiment was carried 
out in order to investigate the efficiency of wastewater de -
colorization due to chemisorption of the dye on the swarf 
surface. For example, Tang and Chen [19] concluded that 
chemisorption of the dye on the iron powder surface was 
considered a possible mechanism of decolorization be -
cause oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the dye molecule can 
serve as ligands in complexing with Fe2+ and Fe3+ sites on 
the iron powder surface.
Results and Discussion
Decolorization of Dye Wastewater with H2O2
The experiment was carried out to find out if the 
swarf can be used as a catalyst in the continuous modi -
fied Fenton process. Simulated dye wastewater was 
decolorized through catalytic oxidation in the Fenton 
reactor for 120 hours. The changes of color removal ef -
ficiency in the course of 24-hour Fenton oxidation are 
shown in Fig. 3. Color removal efficiency was rapidly 
increased to 95.4% within the first 60 minutes, and then 
a slight increase in color removal was observed within 
up to 240 minutes. After that, color removal efficiency 
rapidly decreased from 96.6 to 91.6% and then slow -
ly diminished to 89.8% within up to 10 hours. Color 
removal efficiency in the range of 89.8%−89.1% was 
maintained up to 24 hours and then its slight decrease 
to 88.7% at 120 hours was observed. The presence of 
iron cause the effluent from the Fenton reactor to be 
slightly yellowish, but after being neutralization with 
NaOH, total visual decolorization was achieved (Fig. 
3). The absorbance of effluent after being neutralizing 
with NaOH was maintained at lower than 0.022 nm. 
After 120 hours of operation (nearly 39 dm3 of waste -
water was decolorized), the effluent became increas -
ingly pink and then a specific red-ponceau colour was 
observed. The catalyst (swarf) seemed to be no longer 
active, which may have been caused by iron oxides 
forming on the surface of the swarf.

In order to regenerate the catalyst, the Fenton reac -
tor was flushed with distilled water and filled with H2SO4 
(1+9). After 1 hour, the Fenton reactor was once more 
flushed with distilled water and within the next 30 hours 
simulated dye wastewater was decolorized through cata -
lytic oxidation. This phenomenon could be explained by 
the dissolution of iron oxides formed on the surface of the 
swarf, reactivating the catalyst. 
The effect of catalyst regeneration time on time in 
which dye wastewater was effectively decolorized by the 
Fenton reactor was not investigated in this study. How -
ever, it may be assumed that longer regeneration time of 
catalyst will be causing more effective decolorization of 
dye wastewater.
Decolorization of Dye Wastewater without H2O2
In the second part of investigations, simulated dye 
wastewater was treated in the experimental reactor with -
out adding H2O2 to the wastewater tank. Fig. 4 shows the 
changes of color removal efficiency in the effluent dur -
ing the first 7 hours of decolorization of dye wastewater. 
The effectiveness of color removal was increased only 
to 26.4% within the first 60 minutes. After that, color re -
moval efficiency rapidly decreased to 12.1% (120 min -
ute) and then slowly diminished to 10.2% within up to 
180 minutes. The color removal efficiency in the range 
of 9.8%−10.5% was maintained up to the 7th hour, when 
the experiment was finished. In no case was visual de -
colorization achieved, even after being neutralizing with 
NaOH.At the same time, the pH was rapidly increased from 
2.5 to 5.0 within the first 10 minutes. After that, a clear 
decrease in pH to the range of 4.0−4.2 was observed up to 
the 7th hour when the experiment was finished.
The above results clearly showed that chemisorption 
of the dye on the swarf surface has occurred only in a 
small degree. This process does not have significant in -
fluence on decolorization efficiency of investigated dye 
wastewater.
Mechanism of the Modified Fenton Process
Decolorization of the dye wastewater by catalytic 
oxidation using swarf as a catalyst can be explained by 
the fact that in an aqueous solution, under acidic condi -
tions, Fe2+ ions are released to the solution by the swarf. 
This phenomenon was observed previously by Tang and 
Chen [19] in relation to iron powder. This acknowledges 
the fact that the Fenton reaction is effective at acidic 
conditions.
The changes of Fe concentration in the course of 24 
hours of Fenton oxidation are shown in Fig. 5. Iron ion 
concentration rapidly increased to 92.6 mg/dm3 within 
the first 240 minutes. After that, Fe concentration rapidly 
dropped from 92.6 to 67.1 mg/dm3 and then slowly di -
minished to 61.6 mg/dm3 within up to 10 hours. Then, a 
small decrease in Fe concentration to 59.3 mg/dm3 was 
observed within up to 24 hours.
Analysis of Figs. 3 and 5 clearly shows a potential re -
lationship between Fe concentration in the solution and 
color removal efficiency. Fig. 6 presents the effect of Fe Table 1. Chemical constitution of the general-purpose steel used as a catalyst.

concentration released from the swarf on color removal 
efficiency in the modified Fenton process. The color re -
moval efficiency enhanced while the concentration of Fe 
ions was increased. As the Fe concentration increased 
from 3.2 to 37.5 mg/dm3, color removal efficiency rap -
idly increased from 82.0 to 95.4%. However, when the 
concentration of Fe ions exceeded 37.5 mg/dm3, only a 
slight increase from 95.4 to 96.6% was observed. On the 
contrary, the decrease of Fe concentration in the solu -
tion caused a significant, nearly linear decrease in color 
removal.
The swarf acts as a heterogeneous catalyst for the ac -
tivation of hydrogen peroxide. When swarf is used as a 
solid catalyst, Fe ions are leached from the solid material. 
Then, the iron ions act as homogeneous catalyst for the 
activation of H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals accord -
ing to the Fenton reaction.
Because the swarf release Fe2+ ions to the solution 
under acidic conditions, iron dissolution is an initial step 
for the oxidation of contaminants (e.g. dyes) by the H2O2/
swarf process. When dye oxidation occurs, the initial Fe2+ 
ions are consumed, and then the oxidation rate will de -
pend on the dissolution rate of Fe2+. The proposed mecha -
nism of hydroxyl radical production in the presence of 
the swarf catalyst is presented in Fig. 7. This mechanism 
has three stages: 1st - dissolution of swarf and release of Fe2+ ions, 2nd - the Fenton reaction including formation of 
hydroxyl radicals OH•, and 3rd - oxidation of dye.
Conclusions
The results confirm the thesis that swarf can be 
used as a source of Fe ions (catalyst) in the continuous 
Fenton process. It was observed that swarf acted as a 
heterogeneous catalyst for the activation of hydrogen 
peroxide. The modified continuous Fenton process was 
found to be very efficient for decolorization of simu -
lated wastewater containing 100 mg dm-3 of the com -
mercial azo dye Acid Red 18. A simplified mechanism 
of hydroxyl radical production in the presence of swarf 
as a catalyst was proposed.
These results suggest that, compared with both the 
classical Fenton reaction and Fenton reaction with alterna -
tive iron sources, the novel Fenton process (H2O2/swarf) 
has clear advantages. This process is relatively economi -
cal because the swarf can be used as a discard material, 
e.g. from machining. The continuous Fenton process is 
easy to operate, allowing it to retain the catalyst in the 
process and thus the catalyst (swarf) can be used repeat -
edly. The modified Fenton reaction with the use of steel 
swarf in continuous-flow systems offers greater possibili -
ties for practical application of Fenton reagent. Further 
experiments concerning the optimization of the novel 
Fenton process are in progress.
