Large, living biological specimens present challenges to existing optical
imaging techniques because of their absorptive and scattering properties.We developed selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM)to generatemultidimensional images of samples up to a few millimeters in size. Thesystem combines two-dimensional illumination with orthogonal camera-based detection to achieve high-resolution, optically sectioned imagingthroughout the sample, with minimal photodamage and at speeds capableof capturing transient biological phenomena. We used SPIM to visualize allmuscles in vivo in the transgenic Medaka line Arnie, which expresses greenﬂuorescent protein in muscle tissue. We also demonstrate that SPIM can beapplied to visualize the embryogenesis of the relatively opaque Drosophila
melanogaster in vivo.
Modern life science research often requires
multidimensional imaging of a completespatiotemporal pattern of gene and proteinexpression or tracking of tissues during thedevelopment of an intact embryo ( 1). In
order to visualize the precise distribution ofdevelopmental events such as activation ofspecific genes, a wide range of processes,from small-scale (subcellular) to large-scale (millimeters), needs to be followed.Ideally, such events, which can last fromseconds to days, will be observed in liveand fully intact embryos.
Several techniques have been developed
that allow mapping of the three-dimensional(3D) structure of large samples ( 2). Gene
expression has been monitored by in situhybridization and block-face imaging ( 3).
Techniques that provide noninvasive (opti-cal) sectioning, as opposed to those thatdestroy the sample, are indispensable forlive studies. Optical projection tomographycan image fixed embryos at high resolution(4). Magnetic resonance imaging ( 5) and
optical coherence tomography ( 6) feature
noninvasive imaging, but do not providespecific contrasts easily.
In optical microscopy, green fluorescent
protein (GFP) and its spectral variants are usedfor high-resolution visualization of protein lo-calization patterns in living organisms ( 7).
When GFP-labeled samples are viewed, op-tical sectioning (which is essential for itselimination of out-of-focus light) is obtain-able by laser scanning microscopy (LSM),either by detection through a pinhole (con-
focal LSM) ( 8) or by exploitation of the
nonlinear properties of a fluorophore (mul-tiphoton microscopy) ( 9). Despite the im-proved resolution, LSM suffers from two ma-
jor limitations: a limited penetration depth inheterogeneous samples and a marked differ-ence between the lateral and axial resolution.
We developed selective plane illumina-
tion microscopy (SPIM), in which opticalsectioning is achieved by illuminating thesample along a separate optical path or-thogonal to the detection axis (Fig. 1 andfig. S1). A similar approach in confocaltheta microscopy has been demonstrated toimprove axial resolution ( 10–12 ). In SPIM,
the excitation light is focused by a cylin-drical lens to a sheet of light that illumi-nates only the focal plane of the detectionoptics, so that no out-of-focus fluorescenceis generated (optical sectioning). The neteffect is similar to that achieved by con-focal LSM. However, in SPIM, only theplane currently observed is illuminated andtherefore affected by bleaching. Therefore,the total number of fluorophore excitationsrequired to image a 3D sample is greatlyreduced compared to the number in con-focal LSM (supporting online text).
GFP-labeled transgenic embryos of the
teleost fish Medaka ( Oryzias latipes )(13)
were imaged with SPIM. In order to visu-

transgenic line Arnie, which expresses GFPin somatic and smooth muscles as well as inthe heart ( 14). A 4-day-old fixed Arnie
embryo [stage 32 ( 15)] is shown in Fig. 1.
SPIM was capable of resolving the internalstructures of the entire organism with highresolution (better than 6 /H9262m) as deep as 500
/H9262m inside the fish, a penetration depth that
cannot be reached using confocal LSM (fig.S6). The axial resolution in SPIM is deter-mined by the lateral width of the lightsheet; for the configuration shown in Fig. 1,the axial extent of the point spread function(PSF) was about 6 /H9262m, whereas without the
light sheet it was more than 20 /H9262m (sup-
porting online text).
Any fluorescence imaging system suf-
fers from scattering and absorption in thetissue; in large and highly scattering sam-ples, the image quality decreases as theoptical path length in the sample increases.This problem can be reduced by a multi-view reconstruction, in which multiple 3Ddata sets of the same object are collectedfrom different directions and combined in apostprocessing step ( 16–18). The high-
quality information is extracted from eachdata set and merged into a single, superior3D image (supporting online text). Oneway to do this is by parallel image acqui-sition, using more than one lens for thedetection of fluorescence ( 18).
We collected SPIM data for a multiview
reconstruction sequentially by generatingmultiple image stacks between which thesample was rotated. Sample deformationswere avoided with a rotation axis parallel togravity (Fig. 1). In contrast to tomographicreconstruction techniques [such as those in(4)], which require extensive processing of
the data to yield any meaningful 3D informa-tion, rotation and subsequent data processingare optional in SPIM. They allow a furtherincrease in image quality and axial resolutioncompared to a single stack, but in many casesa single, unprocessed 3D SPIM stack aloneprovides sufficient information.
We performed a multiview reconstruction
with four stacks taken with four orientationsof the same sample (figs. S2 and S3). Com-bination of these stacks (supporting onlinetext) yielded a complete view of the sample,/H110111.5 mm long and /H110110.9 mm wide. In Fig. 2,
the complete fused data set is shown and themost pronounced tissues are labeled. The de-crease in image quality with penetrationdepth is corrected by the fusion process. Ityielded an increased information content inregions that were obscured (by absorption orscattering in the sample) in some of the un-processed single views.
The method of embedding the sample in
a low-concentration agarose cylinder isnondisruptive and easily applied to liveembryos. We routinely image live Medaka
andDrosophila embryos over periods of up
to 3 days without detrimental effects onembryogenesis and development. To dem-onstrate the potential of SPIM technology,we investigated the Medaka heart, a struc-ture barely accessible by conventional con-focal LSM because of its ventral position inthe yolk cell. We imaged transgenic
Medaka Arnie embryos and show a recon-struction of the inner heart surface (Fig.3A) derived from the data set shown in Fig.2. This reveals the internal structure of theheart ventricle and atrium. In a slightlyearlier stage, internal organs such as theheart and other mesoendodermal deriva-

under the body of the embryo (Fig. 3B). InFig. 3, C to E, three optical sections atdifferent depths illustrate GFP expressionin the muscles of the living heart. Fastframe recording (10 frames per s) allowsimaging of the heartbeat (movies S3 andS4); similar imaging has previously onlybeen demonstrated at stages when the heartis exposed and by cooling the embryo toreduce the heart rate ( 19).
To demonstrate that SPIM can also be
used to image the internal structures of rela-tively opaque embryos, we recorded a timeseries (movie S5) of the embryogenesis of thefruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Fig. 4).
GFP-moesin labeled the plasma membranethroughout the embryo ( 20). Even without
multiview reconstruction, structures insidethe embryo are clearly identifiable and trace-able. Stacks (56 planes each) were taken au-tomatically every 5 min over a period of 17hours, without refocusing or realignment.Even after being irradiated for 11,480 imag-es, the embryo was unaffected and completed
embryogenesis normally.
In summary, we present an optical wide-
field microscope capable of imaging pro-tein expression patterns deep inside bothfixed and live embryos. By selective illu-mination of a single plane, the excitationlight is used efficiently to achieve opticalsectioning and reduced photodamage inlarge samples, key features in the study ofembryonic development. The method ofsample mounting allows positioning androtation to orient the sample for op-timal imaging conditions. The optionalmultiview reconstruction combines inde-pendently acquired data sets into an opti-mal representation of the sample. Theimplementation of other contrasts such asscattered light will be straightforward. Thesystem is compact, fast, optically stable,and easy to use.
SPIM is well suited for the visualization
of high-resolution gene and protein ex-pression patterns in three dimensions in thecontext of morphogenesis. Heart function
and development can be precisely followedin vivo using SPIM in Arnie transgenicembryos. Because of its speed and its au-tomatable operation, SPIM can serve as atool for large-scale studies of developingorganisms and the systematic and compre-hensive acquisition and collection of ex-pression data. Even screens for moleculesthat interfere with development andregeneration on a medium-throughput scaleseem feasible. SPIM technology can bereadily applied to a wide range of organ-isms, from whole embryos to single cells.Subcellular resolution can be obtained inlive samples kept in a biologically relevantenvironment within the organism or in cul-ture. Therefore, SPIM also has the po-tential to be of use in the promising fieldsof 3D cultured cells ( 21) and 3D cell
migration ( 22).

The images werenormalizedto exhibit the same overall intensity, thus compensating the continuous prod uction ofGFP-moesin.
