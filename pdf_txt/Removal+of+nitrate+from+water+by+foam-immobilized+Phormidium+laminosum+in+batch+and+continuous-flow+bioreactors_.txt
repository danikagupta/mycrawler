To improve crop yield and control broadleaf weeds, many farmers apply nitrate -
based fertilizers and chemical he rbicides to their fields. Excessive use of these chemicals 
can cause contamination in waterbodies and impact on the public health. The physical and 
chemical methods have been suggested to remove these herbicides are usually costly. In 
this study, the capab ility of immobilized algal beads in removing nitrate and several 
herbicides of environmental concern from synthetic and actual groundwater and surface 
water was evaluated.  
The experiments were performed in batch, sequencing batch and continuous flow 
modes  and the effect of different operational conditions (light intensity, cultivation method, 
algal density, and temperature) on the performance of algal beads were assessed and the 
capability of the system in real working scenarios was evaluated.  
The results from batch studies showed that Scenedesmus species  cells, immobilized 
in sodium alginate are capable of removing 90% of nitrate from synthetic and actual 
groundwater with the beads/water ratio of 12.5%. The beads performance improved in 
heterot rophic conditions and the presence of light enhanced the nitrate removal. 
Immobilized algal beads were capable of uptaking nitrate for 100 consecutive days, and  
 
` the equal volumetric ratio of alga: alginate led to the highest nitrate uptake in sequencing 
batch mode.  
Immobilized beads showed higher nitrate and atrazine uptake at room temperature 
(20 °C) in continuous flow reactor. When tested with the actual groundwater and surface 
water samples, atrazine, oxadiazon, triallate, cycloate, alachlor, simetryn a nd ametryn were 
partially removed through adsorption, bioaccumulation, and biodegradation. The presence 
of herbicides and toxins in the water lowered the efficiency of the immobilized beads.  
Embedding immobilized algal beads with nanoclay was found to be an effective 
method to accelerate nitrate and atrazine uptake rate.  Near ly 100% of 10 mg/L nitrate and 
90% of 0.1 mg/L atrazine were removed in 3 days at the concentration of 0.3 mg Nanoclay 
per bead.  The nitrate uptake capacity of the nanoclay -embedded algal beads was found to 
be through three mechanisms of adsorption, biological assimilation, and extracellular 
enzyme activity resulting from toxicity.  i

INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  
Agricultural contaminants can impair the quality of our water resources. Fertilizers and 
herbicides do  not remain stationary on  the land where they are applied and can enter 
streams, rivers, and groundwater through runoff and infiltration (USGS, 2010) . 
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plants and is used in various forms as fertilizer to 
enhance plants growth. Excess nitrogen in soil can infiltrate into the groundwater, 
commonly in the form of nitrate (Peña -Haro, Llopis -Albert, Pulido -Velazquez, & Pulido -
Velazquez, 2010) . 
As it is shown in Figure 1.1 , Midwest and parts of the western and northeastern United 
States are high -risk of groundwater contamination by nit rate. 
 
Figure 1.1 Areas in the United States with the highest risk of nitrate contamination (Dubrovsky, 
2010) .

` Herbicides are synthetic organic compounds (i.e pesticides) used to control weeds, insects, 
and a variety of ot her agricultural purposes. Many herbicides are water -soluble and may 
dissolve in groundwater. Groundwater with elevated levels of nitrate or herbicides is not 
safe for human consumption  and can cause adverse environmental impacts when 
discharged to the str eams (Ator & Ferrari, 1997; Wick, Heumesser, & Schmid , 2012) . 
Several technologies have been applied for the treatment of groundwater:  including reverse 
osmosis, ion exchange, and chemical and biological methods.  
Currently, the best method to eliminate nitrate and herbicides is reverse osmosis. In a 
reverse osmosis system, a high -pressure pump is used to force the water across a semi -
permeable membrane, leaving about 85 -95% of nitrate behind in the reject stream. The 
amount of pressure required for the system depends on the quality of the feed wa ter. The 
membranes of the system need to be replaced on a regular basis (Eisenberg & 
Middlebrooks, 20 13) 
Ion Exchange process in another method for nitrate remediation which works by passing 
nitrate contaminated water through a tank, filed with resin beads. The resin is saturated 
with chloride which chemically trades places with nitrate ions. Once exha usted, the resin 
needs to be recharged by backwashing , typically with a strength sodium chloride solution 
(Ghurye, Clif ford, & Tripp, 1999) . 
The initial cost of constructing these removal systems can range from $350 to $1000 per 
resident. Annual operating costs depend on the concentration of the contaminants in raw 
water, the flow rate of water treated, maintenance cost s, and chemicals costs (Eisenberg & 
Middlebrooks, 2013) . In addition to the costs, reverse osmosis  systems need special 3 
 
` expertise for operation and maintenance, that might be problematic in plenty of the rural 
areas (Pirsaheb, Khosravi, Sharafi, & Mouradi, 2016) . 
Nitrate decomposition can also be done through chemical processes. Metals such as z ero-
valent iron (ZVI), zinc, chromium, cadmium, aluminum and lead can chemically reduce 
nitrate in the groundwater (Huno, Rene, van Hullebusch, & Annachhatre, 2018) . Nanoscale 
ZVI (nZVI) is found to be the most attractive metal for denitrification due to its high 
specific surface area and surface reactivity (Peng e t al., 2015) . Due to its electron donation 
properties nZVI acts as denitrification agent in this process and reduces nitrate to 
ammonium. Although it is a fast process, there are some limitations associated with nitrate 
reduction  by ZVI. The formation o f iron oxides on the surface of ZVI at high pH condition 
may inhibit the further reduction of nitrate. Moreover, the end reduction product of this 
process is mainly ammonium, which itself would be of concern (Y. Liu & Wang, 2019) . 
Biological processes have been applied to remove nitrate from contaminated water. Many 
bacteria are capable of reducing nitrate to nitrogen  gas. Most denitrifying bacteria are 
heterotrophic and use organic substances (e.g. methanol, ethanol, methane) as electron 
donors to convert nitrate to nitrogen (Sharma & Sobti, 2012) . In a natural heterotrophic 
reactive media, dissolved organic carbon in pore waters of the aquifer is used for 
denitrification proce ss. In such environment, the organic carbon insufficiency may limit 
the denitrification rate (Huno et al., 2018) . 
Using microalgae can be a sustainable and effective approach for biological treatment of 
groundwater.  Algae can uptake nitrate and herbicides and create biomass that concentrates 
the nitrogen and leaves the water with l ower  level of nitrate (Wick et al., 2012) . 4 
 
` To overcome the complications of using suspended algae, microal gae can be used in 
immobilized form. Immobilization of algae in polymeric matrices make s them easier to 
handle and can be used repeatedly for product generation. It allows higher cell densities 
and easier harvesting of biomass from its liquid environment (De-Bashan & Bashan, 2010) . 
1.2 Research Objectives  
The main goal of this study was to introduce an economical, efficient, and feasible 
alternative technology to remove nitr ate, atrazine and potentially other herbicides of 
environmental concern from waterbodies using immobilized algae. This process will lower 
the health risks associated with high concentration of nitrate and herbicides and will 
produce valuable biomass which can be used as a source of green energy. The development 
of such a system starts from using the ideal conditions in the lab followed by being tested 
using actual water samples.   
The specific objectives of this study are addressed below : 
1. Optimizing an immobilized algae -based biological system for nitrate removal in batch 
reactors. In this phase, the optimum experimental conditions that maximizes the uptake 
rate of nitrate were investigated and used to design the reactors on the next phases . The 
ideal laboratory conditions were  used in this activity. Objective 1 w as completed by 
performing the  following sub -tasks:  
1.1. Examine nitrate removal under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions and 
under various light intensities: To simulate the autotrophic and heterotrophic 
growth of algae, batch studies were  performed with and without addition of an 
organic carbon sour ce. At autotrophic condition, the dissolved atmospheric CO 2 5 
 
` was the only source of carbon. The heterotrophic growth was simulated by adding 
glucose to the bulk solution. The effect of light on the heterotrophic growth of algal 
beads was evaluated by measur ing the nitrate uptake rate and dry cell weight of the 
algae in complete darkness, medium and high intensity light.  
1.2. Optimize the required algal beads in batch  reactor for nitrate removal: Four 
different ratios of algal beads / water (50%, 25%, 12.5%,  and 6.25% by volume) 
were evaluated for their nitrate removal efficiency from synthetic contaminated 
ground water.  
1.3. Test the performance efficiency of two algae species ( Chlorella sorokiniana  
vs Scenedesmus species) for nitrate reduction  
2. Evaluating different reactors configuration (sequencing batch and continuous flow 
reactor) for the removal of nitrate and atrazine from synthetic groundwater. The Kinetics 
and rates obtained from objective 1 were  used to develop the different reactor 
configurations  studied  in objective 2.  
Objective 2 was completed by performing the  following sub -tasks:  
2.1. Evaluate the performance of nitrate removal under sequential batch conditions 
and with different ratios of algae: alginate. In this sub -task, sets of experiments with 
four different ratios of algae to alginate (75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 10:90 (v:v %)), 
were performed to assess the minimum number of initial algae needed without 
compromising the performance.  
2.2. Evaluate the removal of nitrate and atrazin e in continuous flow conditions and 
under temperature variation. The immobilization system that was optimized in 6 
 
` objective 1 was tested in continuous flow mode and in two different temperatures 
(20 and 35 °C) to evaluate the stability and steadiness of the  system.  
3. Evaluating the performance of the algal -based biological system in real working 
scenarios, by utilizing actual water samples collected from sites with high concentration of 
nitrate and agricultural residue herbicides. Actual water samples, obta ined from Wahoo 
creek, the water treatment utilities  in Hastings, NE,  and Rockford lake were utilized to 
evaluate the system performance under real working scenarios. The experiments listed in 
each sub -task were performed in continuous flow mode:  
3.1. Eval uate the performance of the immobilized system in nitrate removal using 
actual groundwater, collected from the Hastings water treatment utilities  
3.2. Evaluate the performance of the system in removing nitrate and herbicides 
from actual surface water, coll ected from Wahoo Creek, NE.  
3.3. Evaluate the performance of the system in removing nitrate and herbicides

4. Utilization of nanoclay embedded algal beads as a combin ed physical -biological 
approach for maximizing the uptake of nitrate and atrazine from synthetic and actual 
groundwater. Nanoclay  material  was chosen for use was treated with 25 -30% w/w 
trimethyl stearyl ammonium (TMSA). This modification was done in order  to produce 
cations on the surface of the clay and add a positive surface charge to it. The overall positive 
charge resulting from this modification likely facilitated adsorption of the negatively - 7 
 
` charged nitrate ions on the surface of the nanoclay and , hence,  increase d the nitrate uptake 
rate.  
The following sub -tasks were performed here:  
4.1. Optimize the concentration of nanoclay inside of the beads to maximize nitrate 
uptake: To assess the impact of nanoclay dosage on the performance of the algal 
beads , the beads w ere embedded with nanoclay in different concentrations ( 0.0030 
to 0.60 mg per bead) and tested for nitrate uptake.  
4.2. Examine the effect of TMSA on algal cells and nitrate removal rate: To assess 
the toxicity of TMSA on the immobilized algal  cells and investigate the mechanism 
of nitrate uptake on activity 4.1, the algal beads were  embedded with TMSA and 
tested for nitrate uptake.  
4.3. Examine the efficiency of the nanoclay based immobilized system on the 
removal rate of nitrate and atrazine using synthetic and actual groundwater .

APPLICATION OF IMMOBILIZED ALGAE IN WATER AND WASTEWATER 
TREATMENT1  
2.1 Introduction  
Immobilization is defined as a technique that restricts the mobility of cells by entrapping 
them within a polymer matrix or attaching them to a solid support (Razavi -Shirazi, 2002) . 
Immobilization of the cells have advantages over free suspended cells: 1) immobilization 
facilitates harvesting biomass at the end of the process, 2) immobilized cells require smaller 
space and are easier to handle than free cells, and 3) immobilization protects the cells 
against harsh environments, such as toxicity, salinity, and pH (E. Eroglu et al., 2012) . A 
suitable immobilization matrix provides a structure with clefts or holes in which the 
microorganism can take hold and be protected from exposure to the contaminated and/or 
harsh environm ent. This way, the microorganism can tolerate higher concentrations of the 
contaminants since they are not in direct contact with them. The matrix does not need to 
provide any nutrients for the microorganism (Razavi -Shirazi, 2002) . 
The immobilized algal cells have various applications, including nutrients removal from 
water and wastewater (Fares A AlMomani & Örmeci, 2016) , biosorption of heavy metals 
from wastewater (Blanco, Sanz, Llama, & Serra, 1999) , removal of organic pollutants from 
wastewater (Zümriye Aksu, 2005) , and biofuel production (Chevalier & de la Noüe, 1985) . 
Various immobilization techniques and the applications of immobilized algal cells are 
discussed in the following sections o f this chapter.

2.2 Immobilization Techniques  
Immobilization techniques can be classified into two main groups: “passive” and “active”. 
Both natural and synthetic materials are used for passive and active immobilization. A good 
carrier must be able to hold th e cells and prevent them from diffusing to the bulk solution. 
It must be porous enough to allow the diffusion of the molecules from bulk solution to the 
cells. For the autotrophic living cells, the carrier must allow sufficient light transmission.  
2.2.1 Passive immobilization  
Passive immobilization involves growing the microorganisms on surfaces due to their 
natural tendency to attach to them (Robinson, Mak, & Trevan, 1986) . This technique is 
simple and cheap; but depends on the physical interaction between th e microorganism and 
the surface of the immobilization agent (Martins, Martins, Fiúza, & Santaella, 2013) . The 
immobilization of microorganisms on properly chosen adsorbents stimulates metabolism 
and preserves their physiological activity (Nikovskaya, 1989) . 
Both natural and synthetic carriers can be used for passive immobilization. Loofa sponge 
is a non -toxic, cheap fiber medium, which has been previously used for immobilization of 
microorganisms. It is derived from the genus luffa. A loofa sponge is a natur al polymer 
with a very low density and very high porosity. This polymer is autoclavable and stable 
over the pH variation (Ogbonna, Liu, Liu, & Tanaka, 1994) . 
The general protocol for immobilization in loofa starts with soaking it in boiling water for 
30 minutes, washing it with tap water, and leaving it in Deionized (D I) water for 24 hours. 
The sponges are then oven -dried at 70 °C, autoclaved, and soaked in a culture medium for 
10 minutes. The loofa sponges are washed at the end in order to remove free cells from 
them (N Akhtar, Iqbal, & Iqbal, 2004) . 13 
 
` The immobilization of blue -green microalgae on the loofa sponge for cadmium biosorption 
has been studied by Saeed and Iqbal (Saeed & Iqbal, 2006) . This immobilized system was 
found effective in increasing the biosorption of cadmium at equilibrium compared to free 
biomass. It was reported that 96% of adsorption occurred within the first 5  minutes and the 
equilibrium was reached after 15  minutes.  
Even  though loofa sponge has the advantages of being cheap, physically strong, and highly 
porous (N Akhtar,  Iqbal, & Iqbal, 2003) , the results of experiments using this carrier are 
not easily repeatable. Because of the variation in the skeleton of the fruits in different 
plants, loofa sponge samples can have different physical characteristics, which makes it  
hard to get consistent results (Lau, Tam, & Wong, 1998) . It was suggested that choosing 
the sponges of similar sizes and structures, such as same diameter  and pore sizes of the 
fibrous network, could help in achieving consistent results (Y.-K. Liu, Seki, Tanaka, & 
Furusaki, 1998) . 
The synthetic materials used for passive immobilization include glass, wood, and plastic. 
Some strains of algae have the tendency to attach to the submerged surfaces.  A stud y 
performed by Danilov and Ekelund (Danilov & Ekelund, 20 01) compared the effectiveness 
of glass slides and tubes, pieces of wood, and pieces of PVC plastic on settlement patterns 
of periphyton  in lakes of different trophic status. It was found that periphyton ’s favorable 
attachment surface is glass tubes; as wood did not adsorb as much algae as glass did, and 
plastics only adsorb bacteria and not algae. In another study, the colonization of periphytic 
algae on glass slides was evaluated within a 5 -week period at four different current 
velocities. It was found that there is an inverse relationship between the accumulation of 
algae and current velocity, as there was more attached biomass in the low -current locations 14 
 
` (Ghosh & Gaur, 1998) . In another study, (Urrutia, Serra, & Llama, 1995)  used 
Scenedesmus obliquus immobilized in pol yvinyl foams to remove nitrate from water. They 
found that the adsorbed cells have a higher growth rate than the cells immobilized by active 
immobilization, details of which are discussed in the subsequent section.  
2.2.2 Active immobilization  
Unlike passive imm obilization, active immobilization techniques do not need the 
microorganisms to be able to naturally attach to a surface. Active immobilization focuses 
on entrapping the cells within a natural or synthetic polymer.  
Entrapment of the cells consists of capt uring the cells in an either natural (agar, alginate, 
and carrageenan) or synthetic (polyurethane, polystyrene, silica gel, polysilicate, and 
polyvinyl alcohol) polymers (De-Bashan & Bashan, 2010) . Flocculation is another form of 
active immobilization that uses chemicals to force the algae to form lumps. Flocculation 
was originally developed to avoid expensive harvesting methods at the end of the treatment 
process. Alkaline flocculants neutralize the negative surface charges of the microalgae and 
allow them to coalesce into a floc. Some of the flocculants,  such as anionic aluminum, can 
be toxic to the microalgae; therefore, natural flocculant agents such as chitosan have been 
used in most studies (Ignacio Moreno -Garrido, 2013) .  
Natural polymers are found to have a higher nutrient diffusion rate and synthetic polymers 
have shown more stability in the wastewater (De-Bashan & Bashan, 2010; Eroglu, Smith, 
& Raston, 2015) . A successful entrapment must allow suitable diffusion of nutrients/ 
products toward and from the immobilized cells (Nirupama Malli ck, 2002) . 
Natural polymers  15 
 
` Sodium alginate (NaC 6H7O6), the salt of alginic acid is one of the most widely used natural 
polymers for algal immobilization. Alginate is extracted from the cells of brown algae (K. 
Y. Lee & Mooney, 2012) . Sodium alginate is very viscous, and it gels when it comes in 
contact with a divalent cation such as calcium ion. The divalent cation provides cationic 
bridges between the guluronic -rich regions of the alginate al ong the biopolymer backbone 
(Sirlei Jaiana Kleinübing, Frederico Gai, Caroline Bertagnolli, & Meuris Gurgel Carlos da 
Silva, 2013) . The typical process of immobilizing cells in alginate matrix includes making 
a 1% –4% alginate solution, mixing it with a concentrated suspension of cells and dropping 
the mixture into a 2% –4% calcium chloride solution (Katırcıoğlu, Aslım, Türker, Atıcı, & 
Beyatlı, 2008; Alejandro Ruiz -Marin, Leopoldo G  Mendoza -Espinosa, & Tom 
Stephenson, 2010) . The main advantage of using alginate as the immobilization agent is 
that the immobilization process does  not impose extreme physical or chemical changes to 
the cells. Further, the permeability and transparency  of the gel provides a very gentle 
environment for the cells to grow (Moreno -Garrido, 2008a) . A scanning electron 
microscope (SEM) image of Scenedesmus sp. microalgae, immobilized in sodium alginate 
matrix, is shown in Figure 2.1.  
‘Green bioprinting’ is a new immobilization process, which has been used to scaffold the 
microalgae immobilized in sodium alginate, using 3D bioprinting (Krujatz et al., 2015) . 
3D bioprinting process was started by preparing 30 g/L sodium alginate solution, followed 
by adding 90 g/L of methylcellulose to it. The mixture was then incubated for 2 hours. The 
incubation process increased the volume of methylcellulose.  The biomass s uspension was 
pelleted before the plotting process and re -suspended in the plotting paste. The mixture of 
microalgae -sodium alginate was then poured into a cartridge, which was connected to the 16 
 
` plotting device. The mixture was dispensed using a 250 μm need le with the pressure of 1.4 
bar. Compared to suspension cultures, 3D immobilized microalgae showed very stable 
growth rates over a wide temperature range ( 26°C, 30°C, or 37°C) . Algal growth was 
reported to be independent of the illumination conditions.  
Agarose ( C24H38O19) is an unbranched polysaccharide, which is extracted from the cell 
walls of some strains of red algae, mainly from the genera Gelidium  and Gracilaria 
(Ignacio Moreno -Garrido, 2013) . Agar has been used to immobilize alg al cells but is best 
known as a thermos -reversible gel. As an immobilizing agent, it has a major drawback. 
Agar melts at 85 °C and solidifies at around 35 °C –40 °C. Therefore, the species should be 
selected carefully for agar immobilization, as a wide vari ety of algae strains cannot resist 
temperatures over 30 °C (Moreno -Garrido, 2008a) . Generally, Cyanophyte can tolerate 
higher temperatures than eukaryotic algae, but temperatures close to 50 °C could damage 
any non -thermophilic species (Ignacio Moreno -Garrido, 2013) . 
Different method s have been used to immobilize algal cells into agar. Agar has been used 
to immobilize Chlorella vulgaris  (C. vulgaris) cells to  remove inorganic ions (NO 3, NO 2, 
PO 4, Cr 2O7) from wastewater. The immobilization was performed by mixing strains of C. 
vulgaris with a 2% (w/v) solution of agar at 35 °C, letting it cool down, and then cutting 
the solidified mixture into 0.3×0.3×0.3 cm pieces. Even though the agar -immobilized cells  
used in this study showed high metal and nutrient -uptake rate, their growth rate was slower 
than the cells immobilized in alginate or carrageenan (N Mallick & Rai, 1994) . 
Agar also has been used to immobilize C. vulgaris  for biosorption of Cu (II). The 
immobilized agar beads in this study were prepared by dropping 2.5% (w/w) agarose 
solution into edible oil at 40 °C. An ice bath was used to drop the  temperature to 15 °C. 17 
 
` The immobilized  C. vulgaris cubes were made by dropping the agarose solution into the 
biomass and gelling the mixture into 3.6 ± 0.2 mm diameter spheres. It was reported that 
the efficiency of the agarose - C. vulgaris beads was lower than calcium -alginate beads in 
metal adsorption. However, there was no assessment on the number of alive cells within 
the beads (Z Aksu, Eğretli, & Kutsal, 1998) . 
Carrageenan is a family of sulphated polysaccharides that are extracted from red algae 
(Rhodophyceae ). Both bacteria and microalgae have been immobilized in carrageenan.  
In one study, three algae strains ( C. vulgaris, Chlorella kessleri  and Scenedesmus 
quadricauda ) were immobilized in carrageenan by mixing the gels with each strain and 
dropping the cells -gel mixtures into a 0.3 M KCl solution (Travieso et al., 1996) . The 
stability of alginate beads was found to be higher than carrageenan; as the carrageenan 
beads partiall y lost their structure after a week of usage.  
Chitosan is a natural polymer, obtained from chitin, an organic non -toxic compound that 
forms the exoskeleton of crustacean and other organisms. Sometimes, it is obtained from 
shrimp shells, which are waste byp roducts in shrimp food industry. The chitosan beads 
were prepared by mixing chitosan flakes with 1% acetic acid at pH 4. The centrifuged 
microalgae solution was added to the chitosan and the mixture of algae -chitosan was 
dropped into a 0.1 M NaOH solution and left in agitation for 3 minutes. The immobilized 
algal beads were picked up from the solution using a strainer (Sashenka Fierro, Maria del 
Pilar Sánchez -Saavedra, & Carmen Copalcua, 2008) . One problem of using chitosan as an 
immobilizing agent is its weak stability. In one study, the high viscosity of chitosan was 
used with konjac flo ur (glucomannan, a dietary fibre, was obtained from the  konjac  plant) 
in order to enhance the stability of immobilized Scenedesmus bicelularis cells. It was 18 
 
` reported that konjac flour did not significantly improve the rheological properties of mixed 
chitos an solutions (Kaya & Picard, 1996) .

Synthetic polymers  
Most synthetic polymers contain compounds that are considered toxic for the living cells; 
therefore, using synthetic polymers in a lgae immobilization might increase the population 
of dead cells. Polyurethane and polystyrene foams, Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), silica gel, 
and polysilicate are the main synthetic polymers used for algal immobilization.  
Polyurethane and polystyrene have been  used to immobilize C. vulgaris, Chlorella kessleri, 
and Scenedesmus quadricauda to remove nutrients from cattle manure (Travieso et al., 
1996) . To make immobilized cells using these synthetic foams, the cubes of polyurethane 
and polystyrene were submerged in microalgae culture and aerated for 10 days. Samples 
of cube s were taken daily and observed under the microscope to assess the colonization 
process and stability of the support media. The effect of using a natural support medium 
19 
 
` (calcium alginate) was compared with polyurethane and polystyrene. It was found that 
polyurethane was a better medium for immobilization in the wastewater, as increasing the 
phosphate concentration in the wastewater caused the destruction of the alginate pellets 
(Travieso et al., 1996) .  
PVA is another synthetic polymer that is used in algal immobilization. PVA has been used 
to immobilize Sargassum bacc ularia.  The immobilization was done by mixing the algae 
suspension with a 15% PVA solution (Hashim, Tan, & Chu, 2000) . The mixture was first 
dropped into boric acid and then into the sodium phosphate solution to solidify. The 
lifetime of the immobilized beads was evaluated in multiple cycles of copper adsorption 
and desorption. Both desorbents (HCl and Ethylenediamine tetr aacetic acid  (EDTA)) used 
in this study were effective in stripping the adsorbed copper from the immobilized biomass 
over five cycles. However, the copper uptake in Cycles 2 –5 was lower than that in Cycle 
1, confirming that the desorbing agents decrease th e lifetime of the immobilized biomass 
in multiple cycles of adsorption –desorption (Hashim et al., 2000) . 
Silica gel (SiO 2) is a porous synthetic polymer, which is produced from sodium silicate. 
Silica gel is a suitable matrix for algal immobilization because of its high porosity and 
adsorption capacity (Ignacio Moreno -Garrido, 2013) .  
(Carrilho, Nóbrega, & Gilbert, 2003)  immobilized brow n alga  Pilayella littoralis  on silica 
gel. 40 mg of powdered algae and 100 mg of silica gel were mixed and dried at 80  °C for 
20 minutes. A few drops of DI water was added to make an algae -silica paste and the paste 
was dried again at 80  °C for 20 minutes.  To achieve a better immobilization, the 
wetting/drying process was repeated 3 –5 times. The final dried silica -algae was then sieved 
to discard the non -immobilized biomass.  20 
 
` A different approach was followed by (Rangsayatorn, Pokethitiyook, Upatham, & Lanza, 
2004) . The immobilization process started with mixing o ne gram of cyanobacterial cells 
(dry weight equivalent ) with 25 ml of 6% sodium silicate solution, and 25 ml of DI water. 
The procedure was followed by adding the mixture to 20 ml of 18% HCl to form the gel. 
The gel was cut, and the immobilized particles w ere washed, and dried at 80 °C.  
The procedure for immobilization of microalgae in polysilicate polymer has been described 
previously by (Stark & Rayson , 2000) . The process was done by adding the biomass to a 
6% Na 2SiO 4·5H 2O solution at a pH of 2.0. The incremental addition of the  Na2SiO 4·5H 2O 
was continued until the pH increased to 7.0. The mixture was then washed with DI water 
and baked overnight at 80 °C.  
Due to the high temperature applied in these techniques, no living algal cells remain within 
the immobilization matrix (Ignacio Moreno -Garrido, 2013) . 
In a very recent study, the efficiency and stability of the bacteria entrapped within the Silica 
High Internal Phase Emulsion [Si(HIPE)] shell were investigated (Roucher et al., 2018) . 
The Si(HIPE) beads were synthesized by adding 5.02 g of Tetraethyl -ortho -silane (TEOS) 
to 16.02 g of an aqueous solution of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromid e (TTAB) 
(35%). 5.88 g of 37% HCl solution was then added to the mixture and left under stirring 
for 5 minutes. Later, 35 g of dodecane was added to the mixture and transferred drop by 
drop to polydimethylsiloxane oil to form droplets. The droplets were le ft at room 
temperature for 3 days to form the Si(HIPE) beads.  
The Si(HIPE) beads were sterilized and transferred to M9 medium and left under static 
vacuum for 3 days to get prepared for microbial colonization. To colonize the beads with 
E. coli bacteria, one colony was inoculated into a flask containing M9 medium and 21 
 
` chloramphenicol. The flask was then placed in an incubator overnight until an optical 
density (OD 600) of 0.6 was achieved. The Si(HIPE) beads were then placed into the culture 
medium  for bacterial colonization. The incubation was continued overnight at 25 °C. 
Finally, a sodium silicate shell was synthesized to confine bacteria inside the Si(HIPE) 
beads. The sodium silica shell was prepared using Phosphate -buffered saline (PBS) and 
200 mM of sodium silicate solution which were acidified with HCl to the pH to 7. The 
bacteria beads were added to the solution and agitated until the gelation started. To check 
the stability of the bacteria entrapped in the silica shell, Si(HIPE) beads were o bserved for 
bacteria leakage over a period of 6 days. After 3 days, the leakage was only observed for 
one bead, and 75% of the beads kept their impermeability. After 6 days, the leakage was 
observed for 50% of the beads, which gave the silica coating the h alf-life of 6 days. On 6th 
day, the beads were all crushed on agar plate and large amounts of colonies were observed, 
which indicated the bacteria viability after 6 days of immobilization in the silica shell.  
All the preparation methods are summarized in Table 2.1.

2.3 Culti vation Methods and Application of Immobilized Algae  
As a sustainable treatment system, immobilized algal beads have been widely used to 
remove nutrients (nitrate and phosphate), metals, and organic compounds from water and 
wastewater. Depending on the alga e strain, there are three main cultivation modes which 
can be used for immobilized algal beads: photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic 
growth (Jinghan Wang, Haizhen Yang, & Feng Wang, 2014) . Generally, microalgae 
perform photosynthesis by fixing dissolved carbon dioxide and absorbing light. Therefore, 
they are considered photoautotro phs. Some strains of microalgae, however, use organic 
compounds as their carbon and energy sources without depending on light as their source 
of energy. They are called heterotrophic algae. During heterotrophic growth, assimilation 
of organic carbon genera tes energy by oxidative phosphorylation, followed by 
consumption of oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Hence, heterotrophic growth is an 
aerobic process (Perez -Garcia & Bashan, 2015) . 
Mixotrophic growth is another form of cultivation where the algae uses both inorganic and 
organic carbon sources in the presence of light (Kang et al., 2004) . Mixotrophic algae 24 
 
` strains are more flexible because they gather both carbon and energy through organic or 
inorganic sources and light, simultaneously (Perez -Garcia & Bashan, 2015) . 
Depending on the algae strain, the three mentioned cultivation modes can be used with 
immobilized algae. However, heterotrophic growth is an easier choice, especially on a large 
scale, as it does not have the complicatio ns of light availibility. Heterotrophic cultivation 
of algae makes the process cheaper and simpler to construct (Octavio Perez -Garcia, 
Froylan ME Escalante, Luz E de -Bashan, & Yoav Bashan, 2011) . 
2.3.1  Nutrient Removal  
One of the challenges facing microalgae -based biological treatment system is the loss of 
biomass in a continuous flow bioreactor. Another problem which makes the system 
economically unfavorable is the high costs of harvesting biomass at the end of the trea tment 
process, which needs either centrifugation or filtration. Immobilization techniques solve 
both problems. Most immobilization techniques that are used to immobilize bacteria can 
also be adapted for algae (Ignacio Moreno -Garrido, 2013) . Microalgae cultivation in 
wastewater has been an alternative system for biological wastewater treatment, as it has 
the advantages of removing nutrients and producing biomass. Microalgae can grow rapidly 
and remove nutrients from wastewater, and the remaining biomass can be used to produce 
algal metabolites or biogas (Delgadillo -Mirquez, Lopes, Taidi, & Pareau, 2016) .  
Strains of S. obliquus  and C. vulgaris immobilized in sodium alginate have been used in 
batch and semi -continuous modes to remove nutrients from urban wastewater (Alejandro 
Ruiz -Marin et al., 2010) . The immobilized S. obliquus  were found more efficient in 
ammonia removal from urban wastewater and they grew faster than  C. vulgaris  treating 
urban and/or artifi cial wastewater; thus, suggesting that  S. obliquus  could be a suitable 25 
 
` choice to design semi -continuous bioreactors.  Compared to C. vulgaris, S. obliquus  was 
able to remove nitrogen and phosphorous for longer periods (181 hours), as explained in 
Table 2.2. 
In another study, the growth rate and nutrient removal efficiency of Scenedesmus 
intermedius  and Nannochloris sp. isolated from pig manure and immobilized in calcium 
alginate were evaluated (Jimenez -Perez, Sanchez -Castillo, Romera, Fernandez -Moreno, & 
Pérez -Martınez, 2004) . Nitrate and phosphate removal efficiency of free cells were found 
to be higher than immobilized cells. Phosphate and nitrate removal rates, using species 
isolated from wastewater, were higher than the rates obtained with commercial species. 
Since the isolated species were adapted to high -nutrient concentrations they were better 
candidates for nutrient removal.  
Immobilized algal cells can also be used as an alternative system for the biological 
treatment to remove nitrate from groundwater (Carlos Garbisu, Gil, Bazin, Hall , & Serra, 
1991) . The nitrate uptake of Phormidium laminosum  cells, immobilized in polyurethane  
foam from water was studied in batch and continuous flow reactors (Carlos Garbisu et al., 
1991) . Entrapment in PU matrix was found to be toxic to the cells and caused the death of 
the immobilized cells. Therefore, the experiments were performed by adsorbing the cells 
onto PU foams. In this study, chlorophyll was used as an indicator of algal biomass. The 
immobilized P. laminosum  cells removed 1.1 µMmg-1chl h-1 of nitrate while the free cells 
were able to uptake nitrate at 2.6 µMmg-1chl h-1. The lower rate of nitrate uptake in 
immobilized cells was reported to be due to the limitation in diffusion of nutrients into the 
cells.  26 
 
` Mats of electrospun chitosan nanofibers were also found to be effecti ve in immobilizing 
C. vulgaris , and a durable system for removing nitrate from wastewater. The immobilized 
C. vulgaris mats were able to remove around 87% nitrate from the bulk solution in 15 days 
(initial nitrate concentration was 30 mg/L NO 3-N). It was d iscussed that the nanofiber mat 
in the liquid initiated the removal of nitrate, while the growth of algae subsequently 
consumed the remaining nitrate with a slower rate (E. Eroglu et al., 2012) . 
In another work, the effect of immobilizing Scenedesmus sp.  (strains 1 and 2) and S. 
obliquus cells i n chitosan matrix was evaluated on their viability, growth, and nitrate and 
phosphate uptake.

30% phosphate within 36 hours of treatm ent (Sashenka Fierro et al., 2008) . 
2.3.2 Metal Removal  
Industrial processes are known to release heavy metals in the natural water systems,  which 
increases the concerns about the effects of toxic metal as environmental contaminants 
(Jalali, Ghafourian, Asef, Davarpanah, & Sepehr, 2002) . Many algae species are known to 
have capability to sorb metals, and because of that, there is immense potential for using 
them in wastewater treatment. Algal cells are able  to remove metals from multi -metal 
solutions; and dead cells are reported to be more efficient in metal sorption than live cells 
(Mehta & Gaur, 2005) . Metal uptake by  algal cells can either happen actively 
(bioaccumulation) and/or passively (biosorption) (Jalali et al., 2002) . 
Biosorption of four metals [Cu(II), Fe(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II)] using the strain of P. 
laminosum  immobilized  in polysulphone and epoxy resin was previously evaluated 
(Blanco et al., 1999) . According to this study, the biosorption rate is dependent on the 
wetting of biomass beads, as the ra te of metal biosorption decreased with the use of dry 
biomass beads. Also, using smaller immobilized beads increased the rate of metal 
biosorption. The cells immobilized in polysulphone showed the potential to be reused for 
at least 10 consecutive biosorpt ion/desorption cycles without any loss of efficiency after 
reconditioning with 0.1 M solution of NaOH.  
 In anot her study, biosorption of nickel on free (live and dead) and immobilized dead C. 
vulgaris cells and blank alginate beads was evaluated (Al-Rub, El -Naas, Benyahia, & 
Ashour, 2004) . The results indicated that immobilization increases the nickel removal 
because of the surface sorption contribution by the beads. The blank alginate beads resulted 28 
 
` in higher nickel removal than the free algal cells, which was another indicator that 
immobilization enhanced nickel sorption.  
Another study was conducted to inves tigate the biosorption mechanism of radioisotopes of 
metals (60Co, 54Mn and 65Zn) using Chlorella salina  immobilized in calcium -alginate 
matrix. It was found that the accumulation of metal in algae includes a rapid biosorption, 
which does not depend on tem perature, light, or metabolic inhibitor, followed by a slower 
accumulation, which is dependent on the cellular metabolism (Moreno -Garrido, 2008a) .  
One suitable tool to select the metal -tolerate algae strains is isol ating them from the 
polluted water. The strain of Anacystis nidulans , isolated from polluted waters, was able to 
grow in a medium containing Cr with the maximum concentration of 100 μM (Khattar, 
Sarma, & Singh, 1999) . 
In another study, the efficiency of the Chlorella sorokiniana  (LSIBCS), isolated from 
wastewater  and immobilized in loofa sponge , was investigated in removing Cr (III) from 
aqueous solution. Comparing the  biosorption capability of the free biomass of  C. 
sorokiniana  (FBCS) and LSIBCS showed 17.79% increase in the uptake when the algal 
cells were used in immobilized form. The highest  biosorption  rate for FBCS and LSIBCS 
were reported to be 58.80  and 69.26  mg Cr(III)/g biosorbent, respectively (Nasreen Akhtar, 
Iqbal, Zafar, & Iqbal, 2008) . Table 2.3 summarizes the results on metal removal from the 
previous studies.  
2.3.3 Organic Compounds Removal  
In recent years, the amount of hazardous organic compounds being discharged into the 
environment has increased (Zümriye Aksu, 2005) . Some strains of microalgae can 
biodegrade hazardous organic pollutants, as shown in Table 2.4 . 29

Akhtar et

Dried  C. vulgaris  has been used for biosorption of three vinyl sulphone type reactive dyes: 
Remazol Black B (RB), Remazol Red RR (RR) and Remazol Golden Yellow RNL (RGY) 
in batch reactor. It was found that the dye sorption was highly dependent on the pH and 
temperature. Th e optimum pH was 2 and the temperature was found to impact on the 
process in an inversely proportional way. The maximum biosorption capacity occurred at 
35 °C for RB and at 25  °C for RR and RGY (Zümriye Aksu & Tezer, 2005) . 
The capability of Prototheca zopfii , immobilized in polyurethane was evaluated in 
degradation of n -alkanes. Immobilization of  P. zopfii  in polyurethane cubes improved the 
volumetric biodegradation rate of hydrocarbons compared to the ones with free and 
alginate -immobilized cells. The improvement in removal rate was due to the affinity of 30 
 
` algal cells to the substrates in the foam cubes, hy drophobic interaction between the foam 
cubes and the substrate, and cell attachment to the foam cubes due to the hydrophobic 
interaction (Yamaguchi, Ishida, & Suzuki, 1999) .

In another study, oil -degrading yeast cells,  Yarrowia lipolytica  180 immobilized in 
polyurethane foam (PUF) were used to absorb and degrade oil on water surface (Oh, 
Maeng, & Kim, 2000) . PUF -immobilized cells were capable of absorbing crude oil  up to 31 
 
` 7–9 times their own weight. The immobilized cells showed high floatability in seawater . 
Less than 5% of the absorbed oil was released from the beads when they were left on the 
water for more than 10 days (Oh et al., 2000) .  
In another work, a biological permeable barrier medium was designed to remove 2,4,6 -
trichlorophenol (TCP) from groundwater (Razavi -Shirazi & Veenstra, 2000) . PVA -
immobilized activated sludge cells were found to be a successful permeable barrier. They 
removed 99.9% and 91% TCP, at loading rates of 300 and 600 mg/L -d with c orresponding 
hydraulic retention times of 24.5 and 12.3 minutes, respectively. The immobilized cells 
stayed permeable during 166 days of continuous reactor experiments.  
2.4 Conclusion s  
This chapter summarized the fundamentals and recent research advances of the microalgae 
immobilization techniques with examples of their application in water and wastewater 
treatment. The following are the conclusions drawn from this section:  
1. Natural polymers are found to have a higher nutrient diffusion rate and  synthetic 
polymers have shown more stability in the wastewater. Among the immobilization carriers, 
alginate is the most suitable one as it’s permeable and transparent enough for light and 
nutrient diffusion, has high stability and does  not impose extreme physical or chemical 
condition changes to the cells.  
2. Heterotrophic growth is the most suitable choice for algae cultivation, as it doesn’t have 
the complications of light availibility and makes the process cheaper and simpler to 
operate.  
3. Immobilizat ion of microalgae is a sustainable technique to remove nitrate, phosphate, 
organic pollutants ( Dyes, n -alkanes, crude oil and TCP) and metals (Cu, Fe, Ni, Zn, Co, 32 
 
` Mn, Cr)  from water and wastewater. When used in wastewater treatment, choosing species 
isolat ed from wastewater will enhance the pollutants removal rate.

DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF BATCH AND SEQUENCING 
BATCH REACTORS FOR NITRATE REMOVAL FROM  GROUNDWATER2 
 
3.1 Abstract  
The treatment efficiency of Chlorella  sorokiniana  and Scenedesmus  species , immobilized 
in sodium alginate was evaluated for removing nitrate from groundwater. The experiments 
were performed initially in batch mode and the best -performing conditions were replicated 
in sequencing batch reactor mode. S. sp.  showed a higher nitrate  uptake in short term than 
C. sorokiniana . Immobilized S. sp.  and C. sorokiniana  cells showed 90% nitrate removal 
in 9 and 12 days, respectively. The optimal ratio of algal beads/water was found to be 
12.5% (v:v). Comparatively, suspended S. sp.  cells were  able to remove only up to 35% of 
nitrate in 8 days. Alginate immobilized S. sp.  beads were capable of uptaking nitrate for 
100 consecutive days in sequencing batch reactor mode. When tested in actual 
groundwater, 90% of nitrate was eliminated in 2 days wi thout need for any additional 
carbon source. Immobilized algal beads can be a low -cost alternative technique to remove 
nitrate from groundwater as they are water -insoluble, non -toxic, easy to harvest and offer 
high removal efficiency.  
3.2 Introduction  
 
2 This chapter is based on the publication:  Mollamohammada, S., Aly Hassan, A., & Dahab, M. (2020). 
Nitrate Removal from Groundwater Using Immobilized Heterotrophic Algae.  Water, Air, & Soil 
Pollution , 231(1), 1 -13. 38 
 
` Nitrate is the most common contaminant in the groundwater’s aquifers (Wheeler, Nolan, 
Flory, DellaValle, & Ward, 2015) . About 21% of public water supply and 98% of self -
supplied water in 2010 was e xtracted from groundwater (Survey, 2010) . The extensive use 
of nitrate based fertilizers is the largest contributor to nitrate contamination, therefore , the 
highest concentration of nitrate in groundwater has been observed in agricultural areas 
(Fields, 2004; Lawniczak et al., 2016) . US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) 
has set a maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mg/l  NO 3-N for nitrate. (Agency, 
2018) . Exposure to drinking water with a nitrate level above the MCL is a potential health 
risk for infants and sometimes, for adults. Methemoglobinemia, which is the result of 
nitrate reduction to nitrite  in infants’ digestive system is reported to be common between 
infants who have consumed water with elevated levels of nitrate (M. Liu, Liu, Bawa, & 
Chen, 2012) . Moreover, exposure to drinking water contaminated with nitrate and atrazine, 
a type of herbicide used as weed killer, is reported as a pot ential health risk, because it can 
form nitrosamine. Nitrosamine can increase the risk of developing Non -Hodgkin 
Lymphoma (Rhoades et al., 2013b) . 
Reverse osmosis (RO) and ion exchange are generally conside red to be the best available 
nitrate treatment technologies, however, they are associated with high capital and operating 
costs. Furthermore, RO membranes retain nitrate and other contaminants into a 
concentrated waste brine that poses a disposal problem (Y. Zhang et al., 20 12) Most 
available ion exchange nitrate removal resins suffer from the inherent natural low 
selectivity for NO 3.  Most anionic resins are more selective for SO 4 (than NO 3) which is 
also a common groundwater constituent; usually in higher concentrations than NO 3. 39 
 
` Therefore, there is a need to find an economical, sustainable water treatment technique 
which can diminish the nitrate concentration.  
Microalgae treatment is a sustainable and effective approach for the removal of nitrate from 
groundwater. Algae is capable of uptaking nitrate and creating biomass that concentrates 
the nitrogen.  Strains of Chlorella vulgaris  and Scenedesmus sp. have already shown 
promising results in nitrate removal as immobilized and free cells in wastewater (F. A. 
AlMomani & & Örmeci, 2016) . However, designing an effective algae photobioreactor is 
challenging because of the biomass loss in a continuous flow reactor and the difficulty in 
harvesting algal biomass at the end of treatment process. Algal biomass harvesting requires 
expensive centrifuging and filtration operations (I. Moreno -Garrido, 2013) . Thus, the 
immobilization approach of microalgae into polymeric matrices will help solve both 
problems.  Immobilized algal cells occupy smaller space and are easier to handle. The 
immobilization of algae facilitates the harvesting of biomas s and protects the cells from the 
harsh environments (e.g. metal toxicity, pH and salinity) (E. Eroglu, Agarwal, V. et al., 
2012) . 
Both synthetic and natural polymers can be used as immobilization agents (Moreno -
Garrido, 2008a) . Alginate is the most widely used polymer for immobilization of 
microalgae; as it is a non -toxic, transparent polymer. Transparency of the alginate matrix 
allows light transmission which i s a critical factor for photosynthesis in autotrophic cells 
(Hatanaka et al., 1999; Seli moglu & Elibol, 2010) . Several studies have used immobilized 
algal cells to remove nutrients from wastewater (M. Liu et al., 2012; Alejandro Ruiz -Marin 
et al., 2010)  . The strains of Scenedesmus obliquus  and Chlorella vulgaris , immobilized in 
sodium alginate were used to remove nutrients from wastewater in batch and semi -40 
 
` continuous modes (Alejandro Ruiz -Marin et al., 2010) . S. obliquus was reported as a better 
candidate as it showed higher N and P uptake than C. vulgaris . Additionally, S. obliquus 
was more effective in removing N and P for longer periods in semi -continuous mode than 
in batch cultures.  
Chlorella  vulgaris  and Chlamydomonas  sp., immobilized in calcium alginate were used 
during the tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater. C. vulgaris  was reported as the best 
specie with 72% and 99% of reduction in nitrate and orthophosphate, respectively (Shaker 
et al., 2015) . Chlorella  sp. immobilized in calcium  alginate  sheets  removed  100% of NH 4-
N and P from real domestic secondary  effluents  (E. Zhang et al., 2012) .   
As discussed in chapter 2, there are three main cultivation modes which can be applied for 
immobilized algal beads: Photo -autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic growth (J. 
Wang, H. Yang, & F. Wang, 2014) . Photo -autotrophic microalgae use dissolved carbon 
dioxide and absorb light to perform photosynthesis.  In contrast, heterotrophic growth 
occurs when microalgae perform photosynthesis and use organic carbon as carbon and 
energy sources without the need of light (Perez -Garcia & Bashan, 2015) . Mixotr ophic 
cultivation uses both inorganic and organic carbon sources in the presence of light (Abreu, 
Fernandes, Vicente, Teixeira, & Dragone, 2012) . In autotrophic growth, light penetration 
is inversely proportional to the cell concentration. Therefore, it is more difficult to reach a 
high density of mi croalgae biomass using autotrophic growth. As the cells achieve higher 
density, it gets harder for the light to penetrate the cells. The low biomass concentration in 
autotrophic growth also increases the harvesting cost at the end of the treatment process 
(Liang, Sarkany, & Cui, 2009) . In large scale applications, heterotrophic cultivation is 
cheaper and easier to handle than autotrophic cultivation as it does not have the limitation 41 
 
` of light dependency for growth (O. Perez -Garcia, F. M. Escalante, L. E. de -Bashan, & Y. 
Bashan, 2011) . The microalgae species that undergo heterotrophic growth can grow in light 
limit ed conditions and this can lead to the higher biomass production. Strains of  C. 
sorokiniana  and S. sp.  can produce biomass under autotrophic, mixotrophic, and 
heterotrophic conditions (Di Caprio, Altimari, & Pagnanelli, 2018; Kim, Park, Cho, & 
Hwang, 2013; Rai & Gupta, 2016) . Monosaccharides or organic acids can be used as 
carbon and energy sources in heterotrophic cultivation (Figueroa‐Martinez, Nedelcu, 
Smith, & Reyes‐Prieto, 2015)  . While wastewater treatment using immobilized algae was 
previously reported, there are no reported studies on heterotrophic growth of immobilized 
microalgae to treat nitrate -contaminated groundwater. In this chapter, both batch and 
sequencing batch growth  studies were conducted to develop and optimize an immobilized -
based biological treatment system and evaluate the treatment efficiency of C. sorokiniana  
and S. sp.  immobilized in sodium alginate for removing nitrate from groundwater.  
3.3 Materials and Methods  
3.3.1 Cultivation of algae and preparation of immobilized algal beads  
Stock cultures of C. sorokiniana  and S. sp.  were obtained from the Biochemistry 
Department at the University of Nebraska -Lincoln. The composition of the nutrient 
solution is provided elsewhere  (Sorial et al., 1997) . The nutrient solution consist ed of 
essential inorganic salts and vitamins necessary to grow micro -organisms: B+3, Ca+2, Cl−, 
Co+2, CU+2, Fe+3, K+, Mg+2, Mn+2, Mo+6, NH 4−, Na+, SO 4−2, Zn+2, p-aminobenzoic acid, 
biotin, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, nicotinic acid, panothenic acid, pyriodoxine 
hydrochloride, riboflavin, thiamin hydrochloride and thioctic acid concentration. In 
additio n, a nutrient spike solution (0.29 mM NaNO 3 and 0.03 mM NaH 2PO 4·H2O) was 42 
 
` added to the feed solution to achieve the target of 50 mg/L nitrate. The algal solution was 
kept at room temperature. Both artificial plant light and sunlight were used for algal grow th 
and the intensity of light was ranged between 500 -700 Lux.  
Microalgae was cultivated in a 3 -gallon container using bulk media solution. After 
approximately two weeks of cultivation, the algae were ready to be used for bead 
preparation, when the turbidit y reached 30 NTU. To prepare alginate -algae beads, algae 
solution was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and 
the algal cells were resuspended in DI water to obtain a concentrated solution. All the 
growth medium nutrients  used to cultivate microalgae, except nitrate, were added to the 
algae concentrated suspension. Next, the concentrated algae solution was mixed with 1.5% 
sodium alginate solution. The mixture was dropped into a 2% calcium chloride solution 
using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, model 55 -3333) and left overnight to form algal 
beads. The algal beads were uniform and had the diameter of 2.6 mm. The beads were 
rinsed and kept in DI water before being used for the experiments.  
The water matrix used in all bat ch and sequencing batch experiments - except the one with 
actual groundwater - was DI water, containing 10 mg/L NO 3-N. Potassium Nitrate (99.9%, 
Sigma Aldrich) was used and the concentration of NO 3-N in all reactors was measured 
using UV -vis spectrophotomete r (Spectronic, model Genesys 5). The actual groundwater 
sample used at the final stage of the experiments was collected from a pump station at city 
of Hasting, NE. The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in each reactor was measured 
on daily basis, usin g DO meter (YSI, model 5100). A pH meter (Thermo Scientific, model 
Orion 3 -star) and a conductivity meter (Hach, model HQ14D) were used to record pH and 
conductivity daily. The COD of the bulk solution was measured using TNT -plus vial tests 43 
 
` (Hach, TNT820).  GE plant light kits were used as light sources. The intensity of light was 
measured using a digital light meter (Leaton, model 935976) and maintained between 780 -
1000 lux.  
3.3.2 Viability and growth assessment  
An assessment of the viability of algal cells within the beads was performed by observation 
of algal colonies under Ti -S Inverted Fluorescence  microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). The 
chloroplast in algae contains chlorophylls, which are light harvesting mole cules, embedded 
in the thylakoid membrane. The emission spectrum of chloroplasts show strong 
autofluorescence in red, with a peak at 680 nm (Kodama, 2016) . The microscopic images 
were used to isolate the live algal cells from the background using the col or threshold 
function in ImageJ v 1.51 j8.  The total area covered in red was recorded as population of 
live cells.  
Detailed images of the beads were taken using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). SEM 
images were acquired using a Nova Nano SEM 450 (FEI, Hi llsboro, OR), with the voltage 
ranging between 2 to 5 kV. The air -dried algal beads were coated with a thin layer of gold 
before imaging.  
The dry cell weight (DCW) measurements were performed in sequencing batch reactors to 
determine the density and growth  rate of algal cells inside of the beads. Five beads from 
each reactor were dissolved in 5 ml of 4% sodium bicarbonate solution. The suspension 
was then filtered through a 3 -μm (pore size) filter paper, leaving a layer of microalgae on 
the paper. The dry w eight of the microalgae was measured after drying the filter paper at 
100°C for 24 hrs.  44 
 
` All batch and sequencing batch studies were performed in 500 mL flasks, containing 400 
ml DI water and 10 mg/L NO 3- N. All required macro - and micro - nutrients were su pplied 
imbedded in the beads. Glucose, when needed, was added at a concentration of 1 25 mg/L. 
For the samples with actual groundwater, no additional nutrients or glucose was provided 
in the bulk solution.  
3.4 Results and Discussion  
3.4.1 Impact of autotrophic vs. heterotrophic conditions on nitrate removal  
To simulate the autotrophic and heterotrophic growth of algae, batch studies were 
performed with and without addition of an organic carbon source. At autotrophic condition, 
75 mL of C. sorokiniana  beads were run f or 34 days without adding any organic carbon 
source. The dissolved atmospheric CO 2 (~ 1.5 g/L) was the only source of carbon. Two 
types of controls were operated simultaneously: one reactor with alginate beads (no 
microalgae) and another reactor containing  only deionized water. At day 34, glucose (125 
mg/L) was added to the bulk solution to facilitate heterotrophic growth. In the first 5 days, 
immobilized C. sorokiniana  beads showed 6.5% Nitrate removal which reached 33% after 
34 days of autotrophic growth.  As shown on Figure 3.1, the removal efficiency increased 
to 36%, only one day after adding glucose to the bulk (day 35) and reached to 82%, at day 
40. Since glucose is the only source of organic carbon in the bulk, the COD concentration 
was used to measure the glucose consumption by algal cells. The change in concentration 
of COD in the solution indicates its complete consumption by algal cells.  
The effect of light on the heterotrophic growth of algal beads was also  evaluated by 
measuring the nitrate uptake rate and DCW in complete darkness, medium (300 Lux) and 45 
 
` high (700 Lux) intensity light. The highest DCW and nitrate uptake was observed in 
presence of high intensity light source.  
Studies on microalgae suggest tha t only two enzymes, nitrate reductase (NR; EC 1.6.6.1 -
3) and nitrite reductase (NiR; EC 1.7.7.1), are responsible to catalyze nitrate to ammonium 
(Fernandez & Galvan, 2007) . Different environmental variables affect nitrate assimilation. 
One of the key factors in nitrate assimilation is the p resence of light, as most algae 
assimilate nitrate faster in the light than in the dark.  Light also has an important effect in 
glucose uptake by microalgae cells. For  Chlorella  cells growing at the presence of glucose, 
the blue end of the visible spectrum controls many of the metabolic reactions (Karlander 
& Krauss, 1966)  The blue light inhibits uptake of glycine, proline, and arginine, but 
activates the nitrate reductant enzymes and therefore, enhances uptake of oxygen and 
nitrate by microalgae (Octavio Perez -Garcia, Froylan ME Escalante, Luz E. de -Bashan, & 
Yoav Bashan, 2011) .  46

(right vertical axis) of the solution over time. At the end of day 34, 50 mg glucose was added to 
each reactor . 
3.4.2 Optimum volume of algal beads needed  
To determine the opt imum algal beads/water ratio that maximizes the nitrate removal rate, 
four different ratios of C. sorokiniana  beads to water (50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.25%) by 
volume were evaluated. A sample containing 50% blank alginate beads was prepared for 
control treatm ents. As shown in Figure 3.2a, the removal of NO 3-N after 16 days in both 
control treatments, with no beads and with blank alginate beads were 28% and 31%, 
respectively. All other bioreactors with microalgae achieved higher removal than the 
control. The average of 50% NO 3-N was removed by immobilized C. sorokiniana  beads in 
the first 5 days which reached the maximum of 99.9% within 16 days. Comparing the  
nitrate removal rate of samples containing different ratio of algae to water indicates that 
using higher volumetric ratio than 12.5% did not result in improved performance. 
47 
 
` Therefore, the ratio of 12.5% was used in the batch reactors on the remaining expe riments . 
Macro - and micro -nutrients required for growth were introduced to the solution only 
through the added bead volume. Since nitrate removal pattern is equal beyond 12.5%, this 
was an indication that this ratio provided sufficient nutrients. The average removal rate for 
the reactor containing 12.5% algal beads was 0.190 mg N/d.  
Figure 3.2b shows the average values of pH, DO and conductivity in the bulk solution for 
each reactor during 16 days of growth. There was a direct relationship between the volume 
of algal beads in the reactors and the pH of the bulk solution. This is explained by 
photosynthesis occurring in presence of increased algal cells numbers. The same trend 
occurred for DO. Since the algal cells had access to both organic carbon source (glucose) 
and inorganic car bon source (carbon dioxide from the air) and they were kept in presence 
of light, we surmise that they switched between autotrophic and heterotrophic growth, 
depending on the energy source (light or glucose) availability. The concentration of glucose 
used in the growth study ( 125 mg/L ) was substantially lower than what was suggested by 
other literatures (5 - 80 g/L) (Sameji ma & Myers, 1958; Shi, Liu, Zhang, & Chen, 1999) ; 
therefore, it is possible that the glucose initiated the heterotrophic growth but was the 
limiting factor for the long -term heterotrophic growth.  
Moreover, there is a direct correlation between the volu me of algal beads and conductivity 
of the bulk solution. The algal beads were kept in CaCl 2 solution overnight to solidify 
before application. By comparing the conductivity of the control treatment (with no 
microalgae or alginate -88 µs/cm ) and the other re actors  (362-1074 µs/cm) , it is evident that 
the high value of conductivity is mostly because of the presence of calcium and chloride 48 
 
` ions. The average concentration of chloride in the batch reactor with 12.5% of algal beads 
was estimated to be 89±2.2 mg/L.  
Figure 3.2c compares the COD consumption vs. time for three of the reactors. The reactors 
containing 6.25% and 12.5% algal beads follow a very similar trend in glucose 
consumption. In the first 48 hours,  about 35% and 45% of the glucose was consumed by 
algal cells in the reactors with 6.25% and 12.5% algal beads, respectively. The reactor with 
25% algal beads, however, had a sharp reduction on day 2. About 65% of the glucose was 
consumed at the first 48 h ours by algal cells in this reactor. At the last four days (days 5 -
9), the glucose concentration stayed almost constant indicating algae switching from 
heterotrophic to autotrophic mode.

` 3.4.3 Chlorella sorokiniana  vs. Scenedesmus species , effect of starvation and 
immobilization  
Comparing the strains of C. sorokiniana  and S. sp.  indicates that immobilized S. sp.  were 
slightly better than C. sorokiniana in nitrate removal ( Figure 3.3). Consequently, S. sp.  
were further used in the sequencing batch reactor evaluation.  S. sp.  beads removed 60% 
of NO 3 after five days and 90% of NO 3 was eliminated in nine days. For C. sorokiniana , 
the removal rate was 58% in five days and 78% in nine days.  
Moreover, the effec t of starvation on nutrient removal was evaluated. S. sp. beads were 
stored without nutrients for 6 days until their utilization in bioreactors. While there was an 
increase in DO concentration and pH levels for both starved and non -starved S. sp.  cells, 
the rate of increase (in both DO and pH) was higher in non -staved cells; which was an 
indicator of increased levels of photosynthesis occurred in cells without any starvation 
period. Between the biological compounds, RNA, DNA, and protein are indicators of 
physiological status due to their direct relationship to cell division and growth. Positive 
correlations between the ratio of RNA/DNA and growth rate have been obtained in a 
variety of organisms; such as microbial communities, natural and synthesized 
phytop lankton populations (Berdalet, Latasa, & Estrada, 1994) . S. sp.  is one of the 
microalgae species with the ability to produce and accumulate triglyceride (TAG) under 
nitrogen starvation conditions (Breuer, Lamers, Martens, Draaisma, & Wijffels, 2012) . 
Under limited nitrogen conditions, the rate of DNA, RNA and chlorophyll production is 
impaired. As a result, less electrons are generated by phot osynthesis which will mostly be 
used to produce TAG (Breuer, Lamers, Martens, Draaisma, & Wijffels, 2013) . As shown 
in Figure 3.4 the starvation did not improve the nitrate removal rate. N - starvation was 51 
 
` studied in Heterocapsa sp., grown in batch cultures, and it was reported that RNA was 
markedly impacted by N -starvation cells in the intermediate and stationary phases. The N -
starved treatments also resulted in a remarkable decrease in the net photosynthetic rate and 
chlorophyll cont ent per cell which could be the main reason of deterring performance of 
the starved immobilized cells (Berdalet et al., 1994) . 
 
Figure 3.3 Nitrate concentrations present in the solution over time in presence of immobilized C. 
sorokiniana, S. sp. beads, and suspended S. sp. . 
Nitrate removal by suspended algal culture was compared to immobilized cultures. The 
same mass of algae was used in bot h conditions. The nitrate removal rate for suspended 
and immobilized culture was the same at day 1 as seen in Figure 3.3. In the next 7 days, 
however, the nitrate uptake by immobilized cells was significantly higher than it was by 
the suspended culture. Suspended S. sp. cells were able to remove 58% of nitrate in 8 days 
whereas the immobilized beads reached 80% removal rate during the same time. Higher 
52 
 
` rate of nitrate removal by immobilized cells could be explained by higher light intensity 
reaching the algal cell. For suspended cultures, as biomass density increases, the light 
penetration depth will decrease. This will result in smaller percentage of alg al cells being 
effectively illuminated (J. F. Wang, Liu, & Liu, 2015) . An overall light penetration 
throughout the reactor was estimated for both immobilized and suspended cultures. For the 
immobilized cells at day 0, 44% of the li ght penetrated the entire dimeter of the 
photobioreactor vs. 42% measured for the suspended cells. On day 8, these values changed 
to 35% and 20% for immobilized cells and suspended cultures, respectively. Light intensity 
and distribution inside the immobil ized cells were not quantified

` 3.4.4 Nitrate removal in a sequencing batch reactor  
While nitrate was successfully removed in batch reactors, it was essential to know how 
many cycles, the beads could be reused for water treatment. Therefore, the bead lifetime 
was assessed using sequencing batch reactors. Every 9 days, the treated water in  each 
reactor was discarded and the reactors were filled back with 400 ml nitrate -contaminated 
water matrix and 125 mg/L glucose. Besides the nutrients embedded within the beads 
during manufacturing, no additional nutrients were added throughout these expe riments. 
Additionally, four sets of experiments with different ratios of algae to alginate were used : 
75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 10:90 (v:v %), respectively. Different ratios were used to assess 
the minimum number of initial algae needed without compromising  the performance. 
Maintaining high nitrate removal performance with smaller algae concentration results in 
reduced cost for the required initial algae cultivation. Figure 3.5 shows the removal 
efficiency and the performance of the immobilized S. sp.  beads over their lifetime until 
they failed to remove additional nitrate. The ratio of 75:25 (algae: alginate) was 
discontinued as alginate was not sufficien t to support the bead structurally. The higher 
initial algae concentration within the beads (50:50) showed the maximum removal 
efficiency at the first 75 days of operation (periods 1 -7). The performance obtained by the 
25:75 ratio kept improving over time.  The performance is summarized in Figure 3.5 by 
dividing the data in three distinct periods of operation. By period 4, the performance of 
25:75 ratio was almost equal to the 50:50 ratio. Similar performance between both ratios 
was maintained throughout period 6 but 25:75 ratio deteriorated without a known reason 
thereafter. The 10:90 ratio, which  has initially the lowest algae concentration took longer 
time to catch up to the same performance as 50:50 ratio. By period 6, the performance of 54 
 
` 10:90 ratio was comparable to 50:50 ratio and surpassed it by period 8. At period 10, all 
the beads showed a deteriorating performance.  
The initial algal density has a major impact on nutrient removal from water. The higher 
algal density within the beads causes more nutrients as well as glucose assimilation. The 
initial average algal density for the beads with 50 :50, 25:75, and 10:90 ratios were 8.14, 
7.04 and 6.42 mg/L, respectively. Toward the end of the treatment, nitrate removal 
efficiency of the 50:50 ratio beads was lower than that of the 10:90 ratio ( Figure 3.5). It 
was observed that the dense algal mass in the concentrated culture were metabolically less 
active towards the end of the treatment process. The high algal density causes self -shading, 
an accumu lation of auto -inhibitors, which reduces photosynthetic efficiency (Xu, Shen, & 
Chen, 2015) . These results suggest that having a concen trated culture can shorten the 
retention time for nitrate removal and algal cells can be replaced before self -shading 
substances accumulated to a toxic level.

` shows the concentration of different elements in the water matr ix upon the preparation of 
the beads (period 1) and at the end of the treatment process (period 10). As it’s shown, Na, 
Mg, P, K, Ca, Zn and Cu were the dominant elements in the water. The nutrients that were 
added to the algae solution prior to making the  beads include all these elements.  The more 
algae content in the beads means more nutrients and that’s why the highest metal 
concentration is observed in water containing 50:50 ratio beads. Most of these elements 
were partially removed by algal beads at p eriod 10. The only exception was Fe, which was 
not detectable at period 1, but was diffused from the beads to the bulk solution at period 
10. There are also trace amounts of Co, As, Se and Cd in period 1 which were all removed 
at the end of the treatment p rocess (period 10).

` 3.4.5 Algal growth, pH, DO, and reaction rates within beads  
Algal density of immobilized S. sp.  in sequencing batch mode was measured periodically 
using dry cell weight (DCW). Figure 3.6 shows the change within the first two periods. 
The density of the algal cells is gradually increasing over time at the first period (days 0 -
9). The increase of cells density within the beads indicates that algae can still perform 
photosynthesis after immo bilization, which agrees with previous reports of C. vulgaris  
immobilized in alginate (A. Ruiz -Marin, L. G. Mendoza -Espinosa, & T. Stephenson, 
2010) . During the second period (days 9 -17), however, the algal density  increased slightly 
until day 14 after which it remained mostly constant. This indicates that the stationary 
phase of growth was reached. The slight algal density decrease could be explained by 
insufficient nutrients in the bulk solution. At the end of every period of sequencing batch 
operation, treated water was discarded and the beads were washed out. During this process, 
some nutrients that diffused from the beads to the bulk solution were was hed out and never 
recovered.  
Figure 3.7 shows the changes in pH and DO of the bulk solution within selected periods of 
growth studies in sequencing batch mode. As shown, there was a large drop in the 
concentration of DO every week. The color of the beads turned from green at period 1 to 
white at  period 10 . When algal cells photosynthesize, they use carbon source and produce 
oxygen and increase the concentration of DO in the solution. Photosynthesis also increases 
the pH of water as it removes carbon dioxide.

experiments in sequencing batch mode .

` When photosynthesis slows down or stops, both DO, and pH tend to decrease. Therefore, 
the drop in the DO and pH, and change of color are all indicators that photosynthetic rate 
is decreasing in the beads which could be due to nutrient depletion, as it was explained in 
section 3.4. The nitrate uptake in each sequencing batch reactor was simulated using the 
first order reaction kinetics ( ln(C
Co)=−𝑘𝑡). The k value was maximum for the samples 
with 50:50 ratio beads (0.18 1/d) which was an indicator of faster nitrate removal rate by 
them. For the samples with 25:75 and 10:90 ratio beads, the k value was 0.10 and 0.07 
respectively ( Figure 3.8).

covered with live cells was 104,385 pixels initially, 104,411 pixels after 10 days of gr owth, 
75702 pixels after 20 days of growth and 0 pixels after 112 days. The results from 
microscopic images match the algal density results measured by means of DCW (section 
3.3.5).

` Detailed images of the algae within the bead ar e shown through a Scanning Electron 
Microscope (SEM) in Figure 3.10. As shown in Figure 3.10a, sodium alginate matrix is an 
effective support matrix for immobilizing S. sp.  cells, which have the diameter of 3 –4 μm. 
This porous structure of sodium alginate also allows the diffusion of nutrients between the 
bulk liquid and the algae, which allows photosynthesis of algal cells.  
After 112 days of operation, however, sodium alginate matrix lost its firm structure due to 
the loss of the calcium ions in the solution in sequencing batch mode.  Calcium ions provide 
cationic bridges between the guluronic -rich regions along the biopolymer backbone (S. J. 
Kleinübing, F. Gai, C. Bertagnolli, & M. G. C. D. Silva, 2013)  and its depletion damages 
the structure of the beads. At day 112, no algal cells were observed in sodium alginate 
matrix and the beads were surrounded with strains of fungi. As shown in Figure 3.10b, the 
alginate mat became very porous with the diameter of 13 – 20 nm which allowed algal cells 
to escape from the matrix. Fungus are ubiquitous in the environment and the media is a 
great environment for the m to quickly colonize and flourish . In our case, open bottles were 
used as reactors for 112 days which could cause fungus contamination in long term.

3.4.7 The application of actual groundwater  
Immobilized S. sp. were tested using actual groundwater that was collected from wells in 
Hastings, N E. Hasting was chosen because it is experiencing nitrate contamination in its 
water supply aquifer.  About 12% of the municipal wells in Hastings were reported to have 
nitrate concentration above MCL in 2016. High levels of nitrates migrating through the 
aquifer and into the city wells is a potential health risk for people in this town. The 
estimated cost of installing a traditional water treatment facility to eliminate nitrate 
contamination is $75 million. Currently, the city is working closely with water quality 
experts to find a sustainable and efficient solution to reduce the high level of nitrates (City 
of Hastings, 2016)  
Upon collection, the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorous and COD in the groundwater 
sample was measured and found to be 8.9, 2.8 and 100 mg/L, respectively. As shown in 
Figure 3.11, 90% of nitrate was eliminated within two days without adding any external 
carbon source. The groundwater was rich in nutrients described above, which provided a 
more suitable environment for algal cells to grow without needing any additional nutrients/ 
carbon source.  63

3.5 Conclusion s 
In this cha pter, batch experiments were performed to find the optimum conditions for 
nitrate removal from synthetic groundwater. The optimum experimental conditions were 
used to design the sequencing batch reactors and perform the experiments with the actual 
groundwa ter. The following conclusions could be drawn from this study:  
1. The results showed that immobilized S. sp.  beads were more efficient in removing nitrate 
from water than the suspended cell system and can be used up to 100 days in sequencing 
batch mode.  
2. Heterotrophic cultivation of immobilized S. sp.  is an efficient biological method for 
nitrate removal as it exceeds the nitrate uptake rate. The presence of light increases the 
DCW concentration and enhances the nitrate uptake rate in heterotrophic condi tion. 
64 
 
` 3. The Initial algae concentration in the beads is an important factor in nitrate uptake rate.  
Higher algal density in the beads causes more nutrients and glucose assimilation. However, 
the algal beads must be replaced before the self -shading effect  occurs.  
4. Actual groundwater is more suitable for nitrate removal than simulated lab water as it is 
rich in nutrients that facilitate algae growth inside of the immobilization matrix. In natural 
water, no additional carbon source is needed for a successful removal.

IMMOBILIZED ALGAE -BASED TREATMENT OF AGRICULTURALLY 
CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER3 
 
4.1 Abstract  
Scenedesmus  species  algal cells immobilized on alginate gel, were found effective in 
removing nitrate, atrazine, oxadiazon, and triallate  from groundwater in a continuous flow 
reactor .  A hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 7 days was provided in the reactors. The 
experiments with synthetic groundwater were performed at two temperatures (20 and 35 
°C). The uptake rate of nitrate and atrazine were higher at room temperature due to the 
higher algal growth rate. When tested in actual groundwater, 92% of nitrate, 100% of 
magnesium, 99.9% of phosphorus, and 92% of zinc were succ essfully eliminated at the 
end of 29 days treatment operations. The beads removed 100% of oxadiazon and triallate 
in the first 10 days, but some of the herbicides diffused back into the solution toward the 
end of the treatment process.  
4.2 Introduction  
Application of agrochemicals such as fertilizers and herbicides in agriculture has increased 
yield of agricultural crops and minimized the economic losses but at the same time, caused 
environmental contamination (Subashchandrabose, Ramakrishnan, Megharaj, 
Venkateswarlu, & Naidu, 2013) . Excessive application of nitrogen -based fertilizers in

agriculturally contaminated groundwater, Water Environment Research - journal, ( In preparation ).

` agriculture has been the primary reason for high levels of nitrate  in the groundwater 
(Majumdar & Gupta, 2000) . Because of its high solubility in water and low retention by 
soil, nitrate can easily leach to the su bsoil layers and contaminate groundwater.  
Atrazine [6 -chloro -N2-ethyl -N4-isopropyl -1,3,5 -triazine -2,4-diamine] is the most 
common type of herbicide (Hayes et al., 2002) , used to inhibit the photosynthe tic electron 
transport in the weeds (Sene, Converti, Secchi, & S imão, 2010) . Due to the presence of the 
C-Cl linkage, atrazine is a stable compound with a half -life time of 3 -5 years (Bonora et 
al., 2013) . Triallate [N,N -bis (propan -2-yl)[(2,3,3 -trichloroprop -2-en-1-yl) sulfanyl] 
formamide] and oxadiazon [2 -tert-butyl -4-(2,4-dichloro -5-isopropoxyphenyl) -1,3,4 -
oxadiaz olin-5-one] are two other commonly - used herbicides with the same application as 
atrazine. Triallate belongs to thiocarbamate family (Wilson, 1984)  and oxadiazon is an 
oxadiazole herbicide (Meister, 1981) . 
Water contaminate d with nitrate and/or herbicides  is of concern for human  health  if the 
water is consumed . One of the major health effects of drinking nitrate -contaminated water 
is methemoglobine mia or blue  baby syndrome which is the result of nitrate conversion to 
nitrite in the infants’ body . The nitrites combine with hemoglobin in the infant’s blood to 
form methemoglobin, which is incapable of transporting oxygen from the infant’s lungs to 
its body tissues – hence, “the blue baby syndrome.”  (Knobeloch, Salna, Hogan, Postle, & 
Anderson, 2000) . A study performed in 2009 on a group of pregnant women showe d that 
there is a correlation between high levels of atrazine in the drinking water and poor birth 
outcomes such as low body weight and incomplete bone formation (Ochoa -Acuña, 
Frankenberger, Hahn, & Carbajo, 2009) . There are also studies that show correlation 70 
 
` between e xposure to atrazine and Non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma, prostrate and ovarian cancer 
(Dorsey, 2003) . 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set the maximum contamina nt level (MCL) 
of 10 ppm for NO 3-N and 3 ppb for atrazine (EPA, 2018) .  The EPA has not established 
any MCL s for triallate and oxadiazon but they  are both classified as highly toxic to fish 
and aquatic organisms (Company, 1989) . The 96 -hr lethal dose (LD) -50 in rainbow trout 
and bluegill exposed to triallate ar e reported to be 1.2 and 1.3 mg/L, respectively 
(Company, 1989; Meister, 1981) . Moreover, an increase in tumors was seen in rats and 
mice fed oxadiazon in lo ng term. Based on these results, U.S. EPA classified oxadiazon as 
likely to be carcinogenic to humans (Richert, Price, Chesne, Maita, & Carmichael, 1996) . 
Groundwater contaminated with nitrat e and herbicides needs to be treated before being 
used as a source of drinking water. Pump -and-treat is a type  of ex-situ remediation 
technique, used for contaminated groundwater. In this method, the contaminated water is 
extracted from the subsurface and sent to a treatment operation. The treated water w ould 
then be discharged back into the aquifer (Brusseau, 2019) .  
Once extraction wells transfer the contaminated water to the surface, the treatment methods 
are selected, based on the contaminants and the capacity of the treatment facility (Eastern 
Research Group & Information, 1996) . 
Reverse osmosis (RO) and ion exchange are currently the two most used methods to 
remove nitrate from groundwater. However, they both have disadvantages such as high 
energy requirements, the generation of waste products that need careful disposal , and high 
operation and maintenance costs  (Bohdziewicz, Bodzek, & W a̧sik, 1999) . 71 
 
` Several methods have been tested to remove atrazine from water. Nanofiltration is one of 
the successful methods for atrazine removal. One study has reported the removals rate of 
66%- 98% for atrazine contaminated water at an initial concentration of 3 –5 µg /l 
(Organization, 2011a) . UV radiation is another effective method that has been tested in 
reducing atrazine concentrations. In lab studies, 5 -minutes irradiation time using 254 nm 
UV light removed 90% of atrazine. When tested at pilot plant scale, 70% of atrazine in a 
chalk borehole water was eliminated with UV dose of up to 700 W/m3 (Organization, 
2011b) . 
Biological treatment can be an economical  and sustainable option for groundwater 
remediation. Strains of bacteria have been previously st udied and applied for biological 
treatment of atrazine. In one study, a bacterial consortium consisted of Rhodococcus sp. 
FJ1117YT , Bradyrhizobium japonicam CSB1, Arthrobacter 7 sp. CD7w and β-
Proteobacteria CDB21  was found capable of degrading chloro -s-triazines (simazine and 
atrazine) and methylthio -s-triazines (simetryn and dimethametryn) over 4 and 9 -days 
cultivation period, respectively. The mineraliz ation occurred via the herbicide’s 2 -hydroxy 
13 analogues (Yamazaki et al., 2008) . 
Even  though strains of bacteria have shown promising results as bioremediation agents, 
they need high carbon and nutrient sources compared to algae (Subashchandrabose et al., 
2013) . Using  microalgae can be an interesting alternative technique  for biorem ediation of 
waterbodies. Utilization of nutrients and organic compounds by microalgae is an eco -
friendly treatment technique, as it produces valuable biomass that can be used for biofuel 
production (Ummalyma, Pandey, Sukumaran, & Sahoo, 2018) . 72 
 
` Studies on the interactions between pesticides and algae have shown that microalgae is 
capable of bioaccumulation, biosorp tion or biotransformation of some environmental 
pollutants (Rath, 2012) . Microalgal biomass has also shown to be effective in the removal 
of nitrate and heavy metals from aqueous solutions (Puranik & Paknikar, 1997; Volesky & 
Holan, 1995; B. Wang & Lan, 2011) . Immobilization of microalgae is an attractive 
technique to retain biomass in a natural or synthetic polymer for a range of biological 
operations. The main advantages of using microalgae in immobilized form are easy 
separation of biomass from water, protecting cells from the harsh environment such as 
toxicity, and relatively high cell density (Al-Rub et al., 2004) . These advantages make 
immobilized algal beads a great candidate for biological treatment of groundwater.  
If immobilized microalgae is used as the remediation technique in groundwater pump and 
treat, nitrate, metals, and h erbicides can also be removed simultaneously through 
assimilation, biosorption, bioaccumulation or biodegradation processes.  
In this study, the possibility of using immobilized scenedesmus sp.  for bioremediation of 
groundwater in contin uous flow reactor (CFR) is evaluated.  
 
4.3 Materials and Methods  
4.3.1 Cultivation of algae  
Scenedesmus . sp. was obtained from previous experiments at the C ivil and Environmental 
Engineering Department at the University of Nebraska -Lincoln and cultivated using Bold's 
Basal  Medium (BBM) at room temperature. The algae solution was illuminated using 
artificial plant light with the intensity of 600 -700 Lux. The solution was used to prepare 
algal beads about two weeks after cultivation.  73 
 
` 4.3.2 Preparation of algae - alginate beads  
Immobilized algae -alginate beads were prepared by entrapping Scenedesmus sp in an 
alginate matrix according to the following steps: algae solution was centrifuged and a 
mixture of concentrated algae and a 2% sodium alginate solution was dropped into a 2% 
calcium chloride solution using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, model 55 -3333). The 
drops of algae -alginate gelled into 2.3 ± 0.1 mm diameter beads upon contact with the 
calcium chloride solution. The formed beads were kept in calcium chloride solution 
overnight to harden. The beads preparation procedure was described in our previous work 
(Mollamohammada , Hassan, & Dahab, 2020) . 
4.3.3 Experimental conditions  
The experiments were performed using synthesized and actual groundwater. Synthesized 
groundwater was made by adding potassium nitrate (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) and an 
analytical standard of atrazine (99.9%,  Sigma Aldrich) to DI water at concentrations of 10 
mg/L NO 3-N and 0.1 mg/L atrazine, respectively. The effect of the temperature on nitrate 
and atrazine removal efficiency was evaluated as one of the critical factors here. The 
reactors were operated at tw o different temperatures to represent different seasons; 20 °C 
to represent the fall and the spring, and 35 °C to represent summer. A summary of the 
experimental conditions is shown on Table 4.1.  
The actual groundwater was collected from the C ity of Hastin gs Water Utilities, Hastings, 
NE. Upon collection, the water sample was stored in a refrigerator at 4°C. A complete 
analysis was done to quantify the concentration of nitrate, metal and non -metal ions and 
herbicides ( Table 4.2). Prior to being used in the experiments, the suspended solids were 74 
 
` removed by filtering water through a Whatman syringe filter membrane. All the 
experiments with actual groundwater were performed at 20 °𝐶.

The treatment process was performed in continuous flow reactor (CFR), using four 500 
mL flasks. A schematic of a CFR is shown on Figure 4.1.

The feed water was continuously pumped and accumulated in each reactor for the average 
of 7 days. Immobilized algal beads were added to the reactors at the beginning of the 
experiments. Light sources illuminated algae from above on an 18h: 6h light: dark cycle to 
simulate sunlight.  
To prevent contamination, the flasks used in the experiments were autoclaved for 20 min 
at 121  °𝐶. Each flask contained 400 mL of the aqueous solu tion and the ratio of the beads/ 
75 
 
` solution was 12.5% in all the reactors, based on the results from Chapter 3 . Experiments 
were performed under  heterotrophic conditions and glucose was used as an organic carbon 
source at a concentration of 1 25 mg/L.  
No add itional nutrients or glucose were provided in the beads or in the bulk solution of the 
reactors containing actual groundwater.  
All experiments were performed in triplicates and the results presented in this work is the 
mean of three replicated studies.

4.3.4 Analytical Measurements  
The concentration of NO 3-N in the reactors was measured using a UV -vis 
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Nano -Drop, model 2000). Vacuum -assisted sorbent 76 
 
` extraction (VASE) (Entech Instruments, Model 5800) was applied in combinati on with gas 
chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC -MS) (Agilent Technologies, Model 5977B) to 
measure the concentration of herbicides in the aqueous solutions. The concentration of 
dissolved oxygen (DO), Chemical Oxygen demand (COD) and pH were measured usin g a 
DO meter (YSI, model 5100), TNTplus vial tests (Hach, TNT820) and pH meter (Thermo 
Scientific, model Orion 3 -star). Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy dispersive X -
ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were performed using Nova Nano SEM (FEI, model 450)  
in order to examine the morphological structure and elemental analysis on the beads. The 
concentration s of metals and non -metal elements in the groundwater w ere quantified using 
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP -MS) (Agilent, 7500 CX).  
4.4 Results and Discussion  
4.4.1 Algae growth and Nitrogen Removal  
The density of the algal cells inside of the immobilized mat rix was measured using Dry 
Cell Weight ( DCW ). As it’s shown in Figure 4.2a, the highest biomass concentration was 
observed in the r eactor operating at 20 °C. Previous studies have also reported 20 -25 °C as 
the optimal temperature for algal biomass production (Delgadillo -Mirquez et al., 2016; 
Martınez, Sánchez, Jimenez, El Yousfi, & Munoz, 2000) . Rupture of algal cells occurred 
in the reactor operating at 35 °C toward the end of the treatment process. It could be 
contributed to the excessive temperature of the water which inhibited the growth of the 
cells (Martınez et al., 2000)  
 Exposure of algal cells to high temperature over a long period impacts structure and 
activity of the cell m embrane, which disturbs metabolic processes and result in the 
retardation of growth (Béchet, Laviale, Arsapin, Bo nnefond, & Bernard, 2017) . Low 77 
 
` concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) was also an indicator of retardation in growth of 
algal cells in temperature of 35 °C. When algal cells photosynthesize, they consume 
dissolved carbon dioxide and produce oxygen (Mollamohammada et al., 2020) . A drop in 
pH value toward the end of the treatment operations is another indicator that  photosynthetic 
is decreasing in algal cells . 
The conductivity of the water was also measured in different days of the treatment. As  
shown in Figure 4.2b, the reactor operating at 35 °C has higher conductivity compared to 
the one operating at room temperature. The conductivity increased over time in both 
reactors. As it was explained in materi als and methods, the immobilized beads were kept 
in calcium chloride solution to solidify. Increasing the conductivity over time is due to the 
presence of calcium and chloride ions in the bulk solution, which have partially diffused 
from the beads to the w ater.

` Figure 4.3 shows the average nitrate uptake in CFR during a period of 29 days as a function 
of time. As it is shown, the nitrate concentra tion in the bulk solution decrease d over time 
in the reactor oper ating at room temperature; and reache d steady state status at day 21. For 
the reactor operating at 35°𝐶, the nitrate concentration in the solution starts to rise after 16 
days.  
Nitrate uptake by algal beads requires energy and reducing power, which is pr ovided by 
glucose, carbon dioxide and the light. Physical, chemical and biological factors impact the 
rate of nitrate uptake by algal beads and temperature is considered as one of the most 
important physical factors.  (Pedersen, Kraemer, & Yarish, 2004) . Generally, the opt imum 
temperature for the algal growth is the same as the optimum temperature for the uptake  of 
the nutrients (Pedersen, Kraemer, & Yarish, 2004) . For Scenedesmus  sp., 20°𝐶 was 
reported as the optimum temperature to achieve the maximum specific growth  rate (Xin, 
Hong -Ying, & Yu -Ping, 2011) . 
A rapidly growing, healthy culture is needed to provide an efficient long -term nitrate 
uptake treatment system. Since the nitrate uptake rate is a function of algal growth, a high 
nitrate up take rate may not be achieved under too low or too high temperature. According 
to these results, two different trends are recognizable based on the temperature of the water. 
At 20°𝐶 (spring or fall), it is useful to keep the culture until the end of 30 days projected. 
In 35°𝐶 (summer), however, it is best to replace the algal beads after 10 days of the 
treatment to keep the nitrate uptake rate at the maximum range.

4.4.2 Atrazine removal  
The performance of the algal beads operating at 20° C and 35° C in removal of atrazine is 
summarized in Figure 4.4. A higher removal rate was observed in the reactor operating at 
35° C at the beginning of the experiments (day 5). By day 15, the performance of the reactor 
operating at room temperature surpa ssed the 35 °C one. The solution was tested for the 
concentrations of two atrazine metabolites; Deethyl -atrazine  (DEA), and Deisopropyl -
atrazine  (DIA) and none of them was detected in the solution. The algal beads were also 
tested for the presence of atraz ine and nothing was detectable in the beads. Since the 
removal occurred during the period of 29 days, the microalgae had enough time to 
bioaccumulate, metabolize or facilitated the degradation of atrazine.  Since the removal rate 012345678910

` by the control (alginate be ads) is about half of what observed in algal beads, it is still 
possible that the removal of atrazine by algal beads happened through combination of 
adsorption on the surface of the alginate, followed by bioaccumulation and biodegradation 
by microalgae. Ge nerally, sorption of organic compounds (e.g. atrazine) is a passive 
process that is performed by chemical partitioning into the hydrophobic biomass. The 
uptake of atrazine by the algal cells includes an initial sorption, which is due to the affinity 
of the  atrazine to the surface of the algae, followed by membrane transport of atrazine into 
the algal cells. The environmental conditions may not have an impact on the first phase; 
however, transport of atrazine through the cell membrane into algal cells may be impacted 
by several factors, such as composition of the cell membranes and specific binding to 
photosystem II components of the chloroplast (Tang, Hoagland, & Siegfried, 1998) . 
High density of microalgae in the beads accelerated the atrazine bioaccumulation rate at 
the start of the experiments in the reactor performing at 35°C. The continuous excessive 
temperature however, lowered the density of the algal cells in the beads and decreased the 
removal rate.

4.4.3 Remediation of the Actual Groundwater  
Table 4.3 shows the removal efficiency of nitrate and other ions from the actual 
groundwater after 29 days of operation in the CFR. Nutrient removal by algal beads 
includes the adsorption of nitrate on the surface of the bead, penetration into the alginate 
and then, sorption into the cells (MS Abdel Hameed, 2007) .  
The Nitrate removal rate depends on culture conditions such as the medium composition . 
In this case,  groundwater was rich in nutrients  and trace minerals  and provided a suitable 
environment for microalgae to grow and assimilate nitrate.  
Among the elements present in the water, the removal rate of Mg, P, and Zn was the hig hest 
(100%, 99.9% and 92%, respectively). SEM and EDS analyses were performed to study 
the surface morphologies of the beads after exposure to the groundwater ( Figure 4.5).

SEM provide s more insight into the mechanism of metal sorption by algal beads and help 
in the detection of active sorptive areas , and EDS analysis can confirm the identity of the 
elements on the surface of the beads (W. W. Mazna h, A. Al -Fawwaz, & M. Surif, 2012) . 
The SEM images of algal beads exposed to the groundwater show that the surfaces of these 
beads were rough, and ha d more fractures compared to what we s aw in the unexposed 
beads ( Figure 4.5b). These changes could  have happened due to the presence of the metal 
ions in the solution. Carboxyl, hydroxyl, sulphate, phosphate, amino, amido and phenolic 
groups are reported as functional groups on the surface of algal beads which can attract 
heavy metals (Petrovič & Simonič, 2016) . Therefore, one can assume that the metals in the 
solution were attached to the functional groups and made changes on the surface of the 
beads (WO Wan Maznah et al., 2012)  84 
 
`  
Figure 4.5 SEM and EDS analysis of immobilized S. Sp  beads exposed to a) groundwater and b) 
an unexposed bead . 
 
The EDS spectra of the immobilized  Scenedesmus  sp. beads confirmed the presence of 
some metal and non -metal elements on the surface of biosorbent. The sur face of the beads 
was covered with gold prior to SEM/ EDS analyses and that’s why we see the peak of gold 
within the EDS spectrum. The spectrum also showed peaks for C, O, and Ca, which could 
be explained by the composition of the algal beads. Alginate is one of the main components 
in algal beads which consists of  β -D-mannuronic acid  and α -L-guluronic acid  units; which 
are rich in C and O . CaCl 2 was used in preparation of algal beads as the hardening material 
85 
 
` and it explains the presence of Ca ions on the surface of the beads.. The other main elements 
on the surface of the beads exposed to the groundwater were K, P, S, Mg and Na, all of  
which existed in theses samples according to the ICP -MS analysis ( Table 4.2) and re moved 
by algal beads ( Table 4.3). Biosorption can be the main mechanism controlling metal 
uptake by algal beads. In biosorption process, metals ions transfer from the solution to the 
surface of the beads, which contain s active binding sites. The metal ions then diffuse into 
the pores of absorbent and finally on the internal surface of the beads (Petrovič & Simonič, 
2016) . 
The algal beads were also tested for their capability in removing herbicides. No residual 
herbicides were found in the solution at days 1 -10 of the operation. Therefore, 100% of 
oxadiazon and triallate were removed in the first 10 days of treatment in CFR.  Partial 
uptake of herbicides was observed in the control, which was , likely,  due to the adsorption 
on the surface of alginate. At days 1 and 10, the medium w ith algal beads contained less 
amounts of herbicides than the controls (w/o alga), indicating that  the herbicides were 
accumulated by the algae.  
The rate of biodegradation ⅆ𝐵
ⅆ𝑡(𝜇𝑔.𝑑−1)  was calculated using Equation 4.1:  
ⅆ𝐵
ⅆ𝑡=𝑚̇𝑖𝑛−𝑚̇𝑜𝑢𝑡−𝑚̇ⅆ−𝑚̇𝑐           Equation 4.1 
Where 𝑚̇𝑖𝑛 is the mass of the herbicide entering the reactor , 𝑚̇𝑜𝑢𝑡 is the mass of the 
herbicide in the effluent,  𝑚̇ⅆ is the mass of herbicide adsorbed by the alginate beads, 
and 𝑚̇𝑐 is the mass of the herbicide acc umulated in microalgae. All mass rates are 
measured in  𝜇𝑔.𝑑−1. 86 
 
` The accumulation rate of triallate reduced from day 1 to 10 and biodegradation rate started 
to increase. An unsteady accumulation rate by algal beads was an indicator of 
biodegradation occur ring in the cells. For oxadiazon, however, no accumulation was 
detected in the beads and the majority of uptake , likely  occurred through adsorption on the 
alginate beads ( Figure 4.6b).

According to the previous studies, accumulation of xenobiotics may result in stress in algae 
cells, caused by toxicity of the herbi cides. This stress can activate the defense mechanism 
of the cells and result in degradation of herbicides (Szewczyk, Kuśmierska, & Bernat, 
2018) . Therefore, although the herbicides may inhibit the growth of  Scenedesmus sp, they 
can promote the accumulation and simultaneous degradation,  and enhance the overall 
remediation rate.  
4.5 Conclusion s 
In this chapter, the experiments in CFR were performed to assess the capability of 
immobilized algal beads removing nitrate and herbicides in continuous flow mode. The 
following conclusions could be drawn from this study:

` 1.  The results show that the immobilized algal beads were  more effective in nitrate and 
atrazine removal in room temperature (20 °C) than the high temperature ( 35 °C). The 
results suggest that during spring or fall the culture can be kept until the end of 30 days 
projected. During summer, it is best to replace the algal beads after 10 days of the treatment 
operation.  
2. Immobilized Scenedesmus sp. beads were  capable of simultaneous removal of nitrate, 
metals and herbicides from actual groundwater in the CFR.  The removal of oxadiazon and 
triallate occur red through the combination of adsorption, bioaccumulation and 
biodegradation. Due to the possible toxicity o f the herbicides to the algae, the removal 
efficiency decreased as the treatment process progresse d.

FURTHER STUDIES ON THE USE OF ALGAE -BASED TREATMENT FOR 
NITRATE AND HERBICIDES REMOVAL FROM CONTAMINATED SURFACE 
WATERS  4 
 
5.1 Abstract  
The treatment effi ciency of Scenedesmus  species , immobilized in sodium alginate was 
evaluated for removing nitrate and herbicides from surface water. The experiments were 
performed in a continuous flow reactor and a hydraulic retention time  (HRT)  of 7 days was 
provided. The surface water was collected from two different locations: Rockford Lake, 
Beatrice, Nebraska with cyanotoxins, triall ate and cycloate contamination and Wahoo 
Creek, Ashland, NE  with ametryn, simetryn and alachlor. The average rem oval efficienc ies 
of nitrate from Rockford Lake and Wahoo Creek w ere 85% and 80%, respectively , during 
29 days of the operation. Nearly 100% of Mercury and Sulfur were eliminated at the end 
of the treatment process. The beads were able to remove 90 -100% of  ametryn, simetryn, 
alachlor, triallate and cycloate during  the first 10 days, but the herbicides started to diffuse 
back into the solution toward the end of the treatment process. These results suggest that 
immobilized algal beads can be used as a natural , low -cost alternative for bioremediation 
of the contaminated surface water.

` 5.2 Introduction  
The presence of excessive nutrient and xenobiotics residue in surface water is likely the 
result of excessive application of agrochemicals in the past decades (Szewczyk, 
Kuśmierska, & Bernat, 2018) . Transport of fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides from 
agricultural fields to the waterbodie s has decreased the water quality and caused 
environmental contamination (Gentry, David, Smith -Starks, & Kovacic, 2000) .  These 
contaminants have been previously observed in streams that receives large amount of 
agricultural runoff.  
Most fertilizers that are used in agriculture contain nitrogen and are known as the primary 
source of high nitrate levels in waterbodies (Majumdar & Gupta, 2000) . Among herbicides, 
triazines are the most heavily used in agricultural fields (Klementova & Keltnerova, 2015) . 
Triazines are characterized by a structure of nitrogen -containing  heterocycle (Szewczyk et 
al., 2018)  and known for inhibiting photosynthesis in broadleaf weeds (Brooks et al., 2005) . 
S-triazines or 1,3,5 -triazines with the formula of (HCN )3 are a group of herbicides that are 
highly soluble in water and have long half -life time (Navarro, Vela, Giménez, & Navarro, 
2004; Szewczyk et al., 2018) . S-Triazines can easily leach from the soil to the water bodies 
and are considered major risks to the environment (Prosen, 2012) .  
Ametryn [4 -N-ethyl -6-methylsulfanyl -2-N-propan -2-yl-1,3,5 -triazine -2,4-diamine], and 
simetryn [2 -N,4-N-diethyl -6-methylsulfanyl -1,3,5 -triazine-2,4-diamine] are two common 
types of S -triazine herbicide (Hayes et al., 2002) .  They bind to the quinone -binding protein 
in photosystem II, and inhibit the photosynthetic electron transport in w eeds (Bonora et al., 
2013; Yalkowsky, He, & Jain, 2016) . 94 
 
` Ametryn is classified as a class III herbicides; meaning that it has moderate toxic effects 
on fish, human s and large mammals , but it is considered highly toxic to crustaceans and 
molluscs   (Navaratna et al., 2012) . Simetryn is toxic to the aquatic system and the studies 
have proven that the exposure of tadpoles to simetryn in concentrations founds in water 
used for rice cultivation can be highly toxic (Saka, 2010) . 
Alachlor (2 -chloro -N-(2,6-diethylphenyl) -N-(methoxymethyl)acetamide), is another type 
of herbicide, which belong s to the  chloroacetamide  class (Dale, Renner, & Kravchenko, 
2006; Wilson, 1984) . Triallate [N,N -bis(propan -2-yl)[(2,3,3 -trichloroprop -2-en-1-yl) 
sulfanyl]formamide] and cycloate [N -cyclohexyl -N-ethyl(ethylsulfanyl)formamide] are 
two other types  of herbicides, that belong to thiocarbamate family. All three have the same 
application as S -triazine herbicides (Dale et al., 2006; Wilson, 1984) . 
The residues of alach lor in drinking water has been regulated under the Safe Drinking 
Water Act (SDWA). EPA has set the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 2 ppb for 
alachlor (EPA, 2018) .  Alachlor is known to increase the risk of developing cancer and 
other chronic diseases (W. J. Lee et al., 2004) . 
Triallate is considered highly toxic to aquatic organisms (Company, 1989) . Cycloate is 
classified as “Not Likely Carcinogenic to Humans”, however, a study performed on rats 
show ed that cycloate is a neurotoxicant and a large oral dose of this herbicide induce d a 
cell-specific and highly localized forebrain lesion (Simpson et al., 2005) .  
Microorganisms have been studied and applied to remove herbicides from water. 
Rhodococcus sp. strain FJ1117YT was found to be effective in degrading simetryn. 
Methylsulfinyl and methylsulfonyl analogues were identified as the metabolites (Fujii, 95 
 
` Takagi, Hiradate, Iwasaki, & Harada, 2007) . In another study, Paecilomyces marquandii , 
a microscopic fungus , was found capable of alachlor removal by N -acetyl oxidation 
(Szewczyk, Soboń, Słaba, & Długoński, 2015)  
Eventhough bacteria have shown promising results  in removing organic pollutants, they 
need high carbon and nutrient sources compared to algae (Subashchandr abose et al., 2013) . 
Algae can be a sustainable alternative for contaminted water bioremediation. Algae can 
take up nutrients and organic compounds and produce valuable biomass which can be used 
to produce biofuel (Ummalyma et al., 2018) . 
Microalgae are shown to be able to assimilate, accumulate, sorb or transforme  some 
environmental pollutants (Rath, 2012) . In one study, the bioremediation of a mixture of 
herbicides including Atrazine, Molinate, Simazine, Isoproturon, Propanil, Carbofuran, 
Dimethoate, Pendimethalin, Metoalcholar, Pyriproxin was evaluated using the microalgae 
Chlorella vulgaris . The microalgae w ere able to remove 87% to 96.5% of the herbicides 
(Hussein, Abdullah, Badr El -Din, & Mishaqa, 2017) . 
Immobilization of microalgae is an attractive technique to retain biomass in a natural or 
synthetic polymer for a range of biological operations. The main advantages of using 
microalgae in immobilized form are easy separation of biomass from water, protecting 
cells from the harsh environment such as toxicity , and the production of relatively high cell 
density (Al-Rub et al., 2004) . These advantages make immobilized algal beads a great 
candidate for biological treatment of waterbodi es. In this treatment process, herbicides, 
heavy metals and nutrients can also be removed simultaneously.  
 In this study, immobilized microalgae were  evaluated as a natural treatment system for the 
uptake of nitrate and herbicides from surface water. To assess the capability of the beads 96 
 
` in real working scenarios the experiments are performed during two stressed conditions: 
lake with algae bloom and cr eek at harvesting season with large concentration of 
herbicides.  
5.3 Materials and Methods  
5.3.1 Cultivation of algae  
The strain of Scenedesmus  sp. was cultivated in Bold's Basal  Medium  (BBM). A grow light 
was used to illuminate the microalgae solution at the intens ity of 600 -700 Lux. The solution 
was used to prepare the algal beads about two weeks after cultivation.  
5.3.2 Preparation of algae - alginate beads  
To prepare the immobilized algae - alginate beads, the algae solution was centrifuged at 
3500 rpm, and the concentra ted cells were mixed with a 2% sodium alginate solution. The 
mixture was then dropped into a 2% calcium chloride solution. Algal beads which are 2.3 
± 0.1 mm in diameter were formed upon contact with calcium chloride solution.  
5.3.3 Experimental conditions  
The e xperiments were performed using actual samples of surface water. The water samples 
were collected from two different locations : Rockford Lake, Beatrice, NE, and Wahoo 
Creek, Ashland, NE. Wahoo creek was chosen because it receives large amount of 
agricultur al runoff. The sampling was performed in June because of the expected high 
concentration of nitrate and herbicides in the creek resulting from agricultural activities.  
 Rockford Lake was selected based on the weekly results from the Nebraska Department 
of Environmental Quality  (now the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment) 97 
 
` reports . The weekly reports identified cyanotoxins in the lake around late July  of 201 9 and 
it was when the samples were collected.  
The samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C. A complete analysis was completed to 
quantify the concentration of nitrate, herbicides and other constituents  (Table 5.1). Before 
starting the experiments, the suspended solids in the water were removed through filtration. 
All the experiments were perf ormed at 20 °𝐶.  
The results from batch studies in Chapter 3 w ere used to select the operational parameters 
in continuous flow reactors (CFRs).  The nitrate and herbicide impaired water was passed 
through a CFR . Four 500 mL flasks were used to test this pr ocess. A schematic of the CFR  
used in these experiments  is shown on Figure 5.1. 
The feed water was continuously pumped and allowed to accumulate in each reactor. 
Accumulated water stayed at an average HRT of 7 days . Algae beads were added at the 
start of the experiments.  Light sources were introduced from above on an 18h: 6h light: 
dark cycle to simulate sunlight.  
All flasks were autoclaved for 20 mins at 121  °𝐶 prior to being used in the experiments. 
No additional nutrients or glucose was provided in the beads or in the  bulk solution during 
the experiments.  
The experiments were performed in triplicates and the results presented here is the mean 
of three replicated studies.

5.3.4 Analytical Measurements  
A UV -vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Nano -Drop, model 2000) was used to 
quantify the concentration of NO 3-N in the reactors. The concentration of herbicides was 
measured using Vacuum -assisted sorbent extraction (Entech Instruments, Model 5800) in 
combination with gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies, Model 
5977B). The  dry cell weight (DCW) was measured to determine the growth of algal cells 
inside of the beads. Energy dispersive X -ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron 
microscopy (W. J. Lee et al.)  analysis was performed using Nova Na no SEM (FEI, model 
450) for the elemental analysis and examination of the bead’s morphology. Inductively 
coupled plasm a-mass spectrometry  (Agilent, model 7500 CX) was used to measure the 
concentration of the heavy metals in the water.  
5.4 Results and Discussion  
100 
 
` 5.4.1 Algal growth  
Figure 5.2a shows the changes in DCW and dissolved oxygen (DO) for the two sets of 
CFRs. As shown, the algal cells had lower growth in the reactor containing water sample 
from Rockford Lake. In both reactors, DCW and DO concentration started to go down after 
10 days of  the operations and continued  toward the end of the treatment process.  
As shown in Table 5.1 , the sample from Wahoo Creek contain ed simetryn, ametryn and 
alachlor. Studies have shown that these herbicides are toxic to green microalgae, which 
could have been the main reason for retardation of algal growth toward the end of the 
treatment process. The herbicides can inhibit photosynthesi s by interfering in the Hill 
Reaction  which is an important step in photosynthesis and involves transfer of electrons 
from water molecules to  Hill reagents (non -physiological oxidants) as part 
of photosynthesis process.  (Gaggi et al., 1995) .  
As was indicated in Materials and Methods, sampling from Rockford Lake was performed 
in summer, when the algal bloom -forming cyanobacteria was present. The bloom -forming 
cyanobacteria are known for producing toxins such as hep atotoxic peptides, dermatotoxic 
phenolic compounds and neurotoxic alkaloids which can colonize the bead and compete 
with the algae and inhibit the growth (Sivonen et al., 1990) .  
Algal cells use carbon source and produce oxygen when photosynthesiz ing. Photosynthesis 
also increases the pH of bulk solution as it removes carbon dioxide  (Mollamohammada et 
al., 2020) . Therefore, the drop in concentration of DO and pH are indicators that 
photosynthet ic is decreasing in algal cells which occurred in both CFRs . 101 
 
` Conductivity of the waterbodies is affected by the discharges to the streams as well as 
bedrock they are flowing through. For example, streams that flow through granite bed rock 
have lower conductivity compared to the ones that flow through clay soil; beca use granite 
is made of materials that do  not ionize into the water. (Bhateria & Jain, 2016) . As shown 
in Figure 5.2b, Wahoo Creek ha d higher conductivity compared to Rockford Lake. In both 
samples, the conductivity increased over time. As was described in Materials and Methods  
section , the algal beads were kept in calcium chloride solution to solidify before being used 
in the experiments. It was possible that the increas e in conductivity over time was because 
of the presence of calcium and chloride ions which may have partially diffused from the 
beads to the  bulk solution.

5.4.2 Nitrate Removal  
Figure 5.3 shows the removal efficiency of nitrate from Wahoo Creek and Rockford Lake 
during a period of 29 days as a function of time.  As shown, the nitrate concentration 
decrease d in the reactor conta ining the Wahoo Creek sample during the first 10 days; and 
then concentration increase d after that. For the reactor containing sample from Rockford 
Lake, the lowest nitrate concentration was observed on day 8 and the reactor reached a 
steady state conditio n after 20 days.  
Nitrate uptake by algal beads start s with adsorption on the surface of the bead, continued 
with penetration into the alginate and then, sorption into the cells (MS Abdel Hamee d, 
2007) . Nitrate removal rate is very depend ent on culture conditions such as medium 
composition. The herbicides and toxins presented in water samples inhibited the algal 6.46.66.877.27.47.67.888.2

` growth and thus, lowered nitrate assimilation rate. Th is would explain the increase in 
concentration of nitrate in the bulk solution  toward the end of the treatment  period . 
Comparing the results with the control (alginate beads) shows that rather than assimilation 
by microalgae, nitrate removal may have taken place through adsorption on the surface of 
the alginate beads. As shown in  Figure 5.3, the removal rate by the control treatment in the 
CFRs containing Rockford Lake sample is higher than the one with Wahoo Creek.  It is 
concluded that cyanobac teria could also be partially responsible for the nitrate uptake.

` The removal efficienc ies of the metals and non -metal ions present in the water are shown 
in Table 5.2. Hg and S were the only elements that were removed completely in both 
reactors.  
EDS analysis coupled with SEM was performed to evaluate the morphological  changes on 
the surface of the beads after exposure to the water samples (Figure 5.4). SEM examines 
the mechanism of metal sorption by the beads and help s in detect ing active sorptive areas 
and EDS analysis examine s the distribution of elements on the surface of the beads (WO 
Wan Maznah et al., 2012; Michalak, Marycz, Basińsk a, & Chojnacka, 2014) .

Figure 5.4 SEM and EDS analysis of immobilized S. Sp  beads exposed to a) Rockford Lake and b) 
Wahoo Creek; and c) shows an SEM image of the unexposed bead . 
 
The SEM images revealed significant changes in the morpho logy of the beads exposed to 
the water samples from Wahoo Creek and Rockford Lake. Figure 5.4a and 5.4b show that 
the surfaces of the beads were heterogeneous, with more fractures after being exposed to 
the surface water samples compared to an unexposed bead (Figure 5.4c) 
It is possible t hat presence of the metal ions in the solution could have been the reason 
behind these changes on the surface of the beads.  
The main mechanism for metal sorption by  algal beads is the formation of the complexes 
between the ions and functional groups (carboxyl, carbonyl, amido, amino etc.) on the 
surface or inside the porous structure of the algae (Jin-Fen, Rong -Gen, & Li, 2000) . 
Therefore, the attraction of the metals in the solution to the functional groups could’ve 
caused the changes on the surface of the beads (WO Wan Maznah et al., 2012) . 
107 
 
` The EDS analyses of the immobilized Scenedesmus  sp. beads confi rmed that some ions 
were present on the surface of the algal beads. The beads were coated with gold before 
observation and that would explain the presence of the Au peak within the EDS spectrum.  
The EDS spectrum also showed peaks for C and O which are due  to the composition of 
organic matter and alginate in the beads. High intensity Ca peaks were observed on the 
surface of the beads exposed to the W ahoo Creek sample .  CaCl 2 was used in to form the 
algal beads and the presence of Ca is because of the crossl inks between Calcium ions and 
the carboxylic groups  present in the  alginate (Pasparakis & Bouropoulos, 2006) . No Ca 
was observed on the beads exposed to  the Rockford Lake water  which could be due to the 
possible diffusion of the Ca ions into the bulk solution during the treatment process.  
 Ag and Si were two dominant ions on the surface of t he beads exposed to  the Rockford 
Lake water . The presence of these two elements was possibly because of using a silver tape 
to attach the beads to the steel plate before performing EDS analysis. K, P, S, Mg and Na 
were the other five dominant ions on the surface of the beads exposed to the Wahoo Creek 
water  which were existed in the samples accord ing to the ICP -MS analysis ( Table 5.1) and 
removed by algal beads ( Table 5.2).  
 
5.4.3 Herbicides removal  
Herbicide uptake by algal beads may involve adsorp tion, bioaccumulation, biodegradation 
or the combination of all three (Hussein, Abdullah, Badr El -Din, & Mishaqa, 2017) . The 
total uptake of the herbicides by  Scenedesmus  sp. beads through  biodegradation, 
bioaccumulation and adsorption are shown in Figure 5.5. The rate of biodegradation

Where 𝑚̇𝑖𝑛 is the mass of the herbicide entering with the influent into reactor , 𝑚̇𝑜𝑢𝑡 is the 
mass of the herbicide in the effluent,  𝑚̇ⅆ is the mass of herbicide adsorbed by the control 
treatment (alginate beads), and  𝑚̇𝑐 is the mass of the herbicide accumulated in mic roalgae  
biomass . All mass flow rates are measured in  𝜇𝑔.𝑑−1. 
As shown on Figure 5.5a-c, all triallate was removed after one day of starting the effluent 
reactor (7 days after the start -up of the treatment process) and the uptake started to decrease 
afterwards. For cycloate , the uptake was almost steady throughout the treatment process. 
For alachlor , the maximum uptake occurred at days 1 and 10.  
For all three herbicides, partial removal was done in the control treatment and through 
adsorption on alginate.  
The bioaccumulation rate of triallate and cycloate was reduced from day 1 to 10 and 
biodegradation started to increase. The unsteady accumulation can be an indicator of 
biodegradation occurring by the algal cells.  
The highest uptake of ametryn and simetry n was observed at days 1 and it started to slowly 
decrease afterwards. As shown on Figure 5.5d to e, the accumulation rate was very low, 
and the majority of uptake was occurred  possibly largely through adsorption on the surface 
of alginate or biodegradation.  
Bioaccumulation is defined as transfer and storage of pollutants into the interior of living 
cells. In this process, nutrients such as nitrat e, phosphate, and organic or inorganic carbon 
can also be removed from treated effluents (Barron, 1995) . The toxicity of the herbicides 
accumulated in the cells may cause stress in the algal cells, resulting in activation of the 109 
 
` cell’s defense mechanism. The defense mechanism can cause the degradation of the 
herbicides. (Szewczyk, Kuśmierska, & Bernat, 2018) . Therefore, if given enough time, the 
accumulation of herbicides can result in degradation and increase the overall removal rate.  
Biodegradation of herbicides by algae is affected by two important factors: f irst, type of 
microalgae and the optimum conditions for its activity (such as optimum temperature, light 
intensity, etc.) and second, the composition of the herbicides. The molecular weight and 
functional groups of herbicides, their concentration, and toxi city to the algal cells can 
impact on the ability of algal beads to uptake herbicides (Rath, 2012) . Algae have shown 
to be more capable of metabolizing compounds with low molecular weight (Hussein et al., 
2017)  which can explain why the degradation rate is the highest for simetryn. Surface area 
to biovolume ratio of the algae is an important factor that determine s the algal capacity to 
uptake the herbicides. The higher the ratio, the greater potential for sorption of herbicides 
(Subashchandrabose et al., 2013) .

There are not many reported studies regarding the mechanisms and pathways of herbicide 
degradation by microalgae . Previous studies have shown that exposing microorganisms to 
xenobiotics will result in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species generation 
(Boyd, Jaynes, & Ross)  which may induce an oxidative stress conditions (Szewczyk et al., 051015202530

` 2018) . Microorganisms produce different types of oxid ative enzymes such as peroxidase, 
polyphenoloxidase, laccase, and tyrosinase that can affect  the transforming xenobiotics 
(Van Eerd, Hoagland, Zablotowicz, & Hall, 2003) .  It is reported that the biotransformation 
of herbicides by algae could be catalyzed by dealkylating enzymes such 
as cytochrome  P450 (Subashchandrabose et al., 2013) . In most cases, the polymerization 
products have less toxicity compared to the substrate which lowers the over  all 
environmental  contamination associated with them (Van Eerd et al., 2003) . 
5.5 Conclusion s 
In this chapter, the experiments in CFR were performed to assess the capability of 
immobilized algal beads removing nitrate and herbicides in stressed conditions and their 
effectiveness as an alternative treatment of surface water . 
 The following conclusions could be drawn from this study:  
1. The results showed that the nitrate uptake rate by immobilized algae is very dependent 
on the culture conditions. Even though the algal cells are used in immobilized form, the 
herbicides and tox ins present in the water can lower their growth and impair their capability 
in removing nitrate.  
2. Despite the toxicity effect of herbicides and toxins, algae  beads were still able to remove 
90-100% of herbicides, and 93% of nitrate in the first 10 days o f the operation.  
3. Adsorption, bioaccumulation and biodegradation were the main three processes involved 
in the removal of herbicides. Further research is required to identify the mechanisms and 
pathways of herbicides’ degradation by microalgae to assess  the environmental impacts 
associated with them.  113 
 
` 3. The immobilized algal based treatment is a natural alternative to treat the contaminated 
surface water . One of the important applications of this  process can be the treatment of 
surface water that is used  in groundwater recharge. Recharging groundwater with treated 
water can serve to dilute the concentration of nitrate and herbicides in the groundwater, 
resulting in lower potential health risks.   Additional in -aquifer ( in-situ) treatment can also 
be realized as a result of in -aquifer storage.

A HYBRID BIGOLOGICAL -ADSORPT ION APPROACH FOR THE 
TREATMENT OF CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER USING IMMOBLIZED 
NANOCLAY -ALGAE MIXTURES 5 
6.1 Abstract  
Scenedesmus  species  cells mixed with nanoclay and immobilized on alginate gel, were 
found effective in removing nitrate, atrazine and metals from aqueous solutions. Gel beads 
containing the hybrid mixture removed 100% of 10 mg/L N nitrate and 98% of 100 µg/L 
atrazine from sy nthetic groundwater in 3 days. The optimal amount of nanoclay was found 
to be 0.30 mg per bead. The experimental data fit well into Freundlich adsorption isotherm 
and followed pseudo first -order kinetics. When tested in actual groundwater, 91% of nitrate 
and 100% of Cr, Se and V were el iminated in 3 days without need for any nutrients or 
carbon source. Immobilized algal beads embedded with nanoclay are a natural low -cost 
alternative for groundwater treatment. The gel beads can be reused for at least two cyc les 
without a compromise in performance. They are water -insoluble, easy to harvest, and offer 
high removal efficiency.  
 
6.2 Introduction  
Groundwater in rural area s is suffering from the overuse of nitrogen -based fertilizers and 
herbicides. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for the plants and is used in various forms to 
enhance plants’ growth. However, e xcess nitrogen in soil infiltrates into the groundwater

agriculturally contaminated groundwater, Chemosphere - journal , (under review).

` commonly in the form of nitrate (Sebilo, Mayer, Nicolardot, Pinay, & Mariotti, 2013) . 
Herbicides and pesticides are synthetic organic compounds used to control weeds, insects, 
and a variety of other agricultural purposes. Many herbicides are water -soluble and may 
dissolve in groundwater. Atrazine is one of the most commo nly used triazine herbicide in 
the US which is utilized to control broadleaf weeds. It is a concern to the water supply 
because of its toxicity, relatively long half -life (60 to 100 days) and poor absorption by soil 
(Koc = ~100). In most cases, the source of atrazine in groundwater is caused by leaching 
near wellhead s due to loading  the sprayers with atrazine , cleanup activities or back 
siphoning accidents during spraying operations (Isensee et al., 1988) . 
The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has set a maximum contaminant level 
(MCL) of 10  mg/L  for NO 3-N and 3 ppb for atrazine (U. EPA, 2018) .  
High levels of atrazine were detected in public water systems serving  people in Texas, 
Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Ohio (Naidenko, 2017) . 
Exposure to drinking water with a nitrate level above the MCL is a potential health risk. 
Methemoglobinemia, which is the result of nitrate reduction to nitrite in infants’ digestive 
system is reported to be common in infants fed formula using well water w ith elevated 
nitrate contamination (Greer & Shannon, 2005) .  Additionally, strong evidence relating 
drinking nitrate - contaminated water and colorectal cancer, thyroid disease, and neural tube 
defects was documented (Ward et al., 2018) . Nitrosamine  is formed in water contaminated 
with nitrate and atrazine. Nitrosamines have been reported to inc rease the risk of 
developing Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma (Rhoades et al., 2013a) . 119 
 
` Microalgal -based water treatment system is a sustainable solution to remove nitrate s; 
however, these systems also have disadvantages, such as expensive biomass harvesting (E. 
Eroglu et al., 2012) . Immobilization of microalgae in polymeric matrices is an attractiv e 
alternative that facilitates the biomass harvesting and makes the operation more flexible 
(S. Fierro, M. del Pilar Sánchez -Saavedra, & C. Copalcua, 2008) . Algal immobilized gels 
can be manufactured using both synthetic (e.g. polyurethane, poly vinyl alcohol) and 
natural (alg inate, carrageenan, agar, chitosan) polymers. A proper carrier must be porous 
enough to allow the diffusion of the molecules from bulk solution to the cells. For the 
autotrophic living algal cells, the carrier must be transparent and allow light transmissi on 
(Moreno -Garrido, 2008b) . 
Several studies have been performed to evaluate the capability of immobilized algal beads 
in removing nutrients from aqueous solutions. Immobilized Chlorella 
vulgaris  and Scenedesmus rubescens  removed more than 90% of phosphate, nitrate and 
ammonium from s econdary, synthetic wastewater within 9 days (C. Garbisu, Gil, Bazin, 
Hall, & & Serra, 1991) . In Chapter 3 , the removal efficiency of nitrate was e valuated in 
groundwater using immobilized Scenedesmus sp (S. sp)  beads. The immobilized beads 
were able to remove 90% of nitrate from groundwater in 2 days.  
The mechanism of nitrate uptake by algal beads involves the adsorption of the nitrate onto 
the surf ace of the bead, penetration into the polymer and then, sorption into the cells (MS 
Abdel Hameed, 2007) . Hence, a faster adsorption process could lead to a faster nitrate 
assimilation by microa lgae which will increase the nitrate removal rate considerably.  
 Adding an adsorbent to the algal beads will accelerate this process especially if it is 
positively charged to attract the negatively charged nitrate ions. As an abundant low -cost 120 
 
` natural adso rbent, clay was used to aid microalgae in enhancing nitrate removal from 
groundwater. Clays have been successfully used in removing nitrate, heavy metals, and 
endocrine -disrupting chemicals from water (Rezvani & Taghizadeh, 2018; Srinivasan, 
2011) . Clays are primary made of particles with at least one dimension in the nanometer 
scale; therefore, they can be regarded a s nanoclay (Yuan & Wu, 2007) . The speciﬁc surface 
area of the nanoclay can reach to a few hundred m2/g, due to their small size. Their high 
surface area, combined with nano -size dimension and peculiar charge are three most 
important factors behind their large tendency for taking up ions and organic compounds 
from water (Srinivasan, 2011; Yuan & Wu, 2007) . Several studies explored the application 
of nanoclay as adsorbents for nitrate and atrazine removal. Clay mineral originated from a 
dam site in Morocco was optimized for the adsorption of nitrate.  Highest nitrate removal 
of 72% was achieved at the pH = 5.1, using 1 g/L of adsorbent (El Ouardi, Qourzal, 
Alahiane, Assabbane, & Douch, 2015) . Clay minerals modi fied by a cationic surfactant 
were used in batch mode for the adsorption of pesticides. The results showed an increase 
in the adsorption rate, compared to untreated clays, however, the adsorption coefficient of 
atrazine was found to be very low  (Sanchez -Martin, Rodriguez -Cruz, Andrades, & 
Sanchez -Camazano, 2006)  . In another study, high sorption values of atrazine (98% after 
18 h) on dye -clay complexes were achieved; however, the concentration of adsorbent used 
was very high (50 gL−1) (Srinivasan, 2011) . 
In this study, a mixture of algae ( S. sp)  and positively charged nanoclay particles, 
immobilized on alginate gel, (hybrid biological -adsorption system) are evaluated for the 
removal of nitrate and atrazine from synthetic and actual groundwaters. Because of its high 
surface area, nanoclay can accelerate the adsorption of nitrate and atrazine from the b ulk 121 
 
` solution and result in a faster removal rate. Batch and sequential batch growth studies are 
conducted to evaluate the treatment efficiency. The nitrate uptake capacity of the hybrid 
system is quantified based on different uptake mechanisms of adsorptio n, biological 
assimilation, and extracellular enzyme activity resulting from toxicity.  
6.3 Materials and Methods  
6.3.1 Cultivation of algae  
A sample of the microalgae strain S. sp.  were cultivated in a sterilized Bold’s Basal 
Medium (BBM) which contained nitrogen, phosphorus and the other macro and 
micronutrients; and kept at room temperature (20 °C). The light necessary for algal growth 
was provided by sunlight and artificial plant light. The intensity of light varied between 
600-700 Lux.  After about two weeks of c ultivation, the microalgae were used for bead 
preparation.  
6.3.2 Preparation of nanoclay embedded algal beads and experimental conditions  
To prepare nanoclay embedded alginate -algae beads, the cells of S. sp  were first harvested 
by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for  10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells 
were resuspended in DI water and mixed with a 2% sodium alginate solution and sufficient 
amount of nanoclay. The nanoclay  mineral used in the experiments was purchased form 
Sigma Aldrich ( St. Louis, MO ) and used as is after dissolution and sonication. The 
nanoparticles were  treated with 25 -30% w/w trimethyl stearyl ammonium (TMSA) - a 
cationic surfactant . All required growth medium  nutrients, except nitrate, were added to 
the suspension.  122 
 
` A syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, model 55 -3333) was used to drop the mixture of 
algae, alginate, and nanoclay into a 2% calcium chloride solution. The uniform beads 
(diameter: 2.35 mm) were forme d upon dropping the mixture into the calcium chloride 
solution and were left overnight to harden. As a control sample  and blank beads were 
prepared without adding any algal cells. The experiments were performed using synthetic 
and actual groundwater sample s. Synthetic groundwater was prepared using DI water 
mixed with target concentration of nitrate and/or atrazine. Potassium Nitrate (99.9%, 
Sigma Aldrich) and analytical standard atrazine (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) were used to 
achieve concentration of 10 mg/L NO 3-N and 0.1 ppm atrazine, respectively. The actual 
groundwater sample was collected from a pump station at the C ity of Hastings, NE , and 
stored at 4°C in a refrigerator. Before being used in the experiments, the suspended solids 
in groundwater were remov ed by filtering through a Whatman syringe filter membrane of 
0.45 mm pore size.  
All experiments were carried out in 500 mL flasks at 20 °𝐶. The flasks were autoclaved 
for 20 mins at 121  °𝐶 in order to prevent any contamination. Each flask contained 400 mL 
of the aqueous solution. The ratio of the beads/solution was 12.5% in all reactors. The 
experiments with the synthetic groundwater were performed under  heterotrophic 
conditions by adding g lucose (125 mg/L) to each reactor as an organic carbon source. The 
concentration of Chemical Oxygen demand (COD) was used as a surrogate for determining 
glucose availability. When actual groundwater was used, no additional nutrients or glucose 
were provide d in the beads or to the bulk solution. All experiments were performed in 
triplicates and each result presented here is the mean of three replicated studies  123 
 
` 6.3.3 Analytical Measurements  
UV-vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Nano -Drop, model 2000) was use d to 
measure the concentration of NO 3-N in all reactors. A new method based on vacuum -
assisted sorbent extraction (VASE) (EnTech Instruments, 5800) used with gas 
chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC -MS, Agilent Technologies, 5977B) to measure 
the concentra tion of atrazine in the solutions. A Dissolved Oxygen (DO) meter (YSI, 5100) 
was used to measure the concentration of DO in each reactor. pH and conductivity of the 
bulk solution were measured using a pH meter (Thermo Scientific, Orion 3 -star) and a 
conduc tivity meter (Hach, HQ14D). TNTplus vial tests (Hach, TNT820) were used to 
record the COD of the bulk solution. Zeta potential of the beads was determined using a 
Zeta Potential Analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments, ZetaPals).  
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM ) was used to examine the morphological structure of 
the beads. SEM images were taken using a Nova Nano SEM (FEI, 450), with the voltage 
ranging between 2 to 5 kV. The beads were air dried first and coated with a thin layer of 
gold before imaging. The anal ysis of metals in the groundwater was performed using 
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP -MS) (Agilent, 7500 CX).  
6.3.4 Viability and growth assessment  
The microscopic images of the algal colonies were taken using a Ti -S Inverted 
Fluorescence  micro scope (Nikon, Melville, NY). An assessment of the viability of the algal 
cells within the immobilization matrix was performed by isolating the live cells from the 
background using the color threshold function in ImageJ v 1.51 j8.  
6.4 Results and Discussion  124 
 
` 6.4.1 Adsorption capacity of nanoclay on algae -alginate matrixes  
To evaluate the impact of nanoclay on nitrate uptake rate by the algal beads, batch studies 
were performed using four different groups of alginate gel beads embedded with: nanoclay 
+ alg ae (Hybrid), nanoclay (Adsorption), algae (Biological) and none (Control).  
As shown on Table 6.1 , the hybrid beads produced the highest nitrate removal rate. They 
were able to remove 100% of nitrate in three days. The biological beads took  up 43% of 
nitrate in this time period. At day 3, the removal of NO 3-N in the adsorption and control 
groups were 20% and 10%, respectively. An increase in concentration of DO and pH, and 
reduction in COD were indicators of photosynthesis and glucose uptake by algal cells was 
highest in the biological beads. No photosynthesis was occurring in the adsorption and 
control beads because they did  not have any algal cells. This could explain why the 
concentration of DO and COD was almost stable in these two groups of the beads.  
It was evident that the nanoclay addition accelerated the nitrate uptake rate by the algal 
beads. The uptake occurred through the hybrid mechanism of consecutive nitrate 
adsorption on the nanoclay surface followed by assimilation by algal cells, as a 
physicochemical process. The availability of nitrate in a high density around algal cells 
increased assimilation rate and freed the surface for further adsorption. As described in 
Section 6.3.2, the nanoclay used in these experiments was treated with a cationic surfactant. 
The positively charged nanoclay enhances the adsorption properties of the beads and 
increases its tendency to adsorb the negatively charged entities which is nitrate in this case. 
Hence, making the dual mechanism of adsorption and assimilation of nitrate more efficient 
than each mechanism individuall y.  125 
 
` Two kinetics models, pseudo -first order and pseudo -second order were applied in order to 
understand the dynamics of nitrate adsorption on adsorption beads. The pseudo -first-order 
equation is shown as:  
ⅆ𝑞𝑡
ⅆ𝑡= 𝐾1(𝑞𝑒−𝑞𝑡)     Equation 6.1 
 
where 𝑞𝑒 and 𝑞𝑡 are nitrate adsorbed per unit mass of nanoclay (mg /g) at equilibrium and 
at time 𝑡 (day), respectively, and 𝐾1 (l/day) is the rate constant of first -order adsorption.  
 
The pseudo -second orde r process is:  
ⅆ𝑞𝑡
ⅆ𝑡= 𝐾2(𝑞𝑒−𝑞𝑡)2      Equation 6.2 
Where 𝑞𝑒 and 𝑞𝑡 are defined in the same way as in the first order reaction and 𝐾2 (𝑔.𝑚𝑔
𝑑) is 
the constant of the second -order adsorption . Graphically, these two models showed that the 
adsorption followed the pseudo -first order  model. The pseudo -first order model had a 
higher correlation coefficient (0.910) compared to the second order -model (0.770). Also, 
the calculated 𝑞𝑒,𝑐𝑎𝑙 from the first order model agreed with the experimental value ( Table 
6.2).

6.4.2 Impact of nanoclay dosage on nitrate uptake by the beads  
Varying amounts of nanoclay were used in order to determine the effect of the nanoclay  
mass  on the nitrate removal rate. The range changed from 0.0030 to 0.60 mg per bead and 
the removal effi ciency of nitrate increased from 9.2% to 98.6%. The beads containing 0.30 
and 0.60 mg  of nanoclay showed the highest  nitrate uptake (98.8% and 98.2%, 
respectively).  
The process of nitrate uptake in immobilized algal beads appears to start with adsorption 
of nitrate on the surface of the bead, followed by penetration into alginate and sorption into 
cells (M. A Hameed, 2007) . Therefore, adsorption on alginate gel and nanoclay, and nitrate 
assimilation by algae cells would be the three major processes invo lved in nitrate uptake . 
Figure 6.1 separates these three processes. The adsorption rate by alginate beads was 
calculated from the nitrate uptake by con trol beads. The adsorption rate by nanoclay and 
assimilation rate by microalgae are calculated using Equations 6.3:  
𝐴𝑠,𝑡= 𝐴ℎ,𝑡−𝐴𝑛,𝑡          Equation 6.3 
Where 𝐴𝑠,𝑡 is the amount of nitrate assimilated by microalgae and 𝐴ℎ,𝑡 and 𝐴𝑛,𝑡 are quantity 
of nitrate uptaken by hybrid and adsorption beads, respectively, after 𝑡 days of operation.  
Adsorption by nanoclay is calculated using Equation 6.4:  128 
 
` 𝐴ⅆ,𝑡= 𝐴𝑛,𝑡−𝐴𝑐,𝑡       Equation 6.4 
Where 𝐴ⅆ,𝑡 is the amount of nitrate adsorbed by nanoclay and 𝐴𝑐,𝑡 is quantity of nitrate 
uptaken by control beads after 𝑡 days of the operation.  
Since the quantity of algin ate is the same in all six groups of beads, the adsorption rate by 
alginate will be identical for all of them. According to Figure 6.1 the adsorption  capacity 
of the nanoclay and assimilation rate by microalgae increases by increasing the dose up to 
0.30 mg/bead and reaches an equilibrium at this point. There is no significant change in 
nitrate uptake rate at dosage higher than 0.30 mg/bead.  
To determi ne the changes in surface charge of the hybrid beads, the zeta potential was 
measured at different days of the operation. As  shown on Table 6.3, incre asing the 
nanoclay concentration increased the zeta potential of the beads at the beginning of the 
treatment process (day 0). The nanoclay used in these experiments was treated with TMSA 
which contains a positive charge. Adding more nanoclay to the beads p rovides more 
positive charge and increases the zeta potential. As the treatment process progresse s, the 
zeta potential becomes more negative which  would  confirm the presence of nitrate ions in 
the beads. The highest “negative” zeta potential and greatest n itrate uptake was observed 
in the beads with the concentration of 0.3 mg nanoclay/bead.  
Increasing the nanoclay dose will provide more surface area and active sites for the 
adsorption of nitrate. At amounts higher than 0.30 mg/bead . However, the adsorbent 
particles may aggregate which would result in blockage of the active sites and no further 
nitrate uptake . Therefore, the concentration of 0.30 mg/bead  was considered  as an optimum 
dose and was used in the remaining experiments .  
Accor ding to Figure 6.1, adding more nanoclay to the beads also increases the assimilation 
rate by microalgae. Because of that, we expected an increase in DO concentration  which  129 
 
` did not occur. Therefore, it  is possi ble that there was a fourth  mechanism influencing the 
treatmnet process in the hybrid beads  which could have  been caused by  the inherent 
toxicity of TMSA to the algal cells. Previous studies have shown that the toxicity of some 
metals (e.g. copper) to the algal cells can increase the activity of the nitrate reductant (NR) 
enzymes  and the photosynthetis rate  (Han, Kang, Park, Lee, & Brown, 2008) . In this case, 
no increase in the photosynthesi s rate  was observed . Therefore,  the toxicity may cause 
some algal cells to break down and secrete  some of the NR  enzymes to the outside of the 
cells. These NR enzymes function faster outside of the cells and help the nitrate uptake rate 
to be faster than t he assimilation process. The accuracy of this theory will be evaluated in 
section 6.4.3.

The equilibrium of the adsorption on the adsorption beads was evaluated using the 
Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The Langmuir isotherm is based on the 
assumptions that adsorption only occurs at specific homogeneous sites within the nanoclay -
algin ate matrix and the adsorbent is saturated after one layer of nitrate molecules forms on 
the surface of it. The Freundlich isotherm describes the adsorption of multilayer surfaces 
(Wu et al., 2012) . The linearized form of the Langmui r and Freundlich isotherms can be 
seen in Equations 6.5 and 6.6, respectively : 
 
𝐶𝑒
𝑞𝑒=1
𝑞0𝐾𝐿+𝐶𝑒
𝑞0                              Equation 6.5 
log 𝑞𝑒=𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝐾𝑓+1
𝑛𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝐶𝑒                 Equation 6.6 
Where 𝑞𝑒 is the amount of nitrate adsorbed per gram of nanoclay (mg/g), 𝐶𝑒 is the 
equilibrium solution concentration of nitrate (mg/L), 𝑞0 (mg/g) is the maximum capacity 
of nitrate required to form a complete monolayer on the surface, and 𝐾𝐿 represents the 
Langmuir constant.  131 
 
`  𝐾𝑓 is the Freundlich adsorption constant, relate d to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent 
and 𝑛 is the Freundlich factor , related to the surface heterogeneity. 𝑞𝑒 was calculated by 
Equation 6.7:  
𝑞𝑒=(𝐶0−𝐶𝑒)
𝑚∙𝑉      Equation 6.7 
Where: 𝐶0 and 𝐶𝑒 (mg/L) are the initial and equilibrium nitrate concentrations, 
respectively, V (L) is the volume of the solution and m (g) is the mass of the nanoclay.  
Nitrate adsorption data on nanoclay alginate matri x fitted well to the Freundlich  model and 
higher 𝑅2 was derived in Freundlich isotherm ( 𝑅2=0.998 ) as compared to Langmuir 
model ( 𝑅2=0.912). Using Freundlich model, n and 𝐾𝑓 were found to be 0.335 and 0.165, 
respectively.  
In the Freundlich isotherm, the 1/n term describes the linearity of the adsorption process , 
where  1/n=1 indicates that the reaction between solute and adsorbent is linear, while 1/n<1 
indicates that the adso rption is unfavorable at lower equilibrium concentration and the 
shape of the nonlinear adsorption isotherm is convex. The term 1/n>1 indicates that the 
concave shape of nonlinear adsorption isotherm and it means that the adsorption is more 
favorable at lo wer equilibrium concentrations (Mohsenipour, Shahid, & Ebrahimi, 2015) . 
The obtained value of  1/n was computed to be 3.0 suggesting that adsorption of nit rate on 
the nanoclay -alginate matrix was more favorable at lower concentrations of nitrate.  
6.4.3 The role of TMSA on nitrate removal  
TMSA is a widely used cationic surfactant. Due to its chemical stability and heat and 
pressure resistance, it is used as a raw material for producing hair conditioner, fabric 
softener, silicone oil and rubber (Henton & E., 1989; Murray, 2001) .  TMSA is reported to 
be toxic to the Chlorella cells. Once inside the cell, TMSA may affect thylakoid 132 
 
` organization and chlorophyll synthesis which will result in impairment of photosynthetic 
capacity and lower the number of live cells. Although the mechanisms of TMSA toxicity 
may vary in different algae species, it is generally accepted that such toxicity impacts the 
structure of algal lipid membranes, binding with or denaturing membrane proteins. This 
will cause in creased membrane permeability and leakage of compounds like ions and 
amino acids that are significant for cell viability (Qv & Jiang, 2013) .  
The toxicity of the TMSA to algal cells might be the main reason behind the enhanced 
nitrate removal rate observed in hybrid beads ( Section 6.4.2). This toxicity may break down 
the cells, releases the NR enzymes and make them more readily available for nitrate uptake. 
To check the accuracy of this theory, the algal cells were mixed with different quantity of 
TMSA and immobilized in alginat e and tested for nitrate uptake. The nanoclay that was 
used in this study contained ~30% (by  wt.) TMSA. This mean t that the hybrid beads with 
the concentration of 0.06, 0.15 and 0.30 mg nanoclay/bead contained 0.02, 0.04 and 0.09 
mg TMSA, respectively. The se ratios were used to make TMSA - embedded algal beads.  
Live cell assessment was  then performed to check the toxicity of TMSA to the algal cells. 
Figure 6.2 compares the number of live cells in algal beads, embedded with 0.02, 0.04 and 
0.09 mg TMSA over time. As it’s shown, at day 0, the number of live cells is slightly higher 
in the cells embedded with lower mass of TMSA. In all three groups, the number of l ive 
cells decreases over time.  133 
 
`   
Figure 6.2 Change in the number of live cells in algal beads with 0.02 g, 0.04 and 0.09 mg TMSA 
per bead over time . 
 
The amount of nitrate uptake by TMSA embedded beads was  measured one day after the 
start of the experiments. As it’s shown on Figure 6.3a, the beads containing 0.02, 0.04 and 
0.09 mg TMSA, removed 0.78±0.44, 0.69±0.31, and 0.65±0.24 mg of nitrate respectively. 
This is about twice higher than the removal observed by the hybrid b eads, embedded with 
nanoclay , and containing the respective mass of TMSA. After 3 days of the experiments, 
the removal rate reached its maximum which was 3.27±0.05 mg nitrate. ( Figure 6.3b). 
In the TMSA embedded beads, there was a direct contact between the algal cells and 
TMSA.  Due to the apparent inherent toxicity of TMSA to the algal cells, the main 
mechanism controlling the treatments here can be the death of the cells and the subsequent 
134 
 
` releas e of the NR enzymes to the bulk solution which accelerates the nitrate removal rate. 
It is possible that the extracellular enzymes  activity is the fourth  mechanism controlling the 
treatment in hybrid beads ; and t he main reason behind the high nitrate uptake observed in 
Section 6.4.2 , above .

` 6.4.4 Evaluation of the performance of nitrate removal under sequential batch 
conditions  
While  nitrate was successfully removed in batch reactors, the durab ility of the treatment 
system was tested in sequential batch mode. The experiments were conducted in triplicate 
reactors for three consecutive treatment periods. At the end of each period, the treated water 
in each reactor was discarded and the reactors we re filled back with synthetic groundwater 
and glucose. In addition to the nutrients embedded within the beads during manufacturing, 
no additional nutrients were provided. As shown in Figure 6.4 the nitrate removal rate 
decreased from 96.2% to 47.5% over periods 1 to 3. Over time, the turbidity of the solution 
increased from 1.2 NTU (day 1) to 10.6 NTU (day 25) which could be a sign o f nanoclay 
leaching out of the beads and entering the groundwater matrix. In sequential batch mode, 
nutrients and calcium may get washed out from the reactors by the discarding of the treated 
water at the end of each period. Calcium is an essential ion for  the stability of the beads. 
When the beads form, calcium ions bind to the blocks of alginate chains and the strength 
of the alginate gel is largely dependent on the number of cross -links forms (Li, Fang, 
Vreeker, Appelqvist, & Mendes, 2007) . Since they were never replaced, the alga l cells may 
have faced calcium and nutrient deficiency, which lead to the loss of beads strength, lower 
nitrate assimilation and reduced performance . The beads may have longer lifetime when 
they are used with actual groundwater that is rich in nutrient and calcium. However,  it is 
also possible that the fragile beads ultimately break up due to repeated physical handling  
and possibly, shear forces within the reactor contents.  136

6.4.5 Examination of the efficiency of the beads on the removal rate of atrazine  
Figure 6.5  provides a graphical representation of the capability of the beads in removing 
atrazine from groundwater. Atrazine was reduced during first 24 h ours of treatment by 86% 
when using the hybrid beads. The removal by adsorption beads is estimated at 64%. 
There fore, the net percentage of atrazine removal by immobilized algal cells would be 
22%. On day 3, the removal efficiency reached the maximum of 98% for the hybrid beads 
and 96% for the adsorption beads. The removal rate for the adsorption beads stayed 
consta nt until day 5, but it decreased to 85% for the hybrid beads which was a sign of

` atrazine migration from the beads back to groundwater. When tested with biological beads, 
50% of atrazine was removed after 2 days of operation. The removal rate decreased to 40% 
at day 5.  
According to (Boyd et al., 1989) , clays modified using cations with large alkyl groups, 
(e.g., TMSA) contain paraffin -like layer of organic phase in the interlayer of the clay 
lattice.  This layer acts as the parti tion medium for the sorption of the organic compounds. 
Sorption of atrazine on TMSA modified nanoclay was a function of the organic phase in 
the interlayer of nanoclay, following the adsorption of cationic surfactants (TMSA) in the 
lattice (Dutta & Singh, 2015) . The mechanism of atrazine removal  by algae was not 
previously reported, and it may involve biosorption, bioaccumulation, or biodegradation , 
or a combination of these mechanisms . Atrazine is considered toxic to many strains of 
green algae. However, the toxicity of the atrazine depends on t he strain of algae and the 
exposure time. For Scenedesmus , the EC 50 ranges between 21 -49 ppb (Larsen, Stay, 
Shiroyama, & DeNoyelles Jr, 1986) . The initial concentration of atrazine used in these 
experiments was 100 ppb, which is higher than the reported inherent toxicity of atrazine to 
the algal cells. Therefore, it is postulated that, after 3 days of exposure, the atrazine 
molecules slowly sta rted to leave the cells and transfer to the bulk solution which caused 
11% reduction in uptake rate for hybrid and biological beads.  138

The solid/water distribution coefficient 𝐾ⅆ was calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of 
the adsorption on alginate beads in uptaking nitrate and atrazine. 𝐾ⅆ was calculated using 
the following equation:  
                                                  𝐾ⅆ= =𝐶𝑖−𝐶𝑒

Where,  𝐶𝑖 and 𝐶𝑒 are the initial and final (equilibrium) concentrations of the contaminant 
in solution (mg/L),  V is the volume of the solution (L), and  m is the mass of the adsorbent 
(g) (Hamoudi &  Belkacemi, 2013) . The distribution coefficients are shown in Table 6.4.

The higher 𝐾ⅆ values represent more effectiveness of the adsorbent material in removing 
target contaminants from the aqueous solution. As  shown in Table 6.4, adding nanocl ay 
to the alginate beads increase d the distribution coefficient from 0.231 to 3.85 L/g and 
improves the adsorption of atrazine significantly. There is also a slight increase in nitrate 
removal when alginate beads are mixed with nanoclay. However, the great est performance 
in nitrate uptake occurred  when nanoclay was added to the mixture of algae and alginate 
and the uptake occurs through the hybrid mechanisms of adsorption, biological 
assimilation, and extracellular enzyme activity ; as discussed in Section 6 .4.2, above . 
6.4.6 Application of actual groundwater  
The capability of the hybrid beads was tested in removing nitrate and metals from actual 
groundwater. The same procedure that was outlined in the Materials and Methods section 
was used to test the raw groundwater for the concentration of nitrate and metals prior to 
the start of the experiments.  
In these experiments. The h ybrid and biological beads removed 91% and 93% of nitrate 
from groundwater within 3 days without requiring any external organic c arbon source. The 
removal rate remained constant for biological beads and it reached 99% after 6 days  in 
hybrid beads . The uptake of nitrate by adsorption and the control beads during this period 
was 35% and 12%, respectively ( Table 6.5). 140

Some of the metals and none -metal ions that were present in the groundwater were fully or 
partially removed by hybrid beads ( Table 6.6).  
SEM analysis was performed to study the surface morphologies of the hybrid beads before 
and after exposure to the groundwater. SEM images show that the fresh beads had porous, 
heterogeneous surface. The pores and cavities on the beads facilitate the  sorption of nitrate 
and metals ( Figure 6.6a). After exposure to the groundwater the size of the pores decreased, 
and beads became smoother and compact ( Figure 6.6b).  141 
 
` The main process involved in the removal of metals by immobilized beads is thought to be 
biosorption, which is described as foll ows: the metal ions are first transferred from the 
solution to the biosorbent surface, which contain ed different functional groups that act as 
active binding sites (Petrovič & Simonič, 2016) .

` The metal ions then diffuse into the pores of adsorbent and eventually on the surface of the 
material (W. W. Maznah, A. T. Al -Fawwaz, & M. Surif, 2012) . In the hybrid beads, the 
surface properties of clay and the abundant functional groups of the gel provided adequate 
adsorption for the uptake of metals and facilitate the treatment process.  
6.5 Conclusion s 
Base d on the studies reported in this chapter, the following conclusions could be made:  
1. This study investigated the capability of nanoclay embedded Scenedesmus . sp. beads to 
remove nitrate, atrazine along with some metal  constituents  from aqueous solutions. The 
experimental data show that embedding the algal beads with nanoclay accelerates the 
nitrate removal rate.  
2. From the studies reported here, it was established that pseudo -first-order kinetic model 
described the kinetic rate, and the equilibrium data fitted well the Freundlich adsorption 
isotherm.  
3. The initial concentration of atrazine used in these experiments was 100 ppb, which is 
higher than the inherent toxicity of atrazine to the algal cells. Therefore, after 3 days of 
exposure, the atrazine molecules slowly started to leave the cells and transfer to the bulk 
solution . 
4. Nanoclay embedded beads can be a potential technique for remediation of water 
contaminated with nitrate or atrazine owing to its ability to improve the uptake capacity as 
well as apparent high selectivity for nitrate and herbicides.

CHAPTER 7   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  
7.1 Research Motivation and Summary of Conclusions  
The presence of nitrate and herbicide s in surface and groundwater impairs their  quality as 
a drinking water source s, and causes several health effects, such as methemoglobinemia 
and Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma. The contamination issue is exacerbated when considering 
that available water treatment methods such as r everse osmosis  are typically very 
expensive and energy extensive and require  special expertise which might be problematic 
in rural areas.  
The main goal of this study was to determine the capability of the immobilized algal -based 
biological system, as a natural alternative technique to remove nitrate and herbicides from 
waterbodies. This process can lower the health risks  associated with high concentration s 
of nitrate and herbicides and produces biomass which can be used as a source of green 
energy. The development of such a system started from using the ideal conditions in the 
lab, followed by test ing using actual contaminated water samples.  
The main objectives of this study were to optimize an immobilized algal -based system to 
remove nitrate from groundwater ; evaluate the capability of the designed system in real 
working  scenarios by using actual water samples , and finally, exploring a combined 
physical - biological approach for maximizing the uptake of nitrate from contaminated 
groundwater.  
The two microalgae species ( Chlorella vulgaris  and Scenedesmus species ) used in this 
work were acquired from Biochemistry Department at University of Nebraska -Lincoln. 146 
 
` Sodium alginate w as used an immobilizing agent in all of the experiments. To prepare the 
immobilized algal  beads, algae solution was centrifuged, supernatant was discarded, and 
the algal cells were  resuspended in DI water to obtain a concentrated solution. Next, the 
concentrated algae solution was mixed with sodium alginate solution. The mixture was 
dropped into a calcium chloride solution using a syringe pump and left overnight to form 
algal beads.  
The immobilized algal -based system  was first tested  in batch  mode, using synthetic 
groundwater . The optimum  operational parameters  that maximized the uptake rate of 
nitrate  in batch mode were then used to design the  sequencing batch and continuous flow 
reactors. The capability of the system in real working scenarios was evaluated later, using 
actual groundwater and surface water samples , contaminated with nitrate, herbicides and 
cyanotoxins.  
Finally, to improve the capability of the algal beads in removing nitrate and herbicides, a 
combined physical -biological system was designed by embedding the alga e cells with 
nanoclay , a natural material  with high absorbance capacity . The capability of nanoclay - 
embedded algal beads was tested in batch reactor , using synthetic and actual groundwater.  
The following are the principal conclusions drawn from this study, as related to the research 
objectives:  
Objective 1: Optimizing an immobilized algae -based  biological system for nitrate 
removal  
1. Immobilized Scenedesmus sp. beads were more effective in nitrate uptake from synthetic 
groundwater than the suspended cell system . 147 
 
` 2. Among different cultivation methods, the heterotrophic cultivation of immobilize d 
Scenedesmus . sp. was more effective in nitrate removal.  
3. The Initial algae concentration in the beads is an important factor in nitrate uptake rate, 
and the highest nitrate uptake rate was achieved in the beads made with the equal 
volumetric ratio of algae: alginate.  
4. Higher algal density in the beads caus ed more nutrients and glucose assimilation. 
However, the self -shading effect may have reduced photosynthetic activity of the cells 
toward the end of the treatment.  Therefore, it is suggested that the algal beads should be  
replaced before the self -shading e ffect occurs.  
5. Actual contaminated groundwater was found to be more suitable for nitrate removal than 
synthetic groundwater as it  may have contained more nutrients  and trace minerals  and 
facilitated algae growth inside of the immobilization matrix.  
Objectives 2 : Evaluating different reactors configuration  
1. Immobilized algal beads kept functioning for up to 100 days in sequencing batch mode.  
2. The immobilized algal beads were mor e effective in nitrate and atrazine removal at room 
temperature (20 °C) than at the high temperature of 35 °C in a continuous flow reactor.  
3. According to these results, the culture can be kept until the end of 30 days projected 
during spring or fall.  However, d uring summer, it may be necessary  to replace the algal 
beads  more frequently ( after 10 days of the treatment operation ). 
Objectives 3: Evaluating the performance of the algal - based biological system in real 
working scenarios  148 
 
` 1. The results using actual contaminated water samples showed that the immobilized 
Scenedesmus . Sp. beads were  capable of simultaneous removal of nitrate, metals , and 
herbicides in continuous flow mode .  
2. Even though the alga e cells used in this study were in an immobilized form, herbicides 
present in the water tended to degrade their growth rate and impair their capability in 
removing nitrate and herbicides.  It was observed that t he removal of herbicides was the 
highest during  the first 10 days of the treatment operation and it slightly went down 
afterwards.  
3. Adsorption, bioaccumulation and biodegradation were probably the main three 
processes involved in the removal of herbicides.  
4. The algal based system can be a great op tion to treat the surface water for reuse purposes 
including artificial recharge  of groundwater  aquifers . Recharging the aquifers with the 
treated water serves to  dilute the concentration of nitrate and herbicides in the groundwater , 
thus lower ing the potential health risks.  
 
Objective 4: Utilization of nanoclay -embedded algal beads as a combined physical - 
biological approach .  
1.The experimental data showed that embedding the algal beads with in nanoclay 
accelerates the nitrate removal . The removal  rate in this case appeared to follow a pseudo -
first-order kinetic model . The performance rate and equilibrium data appeared to best fit 
the Freundlich adsorption isotherm.  149 
 
` 2. The initial concentration of atrazine used in these experiments was higher than the 
inherent toxicity limit of atrazine to the algal cells. Therefore, after 3 days of exposure, the 
atrazine molecules slowly left the cells and transferred  back in to the bulk  solution.  
3. Nanoclay embedded beads can be a potential technique for treatment of water 
contaminated with nitrate or atrazine because of their exceptional uptake capacity as well 
as high selectivity for this anionic contaminant and herbicides.  
 
7.2 Recommend ations  for Further Study  
Further studies will be needed to help improv e the stability and the sorption properties of 
the immobilized algae. This can be done by evaluating and comparing the effect of other 
immobilization matrices on performance of microalgae. This work can lead to more 
effective use of immobilized algae, and as a result, accelerate the development of more 
effective biosorbents.  
To gain a better understanding of herbicide removal by algae, the pathway of herbicide 
degradation and their metabolites as well as the enzymes participating  would need to  be 
studied.  
 Economic studies are needed in order to compare the feasibility of immobil ized algal 
system in comparison with other techniques, such as ion exchange  and reverse osmosis . . 
The bioremediation system can also be tested in full scale in the aquifers with nitrate 
concentrations higher than the  regulatory level .
