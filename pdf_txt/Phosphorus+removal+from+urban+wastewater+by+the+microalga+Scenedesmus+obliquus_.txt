Abstract: In Europe, 2.52 kg nitr ogen and 0.51 kg phosphorous / inhabitant / year are discharged in wastewater. Conventional 
biological and chemical methods for wastewater treatment are costly and not fully efficient in removing nutrients, and the 
discharge of effluents in rivers and lake s enhances the eutrophication. The use of microalgae species to remove nutrients available 
in wastewater, as a sustainable and low- cost treatment option, and also the use of different systems for algal cultivation in 
wastewater, aiming to obtain biomass an d bio -products, is a growing field of research. Green microalgae, especially Chlorella 
species, play an important role in wastewater treatment while producing algal biomass, with numerous studies proving the high  
potential of Chlorella to consume nutrients  from different categories of wastewater: municipal wastewater, wastewater from 
agriculture, wastewater from zootechnics, industrial wastewater. Cultivated in autotrophic, heterotrophic or mixotrophic 
conditions, in open or closed systems, microalgae have an important role in reducing greenhouse gases, consuming 1.83 kg CO 2 / 
kg dry algal biomass. Algal biomass can be capitalized to obtain many value- added products, including biofuels. The aim of this 
study is to review the advances in the utilization of mi croalgae Chlorella vulgaris in the treatment of municipal and zootechnical 
wastewater, emphasizing the removal of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).  
Keywords: wastewater, nutrients, biomass, microalgae, Chlorella  
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Depending on their origin, municipal, agricultural, and 
industrial wastewaters contain variable amounts of organic 
matter, nutrients, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and other 
emerging contaminants, detergents, greases, oils, 
microplastics, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, sulfates, 
phosphates, fluorides, chlorides and a variety of pathogens.  
Nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus  and other minerals) are the 
main elements for eutrophication of natural water bodies 
(lakes), which manifests by oxygen depletion, h armful 
microalgal blooms and disturbances in the balance of the 
ecosystem. Nutrients discharged from wastewater are 
getting increased attention and have been strictly regulated 
worldwide. Even if it has low concentrations, the ammonia 
in wastewater effluen ts can be toxic to aquatic organisms 
and fish. Furthermore, the phosphate and ammonia may 
cause serious health issues in humans, such as methaemoglobinaemia in new- borns (Yamashita et al., 
2014).  
The nitrogen in wastewater is primarily due to the metabolic interconversions of extra derived compounds, and over 50 % 
of phosphorus comes from synthetic detergents (Abdel -
Raouf et al., 2012) used in households and different 
industrial activities. Nutrient concentrations and 
availability vary across the wide type s of wastewater. For 
example, total nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations 
can reach values of 10 –100 mg/L in municipal wastewater, 
more than 1000 mg/L in agricultural wastewater and 500 –
600 mg/L in zootechnical wastewater (Cheunbarn and Peerapornpisal, 2 010). In Europe, on average, 2.52 kg 
nitrogen and 0.51 kg phosphorous / inhabitant / year are discharged in wastewater (EU -EEA, 2015). The European Directive 6498/15/EC establishes a limit of 10 mg/L for total nitrogen and 1 mg/L total phosphorous containe d in effluents 
before discharge in natural waters. However, the effluents from wastewater treatment plants have much higher values: 
20–70 mg/L nitrogen and 4 –12 mg/L phosphorous (Rinna et 
al., 2017). Hence, wastewater should not be discharged 
unless proper  treatment. If not recycled, the nitrogen in 
wastewater is lost as N
2 or as important greenhouse gases 
such as N 2O, which can contribute up to 78 % of the carbon 
footprint of a conventional wastewater treatment plant (Vasilaki et al., 2018).  
The main forms in which they occur in wastewater are 
+
4NH
(ammonia), −
2NH (nitrite), −
3NO (nitrate) and −3
4PO
(orthophosphate). In the secondary effluent, the 
concentration of ammonia is between 40 -48 mg +
4NH − N/L, 
and the concentration of phosphorous is 9 –12 mg −
4PO − P/L 
(Martinez et al., 2000).  
Nitrogen is conventionally remo ved through biological 
nitrification and denitrification using aerobic and anoxic 
reactors, or by the application of dual sludge treatment, 
while phosphorus is removed by coupling anaerobic and 
aerobic reactors. The disadvantages of biological methods 
are the need of aeration, high energy demand and carbon 
footprint. Chemical methods like chemical precipitation, ion 
exchange and adsorbtion, or electrochemical methods like electrooxidation, are also used in wastewater treatment 
plants to remove the nutrients , but these methods have the 
disadvantage of generating high amounts of sludge from 
chemical reactions and precipitates. Conventional treatment 
of municipal wastewater (primary settling and biological ACTA TECHNICA CORVINIENSIS – Bulletin of Engineering  
Tome XI V [2021]  |  Fascicule 2 [April  – June ] 
66 | Fascicule 2 treatment) could remove 40 % of total nitrogen and 12% of 
total phosphorus (Rinna et al., 2017). Overall, regardless 
their category, the conventional methods for nutrients 
removal include many steps, with complicated operation for 
which are required skilled personnel, are energy intensive, 
produce large quantities of sludge and have high costs.  
With the new construction and upgrade of wastewater 
treatment plants and stricter disposal policies, alternative 
and sustainable approaches are needed for treating the ever 
increasing volumes of wastewater.  
MATERIALS AN D METHODS  
Bio-treatment, bioremediation or phycoremediation of 
domestic, agricultural and industrial wastewater involves the use of microalgae and has attracted increasing attention in recent years.  
Microalgae have the ability to adjust in adverse conditions; 
they grow naturally in many types of wastewater thriving on 
nutrients and forming an abundant resource of biomass. Microalgae have a rapid growth -rate (12 days), their 
doubling time during exponential growth are only 3.5 hours 
(Ungureanu et al. , 2020) and can double their biomass 
within 24 hours. During their growth, algal cells might accumulate high amount of lipids and carbohydrates, which 
makes them an important feedstock for biofuel production.  
Because of their photosynthetic capabilities, they convert 
the solar energy into abundant useful biomass.  Microalgae 
also play an important role in CO
2 sequestration, because the 
CO 2 needed for their photosynthetic metabolism can be 
provided from industrial flue gases. When CO 2 from flue 
gases is consu med during microalgae growth, this leads to a 
decrease of greenhouse gas emission to the atmosphere 
simultaneously with carbon fixation. It was estimated that 1 
kg of dry algal biomass consumes about 1.83 kg of CO 2 
(Rosenberg et al., 2011). Microalgae  have  carbon fixation 
rates much higher than those of land -based plants by one 
order of magnitude (Kumar et al., 2011).  
In addition to CO 2 mitigation, microalgae produce oxygen as 
a byproduct of photosynthesis, which can be used by aerobic bacteria to decompos e biologically the organic matter in the 
wastewater. Thus, microalgae can help to reduce the need for 
mechanical aeration during wastewater treatment (Otondo 
et al., 2018).  
Microalgae cultivation can take place in photoautotrophic, 
mixotrophic, or heterotr ophic conditions (Figure 1). As an 
emerging wastewater treatment method, microalgae treatment provides an alternative and sustainable pathway for the removal (uptake) of the inorganic nitrogen and 
phosphorous from wastewater. Sunlight or UV light, pH, 
temp erature, conductivity and water salinity are parameters 
for controlling and adjusting the process of microalgae cultivation (Nedelcu et al., 2019). Many other factors 
including nutrients, the concentration of organics and metal ions, or trace elements such  as Mn, Fe, Zn and Cu, can 
influence the microalgal growth in wastewater.  
Microalgae either grow naturally or are cultivated in open systems like wastewater lagoons, shallow algal ponds, high rate algal ponds, raceway ponds, constructed wetlands, and 
these  require large areas with considerable light exposition. About 90 % of the global algae production is conducted in 
the open systems (Placzek et al., 2017).  
 
Figure 1 –  Microalgae cultivation methods for wastewater 
treatment (Sundar Rajan et al., 2019)  
In recent years, a large variety of closed systems 
(photobioreactors) were developed. This equipment must be supplied with CO
2 and light and represent a possible 
economically viable alternative to conventional aerobic biological methods for wastewater treatment due to their potential of resource recovery and recycling (Christenson 
and Sims, 2011). The cultivation costs in closed s ystems are 
high and this limits their commercial applications to high -
valued compounds, but the costs can be reduced by efficient design of photobioreactors, which are able to achieve high 
areal biomass productivities (Placzek et al., 2017).  
To some extent , in addition to the uptake by microalgae, 
some of the nutrient removal might be due to physical and chemical processes like volatilization, precipitation or adsorption (AlMomania and Örmeci, 2016). Algae uptakes the phosphorus as inorganic orthophosphate,  preferably as 
−
4 2POH , −
4PO or −2
4 HPO  (AlMomania and Örmeci, 2016).  
Besided wastewater, there are other possible culture 
medium for microalgae growth. Centrate is a stream 
generated from dewatering of sludg e from primary and 
secondary settling, and mainly contains phosphorus, ammonia, and nitrogen. According to Wang et al. (2010), centrate is the best among all municipal wastewater streams 
for algal cultivation with high biomass accumulation and 
high efficie ncy wastewater nutrient removal.  In addition to 
different types of wastewater, activated sludge contains 90 –
95 % organic matter and nutrients and there are some 
studies that have shown that activated sludge  might be an 
alternative medium that could provide  the necessary 
nutrients for microalgae cultivation. Digestate from 
anaerobic digesters can also be used as suitable medium for 
microalgae cultivation, preferably after dilution with 
synthetic culture medium, secondary/tertiary wastewater or 
seawater (Dick inson et al., 2015).  
ACTA TECHNICA CORVINIENSIS – Bulletin of Engineering  
Tome XI V [2021]  |  Fascicule 2 [April  – June ] 
67 | Fascicule 2 Microalgae can improve the quality of the final effluent 
through natural disinfection because they reduce the 
pathogenic organisms, viruses, protozoa and coliform 
bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella found in municipal and 
livestock w astewater (Ungureanu et al., 2020).  
Wastewater treatment by microalgae can be achieved in the form of suspended free -cells culture and immobilized cells.  
The suspended free -cells culture is the condition of 
microalgae living cells to move independently within the flasks containing a medium under the condition to ensure uniform cells distribution (Katarzyna et al., 2015). The use of suspended free -microalgae cells culture involves the removal 
of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater whilst simultaneously providing oxygen (O
2) for aerobic bacteria 
coexisting in the culture. The immobilized cells culture is the condition of microalgae living cells to be prevented from 
flow freely from their original location to all parts of the 
medium (Emparan  et al., 2019). Several residual polymeric 
materials like alginate and chitosan are currently used for microalgae immobilization. Biofilms also provide a medium for immobilization of microalgae, because they are slimy, 
green layers consisting of large numb ers of microalgae 
entrapped in a gel -like matrix (Ungureanu et al., 2019).  
Research on algae -based wastewater treatment has focused 
mostly on the conventional microalgae and cyanobacteria, 
including Arthrospira sp., Botryococcus sp., Chlorella sp., 
Chlamydomonas sp., Haematococcus sp., Nannochloropsis  
sp., Scenedesmus sp. and Spirulina sp. 
Unicellular green microalgae Chlorella sp.  is spherical 
shaped, flagellate organism with a diameter of about 2 -10 µm 
(Figure 2). Chlorella sp. is mostly used in the tertiary 
treatment of wastewater, but it has high removal efficiency (> 80%) of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in primary and second treatment effluents.  
  
Figure 2 – Microalgae Chlorella vulgaris ( Brzychczyk et al., 2016)  
Under certain conditions, Chlorella sp. can completely remove ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorous, hence it has wide application in the treatment 
of agricultural and fecal wastewater (Wang et al., 2010). Its 
photoautotrophic growth is usually limited by lack of 
nutrients (particularly nitrogen), weak light, carbon 
limitation, changes in wastewater pH, and accumulation of 
photosynthetic oxygen (Yuvraj and Singh, 2016). Chlorella 
vulgaris produces more oxygen than all other plants in the 
world (Malothu R., 2020).  
In the context of a circular and bio -based economy and the 
development of biorefinery concepts, after wastewater 
treatment, the harvested microalgal biomass can be processed to obtain high -value products, including: 
cosmetics, pha rmaceutical products (with antiviral, 
antibacterial, anticancer, antihistamine role), steroids, algal 
toxins, pigments, organic fertilizers rich in N, P and K 
minerals, protein sources, animal feed, food products (juices, sauce, cheese, noodles, beverages) , preservatives in food 
industry, bioplastics, biosorbents (ion exchangers that can 
bind toxic heavy metals), bioenergy (biofuels including 
biogas, biodiesel, bioethanol, biobutanol, biohydrogen, 
biochar etc), and digester residues (compost and vermicompos t).  
RESULTS  
 Microalgae Chlorella in the treatment of municipal 
wastewater  
As reported by Wang et al. (2010), Chlorella sp. cultivated in 
wastewater from a local municipal wastewater treatment 
plant achieved removal rates of NH
4-N, phosphorus and 
COD of 74 .7%, 90.6% respectively 56.5%, before the primary 
settling stage. It was also reported a high removal efficiency 
of NH 4-N and phosphorus from secondary wastewater.  
Feng et al. (2010) cultivated Chlorella vulgaris in synthetic 
wastewater containing 78 mg/L  N-+
4NH and 400 mg/L COD 
was provided by glucose. Cultivation was done at 30oC, 
under 3000 lx light emission and 0.5 vvm  of air bubbling. The 
microalgae grew for 7 days, and the removal efficiency of 
nitrogen, phosphate and COD were 96%, 97% and 85%, 
respectively. In another study, Chlorella sp. grown in a 
highly concentrated municipal wastewater (centrate) 
achieved approximately 90 % of total nitrogen removal (Li et al., 2011).  
Choi and Lee (2012) investigated the effect of optimal 
concentration of Chlorella vulgaris (FC -16) with cell 
diameter between 3 –8 µm, for the removal of nutrients in real 
wastewater obtained from preliminary sedimentation of a 
wastewater treatment plant, using batch reactor operation. 
They observed that increasing the concentration of Chlorella 
vulgaris  from 1 to 10 g/L produced an increase of removal 
rates thus: total nitrogen from 81.04% to 84.81%;  total 
phosphorous from 32.26% to 36.12%; NH
3-N from 96.90% to 
97.26%, PO 4-P from 44.76% to 48.71%, COD from 78.33% to 
82.30%, respectively BOD from 80.41% to 82.92%.  
In a study conducted by Ebrahimian et al. (2014), Chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in b atch system and mixotrophic 
conditions supplied with CO
2 using a mixture of primary 
and secondary wastewater with 25, 50 and 75 volume percent of the primary wastewater. As presented in Figure 3, the removal rates using 25% of the primary wastewater were 100% for ammonium, 82% for nitrate and 100% for organic 
matter (COD).  
AlMomania and Örmeci (2016) tested the efficiency of Chlorella vulgaris, Neochloris oleoabundans and mixed indigenous microalgae collected from a wastewater 
treatment plant, for the remov al of nitrogen, phosphorus and 
organic carbon from primary effluent, secondary effluent, 
and centrate. The indigenous microalgae culture has proven 
to be more effective than Chlorella vulgaris and Neochloris 
oleoabundans in removing inorganic nitrogen (63. 2–80.8%),

68 | Fascicule 2 phosphorus (30.8– 70%) and chemical oxygen demand 
(64.9 –70.4%). Zhou et al. (2014) obtained removals of 76.7 –
92.3% of total nitrogen and 67.5– 82.2% of total phosphorus 
by Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Sce nedesmus obliquus, 
during wastewater treatment.  
 
Figure 3 - Removal of nitrate in a mixture of primary and 
secondary wastewater ( Ebrahimian et al., 2014)  
Caporgno et al. (2015) tested freshwater microalgae species Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella kessleri and the marine 
microalgae species Nannochloropsis oculata cultivated in 
urban wastewater, in batch mode using a flat -panel airlift 
photobioreactor. Both freshwater microalgae species 
achieved reductions of nitrogen concentration around 96% 
and 95% , and of phosphorous concentration around 99% 
and 98%. Nannochloropsis oculata was able to uptake 
nutrients from wastewater to grow but with less efficiency, 
indicating the need of microalgae acclimation or process optimization to achieve high nutrient rem oval.  
Bacteria are inevitably present in the wastewater and they 
interact with the microalgae, on the one hand potentially 
restricting their growth and on the other hand potentially enhancing the efficiency of wastewater treatment due to stimulation of mic roalgae growth. Some bacteria could kill 
the algae by releasing enzymes to break down the microalgae 
cell wall, and extracellular substances produced by bacteria 
could cause algae lysis (Ma et al., 2014).  
In this regard, He et al. (2013) studied the effec t of Chlorella 
vulgaris with or without co -existing bacteria on the removal 
of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter from 
wastewater. In the algae –bacteria system Chlorella vulgaris 
had a dominant role in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus, while bac teria removed most of the organic 
matter from the wastewater. Using the algae –bacteria 
consortium resulted in the removal of 97% ammonium, 98% phosphorus and 26% dissolved organic carbon at a total nitrogen level of 29 –174 mg/L. A study conducted by de -
Bashan et al. (2002) proved that the co -immobilization of 
microalgae Chlorella vulgaris in alginate beads with  bacteria 
Azospirillum brasilense was superior to a stand- alone 
microalgae system, obtaining removal rates of up to 100% ammonium, 15% nitrate and 36 % phosphorus.  
Kube et al. (2019) also proved that algae immobilization in 
alginate was more efficient and stable for synthetically- made 
municipal wastewater treatment, achieving a maximum 
nitrogen removal efficiency of 95% after 84 h of treatment.  Ma et a l. (2016) cultivated Chlorella vulgaris in wastewater 
with waste glycerol generated from biodiesel production, to 
improve nutrients removal and enhance lipid production.  
The tested concentrations of glycerol were 0, 1, 5 and 10 g/L. 
The optimal concentrati on of the pretreated glycerol for 
Chlorella vulgaris was 10 g/L with biomass concentration of 2.92 g/L, lipid productivity of 163 mg/L·day. Under these 
conditions, it was obtained the removal of 100% ammonia 
and 95% of total nitrogen (Figure 4).  
The highe st COD removal efficiency of the culture with the 
pretreated glycerol was 98%, possibly because some organic 
compounds in the crude glycerol, which were not removed 
by pretreatment, were not fully absorbed by Chlorella 
vulgaris.  
 
 
Figure 4 - Effect of concentration of pretreated glycerol on 
nutrients removal by C. vulgaris  (Ma et al., 2016)  
In a recent study, iron- magnetic nanocomposite particles 
(Fe 3O4@EPS) synthesized by co -precipitation of iron (III) 
chloride and iron (II) sulfate (Fe 3O4 nanoparticles) with 
exopolysaccharides (EPS) derived from the microalga 
Chlorella vulgaris were tested for the removal of nutrients 
from wastewater. Under optimum conditions (3.5 g/L of 
Fe3O4@EPS, pH 7.0 and 13 hours of incubation) 91 %  PO43− 
and 85 % of NH4+ were effectively eliminated, showing the 
potential of Fe 3O4@EPS application in removing nutrients in 
wastewater treatment plants (Govarthanan et al., 2020).  
 Microalgae Chlorella in the treatment of zootechnical 
wastewater  
Piggery wastewa ter contains high concentration of  
suspended solids and nutrients, small amounts of heavy 
metals and organic matter, antibiotics and hormones, so its 
insufficient treatment can cause serious environmental 
pollution and risks to human health. The typical 
composition of piggery wastewater exhibits the following 
ACTA TECHNICA CORVINIENSIS – Bulletin of Engineering  
Tome XI V [2021]  |  Fascicule 2 [April  – June ] 
69 | Fascicule 2 concentrations: nitrogen 800 –2300 mg/L, phosphorous 50 –
230 mg/L, biochemical oxygen demand 2000 –30000 mg/L, 
and N/P ratio is about 12 –17 (Chen et al., 2020).  
A common feature of piggery wastewater is the high-
strength ammonium, which is toxic for microalgae and 
therefore it should be mitigated during piggery wastewater 
treatment by microalgae,  by the addition of glucose to adjust 
C/N ratio of the wastewater (Lu et al., 2018). Recognizing 
the potential benefits of microalgae cultivation incorporated 
into the piggery sewage systems, studies into the use of 
microalgae as a treatment for piggery wastewater have been ongoing for the last decades.  
Lv et al. (2018) used Chlorella vulgaris selected from five freshwater microalgal strains of Chlorophyta for nutrients 
removal from undiluted cattle farm wastewater by two -
stage processes of microalgae -based wastewater treatment. 
By the end of treatment, 62.30%, 81.16% and 85.29% of chemical oxygen demand, ammonium and total phosphorus 
were removed.  
The two two- stage processes included a setup of double 
biological treatment by Chlorella vulgaris, respectively a 
setup of biological treatment by Chlorella vulgaris followed 
by activated carbon adsorption. After 3 –5 days  of 
wastewater treatment by the two processes, the nutrients removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand, ammonium 
and total phosphorus ranged between 91.24 –92.17%, 83.16–
94.27% and 90.98 –94.41%.  
 
 
Figure 5 – Removal efficiency of NH 3-N and COD at different 
nutrient concentration by Chlorella vulgaris JSC-6 grown 
mixotrophically (a), respectively heterotrophically (b) in piggery 
wastewater ( Whang et al., 2015)  
Whang et al. (2015) tested an isolated carbohydrate -rich 
microalga Chlorella vulgaris JSC -6 to treat piggery 
wastewater. They obtained between 70 –77% COD removal and 40 –90% NH 3-N removal in mixotrophic and 
heterotrophic conditions, depending on wastewater dilution ratio, with the highest removal percentage obtained 
for 20 -fold dil uted wastewater (Figure 5).  
Chlorella vulgaris can grow well in pretreated fresh pig urine 
(at 8 -fold dilution, pH=6, MgSO
4·7H 2O dosage of 0.1 mg/L). 
About 1.72 g/m2·day of microalgal biomass could be 
produced, and 98.20% of +
4NH -N and 68.48% of total 
phosphopous could be removed in the batch mode at cultivation in light- receiving -plate enhanced raceway pond. 
A hydraulic retention time of 7 -9 days is optimal for the 
efficient removal of nutrients and microalgae biomass 
production in continuous regime (Zou et al., 2020).

Zhou et al., (2018) cultivated Chlorella zofingiensis  in 
municipal wastewater and also in municipal wastewater mixed with 8 % pig biogas slurry. The latter contains abundant mineral nutrients after anaerobic treatment; hence 
it had a significant effect on microalgal growth (2.5 g/L 
biomass).  
Figure 7 illust rates that in municipal wastewater (MW), 
nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations decreased continuously in the first 24 hours, and then remained stable, 
with Chlorella zofingiensis showing a good removal 
efficiency of nutrients. Nitrogen decreased continuo usly 
within the first 60 hours then remained stable, whereas 
phosphorus concentrations decreased rapidly in the first 36 
hours.  
Overall, the removal rates for nitrogen and phosphorus in 
MW were 21 mg/L·day, respectively 4.6 mg/L·day, achieving

Zhu et al., (2013) treated piggery wastewater by the 
freshwater microalgae Chlorella zofingiensis, a protein -rich 
algae, and obtained removal rates of 68 –81 % for nitrogen, 
90–100 % for phosphorous, respectively 65 –76 % for COD.  
CONCLUSIONS Conventional me thods are widely employed for the 
treatment of municipal and zootechnical wastewater, which 
is based on biological and chemical systems and is costly. 
Hence, the use of microalgae for wastewater treatment got increased attention in recent years. In the pas t few decades, 
tremendous advances have been made in the field of algal 
technologies for combating numerous disadvantages of 
techno- economic order and improving biomass production, 
and the research is ongoing worldwide.  
Chlorella vulgaris is widely cultivated in different types of 
wastewater and it proved its efficiency in the removal of 
nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) that would otherwise 
cause eutrophication, and in the removal of chemical oxygen 
demand, biochemical oxygen demand, heavy metals, and 
even pathogens.  
Besides their important role in the sustainable treatment of 
wastewater and in the reduction of greenhouse gases, 
microalgae represent an abundant biomass with potential to be capitalized in obtaining biofuels of real interest in the 
current  climatic conditions.
