Abstract An up-flow fixed bed reactor (UFBR) was es-
tablished to investigate the biodegradation of fluoroben-zene (FB) under a number of operating conditions, whichincluded variation in the concentration of FB in the feedstream (up to 180 mg l
−1) and temporary suspension of
feeding. Degradation of FB was followed for a period of8 months under a continuous flow regime. During the op-eration of the UFBR, FB was never detected in the reactoreffluent, being biodegraded by the microbial biofilm oradsorbed to the granular activated carbon (GAC). Biodeg-radation of FB was observed from the beginning of thereactor operation, and overall, it accounted for 50% of thetotal amount fed to the bioreactor. High organic loads of FB(210 –260 mg d
−1dm−3) were found to affect the biological
removal efficiency, possibly due to an inhibitory effectcaused by the higher FB concentrations fed to the bioreactor(149 –179 mg l
−1). When FB feeding was suspended for
1 month, biodegradation continued, indicating that theadsorbed FB became bioavailable. Biofilm bacterial dy-namics were followed throughout the UFBR operation bydenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and plate-countingtechniques, showing that a quite stable community wasfound in the bioreactor, and this was mainly attributed to thehigh selective pressure exerted by the presence of FB.Introduction
Haloaromatic compounds constitute an important group ofpollutants that have been widely released into the en-vironment as a result of their common use in industriesand agriculture. Due to their useful properties and to theneed of finding acceptable alternatives for many chloro-aromatic pollutants, the use of fluoroaromatic compoundsbecame more frequent in the last decades. The physico-chemical characteristics of these compounds often makethem highly recalcitrant pollutants, with low susceptibilityto microbial degradation (Key et al. 1997 ). Nevertheless,
the biodegradation of fluoroaromatics has been reported byseveral authors (Wunderwald et al. 1998 ; Song et al. 2000 ;
Vargas et al. 2000 ). Very few studies are available on the
degradation of fluorobenzene (FB), a recalcitrant fluoroar-omatic compound. The potential sources of environmentalrelease of this compound are related to its main use as asolvent in the pharmaceutical industry, as an insecticide, asa reagent for plastic and resin polymers production, and asa starting material for the industrial production of manyfungicides and drugs (Banks et al. 1994 ; Freitas dos Santos
et al. 1999 ). Our previous research on microbial degrada-
tion of FB resulted in the isolation of a bacterial consor-tium and, later, of a pure bacterial culture (designated asstrain F11) capable of FB degradation when this was pres-ent as a single carbon and energy source (Carvalho et al.2002 ; Carvalho et al. 2005 ).
Biofilm reactors are extensively used in environmental
biotechnology and are generally considered as an effectiveprocess for the biological treatment of waters contaminatedwith organic pollutants (Armenante 1998 ; DeFilippi and
Lupton 1998 ). Such reactor systems allow for the ac-
cumulation of high concentrations of active biomass, andwhen packed with a suitable matrix, organic matter may beremoved through a combination of physical adsorption andbiological transformation, constituting a good solution forthe treatment of large effluent volumes containing lowconcentrations of pollutants and slowly biodegradable com-pounds. The removal of organic pollutants by immobi-lized microorganisms has been reported by several authors

bacteria (Heipieper et al. 1991 ; Lee et al. 1994 ; Shi et al.
1995 ; Abu-Salah et al. 1996 ). Due to its rough surface and
highly porous structure, gra nular activated carbon (GAC)
is a good attachment surface for biofilm development aswell as an effective adsorption matrix for different com-pounds, also serving as a buffer against shock loads of toxiccompounds (Abu-Salah et al. 1996 ; Khodadoust et al. 1997 ;
Carvalho et al. 2001 ; Moteleb et al. 2002 ). Immobilized
bacterial GAC reactors have been efficiently used for thetreatment of several aromatic compounds (Feakin et al.1995 ; Shi et al. 1995 ; Klecka et al. 1996 ).
In spite of biofilms constituting a fundamental com-
ponent of immobilized bioreactors, little is known aboutthe relationship between bi ofilm microbial dynamics and
bioreactor operation. Cultivation-independent techniqueshave been revealed to be very useful for the analysis ofmicrobial diversity, as they are more reproducible and arefree of the common biases derived from the traditionalcultivation-based methods. In the recent years, the de-naturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniquehas been successfully applied to explore the diversity ofmicrobial communities and changes in microbial popula-tions when exposed to fluctuations of environmental con-ditions (El Frantoussi et al. 1999 ; Luxmy et al. 2000 ).
In this study, the biological treatment of a synthetic
aqueous stream containing FB was investigated in an up-flow fixed bed reactor (UFBR) using GAC as the growthsupport matrix, when exposed to variable operating con-ditions, namely, transient concentrations of the pollutantand temporary suspension of substrate feeding. Given theuncommon capacity of strain F11 to completely degradeFB, the UFBR was inoculated with a pure culture of thisstrain in order to evaluate its biodegradation performanceand its stability in such bioreactor system. The dynamicsof the bacterial community developed along the UFBRoperation was also a target of this investigation. To ourknowledge, this is the first study reporting the biologicaltreatment of FB in a GAC bioreactor inoculated with amicroorganism capable of growing on this compound as asole carbon and energy source.
Materials and methods
Bacterial inoculum A single bacterial strain capable of
growing on FB as a sole carbon and energy source was usedto set up the bioreactor. Strain F11 was isolated from aconsortium previously enriched from a chemically con-taminated site in northern Portugal (Carvalho et al. 2005 ).
Pure cultures of F11 were grown in sealed flasks containinga minimal salts liquid medium (MM) (Caldeira et al. 1999 )
supplied with 100 mg l
−1of FB. The flasks were closed with
gas-tight rubber stoppers coated with a Teflon layer. Cul-tures were started in 100-ml flasks, filled to one-fifth oftheir volume, and progressively increased by sequentiallytransferring the cultures to 500-ml and 1,000-ml flasksfilled to one-third of their volumes. The flasks were in-cubated on a rotatory shaker at 150 rpm and 25°C. Growthwas monitored at 600 nm, and FB biodegradation was fol-
lowed through the measurement of fluoride ion liberation.
Reactor design and operation A continuous UFBR was
operated for treating an FB-containing aqueous stream.The reactor consisted of a cylindrical stainless steel col-umn (33 cm height and 3 cm internal diameter) providedwith sampling ports at its entrance, exit, and middle points(Fig. 1). The column was packed with 45 g of dry weight
GAC (0.85 –2.4 mm particle size), with an empty bed vol-
ume of 184 cm
3(80% of reactor volume). Prior to use,
GAC was washed several times with deionized water toremove carbon fines, dried in an oven at 105°C, and ster-ilized by autoclaving.
A silicon membrane, permeable to oxygen and pressur-
ized with filtered air, was introduced inside the reactor toprovide additional oxygen for FB degradation, whilst pre-venting evaporative losses of the compound. The mem-brane was folded in a helicoidal form around an inert metalsupport and placed in the center of the reactor. The totalmembrane area available for oxygen diffusion was 180 cm
2.
GAC was packed inside the reactor such that the membranesupport was completely covered by this matrix. The GACcolumn was inoculated with 200 ml of an F11 culture with abiomass concentration of 119 mg l
−1. The purity of the
inoculum was checked by spreading diluted suspensions ofthe F11 culture onto nutrient agar (NA) plates. The in-oculum was recirculated through the packed column for3.5 days at a flow rate of 10 ml h
−1to allow colonization of
the support material. The decrease (>90%) in the optical

dication of biomass loading onto the GAC. The UFBR wasthereafter operated continuously, under no aseptic condi-tion, at room temperature and pH 7, and was fed with asynthetic aqueous stream consisting of MM and differentconcentrations of FB.
Sampling and analyses Liquid samples were routinely col-
lected at the inlet and outlet of the UFBR (Fig. 1) for
analysis of FB and the respective biodegradation product,fluoride. For quantification of FB losses through vaporiza-tion, gas samples were collected from the reactor headspacewith a gas-tight syringe and immediately analyzed on GCby injection of 0.5 ml. Dissolved oxygen was weeklymonitored in the reactor liquid outlet with an oxygen probe(WTW, Germany).
FB was analyzed by gas chromatography as described by
Carvalho et al. ( 2005 ). The concentration of fluoride ions in
the culture supernatant was measured, after centrifuging thesamples, with an ion-selective combination electrode(model CH-8902, Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Urdorf, Switzer-land), which was calibrated with NaF (0.1 –10 mM) in MM.
Biofilm microbial community analysis (1) Biofilm sam-
pling: GAC samples (1 g of wet weight) were collectedfrom two sampling points of the bioreactor (11 and 21 cmfrom the bottom, Fig. 1). For extraction of biomass from
the carrier surface, GAC samples were dispersed in 10 mlof NaCl solution (8.5 g l
−1) and vortexed for 30 s at maxi-
mum speed. The resulting suspensions were used for platecounts and DGGE analyses. Effluent samples (1 ml) werecollected at the outlet of the bioreactor for bacterial enu-meration through plate-count analysis. (2) Plate counts:Bacteria were enumerated by plating onto NA, in duplicate,serial dilutions of samples in NaCl solution (8.5 g l
−1).
The plates were incubated at 25°C for 3 days. (3) DNAextraction: Prior to DNA extraction, approximately 8.5 mlof the bacterial suspensions detached from GAC werecentrifuged and washed twice with sterile deionized water.The pellet was kept at −20°C until DNA was extracted.
DNA extraction was performed using the UltraClean Mi-crobial Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio, California).(4) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions: The gen-eral eubacterial primers 341F-GC and 518R, specific forthe hypervariable V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, wereused for amplification of a fragment corresponding topositions 341 to 534 of the Escherichia coli numbering
(Schäfer and Muyzer 2001 ). A 39-bp GC clamp was at-
tached to the 5 ′end of the forward primer in order to prevent
the complete melting of the PCR products during subsequentDGGE analysis. PCR amplification was performed in atotal volume of 50 μl; each PCR mixture contained 10 ng of
template DNA, 2.5 mM of MgCl
2, 1.5 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Fermentas, Lithuania), 250 μM of each dNTP,
and 50 μM of each primer. PCR products were amplified

with a DCodeTM Universal Mutation Detection System(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Samples con-taining approximately equal amounts ( ≈500 ng) of the
PCR products were loaded ont o 8% (wt/vol) polyacryl-
amide gels (37.5:1, acrylamide: bisacrylamide) in 0.5×TAE buffer (20 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.4, 10 mM sodiumacetate, 0.5 mM Na
2EDTA) using a denaturing gradient
ranging from 35 to 50% (100% denaturant contains 7 M
urea and 40% formamide). Electrophoresis was performeda t6 0 ° Ci n1 ×T A Eb u f f e r ,i n i t i a l l ya t2 0V( 1 5m i n )a n dthen at 200 V (330 min). The gels were stained with anethidium bromide solution (5 min) and then rinsed indistilled water (20 min). The image was acquired using aDigiDoc-IT Imaging System (Ultra-Violet Products, Ltd,
Cambridge, UK). (6) Analysis of the community finger-print: Gel images were analyzed with the Diversity Data-base Fingerprinting software (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA,USA). Every gel contained one lane with a standard of eightbands to facilitate the identification of bands occupying thesame position in the different lanes of the gels. A binarymatrix was constructed taking into account the presence orabsence of individual bands in each lane. A similarity ma-trix was generated using the Bray –Curtis coefficient in the
PRIMER v5 software (PRIMER-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK).Dendrograms were generated using the same software,using the group average method.
Reagents All chemicals used were of the highest purity
grade available (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Steinheim, Ger-many; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). GAC (8 –20 mesh)
was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO,USA.

Similarities were calculated
using the Bray –Curtis measure559aqueous stream (l d−1); and Vis the working volume of the
UFBR (dm3).
The overall operational performance of the UFBR is
shown in Figs. 2and3, and the main results obtained in
each phase throughout the operation of the bioreactorare summarized in Table 1. During the first three phases
(I–III), similar organic loads (OL) (between 90 and 130 mg
d−1dm−3) were fed to the UFBR, with a hydraulic resi-
dence time (HRT) of 24.5 h. Under these circumstances,the UFBR showed a step increase in both the BRE andBEC, reaching in phase III values of ≈49% and 44 mg d
−1
dm−3, respectively. From phase IV, the HRT was reduced
to 16.7 h. During phases IV to VII, a range of FB con-centrations between ≈40 and 180 mg l−1were fed to the
UFBR. Phases IV and V were characterized by a signif-icant increase in the OL applied to the UFBR (up to260 mg d
−1dm−3). A decrease in the BRE was imme-
diately observed, in spite of the continuous increase inthe BEC to ≈75 mg d−1dm−3. When the OL was decreased
to about 150 mg d−1dm−3(phase VI), the BEC continued
to increase and a visible improvement in the BRE wasobserved, achieving a value 2.3 times higher than the BREobtained in the previous phase. In phase VII, the OL wasfurther decreased to ≈60 mg d
−1dm−3, and during this
phase, the UFBR showed the highest BRE ( ≈146%). A
BRE value higher than 100% indicated that the biofilmwas highly active, biodegrading both the FB fed in theinfluent and the FB previously adsorbed onto the GACsupport. On day 142, feed of FB to the bioreactor wastemporarily stopped (phase VIII), and during this phase,fluoride release continued to occur (Fig. 2), again in-
dicating that the biofilm was degrading the FB adsorbedto the GAC. In phase IX, FB was reintroduced to theUFBR with an OL of ≈70 mg d
−1dm−3, during which a
BEC similar to that obtained in the previous phase (phaseVIII) and a BRE of ≈65% were achieved, indicating that
the degrading biofilm remained active after the period ofsubstrate suspension.
The headspace of the UFBR was monitored daily to
quantify for volatilization losses of FB from the system. FBwas never detected in the headspace, indicating that bio-logical degradation and adsorption to the GAC were themain removal mechanisms. Dissolved oxygen concentra-tions were routinely measured in the bioreactor effluent,and oxygen concentrations above 4.5 mg l
−1were always
found, indicating that the UFBR system was not oxygenlimited.
Bacterial community dynamics in the biofilm reactor
Microbial community analyses were performed along the
UFBR operation. Bioreactor population was quantifiedthrough the counting of viable bacteria resultant from theGAC extraction and from the reactor effluent (Fig. 4).
The biomass attached to the GAC did not suffer sig-nificant variations along time in both sampling points ofthe bioreactor, with the counts found for bottom samplingpoint being, in general, slightly higher than that for topsampling point. Significant numbers of bacterial cells were
always detected in the bioreactor effluent, indicating bac-terial detachment from the biofilm structure.
Bacterial suspensions extracted from GAC were also
analyzed by DGGE (Fig. 5). The total number of band
positions detected in the two gels was 14, and the numberof DGGE bands per sample varied between 7 and 12. Ingeneral, the band patterns were quite similar along time andin the two sampling points, with slight differences beingobserved mainly during the start-up of the reactor opera-tion. F11 strain was detected in all samples, although theintensity of its band in the DGGE gels varied along time. Atsome time points, GAC was sampled in duplicate, and theresulting bacterial suspensions were analyzed by DGGE totest the reproducibility of the results. Identical band pat-terns were always obtained for the analyzed duplicates(data not shown).
Cluster analysis was performed to study general patterns
of community similarity among the different samples(Fig. 6). This analysis corroborates the existence of a
quite stable community along bioreactor operation, withno crucial changes found between the two sampling points.At bioreactor start-up, the settled community was very sim-ilar between the two sampling points (Fig. 6,P 1 –T0 and
P2–T0), but clearly constituted a cluster more distantly
related to the samples from subsequent time points. Thebacterial communities from both sampling points at T2 –T7
grouped closely to one another. The T8, T9, and T10 timepoint samples clustered more according to time factor thanwith spatial distribution along the reactor, as some dif-ferences were found between the two samplings points.Samples T11 –T14 exhibited no significant changes be-
tween one another.
Discussion
This work aimed at evaluating the biodegradation of FBin a UFBR packed with GAC under a continuous flowmode regime, while assessing the microbial dynamicsalong the bioreactor operation. A range of FB concentra-tions between 0 and 180 mg l
−1was selected for the bio-
reactor experiments to avoid pronounced toxic effects onmicrobial degradation, as previous studies conducted inbatch mode with strain F11 revealed that this compoundhas a strong inhibitory effect on this microorganism, com-pletely inhibiting growth at concentrations ≥375 mg l
−1
(Carvalho et al. 2005 ). These studies also showed that
strain F11 slowly degrades FB, and thus, high HRTs werechosen to operate the UFBR.
Along 246 days of UFBR operation, a total of 4,350 mg
of FB was fed to the bioreactor, of which 2,190 mg ( ≈50%)
was biodegraded, as indicated by fluoride release. PreviousGAC adsorption studies suggested that the adsorption ca-pacity of the GAC used to pack the UFBR would not beexhausted during the whole period of bioreactor opera-tion, thus assuring that the benefits obtained from the dualmechanism adsorption/biodegradation would be main-tained until the end of bioreactor operation.560During the first three phases of the UFBR operation,
the OL applied to the reactor did not change substantiallyin order to allow development of the biofilm before ap-plying higher organic loads to the bioreactor. Both BECand BRE progressively increased during these phases,indicating a gradual adaptation of the biofilm to the op-erational conditions. When the OL was considerably in-creased during phases IV and V , a decrease in the BREwas observed, suggesting that these high organic loadsapplied to the UFBR, which were mainly achieved throughthe increasing of the FB concentration in the influent, mayhave caused an inhibitory effect on the microbial biofilm.As the system was buffered by the GAC adsorption ca-pacity, this inhibitory effect was probably mainly inducedin the bioreactor section closer to the influent, thus af-fecting mostly the microbial population resident in thisarea. The step decrease in the OL, applied to the UFBRduring phases VI and VII, produced an improvement inthe biodegradation activity, thus supporting the idea thathigh concentrations of FB may be inhibitory. During phaseVIII, characterized by the absence of FB feeding, fluoridecontinued to be released, indicating that the biofilm wasdegrading the FB previously adsorbed onto the GAC.This result highlights the important role of GAC in bio-reactor systems, in which it acts not only as a buffer byadsorbing high concentrations of the influent pollutants(Khodadoust et al. 1997 ; Moteleb et al. 2002 ), but also as
a stock of the pollutant fed (Abu-Salah et al. 1996 ;
Ivancev-Tumbas et al. 1998 ). When FB was not fed to the
system, the biodegradation activity observed in the UFBRindicated that the adsorbed FB became bioavailable. Inaddition, it was demonstrated that bioregeneration of thematrix surface is feasible, contributing to extending thebed life of the adsorption matrix. The occurrence of bio-regeneration in biologically activated carbon systems hasbeen shown in studies with other pollutants (Speitel et al.1989 ;S h ie ta l . 1995; Jonge et al. 1996;C a l d e i r ae ta l . 1999).
The biofilm survival and, especially, its activity main-
tenance under non-operating conditions constitute a veryimportant feature in biotreatment processes, as periods ofsubstrate absence are a common scenario found in indus-try, resulting from interruptions of the industrial processleading to periods with no effluents to be treated. Immo-bilized reactors represent a good strategy to obviate thisproblem, and some studies report the capacity of suchreactors to deal with this scenario (Hekmat et al. 1997 ; Sun
and Wood 1997 ; Carvalho et al. 2001 ; Nandy and Kaul
2001 ). In this study, the presence of GAC in the UFBR
guaranteed the continuous supply of FB to the microbialbiofilm when the substrate feeding was temporarilystopped, thus preventing the microorganisms from suffer-ing from absence of substrate. Thus, from a microbial pointof view, the feeding of FB to the UFBR was always con-tinuous, and this allowed the bioreactor to face the re-establishment of the FB feeding in phase IX as a continuousprocess rather than as a start-up process.
Reactor performance and community structure are two
important components in a biodegradation process. In thisstudy, the composition of the bacterial communities wasanalyzed both by plate counting and DGGE. No significant
differences in bacterial counts along bioreactor operationwere found. Slightly higher numbers of colony-formingunits (CFUs) were frequently found in the samples col-lected from the bottom of the bioreactor, which can be dueto the fact that this point is located closer to the influent.DGGE analysis provided data on the microbial diversitywithin the UFBR system. The major shift in the microbialcommunity structure was observed during the start-up ofthe reactor. Time point T0, which corresponds to the anal-ysis of GAC after inoculum adsorption and before thebeginning of bioreactor operation, revealed the presence ofeight and nine different bands in the top and bottomsampling points, respectively, indicating colonization ofbacteria other than the original inoculum. This colonizationoccurred, most probably, throughout the UFBR inoculationperiod, during which an F11 culture was recirculated undernonsterile conditions to allow for the biofilm establish-ment. The occurrence of bacteria other than the inoculumfed initially to the UFBR suggests that these bacteria wereable to tolerate the presence of FB, growing, most prob-ably, at the expense of FB degradation intermediates. Gen-erally, no significant differences were found between thetwo sampling points located at different axial positions inthe UFBR. The major exceptions were found for samplestaken at time points T8, T9, and T10, which revealed somedifferences between the two sampling points. Time pointsT8 and T9 coincided with phase V of reactor operation,during which a higher FB concentration was applied to theUFBR ( ≈180 mg l
−1). This may have contributed to the
smaller microbial diversity observed in the bottom samplepoint, as a result of a more pronounced FB toxicity effectexperienced in this reactor axial position. A similar sce-nario was found when the FB concentration in the feed waslowered to about 107 mg l
−1, which corresponded to time
point T10. In general, the DGGE analysis of the UFBRalong time showed a quite stable microbial community, aresult that has also been reported by several authors duringthe treatment of other aromatic compounds such as styreneand mixtures of benzene, toluene and p-xylene (BTX)
(Massol-Deyá et al. 1997 ; Tresse et al. 2002 ; Smith et al.
2003 ), although other studies show variability in microbial
composition (LaPara et al. 2002 ; Schlötelburg et al. 2002 ;
Casserly and Erijman 2003 ). In the present study, the mi-
crobial stability observed during the UFBR operationmight be a result of the strong selective pressure providedby the presence of FB. Strain F11 remained in the UFBRalong the overall period of the bioreactor operation, sug-gesting that the presence of this strain is essential for thedegradation of FB. Moreover, the fact that this strain wasnot out-competed may indicate that the capacity to degradeFB is not easily transferred to other microorganisms.
In conclusion, through a combination of adsorption and
biodegradation, the UFBR used in this study showed acapacity to degrade low-strength aqueous influents con-taining FB. The positive protection offered by GAC, usedas a biofilm support matrix, was particularly noticed duringthe higher organic loading, where it acted as a buffer, andduring the period of absence of substrate feeding, when the561adsorbed FB became bioavailable. In addition, the strong
selective pressure exerted by the presence of FB in thereactor might have contributed to the development of astable biofilm population.
