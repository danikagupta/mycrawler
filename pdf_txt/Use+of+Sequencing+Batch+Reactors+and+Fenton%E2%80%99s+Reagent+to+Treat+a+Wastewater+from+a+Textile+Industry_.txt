Abstract 
A petroleum refinery is a complex combination of interdependent industrial 
processes that generate wastewater effluent containing hydrocarbons, heavy 
metals and dissolved minerals which cause harmful effects to human and 
environment. While physicochemical sy stems are widely accepted as effective 
methods for treatment of industrial wastewater, biological processes are 
beginning to play an increasing role in the treatment of metal containing 
effluents. The objective of the present study is to investigate the biological 
treatment of refinery wast ewater containing nickel . The SBR performance was 
assessed by measuring Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Mixed Liquor 
Suspended Solid (MLSS), Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solid (MLVSS) as 
well as nickel concentrations. The SBR was operated on a 12-hour cycle basis 
which consisted of five distinct modes:  fill, react, settle, draw, and idle. The 
wastewater was brought from an equalizat ion tank of a refinery plant and was 
fed to the reactor after characterization.  The nickel concentration ranged from 
2.3 to 2.6 mg/L. The experimental results demonstrate COD and nickel removal 
efficiencies of 70–90% and 77–80%, respectively. 
Keywords: refinery wastewater, se quencing batch reactor, nickel. 
1 Introduction 
Large amounts of water are being utilized in petroleum refinery industry for 
cooling, desalting and dehydration processes [1, 2]. Refining process generate 
wastewater 0.4-1.6 times the volume of crude oil processed [1]. The most 
important pollutants are hydrocarbons, phenol and dissolved minerals that are

,referred as priority pollutants [3], 80% of which may be considered hazardous 
because of the presence of toxic organics and heavy metals such as  nickel even 
at very low concentrations [2, 4].  
     Nickel is one of the toxic heavy metals present in petroleum refinery 
wastewater [4, 5]. Nickel is commonly found in crude oils and need to be 
removed due to its ability to poison the catalysts activities in refining process [6]. 
In addition, residual feedstock at fluidized bed catalytic cracking units have 
higher metals content especially nickel and greater coke form ing potential than 
distillate feeds. This contaminant reduces  catalysts activity, promotes coke and 
hydrogen formation and leads to decrease gasoline yield due to its deposition on 
the catalyst [7]. Discharge of untreated pe troleum refinery wast ewater containing 
nickel into water bodies results in environmental and human health problems [5]. 
Accumulation of nickel in the body can  cause lung fibrosis, cardiovascular, 
kidney diseases and act as carcinogenic agent [8–10]. Excessive concentrations 
of nickel in water affect the living organism’s growth such as algae [10]. 
     Studies conducted on wastewater treatment containing heavy metals using 
chemical precipitation, coagulation-flocculation, flotation, membrane filtration 
and ion exchange indicated that thes e technologies are costly and produce 
excessive sludge [3, 4, 12]. Biological wastewater treatment systems are rapidly 
gaining support as the option is being shown to be technologically and 
economically feasible [11, 12]. Biological system is simple to operate and cost 
effective due to the use of microorganisms. Microorganisms play an important 
role in oxidizing dissolved and particulate carbonaceous organic matter into 
simple end products. 
     SBR is a biological method that  has several advantages compared to the 
activated sludge process. Application of  SBR is feasible since the system 
operates in a simple tank and the need of  a clarifier is eliminated. Moreover, 
SBR system is also flexible in operation, controllable in reaction time and has 
perfect quiescent settling [13–15]. SBR gives high efficiency in Biochemical 
Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Suspended Solid (SS) removal (89–98% and 85–
97%, respectively) [14].  
     The objective of this research is  to evaluate the performance of SBR in 
presence of nickel in refinery wastewater treatment. 
2 Materials and methods 
2.1 Sampling procedures  
Refinery wastewater was collected from equalization tank unit.  It was then 
brought to the university Environmental Engineering Laboratory and stored in a 
cool room at 4oC. A portion of the sample was brought to room temperature and 
analyzed for COD, BOD 5, TSS, pH, turbidity, alkalinity, colour, nitrate, 
phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, phenol, sulphide, sulphate and nickel. Analyses 
were conducted based on Standard Method for the Examination of Water and 
Wastewater [16]. pH and turbidity we re measured using a pH meter (HACH 
sension 4) and a turbidimeter (HACH 2100P). Dissolved oxygen (DO) was

performance of SBR was monitored by measuring the COD, MLSS, MLVSS and 
nickel concentrations. Analyses were ca rried out in triplicate and the standard 
deviation was calculated respectively. 
2.2 Seeding materials 
The SBR was started with the adding of  seed sludge collected from treatment 
facility of same refinery plant for faster start-up. The volume of seed sludge 
added to the system was based on F/M ratio as in eqns (1) and (2). 
 Q = cycle inNV  (1) 
 F/M = MLVSSVCODQin
.. (2) 
where Q is the wastewater flow rate (L/d),  Vin is the influent feed volume per 
cycle (L/cycle), Ncycle is the number of cycle per day, V is the volume of the SBR 
(L) and MLVSS  is the sludge concentration in the reactor (mg/L). 
2.3 Experimental setup 
SBR was operated using a fill and draw periodic system with a total working 
volume of 4 L. The reactor was seeded with sludge and fed with wastewater 
from the equalization tank. The SBR was operated on a 12 h cycle basis which 
composed of fill (15 min.), reaction (585 min.), settle (60 min.), draw (15 min.) 
and idle (45 min.). An aquarium pump (Hailea ACO-9610, China) was used in 
the system to supply sufficient air to th e reactor with an air flow rate of 4.5 
L/min. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Fig.1 illustrates 
the schematic diagram of the SBR.

3.1 Refinery wastewater characteristics 
Table 1 shows the petroleum refinery wa stewater characteristics. The results 
indicate a low BOD 5 of 94.1 ± 3.80. BOD 5 for refinery wastewater is lower than 
municipal wastewater due to small concen tration of organic materials that are 
partially biodegradable [17].  A study conducted by Misbahudin et al.  also 
reported low BOD 5 in petrochemical wastewater [18]. Both COD and nickel 
concentrations (405 ± 11.59 and 2.3 ± 0.01, respectively) exceeded Standard B 
by Department of Environmental Malaysia (DOE); stipulated in Environmental 
Quality Act 1974 and the Environmental Quality Regulations (Sewage and 
Industrial Effluents) 2009 [19]. According to DOE Standard B, the allowable 
concentrations for COD and nickel are 100 and 1.0 mg/L respectively. In 
addition, other parameters such as ammonia nitrogen, colour, sulphide and 
phenol also exceeded DOE Standard B.

3.2 COD analysis 
SBR was operated and its performance was monitored for 77 days based on 
COD analyses. At start-up of SBR, wast ewater was mixed with seed materials 
and being acclimatized. Acclimation period is necessary in order to expose the 
microbial community to the potentially inhibitory or toxic organic compounds 
 
 www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) WIT Transactions on Ecology and The Environment, Vol 164, ©201 WIT Press 2406  Water Pollution XIpresent in wastewater [20]. Moreover, acclimatization period is important for 
development of metabolic systems such as appropriate enzyme-producing genes 
that are essential to encourage biod egradation [11, 20, 21]. The final COD 
concentration and COD removal effi ciency are shown in fig. 2. 
 
 
Figure 2:  Final COD concentration and C OD removal efficiency (%). 
     From the beginning until day 9, the system was unstable based on fluctuation 
of COD concentration.  This shows that the microorganisms were still not able to 
adapt with the new environment. From day 10 to 42, COD removal efficiency 
started to gradually reach constant valu es. Adaptation of microorganisms to the 
system can be indicated by monitoring effluent COD which is reaching constant 
values [13]. This indicates that microor ganisms in the system have acclimatized 
after day 9 and the SBR is ready to recei ve higher nickel dosage. Therefore, 
nickel concentration which was 2.3 mg/L at the beginning was increased to 
2.4 mg/L on day 43 and 2.6 on day 60 after achieving steady state conditions in 
the system. Addition of 2.4 mg/L and 2.6 mg/L higher nickel dosage leads to 
decreased COD removal efficiency in bot h dosages. Relatively low concentration 
of heavy metals may serve to stimulate biological systems. However, any 
increase in concentration of toxic ma terials may decrease stimulation and 
eventually result in the system becoming inhibited [15, 22]. While, nickel with 
concentrations of 2.4 and 2.6 mg/L were introduced to the system, 
acclimatization was achieved based on  COD removal efficiency after each 
increment in nickel concentration. However, the system was not able to produce 
less polluted effluent as compared to the duration where it was operated with 
lower nickel dosage. It shows that after receiving a higher dosage, the system 
becomes inhibited and decreases COD rem oval efficiency.  Overall, the final 
COD concentration met DOE Standard B. 
3.3 MLSS and MLVSS analysis 
MLSS and MLVSS were analyzed to measure the microorganism’s 
concentration in the system. MLSS indicat es the presence of volatile and inert 
 
 www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) WIT Transactions on Ecology and The Environment, Vol 164, ©201 WIT Press 2Water Pollution XI   407solids in the sludge. MLVSS closely appr oximates the biologically active portion 
of the solid in the sludge [11]. Chan et al.  [13] reported that  the acclimatization 
phase might be achieved when the MLVS S concentration is increased steadily. 
This trend reflects the active growth of bacteria which indicates the success of 
adaptation [13]. The bacteria utilize organic matters and multiply to form new 
cells. An adequate MLVSS concentration has to be maintained to ensure 
sufficient biomass concentration for biological reactions. Process operations with 
low MLVSS will lead to poor bio-flocculation, inadequate entrapment of 
particulate organic matter and bad settling of activated sludge [23]. Results 
shown in fig. 3 indicate stable MLVSS concentration throughout the experiment. 
It was due to proper selection of F/M ratio and perhaps high concentration of 
acclimatized microorganisms in  the collected sludge fr om refinery wastewater 
treatment plant. However, decrease in MLSS and MLVSS concentration at 
certain days on nickel addition to the SBR affects SBR system performances.  
 
 
Figure 3:  MLSS and MLVSS concentration. 
 
3.4 Nickel removal 
The SBR system reduces nickel concentration ranging from 0.48 to 0.53 mg/L 
(78.7%) and from 0.53 to 0.55 mg/L (79.2%) for nickel’s initial concentration of 
2.4 and 2.6 mg/L, respectively. Results of final nickel concentration and its 
removal efficiency (%) are shown in fig.  4. Nickel removal efficiency dropped 
after introduction of higher nickel dosage . Studies reported on the same trend as 
microorganisms are affected with the add ition of higher nickel dosage leads to 
decrease of nickel removal efficiency. Ho wever, nickel removal efficiency will 
start to increase once the microorganisms are adapted with new higher nickel 
dosage [24–26]. Final nickel concentration was below 1.0 mg/L which meets the 
DOE Standard B discharge limit.

4 Conclusions 
Physicochemical treatments of wastewater have been used vastly for heavy 
metals removal such as nickel. However, those treatments involve high cost and 
production of excessive sludge. Biologi cal systems are suitable choice as they 
are cheap and have high efficiency of  contaminants removal efficiency. SBR 
systems require small space since no clar ifiers are required. SBR has shown 
successful performance of COD removal e fficiency ranging from 70% to 90% 
and nickel removal efficiency are found  to be up to 79.2% in refinery 
wastewater. This study verifies that SBR is suitable system for heavy metals 
removal i.e. nickel.
