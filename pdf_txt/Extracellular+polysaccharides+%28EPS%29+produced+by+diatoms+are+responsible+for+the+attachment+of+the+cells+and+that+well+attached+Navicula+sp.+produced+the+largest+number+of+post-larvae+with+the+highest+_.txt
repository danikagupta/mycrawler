Abstract  
In the present study, diatom samples were collected from the tropical river systems in Kerala, India. The investigation was d one for a 
period of two years from January 2017 to December 2018. Thirty four species of diatoms belonging to fifteen genera viz. Nitzschia , 
Navicula , Diadesmis , Achnanthidium , Synedra , Encyonema, Sellaphora,  Lemnicola, Eunotia , Pinnularia , Aulacoseira , Surirella , 
Stauroneis,  Gomphonema  and Cymbella were isolated using methods viz. serial dilution, agar plating and single cell isolati on. Out of 
the 34 species isolated and identified, 16 species could be maintained as pure cultures in f/2 medium under laboratory condit ions for 
further analysis viz. standardization of culture conditions and nutrient analysis. Species identification was d one with the help of light 
microscope and scanning electron microscope images. The diatom cells were subjected to acid treatment for analyzing the struc ture and 
morphology. The study was aimed at screening, isolation and identification of the diatoms from freshwater sources and to find out its 
potential as live feeds in the larviculture of fin fish and shell fish species of aquaculture importance and also as a source  for biodiesel 
production.

Introduction
Diatoms belong to the class Bacillariophyceae, which is the major 
group of photosynthetic microalgae found in almost all water 
sources. Over 8000 different species are described growing 
worldwid e in lakes and sea, but according to different authors  [1], 
extant species are estimated to range between 20000 and 200000 
species. These microscopic autotrophic microalgae possess 
highly ornamented cell wall composed of glass silica called 
frustules which provide a variety of shapes from nano - to micro - 
scale st ructures. The size, shape and sculpturing of diatom cell 
walls are taxonomically diagnostic  [2]. 
Microalgae are utilized diversely in aquaculture, but their main 
applications are related to nutrition. They are used as a sole 
component or as a food additive  to supply basic nutrients, color 
the flesh of salmonids or for other biological activities  [3]. 
Microalgae must possess a number of key attributes to be useful 
to aquaculture species. They must be of an appropriate size for 
ingestion and readily digested,  they must have rapid growth rates, 
be amenable to mass culture, and they must have a good nutrient 
composition, including an absence of toxins that might be 
transferred up the food chain  [4]. With the development of the 
mariculture in the last two decades , microalgal cultivation is 
increasing its importance due the fundamental use of microalgae 
for feeding many animal species in aquaculture  [5]. Microalgae 
contain essential nutrients which determine the quality, survival, 
growth and resistance to disease o f cultured animal species  [6]. 
Diatoms are widely used as larval feeds. The small diatoms 
Chaetoceros muelleri, Chaetoceros calcitrans  and Thalassiosira 
pseudonana are used for mollusc culture  [7]; the chain forming 
diatom Skeletonema costatum for larval p rawn culture  [8]; and 
benthic mat forming pennate species (e.g. Nitzschia sp.) for juvenile abalone culture.  PUFAs derived from microalgae, i.e. 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
arachidonic acid (AA) are known to be essential for  various 
larvae  [9]. These are important essential fatty acids required for 
gametogenesis  [10]. When compared to other groups of 
microalgae, diatoms are the only algal group containing a high 
level of cholesterol, the sterol essential for mollusc growth  [11]. 
Diatoms are fed to different fresh water aquaculture animals 
which include fishes such as milk fish, gold fish, etc. and shell 
fishes such as Lamellidens  sp. 
The imminent depletion of world oil reserves and the global 
environmental deterioration associated with the exhaustive 
consumption of fossil fuel have generated renewed interest in 
exploring microalgae as alternative and viable resources of 
renewable biofuels  [12]. The promise of diatoms as potential 
candidates for biodiesel arose from the fa ct that most species 
synthesize considerable amounts of glycerides (monoglycerides, 
diglycerides and triglycerides) which are the key lipid feedstock 
of biodiesel [13].The present study was aimed at the identification 
of diatoms from the microalgal sample from fresh water sources 
which can be used as potential live feeds in the field of 
larviculture. Number of studies has been done on the marine 
diatoms for their nutritional value. But fresh water diatoms 
undergo very few studies on their distribution, bioc hemical 
composition and nutritional importance.  
 
2. Materials and methods  
2.1 Collection of diatom sample  
The microalgal samples were obtained from the rocks and 
macrophytes collected from the river. Diatoms were removed by International Journal of Ecology and Environmental Sciences

60 vigorously scrubbing the upper surface  of the rocks with a small 
brush to dislodge the diatom community. For separating diatoms 
from macrophytes  the plant parts were placed in a plastic bag 
together with enough stream water. The plants were shaken 
vigorously and squeezed in the plastic bag and the resulting 
brown suspension was poured into a sample bottle. Plankton net 
(40 microns) was also used t o get the free floating diatoms from 
the upper surface of the stream. The collected samples were 
brought to laboratory in containers along with water taken from 
the sample site for further analysis i.e. isolation and identification  
[2].  
 
2.2 Isolation  
For isolating diatom species three methods were adopted such as, 
agar plating, serial dilution and single cell isolation. Serial 
dilution involved five steps. First, 9 ml f/2 medium was taken in 
5 test tubes each and 1ml diatom sample was added to the first 
test tube. The tube was shaken well and from this tube 1ml sample 
was transferred to the second tube. The procedure was continued 
up to the fifth test tube. Thus the dilution series is 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, 
10-4 and 10-5. The diluted sample was then kept for g rowth  [14].  
For preparing agar plates, 1% agar was prepared by adding 1gm 
of agar to 100 ml of filtered and sterilized freshwater. The agar 
solution was then autoclaved and f/2 medium was added to it for 
enriching algal growth. Then it was poured in to sterilized Petr i dishes and kept for 24 hours. One drop microalgal sample was 
then spread on the agar medium present in each Petri plate. After 
spreading, the Petri dishes were kept for 4 -6 days, providing 1500 
lux light with a photoperiod of 12 hours light: 12 hours dar k and 
25ºC temperature. Within this time the microalgal groups present 
in the sample form different colonies. Later each colony was 
separated and spread on another plate to obtain monoculture.  
In single cell isolation Pasteur pipette was used. The desired 
organism was sucked in through the pipette and was transferred 
to a test tube containing f/2 medium. Thus the organism was 
allowed to grow.  
 
2.3 Identification  
For identifying the diatoms, the frustules were cleaned and 
subjected to acid treatment  [2]. The treated samples were studied 
under light microscope for identification. Scanning electron 
microscope analysis was also done to confirm the identification 
of the diatoms. The diatoms obtained through laboratory pure 
cultures were identified by consulting various literatures  [15, 16, 17, 
18], monograph  [19] and books [2, 20, 21, 22]. 
 
3. Results

65 4. Discussion  
Among the phytoplankton, diatoms are one of the dominating 
group of organisms. Diatoms are among the most productive and 
environmentally flexible eukaryotic microalgae on the planet  [23]. 
Notably, United States Department of Energy (USDOE) had 
collected over 3,000 strains of oil -producing organisms, which 
after screening, isolation and characterization efforts, the 
collection was narrowed down to 300 species, mostly green algae 
and diatoms.  60% of these were diatoms, which were chosen 
based on criteria such as high growth rates and lipid yields, 
tolerance of harsh environmental conditions, and performance in 
large -scale cultures  [12]. 
Microalgae composed of one diatom and one or more flagell ates, 
assure a better balance in essential nutrients  [24]. Microalgae feeds 
are currently used mainly for the culture of larvae and juvenile 
shell and finfish, as well as for raising the zooplankton required 
for feeding of juvenile animals  [25]. They are r equired for larval 
nutrition during a brief period, either for direct consumption in 
the case of molluscs and peneid shrimp or indirectly as food for 
the live prey, mainly rotifers, copepods and Artemia nauplii, 
which in turn are used for crustaceans and f ish larvae feeding  [3, 
7]. Several diatoms routinely cultured in mollusc hatcheries lead 
to good performances in the aspects of larval survival and 
metamorphosis ( Skeletonema costatum , Thalassiosira 
pseudonana , Chaetoceros gracilis , Chaetoceros calcitrans , 
Chaetoceros calcitrans forma pumilum , Chaetoceros 
tenuissimus ) [26].  
Diatoms are excellent lipid accumulators with a substantial 
portion of the cells’ volume is occupied by lipid droplets that 
accumulated rapidly, especially under Si limitation  [27]. A wide 
variety of TAG composition has been identified in diatoms, with 
fatty acid (FA) side -chains ranging from 14:0, 16:0, 16:1 to 16:1, 
20:5, 22:6 [28]. Also diatoms are unusually high in EPA which is 
not prevalent in chlorophytes  [29, 30, 31]. EPA per forms many vital 
functions in biological membranes and serves as a precursor of a 
variety of lipid regulators in cellular metabolism  [32]. Extracellular 
polysaccharides (EPS) produced by diatoms are responsible for 
the attachment of the cells and that well  attached Navicula  sp. 
produced the largest number of post -larvae with the highest 
survival rate  [33]. 
Using even very small amounts of microalgal biomass can 
positively affect the physiology of animals by improved immune 
response, resulting in growth prom otion, disease resistance, 
antiviral and antibacterial action, improved gut function, 
probiotic colonization stimulation, as well as by improved feed 
conversion, reproductive performance  [34]. Algal diets rich in 
polyunsaturated fatty acids and with high l evels of carbohydrate 
are reported to produce the best growth for juvenile oysters 
(Ostrea edulis)  [35]. and larval scallops (Putinopecten yessoensis)  
[36], while high dietary protein provides best growth for juvenile 
mussels (Myths trossulus)  [37].  
In the present study 34 species of diatoms were identified, out of 
which 16 species could be maintained in the laboratory. Nitzschia  
sp. dominated the diatom sample collected. Nitzschia  sp. can be 
used as live feed for abalone Haliotis iris  which produced rapid 
growth rate of post larvae of these organisms and showed high 
digestion efficiency too  [38]. Nitzschia  sp. is determined to be good 
producer of EPA  [30]. According to the results of various studies 
Navicula  sp. can be used as food for sea scallop larvae  [39]. 
Nitzschia sp. is  capable of accumulating substantial amounts of fat in the biomass [40]. The fresh water diatom Nitzschia palea  is 
reported to have 20 - 25% lipid in its total proximate composition  
[41] Navicula  cf. lenzii  has reported to support high post -larval 
growth and a high survival rate of Haliotis discus  [42]. Nitzschia  
sp., Navicula britannica , N. ramosissima , Navicula  sp. and 
Nitzschia ovalis  were used to culture Haliotis iris  post-larvae  [38]. 
The properties of algae lipids -based biodiesel is largely 
determined by the structure of fatty acids feedstock  [43]. Studies 
indicate that the long chain fatty acids with carbon atoms number 
between C12 and C24 represent suitable feedstock for biodiesel  
[44]. The main raw material for diatom -based biodiesel is the 
enormous range of glycerides (monoglycerides, diglycerides and 
triglycerides) which are hybrid compounds of fatty acids and 
glycerol  [45].
