Direct costSummary
Purpose: Status epilepticus (SE) is a major neurological condition associated with
signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality. No studies to evaluate the cost burden of SE have
been performed to date. This study estimates the direct cost related to an inpatient
admission for SE in an urban academic medical center.
Methods: Cases of SE were deﬁned based on a standard 30 min or greater seizure
duration. The inpatient claims data were analyzed for 192 patients admitted with SE
from 1 July 1993 through 30 June 1994. Patient demographic and clinical character-istics associated with increased cost were identiﬁed using multiple regression. The
direct costs for SE were compared with other common DRGs.
Results: The median reimbursement for a patient with SE was $8417. The average
length of stay for all SE patients was 12.9 days. Age groups (17—45 and 46—64) andetiology (acute CNS) were the only patient factors signiﬁcantly associated with
increased cost. SE patients had 30—60% higher reimbursements than patients
admitted for other acute health problems including acute myocardial infarction orcongestive heart failure.
Conclusions: The direct inpatient costs for SE are high compared with the direct costs
of admissions for other major conditions such as acute myocardial infarction orcongestive heart failure. Data from this study were used to estimate a $4 billion
annual direct cost for inpatient admissions for SE. Given the incidence and the high
costs, further more detailed evaluation of these costs may be useful in assessing theadequacy of reimbursement for this subset of patients with epilepsy.#2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of BEA Trading Ltd.

Studies assessing the cost-of —illness of various neu-
rologic diseases including epilepsy, refractory epi-lepsy, and stroke have demonstrated a higheconomic burden of these diseases on the healthcare system, the patient and their families.
1—8
Because this is a heterogeneous disease, the range
in the costs of epilepsy varied widely, depending on
the method and focus of the analysis, whetherdirect and indirect costs were included, or whetherthe disease is new onset or established.
2,9The
economic burden of epilepsy is high, with the great-est cost per person occurring in the ﬁrst year of
diagnosis and ranging from $917 —3157. The costs in
subsequent years have been estimated to be lower,
ranging from $245 —641.
4,8Status epilepticus (SE)
represents an important subset of the epilepsypopulation because it is a major neurological andmedical condition associated with signi ﬁcant mor-
bidity and mortality.
10—15Estimating the costs attri-
butable to this entity independent of other epilepsydisorders may be important not only because of theseverity of this disease, but also because of the
substantial number of cases. Epidemiologic data
from the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan areadetermined that the annual incidence of SE was41 episodes/100,000 adults per year in the UnitedStates. This would result in approximately 200,000cases occurring each year.
10SE may also occur in
association with other diseases such as metaboliccoma, or may be associated with neurologic condi-
tions such as stroke, tumor or hypoxic brain injury,
further complicating the measurement of the eco-nomic burden of this disease.
12Given the high
incidence and the associated morbidity and mortal-ity of SE
10—12,16,17the economic burden of this
disease is likely to be signi ﬁcant. To date, there
have been no studies that have estimated the costsrelated exclusively to status epilepticus.
Methods used to estimate the economic burden
of epilepsy have varied because of differences inthe inclusion of different components of health carecosts such as the direct medical costs to the healthcare system or to the patient.
4,6,7Indirect costs are
an important contributor to the costs of epilepsy,due to ongoing treatments and visits to the healthcare provider.
4,6—8The majority of publications
that have assessed the costs of epilepsy have used
an annual cost estimate because it is dif ﬁcult to
deﬁne an episode of care for epilepsy.2,5,8,9Unlike
other forms of epilepsy, SE may lend itself better toidentifying an episode of care related to a hospitaladmission. That admission is likely to represent thelargest proportion of direct costs to the health caresystem. Given that the incidence burden of diseaseis substantial, and that the SE events are most likely
to occur in a high health care cost setting, studies toestimate the cost of SE independent of that forother seizures seems warranted.
Data from the NIH Greater Metropolitan Area
Status Epilepticus Data System provided a uniqueopportunity to assess the economic burden to thehealth care system associated with an inpatient
hospital admission for SE. Because the patients
were identi ﬁed prospectively and comorbidity
information was collected the effect of other diag-noses on the direct costs surrounding an episode ofSE could be examined. Finally, costs measured byreimbursement and associated with an SE admis-sion, were compared with those for other acuteadmissions including myocardial infarction, stroke,
and congestive heart failure.
Methods
Case deﬁnition
SE has been de ﬁned for all studies related to this
project using well-established criteria as (1) any
seizure lasting 30 min or longer; or (2) intermittentseizures totaling more than 30 min, between whichthe patient did not regain consciousness.

Population
The Medical College of Virginia of Virginia (MCV)
Commonwealth University prospectively collects
and maintains epidemiologic and clinical data onSE in the Greater Richmond Metropolitan Area Sta-tus Epilepticus Data System.
10,14Data on a subset of
these patients, cases diagnosed and treated at MCVHospital, were used to assess the direct medicalcosts as represented by reimbursement for inpati-ent stays for SE. The inpatient claims data for 192
patients admitted to the MCV Hospital from 1 July
1993 through 30 June 1994 were analyzed to calcu-late the direct economic burden of an episode of SE.
Patients admitted with an admission DRG of acute
myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular hemorrhage,or congestive heart failure in 1994 were identi ﬁed and
claims data were used to estimate the direct costs ofinpatient medical care for these diseases. The direct
costs measured as reimbursement provided a set of
relative comparisons for the same costs associatedwith an admission for SE.
Costs
Because SE is treated primarily in the acute inpa-tient setting, the largest proportion of the costs ofEstimating the economic burden of status epilepticus to the health care system 47medical care for SE are likely to occur during the
inpatient admission in which the SE is diagnosed andtreated. We did not attempt to capture indirectcosts to the health care system, or other indirectcosts such as those incurred by the patient or familyfor treatment of their condition. The purpose of thisstudy was to obtain a measure of the economicburden of SE to the health care system, and to
compare that with the burden for other disease
entities. This was based on the reimbursement toour health care system for a hospital admission forSE. The relative costs for an SE admission versusthose for admissions for three other major diseaseswere compared. The comparison was based on theratio of the reimbursement for admissions to ourinstitution. These results are presented as the ratios
of the average reimbursement amount for an inpa-
tient stay for SE divided by those for a speci ﬁc
diagnosis (acute myocardial infarction, congestiveheart failure or cerebrovascular hemorrhage). Thisratio provides a relative measure of the direct healthcare costs of SE that controls for the potentialvariation in reimbursement rates across institutions.
Analysis
Patients were categorized for analysis into four agegroups: 0 —16, 17 —45, 46 —64 and 65 and older. They
were also categorized by gender and by a dichot-omous race variable (white/black). Etiologies weregrouped into ﬁve general categories as de ﬁned
previously: hypoxia (anoxic and hypoxic insults),
central nervous system (CNS) acute etiologies
(stroke, tumors, trauma and CNS infections),nonCNS acute (metabolic disorders, systemic infec-tions, and drug overdose), withdrawal (alcohol andanti-epileptic drug withdrawal and undermedica-tion for seizures) and cases related to a remoteor congenital origins (resolved stroke, birth injury,or congenital anomaly).
10,17,19,20
Other conditions that were included in the com-
parison of SE to other inpatient stay reimburse-ments were selected based on Diagnosis RelatedGroups (DRG) and International Classi ﬁcation of
Diseases 9th Edition (ICD-9) principle diagnosis.For intracranial hemorrhage, cases with DRG 014and a principle diagnosis of 431, 434.91 wereselected. For CHF, cases with DRG 122 or 124,
associated with a principle diagnosis of 428 were
selected. Acute myocardial infarction casesincluded those with DRG 121, or 122 and a principlediagnoses of 410. Inpatient stays for seizure (whichincluded primarily status stays) had DRGs 024 and025 with a principle diagnoses 345 or 780.3.
The Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Univariate
procedure was used to calculate the mean, medianand interquartile ranges for reimbursement. The
interquartile range is the estimate between the25th and 75th percentile. Nonparametric proce-dures from the SAS Npar1way Procedure, includingthe Median test and the Wilcoxin Rank sumtest were performed to assess differences in reim-bursement across age, race, sex, and etiologicgroupings. For the univariate comparisons, median
costs were used to reduce the impact of a skewed
distribution.
Reimbursement amounts were calculated based
on the natural logarithm of the dollar amount. Usingthe natural log to perform statistical calculationsand then transforming back to dollars reduces theeffect of skewedness of any cost data, and providesa normalized distribution required for linear regres-
sion modeling. The SAS General Linear Models pro-
cedure was used to perform multiple linearregression to identify factors signi ﬁcantly and inde-
pendently associated with increasing cost among SEpatients. Length of stay (LOS) was based on the totalnumber of days for each inpatient stay.
The relative direct cost burden of SE was com-
pared with that for other diagnoses during an acute
inpatient admission. The ratio of the average inpa-
tient reimbursement for SE was divided by theaverage reimbursement amount for other speci ﬁc
conditions including intracranial hemorrhage, con-gestive heart failure (CHF), and acute myocardialinfarction (AMI).
Results
A description and frequency distribution of thestudy population by age group, race, sex, and SEetiology are presented in Table 1 . The estimates of
the median and interquartile range in reimburse-ment for each of the demographic and etiologicgroupings for inpatient stays related to SE are pre-
sented in Table 2 . Reimbursement differed signi ﬁ-
cantly across age groups and across etiologies in thisunivariate comparison. There were no signi ﬁcant
differences by race or gender. Of 192 patientsincluded in this cohort and admitted with a diag-nosis of SE in 1993 —1994, the median inpatient
reimbursement was $8,417 with an interquartilerange of $5592 —$21,155. The average length of
an inpatient stay for these cases was 12.9 days with
an interquartile range of 3 —15 days. The median
direct cost as re ﬂected by reimbursement and aver-
age length of stay for an inpatient hospital stay was$1458 per day.
There was a nearly three-fold signi ﬁcant differ-
ence in the range of cost estimates based on reim-bursement by age group ( P= 0.002). The lowest48 L.T. Penberthy et al.were in the pediatric age group (0 —16 years) and the
highest in the adult age group (17 —45 years) as
shown in Table 2 . A signi ﬁcant, 2.5-fold variation
was observed in reimbursement for SE according toetiology ( P= 0.0008). The highest were for the acute
CNS category and the lowest in the nonCNS Acutecategory. Patients with an etiology of withdrawalfrom alcohol or anti-epileptic drugs had the secondEstimating the economic burden of status epilepticus to the health care system 49

dNonCNS acute is the comparison group for each of the
four other etiologies.highest compared with other etiologies. There were
no signi ﬁcant differences by gender or race.
The results of the multivariate analysis are pro-
vided in Table 3 . Neither race nor gender was
associated with higher costs for inpatient admis-
sions for SE as re ﬂected by reimbursement. As in the
univariate analysis, age and etiology were signi ﬁ-
cant independent predictors of increasing reimbur-sement. The lowest direct costs in the univariateanalysis were found for the pediatric age group (0 —
16 years). Therefore, this group served as the refer-ence group for the multiple regression. Admissions
for SE patients aged 17 —45 and 46 —64 had signi ﬁ-
cantly increased costs over the pediatric age group,a nearly two-fold increase for those age 17 —46, and
a 1.74-fold increase for persons aged 46 —64. How-
ever, reimbursement for inpatient admissions forthose in the oldest age group (65+) were not sig-niﬁcantly higher than for the pediatric age group,
even after adjusting for etiology. SE resulting from a
CNS acute etiology had signi ﬁcantly higher costs
than were seen for persons in any other etiologiccategory, including the reference group (nonCNSacute).
Length of stay varied markedly in patients with
SE. Slightly over half the patients, 104 of 192 (54%)had a LOS of less than one week (data not shown).The reimbursement for patients increased corre-
sponding to an increased LOS. The average reim-
bursement for SE patients with less than a one weekLOS was approximately $7000, that for patients withover one week stay was $32,907. A substantialnumber of the SE patients (10%) had an LOS overfour weeks for an inpatient admission with a result-ing reimbursement of over $60,000 per admission.
Table 4 provides a comparison of the relative
costs of an average inpatient admission for SE com-
pared with other common diagnoses (acute myo-cardial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, andcongestive heart failure). The ratio of costs for SEpatients ranged from 1.63 in patients with intracra-nial hemorrhage to 1.94 compared with patientsadmitted for congestive heart failure.Conclusion
SE is associated with signi ﬁcant direct health care
costs as re ﬂected by reimbursement, both when
associated with other diseases and as an indepen-
dent etiology. The impact of this disease is sub-stantial both because of the high cost and alsobecause of the number of cases, particularly inthe middle-aged and elderly population. In otherstudies of SE, the elderly population was found tohave the highest incidence of SE and an associatedmortality of 34%.
11,17The anticipated rapid expan-
sion of the elderly population over the next two
decades will only increase the economic impact ofthis disease on the Medicare system, reinforcing thenecessity of further evaluating the burden of SEfrom a health policy and reimbursement perspec-tive.
Although the estimate reported in the current
study re ﬂects only the acute episode related to the
hospital admission for status, it provides a measure
of the potential economic impact of this disease.Based on an epidemiologic study of SE by DeLorenzoet al.
10, suggesting that there are approximately
200,000 episodes of SE per year in the U.S. popula-tion, the direct costs to the health care system forSE admissions may be as high as $4 billion per year.This estimate is based on inpatient reimbursement
from one hospital system, but it is similar in mag-
nitude to the estimate by Murray and others of $1.3billion per year for refractory epilepsy.
3The esti-
mated median direct health care costs based onreimbursement of an episode of SE from this ana-lysis were $8417 and were substantially higher thanthe total average annual costs in the initial yearafter diagnosis of $3157 for all epilepsy reported by
Begley.
8The costs from the two studies are not
directly comparable because of differences inhealth care settings and methods of estimation,nevertheless, the results suggest that status repre-sents a portion of the epilepsy population with asigniﬁcantly greater component of direct health
care costs.

bAverage reimbursement = total average amount paid to the hospital for inpatient services provided for each of the diagnoses in
column one (across all payors).Reimbursement may not accurately re ﬂect the
costs of providing health care across differenthealth care settings. However, comparing the ratioof costs within the same health care system for SEand other diagnoses provides a relative measure ofthe magnitude of health care costs associated withan episode of SE. In this study, an inpatient admis-sion for status was associated with a 60 —90% greater
direct cost than that for admissions with other
diagnoses.
Further study is needed to evaluate the addi-
tional direct costs of SE for physician visits, out-patient care, laboratory tests and pharmacycharges as well as emergency department care,and to evaluate in more detail the impact of comor-bid conditions on the LOS and costs for SE. Further,
reimbursement is a measure of the economic bur-
den to the health care system, but may not accu-rately re ﬂect the costs to the entity providing care,
and does not include the direct and indirect costs tothe patient and his family. A study providing infor-mation on the longitudinal health care costs of SEthat includes inpatient and subsequent outpatientcare as well as costs of readmission would provide
important information on the total costs of seque-
lae of this condition. As new treatments for SE aredeveloped, this type of analysis would permit anassessment of their effectiveness from an economicperspective. Given the signi ﬁcant morbidity and
cost burden associated with this diagnosis, furtherefforts towards re ﬁning the costs of this disease are
indicated. The results of a more complete analysis
may be useful in establishing and re ﬁning reimbur-
sement rates or in de ﬁning this disease as an inde-
pendent diagnostic category for reimbursement.
