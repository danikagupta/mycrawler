Abstract : Recently, Nanofiltration plays an important role in dye wastewater treatment. The
efficiency of membrane separation system for wastewater treatment plant is complicated due to
different operating conditions involved in the separation process. Estimation of the
Nanofiltration membrane performance is essential to evaluate the final water quality for further
reuse. This work focus on the development of a simplified predictive model for membrane
performance estimation under a set of parameters. A linear multiple regression model with
coefficient of determination (R2) o f 1 h a s b e e n d e v e l o p e d f o r C O D v a l u e s i n t h e p e r m e a t e
stream, while (R2) of 0.85 for membrane rejection estimation. Seven investigated parameters
have been related to formulate the model. The model has been applied for dye wastewater
scheme comprising Nanofiltration with proper pretreatment. The model has been validated with
an average deviation of 15% for membrane rejection and almost no deviation for COD level
estimation in the permeate stream.
Keywords : Nanofiltration, Membrane separation, Wastewater Treatment, predictive model,
Reactive dye.
1.Introduction
Textile dyeing industry is one of the largest water consuming industries. The effluent wastewater
produced from the dyeing industries contains different chemicals and coloring agents and hence this effluent
requires proper treatment before its discharge (Do and Chem1). The dye house effluents are difficult to be
treated because of the variable composition in the waste stream (Najmeh et al. 2). In addition to color, the textile
wastewater the characteristics of high pH, high COD and low biodegradability (Mohammed3). Textile
wastewater has a dramatic environmental impact and cannot be directly discharged to a receiving water body
(Marrot & Roche 4); therefore, textile wastewater treatment is mandatory due to the high water consumption
rate and the environmental impacts (Chaia-Hung et al. 5).
The major sources of color in textile effluents are the dyes from the dyeing operations. There are three
groups of textile dyes dependent on their state in solution as well as their charge: group N; neutral dyes such as
disperse, vat and Sulphur dyes which are insoluble in water; group C; cationic dyes like basic dyes and group
A; anionic dyes that is to acid, direct and reactive dyes which are soluble in water (Ahmad et al. 6). Furthermore,
as a result of low biodegradability of most of the dye groups used in textile industry, biological treatment by
activated sludge is not always effective due to aerobic biological treatment and oxidizing agent’s resistance
(Jiraratananon et al. 7). An advanced treatment technique is required, especially if the treated wastewater will be
recycled/reused (Kapadan & Kargi 8). Membrane separation is an optimal solution to remove color, COD and
salinity (Aouni et al. 9).

Nanofiltration (NF), is a newly developed membrane technology for various water treatment and
purification purposes (Koyuncu et al.10); (Valentina et al.11). Although, membrane processes require proper
pretreatment techniques, many approaches have been studied to minimize membrane fouling and reduce the
costs (Koyuncu et al. 12). Pretreatment of feed water includes optimization of operating conditions such as pH as
well as chemicals consumption and recovery ratio (Hong & Elinlech13; Koyuncu et al14). Microfiltration (MF)
and ultrafiltration (UF) can be used as a pretreatment step for Nanofiltration (Gozalvez-Zafrilla et al.15; Debik et
al.16; Ong et al.17; Barredo-Damas et al.18; Alventosa-delara et al.19).
Many studies have been carried out on color removal from textile wastewater by Nanofiltration
processes. Lebrun et al., investigated electric field enhanced Nanofiltration process by BQ01 and NF45
membranes in dye removal. The results showed variations in dynamic permeability in the presence of
electrolytes and according to the electrical potential applied (Lebrun et al.20). Fuchs et al., studied membrane
bioreactor (MBR) performance in textile wastewater treatment, and explored its ability to achieve water quality
meeting reuse criteria. COD removal was found to vary between 60 and 95 % and COD levels reduced at lower
volumetric loading rates that was tested (Fuchs et al.21). Das Gupta et al., studied Nanofiltration with MWCO =
400 Dalton to treat the effluent from a textile plant. Reactive black and red dyes were used and the membrane
rejection was up to 92-94 % of the two dyes were achieved respectively, while COD removal was up to 94 % in
cross-flow cell (Das Gupta et al.22).
De et al., studied unstirred batch and cross flow Nanofiltration with MWCO = 400 Dalton to separate
dye from aqueous solutions. Using the experimental results, and model parameters (i.e. the diffusivity of the
so l ute ( D) and re al re te n tion ( R r)) of the membrane were evaluated by optimizing the experimental flux and
permeate concentration profiles (De et al.23).  Chaudhari et al., investigated the color removal of commercially
azo dyes under anaerobic conditions in wastewater. Color removal was achieved up to 99 % in both the dye
containing reactors, whereas  COD removals were up to 95 %, 92 % 94 % in control, orange and black dye
containing reactors, respectively (Chaudhari et al.24).
Woei-Jye & Ismail25, studied the performances of some commercial NF membranes and examined dye
rejection, permeate flux and COD rejection as well as studying the transport mechanisms in NF membrane with
a brief review of transport models of NF membranes. Jahangiri & Aminian26, compare experimental results with
neural network simulation in rejection estimation for two different nanofiltration membranes (NF-90 and DK-
5). Arlindo & Isolina27, studied the influence of osmotic pressure and solute adsorption on permeate flux during
nanofiltration (NF) in dye wastewater treatment. He also predicts the rejection coefficient using the solution-
diffusion model (Tahri et al.28).
2.Methodology
The adopted methodology to come up with the performance indicators of applying nanofiltration
membranes for dye wastewater is as follows:
·Collection and compiling of nanofiltration (NF) current practice in dye wastewater treatment.
·Determination of the governing process parameters.
·A mathematical correlation through multivariate regression to estimate the performance of using NF
membrane in dye wastewater treatment.
·Validation of the regression model using published cases.
3.Results and Discussion
NF data for dye wastewater treatment have been reviewed and analyzed according to technical
characteristics. Different data have been collected and excluded due to lack of total information needed
regarding reactive dye separation using nanofiltration membranes. Table (1), presents compiled data regarding
NF separation systems. The collected data have been refined to determine the parameters governing the
separation process. Membranes used in determining this approach are NF90, NF 270, NF 200, SR90, DK2540F
and 40-40 TS80 TSF. Multiple regression method is used to predict nanofiltration dye rejection and COD in the
permeate values. The correlation developed are based on published data (Arlindo et al.27; Chia-Hung et al.5;
Hassani et al.29; Woei-Jye & Ismail25; Tahri et al.28; Najmeh et al.2; Jahangiri & Aminian26; Ahmed et al.6)Ghada A. Al Bazedi  et al /International Journal of ChemTech Research ,2016,9(10): 232-240. 234
assessed and assembled to formulate the regression model. Eight parameters were selected and investigated, six
are considered as independent variables of the multivariate analysis, and two dependent variables. The
independent variables are membrane flux, pH, dye rejection, trans-membrane pressure, membrane pore size,
COD (in feed and permeate). Tables (2) and (3) shows selected compiled data used for model formulation,
showing a strong relationship between the investigated variables and the estimated values.
The final forms of the formulated correlation are mentioned below in equation (1) and (2)

The results showed that the rejection of reactive dyes by NF membranes highly dependent on the
variation in the salt content of the feed stream and the membrane type (pore size) and independent on the
applied pressure. These results are compatible with the published results of (Chollom et al.34). Salt rejections
and permeate flux rates are dependent on feed pressure, however, for the studied range; no influence was
noticed on the studied variables.Ghada A. Al Bazedi  et al /International Journal of ChemTech Research ,2016,9(10): 232-240. 237
