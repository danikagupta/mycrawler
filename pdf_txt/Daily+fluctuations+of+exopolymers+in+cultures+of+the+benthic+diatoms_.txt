On the function of secretion of extracellular polymeric substances  
by benthic diatoms and their role in intertidal mudflats:
A review of recent insights and views
Abstract
Benthic diatoms produce large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). 
These EPS's are believed to play important roles in physiological as wel as ecological 
processes in intertidal environments. Nevertheless, the function of these EPS's and 
the role they play in mediating physical and biological processes are currently poorly 
understood. This paper attempts to review current insight and views on this topic. 
The focus is on the complexity of EPS, which reveals itself at different levels. It has 
become clear that diatoms secrete different types of EPS. Moreover, the composition 
of EPS may vary among different species. These variations lead to the formation of 
different but distinct and ordered tertiary EPS structures as was shown by confocal 
laser scanning microscopy of diatom aggregates. These structural aspects of EPS 
secreted by benthic diatoms should be taken into account in any research that aims at 
explaining its role in the ecology of intertidal systems.
Introduction
Intertidal mudflats are highly dynamic systems that are characterized by rapid changes 
in environmental variables. Both diumal light- and tidal cycles impact mudflats, 
inducing rapid fluctuations in light, salinity, temperature, water content, oxygen, and 
other environmental parameters. Under submerged conditions, sediment particles are 
transported (eroded from the surface or deposited on top of the mudflat) caused by 
physical processes such as wave action and tidal currents. Hence, the sediment-water 
interface is a highly dynamic environment.
Notwithstanding these dynamic conditions, intertidal mudflats are highly produc­
tive systems in which epipelic diatoms are the most important primary producers 
(Underwood and Kromkamp 1999). They supply the organic matter for the benthic 
(Middelburg et al.  2000) and planktonic foodwebs (De Jonge and Van Beusekom 
1992), and could provide up to 50 % of total primary production in estuaries (Under­
wood and Kromkamp 1999). Epipelic diatoms secrete a considerable part of the 
photosynthetically fixed carbon as Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) that

consist for a large part of carbohydrates (Hoagland et al.  1993; Staats et al.  1999). 
Because of the copious secretion of EPS, diatoms become embedded in a matrix of 
these polymers which are attached to the sediment. These structures are known as 
diatom mats or biofilms and are common in intertidal mudflats. By living in a bio­
film, epipelic diatoms create their own stable microenvironment that allows them to 
cope with the rapidly changing conditions in intertidal mudflats (Decho 1994). 
Moreover, diatom biofilms enhance the stability of the sediment surface by increas­
ing the erosion threshold (Paterson 1997, and references therein, Komman and De 
Deckere 1998). Hence, diatoms have profound effects on the morphodynamics of 
mudflats (Dyer 1998) and influence sediment transport, potentially over the scale of 
whole estuaries (Frostick and Mccave 1979).
In spite of the importance of EPS production by benthic diatoms, the factors that 
control this process as well as its function are poorly understood. The complex inter­
actions that take place between the diatoms and the biological and physical environ­
ment they live in make its study difficult. Therefore an important part of the research 
has been carried out on laboratory cultures of isolated strains of benthic diatoms. 
While it is evidently much easier to study the ecophysiology of EPS-production under 
controlled conditions in pure cultures, it is a strong drawback that the organisms are 
removed from their natural environment. However, the combination of these two 
approaches may give clues that lead to the elucidation of the role of EPS both for the 
diatoms and the biofilm intrinsically as well as for intertidal mudflats as a whole and 
even at the scale of the estuarine ecosystem. This paper attempts to review current 
insights and views on the possible functions of EPS secreted by benthic diatoms in 
intertidal areas.
Methodological considerations of the study of EPS
The most common method to investigate EPS production by benthic diatoms is based 
on its isolation from a sample matrix. However, a universal method for the extraction 
of EPS does not exist and different investigators have developed different protocols 
for the isolation of EPS from cultures (Smith and Underwood 2000; Staats et al.  
1999; Wustman et al.  1998) or from sediment samples (Chiovitti et al.  2003b; De 
Brouwer et al.  2000; Underwood and Paterson 2003; Underwood et al.  1995). Analy­
sis of these fractions has mainly focused on the carbohydrate part of the EPS. 
Although carbohydrates often represent a major part of the EPS secreted by diatoms 
(Bhosle et al.  1995; Staats et al.  1999), it should be kept in mind that other compo­
nents such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids may form part of the EPS matrix 
(Lawrence et al.  2003). EPS-fractions that are recovered by any extraction are prin­
cipally operationally defined and give a priori  no information about their character­
istics, their mechanisms of secretion or their possible functions. Moreover, it is largely 
unknown to what extend these operationally defined extracellular fractions contain 
contaminations originating from intracellular compounds. In diatom cultures, isola­
tion of EPS from the culture supernatant has become an accepted method yielding a 
fraction that is sometimes referred to as ‘colloidal EPS' (Smith and Underwood 2000)
46 A review of recent insights and views
or as ‘soluble EPS' (De Brouwer et al.  2002b). Centrifugation as a procedure to 
separate the cells and their extracellular polymeric compounds would likely avoid 
contamination by intracellular material (Staats et al.  1999), but it also results in 
incomplete recovery of EPS (De Brouwer et al.  2002b; Wustman et al.  1997). In 
order to also collect this more tightly bound EPS, sequential extraction protocols 
have been developed. However, more severe extraction procedures may damage the 
cells leading to contamination of the EPS by intracellular compounds. Hence, any 
protocol must be accompanied by rigorous controls and can not be carelessly 
employed for other organisms. Only few studies have discussed these problems in 
detail "(Nielsen and Jahn 1999). Wustman et al.  (1997) extracted EPS from different 
stalk forming diatoms and followed the extraction procedure by using differential 
interference contrast microscopy (DIC) while visualizing the EPS with alcian blue. 
They showed that extraction of the diatom Achnanthes longipes  using water at 90 °C 
removed the bulk of the intracellular material while the extracellular stalks remained 
intact. These stalks were subsequently removed by hot bicarbonate extraction at 
95 °C. These authors also showed that stalks of the freshwater diatom Cymbella  
cistula  were removed by a treatment at 23 °C in 0.2 M EDTA and trcms-  1,2-diamino- 
cyclohexane-N,N,N,',N'-tetraacetic acid but this procedure did not remove the stalks 
of A. longipes.  This indicates that the characteristics of the EPS vary among diatom 
species emphasizing that extraction protocols must be evaluated for each specific 
case. There are various methods that give clues about possible contamination by 
intracellular compounds. For instance, Staats et al.  (1999) monitored the amount of 
protein in fractions that were extracted by warm (30 °C) water, reasoning that a com­
promised cell membrane would leak and proteins are readily water soluble. De Brou­
wer et al.  (2002b) used the fluorescent marker DIB AC (bis-(l,3-dibarbituric acid) 
which enters cells with a compromised cell membrane, in order to monitor the cell 
integrity of C. closterium  under different extraction protocols. Chiovitti et cd.  (2004) 
showed that the glucose rich material that was extracted using warm (30 °C) water 
consisted of a ß-l,3-glucan, which lead them to conclude that it represented the inter­
nal storage glucan chrysolaminaran rather than EPS. This view is subject of debate 
(Chiovitti et al.  2004; De Brouwer and Stal 2004), but it shows the importance to 
identify the nature of these operationally defined fractions.
Extraction of EPS from sediment samples is even more complicated compared to 
the extraction of cultured cells. One of the main reasons for this is that sediments 
represent ill-defined biological matrices that have a wide range of interactions with 
the sedimentary environment. Sediment particles are coated with organic matter. The 
amount of organic matter adsorbed to sediment particles is inversely related to grain 
size (Bergamaschi et al.  1997). This is because finer sediment particles constitute a 
larger adsorptive area compared to coarser grains. Subsets of extracted organic mat­
ter, commonly analyzed as carbohydrate (Underwood et al.  1995), show a similar 
inverse relationship with grain size (De Brouwer et cd.  2000; De Brouwer et cd.  2003; 
Paterson et al.  2000). Therefore, the presence of carbohydrate does not only depend 
on phototrophic biomass (Underwood and Smith 1998) but also on sediment charac­
teristics. This is especially the case when EPS production is low because of a low 
abundance of microphytobenthos. Additionally, intertidal sediments are inhabited by
J.F.C. de Brouwer, T.R. Neu &  L.J. Stal 47
other organisms than microphytobenthos and these may also produce EPS. Such 
organisms include macrofauna (Meadows et al.  1990), meiofauna (Riemann and 
Schrage 1978) and bacteria (Dade etal.  1990). Although, current knowledge suggests 
that benthic diatoms are the major producers of EPS in intertidal mudflats (Under­
wood and Paterson 2003), the involvement of other organisms in the production, 
modification and degradation of EPS is currently largely unknown.
Another complicating factor in the extraction of EPS from sediments is related to 
sample handling. Sediment samples are often lyophilized prior to the extraction of 
EPS. The advantage of lyophilized samples is that water is removed creating a uni­
form sample matrix. However, several studies have shown that lyophilization causes 
lyses of the diatoms through which intracellular carbohydrates may be co-extracted 
(De Brouwer et al.  2000; Wigglesworth-Cooksey et al.  2001). Hence, the correlation 
between chlorophyll a and carbohydrate which is often reported for intertidal mud­
flats (Blanchard et al.  2000; Underwood and Smith 1998) is possibly in part attrib­
uted to intracellular compounds.
Although the extraction procedures for EPS from cultures of diatoms and field sam­
ples are easy to apply and may seem straightforward, the interpretation of the results 
remains difficult. There is an urgent need for a more comprehensive approach that 
allows tracing back the extracted material to its source. There is probably little to gain 
by optimizing the extraction procedures, hence our efforts should concentrate on the 
analytical side of the extracted material. A comprehensive analysis should give infor­
mation about the origin (i.e. the organisms that produced it or diagenetically altered 
sedimentary organic matter) and allow the distinction between intra- and extracellular 
material. This may be done by using preparative techniques such as size fractionation 
(De Brouwer and Stal 2001; Wustman et al.  1998) or electrophoresis (Chiovitti et al.  
2003a; Puskaric and Mortain-Bertrand 2003). In addition, microscope techniques can 
be used for exopolymer characterization or to monitor the extraction of EPS from 
diatoms.
By using Atomic Force Microscopy Higgins et al.  (2002) identified two different 
types of EPS that differed in mechanical properties. The same technique was used to 
follow the extraction of EPS from Pinnularia viridus  cells (Chiovitti et al.  2003b; 
Higgins et al.  2002). These authors showed that the differences in composition of 
the different carbohydrate fractions were associated with changes in the morphology 
and properties of the cell surface mucilage. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy 
and confocal laser scanning microscopy have been used in combination with the 
application of fluorescently labeled lectins to localize EPS structures in isolated 
diatoms (De Brouwer et al.  2005; Neu 2000; Wustman et al.  1997) or natural photo- 
trophic assemblages (Neu 2000; Norton et al.  1998). Although lectins recognize spe­
cific carbohydrate sequences in the EPS, it is not straightforward to distinguish 
between species specific EPS. By using antibodies raised against species specific 
EPS fractions it has been possible to analyze and localize the distribution o f specific 
intracellular (Chiovitti et al.  2004) and extracellular glycoconjugates (Kawaguchi 
et al.  2003; Lind et al.  1997; Wustman et al.  1998). Furthermore, application of 
antibodies identified the role o f extracellular glycoproteins in gliding movement and 
substratum adhesion (Lind et al.  1997).

Composition of EPS
In addition to quantitative information about exopolymers secreted by the diatoms, 
knowledge about the chemical composition may provide additional clues to under­
stand the mechanism(s) of EPS-excretion and their function(s) in intertidal sediments. 
Generally, diatom-derived EPS-fractions are dominated by carbohydrates, the remain­
ing part being mainly proteins and sulfate-groups (Bhosle et al.  1995; Hoagland et al.  
1993; Staats et al.  1999; Wustman et al.  1997). Therefore, the majority of studies 
investigating the structure of EPS have focused on the analysis of carbohydrates orig­
inating from cultures of benthic diatoms (Allan et al.  1972; Chiovitti et al.  2003b; De 
Brouwer and Stal 2002; Staats et al.  1999; Underwood et al.  2004; Wustman et al.  
1997) or from intertidal sediment samples (Cowie and Hedges 1984; De Brouwer et 
al. 2003; De Brouwer and Stal 2001; De Winder et al.  1999; Taylor et al.  1999). 
Meta-analyses of monosaccharide distributions of EPS-fractions originating from dif­
ferent species of benthic diatoms or from intertidal sediments indicated that consider­
able differences exist in the composition of EPS (Underwood and Paterson 2003). 
Cluster analysis identified two major EPS-types that could further be distinguished 
into 6 groupings within this dataset. Both types of EPS were represented by samples 
from diatom cultures as well as sediments. Based on this analysis, a conceptual model 
of EPS secretion was presented. This model proposed secretion of different groups of 
extracellular glycoconjugates, which could mainly be differentiated in (i) a light- 
dependent production of labile low molecular weight sugars, (ii) light-dependent pro­
duction of a polymeric glucose-rich fraction closely attached to cells and, (iii) light- 
independent production of a more heterogeneous (colloidal) EPS that varied to some 
degree among different species.
In addition, it has become increasingly clear that an extracted EPS fraction does 
not necessarily contain one separate functional type of EPS but may consist of a 
mixture of different polymers. By using pyrolysis-mass spectrometry, Smith & 
Underwood (2000) showed differences in the composition of colloidal EPS produced 
during the logarithmic and stationary phase in cultures of 5 epipelic diatoms. The 
presence of two types of EPS in the colloidal EPS extracts of the diatom Cylindro­
theca closterium  were identified by precipitation of the EPS through a series of 
increasing alcohol concentrations (Underwood et al.  2004). In that study, nutrient 
replete cells produced a complex EPS while nutrient limited cells produced an addi­
tional EPS that had a less complex monosaccharide composition. Furthermore, exam­
ination of EPS-secretion by the diatom Cylindrotheca fusiformis  under N- and P- 
limitation recovered at least three exopolymers with different size distributions of 
which two were different in monosaccharide composition (Magaletti et al.  2004). 
Wustman et al.  (1997) observed that stalks produced by diatoms that caused fouling 
were composed of different parts that were apparently formed by distinctly different 
types of EPS. A detailed characterization of the water-insoluble, bicarbonate-extract- 
able EPS-fraction of A. longipes  showed the presence of polymers in three size ranges 
that were different in composition. Subsequent use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays (ELISA) showed the different locations of these different polymers, and indi­
cated that their concerted action results in the formation of highly structured stalks.

By using a similar approach it was shown that two extracellular glycoproteins of a 
size >200 kDa secreted by the diatom Craspedostauros australis  were involved in 
adhesion of the cell to a substratum as well as in cell motility while two smaller 
glycoproteins (87 and 112 kDa) formed a non-adhesive cell surface mucilage. The 
above mentioned examples not only show that benthic diatoms are able to secrete 
compositionally distinct types of EPS that may serve different functions, they also 
indicate that self assembly of extracellular components lead to the formation of com­
plex structural biocomposites. It has been emphasized that the formation of these 
extracellular complexes rather than the secretion of a single substance are important 
for diatom functionality such as motility and adhesion to a substratum (Wetherbee 
et al.  1998).
Another important aspect of EPS-secretion concerns the uniformity of EPS-com- 
position among different species of benthic diatoms. Variations in monosaccharide 
composition have been observed among EPS obtained from different benthic dia­
toms. Unfortunately, experimental conditions under which the diatoms were grown 
as well as the extraction protocols were not uniform. This might have influenced the 
outcome of the analyses of EPS and it is therefore not opportune to draw conclusions 
based solely on the comparison of monosaccharide composition. Only few studies 
have been published that used linkage analysis to identify substitution patterns in the 
EPS of diatoms (Chiovitti et al.  2003a; Chiovitti et al.  2003b; Wustman et al.  1997). 
In general, these investigations showed the presence of complex heterogeneous glyco- 
conjugates. Comparison of glycoconjugates from different diatoms suggests that their 
structure is highly species specific.
Another approach is to combine destructive structural analysis of carbohydrate 
fractions from different diatom species and non-destructive visualization of glyco­
conjugates using lectins. Lectins are proteins that lack enzymatic or immunogenic 
activity and that possess specific carbohydrate and protein binding sites (Neu and 
Lawrence 1999). Lectins have mostly been characterized by its specificity for certain 
monosaccharides, although it has become increasingly evident that complex glyco­
conjugates are probably the more competitive binding sites. Monosaccharide compo­
sitions in four different carbohydrate fractions extracted from three different species 
of benthic diatoms are shown in Table 1. The soluble EPS fraction from all three 
species showed a heterogeneous distribution of monosaccharides with galactose, 
glucose, mannose/xylose and glucuronic acid being the most abundant sugars, each 
of which contributed >10%  to the carbohydrate composition. In contrast, bound 
EPS and internal sugar fractions were composed almost exclusively of glucose which 
represented 75-96% of the carbohydrate. Also, the residual sugars were dominated 
by glucose or by xylose/mannose but this material showed a considerable variation 
among different species. Considering that the extracted fractions may represent 
mixtures of glycoconjugates it is difficult to judge if the material present in the 
extractants provide structurally unique exopolymers. In order to solve this problem, 
a set of 15 lectins was applied to the cultures of the 3 diatom species and the inten­
sity of labeling and the localization of the labels were qualitatively evaluated 
(Table 2). The responses of the various lectins differed greatly among the extra­
cellular matrices of the three species of diatoms. In addition, the localization of the

labels was distinctively different (Table 2, Figure 1). These results strongly suggest 
that the extracellular material secreted by these benthic diatoms contained highly 
specific glyconjugates. This agrees with earlier work that showed that different types 
of EPS may have a specific localization within the extracellular matrix of diatoms 
(Lind et al.  1997; Wustman et al.  1998).
Function and mechanism of EPS-secretion
Diatoms secrete substantial amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon as extracellu­
lar carbohydrates. Estimates reported for epipelic diatoms range between 30-73% of 
the fixed C 0 2  being secreted as EPS (Goto et al.  1999; Middelburg et al.  2000; 
Smith & Underwood 2000; de Brouwer et al  2000; Wolfstein et al.  2003). In epipelic 
diatoms EPS is secreted from a long narrow slit (raphe) in the silica frustule. Edgar & 
Picket-Heaps (1984) suggested that the role of EPS in gliding movement was to attach 
the diatom to a substratum. They conceived that the EPS strands were displaced paral­
lel to the raphe as a result of contractions of microfilaments of the cytoskeleton, which 
would provide the force for gliding. Subsequently, Webster et al.  (1985) identified this

EPS as actin- and tubuline-based microfilaments that were involved in gliding 
motility o f the diatom Amphora coffeaeformis.  This role o f EPS was experimen­
tally confirmed by Lind et al.  (1997) who used antibodies to inhibit substratum 
adhesion and gliding of the diatom Stauroneis decipiens.  Some researchers have 
observed that diatoms in intertidal mudflats migrate in response to light and to the 
tide (Paterson 1986; Pinkney & Zingmark 1991; Serôdio et al.  1997; Smith & 
Underwood 1998; Underwood & Smith 1998a), although others did not observe 
such migration so that it does not seem to be a general mechanism. Since diatoms 
also migrate in dark, EPS secreted for motility must occur independent of light. 
That this is indeed the case has been demonstrated in cultures (Smith & Under­
wood, 2000; de Brouwer & Stal 2003) as well as under natural conditions in inter­
tidal mudflats (Smith & Underwood 1998).
Hitherto, the amount of EPS required for gliding has not been quantified but Edgar 
& Pickett-Heaps (1984) conceived that motility probably requires only small quanti­
ties of EPS, and hence, would represent a low metabolic expense. Since benthic dia­
toms secrete large amounts of EPS it is attractive to suppose that the production of 
this material serves other purposes. Because it was found that EPS production was 
light dependent and coupled to photosynthesis (de Winder et al.  1999; Staats et al.  
2000a) it was conceived that it was the result of unbalanced growth caused by the 
depletion of an essential nutrient. This view is supported by the results from culture 
experiments (Lewin 1955; Myklestad & Haug 1972; Bhosle et al.  1995; Staats et al.  
2000b) that demonstrated that nutrient depletion (particularly nitrogen and phospho­
rous) enhanced exopolymer production. Mass balance calculations agreed also with 
the occurrence of unbalanced growth due to nutrient shortage (Ruddy et al.  1998a). 
By coupling nitrogen limitation to carbohydrate production, the model of Ruddy et 
al. (1998b) accurately described short-term microphytobenthos and exopolymer 
dynamics in intertidal mudflat sediments.
Currently, hardly any information is available explaining the mechanisms by 
which EPS is secreted and describing the possible pathways of its production. By 
using radioactive labeled 1 4 C 0 2, it was shown that the transfer of photosyntheti- 
cally fixed carbon into the extracellular pools occurred within 30 min. This was 
shown both for a culture of C. closterium  as well as in a field sample of microphy­
tobenthos (Wolfstein et al.  2002). This suggests a close coupling between photo­
synthesis and EPS secretion as was already emphasized by de Winder et al.  (1999) 
and Staats et al.  (2000a). However, this was not confirmed by Underwood et al.  
(2004), who reported for the same species that the flow of photosynthetically fixed 
carbon to EPS occurred with a delay of 3-4 h, suggesting an uncoupling of photo­
synthesis and EPS-production. By using inhibitors that block glucan synthesis, 
glucan catabolism and protein synthesis, Underwood et al.  (2004) suggested at 
least two pathways for EPS production. One pathway was dependent on the syn­
thesis and subsequent catabolism of intracellular glucan, while the other pathway 
was independent of glucan catabolism. This is strong evidence that diatoms may 
excrete different types of EPS as the product of different metabolic pathways and 
that therefore follow different dynamics and differ in composition (see previous 
section).
54 A review of recent insights and views
Other parameters may also affect the production of EPS. Cooksey (1981) for 
instance demonstrated attachment of diatoms to a surface was inhibited in the absence 
of Ca2+.  This was accompanied by a large decrease in EPS-secretion (K.E. Cooksey, 
personal communication). Moreover, it was observed that adjustment of the salinity 
of the medium had an effect on growth and EPS release in diatom cultures (Tokuda 
1969; Allan et cd.  1972) and also changed the composition of the EPS (Allan et cd.  
1972). Furthermore, effects of light levels and temperature may alter the production 
of extracellular material. Staats et al.  (2000a) observed that short-term production of 
EPS occurred above a photon irradiance of 15 pmol n r2 s"' and they suggested that a 
certain minimum amount of light was required to allow accumulation of exopolysac­
charides. However, radioactive 1 4 C-labelling experiments over a broad range of pho­
ton irradiances (7-1200 pmol m"2 s"') resulted in only labeled EPS, and Wolfstein et 
al. (2002) concluded that this light threshold for EPS-production must have been 
below 7 pmol n r2 s"'.  Temperature is another factor that affects EPS production. Wolf­
stein and Stal (2002) found that the rates of carbon fixation and EPS excretion were 
maximal at 25 °C. This value agrees with the optimum temperature for photosynthe­
sis in microphytobenthos (Blanchard et al.  1996). Light and temperature affected the 
patterns and quantities of the different EPS-fractions (i.e. colloidal and attached EPS) 
in different ways, which once again suggest that these fractions are produced and 
secreted by different pathways (De Brouwer and Stal 2002).
The roles of EPS in intertidal coastal areas
Sediment stabilization
EPS produced by benthic assemblages in intertidal mudflats plays an important role in 
stabilization of surface sediments. Several studies have shown the relation between 
the presence of diatom biofilms and a decrease in sediment erosion (De Brouwer et al.  
2000; Paterson 1989; Sutherland et al.  1998; Underwood and Paterson 1993). It is, 
however, not easy to experimentally verify the specific role of EPS in the mediation 
of biogenic sediment stabilization, and experiments often lead to contradictory results. 
For example, Underwood and Paterson (1993) found that colloidal carbohydrate was 
the best biochemical predictor of sediment stability, but other studies indicated that no 
such relation existed (De Brouwer et cd.  2000; Defew et cd.  2002; Paterson et cd.  
2000). (Yallop et al.  2000) found that sediment stability correlated with several vari­
ables including chlorophyll a, extracellular carbohydrate and EPS fractions, water 
content and bacterial biomass. By using multiple regression analysis these authors 
calculated that sediment stability was best predicted by using a combination of chlo­
rophyll a, colloidal EPS and water content. This indicates that multiple processes and 
their interactions are involved in the process of biogenic stabilization in intertidal 
sediments. Biogenic stabilization is the result of the secretion of EPS that leads to the 
formation of a cohesive organic matrix in which diatoms and sediment particles are 
embedded (Taylor and Paterson 1998). Besides the physical effect of EPS as a ‘glue' 
by which sediment particles stick together, a decrease in bottom roughness resulting
J.F.C. de Brouwer, T.R. Neu &  L.J. Stal 55
from the formation of the biofilm probably has an additional effect on sediment stabi­
lization (Paterson and Black 1999).
An approach that directly assesses the role of EPS in sediment stabilization is to 
add it to sediment and subsequently measure changes in sediment behavior. Several 
studies have demonstrated that bacterial EPS modified sediment characteristics (Dade 
et al.  1990; Tolhurst et al.  2002). De Brouwer et al.  (2002a) and Perkins et al.  (2004) 
used EPS that was previously extracted from intertidal sediments and subsequently 
added to sediments in known amounts. De Brouwer et al.  (2005) used EPS from pure 
cultures of various benthic diatoms and added it to muddy sediments. Surprisingly, 
EPS derived from benthic diatoms or from natural diatom biofilms did not affect 
sediment characteristics in the way it was shown for bacterial EPS. Diatom-derived 
EPS partly adsorbed to sediment particles but did not change the sediment properties 
(De Brouwer et al.  2002a). Calcium-ions enhanced the adsorption of EPS, which 
suggests that cation-bridging is an important mechanism to bind EPS to sediment 
particles. Furthermore, it was shown that uronic acids play a role in sediment-EPS 
interactions (Dade et al.  1990; De Brouwer et al.  2005), which further emphasizes 
the importance of cation bridging in adsorption of EPS to the sediment. Perkins et al.  
(2004) found that the addition of EPS affected sediment properties when it was sub­
jected to desiccation, its overall effect being an increase in the threshold of sediment 
erosion, probably because of increased electrostatic binding between sediment parti­
cles (Chenu 1993). The addition of EPS resulted in an increased retention of water 
while erosion thresholds were comparable to controls. The interpretation of these 
results was difficult because it was observed that the presence of salts alone (natu­
rally present in the EPS extracts) also led to increased sediment stability.
Although it was not possible to show convincingly that EPS alone is able to stabi­
lize mud, this does not necessarily exclude its role in sediment morphogenesis. It 
should be taken into account that EPS in the biofilms forms structured entities (Decho 
1994) and it is likely that this structure is lost upon extraction (De Brouwer et al.  
2002a; Underwood and Paterson 2003). Visualization of diatom EPS using carbohy­
drate-specific lectins (Figure 1) showed that exopolymers are present as ordered 
structures. For the diatom C. closterium  only cell surface glycoconjugates were visi­
ble, while for the other two benthic diatom species the set of lectins also visualized 
matrix-structures. The morphological characteristics of the matrix glycoconjugates 
varied between species. N. mutica  formed a honeycomb type of structure where the 
algae where associated mainly with EPS that was located closely to the organisms. In 
contrast, N. cf. brevissima  formed an extensive matrix existing of channels as well as 
amorphous structures. Because the composition and structure of EPS varies among 
diatoms, it is likely that biogenic sediment stabilization is also species dependent. 
Culture experiments have confirmed this (De Brouwer et cd.  2005; Holland et cd.  
1974). Furthermore, the relations between extracellular carbohydrate fractions and 
critical shear stress for axenic cultures of the diatoms Cylindrotheca closterium  and 
Nitzschia  cf. brevissima  showed that, although these species secreted similar amounts 
of EPS, the effect on the rheological properties (i.e. critical shear stress) of the sedi­
ments were notably different. Hence, it was concluded that the addition of isolated 
EPS from these diatoms did not affect sediment stability. It was conceived that in
56 A review of recent insights and views
addition to the quantity and chemical composition of the EPS, the assembly of 
exopolymers in ordered three dimensional matrix structures is essential to increase 
the erosion threshold of muddy sediments.
Currently, it is unknown which fraction of EPS is actually responsible for sedi­
ment stabilization. It has been suggested that EPS related to motility is important for 
the stabilization of intertidal sediment (Paterson 1989). On the one hand, extracellu­
lar polymers that putatively serve for motility and adhesion to a substratum are highly 
cohesive (Higgins et al.  2002), and this suggests that it could glue sediment particles. 
On the other hand, it is known that motility trails of cultured diatoms usually detach 
shortly after secretion and are not likely to form such extended structures as those 
depicted in Figure 1. This view was confirmed by Wigglesworth-Cooksey and Cook­
sey (2004) who noted that the footpath and motility extracellular glycoconjugates 
produced by Amphora coffeaeformis  and a Navicula  sp. appeared to have an effect 
only over short distance in order to establish a physical contact between the diatom 
and a substratum (Wetherbee et al.  1998). However, in addition polymers with a dif­
ferent composition were secreted forming an extensive matrix. This EPS was more 
likely to mediate sediment stabilization because it exerted its effect over much greater 
distances and was potentially able to embed sediments into the EPS-matrix. By using 
a model sediment system, Wigglesworth-Cooksey and Cooksey (2004) also observed 
that sediment stability (measured as hydraulic conductivity) induced by A. coffeae­
formis  was closely correlated with the accumulation extracellular matrix material that 
was not soluble in 0.5 M N aH C 03  at 90 °C (Wigglesworth-Cooksey et al.  2001). 
This polymer was mainly produced under P 0 4 3-limiting conditions, suggesting that 
nutrient limitation could play a role in secretion of matrix EPS and thus sediment 
stabilization. Similarly, the erosion rate of a sediment inoculated with a culture of the 
diatom Nitzschia curvilineata  was highly correlated with the bulk carbohydrate to 
chlorophyll a ratio, which was considered as an indicator of the physiological state 
of the diatoms (Sutherland et al.  1998). Also in this study stationary phase conditions 
appeared to trigger production of bulk EPS as well as the decrease in erosion rate.
EPS as a food source
Exopolymers are a potential food source for other organisms inhabiting intertidal 
environments. In general, utilization of organic carbon by bacteria occurs rapidly. 
When extracellular fractions originating from a community of benthic diatoms were 
added to sediment slurries, it was found that 50%  was utilized within 24 h (Goto et 
cd. 2001). For extracellular polymers isolated from the pelagic diatom Thalassiosira  
a decrease of 50%  in EPS concentration was obtained after 11-25 days of incubation 
(Aluwihare and Répéta 1999; Giroldo et cd.  2003). The difference in this utilization 
rate between the pelagic and benthic systems is perhaps the results of a much higher 
density of bacteria in the sediment. The degradability of extracellular organic matter 
is dependent on its composition and structure. Nevertheless, Goto et al  (2001) found 
little variation in the decomposition of various extracellular carbohydrate fractions 
that were isolated from different diatom species as well as a natural microphytob­
enthos assemblage. This indicates that compositional variations in the extracellular
J.F.C. de Brouwer, T.R. Neu &  L.J. Stal 57
material were not limiting the initial degradation of the extracellular carbon pool, 
suggesting that a wide variety of carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes may be present 
in sediments to enable a rapid degradation of bioavailable glycoconjugates.
Also in situ  studies in intertidal mudflats indicate that transfer of algal derived 
extracellular material occurs rapidly. Middelburg et al.  (2000) showed that the 
transfer of photosynthetically fixed carbon into bacterial phospholipid fatty acids 
occurred within 4 h. Although these authors did not specifically investigate the role 
of EPS they concluded that transfer of organic carbon to bacteria occurred via 
extracellular material, which was estimated to represent 40 % of photosynthetically 
fixed carbon. This confirms the observation that a short-term coupling exists 
between bacterial production and extracellular compounds released by diatoms in 
phototrophic biofilms (Van Duyl et al.  1999). Water-extractable carbohydrates 
appeared to play an important role in bacterial dynamics. Its rapid utilization by 
diatoms suggests that this water-extractable carbohydrate represents a highly labile 
pool of carbon. Indeed it was found that the EPS produced in the surface layer of 
the sediment during tidal emersion consisted of polymers that consisted predomi­
nantly of glucose (De Brouwer and Stal 2001; Taylor et al.  1999). Glucose is pref­
erentially degraded by bacteria (Giroldo et al.  2003; King 1986) indicating that this 
photosynthetically produced EPS fraction is important for transfer of carbon within 
the microbial foodweb.
Utilization of EPS is not necessarily restricted to bacteria. Heterotrophy has been 
observed among diatoms and some observations indicate that diatoms decompose 
their own EPS, utilizing it as an energy storage when deprived of light (Smith and 
Underwood 2000; Staats et al.  2000). Furthermore, meio- and macrofauna may also 
utilize EPS, however not much information on this subject is available. Current 
knowledge (Decho and Uopez 1993; Hoskins etal.  2003) suggest that certain animals 
were able to efficiently utilize algal as well as bacterial EPS. However, it should be 
emphasized that EPS is a poor food source with respect to its nutritional value. It is 
rather a valuable energy source in combination with other, more nutritional, com­
pounds. Further research is necessary to identify the different consumers that utilize 
this labile carbon source in intertidal environments.
