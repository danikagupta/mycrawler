Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most common emergencies in 
neurocritical care. In Germany, the incidence of SE is about 17/100 
000 per year, increasing with age [1]. Especially generalized con -
vulsive (tonic-clonic) status epilepticus (GCSE) is still associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality [2].
SE is defined as a single prolonged seizure or a series of two or 
more consecutive seizures without return to neurological baseline 
between seizures. According to the most recent definition, a gen -
eralized convulsive status epilepticus is already diagnosed after a minimum seizure duration of five minutes, because the likelihood 
of spontaneous termination decreases after this time period; con -
sequently, treatment should be initiated without further delay [3]. With significantly less experimental data on focal SE and absence 
SE available, the reported minimum seizure duration for the two 
conditions is 10 min and 10–15 min, respectively, reflecting the as -
sumption that neuronal damage is to be expected at a later point in time or to a lesser degree with focal SE and absence SE compared to GCSE [3]. However, already after 5 min the likelihood that a 
 seizure will terminate spontaneously is low, regardless of the type 
of SE [4].
Three clinical stages with different treatment regimens are dif -
ferentiated: 1. The initial phase: seizure duration  ≤ 10 min in a pre -
viously untreated patient; treatment with benzodiazepines (loraz -
epam, midazolam, clonazepam). 2. Established SE: SE persisting 
for 10-30 (max. 60) min. Besides benzodiazepines, non-sedating 
IV anticonvulsants (phenytoin, valproic acid, levetiracetam) can be 
used. 3. Refractory SE: The status epilepticus has already contin -
ued for 60 min, despite appropriately dosed anticonvulsant treat-
ment. Refractory GCSE is an acute life-threatening situation, re -
quiring fast initiation of intensive-care monitoring with prepared-ness for endotracheal intubation and treatment escalation to IV anesthetic administration. 4. If SE continues after 24 h of treatment 
with anesthetic agents, it is termed super-refractory SE. With no The Treatment and Prognosis of Refractory and Super-Refractory

Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is defined as status epilep -
ticus (SE) persisting over 60 min and resistant to treatment with 
benzodiazepines and non-sedating antiepileptic drugs. The 
term super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) refers to a re -
fractory episode continuing under general anesthesia for more 
than 24 h. RSE is treated with a combination of non-sedating 
AED and i. v. anesthetics; first choice drugs are midazolam, 
propofol and thiopental. The management of super-refractory 
status epilepticus (SRSE) is challenging as clear evidence-based 
guidelines are lacking. Recommendations are mainly based on 
case reports and small case series. Therapeutic options include 
ketamine, inhalational anesthetics, steroids and immunoglob -
ulins. Ketogenic diet, electroconvulsive therapy and epilepsy surgery are also considered as potentially effective. A promising 
new approach is the neurosteroid allopregnanolone. Mortality 
of RSE and SRSE is largely influenced by the etiology and is 
markedly higher as compared to non-refractory status epilep
-
ticus. It was reported to be about 30 % and 50 %, respectively.

Gollwitzer S, Hamer HM. The Treatment and Prognosis … Neurology International Open 2017; 1: E204–E210systematic data on treatment available, recommendations are 
largely based on case reports [5].
Especially refractory and super-refractory SE are associated with 
significantly increased morbidity and mortality and continue to be 
very challenging conditions to treat. Therefore, the aim of this re -
view was to provide an overview of the current treatment options and their prognoses.
The Refractory Status Epilepticus (RSE)
Incidence
RSE incidence rates are mostly estimated, using data from retro -
spective studies. They are reported to be 31 % to 43 % of all patients 
with SE treated in intensive care units [6–8]. A recent prospective 
analysis found that 33 % of SE cases were refractory in nature [2]. It 
is assumed that RSE more commonly develops in patients with acute brain damage than in patients with pre-existing epilepsy 
[7, 9]. However, RSE may also occur in previously healthy adults as 
the first manifestation of epilepsy (‘de novo’ status epilepticus)  [10].
Management
The aggressiveness of treatment is chosen according to the type 
of SE.
In patients with GCSE, it is vital to urgently terminate the sei -
zure state, as otherwise there is a risk of neuronal death due to mas -
sive glutamatergic receptor activity with increased calcium influx into cells, ultimately leading to life-threatening apoptosis and ne -
crosis [11–12].
Patients experiencing refractory generalized convulsive status 
epilepticus require treatment in an intensive care unit, ideally in a neurocritical care unit with EEG monitoring facilities. In cases where 
the cause of SE can be identified, this should be addressed and ap -
propriate treatment provided.
Since at this point in time, benzodiazepines and non-sedating 
anticonvulsants have already been used unsuccessfully, additional fast administration of IV anesthetics is the basic principle in the 
treatment RSE with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In the major-
ity of cases, this approach is successful and terminates SE, but up 
to 10 % of patients experience renewed seizures during the course 
of this treatment or with dose reduction of the anesthetic agents 
[11]. First-line treatment options include midazolam, propofol and 
thiopental. With no comparative studies available, no evi -
dence-based superiority of any of the available drugs can be pos -
tulated; therefore, the choice of treatment should be made on an 
individual basis and take into account the respective drug interac-
tion and adverse drug reaction profiles [13–16].
The use of thiopental for the treatment of SE is backed by many 
years of experience; this agent has a strong anticonvulsant effect 
[17]. However, patients may experience significant hypotension 
under this treatment, frequently requiring additional vasopressor 
administration. Other factors to be taken into consideration include 
the comparatively longer half-life of thiopental—increasing the risk 
of accumulation and frequently prolonging mechanical ventilation 
times—, its drug interaction potential, immunosuppression, and 
potential hepatic and pancreatic toxicity [18]. Treatment is typical -
ly started with the administration of an initial bolus of 5 mg/kg body weight; the maintenance dose is 3–7 mg/kg BW/h for 24 h under 
EEG monitoring. The therapeutic end point may for instance be burst-suppression pattern in the EEG for 24 h. Unfortunately, no 
conclusive data is available regarding the optimum duration of the burst-suppression pattern before the sedation can be reduced.
Propofol has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including 
its very rapid onset of action and the fast recovery even after pro -
longed administration. Thus, major drug-drug interactions are un -
likely. Patients treated with propofol may experience a relevant drop in blood pressure, too. After administration over several days, 
the risk of propofol-infusion syndrome should be taken into con -
sideration, a rare but in the majority of cases fatal complication [19]. Lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and cardiac 
dysfunction are usually present. Propofol is also administered, 
using EEG guidance, to achieve a burst-suppression pattern; treat-
ment is started with an initial bolus of 2 mg/kg body weight and 
maintained with approx. 4–10 mg/kg BW/h [20].
As a short-acting benzodiazepine with a strong anticonvulsant 
effect, midazolam is also suitable for continuous administration. However, in contrast to the other anesthetic agents, midazolam 
does not normally achieve a burst-suppression pattern in the EEG, 
even if administered in high doses. Midazolam may have a cardio -
depressive effect. In addition, patients may rapidly develop toler-
ance to midazolam which in turn promotes seizure recurrence [21]. 
It is recommended to start treatment with an initial bolus of 
0.2 mg/kg body weight and maintain it with the continuous admin -
istration of 0.1–0.5 mg/kg BW/h.
When deciding upon the treatment of refractory nonconvulsive 
SE, it is also necessary to balance potential negative treatment ef -
fects against the inherent morbidity and mortality of this condi -
tion. Nonconvulsive SE (NCSE) is used as an umbrella term incor-porating various entities, including NCSE with or without coma, 
absence SE, aura SE, aphasic SE, or autonomous SE [3]. Establish -
ing the type of status epilepticus on an individual basis is a critical prerequisite for the choice of the therapeutic approach, even 
though controversy remains—and this applies to all types of NCSE—
with respect to whether, and to what extent, clinically relevant neu -
ronal injury occurs and whether urgent and aggressive termination of SE, accepting treatment-associated risks, should be the primary 
goal. In fact, it appears that the functional outcome significantly depends on etiological factors and the type of seizure activity; thus, 
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s situation 
[22, 23]. Several recent retrospective studies found that, especial -
ly in patients with milder types of SE, aggressive treatment with anesthetic agents may be associated with higher mortality, higher 
complication rates, and longer hospital stays [24–26]. The most 
important point of criticism regarding these retrospective cohorts 
is that inherent differences between the groups may still have been 
present despite the authors’ significant efforts to adjust for con -
founders. It is challenging to exclude with certainty that more se -
verely affected patients received anesthetic agents more frequent-
ly or in different doses by the treating physicians than less severe 
cases [16]. This underscores the urgent need for randomized and 
prospective studies on the management of status epilepticus to 
prevent that disputable results are uncritical integrated in clinical 
treatment pathways.

Gollwitzer S, Hamer HM. The Treatment and Prognosis … Neurology International Open 2017; 1: E204–E210ReviewContinuous EEG monitoring can aid diagnosis of refractory sta -
tus epilepticus and greatly assist in monitoring treatment response 
(▶Fig. 1 ). It can be assumed that nonconvulsive SE in patients with 
impaired consciousness, particularly in those with underlying cen -
tral nervous system disease, continues to be underdiagnosed and 
that the actual incidence is higher than reported so far [27, 28]. In 
case continuous EEG monitoring is not feasible, frequent EEG  recordings are indispensable to guide treatment.
The Super-refractory Status Epilepticus 
(SRSE)
Incidence
Introduced during the London-Innsbruck Colloquium on status 
 epilepticus in 2011, the term “super-refractory status epilepticus” 
refers to SE of more than 24 h duration despite appropriately dosed 
treatment with anesthetic agents [5]. According to more recent prospective studies, the incidence of SRSE is approximately 4 % to 
9 % of SE cases [2, 9]. SRSE cases were more frequently observed in 
younger patients with severely impaired consciousness at initial presentation [2]. Autoimmune inflammatory conditions are report-
ed to be the most common cause of SRSE [29–30].
Management
The recommendations for the treatment of SRSE are primarily based on case reports; data from randomized trials are missing. If 
the underlying condition, such as autoimmune or infectious en -
cephalitis or intoxication, can be identified, treating this condition has a strong anticonvulsant effect in patients with SRSE [31]. As 
with the treatment of RSE, the use of IV anesthetic agents is the 
foundation of symptomatic treatment in SRSE patients.
In patients who do not respond to the medications mentioned 
above, an attempt with ketamine in combination with benzodiaz -
epines can be made. In contrast to other anesthetic agents, keta -
mine does not bind to the GABA-A receptors, but acts as an antag -
onist on NMDA receptors. Since in the course of SE, GABA recep -
tors are internalized and NMDA receptors upregulated, increased 
efficacy of ketamine can be assumed [32, 33]. Another advantage 
of this medication is that it does not adversely affect cardiac func-tion, helping to reduce the need for additional vasopressors. A ret-
rospective multicenter study analyzing 58 cases reported termina -▶Fig. 1  EEG of a 34-year-old patient with suspected antibody-negative autoimmune encephalitis and nonconvulsive SRSE of 6 days’ duration,

Gollwitzer S, Hamer HM. The Treatment and Prognosis … Neurology International Open 2017; 1: E204–E210tion of SE along with additional ketamine administration in 32 % of 
cases [34].
Single-case reports indicate that inhalation anesthetic agents 
may be effective as well. In a case series, desflurane and isoflurane 
terminated SE in 4 of 7 cases; however, under this treatment com -
plications, including one mesenteric artery infarction, one deep venous thrombosis, and one hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy, 
occurred [35]. Overall, the use of inhalation anesthetic agents 
seems to be limited by the high treatment costs and the high com -
plication rates.
As in all other phases of SE, anticonvulsants are used to treat 
SRSE as well. Especially during anesthesia and after discontinuation of anesthetics, effective adjunctive therapy with anticonvulsants 
is critical. Systematic data indicating which drugs or drug combi -
nations should be preferentially used are not available. Suitable medications include anticonvulsants which can initially be admin -
istered intravenously or via nasogastric tube or percutaneous en -
doscopic gastrostomy, ensuring that therapeutic blood levels are rapidly attained. Levetiracetam, lacosamide, carbamazepine, per-
ampanel, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, and valproate are 
widely used. However, only phenobarbital, phenytoin and valproate 
are approved for the treatment of SE, while the remaining anticon -
vulsants are not explicitly approved for this indication. It is impor-tant to ensure adequate dosing and fast uptitration. Combinations 
of more than 3 non-sedating anticonvulsants should be avoided. 
In case a drug shows no effect, it can usually be discontinued and 
replaced by another agent, even in the acute phase. In addition, 
continuous magnesium infusion can be attempted.
Steroids have been used in the treatment of SE for a number of 
years. There are two reasons supporting the use of steroids to treat 
SRSE: First, autoimmune encephalitis is presumably the most com -
mon cause of SRSE, even if patients do not test positive for anti -
bodies. In this case, immunomodulatory therapy would be a caus -
ative treatment. Second, inflammatory processes such as the acti -
vation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e. g. interleukin-1β and 
TNF-α, are likely to play an important role in epileptogenesis/icto -
genesis; consequently, anti-inflammatory therapy may have a sig -
nificant anti-seizure potential [36]. Besides steroids, the adminis -
tration of immunoglobulins and the use of plasmapheresis could be considered, although the currently available data are not suffi-
cient to support a general recommendation in this respect [37].
Apart from pharmacological treatment strategies, ketogenic 
diet (KD) has been reported to be an effective treatment for SRSE 
in various case studies, especially in pediatric patients, but less fre -
quently in adult patients too [38, 39]. An almost carbohydrate-free 
diet has been used to treat epilepsy since the 1920s. One of the 
largest sample of adult SRSE patients treated with KD comprised 
10 patients; 9 of these patients experienced termination of SRSE 
under KD. The median time from initiation of KD to termination of 
SRSE was 3 days. In 2 cases, SE was only terminated after 12 and 31 
days, respectively; whether there was a causal relationship remains 
unproven in these cases. In all patients, ketosis was achieved with -
out problems and KD was not associated with any significant com -
plications [39]. In an ICU, KD can easily be initiated intravenously and continued enterally, if needed [40]. Commercial products typ -
ically contain fat and carbohydrates/proteins in a ratio of 4:1 or 3:1. Achievement and maintenance of ketosis is verified by measuring the levels of ketone bodies in serum and/or urine. Contraindica -
tions for KD include various metabolic defects, such as pyruvate 
decarboxylase deficiency, fatty acid oxidation disorders and gluco -
neogenesis disorders. Concomitant administration of topiramate or zonisamide with KD increases the risk of metabolic acidosis. Val -
proate inhibits hepatic beta-oxidation, potentially making it more difficult to achieve ketosis.
Another non-pharmacological intervention to treat SRSE is ther-
apeutic hypothermia [41]. Hypothermia reduces cerebral oxygen 
and ATP consumption, inhibits glutamate release and lowers oxi -
dative stress. In addition, hypothermia exerts an anti-edematous effect, resulting from the reduced permeability of the blood brain 
barrier, and an anti-inflammatory effect. Because of these mecha -
nisms, hypothermia is thought to have both an anticonvulsant and a neuroprotective effect [42, 43]. Recently, the randomized, mul -
ticenter HYBERNATUS study systematically evaluated the effect of hypothermia for the treatment of SE on the outcome after 90 days. 
Altogether, 270 patients were included in the study. However, treatment with hypothermia was not associated with a more fa -
vorable outcome compared with standard treatment. Moreover, more complications occurred in the hypothermia group compared 
with the control group [41].
Emergency epilepsy surgery may be considered in selected 
cases if neuroimaging studies clearly identify a distinct lesion as 
the cause of SRSE or if a focal, circumscribed epileptogenic zone 
can be defined electroclinically (▶ Fig. 2 ). Focal resection to treat 
patients with, for instance, focal cortical dysplasia or tumor seems to be a sensible approach. In patients with Rasmussen’s encepha -
litis, hemispherectomy is often the last treatment option to termi -
nate epilepsia partialis continua. For palliative intervention, corpus 
callosotomy may be considered in individual cases [44]. It remains 
unclear at what point in time over the course of SRSE a surgical in -
tervention should be performed.
In individual cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was success -
fully used to treat SRSE [45, 46]. Here it may be necessary to reduce 
the doses of the anticonvulsants and anesthetics the patient is re -
ceiving to facilitate seizure induction by ECT. Approximately 5-8 
ECT treatment sessions on consecutive days are recommended.
Recently, the neurosteroid allopregnanolone was presented as 
another promising treatment option for SRSE [47]. Over the course 
of SRSE, the effect of GABAergic substances progressively weakens 
due to the internalization of synaptic GABA-A receptors. In an ani -
mal model, allopregnanolone modulated GABA-A receptors and reduced their internalization [48]. So far, clinical experience with 
the use of allopregnanolone in humans is limited. In two pediatric 
patients, treatment with allopregnanolone in combination with 
GABAergic drugs successfully terminated SE [47]. Currently, a ran -
domized, multicenter, double-blind study on the treatment of SE with allopregnanolone is being performed [49].
The Prognosis and Mortality of Refractory 
and Super-refractory SE
The mortality rates of RSE and SRSE range from 15 % to 54 % and 
thus exceed the mortality of non-refractory SE (11–37 %) by far. In 
the most recent study, 24.5 % of patients with RSE, 37.9 % of pa -
E207
Gollwitzer S, Hamer HM. The Treatment and Prognosis … Neurology International Open 2017; 1: E204–E210Reviewtients with SRSE, but only 9.8 % of patients with non-refractory SE 
died [2]. The high variability of the reported mortality rates is ex-
plained by the significant heterogeneity of the patient populations 
studied. Clinical scores are used to assess functional outcome and 
mortality in patients with SE. For instance, the Status epilepticus 
Outcome Score (STESS) is a valid and easy-to-use scoring system 
to predict mortality. Factors included in SE-related scores are con -
sciousness, type of seizure, age, and the presence of epilepsy. Using these four variables, the mortality risk can be predicted with high 
sensitivity and relatively good specificity [52]. In addition, the ep -
idemiology-based mortality score in status epilepticus (EMSE) is available as another scoring system, taking into account the etiol -
ogy of SE, patients’ age, comorbidities, and EEG findings [53].
The underlying etiology of SE certainly as a significant impact 
on functional outcome [50, 51]. Especially patients developing (S)
RSE after hypoxic brain injury have per se a poor prognoses. Since 
hypoxic encephalopathies with generalized periodic discharges in 
the EEG tend to be highly refractory to treatment and have a very poor prognosis, many working groups consider them as entities of 
their own, not meeting the strict definition of SE [54, 55]. By con -
trast, factors such as younger age, known epilepsy and initially (at least partially) maintained consciousness are indicative of a better 
outcome [50, 56]. Increasing duration of status epilepticus indi -
cates a poorer prognosis; however, even after prolonged therapeu-tic coma and status epilepticus persisting over several weeks, there 
is a chance of achieving a good functional outcome, as long as com -
plications can be avoided [57–59]. Thus, therapeutic nihilism is not indicated.Conclusion
Refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus represent neu-
rological emergencies, requiring treatment under intensive EEG 
monitoring in a neurocritical care unit. Beyond the administration 
of non-sedating anticonvulsants, refractory status epilepticus is 
treated with intravenous (IV) anesthetics. Here, preferred drugs in -
clude midazolam, propofol and thiopental. With only limited data from studies available, established clinical pathways for patients 
with super-refractory status epilepticus are non-existent. Treat-
ment options include ketamine, inhalation anesthetics, immuno -
modulation, ketogenic diet, hypothermia, electroconvulsive ther-apy, and, in selected cases, epilepsy surgery.
Refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus are associat -
ed with significant morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, complete 
recovery without residual neurological deficits has been observed 
even after prolonged episodes of status epilepticus.
