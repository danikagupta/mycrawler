A new gene organization  related to  carbohydrate  metabolism  of Citrobacter  species has  been identified 
on a bout  4.1 kb chromosomal DNA fragment. Sequence analysis revealed  four ope n reading frames  
(ORFs) , and gene orders were determined to be PTS system mannitol -specific transporter subunit 
EIICBA (MtlA), L-sorbose -1-phosphate reductase (SorE),  class II fructose -1,6-biphosphatase (GlpX), and 
mannitol repressor (MtlR) . The deduced am ino acid sequence s of these ORFs  showed more than  80% 
identities to MtlA , SorE , GlpX , and  MtlR  of Escherichia  coli, Shigella,  and Salmonella enterica , 
respectively. The sorE  gene was heterologously expressed in E. coli. The recombinant SorE clearly 
showed the L-sorbose -1-phosphate reductase  activity.

INTRODUCTION  
 
It is well known that carbohydrate  uptake  in bacteria is 
mediated via  the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):  
carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS)  which 
involves both the transport and phosphorylation of a large 
number of carbohydrates  (Postma et al., 1993) . These 
PTS-carbohydrates include glucose, fructose, mannose, 
sorbose , mannitol, glucitol and galactitol. This system is 
composed of three catalytic proteins, enzyme I (EI), 
enzyme II (EII) and histidine -containing protein (HPr) 
(Barabote and Saier, 2005) . EI and HPr are cytoplasmic 
proteins that participate in the phosphor ylation of all PTS 
carbohydrates. EII protein  is a single membrane -bound 
protein composed of three distinct domains (EIIA, EII B 
and EIIC) , and promote s the transport of one or a few 
sugars in a given bacterium.  Seven EII families have 
been cla ssified accor ding to their specific sugar 
substrates (Barabote and Saier, 2005) . The structural 
clustered in a pts operon, whereas the   genes  for  the

substrate -specific EIIs are clustered in an operon or 
regulon together with the structural genes for the 
corresponding catabolic  enzymes (Barabote and Saier, 
2005; Postma et al., 1993) . In addition, previous studies 
have d emonstrated that the genes involved in 
carbohydrate catabolism in bacteria are clustered in an 
operon (Postma et al., 1993).    
Citrobacter  is a genus  of Gram -negative bacteria in the 
Enterobacteriaceae family and can be found in soil, 
water, wastewater, an d human intestine. Although the 
genes of carbohydrate  catabolic operons in enteric 
bacteria  are known, no information has been obtained on 
the genes involved in carbohydrate ca tabolism of 
Citrobacter  species . In the previous study, we have 
isolated a gene (ctg 2) showing the significant similarity 
(86% identity) to the sequence of putative oxidoreductase 
of Escherichia coli ,from Citrobacter  sp. MY -5 (Kim et al., 
2005). The nucleotide sequences of ctg 2 gene have 
been deposited in the GenBank database under 
accession number AY859495.  Very recently, we found 
that the sequence of a L -sorbose -1-phosphate reductase 
(SorE) gene from  Enterobacter   cancerogenus   ATCC  Jang et al.         7393

35316 showing very remarkable sequence similarity to 
that of c tg 2 gene described here, with an identity of 92% 
at amino acid level, was deposited in GenBank database 
with accession no. ZP_05970186.  
Based on this finding, the present  study was 
undertaken to investigate  a gene organ ization  related to 
carbohydrate  catabolism of Citrobacter  species  and we 
found a new gene organization . This is the first report on 
molecular genetic analysis of carbohydrate catabolism in 
Citrobacter  species . To investigate whether the protein 
encoded by the ctg 2 gene  (1278 bp) has the enzyme 
activity of SorE,  an 1.3 kb fragment including open 
reading frame (ORF) of ctg 2 was amplified by 
polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using Pyrobest DNA 
polymerase (Takara  Shuzo , Japan) and a combination of 
forward (5’ -TACATATGAAAACGAAAGTGGCTG -3’) and 
reverse (5’ -TACTCGAG TCATATCGCCGCCTCC -3’) 
primers, where the underlines represent the recognition 
sites of NdeI and XhoI, respectively, and translation 
codon ATG and stop codon T GA of ORF are shown in 
italics. The amplified 1.3 kb fragment was digested with 
NdeI and XhoI and then inserted into the corresponding 
sites of pET -29a(+), resulting in expression plasmid pET -
Ctg2  which was finally transformed into E. coli  
BL21(DE3) . E. coli  BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET -Ctg2 
were grown in LB medium containing 50 µg/ml of 
kanamy cin at 37°C with shaking and p rotein expression 
was induced  by the addition of 1 mM  isopropyl -thio-β-D-
galactopyranoside (IPTG) when the culture turbidity at 600 nm reached 0.8. After induction for 3 h, the cells were 
collected by centrifugation at 5000 ×  g at 4 °C for 10 min, 
and then washed with 50 mM  MES buffer (pH 6.2). After 
disrupt ion by sonication , the cell components were 
separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by 
centrifugation at 12 ,000 × g for 20 min, and  then 
analyzed by SDS -PAGE. A predom inant band 
corresponding to the expected size ( 46 kDa) of 
recombinant protein  was also observed in soluble fraction 
of induced cells ( Figure 1A, lane 3) . This molecular 
weight is in close to 45,825 Da calculated from the amino 
acid sequence of  Ctg2 . Enzyme  assay of L-sorbose -1-
phosphate reductase  was done by the method of 
Anderson an d Simkins (1982) , using D -fructose -1-
phosphate as a substrate . As shown in Figure 1B, SorE 
activity was not detectable in E. coli  BL21  (DE3) cells 
harboring pET -29a(+) vector pl asmid, whereas it was 
significantly increased  in cells harboring pET -Ctg2 
plasmid.  This result indicates that ctg2 gene in this study 
encodes SorE gene of Citrobacter  sp. strain KCTC 
18061P .  
It is known that sor operon  (5559 bp)  involved in 
metabolism and  transport of L-sorbose  in E. coli  and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae  contain seven genes clustered 
behind a single promoter  sorC, the gene order being 
sorCDFBAME  (Figure 2B) (Wehmeier et al., 1992; 
Wehmeier and Lengeler, 1994 ). The gene sorD  encodes 
a D-glucitol -6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the genes 
sorFBAM  encode  four  proteins of a phosphoenolpyruvate - 7394         Afr. J. Microbiol. Res.

dependent L-sorbose -phospho -transferase system and 
sorE, finally, an L -sorbose  1-phosphate  reductase 
(Wehmeier and Lengeler, 1994) . On the basis of these 
reports, we tried to  isolate a gene cluster  involved in 
metabolism and transport of L-sorbose in Citrobacter  sp. 
strain KCTC 18061P . The chromosomal DNA of 
Citrobacter  sp. strain KCTC 18061P  was digested with 
several restriction enzymes and analyzed by Southern 
hybridiz ation  using ctg 2  DNA as a probe. The 3.8-kb 
HindIII and 4.2-kb EcoRI/PstI fragment s showing strong 
signal were fractionated from 0.7% agarose gels and 
ligated with the corresponding site of pBluescript II SK (+) , 
and designated p BS4 and pBS5, respectively . After DNA 
sequencing by subcloning of pBS4  and pBS5 , the 
analyses of nucleotide and deduced protein sequences 
by using the BLAST (blastx)  program of the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)  showed that 
this 5.1 kb fragment s contained  four ORFs for the genes  
(Figure 2A). Unexpectedly, further BLAST analysis 
revealed that these ORFs have  a different genetic  
organization from  sor operon involved in metabolism and 
transport of L-sorbose (Figure 2B) (Wehmeier et al., 
1992; Wehmeier and Lengeler, 1994 ). The first gene 
(accession number JX315572 ) had an open reading 
frame of 1380 bp encoding a polypeptide comprised of 459 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence 
showed a high similarity ( more than 84% identi cal 
residues ) with PTS system mannitol -specific transporter 
subunit EIICBA  (MtlA) of E. coli , K. pneumoniae , and 
Salmonella enterica . The second  gene (JX315573 ) had 
an open reading frame of 1278 bp encoding a 
polypeptide comprised of 425 amino acids. The predicted 
amino acid sequence displayed a  remarkable  similarity 
(more than 90% identical residues) with SorE of E. coli , K. 
pneumoniae , and S. enterica . The third gene (JX315574 ) 
had an open reading frame of 969 bp encoding a 
polypeptide comprised of 322 amino acids. The predicted 
amino acid sequ ence exhibited a high similarity (more 
than 82% identical residues) with class II fructose 1,6 -
bisphosphatase (GlpX) of E. coli , Shigella,  and S. 
enterica . The  fourth  genes (JX315575 ) had an open 
reading frame of 510 bp encoding a polypeptide 
comprised of 169 amino acids. The predicted amino acid 
sequence revealed  significant  similarities (more than 85% 
identical residues) with mannitol repressor  (MtlR)  of E. 
coli, K. pneumoniae , and S. enterica . In addition, the 
truncated gene downstream from mtlR gene rev ealed a 
high similarity with putative fructose transport system -
related  kinase ( more than 80% identical residues) of E. 
coli, Shigella  and S. enterica .  Jang et al.         7395

(ZP_02659378), and class II FBPase of  Shigella flexneri  (EGK19770). E. coli  YggF is the experimentally verified 
class II FBPase [3].  
 
 
 
Mannitol catabolism has been intensively studied in 
enteric bacteria (Postma  et al., 1993) . D-mannitol (Mtl)  is 
also taken up and concomitantly phosphorylat ed to 
mannitol -1-phosphate by mannitol -specific PTS. The 
genes involved in mannitol catabolism have been 
identified from Gram -negative bacteria, such as E. coli  
(Figge at  al., 1994 ), Klebsiella  (Otte and Lengeler, 2001) , 
and Vibrio  (Kumar,  2011) . These gen es are also 
clustered in the single operon  (3666 bp)  composed of 
three genes ( mtlADR ), encoding (i) EIIMtl (mtlA), (ii) a 
mannitol -1-phosphate dehydrogenase ( mtlD), and (iii) a 
mannitol repressor ( mtlR) (Figure 2B). EIIMtl encoded by 
mtlA participates  in phosphorylation and transport of 
mannitol as mannitol -1-phosphate, which  is further  
oxidized to fructose 6 -phosphate by mannitol -1-
phosphate dehydrogenase (Kumar et al., 2011) . The 
mannitol repressor MtlR represses the mannitol operon 
transcription through interaction, either directly or 
indirectly, with other DNA -binding protein(s), and it was proposed to be a part of a transcriptional complex that 
regulates  the mannitol operon expression of E. coli , 
Shigella , Vibrio , and other Gram -negative bacteria  (Tan e t 
al., 2009) . In E. coli  genome , the glpFKX  operon (3366 
bp) encodes glycerol transport facilitator, glycerol kinase, 
and class II fructose -1,6-bisphosphatase  (FBPase) , 
respectively  (Figure 2B) . This operon is one of five 
operons of the glp regulon involve d in the growth of E. 
coli on glycerol (Brown et al., 2009; Truniger  et al., 1992) . 
As shown in Fig ure 3, amino acid sequence alignment of 
the experimentally verified GlpX from E. coli  with those  
from Citrobacter  sp. strain KCTC 18061P , S. enteric , and 
Shigella flexneri  showed more than 82% identity  and 
identified 13 conserved residues involved in substrate 
binding or catalysis (Brown et al., 2009) . On the other 
hand, the truncated gene downstream from mtlR gene in 
this study revealed a high similarity with  putative fructose 
transport system -related kinase.  
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the   sorE  gene   7396         Afr. J. Microbiol. Res.  
 
 
 
downstream from mtlA of Citrobacter  sp. strain KCTC  
18061P  encodes L-sorbose -1-phosphate reductase  by 
production of recombinant enzyme and enzyme a ssay. 
We also firstly  found a new gene organization related to 
carbohydrate catabolism of Citrobacter  sp., which is 
different from the catabolic operons composed of the 
experimentally verified genes.
