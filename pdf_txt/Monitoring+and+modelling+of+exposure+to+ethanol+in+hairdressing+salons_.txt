Mijnheer de staatssecretaris,
Graag bied ik u hierbij het advies aan over de beroepsmatige blootstelling aan ethanol 
(‘alcohol’). Het maakt deel uit van een uitg ebreide reeks, waarin  gezondheidskundige 
advieswaarden worden afgeleid voor concentraties van stoffen op de werkplek. Dit advies 
over ethanol is opgesteld door de Commissie WGD van de Gezondheidsraad en beoordeeld 
door de Beraadsgroep Gezondheid en Omgeving. De Commissie Beoordeling Carcinogeni-
teit van Stoffen heeft geadviseerd over de carcinogeniteit.
Twee zaken zijn van belang om hier onder uw  aandacht te brengen: de beschikbaarheid 
van de onderzoeksgegevens en de wijze waarop de risico’s zijn berekend. 
Ten eerste de onderzoeksgegevens. Een mogeli jk gevolg van langdurige blootstelling aan 
ethanol op de werkplek is kanker. V oor normstelling zijn de meest relevante vormen van 
kanker borstkanker (bij vrouwen) en darmkanker (bij mannen en vrouwen). Ook bij lage 
blootstellingen bestaat daarop namelijk een kleine kans. De Commissie Beoordeling Carci-nogeniteit van Stoffen heeft vastgesteld dat voor borstkanker een genotoxisch werkingsme-
chanisme niet is uit te sluiten. Dat wil zeggen dat ethanol (of een metaboliet) directe veranderingen in de DNA-structuur kan veroorzaken. V olgens de huidige wetenschappe-lijke inzichten is daarbij geen absoluut veilig niveau van blootstelling aan te geven. Daarom 
berekent de Gezondheidsraad concentratieniveaus in de lucht op de werkplek die horen bij 
vooraf door de overheid bepaalde kankerrisico’s. 
De commissie heeft zich bij het berekenen va n deze risico’s gebaseerd op studies naar 
de gevolgen van het drinken van alcoholische co nsumpties. Daarover is namelijk al veel 
bekend. Deze gegevens zijn ook geschikt om de risico’s van het inademen van ethanol op te werkplek te bepalen omdat voor borstkanker een genotoxisch werkingsmechanisme niet is 
uit te sluiten. In dat geval geldt dat de totale belasting relevant is voor het risico op kanker. 
Dus ongeacht de blootstellingroute.Gezondheidsraad           Voorzitter

 Het tweede punt is hoe die risico’s vervolgens zijn berekend. V oor stoffen waarvoor geen 
veilig niveau van blootstelling aan te geven is, berekent de commissie normaliter de con-centratieniveaus die horen bij een kans op 4 extra sterfgevallen per 1000 en 4 per 100 000. 
In dit geval heeft de commissie echter rekening gehouden met het feit dat ethanol ook in 
lage concentraties aanwezig is in het bloed van mensen die nooit alcohol consumeren. Dit 
wordt waarschijnlijk veroor zaakt door stofwisselingsproce ssen in het lichaam. Ook deze 
endogene ethanolconcentratie in het bloed draagt bij aan het risico op borstkanker, meent de commissie. Zij schat dat van elke 1000 vrouwen die overlijden er mogelijk 4 sterven aan borstkanker die wordt veroorzaakt door een le venslange, van nature voorkomende ethanol-
belasting. 
Wat betekent dit voor de berekening van het risico dat samenhangt met concentraties op 
de werkplek? Normaal gesproken wordt met twee risico’s gewerkt. Berekenen we het con-centratieniveau dat hoort bij een kans op 4 extra gevallen van overlijden door borstkanker 
per 100 000 sterfgevallen, dan resulteert dat echter in een blootstelling die veel lager is dan de endogene ethanolbelasting. De commissie acht het schatten van dit concentratieniveau op de werkplek daarom niet relevant.
Daarom heeft zij alleen het concentratieniveau berekend dat hoort bij een kans op 4 
extra gevallen van overlijden aan borstkanker per 1000 sterfgevallen. Dat risico treedt op 
bij een blootstelling aan 1300 milligram ethanol per kubieke meter lucht gedurende 40 arbeidsjaren. Het is dus vergelijkbaar met het ri sico op borstkanker door de ethanol die toch 
al in het bloed aanwezig is. 
Ik heb dit advies vandaag ter kennisname toegezonden aan de minister van V olksgezond-
heid, Welzijn en Sport, de minister van Soci ale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid en de staatssec-
retaris van V olkshuisvesting, Ruimtelijke Ordening en Milieu.

Vraagstelling
Op verzoek van de minister van Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid leidt de 
Commissie WGD van de Gezondheidsraad gezondheidskundige advieswaarden 
af voor stoffen in de lucht waaraan mensen beroepsmatig kunnen worden bloot-gesteld. Deze aanbevelingen vormen de eer ste stap in een drietrapsprocedure die 
moet leiden tot wettelijke grenswaarden,  aangeduid als maximaal aanvaarde con-
centraties (MAC-waarden).
In het voorliggende rapport bespreekt de commissie de gevolgen van bloot-
stelling aan ethanol. De conclusies van de commissie zijn gebaseerd op weten-
schappelijke publicaties die vóór januari 2006 zijn verschenen.
Fysische en chemische eigenschappen
Ethanol (CAS-nummer 64-17-5) is een heldere kleurloze vloeistof met een 
karakteristieke geur. De geurdrempel bedraagt ca. 95 mg/m3. Ethanol mengt 
goed met water en organische oplosmid delen. Het heeft een hoge dampspanning.
Ethanol is momenteel een van de meest gebruikte organische chemicaliën die 
worden toegepast in industriële en co nsumentenproducten, voornamelijk als 
intermediair bij de productie van a ndere chemicaliën (waaronder aceetaldehyde, 
ethylacrylaat en ethylch loride) en als oplosmiddel. Daarnaast zit ethanol (‘alco-
hol’) in alcoholische dranken.14 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Ethanol wordt endogeen in het menselij k lichaam gevormd. De concentratie 
ethanol in het bloed van mensen bedraagt gemiddeld 0.27 mg/l.
Monitoring
Door de Amerikaanse instanties NIOSH* en OSHA** zijn methoden beschreven 
voor het bepalen van de concentratie et hanol in lucht. Deze methoden zijn geba-
seerd op gaschromatograf ische analyse (GC-FID***).
Een methode voor de bepaling van ethanol in bloed met behulp van GC-FID 
is beschreven door de NIOSH. V oor het bepalen van de concentratie ethanol in 
de uitgeademde lucht zijn di verse aparaten op de markt.
Grenswaarden
De huidige bestuurlijke grenswaarde voor ethanol in de lucht op de werkplek 
bedraagt in Nederland 1000 mg/m3. Ook in Zweden geldt dit als grenswaarde, 
terwijl in Duitsland de zogeheten MAK-waarde**** 960 mg/m3 bedraagt. De 
grenswaarden in het Verenigd Koninkrijk en Denemarken en de door de Ameri-
can Conference of Industrial and Govern mental Hygienists (ACGIH) vastge-
stelde Threshold Limit Value (TLV) bedragen 1900 mg/m3 (1000 ppm).
In Duitsland geldt tevens een STEL-waarde***** van 4800 mg/m3 (2500 
ppm) voor een blootstelling gedurende dert ig minuten; met als restrictie dat deze 
maximaal twee keer per werkdag mag voorkomen. Zweden kent een grens-waarde voor blootstelling gedurende vijftien minuten van 1900 mg/m
3 (1000 
ppm). 
Duitsland heeft ethanol geclassificeerd als kankerverwekkende stof in cate-
gorie 5, wat inhoudt dat de genotoxisch-car cinogene activiteit zo laag is dat bij 
de MAK-waarde van 960 mg/m3 geen noemenswaardige bijdrage aan het kan-
kerrisico voor de mens te verwachten is. V oor de reproductietoxische effecten geldt een classificatie in groep 2, wat wil zeggen er dat geen reden tot zorg is bij 
de MAK-waarde van 960 mg/m
3.

***** Short Term Exposure LimitSamenvatting 15Kinetiek
Na inademing wordt ethanol voor ongeveer 60 procent door de longen geabsor-
beerd. Blootstelling via de ademhaling aan 1900 mg/m3 ethanol gedurende vier 
uur (bij rust), kan in het bloed tot ethanolconcentraties van ongeveer 2 mg/l lei-den. Ethanol kan ook via de huid worden opgenomen. V oor het berekenen van de interne dosis na huidblootstelling kan voor de snelheid van opname van ethanol door de huid een waarde van 0,7 mg per cm
2 huid gedurende 1 uur worden 
gehanteerd; Deze waarde zal in het alge meen de werkelijke opnamesnelheid 
overschatten. 
Ethanol wordt na orale opname efficiënt in het lichaam opgenomen (voor 
meer dan 90 procent). De ethanolconcentratie in het bloed wordt door verschei-dene factoren beïnvloed, waarvan voed selinname en geslacht de belangrijkste 
zijn. Na het drinken van twee alcoholische consumpties (ongeveer 20 gram etha-nol) kan de ethanolconcentratie in het bloed binnen een uur een maximale waarde bereiken van ongeveer 300 mg/l. D aarna neemt de concentratie weer snel 
af; binnen enkele uren is bij mensen de  ethanolconcentratie weer op het niveau 
zoals dat normaal in het lichaam voorkomt (endogeen niveau). 
Inhalatoire blootstelling aan 1900 mg/m
3 (overeenkomend met ongeveer 11 
gram ethanol per dag*) resulteert dus in een maximale ethanolconcentratie in het 
bloed die 10-100 keer kleiner is dan de bloedconcentraties na het drinken van één alcoholische consumptie (bevattend 11 gram ethanol). Veel effecten zijn gerela-
teerd aan de maximale ethanolconcentratie in het bloed; In die gevallen is de 
commissie van mening dat de gezondheidsrisico’s na inhalatoire blootstelling aan ethanol zullen worden overschat al s wordt uitgegaan van risico’s na con-
sumptie van vergelijkbare hoeveelheden. V oor de genotoxisch carcinogene effec-ten daarentegen is niet de maximale ethanolconcentratie in het bloed maar de totale interne ethanolbelasting
** van belang. Zoals hierboven aangegeven geldt 
hiervoor dat de interne ethanolbelasting na het drinken van een alcoholische con-
sumptie vergelijkbaar is met het inademen van 1900 mg/m3 ethanol gedurende 
acht uur. 
De lever is bij de mens het belangrijkste orgaan voor de afbraak van ethanol. 
Dat gebeurt in twee stappen: eerst wo rdt ethanol omgezet in aceetaldehyde en 
aansluitend wordt azijnzuur gevormd. 
* Uitgaande van 10 m3 ingeademde lucht per achturige werkdag en 60 procent opname door de longen.
** Het begrip ‘interne ethanolbelasting’ kan worden omschr even als het product van de bloed-ethanolconcentratie en 
de tijd dat die ethanolconcentratie in het lichaam  aanwezig is (AUC ofwe l Area Under the Curve)).16 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Effecten
Bij mensen
Wanneer mensen korter dan een uur een malig worden blootgesteld aan concen-
traties ethanol kleiner dan 1900 mg/m3 (1000 ppm) ondervinden ze geen irritatie 
in de luchtwegen of andere klachten. Bij blootstelling aan concentraties hoger dan 3000 mg/m
3 worden klachten als hoesten, droge keel en prikkeling van de 
neus gemeld. Blootstelling aan concentraties van 17 000 mg/m3 en hoger worden 
als onverdraaglijk beschreven. 
Bij hoge concentraties in de lucht is ethanol zeer irritere nd voor de ogen. 
Herhaalde blootstelling van de huid aan 95 procent ethanol leidt niet tot huidirri-tatie, maar kan door ontvetting wel een  droge huid veroorzaken. Occlusief con-
tact daarentegen kan tot roodheid en verdikking of verharding van de huid leiden. Het kan ook irritatieve contact dermatitis en non-immunologische netelroos ver-oorzaken. 
De meeste gegevens over de gevolgen voor mensen van langdurige blootstelling 
aan ethanol hebben betrekking op de consumptie van alcoholische dranken. Ver-scheidene epidemiologische onderzoekers rapporteren dat het verband tussen blootstelling aan ethanol en de algemene gezondheidstoestand van een persoon een U- of J-vorm lijkt te hebben: bij lage  consumptieniveaus is er sprake van een 
gezondheidskundig gunstig eff ect, zoals een verminderd ri sico op hart- en vaat-
ziekten, terwijl bij hogere niveaus de gezondheidstoestand achteruit gaat.
De meest kritische effecten na blootst elling aan ethanol betreffen kanker, 
levercirrose, vermindering van de vrucht baarheid en afwijkingen bij het nage-
slacht. Uit epidemiologisch onderzoek blijkt dat bij consumptie van minder dan 10 tot 12 gram per dag waarschijnlijk geen levercirrhose zal optreden. De Com-
missie Alcohol en zwangerschap van de Gezondheidsraad conc ludeerde in een 
begin 2005 uitgebracht advi es dat bij inname van d eze hoeveelheden ethanol er 
wel effecten op de vruchtbaarheid en de ontwikkeling van het nageslacht kunnen optreden; Ook stelde deze commissie dat langdurige blootstelling aan 1 tot 10 
gram ethanol mogelijk effecten kan veroorzaken op de vruchtbaarheid en op de ontwikkeling van het nageslacht (onder andere een verhoogde incidentie van 
spontane abortussen, foetal e dood, en vroeggeboortes en een verkorte zwanger-
schap). 
Met betrekking tot carcinogeniteit lijken borstkanker en colonkanker het 
meest relevant: onderzoek naar de gevolgen van langdurige consumptie van Samenvatting 17alcoholhoudende dranken laten een verh oging van het voorkomen van deze vor-
men van kanker zien. Uit een gecombineerde analyse van de gegegevens over borstkanker volgt dat een consumptiepatroon van 10 gram ethanol per dag het risico op borstkanker met 10 procent verhoogd. Een kwantitatieve schatting van het risico op colonkanker door alcoholgebruik is niet beschikbaar. 
Bij proefdieren
De laagste dosis waarbij proefdieren stierven na inademing van ethanol bedroeg 
bij muizen 55 000 mg/m
3 (7-uurs-blootstelling) en 25 000 mg/m3 bij ratten (22-
uurs-blootstelling). In één onderzoek gingen ratten na inhalatie van 385 mg/m3 
gedurende 45 minuten gedragsveranderingen vertonen. Na twee dagen blootstel-
ling aan vergelijkbare concentraties trad he t effect niet meer op en was kennelijk 
een tolerantie ontwikkeld. 
De laagst gerapporteerde letale dosis bi j blootstelling van de huid van konij-
nen bedraagt 20 g per kilogram lich aamsgewicht. Bij konijnen veroorzaakt 
occlusieve blootstelling aan zuivere ethanol milde irritatie van de huid en van de 
ogen.
Uit het schaarse proefdieronderzoek naar de gevolgen van herhaald inade-
menvan ethanol volgt dat hoge luchtconcentraties (resulterend in ethanolconcen-traties in het bloed van meer dan 1700 mg/l), slechts geringe toxiciteit bewerkstelligen.
Na herhaalde orale blootstelling blijkt ethanol bij proefdieren effecten te ver-
oorzaken in alle organen, het meest in de lever. Na toediening van ethanol via 
vloeibaar voedsel gedurende een periode van 30 dagen werden verhoogde con-
centraties van vetzuren en triglyceriden in de lever waargenomen.
Proefdieronderzoek naar de carcinogenite it van ethanol na langdurige inhala-
toire blootstelling zijn niet beschikbaar. Omdat de opzet van de proefdieronder-zoekn na langdurige orale blootstelling onvoldoende is, kan de commissie hieruit geen conclusies trekken. 
Er is geen overtuigend bewijs dat et hanol genotoxisch is, dat wil zeggen 
schade toebrengt aan het erfelijk materiaal  (DNA). Er zijn in enkele genotoxici-
teitstesten echter wel positieve resulta ten waargenomen. Omdat aceetaldehyde 
(een metaboliet van ethanol) een genoto xisch carcinogeen is en dit een rol zou 
kunnen spelen bij het ontstaan van kanker na ethanol blootstelling, adviseert de Commissie Beoordeling carcinogeniteit van stoffen van de Gezondheidsraad ethanol als een genotoxisch carcinogeen te beschouwen. 18 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Inhalatoire blootstelling van ratten aan ethanolconcentraties tot 30 400      
mg/m3, resulterend in bloed-ethanolwaarden van ongeveer 500 mg/l, had geen 
effect op de mannelijke vruchtbaarheid. Orale inname van 10 g ethanol per kg lichaamsgewicht per dag of meer resulteer de daarentegen bij ratten in een ver-
minderd reproductievermogen, verlaagde testosteronwaarden in het serum, en verminderd gewicht en atrofie van de te stikels. Bij mannelijke muizen was na 
een orale blootstelling van maximaal 0,6 gram ethanol per kg lichaamsgewicht 
per dag geen verandering in paargedrag  en zwangerschapsuitkomst waarneem-
baar. Uit ander onderzoek volgde dat orale inname van hoge doseringen ethanol (meer dan 2 gram per kg lichaamsgewicht per dag), geen invloed had op het paargedrag van vrouwelijke dieren.
V olgens de Commissie Alcohol en zw angerschap van de Gezondheidsraad 
resulteert inademing van concentraties ethanol tot 38 000 mg/m
3 gedurende de 
dracht bij vrouwelijke ratten niet in effecten op het nageslacht. Wel werden er bij deze blootstelling, die leidde tot een alco holconcentratie in het bloed van onge-
veer 2500 mg/l, toxische effecten bij de moederdieren gevonden. Blootstelling van mannelijke ratten aan concentraties tot 30 400 mg/m
3 resulteerde niet in ver-
anderingen in de nakomelingen. Zowel in ratten als in muizen is de ontwikkeling 
van het nageslacht verstoord na orale to ediening van grote hoeveelheden ethanol 
gedurende de dracht, resulterend in bloed-alcoholconcentraties van ongeveer 2000-6000 mg/l. 
Evaluatie en advies
In dit advies beoordeelt de Commissie WGD de gevolgen van beroepsmatige 
blootsteling aan ethanol. De commissie r ealiseert zich dat het drinken van alco-
holische dranken een grotere bijdrage zou kunnen leveren aan de dagelijkse etha-nolblootstelling dan de beroepsmatige blootstelling. Zij houdt hier echter geen rekening mee bij de schatting van het risico van beroepsmatige blootstelling 
omdat de commissie zich bij het bepalen van het risico baseert op de ook aanwe-
zige niet-drinkers. 
Gezondheidskundige advieswaarde (gemiddeld over 15 minuten)De gegevens over de effecten van inhalatoire blootstelling op mensen zijn 
schaars. Op grond van hetgeen wel bekend is, meent de commissie dat kortdu-
rende, eenmalige blootstelling aan ethanolconcentraties gelijk aan of kleiner dan 
1 900 mg/m
3 (1000 ppm) gedurende 1 uur, waarschijnlijk geen irritatie van de 
luchtwegen of andere klachten geeft. Bij concentraties groter dan 3000 mg/m3 Samenvatting 19worden klachten als hoesten, droge keel en prikkeling van de neus gemeld. De 
commissie adviseert daarom een advieswaarde van 1900 mg/m3, gedurende 15 
minuten (STEL). 
Gezondheidskundige advieswaarde (gemiddeld over 8 uur)
De commissie beschouwt de verhoogde kans op borstkanker na langdurige bloot-
stelling aan ethanol als het kritische effect. Op advies van de Commissie Beoor-
deling carcinogeniteit van stoffen, concludeert de commissie dat ethanol bewezen kankerverwekkend is voor de me ns (overeenkomend met EU-categorie 
1) en dat een genotoxisch mechanisme niet kan worden uitgesloten. De         Commissie WGD leidt daarom voor et hanol concentratie niveaus (HBC-OCRV
*) 
af in de lucht die samenhangen met een kans op 4 extra sterfgevallen door kanker 
per 1000 en 4 per 100 000. 
V oor het afleiden van de risicogetallen  gaat de commissie uit van onderzoek 
naar borstkanker. De commissie concludeert dat het regelmatig drinken van één alcoholische consumptie (ongeveer10 gram ethanol) per dag, de kans op borst-
kanker verhoogt met 7 tot 10 procent. Op basis van het hogere getal (overeenko-
mend met een RR van 1.1) schat de commissie de volgende risicogetallen:
•4×10
-5 gedurende 40 jaar beroepsmatige blootstelling aan 13 mg/m3 
•4×10-3 gedurende 40 jaar beroepsmatige blootstelling aan 1300 mg/m3.
Ethanol komt echter van nature voor in het bloed, ook bij mensen die nooit alco-
hol consumeren. Dit beteke nt dat ook deze mensen een interne ethanolbelasting 
hebben. V oor de door het lichaam zelf aangemaakte ethanol varieert een levens-
lange belasting van 8 tot 35 (mg/l) ×jaar. De bijdrage tot de ethanolbelasting na 
beroepsmatige blootstelling ge durende 40 jaar aan 13 mg/m3 bedraagt ongeveer 
0,2 (mg/l) ×jaar. De commissie is van mening  dat deze bijdrage wegvalt binnen 
de endogene ethanolbelasting en de vari atie daarin. Dat betekent dat deze bij-
drage het risico op borstkanker niet w ezenlijk beïnvloedt. Daarom vindt de com-
missie het niet zinvol een risicogetal te adviseren, dat hoort bij een kans van 4 
extra sterfgevallen door borstkanker per 100 000.
Zoals de commissie reeds hierboven h eeft aangegeven is er een kans op 4 
extra sterfgevallen als gevolg van borstkanker per 1000 bij 40 jaar beroepsmatige blootstelling aan 1300 mg ethanol per kubieke meter. 
* HBC-OCRV: Health based calculated occupatio nal cancer risk value, ofwel risicogetal.20 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Vervolgens heeft de commissie beoordeeld of bij een beroepsmatige blootstelling 
aan 1300 mg/m3, andere effecten dan kanker kunnen optreden bij werknemers. 
De Commissie Alcohol en zwangerschap van de Gezondheidsraad concludeerde 
dat zowel effecten op de ontwikkeling van het nageslacht als effecten op de vruchtbaarheid kunnen worden waargeno men na consumptie van 1 tot 10 gram 
per dag. De Commissie Alcohol en zwange rschap geeft in h aar advies ook aan 
dat deze effecten niet te relateren zijn  aan de eerder genoem de ethanolbelasting 
maar aan de maximale ethanolconcentraties in het bloed. Omdat de maximale ethanolconcentraties in bloed na het drinken van 10 gram ethanol 10-100 keer hoger ligt dan de bloed ethanol concentratie na inhalatoire blootstelling aan 1300 mg/m
3, is de commissie van mening dat een blootstelling aan 1300 mg/m3 vol-
doende bescherming biedt tegen deze eff ecten. Andere gezondheidseffecten tre-
den op bij hogere ethanol blootstelling. 
HuidnotatieDe commissie heeft tevens beoordeeld of voor ethanol een huidnotatie nodig is. 
Omdat dermale blootstelling een substantiële bijdrage kan leveren aan de interne 
belasting, stelt de Commissie WGD een huidnotatie voor.
Advies
De Commissie WGD schat dat de ethanolco ncentratie in de lucht die samenhangt 
met een kans op 4 extra sterfgevallen door borstkanker per 1000 sterfgevallen 
(4×10-3) bij een beroepsmatige blootstelling gedurende 40 jaar, 1300 mg/m3 
bedraagt. 
Daarnaast beveelt de commissie een advieswaarde voor een kortdurende 
blootstelling van 15 minuten van 1900 mg/m3 (STEL) aan en  een huidnotatie.Executive summary 21Executive summary
Scope
At the request of the Minister of Soci al Affairs and Employment, the Health 
Council of the Netherlands sets health-based recommended occupational expo-
sure limits for chemicals in air at the workplace. These recommendations are 
made by the Council’s Dutch Expert Committee on Occupational Standards (DECOS). They constitute the first step in a three-step pro cedure which leads to 
legally-binding limit values.
In the present report the committee di scusses the consequences of occupa-
tional exposure to ethanol.  The committee’s conclusions are based on scientific 
publications prior to January 2006.
Occurrence, physical and chemical properties
Ethanol (CAS registry number 64-17-5) is  a clear, colourless liquid with a pleas-
ant characteristic odour. The odour threshold is about 95 mg/m3. Ethanol is mis-
cible with water and organic solvents. It has a high vapour pressure.
Ethanol is currently one of the larges t-volume organic chemicals utilised in 
industrial and consumer products, primaril y as an intermediate in the production 
of other chemicals (ie acetaldehyde, ethylacr ylate and ethylchloride) and as a sol-
vent. In addition, ethanol is is present in alcoholic beverages.22 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Besides, ethanol is present endogenously in humans, which leads to a blood 
alcohol concentration of 0.27 (+/- 0.17) mg/l. 
Monitoring
Methods for the determination of ethanol in air have been described by NIOSH* 
and OSHA**, and are based on GC-FID.
A method for analysing ethanol in blood by GC-FID has been described by 
NIOSH. In addition, ethanol can be dete rmined in human breath samples as well.
Limit values
The current occupational exposure limit in the Netherlands and Sweden is 1000 
mg/m3 (500 ppm), whereas in Germany the limit is 960 mg/m3 (500 ppm). In the 
UK, Denmark, and the USA the occupational exposure limit is about 1900      
mg/m3 (1000 ppm). 
Short-term exposure limits have been set in Germany at 4800 mg/m3 (2500 
ppm; 30-min value) and Sweden 1900 mg/m3 (1000 ppm; 15-min value). In Ger-
many, ethanol has been assigned in Category 5 for carcinogenic effects ( i.e. the 
genotoxic carcinogenic potential is so low that the MAK*** value (500 ppm) will 
not represent an unacceptabl e risk level), in Group C for genotoxic effects ( i.e. 
the substance is shown to be genotoxic in studies performed in mammals), and 
Group 2 for reproduction toxic effects ( i.e. no need for concern at exposure lev-
els at/lower than the MAK level).****
Kinetics
Inhaled ethanol is absorbed by the lungs for about 60%. Exposure to 1900 mg/m3 
by inhalation for 4 hours, results in blood concentrations of approximately 2     mg ethanol/l (at rest). As a worst case estimate , a penetration rate of 0.7           
mg/cm
2/h can be used to calculate the in ternal dose after dermal exposure. 
Orally consumed ethanol is efficiently  absorbed (>90%). The blood ethanol 
concentration is influenced by a number of factors of which food intake and gen-
der are the most important. Consuming two alcoholic beverages (~20 gram etha-

** Occupational Safety and Health Administration*** Gas chromatography with flame ionization detector**** Maximale Arbeid splatzkonzentrationExecutive summary 23nol) results in a maximal blood concentration of approximately 300 mg ethanol/l; 
the maximal concentration in  blood is reached within a hour, but the concentra-
tion is decreased rapidly and the blood etha nol concentration has reached endog-
enous levels after several hours. 
Inhalatory exposure to 1900 mg/m3 ethanol (corresponding to 11 gram etha-
nol per day*) results in a maximal ethanol concentration in blood which is 10 to 
100 times lower than the maximal blood ethanol concentration after drinking one 
alcoholic beverage (approximately 11 gram  ethanol). Most effects are related to 
the maximal ethanolconcentration in blood. In that case DECOS is of the opinion that the health risks after oral exposure to ethanol will overestimate the risk of 
inhalatory exposure to comparable levels  of ethanol. For the genotoxic carcino-
genic effects, however, the total internal exposure
** is the relevant exposure esti-
mate. The total internal exposure (or AUC)  after drinking one glass of beer is 
comparable with the AUC after eight hour exposure to 1900 mg/m3 ethanol.
The human liver is the main site of ethanol oxidation. Ethanol degradation 
occurs in two steps, first the formatio n of acetaldehyde with a subsequent forma-
tion of acetic acid. 
Ethanol and acetaldehyde are oxidized by a wide range of enzymes and each 
of these enzymes may occur in different isoenzymes. Overall, ethanol and acetal-
dehyde are efficiently metabolized in Caucasians. A healthy subject is consid-ered to metabolize between 6 and 9 g ethanol per hour. The significance of the first-pass metabolism is most likely limited.
Effects
Human data Short-term inhalatory exposure to ethanol for one hour will not cause irritation or 
other effects below concentrations of 1900 mg/m
3 (1000 ppm). Concentrations 
higher than 3000 mg/m3 might result in transient cough, dry throat and tickling 
of the nose. Levels over 40,000 mg/m3 (21,000 ppm) are suffocating. 
In concentrated form, etha nol is very irritating to the eyes. Non-occlusive, 
repeated dermal exposure to 95% ethanol does not cause skin irritation, but may

** the total internal exposure is the pr oduct of the bloodalcoholconcentration (BAC) times the period present in the 
body, ( i.e. the Area Under the Curve AUC).24 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)cause dry skin due to defatting. Occl usive contact, in contrast, may induce 
erythema and induration (thickening/harden ing of the skin). It may also induce 
irritant contact dermatitis and non-immunologic urticaria.
Most human data on the effects of long term exposure to ethanol concern the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages. Several epidemiological studies reported 
that the dose-effect curve for ethanol and overall mortality app ears to be U- or J-
shaped; beneficial effects due to the consumption of low levels of ethanol are observed, like a reduced risk of coronary heart disease.
The most critical non-carcinogenic eff ects in humans appear to be liver cir-
rhosis and effects on the development of  offspring and fertility. Epidemiological 
studies suggest that consumption levels below 10-12 grams of ethanol per day, 
will probably not cause liver cirrhosis. However, the Committee on Alcohol con-
sumption and reproduction concluded that at these consumption levels effects on fertility and development have been reported. Even long term oral exposure to levels of 1-12 gram ethanol per day might result in effects on the development (like increased incidence of spontaneous abortion, foetal death, pre-term delivery 
and decreased length of gestation) and fertility, according to the Committee on 
Alcohol consumption and reproduction.
With respect to carcinogeni city the most relevant types of cancers appear to 
be breast and colorectal cancer. All the av ailable data concern the association of 
the consumption of alcoholic beverages and these cancer types. Pooled studies or meta-analyses can be used to estimate th e cancer risk in a quantitative way. Ade-
quate studies are only avai lable for breast cancer, resulting in a RR of 1.1 per 
each 10 grams of ethanol per day consumed . Such studies are not (yet) available 
for colorectal cancer.
Animal studiesThe lowest lethal dose by inhalation is 55000 mg/m
3 in mice (7 hrs exposure) 
and 25000 mg/m3 in rats (22 hrs). In one study, behavioural depression occurred 
in rats inhaling 385 mg/m3 for 45 minutes. 
The lowest reported lethal dermal dose for rabbits is 20 g/kg body weight. In 
rabbits acute occluded exposure to 95% ethanol caused mild irritation. 96% etha-
nol is mildly irritating to the eyes of the rabbit.
Available animal studies with repeated inhalatory exposure were only limited in 
design. From the available data it may be  concluded that at high concentrations Executive summary 25(i.e. resulting in blood alcohol concentrations > 1700 mg/l), only slight toxicity 
was observed.
After repeated oral administration to an imals, ethanol app ears to affect all 
organs with the liver as main target or gan. Increased hepati c concentrations of 
fatty acid and triglycerids were  observed after a 30-day administration of a liquid 
diet containing ethanol. 
No long-term inhalation carcinogenicity studies in animals have been found. 
Because in the long-term oral exposure studies in rats and mice the MTD was not 
reached, these studies are of limited valu e to evaluate the carcinogenic potential 
of ethanol.
There is no convincing evidence that ethanol is genotoxic. In a limited num-
ber of in vitro  as well as in vivo  genotoxicity tests, however, ethanol gave posi-
tive results. Because a role for on e of the major metabolites of ethanol, i.e. 
acetaldehyde (a known genotoxic carcinoge n) can not be excluded, the commit-
tee on the Evaluation of the carcinogenicity of chemical substances of the Health Council concluded that ethanol should be considered a genotoxic carcinogen.
According to the Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction of 
the Health Council, exposure of rats by inhalation to concentrations upto 30,400 
mg/m
3 ethanol, resulting in blood alcohol levels of about 500 mg/l, did not cause 
changes in male fertility. Oral intake of ethanol (ca. 10 g ethanol/kg bw/day or higher), in contrast, resulted in decreas ed reproductive performance, decreased 
serum testosterone levels, decreased testic ular weight and testicular atrophy in 
rats. An oral study in male mice at levels up to 0.6 g ethanol/kg bw/day) did not influence mating behaviour and pregnancy success. Other studies into the fertil-
ity effects of ethanol have shown that oral intake of high ethanol doses (> 2 g/kg 
bw/day) before and during pregnancy had no influence on mating behaviour of females.
In addition, the Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction con-
cluded that exposure of female rats by inhalation during pregnancy to concentra-tions upto 38,000 mg/m
3 ethanol, resulting in blood alcohol levels up to about 
2500 mg/l, did not cause developmental toxicity although maternal toxicity was 
observed. Exposure of male rats to  concentrations up to 30,400 mg/m3 did not 
show changes in paternal offspring. Teratogenic effects, however, were observed in rats and mice following oral intake of large amounts of ethanol during preg-nancy, resulting in blood alcohol levels of about 2000-6000 mg/l. No teratogenic effects were observed in mice after oral in take of ethanol resulting in blood alco-
hol levels of about 200 mg/l.26 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Health based occupational exposure limit
In this report, DECOS evaluates the eff ects of occupational exposure to ethanol. 
Although the committee ackno wledges the fact that drinking alcoholic beverages 
might be a more important source of ethanol exposure, this exposure is not taken into consideration for the assessment of  the effects after occupational exposure.
Recommendation of an HBROEL, 15-min TWA (STEL)
Although the human data are limited, the committee is of the opinion that inhala-
tory exposure to 1900 mg/m
3 ethanol for one hour will probably not cause local 
or systemic effects in man. Exposure to higher concentrations  will result tran-
sient cough, dry throat and tickling in the nose. In conclusion, DECOS is of the opinion that exposure to 1900 mg/m
3 for 15 minutes will be low enough to pro-
tect workers for effects after short term  exposure. DECOS therefore recommends 
a short term exposure limit of 1900 mg/m3.
Recommendation of an HBC-OCRV
The committee considers the development of breast cancer afte r exposure to eth-
anol as the critical effect. Based on th e advice of the Comm ittee Evaluation of 
Carcinogenic substances that ethanol is known to be carcinogenic to humans 
(comparable to EU category 1) and that a genotoxic mechanism cannot be 
excluded, DECOS calculates occupationa l cancer risk values for ethanol. 
From the available meta-analysis an d pooled studies, the committee con-
cluded that drinking of one glass of alcoholic beverage (~10 gram ethanol) per day would increase the risk for breast cancer with 7-10%. From a RR of 1.1, DECOS calculates the following HBR-OCRVs:
•4×10
-5 for 40 years of occupational exposure to 13 mg/m3 
•4×10-3 for 40 years of occupational exposure to 1300 mg/m3.
However, ethanol is present in the human body of non-drinkers as well, which 
results in a total internal ethanol dose for lifetime (80 years) of 21.6 ( ±13.6)   
(mg/l)×year. On the other hand, occupational ethanol exposure to 13 mg/m3 (cor-
responding to a extra cancer risk of 4 ×10-5) gives an internal dose of approxi-
mately 0.2 (mg/l) ×year. DECOS is of the opinion that an internal dose of 0.2 
(mg/l)×year as a result of occupational exposure to 13 mg/m3 is negligible as 
compared to the internal dose due to the endogenous ethanol concentration in Executive summary 27blood ((22 mg/l) ×year). Consequently, the committ ee considers the relevance of 
the calculation of an HBC-OCRV corresponding to a risk of 4 ×10-5 doubtful. 
Therefore, DECOS estimates the HBC-OCRV of 1300 mg/m3 corresponding 
to an additional br east cancer risk of 4 ×10-3. 
Subsequently, the committee evaluated whether this HBC-OCRV of 1300 mg/m3 
is low enough to protect workers against other toxic effects. According to the 
Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction, first signs of develop-mental toxicity and effects on fertility manifest after drinking one alcoholic con-sumption per day or less (<10 gram ethanol per day). However, for these effects DECOS is of the opinion that the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the rele-vant exposure parameter. Considering th e fact that the maximal alcohol concen-
tration in blood after one (oral) drink is approximately 10-100 times higher than 
the ethanol concentration in blood after inhalatory exposure to1300 mg/m
3, the 
committee is of the opinion that a HBC-OCRV of 1300 mg/m3 is low enough to 
protect against these effects. Other toxic effect manifest after exposure to higher 
exposure levels. 
Skinnotation
At request of the minister of Social  Affairs and Employment, the committee 
judged wheteher for ethanol is skin notation is needed. As dermal exposure can substantially contribute to the body burden of ethanol, DECOS recommends a skin notation.
Health based calculated occupational cancer risk value
DECOS calculates an H BC-OCRV of 1300 mg/m3, resulting in a breast cancer 
risk of 4 additional death cases per 1000 (4*10-3) deaths for 40 years. 
In addition, DECOS recommends a sh ort term exposure limit (STEL) of 
1900 mg/m3 twa 15 minutes and a skin notation.28 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Scope 291 Chapter
Scope
1.1 Background
In the Netherlands, occupational exposure limits for chemical substances are set 
using a three-step procedure. In the first step, a scientific evaluation of the data 
on the toxicity of the substance is made by the Dutch Expert Committee on 
Occupational Standards (DECOS), a com mittee of the Health Council of the 
Netherlands, on request of the Minister of Social Affairs and Employment (Annex A). This evaluation should, if po ssible, lead to a health-based recom-
mended exposure limit for the concentration of the substa nce in the air. Such an 
exposure limit cannot be derived if sufficient  data are not available, or if the toxic 
action cannot be evaluated using a threshol d model. In the latter case, an expo-
sure-response relationship is recommended for use in regulatory standard setting.
In the next phase of the three-step procedure the Social and Economic Coun-
cil advises the Minister on th e feasibility of using the health based value as a reg-
ulatory Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL ) or recommends a different OEL. In 
the final step of the procedure, the Mi nister of Social Affairs and Employment 
sets the official Occupational Exposure Limit.30 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)1.2 Committee and method of work
The present document contains the assess ment of DECOS, hereafter called the 
committee, of the health h azard of ethanol. The member s of DECOS are listed in 
Annex B. The draft document has been prepared by PMJ Bos, JHE Arts, RA 
Bausch-Goldbohm, S Dekkers, HFJ Hendriks, K Nordheim and C de Heer of the Toxicology Division of TNO Nutrition a nd Food Research, Zeist, the Nether-
lands.
With respect to the genotoxic properties of ethanol, DECOS has consulted 
the Committee on the Evaluation of the car cinogenicity of chemical substances 
of the Health Council of the Netherland s. The committee’s advi ce is included in 
Annex D. 
In 2005, the DECOS released a draft of the report for public review. The indi-
viduals and organisations that commented on the draft are listed in Annex C. The DECOS has taken these comm ents into account in deciding on the final version 
of the report.
1.3 Data
Since the amount of data on ethanol is  enormous, the committee has chosen a 
specific strategy for gatherin g the necessary data. Several evaluations were used 
as starting point for the literature search 1-4,5. These evaluations were used as 
basis. If considered relevant the original publications were studied. The literature search was limited to reviews published in recent years, i.e. covering 1997-2001, 
in addition to the literature covered by the regarding evaluations. Key words 
were: ethanol or 64-17-5 and toxic* or adverse or kinet* or metabol* or expos* or development* or reproduct* or embryo* or feto* or foeto*. For the evaluation 
of the effects of ethanol on reproduction, DECOS followed the evaluation of the 
Committee on Alcohol Consumption and Reproduction of the Health Council of the Netherlands, published in 2004
6.
For the preparation of this document, literature has been retrieved from 
online databases such as Medline, Toxl ine and Chemical Ab stracts-plus (last 
update online search was performed on 21 May 2001). For specific aspects, more 
recent literature was consulted afterwards.
The search resulted in 1043 hits. The abstracts were screened and a selection of 
approximately 120 reviews was chosen fo r further evaluation. Original publica-
tions, referred to in these reviews, we re studied when considered relevant. Scope 31In addition, HSDB, RTECS, Merck, EINECS (on CD-ROM) and IPCS 
(online) were also consulted (last update: 21 May 2001).
In 2004, an additional search was performed in Pubmed using the keywords: 
inhalat* and ethanol; breast cancer and ethanol. References published between 2004 and 2006 were no reason for the committee to adjust her recommendation.32 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Identity, properties and monitoring 332 Chapter

14Identity, properties and monitoring 352.4 Validated analytical methods
2.4.1 Environmental monitoring
NIOSH method 1400 is suitable for meas uring the concentration of ethanol in 
air15. A known volume of air is drawn throug h coconut shell char coal to trap the 
organic vapours present. The analyte is desorbed with carbon disulphide contain-
ing 1 percent 2-butanol, and quantified. The sample is then separated and ana-
lysed by a gas chromatograph with a fl ame ionisation detector (GC-FID). The 
recommended sample volume is 0.1 to 1 litre at a flow rate of 0.05 l/min, with a working range of 16-1000 ppm (30-1900 mg/m
3) for a 1-litre sample. Accuracy 
is ±14%.
OSHA method no.100 is recommended for measuring the ethanol concentration 
in air16. Samples are collected by drawing air through two 8-mm o.d. Anasorb 
747 sampling tubes connected in series. The front tube contains 400 mg of adsor-bent, and the back tube 200 mg. The samples are desorbed with a 60/40 N,N-
dimethyl-formamide/carbon disulfide solution and analysed by a gas chromato-graph using a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID). The recommended air volume and sampling rate is 12 litres at 0.05 l/min. With a reliable quantitation limit of 
0.68 ppm (1.29 mg/m
3), the target concentration is 1000 ppm (1900 mg/m3). This 
method was developed to improve a similar OSHA method (based on NIOSH 1400 described above), as this method app eared to be prone to sample migration 
and has a low sampling capacity.
2.4.2 Biological monitoring
NIOSH method 800215 may be used to measure the concentration of ethanol in 
blood by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID). A sam-ple of venous blood is drawn into a 5 ml heparin-coated vacuum tube after 2 hrs of exposure. The detection range is 0.01- 0.6 mg/ml with a recovery of 0.98 at 
0.05 mg/ml blood.
Alcohol can be determined in breath samples of humans as well (in mg per 
liter breath) by a variety of methods. The most commonly used alcohol breath analyzers quantify the etha nol concentration by meas uring the absorbtion of 
infrared radiation
17. Since other infrared absorbing components (eg acetone in 
diabetics) may be present in breath, it is  essential to measure at numerous wave-
lengths. Differentiation between two in frared-absorbing components and quanti-36 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)tation of one of them requires at least measurement at two wavelengths (usually 
3.4 and 9.5 μm) plus, usually, a third isos bestic point in the spectrum. Sources 373 Chapter
Sources
3.1 Natural occurrence
Ethanol occurs naturally as a volatile plan t isolate e.g. in beans, and is produced 
by natural fermentation of carbohydrates. Ethanol is also found as a microbial activity product of animal wastes
18. Some reports also suggest a natural endoge-
nous production of ethanol in humans, possibly by microbes in the gut1. 
Sprung et al.  measured the blood alcohol con centration (BAC) in man due to 
endogenous ethanol of 0.27 (+/- 0.17 mg/l)19.
3.2 Man-made sources
3.2.1 Production
The main industrial production methods of ethanol are (1) synthetic from ethyl-
ene, (2) as a by-product of certain industrial operations, or (3) by the fermenta-
tion of carbohydrates (sugar, cellulose or starch)12. On an industrial scale, the 
synthetic production of ethanol far exceeds its pr oduction by fermentation12. 
The main process of synthesising ethanol from ethylene in the period 1930-
ca 1970, was by indirect hydration (sulphuric acid process). It was almost phased out in the early 1970s by the direct hydration process, developed to eliminate the use of sulphuric acid. There are two main categories for direct hydration of ethyl-38 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)ene to ethanol, of which the first is mo st frequently employed:(1) vapour-phase 
processes contact a solid or liquid catal yst with gaseous reactants, while (2) 
mixed-phase processes contact a solid or liquid catalyst with liquid and gaseous reactants
10. The bulk of ethylene produced in the USA is used to synthesise etha-
nol. Anhydrous etha nol is manufactured industria lly by azeotropic distillation12.
Alternative processes for synthesising et hanol exist, but are not utilised on a 
commercial scale10. These include hydration of ethy lene in the presence of dilute 
acids (weak sulphuric acid pr ocess); hydration of  ethyl ether; conversion of acet-
ylene to acetaldehyde, followed by hydrogena tion of the aldehyde  to ethyl alco-
hol; and the Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis10. 
Ethanol can be produced by fermentation of any material containing carbo-
hydrates (sugar), however the yield from the three main raw materials, sugars, 
starches and cellulose, varies. Sugars from  e.g. sugar cane, sugar beets, molasses 
and fruits can be converted to ethanol di rectly, with a high yield. Starches (from 
grains, potatoes and root crops) must be hydrolysed to fermentable sugars by enzymes from malt or moul d. The fermentation of cellulose (from e.g. wood 
agricultural residues, waste sulphite liquo r from pulp) is possible by pre-treat-
ment with mineral acids, which converts the cellulose to fermentable sugars. 
However, the final yield will be <35%. 
The ethanol is purified after production to remove unwanted impurities, 
mainly by distillation, fractionation or h ydrogenation to convert aldehyde impu-
rities to alcohols. Dependent on the intend ed use, the resulting product will vary 
in proof (ie. the percentage of et hanol in an alcohol/water mixture.)
10
In Europe, the total production of ethanol is 1.2 million tonnes20. The non-
beverage part of the production is currently (2001) 650,000 tons/year, with 
400,000 tons used as a solvent and 250,000 tons for further processing20. The 
yearly capacity in the USA is close to 7 million tons, of which 6 million tons account for beverage and fuel use. Approx imately 850,000 tons are used in the 
industrial setting
20.
3.2.2 Use
Historically, ethanol has b een used extensively as an tifreeze in the US, but is 
now largely replaced by ethylene glycol . Ethanol has already for a long time 
been important in the prod uction of acetaldehyde, ethyl acrylate, ethyl chloride, 
n-butanol and butadiene. Intermittently, high fuel prices and low grain profits 
have stimulated research into the use of ethanol as a fuel, and a blend of 10% eth-
anol and 90% petroleum based unleaded fuel (“gasohol”) or neat ethanol has on Sources 39several occasions alleviated fuel shortage s. In the United States, there is signifi-
cant use of ethanol as a automotive fuel component20,21. 
Industrial ethanol is curre ntly one of the largest-vol ume organic chemicals uti-
lised in industrial and consumer products, primarily as an intermediate in the pro-
duction of other chemicals and as a solvent. The syntheses of ethylene, glycol 
ethers, vinegar, ethlyamines, ethyl ether and ethyl vinyl ether are all performed 
with ethanol as a reactant10. Ethanol is an essential raw material in the manufac-
ture of drugs, plastics, lacquers, plastic izers, polishes, perfumes and cosmetics12. 
As opposed to the decreasing use as an in termediate in chemical synthesis, its 
use as a solvent has recently increased su bstantially. Products include soap and 
cleaning preparations, solven ts, antiseptic agent, vinegar, cosmetics, ink and 
coating formulations, and pharmaceuticals. 
Finally, ethanol is produced for the alcoholic beverages industry12.40 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Exposure 414 Chapter
Exposure
4.1 General population
The main source of alcohol exposure for the general population is by drinking 
alcoholic beverages. In the Netherland s, about 85-90% of the general population 
(16-65 years) is drinking alcoholic beverages now and then (CBS-Statline). In 
addition, man can be exposed orally to et hanol via its natural occurrence in foods 
like beans and cheese, and via c onsumption of foods, flavourings, 
pharmaceuticals18, although regulation of its use minimises the possibility of oral 
ingestion12. Concentrations in the lima bean , common bean, mung bean and soy 
bean varied from 2.9-15 mg/kg18. The concentration in alcoholic beverages is 
measured in percent, e.g. wine will contain ~12% ethanol. Dermal exposure 
occurs via ethanol-containing cosmetics, perfumes and drugs used topically12. 
The possibility for exposure by inhalation of vapours is considerable, due to the 
diverse applications of ethanol, and its volatile properties12. Concentrations in 
simple hydrocarbon exhaust (benzene, isooctane) were reported to be less than 1.14 mg/m
3. The ambient air concen tration varies according to the proximity of 
the sources. While rural areas had an average of 0.76-1.46 μg/m3, concentrations 
in urban areas were 0.95-<190 μg/m3 (all measured in the USA)18. 42 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)4.2 Working population
Occupational exposure will mainly occur by inhalation, and secondarily via der-
mal absorption12. The exposure happens in sett ings associated with its 
manufacture18, by use in synthesis, use as a so lvent, and when released as a prod-
uct of fermentation, decomposition or combustion18. An overview of data avail-
able on ethanol exposure in various work-r elated areas is presented in Table 4.14.

Table 4.2 is a representation of studi es performed on workers occupationally 
exposed to ethanol. The exposure during an  8-hr shift was meas ured with station-
ary and/or personal equipment. In several settings31,37 the employees were 
exposed to a number of solvents, and it proved very difficult to allocate com-
plaints to a specific substance. E.g., workers exposed to formaldehyde, ethanol 
and other solvents via spray painting wood with acid-hardening lacquers com-plained about effects in the upper mucous  membranes, primarily the nose, eyes 
and throat. These effects were ascribed to  formaldehyde, as this was the only sol-
vent where the mean ex posure level (0.48 mg/m

to cause irritation (0.1-0.3 mg/m3)31.Laboratorye55 . 9 - 8d39

Kinetics
5.1 Absorption
Ethanol can be absorbed easily across the surface of the gastroin testinal tract, the 
lungs and the skin. The passage of ethanol across biological membranes occurs through a process of passive diffusion al ong concentration grad ients. Because of 
the low molecular weight and high water and lipid solubility, ethanol moves 
through the same transmembrane channels  that allow the passage of water and 
lipid membranes.
5.1.1 Inhalation
There is a considerable gap in knowledge regarding the respiratory intake of eth-
anol. The kinetics of inhaled ethanol pose unique situations that differ from the ingestion of ethanol. In humans, for example, approximately 60%
45 or (30-
76%)46 of inhaled ethanol is absorbed. However, the relatively low retention fol-
lowing inhalation appears not to be due to metabolism47. Instead, the loss is a 
result of the wash-in-wash-out effect observed with water-soluble chemicals48. 
Briefly, as a water-soluble gas is inhaled,  it dissolves in the mucous lining of the 
upper respiratory tract. It then diffuses from a region of higher concentration 
(lumen) to a region of lower concentration (the epithelial cells and blood capil-laries). During exhalation, the opposite occurs: the gas diffuses from the epithe-46 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)lial cells and blood capillaries back into the lumen. Consequently, the net result is 
that some of the gas desorbs and is exha led as is observed with other water-solu-
ble chemicals such as methanol48-50.
Campbell et al.51 studied the effect of ethanol exposure on the Blood Alcohol 
Concentration (BAC) and exposed one male volunteer for 3 hours to 1900 mg ethanol/m
3. Blood samples were taken at 0, 35, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after 
exposure. Exposure to 1900 mg/m3 (at rest, ventilation rate was 6 l/min) did not 
result in detectable amounts of ethanol in venous blood (detection limit was 2 mg/l). The main factors which will affect  the respiratory uptake of ethanol are: 
the concentration of ethanol in the inspired  air, the rate of ventilation, and the 
percentage of lung clearance. Using a ki netic model, the authors calculated that 
when a human volunteer, engaged in very heavy  physical activity (ventilation 
rate of 50 l/min), was exposed to 1900 mg/m
3, a maximal blood alcohol concen-
tration (BACmax) of 20 mg/l (see figure 5.1) would be expected.

tion limit of the analytical me thod used in this study (2  mg/L) (adapted from Campbell et al.51).
Kinetics 47In the first of two series of experiments of Seeber et al. , volunteers (12 male and 
12 female) were exposed to 150, 750 and 1,500 mg/m3 (80, 400 and 800 ppm) 
for 4 hours. In the second experiment, volunteers (8 male and 8 female) were exposed for 4 hours to (1) 1,900 mg/m
3 (1000 ppm) constantly or to (2a) with an 
hourly change between 190 and 3,610 mg/m3 (100 and 1900 ppm, respectively) 
or (2b) 3610 mg/m3 and 190 mg/m3 (1900 and 100 ppm). The ventilation rate of 
the volunteers was approximately 6 l/min. The maximal measured blood alcohol 
concentrations (BACmax) in the first experiment increased from 0.23, 0.85 to 2.1 
mg/l (at 150, 750 and 1500 mg/m3 respectively) and in the second experiment to 
0.66-5.6 mg/l. There was a linear correlation (rxy = 0.49, p< 0.001) between the 
ethanol exposure in the air and the blood ethanol concentrations52.
A PBPK model for inhaled ethanol was developed by Lester and Greenberg 
in both mice and rats and both models were compared. Subsequently, these mod-
els have been applied to the human situation mainly in relation to inhaled ethanol vapors during refuelling. The model was very accurate to predict rat, mice and 
human (male) blood ethanol concentrations
53. Most modellers compare their 
modelling data with this study of Lest er and Greenberg. Simulated blood ethanol 
concentrations in human males follo wing exposures to 95 and 1,140 mg/m3 (50 
and 600 ppm) ranged from 7 to 23 μM (320-1100 mg/l) and from 86 to 293 μM 
(4000-13000 mg/l), respectively54. The model was criticized for the incorrect 
breathing rates used for subjects55 (Table 5.1). Conolly et al.  adjusted the PBPK 
model, and calculated that at an exposure level of up to 9,500 mg/m3 (5,000 
ppm) for 8 hours whilst “sitting awake” (ventilation rate 9 l/min) ethanol metab-olism was not saturated and the liver was able to metabolize the ethanol at the 
rate at which it entered the body.

of breath per working day at 1900 mg/m3 (1000 ppm), pulmonary intake (at an 
absorption efficiency of 60% (see above) ) may increase up to 11.4 g of ethanol. 
This corresponds to drinking a little over 1 standard glass of an alcoholic bever-age. 
5.1.2 Oral
Ethanol ingestion is rarely instantaneous. Even in research settings, ingestion 
may be spread out over some time. Therefore, the input model may be better described by a constant rate input process (zero-order) than an instantaneous input. Absorption across the intestinal wall is most likely diffusion-limited and a 
first order model (concentration dependent) would provide a simple description. 
A combination of a “constant rate input” model for input and a “diffusion-limited first order” model for diffusion will provide the simplest description of the absorption phase. The model may be fu rther refined by accounting for transfer 
from the stomach to the small intestin e where the bulk of ethanol absorption 
takes place, by introducing a lag time in the zero-order input model or by intro-
ducing a first order model for gastric emptying
56. 
Ethanol is absorbed over almost the entire length of the digestive tract. More 
than 90% of all ethanol consumed is absorbed. Absorption from the mouth and oesophagus is minimal. Ethanol absorption from the stomach may vary between 10 and 30%
57. The remainder of the ethanol is absorbed from the duodenum and 
small intestine. Some absorption may also occur in the large intestine. 
Saliva and digestive juices may dilute ethanol consumed. Israel et al.58 sug-
gested that dilution is subs tantial, because he observed  that 10%-20% (v/v) etha-
nol solutions resulted in a maximum ethanol concentration of about 3% (v/v) in the jejunum.
Gastrointestinal absorption is determined by many different factors including 
ethanol dose and concentratio n. Also, an efficient blood circulation will maintain 
the concentration gradient throughout the intestinal mucosa and maintain a high 
rate of absorption by rapidly removing the ethanol absorbed. The presence or 
absence of food and its composition may affect ethanol absorption and its subse-quent metabolism
59.Kinetics 49Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) after 
oral exposure
Blood alcohol profiles were determined in human volunteers (n = 8) after drink-
ing one or two beers. The BACmax reached after consuming 6 gram ethanol (one 
bottle of light beer) was 80 mg/l (ranging from 20-110 mg/l). Drinking 20 g etha-
nol (two bottles ‘normal’ beer) resulted in a maximum BAC of 320 mg/l (empty 
stomach) or 240 mg/l (after a meal)60. 
From these BACs the AUCs (Area unde r the curve, ie BAC * time) were 
determined in human volunteers (n = 8) after two beers. The AUC after drinking 20 g of ethanol was approximately 150 mg/ml x hour (empty stomach) or 130 mg/ml x hour (after a meal).
Influence of ethanol dose and conc entration on blood ethanol concentra-
tion
Ethanol is absorbed at a high rate. The quantity of ethanol absorbed per unit of 
time across the gastric or intestinal mucosa  is directly proportional to the concen-
tration gradient between gastric or intest inal lumen, epithelial cells, capillaries 
and the portal vein. Several studies have shown that increasing doses of ethanol 
when provided in the same concentration, result in a proportionately higher max-imal blood ethanol concentration (or blood alcohol concentration; BAC
max), 
whereas the rate of absorption (represented  by the slope of the ascending part of 
the BAC curve) is not affected60,61. 
Varying the concentration of ethanol cons umed appears to have an effect on 
the slope of the ascending part of the BAC curve. This was shown in experiments varying the concentration of ethanol without changing the dose
62,63 and by exper-
iments lowering the concentration by ad sorbing ethanol using active charcoal64. 
This relation is, however, not linear for all concentrations applied in healthy human volunteers. Pikaar et al.
61 also showed that rela tively high concentrations 
of ethanol (29,000 mg/l) did not increase the BAC fu rther, probably because 
these concentrations delay gastric emptying.
Gastric emptying and intestinal absorptionGastric emptying is an important factor in  determining the availability of ethanol 
to the duodenum and jejunum. Since the absorption is much higher from the 50 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)intestines than from the stomach, gastric emptying is relevant to ethanol absorp-
tion.
Every physiological or pharmacological factor affecting gastric emptying 
may modify the absorption rate of ethano l. The presence of food in the stomach 
is the most important factor in dela ying gastric emptying, which prolongs the 
absorption of lower dosages of ethanol. Delaying ethanol absorption in the intes-
tine, results not only in a lower BACmax, but also in a smaller area under the 
blood ethanol curve (area-under-the-curve, AUC) compared with drinking on an empty stomach
65. The amount of ethanol absorbed may be lower, because a 
larger part of the ethanol may be meta bolised during the presence in the stomach 
and the intestine. Alternativ ely, the ethanol is absorb ed into the blood over a 
longer period of time, which means that the elimination of ethanol has already 
set in. Also, the AUC may not reflect the bioavailability of ethanol under these 
conditions. AUC only accurately reflects bi oavailability if en try into the body 
and exit from it are first-order processes66. This however, may not be the case in 
ethanol metabolism; ethano l elimination proceeds over  a wide concentration 
range as a pseudo zero-order process56. 
Type of food
Foods enriched with proteins have been suggested to be more successful in 
reducing the maximum BAC as compared to foods enriched  with carbohydrate 
or fat61. Fats have often been considered to  exert a stronger effect than carbohy-
drates because of the strong er inhibitory effect of fa t on gastric emptying. In a 
recent experiment, however, fats and carbohydr ates did not differ  in their effect 
on BACmax65. McFarlane et al.67 show that the delay in ethanol absorption 
caused by dietary fats exactly paralleled the delay in gastric emptying, there was no direct interaction between  the food and the ethanol. 
Clarke et al.
68 and others studied the effects of various carbohydrates, like 
fructose, sorbitol and glucose. Carbohydr ates lower the BAC, possibly by reten-
tion in the intestinal lumen of water and consequently of etha nol. These effects, 
however, are only observed using extremely high quantities of carbohydrates and 
may therefore be considered to be physiologically irrelevant.
Some milk and dairy products are consider ed to be particularly effective in 
lowering the BAC69, however others did not confirm this. Presumably, milk 
taken on an empty stomach has some effect by delaying gastric motility and diluting the ethanol. Kinetics 51In experiments with rats, caffein proves to have a delaying effect on gastric 
emptying owing to relaxation of the gastric musculature resulting in a lower BAC, particularly when caffe ine is administered a quarte r of an hour before etha-
nol was ingested. Overall, the type of food appears to be of little importance, rather the caloric content of  the meal may be more important than the type of 
food from which the calories are derived
70.
Type of alcoholic beverages
The rate of absorption of th e three main types of alc oholic beverages (beverages 
containing ethanol) has been investigated both in a fasted state as well as after 
eating a meal. Alcoholic beverages cons umed on an empty stomach within a 
short period of time show that the maximum BAC was greatest after spirits and 
least after beer with the time to reach the peak being shortest with spirits and 
longest with beer63. These results may be explained by the differences in ethanol 
concentration as well as in differences in  volume leading to differences in gastric 
emptying time. 
Similar experiments have been performed drinking alcoholic beverages in 
combination with a meal. Roine et al.63 described, surprisingly that beer yields a 
higher BACmax than whiskey. This result is not confirmed by others in a dietary 
controlled experiment in 11 middle-aged men consuming 40 g of ethanol daily either as beer, wine or spirits with th eir evening meal usin g a cross-over design
71. 
Dinner consumed with beer or wine yields a lower BACmax (on average 420    
mg/l and 440 mg/l, respectively) as compared to dinner with spirits (510 mg/l) 
after one hour. After three hours spirit co nsumption still results in a higher   
BACmax (290 mg/l) as compared to wine consumption (260 mg/l), which is 
higher as compared to beer  consumption (200 mg/l).  Similar tendencies are 
obtained in a short-term di etary controlled experiment72. These differences how-
ever are small. The amount drunk as well  as the presence or absence of food in 
the stomach is the major determinant of the blood ethanol concentration.
Drugs 
Drugs may also alter ethanol absorption, ap parently as a result of their effects on 
gastric motility. These drugs include as pirin, aminopyrine and anticholinergic 
drugs slowing down absorption whereas cholinergic drugs in crease the absorp-
tion rate slightly73.52 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)5.1.3 Dermal
Sixteen healthy volunteers (8 males and 8 fe males) sprayed test material (aerosol 
cans containing 44% ethanol next to 55% of hydrocarbon propellant gas) over 
their entire body for approximately 10 seconds and waited 15 minutes before they dressed. Blood samples were then drawn at 0, 5, 10, 30 and 60 min and anal-ysed together with a blood sample taken before the experiment. The samples were analysed on two different GC co lumns. In combinat ion these columns 
could identify ethanol uniquely. With a (high) detection limit of 9 mg/l no etha-
nol was positively detected in any blood sample
74. 
Ethanol penetration has been studied in vitro  in full thickness skin samples from 
mice, rats, rabbits and humans. Human samples have been obtained from female breast and male and female a bdomen. Dose volumes of 250 μl [
14C] ethanol in a 
25% (v/v) aqueous solution have been applied in specific chambers on 1.77 cm2 
skin (approximately 28 mg ethanol/cm2). Sealing the chambers with a glass stop-
per prevented evaporative losses. Exposure lasted for 6 hours during which efflu-
ent samples were collected at va rious intervals. The fraction of 14C that 
penetrated the skin was determined from the sum of effluent radioactivity divided by the total amount of radioactivity initially applied. In total 175 experi-ments were performed over 6 years. Sta tistically comparisons of permeability 
constants (k
p) reveals that the order of skin permeability is rabbit>mouse>rathu-
man. In humans, the permeability constant amounts to 3.4*10-3cm/h. No differ-
ences in kp were observed between the differen t sites of human skin and between 
males and females. The penetration rate at steady state for human skin was calcu-
lated to be 0.67 mg/cm2/h. For human skin a total mean of 9.9% of the applied 
dose was recovered from the effluent75. However, it is noted that the amount of 
ethanol remaining in the skin was not determined. The absorption percentage 
may therefore be underestimated, although Pendlington et al.  reports relatively 
low amounts of ethanol in the sk in after 24 h ours of exposure74.
Scott et al.76 reported 10 times lower kp values (3.17*10-4cm/h) for human 
abdominal skin than Beskitt and Sun75. Skin samples were mounted in glass dif-
fusion chambers that consisted of an open-top donor ch amber and receptor 
chamber (volume ~ 5 ml). Regular samples of fluid in the receptor chamber were 
collected during a 6-hour exposure period. However, from their report the 
applied dose is not clear, but may possibly be >100 μl/cm2 of a 1 mg/ml aqueous 
solution of [14C] ethanol. In that case, it might be questioned whether the dose Kinetics 53was high enough for the assessment the kp. Hence the validity of the reported kp 
is doubted. 
Dermal absorption has also been studied in vitro  with full thickness pig skin with 
and without occlusion (using parafilm). A dose of 13 μl/cm2 (10 mg/cm2) of 
[14C] ethanol has been applied to the skin for 24 hours. The initial flux rate under 
occlusion was over ten times greater than the flux rate for non-occluded skin. 
The maximum flux for the non-occluded skin was r eached by the first hour, 
whereas the flux rate (maximal 0.25 mg/cm2/h) for the occluded skin peaked at 
two hours. The recovery from the recep tor fluid was 21.17% and 0.97% for 
occluded and non-occluded skin, respectively. Analyses of upper skin washes, skin digests and cell washes revealed on ly small amounts of radio-activity. The 
total recovery was 40% for occluded skin (of which 13.4% was found in the 
occlusion material) and 2.2% for non-occluded skin. The relatively low recovery was considered to be due to evaporation of ethanol. Evaporation tests revealed 
half-lives of evaporation ranging from 11.7 seconds for whole pig skin to 24.8 seconds for glass
74. 
The penetration of ethanol through full thickness guinea-pig skin has been 
studied without and with occlusion (par afilm, gel bound or a sealed chamber 
with a minimal air space) for an exposure period of 19 hours. V olumes of 25 to 
500μl of [14C] ethanol were applied to 5 cm2 non-occluded skin. Under occlu-
sive conditions 100 μl (approximately 16 mg/cm2) was applied. Skin penetration 
was determined by analyses of 14C in the saline receptor fluid. The percentages 
recovered in the receptor fluid were 0. 94, 0.38 and 0.29% for an initial applied 
dose (non-occlusion) of 50, 100 and 200 μl, respectively, leading to approxi-
mately comparable absolute amounts recovered. The results for the dose of 500μl were unreliable. Under occlusive conditions the percentages recovered in 
the receptor fluid were 8.1,  23.4 and 27.1% for occl usion with pa rafilm, gel 
bound and sealed chamber, respectively.  Peak penetrations were observed at 
approximately 3 hours for occlusion under parafilm, 14 hours for occlusion with gel bound and 18 hours for the sealed chamber. A significant loss of 24% was 
found when ethanol in saline was pumped through the experimental apparatus 
with the exception of the diffusion cells, indicating that the amount of ethanol in 
the effluent is an underestimation
77. Further, it is noted that the amount of etha-
nol present in the skin after 19 hours was not determined. This may have led to a 
further underestimation of the absorbed dose, although Pendlington et al.  
reported limited amounts of ethanol rema ining in the skin after 24 hours of 
exposure74. 54 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)From the above-mentioned studies it is difficult to derive a reliable estimate for 
dermal absorption of ethanol. The studie s differ in concentrations and dose per 
cm2 applied as well as exposure duration. Further, often only the amount of etha-
nol in the receptor effluent was determined. Due to the high evaporation rate of 
ethanol, a significant amount of the absorbed ethanol may be evaporated before 
analyses. An absorption percentage canno t be used for the evaluation of the 
applicability of a skin notation. The ab sorption percentage is dependent on the 
specific conditions of exposure and not applicable to other exposure conditions
78. Beskitt and Sun75 estimated that their exposure was under “infinite 
conditions” whereas Pendlington et al.74 observed a decrease in penetration rate 
after 2 hours. Further, the type of occlusion may also influence the absorption77 
which may explain the higher absorption rate found by Beskitt and Sun75.
As a worst case estimate (because th e experiment was performed under 
occlusion) the penetration rate of 0.67 mg/cm2/h calculated by Beskitt and Sun75 
can be used to calculate the internal dose after derm al exposure; a 25% aqueous 
solution of ethanol was used.
5.1.4 Concluding remarks
Inhalatory absorption of ethanol is relatively low, i.e. about 60%. It may be cal-
culated that if a working man uses 10 m3 of breath per working day at 1900     
mg/m3 (1,000 ppm), pulmonary intake (at an absorption efficiency of 60% will 
approximately be 11.4 g of ethanol. This corresponds to drinking a little over 1 
standard glass of an alcoholic beverage . These intakes correspond well to the low 
blood ethanol concentrations obser ved in the few studies performed.
Most (more than 90%) of the orally in gested ethanol is absorbed at a high 
rate. Ethanol dose and concentration have a direct and proportional effect on the blood alcohol concentration. The presence of food in th e stomach, rather than the 
type of food or the type of alcoholic beverage, is the most important factor 
decreasing blood alcohol co ncentrations, because the presence of food signifi-
cantly decreases gastric emptying. 
From in vitro  studies, the dermal absorption rate is assumed to be 0.67       
mg/cm
2/hr (worst case estimate).Kinetics 555.2 Distribution
5.2.1 Equilibration betw een blood and tissues
Once ethanol has been absorb ed into the bloodstream it is rapidly transported 
throughout the body and distributed over the total body water. During the initial absorption phase the arterial BAC is high er than the venous BAC, peaking at a 
higher level and requiring less time to reach the peak. After an arterial-venous 
equilibrium is reached, the venous BAC remains above the arterial BAC
79. Equi-
librium is reached about 1-1.5 hr after dr inking. This will occur sooner in organs 
highly perfused with blood (brain, lungs, kidneys, liver) than in other organs. It will take a relatively long ti me for this equilibrium to be  reached in inactive skel-
etal muscular tissue because of the poor perfusion of this tissue. Body fat and 
skeletal mass absorb hardly any ethanol.  Once the equilibrium has been reached 
the amount of ethanol in the organs will  be proportional to the organs' water con-
tent. Several studies in humans have confirmed this with great precision
73. 
Plasma and serum, which have virtually the same water content, had identical concentrations of ethanol. The plasma to  whole blood ratio of ethanol concentra-
tion is about 1.12. This could be predicted by the water contents of plasma (about 92%) and whole blood (about 80%). 
5.2.2 Volume of distribution: effects of gender and age
It has been clearly demonstrated that th e same dose of ethanol per unit of body 
weight produces widely differing blood ethanol concentrations in different indi-
viduals. The reason for such variability or iginates amongst othe rs from the large 
intra-individual variations in proportions  of body water and body fat. Because of 
the very low lipid to water partition coefficient of ethanol, the volume of distri-bution of ethanol in the body is equivalent to the total body water. 
On average, standard women have less body water per kilogram of body 
weight (500 ml/kg) as compared to standard men (600 ml/kg). Consequently, the 
same quantity of ethanol per kilogram body weight results in a higher BAC in a 
standard woman (body weight of 60 kg) than in standard men (body weight of 70 kg). In addition, the differences in BA C between men and women are even larger 
given a fixed dose of ethanol, because women have on average lower body weights than men do. The combination of the higher body weight with a higher proportion of body water in man results in an appreciably larger amount of body water over which the ethanol can be distributed in men. 56 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Goist and Sutker80 showed that women had higher maximal blood ethanol 
concentrations than men when they r eceived the same dose of ethanol in 
grammes per kilogram body weight, but maximal BAC did not differ between women and men when they received the sa me dose per litre of body water. Wat-
son et al.
81 also calculated that the differ ence between mean observed BAC and 
mean predicted BAC on the basis of the dose per kilogram body weight in both 
men and women disappeared when the dosage was corrected for total body 
water. It is unlikely that gender differ ences in ethanol toxicokinetics or ethanol-
induced performance impairment may be caused by the menstrual cycle and vari-ations in female sex hormones
82,83.
Ageing also plays an important role in determining the BAC by a given dose 
of ethanol. Jones and Neri84 found a substantial change of body water from 61% 
of body weight in healthy men aged 20-29 years to 54% in those aged 50-59 
years. This decrease accounted for a majo r part of the age-related difference in 
maximal BAC after the same oral dose of ethanol in grams per kilogram.
5.3 Biotransformation
Ethanol is metabolized in several steps (Fi gure 5.2): it is oxidi zed first to acetal-
dehyde. Acetaldehyde is a toxic substance held to be partly responsible for the harmful effects of excessive ethanol intake. Acetaldehyde is subsequently con-verted into acetate. Most of the acet ate is oxidized completely to CO
2 and H2O.

Although these fundamental pathways for ethanol metabolism are common 
to all human beings, the enzymes involved can take different forms – so-called isozymes – which result from the substitution of one or more amino acids in the polypeptide chain. The isozymes have different catalytic characteristics which 
accounts for individual variation in rate of ethanol metabolism.
The maximal amount of ethanol that can be transformed by the human body 
per hour is estimated in the range of 100-300 mg per kg per hour. This is usually translated into 6-9 g of ethanol per hour for a healthy subject. Considerable inter-
individual variations in ethanol metabolism rate have been reported
87. Both envi-
ronmental and genetic factors influence the rate of ethanol degradation, like 
gender and race (Table 5.2). Twin studies indicate that interindividual  variability 
in the rate of ethanol metabolism is under genetic control, a striking similarity in ethanol metabolic rate was observed in identical twins with much greater vari-
ability between fraternal twins

Three enzyme systems are known to catal yse the conversion of ethanol into ace-
taldehyde, which differ in  intracellular localization: 
1 alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), localised in the cytosol2 cytochrome P450 oxidizing system (or microsomal ethanol-oxiding system 
(MEOS)), localised in the endoplasmatic reticulum
3 catalase, localised in the peroxisomes.
The main reaction is the one through ADH. The other two enzyme systems do 
not seem to play an important part quantitatively, although it has not been estab-lished to what extent they exactly contribute to the process (Figure 5.1)
85. How-
ever, these routes may contribute to the toxic eff ects of ethanol. 
ADH-dependent reaction
Human alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, alc ohol:NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) 
is a zinc-containing enzyme  located almost exclusivel y in the cytosol of cells. 
The highest ADH concentrations (approxi mately 80-90% of the total ADH activ-
ity in human tissue) have been found in the liver. ADH activity has also been detected in other tissues, such  as the gut, kidneys and lungs.
For the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde catalyzed by ADH, oxidized nic-
otinamide adenine dinucleoti de (NAD+) is needed and NADH is produced in the 
cytosol. This results in an increased NADH/NAD ratio in the cytosol, with a 
marked shift in the redox potential
91.
NADH can be reoxidized to NAD+ in the cytosol by reducing other interme-
diates in metabolism. However, at high ethanol concentration this route can be saturated. In particular pyruvate is redu ced to lactate and oxaloacetate is reduced 
to malate. In addition, NADH and the reduced comp ounds accumulate in the 
cytoplasm, inhibiting gluconeogenesis and depressing the activity of the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) in the liver. Th e accumulation of lactate results in hyper-
lactacidemia, which can cause hyperuri caemia because lactate and urate share 
the same mechanism for renal tubular excretion
92.
Excess NADH may promote fatty acid sy nthesis. The increased NADH/NAD 
ratio raises the concentration of glycer ophosphate which favors hepatic triglycer-
ide accumulation by trapping fatty acids. Fatty acids of different sources can 
accumulate in the liver because of differ ent metabolic disturbances and because 
of decreased fatty acid oxidation85. Kinetics 59ADH has a low substrate specificity: it converts not only ethanol, but also 
other alcohols. ADH is not induced by chronic ethanol consumption.
Human ADH exhibits different molecular forms that have been grouped in 
classes (for reviews see:86,93). Human liver ADH exists in multiple molecular 
forms which arise from the association of  different types of subunits each of 
molecular weight of 40000 Da into active dimeric molecules. A genetic model 
accounts for this multiplicity  as products of seven lo ci (ADH1-ADH7) have been 
described94. Polymorphisms occur at 2 loci, ADH2 and ADH3, which encode the 
β- and γ-subunit. These classes differ from each  other in more than 30% of their 
amino acid sequence and exhibit distinct kinetic properties and specific tissue 
distribution.
Class I ADH is the classical liver enzyme . Class I is composed of isozymes con-
sisting of α, β, and γ subunits; encoded by the gene loci ADH1, ADH2, ADH3, 
respectively. These α, β, and γ subunits can associate w ith one another to form 
both homodimers and heterodimers. 
The ADH2 locus shows three alleles in the human population that encode for 
β1, β2 and β3 subunits. In the Caucasian population the β1 subunit is predomi-
nant. Individuals with β2 subunits represent less than 20% of Caucasians but 
more than 80% of Japanese and Chinese. Isozymes with β3 subunits are found in 
25% of African-Americans but were not detected in other populations. Genetic polymorphism also occurs in the ADH3 locus. The γ1 and γ2 subunits appear 
with about equal frequency in Caucasia ns, American and As ian Indians. The γ1 
subunit predominates to  about 90% over the γ2 subunit in the Asian and African-
American population
95. 
Class I isozymes are mostly localized in the liver, but se veral isozymes are 
also present in the gastrointestinal tract  (stomach, small and large intestine) and 
the kidney. Isozymes with ß subunits are detected in low amount in the digestive tract muscle layers but not in the mucosa . The gastrointestinal mucosa character-
istically contains subunits encoded by ADH3. Most of the class I isozymes, with 
the exception of β3 homodimers, show a low Km for ethanol (0.05 to 5 mM at 
pH 7).
Class II consists of only one form with π subunits, encoded by the ADH4 gene. It 
has been described in the liver but not in the gastrointestinal tract and exhibits a 
high Km for ethanol (Km=34 mM)
96.60 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Class III is formed by PP subunits encoded by ADH5. It is present in the liver 
and in the entire gastrointest inal tract. It exhibits a ve ry low activity with ethanol 
because it cannot be saturated by this su bstrate. It only contributes to ethanol 
metabolism at rather high ethanol concentrations. It shows the best kinetic con-
stants as a glutathione de pendent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, suggesting that 
the elimination of formaldehyde is the main physiological function of class III 
ADH97. 
Class IV ADH was initially described in the stomach mucosa98, consisting of a 
homodimer with σ subunits encoded by ADH7 (or ADH6 according to Jörnvall 
and Höög93). It has not been detected in the liver. The Km for ethanol of σσ-
ADH is high (37 mM at pH 7.5). It is especially specific for medium and long-
chain alcohols. It is predominantly locat ed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, 
mouth, oesophagus and stomach and represents a metabolic barrier to external alcohol and aldehydes. Individuals exhibiting σ-ADH in the stomach have a 
higher total ADH activity than those who do not. Ethnic differences in the expression of class IV ADH have been described. A high percentage of Asians lack class IV A DH in the stomach.
A functional new ADH gene, designated ADH6, has been characterized
99. Both 
liver and stomach from a Japanese ad ult female contained the ADH6 mRNA. In 
vitro translation produced a protein with kinetic properties similar to those of 
human class IV ADH. However, the a mino sequence identity is only 60% and 
therefore ADH6 represents a new class, designated class V ADH. As no class V 
ADH protein has been detect ed in either liver or stomach the metabolic signifi-
cance is not known. 
Recently a new gene (ADH8), represen ting class VI ADH, has been charac-
terized in deer-mouse and rat only. Little is known about the further distribution, but from class separation known to be likely in human, too
100. 
Cytochrome P450 oxidizing system  (Microsomal et hanol-oxidizing 
system)
Ethanol may also be oxidized by a cyto chrome P450 dependent enzyme system 
(CYP2E1) in the microsomes of the liver85, the so called microsomal ethanol-
oxidizing system (MEOS). This convers ion of ethanol to acetaldehyde needs 
NADPH and O2 (Figure 5.1). CYP2E1 has a much  higher Km value for ethanol 
(8-10 mM) as ADH, which means that CYP2E1 only converts ethanol at rela-Kinetics 61tively high blood ethanol concentrations. In this process, the superoxide anion 
can be formed.
Chronic ethanol consumption results in induction of the human cytochrome 
P450 2E1 isozyme in MEOS and thereby increasing the contribution of this enzyme to ethanol metabolism. This induction may be responsible for the meta-bolic tolerance to ethanol in alcoholics. In addition, alcoholics tend to display 
tolerance to various other drugs. Other microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes 
in the liver share many properties with MEOS, including utilization of cyto-chrome P450, NADPH and O
2. The induction of cytochrome P450 by ethanol 
consumption may increase the activity of these drug-metabolizing activities in the liver. This could, at least in part, e xplain the enhanced rate of drug clearance 
in vivo  after chronic ethanol consumption
85. The ethanol dose appears to be 
important, because induction may occur vi a two steps: a post- translational mech-
anism at low ethanol concentrations and an  additional transcriptional one at high 
ethanol levels101,102.
P450 2E1 has a high capacity of metabolizing ethanol, but also other ali-
phatic alcohols as well as a number of he patotoxic agents. It can be induced by 
various compounds such as acetone, pyrazole and benzene103. Respiratory nasal 
epithelium of humans contained, relative to liver, a low amount of cytochrome 
P450 and associated biotransformation act ivities, and a low level of other com-
ponents of the MEOS104. 
Catalase dependent reactions
The third pathway to convert ethanol into acetaldehyde is by means of catalase 
enzymes present in the peroxisomes of the liver (Figure 5.1). As early as 1936, Keilin and coworkers (see
105) pointed out that under certain conditions peroxida-
tion of ethanol might take place. The per oxide needed is generated by NADPH or 
hypoxanthine oxidation under the influence of oxidases106 or by β-oxidation of 
fatty acids such as octanoate, palmitate and oleate in peroxisomes107. The forma-
tion of H2O2 is considered to be the rate-limiting factor.
Some authors mention values of up to 25% for the extent to which catalase 
accounts for ethanol conversion107. However, under physiological conditions, 
catalase appears to play no major role85.62 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Role of acetaldehyde in the actions of ethanol
The contribution of acetaldehyde to the pathologi cal consequences of chronic 
ethanol intake is well established, for in stance for different fo rms of cancer in the 
digestive tract and the upper airways108. Acetaldehyde may play a role in other 
pathological consequences of ethanol abuse including alcoholic liver disease. 
Evidence suggests an important role of  acetaldehyde during acute intoxication 
causing ”alcohol sensitivity”, which is va sodilatation associat ed with increased 
skin temperature, subjectiv e feelings of hotness and facial flushing, increased 
heart and respiration rate, lowered bloo d pressure, sensation of dry mouth or 
throat associated with bronchoconstriction and allergy reactions, nausea and 
headache, and euphoria. The individual variability in these actions depends on 
the genetic polymorphisms for the metabolic enzymes involved108.
However, it is difficult to detect acetaldehyde in human blood samples even 
during intoxication109,110. Nevertheless, a number of reports on human blood ace-
taldehyde concentrations have been published, but these levels may be explained as artefacts, reconfirming  the findings that acetal dehyde concentrations are 
below detection, i.e. <0.5 
μM.
Acetaldehyde’s toxicity is, in  part, due to its capacity to form protein adducts, 
resulting in enzyme inactivation, antibody production and decreased DNA repair. Metabolism of acetaldehyde via xanthine oxidase or aldehyde oxidase may gen-
erate free radicals, but the concentration of acetaldehyde required is much too high for this mechanism to be of significance in vivo . However, acetaldehyde 
may promote lipid-peroxidat ion and free-radical medi ated toxicity via GSH 
depletion
85.
5.3.2 Conversion of acetaldehyde into acetate
During the second step in  the oxidation process the acetaldehyde generated is 
converted into acetate by the NAD-depe ndent enzyme acetaldehyde dehydroge-
nase (ALDH). Almost all other tissues also contain ALDH; but extrahepatic 
activity is low. 
ALDHs are involved in the detoxificat ion of ethanol-der ived acetaldehyde. 
They could play a role in the conversi on of aldehyde intermediates formed dur-
ing the metabolism of corticosteroids, amino acids, biogenic amines, retinoids, 
and products of lipid peroxidation86. 
Mammalian ALDHs have been grouped in different classes, based on their struc-
tural properties, subcellular localisation, and tissue distribution. Human class 1 Kinetics 63and class 2 ALDHs show 68% sequence identity, human class 3 ALDH shares 
only 35% sequence identity with class 1 or class 2 ALDH. In the human liver at 
least four different isozymes are describe d which differ in structural and func-
tional properties. ALDH2 is located in the mitoc hondria, the other ALDH 
isozymes in the cytosol86.
Class 1 ALDH (ALDH1) is represented by the tetrameric enzymes located in 
the cytosol and is found mainly in the liver but also in both the mucosa and mus-
cular layer of most gastrointestinal ti ssues. It has a low Km for acetaldehyde, i.e. 
50µM with a range of range 22 – 483 (amongst others Rashkovetsky et al.111) 
and theoretically could contribute to  acetaldehyde elimina tion when class 2 
ALDH is not present, although less ef ficiently than the class 2 enzyme.
Class 2 ALDH (ALDH2) includes the tetr americ forms located in the mito-
chondria. They are most abundant in the liver but expressed in many other 
organs. They are present in the stomach an d the intestine but barely detectable in 
the oesophagus. Class 2 ALDH has a very  low Km for acetaldehyde (Km 1 µM) 
with a range of <0.1 to 9 μM, which allows for efficient removal of this compo-
nent during ethanol consumption. 
Class 3 ALDH refers to the dimeric, cytosolic forms, constitutively 
expressed in stomach, esophagus, saliva,  gingiva, lung, cornea and to a much 
lesser extent, in liver. It is absent or expressed at very low levels in duodenum, 
jejunum, ileum and colon. Both stomach and cornea enzymes appear to be identi-
cal. Class 3 ALDH has been estimated to account for more than 80% of the 
ALDH activity, measured with a high concentration of aldehyde, in human gas-tric mucosa. Because of its high Km  value for acetaldehyde (Km 88 mM) how-
ever, class 3 ALDH contributes littl e to the elimination of acetaldehyde.
There appear to be interi ndividual differences in su bcellular distribution and 
amounts of high- and low-Km forms of ALDH in the liver
95. Caucasians have 
two active ALDH isozymes: ALDH1 and ALDH2. Many Asians (Mongoloids), about 30-50%, do have an atypical inactive form of ALDH2. The inactive ALDH2 form results in hi gher acetaldehyde levels in  the blood u pon ethanol 
consumption. These high acetal dehyde concentrations are considered as the main 
cause of the flushing syndrome, manife sting itself in facial flushing, cardiac 
arrhythmia, head ache and vomiting
112. This reactions are comparable with the 
reactions caused by disulfir am, an inhibitor of ALDH  (Antabuse-reaction). Con-
ceivably, impaired acetaldehy de metabolism could exacerbate the toxic effects of 
locally generated acetaldehyde. 64 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Several investigations have demonstrated that the ALDH2*2 allele substantially 
increases the risk for cancers almost throughout the digestive tract as well as can-cers in the upper airway tracts
108.
5.3.3 Conversion of acetate
Normally acetate is ox idized in the citric acid cycl e, after activation to acetyl-
coenzyme A, which is a metabolite central to the whole metabolism. However, the acetate formed in the liver after oxidati on of ethanol cannot be  oxidized in the 
citric acid cycle in the liver mitochondria , because of the prev ailing high ratio of 
NADH/NAD+ (see before). Consequently, most  of the acetate is released into the 
circulation and oxidized extrahepatically to CO
2 and H2O. A small portion of the 
acetate generated from ethanol is incorporated in tissue components by anabolic reactions. 
Normally the endogenous acetate leve ls are rather lo w (0.1-0.3 mM). 
A moderate dose of ethanol can temporar ily increase the circulation concentra-
tions of acetate to 0.4 to 0.6 mM
113. 
There is a high correlation between the rate of ethanol elimination and the 
blood acetate concentrat ion. In alcoholics with an el evated rate of ethanol elimi-
nation, the acetate concentra tion in both the hepatic vein and peripheral veins is 
higher than in controls. 
The higher blood acetate levels in alcoholics may have consequences for the 
heart and the liver, because acetate interf eres with lipid metabolism and is the 
preferred substrate over glucos e and lipids in the myocardium114.
5.3.4 Alternative pathways for ethanol metabolism
When the oxidizing abilities  of ADH and ALDH isoenzymes are saturated, the 
normal metabolic pathways of ethanol may be diverted to a variety of other path-
ways. The relative importance of the al ternate metabolic processes is probably 
determined by the dose and the duration of ethanol consumption. Alternative pathways for ethanol metabolism contribute to the increased xenobiotic toxicity and carcinogenicity in alcoholics. 
A non-oxidative pathway of ethanol metabolism to form fatty acid ethyl 
esters has been proposed
115. Acutely intoxicated subject s, had concentrations of 
fatty acid ethyl esters that were significan tly higher than in controls. The reaction 
is catalyzed by fatty acid ester synthase, which is found primarily in brain, pan-creas and heart. Fatty acid ethyl esters ma y have a role in the production of etha-Kinetics 65nol-induced injury in these organs. The cap acity of ethanol to form ethyl esters in 
vivo has been shown116-118. 
As already described, chronic ethanol ingestion may increase the amount of 
human cytochrome P450 IIE isoenzyme an d thereby increase th e contribution of 
this enzyme to ethanol oxidation85. The oxidizing system of cytochrome P450 
has the potential to generate molecules known as free radicals, which cause tis-
sue injury by inactivation of enzymes and peroxidation of lipids. In addition eth-
anol inhibits the synthesis of reduced glutathione (GSH), a scavenger of toxic free radicals.
5.3.5 Elimination by first-pass metabolism 
Studies in human subjects and rats have shown that under certain conditions 
intravenous administration of a low dose of ethanol results in appreciably higher blood ethanol concentrations than the oral intake of the same amount of ethanol does. This may mean that part of the ingested ethanol has been metabolized 
before reaching the peripheral blood, becau se absorption of ethanol from the gas-
trointestinal is virtually complete. This part of the metabolism is called first pass 
metabolism and can theoretically occur in liver, stomach or intestines.
Because of the high amount of ethanol metabolising enzymes in the liver, the 
liver will be the main organ for ethanol metabolism.
There are several lines of evidence that the stomach contributes in first pass 
metabolism of ethanol as well. Firstly, in gastrectomised patients, blood ethanol 
concentrations were approximately the sa me after oral intake and after intrave-
nous infusion of ethanol. In healthy men, intraduodenal infusion of ethanol resulted in significant higher blood ethanol concentrations than normal oral intake of ethanol, which also suggests that bypassing the stomach diminishes first pass metabolism
119. 
Secondly, as described before, several isozymes of alcohol dehydrogenase 
are present in the stomach, with  e.g. Japanese exhibiting lower σ-ADH activity 
than Caucasians, with no difference in th e other gastric enzyme s. In keeping with 
this, first pass metabolism was strikingly lower after the intake of a 5% ethanol solution in Japanese than in Caucasians
120. Frezza et al.121, reported that the 
activity of stomach ADH was lower in wo men as compared to men. Other stud-
ies, however, showed that gastric ADH act ivity was not significantly different 
between men and women98 or differed only significantly below the age of 50 
years122,123. So, the relation between gastric ADH activity and gender differences 
in first pass metabolism is not very consistent. 66 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Although there is some evid ence for first pass metabolism to occur in the mucosa 
of the stomach, the contribution of first pass metabolism to the metabolism of ethanol is still a matter of dispute. 
Suggestions for the contribution of first pass metabolism to the total ethanol 
metabolism vary from 1 to 20%, depending on conditions used in the studies
124. 
A randomized cross-over study using concomitant administration of unla-
beled and deuterium-labeled ethanol thr ough two different routes (intravenous/
oral and intravenous/introduodenal) showed that drinking a moderate dose of ethanol (0.3 g/kg) after a light lunch total first pass metabolism was about 9% and gastric first pass metabolism about 6% without significant differences in men and women
125. 
When first pass metabolism is extrapolated from in vitro  data, its contribution 
to overall ethanol metabolism is rather small, 1% or less98. Parés and Farés86 cal-
culated that a human stomach of 150 g, assumed to contain 50 g mucosa, will metabolize about 0.9 mg ethanol/minute. This corresponds to approximately 1% 
of the hepatic activity. Extrapolation of in vitro  data to the in vivo  situation, how-
ever, is difficult. 
Faster or slower gastric emptying can  increase or decrease the area under the 
curve (AUC)
70. Differences in AUCs measured  may have been influenced by 
differences between the input rate of ethanol in the portal vein and the systemic circulation
126,127,125.
In a later paper, a two-compartment mo del was applied that accounts for the 
fall in ethanol concentration that may o ccur as blood traverses the liver. This 
two-compartment model predicts that n ear-complete saturation will occur more 
abruptly and at a lower blood ethanol c oncentration (approx. 3 mM) than is the 
case with the one compartment model. The two compartment model predicts a 
near constant ethanol elimination rate for blood ethanol concentrations above 3 mM, whereas the one compartment model pr edicts an increasing elimination rate 
over a large range of con centrations. The two-compartment model also predicts 
that first-pass metabolism is extremely sens itive to the rate of ethanol absorption. 
When absorption was slowed by food ingestion, first pass metabolism accounts 
for about 50% and 10% of ethanol dosag es of 0.15 g/kg and 0.3 g/kg, respec-
tively. When ingested without food, there is negligible first-pass metabolism of 
even very small dosages (0.15 g/kg). The authors conclude that first-pass metab-
olism is an unimportant determinant of the blood ethanol response to ingestion of potentially inebriating doses of ethanol
128. This means that results based on com-
parisons of AUCs after different routes of administration should be interpreted 
with care. Kinetics 67The role of first pass metabolism after inhalatory exposure is, however, less 
relevant.
5.4 Elimination (excretion)
Only a small proportion of ethanol is ex creted with urine, breath, breast milk, 
sweat and tears. Practically  all ethanol is eliminated from the body by oxidation 
via various enzyme systems to CO2 and H2O. Generally speaking: 90-98% is oxi-
dized, 1-5% is excreted via the lungs by ex piration, and 1-3% is excreted via the 
other routes, like urine (0.5- 2.0%) and sweat (up to 0.5%)73. 
5.4.1 Pulmonary excretion
The total amount of ethanol lost from th e body via breath is small, usually less 
than 5%. Ethanol diffuses readily from the pulmonary arterial blood into the 
alveolar air. In principle, ethanol vapor in  the breath is in equilibrium with etha-
nol dissolved in the water of the blood. This equilibrium is expressed as a parti-
tion coefficient with a co mmonly cited average value of 2100 to 1 for blood-to-
pure alveolar air. This coefficient, i.e. 2100 ml of breath contains as much etha-
nol as 1 ml of blood in equilibrium, may be used to estimate BAC from the breath measurement. The pro cess is the basis of the well-known breath analyzer 
tests for estimating BAC. 
Gullberg
129 analysed series of simultaneous blood and breath measurements 
in the literature and observed a skewed distribution with a modal value of about 
2200 to 1 and a geometrical mean of about 2300 to 1. The range of distribution observed was wide, however, it ranged from 1700 to 3500. Among other reasons this is caused by the phase in the true  BAC curve at which the breath measure-
ments are made. In healthy human subjects, the apparent coefficient was 2130 +
 
150 during the rising phase, 2260 +  120 at the peak and 2340 +  190 in the 
descending phase of the curve130. Large variation may result from hyperventila-
tion or hypoventilation resulting in disequilibria between alveolar air and blood. Nevertheless, breath measurements give a good approximation of the true BAC, even in routine police use
131. 
5.4.2 Urinary excretion 
Theoretically, ethanol will app ear in the glomerular filt rate at the same concen-
tration as in the water of the blood at the time that the filtrate is being formed in the kidney. In experiments in humans, when capillary blood samples were taken 68 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)at the same time as hourly pooled bladder urine, the urine-to-blood ethanol ratio 
varied with the phase of the BAC curve. The ethanol concentration in blood was 
higher than in urine during the ascending phase of the BAC curve, whereas the ethanol concentration in blood was lower than in urine during the descending phase of the BAC curve
132. 
5.4.3 Elimination by other body fluids and secretions
Ethanol appears in the tears in a concentr ation proportional to the water content 
of the lachrymal fluid133. When the fluid on the conjunctival surface is exposed 
to air, ethanol partitions between the fluid and the air, just as it does in the alveoli 
of the lung. Sweat also cont ains ethanol in proportion to its water content. The 
saliva ethanol level is shown to be closely correlated with those in blood and breath
134. Breast milk of nursing mothers cont ains ethanol at levels comparable 
to the corresponding blood samples after ethanol ingestion135.
5.5 Summary and evaluation
Only limited data are available concerni ng the kinetics of inhalatory intake of 
ethanol. Inhalatory absorption of ethanol by the lungs is relatively low, i.e. about 
60%. Physical activity will increase inhalatory absorpti on. It is expected that 
inhaled ethanol will be metabolized by the liver mainly. 
There are no data available with a dir ect comparison of the blood ethanol 
concentrations after oral or inhalatory ethanol exposure. However, high concen-
tration of ethanol vapours are needed to reach detectable blood ethanol concen-
trations in humans; for example, inhalatory exposure to 1900 mg/m3 for 4 hours 
results in a maximal blood ethanol concentration of approximately 2 mg/l. In comparison, (oral) ethanol consumption (~20 gram) results in BAC
max of 
approximately 300 mg/l in social drinking. In addition, Sprung et al.  measured a 
blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in man due to endogenously present ethanol of 0.27 mg/l
19. The blood alcohol concentration is a highly dynamic parameter, 
e.g. under social drinking conditions (10-30 g of ethanol per day), blood alcohol concentration will peak during the first hour and after several hours no ethanol will be detectable. This is in contrast with the blood alcoho l concentration after 
inhalatory exposure, which is constant during the exposure. 
Data on acetaldehyde pharmacokinetics af ter inhalatory and oral exposure 
are scarce, because the analysis of this  metabolite is difficult and the acetalde-
hyde concentration in human blood is low.Kinetics 69Most data concerning the ethanol kinetics are based on oral intake of alco-
holic beverages. The presence of food in the stomach, rather than the type of 
food or the type of alcoholic beverage, is the most important factor for the bio-
availability of ethanol, because the presen ce of food significantly decreases gas-
tric emptying. Most (more than 90%) of the orally ingested ethanol is absorbed at 
a high rate. After absorption, ethanol will pass the liver first before it will reach 
the general circulation. The significance of first pass metabolism in the liver, 
stomach and intestines is debated and considered of minor relevance.
Dose and concentrations of ethanol in air or drinks do have a direct and pro-
portional effect on the blood ethanol concentration. The (maximal) blood ethanol concentration will depend on several factor s, like gender, age and genetic predis-
position. Genetic predisposition plays a role because many isoenzymes and poly-
morphisms exist in ethanol metabolising enzymes, which result in different 
metabolic rates between racial and ethni c groups on the one hand and individuals 
on the other. Overall, ma ny different ethanol metabolizing enzyme systems exist 
which result in a large ethanol eliminati on capacity. A healthy subject is consid-
ered to eliminate between 6 an d 9 g of pure ethanol per hour.
Dermal absorption is difficult to esti mate. As a worst case (experiments were 
performed under occlusion) estimate the penetration rate of 0.7 mg/cm
2/h can be 
used to calculate the internal  dose after dermal exposure.70 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Effects in man 716 Chapter
Effects in man
6.1 Irritation and sensitisation
Inhalation studies in humans indicate that ethanol causes concentration-related 
irritation of the mucous membranes (Table  6.1). The odour threshold is ~95    
mg/m3 (50 ppm; from graph) for a 1-3 seconds exposure to ethanol, while after 
this short exposure period eye irritation  was reported by subjects at approxi-
mately 95,000 mg/m3 (50,000 ppm; read from graph). In this study, both eye irri-
tation and odour thresholds were measured in a two-alternative, forced-choice procedure in which subjects had to choose the stronger of two stimuli, one being blank, until the participant got five correct  choices of the same concentration step 
in a row. The latter concentra tion was taken as the threshold
13. 
No adverse effects on well being (rat ed on a 7 points scale comprising ten-
sion, tiredness, complaints, and annoyance)  were (self)reported by 16 subjects, 
experimentally exposed for 4 hours to cons tant ethanol air concentrations of 150 
mg/m3 (80 ppm), 750 mg/m3 (400 ppm) or 1,500 mg/m3 (800 ppm) in an inhala-
tion chamber52,136. A 4-hour exposure to 1,900 mg/m3 (1,000 ppm) had no 
adverse effect either. In  contrast, an average co ncentration of 1,900 mg/m3 
(1,000 ppm) for 4 hour, resulting from hourly changing levels of either 190/
3,610/190/3,610 mg/m3 or 3,610/190/3,610/190 mg/m3 was characterised as 
‘unpleasant’ by the volunteer s. Increasing the concentrat ion directly from 0 or 
190 to 3,610 mg/m3 caused temporary irritation. The female subjects gave a 72 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)stronger response than the males52,136. Symptoms included tickling in the throat; 
irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin; blurred vision; unpleasant taste and discomfort
52.
Thirty minutes of exposure to ethanol in a concentration of 3,420-3,800 mg/m3 
(1,800 to 2,000 ppm) causes coughing, dry throat and temporary bronchial

that the irritation increases with the con centration, causing coughing, stinging in

and fatigue starting from 4,750-6,346 mg/m3 (2,500-3,340 ppm). In contrast, 
Mason and coworkers did not report subjective symptoms of intoxication after exposure to 17,000 mg/m
3 ethanol for almost 3 hours139. Also, Kruhøffer45 
reported only a feeling of warmth in the upper throat while inhaling 14 g/m3 
(7,368 ppm) for 1 hr. Since the Loewy and V on der Heide study was published back in 1918, an d several more recent studies report  no effects in this range, this 
study will not be taken into consideration.
The ACGIH concluded that no local irritation will occur below 5,000 mg/m
3 
(2,650 ppm) ai r concentration8. Levels over 21,280 ppm (40,432 mg/m3) are suf-
focating and unendurable53. If the subjects are exerci sing, adverse effects are 
observed at lower levels than at rest, due to the increased ventilation rate141.
In concentrated form (not fu rther specified), ethanol is very irritating to the eyes 
and causes temporary damage to  the conjunc tiva and cornea141. A 40-50% aque-
ous solution applied to the eye induces reversible lesions and hyperaemia142. 
Human subjects who had 95% ethanol applied for 24 h under an occlusive patch 
to the forearm in a modified Draize test did not experience any form of irritation 
after 24 and 72 hrs. This was also true  for a 21-day open skin exposure test, 
where 0.02 ml 95% ethanol was applied to the lower back every 24 hrs. Exposure 
under identical conditions with occlusion caused erythema and induration (thick-
ening/hardening of the skin) in the two test subjects towards the end of the test period
143. Ethanol (50% aqueous solution) was shown to be a weak sensitiser in a 
24-hr occluded skin patch test, causing allergic contact dermatitis in rechallenges of sensitive individuals
144. 93 subjects were exposed three times a week for three 
weeks, resulting in mild to severe skin irritations. During a rechallenge 17 days later, irritation was evident in 15 cases. Additional challenges provoked allergic 
response in 6 subjects
144. Repeated skin exposure can cause irritation and dry 
skin due to defatting141, and lead to irritant dermatitis142. 
Ethanol can produce subjective irritation, irritant contact dermatitis and non-
immunologic urticaria145-148. The prevalence of occurrences is low. The cause is 
often occupational exposure, with the possi bility of cross-reac tion with other pri-
mary alcohols and aldehydes144,145. 74 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Ethanol-induced bronchial asthma (a trigger of or worsening of asthma by etha-
nol consumption) is so far only observed in Asians. It has been connected to increasing acetaldehyde levels in the blood often seen in Asians with a geneti-cally determined variation in ethanol metabolism
149,150. Hooper151 reported a 
reduction in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) by 20-40% in two patients with 
mild asthma inhaling nebulised ethanol (10%, 100 μl and 20%, 250 μl).
6.2 Toxicity due to acute and short-term exposure
Acute ethanol intoxication is related to the Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). 
The BAC is proportional to the air concentration of ethanol and to the rate of 
ventilation, and inversely proportional to the weight of the subject51,53,139,140 (see 
Table 6.1). 
In an effort to assess the effects of low doses and gender, 16 volunteers were 
exposed to low doses via inhalation. In th e first series subject s were exposed for 
4 hrs to constant ethanol air concentrations of 150 mg/m3 (80 ppm), 750 mg/m3 
(400 ppm) or 1500 mg/m3 (800 ppm) in an inhalation chamber. The second test 
series also lasted 4 hrs, but the conc entration changed ever y 60 minutes, either 
increasing from 190 mg/m3 (100 ppm) to 3,610 mg/m3 (1900 ppm), or decreas-
ing from 3,610 mg/m3 to 190 mg/m3. The hourly changing levels were either 
190/3,610/190/3,610 mg/m3 or 3,610/190/3,610/190 mg/m3. Subjects were 
tested during and after the experiments for changes in physical wellbeing or dis-comfort, reaction time and mental perf ormance, in accordance with the Swedish 
Performance Evaluation System. A 4-hr exposure to 1,900 mg/m
3 (1,000 ppm) 
had no adverse systemic or local eff ect, whereas increasin g the concentration 
from 190 to 3,610 mg/m3 caused temporary irritation52,136. No significant expo-
sure-related effects were evident in th e psychological performance variables in 
either study. There were no sign ificant gender sp ecific differences52.
It is unsure whether ethanol alone cause s the symptoms observed at concentra-
tions of ~2622-6346 mg/m3 (~1380-3340 ppm) by Loewy and von der Heide138. 
The study was published in 1918, and se veral more recent studies report no 
effects in this range141. Likewise, although the study performed by Lester and 
Greenberg53 is widely quoted, the results will not be taken in to consideration as 
the reported endogenous BAC (9-27 mg/l) is much higher compared to the obser-vations of Sprung et al.
19. For the reasons indi cated above, others1,4,54 have also 
questioned the validity of the results of Loewy and von der Heide138 and Lester 
and Greenberg53. Effects in man 75Some of the adverse effects of ethanol have been ascribed to its metabolites, 
mainly acetaldehyde. It is uncertain whether vasodilation of blood vessels in the skin, lower blood pressure, higher hear t rate, nausea and headache, actions nor-
mally denoted ‘alcohol sensitivity’, are caused in part or completely by increased acetaldehyde levels in the blood
108.
The central nervous system (CNS) can be affected at BACs from 200-300 mg/l, 
according to the DFG1, while another source sets the lower limit for CNS effects 
like reduced reaction time at BAC 500  mg/l for non-tolerant individuals12. The 
majority will be clearly influenced at 600-700 mg/l, and a BAC of 1.5-3 g/l is characterised by moderate in toxication with an increasing muscular incoordina-
tion; slowed reaction time; sensory lo ss and slurred speech. A BAC increasing 
from 3 to 5 g/l causes double vision, vomiting and stupor, leading to coma, respi-
ratory depression, hypotension and hypothermia; with a lethal BAC >4 g/l (4‰) when death occurs by resp iratory/circul atory failure
1,12. However, highly con-
centrated ethanol vapou rs need to be inhaled to r each detectable blood ethanol 
concentrations (~tens of mg/l); To compar e, oral ethanol consumption can result 
in a maximal BAC of up to 1000 mg/l in social drinking (see also chapter 5).
6.3 Case reports
There have been reports of percutaneous intoxication in young individuals with 
damaged skin and pre-term infants with poorly keratinised skin152. A 63-year-old 
man had suffered more than 40 years from erythema from sites of topical appli-
cation of ethanol and palpitations and genera l flushing from oral intake of etha-
nol. He reacted to patch testing of ethanol (83%, 10%) at 15 minutes with 
transient erythema, and eczem a at 2 and 3 days. Due to frequent blood collection, 
the patient was exposed to ethanol on cotton wool routinely sealed tightly over the point of vene-puncture. The author presumed that ethanol had, over time, 
progressed from causing non-immunologic urticaria to inducing 
hypersensitivity
147. However, the observed patch test reactions may also be 
explained by a non-immunologic mechanism.
6.4 Summary of short-term effects after inhalatory exposure to ethanol
Based on the available data in table 6.1, DECOS derives a NOAEL of 1900    
mg/m3 for acute and/or short-term exposure. DECOS concludes that inhalatory 
exposure for one hour to concentrations at or below 1,900 mg/m3 ethanol (1000 
ppm) will probably not cause local irrita tion or systemic eff ects. Concentrations 76 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)above 3000 mg/m3 (for 30 minutes) might result in minimal effects as transient 
cough, dry throat, tickling in the nose et c. A sudden increase in ethanol concen-
tration (from 0 or 190 to 3,610 mg/m3) may cause temporary irritation, whereas a 
concentration of 17,000 mg/m3 ethanol is described as ‘intolerable’ for unaccli-
matized persons.
In concentrated form, ethanol is very irritating to the ey es. Non-occlusive, 
repeated dermal exposure to 95% ethanol does not cause skin irritation, but may 
cause dry skin due to defatting. Occl usive contact, in contrast, may induce 
erythema and induration (thickening/hardening of the skin). Also irritant contact dermatitis and non-immunologic urticaria ha ve been reported after ethanol expo-
sure. Based on available human experience, ethanol is not considered a skin or 
respiratory allergen. 
6.5 Long-term effects based on epidemiological studies
6.5.1 Introduction
Selection of the literatureNo human data are available on the effect s of long-term inhalatory exposure to 
ethanol. 
Human data on the effects of chronic consumption of alcohol beverages, 
however, are numerous. As most of the lo ng-term health effect s of oral ethanol 
exposure are attributed to systemic expos ure via the blood stream, which is also 
the destination of inhaled ethanol, stud ies on orally consumed ethanol are also 
suitable to assess potential health effects of ethanol exposure by inhalation as far 
as these effects can be attrib uted to systemic exposure. 
As the number of studies available on lo ng-term health effect s of oral alcohol 
consumption is enormous, only a selection of all publications will be discussed 
in this section. The foll owing approach was chosen to evaluate the relation 
between oral alcohol consumption and long- term health effects. Evaluations by 
four (inter)national bodies are chosen as starting point  for the following reasons: 
(1) they were written by a number of internationally respected scientists, (2) the description and evaluation of the epidemio logical studies was, with some excep-
tions, adequate and balanced, and (3) they  were relatively recent. The selected 
reviews are those by the Inter-Departme ntal Working Group on Sensible Drink-
ing of the UK Department of Health
3, by the International Life Science Institute 
(ILSI)2, and, for reprotoxic effects only, by the Health Council of the 
Netherlands6. Effects in man 77For the UK report a substantial amount  of evidence was reviewed by the 
Group, for some health eff ects (cancer and reprotoxic effects) by a specific com-
mittee. The aim of  the review was to establish leve ls of intake associated with a 
beneficial effect and those associated w ith adverse effects on  health. The refer-
ences were also evaluated for methodolog ical quality and efforts were made to 
achieve consistency in the evaluation by external reviews and consultation of 
external experts. 
For the ILSI report, published in 1999, nine panels were composed of scien-
tists from different disciplines and asked to address the relationship between alcohol consumption and one of the follo wing areas: moderate drinking, assess-
ment of intake, genetics, body weight, the cardiovascular system, pregnancy, 
breast cancer, bone, and the central nervou s system. Also included as appendices 
to this book are two not updated chapters from the first edition (from 1992), 
Alcohol and Liver Diseases and Cancer s of the Digestive Tract and Larynx. 
Some topics involving the neuropathological consequences of alcohol use, such as the psychiatric effects of  alcohol abuse and injuries from drinking and driving, 
were not addressed. A disadvantage of the ILSI report is that the panels worked 
independently from each other and did not  always apply the same criteria for 
evaluating the epidemiolo gic evidence for different health effects. 
In addition, the committee us ed the review by Anderson et al.
153, as this 
review, although concise, followed a well-structured and transparent approach for the selection and evaluation of 156 papers derived from 131 studies. Articles were included in this latter review if they  contained: (a) a qu antitative measure of 
individual alcohol consumption; and (b) a measure of individual risk outcome 
related to consumption. 
To assess dose-response differences be tween men and women, the review by 
Bradley et al.  was used
154. 
As the focus of the current report is to re trieve the levels of exposure to etha-
nol that may cause adverse health effects,  the reviews were screened for informa-
tion on dose-response asso ciations. Where appropriate, the original publications 
were consulted. The selected reviews we re updated with the results from recent 
studies, provided that these were sufficiently large to achieve statistical stability 
and investigated a dose-re sponse association between  alcohol consumption and 
health outcome. Estimates of dose-response associations will be mainly based on cohort studies, if available,  as case-control studies on  self-reported alcohol con-
sumption may be subject to recall and selection bias. 
Single studies, also those that can be c onsidered as adequate studies, are sub-
ject to statistical fluctuat ion and possible small biases. Therefore, the “weight of 78 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)the evidence” is optimally represented th rough (good) meta-a nalyses and – pref-
erably – pooling studies. While a meta-a nalysis summarises the published results 
of presumably all eligible studies, a poo ling study conducts a (re)analysis of the 
combined original data from a number of studies. In general, pooling studies have greater possibilities to estimate do se-response associations; a drawback is, 
however, that usually not all eligible datasets can be obtained. 
If a man uses 10 m
3 of breath per work shift of 8 hours and the pulmonary intake 
(at an absorption efficiency) is 60% (see ch apter 5), it can be calculated that after 
inhalatory exposure to 1900 mg/m3 (1000 ppm) ethanol the total amount of inter-
nal ethanol increases 11,4 g. This corres ponds to drinking a little over 1 standard 
glass of an alcoholic beverage, assuming 10  g per glass. Therefore, the focus is 
on the health effects that  may occur after daily consumption between zero and   
2-3 glasses per day, and not on those effects that are known to occur in heavy drinkers or alcohol abusers. 
Light to moderate levels of alcohol consumption have been associated with 
reduced risks of several diseases, in part icular coronary heart disease (CHD), but 
also peripheral arterial disease,  ischaemic stroke, and gallstones
2,3,153. Since 
DECOS focuses on prevention of the adverse effects, these beneficial effects are 
not taken into account.
Exposure assessmentFor the purpose of the current report, onl y studies are reviewed that quantitated 
alcohol consumption. Studies using classifications, such as drinkers versus non-
drinkers or light, moderate, and heavy dr inkers without indication of the amount 
consumed, were excluded. In  the reviewed epidemiologi cal studies, oral alcohol 
consumption was usually measured by means of a self-administered question-naire (sometimes interview), in which in formation was collected on the current 
(or recent past) frequency of consumptio n and the type and amount of beverages 
consumed weekly. Only few studies collected information on the lifetime drink-
ing history or, for that matter, information on past drinking. The implicit assump-
tion with measuring current (or recent pa st) alcohol consumption is that it is 
representative for the drinking habits since adulthood. In reality drinking habits are, of course, not exactly similar over lifetime, but the change over time is only 
very gradual. For example, Goldbohm et al.  conducted a reproducibility study on 
a food frequency questionnaire repeated annually during five years
155. The corre-
lation for the test-retest reproducibility of alcohol intake was 0.90, while the cor-Effects in man 79relation coefficient decreased to 0.82 after a five-year interval. This is still a very 
high correlation, indicating that alcohol drinking is a rather stable habit. This is, of course, not true for subjects, usually high consumers, who stopped completely because of medical advice or other reasons  and could therefore be classified as 
past drinkers. This latter group can bias  the dose-response association if they 
cannot be distinguished from the never-drinkers. In contrast, replacing lifetime 
alcohol consumption with current consumption or recent past consumption 
results in slight attenuation (underestima tion of the dose-response association). 
The validity of self-reported alcohol consumption has been subject of much dis-cussion. Generally, the finding is that alcohol consumption is under-reported, in particular among high consumers
156. Underreporting would result in overestima-
tion of the health effects for a given amount of alcohol157. Since we cannot 
assume that the degree of underreporting is similar for all alcohol consumers, it 
is difficult to infer a true dose-response association from an observed dose-response association. 
In most studies, alcohol consumption is expressed as the average amount 
consumed per day or week, leaving the pattern of alcohol consumption out of consideration. To make the average am ount of alcohol consumed comparable 
between the different studies the intake is recalculated to gr ams of ethanol per 
day [g/day], where necessary . Internationally, differen t standard sizes are used 
for the amount of ethanol in one glass or drink (e.g., 12 g in the USA; 10 g in the Netherlands) and the amount of ethanol in one unit (8 g in the UK). In this report, recalculated intake levels are put in square  brackets [ ]. Intake  levels originating 
from the publications are put between round brackets ( ). It should, however, be 
kept in mind that oral alcohol intake is a discrete parameter (a multiple of units) 
rather than a continuous parameter. Apart from the total dose per week or day, the drinking pattern might also be of gr eat importance. Some effects are thought 
to be associated to the total dose (AUC) while others are thought to be associated with the blood-alcohol concentration, which is dependent on the consumption pattern. Unfortunately, information on the drinking pattern, e.g. binge drinking versus regular daily drinking was often not collected in the studi es. If available, 
information on the influence of the drinking pattern on each effect will be dis-
cussed. 
Finally, for the same level of alcohol consumption, the internal dose is 
approximately 50% higher for women than for men, due to differences in body weight and amount of body water per kilogram of bodyweight (see paragraph 5.2.2). This should be ta ken into account when compar ing the results from the 
epidemiological studies among women and men. Methods other than question-80 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)naires or interviews to assess alcohol intake were not encountered in the epide-
miological studies.
Other methodological considerationsEpidemiological studies on health effects of exposure to oral alcohol may be sub-
ject to selection bias, occurring if cases with a particular disease are not compara-
ble to those without the disease, and in formation bias. Both types of bias are 
more difficult to exclude in case-contro l studies, in which subjects are recruited 
and exposure is assessed after they beco me a case, than in prospective cohort 
studies, in which cases arise after asse ssment of exposure. For this reason, we 
consider cohort studies superior to cas e-control studies and base dose-response 
associations mainly on cohort studies.
An epidemiological study may also be biased due to confounding by another 
risk factor for the health outcome than th e exposure in question (alcohol). To be 
an actual confounder, such a risk factor mu st be associated with the exposure of 
interest. Depending on the health effect, different sets of confounders are of 
importance to take into account in the de sign and data analysis of a study. For 
example, in studies on the effect of expo sure to ethanol on birth weight and car-
diovascular disease, consideration of and,  if necessary, adjustment for smoking is 
very important. Without such consideration, a study is worthless since in general people who drink (more) alcohol also te nd to smoke (more) and this could result 
in an incorrect attribution of the effects of smoking to alcohol consumption. In general, recent cohort studi es (published after 1990) take confounding factors 
much better into account and use appropriate multivariate adjustment strategies. 
Several methodological issues that were still hampering proper evaluation of a 
(causal) dose-response association ten years ago, have now been settled
3.
6.5.2 All cause mortality
The UK Inter-departmental Working Group on Sensible drinking confirmed that 
the relationship between all-cause mortality and alcohol consumption follows a J-shaped curve. Non-drinkers have higher all-cause mortality than light and mod-erate drinkers, and heavy drinkers have even higher all-cause mortality than either group. The Group attempted to esta blish a dose of alcohol at which the rel-
ative risk of death increases steadily an d significantly, but favoured a band of 
minimal mortality associated  with consumption between 7 and 28 units per week 
[8-32 g/day] for men. The Group emphasised, however, that this conclusion does not imply that this level of alcohol consumption is entirely risk free. The Inter-Effects in man 81departmental Group concluded that drinking alcohol confers a significant health 
benefit in terms of reduced CHD mortality and morbidity on men aged over 40 and postmenopausal women. In terms of all causes of mortality and morbidity, the benefit can be largely gained by drinking as little as 1 unit/day [8g/d] on a regular basis. Consumption above 2 units/day [16 g/d] does not confer any major additional health benefit. Men who drink >3 or 4 units/day [>24-32g/day] and 
women who drink >2 or 3 units/day [16-24 g/day] had an increasing statistically 
significant risk of illness and death from a number of conditions, including haemorrhagic stroke, some cancers, acci dents, and hypertension. The relevant 
recommendations of the Gr oup are the following: 
• “Men: Regular consumption of be tween 3 and 4 units a da y [24-32 g/day] by men of all ages will 
not accrue significant health risk ; consistently drinking 4 or more units a day [>32 g/day] is not 
advised as a sensible drinking level because of the progressive health risk it carries.
• Women (non pregnant): Regular consumption of between 2 and 3 units a day [16-24 g/day] by 
women of all ages will not accrue significant hea lth risk; consistently dr inking 3 or more units a 
day [>24 g/day] is not advised as a sensible drinki ng level because of the progressive health risk 
it carries.”
In a meta-analysis, published in 1996, of  16 cohort studies on alcohol consump-
tion and all-cause mortality, al so a J-shape curve was observed158. The cohort 
studies were conducted in the USA (10), UK (2), Puerto Rico (1), Finland (2), and Sweden (1); in four of the studies, ex-drinkers were excluded. The lowest 
mortality was achieved at a consumption of 0-9 g per day for women and 10-19  g per day for men. From these minimum risk  levels, the risk increased faster for 
women than for men at the same dose levels. For women, the RR was signifi-
cantly increased at a consum ption level of 20-29 g/day compared to abstainers 
(RR 1.13, 95% CI, 1.10-1.16), whereas for men the RR was significantly increased at a consumption level of 40-49 g/day (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.10). The meta-analysis also included a larger number of non-identified and not fur-ther described studies (cohort and case-control) that looked at other alcohol-related endpoints. At consumption levels considered as “responsible” ( i.e. <20  
g/day for women and < 40 g/day for men), the relative risks for alcohol-related 
cancers and liver cirrhosis co mpared to abstainers were statistically significantly 
increased, whereas those for ischaemic hear t disease, stroke and cholelithiasis 
were significantly decreased
158. 
An important prospective cohort study not yet included in the latter review nor in 
the meta-analysis, was the study by Thun et al.  (American Cancer Society Study 82 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)II) among 490,000 US men and women (mean age 56 years; range 30 to 104), 
who reported their alcohol  and tobacco use in 1982159. During the next nine years 
of follow-up, 46,000 of them died. In this study, histories of current and past alcohol and tob acco consumption were assessed in  detail, subjects with missing 
data on amount or duration of alcohol or  tobacco use as well as past drinkers 
were excluded, and the analyses were adju sted for age, race, education, smoking, 
body-mass index and several other pote ntial confounders. Total mortality 
appeared to be lowest at a consumption of one alcoholic drink per day [12 g/day] for men as well as women, but in women the rate of increase of the risk at a 
higher consumption level was larger than in men. Despite the lowest mortality at one drink per day, some causes of death we re already slightly more prevalent at 
this consumption level as compared to non drinkers: liver cirrhosis and alcohol-
related cancers (but not colorectal) in me n and liver cirrhosis and breast cancer in 
women. For liver cirrhosis, the increased risks for one drink per day were not sta-
tistically significant.
Several authors stressed that the J-shaped  curve trading off beneficial effects 
against adverse effects of alcohol on mortality is to be expected only in popula-tions where cardiovascular disease mortalit y is high and, for the same reason, 
among the middle-aged only. Available ev idence indicates that  minimal mortal-
ity in young people does occur among the non drinkers
160.
6.5.3 Cardiovascular effects 
The ILSI report, reviewed the available scientific (epidemiologic) evidence (197 
references) for the following conditions : coronary heart disease (CHD), lipids, 
haemostasis, atherosclerosis, blood pres sure, insulin sensitivity, and (different 
types) of stroke161. 
Coronary heart disease
The ILSI report reviewed the evidence fr om case-control and cohort studies sep-
arately. More than 50 cohort studies have been published up to 1998 (the date of 
the report). Twelve of them, which were al l large to very large, provided detailed 
information on the quantity of alcohol consumed, and were able to adjust for age and smoking (besides other variables), were included in a table; several others were also discussed in the text. The twelve studies were conducted in Japan (2x), 
China (1x), USA (6x), UK (1x), Denmark (1x), and France (1x). Length of fol-
low-up varied from 2 to 19 years, but was for most of the studies between 7 and 15 years. In most of the studies, the endpoint was CHD mortality, with exception Effects in man 83of the studies by Klatsky et al.  among almost 129,000 pa rticipants in a Health 
Maintenance Organisation (Kaiser Permanente)162, a relatively small study (n = 
6788 men and women) by Rehm et al.163, and the study by Camargo et al.164, all 
conducted in the USA, and the Japanese study by Kitamura et al.165. These latter 
studies had incident CHD (or myocardial infarction) as endpoint. The authors of the review concluded that most of the studies reviewed showed remarkable con-
sistency, even across diverse populations
161. There appears to be a U-shape rela-
tionship between alcohol dose and CHD. The level at which the right side of the U for fatal and non-fetal CHD begins to increase could not be identified exactly and appears to be somewhere between 2 and 6 drinks/day [20-60 g/day]
161. For 
women, less data are available than for men. However, the cohort studies con-ducted among women in the USA by Rehm et al.  , Thun et al.  (American Cancer 
Society Study II) , Fuchs et al.  (Nurses’ Health Study), and Klatsky et al.  (Kaiser 
Permanente Study) all showed protective ef fects of alcohol at consumption levels 
below 48 g/day
159,162,163,166. Heavy drinkers (> 80 g/day) have an increased risk 
of CHD. Although vascular disease takes a long time to develop it is not known how long alcohol needs to be consumed in order to have an effect on reducing the manifestation of vascular disease
3,161. 
Part of the protective effect  of alcohol against coronary disease is believed to 
be a long-term effect mediated through in creased levels of high density lipopro-
tein (HDL) cholesterol and decreased le vels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) 
and therefore inhibiting the formation of coronary artery atheroma3,160,161. 
Another mechanism of the pr otective effect of alcohol against coronary heart dis-
ease may be due to effects on  blood clotting, a short-term  effect that appears to 
last only about 24 hours after alcohol intake3,160,161. 
Regular consumption of small amounts of alcohol is more protective than the 
same amount taken in larger doses less frequently161. This may be due to both 
harmful effects of sporadic heavy drinking and the short-term nature of some protective effects, particularly those involving blood clotting
3. 
Hypertension
Epidemiological studies provide strong su pport for the view that alcohol use is 
an important factor in raising the bloo d pressure and that a causal association 
exists between the use of > 30-60 g/d and blood pressure elevation in men and 
women161. Several large cohort studies have suggested that the risk of hyperten-
sion is increased in women who drink as few as 2 drinks a day [20 g/day] with 
recent intake being more im portant than average intake154. A single episode of 84 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)heavy drinking can lead to an increase in  blood pressure for the succeeding 3 to 4 
days160. In some studies the relationship between alcohol intake and blood pres-
sure has been reported to be linear; in others, a threshold effect was apparent at around two or three standard drinks per day [20-30 g/day]
160. Assuming a linear 
relationship with no threshold an add itional drink a day (10 g) would increase 
both systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 1-2 mm Hg3,153. A generally 
accepted clinical view would be that for me n the rise in blood pressure produced 
by 4 units a day [32 g/day] (about 6 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and 4 mmHg 
diastolic) would give rise for concern 3. 
Stroke
Most epidemiological studies suggest that regular light to moderate alcohol 
intake (2-4 units a day) [16-32 g/day] probably reduces the risk of ischeamic 
stroke. However, regular alcohol consumption of more than 40 g/day and binge drinking may increase the ri sk of haemorrhagic  stroke (due to cerebral or sub-
arachnoid haemorrhage). Binge drinking or acute intoxication might also be associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke. H eavy alcohol consump-
tion is associated with both ischaemic and hemorrhagic stroke
3,161. Positive as 
well as U-shaped dose-response relationships between alcohol consumption and all strokes were reported by Anderson. When data were analysed according to 
type of stroke, only subarachnoid haemorrhage showed a consistent dose-response relationship
153. The UK Inter-Departmental Working Group did not 
consider it possible to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the relationship of 
alcohol to all forms of st roke, as consumption levels, pre-existing hypertension, 
age and sex are all si gnificant variables3. However, guidelines adopted in the 
USA and UK suggest that individuals may achieve some benefit if daily con-sumption is limited to 2-3 drinks [10-30 g/day]
161.
6.5.4 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
The results of several epidemiological st udies have indicated that the risk of 
developing Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is lower in moder-ate drinkers (15-40 g/day) than in abstainers
3,160.
6.5.5 Gallstones
Several epidemiological studies indicate that the consumption of alcoholic bev-
erages is associated with a redu ced risk of cholesterol gallstones160. It appears Effects in man 85that an alcoholic consumption of up to 40 g/day in men and up to at least 15       
g/day in women may inhibit the formation of cholesterol type gallstones3. 
6.5.6 Liver toxicity
There is no doub t that alcohol abuse results in liver damage and ultimately liver 
cirrhosis and death due to cirrhosis. Re versible conditions, such as steatosis 
(fatty liver) and alcoholic hepatitis, prec ede the occurrence of irreversible cirrho-
sis and are presumably causally related to it167. The question at what level of 
alcohol consumption liver damage may occur is much more difficult to answer. 
First, liver damage as such can hardly be assessed in epidemiological studies, 
except in a screening setting. For this reason, most studies focused on the most serious manifestations of liver damage, i.e., cirrhosis as cause of death and diag-
nosis at hospitalisation. S econdly, the majority of studies were case-control stud-
ies for which the retrospective assessment of alcohol consumption and the possibility of selection bias posed a pr oblem, as explained previously. Prospec-
tive cohort studies on alcohol consumption and liver cirrhosis were, however, 
conducted in a few instances. The older cohort studies had very limited statistical 
power due to the relatively small study sizes
168. However, several well-con-
ducted, well-analysed, and large cohort studies were published more recently
159,169,170. An overview of these studies is  presented in Table 6.2. The 
American studies were conducted among pa rticipants in the Kaiser Permanente 
Medical Care Program169 and by the American Cancer Society159. The Danish 
study was a pooling study of several cohort studies from Copenhagen, among 
which the Copenhagen City Heart Study (follow-up 21 years) contributed more than half of the person years; this latter study was also analysed before
170. The 
study by Klatsky et al.  was rather small, but exclud ed past drinkers and studied 
death due to liver cirrhosis. The study by Thun et al.  is the largest conducted to 
date and also included death due to al coholic psychosis and dependence as end-
point (15% of all cases), together with liver cirrhosis. Past drinkers and subjects 
with missing data on the quantity of alcohol consumed were excluded. Becker et 
al. not only studied death, but also hospitalisation due to liver cirrhosis. They 
were not able to exclude past drinkers, however, and attempted to deal with this problem by taking subject who drank between 1 and 7 drinks per week as refer-ence group.86 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)The results of the three cohort studies ar e presented in Table 6.3. All Relative 
Risks (RRs) in the table above 1.5 were statistically significant. Despite the dif-
ferences between the studies in the cate gorisation of alcohol consumption, it was 
possible to compare the relative risks for different levels of alcohol consumption across the studies (Table 6.3). In fact, th e magnitude of the RRs appeared to be 
quite comparable. A consumption of twelve grams of alcohol per day did not seem to increase the risk of  liver cirrhosis to a very large extent, but above that 
level an increase of the risk wa s apparent. The study by Klatsky et al.  differed 
from the other studies in observing a substantially increased risk at a level of 18 g 
per day, whereas the other two found less increased risks at the higher consump-tion level of 30 g per day. While it is plausible that all three studies overestimate the RRs somewhat due to underreporting of their alcohol consumption, it is likely that such an effect was stronger in the study by Klatsy et al. , as the partici-
pants of the study were members of an health insurance organisation and their 
data on alcohol consumption were obtain ed in the context of  a health examina-Table 6.2   Characteristics of large cohort studies on al cohol consumption and liver  disease (cirrhosis).

(4.5-45)-Effects in man 87tion. In the study by Becker et al.  the high RR in the male non-drinker category 
supports the notion that the non-drinker group apparently contained past (heavy) drinkers, who contaminated the non-drinker group, in particular among men. It is not clear from any of the studies that wo men run a consistently higher risk than 
men for a given level of alcohol consumption.
In conclusion, liver cirrhosis is the irreve rsible and very serious (usually fatal) 
end stage of a disease process of the live r, which can be adequately assessed in 
epidemiological studies. Less serious damage to the liver (e.g. fatty liver and alcoholic hepatitis) can only be assessed in a screening setting and we have no knowledge of such studies. Two effects have to be balanced in evaluating the effect of alcohol consumption on liver toxicity: on one hand liver damage may 
have been underestimated as only the most serious endpoint was assessed, but at 
the other hand underreporting of alcohol consumption may have resulted in over-estimation of the dose-response associatio n. The net result is unknown, but from 
a more practical approach, it seems sensible  to conclude that a consumption level 
up to 12 g per day is relatively safe, whereas higher doses may carry a risk of liver damage for some people. Based on the epidemiological data of good qual-
ity, there is no reason to set different limits for women than for men. 
6.5.7 Cancer
Numerous epidemiological studies were conducted on the association between 
(oral) alcohol consumption and the risk of  a large number of cancers. For several 
cancers a likely causal association has been established. These cancers are: 
• Oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx cancer• Oesophageal cancer, notably the squamous cell type• Hepatocellular cancer• Colorectal cancer
• Breast cancer.
Cancers at the first two sites show a rather strong association with alcohol con-
sumption, in particular in combination with cigarette smoking. The last three types of cancer show weaker, but quite consistent associa tions with alcohol 
consumption
171. 
Whereas it seems plausible that the upper aerodigestive tract cancers are 
caused by direct contact between the al cohol and the epithelium lining the tract 
in the presence of strong carcinogens fr om cigarette smoke, cancers at the other 
sites can only be caused through a system ic effect of alcohol. Hence, the aerodi-88 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)gestive tract cancers may possibly be cau sed by combined exposure to several 
substances and not by ethanol itself, and ma y further be specific for the oral route 
of exposure. For these reasons, the effect of alcohol in causing  aerodigestive tract 
cancers is not relevant for the evaluation of cancers due to inhalation of ethanol 
and therefore not further discussed. 
In the area of alcohol consumption and ri sk of cancer, a considerable number of 
meta-analyses and several pooling studies were conducted. This review will be mainly based on these studies, supplemented with single studies when these are more recent than a meta-analysis or shed more light on a part icular characteristic.
In 1988, IARC concluded that adequate evidence in humans exists to show that 
drinking of ethanol is causally related to malignant liver tumours
172. Further-
more, IARC was of the opinion that malignant tumors of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and oesophagus are causally related to the consumption of ethanol as well. With respect to breast cancer, IARC was of  the opinion that “The modest eleva-
tion in relative risk that has been observe d is potentially impo rtant because of the 
high incidence of breast cancer in many countries. Although the available data 
indicate a positive association between drinking of alcoholic beverages and 
breast cancer in women, a fi rm conclusion about a causal relationship cannot be 
made at present
*.” 
Hepatocellular cancer
There is little doubt that liver cancer can be caused by alcohol consumption, 
besides other, stronger factors (Hepatitis  B and C infection, aflatoxin exposure), 
which modify each other’s effects173,174. A number of studies were conducted, 
many of them from Asia. Most of these studies focussed on hepatitis infection and aflatoxin exposure and not primarily on alcohol consumption. The studies that focussed on alcohol, did mostly not take into account the association with 
the other three, much stronger risk factors.  One of the few studies that assessed in 
a prospective design the antigen status of hepatitis B and antibody status of hepa-
titis C viruses and, at the same time, al cohol consumption and cigarette smoking, 
found some evidence of an independent ef fect of alcohol, but a much stronger 
effect in the presence of hepatitis infection
175. However, this study was very 
* In 2003, IARC placed alcohol beverages on the Priority List of agents and exposu res to consider in future IARC 
Monographs  because of new info rmation concerning ad ditional cancer sites ( breast , liver, colorectal cancer) and 
better knowledge of mechanisms of action.Effects in man 89small. In general, the committee has to conclude that far too little information is 
available to assess a dose-r esponse association for alcohol, independent from the 
other risk factors. Moreover, although ther e is still some debate, the majority of 
cases of liver cancer occur as a consequence of liver cirrhosis3. For this reason, 
combined with the lack of accurate data, the committee considers it not useful to 
try to assess quantitatively the effect of  alcohol on liver cancer , as liver cirrhosis 
probably is the more sensitive, serious health outcome.
Colorectal cancerThere is considerable evidence on the association between alcohol consumption 
and the risk of colon and rectal cancer. Often, a positive association is observed, 
although there are in consistencies between the stud ies. One, not very recent, 
meta-analysis by Longnecker et al.
176 is available in the literature. Furthermore, 
a pooling study is to be published, which covered eight large cohort studies, none of them included in the meta-analysis, i.e. the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-carotene 
Cancer Prevention Study (men), the Canadian National Breast Screening Study 
(women), the Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study (men), the Iowa Women’s 
Health Study (women), the Netherlands Cohort Study (men and women), the 
New York State Cohort (men and women) , the Nurses’ Health Study (women), 
and the Swedish Mammography Cohort (women). The 1990 meta-analysis including 27 studies observed in a linear  association a RR of 1.10 (95% confi-
dence interval (CI), 1.05-1.14) for two drinks per day (equivalent to approxi-
mately 24 g/day)
176. The included cohort studies (n=5), however, observed a RR 
of 1.32 (CI, 1.16-151) for the same amount of alcohol. The association did not 
vary according to gender and site within  the large bowel. The pooling study, 
including almost half a million subject s and 4687 cases of colorectal cancer, 
observed an increased risk fr om a consumption of 30 g/day177. For the categories 
of 30-45 g/day and > 45g/day compared with non-drinkers, confounder-adjusted RRs of 1.16 (95%CI: 0. 99-1.37) and 1.42 (95%CI 1.17-1.73) were observed 
respectively. The dose-response associat ion was also assessed by applying spline 
regression. Spline regression is a meth od to model a dose-response association 
without prior assumptions about the shap e of the curve. The spline regression 
curve appeared to be slightly J-shaped: alcohol consumers drinking less than 12 g/day had a RR slightly below 1. No differences were observed between man and women. Not all of the pooled cohorts were  able to separate past-drinkers from 
non-drinkers. However, for the studies that could, a subanalysis showed that all 
RRs were a little higher, but the conclusion about the dose-response association 90 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)was not changed. The pooling study did not observe heterogeneity for gender nor 
for type of alcoholic beverage and it is therefore concluded that  alcohol itself has 
the effect on colorectal cancer risk. 
A case-control study nested in a cohort study by Murata et al.178 in Japan, 
which was not included in the Pooling study, observed odds ratios (comparable to relative risks) of 3.5, 1.9, and 3.2 for alcohol intakes of 27, 54, and 81 g alco-
hol respectively as compared to abstainers.
The Health Professionals’ Study demonstrated that subgroups with a methyl-
group-deficient diet ( i.e. low in folate and methionine) may experience a stronger 
effect from alcohol. To date, an insufficient number of studies were conducted to substantiate this effect
179.
Breast cancer
The evidence on alcohol consumption and breast cancer in women is very ade-
quately summarised in a recent meta-analysis180, a study based on the pooled 
data from six prospective cohort studies181 and a very recen t pooling study 
including 53 cohort and case-control studies, coveri ng 58515 breast cancer cases 
and 95067 controls and representing 80% of all data available on this subject 
world-wide182. 
The study pooling the six cohort studies, included 322 647 women from the 
US (three studies), Canada, Sweden and th e Netherlands. 4335 cases of invasive 
breast cancer were detected among them181. In all studies, alcohol consumption 
was assessed at baseline ( i.e. before the occurrence of  the cancer) by a self-
administered food frequency questionna ire. The dose-response association was 
assessed by categorising alcohol consumption and also by applying spline regression. The relative risk (RR) appeared to be linear ly related to alcohol con-
sumption up to 60 g per day. Above this level, the relative risk did not appear to increase further, although this conclusion was based on limited data. Between a mean daily consumption of 0 and 60 g per day, the relative risk appeared to increase linearly with 9% for each 10 g of  alcohol (RR, 1.09; CI, 1.04-1.13). The 
heterogeneity between the six studies was not statistically significant. No differ-
ences in effects were observed between types of alcoholic beverages consumed.
The meta-analysis considered 74 publications, but included only 42 in the 
analysis. The major reasons for excluding st udies were the lack of quantifiable 
alcohol consumption data or duplicate data
180. The analysis comprised 13 cohort 
studies (including those comprised in the Pooling Study181), the remainder were 
case-control studies. Altogether 41,477 cas es of breast cancer were included. The Effects in man 91relative risk increased monotonically with alcohol consumption; 12 g alcohol per 
day corresponded with a RR of 1.10 (CI, 1.06-1.14). The 13 cohort studies found the same pooled estimate. Older stud ies (published before 1990) observed a 
slightly higher pooled RR (1 .12) than more recent ones (1.08) and studies within 
the United States a lower pooled RR (1.07)  than those that were conducted out-
side the United States, i.e. mainly Europe (RR, 1.13). No difference was 
observed for post- and premenopausal  breast cancer. No differences were 
observed for different types of alcoholic beverages. 
The most recent and largest pooling study also observed an almost linear 
dose-response association and estimated an  (confounder-adjusted) increased risk 
of 7.1% overall for every 10 g alcohol consumption
182. For the pooled case-con-
trol studies this figure was 7.4% (popul ation controls) and 7.3% (hospital con-
trols). For the pooled cohort studies, an increased risk of 5.0% was observed for 
every 10 g alcohol. This estimate was lower than the one made in the other pool-ing study of cohorts (9%)
181, although the included cohorts were the same in both 
studies with exception of the addition to the most recent pooling study of two 
large studies (American Cancer Society,  USA and Million Women Study, UK), 
which even showed a stronger dose-respo nse association than the other cohort 
studies. Although it is not clear what caused the different estimates, it may be 
due to different analytic methodology.
Almost no information is available on  the association be tween drinking pat-
tern and breast cancer relative risk. In ot her words, in the studies referred to 
above, for a given amount of mean daily alcohol consumption a relatively low regular consumption was not distinguished from less frequent, but high con-
sumption. The authors of another meta -analysis on alcohol and breast cancer, 
who observed that the relative risk was hi gher in Mediterranean  countries than in 
Northern Europe and North-America for the same amount of alcohol, suggested 
that this effect might be attributed to a daily drinking pattern as opposed to a 
more binge-drinking pattern, respectively
171. This effect can, however, also be 
attributed to the fact that all these studies in Mediterranean countries (mainly Italy), were hospital-based case-control studies. The pooling study, however, did 
not confirm that the studies from Mediterranean countries found higher risks
182.
Furthermore, there are only  a few data concerning the relation between drink-
ing alcohol and the risk for breast cancer in men. The risk for male breast cancer 
is inconsistently reported. Male breast cancer is rare. A recent European popula-
tion-based case-control study183 found that the relative risk of breast cancer in 
men is comparable to that in women for alcohol intakes below 60 grams per day. 
However, these data needs to be confirmed in other studies.92 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Summarising the data on br east cancer, the following  can be concluded. Due 
to the large number of available studies on alcohol and risk of breast cancer in 
women, which were summarised in high quality pooling and meta-analysis stud-ies, it is possible to establish a RR for women with a narrow confidence interval 
per unit of oral alcohol intake from a dose-response curve that is apparently lin-ear up to 30 g/day or higher; at high intake the relative risk seems to level off or 
even decrease
180,184. Some authors doubt whether su ch a weak association at the 
lower range of exposure can be considered causal185, although the consistency of 
the association certainly supports causality.
Differences in susceptibility
Several subgroups of people may be more susceptible for the cancer-enhancing 
effect of alcohol than the population at large. The first group constitutes those 
with a polymorphism, a genotype with (a) variant allele(s) that influences the metabolism of ethanol or its metabolites. The last decade research has been con-
ducted to see which polymorphisms are of  substantial importance. The most fre-
quently investigated in relation to alcohol metabolism is the alcohol 
dehydrogenase 3 polymorphism. Alcohol dehydrogenase 3 (ADH3) metabolises 
alcohol to acetaldehyde, a carcinogen. Two studies on breast cancer found dis-
cordant results
186,187; only the study by Freudenheim et al.186 observed an 
increased risk for subjects with the A DH3(1-1) genotype. The same was true for 
two studies on head and neck cancer: Harty et al.  observed an increased risk for 
subjects with the ADH3(1-1) genotype188, whereas Olshan et al.  did not189. A 
study on upper aerodigestive  tract cancer did not observe a difference between 
the different genotypes190. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 polymorphisms were also 
studied to some extent. It is obviously too early to draw any firm conclusions with respect to the importance of alcohol metabolising polymorphisms in the susceptibility of humans to the carcinogenic effect of alcohol.
Other susceptible subgroups may be those with a bad nutritional status, such 
as observed by Giovannucci et al.
179. In such subgroups, the effect of alcohol 
may be increased several-fold, but more research is needed to substantiate this 
effect.
Carcinogenicity of acetaldehydeIn 1999, IARC concluded that there is inadequate evidence in humans for the 
carcinogenicity  of acetaldehyde but there is sufficient evidence in experimental Effects in man 93animals for the carcinogenicity  of acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde causes gene 
mutations in bacteria and gene mutations , sister chromatid exchanges, micronu-
clei and aneuploidy in cultured mammalian cells, without metabolic activation
191. Based on the evaluation of IA RC, the committee concludes that 
acetaldehyde is a genotoxic carcin ogen in experimental animals. 
Conclusions regarding carcinogenicity
For several human cancers for which there is sufficient evidence that they are 
caused by exposure to ethanol, it is po ssible to derive a dose-response associa-
tion. Oral cavity cancer, pharynx and la rynx cancer and oesophageal cancer are 
assumed to be less relevant after inhalatory exposure. Alcohol consumption can 
cause liver cancer as well, and the committ ee is of the opinion that liver cirrhoses 
precede the liver cancer. 
For colorectal cancer, a clear dose response relationship is observed and 
assumed to be the same for both genders (Table 6.4). In addition, an increased risk for breast cancer caused by drinki ng alcohol has been demonstrated in 
women. No data concerning the develo pment of breast cancer in man are avail-
able. 
Another issue might be important with  respect to exposure to alcohol via 
inhalation. The aetiology of oesopha gus and larynx cancer has shown very 
clearly how alcohol, probab ly as co-carcinogen, inte racts with carcinogens to 
cause cancer. It is not implausible that inhaled alcohol causes the same sort of 
interaction, but then in the lungs. This may have an especially large impact on 
smokers, but also non-smokers are continuously exposed to small amounts of 
carcinogens from the environment. It is, however, very difficult to estimate the effect of this exposure.

There are no data available on the eff ects on human reproduction after inhalation 
of ethanol. However, based on epidemio logical data on the effects of ethanol 
consumption in the form of alcoholic beverages, the Health Council’s Committee for Compounds Toxic to Reproduction recommended classification of ethanol in category 1 for its ef fects on fertility ( substances known to impair fertility in 
humans ) as well as for its effects on  the development of offspring ( substances 
known to cause development al toxicity in humans ), according to the Directive 
93/21/EEC
5. 
For the description of the ef fects of ethanol on fertility, development and lacta-
tion, DECOS used a recent review of a co mmittee of the Health Council of the 
Netherlands (20046), hereafter referred to as  the Committee on Alcohol con-
sumption and reproduction as a basis. In this report the effects of moderate alco-hol consumption on human fertility, development and lactation were evaluated. 
The conclusions of this committee are summarised below. For detailed informa-
tion on individual studies, DECOS refers to the original report. 
FertilityIn 2004, the Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction evaluated the 
effects of moderate alcohol consumption on male and female fertility. Based on a 
study by Jensen et al.
192 (female fertility), a study by Tolstrup et al.193 (female 
fertility), by Eggert et al.194 (female fertility), and by Hassan et al.195 (male fertil-
ity), the committee concluded that a dose-effect relationship for the consumption of alcohol and effects on male  and female fertility exists. The committee is of the 
opinion that there are indications that consumption of less than 10 gram of etha-
nol per day might decrease female fertility (eg time to pregnancy). For effects on 
male fertility, only one study is available in which effects on fertility are described. Based on this study of Hassan et al.
195, the committee concluded that 
there are indications that consumption of  less than 10 gram of ethanol per day 
might decrease the male fertility as well.  
Spontaneous abortion and foetal death
The Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction evaluated the effects 
of moderate alcohol consumption before  (by man and women) and during preg-Effects in man 95nancy on spontaneous abortion and foetal death. The committee concluded that it 
is possible that drinking alcoholic be verages might increase the incidence of 
spontaneous abortion and foetal death. Several human studies by Armstrong et 
al. Harlap et al. , Kesmodel et al. , Windham et al. , Kline et al.  and Rasch et al.  
demonstrated this effect in pregnant women drinking an average of 10 grams of ethanol per day or more
196-203. Drinking less than 10 grams of ethanol per day 
also revealed these effects in some stud ies. However, these data are less consis-
tent. 
Pre-term delivery and length of gestationConsumption of alcoholic beverages du ring pregnancy might increase the inci-
dence of preterm delivery (birth before 37 weeks of pregnanc y) and decrease the 
length of the gestation. This was concluded by the Committee on Alcohol con-sumption and reproduction. Several cohort studies by Kesmodel et al. , Lunds-
berg et al. , Sulaiman et al.  and Parazzine et al.  show an increased incidence of 
pre-term delivery and shorter gestational le ngth after drinking more than 17 gram 
of ethanol
204-207. It has been suggested that this effect is predominantly related to 
consumption of alcohol in the second and third trimester of pregnancy205,206,208. 
The cohort study by Lundsberg et al.  also found effects on pre-term delivery and 
gestation length after drinking 1 to 8 grams of ethanol per day206. This is, how-
ever, not confirmed in the other studies.  
FAS and anomalies
The definition of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which was first described 
more than 20 years ago209, has been repeatedly discussed. One of the points of 
discussion is whether or not the diagno sis should include the criteria chronic 
alcoholism of the mother. However, as supported by several evaluations, the full spectrum of physical and mental handicaps of FAS is only seen in offspring of female heavy drinkers. Whether the i ndividual anomalies characterising FAS 
may be the result of a lower exposure to alcohol is not clear. The diagnosis of 
FAS is made if signs of the following th ree categories are present: growth retar-
dation, central nervous system involvem ent (neurological abnormalities, devel-
opment delay, intellectual impairment, low head circumference (lowest tertile)) and facial dysmorphology (short palpebra l fissures, elongated midface, flattened 
maxilla). Further, non-specific malformations in heart, limbs and kidney may 96 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)occur. When only some of the above sign s are present, the te rm Foetal Alcohol 
Effect (FAE) is used210.
The Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction concluded that the 
risk for FAS increased after longterm co nsumption of 90 grams (or more) of eth-
anol per day. There are no convincing indications that consumption levels lower than 60 grams ethanol per day might incr ease the incidence of individual anoma-
lies.
Birth weight, size and growthTo the most studied reprotoxic effects of  ethanol belong the effects on birth 
weight, size, and growth. Th ese effects also belong to  the spectrum of adverse 
effects characteristic to the FAS. 
The Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction concluded that the 
human data concerning the effects of dr inking alcohol on foetal growth are not 
consistent. The studies of Whitehead et al. , Passaro et al. , Ogston et al.  and Mar-
bury et al.  suggest a relation between alcohol consumption and decreased foetal 
growth and birth weight
211-214. The Committee of Alcohol consumption and 
reproduction is of the opinion that there ar e no clear indications  that drinking   
10-20 grams of ethanol per day might affect foetal growth and birth weight. There are, however, sufficient indications  that drinking more than 20 grams of 
ethanol per day might increase the risk for this effect.  
Foetal behaviour 
In 2004, the Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction concluded 
that acute oral exposure to 12-30 grams of  ethanol per day in the third trimester 
of pregnancy suppresses the human foetal breathing movements
215-218. This 
effect is observed during the first two hours after consumption. In addition, there are indications in one study of Little et al.  that the consumption of 1-10 grams of 
ethanol per day might affect the foetal startle behaviour
219,220. 
Neurobehavioral effects
The Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction concluded that the 
exposure to alcohol in utero, has an adve rse effect on the mental development of 
the offspring. A meta-analysis performed by Testa et al.  confirmed that prenatal 
exposure to more than 12 grams of ethanol per day will result in a lower mental Effects in man 97development index in one year old children221. This effect was not observed in 
younger and older children. Two large cohort studies (from Seatle and from Detroit) showed that maternal alcohol consumption (5 grams per day or more) during pregnancy has an adverse effect on the behaviour of 6-7 year old children
222-239. Therefore, the Committee on Al cohol consumption and reproduc-
tion concluded that it is not sufficiently investigated whether consumption of     
1-10 grams of ethanol per day will influe nce the neurobehaviour of children but 
effects are confirmed at higher consumption levels.   
LactationIn their report, the Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction 
described several controlled human studies of Mennella et al.
240-243. Based on 
these studies, the committee concluded that maternal consumption of 15-20 grams of ethanol, results in  a reduction (21-23%) of br east milk consumption by 
babies during the next three hours. Effect s at lower alcohol consumptions are not 
described. In addition, Mennella et al.  studied effects of breast milk containing 
ethanol on the rapid eye movement of infants
244,245. The Committee on Alcohol 
consumption and reproduction concluded th at the normal sleeping pattern can be 
disturbed after drinking breast milk of mothers who consumed 15-20 grams of 
ethanol. 
The former committ ee concluded that there ar e no convincing data that 
maternal alcohol consumption has an adve rse effect on the neurobehaviour of 
children after breast feeding246. The effects of lower consumption levels have not 
been studied.  
Overall conclusion with respect to alcohol consumption and reproduction
The Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction concludes that there 
is evidence that an intake of less than  10 grams of ethanol (one alcoholic con-
sumption) per day has an adverse effect on reproduction (decreased male and 
female fertility, increased incidence of spontaneous abortion, foetal death, pre-
term delivery, decreased length of gestation). 
6.5.9 Conclusion regarding the effects after longterm exposure
A very precise threshold for adverse affects of alcohol consumption on longterm 
health effects is difficult to establish due to variation between study results but also for methodological reasons. As far as the methodological reasons are con-98 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)cerned, DECOS acknowledges that underr eporting overestimates the quantitative 
dose-response associations, but this effect is likely to be lower in the low expo-sure range of interest to this report. 
In non-pregnant women, the most critical  adverse effect of exposure to etha-
nol is the increased lifetime risk of br east cancer (7-10 per 1 000 women) at every 
10 g of ethanol consumption per day. Other adverse health effects in women as 
well as men may occur at levels starting from 10 to 20 g oral ethanol consump-
tion per day. These adverse health effect s comprise increased risk on colon can-
cer, liver cirrhosis an d hypertension. With respect to the effects on reproduction, 
the Health Council’s Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction con-cluded that the available data show that  after consuming less that 10 grams of 
ethanol per day, adverse effects on human fertility and development might be 
expected.
6.6 Summary and evaluation
Only a couple of human studies on short-term dermal and inhalatory exposure 
are available. Based on the available studies DECOS is of the opinion that inha-
lation for one hour of concentrations less than 1900 mg/m3 ethanol (1000 ppm) 
will probably not cause local or systemic effects after acute and/or short-term 
exposure. However, a sudden increase in  ethanol concentration may cause tem-
porary irritation, whereas a concentration of 17,000 mg/m3 ethanol is described 
as ‘intolerable’ for unacclimatized persons.
Concentrated ethanol solution is very ir ritating to the eyes. Non-occlusive, 
repeated dermal exposure to 95% ethanol does not cause skin irritation, but may cause dry skin due to defatting. Occl usive contact, in contrast, may induce 
erythema and induration (thickening/hardening of the skin). Also irritant contact dermatitis and non-immunologic urticaria ha ve been reported after ethanol expo-
sure. Based on available human experience, ethanol is not considered a skin or 
respiratory allergen. 
Most human data on ethanol concern eff ects as a result of the consumption of 
alcoholic beverages. In th e epidemiological studies on  carcinogenic as well as 
non-carcinogenic effects, oral alcohol cons umption was usually measured by 
means of a self-administered questionnaire or interview, in which information was collected on the current (or recent pa st) frequency of consumption and the 
type and amount of beverages consumed weekly. Most studies did not collect 
information on the lifetime drinking history, implicitly assuming that the mea-
sured consumption is representative for th e drinking habits in the relevant time 
period for the develo pment of the effect. Effects in man 99Generally, drinking habits are not exactly similar over lifetime, but the 
change over time is only very gradual. However, this is not true for subjects who 
stopped completely because of medical  advice, pregnancy or other reasons. 
These subjects can bias the dose-response association if they are included with 
the non-drinkers. 
The validity of self-reported alcohol consumption has been subject of much 
discussion. Generally, the finding is that alcohol consumption is under-reported, 
in particular among high consumers. The ranking of subjects, important for assessing a dose-response associ ation, might be less affected. 
In most epidemiological studies only a rough distinction is made between 
light, moderate, and heavy alcohol consumption. In many epidemiological stud-ies the alcohol consumption is expresse d as the average amount of alcohol con-
sumed per day or week, leaving the pattern of alcohol consumption out of 
consideration. 
Several epidemiological studies reported that the dose-effect curve for ethanol 
appears to be U- or J-shaped, indicating be neficial effects, like a reduced risk of 
coronary heart disease, at low exposures. The most  critical non-carcinogenic 
effects in humans appear to be liver cirrhosis and effects on offspring (birth 
weight). With respect to carcinogenici ty the most relevant types of cancers 
appear to be breast and colorectal cancer. 
Liver cirrhosis is the irreversible and very  serious (usually fa tal) end stage of a 
disease process of the liver, which can be  adequately assessed in epidemiological 
studies. Two effects have to be balanced  in evaluating the effect of alcohol con-
sumption on liver toxicity: on the one hand liver damage may have been underes-timated as only the most serious endpoint was assessed, but on the other hand underreporting of alcohol consumption may have resulted in overestimation of the dose-response association. The net resu lt is unknown, but from a more practi-
cal approach, it seems sensible to conclude that a consumption level up to one unit (approximately 10-12 g of ethanol) pe r day is relatively safe, whereas higher 
doses may cause a risk of liver damage for some people. Based on the epidemio-
logical data for liver cirrhoses of good qua lity, there is no reason to set different 
limits for women than for men. 
For the human cancers that ar e likely to be caused directly by systemic exposure 
to alcohol (colorectal and br east cancer) it is possible to derive a dose-response 
association. For colorectal cancer the dose response relationship is assumed to be 100 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)the same for both genders and a threshold of 20 g/day is suggested. The dose 
response association for breast cancer has been found in women. For every 10 grams of daily ethanol consumption the ex cess breast cancer risk is calculated to 
increase by 7-10 per 1000 women. There are only limited data available concern-
ing the risk for breast cancer in men. 
The Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction is of the opinion that 
drinking small amounts of ethanol (less than 10 g/day) might decrease fertility in both men and women. Effects on development have been observed after maternal consumption of 1-10 grams per day as well . High levels of alcohol consumption 
have been found to cause Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). The epidemiological studies strongly suggest that the facial malformation characteristic of FAS result 
from exposure to high levels of ethanol during the first trimester, but reducing 
alcohol consumption in the second trim ester may reduce the adverse effects. 
Whether the individual anomalies charact erising FAS may also result from a 
lower exposure to alcohol is not clear.Effects in experimental animals 1017 Chapter
Effects in experimental animals
7.1 Irritation and sensitisation
95-99% ethanol was not irritating to the sk in of rabbits in tests performed accord-
ing to OECD guideline 404 (a 4-h semi-occlusive exposure to 0.5 ml)1,143. A 24-
h occlusive test induced mild irritation on rabbit skin142. 
96% ethanol induced some irritation on the rabbit eye in a Draize test142. In a 
test performed according to OECD 405 guid elines for acute eye irritation/corro-
sion, ethanol was shown to be strongly irritating142.
The allergenic potential of ethanol was assessed in a Magnusson-Kligman 
maximising test with guinea pigs. A 75% solution did not induce or trigger aller-genic skin reaction
142. In the mouse ear sensitisation assay performed on BALB/
c mice, ethanol did not induce any adverse effects12.
In two inhalation studies on mice the results of an Alarie test for sensory irri-
tants gave RD50 values of 25,983 mg/m3 (13,675 ppm) and 51,897 mg/m3 
(27,314 ppm), respectively12.
7.2 Toxicity due to acute exposure
Ethanol is of low acute toxicity via inhala tion, and via the oral and dermal routes 
of exposure. The lowest lethal co ncentration reported is 24,130 mg/m3 (12,700 
ppm), during a 22-h exposure of rats12, while rats exposed for 3.75 hours sur-102 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)vived 85,500 mg/m3 (45,000 ppm). The lowest reported deadly dose in mice is 
55,100 mg/m3 (29,000 ppm) after 7 hours of exposure, whereas the LC50-value 
was 39,900 mg/m3 (21,000 ppm) after 4 hours1. Aspiration of 0.2 ml of 100% 
ethanol caused death in 5 out of 10 rats tested, whereas 0.2 ml of 70% ethanol in water caused death in 1 of 10 rats
12. The symptoms of acute poisoning range, 
with increasing concentration, from irritation of the mucous membranes and 
excitability through ataxia, lack of co-ordination and hyperactivity; to lethargy, 
rapid, shallow breathing and finally death by respiratory failure in rat, guinea pig and mouse
12,141,247. The severity of the symptoms increased with increasing 
exposure time, and reduced the concentr ation necessary to provoke a specific 
response. A recent test performed on male  Wistar rats demonstrated at which 
concentration levels these symptoms can be expected248. Animals were exposed 
for 12 hours to concentrations of  29, 37, 43, 51 and 56 g ethanol/m3 air, respec-
tively (15,263; 19,474; 22,632; 26,842  and 29,474 ppm). No intoxication was 
observed in rats exposed to the lowest concentration, while mild lethargy and incoordination was induced after 3 hours exposure to 56 g/m
3 (BAC 960 ±50   
mg/l). After 6 hours, when BAC was 2290 ±140 mg/l, rats displayed substantial 
lethargy and incoordination, and 9 hours exposure (BAC 3390 ±200 mg/l) 
resulted in severe lethargy and incoordina tion, loss of muscle tonus and severe 
loss of righting reflex. At 12 hours (BAC 4150 ±260 mg/l), three of six rats dis-
played no corneal reflex, five of six had no righting reflex. One study reported increases in motor effects on male CD-1 mice as a function of  concentration and 
exposure time, with an EC
50 of 94,517 mg/m3 (49,746 ppm) for 10 min, 61,589 
mg/m3 (32,415 ppm) for 30 min and 57,564 mg/m3 (30,297 ppm) for 60 min247. 
Male Charles-River-CD rats inhaling 15,200 mg/m3 (8,000 ppm) or more for 
more than 4 hours showed changes in behavioural tests, while 7,600 mg/m3 
(4,000 ppm) had no effect. Exposure to 7,828 mg/m3 (4,120 ppm) resulted in a 
decreased avoidance performance after 4 hours249. The lowest adverse effect 
level found in literature is a study by Ghosh et al.  on behavioural effects of etha-
nol inhalation in F344-rats. The animals were trained either to press a lever to receive a sucrose solution (l iquid-reinforced schedule) or  to press a lever giving a 
pleasant electrical stimulation (self-stim ulation). The behavioural depression was 
significant at 384 mg/m
3 (202 ppm) and 756 mg/m3 (398 ppm) after 45 min of 
exposure. There were no effects during a 5-h exposure to 266 mg/m3 (140 ppm). 
A high degree of tolerance developed from day 3 forth during a 2-h daily expo-sure to 391 mg/m
3 (206 ppm) for 5 days. Likewise, there were no significant 
changes in the reinforcement rate  of rats exposed to 194 mg/m3 (102 ppm) or 384 
mg/m3 (202 ppm) for 80 min. The self-stimulation tests did not result in signifi-Effects in experimental animals 103cant changes in the reinforcement rate. The blood ethanol concentration was 
determined to be approximately 393 mg/l (given as 393 μg/ml) after exposure to 
1140 mg/m3 (600 ppm), and 545 mg/l (given as 545 μg/ml) after exposure to 
2,280 mg/m3 (1,200 ppm)250. 
The LD50 for single-dose oral toxicity in the rat also varies substantially (6.2-
17.8 g/kg), with the age of the animals (Table 6.7). The oral LD50 for guinea pig 
(5.6 g/kg) and dog (5.5-6.6 g/kg) are lower than for the rat.
The lowest lethal dermal dose for rabbits is reported to be 20 g/kg bw1.
In conclusion, an acute exposure with o cclusion to 95% ethanol caused mild irri-
tation in rabbits. 96% ethanol is mildly irritating to the eyes of the rabbit. The 
lowest lethal dose by inhalation is 55,100 mg/m3 (29,000 ppm) in mice (7-h 
exposure) and 24,130 mg/m3 (12,700 ppm) in rats ( 22 hours). In one study 
behavioural depression occurred in rats inhaling 384 mg/m3 (202 ppm) for 45 
minutes, although the rats developed tolerance after two days in a similar expo-sure scenario, and there was no effect on  the reinforcement ra te by exposure to 
384 mg/m
3 (202 ppm) for 80 minutes. The lowest reported lethal dermal dose for 
rabbits is 20 g/kg bw.

7.3.1 Inhalation studies
A 14-day inhalation study with two groups of 9 male Sprague Dawley rats was 
carried out. The test group was continuously exposed whole body to 25,000    mg/m
3 ethanol (13,250 ppm). Blood samples were  taken at 10 AM on days 4, 6, 
8, 10, 12, 13 and 14. Stable, constant bl ood ethanol levels were obtained over the 
14-day period (ca. 1690 mg/l; range 1 200-1990 mg/l). Controls were exposed to 
clean air. No changes in body weight gain were observed. Haematological obser-
vations revealed a decrease in the relativ e proportion of granulocytes and a con-
comitant increase in the relative proportion of lymphocytes, although the total white blood cell count had not changed. No changes were observed in erythro-
cyte count or haemoglobin c ontent. When compared to controls, decreases in cel-
lularity were observed in the spleen, thymus and bone marrow. In bone marrow, 
the number of erythroid progenitor cel ls was reduced whereas the granulocyte-
macrophage progenitor cells were unaffected. Splenic lymphocytes did not show significant differences in the ability to  proliferate when stimulated by non-spe-
cific mitogens
251. 
In a 5-week inhalation study, two groups  of 6 male Sprague Dawley rats each 
were continuously exposed to either ethanol or room air. The ethanol concentra-
tion was not measured but was maintained at a high level ( i.e. a concentration 
that resulted in ataxia). After an initia l increase in blood alcohol levels until day 
12, blood alcohol levels remained between 2000-3000 mg/l. Ethanol exposure resulted in decreased body weight gain and increased the act ivities of catalase 
and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in the lung but not in the liver. Although hepatic glutathione and vitamin E were reduced there was no increase in malond-
ialdehyde content in either liver or lung. The elevation of pulmonary antioxidant 
enzyme activities could indi cate that lung is a target  for ethanol-induced oxida-
tive stress. But since no loss of pulmonary GSH or vitamin E and no increase in malondialdehyde formation was observed, it appeared that ethanol exposure did not produce a significant degree of oxidative stress
252. Other endpoints were not 
examined.  
In a 90-day inhalation study 15 male and female rats (Sprague Dawley and 
Long Evans), 15 male and female guinea pigs, 3 male New Zealand rabbits, 3 male squirrel monkeys and 2 male Beagle dogs were continuously exposed whole-body to 86 mg/m
3 ethanol (46 ppm) for 90 days. No clinical signs of tox-
icity were observed. Haematology and histopathological examination of liver, Effects in experimental animals 105kidneys, lungs, heart, spleen did not re veal any treatment-r elated changes in 
these species. Also, histopathology of brain, spinal cord and adrenals of monkeys and dogs was negative
253. In the latter study it was noted by the committee that 
although control animals had been used, no information was provided on these 
animals.
Overall, since in these studies with re peated inhalation ex posure only one con-
centration of ethanol was tested and only specific endpoints were studied, these studies are not appropriate to establish health-based occupational exposure lim-
its. From these data, however, it was concluded that at the low concentration of 86 mg/m
3 no changes were observed, whereas at the high levels used in the other 
two studies ( i.e. resulting in blood alcohol concentrations > 1700 mg/l), only 
slight toxicity was observed.
7.3.2 Oral studies
Ethanol (1.5 ml of 47.5% ethanol per 100 g body weight; corresponding to ca.    
7 g/kg bw) given daily to rats (not specified) by gastric intubation for 11 days 
revealed a significant increase in the he patic concentration of  esterified fatty 
acids when compared to controls given isovolumetric amounts of water. Animals fed for 30 days a liquid diet with 33% of the calories as ethanol also revealed an increase in the hepatic concentrations of total esterified fatty acids and triglycer-
ides when compared to pair-fed controls receiving the same diet except that etha-
nol was isocalorically substituted by carbohydrate. Liver histology of the 
ethanol-fed animals revealed  marked fatty infiltration
254. In several other animal 
studies, repeated intake of ethanol has resulted in damage of almost all organ sys-tems, with the liver as the main target organ
1.
In a study on the effects of ethanol at  the brain level, a group of 10 male 
Wistar rats was given ethanol in drinking water (3% v/v) for 8 weeks, resulting in 
a mean intake of 4 g/kg bw/day. A sim ilar control group received an equivalent 
diet in which ethanol was substituted by an equicaloric amount of sucrose. Etha-nol treatment ameliorated emotional react ivity and improved learning. The con-
comitant measure of neurochemical para meters indicated changes in receptor 
(dopamine) and post-recepto r (protein kinase C) mechanisms. The authors con-
cluded that a dose of 4 g ethanol/kg bw/day did not produce dependence and relieved stress in otherwise normally behaving rats
255.
Ethanol appears to affect several orga ns after oral administration with the 
liver as main target organ. Increased hepa tic concentrations of  fatty acid and trig-106 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)lycerids were observed after a 30-day admin istration of a liquid diet containing

7.4 Toxicity due to long-term exposure and carcinogenicity
7.4.1 Inhalation studies
No studies have been found.
7.4.2 Oral studies
The IARC172 concluded that there was inade quate evidence for the carcinogenic-
ity of ethanol in animals.
To determine the effects on life-span of daily consumption of alcohol 
throughout adulthood, three groups of 100 male C57BL/10J mice (individually housed) were given 3.5% ethanol from week 14-19, and next 3.5, 7.5 or 12% v/v ethanol in distilled water as the only source of drinking fluid for the rest of their lives. Two control groups of 100 mice each  (one group singly housed and the 
other housed five to a cage) received di stilled water ad libitum. Based on the 
fluid intake the authors calculated an av erage ethanol intake of ca. 2.8, 7.3 or 
11.1 g/kg bw/day, respectively. Blood samples were taken when mice were 27 
weeks old and at two 3-month periods ther eafter. Four samples were taken at dif-
ferent times of the day so that 12 samples per mouse were obtained. Mean blood alcohol levels were 66, 142 and 268 mg/kg blood (more or less equal to mg/l blood), respectively. There was no differ ence between the survival rates of the 
3.5% alcohol and water-drinking singly housed controls. The 7.5% alcohol group 
had a significantly longer lifespan when compared to the single-housed controls. 
Of the singly housed animals 72-89 animals per group were examined histo-pathologically; of the cage housed animals only 55 due to cannibalism. Inci-dence, kind and degree of non-neoplastic hepatic lesions did not differ among the groups. In addition, no treatment-related changes were observed in brain, lungs, heart, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, duodenu m or testes. The incidence and kind of 
neoplastic lesions in the individual groups did not indicate ethanol 
carcinogenicity
256.
In 1996, a 2-year oral carcinogenicity st udy with ethanol (administered in drink-
ing water) in mice was started by NTP257. Male and female B6C3F1 mice were 
exposed to ethanol (92.6% ethanol, 7.4% water) in drinking water for 4 weeks or 2 years. Groups of four male and four fe male mice were exposed to 0%, 2.5%, or Effects in experimental animals 1075% ethanol in drinking water ad libitum fo r 4 weeks. Concentrations of 2.5% and 
5% ethanol resulted in average daily consumption of approximately 85 and 170 mg ethanol for males and 70 and 130 mg for females. In the 2-year study, groups of 48 male and 48 female mice were exposed to 0%, 2.5%, or 5% ethanol in drinking water ad libitum. Concentrations of 2.5% and 5% ethanol resulted in average daily consumption of approximately 100 and 180 mg ethanol for males 
and 80 and 155 mg for females. The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms 
occurred with positive trends in males exposed to increasing concentrations of 
ethanol (hepatocellular adenoma: 0% ethanol, 7/46; 2.5% ethanol, 12/47; 5% ethanol, 19/48; hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma: 12/46, 16/47, 25/48). Under the conditions of this 2-year drinking water study, NTP concluded the design of their study was inadequate to  determine the carci nogenic activity of 
ethanol in male and female mice
257.
Sprague Dawley rats (50 rats/sex/group) were fed 1 or 3% ethanol or an equica-
loric amount of glucose in a semi-synthetic liquid diet for 104 weeks. Based on dietary intake it was estimated that thes e doses corresponded to ca. 1 or 3 g/kg 
bw/day. From week 104-120 animals were kept on a liquid control diet. Survival 
was similar in all groups. Body weights were reduced from week 13 in males and 
from week 69 in females of the high dose group. No changes in liver and kidney weights were observed. Histopathological examination revealed more non-neo-plastic changes in ethanol-t reated animals when  compared to controls. In males 
these changes included liver and bile duc t injury and inflammatory reactions of 
the pancreas. In females, inflammatory react ions were found in the clitoral gland, 
and hyperplasia in the adrenals. Rats of both sexes showed hyperplasia of the 
thyroid gland and peripheral nerve degeneration. For male rats, no neoplastic lesions were observed that could be rela ted to ethanol exposure. For females, an 
increase in mammary gland tumours was seen for females receiving the low eth-
anol containing diet, but not in animals of the high ethanol containing diet group. In some tumour frequency comparisons the opposite, namely a decrease in the 
rate of incidence, was obtained. Overall,  the total tumour incidence was signifi-
cantly reduced in animals of the high dose group. Based on these results the 
authors concluded that there was no carcinogenic activity of ethanol after long-term oral administration
258.
To study influence of ethanol on vinyl chloride-induced hepatocarcinogenic-
ity, a (control) group of 80 male Sprague  Dawley rats received drinking water 
with 5% ethanol v/v. Based on an averag e intake of 15 ml a day and an average 
body weight of 350 g a dose of ca. 2 g ethanol/kg bw/day was estimated. Another 108 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)control group of 80 rats received water. There was no control group to control for 
the increase of ethanol-derived calories. Su rvival rate after 18 months was simi-
lar, i.e. 73 and 70% for the ethanol and contro l group, respectivel y. In the ethanol 
group, at the end of the study, the in cidence of hepatic carcinomas was 8, the 
incidence of hyperplastic nodules was 29, whereas in the control group, these figures were 1 and 10, respectively. The incidences of endocrine tumours were 
26/79 and 8/80 (pituitary), 14/79 and 0/80 (adrenals), 14/79 and 0/80 (pancreas; 
not further specified), and 3/79 and 0/80 (testes), for the ethanol and control group, respectively. In total, 91 tumours were diagnosed in the ethanol group, of which 44% were classified as malignant. In the control group 16 tumours were observed of which 5 were malignant
259.
The committee noticed that in some of the experiments, tumor incidences were 
increased, despite the fact that the MT D has not been reached. Therefore the 
committee is of the opinion that, the results from these experiments were not conclusive: Tumour incidences were in creased in male Sprague Dawley rats 
upon chronic intake of ethanol-containing drinking water, but not in male and female rats of the same strain upon oral intake of ethanol through a liquid diet. A 
drinking water study in mice was also negative. NTP concluded that from a        
2-year drinking water study that there the design of their study was inadequate to determine the carcinogenic activity of ethanol in male and female mice.
7.5 Genotoxicity
7.5.1 In vitro
See for a summary of in vitro  genotoxicity tests table 7.2.
Bacterial mutation assays
Ethanol was negative in several Salmonella ( S. typhimurium ) strains i.e TA97, 
TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538 both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation
172. In another study ethanol was tested using strains 
TA97 and TA102. Ethanol, with metabolic activation, induced a reproducible 
increase in revertants over controls but this was less than 2-fold and only 
observed at a very high concentration of 160 mg/plate260. The authors, however, 
concluded that this result might not neces sarily point to genotoxic activity of eth-
anol but could also have been caused by impu rities present. The same           Effects in experimental animals 109investigators had earlier shown that ethanol was negative in TA98, TA100, 
TA1535, TA1537, TA1538260. 
A 10 min incubation of E. coli  strain CHY832 (temperature-sensitive pheno-
type RK+) with 180 mg ethanol per ml without metabolic activation resulted in an increased forward mutation frequency, i.e. an increase in temperature-insensi-
tive bacteria. However, surviving rate was only 15% (Hay84). A differential 
DNA repair tests with derivates of E. coli  using ethanol (1720 mmol/l) was 
negative
261.

Historical data showed no evidence of mutagenicity with or without S9 for solvent controls with a typical  ethanol concentration of 100 
μl (79 mg)/plate262.
Mutation in yeast 
Using S. cerevisiae , ethanol was mutagenic, albeit  at an incubation temperature 
of 30°C only. At 4 °C the test was negative. Using A. nidulans , a concentration of 
5% ethanol (40 mg/ml) resulted in aneuploidy (non-disjunction, mitotic recombination). No forward mutations were induced
172.
Micronucleus assay
There were no increases in micronuclei in V79 cells following a 1 h incubation 
period with 5% ethanol (40 mg/ml)172.  
Chromosome aberration tests
A total of 13 investigations using human lymphocytes were described by 
IARC172. An incubation period of 24-48 hours of 0.5-1% ethanol (4-8 mg/ml) 
did not induce chromosome aberrations. No metabolic activation was used. 
There were no increases in chromosome aberrations in Chinese Hamster 
Ovary (CHO) cells upon a 30 min incubation period with 1% ethanol                   (8 mg/ml)
172.  
Human blood lymphocytes were incubated with 1.16, 2.32 or 3.48 mg/ml 
ethanol for 50 h. A dose-related increase in chromosome stru ctural aberrations 
was observed in the absence of metabo lic activation. Chromatid and chromo-
some gaps and breaks were recorded separately264.
Ethanol has been used as a vehicle in  chromosome aberration assays using 
human lymphocytes and CHL cel ls. Historical data demons trated a lack of chro-
mosome aberration induction both with and without metabolic activation at a 
concentration of 8 mg/ml ethanol (174 mM)262.
Cell mutation assaysEthanol was negative in the L5178Y Mouse Lymphoma TK assay at the highest 
tested concentration of 4.5% (36 mg/ml)
265. It is, however, noted that ethanol 
was tested without metabolic activation. Effects in experimental animals 111Historical data demonstrated a lack of mutagenic activity both with and with-
out metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma cell mutation assay at a concen-tration of 8 mg/ml (174 mM) ethanol
262.
Sister chromatid exchanges (SCE)
A total of 13 investigations using human lymphocytes were described by 
IARC172. An incubation period of 48-72 hours of ethanol concentrations of 0.1-
2% (0.8-16 mg/ml) did not reveal incr eases in SCEs. No metabolic activation 
was used. The only study in which metabolic activation was used did not show an increase in SCE upon application of 0.1% ethanol (0.8 mg/ml). 
Ethanol was investigated on its potential to induce Sister Chromatid 
Exchanges (SCE) in CHO cells by several investigators. No metabolic activation 
was used. The following test protocols we re negative: 0.5 h with 1% ethanol (8 
mg/ml), 3 h with ca. 0.6% (4.8 mg/ml), 28  h with 1% (8 mg/ml) or 8 days with 
0.1% (0.8 mg/ml) daily. Also a 44 h treatment of mouse kidney fibroblasts with 0.1% ethanol (0.8 mg/ml) did not induce SCEs
172. 
In contrast, incubation of CHO cells with 0.5, 1, 2 or 4% ethanol (4, 8, 16 or 
32 mg/ml) using metabolic activation, resulted in an increase in SCE already at 
the lowest concentration. The maximal in crease of three times the control value 
was reached at a concentration of 2%. Th ere was no cytotoxi city. Without meta-
bolic activation, the SCE rate increased only 1.5-fold. Results were similar for 
both technical (96%) ethanol and absolute (100%) ethanol266. 
DNA damage
A 3 h incubation of primary rat hepatocyte s with 1% ethanol (8 mg/ml) did not 
reveal DNA damage172. 
A 1 h incubation of human lymphocytes  with 1.56-100 mM ethanol (0.07-4.6 
mg/ml) did not reveal DNA single- or double-strand breaks. No cytotoxicity was observed
267.
7.5.2 In vivo experiments
Somatic cells
See for a summary of in vivo  genotoxicicity tests in somatic cells Table 7.3.112 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Micronucleus assay 
Ethanol (40% v/v; ca. 50 g ethanol/kg bw/day) given to Swiss mice in drinking 
water for 26 days did not result in an increase in micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow. This was al so true upon subcutaneous application 
of 0.05 ml of a 95% ethanol solution to male ddy-mice
172. 
Three groups of 10-week old Parkes albino mice consisting of 4 males and 4 
females each were injected intraperitoneal ly on 2 consecutive days with 0.3 ml of 
20, 40 or 60% ethanol, corresponding to 0.62, 1.24 or 1.86 g/kg bw. A control 
group with the same number of animals received no treatment. Six hours after the Table 7.3   Summary of in vivo  genotoxicicity tests in somatic cells.

polychromatic and normochromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow. A number of 1000 cells per animal were examined. The test groups had higher frequencies of micronuclei than controls , but a dose-response relationship was not obtained ( i.e. 
statistical significance was only reached at the two lower doses). The maximum 
increase was about two times the control value
264. It is, however, noted that the 
study is of limited relevance, since the control group mean micronucleus fre-
quencies of 4.63 and 5.60% in normochr omatic and polychromatic erythrocytes, 
respectively, should be considered very high. 
Adult male Wistar rats were given 10% v/v (4 rats/group) or 20% v/v (1 rat/
group) ethanol (ca. 4 or 8 g/kg bw/day) as their only liquid supply for 3 or 6 
weeks. Control rats (2/gr oup) received tap water. At the end of the treatment 
period, rats were sacrificed and examined for micronuclei in hepatocytes and erythrocytes in bone marrow. There were no increases in the number of micronuclei
268. These results are of limited value, however, in view of the very 
limited number of animals used in this study. 
Male CD rats (10) were given a nutritionally adequate liquid diet containing 
36% as ethanol (ca. 12-16 g/kg bw/day) for 6 weeks. A control group of 10 rats 
was pair-fed a liquid diet containing 36% carbohydrate. Blood alcohol concen-trations measured were about 1500 mg/l. Alcohol feeding resulted in a body weight gain reduction of 15% and in a sl ight, though signifi cantly, increased fre-
quency of micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes. This was associated with 
bone marrow hypoplasia and erythrocyte macrocytosis
269. By contrast, acute eth-
anol administration (6 g/kg bw) by gastric intubation (10% solution) the day 
before sacrifice (4 pm) followed by 3 g/kg bw at 9 am six hours before sacrifice to four rats produced no changes in bone marrow cell population, mitotic index or percentage of cells with micronuclei.  According to the au thors these results 
suggest that prolonged alcohol consumption is required to produce the bone mar-row changes
269.
Ethanol at its maximum tolerated dose level (2 g/kg bw) was used as the vehicle 
in standard mouse micronucleus assays using the oral route. No increase in micronucleus frequency above expected levels was observed
262.114 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Chromosome aberration assay
Adult male Wistar rats were given 10% v/v (4 rats/group) or 20% v/v (1 rat/
group) ethanol (ca. 4 or 8 g/kg bw/day) as their only liquid supply for 3 or 6 weeks. Control rats (2/group) received ta p water. At the end of the treatment 
period, rats were sacrificed and examin ed for chromosomal aberrations in bone 
marrow and blood lymphocytes. There were no increases in the number of chro-
mosomal aberrations
268. These results are of limited value, however, in view of 
the very limited number of animals used in this study. 
In Chinese hamsters the incidence of chromosomal aberrations in bone mar-
row cells was not increased following intake  of ethanol (10% in drinking water) 
for 9 weeks, nor was the incidence of chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes 
following oral intake for 46 weeks. The incidence of chromoso mal aberrations in 
bone marrow cells was neither increased following intake of ethanol (10% in drinking water the first week, followed by  15% in the second and third week, and 
by 20% in the 4th-12th week)
172. 
Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE)
Groups of male CBA mice were given 10 or 20% (v/v) ethanol (ca. 12 or 25 g 
ethanol /kg bw/day) as their only liquid supply for 3 to 16 weeks. Control ani-mals received tap water. After 3, 5, 12 or 16 weeks (10% groups), or after 12 or 
16 weeks (20% groups), animals were sacrificed and bone marrow was exam-ined. Significant increases in SCE were fou nd at both dose levels and at all sacri-
fice points; the maximum increase was ca. 1.5 times the control value
270. The 
results of this study, however, are of limited value in view of the limited number of animals used (2-4 per group per time point; with one exception of 6 per group) and the limited number of examined metaphases (minimally 15 but not more than ca. 30 per animal).  
Upon intraperitoneal application of 50% ethanol (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 or 2.4 g/kg bw) 
to male NIH mice, a slight but dose-rela ted increase in the number of SCEs was 
found in bone marrow cells. Thirty cells (in second division) were counted per 
mouse, but the number of mice per dose level was not indicated. At the highest dose of 2.4 g/kg bw a 1.4 times increas e in SCEs was obser ved when compared 
to controls. The average genera tion time (AGT) was not changed
271. 
ICR mice were force-fed with ethanol at  different doses, administration rates 
and durations during pregnancy. The highest cumulative dosis was 8 g ethanol/kg 
bw. The maximal blood alcohol level was 450 mg/l. BrdU was administered sub-Effects in experimental animals 115cutaneously in the animals between days  16-18 of gestation. Twenty-one hours 
later, the animals were killed, the foetuses  removed and the foet al liver cells were 
examined for SCEs. Per dosis group 2-3 pregnant animals were treated; per litter 50 metaphases were examined. A dose-relat ed increase in SCEs up to two-times 
the control value was found in ethanol-fed mice. Doses up to 4 g/kg bw did not result in increased numbers of SCEs
272. 
A single application of a 10% ethanol solution (4 g/kg bw) to four pregnant 
ICR mice on day 10 of gestation resulted in a 1.5 times higher SCE frequency in litter-pooled embryo chromosomes when  compared to controls. This dose 
resulted in a blood alcohol level of 2250 mg/l. A dose of 2 g/kg was inactive
273.
Adult male Wistar rats were given 10% v/v (4 rats/group) or 20% v/v (1 rat/
group) ethanol (ca. 4 or 8 g/kg bw/day) as their only liquid supply for 3 or 6 
weeks. Control rats (2/gr oup) received tap water. At the end of the treatment 
period, rats were sacrificed and examined for SCEs in bone marrow and blood lymphocytes. The SCE frequency in blood lymphocytes was 1.5 times higher in both treatment groups following 3 and 6 weeks of treatment when compared to 
controls
268. These results are of limited value, however, in view of the very lim-
ited number of animals used in this study.
In Chinese hamsters the incidence of SCEs in bone marrow cells was not 
increased following intake of ethanol (10% in drinking water the first week, fol-lowed by 15% in the second and third week, and by 20% in the 4th-12th week). Also, no increases in SCEs were observed upon oral intake (10% in drinking water) for 46 weeks
172. 
DNA adduct formation
A group of 7 male C57BL/6 mice was give n ethanol in drinking water (10% v/v) 
ad libitum for 5 weeks (ca. 12 g/ethanol/k g bw/day). At the end of the treatment 
period, animals were killed, livers were  excised and the DNA isolated for meas-
urement of DNA adducts using the 32P- postlabelling method. The average con-
centration of the adducts was 1.5 ± 0.8 adducts per 108 nucleotides. No adducts 
were found in untreated controls; the level of detection was 5 adducts per 109 
nucleotides274. 
Germinal cellsSee for a summary of in vivo  genotoxicicity tests in germinal cells Table 7.4.116 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)Non-disjunction and aneuploidy
Male CBA/CA mice were administered ca. 0.8 ml of 12.5 or 15% ethanol in PBS 
(ca. 5 g/kg bw) by gastric intubation. Blood alcohol levels of 4,000-6,000 mg/kg (~4,000-6,000 mg/l) were obtained. Cont rols received PBS only. Most test ani-
mals showed signs of CNS depression some 15-20 min after gastric instillation; complete recovery occurred within severa l hours. The animals were sacrificed 2, 
3, 4, 5 or 6 h after treatment and the testes were removed and cell counts of sec-

aneuploidy level of controls ( i.e. 0.50%) was significantly lower. When the 
results of the test groups were pooled, a decrease in aneuploidy was seen with 
time275. It is, however, noted that only 7 to 10 animals per group were used, 
resulting in only 1 or 2 animals per sacrifice point and the maximum number of counted cells at each sacrifice point was only 190.  
No increase in chromosome aberrations  was observed in spermatogonia of 
male Wistar rats that had received 10% ethanol in drinking water
172. A drinking 
water study in which Sprague Dawley rats received ethanol over 36 weeks, grad-ually increased from 7% until 20% (w/v), also did not reveal differences in chro-mosomal aberrations in testicular cells
276. It is, however, noted that although the 
control and test group cons isted of about 30 animals each, the nu mber of analys-
able mitoses was limited and very variable.
No aneuploidy was observed in spermatogonia and spermatids type I and II 
of male Chinese hamsters upon administration of 1.5 ml of 12.5% ethanol172. 
Recently mated 6-8 weeks old (C57BLxCBA) F1 mice were given orally 1 ml of 
either a 10%, 12.5% or 15% solution of ethanol (ca. 4-6 g/kg bw) in distilled 
water 13.5 h after superovulation (ca. 1. 5-2.5 h after the predicted time of ovula-
tion). Controls received distilled water. The females were sacrificed 6-7 h later 
and the eggs were examined for the presence of pronuclei. In the test animals, the 
percentage of aneuploidic cells was between 5.9 and 18.9% but no dose-response relationship was obtained. No aneuploidy was observed in controls. Since from this test it was not clear whether the origin of the aneuploidy was male- or 
female-derived, a second series of experiments was carried out. 
(C57BLxCBA)F1 mice were mated with males that were homozygous for the T6 translocation in which a reciprocal chan ge occurs between segments of chromo-
somes 14 and 15 with the resultant production of a larger and a small transloca-tion product (T6 marker chromosome). Th e female mice were given orally 1 ml 
of a 12.5% solution of ethanol (ca. 5 g/kg bw) in distilled water 13.5 h after superovulation (ca. 1.5-2.5 h after the pr edicted time of ovulation). The females 
were sacrificed 6-7 h later and the eggs were examined for the presence of pronu-
clei. The results of this st udy showed that the percenta ge of aneuploidic cells was 
17.9% and that the non-disj unction was female-derived
277. 
Eight to twelve week-old female CFLP  mice, after induction of a superovula-
tion, were mated with naive males. Female s that had mated were given 1.5 ml of 
a 12.5% ethanol solution (ca. 7.5 g/kg/bw) via gastric intubation 4, 13.5 or 17 h 
after the superovulation. Blood alcohol levels reached levels up to 2600-2800 118 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)mg/l. Controls received distilled wate r 13.5 h after the superovulation. The 
females were sacrificed 20-21 h after th e superovulation (first cleavage), on the 
3rd day (morula stage) or on gestation day 10 or 11. The incidence of aneuploidy was significantly increased (approximate ly 19% and 13.5%) 20-21 h after the 
superovulation or the 3rd day, respectivel y, with a similar number of monosomic 
and trisomic conceptuses. In addition, about 2% of all conceptuses examined 
were triploid. From animals sacrificed on gestation day 10 or 11, only the mor-
phological abnormal or developmentally retarded embryos were determined. Eight embryos of a total of 16 were eith er aneuploid or triploid, whereas in the 
control group only one out of 11 examined proved to be aneuploid
278.
Female 10-12 weeks old (C3H x C57)F1 mice were, after induction of a 
superovulation, mated with untreated males. Females that showed a vaginal plug 
(19 in total) were administered orally with 1 ml 12.5% ethanol (ca. 5 g/kg bw) 
ca. 1.5 to 2.5 h after ovul ation. A control group (13)  received distilled water. 
About 9-10 hours later, th e animals received 2.5 mg co lchicin/kg bw intraperito-
neally. Fifteen hour s after colchicine treatment cytogenetic analysis was per-
formed. In total 105 embryos were examined in the test group, whereas 59 were examined in the control gr oup. The percentage of em bryos with a normal chro-
mosome number (40) was not different between test and control group. Two 
embryos with 41 chromosomes were observed in the test group (none in con-trols), and 11 embryos with 39 chromosomes were found (2 in controls). It was concluded by the authors that ethanol treatment resulted in aneuploidy
279.
Dominant lethal assay
In a dominant lethal assay, groups of 10-week old male CBA mice were given 
0.1 ml of a 40% ethanol solution (ca. 1.24 g/kg bw) once a day for 3 consecutive days. Controls received no al cohol treatment. After treatment the test males were 
allowed to mate with virgin females at 7-day intervals until the 6
th week. Preg-
nant females were allowed to produce thei r litters, size, sex ratio and morpholog-
ical abnormalities of the litters were r ecorded. The frequency of fertile matings 
was not different amongst the groups. A significantly reduced litter size was 
observed produced from ma tings that took place 14-17 days after cessation of 
treatment. In two repeat experiments, 40 and 60% ethanol solutions were used (ca. 1.24 and 1.86 g/kg bw). Males were allowed to mate at 4-day intervals. Preg-nant females were not allowed to produce their litters but were sacrificed 13-15 
days after conception. The nu mber of corpora lutea, dead  and live implants were 
examined. There was a significant increase in the number of d ead implants (con-Effects in experimental animals 119comitant with a decrease in the number of life implants) in females mated on 
days 4-13 after treatment with both dose levels. Male group size was 6-13264,280.
In a dominant lethal assay (carried out in three labo ratories as a ring study) 
10-week old male CFLP mice (15/group) were given 10 or 40% ethanol (2 ml/kg bw/dag) for 5 consecutive days. In a preliminary study, the high dose of 0.6 g ethanol/kg bw/day was concluded to be the MTD (maximum tolerated dose). 
Next, each male was caged sequentially w ith 2 untreated virgin females (10-12 
weeks old) each week for 8 consecutive weeks. All females were killed and examined 18 days after firs t being caged with the males. The dominant lethal 
mutation rate was not increased in the th ree tests. The few statistically significant 
changes observed were not consistent and did not point to dominant lethal mutations
281.  
To determine dominant lethal mutations in egg cells, 10-12 weeks old (C3H x 
C57)F1 female mice were administered orally 1 ml 12.5% ethanol (ca. 5 g etha-nol/kg bw) or distilled water 1, 1.5 or 2 h after mating. The females were sacri-
ficed on day 12 (1 and 1.5 h postmating groups) or day 17 (1 or 2 h post-mating groups) of gestation. The incidence of late death was found to be significantly increased when ethanol was administered 2 h following a 30-min mating period, 
but not when the interval was shorter. Fo etuses classified as having died late 
were those that had developed at least some eye pigment ( i.e. had died on day 11 
postconception or later). Measurements of  early death were not sensitive enough 
(because of the high control frequency) to  show an effect of ethanol treatment. A 
level of significance of <0.05 could only  be reached when group size was higher 
than 40
279.  
In a dominant lethal assay, a group of 10 male Long Evans rats was given 
20% v/v ethanol in the drinking water for 60 days (ca. 10 g/kg bw/day). Controls received distilled water. Each male was th en allowed to mate with three virgin 
female rats once per week for three cons ecutive weeks. The females were killed 
on day 20 of gestation, and the offspring were examined for fetal growth, skeletal ossification, and soft-tissue anomalies. Total embryonic deaths (resorptions and preimplantation loss) were increased by ethanol, while implantations and litter 
size were significantly decreased. Foetuses  fathered by alcoholic male rats were 
malformed: 55% had soft-tissue anomalie s (microcephalus, microphthalmia, cra-
nial fissure, and hydronephrosis). Litter  weight and average pups weight were 
also reduced by paternal ethanol consumption (
282; see also section 6.2.6).
In another dominant lethal assay, a group of male Wistar rats (number not 
indicated) received 30% etha nol in drinking water (ca.  15 g ethanol/kg bw) for 4 
days. Immediately after the last treatment the males were allowed to mate with 2-120 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)3 virgin female rats once per week for 8 consecutive weeks.  No changes were 
observed in the number of corpora lutea nor in the number of dead, live and total implantations when compared to an untreated control group (number not indi-cated). Also administration of ethanol to  male Wistar rats (numbers not indi-
cated) for 35 days, at concentrations increasing from 15 to 20% or from 15 to 30%, did not show dominant lethal mutations
283. In every group and at each mat-
ing point 26-30 female animals were used, which indicates that the number of 
males per group should have been minimally 9-10. 
A group of 6 male Sprague Dawley rats received a liq uid diet containing 6% 
ethanol during one week followed by a liquid diet containing 10% ethanol for another 4 weeks. Based on the daily liquid diet intake, a dose of 10-15 g ethanol/kg bw/day was estimated. Mean blood alcohol levels were low (0.5 mg%, i.e. 5 
mg/l) but it is noted that these levels we re measured only 12h after the last alco-
hol exposure. A control group of 6 male rats received th e liquid diet with an iso-
caloric amount of sucrose substituted fo r the alcohol. After 15 days each male 
was placed with 2 females during the hours of darkness; during this time diet and 
drinking water were not available. The males were separated from the females during light hours. Successful matings an d the first day of pregnancy were deter-
mined by the presence of vaginal plugs and of spermatozoa in the vaginal 
smears. All pregnancies were terminated on gestational day 20. Notable differ-ences detected were: a higher incidence of early abortions, a smaller mean litter size, an increased foetal weight, an increase in crown-rump length, and a 
decrease in placental index (r elating foetal weight to placental weight). Accord-
ing to the authors, the in crease in foetal weight a nd crown-rump length were 
explained by the smaller litter sizes. Taking  this into account , the mean growth 
index indicated smaller offspring from treated than from untreated males, 
although the difference was not  statistically significant (
284; see also section 
6.2.6). 
A group of male rats was administered 2 ml 40% ethanol solution (ca. 2.5    
g/kg bw). Two weeks later they were allowed to mate with virgin females. A sig-nificant increase in pre-a nd post-implantation losses were observed in treated 
males when compared to controls. The control group contained 34 pregnant 
females whereas the test group consisted of 11 pregnant females only. When male rats were allowed to mate 6 weeks after ethanol administration, no differ-ences were observed in pre- and post-implantation losses (
285 (in Russian; no 
English translation available) cited in1). However, due to several omissions in 
methodology the results of this study are difficult to judge1. Effects in experimental animals 121The Committee on the Evalua tion of the carcinogenicity of chemical substances 
concluded that a lot of information is available regarding th e genotoxic proper-
ties of ethanol. In a minority of the in vivo  and in vitro  genotoxicity tests (other 
than aneuploidy), ethanol was positive. Most genotoxicity tests were negative 
after treatment with ethanol. Therefore, based on the genotoxicity tests they con-
clude that there is only limited evidence for a genotoxic potential of ethanol. 
However, acetaldehyde, a genotoxic comp ound, is one of the major metabolites 
of ethanol and can be detected in the human body after ingestion of ethanol. As a role for acetaldehyde in th e genotoxicity of ethanol can not be excluded, the com-
mittee cannot neglect the few positive results in the genotoxicity test (see Annex E). 
7.6 Reproduction toxicity
7.6.1 Fertility
Inhalation studies
Whole body exposure of male Sprague Dawl ey rats (18 rats/group) to 0, 19,000 
or 30,400 mg/m3 ethanol (10,000 or 16,000 ppm, respectively) 7 h/day for 6 
weeks did not result in changes in male fertility upon mating with untreated 
females. No changes were observed in body weights, food and water intake of 
these males. Although blood alcohol levels were not measured in these studies, levels of 30 and 500 mg/l ethanol were reported to have been found in previous studies upon exposure to 19,000 or 30,400 mg/m
3, respectively286,287. It is, how-
ever, not indicated at which time blood samples were taken.
Oral studies
In a dominant lethal assay (carried out in three laboratories as a ring study) 10 
week-old male CFLP mice (15/group) were given 10 or 40% ethanol (2 ml/kg bw/day) for 5 consecutive days. In a preliminary study, the high dose of 0.6 g ethanol/kg bw/day was concluded to be a MTD (maximum tolerated dose). Next, each male was caged sequentially with 2 untreated virgin females (10-12 weeks 
old) each week for 8 consecutive weeks.  Ethanol did not in fluence mating behav-
iour and success (
281; see also section 6.2.5). It is, however, noted that a dose of 
0.6 g/kg bw/day, which was considered a MTD, was low in comparison with all 
other studies reported.122 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)A group of 6 male Sprague Dawley rats received a liquid diet containing 6% eth-
anol during one week follow ed by a liquid diet co ntaining 10% ethanol for 
another 4 weeks. Based on the daily liquid diet intake, a dose of 10-15 g ethanol/kg bw/day was estimated. A control group of 6 male rats received the liquid diet 
with an isocaloric amount of sucrose substituted for the alcohol. After 15 days each male was placed with 2 females duri ng the hours of darkness. Successful 
matings and the first day of pregnancy were  determined by the presence of vagi-
nal plugs and of spermatozoa in the vaginal smears. On day 36, all males were killed and blood samples collected. Obvious signs of intoxication such as weight loss, withdrawal symptoms (when liquid  diet was not available), decreased 
serum glucose and serum testosterone levels as well as reduced reproductive per-formance were observed  in treated males
284. 
A group of 10 male Long Evans rats was given 20% v/v ethanol in the drink-
ing water for 60 days (ca. 10 g/kg bw/d ay). Controls received distilled water. 
Each male was then allowed to mate with three virgin female rats once per week for three consecutive weeks. The males we re necropsied after the third mating. 
Ethanol caused mean testicular weight reductions and gross testicular atrophy in 1 of 10 males. Five matings of alcoholic  males proved infertile. No recovery in 
reproductive function was evident over the 21-day post-ethanol mating period
282.
Other studies into the fertility effects of ethanol following oral intake have 
shown that oral intake of high ethanol doses (> 2000 mg/kg day) by female rats and mice before and during pregnancy had no influence on mating behaviour. In 
males, repeated oral intake  of high ethanol doses resulted in tissue changes of 
reproductive organs of both rats and mi ce.Plasma testosteron and luteinising hor-
mone levels were reduced in male rats , whereas changes in oestrus cycle and 
ovary function were observed in female mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys
1.  
Overall, exposure of rats by inhalatio n up to concentrations of 30,400 mg/m3 eth-
anol (16,000 ppm), resulting in blood alcohol levels of about 500 mg/l, did not result in changes in male fertility. Oral intake of high amounts of ethanol (ca. 10 
g ethanol/kg bw/day or higher), in contrast, resulted in decreased reproductive 
performance, decreased serum testosterone  levels, decreased testicular weight 
and testicular atrophy in rats. An oral study in male mice at levels up to 0.6 g eth-anol/kg bw/day) did not influence mating behaviour and success. Other studies into the fertility effects of ethanol have shown that oral intake of high ethanol doses (> 2 g/kg bw/day) before and during pregnancy had no influence on mating 
behaviour of females.  Effects in experimental animals 1237.6.2 Developmental toxicity
Inhalation studies 
Groups of pregnant ICR mice (10 mice/ group) were continuously exposed whole 
body to 0 or 15,000 mg/m3 (7950 ppm) ethanol on gestation days 7-9 or on gesta-
tion days 7-12. In satellite, non-pregnant  animals, blood was sampled on days 1, 
3 and 6 of exposure. Blood alcohol levels  of 26-32 mg/l were found. Dams were 
sacrificed on day 18 of gestation. There were no significant differences in skele-
tal malformations or variations. The numb er of resorptions and dead foetuses 
was increased, and the number of life foet uses was decreased in the 6-day-expo-
sure group when compared to controls. No changes were observed in foetal and 
placenta weight288. It is noted that blood alcohol levels were very low, and no 
explanation for these low levels could be found. In the same paper, however, an intraperitoneal injection of 4 g/kg bw ethanol was reported to result in a blood alcohol level of ca. 5500 mg/l 5 min after injection which decreased to ca. 2300 
mg/l at 180 min, indicating that the m easurement method seemed to be correct. 
However, since no data were reported on maternal toxicity, these data cannot be properly used to evaluate  developmental toxicity.
Whole body exposure of pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats (15 rats/group) to 
0, 10,000, 16,000 or 20,000 ppm et hanol (19,000, 30,400 or 38,000 mg/m
3, 
respectively) for 7 h/day throughout gestation days 1-19 did not result in changes 
in the offspring (sacrificed on day 20), i.e. no skeletal and visceral defects were 
observed and no changes in the number of  implantations, resorptions and foetal 
body weight were seen. Dams exposed to 20,000 ppm were narcotised by the end of exposure and maternal weight gain and food intake were reduced during the first week of exposure. Reduced weight  gain during the first week was also 
observed in dams exposed to 16,000 ppm. Blood alcohol levels were measured in 
3 non-pregnant animals per group exposed for 1, 10 or 19 days. About 5 min after exposure cessation, animals were removed from the exposure chamber and 
blood was taken from the vena cava. Blood alcohol levels were between 10-44, 330-1100 and 900-2540 mg/l, for the low, mid, and high concentration, respectively
289.  
Male Sprague Dawley rats (18 rats/g roup) were exposed whole body to 0, 
10,000 or 16,000 ppm ethanol (19,000 or 30,400 mg/m3, respectively) 7 h/day 
for 6 weeks and after a two day non-exposure were mated with untreated females. Also pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats (15 rats/group) were 124 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)exposed to the same levels for 7 h/day throughout gestation (days 1-20). No 
changes were observed in body weights, and food and water intake of these males and females. The offspring of both paternally and maternally exposed rats 
did not show changes in number, body weig ht gain or in neuromotor coordina-
tion, activity or learning abil ity at the age of 16-58 days
286. There were, however, 
slight changes in neurochemical parameters observed at the age of 21 days287. 
Since these changes were not concentrati on-related and were often not consistent 
across brain regions, it is difficult to conclude about their toxicological signifi-cance. 
Oral studies
Exposure of pregnant C57BL/6J mice to 5.4 g ethanol/100 ml diet (30% of the 
calories were ethanol derived) during gestation days 5-11 resulted in delayed sexual maturation as measured by the time of vaginal opening in female off-spring, when compared to a normal fed control group an d a pair-fed sucrose con-
trol group. Histopathological examination of the vaginas of some of the animals revealed heterotropic vaginal epithelium
290. 
C57Bl/6J mice were fed a liquid diet in which 17, 25 or 30% of the calories 
were derived from ethanol during gestatio n days 5-10. [Based on the mean liquid 
intake and the mean body weight data, these dose levels correspond to ca. 15, 25 or 25 g/kg bw/day, respectively. It is noted that liquid diet intake of the 30% group was about 20% lower than that of the 25% group, which finally resulted in about the same intake per kg bw]. Contro l mice were fed normal diet or pair-fed 
identical diets except that sucrose substituted isocalor ically for ethanol. Blood 
samples were collected from satellite preg nant animals, also on the liquid diet, 
each morning at 8.00-9.00 AM on gesta tional days 6-11. Blood alcohol reached 
levels up to ca. 20, 260 and 380 mg% (200, 2600 and 3800 mg/l), for the 17, 25 and 30% groups, respectively. No chan ges in maternal body weights were 
observed (no further data on maternal toxicity were reported). At term (gestation day 19), foetuses were removed and exa mined. The incidence of foetal resorp-
tions and congenital malformations incr eased in a dose-related manner in ani-
mals of the 25 and 30% groups. Anomalies included skeletal, neurological, urogenital, and cardiovascular systems. Animals of the 17% group did not show any more anomalous offspring than its pair-fed control group
291. 
Pregnant C57Bl/6J mice were exposed by gastric intubation to 25% ethanol 
administered in two doses of 2.9 g/kg f our hours apart on gestation days 7 or 10, 
or in a single dose of 5.8 g/kg on gesta tion days 8 or 9. Mice were also exposed Effects in experimental animals 125to 25% ethanol by intraperitoneal injectio n (either two doses of 2.9 g/kg four 
hours on gestational days 7, 8, 9, or 10, or six hours apart on gestational days 7 or 
10). Blood samples were taken from the fi rst group treated by gastric intubation, 
and from both intraperiton eal groups 30 min after ( each) administration and at 
hourly intervals for the next 8-12 hours. Upon gastric intubation, 30 min after the 
first administration a highest blood alcohol level of ca. 3000 mg/l was obtained; 
30 min after the 2nd administration a highest level of ca. 4000 mg/l was reached. 
Upon intraperitoneal administration, matern al blood levels reached values of ca. 
4000 and 6000 mg/l, respectively. Mice were sacrificed on day 18 of gestation. The incidence of malformations varied  according to the stage of embryonic 
development at the time of exposure, the route of administration, and the amount of alcohol and the time period over which it was administered. Oral doses of 
alcohol were teratogenic although less so than the same dose given intraperito-
neally, and two intraperitoneal doses four hours apart produced significantly more malformations than the same two doses six hours apart
292.
Maternal mice were fed a liquid diet containing 20% ethanol-derived calories 
during pregnancy, pregnancy and lactation, or lactation. Ad libitum-fed and pair-
fed control groups, fed a control liquid diet, were included. Blood samples were 
taken on day 12 of pregnancy and day 11 of lactation at 8 PM (2 hours after 
lights off). On day 12 of pregnancy average blood alcohol levels were 290-530 mg/l whereas on day 11 of lactation levels were about 2480-2950 mg/l. Ethanol exposure reduced the number of splenic lymphocytes and altered the phenotypic development of these cells of offspring reared by these anim als. The greatest 
effect occurred when females consumed ethanol during the period of lactation. 
The authors suggested that direct exposure  of the nursing offspring to ethanol via 
the breast milk was responsible
293. 
Ethanol containing liquid diet (30% of daily caloric intake) was administered to 
pregnant albino rats (strain not specified) on gestation days 1-10. The control group received isocaloric su crose-liquid diet. At term  the animals were sacri-
ficed. Blood alcohol concentrations were reported to be ca. 190 mg% (1900     
mg/l) [no further details were given]. Foetal changes consisted of prenatal 
growth retardation, resorption and still births, cleft palate, hydrocephaly and low-ered brain weights, hydronephrosis, and limb and joint defects
294. Since no data 
were reported on maternal toxicity, thes e data cannot be properly used to evalu-
ate developmental toxicity.126 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)In their evaluation, the Committee on Alcohol consumption and Reproduction 
described studies of Bonthius et al. , Kelly et al. , Pierce et al.  and West et al.295-
301. These animal studies showed that prenat al exposure to ethanol during the tri-
mester of pregnancy which is comparable  to the third trimester of human preg-
nancy, might result in microencephaly or decreased brain weight. This effect 
seems to be best correlated to the maxi mal alcohol concentration in blood    
(BACmax) and not to the total exposure (AUC).
7.7 Summary and evaluation
The lowest lethal dose by inhalation is 55,100 mg/m3 (29,000 ppm) in mice (7-h 
exposure) and 24,130 mg/m3 (12,700 ppm) in rats (22 hours). In one study 
behavioural depression occurred in rats inhaling 384 mg/m3 (202 ppm) for 45 
minutes, although the rats developed tolerance after two days in a similar expo-sure scenario, and there was no effect on  the reinforcement ra te by exposure to 
384 mg/m
3 (202 ppm) for 80 minutes. The lowest reported lethal dermal dose for 
rabbits is 20 g/kg bw. In rabbits acute occluded exposure to 95% ethanol caused 
mild irritation. 96% ethanol is mildly irritating to the eyes of the rabbit. 
In the studies with repeated inhalation  exposure, only one concentration of 
ethanol was tested and only specific en dpoints were studied, rendering these 
studies not appropriate to establish hea lth-based occupational exposure limits. 
From these data, however, it was concluded that at the low concentration of 86 
mg/m3 no changes were observed, whereas at the high levels used in the other 
two studies ( i.e. resulting in blood alcohol concentrations > 1700 mg/l), only 
slight toxicity was observed.   
After repeated oral adminis tration, ethanol appears to affect all organs with 
the liver as main target organ. Increased  hepatic concentrations of fatty acid and 
triglycerids were observed after a 30-day  administration of a liquid diet contain-
ing 33% of the calories as ethanol . 
No long-term inhalation studies have been found and the results from long-term 
oral exposure studies were inconclusive. Overall, the results from these experi-
ments were not conclusive: Tumour incide nces were increased in male Sprague 
Dawley rats upon chronic intake of ethanol-containing drinking water, but not in male and female rats of the same strain upon oral intake of ethanol through a liq-uid diet. A drinking water st udy in mice was also negati ve. Because in all three 
studies the MTD (maximal tolerated do se) was not reached, these studies are 
inadequate to evaluate the carci nogenic potential of ethanol. Effects in experimental animals 127Ethanol is probably not mutagenic in bacteria. In most in vitro test with mamma-
lian cells, ethanol was negative as well. Only a minority of the in vivo micronu-cleus tests is positive. There is, howeve r, some evidence that ethanol induces 
SCE in vivo. Further, ethanol induces aneuploidy in male and female mouse germ cells. Finally, ethanol was positive in several, but not all, dominant lethal 
assays in the rat and mouse.
The Committee on the Evaluation of the carcinogenicity of chemical sub-
stances concluded that a lot of informa tion is available regarding the genotoxic 
properties of ethanol. In a minority of the in vivo  and in vitro  genotoxicity tests 
(other than aneuploidy), ethanol was positive. Most genotoxicity tests were nega-tive after treatment with ethanol. Therefore, based on the genotoxicity tests they conclude that there is only limited evid ence for a genotoxic potential of ethanol. 
However, acetaldehyde, a genotoxic comp ound, is one of the major metabolites 
of ethanol and (allthough in limited studies) low concen trations of aceetaldehyde 
has been detected in the human body after ingestion of ethanol. As a role for ace-taldehyde in the genotoxicity of ethanol  cannot be excluded, the committee can-
not neglect the few positive results in the genotoxicity test.
Inhalation exposure of rats to concentrations up to 30,400 mg/m
3 ethanol (16,000 
ppm) resulting in blood alcohol levels of about 500 mg/l, did not result in changes in male fertility. Oral intake of high amounts of ethanol (ca. 10 g etha-nol/kg bw/day or higher), in contrast, resu lted in decreased reproductive perfor-
mance, decreased serum testosterone le vels, decreased testicular weight and 
testicular atrophy in rats. An oral study in male mice at levels up to 0.6 g ethanol/
kg bw/day) did not influence mating behaviour and success. Other studies into 
the fertility effects of ethanol have shown that oral intake of high ethanol doses (> 2 g/kg bw/day) before and during pregnancy had no influence on mating behaviour of females.  
Exposure of female rats by inhalation dur ing pregnancy up to concentrations of 
20,000 ppm (38,000 mg/m
3) ethanol, resulting in blood alcohol levels up to 
about 2500 mg/l, did not result in developmental toxicity although maternal 
toxicity was observed. Exposure of male rats to concentrations up to 16,000 ppm (30,400 mg/m
3) did not show changes in paternal offspring. Teratogenic effects, 
however, were observed in rats and mice following oral intake of large amounts of ethanol during pregnancy, resulting in blood alcohol levels of about 2000-6000 mg/l. No teratogenic effects were observed in mice after oral intake of 
ethanol resulting in blood alcohol levels of about 200 mg/l. Several animal 128 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)studies showed that prenatal exposure to ethanol, might result in microencephaly 
or decreased brain weight. Th is effect seemed to be best correlated to the maxi-
mal alcohol concentr ation in blood (BACmax) and not to the total exposure 
(AUC).Existing guidelines, standards and evaluations 1298 Chapter

evaluations
8.1 General population
No guidelines were found for the general population covering the inhalation or 
dermal exposure to ethanol. 
In 1995, a UK report of an inter-de partmental working group on sensible 
drinking3 recommended a maximum oral intake of 3 units (8 grams of ethanol/
unit) per day for women, with 1-2 units giving the maximum health advantage. For men, the corresponding recommendations were drinking not more than 4 units/day to avoid adverse health effect s, with 1-2 units/day as the optimal 
amount. 
The WHO acknowledged epidemiological  reports which “have found evi-
dence of a protective effect of levels of  drinking as low as one drink per week” 
(no defined unit concentration), but advise d that any beneficial health effects 
should be sought by other means due to the overwhelming number of adverse effects
302. The 2001, WHO Global St atus Report on Alcohol302 stated that practi-
cally no organ in the body is immune from alcohol related harm. Intake can lead to ethanol toxicity, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, alcoholic polyneuropathy etc. Although large-scale epidemiology studies have found evi-
dence of a protective effect of as little as  one drink per week, this is relevant only 
in populations where low levels of drinking are the norm. WHO has therefore no recommended intake threshold.130 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)8.2 Working population
International occupational exposure standards in mg/m3 (ppm) as Time-
Weighted Averages for 8-hr exposure (TWA) are summarised in Table 8.1.
In the Netherlands, the Health Council’s committee Compounds toxic to repro-
duction classified ethanol in category 1 (accordi ng to EU guidelines) for its 
effects on fertility and development ( Substances known to impair fertility in 
humans, substances known to cause developmental toxicity in humans ). For its 
effects on lactation, the committee r ecommended to label ethanol with R64 ( may 
cause harm to breastfed babies ). 
The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) re-evaluated ethanol in 19981. It 
concluded that the critical effects of o ccupational exposure are an increased risk 
of certain forms of cancer. It is stressed in  the assessment that there are so far no 
studies linking a possible carcinogen effect and occupational exposure by inhala-tion. However, it has been shown in humans that the chronic oral intake of etha-nol increases the risk of tumours in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, Table 8.1   International occupational ex posure standards for ethanol.

dehyde and other genotoxic, reactive meta bolites of ethanol. Assuming linear 
kinetics, the amount of metabolites will in crease proportionally with the intake of 
ethanol with no apparent threshold limi t of carcinogen effect. The occupational 
exposure should therefore be kept to a mi nimum, to ensure that the internal expo-
sure due to lifetime endogenous ethanol exposure will not be significantly 
increased. The Area Under the Curve (AUC ) parameter (time versus BAC) can 
be employed to assess whether a given inhalatory exposure pattern will cause a significant increase in the BAC (compared to the endogenous BAC) and conse-quently in the carcinogenic risk. On this basis, ethanol was assigned to category 
5: the carcinogenic potential is so low that the MAK value (500 ppm) will not represent an unacceptable risk level, as the resulting occupa tional exposure will 
lie within the standard deviation of the endogenous level. 
For acute exposure ethanol was classifi ed to category II,2 in 2001, limiting 
the acute exposure to 2500 ppm, 30 min, 2 times per shift. This is due to the short half-life and rapid resorption. Due to ge notoxic effects ethanol is considered a 
group 2 substance (the substance is show n to be genotoxic in studies performed 
on mammals). Adverse reproduction effects are seen in humans and animals only 
at high concentrations of exposure, justifying a classification in group C (no need 
for concern at exposure levels at/lower than the MAK level). No threshold was 
found for teratogenic effects, but the German MAK-committee concluded that 
effects were observed at an intake in excess of 30 g/day for pregnant women, after careful assessment of the availabl e data. It was not deemed necessary to 
give ethanol a skin-notation. 
The scientific basis for Swedish occupational standards is set by the Swedish 
National Institute of Occupational Health. It  concluded that the critical effects on 
occupational exposure to ethanol vapour is irritation of mucous membranes. The 
assessment stressed that there were no inhalation studies on the mutagenic/geno-toxic and carcinogenic effects of ethanol , but registered that IARC considered 
that there was “sufficient evidence” that  acetaldehyde is carcinogenic to experi-
mental animals, and that drinks contai ning alcohol are carcinogenic to humans. 
Some animal inhalation studies have shown teratogenic effects, while repeated intake of ethanol by mothers during gestation has also been shown to damage human foetuses
141. 
IARC172 considered there was sufficient ev idence to classify the major metabo-
lite of ethanol, acetaldehyde, as a carci nogen in experimental animals. However, 132 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)there was inadequate evidence for the carci nogenicity of ethanol in experimental 
animals. IARC found suffic ient evidence for the car cinogenicity of alcoholic 
beverages in humans (Group 1), and a causal relation between consumption of alcoholic beverages and the occurrence of malignant tumours of the oral cavity, 
pharynx, larynx, oesophagus and liver. In most of the evaluated studies ethanol was administered orally.
ACGIH
307 recommended a TLV-TWA of 1000 ppm, based on the lack of eye and 
upper respiratory tract irritation at levels below 5000 ppm and on long industrial hygiene experience with human exposures to ethanol. The designation A4, Not Classifiable as a Human Carcinogen, was a ssigned due to the lack of animal data 
addressing the carcinogenicity of ethanol. No STEL will be recommended until 
sufficient toxicological data and industrial hygiene experience is available. Data 
used in the assessment show that the acute toxicity is low for animals and 
humans, although low concentrations will be irritating to the upper respiratory tract and eyes. This effect was deemed more important in setting the limit than 
secondary toxic effect s of absorbed ethanol
310. 
In the OSHA (Occupational Safety & Heal th Administration) classification sys-
tem of health effects, ethanol was listed  as HE14 (marked irritation in the eye, 
nose, throat and on the skin), HE8 (ner vous system disturbance: narcosis) and 
HE5 (reproduction hazard: reproductive impairment)16.Hazard assessment 1339 Chapter
Hazard assessment
9.1 Assessment of health hazard
In this report DECOS evaluates the health effects of inhalatory and dermal occu-
pational exposure to ethanol. The comm ittee acknowledges that drinking alco-
holic beverages may be a more important source of ethanol exposure for 
workers. However, DECOS l eaves this outside work ex posure out of consider-
ation for the assessment of the health ef fects after occupational exposure to etha-
nol. 
Furthermore, several epid emiological studies report ed that for the overall 
mortality, the dose-effect curve for long-term exposure to ethanol appears to be U- or J-shaped, indi cating beneficial effects. At lo w exposure levels, these bene-
ficial effects are for instance a reduced risk of coronary h eart disease. DECOS 
does also not take these beneficial eff ects of ethano l into account for a quantita-
tive health assessment after occupational exposure. 
9.1.1 Health effects after single of short-term exposure
Only a few human studies on effects of short-term inhalatory exposure to ethanol 
are available. DECOS is of the opinion that these data indicate that inhalatory 
exposure for one hour to concentrations below 1900 mg/m3 ethanol (1000 ppm) 
will not cause local or systemic effects.  Therefore, DECOS considers 1900      134 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)mg/m3 as a NOAEL for short term exposure (15 minutes). Exposure to concen-
trations 3000 mg/m3 for 30 minutes might result in minimal effects as transient 
cough, dry throat, tickling in the nose et c. A sudden increase in ethanol concen-
tration (from 0 mg/m3 to levels up to ~4000 mg/m3) may cause temporary irrita-
tion, whereas a concentration of 17000 mg/m3 ethanol is described as 
‘intolerable’ for unacclimatized persons.
9.1.2 Health effects after repeated exposure
There are no human data available concer ning the effects of ethanol after long-
term inhalatory  exposure. Most data on the eff ects of long-term exposure to eth-
anol concern the oral consumption of al coholic beverages. These epidemiologi-
cal studies have several limitations. • The alcohol consumption is expressed as average amount per day, leaving the 
pattern of alcohol consumption out of consideration ( binge drinking vs regu-
lar consumption ). 
• The studies may be subject to recall bi as, selection bias and information bias. 
For example, the validity of self-reported alcohol consumption has been a 
subject of much discussion. The general finding is that the alcohol consump-tion is underreported. 
• Confounding factors seem to be smoking,  age and other lifestyle factors.  
The above mentioned limitations will have influenced the results in the epidemi-
ological studies in different directions. All together, DECOS is of the opinion the 
effects of these limitations on the dose-e ffect relationship will probably counter-
act each other.  
Furthermore, the kinetics after drinking  alcoholic beverages differs from the 
kinetics after inhalatory  exposure  to ethanol. On the one hand, more than 90% of 
the orally ingested ethanol is absorbed wi th a high rate. After oral absorption, the 
blood ethanol concentration (BAC) peaks during the first hour and decreases with a short half life (at low ethanol exposure) thereafter. On the other hand, there are only limited data available con cerning the absorption of ethanol after 
inhalatory exposure. Absorption of ethano l by the lungs is relatively low, ~60%. 
Physical activity will increase the inhalato ry absorption. Inhalatory exposure to 
1900 mg/m
3 results in a maximal blood alcohol concentration 10 to 100 times 
lower than the maximal blood ethanol con centration after drin king one alcoholic 
beverage. For the risk assessment of inhalatory exposure to ethanol, DECOS is therefore of the opinion that studies concerning oral exposure will overestimate Hazard assessment 135those effects which are related to the maximal blood ethanol level ( eg several 
reproduction toxic effects295-301). 
However, for genotoxic carcinogens (compounds without a NOAEL), 
DECOS generally assumes that the total in ternal exposure, ie. the Area Under the 
Curve (AUC defined as BAC times the expos ure time) is a more relevant health 
exposure estimate. The AUC after drinking one glass of beer (containing ~11 g 
ethanol) is in the same order of magnitude as the AUC after eight hour inhalatory 
exposure to 1900 mg/m3.311 Therefore, DECOS is of the opinion that the oral 
carcinogenicity studies have limitations but can be used for the risk assessment 
of inhalatory exposure to ethanol.    
The blood ethanol concentration will de pend on several factors, like gender, 
age and genetic predisposition. Genetic predisposition plays a role because many 
isoenzymes and polymorphisms exist in ethanol metabolising enzymes, which 
results in different metabolic rates betw een racial and ethni c groups. Habitual 
alcoholic beverage consumpt ion is important because ethanol exposure leads to 
induction of metabolizing enzymes. Overall, many different ethanol metaboliz-ing enzyme systems exist which result in  a large ethanol elimination capacity. A 
healthy subject is considered to eliminate between maximally 6 and 9 g of pure 
ethanol per hour.
In 1988, IARC concluded that there is sufficient evidence in humans showing 
that drinking alcoholic beverages is causally  related to different types of cancer, 
such as malignant liver tumors and malignant tumors of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and oesophagus
172. 
More recently, a meta-analysi s of Ellisson et al, 2001180 and pooled studies of 
Smith Warner et al. , 1998 and Beral et al. , 2002181,182 showed that there is suffi-
cient evidence in humans for an almost lin ear dose response association for etha-
nol and breast cancer. The risk for breast cancer linearly incr eases with 7-10% 
(RR 1.1) for every 10 grams of ethanol consumed. The risk for breast cancer in 
men after alcohol consumpti on is insufficiently investigated. A recent case con-
trol study183 found a relative risk of breast can cer in men which is comparable to 
that in women. 
The Committee on the Evaluation of car cinogenic compounds of the Health 
Council of the Netherlands concluded that it can not be excluded that acetalde-hyde, a major (genotoxic) metabolite of ethanol, plays a role in the genotoxicity of ethanol, due to the few positive results in the genotoxicity tests (see Annex E). The Committee on the Evaluation of carcinogenic compounds is therefore of the 
opinion that ethanol is carcinogenic to humans and should be considered as a 136 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)(stochastic) genotoxic agent (as a worst case approach). In addition, the commit-
tee concludes that ethanol is known to be carcinogenic to humans (comparable with EU-category 1).   
Several epidemiological studies
159,169,170 showed that drinking alcoholic bever-
ages causes liver cirrhosis even at lo w alcohol concentrations (>18-30 g/day). 
DECOS concludes that 10 gram of ethanol per day seems to be a threshold for 
liver damage and assumes that these effects will be less relevant after inhalatory exposure as the first path metabolism plays no role after inhalatory exposure to ethanol. 
The Committee on Alcohol consumptio n and reproduction of the Health 
Council of the Netherlands concluded that th ere is evidence that an intake of less 
than 10 grams of ethanol (one alcoholic consumption) per day may have an 
adverse effect on reproduction (decreased  male and female fertility, increased 
incidence of spontaneous abortion, foet al death, preterm delivery, decreased 
length of gestation). 
9.2 Quantitative hazard assessment
9.2.1 Recommendation of an HBROEL, twa 15  min (Short-term Exposure Limit, STEL)
Concerning the recommendation of a STEL,  DECOS is of the opinion that the 
available human data are limited but indicate that short-term inhalation of con-centrations up to 1900 mg/m
3 ethanol (1000 ppm) for one hour will not cause 
local or systemic effects. Inhalatory ex posure for 30 minutes to concentrations 
higher that 3000 mg/m3 will cause minimal effects such as transient cough and 
dry throat, whereas exposure to 17000 mg/m3 is described as intolerable for non-
acclimized persons. Therefore,  the committee is of the opinion that a short term Table 9.1   Effects of long-term oral exposure to low doses of ethanol in humans.

workers against effects of  short-term exposure. 
9.2.2 Recommendation of a Health Based Calculated Occupational Cancer Risk Value 
(HBC-OCRV)
DECOS considers the devel opment of breast cancer in women after exposure to 
ethanol as the critical effect. Based on  the advice of the Health Council’s Com-
mittee on the Evaluation of carcinogenic substances th at a genotoxic mechanism 
cannot be excluded, DECOS recommends calculating of so called health based 
calculated occupational cancer risk va lues (HBC-OCRV) for ethanol. For the 
establishment of the HBC-OCRV’s, the co mmittee generally uses a linear extrap-
olation method, as described in the committee’s report ‘Calculating cancer risk due to occupational exposure to genotoxic carcinogens’
312. The linear model to 
calculate occupational cancer risks is used  as a default worst case model, unless 
scientific data would indicate that using this model is not appropriate. 
From the meta-analysis of Ellisson et al. , 2001, and the pooled studies of 
Smith Warner et al. , 1998 and Beral et al. , 2002, DECOS concludes that drinking 
a glass of alcoholic beverage (~10 gram ethanol) per day would increase the risk for breast cancer linearly  with 7-10% (RR 1.1). 
From these data, DECOS estimates the following HBR-OCRV
* (see Annex D):
•4×10-5 for 40 years of occupational exposure to 13 mg/m3 
•4×10-3 for 40 years of occupational exposure to 1300 mg/m3.
Ethanol is present in the human body without drinking alcoholic beverages as 
well. The endogenous ethanol concentration in human blood amounts to 0.27 ( ± 
0.17) mg/l, corresponding to an AUC for 80 years of 21.6 ( ± 13.6) (mg/l) ×year. 
 DECOS calculates that occupational exposure to 150, 750 or 1500 mg etha-
nol/m3 for 40 years (8 hours/day, 5 days/week, 48 weeks/year) might result in 
AUCs of 2.0, 7.5, 19.2 (mg/l) ×year, respectively (see Annex D). From these data, 
the committee estimates that an occupational exposure of 13 mg/m3 (correspond-
ing to a extra cancer risk of 4 ×10-5) results in an AUC of approximately 0.2    
(mg/l)×year. 
The committee conclude s that the additional AUC (0 .2 mg/l per year) as a 
result of occupational exposure to 13 mg/m3 is negligible to the AUC from the 
lifetime endogenous ethanol concentration in blood (~22 mg/l ×year). Conse-
* Assuming a lung retention of 60% and that 10 m3 air is inhaled per 8-hour working day.138 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)quently, the committee c onsiders the relevance of the calculation of an HBC-
OCRV corresponding to a risk of 4 ×10-5 doubtful. 
Therefore, DECOS r ecommends an HBC-OCRV corr esponding to a breast can-
cer risk in women of 4 additional death per 1000 deaths (4 ×10-3) for 40 years of 
occupational exposure to 1300 mg/m3. 
The Committee on Alcohol consumption and reproduction concluded that 
first signs of developmental toxicity and effects on fertility may become manifest after drinking one alcoholic consumption per day or less (<10 gram ethanol per day). However, DECOS is of the opinion that the maximal blood alcohol concen-tration is probably the relevant exposure  parameter for these toxic effects. The 
BAC
max after one (oral) drink is approxima tely 10-100 times higher than the 
BACmax after inhalatory exposure to 1300 mg/m3. Therefore, the committee is of 
the opinion that at an exposure level of 1300 mg/m3, developmental toxicity and 
effects on fertility will probably not occur.
9.3 Skin notation
From the available data, DECOS is of the opinion that dermal exposure might 
occur in the occupational setting. Ther efore, the DECOS estimates whether a 
skin notation might be appropriate for ethanol (see Annex F). 
A skin notation is consid ered when exposure of two hands and forearms ( i.e. 
2000 cm2 of the skin) to ethanol during one hour leads to an additional uptake of 
10% of the maximal inhalatory uptake as a results of exposure to the HBC-
OCRV of 1300 mg/m3 during an 8-hour working day.
From the calculation in Annex F, DECOS concludes (as a worst case 
approach) that a skin notation should be applied for ethanol.
Risk assessment of ethanol used as an desinfectant
For the specified occupational situation that a (hospital) worker desinfects both 
hands and underarms by washing with ethanol once, DECOS estimates (worst 
case) that under these (non-occlusive) conditions the dermal uptake will be 30 mg ethanol (see Annex F)
*. Consequently, when hands will be desinfected with 
ethanol 20 times per day, this results in an dermal uptake of approximately 600 mg/day. This is less than 10% of the uptake caused by an 8 hours inhalatory eth-
anol exposure to the HBCOCRV of 1300 mg/m
3 (7800 mg/day).   
* Washing hands only (400-800 cm2 in stead of 2000 cm2) will decrease the dermal uptake. Hazard assessment 1399.4 Groups at extra risk
Ethanol is known to induce the cytochrome  P450IIE1 enzyme. This enzyme is a 
major catalyst of a number of substances  of low molecular weight, among which 
are suspected carcinogens313,314. In specific cases, non-toxic doses of those sub-
stances may give rise to adverse effects due to increased bioactivation. Hence, 
workers who have co-exposure to ethanol and other chemicals that are activated 
by P450IIE1, may have a higher risk fo r adverse effects induced by these chemi-
cals. This aspect was beyond the scope of the present report and is therefore not 
further discussed. 
Furthermore, as presente d in chapter 5, polymorphism of enzymes relevant 
for the biotransformation of ethanol exists. The results are difficult to interpret in a quantitative way for possible consequen ces for standard setting. Some effects 
related to ethanol exposure may also be related to the parent compound (ethanol itself) or a metabolite ( e.g. acetaldehyde). The final result of a polymorphism 
may be completely the opposite, depending on whether the parent compound or a 
metabolite is responsible for th e effects under consideration.
9.5 Health based calculated occupational cancer risk value and short-
term exposure limit
DECOS recommends a short-term exposure limit (STEL) of 1900 mg/m3, twa 15 
minutes. 
Based on an advice of the Committee on the evaluation fo carcinogenic com-
pounds, DECOS concludes that ethanol is known to be carcinogenic to humans (comparble with EU category 1) and should be considered a genotoxic agent. 
In addition, DECOS derives an HBC-OC RV corresponding to a breast cancer 
risk in women of 4 additional death cases per 1000 (4 ×10
-3) death cases for 40 
years of occupational exposure to 1300 mg/m3.
Finally, DECOS recommends a skin notation.
9.6 Recommendations for research
• Mechanistic research to discriminate be tween the effects in duced by ethanol 
and its metabolite acetaldehyde: is ethanol really a genotoxic agent?
• Modelling as a tool for extrapolation of oral toxicity data to inhalation.• Appropriate inhalatory repeated  dose experiments in animals.140 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)References 141References

Request for advice
In a letter dated October 11, 1993, ref DGA/G/TOS/93/07732A, to, the State 
Secretary of Welfare, Health  and Cultural Affairs, the Minister of Social Affairs 
and Employment wrote:
Some time ago a policy proposal has been formulated , as part of the simplification of the governmen-
tal advisory structure, to  improve the integr ation of the develo pment of recommendations for health 
based occupation standards and the development of comparable standards for the general population. 
A consequence of this policy pro posal is the initiative to transfer the activities of the Dutch Expert 
Committee on Occupational Standards (DECOS) to th e Health Council. DECOS has been established 
by ministerial decree of 2 June 1976. Its primary task is to recommend he alth based occupational 
exposure limits as the first step  in the process of establishing  Maximal Accepted Concentrations 
(MAC-values) for substances at the work place. 
In an addendum, the Minister detailed his request to the Health Council as fol-
lows:
The Health Council should advice the Minister of  Social Affairs and Employment on the hygienic 
aspects of his policy to protect workers against ex posure to chemicals. Pr imarily, the Council should 
report on health based recommende d exposure limits as a basis for (reg ulatory) exposure limits for air 
quality at the work place. This implies:• A scientific evaluation of all relevant data on th e health effects of exposure to substances using a 
criteria-document that will be made available to th e Health Council as part of a specific request 164 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)for advice. If possible this evaluation should le ad to a health based recommended exposure limit, 
or, in the case of genotoxic carcinogens, a 'exposu re versus tumour incidence range' and a calcu-
lated concentration in air corresponding with reference tumour incidences of 10-4 and 10-6 per 
year.
• The evaluation of documents review the basis of  occupational exposure limits that have been 
recently established in other countries.
• Recommending classifications for substances as part of the occu pational hygiene policy of the 
government. In any case this rega rds the list of carcinogenic subs tances, for which the classifica-
tion criteria of the Directive of  the European Communities of 27  June 1967 (67/ 548/EEG) are 
used.
• Reporting on other subjects that w ill be specified at a later date.
In his letter of 14 December 1993, ref U 6102/WP/MK/459, to the Minister of 
Social Affairs and Employmen t the President of the H ealth Council agreed to 
establish DECOS as a Committee of the Health Council. The membership of the Committee is given in annex B.The committee 165B Annex

The Health Council and interestsMembers of Health Council Committees are appointed in a personal capacity 
because of their special expertise in the ma tters to be addressed. Nonetheless, it 
is precisely because of this expertise that  they may also have interests. This in 
itself does not necessarily present an obstacle for membership of a Health Coun-
cil Committee. Transparency regarding po ssible conflicts of interest is nonethe-
less important, both for the President an d members of a Committee and for the 
President of the Health Council. On being invited to join a Committee, members are asked to submit a form detailing the functions they hold and any other mate-
rial and immaterial interests which could be relevant for the Committee’s work. 
It is the responsibility of the President of the Health Council to assess whether the interests indicated constitute grounds for non-appointment. An advisorship will then sometimes make it possible to exploit the expertise of the specialist involved. During the establishment meeting the declarations issued are dis-cussed, so that all members of the Comm ittee are aware of each other’s possible 
interests.Comments on the public draft 167C Annex

Derivation of HBC-OCRV* and 
comparison with the endogenous 
ethanol levels in blood
D.1 Derivation of the Health based calculated occupational cancer risk 
values (HBC-OCRV)
For the establishment of the HBC-OCRV’s , the committee generally uses a linear 
extrapolation method, as described in the committee’s report ‘Calculating cancer 
risk due to occupational exposure to genotoxic carcinogens’312. The linear model 
to calculate occupational cancer risks is  used as a default worst case model, 
unless scientific data would indicate that using this model is not appropriate.  
From the studies of Smith-Warner et al.  (1998)181, Beral et al.  (2002)182 and 
Ellisson et al.  (2001)180, DECOS concluded that drin king one glass of alcohol 
beverage (~10 gram ethanol) per day wi ll increase the risk for breast cancer in 
women with 7-10%. This correspond s approximately to a RR of 1.1. 
The dose response relationship will incr ease linearly per unit dose of ethanol 
up to 30 g/day, resulting in the following equation:
RR = a x exposure (g/day) + 1
Because the RR is 1.1 at an exposure (dose)  of 10 gram of etha nol, it can be cal-
culated that a=0.01, resulting in the following dose-respons relationship:
* health based calculated occupational cancer risk values170 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)RR = 0.01 x exposure (g/day) + 1
Furthermore, the excess lifetime cancer ri sk depends on the background rate of 
breast cancer (in women). In the Netherland s, 12.5 per 250 deat h cases (per year) 
in the female population are from breast cancer (CBS 2003, Statline). 
One extra death (12.5 +1) per 250 deaths  due to breast cancer (corresponding 
to an additional risk of 4 ×10-3) as a result of drinking one alcoholic beverage will 
therefore correspond to a RR of 1.08 ((12.5+1)/12.5). 
From the dose-response relationship above, the committee calculates that a 
RR of 1.08 corresponds to an exposure of 8000 mg per day*. 
In addition, DECOS assumes that for genotoxic carcinogens the AUC (blood 
alcohol concentratio n times exposure time) is the exposure estimate associated 
with the health effect . Furthermore, from the study of Campbell et al.51, DECOS 
concluded that the AUC after drinking one glass of alcohol (~10000 mg ethanol) is comparable with the AUC after inhalatory exposure to 1900 mg/m
3 for 8 
hours. Therefore, DECOS is of the opinion that it is relevant  to extrapolate an 
oral uptake of 8000 mg ethanol per day (res ulting in one extra death due to breast 
cancer per 250 death cases), to an inhala tory exposure to ethanol during 8 hours. 
Assuming that 10 m3 air is inhaled per working day (8 hours) and the lung 
retention is 60%, DECOS calculates that an oral dose of 8000 mg per day corre-sponds to an inhalatory dose of 1300 mg/m
3 (8000 mg/(10*0.6)). Moreover, 
DECOS assumes that both exposures will result in comparable AUC’s.
In conclusion, DECOS calculates the following HBR-OCRVs:
•4×10-5 for 40 years of occupational exposure to 13 mg/m3 
•4×10-3 for 40 years of occupational exposure to 1300 mg/m3.
D.2 Comparison of the HBC-OCRV with the endogens ethanol levels in 
blood
Ethanol is present in the human body of non-drinkers as well. Sprung et al.19, 
measured a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) for endogenous ethanol of 0.27 mg/l (± 0.17 mg/l). This correspond to an AUC (Area under the curve, ie BAC × 
exposure time for 80 years, 24 hours/day) of 21.6 ±13.6 (mg/l) ×year (0.27 mg/l × 
80 year). 
* Assuming that the RR for breast cancer in women is co mparable to the RR for de ath caused by breast cancer.Derivation of HBC-OCRV and comparison with the endogenous ethanol levels in blood 171Furthermore, Seeber et al.52 exposed 12 men and 12 women to ethanol (150, 750, 
1500 mg/m3) during 4 hours and determined the corresponding maximal blood 
alcohol concentrations (BACmax). The following ethanol concentrations were 
measured in the human blood: 0.23 mg/l, 0.85 mg/l, 2,18 mg/l, respectively. 
Using these BAC’s, the committee calculates the corresponding AUCs* for 40 
years.
From this table, DECOS estimates that an occupational exposure of 13 mg/m3 
(corresponding to a extra cancer risk of 4 ×10-5) results in an AUC of approxi-
mately 0.2 (mg/l) ×year. An occupational exposure to 1300 mg/m3 (correspond-
ing to an extra cancer risk of 4 ×10-3) results in an AUC of approximately 19 
(mg/l)×year.Exposure ( measured ) BAC ( calculated ) AUC for 80 years, 24 hours/day, 7 days/

Advice of the Committee on the 
evaluation of the carcinogenicity 
of chemical substances
concerning the genotoxic properti es of ethanol (September 2004)
E.1 Scope
The Committee on the evaluation of the carcinogenicity of chemical substances 
(further referred to as ‘the committee’) of the Health Counci l of the Netherlands 
has been asked by the Dutch Expert Committee on Occupational Standards 
(DECOS) to advise on two questions.
• Does the committee agree with DECOS’ conclusion that sufficient evidence 
in humans is available to conclude that oral exposure to ethanol increases the 
incidence of breast cancer in women?
• What is the committee’s conclusion regarding the genotoxic properties of 
ethanol. 
E.2 Does oral exposure to ethanol cause an increased incidence of 
breast cancer in women?
Carcinogenicity
In 1988, IARC concluded that adequate evidence in humans exists to show that 
drinking of ethanol is causally related to  malignant liver tumours. Furthermore, 
IARC was of the opinion that malignant tumors of the oral cavity, pharynx, lar-ynx and oesophagus are causally related to the consumption of ethanol as well. With respect to breast cancer, IARC was of  the opinion that “The modest eleva-174 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)tion in relative risk that has been observe d is potentially impo rtant because of the 
high incidence of breast cancer in many countries. Although the available data indicate a positive association between drinking of alcoholic beverages and breast cancer in women, a fi rm conclusion about a causal relationship cannot be 
made at present
*.”  Numerous studies have been performed on the effects of 
drinking alcohol on breast cancer since then. However, several methodological 
problems (lack of reporting of other br east cancer risk factor, difficulties in 
assessing the levels of consumed alcoho l etc) complicate interpretation of many 
of these studies. The positive correlation found in some studies, could not be confirmed in others. Ther efore, the committee based her conclusions predomi-
nantly on the meta-analysis of Ellison et al.  (2001)
13, and the (pooled) studies of 
SmithWarner et al.  (1998)31 and Beral et al.  (2002)5 regarding the effects of 
drinking alcohol and breast cancer. 
The committee is of the opi nion that these reports13, 31, 5 summarize the data 
on the relation between drinking of al cohol and breast can cer adequately. The 
committee concludes that there is suffic ient evidence that alcohol consumption 
elevates the relative risk for breast cancer  in women linearly with 7 to 10% per 
each 10 gram ethanol (one dr ink contains about 10 grams). 
In addition, in experimental animals the (breast) tumor incidences are 
increased after oral exposure to ethanol34, 29.
Mechanisms of actionThe association between alcohol intake and the occurrence of breast cancer has 
been studied extensively in man. However, only limited information is available 
concerning the possible mechanism of ac tion for this effect. Although progress 
has been made in understanding potential mechanisms, it is yet not clear how alcohol intake may increase breast cancer ri sk. Some studies implicate a role for 
endogenous hormones, while others suggested a role for genetic polymorphisms.
Endogenous hormones
• Alternation in estrogen  levels has been thought to modulate the breast cancer 
risk in women. Several studies show a positive correlation between alcohol 
intake and increased (plasma or urinary) estrogen levels
18. However, this 
* In 2003, IARC placed alcohol beverages on the  Priority List of agents and expo sures to consider in future IARC 
Monographs  because of new info rmation concerning ad ditional cancer sites ( breast , liver, colorectal cancer) and 
better knowledge of mechanisms of action.Advice of the Committee on the evaluation of the carcinogenicity of chemical substances 175association was not confirmed by others (cited from Smith-Warner31). More-
over, a few studies demonstrated that women with alcoholism have higher estrogen levels than moderate alcohol consumers and non drinkers
17. 
• Alternation in prolactin  levels has been associated with breast cancer risk in 
experimental animals36, 6. However, the hypothesis that prolactin might play 
a role in increasing the breast cancer risk is not supported convincingly by 
human data and more research should be performed10. Moreover, data 
regarding the effect of the intake of alcohol beverages on the prolactin levels are difficult to interpret. The influence of alcohol uptake on the prolactin lev-els seems highly dependent on, amongst other factors, the age and sexual maternity of the women and the mode of alcohol administration (acute or chronic ingestion).  
•Examples of other endogenous hormones which have been hypothesized to 
play a role in breast cancer development are androgens, thyroid hormones and estriol. However, the available data  are not convincing and more research 
is needed to elucidate a possible rela tionship between these hormones, etha-
nol ingestion and breast cancer. 
• There is evidence linking alcohol consumption to  p53-mutations (tumor sup-
pressor gene) in tumors and considerable evidence linking alcohol consump-
tion to  p53-mutations with risk to breast cancer
16. 
Genetic polymorphismsSeveral studies have suggested a role fo r genetic polymorphisms in the alcohol/
breast cancer association. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), Cytochrome P450 
2E1 (CYP2E1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH)  are considered to be 
important for detoxifying many carcinogenic compounds. Data suggest that the breast cancer risk is elevated among th ose who carry susceptible GST genotypes 
(GSTM1A, GSTT1-null) (Zheng et al. , 2003)
35. In addition, premenopausal 
women with certain genotypes of ALDH drinking ethanol had higher risk for 
breast cancer than other women15. Moreover, genotypes of CYP2E1 have been 
identified which are less  inducible than others25, 28.
ConclusionThe committee is of the opinion that th e available data provide potential explana-
tions for a relationship between ethanol intake and breast cancer but do no allow 
any definite conclusions. To elucidate the role of ethanol ingestion in the 
increased breast cancer development,  more research is needed.  176 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)E.3 Is ethanol a genotoxic carcinogen? 
Introduction
In the previous paragraphs, the commit tee discussed different postulated mecha-
nisms for the development of breast cancer as  a result of drinking alcohol. In the 
following paragraphs, the committee describes the results of several genotoxicity tests and evaluates the genoto xic properties of ethanol.  In addition, the possible 
role of one of the metabolites of ethanol , ie acetaldehyde, will be discussed.  
In their report ‘Evaluation of the carcinogenicity of chemical substances’ (1996/
26), the committee distinguished the following categories of carcinogens on the basis of their mechanism of action:1 Genotoxic carcinogens
• Stochastic genotoxic carcinogens• Non-stochastic genotoxic carcinogens
2 Non-genotoxic carcinogens.
Evaluation of the genot oxicity tests of ethanol
The available genotoxicity test s are summarized in table 6.8 ( in vitro  genotoxic-
ity tests), table 6.9 ( in vivo  genotoxicity tests in somatic cells) and table 6.10 ( in 
vivo genotoxicity tests in germinal cells) of the DECOS document.
In vitro genotoxicity testsThe available in vitro  genotoxicity tests (see table 7. 2) are performed in the pres-
ence and in the absence of metabo lic activation. Most of these in vitro  tests gave 
negative results for (a) gene mutations in bacteria
11, 21, (b) micronuclei21 and 
chromosome aberrations (CA) in hu man lymphocytes and Chinese Hamster 
Ovary (CHO) cells21, 30, (c) Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE)21, and (d) DNA 
damage9, 21. However, a few of the in vitro  tests were positive for ethanol. Gene 
mutations in yeast21, induction of chromosome aberrations (CA) in human blood 
lymphocytes3 and sister chromatid exchange in CHO cells12 were observed after 
treatment with ethanol.
The committee noti ced that the in vitro  tests, showing negative results for 
genotoxicity, were predominantly performed in the absence of a metabolic acti-vation system
2, 3, 12, 20, 21. Based on these studies the co mmittee concludes that in Advice of the Committee on the evaluation of the carcinogenicity of chemical substances 177most studies ethanol is not mutagenic without the presence of a metabolic sys-
tem. Only in the study of Badr et al.3, positive results were found in human lym-
phocytes without metabolic activation*. 
In vivo genotoxicity tests
Ethanol predominantly gave negative results in the in vivo  genotoxicity tests in 
somatic cells (see table 7.3). The micronucleus assay was negative in cells of Swiss mice
21, Ddy-mice21, Wistar rats (268)32 and CD rats4 given ethanol 
(orally). In addition, tests for chromosome aberrations (CA) and Sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in somatic cells of Wistar rats
32 and Chinese hamsters were 
predominantly negative as well21. In germinal cells (see table 7.4), ethanol did 
not induce CA in spermatogonia and testicular cells19, 21.
But again, in a minority of the in vivo  tests in somatic cells (micronuclei bone 
marrow3, 4, sister chromatid exchan ge in foetal liver cells1  **), ethanol was found 
to be positive. Moreover, an increase of aneuploidy was detected in most germi-
nal cells tested23, 24, 33. In spermatogonia and spermatids of male Chinese 
hamster21, aneuploidy was absent. Furthermore,  four (out of seven) dominant 
lethal assays (279, 280, 282, 284)3, 26, 27, 33 were positive.  
Evaluation of the genotoxic pot ential of ethanol by Phillips and 
Jenkinson30 
In 2001, Philips and Jenkinson reviewed the genotoxic potential of ethanol. They 
concluded that there is clear evidence th at ethanol is not a bacterial or mamma-
lian cell mutagen, but in vitro  assays for chromosome aberration, although 
mostly negative, have generally not included exogenous metabolic activation. Reported tests for chromo some aberration induction in vivo  are all negative and 
only a minority of the micronucleus tests are positive. Conflicting results have been reported for dominant lethal assay.  There is some evidence that ethanol 
induces SCE in vivo  and can also act as a ane ugen at high doses. The authors 
noted many in vivo  studies used very high doses and sometimes for long periods. 
The results in these studies, with excessive exposure to ethanol, may show some degree of genotoxicity. However, they co ncluded that there is no convincing evi-
* The committee points out that  for the metabolic activation of ethanol, both a microsomal ethanol oxidizing system 
(MEOS), catalase and alcohol dehydrogenase are necessary. Th erefore, the addition of an  S9-preparation is less 
relevant because this metabolic system might not contain (sufficient) alcohol dehydrogenase.
** Only under special circumstances178 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)dence that ethanol is a genotoxic hazar d at exposure level which are obtainable 
by either inhalation or dermal  exposure in the workplace. 
ConclusionThe committee is of the opinion that ethanol was predominantly negative in bac-
teria. In most in vitro  tests with mammalian cells, ethanol was negative as well. 
The committee agrees with Phillips et al.
30 that, except for aneuploidy, most 
in vivo  tests (in somatic and germinal cells) were negative. However, positive 
results were also observed (mai nly dominant lethal assays); 
Finally, ethanol clearly induces aneuploidy in germinal cells23, 24, 33 of 
exposed animals. For aneuploidy, the committee assumes a non -stochastic geno-
toxic mechanism.
AcetaldehydeEthanol is metabolized in several steps. First, it is oxidized to acetaldehyde and 
subsequently converted to acetate.
In 1999, IARC concluded that there is inadequate evidence in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde  and there is sufficient evidence in experimental 
animals for the carcinog enicity of acetaldehyde
22. Acetaldehyde causes gene 
mutations in bacteria and gene mutations , sister chromatid exchanges, micronu-
clei and aneuploidy in cu ltured mammalian cells, without metabolic activation.
Based on the evaluation of IARC, the co mmittee concludes that acetaldehyde 
is a genotoxic carcinogen in experimental animals. 
Limited studies are perfor med in which acetaldehyde concentrations are deter-
mined in human blood or amniotic fluid after ethanol exposure. O’Brien et al.7 
studied six pregnant women who ingested ethanol once in the 16-18 week of pregnancy. In four of the six women acetaldehyde was detected in the venous blood samples. Other studies did not find acetaldehyde concentrations in human 
blood samples. The limited amount of in formation concerning the presence of 
acetaldehyde in human blood is probably a result of the fact  that acetaldehyde 
levels are extremely difficult to detect in human blood after exposure to ethanol
14. 
Moreover, Castro et al.8 showed that a cytosolic and microsomal fraction of 
breast tissue of female Sprague Dawley rats has the ability to bioactivate ethanol 
to acetaldehyde and free radicals. No stud ies are available con cerning levels of Advice of the Committee on the evaluation of the carcinogenicity of chemical substances 179acetaldehyde determined in different human tissues (e.g. breast) after ethanol 
intake.
ConclusionThe committee concludes that there is a positive association between alcohol 
intake and breast cancer risk (and cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, 
oesophagus and liver). Several mechanisms of action have been suggested. 
On the one hand, a role for the endogenous hormones has been proposed. 
However, information concerning these mechanisms is limited and uncertainty 
remains whether there may be a threshold dose below which alcohol intake does not elevate the breast cancer risk in women. Moreover, the committee empha-
sizes that based on the present available data, such a threshold cannot be identi-
fied.   
On the other hand, a lot of information is available regarding the genotoxic prop-
erties of ethanol. In a minority of the in vivo  and in vitro  genotoxicity tests (other 
than aneuploidy), ethanol was positive. Most genotoxicity tests were negative 
after treatment with ethanol (although some of them were not performed cor-
rectly). Therefore, based on the genot oxicity tests the committee concludes that 
there is only limited eviden ce for a genotoxic potential of ethanol. However, ace-
taldehyde, a genotoxic compound, is one of the major metabolites of ethanol and can be detected in the human body after i ngestion of ethanol. As a role for acetal-
dehyde in the genotoxicity of ethanol cannot be excluded, the committee cannot 
neglect the few positive results in the genotoxicity test. 
In conclusion, the committee is of the opinion that ethanol should be consid-
ered as a (stochastic) genotoxic carcinogen.

Skin notation
Skin notation
To decide wether a skin notation should be assigned to a compound, DECOS 
uses ECETOC document No. 31 as a guideline.
ECETOC Document No. 31315
A skin notation should be applied when the amount absorbed by both arms and forearms in 1 hour 
(continiously) could amount to more  than 10% of the amount that ca n be absorbed via the lungs on 
exposure to the proposed OEL for 8 hours, provided th at this OEL is set on the basis of systemic tox-
icity. 
For chemicals where there is considerable indust rial experience, current best practices and reli-
able information on health effects from them should be taken into considerati on in preference to or 
along with the theo retical approach.
Ethanol
For assessing whether a skin notation may be appropriate for ethanol, DECOS 
uses the data from Beskitt and Sun 75. A worst case estimate of the penetration 
rate was 0.7 mg ethanol/cm2/h, calculated from an experiment performed under 
occlusive conditions. This flux was obtained with a 25% (v/v) aqueous solution. However, experience learns that altho ugh theoretically the flux will linearly 186 Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)increase with increasing concentration (the kp will remain constant), this will not 
be the case in practice. Since the flux of 0.7 mg/cm2/h is obtained under occlu-
sion, it might overestimate the dermal uptake under occupational conditions (which are with out occlusion). 
A one-hour absorption by two hands and forearms (2000 cm
2) of ethanol results 
in a total dermal uptake of (2000 cm2 × 0.7 mg/cm2/h =) 1400 mg/h. On the other 
hand, a working day inhalatory exposure to an HBC-OCRV of 1300 mg/m3, will 
result in an internal uptake of 7800 mg per day, assuming a worker inhales 10 m3 
air during an 8 hour working day and a pulmonary retention of 60%. From this DECOS calculates that one hour absorption by two hands and forearms contrib-utes to 18% (1400/7800*100% = 18%) of the internal exposure after absorption 
via the lungs
*.
Therefore, DECOS recommends (as a worst case approach) a skin notation.
Use of ethanol as an antiseptic agentIn several occupational settings, dermal ethanol exposure will mostly occur as 
droplets on the skin under non-occlusive conditions and by washing hands with 
ethanol as antiseptic agent. The penetratio n rate of ethanol under these conditions 
is probably at least one order of magnitude lower than under occlusion due to the high evaporation rate of ethanol. The half -life of evaporation was estimated to be 
12 seconds 
74. This means that within 75 seco nds more than 99% of the applied 
dose will be evaporated. 
DECOS estimates that during a period of  75 seconds, a total dose of approxi-
mately 30 mg (0.7 * 2000 *75/3600) may penetrate into the skin (arms and fore-hands). Therefore, DECOS assumes that disinfection of both hands (and forearms) once with ethanol could result in a dermal uptake of 30 mg ethanol (worst case approach). 
* Desinfecting only the hands (and not th e forearms) with ethanol (420-800 cm2) will lower the amount absorbed via 
the skin.
