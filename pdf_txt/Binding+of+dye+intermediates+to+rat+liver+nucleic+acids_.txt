 PREFACE 
Proposition 651 requires the publication of a list of chemicals “known to the state” to 
cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.  The Office of Environmental Health Hazard 
Assessment (OEHHA) of the California Environmental Protection Agency maintains this list in its role as lead agency for implementing Proposition 65.   The Carcinogen 
Identification Committee (CIC) advises and assists OEHHA in compiling the list of chemicals that cause cancer as required by Health and Safety Code section 25249.8.  
The Committee serves as the state’s qualified experts for determining whether a 
chemical has been clearly shown to cause cancer.  
 In 2010 , OEHHA brought gentian violet  to the CIC for prioritization and ranking for future 
listing consideration.  In 2018, OEHHA selected gentian violet for consideration for 
listing by the CIC.  Upon selection, the public was given the opportunity to submit information relevant to the assessment of the evidence on its  carcinogenicity.  No 
submissions were received. 
 This document was released for public comment on August 17, 2018.  No comments were received from the public.  The present document is essentially the same as the 
one released, with the following minor clarifications.  The document as first released 
indica ted that gentian violet is also known as “crystal violet.”   A statement to this effect 
has now been added to the Executive Summary .  Figure 2 (showing the metabolism of 
gentian violet) has been updated to show the chemical structure of a nitrogen- centered 
free radical .  Finally,  clarification s have  been added that lesions diagnosed in the past 
as type A reticulum  cell sarcoma s are likely currently  classified as histiocytic sarcoma s.  
 At its November 1, 2018 meeting, the CIC by a unanimous vote found that gentian violet 
had been “clearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer.”  Accordingly, gentian violet (crystal violet) has 
been added to the Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer , 
effective November 23, 2018.

 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Gentian violet  (also known as crystal violet) refers to hexamethylpararosaniline chloride , 
a cationic triphenylmethane dye derived from aniline, and to commercial mixtures of 
triphenylmethane dyes with hexamethylpararosaniline chloride as the predominant 
constituent . 
 
Gentian violet, which produces a vibrant purple color,  has longstanding use as a 
biological and histological dye, and is a  key stain in the Gram method for categorizing 
bacteria.  In addition to such use, gentian violet  has commercial and consumer 
applications; current  commercial dye uses of gentian violet include production of inks 
and toners as well as coloration of papers and textiles.  Applications related to gentian violet’s antibacterial, antifungal, ant ihelminthic, antitrypanosomal, and antiviral 
properties  includ e use to promote general wound healing, and in the treatment of 
bacterial skin infections and fungal infections, including treatment of thrush of the nipple 
in breastfeeding mothers and oral thrush in infants.  Formulations currently available to 
consumers  in the US include antibacterial foams  and solutions of 1  - 2% gentian violet 
intended for topical use.  Such solutions have also been adapted by consumers for 
cosmetic use, such as do -it-yourself hair dye.  
 The use of gentian violet in animal feed or as a veterinary drug in food animals is 
prohibited in the US.  The US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) monitors domestic and imported seafood for gentian violet residues  and has issued import alerts 
for animal products containing gentian violet residues f rom a number of countries.  
Gentian violet has been detected in treated water effluents, seawater, and some 
seafood.   In the US, exposure to gentian violet may result from oral and topical use of 
gentian violet solutions, contact with inks, commercial dyes , and biological stains , and 
the consumption of contaminated seafood.  There is also potential for occupational 
exposure to gentian violet.  
 Human data on the carcinogenicity of gentian violet are sparse.  One hospital -based 
retrospective study of cancer in subjects that had received transfusions of blood treated with gentian violet and a single case report of leukemia in an individual five months after coming in contact with ink containing gentian violet provide little information relevant to the chemical’ s carcinogenicity . 
 
Gentian violet induced tumors at multiple sites in rats and mice in long- term 
carcinogenicity studies.  In the two rat studies, male and female F344 rats were

 exposed to gentian violet in utero, during lactation, and via feed post-weaning for up to 
24 months, with additional interim sacrifice groups at 12 and 18 months  (Littlefield et al. 
1989; NCTR 1988) .  In the two mouse studies, male and female B6C3F1 mice were 
exposed to gentian violet in feed for up to 24 months (Little field et al. 1985; NCTR 
1983) .  Tumor  findings are as follows:  
 
Liver tumors  
• In the male F344 rats, the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was  significantly 
increased in the highest dose group by pairwise comparison with controls, with a 
significant dose- related trend.  In addition, one hepatocellular carcinoma was 
observed in the low -dose group.  
• In the male B6C3F1 mice, the incidence of hepatoc ellular adenoma was  
significantly increased in the mid- and high- dose groups by pairwise comparison 
with controls, with a significant dose- related trend.  Hepatocellular carcinoma 
was significantly increased in the high- dose group by pairwise comparison wi th 
controls, with a significant dose- related trend.  
• In the female B6C3F1 mice, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma were both significantly increased in the mid- and high- dose groups by 
pairwise comparison with controls, with si gnificant dose- related trends.  
 
Thyroid tumors  
• In the male F344 rats, the incidence of thyroid gland fol licular cell 
adenocarcinoma was  significantly increased in the low - and high- dose groups by 
pairwise comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related tre nd.  The 
incidence of thyroid gland follicular cell adenoma or adenocarcinoma combined 
was significantly increased in the highest dose group by pairwise comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related trend.  
• In the female F344 rats, the incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell adenocarcinoma and adenoma or adenocarcinoma combined were significantly 
increased in the mid- and high- dose groups by pairwise comparison with 
controls, with significant dose- related trends.  These tumors are rare in untreated 
female F344 rats.  
 
Testis and epididymis tumors  
• In the male F344 rats, a dose- related increase in mesothelioma of the testis and 
epididymis was observed in the mid- and high -dose groups, and an increase was 
also seen at these dose groups in the 18- month interim sacrifice groups.

 Mononuclear cell leukemia 
• In the female F344 rats (18 -month interim sacrifice groups) , the incidence of 
mononuclear cell leukemia (MNCL) was significantly increased in the highest 
dose group by pairwise comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related 
trend.  Although no treatment -related increase in MNCL was apparent in animals 
at 24 months, NCTR (1988) stated that “dosing with gentian violet was 
significantly associated with an earlier onset and increased mortality due to leukemia”.  
 
Clitoral gland tumors  
• In the female F344 rats, a dose- related increase in clitoral gland adenoma or 
adenocarcinoma combined was observed in the mid- and high-dose groups.  
 
Harderian gland tumors  
• In the male B6C3F1 mice, the incidence of Harderian gland adenoma was  
significantly increased in the mid- and high- dose groups by pairwise comparison 
with controls, with a significant dose- related trend.  
• In the fe male B6C3F1 mice, the incidence of Harderian gland adenoma was  
significantly increased in all three treated groups by pairwise comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related trend.  
 
Reticulum cell sarcoma (type A) , likely histiocytic sarcoma  
• In the female B 6C3F1 mice, the incidence of type A reticulum cell sarcoma (likely  
histiocytic sa rcoma ) was significantly increased in the mid- and high -dose groups 
by pairwise comparisons with controls, with a significant dose- related trend, in 
each of the fo llowing tissues:  
o Bladder  
o Ovaries  
o Uterus  
o Vagina  
 
Metabolism of gentian violet can occur by both oxidative and reductive processes, and several of the metabolites formed are mutagenic and/or carcinogenic.  Oxidative metabolites of gentian violet have been measured in in vivo  studies of mice, rats, 
chicken s, and microbes, and in vitro  studies with liver microsomes isolated from mice, 
rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and chickens.  Reductive metabolites have been measured 
in vivo  in studies of mice, rats, fish and intestinal microflora isolated from rats, mice, and  
Gentian Violet                                                  4                                                             OEHHA

 humans.  Free radicals can be formed by either reductive or oxidative metabolism, with 
a carbon- centered free radical formed during reductive metabolism and a nitrogen-
centered radical formed during oxidative metabolism.  Carcinogenic metabolites inclu de 
the known carcinogens formaldehyde, C.I. Basic Red 9, and Michler’s ketone (the latter two are products of microbial metabolism and may be produced by intestinal microflora).  Other mutagenic metabolites include pentamethylpararosaniline, N,N,N',N' - and 
N,N,N',N'' -tetramethylpararosaniline, which are products of oxidative metabolism, and 
leucogentian violet  and leuco- pentamethylpararosaniline, which are products of 
reductive metabolism.  
 Gentian violet has tested positive for a number of genotoxicity endpoints:  
• Mutations in Salmonella typhimurium , and E.  coli 
• DNA damage in  B. subtilis , E. coli, and  mouse lymphocytes  
• Binding to cell -free calf thymus  DNA and synthetic polynucleotides , 
bacteriophage DNA, b acterial DNA , and chromosomes undergoing mitosis 
(“mitotic figures”) in human oral mucosa tissue 
• Chromosomal aberrations  (CAs) in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells, human 
HeLa cells and cultured lymphocytes, and other mammalian cells  
• Chromosome breakage in CHO and human peripheral blood cells  
• Gene amplif ication in a SV40 -transformed hamster cell line  
 The following gentian violet metabolites have also tested positive for genotoxicity:  
• Pentamethylpararosaniline chloride (both a metabolite, and a small constituent of 
commercial gentian violet preparations)  induces mutations in Salmonella 
typhimurium (four strains), B. subtilis, E. coli, and bacteriophage T4D, and binds 
to calf thymus DNA . 
• Leucogentian violet induces mutations in Salmonella typhimurium . 
• Leuco -pentamethylpararosaniline induces mutations in Salmonella typhimurium .  
• N,N,N',N' -tetramethylpararosaniline induces mutations in Salmonella 
typhimurium  and E. coli . 
• N,N,N',N'' -tetramethylpararosaniline induces mutations in Salmonella 
typhimurium and E. coli . 
• The carcinogenic metabolites formaldehyde, C .I. Basic Red 9, and Michler’s 
ketone are also genotoxic . 
 The biological activity of gentian violet was compared to seven  struct urally related 
compounds , two of which (C.I. B asic Red 9, and Michler’s ketone)  are listed as 
carcinogens under Proposition 65.

 • Common target tumor types observed between gentian violet and some of the 
comparison chemicals are:  
o Hepatocellular tumors (observed for three comparison chemicals)  
o Thyroid tumors (observed for one comparison chemical)  
o Harderian gland tumors (observed for one comparison chemical)  
• Six of the comparison compounds have genotoxic activity.  
 Gentian violet may act via multiple mechanisms, including being electrophilic or forming electrophilic metabolites, genotoxicity, oxidative stress induction, and recept or-mediated 
effects.  
• Gentian violet is a direct acting electrophile that reacts with DNA and other nuc
leophiles.  Gentian violet also forms electrophilic metabolites, such as free 
nitrogen- or carbon- centered radicals formed during metabolic N-demethylation 
and reduction reactions.  
Gentian violet is genotoxic, as summarized above.  
Gentian violet induces oxidative stress by forming reactive oxygen species.  In 
addition, gentian violet is active in seven ToxCast high- throughput screening 
(HTS) a ssays that have been mapped to this key characteristic  of carcinogens . 
Gentian violet can modulate receptor -mediated effects, based its activity in 18 
ToxCast HTS assays that have been mapped to this key characteristic  of 
carcinogens .  •

 2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Identity of Gentian Violet  
“Gentian violet” refers to hexamethylpararosaniline chloride , a cationic triphenylmethane 
dye derived from aniline, and to commercial mixtures of triphenylmethane dyes with 
hexamethylpararosaniline chloride as the predominant constituent.  “Crystal violet ” has 
been used interchangeably with gentian violet to refer  to both hexamethylpararosaniline 
chloride and to commercial mixtures of triphenylmethane dyes with 
hexamethylpararosaniline chloride as the predominant constituent .  There are additional 
terms used to refer specifically to gentian violet; some of the more common examples,  
such as “methyl violet 10B”, are given in Table 1.  
 
The term “methyl violet”  typically refers to pent amethylpararosaniline chloride, a minor 
constitu ent of the gentian violet mixture.  However,  “methyl violet”  has occasionally  
been used to refer to hexamethylpararosaniline chloride and commercial mixtures  of 
triphenylmethane dyes with hexamethylpararosaniline chloride as the predominant 
constituent  (e.g., Kumar et al. 2011; Schaeppi 1955).  For the purpose of this document, 
the term “methyl violet ” will be used only to refer to pentamethylpararosaniline chloride.  
 
Structure s of aniline, triphenylmethane, and gentian violet are  given in Figure 1.  The  
possible identities of the various substituents (R1, R2, R3, and R4) depicted in the structure of gentian violet (Figure 1c) are indicated in the inset table.

2.2 Synthesis of Gentian Violet  
Synthesis of gentian violet dates to the 19th century, with several known methods of 
production that result in mixtures of varying purity.  The earliest reported synthesis of gentian violet is attributed to Charles Lauth, a French chemist ( Gessner and Mayer 
2000; Maley and Arbiser 2013) .  This initial synthesis was achieved through oxidation of 
dimethylaniline with copper salts, which resulted in formation of a mixture containing tetra-, penta- , and hexa- methylated pararosaniline chlorides (Passmore 1890) .  
Another synthesis method reacts dimethylaniline with carbonyl dichloride, this method generates Michler’s ketone, 4, 4'-bis(dime thylamino) benzophenone, as an intermediate 
(Gessner and Mayer 2000) .  If the dimethylaniline precursor is pure, its reaction with 
carbonyl dichloride should yield hexamethylpararosaniline chloride ( Harvey 1990) .

January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 Related synthesis methods that replaced carbonyl dichloride with chloropicrin or carbon 
tetrachloride were subsequently introduced ( Cooksey 2017) .  Gentian violet can also be 
synthesized by oxidation of aniline and p-toluidine (Harvey 1990) , or by oxidation of an 
intermediate leuco dye (leucogentian violet) following formation of the intermediate by 
condensation of formaldehyde and dimethylaniline (Gessner and Mayer 2000). 
2.3 Use, Occurrence, and Exposure  
Use 
 Gentian violet, which produces a deep, vibrant purple color, found early uses as a 
biological and histological dye, including as a key stain in the Gram method for categorizing bacteria and as a nuclear stain, and as a commercial dye ( Berry et al. 
1996; Cooksey 2017; Popescu and Doyle 1996) .  Gentian violet  continues to be used in 
biological and histological stains, with the addition of novel in vivo  biomedical stain 
applications  (Sheng and Chen 2017; Suzuki et al. 2016) .  Gentian violet is also still used 
as a commercial dye.  A pplications includ e the coloration of  paper , textiles , and related 
materials, and in particular elastic  fibers , such as  acrylic fibers  (Cooksey 2017; Gessner 
and Mayer 2000; Thetford 2013) .  Gentian violet is also used to produce commercial 
inks for writing implements , such as  indelible pencils and ballpoint  pens , as well as 
inkjet inks and toner s (Cooksey 2017; Sun et al. 2016) .  A review by the European 
Chemicals Agency (ECHA 2012 ) noted additional potential dye applications  for gentian 
violet , including use in crayons, soaps, lacquers, and wood . 
 Therapeutic uses of gentian violet are also now relatively common; gentian violet is known to have antibacterial, antifungal, ant ihelminthic, antitrypanosomal, and antiviral 
properties, although efficacy varies (Maley and Arbiser 2013) .  As an antitrypanosomal 
agent, gentian violet  has been incubated with banked blood prior to transfusion to 
prevent transmission of Chagas disease in endemic areas such as Latin America (Ramirez et al. 1995; Vilaseca et al. 1966) .  Therapeutic applications include promotion 
of general wound healing  (Farid et al. 2011) as well as treatment of bacterial infections 
of the skin  (Berrios and Arbiser 2011) , fungal infections  including thrush of the nipple in 
breastfeeding mothers and or al thrush in infants ( Goldstein 2015) as well as vaginal 
yeast infections
2, burns ( Arsalan Ali et al. 2013 ), and radiation- induced dermatitis 
(Bolderston et al. 2006 ; Maley and Arbiser 2013) .  Therapeutic formulations currently 
                                            
2 Prescription preparations for vaginal yeast infections were discontinued in the US in 1990; however, 
online sources provide instructions for “do- it-yourself” preparations.  One such source is the website of a 
gynecologist/obstetrician, which receives several million views annually:

 available in the US include antibacterial foams  approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)  (Edwards 2016; Woo and Heil 2017) as well as solutions of 1 - 2% 
gentian violet, intended for topical use, that are readily available without a prescription.  
Such solutions have also been adapted for cosmetic use, such as do -it-yourself hair 
dye3. 
 
Although veterinary uses of gentian violet are prohibited in the US , gentian violet  is used 
in other countries as a topical treatment of skin and eye infections in domestic animals, and for the treatment of fungal and parasitic infections in fish and other seafood in aquaculture.  In some countries  gentian violet  is also used in animal feed to inhibit 
fungal growth, including mold ( Kamyab et al. 2009).  The FDA prohibits use of gentian 
violet in animal feed or as a veterinary drug in food animals (21 CFR 500.29, 21 CFR 
500.30, and 21 CFR 589.1000).  The FDA monitors domestic and imported seafood for 
gentian violet residues and has issued import alerts for animal products cont aining 
gentian violet residues  from a number of countries , as these  contaminated  products are 
considered adulterated in the US  (FDA 2008 , 2018). 
 Occurrence and Exposure  
 
Gentian violet is a contaminant in some surface waters.  Gentian violet has been 
detected in treated effluents in China, at concentrations ranging from below 0.030 μg /L 
to 0.049 μg/L (Zhan g et al. 2012 ).  Gentian violet concentrations have also been 
reported in seawater, including water sample s from aquaculture sites (0.92 μg/L) and a 
coastal sea (0.52 μg/L) in China (Lee et al. 2010). 
 
Gentian violet is also found in biota as a result o f intentional use and bioaccumulation 
from contaminated environments.  To date, the FDA has detected gentian violet in concentrations up to 26.9 ng/g in imported fish (FDA 2018) .  Researchers have 
quantified gentian violet in seafood samples from Asia, including eel, fish, and shrimp, with concentrations ranging from levels below limits of detection to 168.4 ng/g ( Lee et 
al. 2010; Lian and Wang 2013) .  In a German study, 35 of 45 wild eels caught 
downstream from municipal sewage treatment plants had detectable levels of gentian 
violet and its leuco metabolite up to, respectively, 0.35 ng/g and 6.7 ng/g ( Schuetze et 
al. 2008 ).  A recent US study of processed fish ‘nuggets ’ from domestically raised 
catfish quantified gentian violet (1.1 ng/g) in 1 of 24 samples tested ( Ozbay et al. 2013).

In the US, exposure to gentian violet may result from oral and topical use of gentian violet solutions and t herapeutic preparations, contact with inks , commercial dyes , and 
biological stains , and the consumption of contaminated seafood.  There is also potential 
for occupational exposure to gentian violet.  
3. DATA ON CARCINOGENICITY  
3.1 Carcinogenicity Studies in  Humans  
One hospital -based study of cancer in human s exposed  to gentian violet  and one case 
report  were identified in a recent literature search conducted by OEHHA (Appendix A).  
The hospital -based cancer  study was  discussed in the following t hree publicat ions, all of 
which were published in Portuguese and translated into English by certified translation 
through the UC Berkeley library service for OEHHA:    
 
1. De Sousa et al. (1989) , the report of the  study , presented at a scientific 
conference  
2. Amato Neto and Pasternak (1990) , a letter to the editor with comments regarding  
de Souza et al. (1989)  
3. Luquetti (1990) , a response to Amato Neto and Pasternak (1990) by one of the 
authors of De Sousa et al. (1989)  
 As mentioned in Section 2. 3, gentian violet was added to banked blood pre- transfusion 
to prevent Chagas disease, which is caused by the protozoan Tryp anosoma cruzi  (T. 
cruzi ).  Gentian violet was  added to the banked blood at concentrations  as high as  250 
µg/m L for at least 24 hours, while the blood was stored at 4 
oC (Schmunis 1999; 
Vilaseca et al. 1966).  De Sousa et al. (1989)  interviewed 4, 765 patients at the Jorge Araújo Hospital of the 
Cancer Association of the State of Goiás  in Brazil, and asked them if they recalled 
getting a blood transfusion and if the blood looked purple.  A sample of gentian violet -
treated blood was shown to the interviewees.  Out of these patients, 37 confirmed that they had received gentian violet treated blood, between 2- 27 years ago.  In 26 of these 
37 patients, a benign or malignant neoplastic lesion was confirmed through reference to 
medical records.  Among the 26 cases, 18 were benign and 8 were possibly malignant.  
The specific sites of these lesions were not reported, and risk estimates were not presented by the authors.  N o further information or study details w ere provided.

January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 Amato Neto and Pasternak (1990)  pointed out some limitations of the De Sousa et al. 
(1989)  study, including the lack of controls, the selection bias that the interviewees were 
patients in a hospital that is “affiliated with an ‘association of combating cancer’”, the 
reliance on patients’ recollection without verifying with the blood bank, and confounding 
factors such as higher iron levels and immunosuppression in blood transfusion recipients.  
 
Professor Alejandro Luquetti, one of the original authors of  (De Sousa et al. 1989) , later 
published a response to Amato Neto and Pasternak (1990)  in the form of a letter to the 
editor  (Luquetti 1990 ).  In the response, Luquetti stated that half of the patients treated 
at the hospital did not have cancer, and that this was merely a preliminary effort.  On the issue of lack of controls, Luquetti stated that the cases were being compared to patients 
who did not receive any blood transfusions, or received red blood (as compared to purple), or who could not recall what color the blood was.  However, the incidence of cancer in each of these groups w as not given.  He also mentioned that a central part of 
the project was still underway, in an attempt to match the “cases” (mostly lymphomas and leukemias) with the controls.  
 The case report  was published in German, and describes  a case of leukemia in an 
individual exposed to what th e author called “methyl violet”
4 (Schaeppi 1955) .  A 57 -
year old man accidentally stabbed his right hand in the skin fold between two fingers 
with an ink pen containing gentian violet of unknown concentration.  Eight weeks later, he developed swoll en lymph nodes.  The first swollen lymph nodes were observed at 
the right axilla and the right arm.  Five months after the incident, the man was 
diagnosed with lymphocytic leukemia.  The author stated that a causal link between the 
ink pen incident  and the  leukemia was assumed, although no blood work had been 
performed on the patient at the time of the incident . 
3.2 Carcinogenicity Studies in Animals  
OEHHA identified multiple  carcinogenicity studies of gentian violet conducted in 
experimental animals .  Two dietary studies in Fischer 344 (F344) rats  (one in males, 
one in females)  (Littlefield et al. 1989; NCTR 1988 ) and two dietary studies in B6C3F1 
mice  (one in males, one in females) (Littlefield et al. 1985; NCTR 1989 ) were conducted 
by the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) .  These NCTR animal 
bioassays have also been reviewed and summariz ed by the Joint Food and Agriculture 
                                            
4 The author also noted that it was a mixture of chlorides of penta- and hexa- methylpararosanilines, so 
the substance in the ink pen would be what we call “gentian violet”, instead of “methyl violet”.

Additives, JECFA (2014) . 
 
As briefly discussed by NCTR (1983), two other sets of long -term studies of gentian 
violet were conducted in rats and published in the 1940s .  One is Kinosita (1940)  and 
the other is Fitzhugh (1949, an unpublished study).  Kinosita (1940) administered 
gentian violet ( referred to  by the author as 4:4 ':4''-hexamethyltriaminotriphenylmethane) 
to rat s orally over a period of more than 300 days, and reported findings of “gastric 
papilloma and a slight adenomatous proliferation in the liver”.  However, the publication 
provides no information on the doses  admin istered, the number of rats per group, or 
whether the study included controls .  In summarizing both the Kinosita (1940) and 
Fitzhugh (1949) studies, NCTR (1983) noted the significant study design issues and 
other limitations of the se two sets of studies: 
 
“Two chronic studies were conducted in rats; however, no conclusions were 
drawn since each study suffered from several design and/or conduction 
deficiencies.  Kinosita (1940) detected gastric papillomas and an adenomatous proliferation of hepatic tissue in rats after dosing for over 300 days.  The dose 
level was not stated.  Fitzhugh (unpublished data, FDA files, 1949) treated rats 
for up to two years at levels up to 1600 ppm.  These inconclusive data revealed 
dose- related hepatic neoplastic nodules and dys plastic foci that were more 
severe in females.”

Male and female weanling F344 rats (F 0) were given gentian violet (99% 
hexamethylpararosani line chloride, 1% pentamethylpararaosaniline chloride, and <<1% 
tetramethylpararosaniline chloride) in the feed at dose levels of 0, 100, 300, or 600 ppm for at least 80 days.  While receiving dosed feed, the female rats  were mated with males 
of the same dose level (F
0).  Through communication with NCTR scientists, OEHHA 
confirmed that gentian violet remained in the diet of the test animals during mating, 
gestation, and lactation.  Therefore, F 1 rats were exposed in utero and via lactation.  
Two F1 males and two F1 females were randomly selected from each litter and allocated 
to the long- term studies .  The F 1 weanling rats received gentian violet in the feed at the 
same dose levels (0, 100, 300, or 600 ppm) as their F 0 parents.  According to JECFA 
(2014), these dose levels were approximately equivalent to 0, 30, 80, and 160 mg/kg bw 
per day for male F 1 rats, and 0, 40, 100, and 200 mg/kg bw per day for female F 1 rats.  3.2.1  L

 All F1 animals received feed and drinking water ad libi tum, for up to 24 months .  The 
male and female studies each had 180 controls and 90 animals  per gentian violet -dosed 
group.  An additional two sets of animals with  15 rats/ dose group were included in each 
study for interim sacrifice at  12 and 18 months .

 A statistically s ignificant increase  in mortality compared to the controls was observed in 
the 300 ppm group, starting around week 95.  The average bodyweight in the 600 ppm group was statistically significantly lower than the controls , starting at about  week 28, 
and a decrease in feed consumption was also observed in this group, as compared with controls . 
 Tumor s observed in the male rat  study  are presented in Table 2.  A statistically 
significant increase in liver hepatocellular adenomas w as seen in the 600 ppm dose 
group,  compared to controls, with a positive dose- related trend.   NCTR (1988) reported 
that one hepatocellular carcinoma was also observed in the 100 ppm group.  In the  18-
month interim sacrifice  groups  one hepatocellular adenoma was found in the 100 ppm 
group.  No tumors were observed at any site in the animals sacrificed at 12 months .  A 
statistically significant increase in thyroid follicular cell adenocarcinomas w as observed 
at both the 100 and 600 ppm dose levels by pairwise comparison with controls, with a statistically significant dose response.  There was also a statistically significant increase in thyroid follicular cell adenomas or adenocarcinomas (combined) in the 600 ppm group by pairwise com parison with controls, with a positive dose- related trend.   In the 
18-month interim sacrifice groups  one thyroid follicular cell adenoma was observed in 
each of the 300 and 600 ppm groups.  I ncreases in mesotheliomas of the testis and 
epididymis were obser ved in the 300 and 600 ppm groups, and increases were also 
seen at these same doses in the 18-month interim sacrifice groups (NCTR 1988) . 
 
Non-neoplastic pathology findings  
The authors reported almost no treatment -related non- neoplastic findings at 12- and 18 -
month necropsies.  In animals on test for up to 24 months, several non- neoplastic 
pathology findings were observed in the liver, thyroid gland, spleen, and lymph nodes of 
gentian violet treated male rats.  In the liver, a positive dose- related trend was observed 
for clear cell foci, eosinophilic foci, basophilic foci, mixed cell foci, cytoplasmic 
vacuolization, centrilobular necrosis, and liver regeneration.   Specifically, clear cell foci 
and basophilic foci were significantly increased in the 600 ppm group, eosinophilic foci and centrilobular necrosis were increased in the 300 and 600 ppm groups, and mixed cell foci, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and liver regeneration were increased in all treated

compared to controls, while triglyceride  levels were decreased in the 600 ppm group  
compared to controls.  In addition, thyroid gland follicular cysts and spleen red pulp 
hyperplasia were increased in the 600 ppm group with a positive dose- response trend.  
In the lymph nodes, mesenteric reticulum cell hyperplasia was increased in the 300 and 600 ppm groups, with a positive dose- related tr end.

 Females  
 
A statistically s ignificant increase  in mortality compared to the controls was observed in 
the 300 and 600 ppm females  after the first year.  NCTR (1988) attributed the increased 
mortality in the mid - and high- dose groups to mononuclear cell leukemia (MNCL), which 
occurred earlier and was more lethal in gentian violet -treated animals than in controls.  
The average bodyweight in the 600 ppm group was significantly lower than that of 
controls and the difference was more apparent in the second year.  At the end of the 
study, the average bodyweight in the 300 ppm group was also significantly lower than 
that of  the controls.  N o differences in feed consumption were  observed between control 
and treated female rats . 
 
Tumor s observed in the female rat  study  are presented in Table 3.  Statistically 
significant increases in thyroid follicular cell adenocarcinomas, and adenomas or 
adenocarcinomas combined were seen in the 300 and 600 ppm groups by pairwise 
comparison, with positive dose- related trends .  One thyroid follicular cell 
adenocarcinoma was observed in 100 ppm females in the 18-month interim sacrifice 
groups.   Thyroid follicular cell adenomas and (adeno)carcinomas are rare in untreated 
female F344 rats in NCI and NTP two -year feeding studies ( Goodman et al. 1979; 
Haseman et al. 1985) .  No tumors were observed at any site in the animals sacrificed at 
12 months .  A statistically significant  increase in MNCL  was observed at 600 ppm in  the 
18-month interim sacrifice groups, with a significant dose- related trend.  Although no 
treatment -related increase in MNCL was apparent in animals on test for up to 24 
month s, NCTR (1988) reported that “dosing with gentian violet was significantly 
associated with an earlier onset and increased mortality due to leukemia” in this study .  
Increases in clitoral gland adenoma and adenocarcinoma combined were also observed 
in the 300 and 600 ppm groups , with NCTR (1988) not ing that the increases were 
“suggesti ve of a treatment -related trend” . 
 
Non-neoplastic pathology findings  
 
The authors reported almost no treatment -related non- neoplastic findings at 12- and 18 -
month necropsies.  In animals on test for up to 24 months, significant increases of non-
neoplastic findings were seen in the liver and bone marrow.  In the liver, mixed cell foci, liver regeneration, and centrilobular fatty change were significantly increased in all treated female rats compared to control s, with  positive dose- related trends.  
Eosinophilic foci and bile duct hyperplasia were increased in both 300 and 600 ppm groups with dose- related trends.  There was a statistically significant increase of 
centrilobular necrosis as well as hematopoietic cell proliferation in the 600 ppm group, with a dose related trend.  An increase in liver clear cell foci was seen in the 300 ppm

increased in the 300 and 600 ppm groups, with a dose- related trend.

Male and female B6C3F1 (C57BL/6 x C3H) mice 4- 5 weeks of age were given gentian 
violet (99% hexamethylpararosani line chloride, 1% pentamethylpararosaniline chloride , 
and <<1% tetramethylpararosaniline chloride) in the feed at dose levels of 0, 100, 300 
and 600 ppm for up to 24 months.  According to JECFA (2014), the dose levels were 
approximately equivalent to 0, 10.7- 14.3, 32.1 -35.7 and 64.3 mg/kg bw per day for male 
mice, and 0, 14.3, 35.7 -39.3 and 71.4 mg/kg bw per day for female mice.  All animals 
received feed and drinking water ad libitum , for up to 24 months .  The male and female 
studies each had 180 controls and 90 animals per gentian violet -dosed group.  
Additionally, two sets of animals with 1 5 mice/ dose group were included in each st udy 
for interim sacrifice at 12 and 18 months . 
 Males  
 The mortality rates for all groups of male mice were very low until approximately 500 days, after which there was a significant dose -related trend in increased mortality.  
There w ere no differences in bodyweight between the control s and any of the gentian 
violet -treated groups.   
 Tumor s observed in the male mouse study  are presented in Table 4.  There were 
statistically significant increases in hepatocellular adenomas at 300 and 600 ppm, and in hepatocellular carcinomas at 600 ppm, with positive dose- related trends.  Lung 
metastases of liver tumors were observed in some mice, and occurred in 3/93 a nimals 
in the 600 ppm group compared to 3/183 in controls.  No clear treatment -related 
increase in tumors at any site was observed at either the  12- or 18- month interim 
sacrifice.  In addition, t he incidence of Harderian gland adenomas w as significantly 
increased in the 300 and 600 ppm groups, with a dose- related trend.

 Females 
 
The mort ality rate for all groups of female mice was very low until approximately 56 0 
days, after which statistically  significant increase s in mortality were observed in all 
treated groups, compared to controls .  There w ere no differences in bodyweight 
between the control s and any of the gentian violet -treated groups.  
 
Tumor s observed in the female m ouse study are presented in Table 5.  The incidences 
of hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas were significantly increased 
by pairwise comparison with controls (p<0.001) in the 300 ppm and 600 ppm groups , 
with positive dose- related trends.  Lung metastases of liver tumors were observed in 
some mice, with none in controls, one instance in the 100 ppm group, three in the 300 
ppm group, and 13 in the 6 00 ppm group.  In the 18- month interim sacrifice groups, 
hepatocellular adenomas were significantly increased in the 600 ppm group by pairwise 
comparison with controls, and positive dose- response trends for increases in 
hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed.  A significant increase of 
Harderian gland adenomas was observed in each of the treated groups by pairwise comparison with controls, with a significant dose- response trend.  In addition, 
statistically significant increases in the incidence of neoplasms classified by NCTR as 
“type A reticulum cell sarcomas ” of the bladder, ovaries, uterus, and vagina occurred in 
the 300 and 600 ppm groups  by pairwise comparison with controls, with positive dose-
response trends.  Reticulum cell sarcoma (Type  A) is an older term for neoplasms that 
most likely would be classified now as  “histiocytic sarcoma ” (Frith et al. 1993) .  
However, the lack of tissue slides/blocks available from this study makes it unfeasible 
for NCTR pathologists to confi rm a new designation (email communication with NCTR).

Non-neoplastic pathology findings  
A significant increase of spleen erythropoiesis was observed in each of the treated 
groups (except for a borderline increase at 100 ppm), compared to controls , with a 
positive dose- response trend (NCTR, 1983).  
3.3 Other Relevant Data 
3.3.1  Pharmacokinetics and m etabolism  
Information for the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of gentian violet stems from studies in animals, microbes, and cell free systems.  In vivo studies include 
studies in rats, mice, chickens ( McDonald and Cerniglia 1984; McDonald et al. 1984a; 
NCTR 1985 , 1989) , fish (Chan et al. 2012 ; Thompson et al. 1999) , and studies in the 
protozoan parasite, T. cruzi  (Docampo et al. 1983) .  Several in vitro  studies include 
experiments with microsomes from rats, mice, hamsters, chickens, and guinea pigs 
(Harrelson and Mason 1982; McDonald and Cerniglia 1984 ; McDonald et al. 1984b) , 
and a study using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as the metabolic activation system   
(Gadelha et al. 1992) .  In addition, several studies examined aerobic and anaerobic 
metabolism  by various fungi and bacteria ( Bumpus and Brock 1988; Chen et al. 2007; 
Kumar et al. 2011; Yatome et al. 1991; Yatome et al. 1993) , including the metabolites 
formed by human and animal microflora (McDonald and Cerniglia 1984). 
 
Absorption  
 
Absorption studies of gentian violet in mammals are limited but indicate rapid absorption 
of gentian violet upon gavage (within 2 hours) of a single dose in male and female rats 
(McDonald et al. 1984a; NCTR 1989 ).  Absorption of gentian violet is thought to be 
greater compared to other triphenylmethane dyes based on greater urinary and biliary 
excretion for gentian violet compared to other triphenylmethane dyes (see ‘Excretion’ 
below) (NCTR 1989 ).  NCTR (1989)  reasons that the greater absorption of gentian 
violet may be based on its  smaller molecular weight compared to other 
triphenylmethane dyes , as well as its  neutral charge in the intestinal environment  which 
may increase its permeability.  Absorption in rats following oral administration can be 
indirectly estimated to be less than 10 percent , based on measures from urinary  and 
biliary excretion experiments ; absorption is estimated to be slightly higher in mice 
(McDonald et al. 1984a) . 
 
In chickens, gentian violet is also rapidly absorbed from the diet, reaching peak levels in blood during the first hour post administration,  which  rapidly decline within 4 hours 
(Olentine et al. 1980) .  Half -lives of gentian violet in blood ranged from 1.43 hours for  
Gentian Violet                                                  24                                                             OEHHA  
January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 male to 1.68 hours for female chickens.  No gentian violet residue was found in blood 
samples taken after 48 hours (Olentine et al. 1980) .  Studies in fish also indicate rapid 
absorption of gentian violet from the water column (1- 2 hours) by fish ( Chan et al. 2012 ; 
Thompson et al. 1999).  
Distribution  
 
Rodents  
Upon absorption following a single gavage dose to male and female F344 rats, [phenyl -
U-14C] gentian violet was distributed to the kidney, liver, gonads, and fatty tissues, with 
the kidney and liver exhibit ing the highest levels (McDonald et al. 1984a; NCTR 1989 ).  
Radioactivity was found in all tissues examined two hours post -administration and 
reached a peak at 4 hours in the kidney and liver.  Depletion half -lives for liver and 
kidney were 14.5 and 14.4 hours in male and 17 and 18.3 hours in female rats.  Levels 
in fatty tissue accumulated slowly and reached a plateau at 24 h ours.  A depletion rate 
of residue from fatty tissue could not be determined.  
 In multi -dose experiments male and female rats and mice were gavaged with [phenyl -U-
14C] gentian violet twice per day for seven days  and animals were sacrificed 2 hours 
after the last dose ( McDonald et al. 1984a; NCTR 1989 ).  The highest residue levels 
(14.8 – 24 ppm) were present in the fatty tissue of female rats and male and female 
mice; the level in the fatty tissue of male rats w as 3.2 ppm.  Muscle tissues had low 
residue levels (0.1- 1.3 ppm) in both species and sexes.  Rat liver residues were 
approximately 4 ppm, whereas mouse livers had levels as high as 17.8 ppm in males 
and 10.7 ppm in females.  The tissue residues included parent material (gentian violet), 
demethylated (penta- and tetra- methylpar arosaniline) and reduced (leucogentian violet, 
leuco- pentamethylpararosaniline) metabolites, with fatty tissue containing the highest 
concentration of reduced metabolites.  The metabolit es were variously distributed 
among the tissues, sexes, and species.  The parent compound ranged from 19 and 29 ppb in male rat kidney and liver, respectively, to 60 and 122 ppb in female rat kidney and liver, respectively.  Adipose tissues had high levels  of leucogentian violet  and 
leuco- pentamethylpararosaniline ranging from 1813 ppb in male rats to 7043 ppb in 
female rats; levels for mice were between these levels.  
 
Chicken s 
A 7-day multi -dose experiment was carried out with male and female Cornish- White  
Rock broiler chickens where [phenyl -U-14C] gentian violet was administered via 
capsules three times per day, and animals were sacrificed 6, 24, 48, 120, and 240 hours after the last dose ( NCTR 1985 ).  Depletion of radioactive labeled gentian violet 
was determined in seven edible tissues, i.e., the liver, kidney, gizzard, breast, thigh, 
heart, and skin.  Residues were detected in all tissues, with the highest levels reported 
in the liver of both male and female chickens.  The residues included parent compound  
Gentian Violet                                                  25                                                             OEHHA  
January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 (gentian violet), penta- and the two tetra- methylpararosaniline isomers.  These 
compounds were only detected at the 6- hour sampling point and not at later times; the 
authors note that unidentified insoluble tissue residues represented a s ubstantial portion 
of the total residue in most tissues at all sampling  times.  Depletion kinetics were bi -
phasic and consistent between males and females.  Half -lives for phase 1 depletion in 
male chickens ranged from 2.7 hours in liver to over 6 hours in kidney and muscle 
tissues; half -life for liver depletion in female chickens was 38.2 hours.  The authors 
attributed the longer half -lives for phase 1 in females to fewer available data points 
during that phase.  Phase 2 depletion of the liver had longer half -lives for both sexes, 
with 215 hours for males and 153 hours for females.  
 
In another diet study in Hubbard x Hubbard broiler breeder chickens, radioactive 
gentian violet or metabolites were also present in edible tissues, with the highest levels repor ted in kidneys 8 hours post administration ( Olentine et al. 1980) .  Radioactivity was 
highest in liver and kidney; levels declined quickly in the first 24 hours in all tissues, but 
persisted at a detectable level in the kidney until 432 hours post administration.  Half -
lives for kidney residues were 105 hours in males versus 10.4 hours in females.  The 
authors had no explanation for this difference.  Gentian violet and its  metabolites did not 
accumulate in the fatty tissue; however, radioactivity was found in eggs up to 456 hours 
post-administration.  
 
Fish 
In fish , gentian violet was rapidly metabolized to leucogentian violet .  While the parent 
compound was not detected in muscle tissue by 14 days post -dosing, leucogentian 
violet  was detected in muscle tissue up to day 79 in Channel catfish and day 91 in 
Atlantic salmon ( Chan et al. 2012; Thompson et al. 1999). 
 
Metabolism  
 
Metabolism of gentian violet can occur by both oxidation and reduction, and either pathway can lead to the production of free radicals as well as mutagenic and/or carcinogenic metabolites (See Figure 2 below).  Oxidative metabolism has been 
observed in viv o in mice, rats, and chickens, and in vitro  with liver microsomes from 
both sexes of four strains of mice, three strains of rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and chickens ( McDonald et al. 1984a; McDonald et al. 1984b ; NCTR 1985 , 1989) as well as 
during microbial biotransformation of gentian violet (Bumpus and Brock 1988; Chen et  
al. 2007; Kumar et al. 2011) .  Reductive metabolism of gentian violet occurs in rodents 
and fish, and has also been observed in incubations of gentian violet with cell 
suspensions from  the intestinal microflora from rats, mice, and humans, and in microbial 
biodegradation studies ( Chan et al. 2012; McDonald and Cerniglia 1984; NCTR 1985 , 
1989; Thompson et al. 1999; Yatome et al. 1991 ; Yatome et al. 1993 ).  Gentian violet 
can undergo single electron reductions and oxidations, leading to the formation of  
Gentian Violet                                                  26                                                             OEHHA  
January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 carbon- or nitrogen- centered free radicals, respectively.  Single- electron reactions have 
been observed with whole cell and homogenate preparations of T. cruzi , with rat 
microsomes, during light exposure of gentian violet, and in enzymatic reactions with 
HRP  (Docampo et al. 1983; Gadelha et al. 1992; Harrelson and Mason 1982 ; Leaver 
1972) .  Further details of oxidative and reductive metabolism are described below.  
 
Oxidative metabolism involves the demethylation of gentian violet via the sequential 
removal of a single methyl group at each step, resulting in the formation of pairs of 
isomers.  These isomers are distinguished from each other by the position of where the methyl group has been removed (from the same site or from a different site of the 
gentian violet molecule ).  Demethylation yields penta- , tetra -, tri-, di-, mono - and non-
methylated metabolites.  The non- methylated metabolite, pararosaniline (C.I. Basic Red 
9), is a known carcinogen.  While complete demethylation of gentian violet (i.e., C.I. 
Basic Red 9) has not been assessed in animal models, it has been observed during microbial degradation.  The partially  demethylated metabolites 
pentamethylpararosaniline, and two tetramethylparar osaniline isomers, N, N,N',N'- and 
N,N,N',N''-tetramethylpararosaniline, all of which are positive in bacterial mutagenicity 
tests ( Aidoo et al. 1990 ; Hass et al. 1986) , have been identified in various tissues in vivo 
in rodents and chicken  as well as in vitro ( McDonald et al. 1984b; NCTR 1985 , 1989) .  
During demethylation reactions, formaldehyde, another known carcinogen, is formed at each demethylation step (see Figure 2) (Docampo et al. 1983; Gadelha et al. 1992) .  
Formaldehyde production increased in vitro  with increasing amounts  of HRP , and the 
reaction was inhibited with reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate.  
Reductive metabolism of gentian violet leads to the formation of leucogentian violet , 
leuco- pentamethylpararosaniline, and other leuco- metabolites, possibly via the 
formation of a carbon- centered free radical  (Docampo and Moreno 1990) .  
Leucogentian vi olet, leuco -penta- and possibly leuco- tetra-methylpararosaniline have 
been identified in tissues of rats and mice.  L eucogentian violet  is the main metabolite 
found in the muscle tissue of fish and in the fatty tissue of rats and mice ( Chan et al. 
2012; NCTR 1989 ; Thompson et al. 1999) .  Leucogentian violet  is also the major 
metabolite formed by microflora isolated from the feces or intestine from humans,  rats 
and chickens  (McDonald and Cerniglia 1984) .  Both leucogentian violet  and leuco-
pentamethylpararosaniline were mutagenic when tested in bacterial mutagenicity 
assays ( Hass et al. 1986). 
  
Single electron reactions and free radical formation  
Gentian violet can be photochemically or electrochemically reduced or oxidized in one-electron reactions, leading to the formation of carbon- or nitrogen- centered free radicals, 
respectively (Docampo et al. 1983; Gadelha et al. 1992 ; Harrelson and Mason 1982; 
Leaver 1972; Reszka et al. 1986) .  Under anaerobic conditions, photoreduction of

January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 gentian violet with light of greater than 500 nm wavelength led to the formation of a free 
carbon- centered tri(p -dimethylaminophenyl)methyl radical ( Leaver 1972; Reszka et al. 
1986) .  No such radical could be detected under aerobic conditions, but gentian violet 
converted oxygen to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide under aerobic conditions and visible light, and the reaction was enhanced by the addition of NAD(P)H ( Reszka et 
al. 1986) .  A carbon centered free radical was also observed during incubation of 
gentian violet with rat hepatic microsomes supplemented with NADPH and under a 
nitrogen atmosphere, i.e., anaerobic conditions  (Harrelson and Mason 1982) .  Radical 
formation was inhibited with carbon monoxide, suggesting the involvement of 
cytochrome P450.  Similarly, radical formation also occurred when intact cells or 
homogenates of trypomastigotes or epimastigotes (infectious stages of T. cruzi ) were 
incubated with gentian violet under a nitrogen atmosphere ( Docampo et al. 1983) .  Light 
enhanced the trypanocidal action of gentian violet.  
A nitrogen- centered free radical was formed when gentian violet was oxidized by HRP , 
a reaction that has been observed with other N -methyl substituted aromatic amines.  
This reaction also resulted in the formation of formaldehyde ( Gadelha et al. 1992; Van 
der Zee et al. 1989) .  It is possible that the nitrogen radical is further metabolized to 
pentamethylpararosaniline.  
 Additional Pathways  
 
In some microbes, gentian violet can be metabolized to 4,4-
bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone (Michler’s ketone) and N,N -dimethylaminophenol 
(Chen et al. 2008; Yatome et al. 1991; Yatome et al. 1993) .  Michler’s ketone can be 
further metabolized to 4- hydroxybenzaldehyde and N,N -dimethylaminophenol by some 
microorganisms (Chen et al. 2008) .  Michler’s ketone is a known carcinogen listed 
under P roposition 65 (NCI 1979; Proposition 65 List).  
 
Gentian violet preparations used in metabolism studies  
 
As discussed in Section 2.1 (Identity  of gentian violet ), gentian violet refers to 
hexamethylpararosaniline chloride, and to commercial mixtures of tripheny lmethane 
dyes typically containing >  96% hexamethylpararosaniline chloride.  Other constituents 
of the commercial mixtures typically consist of  < 4% penta- and tetra -
methylpararosaniline, and, if present,  trace amounts of trimethylpararosaniline.   Gentian 
violet preparations may also contain trace  amount s of unreacted Michler’s ketone.  Both 
commercial grade gentian violet as well as more purified gentian violet (higher content of hexamethylpararosaniline) have been used in metabolism studies.  Henc e, the 
question arises as to whether measurements of penta- or tetra-methylpararosaniline or 
Michler’s ketone  in metabolism studies may simply reflect the presence of these 
compounds in the starting material.  However, evidence from multiple studies indicates

 that penta- and tetra-methylpararosaniline and Michler’s ketone are indeed formed from 
gentian violet preparations via enzymatic action and thus are metabolites .  Active 
demethylation of gentian violet is supported by experiments that demonstrate the l inear 
decrease of the parent compound and the simultaneous formation and increase in 
demethylated metabolites over time ( Bumpus and Brock 1988; Chen et al. 2007; Kumar 
et al. 2011) .  In addition, incubation of gentian violet with rat microsomes, but not heat -
killed microsomes or extracts without microsomes, leads to the formation of 
demethylated products from the parent compound.  Furthermore, stepwise 
demethylation of gentian violet was also demonstrated via the incubation of 
pentamethylpararosaniline with rat microsomes, which led to the disappearance of substrate and appearance of tetramethylpararosaniline ( McDonald et al. 1984b) .  In 
biodegradation studies that reported Michler ’s keton e as a metabolite, the authors 
purified commercial gentian violet prior to its use (Yatome et al. 1991; 1993).  In conclusion, while some unmetabolized substrate may account for a portion of the metabolites identified, these findings indicate that enzymati c demethylation of gentian 
violet and metabolism to Michler ’s ketone takes place.  
 
Excretion 
 Studies in rats and mice indicate that g entian violet is excreted in the feces, with some 
excretion via the urine also occurring  (NCTR, 1989; McDonald et al. 1984a) .  In male 
and female F344 rats, fecal excretion of the administered dose amounted to 72.9% and 
63.8%, respectively ; urinary excretion amounted to about 2.2% of the administered 
dose in both sexes ( McDonald et al. 1984a) .  Bile duct cannulation studies conducted in 
female rats reported that 5.7% to 6.4% of the administered dose of gentian violet was 
excreted in the bile within 28 hours ( McDonald et al. 1984a; NCTR 1989 ).  In male mice,  
urinary excretion was about 5.9 percent of the administered and it was 8.1 percent of the administered dose in female mice (McDonald et al. 1984a; NCTR 1989 ). 
 The parent compound, gentian violet, was present in the highest concentration in the feces of female rats and mice compared to other metabolites found.   In addition to the 
parent compound, the gentian violet metabolites pentamethylpararosaniline, the two 
isomers of tetramethylpararosaniline, leucogentian violet , and  leuco-
pentamethylpararosaniline were detected in the feces of both sexes of rats and mice 
(NCTR 1989).    
 Summary  
 Upon absorption, gentian violet is distributed throughout the body, initially concentrating in the liver and kidney, then accumulating in fatty tissues.  Its absorption is greater 
compared to other triphenylmethane dyes, possibly based on a smaller molecular size and neutral charge and greater uptake in the intestine.  Clearance of gentian violet

 residues  is biphasic .  In fish, gentian violet residues can remain in the muscl e tissue for 
up to three months.  Gentian violet residues have been detected in chicken eggs up to 
19 days after treatment.  Excretion of gentian violet occurs primarily via feces and with 
some excretion occurring via urine. 
 Metabolism of gentian violet can be oxidative or reductive, and several of the metabolites formed are mutagenic and/or carcinogenic, and include the known 
carcinogens formaldehyde, C.I. Basic R ed 9, and Michler’s ketone ( the latter two formed 
by microbial metabolism ).  Free radicals can be formed by either reductive or oxidative 
metabolism, with a carbon- centered free radical formed during reductive metabolism 
and a nitrogen- centered radical formed during oxidative metabolism ( Docampo et al. 
1983; Gadelha et al. 1992; Harrelson and Mason 1982) .  While no studies on the 
human metabolism of gentian violet have been identified, one stud y with human fecal 
microflora demonstrated that gentian violet can be reduced to leucogentian violet , thus 
indicating that reductive metabolism and possibly radical formation may occur in humans (McDonald and Cerniglia 1984).

 3.3.2  Genotoxicity  
The genotoxicity of gentian violet has been reviewed and summarized by  JECFA 
(2014) .  In summarizing gentian violet’s genotoxicity data, JECFA stated the following:  
“The data show that gentian violet binds to DNA, and this, together with the 
cellular toxicity of gentian violet, complicates both the testing of gentian violet in vitro and the interpretation of the results. The results are somewhat varied in 
Salmonella t yphimurium , with positive responses in some strains but not in 
others. Gentian violet was clastogenic in vitro and positive in indicator tests for 
DNA damage. There are few in vivo tests on gentian violet.  A single in vivo test for clastogenicity (mouse bone marrow assay) showed no evidence of clastogenic activity, but the Committee noted that the gentian violet was given via 
the drinking -water at lower doses (4 and 8 mg/kg bw per day) than those used in 
the mouse cancer bioassay (ranging from 10 to 70 mg/kg bw per day). Similarly, 
the other in vivo test on DNA damage in mouse lymphocytes using single intravenous doses up to 6 mg/kg bw showed no effect. The committee concluded 
that, overall, the data show that gentian violet is genotoxic.  
In view of the carcinogenicity of gentian violet in the mouse and rat and evidence 
showing genotoxicity in a number of tests, the Committee concluded that gentian 
violet should be considered a carcinogen acting by a genotoxic mode of action.”  
OEHHA reviewed JECFA’s evaluation of the genotoxicity studies, and has included  the 
relevant sections of JECFA (2014)  here,  as Appendix B .   
3.3.2.1 Additional studies on the genotoxicity of gentian violet  
Several  additional publications on the genotoxicity of gentian violet that were not 
included in the JECFA (2014) review were identified in the literature search conducted 
by OEHHA .  The findings from these additional studies are reported in the table below 
(Table 6).  Overall, these additional studies showed positive  results for bacteria 
mutagenicity  (e.g., Salmonella TA 98, TA100; E. coli WP2 ), negative result s in one sex -
linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila , and positive results for DNA binding.

1 As named by the study authors.  As discussed in Section 2.1, crystal violet is a synonym for gentian 
violet.  
2 This study is in Japanese. The study results are available as a permanent record from TOXLINE at 
https ://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi -bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+toxline:@term+@DOCNO+EMICBACK/30607   
3 This study has some discussion on the oxidative damage induced by the photolysis of the non- covalent 
crystal violet -DNA complex.  
4 The affinity of crystal violet for the c alf thymus DNA was 10- fold higher than for the synthetic mixed 
ribo·deoxyribo nucleotide polymers.  
5 The authors defined “mitotic figures” as “various chromosomal arrangements in cells undergoing 
division”.  
Besides genotoxicity studies, several studies have shown that gentian violet can be 
metabolized through single electron reduction to form carbon- or nitrogen- centered free-
radical s (Docampo et al. 1983; Gadelha et al. 1992; Harrelson and Mason 1982; Lewis 
and Indig 2002) .  Docampo et al. (1983)  also found that light enhanced the formation of 
the free radicals, which were thought to be responsible for gentian violet’s toxicity 
towards t he parasite T. cruzi .   
 
3.3.2.2 Studies on the genotoxicity of gentian violet metabolites  
Pentamethylpararosaniline 
OEHHA identified studies on  the genotoxicity of pentamethylpararosaniline, a gentian 
violet metabolite, as well as a small constit uent of commercial gentian violet 
preparations .  As shown in Table 7, p entamethylpararosaniline induces mutations  in 
four strains of Salmonella typhimurium  (TA97, TA100, TA104, and TA1535), B. subtilis , 
E. coli, and bacteriophage, and binds to calf thymus DNA in a  cell-free system.

 Leucogentian violet  and leuco- pentamethylpararosaniline  
Leucogentian violet  and leuco- pentamethylpararosaniline both induced mutations in 
Salmonella TA98 in the presence of S9 ( Hass et al. 1986). 
Tetramethylpararosaniline isomers  
The two tetramethylpararosaniline isomers, namely N,N, N',N'- and N,N, N',N''-
tetramethylpararosaniline, both induced mutations in E. coli ( Hass et al. 1986) .  In 
another study, N,N, N',N'- tetramethylpararosaniline w as weakly mutagenic in Salmonella 
TA97 and TA104, and  N,N,N',N''-tetramethylpararosaniline was weak ly mutagenic  in 
Salmonella strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA104 (Aidoo et al. 1990). 
C.I. Basic Red 9, Michler’s ketone, and formaldehyde  
C.I. Basic Red 9 and Michler’s ketone are microbial metabolites of gentian violet that 
may be produced by intestinal microflora.  Both are IARC Group 2B  carcinogens  with 
positive genotoxicity data (see Section 3.3.4).   Briefly, C.I. Basic Red 9  is mutagenic in 
bacteria and mouse lymphoma cells , tests positive for  DNA damage in E. coli  and 
unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in mammalian cells in vitro , results in mutagenic 
urine in mice and rats, and is positive for chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in Syrian 
hamster embryo cells .  Michler’s ketone induces  mutations  in some strains of 
Salmonella and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, DNA damage, UDS, and DNA 
binding in rats, CAs in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) and CHE -3N cells, SCE in CHO 
cells and in bone marrow cells of mice  in vivo , and chromosome aneuploidy in CHE -3N 
cells. 
Formaldehyde is formed during the reductive metabolism of gentian violet (see Sect ion 
3.3.1).   Formaldehyde is an IARC Group 1 carcinogen with positive genotoxicity data 
(IARC 2006 , 2012) .  Positive findings of genotoxcity ( e.g., mutations, DNA damage, 
DNA strand breaks, CAs, MN, SCE, and DNA -protein crosslinks) come from st udies of 
exposed humans and animals, and from in vitro  systems. 
3.3.3  Animal tumor pathology  
This section describes the relevant pathology details for the tumor types observed in the 
animal cancer bioassays of gentian violet.

 Rats  
 
Liver hepatocellular tumors  
 
Hepatocellular adenomas were increased in male F344 rats treated with gentian violet 
(NCTR 1988; Littlefield et al.  1989).  One hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in the 
100 ppm group.   Liver hepatocellular carcinomas are rare (0.7%) in untreated male 
F344 rats in NTP feeding studies ( Haseman et al. 1985; Haseman et al. 1998) and in 
untreated male F344 rats tested by the NCI’s Carcinogenicity Testing Program (Goodman et al. 1979). 
 
Hepatic adenomas and carcinomas arise from the same cell type, and adenomas can 
progress to carcinomas (Harada et al. 1999). 
  
Thyroid foll icular cell tumors  
 
Thyroid follicular cell adenomas and adenocarcinomas were increased in male and female F344 rats treated with gentian violet for 24 months.  Thyroid follicular cell adenomas are rare in untreated male and female F344 rats, occurring at 0.39- 0.9% in 
males and 0.17- 0.5% in females in NTP and NCI two- year feeding studies ( Goodman et 
al. 1979; Haseman et al. 1985) .  Thyroid follicular cell ( adeno) carcinomas are rare in 
untreated female F344 rats, occurring at 0.28 -0.4% in these studies  (Goodman et al. 
1979; Haseman et al. 1985) .  Specifically,  Goodman et al. (1979) reported that thyroid 
follicular cell adenomas occur at 0.17% and carcinomas occur at 0.39% in untreated 
female F344 rats .  In male F344 rats, thyroid follicular cell carcinomas were reported to 
be rare by Haseman et al. (1985)  and Goodman et al. (1979) .  Thyroid gland follicular 
cell adenomas and (adeno) carcinomas arise from the same cell type  (Botts et al. 1991). 
 
Mononuclear cell leukemia 
 
MNCL  is a common neoplasm in aging F344 rats, and an increase of MNCL  was 
observed at the 18 -month interim sacrifice in high-dose female rats, with a significant 
dose- related trend across all treatment groups .  Although no treatment -related increase 
was apparent in the animals allowed to live up to 2 years, NCTR (1988) noted that “dosing with gentian violet was significantly associated with an earlier onset and increased mortality due to leukemia”.  
 MNCL is morphologically characterized by cells that resemble large granular 
lymphocytes , and can spread to multiple organs, including liver, lungs, and spleen, with 
splenic infiltration being the most consistent hallmark ( Stromberg and Vogtsberger 
1983) .  The spontaneous incidence of MNCL  in female F344 rats  in NTP two-year  
Gentian Violet                                                  37                                                             OEHHA  
January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 studies  was 20.2% during 1977- 1987 and 26.8% during 1980- 1989 (Caldwell 1999). 
The incidence of MNCL in the control female rats was 0 at 18 months and 45% at 24 
months (NCTR 1988 ).  US EPA (2012)  noted that several authors have concluded that 
rat MNCL is similar to human natural  killer (NK) cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia 
(Ishmael and Dugard 2006; Stromberg 1985 ; Thomas et a l. 2007). 
 
Mesothelioma of the testis and epididymis  
 
Mesotheliomas of the tunica vaginalis  of the testis and epididymis were observed in the 
treated male F344 rats at 18 months and 24 months.  This site is not part of the routine necropsy, and only the tumors that were observed grossly were later confirmed 
microscopically.  
 Mesothelioma of the tunic a vaginalis of the testes is a malignant neoplasm. The  tumor 
growth can extend to the epididymides  and spermatic cord with seeding of the 
peritoneal cavity and viscera ( McConnell et al. 1992). 
 Clitoral gland tumors  
 
Clitoral gland adenomas or adenocarcinomas were observed in female F344 rats at 24 
months.  The clitoral glands are a pair of sebaceous glands located in the inguinal region adjacent to the vagina.  Their excretory ducts empty on the clitoris near the urethral opening (Yoshizawa 2018) .  In female rats, the growth and activity of the glands 
are regulated by hormones ( Rudmann et al. 2012) .  Although there are no equivalent 
glands in humans, rodent clitoral glands are standard tissues that are evaluated for human risk assessment of chemicals ( Rudmann et al. 2012) .  Both adenoma and 
adenocarcinoma of the clitoral gland are derived from acinar cells  (Yoshizawa 2018). 
 
Mice  
 
Liver hepatocellular tumors  
 
Liver hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in gentian violet treated 
male and female B6C3F1 mice (Littlefield et al.  1985; NCTR  1983).  Hepatocellular 
adenoma and carcinoma arise from the same cell type, and adenomas are considered to have the potential to progress to carcinomas, as shown by atypical cell foci of various 
stages of malignancy (Harada et al. 1999).   NCTR (1983) mentioned that most of the 
hepatocellular carcinomas  observed in these studies  were trabecular , and a few were 
solid.  All of the  24 liver tumors that metastasized to the lungs were of the trabecular 
pattern.  
  
Gentian Violet                                                  38                                                             OEHHA  
January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 Harderian gland tumors  
 
Harderian gland adenomas were increased in male and female B 6C3F1 mice treated 
with gentian violet at 24 months (Littlefield et al.  1985; NCTR  1983).  
 The Harderian glands are bilateral lacrimal glands located at the posterior part of the eye of certain vertebrates ( Sheldon 1994) .  While the Harderian glands are not present 
in humans, tumors of the Harderian glands in rodents are considered an indicator of cancer hazard ( Huff 1992 ). 
 
Reticulum cell sarcoma 
 
Significant increases of reticulum cell sarcoma were seen in the bladder, ovary, vagina, and uterus of 600 ppm gentian violet treated female mice at 24 months, each with a dose- related trend.  Although pathologically not identical, the reticular system 
neoplasms in mice and humans generally arise from equivalent normal cells, namely 
stem cells, granulocytes, reticulum cells, and plasmacytes ( Dunn 1954) .  Mouse 
reticular tissue sarcoma (type A) may be sarcoma, localized monocytic leukemia, or 
generalized monocytic leukemia, and has been shown to be induced by chemical 
carcinogens (Dunn 1954 ).  According to the pathology section of NCTR (1983), the 
reticulum cell sarcomas (type A) of the female genital organs were similar to the description by Dunn (1954): “The tumors were composed of sheets of elongated spindled cells with basophilic ovoid nuclei and scanty acidophilic cytoplasm,  involving 
the wall of the vagina, cervix, and uterus.”   Based on descriptions by Frith et al. (1993) , 
reticulum cell sarcoma ( type A) is an older term for neoplasms that most likely would be 
classified now  as “histiocytic sarcoma ”.  However, the lack of tissue slides/blocks makes 
it unfeasible for NCTR pathologists to confirm a new designation (email communication 
with NCTR).  
 
3.3.4  Structure activity considerations  
As stated in Section 2.1, gentian violet  refers to the triphenylmethane dye 
hexamethylpararosaniline chloride, and to commercial mixtures of triphenylmethane 
dyes containing > 96% hexamethylpararosaniline chloride , with < 4%  
pentamethylpararosaniline chloride and N,N,N',N' -  and N,N,N',N'' -
tetramethylpararosaniline chloride, and trace levels of N,N', N''-trimethylparar osaniline 
chloride, each of which has a triphenylmethane core structure.  OEHHA used 
Chemotyper ( https://chemotyper.org/
, Version 1.0, Revision 12976), a tool available 
from the US EPA for searching and highlighting chemotypes (chemical structures or subgraphs), to identify chemicals that share structural similarities with  
Gentian Violet                                                  39                                                             OEHHA

 hexamethylpararosaniline chloride.  S tructurally similar chemicals w ere chosen for 
structure activity comparison with gentian violet, based on the following characteristics: 
1) presence of the triphenylmethane structure; 2) no methoxy groups; 3) no halogen or 
sulfur groups; 4) no additional aromatic rings; 5) testing for genotoxicity or animal carcinogenicity.  
The six compounds are: pentamethylpararosaniline chloride, C.I.  Basic Red 9 
(para rosaniline hydrochloride) , magenta (including magenta I , magenta II, and magenta 
III), malachite green chloride , leucomalachite green, and methyl green.  In addition, 
Michler’s ketone was included for structure activity comparison because it is a precursor 
in gentian violet production, it  may be present at trace levels in commercial gentian 
violet  (see Section 3.3.1 ), and it is a product of microbial metabolism of gentian violet 
(Chen et al. 2008; Yatome et al. 1991; Yatome et al. 1993) , and thus may be produced 
by intestinal microflora. 
Data on the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of the selected comparison chemicals  are 
discussed below and in Table 8.  The sources of this information include the ToxNet 
databases ( https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov
) such as Chemical Carcinogenesis Research 
Information System (CCRIS), Carcinogenic Potency  Database (CPDB), Genetic 
Toxicology Data Bank (GENE -TOX), and Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB), 
and NTP and IARC documents.  No human cancer epidemiology studies were identified 
for any of the comparison chemicals .  However, “magenta production” , which involves 
exposure to many chemic als including C.I. Basic Red 9 as well as Magenta I, II, and III, 
is an IARC Group 1 carcinogen (IARC 2012) .  IARC (2012) found there is sufficient 
evidence in humans that magenta production causes urinary bladder cancer.  
Pentamethylpararosaniline chloride may be  a minor constituent of commercial  gentian 
violet preparations .  It is a demethylated metabolite of hexamethylpararosaniline 
chloride (see Section 3.3.1) .  No long -term carcinogenicity studies in animals were 
ident ified for this chemical .  It is mutagenic in Salmonella, B. subtilis , E. coli, and phage 
T4D, and binds  to calf thymus DNA (see Section 3.3.2) .  
   C.I. Basic Red 9 (pararosaniline hydrochloride) is the fully  demethylat ed metabolite of  
hexamethylpararosaniline chloride, which is also a microbial metabolite of gentian violet that may be produced by intestinal microflora.  C.I. Basic Red 9 is an IARC group 2B 
carcinogen.  It induces  tumors in male and female rats and male and female mice in a 
variety of sites ( NTP 1986) .  It is mutagenic in Salmonella, E. coli, and mouse 
lymphoma LY5178 cells, positive for  DNA damage in E. coli  and UDS in mammalian 
cells in vitro , results in  mutagenic urine in mice and rats, and is positive for 
chromosomal aberrations (CAs)  in Syrian hamster embryo cells  (IARC 2010 ; Leifer et 
al. 1981) .

 Magenta, which has historically been used to refer to the dye mixture “basic fuchsin” , is 
comprised of four major constituents, namely Magenta 0 ( C.I. Basic Red 9), Magenta I 
(rosaniline),  Magenta II, and Magenta III (new fuchsin) .  The structures of Magenta I, II, 
and III are shown in Table 8.  IARC (2010 , 2012) considered the carcinogenicity of 
magenta and magenta production, and classified magenta as “possibly carcinogenic to 
humans” (Group 2B), based primarily on mechanistic and other relevant data.  Regarding the carcinogenicity of magenta in animals, IARC (2012)  noted the following:  
 
“Magenta was tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in one experiment in mice (Bonser et al., 1956), one experiment in rats (Ketkar & Mohr, 1982) and one experiment in hamsters (Green et al., 1979). These studies were found to be 
inadequate to evaluate the carcinogenicity of magenta in experimental animals.”  
 
Besides issues of study quality, it is unclear which one of the magenta chemicals (e.g., Magenta I, II, III, or some combination) was used in each of these magenta cancer 
bioassays.  
 Genotoxicity studies on magenta as a whole (exact composition of the products tested 
and the degree of purity unknown) indicate that magenta is mutagenic in Salmonella 
(IARC 2010) .  In addition, Magenta I has been shown to be  mutagenic in Salmonella 
and E. coli, and positive in the rec-assay in B. subtilis  (Fujita et al. 1976; IARC 2010 ; 
Mortelmans et al. 1986 ).  
  
Malachite green chloride was tested in long -term carcinogenicity studies by NTP (2005)  
in female rats and mice.  In female rats, NTP concluded there was  “equivocal evidence 
of carcinogenic activity” based on the occurrence of  thyroid gland follicular cell adenoma 
or carcinoma (combined)  (0/46, 0/48, 3/47, 2/46 in control, low -, mid -, and high- dose 
groups, respectively) and increased incidences of  hepatocellular adenoma (1/48, 1/48, 
3/48, 4/48)  and mammary gland carcinoma  (2/48, 2/48, 1/48, 5/48) (NTP, 2005) .  NTP 
concluded there was “no evidence” of carcinogenic activity observed in the study 
conducted in female mice.  Malachite green chloride induced DNA damage in CHO cells 
(Fessard et al. 1999)  and in the liver of male Swiss albino mice ( Donya et al. 2012) , 
induced MN in bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes of male rats ( NTP 2004 ), CAs 
in Chinese hamster lung cells (Ishidate 1981, as cited by ECHA 2010) , and CAs and 
sister chromatid exchange (SCE)  in the bone marrow of treated Swiss albino male mice 
(Donya et al. 2012). 
 Leucomalachite green is a reduction product of malachite green chloride.  It was tested 
in long -term carcinogenicity studies by NTP in male and female F344/N rats and female 
B6C3F
1 mice (NTP 2005).  In male rats, NTP concluded there was “equivocal evidence” 
of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of interstitial cell adenoma of the  
Gentian Violet                                                  41                                                             OEHHA  
January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 testes (37/48, 42/47, 43/48, 45/47 in control, low -, mid -, and high- dose groups, 
respectively) and the occurrence of thyroid gland follicular cell adenoma or carcinoma 
(combined) (0/47, 2/47, 1/48, 3/46).  In female rats, NTP concluded there was 
“equivocal evidence” of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of 
hepatocellular adenoma (1/48, 3/48, 0/48, 3/48) and the occurrence of thyroid gland follicular cell adenoma or carcinoma (combined) (0/46, 1/46, 2/47, 1/48).  In female mice, NTP concluded there was “some evidence” of carcinogenic activity based on 
increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) (3/47, 6/48,  
6/47, 11/47).  
 
In addition to the NTP studies, leucomalachite green has also been tested by the NCTR 
in two -year feeding studies in male and female F344/N NCTR BR rats ( Culp et al. 
2002) .  It caused a marginally increased incidence of  lung alveolar/bronchiolar 
adenomas in male rats  (p = 0.052), with a significant positive trend  (1/48, 2/47, 5/48, 
6/47)  (Culp et al. 2002).   Leucomalachite green induced mutations  in livers of treated  
female Big Blue B6C3F1 mice ( Mittelstaedt et al. 2004 ) and induced DNA adducts in 
livers of treated male and female rats and female mice (Culp et al. 2002).  
 No long -term carcinogenicity studies in animals were identified for methyl green.  Methyl 
green did not induce sex -linked recessive lethal gene mutations in Drosophila 
melanogaster  (Clark 1953) .  It did not induce DNA damage in a rec -assay spot test in B. 
subtilis  (H17A vs M45T) ( Kada et al. 1972) .  Methyl green did not induce mutations in 
Salmonella (Chung et al. 1981). 
 
Michler’s ketone (4,4' -Bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone)  is a precursor in the synthesis 
of dyes including gentian violet ( Gessner and Mayer 2000) , and is also a microbial 
metabolite of gentian violet that may be produced by intestinal microflora ( Yatome et al. 
1991; Yatome et al. 1993 ).  Michler’s ketone is  an IARC  Group 2B carcinogen ( IARC 
2010) .  In the cancer bioassays conducted by NCI (1979) , dietary administration of 
Michler’s ketone induced tumors in male and female rats, and male and female mice 
(NCI 1979) .  
 
Michler’s ket one is mutagenic in some strains of  Salmonella ( Dunkel and Simmon 1980 ; 
Dunkel et al. 1985; Kamber et al. 2009 ; NTP 2018; Tennant et al. 1986) and in mous e 
lymphoma L5178Y cells ( Mitchell et al. 1988; Myhr and Caspary 1988) .  It tested 
positive  in several in vivo  DNA damage assays , induced UDS in male F344 rats 
(Mirsalis et al. 1989), and induced liver DNA damage i n rats ( Kitchin and Brown 1994; 
Parodi et al. 1982) .  Michler’s ketone bound to liver DNA in rats ( Scribner et al. 1980) 
and liver and kidney DNA in phenobarbital -pretreated rats ( Struck et al. 1981) .  It 
induced CAs in CHO cells  and CHE -3N cells  (Lafi et al. 1986; NTP), SCE in CHO cells

 (NTP 2018) and in bone marrow of Swiss mice in vivo ( Parodi et al. 1982) , and 
increased the level of chromosome aneuploidy i n CHE -3N cells  (Lafi et al. 1986). 
As summarized in Table 8, seven chemicals that are structurally related to 
hexamethylpararosaniline chloride were considered for comparison.  All of the 
comparison chemicals were tested for mutagenicity and all except methyl green tested 
positive .  Three of the comparison chemicals, namely C.I. Basic Red 9, malachite green 
chloride, and Michler’s ketone were tested for chromosomal effects  and all three tested 
positive.  All comparison chemicals were tested for DNA damage/binding, and all but 
methyl green tested positive.

Three of the tumor types observed to be increased in animal studies of gentian violet, 
namely liver hepatocellular tumors, thyroid follicular cell tumors , and Harderian gland 
tumors, were also increased in animal studies of  some of the comparison chemicals .  
Specifically, increases in hepatocellular tumors were seen with C.I. Basic Red 9, leucomalachite green, and Michler’s ketone (with equivocal findings for malachite green chloride); thyroid follicular cell tumors were seen with C.I. Basic Red 9 (with equivocal 
findings for malachite green chloride and leucomalachite green); and Harderian gland tumors were seen with C.I. Basic Red 9.

 3.3.5  ToxCast h igh-throughput screening assays  
ToxCast™ is a chemical prioritization research program developed by the US EPA ( Dix 
et al. 2007; Judson et al. 2010; Kavlock et al. 2012) .  It is a multi -year project that 
launched in 2007.  ToxCast utilizes various in vitro  and zebrafish systems to identify 
chemical activity in a battery of high- throughput screening (HTS) assays.  As of 2018, 
more than 9,000 chemicals have been tested and there are more than 1,000 high-
throughput assays in the ToxCast database.  
 
This section highlights the ToxCast HTS assays in which gentian violet and 
pentamethylpararosanili ne chloride  (a metabolite of gentian violet which can be present 
at <4% in commercial  gentian violet preparations ) were active.  OEHHA has searched 
the ToxCast database via the Interactive Chemical Safety for Sustainability (iCSS) 
Dashboard ( https://actor.epa.gov/dashboard/ , v2, accessed on 4/24/2018), and 
obtained chemical activity data for gentian violet and pentamethylpararosaniline 
chloride6.  OEHHA found that gentian violet was active in 27 3 of the 794 ToxCast 
assays in which it was tested, and pentamethylpararosaniline chloride was active in 21 
of the 28 assays in which it was tested (Table 10).  The purity of the gentian violet used 
in these assays was typically over 90% hexamethylpararosaniline chloride.  The purity 
of pentamethylpararosaniline chloride used in the ToxCast assays was reported to be < 
14%.

 Aligning active gentian violet ToxCast Assays to IARC’s key characteristics of 
carcinogens  
 
In 2014, the IARC working group for Monograph Volume 112 mapped the ToxCast 
assay end- points available at that time to the key characteristics of carcinogens (IARC 
2017; Smith et al. 2016 ).  IARC has since updated their assay mapping and OEHHA 
obtained IARC’s latest table ( Houck, K., email communication, May 24, 2018), which 
maps a total of 299 assay end- points to seven of the ten key characteristics.  OEHHA 
used IARC’s latest table to map the active ToxCast assays for gentian violet to the key characteristics of carcinogens.  Seventy -two assays in which gentian violet was active 
mapped to five of the ten key character istics of carcinogens (Figure 3  and Appendix C ).

 o Is gen otoxic – G entian violet was active in seven assays targeting cellular TP53 
induction.  Although not a direct measurement of genotoxicity, TP53 is a central 
player in cellular responses to DNA damage and can be activated by genotoxic 
stress ( Speidel 2015). 
o Induces epigenetic alterations  – Gentian violet was active in one assay targeting the 
activation of Sp1 transcription factor, which is overexpressed in many cancers as a 
key regulator in cancer progression.  Sp1 is associated with many cancer -related 
pathways including epigenetic silencing  (Beishline and Azizkhan- Clifford 2015). 
o
 Induces oxidative stress  – Gentian violet was active in three assays measuring 
oxidative stress and four assays targeting the activation of oxidative stress -related 
transcription factors : metal -regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1), nuclear factor 
erythroi d 2-like 2 (NFE2L2 or Nrf2) (two assays), and heat shock transcription factor 
1 (HSF1).  
o Modulates receptor -mediated effects  – Gentian violet was active in 18 assays 
targeting receptor -mediated effects.  The receptors targeted by gentian violet 
include:  
 An drogen receptor (AR) (four assays);  
 Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (four assays);  
 Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; alpha (HNF4A);  
 Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4, (NR1H4);  
 Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group I, member 2 (NR1I2);  
 Nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 (NR3C1, a glucocorticoid 
receptor) (two assays);  
 Peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) (three assays);  
 Thyroid hormone receptor, beta (THRB); and  
 Vitamin D receptor (VDR) (activity tested via the reporter gene CYP24A1, 
which carries VDRE in its promoter).  
o
 Alters cell proliferation, cell death or nutrient supply  –  Gentian violet was active in 
38 assay s measuring cytotoxicity by a wide variety of assay formats in cell lines or 
primary human cells.  Specifically, gentian violet was active in assays mapped to cell cycle (mitotic arrest), cell conformation changes, as well as mitochondrial toxicity by loss of mitochondria membrane potential.  Notably, one of the assays detects 
increased transcription act ivity at AP -1 sites, which reflects activities of proto-
oncogenes such as c -Jun and c -Fos (van Dam and Castellazzi 2001).

Intended target families for gentian violet and pentamethylpararosaniline chloride  
 
The ToxCast HTS assays cover a broad range of potential toxicity mechanisms that are not limited to carcinogenicity, and gentian viol et tested positive in many of these other 
assays.  Biological process categories, or “intended target families” for all active assays 
reported for gentian violet and pentamethylpararosaniline chloride , were obtained from 
the iCSS ToxCast  Dashboard (accessed on 4/24/2018)  and are presented in Tables 11 
and 12, respectively .  Additional  detailed information  about these assays, such as 
specific molecular targets and AC
50 values, are available in Appendix C.

 As shown in Table  11, gentian violet was active in 273 ToxCast assays, including a 
subset of 72 assays that were mapped to key characteristics of carcinogens and 
described earlier.  These 273 assays are related to 17 biological processes or intended 
target families , as shown in the table.  The largest proportions of assays in which 
gentian violet was active were the GPCR, cytokine, and cell cycle/cytotoxicity target 
families.

cytotoxicity, cytochrome P450s, DNA binding, and nuclear receptors.  
 
 
4. MECHANISMS  
Gentian violet may act via multiple mechanisms, which can be grouped according to the 
key characteristics of carcinogens described by Smith et al. (2016) .  These mechanisms 
include being electrophilic or  forming electrophilic metabolites, genotoxicity, oxidative 
stress induction, and rec eptor -mediated effects (Table 13 ).

 Table 13. Ten key characteristics of carcinogens (taken from Smith et al. 2016)  
Characteristic  Example of relevant evidence 
1. Is electrophilic or can be 
metabolically activated Parent compound or metabolite with an electrophilic structure 
(e.g., epoxide, quinone), formation of DNA and protein 
adducts  
2. Is genotoxic  DNA damage (DNA strand breaks, DNA –protein cross -links, 
UDS), intercalation, gene mutations, cytogenetic changes 
(e.g., CAs, MN)  
3. Alters DNA repair or causes genomic instability  Alterations of DNA replication or repair ( e.g., topoisomerase 
II, base -excision or double- strand break repair)  
4. Induces epigenetic 
alterations  DNA methylation, histone modification, microRNA expression 
5. Induces oxidative stress  Oxygen radicals, oxidative stress, oxidative damage to macromolecules ( e.g., DNA, lipids)  
6. Induces chronic inflammation  Elevated white blood cells, myeloperoxidase activity, altered cytokine and/or chemokine production 
7. Is immunosuppressive Decreased immunosurveillance, immune system dysfunction 
8. Modulates receptor -
mediated effects  Receptor inactivation/activation ( e.g., ER, PPAR, AhR) or  
modulation of endogenous ligands (including hormones)  
9. Causes immortalization Inhibition of senescence, cell transformation  
10. Alters cell proliferation, 
cell death, or nutrient supply  Increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, changes in 
growth factors, energetics and signaling pathways related to 
cellular replication or cell cycle control, angiogenesis  
AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator –activated 
receptor.  Any of the 10 characteristics in this table could interact with any other (e.g., oxidative stress, 
DNA damage, and chronic inflammation), which when combined provides stronger evidence for a cancer 
mechanism than would oxidative stress alone.  
 
Gentian violet is a direct -acting electrophile that reacts with DNA and other nucleophiles 
(Muller and Gautier 1975; NCTR 1983 ).  Gentian violet also forms electrophilic 
metabolites.  Free nitrogen-  or carbon- centered radicals can be formed during metabolic 
N-demethylation and reduction reactions and have been observed in vitro  in 
peroxidase- catalyzed reactions, in incubations with cytochrome P450 enzymes in rat 
microsomes or T. cruzi  cells, and as a result of photoinduction in cell -free systems.  
Gentian violet is used as a stain for nuclei (see Section 2.3).  Numerous studies have

 shown that gentian violet  can bind to DNA , specifically to adjacent AT nucleotide pairs  
(Muller and Gautier  1975; see also section 3.3.2 G enotoxicity).  The binding occurs 
externally and causes severe kinking and or bending accompanied by a coupled 
unwinding of the helix (Wakelin et al.  1981).  The ability  to form adducts to nucleic acids 
and proteins is a common property of electrophilic and/or metabolically activated human 
carcinogens . 
 Gentian violet is genotoxic.  Gentian violet has demonstrated bacterial mutagenicity in 
Salmonella and E. coli, clastogenicity in various test systems, and DNA binding and 
damage in human and rodent cells.  In addition, gentian violet is metaboli zed to several 
mutagenic metabolites (pentamethylpararosaniline, N, N,N',N'- and N, N,N',N''- 
tetramethylpararosaniline, leucogentian violet  and leuco- pentamethylpararosaniline) 
and to the genotoxic carc inogens formaldehyde, pararosaniline hydrochloride (C.I. 
Basic Red 9
7), and Michler’s ketone8. 
 
Multiple lines of evidence indicate that g entian violet induces oxidative stress .  In cell -
free systems gentian violet has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species, 
convert ing oxygen to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of visible 
light, and in HRP -catalyzed reactions  (Reszka et al. 1986; Gadelha et al.  1992).   
Reactive oxygen spec ies and other free radicals arising from xenobiotic metabolism 
may play key roles in many of the processes necessary for the conversion of normal cells to cancer cells.   In addition,  several ToxCast HTS assay s showed that gentian 
violet induces oxidative s tress, and activates transcription factors such as Nrf2, whose 
activation is an indicator of cellular antioxidant response.  
 Gentian violet modulates receptor -mediated effects.  Gentian violet was active in 18 
ToxCast HTS assays that were mapped to the key  characteristic of carcinogens 
“modulates receptor -mediated effects” by IARC.  Examples of the receptors that are 
activated by gentian violet include the androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor gamm a (PPARγ), and the thyroid 
hormone receptor beta (THRB) .  Receptor -mediated activation most often results in 
changes in gene transcription.

 5. REVIEWS BY OTHER AGENCIES 
Gentian violet has not been classified as to its potential carcinogenicity by the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , 
the National Toxicology Program (NTP), the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health (NIOSH), or the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).  
 FDA currently permits the use of gentian violet in wound dressings (Edwards 2016; FDA 
2016) .  However, FDA determined that  the use of gentian violet in animal feed is not 
“generally recognized as safe” and considers animal feed containing gentian violet as adulterated (21CFR 589.1000; 21CFR 500.29 ; 21CFR 500.30), based on possible 
carcinogenicity concerns arising from structural similarities to known animal and human 
carcinogens and its mutagenicity.  FDA noted that “Gentian violet is a suspected 
carcinogen, a probable mu tagen, and a potent clastogen” (GAO 1980 ).  FDA includes 
gentian violet in its routine testing of  aquaculture drug residues and has issued import 
alerts (FDA 2008) .  FDA also mentioned “ Gentian violet is not permitted as a color in 
food or feed in the United States. Studies at the National Center for Toxicological Research have shown gentian violet to be a carcinogen for laboratory animals. ” in the 
Compliance Policy Guide Section 578.600,  “Unapproved Additives for Exported Grains ” 
(FDA 1995) . 
 Although not formally reviewed by the NTP, gentian violet was mentioned in the NTP  
(2005)  technical report on the carcinogenicity of malachite green chloride and 
leucomalachite green, and referred to as a “carcinogenic dye” ( NTP 2005, page  63).  In 
addition, t he structural similarity of malachite green to gentian violet was cited as part of 
the rationale for nomination by the FDA  of malachite green and leucomalachite green 
for carcinogenesis testing  by NTP . 
 Gentian violet  was also evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Com mittee on Food 
Additives (JECFA  2014) for its suitability as to whether or not an acceptable daily intake 
(ADI) could be established and whether the continued use of gentian violet in food-producing animals is safe for humans.  The Committee concluded that “it is inappropriate to set an ADI for gentian violet  because it is genotoxic and carcinogenic” 
(JECFA  2014).  
 The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) cancelled the registrations and 
relevant approvals of products containing crystal (gentian) violet after a 1994 special 
review of crystal (gentian) violet  (APVMA 2014 ).  The review  found that crystal (gentian)

 violet posed a potential risk to public health.  According to APVMA, “crystal violet  
“demonstrated carcinogenic/tumorigenic effects in mice in life- span studies. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma, adenoma of the Harderian gland and Type A reticular cell 
sarcomas in multiple sites were found in 18 –24-month -old mice, and in vitro  studies 
revealed that crystal (gentian) violet  is a mutagen and clastogen”.  
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  
6.1 Summary of Evidence  
One hospital -based study conducted in Brazil and published in Portuguese by De 
Sousa et al. (1989)  identified 37 individuals  that had received transfusions of blood 
treated with gentian violet  in the past (i.e., 2 -27 years previously) , based on patient 
recall ( i.e., transfused blood appeared purple).  The researchers examined the medical 
records of these 37 individuals  and determined that 26 out of the 37 had confirmed 
benign or malignant neoplastic lesions .  This study has a number of limitations, 
including lack of information on the site and type of neoplastic lesions observed, lack of 
control subjects, and the likely presence of selection bias  and confounding  factors . 
 One case report published in German described a case of lymphocytic leukemia 
diagnosed in a 57 -year old man five months after he was exposed to ink containing 
gentian violet, as a result of accidentally stabbing  his hand with an ink pen ( Schaeppi 
1955) .  The author assumed a causal link between the injury and the leukemia ; 
however, the report provided no information on the extent to which exposure to gentian 
violet occurred or  on the health status of the individual (e.g., results of complete blood 
cell count or blood work) prior to the accident . 
 Long -term carcinogenicity studies of gentian violet have been conducted in rats and 
mice.  Tumors were observed in two studies in rats and two studies in mice.  These 
findings are as follows:  
 
Liver tumors  
• In the male F344 rats exposed to gentian violet in utero, during lactation, and via 
feed post-weaning for up to 24 months ( Littlefield et al. 1989 ; NCTR 1988 ), the 
incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was  significantly increased in the highest 
dose group by pairwise comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related 
trend.   In addition, one hepatocellular carcinom a was observed in the low -dose 
group.

 • In the male B6C3F1 mice exposed to gentian violet in feed for  up to 24 months 
(Littlefield et al. 1985; NCTR 1983 ),  the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma 
was significantly increased in the mid-  and high- dose groups by pairwise 
comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related tr end.  Hepatocellular  
carcinoma was  significantly increased in the high- dose group by pairwise 
comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related trend.  
• In the female B6C3F1 mice exposed to gentian violet in feed for up to 24 months  
(Littlefield et al. 1985; NCTR 1983 ), the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma 
and carcinoma were both significantly increased in the mid-  and high- dose 
groups by pairwise comparison with controls, with s ignificant dose- related trends.

feed post-weaning for up to 24 months ( Littlefield et al. 1989 ; NCTR 1988 ), the 
incidence of thyroid gland follicular cell adenocarcinoma was  significantly 
increased in the low - and high- dose groups by pairwise comparison with controls, 
with a significant dose- related trend.  The incidence of thyroid gland follicular cell 
adenoma or adenocarcinoma combined was  significantly increased in the highest 
dose group by pairwise comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related 
trend.  
• In the female F344 rats exposed to gentian violet in utero , during lactation, and 
via feed p ost-weaning for up to 24 months (Littlefield et al. 1989; NCTR 1988 ), 
the incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell adenocarcinoma and adenoma or 
adenocarcinoma combined were significantly increased in the mid-  and high-

 Mononuclear cell leukemia 
• In the female F344 rats exposed to gentian violet in utero , during lactation, and 
via feed post -weaning for 18 months (Littlefield et al. 1989; NCTR 1988) , the 
incidence  of mononuclear cell leukemia was  significantly increased in the highest 
dose group by pairwise comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related 
trend.   Although no treatment -related increase in MNCL was apparent in animals 
at 24 months, NCTR (1988) stated that “dosing with gentian violet was 
significantly associated with an earlier  onset and increased mortality due to 
leukemia”.

• In the female F344 rats exposed to gentian violet in utero , during lactation, and 
via feed post -weaning for up to 24 months (Littlefield et al. 1989; NCTR 1988 ), a 
dose- related increase in clitoral gland adenoma or adenocarcinoma combined 
was observed in the mid-  and high- dose groups.  
  
Harderian gland tumors  
• In the male B6C3F1 mice exposed to gentian viol et in feed for up to 24 months  
(Littlefield et al. 1985; NCTR 1983 ), the incidence of Harderian gland adenoma 
was significantly increased in the mid-  and high- dose groups by pairwise 
comparison with controls, with a significant dose- related trend.  
• In the female B6C3F1 mice exposed to gentian violet in feed for up to 24 mo nths

January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 Metabolism of gentian violet can occur by both  oxidative and reductive processes , and 
several of the metabolites formed are mutagenic and/or carcinogenic .  Oxidative 
metabolites of gentian violet have been measured in in vivo  studies of mice, rats, 
chickens, and microbes, and in vitro  studies with liver microsomes isolated from mice, 
rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and chickens.  Reductive metabolites have been measured 
in vivo  in studies of mice, rats, fish and intestinal microflora isolated from rats, mice, and 
humans.  Free radicals can be formed by  either reductive or oxidative metabolism, with 
a carbon- centered free radical formed during reductive metabolism and a nitrogen-
centered radical formed during oxidative metabolism.  C arcinogenic metabolites include 
the known carcinogens formaldehyde, C.I. Basic  Red 9, and Michler’s ketone (the latter 
two are products of microbial metabolism and may be produced by intestinal microflora) .  
Other mutagenic metabolites include pentamethylpararosaniline, N,N,N ',N'- and 
N,N,N' ,N''-tetramethylpararosaniline , which are products of oxidative metabolism, and 
leucogentian violet  and leuco- pentamethylpararosaniline , which are products of 
reductive metabolism.  
 
Gentian violet has tested positive for a number of genotoxicity endpoints:  
• Mutations in Salmonella typhimurium  TA97, TA98, TA100, TA104, and TA1535  
• Mutations and DNA damage in E. coli 
• DNA damage in B. subtilis  
• DNA damage in mouse lymphocytes  
• CAs in CHO , human lymphocytes and HeLa cells, and other mammalian cells  
• Chromosome breakage in CHO and human peripheral  blood cells  
• Binding to chromosomes undergoing mitosis (“mitotic figures”) in human oral 
mucosa tissue  
• Binding to bacterial and bacteriophage DNA  
• Binding to cell -free calf thymus DNA and synthetic polynucleotides  
• Gene amplification in a SV40 -transformed hamster  cell line  
 There is also evidence for the genotoxicity of several m etabolites of gentian violet : 
• Pentamethylpararosaniline chloride (both a metabolite, and a small constituent of 
commercial gentian violet preparations) : 
o Mutations in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97, TA100, TA104, 
and TA1535), and in B . subtilis, E. coli,  and bacteriophage T4D  
o Binding to calf thymus DNA  
• Leucogentian violet : mutations in Salmonella typhimurium  
• Leuco- pentamethylpararosaniline : mutations in Salmonella typhimurium   
• N,N,N',N'-tetrame thylpararosaniline : mutations in Salmonella typhimurium  and E.

o DNA damage, UDS, and DNA binding in rats  
o CAs in CHO and CHE -3N cells

The biological activity of gentian violet was compared to seven  struct urally related 
compounds : pentamethylpararosaniline chloride, C.I. Basic Red 9 (pararosaniline 
hydrochloride), magenta (including magenta I, magenta II, and magenta III), malachite 
green chloride, leucomalachite green, methyl green, and Michler’s ketone.  Of these 
seven comparison compounds, three are classified by IARC as Group 2B carcinogens 
(C.I. Basic Red  9, Michler’s ketone, and Magenta ), and two of th e three are also listed 
as Proposition 65 carcinogens  (C.I. Basic Red 9 and Michler’s ketone) .  Three of the 
tumor types observed to be increased in animal studies of gentian violet  were also 
increased in animal studies of some of the comparison chemicals .  Specifically, 
increases i n hepatocellular tumors were seen with C.I. Basic Red 9, leucomalachite 
green, and Michler’s ketone (with equivocal findings for malachite green chloride); thyroid follicular cell tumors were seen with C.I. Basic Red 9 (with equivocal findings for 
malachit e green chloride and leucomalachite green); and Harderian gland tumors were 
seen with C.I. Basic Red 9.  All of the comparison chemicals were tested for 
genotoxicity, and all except methyl green tested positive.  Specifically, all except methyl green tested positive for  mutagenicity  and DNA damage or binding, and all three of the 
comparison chemicals that were tested for chromosomal effects tested positive (C.I. 
Basic Red 9, malachite green chloride, and Michler’s ketone) .  
Gentian Violet                                              62                                                       OEHHA  
January 2019                                                                                                                                            
 Gentian violet was tested in 794 high -throughput screening assays in the US EPA 
ToxCast database, and was active in 273  assays.  These 273 assays have been 
categorized by US EPA as being related to 17 biological processes  or intended target 
families .  The largest proportions of assays in w hich gentian violet was active were 
related to the GPCR, cytokine, and cell cycle /cytotoxicity target families .  In a separate 
analysis, OEHHA applied information from IARC that maps ToxCast  assay endpoints to 
the key characteristics of carcinogens, and found that  72 of the 273 assays in which 
gentian violet was active mapped to five of the key characteristics of carcinogens .  
Specifically, seven of the nine assays mapped to “is  genotoxic ” were active, one of the 
three assay s mapped to “ induc es epigenetic alterations ” was active , seven of the 15 
assays mapped to “ induc es oxidative stress ” were active, 18 of the 70 assays mapped 
to “modulat es receptor -mediated effects ” were active, and 39 of the 69 assays mapped 
to “alters cell proliferation, cell death, or nutrient supply ” were active.  
 
Gentian violet may act via multiple mechanisms, including  being electrophilic or forming 
electrophilic metabolites, genotoxicity, oxidative stress induction, and rec eptor -mediated 
effects . 
• Gentian violet is a direct acting electrophile  that reacts with DNA and other 
nucleophiles .  Gentian violet also forms electrophilic metabolites, such as free 
nitrogen-  or carbon- centered radicals formed during metabolic N -demethylation 
and reduction reactions.  
• Gentian violet is genotoxic , as summarized above.  
• Gentian violet induces oxidative stress by forming reactive oxygen species .  In 
addition, g entian v iolet is active in seven ToxCast HTS assays that have been 
mapped to this key characteristic . 
• Gentian violet can modulate receptor -mediated effects , based on its activity in 18 
ToxCast HTS assays that have been mapped to th is key characteristic.

 Appendix A. Literature Search Strategies on the Carcinogenicity of Gentian Violet  
General searches of the literature on the carcinogenicity of gentian violet were 
conducted to identify peer -reviewed open- source and proprietary journal articles, print 
and digital books, reports, and gray literature that potentially reported relevant toxicological and epidemiological information on the carcinogenicity of this chemical.  The search sought to identify all literature relevant to the assessment of evidence on the 
carcinogenicity of gentian violet.  
Search Process  
Relevant subject terms w ere entered into the PubMed Search Builder to execute a 
search.  
The following is a typical chemical search strategy used to search PubMed:  
(“chemical name” [MeSH] OR “CAS registry number” [RN]) AND 
("bioassay"[MeSH] OR "carcinogenicity"[MeSH] OR "cancer"[M eSH] OR 
"tumor"[MeSH]) OR "neoplasm"[MeSH]) OR "genotoxicity"[MeSH]) OR 
"mutagenicity"[MeSH]) OR "metabolism"[MeSH]) OR "absorption"[MeSH]) OR 
"pharmacokinetics"[MeSH]) OR "structure activity relationship"[MeSH])  
ChemID plus (https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus
), a ToxNet database,  was used to 
search for synonyms of gentian violet.  
In PubMed, MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms at the top of hierarchical lists of 
subject headings are automatically “expl oded” in a search to retrieve citations with more 
specific MeSH terms.  For example, the heading “carcinogenicity” includes broad 
conditions that are related to cancer induction in animals and humans.  
Additional databases and other data sources listed below were then searched.  The 
search strategies were tailored according to the search features unique to each 
database  and data source .  Web of Science, for example, was searched by entering 
chemical terms and refining the search by applying Web of  Science categories 
Toxicology and/or Public, Environmental and Occupational Health.  The search term 
used includes either the CAS registry number or the chemical name and its available synonyms.   Sometimes other databases and data sources not listed here were 
searched as needed.  
Relevant literature was also identified from citations in individual articles.

JECFA's 
summary of Levin, Lovely & Klekowski (1982) studied the effect of light (plates 
gentoxocity containing gentian violet were irradiated at 23°C with a Sylvania tungsten/starts here halogen lamp for 3 minutes at 20 cm) on the genotoxicity of gentian violet. In 
the Rosenkranz assay, a genotoxic effect was observed under conditions of dark and was enhanced by the irradiation. Harrelson & Mason (1982) reported that in the presence of NADPH and light, gentian violet was photoreduced to the same triarylmethyl free radical that is formed by enzymatic reduction. The presence of S9 had no effect on the genotoxicity of gentian violet. However, in the Ames test, where no mutagenic activity was observed but gentian violet was sufficiently toxic to sterilize the plate under conditions of dark incubation, the presence of S9 (active or thermally deactivated) virtually eliminated the toxicity of gentian violet under dark incubation and greatly decreased its toxicity under light conditions.

JECFA's 
summary of genotoxicity ends here Thomas & MacPhee (1984) pointed out that all of the strains used by 
Au et al. (1979) and Bonin, Farquharson & Baker (1981) carried rfa mutations 
and were exceptionally sensitive to the toxic effects of gentian violet and thus 
not the most suitable strains to assess the mutagenicity of gentian violet, other than at very low dose levels. These authors reported negative results with Salmonella typhimurium  strain TA1535 in the Ames assay using low doses 
(0.025–0.5 μg/plate) of gentian violet because of the toxic effects of gentian violet 
and thus disagreed with the positive results by Bonin, Farquharson & Baker (1981). However, the authors concluded that the positive results with DG1669 (an Escherichia coli K12 derivative that carries the  lacZ(ICR24) frameshift 
marker and is DNA repair proficient) indicated that gentian violet is a direct-acting mutagen causing frameshift mutations in repair-proficient bacteria. Dose levels of 75 and 100 μg/plate were toxic when S9 was omitted, but not when S9 was 
present in the incubation mixture. 
Aidoo et al. (1990) re-evaluated the genotoxicity of gentian violet (> 96% 
gentian violet, with the remainder being mainly methyl violet) by conducting mutagenesis and DNA damage experiments in both bacterial and mammalian cell systems. Mutagenicity of gentian violet in Salmonella  was strain specific; it 
was mutagenic in TA97 and TA104 strains, but not in TA98 and TA100 strains. S9 tended to increase its mutagenicity. N,N,N′ ,N″-Tetramethylpararosaniline, a 
metabolite of gentian violet, was a weak mutagen in Salmonella . Gentian violet 
was not mutagenic in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line CHO-K1-BH
4, but 
equivocal results were obtained with CHO-AS52 cells. Gentian violet produced DNA damage in B6C3F1 mouse lymphocytes in vitro, but not in vivo. However, the dose levels used in these in vivo tests were much lower than those used in the carcinogenicity studies. The authors concluded that gentian violet is a point mutagen in bacteria and may be carcinogenic in mammalian cells by its clastogenic activity. 
Gentian violet was found to break chromosomes in cultures of CHO cells 
(Au et al., 1978; Au & Hsu, 1979), human lymphocytes, HeLa and L cells and fibroblastic cell lines (Au et al., 1978).

(a) Multigeneration reproductive toxicity 
(i) Rats 
In a three-generation reproductive toxicity study, gentian violet (99% gentian 
violet, 1% methyl violet) was administered in feed to Fischer 344 rats at a dose of 0, 
100, 300 or 600 mg/kg (equivalent to 0, 5, 15 and 30 mg/kg bw per day, respectively). F
0 animals of both sexes were randomly allocated to treatment groups and fed the 
medicated ration for at least 80 days. Males and females of the same dose group were then caged together for 14 days for mating, after which males were returned to their own cages. Pups from this mating (F
1a generation) were used for a separate 
study. Following this, 90 rats of each sex for the control group and 45 rats of each sex for each treatment group were selected to continue in this study. F

 28 GENTIAN VIOLET 
JECFA's 
evaluation/ conclusion on genotoxicity starts here There were few data available on the acute and short-term toxicity of gentian 
violet, but the reported range of LD50s, from 100 to 800 mg/kg bw, shows that it is 
of moderate acute oral toxicity. The most common sign of toxicity was lethargy, 
followed by anorexia and, in some animals, diarrhoea, excessive thirst, emesis and weight loss. In 90-day studies in rats and dogs, the only reported signs were slight body weight loss and increased liver weight, respectively. 
In a 24-month study, gentian violet was given to mice in the feed at a 
concentration of 0, 100, 300 or 600 mg/kg (equal to 0, 10.7–14.3, 32.1–35.7 and 64.3 mg/kg bw per day for males and 0, 14.3, 35.7–39.3 and 71.4 mg/kg bw per day for females, respectively). Few dose-related non-neoplastic lesions were reported, but there were statistically significant dose-related increases in erythropoiesis in the spleen and atrophy of the ovaries in females at 24 months. The LOAEL for non-carcinogenic effects was 14.3 mg/kg bw per day, the lowest dose tested. Significant, dose-related increases in neoplastic lesions were observed in both sexes, with the female mice being more sensitive. Hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were the most common lesions, with significant, dose-related increases found at 24 months in males and at both 18 and 24 months in females. Mortality due to liver neoplasms showed positive trends in both males and females, and there was a dose-related decrease in the time for the onset of liver neoplasms. The females also showed statistically significant dose-related increases in adenoma of the Harderian gland and in type A reticulum cell sarcoma in the urinary bladder, uterus, ovaries and vagina. The data clearly indicate that gentian violet is a multisite carcinogen in the mouse. 
In a long-term study of toxicity, rats were exposed to gentian violet in the 
feed at a concentration of 0, 100, 300 or 600 mg/kg (equal to approximately 0, 30, 80 and 160 mg/kg bw per day for males and 0, 40, 100 and 200 mg/kg bw per day for females, respectively). Gentian violet exposure of these animals was achieved by dosing the parents of the study animals prior to and during mating, with the same dose fed to the offspring from weaning up to 24 months of age. There was a statistically significant increase in liver regeneration in all dose groups and statistically significant dose-related increases in eosinophilic foci in the liver in both sexes in both the mid- and high-dose groups. For liver centrilobular necrosis, there was a dose-related increase, but statistical significance was seen only in the 300 mg/kg feed group in males and in the 600 mg/kg feed group in females. As in mice, female rats appeared to be more sensitive than males. The incidence of thyroid adenocarcinoma was increased in males, with statistical significance at the top dose only at 24 months. Females showed a statistically significant dose–response relationship for thyroid adenocarcinoma at 24 months. The incidence of hepatocellular adenomas showed a small but significant dose–response relationship in males and a significant increase in females at 300 mg/kg feed, but not at other doses. The data indicate a carcinogenic response to gentian violet in rats, although much weaker than the response in mice. 
The data show that gentian violet binds to DNA, and this, together with the 
cellular toxicity of gentian violet, complicates both the testing of gentian violet in vitro and the interpretation of the results. The results are somewhat varied in Salmonella 
typhimurium , with positive responses in some strains but not in others. Gentian violet 
was clastogenic in vitro and positive in indicator tests for DNA damage. There are few in vivo tests on gentian violet. A single in vivo test for clastogenicity (mouse

JECFA's evaluation/ 
conclusion on genotoxicity 
ends here bone marrow assay) showed no evidence of clastogenic activity, but the Committee 
noted that the gentian violet was given via the drinking-water at lower doses (4 and 8 mg/kg bw per day) than those used in the mouse cancer bioassay (ranging from 10 to 70 mg/kg bw per day). Similarly, the other in vivo test on DNA damage in mouse lymphocytes using single intravenous doses up to 6 mg/kg bw showed no effect. The Committee concluded that, overall, the data show that gentian violet is genotoxic. 
In view of the carcinogenicity of gentian violet in the mouse and rat and evidence 
showing genotoxicity in a number of tests, the Committee concluded that gentian violet should be considered a carcinogen acting by a genotoxic mode of action. 
In a multigeneration reproductive toxicity study, rats were given gentian 
violet in the feed at a concentration of 0, 100, 300 or 600 mg/kg (equivalent to 0, 5, 15 and 30 mg/kg bw per day, respectively) over three generations. There were significant reductions in body weight in the top dose group in all generations. The NOAEL for parental toxicity was 15 mg/kg bw per day. In the F
3a generation, 
examined for histopathological effects, a dose-related trend for focal dilatation of the renal cortex and tubules, a statistically significant dose-related trend for necrosis of the thymus and an inverse dose–response relationship for red pulp haematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen were seen. The effects in the F
3a 
generation were present in all dose groups, and a NOAEL for offspring toxicity could not be determined. Gentian violet had no effect on the number of pups per litter, fertility index, pup survival, sex ratio or number of stillborn animals. The NOAEL for reproductive toxicity was 30 mg/kg bw per day, the highest dose tested. 
Two developmental toxicity studies were conducted in rats. In the first study, 
CD rats were given gentian violet at 0, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg bw per day by oral gavage on days 6–15 of gestation. In the second study, the three-generation study in Fischer 344 rats described above, the F
3b generation was examined for teratogenic effects. 
In that study, gentian violet was given in the feed at a concentration of 0, 100, 300 or 600 mg/kg (equivalent to 0, 5, 15 and 30 mg/kg bw per day, respectively). CD rats appeared to be more sensitive than Fischer 344 rats to the toxicity of gentian violet, with dose-related reductions in maternal weight gain at 5 and 10 mg/kg bw per day and increased clinical signs of toxicity, significant at 10 mg/kg bw per day and limited at 5 mg/kg bw per day (maternal toxicity NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw per day). In Fischer 344 rats, reduction in body weight was seen only at 30 mg/kg bw per day and not at lower doses of 5 and 15 mg/kg bw per day (maternal toxicity NOAEL of 15 mg/kg bw per day). It was also noted that malformations (hydroureter, hydronephrosis and short ribs) were seen only in the CD rats. Effects on the fetus were seen only at doses that also caused maternal toxicity. The NOAEL for embryo and fetal toxicity in CD rats was 5 mg/kg bw per day. 
In a developmental toxicity study, rabbits were given gentian violet at 
0, 0.5, 1 or 2 mg/kg bw per day by oral gavage on days 6–19 of gestation. Maternal mortality was increased in a dose-related manner, and maternal body weight gain was decreased in all treated groups compared with controls. Fetal weights were significantly reduced in all treated groups compared with controls. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects. Owing to the presence of maternal toxicity and significantly reduced fetal weights in all dosed groups, NOAELs could not be identified for maternal or embryo/fetal toxicity.

The BMD10 values from the accepted models ranged from 19.9 to 
25.2 mg/kg bw per day, and the BMDL10 values ranged from 16.8 to 19.8 mg/kg 
bw per day (Table 16). In order to be prudent, the Committee decided to use the 
more conservative lower end of this range of values for the evaluation and chose a BMDL
10 value of 16.8 mg/kg bw per day as the reference point for a margin of 
exposure (MOE) calculation. 
The Committee estimated MOEs assuming a residue level of 0.5 μg/kg, 
which is a typical limit of quantification for gentian violet residues in foods, and a residue level of 5 μg/kg, which is 10 times the typical limit of quantification, as a 
hypothetical scenario. Assuming a daily consumption of 300 g of fish contaminated with gentian violet and its metabolites, the estimated theoretical exposures to gentian violet for a 60 kg person were 0.0025 and 0.025 μg/kg bw per day for the 
two residue levels, respectively. Comparison of these estimated exposures with the BMDL
10 of 16.8 mg/kg bw per day indicates MOEs of about 6.7 × 106 and 
6.7 × 105, respectively. Based on considerations discussed at the sixty-fourth 
meeting of the Committee for unintended contaminants (Annex 1, reference 176), 
these MOEs would be considered to be of low concern for human health. 
However, the Committee noted that there were a number of uncertainties 
associated with the risk assessment, some of which were substantial. The uncertainties relate to two aspects of the data available for risk assessment. Firstly, there were insufficient residue data in food-producing animals or the environment from which to estimate dietary exposure to gentian violet, and hence assumptions had to be made. Secondly, there is very little information on the proportion of gentian violet and its metabolites in the total residue and on the carcinogenicity of the metabolites. For example, there is a published report that one of the possible metabolites of gentian violet, demethylated leucopararosaniline, is carcinogenic in rats, but no information is available on its potency. In addition, there is no information on the carcinogenicity of the major metabolite, leucogentian violet. The structure of gentian violet is similar to that of malachite green, and it is known that leucomalachite green is a more potent carcinogen than malachite green; therefore, it is possible that leucogentian violet is similarly a more potent carcinogen than gentian violet. Gentian violet and leucogentian violet are readily interconvertible in the body, and so it is likely that exposure to gentian violet will also result in exposure to leucogentian violet. Thus, there is inadequate information to determine the overall carcinogenicity of the metabolites of gentian violet (demethylated gentian violet, leucogentian violet and its demethylated metabolites).
