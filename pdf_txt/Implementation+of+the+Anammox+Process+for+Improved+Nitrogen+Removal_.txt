Anaerob ammonium oksidasjon (Anammox) for 
fjerning av nitrogen fra ulike avløpsstrømmer er 
en relativt ny prosess som er blitt utviklet i løpet 
av de siste ca 20 år. Det gjenstår imidlertid mange 
uavklarte spørsmål og tilhørende FoU-oppgaver 
knyttet bl.a. til Anammox-bakterienes metabo-
lisme og hvordan disse bakteriene kan utnyttes 
på best mulig måte i fullskala renseanlegg for fjerning av nitrogen. Dette gjelder ikke minst 
hvordan prosessen kan utvikles til å fjerne nitro-
gen fra vanlig kommunalt avløpsvann, og ikke 
bare fra «sidestrømmer» med høyt ammonium-innhold og høy temperatur.
Sammenlignet med konvensjonelle metoder 
for fjerning av nitrogen fra kommunalt avløps -
vann (nitrifikasjon/denitrifikasjon) er Anam -
mox-prosessen svært energibesparende, og det 
er ingen behov for en karbonkilde, slik denitri -
fikasjonsprosessen krever. Dette vil gi mulighe -
ter for å ta ut så mye som mulig av det organiske 
materialet i avløpsvannet som primærslam og 
produsere fornybar energi av dette i form av bio -
gass. Dersom man lykkes med å implementere 
Anammox-prosessen for fjerning av nitrogen fra 
kommunalt avløpsvann, vil dette innebære en 
kraftig økning av bærekraften til avløpsrense -
anlegg, og det er ikke lenger utopisk å se på avløps -
renseanlegg som en netto energiprodusent. Summary
Although the study of the Anammox process has 
been ongoing for about 20 years and knowledge 
about Anammox bacteria has significantly increa-
sed, there are still many questions regarding bacte ria behaviour and process performance 
involving these bacteria. Therefore, Anammox 
bacteria still require further research.
Conventional wastewater nitrogen removal 
systems require a lot of energy for nitrification, 
and often an external organic carbon source for 
denitrification. The application of the Anammox 
process (which significantly reduces the need for 
energy and does not need organic matter to con -
vert nitrogen to gas) in the main stream of a wastewater treatment plant would be a great alternative to save energy costs for aeration. 
Moreover, the organic matter present in waste -
water could be regarded as a source of additional 
energy. Such a sustainable approach is now intensely studied around the world. Its imple -
mentation seems to be a revolution in the field 
of sustainable wastewater treatment. This brings 
a vision that soon the pollutants in the waste -
water will no longer be seen as a problem, but as 
a source of renewable energy.

The a nammox process for nitrogen removal from 
wastewater – achievements and future challenges
   
Av Beata Szatkowska and Bjarne Paulsrud
Beata Szatkowska and Bjarne Paulsrud  both work with Aquateam COWI AS.nitrogen is one of the compounds that are regu-
lated in the discharge permit of Wastewater 
Treat  ment Plants (WWTPs) in many countries. 
There are in the nature groups of bacteria which 
are well known and have been widely applied in biological wastewater treatment systems. One of 
them, the nitrifiers, has  the ability to oxidise 
ammonium with oxygen into nitrite which is next oxidised into nitrates (nitrification). The 
second group of bacteria, the denitrifiers, reduces 
oxidized forms of nitrogen in response to the oxi-
dation of an electron donor such as organic 
matter (denitrification). Both processes involve 
large expenditures: nitrification requires aeration, 
and denitrification needs supply of organic 
matter if not sufficient in incoming wastewater.
 However, in the last few decades our under -
standing of the nitrogen cycle on the earth has 
changed drastically, and therefore the concept of 
biological wastewater treatment has evolved 
rapidly. New and more sustainable solutions for 
wastewater treatment have appeared, since more 
effective and autotrophic bacteria responsible for 
the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anam -
mox) reaction has been discovered. Before these 
bacteria were identified by micro-biologists, the 
existence of Anammox bacteria was predicted in 
1977 by Engelbert Broda, who pointed out 
an aerobic ammonium oxidisers as “missing in 
nature”, based on thermodynamic considera -
tions.
The first evidence of anaerobic ammonium 
oxidation to dinitrogen gas was obtained from a 
denitrifying fluidized-bed reactor system 
(Mulder et al., 1995). It was discovered that these 
organisms related to Planctomycetales were 
capable of oxidizing ammonium using nitrite 
instead of O2 as the electron acceptor (Strous et 
al., 1999a). Moreover, it occurred that these 
microorganisms have a number of unique featu -
res, including the use of hydrazine (N2H4, i.e., 
rocket fuel and normally poisonous to living 
organisms) as a free catabolic intermediate. 
The discovery of the Anammox bacteria 
changed the view of the nitrogen cycle and resul -
ted in a remarkably active wastewater treatment 
research around the world. The a nammox reaction
The overall reaction 1, half reactions 2, 3 and 4 
(Kartal et al., 2011) and reaction 5 with cell synt -
hesis proposed by Strous at al. (1998), are presen-
ted below:NH
4+ + NO2- = N2 + 2H2O (reaction 1)
NO2- + 2H+ + e- = NO + H2O (reaction 2)
NO + NH4++ + 2H+ + 3e- = N2H4 + H2O  
 (reaction 3)
N2H4 = N2 + 4H+ + 4e-  (reaction 4)
NH4+ + 1.32NO2- + 0.066HCO3- + 0.13H+ → 
1.02N2 + 0.26NO3- + 0.066CH2O0.5N0.15 + 
2.03H2O  (reaction 5)
The first step involves the reduction of nitrite to 
nitric oxide by nitrate reductase (reaction 2). Then 
ammonium is combined with nitric oxide by hydrazine hydrolase to the form of hydrazine 
(reaction 3). In the final step (reaction 4) hydrazine is 
oxidised to dinitrogen gas via hydrazine/hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (Kartal et al., 
2011). The Anammox reaction is always associated 
with nitrate production. These reactions occur 
within the anammoxosome, a specialized pseudo-
organelle within the bacterium, and create a proton gradient across the anammoxosome 
membrane (van Niftrik et al., 2008). Research  ers 
propose different stoichiometrical quotients for 
individual components of the Anammox reac-
tions but always the same and important for the 
process is nitrite to ammonium ratio (NAR) 
which is equal to 1.3. Moreover, similarities are 
visible in released nitrogen: per 2.3 moles of 
ammonium and nitrite, about 1 mole of nitrogen 
gas (N2) is generated. From reaction 5 it can be 
seen that 0.066 mole of carbon is fixed per 1 mole 
of oxidized ammonium, which equals to 1 carbon 
per 15 catabolic cycles. Anammox bacteria are 
obligate anaerobic chemolithoautotrophs. 
Microbial characteristics
Anammox bacteria have complicated and not yet 
well understood microbiology (Kartal et al., 
 187  Vann  I 02 2014 
Innsendte artIkler
2012). Bacteria share numerous properties with 
both eukaryotes and archaea. Particularly note-
worthy is the exceptional construction of a cell 
which is divided into three separate compart-
ments by bilayer membranes and consists of the 
cell wall, paryphoplasm, riboplasm, and anam -
moxosome. The knowledge about the composi-
tion or function of both the cell wall and the 
paryphoplasm compartment is limited. The 
Anammox reaction takes place in the anammo-
xosome which occupies most of the cell volume 
and is a so-called “prokaryotic organelle” (Lindsay et al., 2001). The current knowledge about Anammox cell biology is presented by 
Niftrik and Jetten (2012). 
So far 10 Anammox species have been identi -
fied. Known species are divided into 5 genera: 
(1) Kuenenia, represented by Kuenenia stutt -
gartiensis; (2) Brocadia including 3 species: B. anammoxidans, B. fulgida, and B. sinica; (3) 
Anammoxoglobus, 1 species: A. propionicus; (4) 
Jettenia 1 species: J. asiatica; and (5) Scalindua 
having 4 species: S. brodae, S. sorokinii, S. wag -
neri, and S. profunda (Kartal et al., 2013). 
 Phylogenetic analysis places them all within the 
phylum Planctomycete. 
All the five currently recognized genera of 
Anammox bacteria share unique physiological 
and morphological features with the key one 
being the presence of the anammoxosome. 
Nearly two thousands of these gene sequences of 
16S rRNA affiliated with Anammox bacteria have been deposited in the GenBank ( http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ ) (Kartal et al., 
2012; 2013) .
anammox in the natural 
ecosystems
After the first identification of the Anammox 
bacteria, its occurrence was affirmed in different 
reactor configurations (Jetten et al., 1999; Helmer 
et al., 1999; Strous et al., 1999b) and followed by 
detection in the natural environments such as 
marine sediments (Dalsgaard et al., 2002, 2003; 
Engström, 2004; Kuypers et al., 2003). There the 
Anammox bacteria are estimated to be, in parti-
cular in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), the major source of nitrogen release into the atmo-
sphere from the oceans (Kartal et al., 2010). The 
Anammox bacterial population was even found 
in deep marine hypersaline gradient systems 
(Borin et al., 2013). Moreover, it was detected in 
terrestrial ecosystems as marshes, lakeshores, a 
contaminated porous aquifer, permafrost soil, 
agricultural soil and in samples associated with 
nitrophilic or nitrogen-fixing plants (Humbert et 
al., 2010). It has even been estimated that about 
50% of the annual fixed nitrogen loss on the earth 
could be attributed to Anammox activity (Lam & 
Kuypers, 2011). In the natural environment the 
Anammox process has been reported to occur at 
temperatures as low as −2.5°C in sea ice (Dals-
gaard and Thamdrup, 2002; Rysgaard and Glud, 
2004) and as high as 70°C in hot springs and hydrothermal vent areas (Byrne et al., 2009, 
Jaeschke et al., 2009).
Metabolism inhibition
As Anammox bacteria favour anaerobic condi -
tions, the Anammox process is reversibly inhibi-
ted by the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. 
The effect of oxygen on process performance is 
described in the following sub-chapter. The effect 
of oxygen on Anammox bacteria has been exa-
mined in marine ecosystems (OMZs). The results 
showed that oxygen is a major controling factor 
for Anammox activity in OMZ waters (Kalvelage 
et al., 2011).
Despite the fact that nitrite is a substrate for 
Anammox bacteria, its concentration can slow 
down, or at higher concentrations, completely (but reversibly) stop cellular metabolism. It is clear that nitrite has a negative effect on the 
Anammox process albeit given inhibitory nitrite 
concentration levels and process recovery times 
vary (Strous et al., 1999a; Dapena-Mora et al., 
2007; Szatkowska et al., 2007a; Bettazzia et al., 
2010; Lotti et al., 2012). Strous et al. (1999a)  
reported that addition of catalytic amounts of hydrazine or hydroxylamine to the culture medium may bring back inactive Anammox bacteria. However, the research conducted by Schalk et al. (1998) showed that presence of 
hydrazine in a bioreactor reduces the viability of 
 188  Vann  I 02 2014

Anammox bacteria despite the fact that hydra -
zine is the key process intermediate. 
Based on studies performed with Anammox 
enrichment cultures from wastewater, methanol 
has been suggested as a next specific inhibitor of 
the Anammox process (Güven et al., 2005). It 
caused complete and irreversible loss of activity 
at concentrations of ≥0.5 mM. Tang et al. (2009) 
indicated the inhibitory effects of high pH and 
free ammonia on Anammox bacteria. It was sug -
gested that free ammonia particularly contribu -
tes to the destabilization of the Anammox 
bioreactor seeded with anaerobic granular 
sludge during the first days of the process start-up. 
The inhibitory effect of unknown compounds 
alleged to be associated with soluble inert COD 
(chemical oxygen demand) in sludge liquor from 
dewatering of digested sludge preceded by ther -
mal hydrolysis was reported by Figdore et al. (2011). The Anammox process is successfully 
implemented for sludge liquor treatment in full-
scale operation. However, the impact of any process prior to the anaerobic digestion, as instal  lation of thermal hydrolysis (associated 
with feed solids characteristics and temperature 
of the thermal hydrolysis) or change in perfor -
mance of the digestion process (e.g. thermophi -
lic temperatures) is not fully known. Process performance
Over the years, the Anammox process has been 
tested for treatment of different types of highly 
concentrated ammonium streams, such as land-
fill leachate (Wyffels et al.,  2004), piggery manure 
(Hwang et al., 2005), digested fish canning efflu-
ents (Dapena-Mora et al., 2006) and tannery was-
tewater (Hulshof, 2007). However, the Anammox 
process has been most successfully implemented 
as a sidestream process for treating centrate and 
filtrate (reject water) streams from dewatering 
anaerobically digested biosolids. High ammonia 
concentrations and relatively high temperature 
typically found in these reject water streams 
make them ideal candidates for this process. The 
Anammox bacteria use CO 2 as their carbon 
source for growth and hence do not require orga-
nic carbon. The nitrite required for their growth 
may be provided by aerobic ammonium oxidi-
zing bacteria or archaea (Francis et al., 2007). 
As mentioned before, the Anammox process 
needs anoxic conditions, and the DO is one of 
the key factors influencing this process as its 
excess inhibits the process. Particularly, oxygen 
is significant in single stage reactor systems 
where the Anammox process occurs simultane -
ously with nitrite production (from ammonium 
oxidation), figure 1. Here the dual properties of 
a biofilm are used. Such system configuration

where Anammox bacteria in the inner layer are 
protected from oxygen by nitrifiers in the outer 
layer seems to be most commonly used in the 
world. Proper adjustment of the oxygen concen -
tration results in the optimum nitrite produc -
tion sufficient for the Anammox process (Cema 
et al., 2011). It was proved that the nitrite pro -
duction rate is the rate-limiting step for the 
Anammox process and the overall reaction in a single stage system (Szatkowska et al., 2007b).
Currently, processes which involve Anam -
mox bacteria are designed to treat wastewaters 
with high ammonium concentration at tempe -
ratures 25 – 40 °C. The implementation of this 
technology for nitrogen removal at lower tempe -
ratures would lead to a more sustainable treat -
ment solution with energy, cost and carbon 
emission savings. Therefore, a laboratory study 
on process performance with possible high 
nitrogen removal at lower temperatures was con -
ducted and proved the Anammox adaptability 
to lower temperatures (Szatkowska and Płaza, 2006). Experiments ran by Hu et al. (2013) 
showed a possibility of 90% nitrogen removal by 
the Anammox process at temperature of 12°C. 
The combined partial nitritation/Anammox 
process can save up to 60 % of the oxygen demand (energy for aeration), reduce biomass production by 80%, and there is no alkalinity requirements compared to the nitrification/denitrification processes. With this combined process, less CO
2 emission is recorded as the 
Anammox process itself consumes CO 2. Table 1 
presents a comparison of the Anammox process 
in combination with the SHARON process 
(Single reactor system for High activity Ammo -nium Removal Over Nitrite) and conventional 
nitrification/denitrification. 
Reported nitrogen removal rate for the par -
tial nitritation/Anammox process in full scale operation varies in the range of 0.3-0.6 kgN 
m-3·d-1 for different process configurations (Gus -
tavsson, 2010). For the Anammox process itself, 
in full scale application, the removal rate was as 
much as 9.5 kgN m-3·d-1 (van der Star et al., 2007). 
Due to the fact that the Anammox bacteria 
are characterized by a very low maximum 
growth rate of 0.0027 h-1 and a doubling time of 
at least 11 days (Strous et al., 1998), a system 
where an Anammox culture is cultivated requi -
res long biomass retention time. The Anammox organisms are extremely slow growing, and the 
process is slow to start without seed organisms 
from an operating facility. Currently, the  seeding 
strategy is one of the most effective methods to 
shorten start-up of the process. The development 
of the process results in a growing number of full-scale plants what facilitates the access to 
already working bacterial cultures. The enrich -
ment time of Anammox bacteria is very long and 
varies between 60 – 150 days for laboratory scale 
(Zhang et al., 2008) and lasted up to 1250 day for 
the first full-scale application in the Netherlands 
(van der Star et al., 2007). Long start-up time of 
the process is one of the few, but important, 
process drawbacks and therefore still a field of 
research.
Process configurations
Many systems configurations applying Anam-mox bacteria have been tested by different 
research  ers in recent years. The major difference

between them is whether the complete process is 
run in two separate steps – partial nitritation in 
reactor one followed by Anammox in reactor 
two, or the processes are accomplished in one 
single reactor. The second difference is the bact-
eria growth type (granular sludge, activated 
sludge, biofilm) and the reactor type, see table 2.
Very often combined processes of partial 
nitritation and Anammox are called deammo -
nification, independently of whether the process 
is run in one single or in two separate steps. Cur -
rently, the most commonly used and already 
applied in several full-scale systems are: DEMON, 
SHARON-Anammox, ANITA-Mox and DeAm -
mon.
DEMON is based on a suspended growth 
activated sludge process, SBR (sequencing batch 
reactor) where the nitritation and Anammox 
processes occur simultaneously (one step process). 
The aeration is controlled intermittently out of a 
narrow pH range and low oxygen content (Wett 
et al. 2007). Due to the fact that the Anammox 
bacteria tend to grow as relatively heavy granu -
les, which allows for the possibility of separating 
them from other ammonia and nitrite oxidizing 
bacteria, the process uses a hydrocyclone which 
separates Anammox granules in the excess 
sludge and recirculates granules back to the SBR 
(Wett et al., 2010). The DEMON process was developed and patented by the University of 
Innsbruck.
The SHARON-Anammox process is a two-
stage suspended growth process implementing 
a SHARON reactor (proper adjustment of tem -
perature, pH, and retention time allows to select 
nitrifying bacteria and to prevent nitrate forma -tion) (Mulder et al., 2001), followed by an anoxic 
Anammox reactor. The SHARON is operated in 
completely mixed reactors without sludge reten -
tion, while the Anammox reactor uses an upflow 
solids granulation process to generate biomass 
that will be retained despite of the low growth 
rate of Anammox bacteria ( van der Star et al., 
2007) .
The Anita-MOX and DeAmmon processes 
use carrier media allowing for biofilm growth on the protected surface area, allowing the 
Anammox organisms to retain in the system. In 
these attached growth systems, nitritation takes 
place in the outer biofilm layer while the Anam -
mox bacteria are found in the inner biomass.
anammox in the main 
wastewater stream
Due to the fact that Anammox is a process which 
enables significant cost savings, researchers have 
started to investigate its implementation for the 
main wastewater stream of WWTPs. Many ques-
tions are addressed to researchers regarding this 
issue (Gustavsson et al., 2012), and the main 
challenges are: the inhibition of nitrite oxidizing 
bacteria (NOB) growth for the partial nitritation, 
the relatively lower temperature and ammonia 
concentrations in municipal wastewater compa-
red to the sludge liquor streams, and the need for 
selective retention of Anammox bacteria. However, the first full-scale plants with the 
DEMON process have been tested at the Strass 
WWTP in Austria and at Glarnerland WWTP in 
Switzerland, where a sidestream process provides 
seed for inoculation of the main stream with DEMON-sludge (Wett et al., 2010, 2013). This

solution is named EssDe, which stands for 
Energy self-sufficient by DEMON. Research on 
implementation of Anammox in the main was-
tewater stream takes also place in the Nether -
lands and in Sweden, where the Manammox 
(mainstream Anammox) concept is tested.
