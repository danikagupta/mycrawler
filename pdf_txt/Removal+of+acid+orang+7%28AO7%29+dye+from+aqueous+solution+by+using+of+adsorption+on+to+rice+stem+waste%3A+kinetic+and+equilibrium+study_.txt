Abstract 
Background and Purpose:  Recently, release of pollutants such as pharmaceuti cals to the 
environment becomes one of the most important probl ems for soil and water. The present study 
was conducted to introduce walnut shell-based activ ated carbon (AC) as a new low-cost 
adsorbent for the removal of cephalexin (CFX) antib iotic from aqueous solutions. 
Materials and Methods:  This study was conducted in laboratory scale. To in vestigation of the 
morphology of the prepared walnut shell AC and nano particles, scanning electron microscopy 
analysis was applied. The effect of the presence of  Fe 2O3 and SiO 2 nanoparticles on the 
adsorption of CFX on the walnut shell AC is also st udied . 
Results:  The maximum removal efficiency (RE) was obtained 98 .4% at 100 mg/L initial CFX 
concentration and decreased to 72.9% with increasin g in the initial CFX concentration to 200 
mg/L. The results showed that the presence of nanop articles in the optimum increased the RE of 
CFX by about 2.1 and 6.5% for Fe 2O3 and SiO 2 nanoparticles, respectively. 
Conclusion:  Results suggest the potential of using the walnut shell AC as an adsorbent for 
effective treatment of pharmaceutical-contaminated wastewaters.

 1. Introduction 
A significant amount of pharmaceuticals goes 
unused, and these wastes end up in the 
environment through different ways and also, 
pharmaceuticals can enter the environment 
through excretion from our bodies. The 
presence of pharmaceuticals in the 
environment depends on their individual 
chemical structure and the amount of their 
use. In this regard, cephalexin (CFX) 
antibiotic due to the prevalence of use in the 
human and veterinary medicine was selected 
as an adsorbate in this study. Different 
wastewater treatment systems are considered 
to remove pharmaceuticals from water and 
wastewater (1-3). Among them, the most 
commonly and efficiently used method is 
adsorption. Adsorption of pharmaceuticals 
from wastewater has been developed by 
different researchers. Different adsorption 
capacities for CFX on various activated 
carbon (AC) were obtained by researchers (4). 
The adsorption capacities for some 
pharmaceuticals such as aspirin, caffeine, and 
acetaminophen onto graphene nanoplatelets 
were studied (5). Carbon nanotubes have 
shown great potential as effective adsorbents 
for hydrophobic organic contaminants such as 
tetracycline in water treatment in Ji et al. 
studies (6). According to other researchers, 
the NH 4Cl-AC in fixed-bed adsorption and 
subsequent ozonation presents a promising 
and efficient process for the removal of 
amoxicillin as an emerging contaminant from 
polluted water (7). 
The cost of adsorbent in the adsorption 
process is the most important factor. So, 
nowadays, researchers have been focused on 
the production of adsorbent from agriculture 
wastes as low-cost materials. Researchers 
have shown that tartaric acid modified rice 
husk is a highly efficient adsorbent for Ni 
and Cd from aqueous solution (8). The ACs 
produced from olive bagasse had the 
Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface 
areas ranging from 523 to 1106 m 2/g (9). Based on data obtained in other studies, it 
can be concluded that adsorption by modified 
rice stem is an efficient and reliable 
adsorbent for acid orange 7 dyes removal 
from liquid solutions (10). Scholars 
demonstrated that the activated red mud and 
Sargassum Glaucescens Biomass had a 
satisfactory quality in dye adsorption. They 
can be used as effective and inexpensive 
adsorbents for the treatment of textile 
effluent (11,12). Other scholars have also 
indicated that Azolla is an effective adsorbent 
for removing 2-chlorophenol and 4-
chlorophenol from water and wastewater 
(13). In this work, the walnut shell is applied 
to the production of AC as an adsorbent for 
the removal of CFX from aqueous solution. 
Nanofluids are a new class of fluids with 
dispersed nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm 
in diameter, in which the nanoparticles are 
permanently suspended in the base fluid (14).  
The effects of nanoparticles on the heat 
thermal conductivity and the mass transfer in 
the liquid phase have been investigated in 
several works. Researchers have observed that 
dye diffuses faster in nanofluids compared to 
that in water, with a peak enhancement at a 
nanoparticle volume fraction, φ, of 0.5% (15). 
The experimental results based on other work 
demonstrated that these nanofluids, containing 
a small amount of nanoparticles, have 
substantially higher thermal conductivities 
than the same liquids without nanoparticles 
(16). Furthermore, researchers have shown 
through an order-of-magnitude analysis that 
the enhancement in the effective thermal 
conductivity of nanofluids is due mainly to the 
localized convection caused by the Brownian 
movement of the nanoparticles (17). 
In this study, prepared adsorbent applied to 
the removal of CFX from aqueous solution in 
different CFX initial concentrations. Then, the 
effect of the presence of nanoparticles on the 
adsorption performance of walnut shell AC 
for the removal of CFX in an aqueous solution 
was investigated.

 2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Materials 
The CFX (C 16 H17 N3O4S) as an adsorbate was 
obtained from LOGHMAN Pharmaceutical 
and Hygienic Co., Tehran, Iran. Its purity was 
99.8% and λmax =263 nm. The molecular 
structure of CFX and its ionic forms as a 
function of pH is shown in figure 1. Zinc 
chloride (ZnCl 2) used in this study was 
supplied by Merck Company. Fe 2O3 and SiO 2 
nanoparticles with a BET surface area of 60 
and 200 m 2.g −1 and an average primary 
particle size of 40 and 12 nm, respectively, 
were supplied by the Degussa Company. 
 
2.2. Preparation of adsorbent 
The AC was prepared from chemical 
activation of walnut shell in the presence of 
ZnCl 2. The method of activation was based on 
Yang and Qiu work (18). It was repeatedly 
washed with distilled water to remove all 
traces of dust and dried in an oven at around 
110° C and then kept in airtight containers. 
The particle size of the samples was in the 
range of 251-354 nm. The adsorbent produced 
in the laboratory of adsorption, Babol 
University, Babol, Iran.  
 
2.3. Experiments 
First, the optimum adsorbent dose in this work 
obtained using different adsorbent dosage 
(0.005-0.04 g/50 ml CFX solution) at an initial concentration of 100 mg/L as 0.03 g. 
For determination of CFX removal efficiency 
(RE), 50 ml CFX solution at 100, 125, 150, 
175, and 200 mg/L initial concentration was 
agitated with 0.03 g of adsorbent for 20 h. 
Then, the samples were placed in a centrifuge 
for 30 min at 4000 rpm. Finally, the samples 
were analyzed using a ultraviolet-visible 
spectrophotometer (UNICAM, 8700 series, 
USA).To prepare the nanofluids of Fe 2O3 and 
SiO 2 of 20 ppm, proper amounts of Fe 2O3 and 
SiO 2 nanoparticles were dispersed in distilled 
water by ultrasonication for about 1 h 
(Misonix sonicator 3000). The influent CFX 
solution was prepared by adding the proper 
amount of CFX to the nanofluids. The 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
micrograph of the Fe 2O3 and SiO 2 
nanoparticles are shown in figure 2. It can be 
seen from figure 1 that Fe 2O3and SiO 2 
nanoparticles are spherical in physical nature. 
In addition, the dynamic light scattering is 
shown in figure 3. The mean diameter was 
found to be 62 and 56 mm for Fe 2O3 and SiO 2 
nanoparticles. The RE and maximum 
adsorption capacity (q e) of CFX adsorbed on 
walnut shell AC can be calculated as below:

3. Results  
3.1. Characteristic of adsorbents 
Prepared walnut shell AC had a specific 
surface area of 1452.1 m 2.g −1, total pore 
volume of 0.715 cm 3.g −1 (dry basis), a porosity 
of 58% and an apparent density of 0.823 
g.cm −3. The SEM of prepared AC before and 
after adsorption indicated in figure 4. As it can 
from figure 4, the pores of the adsorbent after 
adsorption, filled with CFX molecules. The 
zero surface charge characteristics of the walnut shell AC were determined using the 
method described by Reddy et al. (19). As 
demonstrated in figure 5, pH pzc  for the walnut 
shell AC was obtained at 6.67. 
 
3.2. The maximum adsorption capacity and 
the RE of CFX 
The maximum adsorption capacity and RE of 
CFX via walnut shell, AC at 100, 125, 150, 175, 
and 200 mg/L CFX concentration, was prepared 
and shown in figures 6 and 7, respectively. The 
maximum adsorption capacity was obtained 
243.1 mg/g and compare to other adsorbents in 
the adsorption of CFX and shown in table 1. On 
the basis of the experimental results, walnut 
shell AC was a great sorbent for the removal 
of CFX from aqueous solutions. The

 maximum RE was obtained 98.4 at 100 mg/L 
initial CFX concentration. The RE fell down 
by about 72.9% with increasing at an initial 
CFX concentration to 200 mg/L. Figure 8 
shows the effect of Fe 2O3 and SiO 2 
nanoparticles on the CFX adsorption process 
at 200 ppm CFX concentration and 303 K. It 
was found that the presence of nanoparticles 
in the optimum increased the RE of CFX by 
about 2.1% and 6.5% for Fe 2O3 and SiO 2 
nanoparticles, respectively.

4. Discussion 
As shown in figure 5, pH pzc  for the walnut 
shell AC was obtained at 6.67. In this regard, 
the walnut shell AC at pH values lower and 
higher than 6.67 demonstrates cationic and

 anionic behavior, respectively. The pH pzc can 
be used to determine the quality of the 
relation between pH and CFX adsorption 
value. The maximum adsorption capacity 
occurs when the surface charge of the walnut 
shell AC (adsorbent) is in contrast to the 
surface charge of the CFX (adsorbate). As 
indicated in figure 7, the RE decreased with a 
rise of initial CFX concentration. This trend 
can be due to remaining unsaturated sites 
during the adsorption process in the higher 
initial CFX concentration (24). According to 
figure 8, increased the RE of CFX by about 
2.1% and 6.5% for Fe 2O3 and SiO 2 
nanoparticles, respectively. The reason for 
this trend can be attributed to increasing the 
mass transfer. This can be due to decreasing 
in the effective layer thickness caused by 
particle rotation in these layers (25). 
Furthermore, Brownian motion can be an 
effective mechanism in the rise of adsorption 
value. The formation of micro and nano-scale 
convection motion caused by the Brownian 
motion of the nanoparticles and therefore, the 
RE of the CFX ions increases (26,27). 
However, decreasing in the RE after peaks at 
5 and 15 ppm nanoparticles concentration 
could be argued that the adsorbent surface 
would increase with the rise of the 
nanoparticles in the cavity, while, with a 
further increase in the concentration of 
nanoparticles in the adsorbent surface, holes 
filled and the adsorbent surface reduces. The 
competition between CFX molecules and 
nanoparticles to sit on the surface can be 
another reason for this trend. The cause of 
the occurrence of the peaks at 5 and 15 ppm 
for Fe 2O3 and SiO 2 nanoparticles, 
respectively, can be attributed the larger 
sized and lower specific surface area for 
Fe 2O3 nanoparticle in the comparison with 
the SiO 2 nanoparticle.
