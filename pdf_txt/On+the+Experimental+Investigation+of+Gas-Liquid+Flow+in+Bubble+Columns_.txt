Abstract
Many correlations have been developed to predict the hydrodynamics of bubble columns.
Often, these studies are performed for incomparable systems in terms of column and sparger
dimensions as well as physical uid properties. In this work, a dierent approach is proposed
comprising interrelated correlations for liquid velocity, gas holdup and bubble size. The corre-
lations are developed on the basis of complementary experiments with non-invasive measure-
ment techniques, namely, Ultrafast X-ray Computed Tomography (UXCT) and Radioactive
Particle Tracking (RPT). The experimental setup consists of a bubble column equipped with
a needle sparger. Developed correlations considers sparger dimensions, operating conditions
and bubble size. The bubble size is applied as the characteristic length in the Reynolds and
the E otv os numbers, which are utilized for the gas holdup and liquid velocity correlations.
In comparison with previous approaches, the developed correlations show better agreement
with experimental data from this study as well as from the literature.

1. Introduction
A bubble column reactor is a widely applied equipment in the chemical industry due to its
superior gas-liquid contacting ability, excellent mass and heat transfer performance, intensive
mixing without moving parts and comparably low energy consumption (Dudukovic and Mills,
1984, Deen et al., 2010). The excellent mixing characteristics prevent the formation of tem- 5
perature hotspots and thus, ensures high thermal stability. Despite the simple column design,
the multiphase ow within is complex and the process design requires detailed knowledge on
the key hydrodynamic properties, such as gas holdup, bubble size, liquid velocity and liquid
circulation velocity (Shimada et al., 2012). For instance, the mass transfer rate of a chemical
component into the liquid phase varies with the degree of liquid mixing due to the dependency 10
of the mass transfer coecient on bubble size, gas holdup, liquid velocity distribution and
liquid circulation velocity (Levenspiel, 1999). Particularly, the coecients of heat and mass
transfer correlations rely strongly on the gas holdup (Letzel et al., 1999, Akita and Yoshida,
1973, G otz et al., 2017). The spatial variation of the gas holdup is intimately related to the
Preprint submitted to Chemical Engineering Science July 20, 2019pressure gradients in the column cross-section, which in turn results in liquid circulation in the 15
bubble column and aect liquid mixing as well as heat and mass transfer (Letzel et al., 1999,
Kantarci et al., 2005). The specic gas-liquid interfacial area is an important design factor,
which directly correlates with the gas holdup and inversely with the bubble size. To enhance
the interfacial area for the gas-liquid mass transfer, small bubbles are desired (Polli et al.,
2002). As a consequence, smaller bubbles lead to higher gas residence time and higher gas 20
holdups (Letzel et al., 1999, Kantarci et al., 2005). In contrast, large bubbles experience large
net forces resulting from buoyancy and drag, which cause higher rise velocities. However, the
existence of large bubbles with high rising velocities causes increasing of liquid mixing, which
is desired for the increasing of heat transfer to immersed surfaces in the industrial bubble
columns. Another implication of the radial gas holdup distribution is the radial variation of 25
the liquid velocity. The liquid velocity distribution is important due to its particular eects on
the convective heat and mass transfer (Gandhi et al., 2009). Increasing the liquid circulation
velocity increases the liquid mixing in the bubble column, which causes a reduction of local
concentration gradients due to a higher mass transfer rate.
30
All these aforementioned parameters in bubble columns depend signicantly on operating
conditions, liquid properties, column dimensions, gas distributor design, etc. (Letzel et al.,
1999, Kantarci et al., 2005). Subsequently, numerous correlations for bubble size, gas holdup,
and liquid velocity have been proposed. These correlations are either developed on the basis
of experiments from particular setups or dierent operating conditions. Although it is known 35
that bubble size, gas holdup, liquid velocity and mixing are not independent from each other
(Schafer et al., 2002, Basha et al., 2015, S al et al., 2013), a complete experimental database to
derive the correlations for bubble size, gas holdup, and liquid velocity for identical bubble col-
umn geometry and operating conditions are, as far as the authors recalled, not yet compiled.
In this work, such a database is assembled on the basis of complementary experimental data 40
using Ultrafast X-ray Computed Tomography (UXCT) and Radioactive Particle Tracking
(RPT) for the derivation of hydrodynamic correlations. Contrary to literature correlations,
not only is this a unique concept, but also the developed correlations are \coupled" beside
dependency on physical properties, column dimensions and operating conditions. Starting
from the derivation of the inlet bubble size correlation, the mean bubble size correlation is 45
derived. Subsequently, the mean bubble size is applied as the characteristic length for the
dimensionless Reynolds and E otv os numbers, which are utilized in the derivation of the gas
holdup and liquid velocity correlations. As such, the coupling is described as \one-way".
In the following sections, literature correlations are revisited and the procedure of deriving 50
the hydrodynamic correlations is described. The employed state-of-the art measurement
techniques are presented for assembling a complementary experimental database. And nally,
the derived set of coupled correlations is given and its performance is compared with both
correlations and experimental data from literature.
2. Hydrodynamic correlations 55
Below, literature correlations are briey listed for bubble size, gas holdup and liquid
velocity. Afterwards, the procedure for deriving hydrodynamic correlations is explained with
using complementary experimental data.
22.1. Bubble size
Table 1 shows correlations for the prediction of the initial bubble diameter, di(bubble di- 60
ameter at sparger), which is mostly described in terms of sparger orice diameter, do(Leibson
et al., 1956, Miller, 1974, Bhavaraju et al., 1978, Moo-Young and Blanch, 1981) and orice
supercial gas velocity, Ugo(Leibson et al., 1956, Bhavaraju et al., 1978, Moo-Young and
Blanch, 1981). Amongst these studies, only Bhavaraju et al. (1978) considered properties of
the liquid phase instead of the gas phase. Beside these empirical correlations, Geary and Rice 65
(1991) developed a model based on the force balance to predict the initial bubble diameter
for rigid and exible spargers.

The inlet bubble does not retain its initial bubble size due to breakup and coalescence
events that changes the bubble size along its rising path. Considering the variety of breakup
and coalescence models (Liao and Lucas, 2009, 2010), uncertainties of model coecients 70
and the complexity of the population balance equations, simplied empirical correlations are
needed for the assessment of the bubble diameter. Table 2 shows correlations for the prediction
of the mean bubble diameter, dmin bubble columns. Krishna et al. (1991) and Krishna and

Ellenberger (1996) described dmper class of their two-bubble class model for the churn-
turbulent ow, i.e. large and small bubble classes. In the two-bubble class model, Krishna 75
and Ellenberger (1996) proposed a correlation for the large bubble diameter, dmL, which
depends on the gas holdup at ow regime transition. However, they did not consider a
correlation for the diameter of the small bubbles, dmS. Others simply just use the mean
bubble diameter of the whole bubbly ow. The correlations predicting bubble sizes show an
increase with increasing of supercial gas velocity (Akita and Yoshida, 1973, Basha et al., 80
42015, Kantarci et al., 2005), surface tension and viscosity (Kantarci et al., 2005, Akita and
Yoshida, 1973). Contrary, elevated pressure and increasing gas density reduce the mean
bubble size (Wilkinson et al., 1994). The eect of temperature is ambiguous and depends
on the non-linear change of vapor pressure, liquid viscosity and surface tension (Wilkinson
et al., 1994). However, the inconsistent predictions of the bubble size can be attributed to the 85
respective database gathered for dierent physical properties, operating conditions, column
dimensions and sparger designs. For the latter one, only Jamialahmadi and M uller-Steinhagen
(1992) and Kumar et al. (1976) related the mean bubble size to the initial bubble diameter.
It should be noted that any radial distribution of the bubble size, dm(), has been not yet
reported since such data are hardly accessible with conventional techniques. However, dm() 90
can be determined with ultrafast X-ray tomography as recently shown by Azizi et al. (2017).
2.2. Gas holdup
The eect of the supercial gas velocity on the gas holdup is commonly expressed as
g/Un
gwith 0:7< n < 1:2 for the homogeneous and 0 :4< n < 0:7 for the heterogeneous
ow regime (Basha et al., 2015, Shah et al., 1982, Reilly et al., 1986). In the heterogeneous 95
ow regime, the contribution of small bubbles to the gas holdup is rather constant and equals
the holdup at transition regime, whereas the large bubbles holdup continuously increases
with increasing Ug(Kantarci et al., 2005, Krishna et al., 1991). In Table 3, the most common
correlations for the prediction of the average gas holdup are summarized. All correlations
to a greater or lesser extent consider the eects of liquid physical properties on the gas 100
holdup. An increase in liquid viscosity reduces the gas holdup due to the formation of larger
bubbles with higher rise velocity (Akita and Yoshida, 1973). Decreasing the surface tension
results in smaller and more stable bubbles, which eventually lead to higher gas holdup and
more uniform distribution of radial gas holdup (Kumar et al., 1976). Elevated gas density
or higher operating pressure increase the gas holdup, which correlates inversely with the 105
bubble size as mentioned above (Kantarci et al., 2005, Basha et al., 2015, Wilkinson and
v. Dierendonck, 1990). The operating temperature mainly eects the liquid properties, which
in turn inuence the gas holdup (Basha et al., 2015). The available gas holdup correlations
show some inconsistencies with regard to supercial gas velocity and physical properties.
Kumar et al. (1976) and Reilly et al. (1986) considered gas and liquid phase densities and 110
surface tension, while Hughmark (1967) considered the densities only. Kawase et al. (1992)
and Hikita et al. (1980) considered liquid viscosity and density in their gas holdup correlations.
The column diameter is considered by Akita and Yoshida (1973), Behkish et al. (2006), S al
et al. (2013), Krishna and Ellenberger (1996) and Nedeltchev and Schumpe (2008). The eect
of the sparger design was emphasized in several studies (Luo et al., 1999, Akita and Yoshida, 115
1973). In particular, the introduction of small bubbles results in high gas holdups (Kantarci
et al., 2005). The sparger design, however, is ignored in the correlations. Only Behkish et al.
(2006) and S al et al. (2013) considered the orice size as a decisive parameter. By dividing
the gas holdup into contributions of large and small bubbles, Krishna and Ellenberger (1996)
developed a gas holdup correlation for the churn-turbulent regime, called the two-bubble class 120
model. The shape of the bubbles was also considered in the development of the gas holdup
correlations, e.g. Nedeltchev and Schumpe (2008) proposed a correlation assuming ellipsoidal
bubbles.

In addition to the mean gas holdup correlations, the radial distribution of the gas holdup 125
was also investigated in few studies (Walter and Blanch, 1983, Wu et al., 2001). A parabolic
gas holdup distribution is known to evolve in the column cross-section accompanied by radial
pressure gradients, which prompts liquid circulation pattern with rising liquid in the center
and descending liquid near the wall. Apart from some experimental studies (Kumar et al.,
71997, Wu et al., 2008, Azizi et al., 2017), only few correlations for the radial gas holdup 130
distribution, g(), have been proposed as summarized in Table 4. These correlations are
basically developed in terms of the dimensionless radius following a power law, where n
denes the steepness of the holdup distribution. Ueyama and Miyauchi (1979) considered
n2 for their experimental data and ~ gas the radial chordal average gas holdup. Wu et al.
(2001) included an additional parameter c, which determines the gas holdup value near the 135
wall.

2.3. Liquid velocity
The degree of liquid mixing is determined by the mean liquid circulation velocity, Ul;circ,
which strongly eects conversion and selectivity of chemical reactions in bubble columns
(Shimada et al., 2012). Ul;circis equal to the average ascending and descending liquid ve- 140
locity of the mean liquid velocity distribution, Ul(). Due to limited information on Ul(),
Ul;circis commonly estimated as proportional to ( DUg)m(Nottenk amper et al., 1983, Zehner,
1982, Degaleesan, 1997). In Table 5, correlations for Ul() are given. These correlations are
based on the centerline maximum velocity, Ul;max, whose correlations are also provided in this
table. ForUl(), Walter and Blanch (1983) proposed a second order polynomial correlation 145
considering the ow inversion point, which has been assigned to inv= 0:7. In their power
law correlation, they applied the same coecients for nandcas proposed for their gas holdup
correlation.
2.4. Correlation derivation from complementary experimental data 150
The correlations compiled in Tables 1 to 5 allow initial estimations of the hydrodynamic
parameters in bubble columns. These correlations are useful when only limited experimental
data are available. However, it should be noted that the application ranges of the correlations
in terms of ow regimes, physical properties, dimensions of bubble column and sparger design

are not explicitly mentioned for most of the correlations or are not consistent with each other. 155
In the engineering and design concepts, usually a combination of correlations of the following
hydrodynamic parameters, di,dm,dm(),g,g(),Ul(),Ul;circ, respectively, are applied in
the calculations. Dudley (1995) showed that dmandgare needed from other correlations
(Tables 2 and 4) to correlate the mass transfer. The interdependencies between dmandg
correlations are unknown due to the incomparable experiments and procedures for the devel- 160
opment of these correlations. Applying these correlations may result into strong deviations
from the actual values. Thus, to improve the results, compatible correlations containing the
interdependencies of hydrodynamic properties are needed. This can be achieved using an
experiment, which all hydrodynamic properties are measured for the derivation of a set of
"coupled" hydrodynamic correlations. 165
In our recent work, the potential of non-invasive measurement techniques, namely Ultra-
fast X-ray Computed Tomography (UXCT) and Radioactive Particle Tracking (RPT), has
been exemplarily illustrated for an advanced hydrodynamic analysis of bubble columns (Azizi
et al., 2017). These complementary techniques enable access to the dynamics of both uid 170
phases. The data sets of these measurement techniques provide a unique basis for the devel-
opment of hydrodynamic correlations. Hence, the detailed objective of this work is to derive
hydrodynamic correlations for di,dm,dm(),g,g(),Ul() andUl;circon the basis of experi-
mental data from UXCT and RPT. These techniques are applied to measure gas and liquid hy-
drodynamic properties at same operating conditions, column dimensions and sparger congu- 175
rations.

Steps 4, 5 and 6 are interchangeable, but are ordered here in a logical manner. 190
3. Experimental setup
The advanced measurement techniques UXCT and RPT were applied to a lab-scale bub-
ble column. The experiments were performed at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD,
India) and at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR, Germany) using RPT and
UXCT, respectively. In order to ensure identical experimental conditions at either end, 195
sparger and peripheral equipment were shipped to the respective labs and properties of the
liquid phase were precisely matched.
3.1. Bubble column geometry and operating conditions
A cylindrical bubble column with an inner diameter of D= 0:1 m and a height of
H= 1:0 m was used. Deionized water and air were used as liquid and gas phases, respectively, 200
and the following liquid phase properties were determined: = 7010 3N/m,l= 997
kg/m3,l= 0:001 kgm/s. The unaerated liquid height was adjusted at H0= 0:70 m. The
bottom of the column was equipped with a needle sparger, which consists of three radially
10separated gas plenum sections with a height of Hp= 0:20 m. Dierent numbers of needles
with various sizes can be installed via 115 connection points similar to Luer-Lock connections. 205
The Luer luck connection bases of needles are implemented inside the sparger. The full metal
section of needles is in contact with liquid. The inserted length of needles is 30 mm for all of
the needles in dierent sparger congurations. In Table 6, the applied sparger congurations
A to F are shown with corresponding specications. The radially separated plenum sections
are indicated with dotted red line. 210

2608A, 1xFMA-2609A) at Ug= 1:0, 3:2, 5:3 and 9:5 cm/s, respectively, while each gas plenum
section of the sparger was separately connected to a mass ow controller. The gas ow rate
through every section was adjusted according to the respective number of installed needles.
Needles of 30 mm length with dierent inner diameters were installed. Table 7 summarizes 215
the experimental matrix with the corresponding sparger congurations. The experimental
matrix was chosen to cover both the homogeneous and heterogeneous ow regime via various
supercial gas velocities while the inlet bubble size has been controlled by needle size and
number installed in sparger.
3.2. Ultrafast X-ray Computed Tomography (UXCT) 220
Figure 2 shows the bubble column with the installed UXCT setup. Basically, UXCT
produces cross-sectional images of the transient two-phase ows (reconstructed images with
240 pixels per 120 mm) at a scanning rate of 1000 frames per second (fps). An electron
beam is focused on a tungsten target generating an X-ray spot. The electron beam is swept
periodically along the target surrounding the bubble column so that the produced X-ray fan 225
penetrates the column from dierent angles. The arriving X-ray intensity is recorded with a
detector ring, which consists of multiple detector elements co-aligned with the target. Each
revolution of the electron beam around the bubble column provides X-ray intensity data for
the reconstruction of one cross-sectional image at time step t(Fischer and Hampel, 2010,
Bieberle et al., 2011). For the individual post-processing steps and the accuracy analysis 230
of UXCT measurements, the reader is referred to Azizi et al. (2017). The experiments to
determine bubble size and gas holdup were conducted at heights of Hmeas= 0:01;0:1;0:3 and
0:5 m above the needles head of sparger. At each height, the mean values as well as the radial
proles of bubble size and gas holdup were calculated via averaging over the whole cross-
section and circumferentially, respectively. According to Fischer et al. (2008), a frame rates 235

of at least 1000 fps are required to produce sharp phase distribution images with a spatial
resolution of about 1 mm. In this work, the minimum detected bubble diameter is 1 mm.
The experimental data at Hmeas= 0:01 m are used to determine the initial bubble size at the
sparger, due to capability of releasing the bubbles without breakup and coalescence at the top
of the needles.The applied dynamic high-speed imaging in UXCT experiments is not prone 240
to typical dynamic bias errors known from time-averaging probe measurement techniques
(Fischer et al., 2008). The measurement time for each experiment was 10 s. Considering the
hardware limitation and the costs of measurements, the longer measurement times were not
possible. However, the identied bubbles are around few thousand in UXCT measurements,
which provides statistically reliable data in 10 s. 245
3.3. Radioactive Particle Tracking (RPT)
Figure 3 shows the bubble column with the RPT setup using eight detectors located
at four dierent axial heights. In the RPT experiments, the tracer particle is a radioactive
isotope (Sc46) with a half-time of 83 days, which decays by beta emission followed by gamma-
ray emission. The radioactive particle is encapsulated in a sphere of polymeric material with 250
2 mm diameter. The whole tracer particle has an equivalent density similar to the liquid phase
to ensure that it is neutrally buoyant and follows the liquid ow precisely (Azizi et al., 2017).
Stokes number, Stcharacterizes the motion of particles in a continuous uid. In fact, St< 1
is essential to guarantee following of the tracer particle closely to the liquid streamlines. In
this work, the corresponding Stokes numbers of experiments are 0 :04< St < 0:15. During 255
the RPT measurements, the moving tracer particle continuously emits gamma photons. The
bubble column is surrounded by an optimized arrangement of scintillation detectors (Roy
et al., 2002). The incident photons hit the NaI crystals in the detectors and scintillate
into visible light. The visible light passes through the photomultiplier and gets converted
into electrical pulses. The RPT measurement frequency is 50 Hz. The counted pulses of 260
the detectors for each time step decrease exponentially with increasing distance between

scintillation detector and tracer. Prior to the measurements, calibration data were recorded
at multiple known positions of the tracer particle. At every individual measurement time step,
the comparison of the photon counts of the detectors between measurement and calibration
data discloses the position of the tracer particle (Upadhyay et al., 2013). Eventually, the 265
velocimetry data for the liquid phase can be obtained from RPT measurements based on
known tracer positions at each time step of the measurement (Degaleesan et al., 2001). The
measurement time for each experiment was approximately 20 hours to collect sucient data
for the reconstruction of the velocity eld.
4. Results and discussion 270
4.1. Complementary experimental database
In this section, an overview of the gas phase ow morphology and the particle trajectories is
provided, which is obtained via UXCT and RPT, respectively. Figure 4a illustrates the eect
of the sparger conguration on the liquid dispersion (particle trajectories) and gas structure
(vertical coordinate represents the measurement time) via 3D stacked sequences of 1000 UXCT 275
images obtained at Hmeas= 50 cm during one second measurement time. The sparger cong-
uration F consists of a large number of small needles, which accordingly produce small bubbles
uniformly dispersed in the whole cross-section of the bubble column. With bigger needle size
and lower number of installed needles (sparger structures B and A), the size of the bubbles
increases and larger bubbles accumulate in the center region of the column cross-section. Bub- 280

subsequent locations. The length and the dynamics of the trajectory (tracer particle path 285
lines) indicate the liquid displacement, which is comparably low in the bubble column with the
sparger structure F. This is due to small and uniform bubbles distributed evenly in the cross-
section. Accordingly, the liquid mixing within the bubble column is low. The gas dynamics is
increased due to larger bubbles released from the coarser sparger congurations B and A. As
a consequence, the drag force increases causing higher liquid velocities in the bubble column. 290
The eect of the supercial gas velocity on the gas phase structure is shown in Figure 5a
atHmeas = 50 cm for the sparger structure F, which releases small bubbles of narrow size
distribution. Gas holdup and bubble size increase with increasing supercial gas velocity
from 1:0 to 9:5 cm/s, accompanied by a decreasing uniformity of the gas holdup distribution. 295
In Figure 5b the corresponding particle trajectories from 6000 subsequent particle locations
(i.e. 120 seconds) show increasing displacement and dynamics at higher supercial gas veloc-
ities. The tracer trajectory at Ug= 1:0 cm/s consists mainly of longer rising and descending
paths, while at larger supercial gas velocity, the tracer moves in a more random manner.
Gas bubble dispersions and particle trajectories at Ug= 1:0 cm/s belong to the homoge- 300
neous regime, while the increased uctuations, the spiraling path of the bubbles as well as
the intensied displacement of the tracer particle indicate transition ( Ug= 3:2;5:3 cm/s) and
heterogeneous regimes ( Ug= 9:5 cm/s).
In the following sections, the correlations for mean bubble size, gas holdup and liquid ve- 305
locity are derived from UXCT and RPT experiments and compared with existing correlations.
Experimental data from the literature, which are not used in developing of new correlations,
were also applied to validate the developed correlations. The domain of denition of devel-

oped correlations are given in form of dimensionless numbers. Considering these domains,
limited experimental data exist for the evaluation of the correlations. Thus, the proposed 310
evaluation data consist of bubble columns with needle sparger and perforated plate. In the
developed correlations, the sparger eect were considered in form of sparger conguration and
initial bubbles diameter. The evaluation of developed correlations shows a fair agreement of
experimental data at the low supercial gas velocities in the bubble columns with perforated
plate sparger. To derive each of the radial distribution correlations for bubble size, gas holdup 315
and liquid velocity, an optimization problem was solved to minimize the error of predicted
radial property compared with the experimental data.
4.2. Bubble size correlations
Since the sparger generally eects the mean bubble size and liquid motion, the initial
bubble size is correlated with the internal needle diameter considering also the operating con- 320
ditions. Subsequently, the initial bubble size is applied as a characteristic length to correlate
the mean bubble size in the column.
4.2.1. Initial bubble size at the sparger
The eective forces on determining bubble formation, expansion and detachment are in-
ertia, viscous, buoyancy and surface tension forces (where g<<l) (Geary and Rice, 1991, 325

Equation 3 provides less than 20 % deviation, while the predictions of the correlations sum-
marized in Table 2 are scattered in a wider range. Amongst the literature correlations, the 335
model based on a force balance proposed by Geary and Rice (1991) shows the least deviations
due to considering similar forces used to derive Equation 3.

4.2.2. Mean bubble size
Previous correlations for the mean bubble size consider only the Reynolds number (see
Table 2). However, the UXCT data reveal that the sparger congurations are decisive for the 340
mean bubble size. Thus, the new correlation

is proposed, which is valid for 0 :1<D=Np<0:29 and 20<Redi<3200. As shown in the
parity plot in Figure 7, the predictions from the previous correlations (see Table 2) deviate
strongly from UXCT experiments. Increasing Rediindicates increasing turbulence at the 345
sparger region. The magnitude of dmdepends on the net eect of turbulence-induced breakup
and coalescence (Liao and Lucas, 2009, 2010). However, Rediincreases with increasing di,
which indicates an increase of the bubble-induced turbulence for the large bubbles. With
increasingRedithe mean bubble diameter increases by Re0:34
di. Furthermore, in Equation 4,
the mean bubble diameter increases with decreasing pitch size of the sparger and increasing 350
number of installed needles, resulting from an increasing coalescence rate.
4.2.3. Radial distribution of the mean bubble size
The radial bubble size distribution is correlated with a power law function, which can
indicate larger bubbles in the center and a gradual reduction of the bubble size towards the
wall (Kantarci et al., 2005, Basha et al., 2015) according to 355

where 56< Redm<2050 and 4 < E odm<66 are the valid ranges. Figure 8 presents
the UXCT experimental results for the radial bubble size distribution in comparison with
the predictions of Equation 6 for dierent supercial gas velocity. At lower gas velocity,
the radial bubble size distribution is rather at, while a parabolic behavior is obtained with 365
increasing supercial gas velocity. In Figure 8, applied sparger congurations and supercial
gas velocities are F,B,E and C and 1.0, 3.2, 5.3 and 9.5 cm/s, respectively. Although dierent
spargers and supercial gas velocities were applied, the developed correlation matches fairly
well the radial bubble size distribution for all conditions. To the best of our knowledge,
correlations for the radial bubble size distribution in bubble columns are not available in the 370
literature.

4.2.4. Comparison with experimental bubble size data from literature
Aiming for a bubble size correlation, which is valid beyond the own study, experimental
data (Jamialahmadi and M uller-Steinhagen, 1992) and correlations from literature were com-
pared with Equation 4 as shown in Figure 9. The experimental data of Jamialahmadi and 375
M uller-Steinhagen (1992) are obtained for a bubble column of 10.5 cm diameter with a plate
sparger with 1 mm orice diameter distributed in a 18 mm triangular pitch ( N= 35). The
correlations of Akita and Yoshida (1973), Wilkinson et al. (1994), Kumar et al. (1976) show
strong deviations. Equation 4 correctly accounts for the eect of the increasing supercial
gas velocity considering the geometric features of the sparger. The developed correlation only 380
slightly deviates from the experimental bubble size data, which might be due to the invasive
nature of the probe measurements.
4.3. Gas holdup correlations
A similar approach for the development of the gas holdup correlation is applied. The total
gas holdup correlation is developed based on RedmandEodmto account for the eect of dm 385
andUgo. Similar to the radial bubble size distribution, a power law correlation is used to t
the radial gas holdup prole.
4.3.1. Total gas holdup
Considering RedmandEodmas dened in Equations 10 and 11, the total gas holdup is
derived as 390

The parity plot in Figure 10 compares results of correlations and experimental data using
Equation 12 and the available total gas holdup correlations from the literature (see Table 3).
It should be mentioned that most of the available correlations ignore the sparger design and
thus, deviate strongly from the experimental results. Only the correlations of Behkish et al.

correlations. As mentioned in various studies, the total gas holdup increases with decreasing
bubble size (Deen et al., 2010). Equation 12 shows a good agreement between experimental 400
and predicted total gas holdup.

204.3.2. Radial gas holdup distribution
The developed correlation for the radial gas holdup distribution follows the approach
of Wu et al. (2001) except for the coecients, which are modied according to UXCT ex-
perimental results. The parameters of the correlation are correlated with RedmandEodm
(Equations 15,16). In the correlation, the gas holdup in the center reduces gradually towards 405
the column wall according to
g() =g;max (1 cn): (13)
The maximum gas holdup is dened as

Considering RedmandEodm(Equations 10 and 11), the coecients candnare chosen to 410
properly predict the radial gas holdup prole, where 0 :26<c<0:93 and 0:83<n<2:16
are the valid ranges. Figure 11 compares the UXCT measurement data with the predictions of
Equation 13 using the coecients of Wu et al. (2001) and the newly derived coecients. The
applied sparger congurations and supercial gas velocities in experiments and correlations are
F,B,E and C and 1.0, 3.2, 5.3 and 9.5 cm/s, respectively. As shown in Table 4, the correlation 415
of Wu et al. (2001) does not depend on the gas sparger and deviations increase with increasing
supercial gas velocity. The developed correlation matches the radial gas holdup distribution
fairly well. At low gas ow rate with small and uniform bubble size distribution, the radial
gas holdup prole is rather at, while the radial gas holdup distribution has a parabolic shape
at high gas ow rates. 420
4.3.3. Comparison with experimental gas holdup data from literature
Figure 12a shows the behavior of the total gas holdup for increasing supercial gas velocity
in a bubble column with an inner diameter of D= 0:14 m equipped with a perforated
plate sparger with N= 91 orices, whose diameter is do= 0:4 mm (S al et al., 2013). The
developed correlation shows fair agreements with the experimental gas holdup especially at the 425
lowerUg. In Figure 12b, experimental data and predictions are shown for a bubble column
with a needle sparger (Hooshyar et al., 2010). The diameter of the column is D= 0:15
m and the needle sparger consists of N= 559 needles with an inner diameter of do=
0:8 mm. The prediction with the new correlation ts the experimental data also well in
comparison to the other correlations. However, it should be mentioned that the range of 430
the dimensionless number presenting the sparger conguration does not match the suggested
limits in Figure 12b, which causes the deviation in mean bubble diameter and total gas
holdup. In both sub-gures of Figure 12, the linear increase and later nonlinear behavior
of the experimental gas holdup shows the transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous

more pronounced at the transition points of the experimental data. The measurement and
estimation of dmat higherUgis dicult. Applying of the developed correlation based on dm,
the bigger bubble size leads to lower gas holdups compared to the experiments. Due to the
overestimation of dm, the gas holdup deviates from experimental data at higher Ug.

The liquid velocity distributions were measured using the RPT technique. After recon-

at a height of approximately 20 cm above the sparger. To obtain the liquid circulation pattern
within the bubble column, the axial liquid velocity is averaged over a range from 20 to 50 cm 450
above the sparger to exclude sparger and free surface eects.
23The cross-sectional time averaged liquid velocity of the bubble column is zero, while the
time-averaged liquid ow involves upward and downward ows in the axial direction. In the
following sections, correlations are developed for the prediction of the radial distribution of 455
the axial velocity and the mean circulation velocity of the liquid phase.
Figure 14: Averaging window along the height of bubble column for the liquid velocity.
4.4.1. Radial distribution of the liquid velocity
The velocity distribution involves a maximum in the center of the bubble column, which
reduces gradually from the center to the inversion point. At the inversion point, the liquid
velocity reaches zero and then, the liquid ow direction changes to downward ow between the 460
inversion point and the wall. Theoretically, the liquid velocity follows the non-slip condition
at the wall. However, the thickness of the boundary layer is very small and the experimental
RPT data show the liquid velocity is not zero near to the wall. For this reason, a third order
polynomial equation is considered for the liquid velocity distribution that accounts for the
liquid ow behavior in the bubble column. However, the following boundary conditions are 465
required as a set of constraints to establish the uniqueness of the ow eld: maximum velocity
at the (@Ul=@= 0 andUl=Ul;max at= 0), zero velocity at the inversion point ( Ul= 0
at=inv) and partial slip velocity at the wall ( (@Ul=@) + (1 )Ul= 0 at= 1). The
parameteris the specularity coecient, which varies between zero (smooth wall) and one
24(rough wall). Here, = 0:25 is considered. Applying these conditions results in 470

Predicting the maximum liquid velocity with the available correlations in the literature
(see Table 5) is not possible, because the eect of the sparger structure on the liquid velocity
is neglected. In Figure 15, the assessment of the radial velocity distribution correlations is
shown in comparison with the RPT experiments. Here, the applied congurations of the 480
sparger and supercial gas velocities are F,B,E and C and 1.0, 3.2, 5.3 and 9.5 cm/s respec-
tively. This way, the radial distributions of bubble size (Figure 8), gas holdup (Figure 11)
and liquid velocity (Figure 15) can be compared at identical operating conditions. Contrary
to Wu and Al-Dahhan (2001), the inversion point of the experimental data is below 0.7.
The inversion point in the new developed correlation depends on Redm. Compared with the 485
new correlation, one of Wu and Al-Dahhan (2001) deviates from the experimental results in
predicting the radial liquid velocity.
4.4.2. Mean liquid circulation velocity
The mean liquid circulation velocity represents the degree of liquid mixing in the bubble
column. The following correlation is based on sparger conguration and Reynolds number 490
(dened in Equation 10) according to
Ul;circ= 0:79Ul;maxEo 0:09
dm: (23)
The mean liquid circulation velocity is the absolute average liquid velocity from the center
to the inversion point (or from the inversion point to the wall). Considering the radial
distributions of liquid velocity and gas holdup, the mean liquid velocity is derived as

and by the new correlation with the experimental data from RPT (this work).
The developed correlations for gas holdup and radial liquid distribution (Equations 13 and 17) 495
can be applied in Equation 24 for calculating Ul;circ. As discussed in the introduction section,
most researchers correlated Ul;circbased on (DUg)m(Nottenk amper et al., 1983, Zehner, 1982,
Degaleesan, 1997). Nottenk amper et al. (1983) applied m= 0:4 based on their experiments.
However, the prediction deviates from RPT experimental data at low Ugvalues (see Figure
16), while fair agreement is obtained for high Ugvalues. The developed correlation for the 500
mean liquid circulation velocity predicts the experiments correctly considering the inuence
of the sparger congurations.
4.4.3. Comparison with experimental liquid velocity data from literature
In Figure 17, the predictions using the proposed radial liquid distribution correlation are
compared with various experimental bubble column data from the literature. Degaleesan et al. 505

mm and a pitch size of 15 mm for a column diameter of D= 0:14 m. The prediction especially
near the wall is better to the correlation of Wu and Al-Dahhan (2001). The results of Wu and
Al-Dahhan (2001) are based on the velocity predicted by the correlation of Riquarts (1981),
which shows a better agreement than the correlation of Zehner (1982) for the centerline 510
velocity. The error of the developed correlation decreases with increasing supercial gas
velocity.
Figure 18 presents experimental data from Sommerfeld and Br oder (2009) for a bubble
column diameter of D= 0:14 m operated with a needle sparger consisting of 50 needles with 515
an inner diameter of 0.4 mm and a pitch size of 12 mm. The predicted velocity distribution for
the needle sparger fairly agrees with the experimental data. The centerline velocity obtained
from Wu and Al-Dahhan (2001) is estimated by applying the correlation of Riquarts (1981).
Again, applying the centerline velocity of Riquarts (1981) gives a better estimation than the
correlation of Zehner (1982) for the centerline velocity. 520

Hydrodynamic correlations are derived for bubble columns using complementary experi-
mental data of UXCT and RPT measurements. UXCT is employed for gas phase dynamics,
while RPT is used to obtain liquid phase dynamics. The measurements are performed for
a bubble column with identical geometrical dimensions and operating conditions as well as 525
sparger congurations. The correlations are derived using the Buckingham  theorem and
a complete set of coupled hydrodynamic correlations for fdi,dm,dm(),g,g(),Ul(),
Ul;circgis given in the Equations (3, 4, 6, 12, 13, 17 and 23). These correlations are \one-
way" coupled as illustrated in the derivation procedure. First, diis correlated and is in turn
employed to derive the correlation for dm. Subsequently, characteristic dimensionless num- 530
bers regarding the complex hydrodynamics ( Re,Eo) on basis of dmalong with the sparger
conguration D=(Np) are used to derive correlations of dm(),g(and corresponding
g()) andUl() (and corresponding Ul;circ). The validity range of the derived correlations
are 0:1<D= (Np)<0:29, 56<Redm<2050 and 4 <Eodm<66. Eventually, the general
predictability of the developed correlations is also conrmed with experimental data from the 535
literature obtained for dierent columns, sparger structures and operating conditions. As a
future work, additional experiments for presenting dependency of developed correlations on
physical properties are desired.

31Appendix A. Example of dimensional analysis and Buckingham  theorem 545
An example of dimensional analysis and Buckingham  theorem (Curtis et al., 1982) is
given to explain the development of the empirical correlations for the hydrodynamics in bubble
columns. Equation 3 is developed based on a correlation between the decisive parameters
according to
f(l;l;;g;Ug;di;do) = 0: (A.1)
The dimensions of the decisive parameters in terms of fundamental dimensions are summa- 550
rized in Table A1, which are length, mass, time and temperature.

The number of the parameters and the fundamental dimensions are 7 and 3, respectively.
The equation relating the considered parameters requires (7-3) dimensionless numbers. Buck-
ingham referred to these numbers as  numbers, which are independent from each other. The
correlation is obtained as 555
4=f(3;2;1): (A.2)
The dimensionless numbers can be considered as multiplication of mrepeating parameters
with an unknown exponent cand another parameter without exponent. According to the
Buckingham theorem, two conditions should be considered in deriving the dimensionless num-
bers: First, each of the fundamental dimensions must appear in at least one of the repeating
parameters. Second, the repeating parameter cannot be a dimensionless parameter. Here, 560
the parameters do,gandare chosen as the repeating parameters. Accordingly, the dimen-
sionless numbers are
