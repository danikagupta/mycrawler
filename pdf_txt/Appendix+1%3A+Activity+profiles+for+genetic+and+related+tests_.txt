ACTIVITY PROFILES FOR
GENETIC AND RELATED EFFECTSAPPENDIX 2
AeTIVTY PROFILES FOR
GENETIC AND RELATED EFFEeTS
Methods
The x-axis of the activity profile (Waters et aL., 1987, 1988) represents the bioassays in
phylogenetic sequence by endpoint, and the values on the y-axis represent the logarithmically
transformed lowest effective doses (LED) and highest ineffective doses (HID) tested. The
term 'dose', as used in this report, does not take into consideration length of treatment or
exposure and may therefore be considered synonymous with concentration. ln practice, the
concentrations used in ail the in-vitro tests were converted to J,g/ml, and those for in-vivo
tests were expressed as mg/kg bw. Because dose units are plotted on a log scale, differences
in molecular weights of compounds do not, in most cases, greatly influence comparisons of
their activity profiles. Conventions for dose conversions are given below.
Profile-line height (the magnitude of each bar) is a function of the LED or HID, which
is associated with the characteristics of each individual test system-such as population size,
cell-cycIe kinetics and metabolic competence. Thus, the detection IImit of each test system
is different, and, across a given activity profile, responses will vary substantially. No attempt
is made to adjust or relate responses in one test system to those of another.
Line heights are derIved as follows: for negative test results, the highest dose tested
without appreciable toxicity is defined as the HID. If there was evidence of extreme toxicity,
the next highest dose is used. A single dose tested with a negative result is considered to be
equivalent to the HID. Similarly, for positive results, the LED is recorded. If the original
data were analysed statistically by the author, the dose recorded is that at which the response
was significant (p .c 0.05). If the available data were not analysed statistically, the dose
required to produce an effect is estimated as follows: when a dose-related positive response
is observed with two or more doses, the lower of the doses is taken as the LED; a single dose
resulting in a positive response is considered to be equivalent to the LED.
ln order to accmmoda te both the wide range of doses encountered and positive and
negative responses on a continuous scale, doses are transformed logarithmically, so that
effective (LED) and ineffective (HID) doses are represented by positive and negative
-389-390 !AC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 58
numbers, respectively. The response, or logarithmic dose unit (LDUij), for a given test system
i and chemical j is represented by the expressions
LDUij = -loglO (dose), for HID values; LDU ..0and (1)
LDUij = -loglO (dose x 10-5), for LED values; LDU ~O.
These simple relationships define a dose range of 0 to -5 logarithmic units for ineffectivedoses (1-100 000 l1g/ml or mg/kg bw) and 0 to + 8 logarithmic units for effective doses
(100000-0.001 l1g/ml or mg/kg bw). A scale ilustrating the LDU values is shown in Figure
1. Negative responses at doses less than 1 l1g/ml (mg/kg bw) are set equal to 1. Effectively,
an LED value ~ 100 000 or an HID value ..1 produces an LDU = 0; no quantitative
information is gained from such extreme values. The dotted IInes at the levels of log dose
units 1 and -1 define a 'zone of uncertainty' in which positive results are reported at such
high doses (between 10000 and 100000 l1g/ml or mg/kg bw) or negative results are reported
at such low dose levels (1 to 10 l1g/ml or mg/kg bw) as to caU into question the adequacy
of the test.

Negative
(J.g/ml or mg/kg bw)
LED and HID are expressed as J.g/ml or mg/kg bw.
ln practice, an activity profile is computer generated. A data entry programme is used
to store abstracted data from published reports. A sequential file (in ASCII) is created for
each compound, and a record within that file consists of the na me and Chemical AbstractsServce number of the compound, a three-Ietter code for the test system (see below), the
qualitative test result (with and without an exogenous metabolic system), dose (LED or
HID), citation number and additional source information. An abbreviated citation for each
publication is stored in a segment of a record accssing both the test data file and the citationAPPENDIX 2391
file. During processing of the data file, an average of the logarithmic values of the data subset
is calculated, and the length of the profile line represents this average value. Ali dose values
are plotted for each profile line, regardless of whether results are positive or negative.
Results obtained in the absence of an exogenous metabolic system are indicated by a bar
(-), and results obtained in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system are indicated by
an upward-directed arrow (t). When ail results for a given assay are either positive or
negative, the me an of the LDU values is plotted as a solid line; when conflicting data are
reported for the same assay (Le., both positive and negative results), the majority data are
shown by a solid line and the minority data bya dashed line (drawn to the extreme conflicting
response). ln the few cases in which the numbers of positive and negative results are equal,
the solid line is drawn in the positive direction and the maximal negative response is indicated
with a dashed line.
Profile lines are identified by three-letter code words representing the commonly used
tests. Code words for most of the test systems in current use in genetic toxicology were
defined for the US Environmental Protection Agency's GENE-TOX Program (Waters, 1979;
Waters & Auletta, 1981). For lARe Monographs Supplement 6, Volume 44 and sub-
sequent volumes, including this publication, codes were redefined in a manner that should
facilitate inclusion of additional tests. Naming conventions are described below.
Data listings are presented in the text and include endpoint and test codes, a short test
code definition, results (either with (M) or without (NM) an exogenous activation system),
the associated LED or HID value and a short citation. Test codes are organized phylo-
genetically and by endpoint from left to right across each activity profile and from top to
bottom of the corresponding data listing. Endpoints are defined as follows: A, aneuploidy;
C, chromosomal aberrations; D, DNA damage; F, assays of body fluids; G, gene mutation;
H, host-mediated assays; 1, inhibition of intercellular communication; M, micronuclei;
P, sperm morphology; R, mitotic recombination or gene conversion; S, sister chromatid
exchange; and 1: cell transformation.
Dose conversions for activity profiles
Doses are converted to l1g/ml for in-vitro tests and to mg/kg bw per day for in-vivo
experiments.
1. ln-vitro test systems
(a) Weight/volume convert directly to l1g/mL.
(b) Molar (M) concentration x molecular weight = mg/ml = 103 l1g/ml; mM concen-
tration x molecular weight = l1g/mL.
(c) Soluble solids expressed as % concentration are assumed to be in units of mass per
volume (i.e., 1 % = 0.01 g/ml = 10 000 l1g/ml; also, 1 ppm = 1 l1g/ml).
(d) Liquids and gases expressed as % concentration are assumed to be given in units
of volume per volume. Liquids are converted to weight per volume using the density
(D) of the solution (D = g/ml). Gases are converted from volume to mass using
the ideal gas law, PV = nRT: For exposure at 20-37°C at standard atmospheric
pressure, 1 % (v/v) = 0.4 l1g/ml x molecular weight of the gas. AIso, 1 ppm (v/v)
= 4 x 10-5 l1g/ml x molecular weight.392 lAC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 58
(e) ln microbial plate tests, it is usual for the doses to be reported as weight/plate,
whereas concentrations are required to enter data on the activity profile chart.
While remaining cognisant of the errors involved in the process, it is assumed that
a 2-ml volume of top agar is delivered to each plate and that the test substance
remains in solution within it; concentrations are derived from the reported weight/-
plate values by dividing by this arbitrary volume. For spot tests, a I-ml volume is
used in the calculation.
(f Conversion ofparticulate concentrations given in l.g/cm2 are based on the area (A)
of the dish and the volume of medium per dish; i.e., for a 100-mm dish: A = 1TR2
= 1T x (5 cm)2 = 78.5 cm2. If the volume of medium is 10 ml, then 78.5 cm2 = 10
ml and 1 cm2 = 0.13 mL.
2. ln-vitro systems using in-vivo activation
For the body fluid-urine (BF-) test, the concentration used is the dose (in mg/kg bw)
of the compound administered to test animaIs or patients.
3. ln-vivo test systems
(a) Doses are converted to mg/kg bw per day of exposure, assuming 100% absorption.
Standard values are used for each sex and species of rodent, including body weight
and average intake per day, as reported by Gold et al. (1984). For example, in a test
using male mice fed 50 ppm of the agent in the diet, the standard food intake per
day is 12 % of body weight, and the conversion is dose = 50 ppm x 12 % = 6 mglkg
bw per day.
Standard values used for humans are: weight-males, 70 kg; females, 55 kg; surface
area, 1.7 m2; inhalation rate, 20 IImin for light work, 30 IImin for mild exercise.
(b) When reported, the dose at the target site is used. For example, doses given in
studies of lymphocyes of humans exposed in vivo are the measured blood
concentrations in l.g/ml.
Codes for test systems
For specific nonmammalian test systems, the first two letters of the three-symbol code
word define the test organism (e.g., SA- for Salmonella typhimurium, EC- for Escherichia
coli). If the species is not known, the convention used is -S-. The third symbol may be used
to define the tester strain (e.g., SA8 for S. typhimurium TA1538, ECW for E. coli WP2uvrA).
When strain designation is not indicated, the third letter is used to define the specifie genetic
endpoint under investigation (e.g., --D for differential toxicity, --F for forward mutation,
--G for gene conversion or genetic crossing-over, --N for aneuploidy, --R for reverse
mutation, --U for unscheduled DNA synthesis). The third letter may also be used to define
the general endpoint under investigation when a more complete definition is not possible
or relevant (e.g., --M for mutation, --C for chromosomal aberration).
For mammalian test systems, the first letter of the three-letter code word defines the
genetic endpoint under investigation: A-- for aneuploidy, B-- for binding, C-- for
chromosomal aberration, D-- for DNA strand breaks, G-- for gene mutation, 1-- for
inhibition of intercellular communication, M-- for micronucleus formation, R-- for DNAAPPENDIX 2 393
repair, S-- for sister chromatid exchange, T - for cell transformation and U- for
unscheduled DNA sythesis.
For animal (i.e., non-human) test systems in vitro, when the cell tye is not specified, the
code letters -lA are used. For su ch assys in vivo, when the animal species is not specified,
the code letters -VA are used. Commonly used animal species are identified by the third
letter (e.g., --C for Chinese hamster, --M for mouse, --R for rat, --S for Syrian hamster).
For test systems using human cells in vitro, when the cell tye is not specified, the code
letters -IH are used. For assays on hum ans in vivo, when the cell tye is not specified, thecode letters - VH are used. Otherwse, the second letter specifies the cell tye under
investigation (e.g., -BH for bone marrow, -LH for lymphocyes).
Sorne other specific coding conventions used for mammalian systems are as follows: BF-
for body fluids, HM- for host-mediated, --L for leukocyes or lymphocyes in vitro (-AL,
animaIs; -HL, humans), -L- for leukocyes in vivo (-LA animaIs; -LH, humans), --T for
transformed cells.
Note that these are examples of major conventions used to define the assay code words.
The alphabetized listing of codes must be examined to confirm a specifie code word. As
might be expected from the limitation to three sybols, sorne codes do not fit the naming
conventions precisely. ln a few cases, test systems are defined by first-letter code words, for
example: MS'l mouse spot test; SLp, mouse specifie locus test, postspermatogonia; SLO,
mouse specifie locus test, other stages; DLM, dominant lethal test in mice; DLR, dominant
lethal test in rats; MH'l mouse heritable translocation test.
The genetic activity profiles and listings were prepared in collaboration with Environ-
mental Health Research and Testing Inc. (EHRT) under contract to the US Environmental
Protection Agency; EHRT also determined the doses used. The references cited in each
genetic activity profile listing can be found in the list of references in the appropriate
monograph.
