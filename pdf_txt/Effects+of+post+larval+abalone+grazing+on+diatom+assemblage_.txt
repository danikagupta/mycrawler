Fisheries Research in Western Australia
Fisheries Research Contract Reports are usually, but not exclusively, written by staff from 
the Fisheries Research Division of the Department of Fisheries based at the Western 
Australian Marine Research Laboratories, PO Box 20, North Beach (Perth), Western 
Australia, 6920. The WA Marine Research Laboratories serve as the centre for fisheries 
research in the State of Western Australia.
Research programs conducted by the Fisheries Research Division and laboratories 
investigate basic fish biology, stock identity, stock assessment, population dynamics, 
environmental factors, and other factors related to the ecologically sustainable 
development of commercial fisheries, recreational fisheries and aquaculture fisheries.  
The Fisheries Research Division also maintains the State data base of fisheries catch 
and fishing effort statistics.
The primary function of the Fisheries Research Division is to provide scientific advice 
to government in the formulation of management policies for developing and sustaining 
Western Australian fisheries.

Objectives
1. To test performance of different settlement inducers at both the laboratory and 
commercial scale. 
2. To improve the rate and consistency of abalone larval settlement. 
3. To compare different microalgal diets for their nutritional value in terms of digestibility 
and growth.
4. To quantify the suitability of different microalgae for their ease of use, both for 
maintaining mass cultures and ability to recolonise settlement surfaces post grazing.
5. To increase growth and survival for the first two months of post-larval life at a 
commercial scale.
Non-technical summary
 Outcome achieved
1.0 Settlement: Laboratory experiments
1.1 Algal species: Results of laboratory experiments demonstrated that the macroalga 
Ulvella lens is a suitable settlement inducer for larvae of blacklip and greenlip 
abalone ( Haliotis rubra and Haliotis laevigata  respectively) . Settlement rates were 
improved from around 1-10% to 30-60%. Settlement was significantly lower on 
plates with biofilm dominated by diatom species. 
1.2 Age and developmental stage of settlement substrate: Settlement of H. rubra  
was higher on older compared to younger thalli of U. lens and diatom films. 
Settlement on U. lens appears to be reduced when previously inoculated with 
a diatom species. However inoculation with diatoms has advantages for the 
subsequent growth of the post-larvae.  
1.3 Pregrazed substrates: Settlement plates conditioned with algae ( U. lens  or 
diatoms) that were pre-grazed by juvenile abalone induced higher larval settlement 
for H. rubra  than plates that were not grazed prior to larval settlement.2                                                         Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                          31.4 Abalone species differences: Greenlip ( H. laevigata ) larvae show less species-
specific response. The difference between the algal species and developmental 
stages tested were not as pronounced than with blacklip ( H. rubra ) larvae.
1.5 Batch differences and use of antibiotics: Marked differences in overall settlement 
rates were found between larval batches. Antibiotic treatment enhanced the survival 
of H. rubra  larvae in experimental containers but did not enhance the settlement 
rate nor did it change settlement preferences. The results indicate that unfit larvae 
may survive if treated with antibiotics but they do not settle successfully.
2.0  Growth and survival: Laboratory experiments
2.1 Diatoms and U. lens : Growth-rates reached 30-40 µm day-1 when feeding on the 
cultured diatom Navicula  sp. during the first two months of rearing. The green 
alga U. lens  is not sufficient for the initial growth of the abalone H. rubra . When 
single species diets were compared to a combination of the macroalga U. lens  
and the diatom Navicula  sp., growth-rates reached 42 µm day-1 on the combined 
diet but only 35 µm day-1 on single species diets. Survival up to 2 months post 
settlement was highest on the combination (70%) and lowest on the diatom only.
2.2 Feeding capacity:
2.2.1 Post-larvae 0-4 weeks: Post-larvae rely on yolk reserves during the first 
2 weeks of development but can ingest small diatoms cells (<17 µm in valve 
length). Most of the nutrition must be derived from the biofilm components 
such as extracellular material produced by the diatoms and associated 
bacteria, because diatom cells were ingested but not digested and cells 
remained alive in faeces samples.
2.2.2 Juveniles 1-3 month: During the first months of post-larval life H. rubra  
grows best with the highest survival when feeding on diatom species like 
Navicula sp., which is well attached to the settlement substrate. U. lens is 
suitable as a food source once juveniles reach 3 mm in shell length (ca. 
2 month post-settlement) when growth rates become comparable to those 
juveniles feeding on diatoms.
3.0 Algal culture and biochemical composition of algae
3.1 Suitable diatom species for commercial culture on vertical plates: Only 
Navicula  sp. developed on vertical settlement plates in a satisfactory time frame. 
Other species either did not attach well or grew very slowly. 
3.2 Recommended commercial protocol for algal culture: Methods were developed 
for large-scale culture and succession of algal species. Plates were initially 
colonized with U. lens for settlement and after settlement inoculated with the 
cultured diatom Navicula  sp. for post-larval growth. Plates with recently settled 
larvae were inoculated without any harm to the animals.
3.3 Nitrogen level for algal culture:  10-fold increase in nitrate used in growth media 
resulted in higher total amino acid levels in the diatom feed species and an increase 2                                                         Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                          3in growth-rates of H. rubra  juveniles. We suggest, in order to achieve uniformity 
in nutritional quality of feed species in abalone nurseries, that the nitrogen level 
should be monitored and supplied at an optimal rate between 2 and 12 mg NO3-N L-1. 
3.4 Nutritional quality of Navicula sp. and U. lens  Navicula sp. is rich in 20:5n-3 
whereas the major fatty acids in U. lens include 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. U. lens  
shows a high protein content of 31-38% which is comparable to microalgae like 
Navicula sp. but not to other macroalgae.
4.0 Settlement: commercial scale 
Settlement rates in large-scale experiments in the nursery were amongst the highest recorded 
in commercial nurseries suggesting that the use of the macroalga U. lens  for conditioning 
the settlement plates was efficient and reliable. 
4.1 Larval release density:  Larval release density was not detected as a significant 
effect on settlement rates of H. rubra . 
4.2 U. lens age, cover and developmental stage:  The settlement of H. rubra and 
H. laevigata  larvae was higher on older U. lens plates with less percentage cover 
indicating that the developmental stage of U. lens and associated biofilm species 
and not the cover per se are important. Larvae of two abalone species ( H. rubra, 
H. laevigata ) can distinguish between different developmental stages of the alga.
5.0 Growth and survival: commercial scale
5.1 U. lens  and Navicula  sp.: Growth rates of H. rubra on a combination of U. lens  
and Navicula  sp. were improved at commercial scale to 35 µm day-1 during the 
first month, 50 µm day-1 during the second month and 100 µm day-1 during the 
third month of rearing.  
5.2 Animal density and light : Post-larval density and light (which affects the food 
density) have very remarkable effects on early growth (first month of post-larval 
development) of H. rubra . Interestingly, this difference in early growth remained 
and was amplified until the end of the experiment, suggesting that early growth is 
important in determining later performances. The survival was strongly density-
dependent about 2 months after settlement when the food started to become 
limiting. Growth of juveniles increased by 3 fold in a few days when the density 
was reduced to less than 50 juveniles per plate ca. 2 months after settlement.
5.3 Formulated feed:  The formulated feed used might not be well matched for the 
nutritional requirements of small H. laevigata  juveniles. Feed might be suitable 
for juveniles larger than 4 mm in shell length.
5.4 Feeding capacity:
5.4.1  Post-larvae 0-4 weeks: During early development post-larvae rely on lipid 
reserves of the larval yolk for their nutrition. The yolk reserves are exhausted 
approximately 2 weeks after settlement when growth rates decreased 
presumably because the post-larvae started feeding inefficiently on the 
diatoms.                            4                                                         Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                          55.4.2  Post-larvae 1-3 months old: When animals reached ca. 2 mm in shell 
length the growth-rates improved substantially indicating that juveniles can 
fully access the diatom feed provided. This is also the time when the first 
respiratory pore is formed. Juveniles started to remove parts of U. lens about 
2 months after settlement, when they reached 3 mm in shell length, which 
was evident by a sharp decline in percentage cover of U. lens  and growth-
rates increased substantially ( H. rubra, H. laevigata ).
6.0 Recommendations to industry
6.1 Settlement protocol:  We recommend that plates colonised with young germlings 
of U. lens, grown for a period of 2 weeks, so that algae cover ca. 30-40% of the 
plate, should be used for the settlement induction of abalone larvae ( H. rubra, 
H. laevigata) . 
6.2 Recommended feeds for juveniles
6.2.1 Juveniles 1-3 months:  Plates inoculated with the cultured diatom Navicula 
sp. will provide suitable food and rapid growth of young post-larvae. This 
species produces extracellular mucus and is therefore suitable for early 
post-larval growth (first 4 weeks post-settlement). This species will sustain 
good growth until juveniles reach about 3 mm in shell length (H. rubra, 
H. laevigata ).
6.2.2 Juveniles 3 months + : We suggest that plates covered with the green alga 
U. lens should be used as a food source for juvenile abalone larger than 
3 mm in shell length. New plates covered by the algae should be introduced 
every 3-4 weeks and the stocking density should be reduced to 50 juveniles 
per plate (H. rubra, H. laevigata ). That way high growth rates of 80-100 µm 
day-1 can be maintained on this feed until juveniles reach 8-10 mm in shell 
length (H. laevigata ).

1.1 Background
Australian abalone fisheries produce a high value, export-orientated products that provided 
60% of the world supply in 1994 (Fleming, 2000). With wild abalone fisheries declining in 
countries worldwide, the interest in aquaculture products has increased substantially. The world 
production of abalone from aquaculture in 1999 was approximately 7,775 tonnes with only 
89 tonnes (ca. 1%) being produced in Australia (Fleming, 2000). Abalone farming is expected 
to develop into a major industry and is a significant investment opportunity (McNamara, 
Victorian Aquaculture Strategy, May 1997). Future production from the numerous farms and 
sites either established, under construction or approved in Australia, could be substantial. 
In Australia abalone larvae are produced by spawning recently collected wild broodstock, or 
wild or farmed abalone broodstock that has been held in conditioning systems for extended 
periods. The non-feeding larvae have a short larval phase e.g. 7 days at 17 ° C for Haliotis 
rubra . When larvae are ready for settlement they actively seek a suitable surface. In the natural 
environment abalone larvae settle on coralline red algae (Shepherd & Daume, 1996); however 
on farms the surface is typically vertical, spaced plastic plates that have been colonised by 
a variety of different microalgal species. When algal supplies decline, the juveniles may be 
weaned onto formulated feeds. They can be transferred to a variety of land- based tanks or 
sea- based systems (Freeman, 2001).
Abalone are slow growing, therefore any increased growth-rates resulting in a reduction in 
production time, have large cost benefits to the farmer. While some information is known 
about the early life history of abalone, very little of this information can be applied directly in 
commercial nurseries. The main areas of research to increase growth rates for juvenile abalone 
are in the following:
1.  settlement systems design
2.  dietary requirements for settled abalone
3.  pre-settlement larvae quality
4.  optimum water quality and other environment conditions for growth promotion
5.  genetic improvement of abalone
1. Settlement  
Benthic biofilm consisting of bacteria and mixed species of diatoms growing on PVC settlement 
plates have traditionally been used as a settlement substrate in abalone nurseries worldwide. 
This process is unpredictable and larval settlement rates can be very low (1-10% of larvae). 
Enhanced settlement up to 80% has been obtained in small scale experiments through the use of 
the non-geniculate coralline red  alga, Sporolithon durum  (Daume et al., 1999b) . In a previous 
study Haliotis rubra  did not respond to films of any diatom species tested, but settled on the 
non-geniculate coralline red alga Phymatolithon repandum  (Daume et al., 1999a). In contrast 
Haliotis laevigata settled particularly well on the diatom  Navicula ramosissima (Daume 
et al., 1999b). Other diatom species, however, sustained poor settlement. Despite this result 
naturally developing diatom films are readily used as a settlement substrate for H. rubra  and 
H. laevigata larvae in southern Australia. Without much control over composition and density of 
the biofilm species settlement rates are very inconsistent and often very poor (1-10%). Greater 
control is achieved by isolating particular diatom species and growing them in monoculture 6                                                         Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                          7before inoculating settlement tanks in the nursery. This however has not been embraced by the 
industry because they feel that the gain does not justify the extra costs involved for the scale-up 
diatom culture on site. Further investigations are needed to assess the effectiveness in larger 
scale culture systems for diatoms in the nursery environment. 
Hatcheries in Japan culture the macroalga Ulvella lens  to improve settlement of the Japanese 
abalone Haliotis discus hannai (Takahashi & Koganezawa, 1988). Settlement rates of 67% 
where reported on U. lens which was not previously grazed by juvenile abalone by Takahashi 
and Koganezawa (1988). Pregrazed U. lens  yield a settlement rate of 93-100% (Takahashi & 
Koganezawa, 1988; Seki, 1997). The settlement on U. lens  had never been investigated with 
Australian species of abalone.
2. Dietary requirements
Post-larval abalone feed on benthic diatoms (Kawamura et al., 1995), so the diatom film 
on which animals settle also provides the feed for the growing post-larvae. The film is 
maintained through passive seeding  (new cells are brought in with the incoming seawater), 
adding nutrients and manipulating the light intensity through shading. However, a significant 
bottleneck experienced by industry is the inability to maintain adequate feed (both quantity and 
quality) on the plates particularly at later stages of the nursery phase. Commercial operations 
have traditionally relied on mixed species of diatoms as an initial food source throughout the 
nursery period (settled larvae to 8-10 mm). Worldwide, only a few studies have examined post-
larval feeding and growth on different algal species and little is known about initial growth-rates 
of recently settled post-larvae (Ohgai et al., 1991; Ishida et al., 1995; Kawamura et al., 1998a; 
Roberts et al., 1999). Feeding experiments of post-larval abalone on species of benthic diatoms 
(Kawamura & Kikuchi, 1992; Kawamura & Takami, 1995; Kawamura et al., 1995; Matthews 
& Cook, 1995; Kawamura, 1996) have shown that feed requirements may change as abalone 
grow. Two to three weeks after settlement post-larvae become responsive to the “digestibility” 
of the diatom strains and grow more rapidly on effectively digested strains (Kawamura et al., 
1998a). Post-larvae 0.8-2 mm in shell length grow ca 40-60 μm day-1 on “digestible” diatoms 
and only ca 15-30 μm day-1 on “indigestible” diatoms (Kawamura et al., 1998b). In addition, 
the diatom cell size, attachment strength, frustule’s strength and post-larval size can influence 
digestion. In a feeding trial covering the whole post-larval period, Roberts et al. (1999) showed 
that different diatom feed species affected both survival and growth. After day 17, post-larvae 
grew faster on Cocconeis scutellum  and Cylindrotheca closterium . Both species were most 
efficiently digested. Seki (1997) reported that growth rates of post-larvae on U. lens  were 
improved by the inoculation of cultured diatoms. However, research on post-larval feeding 
preferences has not been undertaken on Australian species of abalone. It is well known that 
adults of Australasian species of abalone vary in feeding preference and favour red macroalgae 
(Rhodophyta) compared to species from America, South Africa and Japan, which prefer brown 
algae (Phaeophyta) (McShane et al., 1994, Fleming, 1995). The food requirements of post-
larvae and juveniles may also differ. In addition, feeding experiments were mainly done on 
monocultures of diatoms rather than on mixed cultures developing naturally on settlement 
plates in a hatchery situation. Post-larvae have not been offered a choice between different 
diatom strains and the change in feed requirements during the first weeks of post-larval life 
has not been investigated.8                                                         Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                          9The aims of this project are to:
• determine and quantify the performance of different settlement inducers, both separately 
and in combination within the laboratory and at a commercial scale, in order to develop a 
practical settlement protocol for abalone farms.
• improve the settlement rate and consistency of abalone larval settlement.
• compare different microalgal diets for their nutritional value in terms of digestibility and 
growth.
• determine the suitability of different microalgae for their ease of use, both for maintaining 
mass cultures and ability to recolonise settlement surfaces.
• develop a succession of algal food species for post-larvae that will sustain maximum 
growth and survival for the first two months of post-larval life at a commercial scale.
1.2 Need
Abalone farming can be improved in Australia. The profit will be increased and the cost and 
risk of production reduced. Key strategies in this project have been:
• increased knowledge of the settlement process and development of a better settlement 
system resulting in more reliable production and lower cost juvenile abalone which is 
essential for both integrated (hatchery and growout) abalone farms and for the supply of 
seed to growout farms;
• the development of a practical settlement protocol for abalone requires a greater 
understanding of microalgae requirements and their culture and should reduce the cost for 
juvenile abalone as well as reducing the risk of not meeting annual seed production for the 
start of the growout stage;
• the project will be integrated into the Abalone Aquaculture Subprogram and has extensive 
industry involvement in developing the practical applications;
• the success of the Australian abalone aquaculture industry is dependent on developing 
methods that reduce costs in labour and growout time; 
• the project will deliver information that can result in technically advanced culture methods 
that will maintain a competitive edge over countries with low labour costs.

2.1 Aims
Experiments were designed to investigate if settlement is species specific for a variety of algal 
species tested and if differences in percentage cover, age and/or developmental stage of the 
algae influence the settlement rate (Table 1). To achieve similar percentage cover of different 
developmental stages, reducing or adding more spores to the culture manipulated the number 
of spores per area.  In addition, the antibiotics Ampicilin and Kanamycin (50 µg mL-1) were 
used in one experiment with H. rubra larvae to investigate the influence of the antibiotics on 
the settlement substrata (algae), larvae and overall settlement rates (Table 1).
2.2 Methods
2.2.1  Algal cultures
Five diatom species, Navicula sp., Navicula jeffreyi Hallegraeff et Burford,  Cylindrotheca 
closterium (Ehrenberg) Reimann et Lewin, Amphora  sp. and Cocconeis sp., were isolated 
from settlement plates at Southern Ocean Mariculture in Victoria, Australia and maintained 
in culture (Plate 1). Diatom species were cultured in f/2 medium (Guillard & Ryther, 1962) 
and maintained at 17 ± 2°  C, with a 12 : 12 hours L : D photo cycle. The cultures were not 
axenic. For the settlement experiments, all diatom species were cultured for 1-2 weeks and 
allowed to attach to small plastic squares (2 cm2) until they reached a density of approximately 
105 cells cm-2.
Thalli of Sporolithon durum (Foslie) Townsend et Woelkerling with patches of Sori 
(reproductive structures) were selected and placed in small aquaria with a 12 : 12 hours L:D 
photo cycle. The water temperature was raised to 2-4° C above ambient temperature to induce 
the release of spores. Spores are negatively buoyant, hence small plastic squares (2 cm2) were 
placed onto the bottom of the tank to collect them. 
Spores attached to the squares and germinated during the next 24 hours. Plastic squares with 
more than 50 germlings were selected and used in settlement experiments. The germlings were 
grown for 5 and 10 days and reached a diameter of 10-100 and 100-150 µm respectively.
Settlement plates with large patches of Ulvella lens Crouan were collected from the commercial 
nursery. Some of the plates had been previously grazed by juvenile abalone (2-3 mm shell 
length). Plates of both treatments (with or without pregrazing) were cut into 2 cm2 squares. 
In other settlement experiments germlings and mature (spore producing) U. lens were 
compared. Methods for spore collection were adapted from Takahshi & Koganezawa (1988) 
(see below for large scale culture methods). After 1-2 weeks germlings reached a diameter of 
100-300 µm. Germlings were grown for an additional 2 weeks to develop sporangia (mature 
plant). Six small squares (2 cm2) were cut from a randomly selected position of six randomly 
taken settlement plates. 12                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        13Some squares with germlings of S. durum and U. lens were inoculated with the diatom 
Navicula sp. for the fourth and sixth experiment and cultured in f/2 medium until densities of 
104 cells cm-2 were reached.
2.2.2  Experimental protocol
All batches of Haliotis rubra  Leach larvae (1-13), batch 1 and 3 of Haliotis laevigata Donovan 
larvae and one batch of hybrids ( Haliotis rubra  x H. laevigata ) were reared at Southern 
Ocean Mariculture (SOM) in Victoria, Australia (Table 1).

All experiments conducted with these larvae were run in the laboratory at SOM. Batch 2 
of Haliotis laevigata larvae were obtained from South Australian Abalone Development in 
South Australia. Settlement experiments with this batch were conducted at the Lincoln Marine 
Science Centre in South Australia.  
Only larvae from the same batch were used in each experiment. Larvae were judged to be 
competent for settlement when the third tubule of the cephalic tentacle was well developed 
and larvae began exploring the surface (Hahn, 1989). The density of abalone larvae was 
estimated by counting the larvae in ten 1 mL sub samples drawn from the whole sample of 
the batch. 
Settlement substrata (approximately 2 cm2 plastic squares and pieces of the non-geniculate 
coralline red alga Sporolithon durum ) were placed in 250 mL jars with 100 ± 5 larvae each. 
For each experiment, each replicate piece of S. durum  or square of settlement plate was 
obtained from a different plant or plate to ensure independence. Negative control: 1 cm2 piece of settlement plate without diatoms or other algae.
Positive control: ca. 1 cm2 piece of the non-geneculate corralline red alga Sporolithon durum.16                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        17Both no-choice and choice experiments are used in this study. In a no-choice experiment, all 
levels of the experimental factor are tested separately in contrast to the choice experiment 
(block design) where the levels of the one factor are tested together to offer larvae a choice 
between the different substrata. The block design was chosen because we considered it to be 
closer to the natural situation. Larvae experience some degree of choice between different 
substrata and are unlikely to only encounter one possible substratum.  
Larval behaviour was observed under a dissecting microscope. The term “settlement” describes 
the permanent attachment of the larvae to the substrate after shedding of the velum to complete 
metamorphosis. Both initial shell-growth (visible after 24 hours) and ciliary processes in the 
mantle cavity indicated that metamorphosis was completed (Hahn, 1989).
Jars with plastic squares without diatoms or other algae were used as controls for each 
experiment (negative control). In most experiments positive controls were used and consisted 
of jars with a piece of the non-geniculate coralline red alga Sporolithon durum . Jars from all 
experiments were kept at 17 ± 2°  C, with a 12 : 12 hours L : D photo cycle. Settled larvae 
were counted under a dissecting microscope 24 and 48 or 72 or 96 hours after the larvae were 
added.
2.2.3  Data analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using the STATISTICA computer package. Numbers of 
settled larvae after 24 hours (not percentages) were analysed. Assumption of normality and 
homogeneity of variance was checked graphically for each data set. One-way ANOV As with 
Tukey HSD tests were used for all “no-choice” experiments. Data of experiment 3-6 were 
analysed as repeated measure ANOV As to assess the change over time. Substrata were not 
independent in ”choice” experiments and consequently, data from these experiments were 
analysed using paired t-tests. 
2.3 Results 
A summary of results for laboratory scale settlement experiments is given in Table 1. Details 
of specific results follow below. Results of experiments conducted with larvae of the abalone 
Haliotis rubra are presented first followed by experiments with Haliotis laevigata  and one 
experiment with a batch of hybrids ( Haliotis rubra x Haliotis laevigata ). Not all batches are 
discussed in the following section, however an overview of main findings is given. Further 
details can be found in Table 1.
2.3.1  Settlement experiments with Haliotis rubra  larvae
The settlement rate was very low on all single species diatom films and ranged between 1%-
6% (Figure 1A, Table 1: Batch 1, Exp. 1). Only the settlement rates on films of Cylindrotheca 
closterium and Amphora sp. were significantly different to the negative control (p < 0.05). 
Overall a settlement rate of 3% was calculated after 24 hours, which did not increase between 
24 and 48 hours. The hierarchy in settlement response changed when the experiment was 
repeated in different month (Figure 1B, Table 1: Batch 6, Exp. 1). There was a significant 
difference between films of Navicula sp. and the control (p < 0.05) and between films of 
Cocconeis sp. and the control (p < 0.001). However, the overall settlement was still very low 
and ranged between 1%-6%.16                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        17New isolates of diatoms were tested in experiments with batch number 10. The settlement rates 
were slightly higher and varied between 3-14%, however, settlement was higher on Ulvella 
lens than any of the monospecific diatom films. 
Significantly more larvae of batch 3 (Table 1: Batch 3, Exp. 2) settled on a mixed film of 
Navicula  sp. and  Amphora  sp. than on a film of Amphora  sp. alone ( t-test, p < 0.001) (Table 2).
In contrast, significantly fewer larvae settled on a mixed film of Cocconeis  sp. and Amphora  
sp. than on a film of Amphora  sp. alone ( t-test, p < 0.001).

The settlement rate was 19% (7% + 12%) in the first set comparing Amphora  sp. and a mix 
of Navicula  sp./Amphora  and 21% (13% + 8%) in the second set comparing Amphora  sp. 
and a mix of Cocconeis sp./Amphora  sp.
Significantly higher settlement was achieved on mature thalli of S. durum  compared to plates 
with S. durum germlings and the negative control (p < 0.001) (Figure 2, Table 1: Batch 4, Exp. 
2). No significant difference was found between the two treatments of the S. durum germlings 
(p > 0.05). There was a significant difference between the 24 and 48 hours count (p < 0.05). 
The settlement increased on the whole thallus of S. durum  between 24 and 48 hours (Figure 
2). However, no difference was found on squares with 10-day-old germlings and the number 
of settled larvae decreased on squares with 5-day-old germlings after 48 hours. 
Significantly higher settlement occurred on S. durum germlings inoculated with the diatom 
Navicula sp. compared to plates with a film of Navicula  sp. alone (p < 0.05) (Figure 3, Table 1: 
Batch 6, Exp. 3). There was no significant difference between the diatom film and the negative 
control (p > 0.05). No significant difference between the 24 and 48 hours count was found 
(p > 0.05). All treatments increased slightly between 24 and 48 hours.

Significantly more larvae settled on the grazed squares of U. lens compared to the ungrazed 
squares (p < 0.05) and both were significantly different to the negative control (p < 0.05 and p 
< 0.001 respectively) (Figure 4, Table 1: Batch 6, Exp. 2). There was a significant difference 
between the 24 and 48 hours count (p < 0.05). The settlement rate was 12% on ungrazed plates 
and 23% on grazed plates of U. lens after 24 hours and increased to 20% and 36% respectively 
after 48 hours. 
Settlement was significantly higher on plates with U. lens  compared to the  diatom film of 
Navicula sp. and plates with U. lens  inoculated with the diatom Navicula sp. (p < 0.001) 
(Figure 5, Table 1: Batch 9, Exp. 2). Settlement was higher on plates with U. lens  inoculated 
with Navicula sp. than on films of Navicula sp. alone but this difference was not significant 
(p > 0.05). Overall a settlement rate of 3% on the diatom film, 9% on U. lens  inoculated with 
the diatom and 52% on pure U. lens  was calculate after 24 hours. Between 24 and 72 hours 
the settlement rate increased to 5%, 12% in the first two treatments but decreased to 44% in 
the last treatment. 
The settlement rate was significantly higher on 2 and 4-week-old U. lens both with high 
percentage cover (85-100% cover) compared to U. lens spores covering 3-5% of the plates 
(p < 0.05) (Table 3) (Table 1: Batch 11, Exp.1). There was however no significant difference 
between 2 and 4 week old U. lens  (p > 0.05). After 24 hours a settlement rate of 27% was 
found on the older and 32% on the younger U. lens , whereas only 12% of the larvae settled on 
U. lens spores.20                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        21Table 3.

No significant difference was found between any treatment combination with and without the 
antibiotics Ampicilin and Kanamycin (p > 0.05) (Table 4, Table 1: Batch 13, Exp.1). In all 
cases the settlement rate after 24 and 48 hours was lower or similar on the substrate treated 
with antibiotics compared to untreated substrate of the same species. The settlement was 
significantly higher on both macro-algae U. lens  and S. durum (positive control) compared to 
the diatom film of Navicula sp. and the negative control (p < 0.05). One week after the initial 
count, 54% of larvae were still swimming in control jars with antibiotic treatment (Table 4). 
Significantly fewer larvae (3%) were still active in the control jars without antibiotics 
(p < 0.001). More larvae survived up to 1 week on U. lens  treated with antibiotics and fewer 
larvae survived on the treated Navicula sp. film compared to the same untreated species, but 
this difference was not significant.22                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        23Table 4.

2.3.2  Settlement experiments with Haliotis laevigata larvae
Settlement rates were highly variable on single species diatom films and ranged between 
2%-20% (Figure 7, Table 1: Batch 2, Exp. 1). Films of Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula  sp. 
and Amphora sp. were significantly different to the negative control after 24 hours (p < 0.05). 
However no difference was found between Cocconeis sp. and the negative control. Settlement 
was highest on C. closterium  (20%) followed by Navicula  sp. and Amphora sp. and lowest on 
Cocconeis sp. (6%).  The settlement rate did not increase after 48 hours and is therefore not 
presented here.  
Settlement was significantly higher on younger than older films of C. closterium  (p < 0.001) 
but not difference was found between the two Navicula  sp. treatments (p > 0.05) (Table 5, 
Table 1: Batch 2, Exp. 3). Only younger films of both species were significantly different to the 
negative control (p < 0.001). The cell density ranged between 103 to 104 cells per cm2 (Table 
6). No significant difference in cell density was found between the young and old film of 
C. closterium . However old films of Navicula  sp. showed significantly higher cell density than 
young films (t-test, p < 0.05).
There was no significant difference between single species ( Navicula sp., Cylindrotheca 
closterium ) and mixed species film ( Navicula sp. and Cylindrotheca closterium ) (p > 0.05) 
(Figure 8, Table 1: Batch 1, Exp. 2). The settlement ranged from 3-11%. 
The settlement was highest on mature Ulvella lens and ranged from 16-17% (Figure 9, Table 
1: Batch 3, Exp. 1). Mature U. lens induced more larvae to settle than young germlings of 
U. lens  (Figure 9). However, settlement was significantly higher on the positive control 
(Sporolithon durum ) compared to all U. lens treatments (p < 0.001). Only S. durum  and two  
U. lens  treatments with the highest percentage cover were significantly different to the negative 
control (p < 0.05). 
Settlement was reduced if plates with U. lens  were inoculated with the diatom cultures Navicula 
sp. before larval settlement (Figure 10, Table 1: Batch 2, Exp. 2). Both  U. lens  treatments (with 
and without diatoms) were significantly different to the negative control (p < 0.05).22                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        230510152025% settlement

2.4 Discussion 
A small experimental system (250 mL jars with 100 competent larvae in each) was chosen 
for the first stage of this project, to allow screening a variety of different settlement cues and 
maintaining a high level of replication. The system was static (not slow flowing like in the 
nursery) and the substrate was presented horizontally (not vertically like the settlement plates in 
the nursery tanks). However, the purpose here was to test for difference in settlement induction 
between different substrates within one batch of larvae and select for promising candidates 
for the larger scale experiments in the nursery. The results of the settlement experiments 
cannot be compared across batches because the quality of the larvae can strongly influence 24                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        25the settlement rate. Results across treatments and experiments, with larvae of the same batch, 
are not influenced by the larval quality and can thus indicate the strength of a settlement cue. 
The very high settlement rates on the positive control ( Sporolithon durum ) showed that the 
system is suitable and also served as a quality control of the batches i.e. if settlement is poor 
on S. durum , then larval quality and/ or environmental conditions are probably infavourable. 
The negative control provides an indication of random settlement and results show that larvae 
are very selective. 
2.4.1  Settlement of H. rubra
Larvae of the abalone H. rubra  did not respond well to any of the diatom species tested (Figure 
1A, B) but settled well in response to the positive control, the non-geniculate coralline red 
alga Sporolithon durum (see Table 1, Batch 1). This is in agreement with a previous study, 
which showed that H. rubra did not respond to any of the diatom films tested but settled on 
the non-geniculate coralline red alga, Phymatolithon repandum  (Daume et al., 1999a). The 
inconsistency in the hierarchy of diatom species in terms of settlement rates might have been 
caused by differences in culture conditions and production of extra cellular material by the 
algae at the time of larval settlement. The diatom strains in the previous study were obtained 
from a culture collection in New Zealand but belong to the same genera than the ones tested 
in this study. Both studies indicate that monospecific diatom strains are not particularly useful 
for the settlement of H. rubra . In contrast, Roberts and Nicholson (1997) and Kawamura 
and Kikuchi (1992) showed that Cocconeis scutellum  induced high settlement of the abalone 
H. virginea  and H. discus hannai  respectively . Other diatoms species such as Navicula 
ramosissima  also induced high settlement rates of H. discus hannai  (Kawamura & Kikuchi, 
1992) and H. laevigata (Daume et al., 1999a). 
2.4.2  Settlement of H. laevigata
In this study, H. laevigata showed variable responses on mono-specific diatom films (Figure 7).
Species of the same genus Navicula sp. and Cylindrotheca sp. sustained good settlement (up 
to 80-90%) in a previous study conducted with  H. laevigata  larvae (Daume et al. 1999a). In 
addition, also Amphora  sp. showed a significant response in this study but other species like 
Cocconeis sp. did not sustain good settlement. Overall settlement rates cannot be compared 
across studies because batch quality can influence the results as explained above. The results 
however indicate that the settlement response to monospecific diatom films is species specific 
and diatoms may be useful for the settlement of some abalone species. 
Only younger films with a lower cell density showed significant settlement when compared to 
the negative control (Table 5). In a previous study younger films (3 and 5 days old) showed 
significantly lower settlement that older films (14 and 19 days old) (Daume et al. 1999a). 
However when cell densities are compared, at least the cell density of the Navicula sp. was 
well below the cell density of the best performing films in the previous study. In addition, a 
strong correlation between cell density and larval settlement was found with these treatments 
in the previous study. This suggests that cell densities tested here might have been too low and 
films should have been cultured for a longer period of time to achieve higher cell densities 
before settlement induction.
Settlement on mixed cultures of diatoms achieved higher settlement but this depended on the 
species combination. If only naturally developing diatom films are used in an abalone nursery, 
the species combination on the settlement plate is very unpredictable and varies among 26                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        27and between plates and seasons. The result from the second settlement experiment indicate 
that settlement plates in the nursery can produce inconsistent and variable settlement rates 
if species combinations are not monitored and controlled. The occurrence of diatoms is 
also greatly dependent on the season, a factor that needs to be considered further because 
abalone hatcheries in Australia are currently moving towards broodstock conditioning and 
off-season spawning. 
Even small germlings of S. durum are sufficient for the settlement induction, but the settlement 
rate is lower than on pieces of the whole thallus of the alga. The germlings used might have 
been too young and need to be cultured over a longer period of time to improve settlement 
rates. The settlement on germlings inoculated with the diatom Navicula sp. was however 
higher than on the diatom alone,  indicating that most of the settlement response can be 
associated with the germlings. The use of S. durum germlings for the settlement induction in 
abalone nurseries has not been fully explored. However, coralline red algae are slow growing 
in temperate waters and seasonal in tetraspore production. Culturing on a large scale to induce 
abalone larval settlement in the nursery would need appropriate time with an estimate of at 
least 3-4 weeks to inoculate settlement plates and several months to establish the next spore 
producing generation.
2.4.3  Settlement on Ulvella lens  
In the present study, we showed for the first time that larvae of the Australian abalone 
H. rubra  settle on the encrusting, green alga U. lens. The settlement can be enhanced if U. lens 
is pregrazed by conspecific abalone. Similarly, Takahashi and Koganezawa (1988) reported 
that U. lens , which had been pregrazed by conspecific juveniles, induced higher settlement 
than the ungrazed alga. Settlement induced by conspecific grazing mucus has been described 
for other abalone species (Seki & Kan-no, 1981; Slattery, 1992). In this study we showed 
that the settlement of the abalone H. rubra is higher on the macroalga U. lens than on diatom 
films. Naturally developing diatom films on plastic plates are currently predominantly used as 
the settlement cue in abalone nurseries in Australia. This study suggests that settlement plates 
seeded with U. lens could induce high and consistent settlement of H. rubra  (see below). 
In addition, H. laevigata settled well on U. lens , however the difference between the settlement 
on U. lens compared to some diatom films was not as pronounced as in experiments conducted 
with H. rubra larvae. The response to diatoms was, however, variable and depended on 
species and age of the film. This indicates that diatoms might be useful for the settlement of 
H. laevigata  but more experiments are needed to determine differences between diatom 
species and cell density as well as large-scale inoculation and management of films dominated 
by other diatom species. 
The results however, warrant the use of U. lens in large-scale trials in the nursery (see Chapter 5).
2.4.4  Settlement assays with antibiotics
No differences were found between the settlement rates on substrates treated with and without 
antibiotics (Table 4). The ratios between treated and untreated substrates did not change over 
time. The difference between specific substrates stayed the same regardless if antibiotics were 
used or not. The antibiotics were most likely effective, which was indicated by the higher 
survival in control jars treated with antibiotics. This indicates that even if more larvae survive 
in jars treated with antibiotics, those larvae do not influence the overall result e.g. no more 26                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        27larvae choose to settle on diatom films treated with antibiotics. In this study we showed that 
when the antibiotic combination Kanamycin and Ampicillin is used at 50 µg mL-1, the larval 
survival is higher than on untreated films. However, the settlement rate was not higher in the 
antibiotic treatment, indicating that unfit larvae might survive if treated with antibiotic but they 
do not settle successfully.

3.1 Aim 
The aim of the following experiments has been to assess the growth and survival of H. rubra 
and H. laevigata  post-larvae feeding on different algal species.
3.2 Methods
3.2.1  Static system
Larvae were settled onto small plastic sheets with algal feed species and maintained in glass 
jars (250 mL) without water flow. The seawater was filtered to 1 μm and replaced every 
3-4 days. The shell length of post-larvae was measured before and every week up to 4 weeks 
after the experiment started.
3.2.2  Flow through system 
A flow through system, utilizing large petri dishes of ca. 250 mL capacity, with a constant 
flow of 20 mL min-1 of 1 μm filtered seawater in each, was installed (Figure 11). Dishes 
with algal feed were rinsed in flow for 1 hour to remove medium. Plates with U. lens  and 
pieces of S. durum  were collected from the nursery and placed into petri dishes in the flow. 
Six settled larvae were transferred into each of 4 replicate dishes of the same algal species. 
If not noted otherwise in Table 7, post-larvae were ca. 300 μm in shell length at the start of 
the experiments.
All post-larvae used within one experiment were derived from the same batch. Post-larvae 
were fed every 2-3 days with 30-50 mL of diatom cultures per dish to maintain a cell density 
of approximately 105 cells cm-2. Post-larvae fed U. lens  and S. durum  did not receive any 
diatoms. Animals feeding on formulated food were fed every 2-3 days with 1 mL of feed 
suspension per dish. The formulated feed was previously suspended at a ratio of 5 g 100 mL-1. 
Food (formulated or cultured algae) of all trials were never consumed completely and always 
offered in excess.
The shell length of post-larvae were measured before being added to the dishes at weekly 
intervals. Growth rates of post-larvae were calculated. Faecal samples and the bottom of the 
grazed dishes were examined for broken valves to investigate if diatom cell contents are 
available to post-larvae as a food source.
3.2.3  Algal culture
Diatom species were cultured in f/2 medium over 1-2 weeks at 17 ± 2 ° C with a 12 L: 12 
D photo cycle and allowed to attach to small plastic squares (2 cm2) (static system) or the 
bottom of the petri dishes (flow through system) until they reached a density of approximately 
105 cells cm-2. 28                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        29Water Inlet

Methods for U. lens spore collection were adapted from Takahshi & Koganezawa (1988) (see 
chapter 4 for large scale culture methods). Spores were collected on plastic squares (static 
system) or the bottom of the petri dishes (flow through system). After 1-2 weeks, germlings 
reached a diameter of 100-300 µm. Germlings were grown for an additional 2 weeks to reach 
maturity. Dishes or plastic squares were inoculated with the diatom Navicula sp. for the 
combination treatment and cultured for an additional 2 weeks until a density of approximately 
105 cells cm-2 was reached.
3.2.4  Estimates of cell density of diatoms 
Sub samples of specific and species combinations were taken and the number of cells was 
recorded in 15 randomly chosen fields of view at a  magnification of 400 x. The number of 
cells cm-2 was calculated.
3.2.5  Data analysis
Data of abalone growth rates were analysed as a repeated measure analyses of variance. Data 
were also analysed separately for each measurement using one-way ANOV As with Tukey 
HSD tests. 30                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        313.3 Results 
A summary of all results for the laboratory scale settlement experiments are given in Table 7. 
Results of experiments conducted with larvae of H. rubra are presented first followed by 
experiments with H. laevigata  and one experiment with a batch of hybrids ( H. rubra x 
H. laevigata ). Results of experiments of each species are presented in chronological 
order starting with the spawning season 1998/99. Details of specific results follow below. 
If not indicated, experiments were started 1 week after settlement when post-larvae reached 
300-400 µm in shell length.
3.3.1  Growth experiments with Haliotis rubra
Experiment 1 and 2
These experiments can be regarded as one long experiment stretching over a 2-month period. 
Post-larvae were fed with a small variety of Navicula jeffryi  (ca. 5 μm valve length). This 
diatom species grow well in suspension but does not attach well to the substrate and gets 
easily dislodged in flow. The average growth was 25 ± 5 μm day-1 for recently settled post-
larvae (Table 7: Exp. 1) and 35 ± 6 μm day-1 for 1 month old post-larvae (Exp. 2). The survival 
was only 17% during the first month. Dead animals were replaced with post-larvae of similar 
shell length and feeding history and the survival increased to 58% during the second month 
(Exp. 2). 
Experiment 3
At the end of the 11-week experiment, films of the larger variety of Navicula sp. (13 μm in 
valve length) produced the largest post-larvae with an average of 3200 μm in shell length 
(Figure 12, Table 7: Exp. 3). Post-larvae feeding on the macroalgae U. lens were the smallest 
with an average of 1.2 mm in shell length. Post-larvae feeding on Navicula sp. showed the 
highest growth-rate (Table 8). 30                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        31Table 7.

were 300 µm in shell length at the start of the experiment.

Figure 12.   Early growth of Haliotis rubra  post-larvae feeding on different algal species. Vertical bars 
indicate the standard error; n = 4 replicated dishes with 6 post-larvae each.
The growth-rates of post-larvae grazing on any of the four diatom species were significant 
higher than on the macroalgae U. lens and S. durum  (p < 0.05) . Post-larvae survived best 
on the diatom Navicula sp. Survival was low on the diatom C. closterium and the macroalga 
U. lens . When weekly growth rates were analysed separately, there was no significant 
difference during the first week after settlement (p > 0.05) (Figure 12). Two weeks after 
settlement the difference between U. lens  and the diatom species was established (p < 0.05). By 
week 3, post-larvae growing on U. lens or S. durum  showed significantly lower growth-rates 
to those feeding on the diatom species (p < 0.05). In addition, differences among the diatom 
species first became apparent three weeks after settlement. Post-larvae feeding on Navicula 
spp. showed higher growth-rates three weeks after settlement compared to Cocconeis sp. and 
C. closterium . 
Diatom cells of all but one diatom species appeared in faecal samples from the beginning 
of the trial, indicating that cells of all diatom species were ingested. However, valves of 
C. closterium , as opposed to whole cells, were not detected before 3 weeks after settlement. 
Most diatom valves of all other diatom species were still intact and unbroken in faecal samples 
up to 3 weeks after settlement. Broken valves without cellular content of the Navicula spp. 
appeared in faecal samples three weeks after settlement. The mean cell size of Cocconeis sp. 
decreased during the trial and most cells of Cocconeis sp. measured only 1 μm in diameter at 
the end of the trial.
Experiment 4
Two different feed species, a larger size Navicula sp. (13 μm in length) and an Amphora sp., 
were compared in this trial (Table 7: Exp. 4). The Navicula sp. attaches well to the substrate, 
even in flow, but does not grow to high densities when using conventional methods of diatom 34                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        35mass cultures. Post-larvae showed a significantly better growth rate on Navicula sp. (25 ± 4 
μm day-1) compared to Amphora  sp. (13 ± 3 μm day-1) (p < 0.05) and higher survival (68 and 
32% respectively). 
Experiment 5
Three different algal species (the diatom Navicula sp., U. lens  and S. durum ) were tested against 
formulated feed (nursery powder; Adam & Amos). Animals were 1.3 mm in shell length at the 
start of the experiment. The growth rates were significantly lower on S. durum compared to 
the other two algal species and the formulated food during the first month of the experiment 
(p < 0.05). Fewer animals survived when feeding on artificial food. During the second month 
animals feeding on the two algal species Navicula sp. and U. lens  showed significantly higher 
growth-rates than animals feeding on S. durum and formulated food. (p < 0.05). The survival 
at the end of the trial was highest in treatment with U. lens  and lowest on S. durum . 
Experiment 6
In this experiment larger juvenile were fed with a formulated feed in comparison to U. lens . 
Juveniles averaged 3.2 mm in shell length at the start of the experiment. There was a significant 
difference in the first month. Juveniles grow better on U. lens with an average of 46 ± 2 μm 
day-1 compared to 32 ± 4 μm day-1 on artificial food (p < 0.05). No significant difference was 
found during the second month (p > 0.05). Both treatments sustained high survival rates (Table 
7: Exp. 6). Both growth and survival of juveniles feeding on formulated feed was higher in this 
experiment compared to the previous experiment were smaller juveniles were tested.
Experiment 7
Growth-rates of post-larvae were significantly lower on U. lens  compared to any other 
treatment combination (p < 0.05). Growth and survival rates were highest on the combination 
of the two diatoms Cocconeis sp. and Amphora sp. 
Experiment 8
Post-larvae averaged 489 μm in shell length at the start of the experiment and reached 
2,280 μm in shell length after 8 weeks in the combined diet treatment (Table 7: Exp. 8). During 
the first month there was no significant difference in growth between the treatments (p > 0.05). 
However post-larvae survived best on the combination diet. Significantly higher growth and 
survival occurred on the combination diet during the second month (p < 0.05). Post-larvae 
survived best on the combination diet followed by U. lens . The survival was poor on Navicula sp.
Experiment 9, 10
At the start of experiment 9 and 10 dead animals were replaced with post-larvae of similar size 
and feed history. In addition, a new treatment was added at the start of experiment 9 (Table 7: 
Exp. 9,10). The combination diet of U. lens  and Navicula sp. was tested against monospecific 
diets ( U. lens,  Navicula sp. and Cylindrotheca closterium ). 
In experiment 9 post-larvae feeding on the combination diet showed higher growth-rates 
than on Navicula sp. and C. closterium  during the first month and higher than on U. lens and 
C. closterium  during the second month but these differences were not significant (p > 0.05). In 
experiment 10, when juveniles were about 6-7 mm in shell length, growth-rates were low in 
all treatments during the first month and increased on the combination diet and U. lens  in the 
second month. However, overall survival on the combination diet in experiment 10 was poor. 34                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        35Experiment 11
No significant difference was found between the growth rates of post-larvae provided with 
U. lens at different percentage cover (p > 0.05). Post-larvae however survived best on the 
highest cover of U. lens.  
3.3.2  Growth experiments with Haliotis laevigata
Experiment 1
This trial was conducted over a two-month period to compare the growth and survival on 
the two different Navicula spp. The growth-rate and survival was higher on the larger size 
Navicula sp. however the differences were not significant (Table 7: Exp. 1; p > 0.05).
Experiment 2
The diatom Navicula sp., a combination of the two species Navicula sp. and Cylindrotheca 
closterium , the macroalga U. lens  and a U. lens and Navicula sp. combination were compared 
in a two month growth-trial. Growth rates were highest on the combination of the two diatom 
species Navicula sp. and Cylindrotheca closterium  throughout the trial (Table 7: Exp. 2). 
However the difference was only statistically significant during the second month (p < 0.05). 
Survival was highest on the U. lens and Navicula sp. combination throughout the trial 
(p < 0.05).
3.3.3  Growth experiment with hybrids ( Haliotis rubra  x H. laevigata  )
Experiment 1
The diatom Cocconeis  sp., a combination of the two species Cocconeis  sp. and Navicula 
sp., the macroalga U. lens  and a U. lens and Navicula sp. combination were compared in a 
one month growth-trial (Table 7). The growth-rate was significantly higher on the Cocconeis  
sp. and Navicula sp. combination compared to any other treatment (p < 0.05). Survival was 
highest on the macroalga U. lens (p < 0.05).
3.4 Discussion 
Kawamura et al. (1998a) suggested that nutrition from yolk reserves are still present in recently 
settled post-larvae and for that reason differences between feed species cannot be detected 
during the first 2 weeks post-settlement. Alternatively, the development of the digestive system 
is not completed and post-larvae lack the capability to fully utilise the different feeds (Roberts 
et al., 1999). In experiment 3, during the first week of rearing, there was no significant 
difference in growth between post-larvae feeding on five algal species. It is conceivable that 
after 1-2 weeks the yolk reserves are exhausted and differences between feed species then 
became apparent.
In our study post-larvae of the abalone H. rubra were 0.7-0.8 mm in shell length when 
differences between diatom species became apparent. Similarly, post-larvae of the abalone 
H. iris were 0.8-1 mm in shell length when differences were detected (Kawamura et al., 
1998a). These researchers suggested that dietary benefits that relate to diatom feed species 
depend on the size of the abalone.36                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        37Kawamura et al. (1995) found that some diatom species are ingested more easily because of 
their cell size or lower attachment strength. It is unlikely that the observed differences between 
diatom diets in this study are related to size because all diatoms tested were small (< 17 μm in 
length, < 4 μm in width). The mouth is 30 μm in diameter just 2 days after settlement (Seki & 
Kan-no, 1981). In addition, diatom cells of all but one species were found in faecal samples 
right from the beginning of the experiment. 
Martinez-Ponce and Searcy-Bernal (1998) reported that grazing rates increase rapidly during 
the first month of rearing. Similarly, in our experiment, feeding had to be more frequent 
towards the end of the experiment to maintain a high cell density in the dishes. This indicates 
that more biomass is needed to maintain rapid growth of the post-larvae. The Cocconeis sp., 
which was smaller in diameter at the end of the experiment, might be less suitable as a food 
source for older post-larvae because not enough biomass can be provided with this species. 
Most of the nutrition for post-larvae during the first 2-3 weeks after settlement must be 
derived from the biofilm components such as extracellular material produced by the diatoms 
and associated bacteria, as cells were not digested and remained alive in faecal samples. It has 
been suggested that extracellular polysaccharides produced by diatoms are responsible for the 
attachment of the cells (Hoagland et al., 1993) and well-attached Navicula sp. produced the 
largest post-larvae with the highest survival.
In experiment 3 we showed that the macroalgae U. lens  and S. durum  are not sufficient for 
the initial growth of H. rubra  post-larvae. The growth rates of post-larvae feeding on U. lens  
or S. durum  were significantly lower than on any diatom species throughout the experiment. 
Similarly, Seki (1997) reported that U. lens  produced slower growth of the abalone H. discus 
hannai than U. lens  with an additional diatom film of C. closterium . Similarly, we showed 
in experiment 7 that growth-rates were higher on the U. lens  and Navicula sp. combination 
compared to U. lens  alone. However, growth rates were highest on diatoms only during the 
first month of post-larval development. Growth rates of post-larvae feeding on U. lens  alone 
were very low during the first month of development (Experiment 3, 7) and were similar once 
juveniles reached about 1-2 mm in shell length (see experiment 5 and 8-9). The survival of 
juveniles growing on U. lens was high except for Experiment 3 and 5. These results warrant 
large-scale trials in the nursery to investigate the suitability of U. lens and cultured diatoms to 
enhance growth and survival and different stages of juvenile development (see Chapter 5).
Experiment 5 showed that formulated food (nursery powder; Adam & Amos) is not suitable 
for post-larvae smaller than 2 mm in shell length. Growth-rates were higher when juveniles 
reached ca. 3 mm in shell length (Experiment 6) indicating a potential for early weaning. For 
further details see large-scale trial in Chapter 5. However, growth rates with 3.2 mm juveniles 
were much lower than for even smaller animals on a range of different algal diets (Experiment 9).
Similar to H. rubra, growth rates of H. laevigata post-larvae feeding on U. lens  were lower 
than on any diatom species tested. They were also lower on a combined diet of U. lens and 
Navicula sp. as well as a mixed diatom diet. However the only significant difference was 
found during the second month when post-larvae grew best on the combined diet of Navicula 
sp. and Cylindrotheca closterium . These results indicate that H. laevigata post-larvae do not 
show a strong preference for any of the species and may benefit from a mixed species diet. 
The experiment conducted with hybrid post-larvae showed similar results to H. laevigata 
post-larvae with a mixed diatom diet ( Cocconeis sp., Navicula sp.) showing the best results in 
growth rate.36                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        373.5 References

4.1 Aim
The aim of this part of the study has been to identify suitable microalgae which can be easily 
used in abalone nursery, in terms of maintaining mass cultures, ability to colonise settlement 
surfaces and recolonise surfaces post grazing.
4.2 Introduction
Preliminary laboratory experiments and nursery trials were conducted to identify the suitable 
diatom species, size of the inoculum, nutrient level and time of incubation in static seawater 
(Table 9; June 1999). Only Navicula  sp. developed on vertical settlement plates. Other diatom 
species tested did not attach well to the plates ( Cylindrotheca closterium ) or did not develop a 
dense biofilm during the experimental period of 1-2 weeks ( Cocconeis  sp.). Therefore Navicula  
sp. was used for all large-scale inoculations. In addition, post-larvae feeding on Navicula  sp. 
showed the highest growth-rates (see Chapter 3). Experiments were run at two different farms 
in Victoria and at one farm in South Australia (Table 9).
Laboratory experiments have shown that the macroalgae U. lens is a suitable settlement inducer 
for larvae of the abalone Haliotis rubra (see Chapter 2) . However, the settlement rate of abalone 
larvae on U. lens appears to be reduced if the surface had previously been inoculated with a 
diatom species. In contrast, inoculation with the diatom Navicula  sp. enhanced the growth of 
post-larvae (see Chapter 3). Consequently methods were developed for a succession of algal 
species (initial development of U. lens for settlement followed by inoculation of Navicula  sp. 
for post-larval growth). In addition, plates with recently settled larvae were inoculated with no 
ill effect on the post-larvae (Table 9, October/November 2000).
4.3 Developed methods for algal culture and inoculation
4.3.1  Large scale algal sterilization and nutrient addition
Tanks and plates were scrubbed clean, filled with 1 μm filtered seawater and chlorinated at 
10-ppm overnight (160 mL 2,000 L-1). 2M Sodium thiosulphate and heavy aeration was 
used for dechlorination for 4 hours (50 ml 2,000 L-1). Nutrients were prepared as f2 (Guillard 
& Ryther, 1962): Nitrate (NaNO3) 150g 2,000 L-1; Phosphate (NaH2PO4) 10g 2,000 L-1; 
Ironcitrate as Fe (III) citrate trihydrate + Citric acid 9g 2,000 L-1 each (was dissolved in 1L 
before adding into the tank) and Metasilicate as Na2SiO3 23 g 2,000 L-1 (only for diatom 
inoculation). Alternatively a complete f-mix was sometimes used and applied at 40g 1,000 L-1 
(Microalgae Food, Manutech, Port Lincoln). All nutrients were dissolved before adding them 
to the tanks. The tanks remained static with low aeration. 38                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        39Table 9.

4.3.1.1  Ulvella lens  seeding
Seed plates with large mature patches of U. lens and well-developed sporangia were selected, 
wiped clean with a sponge to remove the diatom film and stored in a dark container or under 
double shading cloth, in 1 μm filtered seawater. One U. lens  seed plate was placed between 
each pair of baskets (8 seed plates per 2,000 L tank). The tanks remained static with low 
aeration and without shading. The release of zoospores was triggered by the increase in 
water temperature and light. The spore release started at sunrise. The largest release occurred 
4-5 days after the introduction of seed plates. The seed plates were removed after a mass 
release of zoospores.
4.3.1.2  Diatom inoculation
The diatom Navicula sp. was cultured on increasing larger, horizontally laid, algal bags up 
to commercial size bags of ca. 1 x 2 m. Three to four steps were required in this scaling 
up process. The diatom culture was harvested during the exponential phase (4-6 days after 
inoculation) and mixed into suspension. The diatom density was determined before tanks were 
inoculated. A 12 L inoculum (105-106 cells mL-1) was used in 2,000 L tanks. Within 24 hours 
the diatoms attached and continued to divide. The tanks were allowed to remain static for at 
least 48 hours; tanks with post-larvae receive low water flow with light aeration for 2-3 days.40                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        414.3.1.3  Extra plates to reduce juvenile density or supplement feeding by inoculation
A larger inoculum of 20-25 L 2,000 L-1 tanks was used to obtain higher diatom densities on 
the plates and tanks. Tanks remained static with light aeration for 3 days. Diatom density on 
the plates reached 104 cells cm-2 after 2 days and increased to 105 cells cm-2 after 4-5 days. The 
diatom density was then be manipulated by shading. Plates remained conditioned (with high 
diatom density) for at least 1 month under high grazing pressure.

5.1 Introduction and aims
Laboratory experiments have shown that the macroalgae Ulvella lens is a suitable settlement 
inducer for larvae of H. rubra  and H. laevigata (Chapter 2) . We achieved high settlement with 
U. lens of different age and developmental stages. Settlement was significantly lower on plates 
with biofilms dominated by diatoms. Settlement was higher on older compared to younger 
thalli of U. lens  and biofilms but settlement on U. lens appears to be reduced when previously 
inoculated with a diatom species. However inoculation with diatoms has some advantages for 
the subsequent growth of the post-larvae (Chapter 3). During the first two months of rearing 
growth-rates reached 30-40 µm day-1 when feeding on the cultured diatom Navicula  sp. When 
single species diets were compared to a combination of the macroalga U. lens  and the diatom 
Navicula  sp., growth-rates reached 42 µm day-1 on the combined diet but only 35 µm day-1 on 
single species diets. Survival up to 2 months post settlement was highest on the combination 
(70%) and lowest on the diatom only. 
The objectives of the following commercial scale experiments (Table 10) were to test:
1. If the technology from the laboratory can be transferred into the nursery; and
2. whether the results would be similar in commercial scale experiments. 
The aims for individual experiments are given in Table 10.
5.2 Methods
All commercial scale experiments are listed in Table 10. The experiment number, the duration, 
location, species and the aims of the experiment are presented.

5.2.1.1  Experimental design
An overview of the experimental design is given in Figure 13. Initially, four combinations of 
two larval densities and two developmental stages of U. lens were evaluated for abalone larval 
settlement. Subsequently, after settlement, all plates were systematically redistributed across 
the tanks and these four combinations were all subjected to inoculation with the cultured 
benthic diatom Navicula sp. or natural colonization with a mix of diatom species and the 
growth and survival of the abalone were measured.
5.2.1.2  Preparation of tanks
Each of 4 tanks (2,000 L) was divided into two parts with a separate inlet and outlet 
(= 8 tanks). The arrangements of tanks in the nursery can be seen in Figure 14. All 8 tanks 
contain 4 baskets with 14 plates each (Figure 13, Table 11). Airlines were installed along each 
side of the baskets (4 airlines per tank).42                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        43Table 10.

A removable platelet (12 cm x 17 cm) was bolted to the centre of sample plates in each basket 
prior to seeding and inoculation. At the time of settlement 2 sample plates, of each treatment 
in each basket (= 4, ∑ 128), received a platelet. Platelets are used to monitor algal species, 
density and cover as well as the settlement and growth of post-larvae. 55
 
Figure 14.   Diagram of tank arrangement in the nursery. Each of 8 tanks was set up with a central 
outlet (circle) and 14 plates in each of 4 baskets. A spray bar was arranged above two 
tanks (grey lines, with arrows). The plates were arranged in groups of 3 (old and young 
U. lens , dotted and continuous line respectively), with 2 edge plates (thick black line) on 
the side of each of the basket.
One plate of the same treatment was placed on each side of each of the sample plate 
(Table 11). In addition two extra plates were used to reduce the edge effect in each basket. 
The two plates were placed at either end of the basket (Table 11).

5.2.1.4  Larval settlement
Larvae were released into each tank at different densities (Figure 13, Table 11) and left with 
low water flow (1% exchange rate per hour) and low aeration for 48 hours. Banjo sieves 
(118 μm) were fitted onto each standpipe for the time of settlement to prevent the escape of 
larvae. Platelets were removed after 4 days to estimate the percentage settlement of larvae, to 
monitor algal density and to estimate the cover of Ulvella lens at settlement. Platelets were 
kept submerged at all times and replaced immediately after measurements. Settled larvae were 
counted in 6 small squares (2 x 2 cm) on each platelet (32 per treatment), the number was 
averaged and the total per settlement plate and tank was estimated. 
5.2.1.5  Post-larval growth and survival
After settlement plates were randomized, each basket in each tank received 3 plates of each 
treatment combination and 1 plate on each side of the basket to minimize the edge effect 
(Figure 14, Table 12, 13). The seawater flow was increased to 12 % exchange rate per hour 
and run for 1 week.  Nutrients were added to all tanks 1 week after settlement. Four of the 
eight tanks will be inoculated with the larger species of Navicula sp. (see chapter 4). Counts 
and measurements of post-larvae/ juveniles as well as presence and absence of algal species, 
estimates of algal species density and cover were undertaken every two weeks. 
5.2.1.6  Growth on platelet 
The growth of post-larvae was followed for 10 weeks. Four of the 8 tanks were inoculated with 
a supplement of cultured diatoms ( Navicula  sp.) ca. 2, 4 and 8 weeks after settlement. All tanks 
received 40 g of Manutec Microalgae Food 1,000 L-1 immediately before inoculation. Water 
was filtered at 1 μm during the first 8 weeks and at 5 μm until the end of the trial. 
5.2.1.7  Growth and survival on the plate
Animals were observed to move off the platelets 3-4 weeks after settlement. Consequently 
the growth and survival of juveniles was also monitored on whole plates 22, 64, 94 and 114 46                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        47days after settlement. New plates colonised by U. lens and inoculated with the cultured diatom 
Navicula sp. were introduced after 64 days to provide extra food and to reduce the juvenile 
density. Survival here describes the minimum survival on the plates without accounting for 
juveniles that have moved off the plates onto the tank wall or bottom and are still alive. Thus 
survival is likely to be underestimated.
5.2.1.8  Grading of juveniles
A sub sample of animals was graded 64 days after settlement. Two cohorts, 2.2 ± 0.11 mm 
and 3.1 ± 0.07 mm in shell length, were placed on new plates ( Ulvella lens  + Navicula  sp.) at 
a low density of less than 50 juveniles per plate. The growth was followed for an additional 
3 months (up to 141 days after settlement) to establish if the size frequency distribution of 
the two cohorts changes over time and whether smaller animals reach the size of larger ones 
providing the food is not limiting. Juveniles were measured and counted 94 and 114 days after 
settlement. 
5.2.1.9  Light measurements
The greenhouse where the tanks were located had clear plastic walls and roof with a vent 
along one side of the greenhouse. A 70% shade cloth was covering the roof but not the vent. 
The vent was open for most of the experimental trial and light measurement were taken to 
confirm the visual difference in light intensity across the tanks.  The light intensity in and outside 
each tank was measured with a Kahlsico Irradiameter Model 268-WA-310. Measurements 
(µw cm-2) were taken on two average days (1 overcast 21/02/01, 1 sunny 22/02/01), three 
times a day (9 am, 12 am, 3 pm). The greenhouse were the tanks are located has clear plastic 
walls and a 70% shade cloth was covering the plastic roof. Each time the light was measured 
at the top and bottom of the tank, without a shading cloth and with 1 and 2 covers (1 cloth = 
70% shading). Measurements of tanks top and bottom and over the whole day (3 times) were 
averaged. The appropriate measurements e.g. level of shading and weather condition (sunny 
or overcast), were chosen for analysis of covariance.

This experiment with greenlip larvae was run concurrently with the blacklip trial. Animals 
were spawned on the same day. Larvae were reared at the same ambient temperature and were 
released into the tank on the same day than the blacklip larvae.
5.2.2.1  Preparation of tanks and plates 
Two 2000 L tanks were set up with 8 baskets each. Two treatments were tested: 4-day young 
patches and 38-day-old Ulvella lens . Two sample plates of each treatment in each basket 
received a platelet (see above) . One plate of the same treatment was placed on each side of the 
sample plate. Two plates, one at each end of the basket, were used to reduce an edge effect. 
For algal culture methods see chapter 4.46                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        475.2.2.2  Larval settlement
200,000 larvae were released into each of the two tanks and left with very low water flow and 
low aeration for 48 hours. Banjo sieves (118 µm) were fitted onto each standpipe for the time 
of settlement to prevent the escape of larvae. Platelets were removed after 3 days to estimate 
the percentage settlement of larvae, to monitor algal density and to estimate the cover of 
Ulvella lens at settlement. Platelets were kept submerged at all times and replaced immediately 
after measurements. Settled larvae were counted in 6 small squares (2 x 2 cm) on each platelet 
(x 24 per treatment), the number was averaged and the total per settlement plate and tank was 
estimated. 
5.2.2.3  Growth and survival
The growth of post-larvae was followed for 10 weeks. Both tanks were inoculated with of 
cultured diatoms ( Navicula  sp.) as a feed supplement ca. 1, 4 and 8 weeks after settlement. 
Both tanks received the same dose of nutrients immediately before inoculation (40 g Manutec 
Microalgae Food 1,000 L-1).  Water was filtered at 1 μm during the first 8 weeks and at 5 μm 
until the end of the trial. Survival here describes the minimum survival on the plates without 
accounting for juveniles that have moved off the plates onto the tank wall or bottom and are 
still alive. Thus survival is likely to be underestimated.
5.2.3  Experiment 3: Light management (shading vs. no shading) to improve the 
growth and survival of H. rubra  post-larvae

5.2.3.1  Tank preparation
One 6,000 L tank was divided into 8 sections with separate in- and outlet (= 8 tanks). Each 
tank was set up with 3 baskets. Two airlines were installed, one on each side of the baskets. 
All plates (20 per basket) were inoculated with Ulvella lens  for 2 weeks before larval 
settlement. Larvae were released into each section at the same density (38,000 per section). 
All tanks remained static with low aeration for 3 days.
For algal culture methods see chapter 4.
5.2.3.2  Growth and survival
The growth of post-larvae was followed for 13 weeks. Tanks were inoculated with the cultured 
diatom  Navicula sp. 1, 4 and 8 weeks after settlement. Throughout the trial four of the eight 
tanks were shaded (shade) with double shading cloth, four tanks were kept unshaded (light). 
Survival here describes the minimum survival on the plates without accounting for juveniles 
that have moved off the plates onto the tank wall or bottom and are still alive. Thus survival 
is likely to be underestimated.
5.2.3.3  Light measurements
The light intensity in and outside each tank was measured with a Kahlsico Irradiameter Model 
268-WA-310. Measurements (µw cm-2) were taken on the 04/04/2001 at 12 pm.

The light was measured at the top and bottom of each 
tank, half of the tanks were shaded with 1 shading cloth (1 cloth = 70% shading) the other half 
was unshaded. Measurements of tanks top and bottom and were averaged. Light measurements 
were analysed in an analyses of covariance.

5.2.4.1  Preparation of tanks 
Three 490 L tanks were set up with 3 baskets each. Four treatments were tested: 4-day and 
38-day-old Ulvella lens  and the diatom species Cocconeis sp. and Navicula sp. Five plates of 
each treatment were alternated so that each tank received 15 plates of each treatment in total.
For algal culture methods see chapter 4.
5.2.4.2  Larval settlement
100,000 larvae were released into each tank and left with very low water flow and low aeration 
for 3 days. Banjo sieves (118 µm) were fitted onto each standpipe for the time of settlement 
to prevent the escape of larvae. The settlement rates of larvae were estimate on whole plates 
after 3 days. Plates were kept submerged in seawater during counts and replaced into tanks 
immediately after measurements. A grid with equal size squares was placed inside the tray and 
a stereomicroscope was mounted above the tray to view and assess the settled larvae.
The algal density and cover was monitored on sub samples of six plates per tank at the time 
of settlement.

5.2.5.1  Preparation of tanks
Three 490 L tanks were set up with 3 baskets and 20 settlement plates in each. Airlines were 
installed along each side and through the middle of the baskets (3 airlines per tank).  Plates 
were conditioned with Ulvella lens  7 days before larval settlement and then inoculated with 
10 L of cultured Navicula sp. per tank, 4 days before settlement. 48                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        495.2.5.2  Larval settlement
100,000 larvae were released into each tank and left with very low water flow and low aeration 
for 3 days. Banjo sieves (118 μm) were fitted onto each standpipe for the time of settlement 
to prevent the escape of larvae. The settlement rates of larvae were estimate on whole plates 
after 3 days (see Exp. 4).
5.2.5.3  Growth and survival
Tanks were inoculated with 10 L of Navicula sp. culture, 30 days after larval settlement and 
every 2 weeks thereafter until the end of the trial. Juveniles (< 3 mm in shell length) were reared 
on a combined diet of Ulvella lens  and diatoms. Counts and measurements of algal species, 
density and cover as well as growth rate of the abalone were undertaken at approximately two-
week intervals. Survival here describes the minimum survival on the plates without accounting 
for juveniles that have moved off the plates onto the tank wall or bottom and are still alive. 
Thus survival is likely to be underestimated.
5.2.5.4  Early weaning
After 10 weeks, when juveniles were > 3 mm in shell length in the proceeding trial, all animals 
were taken off the plates. Three experimental raceways (1,000 mm x 300 mm) were set up 
with a fixed stocking density of 2,500 animals (75% cover). Abalone were weighed and fed 
24 hours later. Animals were fed to excess with a commercial weaner diet at 1% of their body 
weight every day for the duration of the trial.  All tanks had separate inlets and outlets. Six 
490 L tanks were set up with new plates (3 tanks with U. lens  and 3 tanks with Navicula sp. 
plates). The abalone were placed onto one horizontal settlement plate on top of each basket and 
left for 24 hours allowing them to reattach before turning the plates vertically into the tanks.  
Animals were maintained on natural food and stocked at ca. 50 animals per plates (ca. 3,000 
per tank). 
Growth-rates of abalone were determined by measuring the size of 72 juveniles per tank 
or raceway every 2 weeks. The numbers of juveniles per plate and per tank/raceway were 
estimated in all treatments. After 10 weeks, when the natural food became limiting, animals 
were taken off the old plates and moved onto a new set of plates (both treatments). The trial was 
terminated in week 26 when animals reached 10 mm in shell length in one of the treatments.
5.2.5.5  Data analyses for all experiments
Statistical analyses were carried out using the STATISTICA computer package. Assumption 
of normality and homogeneity of variance were checked graphically for each data set 
using boxplots (means vs. variances, residuals vs. means). Numbers of settled larvae (not 
percentages) were analysed. Substrata were not independent at settlement in experiments 1, 
2 and 4. Consequently, data from these experiments were analysed using paired t-tests. Total 
settlement rates per tank were analysed using a two-way ANOV A (experiment 1 and 4). 
Shell length or growth-rates of post-larvae of each measurement was analysed separately as a 
one-way ANOV A (Experiment 2, 3, 5). The size of the post-larvae at 10, 22, 38 and 52 days 
after settlement in experiment 1 was corrected for the light gradient between tanks using a 
regression. The residuals of these regression and the daily mortality rate between 0-22 and 
22-64 days were analysed using a 2-way ANCOV A, with U. lens  and diatom treatment 
as factors (Experiment 1). Tank was used as an additional factor nested within the diatom 50                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        51treatment. The initial count of post-larvae on the plates was used as covariate to account for 
the difference in number of post-larvae on the plate at settlement (Experiment 1).  U. lens  cover 
and diatom densities were analysed in a two-way ANCOV A using and light intensity as a 
covariate with repeated measures (Experiment 1). The average proportion of light transmitted 
in each treatment in Experiment 3 was compared with a t-test.
5.3 Results 
5.3.1  Experiment 1: The effect of cultured algae and larval density on settlement 
and early growth of the abalone Haliotis rubra
5.3.1.1  Settlement
An average of 62% of the larvae release into the tanks settled successfully (Table 14). The 
higher density of larvae (100,000 per tank) resulted in 54% settlement with an estimate of ca. 
1,133 larvae per plate. In the lower density tanks (50,000 per tank) an average of 70% settled 
which equalled ca. 739 larvae per plate.
Out of the 62% larvae settled, an average of 38% chose to settle on the plates covered with 
older patches of Ulvella lens  (33% in high density tanks, 44% in low density tanks) whereas 
24% were estimated on the younger U. lens (21% in high density tanks, 26% in low density 
tanks). Therefore significantly more larvae settled on the older compared to the younger 
U. lens  (paired t = 3.14, df = 7, p = 0.016). A parallel trial running in the laboratory supported 
this result but gave a lower overall settlement rate (see Chapter 2; Table 1, Exp. 12). There 
was a significant negative correlation between the number of larvae settled and the % cover of 
U. lens (ß = -0.80, p < 0.05) but no significant correlation between the number of larvae settled 
and the diatom counts (ß = -0.58, p > 0.05).

5.3.1.2  Growth and survival on the platelets
Post-larvae of all treatments reached 2 mm in shell length 52 days after settlement (Table 15). 
The highest growth-rate was measured on old U. lens platelets with a low density of larvae, 
inoculated with the cultured diatom Navicula  sp. (Table 15). These platelets showed the 
highest density of diatoms (Table 16). 50                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        51Table 15.

The size of the post-larvae was significantly affected by the light gradient in the hatchery 
(Average size at 52 days ( μm) = 932.8 + 108.8 Light ( μW cm-2), R2 = 0.23, F1,122= 35.7, p < 0.001).
There was a highly significant impact of initial density on the growth of the post-larvae 
(ANCOV A, F = 48.3, df = 1, p < 0.001), a significant difference in the size of post-larvae 
growing on old and young U. lens (F = 7.23, df = 1, p < 0.05) and significant differences 
between tanks inoculated with diatom and the others (F = 6.92, df = 6, p < 0.05).

Early growth between 0 and 10 days after settlement was even across treatment and remained 
between 36 and 40 µm day-1 (Table 15). Growth rates then decreased significantly until 
22 days after settlement after which they increased again. Growth rates then remained over 
40 µm day-1 in all treatments. During the initial 52 days, growth was generally higher on old 
U. lens  plates (Table 15). 
Across all treatments, 52 days after settlement, post-larvae in tanks closest to a vent (Tank 
D 1,2) were larger than post larvae in tanks furthest away from the vent (Table 17). The 
difference was more pronounced in tanks inoculated with Navicula sp. Platelets with Navicula 
sp. in tanks closest to the vent supported a higher diatom density than those in tanks furthest 
away from the vent (Table 18). The smallest difference occurred between the 4 tanks furthest 
away from the vent (Tanks A1-2, B1-2). 52                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        53Table 17.

5.3.1.3  Growth and survival on the plate 
Across all treatments post-larvae on plates (1,082 ± 14.79 µm) were on average slightly larger 
than those on platelets (1,001 ± 6.10 µm) 22 days after settlement but the estimated number 
of post-larvae per plate were slightly lower on whole plate than on platelet (354 ± 56.58 
and 403 ± 42.73 respectively). However, none of the differences were significant (ANOV A, 
p > 0.05). Post-larvae were observed to move off the platelets 4-5 weeks after settlement 
and consequently measurements were measured on whole plates. Growth-rates on the plates 
averaged 37 µm day-1 up to 22 days after settlement and 41 µm day-1 between 22 and 64 days 
after settlement (Table 19).

We estimated 22% survival across all treatments 64 days after settlement. No significant 
difference in survival was found between the treatments (p > 0.05). 
Juveniles reached 7 mm in shell length 114 days after settlement (Table 20). There was a 
significant difference between juveniles growing on old and young U. lens  (p < 0.001), low and 
high densities of larvae (p < 0.05) and a significant U. lens and density interaction (p < 0.001).
Juveniles on old U. lens  with a  high original larval density were significantly smaller than 
juveniles in all other treatment combinations (p < 0.001, post-hoc). The highest growth-rates 
were measured 94 days after settlement, after new plates had been introduced into the tanks 
and the number of juveniles was reduced to 160 animals per plate (Table 20). 
5.3.1.4  Grading of smallest and largest juveniles
At the end of the trial the small cohort of the juveniles (2.2 ± 0.11 mm at the start) reached 
9.8 mm (± 0.09) in shell length whereas the larger cohort (3.1 ± 0.07 mm at the start) averaged 
10.9 mm (± 0.12) in shell length. The difference between the population means increased to 
1.4 mm 93 days after settlement and to 1.8 mm 113 days after settlement (Figure 15).

settlement, growth and survival of H. laevigata post-larvae
5.3.2.1  Settlement
An average of 26% of the released greenlip larvae (200,000 per tank) settled successfully 
(Table 22). There was no significant difference in larval settlement between old (38 days) and 
young (4 days) U. lens plates (p > 0.05). However, an average of 417 larvae per plate settled 
successfully on older plates, whereby ca. 310 larvae were estimated on each younger plate of 
U. lens  (Table 22).54                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        55Table 22.

5.3.2.2  Growth and survival
Post-larvae averaged 2.7 mm in shell length 66 days after settlement (Table 23). Growth-rates 
were low between 9 and 21 days post settlement. Greenlips only reached ca. 0.7 mm in shell 
length 21 days after settlement. At the end of the experiment growth-rates were significantly 
higher on older compared to younger plates of U. lens (p < 0.05).

On average we estimated 61 juveniles per plate at the end of the experiment. There was no 
difference between the treatments (p > 0.05). Consequently plates in the greenlip trial did not 
need to be split at the end of the experiment. More juveniles survived on younger than on older 
plates of U. lens  throughout the trial (Table 24), settlement however was higher on older than 
on younger plates (Table 22, see above).

5.3.2.3  Algal density and cover
The percentage cover of U. lens was higher in younger compared to older plates throughout 
the trial (Table 25). The cover increased in both treatments as the experiment progressed. 
Significant numbers of diatom cells were only found at the start of the experiment (10 days 
after settlement). A higher density of diatom cells were found on the older plates which 
coincided with lower % cover of U. lens . 56                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        57Table 25.

Post-larvae reached 2.85 mm in shell length in the unshaded tanks and 2.20 mm in the shaded 
tanks 84 days after settlement (Figure 17). Post-larvae were significantly larger in unshaded 
tanks at the end of the experiment (p < 0.05). The growth-rates were low in April, 33-61 
days after settlement and increased in May when juveniles reached 1.5 mm in shell length 
(Table 26). During April and May the water temperatures did not exceed 16º C. There was no 
significant difference in survival between the treatments (p > 0.05). Up to 70% of the post-
larvae survived the first 3 weeks and 35% were still present at the end of the experiment.

The proportion of light transmitted was significantly lower in the shaded (1.9 ± 0.2%) than in 
the unshaded tanks (8.7 ± 1.8 %) (t = 3.6, df = 7, p < 0.01). The bottom of the plates received 
less light (5.2 ± 1.5%) than the top (12.2 ± 2.0%) in the light treatment (paired t = 3.04, df = 3,
p = 0.056). It was not the case in the shaded tanks where the proportion of light transmitted 
was similar between the top (1.6 ± 0.1%) and the bottom (2.2 ± 0.3%) of the tanks (paired 
t = 2.00, df = 3, p = 0.139).
5.3.3.3  Algal density and cover
The average cover of U. lens increased from ca. 55 to 75% in the shade treatment and from 68 
to 91% in the light treatment during the experimental period. U. lens cover was significantly 
affected by the light treatment (p < 0.001) (Figure 18). The cultured diatom Navicula  sp. 
dominated in unshaded tanks, however a species of Cocconeis sp. became dominant in shaded 
tanks towards the end of the experiment (Figure 18).

selected diatoms  ( Cocconeis sp. and Navicula sp.)
5.3.4.1  Settlement
The percentage of settled larvae in all treatments is displayed in Table 27. On average we 
estimated ca. 1,000 larvae on old U. lens , 233 on young U. lens , 83 on Cocconeis sp. and 
117 on Navicula  sp. Settlement was significantly higher on old U. lens  than on younger 
U. lens  (t = 7.19, p < 0.001) and higher than on the two diatom species (t = 8.67, p < 0.001). 
No significant difference was found between the two diatom species (t = 1.81, p = 0.07). 58                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        59There was a significant effect of tank and the position of plates in the tank (F = 3.70, p = 0.03; 
F = 8.69, p < 0.001 respectively). Settlement was higher in the tank closest to a clear Perspex 
wall (more light) compared to the tank furthest away from the wall (post-hoc p = 0.025). Plates 
closer to the outlet of the tank had higher settlement than plates in the middle or close to the 
other end of the tank (post-hoc p < 0.001).

early weaning onto formulated feed in comparison to live algae, on growth 
and survival of the juveniles
5.3.5.1  Settlement, growth and survival up to 4 mm in shell length
A settlement rate of 36% ± 7.9 was estimated 3 days after larvae release. No significant 
difference was found between tanks or the position of the plates in the tank (p > 0.05).
This initial growth trial was run from November 2001 to February 2002. The water temperature 
ranged between 17º C and 24º C; with an average of 20º C. Water temperatures were highest 
during the last 4 weeks of the trial.
Juveniles growing on a mixed diet of cultured algae ( Ulvella lens , Navicula sp.) reached 
2.9 mm in shell length about 9 weeks after settlement. Juveniles averaged 3.9 mm in size at the 
end of the trial (Table 28). The growth-rates were low during the first three days after larval 
release, averaged about 40 µm day-1 during the following 41 days but were very promising at 
69 µm day-1 during the last 4 weeks of the trial. Post-settlement survival was estimated at 46%, 
16 days after settlement, and this decreased to 27% at the end of the trial.

Ulvella lens  covered between 50 and 70% of the plates for most of the trial but around 
58 days after settlement the cover decreased substantially (Figure 19). Initially, Nitzschia sp. 
was the dominant species in the diatom assemblage on the plates. This species developed 
naturally on the plates. Tanks were first inoculated with the cultured diatom Navicula  sp. 
4 days before and than 30 days after settlement. 
The cell densities of Navicula  sp. increased 3.5 times and dominated the plates from 44 days 
until the end of the trial (Figure 19).

Juveniles feeding on U. lens  reached 10 mm in shell length in less than 15 weeks. Juveniles 
feeding on U. lens  were significantly larger at the end of the trial, than juveniles feeding on 
the diatom Navicula sp. or the formulated feed (p < 0.001). 
Growth rates were highest on U. lens and averaged 84 µm day-1 during the first 8 weeks and 
63 µm day-1 during the following weeks after new plates had been introduced (Table 29). 
The growth-rates of abalone juveniles increased when the % cover of the alga decreased

rate declined substantially possibly due to the handling stress. Growth-rates did not recover 
before the end of the trial. Juveniles survived best on U. lens  followed by juveniles feeding on 
Navicula sp. Growth-rates were lowest on the formulated feed (Table 29).

decreased continuously until only 11 % of the plates were covered after 9 weeks (Table 30).

The cell density on the plates in the Navicula sp. treatment followed a similar trend. New 
plates were introduced after 9 weeks with even higher % cover in the U. lens  treatment and 
higher cell densities in the Navicula sp. treatment than at the start of the trial. Both U. lens  
cover and Navicula sp. cell density declined rapidly. 
5.4 Discussion 
5.4.1  Settlement
Settlement in commercial abalone farms in Australia is unreliable and usually yields a 5-10% 
settlement rate (pers. obs.). Settlement rates obtained during these experiments (up to 62%) 
are the highest recorded in commercial facilities in Australia suggesting that the settlement 
induction using plates conditioned with U. lens  was efficient. The level of settlement was close 
to those reported in studies on smaller scale (Chapter 2). The present study indicates that the 
conditioning techniques developed at smaller scale can be successfully transferred into the 
nursery and will greatly improve the reliability of settlement in commercial abalone farms. 62                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        63Initial larval density in the first experiment with blacklip larvae did not significantly affect 
settlement rates. This may be an artefact of our complex experiment design, which would have 
required more replication at the tank level. However, the observed lower settlement rate at 
high larval density (even though not statistically significant) may be the result of competition 
for suitable settlement substrate, as larvae are known to actively explore the substrate before 
attachment (Harvey & Bourget, 1997; Boxshall, 2000). 
In experiment 1, larvae showed a clear preference for the substrate on which they settled and 
older plates with a lower cover of U. lens  were preferred. U. lens  seems to provide a much 
better cue for settlement than diatom biofilm (Chapter 2); however, settlement was reduced 
when the cover was higher (Chapter 2, Table 1, Exp.12). In the first experiment significant 
more larvae settled on older compared to younger U. lens plates. The older plates supported 
lower % cover of U. lens  than the younger plates at the time of settlement. However in 
the greenlip experiment this difference was not significant. The statistical power may have 
been too low to detect any significant difference because fewer replicates were used in the 
greenlip experiment. However, even in small-scale experiments the difference between 
some U. lens treatments (above 25% cover) was not as pronounced in a greenlip experiment 
compared to a blacklip experiment (Chapter 2, Table 1) suggesting a less specific response in 
greenlip larvae. 
The developmental stage of U. lens rather than the actual cover might be important and older 
plants may provide a better or more pronounce cue for settlement. Alternatively, the associated 
biofilm, including diatoms bacteria and mucus might have been more attractive on older 
U. lens  when the cover of U. lens is lower.
In experiment 1 plates with younger thalli of U. lens showed a higher overall percentage cover 
because more spores originally attached and germinated on those plates. These plates had more 
but smaller individual patches of U. lens . Perhaps the smaller patches are less inductive than 
larger but fewer patches on older U. lens plates. In addition, at about 2-3 weeks of development 
sporangia are formed and these or associated mucus could have contributed to the higher 
settlement rate on older plates. Settlement of H. rubra had been observed on the sori and 
conceptacles of specific coralline red algae (S. Daume, unpublished observations).
The first experiment with blacklip larvae showed very high settlement on U. lens . Settlement 
of greenlips in parallel running trial was substantially lower. Similarly, in laboratory 
experiments, settlement rates of the greenlip larvae on U. lens  were much lower than rates 
of blacklip larvae (Chapter 2). Settlement substrates in both experiments were of similar age 
and percentage cover when tested. Differences in settlement response between the two species 
have been reported previously (Daume et al., 1999a) however differences in larval quality 
between the batches could have contributed. Experiment 4 and 5 were conducted with greenlip 
(H. laevigata ) larvae and the settlement rate especially in experiment 4 on older U. lens  was 
comparable to the first experiment with blacklip larvae indicating that batch differences may 
play a major role.
Experiment 4 and 5 clearly demonstrates, that U. lens is a suitable settlement inducer for 
greenlip larvae on a commercial scale. It also indicates, that larvae can distinguish between 
different developmental stages of the alga. As with larvae of the abalone H. rubra , settlement 
of greenlip larvae was higher on older compared to younger U. lens  (Experiment 4). In 
experiment 1 the cover of U. lens was lower on the older plates compared to the younger 
plates. In experiment 4 U. lens  covered the plates almost completely in both treatments (97% 62                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        63and 82% respectively). The overall settlement rate in experiment 5 was lower than on the older 
U. lens treatment but higher than in the younger U. lens treatment of experiment 4, possibly 
because the alga was not as developed (younger) and plates had a biofilm dominated by the 
diatom species Nitzschia sp. and Navicula sp. at the time of settlement. Settlement experiments 
in the laboratory showed that settlement was reduced if plates with U. lens  were previously 
inoculated with a diatom species (Chapter 2).  
5.4.2  Growth
Experiment 1 and 2 were conducted between November 2000 and April 2001, taking advantage 
of the high water temperatures over the summer months. Factors that are likely to play a major 
role in the popu lation dynamic of these early stages are competition, which is determined by 
the density of the animals and the food availability, which is dependent on the light because 
light controls the growth of the feed species. 
In experiment 1 we showed that the type of substrate on which the larvae settled influences 
the settlement densities; and density and light subsequently affected early growth. Because of 
the distribution of the tanks in the nursery, the tanks supporting the fastest initial growth with 
a lower settlement densities, received a higher light intensity, resulting in a denser diatom 
biofilm. This was supported by experiment 3 where animals in tanks without shading cloth 
were significantly larger than animals in tanks with double shading cloth. Other parameters 
such as temperature did not appear to vary between tanks as a result of the constant water flow. 
Our results suggest that animal density and light intensity had the greatest impact on early 
growth through effects on food availability. The higher diatom density may have provided 
the post-larvae with more extracellular mucus for their early growth. In addition, bacteria and 
mucus associated with older U. lens  plates may have played an important role in the early 
growth (Garland et al., 1985). Interestingly, this difference in early growth remained and 
was amplified until the end of the experiment, suggesting that early growth is important in 
determining later performances.
Early growth is thought to be affected by the lipid reserves of the larval yolk in the first two to 
three weeks after settlement (Kawamura & Takami, 1995; Roberts et al., 1999; Chapter 3). The 
absorption of the yolk reserves must have ended approximately 2 weeks after settlement and 
the growth decreased presumably as the post-larvae started feeding inefficiently on the diatoms 
(Kawamura et al., 1998). In this second phase, growth was best where the diatoms abundance 
was high and the associated intraspecific competition was low. When animals reached ca. 
2 mm in shell length the growth-rates improved substantially indicating that juveniles can fully 
access the feed provided. This is also the time when the first respiratory pore was formed (pers. 
obs.). In addition, we demonstrated in experiment 5 that juveniles started to remove parts of 
U. lens about 58 days after larval release, when they reached 3 mm in shell length, which 
was evident by a sharp decline in percentage cover of U. lens  and growth-rates increased 
substantially. The cell density of the cultured diatom Navicula sp. was low at the start of the 
trial, which could have contributed to the lower growth-rate at the earlier stages.  
The survival was higher in tanks inoculated with the cultured diatom than in tanks with mixed 
naturally developing species 22 days after settlement. At that time tanks had been recently 
inoculated and the cell density of Navicula sp. was higher in these treatments. Naturally 
developing diatoms (mixed species) might have been compromised because of the high 
filtration at the beginning of the trial. It was mainly on plates with low U. lens  cover that 64                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        65a high cell density could be maintained through the inoculation of cultured diatoms. This 
explains why the U. lens  treatment was more signifi cantly affecting growth than the diatom 
treatment. This emphasises the importance of space availability for the attachment of cells and 
the competitive advantage for the species colonising the space early. In experiment 5 it took 
about 1 month for the cultured, inoculated diatom Navicula sp. to out-compete the naturally 
developed diatom species Nitzschia sp., which was dominant at the start of the experiment. 
This demonstrates that the species composition of a biofilm can be altered by inoculation of 
a cultured diatom. However, if competitive species are present at the time of inoculation this 
process might take some time.
The use of new plates covered with a good diatom biofilm and U. lens  allowed efficient 
thinning of the juveniles, preventing handling stress and high labour costs. As a result, 
competition for space and food was reduced efficiently and growth improved significantly. 
Juvenile growth increased by 3 fold in a few days when the density was reduced to less 
than 50 juveniles per plate ca. 2 months after settlement. Hence introducing new plates have 
significant advantage. Our results also show the importance of the preparation of the substrate 
for nursery performance. Initial diatom cover had a positive impact on the growth even at later 
stages. Older U. lens  plates had a lower cover allowing more diatom cells to develop. When 
juveniles are large enough to move readily between plates, this technique should be preferred 
to diatom inoculation. However cohorts of graded animals became more variable in size as the 
experiment progressed indicating that some of the variability in growth may not be genetic. 
The grading at this stage did not improve the growth-rate of the juveniles, questioning the need 
of the labour intensive exercise in a commercial farm situation.
U. lens  was not affected as much by the light intensity as diatoms, indicating that light is not 
limiting for U. lens  in shaded tanks during the summer month. However, when tanks were 
shaded with two shading cloths in Experiment 3, which was run over the winter period, U. lens  
cover was reduced in the shaded tanks. In addition, the light treatment appeared to affect the 
algal community composition on the plates in this experiment even in the first 49 days. The 
dominant diatom species at 49 days after settlement were Navicula sp. and Cocconeis sp. in 
the unshaded tanks and it was Cocconeis sp. only in the shaded tanks. 
We successfully used shading to prevent the formation of filamentous, chain forming diatoms 
at the early phase of the experiment 1 and 2 without reducing the cover of U. lens . It is very 
important to maintain a low density of diatoms on the plates at the early stages of post-larval 
life because a thick film of fast growing diatoms can smother young animals.
Juvenile survival was higher on younger U. lens plates whereby settlement was higher on 
older plates indicating that juveniles prefer a different substrate for feeding than larvae do for 
settlement. Migration of the juveniles off the plates could have confounded the survival results 
in all experiment but could also indicate a less attractive grazing substrate. 
Comparing experiment 1 and 2, growth rates and shell length of juveniles were similar at 
the end of the two experiments. However greenlips grew much slower at the start of the 
experiment and growth rates were particularly low between 9 and 21 days post settlement. 
Survival was lower in the greenlip trial particularly on older than younger plates of U. lens 
plates. The diatom cell density was undetectable for most of the greenlip trial and is unlikely 
to have contributed to the observed difference in this case. 64                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        65Greenlips show higher optimal temperature requirements than blacklips (12-22° C and 
8-22° C respectively) (Gilroy & Edwards, 1998). At the start of the experiments the ambient 
water temperature was low (ca. 16° C) and post-larvae of the greenlips might have been 
compromised. The third experiment was conducted from February to May 2001 with blacklip 
abalone and growth rates were low throughout the trial particularly in the shaded treatment. 
Seawater temperatures never exceeded 16° C during the time of the experiment. The low 
growth rate in the third experiment may partially be explained by differences in batches, lower 
water temperature and or feed availability during the trial. 
We showed in chapter 3 that the green alga U. lens  is not sufficient for the initial growth of 
the abalone H. rubra . However, when animals reached ca. 2 mm in shell length the growth-
rates improved and were in some cases comparable to growth-rates of post-larvae feeding on 
diatoms. Experiment 5 clearly demonstrated that U. lens  is a suitable food source for juveniles 
> 3 mm. Juveniles started to remove parts of U. lens ca. 58 days after larval release (about 
3 mm in shell length), which was evident by a sharp decline in percentage cover of U. lens  and 
resulted in an increase in growth-rates. Juveniles feeding on U. lens  grow significantly faster 
and survived better than on the diatom Navicula sp. or the formulated feed. The formulated 
feed might not be well matched for the nutritional requirements of small juveniles and other 
formulae should be tried. The growth-rates of juveniles feeding on formulated feed improved 
towards the end of the trial indicating that the feed might be suitable for larger juveniles 
> 4 mm in shell length. Unless a suitable formulated feed is found, which can match growth-
rates achieved with the macroalga U. lens  we suggest keeping animals on plates colonised by 
U. lens as long as possible. 
The potential of diatoms as a food source for juvenile abalone might be underestimated in 
experiment 5 because cell densities were low at times. However, we regard U. lens as the 
preferred food species for juveniles >3 mm in shell length. As demonstrated, high growth-rates 
can be achieved a nd cultures of U. lens can be easily maintained  in the nursery. 
5.4.3  Recommendations for industry
We suggest that plates with a lo w cover of young germlings of U. lens could be used for high 
settlement induction and followed with an inoculation with Navicula sp. to ensure sufficient 
food for the growing post-larvae during the first 1-2 month of rearing. During summer, stipe 
(hair-like structures) production and mass spore release of U. lens  can cause high mortality of 
recently settled post-larvae if not properly managed (A. Krisinich pers. comm.). Over summer 
two shading cloths can be used to reduce the light intensity, which in turn reduces stipe 
production and spore release of U. lens  without compromising its growth. The shading will 
also inhibit growth of filamentous, chain forming diatoms, which can be detrimental during the 
early stages of the abalone post-larval life. Over the winter period older plates could be used 
to induce settlement because both stipe production and spore release is hindered through lower 
light intensity and water temperature. New plates colonised with cultured diatoms could be 
introduced into the tanks for the following 2 months of post-larval development. Alternatively, 
settlement plates with developing U. lens germlings leave adequate space on the plates for a 
cultured diatom film to develop. After 2 months U. lens  will provide sufficient food for the 
animals and plates can be re-seeded with spores or additional plates colonised with U. lens  can 
be added every month to ensure suff icient food for larger juveniles.66                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        675.5 References

6.1 Introduction and aim
Abalone, like other herbivores, grow under conditions leading potentially to nitrogen limitation 
(White, 1978; Mattson, 1980) because the ratio of nitrogen to fibre and carbohydrates is low in 
plants. Fleming (1995) found that nitrogen is a limiting nutrient for the growth of the abalone 
Haliotis rubra  when feeding on seaweeds, because the intake of digestible nitrogen directly 
influences their growth rates. Post-larval abalone are known to feed mainly on benthic diatoms 
(Kawamura et al., 1998) until animals reach 7 to 8 mm in shell length and switch to eating 
macroalgae (Hahn, 1989). In abalone nurseries diatoms are cultured on vertical PVC plates 
and fed to juveniles up ca 10-12 mm in shell length. Growth rates are therefore influenced 
by the availability, digestibility and nutritional composition of the diatoms, which can vary 
substantially between species, season, tanks and even plates (Kawamurra et al., 1998, Roberts 
et al., 1999, Daume et al., 2000). Once juveniles reach 12-15 mm in shell length they are 
transferred to a different growout system where they are fed formulated feed.
Previous research has shown that the biochemical composition of microalgae varies between 
species (Brown et al., 1996) and is greatly affected by harvest stage, light intensity (Thompson 
et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1996) and culture methods (Otero & Fábregas, 1997). 
Thus the biochemical composition of microalgae can be influenced by the nutrient concentration 
of the growth media (Fabregas et al. 1996, D`Souza & Kelly 2000) and in turn the animals fed 
on these algae may show changes in growth parameters (D`Souza and Kelly 2000).
There are a number of studies examining the changes in biochemical composition by changing 
the growing conditions of the algae (e.g. Otero and Fábregas, 1997, Thompson et al., 1993; 
Brown et al., 1996). However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of varied 
biochemical composition of the feed on the growth and survival of the animals (Fabregas et 
al. 1996, D`Souza and Kelly 2000).
The aim of these experiments was to determine the effect on biological performance (growth 
rate and survival) of juvenile abalone (1-3 mm in shell length) feeding on a single species 
of diatom grown under different nitrogen regimes. This size range of the animal was chosen 
because we established in previous experiments that post-larvae at this stage are able to ingest 
the diatom cells and most of their valves in faeces samples are broken. The content of cells is 
therefore considered to be available to the animal as a food source. 68                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        696.2 Methods
6.2.1  Experiment conducted at Southern Ocean Mariculture
6.2.1.1  Location
This experiment was conducted in May-June 2000 at Southern Ocean Mariculture (SOM), Port 
Fairy, Victoria, Australia. The farm provided the juvenile abalone ( Haliotis rubra ). Diatoms 
and juveniles were grown in an air-conditioned room at 17 ± 3 ° C with a 12 L: 12 D photo 
cycle. 
6.2.1.2  Algal culture
The diatom species Navicula sp. was cultured in f/2 medium with varying nitrogen levels. 
Three treatments were tested, high nitrogen = 24.71 mg NO3-N L-1, normal = 12.35 mg NO3-
N L-1 and low = 2.47 mg NO3-N L-1. Cultures were allowed to adjust for 2 weeks to the new 
nutrient levels. Cells were grown attached to the bottom of the petri dishes until they reached 
a density of approximately 1 x 105 cells cm-2. Four extra dishes of each treatment were set up 
for biochemical analysis and harvested at the end of the trial.
6.2.1.2  Juvenile culture
Larvae were settled in a commercial abalone farm (SOM) and grown until they reached ca. 
1 mm in shell length. Seven juveniles were placed into each of 3 replicated dishes of each of 
the three treatments (high, normal and low nitrogen). The media was replaced every 3-4 days 
with the respective, fresh sterilised media. The shell length of post-larvae was measured at 
the beginning of the experiment and every week of the four-week trial. Dead juveniles were 
replaced with animals of the same feeding history.
6.2.1.3  Sample preparation and amino acid analysis
Diatom samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analysed for amino acid 
composition. The amino acid composition of all of the 12 samples (3 treatments x 4 replicates) 
was analysed. Samples were filtered onto pre-weighed glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C, 
4.7 cm diameter). Each filter was washed with 0.5 M ammonium formate to remove residual 
salts from the seawater medium. The filters were freeze-dried and weighed again. The samples 
were hydrolysed for 24 h at 100° C with 6N HCl in sealed glass tubes replaced with nitrogen. 
An aliquot of an appropriate amount of the hydrolysate was taken, diluted with 0.25 M borate 
buffer, pH adjusted to 8.5, and was filtered through a 25 μm membrane filter. 
The pH-adjusted samples were reacted with 9-fluroenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC) to 
form amino acid FMOC derivatives using an automated GBC LC 1610 Autosampler, with a 
Hypersil column (150 mm L x 4.6 mm internal diameter). L-hydroxyproline was used as an 
internal standard and was analysed by the precolumn fluorescence derivative method using a

6.2.2.1  Location
This e xperiment was conducted in May-June 2001 at La Trobe University, Department 
of Botany, Melbourne, Australia. The juveniles were provided by Ocean Wave Seafoods, 
Lara, Victoria, Australia. Diatoms and juveniles were grown in a constant temperature room at 
17 ± 2° C with  a 12 L: 12 D photo cycle.
6.2.2.2  Algal culture
The diatom species Navicula sp. was cultured in f/2 medium with varying nitrogen levels. 
Three treatments were tested, high nitrogen = 24.71 mg NO3-N L-1, normal = 12.35 mg NO3-N 
L-1 and low = 2.47 mg NO3-N L-1. Cells were grown attached to the bottom of the petri dishes 
until they reached a density of approximately 105 cells cm-2. 
6.2.2.3  Juvenile culture
H. rubra  larvae were settled on a commercial farm and grown until they reached ca. 1 mm 
in shell length. Ten juveniles were placed into each of 4 replicated dishes of each of the 
three treatments (high, normal and low nitrogen). The media was replaced every 3-4 days  
with the respective, fresh autoclaved media . After 2 and 4 weeks juveniles were transferred 
into dishes with fresh cultures. The diatoms in previous dishes were harvested and processed 
for biochemical analysis. The shell length of post-larvae was measured initially and every 
6-8 days for the 32-day duration of the experiment started. 
6.2.2.4  Sample preparation and amino acid analysis 
Diatom samples were collected at week two, four and at the end of the experiment and analysed 
for amino acid composition. The amino acid composition of all of the 36 samples (3 times x 
3 treatments x 4 replicates) were analysed using a HPLC (GBC Scientific Equipment).
The samples were washed with 0.5 M ammonium formate to remove residual salts from the 
seawater medium and freeze-dried. Approximately 3 mg of each of the freeze-dried material 
was transferred to glass hydrolysis tubes. 0.5 mL of 6M HCL containing 1 mM phenol was 
added. The tubes were purged with nitrogen gas and then flame sealed. Sealed tubes were 
incubated at 110° C for approximately 12 hours. Hydrolysates were transferred to 1.5 mL 
microfuge tubes and centrifuged to remove cell debris. 50 mL of the hydrolysates were dried 
in a speedy-vac (Savant). The dried samples were resuspended with 100 mL of 250 mM 
borate buffer. The samples were derivatised for amino acid analyses using FMOC with a total 
derivatised sample volume of 400 mL according to the method of Ou et al. (1996).
6.2.2.5  Data analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using the STATISTICA computer package. Assumption 
of normality and homogeneity of variance were checked graphically for each data set using 
boxplots (means vs. variances, residuals vs. means).  Data of abalone shell length were 
analysed as a repeated measure analyses of variance with Turkeys HSD post-hoc test. Two-way 
analyses of variance (ANOV A) were used to test whether the dry weight of the residual algae 
differed among algal harvest times and between the treatments in the La Trobe experiment. 
Relationships between the shell length, growth and survival of the juveniles and the total 70                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        71amino acid composition of the feed species at the end of the experiment were explored with 
simple regression analyses.
6.3 Results
6.3.1  Experiment conducted at Southern Ocean Mariculture
6.3.1.1  Amino acid composition of algae and abalone
The mean amounts of individual and total essential amino acids (TEAA), and individual 
and total non-essential amino acids (TNEAA) in the total amino acid (TAA) pool for algae 
are given in Table 31. Nine EAA and seven NEAA were quantified. The TAA content 
was lowest in the low nitrogen treatment (604 μmol g-1 dry sample) followed by the high 
nitrogen treatment (1134 μmol g-1 dry sample) and highest in normal nitrogen treatment 
(1526 μmol g-1 dry sample). Samples in low nitrogen treatment (LN) showed lower values 
in all amino acids except of the EAA lysine. Several essential AA (arginine, histidine and 
methionine) and the non-essential AA ornithine/proline were substantially lower in low 
nitrogen treatments. On average EAA contributed 37% of the TAA in low nitrogen treatment, 
42% in normal nitrogen treatment and 46% in high nitrogen treatment. There was no significant 
difference in sample dry weight between the treatments (one way ANOV A, F = 1.03, df = 2, 
p = 0.41).
The mean amounts of individual and total essential amino acids (TEAA), and individual and 
total non-essential amino acids (TNEAA) in the total amino acid (TAA) pool, for abalone, is 
listed in Table 32. Both individual and total amino acids were very similar across the treatments. 
Approximately 31-32% of TAA were essential AA whereas the remaining 68-69% belong to 
the non-essential AA. The non-essential AA proline was the most dominant amino acid in pre-
settled larvae and young juveniles feeding on Navicula sp. but not in adult Haliotis rufescens . 
Lysine contributed only 2% of TAA in animals of all treatments whereas about 6-7% of TAA 
are reported to be lysine in samples of abalone of other developmental stages (Table 32).70                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        71Table 31.

6.3.1.2  Growth and survival of juvenile abalone
At the start of the experiment, juveniles averaged 1.2 mm in shell length and reached 2 mm in 
both the high and normal nitrogen treatment (Figure 22). Juveniles in low nitrogen treatment 
however, averaged only 1.7 mm in shell length. There was a significant difference between the 
treatments (F = 6.52, df = 2, p = 0.04) and between the different measurement times (F = 84.9, 
df = 3, p < 0.001). In addition, the interaction between the treatments and time was highly 
significant (F = 7.0, df = 6, p < 0.001). The post-hoc test revealed a significant difference between 
low and high nitrogen (Tukeys HSD, p = 0.04). The growth rates of juveniles were highest in 
the high nitrogen treatment (42 ± 10.1 μm day-1) followed by the normal nitrogen treatment 
(30 ± 5.5 μm day-1). Growth rates were lowest in the low nitrogen treatment (21 ± 8.7 μm day-1). 
Juveniles survived best in high nitrogen treatment (81%) followed by the normal nitrogen 
treatment (76%) and the low nitrogen treatment (48%).72                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        730.000.501.001.502.002.50

6.3.2.1  Amino acid composition of algae
The dry weight of algal samples did differ significantly between harvests (2 way ANOV A, 
F = 44.94, df = 2, p < 0.001). The second harvest yielded more biomass than harvest 1 and 3 
resulting in less total amino acid content (Table 33). However no significant difference was 
observed in dry weight between treatments (F = 0.78, df = 2, p = 0.47).

total non-essential amino acids (TNEAA) in the total amino acid (TAA) pool for each harvests 
is given in Table 34. Nine EAA and eight NEAA were quantified. In low nitrogen treatments 
(LN) all EAA and NEAA decreased. The decrease was particularly high in the essential EAA 
arginine (about 50%). Individual amino acids in samples from the high and normal nitrogen 
treatments were very similar. In the low nitrogen treatment the total amino acid content 
(TAA = 407 μmol g -1 dry sample) was reduced by ca. 37% compared to the high and normal 
nitrogen treatments (TAA = 643 μmol g -1 dry sample, 641 μmol g -1 dry sample respectively) 
(Table 34). The reduction was slightly higher in essential amino acids (EAA = 40%) than in 
non-essential amino acids (NEAA = 35%). On average EAA contributed 47% of the TAA in 
low nitrogen treatments, whereas an average of 49% EAA where estimated in both high and 
normal nitrogen treatments.

Juveniles averaged 1.8 mm in shell length at the start of the experiment. Animals feeding 
on the diatoms grown in high and normal nitrogen media reached 3 mm in shell length after 
33 days (Figure 23). Juveniles in low nitrogen treatment were on average 0.3 mm smaller 74                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        75at the end of the trial. There was a significant difference between the treatments (F = 12.2, 
df = 2, p = 0.005) and between the different measurement times (F = 387.1, df = 5, p < 0.0001). 
In addition the interaction between the treatments and time was highly significant (F = 8.7, 
df = 10, p < 0.001). The post-hoc test revealed a significant difference between low and high 
nitrogen (Tukeys HSD, p = 0.007) and between low and normal nitrogen (Tukeys HSD, 
p = 0.018).

The correlation between survival and total amino acid content was not significant (F = 1.03,

growth (F = 2.57, df = 1, p = 0.14) or between the total dry weight and the survival (F = 1.27, 
df = 1, p = 0.27) at the end of the experiment.
6.4 Discussion
Juveniles of the abalone Haliotis rubra  feeding on the diatom Navicula sp. grown in limited 
nitrogen media grow slower than when feeding on the same species of diatom grown in normal 76                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        77or higher nitrogen media. Shell length and growth rates were affected by the diet and, as 
evident from the significant correlation, the differences were most likely related to the total 
amino acid contents of the diets. In addition, survival was lower in low nitrogen treatment. 
However, no significant correlation could be found between survival and the total amino acid 
contents of the diets. 
It is uncertain which other factors related to the diets might have affected survival. 
We observed that cells in all treatments were readily ingested so it is unlikely that diatoms in 
the LN treatment produce a feeding deterrent. No significant differences in biomass yield of 
residual food were found between the treatments. The growth rate of the feed species however, 
could have varied under different nitrogen regimes, providing juveniles with different amounts 
of feed. These however, must have been compensated by different grazing rates of the animals 
to result in similar residual biomass between the treatments. Food was always offered in access 
and is thus unlikely to cause differences in survival. 
Brown (1991) reported that aspartate and glutamate were generally the highest components 
in amino acid profiles of 16 species of microalgae. In contrast, we document that alanine and 
glycine were in highest concentration (> 10% of TAA) of the diatom Navicula sp. In agreement 
with Brown (1991) we found arginine and leucine to be the highest components in the pool 
of EAA. 
The nutritional value of a feed species is considered to be high if its essential amino-acid 
composition is closely matched to that in the feeding animal. However, this does not suggest 
that absolute levels of amino acid in the muscle are reflections of the absolute requirements 
for that amino acid (Fleming et al., 1996). Adult abalones are reported to be high in aspartate 
and glutamate whereas arginine, leucine and lysine are the most common ones in the pool of 
essential amino acid (Allen & Kilgore, 1975). The relative proportions of individual essential 
amino acids in the algal diets in this study were in most cases greater or similar than in 
the abalone of two different species and different developmental stages (see Table 32). The 
proportion of lysine, however, was less indicating that lysine might be limiting. Similarly, 
Brown (1991) found a lower proportion of lysine in all microalgal species investigated 
compared to 10-day old oyster larvae. They suggested that this amino acid could be limiting 
in normal algal diets of the animal. Lysine is reported to be the major limiting amino acid in 
pigs feeding on cereal-based diets (Batterham, 1992). Similar to adult abalone, in our study 
lysine was high in larvae but substantially lower in juveniles only feeding on Navicula sp., 
as well as the diet. However, the differences between larvae, juvenile and adult abalone 
displayed in Table 32 have to be treated carefully because different studies and species of 
abalone were compared.
Proline was the most predominant NEAA followed by glutamate and glycine in pre-settled 
larvae and young juveniles feeding on Navicula sp. only, whereas leucine, threonine and 
arginine were found in high quantity in the pool of EAA (Litaay et al., 2001; Daume 
unpublished data; Table 32). Proline is considered to be an essential amino acid for molluscs 
by Harrison (1975) but this was not confirmed for abalone (Allen and Kilgore, 1975). 
Despite the similarity in amino acid composition of the treatments, the total amounts varied 
significantly between the treatments. TAA was lower in the low nitrogen treatment at all three 
times of harvest and TAA was correlated with the growth of the juveniles. Similarly, Fleming 
(1995) found a significant relationship between the intakes of digestible nitrogen and the 
growth rates of adult H. rubra when feeding on seaweeds, suggesting that nitrogen is a limiting 76                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        77nutrient for abalone growth. Juvenile abalone are likely to require more protein and energy per 
unit of body weight because their rate of growth is higher than that of adults. Thus, it is likely 
that any small increase in nitrogen and TAA in the feed can result in an increase in growth-rate 
even over a short period of time. 
At abalone farms in Australia the seawater is enriched with a mixed fertiliser (Aquasol, Hortico 
Ltd and Sodium metasilicate) at approximately 3-4 mg L-1 equivalent to 0.7-0.9 mg NO3-N 
L-1 to enhance diatom growth. This dose is well below the level in our low nitrogen treatment 
and our result suggests that algae grown in the nursery might be nitrogen limited. In addition, 
Henley et al. (1991) showed that N-deficiency causes greater sensitivity to bright light in algae 
and prevented recovery of photoinhibition. This indicates that a too low dose of nitrogen in the 
high light nursery environment can also influence the quantity (growth rate) of the algae. 
We suggest, in order to achieve uniformity in nutritional quality of feed species in abalone 
nurseries, the nitrogen level should be monitored and supplied at an optimal rate between 
2-12 mg NO3-N L-1. A higher nitrogen level would be wasteful and uneconomic because the 
TAA did not further increase and did not result in higher growth-rates of the abalone. This 
indicates that the TAA level in the NN treatment was sufficient to maintain high growth-rates 
of the abalone. Pulse feeding could be considered where nutrients are only added 1-2 times a 
week and the water flow is turned off for a period of 24 hours. Ryther et al. (1981) showed that 
nitrogen-starved algae could take up nitrogen very fast and double their total nitrogen content 
in less than 8 hours. Algae returned to not enriched flowing seawater were able to maintain the 
higher growth for up to 2 weeks. 
In this study we demonstrated the importance of maintaining the right level of nitrogen to achieve 
a high value feed for optimal abalone juvenile growth. Further studies are needed to determine 
the feeding regime of nutrient addition to the tanks to maintain high quality and quantity 
of feed under nursery conditions and to increase the cost efficiency of algal production in 
abalone nurseries.

This project has made significant improvements in nursery management strategies for both 
blacklip ( Haliotis rubra ) and greenlip ( H. laevigata ) abalone. The aim of the project has been 
to determine suitable algal species for improving settlement and growth-rates of abalone 
during the nursery phase.  We identified the green alga Ulvella lens  as a suitable settlement 
inducer for both Haliotis rubra and H. laevigata larvae. Settlement rates have been improved 
from 0-10% to 40-60%, which is well beyond the 20-30% set as a performance indicator in 
the original application. The surface area needed for settlement (settlement plates and tanks) 
will be reduced, which will result in lower capital and labour costs through weaning or re-
settlement. Methods have been developed for commercial scale algal culture. By the end of 
this project, the culture methods for Ulvella lens  had been adopted at most abalone farms in 
Australia. The industry will benefit by high and consistent larval settlement. Beyond the scope 
of this project U. lens  proved to be a good food source for juveniles larger than 3 mm in shell 
length. This will help to overcome problems of shortage in adequate feed (both quantity and 
quality) on the plates particularly at later stages of the nursery phase. However, U. lens has 
limited value as a feed for growing post-larvae. Instead, a cultured diatom species can be added 
after the settlement phase. 
During this project we identified a suitable diatom species ( Navicula sp.) that can be cultured 
on a commercial scale. Promising growth-rates of 30-40 μm day-1 were achieved with this 
diatom species during the first 2 months of post-larval development. Methods for large-scale 
culture were refined to allow the culture of this attaching, benthic diatom species. However, 
only batch cultures were used in this project. The mass culture of diatoms has not been adopted 
at farms in southern Australia as yet because abalone farmers regard diatom production as 
being too costly. Better control and intensification of the system has been achieved through 
the mass culture of selected diatom species. The survival of juvenile abalone was significantly 
higher and the feed on the plate was improved in both quality and quantity. As a result, higher 
densities of juveniles were maintained per plate throughout the nursery phase. Growth-rates 
of post-larvae were improved by about 30-50%, and hence the cost for animals up to 10 mm 
will decrease and seed can be produced cheaper. Since the initial results of this project were 
conveyed to and adopted by industry, juvenile abalone prices have in fact declined.
8.0 Further development
The industry is currently experiencing high juvenile mortalities at weaning and food shortage 
at the later stages of the nursery phase. Further research is needed to improve formulated 
feeds for younger juveniles. Alternatively, a suitable algal species could be sought to improve 
growth-rates and harvest size of juveniles at the end of the nursery phase (juveniles 5 mm+ 
in shell length. In addition, the mass culture of diatoms and other algal species needs to be 
optimised to increase the cost efficiency of algal production. An interactive CD has been 
produced to extend the presently used methods for algal culture to industry in a user-friendly 
form. This CD could be extended to include a cost-benefit analysis of management strategies, 
which address issues such as stocking density and food management on the plate. This would 
provide a decision making tool for farmers, to select a nursery system that meets their needs.80                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        819.0 Conclusion
9.1 Settlement – laboratory
Laboratory experiments in Chapter 1 and 2 have shown that the macroalga Ulvella lens is a 
suitable settlement inducer for larvae of the abalone Haliotis rubra and Haliotis laevigata.  
Settlement rates have been improved from around 1-10% to 30-60%. Settlement was 
significantly lower on plates with biofilms dominated by diatoms. Settlement was higher on 
older compared to younger plants and biofilms but settlement on U. lens appears to be reduced 
when previously inoculated with a diatom species. However, inoculation with diatoms has 
advantages for the subsequent growth of the post-larvae. Settlement plates conditioned with 
algae ( U. lens  or diatoms) that were pre-grazed by juvenile abalone induced higher larval 
settlement than plates that were not grazed prior to larval settlement.  
Greenlip ( H. laevigata ) larvae show less species-specific response. The difference between 
the algal species and developmental stages tested were not as pronounced than with blacklip 
(H. rubra ) larvae. 
Marked differences in overall settlement rates were found between larval batches. Antibiotic 
treatment enhanced the survival of the larvae in experimental containers but did not enhance 
the settlement rate nor did it change settlement preferences. The results indicate that unfit 
larval may survive if treated with antibiotics but they do not settle successfully.
9.2 Growth and survival – laboratory
Growth-rates reached 30-40 µm day-1 when feeding on the cultured diatom Navicula  sp. 
during the first two months of rearing. Growth-rates were significantly lower on the macroalga 
U. lens . The green alga U. lens  is not sufficient for the initial growth of the abalone 
H. rubra . However, when animals reached ca. 2 mm in shell length the growth-rates improved 
and were in some cases comparable to growth-rates of juveniles feeding on diatoms. When 
single species diets were compared to a combination of the macroalga U. lens  and the diatom 
Navicula  sp., growth-rates reached 42 µm day-1 on the combined diet but only 35 µm day-1 on 
single species diets. Survival up to 2 months post settlement was highest on the combination 
(70%) and lowest on the diatom only. 
9.3 Settlement – commercial scale
Settlement rates in large-scale experiments in the nursery were amongst the highest recorded in 
commercial nurseries suggesting that the conditioning technique of the settlement plate using 
the macroalgae U. lens  was efficient and reliable. Larval release density was not detected as 
a significant effect on settlement rates of H. rubra . Larvae showed a strong preference for 
substrates covered with older U. lens . The settlement was higher on older U. lens plates with 
less percentage cover. 
9.4 Growth and survival – commercial scale
Growth rates were improved to 35 µm day-1 during the first month, 50 µm day-1 during the second 
month and 100 µm day-1 during the third month of rearing. The experiments demonstrated, 80                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        81that animal density and light (which affects the food density) have very remarkable effects on 
growth. The survival was strongly density-dependent after 64 days when the food started to 
become limiting. 
Experiment 5 in Chapter 5 clearly demonstrated that U. lens  is a suitable food source for 
juveniles larger than 3 mm. Juveniles started to remove parts of U. lens when they reached 
3 mm in shell length. Juveniles feeding on U. lens  grow significantly faster and survived better 
than on the diatom Navicula sp. or a formulated feed. The formulated feed used might not be 
well matched for the nutritional requirements of small juveniles and other formulae should 
be tried. The growth-rates of juveniles feeding on formulated feed improved towards the end 
of the trial indicating that the feed might be suitable for juveniles larger than 4 mm in shell 
length. Unless a suitable formulated feed is found, which can match growth-rates achieved 
with the macroalga U. lens  we suggest keeping animals on plates colonised by U. lens as long 
as possible.
9.5 Algal culture and biochemical composition of algae
Methods were developed for large-scale culture and succession of algal species and are 
outlined in chapter 4. Plates are initially colonised with U. lens for settlement and after 
settlement inoculated with the cultured diatom Navicula  sp. for post-larval growth. Plates with 
recently settled larvae were inoculated without any harm to the animals.
Nitrogen is regarded as a limiting nutrient for abalone growth (Fleming, 1995) and we established 
in Chapter 6 that a 10-fold increase in nitrogen resulted in higher total amino acid levels in 
the diatom feed species and an increase in growth-rates of the juveniles. We suggest, in order 
to achieve uniformity in nutritional quality of feed species in abalone nurseries, the nitrogen 
level should be monitored and supplied at an optimal rate between 2 and 12 mg NO3-L-1. 
A higher nitrogen level would be wasteful and uneconomic, while lower nitrogen levels would 
result in lower growth rates of the juveniles.
In collaboration with CSIRO we established, that there is a difference in fatty acid compositions 
between the diatom and the macroalgal species used in this study. Navicula sp. is rich in 
20:5n-3 whereas the major fatty acids in U. lens include 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 (see Appendix 
1 for details). In contrast to other macroalgae, U. lens  had a relatively high protein content of 
31-38 %, which is comparable to that of diatom species like Navicula sp. This could explain 
why juveniles larger than 3 mm in shell length grew very well on U. lens .
9.6 Recommendations to industry
We suggest that plates with a low cover of young germlings of U. lens could be used for 
settlement induction and followed with an inoculation with Navicula sp. to ensure sufficient 
food for the growing post-larvae during the first 1-2 months of rearing. Alternatively, new 
plates colonised with cultured diatoms only could be introduced into the tanks if older plates 
with very high cover of U. lens  are used for settlement. Settlement plates with developing 
U. lens germlings leave adequate space on the plates for a cultured diatom film to develop but 
will result in a lower settlement density. After 2 months U. lens  will provide sufficient food for 
the animals and plates can be re-seeded with spores or alternatively additional plates colonised 
with U. lens  can be added every month. In addition the stocking density should be reduced to 
50 juveniles per plate before the food becomes limiting.82                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        8310.0 Appendices

Outline
As the first part of the contract, CSIRO Marine Research analysed the proximate composition 
of samples of 29 algae used as diatom feed. They were supplied by Dr Sabine Daume, Deakin 
University.
Sample history and processing (prior to analysis)
Samples were dispatched to CSIRO on two occasions:
1. On the 10/10/2000, CSIRO received filtered, frozen samples of both Cylindrotheca  
closterium  and Navicula  sp. These were obtained from log and stationary phase from 
three replicate cultures, provided as 2 x 47 mm filters per culture – thus making a total of 
24 filters. The samples had been filtered through pre-weighed filters, washed with 
ammonium formate (done at Deakin) and upon arrival to CSIRO were freeze-dried to 
estimate the material available per filter for analyses.
 At the same time, additional cultures were received and filtered separately (250 to 400 mL 
culture) through pre-weighed, precombusted filters, washed with ammonium formate, dried 
(100° C, 24 h), then ashed (450º C, 24 h) for the determination of the % ash weight.
2. On the 14/11/00, a second batch of samples were received, as frozen samples (harvested 
at Deakin and washed with ammonium formate) in glass vials. These were from Ulvella 
lens, Sporolithon  sp, and Cocconeis  sp. Samples were also immediately freeze dried, and 
weighed to estimate the material available for analysis.
Sample codes, and weight available for the analyses are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Methods:
Because the samples from the different batches were received in different forms, this 
necessitated different analytical approaches.
Batch 1 (filter samples from 10/10):
Lipid : Lipid was extracted from the filters (all odd numbers filters in Table 1, i.e. 1, 3, 5, etc) 
by the Bligh and Dyer method, as outlined in Dunstan et al. (1992). Solvent was removed from 
the extracts, and the % lipid was determined gravimetrically.
Protein and carbohydrate:  Because only one, 47 mm filter sample was available for both 
carbohydrate and protein, we first had to homogenize the filter to sub-sample. Hence each 
filter was added to a glass beaker with 10 ml of water then homogenized to a fine pulp by 
using a tissue homogeniser for 30 secs. 1 ml aliquots were then removed, and analysed for both 
protein and carbohydrate. Protein was analysed colorimetrically using the method of Clayton 
et al. (1988). Carbohydate was determined after hydrolysis of the samples by the method of 
Dubois et al. (1956).
Extracellular (culture filtrate) carbohydrate: Samples were filtered through GF/C filters, and 
filtrates were analysed for carbohydrate using a colorimetric assay (Mykelstad et al., 1997).
Ash was determined from the % weight loss of the dried material on glass-fibre filters (prepared 
by filtering culture samples at CSIRO, and subsequent washing with ammonium formate, and Appendix 1 cont.86                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        87drying) after combusting at 450° C for 24 h. 
Batch 2  (frozen samples from 14/11/00):
Samples had first been freeze-dried, and the total amounts available for all analyses are 
specified in Table 2. 
Where possible, we used the following amounts for the various analyses, as we consider these 
as optimal required for the analysis.
lipid – 100 mg
protein, carbohydrate – 5 mg each
ash – 50 mg
The biochemical analyses used were otherwise the same as those cited above, for batch 1.
Results and Discussion: 
Results for the proximate analysis of samples provided in Batches 1 and 2 are given in Tables 
3 and 4. The discussion of the results from the different batches is given separately.
Batch 1:
There appears to be a major discrepancy with the results, as for most of the samples, the sum 
of ash, lipid, protein and CHO adds up to <50% (Table 3). Whilst there can be some minor 
inaccuracies with the methodologies for some specific samples (esp. CHO where, if the sample/
alga contains unique sugars that give different colour reactions to glucose), nevertheless our 
previous experience is that sum values should add to between 75-105% of the dry weight.
The most likely factor that could account for this was an inefficient washing of the filters using 
ammonium formate. For example, if only 50% of the seawater had been removed (i.e. replaced 
with ammonium formate) this would be sufficient to add between 20 to 40 mg of “apparent” 
dry weight, thus leading to significant underestimations of lipid, carbohydrate and protein (by 
1⁄2 or more).
There are three reasons that suggest inefficient washing as the cause for these apparent 
discrepancies:
1. Separate culture samples filtered at CSIRO for ash determination using approx. the same 
volumes as filtered for the other (lipid, protein, CHO) filters, contained between 4 to 20 mg 
(average ≈ 10 mg). These samples were all washed with 15-20 ml of ammonium formate. 
This compared to average values of algal biomass retained on the other (lipid, protein, 
CHO) filters, of ≈ 30 mg (see Table 1).
2. Usually filters will clog up once 10 to 20 mg of algal biomass is retained
3. Filter samples 6, 12 and 24 had by far the lowest “apparent biomass” (i.e. 13.4, 7.7 and 
5.8 mg respectively; Table 1). These samples also had the highest estimated % protein and 
% CHO, and also typical of values we would expect. This suggests that the reason these 
samples had the lowest biomass (and correspondingly highest % protein and % CHO) was 
because these were washed efficiently with ammonium formate, whereas other samples 
were not.86                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        87Concentrations of total extracellular CHO in the Cylindrotheca  and Navicula  samples ranged 
from 27 to 80 µg mL-1 of culture, with average values of Cylindrotheca  and Navicula  similar. 
Typically, 60 to 80% of the total CHO was present as polysaccharide (Table 5).
Batch 2:
Sporolithon  was very high in ash and contained very little lipid. At the low levels of detected 
lipid, the analyses can become inaccurate, but nevertheless it would be accurate to quote 
Sporolithon  as containing < 0.4% of lipid.
As seen from Table 2, the low amounts of Cocconeis  samples compromised our ability to 
obtain accurate analyses for most samples. However, for samples 2 and 3 we had sufficient 
samples, yet the sum of ash, lipid, protein and CHO adds up to <20%. The following reasons 
are suggested to account for the remaining ≈ 80%:
- some 5 to 10% of the freeze-dried sample could be moisture
- if the sugar composition of polysaccharides is unique (e.g. low glucose) then there is the 
potential to underestimate CHO. Normally this is not a problem as most microalgae contain 
> 50% glucose. However, for example, pentoses, methylpentoses and uronic acids are inert 
and do not give a positive colour reaction.
- “fibre” is not detected by the assay (but usually it is < 5 to 10% of algal biomass).
- protein could be underestimated, if there was a problem with efficiently extracting it from 
the sample
- similarly, lipid could be underestimated, if there was a problem with efficiently extracting 
it from the sample (this can be an issue with certain algae).

Background to study and objectives:
The biochemical composition of algae changes according to the environmental conditions to 
which it is subjected, and potentially this can impact on the growth rate of abalone feeding 
on such algal diets. Abalone farmers culture algae for feeding to newly settled abalone, and 
manipulate algal growth by varying light and nutrient levels. 
Our objective was to measure the biological performance (growth rates, % survival) of newly 
settled abalone, fed one diatom ( Navicula  sp.) and one macroalgae ( Ulvella  lens) grown under 
two light and two nitrogen regimes, and a formulated diet (control).  
Methods:
• Newly-set juvenile abalone were obtained from Tas. Tiger Abalone, and cultured for 
6 weeks. The shell length of post-larval abalone were measured every second week using 
Leica stereo- microscope (x 16 eyepiece, 3.2 x zoom).
• The growth assay comprised twelve treatments [3 (diets) x 2 (sodium nitrogen 
concentrations) x 2 (light intensities) factorial], each with four replicates (Table 6).

• There were eight abalone per replicate culture vessel (250 ml petri dish). 
• An isothermal growth room (17 ° C) with shelves lit by independent light sources were 
set up to be radiated at a high and low intensity (120 μE m-2 sec-1, 40 μE m-2 sec-1) on a 
18:6 light regime, each shelf held half the culture vessels. The replicates within each light 
regime were randomly assigned the treatment diets (Table 6), which were:
- Navicula  sp. cultured with low nitrogen medium (15 mg/l)
- Naviculs  sp. cultured with high nitrogen medium (150 mg/l)
- Ulvella  lens cultured with low nitrogen medium (15 mg/l)
- Ulvella  lens cultured with high nitrogen medium (150 mg/l)Appendix 1 cont.90                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        91- powdered formulated diet with low nitrogen medium (15 mg/l)
- powdered formulated diet with high nitrogen medium (150 mg/l)
The procedures for maintaining algal cultures were as following:
Navicula sp.
Week 1: set up four small petri dishes for stock cultures, one of each treatment combination  
(two with low nitrogen medium- one low light LNLL, one high light LNHL, two with high 
nitrogen medium- one low light HNLL, one high light HNHL)
Week 2: transfer once a week 1 ml from each small petri dishes into four new small dishes, 
from each small dish set up four large petri dishes grow under same conditions, grow for 
5-7 days, repeat 2. task every second week.
Ulvella lens
Week 1: of 32 large petri dishes containing disks (sent from Sabine) covered with Ulvella 
lens (+two spare sets) place 16 in the dark, 8 with low nitrogen medium, 8 with high 
nitrogen medium, place 4 dishes LN LL, 4 dishes HN LL and 4 dishes LN HL, 4 dishes 
HN HL.
•  Abalone in control vessels with powdered formulated diet were grown in the same light 
and nutrient regimes as the living diets (thus emulating abalone farms) to examine if these 
regimes have an effect on abalone growth.
• Culture vessels were not aerated but media was changed every Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday.
• Dead/missing abalone were replaced with abalone of similar treatment history.
• Every second week the abalone from the Navicula sp., treatments were gently transferred 
to fresh culture vessels containing logarithmic cultures of Navicula sp., and the appropriate 
culture media and light history.  Negligible “crawl-out” and mortality occurred with 
abalone from the Navicula sp. treatments.  But between weeks 4 and 6 the HNHL plates 
were significantly contaminated with a Tetraselmis -like flagellate.
• It was intended that the abalone from the Ulvella  lens treatments be transferred to fresh 
culture vessels every second week.  Due to the high degree of abalone “crawl-out” (when 
abalone climb up the wall of the vessel and sit above the water level, desiccating) and 
resultant high mortalities, by the end of week 2 these treatments had to be discontinued.
• The abalone from the formulated feed treatments were fed every two days.  Due to heavy 
fouling and high mortalities, (but a low incidence of “crawl out”), the abalone were gently 
transferred to fresh culture vessels at the beginning of week 2.  By the end of week 2 these 
treatments also had to be discontinued due to high mortalities (Oxygen problem??).
• Diets were collected at week two and week six and analysed for proximate (% protein, 
% CHO, % lipid) and fatty acid composition, where enough sample was available.  After 
removal of the abalone, the entire algal film was removed using a spatula from each culture 
vessel and placed on foil and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  90                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        91Results and Discussion:
Composition of diets:
There were some major differences in the proximate composition (% of organic weight, OW) 
of Navicula  samples collected on the 29/12/00 and on the 26/01/01, respectively and Ulvella  
samples (Table 7). Within the 2 groups of Navicula  samples, there was no significant difference 
in composition attributable to the different light x nitrogen combinations, though it appeared 
higher nitrogen cultures had slightly higher % protein. Ulvella  grown under high nitrogen had 
more protein but less carbohydrate than Ulvella  grown under low nitrogen (Table 7).
For Navicula  samples, a higher total biomass (mg OW/plate) was produced in samples grown 
under a higher light intensity, irrespective of nitrogen concentration (Table 7).
There were no significant differences in the percentages of fatty acids in Navicula  that could 
be attributed to the different light x nitrogen treatments. All samples were rich in 20:5n-3 
(18 to 23%) and had low amounts of 22:6n-3 (1.6 to 2.4%) (Table 8 and Appendix 1). In 
contrast, major fatty acids in Ulvella  samples included 18:2n-6 (17 to 18%) and 18:3n-3 
(23 to 25%) (Table 8).
Growth rates of abalone:
The survival of abalone fed the different Navicula  diets were all high (87 to 96%) and not 
significantly different (Table 9). However, the diets of Ulvella  and formulated feed (FF) both 
gave poor survival (3% and 23%), and were therefore not effective in these culture systems. 
We also found that “crawl out” of abalone (i.e. attempting to escape from plates) was significant 
in the Ulvella  lens and FF plates. These latter treatments were discontinued after 2 weeks.
Abalone fed Navicula  diets showed similar growth rates between treatments measured over 
various time periods, except:
- from 2 to 4 weeks, the Lo-N, Hi-light treatment produced a lower growth rate than all 
other treatments
- over the whole experiment,  the Lo-N, Hi-light treatment produced a lower growth rate 
than the Hi-N, Hi-light treatment (Table 9). 
There were several factors that contributed to our inability to see differences in abalone growth 
associated to the difference in Navicula  treatments:
1) there were no significant different in the biochemical composition of Navicula  
grown under the different treatments – despite quite different environmental culture 
conditions.
2) despite 4 replicates per treatment, the growth of microalgae was not always consistent 
between replicates (patchy in distribution, and differing in total biomass). For example, 
the co-efficient of variation of OW biomass/plate ranged from 15 to 80% within 
treatments.Appendix 1 cont.92                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        93Table 7.

It was also noted that between weeks 4 to 6 the Navicula  plates grown under Hi-N, 
Hi-light treatment developed significant amounts of a flagellate resembling Tetraselmis . This 
confounded the interpretation of the efficacy of this diet treatment from week 4 to week 6, and 
over the whole experiment.
As we did not see differences in the biochemical composition of the Navicula  cultures, 
we undertook additional analyses to see whether there might be a relationship between the 
OW/plate and the growth of abalone within culture units. Because of the contamination of 
flagellates within the Hi-N, Hi-light treatments, we excluded this data from the analysis. 
We found a negative correlation between the amount of food on plates, and the growth of 
abalone (p < 0.02; adj. r2 = 0.43) (see scatter chart; Fig 1). This suggested that abalone were 
satiated at lower algal concentrations, and increased food densities were having a negative 
impact on growth.94                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        950.05.010.015.020.025.0

Abstract
The settlement, shell growth and recruitment of abalone Haliotis rubra  on plates seeded with 
the macroalga Ulvella lens  and inoculated with the microalga Navicula sp. were examined 
in 6 commercial nursery tanks.  U. lens produced a greater settlement rate of larvae at 34% 
± 2.28 ( ± S.E., n = 3) than Navicula sp. at 18% ± 6.83 ( ± S.E., n = 3) however it was not 
statistically significant (p > 0.05). There was no significant added variance from among tanks 
within treatments.  A simultaneous settlement trial conducted in the laboratory exposed the 
same cohort of larvae to 2 macroalgae ( Sporolithon durum  and U. lens ) and 3 benthic diatom 
films ( Navicula sp., Cocconeis sp. and Cylindrotheca closterium ).  Excluding the positive 
control ( S. durum ), U. lens  produced the greatest settlement rate at 20% ± 4.8 ( ± S.E., n = 6), 
however it was not significantly greater than the Navicula  sp. (13.8% ± 0.8), or the Cocconeis  
sp treatments (10.0% ± 1.3) (p > 0.05).  C. closterium  resulted in the lowest settlement rate at 
2.8% ± 1.3 ( ± S.E., n = 6) which was not significantly different to the negative control (clean 
plastic).  Post-larvae grazing on Navicula  sp. had a significantly greater shell length than those 
grazing on U. lens , over the 35 day commercial scale nursery feeding trial (p < 0.05). The 
shell length curves diverged between day 21 and 28, as post-larvae grazing on Navicula  sp. 
had a peak in the growth rate (64 μm day-1) between these days.  At day 35, Navicula  sp. and 
U. lens  produced mean shell lengths of 1.82 mm ± 0.43 and 1.76 mm ± 0.46 ( ± S.E., n = 3).
At 42 days post-settlement, the recruitment (juveniles/side of a nursery plate) for the U. lens  
and the Navicula  sp. treatments were 226 ± 16 ( ± S.E., n = 3) and 73 ± 5 (± S.E., n = 3)
respectively, which was significantly different (p < 0.05). There was no significant effect of 
tank-to-tank variation within the U. lens  treatment (p > 0.05), in contrast, the Navicula sp. 
treatment resulted in tank-to-tank variation (p < 0.05).  This commercial scale nursery trial 
suggests that the macroalgae U. lens  can result in greater recruitment of juvenile abalone than 
the cultured Navicula sp. and can sustain only slightly reduced growth despite a much higher 
density of abalone on plates than the Navicula sp. 
1.0 Introduction
Abalone nursery operations continue to experience inconsistent and inefficient seed production 
(Roberts et al., 1998).  In Australia juvenile abalone production relies predominantly on 
naturally developing biofilms as a settlement cue and food source (Daume et al., in print).  
Benthic diatoms with their extracellular secretions can be the dominant component in a 
naturally developing biofilm.  In addition bacteria, fungi, other microbes and organic molecules 
will be present in a biofilm (Roberts, in print).  In extensive nursery operations there is limited 
control of naturally developing biofilms.  96                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        97In a previous laboratory study Daume et al. (2000) showed that settlement of blacklip abalone, 
Haliotis rubra  on Ulvella lens  was higher than on monospecific benthic diatom films.  
U. lens  is a crustose green macroalga that grows as prostrate rosettes on hard surfaces (Roberts, 
in print). Settlement of up to 52% was achieved with germlings of U. lens .  This is supported 
by the study by Takahashi and Koganezawa (1988), that found U. lens  resulted in 60-70% 
settlement of H. discus hannai larvae . 
Benthic diatoms are considered to be the primary food for abalone prior to consuming 
macroalgae (Tomita and Tazawa, 1971; Kawamura, 1996; Kawamura et al., 1998).  A diatom 
strain with the attribute of being tightly-attached to a substrate can be beneficial for post-larvae 
>1,000 μm, as it results in the cell wall being ruptured during grazing allowing post-larvae 
access to the cell contents improving digestion (Kawamura et al., 1995).  In a study with four 
benthic diatom strains and two macroalgae, Daume et al. (2000) found that films of a tightly 
attached Navicula sp. produced significantly larger post-larvae with greater survival from 
1 week post-settlement to week 11 (Daume et al., in print).
The attribute of being tightly attached is also critical in obtaining and maintaining a suitable 
diatom film in an extensive nursery environment. In Australia culturing of diatoms for abalone 
nursery operations has had little success because “surface oriented” diatoms species with 
unknown nutritional value have been used.  These diatoms can be cultured in suspension but 
do not attach and divide well on the surface of vertical nursery plates (Krsinich, A., unpubl. 
data; Farrell, S., pers. obs.).  As a consequence, these cultured diatoms are not good “space 
competitors” on the surface of a nursery plate, which results in a wild biofilm out-competing 
the cultured diatom.  The Navicula sp. (isolated for Daume et al., in print) is a “true” benthic 
diatom and thus cannot be successfully cultured in suspension like other planktonic diatom 
species.  However larger-scale culture of this isolate can be achieved by using progressively 
larger surface areas.   
In Japan U. lens  plates in the nursery environment have been used as a diet for juveniles 
resulting in increased production with larger juveniles (Takahashi and Koganezawa, 1988).  
It has been reported that the U. lens  sustained growth of post-larvae after settlement, however, 
the initial growth rate of post-larvae on U. lens  was lower compared to diatom films (Seki, 
1997 cited in Kawamura, et al., 1998; Daume et al., 2000).  It has been shown that the initial 
growth rates of post-larvae on U. lens  have been improved by the inoculation with cultured 
Nitzschia closterium  (Seki, 1997 cited in Kawamura, et al., 1998).  Furthermore it was been 
suggested that the transition from a benthic diatom diet to a macroalgae-dominated diet (such 
as U. lens ) occurs when juveniles have a shell length of about 5,000 µm (Tomita and Tazawa, 
1971, cited in Kawamura, 1996).  The presence of a macroalga such as U. lens  on nursery 
plates may help to alleviate the reported problem of maintaining adequate food when there is 
grazing pressure from larger juveniles and/or copepods (Farrell, S., pers. comm.).  
Intensification of an abalone nursery operation can be achieved by providing an appropriate 
larval settlement clue to improve the rate and consistency of settlement.  In addition if algal 
food is supplied for post-larvae that sustain maximum growth and survival, and increases the 
carrying capacity of the nursery this will further intensify the nursery operation.  
The focus of this study was to intensify a commercial nursery operation for H. rubra  by 
seeding with zoospores from the macroalga U. lens  and inoculating with a “true” benthic 
diatom Navicula sp.

2.1 Nursery Trial: settlement, growth and survival
Preparation of nursery tanks and plates
Six 2000L tanks randomly chosen from Southern Ocean Mariculture (SOM), Port Fairy, 
Victoria were located in a plastic greenhouse covered with 70% shade cloth.  Each tank was 
constructed of a galvanised steel frame with a PVC liner and consisted of a flow-through 
system, 50 cm high PVC standpipe and two air-lines along its length.  Seawater was pumped 
from an adjacent bay and filtered through two sand filters ( ∼70 μm filtration).  Further filtration 
to the intake of each tank was possible with cartridge filters (1 or 5 μm nominal).  
Twelve baskets, each containing 15 clear PVC plates (30 cm x 60 cm x 1.5 mm), were placed 
in each tank (12 x 15 = 180 plates/tank). The sampling unit was a removable platelet (12 cm x 
17 cm) bolted to the centre of one plate and placed in the middle of each basket (Figure 1).  
The platelets’ dimensions allowed them to be easily observed under a stereo microscope.  Each 
platelet had a grid of 16 rectangles (4.25 cm x 3 cm), to allow further division of the platelets 
to assess settlement.  The microscope had a graticule fitted to the eyepiece to measure the shell 
length of the post-larvae.
Protocol to securing U. lens  seed plates   
The protocol to secure adult sporophyte seed plates begin with wild U. lens  zoospores, which 
are present in the incoming nursery seawater.  Two grams of young juvenile abalone with 
a shell length >5 mm are transferred to nursery plates, that have a wild biofilm (Farrell, S., 
pers. comm.).  This grazing pressure with the introduction of unfiltered seawater results in 
a prostrate algal community, which can include the macroalga U. lens .  Plate clippings are 
monitored under the microscope and plates dominated with U. lens are selected.  To the naked 
eye these plates are pale green.  
The selected plates are transferred into a static tub to allow the U. lens to develop with Aquasol 
(Hortico Ltd) added at 80 mg/L.  Each week there is a complete water exchange with 1 μm 98                                                       Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                        99filtered seawater with the addition of new nutrients.  These plates with developing U. lens  need 
to be spawned onto fresh plates to increase the percentage cover of U. lens  and to remove other 
completive algal communities such as Myrionema sp.  
To synchronise a mass release of U. lens  zoospores, adult sporophyte seed plates are placed 
in total darkness for two weeks prior to being used (adapted from Takahashi & Koganezawa, 
1988).  To further aid the mass release of zoospores, the seed plates are desiccated for 
3 minutes before being transferred into a static tank with clean plates with full daylight.
The seed plates spawn 3 to 5 days after the transfer to light and these “spent” seed plates 
should be immediately removed after spawning to reduce competitive algae on the old seed 
plates from contaminating the next generation of U. lens plates.
Seeding of nursery plates with U. lens  
Three tanks with plates were chlorinated at10 ppm for four hours.  Dechlorination was achieved 
with sodium thiosulphate and heavy aeration a days prior to the introduction of with U. lens .  
Aquasol was added at 80 mg/L.  Trace metals and iron stock solutions were prepared as for f/2 
medium (Guillard and Ryther, 1962) and added at 1 ml/L.  Sodium metasilicate (Laboratory 
Supply, cat. no. 26186) was added to tanks at 22.7 mg/L.
Ten U. lens seed plates, which were 2 months old with ∼60% cover, were placed between 
the baskets in 3 tanks.  Four days later there was a mass release of zoospores in all 3 tanks.  
Aeration was maintained to break up and disperse the aggregation of zoospores on the surface 
of the water.  The U. lens seed plates were removed from the tanks after 8 days.  After 10 days 
of the tanks remaining static, 1 μm filtered seawater, at a 20% per hour exchange rate was 
introduced to the tanks.  Aquasol was constantly pumped into the inflowing seawater to give 
a constant rate of Aquasol in a tank of 3.47 mg/L.  Abalone larvae were added to the tanks 
5 days after the introduction of fresh seawater.
Isolation and culturing of Navicula  sp.
A benthic diatom, Navicula  sp. was isolated from a SOM nursery plate (diatom isolated for 
Daume et al., 2000).  The Diatoms were cultured at 17 ± 2 ° C in f/2 medium, on a 12:12 L:D 
photo cycle from daylight fluorescent lamps.  A stock culture was maintained in an exponential 
phase on 25 cm2 tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Falcon 3014).  
The culture was non-axenic. The species could not be successfully cultured in suspension.  
However large-scale culture of this isolate was achieved by using progressively larger surface 
areas.  Three mls of the benthic culture was transferred from the bottom of a tissue culture flask 
into a Petri dish (150 cm2) containing 100 ml of f/2 using a pipette.  Four days later the Petri 
dish culture was brushed into a 1218 cm2 tray (Nally Ltd, IH009) with a clear fitted PVC lid.  
After a further 4 days the culture was brushed into a 1.3 m2 (30 L capacity) plastic sealed bag, 
which was laid horizontally.  The bag culture was harvested into a bucket after 5 days while 
the culture was in an exponential phase.  The harvested culture in the bucket was suspended 
by stirring.  
Inoculation of nursery plates with Navicula sp.
Three tanks with plates were chlorinated, dechlorination and nutrients added (see method 
above for U. lens  tanks).Appendix 2 cont.100                                                     Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                      101Ten L of the culture, with a density of 104 cells mL-1, was used to inoculate each of the three 
nursery tanks with plates.  The tanks remained static with low aeration for five days, followed 
by the introduction of 1 μm filtered seawater at a 20% per hour exchange rate.  Aquasol and 
sodium metasilicate pentahydrate were constantly pumped into the inflowing seawater (see 
method above for U. lens  tanks).  Abalone larvae were added to the tanks 7 days after the 
introduction of the seawater. 
Abalone larvae
Abalone larvae were obtained from the hatchery at SOM. Competence of the larvae to settle 
was defined by the development of the third tubule of the cephalic tentacle (Hahn, 1989; Seki 
& Kan-no; 1981a) and the observation that larvae started to explore the surface of the larval 
tank (Ebert & Houk, 1984). 
345,000 competent larvae were transferred to each of the 6 nursery tanks.  For the first 3 days 
the nursery tanks had 118 μm banjo sieves connected to the outlets and an exchange of 1.5% 
per hour of 1 μm filtered seawater with low aeration.  After the third day the water exchange 
rate was increased to a 20% per hour exchange rate with moderate aeration.  Seven days after 
the introduction of larvae the filtration was increased from 1 μm to 5 μm.  After two weeks the 
filtration was increased from 5 μm to only sand filtration ( ∼70 μm filtration).  
Nursery larval settlement 
The term “settlement” describes the permanent attachment of the larvae to the substrate after 
shedding of the velum to initiate metamorphosis. Furthermore, both peristomal shell-growth 
and ciliary processes in the mantle cavity indicated the initiation of metamorphosis (Hahn, 
1989). 
Seventy-two hours after the larvae were introduced to the tanks, three platelets from each tank 
were observed under a dissecting microscope. Six rectangles were randomly chosen from the 
grid of each platelet, and all settled larvae within the rectangles or overlapping on the bottom 
and left-hand lines were counted. 
Post-larvae growth
At the end of week 1 after the introduction of larvae, the number of post-larvae was reduced to 
6 on 3 platelets in each tank.  Those platelets were repeatedly used to measure the shell length 
of individual post-larvae at weekly intervals for 5 weeks.  The platelets remained submerged 
while being viewed under the microscope. 
Monitoring the biofilm
The same 3 platelets used in the growth trial were also used to record the density of Navicula  
sp., percentage coverage of  U. lens and the succession of the wild biofilm.  The biofilm on 
the platelets were sampled in 5 randomly chosen fields of view, at a magnification of 400x, at 
weekly intervals for 5 weeks.
Recruitment of post-larvae on the nursery plates
At week 6 after the introduction of larvae, the recruitment in each tank was estimated by 
counting the number of juvenile abalone on 4 randomly chosen plates in 4 randomly chosen 
baskets (a total of 16 plates/tank).100                                                     Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                      1012.2 Laboratory trial: settlement 
Four treatments, Navicula  sp., U. lens  + wild biofilm, Cylindrotheca closterium  and Cocconeis  
sp. were used in a laboratory settlement trial (diatom isolated for Daume et al., in print).  Six 
settlement substrata for each treatment were cut from clear PVC plates into 2 cm2 pieces.  Each 
of these plate pieces were placed into a 250 mL jar with 100 ± 5 larvae (same cohort as the 
nursery trial).  Navicula  sp. and U. lens  + wild biofilm  substrata were cut from spare platelets 
from the nursery trial.  C. closterium  and Cocconeis  sp. were cultured in the laboratory for 
5 days on 6 plate pieces each.  Six jars each with one plate piece, without a biofilm (clean 
plastic) were used as negative controls.  Six 1 cm2 pieces S. durum  were used as a positive 
control.  Settled larvae were counted under a dissecting microscope 24 hours after the larvae 
were added to the jars.
2.3 Data Analysis
ANOV A was used to test differences in the mean rate of settlement, shell growth and recruitment.  
Homogeneity of variance and normality were assessed by Cochran and Shapiro-Wilkes tests, 
respectively.  Nursery settlement data had one outlier replaced (1 rectangle out of 6 rectangles 
on one platelet, 3 platelets per tank) with the overall mean to achieve homogeneity of variance.  
A nested ANOV A (4 level) was performed where species represented fixed treatment effects and 
tanks, platelets and rectangles on the platelets random effects (chart 1). This gave the estimates 
of the variance between post-larvae settled per rectangle among species, among tanks within 
species, among platelets within tanks and within platelets.  Similarly growth data for week 
4 and 5 (average SL of the platelet) were tested using a nested ANOV A (3 level). Recruitment 
data required a logarithmic transformation to achieve homogeneity of variance before a 
nested ANOV A (3 level) was performed.  Laboratory settlement data required a logarithmic 
transformation to achieve homogeneity of variance before an ANOV A was undertaken.

3.1 Nursery Trial
Larvae settlement in the nursery
Seventy-two hours following the introduction of larvae to the nursery tanks, the U. lens + wild 
algae treatment had a greater settlement rate of abalone larvae at 34% ± 3.27 than Navicula sp. 
at 18% ± 2.54 (Figure 2).  However it was not statistically significant (p > 0.05, table 1) and 
there was no significant added variance from among tanks within treatments (p > 0.05).  There 
was significant platelet-to-platelet variation within tanks (p < 0.01).  In the U. lens  tanks the 
coefficient of variation (CV) for the settlement response was 71%, whereas in the Navicula  sp. 
tanks the CV was 103 %.  This indicates that the Navicula  sp. tanks had the greatest variation 
in the number of settlers on the platelets.

Post-larval growth
The growth rates from day 7 to day 21 were similar on the two treatments (Figure 3).  At day 
21 the mean shell length for the post-larvae feeding on U. lens  + wild algae and Navicula sp. 
was 987 μm ± 13.42 and 993 μm ± 10.93 ( ± S. E.) respectively.  Both treatments had a growth 
rate of 47 μm day-1 over the first 21 days.
The growth curves diverged between day 21 and day 28, as the post-larvae grazing on Navicula  
sp. had a peak in the growth rate to 64 μm day-1 between these days.  While those grazing on 
U. lens  + wild algae also had an increase in growth rate to 56 μm day-1 between days 21 day 
28. The net result was that the post-larvae grazing on Navicula  sp. had a significantly greater 
shell length at day 28 (p < 0.05).  There was no significant added variance among tanks within 
treatments (p > 0.05).102                                                     Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                      103At day 35, U. lens  + wild algae and Navicula  sp. treatments had mean shell lengths of 
1.76 mm ± 0.46 and 1.82 mm ± 0.43 ( ± S. E.) respectively, which was not significantly different 
(p > 0.05).  Furthermore there was no significant effect of tank-to-tank variation within 
treatments (p > 0.05) with respect to shell length.  From day 28 to day 35 both treatments had 
a growth rate of 55 μm day-1.  The growth trial was terminated at day 35 as the post-larvae 
started to migrate off the platelets at this stage of development.

Recruitment on plates at week 6
At week 6, the overall means for the number of post-larvae per side of a nursery plate for 
the U. lens  + wild algae and the Navicula  sp. treatments were 226 ±16 (± S.E.) and 73 ± 5 
respectively, which was significantly different (p < 0.01) (Figure 4).  
There was a significant effect of tank-to-tank variation within treatments (p < 0.05, table 4).  
The U. lens  + wild algae tanks 1, 2 and 3, resulted the number of post-larvae per side of a plate 
of 205 ± 24 (± S.E.), 185 ± 23, and 290 ± 32 respectively, which was not significantly different 
(p > 0.05, table 5).  While the Navicula  sp. tanks 4, 5 and 6, resulted in means of 88 ± 7, 
84 ± 10 and 49 ± 7 respectively.  The Navicula  sp. tank 6 was statistically significantly lower 
than both Navicula  sp. tanks 4 and 5 (p < 0.05).

U. lens  coverage and succession of wild algae
The day prior to the introduction of larvae, each U. lens  nursery plate exhibited two, 5 cm 
wide, clear streaks where the zoospores were unable to attach due to the aeration disturbance.  
Thus there was an uneven coverage of U. lens  over the entire plate, which included the platelet 
bolted to the centre. The platelets appeared to have a lower coverage of U. lens  compared to 
the entire plate as they were in the centre of the plates between the air-lines.  
The day prior to the introduction of larvae, the U. lens  tanks 1, 2, and 3 had an overall mean 
U. lens coverage of 13.8 ± 1.1 % ( ± S. E.) on the platelets.  The water exchange and the wild 
algae on the U. lens seed plates also resulted in the introduction of wild algae to the tanks.  
A small “needle” Nitzschia , colonies of cells attached with a mucous thread and a Navicula 
type diatom dominated the wild algae on the U. lens  platelets.  The mean number of wild algae 
cells on the platelets in the U. lens  tanks was 3.9 x103/cm2 ± 8.5 x102/cm2 (± S. E.).
The coverage of U. lens increased over the surface of the plates from 16% at week 1 to 22%
at week 5 (Table 6).  U. lens began to spawn in all three tanks between weeks 2 and 3.  
A succession of wild algae occurred around and over the developing U. lens .  
Navicula  sp. density and succession of wild algae
The day prior to the introduction of larvae, the three Navicula  sp. tanks 4, 5 and 6 appeared to 
have an even diatom film over the plates.  The overall mean number of Navicula  sp. cells on 
the platelets was 3.7 x 105/cm2 ± 2.3 x 104/cm2 (± S. E.).   Navicula  sp. was dominant in the 
biofilm and no other wild algae were apparent at sampling.
From week 1 to week 5, the Navicula sp. film in tanks 4 and 5, remained dominant over wild 
algae, as it was a very good “space competitor” (indicated by the high density of cells/cm2 
above).  However a wild alga contaminated the Navicula  sp. tank 6.  The wild alga had the 104                                                     Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                      105growth form of colonies of cells attached with a mucous thread to the platelets and was probably 
contaminated from an adjacent tank.  It appeared that this wild alga required relatively little 
space to attach to a plate, as only a mucous thread was required for attachment as opposed to 
solitary cells with a prostrate growth form.
Copepods
The density of Navicula  sp. decreased between week 4 and week 5 from x105 cells/cm2 to 
x102 cells/cm2.  The wild algae on the  U. lens  platelets also decreased in similar magnitude 
whereas the coverage of U. lens  increased. It was observed that the decrease in cell density 
coincided with a sharp increase in copepod numbers in all tanks. U. lens  was  apparently 
resistant to grazing by copepods.
3.2 Laboratory larval settlement
Navicula  sp., C. closterium  and Cocconeis  sp. treatments had mean cell densities of 1.4 x 
105/cm2 ± 4.2 x 103, 1.1 x 105/cm2 ± 3.8 x 104 and 7.6 x 104/cm2 ± 2.9 x 104 (± S. E.) respectively.  
The laboratory  U. lens treatment had a mean coverage of 19 ± 3% ( ± S. E.).
There was a significant difference between the numbers of settled post-larvae after 24 hours 
on the different treatments (p < 0.001) (Figure 5).  The two macroalgae treatments, U. lens +  
wild algae and S. durum  resulted in the greatest settlement rates, which were not significant 
different from each other (p > 0.05).  A significantly greater number of larvae settled on 
S. durum  compared to any of the diatom films (p < 0.05).  Excluding the positive control 
(S. durum ), the U. lens + wild algae nursery treatment resulted in the greatest settlement rate 
at 21%, however it was not significantly greater than Navicula  sp. nursery treatment or the 
Cocconeis  sp. (p > 0.05).  C. closterium  resulted in the lowest settlement rate among the 
diatom films (p < 0.01), which was not significantly different to the negative control (p > 0.05).  
The coefficient of variation for the two nursery conditioned treatments of Navicula  sp. and 
U. lens+ wild algae was 6% and 24% respectively.Appendix 2 cont.106                                                     Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                      107Fig. 5: Laboratory settlement response of Haliotis rubra  after 24 hours.

4.0 Discussion 
4.1 Larval settlement
This study used two treatments to condition nursery settlement plates, which reduced the reliance 
upon natural biofilms. The laboratory and nursery settlement trials clearly demonstrated that 
plates seeded with U. lens or inoculated with Navicula  sp. in a nursery environment possess 
positive inducer(s) for larvae settlement.  In the laboratory trial,  C. closterium  produced lower 
settlement than U. lens + wild algae or Navicula sp. treatments.  Clean plastic was a valid 
negative control.
In both the laboratory and nursery trials U. lens + wild algae had a greater settlement rate of 
abalone larvae than Navicula  sp. however it was not statistically significant in either trial.  
This statistically non-significant result may have been caused by the low statistical power 
(low platelet replication) and the large variability from platelet-to-platelet with a tank. Daume 
et al. (in print) demonstrated that settlement of larvae was significantly greater on U. lens 
compared to Navicula  sp. but that there was no significant difference between Navicula  sp. and 
the combination of U. lens /Navicula  sp.  These results suggest that the presence of diatoms on 
an U. lens  substrate may reduce settlement.  Furthermore these results may explain why there 
was no significant difference in settlement between U. lens  + wild algae and Navicula  sp. in 
this study, as the U. lens platelets had the addition of a wild algae, which included diatoms.  
The wild algae on the U. lens  platelets included a motile “needle” Nitzschia , Navicula type 
diatom and a three-dimensional growth form (colonies connected together by mucous thread).  
Excessive motility in a diatom hinders larvae settlement (Roberts, in print) and a high density 
of three-dimensional growth form results in larvae being unable to attach effectively to a 
substrate causing mortality prior to metamorphosis (Kawamura, 1996).  106                                                     Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                      107The development of the wild algae can be reduced by keeping the water exchange to a 
minimum and removing the wild algae from the U. lens  seed plates.  However the initial post-
larvae growth and survival on U. lens  with reduced diatoms at this initial stage in the nursery 
environment must be investigated.  The degree of coverage by U. lens  on the plates for high 
consistent larvae settlement also needs further investigation.  
4.2 Abalone Growth rates 
At day 28 a significant difference in shell length between the treatments was recorded, 
although the actual difference was small.  The diet of Navicula  sp. produced the greatest 
shell length of 1,439 μm ± 14 at day 28, with a growth rate of 64 μm day-1 between day 
21 to day 28.  Kawamura et al. (1998a) review of the feeding and growth of post-larval abalone 
generalised that post-larvae with shell length of 800-2,000 μm, that graze on highly digestible 
diatoms films, grow at about ∼40-60 μm day-1. Post-larvae grazing, however, on a poor diatom 
film (low “digestion efficiency”) will generally grow at ∼15-30 μm day-1 (Kawamura et al., 
1998a).  
At day 35 the mean abalone shell lengths for those on diets of U. lens + wild algae and Navicula  
sp. was 1,760 μm ± 46 and 1,820 μm ± 43 respectively, which was not significantly different. 
At day 35 there was no tank-to-tank variation with respect to the post-larvae shell length within 
either treatment.  Roberts et al. (1999) laboratory study found that H. iris post-larvae grew 
fastest on a diets of Cocconeis scutellum , Navicula ramosissima and Cylindrotheca closterium 
compared to diets of N. britannica  and Pleurosigma  sp. The three diets that produced the fastest 
growth achieved ∼1,500 μm at day 35 post-settlement.  In Daume et al. (in print) the diatom 
diet that resulted in the greatest post-larval growth rate produced a shell length of ∼1,400 μm 
at day 35 post-settlement. However caution is required when comparing shell length across 
cohorts, experimental designs and abalone species. Furthermore, growth rates in laboratory 
experiments may be lower than in flow through tanks (Roberts R., pers. comm.).  
In this nursery study it is difficult to identify which food item(s) resulted in the high growth 
rates achieved on the macroalgae U. lens + wild algae, as U. lens , U. lens  germlings and a wild 
algae were all present on the platelets.  U. lens  naturally spawned in all three tanks and U. lens  
germlings were first recorded  at day 21. In the laboratory post-larvae at > 2 mm were observed 
clearing U. lens  germlings from a substrate (pers. obser.).  It is hypothesised that germlings and 
younger U. lens  algae with new growth may be more suitable as a food source for post-larvae 
< 5 mm than well-developed U. lens .  
4.3 Recruitment
At week 6, the U. lens + wild algae treatment resulted in significantly greater numbers of 
post-larvae on the plates compared with the Navicula  sp. treatment.  Furthermore there was no 
tank-to-tank variation in the number of post-larvae on the plates in each of the three U. lens + 
wild algae tanks.  However across the Navicula sp. treatment there was tank-to-tank variation 
in the number of post-larvae across the three tanks. 
4.4 Implications for Aquaculture
In this study the full potential of Navicula  sp. to improve the growth rate of the post-larvae 
was not realised when compared to the U. lens  + wild algae treatment, as the extensive 
infrastructure in the nursery lacked the ability to control the copepod populations and a 
developing competitive algae.  These issues need to be addressed.Appendix 2 cont.108                                                     Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003 Fisheries Research Contract Report [Western Australia ] No. 3, 2003                                                      109Seeding with U. lens  in the nursery environment results in a settlement rate of 34 % of 
H. rubra  larvae.  The high growth rate on this treatment resulted in a shell length of ∼1.8 mm 
at the end of week 5.  The recruitment at week 6 was 226 post-larvae per side of a nursery 
plate.  Furthermore the U. lens  treatment did not result in tank-to-tank variation with respect 
to post-larvae settlement, shell growth or recruitment.  
Once the free “swimming” zoospores from U. lens  settle and germinate on a nursery plate, 
this macroalgae with a prostrate growth form increases in coverage over time. Furthermore the 
development of a wild algae does not appear to be inhibited around U. lens .  U. lens  appears 
to be resistant to copepod grazing and naturally re-spawns which continuously re-seeds the 
nursery tanks.  
Maintenance of adequate food is a limiting factor in the intensification of abalone nursery 
production due to grazing pressure of > 3 mm post-larvae and/or copepods (Farrell, S., pers. 
comm.).  Although > 3 mm post-larvae were outside the scope of this study, the presence of 
U. lens  on a nursery plate is seen as advantageous in increasing the carrying capacity of a 
plate (Farrell, S., pers. comm.).  The protocol to set up U. lens nursery tanks for settlement and 
feeding from dense mature seed plates requires limited labour and infrastructure.  However 
the role and value of the additional developing wild algae around U. lens  needs further 
investigation.
