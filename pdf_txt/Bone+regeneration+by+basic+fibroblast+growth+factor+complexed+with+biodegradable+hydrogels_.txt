Abstract
The objective of this study is to enhance the bone induction activity of basic Þbroblast growth factor (bFGF) for reconstruction of
skull bone defects which has been clinically recognized as almost impossible. For this purpose, we prepared biodegradable hydrogelsfrom gelatin with an isoelectric point of 4.9 which is capable of polyionic complexing with basic bFGF. When implanted in rabbit
skull defects of 6 mm in diameter (6 defects per experimental group), the gelatin hydrogels incorporating 100 lg of bFGF promoted
bone regeneration at the defect in marked contrast to free bFGF of the same dose, Þnally closing the bone defects after 12 weeks ofimplantation as is apparent from histological examination. In dual energy X-ray absorptometry analysis, the bone mineral density atthe skull defects enhanced by the hydrogels was signiÞcantly higher than that by free bFGF at doses ranging from 2 to 200 lg/defect
(P(0.05). The extent of bone regeneration induced by gelatin hydrogels incorporating 100 lg of bFGF increased with a decrease in
their water content. Histological examination indicated that more slowly degrading hydrogels of lower water content prolonged the
retention period of osteoblasts in the bone defects. This led to enhanced bone regeneration compared with faster degrading hydrogels
of higher water content. It was concluded that this biodegradable hydrogel system was a promising surgical tool to assistself-reconstruction of the skull bone. (1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved

1. Introduction
Gene technology has made possible the mass produc-
tion of bioactive proteins, but the half-life period ofproteins in the body is generally too short to e¤ectivelyexert the biological activity when they are injected in thefree form. One possible method to circumvent this prob-lem and enhance the in vivo e¦cacy is to release theproteins at the site of action over a long period of time. Itis well recognized that a bFGF molecule has a highbinding a¦nity for acidic polysaccharides in the extracel-lular matrix, e.g., heparin and heparan sulfate, probablyfor protection of bFGF from denaturation and enzy-matic degradation in vivo [1, 2]. Thus, based on this
inherent a¦nity of bFGF for acidic substances, we haveprepared a biodegradable hydrogel composed of alka-line-processed ÔacidicÕ gelatin with an isoelectric point(pI) of 4.9 which can ionically interact with bFGF. Thegelatin hydrogel was degraded in vivo and the degrada-bility could be controlled by altering the extent of gelatincrosslinking. The bFGF ionically complexed with theacidic gelatin was not released from the hydrogels underthe in vitro non-degradation conditions. It is possiblethat the hydrogels achieved the sustained release of bio-logically active bFGF as a result of hydrogel degrada-tion, resulting in signiÞcantly enhanced angiogenic e¤ectin marked contrast to free bFGF [3].
Thompson et al. reported that the release of acidic
FGF from gelatin was e¤ective in enhancing the neovas-cularization activity in vivo [4]. In addition to the an-giogenic e¤ect, it has been demonstrated that bFGF
0142-9612/98/$19.00 (1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
PIIS0142-9612(98)00233-0stimulates proliferation of osteoblastic cells [5, 6] and
enhances bone formation in the long bone of rats wheninjected intravenously in the solution form [7 Ð10]. How-
ever, little research on the combination of bFGF with itscarrier has been reported, although there is one reportwhich described that a mixture of demineralized bonematrix and bFGF was e¤ective in enhancing the boneformation in rat tibia [11]. These Þndings strongly sug-gest that if it is possible for bFGF to be localized andreleased at the site to be acted on for an extended timeperiod, e¦cient bone formation will be achieved.
The present study was undertaken to evaluate the
feasibility of our gelatin hydrogel system to enhancebFGF-induced osteogenetic e¤ect. Since the hydrogelsystem is a suitable for the localization and sustainedrelease of bFGF, it is highly expected for it to promotebone regeneration. bFGF-incorporating gelatin hydro-gels were applied to the skull defects of rabbits to evalu-ate their potent e¦cacy as the material to promote boneregeneration at the skull defects which is known to healmuch more slowly than long bone defects [12]. To ourknowledge, any biological action of bFGF on skull boneshas not yet been investigated. The skull bone regenera-tion induced by the bFGF-incorporating gelatin hydro-gels was compared with that induced by free bFGF andevaluated in terms of their bFGF dose and degradationrate. We also describe the time course of the number ofosteoblasts recruited in the skull defects during the pro-cess of bone regeneration.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Gelatin with a pI of 4.9 was prepared by the alkaline
treatment of bovine bone collagen with Ca(OH)2(Nitta
Gelatine Co., Osaka, Japan). It was named as acidicgelatin due to the acidic feature since the amide groups ofcollagen were converted to carboxyl groups through thealkaline process. The weight-average molecular weight ofthe acidic gelatin was 99,000 when measured by gelÞltration chromatography relative to standard poly(ethy-lene glycol) samples. Human recombinant bFGF withthe pI of 9.6 was kindly supplied from Kaken Pharma-ceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan. Other chemicals were pur-chased from Wako Pure Chemical Ltd., Kyoto, Japanand used without further puriÞcation.
2.2. Preparation of bFGF-incorporating gelatin hydrogels
Gelatin in 10 wt% aqueous solution was chemically
crosslinked with various amounts of glutaraldehyde at4¡C to prepare hydrogels with di¤erent extents of cross-
linking. Brießy, 4.5 ml of an aqueous gelatin solutioncontaining glutaraldehyde at the Þnal concentrations of2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 20.0, 30.0 and 100.0 m
Mwas cast into a Tef-
lon mold (5 ]5c m2, 1.8 mm depth). The crosslinking
reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 4 ¡C and the
crosslinked hydrogel sheets were immersed in 50 m M
glycine aqueous solution at 37 ¡C for 1 h to block residual
aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde. Following punchingout of the resulting hydrogel sheets to form into disc(6 mm in diameter), the hydrogel discs were rinsed bydouble-distilled water (DDW), 100% ethanol and auto-claved DDW to obtain the sterilized hydrogels. Thesterilized hydrogels were aseptically freeze-dried. No bigchange in hydrogel shape was observed before and afterfreeze drying. Impregnation of bFGF into the freeze-dried hydrogels was carried out by use of phosphate-bu¤ered saline solution (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 2, 10,20, 50, 100 and 200 lg of bFGF. bFGF-free, empty
gelatin hydrogels were prepared similarly except for us-ing bFGF-free PBS. 30 ll of PBS with or without bFGF
was impregnated into the dried hydrogels during theswelling process, irrespective of the water content ofhydrogels, because the volume of the bu¤er was muchless than that theoretically impregnated into each hydro-gel. Fig. 1 shows the light microscopic photograph ofbFGF-incorporating gelatin hydrogels and freeze-driedhydrogels before bFGF impregnation. The pore offreeze-dried hydrogels ranged from 20 to 60 lm. The size
of bFGF-incorporating gelatin hydrogel discs obtainedwas 6 mm in diameter and 1.8 mm thick, irrespective oftheir bFGF loading and water content. The bFGF load-ing of the hydrogel was indicated as the amount of bFGFadded in hydrogel swelling. The swollen hydrogels wereused for the following experiments.
As one method to evaluate the crosslinking extent of
gelatin hydrogels, their water content was measured. Thehydrogel weight before and after swelling at 37 ¡C in PBS
was determined to calculate the water content, which wasdeÞned by the weight percentage of water in the wethydrogel [3]. Gelatin hydrogels with the water contentsof 98, 95, 92 and 85% were used for the following animalexperiments. All experimental processes were done understerile conditions.
2.3. Animal experiment
Japanese white rabbits weighing 2.0 Ð2.5 kg were anes-
thetized by the intravenous administration of Nem-butal
'injection (Dainippon Pharamaceutical Co. Ltd.,
Osaka, Japan) which contains 50 mg of sodium pento-barbital, 0.4 ml of propylene glycol and 0.105 ml ofethanol per 1 ml of the solution (0.6 mlkg ~1body
weight). In addition, local analgesia was performed bysubcutaneous administration of 1% lidocaine solutioninto the subcutaneous tissue of rabbit heads (4 ml/head).The skin of rabbit heads was cut to expose their skullbone. After incision of the pericranium, the 2 skull defectsof 6 mm in diameter per rabbit were made symmetrically808 Y. Tabata et al. /Biomaterials 19 (1998) 807 Ð815Fig. 1.

4 mm far from the sagittal suture at the parietal bone
using a microdrill without injuring the underlying duramater. All these operative procedures were performed byuse of a surgical microscope. Institutional guidelines re-garding animal experimentation were followed. Gelatinhydrogels incorporating di¤erent amounts of bFGF andbFGF-free gelatin hydrogels were placed to the rabbitskull defect. As controls, 30 ll of PBS with or without
bFGF was applied to the skull defect. Six defects wererandomly selected from the right or left defect of di¤erentrabbit skulls and treated with bFGF-incorporating gela-tin hydrogels and other agents. Each experimental groupcomposed of 6 defects from 6 di¤erent rabbits. Prelimi-nary experiments demonstrated that bFGF treatment forone defect did not a¤ect bone response to the counterpartdefect, irrespective of the dosage form. The pericraniumand skin were carefully sutured with 4-0 nylon monoÞla-ments.
The animals were sacriÞced by intravenous adminis-
tration of sodium pentobarbital at an over-dose 4 daysand 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment. The skull bonewas drilled out together with the defects and Þxed in10 wt% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 4 days toassess the bone regeneration.
2.4. Assessment of bone formation and cell recruitment
Bone regeneration at the skull defect was assessed by
Dual Energy X-ray Absorptometry (DEXA) and his-tological examinations. The bone mineral density (BMD)of each defect was measured by DEXA utilizing a bonemineral analyzer (Dichroma Scan 600, Aloka Co., Tokyo,Japan) at 4 days and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks aftertreatment with or without bFGF. The instrument wascalibrated with a phantom of known mineral content.Each scan was performed at a speed of 20 mms ~1and
the scanning length was 1 mm. DEXA measurement wasperformed for 6 defects per each experimental group andthe region of interest (ROI) for each defect was5]5m m2.
Bone specimens were demineralized in 10 wt% EDTA
solution at 4 ¡C for 3 days, embedded in para¦n and
sectioned at 10 lm in thickness. The sections were pre-
pared to cut as near as the center of the skull defect andstained with hematoxylin Ðeosin (HE) at 4 days and 1, 2,
4, 8 and 12 weeks post-implantation. The histologicalsections were viewed at a high magniÞcation of 400 ]by
a light microscope to count the number of osteoblasts inan active form according to the method reported byNakamura et al. [10]. Measurements were performed atfour squared-shaped areas (0.6 ]0.6 mm) including the
edge of bone defects per one histological section.The area was randomly selected along the edge of bonenewly formed around the margin of the defect hole.Six di¤erent sections were measured for each experi-mental group. The number of osteoblasts, being char-acterized by basophilic cuboided cytoplasm locatingadjacent to the bone surface [13], was counted in eacharea. The bone edge perimeter in each area was measuredusing an image analyzer (SP-1000, Olympus, Tokyo,Japan) under a light microscope. The resulting cellnumber per perimeter was calculated from the data of 16independent areas.
2.5. Statistical analysis
All the data were analyzed by StudentsÕ t-test to assess
statistical signiÞcance between experimental groups. Ex-perimental results were expressed as means $standard
error.Y. Tabata et al. /Biomaterials 19 (1998) 807 Ð815 809Fig. 2. The inßuence of glutaraldehyde concentration on the water

3. Results
3.1. Characterization of bFGF-incorporating gelatin
hydrogels
Figure 2 shows the relationship between the water
content of gelatin hydrogels and the concentration ofglutaraldehyde used in the hydrogel preparation. It isapparent that the water content of gelatin hydrogelsdecreased with an increase in the glutaraldehyde con-centration. It is obvious that the higher glutaraldehydeconcentration, the higher the crosslinking extent of hy-drogels prepared. Because there is no good method avail-able for directly determining the extent of crosslinking,we regarded the water content of hydrogels as an experi-mental parameter reßecting their crosslinking extent. Inthe present study, four types of hydrogels with di¤erentwater contents were used. Glutaraldehyde is a crosslink-ing agent which is allowed to chemically crosslink be-tween amino groups of gelatin molecules. It is possiblethat the crosslinked gelatin hydrogel is degraded throughenzymatic cleavage of gelatin molecules rather thanthrough their simple hydrolysis. The higher the extent ofhydrogel crosslinking, the less enzyme accessibility togelatin for cleavage, leading to a reduced hydrogel degra-dation. Indeed, in the enzyme present in vivo, it wasfound that chemically crosslinked gelatin Þlms of lowerwater content were degraded more slowly than those ofhigher water content [14]. The degradation period ofhydrogels could be regulated by changing the crosslink-ing extent and four types of hydrogels were degraded inthe skull defect over the time range from 2 weeks to4 months, irrespective of the bFGF impregnation. The
shape and size of hydrogel discs did not change by thebFGF impregnation process, irrespective of their bFGFloading and water content.
3.2. Histological e valuation
Figure 3 shows histological sections of the skull defects
12 weeks after treatment under di¤erent conditions. In-signiÞcant bone regeneration and remarkable ingrowthof soft connective tissues at the defect were observed forrabbits when treated with PBS, empty gelatin hydrogelsand free bFGF (Fig. 3A ÐC). bFGF-free gelatin hydrogels
neither induced bone formation nor interfered with boneregeneration at the skull defect. On the contrary, theskull defect of rabbits treated with gelatin hydrogelsincorporating 100 lg of bFGF was Þlled with a newly
regenerated bone tissue and almost closed at 12 weeksafter implantation. Comparison of Fig. 3E with Fig. 3Frevealed that osteoblasts were seen in an active formaround the edge of bone treated with bFGF-incorporat-ing hydrogels in contrast to free bFGF treatment. InFig. 3F, tissue around the bone edge of defect treatedwith bFGF-incorporating hydrogel composed of wovenbone, whereas the free bFGF-treated tissue composed oflamellar bone (Fig. 3E). This histological examinationindicates that in the former tissue, bone regeneration wasin progress even after 12 weeks of treatment. However,the regeneration process had already been over in thelatter tissue and the tissue returned to originally staticappearance. No cartilaginous tissues were histologicallyobserved during the process of bone formation by bFGF-incorporating gelatin hydrogels. Bone regenerationinduced by the hydrogel-incorporating bFGF was notinitiated from the central portion of the defect but fromthe edge.
3.3. Mineral deposition at skull defects
Table 1 summarizes results of the BMD measurement
for the skull defects of rabbits 8 and 12 weeks afterdi¤erent treatments. The BMD of intact rabbit skulls was120$10 mg cm ~2. As is seen, the results are in good
agreement with the photographs in Fig. 3. It is clear thatthe bFGF-incorporating gelatin hydrogel enhanced sig-niÞcantly the BMD of skull defect, both for the hydrogelsof water contents of 85 and 98%. BMD was signiÞcantlyhigher for rabbits treated with the 85% hydrogel than the98% one. On the other hand, free bFGF did not exhibitany signiÞcant bone regeneration, although the BMDtended to be somewhat high compared with that ofPBS-treated, control rabbits. The BMD at the defect ofrabbits treated with bFGF-free, empty gelatin hydrogelswas similar to that of control rabbits, indicating thatimplantation of the hydrogels in the defect did not dis-turb bone regeneration at the site. A similar trend was

observed for bone formation 8 weeks after implantation,
although the e¦cacy of the bFGF-incorporating hydro-gels in enhancing bone regeneration was not as clear asthat of hydrogels implanted for 12 weeks. The BMDvalues ranged from 50.8 to 55.6, 50.2 to 58.3, 60.3 to 67.3,and 76.4 to 92.5 mg cm ~2at 4 days and 1, 2 and 4 weeks
after treatment, respectively, no signiÞcant di¤erence inthe BMD being observed between experimental groups.
Figure 4 shows the e¤ect of bFGF dose on the bone
formation induced by free bFGF and bFGF-incorporat-ing gelatin hydrogels. Apparently, incorporation of
bFGF in gelatin hydrogels was e¤ective in enhancingbone formation at the skull defect. bFGF-incorporatinggelatin hydrogels signiÞcantly enhanced the BMD ofskull defect over the bFGF dose range studied. On theother hand, free bFGF did not exhibit any signiÞcantbone regeneration except for the highest dose thatproduced a somewhat high BMD compared with thatof rabbits treated with PBS and empty gelatinhydrogels.Y.

It is again seen that incorpora-tion of bFGF in the gelatin hydrogels enhanced theBMD at the skull bone defect to a signiÞcantlyhigh extent compared with free bFGF, irrespectiveof their water content. However, the BMD enhance-ment depended on the water content of bFGF-incorpor-ating gelatin hydrogels; the hydrogels of lower watercontent showed higher BMD than those of higher watercontent.3.4.

rabbits after di¤erent treatments. Interestingly, during
the initial 2 weeks, the time course of cell number wassimilar among di¤erently treated rabbits. In histologicalexamination, no di¤erence between the rabbit groupstreated with free bFGF and bFGF-incorporatinggelatin hydrogels was observed in the distributionproÞle and the number of the cells which was positivelystained with alkaline phosphatase during the initial 1and 2 weeks. The proÞle of the cell number thereafterdepended on the treatment type. The osteoblast numberincreased up to 2 weeks and then decreased for both therabbit groups treated with PBS and empty gelatin hydro-gels. No di¤erence in the time proÞle of osteoblastnumber was observed between empty gelatin hydrogelswith di¤erent water contents (data not shown).Free bFGF treatment prolonged the retention period ofcells by a few weeks, but the number returned to thebasal level on week 8. On the contrary, the rabbitgroups treated with bFGF-incorporating gelatin hydro-gels did not exhibit the decrease in the cell numberas rapid as that of free bFGF treatment, retaining asigniÞcantly high level of cell number over the timerange studied, irrespective of the hydrogel type.However, the retention period of the enhanced cell leveltended to prolong with a decrease in the hydrogel watercontent.4. Discussion
The ability of skull bones to regenerate by themselves
is recognized to be much lower than that of long bones[12]. If this is true, closure of a ßat bone defect witha newly formed bone would be practically impossible,unless protein factors capable of strongly di¤erentiatingimmature cells into osteoblastic cells, such as bone mor-phogenetic protein (BMP) [15] and transforming growthfactor- b1 (TGF- b1) [16], are provided. In fact, the com-
bination of BMP with a matrix was found to be e¤ectivein Þlling experimental bone defects of animals [17 Ð19],
although few studies have been reported on primateswith promising results [20]. bFGF is a growth factorto trigger proliferation of capillary endothelial cells inaddition to osteoblasts [21], unlike BMP. Weiss et al.reported that bFGF stimulated the cells involved in osteo-genesis and angiogenesis in a vascularized bone graft [22].Indeed, angiogenesis was observed around the skull de-fect of bFGF-treated rabbits during the initial period.Although bFGF does not have such a strong activity forcell di¤erentiation as BMP, the present study clearlydemonstrates that combination with a good carrier en-ables bFGF to enhance its osteogenic function, leadingto closure of a skull defect. Animal experiments with
125I-labeled bFGF or gelatin demonstrated that the
retention period of bFGF in the body was in goodaccordance with that of gelatin, indicating that bFGF isreleased as a result of in vivo degradation of the hydrogelmatrix [23]. This sustained release of bFGF from thegelatin hydrogel will result in enhanced bone regenera-tion of skull defects.
Histological and DEXA examinations demonstrated
that bFGF-free gelatin hydrogels did not exhibit anyinherent properties to promote and interfere with boneregeneration (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The highly orderedstructure of collagen is known to play an important rolein the calciÞcation process [24]. Thus, it is unlikely thata denatured collagen, gelatin positively functions in boneformation. All types of implanted gelatin hydrogels weredegraded with time Þnally to completely disappear fromthe defective site 12 weeks after implantation, althoughthe degradation rate depended on their water content. Itis possible that soft tissues grew into the defect to Þll thedead space formed with hydrogel degradation. If thehydrogels are degraded at a rate lower than that of bonegrowth, the bone regeneration at the skull defect will bephysically interfered with the hydrogel. Such an interfer-ence was not observed for the most slowly degradinghydrogels with the water content of 85%. The thresholdperiod of hydrogel degradation to start interfering boneregeneration is unclear at present.
bFGF-incorporating gelatin hydrogels of lower water
content showed higher BMD than those of higher watercontent (Fig. 5). Slower degradation of the hydrogels isundoubtedly due to a larger extent of crosslinking. Since
Y. Tabata et al. /Biomaterials 19 (1998) 807 Ð815 813bFGF is released from the gelatin hydrogels as a result of
gelatin biodegradation, slower degradation of the hydro-gels will prolong the release period of bFGF, resulting inmore enhanced BMD.
It should be noted that bFGF-incorporating gelatin
hydrogels of lower water content maintained the in-creased cell level for a longer period than those of higherwater content. This can be explained in terms of bFGFrelease. The hydrogels of lower water content will bedegraded more slowly, leading to in vivo bFGF releasefor a longer time period. This prolonged bFGF releasepossibly gives a continuous stimulus to osteoblast prolif-eration which is responsible for the prolonged retentionof the osteoblast number at a high level (Fig. 6). We,therefore, believe that the di¤erent cell numbers lead tothe di¤erent BMD among the bFGF-incorporating gela-tin hydrogels with various water contents (Fig. 5). Sucha feature of bFGF-incorporating hydrogels must haveenhanced and retained the bFGF activity for bone regen-eration, e¤ectively Þlling the bone defect of rabbit skullwith the newly formed bone.
Bone regeneration induced by the hydrogel incorpor-
ating bFGF was not initiated from the central portionof the defect but from the edge. This is probably be-cause the precursor cells of osteoblasts are necessaryto initiate bone formation. It is well recognized thatthe precursor cells mainly exist in the periosteum andare di¤erentiated into osteoblasts to induce bone forma-tion [25]. In this case, osteoblastic cells positivelystainable with alkaline phosphatase, were not observedin the central portion of the skull defect but alongthe defect margin, resulting in bone regeneration fromthe bone edge, which is similar to that observed forcarrier matrices combined with other osteoinductivegrowth factors [17, 26, 27].
5. Conclusions
Gelatin hydrogels incorporating bFGF enhanced
bone regeneration in rabbit skull defects, Þnally clos-ing the defects whereas free bFGF was ine¤ective.The enhanced bone regeneration induced by the hydro-gels depended on their degradation rate. More slowlydegrading hydrogels achieved in vivo long-term bFGFrelease and retained osteoblasts number high in thebone defects for a long period, leading to enhancedbone regeneration compared with faster degradinghydrogels.
