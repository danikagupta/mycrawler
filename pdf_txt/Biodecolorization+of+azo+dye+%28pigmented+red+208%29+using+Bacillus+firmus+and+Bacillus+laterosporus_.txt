Industrial effluents contain a significant amount of 
residual synthetic dyes. For example food, pharmaceutical, 
cosmetic, printing, leather and textile industries. 
Uncontrolled discharge of t hese dye effluent in aqueous 
ecosystems leads to the reduction in sunlight penetration 
which in turn decrease photosynthetic activity, dissolved 
oxygen concentration, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 
chemical oxygen demand (COD), water quality and are leth al 
to resident organisms [1,2].  
In addition, many dyes are believed to be toxic 
carcinogenic or to be prepared from known carcinogens such 
as benzidine or other aromatic compounds that might be 
formed as a result of microbial metabolism [3,4]. Therefore, 
removal of such dyes before discharging them into natural 
water streams is essential. For this, appropriate treatment 
technologies are required. Traditional physical and chemical 
methods used for removal of dyes in wastewater are 
generally expensive; becaus e of their limited applicability 
and the production activated sludge, the newer treatment 
technologies need to be investigated. But, bioremediation has 
been proved to be applicable alternative for detoxification 
and degradation of dye effluents due to the cheap, 
environmentally friendly, and publicly acceptable alternative 
[6] to the physico -chemical methods [5]. In this context, a 
wide variety of microorganisms 
 
such as bacteria, actinomycetes, algae and fungi found in soil 
and water are able to decoloriz e synthetic dyes [6 -8]. 
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of microbial decolorization 
depends on the adaptability and the activity of selected 
microorganisms. Although it has been reported that various 
fungi could removed the synthetic dyes, bacteria are 
preferred due to their relatively short life cycle and faster 
decolorization process [9,10]. It has been reported that, many 
bacteria belonging to genera such as Bacillus  [11], 
Pseudomonas  [12], Aeromonas  [13] and Staphylococcus  [10], 
can be decolorized of sy nthetic dyes under aerobic and/or 
anaerobic conditions in natural characteristic, On the other 
hand, environmental conditions on dye removal such as pH 
[14,15], temperature [12,14], presence or absence of oxygen 
[16] and presence of additional C and N sour ces [17]  is great 
of importance.  
Denizli is one of the textile centers of Turkey. As a result 
of widespread textile industries in Denizli, there is a large 
amount of effluents loaded with dyes. In this background, the 
present study was designed to unders tand the decolorization 
ability of Bacillus  sp. DT16 isolated from textile effluents 
from Denizli. We describe an optimization process and its 
behavior under different conditions of pH, temperature, 
initial dye concentration, and different C and N sources on 
the microbial decolorization of textile dyes Reactive Violet 
5R (RV -5R) and Remazol Brillant Orange 3R (RBO -3R) by

 Abstract   
Dye pollution in water and soil is increasing rapidly depending on the industrialization.  Synthetic dyes are mutagenic, toxic and resistant 
to degradation due to their complex chemical structures so their effluents cannot be directly discharged. The bio logical remediation of textile 
effluents has recently received an increasing attention, representing an attractive, cheap, environmentally friendly, and pub licly acceptable 
alternative to the physico -chemical methods. Microorganisms play an important role in the decolorization and removal of dyes from polluted 
sites.  
In this study, decolorization of RV -5R and RBO -3R by Bacillu s sp. which was isolated from textile effluent was investigated. The effect of 
environmental factors such as pH (5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0) temperature (20, 30, 37 and 42 °C), carbon (1 g/L: sucrose, glucose, starch 
and mannitol) and nitrogene sources (ammonium chloride, peptone and yeast extract) and initial dye concentration (10, 25, 50,  100, 200, 500 
mg/L) on the microbial dec olorization by Bacillus  sp. was investigated.  
The maximum dye removal was obtained at 500 mg/L initial dye concentration for RV -5R and 200 and 500 mg/L for RBO -3R by the 
bacterium.  Bacterial decolorization of RV -5R was 54.54% (6h) in growth medium contain ing yeast extract (1g/L) and glucose (1g/L) at pH 
10.0 and 37 °C.  The same bacterium decolorized the RBO -3R dye at 96.15% (172 h) in growth medium containing peptone (1g/L) and sucrose 
(1g/L) at pH 10.0 and 30 °C.   
Any report about the microbial decoloriz ation of the RV -5R and RBO -3R dyes has not been seen in the literature. Therefore this study was 
the first report about the bacterial decolorization of these dyes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Dye stock  
The industrial quality Reactive Violet 5R (RV -5R) and 
Remazol Brillant Orange 3R (RB O-3R) dyes stock solution 
was obtained from Dystar Textile Co., Turkey. The powdered 
dyestuff was dissolved in distilled water at 1000 mg/L (w/v) 
and sterilized by filter for the preparation of dye stock. 
Appropriate volumes of the stock dye were added to growth 
medium containing flasks.  
 
Bacterial growth  
The bacterial strain ( Bacillus  sp. DT16) used in the 
present work was obtained from the culture collection of the 
Pamukkale University, Bacteriology Laboratory that was 
isolated from textile effluent. The  strain was inoculated to a 
250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml Nutrient Broth 
(NB; g/l: Beef extract 1, peptone 5, yeast extract 2, NaCl 5) 
medium and the culture was aerobically incubated with 
constant shaking at 125 rpm; culture growth was monitor ed 
by measuring optical density (OD) at 600 nm.  
 
Decolorization experiments  
The experiments were performed in 250 ml Erlenmeyer 
flasks containing decolorization medium (NB). The dyes RV -
5R and RBO -3R were added to the medium and 10% (w/v) 
bacterium ( Bacill us sp. DT16) was inoculated into the 
medium. After incubation, the samples were withdrawn at 
different time intervals and analyzed for decolorization  
efficiency. The aliquot was centrifuged at 14000 rpm to 
separate the bacterial cell mass. The decolorizati on rate was 
monitored spectrophotometrically by reading the decrease in 
absorbance (595 nm) of the dye in culture supernatant. 
Decolorizing activity is expressed in terms of percentage 
decolorization.  
The effect of environmental factors such as initial dy e 
concentration (10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 mg/L), carbon 
sources (1 g/L: sucrose, glucose, starch and mannitol), pH 
(5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0), temperature (20, 30, 37 and 
42 °C) and nitrogen sources (ammonium chloride, peptone 
and yeast extract ) on bacterial decolorization were 
investigated for the specify the optimum conditions. Nitrogen 
sources were added at different rates in the growth medium 
containing glucose. The rate of C/N was 1/1 and 1/0.5. Also, 
the growth of cells was routinely monit ored by measuring 
optical density (OD) at 600 nm. The experiments were 
performed in duplicate and the mean values were taken into 
account.  
 
Determination of decolorization efficiency  
Decolorization extent was determined by measuring the 
absorbance of the c ulture supernatant at 560 nm for RV -5R 
and 494 nm for RBO -3R using a UV -Vis Lange DR5000 
spectrophotometer. The decolorization efficiency was 
calculated using the following equation:  
 
Decolorization efficiency (%) = 100x (ODi - ODt) / ODi  
 
Where ODi refers to the initial absorbance at 560 and 494 
nm and ODt refers to the absorbance measured in the 
degradation. The percentage of decolorization was measured 
at different time intervals. All decolorization experiments 
were performed in duplicate. Abiotic control s (without 
microorganisms) were always included.  
  RESULTS  
  
Effect of initial dye concentration  
To determine the best decolorization ability of Bacillus 
sp. DT16 on RV -5R and RBO -3R, six different dye 
concentrations (10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 mg/L) we re 
used. Decolorization rate of RBO -3R and RV -5R by Bacillus  
sp. DT16 generally increase depending on the increase in the 
concentration of dye. The maximum decolorization time for 
500 mg/L of RBO -3R and RV -5R dye was 107th (43.61%) 
and 83th (49.12%) hours respectively (Data not given).

Effect of carbon sources  
 The effects of carbon s ources such as sucrose, glucose, 
starch and mannitol on decolorization by Bacillus  sp. DT16 
were tested; results are given in Fig. 1. Among the carbon 
sources used in the study, starch and glucose enhanced the 
decolorization rate of RV -5R (Fig. 1a). The ma ximum 
decolorization rate for 500 mg/L of RV -5R was 49.12% (83 
h) and 42.59% (131 h). On the other hand, among the carbon 
sources used in the study, glucose and mannitol enhanced the 
decolorization rate of RBO -3R (Fig. 1b). But interestingly, 
other carbon sources (sucrose and starch) were not positive 
effect on decolorization of RBO -3R by DT16. At glucose and 
mannitol containing medium of 500 mg/L dye concentration, 
maximum color reduction was observed at 43.61% (107 h) 
and 40.35% (83 h) respectively.  
 
Effect of pH  
Fig. 2 shows the effect of the different pH values of the 
medium on the bacterial decolorization containing 500 mg/L 
initial dye concentration. To determine suitable pH value for 
the most efficient decolorization by DT16, pH 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 
8.0, 9. 0 and 10.0 were tested. Bacterial decolorization of RV -

5R was 63.33% in growth medium containing glucose at pH 
10.0 and 57.38% in growth medium containing starch at pH 
8.0 (Fig. 2a). Also, bacterial decolorization of RBO -3R was 
55.83% in growth medium cont aining glucose at pH 10.0 
(Fig. 2b).

Effect of temperature  
 To determine the effect  of different temperature on 
decolorization, DT16 bacteria were inoculated into the NB 
medium containing 500 mg/L dye and 1g/L glucose at pH 
10.0 and incubated at 20, 30, 37 and 42°C. And the 
maximum decolorization for RV -5R was observed at pH 10.0 
and 37 ºC with the 63.33% of color reduction. On the other 
hand, the maximum decolorization of other dye (RBO -3R) 
was observed at pH 10.0 and 30°C with the 57.77% of color 
reduction (Fig. 3).

 Effect of carbon/nitrogen rate  
The effect of the carbon/nitrogen rate such as 
glucose/amonium chloride (1/0.5 and 1/1), glucose/peptone 
(1/0.5 and 1/1) and glucose /yeast extract (1/0.5 and 1/1) on 
decolorization by DT16 were tested; results are given in Fig. 
4. Bacterial decolorization of RV -5R was 54.54% (6h) in 
growth medium containing glucose (1g/L) and yeast extract 
(1g/L) at pH 10.0 and 37°C. The same bacterium  decolorized 
the RBO -3R dye at 96.15% (172h) in growth medium 
containing glucose (1g/L) and peptone (1g/L) at pH 10.0 and 
30°C (Fig. 4).

RBO -3R) 
 
DISCUSSION  
 
Environmental factors such as pH, dye concentration, 
carbon sources, and temperature is very important for 
bioremediation and detoxification of environmental  
contaminants. So, optimal environmental conditions should 
be determined to obtain efficient decolorization potential. 
This study revealed the potential of RV -5R and RBO -3R 
dyes removal by the bacterium Bacillus  sp. DT16 and 
determined the effect of enviro nmental factors on bacterial 
decolorization.  
Many of bacterial strains require organic carbon sources, 
as they cannot utilize dye as the growth substrate [18]. P. 
aeruginosa  was decolorized a commercial tannery and textile 
dye, Navitan Fast blue S5R in the  presence of glucose under 
aerobic conditions [19]. There are only very few bacteria that 
are able to grow on azo compounds as the sole carbon source 
20 [20].  Therefore the bacterial decolorization showed 
differences when the isolate DT16 was grown in the  presence 
of various types of carbon sources with 500 mg/L dye (RV -
5R and/or RBO -3R). The presence of starch and glucose in 
the culture medium resulted with high decolorization 
(49.12% and 42.59%  respectively) according to mannitol and 
sucrose for RV -5R (F ig. 1a). On the other hand, the best 
decolorization was obtained for RBO -3R dye in the presence 
of glucose and mannitol (43.61% and 40.35% respectively) 
(Fig. 1b). Similarly, in another study, glucose, sucrose, and 
glycerol were found as effective electron  donors while 
acetate, citrate, and lactate were unfavorable electron donors 
for AQDS (anthraquinone -2, 6-disulphonate, humus analog) 
reduction by Planococcus  sp. MC01 humus -reducing 
facultative anaerobe strain. Also this bacterium showed high 
decolorizing  activity of Orange I at the optimal glucose 
concentration [21].

The initial pH of the medium is an important effect on the 
efficiency of dye decolorization. In the present study, the 
effect of pH variation on decolorization at pH levels of 5.5, 
6.5, 7.5, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 was carried out in the growth 
medium with 500 mg/L dye containing glucose and/or starch 
which were the best effective C sources. The decolorization 
potential of bacterial strain DT16 was strongly affected from 
pH change (Fig. 2).  Bacillu s sp. DT16 decolorized the RV -
5R at the rate of 63.33%, at pH 10.0 in the growth medium 
containing glucose (Fig. 2a). However, at pH 6.0, 8.0 and 9.0 
color removal rates of RV -5R dye was 31.42, 23.08, 28.85, 
18.0 and 42.59% respectively. Also, maximum deco lorization 
of RBO -3R dye was observed at pH 10.0 (55.83%) in the 
growth medium with glucose too (Fig. 2b).  
Many studies have investigated the optimum pH values 
for bacterial reduction of synthetic dye. Cao et al. [22] 
reported that the influence of pH on the decolorization of dye 
mixture at pH 5.5 -8.0. And they observed that a sharp 
decrease in decolorization rate when pH was decreased to 
below pH 6.0. Shewanella oneidensis  MR-1 almost lost its 
decolorization ability at pH 5.5. In Citrobacter  sp. CK3 
optim um pH is 6.0 and 7.0 for decolorization of Reactive Red 
180 and much lower decolorization was observed in strongly 
acidic (at pH 4.0) and strongly alkaline (at pH 12.0) 
conditions [23].  
Fig. 3 shows the effect of temperature on decolorization 
of RV -5R and  RBO -3R by DT16 bacterium in the growth 
medium with 500 mg/L dye containing glucose at pH 10.0 
which was the best pH level. The decolorization potential 
was not very different at 20, 30, 37 and 42 ºC. However, the 
color removal rate at 37 ºC (63.33%) sligh tly higher than 30 
ºC (62.26%) for RV -5R.  On the other hand, the maximum 
rate of decolorization was 57.77% at 30 ºC for RBO -3R. It is 
necessary to determine the optimum temperature in different 
bacterial cultures in order to obtain maximum bacterial 
decol orization. For example S. oneidensis  MR-1 exhibited 
the maximum decolorization efficiency for dye mixture at 35 
ºC [22]. Wang et al. [23] reported that Citrobacter  sp. CK3 
showed strong decolorizing activity from 27 ºC to 37 ºC and 
at 42 ºC decolorization activity was decreased. Another 
bacteria Pseudomonas  sp. RA20 efficiently decolorized the 
Reactive Black -5 at 25 ºC [24].  
At optimal conditions for Bacillus  sp. DT16 bacterium, 
the maximum reduction of 500 mg/L of RBO -3R occurred 
with the rate of 96.15%: I nitial pH; 10.0, temperature; 30 °C, 
glucose/peptone rate; 1/1 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the removal 
rate of other dye RV -5R was generally decreased in the 
presence of all three nitrogen sources.  
 
CONCLUSION  
 
The obtained results exhibited that Bacillus  sp. strain 
isolated from textile effluent, effectively decolorized RBO -
3R (96.15%) and RV -5R (63.33%) dyes under optimal 
environmental conditions (pH, temperature, dye 
concentration, carbon and nitrogen sources).
