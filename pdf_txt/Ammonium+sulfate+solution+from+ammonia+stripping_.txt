Abstract   
The efficiency of ammonia removal from fresh source- segregated domestic food waste 
digestate using biogas as a stripping agent was studied in batch experiments at 35, 55 
and 70 ⁰ C, at gas flow rates of  0.125 and 0.250 L
biogas min-1 L-1
digestate  with and w ithout 
pH adjustment. Higher temperatures and alkaline conditions were required for effective ammonia removal, and at 35 ⁰ C with or without pH adjustment or 55 ⁰ C with 
unadjusted pH there was little or no removal. Results were compared to those from 
earlier studies with digestate that had been stored prior to stripping and showed that ammonia removal from fresh digestate was more difficult, with time constants 1.6 to 5.7 times higher than those previously reported. This has implications for the design of large-scale systems where continuous stripping of fresh digestate is likely to be the 
normal operating mode . A mass balance approach showed that thermal -alkaline 
stripping improved hydrolysis.   Keywords: Ammonia removal; hydrolysis; biogas stripping; anaerobic digestion; food waste

Source segregated domestic food waste (SS -DFW) represents a large biomass 
waste stream : stabilisation of this by anaerobic digestion  (AD)  can help towards 
meeting environmental protection targets such as the EU Directive on the landfilling of 
waste (1999/31/EC) . Further added value benefits are the recovery of a fuel gas  and the 
provision of a mechanism by which nutr ients can be recycled back to land through 
digestate application . Although anaerobic digestion can offer  numerous benefits ( EC, 
2010) , the digestion of SS -DFW can also present operational difficulties,  primarily due 
to its high protein content. Hydrolysis of this material releases  free and ionised 
ammonia : the latter is essential for the growth of anaerobic microorganisms , but both 
forms can be inhibitory to the anaerobic consortium , including methanogenic Archaea , 
and e specially to the acetoclastic methanogens (Angelidaki and Ahring, 1993; 
Kayhanian, 1999; Liu and Sung, 2002; Schnürer  and Nordberg, 2008 ). Partial inhibition 
of methanogenesis can cause operational instability due to volatile fatty acid (VFA) 
accumulation, leading to a decrease in biogas production, and in the worst cases to failure of the digestion process ( Angelidaki and Ahring, 1993; Poggi -Varaldo et  al., 
1997; Hansen et al., 1998 ). 
 
 Banks et al . (2012) showed that , given appropriate trace element 
supplementation to stimulate acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, mesophilic AD of SS -DFW could be achieved without reducing the total ammonia 
nitrogen (TAN) concentration by water addition . More recent work (VAL ORGAS , 
2013) has shown that with this trace element  supplementation, operation at TAN 
concentrations  above 6 g N L
-1 and an organic loading rate ( OLR ) up to 8 g VS L-1 day-1 
is possible with  no loss in digestion performance. An increase in temperature to the 
thermophilic range , however, leads to an increase in the ratio of free ammonia nitrogen  
(FAN) to TAN  from 11 % to 28 % , which in turns reduces  the threshold of ammonia 
toxic ity, and thus thermophilic d igestion of SS- DFW is unstable. This was clearly 
demonstrated in a c ompar ative study by Yirong et al. (2013a)  which showed the onset 
of failure in thermophilic SS- DFW digesters wh en TAN concentration s reached 3.0 g N 
L-1. A parallel study with acclimatisation to thermophilic conditions using a low 
nitrogen (1.45 % of dry weight) synthetic food waste showed long -term stable operation  
was possible in thermophilic conditions , while subsequent increases in the nitrogen 
concentration by addition of urea  to this  feedstock confirmed  that the  critical TAN 
concentration was between 2.5- 3.0 g N L-1 (Yirong et al., 2013b; VALORGAS, 2013) , 
equivalent to FAN concentrations of 590- 710 mg N L-1 at the operational pH. This 
threshold value is similar to that reported in other studies where suppress ion of  
methanogenic activity as a result of ammonia toxicity has been demonstrated in thermophilic systems  (Angelidaki and Ahring, 1993; Borja et al., 1996; Hansen et al., 
1998; Angelidaki et al., 2006; Nielsen and Ahring, 2007) . 
   To maximise the specific methane yield in thermophilic digestion of SS -DFW 
while avoiding  VFA accumulation and process instability , one approach is to reduce the 
TAN concentration in the digester by gas stripping . Ammonia stripping has been trialled 
using a range of approaches, including with and without solid/liquid separation and 
using air, nitrogen, steam or  biogas as the stripping agent ( Bonmati and Flotats, 2003; 
Ledda et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2013;  Nie et al., 2015;  Zeng et al., 2006;  Walker  et al. , 
2011).  Stripping with biogas has several advantages: the cost is low since biogas is produced on site in the anaerobic digestion process, and the risk of stripping carbonate 
from the digestate is reduced. Ammoni a stripping on the feedstock  prior to digestion can 
only be successfully applied to materials  such as manures  where a high percentage of 
the total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) is present as  TAN . In the case of SS -DFW this is not 
feasible,  as only about 7% of TKN in kerbside collected food waste is available as 
TAN, and further pre -hydrolysis leads to rapid acidification and lowering of pH  (Defra, 
2010) . An alternative is to allow hydrolysis to proceed in the digester itself, as is 
normal, and then remove ammonia in a side -stream stripping configuration. This 
approach has some merit , as previous studies have reported an increase in stripping 
efficiency at high er alkalinities  and ammonia concentrations (Campos et al., 2013) ; 
digestion also lower s the organic matter content , which reduces cation  binding and 
increases the proportion of ammonia that is strippable . Laureni et al. (2013) found that 
digestate storage  decreased the total solids , chemical oxygen demand , VFA 
concentration and alkalinity and improved the ammonia stripping efficiency.  Other 
factors may also a ffect the binding capacity of digestate for ammonia ; but the above 
findings clear ly indicate  that the ammonia stripping process is strongly dependent on 
digestate charact eristics . The se results  therefore throw some doubt on the kinetic values 
and time constants reported in the studies by De la Rubia et al. (2010) and Walker et al. (2011) , which used digestate that had been stored over long periods . The methodology 
employed in these studies was effective, however, and showed the value of using biogas as the stripping medium at flow rates  between 0.125 to 0.750 L
biogas min-1 L-1
digestate , and 
at different temperatures (35, 55 and  70 ⁰ C), with and without pH adjustment  using 
NaOH. A similar approach was thus adopted in the current study , but with the important 
difference that fresh digestate samples were taken directly from an operational food 
waste digester for each experimental run.  The main objective of the current work was 
thus to gather data on the ammonia stripping performance parameters of fresh SS- DFW  
digestate under a number of different stripping conditions , to provide data for the design 
of side -stream systems couple d to anaerobic digest ers as a means of redu cing TAN 
concentration s to non- inhibitory values for thermophilic digestion.  
 
2 Materials and methods  
 
2.1 Food waste digest ion 
Two 75- L working volume continuously -stirred tank reactors (CSTR) as 
previously described by Zhang et al. (2012) were operated as food waste digesters at a 
temperature of 36 ± 1°C (Figure 1 a). They were inoculated with digestate from a 
commercial AD plant treating SS -DFW (Biocycle digester , operated by 
BiogenGreenfinch, Ludlow, UK). The digesters were then fed daily on SS -DFW 
collected commercially by Veolia Environmental Services (UK) from ho useholds  in 
Eastleigh, Hampshire, UK. A  representative sample of around 300 kg was taken 
periodically as required, from material collected in the same collection round. The food waste was taken out of the biodegradable bags  in which it is collected , and any obvious 
non-food contamination was removed along with large bones and seeds. The sample 
was then ground (S52/010 Waste Disposer, IMC Limited, UK) to a homogeneous pulp, well mixed as a s ingle batch and frozen at - 18 °C in ~4 kg aliquots in snap- top plastic 
containers. When needed, the feedstock was thawed then stored at 4 °C and used within a short period. The characteristics of the inoculum and of the different batches of food waste used  in the experiment are shown in Table 1.   The digesters were operated for 462 days (4 hydraulic retention time ) at an OLR 
of 2 g VS kg-1 day-1 to provide  fresh digestate samples from a stable and well -operated 
digestion process with a known history, running under conditions typical of full -scale 
AD plant. The digesters were supplemented with trace element s according to the 
recommendation s of Banks et al. (2012)  and were monitored for pH, TAN, alkalinity, 
VFA, biogas production an d gas composition. Biogas production was measured 
continuously using tipping -bucket gas flow meters (Walker et al., 2009). At least once 
per fortnight the biogas was collected in a gas -impermeable bag for 0.5 -hour periods 
starting 5 hours after reactor fee ding. This sample was used to determine the biogas 
composition.  
 
2.2 Batch operated ammonia stripping column  The experimental procedure for batch ammonia stripping was based on Walker 
et al. (2011). The stripping column was a 56 cm high glass tube with a  10 cm internal 
diameter which tapered to an  inlet fitted with a sintered glass diffusor disc of 3 cm 
diameter. The column was enclosed in a water jacket with inlet and outlet hose connections : column temperature was maintained by the circulation of hot wa ter 
through the jacket using a thermo- circulator (Techne Circulator C -85A). The stripping 
gas used was a mixture of 65  % CH
4 and 35 % CO 2 (v/v) (BOC , UK) . The gas was 
maintained in a  gas-impermeable storage bag and a proportion of it was used to flush 
the system , in order to replace the air initially present in the column.  Stripping gas could 
then be drawn from the top of the stripping column by means of a peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow Sci -Q 323) , and circulated back to the bottom of the column in a gas 
circulation loop containing ammonia traps. The se were simply a set of conical flasks 
connected in series : the first was a condensate trap, the second contained  deionised 
water, the third  a 0.25 N H
2SO 4 acid trap, and finally a second deionised water trap. 
This series of traps gave complete removal of ammonia from the gas stream, allowing it 
to operate as a closed loop. The gas bag was also incorporated into the loop and acted as 
a gas reservoir mitig ating any subsequent volume changes in the system . The 
experimental set -up is shown in Figure 1b.  
 
 In operation the column was filled with 2 kg of the digestate under test , which 
was collected fresh from the wastage line of the 75 -L digesters  and sieved through a 1 
mm mesh . The system was flushed by pumping the gas mixture at a rate of 0. 380 L  min-
1 for 15 minutes and venting the gas from the top of the stri pping column. The gas loop 
was then closed to the ambient air and the peristaltic pump was set at the desired gas flow rate.   
  TAN concentrations  in each of the  traps w ere determined at the end of each 
experiment.  The results of the first 5 experimental trials  indicated that only two traps 
were needed (water and acid) and the number of traps was thus reduced to two in 
subsequent tests.  2.3 Experimental runs using the  ammonia stripping column  
Stripping experiments were carried out to assess the effect of pH, temperature 
and gas flow rate, in all cases follow ing the procedure described above.  Stripping 
column temperatures of 35, 55 and 70 ⁰ C were tested, at gas flow rates between 0.125-
0.250 L min
-1, and with pH unadjusted or adjusted to 10 using CaO, Ca(OH) 2 or NaOH. The effectiveness of the stripping process in terms of TAN removal rates and final 
percentage removal was compared to results from previous research (De la Rubia et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2011) .  
 
 Further experiments were carried out to assess whether thermal -alkaline 
treatment promoted the degradation of organic nitrogen -containing materials into the 
ammonia form . The batch ammonia stripping equipment was used in this case at 70 ⁰ C 
without continuous stripping and at pH 10 adjusted using CaO. While the digestate was being heated  two consecutive acid traps of 25 mL  and 50 mL  were used to capture any 
ammonia released as a result of the initial temperature increase.  During the remainder of 
the experiment d igestate TAN, TKN, pH and VFA concentration were monitored.  
 2.4 Analytical methods  
Total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), pH, alkalinity, TKN, TAN and VFA 
concentrations and biogas composition (CH
4 and CO 2) were determined  following the 
analysis protocols described in Serna -Maza et al. (2014).  
 
2.5 Calculation methods  
 2.5.1  Ammonia removal rate  
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the stripping technique and to allow 
comparison with the results of previous studies, the concept of the time constant was used (Walker et al., 2011). The experimental TAN concentration profile obtained for each st ripping condition was fitted to an exponential decay curve (1
st order kinetic) as 
shown in equation 1. 
 
C=Co∙e−t
τ          (1) 
 
where C is TAN concentration (mg N kg-1 wet weight basis); C 0 is the initial TAN 
concentration (mg N kg-1
ww), t is time (hours) and τ is the ammonia removal time 
constant (hours). The time constant τ thus represents the time required to reduce the TAN concentration by (1 - e
-1), or approximately 63% of the initial value, and allows 
quantitative comparison between experimental runs with different initial and final conditions . 
 2.5.2  Nitrogen mass balance in batch striping columns  
A nitrogen balance for the batch stripping tower was carried out based on 
equations 2 and 3.

and acid traps at the end of the experiment, respectively; and N samples  is the mass of 
nitrogen sampled from the experiment as digestate (g) . The N samp les component was not 
included in calculation of N mass balance s. 
  The unrecovered matter mass from the column was determined from equation 4. 
 
Unrecovered matter  =Massdig in−Massdig out−Masssample−Mass gaintraps−Solidrecovered  (4) 
 
where Mass sample  is the mass of digestate taken from the column in the experiment 
(~0.007 kg per sample); Mass gain traps is the mass increase measured at the end of the 
experiment in the condensate, water and acid ammonia traps (kg); and  Solid recovered  is 
the mass of soli d in stripping column at the end of the experiment (kg).  
 2.5.3 Ammonia stripping efficiency  
The efficiency with which the stripping gas is used was calculated based on the 
difference between the ammonia concentration in the biogas after stripping and the theoretical concentration at equilibrium, according to equation 5.

3 Results and discussion  
 
3.1  75-L food waste digesters  
The inoculum and feedstock characteristi cs are shown in Table 1a and b. 
Average values for performance and monitoring parameters during the steady state 
period are shown in Table 1c. T he digesters performed well throughout the operating 
period. Specific biogas production was stable with values of 0.83 ± 0.04 L g-1 VS added 
for digester 1 and 0.85 ± 0.04 L g-1 VS added for digester 2, and average methane 
concentration was in the range 52.3 -  57.9 %. The VS destruction under steady state 
conditions was 84 %.  
 
3.2 Comparison of alkaline compounds for pH control  
To select a means o f adjust ing and maintaining pH , an initial experiment was 
carried out compar ing CaO  (lime ) and Ca(OH) 2 (slaked lime ). Each was added to 100 g 
of fresh food waste digestate and the pH was monitored over time without any stripping. An initial temperature increase was observed for CaO addition at the applied dosage of 
20 g kg-1. This was not considered significant since t he temperature remained below the 
lowest stripping temperature (35 ⁰ C); and therefore no temperature control was applied 
during pH adjustment. Both compounds were able to achieve the required final pH after 23 hours and to maintain it over time. Since CaO is easier to handle, and since the same dose of both compounds was needed to reach a certain pH, CaO was selected in preference to Ca(OH)
2. Lim e is considered less inhibitory to AD than sodium or 
potassium hydroxide, but also less efficient as an alkaline agent (Zhang and Jahng, 2010; Kleybocker et al., 2012) . The initial test carried out with CaO and Ca(OH)
2 was 
therefore repeated for NaOH, using a fresh sample of digestate from the same digester under the same operating conditions. 33.8 ml of a 10 M NaOH solution ( equivalent to 
13.6 g  NaOH ) was needed per kg of sieved food waste digestate to increase the pH to 
10, compared to 20 g of CaO.  
 
 Based on the results of the initial tests, batch stripping tests were carried out 
with CaO (20 g kg
-1) and NaOH  (13.6 g kg-1). The results are shown in Figure 2 and in 
the overall summary in Table 2. At 70 ⁰ C the stripping performance with NaOH was 
slightl y better, especially between 40 -100 hours, but at 35 ⁰ C there was little difference 
between the two alkaline agents. Since the  performance of these two compounds is 
similar the final choice between them is likely to be based on operational and other factors. When CaO was used, long mixing times were needed to favour the hydration reaction in which  calcium hydroxide is generated. The CO
2 present in the biogas also 
reacts with Ca(OH) 2 to form insoluble carbonate salts that could introduce operational 
problems such as solids blockage in the stripping column. Both CaO and  Ca(OH) 2, 
however, are widely used to increase pH before stripping treatments because of their 
low cost and the potential for phosphorus removal (Cheung, 1995) . On the other hand, 
NaOH addition was an easy and quick method to increase pH, but foaming problems occurred during the stripping process making it necessary to add antifoaming agent. There are also concerns that AD inhibition by the Na
+ cation could occur , as was 
observed within a short period during air stripping of pig manure (Zhang and Jahng, 2010; Zhang et al., 2011) . Since this  study aimed to provide data for the design of side -
stream stripping systems, in which a proportion of the treated digest ate is returned to the 
digeste r, the issue of Na
+ accumulation is a major consideration, and for this reason the 
use of  CaO is preferred  even though the dosage needed is 1.5 times higher than with 
NaOH.  
 3.3 Batch  ammonia stripping experiments   
Figure  S1 in supplementary data show s the digestate pH profile s during the 
batch stripping runs . When alkali was not added to the stripping column there was an 
initial increase in pH of 0.3 -  0.5 units , probably caused by equilibration of carbonates 
and CO
2 volatilisation. Increasing the temperature also decreases  CO 2 solubility , and 
this may have be en associated with an initial generation of foam that decreased with 
time. As stripping progressed , in most cases the pH gradually decreased to 0.2 – 0.6 
units below  the original value , but this was dependent on temperature:  for example, at 
35 ⁰C without pH adjustment the pH remained constant during the 383- hour 
experimental run.   
  When alkali was added to increase the pH at the start of the experiment, the final  
pH value s decreased by 0.6 – 1.7 units in all experimental runs . This is likely to be due 
to the removal of FAN, w ith consequent changes in the ammonia -ammonium 
equilibrium produc ing more dissolved gas and releasing some protons . The decrease in 
pH was on ly slight, however, since the carbonate system is the major buffering element .  
 
 TAN removal profiles from all the batch stripping runs are shown in Figure 2. It 
can be seen that without alkali addition no ammonia reduction occurred in mesophilic temperatures (run 1) ; even in thermophilic conditions (run 2 and 3) the average 
reduction was only 1.7 % N per day. In these experiments the biogas flow rate was not 
regarded as being a limiting factor, as the flow rates  used w ere greater than the 0.032 m
3 
m-2
tank cross -section  min-1 that corresponds  to violent gas mixing in a reactor ( Perry and 
Green, 1999) . The free ammonia fraction of the digestate TAN at unadjusted pH (pH 7) 
is 1 % at 35 °C and 3 % at 55 °C. This small difference in ammonia concentration 
between the stripping gas and free ammonia in the digestate means the driving force is low and thus the ammonia removal rate is poor . It was therefore concluded that a simple 
in situ  stripping system operating in a digester at either 35 or 5 5 ⁰C without pH 
adjustment w ould not be effective in reducing digestate ammonia concentrations. This 
result indicates that method proposed by Walker et al. (2011), of in situ  stripping in a 
digester using a modified gas mixing system, would not be s uccessful .  
 
 The TAN concentration profile for the stripping experiment at 55 ⁰ C (run 4) 
showed an initial increase in ammonia with the maximum concentration found after 35 -  
43 hours of operation. This indicates that further hydrolysis was occurring leading to 
generation of ammonia nitrogen from N
org, and the rate of production was greater than 
that of TAN removal by stripping. It is therefore p ossible that thermophilic treatment at 
55 ⁰C could give a slight improve ment in  the overall biogas yield from food waste , as 
there is some increase in  degradation. T ampio et al. (2014) showed, however, that 
temperatures  of 160 oC led to a reduction in biogas yields probably due to denaturation  
of proteins .  The temperature limits where positive benefits may occur are not known. 
  Further evidence of degradation taking place in the stripping column can be see n 
in supplementary data Figure S2 . In general, total VFA concentration s increased 
progressively with time during the stripping process. For this to occur it is likely that some particulate organic matter is being hydrolysed into soluble organics and then fermented. Increases in VFA caused by thermal hydrolysis of fresh OFMSW at high 
temperatures (65 -  70 ⁰ C) and during digestion under thermophilic conditions have been 
previously reported (Rintala and Ahring, 1994; Hartmann and Ahring, 2005) . In the 
current work no clear pattern was found and VFA production is likely to be infl uenced 
by many factors, e.g. duration of the stripping experiment, temperature, and initial pH.  
  
With the exception of run 1 at 35 ⁰ C where no TAN removal occurred, there was 
a clear decrease in alkalinity over the stripping period when alkali was not added at the 
start (data not shown) . This is accounted for by carbonate destruction, which is 
promoted by FAN removal, increase in VFA concentration and precipitation of salts. 
 
 The above observations and results all indicate that further hydrolysis and 
acidification of the digestate could occur when it was taken from the main digester and vigorously sparged with biogas  in a separate reactor. To measure the associated changes 
in TAN accurately a mass balance approach was adopted.  
 
3.4 Nitrogen mass balance in batch stripping columns  
In the stripping process part of the N org in the digestate is broken down: the proportion 
varied between stripping conditions, with the lowest breakdown (7.3 - 9.4 %) found at 
35 ⁰C, unadjusted and modified pH (runs 1, 10 and 11), while the highest (34.9 %) was 
found at 55 ⁰ C, non- modified pH (run 2). Table s S1 and S2 in supplementary data show 
the digestate characteristics at the start and end of the batch stripping run s. 
  Nitrogen mass balances (equations 2 and 3) were calculated for each of the 17 
experimental runs (Table 2) and the results are shown in Figure 3.  In most of these the 
TKN concentration in the digestate at the start of the experiment was higher than the sum of the TKN in the digestate at the end of the run and the nitrogen f ound in the traps. 
The main source of error in this balance is due to unrecovered material, including unaccounted -for N in the mass of digestate which remains attached to the column 
(Table S2, supplementary data) and in samples removed for analysis.  
  On average the unrecovered digestate was estimated at 59 g. If this lost mass is 
added to the final mass of digestate the % N loss is reduced by 0.3 - 6.0 %. The amount 
of missing nitrogen could be further reduced if the volume sampled from the columns is added . Some of the lost mass could also be associated with crystallisation of nitrogen 
compounds inside the tubes in the stripping rig: this would further decrease the unaccounted -for nitrogen. A secondary source of error is the nitrogen loss during the 
air-flushing period. This  loss is considered to be small, however, as the maximum mass 
of nitrogen present in the gas in the first 15 min of stripping was only 48 and 40 mg N (run 14 and 16 res pectively).   
  Bonmati and Flotats (2003)  reported similar problems with unrecovered nitrogen 
(6 to 16 %) during air stripping of ammonia from pig slurry. Laureni et al. (2013) 
attributed N losses (3 to 55 %) and overestimations (5 to 15 %) to manure and digestate attached to the filling material in the stripping column. These studies, however, carried out a TAN balance rather than  a TKN balance: the latter is more accurate as it takes into 
account the breakdown of N
org.  
 3.5 Comparison of time constants  
 3.5.1 Previous studies  
Time constants found in the current research (Table 2) were from 1.6 to 5.7 
times higher than those determined under the same experimental conditions in a previous study conducted by Walker et al. (2011) . In that study two sources of food 
waste digestate, were used (digestate 1: TS = 5.50 %; TAN = 8000 mg N L
-1; pH 8.5-
9.3; digestate 2: TS = 3.14 %; TAN = 6000 mg N L-1; pH = 8.1- 8.2) and both were 
stored for periods of weeks or months prior to use ; whereas the current work used fresh 
food waste digestate (TS = 6.60 %; TAN = 4560 - 4925 mg N kg-1
ww; pH 7.9- 8.3) 
obtained from a stable well -run pair of digesters. As the methodology used was 
identical, and both sets of digestate  were from digestion of similar source segregated 
food waste s, the only major difference was that Walker’s  two digestates had been stored and the current set was fresh.  It therefore appears that it is more difficult to strip 
ammonia from fresh food waste digestate than from stored digest ates.  These results 
support the findings of Laureni et al. (2013) that storage may affect stripping 
performance, but as the digestates tested differ slightly in a number of characteristics, e.g. TAN and solids content, VFA concentrations and alkalinity it  is not yet clear which 
of these factors are most important in promoting higher ammonia removal.  It is 
believed, however, that the time constants derived in the current study (Table 2) are representative of those for fresh digestate in well -operated digest ers and are likely to be 
applicable to the design of full -scale ammonia stripping plant.  
 
3.5.2 Analysis of the effects of temperature, pH and biogas flow  
The effect on the time constant of changing the gas flow rate, stripping 
temperature and pH was analysed (Table 3). The results showed that in this flow range doubling of the gas flow rate does not induce a similar increase in ammonia removal. When the tem perature or the pH in the stripping column is  decreased, however, the time 
constant increases sharply . The purpose of increasing the digestate pH in the stripping 
process is to shift the ammonium -ammonia equilibrium to the gaseous ammonia form, 
increase the ammonia concentration gradient between the biogas and the digestate and favour the release of ammonia from the liquid phase. For example at 55 °C an increase in pH from 7 to 10 incr eases the free ammonia as a fraction of TAN from 3 % to 97 %. 
This is the main reason for the improved ammonia removal at higher pH.   
 
3.6 Ammonia stripping efficiency  
Using the concept of Henry’s law a relationship can be obtained between the 
FAN concent ration in the liquid phase and the ammonia concentration expressed as 
partial pressure in the gas phase at each point in the experiment (equations 11 and 12). 
The E  value (equation 5) for each experiment shows the efficiency of the experimental 
conditions based on H
stripping  and H equilibrium . 
 
 For all of the experimental runs, when P' NH3 was plotted against C' FAN to allow 
determination of H stripping (equation 7), a linear relationship passing through the origin 
was found (Table 4).  
 
 The ammonia concentration of the biogas generated by the 75 -L digesters in 
section 3.1 was analysed. The proportionality constant (H digester ) that relates the 
solubility of ammonia in water to its partial pressure in the gas was calculated following the principle of Henry’s law. The results showed good agreement with the stripping 
experiments performed at natural pH and 35 ⁰ C (Figure S 3a, supplementary data). In 
both cases equilibrium is not reached.  
 
 At unadjusted pH an increase in the gas flow rate does not increase the H
stripping  
value ( Figure S 3a, supplementary data ). When the pH was adjusted to 10, however, an 
increase in the gas flow rate leads to a decrease in the H stripping  value ( Figure S 3b, 
supplementary data ), indicating that the biogas is used in a less efficient manner.  Figure 
S2c presents a comparison of non- modified and adjusted pH: from this it can be 
concluded that an increa se in pH would lead to a rise in H stripping . The most efficient 
ammonia stripping condition tested is 70 ⁰ C and pH 10 (Figure 4).  
 3.7 Hydrolysis experiment  
To confirm the hypothesis of ammonia generation from N org a hydrolysis 
experiment was conducted where digestate was subjected to temperature/pH increase 
without stripping .  
 
 Heating to 70 ⁰ C without alkali addition (Figure 5) had a clear effect on the 
nitrogenous material: the TAN concentration increased and N org decreased, with the 
TKN concentration remaining constant during the experiment. There was a decrease in N
org of 15.3 -19.0 % and 25.1- 27.8 % after 22- 25 and 94- 98 hours, respectively. The pH 
showed an initial increase due to CO 2 desorption caused by the  rise in temperature, then 
decreased slowly (range 8.37 -  8.07) due to ammonium de -protonation caused by the 
TAN increase. A mass balance calculation showed the unaccounted -for total nitrogen to 
be less than 1.6 %. The VFA concentration increased rapidly f rom 140- 340 mg L-1 to 
6300- 6600 mg L-1, which correlated with a decrease in TS from 6.3 % to 5.6 % and in 
VS from 4.4 % to 3.7 %.  
 
 At 70 ⁰ C with alkali addition (Figure 5 ), the TAN profiles showed no increase. 
This may be due to volatilisation of a small amount of FAN when the digestate is 
maintained at high temperature, and to a lesser extent during the brief interval before sample analysis, leading to a lower TAN measure ment which in turn affects the 
calculation of N
org. At 70 ⁰ C with pH 8.2 and 9.6, 58.8 % and 97.3 % respectively of 
the total TAN is in the form of free ammonia. At 4 ⁰ C during storage in a refrigerator, 
1.8 % and 31.5 % of the TAN is present as FAN at pH 8.2 and 9. The effect of volatilisation can be seen in the initial TKN values: in all cases the TKN before the pH increase was greater than after the pH increase for the same digestate sample. Bonmati 
and Flotats (2003) also reported that pH adjustment produced a decrease in TKN and 
TAN concentration for digested and fresh pig slurry, and attributed this to volatilisation promoted by high temperatures. The VFA concentration in the hydrolysis experiment with alkali addition  showed only a small change , from 1 80-260 mg L
-1 to 560 mg L-1. 
The TS content at the end of the experiment was higher than that in the original sieved digestate due to the addition of lime (initial TS 6.3 % , final TS 9.1 %); the VS 
destruction rate was lower than in the hydrolysis experiment without pH adjustment (initial VS 4.4 % , final VS 4.1 %). The unaccounted- for nitrogen in the mass balance 
was 2.4- 3.2 %, greater than in the experiments without pH adjus tment. This is likely to 
be due to the fact that the higher pH promotes the escape of FAN into the gas phase, leading to higher losses and inaccuracy.  
  In all the experiments conducted the total amount of nitrogen found in the traps 
was lower than 4 mg, s howing that this was not a route by which the element left the 
system.   
  The results of the hydrolysis experiments suggest that the increase in TAN 
concentration and the subsequent 'lag' in removal at 55 ⁰ C without pH modification is in 
fact due to further production of TAN in the stripping columns, by thermally -promoted 
hydrolysis of organic nitrogen -containing materials. The ammonia released then 
contributes to the TAN concentration in the column.   4 Conclusions  
Time constants obtained for ammonia removal from fresh food waste digestates 
were much higher than those reported in previous studies using digestates stored for 
long periods.  The results clearly showed that in situ  ammonia removal is not fea sible 
under mesophilic or thermophilic conditions.  Ammonia stripping was most effective at 
70 ⁰C and pH 10 and under these conditions there was also evidence of further 
hydrolysis of N org leading to an overall increase in ammonia removal. This effect coul d 
be quantified by a mass balance approach.  The results indicate the feasibility of side -
stream stripping and provide kinetic constants for process design.
