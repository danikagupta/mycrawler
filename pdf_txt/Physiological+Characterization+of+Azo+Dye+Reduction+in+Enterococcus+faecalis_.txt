INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 Living organisms have the ability to adapt to their surroundings. This important 
strategy adopted by them is the basis for survival and propagation in an often highly 
competitive environment in which limited nutrient resources are available. Sel ective 
pressure from the environment forces only the fittest organisms to thrive, as thi s is the 
basis for Darwin’s theory of evolution. To this end, the presence of certain genes in  an 
organism whose products are used to metabolize unique nutrients may be explained by 
their environment. Prokaryotes living in complex communities are able to obtain unique 
genes from each other through lateral gene transfer. This process leads to tr emendous 
genetic diversity and hence prokaryotes are known to possess an enormous metabolic 
capacity.  
There is interest in knowing how organisms have evolved to metabolize 
xenobiotics, compounds that are not naturally encountered by the organism. Evolutionary 
adaptability to the environment takes millions of years; however, bacteria ar e known to 
adapt to these compounds after only a few years. Hence, the ability of bacter ia to degrade 
and utilize xenobiotic compounds is of particular interest because it will provide  better 
insight into the processes of molecular evolution and environmental adaptability.   2 CHAPTER II 
 
REVIEW OF LITERATURE 
 
General Introduction 
 
  The majority of life forms on earth are microscopic. Although they  are invisible 
to the naked eye, they have a tremendous impact in nature. It is hard  to imagine places 
that are not inhabited by microbes. The reason for their successful  colonization in various 
habitats is due to their diversity and adaptability.  The vast maj ority of microorganisms 
fall into the Bacteria and Archaea Domain of life or the Monera  kingdom. These 
prokaryotic cells are the major contributors of the planet’s tota l biomass and are 
estimated to be about 5 x 10 30  cells (Madigan M.T., 2003). Most of these microorganisms 
can not be cultured and maintained in an artificial laboratory environm ent. Hence, before 
the advancements of ribotyping and genetic analysis, our knowledge of  the diversity of 
microbes in a given habitat was limited.    
Archaea are considered to be the most ancient life forms and live in extreme 
environments. Bacteria also thrive in various conditions depending on their physiology 
and nutritional requirements. These organisms live in complex communiti es, particularly 
biofilms. Microbes interact with the environment and consume the surroundi ng nutrients. 
Some of the metabolic waste products produced by one species of bac teria are used as  3 nutrient sources for other species. Bacteria can have various ele ctron sources which 
include organic compounds (chemoorganotrophs) like glucose as well as si mple 
inorganic compounds (chemolithotrophs) like molecular hydrogen. Similarly, their 
terminal electron acceptors may include oxygen (aerobic respirati on), inorganic 
compounds other than oxygen (anaerobic respiration) and endogenous organic 
compounds (fermentation). Within the Bacteria Domain, cyanobacteria under go 
photosynthesis which involves capturing energy from sunlight and converting it to 
chemical energy (ATP).  
Due to their myriad metabolic systems and pathways, bacteria play an important 
role in their respective ecological niches. Environmentally, they are major contributors to 
the generation and maintenance of biogeochemical cycles. In a process  called 
bioremediation, the unique metabolic capacity of certain microbes c an be used to clean 
up environmental pollution that is otherwise recalcitrant and hazardous to humans and the 
environment. The process of fermentation by microbes has been exploited for many years 
in the food and beverage industries. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria have a huge economic 
impact on legume crops in agriculture. Finally, microbes play an i mportant role in the  
treatment of waste water to remove dissolved organic compounds.  
Over the past few decades, bacteria and yeast have been used in biotechnology 
and genetic engineering to produce various products of commercial inter est and their 
genetic manipulation has revolutionized fundamental research at the molecular le vel.  
 
 
  4 Role of Microbes in Disease 
The causative agent of many plant and animal diseases are micr obes and the 
diagnosis, prevention and treatment of these diseases can have a m ajor impact on human 
and animal health as well as agricultural industries. Although mos t of the application of 
biotechnology is for beneficial purposes, there is always the danger of bioterrori sm.  
 The importance of microorganisms in human health and disease can not be over 
stated. Besides understanding their role in pathogenesis, it is a lso equally important to 
understand the non-pathogenic association of bacteria with humans. 
 
Human Microbiota 
 Although pre-natal exposure to bacteria does not occur, infants first  encounter 
bacteria in the birth canal of the mother. Eventually, all parts of  the body are directly 
exposed to the environment i.e., skin and mucous membranes of the conjunctiva i n the 
eyes, ears, upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal (GI) trac t and urogenital tract (females) 
become colonized by bacteria. These bacteria outnumber microbial e ukaryotes and 
archaea and their colonization is a dynamic process which vari es with age, sex, genetics, 
diet and tissue (Todar, 2007) .   
The tissue tropism of bacteria is dependant upon the milieu offered b y the host. 
The temperature, pH and available nutrients vary within different re gions of the human 
body and certain species of bacteria acquire a selective advantage  over others based on 
their specific nutritional and metabolic requirements. For example, Staphylococcus 
epidermidis is predominantly present on the surface of the skin where  the pH is  between 
4 and 6 (Madigan M.T., 2003), while Enterococcus faecalis and  Escherichia coli  are  5 present in the colon where the pH is closer to neutral. Besides the host environment, the 
colonization of bacteria is also dependent on the attachment of a bac terial ligand to a  
host tissue receptor, such as the attachment of Streptococcus pyogenes to the amino 
terminus of fibronectin in the pharyngeal epithelium via its surface  protein F (Todar, 
2007) . Most of the microbes are benign, as only a few are opportunistic pat hogens which 
can cause infection under certain conditions that include a weakened immune system. 
There are many benefits associated with the microbiota as the y prevent the colonization 
of pathogens by either sequestering nutrients from them or by pr oducing antimicrobials, 
i.e., bacteriocins that inhibit growth or kill the cells. Other bene fits include the 
stimulation of the immune system and their contribution to the developme nt of certain 
organs like the caecum and Peyer’s patches of the human intestine (Todar, 2007) .  
 
Normal Flora of the GI tract  
 The largest numbers of bacteria that inhabit the human body resi de in the GI tract. 
The numbers in the adult GI tract are estimated to be 10 14  cells, which is an order of 
magnitude greater than all the cells in the human body (Savage,  1977). The initial 
estimated number of species in the GI tract was about 400-500 (Simon, 1984). The 
colonization of bacteria within the GI tract depends upon several fact ors. These include, 
but are not limited to, the process of birth (i.e. whether natural or  caesarean section) and 
mode of nutrition, eg. breast-fed or bottle-fed (Long and Swenson, 1977).  Throug hout 
the life of the individual, the number and predominant species of bacteri a can vary 
depending upon diet, age and health (Moore and Moore, 1995).    6   A recent metagenomic approach by scientists at The Institute of  Genomic 
Research (TIGR) has estimated more than one thousand species of microbes in the gut 
(Gill et al., 2006). Thus, the collective number of microbial genes is more than one 
hundred times the number of genes in the human genome and hence exhibit t remendous 
species and sub-species diversity. However, the superkingdom diversit y is low, showing 
only 8 of the 55 bacterial divisions (Backhed et al., 2005). Most of the bacteria are 
present in the colon, whose bacterial cell density is about as high as those found under 
optimal growth conditions in laboratory nutrient medium (Levison, 1990); however , their 
generation time is slower in situ  than in vitro  (Mitsuoka, 1978). The conditions in the 
upper GI tract are not conducive for stable colonization of bacteria because the gastric, 
biliary and pancreatic secretions kill most of them (Guarner a nd Malagelada, 2003). The 
colon may be similar to a chemoststat because digested food mat erial enters through the 
caecum at one end and faeces are excreated at the other e nd. The ratio of anaerobes to 
aerobes is 100-1000 to 1 (Sears, 2005). Within this complex environment there  is a high 
degree of interaction between the host and microbes. This communicatio n is enhanced 
because the bacteria are anatomically separated from the inte rnal blood vessels and 
lymphatic system by a single layer of epithelial cells (O'Hara a nd Shanahan, 2006). Using 
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron  to colonize gnotobiotic mice (Hooper et al., 2001), the 
authors showed that this resulting colonization altered the express ion of several host 
genes associated with many metabolic and developmental functions. I n terms of 
microbial impact, the metabolic activity of the microorganisms w ithin the GI tract is so 
high that it is considered an organ within the GI itself (Bocci, 1992).    7  There are several complex metabolic functions associated with i ntestinal bacteria. 
The components of the diet that could not be digested in the upper GI tr act are fermented 
in the colon, where most of the bacteria with the highest metabolic diversity are present 
(Roberfroid et al., 1995). This process thus maximizes the acquisition  of energy available 
from the diet as well as provides the required nutrients to sustain  the microbial 
population. Humans lack many of the enzymes that are needed to digest plant 
carbohydrates like, xylan and pectin (Gill et al., 2006), although com plex carbohydrates, 
oligosaccharides and proteins are fermented to generate short-c hain fatty acids. These are 
not only good sources of energy but also play a vital role in the matur ation and 
differentiation of epithelial cells (Guarner and Malagelada , 2003). There are other 
compounds metabolized by the gut flora including, nitrogen, glucuronides, ch olesterol, 
antibiotic, intestinal mucin, steroidal and non-steroidal compounds and bile  acids. 
Associated with metabolism are enzyme reactions involving the hy drolysis of sulphate 
esters and amide compounds as well as aromatization, dehydroxylat ion and 
decarboxylation (Drasar, 1974). Finally, vitamin synthesis, especial ly Vitamin K and the 
absorbance of important ions is an important contribution to the host by t he intestinal 
flora.  
 
Enterococcus faecalis  
 These organisms are Gram-positive cocci, non-spore forming and fac ultative 
anaerobes. They are classified as Firmicutes due to their low  G+C content and are one of 
the major inhabitants of the GI tract of mammals. This opportunistic  pathogen is 
associated with many diseases including, endocarditis and nosocomial infections. The  8 recent emergence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis  has provided the impetus for 
extensive research on this microorganism.     
 
Xenobiotic Metabolism   
 Xenobiotics are chemical compounds that are foreign to the host. Mos t of these 
compounds are widely used in the food and drug industry. Since the microflora  have 
diverse and unique metabolic capabilities, they play an important role in the metabolism 
of these compounds. Xenobiotics are sometimes toxic and mutagenic and hence  their 
chemical modification by enzymatic processes of the liver and int estinal flora is 
necessary to reduce or eliminate their deleterious effect. T he metabolic activities of the 
gut microflora are associated with reductive and hydrolytic proces ses (Drasar, 1974). 
There are two reaction Phases (I & II) which are involved direc tly towards the 
detoxification/modification of xenobiotics. 
 
Phase I  Reactions 
 Cytochrome P450 is a heme-protein that plays a very important rol e in this phase. 
This family of mixed-function mono-oxygenases is present in ma ny tissues, but they are 
most diverse in the liver microsomes. The oxidative process utilize s two protons and two 
electrons from NADPH (Roland et al., 1993) . A second important enzyme is the flavin-
monooxygenase or a mixed-function amine oxidase. Both these enzymes modify the 
xenobiotic by the addition of a hydroxyl moiety (Gandolfi, 1986).  The ma jor chemical 
reactions in this phase include hydrolysis, esterification and amida tion to expose 
preexisting functional groups. Once exposed, these functional groups are cl eaved to  9 produce other functional groups for further Phase II biotransformation. Other reactions in 
this Phase are oxidation and reduction processes. The chemical modifi cation of the 
xenobiotics makes them more hydrophilic to enhance their elimination ( Roland et al., 
1993).  
 
Phase II Reactions 
 The xenobiotics that are modified in Phase I undergo further biotransf ormation by 
a different set of enzymes to make them more hydrophilic. The mai n family of enzymes 
involved in these processes are glutathione-S-transferase and UDP-
glucuronosyltransferases. The biotransformation process involves the c onjugation of 
glutathione and glucuronic acid to the Phase I products (Roland et al. , 1993). Other 
enzymes involved in Phase II reactions include acetyltransferases  and sulfotransferases 
(Airoldi et al., 2004). These biosynthetic pathways require the act ivation of cofactors or a 
substrate and utilize ATP for energy (Gandolfi, 1986). Additionally,  transferases include 
epoxide hydrolases. The hydrophilic metabolites are excreted throug h bile and eliminated 
in urine. Since the biliary contents are excreted into the intes tines via the enterohepatic 
pathway (cycling), the metabolites can be further modified by the intestinal ba cteria.  
 
Role of Intestinal Flora in Xenobiotic Metabolism and Carcinogenesis 
 The intestinal microflora have a very high metabolic capacity. They can modify 
xenobiotics directly or they could biotransform metabolites genera ted from microsomal 
cytochrome P450. Several enzymes are associated with the xenobioti c-metabolizing 
potential of intestinal flora.  10   Demethylases are involved in the demethylation of methylmecu ry which is 
associated with its detoxification since the demethylated product  can not be absorbed by 
the intestine and is easily excreated (Rowland et al., 1983). An im portant class of 
enzymes produced by intestinal microflora is the β-glycosidases which includes, β-
glucosidase, β-galactosidase and β-glucoronidase. These enzymes hydrolyze the 
glycosidic bond that connects a sugar molecule to a non-sugar molec ule. These enzymes 
can generate toxic or carcinogenic compounds , for example, the deconjugating enzyme β-
glucoronidase can activate azoxymethane, a dimethylhydrazine car cinogenic derivative to 
induce intestinal cancer (Roland et al., 1993).  
  The toxicity of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA) is attributed to the form ation 
of DNA binding adducts such as  N-hydroxyl derivatives which are formed in the liver by 
the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes (CYP), especially CYP1A2 (Airoldi et al., 
2004). Intestinal bacteria can also oxidize HAAs to form N-hydroxyl derivatives. Some  
of the HAA can bind directly to the cell wall of the intestinal bacteria as wel l. There are 
two paths that the N-hydroxyl derivatives can undergo in the intestine. First, they may be 
transported to the liver from the intestine via the hepatic portal system to form  
glucuronide conjugates by UDP glucuronosyl transferases. The N-glucuronides are t hen 
transported back to the intestine where the enzyme, β-glucuronidase hydrolyses them to 
N-hydroxyl arylamines again (Kadlubar, 1985; Knasmuller et al., 2001). The second 
pathway involves the action of Phase II enzymes, acetyltransferases and sulfotr ansferases 
to convert the N-hydroxyl arylamines to O-esters such as N-acetoxy aryl amines and N-
sulfonyloxy arylamines (Airoldi et al., 2004). These O-esterified derivative s are much 
more electrophilic than the N-hydroxyl derivatives and are considered ultimate  
carcinogens (Kadlubar et al., 1977; Kadlubar, 1985; Airoldi et al., 2004).  The increased  11  electrophilic properties of these O-esters is due to the formation of a sta ble nitrenium 
intermediate, formed by heterolytic cleavage of the N-O bond which readily binds to 
DNA and subsequently damages it (Kadlubar, 1985; Borosky, 2007).  
        
DD DDyes yes yes yes  
Humans have been using natural dyes like inorganic pigments and plant aromatic  
compounds for centuries (Zee, 2002). However, in 1856, W.H Perkin, an English chemist 
was the first to produce and patent the synthetic dye mauveine which subsequently le d to 
research and development of other synthetic dyes (Welham, 2000). Dyes are aromati c 
compounds that absorb light in the visible electromagnetic spectrum (350-700 nm). The 
color of dyes is dependent on the chromophore and auxochrome, the former being  
chemical bonds like -N=N-, -C=C- and –C=N- where delocalization of electrons  in the 
conjugated double bond system occurs and the latter being molecules like ammonia, 
carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups which donate or accept electrons (Zee, 2002).  
Synthetic dyes are classified on the basis of their chromophore. The dyes can be br oadly 
classified into cationic (basic dyes), anionic (direct, reactive, aci d dyes) and uncharged 
(disperse dyes).  
 
Azo Dyes  
 Azo dyes are characterized by a specific –N=N- chromophore group or azo bond. 
Depending upon the number of azo bonds present, these dyes are classified into 
monoazo, diazo and polyazo groups. They are one of the most important dyes used in the 
textile, pharmaceutical and food industries (Chung et al., 1992; Chen, 2006). 
Interestingly, the only known natural compound that contains an azo group is 4,4’-  12  dihydroxyazobenzene (Gill, 1984). Some azo dyes presently used contain potentially  
carcinogenic compounds (Platzek et al., 1999). These dyes are cleaved to form toxic  
aromatic amines by enzymes in the liver and intestinal flora (Nakayama  et al., 1983; 
Chung et al., 1992; Chen, 2006). The susceptibility for azo bond cleavage depends upon 
the surrounding auxochrome groups. Electron withdrawing groups in the ortho  position 
relative to the azo bond decrease the electron density around the azo bond, thus making it 
more amenable to reduction. This may explain why extracts from Sphingomonas  sp. 
strain BN6 reduced Acid Black 24 with much lower activity than Amaranth (Fig. 1) 
(Russ et al., 2000).

These dyes, especially those that are lipophilic in nature, can be oxi dized by cytochrome 
P450 at the carbon or nitrogen atoms of the molecule keeping the azo bond int act 
(Hunger, 1994). Besides oxidation by microsomal enzymes, some azo dyes can also be 
oxidized by an extracellular peroxidase from Streptomyces chromofuscus A11 (Pasti-
Grigsby et al., 1996). The S5 strain, which is a mutant of the S1 st rain of 
Hydrogenophaga intermedia is able to grow on 4-carboxy-4 2-sulfoazobenzene, a 
sulfonated azo compound, as the sole carbon and energy source (Blumel et a l., 1998). 
Azo dye reduction is an important first step in their generation of c arcinogenic amines 
which is catalyzed primarily by intestinal flora (Brown, 1993) and al so by enzymes in the 
mammalian liver. Azo reduction is a Phase I process that can occ ur in the liver 
microsome by cytochrome P450 as well as intestinal bacteria.  
 
Azo Dye Reduction by Intestinal Bacteria Azo Dye Reduction by Intestinal Bacteria Azo Dye Reduction by Intestinal Bacteria Azo Dye Reduction by Intestinal Bacteria   
 The azo bridge (N=N) can be reduced by azoreductases to produce colorless 
aromatic amines (Chung et al., 1992). One of the first studies on the metabolism of az o 
dyes by bacteria showed that Bacillus pyocyaneus  and Proteus species reduced 90 of 102 
azo dyes tested (Dieckhues, 1960). Azo dye reduction may occur within the cell 
(endogenously) or external to the cell (exogenously). The redox potential of azo dye s is 
much lower than oxygen and hence in the presence of oxygen (aerobic environment) 
these dyes are not reduced. It has been shown that an anaerobic environment with a re dox 
potential between -100 and -300 mV promotes optimal azo dye reduction in the intestine 
(Schroder and Johansson, 1973). Other studies have shown that electron carriers in the 
external environment facilitate azo reduction (Brown, 1981; Semde´ R, 1998). It has be en  15  suggested that some azo dyes are reduced by a non-enzymatic process ex tracellularly due 
to the presence of electron shuttles (Dubin and Wright, 1975). Studies on the reduction of 
the azo dye, Red 2G by cell extracts of E. faecalis  have shown that FMN and reduced 
pyridine nucleotides were essential (Gingell and Walker, 1971). Other studie s have 
shown that the reduction of azo dyes by anaerobic cell suspensions showed zero-orde r 
kinetics where the reduction rate was independent of azo dye concentration but  dependent 
on the bacterial cell suspension only (Dubin and Wright, 1975). Studies by Rafii et al . 
(Rafii et al., 1990) showed that some  anaerobic intestinal bacteria had the abili ty to 
reduce Direct Blue 15. All strains reduced the dyes under anaerobic conditions, but some  
required flavin compounds for reduction. According to the authors, the azoreductases 
from all the strains were produced constitutively and the dye reduction occurred 
extracellularly. Recently, it was shown that Shewanella decolorationis  could grow with 
an azo compound as the sole electron acceptor and that quinones, dehydrogenases and 
cytochromes from the electron transport chain play an important role in the path way 
involved in azo reduction under anaerobic conditions (Hong et al., 2007).   
 
Azoreductase 
 One of the first true azoreductase enzymes to be purified and characteriz ed was 
from Pseudomonas  KF46 (Zimmermann et al., 1982). This enzyme was a monomer 
capable of reducing Orange II and carboxy-Orange II and could utilize NA DH as well as 
NADPH as electron donors. Its molecular weight was 30 kDa. Subsequently, an Ora nge I 
azoreductase was isolated from Pseudomonas  K24 (Zimmermann et al., 1984). Although 
it shared common features with the Orange II azoreductase from strain KF4 6 in terms of  16  its monomeric structure, substrate and co-substrate specificities, the Or ange I 
azoreductase was 21 kDa and did not have any antigenic cross reactivity with the O range 
II azoreductase. Neither of these azoreductases required externally a dded flavins for 
activity. No N-terminal sequencing was performed on these azoreductases, s o no direct 
comparison of the proteins at the primary structure level was available.  La ter, in other 
independent studies, the azoreductase from Xenophilus azovorans  KF46F (earlier called 
Pseudomonas  KF46) (Blumel et al., 2002) and Pigmentiphaga kullae  K24 (earlier called 
Pseudomonas  K24) (Blumel and Stolz, 2003) were purified and their N-terminal residues 
was sequenced. These two azoreductases did not share any homology which would 
explain the lack of antigenic cross reactivity, however, both the sequences posses sed a 
NAD(P)H binding motif.  
The first flavin-dependent azoreductases from an intestinal bacterium we re 
isolated from Shigella dysenteriae  type 1 and these enzymes could utilize NADH as well 
as NADPH for activity. Azoreductase I was a dimer and had a molecular w eight of 28 
kDa, while azoreductase II was a monomer and had a molecular weight of 11 kDa. 
Azoreductase II was not able to reduce Amaranth, but the dye was reduced by 
azoreductase I (Ghosh et al., 1992), which shows different substrate specificit ies. 
Similarly, two azoreductases from E. coli  K12 were purified, one being a monomer (12 
kDa) and the other a dimer (28 kDa) (Ghosh et al., 1993). Although their substrate 
specificities were slightly different, both azoreductases could utilize NA D(P)H as 
electron donors. However, since there was no genetic information available for the se 
azoreductases, they could not be compared.    17   The azoreductase from Bacillus  sp. OY1-2 was the first to be heterologously 
expressed and purified from E. coli  (Suzuki et al., 2001). The purified recombinant 
protein was shown to reduce several azo dyes using NADPH as the electron donor, 
however no flavins were required for the reaction. A  ping-pong mechanism was used for 
dye reduction by the azoreductase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides  AS1.1737 which 
shares 97% identity with Bacillus  sp. OY1-2 (Bin et al., 2004).   
The first human intestinal azoreductase in which the molecular and functional 
aspect of the enzyme was characterized came from E. coli .  The acpD  gene product 
(AcpD) which was thought to be an acyl carrier protein (ACP) phosphodiesterase was  
shown to possess azoreductase but no phosphodiesterase activity in E. coli  JM109 
(Nakanishi et al., 2001). The azoreductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa  which was also 
identified as the product of the acpD  gene, like the E. coli  AzoR, did not possess 
phosphodiesterase activity (Wang et al., 2007). The AcpD enzyme from E. coli and P. 
aeruginosa  were later renamed AzoR and paAzoR1 respectively. AzoR did not have an 
FMN moiety bound to it and externally added FMN was essential for activity. Thi s 
enzyme could utilize only NADH as an electron donor and not NADPH. The mechanism 
involved a ping pong Bi-Bi process where 2 mol of NADH reduced 1 mol of Methyl Red 
via FMN. On comparison of AzoR with other azoreductases whose sequence was 
determined, there was only moderate homology with the N-terminal domain of 
NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) from rat. The hydrogen bonding residues in 
the N-terminal region of NQO1 which contains the FMN and nicotinamide ribose of 
NADP + binding sites are well conserved in AzoR.  18   Subsequently, the acpD (azoR ) gene sequence from E. coli  was used as a 
query to BLAST search the genome of E. faecalis . This search led to the identification of 
a gene that was annotated as a putative ACP which shared only 34% sequence identity 
with AzoR (Chen et al., 2004). The enzyme (AzoA) was expressed and purified from E. 
coli. It is a dimer of  43 kDa with an FMN molecule bound to each monomer tightly, but 
non-covalently. The enzyme could utilize NADH only as an electron donor to reduce 
Methyl Red. Using a similar approach to identify an azoreductase, the azoreduc tase from 
Staphylococcus aureus  was identified using the gene sequence of the Bacillus  sp. OY1-2 
azoreductase as a query against the S. aureus  database (Chen et al., 2005). This enzyme, 
designated Azo1, was a flavoprotein as well; however it was a tetramer in i ts native state 
and could only utilize NADPH for activity. This enzyme is constitutively expre ssed in S. 
aureus  and its gene shows 32% identity with the azoreductase gene from Bacillus  sp. 
OY1-2.  
 
Crystal structures of Azoreductase  
 The first azoreductase from a human intestinal bacterium to be crystallize d was 
also the  AzoR from E. coli (PDB code: 1V4B) (Ito et al., 2006). The FMN-enzyme 
complex was shown to be a homodimeric protein with both monomers contributing to the 
catalytic site. Each monomer contained a flavodoxin-like fold with FMN at t he interface 
of the dimers. The monomers contain a typical Rossmann NAD(P)  -binding fold with five 
parallel β-sheets in the center flanked by six α-helices. The NADH binding site in AzoR 
is unique as it does not contain the conserved NADH binding motif (G XGXX G).  19  Conformational changes around the active site have been attributed to the binding of 
several substrates.  
Following the crystallization of AzoR, the crystal structure of AzoA from E. 
faecalis was also determined complexed with FMN (PDB code: 2HPV) (Liu et al., 2007).  
The crystal structure was very similar to AzoR and superimposition of the two st ructures 
revealed a difference around loop L 12 of AzoR which is close to the catalytic si te and 
may play a role in the binding of NAD(P)H. The conserved phenylalanine, which is 
present in the active site of AzoR and rat quinone reductase is absent in the active si te of 
AzoA and Leucine is present instead. However, like AzoR, Loop 9 and Loop 13 in AzoA 
are associated with the regulation of the active site.   
The azoreductase from P. aeruginosa paAzoR1  (PDB code: 2v9c) was 
crystallized with FMN and Methyl Red (Wang et al., 2007). The Methyl Red moie ty is 
positioned on the Si face of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN and π-stacking interactions 
also contribute to its stability in the hydrophobic pocket. Although paAzoR1 is a tetram er 
(dimer of dimers), its overall structure is very similar to AzoR and AzoA which a re 
dimers i.e., they all contain a flavodoxin-like fold. The active site of these enzyme s is 
formed with both monomers and is highly conserved (Liu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007) 
with the FMN molecule oriented in the same position i.e., the ribityl tail is embedde d in 
the protein and the Si  face of the isoalloxazine ring exposed to the substrate binding site. 
Figure 2 compares the crystal structures of AzoA, AzoR and paAzoR monomers w ith the 
FMN moiety bound and shows the high architectural similarity between them.

  21   The crystal structure of the reduced form of AzoR has also been crystalliz ed (Ito 
et al., 2008). In the reduced state, there is a twisted-butterfly bend of the FMN 
isoalloxazine ring with the solvent molecules being rearranged. The hydrophobic  region -    
around the isoalloxazine ring in the binding pocket is important for substrate binding. 
Also, by replacing Arginine 59 with Alanine, the substrate specificity could be e xpanded 
to include p-Methyl Red. This is because of the absence of an electrostatic  interaction 
between Arg-59 and the carboxy group around Methyl Red which is formed in the wild-
type enzyme.   
 
Conclusion  
  Azo dyes are anthropogenic compounds that are widely used in several industries 
including the food and drug industries. Research in azo dyes is of importance not only 
because of their contribution to the economies of the world but these dyes are also 
recalcitrant to degradation and are environmental pollutants. From the human healt h 
perspective, some of these dyes can be metabolized to carcinogenic compounds by 
azoreductases from intestinal microbiota and cytochrome P450. 
  Most of the earlier studies have focused on the metabolism of these dyes by li ver 
microsomal enzymes. Although, it is now known that a majority of the hydrophilic azo 
dyes are metabolized by intestinal flora. Important information gained from  azoreductase 
studies includes the varied enzyme structure and function. For example, it is diffic ult to 
identify the enzymes based on a common motif. In addition, some classification sche mes 
have been created based on cofactor requirements.  Information on the crystal st ructures 
of azoreductases has given important clues towards substrate binding and specific ity.  22   However, there is still a lack of information available on the physiological e ffects 
of these dyes on intestinal flora, the cellular environment in which the azoreducta se gene 
is expressed, and the evolutionary nature of the enzyme. A robust classificati on of these 
enzymes will be important in determining the evolution of these enzymes and may al lude 
to a physiological function for these enzymes which have not been identified to date.    
    23  CHAPTER III 
PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS  
DURING AZOREDUCTASE ACTIVITY 
 
Abstract 
 Azo dyes are widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, paper and textile 
industries. Some azo dyes are known to produce carcinogenic compounds upon reductive 
cleavage of the azo bond (N=N) by intestinal flora. There is not much information 
available on the effect of these dyes on the physiology of the gut microflora or  the 
kinetics of reduction in different environments. The azoreductase activity of E.  faecalis, 
an important opportunistic intestinal pathogen, was tested using the azo dyes Methyl R ed, 
Direct Blue 15 and Tartrazine under the following conditions: a complex supplemented 
Brain Heart Infusion (BHIS) medium under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, a simple  
phosphate-buffered saline glucose (PBSG) medium under anaerobic conditions and cell  
extracts using NADH and NADPH as electron donors under aerobic conditions. The 
kinetics of reduction in all these conditions was determined. The effect of high and low 
concentrations of each dye on the growth of E. faecalis  was also tested. The results show 
that the sulfonated azo dye Tartrazine was completely reduced extracellul arly in BHIS 
under aerobic and anaerobic conditions while      24  the other sulfonated azo dye, Direct Blue 15 was completely reduced only under 
anaerobic conditions. The non-polar azo dye, Methyl Red was also completely reduced 
with the highest rate of reduction in both conditions. The generation time of E. faecalis  in 
the presence of a high concentration of Tartrazine was significantly low er than the 
control while the generation time was unaffected in the presence of low and high 
concentrations of Methyl Red, Direct Blue 15 and 20 µM Tartrazine. Our results suggest 
that the metabolism of different azo dyes by E. faecalis depends on the physio-chemical 
properties of the azo dyes and the conditions of the surrounding environment in the 
presence of actively dividing cells.

  25  Introduction 
 Human beings are constantly exposed to various xenobiotics from the 
environment. The main route of entry for these xenobiotics is the gastrointestinal ( GI) 
tract (Hanninen et al., 1987). The metabolic complexity of gut microflora has pl ayed an 
important role in drug (Mikov, 1994) and azo dye (Chung et al., 1992; Chen, 2006) 
metabolism.  
            Azo dyes are widely used in the paper, textile, food, cosmetic and pharmaceutica l 
industries and the reduction of the azo bond (N=N) is observed by decolorization of the 
dye (Rafii et al., 1990). The distal region of the GI tract is mainly anaerobic a nd under 
these conditions, most of the azo compounds are biologically reduced (Stolz, 2001).  Azo 
dye metabolism is of interest from the human health perspective because sever al 
intestinal microorganisms possess azoreductase activity and some of these dyes are 
known to produce mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds upon reduction (Chung, 
1983). Besides their role in carcinogenesis, the biological role of azo reducti on and the 
impact from these types of diverse azo dyes on the intestinal microbial ecol ogy and 
overall human health is poorly understood. To this end, very little information is 
available regarding the physiological effect of azo dyes on the gut fl ora. 
  E. faecalis  is an important organism and opportunistic pathogen of the gut due to 
its role in food fermentation, nosocomial infections and resistance to multiple anti biotics 
(McBride et al., 2007).  The biochemical and molecular biology of the bacterium has 
been well characterized. The azoreductase activity of the cellular ext racts has been shown 
for Red 2G as a model azo dye (Walker et al., 1971). In addition, an aerobic FMN-
dependant azoreductase gene from E. faecalis  has been isolated (Chen et al., 2004) and  26  the protein crystallized (Liu et al., 2007). Unfortunately, there is not much inform ation on 
the growth phase response and the corresponding azoreductase activity rate s for E. 
faecalis  with different sulfonated and nonsulfonated azo dyes, which can provide 
important biological information and impact measurements for this important inte stinal 
bacterium.  
This study investigates the effect of azo dyes on the growth of an E. faecalis  strain 
isolated from the human intestine. The kinetics of azo dye reduction in the lag and lo g 
phase of growth under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in complex and simple 
media as well as in the cell extracts of this strain was studied. Methyl R ed, a mono, 
nonsulfonated azo dye and pH indicator is a model azo dye used in several studies. 
Tartrazine is also a mono, sulfonated azo dye and is currently used in the food industry. 
Direct Blue 15 is a bis, sulfonated azo dye which upon reduction, produces 3’,3’- 
dimethoxybenzidine, a known carcinogenic compound (Cerniglia et al., 1982) .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  27  Materials and methods 
 
Bacterial strain and media 
Enterococcus faecalis  ATCC 27274 was grown in Brain Heart Infusion medium 
(Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD, USA) supplemented per liter with: 10 g Yea st extract: 
0.075 mg K 2HPO 4: 0.175 mg KH 2PO 4:  0.450 mg (NH 4)2SO 4:  0.045 mg NaCl: 0.09 mg 
MgSO 4: 0.015 mg CaCl 2: 0.002 mg Hemin: 400 mg Na 2CO 3 and 600 mg Cysteine-HCl: 
pH adjusted to 7.0. This supplemented Brain Heart Infusion medium (BHIS) was 
prepared anaerobically in an ethanol-sterilized anaerobic glove box (Forma Scientific, 
Model 1024, Marietta, OH, USA) after sterilization in an autoclave at 15 psi for 20 min a t 
121°C. Modified phosphate buffered saline-glucose (PBSG): 137 mM NaCl: 2.7 mM 
KCl: 10 mM Na 2PO 4:  2 mM KH 2PO 4: 600 mg Cysteine-HCl: 6 mM glucose: pH 
adjusted to 7.4 was used as the growth-arrest medium. To prepare the glycerol stocks , 
200 µL of sterile 80% glycerol was mixed with 800 µL E. faecalis culture (grown in 
BHIS) and stored at -80°C.  
 
Azo dyes   
Azo dyes used in this study were, Methyl Red (MCB Chemicals,  Norwood, Ohio, 
USA; molecular weight, 269.31, 2[4-(CH 3)2NC 6H4N:N]C 6H4CO 2H, CAS registry 63451-
28-5), Direct Blue 15 (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA, molecular weight 992.8, 
C34 H24 N6O16 S4Na 4, CAS registry 2429-74-5) and Tartrazine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, 
USA, molecular weight, 534.4, C 16 H9N4Na 3O9S2, CAS registry 1934-21-0).   28  The assay for each dye under all culture and cell extract experiments wa s carried 
out using three independent replicates and the data is presented as the mean of the t hree 
data points with standard deviations.  
 
Anaerobic azoreductase assay for whole cells 
Nine mL of BHIS containing 20 µM of each azo dye was dispensed into separate 
screw-capped (with a rubber septum) test tubes in an anaerobic glove box with an 
atmosphere of nitrogen. A loop-full of E. faecalis  from a frozen glycerol stock  was 
aseptically transferred to a sterile BHIS tube (containing no dye) and incuba ted at 37°C 
without shaking. After 12 h incubation, 5 mL of this culture was transferred to a 250 mL 
bottle containing 100 mL of BHIS and incubated again at 37°C. The culture was allowed 
to grow to mid log-phase (optical density 600 ~ 0.4) and immediately 1 mL was transferred 
to the 9 mL BHIS test tubes containing the respective azo dyes using a ster ile 1 mL 
syringe and needle (26 G1/2) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in the anaerobic gl ove box. 
For the control experiment, 1 mL of sterile BHIS was added to the test tubes ins tead of 
the E. faecalis  culture. The tubes were inverted twice to mix and incubated at 37°C.  
After 5 min time intervals for Methyl Red and 10 min time intervals for Tartra zine and 
Direct Blue 15, the set of three test tubes (for each dye) were removed from t he incubator 
and 1 mL from each tube was transferred to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube. The samples wer e 
centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 1 min and the supernatant was transferred to a plastic 
cuvette (Spectrocell, Oreland, PA, USA). Azoreductase activity was deter mined by a 
decrease in the absorbance maxima wavelength peak area for the azo dyes using a UV-
visible spectrophotometer (UV-1601PC, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA). The peak area  29  for Direct Blue 15 was determined between wavelengths 500-700 nm, Tartrazine betwe en 
400-500 nm and Methyl Red between 420-500 nm. The concentration of the dyes was 
determined from the dye calibration graph using known concentrations of the azo dye s 
dissolved in BHIS. The pellet from the centrifuged sample was resuspended in di stilled 
water and the optical density (OD) at 600 nm was used to determine growth.           
PBSG was used as the growth-arrest medium to determine azoreductase a ctivity. 
One hundred mL of mid-log phase E. faecalis culture in BHIS was centrifuged at 6,000 x 
g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed and resuspended 
in 100 mL of sterile oxygen-free PBSG.  One mL of this sample was subsequently  
transferred to 9 mL PBSG containing the azo dye and incubated at 37°C. The amount of 
each dye used in the assay was the same and azoreductase activity was dete rmined as 
above.   
 
Aerobic azoreductase activity by whole cells  
Ten mL mid-log phase E. faecalis  culture was added to 40 mL BHIS containing 
20 µM of the azo dyes in separate 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. The flasks were incuba ted 
at 37°C. To assure oxygen saturation, the flasks were incubated on a shaker at 200 rpm. 
At 1 h time intervals, 1 mL samples were removed aseptically and the azoreduct ase 
activity was determined as above. Ten mL of sterile BHIS was added instead of t he E. 
faecalis culture for the control experiments.  
 
 
  30  Preparation of cell extracts  
E. faecalis was grown for 24 h in 2 L BHIS at 37°C. The cells were harvested at 
6000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 30 mL lysis buffer (50 mM 
K2HPO 4- KH 2PO 4 buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol). Lysozyme was 
added to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL and the sample was incubated on ice for 1 h. 
The sample was sonicated for 2 min on ice using an intermediate probe of a Sonic 300 
Dismembrator (Artek systems Corp., Farmingdale, NY, USA). The homogenate  was 
centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was collected and stored 
at -20°C. 
 
Azoreductase assay of the cell extract  
The assay was performed in a final volume of 1 mL and contained 50 mM K 2HPO 4-
KH 2PO 4 buffer, pH 7.2, 20 µM azo dye, 20 µM FMN, 0.5mM NADH or NADPH 
[NAD(P)H] and an appropriate amount of cell extract. The solution was made anaer obic 
by bubbling with oxygen-free nitrogen for 20 min.  The sample was pre-incubated at 
37°C for 5 min and the reaction was initiated by the addition of NADH or NADPH 
[NAD(P)H]. Azoreductase activity was determined by an absorbance reduct ion in the 
first 2 min at 430 nm for Methyl Red, 428 nm for Tartrazine and 604 nm for Direct Blue 
15 using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-1601PC, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, 
USA). The concentrations of the respective dyes were determined from a ca libration 
graph using known concentrations of the azo dyes dissolved in the assay buffer.    
 
  31  Protein determination 
The Lowry method (Lowry O.H, 1951) was used to determine the protein content from 
whole cells (prepared by alkaline lysis) for the experiments in BHIS and PB SG using 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.  The protein content in the cell extracts w as 
determined by applying the formula: mg/mL = 1.55 A280  – 0.76 A260  (Groves et al., 1968) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  32  Results  
Reduction of azo dyes by whole cells  
Methyl Red, Tartrazine and Direct Blue 15 were completely reduced in 20 min, 
40 min and 50 min respectively when E. faecalis  was grown in BHIS anaerobically (Fig. 
3a). The dye controls remained stable over the time course for the experiments ( data not 
shown). Due to an increase in biomass with every subsequent time interval, each dye 
concentration data point was divided by the whole cell total protein amount (determined 
by the Lowry method) for that particular time interval to normalize the data  for biomass 
content. When E. faecalis  was boiled and added to BHIS with the azo dyes and incubated 
for 12 h, there was no reduction observed (data not shown). To determine dye stability in 
the presence of actively growing cells, Bacteroides stercoris  was grown anaerobically in 
BHIS with 25 µM Direct Blue 15. After 6 h, B. stercoris  had reached an optical density 
(OD) 600  = 0.9 but only 20% of the dye was reduced and within 1 h, the concentration of 
Direct Blue 15 remained relatively constant (Fig. 4). This shows that the re duction of 
Direct Blue 15 in BHIS by E. faecalis  is specific to the organism and not the medium.  
Under aerobic conditions, it took three times longer to completely reduce Methy l 
Red and Tartrazine compared to anaerobic conditions (Fig. 3b). Similarly, Direc t Blue 15 
was not completely reduced under aerobic conditions and only 75% of the dye was 
reduced in 4 h. The incomplete reduction of Direct Blue 15 produced a non-linear 
reduction rate that was asymptotic to time.  
To address the influence of bacterial growth phase and the contribution of a 
complex medium on azo dye reduction, the reduction of these dyes was tested in a sim ple 
buffered medium, PBSG, anaerobically. Glucose was added to the PBS buffer as a sour ce  33  of electrons for azo dye reduction. The cells, which had grown to log phase in BHIS, 
were washed with the buffer prior to their introduction in to the PBSG medium. Althoug h 
there was no growth in this medium (OD 600  remained constant over time), the cells were 
still viable because cell growth resumed when the cells, after 24 h incubation in P BSG, 
were transferred to BHIS (data not shown). Hence, the cells are in a prolonged lag  phase 
in the PBSG medium. Figure 3c shows that Direct Blue 15 was not reduced. The 90% 
Methyl Red reduction, which occurred in 20 min (Fig. 3c), was similar to the value 
obtained in the anaerobic BHIS condition (Fig 3a). Tartrazine was reduced by 80% in 28 
h (Fig. 3c) which was significantly longer than its complete reduction in anaer obic BHIS 
which took 40 min (Fig. 3a). The overall pattern of reduction for the azo dyes in PBSG 
was the same as BHIS, i.e. the reduction rate for Methyl Red was the hig hest followed by 
Tartrazine and Direct Blue 15.  The data suggests that the rate of azo dye reduct ion is 
influenced by the growth phase of the cells and possibly contribution from BHIS as  well.

  38  Kinetics of azo dye reduction  
The quantitative rates of azo dye reduction under various conditions are shown in 
Table I. The kinetic rate values were calculated from the linear portion of the  curves. All 
the data are compared to the reduction rate kinetics of whole cells in BHIS under 
anaerobic conditions since these rates were highest for all three dyes. The re duction rate 
for Methyl Red was consistently high in BHIS under anaerobic conditions, PBSG 
medium and the cell extract using NADH as the electron source. However, the re duction 
of Methyl Red decreased when cells were incubated aerobically and the kineti c rate for 
NADPH was less than NADH.  
 The reduction rate kinetics for Tartrazine reduced by more than half in the c ell 
extract assay using NADH and a further decrease was observed in activit y under aerobic 
growth conditions and with cell extract using NADPH. However, in the PBSG medium, 
there was a sixty-fold decrease in reduction kinetics. Direct Blue 15 showed a  four-fold 
decrease in reduction kinetics under aerobic conditions and very low activity in the ce ll 
extract assays. There was no detectable reduction for Direct Blue 15 in the P BSG 
medium. Even when the biomass was increased almost ten-fold for the experiment in 
PBSG, the reduction rate kinetics for Tartrazine and Direct Blue 15 was still  lower than 
the values in BHIS under anaerobic conditions (data not shown). The decrease in 
azoreductase activity in the cell extract compared to the whole cells for T artrazine and 
Direct Blue 15 suggests that most of the reduction of these dyes occurs outside t he cell or 
is associated with actively growing cells. The reduction kinetics of Dire ct Blue 15 is 
more than 90% lower than Tartrazine in the cell extract assays while it is onl y 25% lower 
in the anaerobic BHIS condition (Table I). The reduction rate of Methyl Red wa s the   39

suggests that due to its small size (molecular weight 269.31) and hydrophobic nature, the

Effect of azo dyes on cell growth  
The effect of the three azo dyes, at concentrations of 20 µM and 200 µM, on the 
generation time of E. faecalis when grown anaerobically in the presence of BHIS is 
shown in Table II. There was no significant difference between the generation t imes of E. 
faecalis grown in the presence of Methyl Red compared to the control. However, the 
generation time and biomass in 200 µM of Methyl Red was significantly higher than 20 
µM (Fig. 5c). There was a significant decrease in the generation times of E. faecalis  when 
grown in the presence of Tartrazine as compared to the control. In addition, the fi nal 
biomass increased when the cells were grown in the presence of 200 µM Tartrazine  41  compared to 20 µM (Fig. 5a). The results suggest that Tartrazine stimulates growth of 
cells in BHIS. When E. faecalis was grown in mineral salt medium with 20 µM 
Tartrazine as the only carbon source and monitored over a four week period, there was no 
increase in biomass, although there was approximately 50% reduction in dye 
concentration compared to the control (data not shown). Hence the stimulation of growth 
by Tartrazine in BHI is not due to its role as an additional carbon source. There was  no 
significant difference in the generation time and biomass of cells grown in 200 µM Direct 
Blue 15 compared to the 20 µM Direct Blue 15  (Fig. 5b) . 
 The growth profiles of E. faecalis  in the presence of both concentrations of 
Methyl Red and Tartrazine was the same, but there was a difference in the gro wth profile 
when the cells were grown in the presence of 200 µM Direct Blue 15 compared to 20 
µM. The cells grown in the presence of 200 µM Direct Blue 15 reached log phase after 2 
h while the cells grown in 20 µM reached log phase after 30 min (Fig. 5b). However, 
after 3 h of growth in the presence of both concentrations of Direct Blue 15 the overall 
biomass was the same. The initial 200 µM concentration of Direct Blue 15 may have an 
inhibitory effect on the growth rate because the dye to cell ratio is high. This w as 
observed by the presence of a blue pellet when the sample was prepared (see Mate rial 
and Methods). The blue pellet may signify that the reduction rate is saturated and t he 
non-reduced dye molecules have attached to the cell wall. Since the dye is a large  
molecule (molecular weight: 992.8), its presence on the cell wall may prevent t he 
transport of essential nutrients from the medium to the cell. When the dye to cell ra tio is 
reduced, maximum growth rate resumes. This was observed by the disappearance of the  
blue color in the pellet during later sample processing.   42

  46  Discussion  
The role of intestinal microflora in health and disease is not fully understood and 
currently there is very little information available on the physiological e ffect of these azo 
dyes on them. This is the first study to show the kinetics of azo dye reduction at dif ferent 
physiological growth phases as well as the effect of these azo dyes on t he growth rate of 
E. faecalis.  
  The milieu of the GI tract is rich in nutrients and the metabolic activity of the 
microflora is very high. E. faecalis  is an important and major resident of the distal region 
of GI tract. Hence, in order to simulate a nutrient-rich and complex environment to stud y 
the azoreductase activity, BHIS was chosen. The colon, where E. faecalis resides, is 
similar to a chemostat since the flow of nutrients in a healthy adult is continuous a nd the 
microflora rarely encounters a nutrient poor situation in order to reach stationary  phase 
(Gibson, 1994). Since the microflora are constantly dividing and are metabolicall y very 
active, it was reasoned that azoreductase activity would be highest in the log pha se. The 
current study demonstrated, via kinetic analysis, that the reduction was highest when c ells 
were actively growing in BHIS under anaerobic conditions (Table I) 
The three azo dyes used in this study were chosen because of their unique 
properties (Fig. 6). Methyl Red is a non-polar, mono azo dye, Tartrazine is a polar , 
sulfonated, mono azo dye and Direct Blue 15 is a polar, sulfonated, bis azo dye. It has 
been shown that the functional group in the vicinity of the azo bond can affect the rate of 
azo reduction (Walker and Ryan, 1971; Russ et al., 2000). In Methyl Red, the hydrogen 
of the hydroxyl group from the carboxylic acid in the ortho  position can form a  
  47

  48  hydrogen bond with the nitrogen from the azo bond, thus reducing the electron density 
around it. The reduced electron density around the azo bond may make it more amenable 
to reductive cleavage. Tartrazine and Direct Blue 15 have multiple sulfonic acid groups  
making them very hydrophilic. The close proximity of the sulfonic group and the methyl 
ester group in Direct Blue 15, both of which are ortho  to the azo bond, may cause steric 
hindrance for azo bond cleavage. In Tartrazine, as compared to Direct Blue 15, the la ck 
of bulky groups around the azo bond may lower steric hindrance, providing more access 
for reductive cleavage. A greater amount of Tartrazine may be entering t he cell compared 
to Direct Blue 15, possibly due to Tartrazine (molecular weight: 534.4) being a small er 
compound than Direct Blue 15 (molecular weight: 992.8). Since the redox potential of 
the three azo dyes is lower than the redox potential of oxygen; the data suggests that  the 
presence of oxygen may sequester the electrons from the azo bond thereby reducin g the 
rate of reduction. On the other hand, BHIS medium, which is complex and supports rapid 
growth of E. faecalis , may contribute indirectly by acting in concert with extracellular 
by-products of the metabolically active E. faecalis  to reduce the azo dyes or the dyes may 
be supplemental electron acceptors. Therefore the physiological state of rapidly growing 
E. faecalis  in BHIS may also contribute to the rate of azo dye reduction because 
metabolism and transport in the log phase is high. Currently, there is no information 
available on the effect of the bacterial growth phase on azo dye reduction and our result s 
are the first to demonstrate this effect.   
  Further, the non-polar Methyl Red may enter the cell through simple or 
facilitated diffusion while the entry of the polar dyes Tartrazine and Direc t Blue 15 are 
more difficult because the cell membrane is non-polar. In addition, their entry m ay be  49  further limited in the lag phase (PBSG medium) where metabolism and transport  is low. 
The non-detectable and low azoreductase activity of Direct Blue 15 and Tartr azine 
respectively, in PBSG and very low reduction level in cell extracts may indic ate that the 
high reduction rate in the complex BHIS medium in an anaerobic environment occurs by 
a non-enzymatic mechanism, since it is known that reduced inorganic compounds from 
microbial metabolism increase the reduction rate of azo dyes (Stolz, 2001). R afii (Rafii et 
al., 1990) showed that azoreductase activity in Clostridium perfringens  and other 
intestinal bacteria was irreversibly inactivated in the presence of oxygen, b ut our data 
shows that azoreductase activity in the presence of oxygen was only reduced but not 
inhibited (Fig. 3b, Table I). BHIS alone does not contribute to azo dye reduction, as 
observed in the control experiments which contained dye only and no cells.  
 Majority of the current research in this field has focused on identifying and 
isolating the azoreductase gene from the organisms. The azoreductase flavoprote in that 
was isolated from E. faecalis  was specific for NADH and not NADPH (Chen et al., 
2004). However, our results with cell extract show that azoreductase activity w as 
observed with NADPH as well (Table I). This result is in agreement with an e arlier study 
(Walker et al., 1971). It strongly suggests that there are other azoreductase s present 
within a cell. However, the higher extracellular azoreductase activity obs erved for the 
sulfonated dyes indicates that the role of intracellular azoreductases in the  reduction of 
these dyes is minimal.  
The results have shown that the azo dyes tested did not inhibit growth and 
Tartrazine had the most effect on growth as it decreased generation time  (Table II). 
Methyl Red had the highest overall kinetic rate of reduction under all conditions;  except  50  in the cell extract using NADPH. Azoreductase activity for all three dy es was higher 
under anaerobic compared to aerobic conditions in BHIS. The reduction kinetics for 
sulfonated azo dyes, Direct Blue 15 and Tartrazine was lowest in PBSG; which m ay be 
due to the lack of actively dividing cells in that medium. Thus, the physiological st ate of 
the E. faecalis  cells in PBSG (lag-phase) may prevent the sulfonated azo dyes from 
entering the cells.  
The azoreductase activity of E. faecalis  is a complex process and can not be 
generalized for all azo dyes. In addition, there maybe multiple enzymes and m etabolic 
by-products that are involved in this process. Future work will involve the identifica tion 
of an NADPH-dependent azoreductase.  51  CHAPTER IV 
CLONING, EXPRESSION, PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF  A 
PUTATIVE OXIDOREDUCTASE FROM ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS 
 
Abstract 
 Azoreductases reduce the azo bond (N=N) in azo compounds. They do not share 
significant homology at the primary structure level which makes identificat ion and 
classification difficult. Based on domain homology, a putative oxidoreductase was 
identified from the proteome of E. faecalis  with potential azoreductase activity. The gene 
coding for the putative oxidoreductase was cloned, expressed and purified from E. coli.  
No azoreductase activity was detected and possible reasons for inactivity ar e discussed.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  52  Introduction 
The microorganisms in the human intestine have the ability to metabolize a 
variety of xenobiotics, including azo dyes. Azo dyes are utilized in the textile, 
pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry. Since thousands of tons of azo dyes are 
being used daily, a majority of the studies on the microbial degradation of these d yes are 
focused on bioremediation. However, the exposure of these dyes to humans is also a 
concern as these dyes can be mutagenic and carcinogenic (Chung et al., 1992; Rafii e t al., 
1999).  
Studies have shown that azo dyes can be reduced by rat liver microsomal 
cytochrome P450 (Zbaida and Levine, 1990), producing aromatic amines that are 
activated by human cytochrome P450 such as CYP1A2 (Guengerich and Shimada, 1998).  
Azo dyes can also be reduced by microbes under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. 
Initial studies on azo dye reduction focused on the identification of microbes that reduce  
azo compounds. However, with the advances in whole genome sequencing, the focus has 
shifted towards identifying the gene that codes for the azoreductase. In addit ion, it is 
possible to identify potential candidate genes and predict their product’s func tion in 
several organisms using sophisticated bioinformatics tools. To gain insight into t he 
evolution of this enzyme, a number of azoreductases have been identified in order to 
obtain homologs which support a common evolutionary origin. 
Enterococcus faecalis  is a Gram-positive facultative anaerobe present in the 
intestine. An azoreductase from E.  faecalis , Azo A, has been cloned in E. coli  and 
characterized (Chen et al., 2004). Azo A was shown to be an aerobic azoreductase that  53  was dependent on NADH only. However, a previous study has shown that the crude 
extracts of E. faecalis  can utilize NAD(P)H to reduce Red 2G (Gingell and Walker, 
1971). Hence, other azoreductases may be present that utilize NADPH for activit y.  
 Our interest was to identify an NADPH-dependent azoreductase.  Based on 
common structural motifs found in several azoreductases, a putative azoreducta se was 
identified. The putative azoreductase was heterologously expressed and tested f or 
activity.

Bacteria and media . 
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 27274 was grown in Brain Heart Infusion (Difco) broth at 
37°C under anaerobic conditions.  
 
Identification of protein domains 
 The UniProtKB/TrEMBL database was used to select biochemically chara cterized 
azoreductases. Protein domains were identified from the Pfam database whi ch contains 
multiple sequence alignments and profile-Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for a varie ty 
of protein domains. The proteins containing the domains of interest were identified f rom 
the species distribution list in the Pfam database.  
 
Cloning of azoB gene  
Genomic DNA from E. faecalis  was isolated as described previously (Pospiech 
and Neumann, 1995).  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using genomic 
DNA as template. The forward primer 5’- cagccatatgaaaaaaattatcgg c-3’ contains an Nde I 
site upstream of the start codon. The reverse primer 5’-gatggatccgcgaatca gcgtttgatccgac-
3’ contains a Bam HI site after the stop codon of azoB . Thirty cycles were carried out for 
the PCR with the following conditions: melting temperature, 94°C for 1 min.; annealing  
temperature, 50°C for 1 min.; and extension temperature, 72°C for 1 min using Taq DNA 
polymerase. A single cycle of the final extension at 72°C was carried out for 7 m in. The 
amplified product was observed on 0.8% agarose gel.   55           This amplified product was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector and transformed 
into the TOP10 competent cells provided with the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). 
The cloned fragment was sequenced. The plasmid containing the insert was digest ed with 
Nde I (Invitrogen) and Bam HI (Invitrogen) to release the fragment, which was then 
subcloned into pET15b, an expression vector. The pET15b vector has a hexa-Histidine 
tag which allows purification of the expressed protein. The positive recombinant pET15-
b (pAzoB) clone was screened and identified using colony PCR. In order to express t he 
protein, the pAzoB plasmid was isolated using the Qiagen miniprep kit (Qiagen) and 
transformed into NovaBlue DE3 expression cells (Novagen). The positive transforme d 
cloned was identified using amplicillin as the selection factor and frozen at -80°C. 
 
Expression and purification of AzoB  
 The -80°C frozen NovaBlue DE3 expression cells containing pAzoB and the 
same expression cells without plasmid (control) were grown in 5 mL Luria-B ertani (LB) 
broth containing the appropriate antibiotic selection for 10 h at 37°C. These cultures wer e 
subsequently transferred to 1 L LB broth.  The flasks were incubated on a shaker at 37°C  
and 300 rpm until the OD 600 = 0.6.  Isopropyl-1-thio- β-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was 
added (1 mM final concentration) to each flask and incubated under the same conditions 
for 3 h. The cells were then harvested at 4000 x g for 20 min at 4°C. The spent medium 
was discarded and the pellet was frozen at -20°C.  
 The pellet was thawed and resuspended in 10 mL of lysis buffer (20% glycerol, 
50 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 750 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM Imidazole in  56  double-distilled water, pH 8.0). Lysozyme was added to the tube containing the 
resuspended cells to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL and the tube was incubated on ice  
for 30 min. These cells were transferred to a prechilled 50 mL glass beaker  and sonicated 
using an intermediate tip at 60% output (Artek systems corporation). Five second pulses  
were repeated ten times with two minute incubation time on ice between each pulse . The 
sonicated sample was centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min at 10,000 x g. The supernatant was 
collected and subsequently purified.  Expression of the protein was determined on a 
12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. 
All the purification steps were carried out at 4°C.  Two mL of 50% (in lysis 
buffer) Ni-NTA superflow resin was used for every 8 mL of supernatant in a 15 mL tube. 
Binding of the His-tagged protein to the resin occurred by gently mixing at 4°C for 1 h. 
The content was centrifuged for 2 min at 3,900 rpm using a clinical centrifuge. Th e 
supernatant was collected and the resin was washed twice with 8 mL lysis buffe r and 
each time the contents were centrifuged under the same condition as above. The prote in 
was eluted with 2 mL elution buffer (20% glycerol, 50 mM sodium monobasic 
phosphate, 750 mM sodium chloride, 250 mM Imidazole in double-distilled water, pH 
8.0) four times and each time the centrifugation steps were as above. 
All the elution samples were pooled and dialyzed for 6 h in 2 L of dialysis buffer 
(50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mM magnesium chloride , 10 mM 
sodium chloride and 10% glycerol) and then in fresh 2 L dialysis buffer overnight. The 
protein concentration was estimated to be 0.13 µg/ µL using BSA as the protein standard.  
  57  Native molecular weight determination 
  Discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was used to determine 
the native molecular weight under non-denaturing conditions as described by Laem mli 
(Laemmli, 1970). The resolving mini-gels used were 6, 8, 10, 11 and 12% which were 
prepared in 1.5 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.8. Electrophoresis was carried out in a Mini-Protean II  
unit (Bio-Rad) at 4°C in Tris-Glycine buffer, pH 8.3. No sodium dodecyl sulfate (SD S) 
was added to any of the buffers. After electrophoresis, the gels were stai ned in Coomassie 
Blue R-250 and destained in Methanol:acetic acid:water (v/v/v) (2:3:15). The mobilit ies 
for standards and AzoB were determined. The standards used to determine the molec ular 
weight were lactalbumin (14.2 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), chicken albumi n (45 
kDa), bovine serum albumin monomer (66 kDa) and bovine serum albumin dimer (132 
kDa). The Furgeson plot was constructed with mobility i.e., [100.log ( Rf  .100)] for each 
protein vs. % gel. The slopes of these were subsequently used to construct a plot against 
the known molecular weights of the standards to determine the native molecular wei ght 
of AzoB.         
 
AzoB enzyme activity for methyl red  
 The assay was carried out in a quartz cuvette in a total reaction volume of 1 mL.  
The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mM NADPH. The reaction mixture 
contained 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 50 µM of Methyl Red, 10 µM 
FMN and enzyme. The extinction coefficient for Methyl Red at 430 nm was 23,360 M -
1cm -1. The enzyme activity was measured by a decrease in absorbance at 430 nm over a 5  58  min period using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-1601PC, Shimadzu). The negative 
control assay was performed under the same conditions as above except that Bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) was used in place of the enzyme. The azoreductase from E. 
faecium  was used as the positive control. One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined a s 
the reduction of 1 µmol of methyl red per minute.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  59  Results and Discussion 
Identification of a putative NADPH-specific azoreductase in E. faecalis  
 There are no conserved regions in the primary sequence of azoreductases. 
However, domain motifs were used to identify commonalities between the bacteri al 
azoreductases. Table III shows the domain and cofactor requirements for differ ent 
azoreductases.  A majority of the azoreductases are categorized into one of  two domains, 
flavodoxin_2 domain (PF02525) and FMN_red domain (PF03358) as identified by the  
Pfam database. These two domains fall into the same clan of flavoproteins.  
The AzoA in E.  faecalis is the only protein with a flavodoxin_2 domain in its 
proteome.  However, our analysis showed there are three other proteins with an FMN_red 
domain that have not been characterized yet which are EF1226, EF1698 and EF1227. 
Recently, EF1226 was suggested to be an ancestral azoreductase in E. faecalis  based on a 
BLAST comparison with the azoreductase from Geobacillus  stearothermophilus  (Bafana 
and Chakrabarti, 2008). Therefore, EF1226 ( azoB ) was chosen as the candidate gene 
which may encode for the protein with NADPH-dependent azoreductase activity .  
The genomic locus of azoB  indicates that it is flanked by two genes. The open-
reading frame (ORF) upstream of azoB  is a putative thiamin biosynthesis lipoprotein, 
apbE  (ORF1) and the ORF downstream is a hypothetical protein (ORF3). There ar e 27 
nucleotides between the stop codon of the upstream ORF1 and the start codon of azoB  
and 19 nucleotides between the stop codon of azoB  and the start of the downstream 
ORF3. The 27 nucleotides between ORF1 and azoB  do not contain a conserved promoter 
binding site (TATA box) but contain a putative ribosomal binding site (AGGA).  60  However, there is a ‘TATATA’ sequence within ORF1 which is  approximately 50 
nucleotides upstream of the stop codon.  The 19 nucleotide region between azoB  and 
ORF3 does not contain a consensus Shine-Dalgarno or promoter sequence.  
A BLAST search with the AzoB protein sequence did not produce any hits with 
an azoreductase using a threshold E value less than 0.1. All the matches were annotated 
as hypothetical or putative oxidoreductases.

The primers for EF1226 produced an amplicon of 664 base pairs and the PCR 
product was successfully cloned and subcloned into the TOPO TA and pET15-b cloning 
vectors. Figure 7 shows protein profiles including the expressed protein that was pur ified 
to apparent homogeneity.  
  The DNA sequence of the cloned azoB gene when compared to the genomic 
sequence was identical, however when the gene sequence of this strain was compar ed to 
sequence of strain V583 in the database, the translated sequence showed an amino acid  
residue change from glutamate (E) to aspartate (D) (Fig 8). 
 
Native molecular weight determination of AzoB 
 The native molecular weight of AzoB was determined using 6, 8, 10, 11 and 12% 
non-denaturing resolving gels. The slopes for each protein standard as well as A zoB were 
determined from the Furgeson plot (Fig 9a) and subsequently plotted against molecular  
weight (Fig 9b). Based on these plots, the native molecular weight of AzoB was  shown to 
be 27 kDa. The theoretical molecular weight is 23 kDa. Thus, the results suggest AzoB i s 
a monomer. The slight increase in the empirically determined molecular weig ht is due to 
the hexa-histidine tag associated with the protein. AzoB seems to be similar  to the 
azoreductase of Enterobacter agglomerans (Moutaouakkil et al., 2003) and Xenophilus 
azovorans  KF46F (Blumel et al., 2002). 
  The spectrum of AzoB showed a single peak at 278 nm. This demonstrated that 
no flavin moiety was associated with the protein.  63

Enzyme activity 
  AzoB did not reduce Methyl Red, Direct Blue 15, Tartrazine and Acid Red 88 in 
the presence of FMN and NADPH for 45 min at 25 °C.  The enzyme was then 
preincubated with each substrate and FMN for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition 
of NAD(P)H to initiate the reaction, and no activity was detected. The overexpre ssed 
enzyme was purified using conditions which minimize denaturation/loss of activity ( i.e, 
at pH 8.0 and 4 °C). A close analysis of the sequence of the cloned insert did not show 
any in frame-shift mutations. The same procedure and conditions proved successful for  
another azoreductase, E. faecium, which rules out technical issues that may contribute to 
the nonfunctioning AzoB enzyme. It was thus concluded that AzoB was ineffective as  an 
azoreductase. 
             There may be several reasons that could contribute to the lack of azoreductase 
activity. First, it is not known whether the enzyme is expressed in the wild-t ype cell since 
the BLAST search did not identify any functional homologs. An in silico  based 
annotation of a gene need not necessarily predict its correct functional stat us. 
Biochemical characterization of the annotated gene product is needed to confirm  its 
function.  Secondly, it is likely that the apbE -azoB -hypothetical gene is part of an operon 
and the putative oxidoreductase (AzoB) may require the presence of these other gene  67  products to be active, as this gene cluster (putative thiamin biosynthesis lipopr otein, 
apbE, putative oxidoreductase (AzoB in this study) and a hypothetical protein) is present 
in 11 different species of closely related bacteria which include Streptococcus, 
Lactococcus and Lactobacillus . Third, the presence of the His-tag at the N-terminal may 
have interfered with its function. Although the protein was overexpressed in E. coli , it 
may not have folded correctly since the cellular environment of the Gram-negat ive E. coli  
is different from its Gram-positive native host, E. faecalis.  Lastly, the azoB gene product 
may have lost its functional ability through evolutionary changes.  
  In conclusion, EF1226 from E. faecalis  was heterologously expressed and 
purified from E. coli  but did not reduce any of the azo dyes tested thus far. However, 
using a similar strategy to identify azoreductases based on common domain matche s, an 
azoreductase from E. faecium  was successfully purified and characterized. Hence, the use 
of domain homology is an additional criterion to identify azoreductases but should not be 
considered as the only canon in this regard.      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  68  CHAPTER V 
PURIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF AN FMN-DEPENDENT NAD (P)H 
AZOREDUCTASE FROM ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS 
 
 
Abstract 
 Azoreductases reduce the azo bond (N=N) in azo dyes to produce colorless amine 
products. The products produced upon reduction of azo dyes can become environmental 
pollutants and some may be carcinogenic as well. Azoreductases have been found i n 
bacteria, fungi and mammals.  However, their primary amino acid structure s have very 
little homology, which makes classification difficult. The flavin-dependent a zoreductases 
are grouped into those that utilize NADH, NADPH or both [NAD(P)H] as elect ron 
donors for azo dye reduction. A heterologously expressed azoreductase from E.  faecalis  
(AzoA)  in E. coli  was previously shown to utilize NADH and not NADPH for azo dye 
reduction. However, crude cell extracts from E. faecalis  have shown activity with 
NADPH. Thus, the native azoreductase that utilized NADPH was purified by 
hydrophobic, anion exchange and affinity chromatography. An assay was performed on a  
polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis under native conditions and the prote in that 
decolorized the azo dye Methyl Red with NAD(P)H was identified by mass spe ctrometry 
to be AzoA. Kinetic studies showed that AzoA had a preference for NADH over NADPH  
and its specific activity was more than 100-fold higher compared to the previous study 
using NADH as the electron donor.  69  The K m for NADPH was more than 150-fold greater than the Km for NADH. This is the 
first study to show that AzoA can utilize NAD(P)H to reduce Methyl Red.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  70  Introduction 
 Azoreductases are enzymes that reduce the azo bond (N=N) in azo dyes to 
produce colorless amine products (Stolz, 2001). These dyes are widely used in the paper , 
textile, food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, and are regarded as environme ntal 
pollutants which danger human health due to their role in carcinogenesis (Chung and 
Cerniglia, 1992; Stolz, 2001; Chen, 2006).  
Although azo dyes are anthropogenic, azo dye reduction is observed in many 
organisms by enzymes which include rat liver enzyme cytochrome P450 (Zbaida a nd 
Levine, 1990), rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase (Stoddart and Levine, 1992) and 
azoreductases from the intestinal microbiota, environmental bacteria and fungi  (Chen, 
2006) as well as halotolerant and halophilic organisms (Asad et al., 2007).  
Bacterial azoreductases from various organisms are very diverse and varia tion 
exists even among these enzymes within the same organism (Ghosh et al., 1992). For 
example, very little homology at the primary amino acid level exist. However, a 
classification scheme based on the secondary and tertiary amino acid analysis  has been 
developed (Abraham KJ, 2007). Based on function, another classification scheme has 
been developed in which  azoreductases are categorized as either flavin-d ependant 
azoreductases (Nakanishi et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005) or flavin-
independent azoreductases (Blumel et al., 2002; Blumel and Stolz, 2003).The flavin-
dependent azoreductases are further organized into three groups; NADH only (Na kanishi 
et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2004), NADPH only (Chen et al., 2005) or both (Ghosh et al., 
1992; Liu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007) as these coenzymes serve as electron donors.   71  E. faecalis  is a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen present in the intestine of 
mammals. The heterologously expressed and purified azoreductase, AzoA has been 
characterized (Chen et al., 2004) and recently the enzyme was crystallized ( Liu et al., 
2007). According to Chen et al. , AzoA is an FMN-dependent azoreductase that can use 
only NADH as an electron donor. However, our studies on crude cell extracts from wi ld-
type as well as previous studies (Walker and Ryan, 1971) have shown that azoreductase 
activity involves NADPH as well as the electron donor. This observed activity c ould be 
due to the presence of other NADPH-specific azoreductases or altered activi ty caused by 
the heterologously expressed enzyme.   
The current study investigated the observed NADPH activity from a cytoplas mic 
fraction obtained from E. faecalis.   The results describes the purification and 
identification of a native azoreductase (AzoA) from E. faecalis  and its pseudo-first order 
kinetic rates using NADH, NADPH, FMN and the azo dye Methyl Red as substra tes.  
 
 
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
  72  Materials and Methods 
E. faecalis  ATCC 27274 was grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium 
(Difco Laboratories, Spark, MD, USA). For long term storage, 16% glycerol  stocks of the 
organism were prepared and stored at -80°C.  Methyl Red (MCB Chemicals,  Norwood, 
Ohio, USA; molecular weight, 269.31, 2[4-(CH 3)2NC 6H4N:N]C 6H4CO 2H, CAS registry 
63451-28-5) was used as the azo dye under investigation. NAD(P)H (> 99% purity) was 
from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA) and FMN was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, 
USA). Chromatography resins used were Octyl Sepharose™ 4 Fast flow from Amers ham 
Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ, USA) and DEAE Bio-Gel® agarose 100-200 mesh a nd 
Affi-Gel® Blue Gel 100-200 mesh from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA). The 
chromatography columns used for hydrophobic interaction chromatography and ion 
exchange chromatography were Flex-Column® from Kimble/Kontes (Vineland, NJ, 
USA)    
 
Purification of azoreductase  
 Preparation of cell extract:  A single colony of  E. faecalis  grown on a BHI plate 
was used to inoculate 5 mL of BHI broth. The culture was grown at 37°C for 12 h and 1 
mL was transferred to 20 L of BHI broth. The 20 L culture was incubated at 37°C until l 
an OD 600 = 0.9 (late log phase) was reached. The cells were harvested at 6000 x g for 10 
min at 4°C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mM potassium 
phosphate buffer, pH 7).  73  Lysozyme and DNase I were added at final concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 
µg/mL respectively, and the sample was incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The sample wa s 
sonicated on ice at 60% output using a Sonic 300 Dismembrator (Artek systems 
corporation, farmindale, NY, USA) for a total of 6 min with 20 second pulses and 
phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride (PMSF, 1 mM final concentration) was immediat ely 
added. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C and the 
pellet was discarded. Ammonium sulfate was added at 4°C to the clarified cell ex tract to 
a final concentration of 0.5 M and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. 
Note: All subsequent purifications steps were carried out at 4°C.  
 Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) – The sample was applied at a 
linear flow rate of 8.5 cm/h to an octyl sepharose 4 flast flow column (2.5 x 15.5 cm) that 
was equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7; 0.5 mM 
EDTA; 0.5 M ammonium sulfate). After applying the sample, the column was washed 
with two volumes of 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 and the bound protein was 
eluted with 30% isopropanol. The eluted protein was concentrated to 20 mL and 
diafiltrated with 200 mL of buffer C (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, the pH of Tris-Cl was 
adjusted at 4°C with HCl) in an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) 
using a 10,000 NMWL membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). 
 Ion Exchange Chromatography (IEX)  – The sample was diluted with buffer C to 
obtain a final protein concentration of 7.5 mg/mL and applied at a linear flow rate of 7 
cm/h to a DEAE Bio-gel agarose column (2.5 x 10.5 cm) which was previously 
equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with 300 mL of buffer C. The  74  protein was eluted with 300 mL of buffer C containing a linear gradient of NaCl fr om 0-
200 mM. The fractions (6 mL each) that had the highest azoreductase activity w ere 
pooled together and concentrated to 11 mL.  
 Affinity Chromatography  – The pooled and concentrated sample was applied at a 
linear flow rate of 9 cm/h to Affi-gel Blue gel (2 x 1.5 cm) that was equilibra ted with 
buffer C. The column was washed with 12 mL of buffer C containing 1 M NaCl. The 
bound protein was eluted with 12 mL of 30% isopropanol containing 3 M NaCl. The 
sample was concentrated and diafiltrated with 100 mL of buffer A. The enzyme  fraction 
was aliquoted and stored at – 20°C in 50% glycerol. 
 Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method with bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.   
 
Azoreductase activity assay  
 Qualitative assay – A preparative mini 5-12.5% gradient resolving 
polyacrylamide gel was prepared according to the method by Laemmli (Lae mmli, 1970), 
without the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) using a Mini-PROTEAN® II 
apparatus (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA, USA).  The protein sample from the affinity  
chromatography fraction (0.3 mg/mL) was loaded in the single preparative ref erence 
well.  Electrophoresis was performed at 4°C in Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3 at 6 m illiamps 
constant current. After electrophoresis, the gel was split down the middle and each ha lf 
was placed in two shallow trays. To one tray, 5 mL buffer DH (Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; 0.5 mM 
Methyl Red; 10 µM FMN; 1 mM NADH) was added and to the other tray, 5mL buffer  75  DPH (Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; 0.5 mM Methyl Red; 10 µM FMN; 2 mM NADPH) was added. 
Each tray was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking to assure  
that solutions were evenly distributed across the gels. After the zones of clea ring were 
observed, the center and the periphery of the clear zone on both gels were marked by a  
notch and the mobility of the clearing zone calculated. The gels were subsequently 
directly stained by Coomassie Blue R-250 and using the notch as the reference point, t he 
mobility of the visible protein band was determined. Mobility was calculated as the  ratio 
of the distance of center of clearing zone (protein) to the distance travele d by the tracking 
dye. 
 Quantitative assay  - The assay was carried out in 1 mL cuvettes and contained 50 
mM phosphate buffer, (pH 7.2); 20 µM Methyl Red; 20 µM FMN; 0.5 mM NADPH and 
an appropriate amount of enzyme (1-800 µg). The reaction was initiated by adding 
NADPH. The enzyme activity was determined by an absorbance reduction in the fi rst 2 
min at 430 nm for Methyl Red using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-1601PC, 
Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA). The extinction coefficient for Methyl Red used was 
23,360 M -1 cm -1. A unit (U) of azoreductase activity was defined as the amount of 
enzyme required to reduce 1 µmol per min of Methyl Red.  
 
Protein Identification 
Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-T OF): The 
protein band corresponding to the zone of clearing seen in Fig. 10B was excised and 
washed with 50% acetonitrile/25mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). The sample was  76  dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile and subsequently digested with a solution of 15 µg/ ml 
sequencing-grade trypsin in 25 mM bicarbonate buffer. The peptides were extra cted with 
0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 
analyzed in reflectron mode using a Voyager-DE™ PRO Biospectrometry Worksta tion 
(PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., USA). Spectra were deisotoped using a detec tion threshold 
that was manually adjusted to exclude spectral noise, and the result peak list was us ed to 
search the MSDB database (3239079 sequences) using the Mascot search engine (M atrix 
Science, London, UK). Search parameters included a statement of 100 ppm mass 
accuracy and the amino acid modifications: Met oxidation, pyroglutamate cyc lization of 
glutamine, and acrylamide adducts of Cysteine.  
 Capillary HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectra (HPLC-E SI-
MS/MS): The HPLC-ESI-MS/MS data for the trypsin digested sample were  acquired on 
a Thermo Fisher LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer fitted with a Ne w Objective 
PicoView 550 nanospray interface. On-line HPLC separation of the digests was 
accomplished with an Eksigent NanoLC micro HPLC:  column, PicoFrit™ (New 
Objective, Woburn, MA, USA; 75 µm i.d.) packed to 10 cm with C18 adsorbent (Vydac, 
Grace, Deerfield, IL, USA; 218MS 5 µm, 300 Å); mobile phase A, 0.5% acetic acid 
(HAc)/0.005% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); mobile phase B, 90% acetonitrile/0.5%  
HAc/0.005% TFA; gradient 2 to 42% B in 30 min; flow rate, 0.4 µl/min. MS conditions 
were: ESI voltage, 2.9 kV; isolation window for MS/MS, 3; relative collision energy , 
35%; scan strategy, survey scan followed by acquisition of data dependent collis ion-
induced dissociation (CID) spectra of the seven most intense ions in the survey scan  77  above a set threshold.  The uninterpreted CID spectra were searched against the NCB Inr 
database [20080310 (6298708 sequences; 2152697077 residues)] by means of Mascot 
(Matrix Science).  Variable modifications considered for the searches incl uded:  
oxidation of His, Met, and Trp; Trp conversion to kynurenin.  Determination of protein 
identity probabilities were accomplished by Scaffold™ (Proteome Software, Por tland, 
Oregon, USA). Scaffold verifies peptide identifications assigned by SEQUES T and 
Mascot using the X!Tandem database searching program (Craig and Beavis, 2003) .  
Scaffold then probabilistically validates these peptide identifications us ing 
PeptideProphet (Keller et al., 2002) and derives corresponding protein probabilities  using 
ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003).  
 
Pseudo-first order kinetics 
 To determine the apparent pseudo-kinetic parameters, the concentration of one 
substrate was varied and the other substrates’ remained constant. The constant  
concentration for Methyl Red was 20 µM and the varying concentrations were 2 - 20 µM. 
For NADH, the constant was 1 mM and varying concentrations were 10 - 80 µM. For 
FMN, constant concentration was 20 µM and varying concentrations were 0.5 - 5 µM. 
For NADPH the varying concentrations were 1.5 - 10 mM. The parameters were 
determined from the double reciprocal plot using the KaleidaGraph software (Sy nergy 
software).  
  
  78  Results 
Enzyme purification 
  Methyl Red, NADPH and FMN were used for the azoreductase assays during al l 
the purification steps. The initial specific azoreductase activity in the c rude cytoplasmic 
extracts was 0.003 U/mg.  A combination of hydrophobic interaction, ion-exchange and 
affinity chromatography was used to purify over 200 – fold of the native azoreductas e 
with a recovery of 10% (Table IV). The protein concentration throughout the purific ation 
was determined by the Bradford method. 
 
Native PAGE assay for azoreductase  
 The affinity chromatography purified fraction was subjected to electrophor esis at 
4°C on a discontinuous native PAGE gel. The gel was divided in half and each half was 
incubated separately at room temp with 1 mM NADH and 2 mM NADPH to determine 
which reduced pyridine nucleotide could be utilized as an electron donor. A clearing 
zone, indicating Methyl Red reduction, was observed in both gels (Fig. 10 Aa and Ab).  
The mobility of the clear zones and the Coomassie Blue stained bands on both gels were  
the same which suggested that the same enzyme could utilize NAD(P)H as ele ctron 
donors to reduce Methyl Red (Fig 10 A and B). However, the zone of clearing was larg er 
when NADH was used as the electron donor (Fig. 10 Aa) as compared to when NADPH 
was used as the electron donor (Fig. 10 Ab). This was attributed to a much greater 
affinity for NADH by the enzyme as the electron donor as compared to NADPH. T hese

Identification of the azoreductase  
 The protein band corresponding to the zone of clearing on the native PAGE 
assay (Fig 10B) was analyzed by trypsonolysis, MALDI-TOF mass spect rometry, and 
database searching. Using this approach, the predominant protein in the band was 
identified as a putative acyl carrier protein from E.  faecalis  V583 (AAO82310 from 
NCBI), yielding a Mascot score of 116 versus the statistical signific ance threshold of 78 
(p<0.05). An analysis of this hypothetical protein sequence revealed that it w as the same 
azoreductase (AzoA) identified previously by Chen et al.  (Chen et al., 2004). All other 
candidate identifications had scores less than 78, and were therefore regarded a s 
statistically insignificant. The identification of azoreductase was bas ed on matching 9 of 
16 experimental ion masses, representing 49% of the azoreductase sequence (Fig . 11) and 
these were assigned from the most intense peaks observed.    
 To ensure that there were no other proteins in the sample that may have 
contributed to the azoreductase activity; the trypsin-digested sample was su bjected to a 
more sensitive analysis using nano-bore chromatography in conjunction with ele ctrospray 
tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS).  Tandem mass spectrom etry and 
database searching again identified the putative acyl carrier protein from  E. faecalis  V583

probability for the protein and 95% probability for  each peptide (17 unique spectra

MS/MS and a database search at 99.9% minimum protein and 95% minimum peptide 
statistical thresholds identified 16 proteins based on a minimum of 2 peptides, including  
low-levels of keratin contamination. The spectral count indicated that AzoA was t he most 
abundant protein in the sample i.e., 48 AzoA-derived spectra in contrast to 22 spectra 
from hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and 12 spectra from human 
keratin which were the next most abundant proteins. No other oxidoreductases were 
detected in the band of clearing, even when the stringency for identification was r elaxed 
to include proteins associated with/identified by only one peptide, a minimum protein 
identification threshold of 95% and a minimum peptide identification threshold of 90%.   
 
Pseudo-first order kinetics  
 In order to reduce Methyl Red, the enzyme required FMN and NAD(P)H. Table 
VI indicates the kinetic parameters for the substrates which were determi ned from the 
double reciprocal plot (Fig. 12a and 12b) . The V max  values for all substrates were almost 
the same, but the apparent K m value for NADPH was more than 180 – fold higher than 
NADH. Also, the apparent K m values for Methyl Red and NADH were lower than those 
described previously (Chen et al., 2004). FMN had the lowest apparent K m value of 3 µM. 
No azoreductase activity was observed when the sulfonated azo dyes, Direct Blue  15 and 
Tartrazine, were used as substrate which is consistent with the previous stud y.   85

  89  Discussion 
 Azoreductases are ubiquitous enzymes present in a number of organisms with a 
variety of azo dye substrate specificities. It is important to gather i nformation from 
several azoreductases which are isolated from different organisms in order  to gain better 
insight into the enzymes structure and function.  Since there is very low homolog y at the 
enzymes’ primary structure level, it is difficult to cluster the azoreduct ases based on this 
feature alone. Presently, flavin-dependent azoreductases can be divided into thre e 
categories based on their preference for an electron donor; the first group can uti lize 
NADH only, the second group can utilize NADPH only and the third group can utilize 
both.  
            Previous work (Walker and Ryan, 1971) demonstrated that E. faecalis  cell 
extracts  could utilize both NAD(P)H as electron donors for azoreductase activity, 
although activity was much greater for NADH compared to NADPH . Our work also 
supported the activity of both NADH and NADPH. When compared to a previous study 
in which the heterologously expressed AzoA enzyme from E. faecalis  was shown to 
utilize only NADH for azo dye reduction, it was reasoned that there may be other  
azoreductases present in wild-type E. faecalis .  
 Analysis of the E. faecalis proteome revealed two domains as determined from 
the Pfam database, the flavodoxin_2 (PF02525) domain and the FMN_red domain 
(PF03358). An in silico  analysis of azoreductases has also confirmed the presence of 
these commonalities (Bafana and Chakrabarti, 2008). AzoA was the only protein in the E. 
faecalis  proteome that has a flavodoxin_2 domain. However, three proteins possess an 
FMN_red domain in the E. faecalis  proteome. It was reasoned  that these proteins may  90  also possess azoreductase activity as the azoreductase from Staphylococcus aureus  (Chen 
et al., 2005) and Bacillus sp. OY1-2 (Suzuki et al., 2001) have an FMN_red domain and 
are specific for NADPH. Using a molecular approach, we showed that the puta tive 
oxidoreductase EF 1226 (Gen-Bank: AE016830) was not active based on heterologous 
expression (Chapter IV). Interestingly, this protein has been speculated t o be an ancestral 
azoreductase in E. faecalis  (Bafana and Chakrabarti, 2008).  
 Hence, using a biochemical and analytical approach, we showed that AzoA was 
able to use both NADH and NADPH for activity.  Therefore, we conclude that AzoA i s 
an NAD(P)H dependent enzyme and can be reclassified as an NADH and NADPH 
dependent azoreductase. It is likely that the NADPH activity from the previ ous study was 
not observed due to the low NADH activity of the enzyme from the heterologous system.  
Our characterization of the native purified AzoA supported the association of the 
FMN and NAD(P)H binding pockets i.e., the reduction of the dye occurs by the transfe r 
of electrons from NAD(P)H via FMN (Nakanishi et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2004). It w as 
determined that externally added FMN was essential for activity of AzoA , most likely 
due to the FMN moieties being disassociated from the holoenzyme during the protein 
purification step related to the  hydrophobic column.  Our finding of FMN association i s 
also supported by the crystal structure information of AzoA, AzoR and paAzoR1 (Ito et 
al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007). 
  Kinetic studies on AzoA showed the utilization of both pyridine nucleotide 
coenzymes as electron donors (Table VI). Analysis of the active sites, ba sed on the 
crystal structures for  E. coli AzoR  (PDB code: 1V4B)  (Ito et al., 2006), P. aeruginosa 
paAzoR1  (PDB code: 2v9c) (Wang et al., 2007), human  FAD-dependent  91  NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase NQO1 (PDB code: 1DXO) (Faig et al., 2000) and E. 
faecalis  AzoA (PDB code: 2HPV) (Liu et al., 2007) showed they are highly conserved 
which supports the presence of a NAD(P)H binding pocket. In addition, the active site of 
NQO1, reveals that the NH in the main chain of Phe 232  forms a hydrogen bond with an 
oxygen of the phosphate moiety in NADPH while this bond is not formed in the presence 
of NADH (Li et al., 1995). Finally, it has also been suggested that there maybe  
conformational flexibility in the active site which could lead to binding of both NA DH as 
well as NADPH (Wang et al., 2007). 
 In conclusion, the azoreductase, AzoA isolated from E. faecalis  under native 
conditions can utilize NAD(P)H as an electron donor but its  preference is for NAD H. 
The specific activity is more than a 100-fold higher when NADH is used as the el ectron 
donor as compared to its activity when expressed heterologously in E. coli . To this end, 
the azoreductase activity in E. faecalis,  seems to possess a much higher activity 
compared to heterologously expressed protein, thereby providing more direct act ivity 
analysis of xenobiotic degradation within the intestine.

Scope and Method of Study:  
Majority of the dyes used in the paper, textile, food and pharmaceutical industries  
are azo dyes. Intestinal bacteria play an important role in the reduction of the se 
dyes. Azoreductase, produced by intestinal microbiota, cleave the azo bond 
(N=N) in these dyes to produce colorless compounds, some of which are 
carcinogenic. Enterococcus faecalis, an intestinal bacterium is known to reduce a 
variety of azo dyes. The current study focuses on the physiological effec ts of three 
azo dyes, Methyl Red, Tartrazine and Direct Blue 15 on E. faecalis  as well as the 
biochemical purification and characterization of a native azoreductase from thi s 
organism. Domain homology was also used as a criterion to identify and classify 
azoreductases.     
  
  
Findings and Conclusions:   
 The results indicate that azo dyes are reduced at the highest rate under an aerobic 
conditions in actively dividing cells. Majority of the water-soluble azo dyes, 
Tartrazine and Direct Blue 15 were reduced externally but Methyl Red was  
reduced to an equal extent in the cytoplasmic fraction as well. NAD(P)H can 
serve as an electron donor for dye reduction. Most of the azoreductases contain 
either an FMN_red or flavodoxin_2 domain as defined by the Pfam database. 
These domains can serve as an additional criterion for identifying and classify ing 
azoreductases. The enzyme activity of the native azoreductase (AzoA) fr om E. 
faecalis  is a 100-fold more active than the heterologously expressed enzyme in E. 
coli  and hence data from heterologously expressed enzymes must be interpreted 
with caution. AzoA can utilize NAD(P)H as electron donors for Methyl Red 
reduction, although it has a greater affinity for NADH over NADPH.
