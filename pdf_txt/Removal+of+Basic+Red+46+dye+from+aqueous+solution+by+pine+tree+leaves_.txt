ABSTRACT  
Dyes are complex organic compounds which are used by various industries to colour their product s.These dyes 
enter the water which make them polluted.Today, colour removal from wastewater has been a matter of concern, 
both in the aesthetic sense and health point of view. Colour removal from textile effluents on a continuous 
industrial scale has been g iven much attention in the last few years, not only because of its potential toxicity, but 
also mainly due to its visibility problem. There have been various promising techniques for the removal of dyes 
from wastewater. However, the effectiveness of adsorp tion for dye removal from wastewater has made it an 
ideal alternative to other expensive treatment methods. In this review, an extensive list of sorbent literature has 
been compiled. The review evaluates different agricultural waste materials as low -cost a dsorbents for the 
removal of dyes from wastewater. The review also outlines some of the fundamental principles of dye adsorption 
on to adsorbents.

I. INTRODUCTION  
 
One of the major problems encountering today is the discharge of large volumes of highly coloured 
wastewater (dyes) in the environment which  cause serious health hazard s.The term which we can use for this 
problem  is Water Pollution. Dyes are widely used in industries such as textiles, rubber, plastics, printing, 
leather, cosmetics, etc., to colo ur their products. As a result, they generate a considerable amount of colo ured 
wastewater. There are more than 10,000 co mmercially available dyes with over 7 × 105tonnes of dye stuff 
produced annually. It is estimated that 2 % of dyes produced annually is discharged in effluents from associated 
industries [1] . Among various industries, textile industry ranks first in usage of dyes for coloration of fiber. The 
total dye consumption of the textile industry worldwide is in excess of 107 kg/year and an estimated 90 % of 
this ends up on fabrics. Consequently, 1,000 tones/year or more of dyes are discharged into waste streams by the 
textile industry worldwide [2] . Discharge of dye -bearing wastewater into natural streams and rivers poses severe 
problems to the aquatic life, food web and causes damage to the aesthetic nature of the environment. Dyes can be  
classified as  natural and sy nthetic as explained Fig 1  :

II. DYES & THEIR TOXICITY EFFECTS  
 
 
Fig 2: Types of Dyes  
 
2.1 Cationic dyes  
They are also called basic dyes due to the presence of positive ions in the molecule’s structure. Basic dyes are 
water soluble and they are highly visible in water even at very low concentration. Basic dyes consist of 
monoazoic, diazoic and azine compounds [ 3]. They  are used to colour wool, silk, nylon, mod -acrylic and 
polyester materials. Cationic functional ity is found in various types of dyes such as cationic azo dyes, methane 
dyes, anthraquinone, di - and tri -arylcarbenium,phthalocyanine dyes, po lycarbocyclic and solvent dyes[4 ].Basic 
dye are toxic and can cause allergic dermatitis, skin irritati on, mutatio ns and even cancer [5 ]. Also, they can 
cause increased in heart rate, shock, vomiting, cyanosis, jaundice, quadriplegia, heinz body formation a nd tissue 
necrosis in humans [6 ]. 
 
2.2 Anionic dyes  
They have negative ions due to the excess presence of the OH- ions in aqueous solution.Anionic dyes are water 
soluble and they include acid dyes,azo dyes, direct dyes and reactive dyes. Reactive dyes attach to their 
substrates by a chemical reaction ( hydrolysis of the reactivegroups in the water) that forms a co valent bond 
between the molecule  of dye and that of the fibre[13 ]. Their  removal is the most c hallenging task as they 
produce  verybright colours in water and show acidic properties.  
 
2.3 Reactive dyes  
They contain reactive groups such as vinyl sulphone, chlorotriazine, trichloropyrimidine, and 
difluorochloropyrimidine that covalently bonded with the fib er during the dyeing process [7 ]. Moreover, azo 
dyes represent the largest class of reactive dyes used in the textile industry followed by anthraquinon e and  
230 | P a g e  phthalocyanine classes [8 ]. Azo dyes have the largest varietyof dyes and under anaerobic conditions, the dye’s 
linkage can be reduced to form aromatic amines which are colourless but c an be toxic and carcinogenic [9 ]. It 
was estimated that 130 of 3,200 a zo dyes in use can form carcinogenic aromatic amine s during degradation 
process [9 ]. 
 
III. ADSORBATE SEPARATION METHODS  
 
 
 
Fig 3 : Adsorbate Separation Methods  
 
3.1 Physiochemical Separation Technique  
There are various types of physio -chemical  methods used in the removal of dyes as part of water and waste 
water treatments  and one of them is adsorption.  
3.1.1 Adsorption  
Adsorption process is a very effective separation techn ique and it is considered to be superior compared to other 
available techniques for wastewater treatment in terms of initial c ost, simplicity of design, ease of operation and 
insensitive t o toxic substances [4, 12 ]. The efficiency of adsorption proc ess depends on the physical and 
chemical properties of the adsorbents and ad sorbate. Adsorbent’ s selectivity is based on t he adsorption capacity, 
surface area, availability and total co st. Various adsorbents such as  commercial activated carbon [14], mineral 
[15], Clay [16], agricultural solid wastes [17 -19] and agricultural solid waste based activated carbon [20 -22] 
have been used in the removal of dyesfrom wastewater.  
3.1.1.1 Chemical activation of adsorbents:  
Reagents such as phosphoric acid, zinc chloride, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate and sodium 
hydroxide are used in the chemical activationof carbo n under different conditions [29,30 ]. Alkali hydroxides  
231 | P a g e  and zinc chloride are not preferred due to their corr osive natures and the harmful eff ects associated with 
thedisposal [39]. Potassium carbonate is used as a food add ictive thus it is safe to use it as an activating agent in 
the production of activated carbon. AC production depends on the precursor properties, reagent used, 
impregnation ratio, activation time and temperature. Chemical activation has more advantages tha n physical 
activation because it is carried out in singlestep i.e. carbonization and activation are united at relatively lower 
temperature operation and higher yield [29,30]. Various researchers [20,22 ]have successfully reported the 
production of chemicall y activated biomass based AC (Activated Carbon)  in the dye removal.  
3.1.1.2 Physical activation of adsorbents:  
Physical activation method is used to improve the porosity  of AC (Activated Carbon)  by exposing carbonaceous 
material to carbon dioxide gas, air mixture or steam under high temperature profile. An abundance of pores, 
particularly micropores, were generated after activation due to theoxidation of partial carbon atoms by carbon 
dioxide gas and steam[42] . Physical activation involves carbonization of a carbonaceous material followed by 
activation of the resulting charcoal at high temperature in the presence of suitableoxidizing gases where 
oxidization agents such as steam has shown the best potential for producing activated carbons with high surface 
area and good pore ratio [25] . Biomass based activated carbon (AC) through physical activation and its 
adsorptive behaviour has been rep orted by various researchers [21,33,34 ]. 
There are various cost effective adsorbent that have been successfully  used in the removal of textile dyes from 
wastewater such as pine cone, palm -trees, papaya seeds ,rice husks etc .

3.1.1.3 Mechanism of adsorption  
Mathematical treatment given by Reichenberg  and Boyd  is used to distinguish between the particle, film 
diffusion, and mass -action -controlled mechanisms of exchange have laid the foundations of sorption/ ion -
exchange kinetics [30] . Usually, external transport is the rate -limiting step in systems, which have (a) poor 
mixing (b) dilute concentra tion of adsorbate (c) small particle size and (d) high affinity of the adsorbate for 
adsorbent. In contrast, the intraparticle step limits the overall transfer for those systems that have (a) high 
concentration of adsorbate; (b) good mixing; (c) large part icle size of adsorbent; and (d) low affinity of the 
adsorb ate for adsorbent [48] . It is now well established that during the adsorption of a solid chemical substance 
over a porous adsorbent following three consecutive s teps taking place [21] . 
1. Transport of the adsorbat e ions to the external surface of the adsorbent (film diffusion).  
2. Transport of the adsorbat e particles within the pores of adsorbent, excluding  the small amount of adsorption 
occurring at the ex ternal surface of the adsorbent (particle di ffusion).  
3. Adsorption of the adsorbate ions on the interior surface . 
 
of the adsorbent.

micrographs of FeCl 3coated adsorbents and Se(IV) loaded ads orbents are shown in Fig. 2 . It shows surface 
texture and porosity of the blank and loaded adsorbents. It can be inferred from these figures that the surfa ce 
texture of the blank adsorbents changes drastically after the loading of the adsorbates ..

V. FACTORS AFFECTING ADSORPTION  
 
 
Fig 6: Factors affecting adsorption  
 
5.1 Effect of initial dye concentration  
The initial dye concentration of an effluent is important since a given mass of sorbent material can only a dsorb 
afixed amount of d ye . The effect of the initial of dye concentration factor depends on the  immediate relation  
between the concentration of the dye and the available binding sites on an a dsorbent surface [4] .Normally the 
dye removal will decrease w ith increase in initial dye concentration. This is because for a given mass of 
adsorbent; the amount of dye it can adsorb is fixed.The higher the concentrat ion of the dye, the smaller 
thevolume it can remove. [10]. (a) (Blank )RHA   (b) (Se(IV) Loaded ) RHA

5.2 Effect of adsorben t dosage  
The effect of adsorbent do sage on the adsorption process can be carried out by preparing adsorbent –adsorbate 
solution  with different amount of adsorbents added to fixed initial dye concentration and shaken together until 
equilibrium  time [4]. Ge nerally, the percentage of dye removal increases with increasing adsorbent dosage. 
Initially the rate of increase in the percent dye removal has been found to be rapid which slowed down as the 
dose increased. This phenomenon can be explained, based on  the  fact that at lower adsorbent dose the adsorbate 
(dye) is more easily accessible and because of this, removal per unit weight of adsorbent is higher.  
 
Fig 8: Effect of absorbent dose on the percent removal  
of methylene rice husk activated carbon [49]  
 
 
  
235 | P a g e  5.3 Effect of contact time  
The effect of contact time on adsorption of dye can becar ried out by preparing adsorbent –adsorbate solution 
withfixed adsorbent dose and initial dye concentration for differenttime intervals and shaken until equilibrium. 
Generally the rate of removal of dye increases with an increase incontact time to a certain extent. Further 
increase in contacttime does not increase the u ptake due to deposition of dyes on the available adsorption site on 
adsorbent material [50].  At this point, theamount of the dye desorbing from the adsorbent is in a stateof dynamic 
equilibrium with the amount of the dye beingadsorbed onto the adsorbent.  
 
5.4 Effect of pH  
pH is a measure of acidity  or basicity  ofan aqueous solution. The pH factor is very important in theadsorption 
process especially for dye adsorption . At high pH solution, thep ositive charge at the solution interface decreases 
and theadsorbent surface appears negatively [40].  As a result, the cationic dye adsorption increases and anionic 
dye adsorpt ion shows a decrease [39] . 
 
Fig 9: Effect of  pH on crystal violet biosorption [40].  
 
5.5 Effect of temperature  
A study  of the temperature dependence of adsorption reactions gives valuable knowledge about the enthalpy and  
entropy changes during adsorption [20] Temperature is an indicator for the adsorption nature whether it is an 
exothermic or endothermic process [39].  If the adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature then 
the adsorption is an endothermic process.  
 
VI. CONCLUSION  
 
In this review, a wide range of agricultural waste materials, as low -cost adsorbent has been presented. The use 
of these low -cost bi o-sorbents is recommended since they are relatively cheap or of no cost, easily available, 
renewable and show highly affinity for dyes. The process of bio -sorption requires further investigation in the 
direction of modeling, regeneration of bio -sorbent and  immobilization of the waste material for enhanced 
efficiency and recovery. Since modification of adsorbent surface might change the properties of adsorbent, it is 
recommended that for any work on chemically modified plant wastes, characterization studies involving surface 
area, pore size, porosity, pHZPC, etc. should be carried out. Spectroscopic analyses involving Fou rier transform  
236 | P a g e  infrared (FTIR), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X -ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) 
spectroscopy and extended  X-ray absorption fine  structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy are also important in order to 
have a better understanding on the mechanism . Further more interest should be concentrated by the researchers 
to predict the performance of the adsorption process for dye removal from real industrial effluents.
