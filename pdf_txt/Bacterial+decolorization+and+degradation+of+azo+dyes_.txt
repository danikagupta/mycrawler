          ABSTRACT                         
Introduction  
Water is not a commercial product but, 
Over the last few decades, increasing 
globalization, urbanization, and 
industrialization have causes different 
environmental pollution. Among various 
industries, the textile dying industries 
discharge large volume of waste water 
after dyeing process (Zolinger et.al.,1987). 
It is estimated that around 10 -15% of the 
dyes are lost in the effluent during the 
dyeing processes (Baban et al., 2003). The 
excessive discharge of the effluents from         the textile industries contains toxic 
chemicals such as azo dyes, and reactive 
dyes which adversely affect the natural 
resources, soil fertility, and aquatic 
organisms and disturb the integrity of the 
ecosystem (Mester and Tien 2000; 
Puvaneswari et al., 2006) by alters the pH, 
increases the biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD) and chemical oxygen demand 
(COD), and greatly affect water quality. 
Discharge of effluents without adequate 
removal of these dyes will remain in the ISSN: 2319 -7706 Volume 3 Number 2 (2014) pp. 670-690

A dye is used to impart color to materials of which it becomes an integral part of 
human life. Azodyes account for the major produced synthetic dyestuffs because 
they are extensively used in the textile, leather, pharmaceutical and cosmetics 
industries, pose a threat for all life forms. The physico-chemical method of 
industrial effluent treatment does not remove the dyes effectively. Microbial 
degradation and decolorization of azodyes has gained more attention recently 
because of eco -friendly and inexpensive nature. Microbes could decolorise the dyes 
by both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Further, the efficacy of microbial 
decolorizing enzymes on biotransformation of toxic azodyes has been discussed. 
This review provides a general idea of microbial decolorization and degradation of 
azodyes with various physicochemical parameters and highlights the application of 
these processes for the treatment of azodye-containing wastewaters.

environment and cause serious issues 
(Olukanni et al., 2006). So for, various 
methods were adapted for the reduction of 
azo dyes to achieve decolorization which 
include physiochemical methods (Droste, 
2004) and biological methods.   
Dyes  
Dyes are chemicals which bind to material 
and imparts color to that material. The 
color of a dye is due to the presence of 
chromophore group. They are widely used 
to color the substrate like textile fiber, 
paper, leather, hair, fur, plastic material, 
wax, a cosmetic base and food stuff. 
(Masitah Binti Hasan., 2008). Based on 
Chemical structure of chromophore there 
are 20 -30 different groups of dyes. Azo 
(Monoazo, diazo, triazo, polyazo), 
anthraquinone, phthalocyanine and 
triarylmethane dyes are the most importa nt 
groups (Safwat Mohammad., 2005).  The 
majority of industrial important azo dyes 
belong to the following classes: Acid dyes, 
Basic dyes, Direct dyes, Disperse dyes, 
Mordant dyes, Reactive dyes and Solvent 
dyes. The Acid, Basic, Direct and Reactive 
azo dyes are ionic dyes (Anliker et.al., 
1981).  
Dyes contain atleast one nitrogen-nitrogen 
(N=N) double bond, however many 
different structures exist, For example, in 
the azo dyes, monoazo dyes have only one 
N=N double bond, while diazo and triazo 
dyes contain two and three N=N double 
bonds respectively. The azo groups are 
generally connected to benzene and 
naphthalene rings. These side groups are 
necessary for imparting the color of the 
dye, with many different shades and 
intensities being possible (Zollinger, 
1991). These dyes have different 
absorption spectrum (Table-1) and 
associated with electronic transition between molecular orbital. 
of synthetic dyes are produced annually 
worldwide. During dying process, a 
substantial amount of azo dye is lost in 
waste water (Ollgaard et al., 1998). 
Zollinger (1987) reported that about 10-
15% of dyes were lost in effluent during 
dyeing process.  
Azo Dyes  
Azo dyes are the largest class of synthetic 
aromatic dyes composed with one or more 
(N=N) groups and sulfonic (-SO3-) 
groups with lots of commercial interest 
(Vandevivere et al., 1998; Barragan et al., 
2007). Azo dyes are water-soluble 
synthetic organic compounds. Generally, 
azo dyes contain one, two or three azo 
linkages, linking phenyl, naphthyl rings 
that are usually substituted with some 
functional groups including triazine amine, 
chloro, hydroxyl, methyl, nitro, and 
sulphonate (Bell et al., 2000). There are 
more than 3000 azo dyes which include  
Astrazon Red GTLN, Maxilon Blue GRL, 
and Sandolan Yellow are widely used by 
the textile, leather, cosmetics, food 
coloring and paper production industries 
(Lorimer et al., 2001; Elbanna et.al., 
2010). About 80% of azo dyes are used in 
the dyeing process of textile industries. It 
had been estimated that approximately 
10% of the dyes used in dyeing process do 
not bind to the fiber and are released into 
the environment (Asad et al., 2007). They 
possess toxicity like lethal effect, 
genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and 
carcinogenicity to plants and animals 
(Puvaneswari et.al.,2006).  
Impact of azo dyes  
Azo dyes produce clear and strong colors. 
They are primarily used for colored cotton, 
leather,     cosmetics,    and food.  Azo dyes  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(2): 670-690

belong to a group of organic compounds. 
The azo group of dyes binds to an 
aromatic ring. Through mineralization, 
these dye can be broken down into an 
aromatic amine, an arylamine that is 
suspected to be carcinogenic. Most of the 
azo dyes are water soluble and readily to 
absorb through skin contact and inhalation 
leading to the risk of cancer and allergic 
reactions, an irritant for the eyes and 
highly toxic, if inhaled or consumed 
(Nikulina, Deveikis and pyshnov, 1995). 
For example, Para-phenylene diamine 
(PPD) also called 1,4-diamino benezene or 
1,4-phenylene diamine, is an aromatic 
amine, which is a major component of azo 
dyes. PPD-containing azo dyes are toxic 
and causes skin irritation, contact 
dermatitis, chemosis, lacrimation, 
exopthamlmose, and permanent blindness. 
Ingestion of PPD products leads to the 
rapid development of oedema on face, 
neck, pharynx, tongue and larynx along 
with respiratory distress.   In some cases, it may cause 
rhabdomyolysis, acute tubular necrosis 
supervene, vomiting gastritis, 
hypertension, and vertigo (Macphec et al, 
1975; Young et al., 1977; Houk et al., 
1991; Sunga et al., 2005). Some azo dyes 
are linked to human cancer, splenic 
sarcomas, hepatocarcinomas, and nuclear 
anomalies in experimental animals and 
chromosomal aberrations in mammalian 
cells (Puvaneswari et al., 2006). Benzidine 
(BZ)-based azo dyes have been recognized 
as a human urinary bladder carcinogen and 
tumorigenic in laboratory animals (Haiey 
et al., 1975). Toxic compounds of azo 
dyes readily mix with water bodies and 
enter into aquatic organisms (Fang et al., 
2004; Asad et al., 2007) through food 
chain and ultimately reach man and cause 
physiological disorders such as 
hypertension , sporadic fever, renal damage 
and cramps. Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(2): 670-690

Some azo dyes are carcinogenic and 
mutagenic . They reduce the efficiency of 
seed germination and plant growth. 
Untreated effluents with higher 
concentration of dyes inhibit the 
elongation of shoot and roots. 
(Nirmalarani et al., 1988).  
Malachite green causes serious public 
health hazards and environmental 
problem. So far through various 
experimental observations it is revealed 
that malachite green is a multiorgan toxin; 
it decreases food intake, growth, fertility 
rates; and causes damage to liver, spleen, 
kidney and heart (Werth and Boiteaux, 
1967, Culp et. al., 1999). In malachite 
green-fed mice, apoptosis in the 
transitional epithelium of the urinary 
bladder and thyroid follicles was observed 
(Culp et al., 1999).  
Removal of Azo dyes  
Azo dyes may be toxic to aquatic organisms and are considered as 
xenobiotic compounds, very resistant to 
natural biological degradation (Stolz, 
2001; Perkowski and Ledakowicz, 2002).  
Many physiochemical methods like 
coagulation (Vandevivere et al., 1998), 
coagulatio nelectrooxidation (Xiong et al., 
2001), adsorption (Morais et al., 1999), 
electrolysis (Davila-Jimenez et al., 2000), 
photolysis (Ince, 1999) and ozonation are 
promising in terms of performance, while 
the economic aspect has become the most 
challenging problem. But, azo linkages are 
easily reduced under anaerobic conditions 
(Bromley -Challenor et al., 2000), yielding 
colorless aromatic amines and are readily 
degraded aerobically. Therefore, a 
combination of anaerobic and aerobic 
conditions is proposed for azo compounds 
mineralization (Knackmuss, 1996).   
Photooxidation   
The past two decades have witnessed 
intensive studies related to the light Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(2): 670-690   
677 
induced mineralization of azo dyes 
(Yamashita et al 2000; Panduranga et al 
2001; Subramani et al., 2007). Number of 
literatures reported that photodegradation 
process of TiO2 (Wang 2000; Neppolian 
et al 2002; Byrappa et al 2000; Ding et al 
2000; Tsumura et al 2002), in general, 
occurs with the attack of organic 
substances by the activated oxygen 
species, such as hydr oxyl radical and super 
oxide radical, generated on TiO2 
particulate surface by the reduction of 
dissolved oxygen in solution and/or 
oxidation of surface hydroxyl by TiO2 
(Poulios and Aetopoulon 1999; Carlos 
Gouvea et al 2000). Wang (2000) reported 
the photocatalytic degradation of reactive 
azo dyes in an aqueous solution and 
destruction of several classes of organic 
dyes.  
Advanced Oxidation Process (AOPS)  
Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are 
based on the generation of highly reactive 
species like the hydroxyl radicals (.OH) 
that have a strong oxidative potential. 
These radicals can rapidly oxidize a broad 
range of organic pollutants in a non-
selective manner. The common AOPs 
includes Fenton and Fenton -like oxidation, 
ozonation, photochemical oxidation, 
electrochemical oxidation, photolysis 
using a H2O2 and O3, Corona process, 
TiO2 photolysis, radiolysis, wet oxidation 
and the use of electronic beams The main 
principle of AOPs design is to generate 
and use hydroxyl free radical (HO·) as 
strong oxidant to destroy compound that 
can not be oxidized by conventional 
oxidant. Different approaches have been 
used for the treatment of industrial effluent 
by means of AOPs, like treatment by UV 
(Zhou and Smith, 2002; Stanis Law and 
Monika ,1999), Ozonization (Baig and 
Liechti, 2001, Zhou and Smith, 2002,) combined methods like O3/UV (Hung-
Yee and Ching -Rong 1995, Perkowski and 
Kos 2003, Bes -Piá et al. 2003, Azbar et al. 
2004), H2O2/UV (Georgiou et al., 2002; 
Mariana et al., 2002; Rosario et al., 2002; 
Tanja et al., 2003), Ozone/H2O2 (Tanja et 
al. 2003, Rein, 2001) and Ozone 
/UV/H 2O2 (Arslan and Isil 2002, Azbar et 
al. 2004).   
AOPs present inherent advantages, 
causing them to remain the most applied 
processes for the treatment of waste water 
and they are used as a cleaner, because no 
sludge or secondary pollution are 
generated and dyes are totally decomposed 
to low-molecular weight compounds like 
CO2 and H2O. In addition they involve a 
minimal capital investment and an easy 
and fast operation procedure, with a high 
efficiency in the oxidation. On the other 
hand they can be economically unfeasible, 
because of elevate energetic costs.  
Biological treatment of azo dyes  
Physical and chemical treatment methods 
such as precipitation, coagulation, 
adsorption, flocculation, flotation, 
electrochemical destruction, and 
mineralization and decolorization process 
(Gogate and Pandit, 2004) have some 
disadvantages such as cost, time, and 
release of residues. All these techniques 
are minimizing the toxicity level not to 
neutralize the toxicity (Cooper, 1993; 
Maier et al., 2004;). To alternate these 
techniques, microorganism can be used to 
completely degrade the azo dyes (Verma 
and Madamwar, 2003; Moosvi et al., 
2005; Pandey et al., 2007; Khalid et al., 
2008), because microorganisms reduce the 
azo dyes by secreting enzymes such as 
laccase, azo reductase, peroxidase, and 
hydrogenase. The reduced forms of azo 
dyes are further mineralized into simpler Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(2): 670-690   
678 
compounds and are utilized as their energy 
source (Stolz, 2001). Based on the 
available literature, the microbial 
decolorization of azo dyes is more 
effective under combined aerobic and 
anaerobic conditions (Chang and Lin, 
2000; Isik and Sponza, 2004; Van der Zee 
and Villaverde, 2005; Lodato et al., 2007). 
A wide range of microorganisms are 
capable of degrading a variety of azo dyes 
including bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi 
and yeast (Gingell et al., 1971; 
Paszczynski et al., 1991; Martins et al., 
1999; Kirby et al., 2000; Wesenberg et al., 
2003; Olukanni et al., 2006). They have 
developed enzyme systems for the 
decolorization and mineralization of azo 
dyes under certain environmental 
conditions (Anjali et al., 2006).   
Bacterial degradation  
The bacterial reduction of the azo dye is 
usually nonspecific and bacterial 
decolorization is normally faster. A wide 
range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria 
such as Bacilus subtilis, Pseudomonas sp, 
Escherichia coli, Rhabdobacter sp, 
Enterococcus sp, Staphylococcus sp, 
Xenophilus sp, Corneybaterium sp, 
Clostridium sp., Micrococcus 
dermacoccus sp, Acinetobacter sp, 
Geobacillus, Lactobacillus, Rhizobium, 
Proteus sp, Morganella sp, Aeromonas sp, 
Alcaligenes ap, and Klebsiellla sp have 
been extensively reported as degraders of 
azo dyes (Stolz., 2001; Pearce et al.,2003;  
Olukanni et al., 2006; Vijaykumar et al., 
2007; Hsueh and Chen, 2008; Lin and 
Leu, 2008). Some strains of aerobic use 
azo dyes as sole source of carbon and 
nitrogen (Coughlin et al., 2002); others 
only reduce the azo group by special 
oxygen-tolerant azo reductases.   
A number of research groups investigated the ability of bacteria in metabolism of azo 
dyes. Azo dyes are not readily metabolized 
under aerobic condition, and as a result of 
metabolic pathways it degraded into 
intermediate compounds but not 
mineralized. It can be completely 
degraded under coupled aerobic anaerobic 
degradation (Mcmulan et al., 2001). In 
anaerobic condition, the azo bond 
undergoes cleavage to generate aromatic 
amines and it was mineralized by non-
specific enzymes through ring cleavage 
under aerobic condition. Therefore, 
coupled anaerobic treatment followed by 
aerobic treatment can be an efficient 
degradation method of azo dyes (Feigel et 
al., 1993). Chen et al. (2003) have 
described bacterial strains which display a 
good growth in aerobic or agitation 
culture, but color removal was obtained 
with a high efficiency in anoxic or 
anaerobic culture. Mixed bacterial culture 
can give a better degradation rate than the 
individual strain .  
Fungal degradation  
The most widely explored fungi in regard 
to dye degradation are the ligninolytic 
fungi (Bumpus, 2004). Apart from this, 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Coriolus 
versicolar, Trametes versicolar, Fungalia 
trogii, Penicillium geastrivous, Rhizopus 
oryzar, Pleurotus ostreatus, Rigidoporus 
lignosus, Pycnoporus sanguineus, 
Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger 
have been reported which are capable of 
degrading azo dyes (Fu and 
Viraraghavan,2001; Wesenberg et 
al.,2003).   
Large literature exists regarding the 
potential of these fungi is to oxidize 
phenolic, nonphenolic, soluble and non-
soluble dyes (Conneely et al., 1999; Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(2): 670-690   
679 
Tekere et al., 2001; Kapdan and Kargi, 
2002; Libra et al., 2003). White-rot fungi 
produces lignin peroxidase, manganese-
peroxidase and laccase that degrade s many 
aromatic compounds due to their 
nonspecific enzyme systems (Robinson et 
al., 2001; Wesenberg et al., 2003; Toh et 
al., 2003; Forgacs et al., 2004; Harazono 
and Nakamura, 2005; Mohorcic et al., 
2006; Madhavi et al., 2007).   
Although stable operation of continuous 
fungal bioreactors for the treatment of 
synthetic dye solutions have been 
achieved, application of white-rot fungi 
for the removal of dyes from textile 
wastewaters faces many problems such as 
large volumes produced, the nature of 
synthetic dyes, and control of biomass 
(Palma et al., 1999; Nigam et al., 2000; 
Zhang and Yu, 2000; Robinson et al., 
2001; Mielgo et al., 2001; Stolz, 2001). 
In the former type, the cells produce 
enzymes such as laccase, Manganese 
peroxidase and lignin peroxidase to 
mineralize the dyes (Raghukumar et al., 
1996, Fu and Viraraghavan, 2 001).  Lignin 
peroxidase plays a major role in the 
degradation of azo dyes using P. 
chrysosporium (Ollikka et al., 1993).  
Enzymes in azo -dye degradation   
Microbial degradation of azo dyes is 
medicated by enzymes. The predominant 
enzymes are azoreductase, laccases, lignin 
peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and 
hydroxylases. Laccase and azoreductase 
have been shown to degenerate azo dyes 
(Rodriguez et al., 1999; Reyes et al., 
1999). Dye molecules display a high 
structural variety, they are degraded only 
by few enzymes. Enzymatic processes are 
very promising for the decolorization of 
synthetic azo dyes. To understand the 
decolorization and degradation mechanism of azo compounds under aerobic 
conditions (redox-active), exhibit 
relatively wide substrate specificities 
(Duran and Esposito 2000; Mester and 
Tien 2000). Wide variety of 
microorganisms excrete different active 
enzymes like laccases, phenolic oxidases, 
peroxidases and variety of azo-dye 
reductases enzymes.  
Laccases  
Laccase enzymes degrade the azo dye 
through a non-specific free radical 
mechanism to form phenolic compounds 
and thereby prevent the formation of toxic 
aromatic amines (Chivukula et al., 1995).  
The mechanism of laccase involves the 
removal of an H+ atom from the hydroxyl 
and amino groups of the ortho and para 
substituted phenolic substrates and 
aromatic amines.  
Laccases have been extensively studied for 
their degradation of azo dyes (Chivukula 
et al., 1995; Kirby et al., 2000; Peralta et 
al., 2003; Blanquez et al., 2004; Novotny 
et al., 2004). These enzymes are 
multicopper phenol oxidases that 
decolorize azo dyes through a highly 
nonspecific free radical mechanism 
forming phenolic compounds, thereby 
avoiding the formation of toxic aromatic 
amines (Chivukula et al.,1995; Wong and 
Yu, 1999).  
Usually laccase oxidizes the phenolic 
group of the azo dye, a nucleophilic attack 
by water on the phenolic ring carbon 
bearing the azo linkages (Susana et al., 
2005). During this reaction, cross -coupling 
of the reactive species results in the 
formation of C-C and C-O bonds between 
phenolic molecules and of C-N and N-N 
bonds between aromatic amines (Andrea Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(2): 670-690   
680 
et al., 2005). Laccase preparations 
obtained from Pleurotus ostreatus, 
Schizophyllum commune, Sclerotium 
rolfsii and Neurospora crassa, increased 
up to 25% the decolorization of individual 
commercial triarylmethane, 
anthraquinonic, and indigoid textile dyes 
(Abadulla et al., 2000).  
Lacasses is a blue copper oxidase that 
catalyzes the four electron reduction of 
molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O). 
These enzymes are mainly obtained from 
lignin degrading fungi such as Trametes 
versicolor and T.villoa as well as fungi 
like Fusarium soloni and Cladospora 
cladosporioides.  (abedin et.al,2008)  
Azo dye reduction by peroxidases  
Azo reductase mediates the azo cleavage 
in the presence of reducing equivalents 
like FADH and NADH. Azo reduces 
have been identified in several anaerobic 
bacteria and microflora of human 
intestine. Azoreductase of these bacteria 
exhibits similar function, i.e., reduce azo 
dyes to aromatic amines (Rafii et al., 
1999)  
The azoreductase gene has been identified 
in Azospirillum brasilens, Bacillus subtilis, 
B. stearothermophilus, Pseudomonas 
aeroginosa , and Mycoplasma pneumonae 
(Yasuhko et. al., 2001). Fungi usually 
degrade dyes by exo enzymes like 
peroxidases (Duran et al., 2002) and 
phenol oxidases (Glenn et al., 1986).  The 
ligninolytic fungi like P. chrysosporium 
produses lignin peroxidase (LiP) (Glenn et 
al., 1983; Tien et al., 1983) and 
manganese peroxidase (MnP) (Wariishi et 
al., 1988). Several reports have shown that 
LiP or MnP are directly involved in the 
degradation of various dyes (Paszczynski et al., 1991; Pasti et al., 1992; 
Goszczynski et al., 1994;).  
Manganese peroxidase was reported as the 
main enzyme involved in dye 
decolorization by Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium (Chagas and Durrant, 
2001) and lignin peroxidase for 
Bjerkandera adusta (Robinson et al., 
2001). Some non-white-rot fungi that can 
successfully decolorize dyes have also 
been reported by Bumpus (2004).   
Degradation of azo dy es by azo 
reductases  
Azo reductases are membrane bound 
enzyme that catalyzes the reaction only in 
presence of reducing equivalents like 
FADH and NADH (Robinson et al., 
2001). So the reduction process is taken 
place in bacterial cells with intact cell 
membranes (Russ et al., 2000). In Gram 
negative bacteria, enzyme can make direct 
contact with either the azo dye substrate or 
a redox mediator at the cell surface (Myers 
and Myers, 1992). In addition, some low 
molecular weight redox mediator 
compounds can act as electron shuttles 
between the azo dye and an NADH -
dependent azo reductase that is situated in 
the outer membrane (Gingell and Walker, 
1971). These enzymes are oxygen 
sensitive, so in extracellular environment, 
this reduction mechanism will be inhibited 
by oxygen. Kudlich et al., (1997) reported 
that the membrane-bound and the 
cytoplasmic azo reductases are two 
different enzyme systems. The whole 
mechanism for the redox reaction was 
under anaerobic condition, where as the 
redox mediators depend on cytoplasmic 
reducing    enzymes    to   supply electrons 
(Yoo et al., 2001).   Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(2): 670-690

The direct enzymatic reaction of an azo 
reductase, may be a dehydrogenase 
enzyme that is synthesized throughout the 
cytoplasm (Bragger et al., 1997).  
Enhancement of biode colorization  
Dye degradation was performed under 
microaerophilic conditions until no 
residual color was observed. The medium 
was subsequently aerated by stirring to 
promote oxidation of the aromatic amines 
formed by the r eductive break -down of the 
azo bond into non-toxic metabolites. 
(Franciscon Elisangela et al., 2009)  
The of sodium pyruvate and yeast extract 
as carbon sources on the decolorization 
were also investigated, since it has been 
reported that the type of carbon source 
could affect dye decolorization and its 
subsequent reduction (Nigam et al., 1996; 
Bra´ s et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2008). The 
amine concentrations and TOC were 
monitored during the biodegradation 
process. The degradation products were 
also characterized using FT-IR and UV
vis techniques, and their toxicity were 
measured.  
A facultative Staphylococcus arlettae 
bacterium, isolated from an activated 
sludge process in a textile industry, was 
able to successfully decolorize four 
different azo dyes under microaerophilic 
conditions (decolorization percentage 
>97%). Using a single Staphylococcus 
arlettae strain in the same bioreactor, the 
sequential microaerophilic/aerobic stages 
were able to form aromatic amines by 
reductive break-down of the azo bond and 
to oxidize them into non-toxic metabolism 
(Elisangela et al., 2009).  
Release of textile industry effluent into 
water bodies creates a major threat to the natural resources as well as human health 
and hygiene. Azo dyes are widely used in 
textile industry, and about 50% of the dye 
stuffs were released in effluent and 
discharged into nearby water bodies. It 
will disperse into nearby water bodies.  
It will be dispersed to the ground water 
and leads to physiological changes in 
salinity, unfit for consumption, and disrupt 
the biodiversity by bioaccumulation and 
biomagnifications. The concentration of 
the dyes was increased at the end of food 
chain, which causes tumor, cancer, 
nervous disorder, and even lethal. To 
avoid all these problems, the textile 
effluents have to be degraded to avoid 
toxicity. As an emerging technique, 
microbial degradation is one of the best 
technique to detoxify the azo dyes. Now a 
days, most of the research is focused on 
the biodegradation of textile dye due to the 
environmental pollution.
