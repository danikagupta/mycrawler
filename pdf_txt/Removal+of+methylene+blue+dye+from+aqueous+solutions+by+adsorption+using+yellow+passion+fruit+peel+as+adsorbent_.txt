Abstract :The objective of this work is the study of adsorption of dye solutio nmethylene blue  usinglow cost
adsorbent like neem leaf and orange peel powder. Liquid phase adsorption experiments were conducted. Batch
adsorption studies are carried out by observing the effect of experimental parameters, namely amount of
adsorbents, d ye concentration and contact time. Optimum conditions for dye removal are studied like contact
time required, amount of adsorbent and dye concentration. Spectrophotometric technique was used for the
measurement of concentration of dye before and after adso rption. The removal data were fitted on  Langmuir
adsorption equations. The equilibrium time was found to be 18 min for 2.5×10-5 mg/L dye concentration
respectively. A maximum removal of 90 -95% was obtained  for an adsorbent dose of 0.3 gm. at 2.5×10-5 mg/L
dye concentration The results generated by this work can be used for determination of optimum conditions for
adsorption of dye in aqueous solutions. Dyes are present in mixture form in various Industrial effluents like
Textile Industries, Sewage water, Wa ter treatment plants. This work could  have use in Design of adsorption
columns for dye removal.

Introduction
Dyes are highly colored polymers and low
biodegradable in nature. D ye being one of the
important recalcitrant, persist for long distances in
flowing water, retards photosynthetic activity,
inhibit the growth of aquatic biota by blocking out
the sunlight and utilizing dissolved oxygen and also
decrease the recreation value o f stream.
Numerous studies have been conducted to assess the
harm impacts of colorants on the ecosy stem. It was
found that dye s may cause problems in water in
several ways:
(i) dyes can have acute and/or chronic effects on
exposedorganisms with this depending on the dyeconcentration and on the exposure time;(ii) dyes are
inherently highly visible, minor release of effluent
may cause abnormal coloration of surface waters
which captures the attention of both the public and
the autho rities; (iii) the ability of dyes to
absorb/reflect sunlight entering the water, this has
drastic effects on the growth of bacteria and upsets
their biological activity; (iv) dyes have many
different and complicated molecular structures and
therefore, are difficult to treat and interfere with
municipal waste treatment operations; (v) dyes in
wastewater undergo chemical and biological
changes, consume dissolved oxygen from the stream
and destroy aquatic life; (vi) dyes have a tendency toIndira Khatod /Int.J.ChemTech Res.201 3,5(2) 573
sequester metal ions  producing micro toxicity to fish
and other organisms.2
Methods for treating textile dye wastewaters consist
of various chemical, ph ysical and biological
processes . These include: adsorption, nanofiltration,
colloidal gas aphrons, ultrasonic decomposition,
electro coagulation, coagulation and precipitatio n,
advanced chemical oxidation, electrochemical
oxidation, photo -oxidation, predispersed solvent
extraction, o zonation, supported liquid membrane
and liquid -liquid extract ion.6
The most commonly used adsorb ent for this purpose
has been activated carbon7but, due to the relatively
high operating costs, such as regeneration of the
used adsorbent had limited application on a larger
scale. Recently, numerous approaches have been
studied for the development of ch eaper and effective
adsorbents.4
Many non -conventional low -cost adsorbents,
including natural materials, biosorbents, and waste
materials from industry and agriculture, have been
proposed by several workers. These materials could
be used as adsorbents for the removal of dyes from
solution. Some of the reported adsorbents include
clay materials (bentonite, kaolinite), zeolites,
siliceous material (silica beads, alunite, perlite),
agricultural wastes (bagasse pith, maize cob, rice
husk, coconut shell)21-23, industrial waste products
(waste carbon slurries, metal hydroxide sludge),
biosorbents (chitosan, peat, biomass)13-15 and others
(starch, cyclodextrin, cotton) .16-19In the present
study, we report the use of neem leaf and orange
peel powder as an adsorben t for the removal of
methylene blue dye .
Materials and methods
a.Preparation of stock solution of Methylene
blue dye
Methylene blue  dye is widely used in textile, paper
and carpet industries. It is a basic cationic dye.
Methylene blue  dye [C.I. =52015B, chemical
formula=C 16H18ClN3S;molecular weight= 373.91g ;
melting point =100 –110 °C and λ max=660 nm
(reported) and 662  nm (experimentally obtained)
was manufactured by Merck India. An accurately
0.0373 gm. weighed quantity of the dye was
dissolved in 100 ml  distilled water to prepare stock
solution. The solution is blue in colour.
Experimental solutions of the desired concentration
were obtained by dilutions of stock solution in 100
ml of distilled water.
b.Preparation of the adsorbent
Orange peel is disca rded in the orange -juice and
soft-drink industries all over the world. It has been
used as an adsorbent for the removal of dyes fromwastewater14.Waste orange peel was obtained from
a fruit stall, cut into small pieces, dried in sunlight
for 4 days and po wdered. The powdered orange peel
was sieved and used as an adsorbent.
The neem belongs to the meliaceae family and is
native to Indian sub -continent. Its seeds and leaves
have been in use since ancient times to treat a
number of human ailments and also as a household
pesticide. The trees are also known as an air purifier.
The medicinal and germicidal properties of the neem
tree have been put to use in a variety of applications.
The mature neem leaves used in the present
investigation were collected from the  trees in near
by area. They are washed thrice with water to
remove dust and water soluble impurities and are
dried until the leaves become crisp. The dried leaves
were powdered. The parameters which affect
wastewater treatment, such as dye concentration a nd
adsorbent dosage were investigated in batch -mode
adsorption studies.
c. Estimation of optimum amount of adsorbent
In order to find out the optimum amount of
adsorbent at which max imum adsorption takes place,
1.7x10-5 mg/L of methylene blue  dye solution  was
taken in a series of flasks with different quantity of
adsorbent s; 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5  gm.of neem
leafand orange peel powder. The solution of dye
was kept on a shaking magnetic stirrer for 15 -20 min
at 120 rpm for shaking. Dye concentration t o be
estimated spectrophotometrically at the wavelength
corresponding to maximum absorbance, λmax, using a
spectrophotometer (systronics spectrophotometer
166). The samples to be withdrawn from the
magnetic stirrer at predetermined time intervals and
the dye solution should be separated from the
adsorbent by the help of a Centrifuge. The
absorbanc e of solution is then measured.
d. Estimation of optimum concentration of dye
solution
For the determination of optimum concentration of
dyes, solutions of different concentrations of dye
were prepared. From 1 .7×10-5 mg/L to 3.5×10-5
mg/L of dye solution was placed in respective flasks
with optimum amount of adsorbent s for 15-20 min.
The samples to be withdrawn from the magnetic
stirrer at predetermined time intervals and the dye
solution should be separated from the adsorbent by
the help of a Centrifuge. The absorbance of solution
is then measured. Dye concentration to be estimated
spectrophotometrically at the wavelength
corresponding to maximum absorbance, λ max, using a
spectrophotometer (systronics spectrophotometer
166).Indira Khatod /Int.J.ChemTech Res.201 3,5(2) 574
Results
Rate of adsorption o fMethylene blue  on the surface
follows the classical Langmuir –Hinshelwood
expression and that the sorption of the dye to the
surface follows most often Langmuir sorption
isotherm. In Langmuir –Hinshelwood treatment of
heterogeneous surface reactions, the a dsorption rate
is described by pseudo first order kinetics which is
rationalized in terms of the modified model to
accommodate reactions occurring at a solid -liquid
interface as -
r =Where r is the rate of disappearance of the dye and C
is the dye co ncentration in irradiation time t. K
represents the equilibrium constant for adsorption of
the dye and k r represents the limiting rate of the
reaction at maximum coverage under the
experimental conditions.
The adsorption of Methylene blue dye follows
pseudo first order kinetics. The detection was
realized at 662 nm. The results for typical run are
given in Fig. The absorbance of dye decreases with
an increase in time.

Discussion
The Fig. 1 represents the plot of Langmuir sorption
isotherm at 0.3 gm. of adsorbent which follows
pseudo first order kinetics .Fig. 2 represents the plot
of k valu es at different amounts of adsorbent.
According to Fig. 2 o ptimum adsorbent dose for the
dye is 0.3 gm. And the maximum and minimum
adsorption values were obtained at amount of 0.3 gm
and 0.5 gm. It is obvious as with increasing amountthe active sites for  adsorption of dye increases which
results in an increase in removal efficiency. The
decrease in adsorption capacity with an increase in
the adsorbent concentration could be ascribed to the
fact that some of the adsorption sites remained
unsaturated during  the process and agglomeration of
adsorbent as a result all the surface area is not
available for adsorption process.  In the Fig. 3 the

adsorbent with respect to time is shown and between
15-20 min. got 95% r emoval of dye.
The Fig. 4 represents the plot of Langmuir sorption
isotherm at 2.5×10-5 mg/L dye concentration which
follows pseudo first order kinetics. The effect of dye
concentration on adsorption was carried out under
the optimized conditio ns of amount  of adsorbent 0.3
gm.and the results are plotted in Fig. 5. For
adsorbate, the adsorption increased with increase in
concentration of dye, and then it drops and againincreases. The maximum and minimum adsorption
values were obtained at concentrations of 2.5×10-5
mg/L and 1×10-5 mg/L, respectively. Fig. 6 the plot
of percentage removal of dye at 2.5×10-5 mg/L dye
concentration with respect to time is shown and
between 15 -20 min. got 95% removal of dye.
From the present studies we can conclude that Neem
leaf powder is better low -cost, natural adsorbent as
compared to orange peel powder low cost natural
adsorbent for the removal of Methylene blue  dye.
