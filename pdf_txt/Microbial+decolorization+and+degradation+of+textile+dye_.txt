Wastewater, from the textile and other dyestuff ind ustries containing synthetic dyes, require prior 
treatment to prevent groundwater contamination. The  microbial decolorization and degradation of these 
dyes play a pivotal role in this aspect. Pseudomonas desmolyticum  NCIM 2112 and Galactomyces 
geotrichum  MTCC 1360 could bring about oxidative degradation resulting in decolorization of this water 
insoluble Vat Red 10 (Novatic red 3B) dye at pH 9, at 25° C. The decolorization was measured as the 
decrease in absorbance maxima at 530 nm. The end pr oduct of degradation and decolorization was 2, 6-
Di isopropyl Naphthalene (2, 6-DIPN), which is an i mportant plant growth factor.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The discharge of large amount of toxic waste in the 
environment is a consequence of rapid industrializatio n 
and urbanization. One of such pollutants are the texti le 
dyes which are very chemically stable as these have to 
be fast to prevent easy loss of color during washing a nd 
fading on exposure to sunlight. Large numbers of 
synthetic and chemically different dyes are used for 
various industrial applications and significant propo rtion 
appears in the form of wastewater which ultimately fi nds 
their way in the environment. The textile industry is  one 
such industry which discharges a large proportion of 
these pollutants. Their presence in an environment l ike a 
water body, leads to reduction in sunlight penetrations 
resulting in decrease in photosynthetic activity and thu s 
reduced dissolved oxygen content in water bodies. 
Depending on the class of the dyes, their loss in was te 
waters can range from 2% of the original concentration  
for basic dyes to as high as 50% for reactive dyes 
(O’Neill et al ., 1999;  Tan et al., 2000;  Boer et al.,  2004).

9850515620. Amongst these, azo and vat dyes represent the largest  
and most versatile class of synthetic dye (Keharia et al., 
2004). Around 10,000 different dyes with annual 
production of more than 7x10 5 metric tones worldwide are 
commercially available for various applications (McMulla n 
et al., 2001). 
Dyes on the basis of their chromophore group are 
classified as azo, anthraquinone, nitro, nitroso, 
triphenylmethane, xanthene, acridine, thiazole, sulfu r, 
indigoid, dyes etc. Dye concentrations that are used for 
processing vats are typically around 1,000 mg -1 (Ince and 
Tezcanli, 1999). In order to prevent such toxic effects 
which has an adverse effect on the natural biodivers ity, it 
is essential to free the environment of these colorin g 
materials. Many physical and chemical methods including 
adsorption, coagulation, precipitation, filtration, a nd 
oxidation have been used for the treatment of dye-
contaminated effluents. These methods, however, may 
generate a significant amount of sludge or may easil y 
cause secondary pollution due to excessive chemical 
usage. Moreover, their municipal treatment costs are  
high. Various wood-rotting fungi were able to decolo rize 
azo dyes using peroxidases or laccases. Therefore, it 
may be economical to develop alternative  means  of  dye  94            Int. J. Biotechnol. Mol. Biol. Res.

decolorization, such as bioremediation due to its repu te-
tion as an environmentally friendly acceptable treatmen t 
technology. The sequential anaerobic treatment follow ed 
by aerobic bacterial degradation system has proved to be  
efficient in the degradation of these dyes. 
Microbial decolorization and degradation is an 
environmental friendly and cost effective process (Verm a 
and Madamwar, 2003). Several reports revealed the 
existence of a wide variety of microorganisms capable of  
decolorizing a wide range of dyes (Banat et al., 1996 ). 
The effectiveness of microbial treatment depends on t he 
survival, adaptability and activity of the selected 
organisms (Paszecazynki et al., 1992). Anthraquinone 
dyes like Vat Red 10 (Novatic Red 3B), which are also 
classified as oxazole derivatives, are resistant to 
degradation due to their fused aromatic structure, wh ich 
remain colored for a long time (Banat et al., 1996).  The 
molecular structure of this dye is as given in Figure 1. It 
has a molecular weight of 473 Da (Venkatraman, 1971).  
These dyes are carcinogenic and mutagenic (Itoh et al. 
1996) to humans. Decolorization of anthraquinone dyes 
has received much attention due to their recalcitrant 
nature (Laszlo, 1995).  
This study investigates microbial decolorization of Vat  
Red 10 dye by Pseudomonas desmolyticum  NCIM 2112 
and Galactomyces geotrichum  MTCC 1360  at high pH 
because these dyes are soluble in water only at alkaline 
pH. These can be reduced, in the presence of a reducing  
agent in an alkaline medium; forming a water-soluble  
leuko-compound. The most commonly used reducing 
agent in vat dyeing is sodium dithionite. However, o ne of 
the major drawbacks of this industrial dyeing process i s 
the high amount of sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfat e in the 
wastewater and of the toxic sulfide formed subsequent ly 
leading to bio-corrosion of the wastewater pipelines .   
 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Microorganisms and culture medium 
 
Pure cultures of P. desmolyticum  NCIM 2112 and G. geotrichum  
MTCC 1360 were maintained on solid mineral base med ium having 
the following composition (NaNO 3 0.3%, K 2HPO 4 0.1%, MgSO 4 
0.05%, KCl 0.05%, yeast extract 0.02% and agar 2.5% ) with 1% 
glucose. The culture was adapted to grow at pH 9 in  the same 
medium at 25° C. The media used in this study were l iquid mineral 
base medium having the same composition as aforesta ted: 
 
  
  
A - Initial absorbance; B - Observed absorbance.  
 
 
Dyes and chemicals 
 
The commonly used vat dye for cotton dyeing- Vat Re d 10 or 
Novatic Red 3B was used in this experiment. The oth er chemicals 
used were of analytical grade and highest purity. 
 
 
Decolorization experiment 
 
The flasks containing medium were sterilized by aut oclaving. One 
millilitre of microbial suspension containing 120x1 0 6 cells was 
inoculated into 100 ml of the aforementioned liquid  medium with 
glucose and containing Vat Red 10 dye at 0.01%. The  incubation 
was carried out on a rotary shaker 120 rpm at 25° C for 23 days. At 
every 7 days interval, the flasks were checked for reduction in color 
by comparing with control set of experiments where no bacterial 
culture was added. The decolorization was measured as the 
decrease in absorbance maxima at 530 nm.  
 
 
Statistical analysis 
 
Results obtained were the mean of three or more det erminants. 
Analysis of the variants was carried out on all dat a at P< 0.05 using 
Graph Pad software (Graph Pad Instat version 3.00, Graph Pad 
software, San Diego, CA, USA).  
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Vat Red 10 is a vat dye which is soluble only at alkali ne 
pH of 9. Therefore, to bring about microbiological 
decolorization, the organisms like G. geotrichum  MTCC 
1360 and P. desmolyticum  NCIM 2112 were first adapted 
to grow at pH 9, as both these organisms were only 
reported to grow at pH 7. The adaptation studies wer e 
carried out in a stepwise manner grown in presence of  
1% glucose. It was observed that when the adapted 
strain of G. geotrichum  were grown in the presence of the 
dye and 1% glucose, 45% of the dye was decolorized in 
23 days, of which 35% decolorization was in the first 7 
days, as shown in Figure 2. It can be seen from the f igure 
that the rate of decolorization was high during the i nitial 
period and it declined later.  Archana   et  al.     95

Similarly, P. desmolyticum  NCIM 2112, in presence of 
glucose, could bring about 55.5% decolorization in 23 
days, as shown in  Figure 3.  The  decolorization  pro cess was aerobic as the experiments were conducted in shake 
flask conditions. The proposed mechanism (Figure 4) of  
decolorization   were   as   per   the    intermediat es    like  96            Int. J. Biotechnol. Mol. Biol. Res.

diisopropylnaphthalene and naphthalene, which were 
identified by GCMS as per for “diisopropylnaphthalene ” 
(Brzozowski et al., 2007) “Naphthalene” 
(www.epa.gov/region01/eco/airtox/fs/naphthalene.html 
2007). The dye could have been detoxified either by 
bioaccumulation or by biodegradation (Knapp and 
Newby, 1995; Sani and Banerjee, 1999). The results 
clearly pointed out to the fact that biodegradation wa s the 
sole means of decolorization and thus detoxification. I f 
there was bioaccumulation, then the cells of P. 
desmolyticum  and G. geotrichum  should have shown the 
presence of the dye either on their outside or in the  
cytoplasm. This was not observed from the absorption 
maxima studies. Similar results were observed with 
Aeromonas hydrophila  DN322 and the concerned dyes 
were crystal violet, malachite green, reactive red etc.  
(Suizhou et al., 2006). 
However, crystal violet was detoxified by Aeromonas  
spp B5 by adsorption on its surface (Nobuki et al., 200 0). 
Aspergillus niger SA1 could detoxify anthraquinone dye – 
Drimarene Blue by biodegradation (Muhammad et al., 
2010), Coriolus versicolor  could degrade and detoxify the 
anthraquinone dye Pigment violet 12 (Itoh et al., 19 98), 
Trametes versicolor could degrade 2 carpet 
anthraquinone dyes (Ramsay and Goode, 2004). This 
being a first report of its kind of microbial detoxifi cation of 
such a recalcitrant like Vat Red 10 which is an 
anthraquinone – oxazole dye, by these 2 organisms 
belonging to genera Pseudomonas and Galactomyces . 
The end product of the degradation being a useful 
compound – Di-isopropyl naphthalene (2, 6-DIPN), which  
is a well known plant growth regulator, totally nonto xic to 
the environment. It is even hypothesized that this wi ll 
further undergo demethylation to yield naphthalene. 
Therefore, biodegradation of Vat red 10 as per this  
investigation not only helps to protect the environme nt 
but also produces substances which are of agronomic 
importance.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
