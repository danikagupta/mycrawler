and Related Substances

Simple sugars, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and 
their derivatives, including the methyl ethers with free 
or potentially free reducing groups, give an orange- 
yellow color w-hen treated with phenol and concentrated 
sulfuric acid. The reaction is sensitive and the color 
is stable. By use of this phenol-sulfuric acid reaction, 
a method has been developed to determine submicro 
amounts of sugars and related substances. In conjunc- 
tion with paper partition chromatography the method 
is useful for the determination of the composition of 
polysaccharides and their methyl derivatives. 
OLORIMETRIC tests for reducing sugars and polysaccha- 
rides have been known for a considerable time. The rea- 
gents such as 1-naphthol (33) for carbohydrates in general; 
benzidine for pentoses and uronic acids (27, 49, 50); naphtho- 
resorcinol for uronic acids (61 ); and resorcinol (43), naphthore- 
sorcinol (.%), and resorcinol disulfonic acid (31) for ketoses are 
well-knon-n examples of colorimetric tests that may be carried 
out in acid solution. Such tests as these and modifications of 
them using aromatic amines and phenols (4, 22, 38) have re- 
cently gained added importance since the ext,ensive development, 
of partition chromat'ography for the separation and character- 
izat,ion of minute amounts of sugars and their derivatives (1, 4, 
8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 21-23, 26, S6, 39, 47). Polyols and carbohy- 
drates with a reducing group may be detected by the Tollens 
silver reagent (39, 52), perhaps one of the best reagents in the 
art, of chromatography. Reducing sugars are also detectable 
by picric acid (7, l7), 3,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (5), 3,5-dinitro- 
salicylic acid (6, 32, 48), o-dinitrobenzene (17, 401, and methylene 
blue (54), Tvhile diazouracil is said to be specific for sucrose as 
well as oligosaccharides and polysaccharides containing the 
sucrose residue (42). 
Volunietric procedures involving the use of potassium ferri- 
cyanide (19), ceric sulfate (is), copper sulfate 
(16, 44), and sodium hypoiodite (20) are ap- their glycosides, it is of limited use for met,hylated sugars and 
t.he pentoses. Although butanol-propionic acid-water is an ex- 
cellent solvent for separating the disaccharides (4), the residual 
propionic acid interferes xith the 1-napht,holsulfonate method. 
Aniline phthalate (S8) and aniline trichloroacetate (17) have been 
utilized for the colorimetric determination of sugars and their 
derivatives (2, 3); these reagents, however, are unsatisfactory for 
ketoses. 
Phenol in the presence of sulfuric acid can be used for the 
quantitative colorimetric microdetermination of sugars and 
their methyl derivatives, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides 
(15). This method is particularly useful for the determination of 
small quantities of sugars separated by paper partibion chro- 
matography with the phenol-wat,er solvent and also for those 
sugars separated with solvents vihich are volatile-e.g., but'anol- 
ethanol-water (39)) ethyl acetate-acetic acid-water (26), or 
methyl et,hyl ketone-lT-ater (4, 39). The method is simple, 
rapid, and sensitive, and gives reproducible results. The rea- 
gent is inexpensive and st,able, and a given solution requires only 
one st,andard curve for each sugar. The color produced is 
permanent and it is unnecessary to pay special attention to the 
caontrol of the conditions.

Certain preparations have been known to remain water-white 
after a years' storage, while others turn a pale yellow in 3 or 4 
months. The pale yellon- color that sometimes develops does not 
interfere in the determination, inasmuch as a blank is included.

The anthrone (13, 14, 28, 3dJ 35, 53) and 
the 1-naphtholsulfonat,e (10) reagents are ex-

furic acid in 10 to 20 seconds. This is easily prepared by cutting 
a portion of the tip of a standard 5-ml. pipet. 
Series of matched colorimetric tubes, internal diameter between 
16 and 20 mm. This diameter will allow good mixing without 
dissipating the heat too rapidly. A high maximum temperature 
is desired because it increases the sensitivity of the reagent. 
Series of micropipets delivering 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1 ml. The 
type described by Pregl (41) is satisfactory. 
Procedure. Two milliliters of sugar solution containing he- 
tween 10 and 70 y of sugar is pipetted into a colorimetric tube, 
and 0.05 ml. of 80% phenol (adjust amount according to Figures 
9 and 10) is added. Then 5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is 
ttdded rapidly, the stream of acid being directed against the 
liquid surface rather than against the side of the test tube in order to obtain good mixing. The tubes are 
allowed to stand 10 minutes, then they are 
shaken and placed for 10 to 20 minutes in a 
xvater bath at 25" to 30" C. before readings 
are taken. The color is stable for several hours 
and readings may be made later if necessary. 
The absorbance of the characteristic yellow- 
orange color is measured at 490 nip for hexoses 
and 480 nip for pentoses and uronic acids. 
Blanks are prepared by substituting distilled 
water for the sugar solution. The amount of 
sugar may then be determined bj. reference to 
a standard curve previously constructed for 
the particular sugar under esamination. 
All soliitions are prepared in triplicate to 
mininiizc errors resulting from accidental con- 
tamination \vith cellulose lint. If it is desired to avoid the use of niicaro- 
pipets, the phenol may be added as a 5% solu- 
tion in v;ater. The amounts of reactants are 
then: 1 or 2 nil. of sugar solution, 1 ml. of 
5% phrnol in n-ater, and 5 ml. of concentrated 
sulfuric acid. -All other steps are the same as 
above.

The experimental data for the various carbohydrates, esrept,

calculating the value of a,, the absorbance index, in the equation 
9, = a,bc (Table I). The absorbance, A,, is a dimensionless 
ratio equal to log,, __ where I' is per cent transmittance,

teristic for each of t'he sugars described (9, 26). The pentoses, 
methylpentoses, and uronic acids have an absorption maximum 
at 4S0 mp, while hexoses and their met'hylated derivatives have 
an absorption maximum at 485 to 490 mp. Certain of the met,h- 
ylat,ed pentose sugars and their methyl glycosides show select,ive 
absorption at about 415 to 420 mp (Figure 8) and for this reason 
the colorimetric det,erminat,ion of 2:3,5-tri-o-methjd-~-arabinose

The D-xylose and furfural curves are very similar. Assuming 
t,hat the amount of color is proportional to the amount of fur- 
furnl present or produced, the conversion of D-xylose to furfural 
under t,he conditions of the test is 93% of theory.

EFFECT OF VARIABLE AivousTs OF PHEYOL. The intensity 
of the color is a function of the amount of phenol added. As 
the amount of phenol is increased, the absorbance increases to 
a maximum and then usually falls off (Figures 9 and IO). When a 
paper chromatographic separation has been effected using phenol 
as a solvent, it \?-ill be found impractical to remove all of the phe- 
nol developer by air drying. This is not essential, though, 
because the curve of absorbance ts. amount of phenol is relatively 
flat after the maximum color intensity has been reached. Re- 
producible results can be obtained by operating at either side of 
the peak or at the peak as long as the amount of phenol added 
is controlled This could conceivably form the basis for the 
analysis of mixtures of sugars-for instance, of D-mannose and 
n-glucose-by making txo series of experiments, one at lox and 
one at high phenol concentrations. The difference in readings 
is not large enough by itself except for rather crude estimations] 
but in combination with the variation in IT ave length of absorp- 
tion maxima peaks between pentoses or uronic acids and hexoses, 
a satisfactory analysis might be devised. 
A procedure using a somewhat similar idea, the rate of color 
development betn een sugars and the anthrone reagent, has been 
reported by Koehler (28).

EFFECT OF BASD WIDTH. The absorbance, as is generally 
true in colorimetric determinations, is a function of the length of 
light path as well as the band width of the light source. As the 
band width becomes narrower, the observed absorbance becomes 
greater. If the values of the constant a, are calculated from the 
equation A, = a,bc, the effect of the band v-idth becomes ap- 
parent (Table 11). 354 ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY 
The higher the value of a,, the more sensitive is the instrument. 
On this basis, the Beckman was the most sensitive instrument 
used; the others, however, perform well enough for routine 
analysis. 
In the case of the Evelyn and the Coleman colorimeters, the 
value of a, is not constant. This means that the plot of con- 
centration us. absorbance is not linear at the higher concen- 
trations; however, it is very nearly linear at lower concen- 
trations. The linearity of the plot of absorbance us. concentra- 
tion is extended to higher regions of concentration by operating 
at narrower band widths. The points obtained in the nonlinear 
region with the colorimeters passing wider bands are, neverthe- 
less, reproducible (Table 11). 
ACCURACY OF hlETHOD. Under the proper conditions, the 
method can be expected to be accurate to within 2~2%. This 
figure was obtained by plotting the results obtained by use of 
the Beckman hlodel DU spectrophotometer and comparing 
the amount of sugar actually present with that indicated by the 
plot. As mentioned previously, the narrow band width of the 
Beckman spectrophotometer makes it possible to extend the 
linearity of the standard curve. The percentage error is shom-n 
in Table 111.

Conclusions. The phenol-sulfuric acid method can be used to 
give reliable estimations of the sugar content of pure solutions. 
The colors produced are unusually stable, and possess a definite 
absorption peak. The amount of color produced at a constant 
phenol concentration is proportional to the amount of sugar 
present. The standard curves obtained by plotting the sugar 
concentration us. the absorbance can be readily reproduced and, 
because of this, only one standard curve need be prepared for a 
given sugar. Furthermore, the reagents are inexpensive, stable, 
and readily available. 
QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SUGARS BY PAPER 
CHROMATOGRAPHY 
The application of qualitative paper chromatography to the 
separation of sugar mixtures has been extended to the field of 
quantitative analysis. Any sugars that can be separated by 
the technique of paper chromatography can be determined 
quantitatively by the colorimetric technique just described after 
elution from the paper (IS, 15, 29). The principle is simple, 
but certain factors complicate the analysis. Probably the most 
serious of these is that carbohydrate impurities are extracted 
from the paper along with the sugar to be analyzed. This 
source of error is reduced greatly by the simple expedient of 
running a blank. The size of the blank reading may be reduced 
to about one half by washing the papers with distilled water 
containing about 1 % ammonia (37). Another complicating 
factor is the introduction of cellulose lint during the elution pro- 
cedure, but this can be eliminated entirely by careful filtration. 
A procedure similar to the one described herein is reported by 
Dimler and others (13). However, their elution procedure is 
considerably more complicated than the one used in this 
work. Furthermore, the best colorimetric technique at the dis- 
posal of these workers was the anthrone method, the disadvan- 
tages of which have already been explained. Washing of Paper. The following experiment illustrates how 
the soluble carbohydrate fraction present in filter paper may be 
reduced by washing. This fraction cannot be entirely washed 
out (24), and seems to increase after the washed paper is allowed 
to dry (46). Other work (24) in this laboratory has shown that 
the soluble carbohydrate fraction of filter paper is of the nature 
of a pentosan. The further study of this carbohydrate material 
will form the subject of another communication.

A piece of Whatman No. 1 filter paper 22 X 4 inches was 
washed with distilled water containing 0.5% ammonia and dried 
for 24 hours. The pa er was added to a beaker containing 20 ml. 
of distilled water anf allowed to stand with occasional shaking 
for 20 minutes. The solution was filtered through a plug of glass 
wool and a 2-mi. aliquot of it was transferred to a colorimeter 
tube. Forty milligrams of phenol was added as an 80% solution 
of phenol in water and then 5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. 
The absorbance of the solution was determined with an Evelyn 
colorimeter. 
The solutions from the washed and unwashed papers showed 
absorbances of 0.03 and 0.06, respectively. 
Procedure. Two sheets of Whatman So. 1 filter paper 8 X 22 
inches are prepared as described below. One of the sheets is 
used as a blank. Before placing any sugars on the paper, lines 
are drawn as follows: Two lines are drawn lengthwise 1.5 inches 
from the edge of the paper. Two more lines are drawn, the first 
1 inch from the top and the second 3.5 inches from the top. The 
sugars to be analyzed are placed on the paper along the 3.5-inch 
line. The two strips 1.5 inches from the edge are marking strips, 
which will be cut off and sprayed with p-anisidine or p-phenetidine 
trichloroacetate or ammoniacal silver nitrate after development 
of the chromatogram. The appearance of the spots marks the 
distance the sugars have traveled in the marking strips and the 
unsprayed center section. The amount of sugar added to the 
marking strip is not critical as long as enough is present to give 
a s ot xith the spray reagent. However, the amount of sugars 
adfed to the 5-inch center section of the paper must be accurately 
measured if it is desired to determine the absolute amounts of 
sugars as well as the relative amounts in the mixture. 
A margin of at least 0.5 inch should be allowed, leaving 4 
inches in the center to which a measured amount of sugar solution 
can be added from a micropipet. 
The amount of sugar which can be added before overlapping of 
the spots occurs should be determined for each type of analysis. 
This can be done by putting graded amounts of sugar on several 
papers, drying, then developing with solvent, drying, and then 
spraying the entire paper. This will show whether the sugars VOLUME 28, NO. 3, MARCH 1956 
move in discrete bands, and how much margin should be allowed 
along the edges. The larger the amount of sugars which can be 
added, the less significance the blank will have. In most cases 
about 600 to 1000 y of sugar should be added. Dimler and others 
(IS) recommend that another paper be prepared to counteract 
the variations in delivery that may occur with micropipets. To 
this paper they add standard amounts of known sugars, using 
the same pipet and the same technique. This procedure does 
not, of course, eliminate the need for a blank determination, 
because the presence of the soluble carbohydrate fraction in the 
filter paper will have a relatively greater effect at low sugar con- 
centrations. After the sugars have been added to the paper, the 
chromatograms are developed for a long enough period so that 
the sugars to be analyzed are clearly separated. After the 
chromatogram has been dried in the air, the side marking strips 
are cut off and sprayed to show the location of the sugars in the 
center section. The center unsprayed portion of the chromato- 
gram is then cut up into sections corresponding to the locations of 
the sugar. Each section is transferred to Petri dishes, beakers, or 
other suitable containers that can be covered or closed. The 
blank paper is cut up to correspond to the area and location of 
the sugars of the other paper. Twenty milliliters of distilled 
water is added to each of the Petri dishes, which are then covered 
and allowed to stand for 30 minutes with occasional shaking. 
During this time the sugar becomes equally distributed through- 
out the liquid and solid phases (water and cellulose). The eluate 
is filtered through glass wool and the concentration of sugars 
determined as described before, with the important difference 
that the absorbance of the blank reading is subtracted from that 
corresponding to the sugar before referring to the standard curve. 
Results. EFFICIEXCY OF EXTRACTIO% OF SUGARS FROM FILTER 
PAPER. This is illustrated by two typical euperiments: 
1. With a micropipet, 0.102 ml. of a solution containing 4.52 
mg. of D-fructose was added to a piece of Whatman No. 1 paper 
(3 X 5 inches). The paper was allowed to dry in the air for 24 
hours and then soaked in 20 ml. of distilled water for 0.5 hour to 
extract the sugar. (In another series of experiments it was found 355

The extract was filtered through glass wool and a 2-ml. aliquot 
of the filtrate added to 20 ml. of water. Two milliliters of this 
diluted solution was treated with 258.4 pl. of 80% aqueous phenol, 
followed by 5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The observed 
absorbance at 490 mp was 0.548 and 0.538. 
In a blank experiment a piece of paper of identical size was 
extracted for 0.5 hour with 20 ml. of water. A 2-ml. aliquot was 
treated with phenol and sulfuric acid as described above. The 
absorbance was 0.10 (average of three results). Hence, the ab-

Corrected absorbance for the sugar determination = 0.54 - 
0.01 = 0.53. From the standard curve for fructose, an absorb-

2. A similar experiment carried out with D-glucose (400 y) 
added to a piece of paper (2 X 2 inches) gave a recovery of 100%. 
Additional experiments with D-mannose, D-xylose, and L-arabi- 
nose, and xith methylated sugars such as 2,3,4,6-tetra-o-methyl-, 
2,3,6-tri-o-methyl-, and 2,3-di-o-methy1-~-glucose with and 
without solvent migration using phenol-water, butanol-ethanol- 
water, and methyl ethyl ketone-water azeotrope gave recoveries 
of 95 to 100%. 
ANALYSIS OF A SYXTHETIC MIXTURE OF SUGARS. (1) A solu- 
tion containing D-fructose (3.18 mg.) and D-glucose (0.20 mg.) 
was transferred to a piece of Whatman No. 1 paper (8 X 22 
inches) as described previously. The chromatogram was de- 
veloped for 24 hours by use of phenol saturated with water as the 
solvent. The paper was removed from the chromatographic 
chamber and allon-ed to dry for 24 hours. The marginal strips 
were cut off and sprayed with p-anisidine trichloroacetic acid 
reagent (small amounts of phenol do not interfere). After re- 
assembling the chromatogram, the best line of demarcation was 
drawn between the two spots and the sections were cut out (glu- 
cose, 6 to 8.5 inches, fructose, 8.5 to 11 inches from the starting 
line), together with the corresponding blanks as previously de- 
scribed. The pieces of paper containing the two sugars and the 
tn-o blanks were extracted and filtered. The concentration of 
the two sugars vias then determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid 
reagent, reference being made to standard curves for glucose and 
fructose. The results mere as follows:

The close agreement is fortuituous, but numerous experiments 
with miytures of methylated and unmethylated sugars have shown 
that recoveries of 100 In the 
above experiment the recoveries were not so good as expected, 
but it is believed that this is due to the fact that the sugar 
bands with Whatman No. 3 are less compact than those with 
Whatman KO. I; for this reason the No. 1 paper is preferred. 5% or better are to be expected.

Conclusions. The phenol-sulfuric acid method can be applied 
to the analysis of any mixtures of sugars and their methyl deriva- 
tives that are amenable to separation by paper chromatography. 
Thus it has been applied to the analysis of mixtures of methyl 
sugars separated on paper by butanol-ethanol-water or methyl 
ethyl ketone-water azeotrope. The method has also proved of 
value for the analysis of hydrolyzates of oligosaccharides; of 
polysaccharides such as starch (Table IV), glycogen, plant gums, 
and hemicelluloses (15); and for the determination of the amount 
of sugar in urine and in blood.

After publication of the article on “Digester and Filter for
