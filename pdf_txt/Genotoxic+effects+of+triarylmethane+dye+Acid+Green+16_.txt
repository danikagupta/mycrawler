Abstract. Genotoxic effect of synthetic triarylmethane dye (Acid Green 16) was evaluated in Balb 
C mice fed nutritionally adequate liquid diet (1 kcal/ml) or isocaloric alcoholic diet containing 5% 
(w/v) ethanol (36% of total calories) for 6 days. Dye compound was given intraperitoneally at dose 
150 mg/kg body wt. 30 h before test. The micronucleus test was used for evaluation of genotoxicity 
of the dye. The level of cytochrome P —450 and the activity of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase 
(ECOD) and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) in microsomes were determined to assess the 
metabolic efficiency of the microsomal system. Acid Green 16 dye provoked an increased frequency 
of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow and ethanol enhanced this genotoxic 
effect through induction of cytochrome P —4502E1 and stimulation of activities of microsomal 
monooxygenases (ECOD and EROD), presumably catalyziung bioactivation of the dye.
IN TRO D U CTIO N
Epidemiological and clinical studies provide evidence that ethanol abuse is an 
im portant factor contributing to human cancer (12,13,22,32). It is worth noting that 
combined effect of ethanol ingestion and exposure to some potentially carcinogenic 
chemicals results in farther increase of cancer risk. Ethanol potentiates the 
carcinogenic effect of such chemicals as N-nitrozopyrrolidyne (15), dimethylhyd- 
razine (26), N —  nitrosamines and benzo(a)pyrene ( 8). Although ethanol alone does 
not lead to the development of tumors in experimental animals, it is reasonable to 
assume that alcohol consumption may be an important factor of chemically 
provoked carcinogenesis through stimulation of metabolic pathway for activation of 
procarcinogens/promutagens (11). Chemical carcinogens are usually chemically

inert and require metabolic activation by cellular enzymes to exert their detrimental 
effect. Thus, chemical carcinogens need metabolic activation via cytochrome P —  450 
monooxygenases to generate reactive electrophiles capable of covalently binding to 
cellular macromolecules; the process may result in carcinogenic cell transformation 
owing to mutations in genes encoding enzymes or factors controlling cell division 
such as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (7). The prime mechanism through 
which ethanol mediates the conversion of procarcinogens to their reactive species is 
associated with stimulatory effect of ethanol on microsomal monooxygenases via 
induction of specific cytochrome P —  4502E1 which catalyzes biotransformation of 
broad spectrum of industrial xenobiotics, thereby, more efficient transformation of 
procarcinogens/promutagens into ultimate carcinogenic/mutagenic forms (7). Stimu­
lation of microsomal enzymes by ethanol accelerates metabolic activation of such 
genotoxic agents as aromatic amines ( 1 0), aliphatic dialkyl-nitrosamines ( 6) and 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzo(a)pyrene (18).
The cytochrome P —450 monooxygenase systems generate superoxide, hydro­
gen peroxide, single oxygen and a hydroxyl-like radicals, which can participate in 
xenobiotics activation mechanism, oxidative DNA damage and chemical car­
cinogenesis (31).
Chronic ethanol administration induces cytochrome P —4502E1 (CYP2E1) and 
favours the microsomal free radical generation. Accumulation of active oxygen 
metabolites results in oxidative stress. Such oxidative stress is potentiated when 
various xenobiotics are administered together with ethanol. These effects appear to 
result from the unique capacity of the ethanol inducible CYP2E1 to activate 
xenobiotic agents via free radical mechanism (11, 34).
Triarylmethane dyes (e.g. Acid Green 16) are recognized as animal and human 
carcinogens (5). There is no evidence that would make clear whether carcino- 
genic/genotoxic effects of the compounds was produced by the dye itself or by its 
reactive, electrophilic metabolites. On the basis of chemical structure of the dye Acid 
Green 16, one may expect that the dye undergoes oxidative demethylation followed 
by reduction in microsomal enzyme system (20). Although the first step of the process 
represents the detoxification reaction, the further step leads to metabolic activation 
resulting in a more toxic derivative(s) (5). Moreover, in the course of biotransforma­
tion of the dye free radical species may be formed. Whether free radicals are involved 
in the cytotoxic effect of triarylmethane dyes remains to be elucidated.
In the present study it was assumed that ethanol preinduction may enhance the 
rate of biotransformation/bioactivation of an industrial triarylmethane dye, Acid 
Green 16, and in consequence its genotoxicity.
The aim of the study was: (1) to assess the genotoxic effect of triarylmethane dye, 
Acid Green 16, superimposed on a sustained ethanol intake in order to attain higher 
metabolic capacity of the liver via induction of microsomal monooxygenase system; 
(2) to find out whether the increased genotoxicity of the dye was related to inductive 
effect of ethanol on microsomal cytochrome P — 450 monooxygenase system 
responsible for biotransformation of the dye to reactive, more toxic metabolites.
The study revealed high inductive potential of ethanol liquid diet on the 
cytochrome P —450 system and related enhancement of the genotoxic effect of Acid 
Green 16 dye in mice, probably via activation mechanisms.
Genotoxicity of triarylmethane dye 369
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Animals and treatment
Male Balb C mice 9 weeks old (20 —  22 g) were acclimatized for 5 days in groups 
and fed laboratory chow Murigran and tap water ad libitum. Afterwards the mice 
were fed for 6 days either nutritionally adequate liquid diet prepared on the basis of 
Portagen (Polfa, licence of Mead Johnson BV) and containing 17% proteins, 22% 
fat, 54% carbohydrates, vitamins and trace elements or isocaloric ethanol liquid diet 
containing 5% (w/v) ethanol and representing 36% of total calories. The control diet 
and ethanol diet contained 1  kcal/ml corresponding to 4.2 kJ/ml (4,7). The mice 
consumed daily, on average, 21 g ethanol/kg body weight. In the morning (8.00 a.m.) 
on 5th day of feeding of liquid diet and isocaloric ethanol diet, the mice were given 
intraperitoneally either Acid Green 16 dye at dose 150 mg/kg body weight or 
physiological saline as reference control and sacrificied for test 30 h thereafter. The 
following experimental groups were analysed: control, ethanol, Acid Green 16, 
ethanol +  Acid Green 16. As a reference two additional treatments were included: 
(1) Phenobarbital sodium —  classic inducer of cytochrome P —450 (CYP2B6) 
monooxygenases —  0.05% water solution as the only drink for 9 days; (2) 
Mitomycin C —  positive control for genotoxic effect —  single intraperitoneal 
injection at dose 2.5 mg/kg body wt, 30 h before test.
Genotoxic effect was evaluated on the basis of micronucleus test (9). Metabolic 
capacity of the liver was assessed by determining the level of cytochrome P —  450 and 
the activity of selected monooxygenases: (1) 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD) 
dependent on cytochrome P —450/448 —  constitutively expressed as: CYP1A2, 
highly inducible by aryl hydrocarbons; CYP2B subfamily, highly inducible by 
phenobarbital class of compounds and CYP2B1 form by ethanol as well; 
CYP2E1, highly inducible by ethanol and a number of other small chemicals that are 
substrates for the enzyme; CYP3A subfamily, representing up to 60% of total P450 s, 
highly inducible by several xenobiotics; and all of the P —  450s are involved in drug 
metabolism and procarcinogens activation, and (2) 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase 
(EROD) dependent on cytochrome P —448 —  constitutively not expressed as 
CYP1A1 and constitutively expressed as CYP1A2, both highly inducible by 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, capable of activating procarcinogens (7). ECOD 
and EROD were chosen for the present study because these monooxygenases could 
undergo stimulation by ethanol owing to induction of CYP2E1, CYP1A1, CYP2B1 
and CYP3A1 (30).
Evaluation of the level of cytochrome P —450 and activities of microsomal mono­
oxygenases
Mice were sacrificied by decapitation and livers were excised and homogenized 
with 8 volumes of KC1 (150 mmol) buffered with Tris-HCl (10 mmol) pH 7.4 in 
a glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a teflon pestle to yield a 10% (w/v) 
homogenate. Microsomes were sedimented from 9 000 g postmitochondrial super­
natant by ultracentrifugation at 4°C at 105 000 g for 1  h 15 min in Beckman XL-70 
OPTIM A preparative ultracentrifuge, according to Dallner and Ernster (4). M icro­
somes, obtained from 7 ml of the 9 000 g postmitochondrial supernatants (¾ 0.85 g
370 T. Wrońska-Nofer et al.
of liver) were suspended by homogenization in 2.5 ml potassium phosphate buffer 
(0.1 mol) pH 7.4 and diluted directly before assay to a concentration 2 mg protein per 
ml of the suspension.
Protein in microsomes was determined with Folin phenol reagent by the 
method of Lowry et al. (14).
Cytochrome P —450 in the hepatic microsomes was determined according to 
Om ura and Sato (19). Carbon monoxide difference spectra of dithionite-reduced 
microsomes were recorded between 490 and 450 nm using Beckman ACTA CIII 
spectrophotometer. An extinction coefficient of 91 m m ol - 1 cm - 1 was used for 
cytochrome P —450 quantifying.
Activity of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD), was assayed according to 
Aitio (1).
Activity of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), was determined according 
to Pohl and Fouts (21).
Ethanol in blood at the time of sacrificing of animals (2:00 p.m.) was determined 
enzymatically with alcohol dehydrogenase and NAD according to Bernt and 
Gutm an (2).
Evaluation of genotoxicity
The micronucleus test was carried out on mice preinduced with ethanol and/or 
treated with single dose of Acid Green 16. Positive and negative reference controls 
received Mitomycin C or physiological saline, respectively. The bone marrow was 
sampled 30 h after the injections. The preparation of bone marrow and staining were 
carried out according to procedure described by Przybojewska et al. (23). The 
number of micronucleated cells in at least 1 0 0 0  polychromatic erythrocytes and the 
ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes were determined for each 
animal.
Statistical analysis
The results were analysed statistically according to the Student t-test.
RESULTS
General effect of exposure
The weight gain of mice was slightly lower in the ethanol treated group in 
comparison with those consuming control liquid diet, probably due to ineffective 
utilization of calories derived from ethanol: the failure of ethanol energy conser­
vation may be linked to increased microsomal oxidation of ethanol, a process which 
is not linked to ATP production. The mean daily ethanol intake amounted to 
21 g/kg of body weight. Alcohol in blood, determined at the time of sacrificing of 
mice (after 6 days of feeding of ethanol liquid diet) was almost at the same level and 
amounted to 0.77 and 0.59% for ethanol and ethanol +  Acid Green 16 groups, 
respectively (Table 1).

Effect of ethanol and/or Acid Green 16 on the microsomal monooxygenases
Ethanol treatm ent resulted in a significant increase in hepatic microsomal 
protein and cytochrome P —  450 content and associated monooxygenases activities. 
Cytochrome P  —450 content increased 3-fold after 6 days of ethanol treatment. 
There was no significant difference in microsomal hepatic cytochrome P —  450 levels 
between animals fed control liquid diet and those fed standard laboratory diet. It is 
worth noting that inductive potential of ethanol exceeds markedly that of phenobar­
bital (Table 2).

ECOD and EROD activities after 6 days of ethanol liquid diet feeding was 
elevated 8.4-fold and 5.7-fold, respectively, in comparison with controls. Adminis­
tration of Acid Green 16 to mice pretreated with ethanol liquid diet resulted in 
a slight reduction of inductive effect of ethanol itself. Acid Green 16 administered 
singly at dose 150 mg/g body wt affected neither the level of cytochrome P —450 nor 
the activities of examined enzymes ECOD and EROD (Table 2).
Effect of ethanol on genotoxic effect of Acid Green 16
Acid Green 16 caused a significant and dose related increase in the frequency of 
polychromatic erythrocytes with micronuclei in the bone marrow of mice (Table 3).

Genotoxicity of triarylmethane dye 373
Ethanol treatment had no effect on the spontaneous frequency of polychromatic 
erythrocytes with micronuclei. However, inductive effect of ethanol on the cyto­
chrome P —  450 system (Table 2) resulted in enhanced activation of Acid Green 16 to 
genotoxic form. The number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the 
bone marrow of mice fed ethanol liquid diet and singly treated with Acid Green 16 
was w 40% higher than in mice treated with Acid Green 16 only (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Many known genotoxic agents fall into the category of chemicals that need 
metabolic activation. Lack of metabolic activation has been one of the major 
limitations of studies in vitro.  Furthermore, the activation process in studies in vivo  
may facilitate a rapid screening of substances for their genotoxic potential. D ata 
from such a study would be of value for setting priorites for more definite testing of 
the metabolic pathway and genotoxic species of the compounds in question. The 
genotoxic potential of Acid Green 16 superimposed on ethanol preinduction may be 
the case.
In the present study a short-term model of alcoholization of mice, employing 
ethanol liquid diet to achieve induction of hepatic monooxygenases which metabol­
ize both, xenobiotics and ethanol, was applied successfully. It was aimed at 
elucidating whether a stimulatory effect of ethanol on the enzymes, owing to 
predominant induction of cytochrome P —4502E1, enhances the genotoxic effect of 
Acid Green 16, via metabolic activation in this system. The induction of microsomal 
monooxygenase by ethanol was first shown in rat by Rubin and Lieber (24). Since 
that time, many studies have confirmed the effect in rats (25,26,33), rabbits (17), mice 
(27), hamsters (10,15) and men (24). It was also indicated that the extent of the 
cytochrome P —450 enzymes induction is related to the exposure regimen, dosage, 
route and duration of ethanol administration, e.g. in drinking water (33,35), in liquid 
diet (27) or vapour inhalation (16).
The results of this study show that after 6 days of ethanol administration in 
liquid diet, the mouse hepatic cytochrome P —450 (CYP2E1) level increased by three 
times when compared with the control and metabolic capacity of the system, as 
expressed by ECOD and EROD, raised many more times (Table 2). As inferred from 
the data, both assayed enzymes, ECOD (preferentially) and EROD (to minor extent) 
responded to ethanol induction of CYP2E1. Any of the substrates tested, namely 
neither 7-ethoxycoumarin nor 7-ethoxyresorufin, was specific for CYP2E1. However, 
7-ethoxycoumarin was indicated in the study to be a satisfactory substrate of 
CYP2E1 to demonstrate the induction capacity of ethanol (and phenobarbital, as 
reference). The 7-ethoxyresorufin substrate, more specific for CYP1A subfamily, was 
also metabolized at higher rate in the system of CYP2E1. The above results may be 
related to cross-reactivity of CYP2E1 with reaction catalyzed by CYP2A1/2 and 
ethanol-stabilized cytochrome P —450s protein. A significant increase in hepatic 
cytochrome P —450 with concomitant increase of microsomal protein content in 
ethanol treated mice (Table 2) confirmed that the effect induced by ethanol on the 
microsomal monooxygenase system depends on substrate (ethanol) —  mediated 
cytochrome P —450 protein stabilization in 2E1 form (7,28,29). The ubiquitous 
nature of CYP2E1 substrates in the industrial workplaces and environment has 
marked human health implications. In the case of CYP2E1 induction owing to
374 T. Wrońska-Nofer et al.
ethanol abuse many industrial chemicals can be metabolized with a higher rate 
resulting in alteration of potential health hazard from combined exposure. The 
extent of induction of the CYP2E1 dependent monooxygenases by ethanol seems to 
be high enough to increase the toxic/genotoxic potential of some agents through the 
enhancement of metabolic activation: the increased frequency of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes provoked by Acid Green 16 in ethanol-preinduced mice 
carroborates this assumption (Table 4).
The results of this study suggest biotransformation of Acid Green 16 via 
CYP2El-dependent bioactivation as inferred from its increased genotoxicity in 
ethanol-preinduced mice. Enhancement of genotoxic effect of the dye by ethanol is 
closely related to stimulatory effect of ethanol on cytochrome P-4502El-dependent 
microsomal monooxygenases in the liver. Treatment of mice with ethanol, especially 
effective in a form of ethanol liquid diet, led to the induction of CYP2E1 enzymatic 
protein in the liver as manifested by a pronounced increase in the level of 
cytochrome P —  450, (CYP2E1), the content of microsomal protein and metabolic 
rate of associated enzymes, ECOD and EROD (Table 2). In a final analysis, an 
enhancement of frequency of polychromatic erythrocytes with micronuclei in the 
bone marrow of mice jointly exposed to Acid Green 16 dye and ethanol may be 
taken as an end point of genotoxic effect of the arylmethane dye (industrial hazard 
factor) presumably related to CYP2E1-dependent activation pathway induced by 
ethanol (environmental extra-factor).
