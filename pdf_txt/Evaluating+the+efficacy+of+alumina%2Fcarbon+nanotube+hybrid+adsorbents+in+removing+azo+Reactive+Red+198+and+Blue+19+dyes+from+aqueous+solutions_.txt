abstract
In the present study, the potential usage of iron-based magnetic aluminium oxide nanocompos-
ite (IMANC) as a novel magnetic nanoadsorbent, which was synthesized by solution combustion 
method using a stoichiometric amount of glycine (100%) as fuel type, was investigated for the 
Reactive Blue 19 (RB19) dye removal from aqueous solutions by adsorption process. The synthesized 
IMANC sample found to have small particle size and high surface area with the porous structure 
according to the results obtained from the characterization studies performed. The dye adsorption process onto IMANC sample was optimized by applying the response surface methodology. For 
optimization studies, the experimental set was planned using an experimental design programme, 
Design Expert 11.0 trial software. The effects of pH, temperature and nanoadsorbent amount were investigated for RB19 dye removal from aqueous solutions. A model equation was developed using 
the Box–Behnken methodology. Additionally, the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models were 
examined according to the data obtained from the adsorption experiments performed at optimum process conditions. Moreover, the removal efficiencies of the regenerated IMANC synthesized were 
determined for each adsorption–desorption cycle. Even after the tenth adsorption–desorption cycle, 
the removal efficiency of the regenerated IMANC was maintained at approximately 96% of the ini-tial efficiency which shows that the nanoadsorbent is extremely effective and reusable. Therefore, it 
was concluded that IMANC synthesized has great application potential in dye removal from aque-
ous solutions due to its desirable features such as high adsorption capacity, easy regeneration and adequate repeated uses.

1. Introduction
The dyestuffs and pigments are widely used in vari-
ous industries; textile, food, paint, paper, plastic, cosmetics, 
food, leather, drug, rubber and etc. The release of various 
quantities of synthetic dyes and/or dye by-products into the water from several industrial areas during coloring and washing steps leads to environmental pollution problems. The synthetic dyes and pigments are non-biodegradable and toxic due to their aromatic rings in their structures [1–12]. Moreover, synthetic dyes usually consist of various contam-inations including acids, bases, toxic compounds and color [13,14]. The release of synthetic dyes from various industries into water significantly threatens human health, animals, and 439 M. Pehlivan et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 191 (2020) 438–451
plants. Because, the synthetic dyes can cause some illness 
and disorders in reproductive systems, liver, brain, central 
nervous system and etc. [5,15,16].
Reactive Blue 19 (RB19) is an anionic dye and one of 
the most commonly used dyes in the industries of textile, carpet, plastic, cosmetic, food, leather, printing, paper, and 
etc. However, recent researches suggested that RB19 dye 
has mutagenic properties due to its electrophilic vinyl sul-
fone groups [17–19]. Moreover, the solubility of RB19 dye 
is high and its degree of fixation is low, which makes RB19 dye potential carcinogen and toxic. Therefore, it is important 
to provide a reliable and eco-friendly method for RB19 dye 
removal from wastewater [20,21].
There are several treatment techniques including chem-
ical, physical and biological for removing the dyes from wastewater; adsorption [22], coagulation and/or floccula-
tion [23], chemical oxidation [24], membrane separation 
[25], electrochemical degradation [26], microbial degrada-
tion [27], ozonation [28], ion-exchange [29] and etc. These 
methods apart from adsorption have several disadvantages like the utilization of synthetic chemicals, the formation of 
undesired products, being expensive and etc. On the other 
hand, the adsorption technique is a commonly preferred and 
more versatile technique among the other techniques used in wastewater treatment due to its simple operation, inex-pensiveness, eco-friendliness, pH tolerance, easier recov-
ery of adsorbent and high-quality of the treated effluents. 
Additionally, the adsorption process does not require huge 
investment and/or energy source which are undesirable facts for the treatment of wastewater [30–34].
The adsorption process of dyes is related to the prop-
erties of dyes and the surface chemistry of adsorbent used. 
Moreover, the process conditions of aqueous solution; tem-
perature, pH, adsorbent amount, initial dye concentration and etc., play the main role in the dye adsorption process effectiveness.
As reported in the study performed by Salleh et al. [31], 
the pH value of the solution affects the adsorption of anionic and cationic dyes differently. For cationic dye adsorption at high pH values, the positive charge at the solution interface decreases and the adsorbent surface charged negatively. 
Therefore, the cationic dye adsorption increases unlike 
anionic dye adsorption. Oppositely, for anionic dye adsorp-
tion at lower pH values, the positive charge on the solution interface increases and the adsorbent surface charged pos-itively. Thus, the anionic dye adsorption increases unlike 
cationic dye adsorption. Consequently, for cationic dye 
adsorption, high pH values are required, but for anionic dye 
adsorption, lower pH values are required [31].
In the literature, the various studies on RB19 dye (anionic 
dye) removal from aqueous solutions for wastewater treat-
ment were performed by using agricultural and industrial 
wastes, organic or inorganic based materials as adsorbents. 
For example; several adsorbents used for RB19 dye removal 
are as follows; modified and non-modified orange peel [18], lignocellulosic waste [35], nanostructured magnesium 
oxide particles [36], activated carbon [1], multi-walled and 
single-walled carbon nanotubes [37], chitosan-coated mag-
netic hydroxyapatite nanoparticles [2], jujube stems pow-
der [38], NiO nanoparticles [39], pomegranate seeds pow-der [5], Lemna minor [21], alumina/carbon nanotube [40], rice straw fly ash [41], multi-walled carbon nanotubes [42], 
L-arginine-functionalized Fe
3O4 nanoparticles [43], hydroxy-
apatite (HAp) nanopowders [44], wheat straw [13], peanut 
shell [45], Panus tigrinus [17], chitosan/SiO2/carbon nano-
tubes [46], modified silica gel [47], chitosan-based magnetic adsorbent [22], graphene oxide modified with polystyrene [48] and etc.
The magnetic nanocomposites indicate high saturation 
magnetization and high coercivity [49]. Therefore, several researchers have studied the synthesis of magnetic nano-composites and analyzed their properties [50–53]. The sep-aration process of iron based magnetic aluminium oxide 
nanocomposite (IMANC) from the liquid phase becomes 
easy by applying a magnetic field due to their magnetic 
properties [54,55]. In this sense, IMANC samples have gained increasing attention for their usage as effective nanoadsorbents and magnetic supports in the environmen-
tal and biotechnological areas [56–58]. In addition to high 
adsorption capacity, regeneration and efficient separation 
of magnetic nanocomposites are also important properties. Magnetic separation method has features such as high effi-ciency, low cost and eco-friendly compared to traditional centrifugation and filtration methods. Therefore, the numer -
ous studies were found on the usage of magnetic nanocom-posites as nanoadsorbents for the dye removal process, in the literature [2,22,59–61].
The experimental design is a structured and systematic 
approach for the determination of the effects of experimen-tal variables on the system [62,63]. Because, the conventional and classical methods are time consuming, and require lots of experiments for the determination of optimum conditions. The limitations of these methods can be eliminated by opti-mization of the process parameters using an experimental design like response surface methodology (RSM) [64,65]. RSM is the combination of mathematical and statistical meth-ods for modelling of engineering problems, and that can be used for evaluation of the significance of several factors in complex interactions [66,67]. So, optimization of adsorption process conditions by RSM will greatly help to progress of the industrial-scale dye removal treatment [31,68]. The most common and efficient technique used for RSM is called Box–Behnken design [69].
The novel magnetic nanoadsorbent samples, IMANC 
coded as SC-FA-G2 (solution combustion –Fe(NO
3)3/Al(NO3)3 
- glycine 100%), were synthesized by solution combustion method, which is an easy, quick and low-cost method for fabrication of nanosized materials, as reported in our previ-ous study [70]. After the evaluation of data obtained from the characterization studies, SC-FA-G2 found to have the high surface area with a porous structure and small particle size which are the desirable features for the adsorption process. In the present study, it was planned to examine the potential usage of SC-FA-G2 sample as a novel magnetic nanoadsor -
bent for RB19 dye removal from aqueous solutions for waste-water treatment.
For the adsorption process, the experimental set was 
planned using a Design Expert 11.0 trial software experi-mental design programme according to the RSM. The exper -
imental conditions were defined according to the reports demonstrated in the literature on the adsorption of RB19 dye. The pH range was chosen between 2 and 6, because of the M. Pehlivan et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 191 (2020) 438–451 440
higher uptake rate of RB19 dye in lower pH values [18,71,72]. 
Similarly, the temperature range was selected between 25°C and 45°C [72,73]. For the investigation of RB19 dye removal capacity of the nanoadsorbent used (SC-FA-G2) from aque-ous solutions, the set of experiments were conducted under the following process conditions such as pH values of 2, 4 and 6, temperature values of 25°C, 35°C and 45°C and nanoadsor -
bent amounts of 200, 400 and 600 mg/50 mL. According to data collected from adsorption experiments, the adsorption isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin) and the kinetic models (pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion) were examined at the optimum process conditions obtained. In addition, the effec-tiveness and reusability features of the regenerated novel magnetic nanoadsorbent (SC-FA-G2) were evaluated for each adsorption–desorption cycle.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO
3)3·9H2O) and 
iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) were pur -
chased from  Merck, Germany. Glycine (NH2CH2CO2H) was 
purchased from Alfa Aesar, United Kingdom. RB19 dye was 
supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. The chemical struc-ture of RB19 dye used is represented in Fig. 1. The chemicals were utilized without any further purification (Table 1). The specified amount of dye was added into distilled water for the preparation of the aqueous solution.
2.2. Studies on synthesis and characterization of magnetic 
nanoadsorbent
The novel magnetic nanoadsorbent sample, IMANC, 
coded as SC-FA-G2, was synthesized by solution combustion 
method as reported in our previous study [70]. The details of the characterization studies on the synthesized SC-FA-G2 by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared 
analysis, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric and differ -
ential thermal analysis, and surface area-porosity analyzer 
can be found in the previously reported study [70]. In this 
study [70], SC-FA-G2 (solution combustion – Fe(NO
3)3/
Al(NO3)3 – glycine 100%) found to have small particle size 
at approximately 60 nm and porous structure mostly in 
spherical particle shape. From Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis, the surface area was found as 19.69 m
2/g. The pore 
sizes of SC-FA-G2 were approached to 18.7 and 14.8 nm after 
adsorption and desorption analysis by the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method, respectively [70].
2.3. Studies on dye adsorption
The schematic view of the experimental procedure 
is represented in Fig. 2. The experimental set of RB19 dye 
adsorption was planned via Design Expert 11.0 trial soft-ware, an experimental design programme based on the RSM. 
The effects of parameters on adsorption of RB19 dye onto 
IMANC coded as SC-FA-G2 was investigated using a three-
level Box–Behnken design method. The factor levels were coded as –1 (low), 0 (central point) and 1 (high). According to the data from Box–Behnken Design, 17 experiments 
were resumed to optimize the process parameters such as 
pH, temperature and nanoadsorbent amount for RB19 dye 
removal efficiency of SC-FA-G2 used.
Adsorption experiments were performed by the addi-
tion of magnetic nanoadsorbent into Erlenmeyer flask con-
taining 50 mL of RB19 dye solution (100 ppm) at defined 
pH and temperature values. The effects of pH (2, 4, and 6), 
temperature (25°C, 35°C, and 45°C) and nanoadsorbent amount (4, 8, and 12 g/L) on the dye adsorption process 
were investigated. The initial pH of the dye solution was 
adjusted with the solutions of 1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH. 
The flasks were shaken in an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 
60 min. During the experiments, the samples were with-
drawn from the flasks at defined time intervals. Then, the 
dye molecules adsorbed onto magnetic nanoadsorbent 
were removed from the solution easily by using a commer -
cially available neodymium (NdFeB) magnet.
The optical densities of the samples were measured 
via a UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 592 nm wavelength 
for determination of remaining RB19 dye concentration. All experiments were run at least in duplicate, and the aver -
age of the measurements was taken. The reproducibility 
between the trials was within ±5%.
The dye adsorption capacities (q
e, mg/g) and dye removal 
rate percentage, RDye Removal (%), were calculated using Eqs. (1) 
and (2), respectively.

are C0 and Ce (mg/L), respectively. The volume of the dye 
solution is V (L), and m (g) is the amount of adsorbent used.
2.4. Studies on dye desorption capability and reusability of 
magnetic nanoadsorbent
Dye desorption capability and repeated uses of SC-FA-G2 
as a nanoadsorbent were investigated at optimum condi-
tions as performed successive adsorption–desorption cycles. The adsorption studies were performed by the addition of 400 mg nanoadsorbent into a 50 mL RB19 dye solution. 
Then, the solution was mixed at 100 rpm for 60 min of pro-
cessing time at a pH of 2 and a temperature of 25°C. After the adsorption process, SC-FA-G2 was separated from aqueous solution by a commercially available neodymium (NdFeB) magnet. Then, recovered SC-FA-G2 was transferred into 50 mL of NaOH solution (0.1 M) for desorption studies. After 
5 min of desorption time, the absorbance value of RB19 dye remained in the solution was measured via a UV-Vis spec-trophotometer. The same procedure was followed for each adsorption–desorption cycle experiment conducted. The adsorption and recovery steps were repeated after 10 cycles. 
4% loss of adsorption capacity (remaining 96%) was found 
even after 10 repeated adsorption–desorption cycles. The 
images of SC-FA-G2 before and after the RB19 dye adsorp-tion process were represented in Figs. 3a and b, respectively.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Box–Behnken design method analysis for dye adsorption data
Using the Box–Behnken design method, 17 experiments 
were performed for investigation of the effects of process parameters; pH (X 1), temperature (T : X2) and nanoadsor -
bent amount (AD: X 3), for 60 min of processing time. The 
coefficients of the response function for process parame-
ters were determined via Design Expert 11.0 trial software. The Box–Behnken design matrix and experimental responses for RB19 dye adsorption onto SC-FA-G2 were represented in Table 2.
The removal percentages of five experiments at the 
central point (at pH of 4, temperature of 35°C and nanoad-sorbent amount of 400 mg SC-FA-G2/50 mL) were found 
very close to each other and associated with minimization of experimental errors. The minimum dye removal percent-age was determined as 25 at the following conditions; pH of 6, 35°C, and 200 mg SC-FA-G2/50 mL. The maximum 
dye removal (100%) was determined at the following pro-cess conditions; (i) pH of 2, temperature of 25°C and 400 mg 
SC-FA-G2/50 mL; (ii) pH of 2, temperature of 35°C and 
600 mg SC-FA-G2/50 mL; and (iii) pH of 2, temperature of 
45°C and 400 mg SC-FA-G2/50 mL.
Considering the lower energy and nanoadsorbent 
amount requirements; the optimum process conditions for the achievement of 100% dye removal; pH, temperature and nanoadsorbent amount were chosen as 2, 25°C, and 400 mg/50 mL, respectively. After the evaluation of the exper -
imental data, the quadratic model, Eq. (3), was developed using the Box–Behnken design method. ANOVA analysis data for the quadratic model developed is represented in Table 3.
R
Dye Removal (%) =  63 – 21(pH:X1) + 5.38(T:X2) + 22.38(AD:X3) +

2 + 1.25(T:X2)2 
+ 3.75(AD:X3)2 (3)
According to the coefficients of process parameters of 
the response function developed [Eq. (3)], it was concluded that the temperature and nanoadsorbent amount have a 
positive influence on RB19 dye removal. The coefficients of 
determination R
2 and adjusted R2 of the model were obtained 
as 0.9783 and 0.9505, respectively. The difference between

predicted and experimental data was found as reasonably 
small, indicating the model adequacy to the response. A com-parison of the predicted values vs. actual ones of RB19 dye removal percentages is illustrated in Fig. 4.
The analysis of variance (ANOVA) for Eq. (3) devel-
oped was represented in Table 3. The significance of pro-cess variables was checked by F-value and P-value. As given 
in Table 3, the F -value of the Model (35.13) states that the 
model is significant. P-values less than 0.001 mean that 
the model terms are significant. The terms of X1, X2, X3, 
X1X3 and X 1X1 were significant, with very small P-values 
(P-values < 0.05). The lack of fit F-value of 2.84 indicates the significance of the model correlation between the variables and the adsorption of RB19 dye. The lack of fit F -value is not 
significant as P-value is higher than 0.05. Therefore, all these 
results indicated that the model developed was applicable for the present study [1,69,74].
3.2. Effect of process variables
Three-dimensional response surface plots were consti-
tuted with the Design Expert 11.0 trial software experimental 
design programme presenting the effects and their interac-
tions on the parameters of the RB19 dye adsorption process

(Figs. 5a–c). As can be seen from Figs. 5a and b, the decrease in 
pH resulted in the increase for RB19 dye removal percentage. From Figs. 5b and c, the removal percentage of RB19 dye increased with ascending nanoadsorbent amount arising 
from the presence of more surface area of the nanoadsorbent.
Additionally, F-values can be used for the determination 
of the significance of the terms or components in the model 
developed [74,75]. Table 3 shows that the parameters of pH and nanoadsorbent amount are the most significant ones on 
the dye removal process as they have high F-values while 
the temperature is a less significant parameter as it has lower 
F-value compared to others.
As reported in the literature [31], the pH of the solution 
controls the magnitude of electrostatic charges which are imparted by dye molecules. Then, this will cause electrical interactions between dye molecules and adsorbent [31,76]. Similarly, in the present study, pH has a dramatic effect on the adsorption process. Therefore, electrical interactions seem to play an important role on the adsorption process. Additionally, the adsorption process may also be affected by mechanical trapping of dye molecules onto the surface of the porous structure of nanoadsorbent used.
3.3. Effect of processing time on dye removal process
The effect of processing time on RB19 dye removal is 
represented in Fig. 6. According to the data represented in 
Fig. 6, RB19 dye removal percentages were achieved as 96.2, 96.7, 98.8, and 100 at the processing times of 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, respectively. Although 96.2% of dye was removed 
in the first 5 min of the processing time, no fluctuations 
were observed during 60 min of the processing time.
3.4. Adsorption isotherm models
The distribution of the dye molecules at equilibrium 
between liquid and solid phases can be determined using 
adsorption isotherm models. Moreover, adsorption isotherm is important for the evaluation of the adsorption capacity [31]. The experimental data of RB19 dye adsorption onto SC-FA-G2 were examined by three most common adsorp-tion isotherm models; namely Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin; which were illustrated at Eqs. (4)–(6), respectively.

where qe (mg/g) is adsorption capacity at equilibrium, 
Ce (mg/L) is concentration of adsorbate at equilibrium, 
qm (mg/g) is maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent, 
b (L/mg) is Langmuir adsorption constant related to adsorp-
tion energy, kf (mg1–1/nL1/ng–1) is Freundlich affinity coefficient, 
n is Freundlich exponential coefficient, R (8.314 J/mole K) is 
ideal gas constant, T (K) temperature, bT (J/mole) is Temkin 
constant related to adsorption temperature, and AT (L/g) 
Temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant.
The adsorption isotherm parameters, correlation coeffi-
cient (R2) and standard deviation (σ) values calculated from 
experimental data were represented in Table 4. According to the data obtained, the Langmuir isotherm model was found as the most suitable model with the higher value of correlation coefficient (R
2) and lower value of the standard 
deviation (σ) (Fig. 7) comparison to Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models examined, as stated in the studies for RB19 dye adsorption non-modified orange peel [18], lignocellu-losic waste [35], nanostructured magnesium oxide particles [36], jujube stems powder [38], Lemna minor [21], hydroxy-
apatite nanopowders [44], activated carbon [13], peanut shell [45], Panus tigrinus [17], chitosan/SiO
2/carbon nano-
tubes [46], modified silica gel [47], chitosan-based magnetic adsorbent [22] and etc. Langmuir isotherm model suggests that the RB19 dye adsorption onto SC-FA-G2 as novel mag-netic nanoadsorbent is monolayer in nature as also stated by Xu et al. [22]. Even though, Temkin isotherm model has a high correlation coefficient value that did not describe very well the data of RB19 dye adsorption onto SC-FA-G2 due to its high standard deviation value (σ = 0.8497). 
Similarly, the Freundlich isotherm model was not found as an appropriate model for defining the adsorption data of RB19 dye as its standard deviation value (σ = 0.1076) found 
higher than the value (σ = 0.0275) obtained for Langmuir 
isotherm model (Table 4).
Additionally, the essential characteristics of Langmuir 
isotherm can be distinguished in terms of dimensionless separation factor, R
L defined as [5,44,48,77]:

favorable (0 < RL < 1), unfavorable (RL > 1), linear (RL = 1) 
or irreversible (RL = 0) [5,44,48,77]. In the present study, for 
Langmuir isotherm, RL value was calculated as 0.024 which 
is between 0 and 1, suggesting that the RB19 dye adsorp-
tion process onto SC-FA-G2 magnetic nanoadsorbent was favorable.
Isotherm models can be used as a guide for investiga-
tion of the adsorption mechanism. In the study performed by Iqbal and Ashiq [78], Azizi et al. [48] and Vijayalakshmi et al. [79], it was reported that the adsorption data that fit the Langmuir isotherm model can be associated with the chemical adsorption. In the present study, the Langmuir iso-therm model was determined as the most appropriate model with a higher value of correlation coefficient (R
2 = 0.9956) 
and a lower value of standard deviation (σ = 0.0275) for the 
adsorption data of RB19 dye onto SC-FA-G2. This result sup-ports that the possible mechanism of the adsorption process may be the chemisorption.
On the other hand, it was also reported that the 
Freundlich parameter (1/n ) in Eq. (5) might give infor -
mation about the adsorption mechanism. As reported in the study performed by Dehvari et al. [5], the Freundlich parameter (1/n ) may be associated with the mechanism of 
the adsorption process. Additionally, if 1/n  value is smaller 
than 1, the adsorption process is controlled by chemisorp-tion. In the present study, the Freundlich parameter (1/n ) 
was calculated as 0.3041 less than 1, with the correlation coefficient of R
2 of 0.9768 and the standard deviation of 
σ of 0.1076. Although the Freundlich model is not the best fitted model among others examined, this result found here indicates that the possible mechanism of the adsorp-tion process of RB19 dye onto SC-FA-G2 may be associated with the chemisorption.
Temkin isotherm model may also be helpful for the 
prediction of the adsorption mechanism. In the study per -
formed by Ahmed et al. [18], it was reported that Temkin constant, b, is related with the heat of sorption (J/mole), and 
if b value is higher than 45 J/mole, the adsorption process 
can be chemical in nature. In the present study, the values of the regression coefficient and the standard deviation of the Temkin isotherm model were found as R
2 = 0.9982 
and σ = 0.8497. The heat of adsorption was calculated as 
284.03 J/mole which is higher than 45 J/mole. Although 
the Temkin model is not the best fitted model among others examined, this result found here suggesting that the mechanism of adsorption may be associated with the chemisorption.
3.5. Adsorption kinetic models
As the determination of the adsorption kinetic is highly 
important for planning and controlling of adsorption process 
[31], adsorption kinetic studies were performed for calcu-lation of the adsorption rate using adsorbate concentration at a specific time. For RB19 dye removal onto SC-FA-G2 by adsorption, the experimental data were evaluated by adsorp-tion kinetic models; pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second- order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models, which were illustrated at Eqs. (8)–(11), respectively.

where qe (mg/g) is adsorption capacity at equilibrium, 
qt (mg/g) is adsorption capacity at time t, k1 (1/min) is pseu-
do-first-order adsorption rate constant, kp2 (g/mg min) is 
pseudo-second-order adsorption rate constant, a (mg min/g) 
is initial adsorption rate, b (g/mg) is constant related to 
extent of surface coverage and activation energy, ki intrapar -
ticle diffusion rate constant (mg/g min2) and ci is a constant 
related to layer thickness (mg/g).
The adsorption kinetic parameters, the values of cor -
relation coefficient (R2) and standard deviation (σ) are rep-
resented in Table 5. According to the data obtained, the pseudo- second-order kinetic model was determined as the 
most agreeable kinetic model with the high value of cor -
relation coefficient (R
2) and low value of the standard devi-
ation (σ) among other models examined (Fig. 8) (Table 5) as stated in the studies for RB19 dye adsorption onto modified and non-modified orange peel [18], lignocellulosic waste [35], jujube stems powder [38], NiO nanoparticles [39], pome granate seeds powder [5], Lemna minor [21], alumina/

nanopowders [44], wheat straw [13], peanut shell [45], 
Panus tigrinus [17], chitosan/SiO2/carbon nanotubes [46], chi-
tosan-based magnetic adsorbent [22], and etc.
As reported in the literature [5,22,31,80,81], pseudo-  
second-order kinetic may be associated with the chemically rate-controlling adsorption which called chemisorption. In the present study, pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found as the most appropriate model with a higher value of correlation coefficient (R
2 = 0.9999) and a lower value 
of standard deviation (σ = 0.0045) for the evaluation of the 
adsorption data of RB19 dye onto SC-FA-G2. Therefore, the adsorption may be associated with the chemisorption because of the kinetic data following the pseudo-second-  
order kinetic.
3.6. Activation energy calculation by Arrhenius relationship
Arrhenius equation can be used for the prediction of 
adsorption mechanism as stated in the studies performed 
by Ciobanu et al. [44], Mahmoud [82], Unuabonah et al. [83]. The linear form of the Arrhenius equation is expressed as:
lnkAE
RTpa
2=−

 ln  (12)
where Ea represents the activation energy of the adsorption 
process, k represents the kinetic rate constant of the adsorp-
tion process, A represents the temperature-independent 
factor in (g/mg min), the universal gas constant R is 8.314 J/
mole K and T is temperature in Kelvin. The value of acti-
vation energy (Ea) can be calculated from the plot of lnk vs. 
1/T graph which was obtained for the best fitting kinetic

model. The magnitude of Ea can be used for the prediction 
of the adsorption mechanism. If the activation energy is 
less than 40 kJ/mole, the possible mechanism of the adsorp-tion process could be physical in nature. Oppositely, higher activation energies are needed for the chemical adsorption process (40–800 kJ/mole) [44,82,83]. In the present study, 
the activation energy value (E
a) was determined by using 
kp2 values obtained from the pseudo-second-order kinetic 
that was found the best fitted model to the adsorption data (Fig. 9). E
a value was calculated as 54.443 kJ/mole with the 
correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9989 and the standard devia-
tion of σ = 0.0447. As the value of Ea calculated is higher than 
40 kJ/mole, the rate-limiting step in the RB19 dye adsorp-
tion onto the SC-FA-G2 process may be associated with the chemically controlled mechanism.3.7. Recovery efficiency of magnetic nanoadsorbent
The adsorption performance and the regeneration of 
adsorbents are the important parameters in practical appli-cations. Especially, adequate repeated uses are the most sig-nificant parameter for studying from the economic point of view [22,35]. In the present study, 0.1 mole/L NaOH solution 
was used to recover RB19 dye onto novel magnetic nanoad-sorbent, SC-FA-G2. As the pH of the solution increases, the number of negatively charged sites increases, which aids the desorption of RB19 dye [84].
The recovery efficiency values of the regenerated 
SC-FA-G2 obtained for each adsorption–desorption cycle are represented in Fig. 10. As can be seen from this figure, RB19 dye removal efficiencies were calculated as 100% and 96% in the first and tenth adsorption–desorption cycles, respectively. This result refers that the regenerated nanoad-sorbent still has a high recovery efficiency even after the tenth adsorption–desorption cycle. Then, it was concluded that the novel magnetic nanoadsorbent, SC-FA-G2, could be easily regenerated after its separation from the solution by using a magnet, and that can be reused again and again as an efficient nanoadsorbent.
In the literature, several researchers studied RB19 dye 
adsorption from aqueous solutions onto various adsor -
bent types such as some agricultural and industrial wastes, organic or inorganic based materials, and etc. The findings obtained from these studies and the present study are sum-marized in Table 6.
4. Conclusions

textile industry. The main findings obtained from the pres-
ent study on the RB19 dye adsorption onto SC-FA-G2 were summarized as follows:
• The experimental set of RB19 dye removal was planned 
using a Design Expert 11.0 trial software experimen-tal design programme according to RSM. The maxi-mum RB19 dye removal (100%) was observed under the process conditions as follows; (i) pH of 2, 25°C, and 400 mg SC-FA-G2/50 mL; (ii) pH of 2, 35°C, and 600 mg 
SC-FA-G2/50 mL; and (iii) pH of 2, 45°C, and 400 mg 
SC-FA-G2/50 mL for 60 min of processing time.
• The quadratic model was developed using the Box–Behnken design method to explain the relationship between the process parameters chosen and the process response. The most effective parameters on RB19 dye removal were found as pH and nanoadsorbent amount. But, the effect of temperature was found less significant on RB19 dye removal compared to other parameters investigated.
• After evaluation of the data obtained from dye adsorption studies, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was found as the most appropriate model with a higher value of correlation coefficient (R
2 = 0.9956) and lower value of 
standard deviation (σ = 0.0275). The maximum adsorp-
tion capacity value (qm) was calculated as 55.25 mg/g. 
The separation factor, RL (0.024), for Langmuir isotherm 
showed that SC-FA-G2 was favorable for the RB19 dye adsorption.
• After evaluation of the data obtained from the kinetic studies, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found as the most appropriate model with a higher value of correlation coefficient (R
2 = 0.9999) and a lower value 
of standard deviation (σ = 0.0045).
• Arrhenius equation was used for calculation of the acti-vation energy for the dye adsorption by using pseudo- second-order rate constants and found as 54.443 kJ/mole. 
The activation energy (E
a) obtained higher than 40 kJ/
mole indicated that the adsorption process is chemical sorption.
• The parameters obtained from the isotherm, kinetic and Arrhenius models suggested that the chemisorption is the possible mechanism of the dye molecules adsorption process onto SC-FA-G2.
• The maximum dye recovery values were obtained at dra-matically shorter processing times at the optimum pro-cess conditions. For example, the maximum dye removal percentages at the temperature values of 25°C, 35°C, and 45°C were found as 96.5%, 100%, and 97.7% for 4, 2, and 30 min of processing time at the nanoadsorbent amounts 
of 8, 12, and 8 g/L, respectively.
• The recovery efficiency of the regenerated SC-FA-G2 was found as 96% even after the tenth adsorption–desorption cycle.Finally, the findings refer that SC-FA-G2 has remarkable 
features such as high adsorption capacity, easy regeneration and adequate repeated uses for removal of RB19 dye. Data showed that SC-FA-G2 could be utilized efficiently as a novel magnetic nanoadsorbent for the removal of anionic dyes from aqueous solutions. The extremely effective and reusable features of the novel magnetic nanoadsorbent give valuable information to the researchers who work on the environmen-tal sciences and to the industrial companies for eliminating this dye from wastewaters. For further studies, the potential usage of SC-FA-G2 as a promising alternative nanoadsorbent could be evaluated for the removal of various materials such as other textile or non-textile dyes, pesticides, heavy metals or other environmental pollutants from wastewater.
