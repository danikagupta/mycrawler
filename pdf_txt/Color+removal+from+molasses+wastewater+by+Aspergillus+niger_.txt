Abstract :  Molasses wastewater is waste from alcohol beverage 
industry which is huge industry. Its properties are high pollution. 
If released to environments without treatm ent, it can cause a lot of 
environmental problems. So, there are varieties methods for 
molasses wastewater treatment which highly effective in reducing 
the COD and BOD levels of the residue to the level that does not 
pose any problem to the environment. Ho wever, molasses 
wastewater contains difficult to remove melanoidin substance 
which causes dark colors. So the treated water is still dark. If 
discharged treated water to natural water sources, the water will 
be darker. The use of microorganisms in wastewat er treatment is a 
costly method and is relatively safe, even take a long time. This 
research is to study the optimum conditions for microorganism 
usage to remove dark color from wastewater by biological 
methods. Three  yeasts, Citeromyces siamensis, Issatch enkia 
orientalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were select ed for this 
study. Conduct ed the experiment by adding 1 -3 % of glucose, 
sucrose, lactose, yeast extract, peptone and urea in synthetic 
molasses wastewater to find the appropriate ratio  that will 
promote molasses wastewater color reduction of those yeast 
species . Cultured at 30 degrees Celsius for 7 days and measure 
color intensity with spectrophotometer at wavelength 660 nm .   It 
is found that the addition of 1 percent glucose resulted in the best 
color loss by all three yeasts compared to the addition of sucrose 
and lactose. It is also found that the addition of 1 percent peptone 
gave the best color removal efficiency by Citeromyces siamensis 
and Issatchenkia orientalis compared to the addition of pe ptone 
and urea. While Saccharomyces cerevisiae is effective in reducing 
the color of molasses wastewater when adding yeast extract 1 
percent.

I. INTRODUCTION  
    Molasses is one of the raw materials in alcohol production. 
Wastewater from the production of alcohol using molasses 
has many substances which cause pollution to environments 
and one is its dark brown to black color. The dark color of 
wastewater resulted from melanoidin which formed by the 
combination of sugar and amino acids at high temperatures 
through a browning reaction or a maillard reaction. It can 
make more dirty and darker to water source. This problem is 
solved in a variety ways including the use of microorganisms 
to remove the color but it is difficult because melanoidin is 
hard-biodegradable substance.   
    Microorganisms that have been studied include both 
bacteria and fungi  [1]. Miranda et al. [2] studied the color

 removal of molasses wastewater using Aspergillus niger . It 
was foun d that 69 % of the residue color was removed and    
75 % COD was reduced. Benito et al. [3] studied the color 
removal of molasses wastewater by using Trametes 
versicolor. It was found that 82% of the  residue color was 
removed and 77 % COD was reduced. Jimi nez et al. [4] 
studied the method of wastewater treatment by using aerobic 
and anaerobic system that uses 4 strains of fungus. 
Sirianuntapiboon et al. [5] [6]selected 205 strains of yeast 
from Thailand fruit samples and found some strain had the 
highest co lor removal capacity of 68.91 % at 30oC. 
Sirianuntapiboon studied 170 species of acetogenic bacteria 
and found that species which able to remove maximum color 
of 76.4 ± 3.2 % at 30oC. Raghukuma et al. [7] [8] studied the 
melanoidin removal by whitewash fun gi, Flavadon flavus . By 
10 % cell immobilization with polyurethane foam, Flavadon 
flavus  was able to remove 60 -70 % of color.  According to the 
previous  research, it indicates that there are many 
microorganisms that have the ability to degrade substances  
which cause wastewater color . Citeromyces siamensis  and 
Issactchenkia  orientalis  are yeast which can found in 
environment of Thailand . Citeromyces siamensis  is a 
halotolerant yeast , while Issactchenkia orientalis  has been 
studied for the use of fungicide in plant  [9]. Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae  is used to produce many kinds  of beverages and 
food. These yeasts  can grow in the presence of sugar , 
including molasses. Therefore , it is possible to culture  these 
yeasts  to eliminate contaminants in waste water . This st udy 
was conducted determining the suitable conditions of medium  
in testing the efficiency of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , another 
familiar yeast species, for molasses wastewater decolorization 
compare with Citeromyces siamensis , Issatchenkia orientalis . 
This is a more effective treatment of using microorganisms in 
water pollution removal.  
II. PROCEDURE   
 Study on the optimum conditions for the reduction of 
molasses wastewater by comparing the appropriate carbon 
sources and nitrogen sources . 
A. Appropriate carbon sour ces 
Prepare yeast starter by Inoculate yeast to MYGP broth  
which add synthetic molasses wastewater 30 ml. Incubate at 
30 ° C for 24 hours. Then measured the absorbance with a 
spectrophotometer at wavelength 660 nm. The desired value 
is 0.5.  [10]   
Add 1.5 ml (5%) of th e yeast solution to 30 ml of synthetic 
molasses wastewater which has 1%, 2% and 3% of sucrose, 
lactose and glucose. Incubate at room temperature for 1 -7 day 
in 200 rpm shaker  [11]. At the end of each period, picked 
sample. Then analyzed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 20 
min.  Kept supernatant. Diluted 1 ml. of supernatant with 0.1 
M acetate buffer. Measured the absorbance by 
spectrophotometer at 475 nm.

IV. CONCLUSION  
    Based on experimental results, it was it was found that all 3 
types of yeasts could  reduce the color of wastewater . The 
results also  show n that adding glucose culminate on the 
reduction of molasses wastewater color. The ratio that gives 
the best results was glucose 1%. In the same way, 1% of 
peptone gave the best effective in reducing the color of 
molasses wastewater for Citeromyces siamens is and 
Issatchenkia orientalis  while 1% yeast extract effected in 
reducing the color of molasses wastewater for Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae . From the results, the addition of  little amount of  
glucose , peptone  and yeast extract improves the efficiency of 
color  remove  of Citeromyces siamensis , Issatchenkia 
orientalis  and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The addition of 
those substances in large quantities does not help to achieve 
higher efficiency than filling small quantities. Although the 
color still remains, it decr eases the intensity.  This finding may 
be apply for industrial waste water treatment. Since 
contaminated substances are difficult to decompose, as 
mentioned above, the treatment for clean water may require 
other factors to help.  Finding other  conditions is that should 
be studied further.
