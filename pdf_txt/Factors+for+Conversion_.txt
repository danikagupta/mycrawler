Conversion Factor s 
 
Conversion factors are ratios of one object to another object.  A ratio is  a way of comparing 
two quantities.  The quantities can be co mpared in three different ways:  a to b , a:b, or a/b.  
At the local grocery store, a case of soda co ntains 24 cans.  We can express  the ratio in 
three for ms: 
 
 (a to b)  24 cans of soda to each case of soda  
 (a:b)      24 cans of soda: 1 case of soda  
 (a/b)      24 cans of soda/1 case of soda 
 
 
This chapt er uses conversion factors frequently to solve problems.  Conversion factors are 
ratios writte n in the fra ction form ( a/b).  In this chapter, ther e are three major conversion 
factors we will learn to use: 
 
A universal conversion factor: 
1 mole of chemical contains 6.02 x 1023 molecules (or atoms) 
 
A molar mass conversion factor:  
1 mole of chemical weighs t he molar mass of the chemical 
 
A chemical formula conversion factor: 
1 mole of chemical contains some number of moles of atoms 
 
 
 
If the chemical in the three conversion factors was CuCl 2, then the three conversion factors 
would be: 
 
1 mole of CuCl 2 contains 6.02 x 1023 molecules of CuCl 2 
 
1 mole of CuCl 2 weighs 134.6 grams CuCl 2 (the molar mass) 
 
1 mole of CuCl 2 contains 2 moles of chlorine atoms 
 
 
 
 1The most common way that chemists represent ratios is in a fracti on form.  T he three 
conversion factors would look li ke this in the fraction for m: 
 
1 mole CuCl 2   1 mole CuCl 2   1 mole CuCl 2    
6.02 x 1023 molecule CuCl 2 134.6 g CuCl 2  2 mole Cl atoms 
      
   
 
Each of these conversion fa ctors can be written in the inverse form .  The first r atio we 
examined involved cans of soda.  We expressed t hat ratio as 24 cans of soda in 1 case of 
soda.  The inverse form of this ratio is 1 case of soda contains 24 cans of soda.  The key  
idea here is that either the origin al rat io or its inverse form is t rue.  It is true that one 
case of soda contains 24 cans and it is true t hat there are 24 cans of soda in one case. 
 
Conversion factors in chemistry can be writt en as shown above or in the inverse form.  
Regardless  of which form is used, the compar ison the conversion factor makes is true.  
For example, one mole of CuCl 2 contains 6.02 x 1023 molecules of CuCl 2 and there are 
6.02 x 1023 molecules of CuCl 2 in every one mole of CuCl 2. 
 
 
Here are the three major conver sion factors from this ch apter writte n in the inverse form : 
 
6.02 x 1023 molecule CuCl 2 134.6 g CuCl 2  2 mole Cl atoms   
1 mole CuCl 2    1 mole CuCl 2   1 mole CuCl 2    
 
    
 
The obvious question at this point is:  Which form of the conversion factor should you use 
in a problem?   You use the form that allow s the units to cancel.   Units cancel when  the 
unit that appears on the top also  appears on the bottom of a fr action somewhere in the 
solution.  This style of problem-solving, wher e you arrange the conversion factors so that 
the units cancel, is called unit analysis.

Conversio n Factor Example 1 
 
Which is the correct solution for the question: How many cases of soda can be made from 
1200 cans of soda? 
 
1200 cans of soda  x   24 cans of soda  =  28800 cans of soda2/case of soda 
    1 case of soda 
 
1200 cans of soda  x   1 case of soda     =  50 cases of soda 
    24 cans of soda 
 
Solution: 
 
In which solution do the units cancel?  In  the second solution, the unit “cans of 
soda” cancels.  The correct solution will us e conversion factors in a way that units 
will cancel.  Blue lines are dr awn through unit s that cancel. 
 
 
Conversio n Factor Example 2 
 
2.5 moles of CuCl 2 contain how many molecules of CuCl 2? 
 
 
Solutio n 
 
This question uses the universal conversion fa ctor of moles to molecules.  Set up 
the solution so that the units cancel. Blue lines are drawn through units that cancel. 
 
2.5 moles of CuCl 2  x  6.02 x 1023 molecule s CuCl 2  =  1.5 x 1024 molecules CuCl 2 
    1 mole CuCl 2 
 
 
Conversio n Factor Example 3 
 
The formula for sugar is C 6H12O6.  How many moles of sugar  are present when 20.0 moles 
of oxygen are present? 
 
Solutio n 
 
This question requires  the chemical formula c onversion factor in the solution.   You 
don’t need to concern yourself with whether the conversion fa ctor is inverted or not.  
Just make sure that the units cancel. Blue lines are drawn through units that cancel. 
 
20.0 moles of oxygen  x 1 mole C 6H12O6   =  3 .33 moles C 6H12O6 
    6 moles oxygen

Hints for using conversion factors: 
 
How  do y ou know  what quantity  to st art with when solving problems? 
 
Start with the quantity given in the problem and not with the conv ersion factor.  In general, 
the first quantity in your unit analysis will not hav e a denominator.  In t he last example, we 
started with the number of moles of oxygen:  
 
20.0 moles of oxygen  x 1 mole C 6H12O6   =  3 .33 moles C 6H12O6 
    6 moles oxygen 
 
Notice that the first quantity is a whole number and not a frac tion.  If you start with the 
conversion factor, it is much har der to decide whether to use the original or inverse form of 
the conversion factor.   
 
 
 
Should I enter all of the numerator numbers  into the calculator before I enter the 
denominator numbers, or should I enter each conversion factor into the c alculator 
before I move on to the next conversion factor? 
 
Either style of entering the numeri cal quantities will work.  You should make a decision to 
always use one style of entering numbers into a calculat or.  This helps you avoid skipping 
a number when you are ca lculating an answer. 
 
In the example calculation below, you could ent er the numbers in ei ther of these orders 
and obtain the same answer. 
 
16  x 2.54  x   50 =  75.2 
              3         9 
 
Enter the numbers into your calculator as: 
 
16  x  2.54  ÷ 3  x  50  ÷ 9  = 
 
or 
 
16 x 2.54  x  50  ÷ 3  ÷ 9  = 
 
You don’t need to press the ENTER key after each mathematical.  
 4Fracti ons, Decimals and Percents 
 
 
Fractions, decimals, and percent ages are all related to each other.  Each is used to 
indicate some part of a whole quantity.  Fo r example, ¾, 0.75, and 75% a re all used to 
express  a quantity r epresenting three parts out of four.  The fraction represents the 
number of parts of the whol e (3 parts of the whole, which is divided into 4  equal s ized 
parts). 
 
The decim al represents the part of  one whole (0.75 of the whole). 
 
 
The percentage represents the nu mber of parts of a whole that has been divided into 10 0 
parts (75 parts of the whole  which has been divided into 100 equal parts).  
 
 
 Divide pie up into  
100 segments  
 
 
 
The fraction, 3/4, is converted to a decimal by  dividing the numerator (the number on top of 
the fraction) by the denominat or (the number on bottom of the fracti on).  Three divided by 
four is 0.75.  
 
The decim al is converted to the percentage by moving the decim al point two places to the 
right. This is equivalent to multiplying the dec imal by 100% in order to convert it to the 
percentage.  In this conv ersion, 0.75 becomes 75% 
 
To convert a percent to a decimal, we move t he decimal point two places to the left.  The 
decimal point in 75% is understood to be afte r the five i n the percentage.  In this 
conversion,  75% becomes 0.75.  
 
 
 
 5 
In this chapter, we use percentages more often than decimals or fractions.  The term 
percent  means “per cent” or “per  100.”  When we say that 10%  of people pref er Brand A, 
we mean that 10 people out of 100 people prefer Brand A.  When someone has 71% of 
the votes in an election, it means that 71 peopl e out of 100 people voted for that person.  A 
chemist might say that a substance is 64% nitrogen.  The chemist means that 64 atoms 
out of every 100 atoms are nitrogen.  
 
A percentage is another conversi on factor.  It can be writt en as a fraction and used in 
problem-solving (also called unit analys is).  Here are the examples  of percentages we 
used abov e written as conversion factors. 
 
10 people prefer Brand A     
100 people expressed an opinion   
 
71 people voted for candidate  
100 people voted 
 
64 atoms of nitrogen  
100 atoms present 
 
 
The secret to using percentages correct ly is to w rite the units correctl y.  It is very  
important that the units for t he “per 100” part indicate what substance is being measured or 
counted.  The numerator or  top of the fraction should clearl y indicat e what small portion of 
the whole quantity is being meas ured or counted.  In other words, a percentage should be 
written as:  
 
  The Part 
  The Whole 
 
 
Percentag e Example 1: 
 
How would you present each percentage as a fraction? 
 
47% of applicants wer e women 
15% of atoms were sulfur 
 
Solutio n 
 
47 female applicants (the Part)  
100 total applic ants (the Whole) 
 
15 atoms sulfur (the P art) 
100 atoms total (the Whole) 
 6Sometimes we are asked to calculate percentages  from actual measurem ents. In this type 
of problem, a percent i s not given in the problem. 
 
 
Percentag e Example 2: 
 
What percent of people in the class are women if 30 of the 50 students are female? 
 
Solution: 
 
Remember to divide the part by the whole.  What is the “whole” class number?  50.  
We divide the “part” (w hich is 30 female st udents) by the “whole” (which is 50  male 
and female students).  Then,  we multiply by 100 to create the percentage. 
 
30 women   x 100 =  60% 
50 students 
 
 
Chemists frequently us e percentages in calc ulations.  Remember, i t is important that you 
include unit s in your calculations to avoid mistakes. 
 
 
Percentag e Example 3: 
 
A total of 476 people were surveyed.  When a sked to choose the best tasting pizza, 34.2% 
of them chose Brand B.  How many people selected Brand B as the tastiest pizza? 
 
Solution: 
 
First, convert the percentage into a conv ersion factor.  Re member that the 
denominat or is alway s 100 (from the “per cent” part of the question). 
 
The conversion factor we  would write would be: 
 
34.2 of people selected Brand B  
100 people surveyed 
 
The total number of people we surveyed wa s MORE than 100.  It was 476.  How do 
we include this information in our  calculations? 
 
476 people surveyed  x   34.2 of people selected Brand B     
    100 people surveyed 
      
=  163 people selected Brand B 
 
 
 7Notice how the units cancel!  We can check t he answer to see if it is reasonable.  If 476 
people were surveyed, is it reasonable that  less than 476 chose Brand B?  Yes.  The 
percentage of people selecting Brand B was less than 50%.  Is 163 less than half of 476?  
Yes. 
 
 
Percentag e Example 4: 
  
If 54% of the mass of a mixtur e of iron and copper is iron, how much iron is there in a 
sample that has a mass of 25 grams? 
 
Solution: 
 
What is the conversion factor we  would write for the percentage?   
 
54 grams of iron  
100 grams mixture 
 
How did we choose the units “grams?”  The unit in which the measurement was 
done was given in the problem.  Now, let’ s use the conversion factor that we 
obtained from the percentage in the solution. 
 
25 grams mixture  x   54 g iron    =  14 grams iron 
    100 gram mixture 
 
Again, check to see if the answer is r easonable.  If about half of the mixture was 
iron and the mixture weighed 25 grams, we would expect  an answer of about 12.5 
grams.  Our estimate of the answe r agrees with the calculated ans wer. 
 
 
Percentag e Example 5: 
 
If a mixture of iron and copper was 54% iron, how much of the mixture would y ou need to 
use to have 200. grams of iron (plus the copper impurity in the mi xture)? 
 
Solution: 
 
This question uses the same conversion fact or as the previous example.  But how 
should you arrange the conversion fa ctor so that the units cancel? 
 
200. grams iron  x  100 grams mi xture   =   370 g mixture 
            54 grams iron 
 
Notice that we used the inverse form of the percentage.  We know to do this so that 
the units cancel.  If you set up the problem  so that the units cancel, you will be on 
the right track to get the correct answer!

Hints for using percentages: 
 
What units  do y ou choose w hen turning the percentage into a conversion factor? 
 
Look at the question to see what unit of meas urement is being used or what substance 
was being counted.  If the question describes  centimeters of meta l tubing, then both 
numerator and the denominat or will be in c entimeters.  If the question involv ed milliliter s of 
solution, then both the numerat or and the denominator will be in millilit ers.  Add other 
words to th e units to h elp you dist inguish “The Part” from “The Whole.”
