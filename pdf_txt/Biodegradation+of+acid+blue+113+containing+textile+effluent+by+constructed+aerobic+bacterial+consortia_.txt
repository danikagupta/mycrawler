Aesthetically, beautiful colours originating from dyes
and dyestuffs used in textile industries pose danger to theenvironment in long run as they are highly reactive and aremostly comprised of azo dyes. Azo dyes have been usedincreasingly in industries because of their ease and costeffectiveness in synthesis as compared to natural dyes.During dyeing processes about 10–90% of dye stuff do notbind to the fibres and therefore, is released into the wastewater treatment system or the environment (Zollinger 1991;Abdullah, , 2000). They are stable in acidic and alkalineconditions and are resistant to temperature and light. Most ofazo dyes are toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic (Pinheiro
, 2004). Their structural complexity (–N N–) makes
them poorly degradable, with potential for persistence andaccumulation of high-levels of dye in the environment. Thisdemands consistent efforts to develop an effective method forelimination of these dyes.et al.
et
al. ≡Treatment of such dye containing effluent includes
various physical and chemical treatment processes includingadsorption, concentration, chemical transformation, but withtime, potential hazards and disadvantages of these methodswere noted as formation of toxic sludge and formation ofeven more toxic metabolites. Alternatively, approach isshifting towards the use of conventional biological processesthat present eco-friendly and cost competitive alternatives inthe treatment of dyes. degradation of effluent is moreconvincing as it involves isolation of microorganisms fromeffluent and using the same for treatment of the effluent(Olukanni et al., 2006; Puvaneswari , 2006; Vijaykumar
, 2007).
On the other hand, presence of azo, nitro and sulfo
groups make dyes more resistant to microbial degradation andtheir residues accumulate in nature (Joe , 2008). Yet, therehave been numerous attempts to develop biological processesfor treatment of textile effluents using bacteria, fungi andenzymes (McMullan , 2001; Wesenberg , 2003).In situ

Abstract
Key wordsEnvironmental technologists working in the field of bioremediation face a great challenge in
treating dye containing textile effluent as effluent contains diverse groups of dyes, which a singlemicroorganism cannot handle. In the present study, aerobic bacterial consortium CN-1 containing5 different bacterial strains with the ability to degrade 3 different azo dyes were checked for itsability to degrade the same 3 dyes mixed together. The consortium removed 91.5% of these dyeswhen mixed in the ratio of 65:65:20 (Acid Blue 113, Mordant Black 17and Acid Black 24).Plackett Burman screening design indicated the importance of low concentration of dye and lowconcentration of glucose for maximum degradation of dyes. The consortium began to degrade themixed dye when they were in their mid lag phase, and the rate of degradation reached a maximumof 6.6 mg h after 4 hr of incubation which started to decrease gradually to 4.4 mg h by 16 hr afterwhich the decrease in the rate of degradation was found to be quite slow. Degradation was found tofollow the first order of kinetics with k value of 0.085 hr and R being 0.982. Salicylic acid and 2-naphthol were identified as intermediate compounds from GC-MS analysis.

Journal of Environmental Biology , May 2016Dye degradation is a complex process that involves
multiple steps. Even though a number of bacteria can bringabout dye degradation efficiently yet, each one is specific fora particular group of dyes. But for the treatment of dyecontaining effluent they cannot be depended as the effluentwill contain different groups of dyes. Under such conditionmicrobial consortia with organisms having differentspecificities can perform the treatment of dye containingeffluent more efficiently which is difficult or even impossiblefor individual strains or species (Tony 2007; Chan
2011).
In previous studies, bacterial consortium (using
bacteria isolated from textile effluent and soil near tanneryeffluent) capable of removing Acid Blue 113 (Valli Nachiyar
2012), Mordant Black 17 (Karunya 2014 a) and
Acid Black 24 (Anuradha 2014) individually in mineralsalt medium, as well as, in effluent has been reported. In thepresent study, however microbial consortium was checkedfor its efficiency to degrade mixture of these dyes mixed indifferent concentrations.
Effluent samples were collected
from Suntex processing mills, Gummidipoondi; Professionalfabrics, Tirupur and Kafer Textile mills, Tirupur. Numerouscolonies were obtained through serial dilution method.
: Acid blue 113 (AB113) [CI
No.26360], Acid black 24 (ABK24) [CI No.26370] dyeswere obtained from Saujanya Dye Chemicals, Ahmedabad,(Gujarat, India) while Mordant black 17 (MB17) [CINo.15705] was obtained from Dynasty Chemicals (Ningbo)Co., Ltd., China.
Bacteria
present in effluent were isolated by serial dilution method andtheir dye degrading ability was checked by pour plate methodon nutrient agar containing AB 113, AB 24 and MB 17separately. All the bacterial cultures were maintained onnutrient agar slants and were used for biodegradation studiesafter preculturing in nutrient broth for 12 hrs. The bacterialcells were cultivated in nutrient broth for 24 hr and cells aftercentrifugation were resuspended in 20% glycerol and storedat –20 ºC as stock cultures. Purity of glycerol stocks werechecked on nutrient agar plates before sub culturing onnutrient agar slants for inoculum preparation. Organismswere identified using 16S rRNA analysis (Karunya2014 a).
For degradation studies, mineral salt
medium having following composition was used (g l ) 1.73K HPO , 0.68 KH PO , 0.1 MgSO .7H O, 0.1 NaCl, 0.03FeSO 1.0 NH NO 0.02 CaCl .2H O and 5.00 glucose.et al., et

The consortium was developed
aseptically by transferring 2% inoculum containingapproximately 2 x 10 cells per ml of 24 hr grown culture ofeach individual strains (10 isolates +
CLRI BL22 obtained from CLRI) in 15 different
combinations in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mlof medium and 100 mg l dye solution. Individual strainswere inoculated with 10% (v/v) aliquots of 24 hr grownculture, respectively, to maintain the same cell count in pureculture and in the consortium. Selected isolates incombination of 3 to 10 were inoculated into NB for 8 hrs toform a consortium. Dye degradation procedure was repeatedto screen the best consortium from 15 different combinationsagainst mixture of all the three dyes.
The optimum ratio of all three dyes
(Mordant Black 17, Acid Blue113, and Acid Black 24) wasfound by mixing these dyes in different ratios (AB 113 : AB24 : MB 17, 50:50:50, 60:60:30, 50:75:25, 70:50:25 and65:65:20) followed by degradation with selected microbialconsortium. Dye degradation studies were carried out witheffective consortium (CN-1) in 250 ml conical flaskscontaining 50 ml mineral salt medium with 100 mg lmixture of all the three dyes. The medium was inoculatedwith 12 hr old 2% inoculum, incubated in an incubator shakerat 200 rev min at 30°C. Degradation of all the three azo dyeswere monitored spectrophotometrically by reading n-butanol extract of the culture medium containingdegradation product at 570 nm (Yatome 1981). Rate ofdecolorization was calculated from the difference betweenthe initial and final absorption values of the supernatant at
for mixed dye. Intracellular protein content, which is
used as an index of bacterial growth, was estimated of Lowrymethod (1957).
Biodegradation rate of dyes
was calculated by testing the kinetic data by first-order model(Lagergren, 1898).
Plackett Burman methodology (PB) was used
to screen (n) variables in (n+1) number of experiments(Plackett and Burman 1946). PB matrix was developedmanually and the screening design was set up for 7 variables(A – G) in two levels, high and low. In the present study,seven independent variables were screened in eightcombinations organized according to Plackett-Burmanmatrix. Each variable can be at a high level (+1), and a lowlevel (-1). Agitation and incubation were dummy variables.The medium components used in PBSD trials are given inTable 1.Consortium development :

GC-MS analysis :Culture supernatant containing
degradation products was filtered through 0.22 m filters. 25
l of this filtrate was subjected to HPLC analysis in
Shimadzu SLC–6B model equipped with SPD – 6AV UV-Visible Spectrophotometric Detector an dC–R 4 A
Chromatopac using a C-18 reverse phase HPLC column witha solvent system consisting of methanol and water. A lineargradient from 20% methanol (isocratic for the initial 2 min)increased to 100% over 10 min and was then maintained at100% concentration for 10 min with a flow rate of 1ml min .The culture supernantant containing dyes, as well as,degradation products were analyzed at their corresponding
.
Culture medium after 48 hr of incubation
(containing the degradation products) was centrifuged andsupernatant was extracted thrice with equal volume of ethylacetate, dried over anhydrous Na SO and then the solventwas evaporated in a rotary evaporator. This extract wassubjected to GC-MS analysis using GC-MS-QP 2010[SHIMADZU] MS spectrometer. The column used was VF-5ms, 30 m x 0.250 mm dia with film thickness of 0.25 μm andthe column oven was programmed between 70 and 300 C @10 ºC min with injection temperature of 240 C. Mass spectrawas recorded under scan mode in the range of 40–1000 m z .Compounds were identified using WILEY8.LIB.
A bacterial consortium CN-1 was constructed using
five different bacterial strains for degradation of 3 differentazo dyes namely Acid Blue 113, Acid Black 24 and MordantBlack 17. Isolation, identification and construction ofconsortium CN-1 and degradation of dyes separately by thisconsortium have been reported (Karunya 2014a).

Results and Discussion
et al.,the effluent contains different groups of dyes. Under such
conditions, microbial consortia, with organisms havingdifferent specificities, can perform treatment of dyecontaining effluent more efficiently, which is difficult oreven impossible for individual strains or species (Tony2009). Initial screening studies have resulted in isolation of10 different bacteria using 15 different bacterial consortia(CN-1–CN-15) and their ability to decolorize the dye mixturewas checked at 100 mg l in MSM (Table 2). The resultsclearly show that CN-1 was found to be comparativelyefficient in bringing about maximum decolorization(93.34%) of dye mixture after 48 hr of incubation. Khehra
(2005) reported decolorization of group of azo dyes by
consortia HM-4 containing ,
, and
. Higher decolorization efficiency of
consortium was to the concerted activities of the constituentstrains. Individual cultures might have transformed the dye tointermediates, which acted on the redox mediators forefficient transfer of reducing equivalents from the strains,leading to enhanced decolorization potential of theconsortium.
Three selected azo dyes were mixed in different ratios
and the ability of the consortium CN-1 to degrade this mixeddye was checked. It is clear from Fig. 1 that the consortiumdegraded the mixed dye when they were mixed in 65:65:20ratio (AB 113: MB17: AB 24). As the concentration of AB 24decreased, degradation increased indicating the recalcitrantnature of AB 24 as compared to AB 113 and MB 17.
PBSD has been used to identify the factors affecting
dye degradation by the microbial consortia. Theexperimental design for screening the medium componentsand the experimental values are given in Table 3. Screeningof medium components by Plackett Burmann design showedet al.,

wide variation from 10.29% to 92.07% which reflects the
importance of medium components to attain higherdegradation. Of all the variables tested, dye concentrationwas found to play an important role followed by temperatureand concentration of ammonium nitrate and glucose (Table4).
. Similar results were observed in degradation
of AB 113 (Karunya 2014b) and MB 17 (Karunya2014 a,c). Nanthakumar (2013) have reported dyeconcentration as one of the significant variable in theet al., et al.,
et al.It is clear from the table that dye degradation by the
consortium was high with low concentration of dye and lowconcentration of glucose provided temperature andammonium nitrate were held at high concentration and pHmaintained at 9degradation of Reactive Red 195 by a Termite Associated
Bacterial Consortium BUTC7. In contrast, Usha (2011)have reported yeast extract, aeration and temperature assignificant variables affecting Reactive Red 120, and dye andpH on Reactive Black 5 dye degradation byand . Glucose, yeast extract, aeration, inoculum,dye concentration and pH were reported as other main factorsthat showed significant positive effects on both dyedegradation.
The consortium exhibited a very short lag phase
reaching its log phase by 4 hrs of incubation. The growth rateincreased up to 14 hrs of incubation, reaching maximum of2.34 mg hr after which it reached the stationary phase. Theconsortium reached its decline phase after 26 hr of incubation(Fig. 2a). Regarding degradation, the consortium started todegrade the mixed dye when they are in their mid lag phase.The rate of degradation reached maximum of 6.6 mg h after4 hrs of incubation which started decreasing gradually to 4.4mg h by 16 hrs after which the decrease in the rate ofdegradation was found to be quite slow. Biodegradation ratewas calculated by testing the kinetic data with first-ordermodel. From the plot of log (B - B ) versus t, it was observedthat this model fits the data well (Fig. 2b). The k value wasfound to be 0.085 hr and R being 0.982.
HPLC chromatograms of the media containing
mixture of dyes at 100 mg l were analyzed at 0 hr and atdifferent incubation periods (24hr and 48hr). Scanning wascarried out at 3 different wavelengths (525nm, 565 nm and618 nm for Mb 17, AB 113 and AB 24 respectively) toidentify degradation of individual components of the mixtureof dyes. At all the tested wavelengths, peaks with identical Ret al.

values have been obtained making it difficult to identify the
individual dyes. This might be due to overlapping ofabsorbance of all the three dyes. It is evident from Fig. 3 thatthe peaks with R value of 3.8 disappeared from samples after24 hrs.
GC-MS spectra of ethyl acetate extract (Fig. 4)
showed many peaks of which two peaks were identified asthose of methyl salicylic acid and 2-naphthol with R valuesof 7.7 min and 12.5 min. Mass spectra corresponding to peakwith R value of 7.7 min indicated fragmentation pattern withm z values of 152, 120, 92 and 65 corresponding to methylsalicylic acid and the fragmentation pattern for R value 12.5min gave m z values of 144, 115, 89 and 72, confirming thepresence of 2-naphthol.
All the three dyes studied were azo dyes in which AB
113 and AB 24 were diazo dyes and MB 17 a monoazo dye.While AB 113 and MB 17 contained 2 naphthalene rings inT

-1their structure, AB 24 had 3 naphthalene rings. The presence
of 2-naphthol and salicylic acid in the culture medium clearlyindicated that the naphthalene part of any or all of these dyesmight have undergone degradation. 2-naphthol has beenidentified as one of the intermediate in degradation of MB 17(Karunya 2014a) by consortium CN-1. Salicylic acid isone of the typical intermediates in bacterial degradation ofnaphthalene (Annweiler 2000; Pumphrey 2007)which can easily be assimilated easily by the bacteria.
The current decolorization/degradation process
offers to be an advantageous bioremediation system fordecolorization of dyes in textile effluent, more particularly,azo dyes in that it is an aerobic treatment system, wherebytoxic intermediates like aromatic amines produced in effluentby abiotic and biotic system may be completely mineralized.This study was carried out to check the efficiency ofconstructed microbial consortium CN-1 to degrade a mixtureof dyes (AB 113, AB 24 and MB 17), which has been found tobe successful.
