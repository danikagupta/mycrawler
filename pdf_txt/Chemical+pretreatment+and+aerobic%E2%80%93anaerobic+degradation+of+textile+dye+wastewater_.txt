ABSTRACT  
 The aim of this work was to determine the optimal conditions and to obtain thermodynami c data for the 
decolorization of Acid Red 131 using an enzymatic system. The effect of physic -chemical parameters on 
decolorization was studied. The enzyme (laccase) activity was found to be 2.277 U/ µg. The decolorization of Acid 
red 131 by Aspergillus niger  were obtained at three different temperatures. The reaction followed first order kinetics. 
For enzyme catalyzed bio -degradation, reaction were found to be less enthalpy -driven (high positive ΔH values), with 
negative entropy (ΔS) indicating that in t he transition state, more complex ternary dye structures were formed. The 
negative values of ΔG explain the fast reaction rates at the transition state during biodegradation of the Acid Red dye, 
which is exoergonic by nature.  
Key words : Laccase, Decoloriza tion, Physico -chemical parameters, Thermodynamic data.  
INTRODUCTION  
The two major reasons for release of industrial dyes into the environment are through effluents from synthesis 
plants and from dye -using industries . Due to the complex structure and synth etic nature, dye degradation is a 
laborious process (Sosath, 1999).  These dyes have stability towards light, temperature, microbial attack and the color 
affects the photosynthetic activity (Couto et al., 2009).  Certain pollutants persist in the environment  for long durations 
are considered to be recalcitrant pollutants (Ambatkar mugdha & Mukundan usha, 2012). Because of stricter 
government legislation concerning the release of effluents into the environment, an increase in research towards the 
field of indu strial waste water treatment has raised  (Couto et al., 2013). To treat dye containing wastewater several 
physico -chemical methods includes adsorption, coagulation/flocculation, membrane filtration, precipitation and 
oxidation have been used but these are e xpensive and produce large amount of sludge which requires safe disposal 
(Franciscon et al., 2009). There is an enormous need to develop an economic and cost effective way of dealing with 
dyeing waste in face of ever increasing production activities. Biolo gical processes have received a growing interest as 
a viable alternative owing to their cost effectiveness ability to produce less sludge and environmental friendliness 
(Banat et al., 1996; Dubrow et al., 1996; Park et al., 2003). A wide variety of microor ganisms including Pseudomonas 
luteola, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aspergillus niger, Trametes versicolor, Aspergillus terricola, P.chrysosporium, 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida tropicalis, C. lipolytica, Spirogyra species (Ravikumar et al., 2012) have been 
reported and are capable of biological degradation of synthetic dyes.  Enzymatic systems have been developed for the 
decolorization and mineralization of azo dyes under certain environmental conditions (Pandey et al., 2007). 
Extracellular lignin -modifying e nzymes (LMEs) of certain white -rot fungi are responsible for the treatment of dye 
containing waste water (Pointing, 2001) and detoxify (Kumar et al., 2007) xenobiotic compounds under aerobic 
conditions (Mohorcic et al., 2006). Laccase is a part of larger g roup of enzymes termed the multicopper oxidases 
(MOC), (Komori et al., 2009) belonging to the group of blue -copper proteins (Minussi et al., 2007). Fungal laccases 
have been confirmed for their capability to degrade several azo dyes (Tauber et al., 2005; H usain, 2006). Many 
variables/factors that affect the enzyme production and decolorization are expressed by different taxa and culture 
conditions. The ability of microbes to carry out dye decolorization has received much attention, either individually or 
in consortia (Verma & madamwar, 2003; Moosvi et al., 2007).  
The aim of the present study was to investigate the kinetics and thermodynamics of effective Acid Red 131 
dye decolorization by enzyme laccase achieved from Aspergillus niger.

acetate buffer (pH 6.5) with a total volume of 5mL as described in Mansur et al., 2003. 1 U of  enzyme activity was 
defined as the amount of enzyme that elicited an increase in A465 (ε = 26,600 M−1 cm−1) of 0.1 absorbance unit per 
minute. Enzyme activity (equation 01) was calculated by using the formula,  
Enzyme  activity (Uml⁄)=[At−A0]×Dilution  factor ×Tota l volume ×1000
M.E.C×Enzyme  volume ×Time                       (01) 
Where  
A0 is the initial absorbance immediately after the enzyme addition  
At is the final absorbance of reaction mixture after incubation  
M.E.C is the molar extension coefficient of guaiacol.  
Protein assay was performed using standard Folin -Ciocalteau  method (1951) using bovine serum albumin as a 
standard protein.  
Dye decolorization : A.niger  from preserved culture was grown for 24 hrs under shaking conditions at room 
temperature in 250 mL Erlen meyer flask containing 100 mL nutrient broth (pH 7.4±0.2). The reaction mixture for all 
the decolorization studies consists of 100mg/L (w/v) dye in 100ml of 24 hr old culture. 5mL of sample was aliquoted 
at every 60 minutes and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min (Surwase et al., 2012). Decolorization was studied by 
monitoring the decrease in the absorbance at 550nm from the clear supernatant. The percentage of decolorization was 
calculated using the following equation (Equation 02).  
A=(Initial  absorbance )−(Final  absorbance )
Initial  absorbance×100                     (02)                          
Effect of Physicochemical parameter on dye decolorization : The effect of pH on dye decolorization was studied at 
different pH range (pH 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9). The effect of temper ature was studied at optimum pH at a temperature range 
(30, 40 & 500C). The effect of dye concentration towards decolorization of dyes was determined by incubating the 
reaction mixture at dye concentrations (25, 50, 75, 100mg/L) at optimum pH and temperatu re. Kinetics and 
thermodynamic parameters such as Entropy (ΔS), Enthalpy (ΔH) and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of dye decolorization 
was calculated using Eyring -Polanyi plot.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Enzyme activity : The protein concentration found using Folin -Ciocalteau method  (Lowry et al., 1951) was 
990.268(µg/mL). The specific activity of crude laccase enzyme was found using guaiacol as a standard substrate to 
yield 2.277(U/ µg).  
Effect of Physicochemical parameter on dye decolorization : The decrease in the sp ectral absorbance during 
decolorization of Acid Red 131 was recorded using UV -Visible Spectrophotometer (Elico, India). The o ptimum pH at 
which maximum decolorization occurred was  found to be pH 7.  The optimum temperature towards decolorization of 
Acid Re d 131 reported maximum decolorization at 300C. Proteus mirabilis  showed maximum decolorization at 
optimum pH and temperature between 6.5 -7.5 and 30 -350C. This shows that  decolorization occurred at neutral pH 
and 350C (Govindwar et al., 2010).  Dye concentration (mg/L) towards the decolorization of Acid Red 131 exhibited 
maximum decolorization at 75mg/L after 60 minutes incubation. The rate of decolorization was constant at different 
concentration, but with higher loads of dye demand more time to  be degraded. Ren et al., 2006 reported that decreased 
decolorization ability of Aeromonas hydrophila t o Crystal Violet was observed, when its concentration was increased.  
Thermodynamic studies on dye decolorization : The order of the reactions was determin ed by ﬁtting the best 
straight line obtained to rate equations for zero -order, ﬁrst -order and second -order reactions. Acid Red 131 
decolorization/degradation followed first -order kinetics.  The graphs showed that the kinetics for the degradation 
reactions followed straight lines with the best values of R (correlation coefﬁcient) for ﬁrst -order kinetics (Table 1). It 
was observed that the dye kinetic constant (k) values decreased as the temperature increases from 30 -500C. The 
decreases in the rate of degrada tion could be because of structural changes in the active site of the dyes that prevent 
the formation of the enzyme –dye complexes, or because of the absence of some enzyme mediator acting together with 
the laccase. By applying the Eyring –Polanyi equation ( 03) to the Acid Red 131 data, the thermodynamic data and 
kinetic constants at three temperatures were obtained.

thermodynamic data were obtained by using the Eyring - Polanyi equation, where ΔH is the enthalpy of activation, ΔS 
is the entropy of activation, R is the gas constant, and h is Planck’s constant. The Gibbs ener gy of activation (ΔG) was 
calculated by use of the equation ΔG = ΔH – TΔS.  
 The ΔH and ΔS values were found to be 13435.424 and -247.350 J mol−1 K −1, respectively (Table 2). The 
positive value of enthalpy explains the increasing rate of reaction with incr easing temperature and is endothermic 
decolorization process. The negative entropy indicates that the more ordered complex formed than the reactants. The 
high positive values of ΔG explain the low reaction rates during biodegradation of the reactive dyes ( Afonso et al., 
2012).  Results indicate that the reaction is exoergonic by nature, where ΔG of the reaction is negative, and supports 
fast reactivity at the transition state.

CONCLUSION  
 Crude laccase enzyme from Aspergillus niger  was used as a biocatalyst (enzyme) for the decolorization of the 
Acid Red 131. The effect of various process parameters such as temperature, Incubation time and dye concentration 
towards the decolorization of Acid Red 131 was studied.  The thermodynamic s tudies on decolorization follows first 
order kinetics and the reaction is exoergonic. RSM was successfully applied to determine the optimal operational 
conditions for maximum decolorization . This suggest that laccase from A.niger  has proved to be an effici ent and eco -
friendly for the decolorization of synthetic dyes.
