Soil and sediment solid/liquid partition coefficients (Kd) are used to indicate the relative mobility of  
radionuclides and elements of concern from nuclear fuel waste, as well as from other sources. The Kd  
data are inherently extremely variable, but also vary systematically with key environmental attributes. 
For soil Kd, the key variables are pH, clay content and organic carbon content. For sediment Kd, water type (freshwater versus marine) and sediment type (benthic versus suspended) are important.
This report summarized Kd data for soils and sediments computed from indigenous stable element 
concentrations measured at the Forsmark and Laxemar-Simpevarp sites. These were then compared to several literature sources of Kd data for Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Ho, I, La, Mn, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Np, 
Pa, Pb, Pu, Ra, Sb, Se, Sm, Sn, Sr, Tc, Th, Tm, U and Yb. The Kd data computed from indigenous 
stable element concentrations may be especially relevant for assessment of long-lived radionuclides from deep disposal of waste, because the long time frame for the potential releases is more consistent 
with the steady state measured using indigenous stable elements.
For almost every one of these elements in soils, a statistically meaningful regression equation was 
developed to allow estimation of Kd for any soil given a modest amount of information about the soil. Nonetheless, the median residual geometric standard deviation (GSD) was 4.3-fold, implying 
confidence bounds of about 18-fold above and below the best estimate Kd. For sediment, the values  
are categorised simply by water type and sediment type. The median GSD for sediment Kd as measured 
at the Forsmark and Laxemar-Simpevarp sites was 2.5-fold, but the median GSD among literature values was as high as 8.6-fold. Clearly, there remains considerable uncertainty in Kd values, and it is 
important to account for this in assessment applications.5Contents

Solid/liquid partition coefficients, also known as distribution coefficients and Kd, have been used 
in safety assessment calculations for nuclear facilities for many years. They endure because of their 
conceptual simplicity. The Kd is the ratio of the concentration of a nuclide on a solid phase (soil or 
sediment) divided by the equilibrium concentration in the contacting liquid phase (water). As Kd is used, this implies a linear, zero-intercept relationship between sorbed and non-sorbed species of the element, which is a convenient assumption but certainly not universally true. In most uses, an 
additional assumption is that the sorption is at equilibrium and is reversible. The conceptual model 
is most applicable for simple cationic species undergoing ion exchange reactions on simple charged surfaces. However, in practice Kd is measured and used for much more complex systems, and the 
lack of fit of the simple Kd model to the real system becomes part of the overall uncertainty in the 
values of Kd.
In a safety assessment, Kd is used as a quantitative indicator of environmental mobility of the element. 
In general, all isotopes of an element are assumed to have the same Kd value, because sorption is a chemical property generally unaffected by atomic mass or nuclear emissions. In soil, Kd is used to estimate leaching of elements through soil and uptake of elements from soil by plants. In sediments, 
Kd is used to partition elements between the water column and the sediments, which has implications 
for removal of the element from the water column by flushing and sedimentation.
Because Kd is a simplification, the values are necessarily empirical and highly dependent on the system  
where they are measured. The classical method of measuring Kd is to suspend pre-dried and ground 
samples of the solid (soil or sediment) in a tenfold larger volume of water, add the element of interest, shake the suspension for some time (hours or days), filter off the liquid and measure the concentration 
of the element in the liquid and on the solid. This is not very representative of an environmental setting, 
and so there are many variants among the methods.
For soils, the preferred method is to have the element introduced to the soil weeks or months before 
the measurement or to use contaminated soils collected in the field, the soil is incubated at field-like 
moisture and temperature before measurement, then the pore water present in the soil is extracted and both porewater and solids are analysed. The extraction requires some force, such as centrifugation. For bottom sediments, the ideal is to collect contaminated sediment in the field and to extract pore 
water when the sample drains. For suspended sediments, again sampling in the field is ideal and the 
solids are separated from the sample of the water column by filtration. However, these ideals are rarely met, and it is necessary to consider and interpret Kd measured in a variety of ways.
The calculation of Kd is concentration on the solids (mg kg
–1 dry solid) divided by concentration in 
the pore water (mg L–1), giving units of L  kg–1. These units are presented because they relate most 
closely to the units of measure used for the concentrations, and they are the most commonly used 
units for Kd in the literature. A more correct SI (Le Système International d’Unités) unit would be 
m3 kg–1, with values 1,000-fold lower than those in L  kg–1.
All values of Kd are assumed to be lognormally distributed based on the Central Limit Theorem, 
and the assumption of lognormal is generally supported by empirical evidence. Thus, all analysis 
was done on log-transformed values and summaries are of geometric means (GM) and geometric standard deviations (GSD).92 Objectives and structure of this report
This report provides a means to estimate Kd values for soils and sediments of the Forsmark and 
Simpevarp regions. The approach is threefold:
1. To compute Kd values from uncontaminated soils and sediments collected at Forsmark and 
Laxemar-Simpevarp. For both soils and sediments, the Kd values obtained from this are for 
desorption of the indigenous elements, and so interpretation is needed in applying these to the  
case of sorption of contaminant elements. For sediments, both freshwater and marine sediments, 
and both bottom sediments and suspended sediments were sampled.
2. To compare these site -specific Kd values to other sources of Kd values for similar media, interpret 
the similarities and differences and make judgments of which values would best represent the 
assessment scenario for disposal of nuclear waste.
3. To the extent possible, develop a predictive capacity to relate Kd to site properties, so that variation 
in Kd across the sites can be estimated.
The first sections of the report deal with soils, starting with a description by G.  Sohlenius (Sveriges 
geologiska undersökning, Uppsala) of the sampling done to obtain 7 samples from Forsmark and Laxemar-Simpevarp. The next section by S.C. Sheppard (ECOMatters Inc. Pinawa, MB, Canada) describes the methods used to measure desorption Kd values for indigenous elements in these soils, 
and sorption Kd values for I and Cl. This includes comparison of the values obtained to those in a 
data set obtained using the same methods for a broad range of Canadian agricultural soils.
The last section related to soils is a comparison by S.C.  Sheppard and B.L.  Sanipelli (ECOMatters Inc. 
Pinawa, MB, Canada) of the above Kd values to the general literature, including the recent compilation 
by the IAEA program Environmental Modeling for Environmental Safety /EMRAS 2008/, and the development of regression equations to predict Kd as a function of simple soil properties.
Sediments are dealt with in the final section by J.  Long, S.C.  Sheppard and B.L.  Sanipelli (ECOMatters 
Inc. Pinawa, MB, Canada). The sediment Kd was computed from previously published sediment and 
water concentrations for samples collected at Forsmark and Simpevarp. These values were for both freshwater and marine samples, and for both bottom- and suspended-sediment samples. These are 
compared to the general literature, including the recent compilation by /EMRAS 2008/. Apart from 
the values specific to each sediment type, no further predictive capacity was possible for sediment Kd.113 Sampling of soils
3.1 The studied sites
SKB performs site investigations for localisation of a deep repository for high level radioactive waste.  
The site investigations are performed at two sites, Forsmark in Östhammar municipality and Laxemar-
Simpevarp in Oskarshamn municipality, see Figure  3-1 and Figure  3-2, respectively. This report presents 
results from both these sites.
All known regolith in the Forsmark and Laxemar-Simpevarp areas was formed during the Quaternary 
period and is therefore referred to as Quaternary deposits (QD). After the latest deglaciation, both 
sites were completely situated below the level of the Baltic Sea. Most of the Forsmark area was situated 
below the level of the sea as late as 1000 years ago. The Laxemar-Simpevarp site started to emerge from the sea much earlier and most of the area was above the sea level 3000 years ago. The time available for soil forming processes has consequently been much shorter in the Forsmark area compared 
to the Laxemar-Simpevarp area.
Figure 3‑1. Location of the three sampled sites in Forsmark. The properties of the sites are shown in Table 3-1. 
Site A (AFM001076) is clayey silty till, Site B (PFM006024) is peat, and Site G (PFM002670) is clayey silty 
till with mull.12The Forsmark site is characterised by a flat topography gently dipping towards the east. Most of the  
area is covered by till /Sohlenius et al. 2004/. In parts of the area the till has a high content of clay and  
is to a large extent used as arable land. The till in Forsmark contains calcite emanating from Ordovician 
limestone situated north of the area. Calcite is easily dissolved by chemical weathering. However, the area has only been above the sea level for a relatively short period and weathering has consequently 
not dissolved the calcite present in the till soils.
The Laxemar-Simpevarp area is characterised by a relatively flat bedrock surface. In contrast to the  
Forsmark area the topography is characterised by a number of pronounced valleys. The highest areas 
are dominated by till and exposed bedrock, whereas the valleys, often used as arable land, are covered 
by a relatively thick layer of Quaternary deposits /Rudmark et al. 2005/. The till from the Laxemar-Simpevarp area is generally coarser grained compared to till from the Forsmark area. Clay, sand and peat are the dominating QD in the valleys in the Laxemar-Simpevarp area. A large proportion of these  
valleys are former wetlands where the groundwater table has been lowered by ditches. The clays from the Laxemar-Simpevarp area often contain considerable amounts of organic matter and are then referred to as clay gyttja (Table 3-1).Figure 3‑2. Location of the four sampled sites in Laxemar-Simpevarp. The properties of the sites are shown 
in Table 3-1. Site C (ASM001426) is sandy till, Site D (ASM001434) is clay gyttja, Site E (ASM001440) is 
peat and Site F (PSM000277) is clay gyttja.
133.2 Methods
Samples were taken from three and four sites in the Forsmark and Laxemar-Simpevarp areas respectively 
(Figures 3-1 and 3-2). At each site 10 sub-samples were taken to a depth of 30 cm. The individual 
sub-samples were “randomly” collected from an area of around 30 m2. The till samples were taken 
in spade-dug holes and the other samples were taken by the use of a hand-driven corer. The size of each sub-sample of peat was at least 200 g and the corresponding size of the other sub-samples was 
at least 100 g. Three additional samples were taken from each site using steel cylinders with known volumes. These latter samples were later used to determine the dry bulk density of the sampled deposits. All samples were placed in plastic bags and stored in a cold room before analyses.
The dry bulk densities were determined in laboratory after drying the samples in the steel cylinders 
at 105°C. The 10 sub-samples from each site were mixed into one general sample, which was used 
for further analyses. Grain size analyses, on material < 20  mm, were carried out on samples from five 
of the sites. The samples from the two peat areas were not analysed for grain size. The grain size 
distribution of coarse material (grain size 20–0.063 mm) was determined by sieving and fine mate -
rial (< 0.063 mm) with hydrometer analysis.
The five samples analysed for grain size were also analysed for contents of calcite (CaCO
3) and 
organic material. The CaCO 3 analyses were determined (grain sizes < 63μ) using Passon apparatus, 
/Talme and Almén 1975/ which measures the amount of CO 2 developing during the reaction between 
CaCO 3 and HCl. The content of organic material was measured by determining the weight loss after 
burning a sample at 550°C. That method is referred to as loss on ignition (LOI).
3.3 Results
The results from the determinations of dry bulk densities are shown in Table  3-2. The QD rich in organic 
material (clay gyttja and peat) have considerably lower densities than the till deposits, which are 
dominated by mineral particles.Table 3‑1.  The sampled sites in the Forsmark and Laxemar‑Simpevarp areas.

sampled at Forsmark and Laxemar‑Simpevarp
4.1 Objectives
The objectives in measuring soil solid/liquid partition coefficients (Kd, L  kg–1) for 7 soils include 
contributing to the database of Kd values that might be used in environmental safety assessment of 
the Forsmark and Simpevarp sites, but more importantly to evaluate if the Kd values of these sites 
are consistent with the Kds of other soils in the world.
If the Kd values from these 7 soils are consistent with those measured in other soils, then it would 
be appropriate and arguably preferable to use values drawn from a ‘global’ database of Kd in safety 
assessment applications. Conversely, should the 7 soils be unique from Kd values from other soils 
with similar texture and properties, then a detailed survey of Kd for the assessment sites may be advisable.
4.2 Methods
The methods used have been described by /Sheppard et al. 2007/, and that paper includes comparison of variations in the methods. The preferred method, and method used here (and described in more 
detail below), was to incubate the soil at least 7 days at field capacity moisture content, and then 
extract the pore water by centrifugation at about 6,000 m s
-2 for 1,000 s. Both the soil solids and 
the pore water were analyzed for elemental composition. The soil samples were kept at the field 
sampling moisture content prior to incubation, the only drying done was that necessary to get wet 
samples to a state that could be physically handled (partial grinding and mixing). After the pore water was extracted, the soil samples were dried for analysis and to obtain moisture content data.
The field -moist or partially dried soil was placed in a 60  mL plastic syringe body. Deionized water was  
added very slowly until the first drop of water dripped from the bottom of the tube. The soil was then 
considered to be at field capacity moisture. The tube was weighed to determine the amount of water added, and the top and bottom openings were covered with parafilm (parafilm is a laboratory wrap pre-
venting moisture loss). Average soil and water weights for all samples were 67 g and 31 g, respectively.
The sample was left undisturbed for one week, then the parafilm was removed and the tube centrifuged 
to remove the porewater. The porewater was filtered through a 0.45‑μm syringe filter and split. One 
subsample was acidified to pH < 2 for inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) 
analysis of 51 elements, the other subsample was not acidified and was analyzed by ICP-MS for I and by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) for Cl (these unacidified samples were 
stored frozen if there was a delay before analysis).
Using indigenous elements to measure Kd has the advantage that the soil is more likely at equilibrium 
even for very slow reactions, including ecological reactions such as cycling through vegetation. However, 
most Kd values in the literature are from spiking experiments, where the element is added just prior 
to the measurement of Kd. Thus, spiking was done to measure Kd for I and Cl. The two spiking solutions were a commercial 1,000 mg L
–1 analytical standard for I and a 1,000 mg L–1 solution for Cl prepared 
from reagent-grade NaCl 2. Both solutions were sent for analysis, giving results of 985 mg L–1 for Cl 
and 996 mg L–1 for I, agreement within 2%.
For soil samples that were spiked, the soil was weighed into the syringe tube in the same manner 
described above, and the bottom opening was covered with parafilm. About 5  mL of spiking solution 
was added to the soil in the tube, and then the soil was left for an hour to absorb the solution. The syringe 
tubes were weighed to determine the amount of spike added (average of 5.4 g). The soils were then 
wetted, incubated and centrifuged as above. Not all samples, and in particular the clay-like samples, 
absorbed the spiking solution well. Thus, after centrifugation, the spiked soil solids were removed and analyzed for I and Cl.16Analysis of the soil solids, including the spiked soils, was by ICP -MS for all elements except I and Cl. 
For I and Cl, the analysis was by INAA, which gives a true total concentration. Analytical results by 
ICP-MS were obtained for each soil sample using the Ultratrace 1 method of Activation Laboratories 
(http://www.actlabs.com/). This method is an aqua regia (acid) partial extraction, which may not extract all elements from mineral matrices, but the more volatile elements should remain in solution. Aqua regia does not decompose all silicate minerals in the soil sample, however, the argument is that the 
elements in the silicates do not exchange with the pore water so it may be appropriate to exclude them 
in the analysis of soil elemental composition for Kd.
The concentrations of I in the spiked soils ranged from 40 to 600 mg kg
–1, varying because of differences 
in soil bulk density and the efficiency with which the spike solution was absorbed. The concentrations 
of Cl in the spiked soils ranged from 100 to 4,600 mg kg–1. These are rather high, as intended to be 
sure that porewater concentrations were detectable. All samples were analyzed in duplicate, with generally acceptable (small) differences in concentration between the duplicate pairs.
The calculation of Kd is concentration on the solids (mg kg
–1 dry soil) divided by concentration in the 
pore water (mg L–1), giving units of L  kg–1. For elements with relatively low Kd values, where the Kd 
is in the same order of magnitude as the soil moisture content, also in units of L  kg–1 dry soil, then it is 
important to account for the amount of pore water dried onto the soil solids when the solids are prepared 
for chemical analysis (this correction has little effect, but is still valid, for elements with high Kd).
Because Kd for Cl is low, and for consistency, this correction was applied to all Kd values here. The 
correction is Kd (corrected)  = Kd (uncorrected)  – MC, where MC is the soil moisture content (L  kg–1 dry soil) 
of the soil when dried for analysis. Because of the properties of these soils, they had high moisture contents after centrifugation, and this correction was quite important for Cl Kd values. The MC values 
for soils of sites A to G were 0.073, 8.2, 0.016, 3.2, 2.1, 2.8 and 0.071 L  kg
–1, respectively. This range 
underscores the wide range in soil properties among these samples, a wider range than many of the 
soils used to generate the Kd values reported in the literature.
4.3 Results
All of the measured Kd values are shown in Table  4-1 (geometric means (GM) are shown for duplicates). 
With the exception of the spike values for Cl and I, these are Kd values for elements present in the soil as collected (called native- or indigenous-element Kd values). Native Kd values are typically 
higher than Kd values from recent element spiking because the retention processes in the soil have had very long times to come to (quasi) equilibrium. More recent additions (spikes) of elements have lower Kds and are implicitly more mobile than native elements. However, in a nuclear waste manage-
ment context where assessments span millennia, native Kd values may be the most appropriate.
For Cl and I, the native Kds values were almost all larger than the corresponding spike Kds, as expected 
based on equilibration time. Additionally, the spiked soils were at much higher concentrations: 
/Sheppard and Evenden 1988/ indicated that Kd for I was linear over 8 orders of magnitude in soil 
concentration (up to 100 mg kg
–1), but /Sheppard et al. 1996/ noted non-linearity above ~1 mg I kg–1. 
Non-linearity would result in lower Kd at higher soil concentrations, consistent with the finding here.
Sites B and E were peat soils, and in these the Kd value for Cl was relatively high. This is expected 
because Cl is present in soils as an anion and only reaction with organic matter has an appreciable 
effect on retention (i.e. causes higher Kd). /Sheppard et al. 2006/ recommended a GM Kd value of 
0.1 L  kg–1 for Cl for all soils, in line with the spike Cl Kd values measured in the SKB soils, but 
substantially lower than the native Cl Kd values. /Sheppard et  al. 2006/ recommended a GSD of at 
least 10, implying 95th percentile confidence bounds of 0.001 to 10 L  kg–1, encompassing most of  
the measured SKB values.
/Thibault et al. 1990/ gave a range of Kd for I of 1 to 25 L  kg–1. V alues of Kd are important to assessments 
only within certain ranges /Sheppard 2005a/, and these values are in the range to be important for all 
assessments. The reason for the high native Cl Kd values may be because plants growing on the sites 
will have intercepted Cl from oceanic salt spray, this elevated source may have resulted in greater incorporation of Cl into recalcitrant plant organic materials that then become part of the soil. These would elevate the Cl concentration on soil solids but not affect soil pore-water Cl concentrations, 
leading to a high native Kd. Site D seems to be an exception, with a lower Kd for native Cl than the 
Cl spike.17Table 4‑1.  Solid/liquid partition coefficients (Kd, L  kg–1) for Chlorine, Iodine and the suite of elements

a Kd values could not be computed because soil or pore water concentrations were below detection limits, the Kd limit 
values are shown.18The native Kd values for I are substantially higher than those for Cl, but the spike values are similar. 
/Sheppard et al. 2006/ suggest GM Kd values for sand, loam, clay and organic soils of 8, 20, 10 and 
80 L kg–1, and a GSD of at least 10. These GM values are between the native and spike I Kd values 
here, but again the 95th percentile confidence bounds encompass most of the measured Kd values. 
The reason for the high native I Kd values may be the same as for Cl, because I again is reactive with organic materials. Additionally, the sorption of I in soil is redox dependent, in fact toxicity to I can 
occur in paddy soils that have been drained and are then reflooded /Sheppard and Motycka 1997/.
It seems there is a shift, perhaps temporary, in Kd when soil redox conditions change. The Kd for I is 
higher for aerated soils relative to the same soils flooded. Because several of the SKB soils appear to have been collected from wet environments, and then partially dried for handling and exposed to air, this may have caused higher Kd values than if Kd had been measured in situ. This may appear as an 
experimental artefact, but the counter argument is that if the soil is used in future for food production (in an assessment scenario), then the aerated Kd is more appropriate.
Thus, this evidence would suggest that if Kd values for Cl and I are important to the assessment, there 
may need to be special consideration in the choice of values, including perhaps more measurement. Higher Kd values would imply longer accumulation times and higher steady-state soil concentrations.
Table 4-2 is a comparison of the native Kd values for 51 elements from the 7 SKB soils versus those 
in a database of Kd for Canadian soils measured with the same methods /Sheppard et al. 2007/, and 
with the review /Thibault et al. 1990/ from which the Kd values in /IAEA 1994/ were obtained. In 
general, the SKB soils had lower Kd values than the Canadian soils, but were within the ranges observed for the Canadian soils and generally in the ranges from /Thibault et al. 1990/. Table 4-2 
shows the 5
th and 95th percentiles of the Canadian data, the geometric mean (GM), and geometric 
standard deviation (GSD) of the Canadian data, and the GM for the SKB soils.
Most meaningful are the last three columns. In these, the position of the SKB data within the Canadian 
data, expressed as a percentile, is given. Thus, for Al, the GM of the SKB soils was equal to the 13%  
percentile of the Canadian data: 13% of the Canadian data were lower and 87% were higher. On average, 
the GM of the SKB soils was at the 27th percentile of the Canadian data. This would normally be 
considered evidence that they belong to the same population of data.
There are elements where the SKB data were less than the 5th percentile or greater than the 95th  
percentile (Table 4-2). To put these “outlier” values into context, it is important to consider the 
elements relevant to nuclear fuel waste, highlighted in bold and colour (Re is highlighted because  
it was once considered an analogue for Tc). Among these elements, only Se had Kd values outside 
the 5th and 95th percentiles (they were below the 5th percentile), and the value for SKB soils was 
below the range from /Thibault et al. 1990/.
It is only speculative to assign a cause to this, but it may be because several of the SKB soils appear 
to have been collected from wet environments. Selenium is redox sensitive, and the partial drying 
and exposure to air of the samples of wetland soils may have caused a shift toward oxidized, soluble 
selenates resulting in a lower Kd value in the samples than in agricultural soils that are almost always well drained. The evidence would suggest that if Kd values for Se are important to the assessment, there may need to be special consideration in the choice of values, including perhaps 
more measurement. In contrast to Cl and I, the Se values are lower than expected.
Figure  4-1 further illustrates the comparison between the Kd values from the SKB soils and the larger 
database of Canadian soils. There seems no verifiable reason that the Kd values are below the median 
of the Canadian data. One difference that may be relevant is that most of the Canadian soils are agricultural, hence with low organic matter contents and subject to fertilization and tillage.
4.4 Conclusions
The Kd values for SKB soils generally fall in the range of Kd values measured in other soils. There were three possible exceptions of potential importance to assessment of nuclear fuel waste disposal. 
The elements Cl, I and Se had Kd values outside the ranges noted from other soils. The elements Cl 
and I were found to have high Kd values, which would suggest greater retention in soils. In contrast, the measured Kd value for Se was low, suggesting greater mobility.19Table 4‑2.  Comparison of native‑element Kd values (L kg‑1) from 7 SKB sites to values measured using the same methods for 
200 Canadian agricultural soils and to the survey by /Thibault et al. 1990/ which was the source for Kd values in /IAEA 1994/.

equations to estimate soil Kd for use in risk assessment
5.1 Introduction
Soil solid/liquid partition coefficients (Kd, L  kg–1) are presented for the elements Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, 
Fe, Ho, I, La, Mn, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Np, Pa, Pb, Pu, Ra, Sb, Se, Sm, Sn, Sr, Tc, Th, Tm, U and Yb, 
and these Kd values are to be representative of the soils present at Forsmark and Simpevarp. Values 
of Kd for many, but not all, of these elements have been measured in 7 soils from Forsmark and Simpevarp (the previous section), mostly as desorption of indigenous element.
Most of the above elements have very long -lived isotopes, and for the long -term assessment of nuclear 
fuel waste, it makes sense to select Kd values that represent steady state conditions, such as Kd values  
measured by desorption of indigenous element. However, some of these elements have only short -lived 
isotopes and are not progeny of long -lived decay chains. For these, it is relevant to consider short-term 
reactions, as discussed for each element in the following section.
5.1.1 Limits on effectiveness of Kd values
An additional aspect of soil Kd values is that there are minimum and maximum values that will have  
a significant effect in an assessment, depending on the time scale of the assessment /Sheppard 2005a/. 
Values of Kd below about 0.1 L  kg–1 are indicative of high mobility, and variation of tenfold around 
this value, and especially lower, will not have a large effect on assessment results because the element is essentially as mobile as water.
Thus, it is not productive to create a detailed predictive model for Kd in this range. Similarly, there 
is an upper limit Kd beyond which the element can be considered essentially immobile for a specific 
assessment time frame. Thus, it is again not productive to create detailed predictive models for high 
values, in the order of 10
4 L kg–1 and above. In this report, Kd values below and above these limits 
are reported, but with less emphasis on predictive equations.
5.1.2 Sources of data
There are several general sources of Kd values to draw upon for application to the SKB sites, each with advantages and disadvantages.
1. For a subset of the elements (Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Ho, I, La, Mn, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Pb, Sb,  
Se, Sm, Sr, Th, U and Yb), Kd was measured using the indigenous element concentrations in  
3 soils from the Forsmark area and 4 from the Simpevarp area (data shown in the previous section). 
These are obviously ideal, except that 7 soils may not be enough to sufficiently characterise the sites. 
Additionally, these values represent desorption of indigenous elements. Contaminants from a waste 
facility will be less strongly sorbed initially (lower Kd), but in the long term (centuries to millennia) the Kd values should converge with those of the indigenous elements as measured in these soils.
2. For two elements (Cl and I), Kd was measured using artificially spiked element concentrations 
in 3 soils from the Forsmark area and 4 from the Simpevarp area (data shown in the previous 
section). These are short-term sorption Kd values and were substantially different from those measured by desorption of indigenous elements (see 1, above), and so are of uncertain value.
3. For a series of these elements (Cl, I, Np, Ra and U), recent extensive literature reviews have been 
completed for Ontario Power Generation /Sheppard et  al. 2006/, and the data sets generated (named 
OPG in this report) for these were available for further interpretation. These Kd values span a 
wide range in soil properties, but also a wide range in experimental methods.244. For the same subset of elements as in 1 (above) and measured by the same laboratory, there is 
a data set (named NTE in this report) of Kd values for about 200 soils. Although the number of 
soils allows for development of some predictive capability, the soils were almost all production 
agriculture soils, and so most were mineral soils with relatively low organic carbon contents  
and near-neutral pH. It can be argued that a critical group or reference individuals will focus  
food production on such soils, but these types of soils do not dominate spatially at Forsmark  
and Simpevarp.
5. For Tc, there is a data set of Kd values for 34 soils that were predominantly organic /Sheppard et al. 1990/. Although limited because they include few mineral soils, the results are fairly conclusive that there are two Kd values important for Tc: one very near zero for aerobic soils  
and a somewhat higher value for anaerobic soils.
6. For most of these elements, soil Kd values are available from older compendia. Perhaps the most 
widely cited is /IAEA 1994/, which was derived from /Thibault et al. 1990/ and /Sheppard and 
Thibault 1990/, and the data set from the latter is available for further interpretation. These span  
a wide range in soil properties, but also a wide range in experimental methods.
7. The EMRAS program of the IAEA will replace the /IAEA 1994/ report with a new report, and will have a revised set of Kd values. A pre-publication list of values is available for comparison 
here (personal communication, S. Fesenko, IAEA).
8. The ongoing scientific literature is a diffuse source of further Kd values, again these span a wide range in soil properties, but also a wide range in experimental methods. Reference citations are 
given in each section below.
There is a balance to be achieved between deriving site-specific parameter values and utilizing as 
much of the larger global population of Kd values as possible. /Sheppard 2005b/ concluded from 
meta-analysis that as more transfer data become available, with more and more information to categorise these data, an asymptote in uncertainty is approached. This is not a surprising result; in geospatial problems this is analogous to a semi-variogram. For Kd, /Sheppard 2005b/ suggested an asymptotic 
geometric standard deviation (GSD) of about 5-fold, based on the data from /Thibault et al. 1990/. 
The implication is that doing detailed site-specific measurements of Kd is not likely to improve on this level of uncertainty, so an argument to focus an assessment on site-derived data to the exclusion 
of other data is not well founded.
It is very relevant to include off-site literature values in the choice of Kd for a given assessment. 
However, this does not exclude refining the choice of values to represent soil properties relevant to 
the site. Thus, in this report, where possible, multiple regression equations were used to summarise 
Kd values from several sources, and these were subsequently used to derive best estimates for the 7 sites sampled at Forsmark and Simpevarp. It is envisioned that these equations could be used to derive best estimates for other soils at these sites, bearing in mind that there is an inherent variability  
in Kd values on the order of 5-fold, so that best estimate Kd values within about 25-fold would not be significantly different (for example by t test at infinite degrees of freedom).
5.1.3 Soils from the SKB sites
The soils sampled as described earlier in this report were sent to a laboratory in Canada for measurement of Kd, and as a result were analysed for mineral particle size fractionation, organic carbon content 
and pH (Table 5-1). Some of these measurements from laboratories in Sweden were previously 
reported (Table  3-3), and in general the two sets of values agree. The values in Table  5-1 were used  
for regression analysis because they were done in the same laboratory as the NTE soils.255.2 Methods
5.2.1 Development and use of multiple regression equations
Where possible, regression equations were developed to enable prediction of best -estimate Kd values for 
a specific set of soil properties. The dependent variable was log 10(Kd), with the exception of Kd for 
Tc and Cl where it was log 10 (Kd+1)1. The statistical method to derive predictive equations reported 
here is forward stepwise multiple regression, using Statistix-9 software (Analytical Software, 
Tallahassee, FL, www.statistix.co m).
In this method, the user defines the dependent variable and a series of potential independent variables. 
The process begins by including the one independent variable that explains the largest portion of 
the variance in log Kd. It is included only if it’s corresponding regression coefficient is statistically 
significant at P  < 0.05. In the next step, the next most useful independent variable is included, again 
only if it’s corresponding regression coefficient is statistically significant.
This proceeds until no further independent variables significantly contribute to explaining the variance 
in log Kd. At each step, if the inclusion of a new independent variable renders the coefficient of a previously included variable non -significant at P  < 0.05, the non -significant variable is removed from 
the regression – effectively it has been made redundant. In the end, the regression equation may 
contain anywhere from none to all the independent variables, with only those that are statistically 
significant remaining in the equation.
Interactions among independent variables are not implicitly included in the stepwise regression process. 
For soil Kd, pH and clay content are often the most influential variables, and there is an inherent 
interaction between them in that acidic soils are often low clay content soils (sands). Experience with the NTE data set showed that it was often useful to consider the clay-content · pH interaction in the 
regressions for Kd. This was done by creating a new independent variable as the product clay · pH 
(the units of this product are pH %).
1 The reason for the exception with Tc and Cl is that a Kd of zero is among the expected values for aerobic 
soils, and statistically this means that some measured values may be negative. A negative Kd is theoretically 
impossible, but if the amount sorbed is estimated by the difference in solution concentration after contact with 
soil, then because of normal experimental variability on occasion more Tc will be measured in solution than was 
initially added, and it is statistically correct to represent this as a negative Kd. Thus, using log (Kd+1) allows 
log transformation of almost all near -zero Kd data. This approach was published by /Sheppard et al. 1990, 
Sheppard 2003/.Table 5‑1.  Properties of soils from Forsmark and Simpevarp (see Tables 3‑1 to 3‑3 for further data).

1 determined by ALS Laboratories, hydrometer method on the mineral fraction only.  
2 determined by ALS Laboratories, wet oxidation for sites A, C, and G and loss on ignition for sites B, C, D, and E.  
3 determined by litmus paper on soil water paste allowed to stand for > 30 minutes.26There is potential to include a large number of independent variables, however to be practical these 
should be limited to parameters commonly measured both in literature studies and in soils at the 
SKB sites. In all the data sets, the minimum list of independent variables was:
• soil pH (generally using pH determined in distilled water rather than in dilute salts, primarily 
because it is more commonly reported, the pH in water is usually about 1 pH unit higher than  
that in dilute salt),
• soil clay content (expressed as a percent of the mass of the mineral content of the soil, which repre -
sents mineral soils well but has less value for organic soils that have very low mineral contents),
• soil organic carbon (expressed as a percent of the mass of the whole dry soil, and lower than soil 
organic matter content by a factor of about 1.72),
• the product of pH · clay‑content.
To illustrate the regression process, below is the development of the equations for log(Kd) for Cs. In this example, a ‘dummy’ variable was used to differentiate sorption data (dummy  = 1) from desorption 
data (dummy  = 0). This variable was ‘forced’, and so the first iteration of the regression process gave 
the equation:
Log(Kd) = 4.62 – 1.40·(dummy) where the coefficient –1.40 was significant at P  < 0.0001.
In the second iteration, the pH · clay interaction was the next most important independent variable 
and so was added to the equation as:
Log(Kd) = 4.29 – 1.28·(dummy) + 0.0020·(pH)·(clay) where both coefficients –1.28 and 0.0020 were significant at P  < 0.0001.
The third iteration included soil pH as the next most important independent variable, and this iteration 
did not remove any of the previous independent variables:
Log(Kd) = 3.817 – 1.248·(dummy) + 0.00154·(pH)·(clay) + 0.0798·(pH)
 where the coefficient –1.248 was significant at P  < 0.0001, 0.00154 was significant at  
 P = 0.0004 and the coefficient 0.0798 for soil pH was just significant at P  = 0.013.
The fourth interation found no other independent variables that would have statistically significant 
coefficients, and did not identify any of the previously entered variables that were now redundant. Clay content was the next closest, but the level of P for its coefficient if it was entered was P  = 0.076, 
higher than the cut-off value of P  = 0.05. Thus, the final equation was that derived in the third intera -
tion (above). This equation had an r
2 = 0.41. As will be discussed below in the section on Cs, it was 
decided to average the results of sorption and desorption experiments, so the value of ‘dummy’ was set to 0.5, and the regression constant became 3.817 – 1.248·(0.5) = 3.19.
Not all the Kd values had these independent variables explicitly measured in the manner required. 
Where possible, surrogate data were used and interpreted into the required units. For example, the report of a soil being a ‘clay’ or ‘clay-loam’ soil implies soil clay content of > 28%. Relative few 
soils have clay contents > 50%, so when only the text description was available the value used to 
represent soils reported as clay or clay-loam was 30%. Similarly, soils reported as silts or loams  
were assumed to have 15% clay, and those reported as sands: 5% clay.
In absence of pH data, a value of 6.5 was assigned, as representative of a global average pH. In 
absence of soil organic carbon or organic matter data, soils described as mineral were assumed to have 2% organic carbon and those described as organic: 30% organic carbon. In regression analysis, 
it is preferred to have a distribution of values for the independent variables, not a lot of repeated 
values. We investigated the impact of these assumed values using Kd for I as the test case.27The ‘OPG’ Kd values were first assigned the assumed values of pH, clay and organic carbon 
contents based on the soil descriptions in the report /Sheppard et al. 2002/, and regressions were 
developed. Then the original papers were re-reviewed and the actual pH, clay and organic carbon 
contents were obtained. Regression equations using the real data were very similar to those using the assumed values in terms of the independent variables included in the final equation and the signs and general values of the regression coefficients. Obviously, using assumed values for independent 
variables is not ideal, but it is important to not lose Kd data from the regression because Kd data are 
not abundant, and our experience indicates that the assumed values of pH, clay and organic carbon contents do not mislead.
For some of the data sets, soil silt content and sand content were available, and these were included 
as independent variables. Although silt and sand contents occasionally have predictive capacity, it 
must be remembered that soil clay, silt and sand contents sum to 100%, so these variables inherently 
interact. When the situation arises, it is probably better to use clay content alone than the combination of silt and sand contents, even with a small loss in predictive capacity, just because clay content is more commonly measured and reported.
A best-fit equation is not universally relevant. Ideally, it should only be used to interpolate Kd 
values, that is to be used for predictions only within the range of the independent variables of the 
‘training’ data set (the data set used to derive the equation). Even for interpolation, the relevance may be in question if the frequency distributions and interactions of the independent variables in  
the training data set differ from those where predictions are needed. However, there is also a need  
to cautiously extrapolate using regression equations.
For either interpolation or extrapolation, it is important to compare predictions to measurements 
from a ‘validation’ data set. In this case, the measured Kd values in the 7 SKB soils are a validation 
data set. If there is agreement, approximately within the 25 -fold confidence bounds expected for Kd, 
then there is argument to concatenate the training and validation data set and develop new overall 
regression equations that encompass all the available data.
In reporting the regression equations, two statistical quantities are also provided here. First is the 
coefficient of determination, r
2, as a fraction of the variance explained by the model. Second is the 
residual GSD, which is the antilog of the square root of the mean square error from the regression model 
of log(Kd) values. The residual GSD is a measure of the variance in Kd not explained by the independent 
variables, and would be appropriate for defining the statistical dispersion for stochastic modeling.
5.2.2 OPG data sets
/Sheppard et al. 2006/ summarised several reviews of Kd done for Ontario Power Generation (OPG). These reviews simply reported GM and GSD, with little attempt to modify or categorise the values for 
soil properties. To apply this to the SKB sites, the underlying literature was revisited and data for soil 
properties were obtained.
5.2.3 Canadian NTE Kd data set
/Sheppard et al. 2007/ reported the development of a Kd data set for agricultural soils in Canada, and it has expanded since that time to include over 200 soils, called here the ‘NTE’ soils. Because the 
results are referenced throughout this report, it is appropriate to examine the range of properties of 
these soils, and the correlations among the independent variables (Figure 5-1). Among these soils, clay content, pH and organic carbon content were all significantly (P  < 0.05) positively correlated, 
but the correlation coefficients were all < 0.3. The domains of these variables are fairly broad relative 
to most agricultural soils, but clearly organic soils are not well represented.
5.2.4 Thibault et al. data set
The data set prepared by /Thibault et  al. 1990/ and subsequently published by /Sheppard and Thibault 
1990/ was the sole source of Kd data for the /IAEA 1994/ compendium. The IAEA compendium also included interpolation and extrapolation to derive estimates of Kd using plant/soil concentration ratios as 
a guide. The data set of /Thibault et  al. 1990/ has been re-entered into computer files to allow regression 
analysis for the SKB sites. The OPG data sets included all the Thibault et  al. data that were still considered 
relevant, and so care was taken to not double account for these data in the regression analyses.285.2.5 Newly compiled literature
In addition to the established data sets, a review was done of the recent literature. This was targeted 
to be of varying intensity. For well reported ‘nuclear’ elements such as Cs, Th and elements where 
recent reviews were already available (the OPG data sets and others), it was considered not necessary 
to do detailed further searches. For these elements, only particularly important recent papers were acquired. For most of the metals relevant to other industries, such as Cr, Ni and Pb, there is a lot of data and the search emphasis was on papers that dealt with a series of soils, or that presented predictive 
equations. For some elements, notably Ce, La, Nb, Nd, Sm and Yb, there is scant literature and it 
was necessary to be as exhaustive in the search as possible.
5.2.6 EMRAS data set
The report /IAEA 1994/ is undergoing revision, under the EMRAS program. The detailed data set compiled by EMRAS had been made available to date (October, 2008), and the best estimates and 
ranges were just recently made available for comparison only. Almost all values have been revised 
from the /IAEA 1994/ report (Figure 5-2). Comparison to the equations presented in this report was  
done by computing estimates for soils as described by EMRAS. The following properties were assumed to represent the EMRAS soils: All soils – clay 15%, pH 6.5, organic carbon 2%; Sand soils – clay 
5%, pH 5.5, organic carbon 0.5%; Loam soils – clay 15%, pH 6.5, organic carbon 2%; Clay soils  
– clay 30%, pH 6.5, organic carbon 2%; Organic soils – clay 15%, pH 5.5, organic carbon 30%.
Note that there is in general a tenfold variation about the 1:1 line in Figure 5-2. The median GSD for 
the EMRAS data was 4, implying at least a 16  -fold difference is needed to declare values significantly 
different. Obviously, half of the elements were even more variable than this.

Also shown is the scatter plot of pH versus clay content.295.3 Results
5.3.1 Presentation
Each element is discussed separately in the following sections, ordered alphabetically by the element 
symbol. For each, there is a table showing, where possible, the Kd values for samples of the 7 SKB 
sites. The predictions for these 7 sites using regression equations developed from the major data sets 
are shown, as a range 1 GSD above and below the actual estimate. Finally, in some cases predictions from other literature equations are shown.
Coloured fonts for the Kd values for the SKB sites denote the comparison to the data sets: pink indicates 
the observed SKB data were higher than 1 GSD above all the data set estimates, and blue indicates the observed SKB data were lower than 1 GSD below the data set estimates. These values are also  
in a box. Any values not marked in this manner were within 1 GSD of the predicted values.
Under the tables is a discussion, as for almost every element there were features that needed explanation 
or further development. Finally, based on the discussion, a proposed final equation, which does not include the results of the SKB sites, is presented.
5.3.2 Ce – Cerium
The Kd values for Ce were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 209 Canadian soils in the NTE program (Table 5-1). The stepwise regression of the NTE soils included soil pH, sand content,  
silt content and the clay*pH interaction, with a residual GSD of 3.5.Figure 5‑2. Comparison of EMRAS values and /IAEA 1994/. Each point is a different element and soil type.

G Forsmark clay till 88,000 5,600–67,00030To contrast with the above desorption Kd values, there have been some measures of sorption Kd. 
/Schimmack et al. 1987/ measured Kd every 3 m along a 150-m transect, using 20-d contact times 
with 139Ce in a soil suspension. The median Kd was 310 L  kg–1, a range of 170–740 L  kg–1, all lower 
than the desorption Kd values above but within the 95th percentile confidence bounds based on a GSD 
of 3.5. Although these authors reported that equilibrium had been established, one could argue that it  
was not in equilibrium in the pedogenic time scales of millennia, and larger Kd values would apply for 
long-term assessment. /EMRAS 2008/ found 5 reports giving 11 Kd values with a GM of 1,200 L  kg–1, 
range of 120–20,000 L  kg–1, and GSD of 5.
However, the longest lived isotope, 144Ce, is generated from fission reactions, and has a half life of 
285 d. Thus, it is probably not a long -term hazard even from nuclear fuel waste, and so the value may 
not be critical to an assessment. Note that stable Ce is relatively abundant.
Soils from SKB sites C and G were outside the ±1 GSD range of the regression estimates (see above), 
but are both within the ±2 GSD range, thus within the 95th percentile confidence bounds. This includes 
soil B whose properties are well beyond the range in the NTE soils. Because the values are large, 
assessment results may not be strongly dependent on them, and so either the values measured in 
the SKB soils or predictions from the equations should be suitable for assessment purposes. The equation from the NTE data set is:
Log(Kd) = 3.51 + 0.54400 · (pH) – 0.022 · (sand) – 0.022 · (silt) – 0.00471 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 3.5 and r
2 = 0.27. This gives values for the SKB soils of 59,000, 3,400, 
11,000, 1,000, 4,200, 11,000 and 19,000 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.3 Cl – Chlorine
The Kd values for Cl were measured in the 7 SKB soils both using desorption of indigenous Cl and 
sorption of spiked stable Cl (Table 5-2). Additionally, there was an extensive literature search (OPG, 
/Sheppard et al. 2006/ and references therein), but this only yielded 7 other Kd values. These values 
were in either of two groups: mineral soil or organic soil.
The desorption Kd values were all higher than the corresponding sorption Kd values, consistent with  
the concept that less soluble forms may become more prominent with time. Some of this may be because  
of biological incorporation by soil microbes or by the plants of Cl into recalcitrant organic compounds, 
which then persist in the soil /Bastviken et  al. 2007/ and related papers). The overall lack of data makes 
it necessary to combine all the SKB and literature desorption Kd values available (ignoring the sorption 
Kd values above), and the resulting GM values2 are:
1.4 L  kg–1 for mineral soils (< 20% organic carbon, Kd based on 11 soils) and,
150 L  kg–1 for organic soils (> 20% organic carbon, Kd based on 3 soils).
2 Note that because the Kd value for mineral soils approaches zero, and the data set included 3 zero values,  
the GM was computed from: Table 5‑2.  Measured (SKB) and predicted (using the OPG data set) Kd values (L kg‑1) for Cl.

1 Sites A, C and G are clearly mineral soils and so the mineral-soil Kd is shown, sites B and E are clearly organic  
soils and the organic-soil Kd is shown.  Sites D and F have just high enough organic carbon contents to be  
considered organic, but it is not clear which Kd values apply.
 []{}log( 1)10 1averageK dGM+=−31/EMRAS 2008/ found 4 reports giving 22 Kd values with a GM of 0.3 L  kg–1, range of 0.04–0.9 L  kg–1, 
and GSD of 3.
Because of the very large uncertainty, more effort may be required to measure Kd for Cl, and a larger 
GSD is appropriate, perhaps about 10 (approximately the highest GSD generally found for Kd values).
5.3.4 Co – Cobalt
The Kd values for Co were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 208 Canadian soils in the NTE program (Table 5-3). The stepwise regression of the NTE desorption Kd data included soil pH,  
sand content, silt content and the clay*pH interaction, with a residual GSD of 4.0. The stepwise regression of the /Thibault et al. 1990/ sorption Kd data included soil pH, organic carbon and clay, with a residual GSD of 7.2, see also Figure 5-3.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 8 reports giving a total of 118 Kd values, GM values were sand: 260 L  kg
–1, 
loam: 810 L  kg–1, clay: 3,800 L  kg–1 and organic: 87 L  kg–1. EMRAS also noted a low Kd for soils 
with pH ≤ 5 of 12 L  kg–1.
In general, the Kd results from desorption of indigenous Co (SKB, NTE, /Gooddy et al. 1995/ and 
/Watmough et al. 2005/) agreed with those for sorption of radiocobalt /Thibault et al. 1990/, see Figure 5-3. The largest discrepancies were for SKB sites A, C and G which were the mineral soils, 
interesting because both the desorption and sorption data sets were strong in numbers of mineral soils 
and weak in numbers of organic soils. This suggests a more distinct aging effect in mineral soils than in organic soils. However, the 95
th percentiles (2 GSD above and below the GM, note that Figure  5-3 
shows 1 GSD above and below the GM) overlap. Thus, combining the NTE and Thibault et al. data 
sets is reasonable (n = 342) and by stepwise regression this gives the equation:
Log(Kd) = 0.898 + 0.339 · (pH) + 0.0267 · (organic carbon)
with a residual GSD of 8.4. This gives values for the SKB soils of 1,300, 3,800, 440, 1,400, 1,000, 
1,300 and 650 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.5 Cr – Chromium
The Kd values for Cr were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 112 Canadian soils in the NTE program (Table  5-4). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included clay content and the clay*pH 
interaction, with a residual GSD of 3.1.
There is a marked difference between the desorption Kd values from the NTE study and the sorption 
Kd values reflected in the /Thibault et al. 1990/ and recently acquired literature data sets /Covelo 
et al. 2004, 2007ab, De Groot et al. 1998, Fulekar and Dave 1992, Hellerich and Nikolaidis 2005, Sheppard and Hawkins 1991, Vega et al. 2006/. The sorption Kd values may be lower because the recently applied Cr has not reached full equilibrium with the indigenous Cr (and may not for a very  
long time). Given that the longest-lived Cr isotope (
51Cr) has a half-life of 27.7 d, long-term equilibrium  
in soil is not relevant. Thus, the sorption data sets are the most relevant. /EMRAS 2008/ found 6 reports  
and 31 values, GM values were sand: 8.4 L  kg–1, loam: 45 L  kg–1, clay: 14 L  kg–1 and organic: 160 L  kg–1, 
and these are also more consistent with the sorption data sets.

to the residual GSD.33/Thibault et al. 1990/ had relatively few (22) values for Cr. The 19 values for Cr(III) had a GM of 
160 L  kg–1 (GSD = 9.0), and the 3 values for Cr(VI) had a GM of 5.9 L  kg–1 (GSD = 6.6). These 
were combined with more recent literature sources resulting in 135 values. Among these, there was 
an apparent difference in relationship to pH and clay content for low and high Kd values (shown for 
pH in Figure  5-4). Because speciation of Cr between relatively immobile Cr(III) and the mobile and 
ephemeral Cr(VI) is difficult to determine or predict in soil, there is a good possibility that the two apparent populations of data reflect the two species of Cr. Assuming this, the stepwise regression of 
the Kd values above 100 L  kg
–1 (83 values) gave the equation:
Log(Kd) = 1.79 + 0.287 · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 5.2 and r2 = 0.21. This gives values for the SKB soils of 4,500, 2,000, 280, 
590, 590, 560 and 320 L  kg–1, respectively, almost all above the observed values. A linear regression 
of the remaining 51 Kd values gave the equation:Log(Kd) = 0.973
with a GSD of 3.6 (no independent variables were significant). This gives a value of 9.3 L  kg
–1.
Because speciation of Cr is not easily predicted, it may be prudent in an assessment to use the functions

Soil pHlog Kd for Cr345.3.6 Cs – Cesium
The Kd values for Cs were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 171 Canadian soils in the NTE 
program (Table 5-5). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included only the clay*pH interaction, 
with a residual GSD of 4.0. The stepwise regression of the /Thibault et  al. 1990/ data set (246 values) 
included pH and the clay*pH interaction, with a residual GSD of 9.8. The stepwise regression of the 
/Sanchez et al. 2002/ data set (53 values, most very acidic and some highly organic) included pH and clay content, with a residual GSD of 5.0.
There is a notable difference between Kd based on desorption of indigenous Cs and Kd based on 
sorption of radiocesium (
134Cs or 137Cs), which constitute most of the values summarised by /Thibault 
et al. 1990/. Cesium sorption reactions in soil are known to be slow, often referred to as aging and 
extending over several years or even decades. In part, this is because Cs slowly becomes entrapped 
in the interlayer spaces of clay mineral platelets. In contrast, indigenous Kd values account for much of the interlayer bound Cs. From the perspective of waste disposal, Kd values representing near steady state are probably most appropriate, so the values might be aligned with the upper values of sorption 
studies, but perhaps not as high as Kd values for desorption of indigenous Cs.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 32 reports and 469 values, GM values were sand: 530 L  kg
–1, loam: 3,500 L  kg–1, 
clay: 5,500 L  kg–1 and organic: 270 L  kg–1, and these are also more consistent with the sorption data 
sets rather than the long-term equilibration reflected in the desorption data sets.Combining the data of /Thibault et  al. 1990/ and /Sanchez et  al. 2002/, a total of 299 values, the stepwise 
regression gave the equation:Log(Kd) = 2.26 + 0.0112 · (pH) + 0.127 · (clay)
for sorption Kd values, with a residual GSD of 9.5 and an r
2 = 0.07. This would be an appropriate 
equation for assessments dealing with 134Cs (half -life = 2.06 d) and shorter lived isotopes, and perhaps 
137Cs (half-life = 30.2 a), because decay may prevent complete chemical equilibrium.
The NTE data, a total of 171 values, gave by stepwise regression the equation:Log(Kd) = 4.31 + 0.00183 · (clay) · (pH)
for desorption Kd values, with a residual GSD of 4.0 and an r
2 = 0.09. This would be an appropriate 
equation for assessments dealing with 135Cs (half-life = 2 · 106 a), and perhaps 137Cs, because complete 
chemical equilibrium may be reached.The proposed equation was developed by stepwise regression from the combined desorption and 
sorption data (470 values), with a dummy variable to differentiate these (0 for desorption, 1 for sorption). 
Assuming an average of desorption and sorption is one approach for long -term assessment, the dummy 
variable is assigned the value 0.5, giving the equation:
log(Kd) = 3.19 + 0.0798 · (pH) + 0.00154 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 7.4 and an r
2 = 0.40. From this equation, the estimates for the SKB soils are 
6,300, 6,000, 4,000, 6,300, 4,800, 6,000 and 4,700 L  kg–1, respectively. The scatter plot (Figure 5-5),

nd pore water concentration non-detectable, this value computed using detection limit.35differentiating the sorption from the desorption data shows the large variation in the data. /Sanchez 
et al. 2002/ and others point out that accounting for K behaviour in soil will markedly improve predictions 
of Kd for Cs, but this was not included here as the required information is not commonly available.
5.3.7 Fe – Iron
The Kd values for Fe were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 127 Canadian soils in the NTE program (Table 5-6). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included only soil pH, with a residual 
GSD of 4.0. The stepwise regression of the /Thibault et al. 1990/ data set (44 values) included only  
the clay*pH interaction, with a residual GSD of 5.2.
There is a notable difference between Kd based on desorption of indigenous Fe (the SKB and NTE 
soils, above) and Kd based on sorption of 
59Fe, which constitute most of the values summarised by 
/Thibault et al. 1990/. Iron sorption reactions in soil are confounded by Fe+++ precipitation as oxides 
on particle surfaces. These precipitates are not readily exchangeable with the Fe in soil pore water, 
except that there is redox variation in most soils over time that may cause some chemical reduction of 
precipitated Fe+++ to mobile Fe++, which may then exchange with pore water Fe. As such, indigenous Fe 
will give high Kd values because these Kd values account for much of the Fe oxide coatings.

desorp36/EMRAS 2008/ found 2 reports and 23 values, GM values were sand: 320 L  kg–1, loam: 890 L  kg–1, 
clay: 1,600 L  kg–1 and organic: 1,400 L  kg–1, and these are also more consistent with the sorption 
data sets rather than the long-term equilibration reflected in the desorption data sets.
Sorption of a spike of 59Fe will initially be a surface sorption process, and this is what is most likely 
represented in the relatively low Kd values in /Thibault et al. 1990/. With time, it is anticipated that 
the 59Fe will become more incorporated into the Fe precipitates. However, 55Fe and 59Fe are the only 
radioactive isotopes, and with half lives of 986 d and 45 d, neither represents a long-term radioactive hazard. Because Fe is so plentiful in the environment, small increments also do not present a chemical 
toxicity hazard.
Given the short half lives, the equation for sorption Kd values from Thibault et al. (results shown 
above) is proposed for use:
log(Kd) = 2.01 + 0.00442 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 3.2 and an r
2 = 0.22. This gives values for the SKB soils of 190, 780, 110, 410, 
310, 350 and 140 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.8 Ho – Holmium
The Kd values for Ho were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 161 Canadian soils in the NTE 
program (Table 5-7). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included soil pH and the clay*pH 
interaction, with a residual GSD of 3.1.
Interpolation of the data from /Thibault et  al. 1990/ using plant/soil concentration ratio data was the 
methodology behind the Kd values in /IAEA 1994/. The Kd values for Ho (sand: 250, loam: 800, 
clay: 1,300 and organic: 3,000 L  kg–1) were not based on any measurements. /EMRAS 2008/ apparently 
found only the values from /IAEA 1994/ and recommended 930 L  kg–1. No other Kd data were found 
for Ho. It is proposed that the equation from the NTE data be used:
Log(Kd) = 2.15 + 0.338 · (pH) – 0.00094 · (clay) · (pH)with a residual GSD of 3.1 and an r
2 = 0.30. This gives values for the SKB soils of 19,000, 1,400, 
6,800, 5,100, 2,500, 5,300 and 9,600 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.9 I – Iodine
The Kd values for I were measured in the 7 SKB soils both using desorption of indigenous I and 
sorption of spiked stable I (Table  5-8). Additionally, there was an extensive literature search (OPG, 
/Sheppard et al. 2006/ and references therein) that documents Kd for 114 soils. These included, where appropriate, the data summarised by /Thibault et al. 1990/. The stepwise regression of the literature values included soil carbon content and the clay*pH interaction, with a residual GSD of 9.3.
The measured Kd values using indigenous I were almost all higher than the literature values plus 
1 GSD, and in contrast the measured Kd values using a spike of stable I were almost all lower than the 
literature values less 1 GSD. Many of these measured values were within the range of the literature 
±2 GSD, which corresponds with the 95
th percentile confidence bounds. However, this range is 
~7,500-fold, even after accounting for the most significant soil properties (organic carbon, pH  
and clay content).

nd Not detectable in either solids or pore water.37Most of the Kd values from the literature search were based on contact times of at least several days, 
an essential feature because Kd for I will continue to increase for some time. This is probably part 
of the explanation for the large differences between the desorption and sorption Kd values measured 
for the SKB sites, where sorption was for 7 d. In addition, some of the indigenous I in these soils, which is included in the desorption Kd values, may have been biologically incorporated by plants and subsequently incorporated as strongly bound forms in recalcitrant organic matter. Including 
these more ecological processes would extend the equilibration time to many years. The desorption 
Kd values may better represent a very long-term steady state, and although it is not clear, these are probably the more appropriate data for a long-term assessment calculation.
The frequency distributions for log Kd and the independent variables in the literature data set from 
/Sheppard et al. 2006/ were relatively broad (Figure 5-6). Although included, there were few soils 
below pH 5 and above 20% organic carbon, and so the domain relevant to some of the SKB soils Table 5‑8.  Measured (SKB) and predicted (using the OPG data set) Kd values (L kg‑1) for I.

measured in the literature.38is not well represented. However, the results for the SKB soils that are outside the ±2 GSD range 
(above and Figure 5-7) from the literature are not just the exceptional soils in terms of pH and 
organic carbon.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 9 reports and 250 values, and they separated these into studies those with 
I– versus IO 3– and with soils with a range of soil organic matter contents, but none of the Kd values 
would be statistically different between these categories. Among soil textures, GM values were sand: 4.1 L  kg
–1, loam: 8.0 L  kg–1, clay: 11 L  kg–1 and organic: 32 L  kg–1. These values are more  
like the short-term sorption values.

5.3.10 La – Lanthanum
The Kd values for La were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 209 Canadian soils in the NTE pro -
gram (Table 5-9). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included pH, clay, sand and silt contents, 
with a residual GSD of 3.0.
/Gooddy et al. 1995/ measured Kd in 18 acidic sandy soils, obtaining a GM of 14,000 L  kg–1, generally 
consistent with the values from the Canadian and SKB soils, albeit /Gooddy et al. 1995/ used similar 
methods. Five other values were found /Shan et al. 2002, Cao et al. 2001/, and they had a GM of 
380 L  kg–1. EMRAS found one value for a sand of 5,300 L  kg–1. If one combines the above, the 
following regression equation can be formed:
Log(Kd) = 3.22 – 0.0506 · (clay) + 0.230 · (pH) + 0.00617 · (clay) · (pH)with a residual GSD of 3.9, an r

5.3.11 Mn – Manganese
The Kd values for Mn were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 205 Canadian soils in the NTE pro -
gram (Table  5-10). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included pH and the clay*pH interaction, 
with a residual GSD of 10. The stepwise regression of the /Thibault et al. 1990/ data set (113 values) 
included only soil pH, with a residual GSD of 7.0.

of the studies in the summary by /Thibault et al. 1990/ represent sorption of 54Mn. As with Fe, there 
are relatively stable Mn oxides in soils. These precipitates are not readily exchangeable with the 
Mn in soil pore water, except that there is some redox variation in most soils over time that may 
cause partial reduction to mobile Mn++ and then exchange with pore water Mn. Sorption of a spike 
of 54Mn will initially be a surface sorption process, and this is what is most likely represented in 
the Kd values in /Thibault et al. 1990/. With time, it is anticipated that the 54Mn will become more 
incorporated into the Mn precipitates. In contrast, indigenous Kd values account for much of the Mn 
oxide coatings.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 4 reports and 83 values, GM values were sand: 980 L  kg–1, loam: 1,100 L  kg–1, 
clay: 4,500 L  kg–1 and organic: 160 L  kg–1.
The longer lived radioactive isotopes of Mn are 54Mn (312 d) and 53Mn (3.8 · 106 a) so that, unlike Fe, 
it is not possible to limit the proposed Kd values to short-term equilibria. From the perspective of 
waste disposal, Kd values representing near steady state are probably most appropriate. So the values 
might be aligned with the upper values of sorption studies, but perhaps not as high as Kd values for desorption of indigenous Kd.
The proposed equation was developed by stepwise regression from the combined desorption and 
sorption data (318 values), along with 84 values from the more recent literature, using a dummy variable to differentiate these (0 for desorption, 1 for sorption). Assuming an average of desorption 
and sorption is appropriate for long-term assessment, the dummy variable is assigned the value 0.5, 
giving the equation:
log (Kd) = –0.330 + 0.457 · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 12, an r

The Kd values for Mo were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 185 Canadian soils in the NTE program

a residual GSD of 2.5. The stepwise regression of the /Thibault et  al. 1990/ data (24 values) included clay 
and soil pH, with a residual GSD of 3.2.

1995/ measured Kd for Mo on 6 acidic sandy soils with a GM of 1,600 L  kg–1, consistent with the 
above values. The desorption Kd values from the NTE data set and from /Gooddy et al. 1995/ also 
agree with the data of /Thibault et al. 1990/, which were mostly sorption of 99Mo. Stepwise regression 
after combining these data (215 values) gave the equation:
Log (Kd) = 1.70 + 0.0718 · (clay) + 0.0325 · (organic carbon) – 0.00873 · (clay) · (pH)with a residual GSD of 3.3 and r
2 = 0.19. This gave best estimate values for the SKB soils of 70, 
740,000, 61, 1,400, 5,600, 1,500 and 76 L  kg–1, respectively, which are reasonable except for site B. 
Clearly, more data for very acidic peat soils is needed.
5.3.13 Nb – Niobium
The Kd values for Nb were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 92 Canadian soils in the NTE program 
(Table  5-12). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included clay, pH and the clay*pH interaction, 
with a residual GSD of 4.7. /Thibault et  al. 1990/ did not find Kd values for Nb, and the values given  
in /IAEA 1994/ of 160 to 2,000 L  kg–1 were only extrapolations.
EMRAS found 3 studies reporting a total of 11 values, with a GM of 1,500 L  kg–1 and GSD of 4. No 
other reports were found. The regression from the NTE data was:
Log (Kd) = 2.45 + 0.0960 · (clay) + 0.348 · (pH) – 0.0159 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 4.7 and r2 = 0.13. This gave best estimate values for the SKB soils of 44,000, 
940,000, 16,000, 44,000, 82,000, 61,000 and 26,000 L  kg–1, respectively.

The Kd values for Nd were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 208 Canadian soils in the NTE program 
(Table  5-13). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included pH, sand, silt and the clay*pH interaction, 
with a residual GSD of 3.2.
/Gooddy et al. 1995/ measured Kd for Nd on 20 acidic sandy soils with a GM of 16,000 L  kg–1. Neither 
/IAEA 1994/ nor /EMRAS 2008/ have proposed values for Kd. There are no long -lived isotopes of Nd, 
so the Kd for indigenous Nd is probably appropriate. The equation from the NTE data set is:Log (Kd) = 3.523 + 0.476 · (pH) – 0.0200 · (sand) – 0.0185 · (silt) – 0.00435 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 3.2 and r
2 = 0.25. This gives values for the SKB soils of 40,000, 3,200, 
8,300, 9,000, 4,300, 10,000 and 15,000 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.15 Ni – Nickel
The Kd values for Ni were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 198 Canadian soils in the NTE pro -
gram (Table 5-14). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included pH, clay, sand and the clay*pH 
interaction, with a residual GSD of 2.4. The regressions of the data from /Thibault et al. 1990/ with 
44 soils included only pH, and those of /Vandenhove et al. 2009/ with 143 soils, from /Sauvé et al. 2000/ with 139 soils and from /Watmough et al. 2005/ with 46 soils all included pH and log (organic carbon
1).
The regressions of data from other literature (171 values all using stable Ni only, /Covelo et al. 2004, 2007ab, Fulekar and Dave 1992, De Groot et al. 1998, Echeverria et al. 1998, Gooddy et al. 1995, Jalali and Moharrami 2007, Lee 2006, Lin et al. 2004, Ponizovsky et al. 2008, Rabie Ahmed Usman 
2008, Sauvé et al. 2003, Staunton 2004, Van den Hoop 1995, Veeresha et al. 2003, Vega et al. 2006, 
Watmough et  al. 2005, Yin et  al. 2002/) were done in three sets: sorption only, desorption of indigenous 
element only, and combined with a dummy variable to differentiate these (0 for desorption, 1 for sorption). Assuming an average of desorption and sorption was accomplished setting the dummy variable to 0.5.
SKB site B is different from the others with low pH and very high organic carbon content. The various 
estimates above differ most for this soil; the estimates from desorption data predict the highest Kds 
for site B, whereas the estimates from sorption data predict the lowest Kds. This implies that there are few surface sorption sites for Ni in this organic soil, but a substantial portion of the indigenous Ni is strongly held, perhaps non-exchangeably bonded to the organic matter.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 12 reports and 64 values; GM values were sand: 130 L  kg
–1, loam: 180 L  kg–1, 
clay: 930 L  kg–1 and organic: 1,100 L  kg–1. EMRAS also differentiated Kd based on pH, with pH  < 5: 
14 L kg–1, 5 < pH < 6.5: 58 L  kg–1 and pH > 6.5: 820 L  kg–1.
Several Ni isotopes have long half lives; so in the context of long -term assessment of waste management, 
the desorption Kd values are of value. The relationship of sorption and desorption Kd values to pH, 
clay and organic carbon content were similar, with sorption Kd values effectively displaced about 
60-fold lower. By using a dummy variable, both sorption and desorption data could be combined. This 
was done for all the data available (NTE, Thibault et  al. and other literature), resulting in 410 values. The 
stepwise regression, substituting 0.5 for the dummy variable, was:
Log (Kd) = 0.718 + 0.233 · (pH) + 0.0148 · (organic carbon)with a residual GSD of 4.2 and r
2 = 0.55. The predictions for the SKB soils are 170, 230, 81, 160, 120, 
150 and 110 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.16 Np – Neptunium
No Kd values for Np were measured in the SKB soils. There was an extensive literature search 
(OPG, /Sheppard et al. 2006/ and references therein) that summarised 82 Kd values (Table 5-15). 
For all of these soils, the stepwise regression included organic carbon and the clay*pH interaction 
with a residual GSD of 9.5. Of these there were 5 organic soils and these were best represented by a simple geometric mean (GSD = 4.0). The stepwise regression from the data of /Thibault et al. 1990/ included pH, organic carbon and the clay*pH interaction, with a residual GSD of 3.9.43Table 5‑14.

nd pore water concentration non-detectable, this value computed using detection limit.44The two sets of predicted values agree quite well, although there is the potential for some overlap in 
the original sources (it appears that none of the same papers were used, but some of the same authors 
appear in both data sets). Nonetheless, the two data sets were combined and the equation was:
Log (Kd) = –1.42 + 0.307 · (pH) + 0.0429 · (organic carbon) + 0.00638 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 6.8 and r2 = 0.43. The estimates for the SKB soils are 9.2, 2,100, 1.7, 76, 50, 
55 and 3.4 L  kg–1, respectively.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 3 reports and 26 values, GM values were sand: 14 L  kg–1, loam: 23 L  kg–1 and 
organic: 81 L  kg–1. There was no estimate for clay but for all soils it was 36 L  kg–1.
5.3.17 Pa – Protactinium
The /IAEA 1994/ had interpolated values of 550, 1,800, 2,700 and 6,600 L  kg–1 for sand, loam, clay 
and organic soils, respectively. There was no actual Kd data to support this; the interpolation was 
based on plant/soil concentration ratios, which may have themselves been extrapolated. /EMRAS 
2008/ reported values of 2,000 L  kg–1 for all soils, 1,380 L  kg–1 for mineral soils and 6,600 L  kg–1 for 
organic soils, based on 4 measurements. These values are recommended for SKB.
5.3.18 Pb – Lead
The Kd values for Pb were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 197 Canadian soils in the NTE program (Table  5-16). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included pH and sand content, with a 
residual GSD of 3.0. /Thibault et al. 1990/ only had 14 Kd values, so they were combined with recent literatures values /Covelo et al. 2004, 2007ab, Chen et al. 1995, De Groot et al. 1998, Echeverria et al. 1998, Fulekar and Dave 1992, Gooddy et al. 1995, Lee 2006, Lee et al. 1998, MacDonald and Hendershot 2006, Rabie Ahmed Usman 2008, Sastre et  al. 2006, Van den Hoop 1995, Veeresha et  al. 
2003, V ega et  al. 2006, Watmough et  al. 2005/. The resulting stepwise regression included clay content, 
organic carbon and the clay*pH interaction, with a residual GSD of 10. The equation from /Carlon et  al. 
2004/ was based on 247 values from 5 authors, all of whom generated independent regression equations.Table 5‑15.  Predicted (using the OPG and Thibault et al. data sets) Kd values (L kg‑1) for Np.

Note that the equation presented by /Watmough et al.  2005/ has coefficients almost identical to those of /Carlon et al. 
2004/ and so is not computed separately here.45As with Fe and Mn, there is a large pool of stable element Pb in soil, and there is interest in both the 
Kd for radioactive isotopes and for stable Pb. Relatively few studies reporting Kd for Pb use 210Pb (or 
other radioactive isotopes). From the perspective of nuclear fuel waste management, 210Pb (half-life 
22.3 a) will not reach the surface because of migration of 210Pb, but rather the migration and decay of 
its nuclear parents. Some of this 210Pb will be from decay of gaseous Rn that may decay in the soil or 
in the atmosphere over the soil. Thus, the entry of 210Pb into the soil has unique aspects compared to 
all the other isotopes and elements of interest. Our assumption is that Kd values measured for stable 
indigenous Pb in soil are appropriate for 210Pb.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 5 reports and 23 values, GM values were sand: 220 L  kg–1, loam: 10,000 L  kg–1 
and organic: 2,500 L  kg–1. It was not specified whether these were based on 210Pb or stable Pb, the 
latter would be at much higher molar concentrations than the former, and this may affect Kd. The values from the NTE and /Thibault et  al. 1990/ data sets and the recent literature generally overlap. 
Thus the NTE and Thibault et al. data were combined, giving the regression:
Log (Kd) = 2.41 – 0.043 · (clay) + 0.216 · (pH) + 0.0214 · (organic carbon) + 0.00601 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 7.7 and r
2 = 0.20 and estimates for the SKB soils of 6,100, 1,300, 3,300, 3,900, 
1,900, 3,300 and 3,900 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.19 Pu – Plutonium
No Kd values for Pu were measured in the SKB soils nor in Canadian soils in the NTE program. 
Stepwise regression of the /Thibault et  al. 1990/ data set combined with the data of /Skipperud et  al. 
2000, Smith et  al. 2006, Roussel-Debet 2005/ (176 values) included soil pH and organic carbon, with 
a residual GSD of 6.6 (Table  5-17). These are the data that were used to predict the Kd values for the 
SKB soils below.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 7 reports and 62 values, GM values were sand: 400 L  kg–1, loam: 950 L  kg–1, 
clay: 1,800 L  kg–1 and organic: 760 L  kg–1.
The values for sites B, D, E and F, the organic soils, differ as a group from the remaining mineral 
soils. Clearly, organic carbon content seems to be important. Figure 5-8 shows the relationship, 
which appears to be heavily dependent on the few observations with high organic carbon content. The overall regression equation was:
Log (Kd) = 2.00 + 0.150 · (pH) + 0.0318 · (organic carbon)
with a residual GSD of 6.6 and r
2 = 0.11. This gives values for the SKB soils of 960, 20,000, 630, 
2,600, 3,100, 2,400 and 760 L  kg–1, respectively.

No Kd values for Ra were measured in the SKB soils nor in Canadian soils in the NTE program. 
Stepwise regression of the data in a recent literature review (OPG, /Sheppard et  al. 2006/ and references 
therein) data set (38 values) included only soil pH, with a residual GSD of 16 (Table  5-18). Stepwise 
regression of the /Thibault et al. 1990/ data set (19 values) included only clay content, with a residual GSD of 28. All of these soils had organic carbon contents < 20%, and so SKB site B was well outside the range, and sites D, E and F were just beyond the range.
/Vandenhove and van Hees 2007/ reported 9 Kd values with a GM of 12,000 L  kg
–1. /EMRAS 
2008/ found 8 reports and 51 values. GM values were sand: 3,100 L  kg–1, loam: 1,100 L  kg–1 and 
clay: 38,000 L  kg–1.
Combining the data from /Sheppard et al. 2006, Thibault et al. 1990, Vandenhove and Van Hees 
2007/ gave a total of 67 values, resulted in the equation:
Log (Kd) = 1.56 + 0.0599 · (clay)
with a residual GSD of 36 and r2 = 0.13. This equation does not apply to soils much above 20% organic 
carbon. For the SKB sites, the estimates are 130, (95,000), 42, 1,500, 2,000, 1,300 and 73 L  kg–1, 
respectively. The value for site B is in brackets because it is an extrapolation in terms of organic carbon 
content; although the equation does not have organic carbon as an independent variable.

The Kd values for Sb were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 197 Canadian soils in the NTE 
program (Table 5-19). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included pH and the clay*pH  
interaction, with a residual GSD of 2.2.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 5 reports and 152 values, GM values were sand: 17 L  kg–1, loam: 61 L  kg–1, 
clay: 140 L  kg–1 and organic: 75 L  kg–1. /Gooddy et  al. 1995/ measured desorption Kd for indigenous 
Sb in 13 acidic sandy soil with a GM of 580 L  kg–1. /Thibault et al. 1990/ found sorption Kd values 
for 125Sb in 6 soils, with a GM of 2,400 L  kg–1 (GSD 3.9). These few data agree with the predictions 
from the NTE data, and so the NTE equation is proposed for use:
Log (Kd) = 3.74 – 0.175 · (pH) + 0.00083 · (clay) · (pH)
with, as noted above, a residual GSD of 2.2 and r2 = 0.16 and estimates for the SKB soils of 450,

5.3.22 Se – Selenium
The Kd values for Se were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 82 Canadian soils in the NTE program 
(Table 5-20). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included clay content and pH, with a residual 
GSD of 3.3. The stepwise regression of the /Thibault et al. 1990/ data included only soil pH, with a 
residual GSD of 1.7.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 10 reports and 172 values. GM values were sand: 56 L  kg–1, loam: 220 L  kg–1 
and clay: 240 L  kg–1. /Dhillon and Dhillon 1999, Wang and Liu 2005, Ashworth et  al. 2008/ collectively 
reported 19 Kd values with an overall GM of 110 L  kg–1. Combining these 19 values with the NTE 
and Thibault et al. data sets (123 values) gave the regression equation:
Log (Kd) = 1.79 + 0.133 · (pH) – 0.00163 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 3.4 and r2 = 0.13 and estimates for the SKB soils of 360, 85, 280, 170, 140,

and the clay*pH interaction, with a residual GSD of 3.1.
/Gooddy et al. 1995/ reported Kd for 14 soils with a GM of 10,000 and GSD of 3.7. /EMRAS 2008/ 
reported only the values previously reported in /IAEA 1994/, which were interpolated and not based

/Nakamaru and Uchida 2008/ reported 4 Kd values with a GM of 9,400 L  kg–1. /EMRAS 2008/ 
found 4 studies and 12 Kd values, with an overall GM of 1,600 L  kg–1. Combining the /Nakamaru  
and Uchida 2008/ data with the NTE data gave the regression:
Log (Kd) = 3.60 – 0.0983 · (organic carbon)
with a residual GSD of 2.7 and r2 = 0.21 and estimates for the SKB soils of 3,800, 0.013, 2,700, 35,

nd pore water concentrations non-detectable, these values computed using detection limit.495.3.25 Sr – Strontium
The Kd values for Sr were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 197 Canadian soils in the NTE 
program (Table 5-23). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included pH and organic carbon 
content, with a residual GSD of 2.9. The stepwise regression of the /Thibault et al. 1990/ data (257 
values) included only clay content, with a residual GSD of 5.7.
As with Cs, there is an expectation that Kd values for sorption of Sr, as is often considered with 
radiostrontium, will be lower than the Kd values for indigenous stable Sr. However, the NTE desorption and /Thibault et al. 1990/ sorption values do not differ substantially. Strontium does not undergo the interlayer fixation as does Cs, so more rapid equilibrium for Sr might be expected.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 28 reports and 255 values; GM values were sand: 22 L  kg
–1, loam: 57 L  kg–1, 
clay: 95 L  kg–1 and organic: 110 L  kg–1. EMRAS also categorised the Kd for soil cation exchange 
capacity, but this was not a continuous progression.
/Twining et  al. 2004, Smith et  al. 2006, Wang and Staunton 2005, Fernandez et  al. 2006/ collectively 
reported another 7 values with an overall GM of 62 L  kg–1. Combining these 7 values with the NTE 
and Thibault et al. data sets (481 values) gives the equation:
Log (Kd) = 1.55 + 0.0160 · (clay)
with residual GSD of 7.4 and r2 = 0.07 and estimates for the SKB soils of 49, 290, 37, 95, 100, 91 
and 42 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.26 Tc – Technetium
No Kd values for Tc were measured in the SKB soils nor in the Canadian soils in the NTE program. 
The values from /Sheppard et al. 1990/ allow development of a regression for aerated values (soil pH 
was the only independent variable) and a single GM for anaerobic values (Table 5-24). These soils 
were predominantly organic. The residual GSD for aerated soils was 1.7 and the GSD for anaerobic soils was 4.4.

1 The statistical range included negative Kd values as the lower value: although statistically correct, a negative Kd is  
not physically possible, so zero is reported here.50/EMRAS 2008/ found 4 reports with 33 values of Kd, GM values were sand: 0.04 L  kg–1, 
loam: 0.07 L  kg–1, clay: 0.09 L  kg–1 and organic: 3.1 L  kg–1. /Echevarria et al. 2003/ reported  
Kd values ranging from 0.013 to 0.039 L  kg–1 for 5 aerobic soils.
The Kd values reported by /Thibault et al. 1990/, excluding those of /Sheppard et al. 1990/, did not vary 
significantly with the independent variables, so the GM from those values of 3.3 is the appropriate summarization. In general, redox is the most important determinant of Kd for Tc, under aerated conditions 
the value is probably as low as can be measured regardless of soil type. Using all the data of /Thibault 
et al. 1990/ including the data for aerated soils from /Sheppard et al. 1990/, there was no statistically significant relationship to soil properties. It is proposed to use a constant:
the overall GM for aerated soils was 3.1 L  kg
–1 with a GSD of 5.8.
From /Sheppard et al. 1990/:
the overall GM for anaerobic soils was 65 L  kg–1 with a GSD of 4.4.
5.3.27 Th – Thorium
The Kd values for Th were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 198 Canadian soils in the NTE 
program (Table 5-25). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included only pH, with a residual 
GSD of 3.4. The stepwise regression of the /Thibault et al. 1990/ data (23 values) included only pH, 
with a residual GSD of 15.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 8 reports with 46 values of Kd, GM values were sand: 700 L  kg–1, 
loam: 18,000 L  kg–1, clay: 4,500 L  kg–1 and organic: 730 L  kg–1. /Gooddy et al. 1995/ reported  
12 Kd values based on indigenous Th in acidic sandy soils, with a GM of 3,700 L  kg–1.
Combining the NTE and Thibault et al. data sets, along with data from /Sheppard and Hawkins 
1991/ provided 39 values and the equation:
Log (Kd) = 1.90 + 0.346 · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 11 and r2 = 0.16 and estimates for the SKB soils of 14,000, 1,300, 4,300, 
4,300, 1,900, 4,300 and 6,400 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.28 Tm – Thulium
The Kd values for Tm were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 87 Canadian soils in the NTE pro -
gram (Table  5-26). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included pH, sand, silt and the clay*pH 
interaction, with a residual GSD of 3.6. /IAEA 1994/ did not estimate a Kd for Tm, and /EMRAS 
2008/ proposed the value 330 L  kg–1 based on one measurement.

the NTE data set is proposed:
Log (Kd) = 5.656 + 0.524 · (pH) – 0.0464 · (sand) – 0.0496 · (silt) – 0.00841 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 3.6 and r2 = 0.29. This gives values for the SKB soils of 17,000, 5,400, 
4,000, 3,500, 2,200, 4,000 and 6,400 L  kg–1, respectively.
5.3.29 U – Uranium
The Kd values for U were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 209 Canadian soils in the NTE pro -
gram (Table 5-27). As noted in the review by /Sheppard et al. 2006/, Kd for U showed two different 
populations of data that responded differently to soil properties, divided by pH at about 5.5. Above 
a pH of 5.5, U tends to be solubilised by carbonate complexes, and so Kd decreases with pH above 5.5. Two stepwise regressions were developed. In addition, there were no NTE soils with pH > 5.5 and organic carbon > 20%. Simple stepwise regression included organic carbon as an independent 
variable, but because of a skew in this variable at high pH the predictions were spurious. Thus organic 
carbon was purposefully eliminated from the regression.
The stepwise regression of the NTE soil pH > 5.5 (182 soils) included pH, and clay, with a residual 
GSD of 4.2. Below pH 5.5 (30 soils), there was no significant equation and the GM was 3,200 L  kg
–1, 
GSD  3.2. The data from the review by /Sheppard et  al. 2006/ and references therein, which includes 
almost all the data from /Thibault et al. 1990/, was also handled in two regressions. For soils pH 
> 5.5 (123 soils), pH, organic carbon and the clay*pH interaction were included, with a residual GSD of 9.8. For soils pH < 5.5 (24 soils), only soil pH was included with a residual GSD of 11. /Vandenhove et  al. 2007/ gave Kd values for 18 quite different mineral soils (24 soils, all low 
organic carbon), and the stepwise regression included pH and organic carbon, with a residual GSD of 2.3. From /Thibault et al. 1990/, with 46 values, there was no relationship to soil properties and the GM was 120 with a GSD of 33.
/EMRAS 2008/ found 22 reports with 178 values of Kd. GM values were sand: 110 L  kg
–1, 
loam: 310 L  kg–1, clay: 28 L  kg–1 and organic: 1,200 L  kg–1. EMRAS did note that Kd varied with  
pH and estimated Kd values as pH < 3: 71 L  kg–1, 5 < pH < 7: 740 L  kg–1 and pH > 7: 65 L  kg–1.
Because there did not seem to be a consistent difference among the NTE, OPG and other data sets, 
they were combined. The resulting regression for soils pH > 5.5 (318 soils) and excluding organic 
carbon was:
Log (Kd) = 9.05 – 0.989 · (pH) + 0.00290 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 6.6 and r2 = 0.44. This gave predictions for the SKB sites A, C, D, F and G of 
610, 2,000, 31,000, 28,000 and 4,900 L  kg–1, respectively.
The regression for soils pH < 5.5 (32 soils) was:log (Kd) = 1.79 + 0.0152 · (clay) · (pH)Table 5‑26.  Measured (SKB) and predicted (using the NTE data set) Kd values (L kg‑1) for Tm.

1 Because the regressions were specific to pH, estimates in brackets are for SKB sites where pH is within 1 unit of the range of the regression, an d estimates are 
not shown if the pH of the site is more than 1 unit outside the range of the regression.
2 The data of /Vandenhove et al. 2007/ had few high organic carbon soils, the extrapolated values seemed spurious  
(> 106 L kg–1) and so are not shown.53with a residual GSD of 9.4 and r2 = 0.22. This gave predictions for the SKB sites A through G 
of 470, 65,000, 73, 6,800, 2,700, 4,000 and 160 L  kg–1, respectively. These values do not agree 
well with those observed for the SKB soils. Clearly Kd for acidic organic soils is not well known. 
The combined data and the corresponding regression lines (clay = 15%) versus pH are shown in 
Figure 5-9. The combined data and the corresponding regression lines (pH = 5.5 and pH = 8.5) versus clay content are shown in Figure 5-10.
5.3.30 Yb – Ytterbium
The Kd values for Yb were measured in the 7 SKB soils and in 203 Canadian soils in the NTE pro -
gram (Table  5-28). The stepwise regression of the NTE soil included pH, clay, sand and silt contents, 
with a residual GSD of 3.2. Neither /IAEA 1994/ nor /EMRAS 2008/ proposed Kd values for Yb.
Based on the NTE data set, the regression is:Log (Kd) = 4.29 + 0.320 · (pH) – 0.017 · (sand) – 0.0194 · (silt) – 0.0041 · (clay) · (pH)
with a residual GSD of 3.2 and r

14,000, 8,600, 5,700, 9,200 and 18,000 L  kg–1, respectively.

Values of Kd have substantial inherent variation, a typical GSD is about 3 to 5, which implies a 95th 
percentile confidence range of about 80-fold to 600-fold. These ranges apply to situations where 
some attributes of the soil are known: variation on generic values is usually larger. As such, many 
efforts to obtain site-specific values are potentially misleading; differences in Kd of less than 10-fold are seldom meaningful. Nonetheless, developing statistically valid relationships to predict Kd values for specific soils is important, as long as the overall level of uncertainty is not forgotten.
In this report, we developed regression equations to predict Kd based on soil pH, clay content and 
organic carbon content – reporting only equations and independent variables that were statistically 
significant. Simultaneous to this work, the EMRAS organization has proposed revised soil Kd values 
that will be published as an IAEA Technical Document. These values are plotted (Figure 5-11), con -
trasting the estimates from our regressions versus EMRAS estimates to correspond to a specific acidic 
sandy soil at one of the SKB sites. Each point is a different element. Deviation of more than 10-fold is 
evident, and in general the estimates here are higher than those from EMRAS.Table 5‑28.  Measured (SKB) and predicted (using the NTE data set) Kd values (L kg‑1) for Yb.

log(Kd) from EMRAS for sand55The independent variable most often found to significantly affect Kd was soil pH. The effect of pH 
on Kd for all the elements considered is shown in Figure 5-12. For most elements, the effect of a 
change in pH from 4 to 7 has less than a 20-fold effect, with higher Kd at higher pH. This level of 
effect is comparable to the random error in Kd values, and in many site-specific assessments there would not be such a broad range in soil pH. Several elements were not affected by pH, and Kd values for Mo, Sb, U and Tc decreased at higher pH. Note that for U, there are separate relationships for Kd 
above and below pH 5.5, and as developed they do not converge to the same Kd at pH 5.5 (this is 
considered a statistical feature, not a mechanistic discontinuity).

Tc56An interesting implication of the general effect of pH is that the environmental fates of most of these 
elements will co-vary with changes in pH. For example, in acidic soils, many of these elements will 
be more readily leached and probably more readily absorbed by plants. /Sheppard and Sheppard 1988/ 
explored the effect of soil acidification (acid rain) on dose with emphasis on Ra, in fact there would be an effect on dose from many of these elements. The change in combined dose with change in soil pH would be interesting.

literature aquatic Kd values
6.1 Introduction
Where soil Kd values differed to some extent among soil types, aquatic Kd values potentially differ 
between freshwater and marine, and between bottom sediment and suspended sediment. As with soil 
Kd, there may be differences in Kd depending on measurement method, which includes potential 
differences among data for stable elements versus their radioactive isotopes.
6.1.1 General methods
We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the Kd values of the 28 elements of interest to SKB, specifically within aquatic environments. We examined > 130 peer-reviewed articles, of which  
only a few were reviews or compendia of other works. We also made use of industry documents,  
as appropriate.
Our literature review covered as wide a range of source material as possible. Essentially, we conducted 
a stratified search of the literature where the strata were target element and type of aquatic environment. 
Overall, the literature revealed that research has been conducted in three main aquatic environments: 
marine, freshwater (usually lotic), and mixed – especially estuarine – systems. We obtained a range of publications representative of the field and experimental conditions under which Kd values have been reported. As such, this review has produced a solid representation of global Kd values for most 
of the target elements. Global Kd values were calculated from this pool of values and are presented 
along with values from /IAEA 1985, 2004/ and /EMRAS 2008/ and Kd values derived from information from the coastal area of eastern Sweden as measured by SKB.
Sediment Kd values are neither consistently defined nor reported within the literature. However, the 
most common definition and formula for Kd can be found in /Turner et  al. 1992/, and is consistent with 
our usage throughout this report. We report Kd values in the most common units of L  kg
–1, but confusion 
arises because many papers report Kd as unitless, with the implied units of (mg kg–1 dry sediment)/
(mg kg–1 water). Given the variation in Kd, the assumption of 1 kg water = 1 L  water is sufficiently 
accurate even for saline water, and we used this assumption for such data.
6.1.2 Determining literature‑based Kd values
In most cases, Kd values were taken as reported in the literature. In a few cases, it was possible to interpolate or cautiously extrapolate values from literature that did not directly report Kd. Geometric 
means (GM) were used to summarize data within each study across replicates and across other factors 
that were not important to our overall objective. For example, time series samples at a given site would be considered one observation for this review, and a single GM would be recorded.
In some cases, both the minimum and maximum values from within a single literature source were 
entered into our master data set. In these circumstances, each value was used as a discrete data point from which the GM was later calculated. This approach maintains some measure of the variability 
found in the study. Another issue that arose was where authors reported only median values. With the 
assumption that Kd values are lognormally distributed (supported by the Central Limit Theorem and many empirical evaluations of the distribution of Kd), then median and GM should be similar and the medians were entered into our data set.
It was evident that some Kd values were based on many observations while others were based on 
relatively few. As a result, we decided to include as much information about number of observations 
as possible. Although it was not always possible to distinguish number of independent observations 
from the literature publications, we extracted > 220 estimates of Kd representing > 3,000 observations.58The number of observations for each Kd value, N (shown in Table 6-1) is reported at two levels: 
1) the number of literature sources (publications) used to obtain the Kd data; and 2) the sum of the 
numbers of underlying observations within the literature sources. The second usually were comparatively 
large numbers and some of these were uncertain because of lack of clarity in the publications. In some cases, it appeared that results within a study were based on multiple observations, but some of these  
multiple observations may not have been truly independent observations. In other circumstances, 
extensive cross referencing revealed that the same data were used in more than one publication. However, 
we provide this number of apparent underlying observations as a gauge of the robustness of the data.
Although Kd values have been reported for various elements in a variety of aqueous environments, 
including estuaries, oceans, thermal vents and wetlands, we reduced the categorisation of our data into two broad groups of water: fresh and saline. The latter includes both estuaries and oceanic environ-
ments. While estuaries are generally less saline than oceans, they are usually only moderately so. The 
out-flowing riverine fresh water will generally lead to only limited dilution of the receiving salt water 
in the energetic tidal bays. It appears that estuaries were often sampled because they represented end- points for fluvial systems and therefore they offer the comparatively high concentrations of trace elements 
necessary for conducting the research.

300,000 IAEA 0459The Kd values were also reported for a variety of isotopes and chemical species. Information about 
isotope and chemical species was retained in the master data set. However, at present Kd values of 
all species and isotopes of an element were treated as those of the element. We anticipate that future 
work could be done to seek finer resolution in Kd values by examining Kd values for each of the chemical species of each element under a full suite of environmental conditions.
6.1.3 IAEA and EMRAS Kd values
We offer for comparative purposes, the marine pelagic and coastal Kd values reported by /IAEA 1985, 2004/ and freshwater suspended sediment values in the draft report obtained from the EMRAS program 
/EMRAS 2008/. /EMRAS 2008/ will in future be assigned an IAEA Technical Report Series number.
6.1.4 Determining SKB Kd values
In theory, Kd values could be considered site specific because they are empirical and depend upon 
many environmental (and methodological) variables. For example /Comber et al. 1995/ reported 
differences in Kd by an order of magnitude from two proximate English rivers – the Mersey which 
drains the northwest and the Humber which drains the northeast. Thus, site-specific Kd values may be quite different from the global values for any element.Table 6‑1 Continued.

Yb 350,000 Lit. 1 12 F 200,000 IAEA 0460We calculated site-specific Kd values for the Swedish east coastal area, based on data produced by 
SKB (the appendices in /Engdahl et al. 2008/ and from /Kumblad and Bradshaw 2008/. The Kd 
values for 23 of the 27 target elements were calculated for freshwater and marine benthic (bottom) 
sediments for both the Forsmark and Oskarshamn (Simpevarp) locations. The Kd values were also determined for suspended particulate matter (SPM) for both marine and freshwater systems, again for both Forsmark and Oskarshamn.
Benthic sediment Kd values were computed from /Engdahl et al. 2008/ for Forsmark as the concent-
ration of filtered sediment (dry-weight basis, their Appendix 9) divided by the corresponding pore 
water concentrations (their Appendix 11), with appropriate unit conversions. For the Oskarsham site  
it was concentration of filtered sediment (dry -weight basis, their Appendix  12) divided by pore water 
concentrations (their Appendix 14).
Values of Kd for suspended sediment (suspended particulate matter – SPM) for Forsmark used the 
total elemental content of the sediment and filter (their Appendix 1) less the blank for this type of 
filter along with any chemi-sorbed element (their Appendix 2), all divided by the corresponding 
water concentrations (their Appendix 4). The corresponding values for Oskarsham involved their Appendices 5, 6 and 8. The Kd values from the study by /Kumblad and Bradshaw 2008/ were tabulated by the authors, and were converted to units of L  kg
–1 for this report.
All of the SKB Kd values were combined into one data set, and log-transformed for statistical analysis. Each study had different numbers of sampling locations and other factors, resulting in an imbalanced design for statistical interpretation. The objective of the statistical interpretation 
was to provide a systematic means to determine which factors could be averaged and which 
required specific consideration. This was done with analysis of variance (ANOV A) of each element separately, following a stepwise analysis plan to deal with the imbalance. The first series of ANOV A were completely randomized designs with only one factor specified in each ANOV A. The factors, 
considered in separate ANOV A for each factor and each element, were water type (fresh versus 
marine), sediment type (benthic versus suspended), study (/Engdahl et al. 2008/ versus /Kumblad and Bradshaw 2008/), site (Forsmark versus Oskarsham) or sediment depth (3 depths were given  
by /Kumblad and Bradshaw 2008/).
The factors study, site and sediment depth were statistically significant for only 1 or 2 elements, 
whereas sediment type was statistically significant for almost all elements. The effects of water 
type were intermediate. It was decided that this was sufficient justification to attribute differences 
between sites, studies and sediment depth as statistical error, where the statistical objective was to characterize Kd for sites along the eastern coast. This improved the balance of the statistical design, so the next series of ANOV A were two-way factorials of water and sediment types along with the 
two-way interaction of these factors.
For several elements, the two-way interaction was significant, implying that to properly represent the 
data, it was necessary to derive values for both water types and both sediment types. As a result, the 
tables of values show four Kd values for each element. Clearly, the four values are not statistically 
different for all elements, but they are for some elements. The residual variance (the error term) from the ANOV A was used to compute a residual GSD. The interpretation of this GSD is the unexplained 
variance after accounting for the effects of water type and sediment type.
6.2 Results
The Kd values obtained from the literature and from /EMRAS 2008/ and /IAEA 1985, 2004/ are shown 
in Table  6-1, and references from the literature are shown in Tables  6-2 and 6-3. More detailed comparison 
of these values and estimates of variation are given in later tables, the most revealing information from Table  6-1 is the numbers of observations supporting each value and the differences between field in  situ 
values and values obtained from sorption and desorption experiments. In general, most of these values 
are supported by substantial numbers of both reports and individual observations. Among the /EMRAS 
2008/ data, the in situ values were lower than the experimental values except for Pu and Sr.61The comparison of /EMRAS 2008/ values to the literature is best illustrated by Figure 6-1. In general,  
the two sources agreed within a factor of 10, with the exception of Fe. The Kd for Fe may be responsive 
to redox conditions, and this may account for the difference between the sources. The grey lines in 
Figure  6-1 are 2 GSD above and below the 1:1  line, using the median GSD across elements to give an 
approximation of 95th percentile confidence bounds. Thus, if there are sufficient numbers of observations, 
only elements outside the grey lines would be cases where the EMRAS and literature data were statistically 
different. The results indicate that the two sources of data were not different, which is expected because 
both may have drawn on some of the same primary literature.
The freshwater Kd values for the SKB sites are shown in Table 6-4 along with the corresponding 
/EMRAS 2008/ and literature values. Note that the residual GSD for the SKB sites is almost always 
lower than the GSD from the literature, and this makes sense because the residual GSD reflects variation among sampling locations that are relatively close together and where consistent analytical methods 
were applied. The GSD from the literature includes variation among globally dispersed sites and among 
laboratories and measurement methods. The extreme GSD values (above ~12) from the literature probably should not be used for stochastic assessment, as it is not clear what portion of that variance  
is the result of methodological issues or unusual site characteristics.Table 6‑2.  Literature used to determine Kd values for freshwater sediment, both suspended and 
benthic.

Yb 350,000 /Weltje et al. 2002/62The comparison of SKB values to the literature is most easily seen in Figure 6-2. Although some 
values deviate from the 1:1 line by more than a factor of 10, they generally are symmetrical about 
the 1:1 line and within the approximate 95th percentile confidence bounds indicated by the grey lines. 
This suggests that the Kd values for SKB sites belong in the same data population as the literature, suggesting that literature values are applicable to the SKB sites. Values of Kd above 10,000 L  kg
–1 
indicate strong particle reactivity, and accuracy on values this large is probably not very important in risk assessment. Accuracy is important for lower Kd values, and in this case these largest discrepan -
cies for low-Kd elements are for I and Cl, and possibly for Se, Mn and Ni.
The comparison of Kd values for benthic sediment versus suspended particulate matter is illustrated 
in Figure 6-3. The ANOV A described earlier indicated that for many elements there was a significant difference between these sets of values, with benthic Kd values generally lower than suspended sediment Kd values. This was especially the case for I and Mn. The suspended particulate matter 
includes living and recently living organisms, whereas the benthic sediment will typically have more 
mineral matter and more aged organic matter.

The suspended material, if more organic, will have a lower particle density (mass per unit volume), 
and may, because it has remained suspended, be of smaller particle size. Thus it will have a higher 
specific surface area (surface area when hydrated per unit mass when dry). This will tend to result 
in higher Kd values. Iodine may be especially affected because algae will accumulate I. Another attribute of the suspended sediment versus the benthic sediment is redox: the benthic sediment may have lower redox potential, and this may explain the large difference seen for Mn. Manganese is 
relatively insoluble (high apparent
3 Kd) in aerated environments and relatively soluble (low apparent 
Kd) is reducing environments.
The marine Kd values for the SKB sites are shown in Table 6-5 along with the corresponding /IAEA 
1985/ and literature values. Note that the residual GSD for the SKB sites is again often lower than 
the GSD from the literature. The comparison of SKB values to the literature is most easily seen in 
Figure 6-4. Again, some values deviate from the 1:1 line by more than a factor of 10, but generally they are symmetrical about the 1:1 line.
3 The word ‘apparent’ is used because Kd in theory implies an exchange reaction, for Mn and many other 
elements, chemical precipitation or occlusion may be the actual retention mechanism involved.64Table 6‑4.  Freshwater sediment Kd values (L  kg–1) as measured in benthic and suspended par‑
ticulate matter at the SKB sites and from the /EMRAS 2008/ and literature sources. The residual 
geometric standard deviation (GSD) is the residual following ANOVA (see text), and so reflects variation among the SKB sampling locations. The literature GSD is among all entries obtained from the literature, and so reflects global site‑to‑site and study‑to‑study variation.

a The median GSD of SKB data was 2.5 and for literature data was 6.4.65There are several points about 2 GSD from the 1:1 line, but these had GSD higher than the median 
GSD used to draw the grey lines in Figure 6-4. Thus even for these elements, one can argue the Kd 
values for SKB sites belong in the same data population as the literature, suggesting that literature 
values are applicable to the SKB sites. Fortunately, among the low Kd values that are important to risk assessment, there is better agreement. As with the freshwater Kd values, the marine benthic Kd 
values tend to be lower than the corresponding suspended sediment values (Figure 6-5).
6.3 Selection of values for use in risk assessment
In general, given the inherent variability in sediment Kd values, the differences among the sources 
of data were not statistically meaningful. Data specific to the SKB sites were not different, overall, 
from the global literature. One could justifiably draw Kd values for use in risk assessment from any 
one of these sources, or from them all collectively. For a few elements, notably Cl, the number of observations from the SKB sites is comparable to the numbers of observations supporting the values derived from the global literature. However, for most elements there are many more observations in 
the global literature than from the SKB sites, which suggests the global literature should be used.Table 6‑5.  Marine sediment Kd values (L  kg–1) as measured in benthic and suspended particulate 
matter at the SKB sites and from the /IAEA 1985/ and literature sources. The residual geometric 
standard deviation (GSD) is the residual following ANOVA (see text), and so reflects variation among the SKB sampling locations. The literature GSD is among all entries obtained from the literature, and so reflects global site‑to‑site and study‑to‑study variation.

Literature sediment Kd (L/kg)SKB benthic sediment Kd (L/kg)67In addition to numbers of samples, the global literature represents a broader range of conditions, not 
only spatially but in terms of water movement (tides, currents and fluvial inputs), water chemistry 
and water -column flora and fauna. The present situation for these conditions along the eastern coast 
of Sweden may change with time, so there is merit in considering the global literature as a sampling 
of possible future states. This argument is relevant for the GM values, but even more importantly for the GSD that would be used in a stochastic risk assessment. As described above, the GSD for 
the SKB sites may be too small to encompass the full spatial variation intended, and very likely too 
small to represent any temporal effects. In contrast, the literature GSD values may encompass too 
many uncertainties, such as measurement methods.
Key advantages of the SKB data are the consistent measurement methods and the clear differentiation 
in values between Kd for benthic sediments and suspended particulate matter. It is also important to note that the SKB freshwater Kd values for I and Cl, and perhaps also for Se, Mn and Ni, were in 
the value range where Kd is important to risk assessment and deviated to some extent from the corre -
sponding global literature. These elements may need special attention, and perhaps more detailed study.
Given these arguments, it may be appropriate to use the SKB data for risk assessment of sites on the 
east coast of Sweden, when available. For elements where freshwater SKB data are not available, the /EMRAS 2008/ values for freshwater have the advantage of promulgation by the IAEA, and would therefore be the next best choice. For elements where marine SKB data are not available, the 
literature reviewed here may be a better choice than /IAEA 1985, 2004/, where Kd were not necessarily 
derived from paired water and sediment samples.Figure 6‑5. Marine sediment Kd values, comparing benthic Kd values from the SKB sites with suspended

SKB suspended sediment Kd (L/kg)SKB benthic sediment Kd (L/kg)697 Overall conclusions
It is possible to select values of Kd for soils and sediments that are the best estimates from the data 
available, and to show that these values would differ in a statistically significant manner as site conditions 
differed. For example, the soil Kd values for U varied notably with pH, and so if soil pH varied from 
site to site, or with time because of natural processes or human activities, then it is possible to assign revised best estimate Kd values for the changed soil pH. However, it is important to bear in mind the overall variability of Kd data.
Among the regression equations to predict soil Kd values, the median residual GSD was 4.3, which 
implies 95
th percentile confidence bounds 18-fold above and below the recommended values. The 5th 
percentile and 95th percentile values are more than 300-fold different from each other. This is clearly 
a large enough variance to move some elements from what might be deemed an ‘immobile’ category 
into a category that might be deemed ‘very mobile’, or vice versa. In many respects, the best that can 
be said of Kd is that it can differentiate the extremely mobile elements such as Cl from the extremely immobile elements such as Pb and Th. However, this does not imply a fault with Kd as a model of sorption, but rather that many variables, both known and unknown, have a strong influence.
For the sediment Kd values, the median GSD for data measured at the SKB sites was only 2.5, but from 
the literature the median was 6.4 or 8.6 (Tables 6.1 and 6.4). This implies 95
th percentile confidence 
bounds for marine Kd as high as 74-fold above and below the recommended values (for freshwater 
Kd they are 41-fold). As discussed by /Sheppard 2005b/, there is an asymptotic minimum variation 
in Kd, further specification of environmental conditions will not substantially lessen this variation. Therefore, it is important to account for variation in an assessment application.718 References
