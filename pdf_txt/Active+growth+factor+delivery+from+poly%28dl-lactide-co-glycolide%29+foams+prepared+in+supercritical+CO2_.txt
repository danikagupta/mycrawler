The aim of this study was to prepare poly- DL-lactide/polyethylene glycol (P DLLA/PEG) blends to improve
medium absorption and cell proliferation in the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of their scaffolds. Car-
bon dioxide (CO 2) was used as a foaming agent to create porosity in these blends. The results of Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy demonstrated that the blends were homogeneous mixtures of
PDLLA and PEG. The peak shifts at 1092 and 1744 cm/C01conﬁrmed the presence of molecular interactions
between these two compounds. Increasing the PEG weight ratio enhanced the relative crystallinity andhydrophilicity. The P
DLLA/PEG blends (especially 80/20 and 70/30 weight ratios) exhibited linear degra-
dation proﬁles over an incubation time of 8 weeks. The mechanical properties of P DLLA/PEG blends having
less than 30 wt.% PEG were suitable for the fabrication of porous scaffolds. Increasing the concentration of
PEG to above 50% resulted in blends that were brittle and had low mechanical integrity. Highly porousscaffolds with controllable pore size were produced for 30 wt.% PEG samples using the gas foaming tech-
nique at temperatures between 25 and 55 /C176C and pressures between 60 and 160 bar. The average pore
diameters achieved by gas foaming process were between 15 and 150
lm, and had an average porosity
of 84%. The medium uptake and degradation rate of fabricated P DLLA/PEG scaffolds were increased com-
pared with neat P DLLA ﬁlm due to the presence of PEG and porosity. The porous scaffolds also demon-
strated a lower modulus of elasticity and a higher elongation at break compared to the non-porousﬁlm. The fabricated P
DLLA/PEG scaffolds have high potential for various tissue-engineering applications.

1. Introduction
Poly- DL-lactide (P DLLA) has been widely used for the fabrication
of three-dimensional (3-D) scaffolds due to its superior mechanical
properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability [1–3] . However,
the hydrophobicity of P DLLA results in poor medium uptake and
subsequently limited cellular activities [1]. The hydrophobic sur-
face also leads to protein adsorption from the blood when the scaf-
fold is used in vivo, which causes side effects [2]. Blending P DLLA
with a polymer such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) may enhance
its hydrophilic properties [1,3–10] .PDLLA/PEG blends acquire prop-
erties that cannot be found in individual polymers [11,12] .
Copolymerization has been used to prepare various P DLLA/PEG
blends; the copolymer properties are functions of their composi-
tions and the molecular weights of each monomer [5,13] . Saito
et al. [5]produced P DLLA/PEG copolymers for the delivery of bone
morphogenetic proteins and the induction of bone formation.
The copolymers exhibited a desirable balance between degrada-
tion rate and hydrophilicity, and induced the ectopic formationof new bone when evaluated in vivo [5]. An alternative approach
is to prepare physical mixtures of these polymers by solvent cast-
ing using a solvent that dissolves both polymers [1,9] or emulsion/
solvent evaporation using two immiscible solvents, such as water
and dichloromethane (DCM) [4].
Porous scaffolds are produced using techniques such as elec-
trospinning [9,14] and freeze drying [1]based on homogeneous
blends of two components. Cui et al. [9]used electrospining and
prepared a ﬁlm by processing a mixture of P DLLA and PEG (0–
50 wt.% PEG) in acetone/DCM (3/1 by vol.). A homogeneous mix-
ture with pore sizes between 5 and 10 lm was fabricated by this
method. The two-dimensional structure of this scaffold and the
small pore sizes created by this method were hurdles for applica-
tions such as cell proliferation in 3-D structure [9]. Maquet et al.
[1]improved the hydrophilicity of P DLLA foams by adding amphi-
philic block copolymers of lactide and ethylene oxide (PELA). The
porous P DLLA/PELA foams were prepared by freeze drying the solu-
tions in dioxane and chloroform. It was found that the degradation
and wettability of the resultant foams were signiﬁcantly increased
when a PELA concentration of 10 wt.% was used. The fabricatedblend foams using a 10 wt.% PELA contained both micropores
(10
lm) and macropores (100 lm)[1]. The P DLLA/PELA foams

fabricated by freeze drying promoted cellular migration, angiogen-
esis, and axonal growth when implanted in rat spinal cord. How-
ever, this technique is energy intensive and there is no control
on porous structures. Previous studies demonstrate that the opti-
mal pore size is between 20 and 125 lm for regeneration of
adult mammalian skin [15],2 0lm for hepatocytes ingrowth,
40–100 lm for osteoid ingrowth and 100–350 lm for bone regen-
eration [16]. The development of a process that can tailor pore
characteristics is desirable for the fabrication of scaffolds for broad
range of biomedical applications.
1.1. Gas foaming
The gas foaming technique utilizes the nucleation and growth
of gas bubbles dispersed into a viscous polymer solution for the
creation of porosity [17]. The gas bubbles can be formed by a blow-
ing agent via chemical reactions [18]. The foaming agent can also
be released from a presaturated gas-polymer mixture [17].A
supercritical ﬂuid, i.e. a ﬂuid above its critical point, can be efﬁcient
in forming this gas-saturated polymer phase due to its superior
mass transfer properties, zero surface tension and adjustable den-
sity by the variation of temperature and pressure [19]. Carbon
dioxide is commonly used as a supercritical ﬂuid because of its
non-ﬂammability, non-toxicity and moderate critical point
(31.1 /C176C and 73.8 bar). Supercritical CO 2has been used to generate
porosity in amorphous and semi-crystalline polymers such as
PDLLA, poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid), poly( e-caprolactone) (PCL)
and polystyrene [17,20–27] . Subcritical CO 2(i.e. liquid CO 2near
its critical point) has also been used for the creation of porosity
in polymers. For example, Mooney et al. [28] fabricated porous
poly( D, L-lactic- co-glycolic acid) scaffolds at 55 bar and tempera-
tures between 20 and 23 /C176C. However, the use of subcritical CO 2
may require a longer processing time to achieve gas saturation in
polymers due to the lower mass transfer properties compared with
supercritical conditions [29].
Gas foaming by supercritical or subcritical CO 2generally in-
volves two stages for the creation of a 3-D porous structure: (i)
the formation of a gas-saturated polymer phase (the pressurization
stage) and (ii) pore nucleation, growth and coalescence (the
depressurization stage) [19,27,30–32] . Exposure of these polymers
to high-pressure CO 2leads to plasticization, and subsequently en-
hances the CO 2solubility and diffusivity in these matrices. For
example, the glass transition temperature of P DLLA was decreased
from 55 to 35 /C176C when using CO 2at 68 bar [33]. Upon depressur-
ization and the consequent remarkable drop in CO 2solubility in
the polymers, supersaturation occurs and the nuclei of gas mole-
cules clusters are formed, which then grow and create a porousstructure upon vitriﬁcation [28,34,35] . The operating variables,
such as pressure, temperature and depressurization rate, have sig-
niﬁcant impacts on the pore characteristics, such as pore size and
interconnectivity [21]. Howdle and co-workers [36,37] produced
porous P
DLLA scaffolds with controllable pore diameter and poros-
ity using high-pressure CO 2. The average pore diameters ranged
from 100 to 250 lm, with porosities over 70%.
PEG is able to absorb a large amount of CO 2. Weidner and co-
workers [38] measured CO 2solubility in PEG of different molecular
weights (1.5–35 kDa) between 43 and 100 /C176C and 5 and 300 bar.
Their study shows that CO 2absorption into PEG is enhanced by
increasing pressure and decreasing temperature. The maximum
CO2solubility in the PEG (MW = 4000) was 30 wt.% (CO 2weight ra-
tio in polymer phase) at 55 /C176C and 300 bar [38]. It was found that
the molecular weight of PEG had a negligible effect on CO 2solubil-
ity in the polymer phase [38,39] . These results endorse the great
potential of gas foaming technique using sub- or supercritical
CO2for the creation of porosity in P DLLA/PEG blends.Gas foaming is a relatively rapid and solvent-free process that
can operate at moderate temperatures [17]. The process also en-
ables in situ impregnation of active compounds, such as DNA and
bone morphogenic protein-2, within the polymers, and the subse-
quent release of these compounds upon the diffusion and degrada-
tion of polymer [36,37] .
The aims of this study were to: (i) prepare blends of P DLLA/PEG
with optimized properties; and (ii) investigate the feasibility of
using the gas foaming process to control pore characteristics of
the optimized blends. The effect of PEG weight ratio on the relative
crystallinity, hydrophilicity, medium uptake, degradation rate and
mechanical strength of blends was ﬁrst studied. The conditions for
the fabrication of porosity in P DLLA/PEG by gas foaming were deter-
mined. The effect of porosity on the properties of scaffolds was also
examined.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Poly( D, L-lactide) (P DLLA, 406 kDa) was purchased from PURAC,
Singapore. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, 10 kDa) was purchased from
Fluka, Australia. Dichloromethane (DCM, 99.5% purity) was pur-
chased from Merck, Australia. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH
7.2–7.4) was prepared by dissolving a PBS tablet (Sigma, Australia)
in MilliQ water (highly puriﬁed and deionized water, 18.2 M Xcm).
Food-grade CO 2(99.99% purity) was supplied by BOC, Australia.
2.2. Preparation of P DLLA/PEG blend
Different weight ratios of P DLLA and PEG (50/50, 70/30, 80/20,
90/10 and 100/0) were prepared in Schott bottles by dissolving
each mixture in DCM to obtain a 25 wt.% solution (the weight ratio
of the total polymer in the DCM). The solution was shaken at
170 rpm for 15 h at ambient temperature using a shaker (ASP Orbi-
tal). The homogeneous solution of each blend was poured onto a
non-sticky Teﬂon-coated mould (5 /C215 cm2), and kept in a desic-
cator under a slight vacuum for 2 days to allow DCM evaporation
and to produce an opaque blend ﬁlm.
2.3. The gas foaming process
A schematic diagram of the experimental set-up for the creation
of porosity in polymer blends by gas foaming is shown in Fig. 1 .
Brieﬂy, in each run, about 50 mg of the polymer sample was placed
in a high-pressure vessel (40 ml). The vessel was placed in a water
bath, the temperature was controlled by a recirculation heater
(Ratek TH5-2KW). After thermal equilibrium was attained at a de-
sired temperature (between 25 and 55 /C176C) and the air had been
purged, the system was pressurized with CO 2to a predetermined
pressure (between 60 and 160 bar) using a high-pressure pump
(ISCO Syringe pump, Model 500D). The vessel was then isolated,
kept under these conditions for 2 h, then depressurized at
10 bar min/C01. The depressurization rate was controlled using a
capillary tube (10 cm length and 127 lm inner diameter) that
was calibrated to the desired rate. After depressurization, the sam-
ple was collected for characterizations.
2.4. Characterizations
2.4.1. Attenuated total reﬂectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR–
FTIR) spectroscopy
The interaction between P DLLA and PEG was determined by
ATR–FTIR spectroscopy (Varian 660-IR). Each sample was directly
attached and stabilized on the diamond using ATR–FTIRC. Ji et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 8 (2012) 570–578 571accessories. The analysis was conducted using 4 cm/C01resolutions,
averaged for 32 scans over the range 600–2000 cm/C01.
2.4.2. Thermal properties
The thermal behaviours of fabricated scaffolds were investi-
gated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; TA Instrument
Q1000). Brieﬂy, each sample (3–8 mg) was carefully weighed in an
aluminium pan and covered with an aluminium lid. The DSC pro-
ﬁle of each sample was acquired from a heating run from 30 to
100/C176C at a rate of 10 /C176C min/C01under dry nitrogen atmosphere.
The relative crystallinity of each sample was deﬁned according to
weight fraction of PEG as the ratio of normalized fusion enthalpy
to that of pure PEG, which was considered to be 100% crystalline.
2.4.3. Water contact angle
The water contact angle on each ﬁlm was determined at room
temperature. A ﬁlm was placed on the top of a stainless steel base.
A drop of MilliQ water (1 ll) was added to the surface of ﬁlm, and
the image was taken by a built-in CCD camera after an elapsed
time of 30 s. The image was analysed by the built-in software of
a Rame-hart Instrument to obtain the water contact angle.2.4.4. Medium uptake
The medium uptake measurements were performed at 37 /C176Ci n
PBS. Each sample was weighed ( W0) and immersed in PBS over-
night (at least 12 h). Each sample was then removed and weighed
(Wt) after excessive medium (PBS) was carefully wiped off on the
surface of scaffold. The medium uptake ratio was then calculated
using the following equation:
Media uptake ratio ¼Wt/C0W0
W0ð1Þ
2.4.5. Degradation rate
The hydrolytic degradation proﬁles of fabricated scaffolds were
evaluated at 37 /C176C in PBS. Each sample was weighed ( W0) and im-
mersed in PBS. After a predetermined time interval (up to
8 weeks), the sample was rinsed in MilliQ water three times, and
weighed ( Wt) after drying. The degradation rate was then calcu-
lated using the following equation:

The tensile behaviours of fabricated scaffolds were measured
using a dynamic mechanical analyser (TA Instrument 2980). Each
sample was cut into a dumbbell shape (10 /C25/C21,
length /C2width /C2thickness in mm). The initial and extended sta-
tuses of the scaffold during DMA measurement are depicted in
Fig. 2 . The maximum design force of the equipment is 18 N; the
tests were conducted using a force rate of 4 N min/C01until sample
failure. The tension (mm) and stress (MPa) were recorded by the
built-in software, and the tensile modulus of each sample was
determined as the slope of the stress–strain curve in the linear re-
gion only. The linear regions varied from 5% to 20% for different
blends.
2.4.7. Residual solvent
The residue of DCM was measured using gas chromatography
(GC; Finnigan Polaris Q). Brieﬂy, each sample was placed in an am-
ber GC vial and heated up to 150 /C176C; solid-phase microextraction
ﬁber (100 lm, Supelco) was used for the headspace sampling,
and helium was the carrier gas. A 40 eV ionization energy was used
for this analysis. A calibration curve was obtained prior to the anal-
ysis to determine the correlation between the peak area and the
various amounts of DCM injected into the GC column. The solvent
residue in each sample was calculated using the calibration line.
2.4.8. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The porous structures of fabricated scaffolds were examined
using SEM (Philips XL30). Prior to SEM analysis, each sample was
frozen and fractured in liquid nitrogen. The cross-section of each
scaffold was mounted on a circular aluminium stub and sputter-
coated with gold. The equivalent circle diameters of pores
(nP300) were calculated using Image J software. Image J software
has been used to calculate the average pore diameter in a number
of previous studies [40–44] . The measurements were conducted
using at least ﬁve SEM images from different cross-sections of each
scaffold. The diameters of at least 300 pores were measured for
each condition to obtain a reliable data. Our previous results dem-
onstrated that the data obtained by this method are similar to
those achieved using microcomputerized tomography (micro CT;
Skyscan 1072) [45].
2.4.9. Porosity
The porosity of each processed sample was calculated using the
same dimensions as before and after high-pressure processing as
described in a previous study [28]. In our study, the scaffolds be-
fore and after gas foaming process kept a rectangular shape. Thus,
the dimension (length, width and thickness) of each scaffold can be
measured accurately using a digital calliper (JBS) ( n= 9). Due to po-
tential human error in the measurements, we considered p< 0.01
to be statistically signiﬁcant. The volume of scaffold could thus
be calculated, and the overall porosity ( e) was then estimated using
the following equation:

2.5. Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was determined for three replicates
(except where otherwise mentioned) by an independent Student’s
t-test for two groups of data or analysis of variance for multiple
comparisons using Modde™ 7.0 software (Umetrics). Data are rep-
resented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). A conﬁdence level of
95% ( p< 0.05) was considered as statistically signiﬁcant except
where otherwise mentioned.3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterizations of P DLLA/PEG ﬁlm
3.1.1. ATR–FTIR spectroscopy
The presence of each component in the blends was determined
using ATR–FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra of typical absorp-
tion peaks and the functional groups present in P DLLA and PEG
are shown in Fig. 3 . PEG exhibited a characteristic peak at
1092 cm/C01(Fig. 3 a), corresponding to C–O stretching [46]. The
characteristic peak of P DLLA located at 1744 cm/C01(Fig. 3 c) is attrib-
uted to the carbonyl (C @O) band [47,48] . Both peaks were ob-
served in the FTIR spectrum of P DLLA/PEG blend, which
corroborates the existence of both components in the blend. Peak
shifts were found for the ether group from P DLLA (from 1092 to
1084 cm/C01) and the carbonyl bond from PEG (from 1744 to
1750 cm/C01)(Fig. 3 b). These shifts conﬁrmed that there were inter-
actions between P DLLA and PEG, showing that these two compo-
nents can interact at the molecular level. PEG is miscible with
aqueous medium; no signiﬁcant difference was detected in the
FTIR spectrum based on blends before and after the immersion of
sample in water for a period of 24 h, indicating that the PEG still
remained in the blend after exposure to water.
3.1.2. Thermal properties
PDLLA is amorphous, with a glass transition temperature of
52/C176C. The addition of PEG, a crystalline polymer, led to a change
in the thermal properties of fabricated scaffold. As shown in
Fig. 4 , endothermic melting peaks can be seen on P DLLA/PEG
blends. The weight ratio of PEG had a negligible effect on the melt-
ing temperature ( /C2455/C176C). Increasing the PEG weight ratio resulted
in a greater intensity (peak area) of melting peak. We calculated
the relative crystallinity of each blend according to pure PEG. As
expected, by increasing the weight ratio of PEG from 10 to
50 wt.%, the relative crystallinity was enhanced (from 16% to
75%; Table 1 ).
3.1.3. Hydrophilicity
It is desirable to enhance the hydrophilic properties of a poly-
mer to promote cell adhesion and proliferation in scaffolds. The
use of P DLLA in tissue engineering is usually limited by its hydro-
phobicity [2].PDLLA can adsorb protein from the blood on its
hydrophobic surface, which subsequently causes undesirable side
effects, such as thrombus formation [49,50] . Blending P DLLA with
a polymer such as PEG may improve its hydrophilic properties,

angle of the hydrophilic PEG ﬁlm was 22.8 ± 2 /C176and that of pure
PDLLA ﬁlm was 159.6 ± 2 /C176, corroborating its hydrophobicity [52].
The water contact angle of 50/50 P DLLA/PEG blend was decreased
compared to neat P DLLA, to 53.5 ± 0.2 /C176(Table 1 ). The decrease in
water contact angle by increasing PEG weight ratio demonstrates
that the hydrophilicity of P DLLA was improved due to the addition
of PEG.
The medium uptake property of scaffolds facilitates cellular
nutrient supply and waste removal [53]. The medium uptake for
neat P DLLA ﬁlm was negligible; however, blending this polymer
with PEG enhances its capacity for medium uptake. The medium(PBS) uptake ratio of blends ranged from 11.4 ± 0.4 to 37.0 ± 2 as
the weight ratio of PEG was increased from 10 to 50 wt.% ( Table 1 ).
Maquet et al. [1]found a similar trend in freeze-dried P
DLLA/PEG
blend scaffolds; the increased PEG weight ratio resulted in im-
proved medium absorption capacity.
3.1.4. Degradation rate
PDLLA/PEG blends degrade due to hydrolysis of P DLLA and disso-
lution of PEG in aqueous medium. As shown in Fig. 5 , pure P DLLA
exhibited a slow degradation ratio (7.2 ± 0.5%) within 4 weeks,
while a dramatic increase was observed from week 6. Neat P DLLA
was degraded 58.4 ± 3% after week 8. The blends with 10 wt.%
PEG (90/10 blend) showed a similar degradation pattern to pure
PDLLA. The other blends (80/20, 70/30 and 50/50) exhibited differ-
ent degradation proﬁles compared to pure P DLLA ﬁlm: a greater
weight loss ratio (12.8 ± 0.1–31.5 ± 0.1%) occurred during the ﬁrst
week due to the partial dissolution of PEG, after which a linear deg-
radation rate was observed up to 8 weeks. The addition of PEG (10–
30 wt.%) reduced the degradation rate of P DLLA; this may be due tothe molecular interaction between these two components, as pre-
viously indicated. A short-term (3 h) degradation test was con-
ducted for P DLLA ﬁlms and P DLLA/PEG (50/50) blends. The results
showed that after 3 h the P DLLA ﬁlms had negligible weight loss,
whereas a weight loss of at least 5 wt.% was observed for the
PDLLA/PEG. This conﬁrms that PEG dissolution occurred at the early
stage of immersion in a medium.
3.1.5. Mechanical strength
Pure P DLLA ﬁlm is hard and tough, with a low elastic modulus
(26.7 ± 5 MPa) but a high elongation at break (73.7 ± 4%). The addi-
tion of PEG resulted in an enhanced elastic modulus, as shown in
Fig. 6 . The elastic modulus was increased to 70.0 ± 7 MPa when
the PEG weight ratio was raised to 30%. This phenomenon may
be attributed to the increased crystallinity [54]. We found a dra-
matic enhancement in the elastic modulus (205.2 ± 35 MPa) when
50 wt.% PEG was used. However, the elongation of break dropped
greatly (8.9 ± 4%), indicating that the 50/50 blend was more brittle.
No signiﬁcant effect on elongation of break was observed when the
PEG weight ratio was below 30%.
3.1.6. Solvent residue
The DCM residues in the ﬁlms were less than 10 ppm (mg DCM
per kg ﬁlm), which is below the United States Pharmacopeia (USP)
and the United States Food and Drug Administration acceptance
levels (600 and 150 ppm, respectively) [55,56] . These data demon-
strate that the drying procedure was efﬁcient at removing the or-
ganic solvent residue and that the fabricated 3-D porous scaffold

3.2. Fabrication of porous P DLLA/PEG 3-D scaffolds
PDLLA/PEG blends characterizations demonstrate that the 70/30
weight ratio of P DLLA/PEG exhibited optimum properties, such as
mechanical strength, medium uptake, degradation rate and hydro-
philicity. A porous P DLLA/PEG scaffold was thus prepared based on
this weight ratio using the gas foaming technique. Previous studies
demonstrate the plasticization (reduction of glass transition tem-
perature) of P DLLA[33] and melting point depression of PEG occurs
when using CO 2at pressures above 60 bar [57,58] due to the
interactions between these polymers and CO 2. Hence, the effectof pressure on pore characteristics was determined at pressures
above 60 bar. The blends exhibited a melting temperature of
55/C176C; therefore, the operating temperature was selected between
the ambient temperature of 25 /C176C and below the melting point of
blend to avoid melting and to maintain the shape of scaffold during
the gas foaming process.
Highly porous scaffolds were produced by gas foaming using
supercritical and subcritical CO 2, respectively ( Fig. 7 ). The pore size
ranged from 15.5 ± 2 to 150.2 ± 34 lm, as shown in Table 2 . The ef-

Fig. 8. Pore diameters of P DLLA/PEG (70/30) blends produced by gas foaming at
various temperatures and pressures.C. Ji et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 8 (2012) 570–578 575pore size was investigated. As shown in Fig. 8 , at subcritical tem-
perature (25 /C176C), the average pore diameter in P DLLA/PEG was
slightly smaller than the ones created under supercritical condi-
tions and the effect of pressure was less pronounced at this tem-
perature. At a subcritical pressure (60 bar), the pore size was
larger than the one formed under supercritical conditions. The
pores were also less uniform at subcritical conditions, which might
be due to the lower diffusivity of CO 2into the polymer under these
conditions: the processing time might not be adequate for uniform
distribution of CO 2into the polymer phase.
At a constant temperature, increasing pressure resulted in
decreasing pore size ( Fig. 8 ). This is in agreement with previous
studies [21,59,60] . The pore diameter of polystyrene scaffold de-
creased from 70 to 10 lm as the pressure was increased from
137 to 413 bar at 100 /C176C[59]. Higher pressure results in increased
solubility of CO 2within the polymer, which causes greater super-
saturation upon depressurization and subsequently higher gas
nucleation densities, thus smaller pores are created [21,59] .
At a constant pressure, elevating the temperature of gas foam-
ing process increased the pore diameter ( Fig. 8 ). Arora et al. [59]
observed similar behaviour when processing polystyrene with
gas foaming; the pore diameter was enhanced from 7 to 25 lm
as temperature was elevated from 60 to 120 /C176C. Increasing temper-
ature leads to decreasing CO 2density, thus reducing its solubility
in the polymer. However, raising the temperature enhances the
CO2diffusion and reduces the viscosity of polymer; both factors
are expected to increase the CO 2absorption and mobility into
the polymer phase in a certain period of time. The results acquired
for the effect of temperature show that density is the dominant
factor affecting the pore size for these systems [21,59] . At higher
temperatures the degree of supersaturation is reduced during the
depressurization stage as a result of decreasing CO 2solubility in
the polymer phase. Subsequently, lower numbers of gas nuclei
are formed in the polymer, which then grow due to the greater
CO2mobility and create larger pores.
The overall porosity of fabricated sample in this study at differ-
ent conditions was in average 84%. However, the difference be-
tween porosity of samples produced at different conditions was
negligible. The porosity of sample prepared at 45 /C176C and 120 bar
was also measured by the microCT technique using built-in soft-
ware (CT-An) based on a series of 3-D reconstructed images
(n= 150) ( Fig. 9 ). The result (79%) was comparable with the poros-
ity calculated by measuring the dimension change based on the
samples produced at the same condition (74–77%).
The formation of a skin layer on the surface of scaffolds is a
common problem in many processes used for the creation of
porosity in polymers [61]. We observed the formation of a skin
layer ( Fig. 9 ) in the gas foaming process. The skin layer is formed
due to rapid diffusion of CO 2near the surface, where the CO 2con-
centration is too low to create nucleation [61,62] . This layer cansimply be cut off to improve the mass transfer of nutrients and
oxygen transfer, and to promote cell inﬁltration in the 3-D
structure.
3.3. The effect of porosity on scaffold properties
The porous structure is expected to provide a larger contact sur-
face area between the medium and the scaffold, thereby improving
the medium uptake property. The non-porous P DLLA/PEG ﬁlm
exhibited a medium uptake of 35.6 ± 1%. The medium uptake of
the porous scaffolds (produced at 120 bar and 45 /C176C) was increased
twofold (73.0 ± 6%).
The hydrolysis of porous scaffolds is accelerated due to the in-
creased contact surface area between the material and the med-
ium. As shown in Fig. 10 , porous scaffold exhibited a faster
degradation proﬁle. The ultimate degradation ratio after week 8
for the porous scaffold produced at 120 bar and 45 /C176C was
70.9 ± 1%, compared with the non-porous scaffold, which showed
41.8 ± 2% degradation.
The pore size plays a signiﬁcant role in regulating the mechan-
ical behaviour of a scaffold [63]; the porous structure usually
makes the scaffold less elastic [64–69] . As shown in Fig. 11 , the
porous scaffolds fabricated at 120 bar and 45 /C176C exhibited a lower
elastic modulus than the non-porous ﬁlm (21.5 ± 2 vs.
70.0 ± 7 MPa). Yu et al. [70] found similar observations on PCL/
hydroxyapatite composite scaffolds. The elastic modulus of their
non-porous scaffolds was 130 MPa on average, while their porous
scaffold (75% porosity) exhibited a greatly declined elastic modulus
(5 MPa). A remarkable increase in elongation at break was detected

compared with 66.9 ± 10%). These data conﬁrm that porosity had
a positive impact on extensibility. Madihally and Matthew [65]
demonstrated that porous chitosan scaffolds exhibit higher elonga-
tion at break ( /C24110%) than non-porous equivalents (30–40%). Por-
ous scaffolds can be potentially applied in various tissue
engineering applications due to their reasonable elastic modulus
and elongation rate [71].
4. Conclusions
PDLLA and PEG were blended stably by solvent casting due to
their molecular interactions. The characteristics of blend can be
tailored using different weight ratios of two components. P DLLA/
PEG with a weight ratio of 70/30 exhibited the optimum proper-
ties. The gas foaming technique using supercritical and subcritical
CO2was efﬁcient in creating porosity in the blends and eliminated
the use of an organic solvent. This process allows the production of
3-D porous scaffolds and tailoring of the pore size by adjusting the
variables of the process. The average pore diameters ranged from
15 to 150 lm. Large size pores were produced at subcritical condi-
tions. The pore size had a signiﬁcant impact on the medium up-
take, degradation and mechanical properties of polymer. The
pore size of scaffolds can be tailored to suit various tissue engi-
neering applications.
