ADSORPTION OF CONGO RED DYE ON HAZELNUT SHELLS 
AND DEGRADATION WITH Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
 
Riccardo A. Carletto,  Fabiana Chimirri, Francesca Bosco,* and Franco Ferrero 
 
The present work concerns the expe rimental evaluation of hazelnut 
shells as a low cost natural biosorben t. Adsorption of the direct azo dye 
Congo Red was performed within a concentrations  range of 50-5000 mg/L. Hazelnut shells were employed as organic support for 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  cultures to study the best cultural medium 
composition for the MnP pr oduction. The capability of Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  to take macronutrients as carbon and nitrogen from 
hazelnut shells was demonstrated. Cultures of  Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  were carried out with hazelnut shells coming from Congo 
Red adsorption tests, showing t hat 43% of the adsorbed dye was 
degraded .

INTRODUCTION 
 
 Research about dye removal from industr ial effluents is r eceiving increasing 
attention as legislation is becoming more and more restrictive. More than 100,000 dyes 
are commercially available (Nigam et al. 2000) and more than 700,000 tons/year are 
produced in the world for the textile industry alone (Will et al. 2000). Most of these dyes 
are difficult to decolorize due to their stability, complex structure, and synthetic origin,  necessary characteristics due to the fact that they have to be fast upon exposure to sweat, 
light, water, and oxidizing agents. 
Generally dyes are not easily biodegradable , and for this reason they are not fully 
removed in conventional biological plants. Therefore, a tertiary refining process is 
required for a complete decolourization in order to obtain an effluent of high quality 
suitable for reuse in the same dyehouse plant (Ferrero 2007).  Tertiary  treatments can be 
divided in three categories,  as summarized in Table 1.

Among these advanced treatments, at this moment, adsorption is considered more 
effective and less expensive than other techno logies. Activated carbon is the most used 
material, owing to its high ad sorption capacity, but it is expensive and needs a thermal 
regeneration process when the saturation is reached, in creasing further its cost.  
Research has been directed towards de veloping more effective and economical 
solutions, investigating the use of various lo w cost organic adsorbents. These materials 
should be low cost, easily available, a nd disposable without regeneration.  
Employing materials derived from natural s ources, plant wastes, or industrial by-
products could be a good way to reduce cost  problems. Examples of these kinds of 
materials used as adsorbents include: orange peel (Arami  et al. 2005), rice hulls, maize 
cob, bagasse pith, wheat straw, corn cobs, a nd wood chips. These have been studied and 
found effective and cheaper when compared with activated carbon (Nassar & El-Geundi 
1991; Nawar & Doma 1989; Nigam et al. 2000). Most of them are cellulose-based and can be employed without any previous  thermal or chemical treatment. 
 In this study the evaluation of dye adsorption on hazelnut  shells and its 
degradation are reported. The choice of this material is justified by its large availability in some countries, as a food industry waste. Nowadays, its major use is as combustible solid fuel, owing to its considerable calorific value (near 17 MJ/kg of dried product), very 
close to that of wood. 
The use of hazelnut shells as sorbents  with high surface area and without any 
thermal treatment was proposed in some studies  for the removal of toxic metal ions as 
Cr(VI) (Cimino et al. 2000; K obya 2004) and for the removal of dyes such as Methylene 
Blue (Ferrero 2007; Kannan and Sundaram 2001) and Acid Blue 25 (Ferrero 2007). 
The dye used in this work was Congo Re d, a direct azo dye employed for dyeing 
cellulosic fibers such as cotton. The adso rbed dye was biodegraded by the white-rot 
fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium . This  is a well known lignino lityc white-rot fungus 
that is able to degrade and in some cas es mineralize several xenobiotic compounds as 
polychlorinated biphenyl (Eaton 1985; Morris & Lester 1994), DDT (Bumpus et al. 1985; 
Bumpus & August 1987), dioxin (Hammel et al . 1986), benzo(a)pyrene (Hammerli et al. 
1986), trinitrotoluene (Fernando et al. 1990) and dyes (Wesemberg et al. 2003).  
The present work has two main aims: th e evaluation of Congo Red adsorption on 
hazelnut shells and its biodegrad ation by the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium , employing hazelnut shells with adsorbed dye as support-substrate for the 
microorganism growth.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL  
The experimental protocol followed in th is study can be summarized as below: 
¾ Evaluation of Congo Red adsorption rate on hazelnut shells. 
¾ Evaluation of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  growth on this material, focusing on 
the cultural medium composition in order to determine the best composition for 
the manganese dependent peroxidase (M nP) production. Three types of cultures 
were studied:

Strain and Culture Conditions 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 24725 (BKM-F-1767) was maintained on 
2% malt extract agar plates. Culture media were inoculated with conidia (5 x 1010/L) 
suspended in distilled water. 
A nitrogen limited medium with glucose as the carbon source was used, prepared 
according to Tien and Kirk (1988) plus asolec itin from soya bean (0.75 g/L). The initial 
pH value was 5.5, and the initial glucose a nd ammonium concentrations were 10.0 and 
0.04 g/L, respectively. The cultures were gr own at 39°C during the trophophase and at 
30°C during the idiophase, in pure oxygen atmosphere (Chimirri 2004). 
 
Dye Adsorption Studies 
Hazelnut shells were obtained from a nut processing factory situated in  the 
geographical area of Asti, nor thern Italy, where the variety Corylus avellana  is cultivated.  
Before their use, hazelnut shells were chopped to sizes of approximately 0.7 cm2, 
and then washed with deionized water acco rding to the following procedure: 30g of 
hazelnut shells were soaked in 100 mL of de ionized water in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks 
provided of baffles and agitated at 170 rpm on  an horizontal orbita l shaker for 24h at 
30°C in a thermostatic room.  
This washing was repeated three times; a sample of each washing liquid was 
taken.  Finally hazelnut shells were dried in air oven at 105 °C for 24 h. 
The samples of liquid coming from the washing pre-treatment required 24h at 
30°C for the natural sedimentation of suspended particles. At the end of this time samples 
of the clarified supernatant were taken a nd analysed spectrophotometrically using a 
Hewlett Packard 8452 Diode Array spectrophotometer. 
Stock solution of 10 g/L of Congo Red (Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc.) was 
used to prepare dye solutions at four different concentrations: 50, 500, 1000, and 5000 
mg/L. 
Adsorption experiments were carried out in  500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks; a ratio of 
10 g dry substrate : 100 mL dye solution was us ed. Hazelnut shells we re soaked in these 
solutions for up to 48h at 30°C in static conditions. 
Dye solution samples were taken at regular intervals during the test and 
centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 7 min using an  ultracentrifuge Centrikon T-42K. The 
clarified supernatants were analysed spect rophotometrically. Dye removal was calculated 
from the decrease of absorption at the λmax of Congo Red: 490 nm.  
Hazelnut shells separated from each dye solution were dried in air oven for 24 h 
at 105°C.

Carletto et. al. (2008). “Congo red adsorption,”  BioResources  3(4), 1146-1155.  1149 Finally a desorption test was carried out with the medium employed in 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  cultures, according to the following procedure: 20g of 
hazelnut shells coming from the adsorption test s were soaked in 250 ml of medium and 
incubated for 48h at 30°C. Liquid samples were collected and analyzed spectro-
photometrically.   
Biomass Growth Studies  
The experiments were carried out in sh allow stationary cultures with biomass 
immobilized on hazelnut shells, employing 500 mL Erlenmeyer and 2.8 L Fernback 
flasks. The amount of hazelnut shells was 20  g in Erlenmeyer and 90 g in Fernback 
flasks, with 70 and 300 mL medium volumes re spectively, in order to  maintain the same 
solid-liquid ratio of 1:3,5 in both types of flasks. These amount s of hazelnut shells were 
also chosen in order to cover the flasks botto m with a single layer of  material. All the 
cultures were flushed daily with pure oxygen. 
The initial temperature, corresponding to the trophopha se, was 39°C, turned down 
to 30°C at the beginning of the idiophase. 
Glucose and ammonium concentrations in  extracellular fluid were determined 
spectrophotometrically, using enzymatic k its (Boehringer and Mannheim, numbers 10 
716 251 035 and 11 112 732 035, respectively).  
MnP activity was determined spect rophotometrically on the undiluted 
extracellular fluid, by the proced ure of Paszinsky et al. (198 8) at 568 nm and 22°C, with 
2,6-dimethoxy-phenol as substrate. 
Dye degradation studies were carried out employing hazelnut shells treated with 
500 mg/L Congo Red solution. This concentrati on was chosen among the other three in 
order to reproduce the typical dye concentrat ion of a textile indus try effluent (Laing 
1996; Shelley 1994; Pierce 1994). Two biotic cultu res and an abiotic one  were carried out 
in order to evaluate the adsorbed dye degradation. 
These cultures were carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks, with 20 g of hazelnut shells 
and 70 mL of medium without carbon and nitrog en sources. Tests we re carried out until 
MnP enzymatic activity reached to zero in biotic cultures. 
Chemical extraction with 70% (v/v) methanol aqueous solution was used to 
recovery undegraded dye from hazelnut shel ls, according to the following procedure: 20 
g of shells, taken from cultures were transfe rred in Erlenmeyer flas ks and soaked in 100 
mL of methanol solution. The flasks were agitated at 170 rpm on a horizontal orbital 
shaker for 24h, at 30°C. The extr action was repeated three times. 
The liquid collected from each extraction was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 
λ=490 nm. The difference between the amount of adsorbed dye and the amount of 
extracted dye, corresponds to the amount of degraded dye in biotic cultures.  
  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Hazelnut Shells Pre-treatment 
A washing treatment was necessary not on ly to remove the impurities and the 
internal peel, but principally to study the release of coloured substances from hazelnut

characteristic wavelength of Congo Red. 
The washing was repeated eight times, and samples taken from each one were 
analyzed spectrophotometrically. The results showed that after the third washing the 
absorbance values were neglig ible at 490 nm, so a pre-treatme nt of three washing cycles 
was considered adequate.  
 
Adsorption Studies 
This test was carried out with four increasing dye concentrations: 50, 500, 1000, 
and 5000 mg/L in order to evaluate the adso rption rate on hazelnu t shells. Results are 
plotted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.

The results show that the maximum amount of adsorbed Congo Red was 13.75 
mg/g shells at 48 h, corresponding to 27.5% in the case of the 5000 mg/L concentration 
solution. In the case of the 500 mg/L C ongo Red solution, the maximum dye adsorbed 
amount was 1.87 mg/g shells at 48 h, corresponding to 37.5%.

that desorption phenomena did not take place , because no peak of absorbance was 
detected at the characterist ic wavelength of Congo Red. 
 
Biomass Growth and Enzymatic Production Studies 
Experimental tests on three different me dium compositions were carried out in 
500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, for the evaluation of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  growth on 
hazelnut shells and MnP production. 
It is known from the literature that the secretion of MnP is promoted by limited 
nutrients availability (Wesembe rg et al. 2003); for this reason and in order to verify if 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  was able to take nutrients  from the organic support, a 
complete composition medium was first c onsidered, then the carbon source was 
subtracted, and lastly also the nitrogen one. 
Cultural medium composition influen ces the trophophase time length (which 
occurs when nitrogen concentration reaches to  zero) and as consequence on the outset of 
MnP activity. This effect is shown in Fig. 3. This lag time is explained by the fact that the microorganism needs more time to extract the nutrients necessary for its growth from the 
organic support, because they are no t available in the cultural medium.

Each curve shows a maximum: the highest  MnP activity (more than 220 UI/L at 
129 h) was reached by the culture without car bon and nitrogen sources; lower activities 
were reached by the other two cultures : 86 UI/L at 216 h and 98 UI/L at 164 h 
respectively for cultures lacking of the carbon source and complete medium. MnP 
activity was detectable for more than 500 hour s (20 days) in the cas e of culture without 
carbon source and 570 and 596 hours in the case of  culture without carbon and nitrogen 
sources and cultures in complete medium, respectively. 
Another test was carried out employing a 2.8 L Fernback flask, in order to study 
the maximum time length reachable by the cultu re lacking of the carbon and the nitrogen 
sources and to simulate a scale-up of Erle nmeyer culture conditions; the results are 
plotted in Fig. 4.

Carletto et. al. (2008). “Congo red adsorption,”  BioResources  3(4), 1146-1155.  1152 Trophophase time length was near 120 hours, as  in the case of Erlenmeyer tests 
with the same type of cultural medium composition. The presence of some relative 
maxima is due to the availa bility of carbon source; the s econd relative maximum at 362 h 
after the first at 180 h, is probably the cons equence of the extrac tion of carbon from the 
organic support by the microorganism. In or der to demonstrate this fact when the 
enzymatic activity fell down at 872 h, glucos e was added. Triangular dots represent the 
time when glucose as the carbon source was added in the cultural medium, at 872, 992, 
and 1186 hours. In all cases the MnP activity increased, reaching 70 UI/L, and more than 
80 UI/L after the second a ddition, and 120 UI/L after the third one. The maximum time 
length reached without glucose addition was near 850 hours, at more than one month.

Considering these results, the cultural medium composition lacking of carbon and 
nitrogen sources was chosen to produce Phanerochaete chrysosporium  for dye 
degradation studies. 
 
Dye Adsorbed Degradation Studies 
Tests were carried out with three differe nt cultures: one with hazelnut shells 
without adsorbed Congo Red and two treat ed with dye solution at different 
concentrations, in order to evaluate not onl y dye degradation, but also dye effect on 
growth and  MnP production of Phanerochaete chrysosporium . The results are plotted in 
Fig. 5. 
MnP activity started, in the case of the culture employing hazelnut shells treated 
with 500 mg/L dye solution, at 96 h, as in th e case of absence of adsorbed dye, earlier 
than the 209 h of the culture employing haze lnut shells treate d with 50 mg/L dye 
solution. The maximum MnP activity was quite different between the three cultures: 115 
UI/L at 257 h of the no dye lin e, while the culture 500 mg/L dye reached 91 UI/L at  257 
h, and the culture 50 mg/L dye 75 UI/L at 353 h.  
MnP activity time length of the higher con centration dye culture  was also longer, 
it ended after more than 400 hours (16 days),  double if compared wi th the one of the 
lower concentration dye cultures.

Carletto et. al. (2008). “Congo red adsorption,”  BioResources  3(4), 1146-1155.  1153 After this consideration it is possible to say that the presence of adsorbed dye did 
not inhibit the microorganism growth and Mn P activity. On the contrary in this case, 
MnP activity time length and maximum activity value were promoted by the highest dye 
concentration.

At this point, in order to evaluate the dye degradation efficiency of the 500 mg/L 
culture, a methanol extraction was carried out to recollect undegraded Congo Red from 
hazelnut shells used in the biot ic and in the abiotic cultures . 
Examining the results obtained from the methanol extraction, reported in Table 2 
and comparing them with the ones collected in  Fig. 2 about adsorption test, it is possible 
to say that 160 mg/L on 187 mg/L adsorbed  by hazelnut shells were recovered with 
methanol extraction from the abiotic culture.  It  is possible to see that more than 43% of 
adsorbed dye was degraded by the microorganism  in biotic culture; the difference of 16% 
between the results obtained from culture “biotic1” and “biotic2” is attributed to biological variability. 
Finally it is possible to say that taking into consideration these results, cultural 
conditions could be optimized to obtain not only higher but more pe rsistent over time 
MnP activity in order to increase the amount  of degradation of adsorbed dye. Future 
developments could be the set-up of a fixed bed reactor with Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium immobilized onto  hazelnut shells for dyehouse effluent degradation.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
1. From this study it is possible to employ h azelnut shells, broken in small sizes, as a 
potentially inexpensive biosorbent w ithout previous thermal treatment. 
2. Shallow stationary immobilized cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  on an 
organic vegetable matter were not proposed until now, whereas in some other studies 
the cultures were made to grow on inert materials such as ceramic Rashig rings or ceramic Berl saddles (Bosco et al. 1999). 
3. It was demonstrated that Phanerochaete chrysosporium  is able to grow and to 
produce MnP in the absence of  macronutrients (carbon and ni trogen sources) from the 
cultural medium and is able to take  out them from the organic support. 
4. After the evaluation of the best culture conditions, it was demonstrated that 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  is able to degrade more than 43% of Congo Red 
adsorbed on hazelnut shells from a solution of 500 mg/L.
