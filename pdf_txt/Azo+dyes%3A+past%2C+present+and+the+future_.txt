Abstract  
In this work, we have presented a review of azo dyes which are the most important synthetic colorants that have 
been widely used in textiles, Azo dyes are organic compounds, that contain the coloring azo function (N=N)and 
are used in the production of colored materials. Azo compounds have vivid colors and comprise about t wo-thirds 
of all synthetic dyes. azo dyes, such as monoazo, diazo, and triazo dyes, are defined by the presence of one or 
more azo groups ( -N=N -) connected to the –OH or –NH2 type auxochrome groups. Then we pointed out the 
synthesis of azo dyes using the t raditional method(diazotization/coupling reaction) and prepared a new azo dye 
using natural polyphenols found in plants, which are used as coupling agents. Finally, we indicate the Dyeing 
process of cotton fabric with azoic dyes as used in the textile indu stry. 
Keywords: Azo dyes, synthesis of azo dyes, types of azo dyes . 
1. Coloration  
For the past century, coloring has been  an 
important vision factor for humans , especially in the 
textile industry, coloring is defined as an important 
factor for the textile. [1-8] There are two methods to 
impart color to the textile materials, first is dyeing , 
and the second is printing. [9-14] In addition, there 
are several dye classes used in the textile sector. One 
of the most commonly  used dyes is azo dye.  
  
2. Azo Dyes  
Azo dyes make up the biggest category  of 
color ants, accounting for 70% of all organic dyes 
manufactured globally [15, 16] and 60% of the 
usage [16, 17]. Azo  Dyes are grouped into around 
twenty -five distinct categories due to the varied 
chemical structures of chromophores [17, 18]. The 
success of azo dyes is a result of their easy synthesis 
processes, extensive structural variety, high molar 
extinction coefficient, low cost , and medium to high 
fastness characteristics concerning  light and 
moisture [19]. They are used for a variety of 
purposes, including the coloring  of natural and 
manmade materials, ink, cosmetics, food, leather , 
and painting solutions [20-24]. 
Azo compounds are chemically represented as R –
N=N -R’, where R or R' can be either aryl or alkyl 
compounds, and –N=N - is the azo group. [25] The majority of azo dyes are made by diazotizing 
an aromatic primary amine and then coupling it with 
one or more electron -rich nucleophiles, such as 
hydroxy and amino. Additional techniques for 
creating azo dyes as reducing nitroaromatic 
derivatives in an alkaline medium; oxidising primary 
amines with lead tetraacetate or permanganate 
potassium; condensing hydrazines and quinones; and 
condensing primar y amines with nitroso 
derivatives. [26, 27] 
 
2.1. Definition of azo dyes  
The dyes are synthetic aromatic organic 
compounds, as is widely known, and are often 
employed to color  or dye various sub-standard  
materials for aesthetic and other functional purposes. 
The textile sector is a significant user of various 
synthetic dyes and contributes significantly to the 
nation's economic development. [21] 
 
2.2. History of Azo Dyes  
For the past few years, Azo Dyes have been in 
use. The simplest Azo dyes to use are direct dyes. 
These direct dyes have chemical components that 
enable them to dissolve in water and be readily 
absorbed by various substances. The first Azo dye, 
Congo red, w as employed in 1884; however, more 
chemically synthesized  dyes that are more heat - and  Esraa El -Sayed  et. al.

light -resistant have since taken their  place . Azo 
pigments are the most common and ancient type of 
food coloring . In 1858, Peter Griess discovered  
them. [28, 29] 
 
2.3. Organic chemistry of azo dye  
Azo dyes have an azo group —-N = N —[23, 30-
32]that joins two hybridized carbon atoms,  these 
carbons frequently, but not always, are a component 
of aromatic systems. [33] Azo dyes are comprised of 
an amine or phenol linked to a diazotized amine. [34] 
A single azo group makes up the majority of azo 
dyes, although others include two (disazo), three 
(trisazo), or even more [31, 35]  
Based on the exact structure of the molecule, azo 
dyes can produce a full spectrum of colors . Azo dye 
compounds may be found in the colors  yellow, 
orange, red, brown, and blue [36]. Different 
replacements for aromatic rings lead to differences in 
the system's degree of conjugation in the azo dye, 
which affects color . As is well-known , a molecule's 
ability to absorb visible light at a certain wavelength 
relies on the size of its conjugated system [37-39]. 
For example:  
(Shortest π system) → yellow → orange → red → 
green → blue (longest π system) . 
 
2.3.1.  Azo groupe  
A double -bonded azo linkage makes up the 
chromophore group, the portion of an azo-colorant  
molecule that creates color . The azo color ants' 
chromophoric group changes a substrate's color  by 
either selectively  absorbing or dispersing visible 
light, or light with wavelengths of around 400 -
750nm [40]  
Two nitrogen atoms make up the azo linkage, and 
they are also connected to carbon atoms. One or more  
of these carbon atoms are part of an aromatic 
carbocycle, an aryl moiety (often found in 
derivatives of benzene or naphthalene), or a 
heterocycle (pyrazolone, thiazole, etc.). The azo 
group's second around carbon may also be a 
component of an aliphatic de rivative, such as 
acetoacetic acid . 
An azo-colorant  molecule can be summed up as 
follows in general  
aryl - N = N - R 
where R may be an aryl, heteroaryl , or -CH = 
C(OH) - alkyl derivatives  
 
2.3.2.  Azo dye formation and structure  
Figure 1 illustrates the general chemical structure 
of an azo dye, which is made up of a backbone, auxochrome groups, chromophoric groups, and 
solubilizing groups [26, 35]. 
 
The azo bonds  together with the chromophores 
and auxochromes they are linked to, define the color  
of the azo dyes [30] 
 
2.4. Classification of dyes according to azo 
grouping number (Classification of azo dyes 
in Color Index)  
According to how many azo links are present in a 
single dye molecule, azo dyes are classified as 
monoazo, disazo, tri -sazo, polyazo, and azoic [41-
43]. A value between 11,000 and 39,999 is given to 
azo dyes in the Color  Index (CI) system to match 
their molecular composition (Table 1). The 
organization  of dyers and colorists developed the 
color  index number, which is used to classify dyes 
[26, 44-46]  
 
Chemical Class              CI no.  
 Mono azo                      11000 -19999  
 Bis-azo                          20000 -29999  
Tris-azo                          30000 -34999  
 Polyazo                          35000 -36999  
 Azoic                             37000 -39999  
 
2.4.1.  Mono azo dyes  
Mono Azo dyes are dyes with only one azo group 
in their chemical  structure [47]. 
These dyes  can be classified into  
− Dyes do not contain dissolving groups  
− Dyes that contain dissolving groups: [48] 
 
2.4.2.  Dyes that do not contain -SO 3H, -COOH 
groups  
These groups include dyes: Solvent, Pigment, 
Mordant, Basic, Disperse and reactive  
 
2.4.2.1.  Solvent Mono Azo Dyes  
A small number of mono -azo dyes are employed 
as solvent dyes. This set of dyes is incapable of 
forming a solubilizing group.

Example: Sudan Red R or Solvent Red R               
CI-12155  
By diazotizing cresidine and combining it with B -
Naphthol, Sudan Red R is made.  
 
2.4.2.2.  Pigment Mono Azo Dyes  
The following is an important example of this 
family of insoluble mono -azo dyes that are utilized  
as pigment [49].  
ex: pigments orange 5           CI -12075  
 
2.4.2.3.  Mordant Mono Azo Dyes  
This dye cannot be applied directly to the fiber ; 
instead, a basic mordant must be applied to the fiber 
They can create a complicated metallic 
compound called a lake  
The presence of an o -hydroxyl group that reacts 
with the azo linkage to produce metal complexes 
makes azo dyes mordant  
Because of their high light and washing fastness, 
mordant dyes are important. [50] 
 
C.I. Mordant Yellow1 
   
2.4.2.4.  Basic (cationic) Mono Azo Dyes  
Basic dyes have an auxochromic group of -NH2 
or -NR2 and a chromophore  system of -N-N. 
The light fastness and washing fastness are often 
quite poor. Because of these factors, basic color s are 
rarely employed in the textile business  
Example: Chromotope 2  
  
2.4.2.5.  Disperse Mono Azo Dyes  
Disperse dyes are mostly used to give polyester  
fiber  a yellow -to-blue tint. Additionally, natural 
fibers  like wool and silk are utilized  with it  
Disperse mono -azo dyes  have a simple structure 
and small molecules. As a result, it enters the fiber  
structure with easy  
For instance, Cellition scanet B or Disperse Red 
13 
The compound is made by diazotizing 2 -chloro -
4-nitro aniline  and coupling it to N -ethyl N -hydroxyl 
ethyl aniline  
 
 
2.4.2.6.  Reactive Mono Azo Dyes  
Monoazo reactive dyes using a dichloro triazine  
reactive  system , Example : Reactive Red B [51]  
 
2.4.3.  Dyes that contain -SO3H, -COOH groups 
is called  
The major  soluble mono -azo dyes are listed 
below.  
− Acid dyes  
− Mordant dyes  
− Direct dyes  
 
2.4.3.1.  Acid dyes  
Acid azo dyes are relatively cheap dyes that are 
used in dyeing wool  from an acidic medium, as they 
give moderate to good degrees of fastness, especially 
against light.  
For example, C.I. dye. Acid Orange 20

2.4.3.2.  Mordant dyes  
The soluble -SO3H group is also present in 
several mordant dyes. They have an ortho -oH group 
to the azo linkage, which can form a complex with 
the mordant  
Ex-mordant brown 13  
 
2.4.3.3.  Direct dyes  
This group of dyes is used to directly color  
leather, silk, and other porous fibers  like wool.  Ex 
Acid Violet: 1.  
 
2.4.4.  Bis (Dis) Azo Dyes  
Bisazo dyes are those that have two azo groups in 
their chemical composition [52] This category 
includes a lot of azo dyes. There are four kinds of bis 
azo dyes available. The following general formula is 
given to each class.  
 
− 1. D → Z  D’  
− 2. C  T → C’  
− 3. D → CN → C  
− 4. D → ZXZ  D 
Where, D = Diazo component, T = Tetrazo 
component , C = coupling component coupled with 
one molecule of a diazo component, CN = an 
aromatic which after coupling with a diazo 
component provides an amino group for further 
diazotization, and Z = a coupling component coupled 
with two molecules of diazo components  
In ZXZ, X May be -NH, - NHCONH -, or more 
complex Linkages  
 
2.4.4.1.  Disazo dyes of the type D → Z  D’ 
There are a small number of soluble dyes in 
this group , and the soluble ones are either acidic or mordant , and they are often blue, red, brown, and 
black colors. An example of these dyes is:  C.I. Acid 
Green 19  
 
 
2.4.4.2.  Disazo dyes of the type C  T → C’ 
This group is very significant in the pigment 
industry and is regarded as one of the biggest groups 
of di -azo dyes. There are a lot of direct dyes in it, and 
there aren't many acidic or fixative dyes. Usually, the 
Tetrazo component defines whether the color  
produced is acidic or direct.  
There are a small number of important direct dyes 
that can  be prepared from the diamine compound, 
and the general dye follows the following:  
 
An important example is C.I. Direct Yellow 12  
 
 
It is then followed by an ethylation process and 
used as a direct dye  
 
2.4.4.3.  Disazo dyes of the type D → CN → C 
More than 250 dyes are known from this group, 
about half of which are direct dyes and the rest 
include acid dyes and some Mordant dyes . 
As an example of direct dyes, C.I. Direct Red 81, 
uses a mono -azo dye containing an amine group that 
can be azotized again and is considered a diazo 
compound.  
 
 
2.4.4.4.  Disazo dyes of the type D → ZXZ  D 
This important group includes direct dyes, which 
can be divided into two types

2.4.4.4.1.  Dyes include urea derivatives –
NHCONH  
As an example, C.I. Direct Yellow 49  
 
  
The reaction is carried out by passing phosgene 
gas through an alkaline solution of the dye, where the 
reaction takes place as follows  : 
2R-NH2 + COCl2 → R-NHCONH -R + 2HCl  
The resulting acid reacts with the increase in 
alkali. Two different mono -azo dyes can be used and 
the phosgene binds them together to produce an 
asymmetric dye . 
 
2.4.4.4.2.  Dyes that contain Carbonyl - J acid as 
a coupling compound in the middle  
- J acid urea  : as an example  
The dyes derived from this compound are widely 
used 
C.I. stain Direct red 23 (chlorazol scarlet 4BS)  
 
 
2.4.5.  Tris Azo Dyes  
These dyes divide into several  subgroups, three 
of which are especially important. These groupings 
frequently include polyazo dyes as well as direct 
dyes. 
 
2.4.5.1.  Trisazo dyes of types  D → Z  T → C 
This group's pigments are frequently color ed 
black or brown. For instance, we obtain C.I. Direct 
Black 38 by the following three duplication 
operations: - 
 2.4.5.2.  Trisazo dyes of the type C’  CN  T → 
C 
The pigments of this group include the colors 
brown, olive blue, and black, and they are the largest 
of the groups in terms of the number of pigments 
belonging to them.  
As an example, the C.I. pigment. Direct Brown 
54 
 
2.4.5.3.  Trisazo dyes of the type D → CN → CN’ 
→ C 
They include blue and gray direct dyes, and when 
C is the compound J acid or N -phenyl - J acid, the 
resulting dyes have strong color shades and good 
adaptability to cellulose fibers . Examples of 
frequently used dyes are the following:  
C.I. Direct Blue 71 (Chlorantine Fast Blue GLL)  
 
 
2.4.6.   Poly azo dye  
Complex dyes are called polyazo dyes. They have 
a molecule with three or more azo groups. They are 
included in the category of direct dyes. They use 
black, brown, and red dyes to color leather.  
 
 
Direct red is the most popular dye for this type of 
color(figer ) [53, 54]. The latter can be produced by 
phosgenating the suitable diazo dye. After N -acetyl -
J is acid coupled, 6 -amino -3,4′-azodibenzene -
sulfonic acid can be diazotized to accomplish this. 
The hydrolysis of the acetyl group occurs before the 
phosgenation stage [18]. 
 
2.5. Synthesis of azo dyes Chemically by the 
diazotization/coupling reaction  
Azo dyes are man -made substances with an azo 
link, -N=N [55], and are often made from the 
 Esraa El -Sayed  et. al.  
________________________________________________________________________________________________  
Egypt. J. Chem. 67, SI: M. R. Mahran  (2024)  92 
aromatic amine substrates nitro and nitroso. The 
employment of an adequate oxidizing/reducing 
reaction or a diazotization/coupling reaction is 
essential to the synthesis procedures. One of the most 
significant reactions in the growth of industrial 
organic chemistry is this one. A coupling component 
and a diazonium salt are needed for the synthesis  
 
 
Scheme 1 depicts a two -stage reaction pathway 
that includes diazotization and azo coupling [56]. A 
primary aromatic amine (ArNH2), also known as the 
diazo component, is treated with sodium nitrite in the 
first stage of diazotization to create a diazonium salt 
(ArN+Cl -), under -regulated acidity and at fairly low 
temperatures. The more unstable diazon ium salt is 
therefore reacted with a coupling component, such as 
a phenol, an aromatic amine, or a -ketoacid 
derivative, in the second stage of the process, known 
as azo coupling, to create the azo dye  [37] 
The majority of diazonium salts are explosive and 
unstable when they are dry. They are always 
synthesized at 0 °C with continuous stirring in an 
acid medium to reduce contact with water and create 
phenol, and they are then employed directly in the 
coupling  reaction.  
The diazonium salt interacts as an electrophile 
with a coupling component that is rich in electrons (a 
phenol or an aniline) which gives different colors of 
azo dye [37]when used to finish the production of the 
azo color  
 
2.5.1.1.  Factors affecting the rate of diazotization 
reaction (Dye formation)  
Diazotization happens between 0 and 5°C in 
temperature. The diazonium salt breaks down when 
the temperature rises . 
• Temperature  
• a concentration of acid   -  
• pH of Sodium nitrite's (NaNO2)   
 
2.6. Synthesis  of azo dyes by Gewald reaction  
Using the Gewald process to create azo dye 
Applic ations of this reaction include peptide 
analogs, dyes, and electronic materials; moreover, 
conjugated carbohydrates, agrochemicals, medicines 
and biomedicine, cane masters, etc.  
As per Ram W. Sabnis [29, 57], azo dyes 26 
(Figure ),  were produced by condensation of benzo -
thiophene -3 (2H) -one-1,1-dioxide with ethyl 
cyanoacetate. This was followed by diazotization 
using nitrosyl sulfuric acid and coupling with aryl 
amines substituted with N, N -dialkyl (acid 
coupling). [29] 
 
 
other methods for the synthesis of azo dyes  
• Ther are other techniques for making azo dyes 
include  
• Reducing nitroaromatic derivatives in an 
alkaline medium, reducing nitrosated 
compounds with AILIH4, oxidizing primary 
amines with potassium permanganate or lead 
tetraacetate, condensing hydrazines and 
quinones, and condensing primary amines of 
nitrosated derivatives [26, 27]. 
• Various synthetic techniques have been used 
to create new generations of azo dyes [58, 
59]. hydrazone, chromene, and derivatives of 
2-amhothiophene and 2 -aminothiazoles, for

instance, are chemical groups found in the 
azo dye syntheses [60, 61]. 
Synthesis of azo dyes naturally by using 
polyphenolic  compound in plants as a coupling 
agent  
Focus has been placed on developing non -toxic 
or less hazardous dyes through health, safety, and 
environmental requirements during the past 20 years 
in the synthetic dye sector [62].  However, businesses 
that produce colors that cause cancer or those that 
include harsh chemicals still exist. Today, several 
studies have been conducted to rediscover the delight 
of producing color using sustainable, non -toxic, 
natural sources [63]. Generally speaking, azo dyes are 
not found in nature and can only be created 
chemically. To lessen the harmful effects, however, 
numerous azo dyes have lately been made utilizing 
certain natural sources. [50, 64, 65] 
plants have vast quantities of Polyphenolic 
compounds as figer  (Phenolic acid, flavonoids, 
lignans, and stilbenes) which are used  as possible 
substitutes for synthetic phenols that can be reacted 
as a coupling agent  with diazonium salts  to create 
azo compounds [66] 
 
 
innovative azoic dyeing technique, in which 
polyphenol -containing natural dyes successfully 
increased the color strength and fastness 
characteristics of colored various textiles.  The 
method for azoic dyeing with natural dyes is the same as for conventional azoic dyeing; however, natural 
coupling components or plant polyphenols are used 
in place of the synthetic coupling component. [66, 67] 
Ex:-  
• Dyeing of Polyester and Nylon with Semi -
synthetic Azo Dye by Chemical Modification 
of Natural Source Areca Nut [66] in this paper 
using three distinct primary amines —p-nitro 
aniline, p -anisidine, and aniline —that had 
been diazotized to create their corresponding 
diazonium salts which coupled with an areca 
nut extract (epicatechin) [66].  
• Preparation of Azo Dye from Acacia catechu 
and its Application on Silk Fabrics [64] 
The two parts of our azoic dyeing procedure are 
shown in Figure 1: first, the coupling component was 
absorbed into the fabric, and then, in situ, coupling 
was performed with the diazotization of a primary 
aromatic amine to create azo colors inside the fibe r 
[66, 67]. 
 
 
 
Advantages of azoic dyeing  
1- Textile materials can be dyed in a variety of 
physical shapes using a variety of 
machinery, or even in small quantities with 
household items in the absence of 
machinery [68]  
2- It is easy for synthesis processes, high 
solubility, and high substrate 
absorption. [31, 69] 
3- It is feasible to get dark blue, black, orange, 
and red hues economically   
4- The reproducibility of dyes is quite good.  
5- Commercial economic sustainability and 
low cost [40].  
6- Dischargeable combinations are the 
majority.  
7- Overall, the fastness characteristics are 
good  
 
Disadvantages of azoic dyeing  
1- The application process is difficult and drawn 
out 
 Esraa El -Sayed  et. al.  
________________________________________________________________________________________________  
Egypt. J. Chem. 67, SI: M. R. Mahran  (2024)  94 
2- Several chemicals must be used and preserved. 
difficulties handling the constituent compounds 
under common chemical processing 
applications particularly the diazotization of 
aromatic amines' rapid bases  
3- available hues are a few 
4- It has always been difficult to make azoic -
colored material fast to rubbing.  To produce 
good rubbing fastness, it is crucial to effectively 
remove surplus naphthol from the surface of the 
treated material, have a high coupling 
component substantivity, and  thoroughly soap 
the material after development  
5- Since there would be cross -coupling between 
different naphthols and diazonium salt, 
compound hues as generated with other dye 
classes by mixing three or four dyes are difficult 
to make with azoic dyes and the combined 
shades are unpredictable and non -repro ducible   
6- Only after the coupling stage is the final shade 
apparent. As a result, any unevenness that 
results from naphtholation may be unnoticed 
and only become apparent after coupling, when 
shade correction is hard  
Textile coloration with azo dye  
Azo dyes offer an enormous range of colors 
with high fixing qualities and stability. It is noted that 
of the approximately 3,000 different dye types 
available on the market, approximately 50% belong 
to the category of azo dyes [42]. In cotton fabric 
bright colors like orange, crimson, scarlet, navy blue, 
and black are produced using azoic dyes.  
There are several azo dye varieties and 
categorization schemes in use. Disperse dyes, metal -
complex dyes, reactive dyes direct dyes, and acid 
dyes are types of azo dyes applied in textiles.  Direct 
dyes are used on cotton and other cellulose -based 
fabrics. The non -electrostatic forces cause the dyes 
to attach to the fabric. The acid azo dyes are applied 
using a process that is nearly identical to that of the 
direct class and has an affinity for wool and silk. 
Yellow acid azo color tartrazine was developed in  
1884 and is still widely used today. acid azo dyes 
showed fair to very good fastness against rubbing, 
perspiration, and washing. They can be applied to 
wool as dyes. [70, 71] 
The two most frequent metals utilized in these 
colors are chromium and copper. These dyes' 
characteristics are changed by adding other metals, 
which allows them  to serve a variety of functions. 
These eco -friendly, economical, and long -lasting 
dyes are the best available, offering a large range of 
options for many sectors. [71] 
 Dyeing process of cotton fabric with azoic dyes  
It is not possible  to find these dyes premade. 
There are three primary steps in the azoic dyeing 
process. [33, 34, 72] They are  a) Naphtholation, b) 
Diazotisation, and c) Coupling  
Naphtholation  
Naphthols are insoluble in water and require the 
treatment of an alkali to become soluble in water. [73] 
 
Fabric is impregnated with this salt solution.  
Diazotisation  
At a temperature of –5 C, a base having an 
amino group ( -NH2) combines with sodium nitrite 
(NaNO2) to generate a diazonium chloride solution 
of that base in the presence of enough HCl. [48, 73] 
 
Coupling  
The impregnated material requires treatment in 
a diazonium solution bath to facilitate coupling, 
which produces color inside the fabric. Maintaining 
the PH is important.  
  
Summary  
Azo dyes now have the highest dye chemistry 
production volume, and in the future, their relative 
importance could further increase. Azo dyes are 
often utilized in many different industries, including 
the food, pharmaceutical, paper, cosmetics, textile, 
and leather sectors.  Azo compounds have vivid 
colors  and have several types  of monoazo, diazo, and 
triazo dyes  There  are most methods to synthesize  azo 
dyes as  the Gewald reaction , Synthesis of azo dyes 
Chemically by the diazotization/coupling reaction  
(More than 60 % of the synthesized dyes are 
produced by this reaction)and Synthesis of azo dyes 
naturally by using the poly phenolic compound in 
plants as coupling agent this method increased the 
color strength and fastness characteristics of colored 
various textiles.  The Different dyes which have an 
azo group in chemical structure and give good 
properties and fastness when applied to fabric
