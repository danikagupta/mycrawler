Introduction
Recent progress in periodontal biology has demonstrated that 
undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells and progenitor cells 
exist within the periodontal ligament [1,2] Therefore, enhancing 
the biological potential of these cells facilitates periodontal tissue 
regeneration. Bioactive factors that stimulate cellular proliferation 
and differentiation, such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-
2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor 
(IGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and basic fibroblast 
growth factor (bFGF), contribute to bone metabolism and to the 
organic inflammatory reaction, which is the healing process that 
takes place in wounds [3-5].
Many studies have shown that topically applying these 
bioactive factors to periodontal bone defects leads to regeneration 
of periodontal tissues [6-8]. We are particularly interested in bFGF, 
which has been shown to enhance the proliferation potency and 
chemotaxis of certain cells that originate in periodontal tissue and 
to enhance the healing of periodontal wounds [9-11]. Recent data 
gathered in a Phase II and III clinical trial regarding periodontal   
disease demonstrated that topical application of bFGF can 
successfully treat infrabony defects and class 2 furcation defects 
[12,13]. In this clinical experiment, hydroxypropyl cellulose was 
used as a vehicle to deliver bFGF in a controlled pattern of release. 
However, the half-life of the material proved to be short in the 
physiological environment. Therefore, a larger dosage is necessary 
for bFGF to be effective. In a search for materials that perform well, 
researchers have experimented with a variety of growth-factor 
delivery systems. They have incorporated growth factors into 
natural polymers, synthetic polymers, and ceramics, and they have 
experimented with physical entrapment, chemical immobilization, 
and other means to harness the growth factors into the delivery 
vehicles. Ikada et al. [14,15] have developed a drug delivery system 
(DDS) in which a growth factor that has been incorporated into 
gelatin hydrogel is released sustainably during the degradation of 
the gelatin hydrogel within the living body [16]. 
In their experiments with bone defects in animals, they found 
a significant increase in quantity of bone formed due to the bFGF-Abstract
We report here the clinical effects of the sustained release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) from gelatin hydrogel in cases of 
periodontal disease with infrabony defects. Patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis were treated with a mucoperiosteal flap 
operation. At the time of surgery, each bone defect was filled with gelatin hydrogel incorporating bFGF (bFGF/gelatin hydrogel). Probing pocket 
depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and radiographic bone level were evaluated before treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 months after 
treatment. There were significant improvements in clinical parameters after treatment. There were no adverse effects during the treatment 
period. Topical application of bFGF/gelatin hydrogel may promote periodontal regeneration in cases of chronic periodontitis with infrabony 
defects.

topical application of bFGF/ gelatin hydrogel considerably enhanced 
periodontal regeneration in a primate model [19]. We have sought 
to extend our knowledge of effective treatments of bone loss and 
periodontal disease with the case report presented here. Our goal is 
to further develop clinically effective methods of topically applying 
bFGF/gelatin hydrogel to treat chronic periodontitis accompanied 
by infrabony defects.
Materials and Methods
Patients and study population
For this clinical study, we recruited 23 patients (17 females 
and 6 males with a mean age of 50.3 years) who had moderate 
to advanced chronic periodontitis and who were scheduled to 
receive periodontal therapy at the Yokohama Clinic and Hospital 
of Kanagawa Dental University (Table 1). The study design and consent forms were approved by the ethics committee of Kanagawa 
Dental University. Criteria for enrollment in the study were: 
a) a non-compromised systemic health condition and no 
contraindications for periodontal surgery; 
b) a probing attachment loss equal to or greater than 4 mm; 
and
c) Clinical and radiographic evidence of the presence of an 
interproximal defect with an infrabony component. All study 
subjects had destruction of periodontal tissue and at least one 
1-, 2- or 3-walled bone defect. This clinical trial was conducted 
according to the schedule shown in Figure 1. Before periodontal 
surgical treatment, each patient received an initial preparatory 
session, including oral hygiene instruction, scaling, and root 
planing.
Figure 1: Clinical trial schedule. The clinical trial was conducted in accordance with the clinical trial schedule.Periodontal 
examination consisted of measuring probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level.
bFGF/gelatin hydrogel preparation
The gelatin used in this study is an acid gelatin hydrogel that 
has an adjusted isoelectric point of 5.0 with moisture content of 
95%. It is of cow bone origin (Nitta Gelatin Co., Japan). The acid 
gelatin was freeze-dried, and a safety identification test and a 
sterility test were conducted. The bFGF used Fiblast Spray (Kaken 
Pharmaceutical Co., Japan) which is a human recombinant protein 
and pharmaceutical authorized as a therapeutic agent for pressure 
sores and skin ulcers. The bFGF/gelatin hydrogel material was 
prepared before surgery. A bFGF water solution consisting of 250 
µg of bFGF dissolved in 300 µl of purified water was prepared. The 
bFGF-water solution was applied to a freeze-dried gelatin sheet and adjusted to contain 100 µg of bFGF for every 20 mg of gelatin and 
was left standing afterwards for 24 hours at 4 ˚C.
Surgical procedures
Following local anesthesia, intra-crevicular incisions were 
made extending to the neighboring teeth. Then, full-thickness 
mucoperiosteal flaps were raised vestibularly and orally. All 
granulation tissues were removed from defects and the roots were 
thoroughly scaled and planed by means of manual instruments. The 
defects and the adjacent mucoperiosteal flaps were then thoroughly 
rinsed with sterile saline, after which the defects werefilled with 
bFGF/gelatin hydrogel (Figure 2). After placing the hydrogel 
material, the flaps were repositioned and closed with sutures.

Postoperative care
All patients received antibiotics orally for 5 days following 
surgery. The sutures were removed 7 to 14 days after surgery. 
Recall appointments were scheduled weekly during the first 4 weeks after surgery and then once a month for the rest of the 1-year 
observation period. Safety evaluations were conducted, subjective 
symptoms were recorded, and objective findings were confirmed 
by interview and visual inspection.Goichi Matsumoto . Biomed J Sci & Tech Res Volume 4- Issue 2: 2018

3822Outcomes
The experimental outcomes of interest included soft-tissue and 
hard-tissue measurements of the intra-oral radiographs taken with 
a parallel technique:
a. Change in probing pocket depth (PPD) 
b. Change in clinical attachment level (CAL) 
c. Changes in the radiographic values of linear bone gain 
(LBG) and percentage of bone fill (BF) 
The values of LBG and BF were determined by measuring intra-
oral radiographs in accordance with the methods of Nevins et al. 
[20]. LBG was determined by measuring the distance from the CEJ 
to the base of the defect at the baseline minus the distance from 
the CEJ to the base of the defect at each of the post-surgical time 
points. The radiographic rate of bone fill was calculated by dividing 
the LBG by the depth of the original bone defect.
Statistical analysis
For statistical evaluation of the change from baseline to 3, 6, 
and 12 months, we used the Wilcoxson signed-rank test.

The characteristics of the subjects in this study are shown in 
Table 1. The bFGF dose ranged from 40 µg to 185 µg (mean 89.7 
µg). All subjects completed the study; in all cases postoperative 
healing was uneventful. No allergic reactions, abscesses, infections, 
or other complications were observed during the study period. 
The pre-treatment and post-treatment clinical parameters are 
shown in Table 2. We compared the values of PPD, CAL, and LBG 
at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment with the pre-treatment 
values. From before treatment to 12 months after treatment, the 
changes in mean PPD and mean CAL of treated sites were 3.8 ± 1.9 
mm and 5.9 ± 2.0 mm, respectively. Also, at 12 months following 
treatment, hard tissue showed a mean LBG of 3.5 ± 2.1 mm and a 
mean BF of 61.8 ± 25.2%. The mean depth of bone defects was less 
at both 6 months and 12 months compared with the pre-treatment 
mean (Figure 3). These differences were statistically significant. A 
representative case treated with bFGF/gelatin hydrogel is shown in 
Figure 2. In this case, the 12-month radiograph showed good bone 
fill compared with the pre-treatment radiograph (Figure 4).

Scientific & Technical Research (BJSTR)3823Discussion
Gelatin, a denatured collagen, is obtained by acid and alkaline 
processing of collagen isolated from bovine bone. This processing 
affects the electrical nature of collagen, yielding gelatin with 
different isoelectric points (IEPs) [15]. When mixed with positively 
or negatively charged gelatin, an oppositely charged protein 
ionically interacts to form a polyion complex. When bFGF that has 
been ionically complexed to an acidic gelatin hydrogel is placed 
in a target site, the bFGF will be released after a periodas a result 
of hydrogel degradation [21,22]. The degradation is controllable 
by changing the extent of cross-linking, which, in turn, affects the 
water content of the hydrogel. The rate of bFGF release accords well 
with the rate of hydrogel degradation.Gelatin hydrogel releases the 
protein drug without interfering with biological activity [16,22]. 
The optimum water content for promoting bone formation without 
disturbing it due to unabsorbed gelatin is 90-98% [23,24]. In the 
present study, the water content of the hydrogel was 95%. The 
bFGF release period associated with hydrogel degradation was 
expected to be about 4 weeks. We had no trouble placing bFGF/
gelatin hydrogel in the target site without it flowing out into the 
surrounding tissue.
Gelatin hydrogel has already been used to clinically deliver 
bFGF to treat ischemic limb disease and Bell’s palsy [25,26]. The 
mechanisms by which bFGF facilitates periodontal regeneration 
are thought to include angiogenic activity and a mitogenic effect 
on mesenchymal stem cells within the periodontal ligament [3]. 
We hypothesize that periodontal regeneration is promoted by 
the sustained release of bFGF from gelatin hydrogel. In addition, 
we suspect that gelatin plays a role as a scaffold in the early stage 
of periodontal tissue regeneration.In our clinical study, a marked 
improvement of the infrabony defect was observed at 6 months 
after treatment. The radiographic and clinical parameters were 
stable at 12 months after bFGF/ gelatin hydrogel treatment. It 
has been reported that the clinical parameters and radiographic 
findings were stable at 6 years after 0.3% bFGF treatment. This 
may have a higher capacity for new alveolar bone regeneration than 
other periodontal regenerative therapies [27].
Conclusion
We evaluated the clinical effects of the sustained release of bFGF 
from gelatin hydrogel for the treatment of periodontal disease with 
infrabony defects. We treated 23 subjects with a mucoperiosteal 
flap operation. At the time of surgery, each bone defect was filled 
with bFGF/gelatin hydrogel, and this treatment led to improved 
clinical parameters, specifically, clinical attachment gain, probing 
depth reduction, and radiographic bone fill. We conclude by 
suggesting that the topical application of bFGF/gelatin hydrogel 
in the treatment of chronic periodontitis with infrabony defects 
or furcations is safe, leads to improvement of clinical parameters, 
and offers promise as a new avenue for periodontal regeneration. 
Since limited human clinical data are available, more studies with 
randomized control will be needed to fully evaluate the potential 
of bFGF/gelatin hydrogels for ehancing periodontal regeneration.References
