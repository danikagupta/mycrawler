Economical and bio-friendly approaches are needed to remediate dye-contaminated wastewater from various industries. In this
study, a novel bacterial strain capable of decolorizing triarylmethane dyes was isolated from a textile wastewater treatment plant
in Greece. The bacterial isolate was identiﬁed as Aeromonas hydrophila and was shown to decolorize three triarylmethane dyes
tested within 24 h with color removal in the range of 72% to 96%. Decolorization e ﬃciency of the bacterium was a function of
operational parameters (aeration, dye concentration, temper ature, and pH) and the optimal operational conditions obtained
for decolorization of the dyes were: pH 7-8, 35◦C and culture agitation. E ﬀective color removal within 24 h was obtained at
a maximum dye concentration of 50 mg/L. Dye decolorization was monitored using a scanning UV/visible spectrophotometer
which indicated that decolorization was due to the degradation of dyes into non-colored intermediates. Phytotoxicity studies
carried out using Triticum aestivum ,Hordeum vulgare, and Lens esculenta revealed the triarylmethane dyes exerted toxic e ﬀects on
plant growth parameters monitored. However, signiﬁcant reduction in toxicity was obtained with the decolorized dye metabolitesthus, indicating the detoxiﬁcation of the dyes following degradation by Aeromonas hydrophila .
1. Introduction
Worldwide, dye wastewater has become one of the main
sources of severe pollution problems due to the greater
demand for textile products and the proportional increasein production and applications of synthetic dyes [ 1]. It
is estimated that over 10,000 di ﬀerent dyes and pigments
are used industrially and over 0.7 million tons of synthetic
dyes are produced annually worldwide [ 2]. In the textile
industry, up to 200,000 tons of these dyes are lost to e ﬄuents
every year during dyeing and ﬁnishing operations as a result
of ine ﬃciency in the dyeing process [ 3,4]. Unfortunately,
most of these dyes escape conventional wastewater treatment
processes and persist in the environment as a result of theirhigh stability against light, temperature, water, detergents,chemicals, and microbial attack [ 5]. Notwithstanding, indus-
tries are required to eliminate color from their e ﬄuentscontaining dyes, before disposal into water bodies, due to
environmental legislation [ 6].
Among the many di ﬀerent groups of synthetic dyes,
triarylmethane (also called triphenylmethane) dyes are oneof the most commonly used in the textile industries. Theirusage constitutes about 30%–40% of the total consumptionof dyes [ 7], and they are applied extensively on nylon, cotton,
wool, and silk. They are also used for coloring food, oils,
fats, waxes, varnishes, cosmetics, paper, leather, and plastics[8] as well as for staining specimens in bacteriological
and histopathological processes. With dye tinctorial valueusually high, less than 1 ppm of dye in water producesobvious coloration [ 9], and the extensive use of these
dyes have resulted in highly colored e ﬄuents that may
aﬀect gas solubility in water bodies [ 10] and signiﬁcantly
decrease photosynthetic activity in aquatic life because ofreduced light penetration. In addition to their visual e ﬀect,2 Biotechnology Research International
triarylmethane dyes are generally believed to be toxic and
carcinogenic or prepared from other known carcinogens[11,12]. Several reports have also shown that textile dyes
and e ﬄuents have toxic e ﬀects on plants which perform
important ecological functions such as providing a habitatfor wildlife, protecting soil from erosion, and providing the
organic matter that is so signiﬁcant to soil fertility [ 13].
Consequently, it is pertinent to develop e ﬃcient treatment
strategies for removal of color from dye wastewater.
Various physicochemical methods, such as adsorption
on activated carbon, electrocoagulation, ﬂocculation, frothﬂotation, ion exchange, membrane ﬁltration, ozonation, andreverse osmosis have been used for decolorization of dyes inwastewater [ 2,14]. However, these methods are less e ﬃcient,
costly, of limited applicability, and produce wastes, whichare di ﬃcult to dispose of [ 15]. On the contrary, biological
processes provide a low-cost, environmentally benign, andeﬃcient alternative for the treatment of dye wastewater [ 16].
Decolorization by biological means may take place in
two ways: either by adsorption (or biosorption) on themicrobial biomass or biodegradation by the cells [ 17].
Biosorption involves the entrapment of dyes in the matrixof the adsorbent (microbial biomass) without destruction ofthe pollutant, whereas in biodegradation, the original dyestructure is fragmented into smaller compounds resultingin the decolorization of synthetic dyes. Several researchershave described the use of microorganisms as biosorptionagents in the removal of pollutants from wastewater [ 18–
20]. However, due to operational ease and facile adapt-
ability of microorganisms to a given set of conditions,
the biodegradation mechanism is considered e ﬃcacious in
comparison to biosorption for treatment of dye wastewater[21]. Over the past few decades, numerous microorganisms
have been isolated and characterized for degradation ofvarious synthetic dyes, but most of the reports have dealtmainly with decolorization of azo dyes [ 22–24]. There is
a dearth of information regarding the degradation anddetoxiﬁcation of triarylmethane dyes by microbial systemsdespite their increased use by the textile industry. Hence,the isolation of potent species that have the capability fordegradation and detoxiﬁcation of triarylmethane dyes isof interest in the biotechnological aspect of dye e ﬄuent
treatment.
In this study, a bacterial strain, Aeromonas hydrophila ,
capable of decolorizing triarylmethane dyes was isolatedfrom textile industrial wastewater using the selective enrich-ment method. The e ﬀects of various parameters (such
as culture agitation, initial dye concentration, pH, andtemperature) on dye decolorization by the bacterial strainwere investigated and the toxicity of the products formedafter decolorization was determined using plant assay.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Chemicals. The triarylmethane dyes (Basic violet 14,
Basic violet 3, and Acid blue 90) used in this study werepurchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo, USA).The chemical structures and characteristics of the dyes usedare depicted in Ta bl e 1 . The stock solutions of each dye were
prepared by membrane ﬁltration. All other chemicals usedwere of analytical grade.
2.2. Bacteria and Growth Medium. The bacterial strain used
was isolated from dye wastewater obtained from T extileof Thessaloniki, SA, Greece. The principle of sequentialselective enrichment batch culture for selection of dyedecolorizing bacteria was employed in synthetic wastewatermedium (SWM) with Basic Violet 3 as the carbon source.The basic composition of the synthetic wastewater mediumwas (g/L); (NH

MgSO 4·7H 2O 0.04, CaCl 2·2H 2O 0.022, FeCl 3·6H 2O 0.005,
NaCl 0.15, NaHCO 31.0, and 1 mL/L of a trace element solu-
tion containing (g/L); ZnSO 4·7H 2O 0.01, MnCl 2·4H 2O0 . 1 ,
CuSO 4·5H 2O 0.392, CoCl 2·6H 2O 0.248, NaB 4O7·10H 2O
0.177, and NiCl 2·6H 2O 0.02. The textile wastewater used
for isolation of dye-decolorizing bacteria was acclimatizedfor 8 weeks prior to transfer into 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂaskscontaining 100 mL SWM. After incubation of the ﬂasks, amixed culture that showed quick and stable decolorizationactivity was transferred to newly prepared SWM. After ﬁvesuccessive transfers, it was plated on SWM agar containing20 mg/L of each dye and incubated at 30

terial colonies around which clear zones expanded quicklywere picked for further studies and designated as TTW 1–5.T o check for the dye-degrading potential of each bacterialisolate, preliminary batch experiments were carried out usingsterile 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 100 mL of SWMspiked with dye, after which the solution was inoculatedwith freshly grown bacterial cells. The ﬁnal pH was 7.2.The bacterial isolate that showed the highest ability todegrade the triarylmethane dyes was selected and used forsubsequent investigations. The selected bacterium (TTW 4)was characterized and identiﬁed as Aeromonas hydrophila
using Gram stain, spore test, motility test, and a battery ofbiochemical and physiological tests ( Ta bl e 2 )a sd e s c r i b e db y

and with reference to the Bergey’s Manual of Determinative
Bacteriology [ 27].
2.3. Batch Decolorization Operation. The decolorization of
the triarylmethane dyes was studied in 250 mL Erlenmeyerﬂasks containing 100 mL of SWM and bacterial biomassin a batch mode. Each ﬂask was inoculated with 2 mL of
freshly grown Aeromonas hydrophila . The inoculum size
was adjusted at optical density 1.0 at λ
=620 nm (1.50 ×
107cells/mL) and incubated under shaking (150 rpm) and
static conditions at 30◦C. T o evaluate the e ﬀects of other
operational factors on the e ﬃciency of color removal,
the batch decolorization experiments were carried out atdiﬀerent initial dye concentrations (1–100 mg/L), temper-
atures (15
◦C–45◦C) and initial pH (4–10) under shaking
incubation condition. Thereafter, optimal conditions of 35◦C
and pH 7 and initial dye concentration of 50 mg/L were usedin subsequent experiments under shaking condition. Threetypes of control were used: uninoculated sterile control,heat-killed control, and sodium azide (0.1% w/v) amendedBiotechnology Research International 3

on decolorization, and the latter two showed adsorption ofdyes on cells. After incubation, aliquots (5 mL) were takenand centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to separate thebacterial cell mass and obtain a clear supernatant, which wasused to measure the absorbance of culture samples at themaximum absorption wavelength ( λ
max) of the respective
dyes using a scanning spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401 PC model Kyoto, Japan). Residual dye concentrationof samples was then obtained from a calibration curve ofdye concentration versus absorbance prepared for each dye.Decolorization activity was determined by using adsorption(A) and dye removal by living biomass ( R)w h i c hw e r e

the residual concentration (mg/L) of dye in samples withliving biomass. Enumeration of bacterial counts in cultureﬂasks was carried out on plate count agar (Merck) after
10-fold serial dilution of culture samples using the spread-plate method. Viable cell counts obtained after incubationfor 24 h at 35
◦C were expressed as colony-forming units per
mL (CFU/mL).
2.4. Toxicity Study. Phytotoxicity studies were carried out
with 50 mg/L of each dye and its extracted metabolitesusing seeds of Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare and Lens
esculenta with SWM as control. The degradation metabolites
of each dye extracted in ethyl acetate were dried and dissolved
in water to form the ﬁnal concentration of 50 mg/L for
phytotoxicity studies [ 12]. The seeds were surface sterilized
with 1.2% sodium hypochloride solution to discouragefungal growth. Fifteen seeds of each plant species were placedin each Petri dish in sets and watered separately with 5 mLsamples of each dye and its degradation product per day.The Petri dishes were kept in the dark and observed forgermination. Seeds with radicle ( >1 mm) were considered
germinated [ 29]. The germinated seeds were then exposed
to day and night cycle length of 10/14 h, respectively, witha temperature regime of about 28
±2◦C. The length of
plumule (shoot) and radicle (root), and the germination rate(%) were recorded after 7 days.4 Biotechnology Research International

2.5. Statistical Analysis. Data presented are means of three

iments. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance(ANOV A), with the Dunett post hoc test to check for interac-tive e ﬀects between factors [ 30]. The signiﬁcance level was set
at 5%.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Isolation of Dye-Degrading Bacteria. Five bacterial iso-
lates that exhibited dye decolorization potentials on SWM
agar spiked with Basic violet 3 were picked and screenedfor their ability to degrade three triarylmethane dyes (Basicviolet 14, Basic violet 3 and Acid blue 90). The bacterialisolates decolorized the three dyes albeit to varying degrees(Ta bl e 3 ) within 24 h, and further decolorization of the dyes
by the isolates was obtained after 36 h. The variation indecolorization e ﬃciency of the isolates may be attributed to
diﬀerences in the chemical structure of the dyes [ 10]a n d
the varying metabolic functions of the di ﬀerent bacterial
isolates. Decolorization of the dyes by the isolates was foundto be due to degradation to a greater extent than adsorptionas % adsorption obtained were quite low compared to %dye reduction by viable cells. Isolate TTW 4 did not showany evidence of adsorption after 24 h. Adsorption and/ordegradation are the two mechanisms responsible for dyedecolorization by microorganisms. Dye adsorption may beevident from inspection of the bacterial growth as thoseadsorbing dyes will be deeply colored, whereas those causingdegradation will remain colorless. While the isolate TTW4 cells cultured for 8 h with the dyes were colored, noneof the cells was colored with any one of the dyes testedafter incubation and decolorization for 24 h. Decolorizationassay of a butanol extract of the cell pellets after incubation
for 24 h with the dyes showed that the dyes were not
adsorbed to the cell (data not shown). This indicates thatdecolorization of the dyes was mainly due to degradationrather than adsorption to cells. The deeply colored cell matsafter 8 h may be explained by the fact that adsorption isfrequently the ﬁrst step of the biodegradation process beforetransportation of dye into the cytoplasm and its eventualbreakdown by viable microbial cells. However, adsorptionlevels most times are an indication of biotransformationeﬃciency or its absence as rapid dye biodegraders rarely show
high adsorption rates upon decolorization and incubationfor an extended time period. In another experiment carriedout using viable, autoclaved (killed), and metabolicallyBiotechnology Research International 5

poisoned cells of isolate TTW 4, dye decolorization was
below 4.5% for the killed and poisoned cells while theviable cells exhibited color removal ranging from 54%–78%(Ta bl e 4 ). Hence, color removal exhibited by viable cells was
attributed to the biotransformation of these dyes by themetabolic functions of the bacterium. Prior to now, variousauthors [ 31,32] had reported the isolation of a gene ( tmr)
encoding the enzyme, triphenylmethane reductase (TpmD),from bacteria, and we believe that this enzyme may beresponsible for the bioconversion of the dyes tested. Thevisual change in biomass color of the killed and poisonedcells and their resuspension in methanol showed that the
slight decolorization of their culture medium observed was
due to adsorption of dyes on bacterial cells. Decolorization(adsorption) by dead cells may be due to the increase of thecell wall area that ruptured during autoclaving and may alsobe attributed to the revealing of special sites on cell walls[33]. Based on results, isolate TTW 4 which was identiﬁed
asAeromonas hydrophila was selected as having the best dye
decolorization potential, since it showed little or no sorptionof the three dyes and exhibited rapid decolorization of dyeswithin 24 h. TTW 4 was, thus, considered a good candidatefor e ﬀective biological treatment of textile wastewater and
used for further studies.
3.2. E ﬀect of Agitation on Decolorization. The isolate,
A. hydrophila, exhibited e ﬀective color removal activity only
when incubated under shaking condition, whereas poordecolorization ( <30%) for the three dyes was obtained
under static condition ( Figure 1 ). Under agitated condition,
decolorization percentages of dyes were 90%, 75%, and 66%for Basic violet 14, Basic violet 3, and Acid blue 90, respec-tively, within 24 h of incubation. Incubation under agitatedcondition was also necessary for better cell growth in contrast

to incubation under static condition (data not shown). Poor
decolorization of the dyes obtained under static conditioncould be attributed to the limitation of oxygen needed forthe oxidative breakdown of the triarylmethane moiety, sinceenhanced decolorization was obtained when static cultures
were subsequently incubated under agitated condition. A.
hydrophila also exhibited maximum decolorization of dyes
when 0.02% (w/v) yeast extract, starch or other carbonsources were supplemented in the medium (data notshown). In absence of a cosubstrate, the bacterial cultureshowed reduced decolorization rates which suggested thatthe availability of a supplementary carbon source probablyfor generation of NADH molecules seems to be necessaryfor growth and decolorization of dyes. A previous report[34] had shown that both NADH/NADPH and molecular
oxygen are necessary for the enzyme TpmD to decolorizetriphenylmethane dyes which indicated that the enzyme isan NADH/NADPH-dependent oxygenase. T extile industrial6 Biotechnology Research International

wastewaters usually contain sizing agents such as starch,
polyvinyl alcohol (PV A) and carboxymethyl cellulose addedduring sizing to provide strength to the ﬁbers and minimizebreakage [ 1], and these substances may serve as cosubstrates
for bacteria during e ﬄuent treatment for the generation of
NADH molecules.
3.3. E ﬀect of Initial Dye Concentration on Decolorization.
The decolorization of dyes was studied at various increasinginitial concentrations of each dye (1–100 mg/L). Resultsobtained show complete decolorization of dyes at initial con-centrations between 1 and 20 mg/L within 24 h ( Figure 2 ).
However, decrease in % decolorization with increase indye concentration was obtained at concentrations above20 mg/L. Decolorization percentages of 90, 78, and 65 wereobtained for Basic violet 14, Basic violet 3, and Acid blue90, respectively, at 50 mg/L initial dye concentration, andthis indicates that an acceptable high color removal canbe achieved with A. hydrophila in culture broths with dye
concentrations below 50 mg/L. For industrial applications,it is important to know whether the microorganisms that
decolorize dyes can bear high concentrations of the com-
pound since the dye concentration in a typical industrialeﬄuent can vary between 10 and 50 mg/L [ 35].A. hydrophila
could decolorize the dyes at concentrations higher thanthose reported in waste waters and thus, it can be suc-cessfully exploited for treatment of dye bearing industrialwaste waters. Zablocka-Godlewska et al. [ 28]h a dr e p o r t e d
that Chryseomonas luteola (42% removal) and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (40.5% removal) had the ability to decolorize
50 mg/L concentration of triphenylmethane dyes within 7days. In comparison, our test isolate A. hydrophila showed
65%–90% decolorization of 50 mg/L of the triarylmethanedyes tested within 24 h ( Figure 2 ). These results show thatBasic violet 14

A. hydrophila has a higher decolorization potential compared
to the other bacteria reported previously. Decreased %
decolorization of dyes obtained at higher concentrations
suggests increasing dye toxicity with increase in dosage. T oxiceﬀect was probably due to inhibition of cellular metabolic
activities and cell growth. Several authors have also reported
decreasing color removal with increasing dye concentration
during decolorization of other dyes by bacteria [ 22,36,37].
3.4. E ﬀects of Temperature and pH. In the experiments
carried out at di ﬀerent temperatures, the initial dye con-
c e n t r a t i o na n dp Hw e r eﬁ x e da t5 0 m g / La n d7r e s p e c t i v e l y ,
and the temperature e ﬀect was investigated at the range
of 15
◦C–45◦C. Results show that the temperature e ﬀect
on decolorization was signiﬁcant over the examined range
(Figure 3 ) as dye decolorization increased as the temperature
was elevated to 40◦C. On further incubation, the same % dye
decolorization was eventually reached in all ﬂasks incubatedat di ﬀerent temperatures suggesting the test isolate could
acclimatize to a broad range of temperatures (15
◦C–40◦C).
The optimal temperature for bacterial activity was 35◦C
(Figure 3 ) and further increase in temperature beyond that
resulted in marginal reduction in dye decolorization butessentially, thermal deactivation of decolorization activity
under operational temperatures did not occur. Decline in
bacterial activity at higher temperatures ( >45
◦C) may be
attributed to loss of cell viability or denaturation of thecatabolic enzyme [ 37,38]. Determination of temperature
requirements of microorganisms used for biotechnologicalapplications is paramount, since temperature requirementsabove-ambient ranges may require an energy input andhence not cost e ﬀective.
Eﬀect of initial pH on the biodegradation e ﬃciency of the
isolate was analyzed over a pH range of 4 to 11 ( Figure 4 ).Biotechnology Research International 7

T o conﬁrm if pH had any e ﬀect on decolorization of the
dyes at the pH range studied, the absorbance signatureof each dye was monitored at the di ﬀerent pH and no
change in the visible spectra was obtained at this pH range.The degree of color removal observed varied with pH asincrease in pH from 4 to 7 led to a threefold increase in% decolorization. Di ﬀerences in biodegradation e ﬃciency
were insigniﬁcant between pH 7 and 9. Below pH 4 andabove pH 10, negligible decolorization by this bacterium wasobserved. Though neutral pH (7) was best for degradation ofthe dyes, pH 9 appeared to be well tolerated and signiﬁcantamount of dye could be degraded at that pH, thus indicatingthe potential of this organism to degrade dyes over a rangeof pH. T olerance to varying pH by dye-decolorizing bacteriais quite important, as it makes them suitable for practicalbiotreatment of dyeing mill e ﬄuents [ 39,40]. However, to
achieve the best rate of degradation, it is suggested that
the pH of textile e ﬄuents be neutralized to 7. This trend
of decolorization dependence on pH has been reportedelsewhere [ 41,42]. They found that pH between 7 and 9
was optimum for decolorization of triphenylmethane dyes byPseudomonas otitidis WL-13. The e ﬀect of pH may be related
to the transport of dye molecules across the cell membrane,which is considered a rate limiting step for dye decolorization[38]. At pH below 4, H
+ions compete e ﬀectively with dye
cations, causing a decrease in color removal e ﬃciency, while
at higher pH above this point charge, the surface of biomassgets negatively charged, which attracts the positively chargeddye cations through electrostatic force of attraction [ 15].
3.5. UV-Visible Spectral Analysis. UV-visible spectral analysis
was used to conﬁrm that the decolorization process ofthe triarylmethane dyes was due to biodegradation. If dyeremoval is attributed to biodegradation, either the majorvisible light absorbance peak would completely disappear400 450 500 550 600 650 700Absorbance

the absorption spectrum will reveal that all peaks decreaseapproximately in proportion to each other. Examinationof spectral signatures of dyes indicated a decrease in theabsorbance of samples withdrawn after decolorization usingA. hydrophila (Figure 5 ). The absorbance peaks (at 0 h) of the
dyes drastically reduced albeit at di ﬀerent rates within 24 h
of incubation. No new absorbance peak appeared in samplesafter scanning following decolorization which indicates8 Biotechnology Research International

number was obtained with a concomitant decrease in dyeconcentration suggesting the utilization of the dyes by thebacterial cells for growth. Results obtained generally revealcolor removal by the test isolate was largely due to the
biodegradation of the dyes rather than adsorption.
The optimal operational conditions for degradation of
dyes by A. hydrophila were at pH 7-8 and incubation tem-
perature of 35
◦C. E ﬀective decolorization was obtained in
medium containing initial dye concentration of 50 mg/L or
less. Similar results have been obtained as optimal conditions
for degradation of azo and triphenylmethane dyes by otherresearchers [ 37,41,43].
The e ﬀectiveness of dye decolorization was connected
with dye chemical structure, molecular weight and thepresence of functional groups. Higher % decolorization wasobtained with Basic violet 14 and Basic violet 3 which hadlower molecular weights and simpler structures ( Ta bl e 1 ).
In the case of Acid blue 90, the relatively higher molecularweight (854.02), its complex structure and the presence ofsulphonic groups may be responsible for its lower biodegrad-ability. Dyes with sulphonic groups are usually highly polarcompounds [ 44], and this makes it di ﬃcult for them to
penetrate into the cells through the cell membrane. Theinﬂuence of dye structure on decolorization e ﬀectiveness had
been demonstrated in a previous report [ 41]. The bacterial
strain tested ( Citrobacter sp.), removed faster and more
eﬀectively structurally simpler Crystal violet and Methyl
red than more complicated Gentian violet, Malachite greenand Brilliant green. Similar dependence has been reportedelsewhere [ 31,45]. In our study, A. hydrophila showed
some advantages during dye decolorization such as robustgrowth property and simple growth requirements, whichmake it a potential strain for biotreatment of textile indus-
trial e ﬄuent. Moreover, A. hydrophila had previously been
shown to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) [ 4,
46,47]. PHA and PHBHHx are biopolymers which are accu-
mulated by microorganisms as carbon and energy reserves[48,49]. These biopolymers have material properties similar
to petrochemical plastics such as enhanced ﬂexibility andimproved impact strength, and yet, they are biodegradableand can be produced from carbon sources. The ability ofA. hydrophila to produce PHA and PHBHHx during dye
degradation should be explored as this may o ﬀer more
advantages in the use of A. hydrophila as a biotechnological
agent for generation of useful bioproducts during treatmentof wastewater.
3.6. Phytotoxicity Study. The disposal of untreated and
treated textile dye wastewater on land may have a directimpact on soil fertility and by extension agricultural produc-tivity. Thus, it was pertinent to assess the phytotoxicity of thedyes before and after degradation as environmental safetydemands both pollutant removal and their detoxiﬁcation.Phytotoxicity studies were carried out by evaluating therelative sensitivities of Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare,
and Lens esculenta toward the dyes and their degradation
products using seed germination and plant growth assays.Germination (%) of plant seeds was less with the raw dye
treatment when compared to the treatment with degradation
metabolites and SWM. The lengths of shoot, root, andBiotechnology Research International 9

seedling were also signiﬁcantly a ﬀected (T ables 5,6and 7)
by the three dyes than by their degradation metabolites,
indicating less toxic nature of degradation metabolites ascompared to dyes. Amongst the dyes, treatment with Basic
violet 14 showed the most toxic e ﬀect on seed germination
and plant growth parameters whereas, treatment with Acid
blue 90 exhibited the least toxic e ﬀect. However, for the
dye metabolites, treatment with Basic violet 3 showed themost toxic e ﬀect while Acid blue 90 exhibited the least toxic
eﬀect. Results indicate that e ﬀective dye decolorization does
not always result in reduction of dye toxicity since Basic
violet 3 was better decolorized than Acid blue 90. However,
toxicity exerted by the treated samples was generally lowerthan that obtained for the untreated samples. Before now,
most of the decolorization projects have concentrated mainly
on color removal while neglecting the fact that sometimesbiological processes are connected with formation of toxicintermediates. Hence, it is required that the evaluation
of decolorization e ﬀect be carried out with relation to
ecotoxicity assessment. In this study, phytotoxicity studieshave revealed that the biodegradation of triarylmethane dyes
byA. hydrophila resulted in their detoxiﬁcation and genera-
tion of nontoxic metabolites thus suggesting biotreated dye
wastewater can be used for irrigation.
4. Conclusions
There are very few reports on the biodegradation and
detoxiﬁcation of textile and dye-stu ﬀindustrial wastes
containing triarylmethane dyes. In this study, we describe
the isolation and characterization of a strain of Aeromonas
hydrophila capable of e ﬃciently degrading triarylmethane
dyes. The identity of the strain was conﬁrmed using morpho-
logical, physiological, and biochemical assays. Degradation10 Biotechnology Research International
of dyes by the isolate was found to be dependent on dye
concentration, aeration, pH, as well as temperature and
presence of a cosubstrate. Phytotoxicity tests carried out onthree plant species also indicated detoxiﬁcation of the dyes
after degradation as decolorized samples exhibited lower
toxic e ﬀects than the raw dyes. E ﬀective dye wastewater
treatment using this isolate will demand the optimization
of medium components and physicochemical conditions formaximum decolorization and detoxiﬁcation. The advantages
of this biological process are low cost, rapid degradation,
and simple handling and, hence, could be applied to treat
wastewater from dyeing and printing operations and in
bioremediation of dye contaminated environments. Thenext focus should be the design and scaling up of e ﬃcient
tailor-made bioreactors with immobilized bacteria for the
treatment of dye wastewater and to explore the potentials
of producing useful biopolymer products from A. hydrophila
during dye degradation.
