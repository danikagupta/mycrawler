The shewanellae are ubiquitous in aquatic and sedimentary system s that are chemically stratiﬁed on a permanent or seasonal basis.
In addition to their ability to utilize a diverse array of terminal electron acceptors, the microorganisms have evolved both common
and unique responding mechanisms to cope with various stresses. This paper focuses on the response and adaptive mechanism of
the shewanellae, largely based on transcriptional data.
1. Introduction
Stress is an inevitable part of the life of all organisms. This
is especially true about microorganisms, which reside andthrive in almost all environments on earth, including someconsidered extremely harsh [ 1]. Common environmental
factors that a ﬀect the activities of microorganisms include
temperature, pH, water availability, nutrient limitation, pres-ence of various chemicals, osmolarity, pressure, and radia-tion [ 2]. Consequently, for every microorganism the ability
to adapt rapidly to changes in environments is essential forits survival and prosperity. Regulation that modulates themicrobial adaptation to environmental disturbances is rathercomplex. The most important and e ﬃcient control occurs
at the level of transcription. Many single stress-inducedregulatory circuits have been identiﬁed, which enable cellsto cope with speciﬁc stresses. However, given that microbialcells live in a dynamic environment where multiple factorsﬂuctuate constantly at the same time, stress responses areg e n e r a l l yc a r r i e do u tb yar e g u l a t o r yn e t w o r kc o m p o s e do fa series of individual circuits which are highly connected [ 3].
Most of our understanding of microbial stress response
mechanisms has come from the study of model microor-ganisms, particularly Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis .
Extensive physiological and genetic analyses of the stressresponse systems in these two bacteria have helped us toelucidate the complexity of the process, function of criticalproteins, and regulation [ 4]. While model organisms will
continue to provide insights into the fundamental propertiesof the stress response systems, e ﬀorts should be extended to
other microorganisms, especially those that are of scientiﬁc,environmental, and economic importance.
As one of representatives, the family of Shewanellaceae
(order Alteromonadales, class γ-proteobacteria) is emerging
in recent years. The genus Shewanella consists of rod-shaped,
Gram-negative, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, polarlyﬂagellated, readily cultivated γ-proteobacteria [ 5–8]. While
many Shewanella isolates remain uncharacterized, 52 species
have been recognized to date [ 9]. Shewanellae are renowned
for its ability to use a diverse range of electron accep-tors for anaerobic respiration, including fumarate, nitrate,
nitrite, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, trimethylamine N-oxide
(TMAO), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Fe(III), Mn(III) and(IV), Cr(VI), U(VI), As(V), V(V), and others [ 10,11]. As
a result of this property, Shewanellae have drawn muchattention in the ﬁelds of bioremediation, biogeochemicalcirculation of minerals, and bioelectricity [ 12,13]. In
addition, Shewanellae have now served as the model forecological and evolutionary studies at the whole genome levelbecause of its diverse habitats and the availability of up to 26genome sequences [ 14,15].
An u m b e ro f Shewanella strains are currently under
physiological investigation [ 11]. However, stress responses
have focused nearly exclusively on Shewanella oneidensis , the
ﬁrst genome of the shewanellae to be sequenced [ 16]. The
availability of the genome sequence allowed developmentof high-throughput technologies such as microarrays andproteomics tools, with which an array of assays has been2 International Journal of Microbiology
carried out to decipher the ability of S. oneidensis to respond
to and survive external stresses. While impacts of mostof common environmental factors have been examined,oxidative stress imposed by H
2O2is surprisingly untouched.
In this paper, we consider all insights into the stress responsemechanisms revealed thus far in S. oneidensis and broaden
our discussion to other sequenced species if necessary.
2. Stress Responses to T emperature Fluctuation
Variation in growth temperature is a common stress encoun-
tered in nature. Stress response to sudden ﬂuctuationin growth temperature, has become a model system forstudying the impact of environmental stresses on biologicalsystems. The hallmark of this adaptive cellular response isthe induction of a limited set of proteins, called Heat shockproteins (Hsps) or Cold shock proteins (Csps). In general,Hsps play important roles in protein folding, degradation,assembly of protein complexes, and transport of proteinsacross membranes whereas Csps function as RNA chaperonsto regulate ribosomal translation, rate of mRNA degradationand termination of transcription [ 17–19].
Using whole-genome DNA microarrays, temporal gene
expression proﬁles of S. oneidensis MR-1 in response to tem-
perature variations have been investigated [ 20,21]. Expres-
sion proﬁles indicate that temperature ﬂuctuation has apleiotropic e ﬀect on the bacterial transcriptomes. Both heat
and cold shock responses appear to share a couple ofcommon features, including that approximately 15% of thetotal genes are signiﬁcantly a ﬀected ( P<0.05) over a 25-
min period, that the global changes in mRNAs are rapidand transient, and that a similar set of proteins are inducedto manage energy production and protein damage. Forinstance, most of genes encoding enzymes in the Entner-Doudoro ﬀpathway and the pentose cycle are highly induced
upon a temperature alteration.
In the case of heat shock response, two lines of evidence
suggest that S. oneidensis copes with the situation with
mechanism similar to that employed by E. coli . First, the
majority of the genes that showed homology to knownHsps in E. coli such as DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, GroES, GrpE,
HtpG, and Lon/La proteases were highly induced. Second,the identiﬁed σ
32consensus sequences (CTTGAAA-13/15bp-
CCCCAT) of both bacteria for heat shock gene promoters arevirtually the same ( Figure 1 ), indicating that the induction
of most Hsps owns to a rapid and transient increase in the
intracellular concentration of an alternative σfactor,σ
32
encoded by rpoH . Nevertheless, novel ﬁndings are not scarce.
After numerous attempts, we failed to remove rpoH from
the genome, implicating that σ32is essential in S. oneidensis
(unpublished result). Additionally, some hypothetical pro-teins (i.e., SO2017) are under the control of σ
32, suggesting
that S. oneidensis recruits new proteins to overcome increased
temperature ( Table 1 ).
Unlike E. coli ,m o s t Shewanella strains are psychrotol-
erant. In terms of the canonical Csps S. oneidensis pos-
sesses three (of which two (SO1648 and SO2787) are coldinducible) whereas E. coli has nine (of which four are cold
inducible) [ 19]. Both SO1648 and SO2787 are importantin growth at low temperatures evidenced in the mutational
analysis [ 21]. The S. oneidensis genome carries two more
genes encoding Csd(cold shock domain)-containing proteins(SO0733, 203 aa; SO1732, 224 aa) whose C-terminal lackssequence similarity to any known proteins. Intriguingly,such a structure has been found only in eukaryotes, with
the exception of Mycobacterium [24]. Neither SO0733 nor
SO1732 is found to be induced upon a decrease in tempera-ture or inﬂuences growth at low temperature, indicating thatthese Csd-containing proteins may not be involved in coldstress response.
S. piezotolerans WP3 is another Shewanella that has
been studied in respect of response to low temperatures.Strikingly, none of its Csps are cold inducible, suggestingthat these proteins may not play an indispensible role in theprocess [ 25]. Instead, the organism utilizes other strategies to
overcome temperature downshifts. These include increasedproduction of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and BCFA(branched-chain fatty acid) [ 26], induced expression of RNA
helicase DeaD which may facilitate transcription, morpho-logical changes in cell membrane, and elevated assembly oflateral ﬂagella (The organism possesses both polar and lateralﬂagella.) [ 25]. In addition, a novel ﬁlamentous phage (SW1)
is found to be signiﬁcantly induced at low temperature butthe signiﬁcance of this event in the cold adaptation of S.
piezotolerans WP3 is unknown [ 27].
3. Stress Responses to Acidic and Alkaline pH
Microorganisms live in a volatile environment where extra-
cellular pH changes frequently. T o minimize the acid- oralkaline-induced damage, various adaptive strategies haveevolved [ 28,29]. Studies on E. coli have revealed that
bacterial cells activate outward H
+pumps such as K+/proton
antiporters in response to acute cytoplasmic acidiﬁcationand sodium proton antiporters, which bring in 2 H
+for each
Na+extruded, to adapt to alkaline pH in the presence of
Na+. T o survive upon prolonged acid stress exposure, cells
rely on the arginine and glutamate decarboxylase/antiportersystems, which are thought to counteract external acidiﬁca-tion through the consumption of intracellular protons andthe generation of alkaline amines. Additional acid toleranceresponses include regulation of proton permeability byinduction of membrane proteins and lipid modiﬁcationenzyme. In the case of alkaline stress, amino acid metabolicenzymes such as tryptophan deaminase (TnaA) and o-
acetylserine sulfhydrylase A (CysK) are induced to reverse
alkalinization by metabolizing amino acids to produce acidicproducts.
The response of S. oneidensis to acid and alkaline stresses
intersects with other stresses evidenced by elevated expres-sion of RpoS, a central regulator of stationary-phase geneexpression [ 30]. It is reasonable to speculate that S. oneidensis
cells upon altered pH mimic those at the stationary phase.In respect of response to acidic pH, the mechanism ofS. oneidensis is fundamentally di ﬀerent from that of E.
coli. The most important and e ﬀective player of E. coli in
mediating acid resistance is the glutamate-dependent (Gad)system, which is missing in all sequenced Shewanellae [31].International Journal of Microbiology 3

Figure 1: Comparison of consensus σ32-recognition sequences of E. coli and S. oneidensis .T h e E. coli and S. oneidensis sequences used were
from the published reports by Nonaka et al. [ 22] and Gao et al. [ 20], respectively. The sequences were initially aligned by clustalx and the
sequence logo was prepared using public software at http://www.bioinf.ebc.ee/EP/EP/SEQLOGO/ .
Additionally, none of genes encoding H+ex-pumps are
found to be induced. Instead, proteins showing substantialinduction are rather diverse, including those functioning incell envelope structure (e.g., csggenes), glycogen biosynthesis
(glg operon), fatty acid metabolism ( fadBA ), glutamate
synthesis ( gltBD ), phosphate transport ( so1724 and pstB-
1), and regulation (e.g., rpoS and phoU ). This observation
indicates that the molecular e ﬀects of acute acidic pH
are profound and multifarious. Upon alkaline pH, as inE. coli Na
+/H+antiporter systems (NhaA) are particularly
important in maintaining a pH-homeostatic mechanism,
thus enabling S. oneidensis to survive and adapt to external
alkaline conditions.
4. Stress Responses to Osmolarity
The bacterial response to hypertonic stress includes a rangeof mechanisms. The most important one is regulation ofaquaporins in the outer membrane for water intake by thestationary-phase sigma factor, RpoS [ 32]. It is common that
upon the stress condition K
+uptake is activated and K+ions
are maintained at high levels. Additionally, cells accumulate
neutral, polar, small molecules, such as glycine betaine
(GB), proline, trehalose, or ectoine [ 33]. These compatible
solutes serve as osmoprotectants and are synthesized and/orimported into the cell. Many Shewanella species are marine
microorganisms and therefore are naturally tolerant torelatively high levels of salt. Although some like S. oneidensis ,
are obtained from freshwater environments, they are able togrow in the presence of up to 0.6 M NaCl [ 34].
The primary response of S. oneidensis to hyperosmotic
conditions is similar to E. coli . Genes encoding K
+uptake
proteins, Na+eﬄux system components, and glutamate
synthesis are found to be highly induced. Nonetheless, somenovel mechanisms are observed. Genes encoding proteinsinvolved in accumulation of compatible osmolytes are either
missing in the genome or transcriptionally una ﬀected when
encountered stress. Interestingly, genes encoding TCA cycleare particularly active, probably producing much neededATP for ion transport. This may also explain that S. onei-
densis shows reduced motility and chemotaxis responding
capability under the stress given that the assembly of ﬂagellais extremely energy consuming [ 34].
5. Stress Responses to Radiation
Radiation is potentially lethal and mutagenic to all organ-
isms. Although DNA is the major chromophore in general,eﬀects of radiation are in fact pleiotropic [ 35,36].S.
oneidensis , one of the most radiation-sensitive organisms
known so far, is approximately 1 order of magnitude moresusceptible to all wavelengths of solar UV , UV , and ionizingradiation than E. coli [35,37–40]. This is strikingly because
the organism similar to E. coli possesses the complete set of
genes for photo-reactivation, and nucleotide excision repair,and SOS response, primary mechanisms that protect cellsfrom DNA damages and radiation-induced oxidative stress
[16,41,42]. All of these S. oneidensis genes appear to be
functional and crucial in the cellular response to radiation,supported by signiﬁcant upregulation in transcriptionalanalyses. It is interesting to note that Shewanella strains
vary signiﬁcantly in their susceptibility to radiation althoughcompared to E. coli they are still much less resistant. The
general trend is that the more radiation exposure is in thehabitat where the organisms are isolated the less sensitivethey are [ 37]. For instance, S. oneidensis MR-1 from lake
sediment and S. putrefaciens 200 from a crude oil pipeline
are more sensitive to radiation than S. algae from the surface
of a red alga and S. oneidensis MR-4 from the surface of the
Black Sea [ 33].4 International Journal of MicrobiologyTable 1: Genes predicted to be under the direct control of σ32inS. oneidensis.

It has been suggested that the hypersensitivity to radia-
tion may be in part due to the activation of prophage [ 38–
40]. Radiation has been used as a standard approach to
i n d u c ep r o p h a g ei nav a r i e t yo fb a c t e r i a[ 43,44]. In S. onei-
densis , upon radiation the majority of LambdaSo, MuSo1,
and MuSo2 genes are induced and phage particles have been
found in the cultures, indicating that a great number of
cells are lysed by lytic phages. It has also been implicatedthat a large number of iron-containing proteins may bepartially accountable for the susceptibility. Compared to E.
coliwhich hosts only ﬁve to seven cytochrome cproteins,
S. oneidensis contains 41 such proteins, some of which are
electron transport proteins and essential in respiration [ 45,
46]. Damages on these proteins by reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generated in cells upon radiation would likely causetwo detrimental results [ 47]. First, damaged proteins per se
may be dysfunctional, directly reducing ability to survive orthrive. Second, damaged proteins release irons into cultures,which further induce ROS production [ 48]. This second
wave of ROS may be more fatal because it comes at theonset of recovery of seriously damaged cells. Furthermore,the ﬁnding that the intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratioscorrelate well with resistance to radiation may explain thehypersensitivity of S. oneidensis , which has the lowest ratio
among bacteria tested so far [ 35,49].
6. Stress Responses to Heave Metals
Many of metal elements are required for microbial growth
mostly as cofactors in metabolic pathways. However, theyexert deleterious e ﬀects under conditions of elevated con-
centration [ 50].Shewanellae have attracted much attention
because of their ability to reduce metal ions includingchromium, cobalt, iron, manganese, technetium, uranium,and vanadium, some of which are not needed and highlytoxic for most organisms [ 10,51,52]. At the low level these
metal ions are taken as electron acceptors by cells and mildlyinduced some stress-associated genes [ 53]. However, at the
high concentration some of them elicited a distinctivelydiﬀerent pattern [ 54–60]. The cellular resistance mecha-
nisms displayed by microorganisms are diverse and includebiosorption, diminished intracellular accumulation througheither direct obstruction of the ion uptake system or activechromate e ﬄux, precipitation, and reduction of metals to less
toxic form. Multiple regulatory circuits are found to worktogether to cope with the stress response of S. oneidensis
to heavy metal compounds. The major ones include those
modulating oxidative stress protection, detoxiﬁcation, pro-tein stress protection, iron acquisition, and DNA repair [ 50].
The molecular response of S. oneidensis to heavy metal
shock elicits a distinctively di ﬀerent transcriptional proﬁle
compared with metal reduction [ 53–60]. This observation is
consistent with that metal reduction and toxicity resistancemechanisms are to be unlinked cellular processes [ 61].
Responses of S. oneidensis to acute stresses imposed by a
variety of heavy metals share a common strategy: survive ﬁrstand then exert both general and speciﬁc stress responses. Asa result, S. oneidensis up-regulates its resistance-nodulation-
cell division (RND) protein family genes that facilitate cationexport and thus confer heavy metal resistance. Once the
ﬁrst line of defense is initiated, cells employ both generaland speciﬁc stress responses that are inseparable from eachother to recover from the crisis. Alternative sigma factorsincluding RpoS, RpoH, RpoE, along with stress-response-related genes are induced, leading to induction of a variety
of detoxiﬁcation, resistance, and transport functions. Such
coordinated expression of stress response and detoxiﬁcationmechanisms in S. oneidensis may o ﬀer an advantage to thrive
in anoxic metal-reducing conditions in aquatic sediment andsubmerged soil systems where substantial amounts of heavymetals can be generated.
Two speciﬁc responding mechanisms are particularly
worth noting. The ﬁrst is that genes/proteins involved iniron transport are transcriptionally active and implicated toplay an important role in the process. Although inductionof siderophore biosynthetic and iron transport genes maynot be a direct consequence of intracellular iron limitation,several lines of evidence suggest that it is more likely to beindirect by interfering with the Fur (ferric uptake regulator)protein, which eventually results in derepression of theiron regulon. Several reports have demonstrated that Co
2+,
Mn2+, or other divalent cations interact with the Fur-binding
sites [ 62,63]. Moreover, iron-chelating siderophores from
other microorganisms have been shown to be able to bindother metals, such as thorium, uranium, vanadium, andplutonium [ 64,65]. By increasing siderophore production,
cells can reduce toxicity of heavy metals by sequestration.The other is that sulfur transport and assimilation ispromoted. While the underlying mechanism is currently
unknown, an explanation is o ﬀered. In S. oneidensis ,r e a c t i v e
oxygen species (ROS) produced in cells by heavy metalstresses can damage iron-containing proteins. As cysteineresidues in these proteins are essential to their functions,an extra mount of cysteine is needed for protection. T o thisend, cells elevate transportation of inorganic sulfate whichis reduced and incorporated into bioorganic compounds viaassimilatory sulfate reduction, which is the major route ofcysteine biosynthesis in most microorganisms [ 66].
7. Concluding Remarks
As a potential strategy for the reductive immobilization
or detoxiﬁcation of environmental contaminants, in situ
bioremediation has received much interest and attentionin last 20 years and are becoming more prevalent today.
As its intrinsic feature, the application puts its work force,
mostly bacteria, “ in situ ” facing the unpredictability of
individual microbial processes and constant ﬂuctuations inenvironments. Thanks to the availability of the S. oneidensis
genome sequence, stress responses of the microorganismhave been extensively investigated, generating a handful ofinsights into mechanisms adopted to cope with detrimentalconditions. Nonetheless, adaptive mechanisms of Shewanella
to environmental stresses are still a large playing ﬁeld forthree reasons. First, a number of common stressful agents,especially reactive oxygen species, are not visited. Second,the complex components and regulation in the bacterialstress responses discussed in this paper are mostly based on6 International Journal of Microbiology
transcriptional proﬁling and thus experimental validation
is urgently warranted. Last, but deﬁnitely not the least, thegenus is composed of members which are not only isolatedfrom extremely diverse habitats but also lack unifyingphenotypic features, prompting exploration to be extendedto other ecological groups of the Shewanellae.
