Abstract : The textile industry, by far the most frequent user of synthetic dyes, is in need of ecologically 
efficient solutions for its colored wastewaters. White -rot basidiomycetes are among the most potent 
organisms to biodegrade and detoxify a wide range of pollutants and synthetic dyes,  enabled  by 
ligninolytic enzymes, namely, laccases. Present study was undertaken to explore white- rot fungi 
Trametes versicolor and Fomes fomentarius  for their laccase production and potential in dye 
decolorization. The laccase production was induced by 0.5 mM copper sulphate and their effectity in  
decolorization of five types of synthetic textile dyes (N -heterocyclic, azo, triphenylmethane and 
triarylmethane) was studied. The most effective laccase decolorization was observed for the dyes 
Malachite G reen and B romothymol Blue  using 0.5 mM copper  as inducer for both fungi .  
Key Words:  Decolorization , copper inducer , laccase, Trametes versicolor, Fomes fomentarius  
INTRODUCTION  
Wastewater from textile industries is characterized by high concentration of chemical s suspended 
solids and intens ively  color ed aromatic structure due to the extensive use of synthetic dyes and pigments. 
Based on the chemical structure of the chromophor e group, these dyes are classified as azo, 
anthraquinone, triphenylmethane, heterocyclic and polymeric dyes ( Yang et al. 2009 ). 
Typically, these dyes are removed by chemical and physical methods like adsorption, 
coagulation- flocculation, oxidation, filtration and electrochemical treatments. All these methods have 
different color removal capabi lities, capital costs and operating speed. However , these methods create 
huge amounts of sludge which become a pollutant on its own creating disposal problems and can cause 
the formation of toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic breakdown products. There is a gr eat need to develop 
an economic and effective way of dealing with the textile dyeing waste at the level of the industry itself 
in the face of the ever increasing production activities.  
Biological treatment using white -rot fungi have been demonstrated to be capable of transforming, 
mineralizing and removing of a wide range of organopollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons, chlorophenols and polychlorinated biphenyls and various azo, heterocyclic and 
polymeric  dyes due to containing rich ligninolytic enzymatic system. The most important enzyme is 
laccase (Lac, E.C. 1.10.3.2), which is a multicopper enzyme, which catalyses the oxidation of phenolic 
and non- phenolic compounds and belongs to the group of phenol oxidases.  
However, ligninolytic enzymes from white -rot fungi are only secreted in small amounts, so their 
using in industrial applications has been limited due to low productivity and high economic cost (Rivera -
Hoyos 2013) .  
Enzyme production can be affected by many factors. One of the most critical factor s is type and 
concentration of the inducer agent ( Majeau 2010 ). The inducer is a specific molecule that induces 
synthesis of the relevant inducible enzyme and is usually a substrate for a given enzyme. Colli ns and 
Dobson (1997)  and Palmieri et al. (2000)  found that laccase expression of basidiomycetes is induced by 
copper at a transcriptional level. It is known that the most important metal for white -rot fungi is copper, 
which is a cofactor in the catalytic c enter of laccase; thus, a minimum concentration (millimolar range) 
of copper ions was necessary for production of the active enzyme.   
MENDEL NET 2016  
 
  764 | Page  The possible mechanism for this phenomenon is that copper ions enhance the laccase genetic 
transcription level during the l accase synthesis. A higher enzyme activity guarantees a higher and faster 
transformation of the target substrate and improves the applicability and effectiveness of the enzyme 
catalyzed processes (Rao et al. 2014) .  
In this paper, the most effective laccase produced by Trametes versicolor and Fomes fomentarius  
was chosen based on previous study and induced by 0.5 mM copper sulphate and further investigated 
with respect to the effects on synthetic dye decolorization.  
MATERIAL AND METHODS   
Fungal strains and culture conditions   
Locally isolated fungal strains Trametes versicolor and Fomes fomentarius  obtained from the 
Culture Collection of the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Technology of the Mendel University in Brno 
(Czech R epublic) were used in this study. Cultures were cultivated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)  for 
10 days at 22 °C.  
Dyes decolorization  
The dye decolorization experiment was performed using five  different synthetic dyes from 
different dye classes such as Malachite Green (MG), Crystal Violet (CV), Bromothymol Blue (BB), 
Methyl Red (MR) and Methylene Blue (MB). Table 1 shows the final concentration and the maximum 
wavelength  of the dyes. The light absorption for each dye was m onitored using a VISIONlite SCAN 
program on Helios Epsilon spectrophotometer.

Decolorization of dyes by Trametes versicolor and Fomes fomentarius  fungal culture   
For decolorization experiments, three agar plugs (5 mm2) of active mycelium from PDA plates 
were transferred aseptically into 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 ml of PDB  (Potato Dextrose 
Broth)  medium with different concentration of dyes (Table 1) and incubated at 28 °C in dark for 20 
days. Decolorization  experiment was prepared in different variants: sterilized medium with dyes ; 
sterilized medium with dyes and 0.5 mM copper inducer and sterilized medium containing the dyes but 
not inoculated with the fungus. Culture samples were collected every 4 days, centrifuged at 10 000 g for 
10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants obtained were used for decolorization assay by fungal culture.  
Decolorization assay by fungal culture   
Dye concentrations were selected in order to obtain approximately 1.5 absorbance units at the 
maximum wavelength in the visible spectrum. All the tested flasks were incubated at room temperature, 
without shaking and in dark. The residual dye concentration was measured spectrophotometrically  at 
their maximum wavelength , as shown in Table 1, and calculated from  measur ed absorbance according 
to the following expression:

absorbance . A control test containing the same amount of a heat -denatured laccase was also performed 
in parallel.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON  
The decolorization of model synthetic dyes is a simple method to assess the bioremediation 
potential of ligninolytic enzymes , especially laccase. In general, the efficiency of decolorization  depends 
on the structure of dye, fungi and enzymes used and experimental conditions as well as presence of 
inducer  (Zhang et al. 2006 ). The ability of fungal mycelium obtained from Trametes versicolor and 
Fomes fomentarius  to decolo rize 5 synthetic dyes w ith different structure was examined. Acquired 
results were compared with experiment when the fung al laccase was induced by 0.5 mM copper 
sulphate . 
Day decolorization by two different white -rot fungi   
Many studies with Trametes strains have been extensively conducted. In our study Trametes 
versicolor and Fomes fomentarius  were chosen as significant producers of laccase ( Rodrigues et al. 
2008) . Higher effect of dye decolorization was observed using Trametes , which agree with obse rvation 
of Selv am et al. (2002), who used Fomes  and Trametes strains to decolorization of industrial dyes and 
maximal effect was observed using Trametes on the fourth day  (Figure 1) . The slow increase of 
decolorization by Fomes  was observed during all the time of cultivation  (Figure 2) . Large variations 
exist among different white -rot species in the ability to produce the different isoenzymes, but also they 
can vary over time ( Hatakka  and Hammel  2010) . However, Neifar et al. ( 2011) studied Fomes 
fomentarius  and showed a promising future of applying laccase system of this fungus  for indu strial 
wastewater decolorization and bioremediation . 
Dye decolorization with and without copper inducer  
The positive effect of copper addition in the form of copper sulph ate on laccase activity has been 
reported by many authors  (Palmieri et al. 2000, Levin et al. 2002) . In our study the copper was used as 
inducer to increase dye decolorization effect .   
Addition of copper sulphate  stimulated decolorization , the presence of co pper increased around 
3-4-fold the degradation capability by both fungi throughout the experiment  in comparison with 
cultivation without laccase inducer.  
The highe r decolorization effect using  copper  suggested that induction of laccase significantly 
influenced decolorization process. It is known that the presence of laccase inducer (Cu2+) in the process 
increased the range and rate of decolorization  (Levin et al. 2002) . 
Our finding is in accordance with work of Zouari -Mechichi et al.  (2006) , who observed that the 
decolorization using Trametes trogii  is possible in the presence of Cu2+ and it was faster when Cu2+ was 
present in the medium. Lorenzo et al. (2006) observed that addition of copper increased laccase activity 
and this factor played an important role in the decolorization of the textile dye.  
Decolorization effect of five types of synthetic dyes  
The synthetic dye decolorization efficiency of the biomass from fungus Trametes versicolor was 
the highest for the triarylmethanic dyes Malachite Green  and Bromothymol Blue  with a maximu m of 
95% after 4  days of cultivation using 0.5 mM copper inducer . For Fomes fomentarius  the ability to 
decolorize  the triarylmethanic dyes around 70% during the period of cultivation  was observed . 
Bromothymol Blue and Malachite Green share very close structure with three benzene rings and these 
dyes might fit well with the enzyme activity cente rs and can be degraded  (Ling et al. 2015) . It is in 
contrary with work  of (Jayasinghe et al. 2008 ), who tested different fungal strains and Fomes  
fomentarius  showed better mycelial growth and decolorization of M alachi te Green than Trametes 
versicolor.  
The decolorization ability  for Methyl Red , which belongs to azo dyes, was around 80 % for both 
fungal strains , which agree  with work of Sharma et al.  (2015) , who tested ability of  white -rot fungi to 
decolorize azo dye s. Wong and Yu (1999)  reported that dye decolorization by fungi  was dependent on 
dye structure. Different dyes hav e different molecular structures. So a fungus capable of decolorizing  
MENDEL NET 2016  
 
  766 | Page  one dye may have different capacities for other dyes. One of the lowest decolorization was observed for  
Crystal Vi olet, which belongs to triphenylmethane dye  and for heterocyclic dye Methylene Blue . It can  
be due to the fact that the triphenylmethane dyes are known to be resistant to enzymatic decolorization 
in comparison with azo dyes and hence more time for decolorization is required  (Hughes and Poole 
1991) . It is in contrast with the study Yan et al.  (2009) , who suggested the efficient decolorization of 
Crystal Violet using fungus  Trametes trogii .

The mechanism for decolorization by white -rot fungi consist of a combination of biosorption by 
fungal mycelia and biodegradation by extracellular laccase. High decolorization effect by fungal 
mycelium is through adsorption of the dyes onto its cell surface. This type of decolorization has been 
reported to be the primary mechanism of decolorization and major to decolorization by enzymatic 
preparations (Selvam et al. 2002).

  767 | Page  CONCLUSION  
In this study white -rot fungi Trametes versicolor and Fomes fom entarius  have been investigated 
as potential producers of laccase enzyme and copper sulphate was successfully used as potential inducer 
of laccase. Fungi were used to decolorize five synthetic dyes in the form of fungal mycelium . This effect 
is more pronounced, when copper inducer was present in cultivation medium. Therefore, laccase inducer 
showed great potential to be used in process of color removing from textile wastewaters.  
Higher decoloriz ation effect was observed using Trametes strain than Fomes  and our study 
confirmed that each strain has different capability to decolorize synthetic dyes.
