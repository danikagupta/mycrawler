ABSTRACT
The kinetics of Basic Red 18 and Acid Blue 9 sorption onto acti-
vated clay have been investigated. A batch sorption model, basedon the assumption of a pseudo–second order mechanism, has beendeveloped to predict the rate constant of sorption, the equilibriumsorption capacity, and initial sorption rate with the effect of initialdye concentration, activated clay particle size, temperature, andpH value. In addition, an activation energy of sorption has alsobeen determined based on the pseudo–second order rate constants.

A major interest in the use of cheap sorbents for the removal of dyes from
aqueous effluents has been established during the past 20 years. Several sorbentshave been successfully and economically used for dye removal, such as waste sil-ica (1), hardwood sawdust (2), fly ash (3), chrome sludge (4), waste red mud (5),waste Fe(III)/Cr(III) hydroxide (6), waste banana pith (7), waste orange peel (8),biogas waste slurry (9), clay, bagasse pith, and maize cob, (10) and palm-fruitbunch (11). However, no kinetic model could be used for these sorption processes,probably because of the complicated sorption that is often categorized as two maintypes. The first type, physisorption, involves intermolecular forces, where thebonding between sorbent and sorbate is caused by Van der Waals forces and hy-drogen bonds. The second type, chemisorption, involves valence forces in whichelectrons are covalently shared or exchanged between sorbent and sorbate.
The study of sorption kinetics in wastewater treatment is significant as it
provides valuable insights into the reaction pathways and mechanisms of sorptionreactions. Kinetics describe the solute uptake rate that controls the residence timeof sorbate uptake at the solid-solution interface, and are important because to de-sign appropriate sorption treatment plants, the rate at which any pollutant is re-moved from aqueous solutions must be predicted.
The pseudo–first order rate equation of Lagergren (12) has been widely ap-
plied since 1898. The earlier application of the pseudo–first order rate equation ofLagergren to the sorption of cellulose triacetate from chloroform on calcium sili-cate was undertaken by Trivedi, Patel, and Patel (13). Numerous studies reportpseudo–first order Lagergren kinetics for the sorption of dyes, such as the sorp-tion of Omega Chrome Red ME (a popular chrome dye) through a 1:1 ratio of flyash to coal (14) and the sorption of methylene blue on water hyacinth roots (15).Table 1 shows a number of other pseudo–first order dye sorption systems.
In 1995, Ho (21) developed a pseudo–second order kinetic expression for
the sorption system of divalent metal ions with sphagnum moss peat. It has alsobeen applied to the sorption system of lead ions (22). The pseudo–second orderrate equation of Ho has also been successfully applied to sorption systems such asthose of basic and acid dyes with peat (23), wood (24), and pith (25).
The aim of this paper is to present an investigation of the kinetics of dye
sorption when activated clay is used as the sorbent. The objective is to test thepseudo–second order model for analyzing the sorption of a basic dye, Basic Red18 (BR18). and an acid dye, Acid Blue 9 (AB9), onto activated clay and to as-sess the usefulness and accuracy of the model. A study of the factors that affectthe sorption kinetics includes the influence of the particle size of the activatedclay, temperature, pH, and initial dye concentration. A rate parameter, k, 
has been defined and used to describe the sorption of acid dye onto activatedclay.2474 HO, CHIANG, AND HSUEXPERIMENTAL

Methods
Dye solutions (500 mL) were prepared in reverse-osmosis treated water at
pH 3.0 and maintained at a temperature of 30 °C prior to the experiment (Solution
A).
The activated clay particles were /H1102138 /H9262m in diameter and had been dried in
an oven (120 °C) for more than 24 h. For all tests, the required amount of clay (2
g/dm3for BR18 and 3 g/dm3 for AB9) was placed in a stirring chamber that con-
tained 400 mL of reverse-osmosis treated water at pH 3.0 and maintained at a con-stant temperature of 30 °C (Solution B).
Before mixing, 100 mL of Solution A was removed for the measurement of
the initial dye concentration, while the remaining 400 mL was immediately de-canted into Solution B for the adsorption experiment.
At intervals of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 30.0, 60.0, and 120.0 min, a 2 mL sam-
ple was withdrawn with a 20 mL syringe. It was then filtered through a membranefilter. The filtrate was diluted to a proper concentration for optical measurements.
The effect of experimental parameters, such as the initial dye concentration,
the particle size of activated clay, the temperature, and initial pH value, were alsostudied (Tables 3 –6). All experiments were carried out by changing one parame-
ter at a time while holding the others constant.Acid Blue 9 (C.I. Acid Blue 9, C.I. 42090)Basic Red 18 (C.I. Basic Red 18, C.I. 11085)DYE REMOVAL WITH CLAY 2477

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Several steps can be used to express the mechanism of solute sorption onto
a sorbent. To investigate the mechanism of sorption, the constants of sorptionwere determined by using a pseudo –second order mechanism.
The sorption kinetics may be described by the pseudo –second order model
(21) that is shown in Eq. (1).

Eq. (1) can be rearranged to a linear form:

and
h /H11005kqe2(3)
The data in straight-line plots of t/qtagainst thave also been tested to obtain
rate parameters. The pseudo –second order rate constant, k, initial sorption rate, h,
equilibrium sorption capacity, qe, and correlation coefficients, r2, for the dyes un-
der variable conditions were calculated from the data represented in these plots.
Effect of Particle Size
Two series of experiments were carried out to study the influence of acti-
vated clay particle size. Figures 1 and 2 show the experimental results for the sorp-tion of BR18 and AB9 onto activated clay. Table 3 shows that the sorption ca-pacity of BR18 decreased from 157 to 110 mg/g as the activated clay particle sizesincreased from 0 –38 to 75 –106 /H9262m, while, the sorption capacity of AB9 de-
creased from 57.8 to 21.1 mg/g. This indicates that the smaller the activated clayparticle size for a given mass of activated clay, the more surface area is availableand as a consequence the greater the number of binding sites available. The ki-netics of AB9 and BR18 sorption on activated clay follows the pseudo –second or-
der rate expression. Linear plots of the t/q
tagainst tin Figs. 3 and 4 show the ap-
plicability of the pseudo –second order equation for the systems of BR18 and AB9
with activated clay particles ranging from 0 –38 to 75 –106 /H9262m in diameter. The
correlation coefficients, r2, the pseudo –second order rate constants, k, the initial
sorption rates, h, and the equilibrium sorption capacities, qe, are presented in Table
3. The data show good compliance with the pseudo –second order equation be-
cause the regression coefficients are higher than 0.989 for all the systems in thisstudy. The sorption process may involve a chemical reaction process and demon-DYE REMOVAL WITH CLAY 2479

strate that kis a function of the available surface area of the activated clay. The
initial sorption rates also decreased with increased particle size. This would be ex-pected because the amount of external surface area available for rapid reaction de-creased with increased particle sizes for constant sorbent mass.
Effect of Initial Concentration
The influence of initial dye concentration was studied with BR18 and AB9.
The kinetic data obtained from batch studies have been analyzed by using thepseudo –second order model developed by Ho (21) for the sorption of BR18 and
AB9. The kinetics of BR18 and AB9 sorption on activated clay follows thepseudo –second order rate expression. Table 4 shows that the equilibrium sorption
capacity increased from 54.3 to 208 mg/g as the initial concentration varied from111 to 520 mg/dm
3for BR18, and it increased from 7.29 to 58.2 mg/g as the initial
concentration of AB9 increased from nearly 59.7 to 552 mg/dm3. It is clear that the
sorption capacity of basic dye is always much higher than acid dye in the activatedclay sorption system. Similar results were observed by Ho and McKay for the sorp-tion capacity of Basic Blue 69 and Acid Blue 25 onto peat (23) and onto wood (24);they found the same results for Basic Red 22 and Acid Red 114 onto pith (25). How-ever, the values of the rate constant were found to decrease from 1.74 /H1100310
/H110022to
1.69 /H1100310/H110022g/mg /H11080min as the initial concentration increased from 111 to 520
mg/dm3for BR18, and it decreased from 99.3 /H1100310/H110022to 1.49 /H1100310/H110022g/mg /H11080min as
the initial concentration increased from nearly 59.7 to 552 mg/dm3for AB9. Ho
and McKay presented similar results for the sorption systems of basic and acid dyesonto peat (23), wood (24), and pith (25). In addition, Table 4 shows good compli-ance with the pseudo –second order equation with the regression coefficients for the
linear plots being higher than 0.999 for all the systems in this study.
Effect of Temperature
The temperature dependence of the sorption rates also is reflected in ex-
tremely high correlation coefficients. Figure 5 shows how temperature influencesthe time to reach saturation, and an excellent agreement exists between the exper-imental data and the theoretical curves that are predicted through the use of Eq.(1). The results suggest that the chemisorption reaction or an activation processwas becoming more predominant in the rate-controlling step because Eq. (1) wasbased on the assumption of a chemical mechanism (21). Table 5 shows that thepseudo –second order rate constants for the AB9/activated clay system increased
steadily with higher temperatures. The sorption capacity decreased from 82.2 to56.4 mg/g and the initial sorption rate decreased from 80.3 to 46.1 mg/g /H11080min2482 HO, CHIANG, AND HSU
(Table 5), when the temperature increased from 283 to 313 K. The increase in the
equilibrium sorption of AB9 with temperature indicates that a low temperature fa-vors AB9 removal by sorption to activated clay because an elevation in tempera-ture increases the escaping tendency of AB9 from an interface. This effect sug-gests that an explanation of the sorption mechanism associated with the removalof AB9 onto activated clay involves a physical process. A similar decrease in ca-pacity was observed by Ho and McKay (23) with increasing temperature from 18to 80 °C in the case of the sorption of AB25 onto peat.

g/mg /H11080min, as the solution temperatures increased from 283 to 313K (Table 5).
There is a linear relationship (Fig. 6) between the pseudo rate-constant and the re-ciprocal of the temperature: r
2/H110050.983. Therefore, the sorption rate constant may
be expressed as a function of temperature by the following relationship:

In the equation, the temperature independent factor, k0, is 8.68 /H1100310/H110022g/mg /H11080min.
Furthermore, the activation energy of sorption, E, is 4.67 kJ/mole for the sorption
system AB9 on activated clay. Because the sorption of AB9 onto activated clay isan exothermic process, an increasing solution temperature would be expected toresult in a decreased sorption capacity.
Effect of Initial pH
Because ion exchange is one of the sorption processes, the rate of AB9 sorp-
tion onto activated clay was expected to vary by pH values of solution in the ex-periments. The pH values used in these studies were 3.00, 5.00, 6.00, 7.00, 9.00,and 10.00. Figure 7 shows that the sorption of AB9 was affected by the pH valueand was represented linearly when AB9 uptake was plotted via the pseudo –sec-
ond order equation (2). The values of k, q
e, and hof sorption at various pH values
of BR18 are listed in Table 6.
The effect of pH on the sorption capacity of BH18 is shown in Fig. 8. The
extent of sorption decreased from 124 to 23.1 mg/g when the pH of the system var-

ied from 3.00 to 10.00. The extent of dye removal decreased rapidly as pH in-
creased from pH 3.00 to 5.00 and from 8.00 to 10.0. However, within the range of5.00 to 8.00 it almost remained constant. The increase in sorption depends on thesurface properties and dye structure. At a lower pH, the surface of the activatedclay becomes negatively charged. At higher pH, it becomes positively charged. Ata higher pH, the sorption of cationic dye should be less because of the higher dis-sociation of the dye molecules as well as the negatively charged surface. At alower pH, both the dye and surface will be dissociated. This results in a lowersorption through decreased cation exchange capabilities. In addition, this effectmay be explained on the basis of surface hydroxylation and acid-base dissociationand surface complexation (26). Similar descriptions have been reported for thesorption of acidic and basic dyes on kaolinite and montmorillonite (27), the sorp-tion of dye on fly ash (28), the sorption of fluoride on fly ash (29), the sorption ofbasic dye on silica (30), the sorption of dye on china clay (31), and the sorption ofcolor on chrome sludge (4).
CONCLUSIONS
The kinetics of sorption of BR18 and AB9 on activated clay have been stud-
ied on the basis of the pseudo –second order rate mechanism. The sorption capac-
ity of basic dye (BR18) is much higher than acid dye (AB9) because of the ioniccharges on the dyes and the character of the activated clay. The sorption capacityof dyes decreased as the activated clay particle sizes increased. A pseudo –second
order model has been developed to predict the rate constant of sorption, the equi-librium sorption capacity, and the initial sorption rate. The use of these constantsto generate the theoretically predicted curves shows that the kinetic model equa-tion has an extremely high degree of correlation with the experimental data. Theactivation energy of sorption can be evaluated with pseudo –second order rate con-
stants. The sorption of AB9 by activated clay is an exothermically activated pro-cess. The results show a good compliance with the pseudo –second order equation
because the regression coefficients are high. The results suggest that thechemisorption reaction or an activation process were becoming more predominantin the rate-controlling step for both dye/activated clay systems.
