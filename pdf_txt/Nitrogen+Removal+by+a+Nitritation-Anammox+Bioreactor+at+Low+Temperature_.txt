Engineering applications ABSTRACT  
The anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process has the advantages of high efficiency and low energy 
consumption, so it has broad application prospects in biological denitrification of wastewater. However, the 
application of anammox technology to existing wastewater treatment is still challenging. The main problems are 
the insufficient supply of nitrite and the susceptibility of anammox bacteria to environmental factors. In this 
paper, from the perspective of the diversity of anammox bacteria, the habitats and characteristics of anammox 
bacteria of different genera were compared. At the same time, laboratory research and engineering applications 
of anammox technology in treating wastewater from different sources were reviewed, and the progress of and 
obstacles to the practical application of anammox technology were clarified. Finally, a focus for future research 
was proposed to intensively study the water quality barrier factors of anammox and its regulation strategies. 
Meanwhile, a combined process was developed and optimized on this basis.   
1.Introduction 
In recent years, increasingly strict nitrogen discharge standards have 
promoted the development of nitrogen pollutant removal technology. Traditional nitrification and denitrification biological nitrogen removal 
techniques have been widely used as effective methods for treating ni-
trogen pollutants in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. A large 
amount of energy consumption promotes the continuous development

2of traditional nitrogen removal technology. Anaerobic ammonium 
oxidation (anammox) has been considered one of the most effective 
nitrogen removal processes since it was proposed in the Netherlands in 
1990 (Lackner et al., 2014 ). Compared with traditional nitrification and 
denitrification processes, this process can directly produce nitrogen 
under anoxic conditions using ammonium as an electron donor and ni-
trite as an electron acceptor (Strous et al., 1998 ). Therefore, anammox 
has the advantages of having no additional organic carbon source, a high 
nitrogen removal load, a low operating cost and a small footprint 
(Lawson et al., 2017 ). 
In recent years, substantial laboratory results have been obtained in 
research on anammox processes. However, the application of the 
anammox process to actual wastewater treatment remains a large 
challenge. On the one hand, anammox bacteria grow slowly (doubling 
time 10–12 days) and have a long start-up cycle and low cell yield (Wu 
et al., 2022 ). On the other hand, due to the complex composition of 
actual wastewater, there are often insufficient electron acceptors. At the 
same time, anammox bacteria are sensitive to environmental conditions, 
and actual wastewater often contains anammox inhibiting substances, 
such as antibiotics (Zhang et al., 2021c ), heavy metals (Ma et al., 2021 ), 
and salinity (Zhang et al., 2021b ). These problems limit the large-scale 
application of anammox processes in practical engineering. 
Due to the complex composition of actual wastewater, different types 
of wastewater present specific challenges for sensitive anammox bac-
teria. This limitation emerges as a big challenge for application of 
anammox technology in the field of wastewater treatment. Currently, 
most anammox processes need to be combined with other processes to 
provide substrates for anammox bacteria while simultaneously 
addressing more complex wastewater. Partial nitrification (PN) can 
utilize ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) to provide nitrite as a key 
substrate for anammox bacteria. Since both AOB and anammox bacteria 
are autotrophic, partial nitrification/anammox (PN/A) does not require 
the addition of additional organic carbon, it can save approximately 60 
% of the aeration cost (Wang et al., 2022 ). However, low influent 
ammonia concentrations and temperature conditions are a challenge to 
maintaining the activity and growth rate of AOB and anammox (Wang 
et al., 2022 ). At the same time, if the C/N ratio in urban sewage is too 
high, then anammox bacteria are susceptible to the adverse effects of 
organic carbon. In recent years, researchers have found that partial 
denitrification (PD) can provide a more stable nitrite for the anammox 
process (Du et al., 2016 ). In conclusion, there are many problems to be 
clarified about the applicability of anammox coupling process to various 
types of wastewater. 
At present, the actual field application of the anammox process is still 
limited by the actual sewage temperature, ammonia nitrogen concen -
tration, organic concentration and other factors. Its coupling with PN, 
PD and other processes is also in the experimental stage. Based on the 
above problems, it is necessary to systematically summarize the appli -
cation examples and experiences implementing anammox processes in 
recent years to promote the further industrial application of anammox 
processes to ensure this process plays a more active role in the field of 
wastewater denitrification treatment. This review introduces the di-
versity of anammox bacteria and anammox processes. According to 
different types of sewage water quality conditions, the selection of in-
tegrated or split process types and the theoretical key factors for the 
stable operation of the process are discussed. The application of anam -
mox technology in the treatment of various kinds of wastewater are 
reviewed. Also, the advantages and limitations of anammox denitrifi -
cation technology were fully evaluated based on the laboratory and 
engineering application. 
2.Biodiversity of anammox bacteria 
Anammox bacteria that mediate the anammox process were first 
found in wastewater, and since then, anammox bacteria have been 
found to be widely distributed in anoxic areas in natural ecosystems. These areas include marine sediments (Rios-Del Toro et al., 2017 ), 
mangrove areas (Dai et al., 2021 ), oxygen minimum zones (Karth auser 
et al., 2021 ), etc. 
As major players in the global nitrogen cycle, anammox bacteria 
belong to the phylum Planctomycetes (Ahmad et al., 2020 ). Up to now, 
six genera of anammox bacteria have been discovered, currently 
including Candidatus Jettenia, Candidatus Anammoximicrobium, Can-
didatus Anammoxoglobus, Candidatus Scalindua, Candidatus Kuenenia 
and Candidatus Brocadia (Lodha et al., 2021 ). Anammox bacteria are a 
special group of bacteria with the characteristic anammoxosome struc-
ture (Moss Frank et al., 2018 ). Sinninghe Damst ˘e et al. (2002) analyzed 
the membrane structure of anammoxosomes and found that there was a 
special component, ladderane lipids, on the membrane. Ladderane lipids 
have a dense structure and poor permeability, which can prevent the 
leakage of toxic substances produced in the process of anammox and 
prevent toxic effects from occurring on the anammox bacteria them -
selves (Moss Frank et al., 2018 ). 
Anammox bacteria of different genera have different physiological 
and ecological characteristics. It was found that Candidatus Brocadia is 
more suitable for living environments with high NH4-N and NO2–-N 
concentrations due to its low affinity for substrates. Candidatus Kuenenia 
is on the opposite situation. Candidatus Jettenia shows high nitrite 
tolerance compared with that of others (Oshiki et al., 2016 ). Candidatus 
Anammoxoglobus can oxidize formic acid and propionic acid and is 
suitable for survival in living environments containing organic matter 
such as sludge digests, landfill leachates and livestock and poultry 
breeding effluents. The niche of Candidatus Scalindua is characterized by 
a high salinity level and low temperature (Dale et al., 2009 ). The suit-
able temperature range of Candidatus Scalindua is also lower than that of 
the other genera (Kouba et al., 2022 ). Therefore, the application of ni-
trogen removal in industrial wastewater with high salinity has certain 
advantages. Table 1 lists the habitat conditions of anammox bacteria. 
The ecological diversity of anammox bacteria is determined by their 
metabolic diversity. Because of this, anammox is very important in the 
global nitrogen cycle. It also has inherent advantages and inestimable 
potential to be applied to the treatment of nitrogen-containing waste -
water of different water qualities. 
3.Diversity of anammox process forms 
There are a variety of processes based on the principle of anammox, 
including two-stage systems and one-stage systems. The two-stage sys-
tem mainly includes the single reactor for high-activity ammonia 
removal over nitrite (SHARON)-anammox process. The one-stage sys-
tem includes completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite 
(CANON), oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification and denitrification 
(OLAND), denitrifying ammonium oxidation (DEAMOX), aerobic 
deammonification (DEMON), single-stage nitrogen removal using 
anammox and partial nitritation (SNAD) and other processes. 
Fig. 1 shows the microbial principle diagram of the new biological 
nitrogen removal process. The SHARON process can provide NH4-N/ 
NO2–-N with a ratio close to 1 for the anammox process through PN. 
Compared to those of traditional processes, the advantages of the 
SHARON-anammox combined process are a 60 % reduction in aeration, 
no additional requirement of organic carbon and low residual biomass 
yield. This process has a better treatment performance on high ammonia 
nitrogen and low nitrite wastewater (van Dongen et al., 2001a ). The 
CANON process refers to the process that combines PN and anammox 
processes in a single aeration reactor and is the anammox process with 
the most research and application in the world (Wang et al., 2019 ). 
Compared to SHARON-anammox, the CANON process with a single 
reactor allows a savings of 63 % oxygen and 100 % organic carbon 
consumption, with a lower footprint and investment costs (P˘erez et al., 
2014 ). Compared with traditional nitrification and denitrification pro-
cesses, SHARON-anammox and CANON have the characteristics of low 
sludge yield and no need to control pH and chemical oxygen demand Z.-Q. Ren et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioresource Technology 363 (2022) 127896
3(COD) (Manipura et al., 2005 ). Different from CANON, OLAND realizes 
NH4-N removal by AOB, through the combination of PN and anammox 
at low C/N ratio wastewater. The process is carried out in a rotating 
biological disk system under the condition of strict oxygen restriction 
(Courtens et al., 2014 ). The DEAMOX process was proposed in 2004 and 
uses sulfide as an electron donor to reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas 
(Kalyuzhnyi & Gladchenko, 2009 ). The process is suitable for sulfuri -
zation of wastewater containing nitrogen pollutants. At the same time, 
SNAD processes rely on the synergistic effect of three functional bacte -
ria, AOB, anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrification bacteria, 
to achieve effective removal of nitrogen and COD (Liu et al., 2022 ). 
Fig. 2 shows the competition and cooperation of anammox bacteria, 
nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria. In the PN stage, AOB 
partially oxidizes ammonia nitrogen to nitrite, which provides the 
necessary growth substrate for anammox bacteria. At the same time, 
nitrate denitrification can also provide another way for anammox bac-
teria to obtain nitrite. Therefore, when the wastewater contains both 
ammonia and nitrate, the combined process of PD/A has certain appli -
cation prospects (Guo et al., 2021 ). PD is achieved by denitrifying 
bacteria, and from the perspective of gene expression, it is due to the 
transcription of Nir genes caused by denitrifying bacteria without the 
regulation of C/N ratio (Zhang et al., 2020 ). Low concentration of COD 
can stimulate the growth of heterotrophic microorganisms and improve 
the nitrogen removal rate through denitrification. But at the same time, high COD will inhibit the activity of anammox bacteria and increase the 
competition of nitrite between anammox bacteria and denitrifying 
bacteria. Therefore, it is very important to control the concentration of 
organic matter and dissolved oxygen in the influent to exert the 
competition and cooperation between AOB, anammox bacteria and 
denitrifying bacteria. According to the characteristics of each functional 
microorganism, the corresponding regulatory strategies were selected to 
achieve stable and efficient nitrogen removal. 
The one-stage systems are gaining popularity as engineering expe-
rience increases. In addition, a one-stage system has lower infrastructure 
costs and a smaller footprint and is easier to operate, and it can avoid 
nitrite inhibition (Vlaeminck et al., 2012 ). Whereas, the start-up time of 
the one-stage process is long. The ecological relationship between the 
microorganisms in the reactor is complex, and it easily becomes unstable 
when subjected to load shocks. One-stage systems tend to have higher 
environmental sensitivity, such as pH and temperature, making NOB 
control more difficult (Li et al., 2018 ). The advantages of two-stage 
processes mainly lie in low environmental sensitivity and stronger 
thallus amplification ability. However, the operation condition setting 
and operation of the process are often more complicated. In other words, 
these two types of processes have their own characteristics and appli -
cability. The application should be based on specific conditions, such as 
water quality, site, and management level. Table 1

44.Diversity of applications 
Table 2 lists some representative engineering examples. With the 
popularity of anammox process, this novel nitrogen removal technology 
has been successfully applied to treat a variety of wastewaters, including 
sludge liquid with a high NH4-N concentration and low C/N ratio, black 
water, landfill leachate, etc. Among the technologies, the most widely used are sludge digesters and sludge pressure filtration liquid. The 
promotion of this technology in the treatment of industrial wastewater 
and landfill leachate, such as those from tanning, semiconductors, and 
food processing, has also been gradually carried out. However, there are 
still relatively few applications in treating high NH4-N concentration 
industrial wastewater.

64.1. Treatment of sludge liquid 
Sludge digestion liquid and sludge pressure filtration liquid are 
typical wastewater types with low C/N ratios. Among them, sludge 
digestion liquid contains 500–2000 mg⋅L-1 NH4-N and approximately 
2000 –3000 mg⋅L-1 organic matter with poor biodegradability (Wang 
et al., 2017 ). Because the pH value of sludge liquid is generally 7.0–8.5, 
the temperature is generally 30–37 •C. Therefore, the high basicity and 
temperature of sludge digestion liquid are generally the optimal growth 
conditions for the growth of anammox bacteria and AOB (Wang et al., 
2017 ). 
van Dongen et al. (2001b) first explored the feasibility of PN and 
anammox processes for the treatment of digested sludge supernatant 
from the Dokhaven sewage treatment plant in the Netherlands. They 
achieved a remarkable denitrification effect, with more than 80 % of the 
NH4-N converted to N2. Given this information, in 2002, researchers 
directly scaled up the reactor to build the world ’s first productive PN/A 
combined reactor. The process was already in operation at the Dokhaven 
sewage treatment plant. The anammox reactor had a volume of 70 m3 
and a processing capacity of 750 kg N⋅d-1 (van der Star et al., 2007 ). 
Since that time, the use of the anammox process for sludge treatment has 
become popular in Europe. Wang et al. (2017) achieved a stable PN 
process by controlling the concentrations of free ammonia and free 
nitrous acid. An NRR of 1.23 kg N⋅m 3⋅d-1 was achieved in the pilot- 
scale PN/A reactor. For wastewater with NH4-N concentrations of 
2100 –2200 mg⋅L-1, the treatment efficiency reached 98.82 %. 
Sludge liquid has become the initial treatment object of anammox 
because of its high water temperature, low water volume, high NH4-N 
concentration and low C/N ratio. Approximately 75 % of the world ’s 
anammox engineering units are used to treat sludge liquid, and the 
anammox process has matured and been used in this field. However, 
there are still some urgent technical problems that need to be addressed, 
such as the effect of anaerobic digestion of sulfide in water on anammox 
reaction systems, nitrogen oxide generation links and emission reduc -
tion measures. 
4.2. Treatment of landfill leachate 
Landfill leachate is a kind of wastewater with complex components 
that is characterized by a high concentration of organic matter, a high 
content of toxic substances such as heavy metals, great variation in 
water quality, a high content of NH4-N, a high salt content and poor 
biodegradability (Iskander et al., 2018 ). Compared with traditional 
physical and chemical methods, biological treatment technology can 
achieve nitrogen and organic matter removal in sewage more effectively 
and is often more economical and environmentally friendly (Ren et al., 
2022 ). 
For a one-stage treatment process, Jiang et al. (2021) established a 
PN/A and PD/A combined process by using a sequencing batch biofilm 
reactor (SBBR). The main contribution of PN/A to nitrogen removal was 
76.04 %, and the NRR and NRE were 2.83 ±0.06 kg N⋅m 3⋅d-1 and 98.6 
±0.2 %, respectively. Ren et al. (2022) , based on the integrated fixed- 
film activated sludge (IFAS) PN/A process, established a step feed 
continuous plug-in flow system to treat mature landfill leachate. At 
301–405 days of operation, 98.1 % of the total inorganic NRE and 52.9 
% of the COD removal rate were achieved. For mature landfill leachate 
and waste activated sludge, Zhang et al. (2022a) used three independent 
SBR reactors were used to combine PN and integrate fermenta -
tion–denitrification and PN/A. They developed a new PN, in situ 
fermentation, and anammox (PNFA) system. Finally, an NRE of 99.2 ±
0.1 % was achieved. 
At present, there are generally many studies on the anammox process 
to treat landfill leachate, and the PN/A process is commonly used. At the 
same time, researchers continue to try various combination technolo -
gies. This is mainly because this leachate contains more toxic substances, 
such as heavy metals, which inhibit anammox activity to a certain extent. Therefore, the inhibition of these inhibitory substances in landfill 
leachates of different ages on microorganisms, the effect of the bacterial 
community and the regulatory countermeasures need to be further 
studied. 
4.3. Treatment of livestock and poultry breeding wastewater 
Livestock and poultry breeding wastewater has a complex compo -
sition, large fluctuations in water quality and quantity, high COD con-
centrations and partial organic nitrogen (Xian et al., 2010 ). At the same 
time, antibiotic pollution in livestock and poultry wastewater has been 
widely studied. Due to the simultaneous threat of antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes, the operation and perfor -
mance of wastewater treatment processes can be affected (Ma et al., 
2022 ). The traditional nitrification and denitrification treatment of this 
kind of high NH4-N aquaculture wastewater has many disadvantages, 
such as high energy consumption, poor nitrogen removal effect, and the 
need to supplement carbon source or add an alkali. Therefore, anammox 
is expected to be an alternative process for denitrification of aquaculture 
wastewater. 
Recently, researchers have developed different PN/A processes to 
treat livestock and poultry wastewater. For swine wastewater, a nitro-
gen loading rate of 3.27 ±0.13 g N⋅L-1⋅d-1 was achieved, but the deni-
trification efficiency was not stable (Chini et al., 2020 ). Yamamoto et al. 
(2008) found that an NRR of 0.22 kg N⋅m 3⋅d-1 was reached after 70 
days of operation of the reactor, and the color of anammox sludge 
changed to grayish black. Chen et al. (2021) successfully applied an 
anammox-based combined biological nitrogen removal process (CBNR) 
to a full-scale anaerobic-anoxic –oxic (A2/O) system. A running strategy 
of intermittent aeration and nitrate-based carbon dosage was employed. 
The removal efficiency of total nitrogen in the first and second stages 
was 65.5 ±6.0 % and 83.5 ±6.7 %, respectively. 
At present, there are many problems, such as low NRR and unstable 
operation, in the treatment of anaerobic digestion liquid from pig farm 
wastewater by anammox. In addition, organic compounds, heavy 
metals, antibiotics and other components in wastewater may inhibit 
anammox bacteria. Therefore, we should focus on researching process 
optimization and seek countermeasures to eliminate the inhibition 
obstacles. 
4.4. Treatment of monosodium glutamate wastewater 
Monosodium glutamate wastewater is characterized by a high con-
centration of suspended solids, high COD, high biochemical oxygen 
demand (BOD), high NH4-N concentration, high SO42 concentration 
and low pH value (approximately 2). Treating this type of wastewater is 
expensive, and it is a difficult industrial wastewater to treat (Shen et al., 
2012 ). Physical and chemical methods and traditional biological treat-
ment measures were used for this kind of wastewater treatment. Because 
monosodium glutamate wastewater has complex components and 
certain biological toxicity, the removal effect of nitrogen pollutants by 
biological denitrification systems is poor. 
Shen et al. (2012) studied the impact of anammox bacterial enrich -
ment in landfill leachate treatment plants, municipal sewage treatment 
plants and monosodium glutamate wastewater treatment plants on start- 
up of a monosodium glutamate wastewater treatment. After 360 days of 
operation, the maximum specific anammox activities were 0.11 kg⋅kg 
VSS⋅d-1, 0.09 kg⋅kg VSS⋅d-1 and 0.16 kg⋅kg VSS⋅d-1, respectively. At 
present, the volume of the anammox reactor of the TongLiao Meihua 
monosodium glutamate wastewater Phase I project is up to 6600 m3, 
and it is the largest anammox project in the world (Driessen & Reitsma, 
2011 ). However, the high concentration of sulfate in monosodium 
glutamate wastewater (5000 –5500 mg⋅L-1) produces strong osmotic 
pressure, which greatly reduces the activity of microorganisms. At the 
same time, sulfate can also be converted to hydrogen sulfide by sulfate- 
reducing bacteria, significantly inhibiting anammox bacteria. Therefore, Z.-Q. Ren et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioresource Technology 363 (2022) 127896
7anammox is generally not used for direct treatment but only for subse -
quent treatment. Thus, the changes in these pollutants in the combined 
process and their influence on the anammox process remain to be 
studied. 
4.5. Treatment of urban domestic sewage 
With the development of urbanization, the regeneration of urban 
sewage and energy recovery have increasingly become the focus of 
research. The application of the autotrophic anammox process is ex-
pected to enable municipal wastewater plants to achieve energy self- 
sufficiency (van Loosdrecht & Brdjanovic, 2014 ). Mainstream urban 
sewage has the problems of low NH4-N concentrations, unstable nitro-
gen loads, and temperature changes with the season. 
Hu et al. (2013) adopted the process of integrated PN/A. The SBR (5 
L) originally operated at 25 •C adapted to the low-temperature envi-
ronment of 12 •C in only 10 days and ran stably under this temperature 
condition. For more than 300 days, there was no accumulation of nitrite, 
and the NRE exceeded 90 %. The study of Jin et al. (2013) showed that 
the NRR of a laboratory-scale anammox reactor operating at 35 •C could 
be as high as 6.61 kg N⋅m 3⋅d-1 at 9.1 •C by means of gradual cooling 
and acclimation or adding a low-temperature protective agent (glycine 
betaine). In Gao et al. (2022) , a step-feed anoxic –oxic process combined 
with a PD/A process was adopted to maintain stable treatment efficiency 
in municipal wastewater treatment at a medium temperature (26.8 •C to 
13.1 •C). 
At present, the anammox process at room temperature and a low 
temperature has a certain research basis, and the pilot study has ach-
ieved phased success, which is expected to make the wastewater treat-
ment plant realize energy self-support. However, to maintain the 
competitive advantage of AOB and NOB at a low temperature and low 
substrate concentration through actual engineering, the researchers still 
need to do further research. For example, thallus activity improved at a 
low temperature, thallus amplification was achieved at low substance 
concentrations, and thallus retention was achieved at high flow rates. 
4.6. Treatment of saline wastewater 
Some industrial effluents, such as those from seafood processing, 
textile printing and dyeing, pharmaceutical and petrochemical in-
dustries, tanning, farming and landfill leachate, contain large amounts 
of NH4-N and salts (Lin et al., 2021 ). Studies have shown that increasing 
the Kconcentration in saline wastewater can improve the treatment 
performance of the reactor (Jin et al., 2007 ). 
In terms of practical applications, a combined process coupling 
nitritation with an anammox system was used to evaluate the nitrogen 
removal performance of freshwater nitrifying anammox sludge under 
high salinity conditions, and a nitritation-anammox process gradually 
adapted to 3 % saline wastewater by enhancing aeration (Ge et al., 
2019 ). At a salinity of 5 %, anammox bacteria are inhibited, causing the 
system to collapse. Xu et al. (2022) developed a salt-tolerant PD/A 
process. It was found that both partial denitrification sludge and 
anammox sludge maintained high activity at a salinity of 10 g⋅L-1. A 
denitrification efficiency of 90 % was achieved by this process, which 
provided a new research scheme for the treatment of industrial waste -
water containing salt. However, the study of Ma et al. (2012) showed 
that an impact load of 30 NaCl ⋅L-1 was the threshold that the anammox 
reactor could tolerate while stably operating. Although the salinity load 
threshold that the anammox system can tolerate varies at present (30–75 
NaCl ⋅L-1), it has great potential to utilize the anammox process to treat 
industrial wastewater with high NH4-N concentration and salinity 
through long-term acclimation and the addition of compatible solutes 
(Liu et al., 2014 ). 4.7. Treatment of other types of wastewater 
Zhang et al. (2022b) indicated for the first time that a PD/A SBBR 
reactor can effectively treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing 
bismuth glutamate and bismuth potassium citrate. The results showed 
that the total NRR could reach 80.8 %, and the contribution rate of 
anammox accounted for 83.6 %. Li et al. (2019) coupled anammox and 
sulfur autotrophic reactors to process semiconductor wastewater, and 
the NRR of the anammox process reached 3.1 kg N⋅m 3⋅d-1. Tokutomi 
et al. (2011) transformed the original nitrification –denitrification pro-
cess into a PN/A-denitrification process. PN was achieved by selective 
inhibition of nitrite oxidation with a high concentration of bicarbonate. 
The NRR of the anammox reactor was 1.04 –3.29 kg N⋅m 3⋅d-1, and the 
effluent was treated by denitrification. Daverey et al. (2013) used the 
CANON process to treat photoelectric industrial wastewater with a high 
NH4-N concentration. An 18 L SBR was used to control the basicity of 
850 mg CaCO 3⋅L-1 by adding NaHCO 3. When the influent NH4-N con-
centration reached 3636 mg⋅L-1, the nitrogen loading rate was 0.909 kg 
N⋅m 3⋅d-1, and the NH4-N removal rate reached 98 %. Anammox pro-
cesses have been applied to various wastewaters at the laboratory and 
pilot scales, and they have also shown wide applicability for use in other 
wastewater treatments (Table 3). 
5.Future perspectives 
Wastewater composition is complex. Livestock breeding wastewater 
contains heavy metal ions and antibiotics. Landfill leachate contains 
relatively high content of heavy metals. Coking and petrochemical 
wastewater contains cyanide, tar, phenols, etc. Tannery wastewater 
contains many organic nitrogen and heavy metal ions. Pharmaceutical 
wastewater contains biological inhibitors. Sulfide is also contained in 
wastewater from seafood processing, tanning, papermaking, and fer-
menting alcohol. Aquaculture wastewater, fecal sewage, municipal 
wastewater, chemical fertilizer, and pharmaceutical wastewater contain 
phosphates at varying concentrations. The abovementioned obstacles 
are the key factors restricting the application of anammox technology in 
the field of high-concentration ammonia nitrogen industrial wastewater 
treatment. Although the current study involved multiple factors inhib -
iting anammox bacteria. However, due to different strains or experi -
mental conditions, the inhibitory thresholds of inhibitors differ, and 
whether they are reversible is also controversial. The combined effect 
has not yet been proven, and research on related regulatory strategies is 
very minimal. Moreover, for wastewater of different water qualities, the 
theoretical discussion on the choice of integrated and split process types 
has not been finalized, and practical proof still lacks operational data 
support. 
Nowadays, the sidestream anammox process has been widely 
established at full-scale. However, the problems of long start-up period 
and low nitrogen removal efficiency in sidestream wastewater treatment 
have not been solved well. The mainstream process is faced with the 
problems of low stability, high C/N ratio, poor retention of anammox 
bacteria and difficulty in inhibiting NOB activity, etc. At present, the 
mainstream applications of this technology were mainly at laboratory 
scale (Trinh et al., 2021 ). In addition, low influent ammonia concen -
tration and low temperature were unfavorable to the retention of bac-
terial biomass in anammox. Therefore, the problems of low nitrogen 
removal efficiency and low effluent quality still need to be improved 
(Poot et al., 2016 ). Researchers need to adopt effective strategies to 
remove high organic matter concentrations, maintain AOB growth ac-
tivity and control nitrite and free ammonium concentrations to promote 
the development of mainstream anammox technology (Miao et al., 
2020 ). 
In addition, anammox as a new biological denitrification process 
does not indicate the end of the traditional process, but it should be used 
as a supplement to the existing process and a bridge to the development 
of new processes. Due to the strict reaction conditions of anammox, the Z.-Q. Ren et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioresource Technology 363 (2022) 127896
8influence of and regulation strategies for different water quality obsta -
cles should be deeply studied to improve the engineering value of 
anammox. It is recommended that in-depth research on the following 
aspects be carried out in the future:  
(1) Development of a multiflora coupling process based on the 
anammox process. 
(2)Development of a combined process with anammox as an inter-
mediate biological unit.  
(3) Long-term, short-term and compound effects of wastewater 
quality barrier factors from different sources on each part of the 
combined anammox processes. 
6.Conclusion 
In this paper, according to the habitat characteristics of anammox 
bacteria, the quality characteristics of wastewater from different sources 
and the main inhibitory factors, one-stage and two-stage processes were 
compared to illustrate the applicability of different processes. At the 
same time, combined with laboratory research and engineering appli -
cation of anammox technology in the treatment of wastewater from 
different sources, the progress and obstacles of anammox technology in 
practical application were clarified. Finally, some suggestions were given for the application of anammox technology in actual wastewater 
treatment.
