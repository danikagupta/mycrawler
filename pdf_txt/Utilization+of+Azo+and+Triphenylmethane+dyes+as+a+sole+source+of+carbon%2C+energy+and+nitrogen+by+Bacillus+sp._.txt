          ABSTRACT                      
Introduction  
Textile industries have been using 
synthetic dyes intensively because of their 
ease and cost effectiveness in synthesis 
(Raju et al., 2008). Synthetic dyes are 
extensively used in the textile, food, 
cosmetics, Pharmaceutical, Paper, leather, 
Photographic and aquaculture industries 
(Chen et al., 1999). The main classes of 
dyes are azo, anthraquinone and 
triarymethane dyes based on their 
chromophoric groups and application 
technologies (Oranusi and Mbah 2005). 
Over 7x105 tons of these dyes are 
produced annually world wide (Zollinger,  
1987). It is estimated that about 10,000 
different types of dyes are used  
industrially    worldwide   (Carliell    et al., 
1995) and about 10 -15% of the dyes are    lost in the effluent during such dyeing 
processes (Vaidya and Datye, 1982). 
Commercially useful dyes must possess a 
high degree of Chemical and photolytic 
stability which implies that removal from 
effluent is difficult. Stability to microbial 
attack is also a required characteristics of 
dyes (Pagga and Brown, 1996). Thus they 
are less amenable to biodegradation and 
contribute to contamination of the 
environment (Riu  et al., 1998). Although 
the dyes impart only a minor fraction of 
organic load,colour removal is required 
not only for aesthetic reasons but also due 
to the toxicity to aquatic life and 
mutagenicity of few dyes and 
carcinogenicity of their degradation 
products (Coughlin  et al., 1997). ISSN: 2319 -7706 Volume 2 Number 11 (2013) pp. 218-226

& CR3) were compared with that of individual isolates in decolourizing, 2 azo dyes 
(Direct Red-28,Direct Blue-8) & a triphenylmethane dye (Basic Green-4) which 
were used in this study.The individual bacterial isolates were not able to  
completely decolourize these dyes. The consortium PVN-5 was able to decolourize 
all the 3 dyes used at an initial concentration of 100 mgl-1 at a significantly higher 
rate as compared to that achieved by individual isolates .

Most Physio-Chemical dye removal 
methods, which are generally used for the 
effluent treatment, have many limitations 
(Balcioglu and Arslan, 2001;Ghoreishi 
Haghighi, 2003). These methods are not 
only economically unattractive because of 
high cost and high energy input but are 
environmentally unfriendly because they 
merely transfer the pollutant from one 
phase to another. For example, 
chlorination generates toxic 
organochlorides (Saras et al., 1998). 
Biological treatments of dye waste waster 
under aerobic and/or anaerobic conditions 
have been reported (Cripps et al., 1990; 
Banat et al., 1996; Chen et al., 1999). 
Some dyes and/or their degradative by 
products (aromatic amines from azodyes 
and lecuco triphenylmethane from 
triphenylmethane dyes) are potentially 
toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic (Houk et 
al., 1991; Burchmore and Wilkinson,1993; 
Ganesh et al., 1994; Henderson et al., 
1997).  
Mixed culture studies may be more 
appropriate for decolourization of 
dyes.About 80% of colour removal in an 
effluent sample containing mixture of azo 
and diazo  
reactive dyes was observed by 
using mixed bacterial culture (Nigam et 
al., 1996). Higher degree of 
biodegradation and mineralization can be 
expected when co-metabolic activities of 
mixed cultures within a microbial 
community complement each other. The 
advantages of mixed cultures are apparent 
as some microbial consortia can 
collectively carry out biodegradation that 
cannot be achieved by pure culture culture 
(Nigam et al., 1996; Sharma et al., 2004).  
In the present study, we report a novel 
bacterial consortium named PVN-5 
compared with 3 individual isolates having 
decolourizing ability for three structurally 
different dyes. Materials and Methods  
Dyes and Chemicals  
The azo dyes Direct Red-28 (DR-28), 
Direct Blue-8 (DR-8) and 
triphenylmethane dye Basic green-4 (BG-
4) were obtained from a textile company. 
The chemical structures of dyes DR-28, 
DB-8 & BG-4 are shown in (Fig.1). The 
dyes were selected on the basis of their 
structural diversity and frequent use in 
local textile industries. The media 
components and chemicals were 
purchased from Himedia 
Labs,Bombay,India. All chemicals used 
were of analytical grade.   
Growth me dium  
The pure cultures of CR1,CR2 &CR3 
isolated from soil samples collected from 
dye polluted areas and textile mill 
effluents were grown in 250 ml 
Erlenmeyer flask,containing 100 nutrient 
broth[(g l-1) : Peptone 10,NaCl 5, Yeast 
extract 2 and beef extract] at 30Â±2C for 
24 hrs under static condition.  
Development of Bacterial Consortia   
The consortium was developed with the 
selected isolates by aseptically transferring 
1ml of 24hrs cultures (3.6x109 Cfuml-1) of 
each in a 250 ml conical flask contaioning 
100 ml of nutrient broth, PH 7.0 and 
incubated at 37C for 24 hrs under static 
conditions. A 1% v/v aliquots of the 
culture mix were then transferred into a 
250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 
ml of nutrient broth with100 ppm of dyes 
DR-28,DB-8 and BG-4 respectively. The 
cell suspensions of individual isolates was 
also run along with the consortium with 
the respective dyes. Suitable control was 
maintained without any inoculum. Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(11): 218-226

Decolourization Assay  
The conical flasks containing the cell 
suspension of individual isolates and 
consortium PVN-5 were completely 
sealed, so as to achieve anoxic conditions. 
The uninoculated control was also 
incubated under same conditions to check 
the abiotic decolourization of the dye. The 
autoclaved cells of consortium PVN-5 
were also incubated to study the 
decolourization due to adsorption of dye. 
The samples were withdrawn at every 12 
hrs for 6 days, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm 
for 15 min.   
The supernatant of the centrifuged samples 
were read at absorbance maximum ( 
max) of the dyes as per Colour Index 
International(1992) ie.,500nm for DR-28, 
560nm for DB-8 and 614nm for BG-4 
using spectrophotometer. The cell pellet 
was resuspended in equal volume of 
ethanol to extract the dye absorbed to cell 
surface. The methanol sample was 
centrifuged and supernatant aws read at  
max of dyes used. The uninoculated dye 
free medium was used as blank. All assays 
were performed in triplicates and 
compared with respective uninoculated 
control.The flasks were observed for 10 
days to assess the maximum 
decolourization (data not shown). The 
decolourization percentage was calculated 
as follows  :

Where,(I) is the initial dye concentration 
and Dye (r) is the residual dye 
concentration Result and Discussion  
Decolourization by livi ng cells  
The results in Fig.2-4 shows that the living 
cells of PVN-5 were able to completely 
decolourize DR-28, DB-8 and BG-4 in 24, 
24 & 36 hrs respectively.Since the 
eventual fraction of methanol-extractable 
dye is very negligible, the results clearly 
indicate that the overall decolourization of 
DR-28, DB-8 and BG-4 is due to 
biological mechanisms.  
Decolourization by autoclaved cells   
The results in Fig.2-4 show initial 
decolourization of DR-28,DB-8 & BG-4 
by autoclaved cells of PVN-5 (5%,60% & 
2%) respectively during first 4 hrs; but no 
further significant variation in 
decolourization was observed during the 
next 20 hrs. Extraction with methanol 
recovered the major part of the 
decolourized dye indicating that DB-8 
decolourzation by autoclaved cells of 
PVN-4 is mainly due to 
adsorption.Decolourization by abiotic 
control was not significant in all the 3 dyes 
(Fig.2-4).  
Decolourization of Direct Red -28   
The results presented in Fig.5 show the 
ability of individual isolates , viz 
CR1,CR2,CR3 & consortium PVN-5 to 
decolourize azo dye DR-28. The pure 
cultures of the strains CR1 CR2 &CR3 
showed a maximum of 85.50%,77.88% & 
75.79% respectively at 72 hrs. On the 
other hand consortium PVN-5 achieved 
97% decolourization of DR-28 in 12 hrs 
and complete decolourization in 24 hrs. 
The average decolourization rate of dye 
DR-28 for the consortium PVN-5 was 
significantly higher than that observed for  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(11): 218-226

individual isolates. Khera et al., (2005) 
reported similar observation while 
proceeding the comparative studies on 
potential of consortium & pure bacterial 
isolates.  
Decourization of Direct Blue -8  
The consortium PVN-5 showed a 
maximum decolourization of 95.23% of 
DB-8 in 12 hrs and complete 
decolourization in 24 hrs. The individual 
isolates CR1,CR2 & CR3 showed 
decolourization of about 78.69%,75.62 & 
70.13% respectively (Fig.6).    
Decolourization of Malachite Green  
The dye Basic Green-4 was not 
decolourized significantly by the strains 
CR1,CR2 & CR3 (Fig.7). However the 
consortium PVN-5 achieved complete 
decolourization of the dye Malachite green 
(100ppm) in 36 hrs .Therefore the 
consortium PVN-5 showed maximum 
efficiency in decolourizing the dye Basic 
Green-4 than the individual isolates.  
In this study, the capability of 3 isolates 
CR1,CR2 & CR3 to decolourize 3 dyes 
independently and as a mixed culture 
designated as PVN-5 was evaluated.These 
strains were isolated from soil samples 
collected from dye polluted areas and 
textile mill effluents and consortium PVN-
5 based on these 3 isolates was developed 
and described previously (Saratale et al., 
2009).   
The individual isolates CR1,CR2 & CR3 
were able to decolourize DR-28 & DB-8 
efficiently. However individually the 
strains were not able to decolourize BG-4. 
This variation in decolourization of 3 dyes 
by pure isolates might be due to the 
structural diversity of the dyes used in the 
study (Fig.1). Sani and Banerjee., (1999) reported that dyes with simple structure 
and low molecular weight show higher 
rate of decolourization, whereas 
decolourization of highly substituted, high 
molecular weight dyes are more difficult. 
This is also similar to the report given by 
Chen et al., (2003) of varied colour 
removal capabilities of six bacterial strains 
for structurally and functionally diverse 
dyes belonging to azo group, 
anthraquinone and indigoid groups.  
The versatility of consortium PVN-5 was 
evident from the results as it was able to 
decolourize all the three tested dyes 
completely with varying time. The 
decolourization rate achieved for all the 
individual dyes were significantly higher 
than that of axenic cultures (Table.1). The 
comparision of decolourization potential 
of PVN-5 with abiotic control and 
autoclaved culture proved that the removal 
of Direct Blue-8 by autoclaved cells was 
mainly due to adsorption of dye by the 
biomass; whereas the methanol extraction 
of living cells after complete dye 
decolourization did not result in any dye 
recovery which indicates that the 
decolourization was due to the bacterial 
activity. The higher decolourization 
efficiency of consortium PVN-5 might be 
attributed to the concerted activities of the 
constituent strains. The higher 
decolourization potential due to concerted 
activities of the mixed culture was also 
reported by Nigam et al., (1996).  
The concerted activities of the consortium 
PVN-5 consisting of 3 bacterial strains,viz 
CR1,CR2 & CR3 resulted in increased 
decolorization efficiency as compared to 
that shown by individual strains. The 
consortium was able to decolourize the 
dyes Direct Red -28, Direct Blue -8 & Basic 
Green-4 having diverse structures at a 
faster rate than individual axenic cultures.                                    Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2013) 2(11): 218-226
