ABSTRACT 
 
The adsorption of Cd(II) from aqueous solution usin g Canola biomass was investigated in a batch system . The effect 
of various factors such as contact time, initial co ncentration of Cd(II), amount of adsorbent and size  of  adsorbent 
particles of solution on the adsorption capacity of  Canola biomass was determined. The equilibrium con tact time 
was obtained to be 75 minutes indicating fast adsor ption. The adsorption of Cd(II) on Canola biomass w as observed 
to increase from 3.24 to 25.16 mg/g with increase i n initial Cd(II) concentration from 10 to 100 mg/L.  Kinetic and 
isotherm studies indicate that the adsorption of Cd (II) was best described by the pseudo-second order  kinetic 
equation and Langmuir isotherm equations respective ly. Results obtained indicate that Canola biomass c an be used 
as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of Cd(II)  from aqueous solution.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The tremendous increase in the use of heavy metals over the past few decades has inevitably resulted i n an increased 
flux of metallic substances in aquatic environment.  The metals are of special concern because they are  non-
degradable and therefore persistent. The removal of  toxic heavy metals ions from sewage, industrial an d mining 
waste effluents has been widely studied in recent y ears. Their presence in streams and lakes has been responsible for 
several health problems with animals, plants, and h uman beings. One of the most important toxic metals , cadmium 
finds its way to the water bodies through wastewate rs from metal plating industries and industries of cadmium 
nickel batteries, phosphate fertilizer, mining, pig ments, sl:abilizers and alloys. 
 
Chemical precipitation is the most common conventio nal method of treatment for cadmium containing effl uents but 
large amount of sludge produced during the treatmen t poses disposal problems[1,2]. Ion exchange, vacuu m 
evaporation, solvent extraction, membrane technolog ies, etc[3,4]. are the other well known methods emp loyed for 
treatment of cadmium containing wastewaters[5,6]. P recipitation methods are particularly reliable but require large 
settling tanks for the precipitation of voluminous alkalines sludges and a subsequent treatment is nee ded[7,8]. Ion-
exchange has the advantage of allowing the recovery  of metallic ions, but it is expensive and sophisti cated[9,10]. 
This has encouraged research into discovering mater ials that are both efficient and cheap[11,12]. 
 
Adsorption is an alternative technique for heavy me tal removal[13]. The activated carbon is the most w idely used 
adsorbent material[14]. In fact, use of activated c arbon can be expensive for regeneration required an d at lose of the Davoud Balarak et al Der Pharma Chemica, 2016,8 (12):61-67

62 application processes[15,16]. Many researchers have  been investigating new adsorbent materials for alt ernative to 
activated carbon, such as seaweed, marine algae, cl ays, activated sludge biomass, perlite, maple sawdu st, etc. for the 
removal of heavy metal from wastewater[17,18]. 
 
Canola stalk is one of lignocellulosic wastes that are widely produced in Iran and all of the world du e to the growth 
of the production and consumption of vegetable oils ; therefore, the Canola stalk is easily available a nd due to its 
characteristics has been used in several studies to  remove the pollutants[19-22]. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Cadmium(II) solution was prepared from a reagent gr ade cadmium(II) nitrate salt to meet the concentrat ion 4.45 
mmol/L (500 mg/L) as a stock solution. The solution  was diluted by deionized water to obtain desired s olution for 
adsorption experiments. 
 
Adsorbent 
The Canola waste used as adsorbent in this study wa s obtained of Tabriz agricultural school. The Canol a waste was 
first cut into small pieces, was extensively washed  with tap water to remove adhering dirt and soluble  components 
such as tannins, resins, reducing sugar and colouri ng agents, and then was oven-dried at 50–60 ◦C until constant 
weight. The prepared biomass was then treated with 0.5 M H 2SO 4 for 2 h followed by the washing with distilled 
water and subsequently was oven dried at 105 ℃	for 5 h. The washed and dried material was crushed and sieved to 
obtain a particle size lower than 1.5 mm.  
 
Adsorption experiments 
Batch experiments were carried out at various parti cle size (10–100 mesh), adsorbent dose (0.5–5 g/L),  for a contact 
time of 60 min. For each batch experiment, 100 ml C d(II) solution of 50 mg/L concentration was used. A fter setting 
pH, desired amount of adsorbent was added and the m ixture was agitated on mechanical shaker for 60 min . After 
that the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10  min to separate the adsorbent from supernatant. Th e biosolids 
were then removed by filtration through glass fibre  prefilters (Milipore AP40) and the filtrates were analysed for 
residual cadmium concentration by atomic adsorption  spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer model AA300) with an air–
acetylene flame. Cadmium hollow cathode  lamp was u sed. 
 
All experiments were replicated thrice for all the adsorbents and results were averaged. The removal p ercentage 
(R%) of cadmium was calculated for each run by foll owing expression[23,24]: 
 
R= 	()×

where C 0  and C e  were the initial and final concentration of cadmi um in the solution. The adsorption capacity of an 
adsorbent which is obtained from the mass balance o n the sorbate in a system with solution volume V is  often used 
to acquire the experimental adsorption isotherms. U nder the experimental conditions, the adsorption ca pacities of all 
the adsorbents for each concentration of cadmium (I I) ions at equilibrium were calculated by[25,26]:

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Effect of adsorbent dose and particle size: The removal of Cd(II) with Canola biomass was studi ed at different  
dose (0.5–5 g/L) with keeping Cd(II) concentration (50 mg/L), stirring speed (200 rpm), pH (7.0) and c ontact time 
(75 min) constant. The results (Fig. 1) indicate th at increase in adsorbent dose resulted in a higher removal of Cd(II). 
Maximum removal was observed at adsorbent dose of 3  g/L. The increase in the percentage removal with i ncrease in 
the adsorbent dosage is due to the increase in the number of adsorption sites[27-29]. The adsorption c apacity was 
lesser at higher adsorbent doses (Fig. 1). This may  be attributed to overlapping or aggregation of ads orption sites 
resulting in decrease in total adsorbent surface ar ea available to metal ions and an increase in diffu sion path 
length[30,31].

63 Fig. 2 shows the effect of particle size on the ads orption of Cd(II) by Canola biomass. It is seen tha t the removal of 
Cd(II) increases as the particle size diameter decr eases. Decrease in particle size increases the perc entage removal 
due to increase in surface area as well as micro po re volume[32,33]. 
 
Effect of Initial Concentration and Contact Time  
The effect of initial Cd(II) concentration and cont act time on the adsorption of Cd(II) is shown in Fi g. 3. It could be 
seen that the amount of Cd(II) adsorbed per unit ma ss of adsorbent increased with the increase in init ial 
concentration and contact time until equilibrium wa s reached at about 75 min. However, the percent Cd( II) removal 
decreased with the increase in initial concentratio n. Fig. 3 also shows rapid adsorption of Cd(II) in the first 45 min 
for all initial concentrations, and thereafter the adsorption rates decreased gradually till it reache d equilibrium. The 
higher rate of adsorption at the beginning was due to large available surface area of the biosorbent a nd after the 
capacity of the biosorbent gets exhausted (i.e. at equilibrium), the rate of uptake is controlled by t he rate at which the 
sorbate is transported from the exterior to the int erior sites of the biosorbent particles[34-36].

Adsorption Isotherm 
Two sorption isotherms, the Langmuir and Freundlich  models were used to fit the experimental sorption data. 
 
Langmuir model is based on monolayer sorption and c an be described by the following equation[37,38]:  
 
Ce/q e = 1/q max b+(1/q max )C e.   
 
It assumes that the uptake of metal ions occur on a  homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption without interaction 
between adsorbed ions. This means that there are un iform energies of adsorption on the surface. The La ngmuir 
constant q max , obtained by plotting C e/q e against C e is used to compare the performance of adsorbents.  For a good 
adsorbent, a  high  q max  is  desirable. The q max  for the pinecone is 25.86 mg/g. Thus, the pinecone  is a good 
adsorbent. Similar results were obtained for the ad sorption of Cd(II) ions using low cost adsorbents [ 11,12]. 
Adsorption coefficient, b (L/mg) relates to the app arent energy of adsorption. The lower the value of b, the more 
favourable the adsorption will be. The b and  R L values (as shown in Table 1) of Cd(II) show that t he adsorption is 
favourable. 
 
The Freundlich model is based on multilayer sorptio n and is given by the following equation[39,40]: 
 
log q e =logK f +1/nlog C e,   
 
Where q e is the equilibrium sorption (mg/g) amount of Cd(II ) adsorbed on Canola biomass, C e is the equilibrium 
concentration of the adsorbate in aqueous solution (mg/L), K f is a constant determined by plotting C e/q e versus C e. 
Kf and 1/n are constants related to the sorption of ad sorbent and intensity of the sorption respectively.  Freundlich 
isotherm is used to estimate the adsorption intensi ty of the adsorbent towards the adsorbate by assumi ng that the 
adsorption occurs on a heterogeneous surface by mul tilayer sorption and that the amount of adsorbate a dsorbed 
increases infinitely with increasing concentration.  According to Balarak, n values between 1 and 10 re present 
favourable adsorption[19]. From the study, the n va lue of Cd(II) on Canola biomass suggests that the a dsorption is 
favourable at studied conditions. 
 
The experimental sorption data was more suited to t he Freundlich isotherm with R 2 value of 0.943. This shows that 
the Freundlich model was able to adequately describ e the relationship between C e and q e for the Cd(II). The 
calculated isotherm constants and correlation coeff icients of Langmuir and Freundlich models are liste d in the Table 
1 below. 
 
Error Functions  
The usual way to validate the isotherms is to consi der the goodness-of-fit using the linear regression  coefficients, R2. 
However, using only the linear regression method ma y not be appropriate for comparing the goodness of fit of 
different isotherms. This is because an occurrence of the inherent bias resulting from linearization  may affect  the 
deduction. Therefore, in this study in addition to the linear regression analysis, the experimental da ta were tested 0510 15 20 25 30

65 with two non-linear error functions: the sum-of-squ are error  (SSE) and Chi square ( χ2) to determine the best fitting 
isotherm. The error functions are given[41,42]:

χ2  =∑  
  
 
The higher the value of  R 2 and lower  the values of error functions, the bett er is the goodness of-fit and therefore the 
applicability of the isotherm model. The values of these error functions obtained are given in Table 1 . From the R 2 
values and the results of the error  analysis, Lang muir isotherm gave the best description of the Cano la 
biomass/Cd(II) adsorption system, as it presented t he highest linear regression value (0.998), and the  lowest values 
for the other two error functions (Table 1).

Adsorption Kinetics:  In order to study the adsorption of CD(II) onto Can ola biomass and to interpret the results, 
experimental data obtained were fitted to different  kinetic models such as the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second 
order. 
 
The rate constant of adsorption is determined from pseudo first-order equation given by Lagergren, whi ch is 
expressed as[43,44] 
 
Log (q e− qt) = log q e−

. 
 
 where q e and q t  are the amounts of the Cd(II) adsorbed (mg/g) at e quilibrium and at time t (min), respectively, and 
k 1 is the rate constant adsorption (min –1). Values of k 1 and q e calculated from slope and the intercept of the plo t of 
log (q e–qt ) versus t at different concentrations are given  in Table 3. The results show that the values of R2 were low 
and the experimental q e values do  not agree well with the calculated valu es (q e, cal). This shows that the adsorption 
of the CD(II) onto Canola biomass does not follow f irst-order kinetics.  
 
 The pseudo second-order equation based on equilibr ium adsorption can be expressed as[45,46]; 
 

 	=	
 +
 t 
 
where, k 2 (g/mg·min) is the adsorption rate constant of pseu do second-order adsorption rate. The value of q e and k 2 
can be obtained from the slope and intercept of  th e plot of t/q t versus t respectively. The results show for all 
different initial concentrations of CD(II) studied with very high values of R 2 (Table 2) in addition to the good 
agreement between experimental and calculated value s of q e. Therefore, it can be said that the pseudo second- order 
kinetic model provided a good correlation for the a dsorption of CD(II) onto Canola biomass in contrast  to the 
pseudo first-order model.

CONCLUSION 
 
The present study investigated the adsorption of CD (II) from aqueous solution using Canola biomass in a batch 
system. Adsorption of CD(II) by Canola biomass is a ffected by operational parameters such as contact t ime, initial 
CD(II) concentration, adsorbent dosage and adsorben t particles. The equilibrium contact time was obtai ned as 75 
min indicating that the adsorption process was a fa st kinetic process. Kinetic and isotherm studies in dicate that the 
adsorption of CD(II) was best described by the pseu do-second order kinetic equation and Langmuir isoth erm 
equations respectively. This study has demonstrated  that the low cost Canola biomass can be widely use d for 
removal of CD(II) from aqueous solution.
