2 nano-photocatalyst is synthesized via sol-gel technique and photo-
catalytic degradation of phenol has been studied under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation in a fluidized bed reactor. Various techniques are used to characterize TiO
2 nano-photocatalyst such as X-Ray 
Diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy. Based on the results, carbon is introduced into titania structure leading to enhanced response towards visible light. Response surface methodology is used to model the effect of various parameters such as pollutant concentration, pH, irradiation time, photo-catalyst content and Carbon to TiO
2 molar ratio. The optimum degradation occurs at pH=9, catalyst content=2.5 (g/L), initial phenol 
concentration=100 (mg/L), C to TiO2 molar ratio=2.5 and irradiation time=180 min. The results show that 
phenol photo-catalytic degradation kinetics follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood model very closely at optimal conditions. Phenol degradation is 75 % under ultraviolet irradiation during a 180 min period and 70 % under visible irradiation during a 420 min period. Based on the results, C-TiO
2 nano-photocatalyst can be a good 
option for phenol removal under visible light irradiation.

INTRODUCTION
The fast growing world population and 
reduction of drinking water resources has brought 
about serious concerns about reliable drinking water supplies throughout the world. Water shortage due to the ever-increasing environmental pollution has made the availability of potable water one of the fundamental problems in today’s world and diseases emanated from this pollution threatens the lives of many people. However, water recycling provides access to a viable water resource for a variety of applications [1]. 
Various pollutants are found in wastewaters 
such as methylene blue [2], acid green 16 [3], dodecyl benzene sulfonate [4], phenol [5], etc. Phenol and phenolic compounds are among the most serious water contaminants [5], introduced by industrial waste streams such as petrochemical effluents, petroleum refineries and rubber, plastics, adhesive, resin and insecticide manufacturers. These compounds present in industrial effluents can cause genotoxicity in the roots of plants [6]. Although, phenol does not remain in the environment for long, constant release of this compound results in its accumulation in water, air and soil [7]. Phenol is highly toxic even at low concentrations; thus leading to serious damages to the human nervous system. It has also a 
high affinity to cholorine producing choloro-
phenol derivatives as compounds more toxic and resilient toward degradation. As a result, phenol removal from industrial effluents using an effective, efficient and affordable method is an 
essential task [8]. 
Various methods such as adsorption by 
activated carbon [9], chemical oxidation [10] and biological treatment [11] have been used to treat phenol or phenol-like compounds, which suffer certain drawbacks like time-consuming and expensive operation and also possible production

of toxic by-products. Therefore, alternatives seem 
to be vital for the removal of phenol and phenolic compounds [12].
Unique properties of photo-catalytic 
processes including complete decomposition of 
pollutant to water and carbon dioxide, simple equipment and high performance in a short period have attracted research attentions recently. Photo-catalytic degradation is started by the absorption of a photon (hυ) with energy equal to or greater than the semiconductor band-gap, electron (e
-) 
promotion from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) and formation of a hole (h
+) in the valence band (VB). Holes can react 
with water and produce hydroxyl radicals with a high redox oxidizing potential. On the other hand, electron conduction band reacts with oxygen and produce O
-
2 (Fig.1). O-
2 is also converted to hydroxyl 
radicals upon subsequent reactions, which are responsible for transformation of toxic pollutants to water and carbon dioxide [13]. Photo-catalytic degradation of phenol (Eq. 1) is widely assumed by the following reactions:

Various nanomaterials and nano-composits are 
recently introduced as novel photo-catalysts [14]. TiO
2 [15], ZnO [16], WO3, ZrO2 and Fe2O3 [17] are 
used for photo-catalytic degradation of various pollutants [15]. Iqbal et al. used ZnO nanoparticles for degradation of nonyl-phenol ethoxylate under UV and solar irradiation [16]. TiO
2 nanostructures 
possess properties such as chemical stability, non-toxicity, low cost and high optical activity while suffering certain shortcomings like high speed electron-hole recombination rate and passivity in the wavelength range>400 nm, which is usually overcome by doping of TiO
2 
with metals and nonmetals [18]. Table 1 shows a variety of dopants used in other studies in order to enhance the photo-catalytic activity of titania. Based on Table 1 and the results of other research activities on carbon-doped TiO
2 nanoparticles 
wrapped with nano-graphene [19] and carbon/nitrogen-doped TiO
2 [20] for phenol degradation 
under visible light, it can be concluded that carbon is considered as a dopant giving high degradation rates in the solar irradiation range which proposes C-TiO
2 nanoparticles as the 
candidate selected in this study. Doping strategy is performed through various techniques such as hydrolysis [21], hydrothermal [22], oxidation [23] and sol-gel [24]. Sol-gel technique is used in this study due to simple  procedure,  lack of need 
for special equipment and viability of various 
products [25]. Based on our literature review, C-TiO
2 is not used for photo-catalytic removal of 
phenol from aqueous phase up to now.
Recently, RSM is more extensively used as a 
statistical tool for modeling and optimization parameters that influence photo-catalytic degradation [39]. RSM is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques for empirical model building. The objective is to optimize a response

(output variable) influenced by several independent 
variables (input variables), aimed at the reduction of cost for expensive analysis methods [40].
In this study, C-doped TiO
2 nanoparticles were 
produced by sol-gel technique and used for photo-catalytic degradation of phenol. Furthermore, the impact of effective parameters on phenol removal such as pH, pollutant concentration, catalyst content, C to TiO
2 molar ratio and irradiation 
time were optimized using RSM investigated under UV and visible light irradiation. Langmuir-Hinshelwood model is also used to calculate the reaction rate constants.

Experimental Section
- Synthesis of Carbon-doped TiO
2 nanoparticles
In this research, C-TiO2 nanoparticles are 
produced by modified sol-gel technique. First, a 
solution of CA and EG is prepared and Ti (OPri)4 
and nitric acid are added to the initial solution. Finally, ammonia is added to the solution to set 
pH at a 6-7 value. Molar ratios have been fixed 
as: [CA/Ti, /CA، CA/EG] = [2:1, 1:3, 1:2]. The sol temperature is set at 90℃ , so that gelation is initialized and then baked at 110˚C. The Xerogel is formed and the porous grey powder is calcined at 600˚C for 2 h in the atmosphere [41]. A schematic of the synthesis procedure is shown in Fig. 2.
- Characterization of C-doped TiO
2 nanoparticles
Properties of the C-doped TiO2 nanoparticles 
have been evaluated by various techniques. XRD 
and EDX analyses are used to determine the size 
and phase of doped titania, respectively. In order to ensure TiO
2 nanoparticles being doped with 
carbon, FTIR technique is employed and FE-SEM analysis is also applied to reveal the morphology and structure.Table 1: Various dopants and their properties.

-  Photo-catalytic Reactor
The photo-reactor used for the removal of 
phenol is schematically shown in Fig. 3. This 
reactor consists of three coaxial tubes. The inner tube is made of quartz and placed at the 
center of the fluidized bed reactor with an inside UV lamp (8W). The other tubes are made of pyrex. 
The sample solution is placed between the inner and the middle tubes and the outer tube is used to control the reaction temperature at 30˚C. The lamp has a maximum intensity at the light wavelength equal to 254 nm. The solar irradiation experiment was also carried out under xenon light (338 nm).
- Design of Experiments by Response Surface 
methodology (RSM)
Various parameters such as pH, pollutant 
concentration, C to TiO
2 molar ratio, catalyst 
content and irradiation time are assumed to influence phenol degradation. In this research, the variation range for each parameter is considered and various experiments are designed using RSM (Table 2). The relationship between these parameters and the response (dependent parameter) can be described by an empirical second-order polynomial as follows:OH

i and  xj are the coded values for the 
experimental parameters. The experimental design data were also analyzed using Design-Expert (DX9 MFC Application) software.
- Phenol Removal Experiments
Various concentrations of phenol solution are 
mixed with nano-photocatalysts (various molar 
ratios) in the photo-catalytic reactor. In order to determine the optimum value, each test is performed in the 3-11 pH range (adjusted by NaOH (0.2 M) and HCl (0.3 M)). The photo-catalyst is prepared with 3 different molar ratios and degradation of phenol is performed under UV and solar irradiation. Photo-catalysts are centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm and the remaining phenol solution is analyzed using fluorescence spectrometry at 200-700 nm. Absorbance at 299 nm is used to determine phenol concentration. Phenol removal is then given by Eq. (4) as a function of time:
                                                                                (3)

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of C-TiO2 nano-photocatalyst
- XRD Analysis
In order to investigate the crystal structure 
and size and ensure the synthesis of C-doped TiO
2 nanoparticles, X-ray diffraction is used. 
Fig. 4 shows the diffraction pattern of pure and C-doped TiO
2. Based on Fig. 4, the peak intensity 
is increased compared with pure Titania, which indicates carbon doping. The size of C-doped TiO
2 
nano-crystallites can be obtained using Debye-Scherer equation:                                                                                        (5)OH

(crystalline) domains, λ is the X-ray wavelength 
(1.54×10-10), K is a dimensionless  shape factor (with a typical value of ~ 0.9), β is  the line broadening 
at half the maximum intensity (FWHM) and θ is 
the Bragg angle. According to equation (5), the 
crystallite size is estimated to be ~ 28 nm.
- FTIR Analysis
FTIR pattern of pure and C-doped TiO2 
nanoparticles in the range of 200-3700 cm-1 are 
shown in Fig. 5. The peak at 525.6 cm-1 shows 
the stretching vibration of Ti-O and the peak at 
1423.08 cm-1 is related to hydrocarbon groups. 
The peak at 2923.08 cm-1 indicates the presence 
of C-H functional group and the peak at 3438.08 indicates the amine group (-OH) [42]. C-doped TiO
2 has an extra peak at 525.6 cm-1 confirming 
the presence of Ti-O bond in this sample. Also, the peaks of hydrocarbons, functional group of C-H and amines are observed in the pattern of C-doped TiO
2 at a different position compared 
with pure titania resulting in peak shift.

Where A, B, C and D are the coded values for 
process variables pH, phenol concentration (ppm, 
catalyst content (g/L) and time (min).
According to Table 4, R-squared value of 0.9680 
(close to unity) indicates good predictability of the model and Adj. R-Squared for the selected model is equal to 0.9188. 
The difference between R-Squared and Adj. 
R-Squared values is less than 0.2 representing the suitability of data fit. The Pred. R-Squared obtained is 0.7578 which is acceptable. Herein, the signal to noise ratio estimated by “Adeq. Precision” parameter was equal to 14.829, where ratios > 4 indicate adequate discrimination. 
The ANOVA table gives the analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) for response quadratic model (Table 5). P-values < 0.05 indicate the significance of model terms and values > 0.05 confirm significance. In this study, pH, phenol concentration (ppm), catalyst content (g/L), irradiation time (min) and the interaction of the terms were investigated. The Model F-value of 19.66 and a p-value < 0.0001 implies the model significance. Fig. 8 shows a good agreement between the predicted and actual results.Effective parameters on photo-catalytic degradation-  Solution pH
According to Fig. 9, the rate of removal of phenol 
is increasing by increasing pH value. Also, the 
maximum efficiency occurs at pH ≈ 9. The efficiency is very low in the acidic range and enhanced in the alkaline pH range since phenol occurs in the form of phenoxide ions as more reactive compounds 
leading to stronger interaction with radicals. Another reason is also the high concentration of hydroxide in the alkaline pH range [45]. The rate of removal of phenol is constant at pH>9

because high pH creates favorable conditions 
for the formation of carbonate ions as good OH- 
scavengers keeping decomposition rate constant. Also, a large increase in the concentration of hydroxyl ions acts as a barrier against penetration of light into the solution [46]. 
Figs. 10 (a), (b) & (c), show three dimensional 
(3-D) response surface plots of removal (%) vs. variables. The influence of pH, phenol 
concentration (ppm), catalyst content (g/L) and irradiation time (min) on the removal (%) as a response factor are visualized in the 3-D response surface plots.-  Phenol concentration
Effect of phenol concentration on the removal 
rate is shown in Fig. 11. According to this Fig, the rate of removal of phenol is reducing by increasing phenol concentration. Increased phenol concentration induces competition among hydroxyl oxidizing agents leading to the reduction of removal efficiency [42].
-  Catalyst Content
The rate of removal of phenol is increased 
by increasing the amount of catalyst due to the 
enhancement of production rate of hydroxyl

oxidizing agent. Upon reaching a maximum value, 
further increase in catalyst content leads to the reduction of photo-degradation efficiency because catalyst particles are agglomerated preventing light penetration (Fig. 12) [48]. The highest rate of removal of phenol (50 %) occurs at a catalyst content = 2.5 g/L.- Irradiation Time
Fig. 13 shows the growth of removal rate by 
increasing the irradiation time. The reaction rate is decreased by increasing irradiation time due to the enhancement of competition between initial reactants and intermediates over time, which results in reduced reaction of free radicals with nanoparticles [49].- C to TiO
2 molar ratio
In this research, C-TiO2 nanoparticles were 
synthesized with different molar ratios. The results show that different dopant molar ratios have little impact on removal efficiency. All catalysts almost show the same removal rate. Also, increasing or decreasing the carbon content of the composite is ineffective on the removal rate of phenol which suggests lower carbon contents as economical.
Optimization of parameters
A test at optimal conditions was performed under 
UV and visible light irradiation with conditions shown 
in Table 6. Fluorescence spectra of UV and visible irradiation are shown in Figs. 14(a & b) and 15(a, b

obtained with the slope as the apparent kinetic

CONCLUSIONS
In this study, degradation of phenol using 
C-TiO2 as a nano-photocatalyst has been studied. 
Uniform nanoparticles are synthesized through sol-gel technique with spherical shape with an average ~20 nm size. Photo-catalytic activity of TiO
2 nanoparticles is improved by carbon doping, 
bringing the photo-catalytic activity in the visible light range. Photo-catalytic degradation of phenol is increased in alkaline environments compared to neutral and acidic conditions, with 75% phenol degradation under UV and 30% under solar irradiation in a 180 min period.  
Table 7 shows the results of other studies 
compared to this study. The results show the efficiency of C-TiO
2 in comparison with other 
equivalents for phenol removal both from removal point of view and also irradiation period. Based on the results, other dopants can be examined for enhancement of phenol removal or the removal of other more recalcitrant pollutants present in wastewater effluents.
