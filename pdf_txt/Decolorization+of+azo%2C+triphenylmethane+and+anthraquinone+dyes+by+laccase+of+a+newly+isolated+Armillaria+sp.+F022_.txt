Abstract  8 
The long- term stability of aerobic granules is critical for decolourization of different dyes in textile 9 
wastewater.  Here, we investigated dye decolourization and the stability of acetate -cultivated 10 
granules after exposure to dyes . Results show that granules can maintain excellent structure stability 11 
with the presence of azo and triphenylmethane dyes during a 200-day operation period, achieving 12 
biomass concentration s as high as  8-12 g/L and 90% and 100% decolourization efficiency, 13 
respectively. Aerobic granules, however, partially disintegrated after exposure to anthraquinone , 14 
resulting in dye decolourization efficiency ranging from 50 -80% and a biomass concentration as low 15 
as around 0.5 g/L due to biomass wash -out. The study indicate s that long- term granule stability is 16 
much  dependent on the dye classes. The enrichment of specific species in granules for dye 17 
decolourization has not been affected by the granule structure. The specific dye decolourization rate 18 
and dye to microorganism  ratio for anthraquinone were 5 -6.5 and 13.5- 16.4 times , respectively,  19 
higher than those for azo and triphenylmethane dyes , but the total reactor performance for 20 
anthraquinone decolourization is much poorer than  azo and triphenylmethane dyes due to low 21 
bioma ss retention in the reactor. Th e results suggest the importance of stability of aerobic granules 22 
for biomass retention to achieve  better  treatment performance of dye-containing wastewater. For 23 
the first time, the long -term stability and decolourization per formance of aerobic granules for 24 
treating anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes are reported here and compared with azo dye, 25 
which can be used to guide the treatment of real textile wastewater containing azo, anthraquinone 26 
and triphenylmethane dyes by ae robic granules.  27

 1. INTRODUCTION  32 
Synthetic reactive dyes from the  textile industry ha ve caused a serious concern to water eco systems 33 
due to their recalcitrant and toxic natures . It has been reported that more than 280 ,000  t of textile 34 
dyes are annually discharged in textile industrial effluents worldwide  (Maas and Chaudhari, 2005) . 35 
Based on the chromophoric group ’s chemical structure , dyes are classified as azo, anthraquinone, 36 
triphenylmethane, heterocyclic and polymeric dyes (Hadibarata et al., 2012) , among which azo, 37 
anthraquinone and triphenylmethane account for most textile dyestuffs produced.   38 
  39 
To alleviate environment al pollution and severe  health risk  of dyes , physical, chemical and biological 40 
methods have been developed to treat dye- containing  wastewater. Compared with physical and 41 
chemical technologies, biological approach is more environmentally friendly and cost -effective , and it 42 
is thus believed promising to decolorize and degrade dyes in wastewater standalone  (Popli and Patel, 43 
2015)  or to be integrated with advanced oxidation for complete mineralization  (Rodrigues et al., 2014) . 44 
Different strains have been isolated to decolorize or degrade dyes in different conditions such as 45 
anaerobic, microaerobic, aerobic or alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Consortium s have 46 
been proved to be more efficient in treating dye-containing wastewater (Waghmode et al., 2011; 47 
Mishra and Maiti, 2018) . In practice , however , acclimatized sludge with mixed culture is most 48 
promising to treat dye -contain ing wastewater because it could be operated for  a long period without 49 
much concern s about the wash -out of specific strains from treatment system s and continuous 50 
frequent inoculation . Aerobic granular sludge as a kind of biomass retention technology has att racted 51 
strong attention for dye -containing wastewater treatment since 2010. The compact structure and 52 
large size of granules allow them to withstand toxic compound shock and unfavourable environmental 53 
conditions . Meanwhile, more diverse microbial populatio n could be enriched for more efficient 54 
pollutant removal.    55 
 56 
To use aerobic granular sludge to decolour ise or to degrade dyes, some researchers developed 57 
granules from suspended sludge with azo dye containing wastewater. It has been  demonstrated  58 
widely that aerobic granules can be formed easily with azo dyes at low concentration s such as 50 mg/L 59 
mixed with other readily biodegradable carbon sources such glucose, starch, acetate or ethanol. For 60 
example, Muda et al. (2010)  reported the development of stable , mature  and well -settled AG within 61 
a 65-day operation  with a mixture of external carbon sources such as glucose, ethanol and acetate 62 
with a COD concentration of 1270 mg/L in the presence s of a mixture of three azo dyes with a total 50 63 
mg/L concentration under intermittent anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Mata et al. (2015)  reported 64 
better g ranulation results with the addition of 20 mg/L azo dye AR14 into synthetic wastewater with starch 65 
as carbon source (COD concentration of 1000 mg/L) in non -tubular SBR in their 62 -day experiment .  66 3 
 Ibrahim et al. (2010)  and Kee et al. (2015)  developed granules  from a mixture of bacterial species isolated 67 
from textile sludge or soil contaminated with textile wastewater and sterilised activated sludge fed with 68 
real dyeing wastewater. To some extent, the formation of granules with the presence of l ow concentration 69 
of azo dyes is not surprising because aerobic granules have been developed with synthetic wastewater 70 
containing acetate  or glucose  at the presence of other types of recalcitrant toxic compounds (Maszenan et 71 
al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011) . Furthermore, aerobic granules could even be developed wi th toxic compounds 72 
such as phenol (Jiang et al., 2002)  and tert-butyl alcohol (Zhuang et al., 2005)  as a sole carbon source, let 73 
alone granulation with readily biodegradable carbon source s mixed with low concentrations  of other types 74 
of recalcitrant and toxic compounds such as dyes . Although granulation was studies with the presence of 75 
azo dye, there still lack evidence  on granulation with the presence of anthraquinone and triphenylmethane , 76 
anothe r two main classes of dyes widely used in textile industry , and on how efficiently they could be 77 
decolorized or degraded by granules .   78 
 79 
With more commercial applications of aerobic granules for municipal wastewater treatment (Pronk et al., 80 
2015) , a more efficient and rapid way to start up a new reactor for dye containing wastewater treatment 81 
is to inoculate  excessive granular sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants. The stability of 82 
aerobic granules after exposure  to different operati ng conditions with dyes ’ presence  becomes more 83 
critical for stable dye decolourization and minimization.  The instability of aerobic granules for dye 84 
treatment ha s been observed in some studies . Sadri Moghaddam and Alavi Moghaddam (2016)  reported 85 
that after successful granulation with synthetic wastewater containing  50 mg/L azo dye acid red 18 in SBR, 86 
the increase in the azo dye concentration from 50 to 100 mg/L on day 60 immediately caused the 87 
disintegration of aerobic granules into smaller -sized filamentous flocs and SVI rose  increase  to 340 ml/g, 88 
indicating an unfavourable effect of dye concentration on the aerobic granules’ structure stability and 89 
characteristics . The disintegration of aerobic granules in this study might be caused by the sudden shock 90 
of azo dye from 50 to 100 mg/L. Muda  et al. (2011)  operated one reactor for around 300 days with varying 91 
HRT for wastewater with the presence of a total of 50 mg/L concentration of mixed azo dyes. They reported 92 
that the decrease in granule size with a percentage smaller  than 300 µ m increa sed from less than 15% at 93 
the beginning to more than 50% at the end of reactor operation, which they attributed to the extension of 94 
HRT over the time. The decrease in granule size  over time  showed the variability  and instability of granule 95 
characteristics over the long -term operation period , but it is unclear if this was caused by operati ng 96 
conditions only or by the presence of dyes.  Franca et al. (2015 ) operated two SBRs in parallel with one 97 
added with 20 mg/L azo dye and the other as the control without  dye and observed that from 77 days the 98 
granules/flocs ratio in the dye -fed SBR2 slightly increased, even after increasing dye concentration from 20 99 
to 60 mg/L whilst total granule disintegration was observed in the dye -free control SBR1. Although the 100 
disintegrations of granules in SBR1 was unexplainable, we could see that the presence of azo dye from 20 101 
to 60mg/L did not negatively affect granule stab ility compared with the control. Most aerobic granule 102 4 
 studies for dye treatment were operated for short period s such as 2 -3 months . It is thus hard to know if 103 
granule s can maintain their  structur al stab ility for a long time with dyes ’ presence .  104 
 105 
So far, a lmost all studies on dye decolourization and degradation by using aerobic granules focused on azo 106 
dye only. In practice, however, real textile wastewater likely contains azo, anthraquinone and 107 
triphenylmethane dyes. To apply aerobic granules for real textile wastewater treatment, we need to 108 
answer  another two essential and important research questions apart from granulation.  The first question 109 
is if the granules can withstand toxic and recalcitrant dye compounds for long periods after being exposed  110 
to dyes ,  by maintainto maintaining  intact granule structure and stable reactor performance. The second 111 
question is if the effects of different classes of dyes on granule stability are the same. Although azo dye is 112 
dominant  in textile wastewater, the presence of other classes  of dyes such as anthraquinone and 113 
triphenylmethane is unavoidable  sometimes. Regarding the long- term stability of granules with the 114 
presence of dyes especially with different chemical structures, it would be worth determining how each 115 
class of dye affects granule structure first. Furthermore, if granules cultivated by benign wastewater  such 116 
as municipal wastewater could  be inoculated to start up reactors for textile wastewater treatment, it  would 117 
be much  more efficient  from the application point of view .  118 
 119 
This study therefore aims to acclimatize acetate -cultivated granules for dye decolourisation, to evaluate 120 
the long- term stability of aerobic granules after being exposed to  individual azo, anthraquinone and 121 
triphenylmethane dyes, and to compare the decolourization efficiency of three different dyes by aerobic 122 
granules in the similar conditions . The ultimate goal of this study is to explore the application potential and 123 
operation practice of aerobic granules for the treatment of real textile wastewater  containing multiple 124 
classes of dyes.    125 
  126 
 127 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  128 
2.1 Medium  129 
To cultivate aerobic granules, synthetic wastewater with the following composition was used: COD 130 
(sodium acetate) 1000  mg lL-1, NH 4Cl 115 mg Ll-1, K2HPO 4 45 mg L l-1, CaCl 2∙2H 2O 30 mg Ll-1, 131 
MgSO 4∙7H 2O 25 mg L l-1, FeSO 4∙7H 2O 20 mg L l-1, and trace elements same as those used by Chen et al. 132 
(2015) . After aerobic granular sludge reached steady state, reactive azo dye, i.e. , Acid Red 14 133 
(Chromotrope FB, Sigma- Aldrich, 50% dye content), triphenylmethane dye, i.e. , Brilliant Green 134 
(Sigma -Aldrich, 90% dye content), and anthraquinone dye , i.e., Reactive Blue 19  (Remazol Brilliant 135 
Blue  R, Sigma -Aldrich) was added , respectively , to the above -mentioned synthetic wastewater to 136 
simulate wastewater  containing different class es of dye . The dye concentration was increased step - 137 5 
 wise from 5 to 85 mg /L-1 during th e long- term operation period to investigate dye decolourisation 138 
and granule stability.  139 
 140 
2.2 Reactor operation for the cultivation of aerobic granules  141 
Three bubble columns were used to cultivate aerobic granules with an internal reactor diameter of 142 
6.5 cm and a working volume of 2.5 L. Fine air bubbles for aeration were supplied through an air 143 
sparger at the reactor bottom to all reactors. The reactor s were operated sequentially  at ambient 144 
temperature  with a cycle time of  4 h, which included 5 min of influent filling, 22 8 min of aeration, 2  145 
min of settling and 5 min of effluent discharging from the  middle port of the reactor with a volumetric 146 
exchange ratio of 50% . This operation resulted in  8 -hr hydraulic retention time  (HRT). A 147 
programmable logic  controller was installed to  achieve the automatic cyclic operation  of the reactors .  148 
2.3 Reactor operation for dye decolourisation using microbial granules  149 
After aerobic granules reached steady state in the three bubble columns  with a biomass concentration 150 
of 3.4 g  /L-1, the wastewater was shifted to synthetic wastewater containing dye. Meanwhile, the cycle 151 
time was extended to 6 hours with the same feeding, settling and discharging times, but the reaction 152 
time in the cycles was divided into an anaerobic phase with nitrogen rate of 0.5 L  /min-1 from 5 to 180 153 
minutes and an aerobic p hase from 180 to 35 3 minutes with aeration rate of 3.0 L /min-1 for dye 154 
decolourisation.  HRT was extended to 12 hours accordingly due to the extension of cycle time.  155 
Reactors fed with wastewater containing Acid Red 14 , Brilliant Green or Reactive Blue 19  in this study 156 
were denoted as R1, R2 and R3, respectively.  157 
 158 
2.4 Analytical methods  159 
Chemical oxygen demand (COD), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) , sludge volume index (SVI30) 160 
and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) , and t otal organic carbon  (TOC) were analysed in 161 
accordance to standard methods (Eaton et al., 2005) . Sludge volume index (SVI 5) was measured in a 162 
similar manner as SVI30 by modifying the settling time from 30 to 5 min. For reactors with aerobic 163 
granules, MLSS in the reactors was calculated from biomass density  and biomass bed  volume  164 
measured according to Beun et al. (1999) .    165 
The wavelength of maximum absorbance for Acid Red 14 (520 nm), for Brilliant Green (623 nm) and 166 
for Reac tive Blue 19 (595 nm) was determined experimentally by using a spectrophotometer. 167 
Samples taken from reactors were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatant. 168 
The absorbance of the supernatant at individual maximum wavelength of dye absor bance  was used 169 6 
 to quantify Acid Red 14, Brilliant Green and Reactive  Blue 19, respectively. The decolourization (%) 170 
of dye  was calculated as the formula: decolourization (%) = [(Ai− A e)/Ai] × 100, where Ai is the initial 171 
absorbance of the dye in the influe nt and A e is the absorbance of the dye in the effluent.   172 
 173 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   174 
3.1 Decolourisation of azo, anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes during long- term operation by  175 
inoculating acetate -cultivated granules  176 
Figure 1 shows the decolourization of Acid Red 14  (AR14)  in R1, Brilliant Green  (BG)  in R2, and 177 
Reactive Blue 19  (RB19) in R3, respectively. Although azo concentration of  20-50 mg/L has been 178 
widely reported in the s tudies with aerobic granules (Muda et al., 2011; Kolekar et al., 2012; 179 
Lourenço et al., 2015) , step -wise increase in dye concentration was  adop ted in this study because of 180 
the observation of granule disintegration in R3 with the presence of anthraquinone dye in the first 181 
start -up trial. The step -wise increase in dye concentration in all three reactors does not only allow 182 
sufficient time for sludg e acclimatiz ed to enrich relevant species in acetate -cultivated granules for 183 
dye decolorization, but also ensure the same operation strategy used in three reactors fed with 184 
three different classes of dyes for a fair comparison.  185 
 186 
In the first ten  days, 10- 20mg/L of dye concentrations in the influent resulted in high residual dye 187 
concentrations in the effluent , especially in R1 and R3. Meanwhile, the partial disintegration of 188 
aerobic granules in R3 was observed.  In this case, dye addition was stopped and re actors were 189 
continued to operate with synthetic wastewater. On day 25, sludge in R3 was discarded, and aerobic 190 
granular sludge in reactors R1 and R2 was discharged and mixed to re -inoculate three reactor s 191 
evenly with a biomass concentration of 2.3 g/L in e ach reactor for re -startup of the three reactors 192 
aiming for  dye decolorization.  The dye addition started from 5 mg/L  in the second trial. It can be 193 
seen from Figure 1 that during the long- term operation period with a step -wise  increase in dye 194 
concentration to 85 mg/L, decolourization of AR14 was maintained at around 90%. BG has the best 195 
performance with almost 100% decolourization rate during long -term operation period with the dye 196 
concentration increased to 85 mg/L. According to the trends in Figure 1, it is expected that R1 and 197 
R2 can deal with higher dye concentrations with satisfactory decolourisation performance. R3 with 198 
RB19, however, experienced poorer decolourization compared with R1 and R3 with dye 199 
decolourisation rate ranging from 50 to 80%. Regarding granule stability, partial granule 200 
disintegration was observed when RB 19 was increased from 5 to 10  mg/L and the sludge became a 201 
mixture of suspended sludge and small granules .  Due to the relatively lower decolourization  rate, 202 7 
 the dye concentration in R3 was just increased to 40 mg/L after 110 days and maintained at this 203 
value until the end of the experiment.  204 
 205 
The results in this study suggest that acetate- cultivated granules can be acclimatized for the 206 
decolourization of the three most representative textile dyes, i.e. , azo, anthraquinone and 207 
triphenylmethane dyes.  A similar study was reported to successfully acclimatize acetate -cultivated 208 
granules for degradation of phenol (Tay et al., 2005a)  or chlorophenol (Carucci et al., 2009)   and for 209 
partial nitrification (Wang et al., 2016) . Specific species could be enriched in granules for the 210 
degradation of a specific type of pollutants. The conversion  of acetate -cultivated granules for dye 211 
decolourization  has a practical implication  because  this means in the future it is feasible to take 212 
aerobic granular sludge treating municipal wastewater to start up new reactors for industrial 213 
wastewater treatment with toxic or recalcitrant compounds to shorten reactor start -up time.  214 
 215 
Since anaerobic/aerobic operation mode was adopted in all three SBR reactors, the dye 216 
decolourisation  efficiency  during anaerobic and aerobic phases was  analysed as well and the results 217 
were shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that the vast majority of decol ourization occurred during the 218 
anaerobic phase for AR  14 and B G while circa 10 to 25% of decolourization of RB 19 was carried out 219 
in the aerobic phase and around 50% in anaerobic phase  after 50 days . From days 25 to 50, both 220 
anaerobic and aerobic phases co ntributed to dye decolourization because anaerobic phase alone 221 
was not sufficient to completely decolour dye s in all three reactors  at the initial acclimatization 222 
period . For example, on day 30, it was found that the total BG removal rate was above 85 % with the 223 
aerobic phase contributing more than the anaerobic phase. From day 30 to 40, dye removed colo ur 224 
in the aerobic phase quickly reduced to almost zero while with  almost 100% of BG was 225 
removed colour removed  in the anaerobic phase. Przystaś et al. (2012)  also reported either 226 
anaerobic or aerobic condition for triphenylmethane BG removal. They isolated one bacterial strain 227 
s45 ( Burkholderia cepacia) for 50 mg/L BG removal and found this bacterium achieved 100% GB 228 
removal efficiency in either aerobic condition or static (anaerobic) condition although GB removal 229 
rate was higher in aerobic than anaerobic condition. In addition, microorganisms which can remove 230 
triphenylmethane dye have been isolated in anaerobic (Wu et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2015)   or 231 
aerobic (Sani and Banerjee, 1999; Ogugbue and Sawidis, 2011)  condition .  That triphenylmethane 232 
dye GB can be re moved in either anaerobic or aerobic phase effectively by aerobic granules in this 233 
study indicat es that specific species enriched in aerobic granules could be anaerobic or aerobic or 234 
facultative regarding dye decolorization.  A similar phenomenon was observ ed in R1 and R3 too. 235 
Although anaerobic azo dye decolourization was extensively reported (Pandey et al., 2007) ,  a few 236 8 
 micr oorganisms that can decolorize azo dye in aerobic condition w ere still found (Stolz, 2001; Kodam 237 
et al., 2005) . Similar to azo dye, b acterial species that  can remove anthraquinone dyes in aerobic 238 
(Gurav et al., 2011)  or anaerobic  (Holkar et al., 2014)  condition were isolated as well.  For example, 239 
the decolourization rate of anthraquinone Acid Blue 25 (100 μmol/L) by Bacillus cereus DC11  is more 240 
than 55% under anaerobic conditions but below 5% under aerobic conditions (Deng et al., 2008)  241 
whilst G. geotrichum  achieved 45% of anthraquinone dye Vat Red 10 in aerobic condition (Gurav et 242 
al., 2011) .  243 
 244 
In general , however, dye decolourization efficiency in anaerobic condition especially for azo dye is 245 
much higher than in aerobic condition (Mishra and Maiti, 2018) . Decolourization of dyes in either 246 
anaerobic or aerobic conditions by different species allows aerobic granular sludge reactor with 247 
alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions to enrich sp ecific species favourable to either 248 
anaerobic or aerobic condition. This implies that anaerobic and aerobic phases do not need to be 249 
precisely controlled but still can maintain good dye decolourization efficiency. Furthermore, even 250 
with a mixture of three main classes of textile dyes such as azo, anthraquinone and 251 
triphenylmethane dyes, the same alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions  or the same lengths 252 
of anaerobic and aerobic phases  could be used for good dye removal performance. For dye 253 
degradation , an aerobic phase  is essential because it is believed to allow mineraliz ation of metabolic 254 
intermediates such as aromatic amines from decolourization of dyes to detoxify dyes to a maximum 255 
extent (Pandey et al., 2007) . 256 
 257 
Inoculated granules to three reactors were from aerobic conditions. After the cycle operation was 258 
changed from only aerobic phase to alternating 3 -h anaerobic and 3 -h aerobic phases, granules in R1 259 
and R2 during the 200 -day operation period always showed excellent stability, indicating the 260 
robustness and resilience of aerobic granules to varying conditi ons. This is favourable to practical 261 
application as granules cultivated from different conditions could be inoculated to start up new 262 
reactors.  263 
3.2 Effects of dyes on physical characteristics of microbial granules  264 
Figure 3 showed the physical morphologie s of granules from the three reactors on operation day 265 
200. It can be seen that the sludges in R1 fed with R A14 and R2 with B G were mixtures of 266 
small/young and large/mature granules . No obvious suspended sludge  was observed .  Granules in 267 
these two reactors  maintain ed remarkably  intact and compact structures. Because of dye 268 
adsorption, granules displayed corresponding dye colour. However, g ranules in R3 is a mixture of 269 9 
 small granules and suspended sludge, which was observed particularly when RB19 concentrati on 270 
increased from 5 to 10 mg/L. Since only 2 -minute settling time was used in the reactors, the 271 
disintegration of inoculated granules in R3 led to the significant  wash -out of sludge.  272 
Meanwhile, the growth of fast -settling suspended sludge was observed whi ch was mixed with small 273 
granules as shown in Figure 3. This indicates that the effects of dye s on granule structure stability 274 
depend on dye type. Azo and triphenylmethane dyes did not show any negative impact on the 275 
structure of  acetate- cultivated granule , but anthraquinone dye was very unfavourable to granule 276 
stability  in this study . Starting up reactors twice validated the adverse  effects of anthraquinone dye 277 
RB19 on granule stability. In addition, the step -wise increase in azo and triphenylmethane dye 278 
concentration in this study is conducive to granule stability because it was reported that the increase 279 
in azo dye from 50 directly to 100mg/l led to granule disintegration (Sadri Moghaddam and Alavi 280 
Moghaddam, 2016) . The granule size reduction was observed in the long- term operation of aerobic 281 
granular sludge reactors by Muda et al. (2011)  for azo dye decolourization when adjusting HRT. 282 
When multiple factors such as HRT , cycle time and OLR  were changed simultaneously  in the study by 283 
Muda et al. (2011) , it is not easy to determine if the decrease in aerobic granule size was due to the 284 
changes to operat ing conditions or from  the dye used in the study. In this study, we kept all other 285 
operating conditions constant . It is thus confident to say that granules can maintain structure 286 
stability after exposure to azo and triphenylmethane dyes in a step -wise increased manner. The 287 
presence of azo and triphenylmethane dyes do not affect biomass accumulation , which reached  288 
until 8 -12 g/L (Figure 4) over time just as it accumulated in reactors fed with  wastewater but no dyes 289 
(Liu et al., 2011) . High biomass retention makes the granular sludge more robust and resilient to 290 
decolorize dyes.   291 
Figure 4  shows that SVI 5 in all three reactors ranged  from 15 to 60 mL/g, a typical volume index 292 
range of granular sludge. Nevertheless, from the sludge morphology  shown in Figure 3 , it can be 293 
known that low SVI 5 does not necessarily represent a granule dominant sludge. This was in 294 
agreement with the report by  Liu et al. (2011) , in which a sludge volume percentage  of less than 200  295 
µm was proposed to indicate if sludge is dominated by granule s. Furthermore, a low and similar SVI 5 296 
did not retain biomass in R3 as in R1 and R2 because biomass retention  is also dependent on settling 297 
time applied  to reactors .  In this study, only 2 -minute settling time was adopted, which resulted in 298 
the wash -out of suspended sludge and small granules with low settling velocities (Toh et al., 2003) . 299 
Thus, maintaining a granule structure is crucial to retain  sufficient  biomass in reactors, which is 300 
beneficial to sludge to withstand high toxic compound load  by reducing the toxic compound load to 301 
per unit of micr oorganisms . It can be found from Figure 4, that on day 200, dye to microorganism 302 
ratio (D/M), i.e. , the toxic compound load to per unit of microorganisms per day, was 13.5 -16.4 303 10 
 times higher in R3 with RB 19 than R1 and R2 although dye concentration in infl uent fed to R3 was 304 
only around half of that to R1 and R2. The higher D/M ratio might be one of the reasons that R3 was 305 
not able to re -develop granule dominant sludge during long- term operation period  even the 306 
favourable operational conditions to granulatio n (Qin et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2007)  was adopted. 307 
From the second start- up of reactors with 5 mg/L dye concentration on day 25 to day 200, D/M in R1 308 
and R2 increased 3.3 and 4.0 times, respectively, to deal with more dyes while it rose by 53 times in 309 
R3. The significant increase in D/M implies the importance of biomass retention in granular sludge 310 
reactors .  Higher MLVSS is preferred because it can reduce D/M, and thus allow a higher influent dye 311 
concentration for a higher dye colorization efficiency. However, biomass concentration informatio n 312 
was missing in most related  studies, leading to less possibility to compare results and little general 313 
conclusion about the capability of granules for dye decolourization. Muda et al. (2011)  reported 314 
MLVSS data although they attributed higher color remov al percentage in phase IV to both factors 315 
i.e., OLR and MLVSS . But when we used their reported data to calculate , it is found that the increase 316 
in the colour removal percentage from 67 % in phase I to 83% in phase IV with the same ratio of 317 
anaerobic to aero bic phase in all 4 phases was accompanied with D/M reduced  from 0.00313 to 318 
0.00096/day. This indicates that D/M could be used to explain or predict dye color removal 319 
efficiency particularly  when multiple operational parameters such as cycle time, OLR and b iomass 320 
concentration were changed at the same time. However,  it needs to be pointed out that besides 321 
D/M, lengths of anaerobic and aerobic phases  (Muda et al., 2011)  and the availability of sufficient 322 
external carbon sources  (Ong et al., 2005)  could also affect dye color removal efficiency.   323 
3.3 Decolourisation of dyes in sequencing batch cycles with/without acetate addition   324 
Given the fact that 100% of dye decolourization efficiency was always achieved in R2 fed with BG , 325 
cycle studies on days 199 and 200 with/without acetate were focused on R1 with AR14 and R3  with 326 
RB19 .  It can be seen from Figure 5  that at the same dye concentration, the presence of acetate 327 
increased AR 14 removal rate in the anaerobic phase significantly. As shown in Figure 6 , AR14 328 
removal rate with the acetate was 2 3.1 mg/L∙h while it reduced by 46% , i.e., 12.6 mg/L∙h with the 329 
dye only  (Figure 6) . Considering biomass concentrations in two individual cycles were  slightly 330 
different, the specific dye removal rate s based on biomass were calculated. It was found that 331 
without readily biodegra dable carbon source s such as acetate , the specific dye removal rate  was 332 
reduced by 38%  from 1. 7 to 1.1 mg/g MLVSS∙ L∙h). These data suggest that co -substrate can increase 333 
the removal rate of AR 14. The enhancement of azo dye decolourization efficiency by co -substrate 334 
has been well established (Zhang et al., 2019) , but co-substrate can also increase the azo dye 335 
decolourization rate . It is possible that  acetate enhanced the reductive cleavage of azo dye apart 336 
from maintaining bacterial growth and activity.   337 11 
  338 
In R3 fed with RB19, however, the effects of acetate in wastewater on dye removal rate was not as 339 
obvious as that on AR14. The dye removal rate without acetate seems even higher than that with 340 
acetate. But the biomass concentrations in two cycles different. Therefore, the dye removal rate is 341 
not able to show the activity of biomass for dye decolorization. It can be seen from Figure 6 that t he 342 
specific dye removal rate was still low er when no acetated was added into wastewater. It reduced by 343 
15 % from 8.4 to 7.1 mg/g MLVSS∙ L∙h, showing the benefit of external carbon source to RB19 344 
decolourization as well. E xternal carbon and nitrogen sources are usually added for anthraquinone 345 
dye degradation. Some believed that external carbon sources were to promote bacterial growth and 346 
activity and to maintain the diversity of the microbial community (Li et al., 2019)  while others 347 
showed that anthraquinone dye removal was significantly enhanced by the  addition of carbon 348 
sources through the co -metabolic process (Xu et al., 2006; Giwa et al., 2012) . This difference might 349 
be primarily from the difference of species used or enriched for anthraquinone degradation with 350 
different metabolic pathways. The common  carbon sources used in the laboratory studies are 351 
glucose, sucrose, D -maltose, L -rhamnose  (Kurade et al., 2016) . The specific anthraquinone removal 352 
rate is only 15 % higher with the presence of acetate, suggesting that acetate might be more  used for 353 
bacterial growth or activity maintenance than co -metabolism with dye. Higher specific azo and 354 
anthraquinone dye removal rates with the presence of acetate indicate the necessity of other 355 
carbon sources for dye decolorization.  356 
 357 
In the literature, dye removal rate mg/L ∙h was widely used for the comp arison of dye removal 358 
performance by different biomass or bacteria (Franca et al., 2020) . In this study, the removal rate of 359 
anthraquinone dye RB19 was around 2.6 - 3.4 mg/L∙ h while 0.29 -2.5 mg/L∙ h decolourization rates in 360 
the literature by using fungal isolates (Yemendzhiev et al. , 2009; Attéké et al., 2013; Mounguengui et 361 
al., 2014)  or consortium of Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris  (Parmar and Shukla, 2015)  were 362 
reported. Chaudhari et al. (2017)  reported 0.67 -6.32 mg/L∙ h of anthraquinone dye RB4 at static 363 
condition s by using aerobic granules . Thus, anthraquinone dye removal rate by using aerobic 364 
granules in Chaudhari’s and this study appears  higher than suspended biomass. However, the dye 365 
removal rate is affected dramatically by biomass concentration. Thus, the specific dye removal rate 366 
is a fairer parameter for the comparison  of biomass activity for dye removal whil e the dye removal 367 
rate is better for the comparison of reactor performance . There was, however, widely lacking 368 
biomass concentration data in the literature. For example, It is hard  to know if higher dye 369 
decolorizaiton rate such as 6.32 mg/L ∙h in Chaudhari’s study than 3.4 mg/L ∙h in our study was due to  370 
higher biomass concentration in their batch tests because in our study only 0.3 -0.5 mg/L biomass 371 12 
 was retained in R3 due to granule d isintegration during the long -term operation  period . In addition, 372 
it was found that Chaudhari e t al. (2017)  used granules with a size of 7 -9mm for the dye test,  373 
significantly larger than an average size of aerobic granules such as 1 -2mm that could be achieved 374 
and stabilised in most studies on aerobic granules. Meanwhile, only batch tests for 16 c ycles with 375 
each cycle of 48 hours were carried out without a description of granule morphology, leading to little 376 
information on effects of the anthraquinone dye on granule stability during long -term operation. In 377 
this study, however, the disintegration and instability of granules were observed after being exposed 378 
to anthraquinone dye RB19 even under the condition even with a step -wise increase in dye 379 
concentration aiming to minimize toxic anthraquinone day shock on granules.   380 
The remo val rate of AR14 was almost 4 times of that of RB19  while  the specific anthraquinone 381 
decolourization rate such as 7 -8 mg/g MLVSS ∙L∙h was 5-6.5 folds of that of azo dye, suggest ing a 382 
much higher specific biomass activity in R3 for RB19 decolourization and the promising potential of 383 
sludge acclimatized for anthraquinone dye removal.  However, t he instability of granule structure 384 
caused great concern for the application of aerobic granules to anthraquinone dye s because high 385 
dye removal rate was not able to be achieve d at low biomass concentration  due to granule 386 
disintegration and over- growth of suspended sludge .  Furthermore , the reactor with low biomass 387 
concentration is fragile when  facing toxic compound shock and fluctuation of operation conditions.  388 
One of t he most significant advantages of granular sludge to treat dye containing wastewater is the 389 
high biomass retention in reactors. In addition, large granule size with mass transfer resistance 390 
inside can make granules more resilient to unfavourable conditions  especially with toxic compounds 391 
(Tay et al., 2005b) . When  granule stability was negatively affected by anthraquinone dye such as in 392 
R3, the dye removal rate  was significantly lower.  Therefore, the bottleneck to use aerobic granule 393 
for anthraquinone dye or a mixture of dyes containing anthraquinone is how to improve granule 394 
stability and thus increase biomass retention in reactors for highly efficient dye colour  removal. The 395 
stability of granules should be future research focus for anthraquinone  dye removal.    396 
4. CONCLUSIONS   397 
This study investigated decolourization of azo, anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes by 398 
inoculating acetate -cultivated aerobic granules.  Based on the research work done in this study, the 399 
main conclusions are drawn  as: i) Change of cycle operation of a erobic granular sludge reactors from 400 
pure aerobic phase to alternating anaerobic and aerobic phases in one cycle do not affect granule 401 
stability and long -term operation. In addition, a erobic granular sludge cultivated with acetate can be 402 
acclimatized to re mov ing three types of dyes, i.e. azo, anthraquinone and tri phenylmethane  dyes .  403 
These allow new reactor start -up for dye decolourization by inoculating mature granules from 404 13 
 different processes feasible, providing flexible and simple reactor start -up strate gies for textile 405 
wastewater treatment ;  ii) Both azo and triphenylmethane dyes do not have any negative impact on 406 
granule structure stability and biomass retention during the long- term operation period. 100% and 407 
90% removal efficiency could be achieved for triphenylmethane dye GB and azo dye AR14 , 408 
respectively .  However, the addition of anthraquinone dye RB19  to influent resulted in  the 409 
disintegration of granules,  over -growth of suspended sludge,  poor biomass retention and low 410 
biomass concentration in the reactor, leading to  high dye -to-microorganism ratio and low dye 411 
decolourization efficiency  and rate . Granules are very promising to treat azo and triphenylmethane 412 
dyes for long -term stability but not anthraquinone.  413 
For the  first time , this work studied long- term stability of granules when treating dye -containing 414 
wastewater with azo,  anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes, and compared decolourization 415 
performance of three classes of dyes in the same reactor configuration an d operati ng conditions. 416 
The study identified different effects of dyes with different chemical structures on long -term granule  417 
stability. The findings on specific dye decolourization rate and dye -to-microorganism ratio of 418 
granular sludge for three differen t classes of dyes provide a foundation for further investigation to 419 
improve granule stability when treating textile wastewater with multiple classes of dyes.   420
