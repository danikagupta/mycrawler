Objective  To investigate the influence of salin ity variations on the performance of  activated sludge systems, treating 
domestic wastewater.  Methods  The completely mixed reactor  was used and operated in a batch-wise mode. The activated 
sludge taken from the Gaobeidian Wastewat er Treatment Plant was used as a seed ing sludge. Total organic carbon (TOC), 
oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and suspended solids (SS) were used as  parameters to characterize the performance of the treatment 
systems. TOC was measured using a TOC-analyzer (TOC-5000, Japan). The OUR value was measured with a dissolved oxygen 
meter (YSI model-58). SS wa s measured gravimetrically.   Results  The TOC removal efficiency and the OUR value of 
activated sludge were not deteriorated when  the NaCl shock concentration was less than 0.5 g/L. However, when the NaCl 
shock concentrations were up to 10g/L and 20 g/L, the OUR  of activated sludge was reduced by 35% and TOC removal 
efficiency was dropped by 30%, compared with the control experiment without NaCl shock loading.  Conclusion   The effect 
of NaCl shock loading on the activated sl udge wastewater treatment system is dependa nt upon the NaCl concentrations and the 
degree of influence can be inferred thr ough the change of substrate utilization ra te at different shock NaCl loadings.

INTRODUCTION 
Sodium chloride (NaCl) and other salts may reach 
wastewater by several means. Seawater has been used as 
an alternative water source for toilet flushing in some 
coastal cities, resulting in a high salt content in the 
sewage. Also in coastal areas, infiltration of saline water 
into sewers is associated with subsurface water rise and 
contributes a high concentration of chloride to 
wastewater. In addition, certain industrial wastewater 
contains high inorganic salts because of specific 
technologies, such as cheese, pickling, canning and dye 
manufacturing. Saline sewage is also generated and has 
to be treated on board marine vessels or on offshore 
installations[1-3]. The activated sludge process is usually 
used to treat wastewater for its low cost, so it is thought that the shock salt loading may influence the process 
when saline wastewater ente rs wastewater treatment 
systems. 
In the wastewater treatment field, there are 
conflicting reports on the influence of NaCl on the performance of biological treatment processes. It was 
found that addition of NaCl increased the respiration 
rate of microorganisms up to a specific salt concent- ration, thereafter a decrease was observed
[4-7]. Some 
investigators reported the adverse effects of high NaCl concentrations or shocks of NaCl on organic 
removal efficiency and sludge se ttleability
[8-11]. Other 
researchers claimed that addition of NaCl to biological treatment systems did not upset the organic 
removal efficiency, on the other hand, it resulted in a 
good flocculation of the biomass
[12-14]. 
It seems that the level of NaCl content used and 
acclimation of the biomass to NaCl content are 
important factors to explain the observations above. In 
the light of earlier studies, this study was to determine 
the effects of shock NaCl loading on the activated 
sludge process treating domestic sewage. Variation of 
TOC removal efficiency and the OUR of activated 
sludge with NaCl shock loadings were determined.

operated in batch-wise. Two point five L domestic 
wastewater was added in eac h reactor and inoculated 
with 0.5 L activated sludge (MLSS=6 g/L). Activated sludge was taken from the Gaobeidian Wastewater 
Treatment Plant, Beijing, treating municipal wastew- 
ater. Domestic wastewater was taken from the campus 
of Tsinghua University. One reactor was used as the 
tested reactor and the other was taken as the control 
reactor so as to provide the baseline of the study. 
Experimental Design 
All experiments were conducted in batch-wise at 
room temperature (20 ℃±5℃). After 2.5 L domestic 
wastewater and 0.5 L activ ated sludge with 6 g/L 
MLSS were added into the two reactors, aeration started to acclimate activ ated sludge. During the 
acclimation period, 2.5 L
 supernatant was withdrawn 
and 2.5 L fresh domestic wastewater was refilled in 
the two reactors every 23 h ours for one month. After 
acclimation, 2.5 L supernatant was withdrawn and 2.5 
L fresh domestic wastewater was refilled in the two 
reactors. After operation for one hour, various 
amounts of NaCl needed to maintain the shock 
concentration was added into the tested reactor. The 
examined shock loadings of NaCl were 0.1 g/L, 0.5 
g/L, 2 g/L, 5 g/L, 10 g/L, and 20 g/L. At different 
intervals, samples were taken and TOC, OUR and SS 
of the control and tested systems were determined. 
The analytical method us ed for SS was outlined 
in Standard Methods[15]. The TOC was determined 
using a TOC-analyzer (TOC-5000, Japan). The OUR value was measured with the YSI model-58 dissolved 
oxygen meter. 
RESULTS  
Effect of Shock NaCl Loading on TOC Removal 
Efficiency 
The effect of shock NaCl loadings on activated 
sludge process was evaluated based on TOC removal 
efficiency and the OUR of  activated sludge. TOC 
removal efficiency was defined as: 
TOC removal efficiency ( η)=C t/C0    (1) 
Where: C t is TOC in wastewater at time t, mg/L. 
In this study, the zero point of time was defined as 1 
hour before the addition of NaCl.  
C0 is TOC in wastewater 1 hour before the 
addition of shock NaCl loading, mg/L.  
TOC 1- is TOC in wastewater just before the 
addition of NaCl and TOC 1+ is TOC in wastewater 
just after the addition of NaCl. 
The variation of TOC removal efficiency with 
NaCl concentrations is depicted in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1, it was found that NaCl shock loading had no obvious influence on TOC removal efficiency of the activated 
sludge system when the shock NaCl concentrations 
were 0.1 g/L and 0.5 g/L. The TOC removal efficiency 
was near to that of the control experiment. While the 
shock loading was 2 g/L, TOC removal efficiency 
decreased 7% at t=10 hour s, compared with the 
control reactor.

shock loadings of NaCl. 
Effect of Shock NaCl Loading on OUR 
Oxygen uptake rate (OUR) is an important 
parameter to express the microbial activity of 
activated sludge in the wast ewater treatment process. 
Actually, more attention was paid to the change of OUR of activated sludge when the addition of shock 
NaCl loading in this study. 
A parameter defined as OUR retention was 
utilized to express the change of activity of activated 
sludge, shown in Equation (2). 
OUR retention=OUR t/OUR 1-       ( 2 )  
Where: OUR t is value of OUR of activated 
sludge at time t; 
OUR 1- is value of OUR of activated sludge just 
before the addition of NaCl; 
OUR 1+ is value of OUR of activated sludge just 
after the addition of NaCl. 
The influence of NaCl concentrations on OUR 
value is shown in Fig. 2. The experimental results indicated that low shock concentrations of NaCl (0.1 
g/L and 0.5 g/L) had no significant effect on OUR of 
the activated sludge, as the impact on TOC removal 
efficiency. OUR retention of activated sludge was 
near to that of the control experiment. 
Macro-kinetic Analysis 
To examine the effect of shock NaCl loading on 
the activated sludge system, macro kinetic analysis is a useful method. The substrate utilization rate was 
subjected to the substrate concentration and the amount 
of active biomass, etc. In this study, in order to elucidate EFFECT OF SALINITY ON ACTIV ATED SLUDGE 7

sludge at different shock loading of NaCl. 
the impact of shock NaCl loading on activated sludge 
process, a pseudo first-order model was employed to 
express the substrate utilization rate, shown in 
Equation (3). This method was based on the following 
assumption: in such a short time in this study, the 
amount of active biomass was constant and macro 
kinetics analysis was for th e comparison between the 
tested reactor and the control reactor.

where:-dS/d t is the substrate utilization rate, g/(L h) 
K is the substrate utilization rate constant, h-1
S is substrate concentration in the reactor 
(expressed as TOC), g/L 
Integrating equation (3) for the boundary 
conditions: t=1 to t=t and S=S 1 to S=S t, yields the 
following equation: 
lnS t – lnS 1 =  -  K ( t - 1 )          ( 4 )  
Equation (4) shows that there is a linear 
relationship between lnS t and t, and the K is the slope 
of this line. The straight-line plots of lnS versus  time 
were analyzed and the K at various NaCl shock conc- 
entrations is summarized in Table 1.

Note. * K0 is corresponding to substrate utilization rate in the 
control reactor and the value was determined to be 0.512 h-1. DISCUSSION 
Fig. 1 shows that TOC removal efficiency 
decreased sharply at a high shock loading of NaCl, it decreased by 30%, 45%, and 72%, respectively, 
when NaCl concentrations were 5 g/L, 10 g/L, and 20 g/L, compared with the c ontrol reactor. In addition, 
when the NaCl shock concentration was 20 g/L, it was different from the other cases. In comparison 
with TOC
1-, TOC 1+ was increased by 25%. The 
reason may be that high NaCl shock concentrations caused plasmolysis so that cellular constituents were 
released immediately into wastewater treatment 
systems. However, when t > 1 h, the TOC removal 
efficiency of this system increased gradually, the 
negative impact of shock NaCl loadings could be 
recovered partly. 
Fig. 2 reveals that the activated sludge process 
could function normally through adjusting its 
metabolism under these NaCl concentrations. At the 
moment of NaCl addition, OUR decreased rapidly, 
especially when the activated sludge was dosed with 
2 g/L and 5 g/L of NaCl. The OUR value was 
decreased by 20% and 22%, respectively. The activity of sludge was inhibited under such conditions 
and the respiration rate decreased. 
From Figs. 1 and 2, we can see that both the 
TOC removal efficiency and OUR retention were not 
affected obviously at the shock concentration of 2 g/L. 
The reason may be that th e microbial physiological 
frame was not destroyed, respiration and anabolism could perform normally, and the activated sludge 
could recover through acclimatization. The OUR 
value of the sludge dropped sharply at the point of 
adding NaCl when the NaCl concentrations were 5 
g/L, 10 g/L and 20 g/L, respectively. Fig. 2 
demonstrates that the OUR was decreased by 35% 
and 37% when the NaCl con centrations were 10 g/L 
and 20 g/L. 
Figs.1 and 2 show that the effect of shock NaCl 
loading on the activated sludge treatment system 
varied with the NaCl concentrations. The higher the 
NaCl concentration, the more the TOC removal 
efficiency decreased because a high NaCl concentration 
could destroy the normal osmotic pressure and cause 
the loss of biological activity.  
From Table 1, it is easy to infer the impact of 
shock NaCl loading on the activated sludge system 
treating domestic wastew ater. The sequence of 
impact is: NaCl=20 g/L > NaCl=10 g/L > NaCl=5 g/L > NaCl=2 g/L > NaCl=0.5 g/L > NaCl=0.1 g/L. 
That is to say, the higher the shock NaCl loading, the 
more the notable impact. When the NaCl shock 
loading was less than 2 g/L, the impact could be 
ignored, however when the NaCl shock concentration WANG ET AL. 8
was up to 20 g/L, the impact was so serious that some 
measures must be taken so as to avoid unrecoverable 
impairment.  
CONCLUSION 
Based on the experiment results obtained, the 
following conclusions can be reached: the effects of salt shock loading on activated sludge vary with the 
shock concentrations of NaCl. TOC removal 
efficiency and the OUR of  activated sludge are not 
deteriorated when the shock NaCl loading is less than 
0.5 g/L, however, when the NaCl shock concentration 
is greater than 5 g/L, OUR of the activated sludge can 
be reduced by more than 35% and TOC removal efficiency decreased by mo re than 30%. The impact 
of shock NaCl loading on biological treatment 
systems can be investigated through the variations of 
substrate utilization rate at different shock NaCl 
loadings.
