Zincochromite nanoparticles (NPs) were precipitated on surfaces of the as-prepared
Al2O3micron-sized particles by a heterogeneous precipitation technique using urea
as a homogeneous precipitation agent. This procedure leads to decrease the pore
diameter and increase the pore volume and speci ﬁc surface area ( as), realizing the
potential access to ZnCr 2O4catalytic sites. Although the obtained band gap energy
(Eg)o fA l 2O3-ZnCr 2O4composite is about 2.3 eV (more than ZnCr 2O4), the absor-
bance is enhanced about 1.5 orders of magnitude. These characteristics make it an
effective photocatalyst of inorganic dyes from an aqueous media. Dye removal
performance of the nanocomposite powder is higher than that of pure ZnCr 2O4,
which is attributed to an increase in the photocatalytic sites and the absorbance
intensity. It was believed that the surface area created from Al 2O3support realized
the potential access to ZnCr 2O4catalytic sites. To con ﬁrm these assertions, X-ray
diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffuse re ﬂectance
spectroscopy (DRS), and N 2adsorption-desorption analysis were applied.

1|INTRODUCTION
The spinel compounds are any materials composed of diva-
lent and trivalent ions with general formulation of AB 2X4,
where A, B, and X are divalent cation, trivalent cation and
anion, respectively.1The oxide spinels are widely known
andﬁnd some applications such as the following:
Magnesium aluminates (MgAl 2O4) is used for optically
transparent ceramic usages, neutron radiation resistanceapplications, humidity sensors, refractories, catalyst, and
catalyst supports.
2
Gahnite (ZnAl 2O4) as a catalyst is applied to degrade
the gaseous toluene,3reform the ethanol steam,4and
complete treatment of NO x.5
Magnetite (Fe 3O4) is employed for biomedical applica-
tions,6,7water treatments8,9and magnetic adsorbent.10Zincochromite (ZnCr 2O4) is one of the chromium spi-
nels with the humidity sensing performance,11photocat-
alytic behavior,12and magnetic properties.13,14
Various methods have been applied to synthesize
ZnCr 2O4and its composites, including mechanical mixing
and heat treatment of ZnO-Cr 2O3powder mixtures,15direct
calcinations of ZnO-Cr 2O3powder mixture,16thermal
decomposition of Zn-Cr gel achieved from sol gel tech-
nique,17thin ﬁlm fabrication by RF sputtering system,18
etc. Since the photocatalytic and catalytic behaviors of the
synthesized ZnCr 2O4are important factors determining its
applications, the researchers focus on the special methods
enhancing these properties by decreasing the particle size
and/or increasing the as.19-21It is very important to choose
the best preparation method and materials to obtain a pureReceived: 20 October 2016|Accepted: 24 October 2016

studies is by Peng et al. They have been used a simple
hydrothermal route to synthesize ZnCr 2O4NPs with aver-
age particle size of 5 nm and direct band gap about
3.46 eV.12Gingasu et al. have been synthesized ZnCr 2O4
NPs using precursor method via thermal decomposition of tar-tarate compound and gluconate compound. The average crys-
tallite size and a
sare approximately 60 nm and 77 m2/g.22
Mousavi et al. have been recently reported a facile
co-precipitation method to achieve ZnCr 2O4NPs from
Zn(NO 3)2/C16H2O and CrCl 3/C16H2O. The average particle
size was measured as ~70 nm with remarkable activity
for dye removing from waste water.23As described else-
where,24ZnCr 2O4NPs (with the average particle size of
13 nm) have been prepared by a simple and cheap
homogeneous precipitation method using urea hydrolysis
followed by heat treatment at 500 °C. The ashas been
reported to be about 47 m2/g. Although some improve-
ments have been obtained by the mentioned methods,
this research is focused on increasing the asby applying
Al2O3as the crystallization sites.
The aim of this research is to enhance the procedure
used in the previous work24by applying Al-containing pre-
cursor to act as the precipitation site. It is expected that the
existence of Al 2O3nuclei will diminish the agglomeration
of the as-synthesized NPs and exhibit a remarkable
improvement over the as.
2|EXPERIMENTAL
2.1 |Raw chemicals and preparation method
The ZnCr 2O4NPs were synthesized as described else-
where,24using zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH 3COO) 2/C12H2O
(Merck, Hohenbrunn, Germany)] as a zinc source, chromium
nitrate [Cr(NO 3)2/C19H2O (Merck)] as a chromium source, and
urea powder [NH 2CONH 2(Merck)] as a hydrolyzing agent.
To prepare Al 2O3-ZnCr 2O4nanocomposite, a simple method
has been applied which was previously reported to synthe-
size Al 2O3-ZnO nanocomposite. Aluminum hydroxide pow-
der [Al(OH) 3(Bayerite-type, Ardakan Industrial Ceramics
Co., Ardakan, Iran)] was used as an Al-containing precursor
to provide Al 2O3seeds in the precipitation media.25,26
At the ﬁrst step, zinc acetate dehydrate and chromium
nitrate were mixed with the molar ratio of 1:2 to obtain a
0.3 mol/L solution, and then a large amount of urea was
added to the solution under string to adjust the molar ratio ofurea: [Zn
2++Cr3+] to 6:1. In order to provide Al ions, an ade-
quate amount of aluminum hydroxide solution [Al(OH) 3
(3lm, Bayerite-type, Ardakan Industrial Ceramics Co.,
Iran)] was added into the suspension during stirring. The
solution was continuously stirred at 25 °C for 2 h, sonicated
for 20 min and then re ﬂuxed in an oil bath at 90 °C for 24 h.The pH change is an index of urea hydrolysis. The pH
initial value, ie, before the addition of urea, was about 6. It
did not increase signi ﬁcantly by adding urea due to its ther-
mal stability. The re ﬂux process provides suf ﬁcient energy
for urea decomposition and gradual increase in pH, reach-
ing necessary value for metal hydroxides precipitation. The
progression of precipitation leads to decrease in metal pre-
cursor and consequently increase in pH. The pH value of
the experimented solution reached to ~9 at the end of the
reﬂux period.27,28
This procedure provides the conditions under which
urea hydrolysis occurs and consequently the metal ions-containing compounds precipitate.
29It is expected that the
mentioned method would lead to form Zn2+/Cr3+/Al3+-
containing precipitate, based on the heterogeneous precipi-
tation theory.30
After ﬁltering and washing with distilled water, the
obtained precipitate was dried at 160 °C overnight, and then
calcined at 500 °C for 3 h. (The calcinations temperature
was chosen based on the simultaneous thermal analysis
(STA) results representing in Section 3.)
For a comparative purpose, pure ZnCr 2O4and Al 2O3
were also prepared. High-purity Al 2O3powder and also
ZnCr 2O4powder were prepared by co-precipitation method
through urea hydrolysis through the same procedure, as
mentioned for ZnCr 2O4-Al2O3.
2.2 |Characterization
The phase identi ﬁcation was carried out by powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD, Philips, Eindhoven, Netherland). The
thermal behaviors of the as-prepared samples were perusedwith differential thermal and thermo-gravimetric analysis
(DTA and TG), using a thermal analyzer (METTLER
TGA/SDTA 851E, Mettler-Toledo Ltd., Leicester, UK) at a
heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to
1000 °C. The morphology and particle size of the product
were studied by ﬁeld-emission scanning electron micro-
scopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4160, Tokyo, Japan), and also
chemical microanalyses of the samples were identi ﬁed by
energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS-MAP). The diffuse
reﬂectance spectra (DRS) were collected by a spectropho-
tometer (V-670, Jasco, Easton, PA). The Tauc method wasapplied to determine the optical band gap energy ( E
g) via
plotting ( ahυ)2against h υ, where ais the absorption coef ﬁ-
cient and h υis the photon energy and then the linear part
of the curve extrapolated to ( ahυ)2=0.31
To specify the speci ﬁc surface area and pore character-
istics, the N 2adsorption-desorption analysis was performed
at 77 K by a surface area analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP-
2010, Norcross, GA), and the required results were
obtained by applying the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET),Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH), and Dollimore-Heal (DH)2|TAJIZADEGAN ET AL .methods. The volume of N 2adsorbed at the completion of
a monolayer at IUPAC established standard temperature
and pressure ( Vm), energy constant in the ﬁrst layer ( C),
mean pore diameter , total speci ﬁc surface area ( as), and to-
tal pore volume (atp/p0=0.990) were calculated based on
the BET model. The pore volume ( Vp), pore distribution
peak ( rp peak ) and pore speci ﬁc surface area ( ap) were
determined using BJH and DH techniques.
The dye removal performance as an index of the photo-
catalytic activity was evaluated for the as-synthesized
ZnCr 2O4and Al 2O3-ZnCr 2O4samples by investigating the
decomposition behavior of methylene blue (MB) irradiatedwith 365 nm ultra-violet lamp (2 915 W, Philips). TiO
2-
P25 (AEROXIDE, Degussa, Evonik, Essen, Germany) as a
standard commercial photocatalyst was used for comparing
the results. For this purpose, an aqueous MB solution
(30 mg/L) was prepared and then 50 mg of each powder
(ZnCr 2O4,A l 2O3-ZnCr 2O4, and TiO 2-P25) was added to
the 50 mL of MB solution. The UV irradiation was per-
formed for 2 h at room temperature with the distance of
10 cm. Then, the solutions were centrifuged and NPs were
separated from the solution. The MB concentrations were
measured by a UV-visible spectrophotometer at 664 nm.
3|RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As described in a previous paper, ZnCr 2O4was success-
fully prepared by the homogeneous precipitation method24;therefore, its characteristics would be considered as a com-
parison index to evaluate the in ﬂuences of the Al 2O3parti-
cles on the phase component, optical properties, and thespeciﬁc surface area of the obtained compound.
Thermal analysis helps to determine the required heat
treatment schedule. Figure 1 shows the TGA and DTA
curves of the as-prepared Zn/Cr and Al/Zn/Cr containing
powders. As can be seen, the thermal behaviors of both
samples are similar and the temperature region in which
the unique exothermic reaction occurred is 300-500 °C. This
event accompanied with the mass loss can be associated
with a chemical conversion. However, commenting on thissubject needs more characterizations. What can be inferred
from this ﬁgure is the heat treatment schedule that was
chosen as 500 °C for 3 h. This condition can guarantee the
completion of the mentioned chemical reaction.
Figure 2(a-c) shows the XRD results of the calcined
samples; the Al containing powder, the Zn/Cr containing
powder and the Al/Zn/Cr containing sample. In the ﬁrst
pattern, a low crystalline powder containing a trace of c-
Al
2O3[JCPDF # 1-1308] has been observed. A mixture of
Al(OH) 3and urea was dried and calcined at 500 °C and a
semi-crystalline c-Al2O3powder was achieved. The low
intensity and wide peaks con ﬁrm that this calcination tem-
perature is not adequate for complete crystallization of
Al2O3. However, these particles could be synthesized via
this process. The second pattern is related to the Zn/Cr
containing powder. As it was explained elsewhere,
ZnCr 2O4NPs could be achieved via homogeneous

third pattern is related to the aim of this manuscript namely
the Al/Zn/Cr containing solution. It is clear that the XRDpattern of this sample is the sum of the previous two pat-
terns. All the intense peaks are corresponding to ZnCr
2O4
[JCPDF # 73-1962], whereas the basic shape of this patternis similar to that of the Al-containing sample. It means that
a ceramic/ceramic composite powder consisting of Al
2O3/
ZnCr 2O4has been synthesized.
The sequence of phase formation before and after the
calcination process has been evaluated utilizing XRD.
Figure 2(c,e) shows the results, illustrating that the dried
sample consists mainly of Al 2O3, whereas the phase
components change during calcination in which ZnCr 2O4
is synthesized. It can be concluded that the nuclei and/or
crystallites of Al 2O3could be synthesized during drying;
therefore, its related peaks are tiny and wide. In other
word, feature of the dried powder (Figure 2e) is similar
to the standard peaks of ZnCr 2O4[JCPDF # 73-1962]
(Figure 2d), as well as traces of Al 2O3characteristic
peaks (triangles at about 46 °and 67 °). The Al 2O3crys-
tallites could act as nucleation sites that could facilitate
the nucleation of ZnCr 2O4phase. Due to multiplicity of
sites where the ZnCr 2O4nuclei can be crystallized, the
heterogeneous precipitation can be accepted for this
preparation method. This claim would be explained in
the following paragraphs.
FESEM-EDS elemental mapping of the as-synthesized
Al2O3-ZnCr 2O4composite powder reveals the ZnCr 2O4
particles distribution over the Al 2O3support. As can beseen in Figure 3, Al and O have been distributed over the
map with higher concentration; mine while, Cr and Zn
have distributed uniformly with low concentrations. Theseresults consolidate the hypothesis that ZnCr
2O4NPs precip-
itate over Al 2O3particles, improving their characteristics.
Base on this analysis, the O, Al, Cr, and Zn atomic per-
centage (at. %) were estimated about 53, 20, 14, and 6,
respectively. Therefore, the mole ratio of ZnO:Cr 2O3:Al2O3
in the as-synthesized powder was calculated about 6:7:10.Similarly, the mole ratio of ZnCr
2O4/Al2O3was estimated
about 6.5/10 and the mole percentage of ZnCr 2O4in the
composite powder was achieved about 40%.
The morphology of the as-synthesized compound is the
main factor distinguishing its physical properties. Figure 4shows the FE-SEM images of the dried precipitate (Fig-
ure 4A,B) and the calcined powder (Figure 4C,D) of
Al
2O3- ZnCr 2O4. The porous structure of the ZnCr 2O4
powder is also provided in Figure 4E (This ﬁgure has been
originally published in the previous work24). There are
some micron particles in the dried precipitate powder (see
Figure 4A) which was originated from Al(OH) 3powder.
These particles are probably the mentioned sites for new
phase nucleation. Figure 4B shows the surface of this parti-cle with higher magni ﬁcation. As can be seen, precipitates
particles with less than 10 nm size and similar shapes were
formed. Although micron size particles retain after calcinat-
ing the powder (see Figure 4C), the morphology and size
of the nano-size particles on the surface of the micron-size
particles had been changed. The heat treatment led to the
removal of the inorganic part of the particles, by rising up

of NPs to agglomerate could lead to particles representing
irregular agglomeration with a wide range of size distribu-
tion. These two phenomena are the main reasons for differ-
ences between Figure 4B,D. However, the observation of
the as-synthesized NPs on the surface of the micron-size
particles is a remarkable result, regardless of the size andmorphology. Figure 4E shows the FESEM image of the
ZnCr 2O4particles without any seed as the nucleation site.24
This ﬁgure con ﬁrms that the microstructure of the ZnCr 2O4
NPs is a porous one and that the particles are joined to
each other, hence forming welded agglomerates. The differ-
ences between Figure 4D,E are ascribed to the existence
of Al-compound in the solution. For this reason,
FIGURE 3 Elemental distribution map of the as-synthesized powder. [Color ﬁgure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]TAJIZADEGAN ET AL . |5Al-containing particles act as the nucleation sites and
ZnCr 2O4NPs could crystallize on the surface of the as-
formed Al 2O3particles.
The conversion of Al(OH) 3to Al 2O3and formation of
the Al 2O3- ZnCr 2O4composite powder with the mentioned
microstructure could improve some of the characteristicsowned by the as-synthesized ZnCr 2O4powder. One of the
most important parameters in ﬂuencing the photo catalytic
activity is the speci ﬁc surface area32that would be cer-
tainly in ﬂuenced by the particles morphology. Figure 5

provided in Table 1.
Figure 5A shows the physical adsorption-desorption iso-
therm of the Al 2O3- ZnCr 2O4, ZnCr 2O4, and TiO 2-P25
samples. It is clear that the feature of the as-synthesized
Al2O3- ZnCr 2O4composite is similar to type IV in the
IUPAC classi ﬁcation features, whereas the shapes of the
ZnCr 2O4and TiO 2-P25 samples are more similar to type V
and III, respectively. This means that the interaction
between the particles surface and N 2is stronger in the
composite powder in comparison to the bare ZnCr 2O4and
TiO 2-P25 samples. Although the types of the isotherm
plots are not similar, both of the samples (Al 2O3-ZnCr 2O4
and ZnCr 2O4) can be considered as mesoporous
materials. The calculated mean pore diameters of theAl2O3- ZnCr 2O4, ZnCr 2O4, and TiO 2-P25 samples are
about 4.5, 10, and 15 nm, respectively, supporting this
assumption.
According to Figure 5B, the slope of the BET line of the
composite powder is less than that of the bare and TiO 2-P25
samples. The calculated values con ﬁrmed that the speci ﬁc
surface area of the composite powder was ~250 m2/g, which
is approximately ﬁve times greater than those of the bare
ZnCr 2O4and TiO 2-P25 samples ( as=47 and 43 m2/g, respec-
tively). The mean pore size and total pore volume of the
composite sample were ~4.5 nm and ~0.28 cm3/g, about
two times smaller and two times greater than those of the
ZnCr 2O4sample, respectively. The BET results showed that
using Al(OH) 3in the preparation process led to form a pow-
der with higher surface area and pore volume and smaller

tributed throughout the sample. The SEM images con ﬁrm
thisﬁnding (see Figure 4D,E). According to Table 1, Vm
(adsorbed-N 2volume) values show a sharp elevation by
applying ZnCr 2O4on Al 2O3particles. This can be related to
the formation of high textural porosity by distributing of the
as-synthesized ZnCr 2O4on the Al 2O3surface and generating
interparticle spaces. This event affects the pore volume. The
total pore volume andVpvalues of the Al 2O3- ZnCr 2O4sam-
ple are two times greater than those of ZnCr 2O4powder. The
other important parameter determining the speci ﬁc surface
area ( as) is the pore size. This parameter is determined as
mean pore diameter andrp,peak . The average pore diameter
of Al 2O3- ZnCr 2O4is less than that of ZnCr 2O4. This was
achieved from BET, BJH, and DH results. The reason has
been explained before. These two matters (increase in the
pore volume and decrease in the pore size) lead to increase
the speci ﬁc surface area, which is very important in enhanc-
ing the photocatalytic behaviors.
In other words, the textural characteristics of the Al 2O3-
ZnCr 2O4nanocomposite powder are superior to ZnCr 2O4
NPs, due to more surface positions for crystallization, dis-persing and growth of ZnCr
2O4NPs, and as a consequence
the agglomeration would be restricted. Thus, it is predicted
that higher surface area accelerates the accessibility of reac-
tant molecules to the catalytic sites of ZnCr 2O4. The BJH
and DH results support the BET and SEM observations.
The optical absorption spectra (UV-DRS) of the sam-
ples are illustrated in Figure 6A. Estimation of the Egval-
ues based on the Tauc method is provided in Figure 6B.
As can be observed, the ZnCr 2O4sample absorbed the
light at 250-600 nm wavelength regions with low intensity,
whereas the as-synthesized composite powder is character-
ized by a high absorbance at 250-500 nm. This means that
although the preparation of ZnCr 2O4on the surface ofAl2O3particles led to intensify the absorption peaks, the
absorption region is restricted to a narrower wavelength
region. In the case of TiO 2-P25, only the subtractive
absorption in the region of wavelength more than 400 nm
is detected and the area under curve of this powder is
very fewer than those of the as-synthesized ZnCr 2O4and
Al2O3-ZnCr 2O4.
Since Cr ion contains unpaired electrons in d orbital,
the d-d transition of Cr-containing materials determines
their behavior under UV-visible illumination. The Cr-d3
coordination in ZnCr 2O4and Al 2O3-ZnCr 2O4powder are
not similar. In the case of ZnCr 2O4, there are three small
bands at around 250, 330, and 580 nm, corresponding to
an octahedral environment. The bands characteristics of this
coordination are as below:4A2g?4T1g(P) in 200-300 nm,
4A2g?4T1g(F) in <450 nm, and4A2g?4T2gin<580 nm.22
This is in good agreement with the obtained results.
The other part of this ﬁgure is related to Al 2O3-ZnCr 2O4
powder. As can be seen, there are two relatively intense
bands at around 255 and 360 nm, and also one small band
at 580 nm. The latter is assigned to the transition of4A2g
to4T2gand not important due to its low intensity. The
other peaks are similar to those of ZnCr 2O4powder and
assigned to the transition of4A2gto4T1g. The ﬁrst peak at
around 255 nm can be related to band gap absorption of
Al2O3-ZnCr 2O4powder. For this reason, the Egvalues
were about 1.8 and 2.3 eV for the ZnCr 2O4and Al 2O3-
ZnCr 2O4samples, respectively. Considering that the Eg
value of Al 2O3is about 8.8 eV, the difference between Eg
values of Al 2O3and the as-synthesized ZnCr 2O4is 7 eV,
creating a band offset for the as-synthesized Al 2O3-
ZnCr 2O4in the range of 1.8-8.8 eV. The obtained results
show that this value is about 2.3 eV. Although this phe-
nomenon has been reported for Al 2O3- ZnO33and Al 2O3-
SnO34systems, this is the ﬁrst demonstration for the
ZnCr 2O4NPs.
Figure 7 shows the in ﬂuences of the as-prepared sam-
ples and TiO 2-P25 on the degradation of MB after 2 h
of UV irradiation. As can be seen, 2 h of irradiation to
MB suspension led to decrease its concentration about
20%. Considering the black line (2 h irradiated MB sus-
pension) as an indicator of comparison, it is clear that
the ZnCr 2O4, TiO 2-P25, and Al 2O3- ZnCr 2O4samples
caused ~14%, 40% and 86% MB degradation, respec-
tively. This phenomenon might be related to the photo-
catalytic performance of the powder samples, con ﬁrming
the higher ef ﬁciency of the as-synthesized Al 2O3-
ZnCr 2O4sample in comparison with the pristine ZnCr 2O4
or TiO 2-P25 NPs.
These promising achievements maybe related to the
increase of the active sites of modi ﬁed ZnCr 2O4NPs by
depositing on Al 2O3particles. Actually, this improvement
occurs with the increase in the speci ﬁc surface area of theTABLE 1 The values of speci ﬁc surface area and pore characteristics

toactivity is improving in respect to the surface area of
photocatalyst particles.35This means that the recombination
rate is more than the surface generation rate. In the case of
ZnCr 2O4NPs, the recombination rate would be slower than
that of Al 2O3- ZnCr 2O4, demonstrating the short lifetime of
photogenerated carriers of ZnCr 2O4NPs and was remark-
ably enhanced after the formation of the mentioned NPs on
the surface of Al 2O3particles. Therefore, it can be con-
cluded that the stability of photogenerated electron-holepairs in Al 2O3- ZnCr 2O4sample are as long as required to
expedite a reaction on the surface. This phenomenon may
be refers to the photocatalytic activity could be correlated
with the relationship between the speci ﬁc surface area and
the surface reaction rate.
Multiple promotion in ﬂuences on the absorbance (see
Figure 6A) and photoactivity (see Figure 7) of ZnCr 2O4
NPs by deposition on Al 2O3particles can be observed.
The photocatalytic activity was reported to be propor-tional to the degree of crystallinity,

smaller crystallite size, and larger surface area. The ﬁrst
one is a signi ﬁcant parameter to analyses the photo-
induced behaviors of semiconductors. It has been
reported that this behavior enhances with increase in the
degree of crystallinity.38The smaller crystallite size the
more speci ﬁc surface area, providing more active sites to
exhibit more effective photoactivity. On the other hand,size of the crystallites affects the semiconductor band
gap, recombination rate, and redox ability. The smaller
crystallite size the more powerful redox ability. It is due
to this fact that decrease in crystallite size may induce
increase in band gap energy, reducing electron-hole
recombination rate.
39Therefore, any agent can lead to
change the parameters such as crystallinity, speci ﬁc sur-
face area, and crystallite size, incurring the characteristics
such as photocatalytic activity and absorbance.
The mentioned process in this manuscript leads to form
ZnCr 2O4NPs on the surface of Al 2O3particles, preventing
the agglomeration, increasing the speci ﬁc surface area,
decreasing the pore size, and increasing the pore volume.
As the absorption is a surface area phenomenon, the higher
absorption intensity of the as-synthesized composite pow-
der is related to the existence of Al 2O3particles. This is
because of the in ﬂuence of Al 2O3particles which will
inﬂuence how ZnCr 2O4NPs are precipitated and formedwith smaller crystallite size and higher speci ﬁc surface area
(see Table 1 and Figures 2,5).
The characteristics of the as-synthesized composite pow-
der make it a remarkable candidate for the applications that
require high chemical and thermal stability, high adsorbility
and enhanced photocatalytic activity, porous structure and
high volume to mass ratio.
4|CONCLUSION
The Al 2O3- ZnCr 2O4nanocomposite powder was synthe-
sized in situ by a heterogeneous precipitation technique
using zinc acetate dehydrate, chromium nitrate, aluminum
hydroxide powder, and urea precipitation agent. With
regard to other methods, the motivation of the mentioned
technique is to decrease the agglomeration process (which
is inevitable during NPs preparation), to increase the speci-ﬁc surface area and therefore to facilitate the photocatalytic
reaction in the active sites of ZnCr
2O4particles on the sur-
faces of alumina micron-sized particles. The obtained
results clearly validate the performance of the proposed
method for increasing the surface area and pore volume
and therefore improving the photoactivity of the as-synthe-
sized Al 2O3- ZnCr 2O4nanocomposite in comparison with
the ZnCr 2O4NPs. As the Al 2O3particles and ZnCr 2O4
NPs were formed simultaneously, the Al 2O3particles act as

agglomeration. This process leads to enhance the UV
absorbance, photocatalytic behavior and dye removal ef ﬁ-
ciency with respect to pristine ZnCr 2O4NPs. However, the
dye removal ef ﬁciency reached to 86% after 2 h of UV
irradiation which is higher than that of the commercial
TiO 2-P25 NPs and the pure ZnCr 2O4NPs. Therefore, a
novel photocatalyst composite powder has been prepared
with low cost and high performance for the dye removal
process.
