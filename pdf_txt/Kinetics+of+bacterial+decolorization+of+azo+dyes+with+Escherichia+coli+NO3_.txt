Introduction  
 
Ever since the beginning of mankind, 
people have been using colorants for 
painting and dyeing their surroundings, 
their skins and their cloths. With the rapid 
industrialization, now there are more tha n 
1,00,000 commercially available dyes and 
7×105metric tons of dyestuffs are produced 
annually (Wong and Yu, 1999). Dyes are 
used in textile industry, leather tanning 
industry, paper industry, food industry, hair 
coloring and cosmetics. Azo dyes constitute  
largest group of synthetic dyes.  These are 
extensively used for dyeing fabrics in textile   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
industries. The textile dyeing generates a 
large amount of waste water containing 
dyes and represents one of the largest 
causes o f water pollution (Bhatti , et al.,  
2008), as 10 -15% of dyes are lost in the 
effluent during the dyeing process. It is very 
difficult to treat textile industry effluents 
because of their high BOD, COD, heat, 
color, pH and presence of metal ions 
(Anjali , et al., 2007) . Azo dyes are used 
increasingly in industries. Most azo dyes are 
toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic (Pinherio 
et al.,  2004) . In addition to this, the dyes

Synthetic dyes are extensively used in textile industries and other industries. 
Methyl orange is one such azo dye, which is  widely used in textile industries 
and also as an indicator in chemical laboratories. This study focuses on the 
capability of Bacillus  sp. Strain AK1 to decolorize Methyl Orange dye. 
Various parameters like time course, initial dye concentration, pH and 
temperature were optimized to achieve maximum decolorization of the dye. 
The bacterium exhibited remarkable color removable capability over a wide 
range of dye concentration, pH and temperature. The bacterial strain 
decolorized Methyl orange (200mg/l) upto85 % in 24 hours of incubation at 
pH7 and temperature 370c. The efficiency decreased with the increase in 
initial dye concentration. The pH also had a great impact upon the 
decolorizing ability.

 173 may significantly affect photosynthetic 
activity of aquatic life by decreasing light 
absorp tion and also may be toxic due to the 
presence of aromatics or heavy metals 
(Saratale et al.,  2006; Vajayanant  and 
Hemapriya, 2013). Traditional waste water 
treatment methods have proven to be 
ineffective because of the chemical stability 
of these pollutan ts. Azo bonds present in 
these dyes are resistant to breakdown with 
the potential for the persistence and 
accumulation in the environment (Telke 
Amar et al). A wide range of methods have 
been developed for the removal of synthetic 
dyes from waste waters. B ioremediation of 
textile effluents through microorganisms 
has been of considerable significance since 
it is inexpensive, eco -friendly and produces 
less amount af sludge. A wide variety of 
microorganisms are reported to be capable 
of decolorization of azo d yes. Considering 
the advantages and potential applications of 
bioremediation processes in textile effluent 
treatment, the present study deals with the 
bioremediation of Methyl Orange, a 
synthetic sulfonated textile azo dye by 
bacterial strain.  
 
Materials a nd Methods  
 
Bacterial Culture  
 
Bacillus  sp. Strain AK1 was previously 
isolated from dye contaminated soil sample 
collected around  the Dyeing Industries, 
Solapur, India. This strain was capable of 
decolorizing azo dyes efficiently. This 
strain was grown und er static condition at 
room temperature in Luria -Bertani (LB) 
broth.  
 
Dyes and Media  
 
The azo dye Methyl Orange was procured 
from sd fine chemicals ltd. Dye was 
checked for its color, solubility in water and absorption maximum. The mineral salt 
medium was prepared w ith following 
composition (g/l) : K 2HPO 4 (6.3), KH 2PO 4 
(1.8), NaCl (5), NH 4NO 3 (1), MgSO 4.7H 2O 
(0.1), MnSO 4 (0.1), CaCl 2.2H 2O (0.1), 
FeSO 4.7H 2O (0.1), NaMoO 7. 7H2O (0.006). 
The final pH of the medium was adjusted to 
7.2. The mineral salt medium wa s 
supplemented with yeast extract (2.5g/l), 
peptone (5g/l) and Methyl orange dye 
(200mg/l). All the chemicals used in this 
study were of analytical grade.  
 
Decolorization Experiments  
 
The decolorization experiments were 
performed in 250ml Erlenmeyer flasks  
containing MS medium. Methyl Orange 
(200mg/l) was added to decolorization 
medium and inoculated with 2ml of cultures 
broth. The flasks were incubated at 40oc 
under static conditions till the 
decolorization was completed.  
 
Analytical methods for dye 
decol orization studies  
 
The samples were withdrawn at different 
time intervals and analyzed for 
decolorization efficiency. Decolorization 
was quantitatively analyzed by measuring 
the absorbance of the supernatant using a 
UV-Visible spectrophotometer at maximum 
wavelength.  λmaxfor Methyl Orange was 
465nm. Decolorization percentage was 
calculated by using the equation

Study of Physico -chemical parameters  
  
Decolorization ability of strain AK1 on 
Methyl Orange was studied at different pH

 174 (5-9), temperature values (15 -50oC), dye 
concentration (200 -1000mg/l) etc. The 
effect of these physicochemical factors was 
studied. It was observed that pH 7.2 and 
temperature 37oc were found to be optimal 
for the decolorization activity. Effect of 
other fact ors was studied at pH 7.2 and 
temperature 37oC. 
 
Results and Discussion  
 
Time course for decolorization of Methyl 
Orange  
 
At an early 6 hours of incubation 10% of 
decolorization was exhibited by the strain 
AK1. It showed 30% decolorization in 12 
hours, 79%  decolorization in 24 hours and 
85% decolorization in 30 hours. The 
experiment was carried out by taking 
200mg/l dye at pH 7 and temperature 370C. 
 
Effect of initial dye concentration  
 
The decolorization of Methyl orange was 
carried out at different initia l dye 
concentrations from 200mg to 1000mg/l. 
The decolorization percentage of Methyl 
orange decreased with increase in the 
concentration of the dye under static 
conditions. Lower decolorization 
percentage at high dye concentration was reported. This might be due to the inhibitory 
effects of high dye concentration.  
 
Effect of pH on dye decolorization  
 
The effect of pH on the decolorization of 
Methyl Orange was determined over a wide 
range of pH from 4 to 9. The strain showed 
maximum dye decolorization at pH 7. At 
this optimum pH, the strain showed 85% 
decolorization of Methyl Orange. No 
decolorization was observed at pH 4. The 
strain showed 10%, 77%, 80% and 74% 
decolorization at pH 5, pH 6, pH 8 and pH9 
respectively.  
 
Effect of temperature on dye 
decolorizat ion 
 
The decolorization of the dye was tested for 
a wide range of temperatures from 15 to 
50oc. Increase in decolorization of Methyl 
Orange was observed with the increase in 
temperature and it was optimum at 37oc. 
Further increase in the temperature result ed 
in decreased percentage of decolorization. 
The decrease in dye decolorizationat high 
temperature can be attributed to the decline 
in microbial activity that led to the 
inactivation of the enzyme and eventually 
loss of cell viability.

Conclusion  
 
Bacterial decolorization proves to be a very 
efficient method for complete 
decolorization  of Methyl Orange. The 
purpose of this study is to investigate the 
decolorization of Methyl Orange by 
Bacillus  sp. Strain AK1. The bacteria 
successf ully decolorize Methyl orange. 
Most markedly the strain could effectively 
decolorize the dye, Methyl orange over dye 
concentrations of 200 -800mg/l, pH of 5 -9 
and temperature 20 -50oc. Decolorization 
with Bacillus  sp. AK1 yields high 
maximum decolorization a ctivity of 85% at 
dye concentration 200mg/l, pH 7 and 
temperature 37oc. It can be concluded that 
Bacillus  sp. AK1 is highly promising and 
suitable microorganism for use in the 
treatment of textile waste water.
