Introduction
Synthetic dyes are unsaturated poly-aromatic molecules 
which are soluble or dispersible in water or solvent and give 
a permanent color to materials like textile fabrics. These dyes 
are extensively used in various industries such as textile, 
paper, food, leather, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries 
[1]. Among the different industries, textile industries are the 
largest consumer of synthetic dyes. Over 10,000 synthetic 
dyes (including several varieties) with an estimated annual 
production of 700000 metric tons are commercially available 
worldwide [2]. These dyes can be classified in a number of ways, 
including color, intended use, trade name, chemical constitution 
and on the basis of their application. Chemical classes of dyes 
generally azo, triphenylmethane and anthraquinone have been 
utilized more frequently at industrial scale [3]. Among the 
different synthetic dyes, azo dyes account for more than one half 
(60-70%) of all dyestuffs produced and are the largest and most 
commonly group of dyes used in textile industries. Azo dyes are 
characterized by aromatics substituted with one or more azo 
groups (-N=N-) [4]. The textile industry is one of the greatest 
generators of dye containing wastewater. During textile dyeing 
process all dyes do not bind to the fabric due to inefficiency 
in dyeing process. The amount of dyes lost through textile 
wastewater is dependent upon the class of dye utilized, shifting 
from 2% for basic dyes to 50% for reactive dyes. Roughly, 20% 
of these unused dyestuffs directly enter in the environment 
through textile wastewater because a large portion of these 
dyes escape conventional wastewater treatment processes [5]. 
The textile industry wastewater has adverse impacts in terms of   
Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), 
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), total suspended solids (TDS), 
salinity, color, a wide range of pH (5-12) and the recalcitrance of 
organic compounds, such as azo dyes [6]. 
Toxicity of dyes
Many synthetic dyes are highly visible at concentrations 
less than 1mg lit-1 in water. The dye concentrations in the textile 
processing wastewaters are generally in the range of 10-200mg 
lit-1. The majority of dyes represent a potential danger to all 
forms of life. These dyes may cause allergic responses, skin 
dermatoses, eczema [7], and also affect the liver, lungs, vasco-
circulatory system, immune system and even the reproductive 
system of experimental animals as well as humans [8]. The 
release of these dyes into water bodies is potentially toxic to 
aquatic life. In addition, many azo dyes and their degradation 
intermediates are toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic to life forms 
[9].
Current treatment processes for removal of dyes
Several methods were adapted for the reduction of dyes 
to achieve decolorization. The use of one individual process 
may often not be sufficient to achieve complete decolorization 
because each technique has its limitations. Various physico-
chemical methods such as adsorption, coagulation, precipitation, 
filtration, oxidation, ozonation, Fenton’s reagent, electrochemical 
destruction and photocatalysis may have potential for treatment 
of dyes containing textile wastewater but these methods 
have many drawbacks. These technologies usually involve

Abstract
Azo dyes are widely used in textile industries for coloring the fabrics. These industries produced a large amount of wastewater 
contaminated with azo dyes which may be toxic to all life forms. Therefore, removal of dyes from wastewater is necessary prior to their 
disposal. The biological methods are an inexpensive and environment friendly way for the degradation of dyes from textile wastewater. 
Different taxonomic group of microorganisms are used in the biological treatments of textile dyes.

Current Trends in Biomedical Engineering & Biosciences complicated procedures and an economically unfeasible [10-
11]. It is, therefore, necessary to develop an efficient, cost-
effective and viable alternative method for the decolorization 
and degradation of dyes in textile effluents.
Biological Treatment process
The biological treatment processes using a wide range of 
microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, yeast and algae) can overcome 
the limitations because it is cost competitive, produces less 
amount of sludge and eco-friendly alternative to conventional 
physico-chemical treatment [12]. Different trophic groups of 
bacteria (for example, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Halomonas  
etc.) have been reported that can achieve a higher degree 
of decolorization and degradation of many azo dyes under 
optimum conditions as compare to other microbes [9-13]. The 
bacterial system may be capable to decolorize the azo dyes 
under anaerobic and aerobic condition or involve a combination 
of the two [14]. 
Mechanism of bacterial degradation of azo dyes
The initial step in the bacterial degradation of azo dyes is 
the reductive cleavage of highly electrophilic azo bond under 
static, anoxic or anaerobic conditions which leads to the 
formation of colorless aromatic amines. This process may be 
catalyzed by soluble cytoplasmic enzymes (azoreductase), 
low molecular weight redox mediators, chemical reduction by 
biogenic reductants like sulfide, or a combination of them [1]. 
The resulting products are colorless aromatic amines which 
are further degraded to simpler non-toxic forms by multiple-
step bioconversion occurring aerobically or anaerobically [9]. 
It has also been reported that the treatment systems composed 
of mixed microbial populations/consortium have higher level of 
biodegradation and mineralization due to synergistic metabolic 
exercises of microbial group and offers significant points of 
interest over the utilization of pure cultures in the decolorization 
and degradation of synthetic azo dyes [15]. 
Conclusion
Azo dyes are the commonly used dyes in textile industries. 
The improper disposal of these dyes in the environment has 
serious environmental concern. Several physico-chemical 
methods have been used for the treatment of dye containing 
wastewater but these methods have many limitations. As an 
alternative over physico-chemical methods, biological treatment 
methods are seen as an attractive solution for the treatment of 
textile dye containing wastewater.
