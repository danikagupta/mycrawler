Abstract: Octahydro-1, 3, 5, 7-tetranitro-1, 3, 5, 7-tetrazocine (HMX) is extensively exploited in the
manufacturing of explosives; therefore, a signiÔ¨Åcant level of HMX contamination can be encountered
near explosive production plants. For instance, up to 12 ppm HMX concentrations have been ob-
served in the wastewater efÔ¨Çuent of a munitions manufacturing facility, while up to 45,000 mg/kg of
HMX has been found in a soil sample taken from a location close to a high-explosive production site.
Owing to their immense demand for a variety of applications, the large-scale production of explosives
has culminated in severe environmental issues. Soil and water contaminated with HMX can pose
a detrimental impact on Ô¨Çora and fauna and hence, remediation of HMX is paramount. There is a
rising demand to establish a sustainable technology for HMX abatement. Physiochemical and biore-
mediation approaches have been employed to treat HMX in the soil, groundwater, and wastewater.
It has been revealed that treatment methods such as photo-peroxidation and photo-Fenton oxidation
can eliminate approximately 98% of HMX from wastewater. Fenton‚Äôs reagents were found to be very
effective at mineralizing HMX. In the photocatalytic degradation of HMX, approximately 59% TOC
removal was achieved by using a TiO 2photocatalyst, and a dextrose co-substrate was used in a biore-
mediation approach to accomplish 98.5% HMX degradation under anaerobic conditions. However,
each technology has some pros and cons which need to be taken into consideration when choosing an
HMX remediation approach. In this review, various physiochemical and bioremediation approaches
are considered and the mechanism of HMX degradation is discussed. Further, the advantages and
disadvantages of the technologies are also discussed along with the challenges of HMX treatment
technologies, thus giving an overview of the HMX remediation strategies.

1. Introduction
The application of diverse kinds of explosives in propelling rockets, the military, ar-
tilleries manufacturing, the mining industry, and construction is well recognized [ 1‚Äì3]. One
of the most commonly used explosives is octahydro-1, 3, 5, 7-tetranitro-1, 3, 5, 7-tetrazocine,
also referred to as high melting explosive (HMX). HMX is also widely recognized as an
octogen as well as cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine [4]. Some important applications of
HMX include the manufacturing of explosives and nuclear devices, utilization as raw ma-
terial in propellant formulations, and artillery shells as burster chargers [ 5‚Äì8]. Additionally,
HMX is often used as a vital component of secondary explosives, viz., HTA-3 [8].
Owing to its high stability, high detonation heat, and high detonation velocity, HMX
has been the most extensively exploited energetic chemical for both military and commercial
applications [ 5,9,10]. HMX is a heterocyclic compound consisting of an eight-membered
ring [ 11,12]. HMX can exist in four different crystalline phases, viz., ,,, and [13,14].

Under ambient conditions, -HMX is recognized to be thermodynamically stable among
all phases and -HMX is usually more vulnerable than -HMX. The bandgap inÔ¨Çuences

is-HMX < - HMX < - HMX < - HMX [ 13]. Figure 1 depicts the trend in HMX-
related publications and citations from 2000 to 2022, demonstrating the signiÔ¨Åcance of

HTA-3 [8].  
Owing to its high stability, high detonati on heat, and high detonation velocity, HMX 
has been the most extensively exploited ener getic chemical for both military and commer-
cial applications [5,9,10]. HMX is a heterocy clic compound consisting of an eight-mem-
bered ring [11,12]. HMX can exist in four different crystalline phases, viz., Œ±, Œ≤, Œ¥, and Œ≥ 
[13,14]. Under ambient conditions, Œ≤-HMX is recognized to be thermodynamically stable 
among all phases and Œ¥-HMX is usually more vulnerable than Œ≤-HMX. The bandgap in-
fluences the sensitivity of the four HMX polymorphs. The order of sensitivity for HMX 
polymorphs is Œ≤-HMX < Œ≥- HMX < Œ±- HMX < Œ¥- HMX [13]. Figure 1 depicts the trend in 
HMX-related publications and citations from 2000 to 2022, demonstrating the significance of HMX-based investigations.

Explosive materials and/or their residues can be detected around explosive produc-
tion plants, military firing ranges, or munitions utilization areas [12,15,16]. A significant amount of explosive-contaminated wastewater is released during the production of ex-
plosives which contaminates the surface water resources [6]. It is noteworthy that because 
of their high mobility in the soil as well as low adsorption, HMX can also cause ground-
water contamination [8,17,18]. Additionally, the existence of HMX in the soil can ad-
versely affect the soil profile and the diversity of microbial communities can be reduced which affects the natural degradation capabili ties of soil with explosive contaminants. 
Various groundwater, wastewater , and soil samples have been reported to contain vary-
ing amounts of HMX (Table 1).

The occurrence of explosive pollutants in the aquatic environment and soil causes
severe environmental pollution [ 26]. Contamination caused by the release of large amounts
of HMX has become a compelling environmental dilemma across the world [ 26,27]. A
low octanol-water partition coefÔ¨Åcient (k ow0.06) [ 28], as well as poor water solubility-
5 mg/L at 25C [29], makes HMX a recalcitrant chemical, and its long-term persistence in
the environment warrants its sustainable removal [ 6,8]. Soil and water contamination by
different explosives are well known but there has been no substantial progress on treatment
approaches and understanding of the fate of explosives and their byproducts [7].
HMX is known to be mutagenic and carcinogenic for human beings and is classiÔ¨Åed
as a Class D carcinogen [ 17,27,30]. Exposure to HMX can trigger acute poisoning, epilepsy,
nausea, convulsions, and loss of consciousness [ 31]. HMX accumulation in the heart, kidney,
liver, and brain has been reported and additionally, the liver and central nervous system
can also be affected by HMX [ 31]. Furthermore, the degradation byproducts (as a result
of the environmental impact) of HMX can also pose severe environmental threats even if
present in low concentrations [ 32]. The detrimental impact of HMX on the soil proÔ¨Åle is
well documented as it affects the soil‚Äôs microbial community and population [20,22,31].
Different concentrations of HMX in the soil has been reported by many
researchers [ 14,20,33]. In the United States and Europe, HMX is recognized as a key control
pollutant [ 26]. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has set 0.04 mg/L as the
acceptable limit for HMX in drinking water [ 30]. However, a signiÔ¨Åcant concentration of
HMX has been detected in different efÔ¨Çuents [ 6,25]. To meet the guidelines and reduce the
harmful effect of HMX on the environment, it is crucial to treat HMX in an eco-friendly
manner. However, many obstacles are associated with the treatment of HMX efÔ¨Çuents due
to their highly acidic nature and high COD levels [ 6]. Wastewater from the explosive and
ammunitions industries contains huge amounts of contaminants with signiÔ¨Åcant concentra-
tions of nitrate and various organic nitro-compounds such as 2,4,6- trinitrotoluene (TNT),
hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), HMX, nitroglycerine, etc. In addition, various
chemicals such as hexamine, CH 3COOH, NH 4+, HNO 3, and NO 3 have been detected
in the HMX production efÔ¨Çuents. Further, RDX usually exists in HMX wastewater as a
co-contaminant [ 6,30]. The composition of HMX-contaminated wastewater from different
sites is displayed in Figure 2 [6,25].
Due to the heterogeneous composition of wastewater efÔ¨Çuent of explosive production
plants, it is challenging to develop an effective and inexpensive treatment technology.
However, there is a growing need for the development of economically viable and efÔ¨Åcient
treatment technology for HMX-contaminated groundwater, wastewater, and soil.

2. HMX Remediation Approaches 
In the past, several initiatives have been ta ken to develop a suitable approach for the 
treatment of HMX and other explosive chem icals in the soil and contaminated water 
[6,14,15,29,34]. The treatment approach can be categorized as a physicochemical or bio-
logical approach based on the treatment prin ciple. Physiochemical remediation and bio-
remediation are the major approach es for HMX abatement [12,30,35] .  
2.1. Physicochemical Remediation  
Various physicochemical remediation meth ods have been investigated for HMX re-
mediation from the soil, groundwater, and wa stewater. Some of them are adsorption, re-
duction, incineration, advanced oxidation pr ocesses (AOPs), alkaline hydrolysis, etc. 
[1,25,36‚Äì47]. Section 2.1 is a discussion of the various physicochemical remediation ap-
proaches; some physicochemical remediation approaches are listed in Table 2.

2.1.1. Adsorption
The adsorption technique has been extensively employed in the removal of hazardous
pollutants and is acknowledged to be a very promising approach owing to its high se-
lectivity and cost-efÔ¨Åcacy [ 53‚Äì57]. The commercially available and synthesized activated
carbon-based adsorption of toxic pollutants has been reported by many researchers [ 58,59].
Various low-cost materials have also been examined to develop efÔ¨Åcient activated car-
bon [ 58]. The efÔ¨Åciency of granular activated carbon (GAC) for the adsorption of HMX
from contaminated groundwater was evaluated using a small-scale column [ 36]. Different
types of GACs were selected for this study and among all, the Calgon F400 sample was
found to be very effective in HMX removal. Explosive-loaded GAC was regenerated by
using bio-regeneration where explosive-loaded GAC was degraded in a bioreactor [ 59].
It was noted that HMX reduced from 0.6 mg/L to 0.4 mg/L in 4 days. Furthermore, the
silica-based adsorbent was employed for HMX adsorption where ammonium perchlorate
oxidation was utilized for the preparation of mesoporous silicas which showed abundant
surface silanol groups [ 50]. The ammonium perchlorate (AP)-HNO 3treated SBA-15 showed
4.7mol/g adsorption capacity for HMX.

In another study, HMX removal was investigated using solid-phase extraction on
activated carbon prepared using spent coffee grounds [ 60]. Furthermore, the efÔ¨Åcacy of
various cellulosic material-based adsorbents on the adsorptive removal of various explo-
sives, along with HMX, from stormwater was also examined [ 61]. Cationized pine shavings
and burlap material surpassed all other materials assessed. In addition, the efÔ¨Åciency of
commercially available cationized adsorbent materials was investigated. The efÔ¨Åciency of
cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) was investigated for the removal of ppb level
(0.6 ppb) HMX from groundwater using a rapid small-scale column test [ 19]. In another
study, Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-copoly(acrylic acid) hydrogels were synthesized for
the abatement of HMX and other pollutants [ 52]. Batch adsorption was conducted to
evaluate the removal efÔ¨Åciency of synthesized hydrogels. The impact of parameters, viz.,
temperature and pH, on the swelling of hydrogels was investigated and it was demon-
strated that the hydrogels are very stable and could be a potential candidate for the removal
of pollutants.
Two different types of soils, viz., agricultural topsoil (VT, 8.4% TOC) and sandy soil
(SSL, 0.33% TOC), were utilized for the study of HMX sorption and degradation [ 51]. HMX
adsorption on soil was performed at room temperature and it was noted that the TOC
content of the soil did not pose any signiÔ¨Åcant impact on HMX removal. Further, the
removal of HMX was investigated using different nanocomposites, viz., -Fe2O3-rGO and
nZVI-rGO [ 37]. Batch mode adsorption experiments were performed for HMX removal.
Contact time, pH, and adsorbent dosage were among the parameters that were optimized;
the Freundlich isotherm was suitable for isotherm data.
2.1.2. Reduction
Zero-valent iron is very effective in organic pollutant degradation. The ability of
nanoscale Zero-valent iron (nZVI) for the treatment of HMX and other explosives from
wastewater was evaluated [ 40]. For this study, nZVI was fabricated by the co-precipitation
method. The surface area and diameter of synthesized nZVI were 42.56 m2/g and
20‚Äì50 nm, respectively. The LC/MS/MS technique was used for the conÔ¨Årmation of
HMX degradation byproducts (formaldehyde/methanol/hydrazine/dimethylhydrazine).
The Ô¨Ånding of the study indicated nZVI as an excellent candidate for the in situ degradation
of explosives containing wastewater. However, it is noteworthy that in the chemical reac-
tion, corrosion of nZVIs occurs due to the formation of Fe 3O4which affects the efÔ¨Åciency
of nZVIs.
In another study, the role of didecyldimethylammonium bromide (didecyl) surfactant
was examined for HMX destruction by zero-valent iron (Fe0) in contaminated soils [ 22].
It was revealed that a very low concentration of dodecyl (2% w/vwith 3% of Fe0(w/v)
is required for the destruction of solid-phase HMX. Further, ZVI was utilized for HMX
degradation under anoxic conditions [ 29]. It was demonstrated that two initial reactions,
(i) reduction of the N-NO 2group to the Ô¨Åve nitroso products and (ii) ring cleavage from
either HMX or 1NO-HMX, could be accountable for the degradation of HMX. Finally,
HCHO, NH 4+, NH 2NH 2, and N 2O were generated as HMX degradation byproducts. Due
to the presence of NH 2NH 2and HCHO, additional treatment is required.
The reduction of HMX in soil and groundwater samples was also examined using
nZVI nanocomposites [ 32]. Reduction experiments were conducted using different systems,
viz., batch, column, and a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) system. The batch mode
system offered a better performance in comparison to the other systems. HMX degradation
resulted in N 2O, CO 2, and CH 4via cleavage of the ring structure. Further, a reductive
technology using a bimetallic catalyst was developed for the abatement of HMX and other
explosives [ 39]. Two-phase reactors consisting of bimetallic particles and an aqueous stream
were used for the reductive technology where the bimetallic catalyst was prepared by
electroless deposition. It was reported that Fe/Ni and Fe/Cu can easily degrade explosives
and that the pH affects the degradation process.

2.1.3. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)
The efÔ¨Åciency of AOP techniques for organic pollutant degradation is well docu-
mented [ 62‚Äì66]. AOPs such as photocatalysis using various kinds of photocatalysts, Fenton
process, photo-Fenton, electro-assisted photo-Fenton processes, etc. have been investigated
for HMX abatement [6,25,30,42,48].
Photocatalysis
TiO 2photocatalyst was used for HMX degradation in explosives-contaminated wastew-
ater [ 43]. The inÔ¨Çuence of the initial concentration and pH on the HMX degradation and
mineralization was assessed. A higher degradation of HMX was recorded in the case
of low HMX concentration and a neutral pH was more effective in HMX degradation;
approximately 59% TOC removal was noted for HMX. NO 3 , NO 2 , and NH 4+were the
major byproducts. Similarly, in another report, photocatalytic degradation of HMX was
conducted using UV/TiO 2[41].
Catalytic as well as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using UV and hydrogen
peroxide were investigated for the oxidation of HMX in contaminated water [ 49]. Catalytic
oxidation was conducted using a 4.45 wt% Pt/TiO 2catalyst. For UV photolysis, H 2O2
was used as an oxidant and UV radiation was selected at 254 nm with experiments con-
ducted at ambient conditions. The temperature was found to have a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on
both catalytic and non-catalytic oxidation. Additionally, HMX degradation by UV/TiO 2
photocatalysis was conducted using a circular photocatalytic reactor [ 38]. The effect of
parameters, viz., photocatalyst dose, HMX initial concentration, and initial pH, on HMX
degradation was examined. It was observed that UV and TiO 2were not effective when used
alone. A remarkable effect was achieved when TiO 2and UV were used together during
the HMX degradation. A higher degradation rate was obtained in the neutral range of pH
and degradation kinetics followed pseudo-Ô¨Årst-order kinetics. TOC removal of 60% was
obtained within 150 min and higher degradation was observed when the TiO 2dose was
0.7 g/L. With a 5 mg/L concentration of HMX, the recovery of nitrogen was approximately
70%. Analysis of the degradation byproducts conÔ¨Årmed the presence of NO 3 , NO 2 , and
NH 4+in the treated samples.
Fenton and Photo-Fenton
The Fenton and photo-Fenton processes are effective in the abatement of numerous
organic pollutants, including explosives residue in water bodies and soil [ 42,67,68]. In the
study of Bhanot et al., the efÔ¨Åciency of different AOPs, viz., photolysis, photo-peroxidation,
and photo-Fenton oxidation, for the degradation of HMX from wastewater were exam-
ined [ 6]. The concentration of nitrate and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined
in treated samples. Both photo-peroxidation and photo-Fenton oxidation treatment ap-
proaches were able to remove approximately 98% of HMX from wastewater [ 6]. Zoh and
Stenstorm investigated the Fenton oxidation of HMX at pH 3.0 [ 30]; the resulting kinetic
data Ô¨Åt well with the pseudo-Ô¨Årst-order equation (Figure 3).
It was reported that the concentration of Fenton‚Äôs reagent affects the reaction rate. The
Ô¨Åndings of this report demonstrated that Fenton‚Äôs reagents can efÔ¨Åciently mineralize HMX,
resulting in the formation of nitrate as a byproduct of HMX oxidation. It was reported that
1.75 M NO 3 was generated per M HMX in the Fenton process when the experimental
parameters were as follows [Fe2+] 0.72 mmol/L, [H 2O2] 77.6 mmol/L, and HMX molar
concentration 0.015 mmol/L. Similarly, in another investigation, HMX-containing wastew-
ater was treated by the Fenton process [ 48]. Effects of H 2O2dosage, FeSO 47H2O dosage,
reaction time, and pH were examined and optimized for maximum degradation. A tem-
perature of 25C; pH 3.0, 0.2 mL of 1% H 2O2; 8.3 mL of 0.01% FeSO 47H2O concentration,
and a reaction time of 80 min were found to be optimum for the degradation of a 4 mg/L
HMX concentration. The efÔ¨Åciency of Fenton and photo-Fenton processes for HMX and
other explosive degradation was evaluated by Liou et al. [ 42]; enhanced HMX degradation
was achieved when a higher concentration of Fe (II) was used.

 approximately 59% TOC removal was noted for HMX. NO 3‚àí, NO 2‚àí, and NH 4+ were the 
major byproducts. Similarly, in another repo rt, photocatalytic degradation of HMX was 
conducted using UV/TiO 2 [41].  
Catalytic as well as advanced oxidation pr ocesses (AOPs) using UV and hydrogen 
peroxide were investigated for the oxidation of HMX in contaminated water [49]. Cata-
lytic oxidation was conducted using a 4.45 wt% Pt/TiO 2 catalyst. For UV photolysis, H 2O2 
was used as an oxidant and UV radiation wa s selected at 254 nm with experiments con-
ducted at ambient conditions. The temperature was found to have a significant impact on 
both catalytic and non-catalytic oxidation. Additionally, HMX degradation by UV/TiO 2 
photocatalysis was conducted using a circular photocatalytic reactor [38]. The effect of 
parameters, viz., photocatalyst dose, HMX initial concentration, and initial pH, on HMX degradation was examined. It was observed that UV and TiO
2 were not effective when 
used alone. A remarkable effect was achieved when TiO 2 and UV were used together dur-
ing the HMX degradation. A higher degradation rate was obtained in the neutral range of 
pH and degradation kinetics followed pseudo -first-order kinetics. TOC removal of 60% 
was obtained within 150 min and higher degradation was observed when the TiO 2 dose 
was 0.7 g/L. With a 5 mg/L concentration of HMX, the recovery of nitrogen was approxi-
mately 70%. Analysis of the degradation byproducts confirmed the presence of NO 3‚àí, 
NO 2‚àí, and NH 4+ in the treated samples. 
Fenton and Photo-Fenton 
The Fenton and photo-Fenton processes are effective in the abatement of numerous 
organic pollutants, including explosives residue in water bodies and soil [42,67,68]. In the 
study of Bhanot et al., the efficiency of di fferent AOPs, viz., photolysis, photo-peroxida-
tion, and photo-Fenton oxidation, for the deg radation of HMX from wastewater were ex-
amined [6]. The concentration of nitrate and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was deter-
mined in treated samples. Both photo-peroxi dation and photo-Fenton  oxidation treatment 
approaches were able to remove approximat ely 98% of HMX from wastewater [6]. Zoh 
and Stenstorm investigated the Fenton oxidatio n of HMX at pH 3.0 [30]; the resulting ki-
netic data fit well with the pseudo-first-order equation (Figure 3).

Furthermore, the electro-assisted Fenton process was utilized for HMX degradation
from actual wastewater [ 25]. The electro-assisted Fenton process resulted in a higher
degradation in comparison to Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. In the electro-assisted
Fenton process, hydroxyl(OH) radicals generate on the anode surface. It was stated that
the biodegradability of efÔ¨Çuents was enhanced after Fenton treatments which makes the
further treatment of efÔ¨Çuent by a biological approach more feasible. Formic acid and
three amino derivatives were identiÔ¨Åed as intermediate byproducts and after complete
mineralization, NO 3 , NH 4+CO 2, and water were detected in treated samples. The HMX
degradation mechanism is presented in Figure 4 [ 25]. In HMX degradation, at the initial
step, the carbon atoms of the heterocyclic ring are hydroxylated and the opening of the
heterocyclic nitramines ring results in the generation of formic acid, methylene dinitramine,
urea, and acetamide.
2.1.4. Other Physiochemical Approaches
Several other approaches such as incineration, alkaline hydrolysis, and utilization of
subcritical water for HMX degradation have been explored by many researchers [ 1,20,69,70].
The incineration technique has been widely used in past for the abatement of explosive-
contaminated soil, but this approach is afÔ¨Åliated with NOx emissions which is the main
downside of this technique [ 69,71]. Recently, rotary kiln incineration has been reported,
which demands less space than conventional incineration where hot gas is used to break
down explosive waste. However, similar challenges such as NOx emissions remain intact.
For the treatment of explosive waste, Ô¨Çuidized beds perform better than rotary kilns [ 69,70].
Alkaline hydrolysis is an economically feasible approach for HMX-contaminated wa-
ter. The HMX degradation mechanism in alkaline hydrolysis was examined in [ 1]. In this
study, HMX was hydrolyzed in an aqueous solution (pH 10‚Äì12.3) and the information on
the generated byproducts and degradation pathways was presented. In another study, 57%
elimination of HMX was reported for alkaline hydrolysis [ 21]. In addition, Heilmann et al.
investigated the alkaline hydrolysis of HMX [ 72]. For HMX hydrolysis kinetics, the tem-
perature varied from 50 to 80C while the pH range was selected in the alkaline range
from 10‚Äì12.

 It was reported that the concentration of Fe nton‚Äôs reagent affects the reaction rate. 
The findings of this report demonstrated that Fenton‚Äôs reagents can efficiently mineralize 
HMX, resulting in the formation of nitrate as a byproduct of HMX oxidation. It was re-ported that 1.75 M NO
3‚àí was generated per M HMX in the Fenton process when the ex-
perimental parameters were as follows [Fe2+] 0.72 mmol/L, [H 2O2] 77.6 mmol/L, and HMX 
molar concentration 0.015 mmol/L. Similarly, in another investigation, HMX-containing 
wastewater was treated by the Fenton process [48]. Effects of H 2O2 dosage, FeSO 4¬∑7H 2O 
dosage, reaction time, and pH were exam ined and optimized for maximum degradation. 
A temperature of 25 ¬∞C; pH 3.0, 0.2 mL of 1% H 2O2; 8.3 mL of 0.01% FeSO 4¬∑7H 2O concen-
tration, and a reaction time of 80 min were found to be optimum for the degradation of a 
4 mg/L HMX concentration. The efficiency of Fenton and photo-Fenton processes for HMX and other explosive degradation was eval uated by Liou et al. [42]; enhanced HMX 
degradation was achieved when a higher concentration of Fe (II) was used.  
Furthermore, the electro-assisted Fenton process was utilized for HMX degradation 
from actual wastewater [25]. Th e electro-assisted Fenton process resulted in a higher deg-
radation in comparison to Fenton and photo- Fenton processes. In the electro-assisted Fen-
ton process, hydroxyl (‚Ä¢OH) radicals generate on the ano de surface. It was stated that the 
biodegradability of effluents was enhanced af ter Fenton treatments which makes the fur-
ther treatment of effluent by a biological a pproach more feasible. Formic acid and three 
amino derivatives were identified as interm ediate byproducts and after complete miner-
alization, NO 3‚àí, NH 4+ CO 2, and water were detected in treated samples. The HMX degra-
dation mechanism is presented in Figure 4 [25]. In HMX degradation, at the initial step, 
the carbon atoms of the heterocyclic ring ar e hydroxylated and the opening of the hetero-
cyclic nitramines ring results in the genera tion of formic acid, methylene dinitramine, 
urea, and acetamide.

subcritical water for HMX degradation have been explored by many researchers

A pilot-scale study for the treatment of different explosives in soil was conducted using
subcritical (hot/liquid) water [ 20]. For this study, soil samples were gathered from defense
sites. SigniÔ¨Åcant degradation of HMX was obtained at 125C using subcritical water.
It was reported that HMX degradation generates byproducts that eventually degraded
to a 99.9% destruction and ca. 98% destruction of HMX. A toxicity assessment test of
processed wastewater or soil leachates using Vibrio Ô¨Åscheri in Microtox‚Äù acute toxicity tests
demonstrated no sign of toxicity.
2.2. Bioremediation
Another widely employed remediation approach for HMX treatment in soil, ground-
water, and wastewater is bioremediation, which includes aerobic/anaerobic biological
treatment, phytoremediation, soil mud reactor treatment and composting, etc. [ 8,34,73‚Äì78].
Biological treatment has been recommended as a potential approach for the treatment of
HMX contaminants as an environmentally sustainable alternative [ 23,79,80]. In this section,
we have reviewed microbial remediation and phytoremediation approaches.
Two bioremediation methods, viz., soil slurry reactor and land farming technique
were assessed for explosives-contaminated soil remediation [ 23]. The selected soil was
contaminated with varied explosives (TNT, RDX, and HMX) and the concentration of HMX
in the contaminated soil was approximately 900 mg/kg of pH 6.5 soil. Although the chosenInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 15948 10 of 21
methodology was effective in reducing HMX concentrations in soil, the removal efÔ¨Åciency
was slightly lower in contrast to other explosives (TNT and RDX). HMX biodegradation
has been explored across both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in several studies [ 4,9]. In
numerous research investigations, various microbial species have been explored for HMX
remediation (Table 3).

The HMX degradation in aerobic conditions was investigated by using Planomi-
crobium Ô¨Çavidum strain S5-TSA-19, which was extracted from explosive-contaminated
soil [ 4]. Approximately 70% of HMX was degraded in 20 days and methylenedintramine
(M.wt. 136 Da) and N-methyl-N,N0-dinitromethanediamine (M.wt.  149 Da) were pro-
duced from HMX degradation. It was reported that the Ô¨Årst-order kinetics Ô¨Åtted well
with the HMX degradation kinetic data. Furthermore, HMX aerobic biodegradation from
groundwater was studied. It was demonstrated that microbial consortia decreased the
HMX concentration from 6 to 1 mg/L within 5.2 days [ 84]; Ô¨Åve metabolites were identiÔ¨Åed
from HMX biodegradation.
In another study, Phanerochaete chrysosporium was used for the aerobic biodegradabil-
ity of HMX [ 83]. It was reported that 600 nmol of HMX can be degraded in 25 days of
incubation time when the 7 days old static P . chrysosporium liquid cultures were used for
biodegradation [ 83]. HMX reduction was proposed via the formation of its mono-nitroso
derivative (1-NO-HMX). Two possible routes for HMX degradation were suggested. The
Ô¨Årst possible route involved N-denitration followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage, while
R-hydroxylation followed by ring cleavage was reported as the second route. 4-nitro-2,4-
diazabutanal (NDAB), HCHO, NO 2 , and N 2O, were obtained from 1-NO-HMX degra-

dation. Two different soil samples contaminated with HMX were tested and considerable
mineralization was achieved in the presence of fungus. The present Ô¨Åndings demonstrate
the utility of the fungus P . chrysosporium for HMX remediation.
Wastewater generated from HMX production was treated using the aerobic granules
in an aerobic granular reactor and it was demonstrated that aerobic granular sludge was
effective in the separation of organic matter (97.57%) and nitrogen compounds (80%) within
40 days of treatment time [ 18]. In contrast to aerobic conditions, anaerobic treatment de-
grades HMX more effectively [ 15]. HMX degradation was investigated using mesophilic
anaerobic granules [ 5]. Biotic and abiotic mechanisms were both attributed to the HMX
degradation under mesophilic conditions. It is reported that 99.04% removal was achieved
using volatile suspended solids/L acclimated while 96.42% removal was obtained when
unacclimated granules were used. A considerable contribution of adsorption was observed
in the abiotic process. An inhibitor of methanogenic bacteria (2-bromoethanesulfonic acid)
affected the biotransformation of HMX and a slight inhibition in metabolic activity was re-
ported. A signiÔ¨Åcant impact was noted in the presence of an inhibitor of acetogenic bacteria
(Vancomycin ). HMX degradation in the presence of nitrate and sulfate was also investigated
and it was observed that nitrate had a signiÔ¨Åcant effect on HMX biotransformation by
anaerobic granules while sulfate had a minimal effect.
In another study, the impact of carbon substrate, viz., CH 3COOH, C 2H5OH, C 6H12O6,
and soluble starch on HMX biodegradation was explored [ 27]. A batch system was used
for the biodegradation of HMX using anaerobic mesophilic granular sludge. Glucose
and acetate sources offered a better performance in contrast to ethanol and soluble starch.
The carbon source concentration was found to be very critical in the biodegradation of
HMX. Further, Liu et al. explored the effect of various co-substrates on the degradation
of HMX from simulated wastewater under anaerobic conditions [ 74]. Enhanced biodegra-
dation was observed in the existence of a dextrose and acetate co-substrate. Using a
dextrose co-substrate, 98.5% degradation of HMX was accomplished in 7 days of treatment
time while decreased HMX degradation was recorded when sodium nitrate was used as
the co-substrate.
The effectiveness of Bacillus aryabhattai in the biotransformation of HMX was studied
in [26]. The tolerance of Bacillus aryabhattai against HMX was found to be very high. It was
demonstrated that HMX biotransformation takes place outside the bacterial cell. However,
in presence of HMX, there was a metabolic imbalance in cells for lipids and lipid-like
molecules. Bacillus aryabhattai inoculation led to a 90.5% removal of HMX within 24 h
for 5 mg L 1of HMX concentration. FTIR analysis showed the presence of the ‚ÄìOH
functional group on the bacterial cell surface. HMX biotransformation in the presence of
an enzyme was also explored [ 9]. Xanthine oxidase was utilized as a catalyst for HMX
biotransformation, and it was observed that anaerobic conditions were more effective in
comparison to aerobic conditions, and the biotransformation rate in anaerobic conditions
was recorded to be 10.5 0.9 nmol h 1mg protein 1.
Furthermore, the biodegradation of HMX was investigated in different electron-
acceptor conditions [ 7]. The sewage treatment plant‚Äôs based anaerobic digester was utilized
for the development of culture. HMX biodegradation was tested under different conditions,
viz., mixed electron-accepting conditions, methanogenic, fermenting, sulfate-reducing, and
nitrate-reducing conditions. Methanol and chloroform were the end-products of HMX
biodegradation when the mixed electron-acceptor conditions were used. A reductive path-
way for HMX treatment using organic mulch (microorganism consortium) as an electron
donor was also investigated [ 17]. In the column study with 8 ppb inÔ¨Çuent HMX, complete
removal was recorded. Mulch and compost introduced to aquifers can establish an anaero-
bic environment and act as an electron donor, supporting the conversion of electrophilic
contaminants via reductive pathways. Mulch is a low-cost naturally available electron
donor which surpassed other viable options. When HMX-contaminated wastewater Ô¨Çows
via in situ mulch PRB, it works like a slow-release source for soluble carbon electron donors
which improves the HMX biodegradation.

Bioaugmentation is an effective approach for in situ remediations of contaminated
soil. Eco-friendly carriers for the immobilization of microbes have a signiÔ¨Åcant impact
as they protect the microbes from undesirable pH conditions and the presence of haz-
ardous compounds. The bioaugmentation approach was tested for the abatement of
HMX-contaminated soil [ 8]. For this study, a mixture of coca peat and calcite was used for
the immobilization of the soil bacterium ‚Äú Janibacter cremeus ‚Äù. Under aerobic and anoxic
conditions, HMX was degraded in 35 days. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis conÔ¨Årmed
the presence of nitroso derivatives from the anoxic degradation of HMX. Two different
pathways, viz., (a) two-electron reduction pathways [ 51] and (b) denitraion pathway [ 1],
were proposed for HMX degradation.
The potential of the bacterial strain, Bacillus toyonensis on the HMX contaminated site
was tested for HMX degradation in an aqueous medium [ 31]. Response surface method-
ology was chosen for the experimental design in this study. Parameters, viz., microbial
inoculum size, degradation time, and HMX initial concentrations, were optimized. For
2 mg/L HMX, 87.7% degradation was recorded in 15 days. The determination of nitrite and
nitrate concentrations conÔ¨Årms the HMX degradation. Anaerobic oligotrophic conditions
for the biodegradation of HMX in cold marine sediment were also evaluated [ 85]. For a
1.2 mg/L HMX concentration, it took 50 days for a 50% reduction in HMX concentration.
Improved HMX removal was noted with the availability of glucose as a carbon source. The
potential of soil bacteria available in the contaminated site was used for the HMX removal
from soil samples [ 15]. In presence of molasses as a co-substrate, HMX was degraded by
soil bacteria via a co-metabolic process. A batch mode study showed that a 97% reduction
in HMX concentration was achieved in 4 months of reaction time.
The biological nitriÔ¨Åcation of alkaline hydrosylate of HMX and RDX was also exam-
ined [ 86]. A denitrifying (anoxic) packed bed upÔ¨Çow reactor was used for the alkaline
hydrosylate treatment of HMX which generated acetate, formate, formaldehyde, and nitrite.
Within 3 h of retention time, 90% removal of organic compounds and nitrite from hydrosy-
late was ascertained. Denitrifying bacterial isolates of Pseudomonas (HPB1) and Bacillus
(HPB2 and HPB3) were tested for HMX biodegradation [ 77]. The efÔ¨Çuent for this study
was collected from an HMX production plant. The wastewater characterization showed
the presence of CH 3COOH, NH 4NO 3, explosive residue, and other organic nitro bodies.
HMX was efÔ¨Åciently degraded by the isolate HPB1. The HPB2 performed admirably in
HMX-containing efÔ¨Çuent when neutralized with NaHCO 3,while samples neutralized with
ammonia were not suitable for biotransformation and resulted in a lower degradation
of HMX. However, denitrifying HPB1 was effective in the nitrate reduction for both the
neutralizing agents.
The treatment of explosives-contaminated aquifer slurries was carried out using anaer-
obic biodegradation. For this purpose, C 2H5OH and propylene glycol were selected as
electron donors which ultimately support providing syntrophically produced H 2which
participates in the HMX degradation anaerobically [ 87]. The slurries of explosives con-
taminated groundwater and soil and were used for the construction of anoxic microcosms.
Enhanced biodegradation of HMX and other explosives was recorded when 5 mM C 2H5OH
and propylene glycol were used. C 2H5OH depletion produces H 2, CH 3COOH, and CH 4in
20 days while propylene glycol produces H 2,CH 3COOH, and propionate as end-products
after 15 days of degradation time. The presence of ethanol and propylene glycol in slurries
provides H 2which enhances the biodegradation of HMX in the explosive-contaminated soil.
Further, for anaerobic HMX degradation, the performance of ruminal microorganisms
from whole rumen Ô¨Çuid (WRF), and 23 commercially available ruminal strains was exam-
ined [ 88]. It was observed that in 24 h of degradation time, the concentration of HMX was
reduced from 30 M to 5 M HMX. In HMX degradation, Ô¨Årstly nitroso or hydroxylamino
intermediates were formed by HMX reduction followed by enzymatic ring cleavage to
other byproducts. The HMX degradation ability to metabolize the bacteria of two unex-
ploded ordnance (UXO) disposal sites (UXO-3 and UXO-5) and one reference site (midref)
sediment was investigated [ 73]. Two different groups of bacteria (group I- Aerotolerant
Downloaded from mostwiedzy.plInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 15948 13 of 21
anaerobes and microaerophiles and group II facultative anaerobes) were conÔ¨Årmed in the
UXO-5 sample by 16S rRNA sequencing. Anaerobic bacteria (group III and group IV) were
available in UXO-3 and midref sediments samples. Bacteria species in different groups
were as follows: group I- phylogenetic cluster of Clostridiales; group II- Paenibacillus;
group III- Tepidibacter of Firmicutes; and group IV- Desulfovibrio of Deltaproteobacteria.
It was observed that approximately 26.8% of HMX was mineralized by group IV bacteria
in 308 days while other bacteria from other groups gave negligible mineralization.
Phytoremediation
Phytoremediation is environmentally friendly, economically viable, and a feasible
alternative for the removal of explosives and is an acknowledged method used for envi-
ronmental remediation [ 12,24,89]. The phytoremediation approach includes the utilization
of green plants for the remediation of water and soil. Plant enzymes play a vital role in
the oxidation/reduction of pollutants [ 89,90]. The uptake and biotransformation of pol-
lutants in phytoremediation can be differentiated as phytoextraction, phytovolatilization,
phytodegradation, rhizoÔ¨Åltration, and phytostabilization [ 91,92]. Usually, explosives are en-
vironmentally stable and resistant to remediation. HMX is less vulnerable to plant uptake in
comparison to other explosives [ 28]. Various factors such as HMX concentration, ionization
constant, pH of sample solutions, organic matter content, and plant physiology affect the
phytoremediation of HMX [ 12]. A long remediation process time makes phytoremediation
a time-consuming approach [12,91].
HMX uptake by hybrid poplar trees was demonstrated and various parameters for
HMX uptake were investigated [ 11]. The HMX uptake in hybrid poplar trees was achieved
through hydroponic solutions. It was observed that HMX uptake did not show any toxic
effect on hybrid poplar cuttings. For HMX uptake conÔ¨Årmation, radiolabeled [U-14C]
HMX was utilized. Further, in another study, Myriophyllum aquaticum and axenic hairy
root cultures of Catharanthus roseus were used for HMX uptake [ 93]. The exposure level for
HMX was set as 5 mg/L. Additionally, Methylobacterium sp. (strain BJ001) extracted from
hybrid poplar tissues (Populus deltoides X nigra DN34) was applied for HMX degradation
and it was reported that the Methylobacterium sp. was efÔ¨Åcient in the transformation of
2.5 mg/L of [U-14C]HMX within 40 days [ 35]. Further, soil from an anti-tank Ô¨Åring range
was utilized for growing indigenous terrestrial and some agricultural plants which were
then utilized for the HMX degradation [28].
The potential of alfalfa ( Medicago sativa ) for explosive biodegradation was investigated
and it was reported that HMX can be degraded by hydrolase secreted by alfalfa [ 75]. The
degradation rate for HMX by alfalfa was 18.4% under hydroponic conditions. It has been
reported that Methylobacterium populum sp. nov., strain BJ001 can degrade HMX and
other explosives compounds efÔ¨Åciently [ 76]. Because autotroph plants lack enzymatic mech-
anisms to effectively metabolize organic contaminants, the phytoremediation approach
is typically slow and incomplete [ 12]. In genetically modiÔ¨Åed plant species (transgenic
plants), the potential of bacterial genes to degrade organic pollutants is integrated with
the plants‚Äô phytoremediation advantages. In recent years, the biodegradation of explo-
sives using transgenic plants has sparked great attention due to their higher efÔ¨Åciency
and tolerance towards explosives [ 89]. The introduction of bacterial genes, for example,
nitroreductase and cytochrome P450, into plants can enhance the tolerance level of plants
and degradation performance [ 12]. Phytoremediation could be a promising approach in
the treatment of explosive-contaminated wastewater/soil and more exploration is needed
for further development in transgenic plants.
3. Byproducts/End-Products of HMX Degradation Via Different
Treatment Approaches
It is clear from the discussion of physicochemical and bioremediation approaches
that the degradation pathway is highly dependent on the treatment approach and process
parameters [ 94‚Äì97]. The intermediate/end-products of HMX degradation in various re-

mediation methods are shown in Table 4. It is clear from this table that NO 3 , NO 2 , and
NH 4+are found in the majority of the investigations, raising the possibility that secondary
treatment may be required to avoid releasing these species into the environment.

Owing to their ever-increasing demand and a continual increase in production, HMX
and other energetic materials have led to environmental pollution [ 3,73,75]. Due to envi-
ronmental legislation and the toxicity of these contaminants, there is a growing need for
the development of a sustainable approach for their removal from contaminated soil and
wastewater/groundwater [ 6,30]. HMX has been effectively removed from the contami-
nated soil and wastewater by various approaches. However, these approaches have some
advantages as well as disadvantages that need to be taken into consideration during the
selection of any treatment tool for the remediation of HMX-contaminated soil or wastewater
(Table 5) .

The advantages of physicochemical methods include their fast treatment speed and
wide applicability on the wider range of HMX concentrations in soil/groundwater/
wastewater, and, so far, they have become the preferable methods for the remediation
of HMX. Incineration is a very effective treatment approach, but it is associated with high
energy consumption. Additionally, incineration can cause NO xemissions and affect soil fer-
tility. Furthermore, incineration is an expensive treatment method for HMX abatement [ 20].
Adsorption is an effective approach for HMX removal; however, it results in the separation
of pollutants rather than their destruction. Chemical reduction and advanced oxidation
processes (AOPs) are effective in terms of degradation, but during treatment, the genera-
tion of toxic byproducts usually requires secondary treatment [ 102]. Some conventional
treatment approaches are energy-intensive and not economically viable and are associated
with the generation of toxic end-products [2,27,30].
The biological method for the removal of hazardous pollutants such as explosive
wastes has been increasing in demand resulting in the exploitation of the potential of various
microorganisms and plant species [ 74]. Owing to the low-cost and environmentally friendly
processes, the biological treatment approach is very promising for the remediation of HMX-
contaminated soil and water [ 26]. In the biological approach, microorganisms utilize
explosives as their nitrogen source, but it is time-consuming [ 74]. In some cases, microbial
consortiums are not very tolerant to explosives and can be inactivated by toxic pollutants.
Phytoremediation is another environmentally friendly approach and has many advan-
tages over other technologies [ 74]. Explosives can be mineralized using phytoremediation.
Downloaded from mostwiedzy.plInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 15948 16 of 21
It was reported that the cost for phytoremediation of explosive contaminants is half that
compared to any other treatment approach. The cost for soil remediation using phytore-
mediation was estimated at $25‚Äì$100/ton while the cost estimated for the treatment of
wastewater has been reported as $0.60‚Äì$6.00/1000 gallons of wastewater [ 91]. However,
phytoremediation requires a longer time for growing plants [ 26]. As plant species and
plant growth are very much dependent on the climate and geological conditions, it is very
much limited for a particular site. Further, HMX and byproducts of HMX may accumulate
in the plant and may thus persist in the environment.
5. Challenges
The role of Octahydro-1, 3, 5, 7-tetranitro-1, 3, 5, 7-tetrazocine (HMX) in different Ô¨Åelds
is well recognized. Due to the extensive applications of HMX, different concentrations of
HMX are found in soil, groundwater, and wastewater. Because of its recalcitrant nature,
HMX can sustain itself in the environment for a long period. Diverse approaches to HMX
mineralization, such as AOPs or bioremediation, typically produce nitrate, nitrite, and
ammonium. There is a serious environmental issue associated with these end-products
which demand removal, typically via biological treatment processes. Such combinations of
processes should be studied together. On the other hand, after AOPs, there is a risk of the
formation of disparate nitro-products due to reactive nitrogen species, and the possibility
of a reaction of nitrogen species with other byproducts or residual parent products; thus,
undesired toxic end-products can be formed. Therefore, meticulous monitoring of these
end-products is critical, and appropriate abatement should be considered for secondary
treatment to avoid the discharge of nitro-products. The degradation pathway and in-
termediates of explosive contaminants need to be thoroughly understood. In terms of
AOPs, several very effective approaches were still not applied for HMX degradation. This
relates to cavitation-based AOPs which proved synergism in the case of the removal of
many groups of organic compounds [ 103]. A comparable research gap exists concerning
sulfate radical-based AOPs (SR-AOPs) which have already been proven to be effective and
sustainable oxidants [ 96,97]. On the other hand, HMX bioremediation approaches such as
aerobic/anaerobic degradation and phytoremediation are environmentally friendly, but
these treatments require a long time. Additionally, microbial species/plant species are
sensitive and need careful assessment.
6. Conclusions
The application of HMX in different Ô¨Åelds is unavoidable, hence its proper treatment
is the only solution for a safe environment. There is a growing concern about developing
new, cutting-edge, and sophisticated technologies for HMX remediation. Technologies
such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), reduction, incineration, adsorption, etc.
have been investigated by many scientiÔ¨Åc researchers and found to be effective in HMX
treatment. However, most of the technologies are associated with a high-cost factor and
additional environmental problems. Further, the development of sustainable materials
for HMX abatement is complicated. Owing to the pH-dependent surface charge of photo-
catalysts/adsorbents, the selection of efÔ¨Åcient photo-catalysts/adsorbents is challenging.
Although sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes have turned out to be
remarkably efÔ¨Åcient in the mineralization of a variety of organic pollutants, their appropri-
ateness for HMX treatment has not been adequately scrutinized. Bioremediation for HMX
treatment has gained momentum in the past few years; however, the uptake mechanism
and effect of reaction intermediates/byproducts on microbial species/plant species still
need better understanding. In recent years, researchers have explored the possibilities
of transgenic plants for the abatement of HMX which can enhance the treatment time
and mineralization issues. However, there are many hurdles related to the transgenic
plant-based remediation approach that needs to be explored. Finally, from an industrial
point of view, more initiatives are required to explore simpliÔ¨Åed, reliable, and cost-effective
strategies for HMX abatement in a safer manner. The integration of different techniques in

a series as a pre-or post-treatment can facilitate the high removal and full mineralization of
HMX. Despite the remarkable developments in recent years, some obstacles remaining in
HMX treatment technologies must be resolved to make the HMX treatment approach safer,
more effective, and sustainable.
