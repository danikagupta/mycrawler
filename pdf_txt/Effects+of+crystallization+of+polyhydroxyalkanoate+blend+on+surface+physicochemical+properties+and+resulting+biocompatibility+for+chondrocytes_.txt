Abstract
Development and selection of an ideal scaffold is of importance for tissue engineering. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-
hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) is a biocompatible bioresorbable copolymer that belongs to the polyhydroxyalkanoate family.
Because of its good biocompatibility, PHBHHx has been widely used as a cell scaffold for tissue engineering. This review
focuses on the utilization of PHBHHx-based scaffolds in tissue engineering. Advances in the preparation, modification, and
application of PHBHHx scaffolds are discussed.
Key words: PHBHHx; Tissue engineering; Biomaterial
Introduction
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate)
(PHBHHx) is a natural biological polyester material that
belongs to the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family (1,2).
Compared with other, well-established PHA family mem-
bers, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and poly(3-hydroxy-
butyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), PHBHHx has
better biodegradability and mechanical properties.
PHBHHx has excellent biocompatibility with a variety of
cell types, including smooth muscle cells (3), fibroblasts
(4), articular cartilage-derived chondrocytes (5,6), osteo-
blasts (7), and bone marrow cells (8). Additionally,
PHBHHx possesses a low degree of crystallinity (2).
Polyhydoxyalkanoates are generally biodegradable
and thermoprocessable and thus have been widely used
in both conventional medical devices and tissue engineer-
ing. Because of its good biocompatibility, PHBHHx is
attracting increasing attention as a cell scaffold for tissue
engineering (2). Ye et al. (9) demonstrated that a three-
dimensional PHB/PHBHHx scaffold seeded with differ-
entiated human adipose-derived stem cells is capable of
producing cartilage-like tissue after implantation into the
subcutaneous layer of nude mice. PHBHHx scaffolds
have been successfully applied in an in vivo tendon repair
model, as evidenced by facilitation of tendon movement
recovery and complete restoration of load bearing and
function in recipient rats (10).This review describes the two- and three-dimensional
properties of PHBHHx and focuses on the improvement of
its biological properties via surface modifications. Recent
advances in the preparation and application of PHBHHx
scaffolds are also discussed.
Scaffolds
Development and selection of a suitable scaffold is a
critical aspect of tissue engineering. Scaffolds act not only
as a physical support, but also as an artificial extracellular
matrix (ECM) that contributes to the attachment, prolif-
eration, and differentiation of seeded cells (11). An ideal
scaffold material should meet the following criteria
(12,13): 1) nontoxicity of the polymer and its degradation
products, 2) excellent biocompatibility with seeded cells,
3) good mechanical properties and flexibility, 4) controlled
biodegradability, 5) easily formed as a porous structure,
and6) appropriate thermoplastic properties.
Tissue engineering scaffolds can be roughly divided into
natural and synthetic scaffolds. Synthetic scaffolds such
as polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid (PLA) have been
widely used as medical sutures, stents, and drug delivery
carriers (14,15). Natural polymers including collagen, fibrin,
chitosan, and PHAs are biocompatible and yield promising
results when used as tissue engineering scaffolds (16-18).

ISSN 1414-431X Review
www.bjournal.com.br Braz J Med Biol Res 00(00) 2014Properties of PHBHHx scaffolds
Physical properties . Chen et al. (2) suggest that the
changing PHA compositions allow favorable mechanical
properties, biocompatibility, and degradation times within
desirable time frames under specific physiological con-
ditions (Table 1). From this table, we find that the melting
temperature (T m) and glass-transition temperature (T g)
of PHBHHx are dependent on the content of 3-hydrox-
yhexanoate (HHx), i.e., the higher the proportion of HHx,
the lower the T mand T gvalues. Crystallinity of PHBHHx
also decreases with increase in the content of HHx. In the
composite system of PHB/PHBHHx, similar findings are
observed. Chen et al. (2) also revealed that PHB/
PHBHHx blended at a ratio of 1:1 has the maximum
surface free energy, a key parameter affecting adhesion,
distribution, and differentiation of seeded cells (2,19).
Toxicity of PHBHHx and its degradation products .
PHBHHx is a copolyester of 3-hydroxybutyrate (HB) and
HHx. PHB is not only an inert storage polymer found in the
cytoplasm of many bacteria, but also a universal,
interactive, solvating biopolymer involved in important
physiological functions (20). Martin et al. (21) reported
that, as the degradation products of PHBHHx, neither HB
nor HHx are toxic, and even provide some therapeutic
or nutritional benefits. It has been documented that HB
facilitates neuronal survival and differentiation.
In vitro and in vivo PHBHHx biodegradation . Chen and
Tong (22) evaluated, for the first time, the biodegradability
of PHBHHx films vsPHB and Ecoflex and examined the
effect of HHx content on PHBHHx degradation. They
reported that, after 18 days of incubation, 40% P(HB-co-
12%-HHx) and 20% PHB were degraded, while Ecoflex
only lost 5% of its weight. Compared with PHB, P(HB-co-
5%-HHx), and P(HB-co-20%-HHx), P(HB-co-12%-HHx)
was degraded at a faster rate. Scanning electron
microscopy analysis revealed that P(HB-co-12%-HHx)
films had the most porous surface after degradation.
These findings indicate that surface morphology plays an
important role in the degradation of PHBHHx. P(HB-co-
12%-HHx), with a low crystallinity and rough surface, had
the highest degradation rate.In vivo studies of PHBHHx and a PHBHHx/polyethyl-
ene glycol (PEG) blend implanted in rabbits for 6 months
found that PHBHHx decreased in weight faster than PHB
but slower than PLA (3,19). The degradation of PHBHHx
was greatly improved by blending with PEG, but such
blends led to a strong tissue response. Therefore,
PHBHHx is a good biodegradable material and may be
suitable for in vivo applications.
Biocompatibility properties . It has been reported that
mouse fibroblast L929 cells plated on PHB/PHBHHx films
grew better than those plated on PHB and PLA films,
suggesting the PHB/PHBHHx blend is highly biocom-
patible (23). Similarly, Zhao et al. (24) demonstrated that
chondrocyte cells grown on PHBHHx/PHB scaffolds
possessed the physiological functions needed for
effective cartilage tissue regeneration. However, the
biocompatibility of PHAs is inadequate because of their
hydrophobic properties (23). These findings suggest that
improvement of the biocompatibility of PHBHHx is pivotal
for its applications in tissue engineering. The methods
commonly used to improve the biocompatibility of materials
are discussed in detail in the third section of this review
(Surface modification of PHBHHx for improved biocom-
patibility).
PHA family members for tissue engineering
applications
PHAs
PHAs are a family of biodegradable polyesters
synthesized by bacteria as intracellular carbon and
energy storage compounds (2). More than 150 kinds of
monomeric PHAs have been reported. Although PHAs
have the potential to be used as tissue engineering
biomaterials, only a few of them, such as PHB, PHBV,
and PHBHHx, have been produced industrially (25). PHB
is one of the most thoroughly researched members of the
PHA family and has good biocompatibility for adrenocor-
tical cells, osteoblasts, epithelial cells, fibroblasts,
endothelium cells, and isolated hepatocytes (26).
However, it is highly brittle and degrades slowly, and

Braz J Med Biol Res 00(00) 2014 www.bjournal.com.brboth of these properties have limited its applications (27).
Another PHA family member, PHBV, can be produced as
fibers that have been shown to promote reepithelialization
(28). After surface modification, PHB and PHBV are able
to promote osseointegration (29). However, long-term
exposure to PHB and PHBV may induce an inflammatory
response.
Brief introduction of PHBHHx
The new PHA family member, PHBHHx, is considered a
very promising tissue engineering material with adjustable
mechanical properties and good biocompatibility and
biodegradability (3). Experimental studies have indicated
that PHBHHx has high biocompatibility for a wide range of
cell types such as smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts,
chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and bone marrow cells (5,30-
33). The PHBHHx films were created using solvent-casting,
electrospinning, and compression molding methods, and
the behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)
grown on these films has been investigated (34). hMSCs
cultured on highly porous electrospun PHBHHx films have
better cell viability than those cultured on compression-
molded films.
PHBHHx particles have been used as drug delivery
systems in targeted anticancer therapy (35-37). PHBHHx
combined with folic acid and loaded with etoposide (a cell
cycle-specific anticancer drug) allows improvement of the
targeted delivery of drugs to tumors. In another applica-
tion, PHBHHx nanoparticles loaded with an insulin-
phospholipid complex have been used in a long-acting
release formulation of insulin. However, practical applica-
tions of PHBHHx have been limited because of some
disadvantages such as high hydrophobicity and low
crystallization rate. To overcome these limitations, many
attempts have been made to modify the physicochemical
properties of PHBHHx and to develop new formulations.
Surface modification of PHBHHx for
improved biocompatibility
Surface treatment
Surface modification is an effective way to improve the
hydrophilic properties of PHAs. Different strategies,
including ultraviolet treatment, plasma treatment, grafting
techniques, and surface hydrolysis (38-40), have been
applied to increase the hydrophilicity of polymer materials.
These treatments can be used not only to increase the
hydrophilicity of the surface material, but also to introduce
biologically active molecules to polymer surfaces, thus
modifying the biocompatibility of materials. Alkali and
lipase treatments are very effective to improve the wetting
and adhesion properties of polymer surfaces (32,41). It
has been demonstrated that NaOH treatment enhances
the attachment of cells to PHBHHx films (42). However,
these surface modification techniques do have some
disadvantages. For example, grafting makes the surfaceof the material very unstable because of the very weak
interaction between the bulk polymer and the bioactive
molecules. Direct ultraviolet radiation may change the
mechanical properties of polymer films and make them
very brittle. Plasma treatment may only temporarily
enhance the hydrophilicity of PHAs.
Blending with other materials
The blending of materials with different properties is a
commonly used approach to offset individual defects. Mei
et al. (43) evaluated the biocompatibility of PHBHHx
modified by silk fibroin (SF). They found that the water
contact angle on the PHBHHx/SF was smaller than that
on the pure PHBHHx scaffold, and the number of cells
attached to the surface of PHBHHx/SF films was larger
than on the control films, indicating an improvement in
hydrophilicity and biocompatibility.
Additionally, PHA family members may be blended with
each other. Scaffolds made from PHBHHx and PHB at a
ratio of 1:1 have a higher surface free energy and are more
effective for chondrocyte adhesion than scaffolds made of
PHBHHx alone (19). In another study, adipose-derived
mesenchymal stem cells inoculated on PHB/PHBHHx
scaffolds and implanted into animals were found to generate
cartilage-like tissues 14 days after implantation (2).
Biomodification with amphiphilic proteins
Recently, biomodification of polymer surfaces has
emerged as a novel approach to improve their wetting and
adhesion properties. Several amphiphilic proteins have been
identified to be located on the surface of in vivo PHA granules
including PhaC synthase, poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate depol-
ymerase (PhaZ), and granule-associated protein (PhaP)
(44). Previous studies showed that PhaP fusion proteins are
able to bind to natural PHA granules, allowing for the
development of low-cost approaches for protein purification,
specific drug delivery, and cell sorting. Arginine-glycine-
aspartate (RGD) tripeptide is normally involved in cell binding
to a number of ECM glycoproteins by interaction with
integrins (45). The PhaP-RGD fusion protein, when used to
coat PHBHHx, has been shown to enhance cell adhesion,
spreading, migration, and proliferation (31). Similarly, You et
al. (5) showed that PhaP-RGD-coated PHBHHx scaffolds
facilitate chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells inoculated onto them.
Scaffold fabrication
There are currently several methods available for
fabrication of PHBHHx scaffolds, including solution casting,
electrospinning, phase separation, solvent casting, fiber
bonding and particulate leaching, solid freeform fabrication,
and particle sintering (46,47).
Solvent evaporation method
Solvent evaporation is a simple method and the mostPHBHHx-based scaffolds for tissue engineering 3
www.bjournal.com.br Braz J Med Biol Res 00(00) 2014commonly used to fabricate PHBHHx films (34). In detail,
a PHBHHx solution is prepared by dissolving purified
PHBHHx in chloroform, which is then evenly distributed
into glass dishes. The chloroform is allowed to evaporate
at room temperature, resulting in the formation of
PHBHHx films on the Petri dishes. Vacuum drying is
generally applied to eliminate the residual solvent,
because of its cytotoxicity.
Phase separation and freeze-drying
Freeze-drying is commonly used to prepare three-
dimensional scaffolds (33). The principle involved is that
the polymer solution, emulsion, or hydrogel is frozen to
induce phase separation, and the solvent is then removed
by vacuum freeze-drying to form a porous scaffold. The
pore morphology, mechanical properties, biocompatibility,
and degradability of the scaffold are affected by the
concentration of the polymer solution and the phase
separation temperature, the quenching temperature, and
the types of polymer and solvent.
Wang et al. (48) fabricated PHBHHx scaffolds by
thermally induced phase separation. In this process,
polymers are dissolved in 1,4-dioxane under vigorous
agitation for 60 min at 65 6C and the mixture is then kept
frozen at – –806C for 2 h. After removal of the solvent via
freeze-drying, porous scaffolds are obtained, with a pore
size of approximately 60-100 mm in diameter and a porosity
of 93±1.4%. Such porous three-dimensional scaffolds
provide additional space for seeded cells to grow.
Electrospinning techniques
Electrospinning techniques have been used to create
fibrous scaffolds that mimic the natural ECM for study of in
vivo-like phenotypic shape and gene expression (49).
Interestingly, the orientation of electrospun fibers is able
to provide contact guidance for the attached cells, and
has an impact on their morphology and even their
differentiation capacity. It has been reported that aligned
electrospun fibers promote Schwann cell maturation,
neurite outgrowth, vascular endothelial cell growth, and
myotube formation (6). The regular alignment of fibers
leads to enhanced osteogenic responses in MSCs
compared with the fibers having a randomly networked
architecture.
The application of electrospinning techniques in tissue
engineering has been reviewed (50). Three-dimensional
fibrous and nanofibrous PHBHHx-based scaffolds that
have been successfully produced by electrospinning show
an osteoinductive potential. However, it is difficult to control
the porosity of scaffolds produced using this technique.
Particle leaching
Highly porous scaffolds can be fabricated by particle
leaching using sodium chloride (NaCl) particles as a
porogen (51). Sun et al. (51) demonstrated that the
porosity of scaffolds is almost independent of the porogensize, but instead is dependent on the amount of porogen.
The maximum porosity of scaffolds can reach about 85%,
when the weight ratio of porogen to polymers is 9:1. The
fabrication process began with dissolving 2 g PHBHHx
powder in 20 mL chloroform in a 50-mL conical flask and
then 0.04 g NaCl crystals was suspended in the PHBHHx-
chloroform solution and mixed by shaking. Tube con-
struction was carried out using a 2.5-mm diameter
stainless steel mandrill, which was dipped into the
homogenized PHBHHx/NaCl solution for 1 s, followed
by solvent evaporation in a flow hood for 2 min. This
process was repeated five times, after which the mandrill
was fixed vertically for 60 min to allow the solvent to fully
evaporate and the polymer to become rigid. The polymer
tube was carefully removed by hand and immersed in
deionized H 2O overnight to introduce porosity through
NaCl crystal dissolution.
Applications of PHBHHx-based
biopolyesters
In recent years, PHBHHx-based biopolyesters have
been developed for various potential medical applications,
especially as tissue engineering and drug delivery
materials.
PHBHHx as a material for bone and cartilage tissue
engineering
Cells for bone and cartilage regeneration have been
evaluated for their proliferative and differentiative
responses when inoculated into PHBHHx-based scaffolds
(32,52). It has been reported that PHBHHx scaffolds
increase both chondrocyte proliferation and protein
secretion in rabbit articular cartilage cells seeded onto
them (53). Chondrocyte proliferation and synthesis of
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and type II collagen are
generally required for successful cartilage regeneration.
Compared to those seeded on PLA and PHB, rabbit
bone marrow cells inoculated o n three-dimensional PHBHHx
scaffolds show more differentiation into osteoblast-like cells,
with a round cell shape, high alkaline phosphatase activity,
strong calcium deposition, and fibrillar collagen synthesis.
This finding suggests that PHBHHx is a suitable biomaterial
for promotion of osteoblast attachment, proliferation, and
differentiation.
Chondrocytes isolated from rabbit articular cartilage
were inoculated onto numerous PHBHHx/PHB porous
scaffolds (54). Total collagen content in all scaffolds
containing PHBHHx increased with the duration of
incubation. Moreover, the use of PHB/PHBHHx at a ratio
of 1:2 in scaffolds resulted in a significant increase in the
production of GAG, a major composition of ECM, after 7
days of culture, compared with scaffolds having different
component ratios. Therefore, the proportion of PHBHHx
in the PHB/PHBHHx composite system is of importance
for the promotion of ECM synthesis by articular cartilage4 H.M. Chang et al.
Braz J Med Biol Res 00(00) 2014 www.bjournal.com.brchondrocytes. The inoculated cells grew better on the
scaffolds consisting of PHBHHx/PHB at the ratios of 2:1
and 1:2 than on those having a 1:1 ratio.
Nerve and brain tissue repair
PHAs have shown good potential as medical implant
biomaterials. Neural stem cells (NSCs) grown on/in PHA
scaffolds may be useful for repairing central nervous
system (CNS) injury (46 ). Among the PHA family
members, PHBHHx appears to have the strongest
potential to promote NSC differentiation into neurons. It
has been suggested that PHBHHx nanofiber scaffolds
that promote NSC growth and differentiation could be
developed for treating CNS defects.
Porous nerve conduits with either uniform or nonuni-
form wall porosity were prepared using a particle leaching
method. The conduits were used to bridge a 10-mm
defect in the sciatic nerve of rats (55). PHBHHx nerve
conduits prepared in this study showed satisfactory
mechanical strength and biodegradability. Histological
assessment together with transmission electron micros-
copy showed that the performance of conduits with
nonuniform wall porosity was similar to that of nerve
autografts in promoting functional recovery, but better
than the conduits with uniform wall porosity. Thus,
PHBHHx-based conduits may represent a promising
alternative for peripheral nerve damage repair.
Soft tissue repair and smooth muscle engineering
Considering that its strength and elastic properties can
be adjusted by changing its monomer contents, PHBHHx
could be tailored to meet the requirements for regenerat-
ing both bone and soft tissues. PHBHHx, with its excellent
mechanical and thermal properties, has been used as a
scaffold for tissue-engineered cardiovascular products
(19). Qu et al. (56) prepared and modified PHBHHx by
ammonia-plasma treatment and fibronectin coating and
then inoculated human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) and rabbit aorta smooth muscle cells on the
surface of the modified PHBHHx scaffold (PFn-PHBHHx).
They found that HUVECs proliferated more on thePFn-PHBHHx than the PHBHHx surface and formed a
confluent monolayer 3 days after seeding. This finding
suggests that PFn-PHBHHx may be a good material as a
luminal surface of vascular grafts.
Due to good elasticity and strength, PHBHHx may be
a promising candidate material for the generation of
artificial esophagus. Indeed, some studies using PHBHHx
as artificial esophagus in dogs indicated that PHBHHx can
stimulate regeneration of removed esophagus tissue (2).
PHBHHx as biodegradable drug carriers
PHBHHx particles have been used for drug delivery
because of their biodegradability and nontoxic, nonimmu-
nogenic degradation products. For example, PHBHHx
nanoparticles and micron particles were used as drug
delivery carriers for the controlled release of 5-fluorouracil
(57). In combination with folic acid, PHBHHx nanoparti-
cles have been used to deliver etoposide, a cell cycle
specific anticancer drug, to tumors (58). Insulin phospho-
lipid complex loaded biodegradable PHBHHx nanoparti-
cles are effective in the delivery of long-acting insulin (58).
Conclusions
PHBHHx offers great practical potential as a tissue
engineering scaffold material. Numerous production
techniques are available to modify or improve the
physicochemical and biocompatible properties of
PHBHHx. With novel composite material generation
coupled with technical innovations, PHBHHx-based scaf-
folds may be of clinical benefit in regenerating a variety of
tissues.
