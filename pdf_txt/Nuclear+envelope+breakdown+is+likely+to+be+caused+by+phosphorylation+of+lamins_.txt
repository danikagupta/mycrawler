2001). FRAP of lamin B1 performed on both the upperand lower nuclear surface 5–10 min before NEBDshowed that lamin B1 did not recover any fluorescence,showing that the turnover of the lamin B1 was not in-creased (Figures 1E and 1I). FRAP in prophase cells wasthen applied to measure exchange from binding sitesfor LBR, LAP2 /H9252, and POM121, all of which are known
to be strongly immobilized in interphase nuclei (Ellen-berg et al., 1997; Rolls et al., 1999; Daigle et al., 2001).As in the 4D imaging experiments, the behavior of LAP2 /H9252
and POM121 was indistinguishable from that of laminB1 in that they did not show any recovery of fluores-cence prior to NEBD (Supplemental Figures S2C, S2D,S2G, and S2H). Only LBR quickly recovered fluores-cence in prophase with a t
1/2of/H1160130 s (Supplemental

tions before NEBD and the tearing event that permeabil-
ized the nucleus. Dynein attached to the NE is a likelycandidate to mediate microtubule-NE interactions at theG2/M transition, since it has been shown to localize tothe NE in prophase (Busson et al., 1998; Salina et al.,2002). Before NEBD, forces generated in the cytoplasmwere able to act on the nuclear lamina. The only knownNE structure that could transduce force between cyto-plasm and lamina is the immobile NPC (Daigle et al.,2001), which we speculate could serve as an attachmentsite for microtubules via dynein/dynactin (Salina et al.,2002). After NEBD, microtubules would remain attachedto NPCs in NE fragments on chromosomes and pullthem away from the chromosome surface toward thecentrosomes.
Mechanical Checkpoint or Clearing
of Kinetochores?If NEBD can occur in the absence of microtubules, whatthen is the function of NE tearing? In the absence ofmicrotubules, NEBD did occur—but by a different mech-anism where nuclear shrinking was followed by perme-abilization through many small holes that did not ex-pand. Mitotic phosphorylation cascades are thussufficient to drive the nucleus into disassembly evenwithout microtubules, but this route may miss an impor-tant regulatory component. Tearing of the NE by micro-tubules could be a means to couple spindle assemblyand NEBD in time. Only a reasonably developed spindlewould produce sufficient force to rupture the stable NEprotein network. This “mechanical checkpoint” would
prevent breakdown of the membrane compartment be-fore the microtubule-based spindle compartment has
