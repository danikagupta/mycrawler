Abstract: Eggshell, a waste material from food manufacturing, can be used as a potential ecofriendly
adsorbent for the elimination of textile dyes from water solutions. The adsorption process was
evaluated varying factors such as initial dye load, contact time, pH, quantity of adsorbent, and
temperature. The initial dye load (Direct Blue 78) was in the range of 25‚Äì300 mg /L. The kinetics of
adsorption were analyzed using di erent models, such as pseudo-Ô¨Årst-order, pseudo-second-order,
and intraparticle di usion model. Also, the experimental data at equilibrium were studied using
Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin isotherms. The kinetics followed pseudo-second-order, then
pseudo-Ô¨Årst-order, and Ô¨Ånally the model of intraparticle di usion. The results obtained for data
at equilibrium follow the order: Freundlich >Langmuir >Temkin. The adsorption equilibrium
showed a maximum capacity of adsorption (q max) of 13 mg /g at pH 5, and using 0.5 g of eggshell.
Dye adsorption was enhanced with increasing temperatures. The thermodynamic study revealed the
spontaneity and endothermic nature of the adsorption process. The desorption study shows that
the eggshell could be reused in di erent adsorption /desorption cycles. A novel advanced oxidation
process could degrade more than 95% of the dye. The results show that eggshell is a waste material
useful to remove hazardous dyes from wastewater, which may alleviate the environmental impact of
dyeing industries.

1. Introduction
Wastewater polluted with large amounts of dyes is usually dumped into aqueous e uents from
the food and plastic, leather, paper, printing, and textile industries [ 1]. Dyes have been widely used
in many industries for coloration purposes thanks to their good features, such as easy application,
low production cost, bright colour, and water-fastness [ 2]. Nowadays, more than 100,000 commercial
dyes exist with over 7 105tons of dyes produced per year, and approximately 10‚Äì15% are discharged
from textile industries [ 3]. Dyes are organic compounds that are classiÔ¨Åed according to the chemical
composition and type of application. Commercial dyes are categorized into three classes: cationic,
anionic, and nonionic, according to the charge after its dissolution in water. Azo compounds are the
most typical dyes used for industrial purposes [4‚Äì6].
Dyes are non-biodegradable, stable, oxidizing agents and are highly toxic and mutagenic to aquatic
life and humans [ 7]. Their discharge may produce severe hazard to aquatic living organisms, a ecting
Materials 2020 ,13, 1262; doi:10.3390 /ma13061262 www.mdpi.com /journal /materialsMaterials 2020 ,13, 1262 2 of 18
dierent processes of aquatic vegetation, decreasing the oxygen levels in water and resulting in the
choking of aquatic fauna and Ô¨Çora [ 8]. Thus, it is essential to reduce and remove organics pollutants from
wastewater before discharging them [ 9]. Various methods have been applied for the removal of harmful
contaminants from water and wastewater, involving adsorption on activated carbons, reverse osmosis,
chemical oxidation, membrane Ô¨Åltration, bacterial action, coagulation and Ô¨Çocculation, activated
sludge, ozonation, precipitation, electro-dialysis, ion exchange, and electrochemical techniques [ 10,11].
However, many of these methods are expensive and exhibit other drawbacks such as poor e ectiveness
and formation of sludge excess, and are thus unsuitable to be applied by small-scale industries [ 1].
Between them, adsorption is considered the most feasible method and has become one of the e ective
and easiest physico-chemical treatment procedures for the decolourization of textile wastewater. It
oers several advantages such as low initial costs, high e ciency, producing nontoxic intermediates
or by-products, high removal capability, versatility, easy handling, fast adsorption rate, and facile
separation [2,12].
The adsorption based on activated carbon is widely employed to remove dyes, however, it still
remains an expensive process owing to its high initial cost and the need for a regeneration system of the
adsorbent that make it less economically viable [ 8]. Recently, more e ective and cheaper adsorbents
based on by-products from poultry waste, agricultural waste, and other natural waste have been
developed as an alternative to conventional wastewater treatment processes [13].
In the last decades, researchers have been paying attention to the adsorption properties of
agricultural wastes to develop new biosorbents in accordance with circular economy principles. Some
alternatives include the orange peel, chitosan, eggshell, grape pomace, co ee residues, rice straw, olive
stones, banana peel, artichoke agrowaste, sugarcane bagasse, and bamboo shell, among others [ 14‚Äì24].
This waste, which is eco-friendly, economic renewable, and available in abundance, is a candidate for
the treatment of polluted water and wastewater [ 11]. Among the agricultural poultry by-products, the
waste generated can be a promising biosorbent that has slightly increased in recent years. Moreover,
the use of by-products from the agro-food sectors in the adsorption process helps to reduce the waste,
as well as the low cost biomasses acquisition [ 17]. Waste materials obtained from di erent sources
have been used as potential adsorbents for the removal of inorganic and organic pollutants. Eggshell
and eggshell membranes are waste materials produced in large amounts in the poultry and farms
industries as well as restaurants, bakeries, or homes [25].
Approximately 10% of the total mass of hen egg corresponds to eggshell by-product, with an
average weigh of 60 g, and it is usually discarded in landÔ¨Ålls without any pretreatment. In addition,
this waste is commonly reused as soil conditioner, fertilizer, or additive for animal feed. The eggshell
consists of three layers: the cuticle on the outer surface (mucin protein), the calciÔ¨Åed eggshell (calcite or
calcium carbonate crystals), and the eggshell membrane (protein Ô¨Åbers). Numerous pore channels are
distributed on the surface of eggshell (between 7000 and 17,000 pores), thus eliciting water transpiration
and gaseous exchanges. The porous nature of eggshell makes it a desirable material to be used as an
adsorbent [11,13].
Retention of contaminants by adsorbents is not 100% e cient; therefore, additional methods
are required to avoid non-retained dyes being disposed of into the environment. The degradation
of dyes by an advanced oxidation process (AOP), using pulsed light technology as a photolyzer of
hydrogen peroxide, is a novel, fast, and e cient version of AOPs that uses mercury-free lamps to
generate energy-dense light [26].
Thus, the main objective of this paper was to evaluate the potential use of eggshell to remove
Direct Blue 78 (DB78) dye in aqueous solution by adsorption, and to determine the e ect of di erent
parameters such as contact time, initial dye load, pH, and adsorbent concentration. The isotherms of
adsorption, as well as the kinetics of dye adsorption on the eggshell, were evaluated by Ô¨Åtting the
experimental data to di erent kinetics and isotherms models. Further, the e ciency of degradation of
DB78 by a novel AOP in order to minimize dye discharge to the environment was measured.Materials 2020 ,13, 1262 3 of 18
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials
Hen eggshells were purchased from a local organic farm. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), acetic acid
(C2H4O2), sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (H 4NaO 5P), hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), and
hydrochloric acid (HCl) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain) and boric acid (H 3BO3)
was purchased from Scharlau (Madrid, Spain). All of these chemicals were used to prepare dye
solutions at di erent pH values. Colorprint (Valencia, Spain) kindly provided Direct Blue 78 dye.
Deionized water was utilized to prepare all aqueous solutions throughout the experiments.
2.2. Eggshell Conditioning
Eggshells with their membrane were washed under tap water, dried at room temperature, and
stored at 35C in order to prevent the spoilage of the eggshell samples before using them. Before
using them, eggshells were ground in a sturdy vessel in which the material was pounded with a pestle
and sieved to obtain the required particle size (1‚Äì1.5 cm2). Thereafter, pieces of eggshell were used as
the adsorbent in the adsorption studies.
The major constituents of the eggshell are carbonates, sulphates and phosphates of calcium and
magnesium, and organic matter. Traces of Na, K, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Sr metals are also present in the
eggshell [ 27]. The density of the eggshell is about 2.53 g /cm3, which is signiÔ¨Åcantly larger than that
of eggshell membrane (1.358 g /cm3). The major constituents of the eggshell are calcium carbonate
(94%), organic matter (4%), calcium phosphate (1%), and magnesium carbonate (1%). The eggshell
membrane possesses nearly 60% protein (collagen (35%), glucosamine (10%), chondroitin (9%), and
hyaluronic acid (5%)), along with other inorganic components like Ca, Mg, Si, Zn, and so on in smaller
quantities [ 28]. The membrane surface bears positively charged sites produced by basic side chains of
amino acids. It has a very high surface area with special functional groups such as hydroxyl (  OH),
thiol ( SH), carboxyl ( COOH), amino ( NH 2), amide ( CONH 2), and so on, which strongly interact
with some chemical species present in the albumen.
2.3. Dye Solution Preparation
DB78 is an azo dye (CAS 2503-73-3) whose molecular weight is 1055.91 g /mol and whose formula
is C 42H25N7Na4O13S4. Aqueous solutions with di erent concentrations of dye (25, 50, 100, 150, 200,
250, and 300 mg /L) were prepared from a 1 g /L stock solution, and used to determine the capacity of
adsorption of the eggshell.
2.4. Analyses and Data Evaluation
The concentration of DB78 was measured at the wavelength of 612 nm, which is the maximum
absorbance of the dye [ 15]. A spectrophotometer was used to determine the absorbance before and
after the treatment (UV-1603, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
2.5. Adsorption Experiments
The adsorption experiments were conducted at di erent dye concentrations, ranging from 25 to
300 mg /L. The kinetic adsorption studies were performed at di erent doses of adsorbent, pH, and dye
concentrations. The e ect of contact time on the adsorption capacity of eggshell was conducted while
varying dye concentrations from 25 to 300 mg /L. Furthermore, the e ect of adsorbent dosage was
studied to optimize the adsorption process. pH was carefully adjusted between 3 and 11 to determine
the optimum pH to ensure the maximum DB78 removal. Apart from that, the e ect of temperature on
the adsorption of DB78 by eggshell was investigated at three di erent temperatures (29, 55, and 75C).
A typical experiment was conducted by adding the eggshell to 40 mL of di erent dye concentrations
of the DB78 solution. The mixture was stirred for a predetermined period of time at a constant speedMaterials 2020 ,13, 1262 4 of 18
of 500 rpm. The residual dye concentration in the solution was measured at time intervals (20, 40, 60,
80, 100, 120, and 140 min) until the equilibrium conditions were attained. At the end of each interval,
the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min to separate the solid phase, completely removing
impurities that may later a ect the measure.
The amount of dye adsorbed on eggshell ( qt) at time ( t), in mg /g, was determined by Equation (1),
as follows [29]:
qt=V(C0 Ce)
m(1)
where Vis the volume of dye solution (L); C0andCeare the initial and equilibrium concentrations of
dye in liquid phase (mg /L), respectively; and mis the mass of eggshell (g). All the experiments were
carried out in triplicate. Three adsorption kinetics models, three isotherms, and the thermodynamic
study were evaluated to elucidate the mechanism of dye adsorption.
2.6. Adsorption Kinetics
In order to analyze the mechanism of dye adsorption onto eggshell, and to predict the rate at
which a solute (dye) was removed from aqueous solution, three kinetic models could be employed:
pseudo-Ô¨Årst-order kinetic model [ 30], pseudo-second-order kinetic model [ 31], and intraparticle
diusion model [32].
The Lagergren‚Äôs equation for pseudo-Ô¨Årst-order kinetics is given by the following Equation
(2) [30]:
log(qe qt)=logqe k1
2.303t (2)
where qeandqtare the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and at time ( t) (mg /g), respectively, and k1
(min 1) is the rate constant of this model. From the linear plot of log ( qe qt) versus t, the rate constant
(k1) can be obtained by the slope.
The linear form of the Ho and McKay rate equation for pseudo-second-order kinetics is expressed
as Equation (3), as follows:
t
qt=1
k2qe2+1
qet (3)
where qeandqtare the adsorption capacity (mg /g) at equilibrium and at time ( t), respectively, and k2
(g/mg min) is the rate constant of this model and can be obtained from the intercept and slope of plot
t/qtversus t[31].
In the adsorption experiments, it is mandatory to Ô¨Åt the experimental data to the intraparticle
diusion model in order to analyze in depth the adsorption behavior of DB78 on eggshell, and to
know the rate-determining step in the liquid adsorption systems. In the adsorption of pollutants onto
adsorbents, di erent stages are di erentiated; in the Ô¨Årst one, there is a transport of the dye from the
solution to the adsorbent surface, followed by the di usion into the adsorbent, which is usually a slow
process [ 32]. In the di usion model proposed by Weber and Morris [ 33], the rate can be expressed in
terms of the square root time and can be determined as Equation (4), as follows:
qt=kip
t+C (4)
where qtis the adsorption capacity at any time t(mg/g); and kiis the rate constant of this model (mg /g
min1/2) and its values can be calculated from the slopes of plots qtversus t1/2, where tis the time (min)
andCis the intercept (mg /g).
2.7. Isotherm Analysis
The interaction between dyes and the adsorbent materials is described using di erent theoretical
models, known as adsorption isotherms. These isotherms are essential in the optimization of the
adsorption process [ 34,35]. Equilibrium isotherm equations were used to describe experimental sorptionMaterials 2020 ,13, 1262 5 of 18
data [ 36] and the parameters of equilibrium isotherms provide useful information on adsorption
mechanisms, a nity of the adsorbent, and surface properties [ 20]. Dierent isotherms were used to
analyze the adsorption equilibrium in this study: The Freundlich, Langmuir and Temkin models.
The Freundlich isotherm model suggests heterogeneity in the adsorption sites and takes into
account that the adsorption occurs at sites with di erent energy of adsorption. This isotherm is
obtained from the linear form of the Freundlich expression Equation (5) [36]:
ln q e=lnKF+1
nFlnCe (5)
where Ce(mg/L) and qe(mg/g) are the liquid phase concentration and solid phase concentration of dye
at equilibrium, respectively; 1 /nFis the heterogeneity factor; and KFis the Freundlich constant (L /g)
related to the bonding energy. 1 /nFandKFvalues were calculated from the slope and intercept of plots
lnqeversus ln Ce, respectively. The values of 1 /nFindicate the type of adsorption process: favorable
(0<1/nF<1), unfavorable (1 /nF>1), or irreversible (1 /nF=0) [37].
The Langmuir isotherm model assumes that the adsorption process happens at speciÔ¨Åc
homogeneous sites on the adsorbent. This model is probably the most employed adsorption isotherm
and is used successfully for the adsorption of contaminants from water solutions. The linearized form
of Langmuir model can be given as follows Equation (6) [33,38]:
Ce
qe=1
KL+aL
KLCe (6)
where Ceis the dye concentration at equilibrium in solution (mg /L),qeis the adsorption capacity (mg /g)
at equilibrium time, and KL(L/g) and aL(L/mg) are the Langmuir isotherm constants. The constants KL
andaLcan be calculated from the intercept (1 /KL) and the slope ( aL/KL) of the linear plot between Ce/qe,
andCe.qmaxis the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent (mg /g) and is determined by KL/aL.
The fundamental characteristic of Langmuir isotherm is the separation factor, which is a
dimensionless constant ( RL), and is given as follows Equation (7) [39]:
RL=1
1+aLCo(7)
where Cois the initial dye concentration (mg /L) and aLis the Langmuir constant related to the energy
of adsorption (L /mg). The calculated RLvalues indicate the type of adsorption: unfavourable process
(RL>1), linear ( RL=1), favourable ( RLbetween 0 and 1), or irreversible ( RL=0) [40].
The Temkin formula determines that the decrease of adsorption heat with coverage is linear because
of some adsorbate /adsorbent interactions. The adsorption is characterized by uniform distribution of
bond energies, up to a maximum bond energy [ 41]. The linear form of Temkin isotherm‚Äôs equation can
be expressed as Equation (8), as follows:
qe=RT
bTlnaT+RT
bTlnCe (8)
where Tis the absolute temperature (K); Ris the universal gas constant (8.314 J /mol K); aTis the
constant of Temkin isotherm (L /g);bTis the Temkin constant related to the heat of adsorption (J /mol);
andqeandCeare the equilibrium concentration of DB78 on eggshell (mg /g) and in the solution (mg /L),
respectively. The Temkin constants aTandbTvalues can be calculated from the slope and intercept of
straight line plot of qeversus ln Ce.
2.8. Thermodynamic Study
The thermodynamic analysis is needed to conclude whether the adsorption process of the dye onto
eggshell is exothermic or endothermic. In order to gain further insight related to these experiments, itMaterials 2020 ,13, 1262 6 of 18
is essential to calculate the value of DH(standard enthalpy change), DS(standard entropy change),
andDG(Gibbs standard free energy change). The values for the di erent thermodynamic parameters
can be calculated using the thermodynamic equilibrium coe cient obtained at di erent concentrations
and temperatures. The DGvalue is the fundamental parameter to elucidate the spontaneity of the
adsorption process, and reactions occur spontaneously when the value of DGis negative [34].
Considering the exchange adsorption, the equation employed to calculate the Kvalue at di erent
temperatures was as follows:
K=KpMadsorbate55.5 (9)
where Kpis the equilibrium constant at time t(L/g),Madsorbate is the molecular weight of DB78 (g /mol),
and 55.5 (mol /L) is the mole concentration of water [42].
Using the Kvalues obtained from the previous equation, the Gibbs free energy was determined
using the following equation:
DG= RTlnK(10)
To conÔ¨Årm the results for the Gibbs free energy, the Van‚Äôt Ho [12] equation was graphed (ln K
vs. 1 /T). Plotting ln Kversus 1 /Tgives a straight line with slope and intercept equal to  DH/RT
andDS/R, respectively, where Ris the universal gas constant (8.314 J /mol K) and Tis the absolute
temperature in Kelvin (K). Using this representation, the Gibbs free energy was calculated again using
the following equation:
DG=DH TDS(11)
2.9. Desorption and Regeneration of the Adsorbent
Desorption studies help to recover the adsorbate and adsorbent. Thus, the regeneration of the
adsorbent may be important to reduce cost processes and to recover the pollutant extracted from the
solution [ 37]. The viability of desorption and reuse of eggshell was evaluated using 0.5 M NaOH
solution. First, 0.5 g of eggshell was stirred with 40 mL of dye (100 mg /L, pH 5), at 25C, 100 min
of contact time, and 500 rpm for the adsorption phase. The adsorbent was dried and added into
40 mL of NaOH solution for desorption at a constant speed of 500 rpm for 100 min at 25C. The
dye concentration in the solution was measured at 100 min, after the centrifugation of the samples at
3000 rpm for 5 min to separate the solid phase.
2.10. Degradation of DB78 by an Advanced Oxidation Process
The adsorption experiment was carried out using di erent dye concentrations. After 140 min of
contact time and 300 mg /L of dye, the remaining dye in the solution was 144 mg /L. The experiments
were performed in triplicate, which means that 144 mg /L was the average of the three repetitions.
Then, 18 mL of the unadsorbed dye solution was mixed with 2 mL of a H 2O2solution that rendered a
Ô¨Ånal H 2O2concentration of 840 mg /L. This rendered an H 2O2/DB78 ratio of 200 on molar basis, which
is enough to avoid making H 2O2the limiting reagent of the photochemical reaction. The mixture was
placed in a pulsed light system (XeMaticA-Basic-1L, Steribeam, Germany) operated at 2.5 kV that
supplied 2.14 J /cm2per pulse of a broad-spectrum light that included UV light, the spectrum of which
has been previously reported [ 43]. Treatments were prolonged using multiple pulses up to 120 and
carried out in duplicate. Samples were withdrawn every Ô¨Åve pulses to measure absorbance. Data were
normalized and adjusted to pseudo-Ô¨Årst order kinetics (Equation (12)) to calculate the degradation rate.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. E ect of Eggshell Dosage
Dierent amounts of eggshell (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g) were added into DB78 solutions
to analyze the e ect of adsorbent dosage on adsorption. The e ect was investigated at an initial
concentration of 25 mg /L, pH 5, 120 min of contact time, constant stir (500 rpm), and room temperature
(25C). The results obtained from this study are shown in the plot of dye removal (%) versus adsorbent
dosage (g), as can be seen from Figure 1.

3.1. Effect  of Eggshell  Dosage   
Different amounts of eggshell (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 , and 2.0 g) were added into DB78 solutions to 
analyze the effect of adsorbent dosage on adsorption. The effect was investigated at an initial 
concentration of 25 mg/L, pH 5, 120 min of contact time, constant stir (500 rpm) , and room 
temperature (25 ¬∞ C). The results obtained from this study are shown in the plot of dye removal (%)

Figure  1. Effect of eggshell am ount on the adsorption of Direct Blue 78 ( DB78 ). 
The increase of the adsorbent led to a slight increase for dye removed until a maximum 
adsorption. This reveals that the removal efficiency of dye increased with increasing amounts of 
eggshell. At a dosage o f 0.5 g, the removal of dye was similar to higher doses ( 1‚Äì2 g), therefore, in 
order to optimize the adsorption process , and so to use the minimum amount of adsorbent, 0.5 g of 
eggshell w as used in order to study the kinetic and equilibrium experiments.  
3.2. Effect  of Initial  pH Solution  
The pH of dye solution is considered an essential factor in any adsorption process that affects 
the adsorption capacity and the adsorption mechanism of the eggshell. With the objective to 
investigate the effect of the initi al dye pH in the adsorption of DB78 dye on the eggshell surface, the 
equilibrium was studied at different pH values. The effect of pH in the adsorption of DB78 dye was 
evaluated in the range of pH from 3 to 11. The pH was adjusted by adding NaOH or HCl 0.1  M. The 
pH experiments were conducted using 2 g eggshell, at a concentration of 25 mg/L, 90 min of contact 
time, constant stir (500 rpm) , and room temperature (25 ¬∞ C) , and the results are shown in Figure  2. 
The result indicates that the adsorption capacity  and removal efficiency of eggshell depend on the 
pH.

The increase of the adsorbent led to a slight increase for dye removed until a maximum adsorption.
This reveals that the removal e ciency of dye increased with increasing amounts of eggshell. At a
dosage of 0.5 g, the removal of dye was similar to higher doses (1‚Äì2 g), therefore, in order to optimize
the adsorption process, and so to use the minimum amount of adsorbent, 0.5 g of eggshell was used in
order to study the kinetic and equilibrium experiments.
3.2. E ect of Initial pH Solution
The pH of dye solution is considered an essential factor in any adsorption process that a ects the
adsorption capacity and the adsorption mechanism of the eggshell. With the objective to investigate
the eect of the initial dye pH in the adsorption of DB78 dye on the eggshell surface, the equilibrium
was studied at di erent pH values. The e ect of pH in the adsorption of DB78 dye was evaluated in the
range of pH from 3 to 11. The pH was adjusted by adding NaOH or HCl 0.1 M. The pH experiments
were conducted using 2 g eggshell, at a concentration of 25 mg /L, 90 min of contact time, constant stir
(500 rpm), and room temperature (25C), and the results are shown in Figure 2. The result indicates
that the adsorption capacity and removal e ciency of eggshell depend on the pH.
As shown in Figure 2, the removal e ciency of dye increased at acidic pHs (3 and 5). From this
pH, the adsorption capability of the eggshell decrease from 94.5% to 63.4% at pH 11. Figure 2 shows
that the optimum pH required to obtain the maximum adsorption of DB78 onto eggshell is 5. The
isoelectric point for the eggshell is 5.5 [ 44], which is close to our optimum pH (5.0). At this pH, the
adsorbent is positively charged and interacts e ectively with the negative charges in DB78. This trend
was similar in the removal of Direct Red 80 and Acid Blue 25 dyes from aqueous solutions on eggshell
membrane, in which the adsorption capacities of both anionic dyes onto eggshell membrane increasedMaterials 2020 ,13, 1262 8 of 18

As shown in Figure  2, the removal efficiency of dye increased at acidic pHs (3 and 5). From this 
pH, the adsorption  capability of the eggshell decrease from 94.5% to 63.4% at pH 11. Figure  2 shows

was similar in the removal of Direct Red 80 and Acid Blue 25 dyes from aqueous solutions on eggshell 
membrane, in which the adso rption capacities of both anionic dyes onto eggshell membrane 
increased with acidic pHs [9] and, in another study, Chojnacka carried out the biosorption of Cr (III) 
ions from aqueous solutions by eggshells at pH 5 [45]. 
The principal component of the shell  is CaCO 3 in the form of the mineral calcite. In water, the 
carbonate species derived from calcite are H 2CO 3, HCO 3‚àí, and CO 32‚àí, and a sufficient amount  of 
carbonates is solubilized from the shells to buffer the mixtures to a low alkaline pH (from 7.5 to 8) 
after reaching the equilibrium. Therefore, at various pH, the electrostatic attraction as well as the 
structure o f dye molecules and the eggshell could play very important roles in dye adsorption on this 
adsorbent. At pH 5, a significantly high electrostatic attraction exists between the positively charged 
surface of the adsorbent, owing  to the ionization of function al groups of adsorbent and negatively 
charged dye. As the pH of the system increases, the number of negatively charged sites is increased. 
A negatively charged site on the adsorbent does not favor the adsorption of this dye owing  to the 
electrostatic repul sion [46,47] . 
3.3. Effect  of Contact  Time  
The following step in the adsorption experiments is to elucidate the effect of contact time using 
different concentrations of dye (from 25 to 300 mg/L). All the experiments were carried out at pH 5.0, 
constant stir  (500 rpm) , and room temperature (25 ¬∞ C), with a fixed amount of adsorbent (0.5 g) , and 
the results obtained are presented in Figure  3. 
As can be observed in Figure  3, the adsorption capacity increased in each concentration until the 
equilibrium was achiev ed. In the equilibrium, the amount of adsorbed dye inside the adsorbent and 
the amount of dye desorbed were in a dynamic equilibrium. The time required for the adsorption of 
the dye onto the adsorbent to attain the equilibrium state is called the equilibri um time and the 
amount of dye removed by the adsorbent at that time indicates the maximum adsorption capacity of 
the adsorbent under these conditions [48]. 
Figure 2. Eect of pH on the adsorption of DB78 by eggshell at di erent pH values.
The principal component of the shell is CaCO 3in the form of the mineral calcite. In water, the
carbonate species derived from calcite are H 2CO 3, HCO 3 , and CO 32 , and a su cient amount of
carbonates is solubilized from the shells to bu er the mixtures to a low alkaline pH (from 7.5 to 8)
after reaching the equilibrium. Therefore, at various pH, the electrostatic attraction as well as the
structure of dye molecules and the eggshell could play very important roles in dye adsorption on this
adsorbent. At pH 5, a signiÔ¨Åcantly high electrostatic attraction exists between the positively charged
surface of the adsorbent, owing to the ionization of functional groups of adsorbent and negatively
charged dye. As the pH of the system increases, the number of negatively charged sites is increased.
A negatively charged site on the adsorbent does not favor the adsorption of this dye owing to the
electrostatic repulsion [46,47].
3.3. E ect of Contact Time
The following step in the adsorption experiments is to elucidate the e ect of contact time using
dierent concentrations of dye (from 25 to 300 mg /L). All the experiments were carried out at pH 5.0,
constant stir (500 rpm), and room temperature (25C), with a Ô¨Åxed amount of adsorbent (0.5 g), and
the results obtained are presented in Figure 3.
As can be observed in Figure 3, the adsorption capacity increased in each concentration until the
equilibrium was achieved. In the equilibrium, the amount of adsorbed dye inside the adsorbent and
the amount of dye desorbed were in a dynamic equilibrium. The time required for the adsorption
of the dye onto the adsorbent to attain the equilibrium state is called the equilibrium time and the
amount of dye removed by the adsorbent at that time indicates the maximum adsorption capacity of
the adsorbent under these conditions [48].
Dierent adsorption stages can be di erentiated in the range of concentrations analyzed
(25‚Äì300 mg /L). At a low concentration (25 mg /L), the equilibrium was reached after 40 min of
contact. The adsorption was fast at the concentration of 100 mg /L, however, it was slower than at low
concentrations, reaching the equilibrium after 80 min of contact time. At high concentrations of dye
(>100 mg /L), the curves did not present the asymptotic form. Hence, the equilibrium time increased
with increasing concentrations of DB78 (from 150 to 300 mg /L).Materials 2020 ,13, 1262 9 of 18

Different adsorption stages can be differentiated in the range of concentrations analyzed (25‚Äì300

adsorption was fast at the concentration of 100 mg/L, however, it was slower than at low concentrations, reaching the equilibrium after 80 min of contact time. At high concentrations of dye 
(>100 mg/L), the curves did not present the asympt otic form. Hence, the equilibrium time increased 
with increasing concentrations of  DB78 (from 150 to 300 mg/L). 
3.4. Adsorption Kinetics 
The adsorption surface, mass transfer, or intraparticle diffusion are different mechanisms 
involved in the adsorption process and, to study them, three kinetic models were employed to test 
the experimental data obtained in the adsorption of DB78 on eggshell. The determination coefficient 
values (R

tested. The results for the adjustment to the ps eudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and the

The linearity of the Lagergren model (log( qe qt) versus t) was graphed for 140 min of contact
with the eggshell (Figure 4a). The R2values ranged from 0.800 to 0.995 (Table 1). Calculated values of
qewere compared with the experimental data, and although some R2values were relatively high, theMaterials 2020 ,13, 1262 11 of 18
qevalues calculated were not suitable. The obtained R2andqecalvalues indicated that the adsorption
of dye onto eggshell did not follow the pseudo-Ô¨Årst-order kinetics, even though some values were
relatively high; consequently, this equation cannot be used to analyze the experimental results. Because
of the obtained results, it was appropriate to Ô¨Åt the experimental data to the pseudo-second-order
model. Figure 4b shows the results obtained after applying the Ho and McKay model. The plot of t/qt
versus tproduced straight lines for the entire measurement range.
The theorical qevalues were identical to the experimental qevalues obtained using the
pseudo-second-order, as compared with those of the pseudo-Ô¨Årst-order kinetic, indicating that
DB78 adsorption onto eggshell followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. As can be observed
from Table 1, the R2values of the pseudo-second-order kinetic model are higher than those of
pseudo-Ô¨Årst-order, the value was 1 in all cases analyzed. These results suggested that chemical
adsorption was the rate-limiting step that controls this adsorption process. Chemisorption occurs
when strong interactions, including hydrogen bonding and covalent and ionic bond formation, occur
between the adsorbate and the solid surface. The endpoint for chemisorption is when all the active
sites on the solid surface are occupied by chemisorbed molecules. Ehrampoush et al. observed similar
kinetics in the adsorption of Reactive Red 123 dye onto eggshell [ 49], or in the adsorption of Acid
Orange 51 onto the ground eggshell powder [16].
The adsorption is a process that follows many steps; Ô¨Årstly, it implicates a transport of dye
molecules from the solution to the adsorbent surface, and then a di usion to the interior of the eggshell
could take place [ 32]. In order to understand the adsorption of DB78 dye onto eggshell, the kinetic of
the adsorption process was analyzed using the intraparticle di usion model, in order to determine if
the intraparticle di usion is the rate-limiting step in the adsorption. This e ect was studied by plotting
the amount of DB78 dye adsorbed versus the square root of time (Figure 4c).
Figure 4c shows the plot of qtversus t1/2for the intraparticle di usion of DB78 for the eggshell
and di erent concentrations of dye. Two di erent straight lines can be distinguished in Figure 4c for
the range of concentrations analyzed, indicating that two or more forces are inÔ¨Çuencing the adsorption
process; in this case, chemisorption and intraparticle di usion played essential roles in the adsorption
of DB78 onto eggshell (Figure 4c).
The intraparticle di usion constant ( ki) values are presented in Table 1. The values of kiandC
were calculated from the slope and intercept of plots of qtversus t1/2. These kivalues increased with
increasing dye concentrations. The R2values were very di erent depending on the concentration,
ranging from 0.704 to 0.995. The intraparticle di usion model was not the rate-controlling step because
the results did not pass through the origin. When this plot gives rise to a straight line, the adsorption
process is controlled by intra-particle di usion only. However, if the data present multi-linear plots,
then two or more steps inÔ¨Çuence the adsorption process, as shown in Figure 4. Similar results were also
reported for the adsorption of Acid Red 14 and Acid Blue 92 onto the microporous and mesoporous
eggshell membrane [37].
Conversely, the intercept of each curve is proportional to the boundary layer thickness; a higher
intercept indicates a higher e ect. This value decreased with increasing dye concentrations for the
eggshell; therefore, the intraparticle di usion model was not the sole rate-controlling step for eggshell,
conÔ¨Årming our previous suggestions [32].
3.5. Adsorption Equilibrium
The adsorption process of DB78 dye by eggshell adsorbent can be analyzed by Ô¨Åtting the
experimental data of adsorption equilibrium to di erent isotherm models to Ô¨Ånd the most suitable
isotherm to describe the adsorption process. Three well-known models were applied in the present
study: Freundlich, Langmuir and Temkin isotherms. The constant isotherm parameters obtained from
linear regression describe the equilibrium characteristics of adsorption, and are presented in Table 2.
The plot of ln qeversus ln Cegave a straight line over the entire concentration range studied in the
representation of the Freundlich isotherm, as may be observed in Figure 5a.Materials 2020 ,13, 1262 12 of 18

Thus, the straight line obtained was used to calculate the parameters KF,nF, and R2. In this
case, the KFwas 3.02 and nFwas 3.4 (Table 2). The process is favourable when the nFvalue was
found in the range between 1 and 10, which was conÔ¨Årmed for eggshell. A good linear determination
coecient ( R2=0.991) (Table 2) was obtained. The Freundlich model was the most suitable to describeMaterials 2020 ,13, 1262 13 of 18
the adsorption process owing to the high determination coe cient obtained. The linear form of the
Langmuir isotherm was obtained by plotting Ce/qeversus Ce, giving a straight line (Figure 5b). The
Langmuir isotherm constants aL/KLand 1 /KLwere determined from the slope and intercept of plot
(Ce/qevs.Ce), respectively. KL/aLisqmaxparameter, which is the maximum adsorption capacity of the
adsorbent (mg /g) (Figure 5b). The parameters and constants obtained for Langmuir can be observed in
Table 2. The maximum adsorption capacity of eggshell was 13 mg /g. Moreover, the value of R2was
0.975, but this value was lower than the Freundlich isotherm value.
This qmaxvalue was similar to that of other adsorbents, for example, using chitosan in the
adsorption of DB78 [ 15]; in the removal of various dyes using cellulose by-products, banana, and
orange peels [50]; or in the adsorption of methylene blue dye using raw olive stone [20].
According to the results obtained, the Freundlich model Ô¨Åtted better than the Langmuir model.
This may demonstrate the presence of heterogeneous adsorption sites on the eggshell surfaces. Similar
results were analyzed for the adsorption of Reactive Red 123 dye using eggshell, in which the Freundlich
and Langmuir isotherm models provided excellent Ô¨Åt with the highest R2value [ 49]. In another
study, Pramanpol and Nitayapat carried out the adsorption of Reactive Yellow 205 dye using various
components of eggshells and found a good concordance with the Freundlich model [51].
In the Langmuir isotherm, the value of RLdetermines if the adsorption process is favourable or
unfavourable. A value of RLin the range between 0 and 1 indicates that the process is favourable.
The values obtained for eggshell ranged from 0.281 to 0.032, conÔ¨Årming the adsorption process was
favourable (Figure 5c). At low concentrations, the highest RLvalues are also observed, indicating that
the adsorption is more favourable at those concentrations.
The plot of qeversus ln Ceshows the representation of the Temkin isotherm (Figure 5d). The
Temkin constants bTandaTwere determined from the slope and intercept, respectively. The bTvalue
obtained was 1.41 and the aTvalue was 6.73, as shown in Table 2. A positive value of bTindicates
that physical and chemical forces were involved in the adsorption process. The value of R2was 0.951.
The obtained result is lower than the Freundlich and Langmuir determination coe cients, with the
Freundlich model being the best isotherm to explain the experimental results.
3.6. Thermodynamic Study
In order to study the e ect of temperature on the adsorption of DB78 by eggshell, the experiments
were conducted at three temperatures (Figure 6) at a concentration of 50 mg /L, pH 5, 80 min of contact
time, and constant stir (500 rpm). The values of the thermodynamic parameters obtained at di erent
temperatures are presented in Table 3.

The standard free energy ( ŒîG¬∞) of the adsorption of DB78 onto eggshell was ‚àí24,417.19 J/mol, 
‚àí30,886.69 J/mol, and ‚àí34376.63 J/mol at temperatures of 29, 55, and 75 ¬∞C, respectively. The exergonic 
values obtained of ŒîG¬∞ indicated that the process is spontane ous at the three temperatures tested, 
confirming the viability of the process. The enthalpy change ( ŒîH¬∞) was 41,690.71 J/mol. The positive 
value of ŒîH¬∞ indicated the endothermic nature of the adsorption process. Table 3 shows that the 
value of ŒîG¬∞ decreased with the increasing temperatures. The value decreased from ‚àí24,417.19 to 
‚àí34,376.63 J/mol, which indicates a clear trend in the process. The adsorption process was favoured 
at high temperatures.  
As stated before, the thermodynamic analysis reve aled that, at 29 ¬∞C, there was not an increase

3.7. Desorption and Regeneration of the Adsorbent
Prior to the desorption measurements, it was mandatory to carry out adsorption experiments.
After this Ô¨Årst adsorption cycle, the adsorbent was put in an alkaline medium (pH 12). In the Ô¨Årst
desorption cycle, 21% of dye was released from the eggshell; this could explain the electrostatic
repulsion between the anionic dye and the negatively charged surface on the adsorbent. The ability
of the eggshell to desorb more dye molecules after four consecutive cycles could be attributed to the
distribution of charges on the adsorbent surface. After exposing the adsorbent to the same pH solution
four times, the adsorbent releases the dye more easily. Arami et al. observed similar results in the
adsorption of two di erent dyes onto the microporous and mesoporous eggshell membrane [37].
This adsorption /desorption cycle was repeated four times (Figure 8); according to the results
observed, the adsorption abilities of the eggshell decreased with the increasing the number of cycles.
This trend was the opposite for the desorption experiments. The results conÔ¨Årm that the eggshell can
be reused in di erent cycles of adsorption /desorption.Materials 2020 ,13, 1262 15 of 18

 3.7. Desorption and Regeneration of the Adsorbent 
Prior to the desorption measurements, it was ma ndatory to carry out adsorption experiments. 
After this first adsorption cycle, the adsorbent was put in an alkaline medium (pH 12). In the first 
desorption cycle, 21% of dye was released from the eggshell; this could explain the electrostatic 
repulsion between the anionic dye and the negatively charged surfac e on the adsorbent. The ability 
of the eggshell to desorb more dye molecules after fo ur consecutive cycles could be attributed to the 
distribution of charges on the adsorbent surface. After exposing the adsorbent to the same pH solution four times, the adsorbent releases the dye more easily. Arami et al. observed similar results 
in the adsorption of two different dyes onto the microporous and mesoporous eggshell membrane 
[37]. 
This adsorption/desorption cycle was repeated four times (Figure 8); according to the results 
observed, the adsorption abilities of the eggshell decreased with the increasing the number of cycles. This trend was the opposite for the desorption expe riments. The results confirm that the eggshell can 
be reused in different cycles of adsorption/desorption.

3.8. Degradation of DB78 by an H 2O2/Pulsed Light AOP 
The degradation of DB78 by the H 2O2/pulsed light AOP can be observed in Figure 9. The process 
was able to degrade the dye by more than 95%, which can be considered a significant reduction in the contamination potential of this dye if released  to the environment. The respective pseudo-first 
order degradation rate was 0.012 cm
2/J (R2 = 0.9967). Prolonging the treatment would not be efficient 
as data extrapolation allows predicting 99% degradation after supplying an energy of 383 J/cm2, 
which means expending 49% more energy to increase the degradation by only 4%.

4. Conclusions 
The present study showed that eggshell can be successfully utilized as a biosorbent for the 
removal of DB78 dye from water solutions. It wa s found that the adsorption of DB78 onto eggshell 
followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The Freund lich isotherm was the best model to describe 
adsorption. The maximum adsorption of DB78 onto eggshell was obtained at pH 5 and 0.5 g of 
adsorbent dosage. According to the Langmuir isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacity of DB78 onto eggshell was 13 mg/g. Taking into account the results obtained for the n
F and RL parameters, the 
adsorption is considered as favorable. The analys is of thermodynamic parameters revealed that the 
adsorption process is endothermi c and spontaneous at the three te mperatures analyzed. Desorption 
studies were conducted and the results showed that the eggshell was reusable in different 
adsorption/desorption cycles. Complement ing the adsorption process by an H 2O2/pulsed light 
advanced oxidation process allows further decr easing the release of pollutant dyes to the 
environment, proving that the combination of bo th techniques can be us ed successfully in the 
removal of dyes from wastewater at higher concentrations of dye.
