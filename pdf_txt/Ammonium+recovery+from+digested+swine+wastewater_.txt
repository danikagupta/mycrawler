 Abstract  
Excessive livestock production in small areas poses a risk of nitrogen release to the environment and thus air and water contamination. Recovery of ammonia is necessary to avoid overfertilization, but manure management of untreated slurry is costly and complex. The authors discuss ammonium fertilizer recovery from manure using membrane processes and physicochemical methods including technology and energy assessments. Currently, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, membrane dist illation combined with ultrafiltration, and air 
stripping are the best choices. The processes rely highly on selection of appropriate pretreatment, as residual particulates will lead to fouling of membranes and stripping towers hence affect the performance greatly.  
 Keywords : ammonia recovery, biofertilizers, slurry, membrane technology, physicochemical

INTRODUCTION
Projections indicate that the world population of close to 7 billio n will  grow to 9.3 billion  by 
2050 (1). The food production needs to increase over 2 per cent every year up to 2030 with 
doubling of current global production by 2050 to meet the demands of the larger population 
(2, 3) . As this increase in food production will have to occur on less arable land this can only 
be achieved by enhancing production (4).  
Nitrogen is one of the most essential plant nutrients, and is often the most important 
determinant of plant growth and crop yield (5 -7). Chemical fertilizers add N in readily 
available form to plants resulting in intensification of food production and increased yield.(8).  
Commercial fertilizers are currently  responsible for 40–60% of the world’s food resources 
(9).  However, only about half of the N -fertilizers are taken up by crops, while the other half 
is lost to the atmosphere as ammonia (NH 3), nitrogen oxides (NO x), nitrous oxide (N 2O) or to 
aquatic systems, as nitrate (NO 3−) (10). Ammonia and nitrogen oxides contribute to soil 
pollution via acid deposition,11 water pollution via eutrophication (12) and to global warming (13). Furthermore, increasing concentrations of N
2O in the atmosphere is responsible for 
ozone layer depleti on (14). The estimated ammonia emission from N -fertilizer is equal to 10 –
12 million tons per year (15) .  
Livestock production is increasingly carried out on farms with relatively small land areas 
attached. This has resulted in excessive production of anima l wastes that no longer can be 
applied sustainably in the region as fertilizer (16). Transport of nutrient surplus from the farm 
over long distances is hence necessary to avoid excess load of nutrients and to mitigate 
environmental problems. Problems assoc iated with high costs of transport, loss of nutrients to 
the environment and over -fertilization can be partly solved by separating manure into a liquid 
fraction rich in inorganic N and potassium (K) and a solid fraction rich in phosphorus (P) (17). The sol id fiber fraction can be used for instance as soil conditioner, as fertilizer on P -2 
 deficient regions with few or no animals, as a substrate for biogas plants or for energy 
production by incineration (18–21). The liquid fraction from separated slurry has a high water  
content and low nutrient concentration. It is usually intended to be used on farmlands near animal production as a fast acting N -fertilizer with lower ammonia emission than raw slurry 
(18,22) However, the unbalanced production of animal waste in  regions with too little 
demand of the nutrients calls for separation. The purpose of any further separation of the liquid fraction is to decrease its volume and concentrate N and K in easily transportable and usable fractions which can be sold and make a profit (23). Based on a Spanish market survey, an ammonium -sulfate solution with a nitrogen content of 6% w/w and low organic content 
could be sold at a price of 0.35 € kg
−1 N, while the management cost of untreated slurry in the 
Netherlands is 4 –9 € kg−1 N (21,22). Moreover, nitrogen pollution costs the European Union 
between 70 and 100 billion € per year, where agriculture contributes significantly to the reactive N runoff in water.24 As a consequence of environmental issues and for economic reasons, ammo nia recovery from manure is necessary (25).  
This review aims to support decision making on the reuse of manure ammonium as fertilizer. Therefore, we discuss critically different methods for ammonium fertilizer production from animal wastes and include a t echnology and energy assessment . For convenience of this paper 
the methods available for ammonia recovery are divided into membrane and physicochemical 
processes . The review paper covers research involving: air stripping (AS), steam stripping, 
chemical precipitation (CP), ion exchange (IE), nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis (ED), and membrane distillation (MD). As these methods to a varying degree require removal of particulate matter, the review also includes pretreatment of manure  using 
solid -liquid separation, chemical additions, and micro-  (MF) and/or ultrafiltration (UF) .  
 
TECHNOLOGIES FOR MANURE PRETREATMENT 
Solid -Liquid Separation 
Before ammonia can be recovered from manure, the manure has to be  separated in a solid 
fraction rich in P and a liquid fraction rich in N. The  obtained liquid fraction should be low in 
dry matter in order to improve the  ammonia recovery, as particulate solids lead to membrane 
fouling, clogging of air stripping towers and impede chemical precipitation  or ion exchange.  
Solid -liquid separation may be performed in sedimentation tanks, where  the settled solids are 
removed from the bottom of the tank (22). Settling of particles  can be reinforced by 
increasing the gravitational force, as done in  decanter cen trifuges  (22). Alternatives for solids 
removal are mechanical filtration  using screw presses or drainage through press or belt filters  
(22). In 2010, Hjorth et al.  (22) and in 2013 Christensen et al. (26) reported extensive reviews 
of options for solid- liquid separation of animal slurries. Based on their studies, separation 
efficiency of mechanical separators for the removal of dry matter  and N in descending order is 
as follows: centrifugation > sedimentation >  nonpressurized filtration > pressurized filtration. 
Moreover, sedimentation is  a relatively simple and cheap method for removing solids from 
manure  (22). The duration of sedimentation is highly dependent on the initial dry matter  
content. The highest  removal reported (60%) was obtained when initial  dry matter was 
between 10 –20 g·l−1 (22). The particle removal efficiency of  decanter centrifuges increases 
with dry matter content. Decanter centrifuges  were found to be more successful in retaining 
particl es of size larger than  20–25 μm in the solid fraction (22). Drainage in general is more 
efficient in  separating cattle slurry than pig manure due to a higher fraction of larger  particles 
in cattle manure. Drainage can be hindered by particles clogging the filter. This increases the 
specific filter resistance. This is especially the  case for particles within the range of 1 and 100 
μm (27) Most of the N is found in dissolved form or in particles below 125 μm in size. Thus, 
most of N will end up in the liquid effluent after drainage with some remaining in the wet 
filter cake (22). The application of pressure in a screw press or belt filter press  enables more 3 
 of the liquid and small particles to pass through the filter. This  leads to a decrease in N 
separation e fficiency  (22). 
 
The Use of Coagulants and Flocculants  
The efficiency of solid -liquid separation can be enhanced by addition of cations or polymers 
resulting in fine particles aggregation due to coagulation and/or flocculation(22,26). Flocculation will lea d to production of a cleaner effluent which is desired before further 
ammonia recovery. At the same time though polymers will also increase the concentration of NH
4+ retained in the flocs in the solid fraction (22). There are examples of full -scale solid -
liquid separation plants combined with flocculation using polyacrylamide polymer (PAM) 
operated on pig farms in Spain, Italy, and the United States(28–30) and combinations of coagulation and flocculation on central manure separation plants in the Netherlands.(31,32). Martinez- Almela and Barrera(28) reported on the full -scale separation efficiency using the 
Ecopurin system. The Ecopurin system gave a reduction of 84–95% of total suspended solids (TSS) and 19–47% of NH
4+ in the effluent. Even better results we re reported by Vanotti et 
al.(30), obtaining 93% removal of TSS, 78% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and losing only 4% of NH
4-N using also the Ecopurin solid- liquid separation module. Riano and Garcia -
Gonzalez (29) tested a screw press combined with flocculation. They achieved the lowest separation efficiency, 68% removal of total solids (TS), 70% of COD, and 2% of NH
4-N. 
Foged (32) reported a 78% removal of TSS and a 22% retention of total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) after flocculation with PAM and filtration on a belt filter on the Kumac Mineralen plant (NL). However, flocculants have also lead to membrane fouling when effluent from solid -liquid separation with low suspended solids content is used as a feed. This suggests that 
surplus polymer remained in the liquid after flocculation.33 Hoeksma et al. (31) and Foged(32) reported that coagulation of the belt filter liquid fraction with Fe
3(SO 4)2 followed 
by air flotation alleviates this problem to such an extent, that the liquid fraction can be applied 
to RO concentration. At Kumac Mineralen, the solid fraction is skimmed off during flotation. 
The liquid fraction is then subjected to depth filtration on a continuous paper filter. Though 
Hoeksma et al (31) does not include a depth filtration in their process de scription, a visit to 
Gebrüderen Verkoyen’s manure separation plant in the Netherlands, confirms that this step is 
necessary before RO (34).  
The use of chemical additives such as polymers and inorganic salts may though have a 
negative impact on the environment if the solid fraction is applied to soils as fertilizer (35).  
 
Microfiltration  
Studies on microfiltration of animal wastes  focus on removal of suspended solids  (SS), 
organic matter  (OM), nitrogen and phosphorus from manure. Microfiltration of pig manure 
has been found unsuccessful  (36) nevertheless  it works well for sow manure ( 37) and piggery 
wastewater  (38). A direct comparison of the experiments is difficult as the feed varies up to 
tenfold in TS. The operating conditions vary also. However, some general conclusions can 
still be drawn based on  the work done so far . A s ummary of current studies on MF are 
presented in Table 1.

Prior to microfiltration, raw slurry is commonly first subjected to traditional separation units using chamber filter presses, vibrating screens, liquid cyclones, decanter centrifuges, or screw presses (37). However, additional prefiltration steps are nece ssary to avoid that sand and other 
particles clog or damage the membrane. Pieters et al. (37) applied 100 μ m bag filters to 
increase membrane lifetime. Different pretreatment techniques have been used for effluents from anaerobic digesters like for instanc e decanter centrifuges (36) or stainless steel prefilters 5 
 (38). Lee et al. (38) reported that the best membrane performance was achieved with a 63 μm 
pore size prefilter.    
The highest flux has been achieved using ceramic membranes, with mean flux equals 6 4.1 L 
m-2 h-1 at 34°C and 1.7 bar (37) . The best permeate quality with the lowest SS, COD, and 
biological oxygen demand (BOD) was reached by mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membranes with a maximum flux of 38 l·m
−2·h−1 at 20 ◦C (38). It may be explained by the  material and 
filtrationproperties of cellulose esters. Cellulose esters have a high permeability toward water and low solubility toward the salts  (39). Additionally, the ceramic  membranes make use of 
screen filtration, whereas the cellulose esters work  by depth filtration. Thus, in ceramic 
membranes particle size exclusion dominates,  while when MCE membranes are used, particle 
adsorption initially  dominates.  
Ceramic membranes have advantages compared to polymeric membranes. They have a narrow pore size distribution, are easy to clean, tolerate a wider range of pH,40 and have longer expected lifetimes. Despite those advantages, inorganic membranes at present are not favorable economically compared to polymeric membranes. This is due to a much higher membrane cost (40). Because of the high fouling potential of the feed, frequent or unforeseen membrane replacement can be necessary. It is therefore important to use low cost membranes that have the lowest possible impact on the economic viability of the plant.

These studies show that ultrafiltration is able to  remove most of organic particles and 
suspended solids larger than approximately 100 kDa including bacteria. Similar to MF, ultrafiltration performance depends on the pretreatment methods. Fixed filters did not succeed in prefiltering digested cattle manur e to a sufficient degree  (41) whereas rotating filters with 
pore size of 60 μm efficiently removed suspended solids  (42). To reduce fouling effects on 
the UF, removal  of suspended solids or attempts to change physicochemical properties of raw 
pig manure, s ettling (ST), settling combined with sieving (SAS), settling combined with 
biological treatment and sieving (SB), vacuum filtration (VF), and centrifugation have been tested (43,44).  
The largest flux decline was observed for pig manure, which was vacuum fi ltrated (600 μm), 
and the smallest change of flux with the highest permeate quality was achieved with sieved (500 μm), biologically treated, and settled supernatant  (43). The flux decrease can be 
explained by two phenomena: polarization and cake layer form ation. Better results obtained 
for settled  and settled and sieved manure supernatant compared to vacuum filtrated effluent 
could be due to ageing and particle size. VF effluent contained bigger organic particles, while ST and SAS supernatants were composed of aerobically and anaerobically degraded organic 
matter. It is highly probable that the higher organic content resulted in greater fouling of the membrane observed as a sharp flux decrease. A sharp decrease of flux from 100 to 5 l·m
−2·h−1 
was noticed aft er two months during separation of digested pig manure with a tubular 
polyethersulfone (PES) membrane  (45). Also Lopez -Fernandez et al.46 reported a 93% 
decrease in permeability using a PES membrane, while when using a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) memb rane only a 25% decrease was observed. This demonstrates that 
PVDF membranes are more fouling resistant. The pore size has also a significant effect on fouling as mentioned previously in relation to the filtration properties. Konieczny et al. (44) 
reported  that a PVDF membrane with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 100 kDa had 7 
 lower  permeate flux than a PVDF membrane with a 50 kDa MWCO.  This could be due to 
different fouling mechanisms (i.e., pore blockage and cake formation). The pore blockage was 
attrib uted to the presence of large  pores in the PVDF membrane with a 100 kDa MWCO. 
Large pores are easily  available for particles, resulting in particles blocking the pore mouth by 
bridging or blocking the pores as a result of depth filtration. For the PVDF  mem brane with a 
50 kDa MWCO, separation initially occurs by screen filtration as particles and macrosolutes 
are unable to penetrate the membrane pores. This leads to fouling by cake formation ( 47).  
 Summary of Manure Pretreatment Methods  
The choice of pretreatment method depends mainly on the planned strategy for ammonia recovery. In general, most of the membrane processes available for ammonia recovery will require polishing via MF, UF, or a combination of chemically induced flocculation with flotation  and filtration. This increases operational costs. On the other hand, most of the 
physicochemical methods have lower demands on particles removal. These requirements can usually be fulfilled by solid- liquid separation or chemically induced flocculation com bined 
with filtration.  
 
 
TECHNOLOGIES FOR AMMONIA RECOVERY 
 
Membrane Processes  
Nanofiltration  
Nanofiltration membranes are characterized by a MWCO in the range of 150 –300 Da, which 
typically displays a very high rejection (> 99%) of multivalent ions, high rejection of organic 
molecules larger than the MWCO (> 90%) and  lower rejection of monovalent ions  (48). The 
latter can be between 0% and  70% (48). Therefore, NF should not be efficient in the recovery 
of ammonia as  isolated molecule or ion. An exampl e is X -FLOWs NF50 M10 membranes  
with reported retentions of NaCl and MgSO 4 of 35% and 94%, respectively.49 
It is to be expected that the rejection patterns of ammonium ion (NH 4+) in the hydrated form is 
comparable to the potassium ion (K+) (50). 
Total ammo niacal nitrogen present in manure is divided between ammonia  (NH 3), which 
permeate freely through dense NF membranes, and  ammonium (NH 4+) ions, which are 
actually retained by membranes due  to loose complex formation with anions in the manure 
such as HCO 3−, PO 43−, and VFAs  (51). This effect has been seen as well in RO membranes 
(will be discussed in the Reverse Osmosis section). Adjustment of manure pH  can be useful in 
combination with NF depending on whether retention or  permeation of TAN is the aim: low 
pH favors ammonium (NH 4+) retained  with complexes, where high pH favors free ammonia 
with higher permeation. Therefore, nanofiltration can concentrate or separate soluble nutrients  
from pig slurry and be used for water recovery. Konieczny et al. (44) used a n integrated 
system of centrifugation/two -step ultrafiltration/nanofiltration to  obtain a filtrate with an 
ammonium (NH 4+) concentration of 96–135 mg·l−1 and total organic carbon (TOC) with 7.6–
10 mg·l−1. This filtrate could be  used as sanitary safe water applicable for flushing animals, 
farmhouses or  for irrigation purposes  (44). Kertesz et al.  (52) used a classical cross -flow 
process  and a vibratory shear -enhanced process (VSEP) to reduce total volume and  dry matter 
of the liquid fraction from centrifuged pig manure. The VSEP thin film composite (TFC) 
polyamide membrane gave higher fluxes and better  total soluble solids retention (93.59%) 
compared to the cross -flow module  (58.82%)  (52). 
The obtained lower fluxes using the cross -flow module are caused by concentration 
polarization and cake formation. Concentration polarization leads to a concentration gradient 
of ions or molecules near the membrane  surface and thus to a local increase in o smotic 8 
 pressure. Organic molecules  are likewise accumulated, which promotes gel formation  (53). 
Kertesz et al.  (52) reported a rapid flux decrease from 40 to 8.6 l·m−2·h−1 in the first few  
minutes of the cross -flow process. This can be caused by concentrat ion polarization and later 
by a gel layer formed from the accumulated particles  at the membrane surface. Furthermore, 
Konieczny et al.  (44) observed a flux decline after 1.5 h, caused by fouling and scaling.  
Fouling is a complex function of physical and chemical properties of  feed (pH, ionic strength, 
concentration, temperature), foulants nature, hydrodynamics  conditions, and membrane 
characteristics (pore geometry, surface charge, surface roughness, and hydrophobicity)  (54). 
By identifying the key  parameters responsible for the flux deterioration, it is therefore 
possible to mitigate fouling.  
Initially, the flux decline can be countered by applying higher cross -flow velocities generating 
high shear forces in the liquid layer at the membrane  surface. This reduces the concentration 
gradient and leads to better flux (45). Intermittent washing with pure water have also been 
shown to enhance membrane  performance (44). Furthermore, using hydrophilic membranes 
reduce the  probability of fouling (53) because hydrophobic membranes are more prone  to 
interact with hydrophobic manure components such as proteins  (55). Surface roughness also 
has an impact on hydrodynamics and additionally offers nucleation sites, hence may induce 
fouling (56). In addition, tighter membranes  are generally less prone to fouling due to reduced 
probability of pore blocking ( 57) as previously mentioned. 
The pretreatment with chemicals and filtration a s described by Hoeksma  et al.  (31) should 
also work for NF, but we have found no experimental evidence  of this.  
To conclude, a combination of pretreatment consisting of centrifugation, followed by UF to 
remove suspended solids combined with appropriately selected equipment to improve NF 
performance ensures an effective NF  operation with reduced fouling. 
 
Reverse Osmosis  
RO just as nanofiltration allows concentration of ammonium. At the same time, RO produces 
water applicable for flushing animal houses  (58). If the RO permeate is subjected to 
consecutive RO cycles or is treated with zeolites  (59) or ion exchange resins  (32,34),  the 
permeate can be discharged as clean water directly to the environment. Reverse osmosis can 
also reduce the volume of animal wastes. In a case of pig slurry, the reduction was 60%, while 
for hog sow slurry the reduction was 77%  (37,60).  A summary of recent studies on RO is 
presented in Table 3 .

 Polyamide (PA) membranes have frequently been used for manure treatment  with RO (Table 
3). This is due to their high selectivity toward salts and broad pH operating range  (39,61).  
Improved performance can be achieved when  the slurry is first microfiltrated or vacuum 
filtrated  (37,62).  Properly chosen pretreatment  based on Silt Density Index (SDI) for the 
selected membranes is  a key for long- term RO system operation. This is despite  the fact that 
there is no linear correlation between the SDI index and the concentration of  foulants  (63,64).  
More pretreatment is required for untreated manure compared  to digested manure as 
undigested manure contains larger particles.58 VSEP  systems req uire removal of larger 
particles, where 100 or 150 μm prescreens  have been used for both digested and undigested 
pig slurry and hog manure  on farms in Korea, Japan, the United States, and Canada  
(58,60,65–67).  The pretreatment process described by Hoeksma et al.  (31) and Foged (32) 
makes it  possible to use spiral wound cross -flow RO systems. At least five manure  separation 
plants are currently running in the Netherlands based on this  principle  (31,32) . 
Compared to nanofiltration, obtained fluxes are lower e ven when higher  pressure is applied 
(Table 3), although Kertesz et al.  (52) has reported permeate  fluxes almost identical to NF 
fluxes when a VSEP system was used (68 and 71 l·m−2·h−1, respectively). For sow slurry, 
higher fluxes were also obtained by increasing concentration factors from 1.3 to 4.1 and by 
subjecting the  permeate to a second microfiltration step  (37). VSEP systems succeeded in 
removing 95% of total soluble solids, while traditional cross -flow mode only removed 88%  
(52). Based on Hoeksma  et al.’s data (31) slurry from fatteners and sows pretreated by 
flocculation, aeration, and filtration treated by a crossflow  RO succeeds with the removal of 
solids above 98%. This is close to the  results obtained by Johnson et al. (67) who reported 
100% removal of TSS for  cow manure. For a VSEP RO system, digested manure showed 
larger fluxes  (30.5 l·m−2·h−1) and water recovery (75%) than for untreated pig slurry (23.6 
l·m−2·h−1 and 50%, respectively)  (58). The permeate quality is also slightly better  for an 
anaerobically treated manure compared to raw manure.68 Better  results have been presented 
by the manufacturer of VSEP, New Logic  (65). The reported water recovery from hog manure 
was 80%  (65). TAN retention was  in the range of 93% to 99.8% producing concentrate with 
TAN between  6–10 g·l−1.51,62 This is similarly to what Hoeksma et al. (31) and Hoeksma 
and de Buisonj é (69) reported for four spiral wound cross -flow RO full -scale plants.  They 
found TAN retentions above 95% with concentrations between 4 and  8 g·l−1. Even better 
results were obtained when swine manure was subjected  to electrodialysis prior to RO 
producing concentrate with 13 g·l−1 of NH 3-N (70). 
A rapid decrease of flux was observed during separation of pig slurry indicating conce ntration 
polarization and fast deposition of particles on membrane  surfaces  (60). Massé  et al.  (62) 
reported a flux decrease from 27 to 18 l·m−2·h−1 in laboratory scale experiments and a flux 
decrease from 36 to  8 l·m−2·h−1 in pilot scale runs due to concentration polarization. This is in 
accordance with the results reported by Hoeksma and de Buisonj é (69) from  four Dutch 
manure separations plants. Here, the water flux can be inferred  to vary between 4 and 8 
l·m−2·h−1. 
Perfo rmance of RO is a function of feed temperature and total solid content  (60,65).  A 
warmer feed is less viscous and more soluble in the membrane.  This leads to a higher 
permeability in the membrane. Similarly, a lower total solid content increases the flux by 
reducing fouling, concentration polarization and osmotic pressure.65 In the case of pig 
manure, an increase of  temperature from 10 to 20◦C raised the flux 50% with a subsequent 
loss of ammonia  (60,68 ). Higher fluxes reduce the size of RO plants, thus reducing the 
investment costs. Pressure increase for reverse osmosis from 30 to 60 bar decreased COD, 
NH 3-N, total N and K concentrations in the permeate  (37). However, when the pressure was 
increased above 20 bar, concentration polarization increases at the membrane surface, which 12 
 resulted in an increase  of osmotic pressure  (62). Therefore, to be able to use RO technology, it 
is necessary to use membranes that can sustain high applied pressure  (62). 
Lowering the pH from 8.2 to 6.2 prevents de position of poorly soluble  salts on the 
membranes. It also has a positive effect on removal of P and  N, but a negative effect on COD 
as it may decrease rejection of molecules  responsible for COD in the permeate (e.g., 
unionized volatile fatty acids  [VFAs],  which can pass the membrane)  (37,51).  As described 
previously, lowering pH or temperature shift the equilibrium toward NH 4+. Thus NH 4+ has 
higher retention, due to complexes formation (37,51).  In the case of raw sow  slurry, TAN 
retention increased from 82% to 92%, when pH decreased from  8.2 to 6.2. For digested 
manure, when pH dropped from 8 to 4, retention was nearly 100%  (37,68).  Massé  et al.  (51) 
reported 99% retention of NH 4+ at pH  below 6.5 when concentrated sulfuric acid was used for 
manure acidification.  Acidification of the manure though has no influence on the flux, but  can 
successfully convert carbonates to carbon dioxide. This minimizes the  risk of scaling ( 63,68).  
Moreover, the surface charge change with pH for some membrane materials  like for instance 
PA, so PA develops a positive surface charge when operating below the isoelectric point of 
the membrane (pH 4 –5 for PA).  This can also enhance NH 4+ retention as pH does not only 
change the feed  properties  (51,71).  
Fouling has also been a problem during RO operation. Even when VSEP systems have been 
used, fouling appeared. This happens especially during filtration of digested manure 
containing mainly smaller particles  (58). However, if colloidal or suspended solids have been 
removed, compare d to porous MF or UF membranes, the risk of surface fouling is reduced 
(72). Furthermore, chemical cleaning with a 1%wt alkaline detergent restores the  original flux  
(51,60,62,68).  
 
Electrodialysis  
Electrodialysis  enabled production of a concentrate with 14 g·l−1 NH 3-N (70). Mondor  et al.  
(70) concluded that thin and more conductive cation/anion exchange  membranes: CMX/AMX 
and CMB/AMX -SB membranes had a higher NH 4+ transfer rate than cation exchange 
membranes LMP/AR 103 QDP due to a higher  current for a given voltage applied. It was 
found that around 75% of the current was used to transfer the ammonium, whereas the rest was lost  as heat or used to transfer other cations such as potassium. Unfortunately, after 2 h of 
manure filtration, AMX -SB membranes cracked and also on CMX membranes spots were 
observed suggesting fouling. Cleaning procedure composed of chemical cleaning with 0.5% NaOH for 20 min, rinsing with water, cleaning with 1% HCl for 20 min, and again rinsing 
with water was used. It  resulted in complete restoration of the CMB membrane and almost 
complete restoration of AMX membranes (91%)  (73). Analysis of the foulants revealed 
presence of oxygen, calcium, and silica  (73). Moreover, a dark color on the AMX membrane 
indicates that fou ling possibly is organic in nature  (73). Removal of ammonium and other 
cations therefore seems possible using ED, but further investigations are needed.

Figure 1 Influence of temperature and pH on the ratio of ammonia partial pressure to total  
ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) concentration ( – 65◦C, – 40◦C, ···· 25◦C). 
 
Membrane contactors  
As alternative to separating ammonia from the slurry using RO the difference in vapor pressure between the slurry constituents can be used. This approach is used in c onventional 
ammonia stripping using packed columns (air stripping)  and in membrane contactors  (MD). 
In order for the total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) to evaporate it has to be in the form of ammonia. The equilibrium that governs this reaction is  
             NH
4+ + H 2O ⇌ NH 3 + H 3O+                                  (1)  
The equilibrium and hence solubility of ammonia in slurry is influenced by temperature and 
to a lesser extent by the ionic strength of the slurry. 
As seen from  figure 1, ammonia vapor pressure ratio to the total TAN is more influenced by 
pH than by temperature. As the water vapor pressure also increases with temperature a high pH, but a moderate temperature is to be preferred in order to get high ammonia removal but 
low water removal.  
In MD, the alkalinized slurry is brought into contact with a porous, hydrophobic membrane. 
The nonwetted membrane will reject liquid but will allow vapor to pass through the pores. On 
the permeate side in MD, an acid solution is used to absorb the NH
3 vapor, the typical acid 
being sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) leading to ammonium sulfate (NH 4)2SO 4 formation. As the vapor 
pressure of (NH 4)2SO 4 is zero in acidic solutions, the driving force for the process is the 
alkaline NH 3 vapor pressure alone.  
Membrane distillation successfully removed ammonia from digested manure in lab and pilot scale and from wastewater in industrial scale (74,75). When pH in the slurry was raised above 9 by alkali addition, a NH
4+-N concentration of 53 g·l−1 could be reached in the permeate 
(76). Du Preez et al. (23) used a polypropylene (PP) membrane using several pretreatments 
such as ultrafiltration and chemical precipitation for anaerobically digested pig manure achieving ammonia removal efficiencies between 99.2–99.9%. Without any pretrea tment, 
Waeger -Baumann and Fuchs (77) used a PP membrane at pH 10 and a temperature of 40
◦C 
obtaining 98.5% ammonia removal. The N -depleted manure produced had a concentration of 
42 mg NH 4+-N per l.   
14 
 As in reverse osmosis, increasing temperature and pH enha nced ammonia mass transfer. By 
increasing the temperature from 15 to 70◦C, ammonia mass transfer increased almost 10 times  
(23). Even at a pH above 10, an increase in temperature has a pronounced effect on ammonia 
removal efficiency ( 23). This is mainly ca used by an increase in the diffusivity of ammonia in 
the gas and liquid phase and a decrease in slurry viscosity, both effects leading to a higher 
mass transfer rate. The membrane distillation module configuration also has an impact on the 
mass transfer ra te and thus economy of the whole process  (77). When manure is introduced to 
a tubular membrane on the lumen side, it requires prior removal of suspended solids (e.g., by ultrafiltration to avoid clogging the membrane module), while when manure  is introduce d to 
the membrane on the shell side the pretreatment step can be omitted  (23,76,77).  However, one 
of the disadvantages using this configuration might be a nonuniform flow as a result of channel formation, bypassing, mixing, and dead zones which decrease ma ss transfer 
efficiency  (78). When ultrafiltered slurry permeate was introduced on the lumen side, the 
transfer rate was about 1.5 times higher compared to when the feed was introduced on the shell side  (77). The results obtained for untreated manure digest ate fed to the shell side of the 
module were slightly lower than results for ultrafiltered permeate  (77). This is in agreement 
with Ahn et al.  (79), who reported inhibitory effects of suspended solids on mass transfer 
while using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes. However, it should be investigated further if a  higher mass transfer rate is more economically advantageous when manure  is 
introduce d on the lumen side, than when manure is introduced on the shell side, because no 
solid removal step is required in the latter case.

 Comparison of membrane processes  
In 2007, Massé  et al (80) reviewed most of the membrane technologies for manure treatment. 
The review identified reverse osmosis as the most efficient for nutrient concentration, though limited at industrial scale by high cost of operation. In this review, membrane technologies are compared based on module type (Table 4), processes (Table 5), and materials (Table 6). Table 4 presents membrane technologies for ammonia recovery categorized according to the applied module. Five main categories can be distinguished: plate and frame, spiral wound, tubular, hollow fiber, and capillary.  
In most cases, flat sheet or tubular membranes have been used for manure processing because they are easier to clean (39). Hollow fiber and capillary membranes are more prone to fouling or pore blocking by particulate matter. Hence, they are difficult to clean and therefore require more feed pretreatment, except when they are used in membrane distillation configuration with the manure fed to the shell side (39,76,77).  
Karakashev et al. (36) reporte d difficulties with cleaning submerged capillary membranes with 
air and water, as membranes clogged totally after 3 –4 days of operation. Nearly all 
researchers using UF have applied tubular membranes, except Konieczny et al. (44), who 15 
 applied flat sheet me mbranes. Flat sheet membranes with low cutoff were reported as easy to 
clean using only deionized water, because only cake formation has happened. For NF and 
RO, the flux can be restored using chemical cleaning for both flat sheet and tubular membranes  (51,52).  In some VSEP systems, only water is needed (52), while in others the use  
of a special blend of surfactants and chelating agents such as NLR 505 and NLR 40467 or citric acid  (81) is recommended. Spiral wound membranes have been used by Mass é et al.  
(62) and Pieters et al.  (37) and are used in full -scale plants in the Netherlands  (31). Massé  et 
al. (62) cleaned the membranes with water for 16 h restoring 94% of the original flux and 
with an alkaline solution for 1 h to reach the original flux. In the ca se of Pieter et al.  (37), the 
latter membrane cleaning was not required because the manure had been microfiltered before and suspended solids thus removed. As presented in Table 5, synthetic membranes for ammonia recovery can be divided into two groups bas ed on their structure (morphology): 
dense and porous membranes. Dense and porous membranes are distinct from each other based  on the size of the separated particles and molecules. Dense membranes are usually 
composed of a thin layer of a dense material rej ecting suspended macromolecules, multivalent 
ions, and monovalent ions (NF, RO), while a  porous membrane retains only suspended solids 
and bacteria (MF, UF) and  viruses and macromolecules in the case of UF. The porous 
membranes take use of screen or depth filtration, where fouling in screen filtration is present  
on the membrane surface and is more accessible for water and cleaning  agents.

 At low pH, NF and RO will retain TAN in ammonium form due to the  rejection of the larger 
counter anions present in manure such as HCO 3−,PO 43−, and VFAs. At higher pH, MD will 
allow TAN in the form of free  ammonia to evaporate through the membrane to be captured in 
an acidic stripping solution. 
The selection of an appropriate method for ammonia recovery has  to take economics into 
consideration. The total cost of the installation  is the sum of total capital investment (TCI) and 
operating costs. TCI includes costs of tanks, separation units (membrane/column), pumps  
(feed/circulation/turbine), compressors, and pretreatment and posttrea tment  methods (39). 
Operating costs contain energy consumption, replacement of equipment, labor costs, and maintenance (39). Energy requirements can be estimated from flow rates, pressure 
differences, cross -flow velocities, and surface areas (39).  
In press ure driven processes such as MF or UF, two types of pumps are employed: Feed 
pumps to pressurize the feed and circulation pumps to control cross -flow velocity in order to 
mitigate concentration polarization and fouling (39). Energy consumption is governed by the 
circulation pumps that deliver high cross -flow velocity, rather than by the feed pump, which 
only has to deliver a relatively low pressure increase for the feed compared to other 
membrane processes (39). The energy requirement of a pump (E
p) can be calculated from 
equation 2, where q v is the flow rate (m3·s−1), η pump efficiency (0.5–0.8) and ΔP pressure 
difference.

Assuming 65% pump efficiency, the approximate energy consumption per 1 m3 of feed have 
been calculated using equations 2 and 3 for the respective membrane technologies based on 
data from selected literature examples. It can be seen from Table 7 that RO and NF have 
energy consumptions of the same magnitude, as those processes are very similar. The energy 
consumption of the total process will be larger as pretreatment steps are necessary prior to NF 
or RO (Table 8). Fuchs et al. (82) reported the energy consumption of RO with a prior UF 
step to be in the range 16–25 kWh m-3. As a comparison, the energy consumption per m3 of 
slurry treated at the Kumac Mineralen  plant is reported to be 9.2 kWh. As 80% of the slurry 
ends in the liquid phase, this equals 12 kWh per m3 of feed to the RO unit or between 0.77 
and 1.3 kWh per kg NH 3 (32). As the data from Kumac Mineralen includes pretreatment and 17 
 post treatment, this tallies well with the estimated energy consumptions and as a rough 
estimate RO consumes 50% of the energy necessary for the ammonia recovery process. In case of the MD, process energy consumption is at least nine times less compared to other membrane proces ses. As this is highly dependent on the pressure drop, the energy 
consumption can be even further reduced by changing the module configuration from capillary to tubular. However, the MD process should not be directly compared with pressure driven membrane processes, because it is more similar to air stripping (AS) based on the working principle. This will be discussed in more detail in the physicochemical methods section.  
Total energy consumption in ED is the sum of electrical energy needed to drive the ionic transfer and pump requirements to run the concentrated and depleted streams and the anode/cathode rinse solutions, meaning that the whole process is rather energetically demanding (39) Unfortunately, insufficient data is available in the literature to m ake an 
energy requirement calculation possible.

Influence of membrane material on process conditions  
Membranes for ammonia recovery can be made from organic or inorganic  materials including 
ceramic and homogeneous organic films (polymers). Ceramic  membranes are formed from 
inorganic materials such as aluminum oxides and sintered titanium. Those membranes are 
very resistant to aggressive media such as acids and organic solvents. They are also very chemically, thermally, and mechanically stable, and biologically inert. The high weight and substantial production costs of ceramic membranes compared to polymeric membranes for some applications are balanced by their long expected lifetime  (83). To our knowledge , 
currently, ceramic materials are only produced in the tight UF range with MWCO down to 
∼450 Da (i.e., Inopor) and additional at much higher prices than polymeric membranes. Thus, 
polymeric materials are the only choice for the time being. Research is ongoing to make 
ceramic membranes for NF and RO, but as yet a commercial breakthrough is waiting  (84,85).  
At present, the polymeric membranes lead the ammonia recovery industry market due to both performance and price.  
Commercial polymers —polysulfone (PSU), PA/PSU, PA, PES, MCE, PP,  PTFE, and 
PVDF —are used industrially for ammonia removal in different  process technologies. 
Nonetheless, the choice of membrane polymer is not  a trivial task. As shown in Table 6, the 
polymer must have appropriate characteristics  for the particular application. In the case of 
MF, UF, NF, and RO  process technologies, the polymer has to be as hydrophilic as possible 
(PA, PSU, PES, MCE) to reduce fouling (39). However,  in the case of MD, the microporous  
membrane should not allow the a queous solution to pass through the membrane pores, hence 
membranes have to be hydrophobic (PP, PTFE, PA/PSU, and PVDF)  (78). Furthermore, all 
polymers have to withstand the harsh cleaning conditions and be chemical resistant for 
solvents and show thermal  stability as well.

Figure 3 Work adhesions as a function of contact angle.  
 
Surface chemistry strongly influences the properties of a membrane such as chemical or thermal resistance. The hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of a membrane can be related to surface free energy, while the presence of ionic charge, and binding affinity for particles in a solution can be expressed as the work adhesion value as shown in Table 6. The hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of membrane surfaces can also be exp ressed in terms of water (liquid) 
contact angle (θ). Hydrophilic (water wetting) membrane surfaces have a contact angle θ in the range of 0 –90
◦ (closer to 0◦), where hydrophobic (not water wetting) materials have θ in 
the range of 90–180◦ (83). Kabsch- Korb utowicz et al. (86) demonstrated that the membrane 
surface free energy and related hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity also influence membrane particle adsorption or fouling phenomena. These conclusions were further supported by the thorough work of Tu et al. (87) Accordingly, Figure 2 shows the relation of surface energy and fouling tendency in ammonia recovery with respect to the surface energy. High -energy surfaces are more hydrophilic and contain polar and/or ionizable groups. Low 
energy surfaces are more hydrophobic and are usually polymers of olefins, fluorocarbons, or minimally substituted aromatics. Although the surface energy provides information about the hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of the membranes, it is not enough to understand the wettability o f the surfaces. In order to have more accurate characterization of membranes 
wettability, the contact angles between the liquid (water) and the membranes were evaluated (Figure 3). It can be seen from Figure 3 that PP membranes have the highest hydrophobic ity, 
while Al
2O3 membranes the lowest.  
Table 6 includes also the values of the proneness to fouling determined by the surface energy of the materials. However the process technology has to be considered as well as the fouling resistance. In case of MF, UF,  NF, and RO, hydrophilic membranes suffer less from fouling. 
In MD, the more hydrophobic the surface the less the risk of wetting, but the more it adsorbs organic particles (88,89).  
Ceramic membranes used in microfiltration show excellent resistance to fou ling (37,90). 
Likewise , PVDF and PSU membranes performed well in UF  (42,44,46).  On the other hand, as 
seen in Table 3 for RO, PA membranes do not show a consistent picture for proneness to fouling. This could be due to varying and insufficient pretreatment  methods and difference in 
degree of hydrophilicity of the PA membranes, as PA exist in different forms  (83). Even the 
most hydrophilic membranes will without proper pretreatment adsorb foulants during long-

 term operation. Higher fouling tendency has also been observed for PES membranes  (45,46). 
For MD, PTFE seems to be even less fouling resistant, though it has only been tested in short -
term operations by Waeger -Baumann and Fuchs  (77). 
The ease of cleaning is also associated with the filtration process and  the surface chemistry of 
the membrane. Table 6 shows the ease of cleaning based on the work adhesion values 
between water and the membrane polymer.  
Figure 3 shows the adhesion forces between the water and the membrane surface. There is a larger affinity b etween water and hydrophilic materials leading to stronger adhesion forces 
being present at the membrane surface. Similarly, less affinity between water and the hydrophobic surface leads to a lower work adhesion value. This explains the relative ease with which PVDF or PSU membranes can be cleaned with deionized water compared to PES, 
where chemical agents have to be applied (42,44,45). Also, PA membranes used in RO have been easy to clean, especially when combined with a VSEP system (52).  Summery on membr ane processes  
It can be concluded that flocculation combined with flotation and filtration or MF and UF are successful methods for removing suspended solids and producing a clear permeate that can be 
used for further ammonia retention by NF, RO, or MD. The  process performance will be 
greatly influenced by and is highly dependent on presence, composition and potential variations in particles, SS and organic material. This emphasizes that NF and RO performance  
depends highly on pretreatment and cleaning methods. From the module comparison, it was found that flat sheet and tubular membranes are the easiest to clean. Furthermore, ceramic membranes are the most fouling resistant, and to a lesser extent PA, MCE, PVDF, and PSU membranes. Correspondingly, ceramic me mbranes are the easiest to clean followed by PA,  
PSU, MCE, and PVDF. Anaerobic digestion of animal wastes reduces manure  solids content 
and particles size, thus the number of necessary pretreatment steps to membrane processes are also reduced  (91). Further more, Flemming and MacAlpine  (58) and Bilstad et al.  (68), 
reported improved permeate quality, higher fluxes, and water recovery while using digested manure compared to raw manure. Without pretreatment, flux through a MF membrane could decrease by 90%, whi le with prefilters the flux remained unchanged for nearly 50 days  (38). 
Inappropriate cleaning with aeration could result in foaming, probably due to the presence of bacteria which excrete extracellular polymers (ECP). ECPs act as surfactants decreasing surface tension and result in foaming (92–95).  However, in a case of piggery wastewater, 
more than 10 s of aeration per 10 min permeation successfully decreased the activity of acid-
forming bacteria.38 It is reported that cleaning MF membranes with water fai led, probably 
because the foulants were trapped inside the membrane, while frequent water cleaning of 
some UF and of some VSEP NF membranes could restore original fluxes in case of cake layer formation. Alkaline cleaning could remove biofouling, while acids or an EDTA solution could remove inorganic fouling. Consecutive cleaning with different cleaning solutions should be applied in order to remove both types of fouling, as shown by Lee et al. (38). 
However, Zhang et al. (45) reported that chemical cleaning with HNO3 and EDTA succeeded 
only in eliminating inorganic compounds. The best MF permeate quality is achieved using cellulose ester membranes, but  the highest flux is obtained using ceramic membranes. In case 
of UF, the  best permeate quality have been achieved using PVDF membranes. PVDF  
membranes also have lower fouling tendency and are easier to clean than  PES membranes. It 
is also noticed that the cut off value of the membranes is  of high importance, as it has been 
report ed by Konieczny et al. (44) that larger  pores in membranes are vulnerable to small 
particles clogging the membrane  pores. This will again affect the cleaning efficiency. VSEP 
in NF has  advantages over cross -flow NF with higher fluxes, less fouling, and bet ter TSS 
retention. Fouling occurs to a lesser extent in VSEP because particles are  not so attached to 21 
 membrane surfaces and vibrations decrease the concentration  polarization and gel layer 
formation  (52). RO can produce concentrate  with TAN 10 g·l−1 and pe rmeate down to 0.02 
g·l−1 TAN. The permeate can  thus be used as sanitary water or if further purified by IE be 
discharged into nature. If colloidal and suspended solids have been eliminated, fouling can be 
reduced by acidifying the slurry prior to RO as this removes carbonates  and additionally 
increases Ca- salt solubility thereby reducing precipitation. Nevertheless, chemical cleaning 
with 1 wt% alkaline detergent is obligatory  to retain the original flux of RO membranes. 
Electrodialysis is another  promisin g technology, which can produce a concentrate with 14 
g·l−1 ammonia.  However, after 2 h of filtration, ion exchanged membranes revealed the 
presence of cracks suggesting fouling which might hinder long- term operation. Moreover, ED 
is a rather energy demand ing process; hence it raises  the power consumption considerably. 
Membrane distillation, as reported by Vanotti and Szogi (76) can in laboratory scale produce 
concentrate with up to at least 53 g·l−1 of ammonia without any pretreatment. On a semi -
industrial  scale, the BioRek concept required anaerobic digestion and ultrafiltration prior to 
MD, but achieved 99.2–99.9% ammonia removal  (23). 
 
Physicochemical Methods 
Air stripping (AS) 
Ammonia can efficiently be removed from slurry by air or steam stripping, as reported by Zeng et al.  (96) The method involves the use of stripping towers, compressors, and pumps, 
which introduce air or steam into the liquid phase. When air stripping is used absorption or adsorption towers are needed to recover ammonia  from the gas phase. For steam stripping, 
condensation, or absorption equipment is needed to recover ammonia, though no further post  
treatment of exhaust gases is  required  (96). Just as in membrane distillation, the amount of 
ammonia that can be recovered depends upon two equilibria:  gas/liquid equilibrium and 
ammonia dissociation equilibrium in the liquid  (97). 
Air stripping or aeration of wastewater has been reported since the beginning of the 20th century  (98), mainly for the purpose of removing noxious compounds from the water. It was 
not until the 70’es that ammonia stripping from wastewater was seriously promoted (99–101 ). 
Large- scale installations were implemented at least 9–10 different places in the United States 
mainly for the purpose of removing ammonia from reject water following dewatering of digested sludge. The ammonia stripped from the water was simply vented to the ambient air. This practice was later abandoned due  to environmental considerations and the units were 
supplied with an absorber unit. Today, ammonia stripping with subsequent absorptions of the stripped ammonia is in use in many countries all over the world. In Germany alone, it is reported that at least 15 full -scale 
stripper/absorber plants are in operation recovering ammonia from wastewater  (102).  
Combined stripper/absorber plants operate basically by heating the wastewater fed to the plant to around 45
◦C and adding NaOH or lime (Ca(OH) 2) until a pH of 10.5– 11 is reached. When 
lime is used, it is normally added in a precipitation tank, which will precipitate carbonates and phosphorous salts before the water is fed to the stripper tower. The recommended volumetric gas/liquid flow rate ratio is 600 –700:1 dependent on the amount of ammonia reduction in the 
process  (102).  A reduction of at least 95% of the ammonia in the feed is then expected. The 
main problem encountered is fouling by scaling of salts in the stripper column, mainly carbonates. This problem i s resolved by frequent cleaning of the packing material. 
Alternatively, a water -sparged aerocyclone (WSA) reactor could be used. This has recently 
been tested for air stripping from wastewater with no evidence of scaling and fouling, probably due to selfcl eaning as a result of strong fluid turbulence in the WSA  (103).  
Regardless of  the air stripping method, the product made in the absorber unit typically is 22 
 ammonia sulfate at a concentration of 28 –30%, which can be sold as a fertilizer to agriculture 
(104–107).  
The efficiency of air stripping depends on four major factors: feed pH, feed temperature, ratio 
of air to feed, and feed characteristics (108,109). The use of lime to raise pH of digested pig manure can lead to precipitation and floc formation. This i s unwanted in a stripping column 
and pretreatment of the slurry after alkalination such as precipitation and sieving is necessary. However, lime is the cheapest alkali source available (discussed later). Further, sieving of suspended solids combined with pH adjustment result in a reduction of total phosphorus (85–93%) and COD (20–48%) in the slurry. This in itself might be of interest as a method for phosphorous recovery (97). In the case of fresh untreated slurry, reduction of total phosphorus was 7.4–12%, and COD (2.8–15%), while in the case of digested manure it was 85–93% and 
20–48%, respectively (97). Those lower reduction values for untreated manure might be explained by a higher organic content and lower settling ability of formed flocs (97). Additionally, Zhang and Jahng (110) concluded that using sodium hydroxide or potassium 
hydroxide is more efficient to raise the pH in piggery wastewater than using lime. Increasing the air flow rate also has a positive effect on ammonia removal due to a decrease o f the 
boundary layer thickness and an increase in mass transfer  (111).  
At a pH above 11.5 and 22
◦C, a removal of 90% ammonia (effluent: NH 4-N 0.1 g·l−1) in 10 l 
of swine wastewater (NH 4-N 0.8 g·l−1) was accomplished in 7 h when operated in batch mode 
with an air flow rate equal to 90 l·min−1. However, at pH 9.5 and with a flow rate of 45 
l·min−1, it required 55 h  (109).  At a lower temperature (15◦C), ammonia removal for 1 l of 
anaerobic digestion effluent (NH 4-N 1.5 g·l−1, COD 2.3 g·l−1) was 95.3% (effluent NH 4-N 
0.04 g·l−1) at an air flow rate of 10 l·min−1 after 12 h  (112).  Likewise, Gustin and Marinsek-
Logar  (113) observed 92.2% ammonia removal efficiency in 2 h from anaerobic digestion 
effluent (NH 4-N 2.2 g·l−1, COD 5.4 g·l−1) at 70◦C and at pH 10, while at 30◦C removal was 
80%. On the other hand, Zhang and Jahng (110) reported only 31–70% ammonia removal 
from piggery wastewater (NH 4-N 5 g·l−1, COD 94.2 g·l−1) at 37◦C and at pH around 10 
resulting in effluent with concentration NH 4-N 1.4–3.4 g·l−1 under aeration rate 0.5 l·min−1 
after 24 h. At a higher temperature of 80◦C and pH 9.5/11.5, the removal efficiency after 4 h 
from fresh pig slurry (NH 4-N 3.4 g·l−1, COD 70.6 g·l−1) was 69% (effluent: NH 4-N 1.05 g·l−1, 
COD 52.2 g·l−1) and 98.8% (effluent : NH 4-N 0.04 g·l−1, COD 49.4 g·l−1), respectively, while 
from digested pig slurry (NH 4-N 3.7 g·l−1, COD 41.2 g·l−1) removal efficiencies were almost 
identical and above 96% (effluent: NH 4-N 0.12 g·l−1, COD 32.6–33 g·l−1) (97). Similarly, 
Laureni  et al.  (108) compared ammonia stripping efficiencies using digested slurries with 
fresh pig slurry. Removal efficiencies above 90% (effluent: NH 4-N 0.1– 0.3 g·l−1) at pH 9.5 
after nearly 4 h were achieved with slurries with initial low organic content (NH 4-N 1–2.7 
g·l−1, COD < 10 g·l−1). The removal efficiency was lower for slurries characterized with COD 
above 27 g·l−1 (NH 4-N 4.2–6- 7 g·l−1). This difference is probably due to binding of 
ammonium ions by organic matter present in the slurry hindering ammoni a stripping  
(114,115).  Results reported by Zeng et al. (96) with digested cattle slurry suggest that steam 
stripping can be operated without preraising pH. This concept is commercially known as the ANAStrip process  (116). This can be explained by a high CO
2 content in the digested slurry 
which is released at high temperature causing a pH increase even though the simultaneous NH
3 release should lead to a pH decrease of the effluent  (96). On the other hand, elevated 
temperatures intensify odor and increase operational costs significantly. It also enhances water evaporation causing a decrease of the ammonia concentration in the effluent. In the case of Zeng et al.  (96), a reported decrease from 120 to 30 mg·l
−1 in the effluent was observed, 
when the temperature increased from 40 to 80◦C. If obtaining a high ammonia concentration 
condensate is the objective, it is thus advisable to use a feed temperature between 50–55◦C 
(96). The role of raising initial pH is essential when fresh untreated pig slurry is used for air 23 
 stripping (97). Similarly, when  swine wastewater was used, below pH 10.5, temperature has 
more influence  on ammonia removal than at pH above 10.5 ( 109).  
Raising the pH to 12 or more requires addition of more lime. In the column, this can result in 
maintenance problems due to calcium carbonate scaling (109). The amount of alkali can be reduced at high temperature due to the higher buffer capacity of manure, which can maintain the desired pH (97). However, one of the biggest challenges is to find chea p energy sources 
(97). Facilitating ammonia removal can be achieved also by increasing the air flow rate. However, it can also create foaming problems if too much air is introduced to manure and it is an expensive solution as recycling of air or steam is e nergy intensive (109).  
The energy consumption of stripper/absorber plants depend on system design including column type (packed or tray) and heat recovery. For instance, Bauermeister et al.  (117) 
reported electric consumption of 2 kWh/m
3 feed, though when including heating up to 80◦C 
the energy consumption increases to 94 kWh/m3 feed. This shows that heat is the major 
contributor to the energy consumption. However, Morales et al. (118) and Jiang et al.  (104) 
reported energy consumptions between 200 and 600 Wh/m3 feed, running the AS process at 
35 and 60◦C, respectively. The estimated electric consumption in this study equals 4.18 
kWh/m3 feed (Table 7) when operating at 50◦C. This lies between values reported by Morales 
et al.  (118),  Jiang et al.  (104) and Ba uermeister et al.  (117).  However, the mentioned authors 
applied packed columns, while in the present study calculations have been made for tray columns. As a consequence, the higher pressure drop encountered in tray columns, resulted in an elevated energy consumption compared to packed columns.  Chemical precipitation  
Ammoniacal nitrogen, phosphate, and magnesium (Mg) can be separated from slurry using chemical precipitation. According to Babic -Ivancic et al. (119) both struvite 
(MgNH
4PO 4·6H 2O) and newberyi te (MgHPO 4·3H2O) are the main precipitates, newberyite 
being formed when magnesium is in surplus (Figure 4).  
They further reported that coprecipitation could occur in the magnesium -phosphorous 
concentration region shown in Figure 4. Babic -Ivancic et al.  (119) investigated the 
morphology of the precipitated struvite and found that struvite might precipitate in at least two distinct crystal forms: dendrite and elongated rod. They further found that the dissolution rate constant was roughly one fourth for elongated crystals compared to dendrite crystals. For precipitations from stoichiometric solutions of Mg
2+, NH 4+, and PO 43− at 25◦C and pH above 
8.5, Bouropoulos and Koutsoukos  (120) reported  precipitation of elongated struvite crystals 
exclusively. If ammonium is to be  removed by precipitation and as a relatively slow release of 
phosphate and ammonium is desired, struvite precipitation should preferably be conducted  
using stoichiometric amounts of magnesium and phosphate at pH above 8.5. As seen from the conditional stability diagram on Figure 5, for most slurry and biogas digestates even though the slurry composition should lead to struvite formation, raising the 
pH may be advantageous to increase struvite formation and to avoid newberyi te formation.  
From a practical point of view, Yilmazel and Demirer (121) carried out struvite precipitation 
from codigested poultry manure and maize digestate. They achieved a 14.6% NH
4+-N 
recovery in the struvite without addition of magnesium and phosphat e. Lab scale experiments 
with codigested dairy and poultry manure or swine wastewater achieved a NH 4+-N recovery 
in the range of 78–95% by struvite precipitation when additional magnesium and phosphate 
are added (121–124). In larger scale, this has been te sted for phosphate recovery from humane 
urine (118).

 Generally, in order to achieve high ammonium removal, additional sources of Mg
2+ (e.g.,  
Mg(OH) 2, MgCl 2 ·6H 2O, MgO, MgSO 4, MgCO 3, and phosphate, for instance [KH 2PO 4]), 
have to be added to manure to balance the high ammonium concentrations (123,125,126). Jeong and Hwang (125) concluded that optimal doses of Mg and P are equivalent to around 
20% of the initial N content. Lee at al. (126) applied bittern and seawater as alternative Mg
2+ 
sources, however it had a negative effect on ammonia removal because of imbal ance in the 
N:P ratio. Optimal conditions for struvite precipitation are pH in a range 9 –10.7 and TSS less 
than 1 g·l−1 (122,127).

 Particu late matter in the manure is also a problem. Uludag -Demirer et al.  (122) have used 
screens with 1.19 mm mesh size to remove coarse solid particles from anaerobically digested 
dairy slurry. Ammonium removal efficiencies were only 56% without removal of TSS from anaerobically digested cattle manure at a PO
43–/NH 4+ ratio of 1.25.124 In the case of dairy 
manure  with high amounts of suspended solids rich in phosphorus, microwave (MW) 
digestion has been implemented to release tied phosphate, ammoniacal nitrogen and metals with efficiencies above 55%. These were then recovered by struvite precipitation.127 This 
treatment enables discharge of nutrients in soluble form and also reduces TSS, which would 
else hinder the struvite precipitation process. Radiation combined with adsorption is similar to 
air stripping, which transfers ammonia from the liquid into the air at high pH, though it 
includes thermal and nonthermal effects instead of conventional heating. This enhances 
ammonia removal (127). It has been found that the concentration of released ammonia by radiation increases with increasing temperature, pH, and longer  MW radiation time (127,128). 
Increased heating temperature in combination with H
2O2 addition also reduces TSS (127). 
However, hydrogen peroxide addition did not maximize ammonia yield (127). Nonetheless, 
full-scale implementation of microwave technology f or ammonia recovery from manure may 
be challenging. Similarly to air stripping, increased temperature would require a higher 
energy input and additionally odor problems may occur. To our knowledge, no full -scale 
experiments have been conducted and this met hod requires further development before it can 
be applied by farmers.  
When calcium ions are used as a pH adjuster for a further air stripping step, they also work as 
precipitants forming CaNH 4PO 4·4H 2O (129). This combined concept has been applied by 
Quan e t al. (129) leading to removal of over 91% of NH 3-N. Higher dosage of Ca(OH) 2 over 
2 g·l−1 at air velocity equals 4.81 m· s−1 resulted in an NH 3-N removal of 94% whereas air 
inlet velocity over 14 m·s−1 with dosage of 3 g·l−1 of Ca(OH) 2 lead to 92% removal.  
Chemical precipitation has an advantage over other ammonia removal processes as it is 
simple to operate. However, the cost is closely related to the price and availability of the chemicals needed and the required product purity. In case of dairy manure, si milar to other 
methods, it requires a pretreatment to remove TSS, leading to a higher investment and operating cost. Additionally, achieving removal of struvite crystals from a mixture of suspended solids depending on the crystal size can be problematic. T herefore , the treated 
liquid will most likely demand further treatment. The specific gravity of struvite (1.6) only slightly exceeds that of common suspended organic solids  (130) and thus centrifugation might 
be necessary to improve precipitate separation  (122).  Struvite must also be sterilized and 
dewatered at 120◦C before applied to fields  (131).  On the otherhand as reported by Shu et al.  
(132),  recovery of 1 kg of struvite per day is sufficient to fertilize 2.6 ha of crop fields 
whereas the average appli cation rate of mineral fertilizers per hectare per year is 119 kg N and 
39 kg P
2O5(133).    
 Ion exchange  
Zeolites are inorganic porous materials well known for their excellent adsorption properties for small molecules and likewise their filtering properties even for highly suspended matter 
effluents (134,135). Ammonium from the liquid manure can be absorbed by a zeolite crystal lattice with a negative excess charge and produce a soil -like material which the authors 
described to have mold- like consistency (136). The solid fraction containing the zeolites can 
be separated from the liquid by a decanter centrifuge . The ammonium -zeolite complex is 
decomposed slowly by the soil bacteria and released to the soil as a nutrient when applied directly to soil ( 136).  
Ammonia removal efficiencies from anaerobic effluent using Ural laumantite  were > 99%. 
However, 1 kg of com pletely saturated Ural laumantite  zeolite contained only 3.6 g of 26 
 ammonia, which is too low and uneconomical  to be used as a fertilizer  (135). Transporting the 
zeolites to the field will add to  process costs and proper regeneration techniques are necessary  
to improve  the economic feasibility of this process  (135). Regeneration of the zeolites was  
suggested by Guo et al. (137) who applied natural clinoptilolite and Na -zeolite  on RO 
permeate of anaerobically digested cattle manure containing nearly  250 mg·l−1 of NH 4+. In 
this case,  regeneration is straightforward. The regeneration cycle consisted of rinsing the 
zeolite filled column with 50 g·l−1 solution of NaCl and 0.2 M of NaOH at flow rates of 2.5–
3.3 bed volume  (BV)/h for about 2.5 h, followed by washing with 1.2 BV of 0.2 M HCl and 1  
BV of deionized water to reach neutral pH.137 Ammonium adsorption capacities  by natural 
zeolite was equal to 0.019 ± 0.002 g·g−1 and by Na -zeolite  0.021 ± 0.001 g·g−1 leading to 71% 
ammonium removal efficiency  (137).  Effectiv e regeneration cycles countered a decrease of 
ammonia removal capacity  and the waste fraction from regeneration needs to be taken into 
account.  A procedure similar to this is used as the final step in full scale at the  Kumac 
Mineralen plant  (32) and the Gebr üderen Verkoyen’s manure separation plant  (34). Milan et 
al. (138) tested potassic zeolite (K -Zeo), magnesic zeolite (Mg-Zeo), sodic zeolite (Na- Zeo), 
and calcic zeolite (Ca- Zeo) for ammonia  removal from digested piggery manure after 
screening through a 2 mm sieve. During the first 10 h of operation, ammoniacal nitrogen 
removal efficiency  using Na -Zeo was equal to 91%, while using Ca -Zeo it was 75%  (138).  
However,  over the next 10 h, the removal efficiency dropped to 58.3% for Na -Zeo and  to 
36.7% for Ca -Zeo. Theoretically, Mg -Zeo should facilitate ammonia exchange better than Na-
Zeo due to its crystalline structure, though in practice  ion exchange is impeded by the high 
suspended solids content and viscosity of the manure, and competition between Mg2+ and 
Ca2+ in the liquid phase  (138).  Therefore, IE would require pretreatment at least with UF to 
remove  suspended solids before it could be applied and also to avoid clogging of the 
adsorption column. Ammonia removal is also dependent on the bed height. This is probably 
due to a combination of liquid dispersion which  influence the breakthrough curve for the 
column and suspended solids removal  at the column entrance that would otherwise inhibit the 
adsorption process  (138).  Nevertheless, large column h eights lead to an increased pressure  
drop over the column and thus increased operating costs and capital cost of  the process. It 
thus requires careful further analysis to determine the optimal column height to cross 
sectional area ratio.

Comparison of Physicochemical Methods  
The physicochemical methods have been compared based on estimated chemical costs (Figure 6) and energy consumption in kWh per 1 kg of ammonia removed. As basis ammonia recovery from 1 m3 of undigested pig manure effluent from UF, containing 1.4 g·l
−1 NH 4-N 
was used  (44). Both air stripping and chemical precipitation require prior pH adjustment. 
Lime is the cheapest pH adjuster compared to sodium hydroxide and pot assium hydroxide 
based on chemical cost alone, though its usage is avoided especially in air stripping due to scaling problems. Alkaline requirements for AS (2.2 kg CaO m
−3; 6.44 kg NaOH m−3, 7.43 kg 
KOH m−3) to raise pH of swine wastewater have been taken  from Liao et al.  (109) and Zhang 
et al.  (110),  while for CP (6 kg NaOH m−3) from Ryu and Lee  (123).  
Total cost of chemicals for AS using sodium hydroxide and 30 wt% sulfuric acid is equal to 3.5 $/m
3feed, whereas the cost is 1.1 $/m3feed using lime and 30 wt% sulfuric acid. For 
struvite formation, additional sources of magnesium and phosphate ions are required to balance the ammonia present in the feed. Both magnesium oxide and magnesium hydroxide can at the same time increase solution pH, but as they diss olve slowly in water vigorous 
mixing and long reaction time is needed (124).  Magnesium chloride commonly applied for 
struvite formation dissolves fast in water, magnesium sulfate slightly slower. A drawback though is that additional alkaline agents are nee ded to raise pH (124). Even though 
magnesium carbonate is cheaper than magnesium chloride, it is not advisable for ammonia recovery due to its insolubility in water. As a phosphate source, sodium phosphate dibasic is suggested because it is three times cheaper than potassium phosphate monobasic. Based on this, the total chemical cost for CP including MgCl
2·6H 2O, Na 2HPO 4 and NaOH is equal to 
12.9 $/m3feed. The cost of zeolites for ion exchange is lower compared to the prices on 28 
 chemicals for struvite precipi tation. The IE process though also requires zeolite regeneration 
with NaCl (50 g·l−1, 2.5 BV·h−1) and NaOH (0.2 M, 2.5 BV·h−1), followed by washing with 
HCl (0.2M, 1.2 BV·h−1) (137).  Regeneration with NaCl, NaOH, and HCl increases the total 
cost of chemicals for ammonia recovery to 8.7 $/m3feed.  
To calculate energy requirements of the physicochemical methods for a 95% removal of 
ammonia from 1 m3 of UF effluent, the assumptions stated in Table 9 had to be made.  
The less energy demanding processes are IE, CP, and MD, as the processes consume 0.04, 
0.63, and 0.18 kWh/kgNH 3, respectively, while AS has the highest energy requirement, 
almost 3.1 kWh/kgNH 3 (Table 7). The MD process is similar to AS, and energy consumption 
has been recalculated based on ammonia f lux and was found to be nearly 18 times lower than 
for AS (Table 7). Both AS and MD energy consumptions are related to the pressure drop. In 
the case of MD, optimization can be achieved as mentioned in the membrane processes section by changing from capill ary to tubular membranes. In case of AS, using packed 
columns would lead to a decrease of pressure drop, though the risk of clogging the packing material is also higher.  
The operating costs of the physicochemical methods are presented in Table 8. It is concluded that CP with a cost 13.0 US$/m
3 of feed is the most expensive technology for recovery of 
ammonia. This is in agreement with Janus et al.  (139) conclusions. Ion exchange despite low 
energy demand is also costly (9.3 US$/m3feed) because it requires pr ior suspended solids 
removal by at least UF and zeolite regeneration. AS seems to be the less expensive (3.8 US$/m
3feed when NaOH is used or 1.4 US$/m3feed when lime is used). This cost is similar to 
MD combined with UF (3.7–4.1 US$/m3feed when NaOH is use d or 1.3–1.7 US$/m3feed 
when lime is used). In both processes, the chemical costs are the same, as AS and MD require 
alkaline addition (NaOH or lime) and an absorption solution (e.g., H 2SO 4). Moreover, it is 
also found that energy consumption of the blower  necessary for AS is similar to the energy 
consumption of UF necessary for MD. If MD however is applied without UF, then the 
operating cost is lower: 3.5 or 1.12 US$/m3feed (if NaOH or lime is applied, respectively). As 
the ammonia mass transfer is at leas t 1.5 lower for untreated manure compared to UF treated 
manure  (77), a higher membrane area is required, hence increasing the membrane cost.  It is 
also expected that membranes would demand more frequent cleaning and replacement, 
because the probability of organic fouling especially by proteins is also higher for untreated 
manure than for UF treated manure (140).  
 Summ ary of physicochemical methods  
Most of the physicochemical methods compared to membrane processes are relatively easy to perform and additiona lly do not require many man hours or much energy. All the processes 
will be greatly influenced by the presence and nature of particles, SS and organic matter as in the case for membrane processes. Chemical precipitation produces solid products that can be transported over long distances after sterilization and dewatering. In case of ammonium bound to zeolites, transport seems to be rather expensive and a way to regenerate the zeolites is needed for the process to be of enduring usage. Comparing MD with air stripping, which both produce liquid ammonium sulfate, the energy consumption for MD is 18 times lower than for AS. The operating cost of AS though is similar to MD when combined with UF. Running MD without UF pretreatment seems advantageous as this reduce s the costs. This 
prospective advantage though may be more than offset by expenses for membrane 
replacement and membrane cleaning, as  fouling is expected to be a problem for MD, when 
treating raw manure (140).  As information on full -scale running MD plants  and long- term 
operation are presently missing, these factors can at the moment only be inferred.  
Air stripping achieves better ammonia recovery (above 95%) for anaerobically digested manure, which is probably due to higher buffering capacity and lower COD . It is advisable in 29 
 air stripping to use low temperature and increase pH. This reduces operational costs and odor 
problems. Too high pH though can lead to scaling problems. The least expensive method to recover ammonia is AS. UF/IE is the most expensive due to the high chemical costs and elevated energy consumption. Furthermore, CP is expensive because of high chemical costs, albeit at the same time it binds phosphorous. This might alleviate the extra expenditure on chemicals, but the obtainable quality of  struvite and also treated liquid as well as removal 
efficiency still calls for more research in order to have a well -known process. 
  
Comparison of ammonia recovery technologies  
Table 10 compares the different technologies suggested for the ammonia  recovery in terms of 
best permeate/concentrate quality, ease of maintenance and operational cost. 
From a farmer’s point of view, the applied technology should be relatively  simple to operate, 
be robust, and require low investment and maintenance  costs. In m embrane processes, easy, 
low cost but effective cleaning is  very important, and methods without the need of chemicals 
and subsequent  waste handling are highly preferable due to economy and safe operation of the 
plant. Profitability of membrane processes is  also highly dependent  upon a necessary feed 
pretreatment to circumvent fouling and chemical cost  to ensure ammonia/ammonium 
retention. On centralized manure separation  plants, RO has proved itself to be a viable process 
when combined with flocculation, aeration and filtration as pretreatment and IE as 
posttreatment (31,32).  On the farm level when NF or RO is combined with UF as 
pretreatment, the  process requires more energy, based on the calculations presented in this  
paper. Still compared to the other technologies, it should be less expensive  (Table 8). The cost 
of sulfuric acid to acidify manure is comparable to the  cost of UF prior to NF or RO. 
However, it is expected that membrane cleaning  and replacement will be more frequent due to 
fouling. This increase s the  total operational cost. Furthermore, from a farmer’s point of view 
running UF prior to NF or RO may be a rather challenging task. Thus, delivering the  manure 
to centralized separation plants could be the preferred solution. Another promising technology is VSEP NF or RO as the membranes suffer  less from fouling 
during filtration of centrifuged pig manure, compared to other cross -flow NF or RO filtration 
systems. Unfortunately, the ammonia  removal efficiency data for VSEP NF/RO are not 
reported in literatu re. Recovery  of the original flux of a VSEP NF polyamide membrane, with 
deionized  water alone was possible, as reported by Kertesz et al.  (52) Evaluating the process  
economy would require further work mainly due to lack of ammonia  recovery data and 
energy consumption.  
Operating AS or UF/MD is mor e expensive contrary to UF/NF or UF/RO  when NaOH (2.5 
US$/m
3feed) is used to increase manure pH, while when  using lime (0.1 US$/m3feed) the cost 
is similar. However,  in the latter case,  the risk of scaling in case of AS or fouling in case of 
MD is also in creased  due to complex formation between calcium and organics  (140). 
Nonetheless,  it should be tested on a long- term basis before implementing the concept  on 
farms. This would allow for optimizing cleaning procedures and simultaneously test the 
longtime memb rane hydrophobicity. Air stripping at low  temperatures succeeds in removing 
90% of ammonia from raw manure and 95.3% from anaerobically digested manure. Chemical 
precipitation has a low  energy demand but is at the same time the most expensive in 
chemicals . The treated liquid also needs to be processed further before discharge or  reuse as 
the removal is too low. Moreover, it cannot be applied successfully for dairy manure due to 
high TSS, which hinders precipitation. Likewise, ion exchange on its own has fa iled to be a 
viable technology for ammonia removal, because it is expensive and 1 kg of Na zeolite 
adsorbed only 21 g of  ammonia  (137).  This is also due to further processing costs of the 30 
 regeneration  liquid, if the IE adsorbent is to be reused. It is though a viable process as  post 
treatment of RO permeates before discharge to the surroundings  (31,32).

From a farmer ’s point of view, the applied technology should be relatively simple to operate 
and require low investment cost.  RO does not fulfill those requirements, since necessary pretreatment makes it expensive . 
Much better results have been obtained using VSEP NF polyamide membrane, that suffer less from fouling compared to cross flow filtration like NF or RO. To restore the original flux 
cleaning with deionized water is sufficient. Another  promising technology seems to be 
membrane contactors. As reported by Vanotti et al. (71), it is possible to produce concentrate s 
with TAN 53 g/L without any pretreatment. However, it should be tested on a long term basis before implementing the concept  on farms. Air stripping is the biggest membrane rival, 
removing 90% of ammonia from raw wastes and 96% from anaerobically digested manure at low temperature. The cheapest method and at the same time the easiest is a chemical 
precipitation. However, it cannot be applied successfully for dairy manure due to TSS, which hinders precipitation. Likewise ion exchange has failed to be viable technology for ammonia removal , since 1 kg of zeolite contained only 3.6 g of ammonia (91) . 
 
CONCLUSIONS   
From an operational cost comparison (Table 8), it is concluded that at present  NF, RO, MD 
combined with UF, and AS are worth considering to concentrate and recover ammonia 
fertilizer from manure. AS can produce 28–30 wt% of  ammonia sulfate, requiring 3.1 kWh/kg 
NH3. This will cost 1.4 US$/m3feed or 3.5 US$/m3feed depending on the applied base lime or  
NaOH ( 104–107 ). Among pressure driven membrane processes, energy demands for NF and  
RO were found to be 2.2 kWh/m3feed and between 4.3–5.5 kWh/m3feed,  respectively. Taking 
into account UF pretreatment for NF and RO, this technology would cost 1.0–1.5 US$/m3feed 
or 1.2–1- 6 US$/m3feed respectively.  It is also found that VSEP NF/RO is a promising 32 
 technology for ammonia  removal due to less proneness to fouling compared to other pressure 
driven membrane processes. MD has though the potential to become a rival for AS,  RO, and 
NF. The MD cost mainly depends on the alkaline used for raising pH as the energy cost is 
relatively low. Running the process without UF  would cost only 1.1 US$/m3feed compared to 
1.3–1.7 US$/m3feed when  UF permeate is used as feed. Nevert heless, long- term experiments 
should be  conducted to conclude whether frequent chemical cleaning when treating raw 
manure would be less expensive than pretreatment with UF. Furthermore, the membrane 
material and configuration have a large impact on  fouling tendency and cleaning efficiency 
for MF, UF, NF and RO. Therefore, tubular/flat sheet membranes fabricated from highly 
hydrophilic materials  like PA, PSU, MCE, and PVDF should be used. Energy requirement for 
a 95% removal of ammonia from 1 m3 of UF effluent is lower for IE (0.04  kWh/kgNH 3) 
compared to MD that requires 0.18 kWh/kgNH 3, while CP has  a higher energy requirement of 
0.63 kWh/kgNH 3. Additionally, the total cost  of chemicals is estimated for CP to equal 12.9 
$/m3feed, for AS 3.5 $/m3feed when NaOH is used or 1.1 $/m3feed when lime is applied and 
for IE 8.7 $/m3feed. Among all methods for ammonia removal, AS and CP only require  prior  
removal of suspended solids, while all the others require pretreatment  with UF followed by 
cleaning/regeneration cycles.
