MicroplasticsDeep seaSedimentPollutionabstract
Microplastics are small plastic particles ( <1 mm) originating from the degradation of larger plastic
debris. These microplastics have been accumulating in the marine environment for decades and havebeen detected throughout the water column and in sublittoral and beach sediments worldwide. How-
ever, up to now, it has never been established whether microplastic presence in sediments is limited to
accumulation hot spots such as the continental shelf, or whether they are also present in deep-seasediments. Here we show, for the ﬁrst time ever, that microplastics have indeed reached the most
remote of marine environments: the deep sea. We found plastic particles sized in the micrometre range
in deep-sea sediments collected at four locations representing different deep-sea habitats ranging indepth from 1100 to 5000 m. Our results demonstrate that microplastic pollution has spread throughoutthe world ’s seas and oceans, into the remote and largely unknown deep sea.

1. Introduction
The world ’s seas and oceans are subjected to different kinds of
threats of which the accumulation of anthropogenic debris is a
major and worldwide problem that has been an environmental
concern for decades. Despite the increased international attention,
the build-up of these materials in the environment is considered
problematic due to the increasing global plastic production
(280 million tons y/C01in 2011 ( PlasticsEurope, 2012 )) and the
continuing improper disposal of plastic waste. In the last decade ithas been demonstrated that in the marine environment such large
plastic items will break up into smaller fragments ( Andrady, 2011;
Cole et al., 2011 ) with dimensions as small as a few micrometre, the
so called microplastics. Moreover, additional sources of micro-
plastics have been identi ﬁed: microplastic particles present in
cosmetics ( Fendall and Sewell, 2009 ) and microplastic ﬁbres from
fabrics such as polyester and polyamide ( Browne et al., 2011;
Dubaish and Liebezeit, 2013 ) present in domestic wastewater are
not retained during sewage treatment and can thus enter the ma-
rine environment.
Many authors have de ﬁned microplastics as particles smaller
than 5 mm ( Arthur et al., 2009 ), while others have set the upper
size limit at 1 mm ( Claessens et al., 2011 ). While the value of 5 mmis more commonly used, 1 mm is a more intuitive value (i.e. ‘micro ’
refers to the micrometre range). Most plastic present in the marine
environment ﬁts these small size classes. For instance, plastic par-
ticles<1 mm accounted for 65% of all marine debris items collected
on beaches in the Tamar Estuary (U.K.) ( Browne et al., 2010 ).
Because of these small dimensions, microplastics become available
for ingestion by organisms commonly not affected by the larger
marine debris. Short-term laboratory trails have shown that marine
invertebrates, representing different feeding strategies, can ingest
these microscopic plastic particles. Polychaetes, bivalves, echino-derms and copepods will all, in at least one life stage, take up
microplastics from the environment ( Cole et al., 2013; Graham and
Thompson, 2009; Thompson et al., 2004; Ward and Shumway,
2004 ). Once ingested, these microplastics can either be elimi-
nated through defecation or retained in the tissues of the exposed
animals (called translocation) ( Browne et al., 2008; von Moos et al.,
2012 ). Since there is a data gap concerning chronic effects of
microplastic exposure, the implications of microplastic contami-
nation in the marine environment are, to date, unknown.
Microplastics have been reported in the water column and
marine sediments worldwide ( Claessens et al., 2011; Law et al.,
2010; Moore et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 2004 ), from low, back-
ground concentrations of 3 particles m
/C03in water ( Doyle et al.,
2011 ) and 8 particles kg/C01in sediment ( Thompson et al., 2004 ),
to very high, hot-spot concentrations of 102 000 particles m/C03in
water ( Norén and Naustvoll, 2010 ) and 621 000 particles kg/C01in
sediments ( Liebezeit and Dubaish, 2012 ). The observed sediment*Corresponding author.

shelf. However, accumulation zones of ﬂoating plastic debris and
associated microplastics, the so-called garbage patches, are located
far from any continental margin. Hence, the question arises
whether the degradation products of larger marine debris are
present in deep-sea sediments as well, since surface particulate
material can be rapidly exported to abyssal depths.
Here, we investigate the presence of microplastics in one of the
most pristine of marine environments: the deep sea. To explore the
hypothesis that microplastics have entered the deep sea, sediment
samples from deep-sea locations worldwide were analysed for the
presence of microplastics by means of a new and highly ef ﬁcient
extraction technique using a high density salt solution.2. Materials & methods
Microplastic extractions were performed on 11 sediments samples originating
from several locations in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea ranging in depth
from 1176 to 4844 m (see Table 1 ). These deep sea systems represent different
marine environments. The three sampling stations in the Atlantic sector of theSouthern Ocean, off the polar front were representative for a pristine environment,since the sea ﬂoor of this remote location is still largely unexplored and assumed
void of pollution. In the Northern Atlantic Ocean, the Porcupine Abyssal Plain wassampled. This site is characterised by large seasonal variations in the ﬂux of par-
ticulate organic matter (POM) derived from surface production ( Lampitt et al., 2001 ).
The distal lobe of the Congo Canyon (Gulf of Guinea, South Atlantic Ocean) is fuelled
by organic matter delivered by one of the world ’s largest rivers, the Congo River
(Khripounoff et al., 2003 ). The last sampling location is shallower and situated off
the Nile Deep Sea Fan adjacent to the Amon Mud volcano in the Eastern Mediter-ranean Sea. This is an area on the Egyptian margin characterised by strong sedi-mentation, and in ﬂuenced by the burial of thick accumulations of organic-rich
sediments and the formation of hydrocarbons ( Felden et al., 2013 ).
Each time a surface area of 25 cm
2was sampled. Immediately after recovery, the
cores were cut into horizontal slices by extruding it into a ring and slicing thesediment with a metal plate. The cores were cut into 1-cm-thick slices. Only the topcentimetre of the sediment cores were analysed for the presence of microplastics.The extraction was performed according to Claessens et al. (2013 ), with minor
modi ﬁcations. Since the deep-sea sediment core samples represented only a small
volume (25 cm
3), no volume reduction of the sample by elutriation was performed.
Instead, sediment samples were wet sieved, ﬁrst on a 1 mm mesh sieve and sub-
sequently on a 35 mm mesh sieve. The fraction remaining on the 35 mm sieve was
used for a further extraction based on density ﬂotation using sodium iodide (den-
sity: 1.6 g cm/C03), as described in Claessens et al. (2013 ). The entire extraction process
was performed with instruments that were rinsed with ﬁltered deionised water
(0.8mm membrane ﬁlter, GelmanScience) and in a clean fume hood, in order to
prevent contamination with airborne microplastics.
The particles that were classi ﬁed as possible microplastics were analysed using
micro-Raman spectroscopy. The spectra of the particles were recorded with a Bruker
Optics ‘Senterra ’dispersive Raman spectrometer coupled with an Olympus BX51
microscope. The system used a thermoelectrically cooled charge-coupled device(CCD) detector. The instrument was controlled via the OPUS 6.5.6 software.
3. Results & discussion
In three of the four locations studied, microplastics were
recovered from the top 1 cm of the sediment samples (see Fig. 1 ). In
total, ﬁve particles were identi ﬁed as possible microplastics: 1
particle originating from the Nile Deep Sea Fan,1 from the Southern
ocean, and three particles from the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. NoTable 1

(limited) surface sampled it can tentatively be concluded that in/on
the sea ﬂoor of the deep sea, microplastics can reach an average
abundance of 0.5 microplastics per 25 cm2(N¼11) in the topcentimetre of sediment. The highest concentration of microplastics
was encountered in the sediment of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain:
here, microplastics reached an average concentration of 1 particle

Van Cauwenberghe et al. / Environmental Pollution 182 (2013) 495 e499 497microplastics were recovered from the location off the Congo and
Nile rivers, since these rivers pass through countries that lack
adequate waste management. Because of the small sample sizes
(only two to three cores per location) and the small volumes per
core, the fact that no microplastics were encountered does not
imply that no microplastics were present at all. In addition, due to
the high organic content of the samples originating from the Congo
Canyon the ﬁlters contained high amounts of organic (plant) ma-
terial that impeded the visual inspection for microplastics. It is thus
possible that microplastics present in these samples were missed.
The sampling stations in the Mediterranean are located near the
edge of the Nile Delta Fan, where we would expect a reduced
riverine input.
The characterisation of the extracted particles involved mea-
surement of both length and width, and an identi ﬁcation of the
plastic component using micro-Raman spectroscopy. The size of
observed particles ranged from 75 mmt o1 6 1 mm at their largest
cross-section (see Table 2 ). Additionally, some scanning electron
microscopy images were made of three microplastics, to get a
better idea of the surface morphology of these particles (see Fig. 2 ).
Allﬁve particles had distinct colouring (see Fig. 1 ). The presence of
these pigments in the particles interfered with the measurements
of the plastic type, and as a result the spectra obtained were these
for the pigments, not those for the plastic type (see Fig. 3 ). Three
different pigments were measured: copper phthalocyanine (blue
pigment), polychloro copper phthalocyanine (green pigment) and
permanent red (red pigment). These are organic pigments with a
non-natural origin, indicating the presence of anthropogenic par-
ticles in these samples. Additionally, these pigments are most
commonly used in the plastics industry ( Lewis, 2004 ), which
strengthens the assumption that these particles are microplastics.
Plastics are relatively new materials, and as have only been
produced for the past 60 years. Despite their young age, plastics
have already invaded most marine habitats, and even the most
pristine of environments, the Arctic deep sea is not been spared, as
Bergmann and Klages (2012 ) recently demonstrated. The sea ﬂoor
is considered as a sink for much of the marine plastics ( Goldberg,
1997 ), but the mechanisms by which these materials reach the
deep sea ﬂoor, however, are still poorly understood ( Gregory,
2009 ). For larger plastic debris, the heavy fouling of ﬂoating plas-
tics is a possible mechanism, as it increases density so that they sink
to the sea ﬂoor. Microplastics, on the other hand could reach the sea
ﬂoor as marine snow. This marine snow is produced as a biologi-
cally enhanced aggregation of small particles ( Alldredge and Silver,
1988 ). These microaggregates normally contain phytoplankton,
organic debris and clay particles which adhere together through
the action of extracellular polymeric material exuded by living or
dead cells. Sinking rates of marine snow are estimated to range
from 1 to 368 m d/C01(Alldredge and Silver, 1988 ). The depths of the
deep-sea sampling locations in this study could thus have been
reached within a couple of days or after several years. Through the
incorporation of microplastics in these microaggregates, even low-
density plastic particles (such as polyethylene and polypropylene)
that normally ﬂoat on the sea surface can be transported to the sea
ﬂoor. As such, it is hard to make any prediction on the plastic type
(i.e. low-density vs. high-density plastic) of the recovered micro-plastics. Since the extraction technique was based on ﬂotation us-
ing a 1.6 g cm
/C03solution, we can state that the deep-sea
microplastics must a have a similar or lower density. Most
commercially available plastics, however, meet this speci ﬁcation.
We were able to show, for the ﬁrst time ever, that microplastics
are present in the top sediment layer of the deep-sea ﬂoor. Up to
now, however, no conclusive statements can be made on how these
microscopic particles were transported from the surface to the
bottom of the oceans. Yet, their presence indicates thatmicroplastics have invaded the marine environment to an extent
that they appear to be present throughout the world ’s oceans and
seas, including abyssal depths.
