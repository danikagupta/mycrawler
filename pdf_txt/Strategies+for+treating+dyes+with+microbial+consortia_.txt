During the past few decades, water resources are getting scarcer 
due to exponential increase in population, agriculture, urbanization 
and industrialization.1–4 Different industrial sectors entail significant 
environmental and public health concerns. One such industry is 
textile dyeing which is one of the most water-intensive industries 
and generates releases consisting of recalcitrant organic molecules 
generally, problems of color, high concentrations of Biological 
Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), fibers, 
surfactants, detergents and solvents.5 Textile industries consume huge 
volumes of freshwater for its various wet processes and release equal 
amounts of wastewaters.6 During the dyeing process, not all the dyes 
are fixed to the fabrics. There is always a portion of unfixed dye which 
is discharged into the wastewater that forms the major pollutant in 
this effluent. Textile market utilize more than half of world dye 
and organic pigment, and the demand is expected to increase more 
than $30 billion in 2019.7 Different types of dyes are used in textile 
industries, the most commonly frequent dyes applied in dyeing units 
are azo dyes. Apart from textile industry, they are also used in tannery, 
paper and pulp, pharmaceutical, food, paint, plastics, cosmetics and 
electroplating industries.8 The improper discharge of colored dye 
effluents into natural water bodies severely affects all living forms 
and causes aesthetical unpleasantness creating a significant problem 
to human being.9,10 Removal of dyes from effluent has been given a 
top priority. Several physico-chemical methods have been employed 
but they have facing several problems, such as generation of toxic 
by-products and economical unfeasibility.10,11 Bioremediation has 
become a very special challenge since it is cost-effective, eco-friendly 
and does not produce a large quantity of sludge.12 Several studies have 
focused on the utilization of pure culture to decolorize synthetic dyes. 
Due to the chemical complexity of these dyes, it is necessary to develop 
more efficient microbial processes for decolorization.10 Recently, 
trend is shifting towards use of microbial consortia. Several microbial 
consortia have been reported for efficient dye removal.13 In this study the main aim is to emphasize on the existing literature on microbial 
decolorization of TWWs using co-cultivated microorganisms.
Overview of textile wastewaters and textile 
dyes
Characteristics of textile wastewaters
Textile dyeing industries are facing problems to meet the green 
practices standards for safe discharge of wastewater due to its 
complex nature. TWWs are a complex mixture of salts, acids, heavy 
metals, organ-chlorine-based pesticides, pigments and dyes.5,10 
TWWs generated from the different wet processes are characterized 
by high pH, temperature, BOD, COD, detergents, surfactants, 
suspended and dissolved solids, dispersants, leveling agents, toxic 
organics, chlorinated compounds, sulphide and formaldehyde, may be 
added to improve dye adsorption onto the fibers9 and more details are 
mentioned in the Figure 1. Such effluents are also characterized by the 
presence of heavy metals, such as Cr, Zn, Cu and Al due to metal-based 
complexes dyes.10,14 The most common textile operates are desizing, 
bleaching, mercerizing, dyeing and finishing.15 Characteristics and 
the amount of TWWs depend to the process, dyeing is the most 
one which requires large volumes of water not only in the step of 
adding color to the fibers, in dye bath, but also during the rinsing step. 
Mercerizing and finishing are also significant generators of TWWs. In 
addition, equipment, machines and chemicals,5 such as detergents and 
stabilizers, alter significantly the nature of TWWs. Another important 
factor which contributes to the ecotoxicity and the volume of TWWs 
is that dyeing and finishing processes, especially, require the imput 
of a wide range of dyestuffs. The Variety of dyes depends to the fiber 
used.16 For example, cellulose fiber requires the application of direct, 
reactive, vat, azo or sulfide dyes. Acid dyes are used essentially for 
wool and silk. Azo and disperse dyes are applied to the polyester fiber. 
A large quantity of these dyes is released in the TWWs due to their 
degree of fixation to fibers.

 Received: April 23, 2019 | Published: May 10, 2019Abstract
The textile wastewaters (TWWs) are one of the major sources of environmental 
pollution, due to the presence of various recalcitrant dyes. It is estimated that about 
300,000 t of synthetic dyes are discharged in TWWs every year worldwide. Thus, 
untreated or incompletely treated TWWs cause harm to aquatic and terrestrial life. 
To avoid the negative impacts associated to the discharge of TWWs into the natural 
ecosystems, effective dye remediation processes are being developed. Current methods 
of removing dyes from TWWs are generally regarded to be complex, expensive and 
energy demanding processes. Therefore, bioremediation of TWWs using microbial 
consortia has appeared as an emerging alternative for textile dyes removal. This 
chapter provides an updated literature on the application of microbial consortia in the 
treatment of TWWs, focusing on the mechanisms involved in dye biodegradation and 
the main interactions established between the consortia members and how they can 
influence dye removal efficiencies.

According to Witt theory, dyes have a chromophore group which 
imparts color to the dye and auxochromes to intensify the color when 
introduced into a colored molecule. The most important auxochromes 
are amine (–NH3), carboxyl (–COOH), sulfonate (–SO3H) and 
hydroxyl (-OH).17 Based on the method of application, main classes 
of dyes are: acid, basic, direct, reactive, disperse, vat, mordant and 
sulphur18,19 and according to the chemical structure and the type of the 
chromophore present in the molecule, the most important classes, as 
indicated in Table 1, are azo, anthraquinone, nitro and other dyes. Azo 
dyes account for over 50% of commercial dyes available in the market 
and constitute the most important class applied in textile processing 
industries.14  The first azo dye, Aniline Yellow was reported in 1858 
by Griss. More than 10,000 dyes are available commercially and 
more than 7×105 tons of dyestuffs are produced annually.9,20 Azo dyes 
are characterized by the presence of one or more azo groups (R1-
N=N-R2), the persistence and the stability against microbial attack.
Environmental and health impacts of textile 
wastewaters
The release of TWWs causes dark coloration of surface waters that 
captures the attention of both the public and the authorities. During 
textile processing, a large amount of dyestuff is liberated directly in the 
effluent due to inefficiencies in dyeing step. In addition, dyes absorb light in the visible range, being detectable even at a concentration 
of 1 ppm.14 Apart from the aesthetic unpleasantness, the main 
environmental concern with the dyes is their absorption and reflection 
of sunlight penetration, which, in turn, decreases photosynthetic 
activity and dissolved oxygen amount in the water, and affects aquatic 
flora and fauna.10,21,22 Several reports have indicated that direct and 
indirect toxic effects of the dyes and TWWs can cause tumors, cancers 
and allergies in humans.10,23,24 Due to their persistence nature, azo dyes 
have negative impact on the environment in terms of total organic 
carbon (TOC), COD and BOD.25 Many synthetic dyes and their 
metabolic intermediate products are found to be toxic, mutagenic and 
carcinogenic.26,27 The Major toxic effects of azo dyes are caused by 
aromatic amines generated after their biodegradation. Also, there are a 
large group of aromatic amines which are either cancer-suspect agents 
or established mutagens in the standard Salmonella mutagenicity 
assay.28 Some azo dyes can be carcinogenic without being cleaved 
into aromatic amines. However, the carcinogenicity of many azo dyes 
is due to their cleaved product such as benzidine. Benzidine induces 
different human and animal tumors. Another azo dye component 
p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA) is a contact allergen.29 Reports are 
also available on other important dyes including triphenylmethane 
and anthraquinone which have been shown negative impacts.12,30,31 
Some dyes from the triphenylmethane group have been reported to be 
toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic.30,31 More details about impacts of 
TWWs are indicated in Figure 1.

Different treatments of textile wastewaters
Considering the several hazards of dyes, their removal before 
their discharge into surrounding environment is urgent. So, many 
technologies have been developed to achieve an efficient and 
economic treatment. They can be physical, chemical or biological.
Physico-chemical methods
During the past two decades, several physicochemical decolorization 
techniques, such as coagulation-flocculation, adsorption, oxidation 
and membrane techniques, have been reported.32 Physical methods 
are mainly used for the primary treatment of TWWs.20 Based on 
coagulation–flocculation of dyes, they are effective for the removal of 
mainly sulphur and disperse dyes, but show very low capacity for acid, 
direct, reactive and vat dyes.21 Although activated carbon is a very 
effective adsorbent for various types of dyes, it is not often used due 
to its high cost and removal pH dependent but it is capable of treating 
only small effluent volume, operates at slow speed.33 For Chemical 
treatments, excess use of chemicals requires high cost and results into 
secondary pollution.34 These methods can only transfer the dyestuff 
from one phase to another leaving the problem essentially unsolved. 
Briefly, their continuous application put forth their limitations as it is 
detailed in Figure 2, giving the relay to biological treatment.
Biological treatment
Biological processes provide an alternative to existing technologies 
for many purposes (Figure 2). Several microbial sources have been 
reported including fungi, bacteria, yeasts, algae and actinomycetes.21 Extremophilic microorganisms are widely applied in TWWs 
treatment due to their ability to survive in such harsh condition 
which poses a limiting factor for mesophilic microorganisms.35,36 
Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria show also interesting ability 
to decolorize various textile dyes.37,38 These bioprocesses can be 
classified, on the basis of oxygen requirement, into aerobic, anaerobic 
and anoxic or facultative or a combination of these.39 And they are 
based on the enzymes synthesized by microorganisms40,41 or whole 
cells. The effectiveness of microbial decolorization depends on the 
adaptability and the activity of selected microorganisms enhanced 
by its application under optimal conditions.42 This decolorization can 
be achieved through individual and specific strain or co-cultivated 
microorganisms.
Pure culture
Bacterial pure culture: There are many published studies dealing 
with the use of pure cultures in decolorization process (Table 2). 
Therefore, a large number of microorganisms and enzymes have been 
isolated. Among these microorganisms, bacteria are frequently used. 
Attempts to isolate pure bacterial cultures capable of degrading azo 
dyes started way back in 1970s with isolation of Bacillus subtilis , 
Aeromonas hydrophila  and Bacillus cereus .10,43 As reflected in Table 
2, there are other extensive reports describing the decolorization of 
reactive azo dyes mediated by pure culture. Among these strains,  
Pseudomonasis  largely exploited to decolorize commercial textile 
azo dyes, such as Remazol Orange 3R by Pseudomonas aeruginosa  
strain BCH with removal of 98 % within 15 minutes44 or Black B.45 
Application of the genus Halomonas46,47 show also promising results Recent advances in textile wastewater treatment using microbial consortia 137

2019;5(3):134 ‒146. DOI: 10.15406/jteft.2019.05.00194azo dye degradation. A.hydrophila and some other aerobic bacteria 
were studied for azo dye decolorization under aerobic condition by 
oxygen insensitive or aerobic azoreductases, because azo reductase 
activity is inhibited in presence of oxygen.48
Fungal pure culture: Phanerochaete chrysosporium  is the most 
frequent, robust and model white-rot fungus reported in the literature 
for decolorizing several dyes from TWWs.49,50 Also, three promising 
strains, Dichomitus squalens , Ischnoderma resinosum  and Pleurotus 
calyptratus  show an efficient decolorization of both Orange G and 
Remazol Brilliant Blue R.51 Another white rot fungus Irpex lacteus  is 
capable to decolorize the chromium metal complex dye Isolan Dark 
Blue 2SGL-01.52 In addition, Trametes pubescens  was found to be the 
most effective strain in terms of decolorization performance on the azo 
dye Congo Red, in submerged culture,53 Trametes maxima CPB3054 
and Fomes fomentarius55 show an ability to remove Remazol Brilliant 
Blue R dye. However, degradation of dyes in TWWs by white-rot 
fungi has some intrinsic drawbacks like the long growth phase and the 
requirement of nitrogen restrictive environments, unreliable enzyme 
production and large reactor size due to the long holding time for 
complete degradation.7,14,56 Multiple fungal species, particulary the 
genus Aspergillus described by57 are able to decolorize a large number 
of dyes. This genus was also reported by.58 Some recent examples are 
detailed in Table 2.
Yeast pure culture: Yeasts present significant advantages such as low 
cost, readily availability of biomass source and resistance to extreme 
environment conditions. Furthermore, several yeasts have been 
found capable to treat TWWs.59The genus Candida is widely used 
in dye decolorization and through biodegradation mechanism60–62 or 
biosorption63,64 or also by bioaugmentation.65 Thermo-tolerant yeast, 
Kluyveromyces marxianus IMB3C has shown the ability to remove 
Remazol Black-B.66
Importance of treatment with microbial consortium reference to 
treatment with mono-culture: Due to the limitations of pure strains 
on decolorization, such as the narrow range for decolorization of 
different azo dyes and the inability to degrade completely or mineralize 
these dyes,67 it has been observed that microbial consortia are mainly 
beneficial as they can conjointly carry out degradation tasks that no single culture can begin effectively.14,68–70 In addition, reports considered 
the consortium as a suitable combination of efficient strains which 
can be used in bioremediation of TWWs providing a rich metabolic 
network.71 In a mixed culture system, the degree of biodegradation 
and mineralization of dyes is higher due to the synergism of metabolic 
activities of a microbial community.7,72,73 In microbial consortium, the 
individual strains may attack the dye molecule at different positions or 
may utilize metabolites produced by the co-existing strains for further 
decomposition.68 In such approaches microbes acclimatize themselves 
to the toxic wastes and new resistant strains develop naturally, which 
then transform various toxic chemicals into less harmful forms.19,74 
The complete degradation of chemical substances is only possible in 
the presence of several enzymes produced by the mixed cultures.14,75 
Aromatic amines generated after cleavage of azo bonds are often 
toxic in nature. But, in a mixed culture, these aromatic amines can be 
degraded by the synergistic action of organisms.76,77 76reported three 
isolates Micrococcus sp., M. luteus , and P . polymyxa , when used in 
mixed culture were able to decolorize nine dyes but individually used, 
they were found to be inefficient for dye removal.14,76
Bacterial consortium: Bacterial consortia are the most frequently 
used for decolorization of azo dyes, as they are generally fast to 
multiply rapidly under aerobic, anaerobic, facultative conditions as 
well as in extreme environmental conditions, like high salinity and 
wide variations in both pH and temperature.14,22 The efficiency of 
bacterial consortium decolorization compared to pure culture removal 
is may be due to the involvement of quorum sensing, mechanism by 
which bacteria regulate gene expression in accordance with population 
density through the use of signal molecules. Quorum sensing allows 
bacteria populations to communicate and coordinate group behavior. 
Recent studies regarding the biodegradation of dyes in TWWs using 
bacterial consortia are reported in Table 2. The bacterial decolorization 
can be directly influenced by various factors78,79 such as the level of 
agitation, oxygen, temperature, pH, dye structure, dye concentration, 
supplementation of different carbon and nitrogen sources, electron 
donor, redox mediator80,81 and salt concentrations. Therefore, 
acclimatized bacteria, isolated from dye contaminated sites, are very 
efficient in removal process due to adaption to different extreme 
environmental conditions.14 Optimization of such abiotic conditions 
makes the microbial system more efficient and practicable (Table 3).

Conversely to decolorization by bacterial consortium, few reports 
are available on decolorization of dyes by yeast consortia and fungal 
consortia, especially on decolorization by biodegradation mechanism 
not by biosorption or bioaugmentation. Another approach is the 
synergistic action of fungal-bacterial consortium which provides an 
alternate way for efficient removal of various contaminants. Some 
reports indicated that fungi-bacteria co-cultures showed higher 
efficiency and stability111–114 to degrade the mixture of many kinds of 
macromolecule organics into small-molecule substances which can 
be further degraded or even mineralized by bacteria.65,115 In addition, 
few studies illustrate the ability of bacterium yeast consortium to 
treat TWWs.116 Apart from these approaches, A synergistic strategy 
occurred by involving plants such a plant-bacterial system using 
Glandularia pulchella   and Pseudomonas monteilii  ANK117 or plant 
consortia.118,119
Mechanism of azo dye degradation 
It is very much important to understand well the mechanism by 
which azo dye decolorization is realized. Generally, biodegradation of 
azo dyes is achieved via two mechanisms either direct decolorization 
or indirect/mediated decolorization. Behind both mechanisms, 
enzymes are well involved to degrade recalcitrant compounds in 
the microbial system.120 Several reports demonstrate the degradation 
of complex organic substances by different enzymes including 
laccase,121,122 azoreductase,123,124 lignin peroxidase,6 NADH-DCIP 
reductase99 and hexane oxidase.25 Among these families of enzymes, 
laccases and azoreductases have shown a great potential to decolorize 
a large range of known industrial dyes. Biodegradation of mainly 
azo dyes is due to the reduction of azo bonds (-N=N-) by azo-
reductase enzymes under anaerobic condition.14 During this process, 
four electrons are transferred from electron donors to the electron 
acceptor (azo dye) in two stages at the azo linkage, resulting in 
dye decolorization and generation of colorless amines.10 Generated 
metabolites or aromatic amines are then further degraded aerobically 
or anaerobically. The role of laccase in asymmetric cleavage of azo 
dye was well reported in biodegradation of anthroquinone and azo 
dyes by a fungal strain Lentinus sp.125 The laccases from Brevibacillus 
sp. (Z1)126 and Anoxybacillus Gonensis P39127 which are applied in 
removal of various azo dyes were purified and characterized. Under 
aerobic conditions, respiration may dominate utilization of NADH 
which inhibits the electron transfer from NADH to azo linkage. 
Thus, decolorization might be related to non-specific extracellular 
reactions occurring between reduced compounds generated by the 
anaerobic biomass.10 In anaerobic conditions, a low redox potential 
(≤50mV) causes the effective decolorization of the azo dyes 
decolorization and azoreductases were found to be oxygen sensitive 
and released extracellularly.128  In order to stimulate the removal 
process of dyes, researchers use redox mediators. Numerous studies 
proved that addition of redox mediators, such as synthetic electron 
carriers, anthraquinone-2-sulfonate or quinone compounds enhance 
significantly biodegradation of azo dyes. However, the high cost of 
quinone addition limited its usage. To make practical the application 
of bacteria-mediated decolorization, other redox mediators like 
activated carbon, carbon black and carbon nano tube were used.Analytical methods for evaluation of dye 
degradation mechanism
Many analytical techniques are applied to identify the intermediates 
and aromatic amines generated during azo dye decolorization. UV-
Vis analysis is a preliminary method by which products produced 
during biodegradation after incubation under anaerobic conditions 
were studied by following the change in the ultraviolet visible (UV-
Vis) spectra. The dye decolorization was estimated by measuring the 
absorbance at λ max of the dye using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer.129 
For further detection of metabolites, Thin Layer Chromatography 
(TLC) and High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) 
techniques are used.130 These methods give insights in numbers 
and types of metabolites generated. But for confirmation of the 
degradation of dye, HPLC has been largely used.10 Moreover, Fourier 
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is also widely applied to 
check the removal of azo group from the azo dye and generation of 
new type of compounds.131 Another powerful techniques used for 
qualitative determination of metabolites are Gas Chromatography-
Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass 
Spectrometry (LC-MS). The evaluation is occurred via molecular 
weights and structural information which is used further to propose 
the degradation pathway of the dye. At present, apart from these 
methods, advance technique, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is 
applied to get detailed quantitative study.132
Microbial toxicity of azo dyes
Microbial degradation of azo dyes generates intermediate organic 
compounds, aromatic amines, which are frequently reported to be 
mutagens and carcinogens. By-products generated may sometimes 
be even more toxic than the dyes themselves.21 Therefore, it is vital 
to evaluate the toxicity of both azo dyes and their metabolites. The 
toxicity caused by dye metabolites may not have the same effect 
on all levels of biological organizations. Basis on this fact, the 
studies on microbe-mediated dye detoxification are categorized into 
molecular, cellular, organismic and ecological levels.133 Molecular 
toxicity includes mutagenicity/genotoxicity which can be caused 
via oxidative DNA damage, micronuclei formation or chromosomal 
aberrations23 To determine this toxicological category, the widely 
used assays are Ames test, Comet assay,109 TUNEL assay and Allium 
cepa . Cellular level is the most investigated in the studies about 
toxic impacts on humans and organismic toxicity is used to identify 
toxicological impacts on model organisms including animals and 
plants. Conversely to these levels, ecotoxical studies are too complex. 
Thus, the main objective of ecotoxicity is to extrapolate and predict 
risk under laboratory conditions. More details about the different tests 
used for evaluation of toxicity azo dyes are mentioned in the Table 
4. All reports98,103,109 using microbial consortium for TWWs treatment 
and degradation of azo dyes prove that it is an efficient approach to 
reduce significantly the toxicity of TWWs and azo dyes.140–150
Conclusion 
TWWs pose a significant threat to the environment due to long 
term disposal. Physico-chemical techniques failed to decolorize 
TWWs in an efficient and economical manner. Bioremediation has 
been emerging approaches to tackle azo dye pollution. The overall Recent advances in textile wastewater treatment using microbial consortia 142

microorganisms as a potential candidate for the removal of dyes from 
TWWs.
In this approach, co-cultivated microorganisms prove a significant 
efficiency in dye decolorization. Microbial consortia was found to be 
advantageous than pure cultures due to concerted metabolic activities 
of microbial community.
Although there are a large number of studies focusing on the field 
of dye decolorization, few studies75 have targeted the real effluent or 
TWWs treatment reference to azo dyes removal. Thus, more attention 
should be paid to commercialize and apply microbial consortia in 
TWWs treatment.
