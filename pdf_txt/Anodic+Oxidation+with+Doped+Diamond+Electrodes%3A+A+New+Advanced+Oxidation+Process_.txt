nonȬsteroidal ȱantiȬinflammatory ȱdrugȱ(NSAID) ȱbelonging ȱtoȱtheȱchemical ȱfamilyȱofȱ
aromatic ȱamides.ȱItȱisȱclassified ȱasȱaȱcommon ȱanalgesic ȱandȱantipyretic ȱdrug,ȱ

analgesic ȱinȱUSA,ȱwithȱproduction ȱofȱ3600ȱtonsȱinȱ2002ȱ[345].ȱParacetamol ȱisȱaȱ
metabolite ȱofȱphenacetine, ȱaȱveryȱcommonly ȱusedȱanalgesic ȱinȱpastȱyears.ȱDueȱtoȱtheȱ

environment ȱcontainsȱcountless ȱorganisms ȱwithȱdifferent ȱsensitivities ȱleadsȱtoȱtheȱ
hypothesis ȱthatȱmedicines ȱmayȱalsoȱposeȱaȱriskȱforȱtheȱenvironment. ȱ
ȱ
Inȱ1994,ȱ153.9Ȭmillionȱparacetamol ȱdosesȱwereȱprescribed. ȱItȱhasȱbeenȱpreviously ȱsaidȱ
thatȱtheȱkeyȱforȱconsidering ȱPPCPsȱasȱaȱmatterȱofȱecological ȱconcernȱisȱtheirȱ
continous ȱintroduction ȱinȱtheȱenvironment ȱdueȱtoȱtheirȱwidespread ȱhugeȱusage.ȱ
Undoubtedly, ȱinȱspiteȱofȱbeingȱconsidered ȱasȱreadilyȱdegradable ȱ(t1/2ȱ<ȱ1ȱday),ȱtheȱ
enormous ȱamountȱofȱparacetamol ȱwhichȱisȱmanufactured ȱandȱreleasedȱtoȱtheȱ
environment ȱcanȱposeȱaȱrisk,ȱyetȱunknown ȱatȱpresent,ȱtoȱbothȱhumansȱandȱanimals.ȱ
Indeed,ȱparacetamol ȱoccupies ȱalmostȱ50%ȱofȱmarketȱsharesȱinȱanalgesic Ȭantipyretic ȱ
fieldȱofȱtheȱworldȱandȱitsȱdemandȱcanȱbeȱupȱtoȱ70000ȱtonsȱannually. ȱAtȱpresent,ȱtheȱ

Acidic aqueous solutions of the drug paracetamol have been degraded by anodic oxidation and indirect electro-oxidation methods
using an undivided electrolytic cell with a Pt anode and an O2-diffusion cathode for H2O2electrogeneration. Anodic oxidation
yields low mineralization due to the limited production of oxidant hydroxyl radical /H20849·OH /H20850from water oxidation at Pt. The presence
of Cu2+as catalyst, with and without /H20849ultraviolet A, UV A /H20850irradiation, slightly enhances the degradation process. In electro-Fenton,
much more·OH is produced from Fenton’s reaction between added Fe2+and electrogenerated H2O2, but stable Fe3+complexes are
formed. These species are partially photodecomposed in photoelectro-Fenton under UV A irradiation. The use of Fe2+and Cu2+
yields fast decontamination because Cu2+complexes are destroyed. Total mineralization of paracetamol is achieved when Fe2+,
Cu2+, and UV A light are combined. The inﬂuence of current, pH, and drug concentration upon the efﬁciency of catalyzed methods
is studied. Hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, and carboxylic acids, such as ketomalonic, maleic, fumaric, oxalic, and oxamic, are
detected as intermediates. The positive synergetic effect of all catalysts is explained by the oxidation of Cu2+-oxalato and
Cu2+-oxamato complexes with·OH, along with the photodecarboxylation of Fe3+-oxalato and Fe3+-oxamato complexes by UV A
light. NH4+and NO3−are released during drug mineralization.

In recent years indirect electro-oxidation methods with
hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration, such as electro-Fenton and
photoelectron-Fenton reactions, are being developed for the treat-
ment of toxic organic pollutants in waters.1-18These environmen-
tally clean electrochemical techniques are carried out in an electro-
lytic cell where H 2O2is continuously generated in the contaminated
solution from the two-electron reduction of O 2at reticulated vitre-
ous carbon,1,3,6,7graphite,2mercury pool,8,13carbon-felt,10,11,16,18
and O 2-diffusion4,5,9,12,14,15,17cathodes
O2+2 H++2 e−→H2O2 /H208511/H20852
Hydrogen peroxide thus produced is a weak oxidant of organics. In
the electro-Fenton reaction, the oxidizing power of this species is
enhanced by addition of small amounts of Fe2+as catalyst to the
acidic treated solution. Hydroxyl radical /H20849·OH /H20850and Fe3+are then
generated from the classical Fenton’s reaction between Fe2+and
H2O2with a second-order rate constant k2of 53 dm3mol−1s−119,20
Fe2++H2O2→Fe3++·O H+O H−/H208512/H20852
An advantage of this method is that Reaction 2 is propagated from
Fe2+regeneration, which mainly occurs by reduction of Fe3+species
at the cathode or in the medium with H 2O2. Hydroxyl radical acts as
a nonselective, strong oxidant because it is able to react with organ-
ics, yielding dehydrogenated or hydroxylated derivatives, until their
overall mineralization /H20849conversion into CO 2and inorganic ions /H20850is
achieved.
The photoelectro-Fenton method also involves the irradiation of
the solution with /H20849ultraviolet A, UV A /H20850light to favor the regeneration
of Fe2+from additional photoreduction of Fe /H20849OH /H208502+, which is the
predominant Fe3+species in acid medium19,20
Fe/H20849OH /H208502++h/H9263→Fe2++·OH /H208513/H20852
Reaction 3 accelerates the production of·OH and, hence, the min-
eralization of organics. In addition, UV A light can photodecompose
complexes of Fe3+with some oxidation products, for example, with
oxalic acid.9,12,14,15,17,21
Some attempts have also been made to show the possible cata-
lytic effect of Cu2+, alone or combined with Fe2+, on the aboveprocedures. Gözmen et al.16have found that bisphenol A in 0.01 M
HCl is more rapidly degraded by the electro-Fenton reaction with
Fe2+than when electrogenerated H 2O2and Cu2+are used. In previ-
ous work17we have described that addition of Cu2+to nitrobenzene
solutions of pH 3.0 accelerates their electro-Fenton and
photoelectro-Fenton processes. A positive synergetic effect of Fe2+
and Cu2+could then be expected for the degradation of other aro-
matic compounds in waters using these indirect electro-oxidation
systems. At the end of such treatments, the resulting acid efﬂuent
should be neutralized up to pH 7–9 for complete decontamination by
precipitation of metallic ions in the form of Fe /H20849OH /H208502,F e /H20849OH /H208503, and
Cu/H20849OH /H208502before disposal. The collected precipitate could even be
reused as a catalyst in further processes.
Recently, there is great interest in the environmental relevance of
pharmaceutical drugs in waters. This pollution can be due to emis-
sion from production sites, direct disposal of overplus drugs inhouseholds, excretion after drug administration to humans and ani-
mals, and treatments throughout the water in ﬁsh farms.22A large
number of pharmaceutical drugs such as antiinﬂammatories, analge-
sics, betablockers, lipid regulators, antibiotics, antiepileptics, and
estrogens have been detected as minor pollutants with concentra-
tions/H1102110/H9262gL−1in sewage treatment plant /H20849STP /H20850efﬂuents, sur-
face and ground waters, and even in drinking water.22-26Paraceta-
mol /H20851N-/H208494-hydroxyphenyl /H20850acetamide /H20852, a common analgesic and
antiinﬂammatory for humans and animals, has been found with con-
centrations up to 6 /H9262gL−1in European STP efﬂuents25and up to
10/H9262gL−1in USA natural waters.26
To avoid the potential dangerous accumulation of drugs in the
aquatic environment, research efforts are underway to develop pow-
erful oxidation techniques for achieving their destruction. Several
works have reported the successful use of ozonation and advanced
oxidation processes /H20849AOPs /H20850such as O 3/H2O2,H 2O2/UV, and
H2O2/Fe2+/UV, with production of·OH as the main oxidant, for the
degradation of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in water.25,27-30
For paracetamol, a poor mineralization of 30 and 40% is found from
O3and H 2O2/UV methods, respectively, in the pH range
2.0–5.5.25In both procedures, hydroquinone, 2-hydroxy-4-
/H20849N-acetyl /H20850aminophenol, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, maleic acid, and
oxalic acid are detected as intermediates. In previous work,31we
have studied the direct anodic oxidation of solutions containing
paracetamol concentrations up to 1 g L−1in the pH range 2.0–12.0
using an electrolytic cell with a Pt or a boron-doped diamond /H20849BDD /H20850*Electrochemical Society Active Member.

ȱȱȱanode and a graphite cathode. Complete mineralization of the drug
with release of NH4+and NO3−ions was always obtained with the
BDD anode due to the great production of oxidant·OH on its sur-
face from water oxidation.32-35Under these conditions, the mineral-
ization rate was pH-independent, the paracetamol decay followed a
complex kinetics, and only oxalic and oxamic acids were identiﬁed
as intermediates in all media. Comparative treatment of the samesolutions with the Pt anode yielded a quite poor mineralization,
because this electrode produces much lower·OH concentration.
However, a slow but complete destruction of paracetamol was
achieved using the Pt anode following its kinetics as a pseudo ﬁrst-
order reaction with a constant rate independent of pH.
To clarify the possible application of indirect electro-oxidation
methods with H 2O2electrogeneration to the removal of aromatic
drugs from waters, we have carried out a study on the mineralization
of paracetamol using Fe2+,C u2+, and/or UV A light as catalysts.
Higher drug concentrations than those found in STP and natural
efﬂuents were chosen to better analyze the oxidation ability of these
methods. In this paper, we report the degradation of 157 mg L−1
paracetamol solutions of pH 3.0 using an undivided cell with a Ptanode and an O
2-diffusion cathode able to generate H 2O2.AP t
electrode, instead of a BDD one, was preferred as anode because its
very low oxidation allows showing an easier and clearer synergeticeffect of catalysts on the degradation process. Comparative elec-trolyses were then performed with this system /H20849anodic oxidation

1m M F e2++ UVA light /H20849photoelectro-Fenton process /H20850,1 m M
Fe2++1m M C u2+, and 1 mM Fe2++1m M C u2++ UVA light.
The inﬂuence of applied current density, solution pH, and drug con-centration upon the behavior of the catalytic methods was also ex-
plored. For each method, the drug decay was followed and its stable
intermediates were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed. A reaction scheme forparacetamol mineralization involving the detected by-products is
proposed.
Experimental
Reagents .— Paracetamol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, aceta-
mide, ketomalonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, oxalic acid, and
oxamic acid were reagent grade from Merck, Sigma-Aldrich, andPanreac. Anhydrous sodium sulfate, heptahydrated ferrous sulfate,
and pentahydrated cupric sulfate were analytical grade from Fluka.
Analytical grade sulfuric acid was purchased from Merck. All solu-tions were prepared with pure water obtained from a Millipore
Milli-Q system with resistivity /H1102218 M/H9024cm at 25°C. Organic sol-
vents and other chemicals employed were either high-pressure liquidchromatography /H20849HPLC /H20850or analytical grade from Panreac.
Apparatus .— Electrolyses were performed with an Amel 2053
potentiostat-galvanostat. The mineralization of paracetamol solu-tions was determined from the abatement of their total organic car-
bon /H20849TOC /H20850, monitored on a Shimadzu VCSN TOC analyzer. Aro-
matic intermediates were separated and identiﬁed by gaschromatography mass spectroscopy /H20849GC-MS /H20850with a Hewlett-
Packard system consisting of a HP 5890 Series II gas chromato-
graph ﬁtted with an HP-5 0.25- /H9262m, 30-m /H110030.25-mm column, and
coupled to an HP 5989A mass spectrometer operating in EI mode at
70 eV and at 300 °C. The paracetamol decay and the evolution of its
aromatic intermediates were followed by reversed-phase chromatog-raphy using a system composed of a Waters 600 HPLC liquid chro-
matograph ﬁtted with a Spherisorb ODS2 5 /H9262m, 150 /H110034.6 mm
column at room temperature, coupled with a Waters 996 photodiode
array detector selected at /H9261= 280 nm and controlled through a
Millennium-32 program. Generated carboxylic acids were detected
by ion-exclusion chromatography using the above HPLC chromato-
graph ﬁtted with an Aminex HPX 87H, 300 /H110037.8 mm column at
35°C from Bio-Rad and the photodiode array detector selected at
/H9261= 210 nm. NH
4+concentration in treated solutions was determined
from the standard colorimetric method with Nessler’s reagent, usinga Unicam UV/vis UV4 spectrophotometer thermostated at 25 °C.
NO3−concentration in the same solutions was obtained by ion chro-
matography with a Shimadzu LC-10AT /H20849VP /H20850liquid chromatograph
coupled with a Metrohm 690 ion chromatograph, ﬁtted with a
Hamilton PRP-X 100 10 /H9262m, 150 /H110034.1 mm anion column at room
temperature and controlled with an HP 35900E interface.
Electrolytic system .— All electrolyses were conducted in an
open, undivided, and thermostated glass-cylindrical cell containing
100 mL of solution stirred with a magnetic bar. A 3-cm2Pt sheet
of 99.99% purity from SEMPSA and a 3-cm2carbon-
poly /H20849tetraﬂuoroethylene /H20850/H20849PTFE /H20850electrode from E-TEK were used
as the anode and cathode, respectively. The last electrode was fed
with pure O 2at 20 mL min−1to generate continuously H 2O2from
Reaction 1. The electrolytic setup and the preparation of the
O2-diffusion cathode have been described.9For the trials with UV A
irradiation, a Philips 6 W ﬂuorescent black light blue tube was
placed at the top of the open cell at 7 cm above the solution. The
tube emitted UV A light in the wavelength region between 300 and
420 nm, with /H9261max= 360 nm, supplying a photoionization energy
input to the solution of 140 /H9262Wc m−2, detected with a NRC 820
laser power meter working at 514 nm.
Comparative degradation of solutions containing 157 mg L−1of
paracetamol and 0.05 M Na 2SO4of pH 3.0 adjusted with H 2SO4
was carried out at a constant current density /H20849j/H20850of 33, 100, and
150 mA cm−2, applying an average cell voltage of 5.5, 13.0, and
17.5 V, respectively. The catalytic effect of Fe2+and/or Cu2+was
studied by adding 1 mM of each ion, because this Fe2+content was
very efﬁcient in the electro-Fenton treatment of other
aromatics.9,12,14,15,17For the electrolyses starting from pH 4.0 and
6.0, the solution pH was regulated within a range of ±0.3 units byadding small volumes of 0.5 M NaOH each 20 min. All trials were
carried out at 35 °C, which is the maximum temperature to work
with the open electrolytic system without signiﬁcant water evapora-tion from solution.
12
Product analysis procedures .— Before analysis, the samples ex-
tracted were ﬁltered with 0.45- /H9262m PTFE ﬁlters from Whatman. Re-
producible TOC values were obtained from analysis of 100- /H9262L ali-
quots using the standard nonpurgeable organic carbon method. In
reversed-phase chromatography, 70:30 /H20849v/v /H20850acetonitrile/water and
95:5 /H20849v/v /H208500.1 M HCOOH + NaOH /H20849pH 3.0 /H20850/acetonitrile mixtures
were employed as mobile phases at 1.2 mL min−1, whereas in ion-
exclusion chromatography, the mobile phase was 4 mM H 2SO4at
0.6 mL min−1.1In both HPLC techniques, 20- /H9262L samples were in-
jected into the chromatograph. NO3−concentration was determined
using a 90:10 /H20849v/v /H208502 mM phthalate buffer /H20849pH 5.0 /H20850/acetone mixture
as mobile phase at 2 mL min−1. To identify the aromatic products,
several paracetamol solutions were electrolyzed during short times
and their organic components were extracted three times with
25 mL of CH 2Cl2. Each collected organic solution was then dried
with anhydrous Na 2SO4, and once ﬁltered, its volume was reduced
to about 5 mL to concentrate the remaining products for further
analysis by GC-MS.
Results and Discussion
Comparative degradation of paracetamol .— The oxidation abil-
ity of the different indirect electro-oxidation treatments was tested
by electrolyzing 157 mg L−1paracetamol solutions /H20849equivalent to
100 mg L−1of TOC /H20850of pH 3.0 at 100 mA cm−2and at 35°C for
6 h. In all experiments the solution pH always remained practically
constant, reaching a ﬁnal value between 2.8 and 3.0. The compara-tive TOC abatement for the above trials is depicted in Fig. 1.
In the electrolytic system, hydrogen peroxide is continuously in-
jected into the solution from Reaction 1, whereas adsorbed·OH is
formed on the Pt surface from water oxidation32-35D2 Journal of The Electrochemical Society ,153 /H208491/H20850D1-D9 /H208492006 /H20850 D2PART B  –Results and Discussion -

In addition, part of the electrogenerated H 2O2is also oxidized to O 2
at the anode via the hydroperoxyl radical /H20849HO2·/H20850, a weaker oxidant
than·OH9,17
H2O2→HO2·+H++e−/H208515/H20852
HO2·→O2+H++e−/H208516/H20852
The use of the electrolytic system without any catalyst corresponds
to the method of anodic oxidation with H 2O2electrogeneration. As
can be seen in curve a of Fig. 1, this treatment leads to a quite slow
TOC decay, only attaining 15% of mineralization at 6 h. This can be
explained by the low concentration of·OH formed on the Pt anode
surface from Reaction 4, which is the main oxidant of paracetamol
and its products. When the solution is exposed to UV A light /H20849see
curve b of Fig. 1 /H20850, the degradation process is slightly enhanced to
give 19% of TOC removal. This behavior suggests a photodecom-
position of several intermediates that accelerates the mineralization
process, because UV A light does not photolyze H 2O2to·OH. Curve
c of Fig. 1 shows that the presence of 1 mM Cu2+causes a faster
degradation rate to reach 28% of decontamination. This enhance-
ment can be accounted for by /H20849i/H20850the oxidation of complexes of Cu2+
with intermediates17and /H20849ii/H20850the production of small amounts of·OH
in the medium from the Cu2+/Cu+catalytic system,36,37involving
the reduction of Cu2+to Cu+with HO2·by Reaction 7 with

Cu++H2O2→Cu2++·O H+O H−/H208519/H20852
The slightly greater degradation observed in curve d of Fig. 1 under
UV A illumination of the 1 mM Cu2+solution also suggests addi-
tional photolysis of some oxidation products.
A much higher TOC removal is achieved when Fe2+is added as
catalyst. For the electro-Fenton process with 1 mM Fe2+/H20849see curve
e of Fig. 1 /H20850, TOC is rapidly reduced by 66% at 6 h, which can berelated to the fast reaction of organics with the great amounts of·OH
produced from Fenton’s Reaction 2. However, the electro-Fentonreaction does not yield total mineralization due to the formation of
products that do not react with·OH, e.g., complexes of short car-
boxylic acids with Fe3+.9,14,15,17Combination of UV A light with
1m MF e2+in the photoelectro-Fenton process /H20849see curve f of Fig.
1/H20850already leads to 87% mineralization. This trend can be related to
/H20849i/H20850the quick photodecomposition of some stable Fe3+complexes
under electro-Fenton conditions and/or /H20849ii/H20850the faster generation of
·OH from additional photoreduction of Fe /H20849OH /H208502+from Reaction 3.
Curve g of Fig. 1, obtained with 1 mM Fe2+and 1 mM Cu2+as
catalysts, shows a similar TOC decay to that of the photoelectro-
Fenton reaction, attaining 90% mineralization. This suggests that
·OH can easily oxidize some complexes of intermediates with Cu2+,
competitively formed with those of Fe3+. As can be seen in curve h
of Fig. 1, all complexes of Cu2+and Fe3+are completely destroyed
when 1 mM Fe2+,1m MC u2+, and UV A light are combined, since
overall mineralization /H20849/H1102298% TOC decay /H20850is reached at the end of
electrolysis.
The above results indicate that the oxidation ability
of the catalyzed methods increases in the order 1 mM Cu2/H11001/H110211m M
Cu2/H11001/H11001UV A light /H112701m MF e2/H11001/H11001UV A light /H333551m MF e2/H11001/H110011m M
Cu2/H11001/H110211m MF e2/H11001/H110011m MC u2/H11001/H11001UV A light. However, only the
last method is potent enough to destroy paracetamol completely.
Evolution of inorganic ions .— The possible loss of the initial ni-
trogen of paracetamol in the form of inorganic ions such as NH4+and
NO3−during its mineralization was investigated. No nitrite ions were
detected in electrolyzed solutions. Figure 2 shows a rapid accumu-
lation of NH4+during the early stages of the above catalyzed treat-
ments and a slow release of this ion from 2 h. The percentage of
initial N converted into NH4+is 48% for 1 mM Cu2+, 51% for 1 mM
Cu2++ UVA light, 53% for 1 mM Fe2+, 66% for 1 mM Fe2+
+ UVA light, 75% for 1 mM Fe2++1m M C u2+, and 93% for
1m MF e2++1m MC u2++ UVA light. In contrast, quite low NO3−
concentrations were found in the same ﬁnal electrolyzed solutions:
for example, 6.35 mg L−1/H2084910% of initial N /H20850for 1 mM Fe2+
+1m MC u2+and a much lower value of 0.7 mg L−1/H208491% of initial
N/H20850for the same catalysts under UV A irradiation. These results indi-
cate that the nitrogen of paracetamol is mainly lost as NH4+, whereas
only a minor portion of it is oxidized to NO3−. More NH4+is formed
with rising oxidation ability of the methods due to the faster miner-alization of some nitrogen-containing intermediates produced at theearly stages of treatments. UV A irradiation also favors the release of
NH
4+, instead of NO3−, probably by photolysis of such by-products.

ȱȱȱMineralization current efﬁciency .— The electrochemical de-
struction of paracetamol involves its transformation into CO 2and
mainly NH4+as inorganic ion. The overall reaction can be written as
follows
HO–C6H4–NH–CO–CH3+ 14H2O→8CO2+N H4++ 33H+
+ 33e−/H2085110/H20852
Reaction 10 presupposes the consumption of 33 F per mole of com-
pound. The mineralization current efﬁciency /H20849MCE /H20850for each experi-
ment was then determined from the following expression
MCE = /H20851/H9004/H20849TOC /H20850exper//H9004/H20849TOC /H20850theor /H20852/H11003100 /H2085111/H20852
where/H9004/H20849TOC /H20850exper is the experimental TOC removal in the solution
at a given time and /H9004/H20849TOC /H20850theoris its theoretical TOC decay assum-
ing that the applied electrical charge /H20849=current /H11003time /H20850is only con-
sumed to mineralize paracetamol by Reaction 10.
Figure 3 shows the evolution of the efﬁciency calculated from
Eq. 11 for the catalyzed experiments depicted in Fig. 1. For 1 mMCu
2+in the absence and presence of UV A light, this parameter is as
low as 1.0–1.4%, slightly increasing at longer electrolysis times. Incontrast, all the other methods involving the Fe3+/Fe2+system are
much more efﬁcient because they have much higher oxidation abil-
ity. The MCE values at 20 min are close to 13% for the
electro-Fenton reaction, 19% for the photoelectron-Fenton reaction,
and 21% for 1 mM Fe2++1m M C u2+with and without UV A
light. At longer times, however, they undergo a dramaticdrop toward the end of electrolysis, increasing
in the order 1 mM Fe
2+/H110211m MF e2++ UVA light
/H333551m MC u2++1m MF e2+/H110211m MC u2++1 mM Fe2++ UVA
light. The gradual decay in efﬁciency with time can be related to the
concomitant fall in pollutant content with formation of more stable
by-products, thus favoring the loss of·OH by parallel nonoxidizing
reactions, e.g., its reaction with Fe2+and/or Cu+and its recombina-
tion into H 2O2.19,36This trend is not so clear for 1 mM Cu2+be-
cause organics are much more slowly degraded.
Effect of experimental parameters .— The inﬂuence of current
on the oxidation ability of each catalyzed method was examined by
electrolyzing 157 mg L−1paracetamol solutions of pH 3.0 at 33,
100, and 150 mA cm−2. Selected results after 1 and 4 h of such
trials are collected in Table I. In all systems the percentage of TOC
removal increases with increasing j. This enhancement in degrada-
tion power can be ascribed to a greater production of·OH at the Pt
anode from Reaction 4 and of H 2O2by the O 2-diffusion cathode
from Reaction 1.9,17The larger accumulation of H 2O2causes the
acceleration of Reactions 2 and/or 9, yielding more·OH concentra-
tion that favors the oxidation of pollutants. Results of Table I indi-
cate that even at 150 mA cm−2the action of Cu2+with and without
UV A light is notably poor, leading to a maximum TOC removal of
21% at 4 h. Under these conditions, the electro-Fenton reaction with
Fe2+is much more effective with 60% TOC decay, because of the
much faster generation of·OH by Reaction 2 than by Reaction 9.
The use of either Fe2++ UVA light or Fe2++C u2+yields a similar
TOC reduction of 80–81% after 4 h at 150 mA cm−2, indicating that
different stable species under electro-Fenton conditions are mineral-
ized in each one of these systems. These products are totally de-
stroyed by the combined action of Fe2+,C u2+, and UV A light, reach-
ing about 95–96% mineralization after 4 h at both 100 and
150 mA cm−2. Table I also shows that at a given time the efﬁciency
of each method always drops with increasing j, i.e., when more·OH
is produced, as stated above. This apparent contradictory behavior

ȱȱȱcan be related to the oxidation of a larger proportion of this radical
to O 2at the anode and the acceleration of its nonoxidizing reactions
in the medium.
The effect of pH was clariﬁed by treating solutions containing
157 mg L−1of drug and initial pH between 2.0 and 6.0 with 1 mM
Fe2++1m MC u2++ UVA light. As an example, Fig. 4 shows the
TOC–time plots obtained at 100 mA cm−2, where the quickest TOC
decay can be observed at pH 3.0. The same trend was found for this
method at 33 and 150 mA cm−2, as well as for similar treatments
using the Fe2+,F e2++ UVA light, and Fe2++C u2+systems. This
behavior can be related to the highest generation rate of their main
oxidant·OH from Reaction 2, because its optimum pH is 2.8,19very
close to pH 3.0 where paracetamol and its oxidation products are
more rapidly destroyed.
The possible inﬂuence of Fe2+and Cu2+concentrations was
tested by electrolyzing 157 mg L−1drug solutions of pH 3.0 con-
taining between 0.25 and 1 mM of both ions at 100 mA cm−2under
UV A illumination. As can be seen in Fig. 5, all solutions are miner-
alized with similar rate up to 95–98% of TOC reduction at 6 h,
indicating that such ions act in catalytic amounts to destroy parac-etamol.
The oxidation ability of the system with 1 mM Fe
2++1m M
Cu2++ UVA light to degrade drug concentrations /H110211gL−1of pH
3.0 at 100 mA cm−2was also examined. Figure 6a shows that total
mineralization is attained for up to 313 mg L−1of paracetamol,whereas 6 and 10% TOC remain in solution from 625 and
940 mg L−1, respectively, after prolonged electrolysis. The method
is then able to destroy up to ca. 0.4 g L−1of drug under the present
experimental conditions. Figure 6b presents the MCE–time plots for
the experiments of Fig. 6a. As can be seen, the efﬁciency increases
with rising drug concentration, indicating a faster removal of larger
amounts of organics. Because the same production of·OH is ex-
pected from Reactions 2, 3, 4, and 9 in all trials, it seems plausibleto consider that its competitive nonoxidizing reactions become
slower and more·OH concentration can then react with pollutants.
From 313 mg L−1of paracetamol, MCE progressively rises during
longer times at early stages of the treatment, reaching a maximum
value of 36% for 940 mg L−1at 2 h. This suggests an increasing
formation of products that react more easily with·OH than the drug
at early stages of electrolysis.
From the above ﬁndings, one can conclude that indirect electro-
oxidation methods with H 2O2electrogeneration using at least Fe2+
as catalyst are more effective for paracetamol degradation from wa-
ter than classical ozonation and H 2O2/UV.25For these electrochemi-
cal techniques, the optimum operative pH is 3.0. When Fe2+,C u2+,
and UV A light are combined, small quantities /H20849up to 1 mM /H20850of both
ions are needed for achieving total mineralization of solutions con-
taining up to about 0.4 g L−1of drug at low current.
Identiﬁcation of intermediates .— An attempt was made to iden-
tify the stable aromatic intermediates formed during paracetamol
mineralization by means of GC-MS. To do this, solutions with 157
and 313 mg L−1of this compound at pH 3.0 were electrolyzed at
100 mA cm−2and at 35°C by anodic oxidation for 20 min
and using 1 mM Fe2++1m MC u2++ UVA light for 5 min. All MS

identiﬁed from comparison of their trvalues and uv-visible /H20849UV-vis /H20850
spectra, measured on the photodiode array detector, with those of
pure compounds. The ion-exclusion chromatograms of treated solu-
tions displayed peaks associated with generated carboxylic acids
such as oxalic /H20849tr= 6.7 min /H20850, ketomalonic /H20849tr= 6.8 min /H20850, maleic
/H20849tr= 8.1 min /H20850, oxamic /H20849tr= 9.4 min /H20850, and fumaric /H20849tr= 15.8 min /H20850
acids.
Ketomalonic, maleic, and fumaric acids come from the oxidation
of the aryl moiety of paracetamol, as reported for otheraromatics.5,7,12,14,17,33-35The treatment of solutions containing
50 mg L−1of each one of these acids of pH 3.0 with 1 mM Fe2+
+1m MC u2++ UVA light showed that they are only oxidized to
oxalic acid. Oxamic acid could be produced from·OH attack on
acetamide, released when paracetamol gives hydroquinone. This
was conﬁrmed by treating 50 mg L−1of acetamide with the above
system at pH 3 and at 100 mA cm−2, because only oxamic acid was
detected as product. Electrolyses of solutions with 50 mg L−1of
oxalic or oxamic acid of pH 3.0 at 100 mA cm−2revealed that both
acids remain stable in the presence of 1 mM Fe2+, whereas they are
slowly degraded using 1 mM Cu2+. When such solutions were ex-
posed to UV A light without applying current, it was found that both
acids are not photolyzed with 1 mM Cu2+, but the presence of
1m MF e2+causes a quick and overall transformation of oxalic acid
into CO 2and a very slow mineralization of oxamic acid. It was also
conﬁrmed that only NH4+is released when oxamic acid is mineral-
ized.
Paracetamol decay and evolution of intermediates .— Once the
identity of chromatographic peaks was made, a 157 mg L−1parac-
etamol solution of pH 3.0 at 35°C was degraded by all treatments at100 mA cm
−2, and the concentration of the drug and its products
was determined as a function of electrolysis time via external cali-
bration by using standard compounds.
Figure 7 shows that paracetamol undergoes a slow and similar
decay for anodic oxidation and in the presence of Cu2+, both with
and without UV A irradiation, disappearing from the medium in
75 min. These ﬁndings indicate that the main oxidant in these meth-
ods is·OH formed in small amount on the anode from Reaction 4. In
contrast, the drug is rapidly removed in 6 min with a similar rate for
the four treatments involving Fe2+, alone or combined with Cu2+
and/or UV A light, thus conﬁrming that it is mainly destroyed by the
large amounts of·OH generated from Fenton’s Reaction 2, with
little contribution of Reaction 4. Note that the decay of paracetamol
does not follow kinetic equations related to simple reaction orders.
This suggests the existence of a complex·OH attack on this com-
pound, leading to different primary products such as hydroquinone
and 2-hydroxy-4- /H20849N-acetyl /H20850aminophenol, identiﬁed during its treat-
ment with O 3and H 2O2/UV.25Under our experimental conditions,
however, the second species is undetected, probably because it is
rapidly destroyed by·OH.
The evolution of hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone for the cata-
lyzed methods is shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. In all casesthese products are present in the medium while the initial drug per-
sists in it. A small concentration of about 0.6 mg L
−1is achieved asmaximum for hydroquinone using 1 mM Cu2+in the presence and
absence of UV A irradiation, as expected if it is rapidly oxidized to
p-benzoquinone. In both procedures the latter species is more slowly
degraded and can reach maximum concentrations of 19–23 mg L−1
at 20 min. However, both products are quickly formed and de-stroyed at a similar rate in the methods catalyzed at least with Fe
2+,
attaining their maximum concentrations at 2–3 min. These results
corroborate that these aromatic products are mainly oxidized by
·OH, not being photodegraded by UV A light.
A very different behavior was found for generated carboxylic
acids. As can be seen in Fig. 8c, ketomalonic acid is not completely
removed after 6 h of electrolysis using both Cu2+systems, but it is
quickly oxidized to oxalic acid in 40 min by the other methods with
Fe2+. Figure 8d shows that maleic acid, similarly to its trans -isomer
fumaric acid, is completely converted into oxalic acid in all cases.
The slow accumulation of ketomalonic and maleic acids in the pres-
ence of Cu2+can then be related to the slow oxidation of aromatic
intermediates, whereas their fast degradation by the other methods
with Fe2+indicates that they are mainly oxidized by the action of
·OH formed from Fenton’s Reaction 2. In contrast, Fig. 8e and f
shows that the evolution of oxalic and oxamic acids depends on the
catalyst used. For both Cu2+systems, small concentrations between
2 and 4 mg L−1of both acids remain in solution. When only Fe2+is
used, 90 mg L−1of oxalic acid and 31 mg L−1of oxamic acid are
accumulated without practical destruction. The use of Fe2++ UVA
light causes a fast removal of oxalic acid up to a ﬁnal value of
8m gL−1, while 42 mg L−1of oxamic acid is reached at 2 h, further
being slowly reduced to 29 mg L−1. By combining Fe2+and Cu2+,
27 mg L−1of oxalic acid and 2 mg L−1of oxamic acid persist at
6 h. For the Fe2++C u2++ UVA light system, both acids are totally
mineralized, in agreement with the total decontamination found forthe paracetamol solution /H20849see curve h of Fig. 1 /H20850.
The degradation behavior of oxalic and oxamic acids can be
related to the destruction of their complexes with Fe
3+and Cu2+.17,21
When paracetamol is treated with only Fe2+,F e3+-oxalate and
Fe3+-oxamato complexes are competitively formed by the efﬁcient
generation of Fe3+from Fenton’s Reaction 2, but they cannot be
mineralized by·OH limiting the oxidation ability of the electro-
Fenton reaction. The ﬁnal solution of this treatment is composed of
a mixture of stable Fe3+complexes of both acids, because their
concentrations in Fig. 8e and f are equivalent to 33 mg L−1TOC,
the same value attained by the paracetamol solution at 6 h /H20849see
curve e of Fig. 1 /H20850. The remaining steady oxamic acid contains 33%
initial nitrogen, indicating that NH4+present in such a solution /H20849see
Fig. 2 /H20850is produced by the degradation of products different from
acetamide. The efﬁcient photodecomposition of Fe3+-oxalato com-

photoelectro-Fenton reaction /H20849see curve f of Fig. 1 /H20850. When only the
Cu2+system is used, Cu2+-oxalato and Cu2+-oxamato complexes are
formed to a small extent in the medium, being destroyed by·OH but
not photolyzed by UV A light. The mineralization of these complexescan also explain the highest decontamination of paracetamol found
in the presence of 1 mM Cu
2+than by anodic oxidation /H20849see Fig. 1 /H20850.
By combining Fe2+and Cu2+as catalysts, Fe3+-oxalato,
Fe3+-oxamato, Cu2+-oxalato, and Cu2+-oxamato complexes are pro-
duced, but only the Cu2+complexes are destroyed, leading to a rapid
TOC decay of paracetamol /H20849see curve g of Fig. 1 /H20850. The quickest and
total mineralization of the drug with Fe2++C u2++ UVA light can
thus be related to the oxidation of Cu2+-oxalato and Cu2+-oxamato
complexes with·OH in parallel with the photodecomposition of
their Fe3+complexes by UV A light.Proposed degradation pathway .— A general reaction scheme
for the mineralization of paracetamol in acid media by all indirect
electro-oxidation methods with H 2O2electrogeneration under the
action of Fe2+,C u2+, and/or UV A light as catalysts is proposed in
Fig. 9. The pathway involves all intermediates detected in this work
and only shows the main oxidant·OH for sake of simplicity, al-
though parallel reactions with other weaker oxidizing agents /H20849H2O2,
HO2·,C u2+,F e3+, etc. /H20850are also possible. The process is initiated by
·OH attack at the C /H208494/H20850-position of paracetamol, breaking its N-bond
to yield hydroquinone and acetamide. Further oxidation of hydro-
quinone gives p-benzoquinone, which is degraded to a mixture of
ketomalonic, maleic, and fumaric acids. These acids are subse-
quently transformed into oxalic acid. Parallel oxidation of acetamide
leads to oxamic acid. Oxalic and oxamic acids are slowly converted

ȱinto CO 2by·OH, although they form complexes with Fe3+and/or
Cu2+when one or both ions are present in the medium. Although
Cu2+-oxalato and Cu2+-oxamato complexes are mineralized with
·OH, Fe3+-oxalato and Fe3+-oxamato complexes are very stable un-
der electro-Fenton conditions. Both Fe3+complexes can be photo-
decarboxylated with loss of Fe2+under the action of UV A light, as
proposed by Zuo and Hoigné.21The mineralization of oxamic acid is
accompanied by the loss of NH4+. This inorganic ion, along with
small amounts of NO3−, is also released during the degradation of
undetected products, probably coming from unstable 2-hydroxy-4-
/H20849N-acetyl /H20850aminophenol formed from direct hydroxylation at the
C/H208492/H20850-position of paracetamol.25
Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that acidic aqueous solutions of parac-
etamol can be rapidly degraded using an undivided electrolytic cell
with a Pt anode and an O 2-diffusion cathode able to electrogenerate
H2O2under the combined catalytic action of 1 mM Fe2+,1 m M
Cu2+, and UV A light. This indirect electro-oxidation method allows
complete mineralization for drug concentrations /H110210.4 g L−1, be-
cause of the high amounts of·OH produced from Fenton’s reaction
that oxidize the complexes of oxalic and oxamic acids with Cu2+,
along with the parallel photolysis of their complexes with Fe3+. This
treatment is more efﬁcient than one involving 1 mM Fe2+and 1 mM
Cu2+, or a photoelectro-Fenton system with 1 mM Fe2+and UV A
light, where the complexes of oxalic and oxamic acids with Fe3+
and/or Cu2+are more slowly destroyed. For an electro-Fenton sys-
tem with 1 mM Fe2+, a lower decontamination is reached because
Fe3+-oxalato and Fe3+-oxamato complexes are not destroyed by
·OH. The optimum pH for all these electro-oxidation methods is 3.0.
In contrast, the presence of 1 mM Cu2+as catalyst or the use of
direct anodic oxidation, both with and without UV A light, leads to
slow destruction of pollutants due to the formation of small amounts
of·OH from water oxidation at the Pt anode, which are not signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced by reaction of Cu+with H 2O2. The percentage of
TOC removal in all treatments increases with increasing applied
current due to the greater production of·OH. The original nitrogen
of the drug is mainly lost as NH4+ion, along with a very small
proportion of NO3−ion. In all cases, hydroquinone and
p-benzoquinone are identiﬁed as aromatic products. The formation
of hydroquinone is accompanied by the release of acetamide, whichis further oxidized to oxamic acid. Degradation of p-benzoquinone
leads to a mixture of ketomalonic, maleic, and fumaric acids, which
are subsequently converted into oxalic acid.

Abstract
The degradation of 100ml of solutions with paracetamol ( N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide) up to 1gl/C01in the pH
range 2.0–12.0 has been studied by anodic oxidation in a cell with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a graphite
cathode, both of 3-cm2area, by applying a current of 100, 300 and 450mA between 25 and 45 /C176C. Complete mineral-
ization is always achieved due to the great concentration of hydroxyl radical (/C5OH) generated at the BDD surface, with
release of NHþ
4and NO/C0
3ions. The mineralization rate is pH-independent, increases with increasing applied current and
temperature, but decreases when drug concentration raises from 315mgl/C01. Reversed-phase chromatography revealed a
similar complex paracetamol decay in acid and alkaline media. Ion-exclusion chromatography allowed the detection of
oxalic and oxamic acids as ultimate carboxylic acids. When the same solutions have been comparatively treated with a
Pt anode, a quite poor mineralization is found because of the production of much lower/C5OH concentration. Under
these conditions, the degradation rate is enhanced in alkaline medium and polymerization of intermediates is favored
in concentrated solutions. Paracetamol can be completely destroyed with Pt and its kinetics follows a pseudo-ﬁrst-order
reaction with a constant rate independent of pH.

1. Introduction
There is growing interest in the environmental rele-
vance of pharmaceutical drugs in waters. This pollution
can be due to emission from production sites, direct dis-
posal of overplus drugs in households, excretion afterdrug administration to humans and animals and treat-
ments throughout the water in ﬁsh farms ( Zwiener and
Frimmel, 2000 ). Since thousands of tons per year of
drugs are consumed worldwide, a high number of anti-
inﬂammatory, analgesics, betablockers, lipid regulators,
antibiotics, antiepileptics and estrogens has been found
as minor pollutants, usually with concentrations
<10lgl/C01, in sewage treatment plant (STP) eﬄuents,
surface and ground waters and even in drinking waters
(Daughton and Jones-Lepp, 2001; Ku ¨mmerer, 2001;
Ternes et al., 2002 ). For paracetamol ( N-(4-hydroxyphe-
nyl)acetamide), concentrations up to 6 lgl/C01have been

ȱdetected in STP eﬄuents. Although there has been no
proof that very low amounts of pharmaceuticals in nat-
ural waters have any adverse health eﬀects, they can pro-
duce toxic eﬀects to aquatic organisms and in the case of
antimicrobials, the development of multi-resistant
strains of bacteria ( Balciog ˇlu and O ¨tker, 2003 ). To avoid
the dangerous accumulation of drugs in the aquaticenvironment, research eﬀorts are underway to develop
more powerful oxidation methods than those currently
applied in wastewater treatments for achieving their
complete destruction.
Ozonation and some advanced oxidation processes
(AOPs), such as O
3/H2O2,H 2O2/UV and H 2O2/Fe2+/
UV, have been successfully used to remove several com-
mon pharmaceuticals in aqueous media ( Zwiener and
Frimmel, 2000; Ravina et al., 2002; Ternes et al., 2002,
2003; Vogna et al., 2002; Andreozzi et al., 2003;Balciog ˇlu and O ¨tker, 2003; Huber et al., 2003 ). The great
eﬀectiveness of AOPs is due to the production of hyd-
roxyl radical (
/C5OH), which is a non-selective, very pow-
erful oxidizing agent able to react with organics giving
dehydrogenated or hydroxylated derivatives, up to their
complete mineralization is reached (conversion into
CO 2, water and inorganic ions). For paracetamol, how-
ever, only partial mineralization of 30% and 40% has
been found from ozonation and H 2O2/UV, respectively,
in the pH range 2.0–5.5 ( Andreozzi et al., 2003 ), indicat-
ing that more potent methods have to be applied to be
completely mineralized.
In the last years, eﬀective electrochemical treatments
for the destruction of biorefractory organics in watersare being developed. The most usual technique is anodic
oxidation, where solutions are decontaminated during
electrolysis by the direct reaction of pollutants with ad-
sorbed
/C5OH formed at the anode surface from oxidation
either of water in acid and neutral media or hydroxide
ion at pH P10 (Brillas et al., 2003; Marselli et al.,
2003; Torres et al., 2003 ):
H2O!/C5OH adsþHþþe/C0ð1Þ
OH/C0!/C5OH adsþe/C0ð2Þ
However, most aromatics in acid and alkaline media
treated by anodic oxidation with conventional anodes
such as Pt, PbO 2, doped PbO 2, doped SnO 2and IrO 2,
are slowly depolluted due to the generation of diﬃcultyoxidizable carboxylic acids ( Brillas et al., 1998, 2003;
Bonfatti et al., 1999; Rodgers et al., 1999; Torres
et al., 2003 ). The recent use of a boron-doped diamond
(BDD) thin ﬁlm anode has shown that it has much
larger O
2overvoltage than the above anodes, giving a
much higher concentration of adsorbed/C5OH and a
quicker oxidation of pollutants. Anodic oxidation with
BDD then seems a suitable method for degrading orga-
nics up to their total mineralization, as found for HClO 4
aqueous solutions containing carboxylic acids such asacetic, malic, formic and oxalic ( Gandini et al., 2000 ),
4-chlorophenol ( Rodrigo et al., 2001 ), phenol ( Iniesta
et al., 2001 ) and herbicide 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid
(Boye et al., 2002 ), as well as for malic acid at pH 2.7
and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at pH 9.2 ( Kraft
et al., 2003 ) and for amarantha dyestuﬀ in Na 2SO4solu-
tions ( Hattori et al., 2003 ).
This paper reports a study on the anodic oxidation
with BDD of solutions containing paracetamol concen-
trations lower than 1gl/C01and a low salt content of
0.05M Na 2SO4to operate under similar conditions to
those of aquatic environment. Higher drug concentra-
tions than those found in STP and natural eﬄuents were
chosen to analyze better the oxidation ability of this
method. The eﬀect of pH in the range 2.0–12.0, applied
current and temperature on the mineralization rate of
this compound was examined. Comparative treatments
using Pt as anode were made to conﬁrm the high oxidiz-ing power of BDD. The drug decay and the evolution of
generated carboxylic acids were determined by chroma-
tographic techniques.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Paracetamol, oxalic acid and oxamic acids were
reagent grade from Merck and Avocado. Anhydrous
sodium sulfate used as background electrolyte was ana-lytical grade from Fluka. All solutions were prepared
with water from a Millipore Milli-Q system (conductiv-
ity <6 ·10
/C08Scm/C01). The solution pH was adjusted
with sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide, both of analy-
tical grade, from Merck. Organic solvents and the other
chemicals used were either HPLC or analytical grade
from Panreac and Aldrich.
2.2. Apparatus and analysis procedures
All electrolyses were performed with an Amel 2053
potentiostat-galvanostat. The solution pH was meas-
ured with a Crison 2000 pH-meter. Samples extracted
from electrolyzed solutions were ﬁltered with 0.45 lm
PTFE ﬁlters from Whatman before analysis. The degra-
dation of paracetamol solutions was monitored by the
removal of their Total Organic Carbon (TOC), deter-
mined on a Shimadzu VCSN TOC analyzer. Reproduc-
ible TOC values were always obtained using the
standard non-purgeable organic carbon method. The
paracetamol decay was followed by reversed-phase
chromatography with a Waters system composed of a
Waters 600 HPLC liquid chromatograph ﬁtted with a
Spherisorb ODS2 5 lm, 150 ·4.6mm, column at room
temperature, and coupled with a Waters 996 photodiode
array detector selected at 246nm, controlled through a400 E. Brillas et al. / Chemosphere 58 (2005) 399–406PART B  –Results and Discussion -

injecting 20- ll aliquots into the chromatograph and cir-
culating a 70:30 (v/v) acetonitrile/water mixture at
1.2mlmin/C01as mobile phase. Generated carboxylic
acids were followed by ion-exclusion chromatography
by injecting 20- ll samples into the above HPLC system
with an Aminex HPX 87H, 300 ·7.8mm column, at
35/C176C from Bio-Rad. For these measurements, the pho-
todiode detector was selected at 210nm and the mobile

tometric detector. These analyses were carried out with
100-ll aliquots after being ultramicroﬁltrated by Ultra-
free ﬁlters 10000 dalton cutoﬀ and a borate-gluconate
buﬀer of pH 8.5 as mobile phase.
2.3. Electrolytic system
All electrolyses were conducted in an open, one-com-
partment and thermostated cylindrical cell containing a
100-ml solution stirred with a magnetic bar. The anode
was a 3-cm
2BDD thin ﬁlm deposited on a conductive
Si sheet purchased from CSEM. For comparative pur-
poses, a 3-cm2Pt sheet of 99.99% purity from SEMP
was also employed as anode. The cathode was always
a 3-cm2graphite bar from Sofacel. The interelectrode
gap was about 3cm.
Solutions containing less than 1gl/C01of paracetamol
and 0.05M Na 2SO4of initial pH between 2.0 and 12.0
were comparatively degraded using a Pt or a BDD
anode at constant current ( I) of 100, 300 and 450mA
and at 35 /C176C. The eﬀect of temperature ( T) in the range
25–45 /C176C was also studied. During electrolyses for initial
pH values P4.0, the solution pH was continuously reg-
ulated within a range of ±0.03 units by adding small vol-
umes of 0.5M NaOH each 20min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Comparative degradation behavior
A solution of 157mgl/C01of paracetamol (correspond-
ing to 100mgl/C01of TOC) of pH 3.0 was initially electro-
lyzed at 300mA and at 35 /C176C for 6h to test its
comparative degradation using a Pt or a BDD anode.
In both cases, the solution pH remained practically con-
stant up to ﬁnal values of 2.8 or 3.3, respectively. Note
that this parameter does not change when the sameamounts of H
+in the anode and OH/C0in the cathode
from water oxidation and reduction, respectively, areproduced. The small pH decay for the Pt anode can then
be related to the parallel oxidation of organic pollutants
on its surface that releases an excess of H+from their
hydrogen atoms (see, for example, Eq. (3)), thus slightly
raising the medium acidity. The opposite trend found
for the BDD anode can be due to the existence of a small
proportion of oxidations of other species present in itssurface without H
+liberation, giving rise to the accumu-
lation of an excess of OH/C0in the medium that slightly
increases its pH. The starting colorless solution always
became clear yellow from 10–20min of treatment dueto the formation of some soluble aromatic products,
although for the BDD anode, it was turned colorless
again after 90min because of the overall destruction ofsuch species by
/C5OH adsorbed on its surface. The change
in solution TOC with applied speciﬁc charge Q(in
Ahl/C01) for such trials is depicted in Fig. 1 . A quite slow
mineralization can be observed for Pt, only attaining
19% of TOC removal at 6h ( Q=1 8Ahl/C01). In contrast,
TOC very rapidly falls using BDD, so that paracetamol
is completely mineralized (>98% of TOC decay) at the
same time. These results indicate that anodic oxidation
with BDD is a useful method for the fast and total
destruction of paracetamol and its oxidation products,
whereas the Pt anode has much smaller oxidizing power
(with lower production of adsorbed/C5OH) and leads to
poor mineralization.
To clarify if the above behavior can be generalized to
diﬀerent aqueous media, comparative electrolyses at
300mA were also carried out with 157mgl/C01of para-
cetamol at pH 2.0 and in the pH range 4.0–12.0. Whilethe solution pH did not vary along the experiments
starting from pH 2.0, gradual pH decay with time
was found at pH P4.0, this being the reason why the
solution pH was continuously regulated to its initial

ȱvalue. Under the latter conditions, the anode feature af-
fected the color of treated solutions. For Pt, dark-orange
solutions were always obtained at 1–2h, becoming yel-
low at 6h. This suggests the generation of soluble poly-
aromatic compounds on Pt, which are further slowly
oxidized. A very diﬀerent behavior was observed for
anodic oxidation with BDD where clear yellow solutions
were obtained for 2h as maximum, being colorless at
longer times, as expected if small amounts of soluble
aromatic products are formed and quickly destroyed
on this anode in all media. Fig. 1 also shows the TOC-
Qplots obtained for these experiments. A very poor
depollution can be seen for all pH values when Pt is
used, since at 18Ahl/C01TOC is only reduced by 17%
at pH 2.0 and 4.0, 27% at pH 8.0 and about 35% at
pH 10.0 and 12.0. From these data, one can conclude
the existence of a larger mineralization of paracetamol
in alkaline than in acid solutions. This tendency can beaccounted for: (i) the generation of a greater concentra-
tion of oxidizing
/C5OH at the Pt surface by reaction (2)
than by reaction (1); and/or (ii) the faster destruction
of more easily oxidizable compounds present in alkaline
medium, such as the anionic forms of possible phenolic
derivatives ( Torres et al., 2003 ). In contrast, a similar
TOC decay can be observed in Fig. 1 in all media under
treatment by anodic oxidation with BDD, reaching
overall mineralization at Qvalues between 15 and
18Ahl/C01. This brings to consider that the concentration
of generated/C5OH at the BDD surface is always so high
that all oxidation products have similar degradation rate
within the pH range 2.0–12.0.
The above results conﬁrm the great oxidizing power
of BDD for an eﬃcient and complete mineralization of
paracetamol. The possible eﬀect of other experimental
parameters on TOC decay, as drug concentration, ap-
plied current and temperature, was then studied to know
the best operative conditions for this method.
3.2. Eﬀect of experimental parameters on paracetamol
mineralization
A series of experiments was performed by electrolyz-
ing solutions of paracetamol with concentration lower
than 1gl/C01of pH 3.0 at 300mA and at 35 /C176C up to total
mineralization by anodic oxidation with BDD. In all
cases, the solution pH practically did not change with
electrolysis time and a clear yellow color solution was
observed for 90–120min as maximum, as expected if sol-
uble aromatic products are formed in low extent and
rapidly oxidized. As can be seen in Fig. 2 a, all solutions
are completely mineralized, being required the consump-
tion of a speciﬁc charge of about 36Ahl/C01(12h),
30Ahl/C01(10h), 24Ahl/C01(8h), 15Ahl/C01(5h) and
12Ahl/C01(4h) for 948, 677, 315, 157 and 78mgl/C01of
initial compound. The increase in Qwith increasing
drug concentration can be simply related to the existenceof more pollutants. This behavior can be better analyzed
from the percentages of TOC removal after 1 and 4h of
treatment collected in Table 1 . These data reveal a sim-
ilar TOC decay of 27–30% at 1h and 86–91% at 4h up to
315mgl/C01, whereas at higher concentration, the percent-
age of TOC removal undergoes a gradual fall attaining
values of 15% at 1h and 70% at 4h for 948mgl/C01. All
these results allow establishing that the quickest mineral-
ization rate for paracetamol by anodic oxidation with
BDD is achieved working up to 315mgl/C01, although
the method is eﬀective enough to depollute more concen-
trated solutions. Note that when the same experiments
were comparatively made with Pt, a dark-orange precip-
itate was formed from 315mgl/C01of paracetamol after
6h, indicating the generation of insoluble polyaromatic
compounds by slow reactions between products present
in great concentration in solution. Anodic oxidation
with Pt then favors polymerization of intermediates in
concentrated solutions, thus limiting their mineraliza-
tion process.
A more signiﬁcant eﬀect was found by varying the
applied current. Fig. 2 a shows that Qvalues of 9Ahl/C01
(9h), 15Ahl/C01(5h) and 18Ahl/C01(4h) are needed to
depollute a 157mgl/C01paracetamol solution of pH 3.0

ȱȱȱat 100, 300 and 450mA, respectively, and at 35 /C176C. Since
the speciﬁc charge increases as current rises, less electro-lysis time is needed for total mineralization. This presup-
poses an increase in removed TOC with increasing Iat
constant time, as can be easily deduced from results
given in Table 1 , where at 1h of treatment, for example,
the percentage of TOC removal gradually raises from
20% to 36% between 100 and 450mA. The fact that
increasing current causes faster depollution can be re-
lated to the concomitant generation of more
/C5OH on
the BDD surface. On the other hand, a similar behavior
was found by varying the temperature from 25 to 45 /C176C.
Note that higher temperatures cannot be used in our sys-
tem due to fast evaporation of water. Results of Table 1
show that at 100mA, the TOC of the above solution is
reduced by 13%, 20% and 26% for 1h and by 41%,64% and 74% for 4h at 25, 35 and 45 /C176C, respectively.
The reaction of pollutants with
/C5OH is then accelerated
with raising temperature, enhancing drug mineraliza-tion. Since the increase in temperature causes a greater
mass transfer to the anode due to the decrease of
medium viscosity, it can be inferred that the oxidation
process under such experimental conditions is limited,
at least partially, by the mass transfer of organics to
the BDD surface.
The inorganic ions released after total mineralization
of a 157mgl
/C01paracetamol solution of pH 3.0 by anodic
oxidation with BDD at 300mA and at 35 /C176C were deter-
mined. Concentrations for NHþ
4and NO/C0
3of 12.2 and
22.0mgl/C01, respectively, corresponding to 65% and
35% of initial nitrogen content, were found. No nitrite
ions were detected by ion chromatography. To ascertainthe nature of NO
/C0
3generation, a 100-ml solution with
100mgl/C01of ammonium ion (as (NH 4)2SO4) of pH 3.0
was electrolyzed under similar conditions for 6h and
20mgl/C01of NO/C0
3, due to the oxidation of 5.8% of initial
NHþ
4, were determined in the ﬁnal solution. These re-
sults indicate the main release of NHþ
4during the/C5OHattack on N-derivatives of paracetamol, with a small
proportion of it transformed into NO/C0
3at the BDD
anode. However, the major part of NO/C0
3accumulated
in the mineralization process comes from the degrada-
tion of N-intermediates.
3.3. Current eﬃciency for the mineralization process
The above considerations allow concluding that min-
eralization of paracetamol involves its conversion into
carbon dioxide and mainly NHþ
4. The overall reaction
can be written as follows:
HO–C6H4–NH–CO–CH 3þ14H 2O
!8CO 2þNHþ
4þ33Hþþ34e/C0ð3Þ
The current eﬃciency (CE) at a given time tfor the
above solutions was then comparatively estimated from
the following equation:
current efficiency ¼½DðTOCÞexper=DðTOCÞtheor/C138/C2100
ð4Þ
where D(TOC) experis the experimental solution TOC re-
moval at time tandD(TOC) theoris the theoretically cal-
culated TOC removal assuming that the applied
electrical charge (=current ·time) is only consumed to
yield Eq. (3)as mineralization process.
Fig. 2 b shows the eﬃciencies determined from Eq. (4)
for the trials depicted in Fig. 2 a. Several selected CE val-
ues are also collected in Table 1 . As can be seen in Fig.
2b, in most cases the eﬃciency increases at the ﬁrst treat-
ment stages, up to 2h for 677 and 948mgl/C01of paraceta-
mol, suggesting the initial generation of more easily
oxidizable products than the initial compound. Results
ofFig. 2 b and Table 1 show a continuous drop in CE
with time once passed its maximum value, indicating a
concomitant fall in oxidizing ability of the electrolytic
system. This behavior can be ascribed to the gradualTable 1

ȱdecay in pollutant concentration favoring that/C5OH can
be wasted by other parallel non-oxidizing reactions,
e.g. its recombination into H 2O2; that is, the remaining
products are more slowly degraded with decreasing
/C5OH concentration at the BDD surface. The drop in eﬃ-
ciency with decreasing drug concentration also supports
this interpretation (see Fig. 2 b and Table 1 ). For exam-
ple, CE values of 33%, 24%, 14%, 7.2% and 3.4% for948, 677, 315, 157 and 78mgl
/C01of this compound are
found after 4h of treatment at 300mA and at 35 /C176C. This
trend can be related again with a slower degradation oforganics by an enhancement of parallel non-oxidizing
reactions of generated
/C5OH. The same explanation can
justify the decreasing eﬃciencies found with increasing
Ifor 157mgl/C01of paracetamol at 35 /C176C (see Fig. 2 b
andTable 1 ). Although the increase in current yields
more TOC removal of this solution because of the gen-
eration of more/C5OH at the BDD, a larger proportion of
this radical is gradually wasted, making less eﬃcient its
reaction with organics. Results of Table 1 also conﬁrm
that the process becomes much more eﬃcient as temper-
ature raises, as expected if reactions of organics with
/C5OH are progressively enhanced in front of non-oxidi-
zing reactions of this radical.
The above ﬁndings allow concluding that concen-
trated paracetamol solutions can be eﬃciently mineral-
ized by anodic oxidation with BDD, even at lowcurrents. This method can then be useful in practice,
increasing its eﬃciency as temperature raises.
3.4. Paracetamol decay and time-course of products
The kinetics for the reaction between paracetamol
and
/C5OH generated at the Pt or BDD anode was stu-
died for several solutions of pH 3.0 and 12.0 at
300mA and at 35 /C176C. The decay of its concentration
was followed by reversed-phase chromatography, where
it displayed a well-deﬁned peak at a retention time
tr= 1.56min.
As can be seen in Fig. 3 a, the drug is slowly destroyed
with similar rate at a given concentration for both pH
values when Pt is used, disappearing from the medium
in 300–360min for 315mgl/C01and/C25240min for 157
and 78mgl/C01. Kinetic analysis of these results only gave
good linear plots, with regression coeﬃcients >0.996,
when they were ﬁtted to a pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction.
These correlations are presented in the inset of Fig. 3 a,
yielding the same pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant of
0.013 ± 0.002min/C01. This suggests that paracetamol re-
acts with a practically constant concentration of/C5OH at
the Pt surface, discarding its higher generation in alkaline
medium by the participation of reaction (2), proposed
above as a possibility to explain the greater TOC removal
found under these conditions than in acid medium (see
Fig. 1 ). The pH-independence of the pseudo-ﬁrst-order
rate constant for paracetamol (p Ka= 9.5) indicates thepresence of the same electroactive species in all media,
probably its neutral (not charged) form. It seems then
plausible to associate the quicker mineralization of the
drug in alkaline medium with the production of more
easily oxidizable products than those formed in acid
solutions, as also stated in Section 3.1.
Fig. 3 b shows a complex fall of paracetamol concen-
tration with time using BDD, without following any ki-
netic equation related to simple reaction orders. A quitesimilar degradation rate for this drug can be observed
for pH 3.0 and 12.0 at each initial concentration tested,
as also obtained for Pt (see Fig. 3 a), corroborating the
oxidation of the same electroactive form of paracetamol
in both media. However, comparison of Fig. 3 a and b
allows establishing that it is more rapidly destroyed with
BDD, requiring lower times close to 240, 150 and120min for 315, 157 and 78mgl
/C01, respectively, to yield
its complete removal, in agreement with the higher oxi-
dizing power of this anode. The complex kinetics de-
picted in Fig. 3 b can then be related to the competitive
consumption of/C5OH at the BDD surface by parallel fast
reactions with products. This causes the attack of a vari-
able/C5OH concentration on the initial compound giving
an undeﬁned kinetics.

ȱReversed-phase chromatograms of solutions electro-
lyzed with Pt also exhibited two small peaks associated
with primary product hydroquinone at tr= 1.62min
and its oxidation derivative p-benzoquinone at tr=
1.95min. Note that both aromatic products have been
detected during the oxidation of paracetamol by ozona-
tion and H 2O2/UV in the pH range 2.0–5.5 ( Vogna et al.,
2002; Andreozzi et al., 2003 ). Hydroquinone can be pro-
duced from/C5OH attack on the C(1) position of aromatic
ring of paracetamol, causing the breaking of the C(1)–N
bond with the release of acetamide. However, the above
aromatics were not detected in the reversed-phase chro-
matograms of solutions treated with BDD, as expected
if they are so rapidly destroyed on the anode that arenot accumulated in the medium. This supports the exist-
ence of competitive
/C5OH consumption by parallel oxidiz-
ing reactions of all pollutants leading to a complexkinetics for paracetamol, as shown in Fig. 3 b.
The above solutions treated with BDD were also ana-
lyzed by ion-exclusion chromatography to try to detect
generated carboxylic acids. In all cases, only two ulti-
mate acids, oxalic (HOOC–COOH) at t
r= 6.75min
and oxamic (HOOC–CONH 2)a t tr= 9.29min, were
found. Oxalic acid come from the destruction of the
benzenic ring of aromatic pollutants by/C5OH ( Brillas
et al., 1998, 2003; Boye et al., 2002 ), while oxamic acid
is expected to be produced from oxidation of acetamidereleased during the primary
/C5OH attack on the C(1) posi-
tion of paracetamol. The evolution of such carboxylic
acids during the treatments of solutions with 157mgl/C01
of this compound of pH 3.0 and 12.0 at 300mA and at
35/C176C is presented in Fig. 4 . A small, but similar, accu-
mulation of both acids can be observed in the two
media, reaching their maximum concentrations between
60 and 90min and disappearing in 240min, a time lowerthan 300–360min needed for total mineralization (see
Fig. 1 ). These results, along with those found for para-
cetamol in Fig. 3 b, corroborate the fast and similar
destruction rate of all organics on BDD in acid andalkaline solutions, thus justifying the pH-independence
for their TOC decay (see Fig. 1 ).
4. Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that anodic oxidation with
BDD is a very eﬀective method for the complete miner-
alization of paracetamol up to 1gl
/C01in aqueous med-
ium within the pH range 2.0–12.0. The TOC removalis pH-independent since the destruction of all organics
by reaction with the great concentration of
/C5OH at the
BDD surface has a similar rate in all media tested. Thishas been conﬁrmed by the similar decay found for its
concentration at pH 3.0 and 12.0 by reversed-phase
chromatography, as well as by the analogous evolution
of oxalic and oxamic acids detected as ultimate products
in the same solutions by ion-exclusion chromatogra-
phy. The mineralization process is accompanied by the
release of NH
þ
4and NO/C0
3ions. Its current eﬃciency in-
creases with raising drug concentration and tempera-
ture, because of the gradual enhancement of/C5OH
concentration to oxidize pollutants in front its participa-
tion in non-oxidizing reactions. The increase in current
causes generation of more/C5OH, and hence, more TOC
removal, but eﬃciency drops since a larger proportion
of this radical is wasted. Paracetamol decay follows acomplex kinetics, ascribed to its reaction with a variable
/C5OH concentration caused by the parallel consumption
of this oxidant in fast reactions with products. In con-trast, anodic oxidation with Pt has much lower oxidizing
power and yields poor mineralization, although a higher
TOC removal is reached in alkaline than in acid med-
ium. This fact is related to the production of more easily
oxidizable products in alkaline media. The treatment of
concentrated solutions favors polymerization of inter-
mediates, limiting the mineralization process. Paraceta-
mol can be completely removed with Pt and its
kinetics follows a pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction with a con-
stant rate independent of pH, as expected if the same
electroactive species of this compound is oxidized in
all media tested.

InȱtheȱcaseȱofȱEFȱandȱPEFȱthisȱtrendȱisȱattributed ȱtoȱtheȱenhanced ȱproduction ȱofȱOHȱ

canȱbeȱascribedȱagainȱtoȱtheȱlargerȱproportion ȱofȱOH adsȱoxidized ȱtoȱO2ȱatȱtheȱanode,ȱ

whenȱIȱincreases, ȱasȱcouldȱbeȱinferredȱfromȱtheȱaforementioned ȱcomment: ȱasȱIȱ

Abstract
Aqueous solutions containing the metabolite cloﬁbric acid (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid) up to close to saturation in the pH
range 2.0–12.0 have been degraded by anodic oxidation with Pt and boron-doped diamond (BDD) as anodes. The use of BDD leads to total
mineralization in all media due to the efﬁcient production of oxidant hydroxyl radical (•OH). This procedure is then viable for the treatment of
wastewaters containing this compound. The effect of pH, apparent current density, temperature and metabolite concentration on the degradation rat e,
consumed speciﬁc charge and mineralization current efﬁciency has been investigated. Comparative treatment with Pt yields poor decontaminationwith complete release of stable chloride ion. When BDD is used, this ion is oxidized to Cl
2. Cloﬁbric acid is more rapidly destroyed on Pt than
on BDD, indicating that it is more strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface enhancing its reaction with•OH. Its decay kinetics always follows a
pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction and the rate constant for each anode increases with increasing apparent current density, being practically independen to f
pH and metabolite concentration. Aromatic products such as 4-chlorophenol, 4-chlorocatechol, 4-chlororesorcinol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone
and 1,2,4-benzenetriol are detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and reversed-phase chromatography. Tartronic, maleic,fumaric, formic, 2-hydroxyisobutyric, pyruvic and oxalic acids are identiﬁed as generated carboxylic acids by ion-exclusion chromatography. The se
acids remain stable in solution using Pt, but they are completely converted into CO
2with BDD. A reaction pathway for cloﬁbric acid degradation
involving all these intermediates is proposed.

1. Introduction
The presence of drugs and their metabolites as emerging
pollutants in the aquatic environment has been recently docu-mented [1–13] . A fairly large number of these compounds such

out the water in ﬁsh and other animal farms and inadequatetreatment of manufacturing waste [10]. Widespread contamina-
tion is produced when drugs are recalcitrant towards degradationand can only be partially removed in sewage treatment plants.Powerful oxidation methods are then needed to be applied to
ensure the complete degradation of drugs and their metabolites
in waters to avoid their potential adverse health effects on both,humans and animals.
Anodic oxidation is one of the most promising electrochem-
ical technologies for the treatment of wastewaters with lowcontents of organic pollutants. In this method contaminants aredestroyed by reaction with adsorbed hydroxyl radical (

generated at the surface of a high O 2-overvoltage anode from

Hydroxyl radical is a non-selective, very powerful oxidiz-
ing agent able to react with organics giving dehydrogenated or
hydroxylated by-products until their total mineralization, i.e.,their overall transformation into CO
2, water and inorganic ions.
The recent use of a boron-doped diamond (BDD) thin-ﬁlm
electrode in anodic oxidation has shown that it possesses techno-
logically important characteristics such as an inert surface withlow adsorption properties, remarkable corrosion stability andan extremely wide potential window in aqueous medium [17].
This electrode has much greater O
2-overvoltage than a Pt anode,
yielding quicker oxidation of most organics. This has been con-
ﬁrmed from recent studies showing the total mineralization ofseveral aromatics and short carboxylic acids in waters from elec-trolysis with a BDD anode [15–36] . The use of anodic oxidation
with BDD then seems an adequate technique for the treatmentof wastewaters containing toxic and biorefractory organic pol-lutants.
In previous work we have reported that anodic oxi-
dation with BDD can destroy toxic chlorophenoxy acidssuch as 4-chlorophenoxyacetic [23] and 4-chloro-2-
methylphenoxyacetic, 2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propionic
and 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic (cloﬁbric acid)
[36] in 1 M HClO
4. The degradation of 4-chlorophenoxyacetic,
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic and 2,4,6-trichlorophenoxyacetic
acids in acid aqueous solutions of pH 2.0–6.0 using this tech-nique has also been investigated [28]. Among these compounds,
cloﬁbric acid has relevant environmental interest due to itssigniﬁcant accumulation and large persistence in waters. It isthe active metabolite of cloﬁbrate, etoﬁbrate and etofyllinecloﬁ-brate, which are drugs widely used as blood lipid regulatorswith therapeutic doses of about 1–2 g day
−1per person, since
they decrease the plasmatic concentration of cholesteroland triglycerides [3,37] . Cloﬁbric acid concentrations up
to 10/H9262gl
−1have been detected in sewage treatment plant
inﬂuents and efﬂuents and in rivers, lakes, North Sea, ground
and drinking waters [1–3,9] . Several papers have described that
this compound is poorly mineralized in aqueous medium bydifferent oxidation methods such as electrogenerated Fenton’sreagent [38], ozone [8,39] ,H
2O2/UV [39], sunlight and UV
photolysis [40] and TiO 2/UV [41], as well as after application
of different biological and physico-chemical methods in sewagetreatment plants [37,42] .
This paper reports a detailed study on the electrochemical
degradation of aqueous solutions of cloﬁbric acid, as a model ofchlorophenoxy compounds, in the pH range 2.0–12.0 to knowthe characteristics of its anodic oxidation with BDD for the pos-sible application of this method to the treatment of wastewaterscontaining such kind of compounds. The effect of pH, appar-ent current density, temperature and cloﬁbric acid concentrationup to close to saturation on the degradation rate, consumed spe-
ciﬁc charge and mineralization current efﬁciency was examined.
The metabolite decay and the evolution of its by-products werefollowed by chromatographic techniques. Comparative experi-ments with a Pt anode were also made, since the metabolite is
mineralized in smaller extent than with the BDD one, allow-ing a better interpretation of its kinetic behavior and a clearerdetection of by-products produced during its degradation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Cloﬁbric acid, 4-chlorophenol, 4-chlororesorcinol, hydro-
quinone, p-benzoquinone and 1,2,4-benzenetriol were reagent
grade, with purity >97%, supplied by Sigma–Aldrich, Merck,Panreac and Avocado. 4-Chlorocatechol was synthesized bychlorination of pyrocatechol with SO
2Cl2at room tempera-
ture following a standard method reported in the literature
[43]. 2-Hydroxyisobutyric, maleic, fumaric, pyruvic, tartronic,
formic and oxalic acids were either reagent or analytical gradefrom Sigma–Aldrich, Panreac and Avocado. Anhydrous sodiumsulfate used as background electrolyte was analytical gradefrom Fluka. All solutions were prepared with high-purity waterobtained from a Millipore Milli-Q system with resistivity>18 M /Omega1cm at 25
◦C. The initial solution pH was adjusted with
sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide, both of analytical grade,
purchased from Merck or Fluka, respectively. Organic solvents
and the other chemicals utilized were either HPLC or analyticalgrade from Merck and Fluka.
2.2. Instruments
Electrolyses were carried out with an Amel 2053 potentiostat-
galvanostat. The solution pH was measured with a Crison2000 pH-meter. Aromatic intermediates were identiﬁed by gaschromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) with a Hewlett-
Packard system composed of a HP 5890 Series II gas chro-
matograph ﬁtted with a HP-5 0.25 /H9262m, 30 m ×0.25 mm, col-
umn and coupled with a HP 5989A mass spectrometer oper-ating in EI mode at 70 eV . The temperature ramp was 35
◦C
for 2 min, 10◦C min−1up to 320◦C and hold time 5 min,
and the temperatures of the inlet, transfer line and detector
were 250, 250 and 290◦C, respectively. The degradation of
cloﬁbric acid solutions was monitored by the removal of their
total organic carbon (TOC), determined on a Shimadzu VCSNTOC analyzer. The metabolite decay and the evolution of itsaromatic intermediates were followed by reversed-phase chro-matography using a Waters 600 HPLC liquid chromatographﬁtted with a Spherisorb ODS2 5 /H9262m, 15 cm ×4.6 mm, column
at room temperature, coupled with a Waters 996 photodiodearray detector and controlled through a Millennium-32

gram. For each compound, this detector was selected at the
maximum wavelength of its UV-absorption band. Generatedcarboxylic acids were followed by ion-exclusion chromatog-raphy with the above chromatograph ﬁtted with a Bio-RadAminex HPX 87H, 30 cm ×7.8 mm, column at 35
◦C and with
the photodiode detector selected at λ= 210 nm. Cl−concen-
tration in treated solutions was determined by ion chromatog-raphy using a Shimadzu 10Avp HPLC chromatograph ﬁttedwith a Shim-Pack IC-A1S, 10 cm ×4.6 mm, anion column atPART B  –Results and Discussion -

2.3. Electrolytic system
All electrolyses were conducted in a one-compartment and
thermostated cylindrical cell of 100 ml capacity. The anode waseither a Pt sheet of 99.99% purity from SEMP or a BDD thin-ﬁlmdeposited on conductive single crystal p-type Si (1 0 0) wafersfrom CSEM, both of 3 cm
2of apparent area. The cathode was
always a 3 cm2stainless steel (AISI 304) sheet. The interelec-
trode gap was about 1 cm.
Solutions of 100 ml containing up to 0.56 g l−1of cloﬁbric
acid (close to saturation) and 0.05 M Na 2SO4in the pH range
2.0–12.0 were comparatively degraded using a Pt or a BDDanode at a constant apparent current density ( j
app) of 33, 100 and
150 mA cm−2and at 35.0◦C. The effect of temperature between
25.0 and 45.0◦C was also studied. All solutions were vigorously
stirred with a magnetic bar during treatment. The pH value ofsolutions starting from initial pH between 3.0 and 10.0 decreasedwith electrolysis time and then, it was continuously regulated
within a range of ±0.03 units by adding small volumes of 0.1 M
NaOH.
2.4. Analytical procedures
To identify the aromatic products, several 179 mg l
−1cloﬁb-
ric acid solutions of pH 3.0 and 12.0 were electrolyzed witha Pt anode at 100 mA cm
−2and at 35.0◦C for 60 and 40 min,
respectively, and their organic components were extracted with45 ml of CH
2Cl2in three times. Each collected organic solution
was then dried with anhydrous Na 2SO4, ﬁltered and its volume
reduced to about 5 ml to concentrate the remaining products forfurther analysis by GC–MS.
Before TOC and chromatographic analyses, all samples with-
drawn from electrolyzed solutions were ﬁltered with 0.45 /H9262m
Whatman PTFE ﬁlters. Reproducible TOC values were alwaysobtained by injecting 100 /H9262l aliquots into the TOC analyzer,
using the standard non-purgeable organic carbon method. From
these data, the mineralization current efﬁciency (MCE) for
treated solutions at a given time twas calculated from the fol-
lowing equation:
MCE=/Delta1(TOC)
exp
/Delta1(TOC) theor×100 (3)
where /Delta1(TOC) expis the experimental solution TOC removal at
time tand/Delta1(TOC) theoris the theoretically calculated TOC decay
considering that the applied electrical charge (=current ×time)
is only consumed in the mineralization process of cloﬁbric acid.
Reversed-phase chromatography of initial and treated
solutions was made by injecting 20 /H9262l samples into the
HPLC chromatograph under circulation of a 50:47:3 (v/v/v)
methanol/0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 2.5)/pentanol mixture at1.0 ml min
−1as mobile phase. For ion-exclusion chromatogra-
phy, 20 /H9262l samples were also injected into the HPLC chromato-
graph and the mobile phase was 4 mM H 2SO4at 0.6 ml min−1.
Cl−measurements were carried out with a 2.5 mM phtalic acidand 2.4 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane solution of pH
4.0 as mobile phase at 1.5 ml min−1. The concentration of H 2O2
accumulated in electrolyzed solutions was obtained from the
light absorption of the titanic-hydrogen peroxide colored com-plex at λ= 408 nm [44], measured with a Unicam UV4 Prisma
double-beam spectrometer thermostated at 25.0
◦C. The con-
centration of total oxidants generated in the same solutions wasdetermined by iodometric titration [21].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. TOC removal using a BDD or Pt anode
A series of electrolyses was carried out with 179 mg l
−1
cloﬁbric acid solutions (corresponding to 100 mg l−1of TOC) in
the pH range 2.0–12.0 at 100 mA cm−2and at 35.0◦C for 7 h to
test their comparative degradation by anodic oxidation with Ptand BDD. In the experiments performed with initial pH between3.0 and 10.0, the solution pH underwent a progressive decay tolower values with time due to the formation of acidic productsand hence, it was continuously regulated to its initial pH with0.1 M NaOH. All solutions treated with the BDD anode alwaysremained colorless, but their degradation with the Pt one causeda change in color, being pale pink at 5 min, orange at about 1 h,dark-brown at ca. 2 h and yellow at approximately 4 h, furtherbeing slowly decolorized up to become colorless again after 6 hof treatment. The coloration of solutions degraded with Pt can berelated to the generation of soluble polyaromatics in large extent,which can be totally destroyed by oxidant
•OH produced by
reaction (1)or(2). These colored products are not accumulated
in the medium using BDD, probably due to the faster destructionof aromatic intermediates.
The variation of solution TOC with applied speciﬁc charge
(Q,i nAhl
−1) for the above trials is depicted in Fig. 1 . A contin-
uous and quick TOC abatement can be observed for all solutionstreated with BDD, being reduced by more than 91% at 7 h

(Q=2 1Ahl−1) in all cases. These results indicate that cloﬁbric
acid and its by-products are destroyed at similar rate in the pHrange 2.0–12.0 by anodic oxidation with BDD. This behavior
can be explained by the generation of similar concentration of
•OH from reaction (1)or(2). Note that overall mineralization
(>97% TOC decay) is achieved starting from pH 3.0 and from
pH 12.0, where the degradation rate is slightly faster. In con-
trast, Fig. 1 also shows that both solutions are slowly degraded
with Pt up to reach near 30% of mineralization at 4 h, whereasat longer time they are not practically decontaminated. Conse-quently, under comparable conditions the use of a Pt anode yieldsquite poor mineralization of cloﬁbric acid solutions. That meansthat Pt is unable to destroy some products that are hardly oxidiz-able with
•OH, as short carboxylic acids, as will be discussed
below.
The possible effect of apparent current density and tempera-
ture on the degradation rate of the above cloﬁbric acid solutionstaking place in anodic oxidation with BDD was studied to clarifythe oxidation ability of this anode. As an example, Fig. 2 presents
the TOC– Qplots obtained for pH 3.0 and 12.0 at 33, 100 and
150 mA cm
−2and at 35.0◦C. The TOC of both solutions decays
at similar rate for each japp, conﬁrming that the degradation of
the metabolite and its by-products is practically pH-independent.
However, increasing jappcauses faster TOC removal with time
and more consumption of speciﬁc charge for total mineraliza-
tion, which varies from 1 0Ahl−1at 33 mA cm−2t o2 7Ahl−1
at 150 mA cm−2. This corresponds to a drop in time required
for overall decontamination from 10 to 5.5 h since TOC is more
rapidly removed with time. Fig. 2 also shows that an increase
in temperature from 25.0 to 45.0◦C working at pH 12.0 and at
100 mA cm−2also accelerates the degradation process, decreas-
ing the time for total mineralization from 10 to 6 h, with a
concomitant fall in Qfrom 30 to 1 8Ahl−1.
The change in TOC abatement with varying jappand tem-
perature can be explained taking into account that in Na 2SO4

medium other weaker oxidants such as ozone, peroxodisulfate
ion and H 2O2can be competitively formed with•OH at the BDD
anode from the following reactions [17]:
3H2O→O3+6H++6e−(4)
2HSO 4−→S2O82−+2H++2e−(5)
2H2O→H2O2+2H++2e−(6)
where H 2O2generation in reaction (6)can proceed via•OH
recombination. To know the inﬂuence of such electrogeneratedspecies on the mineralization of cloﬁbric acid, the concentra-tions of H
2O2and total oxidants (ozone, S 2O82−and H 2O2)
were determined during the treatment of 100 ml of 179 mg l−1
cloﬁbric acid solutions of pH 3.0 at several apparent current
densities and temperatures. The results obtained are shown inFig. 3 , where the difference between the concentration of total
oxidants and H
2O2mainly corresponds to that of S 2O82−.A
gradual accumulation of all species can be always observed,attaining a quasi-steady concentration usually from 4 h of elec-trolysis, just when they are generated and destroyed at the samerate. An increase in j
appfrom 33 to 100 mA cm−2at 25.0◦C leads
to the formation of more weak oxidants due to the accelerationof reactions (4)–(6) , indicating the existence of a mass-transport
controlled process. However, part of these species is consumedwhen the temperature increases to 45.0
◦Ca t3 3m Ac m−2, indi-
cating that increasing temperature enhances their decompositionand/or their reaction with greater amount of organics accelerat-ing their oxidation. Note that no electrogenerated oxidants weredetected when comparable solutions were degraded with Pt.
From the above ﬁndings, the fact that TOC is more rapidly
removed with time when j
appraises for the 179 mg l−1cloﬁbric
acid solutions of pH 3.0 and 12.0 can be ascribed to the higherproduction of
•OH from reaction (1)or(2)and weaker oxidants
(ozone, S 2O82−and H 2O2) from reactions (4)–(6) , thus favoring
the degradation of organics. The increase in Qfor total miner-
alization under these conditions is indicative of a lower relativegeneration of the main oxidant
•OH due to its quicker oxida-PART B  –Results and Discussion -

tion to O 2. On the other hand, the faster TOC decay found when
temperature increases, as exempliﬁed in Fig. 2 for the metabolite
solution of pH 12.0 at 100 mA cm−2, can be explained by the
concomitant increase in mass transfer of pollutants towards theBDD anode due to the decrease of medium viscosity. This causesthe acceleration of their reaction with
•OH and weaker oxidants
such as ozone, S 2O82−and H 2O2, enhancing metabolite min-
eralization. It can then be inferred that the oxidation processis limited, at least partially, by the mass transfer of organics toBDD surface.
These results indicate that anodic oxidation with BDD is
potent enough to decontaminate wastewaters of cloﬁbric acidin a large variety of experimental conditions. The great oxi-dizing power of this method was conﬁrmed by electrolyzingsolutions with metabolite contents up to close to saturation
at 100 mA cm
−2and at 35.0◦C.Fig. 4 illustrates the fast and
total TOC abatement found for 45, 89, 179, 268, 358, 447 and557 mg l
−1of this compound at pH 12.0. Similar TOC– Qplots
were obtained for the same solutions at pH 3.0. As can be seen,the speciﬁc charge consumed for overall mineralization gradu-ally increases from 15 to 3 0Ahl
−1as initial concentration rises.
This trend can be, in principle, related to the existence of moreorganic matter in solution. However, increasing metabolite con-centration causes a quicker TOC abatement. For example, at
2 h of electrolysis ( Q=6Ahl
−1) 15, 28, 56, 81, 95, 101 and
121 mg l−1of TOC are removed starting from 45, 89, 179, 268,
358, 447 and 557 mg l−1of cloﬁbric acid, respectively. This
gradual enhancement in oxidizing power of the BDD anodecan be accounted for by the reaction of more
•OH with greater
amount of pollutants, and hence, this radical is wasted in smallerextent by other nonoxidizing reactions such as its decompositionto O
2and its recombination to H 2O2.
3.2. Mineralization current efﬁciency
Generation of inorganic ions from the initial chlorine of the
metabolite is expected during its mineralization process. Ionic

chromatographic analysis of all electrolyzed solutions revealed
the formation of chloride ion. However, the presence of other
chlorine–oxygen ions such as chlorite, chlorate and perchlorate
in treated solutions was not detected by this technique. As canbe seen in Fig. 5 ,C l
−is rapidly accumulated for 180–240 min
of anodic oxidation with Pt of 179 mg l−1cloﬁbric acid solu-
tions at both pH 3.0 and 12.0, operating at 100 mA cm−2and at
35.0◦C. At longer time than 360 min, this ion reaches a quasi-
steady concentration of about 29 mg l−1in both media, a value
practically equal to 29.5 mg l−1corresponding to the initial chlo-
rine contained in solution. All chloro-organics are then mainlydestroyed for 5–6 h of electrolysis, with the release of chlorideion. A very different behavior can be observed in Fig. 5 for the
evolution of Cl
−in the same solutions comparatively degraded
with BDD. In both media this ion attains a maximum concentra-tion of ca. 7 mg l
−1at 120 min and further, it is slowly destroyed
until disappearing at 420 min. The instability of Cl−under these
conditions can be explained by its oxidation to Cl 2gas on BDD,
as reported for the electrolysis of NaCl aqueous solutions withthis anode [45].
These ﬁndings allow establishing that the mineralization of
cloﬁbric acid by anodic oxidation with BDD involves its con-version into CO
2and chloride ion as primary inorganic ion. This
overall reaction can be written as follows:
C10H11ClO 3+17H 2O→10CO 2+Cl−+45H++44e−
(7)
where the destruction of each mole of the metabolite needs the
consumption of 44 F.
Taking into account reaction (7), the mineralization cur-
rent efﬁciency of solutions treated with BDD was determinedfrom Eq. (3). This parameter was found to be practically pH-
independent, although it strongly increased with increasing ini-
tial metabolite concentration and temperature, as well as withdecreasing apparent current density. To illustrate these trends,Fig. 6 presents the MCE– Qplots found for different cloﬁbricPART B  –Results and Discussion -

acid solutions of pH 12.0 at several jappvalues and at 35.0◦C. A
slight increase in efﬁciency can be observed at the early stages
of most treatments, as expected if a higher amount of pollutantsis converted more quickly into CO
2. This enhancement in MCE
can be accounted for by the faster degradation of some productsthat are able to react simultaneously with
•OH and with weaker
oxidants as ozone, S 2O82−and H 2O2produced from reactions
(4)–(6) . When electrolyses are prolonged, the efﬁciency always
undergoes a slow, but continuous, decay, as expected if productsthat are more difﬁcultly oxidizable with
•OH than the initial
compound, such as short carboxylic acids, are progressivelyformed. The slower production of such hardly oxidizable specieswith raising initial metabolite content can then justify the con-comitant increase in efﬁciency at constant j
app. This behavior
can be easily deduced from results of Fig. 6 , where, for example,
after 2 h ( Q=6Ahl−1) of electrolysis at 100 mA cm−2, increas-
ing MCE values of 2.5, 4.5, 8.9, 13, 16, 17 and 20% are obtainedfor increasing cloﬁbric acid concentrations of 45, 89, 179, 268,358, 447 and 557 mg l
−1, respectively. This tendency also con-
ﬁrms the gradual reaction of higher amount of•OH with more
pollutants, indicating that this radical is lost in smaller extent inother nonoxidizing reactions. Fig. 6 also shows a dramatic fall
in efﬁciency as higher j
appis applied, conﬁrming the existence
of a mass-transport controlled process. For example, the MCEvalues at 1 h of treatment of 179 mg l
−1of the metabolite are 18,
9.7 and 6.7% at 33, 100 and 150 mA cm−2, respectively. This
trend corroborates the progressive faster production of O 2and
other weak oxidants (ozone, S 2O82−and H 2O2), to the detri-
ment of the main oxidant•OH with increasing apparent current
density.
All these results allow concluding that concentrated cloﬁb-
ric acid solutions can be efﬁciently and totally mineralized by
anodic oxidation with BDD, even at low current, increasing its
efﬁciency as temperature rises. This method is then viable fortreating wastewaters containing this metabolite.3.3. Kinetics of cloﬁbric acid decay
To clarify whether cloﬁbric acid can be oxidized with H
2O2
and S 2O82−, chemical tests were carried out by preparing 100 ml
solutions with 179 mg l−1of this metabolite, 20 mM of each
one of these oxidants and 0.05 M Na 2SO4at pH 3.0 and 12.0.
The concentration of cloﬁbric acid in these experiments was
determined by reversed-phase chromatography, where it exhibits
a well-deﬁned absorption peak with a retention time ( tr)o f
7.6 min. However, no change in the metabolite content of solu-tions was found for 3 h at 35.0
◦C, indicating that it does not react
with such weak oxidants. That means that in anodic oxidation
this compound can only react with•OH.
The kinetics for the reaction between cloﬁbric acid and•OH
formed from reaction (1)or(2)at the Pt and BDD anodes was
comparatively studied with 179 mg l−1metabolite solutions of
pH 3.0 and 12.0 at different jappvalues and at 35.0◦C. The
change of its concentration with time is presented in Fig. 7 (a) and
(b). As can be seen in Fig. 7 (a), it disappears from the medium
at pH 12.0 after 420, 360 and 240 min of anodic oxidation withPt at 33, 100 and 150 mA cm
−2, respectively. However, longer

electrolyses time of about 540, 420 and 360 min is needed to
be removed under comparable conditions using BDD, as it isshown in Fig. 7 (b). This is surprising if one takes into account
that the BDD anode produces much more reactive
•OH able to
mineralize the metabolite and all intermediates, while the Pt one
is unable to destroy some by-products giving poor mineraliza-
tion (see Fig. 1 ). The greater oxidation ability of cloﬁbric acid
on Pt can then be ascribed to its higher adsorption on its surfacefavoring its reaction with more amount of
•OH. Note that the
time required for total destruction of this compound on BDD at
each applied jappis practically equal to that needed for its overall
mineralization (see Figs. 2 and 7(b) ), indicating that it persists
up to the end of its degradation process. Results of Fig. 7 (a) and
(b) also show a similar destruction rate for the metabolite at pH
3.0 and 12.0 and at 100 mA cm−2on each electrode. This brings
to consider that the same electroactive species of the metabolite
is oxidized in the pH range tested, probably its anionic (unpro-
tonated) form since its p Ka= 3.18 [40].
The above cloﬁbric acid concentration decays were well ﬁtted
to a pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetic equation. The excellent linear cor-relations obtained are depicted in the panel inset of Fig. 7 (a) and
(b). This behavior suggests the production of a constant concen-tration of
•OH from reaction (1)or(2)at each anode during
electrolysis, which is much greater than that of the metabo-
lite adsorbed on its surface. From this analysis, an increasingpseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant ( k)o f2 . 4 ×10

(R2= 0.995), 1.3 ×10−4s−1(R2= 0.991) and 1.8 ×10−4s−1
(R2= 0.994) for BDD is found at increasing jappof 33, 100
and 150 mA cm−2, respectively. Note that kdoes not vary
proportionally with japp, conﬁrming that a smaller proportion
of this oxidant reacts with pollutants when apparent current
density rises, since it is more quickly oxidized to O 2in both
anodes.
The possible inﬂuence of cloﬁbric acid concentration on
its decay kinetics was clariﬁed from electrolyses of differ-ent solutions of pH 12.0 at 100 mA cm
−2and at 35.0◦C. The
concentration–time plots obtained with Pt and BDD are shown in
Fig. 8 (a) and (b), respectively. Comparison of these data allows
concluding that the metabolite is always more quickly removedwith Pt, conﬁrming the existence of a greater adsorption of thiscompound on this anode that accelerates its reaction with
•OH.
Note that for all solutions treated with BDD, a similar time
is required for cloﬁbric acid disappearance and for its overallmineralization (see Figs. 4 and 8(b) ). This evidences the exis-
tence of simultaneous degradation of the initial pollutant andits intermediates under such conditions. Assuming a pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction kinetics for cloﬁbric acid, good straight lineswith R
2> 0.991 were found in all cases, as can be seen in the
inset of Fig. 8 (a) and (b). This analysis shows a rather similar
constant rate for all initial concentrations tested, correspond-ing to an average k-value of (4.0 ±0.6)×10
−4s−1for Pt and
(1.3±0.1)×10−4s−1for BDD. This behavior corroborates the
existence of a much greater amount of•OH than metabolite
adsorbed on each electrode surface, even operating with a con-
centration close to saturation.

3.4. Identiﬁcation and time-course of intermediates
The MS spectra obtained in the GC–MS analyses of organics
extracted after short-time electrolyses of 179 mg l−1metabo-
lite solutions of pH 3.0 and 12.0 with Pt at 100 mA cm−2and
at 35.0◦C, displayed three peaks associated with stable aro-
matic products such as 4-chlorophenol ( m/z= 128 (100, M+),
130 (33 ( M+2 )+)) at tr= 11.5 min, hydroquinone ( m/z= 108
(100, M+)) at tr= 13.2 min and p-benzoquinone ( m/z= 110 (45,
M+)) at tr= 6.5 min. Reversed-phase chromatograms of the
same degraded solutions exhibited peaks related to these com-pounds at retention time of 5.0, 1.7 and 2.0 min, respectively,along with other additional peaks ascribed to 4-chlorocatechol
at t
r= 3.1 min, 4-chlororesorcinol at tr= 2.3 min and 1,2,4-
benzenetriol at tr= 1.8 min. All these compounds were unequiv-
ocally identiﬁed by comparing their retention times and UV–visspectra, measured on the photodiode array, with those of pureproducts.
The evolution of aromatic intermediates in the above solu-
tions treated with Pt is shown in Fig. 9 (a). A much greater
accumulation of these products can be observed at pH 3.0 thanat pH 12.0, where only 1,2,4-benzenetriol and 4-chlorophenolPART B  –Results and Discussion -

the degradation of 100 ml of 179 mg l−1cloﬁbric acid solutions at 100 mA cm−2

are detected up to 20 and 120 min, respectively. At pH 3.0,
1,2,4-benzenetriol, 4-chlorocatechol and p-benzoquinone per-
sist to 420 min after reaching maximum contents of 4.5, 13.0
and 13.2 mg l−1at about 60 min, whereas 4-chlorophenol, 4-
chlororesorcinol and hydroquinone are more quickly destroyed,disappearing in 240 min. In contrast, reversed-phase chro-matograms of the same solutions degraded under the same con-
ditions with BDD only allowed the detection of 4-chlorophenol
and p-benzoquinone. As can be seen in Fig. 9 (b), both com-
pounds are present in the medium of pH 3.0 up to 420 min,i.e., a time similar to that of cloﬁbric acid disappearance (seeFig. 7 (b)), but only the ﬁrst product is accumulated up to 240 min
at pH 12.0. These ﬁndings indicate that the degradation of allaromatics, except the initial pollutant, is more rapid on BDD,
although they are completely degraded with both anodes.
Ion-exclusion chromatography of the above electrolyzed
solutions revealed the generation of carboxylic acids suchas oxalic at t
r= 6.6 min, tartronic at tr= 7.7 min, maleic at
tr= 8.1 min, pyruvic at tr= 9.2 min, 2-hydroxyisobutyric at
tr= 12.6 min, formic at tr= 14.0 min and fumaric at tr= 16.1 min.
Tartronic, maleic, fumaric and formic acids can be producedfrom the oxidative breaking of the benzenic moiety of aromatic
intermediates [16–18,25,28] , while 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid is
expected to be released when 4-chlorophenol is formed from
cloﬁbric acid. The pathway of the last product was clariﬁed from
the anodic oxidation with BDD of a solution with 50 mg l−1
of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid of pH 3.0 at 100 mA cm−2and at
35.0◦C. Under these conditions, this compound gives pyruvic
acid, which is further oxidized to oxalic acid. This acid can also
be generated from the independent degradation of longer chainacids as tartronic, maleic and fumaric [16,18,28] . Oxalic [30]
and formic acids are ﬁnally converted into CO
2.
The production and destruction rate of generated carboxylic
acids depends on both, pH and anode tested. Fig. 10 (a) shows
that large amounts of these products are slowly accumulatedusing Pt, without apparent degradation, as expected from thequite low mineralization achieved in these conditions (seeFig. 1 ). At pH 3.0 tartronic, 2-hydroxyisobutyric and oxalic
acids are the main products, whereas the two latter acids are alsolargely formed in the solution of pH 12.0. A different behavior
can be seen in Fig. 10 (b) for BDD, where all carboxylic acids
are destroyed at 420 min when total mineralization of starting

solutions is reached (see Fig. 2 ). Oxalic acid is the most largely
accumulated product in both media, although great amounts ofpyruvic acid at pH 3.0 and formic and maleic acids at pH 12.0
are also produced.
The balance of carbon content from detected pollutants
shown in Figs. 7, 9 and 10 was analyzed and compared with TOC
data given in Fig. 1 for 179 mg l
−1metabolite solutions of pH
3.0 and 12.0 at 100 mA cm−2. This study allows concluding that
the carbon content of solutions degraded with the BDD anode
practically corresponds to the remaining initial compound. For
example, after 60 min of both treatments, the resulting solu-tions contain about 73 mg l−1of TOC (see Fig. 1 ), which can
be ascribed to the main presence of ca. 70 mg l−1of carbon
coming from cloﬁbric acid, along with minor contribution of2 and 0.1 mg l
−1from 4-chlorophenol and 0.6 and 1.5 mg l−1
from oxalic acid at pH 3.0 and 12.0, respectively. A different
behavior is found for the Pt anode, where detected aromaticsand carboxylic acids lead to high carbon contents while cloﬁb-ric acid persists. Thus, after 60 min of degradation, the solution
TOC is close to 86 mg l
−1for both pH 3.0 and 12.0 (see Fig. 1 ),
but only ca. 23 mg l−1of carbon come from cloﬁbric acid and
some products signiﬁcantly contribute to the carbon content,PART B  –Results and Discussion -

for example, 4-chlorocatechol (7 mg l−1) and p-benzoquinone
(11 mg l−1) at pH 3.0 and 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (15 mg l−1)
at pH 12.0. When cloﬁbric acid disappears, 2-hydroxyisobutyric,
tartronic and oxalic acids always remain in both media, but at420 min all carboxylic acids only yield 48 and 25 mg l
−1of total
carbon at pH 3.0 and 12.0, respectively, values much lower than
about 63 mg l−1of TOC found for the resulting solutions (see
Fig. 1 ), thus indicating the formation of large amounts of other
undetected products, mainly at pH 12.0.
The above results evidence that different carboxylic acids,
mainly oxalic acid (see Fig. 10 (b)), and some aromatic inter-
mediates (see Fig. 9 (b)) are oxidized on BDD while cloﬁbric
acid is destroyed (see Fig. 7 (b)). These species are then present
in the medium during the degradation process of this metabo-lite. In contrast, generated carboxylic acids cannot be removedwith Pt (see Fig. 10 (a)) and then, they remain in the ﬁnal treated
solutions.
3.5. Proposed mineralization pathway
A plausible reaction sequence for the anodic oxidation of
cloﬁbric acid in aqueous medium is proposed in Fig. 11 . This
pathway includes all products detected using Pt and BDD asanodes, but carboxylic acids can only be destroyed on the lastelectrode, as pointed out above. Electrogenerated
•OH is stated
as the main oxidant, although the reaction of some organics withother weaker oxidants (ozone, S
2O82−and H 2O2) on BDD is
also possible.
The process starts with the breaking of the C(1)–O bond of
the metabolite to yield 4-chlorophenol and 2-hydroxyisobutyricacid. 4-Chlorophenol can then undergo a parallel attack of
•OH
on its C(2)-, C(3)- and C(4)-positions giving 4-chlorocatechol,4-chlororesorcinol and hydroquinone with loss of chloride ion,respectively. The subsequent hydroxylation with dechlorina-tion of 4-chlorocatechol and 4-chlororesorcinol leads to 1,2,4-benzenetriol. The last product can also be formed from
•OH
attack on hydroquinone, which is oxidized in parallel to p-
benzoquinone. Further degradation of 1,2,4-benzenetriol andp-benzoquinone yields a mixture of tartronic, maleic, fumaric
and formic acids. The three former acids are independentlytransformed into oxalic acid, which is also generated from theoxidation of the initially electrogenerated 2-hydroxyisobutyricacid via pyruvic acid. The ultimate carboxylic acids, oxalic andformic, are ﬁnally converted into CO
2.
4. Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that aqueous solutions of cloﬁb-
ric acid up to close to saturation can be completely mineralizedin the pH range 2.0–12.0 by anodic oxidation with BDD in a
large variety of experimental conditions due to the efﬁcient pro-
duction of oxidant
•OH by reaction (1)or(2). The removal
of solution TOC is practically pH-independent and becomesfaster with increasing j, although with consumption of more
speciﬁc charge, because of the higher production of this radicaland other weaker oxidants such as ozone, S
2O82−and H 2O2.The increase in temperature favors the degradation rate, indi-
cating that the process is limited, at least partially, by the masstransfer of organics to the BDD surface. Increasing metabo-lite concentration also enhances the oxidizing power of thisanode, since more
•OH is able to react with greater amount of
pollutants, decreasing the rate of other nonoxidizing reactions
of this oxidant. The mineralization current efﬁciency increases
with decreasing jappand with increasing initial metabolite con-
centration and temperature. Comparative treatment of the same
solutions with a Pt anode leads to poor mineralization, although
all chloro-organics are destroyed with release of chloride ion,which remains stable in solution. In contrast, this ion is com-pletely oxidized to Cl
2on BDD. The cloﬁbric acid decay always
follows a pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics, being quicker for Pt than
for BDD. This evidences a stronger adsorption of the metabolite
on the Pt surface that enhances its reaction with electrogener-ated
•OH. The pseudo-rate constant calculated for each anode
increases with increasing jappand it is practically independent of
pH and initial metabolite concentration. Aromatic products such
as 4-chlorophenol, 4-chlorocatechol, 4-chlororesorcinol, hydro-quinone, p-benzoquinone and 1,2,4-benzenetriol are detected by
GC–MS and reversed-phase chromatography. All these interme-diates are destroyed with both anodes, although they are morerapidly degraded on BDD. Generated carboxylic acids such astartronic, maleic, fumaric, formic, 2-hydroxyisobutyric, pyru-vic and oxalic are identiﬁed by ion-exclusion chromatography.While these acids remain stable in solution using a Pt anode,they are completely mineralized with the BDD one. Most ofthese species and some aromatic intermediates are simultane-
ously oxidized with cloﬁbric acid on BDD up to the end of its
degradation process.

Abstract
Acidic aqueous solutions of cloﬁbric acid (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid), the bioactive metabolite of various lipid-reg-
ulating drugs, have been degraded by indirect electrooxidation methods such as electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton with Fe2+as
catalyst using an undivided electrolytic cell with a Pt anode and an O 2-diﬀusion cathode able to electrogenerate H 2O2. At pH 3.0 about
80% of mineralization is achieved with the electro-Fenton method due to the eﬃcient production of oxidant hydroxyl radical from
Fenton’s reaction between Fe2+and H 2O2, but stable Fe3+complexes are formed. The photoelectro-Fenton method favors the photo-
decomposition of these species under UVA irradiation, reaching more than 96% of decontamination. The mineralization current eﬃ-
ciency increases with rising metabolite concentration up to saturation and with decreasing current density. The photoelectro-Fenton
method is then viable for treating acidic wastewaters containing this pollutant. Comparative degradation by anodic oxidation (without
Fe2+) yields poor decontamination. Chloride ion is released during all degradation processes. The decay kinetics of cloﬁbric acid always
follows a pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction, with a similar rate constant in electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton that increases with rising
current density, but decreases at greater metabolite concentration. 4-Chlorophenol, 4-chlorocatechol, 4-chlororesorcinol, hydroquinone,
p-benzoquinone and 1,2,4-benzenetriol, along with carboxylic acids such as 2-hydroxyisobutyric, tartronic, maleic, fumaric, formic and
oxalic, are detected as intermediates. The ultimate product is oxalic acid, which forms very stable Fe3+-oxalato complexes under electro-
Fenton conditions. These complexes are eﬃciently photodecarboxylated in photoelectro-Fenton under the action of UVA light.

1. Introduction
There is great interest in the environmental relevance of
pharmaceutical drugs and their metabolites as emerging pol-lutants in waters ( Daughton and Jones-Lepp, 2001; Ku ¨m-
merer, 2001; Heberer, 2002; Kolpin et al., 2002; Heberer
and Adam, 2004; Weigel et al., 2004; Tauxe-Wuerschet al., 2005 ). Diﬀerent anti-inﬂammatories, analgesics,
betablockers, lipid regulators, antimicrobials, antiepilepticsand estrogens have been detected in sewage treatment planteﬄuents, surface and ground waters and even in drinking
water at concentrations usually ranging from ng l
/C01to
lgl/C01. The sources of this pollution involve emission from
production sites, direct disposal of overplus drugs in house-holds, excretion after drug administration to humans and
animals, treatments throughout the water in ﬁsh and other
animal farms and inadequate treatment of manufacturingwaste. Among these compounds, cloﬁbric acid (2-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid, 1) has long term persis-
tence in the environment. It is the bioactive metabolite ofcloﬁbrate, etoﬁbrate and etofyllinecloﬁbrate, which are
drugs widely used as blood lipid regulators with therapeutic
doses of about 1–2 g d
/C01per person, since they decrease the

ment plant inﬂuents and eﬄuents and in rivers, lakes, North
Sea, ground and drinking waters ( Heberer and Stan, 1997;
Buser et al., 1998; Ternes, 1998; Tixier et al., 2003 ).
To avoid the potential adverse health eﬀects of drugs
and their metabolites as water pollutants on both humans
and animals, research eﬀorts are underway to develop eﬃ-
cient techniques for achieving their total destruction ( Zwie-
ner and Frimmel, 2000; Doll and Frimmel, 2004 ).
However, 1is poorly degraded by oxidation methods such
as ozonolysis ( Ternes et al., 2002; Andreozzi et al., 2003 ),
H2O2/UV ( Andreozzi et al., 2003 ), sunlight and UV pho-
tolysis ( Packer et al., 2003 ) and TiO 2/UV ( Doll and
Frimmel, 2004 ), as well as after application of diﬀerent bio-
logical and physico-chemical methods in sewage treatmentplants ( Tauxe-Wuersch et al., 2005 ). More potent oxida-
tion procedures are then needed to be applied to destroythis compound in wastewaters.
Recently, indirect electrooxidation methods such as elec-
tro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton are being developed
for wastewater remediation. In these environmentally clean
electrochemical techniques, hydrogen peroxide is continu-ously generated in an acidic contaminated solution from
the two-electron reduction of O
2at reticulated vitreous car-
bon ( Xie and Li, 2006 ), mercury pool ( Ventura et al.,
2002), carbon-felt ( Oturan et al., 1999; Go ¨zmen et al.,
2003; Hanna et al., 2005; Irmak et al., 2006 )a n dO 2-diﬀu-
sion ( Boye et al., 2002; Brillas et al., 2004a,b; Sire ´s et al.,
2006) cathodes:
O2+2 Hþ+2 e/C0!H2O2 ð1Þ
The oxidizing power of H 2O2is enhanced in the electro-
Fenton method by adding small amounts of Fe2+as cata-
lyst to the acidic solution. Hydroxyl radical (/C5OH) and Fe3+
are then generated from the classical Fenton’s reactionbetween Fe
2+and H 2O2(Sun and Pignatello, 1993 ):
Fe2þ+H 2O2!Fe3þ+/C5OH + OH/C0ð2Þ
Reaction (2)is propagated from Fe2+regeneration,
which mainly occurs by reduction of Fe3+species at the
cathode ( Oturan et al., 1999 )./C5OH acts as a non-selective,
strong oxidant, with ability to react with organics yieldingdehydrogenated or hydroxylated derivatives until theiroverall mineralization (conversion into CO
2, water and
inorganic ions). In the photoelectro-Fenton process the
solution is irradiated with UVA light to favor: (i) the pho-
todecomposition of complexes of Fe3+with generated car-
boxylic acids ( Zuo and Hoigne ´, 1992; Brillas et al., 2004a,b;
Sire´s et al., 2006 ) and (ii) the regeneration of Fe2+from
additional photoreduction of Fe(OH)2+, which is the pre-
dominant Fe3+species in acid medium ( Sun and Pignatello,
1993):
Fe(OH)2þ+hm!Fe2þ+/C5OH ð3ÞReaction (3)also enhances the production of/C5OH and
hence, the mineralization of organics.
The electro-Fenton treatment of 100-ml solutions with
1m Mo f 1and 2 mM Fe2+in 0.01 M HCl has been previ-
ously reported by Oturan et al. (1999) , but these authors
only described its decay kinetics and the detection of some
initial aromatic products. To show the possible viability of
the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton methods toremove this metabolite in wastewaters, we have carried
out a detailed study on the degradation of acidic aqueous
solutions of 1in the pH range 2.0–6.0 using 1.0 mM Fe
2+
in both procedures. Comparative treatments in the absence
of this catalyst were also made to demonstrate the positiveoxidation action of
/C5OH formed from reaction (2). The
eﬀect of current density and cloﬁbric acid concentration
on the degradation process and current eﬃciency wasexplored. Aromatic products were identiﬁed by gas chro-matography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The decay of1and the evolution of its by-products were followed by
chromatographic techniques. The results obtained in this
study are reported herein.

elsewhere ( Boye et al., 2002 ). Analytical grade sulfuric acid
was purchased from Merck. Anhydrous sodium sulfateand heptahydrated ferrous sulfate were analytical grade

employed were either HPLC or analytical grade from
Panreac.
2.2. Apparatus and analysis procedures

0.45lm PTFE ﬁlters before analysis. The mineralization
of each solution of 1was monitored by the abatement of
its total organic carbon (TOC), determined on a ShimadzuVCSN TOC analyzer. Reproducible TOC values were
obtained from analysis of 100- ll aliquots using the stan-
dard non-purgeable organic carbon method. From these
data, the mineralization current eﬃciency (MCE) for elec-2 I. Sire ´s et al. / Chemosphere xxx (2006) xxx–xxxARTICLE IN PRESS

where D(TOC) expis the experimental TOC removal and
D(TOC) theor is the theoretically calculated TOC decay
assuming that the applied electrical charge (=current ·
time) is only consumed in the mineralization process of 1.
The decay of 1and the evolution of aromatic intermedi-
ates were followed by reversed-phase chromatography
using a Waters 600 HPLC liquid chromatograph ﬁtted with
a Spherisorb ODS2 5 lm, 150 ·4.6 mm (i.d.), column at
room temperature, and coupled with a Waters 996 photo-diode array detector, controlled through a Millennium-32
/C210
program. For each compound, this detector was selected atthe maximum wavelength of its UV-absorption band.
These analyses were made by injecting 20- ll aliquots into
the chromatograph and circulating a 50:47:3 (v/v/v) meth-anol/phosphate buﬀer (pH = 2.5)/pentanol mixture at1.0 ml min
/C01as mobile phase. Generated carboxylic acids
were followed by ion-exclusion chromatography by inject-ing 20- ll samples into the above HPLC chromatograph
ﬁtted with a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX 87 H, 300 ·7.8 mm
(i.d.), column at 35 /C176C. For these measurements, the photo-
diode detector was selected at 210 nm and the mobile phase
was 4 mM H
2SO4at 0.6 ml min/C01.C l/C0concentration in
electrolyzed solutions was determined by ion chromatogra-phy using a Shimadzu 10Avp HPLC chromatograph ﬁttedwith a Shim-Pack IC-A1S, 100 ·4.6 mm (i.d.), anion col-

conductivity detector. These measurements were carriedout with a 2.5 mM phtalic acid and 2.4 mM tris(hydroxy-
methyl)aminomethane solution of pH 4.0 as mobile phase
at 1.5 ml min
/C01.
A 100 ml-solution with 179 mg l/C01of1of pH 3.0 was
electrolyzed at 100 mA cm/C02and at 35.0 /C176C by electro-Fen-
ton with 1.0 mM Fe2+for 2 min. The resulting organics
were extracted with 45 ml of CH 2Cl2in three times. The
collected organic solution was dried with anhydrousNa
2SO4, ﬁltered and evaporated to about 2 ml. The
remaining products were separated and identiﬁed by
GC–MS using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II gas chro-matograph ﬁtted with a HP-5 0.25 lm, 30 m ·0.25 mm
(i.d.), column, and a Hewlett-Packard 5989 A massspectrophotometer operating in EI mode at 70 eV. Thetemperature ramp for this column was 35 /C176C for 2 min,
10/C176C min
/C01up to 320 /C176C and hold time 5 min, and the
temperature of the inlet, transfer line and detector was
250/C176C, 250 /C176C and 290 /C176C, respectively. To identify the
ﬁnal carboxylic acids, the above solution was treated under
the same electro-Fenton conditions for 6 h. The resultingsolution was evaporated at low pressure and the remainingsolid was dissolved in 2 ml of ethanol. The esteriﬁed acidswere further analyzed by GC–MS using the gas chromato-graph ﬁtted with a HP-INNOWax 0.25 lm, 30 m ·
0.25 mm (i.d.), column. In this case the temperature rampwas 35 /C176C for 2 min, 10 /C176C min
/C01up to 250 /C176C and hold
time 15 min, and the temperature of the inlet, transfer lineand detector was always 250 /C176C.
2.3. Electrolytic system
All electrolyses were conducted in an open, undivided
and thermostated cylindrical cell containing 100 ml of solu-tion stirred with a magnetic bar. The anode was a 3-cm
2Pt
sheet of 99.99% purity from SEMPSA and the cathode wasa 3-cm
2carbon-PTFE electrode from E-TEK, which was
fed with pure O 2at 12 ml min/C01to generate continu-
ously H 2O2from reaction (1). The electrolytic setup and
the preparation of the O 2-diﬀusion cathode have been
described ( Boye et al., 2002 ). For the experiments with
UVA irradiation, a Philips 6 W ﬂuorescent black light bluetube was placed at 7 cm above the solution. The tube emit-ted UVA light in the wavelength region between 300 and420 nm, with k
max= 360 nm, supplying a photoionization
energy input to the solution of 140 lWc m/C02, detected with
a NRC 820 laser power meter working at 514 nm. Both
electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton treatments were
performed after addition of 1.0 mM Fe2+to the solution.
All trials were carried out at 35.0 /C176C, which is the maxi-
mum temperature to work with the open electrolytic cellwithout signiﬁcant water evaporation from solution ( Boye
et al., 2002 ).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Comparative degradation
Comparative electrolyses at 100 mA cm
/C02for 6 h were
initially made for solutions containing 179 mg l/C01of1
(equivalent to 100 mg l/C01of TOC) and 0.05 M Na 2SO4
regulated with H 2SO4at pH 3.0 and at 35.0 /C176C. In these
experiments the solution pH remained practically constant,reaching ﬁnal values between 2.8 and 3.0. The change in
solution TOC with consumed speciﬁc charge ( Q,i nAhl
/C01)
for such trials is depicted in Fig. 1 a. Note that the electro-
lytic system produces continuously hydrogen peroxide
from reaction (1), whereas adsorbed/C5OH is formed at the
Pt anode from water oxidation ( Boye et al., 2002; Brillas
et al., 2004a,b; Sire ´s et al., 2006 ):
H2O!/C5OH ads+Hþ+e/C0ð5Þ
The use of this system without catalyst corresponds to
the method of anodic oxidation with electrogenerated
H2O2.Fig. 1 a shows that this procedure gives a quite slow
TOC removal, attaining 41% of mineralization at 6 h(Q=1 8Ahl
/C01). This behavior can be accounted for by
the low concentration of/C5OH formed at the Pt surface from
reaction (5), which is the main oxidant of 1and its by-prod-
ucts. A similar degradation rate can be seen in Fig. 1 a when
the solution without catalyst is illuminated with UVA light,
yielding 39% of TOC decay at the end of electrolysis. This
brings to consider that organics are not directly photode-I. Sire ´s et al. / Chemosphere xxx (2006) xxx–xxx 3ARTICLE IN PRESS

ȱcomposed by UVA light. A diﬀerent behavior can be
observed in Fig. 1 a when 1.0 mM Fe2+is added as catalyst.
For the electro-Fenton process, TOC is rapidly reduced by
79% at 6 h due to the fast reaction of organics with the great
amounts of/C5OH produced from Fenton’s reaction (2).I n
contrast, the photoelectro-Fenton process leads to quicker
TOC decay with almost overall mineralization (>96%TOC removal) at the end of electrolysis. This trend can berelated to: (i) the rapid photolysis of some stable complexes
of Fe
3+with generated carboxylic acids under electro-Fen-
ton conditions ( Zuo and Hoigne ´, 1992; Brillas et al., 2004a;
Sire´s et al., 2006 ) and/or (ii) the enhanced generation of/C5OH
from additional photoreduction of Fe(OH)2+from reaction
(3). Note that the starting pale yellow solution changed to
pale orange color at the end of both electro-Fenton and
photoelectro-Fenton degradations. This is indicative of
the formation of soluble colored polyaromatics in small
extent, which can be not be destroyed by oxidant/C5OH pro-
duced by reactions (2), (3) and (5) .
Mineralization of 1is accompanied by its overall dechlo-
rination. Ion chromatograms for the above treated solu-tions only displayed a deﬁned peak related to Cl
/C0ion. No
other chlorine–oxygen ions such as ClO/C0
3and ClO/C04were
detected by this technique. Fig. 1 b shows a gradual accumu-
lation of Cl/C0up to 23 mg l/C01for 4 h ( Q=1 2Ahl/C01)b y
anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H 2O2, whereas for
electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton, a Cl/C0concentra-
tion of about 25 mg l/C01is already attained at 40 min(Q=2Ahl/C01), whereupon it undergoes a slight drop due
to its oxidation to Cl 2at the Pt anode. These ﬁndings indi-
cate that chloro-organics are always degraded with release
of Cl/C0, although they are much more rapidly destroyed in
the two last methods. However, all procedures only lead
to the release of 78–85% of the initial chlorine content of
1(29.5 mg l/C01), suggesting that stable colored polyaromat-
ics formed during degradation contain the remainingchlorine.
These results indicate that electro-Fenton only yields
partial decontamination of 1, whereas this pollutant can
be almost completely mineralized by photoelectro-Fenton.
For this last technique, the eﬀect of pH, current density andmetabolite concentration on its oxidizing power was inves-
tigated to clarify its optimum operative conditions.
3.2. Eﬀect of experimental parameters on the photoelectro-
Fenton process
The TOC– Qplots obtained for solutions of 179 mg l
/C01
of1in the pH range 2.0–6.0 degraded by photoelectro-
Fenton at 100 mA cm/C02are depicted in Fig. 2 a. The pH
of solutions with initial pH 4.0 and 6.0 underwent a pro-
gressive decrease with time, mainly during the ﬁrst hour
of electrolysis, due to the generation of acid products and
for this reason, it was continuously regulated within a rangeof ±0.3 units by adding 1 M NaOH. Fig. 2 a shows that the
quickest TOC decay takes place starting from pH 3.0,whereas for the other solutions, the degradation rate fallsin the order pH 2.0 > pH 4.0 /C29pH 6.0. This behavior can
be associated with the highest generation rate of the main
oxidant
/C5OH from Fenton’s reaction (2), since its optimum
pH is 2.8 ( Sun and Pignatello, 1993 ), very close to pH 3.0
where 1and its by-products are more rapidly destroyed.
The inﬂuence of current density on the oxidation
ability of this method was examined by electrolyzing solu-
tions with 179 mg l/C01of1of pH 3.0 at 33, 100 and
150 mA cm/C02. As can be seen in Fig. 2 b, a progressive
increase in Qfrom 7 to 27 A h l/C01for achieving total
decontamination takes place when jincreases. However,
the time needed for overall mineralization drops from 7 hat 33 mA cm
/C02to 5.5 h at 150 mA cm/C02. The faster miner-
alization rate with time when jraises can be ascribed to a
greater production of/C5OH at the Pt anode from reaction
(5)and in the medium from reaction (2)due to the electro-
generation of more H 2O2by the O 2-diﬀusion cathode from
reaction (1)(Brillas et al., 2004a ). The increase in Qfor
total decontamination under these conditions is indicativeof a slower relative generation of oxidant
/C5OH due to the
acceleration of non-oxidizing reactions of this radical, forexample, its oxidation to O
2at the Pt anode and its recom-
bination into H 2O2.
The great oxidizing power of the photoelectro-Fenton
method was conﬁrmed by degrading up to 0.56 g l/C01(close
to saturation) of 1at pH 3.0 and at 100 mA cm/C02. The
TOC– Qplots thus obtained are shown in Fig. 2 c. As can
be seen, more than 96% of mineralization is achieved after020406080100120 TOC / m gl-1

consumption of 30 A h l/C01(10 h), 24 A h l/C01(8 h),
18 A h l/C01(6 h) and 15 A h l/C01(5 h) for 557, 358, 179 and
89 mg l/C01of1, respectively. The drop in Qwith decreasing
cloﬁbric acid concentration could be simply associated with
the presence of lower amount of organics. However, results
ofFig. 2 c evidence the removal of more TOC at a given
time with increasing initial pollutant content. For example,after 2 h of electrolysis, TOC is reduced by 33, 81, 143 and
218 mg l
/C01starting from 89, 179, 358 and 557 mg l/C01of1,
respectively. Since the same production of/C5OH is expected
from reactions (2), (3) and (5) in these trials, it seems plau-
sible to consider that its competitive non-oxidizing reac-
tions become slower and more/C5OH concentration can
then react with pollutants.
3.3. Mineralization current eﬃciency
The mineralization of 1yields carbon dioxide and Cl/C0as
ﬁnal products. The overall reaction can be written asfollows:C
10H11ClO 3+1 7 H 2O!10CO 2+C l/C0+ 45Hþ+ 44e/C0ð6Þ
Taking into account reaction (6)to calculate the theoret-
ical TOC removal, the mineralization current eﬃciency of
electrolyzed solutions was determined from Eq. (4). The
MCE values thus obtained for the diﬀerent treatments
reported in Fig. 1 a are depicted in Fig. 3 a. The eﬃciency
for both anodic oxidation procedures is very small, reach-ing a maximum value of 3.3–3.8% at 2 h ( Q=6Ahl
/C01), as
expected from their low oxidation ability. In contrast, this
parameter attains a value of 25% and 23% at the earlystages (20 min) of electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fentonprocesses, respectively. When electrolysis is prolonged, a
dramatic drop in MCE can be observed in Fig. 3 a for such
treatments, indicating the generation of products that aremore diﬃcultly oxidized with
/C5OH than the initial pollu-
tant. The eﬃciency for the photoelectro-Fenton methodis clearly higher from 1 h of electrolysis ( Q=3Ahl
/C01),
because it is able to destroy most products, including com-plexes of Fe
3+with generated carboxylic acids that are sta-
ble under electro-Fenton conditions.
For the photoelectro-Fenton treatment at the optimum
pH 3.0, the MCE value always decays with rising cur-rent density, as can be seen in Fig. 3 b. For example, after
1 h of electrolysis of 179 mg l
/C01of1, decreasing eﬃciencies
of 46% ( Q=1Ahl/C01), 20% ( Q=3Ahl/C01) and 14%
(Q= 4.5 A h l/C01) are found at increasing jvalues of 33,
100 and 150 mA cm/C02, respectively. This tendency corrob-
orates the enhancement of parallel non-oxidizing reactions
of/C5OH (e.g., its anodic oxidation to O 2and its recombina-TOC / mg l-1

ȱtion into H 2O2) when jraises, yielding a smaller proportion
of this oxidant with ability to destroy pollutants. Fig. 3 b
also illustrates that the eﬃciency for the photoelectro-
Fenton degradation at pH 3.0 and at 100 mA cm/C02
undergoes a progressive increase with rising metabolite
concentration, indicating the removal of larger amounts
of organics with/C5OH because its non-oxidizing reactions
become slower. Thus, the MCE values at 1 h(Q=3Ahl
/C01) are 8.2%, 20%, 32% and 45% for 89, 179,
358 and 557 mg l/C01of1, respectively. Under these condi-
tions, the highest eﬃciency of 50% is obtained at the begin-ning (20 min) of the degradation of the more concentrated
solution.
The above results allow concluding that the photoelec-
tro-Fenton method is viable for treating acidic wastewaters
containing cloﬁbric acid up to close saturation at optimumpH 3.0. This technique becomes more eﬃcient when thecontent of this pollutant increases and current density
decreases.
3.4. Cloﬁbric acid decay and kinetic analysis
The kinetics of the reaction between 1and
/C5OH gener-
ated in the diﬀerent methods tested was comparativelystudied by electrolyzing 179 mg l
/C01of this compound at
pH 3.0, at 100 mA cm/C02and at 35.0 /C176C. Its concentration
was determined by reversed-phase chromatography, where
it exhibits a well-deﬁned absorption peak with a retention
time ( tr) of 7.9 min. As can be seen in Fig. 4 a, the concen-
tration of 1undergoes a similar fall by anodic oxidation
without and with UVA irradiation, disappearing from
the medium in 240 min in both cases. This conﬁrms that1is not directly photolyzed by UVA light. Good straight
lines were obtained when the above concentration decays
were ﬁtted to a pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetic equation, as
depicted in the inset of Fig. 4 a. From this analysis, an aver-
age pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant ( k) of (4.7 ± 0.1) ·
10
/C04s/C01(square regression coeﬃcient, R2= 0.991) is found
for both anodic oxidation treatments. This behavior sug-
gests the production of a constant concentration of/C5OH
from reaction (5)at the Pt anode during electrolysis.
Fig. 4 b shows a much quicker decay of 1under compa-
rable electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton treatmentsof 179 mg l
/C01of1at 100 mA cm/C02, as expected if the pro-
duction of oxidant/C5OH from Fenton’s reaction (2)is much
greater than that of reaction (5)at the Pt anode. In both
cases 1is destroyed at a similar rate, being completely
removed in approximately 7 min. Kinetic analysis of thesedata also agrees with a pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction of the
metabolite (see inset of Fig. 4 b), leading to an average k-
value of (1.35 ± 0.10) ·10
/C02s/C01(R2= 0.996). This behav-
ior indicates a very low generation of/C5OH by reaction (3)
under the action of UVA light.
The concentration–time plots obtained for the photo-
electro-Fenton treatment of diﬀerent metabolite contents
and current densities at pH 3.0 are also presented inFig. 4 b. As can be seen, the complete removal of 1at100 mA cm
/C02is achieved at longer time when its initial
concentration rises. Thus, it disappears after 3, 7, 12 and18 min for 89, 179, 358 and 557 mg l
/C01, respectively. Their
kinetics analysis (see the inset of Fig. 4 b) gives decreasing
k-values of 3.88 ·10/C02s/C01(R2= 0.992), 1.26 ·10/C02s/C01
(R2= 0.997), 5.6 ·10/C03s/C01(R2= 0.996) and 4.3 ·
10/C03s/C01(R2= 0.995). The decay in kwith raising the con-
tent of 1indicates the gradual acceleration of competitive
reactions between/C5OH and by-products, thus enhancing
TOC removal and MEC values as experimentally found
(seeFigs. 2 ca n d 3b).Fig. 4 b evidences a more rapid decay
of 179 mg l/C01of1with rising jand their kinetic analysis
shows greater k-values of 6.5 ·10/C03s/C01(R2= 0.9996),
1.26·10/C02s/C01(R2= 0.997) and 1.81 ·10/C02s/C01(R2=
0.990) at higher current densities of 33, 100 and
150 mA cm/C02, respectively. Note that kdoes not vary
proportionally with j, conﬁrming the reaction of a smaller
proportion of/C5OH with pollutants when jrises, since it is
more quickly wasted by parallel non-oxidizing reactions.

ȱand the remaining organics were extracted and analyzed by
GC–MS. The MS spectrum displayed peaks related to sta-
ble aromatics such as 4-chlorophenol ( 2)(m/z= 128 (100,
M+), 130 (33, (M + 2)+)) at tr= 17.0 min, hydroquinone
(3)(m/z= 108 (100, M+)) at tr= 21.5 min, 4-chlorocate-
chol ( 5)(m/z= 144 (100, M+), 146 (33, (M+2)+)) at
tr= 18.2 min and p-benzoquinone ( 6)(m/z= 110 (53,
M+)) at tr= 4.1 min. In addition, an intense peak ascribed
to a chloro-derivative, with m/z= 214 (12, (M+2)+), 212
(36, M+), 184 (22), 169 (100) and 144 (49) as main frag-
mentation, was detected at tr= 14.2 min. Although this
product was not identiﬁed by pure standards, it can be rea-sonably assigned to a dehydrated species of 2-(4-chloro-2-
hydroxyphenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid ( 8), a hydroxyl-
ated product of 1that can be transformed into 5(molecular
peak = 144). The silylated derivatives of 2,3,5and 8were
also detected by GC–MS after derivatization with N,O-bis-
(trimetylsilyl)acetamide.
Reversed-phase chromatograms of treated solutions
exhibited peaks related to the products 2att
r= 5.0 min,
5attr= 3.1 min and 6attr= 2.0 min, along with other
additional peaks associated with 4-chlororesorcinol ( 4)a t
tr= 2.8 min and 1,2,4-benzenetriol ( 7)a ttr= 1.8 min. All
these aromatics were unequivocally identiﬁed by compar-ing their t
r-values and UV–vis spectra, measured on the
photodiode detector, with those of pure products. Note
that only 2,5and 6have been previously reported as prod-
ucts of 1during its electro-Fenton degradation in 0.01 M
HCl ( Oturan et al., 1999 ).
The evolution of aromatic intermediates during the
treatment of 179 mg l/C01of1at pH 3.0 and at 100 mA cm/C02
by anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H 2O2is shown
inFig. 5 a. Under these conditions, all products are poorly
accumulated and persist during long time, as expected fromthe slow removal of 1in 240 min (see Fig. 4 a). Compounds
5,6and 7are detected up to 300, 360 and 240 min, respec-
tively, after reaching 4.2, 2.1 and 2.8 mg l
/C01as maximum
at 30–40 min, whereas 2and 4attain ca. 2.5 mg l/C01at
30 min and disappear after 180 min. In contrast, the same
products are much more quickly formed and destroyed
under comparable electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fentondegradations due to the greater generation of
/C5OH from
reaction (2).Fig. 5 b shows that in both cases the prod-
uct2is accumulated up to 7.3 mg l/C01at 1 min and per-
sists to 10–12 min, whereas 5and 6are formed in smaller
extent and destroyed in 7 and 10 min, respectively. The
fact that all products show a similar evolution in both
electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes con-
ﬁrms that they are not photolyzed under UVA illumi-
nation.
Ion-exclusion chromatograms of electrolyzed solutions
showed well-deﬁned peaks ascribed to carboxylic acidssuch as 2-hydroxyisobutyric ( 9)a tt
r= 12.6 min, tartronic
(10)a t tr= 7.7 min, maleic ( 11)a t tr= 8.1 min, fumaric
(12)a ttr= 16.1 min, formic ( 13)a ttr= 14.0 min and oxa-
lic (14)a ttr= 6.6 min. Acids 10–13come from the oxida-
tion of the aryl moiety of aromatics ( Boye et al., 2002;Brillas et al., 2004a; Sire ´s et al., 2006 ), whereas 9is expected
to be released in the ﬁrst degradation stages of 1. This was
conﬁrmed from the GC–MS analysis of organics produced
after 2 min of the electro-Fenton treatment of 179 mg l/C01
of1at pH 3.0 and at 100 mA cm/C02, since the MS spectrum
after derivatization exhibited a peak of the disylilatedderivative of 9(m/z= 248 (10, M
+)) at tr= 10.2 min. The
photoelectro-Fenton treatment of 50 mg l/C01of9at pH
3.0, at 100 mA cm/C02and at 35.0 /C176C corroborated its oxida-
tion to acid 14. This acid can also be generated from the
independent degradation of 10–12(Sire´s et al., 2006 ). The
production of 13and 14as ultimate carboxylic acids was
conﬁrmed by electrolyzing 179 mg l/C01of1at pH 3.0 and
at 100 mA cm/C02under electro-Fenton conditions for 6 h.
The GC–MS analysis after esteriﬁcation of the remainingacids with ethanol revealed the presence of an intense peak
corresponding to diethyl oxalate ( m/z= 146 (2, M
+)) at
tr= 7.9 min, and a very weak peak related to ethyl formate
(m/z= 74 (10, M+)) at tr= 10.5 min.
As can be seen in Fig. 6 a for the anodic oxidation treat-
ment with electrogenerated H 2O2of 179 mg l/C01of1at pH
3.0 and at 100 mA cm/C02, large amounts of acids 9–14are
slowly accumulated without apparent degradation, except
for acid 10that reaches a maximum content of 57 mg l/C01
at 180 min. After 360 min of electrolysis, 23.8, 25.1,

ȱrespectively, corresponding to 11.0, 7.5, 1.5, 0.7, 2.9 and
3.8 mg l/C01of TOC, are found. This balance indicatesthat all detected carboxylic acids give 27 mg l/C01of soluble
TOC, a value much lower than 59 mg l/C01determined for
the ﬁnal degraded solution (see Fig. 1 a). That means that
this solution contains high contents of undetected prod-ucts, probably hardly oxidizable aromatics.
A very diﬀerent behavior is found for carboxylic acids in
the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes of
the above solution of 1. These products are rapidly
degraded by both treatments at 100 mA cm
/C02, so that only
the ultimate acid 14is largely accumulated (see Fig. 6 b),
although less than 0.1 mg l/C01of acid 13is also detected
at the end of electro-Fenton. Fig. 6 b illustrates that 9
and 13persist in large extent to ca. 60 min when smaller
amount of/C5OH is produced by photoelectro-Fenton at
33 mA cm/C02. In both methods complexes of acid 14with
Fe3+generated from reaction (2)are expected to be formed
(Zuo and Hoigne ´, 1992 ). These Fe3+-oxalato complexes are
diﬃculty oxidized with/C5OH in electro-Fenton, remaining
ca. 60 mg l/C01of14, corresponding to 16 mg l/C01of TOC,
at 360 min (see Fig. 6 b). Since the resulting solution con-
tains 21 mg l/C01of TOC (see Fig. 1 a), one can conclude that
the stable colored chlorinated polyaromatics formed yield
about 5 mg l/C01of TOC. In contrast, Fig. 6 b shows the
complete mineralization of acid 14in photoelectro-Fenton,
because Fe3+-oxalato complexes are eﬃciently photode-
carboxylated under the action of UVA light ( Zuo and
Hoigne ´, 1992 ). The remaining solution TOC (<4 mg l/C01,
Fig. 1 a) can then be ascribed to the stable colored
chlorinated polyaromatics generated during degradation

ȱ3.6. Proposed degradation pathway
Fig. 7 presents a plausible pathway for the degradation
of1by the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton pro-
cesses with Fe2+as catalyst. The sequence involves all
intermediates detected in this work, including those that
are only identiﬁed in anodic oxidation with electrogener-
ated H 2O2since they are quickly destroyed, without accu-
mulation, in the above methods. Electrogenerated/C5OH is
stated as the main oxidant and the possible parallel oxida-tion of complexes of Fe
3+with other products containing
OH groups, diﬀerent from acid 14, is not indicated for sake
of simplicity.
The process is initiated either by the breaking of the
C(1)–O bond of cloﬁbric acid to form the phenol 2with
loss of acid 9, or the direct hydroxylation on its C(2)-posi-
tion to give 8. Further parallel attack of/C5OH on the C(4)-,
C(3)- and C(2)-positions of 2yields the benzenediols 3,
with release of Cl/C0ion, 4and 5, respectively. Product 5
is also formed from the oxidation of 8with loss of acid
9. The subsequent hydroxylation with dechlorination of 4
and 5leads to the benzenetriol 7. This product is also
formed from/C5OH attack on 3, which is oxidized in parallel
to6. Further degradation of 6and 7leads to a mixture of
acids 10,11,12and 13. The latter acid is directly mineral-
ized to CO 2, whereas the three former ones are indepen-
dently transformed into acid 14, which is also generated
from the oxidation of 9. The ultimate carboxylic acid 14
is very slowly converted into CO 2by/C5OH since it forms
very stable Fe3+-oxalato complexes under electro-Fenton
conditions. These species can be photodecarboxylated with
loss of Fe2+under the action of UVA light ( Zuo and
Hoigne ´, 1992 ).
4. Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that the photoelectro-Fenton
method with Fe2+and UVA light as catalysts is able to
mineralize more than 96% of 1in aqueous medium of pH
3.0. Its eﬃciency rises with increasing metabolite content
and with decreasing j. This procedure is then viable for
treating acidic wastewaters containing this pollutant. Incontrast, the electro-Fenton method only yields about80% of decontamination due to the formation of productshardly oxidizable with
/C5OH, which is mainly formed from
reaction (2). Comparative treatment by anodic oxidation
with electrogenerated H 2O2conﬁrms that/C5OH is produced
in much smaller extent at the Pt anode from water oxida-tion. Cl
/C0ion is released during mineralization. The decay
of1always follows a pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics with simi-
lar rate constant for electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fen-
ton. Aromatic products and generated carboxylic acids
have been identiﬁed by GC–MS. From their quantiﬁcationby HPLC chromatography, the diﬀerent oxidation ability
of both methods can be explained from the behavior of
acid 14. This acid forms very stable Fe
3+-oxalato com-
plexes under electro-Fenton conditions, which can be eﬃ-ciently photolyzed to CO 2in photoelectro-Fenton under
the action of UVA light.

ȱDear Prof. X. Verykios, 
 I am sending you our paper entitled: “Mineralization of clofibric acid by electrochemical 
advanced oxidation processes using a boron-doped diamond anode and Fe2+ and UVA light as 
catalysts”, co-authored by E. Brillas, I. Sirés, F. Centellas, J.A. Garrido, R.M. Rodríguez, C. 
Arias and P.L. Cabot, for its publication i n Applied Catalysis B: Environmental.  This original paper deals with the degradation of a widely used drug as clofibric acid, a well-
known pollutant of t he aquatic environment, by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes 
(EAOPs) such as electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton. In these environmentally friendly 
techniques hydrogen peroxide is electrogenerated from an oxygen-diffusion cathode and its 
reaction with catalytic Fe
2+ produces hydroxyl radical (•OH) as strong oxidant of organic 
pollutants. The degradation is made using an undivided electrolytic cell with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode t hat also yields adsorbed hydroxyl radical (BDD(
•OH)). In the work the 
oxidizing ability of both kinds of hydroxyl radicals (•OH and (BDD(•OH)) are compared. Thus, 
electro-Fenton with 1.0 mM Fe2+ as catalyst is found as a very efficient method to mineralize 
rapidly and completely th is compound. Nevertheless, the overall min eralization is stron gly 
enhanced in the photoelectro-Fenton method with UVA irradiation since it photodecomposes 
Fe3+ complexes of some products. It should be noted that the use of photoelectro-Fenton with a 
BDD anode and Fe2+ and UVA light as catalysts has not been reported previously in the 
literature. The effect of applied current and clofibric acid concentration on the degradation rate and mineralization current efficiency of such EAOPs is examined to clarify their oxidation power. The kinetics of clofibric acid decay is followed by reversed-phase HPLC 
chromatography. Aromatic products are detected by GC-MS and also followed by this technique 
to discuss the initial reaction pathway of this compound. The quantification of final generated carboxylic acids by ion-exclusion chromatography shows that in photoelectro-Fenton UVA light enhances the photodegradation of Fe
3+-oxalato complexes, which are also oxidized with 
BDD(•OH), but not by •OH. Our results show clearly that the photoelectro-Fenton method is the 
most adequate EAOP for the remediation of wastewaters containing clofibric acid. From these 
considerations, we believe that this paper is of general and great interest for researchers in catalytic chemistry and electrochemical treatment of organic pollutants in waters and 
consequently, it can be published in Applied Catalysis B: Environmental.

2Abstract 1
2
 This work shows that aqueous sol utions of clofibric acid (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2- 3
methylpropionic acid), the bioactive metabolite of various lipid-regulating drugs, up to saturation at 4
pH 3.0 are efficiently and completely degraded by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes 5
such as electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton with Fe2+ and UVA as catalysts using an undivided 6
electrolytic cell with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and an O 2-diffusion cathode ab le to 7
electrogenerate H 2O2. This is feasible in these environmentally friendly methods by the production 8
of oxidant hydroxyl radical at the BDD surface from water oxidation and in the medi um from 9
Fenton's reaction between Fe2+ and electrogenerated H 2O2. The degradation process is accelerated 10
in photoelectro-Fenton by additional photolysis of Fe3+ complexes under UVA irradiation. 11
Comparative treatments by anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H 2O2, but without Fe2+, yield 12
much sl ower decontamination. Chloride ion is released and totally oxidized to chl orine at the BDD 13
surface in all treatments. The decay kinetics of clofibric acid always follows a pse udo-first-order 14
reaction. 4-Chlorophenol, 4-chlorocatechol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone and 2- 15
hydroxyisobutyric, tartronic, maleic, fumaric, formic and oxalic acids, are detected as intermediates. 16
The ultimate product is oxalic acid, which is slowly but progressively oxidized on BDD in anodic 17
oxidation. In electro-Fenton this acid forms Fe3+-oxalato complexes that can also be totally 18
destroyed at the BDD anode, whereas in photoelectro-Fenton the mineralization rate of these 19
complexes is enhanced by its parallel photodecar boxylation with UVA light. 20

31. Introduction 1

 The detection of a large variety of pharmaceutical drugs and metabolites including analgesics, 3
anti-inflammatories, antimicrobials, antiepileptics, beta-blockers, estrogens and lipid regulators as 4
emerging pollutants in waters at concentrations from nanograms to micrograms per litre has been 5
recently documented [1-10]. The main sources of this contamination include emission from 6
production sites, direct disposal of overplus drugs i n households, excretion after drug admi nistration 7
to humans and animals, treatments throughout the water in fish and other animal farms and 8
inadequate treatmen t of manufacturing waste [8]. To avo id the potential adv erse health effects of 9
these pollutants on living beings, research efforts are underway to develop efficient oxidation 10
techniques for achieving their total mineralization, i.e. their complete conversion into CO 2. 11
 Clofibric acid (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid) is the bioactive metabolite of 12
drugs such as clofi brate, etofibrate and etofyllineclofibrate, widely used as blood lipid regulators 13
because they decrease the plasmatic content of cholesterol and triglycerides [9]. This compound has 14
an estimated environmental persistence of 21 days [10] and has been found up to 10 µg l-1 in 15
sewage t reatment plant effluents, ri vers, lakes, North Sea, ground waters and drinking waters 16
[1,2,6]. However, it is poorly degraded by ozonation [5,11], H 2O2/UV [11], sunlight and UV 17
photolysis [7] and TiO 2/UV [12], as well as after application of biol ogical and physico-chemical 18
methods in sewage treatment plants [9]. In previous work [13] we have explored the 19
electrochemical degradation of cl ofibric acid solutions in the pH range 2.0-12.0 by means of the 20
classical method of anodic oxidation with a cell containing either a Pt or boron-doped diamond 21
(BDD) anode and a stainless steel cathode. Under these conditions, the metabolite solutions were 22
poorly decontaminated with a Pt anode, whereas the alternative use of BDD yielded their complete 23
mineralization, but with very low degradation rate and current efficiency. The greater oxidizing 24
power of BDD compared to Pt is ascribed  to  its higher O 2-overpotential, which allows the 25PART B  –Results and Discussion -

5
Under these conditions, other weaker oxidants such as peroxodisulfate ion, H 2O2 and O 3 at the BDD 6
anode are also produced [18]. Anodic oxidation with a BDD anode seems a viable technique to 7
mineralize clofibric acid, but its very low oxidation power prevents its possible application to the 8
treatment of industrial wastewaters containing this compound. This makes n ecessary the search of 9
other potent technologies with higher ability to remove this pollutant from waters. 10
 Recently, powerful indirect electrooxidation methods such as electro-Fenton and photoelectro- 11
Fenton are being developed for water remediation [19-31]. These electrochemical advanced 12
oxidation processes (EAOPs) are environmentally friendly technologies based on the continuous 13
supply of H 2O2 to an acidic contaminated solution from the two-electron reduction of injected O 2: 14

Reticulated vitreous carbon [19,20], carbon-felt [21,22,24,27,30], activated carbon fibre [28] and 18
O2-diffusion [23,25,26,29,31] cathodes are usually employed to reduce efficiently O 2 from reaction 19
(2). In the electro-Fenton process the oxidizing ability of electrogenerated H 2O2 is stron gly 20
enhanced by adding to the solution a small quantity of Fe2+ to produce hydroxyl radical (•OH) and 21
Fe3+ from the classical Fenton’s reaction [32]: 22
23
     F e2+  +  H 2O2→ Fe3+  +  •OH  +  OH−    (3) 24
25
An advantage of this method is that the Fe3+/Fe2+ system is catalytic and reaction (3) is propagated 26
from Fe2+ regeneration, mainly by reduction of Fe3+ at the cathode [21]. However, a part of 27PART B  –Results and Discussion -

In the phot oelectro-Fent on process, the treated solution is illuminated with UV light, which can also 8
act as catalyst to favor: (i) the photodecomposition of complexes of Fe3+ with generated carboxylic 9
acids [23,25,30,34] and/or (ii) the regeneration of more Fe2+ with additional production of •OH from 10
photoreduction of Fe(OH)2+, the predominant Fe3+ species in acid med ium [32]: 11

 This paper reports a comparative study on the degradation of clofibric acid by electro-Fenton 15
and photoelectro-Fenton using an undivided electrolytic cell with a BDD anode and an O 2-diffusion 16
cathode to electrogenerate continuously H 2O2 from reaction (2). Both EAOPs were tested with 17
metabolite solutions containing a low content of 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 as background electrolyte and 1.0 18
mM Fe2+ as catalyst at pH 3.0, near the optimum pH of 2.8 for Fenton’s reaction (3) [32]. For these 19
methods, organic pollutants are expected to be mainly oxidized by BDD(•OH) and •OH formed 20
from reactions (1) and (3), respectively, alt hough parallel reactions with weaker oxidants such as 21
electrogenerated H 2O2, as well as peroxodisulfate ion [18], ozone [18] and ferrate ion [35] also 22
produced at the BDD anode, are possible in much less extent. Photoelectro-Fenton was performed 23
by irradiating the solution with UVA light. Comparative treatments by anodic oxidation without and 24
with UVA irradiation were also made to assess the higher oxidation power of electro-Fenton and 25
photoelectro-Fenton. The influence of current density and metabolite concentration on the 26PART B  –Results and Discussion -

 Clofibric acid, 4-chlorophenol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid, 9
tartronic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, formic acid and oxalic acid were either reagent or 10
analytical grade from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Panreac and Avocado. 4-Chlorocatechol was 11
synthesized by chlori nation of pyrocatechol with SO 2Cl2 [23]. Anhydrous sodium sulfate and 12
heptahydrated ferrous sulfate were analytical grade from Fluka. Solutions were prepared with high- 13
purity water obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q system (resistivity > 18 M Ω cm at 25 ºC) and their 14
pH was adjusted to 3.0 with analytical grade sulfuric acid from Merck. Other chemicals and organic 15
solvents were either HPLC or analytical grade from Panreac. 16
 The solution pH was determined with a Crison 2000 pH-meter. Aliquots withdrawn from treated 17
solutions were filtered with Whatman 0.45 µm PTFE filters before analysis. The degradation of 18
clofibric acid solutions was monitored from the removal of their total organic carbon (TOC), 19
measured on a Shimadzu VCSN TOC analyzer. Reproducible values were obtained using the 20

 The concen tration  of chloride ion in treated solu tions was d etermined  by ion chromatography 4
with a Shimadzu 10Avp HPLC chromatograph fitted with a Shim-Pack IC-A1S, 100 mm x 4.6 mm 5
(i. d.), anion column at 40 ºC and coupled with a Shimadzu CDD 10Avp conductivity detector. A 6
mixture of 2.5 mM phtalic acid and 2.4 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) of pH 4.0 at 1.5 ml 7

(pH = 2.5)/pentanol mixture at 1.0 ml min-1 as mobile phase. For each product, this detector was 16
selected at the maximum wavelength of its UV-absorption band. Carboxylic acids were identified 17
by ion-exclusion chromatography using the above HPLC chromatograph fitted with a Bio-Rad 18

8characteristics of the O 2-diffusion cat hode have been described elsewhere [23,25]. Experiments 1
were made at a constant current density ( j) of 33, 100 and 150 mA cm-2, supplied by an Amel 2053 2
potentiostat-galvanostat. Electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton treatments were carried out with 3
solutions containing 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 as background electrolyte and 1.0 mM Fe2+ as catalyst of pH 4
3.0 at 35.0 ºC, which were found as optimum conditions for the degradation of other aromatics in 5
the cell used [23,25]. The latter method became operative when the solution was irradiated with 6
UVA light of λmax = 360 nm emitted by a Philips 6-W fluorescent black light blue tube, yielding a 7
photoionization energy input to the solution of 140 µW cm-2, as detected with a NRC 820 laser 8
power meter working at 514 nm. Comparative anodic oxidation treatments without catalyst Fe2+9
were performed in the absence and presence of UVA irradiation at 100 mA cm-2. 10

3.1. Comparative degradation of clofibric acid 15
 Comparative treatments were made for solutions containi ng 179 mg l-1 clofibric acid (equi valent 16
to 100 mg l-1 TOC) of pH 3.0 at 100 mA cm-2. In these trials the solution pH did not practically 17
vary, reaching final values of 2.8-2.9. The change in solution TOC with applied specific charge ( Q, 18
in A h l-1) for anodic oxidation without and with UVA irradiation, electro-Fenton and photoelectro- 19
Fenton is depicted in Fig. 1. As can be seen, total degradation (> 97% TOC removal) is attained in 20
all cases, although the time required for overall mineralization depends on the method tested. Both 21
anodic oxidatio n methods lead to a slow, but similar, TOC decay up to yield total min eralization at 22
Q= 18 A h l-1, i.e., after 6 h  of bo th treatmen ts. This behav ior indicates that all o rganics are 23
destroyed by the oxidant BDD(•OH) formed at the anode surface from reaction (1), without 24
significant photodecomposition by UVA light, at least of final products. Fig. 1 evidences that the 25
degradation rate (the change of TOC with time) is strongly enhanced using both EAOPs due to the 26PART B  –Results and Discussion -

9catalytic action of the Fe3+/Fe2+ system combined with UVA light when the solution is 1
simultaneously irradiated. The significant acceleration of the destruction of organic pollutants in the 2
early stages of the electro-Fenton process can be explained by their quicker reaction with the great 3
amount of •OH formed from Fenton’s reaction (3). For this EAOP, however, the rate in TOC decay 4
gradually falls at longer elect rolysis time, probably due to the formation of complexes of Fe3+ with 5
final carboxylic acids that are hardly oxidized, and the solution is decontaminated after about 6 h of 6
electrolysis, that is, at similar time to that needed for both anodic oxidation treatments. In contrast, 7
TOC is much more rapidly removed by photoelectro-Fenton, where total mineralization is achieved 8
at Q= 12 A h l-1 (4 h). The increase in min eralization rate in photoelectro-Fenton can be related  to: 9
(i) the parallel photodegradation of complexes of Fe3+ with final carboxylic acids and/or (ii) the 10
enhanced generation of •OH due to additional photoreduction of Fe(OH)2+ from reaction (7). 11
 The above comparative study shows that photoelectro-Fenton is the method with highest 12
oxidation power, then being the best EAOP for the treatment of wastewaters containing clofibric 13
acid. Electro-Fenton also yields much faster degradation than anodic oxidation, but its oxidation 14
power drops significantly at the end of electrolysis due to the very sl ow destruction of final 15
products, which is strongly enhanced by UVA light in photoelectro-Fenton. 16
 The influence of current density and clofibric acid concentration on the oxidizing ability of the 17
above electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes was explored. It was found that these 18
experimental parameters showed the same trends in both EAOPs, as expected if they mainly affect 19
the behavior of the electrolytic system. These effects are depicted in Figs. 2a and 2b for electro- 20
Fenton in which they were more clearly observed due to its lower oxidation power. Thus, Fig. 2a 21
shows that when jincreases from 33 to 150 mA cm-2, the specific charge for total decontamination 22
of 179 mg l-1 of clofibric acid rises from 12 to 22 A h l-1, but the time needed for overall 23
mineralization drops from 12 to about 5 h since the degradation rate is strongly enhanced. This 24
latter tendency can be accounted for by the faster destruction of all pollutants due to the greater 25PART B  –Results and Discussion -

10 production of BDD(•OH) from reaction (1) and of •OH from Fenton’s reaction (3) as j increases, 1
because more H 2O2 is generated at the O 2-diffusion cathode from reaction (1) [25] and then, its 2
reaction with Fe2+ becomes faster. However, the increase in Qfor to tal decontamin ation  when  j 3
rises suggests a lower amount of reactive BDD(•OH) and •OH. That means that a higher proportion 4
of bo th oxidants is progressiv ely wasted by their non-o xidizin g reactions sin ce th ey take place in 5
larger extent. These reactions involve, for example, the anodic oxidation of BDD(•OH) to O 2 and 6
reactions (4)-(6) for •OH. Moreover, increasing j can accelerate the formation of weaker oxidants 7
such as peroxodisulfate ion and ozone [18] that also reduces the relative proportion of BDD(•OH) 8
adsorbed at the anode. On the other hand, Fig. 2b shows that at 100 mA cm-2 overall mineralization 9
is achieved with decreasing consumption of 24 A h l-1 (8 h), 21 A h l-1 (7 h), 18 A h l-1 (6 h) and 12 10
A h l-1 (4 h) starting from 557 (close to saturation), 358, 179 and 89 mg l-1 of th e metabolite, 11
respectively, as expected if lower amount of organic matter is destroyed in solution. These results 12
also evidence the removal of more TOC at a given time with rising initial pollutant content. As an 13
example, at 2 h of electrolysis ( Q = 6 A h l-1) the TOC of the above solutions is reduced by 231, 14
150, 70 and 39 mg l-1. Since the same quantity of BDD(•OH) and •OH is expected to be produced 15
from reactions (1) and (3) in these trials carried out at 100 mA cm-2, it can be assumed that their 16
parallel non-oxi dizing reactions occur in less proportion with rising metabolite concentration. This 17
favors the reaction of more amounts of both kinds of hydroxyl radicals with organics, thus raising 18
the degradation rate of the process. All these findings allow establishing that the oxidation power of 19
EAOPs, corresponding to their degradation rate, increases with increasing current density and initial 20
substrate concentration. 21

3.2. Mineralization current efficiency 23
 It is well-known that reaction of chloroaromatics with hydroxyl radical leads to the release of 24
chloride ion [16,23,26]. This point was confirmed for clofibric acid by recording the ion 25
chromatograms of all treated solutions, which only displayed a defined peak at a retention time ( tr) 26PART B  –Results and Discussion -

11 of 2.3 min related to Cl− ion. The formation of ClO 3− and ClO 4− ions was discarded since they were 1
not detected in these chromatograms. The evolution of Cl− concentration during the degradation of 2
179 mg l-1 of metabolite by anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H 2O2 and the two EAOPs at 100 3
mA cm-2 is presented in Fig. 3. As can be seen, this ion is accumulated and completely removed in 4
300-360 min in all cases, after reaching a maximum concentration of about 8 mg l-1 at 180 min of 5
anodic oxidation, 23 mg l-1 at 20 min of electro-Fenton and 19 mg l-1 at 40 min of photoelectro- 6
Fenton, corresponding to 27%, 78% and 64% of the initial chlorine content in solution (29.5 mg l-1). 7
The slow accumulation of Cl− in the former method confirms the slow reaction of chloro-organics 8
with BDD(•OH), whereas its much faster release at the early stages of both EAOPs corroborates the 9
quick destruction of these pollutants with •OH. The gradual destruction of this ion when electrolysis 10
is prolonged can be explained by its slow oxidation to Cl 2 on BDD, as reported by Kraft et al. [16]. 11
 The above findings allow concluding that the mineralization of clofibric acid involves its 12
conversion into  CO 2 and Cl− as primary ion. This reaction can be written as follows: 13
14
   C 10H11ClO 3  +  17 H 2O→  10 CO 2  +  Cl−  +  45 H+  + 44 e−   (9) 15
16
Reaction (9) was then used to calculate the value of ∆(TOC) theor for each treated solution at chosen 17
electrolysis times and from these data, the corresponding efficiency by means of Eq. 8. 18
 Fig. 4a presents the MCE values determined for the trials reported in Fig. 1. An increase in 19
efficiency with increasing the oxidation power of the method can be observed. Thus, the two less 20
potent anodic oxidation processes possess a similar, small and practically constant MCE value of 21
about 7%, suggesting that most organics are mineralized at the same rate by BDD(•OH) along 22
electrolysis without significan t ro le of UVA light. In contrast, th is parameter attains a much higher 23
value for electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton, although the latter procedure with highest 24
oxidation power is the most efficient because of the parallel photodecomposition of some final 25
products. Note that 33% and 35% efficiencies are found after 20 min of these EAOPs, respectively, 26PART B  –Results and Discussion -

12 confirming that organics are more quickly mineralized with •OH than with BDD(•OH ). At l onger 1
time, a dramatic drop in MCE takes place in both cases due to the generation of final products such 2
as complexes of Fe3+ with carboxylic acids that are more difficultly dest royed by both oxidants 3
and/ or UVA light. 4
 Fig. 4b illustrates the effect of current density and clofibric acid concentration reported in Figs. 5
2a and 2b on the efficiency of EAOPs as a function of specific charge. A gradual drop in MCE, at 6
least up to 6 A h l-1, can be observed when jincreases from 33 to 150 mA cm-2. This trend could 7
seem contradictory to the fact that rising j causes the increase in degradation rate due to the 8
production of more amounts of reactive BDD(•OH ) and •OH, as pointed out above. The 9
concomitant loss in efficiency under these conditions can be associated with the larger waste of 10
both oxidants in faster parallel non-oxidizing r eactions giving rise to lower amounts of them with 11
ability to destroy organics and hence, favoring the consumption of more ineffective specific charge. 12
Fig. 4b also evidences a gradual increase in efficiency of EAOPs with rising metabolite 13
concentration, in agreement with the higher degradation rate found in these trials. This confirms the 14
removal of greater amounts of pollutants with BDD(•OH) and •OH, because their competitive non- 15
oxidizing reactions become less significant. 16
17
3.3. Kinetics of clofibric acid decay 18
 The decay of the metabolite in the different electrochemical methods was followed by reversed- 19
phase HPLC chromatography, where it exhibited a well-defined peak at tr = 7.9 min. A previous 20
experiment carried out by adding 20 mM H 2O2 to a 179 mg l-1 clofibric acid sol ution of pH 3.0 21
showed that the content of this compound remained unchanged, indicating that it can not react 22
directly with electrogenerated H 2O2 in the electrolytic systems. 23
 The comparative kinetics of the removal of clofibric acid with generated strong oxidizing agents 24
(mainly BDD(•OH) and/or •OH) was determined from the treatment of 179 mg l-1 metabo lite  25PART B  –Results and Discussion -

13 solutions at 100 mA cm-2. Fig. 5a shows that clofibric acid concentration undergoes a similar fall by 1
anodic oxidation without and with UVA illumination, disappearing in 360 min in both cases, a time 2
similar to that needed for its total mineralization (see Fig. 1). This confirms that this compound is 3
mainly oxidized by BDD(•OH) from reaction (1), without direct photolysis by UVA light. The 4
above concentration decays were well-fitted to a pseudo-first-order equation, as can be seen in the 5
inset panel of Fig. 5a. From this kinetic analysis, an average pseudo-first-order rate constant ( k) of 6
(1.70±0.13)x10-4 s-1 (square regression coefficient ( R2) = 0.992) is found for both anodic oxidation 7
treatments. This behavior suggests that a steady BDD(•OH) con centration  reacts with  the metabo lite  8
along electrolysis. 9
 On the other hand, Fig. 5b evidences a much quicker and similar abatement of the metabolite 10
under comparable electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton treatments, being completely removed in 11
7 min, as expected if it reacts with a much greater amount of oxidant •OH formed from Fenton’s 12
reaction (3). The inset panel of Fig. 5b shows that the kinetic analysis of these data also agrees with 13
a pseudo-first-order reaction, giving the same k-value of 1.35x10-2 s-1 (R2 = 0.993). This allows 14
concluding that •OH is produced in insignificant quantity by r eaction (7) under UVA irradiation. 15
 The effect of current density on the decay kinetics of this compound was further explored for 16
the electro-Fenton treatment. As can be seen in Fig. 5b, increasing k-values of 5.10x10-3 s-1 (R2 = 17
0.991), 1.35x10-2 s-1 (R2 = 0.993) and 2.04x10-2 s-1 (R2 = 0.992) are found for jvalues of 33, 100 18
and 150 mA cm-2, respectively. This trend confirms a higher •OH production in the medium from 19
Fenton’s reaction (3) when j rises, due to the concomitant accumulation of more electrogenerated 20
H2O2 from reaction (2) [25]. 21

14 organic sol ution was dried with Na 2SO 4, filtered and its volume reduced to 2 ml to concentrate the 1
remaining aromatics to be analyzed by GC-MS. The MS spectrum showed peaks related to stable 2
aromatics such as 4-chlorophenol (m/z = 128 (100, M+), 130 (33, (M+2)+)) at tr = 17.0 min, 3
hydroquinone (m/z = 108 (100, M+)) at tr = 21.5 min, 4-chlorocatechol (m/z = 144 (100, M+), 146 4
(33, (M+2)+)) at tr = 18.2 min and p-benzoquinone (m/z = 110 (53, M+)) at tr = 4.1 min. These 5
products were confirmed in the reversed-phase HPLC chromat ograms of electrolyzed solutions, 6
which exhibited well-defined peaks correspondi ng to 4-chlorophenol at tr = 5.0 min, 4- 7
chlorocatecol at tr = 3.1 min and p-benzoquinone at tr = 2.0 min. These peaks were unequivocally 8
identified by comparing their tr-values and UV-Vis spectra, measured on the photodiode detector, 9
with those of pure compounds. However, only traces of hydroquinone were detected by this 10
technique in all cases, as expected if it is very quickly converted into p-benzoquinone by all 11
oxidizing agents. 12
 The evolution of aromatic intermediates during the different treatments of 179 mg l-1 metabo lite  13
solutions at 100 mA cm-2 is presented in Fig. 6. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, 4-chlorophenol is largely 14
produced in all cases and persists long time, up to 360 min, in both anodic oxidation processes, but 15
it is removed very rapidly, for 7-8 min, in electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton. Comparison of 16
results of Figs. 6a and 5 evidences that in each method this primary product disappears at the same 17
time as the initial pollutant. In contrast, Fig. 6b shows that 4-chlorocatechol is accumulated in much 18
smaller extent in the two latter EAOPs, disappearing in 7 min. The same removal time is found for 19
p-benzoquinone in electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton, although it persists for 60 and 360 min 20
in anodic oxidation with and without UVA irradiation, respectively (see Fig. 6c). These findings 21
suggest the parallel quick photolysis of p-benzoquinone by UVA light, which it is not observed in 22
photoelectro-Fenton because it reacts much more quickly with •OH. 23
 From the above results, a general reaction sequence for the initial degradation of clofibric acid is 24
proposed in Fig. 7, where pollutants can react with BDD(•OH) formed at the anode surface from 25PART B  –Results and Discussion -

15 reaction (1) and/or with •OH produced from Fent on’s reaction (3) in the medium. The process is 1
initiated by the breaking of the C(1)-O bond of clofibric acid by both oxidants to yield 4- 2
chlorophenol and 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid as primary products. Further attack of BDD(•OH ) and 3
•OH on the C(4)-position of 4-chlorophenol gives hydroquinone, with loss of Cl− ion , which is then 4
oxidized to p-benzoquinone. Parallel hydroxylation of 4-chlorophenol only by attack of •OH  on it s 5
C(2)-position leads to 4-chlorocatechol. The subsequent oxidation of the latter product, with release 6
of Cl−, and p-benzoquinone (not shown in Fig. 7) can cause the opening of their benzenic ri ngs to 7
yield different carboxylic acids. The formation of such products was confirmed from analysis of 8
degraded solutions by ion-exclusion HPLC chromatography. 9
 Ion-exclusion chromatograms of solutions treated by the two anodic oxidation methods 10
displayed peaks ascribed to small contents of generated carboxylic acids such as 2- 11
hydroxyisobutyric at tr = 12.6 min, tartronic at tr = 7.7 min, maleic at tr = 8.1 min, fumaric at tr = 12
16.1 min, formic at tr = 14.0 min and oxalic at tr = 6.6 mi n. Tartronic, maleic, fumaric and formic 13
acids come from the oxidation of the aryl moiety of aromatics [26,29,31], whereas 2- 14
hydroxyisobutyric acid is expected to be released in the early stages of the degradation process 15
when 4-chlorophenol is formed (see Fig. 7). All these acids, except oxalic acid, were undetected or 16
detected as traces for short time in electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton. Oxalic acid was 17
accumulated in large extent and persisted up to the end of the mineralization in both processes. This 18
ultimate acid formed from the i ndependent oxidation of the precedent longer-chain carboxylic 19
acids, as well as formic acid, are directly converted into CO 2 [17,29,31]. 20
 Fig. 6d presents the time-course of oxalic acid concentration during all treatments. In both 21
anodic oxidation methods this acid is formed and destroyed at similar rate, reaching 5-6 mg l-1 as 22
maximum at 180 min and disappearing in 360 min, just when the initial substrate is completely 23
removed (see Fig. 5a) and the solution is totally decontaminated (see Fig. 1). This confirms the 24
simultaneous destruction of clofibric acid and most of its products with BDD(•OH ) i n t hese 25PART B  –Results and Discussion -

16 processes, in agreement with the constant efficiency found during degradation (see Fig. 4a). In 1
cont rast, oxalic acid reaches high contents of 68 and 59 mg l-1 after 40 min of electro-Fenton and 2
photoelectro-Fenton, respectively, due to the very quick oxidation of precedent organics with •OH 3
formed from Fenton’s reaction (3). Nevertheless, it is completely removed in 240 min by 4
pho toelectro-Fen ton, just when the so lution is totally decontamin ated (see Fig. 1), still remain ing 5
about 6 mg l-1 (less than 1.5 mg l-1 of TOC) in solution after 360 min of electro-Fenton. Since in 6
these EAOPs a large amount of Fe3+ is formed in the medium from reactions (3) and (4), oxalic acid 7
is really expected to be present in the form of Fe3+-oxalato complexes, which can not be oxidized by 8
•OH in the medium [23,29,33]. Our results indicate that these complexes are slowly mineralized in 9
electro-Fenton with a BDD anode and even more quickly photodecomposed by UVA irradiation in 10
photoelectro-Fenton. 11
 According to these considerations, Fig. 8 shows a proposed degradation pathway for oxalic acid 12
under the present experimental conditions. This acid is oxidized to CO 2 with BDD(••••OH) at the 13
anode surface either directly in both anodic oxidation treatments or as Fe3+-oxalato complexes in 14
electro-Fenton. The latter complexes also undergo a parallel quick phot odecarboxylation under the 15
action of UVA light in photoelectro-Fenton, with regeneration of Fe2+ as proposed by Zuo and 16
Hoigné [34]. This photolytic reaction explains the fastest degradation rate and highest efficiency of 17
photoelectro-Fenton. The fact that oxalic acid is still detected after 6 h of electro-Fenton, while it is 18
removed at the same time for anodic oxidation, suggests a slower reaction of BDD(••••OH) with its 19
Fe3+ complexes that causes the decay in oxidation power of this EAOP at long electrolysis time. 20

increases with rising metabolite concentration and with decreasing current density. Comparative 2
treatments by anodic oxidation are much sl ower, confirming the high production of •OH from 3
Fenton’s reaction (3) in the above EAOPs. In all methods Cl− is released and totally oxidized  to Cl 2 4

hydroxylated to yield 4-chl orophenol, which is further oxi dized either to p-benzoquinone via 6
hydroquinone or to 4-chlorocatechol. These products are subsequently degraded to tartronic, maleic 7
and fumaric acids, which are quickly converted into oxalic acid. The latter acid is also obtained 8
from the oxidation of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid, initially generated when 4-chlorophenol is formed. 9
Formic aci d also generated in the degradation path is rapidly converted into CO 2. The ultimate 10
product oxalic acid is then transformed into CO 2 on BDD either directly in anodic oxidation or as 11
Fe3+-oxalato complexes in electro-Fenton. The parallel quick photolysis of these complexes by 12
UVA light in photoelectro-Fenton explains the fastest degradation rate and highest efficiency of this 13
method, which appears to be the best EAOP for the treatment of wastewaters containing clofibric 14
acid. 15

We present in this work a comparative study on oxidizing power and mineralization 
efficiency of four variants of electro-Fenton process which is developed by Brillas's and 
Oturan's team during the last decade. We show that the efficiency of different systems under 
study is determined by the nature of cathode/anode materials used and the catalytic behavi our 
of the Fe
3+/Fe2+ redox couple as catalyst. In this paper we demonstrate that the four electro-
Fenton system studied can be successfully applied to the treatment of an antimicrobial (chlorophene) aqueous sol ution, which is an emergent environmental pollutant. 
We think this manuscript is appropriate for publication in Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 
on account of the growing importance of advanced electrochemical oxidation process 
(AEOPs) in treatment of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This innovative and environmentally friendly technology can have high potential impact on this field due to its 
very high mineralization efficiency. Cover LetterPART B  –Results and Discussion -

2Abstract 22
23
 Solutions of the antimicrobial chlorophene with 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 and Fe3+ as catalyst of 24
pH 3.0 have been comparatively degraded by the elect ro-Fenton method using four undivided 25
electrolytic cells containing a Pt or boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a carbon-felt or 26
O2-diffusion cat hode at constant current. Under these envi ronmentally friendly conditions, 27
pollutants are oxidized with hydroxyl radical (•OH) formed at the anode from water oxidation 28
and in t he medium from Fent on’s reaction between elect rogenerated Fe2+ and H 2O2 at the 29
cathode. The catalytic behavior of the Fe3+/Fe2+ system mainly depends on the cathode tested. 30
In the cells with an O 2-diffusion cathode, H 2O2 is largely accumulated and their Fe3+ content 31
remains practically unchanged, while the chlorophene decay is enhanced when Fe3+32
concentration rises due to the greater •OH production from the higher quantity of Fe2+33
regenerated at the cathode. When a carbon-felt cathode is used, H 2O2 is electrogenerated in 34
small extent with large accumulation of Fe2+, because th is ion is more rapid ly regenerated at 35
the cathode than oxidized to Fe3+ at the Pt or BDD anode, only being required the presence of 36
0.2 mM Fe3+ to obtain the maximum •OH generation with the quickest chlorophene removal. 37
Chlorophene is poorly mineralized in the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell due to the difficult oxidation of 38
final Fe3+-oxalate complexes with  •OH. These species are completely destroyed using a BDD 39
anode at high current due to the great •OH generation on its surface. Total mineralization is 40
also achieved in the Pt/carbon felt and BDD/carbon felt cells with 0.2 mM Fe3+, where oxalic 41
acid and its Fe2+ complexes are directly oxidized with •OH in the medium. The highest 42
oxidizing power for total mineralization at high current is attained for the BDD/carbon felt 43
cell, because oxalic acid can be simultaneously destroyed on BDD. 44

31. Introduction 50
51
 A large variety of advanced oxidation processes (AOP’s) have been recently proposed for 52
the degradation of toxic and biorefractory organics in wastewaters [1-3]. They are chemical, 53
photochemical, photocatalytic and electrochemical procedures characterized by the in situ 54
generation of hydroxyl radical (••••OH) as the main oxi dizing agent of pollutants. This radical 55
has a high standard potential ( Eº(••••OH/H 2O) = 2.80 V vs. NHE) and it is the second most 56
strong oxidizing species known, after fluorine. ••••OH has enough ability to r eact non- 57
selectively with organics yielding dehydrogenated or hydroxylated deri vatives up to their 58
final min eraliza tion, i.e., their to tal conversion into CO 2, water and inorganic ions. One of the 59
most popular AOP’s for the treatment of acidic waters is the Fenton’s reagent [2-4], 60
composed of a mixture of Fe2+ and hydrogen peroxide that is added to the contami nated water 61
to produce ••••OH and Fe3+ according to the classical Fenton’s reaction (1) with a second-order 62
rate constant ( k) of 63 M-1 s-1 [4]: 63
64
   F e2+  +  H 2O2   →  Fe3+  +  •OH  +  OH−    (1) 65
66
This method becomes effective because reactions between •OH and organics are usually very 67
fast, with k-values of 108-1010 M-1 s-1. However, a part of the generated radical is lost due to 68
its direct reaction with Fe2+ (k = 3.2x108 M-1 s-1 [5]) and H 2O2 (k = 2.7 x107 M-1 s-1 [6]), as 69
shown in reaction (2) and reaction (3), respectively: 70
71
   F e2+  +  •OH  →  Fe3+  +  OH−     (2) 72
   H 2O2  +  •OH  → HO 2•  +  H 2O     (3) 73
74
An advantage of the use of the Fe3+/Fe2+ system is its catalytic behavior, since Fe2+ is not 75
completely removed by reactions (1) and (2) because it can be regenerated in small extent 76
from t he reduction of Fe3+ by H 2O2 from reaction (4) with k = 8.4 x 10-6 M-1 s-1 [7], by 77
hydroperoxyl radical (HO 2•) from reaction (5) with k = 2 x 103 M-1 s-1 [8] and/or by organic 78PART B  –Results and Discussion -

4radical intermediates R• from reaction (6). HO 2• is an oxidant much weaker than •OH and can 79
also oxidize Fe2+ from reaction (7) with k = 1.2x106 M-1 s-1 [8]. 80

   F e2+  +  HO 2•→  Fe3+  +  HO 2−     (7) 85
86
Reactions (4)-(6) propagate Fent on’s reaction (1) with the continuous production of •OH for 87
the destruction of organic pollutants. 88
 Electro-oxidation methods such as anodic oxidation and electro-Fenton are also being 89
developed for water remediation [9-45]. These environmentally friendly electrochemical 90
techniques are more potent than chemical AOP’s because they can produce greater amount of 91
oxidant •OH under control of the applied current. In anodic oxidation contaminants are 92
destroyed by reaction with adsorbed hydroxyl radical generated at the surface of a high O 2- 93
overvoltage anode from water oxidation [9-12], according to reaction (8): 94
95
 H 2O→ƔOH ads  +  H+  +  e−   (8) 96
97
Conventional anodes such as Pt, PbO 2, IrO 2, etc., lead to poor degradation of aromatics due to 98
the formation of carboxylic acids that are difficultly oxidizable by ƔOH. These products can 99

greater O 2-overvoltage and produces higher amount of effective ƔOH from reaction (8) than 101
the above anodes, t hus leading t o a quicker oxidation of organics [12]. Recent studies have 102
confirmed the total mineralization of several aromatics and short carboxylic acids in waters 103
by anodic oxidation with a BDD anode [9-22]. 104
 Electro-Fenton is an indirect electro-oxidation treatment based on the combined use of 105
cathodically generated hydrogen peroxide and iron ions as catalyst [23-45]. The method 106
consists in the continuous supply of H 2O2 to the acidic contaminated solution from the two- 107

Reaction (9) can take place at reticulated vitreous carbon [23,24,26,27,44], carbon-felt [28- 112

generate the o xidizin g agen t •OH from Fenton’s reaction (1). 115
 In our laboratories we have previously studied the electro-Fenton degradation of some 116
aromatic compounds, mainly pesticides, such as chlorophenoxy acids [17,28-31,32,39] and 117
organophosphorus [34], dyes [37], industrial pollutants [33,38,40,45] and analgesic 118
pharmaceuticals as emerging pollutants [42] using different undivided electrolytic cells. The 119
outstanding oxidizing power of these electro-Fenton systems has been explained by the fast 120
reaction of organics with •OH formed in the medium from reaction (1) and in some cases, at 121
the anode from reaction (8), being the former reaction enhanced by the additional 122
regeneration of Fe2+ from cathodic reduction of Fe3+: 123

of the Fe3+/Fe2+ catalytic system involved in the electrolytic cell such as: (i) the actual 128
reduction ability of the cat hode to regenerate Fe2+ from reaction (10), (ii) the o xid ation  ability 129
of the anode to convert Fe2+ into Fe3+ from reaction (11), (iii) the action of weak oxidants 130

6wastewaters containing aromatics. To clarify them, we have undertaken a comparative study 139
on the behavior of the Fe3+/Fe2+ system using four undivided electrolytic cells containing a Pt 140
or BDD anode and a carbon-felt or O 2-diffusion cathode. The comparative oxidizing power of 141
these cells was tested from the degradation of chlorophene ( o-benzyl- p-chlorophenol, see 142
chemical structure in Fig. 1). Pharmaceuticals belonging to several therapeutical classes are 143
being continuously detected in the environment, but their effects on humans and aquatic fauna 144
are not well known for the moment. Chlorophene was chosen since it is a widespread broad- 145
spectrum antimicrobial pharmaceutical, commonly used in hospitals and households for 146
general cleaning and disinfecting, as well as in industrial and farming environments as an 147
active agent in disinfectant formulations [46-48]. It has been detected at concentrations up to 148
50 mg l-1 in activated sludge sewage systems and up to 10 µg l-1 in sewage treatment plant 149
effluents and rivers. Although chlorophene is expected to pose a low toxicity for humans, 150
evidence of its carcinogenic and mutagenic activity in animals is documented [49]. To avoid 151
its dangerous accumulation in soils and the aquatic environment, this comp ound and its by- 152
products need to be removed from wastewaters by potent and viable oxidation methods. In 153
this sense, only its oxidative degradation with MnO 2 has been described [46]. 154
 This paper reports a detailed investigation on t he catalytic behavior of the Fe3+/Fe2+155
system in the electro-Fenton degradation of chlorophene using undivided Pt/O 2 diffusion, 156
BDD/O 2 diffu sion, Pt/carbon felt and BDD/carbon felt cells. Co mparative experiments were 157
carried out with solutions containing 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 as background electrolyte and Fe3+ at pH 158
3.0, near the optimum pH of 2.8 for Fent on’s reaction (1) [5]. The evolution of Fe2+, Fe3+ and 159
H2O2 in each cell was examined in the absence of pollutants to know the extent of reactions 160
(10) and (11). Concentrated solutions of chlorophene (solubility in water 145 mg l-1) were 161
degraded to clarify better the effects of the Fe3+/Fe2+ system. In each electro-Fenton system 162
the influence of Fe3+ content and applied current on its degradation rate and oxidizing power 163
for total mineralization was also explored. The kinetics of chlorophene decay and the 164
evolution of its generated carboxylic acids were followed by chromatographic techni ques. 165

2.1. Chemicals 172
 Chlorophene was reagent grade from Sigma-Aldrich, being used in the electrolytic 173
experiments as received. Benzoic, maleic, fumaric, malonic, glycolic, glyoxylic, formic and 174
oxalic acids were either reagent or analytical grade supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka and 175
Acros Organics. Sulfuric acid, anhydrous sodium sulfate, heptahydrated ferrous sulfate and 176
ferric sulfate were analytical grade purchased from Fluka and Acros Organics. All solutions 177
were prepared with ultra-pure water obtained from a Millipore Milli–Q system with resistivity 178
> 18 MΩ cm at room temperature. Organic solvents and the other chemicals used were either 179
HPLC or analytical grade from Fluka, Panreac and Acros Organics. 180

2.2. Instruments 182
 Electrolyses were performed either with a Hameg HM8040 triple power supply or a 183
Micronics-Systems MX 30 V-10 A microlab power supply. The solution pH was measured 184
with a Eutech Instruments CyberScan pH1500 pH-meter. The mineralization of chlorophene 185
solutions was monitored by the abatement of their total organic carbon (TOC), determined on 186
a Shimadzu VCSH TOC analyzer. The decays of chlorophene and benzoic acid were followed 187
by reversed-phase HPLC chromatography usi ng a Merck Lachrom liquid chromatograph 188
equipped with a L-7100 pump, fitted with a Purospher RP-18 5 µm, 25 cm x 4.6 mm, column 189

a SRS-ULTRA II self-regenerating suppressor. Colorimetric measurements were made with a 202
Unicam UV4 Prisma double-beam spectrometer thermostated at 25.0 ºC. 203
 Oxidation products were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 204
using a Hewlett-Packard system composed of a HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph fitted 205
either with a HP-5 0.25 µm or a HP-Innowax 0.25 µm, both of 30 m x 0.25 mm, column and 206
coupled with a HP 5989A mass spectrometer operating in EI mode at 70 eV. The temperature 207
ramp for the HP-5 column was 35 ºC for 2 min, 10 ºC min-1 up to 320 ºC and hold time 5 min, 208
and the temperatures of the inlet, transfer line and detector were 250 ºC, 250 ºC and 290 ºC, 209
respectively. The temperature ramp for the HP-Innowax column was 35 ºC for 2 min, 10 ºC 210

2.3. Electrolytic systems 214
 All electrolyses were conducted in an undivided glass cell of 6 cm diameter and 250 ml 215
capacity. Four different electro-Fenton systems were tested: (i) a Pt/O 2 diffusi on cell, with a 3 216
cm2 Pt sheet from SEMP as anode and a 3 cm2 carbon-PTFE O 2-diffusion  electrode from E- 217
TEK as cathode, (ii) a BDD/O 2 diffusion cell, containing a 3 cm2 BDD thin-film deposited on 218
conductive single crystal p-type Si (100) wafers from CSEM as anode and the above O 2- 219
diffusion cathode, (iii) a Pt/carbon felt cell, with a 4.5 cm2 Pt cylindrical mesh as anode and a 220
70 cm2 (17 cm x 4,1 cm) carbon felt from Carbone-Lorraine as cathode and (iv) a 221
BDD/carbon felt cell, containing the above BDD anode and carbon-felt cathode. The 222
preparation of the O 2-diffusion cathode has been reported elsewhere [25,31]. In the Pt/O 2 223
diffusion and BDD/O 2 diffusion cells, the interelectrode gap was about 1 cm and the cat hode 224
was directly fed with pure O 2 at 20 ml min-1 to generate continuously H 2O2 from reaction (9). 225
In the Pt/carbon felt and BDD/carbon felt cells, the corresponding anode was centered in them 226
and each cathode covered their inner wall, where H 2O2 was produced from reduction of O 2 227
dissolved in the solution, also from reaction (9). Continuous saturation of this gas at 228
atmospheric pressure was ensured by bubbling compressed air at 1 l min-1, starting 15 min 229
before electrolysis. 230PART B  –Results and Discussion -

9 Solutions of 200 ml containing up to 84 mg l-1 chlorophene with 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 and 231
different concentrations of Fe3+ at pH 3.0 adjusted with H 2SO 4 were comparatively degraded 232
in the above four electro-Fenton systems at constant current between 60 and 300 mA and at 233
room temperature (20±1 ºC). All solutions were vigorously stirred with a magnetic bar during 234
treatment. 235
236
2.4. Analytical procedures 237
 Reproducible TOC values were always obtained by injecting 100 µl ali quots into the 238
TOC analyzer using the non-purgeable organic carbon method. The mineralization current 239
efficiency (MCE) for treated solutions at a given time was then calculated from the following 240
equation: 241
242
 MCE  =                        x 100   (12) 243
244
where ∆(TOC) exp is the experimental TOC removal and ∆(TOC) theor is the theoretically 245
calculated TOC decay at a given time considering that the applied electrical charge (= current 246
x time) is only consumed in the mineralization process of chlorophene. 247
 Reversed-phase chromatography analyses were carried out was made under circulation of 248
a 50:50 (v/v) acetonitrile/water mixture at 0.8 ml min-1 as mobile phase. For ion-exclusion 249
chromatography, the mobile phase was 4 mM H 2SO 4 at 0.2 ml min-1. Cl− measurements were 250
conducted with a solution of 1.8 mM Na 2CO 3 and 1.7 mM NaHCO 3 circulating at  1.0 ml 251
min-1 as mobile phase. The concentration of H 2O2 in electrolyzed  so lutions was determined 252
from t he light absorption of the titanic-hydrogen peroxide colored complex at λ = 408 nm 253
[50]. The Fe2+ and Fe3+ contents in the same solutions were obtained by measuring the light 254
absorption of their corresponding colored complexes with 1,10-phenantroline at λ = 508 nm 255
[51] and with SCN− at λ = 466 nm [52], respectively. 256
 To detect the aromatic intermediates, 50 mg l-1 of chlorophene were degraded in the Pt/O 2 257
diffusion cell at low current for 30 min. The remaining organics were withdrawn with 45 ml 258
of CH 2Cl2 in three times. This solutio n was then dried  with  anhydrous Na 2SO 4, filtered and its 259
volume reduced to 2 ml to concentrate the aromatics for their analysis by GC-MS using the 260∆(TOC) exp

3.1. Behavior of the Fe3+/Fe2+ system without pollutants 269
 A preliminary study was carried out to test the oxidation ability of t he Pt and BDD 270
anodes to transform Fe2+ into Fe3+ via reaction (11). Several electrolyses of 200 ml of a 0.05 271
M Na 2SO 4 solution with 4.0 mM Fe2+ at pH 3.0 and at 300 mA were made usi ng undivided 272
cells containing one of the above anodes and a 3 cm2 stainless steel (AISI 304) sheet as 273
cathode. A quick decay of Fe2+ concentration, along with the simultaneous increase in Fe3+274
content, was found in both cases, indicating a very poor regeneration of Fe2+ at the stainless 275
steel cathode from reaction (10) compared to its fast oxidation at each anode from reaction 276
(11). Fe2+ was completely removed in 45 min using BDD (current efficiency 95%), whereas 277
for Pt, a longer time of 64 min was required (current efficiency 67%). Kinetic analysis of 278
these data showed a pseudo-first-order decay for Fe2+ during the initial 20-30 min of both 279
electrolyses, with a pseudo-rate constant ( k1) of 9.05x10-4 s-1 (square linear regression 280
coefficient R2 = 0.995) for BDD and 5.87x10-4 s-1 (R2 = 0.991) for Pt. The faster Fe2+ removal 281
with BDD can be accounted for by its greater O 2-overpotential [12] that favors reaction (11) 282
instead of O 2 evolution from water oxidation, a process taki ng place in larger extent in Pt. The 283
greater O 2-overpotential of BDD causes an average cell voltage equal to 9.8 V, a value much 284
higher than 5.7 V when it is replaced by Pt. 285
 Several experiments were further performed to clarify the evolution of Fe3+, Fe2+ and 286
accumulated H 2O2 in the four electro-Fenton systems with H 2O2 electrogeneration considered 287
in the present work. The time-course of these species during the electrolysis of 200 ml of a 288
0.05 M Na 2SO 4 solution with 4.0 mM Fe3+ at pH 3.0 and at 300 mA for 60 min using the 289
Pt/O 2 diffusion and BDD/O 2 diffusi on cells, is depicted in Fig. 2a. As can be seen, the Fe3+290
concentration remains practically unchanged in both trials. In addition, no signi ficant quantity 291PART B  –Results and Discussion -

11of Fe2+ was detected in the electrolyzed solutions, as expected if reaction (10) occurs in such a 292
small extent at the O 2-diffusion cathode that the generated Fe2+ is rapidly converted i nto Fe3+293
from reactions (1), (2) and (7) and mainly at the anode from reaction (11), thus preventing its 294
accumulation in the medium. The predominant reaction in this cathode is the reduction of 295
injected O 2 to electrogenerate H 2O2 from reaction (9). This can be easily deduced from Fig. 2a 296
because this species is continuously accumulated up to reach a steady concentration of about 297
9 mM after 45 min in both electrolyses, just when its electrogeneration and decomposition 298
rates become equal. Under these conditions, H 2O2 can be slowly decomposed with Fe2+ by 299
reaction (1) and with Fe3+ by reaction (4), but it is much more rapidly oxidized to O 2 via 300
formation of HO 2• as intermediate at the anode surface [31,39]: 301
302
 H 2O2→  HO 2•   +  H+  +  e−   (13) 303
 HO 2•→  O 2  +  H+  +  e−   (14) 304
305
Our results indicate that the rates of reactions (13) and (14) are practically independent of the 306
anode used, despite the average cell voltage raises from 12.0 V for the Pt/O 2 diffusion  cell to 307
19.0 V for the BDD/O 2 diffusion one. 308
 A very different behavior of these species was found using the Pt/carbon felt and 309
BDD/carbon felt cells. These trials were also performed at 300 mA, but with a smaller content 310
of Fe3+ (0.20 mM ) in the 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 solution of pH 3.0 to try to clarify better the extent 311
of reactions (10) and (11). As can be seen in Fig. 2b, the use of the Pt/carbon felt cell gives 312
rise to the reduction of all Fe3+ to  Fe2+ in 20 min, indicating that reaction (10) is very fast at 313
the carbon felt cathode. Its kinetic analysis allows determining a k1-value of 4.05x10-3 s-1 for 314
overall Fe2+ regeneration, corresponding to a reaction rate of 8.1 0x10-7 M s-1 for 0.20 mM 315
Fe2+. This value is much higher than 1.17x10-7 M s-1 expected from its oxidation at the Pt 316
anode from reaction (11) with k1 = 5.87x10-4 s-1, as determined above. The parallel generation 317
of H 2O2 from reaction (9) in the carbon-felt cathode is rather slow, being detected at a 318
concentration as low as 0.23 mM after 60 min of electrolysis in the Pt/carbon felt cell (not 319
shown in Fig. 2b). This confirms the consumption of Fe2+ by reactions (1), (2) and (7) in 320
parallel to reaction (11), although its regeneration from reaction (10) is so fast that only Fe2+321PART B  –Results and Discussion -

12is detected for electrolysis times longer than 20 mi n. In contrast, Figure 2b shows that Fe3+ is 322
no t to tally conv erted  into Fe2+ in the BDD/carbon felt cell under comparable conditions. The 323
Fe2+ content in th is cell immediately rises up to  0.058 mM in 2 min  and thereafter, it is slowly 324
removed to disappear in 60 min, when 0.20 mM of H 2O2 is accumulated. This anomalous 325
trend can be explained by the additional destruction of Fe2+ with weak oxidant species 326
produced at the BDD anode, since its great O 2-overpotential causes an average voltage 327
applied to the BDD/carbon felt cell at 300 mA equal to 12.5 V, a value much higher than 2.2 328
V using a Pt anode. Under these conditions, it is well-known that peroxodisulfate is 329
competitively formed with •OH at the BDD anode from the reaction (15) [12,14]: 330
331
   2  H S O 4−→  S2O82−  +  2 H+  +  2 e−     ( 1 5 )  332
333
and this ion can further react with Fe2+ to yield sulfate and Fe3+ from reaction (16), with  k = 334
23 M-1 s-1 [53]: 335
336
   S 2O82−  +  2 Fe2+→  2 SO 42−  +  2 Fe3+    ( 1 6 )  337
338
The slow disappearance of Fe2+ generated from reaction (10) in the BDD/carbon felt cell can 339
then be accounted for by the increase in rate of reaction (16) due to the continuous 340
accumulation of S 2O82− in the medium. However, Fe3+ does not seem to be co mpletely 341
regenerated in this cell, since its concent ration undergoes a progressive abatement with 342
electrolysis time (see Fig. 2b). An inspection of the carbon felt cathode after this trial revealed 343
the presence of a yellow precipitate of Fe(OH) 3 on its large and porous surface (geometric 344
area 70 cm2). The decay in Fe3+ con tent can  be related to the gradual formation of such 345
precipitate due to th e high OH− concentration present in t he vicinity of the cathode coming 346
from the simultaneous water reduction to hydrogen. Note that no precipitation of Fe(OH) 3 347
was observed neither in the systems containing an O 2-diffusion cathode with much smaller 348
geometric surface (3 cm2), nor in the Pt/carbon felt cell where Fe3+ is co mp letely reduced to 349
Fe2+ at the cathode. 350PART B  –Results and Discussion -

on the cathode used. The fast generation of H 2O2 from reaction (9) at the O 2-diffusion cathode 352
favors the accumulation of large amounts of this species in the Pt/O 2 diffusion and BDD/O 2 353
diffusion cells. The regenerated Fe2+ by reaction (10) is then rapidly oxidized to Fe3+ by 354
reactions (1), (2), (7) and (11), so Fe3+ concentration does not practically varies along 355
electrolysis. In contrast, the carbon felt cathode yields a much smaller quantity of H 2O2, but 356
reaction (10) becomes so fast on its surface that Fe2+ is accumulated in large extent in the 357
Pt/carbon felt cell. Under these conditions, a maximum production of •OH from Fenton’s 358
reaction (1) is expected. For the BDD/carbon felt cell, however, regenerated Fe2+ is slowly 359
removed by the weak oxidant peroxodisulfate formed at the BDD anode. This causes two 360
negative effects: (i) a decay in rate of reaction (1) due to the accumulation of a lower quantity 361
of Fe2+ and (ii) the enhancement of Fe(OH) 3 precipitation on the large surface of the carbon 362
felt cathode with loss of soluble Fe3+. To confirm the catalytic behavior of the Fe3+/Fe2+363
system in these four systems, their comparative oxidizing power under electro-Fenton 364
conditions was eval uated by studying the degradation of chlorophene. 365
366
3.2. Chlorophene decay under electro-Fenton conditions 367
 A series of electrolysis was carried out with 50 mg l-1 chlorophene solutions of pH 3.0 at 368
300 mA to determine the influence of Fe3+ concentration on its destruction rate in the Pt/O 2 369
diffusion cell. The kinetics for the reaction of the antimicrobial with generated oxidants was 370
followed by reversed-phase HPLC chromatography, where it exhibits a well-defined peak 371
with a retention  time ( tr) of 16.5 min. The change of its concentration with time for an initial 372
Fe3+ content between 0.2 and 8.0 mM is depicted in Fig. 3. A fast and complete removal of 373
chl orophene can be observed in all cases. Its decay rate undergoes a gradual acceleration 374
when Fe3+ concentration increases, disappearing from the medium in 20 min for 0.2 mM Fe3+, 375
but in only 3 min for 8.0 mM Fe3+. This effect can be related to an increasing quantity of Fe2+376
regenerated from reaction (10) t hat enhances the production of strong oxidant •OH  by 377
Fenton’s reaction  (1) and  hence, its reaction with chlorophen e. Howev er, in this system this 378
compound could also react with •OH produced at the anode surface from reaction (8) and 379
other weaker oxidizing agents such as H 2O2 and HO 2•. Note that greater amounts of HO 2• are 380PART B  –Results and Discussion -

14formed from Fenton-like reaction (4) when Fe3+ conten t rises, alth ough  this species is also 381
generated from H 2O2 oxidation by reaction (13). The possible action of H 2O2 as oxidant was 382
discarded by confirming that the antimicrobial concentration does not vary in 200 ml of a 383
solution of pH 3.0 prepared with 50 mg l-1 of chlorophene and 20 mM H 2O2. To clarify the 384
influence of •OH  and H O 2• produced at the Pt anode, a 50 mg l-1 chlorophene solution of pH 385
3.0 was electrolyzed in the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell, but without Fe3+, i.e., using anodic oxidation 386
in the presence of electrogenerated H 2O2. Figure 4 shows that this method yields a much 387
slower removal of this compound, disappearing in 300 min, a time much longer than that 388
needed in the presence of Fe3+ (see Fig. 3). Since in anodic oxidation organics are oxidized by 389
•OH formed from reaction (8) and in smaller extent by HO 2• largely produced from reaction 390
(13) [39], one can infer that the much faster destruction of the antimicrobial under the electro- 391
Fenton conditions shown in Fig. 3 is due to its reaction with •OH formed from Fenton’s 392
reaction (1), which is enhanced with raising Fe2+ regeneration when more Fe3+ is presen t in 393
the solution. 394
 A similar influence of Fe3+ concent ration on chl orophene destruction was observed by 395
electrolyzing 50 mg l-1 antimicrobial solutions of pH 3.0 at 300 mA in the BDD/O 2 diffusion 396
cell when the Fe3+ content increased from 0.2 to 8.0 mM. However, its decay rate was 397
significantly reduced in comparison to that found for the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell. Figure 4 398
illustrates that the time required for overall removal of chlorophene increases from 7 min for 399
the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell to 90 min for t he BDD/O 2 diffusion one using 4.0 mM Fe3+. This trend 400
seems surprising at first sight, since an acceleration of the destruction of this compound using 401
BDD could be expected due to its much greater oxidizing power [12], as was corroborated by 402
treating comparatively the antimicrobial solution by anodic oxidation in the presence of 403
electrogenerated H 2O2 either with a BDD or Pt anode. As can be seen in Fig. 4, anodic 404
oxidation with BDD gives faster chlorophene decay, in agreement with the pr oduction of 405
more reactive •OH from reaction (8). The opposite effect found under electro-Fenton 406
conditions can then be accounted for by the quicker oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ at the BDD 407
anode than at the Pt one from reaction (11), along with its additional destruction by reaction 408
(16) with S 2O82− generated at the former anode. This causes a drop in the regeneration rate of 409
Fe2+ from reaction (10) and consequently, in •OH produced from Fenton’s reaction (1), 410PART B  –Results and Discussion -

15reducing its reaction rate with chlorophene. These results also evidence that this compound is 411
not significantly oxidized by S 2O82−. 412
 When a carbon-felt cathode was used in the electrolytic cell, a more positive action of the 413
Fe3+/Fe2+ system was found due to the much faster regeneration of Fe2+ at its surface (see Fig. 414
2b) leading to  much greater •OH production. Figure 5a shows the chlorophene abatement for 415
50 mg l-1 of t he antimicrobial solutions of pH 3.0 with Fe3+ contents between 0.1 and 2.0 mM 416
treated in the Pt/carbon felt cell at 60 mA. The quickest antimicrobial decay in this system is 417
achieved either with 0.1 or 0.2 mM Fe3+, disappearing in 20 min in both cases, since its 418
removal rate undergoes a gradual drop at higher Fe3+ concentration up to needing a time as 419
long as 60 min for its destruction with 2.0 mM Fe3+. This tendency can be associated with a 420
progressive fall of •OH content in solution, mainly due to the participation of non-oxidizing 421
reaction (2), which is strongly accelerated when much larger amounts of Fe2+ are formed from 422
reaction (10) as more Fe3+ is added to the starting solution. That means that the maximum 423
concentration of reactive •OH in the Pt/carbon felt cell at 60 mA is attained using 0.1-0.2 mM 424
Fe3+, that is, when this radical formed from Fenton’s reaction (1) is wasted i n smaller extent 425
with regenerated Fe2+. This effect was also found by applying higher currents. As an example, 426
Figure 5b presents the chlorophene removal in the same conditions as in Fig. 5a, but at 300 427
mA. By comparing both figures one can easily deduce that the destruction of this compound 428
is enhanced with raising current, because more amount of oxidant •OH is produced due to the 429
quicker H 2O2 formation and Fe2+ regeneration at the cathode. At 300 mA, however, the 430
antimicrobial disappears in 5 min using 0.2 mM Fe3+, whereas it undergoes a slower removal 431
for the other Fe3+ contents. These findings allow concluding that a small concentration equal 432
to 0.2 mM of Fe3+ in the starting solution is optimal for this electro-Fenton system. Note that 433
an increase in current also causes the production of more •OH at the Pt anode surface from 434
reaction (8) [20,39,42]. However, the reaction of this species with chlorophene on Pt is 435
insignificant in comparison to that of •OH formed from Fenton’s reaction (1), as deduced 436
from Fig. 4. Similar results were obtained by electrolyzing the same solutions with the 437
BDD/carbon felt cell, although the antimicrobial was more slowly removed under comparable 438
conditions, as expected from the negative effect of reaction (16) on Fe2+ regeneration, as 439
discussed in section 3.1. 440PART B  –Results and Discussion -

16 Kinetic analysis of the above chlorophene concentration decays only fit to a pseudo-first- 441
order equation for the cells containing a carbon-felt cathode, where this compound and •OH 442
react very rapi dly in solution. The second-order rate constant or absolute rate constant for the 443
aforementioned reaction was then determined using these electro-Fenton systems from the 444
proposed method of competitive kinetics [40], taking benzoic acid as standard competition 445
substrate. Following this method, the pseudo-first-order rate constants for chlorophene ( k1,C P) 446
and benzoic acid ( k1,BA) were simultaneously obtained in such systems for short electrolysis 447
times, then calculating the second-order rate constant for chlorophene ( kCP) from that of 448
benzoic acid ( kBA = 4.30x109 M-1 s-1 [55]) as follows: 449
450
    kCP   =               x  kBA       ( 1 7 )  451

Figure 6 shows the excellent linear correlations found for the pseudo-fist-order kinetic 453
analysis of the decay of both com pounds followed by reversed-phase HPLC chromatography 454
(tr,CP = 15.4 min, tr,BA = 3.4 min) during the electrolysis of 50 mg l-1 of chl orophene and 122 455
mg l-1 of benzoic acid with 0.2 mM Fe3+ in the Pt/carbon felt and BDD/carbon felt cells at 60 456
mA. From these plots, values of k1,CP = 1.15x 10-3 s-1 (R2 = 0.997) and k1,BA = 4.82x10-4 s-1 (R2457
= 0.995) for the first cell and k1,CP = 1.03x 10-3 s-1 (R2 = 0.996) and k1,BA = 4.47x10-4 s-1 (R2 = 458
0.997) for the second one were determined. Taking these data in Eq. 16, one obtains an 459
average value for kCP of (1.00±0.01)x1010 M-1 s-1, close to 7.1x109 M-1 s-1 reported by Arnold 460
et al. for chlorophene degradation with Fenton’s reagent [47]. This kCP-value allows 461
calculating a steady •OH concentration in solution of about 10-13 M at 60 mA. 462

represents the degradation rate of all pollutants. This study was carried out with solutions of 467

17solution pH slightly decreased during electrolysis due to the formation of acidic products, up 470
to a final value of 2.7-2.8. 471
 Figure 7a shows selected TOC-time plots for the degradation of the above chlorophene 472
solution with 4.0 mM Fe3+ using an O 2-diffusion cathode. A continuous, but slow, TOC 473
abatement can be observed in the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell, only attaining 52% of mineralization 474
after 660 min of electrolysis at 300 mA. This poor decontamination can be related to the 475
formation of products, as short carboxylic acids and their complexes with iron ions, that are 476
difficultly oxidizable with ƔOH produced in the medium from Fenton’s reaction (1) and at the 477
Pt anode surface from reaction (8) [31,32,39,42]. In contrast, these species can be completely 478
removed in the BDD/O 2 diffusion cell at 300 mA (see Fig. 7a), indicating that they are 479
oxidized by ƔOH on BDD. This agrees with the greater oxidation ability of this anode than 480
that of Pt [12]. As can be seen in Fig. 7a, the degradation rate of the chlorophene solution in 481
the BDD/O 2 diffusion cell rapidly increases with raising current from 60 to 300 mA, as 482
expected from the concomitant production of more amount of ƔOH on the anode. After 11 h 483
of treatment, its TOC is reduced by 33%, 45%, 85% and 97% at 60, 100, 200 and 300 mA, 484
resp ectively. This electro-Fenton system then yields a rap id  and  to tal mineralization  by 485
applying high currents, when BDD has great oxidizing power. 486
 A much faster degradation of the antimicrobial solution was found using the Pt/carbon 487
felt cell. Figure 7b illustrates that this system is able to decontaminate completely the solution 488
with an optimum concentration 0.2 mM of Fe3+ for all currents between 60 and 300 mA. An 489
enhancement of the degradation rate with raising current can be observed, mainly for the first 490
60 min when aromatic intermediates are expected to be more easily destroyed. In all cases and 491
after 540 min of treatment, more t han 95% of mineralization is achieved. The great oxidizing 492
power of this system can be ascribed to the rapid oxidation of all products (aromatics and 493
carboxylic acids) with the high amounts of ƔOH formed from Fenton’s reaction (1) due to the 494
fast regeneration of Fe2+ at the carbon-felt cathode by reaction (10), without significant 495
particip ation  of ƔOH generated at the Pt anode. Figure 7b also shows that the BDD/carbon felt 496
cell has even higher oxidizing power to decontaminate completely the same solution in a 497
shorter time of 6 h at 300 mA, although TOC is more hardly reduced for the first 2 h and 498
further, much more rapidly removed. The different degradation rate of the BDD/carbon felt 499PART B  –Results and Discussion -

18cell compared to that of the Pt/carbon felt one can be accounted for: (i) the slower oxidation 500
rate of chlorophene and its aromatics products in the medium due to the lower production of 501
ƔOH, since Fe2+ is accu mu lated in mu ch less exten t by its reaction with S 2O82− generated at 502
the BDD anode, and (ii) the parallel quicker destruction of all pollutants with ƔOH at the BDD 503
anode, enhancing the mineralization of more persistent products such as final carboxylic 504
acids. The much quicker TOC abatement in the BDD/carbon felt cell than in the BDD/O 2 505
diffusion one at 300 mA (see Figs. 7a and 7b) corroborates the oxidation path via ƔOH in the 506
medium. 507
 The mineralization of chl orophene is expected to be accompanied by the loss of its 508
chlorine atom in the form of inorganic ions. This was confirmed by treating 84 mg l-1509
antimicrobial solutions with 0.015 M Na 2SO 4 and 0.2 mM Fe3+ of pH 3.0 in the four cells at 510
150 mA. Ion chromatograms of all electrolyzed solutions only displayed one peak related to 511
chl oride ion, discarding the formation of other ions such as chl orate and perchlorate. As can 512
be seen in Fig. 8, Cl− is rapidly accumulated for 120 min in the cells with a Pt anode and at 513
longer time, it reaches a quasi-steady concentration of about 13 mg l-1, a value very close to 514
13.6 mg l-1 corresponding to the initial chlorine contained in solution. This evidences that all 515
chloro-organics are destroyed with the release of stable chloride ion. A very different 516
behavior can be observed in Fig. 8 for the evolution of Cl− in the cells with a BDD anode, 517
where this ion reaches a maximum content between 5 and 9 mg l-1 at 180 min, further being 518
slowly destroyed until disappearing at 540 min. The instability of Cl− under these conditions 519
is due to its oxid ation  to Cl 2 gas on BDD, as reported for t he electrolysis of NaCl aqueous 520
solu tions with  this anode [10]. 521
 The above results allow establishing that the mineralization of chlorophene by electro- 522
Fenton involves its conversion into CO 2 and chloride ion as primary inorganic ion. Its overall 523
reaction can be written as follows: 524
525
 C 13H11ClO  +  25 H 2Oĺ  13 CO 2  +  Cl−  +  61 H+  +  60 e−  (18) 526

19 The mineralization current efficiencies for the experiments given i n Figs. 7a and 7b were 529
then calculated from Eq. 12, considering reaction (18) to evaluate ∆(TOC) theor. The 530
corresponding MCE-time plots thus obtained are presented in Figs. 9a and 9b. In all cases this 531
parameter undergoes a dramatic fall with electrolysis time, as expected if products that are 532
more difficultly oxidizable with •OH than the initial compound, such as short carboxylic 533
acids, are progressively formed. In contrast, all electro-Fenton treatments become much more 534
efficient when current drops. For example, Figure 9a shows that after 60 min of electrolysis in 535
the BDD/O 2 diffusion cell, increasing MCE values of 10%, 12%, 14% and 19% are obtained 536
for decreasing currents of 300, 200, 100 and 60 mA, respectively. Under these same 537
conditions, Figure 9b also shows a gradual rise in efficiency of 30%, 41%, 71% and ca. 100% 538
for the Pt/carbon felt cell. This trend is contrary to the concomitant fall in TOC removal found 539
in these systems due to the smaller production of ƔOH from reactions (1) and (8) (see Figs. 7a 540
and 7b). The increase in efficiency with decreasing current can then be ascribed to the higher 541
decay in rate of non-oxidizing reactions of this radical, such as reaction (2), giving rise to a 542
larger relative proportion of ƔOH with ability to react with pollutants. On the other hand, 543
comparison of Figs. 9a and 9b for the trials at 300 mA confirms that the efficiency for 544
chlorophene degradation in the cells, at least at the early stages of treatment, increases in the 545
order: Pt/O 2 diffusion < BDD/O 2 diffusion < BDD/carbon felt < Pt/carbon felt. This can be 546
easily deduced taking into account that after 60 min of electrolysis, for example, the 547
corresponding MCE values are 8.3%, 10%, 17% and 30%. 548
 All these findings show that chlorophene can be totally mineralized in the Pt/carbon felt, 549
BDD/carbon felt and BDD/O 2 diffusion cells under electro-Fent on conditions, raising their 550
efficiency as current decreases. The action of the Fe3+/Fe2+ catalytic system is optimal in the 551
Pt/carbon felt cell, which yields the highest degradation rate at the beginning of electrolysis 552
with efficiency close to 100% at low current. However, the BDD/carbon felt cell has the 553
highest oxidizing power for overall mineralization at high current due to the greater oxidation 554
ability of BDD than Pt. These systems are then viable for the treatment of wastewaters 555
containing this antimicrobial. 556

203.4. Identification and time-course of intermediates 560
 Reversed-phase chromatograms of solutions treated by all electro-Fenton systems did not  561
display any identified peak related to aromatic intermediates coming from chlorophene 562
oxidation. Several attempts were then made to try to identify some of such products by 563
electrolyzing 50 mg l-1 of the antimicrobial with either 4 mM or 1 mM Fe3+ at 60 mA for 30 564
min usin g the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell with the l owest oxi dizing power. However, the GC-MS 565
analyses of collected organics only showed the presence of the remaining chlorophene. These 566
findings evidence that its aromatic products are always oxidized at the same rate as formed, 567
without being accumulated in the solution. 568
 Generated carboxylic acids were identified by analyzing the treated solutions by ion- 569
exclusion chromatography. These chromatograms displayed well-defined peaks ascribed to 570
oxalic acid at tr = 7.8 min, maleic acid at tr = 9.4 min, glyoxylic acid at tr = 11.4 min, malonic 571
acid at tr = 11.7 min, glycolic acid at tr = 14.5 min, formic acid at tr = 16.0 min and fumaric 572
acid at tr = 17.0 min. Maleic, glycolic, malonic and fumaric acids come from the oxidation of 573
the aryl moiety of aromatic products, whereas glyoxylic acid is formed from the degradation 574
of glycolic acid [11,20,31,42]. Further oxidation of these products yields formic and oxalic 575
acids that are transformed  in to  CO 2. The production of oxalic acid was corroborated by 576
treating 50 mg l-1 of chlorophene with 4 mM Fe3+ at 60 mA for 120 min in the Pt/O 2 diffusion 577
cell. The GC-MS analysis after esterification of the remaining acids with ethanol revealed the 578
presence of an intense peak related to diethyl oxalate (m/z = 146 (2, M+)) at tr = 7.9 min. 579
 Once the identification of chromatographic peaks was made, the concentration of the 580
different carboxylic acids during the treatment of 84 mg l-1 chlorophene solutions in the four 581
electro-Fenton systems at 60 and 300 mA was determi ned as a function of electrolysis time 582
via external calibration by using standard compounds. The evolution of formic and oxalic 583
acids for these trials is presented in Figs. 10a and 10b, respectively. 584
 For the cells containing an O 2-diffusion cathode and 4.0 mM Fe3+, maleic, malonic and 585
fumaric acids were detected at concentrations < 3 mg l-1 only operating at 60 mA for 60 min 586
as maximum, similarly to formic acid (see Fig. 10a). In contrast, oxalic acid is largely 587
accumulated at 60 and 300 mA, remaining in solution up to the end of both treatments. Figure 588
10b shows that in the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell this acid reaches 88 mg l-1 after 240 min of 589PART B  –Results and Discussion -

corresponding to 18 mg l-1 of TOC, a value much lower than 30 mg l-1 found for the 591
remaining solution (see Fig. 7a). This indicates that the solution also contains other 592
undetected products that are hardly oxidized by •OH produced in the medium by Fenton’s 593
reaction (1) and at the Pt anode by reaction (8). In this system all iron ions are accumulated as 594
Fe3+ (see Fig. 2a) and hence, the majority of oxalic acid is expected to be in the form of Fe3+- 595
oxalate complexes, which can not be oxidized by •OH in solution [5,54]. The quite slow 596
destruction of these species in the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell can then be ascri bed to their hard 597
mineralization to CO 2 with •OH at the Pt surface, thus confirming the low oxidation ability of 598
this anode. A similar behavior can be seen in Fig. 10b for the BDD/O 2 diffusion cell at 60 599
mA, where oxalic acid attains a quasi steady-concentration of 45 mg l-1 at times longer than 600
180 min, corresponding to 12mg l-1 of TOC, a value very far from 40 mg l-1 of TOC 601
determined for the fin al electrolyzed solution, as can b e seen in Fig. 7a. At this low current, 602
this system is unable t o destroy Fe3+-oxalate complexes and other undetected products. 603
However, when the current rises to 300 mA, oxalic acid (see Fig. 10b) and the solution TOC 604
(see Fig. 7a) are completely removed at 660 min. The overall mineralization of chlorophene 605
in the BDD/O 2 diffusion cell at 300 mA can be explained by the efficient oxidation of final 606
Fe3+-oxalate complexes with •OH on BDD, as expected from its great oxidizing power at high 607
current [12-22]. 608
 Maleic, malonic, fumaric, glycolic, glyoxylic and formic acids were found in larger 609
extent and during longer time in  the Pt/carbon felt cell th an in the BDD/carbon felt one using 610
0.2 mM Fe3+ at 60 mA, but were not detected at 300 mA due to their faster destruction. For 611
example, Figure 10a shows a great accumulation of formic acid up to 17 mg l-1 at 120 min of 612
electrolysis in the first system at 60 mA and its complete mineralization in ca. 360 min, 613
whereas for the second system, this acid only persists for 120 min, reaching 1.5 mg l-1 as 614
maximum. These resu lts indicate that in the Pt/carbon felt cell all aro matic in termediates are 615
transformed into carboxylic acids, because they react rapidly with the large amounts of •OH 616
formed from Fenton’s reaction (1), which is enhanced by the fast regeneration of Fe2+ at the 617
cathode from reaction (10). Even the persistent final oxalic acid can be totally converted i nto 618
CO 2 under these conditions at ca. 540 min (see Fig. 10b), when all solution TOC is removed 619PART B  –Results and Discussion -

22(see Fig. 7b). The mineralization of this acid is accelerated with increasing current due to the 620
quicker production of oxidant •OH, as can be observed in Fig. 10b, attaining a maximum 621
content of 33 and 21 mg l-1 after 120 min of electrolysis at 60 and 300 mA, respectively. The 622
low concentration of iron ions, practically all of them as Fe2+ (see Fig. 2b), in the solution 623
treated in the Pt/carbon felt cell suggests the formation of quite a small proportion of Fe2+- 624
oxalato complexes, and hence, this acid and its Fe2+ complexes are directly oxidized with •OH 625
in the medium, since they can not be destroyed by this radical on Pt [12].  626
 The lower accumulation of carboxylic acids in the BDD/carbon felt cell can be related to 627
a slower destruction of aromatics since •OH is generated to a lesser extent from Fenton’s 628
reaction (1), because of the parallel oxidation of Fe2+ with S 2O82− from reaction (16). This 629
agrees with the fact that the efficiency found in this cell is lower than in the Pt/carbon felt one 630
during the early stages for both treatments at 300 mA (see Fig. 9). However, in the 631
BDD/carbon felt cell the degradation of carboxylic acids is enhanced by their simultaneous 632
oxidation at the BDD surface, mainly at high current when this a node produces a large 633
amount of •OH from reaction (8). This behavior can be confirmed in Fig. 10b from the 634
corresponding evolution of oxalic acid, since it disappears in only 360 min at 300 mA, but in 635
contrast it needs more than 540 min t o be removed at 60 mA, when it is mainly destroyed by 636
•OH in solution. The faster destruction of this acid in the BDD/carbon felt cell in comparison 637
to the other electro-Fenton systems at high current accounts for its highest oxidizing power 638
for total min eraliza tion. 639
 The possible reaction paths of oxalic acid, that is the ultimate by-product generated along 640
the mineralization before the conversion of all the initial organic carbon into CO 2, in the 641
electro-Fenton systems are schematized in Fig. 11. In the cells with an O 2-diffusion cathode 642
Fe3+-oxalate co mp lexes are accumu lated  in large extent, so the overall min eralization is 643
uniquely achieved by •OH on a BDD anode at high current. In the cells with a carbon-felt 644
cathode, oxalic acid can be directly transformed into CO 2 by •OH formed in solution. When a 645
Pt anode is used under these conditions, this oxidant can also destroy Fe2+-oxalate complexes 646
present in small proportion, whereas for BDD, oxalic acid and its Fe2+ and Fe3+ complexes 647
can also be oxi dized by the efficient •OH formed at the anode surface at high current. 648

234. Conclusions 650
651
 The catalytic behavior of the Fe3+/Fe2+ system in the electro-Fenton degradation of 652
chl orophene solutions with 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 and different Fe3+ concentrations of pH 3.0 653
mainly depends on the cathode tested. The cells with either a Pt or BDD anode and an O 2- 654
diffusion cathode yield a large accumulation of electrogenerated H 2O2 while Fe3+ content 655
remains practically constant. Chlorophene falls more rapidly with raising Fe3+ concentration 656
up to 8.0 mM, since more amount of oxidant •OH is formed from Fenton’s reaction (1) due to 657
the higher amount of Fe2+ regenerated at the O 2-diffusion cathode from reaction (10). In 658
contrast, the latter reaction is so fast at a carbon-felt cathode that Fe2+ is largely accumulated, 659
but H 2O2 is electro generated in small extent. This is feasib le by the much  slower oxidation of 660
Fe2+ at Pt and BDD from reaction (10), as explained by the pseudo-first-order rate constants 661
determined. In these systems the antimicrobial decay is enhanced with raising current thanks 662
to the higher generation of H 2O2 and Fe2+ leading to greater amount of •OH from Fenton’s 663
reaction (1), only being required 0.2 mM Fe3+ to obtain its maximum production under all 664
applied currents. The removal rate of chlorophene is always lower in the cells with BDD than 665
with Pt, because Fe2+ is less accumulated since it is also oxidized with peroxodisulfate 666
generated at the BDD anode. A second-order rate constant of (1.00 ±0.01)x1010 M-1 s-1 is 667
determined for the reaction between chlorophene and •OH in solution from the method of 668
competitive kinetics with benzoic acid. Concentrated solutions of the antimicrobial are poorly 669
decontaminated in the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell with 4.0 mM Fe3+, whereas total mineralization is 670
achieved using the BDD/O 2 diffusion cell with 4.0 mM Fe3+ at high current and the Pt/carbon 671
felt and BDD/carbon felt cells with 0.2 mM Fe3+. The initial chlorine is completely released 672
as chloride ion, which remains stable in solution using a Pt anode, but it is oxidized to Cl 2 on 673
BDD. At the early stages of treatment, the efficiency for the degradation process in the cells 674
increases in the order: Pt/O 2 diffusion < BDD/O 2 diffusion < BDD/carbon felt < Pt/carbon 675
felt, although it always rises with decreasing current. The hard oxidation of final Fe3+-oxalate 676
complexes and other undetected products with •OH in the medium and at the Pt surface 677
accounts for the poor degradation in the Pt/O 2 diffusion cell. These species are co mpletely 678
mineralized at a BDD anode at high current due to the great production of reactive •OH on its 679PART B  –Results and Discussion -

24surface. In the cells with a carbon-felt cathode oxalic acid and its Fe2+ complexes are directly 680
oxidized with •OH in the medium. The highest oxidizing power for total mineralization at 681
high current is attained for the BDD/carbon felt cell, when this acid can be simultaneously 682
destroyed on BDD. These results show that electro-Fenton is a viable environmentally 683
friendly technology for t he remediation of wastewaters containing chl orophene. 684

decontaminate ȱwastewaters ȱcontaining ȱparacetamol, ȱclofibricȱacidȱandȱ
chlorophene ȱinȱaȱwideȱrangeȱofȱexperimental ȱconditions. ȱAllȱofȱthemȱareȱsuitableȱ
toȱdestroyȱtheȱinitialȱpollutant, ȱandȱmostȱofȱthemȱareȱevenȱableȱtoȱcompletely ȱ

lessȱoxidizing ȱmethods ȱreported ȱinȱliterature ȱtoȱremoveȱtheseȱpharmaceuticals. ȱEFȱ
