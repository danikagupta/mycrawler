 iii Foreword  
The United States Environmental Protection Agency is charged by Congress with protectin g the 
Nation’s land, air, and water resources. Under a mandate of national environmental laws, the 
Agency strives to formulate and implement action leading to a compatible balance between 
human activities and the ability of natural systems to support and n urture life. To meet this man -
date, EPA’s research program is providing data and technical support for solving environ mental 
problems today and building a science knowledge base necessary to manage our ecologi cal 
resources wisely, understand how pollutan ts affect our health, and prevent or reduce environ -
mental risks in the future.  
 
The National Risk Management Research Laboratory is the Agency’s center for investigation of 
technological and management approaches for reducing risks from threats to human h ealth and 
the environment. The focus of the Laboratory’s research program is on methods for prevention 
and control of pollution to air, land, water, and subsurface resources: protection of water quality in 
public water systems; remediation of contaminated sites and ground water; and prevention and 
control of indoor air. The goal of this research effort is to evaluate the performance on a full -scale 
level of five processes, including coagulation/filtration, lime softening, iron oxidation/fil tration, ion 
exchange, and activated alumina, to consistently remove arsenic over a sustained period of time 
(1 year).

 ivAbstract 
This report documents treatment plant information as well as  results of sampling and analysis at 
two iron removal plants (referred to as Plants A and B). The objective of sampling and analysis 
was to evaluate the effectiveness of the water treatment plants to consistently remove arsenic 
(As) from source water. Addi tionally, data were collected in this study to evaluate the chemical 
characteristics of residuals produced by the treatment processes.  
 
The study was divided into three phases: source water sampling, preliminary sampling, and long -
term evaluation. The fir st phase, source water sampling, was conducted to evaluate source water 
characteristics at each plant. The second phase, pre liminary sampling, was initiated at Plant A in 
April 1998 and at Plant B in May 1998. This phase consisted of a four -week sampling  period to 
refine procedures for subsequent events during the third phase. The third phase, long -term 
evaluation, consisted of weekly sample collection and analysis begin ning in June 1998 and 
continuing through June 1999 at Plant A and through December 19 98 at Plant B. Plant personnel 
conducted all sampling during the long -term eval uation phase and Battelle coordinated sampling 
logistics. Sludge samples also were collected at Plant A during a single sampling event from an 
outdoor settling pond in Novembe r 1998. Samples of supernatant discharge (Plant A) and recycle 
supernatant (Plant B) were collected monthly beginning in November 1998 and con tinuing until 
June 1999 at Plant A and until January 1999 at Plant B.  
 
Results from the long -term evaluation pha se were varied regarding the ability of the iron removal 
process to consistently achieve low -level arsenic concentrations (e.g., <5 µg/L in the fin ished 
water). The total arsenic concentrations at Plant A were reduced by an average of 87%, which 
represents a decrease in average arsenic concentration from 20.3 µg/L to 3.0 µg/L. Adsorption 
and copre cipitation with iron hydroxide precipitates are believed to be the primary arsenic removal 
mechanisms. The total arsenic concentrations at Plant B were reduced  by an average of 74%, 
which represents a decrease in average arsenic concentration from 48.5 µg/L to 11.9 µg/L. At 
Plant B, it appeared that only the particulate arsenic in the source water was removed. This par -
ticulate ar senic was most likely associat ed with the oxidized iron particles present in the source 
water (i.e., arsenic sorbed onto iron particles). The primary difference in arsenic removal effi ciency 
at Plants A and B is believed to be the amount of iron in the source water. Source water at Pl ant A 
averaged 2,284  µg/L of iron, while Plant B averaged 1,137 µg/L. Increasing the iron in the source 
water at Plant B using a coagulant, such as ferric chloride, would likely enable Plant B to con sist-
ently achieve lower levels of arsenic.  
 
None of the  sludge samples collected at Plant A qualified as a hazardous waste based on the 
Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test for metals. Therefore, nonhazardous waste  
landfills should be able to accept the sludge generated by this treatment faci lity. Stricter haz ard-
ous waste classification regulations in some states, such as California, on total arsenic con cen-
trations in solid waste also were met at Plant A. Sludge samples were not collected at Plant  B; 
however, analytical results were provid ed from a 1994 sludge sampling event.

 xiAcknowledgments  
Sincere appreciation is extended to the two water treatment facilities that participated in this study.  
The staff from each facility contributed greatly to this project by collecting samples every week for 
more than 12 months at Plant A and more than 6 months at Plant B. Their work on this project 
was uncompensated, making th eir superb efforts even more remarkable. Personnel from both 
plants are thanked for their hard work and dedication throughout the duration of this project.  
 
 
 
  
 1 1.0  Introduction  
This project consists, in part, of a field study to collect 
drinking water s amples from various locations through -
out the treatment processes at two iron removal plants. 
These samples were analyzed and used to evaluate the 
effectiveness of conventional iron removal processes to 
consistently reduce arsenic (As) in source water to low 
levels. This project also includes the collection of pro -
cess residual samples that were used to determine the 
quantity and chemical characteristics of the residuals pro -
duced by the treatment processes. This report de scribes 
the design and operation  of the two treatment plants and 
presents the analytical results of the water samples col -
lected during the study.  
 
1.1  Background  
The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 man dates 
that the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) identify a nd regulate drinking water con taminants 
that may have an adverse human health effect and that 
are known or anticipated to occur in public water supply 
systems. Arsenic is a naturally occurring contaminant 
that has known adverse human health effects. Exces sive 
amounts of arsenic can cause acute gastrointestinal (GI) 
and cardiac damage. Chronic doses can cause vascular 
disorders such as blackfoot disease (Chen et al., 1994), 
and epidemio logical studies have linked arsenic to skin 
and lung cancer (Tate and A rnold, 1990). In 1975, under 
the SDWA, EPA estab lished a maximum contaminant  
level (MCL) for arsenic at 0.05  mg/L. Since that time, revi -
sion of the MCL has been con sidered a number of times, 
but no change has been made. The SDWA was amended 
in 1996, and  these amendments required that the EPA 
develop an arsenic research strategy and pub lish a pro-
posal to revise the arsenic MCL by January 2000.  
 
A draft arsenic research plan was prepared by the EPA 
in December 1996 and was finalized in February 1998 
based upon a technical review by the EPA’s Board of 
Scientific Counselors (EPA, 1998). The plan identifies the 
research needed by the EPA to support a proposed revi -
sion of the arsenic MCL. The plan also identifies a num -
ber of treatment methods available fo r arsenic re moval and recog nizes the need to determine the capa bility of 
these technologies to remove arsenic to a level sig nifi-
cantly lower than the current MCL. This study was con -
ducted as part of an EPA Work Assignment (WA) to  
determine the abi lity of conventional water treat ment pro-
cesses to consistently remove arsenic from drinking water.  
 
1.1.1  General Chemistry of Arsenic  
Arsenic is a common, naturally occurring drinking water 
contaminant that originates from arsenic -containing rocks  
and soil and is transported to natural waters through 
erosion and dissolution. Arsenic occurs in natural waters 
in both organic and inorganic forms. However, inorganic 
arsenic is predominant in natural waters and is the most 
likely form of arsenic to exist at  concentrations that cause  
regulatory concern (Edwards et al., 1998).  
 
The valence and species of inorganic arsenic are de -
pendent on the oxidation -reduction conditions and the 
pH of the water. As a general rule of thumb, the reduced, 
trivalent from [As (III)] normally is found in ground water 
(assuming anaerobic conditions) and the oxidized, pen -
tavalent form [As(V)] is found in surface water (as suming 
aerobic conditions), although this rule does not always 
hold true for ground water, where both form s have been 
found togeth er in the same water source. Arsenate 
exists in four forms in aqueous solution based on pH: 
H3AsO4, H2AsO4–
, HAsO42–
, and AsO 43–
. Similarly, arse nite 
exists in five forms: H 4AsO3+
, H3AsO3, H2AsO3–
, HAsO32–
, 
and AsO33–
. As shown in  Figure 1-1, which contains solu -
bility diagrams for As(III) and As(V), ionic forms of arsen -
ate dominate at pH >3, and arsenite is neutral at pH <9 
and ionic at pH >9. Conventional treat ment tech nologies 
used for arsenic removal, such as iron remov al, rely on  
adsorption and copre cipitation of arsenic to metal hydrox -
ides. There fore, the valence and species of solu ble arse-
nic are very significant in evalu ating arsenic removal.  
 
Although soluble arsenic species typically make up the 
majority of the total arsenic concentration in natural  
waters, some research indicates that arsenic can exist as 
particulate at significant concentrations. Studies by  Cheng   
 2 
 
 
Figure 1-1.  Solubility Diagrams for As(III) and As(V)   
 3 et al. (1994) and Hemond (1995) measured par ticulate 
arsenic at levels of 17 and 50% of the total arse nic con-
centration, respectively, in subject source waters. There -
fore, determination of the particulate arse nic concentration 
is important because i t can provide insight into the arse -
nic removal mechanisms that occur during treat ment. 
 
1.1.2  Determination of Arsenic Species  
Although total arsenic can be effectively preserved in 
field samples, presently no method exists to consistently 
preserve ino rganic arsenic species in field samples. 
Preservation of total arsenic is accomplished by acidi -
fying the sample to pH <2 in the field. However, a high 
level of ambiguity exists when acids such as nitric acid 
(HNO3) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) are used to preserve 
inorganic species of arsenic. Interconversion of As(III) 
and As(V) in samples preserved with 0.05 N HCl have 
been reported to occur within one day (Andreae, 1977). 
Another laboratory study conducted by Eaton et al. 
(1997) examined preservation of arsenic using humic 
acid, ascorbic acid, and HCl; the study concluded that no 
effective method exists for preserving As(III) and As(V) 
in water samples. Some researchers have used freezing 
of samples as a means of preserving the inorganic spe -
cies of arsen ic. However, freezing is neither a cost -
effective nor a practical method for field sampling.  
 
In response to the lack of techniques available for ade -
quately preserving arsenic species, field speciation pro -
tocols have been developed by Ficklin (1982), Cli fford et 
al. (1983), and Edwards et al. (1998). In each of these 
studies, an anion exchange resin column is used for field 
speciation of arsenic. Ficklin (1982) used a strong anion 
exchange resin (Dowex 1 × 8, 100 -200 mesh, acetate 
form) in a 10 cm × 7 mm glass column to separate 
As(III) from As(V) in water samples that had been fil tered 
through a 0.45 -µm membrane filter and acidi fied with 1% 
HCl. The resin was supplied in chloride form and was 
converted to the acetate form. However, in the protocol by 
Clifford et al. (1983), a chloride -form strong base anion  
resin (ASB -2, 30-60 mesh) was used to sepa rate As(III) 
from As(V). In this method, the sample was not filtered 
or preserved with acid. Both Ficklin and Clifford used a 
graphite-furnace atomic -absorption spec trophotometer 
(GFAAS) to deter mine the arsenic con centration. 
 
More recently, Edwards et al. (1998) made the following 
modifications to Ficklin’s method: (1)  Substituted 50 -100 
mesh resin for the 100 -200 mesh resin to allow faster 
sample flow. (2) Used 12  cm × 15 mm poly propylene col -
umns to improve safety and speed of sample treat ment. 
(3) Used 0.05% H 2SO4 instead of 1% HCl to acid ify 
samples prior to resin treatment. Edwards et al.’s use of 
H2SO4 helped to prevent potential problems associated 
  with overacidifica tion of the sample, and also helped to 
prevent Cl–
 from interfering with the induc tively coupled 
plasma/mass spec trometry (ICP -MS) analysis. The re -
ported recoveries of As(III) and As(V) ranged from 80 to 
120% by Ficklin  (1982), 95 to 117% by Clifford et al. 
(1983), and 100 to 105% by Edwards et al. (1998). For 
this study, the decision was made to utilize a field spe ci-
ation technique similar to that used by Edwards et al. 
(1998). 
 
1.1.3  Treatment Technologies for 
Arsenic Removal  
Several common treatment technologies are used for the 
removal of inorganic contaminants, includ ing arsenic, from  
drinking water supplies. Large -scale treatment facil ities 
often use conventional coagulation with alum or iron salts  
followed by filtration to remove arsenic. Chem ical precipi-
tation is another common, conventional treat ment process 
used for water softening as well as iron and man ganese 
removal that can potentially remove arsenic from source 
waters. Smaller -scale systems and point-of-entry systems 
often use anion exchange resins or acti vated alu mina. 
Other arsenic removal technologies in clude man ganese 
greensand, reverse osmosis, electro dialysis reversal 
(EDR), nano filtration, and ad sorption on acti vated carbon. 
This report focuses on iron removal, a con ventional treat -
ment process used for arsenic removal at large -scale 
operations. Two addi tional reports have been de veloped 
for (1) coagulation/filtration and lime soft ening plants and 
(2) anion exchange and activated alumina plants.  
 
Chemical precipitation/filtration commonly is used for re -
moval of iron from source waters. This process, re ferred 
to in this document as iron removal, involves two major 
steps: (1) oxidation of reduced iron,  Fe(II), to the rela -
tively insolu ble Fe(III) in order to form precipi tates; and 
(2) filtration of the water to remove the precip itated iron 
hydroxides. The most common oxidants used to precipi -
tate soluble iron are air, chlorine, and potas sium per-
manganate. 
 
Iron removal can be used to remove arsenic from drink -
ing water. Two pri mary removal mechanisms exist: ad -
sorption and copre cipitation (Benefield and Morgan, 
1990). During the adsorp tion process, dissolved arsenic 
attaches to the surface  of a particle or precipitate. And 
during the coprecip itation process, dissolved arsenic is 
adsorbed to a par ticle and entrapped as the particle con -
tinues to agglom erate. The following major steps occur 
when using iron removal for arsenic treatment: ( 1) the sol-
uble iron and any As(III) are oxidized; (2) As(V) at taches 
to the iron hydroxides through adsorption and/or copre cip-
itation; and (3) the particle/precipitate subse quently is fil-
tered from the water.  
  
 4 Several bench - and pilot -scale studi es and some short -
term full-scale evaluations have been conducted to eval -
uate arsenic removal during iron hydroxide precipi tation. 
Most of the studies have focused on removal of As(V) 
rather than As(III) because better As(V) removal can be 
achieved under  comparable conditions and As(III) can 
be easily converted to As(V) using a strong oxidant such 
as chlorine (Hering et al., 1996; Sorg, 1993). McNeill and 
Edwards (1995) conducted a survey of full -scale treat -
ment facilities and observed that arsenic remov al effi-
ciencies of 80 to 95 percent were obtained at facili ties 
with greater than 1.5 mg/L Fe(II) in the source water. 
However, arsenic removal efficiency may be reduced in 
the presence of orthophosphate, natural organic matter 
(NOM), and silicate due t o competition for sorptive sites 
on iron hydroxide precipitates (Edwards, 1994; Meng et 
al., 2000).  
 
Previous studies also indicate that arsenic removal dur -
ing iron hydroxide precipitation is directly correlated with 
the initial, or inlet, iron concentrat ion (i.e., arsenic re -
moval efficiency increases with increasing iron con cen-
trations) (Sorg and Logsdon, 1978; Sorg, 1993; Hering 
et al., 1996; Gulledge and O’Conner, 1973). Also, arse -
nic removal effi ciency appears to be inde pendent of ini-
tial arsenic concentration at levels of interest to drinking 
water treatment (Hering et al., 1996; Cheng et al., 1994; 
Edwards, 1994). Other research indicates that As(V) 
removal is not pH -dependent between pH 5.5 and 8.5 for 
iron hydroxide precipitation (Sorg an d Logsdon, 1978; 
Sorg, 1993; Hering et al., 1996).  
 
1.1.4  Data Gaps  
The removal of arsenic from drinking water by adsorp -
tion and coprecipitation with metal hydroxides has been 
extensively stud ied at the laboratory and pilot -scale level.  
Although some sh ort-term full-scale evalu ations have 
been performed for iron removal, little data exist on the 
capability of (natural) iron removal in full -scale appli ca-
tions to reduce arsenic on a sustained basis. Thus, a 
need exists to deter mine the effectiveness of  the iron removal process to produce drinking water with low lev -
els of arsenic on a long -term basis, under varying opera -
tional and seasonal conditions.  
 
Another data gap is the gen eration and disposal of resid -
uals from conventional drink ing water tre atment pro ces-
ses. Currently, little or no data exist on the amounts and 
the chemical com position of re siduals generated by the  
arsenic removal pro cesses and the environ mental impacts 
of their disposal. Therefore, infor mation needs to be col -
lected on the quantity and the chemical charac teristics of 
the wastes produced by iron removal plants.  
 
1.2  Objectives  
One objective of this study was to evaluate the effec tive-
ness of conventional iron removal to con sistently reduce 
arsenic con centrations in source water to low levels. 
This report pre sents the results of weekly monitoring for 
approximately one year and 6 months at Plants A and B, 
respectively.  
 
Another objective of this study was to examine the resid -
uals produced during treatment at ir on removal plants. 
Information was collected on the chemical char acteristics 
of the wastes produced by these drinking water treat ment 
processes.

 5 2.0  Conclusions  
The U.S. EPA has begun the process of revising the 
arsenic MCL. It is anticipated that the revised limit will be 
significantly lower than the current MCL of 0.05 mg/L. 
Therefore, there is a need to determine the a bility of exist -
ing treatment processes to consistently remove arse nic 
to low levels. The pri mary objectives of this study were to 
document arsenic removal at two iron removal plants, 
and to assess poten tial impacts of residuals  (sludge and 
supernatant water) at these treatment plants.  
 
The study was divided into three major phases: source 
water sampling (February 1998), preliminary sampling 
(April and May 1998), and long -term sampling (June 
1998 through June 1999). For the first phase, Battelle 
staff traveled to each facility to conduct source water 
sampling, which provided information on source water 
characteristics. The second phase, preliminary sampling, 
consisted of a four -week sampling period to refine the 
sampling approach before implementing the long-term 
sampling phase. Battelle staff again traveled to each 
facility to coordinate the first sampling event and train 
plant personnel in sampling procedures for subsequent 
events. The third phase, long -term evaluation, consisted 
of weekly collect ion and analysis of water sam ples at both 
water treatment plants. The long -term eval uation also  
included sludge sampling (November 1998 at Plant A  
only), supernatant discharge sampling (November 1998  
through June 1999 at Plant A), and recycle super natant 
sampling (Novem ber 1998 through January 1999 at 
Plant B). During the long -term sampling, plant per sonnel 
conducted sampling and Battelle coordinated sam pling 
logistics. 
 
The primary focus of this study was the long -term per-
formance of the two iron r emoval plants. Total arsenic 
concentrations at Plant A were reduced from an average of 20.3 µg/L to 3.0 µg/L. Total arsenic concentrations at 
Plant B were reduced from an average of 48.5 µg/L to 
11.9 µg/L. Adsorption and coprecipitation of As(V) with 
iron hydroxides precipitates are believed to be the pri -
mary arsenic removal mechanism at Plant A. Plant A 
oxidized As(III) in the source water to As(V) using chlori -
nation. At Plant B, it appeared that only the par ticulate 
arsenic in the source water was rem oved. Par ticulate 
arsenic most likely represents the arsenic sorbed to oxi -
dized iron particles. The primary difference in arsenic 
removal between Plants A and B is believed to be the 
amount of iron in the source water. Source water at 
Plant A averaged 2, 284 µg/L of iron, while Plant B aver -
aged 1,137 µg/L. Therefore, increas ing the available iron 
at Plant B by using a coagulant such as ferric chlo ride 
would likely enable Plant B to consistently achieve lower 
levels of arsenic.  
 
The secondary focus of th is study was on the chemical 
characteristics of the residuals generated during the treat -
ment processes. None of the sludge samples col lected at 
Plant A qual ified as a hazardous waste based on Tox -
icity Char acteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) tests f or 
metals. Therefore, sludge generated by this plant should 
be accepted by nonhazardous waste land fills. Sludge 
samples were not collected at Plant B; how ever, the plant 
did provide analytical results from a 1994 sampling event. 
TCLP tests were not perf ormed on this sample, although 
the total arsenic concentration exceed ed stricter require -
ments in California regarding hazard ous waste clas sifica-
tion. Supernatant water from the set tling pond at Plant  A 
was discharged to the san itary sewer, where as backwash 
water at Plant B was allowed to set tle in a con crete vat 
then combined with the source water. The recycle super -
natant at Plant B did not appear to adverse ly impact treat -
ment plant opera tions. 
  
 6 3.0  Materials and Methods  
This section di scusses the materials and methods used 
for performing the source water, prelimi nary, and long -
term sampling and data collection at two iron removal 
plants. Section 3.1 describes the general project ap -
proach. Section 3.2 describes the preparation of arsen ic 
speciation kits and sample coolers. Section 3.3 provides 
detailed sampling procedures. Sec tion 3.4 discusses per -
tinent analytical procedures.  
 
3.1  General Project Approach  
Several consecutive tasks were performed to accom plish 
the study objecti ves described in Section 1.2. These tasks  
involved the following activities:  
 
• Select treatment plants and conduct an initial site 
visit to collect source water samples at each 
selected plant  
• Prepare a preliminary sampling and data collection 
plan for each plant 
• Finalize the sampling and data collection plan after 
completion of four weekly preliminary sampling 
events at each plant  
• Implement the final sampling and data collection 
plan with weekly sampling events at each plant for 
up to one year.  
For initial plant selection, a list of potential treatment 
plant candidates was compiled. Plant operators or other 
key personnel were contacted via telephone to obtain/ 
confirm information and solicit interest in participating in 
the project. Each facility was evalua ted on the following 
criteria: source water arsenic concentrations, source 
water type, available manpower to conduct the year -long 
study, availability of historical arsenic data, and plant 
size. Battelle recommended the selection of two iron 
removal plants  (designated as Plants A and B) for initial 
site visits and source water sampling. These recom men-
dations were later approved by the EPA Work Assign -
ment Manager (WAM). The information col lected during 
the site visits, including the concen tration and s peciation of arsenic in each source water, was tabu lated and used 
as the basis for the final plant selection.  
 
Following the final plant selection (Plants A and B were 
selected), a preliminary sam pling and data collection plan  
was prepared for each plant  to document the plant’s oper -
ation and performance for arsenic removal and the cri -
tical parameters that would impact the removal. Each 
preliminary plan also described the data collection effort 
to characterize the resi duals produced by the treatment 
process. The ap proved prelim inary plans were imple -
mented at both plants over a four -week trial period. A 
Battelle staff mem ber revisited the plants during the first 
week of the trial period to observe plant operations, per -
form sam pling, conduct trainin g of plant support per -
sonnel, and establish/coordinate all re quired logistics 
(such as re ceiving/shipping of sample coolers, chain -of-
custody coor dination, communication methods, and emer -
gency/contingency plans). The remain ing three sam pling 
events during the preliminary sampling were performed 
by a designated point of contact (POC) or an alternate at 
each plant. The experience gained during the trial period 
was used to finalize the long -term sam pling and data 
collection plans.  
 
All water and r esidual samples were collected and ana -
lyzed in accordance with the Category III Quality Assur -
ance Project Plan (QAPP) prepared by Battelle (1998) 
for this project. Water samples were collected week ly 
from four sampling locations at Plant A: (1) the inle t to 
the treatment plant (IN); (2) before the filtration process 
(prefiltration [PF]); (3) after the fil tration process (AF); 
and (4) after a final zeolite resin soften ing process (AS). 
Also, water samples were collected weekly from three 
sampling loca tions at Plant B: (1) the inlet to the treat ment 
plant (IN); (2) before the filtration process (PF); (3) and 
after the filtration process at the plant outlet (AF). During 
the preliminary and long -term sampling phases, field arse -
nic specia tion sampling was conducted once every four 
weeks. Starting from Novem ber 1998, sam ples of super -
natant discharge (from a settling pond at  Plant A) or recy -
cle supernatant (from a concrete vat at Plant B) were 
collected once every four weeks from each plant. Finally,   
 7 three sludge samples were collected from the settling 
pond at Plant A during one sampling event.  
 
All sample containers and arsenic speciation kits were 
prepared and sent in coolers on a weekly basis to each 
plant via Federal Express. The coolers were ret urned to 
Battelle immediately after the sample collection had been 
completed. Analyses of arsenic, alum inum, iron, and 
manganese in water were conducted by Battelle using 
an ICP-MS method. Wilson Environmental Labora tories 
in Westerville, OH, was subc ontracted to per form all 
other chemical analyses. Battelle coordinated all sam -
pling logistics.  
 
3.2  Preparation of Sampling Kits 
and Sample Coolers 
All arsenic speciation kits, recycle supernatant/super na-
tant discharge sampling kits, and sample cooler s were 
prepared at Battelle. The following sections describe the 
relevant preparation procedures.  
 
3.2.1  Preparation of Arsenic 
Speciation  Kits 
The arsenic field speciation method used an anion ex -
change resin col umn to separate the soluble arsenic 
species, As(V) and As(III). A 250 -mL bottle (identified as 
bottle A) was used to contain an unfiltered sample, 
which was analyzed to determine the total arsenic con -
centration (both soluble and particulate). The soluble 
portion of the sample was obtained by  passing the unfil -
tered sample through a 0.45 -µm screw -on disc filter to 
remove any particulate arsenic and col lecting the filtrate 
in a 125-mL bottle (identified as bottle B). Bottle B con -
tained 0.05% (volume/volume) ultra -pure sulfuric acid to 
acidify the sample to about pH 2. At this pH, As(III) was 
completely proton ated as H 3AsO3, and As(V) was pres -
ent in both ionic (i.e., H 2AsO4–
) and protonated forms 
(i.e., H3AsO4) (see Fig ure 1-1). A portion of the acidified 
sample in bottle B was run through the resin column. 
The resin retained the As(V) and allowed As(III) (i.e., 
H3AsO3) to pass through the column. (Note that the resin 
will retain only H 2AsO4–
 and that H 3AsO4, when passing 
though the column, will be ionized to H 2AsO4–
 due to 
elevated pH value s in the column caused by the buffer 
capacity of acetate ex changed from the resin.) The elu -
ate from the column was collected in another 125 -mL 
bottle (iden tified as bot tle C). Samples in bottles A, B, 
and C were analyzed for total arsenic using ICP -MS. 
As(III) con centration made up the total arsenic con cen-
tration of the resin -treated sample in bottle C. The As(V) 
concentration was cal culated by subtracting As(III) from 
the total soluble arsenic con centration of the sam ple in 
bottle B. Arsenic speciation kits were prepared in batch at Battelle 
based on a method modified from Edwards et al. (1998). 
Each arsenic speciation kit contained the following:  
 
• One anion exchange resin column  
• Primary and duplicate A, B, and C bottles  
• One 400-mL disposab le beaker 
• Two 60-mL disposable syringes  
• Several 0.45 -µm syringe -adapted disc filters.  
 
Each speciation kit was packed in a plastic zip lock bag 
along with latex gloves and a step -by-step speciation 
sampling instruction sheet. All chemicals used for pre -
paring the kits were of analytical grade or higher. The 
arsenic speciation kits were prepared according to the 
following procedures:  
 
• Resin Preparation.  Before packing into columns, 
the anion exchange resin (Dowex 1 -X8, 50-100 
mesh) was converted from the chloride form (as 
supplied by Supelco) to the acetate form accord ing 
to the method used by Edwards et al. (1998). First, 
1 kg of the resin was placed in a 3 -L beaker. One 
liter of 1N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) then was 
added to the resin, stirred for an hour  using an 
overhead stirrer, and drained. This NaOH rinse 
was repeated sequentially for three times. The 
NaOH-treated resin was then rinsed with two 1 -L 
batches of reagent grade water, followed by three 
acetic acid rinses. Each acetic acid rinse consisted 
of adding 1  L of 1N reagent grade acetic acid to 
the resin, stirring for 5  minutes, and drain ing the 
spent acid. The acetic acid -treated resin was 
subsequently rinsed with 3 -L batches of reagent -
grade water. The resin slurry was stored in a 2 -L 
bottle and kept moist until use.  
• Anion Exchange Column Preparation.  The resin 
columns used were 12 cm × 15 mm in size and 
made of polypropylene (Bio -Rad Labora tories, 
CA). Each column was slurry packed with about 
20 g (drained weight) of the prepared resin, 
yielding a resin depth of approximately 10.5 cm. 
The column was sealed with two plastic caps (one 
each on top and bottom) to prevent contamination 
and retain moisture prior to use.  
• Sample Bottles.   VWRbrandTM
 TraceCleanTM
 high-
density polyethylene (HDPE) sample b ottles (250 
and 125 mL) were used to prepare bottles A, B, 
and C. Bottles A and C were spiked with 500 and 
250 µL, respectively, of concentrated ultra -pure 
HNO3; and bottle B was spiked with 1.25 mL of 5% 
(volume/volume) ultra -pure sulfuric acid (H 2SO4). 
H2SO4 was used to acidify the sample in bottle B 
because Cl–
 in HCl could interfere with the ICP -MS 
arsenic detection and HNO 3 (an oxidizing agent)  
 8 could damage the resin or form nitric acid -arsenic 
redox couples (Edwards et al., 1998).  
• Beaker, Syringes, a nd Filters.   One 400 -mL 
disposable plastic beaker was used to collect a 
water sample. Samples were filtered using 60 -mL 
disposable plastic syringes with 0.45 -µm screw -on 
disc filters. All disposable beakers, syringes, and 
filters were rinsed with distilled  (DI) water and air -
dried before being packed into the sampling kits.  
3.2.2  Preparation of Recycle Backwash 
Water/Supernatant Discharge 
Sampling  Kits 
The recycle backwash water/supernatant discharge sam -
ples were collected for pH, total and soluble As, A l, Fe, 
and Mn measurements. Each sampling kit contained the 
following items:  
 
• Primary and duplicate A and B bottles (both 
preserved with HNO 3) to contain unfiltered and 
filtered samples for total and soluble As, Al, Fe, 
and Mn analyses  • One 400-mL disposabl e beaker 
• Two 60-mL disposable syringes  
• Several 0.45 -µm screw -on disc filters  
• Bottles provided by Wilson Environmental 
Laboratories used for pH analyses.  
The sampling kit was prepared in a similar way as the ar -
senic speciation kit except that bottle B was  preserved 
with HNO 3 instead of H 2SO4. The sampling kit was packed  
in a plastic zip lock bag along with latex gloves and a 
step-by-step sampling instruction sheet.  
 
3.2.3  Preparation of Sample Coolers  
Sample containers for analysis of all water quality pa ram-
eters except for total As, Al, Fe, and Mn were pro vided by 
Wilson Environmental Laboratories. These con tainers 
were new, rinsed with DI water, allowed to air dry, and 
contained appropriate preservatives before be ing deliv-
ered to Battelle. These bottles were labeled with the letter 
D, E, F, or G, designating the specific analysis to be per -
formed. Table 3 -1 lists the sample con tainer size and type

containers were labeled prior to shipment.  
 
Figure 3-1 presents an example sample bottle label. The 
sample identification (ID) consisted of five parts, includ -
ing a two -letter code for a water treatment plant, the 
sampling date (m m/dd/yy), a two - letter code for a spe -
cific sampling location (e.g., IN for inlet water, PF for 
before the filtration process, and AF for after the fil tration 
process or at the plant outlet), a one -letter code desig -
nating the analyses to be performed ( see Table 3 -1), 
and a code indicating whether the sample is a primary 
sample or a field duplicate sample. A field duplicate was 
identified by adding a “dup” to the label and a primary 
sample used no additional coding.  
 
 
 
Figure 3-1.  Example of Sample Bott le Label 
 
 
After the sample bottles were labeled, they were placed 
in coolers subdivided into three compartments, each cor -
responding to a specific sampling location at each plant. 
Color coding was used to identify sampling loca tions and 
all associated  sample bottles. For example, red, blue, 
and yellow were used to designate sample lo cations for 
raw water at the plant inlet, before the fil tration process, 
and after the filtration process (or at the plant outlet), 
respectively. Other sampling and sh ipping-related mater i-
als, including latex gloves, chain -of-custody forms, pre -
paid Federal Express air bills, sam pling instructions, ice 
packs, and bubble wrap, also were packed into cool ers. 
When arsenic speciation or recycle supernatant/super -
natant discharge sam ples were to be col lected, arsenic 
speciation kits or recycle super natant/super natant dis -
charge sam pling kits also were in cluded in the cooler. 
After prep aration, sample coolers were sent to all plants 
every Thurs day via Fed eral Express for the following 
week’s sam pling activity. Fig ure 3-2 shows photographs 
of a sample cooler with three sample compartments and a 
color-coded instruction sheet placed under the lid of the 
cooler. 3.3  Sampling Procedures  
3.3.1  General App roach and Sampling 
Schedules  
Two Battelle staff members traveled to each plant to col -
lect source water samples, meet plant operators, solicit 
interest in participating in this year -long sampling pro -
gram, and obtain plant design and operating infor mation 
and historical water quality data. After the plant selec tion, 
one Battelle staff member returned to each plant to collect 
samples at selected sampling loca tions and train the plant 
operator or a designated POC to per form sam pling and 
field arsenic s peciation. The re maining three pre liminary 
sampling events and long -term sampling events then 
were conducted by the trained plant per sonnel. Residuals 
sampling, including a single sludge sam pling event (Plant 
A only) and the monthly collection of re cycle supernatant 
or supernatant dis charge, also were collected by the 
designated plant employ ees with de tailed instructions  
provided by Battelle over the tele phone. Table 3 -2 sum-
marizes the sampling activities at both plants.  
 
During the prelimina ry and long -term sampling, sample  
collection was conducted on a four -week cycle, with each  
week having unique sampling requirements. Table 3 -3 
summarizes the schedules for the initial source water, 
the preliminary, the long -term, and the sludge sampling 
at both plants.  
 
After receipt of the weekly sample coolers, plant per sonnel 
began sampling activities at the selected locations on the  
scheduled dates. Upon completion, all sample bot tles were 
placed in the same cool ers for return shipment to Battelle  
by Federal Express. Upon receipt of the sam ples, the des -
ignated Battelle sam ple custodian imme diately exam ined 
and compared the condi tions of all sam ple bottles with 
those indicated on the chain -of-custody forms. Sam ples 
then were distributed  to Battelle’s ICP -MS laboratory and 
Wilson Environ mental Labora tories for chemical analyses.  
 
Throughout the duration of the study, Battelle staff main -
tained frequent telephone contact with each plant to 
ensure that all sampling activities were carr ied out as 
planned. For example, after scheduled arrival of sample 
coolers, one Battelle staff member would call to confirm 
the receipt of the coolers, answer any questions, discuss 
irregular plant operations and unusual observations, and 
propose/suggest corrective actions. When available, re -
sults of the chemical analyses also were discussed over 
the telephone and data sheets were sent quarterly to the 
plants for review. Further, plant operational and water 
quality data (such as plant flowrate, chlorine  addition 
rate, and tur bidity) were sent along with sample cool ers 
or transmitted via fac simile to Battelle for infor mation/ 
evaluation.

3.3.2  Arsenic Field Speciation Procedure  
The procedures for performing field arsenic speciation are  
shown in Figure 3 -3 and are described as follows (“steps” 
refer to Figure 3 -3): 
 
• Bottle A: A 400-mL disposable plastic beaker was 
rinsed thorough ly with the water to be sam pled. 
The beaker then was used to collect a water sam -
ple and to fill bottle A with an aliquot of that sample (step 3). If necessary, additional sample water was 
added to the beaker after bottle A was filled to 
complete arsenic speciation sampling.  
• Bottle B: A 60-mL disposable plastic syringe was 
rinsed thoroughly with the water in the plastic 
beaker by completely filling and emptying the 
syringe (step 4). After attaching a 0.45 -µm disc 
filter and wasting about 10 drops of the fi ltrate, the 
syringe was used to filter the water sample from   
 11

Coded Instruction Sheet  
 
 
the beaker and fill bottle B. Bottle B then was 
tightly capped a nd vigorously shaken for about 
15 seconds to allow thorough mixing of the filtered 
water and sulfuric acid (step 5).  
• Bottle C: The protective caps on the top and 
bottom of a resin column were removed and 
approximately 40 mL of the water in bottle B was 
wasted through the column. This initial 40  mL was 
used to displace the water in the resin column and to ensure attainability of a representative sample 
from the column. The resin column then was posi -
tioned over bottle C, and the water from bottle  B 
was passe d through the column until approxi -
mately 20 mL of the resin -treated sample had 
been collected in bottle C (step 6).  
The procedure as described under the above three bul -
lets was repeated to obtain duplicate bottles A, B, and C.

tion signed on a chain -of-custody form (step  7). All sam -
ple bottles (for arsenic speciation and other water quality 
parameters), along with the signed chain -of-custody form,  
were placed in the original cooler with ice packs and 
shipped via Federal Express to Battelle (step 8).

Discharge Sampling Procedure  
Figure 3-4 shows an instruction sheet for performing re -
cycle supernatan t and super natant discharge sam pling. 
Because both total and dissolved As, Al, Fe, and Mn 
were analyzed, the pro cedure for recycle super natant/ 
supernatant discharge sampling was sim ilar to that for 
arsenic speciation, except that the steps for col lecting 
samples in bottle C were omitted.  
 
3.3.4  Sampling Procedure for Other Water 
Quality Parameters  
All other water quality parameters identified in Table 3 -3, 
were analyzed using samples either in bottles A, B, and 
C or in bottles provided by Wilson E nvironmental Labor-
atories (i.e., bottles D, E, F, and G). All bottles D, E, F, 
and G were filled directly from sample taps and pre -
served according to the respective analytical meth ods. 
These sample bottles along with bottles A, B, and C 
were placed i n the original coolers with ice packs and 
shipped via Federal Express to Battelle.  
 
3.4  Analytical Procedures  
The analytical procedures used for this project were de -
scribed in Section 4.0 of the QAPP prepared by Battelle (1998). Table 3 -4 presents a summ ary of all ana lytical 
methods used. All of the methods used are stand ard 
EPA methods. Analyses of As, Al, Fe, and Mn in water 
samples were accomplished by ICP -MS using EPA 
Method 200.8. ICP -MS was chosen as the method for 
As, Al, Fe, and Mn analyses beca use it had a low meth -
od detection limit (MDL) and was a relatively low -cost 
method (about $35/sample). ICP -MS analyses were con-
ducted on a Perkin Elmer Sciex Model 6000 equipped 
with a crossflow pneumatic nebulizer and an auto matic 
sampler. Yttrium (88.9
Y) was added to all sam ples as an 
internal standard to correct for instrument drift. Because 
arsenic is monoisotopic, all measure ments were made at 
a mass/charge ratio of 75. To elim inate an appreciable 
interference from a chloride molecular spe cies (40
Ar35
Cl), 
all ion current data at m/e 75 were cor rected using chlo -
ride measurements in all samples, and the MDL was 
0.1 µg/L As. All the unfiltered  water sam ples (i.e., in bot -
tle A) were digested using EPA Method 200.8 prior to 
analysis. Filtered w ater samples (i.e., in bottles B and C) 
were analyzed directly without diges tion. Wilson Envi ron-
mental Laboratories in West erville, OH was sub contracted 
to perform all other chem ical analyses. QA/QC of all  
methods followed the guide lines provide d in the QAPP 
(Battelle, 1998), and the data qual ity in terms of pre cision, 
accuracy, MDL, and com pleteness is dis cussed in Sec-
tion 5.0 of this report.  
 
It should be noted that turbidity tests were not run on site. 
Relatively high levels of reduced ir on in raw water sam -
ples may have oxidized during transportation of sam ples 
to the analytical laboratory, resulting in elevated tur bidity 
readings. The turbidity might have been much lower if 
readings had been taken on site.

 164.0  Results and Discussion  
This section presents the results of the treatment plant 
selection process, which resulted in the selection of two 
iron removal plants, referred to as Plants A and B. In 
addition, results from water and residuals sampling and 
analysis at each plant are summarized and dis cussed. 
Complete analytical results from long -term water sam -
pling at Plants A and B are presented in Appendices A 
and B, respectively.  
 
4.1  Plant Selection  
The plant selection process consisted of identifying  po-
tential treatment facilities, contacting these facilities via 
telephone, and conducting initial site visits during which 
source water sample s were collected and ana lyzed. Ini-
tially, a list was prepared consisting of eight  potential iron 
removal treatment facilities. These candi date facil ities 
were contacted to discuss the study and determine de -
tails of plant operation. Each facility was e valuated and 
assigned an overall plant rating based on the follow ing cri-
teria: source water arsenic concen trations, source water 
type, availability of man power to conduct study, avail -
ability of historical data, and plant size. Selection was 
based prim arily on source water arsenic concen trations, 
and preference was given to facilities with arsenic con -
centrations greater than 20  µg/L. Another major con -
sideration was the avail ability of manpower, because the 
long-term study would re quire significant  resources. Also,  
it was desir able to have historical arsenic analytical data, 
fairly large facil ities (i.e., >20,000 people served), and a 
mix of plants using ground water and/or sur face water 
sources. 
 From the eight initial plants, two iron removal p lants 
were selected for site visits and source water sampling 
(see Table 4 -1). The same plants that were selected for 
the initial site visits also were selected for the sub -
sequent phases of the study. Results from sampling at 
both facilities during each p hase of the study are pre -
sented in the sections that follow.  
 
4.2  Plant A  
Water and residual samples were collected and ana lyzed 
at Plant A during three phases of the study. The first 
phase consisted of source water sampling, which was  
used to help dete rmine if the plant should be con sidered 
for further evaluation. Source water sam pling at Plant A 
was performed in February 1998. Fol lowing source water 
sampling, the second phase of the study was initiated. 
This second phase consisted of weekly water sampling 
for a four -week period in April and May 1998 and was 
designed to determine if the sampling lo cations and pro -
posed water quality analy ses were ap propriate for the  
third phase, long -term eval uation. The third phase was 
initiated in June 1998 and continued through June 1999. 
This long-term eval uation consisted of weekly sampling 
and analy sis of pro cess water at four locations through -
out the treat ment process. Also, arse nic specia tion sam-
pling was con ducted every fourth week. The th ird phase 
of the study also included residual sample col lection and 
analysis. Supernatant dis charge sam ples from the set -
tling pond were col lected monthly begin ning in No vember 
1998, and three sludge samples were collected dur ing a 
single sampl ing event from the set tling pond.

 174.2.1  Plant A Description  
Plant A is one of th ree plants that provides water to a 
city with a population of approximately 15,000 (approx i-
mately 6,000 connections). Plant A was built in 1970 and 
treats ground water using an iron removal process fol -
lowed by zeolite soft ening. The plant is capable o f treat-
ing 1.6 million gallons per day (mgd). A sche matic diagram 
of the Plant  A treatment process is shown in Figure 4 -1. 
 
The treatment process consists of the following major 
elements:  
 
• Aeration.  Aeration is used to oxidize iron and 
manganese as we ll as remove H 2S, NH3, SO2, and 
CH4. 
• Chlorination .  Approximately 5 mg/L total chlorine 
(1.5-2 mg/L free chlorine) is added to oxidize 
remaining iron and manganese and to disinfect 
filters and softeners.  
• Sedimentation.   Sedimentation occurs in a baffled 
basin with approximately 20 minutes retention 
time. After sedimentation, potassium perman -
ganate (KMnO 4) is added to remove manganese, 
taste, and odor as well as to continuously regen -
erate the manganese greensand in the filter.  
• Filtration .  The filtering me dia consists of 
manganese greensand (top) and graded gravel 
(bottom). A water backwash occurs every 20  hours 
and an air backwash occurs every 72  hours. 
• Softening .  Approximately two thirds of the filtered 
water is sent through a zeolite resin softener (ion  
exchange) to reduce hard ness. Regeneration 
occurs every 175,000  gal processed with 27% 
solution of NaCl. The regeneration takes approxi -
mately 1 hour and consists of a 12 -minute back -
wash, 20-minute brine rinse, and a slow/fast rinse 
cycle. 
• Postchlorinat ion.  Approximately 5 to 6 mg/L of 
total chlorine (<1 mg/L free chlorine) is added for 
distribution residual. Also, 0.9 to 1.2  mg/L of 
fluoride (H 2SiF6) is added. No ammonia is added 
because the water contains NH 3 and about 0.8 to 
1.0 mg/L of residual chlo ramines is maintained in 
the finished water.  
• Backwash.  Backwash water and regenerant 
waste is sent to an out door settling pond and 
supernatant is dis charged to the sanitary sewer. 
Sludge is sent to waste water plant drying beds and 
then to local farm fi elds. No arsenic sam pling on 
sludge had been conducted prior to this study.  4.2.2  Initial Source Water Sampling  
Plant A obtains source water from three ground water 
wells (Wells 5, 6, and 7). Each well is approximately 
275 ft deep. An initial site visit to Plant A was con ducted 
February 10, 1998 during which time source water sam -
ples were collected from the intake, which repre sents a 
combined sample from ground water Wells 5, 6, and 7.  
 
The total arsenic concentration during the initial sam -
pling event  was 23.5 µg/L. Particulate arsenic ac counted 
for 1.7 µg/L of the total arsenic concen tration, and solu -
ble arsenic accounted for the remain ing 21.8 µg/L. Field 
arsenic speciation sam pling indicated that the soluble 
arsenic consisted of 20.1  µg/L of As (III) and 1.7 µg/L of 
As(V), which was con sistent with what would be ex -
pected for a ground water source. Also, as would be 
expected at an iron removal plant, the total iron con cen-
tration was relatively high, 2,700 µg/L. Table 4 -2 presents 
the complet e analytical results from the initial source 
water sampling event.  
 
Due primarily to the relatively high source water arse nic 
concentrations and the availability of plant per sonnel to 
perform preliminary and long -term sampling, Plant A was 
selected for  incorporation into the pre liminary and long -
term evaluation phases of this project.  
 
4.2.3  Preliminary Sampling  
During the preliminary sampling phase of this study, 
water samples were collected at four locations within the 
treatment plant: inlet (IN), before filtration (PF), after fil -
tration (AF), and after soften ing (AS). The IN sam ples 
were collected from a tap located prior to treat ment and 
represents combined water from Wells 5, 6, and 7. The 
PF samples were collected after the water had under -
gone aeration, chlorination, and sedi mentation. 
 
After filtration and prior to zeolite soften ing, the AF sam -
ples were collected. Finally, the AS sam ples were col -
lected after softening and prior to final chlo rination and 
H2SiF6 addition. Figure 4 -2 is a process flowchart for 
Plant A that shows sampling loca tions within the treat -
ment process and the asso ciated sample analy ses per-
formed at each location.  
 
Alkalinity, pH, total iron, total manganese, and total ar -
senic analyses were performed on s amples col lected at 
each of the four sampling locations each week. Turbidity, 
hardness, and arsenic speciation analy ses were con -
ducted once during the preliminary study on samples 
collected at each sampling location. Soluble and par ticu-
late arsenic  were determined as part of the arsenic

speciation, as well as the species (arsenite and arse -
nate) making up the soluble fraction of the total arsenic 
concentration. Table 4 -3 presents the re sults from the 
four-week preliminary sampling period . 
 
Results from the preliminary sampling events indi cated 
that inlet total arsenic concentrations ranged from ap -
proximately 23.7 to 18.6 µg/L. Consistent with the ini tial 
source water sampling, the source water con tained 
primarily As(III) and minor co ncentrations of As(V) and 
particulate arsenic. As would be expected following chlo -
rination and sedimentation, As(III) had been almost com -
pletely oxi dized to As(V) at the PF sam pling loca tion. It 
appeared that, after the As(III) had been oxi dized to 
As(V), it copre cipitated with the oxi dized iron. There fore, 
at the PF sampling location, arsenic was pres ent pri-
marily as particulate. The ma jority of the arse nic removal 
occurred during filtra tion. No sig nificant remov al occurred  
during sedimentation or softening.  
 
The average total arsenic removal by Plant A was ap prox-
imately 91% during the preliminary sampling, re ducing the 
finished water total arsenic concentration to between 3.4 
and 0.6 µg/L. McNeill and Edwards (1997) developed the 
following simplified model for pre dicting arsenic removal 
during metal hydroxide pre cipitation based on raw water 
Fe and Al concen trations: 
 
 []
[] ( )mM AlFeK1mM AlFeK100(%) Sorbed Arsenic+×++××=  (1) 
 
where K = 78 mM−1
. 
 This model was based on data collected at more than  14 
full-scale facilities, and was able to accurately pre dict 
arsenic removal within ±13% (90th percentile con fidence 
interval). Applying this model to the pre liminary results 
from Plant A, the predicted removal ranged from 77% to 
79% compared to act ual removal rate rang ing from 84% 
to 97%. The maximum dif ference between the actual 
and predicted arsenic removal effi ciencies was 10%. It 
should be noted that the cal culation did not incorporate 
aluminum concentra tions because they were not ob -
tained during the prelimi nary sampling phase. Never the-
less, the simplified model ap peared to approxi mate the 
arsenic removal at Plant  A fairly well, and was used to 
evaluate long -term system perform ance. 
 
Other water quality parameters were analyzed to su pport 
understanding of mechanisms of arsenic removal. Dur -
ing prelim inary sampling, pH was relatively con stant, at 
approximately 7.7 throughout the treat ment process. This 
pH is in the range where no effect on arsenic removal 
efficiency using iron hy droxide pre cipitation has been ob -
served in previous studies (Sorg and Logsdon, 1978; 
Sorg, 1993; Hering et al., 1996).  
 
Oxidation of Fe(II) by chlorine may be described by the 
following chemical reaction:  
 
 2Fe2+
 + Cl2 + 6H2O ⇔ 2Fe(OH)3(s) + 2Cl− + 6H+
 (2) 
 
The slight decrease in alkalinity observed after oxi dation of 
the iron (i.e., at the PF sampling location) is a result of stoi -
chiometry of iron oxidation in which pro tons are pro duced 
and alkalinity is destroyed (Benefield and Morgan, 1990).

 22The source water at Plant A would be classified as hard 
to very hard and the zeolite softening process effec tively 
reduced hardness from approximately  304 mg/L (as 
CaCO3) to 11 mg/L (as CaCO 3). As stated pre viously, 
approximately two -thirds of the water pro cessed at Plant 
A is treated using zeolite softening. Turbidity also was 
effectively removed at Plant A with concen trations de -
creasing from appr oximately 23 NTU to 5.2 NTU fol low-
ing aeration, chlorination, and sedi mentation. Rela tively 
high turbidity concentrations at the inlet may be a result 
of iron oxidation after the sam ple was collected and prior 
to analysis. After fil tration the tur bidity decreased to  ap-
proximately 0.3 NTU. Total manganese con centrations 
were relatively constant throughout the treatment pro cess 
with concentrations ranging between 60 and <20  µg/L. 
Total iron con centrations ranged from 2,390 to 2,635 µg/ L 
in the source water and <30 to 50  µg/L in the fin ished 
water. Total iron concentrations were rela tively con stant 
between the plant inlet and prior to filtration, with  signifi-
cant iron removal occurring as a result of filtra tion. It 
appears that t he primary arsenic removal mech anism at 
Plant A is adsorption and copre cipitation of As(V) with 
the iron hydroxide precipitates.  
 
Based on the results of the preliminary sampling effort, 
only minor changes were made to the approach for the 
long-term evaluation. Sampling locations and primary 
analytes remained unchanged, except for the addition of 
aluminum. The iron and manganese analy sis was modi -
fied to achieve lower detection limits by using ICP -MS. 
Also, it was determined that part of the sam ple in bot-
tle B from the arsenic speci ation kits would be used to 
determined dissolved alum inum, iron, and manganese 
concentrations.  
 4.2.4  Long -Term Sampling  
Long-term sampling and analysis consisted of 49 weeks 
of sampling with 12 arsenic speciation sa mpling events. 
During the long -term sampling phase of this study, water 
samples were collected at the same four locations that 
were used during the preliminary sam pling phase. Alka -
linity, pH, total arsenic, total alum inum, total iron, and 
total mangan ese analyses were performed on sam pled 
collected each week. Arsenic spe ciation sampling was 
conducted 12 times during the long -term sampling phase 
on samples col lected from each sampling loca tion. Dis-
solved alum inum, iron, and manganese con centrations 
at each sam pling location were deter mined monthly 
using a sample from bottle B of the arsenic speci ation 
kits. Additionally, resid ual sampling was per formed dur -
ing this phase and con sisted of collec tion and analysis of 
supernatant dis charge an d sludge from the settling pond.

 23PF sampling loca tion ranged from 3.8 µg/L to 23.8 µg/L, 
with an aver age of 19.3 µg/L. It should be noted that only 
three sampling events pro duced approximately 3 to 6  µg/L 
of arsenic at the P F location. Therefore, only minor  arse-
nic removal occurred during the sedimenta tion process. 
Samples collected after filtration con tained total arse nic 
concentrations ranging from 1.0 µg/L to 8.0 µg/L, with an 
average of 3.1 µg/L; and total arsenic concen trations aver -
aged 2.8 µg/L in samples collected after the zeolite soft -
ening process. The data indicate that the ma jority of the 
arsenic removal occurred in the filters.  
 
The average removal percentage of total arsenic be tween 
the IN and AF sampling locations was 85% and between 
the IN and AS locations was 87%. These data indicate 
that the vast major ity of the arsenic was re moved during 
filtration and that the softening pro cess did little to improve 
removal efficiency. The aver age arsenic removal pre -
dicted by McNeill and Edwards (1997) sorp tion model was 
76%, which is with in the 90th percentile confidence inter -
val of the model. Fig ure 4-3 is a graph showing the total 
arsenic concen tration recorded at each sam pling location 
throughout the study, as well as the removal per centage 
calculated for each sampling event. As shown in this fig -
ure, total arsenic concen trations at the IN and AF sam -
pling locations remain rela tively con stant through out the 
 study with no seas onal effects noted. The three dips in  
the arsenic con centrations at the PF sampling loca tion 
may have been a result of re duced pro cess flow occurring 
during the win ter months, result ing in longer retention  
times in the sedi mentation basins.  
 
Particulate arsenic concentrations averaged 1.8 µg/L at 
the inlet, 14.3 µg/L before filtration, 0.8 µg/L after filtra -
tion, and <0.1 after softening. The increase in par ticulate 
arsenic at the PF sampling location was due to sorp tion 
and coprecip itation of arsenic on/with iron hydrox ide pre-
cipitates. This observation was sup ported by the de -
crease of par ticulate arsenic in the AF sam pling location.  
 
As(III) and As(V) make up the soluble portion of the total 
arsenic concentration. The average As(III) and  As(V) con -
centrations in the source water were 16.0 and 4.3  µg/L, 
respectively. The As(III) was oxidized to As(V) by chlo -
rination prior to the PF sam pling location and the As(V) 
was sorbed to and copre cipitated with the iron hydrox ide. 
Therefore, the  majority of the total arsenic in the water 
prior to filtration was in particulate form (i.e., attached to 
the iron). Aver age As(III) con centrations re mained low 
and relatively constant fol lowing oxidation and the aver -
age As(V) concen trations decreased slightly from 4.3  µg/L 
in the source water to 3.1 µg/L after soft ening.

 24Figure 4-4 shows As(III), As(V), and par ticulate arseni c 
concentrations mea sured during the long -term evalu -
ation. 
 
Plant A water treatment system was able to con sistently 
remove arsenic to low levels (i.e., average treated water 
total arsenic concentration was 2.8 µg/L). The primary 
arsenic removal mech anism ap pears to be copre cipi-
tation with iron hydroxide precip itates followed by filtra -
tion. The simplified sorption model devel oped by McNeill 
and Edwards (1997) ap pears to approximate the arsenic 
removal process at Plant A reasonably well, alt hough the 
model consist ently under estimated the re moval by ap -
proximately 11%.  
 
4.2.4.2  Other Water Quality Parameters  
In addition to arsenic analysis, other water quality param -
eters were analyzed to provide insight into the chem ical 
processes oc curring at the treatment facility. Table 4 -5 
summarizes the analytical results for several water qual -
ity parameters obtained during the long -term sampling at 
Plant A. 
 
Alkalinity concentrations were relatively constant rang ing 
between 347 mg/L and 415 mg /L (as CaCO 3) in the 
source water, with an average of 413 mg/L. As ob served 
during the preliminary sampling, a slight de crease in 
average alkalinity to 398 mg/L was ob served after oxi -
dation of the iron due to the stoi chiometry of iron oxi da-
tion process. Turbidity con centrations ranged from 13.8 
NTU to 26 NTU, with an average of 19 NTU. Increased 
turbidity concentrations may have resulted from oxida tion 
of iron occurring after the sam ple was collected and prior 
to analysis at the labora tory. The bulk of the tur bidity was 
removed during sedi mentation, reduc ing concentrations 
to an average of 5.1 NTU. The system effectively re -
moved turbidity with an aver age finished water concen -
tration of 0.1 NTU. Fig ure 4-5 plots inlet alkalinity,  pH, 
and hardness concen trations observed  throughout the 
duration of the study.  
 
The pH was constant, averaging 7.6 or 7.7 at each sam -
pling location within the treatment process. This pH is in 
the range (pH 5.5 to 8.5) where arsenic remov al 
efficiency by i ron oxides is not affected (Sorg and 
Longsdon, 1978; Sorg, 1993; Hering et al., 1996). Total 
hardness concentrations ranged from 286 mg/L to 
432 mg/L (as CaCO 3) in the plant source water, with an 
average of 316 mg/L. These concen trations were rela -
tively constant with the exception of the sample col lected 
on September 30, 1998. Similar to alkalinity, a slight 
decrease in hardness was ob served following oxidation of 
iron, resulting in an aver age hardness con centration of 
291 mg/L. As would be expected , considerable re moval 
of hardness was observed fol lowing zeolite softening, reducing total hardness to an average of 5.2  mg/L (as 
CaCO3). 
 
Total iron concentrations at the inlet sampling location 
ranged from 762 µg/L to 3,289 µg/L and averaged 2,284 
µg/L. At the PF sampling location, total iron con centra-
tions ranged from 267 µg/L to 3,026 µg/L and aver aged 
2,241 µg/L. Therefore, the total iron con centrations were 
relatively constant be tween the source and just prior to 
the filters. However, diss olved iron analyt ical results 
show that approxi mately half of the iron entering the 
plant was in the reduced form. The average dis solved 
iron concentration in source water was 953 µg/L. After 
aeration and chlorination, prac tically all iron was oxi dized 
with concentrations of <30  µg/L at all other sam pling 
locations throughout the study. The filtration pro cess 
removed most of the iron, reducing average total iron 
concentrations to 71.5  µg/L. The zeolite soft ener filtered 
additional iron par ticles and the average total iron con -
centration after the soft ening pro cess was <30  µg/L. As 
stated previ ously, iron is the key factor in arsenic 
removal at Plant A. It is believed that the majority of the 
arsenic removal is through adsorp tion and copre cipita-
tion of As(V) with iron hydroxides.  
 
Total aluminum concentrations averaged 17.9 µg/L at 
the inlet and <11 µg/L at the other three sampling loca -
tions. Concentrations of dissolved aluminum aver aged 
20.4 µg/L in the source water and <11 µg/L at th e other 
three sampling locations. It did not appear that co -
precipitation with aluminum hydroxide was a sig nificant 
factor in the removal of arsenic, because only minor con -
centrations were present.  
 
Total and dissolved manganese concentrations were rel -
atively low. Total manganese concentrations aver aged 
22.2 µg/L in the source water, 42.4 µg/L prior to filtration, 
22.7 µg/L after filtration, and 5.1 µg/L after softening. 
The increase in manganese prior to filtration is most 
likely due to the addition o f KMnO4 for the green sand fil-
ters. Aver age dissolved manganese con centrations were 
21.0 µg/L in the source water, 17.5  µg/L prior to fil tration, 
9.0 µg/L after filtration, and 2.5 µg/L after softening.  
 
4.2.4.3  Supernatant Discharge  
Backwash wate r is generated from backwashing the 
filtration units every 24 hours and from backwashing the 
zeolite resin softeners after every 275,000 gallons pro -
cessed. All backwash water and regenerant waste at 
Plant A is sent to an outdoor settling pond and super -
natant from the pond is discharged continuously to the 
sanitary sewer. Supernatant dis charge samples were 
collected at the outfall of the settling pond into the sani -
tary sewer. Results of the supernatant dis charge sam -
pling are summarized in Table 4 -6.

The total arsenic concentrations in the supernatant dis -
charge ranged from 9.4 µg/L to 167.0 µg/L, with an aver -
age of 72.4 µg/L. Approximately 40% of the tota l arsenic 
concentration was soluble and 60% was par ticulate. As 
expected, the average iron con centration in the super -
natant water was relatively high at 5,780 µg/L. Practically 
all of the iron is in the oxidized form. The particulate 
arsenic is most lik ely sorbed to un settled iron solids.  
 
4.2.4.4  Sludge  
Sludge is generated from cleaning sedi mentation basins 
and from backwashing the greensand filters and zeolite resin softeners. The sedimentation basins are cleaned 
out once per year, and the waste water and sludge are 
sent directly to the sanitary sewer. A water backwash is 
performed on the green sand filters every 24 hours and 
an air backwash is per formed every 72 hours. Regen er-
ation of the zeolite soft eners occurs after every 275,000 
gallons pr ocessed, and involves using a 27% solution of 
NaCl. The regenera tion takes about 1  hour to complete, 
and consists of a 12 -minute back wash, a 20 -minute brine  
rinse, and slow/fast rinse cycle.  
 
The backwash water and regenerant waste are sent to 
an outdoo r settling pond. Historically, the retention pond

was drained and the sludge removed once per year. 
Sludge then was trans ferred to the municipal w astewater 
treatment plant and placed on the waste water plant 
drying beds. After dry ing, the sludge would be placed on 
local farm fields.  
 
During the long -term evaluation phase of this pro ject, 
sludge samples were collected from three loca tions 
within the sludge settling pond at Plant A. These sludge 
samples were analyzed for pH, percent mois ture, total 
arsenic, total aluminum, total manga nese, and total iron. Also, a TCLP test was performed on each sample to 
determine the quantities of leachable ars enic, barium, 
cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and sil -
ver. Total arsenic concentrations ranged from 255 mg/kg 
to 392 mg/kg, and total iron ranged from 78,600 mg/kg 
to 93,000 mg/kg. Arsenic was de tected at less than 
0.05 mg/L in the TCLP extra ction procedure. Also, con -
centrations were below the more stringent regula tory 
levels in California for total arsenic. Table 4 -7 presents 
the results of sludge analysis at each of the three sam -
pling locations.

4.3  Plant B  
Source water sampling at Plant B was performed in Feb -
ruary 1998. Preliminary sam pling consisted of week ly 
water sampling for a four -week period in May 1998. 
Long-term sampling was initiated in June 1998 and con -
tinued through December 1998. Arsenic speci ation sam -
pling was conducted every fourth week. The third phase 
of this study also included collection and analysis of recy -
cle supernatant during two sampling events in No vember 
1998 and January 1999. No sludge samples were  col-
lected at Plant B.  
 
4.3.1  Plant B Description  
Plant B began operation in the spring of 1993 and pro -
vides a portion of the treated water for approx imately 
6,000 residents and up to 20,000 tourists. The plant 
utilizes an iron removal process for water treatment and 
can process 1.4 mgd. The plant typically operates from 
June through November. Figure 4 -6 is a sche matic dia-
gram of the treatment process at Plant A.  
 
The treatment process at Plant B consists of the fo llow-
ing major elements:  
 
• Intake.  The plant intake consists of water from a 
mining tunnel and recycle supernatant from 
backwashing activities.  
• Chlorination.   Approximately 3 mg/L 
(37-40 lb/day) of chlorine is added for iron 
and manganese oxidation.  
• Reaction Vessels.  There are two reaction vessels 
in series and sulfur dioxide (3 -4 lb/day) is added 
after the first reaction vessel based on manu fac-
turers recommendation to reduce polysulfide in the filter media. These reaction vessels are designed 
to handle 4,000 gallons per minute (gpm).  
• Filtration Vessel.   The filtration vessel contains 
five layers of filtering media, including anthracite 
coal. The filtering rate is 10 gpm/ft2
, and the ves sel 
is backwashed every 8 hours or at 10  pounds per 
square inch (ps i) pressure differential.  
• Blending.  Treated water is blended with non -
treated water from another mining tunnel and one 
spring in the finished water wet well. No post -
treatment chlorination is per formed because the 
residual chlorine is 1 to 2  mg/L. 
• Backwash.  Backwash water is sent to a concrete 
vat where the solids are settled out and the super -
natant water is recycled after about 90  minutes of 
settling. This water is sent back to the intake where 
it is blended with the raw water from the mining 
tunnel. The solids settle to the bottom of the 
concrete vat and are then sent to a sludge holding 
tank. This sludge is processed through a filter 
press and then sent to a municipal landfill.  
 
4.3.2  Initial Source Water Sampling  
Source water at Plant B comes from s urface water run off 
transported via a mining tunnel. Following treat ment, this 
source water is blended with several other sources,  
including another mining tunnel, one spring, and three 
deep wells. These other sources do not require treat ment. 
The blended water is chlorinated and distributed.  Based 
on discus sions with plant per sonnel, the water treated at 
Plant B has a turbidity of approximately 4 -14 NTU and is 
supplied at a flow rate of approximately 7.5 cubic feet per 
second (cfs). His torically, a rsenic concen trations in the 
source water have ranged from 40 to 80 µg/L.

 30An initial site visit to Plant B was conducted on Febru ary 
4, 1998, and source water sam ples were collected at that 
time. During th is sampling event, samples were col lected 
and analyzed for arsenic (total, par ticulate, solu ble, 
As[III], and As[V]) and other water qual ity parameters that 
may affect arsenic re moval. Table 4 -8 presents the ana -
lytical results from the source wat er sampling. The total 
arsenic concen trations in the source water averaged 
48.6 µg/L. Particulate arsenic averaged at 35.7 µg/L and 
the soluble arsenic was mostly As(V), measured at  
10.8 µg/L. The average As(III) con centration measured dur -
ing the initial source water sampling event was 2.1  µg/L. 
Also, the inlet iron con centration averaged 890  µg/L, the 
aluminum concentration was less than the detection limit, 
and the average manga nese concentra tion was 50  µg/L. 
 
Alkalinity concentrations av eraged 135 mg/L (as CaCO 3) 
and total hardness concentrations averaged 522.5 mg/L. 
Therefore, the source water was con sidered very hard. 
Turbidity averaged 4.0 NTU and the sul fate concen tra-
tion averaged 420 mg/L. The pH aver aged 7.7, which is 
in the range where no effect on arsenic removal effi cien-
cy using iron hydroxide pre cipitation has been ob served 
in previous studies (Sorg and Logsdon, 1978; Sorg, 1993;  
Hering et al., 1996).  
 
4.3.3  Preliminary Sampling  
Water samples collected during the p reliminary sam pling 
phase of this study were taken at three locations within 
the treatment plant: the inlet to the plant (IN), before the 
filtration process (PF), and after the fil tration process 
(AF). Sample taps were used to col lect samples at each 
location. The IN samples were col lected at the influent of 
the system after the source water was com bined with the recycle supernatant from the con crete vat. The PF 
samples were collected after addi tion of chlorine and 
processing of water through the t wo reaction vessels. AF 
samples were col lected im mediately following filtration 
and repre sent finished water. Figure 4 -7 is a process 
flow diagram for Plant B that shows sampling locations 
used during the pre liminary and long -term sampling, as 
well as the analyses per formed on samples collected 
from each location.  
 
Alkalinity, pH, total iron, total manganese, and total 
arsenic analysis were performed on all water samples 
collected at Plant B. Turbidity and hardness analysis and 
arsenic speciation sampling were conducted at each 
sampling location once during the preliminary study. 
Arsenic form (soluble and particulate) and spe cies (arse -
nate and arsenite) were determined as part of the arse -
nic speciation. Table 4 -9 presents the re sults of the fo ur-
week preliminary sampling period.  
 
Results from the preliminary sampling events indi cated 
that inlet total arsenic concentrations ranged from 34.1 to 
45.7 µg/L. The total arsenic in the source water was pri -
marily particulate and the sol uble fraction of the total 
arsenic was pri marily As(V). The As(III) concentrations 
measured dur ing the pre liminary sampling period was 
relatively low, averaging only 2.6 µg/L. As expected, the 
species of arsenic did not vary significantly during the 
treatment proc ess. The average total arsenic re moved 
was approximately 64% during preliminary sam pling, 
leaving an average of 15.0 µg/L of total arse nic in the fin -
ished water. Arsenic specia tion sampling during the first 
week of the sampling period indi cated that soluble arse -
nic was not removed and that only the arsenic entering 
the treatment plant as par ticulate was removed. Because

 33of this, the simpli fied sorption model proposed by McNeill 
and Edwards (1997) does not apply to the arsenic 
removal results at this plant.  
 
Other water quality parameters also were analyzed to 
support understanding of mechanisms of arsenic re -
moval. Similar to Plant A, alkalinity concentrations and 
pH decreased slightly between the IN and PF sam pling 
locations, due to the stoichiometry of iron oxi dation in 
which hydrogen ions are produced and alka linity is 
destroyed (Benefield and Morgan, 1990). As would be 
expected, alkalinity and pH remained con stant between 
the PF and AF sampling locations. Source water turbidity 
concentrations averaged 3.5 NTU, which was consistent 
with plant data and data obtained dur ing the initial 
source water sampling. Un like Plant A, increased tur -
bidity due to oxidation of iron after sample collection and 
prior to analysis was not an issue at Plant B because the 
iron entered the facil ity in oxidized form. Plant B effec -
tively removed t urbidity with finished water concen -
trations averaging <0.1 NTU. Also, as observed during 
the source water sam pling event, the source water is 
very hard. No removal of hardness by the treatment pro -
cess was observed during the preliminary sam pling. 
 
Total manganese concentrations were relatively low, 
averaging 55 µg/L in the source water, 45 µg/L prior to 
filtration, and <20 after filtration. Total iron concen tra-
tions averaged 825 µg/L in the source water, 884 µg/L 
prior to filtration, and 75 µg/L aft er filtration. The inlet iron 
concentrations were consistent with those observed dur -
ing the initial source water sam pling event. It ap peared 
that arsenic removal was pri marily achieved through 
filtration of iron particles to which arsenic was sorbed 
prior to treatment at Plant B.  
 
Only minor changes were made to the approach for the 
long-term evaluation as a result of the preliminary sam -pling effort. As with Plant A, sampling locations and 
primary analytes remained unchanged, except for the 
addition o f aluminum. Iron and manganese analy sis 
were modified to achieve lower detection limits by using 
ICP-MS. Also, it was determined that part of the sample 
in bottle B from the arsenic speciation kits would be used 
to determined dissolved aluminum, iron, and  manganese 
concentrations.  
 
4.3.4  Long -Term Sampling  
Long-term sampling and analysis consisted of 26 weeks 
of water sampling at the three locations used dur ing the 
preliminary sampling phase. All weekly sam ples were 
analyzed for total arsenic, alka linity, pH, total aluminum, 
total iron, and total man ganese. Tur bidity, hardness, dis -
solved aluminum, dis solved iron, and dissolved manga -
nese analysis, as well as arsenic speciation sam pling 
were conducted at each sampling location a total of 
seven time s during the long -term sam pling phase. Arse -
nic speciation sam pling included the deter mination of 
soluble arsenic, particulate arse nic, As(V), and As(III) 
concentrations. Recycle super natant dis charge analy sis 
was performed twice during this phase.  Sludge samples 
were not col lected at Plant B during this study; however, 
results from sludge sam pling conducted in 1994 are dis -
cussed in Sub section 4.3.4.4. The follow ing subsections 
summarize the ar senic, water quality param eter, and 
residual analytical results.  
 
4.3.4.1  Arsenic  
Table 4-10 provides a summary of the arsenic analyt ical 
results collected at the three sampling locations at Plant 
B. Total arsenic concentrations at the inlet loca tion 
ranged from 33.3 to 97.9 µg/L, with an aver age con-
centration of 48.5 µg/L. Total arsenic con centrations at 
the prefiltration location ranged from 6.7 to 81.1 µg/L

 34with an aver age of 41.8 µg/L. Therefore, very littl e arse-
nic was removed prior to filtration. Sam ples collected at 
the AF location contained total arse nic concentrations 
ranging from 5.3 to 19.7 µg/L, with an average of 11.9 
µg/L. The average removal effi ciency of total arsenic 
(comparing raw wat er to finished water con centrations) 
was 74%. Fig ure 4-8 is a graph showing the arsenic con -
centrations recorded at each sampling location through -
out the study.  
 
Particulate arsenic concentrations averaged 38.9 µg/L at 
the inlet, 40.1 µg/L prior to f iltration, and 1.3 µg/L after 
filtration. These results indicate that very little ad sorption 
and coprecipitation of soluble arsenic occurs during the 
treatment process. Instead, the arsenic most like ly is 
attached to the oxidized iron particles prior to entering 
the facility.  
 
This observation is supported by the As(III) and As(V) 
analytical results. As(III) and As(V) make up the sol uble 
fraction of the total arsenic concentration. As(III) concen -
trations in the source water ranged from 0.1 to 2.2 µg/L , 
with an average of 1.4 µg/L. Some of the As(III) was 
converted to As(V) during chlorination, resulting in aver -
age As(III) concentrations at the prefil tration and after -
filtration sampling locations of 0.5 µg/L and 0.3 µg/L, 
respectively. As(V) concen trations averaged 10.5 µg/L at the inlet, 10.2 µg/L prior to filtration, and 11.1 µg/L in the 
finished water. It is interesting that very little soluble ar -
senic was removed at Plant B. This observation is most 
likely a result of the lack of reduced iron  in the source 
water. Approx imately 90% of the iron entering the facility 
is in the oxidized form, to which arsenic has already 
sorbed. Figure 4 -9 provides charts show ing the frac tions 
of the total arsenic concentration made up by particulate 
arsenic and soluble arsenic [As(III) and As(V)].  
 
The Plant B water treatment system only removed arse -
nic that entered the facility in particulate form. This arse -
nic was most likely already sorbed to the oxidized iron 
entering the facility. Also, with an average  finished water 
total arsenic concentration of 11.9 µg/L, Plant B was not 
able to consistently remove arsenic from source water to 
low levels. However, arsenic removal would most likely 
be enhanced if a coagulant such as ferric chloride was 
included in the  treatment process.

pling. Similar to that observed during the pre liminary

treatment process, with  only a slight decrease in con cen-
tration between samples collected at the inlet and pre fil-
tration sampling locations. Fig ure 4-10 shows source 
water alkalinity, turbidity, pH, and hard ness concentra-
tions throughout the long -term sam pling phase. A verage 
alkalinity concentra tions at the inlet, prefiltra tion, and after -
filtration sampling loca tions were 140 mg/L, 137 mg/L, 
and 137 mg/L (as CaCO3), respec tively. Because the iron  
entered the facil ity already oxi dized, there was very little 
alkalinity reduc tion follow ing chlorination.  
 
During the long -term sampling, turbidity concen trations 
averaged 8.8 NTU at the inlet, 8.0 NTU at the PF loca -
tion, and 0.4 NTU in the finished water, which are con -
sistent with plant data. As shown in Figure 4 -10, source 
water turbidity concentrations fluctuated sig nificantly. 
These fluctua tions would be expected for a sur face water  
source and are probably a result of pre cipitation events 
and/or snowmelt. The plant was effec tive at removing 
turbidity. Hardness was not sig nificantly re moved by the 
treatment process. Average hardness con centrations in 
samples collected at the plant inlet, before filtration, and 
after filtration were measured at 443 mg/L, 421 mg/L, 
and 420 mg/L, respectively. As shown  in Figure 4-10, 
source water hardness appears to increase throughout the study, although the reason for this is not clear. 
Values for pH were relatively con stant through out the 
duration of the study and through out the treat ment pro-
cess. Average pH w as 7.9 in the source water, 7.7 prior 
to filtration, and 7.7 after filtration.  
 
Total aluminum concentrations at the IN and PF sam -
pling locations averaged approximately 22.0 µg/L and 
decreased in the AF samples to 13.9 µg/L. The major ity 
of the aluminum  detected in water sam ples from the inlet 
sampling location was particulate form. The dis solved 
aluminum concen tration was <11 µg/L through out the 
study at each sampling location. Due to the relatively low 
total alum inum concen trations, alum inum is not believed 
to have a significant effect on arsenic removal.  
 
Total manganese concentrations averaged 61.6 µg/L, 
50.3 µg/L, and 1.9 µg/L in samples collected at the inlet, 
prefiltration, and after -filtration sampling loca tions, respec -
tively. Average d issolved manganese con centrations were 
31.9 µg/L in the source water, 25.1 µg/L before filtration, 
and <0.5 µg/L after filtration. Pre vious studies have not 
correlated manganese re moval to arsenic removal; there -
fore, manganese is not believed to hav e a signifi cant 
impact on arsenic re moval efficiency.

Total iron concentrations in samples collected at the IN 
sampling location ran ged from 599 to 2,753 µg/L, with an 
average of 1,137 µg/L. At the PF sampling location, total 
iron concentrations ranged from 116 to 2,167 µg/L, with 
an average of 1,001 µg/L. The aver age iron concen -
tration in samples collected after fil tration was 66.7  µg/L. 
Also, dissolved iron con centrations were relatively low in 
the source water, averaging 107 µg/L. All dissolved iron 
was oxidized during chlori nation prior to filtration, result -
ing in aver age dissolved iron concentrations of <30 µg/L 
in samples collected at the prefiltration and after -filtration 
sampling locations. As stated previously, it is believed that 
arsenic re moval at Plant B is achieved primarily through 
filtration of arsenic sorbed to iron particles formed prior to 
entering the facil ity. 
 
4.3.4.3  Recycle Supernatant  
The filtered backwash water is sent to a concrete vat, 
where it is given time to settle. The supernatant water 
then is recycled to the inlet of the plant and mixed with 
the source water from the mining tunnel. On Novem ber 
10, 1998 and January 15, 1999, super natant sam ples 
were collected to determine the con centrations of arse -
nic, aluminum, iron, and manga nese recycled to the sys -
tem. The November 10 test results show that essentially 
all of the arsenic (142 µg/L average) in the recycle 
supernatant water was in particulate form. In contrast, the arsenic results from January 15, 1999 were signifi -
cantly lower (7.8 µg/L). This lower level most likely is 
because the plant did not operate in January 1999, there -
by giving the back wash water in the concrete vat more 
time to settle. During typical operations, as ob served in 
November 1998, the super natant from the con crete vat 
is recycled every 90  minutes. The results for alumi num, 
iron, and manga nese were signi ficantly less on January 
15, 1999 than on November 10, 1998, which is con sist-
ent with the re sults observed for arsenic. The recycled 
backwash water sample analytical results are shown in 
Table 4-12. 
 
4.3.4.4  Sludge  
Sludge is generated at Plant B from fi lter backwashing. 
Sludge that settles in the concrete vat is trans ferred to a 
sludge holding tank. Approximately once a year, sludge is 
removed from the sludge hold ing tank, processed through 
a filter press, and sent to a muni cipal landfill. Based on 
discussions with plant per sonnel, approxi mately 2 to 3 yd3
 
of dewatered sludge is sent to a non hazardous landfill  
every year. Sludge sam ples were not collected at Plant B 
as part of this study; however, the plant provided results 
from a sludge sampli ng event con ducted in January 1994. 
A primary com pound de tected in the sludge was Fe 2O3, 
which com prised 30.4% by weight. Arsenic was de tected 
at 6,700 mg/kg in the sludge sample.

 395.0  Quality Assurance/Quality Control  
5.1  Quality Assurance Objectives  
The precision, accuracy, MDL, and completeness for 
each of the analytical measurements required for this 
study have been established in the QAPP (Battelle, 
1998) and are listed in Table 1 of the Quality Assur ance/ 
Quality Control (QA/QC) Summary Report  (Battelle, 
2000), which was prepared  under separate cover. These 
terms serve as indicators of data quality and were 
calculated in accord ance with the formulas provided in 
the QAPP. The precision, accuracy, and MDL of each of 
the measurements performed during the present study 
are presented in the summary report. These quality 
assurance (QA) data are organized ac cording to the 
date of sample receipt or sample analy sis and are not 
site-specific. Therefore, the QA/QC sec tion of this report 
shares the same QA data with other water treatment 
plants that have been included in the study.  
 
5.2  Overall Assessment of Data Quality  
Quantitative QA objectives listed in the QA/QC Sum mary 
Report include precision as relative percent differ ence 
(RPD), accuracy as percent recovery (%R), MDL, and 
completeness. The precision, accuracy, and MDL or re -
porting limit of each of the measurements performed 
during the present study are presented in the QA/QC 
Summary Report . Total arsenic, alum inum, iron, and 
manganese analyses on water sam ples were conduct ed 
in Battelle’s ICP -MS labora tory. The QA data associated 
with these metal analyses also are pre sented in the 
QA/QC Sum mary Report . Other water quality param -
eters includ ing alkalinity, pH, turbidity, hardness, nitrate -
nitrite, sulfate, fluo ride, total dissolved solids (TDS), and 
TSS were analyzed by Wilson Envi ronmental La bor-
atories and their QA data are sum marized in the QA/QC 
Summary Report . QA data for TOC analysis performed 
by CT&E Envi ronmental Labor atory are presented in the 
QA/QC Su mmary Report . The TCLP metal analy sis on 
sludge samples also was conducted by Wilson Envi -
ronmental Laboratories and its associated QA data are 
summarized. Overall, the QA objectives of precision, accuracy, MDL, and com pleteness were achieved by all 
laboratories. Therefore, all the valid data were used to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment processes 
and support conclusions.  
 
5.2.1  Total Arsenic, Aluminum, Iron, 
and Manganese  
At the early phase of the study, total arsenic analysis 
was perfor med by Battelle’s ICP -MS laboratory, and total 
Al, Fe, and Mn were analyzed by Wilson Environmental 
Laboratories. Starting from June 1998, all four metals 
were analyzed by Battelle ICP -MS laboratory. There fore, 
QA data for only the total arsenic analysis before June 
16, 1998 and QA data for all four metals afterwards are 
presented.  
 
The laboratory duplicate and matrix spike analyses were 
performed every 10 samples instead of 20 samples as 
required by the QAPP. All the samples were analyzed 
for four metals although metals other than arsenic may 
not be required for every sample. Therefore, Battelle’s 
ICP-MS laboratory performed more QA/QC analyses 
than what were specified in the QAPP. This fact should 
be considered when QC data are evaluated.  
 
Greater than 99% of the precision results for all metals 
met the QA objective of ±25% (with only two Fe outliers: 
27% on August 8, 1998 and 74% on December 22, 
1998; three As outliers: 27% on August 18, 1998, 182% 
on October 1, 1998, and 27% on July 30, 1999; and four 
Al outliers: 26% and 33% on August 18, 1998, 48% on 
December 15, 1998, and 48% on January 25, 1999). 
The majority of the accuracy data associated with matrix 
spike (MS) analysis on August 31, 1998 ex ceeded the QA 
limits of 75 to 125%. It is suspected that  matrix spike 
analyses were not performed correctly on that day. After 
this problem had been identified, Battelle’s Work Assign -
ment Leader, laboratory QA officer, and Battelle’s task 
leaders met to discuss the cause of the deviation. Cor rec-
tive actions were taken including re -analyzing sam ples 
and adjusting the amount of spike added to sam ples (i.e.,  
 40the Fe spike was increased from 50 to 100, 200, 225, or 
even as high as 2,000  µg/L because most of samples 
contain much more than 50  µg/L of Fe). As in dicated in 
the QA/QC Summary Report  (Battelle, 2000), the matrix 
spike data quality was significantly improved since 
November 3, 1998. Exclud ing the data on August 31, 
1998, only five As data were outside the acceptable 
range for accuracy. However, 15 Al,  26 Fe, and 14 Mn 
accuracy data did not meet the QA objective. With 
exceptions of one 23% and one 38% of accuracy, the Al 
accuracy data range from 65 to 125%. The Mn accuracy 
data range from 67 to 106% with exception of one 37%. 
The Fe accuracy data range from 55 to 142% with excep -
tions of one 14%, one 23%, and one 38%.  
 
All laboratory control samples showed %R within the 
acceptable QA limit of 75 to 125% except for six outliers 
for total Fe with %R ranging from 73 to 143%. Al was not 
spiked to laboratory control samples until November 3, 
1998 after corrective actions were taken. The MDL of Fe 
is the same as target MDL; however, MDLs of other 
three metals were far below the target levels as specified 
in the QAPP.  
 
5.2.2  Water Quality Parameters  
Water quali ty parameters include alkalinity, pH, tur bidity, 
hardness (Ca and Mg), nitrate -nitrite, sulfate, fluo ride, 
TDS, TSS and TOC. As shown in Table 3 of the QA/QC 
Summary Report , all the precision data were within the 
acceptable QA limit of ±25% except for t wo Mn analyses 
with a 29% RPD (April 10 and 17, 1998) and three 
nitrate-nitrite analyses with 40% RPD (August 6, 1998, January 13, 1999, and February 11, 1999). The high 
RPDs of these analyses might have caused by the low 
measured concentrations in the sam ples that were close 
to the detection limits for Mn and nitrate -nitrite. The ac -
curacy data indicate that only one Al (70% on March 2, 
1998), two Mn (66% and 64% on May 12, 1998), and 
one Mg (126% on August 7, 1998) %R slightly exceeded 
the QA objectives o f 75 to 125%. Although the matrix 
spike duplicate (MSD) analysis was not required by the 
QAPP, the accuracy and the precision data relating to 
MSD also were presented. The MS/MSD analyses are not 
applicable to pH and turbidity measurements, though.  The 
laboratory did not perform MS/MSD analy ses on Ca and 
Mg hardness analyses until October 15, 1998 at Battelle’s  
request. All labor atory control sam ples showed %R 
within the acceptable QA limit of 75 to 125%. Reporting 
limits were below the required levels for all the analytes 
except for sulfate. The reporting limits of sulfate was 
5 mg/L, exceeding the required MDL of 3.66 mg/L. All 
precision, accuracy, and %R values for the TOC analy -
sis were within accept able QA limits with the exception 
of one accuracy  value that was slightly below the 75 to 
125% range at 72% (February 21, 1999).  
 
5.2.3  TCLP Metals in Sludge  
The TCLP metals analyzed in the sludge samples in -
cluded As, Se, Hg, Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Ag. The pre cision 
data were within QA limits of ±25%. The accuracy of 
matrix spikes and percent recovery of laboratory con trol 
samples were all within QA limits of 75 to 125% except 
for one slightly elevated RPD for TCLP Se MS/MSD at 
26% (November 17, 1998).
