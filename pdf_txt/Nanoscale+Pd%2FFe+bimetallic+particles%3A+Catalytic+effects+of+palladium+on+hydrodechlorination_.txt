Pd/Fe Bimetallic Particles
Hsing-Lung Lien1and Wei-xian Zhang2
Abstract: Chlorinated ethanes are contaminants commonly found in soil and groundwater. The potential of nanoscale bimetallic sFe/Pd d
particles for the hydrodechlorination of seven chlorinated ethanes sC2H6−xClxdwas evaluated in batch experiments. Hexachloroethane
(HCA )sC2Cl6d, pentachloroethane (PCA )sC2HCl5d, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (1,1,2,2-TeCA, C2H2Cl4), and 1,1,1,2-tetrachlorethane
(1,1,1,2-TeCA, C2H2Cl4)were rapidly hydrodechlorinated (9–28 min half-lives )at a nanoparticle loading of 5 g/L. End products were
ethane (61–87% )and ethylene (6–16% ). Only one chlorinated intermediate, a corresponding b-elimination product, appeared temporarily
during the reactions. Reductive dechlorination of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA, C2H3Cl3)to ethane was completed at a relatively
slower rate with half-life at 44.9 min. Little reduction of dichloroethane sC2H4Cl2dwas observed within 24 h. The Pd/Fe bimetallic
nanoparticles generally exhibit much higher reactivity when compared with conventional micro- and millimeter scale iron powders. Thehydrodechlorination reactions are more complete, with a much higher yield of ethane and lower yield of chlorinated byproducts.Akineticmodel incorporating a transition state species was proposed. Results from this work suggest that the Pd/Fe bimetallic nanoparticles mayrepresent a treatment alternative for in situ remediation of chlorinated ethanes.

Introduction
Chlorinated organic compounds are prevalent soil and groundwa-
ter contaminants. Chlorinated ethanes have commonly beenused as cleaning solvents in drying cleaning, in semiconductorfabrication, and in various industrial applications such as the pro-duction of refrigerants, herbicides, and plastics. Chlorinatedethanes, like many other chlorinated organic compounds, haveinevitably been discharged into the environment. Due to theirslow biodegradation and strong sorption, chlorinated ethanes havecaused widespread contamination of soil and groundwater. Recentinvestigations showed that chlorinated ethanes such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA )were among the most frequently
detected volatile organic compounds in groundwater in bothurban and rural areas (Squillace et al. 1999 ). Several of the chlo-
rinated ethanes including hexachloroethane (HCA ), 1,1,2,2-
tetrachloroethane (1,1,2,2-TeCA ), and 1,1,1-TCA have been
listed as priority pollutants by the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (USEPA 1979 ). Because of the potential threat to public
health, the development of cost-effective treatment technologiesis greatly needed.We have reported the synthesis and applications of nanoscale
bimetallic (Pd/Fe )particles as a remedial reagent for hydro-
dechlorination of various chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chlo-rinated ethenes, aromatics, and polychlorinated biphenyls (Wang
and Zhang 1997; Zhang et al. 1998; Lien and Zhang 1999, 2001 ).
The nanoscale metallic particles have typical diameters less than100 nm and feature 0.1–1% by weight of palladium deposited onthe surface of iron. The average speciﬁc surface area of the nano-particles is about 33.5 m
2/g, which is signiﬁcantly greater than
that of conventional microscale iron powder (typically ,1m2/g).
The surface-area-normalized reactivity skSAdof the nanoscale
Pd/Fe bimetallic particles is 1–3 orders of magnitude higher thanthat of conventional microscale iron particles. The high reactivityof nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles has been attributed to thelarge surface area and the presence of catalytic palladium on theiron surface.
The feasibility of injecting nanoscale bimetallic particles into a
contaminated aquifer has been demonstrated (Elliott and Zhang
2001 ). A small quantity (1.7 kg )of nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic
particles was gravity-fed into a testing zone where groundwaterwas contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE )and other chlori-
nated solvents. Up to 96% of TCE was dechlorinated within theplume ove r a 4 week monitoring period. The total TCE removal
was greater than 55% within a radius of 4.5 m after 8 weeks. Dueto their high reactivity and small size, nanoscale bimetallic par-ticles can serve as highly ﬂexible remediation vehicles in a vari-ety of environmental applications as demonstrated in the study. Inaddition to the in situ direct injection of nanoscale particles topromote in situ dechlorination, recent research suggests that nano-particles could be ﬁxed onto activated carbon, zeolite, or mem-brane for wastewater treatment (Zhang 2003 ).
Reaction kinetics and mechanisms for the transformation of
various chlorinated solvents with zero-valent iron have beenwidely reported (Matheson and Tratnyek 1994; Orth and Gillham

Roberts 1997; Arnold and Roberts 1998, 2000 ). Although it is
generally accepted that the reductive dechlorination is a surface-mediated reaction, the known facts of the reactions occurring atthe water–metal interface are rather limited (Weber 1996 ). The
limitations are largely due to the difﬁculty of gaining direct evi-dence from the water–metal interface. Although extensive litera-ture can be found on chlorinated ethenes sC
2H4−xClxd, little infor-
mation has been reported on the dechlorination of chlorinatedethanes sC
2H6−xClxdby zero-valent metals (Fennelly and Roberts
1997; Arnold et al. 1999 ). Reactions of chlorinated ethanes are
generally slower and typically produce many chlorinated byprod-ucts. As a part of our research on the treatment of diverse chlori-nated hydrocarbons, this paper focuses on the transformation ofchlorinated ethanes using nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles.Results on the rate and extent of transformation of chlorinatedethanes are presented. Reaction products were identiﬁed andquantiﬁed. Correlation analysis of reaction rates with one-electronreduction potential and bond strength were developed. A kineticmodel addressing the signiﬁcance of the surface reactions wasalso proposed. Evidence obtained from these analyses providesvaluable insights into mechanisms of the surface reactions.
Experiment
Chemicals and Materials
HPLC grade HCA, pentachloroethane (PCA ), 1,1,1,2-TeCA,
1,1,2,2-TeCA 1,1,1-TCA, tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and trichlo-
roethylene (TCE )were obtained from Aldrich. 1,2-
Dichloroethane (1,2-DCA ), 1,1-DCA, 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-
DCE ),trans-dichloroethylene (trans-DCE ),cis-dichloroethylene
(cis-DCE ), and a standard gas mixture containing methane,
ethane, ethylene, and C3–C4hydrocarbons (15 ppm each )were
obtained from Supelco. Standard gases of 1.04% ethylene and1.04% methane were acquired fromAldrich. Sodium borohydride(NaBH
4, 98% )and ferric chloride (FeCl3•6H2O, 98% )were pur-
chased from Aldrich. Palladium acetate (fPdsC2H3O2d2g3,P d
47.4% )was from Alfa.
Preparation of Nanoscale Metal Particles
Synthesis of nanoscale iron particles was achieved by adding 1:1
volume ratio of sodium borohydride (0.25 M )into ferric chloride
(0.045 M )solution. The borohydride to ferric iron ratio was 7.4
times higher than that of the stoichiometric requirement. Exces-sive borohydride was applied to accelerate the synthesis reactionand ensure uniform growth of iron crystals. Ferric iron was re-duced by borohydride according to the following reaction (Glavee
et al. 1995; Wang and Zhang 1997 ):
4Fe
3++3BH4−+9H2O!4Fe0#+3H2BO3−+12H++6H2" s1d
The suspension was mixed vigorously at room temperature
(2261°C). After the NaBH4was added to the FeCl3solution, the
mixture was stirred for 20 min or until visible hydrogen evolutionhad ceased. The metal particles formed from the above reactionhave sizes generally less than 100 nm (average 66.7 nm )and an
average speciﬁc surface area of 33.5 m
2/g(Wang and Zhang
1997 ).
Nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles were prepared by soaking
the freshly prepared nanoscale iron particles in an ethanol solu-tion with 0.5% by weight of palladium acetate. This caused the
reduction and subsequent deposition of Pd onto the Fe surface(Grittini et al. 1995; Wang and Zhang 1997 ).

Batch Experiments
Batch experiments were conducted in 150 mL serum bottles. For
each serum bottle, 20 µL of chlorinated ethane stock solution
prepared in methanol was spiked into a 50 mL aqueous solutioncontaining 0.25 g of nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles (5
gF e/L ). The initial concentration of chlorinated ethanes ranged
from 20 to 30 mg/L. The serum bottles were then capped withTeﬂon Mininert valves and mixed on a rotary shaker (30 rpm )at
room temperature 22 61°C. Parallel experiments were also per-
formed without the metal particles (control ). Analyses of organic
mass in the controls indicated that the total organic mass variedby less than 5% over the course of a typical experiment (,24 h).
Analytic Methods
At selected time intervals, a 20 µL headspace gas aliquot was
withdrawn using a gastight syringe for gas chromatography (GC)
analysis. Concentrations of chlorinated compounds were mea-sured by a HP5890 GC equipped with a DB-624 capillary column(J&W, 30 m 30.32 mm )and an electron capture detector (ECD ).
Oven temperature was programmed as follows: hold at 50°C for 5min; ramp at 20°C/min to 180°C, and hold for 5 min. Injector anddetector temperatures were set at 180 and 300°C, respectively.Calibration curves for each model compound were made initiallyand the variability was checked before analysis (,15%). Hydro-
carbon products (e.g., ethane and ethene )in the headspace were
quantiﬁed with HP5890 GC equipped with a ﬂame ionizationdetector and an AT-Q column (Alltech, 30 m 30.32 mm ). Con-
stant temperatures of oven, injection, and detector were set at 30,250, and 300°C, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Transformation of Chlorinated Ethanes
Seven chlorinated ethanes, HCA (C2Cl6), PCA (C2HCl5), 1,1,2,2-
TeCA (C2H2Cl4), 1,1,1,2-TeCA (C2H2Cl4), 1,1,1-TCA (C2H3Cl3),
1,2-DCA (C2H4Cl2), and 1,1-DCA (C2H4Cl2), were investigated
for their reactions with the nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles.Rapid and complete degradation of chlorinated ethanes wasachieved for HCA, PCA, TeCAs, and TCAs. However, no mea-surable (,5%)reduction of 1,1-DCAand 1,2-DCAwas observed
within 24 h. The logarithmic plots of concentration versus time
JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING © ASCE / JANUARY 2005 / 5were generally linear (r2.0.97), suggesting that the reaction can
be treated as pseudoﬁrst order. The observed rate constants andhalf-life are listed in Table 1. These data illustrate that the reac-tivity of the nanoparticles toward chlorinated ethanes is highlydependent on the degree of chlorination. Highly chlorinatedethanes (i.e., chlorine number ø4)had much higher reaction
rates, whereas, little reactivity was found with the lesser chlori-nated ethanes (i.e., chlorine number ł2).
Information on reaction intermediates and product distribu-
tions is also presented in Table 1. Comparable patterns of endproduct distributions were observed for the hydrodechlorinationof highly chlorinated ethanes with ethane as the primary product(61–87% ).Yields of ethylene were only 6–16%. For example, the
disappearance of HCA corresponded with the immediate appear-ance of ethane and ethylene [Fig. 1 (a)]. The yields of ethane and
ethylene averaged 87 and 6%, respectively. Tetrachloroethylene(PCE)was the main chlorinated intermediate (7.5% at maximum )
but no accumulation of PCE was found. Tetrachloroethylene isproduced apparently as a result of belimination from chlorinated
ethanes to ethylene. Our previous study demonstrated that PCEcan be completely dechlorinated by the nanoparticles (Lien and
Zhang 2001 ). Trace amounts of PCA and 1,1,2,2-TeCA were de-
tected very brieﬂy, and were near the detection limit (,10µg/L).
Compared with HCA, transformation of 1,1,1-TCA produced
much less ethane (,60%)[Fig. 1 (b)]. 1,1-DCA was the only
detectable chlorinated intermediate (,1%), which was com-
pletely degraded in 2–3 h. A trace level of ethylene (,1%)ap-
peared brieﬂy in the headspace. It is noteworthy that reactions ofchlorinated ethanes with conventional iron powders (from milli-
meters to micrometers )tend to produce mostly chlorinated
byproducts and no ethane. Because the chlorinated intermediatesare of great concern for their impact on human health and theenvironment, the low yield of chlorinated intermediates is a clearadvantage for the use of nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles.
Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis has been widely used to determine the rela-tionships between molecular characteristics, thermodynamic pa-rameters, and reaction rates (Johson et al. 1996; Scherer et al.
1998; Burrow et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2000 ). It is commonly used to
predict the reactivity of contaminants as well as to understand theunderlying reaction mechanisms. For example, an excellent cor-relation has been found between the reaction rate and the one-electron reduction potential for the dechlorination of chlorinatedethylenes with zero-valent iron (Arnold et al. 1999 ). Other meth-
ods of correlation include linear free energy relationships and/orquantitative structure–activity relationship based upon bond
strength and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy.
Due to the small size and large surface area of the nanopar-
ticles, the surface-area-normalized rate constant has been shownto be a useful tool to compare the results in the literature whichhas been typically generated with much larger iron particles(Johson et al. 1996 )

and 5 (g/L), respectively. The values of kSA(Table 2 )were deter-
mined by applying Eqs. (3)and(4).
In this study, one-electron reduction potentials and bond
strengths were used as the descriptors of correlation analysis.Data for the surface-area-normalized rate constants sk
SAd, one-
electron reduction potential (Arnold et al. 1999 ), and bond
strength (Liu et al. 2000 )for chlorinated ethanes are listed in
Table 2. The correlation results of log-surface-area-normalizedrate constant slnf1/k

and bond strength are illustrated in Fig. 2. The one-electron re-duction potential was moderately sr
2=0.598 dcorrelated with re-
action rates, whereas a highly correlated relationship sr2=0.809 d
between bond strength and reaction rate was obtained.
Correlation analysis as shown in Fig. 2 suggests that the rate
of hydrodechlorination varies inversely with the bond strength.The C–Cl bond strength in 1,1,1-TCAis 73.6 kcal/mole which issigniﬁcantly higher than that of HCA at 68.8 kcal/mole. Hence
the rate of 1,1,1-TCA transformation was slower than that ofHCA. Similar trends can also be observed with other chlorinatedethanes.
Results obtained in this work are consistent with the study by
Arnold et al. (1999 )in which a moderate correlation exists be-
tween reaction rate and one-electron reduction potential for sixchlorinated ethanes in reactions with zinc. For electrolytic dechlo-rination, the correlation between rate constants and bond strengthwas also excellent for chlorinated ethanes sr
2.0.90d(Liu et al.
2000 ).
Although one-electron reduction potential and bond strength
are often highly correlated to each other because both entail thecleavage of the carbon–halogen bond sRX+e
−!R•+X−d
(Scherer et al. 1998; Liu et al. 2000; Totten and Roberts 2001 ),
Sometimes divergent results as shown in Fig. 2 are also possible.In general, there is a large uncertainty associated with the calcu-lated values of one-electron reduction potential. Bond strength onthe other hand, tends to be more accurate and has been suggestedas a better descriptor for the correlation analysis (Totten and Rob-
erts 2001 ).
Sequential Dechlorination
Many studies suggest that the reduction of chlorinated aliphatics
especially biologically mediated reactions occur via a series ofstepwise reactions, i.e., the dechlorination is accomplished by re-moving one chlorine at a time, from HCA to PCA, TeCA, TCA,DCA, then to chloroethene, ﬁnally to ethane. We have indepen-dently obtained rate constants for all the chlorinated ethanes so itmay be possible to corroborate the conventional sequential hydro-genolysis pathway. However, invoking the stepwise reduction ofHCA to ethane failed to explain our experimental results. Calcu-lations based on independently obtained rate constants with thesequential dechlorination pathway would lead to a signiﬁcant ac-cumulation of DCAand a very low yield of ethane.Actual resultsshown in Fig. 1 (a)show a high yield of ethane and no accumu-
lation of DCA. Because of the low reactivity of DCA, directhydrogenolysis of DCA to chloroethane was limited. It is there-fore necessary to consider other route (s)for the formation of
ethane.
b
-Elimination
Transformation of highly chlorinated ethanes (chlorinated ethanes
with an a,bpair of chlorine atoms )by zero-valent metals has
been suggested to proceed via reductive belimination (Arnold et
al. 1999 ). The corresponding products from reductive belimina-
tion of higher chlorinated ethanes were found in this study. Forexample, the appearances of PCE, TCE, and 1,1-DCE with yieldsbetween 7.5 and 15% were found in the transformation of HCA,PCA, and 1,1,1,2-TeCA. Based on the observed products and in-termediates, one might consider reaction pathways for HCAtrans-formation to ethane as follows:

The above differential equations were solved by using a
MAPLE V software package. The rate constants of kS1andkS2can
be determined independently from the reactions of HCA andPCE, respectively. k
S1was measured to be 3.43 h−1(Table 1 ),
whilekS2was 2.1 h−1under identical conditions from our previ-
ous work (Lien and Zhang 2001 ). Simulation results and experi-
mental data are presented in Fig. 3. It is apparent from the simu-lation that a substantial amount of PCE (47% at maximum )
should have been detected if the reaction pathways shown in Eq.(5)governs. The actual yield of PCE was less than 10% through-
out the experiment. We are fairly conﬁdent that the conﬂictingresults between kinetic simulations and experiments cannot beattributed to analytic errors because the analytical method(GC-ECD )is very sensitive for PCE with a detection limit ap-
proaching 1 µg/L. Consequently, it may imply that the elimination
pathway as shown in Eq. (5)is probably not the major route of
HCA dechlorination.
Surface Complex Model
We therefore propose a new reaction pathway as illustrated inScheme 1 for the transformation of HCA. Our proposition buildson our experimental results as well as published observationsfrom many other studies. The key element for our proposal is asurface transitional species. As stated above, reactions of chlori-nated solvents with zero-valent metals are surface mediated(Weber 1996; Arnold and Roberts 2000 ). Surface-bound interme-diates such as di- s-bonded PCE resulting from reductive belimi-
nation of PCE have been proposed (Arnold and Roberts 2000 ).
The existence of a transition state during the transformation ofchlorinated ethanes is supported by our correlation analysis.Taken together, the evidence, although indirect, suggests that thesigniﬁcance of surface intermediates to chlorinated ethane trans-formation needs to be explored.
The crucial step in the proposed reaction pathway is the for-
mation of a transition state species fC
2Cl4g*, which could be the
corresponding b-elimination product (di-s-bonded PCE )during
the reaction. Reduction of HCA to PCE was observed in thisstudy. As noted earlier, PCE readily degraded to ethane in thepresence of nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles (Lien and Zhang
2001 ). Therefore, if fC
2Cl4g*exists during the HCA transforma-
tion, reactions between PCE and fC2Cl4g*should be reversible. In
Scheme 1, two separate pathways are also considered for the for-mation of ethane: direct generation from the transition state, andalso hydrogenation of ethylene.
The equations used to model the reactions illustrated in
Scheme 1 are listed as follows:

The rate constants that can be measured directly were kS1andkS2
as described above. The value of kS2is the sum of k+S2andk−S2
representing the forward and reverse reaction rate constants, re-
spectively, in the transformation of PCE. The values of k+S2,k−S2,
and other rate constants (i.e.,kS3,kS4, andkS5)were determined by
simultaneously solving Eqs. (10)–(13)while ﬁtting the model to
experimental data. The best-ﬁt results are shown in Fig. 4 and thebest-ﬁt values of k
+S2,k−S2,kS3,kS4, andkS5are provided in
Table 3.
The validity of this proposed model was further evaluated by
applying the rate constants to ﬁt the experimental data of PCEtransformation determined independently in our previous study(Lien and Zhang 2001 ). In the transformation of PCE, a small
amount of ethylene (,1%)was detected.Tetrachloroethylene was
converted mostly to ethane (80%). Results for the simulation of
ethane formation from the PCE degradation along with the ex-perimental data are shown in Fig. 5. In this simulation, the rateconstants that were applied included k
+S2,k−S2,kS3,kS4, andkS5.
Although the rate of ethane formation is underestimated slightlyby the model simulation, the rate constants determined from theHCA transformation fairly accurately explain the formation ofethane determined from the independent study of PCE transfor-mation.
As shown in Fig. 4, the model calculations essentially captured
all the major features of the experimental data of HCA dechlori-

ens the hypothesis of a surface intermediate. Ethane productionfrom direct transformation has the rate of 1 order of magnitudehigher than that of ethylene hydrogenation. This suggests that themajor route for ethane formation is likely to be the direct trans-formation of the surface intermediate (without the involvement of
PCE)while the hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane is probably a
minor reaction. In summary, the HCA transformation could con-sist of three independent reactions, HCA to ethanesk
s1,ks3,ks4,ks5d, HCA to PCE sks1,k−s2d, and PCE to ethane
sk+s2,ks3,ks4,ks5d.
The surface transition state can also explain other observations
as well. Because of the lack of an a,bpair of chlorine atoms,
1,1,1-TCA does not undergo the belimination. Studies have
shown that transformation of 1,1,1-TCA with zero-valent zincproceeds via concurrent aelimination and hydrogenolysis (Ar-
nold et al. 1999 ). In this work, however, hydrogenolysis of 1,1,1-
TCA to 1,1-DCA could account for less than 1% of the 1,1,1-TCAdegradation as no a-elimination product (i.e., 1,1-DCE )was
observed. Moreover, sequential hydrogenolysis of 1,1,1-TCA toethane is ruled out because the near-zero reactivity of 1,1-DCAessentially inhibits the stepwise reaction. Considering the effectof surface intermediates, it seems reasonable that a surface tran-sition state or intermediate may also play a role in reactions of1,1,1-TCA.The formation of surface intermediates on metal surfaces has
been observed in the reactions of many chlorinated organic com-pounds and hydrocarbons with metals in the gas phase. Hydrocar-bon moieties such as alkyl, carbene, and carbyne have been foundusing various surface-sensitive techniques (Baltruschat et al.
1993; Bent 1996 ). In aqueous solution, the formation of hydro-
carbon moieties has also been reported. For example, carbene,and carbyne species was observed in the transformation of chlo-rinated methanes (Zaera 1995 ). In the case of trichloroethanes,
formation of surface ethylidyne (CCH
3)has been reported on
transition metal surfaces in both gas and aqueous phase reactions(Müller et al. 1997; Hsiao et al. 1998 ).The surface ethylidyne has
been identiﬁed in the transformation of 1,1,1-TCAto ethane by apalladium electrode in aqueous solution (Hsiao et al. 1998 ).I n
this study, the transformation of 1,1,1-TCA resulting in substan-tial production of ethane could be explained by the formation ofethylidyne as a surface intermediate. Through ethylidyne, ethanecould be readily formed during the 1,1,1-TCA transformationwithout involving the sequential reactions that would result in theformation of lesser chlorinated ethanes as shown in the followingequation:

No suitable analytic method is currently available to obtain direct
evidence of the proposed surface-bound reaction intermediate.Nontheless the ﬁnal product distribution and kinetic calculationssupport the hypothesis that a surface-mediated dechlorinationleads to the formation of a transition species at the surface. Re-action mechanisms such as elimination and hydrogenolysis canaccount for less than 20% of the ﬁnal products from HCAdechlo-rination. Using the proposed model, hydrodechlorination of chlo-rinated ethanes with a high yield of ethane and low yields oflesser chlorinated intermediates, can be fully explained by thesurface intermediate.Table 3.
