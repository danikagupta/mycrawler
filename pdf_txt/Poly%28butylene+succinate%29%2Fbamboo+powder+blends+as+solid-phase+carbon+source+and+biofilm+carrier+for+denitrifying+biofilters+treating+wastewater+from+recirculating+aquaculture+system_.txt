The C/N ratio and carrier type strongly affect aerobic denitri ﬁcation and are critical for nitrogen removal
by sequencing batch reactor (SBR) processes. Poly (1,4-butanediol succinate) (1,4-PBS) is a biodegradablematerial that provides electrons to denitrifying microorganisms. The effect of carrier on the aerobic
denitrifying microorganisms is worth further studying. In this study, aerobic denitrifying microorgan-
isms were combined with 1,4-PBS to evaluate the effects of microbial biomass on the biodegradablecarriers and nitrogen removal ef ﬁciency. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that after 45 days
of the operation, the Shannon index of bacteria in the 1,4-PBS group increased from 4.48 (phase I, C/
N¼5a t1e8 days) to 5.74 (phase II, C/N ¼10 at 9 e20 days) and continuously increased to 6.68 in phase
III (C/N ¼20, 21 e45 days). The peak total nitrogen (TN), NH
4þ-N and total organic carbon (TOC) removal
efﬁciencies were 56.4%, 75.49% and 59.56% respectively at high C/N of 20. This result indicated that PBS
signiﬁcantly increased microbial diversity and indirectly changed the structure of microbial commu-
nities. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) showed that 1,4-PBS might change the microbialcommunity. Speci ﬁcally, 1,4-PBS might increase microbial diversity and indirectly change the structure of
microbial communities. Meanwhile, the content of extracellular polymeric substances increased to
416.33 g g
/C01VSS. 3D-EEM spectra showed that protein-like and humic acid-like substances were the
main components in SMPs, and the ﬂuorescence intensity increased in the initial 31 days and decreased
in the following 14 days. Therefore, 1,4-PBS can ef ﬁciently improve the nitrogen removal performance of
microbial communities. This study offers a reliable reference for the effects of biodegradable carriers on
the nitrogen removal performance of microorganisms.

1. Introduction
Biological methods are the main approach used for wastewater
nitrogen removal, and then activated sludge process is the main
biological wastewater treatment process in wastewater treatment
plants (WWTPs) around the world ( Chen et al., 2015 ). A wide va-
riety of functional microorganisms, such as nitri ﬁers and de-
nitriﬁers, are related to nitrogen removal in this process ( Zhao et al.,
2018 ). Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nitrite-oxidizing bacteriaare the main nitri ﬁers and transform ammonia into nitrate under
aerobic conditions. ( Gruber-Dorninger et al., 2015 ;Yamada et al.,
2019 ;Chen et al., 2015 ). Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrate into
nitrogen through denitri ﬁcation with organic carbon as the elec-
tron donor. At the same time, the current ‘Chinese Urban Waste-
water Treatment Plant Pollutant Discharge Standards ’(GB18918-
2002) limit the total nitrogen (TN) concentration of ef ﬂuent from
WWTPs to 15 mg L/C01. Strict WWTP discharge standards require a
stabler and highly ef ﬁcient removal performance by activated
sludge systems.
Heterotrophic denitri ﬁcation is the key process for biological
nitrogen removal, and it depends on the biodegradable carbon
source content in the system ( Shi et al., 2015 ). A limited amount of*Corresponding author.

microbes and worsen the nitrogen removal performance of the
system. As described by previous studies ( Ge et al., 2017 ), several
operational parameters, such as the ratio of the chemical oxygen
demand (COD) to nitrogen (COD/N), are the main factors in deni-
triﬁcation performance. However, the organic content in actual
wastewater generally does not reach suitable COD/N ratios ( Wang
and Chu., 2009 ). The performance of the activated sludge system
would be affected, leading to ef ﬂuent with characteristics below
China standard. Therefore, a carbon source needs to be added to
maintain its suf ﬁcient level in the wastewater. Aerobic denitri ﬁca-
tion has been proven to be one of the important nitrate metabolism
pathways, because it can convert nitrate into nitrogen under oxy-
gen conditions, which has attracted more and more attention ( Ji
et al., 2015 ). Different from the traditional denitri ﬁcation process,
aerobic denitrifying microorganisms contain a nap FDAGHBC gene
cluster, which is not sensitive in the presence of oxygen ( Zumft,
1997 ). Aerobic denitri ﬁcation can be converted nitrate into nitrite
by the enzyme encoded by napA gene. Subsequently, nitrite will be
sequentially converted into nitrogen by the enzymes encoded by
the genes nirS,norB and nosZ (Ruan et al., 2020 ), while the tradi-
tional denitri ﬁcation process has higher requirements for the
content of dissolved oxygen (for example, anoxic/aerobic process,
A/O) and space (sequencing batch reactor, SBR) ( Deng et al., 2019 ).
In many sewage treatment plants, liquid or soluble carbon
sources (e.g., ethanol, glucose, acetic acid and citric acid) are often
added to anoxic units to provide electron donors for denitri ﬁcation
(Aslan and Cakici, 2007 ;Chen et al., 2015 ;Shi et al., 2015 ;Mielcarek
et al., 2017 ). However, the carbon sources mentioned above are
easy to uptake, and the dosage is not controlled exactly; insuf ﬁcient
carbon sources lead to fewer electrons for denitrifying microor-
ganisms and worse performance. Nevertheless, adding an excess of
carbon source would increase the COD content in the ef ﬂuent ( Lee
et al., 2006 ). On the other hand, solid carbon sources such as
agricultural waste (e.g., stalks and timber) and biodegradable
polymers ( Lee and Wang, 2006 ) are applied as alternative carbon
sources to solve this problem. ( Wang and Wang, 2009 ). Biode-
gradable polymers can serve as both an organic carbon source and
bioﬁlm carrier for denitri ﬁcation, which would do not caused
starvation periods or overdosing of the carbon source. The solid
carbon source must undergo a degradation process to become
water-soluble, which could be caused by bacteria. It can provide
dissolved organic carbon that can be utilized by heterotrophic
bacteria ( Abou-Zeid et al., 2001 ). As a biodegradable carbon source,
agricultural wastes have been proven to promote denitri ﬁcation
performance ( Feng et al., 2017 ). However, intense color in the
efﬂuent and a very low denitri ﬁcation rate limit the wide applica-
tion of the carbon source ( Warneke et al., 2011 ;Xu et al., 2019 ). In
comparison, polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly (butylene succinate)
(PBS) are biodegradable and slowly release carbon into wastewater
(Liu et al., 2018 ). These organic carbon sources are hydrolytically
decomposed by enzymes produced by microorganisms, and the
resulting monomers are released and further taken up by micro-
organisms for denitri ﬁcation ( Wu et al., 2012 ;Liu et al., 2018 ). PBS
can be hydrolyzed by biological enzymes secreted by respective
bacteria, and the hydrolysate product can support metabolic use ofheterotrophic denitrifying bacteria ( Wu et al., 2015 ). In addition,
PBS use is not only economical but also less affected by environ-
mental changes, such as pH, than the use of other carbon sources
(Zhao et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, under hypoxic conditions, PBS can
reduce the negative effects of oxygen on the heterotrophic deni-
triﬁcation process ( Gutierrez-Wing et al., 2012 ). However, there are
few studies on the application of poly (1,4-butanediol succinate)
(1,4-PBS) as a solid carbon source for denitri ﬁcation. To our
knowledge, if 1,4-PBS is dosed as an organic carbon source, aerobicdenitri ﬁcation might be enhanced and the stability of reactor
operation can be improved, so the operating cost of wastewater
treatment would be greatly reduced ( Wu et al., 2015 ).
Based on the above descriptions, a suitable carrier for denitri-
ﬁcation communities is critical for nitrogen removal performance.
The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 1,4-
PBS carriers on nitrogen removal performance associated with
changes in microbial community characteristics in a sequencing
batch reactor (SBR). The total organic carbon (TOC), NH
4þ-N, NO 3/C0-N,
NO2/C0-N, TN and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) concen-
trations were also evaluated. Furthermore, high-throughput
sequencing was conducted to explore the differences in the struc-
tures of microbial communities. The microbial communities were
collected from different carriers in the SBRs. Alpha diversity, LEfSe
and phylogenetic analyses were conducted to elucidate the differ-
ences in the bacterial functional communities.
2. Materials and methods2.1. Biocarrier
The physical characteristics of 1,4-PBS (Ningbo Tianan
Biopolymer Co., Ltd., China) are as follows: density 1.18 kg L
/C01,
crystallinity 25 e35%, tensile strength 38% and ﬂexural strength
27 MPa. The 1,4-PBS was spherical with a size of
0.4 cm /C20.4 cm /C20.4 cm (width /C2length /C2height) and was
washed by an ultrasonic cleaner (1 kW, 50 kHz) and dried at 60/C14C.
At the beginning of the experiment, 1,4-PBS carrier with a volume
of 200 mL was added to the SBR reactor.
2.2. Seed microbial community
A seed microbial community was obtained from Zhejiang Tao-
huayuan Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd., and I-chip
technology was used to isolate and obtain the main aerobic deni-
trifying microbial community. The microbial community was stably
operated for 1 year at 25 ±2/C14C in an SBR. Before the microbial
community was added to other reactors, the microbial liquid was
mixed by a vortex mixer.
2.3. SBR setup and operation
Nitrogen removal capacity experiments were performed in two
laboratory-scale SBRs. R1 was the control group (C-SBR) and had no
added carrier. The R2 reactor received 1,4-PBS (1,4-PBS-SBR). The
same volume of microbial liquid was added to reactors R1 and R2.
In each SBR, the working volume was 7 L, and the cycle time was
24 h at ambient temperature (15 ±2e30±2/C14C). The experiment
ran for more than 45 days in total. The initial solid-liquid ratio of
the bacterial liquid and the 1,4-PBS carrier in the R2 reactor is 1:1,
which have reached to 700 ml L/C011,4-PBS carrier was used as an
extra carbon source for denitri ﬁcation.
During the study, the operation strategy of SBR reactor including
feeding for 20 min, anoxic conditions for 200 min, aeration for
960 min, settling for 240 min and decanting for 20 min. The ex-
change volumetric ratio was controlled at 60 e70% to fully utilize
the COD in simulated wastewater ( Zhang et al., 2020 ). The effects of
carriers on the nitrogen removal performance associated with
changes in microbial community structure were evaluated. In this
experiment, glucose was the carbon source. The different concen-
trations of COD, NH 4þ-N, and total phosphorus (TP) added into the
inﬂuent. Additionally, trace elements were dosed to the in ﬂuent. A
trace element solution was prepared according to Sun et al. (2017) .
During operation, the in ﬂuent COD/N ratio was increased by
changing the COD content because the demand of denitrifyingJ. Ding, B. Chen, Y. Zhang et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 291 (2021) 125279
2bacteria for carbon sources gradually increased. The dissolved ox-
ygen (DO) was controlled at 1.0 e2.5 mg L/C01during the aeration
phase by adjusting the air ﬂow rate. TOC-L was used to detect the
TOC released in the PBS-SBR reactor without microbial addition.
The reactors were operated for 45 days to investigate the TN
removal capacity of the SBRs after 1,4-PBS carriers were added.
Reactor operation was divided into three stages according to
inﬂuent C/N ratio, i.e., the start-up stage (phase I: C/N ¼5, 1e8
days), the low-COD/N stage (phase II: C/N ¼10, 9e20 days) and the
high-COD/N stage (phase III: C/N ¼20, 21 e45 days).
2.4. EPS extraction and characterization
EPS was extracted from biological samples of different reactors
in different stages by thermal extraction ( Cheng et al., 2019 ), and
polysaccharide were determined by the anthrone method ( Li and
Yang, 2007 ). The modi ﬁed Lowry method ( Yin et al., 2015 )w a s
used to determine the protein content.
2.5. Microbial community analysis
To analyze the microbial community of sludge, biomass samples
were collected at the end of each phase. The biological sample of R1
was composed of suspended sludge (Granular sludge was classi ﬁed
as a type of bio ﬁlm). Each R2 biological sample was composed of
suspended sludge and a 1,4-PBS carrier sample. A Power Soil DNA
Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) was used to extract mi-
crobial DNA. The microbial communities from sludge samples were
analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. The high-throughput
analysis method was according to Gao et al. (2020) . The V3 eV4
region of the bacterial 16 S ribosomal RNA gene was ampli ﬁed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the 515 F (50-barcode-
GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-30) and 907 R (50-CCGTCAATTCMTT-
TRAGTTT-30) primers. High-throughput sequencing analysis was
conducted by Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
The Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. used an Illumina MiSeq plat-
form to sequence the amplicons. Functional genes from the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database were ob-
tained by the PICRUSt program ( http://picrust.github.io/picrust/ ).
According to Wang et al. (2020) , The linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) effect size (LEfSe) pipeline was used to identi ﬁed the signif-
icantly discriminant taxa in each group. According to Bhat et al.
(2020) , used Principal component analysis (PCA) to analysis the
relative band intensity and positions of bacterial community
proﬁles.
2.6. Other analytical parameters
NH4þ-N, NO 3/C0-N and NO 2/C0-N and TN concentrations were deter-
mined following standard methods ( APHA, 2012 ). The TOC con-
centration was obtained using a TOC analyzer (TOC-L, Shimadzu,
Kyoto, Japan). Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) ﬂuorescence
spectra were acquired using a ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer (LS-
55, Perkin-Elmer Co., USA).
3. Results and discussion3.1. Nitrogen removal performances of the 1,4-PBS-SBR and the C-
SBR
The reactors were operated for 45 days to investigate the TN
removal capacity of the SBRs after 1,4-PBS carriers were added.
Reactor operation was divided into three stages according to time,
i.e., the start-up stage (phase I: C/N ¼5, 1e8 days), the low-COD/N
stage (phase II: C/N ¼10, 9e20 days) and the high-COD/N stage(phase III: C/N ¼20, 21e45 days). The amount of microorganisms in
the SBR reactor gradually increased with the operating time of the
reactor increased. The demand for nutrients also gradually
increased. Hence, we have applied different TP concentration.
In phase I, the in ﬂuent NH
4þ-N, TP, and COD concentrations were
15, 2, and 100 mg L/C01, respectively. The NH 4þ-N removal perfor-
mances of the two reactors are shown in Fig. 1 . Signi ﬁcant differ-
ences in the NH 4þ-N removal performances in the two reactors were
observed. In phase I, the average removal ef ﬁciency of NH 4þ-N in the
reactors were 58.82% (R1) and 51.34% (R2). Correspondingly, the
concentrations of NO 2/C0-N and NO 3/C0-N in the ef ﬂuent exhibited
different trends, as shown in Fig. 1 CeE and D-F, and the NO 3/C0-N and
NO2/C0-N concentrations in R1 remained at low levels. In contrast, the
NO2/C0-N concentration in R2 gradually increased, while the NO 3/C0-N
concentration in R2 gradually decreased. The increase in NO 2/C0-N
concentration and decrease in NO 3/C0-N concentration may be caused
by the bio ﬁlm. Compared to C-MBR, microorganism was rapidly
adhered onto the carriers, forming the coexistence of aerobic and
anoxic micro-environment and providing the realization condi-
tions for simultaneous nitri ﬁcation-denitri ﬁcation. According to
Wang et al. (2018) , the various functional microorganisms could
coexisted in bio ﬁlm in the presence of an oxygen gradient. It is well
reported that ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation mainly
occurred in suspended sludge, and denitri ﬁcation was the major
contribution of bio ﬁlm (Lo et al., 2010 ).
The TN removal performances of the two reactors during
operation are shown in Fig. S2 . The average TN removal ef ﬁciency
remained at 44.4 ±2.3% (C-SBR) and 39.5 ±1.5% (1,4-PBS-SBR).
which might be attributed to the differences in denitrifying mi-
crobial activity. It was inferred that the coexistence of aerobic and
anoxic microenvironments gradually formed with suspended mi-
croorganisms adhering to 1,4-PBS and provided better conditions
for denitri ﬁcation than R1 ( Wang et al., 2018 ).
In phase II, NH 4þ-N (15 mg L/C01), COD (150 mg L/C01), and TP
(2 mg L/C01) were added to the in ﬂuent. The results indicated that the
average removal ef ﬁciencies of NH 4þ-N in the reactors were 50.92%
(R1) and 52.47% (R2). As shown in Fig.1 CeD and E-F, the NO 2/C0-N and
NO3/C0-N concentrations in R1 remained at low levels. In contrast, the
NO2/C0-N concentration in R2 increased sharply, while the NO 3/C0-N
concentration increased slightly. The average TN removal ef ﬁciency
in the C-SBR and 1,4-PBS-SBR remained at 36.7 ±3.1% (C-SBR) and
47.3±2.3% (1,4-PBS-SBR), respectively. At the same time, the
average ef ﬂuent NO 2/C0-N concentration in the 1,4-PBS-SBR remained
at 1 mg L/C01. It is worth noting that the concentration of NO 2eNi n
the ef ﬂuent remained at 1 mg L/C01,but the concentration of NO 3/C0-N
increased slightly at the end of phase II. Because enough carbon
source was provided throughout the operation, nitrogen was
mainly removed by denitri ﬁcation and biological nitrogen assimi-
lation. ( Gan et al., 2019 ).
In phase III, NH 4þ-N (15 mg L/C01), COD (300 mg L/C01), and TP
(4 mg L/C01) were added to the in ﬂuent, and the concentrations of
these nutrients in the ef ﬂuent were greatly reduced. The average
removal rates of NH 4þ-N in the reactors were 40.58% (R1) and
62.05% (R2). The NO 2/C0-N concentration in R1 grew to a certain
extent, with an average accumulation of approximately 1 mg L/C01.
This behavior might have occurred because the microorganisms inthe R1 reactor were in a free state and the microorganisms secreted
EPS to protect themselves, causing the amount of carbon for
denitri ﬁcation to be insuf ﬁcient. The resulting denitri ﬁcation re-
action stopped at nitrite ( Ye et al., 2017 ). In R2, the maximum
concentration of NO
2/C0-N was 2 mg L/C01. Compared to the range in
phase II, the range of NO 3/C0-N concentrations was small. Simulta-
neously, the average TN removal ef ﬁciency in the C-SBR and 1,4-
PBS-SBR remained at 40.1 ±3.2% and 56.4 ±4.1%, respectively.
With increasing COD/N ratio, the TN removal rates of the twoJ. Ding, B. Chen, Y. Zhang et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 291 (2021) 125279
3reactors exhibited similar trends. The TN removal rate of the 1,4-
PBS-SBR was higher than that of the C-SBR. This phenomenon
might be caused by the carrier and additional carbon source in the
1,4-PBS-SBR reactor. This result indicated that the bio ﬁlms coex-
isting in R2 could play important role in denitri ﬁcation. More
importantly, the denitri ﬁcation capacity of the reactor mainly
comes from bio ﬁlms ( Lo et al., 2010 ).
3.2. TOC removal capacities of the 1,4-PBS-SBR and C-SBR
The TOC removal performances of the two reactors during the
whole operation are shown in Fig. S1 . Signi ﬁcant differences in the
TOC removal ef ﬁciencies of the two reactors were observed. TOC
consumption was mainly for microbe growth and denitri ﬁcation.
The average removal rates of TOC in the reactors were 28.47% (R1)
and 42.78% (R2), respectively, in phase I. The poor TOC removal rate
in the early stage (1 e8 days) was attributable to cell oxidation, as
the microbial community of the inoculum required time to adapt to
the new environment. In this stage, the microorganisms were in a
free state and easily oxidized, which resulted in the low activity of
microorganisms ( Chen et al., 2015 ;Zhang et al., 2019 ). From phase IIto the ﬁnal stage, the average removal rates of TOC in the reactors
were 40.43% (R1) and 59.56% (R2), respectively. The TOC removal
rate in R2 reached 59.56% and ﬂuctuated as the organic matter
fraction was released from the 1,4-PBS to the water. The average
content of TOC released from 1,4-PBS was 18.3 ±1.8 mg L/C01
(Fig. S3 ). It might indirectly increase the COD content, thereby
changed of the COD/N ratio. Organic matter was taken up by het-
erotrophic microorganisms for metabolism, and a high TOC
removal rate was observed within a short time ( Wang and Wang,
2009 ).
3.3. Biomass and EPS concentration variations in the 1,4-PBS-SBR
and C-SBR
As shown in Fig. 2 A, the increase in MLSS in the two reactors was
mainly caused by microbial growth. From phase I to phase II, MLSS
in the C-SBR and 1,4-PBS-SBR increased from 788.7 to
1645.9 mg L/C01and from 887.7 to 2030.7 mg L/C01, respectively. It is
speculated that this phenomenon might be caused by extra carbon
sources from 1,4-PBS. In phase III, MLSS in the C-SBR and 1,4-PBS-
SBR were maintained at high levels with values greater than
Fig. 1. Performances of the different reactors in a synthetic wastewater degradation experiment based on the NO 2eN, NO 3eN, and NH 3eN concentrations; (A, C, E) R1 (control) and
(B, D, F) R2 (1,4-PBS).J. Ding, B. Chen, Y. Zhang et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 291 (2021) 125279
42000 mg L/C01. This might be due to the increased COD/N ratio ( Feng
et al., 2019 ). In the 1,4-PBS-SBR, as the cells attached to the carrier
surface, a bio ﬁlm was rapidly formed. The MLSS content in phase III
was close to 3000 mg L/C01, greater than that in the C-SBR
(2456 mg L/C01), which meant that 1,4-PBS was important for the
microbial growth superiority in this reactor ( Xu et al., 2018 ). Pre-
vious studies suggested that the bacteria loading rate could be an
important factor in the stability and performance of the bio ﬁlm via
inﬂuencing the microbial community ( Hamza et al., 2018 ). At the
same time, the MLSS content of the bio ﬁlm on the surface of 1,4-
PBS was much higher than that of suspended sludge, indicating
that 1,4-PBS could not only feed biomass but also improve the
sludge attachment characteristics, reducing sludge washout ( Wang
and Chu, 2016 ;Li et al., 2019a,b ). In this study, the microbes in
1,4PBS-SBR were affected by higher C/N ratio and carrier during the
domestication, which may help to increase the enrichment of
ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria. The enrichment of
ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria would enhance the
reactor performance.
According to Wang et al. (2014a) , PS and PN were the main
component of EPS. PN and PS content are helpful for the structuralstability of activated sludge. Both of them were the one of the main
materials for forms a three-dimensional scaffold structure with
other biopolymers ( Xiao et al., 2018 ). The main aim of this study
was to explore the effect of carriers on the microbial community
structure. According to Li et al. (2019a) , changes in EPS content
were mainly represented by changes in PS and PN content. The
reactors were operated for more than 45 days to investigate the
variations in EPS after the addition of carriers. The EPS in the
different reactors was analyzed by thermal extraction and anthrone
method. As shown in Fig. 2 B, as the operation time of the SBRs
increased, the EPS content ﬁrst increased and then decreased. In
phase I, the EPS content in R2 was 261.33 g g
/C0volatile suspended
solids (VSS), higher than that in R1 (119 g g/C01VSS). The 1,4-PBS in
R2 gradually released organic carbon into the wastewater ( Wang
and Wang, 2009 ). A suf ﬁcient amount of organic carbon increases
the EPS content ( He et al., 2018 ). In the low-C/N stage (phase II), the
EPS content of both reactors increased more and accumulated at
greater levels in R2 (416.33 g g/C01VSS) than in R1 (313 g g/C01VSS).
This result indicates that at low-C/N ratios, a large amount of EPS
was secreted to protect microbes and maintain higher microbial
activity. The 1,4-PBS in R2 provides not only a carrier for microor-
ganisms but also suf ﬁcient carbon for heterotrophic microorgan-
isms to remove TN. It was speculated that the increase of EPScontents was due to more TOC content, which would promote the
sludge aggregation and stable operation. In phase III, the EPS con-
tent of both reactors decreased. But EPS contents of 1,4-PBS-SBR
was lower than that of C-SBR although the relative abundance of
the main EPS secretion microbe. The EPS content was higher in R1
(208.67 g g/C01VSS) than in R2 (94.00 g g/C01VSS). It was inferred that
the consumption of EPS was more powerful than in 1,4-PBS-SBR.
On the other hand, according to Sheng et al. (2010) , EPS can protect
cells in harsh environments and act as a carbon source for starving
cells. The growth of the bio ﬁlm increased with the increased of C/N
ratio, which would cause the bio ﬁlm on the surface of the 1,4-PBS
carrier too thickness. The thick bio ﬁlm would hinder the mass
transfer of nutrients, which made the microorganisms inside of the
bioﬁlm cannot get enough nutrients. Although 1,4-PBS provided an
amount of carbon source for the microorganisms inside the bio ﬁlm,
it still cannot meet their growth. Therefore, the microorganisms on
the bio ﬁlm will decompose EPS to provide their own growth and
metabolism. Hence, EPS content might decrease ( Wang et al.,
2019b ;Zhang et al., 2018 ).
3.4. EEM ﬂuorescence spectral analysis of the variations in ef ﬂuent
SMPs
Soluble microbial products (SMPs), as secondary pollutants,
account for an important percentage of COD residues in wastewater
generated from biological wastewater treatment. Hence, this study
used EEM ﬂuorescence spectra to detect SMPs in the ef ﬂuent of the
two reactors at different stages. As shown in Fig. 3 , two peaks can
be identi ﬁed in the EEM spectra. The ﬁrst peak represented aro-
matic proteins (Ex/Em: 220 e250/330-360 nm). The second peak
represented SMP-like materials (Ex/Em: 250 e300/330-360 nm)
(Chen et al., 2003 ). As the operation time of the SBRs increased, the
ﬂuorescence intensity of SMPs ﬁrst increased and then decreased.
As shown in Fig. 3 , there was a signi ﬁcant difference in the SMP
ﬂuorescence intensity of the ef ﬂuent of the two reactors in phase I.
The SMP ﬂuorescence intensity was higher in R2 than in R1. In the
R2 reactor, the 1,4-PBS carrier provided an additional carbon source
for the microorganisms, so the EPS content was higher than in R1.
Simultaneously, microorganisms used TOC for their own meta-
bolism and denitri ﬁcation, which gradually increased the ﬂuores-
cence intensity of SMPs. ( Wu et al., 2016 ). In phase II, after the
reactors had been operated for 20 days, the concentrations of SMPs
in the reactors increased differently. This result indicated that mi-
crobial activity may be different in the two reactors. Carriers can

5protect microorganisms ( Lu et al., 2014 ). During the adhesion of
microorganisms, free microorganisms swim in close proximity to
the solid surface until they ﬁnd a nutritious habitat for initial
contact, then secreting EPS. The secretion of EPS might cause mi-
croorganisms to be more ﬁrmly adsorbed on the surface of the
carrier. The uronic acid in EPS would exert its gelation properties
and reduced the detachment of microorganisms. In the subsequent
colonization of bacteria, the cells will produce more EPS. It would
enhance the extent to which bacteria adsorb on solid surfaces,
which helps the bacteria community adapt to the environment ( Jia
et al., 2017 ). Carriers can provide attachment points for microor-
ganisms and promote the agglomeration of microorganisms. Ac-
cording to Jia et al. (2017) , uronic acids are produced by
microorganisms as they grow, resulting in the increased content of
an unbranched exopolysaccharide composed of multiple uronic(Ferrentino et al., 2016 ). Eventually, the microbes stick to the car-
rier. These processes improved the resistance of microorganisms to
environmental changes. In phase III (32 days), the ﬂuorescence
intensities of the ef ﬂuent SMPs decreased gradually in both re-
actors. Independent of the SBR operation mode, the anoxic phase
promoted SMP degradation in both reactors ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). As
a result, the SMP ﬂuorescence intensity in the ef ﬂuent gradually
decreased.
3.5. Analysis of the microbial community
3.5.1. Diversity and richness of the microbial community
Values of the a-diversity indices (Chao, Shannon, Simpson, and
ACE) are shown in Table 1 . A large number of microorganisms were
trapped in the pores of carriers; therefore, the resistance of

6microorganisms to adverse environments gradually increased. The
a-diversity indices for samples from the three phases were
compared, and as the operation time of the SBR increased, the
Shannon index, ACE and Chao values of R2 gradually increased from
4.48, 450 and 438 to 6.68, 810 and 789, respectively. At the same
time, the Shannon index of R1 gradually decreased. At the end of
the experiment, the Shannon index was highest in R2. The data
presented in Table 1 indicates that the reactor with 1,4-PBS carrier
had higher microbial richness and diversity.
As shown in Fig. 4 A, the number of operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) shared among all the R1 and R2 samples was 4864, ac-
counting for 85.48% of the total OTUs (5990), which indicated that
there were differences in the bacterial community in each phase
during the experiment. The results of PCA of six samples are shown
inFig. 4 B. The contribution rates of components 1 and 2 to sample
variation were 39.97% and 30.34%, respectively. The data indicated
that the microbial community structures of the six samples were
divided into four clusters: R2-1, R1-1, R2-3-R2 e2 and R1-2 eR1-3.
To determine the key factors that led to changes in the microbial
community structure, this study analyzed the effects of the carrier,
COD/N ratio and substrate type. For substrate type, the controlgroup used glucose as a carbon source, while the 1,4-PBS group
used 1,4-PBS/glucose as an organic carbon source, which might
cause differences in the microbial community structure.
3.5.2. Composition and diversity of the microbial community
As shown in Fig. 5 A, there were differences in the relative
abundances of the dominant phyla of the bacterial communities in
different reactors. Samples from the three phases were compared,
and the dominant phylum was Proteobacteria in both reactors, with
relative abundances of 71.53% and 75.36%. The average relative
abundance of Bacteroidetes was 20.43% as the second populous
bacteria phylum in both systems. Bacteroidetes are involved in the
hydrolysis of macromolecular substances under anaerobic or
anoxic conditions, which is one of the important parts of denitri-
ﬁcation ( Lee et al., 2011 ;Pishgar et al., 2019 ). A difference in the
relative abundances of Bacteroidetes made the nitrogen removal
performance of the two reactors different. In addition, unique en-
vironments cultivate their own unique microorganisms, such as
Verrucomicrobia . The bacteria in the phylum Verrucomicrobia is
living in freshwater ( Lemke et al., 2009 ) that can ﬁx nitrogen
(Khadem et al., 2010 ), oxidize methane ( Lee et al., 2009 ) and
degrade PS ( Martinez-Garcia et al., 2012 ).Verrucomicrobia generally
have a high relative abundance in oxic zones ( Zhou et al., 2019 ).
Verrucomicrobia was capable of degrading complex polysaccharides
(Luo et al., 2014 ). This taxa potentially play an important role in the
degradation of polysaccharides in aquatic ecosystems. And ac-cording to Feng et al. (2019) ,Verrucomicrobia could serve to act as a
bioﬁlter to reduce methane emissions into the atmosphere. This
showed that the environment where Verrucomicrobia exists might
be an environment where hypoxia and aerobic environment
coexist. Hence, several genera of the
Verrucomicrobia have been
shown to possess clade II nosZ gene. Therefore, Verrucomicrobia canimprove denitri ﬁcation performance in a certain extent.
As shown in Fig. 5 B, there were differences in the relative
abundances of the dominant class of the bacterial communities in
different reactors. Gammaproteobacteria ,Bacteroidia ,Alphaproteo-
bacteria ,Actinobacteria ,Deltaproteobacteria and Clostridia were
abundant classes in six samples, with relative abundances of
89.40%, 23.25%, 14.89%, 3.68%, 4.40% and 4.99%, respectively.
However, the relative abundances of the above classes in the six
samples varied signi ﬁcantly.
To get further insight into the bacteria structure, the bacteria
abundance of the two reactors in genus level was investigated. As
showed in Fig. 5 andTable 2 , the relative abundances of Cupriavidus
and Azospira in 1,4-PBS-SBR were increased from no detect (phase
I) to 11.89% and 21.5% (phase III), respectively. But the relative
abundance of these two bacteria in the C-SBR reactor were main-
tain at low level (below 1%) during the whole experiment. It is
obvious that in 1,4-PBS-SBR, the abundance of Cupriavidus and
Azospira was higher than that in C-SBR (no carrier), and the TN
remove ratio of both reactor suggested the similar trend. This result
might mainly owing to the carrier. Both of them have been detected
in simultaneous nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation (SND) systems ( Xie
and Yokota, 2006 ). When the in ﬂuent C/N ratio increased, the
bioﬁlm thickness gradually increased, which might caused the
more thickness anaerobic area at carrier. This process brought
about the abundance of Cupriavidus and Azospira increased. The
increases in the relative abundances of Cupriavidus and Azospira
can indirectly indicate that a stable SND process was established in
the 1,4-PBS-SBR. This also indirectly proved that why the 1,4-PBS-
SBR reactor has a stronger ability to remove TN than the C-SBR
reactor. The abundance of Flavobacterium in the C-SBR was
increased from 0.08% to 5.64%, and 1.48% in 1,4PBS-SBR. This result
was connected with the increasing EPS content, which was
consistent with the result of EPS. Flavobacterium species with hy-
drolytic function is important for the formation of sludge ﬂocs
because they easily combine with gel masses during growth ( Du
et al., 2017 ). It might be caused by adding carrier in the C-SBR. To
resist changes in external environmental factors, microorganisms
secrete EPS to protect themselves, resulting in the microorganisms
gradually gathering. Therefore, the relative abundances of Fla-
vobacterium as the skeleton of activated sludge might gradually
increase. Flavobacterium might responsible for the part of MLSS
increased in the C-SBR. Moreover, the changed trend of Clostridium
were similar in C-SBR reactor and 1,4PBS-SBR reactor. In the phase
II, the C-PBS contained more Clostridium than the 1,4PBS-SBR, with
the percentage of 2.64% and 0.78% in C-PBS and 1,4PBS-SBR,
respectively, which compared with phase I were decreased by
16.95% and 4.09%. At the low C/N ratio (phase I), microorganisms
would secrete EPS ( Qiu et al., 2016 ). This resulted in that the EPS
content in phase I were highest among the three phases for both
reactors. Clostridium included bacteria have the capacity to degrade
biopolymers under anaerobic conditions. In addition, Clostridium
mainly grows in an anaerobic environment, which might indirectly
indicated that there were different ranges of anaerobic environ-
ments in the two reactors. Along with C/N ratio increased, the EPS
content gradually decreased, the structure of the bio ﬁlm disinte-
grates to a certain extent, and the relative abundance of Clostridium
decreased. This might be the reason for the ﬂuctuation of the TN
removal rate and NH 4þ-N removal rate of the both reactors. In the
phase III, with the increase of the C/N ratio, the bio ﬁlm structure
gradually stabilized in both reactors. The relative abundance of
Clostridium gradually increased to 1.47% in R1 and 1.41% in R2,
respectively. Simultaneously, the performance of the two reactors
gradually stabilized. According to Chu and Wang., (2016) , the
degradation by-products of Clostridium can be used for denitri ﬁ-
cation through bacterial nitri ﬁcation. This could infer that theTable 1

8increase in the relative abundance of Clostridium may enhance the
denitri ﬁcation performance of the reactor ( Sun et al., 2019 ). Ac-
cording to Chen et al. (2020) , during eight months of operation at
natural conditions, pyrite based bioretention system (PBS) can
adapt to low temperature and irregular wet and dry alternation,
achieving the average NH4þ-N, TN and TP removal ef ﬁciency of
87.6%, 89.3% and 81.6%, respectively. The dominant genera in PBS
were Denitratisoma ,Ellin6067 and Thiobacillus , which were highly
related to autotrophic denitri ﬁcation. In the up- ﬂow solid-phase
(PBS) denitri ﬁcation bio ﬁlm reactor ( Gao et al., 2020 ), after 100
days operation, the nitrate and COD removal ef ﬁciencies were high
of 97% and 80%, respectively. Simplicispira ,Diaphorobacter ,Hydro-
genophaga ,Pseudoxanthmonas and Stenotrophomonas were the
dominate genera in the reactor, which were responsible for the
removal of nitrate, organics and degradation of solid carbon source,
respectively. In general, the PBS carrier will change the microbial
community structure and promote the enrichment of denitrifying
bacteria.
3.5.3. LDA comparing bacterial communities in reactors with
different carriers
In addition, LEfSe analysis was used to determine the signi ﬁcant
differential distribution of microorganism groups in relationship to
the carrier. As shown in Fig. 6 , differential species of 2 phyla, 5
classes, and 13 genera were screened as indicator species in R2.
Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla
within R2. At the genus level, the microorganisms with signi ﬁcant
differences were Curvibacter ,Enterobacter ,Comamonas ,Diaphor-
obacter , and Cloacibacterium . These microbes had aerobic denitri-
ﬁcation capabilities and required high amounts of carbon and
nitrogen for aerobic denitri ﬁcation. When the COD/N ratio in-
creases, the denitri ﬁcation activity of these bacteria increases. This
enhanced the ability of the R2 reactor to remove TN. Cloa-
cibacterium species can also perform denitri ﬁcation and are
important in the removal of nitrogen pollutants in wastewater
treatment. The results indicate that the 1,4-PBS carrier increases
the relative abundances of Curvibacter ,Enterobacter ,Comamonas ,
Diaphorobacter and Cloacibacterium , thereby enhancing the TN
removal rate of the R2 reactor. Hence, the structure and function of
the bacterial community may be markedly changed with 1,4-PBS
carriers.
3.6. Prediction of functional genes
The microbial community played an important role in nutrientremoval, and structures with an abundance of denitrifying bacteria
were important for nitrogen removal. To date, detailed analyses of
denitrifying bacterial variation are still limited in the 1,4-PBS-sup-
ported SND system. As shown in Fig. S4 , clusters of orthologous
group (COG) categories were applied to predict potential microbial
metabolism based on marker gene data and a database of reference
genomes. The potential microbial metabolism could provide useful
insights into changes in microbial community structure ( Zhang
et al., 2017 ;Langille et al., 2013 ). The COG categories related to A
(amino acid transport and metabolism) were more abundant in the
1,4-PBS-SBR than in the C-SBR. There were signi ﬁcant differences in
the gene families of the six samples. The dominated genus, Coma-
monas , included the functional genes of denitri ﬁcation, including
narH, narJ, narB, nirS and norB , followed by the genus Cupriavidus ,
with 5 types of denitri ﬁcation functional genes. Stenotrophomonas
and Flavobacterium both had 3 types of denitri ﬁcation functional
genes, and the genus of Diaphorobacter ,Pseudomonas and Azohy-
dromonas all contained 2 denitri ﬁcation-related genes. The relative
abundances of these microorganisms were higher in the 1,4-PBS-
SBR than in the C-SBR. The functional genes narH, narJ, narB, nirS
and norB might play a major role in the PBS-SBR system. The
functional gene abundance of the microbial communities indirectly
indicated the nutrient removal potential. Furthermore, the 1,4-PBS
carrier changed the community structure of microorganisms,
which caused changes in the relative abundances of microbial
functional genes, eventually causing changes in reactor
performance.
3.7. Comparison of 1,4-PBS carriers with other carriers involved in
denitri ﬁcation
The above results indicated that 1,4-PBS carriers might be
suitable for aerobic denitrifying bacteria. Compared with the C-SBR,
systems with a 1,4-PBS carrier exhibited signi ﬁcantly increased
nitrogen removal ef ﬁciency. Moreover, the ef ﬁcient aerobic deni-
triﬁcation in 1,4-PBS systems was slightly affected by DO
(3.5e4.0 mg L/C01), as described by previous studies ( Meng et al.,
2008 ). The pathways of microbial nitrogen removal were deter-
mined by the relative abundance and structure of functional mi-
crobes. Traditional denitri ﬁcation and aerobic denitri ﬁcation are
the main denitri ﬁcation pathways in this study ( Lu et al., 2014 ). As
shown in Fig.1 , high NO 2/C0-N accumulation in phase II of the 1,4-PBS-
SBR operation facilitated partial nitri ﬁcation and aerobic denitri ﬁ-
cation ( Guo et al., 2009 ). The 1,4-PBS carriers might microscopically
change the DO level in the system and in ﬂuence the nitrogen
conversion pathways. Generally, the presence of EPS is regarded to
be helpful to SND, which is generally related to hydrophobicity.
Therefore, under conditions of high DO (3.5 e4.0 mg L/C01), the
accumulation of NO 2/C0-N could be explained by the formation of
microanaerobic zones through the pores and voids on the surface of
the 1,4-PBS carrier according to the results of Guo et al. (2009) . The
microanaerobic zone was suitable as a habitat for anaerobic
microorganisms.
As shown in Table S1 , the microbial community in ﬂuenced the
relationship between microorganisms and the carrier. During bio-
ﬁlm formation, the proliferation rates of microorganisms attached
to the bio ﬁlm may be mainly affected by the carrier and available
carbon sources ( Zhao et al., 2019 ). Therefore, in the aerobic deni-
triﬁcation system supported by the 1,4-PBS solid carbon source, the
bioﬁlm formation period (the adaptation period for aerobic deni-
trifying microorganisms) might be mainly determined by the car-
bon source and the carrier. In this study, 1,4-PBS promoted the
cellular growth of Proteobacteria members such as Curvibacter ,
Enterobacter ,Comamonas ,Diaphorobacter ,Azospira and Cloa-
cibacterium . The increase in the relative abundances ofTable 2

9microorganisms mentioned above improved the TN removal rate of
the reactor. According to Shen et al. (2016) , a packed-bed bioreactor
with 1,4-PBS as a microbial carrier showed a volumetric denitri ﬁ-
cation rate of 0.60 kg m/C03day/C01. The dominant bacteria were
Dechloromonas ,Alicycliphilus ,Azospira and Sinobacteraceae- uncul-
tured. These microbes belong to Proteobacteria , and their domi-
nance agreed with the results of this study. Thus, 1,4-PBS affects the
relative abundances of microorganisms belonging to Proteobacteria
and causes changes in reactor performance. In addition, a high
COD/N ratio is bene ﬁcial to the denitri ﬁcation process. However,
high denitri ﬁcation ef ﬁciency is also obtained with a low in ﬂuent
COD/N ratio ( Su et al., 2019 ). Compared with R1 (without a carrier),
R2 (with a 1,4-PBS carrier) exhibited signi ﬁcantly increased deni-
triﬁcation ef ﬁciency. Overall, microbial carriers of biodegradable
materials showed outstanding denitri ﬁcation performance ( Liu
et al., 2018 ;Peng et al., 2006 ). The material 1,4-PBS is a suitable
microbe carrier and aerobic denitri ﬁcation solid carbon source. The
microbial denitri ﬁcation pathway mainly depends on the conver-
sion rates of nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation ( Peng et al., 2006 ).
Initially, the bio ﬁlm on the 1,4-PBS carrier had not yet formed, and a
high DO led to a faster growth rate for NOB than AOB ( Yao and Peng,
2017 ), resulting in less NO 2/C0-N accumulation. According to Shen
et al. (2016) , PBS could be utilized as solid carbon source andbioﬁlm carrier for nitrate removal. The result showed that PBS
manifested a promising denitri ﬁcation performance. The volu-
metric denitri ﬁcation rate was 0.60 kg m/C03day/C01at the NO 3/C0-N
loading rate of 0.63 kg m/C03day/C01, and the average NO 2/C0-N con-
centration was below 0.20 mg L/C01. The removal of NO 3/C0-N is mainly
through denitri ﬁcation, which showed that the PBS carrier can
promote the denitri ﬁcation reaction. AOB bacteria are adapted to
survive in an environment with a DO concentration of
0.2e1.5 mg L/C01(Mohammed et al., 2014 ), while NOB bacteria are
adapted to survive in an environment with a dissolved oxygen
concentration of 1.2 e1.5 mg L/C01(Almstrand et al., 2011 ). In the
system, ammonia oxidation requires a DO concentration of
1.5 mg L/C01or even higher, while the DO concentration required for
the accumulation of nitrite is 0.3 e0.7 mg L/C01. Therefore, when the
system is operated under low dissolved oxygen conditions for a
long time, the accumulation rate of nitrite would be destroyed, and
the abundance and activity of NOB bacteria would be inhibited. The
DO concentration of 1,4PBS-SBR reactor is between 1.0 and
2.5 mg L/C01, and denitri ﬁcation was the main way of denitri ﬁcation
in 1,4PBS-SBR system. After 45 days of operation, the removal rate
of TN in 1,4PBS-SBR reactor was gradually increased. This shows
that in the 1,4PBS-SBR reactor was an anaerobic and hypoxia
microenvironment on the PBS carrier. This provided a living

10environment for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. As the amount of
carbon source released from 1,4-PBS increased, the bio ﬁlm on the
1,4-PBS gradually formed. This caused the DO distribution on the
surface of the 1,4-PBS carrier to change. Eventually, accumulation of
NO2eN enhanced the SND process. According to Liu et al. (2018) ,
during the limited aeration phase of PBS carrier reactor, the TN
removal rate in the anammox process reached 11%, but decreased
to 6% during the full aeration phase. The PBS carrier provided a
place for the colonization of different microorganisms. so that
denitrifying microorganisms with different functions coexist on the
PBS carrier. This function can be used for different microbial deni-
triﬁcation processes that require different content of dissolved
oxygen.
4. Conclusions
The material 1,4-PBS is a suitable carrier for the growth of aer-
obic denitrifying bacteria and can enhance the TN removal per-
centage by 16.3%. Due to the added 1,4-PBS carrier, the EPS content
increased from 216.33 g g/C01VSS to 416.33 g g/C01VSS. The 1,4-PBS
carrier gradually stabilized bio ﬁlms, increased the abundances of
more microbes and diversity, and changed the microbial commu-
nity structure. Furthermore, the relative abundances of Curvibacter,
Enterobacter, Comamonas, Cupriavidus and Azospira increased. 3D-
EEM spectra indicated that protein-like and humic acid-like sub-
stances were the main components of SMPs, and their peak in-
tensities increased in the initial 31 days and then decreased in the
following 14 days. The study of the PBS carrier affect the microbial
community structure and performance of denitri ﬁcation enhanced
bring insight into the role of the aerobic denitrifying bacteria in SBR
reactor.
