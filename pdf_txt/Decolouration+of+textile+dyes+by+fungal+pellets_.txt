Abstract
A white-rot basidiomycete, isolated from decayed acacia wood (from Northwest of Tunisia) and identiﬁed as Trametes trogii , was selected in a
broad plate screening because of its ability to degrade commercial dyes. In liquid cultures using a glucose–peptone medium, the sole ligninolyticactivity detected was laccase. The highest laccase levels were obtained in presence of CuSO
4as inducer (around 20000 U/l). Two isoenzymes,
were puriﬁed using anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatographies. Both isoenzymes are monomeric proteins, with Mwaround 62 kDa and
isoelectric points of 4.3 and 4.5, showing similar stability at pH and temperature, optimum pH and substrate speciﬁcity. The highest oxidationrate was obtained at pH 2 and 2.5 for ABTS and DMP, respectively. They were stable up to 50
◦C for 24 h and the stability was higher at alkaline
pH. Activity increased by the addition of 10 mM Ni, Mo or Mn but it was not affected by Cd, Al, Li and Ca. Identical N-terminal sequences weredetermined in both laccases. The crude enzyme, as well as the puriﬁed laccase, was able to decolorize dyes from the textile industry.© 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
White rot fungi are believed to be the most effective lignin-
degrading microbes in nature. They produce different kinds ofextracellular oxidoreductases, including laccases [26], peroxi-
dases [10] and oxidases producing H
2O2[18]. These enzymes
are involved in the degradation of lignin [20], but also of
other aromatic recalcitrant compounds causing environmen-tal problems. Both laccases and peroxidases can catalyze theone-electron oxidation of aromatic lignin units, resulting in var-ious non-enzymatic reactions. The peroxidases have the highestredox potential, being able to catalyze directly the oxidation ofnon-phenolic compounds. However, the use of oxygen (a non-limiting electron acceptor) by the laccases makes these enzymesmore adequate for industrial and environmental applications.

E-mail address: mjmartinez@cib.csic.es (M.J. Mart ´ınez).Laccase is an enzyme secreted by the most of the lignin
degrading basidiomycetes [23] and it has been reported as an
essential enzyme for lignin degradation in fungi without per-oxidases [15]. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of a wide
number of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines but itssubstrate range have been extended to non-phenolic compoundsin the presence of low molecular mass compounds acting asmediators [5,14] . Most of the studies have been carried out with
laccases from eukaryotes, principally with enzymes secretedby basidiomycetes being their distribution in prokaryotes morerecently reported [7].
The textile industry, by far the most avid user of synthetic
dyes, is in need of ecologically efﬁcient solutions for its coloredefﬂuents. Wastewaters from textile industries are a complex mix-ture of many polluting substances such as organochlorine-basedpesticides, heavy metals, pigments and dyes. Dye efﬂuents arepoorly decolorized by conventional biological wastewater treat-ments and may be toxic for the microorganisms present in thetreatment plants due to their complex aromatic structures. Fur-thermore, following anaerobic digestion, nitrogen-containingdyes are transformed into aromatic amines that are more toxicand mutagenic than the parent molecules. To overcome these

difﬁculties, and taking into account the broad substrate speci-
ﬁcity of white-rot fungi (WRF) to degrade aromatic compounds,these fungi and their ligninolytic enzymes are being investi-gated for their potential application in textile efﬂuent treatments.Among them, the most widely studied is the white-rot fungiPhanerochaete chrysosporium , producing two kind of peroxi-
dases, lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP)in ligninolytic conditions and a multicopper oxidase only whencellulose is present as carbon source. This fungus requires theaddition of oxygen to the cultures to carry out the degradativeprocess, but other fungi being able to degrade pollutants underenvironmental conditions could be more promising. This is thecase of Trametes versicolor , which produces a high level of lac-
case, and is being studied for industrial applications [2].
Trametes trogii , a worldwide distributed white-rot basid-
iomycete, is also another example. It has been demonstrated tobe a good producer of laccases and other ligninolytic enzymesincluding LiP and MnP [12,23,27,30] . This fungus was also
shown to be efﬁcient tool for the degradation of several organicpollutants including nitrobenzene and anthracene [29], PCB
mixture (Aroclor 1150) and an industrial PAH mixture (10%V/V of PAHs, principal components hexaethylbenzene, naph-thalene, 1-methyl naphthalene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, ﬂu-orene and phenanthrene) [19].
Since the enzymatic system secreted by basidiomycetes
depends of the kind of fungus, the strain and the culture con-ditions, more white-rot fungi have to be screened for theirability to degrade recalcitrant aromatic compounds, includingdyes present in industrial efﬂuents causing environmental prob-lems. In this paper, we isolated a promising fungal strain fromthe north of Tunisia, identiﬁed as a Trametes (=Funalia )trogii
strain, able to oxidize ABTS and to decolorize the commercialdye Poly R478. We characterized the laccase produced by thisstrain, the single ligninolytic enzyme secreted by this fungus inthe studied conditions, and studied its role in the decolorizationof some textile dyes.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Chemicals
2,2/prime-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate (ABTS) and 2,6-
dimethoxyphenol (DMP) were from Sigma–Aldrich, H 2O2(Perhydrol, 30%)
was obtained from Boehringer, aromatic compounds were from Sigma–Aldrichor Fluka. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. The azo dyesNeolane blue, Neolane pink Neolane yellow and Maxilon blue and the indigoiddyes Basacryl yellow and Bezaktiv S-BF turquoise, were provided by theinstitute of textile at Ksar Helal, Tunisia.
2.2. Media and culture conditions
The solid medium used for isolation of the fungal strains contained per liter:
10 g of malt extract, 4 g of yeast extract, 4 g of glucose and 20 g of agar. ThepH was adjusted to 5.5 with 2N NaOH. For the detection of ligninolytic activitythe fungi were grown on malt–agar plates supplemented with 0.5 mM ABTS orPoly R478.
For laccase production and induction studies, 3.0 ml of homogenized
mycelium were used for inoculation of 1000-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing300 ml of culture medium. This basal medium contained (per liter): glucose,10 g; peptone, 5 g; yeast extract, 1 g; ammonium tartrate, 2 g; KH
2PO4,1 g ;MgSO 4·7H2O, 0.5 g; KCl, 0.5 g; trace elements solution, 1 ml. The trace ele-
ments solution composition per liter was as follow: B 4O7Na2·10H 2O, 0.1 g;
CuSO 4·5H2O, 0.01 g; FeSO 4·7H2O, 0.05 g; MnSO 4·7H2O; 0.01; ZnSO 4·7H2O,
0.07 g; (NH4) 6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.01 g. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.5.
Cultures were incubated at 30◦C on a rotary shaker (160 rpm). Basal medium
was supplemented with CuSO 4·5H2O (0–600 /H9262M) and ethanol (3% V/V) as
inducer of laccases and MnSO 4·4H2O (150 /H9262M) was added as inducers of MnP.
2.3. Isolation of the fungal strain
The fungus used in this study was isolated in 2003 from decaying acacia
wood in the vicinity of Bousalem, Northwest of Tunisia. The selected strain,denominated B6J, was identiﬁed by the Spanish culture collection of microor-ganisms as T. trogii and selected by their capability to oxidize ABTS in solid
medium and decolorize Poly R478. The culture was maintained on 2% maltextract agar plates grown at 30
◦C and stored at 4◦C.
2.4. Enzyme assays and analysis of protein
Laccase activity was assayed using 10 mM DMP in 100 mM sodium tar-
trate buffer, pH 5 ( /H9255469= 27,500 M−1cm−1, referred to DMP concentration)
[40]. Mn-oxidizing peroxidase activity was estimated by the formation of Mn3+-
tartrate complex ( /H9255238: 6500 M−1cm−1) during the oxidation of 0.1 mM Mn2+
(MnSO 4) in 100 mM sodium tartrate buffer (pH 5) in the presence of 0.1 mM
H2O2. LiP activity was determined by the H 2O2-dependent veratraldehyde (3,4-
dimethoxybenzaldehyde) formation ( /H9255310= 9300 M−1cm−1) from 2 mM vera-
tryl alcohol (3,4-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol) in 100 mM sodium tartrate buffer(pH 3) in the presence of 0.4 mM H
2O2. Aryl-alcohol oxidase activity was also
estimated by veratraldehyde formation from 5 mM veratryl alcohol in 100 mMphosphate buffer, pH 6 [18].
The enzymatic reactions were carried out at room temperature (22–25
◦C)
and one unit of enzyme activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme oxidizing1/H9262mol of substrate min
−1. Extracellular protein was determined by the Bradford
method, using Bio-Rad protein assay and bovine serum albumin as standard.
2.5. Laccase puriﬁcation
Laccase from T. trogii was puriﬁed from basal medium with 150 /H9262M CuSO 4.
The culture liquid from 10 days was separated from mycelia by ﬁltration onWhatman paper, concentrated and dialyzed against 10 mM tartrate buffer (pH5.5) by ultraﬁltration (Filtron, 3-kDa cutoff membrane). Samples of 50 ml of thiscrude enzyme preparation were applied to a Hitrap Q FF cartridge (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer at a ﬂow rate of 1.5 ml min
−1. The
retained proteins were eluted over 100 min using the following NaCl gradient:0 to 400 mM, 60 min; 400 to 1000 mM, 30 min and 1000 mM 10 min.
Fractions with laccase activity were pooled, concentrated (Filtron Microsep,
3-kDa cutoff), and samples of 0.2 ml were applied to a Superdex 75 (Phar-macia HR 10/30) column equilibrated with 10 mM sodium tartrate buffer, pH5.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, at a ﬂow rate of 0.4 ml min
−1. The laccase peak
was pooled, concentrated (Filtron Microsep, 3-kDa cutoff), dialyzed against10 mM sodium tartrate buffer, pH 5.5, and 1 ml samples applied to a Mono-Qanion-exchange column (Pharmacia HR 5/5) equilibrated with the same buffer.Retained proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 120 mMover 30 min, at a ﬂow rate of 0.8 ml min
−1.
2.6. Properties of puriﬁed laccases
The molecular mass of the laccase was determined by SDS/PAGE and gel
ﬁltration. SDS/PAGE was performed with 12% polyacrylamide gels, using high-molecular-mass standards (Bio-Rad) ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin(66.2 kDa) and phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), /H9252-galactosidase (116.25 kDa), and
Myosin (200 kDa). Isoelectricfocusing was performed on 5% polyacrylamidegels with a thickness of 1 mm and a pH gradient from 2.5 to 5.5 [38] (deter-
mined using a contact electrode). Zymograms were obtained using 10 mM DMPin 100 mM sodium tartrate buffer, pH 5, after washing the gels for 10 min withthe same buffer. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250.Gel ﬁltration was carried out on Superdex 75, calibrated with aldolase (158 kDa),H. Zouari-Mechichi et al. / Enzyme and Microbial T echnology 39 (2006) 141–148 143
albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa) and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), to deter-
mine the molecular mass of native protein. N-terminal sequence of laccase wasdetermined by automated Edman degradation of 5 /H9262g of protein in an Applied
Biosystem protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Procise 494). The UV-visible spec-trum of the puriﬁed laccase was recorded in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH6.5. The effect of temperature on laccase stability was investigated in sodiumtartrate buffer pH 4, whereas pH stability and optimum pH were determined incitrate–borate-phosphate buffer (pH range between 2.0–11).
2.7. Substrate speciﬁcity
Substrate speciﬁcity was qualitatively studied by the changes in the absorp-
tion spectra of reaction mixtures with phenolic and non-phenolic aromaticcompounds, which contained 0.5 mM substrate, 130 mU ml
−1puriﬁed laccase,
and 100 mM sodium tartrate buffer, pH 4. These compounds are listed in Table 2 .
Kinetic constants for ABTS were calculated in 100 mM sodium tar-
trate buffer, pH 4. The molar extinction coefﬁcient for ABTS was/H9255
436= 29,300 M−1cm−1.
2.8. Decolorization of textile dyes
To test the ability of the fungal culture to decolorize industrial dyes, six
different dyes were solubilized in water, membrane-ﬁltered through a 0.45 /H9262m
cellulose nitrate ﬁlter and mixed with the malt extract agar medium, previouslyautoclaved (ﬁnal concentration of 50 mg l
−1). After three weeks of incubation,
dye decolorization was determined qualitatively for each dye by comparing colorin the inoculated plates with that of plates containing the medium and the dyes,without the fungus.
Decolorization of textile dyes was investigated also by the crude and puriﬁed
laccase (Lac I). The reaction mixture (5 ml) contained 100 mM sodium tartratebuffer pH 5, dye (50 mg l
−1) and laccase (0.5 U ml−1). The reaction was initiated
with enzyme and incubated at 30◦C. Samples were withdrawn at 4 h intervals and
subsequently analyzed. Spectra were recorded between 200 and 800 nm using aShimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer. The dyes partially or non-decolorized bylaccase were tested in the presence of 0.5 mM HBT (1-hydroxybenzotriazole),a common laccase mediator, to increase the oxidative effect of the enzyme.
3. Results
3.1. Isolation of fungal strain and production of
ligninolytic activity in liquid medium
Screening of local fungi for ligninolytic activities was per-
formed using samples of decayed wood collected from a forestin the north west of Tunisia. A high number of fungal strainswere isolated on malt extract–agar medium, and screened forenzyme production using the same medium supplemented withABTS or Poly R478. The strain B6J, identiﬁed as T. trogii, was
chosen because it exhibited a fast and large oxidation of ABTSon agar plates, as demonstrated by the dark green color appearedin the plates.
The production of extracellular laccase and peroxidase activ-
ities, proteins and reducing sugars was studied in this T. trogii
strain, in the presence of different enzyme inducers. Low lac-case activity was detected in the absence of Mn
2+or Cu2+in the
cultures. The presence of Mn2+in the basal medium increased
slightly the laccase activity levels, but the higher induction wasobtained in presence of Cu
2+in the basal medium. The presence
of ethanol in these cultures did not increase laccase activity.MnP, LiP, and aryl-alcohol oxidase were not detected in any ofthe conditions assayed.

The effect of different Cu2+concentration on T. trogii laccase
production is shown in Fig. 1 . Maximal laccase activity and
proteins were obtained with 300 /H9262M CuSO 4, decreasing this
activity when the Cu2+concentration was higher. Zymograms
after isoelectrofocusing of crude enzyme preparations obtainedfrom cultures carried out in the absence of Cu
2+resulted in
two laccase activity bands, a major band and a minor band. Thezymograms from Cu
2+-induced cultures showed that the induced
protein corresponded to the major protein band after staining thegel with Coomassie blue R-250 (data not shown).
Partial characterization of the laccase in the crude prepara-
tion, to optimize the puriﬁcation process, showed an optimal pHaround 4. This activity was stable in the crude at pH 7 at roomtemperature for 24 h, but retained more than 50% of its activityat pH 5. The laccase in the crude extract was also stable for 24 hat 50
◦C however, it lost more than 90% of its activity at 60◦C.
3.2. Puriﬁcation of the laccases
Two proteins with laccase activity were puriﬁed to homo-
geneity from the basal medium supplemented with 150 Cu2+.
Table 1 summarizes the results obtained from 10-days old cul-
ture. During the ﬁrst chromatographic step (Q-Cartridge) thelaccase activity was separated from most impurities, whichinclude a brown pigment absorbing strongly at 280 nm ( Fig. 2 A).
During the ﬁltration chromatography (Superdex 75), laccaseactivity was detected as a symmetrical peak separated of other144 H. Zouari-Mechichi et al. / Enzyme and Microbial T echnology 39 (2006) 141–148

LacI and LacII had been puriﬁed 31 and 11-fold, respectively.
The molecular masses of both proteins LacI and LacII were
58 kDa as estimated by gel ﬁltration chromatography and 62 kDaas determined by SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 3 a). These results suggest that
both enzymes are monomeric proteins.
Analytical isoelectric focusing showed a pI of 4.3 for LacII
and 4.5 for LacI ( Fig. 3 b). The N-terminal amino acid sequences
of LacI and LacII were identical: SIGPV ADLTISNGA VSPDGF.Both puriﬁed laccases showed the optimum activity, estimatedin 100 mM tartrate buffer, at pH 2.5 and 3 for the oxidations ofABTS and DMP, respectively.
3.3. Substrate speciﬁcity of T. trogii laccase
The substrate speciﬁcity of both laccases obtained from the
T. trogii cultures supplemented with 300 /H9262MC u
2+, was qualita-
tively studied on different phenolic and non-phenolic aromaticcompounds ( Table 2 ). Both laccases present similar activity on
the studied substrates. They are able to oxidize substituted phe-nols, catechol, phenolic aldehydes and acids. No activity wasobserved on, phenol, chloro-substituted phenols, and the non-phenolic aromatic compounds ( Table 2 ). The kinetic studies
were carried out using ABTS as substrate ( Table 3 ). The results
showed signiﬁcant differences in the K
mand kcatof Lac I and
Lac II but similar efﬁciency to oxidize this substrate.H. Zouari-Mechichi et al. / Enzyme and Microbial T echnology 39 (2006) 141–148 145

3.4. Decolorization of textile dyes
The ability of T. trogii strain B6J to decolorize textile dyes
was tested ﬁrst on solid media. The decolorization was possiblein the presence and in the absence of Cu
2+, although it was faster
when Cu2+was present in the medium. The fungus grew well
in the plates and decolorized the dyes Neolane blue, Neolaneyellow, Neolane pink and Bezaktiv S-BF turquoise but a slowgrowth was obtained on the plates containing Basacryl yellowand Maxilon blue and no decolorization was obtained for thesedyes, either in the presence of Cu.
Similar results were obtained with the crude enzyme and
the puriﬁed laccase ( Table 4 ). Neolane blue and Neolane pink
were completely decolorized after 24 h of treatments. The dyesNeolane yellow and Bezaktiv S-BF turquoise were only par-Table 4

was detected after 4 days of treatments for Basacryl yellow andMaxilon blue.
The dyes not decolorized by the laccase, and the Neolane
yellow, partially decolorized by this enzyme, were tested in thepresence of HBT as laccase mediator ( Table 4 ). The results show
that the addition of mediator increased the decolorization ofNeolane yellow, being complete after 24 h of incubation, Max-ilon blue was partially decolorized in this conditions (4 days ofincubation) and no effect was detected on Basacryl yellow afterlaccase-mediator treatment.
4. Discussion
The T. trogii strain isolated from the north of Tunisia, which
was able to oxidize ABTS and decolorize the commercial dyePoly R478, secreted only laccase in the conditions studied, eventhough peroxidase inducers were added to the culture medium.The presence of Mn
2+increase slightly the laccase activity levels
in the cultures, but no Mn2+-oxizidizing activity was detected.
The addition of Cu2+produced the strongest laccase induction.
These results are in agreement with that reported for other T.
trogii strains [29].
Although it has been reported that the presence of ethanol
in the cultures can increase laccase production in some basid-iomycetes [22,32,33] , the addition of ethanol to the copper
supplemented cultures in T. trogii did not produce a signiﬁ-
cant effect. Copper induction has been reported in other fungallaccases, including the laccases secreted by different Trametes
species [16,17,35] and in the case of T. versicolor , it has been
described the regulation by copper of laccase gene at the tran-scription level [9].I nt h e T. trogii strain isolated in Tunisia, the
addition of CuSO
4to basal medium enhanced more than 80-fold
the laccase activity at 150 /H9262M copper. The best results were
obtained in presence of 300 /H9262M copper (100-fold more than
basal medium) but higher concentration produced a decrease146 H. Zouari-Mechichi et al. / Enzyme and Microbial T echnology 39 (2006) 141–148

Although it has been described laccases with two sub-
units from Trametes villosa [41], laccases from basidiomycetes,
including Trametes species, are generally monomeric protein
with a molecular mass between 50 and 80 kDa [28,40] . The two
laccases puriﬁed from T. trogii are monomeric proteins with the
same molecular mass (62 kDa), but a small difference in the pIvalues have permitted their separation in Mono-Q column. Com-pared to the laccases of other T. trogii strains, the laccases from
our strain has a molecular mass close to most laccases exceptthat of strain 201 [17], and one isoenzyme from strain BAFC
463[28] which were 70 kDA and 38 kDa, however the pI of the
two isoenzymes from our strain were less acid than all the otherlaccases from T. trogii strains ( Table 5 ).
The N-terminal sequence of new T. trogii laccases was
the same for both puriﬁed proteins. The 20 residues analyzedshowed 100% identity with laccases from Basidiomycete PM1[8]and Basidiomycete C30 (formerly Marasmius quercophilus
reclassiﬁed as a Trametes species [11,25] , but only 85% identity
with T. trogii strain 201 [17] (Table 5 ).
The comparison of the N-terminal sequence of the laccases
from T trogii strain B6J with those of laccases from other white-
rot fungi showed 85% identity with laccases from T. versicolor
[4], 80% with laccases from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and P.
coccineus [13,21] , and 75% with Phlebia radiata and Coriolop-
sis rigida laccases [37,38] .
As a typical laccase, the enzyme secreted by T. trogii showed
no activity on tyrosine and had a wide substrate speciﬁcity oxi-dizing hydroxy- and methoxy-substituted phenols. The kineticstudy on ABTS showed a high afﬁnity of T. trogii laccase on
this substrate, in the same order that P . coccineus and C. rigida
laccases [21,38] and higher than laccases from Pleurotus eryn-
gii. Differences in afﬁnity of this substrate could be related with
the redox potential of these enzymes and its role in the degra-dation of recalcitrant compounds present contaminated soils orresidual wastewater [22].The ability of white-rot fungi to decolorize synthetic textile
dyes has been widely studied, particularly with P . chrysospo-
rium and T. versicolor [3]. The role of laccases and peroxidases
secreted by these fungi is controversial although, in the case of P.
chysosporium only peroxidases seem to be involved in the pro-
cess
[33].I n Trametes species laccases are the major enzymes but
peroxidases also are secreted during dye decolorization [24,31] .
The ability of T. trogii to decolorize industrial dyes was
demonstrated in several studies as reported by Apohan and Yesi-lada[1], Cing and Yesilada [6], Levin et al. [30], Ozsoy et al [35],
¨Unyayar et al. [39] and Yesilada et al. [42,43] .
Textile dyes Drimarene blue X3LR, Remazol brilliant blue
R, Astrazon blue and red, orange II, Ponceau 2R (a xylidinederivative), malachite green, anthraquinone blue, and ReactiveBlack 5 (RB5) were used to study the ability of T. trogii to
decolorize textile dyes. In most of these studies the culture orthe fungal pellet of T trogii were used however no studies using
puriﬁed laccase were reported. Our study is the ﬁrst to report theuse of puriﬁed laccase from Trametes trogii.
The T. trogii strain isolated in Tunisia was able to decol-
orize Poly R 478 in the agar-plates and Cu
2+addition stimulated
decolorization, suggesting that laccase could be involved inthe process. The results on dye decolorization with the crudeenzyme, without peroxidase activity, also indicated that laccaseis the enzyme involved in the process. The results obtained withthe puriﬁed enzyme were similar to those obtained with the crudeenzyme, conﬁrming that T. trogii laccase decolorizes industrial
dyes.
Dye decolorization with the fungal culture and the crude and
puriﬁed laccase show the different nature of the industrial dyes.Probably an inhibitory effect of the dyes Maxillon blue andBasacryl yellow, at the assayed concentration, are the responsi-ble of the low growth obtained in the agar-plates in the presenceof these industrial dyes. The similar results obtained with crudeand puriﬁed laccase conﬁrmed the role of the enzyme in dyedecolorization. The presence of laccase mediator in the processincreased the range and rate of decolorization. This effect hasH. Zouari-Mechichi et al. / Enzyme and Microbial T echnology 39 (2006) 141–148 147
been also reported using laccase from Coriolopsis gallica [36]
and Trametes modesta [34].
The ability of Trametes species to decolorize different dyes
is evident, but the advantage of laccase treatment is a shortertreatment period. The T. trogii isolated from Tunisia is a promis-
ing fungal strain since it produces a high laccase levels in thestudied conditions. Currently, the optimization of laccase pro-duction from this fungal strain is being studied and industrialdyes efﬂuents from Tunisia textile industry are being treatedwith the enzyme to check its potential use in decolorization anddetoxiﬁcation of the efﬂuents.
