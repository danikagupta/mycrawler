1. INTRODUCTION  
This research work is investigated in the treatment of colour removal using natural adsorbent. Several papers in 
the literature presented the principles of Textile Dye Treatment and assessments of physical, chemical and 
biological procedures employing Advanced Oxidation Processes. This work presents a thorough overview of 
advanced oxidation processes  (AOPs) on textile wastewater treatment throughout the last two decades, including 
their performances, mechanisms, benefits, drawbacks, influencing variables, and electrical energy per order 
(EEO) needs [1].  Rapid industrialisation in recent years has increased pollution discharge into the environment 
[2]. Water contamination is caused by the disposal of municipal and other industrial pollutants into bodies of 
water [ 3]. A typical mill in India that produces 60*104 m of fabric releases roughly 1.5 million litres of wastewater 
per day. Alternative cost -effective colour removal techniques based on microbiological processes have been

 investigated, although with limited applicability and effectiveness [ 4]. The textile industry requires a large volume 
of water for their process. The effluent from textile is an important source of dye pollution. Textile dyes are 
complex aromatic organic compounds that are designed to resist fading when subjected to perspiration, light, 
water, a variety of oxidising and reducing agents. Microbial assault. Their uses in the textile  industry vary 
depending on the kind of fabric created (cotton, silk, rayon, wool, and so on). According to reports, the global 
dye annual market is roughly 7*105 tonnes per yea r. The dyes are soluble organic chemicals classes as direct, 
reactive, acidic, or basic. Dyes have a high solubility in water, making them more difficult to remove using 
traditional methods [ 5]. The industrial dyes are hazardous in nature so proper treatment is needed. Because of 
their impact on ground and surface water, as well as h uman health, industrial pollution constitutes one of the most 
serious environmental issues  [5].  
 
For the treatment of dye industrial wastewater, many methods such as enhanced oxidation, membrane filtration, 
microbial technologies, bio electrochemical degr adation, and photocatalytic degradation have been documented 
[6]. The dyeing method include colouring the materials and treating it with dye. Temperature and time are the 
two most important parameters in this operation. Both printing and dyeing wastewater contain waste elements. 
Reducers (sulphide), dyestuff, soap, mordant, acetic acids, metal salts, cationic compounds, and surfactants, and 
chromophores are released during the dyeing process . Orange peel is largely composed of cellulose pectin, hemi 
cellulo se, lignin and other low molecular weight compounds including lime stone. In the textile manufacturing 
sector, the finishing process converts knitted or woven material into useable material with higher quality and 
specific features such as waterproofing an d smoothness. This last technique contributes significantly to water 
contamination. The present study is to explore the feasibility of orange peel as a low -cost natural adsorbent with 
respect to various parameters such as colour adsorbent capacity of mater ial with initial concentration at different 
doses, time and pH. The study shows that material as good potential for the removal of colour from textile effluent 
[7]. 
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
2.1.SAMPLE AND ADSORBENT COLLECTION  
 
The sample wastewater was collected from the dyeing industry. The sample contains three different reactive dyes 
like golden yellow, Black B and red 6L. The adsorbent used for this study is orange peel. Orange peels were 
collected from local fruit stall.  
 
2.1.2 PREPARATION OF ABSORB ENT  
 
Orange peel were selected and washed with water for several times to remove ash and other contaminants, 
followed by double distilled water (DDW) washing. The washed peels were left to dry at ambient temperature for 
36 hrs, then crushed and sieve to sm all particles (3.35 mm sieve) [8]. © 2023 JETIR January 2023, Volume 10, Issue 1                                                            www.jetir.org (ISSN -2349 -5162)

 2.2 PREPARATION OF TEXTILE EFFLUENTS  
 
A synthetic textile effluent by dissolving  dye in  waste water is prepare d. With known concentration of 1000  ppm 
dye solution is prepared by dissolving 1gm of dye in 1 litre. To that sample different weight of adsorbent is added 
and allowed for a period of time with continuous shaking. The samples are collected and the concentration of the 
dye solution is analysed by UV spectrophotometers [9]. 
 
3. BATCH ADSORPTION STUDY  
 
In this experi ment, a batch adsorption technique was used. Study of effects of various important parameters such 
as amount of adsorbent, pH values, the contact time between adsorbate and adsorbent. 100 ml of sample waste 
water was taken in flask. A desired amount of ads orbent then added to sample. The experiment was carried out 
at room temperature. Samples were withdrawn from the stirrer at different time intervals. then the adsorbent was 
separated from the sample using filter paper. The adsorbents were measured using su itable UV spectroscopy [10]. 
Then the final concentration of dye was estimated.   
 
4. SPECTROMETERS:  
 
It is used to evaluate metals to determine the chemical composition with very high accuracy. The instrument 
measures the properties of light over a specifi c section of the electromagnetic spectrum. The role of the 
spectrometer is to measure the interaction (absorption, reflection, scattering. In this research work UV 
spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy is used [11]. 
 
4.1 UV SPECTROSCOPY  
 
The principal of U V-visible SPECTROSCOPY is based on the absorption of ultra violet light or visible length by 
chemical compound which result is the production of distinct spectra is based on the interaction between the light 
and matter UV visible spectroscopy is used in an alytical chemistry for the quantitative determination of analytes 
such as torsion metal iron highly conjugated organic compound and biological macro molecules. This technique 
is used for multiple sample types including liquids, solids, thin films and glass . This UV spectroscopy is used in 
water treatment for the removal of dyes in industrial waste water using various adsorbent [11].

Theory utilizes the concept that molecular absorb the specific frequency of the light that are characteristics of the 
corresponding structure of the molecules. Infrared is the measurement of the interaction of infrared radiation with 
melted by absorption r eflection. IR is used to study and identify chemical substance are functional groups in solid, 
liquid or gaseous in form. This UV spectroscopy is used in prediction of concentration of salts in waste water [12].  
 
5. RESULT AND DISCUSSION  
 
5.1 Effect of s ynthetic absorbent:  
 
Effects of concentration time on absorption were studied and results are shown. This figure shows that, increase 
in removal efficiency with increase in time between adsorbate and absorbent. It can be attributed to the fact that 
more time becomes available for the dye to make an attraction complex with orange peels. Concentration prepares 
a known amount of dye solution byceing dye, take 100 ml of textile waste water in different flask of known 
concentration 100 ml/1 litre, add 0.3 gm, 0.6gm, 0.9gm and 1.2gm of orange peel in different flask, the colour 
removed from 0 min, 10min, 20 min, 30 min were noted.  pH values also analysed and graph has been showed, 
by continuous shaking, the dyes are removed by using orange peel. Finally, the percentage of colour remo ved is 
calculated. From this it was found that as the amount of absorbent is increased the % of colour removed decreases 
from 100% to 36 % [13].

5.3 Effects of pH  
  
The pH of the solution significantly affects the absorption of dyes by orange peels. At average pH, the more 
effective dye absorption capacity of orange peels was observed. The optimum absorption capacity was achieved 
at pH 7 [16,17] . At lower pH, functional oxidized groups of the peels are promoted and thus active site of orange 
peels for binding of dye become less available, as a result removal efficiency decreases. The pH content is 
analysed with 0.25ppm, 0.5 ppm, 0.7 5 ppm, 1 ppm for the above sample solution. The initial and final values are 
calculated. For the above concentration (ppm) the initial value is same as 8.5 ppm. The final value changes with 
concentration as 7.8, 7.7, 7.6, 7.5 [18].

6. CONCLUSION:  
 
From this research, dye adsorption may be used to remove different dyes from textile waste water. In 
terms of environmental awareness and economics, this study was carried out to identify one of the natural waste 
materials that may  be used as an adsorbent for colour textile effluents. Orange peel (OP), which was thrown as a 
waste item from a fruit stand, has a high potential for removing anionic dyes from coloured textile effluent. The 
adsorption of dyes onto orange peels is control led by pH, the amount of adsorbents, and the contact time. The pH 
value has a significant impact on adsorption efficiency, with low pH values exhibiting comparatively high 
adsorption efficiency. A batch adsorption investigation was carried out for  the removal of colour from textile 
effluent. Adsorbents are particularly effective in decolorized textile effluent. The removal of dye by orange peel 
as an adsorbent has been examined at various flow rates (contact duration), concentrations, and pH. It has been 
discovered that lowering flow and altering concentration promotes dye adsorption. The experimental results are 
properly documented, according to the findings of this study. Orange peels are not significantly more expensive 
than other bio adsorbents, a nd they are widely accessible. Significant colour removal may be accomplished with 
this inexpensive and environmentally friendly adsorbent. With the experimental data collected from this work, it 
is feasible to build and optimise an affordable treatment pr ocedure for dye removal from industrial effluents . 0123456789
