abstract
This study focuses on the investigation of adsorptive behavior of Cu, Ni, and Zn ions by 
Archontophoenix alexandrae in single metal system (SMS), bi-metal system (BMS), and tri-metal sys-
tem (TMS). This was done through a novel strategy by combining factorial design (FD), response surface methodology (RSM), and mixture design (MD). The adsorption study was carried out as 
a function of pH, contact time, and biomass dosage and validated through screening design. To 
improve adsorption capacities of metallic ions, RSM and MD involving central composite design and simplex lattice design were used. The experimental designs demonstrated the maximum adsorption 
capacity for Cu. The existence of Cu ions suppressed the adsorption of Ni and Zn ions. Langmuir 
isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model best explain the adsorption kinet-ics of Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) metal ions on to A. alexandrae. The A. alexandrae could possibly be 
used as an efficient biosorbent for the removal of toxic pollutants from industrial effluents.

1. Introduction
The heavy metals are being discharged from various 
chemical industries including mining operations, elec-
tro-plating, refrigeration, stoneware, storage batteries, pigment production, and tanning. These metals contami-
nate the water bodies [1–7]. Ni, Cu, and Zn are the central 
metals present in industrial wastewater [8,9]. The different 
techniques that are extensively applied for the elimination 
of metal ions from polluted reservoirs are ion exchange, 
complexation, the solvent extraction process, phytoreme-
diation, membrane separation, chemical precipitation, and adsorption. All these methods are expensive and ineffective 
at the lower concentration of metals in aqueous streams. 
Biosorption is one of the most viable methods that are gen-
erally employed for the elimination of heavy metals from 
water sources [10–19].
Archontophoenix alexandrae is generally known as King 
Palm, Alexandrae palm, or Alex palm. Enormous quanti-ties of residues obtained from leaves and leaf sheaths are 
somewhere associated with the king palm production, with 
some variations according to species. These residues could possibly enlist as natural dietary stuff, however, no infor -
mation is available regarding chemical composition and 
application as a food ingredient of this material into the 
literature. The king palm has a strong environmental associ-
ation, as it lessens the stress over palmito industry and illic-
itly extracted species, that is, Euterpe edulis. Moreover, it can 
be easily cultivated. The chemical inspection, antioxidant 
prospective, and microstructure of A. alexandrae flour were 
documented [20]. The plant has a considerable amount of 
fiber with low ash content [21–25]. This plant is economical, 
eco-friendly, and easily accessible adsorbent since no major 
use is reported in Pakistan, so annually lot of waste is pro-
duced, which can be utilized for adsorption. Ni, Cu, and 
Zn which are commonly present in the industrial effluents 
are toxic for living organisms even at low concentrations 
[4,27–29]. The basic purpose of this study to remove these 
polluted metals from aqueous sources using biomaterials. 
Three experimental design techniques have been employed, 
that is, five-factor factorial deigns, response surface method-
ology (RSM) along with MD to recognize the distinctiveness 
of metal deduction from TMS using biosorption. FD meth-
odology was very helpful for viewing several factors to dis-
cover the prominent effects and interactions as well [30–32]. 
The majority of RSM utilized in poly systems was deliberated 
for optimization. The RSM method was employed to evaluate 
the biosorption results under a variety of metal composi-
tions leading toward ideal biosorption potential [33–35].
Moreover, metal-contaminated wastewater may be diluted 
prior to treatment if the concentration of metal ion is exces-
sively high. Thus, two MDs, standing for high as well as 
low on the metal dose by the same heavy metal compo-
nents, were offered in this activity to explore the effect of 
metal dosage on biosorption. The application of MD helped a lot in finding the interaction of the metal biosorption 
among three targeted metal ions. Triangular contour fig-
ures and three-dimensional surface graphs were created to 
explain the thrice metal biosorption statistics in MD scheme. 
By the study of respective designs, the number or quan-tity of experimental runs was reduced. While, quantitative explanation and prediction of the metal uptake activity of King palm biosorbent were also effectively clarified using isotherms (Langmuir and Freundlich) and kinetic study.
2. Material and methods
The King palm biomass used as a biosorbent mate-
rial was collected from region around Qadir bakhsh farm, 
Faisalabad, Pakistan. The leaves were removed from the 
plant stems, washed with high purity water; oven drying at 
about 70°C for 72 h, grinded by mechanical grinding mill. 
The biomass was sieved in order to obtain diverse particle 
ranges and then stored in air tight container till further use. All the analytical grade chemicals were employed for 
metal sorption. The stock solutions of 1,000 mg/L of Zn(II), 
Cu(II), and Ni(II) were formed in de-ionized water [28].
2.1. Batch experiments
The plant biomass was added in solutions compris-
ing relevant heavy metals and concentrations were set in 
accordance with the experimental design method. Every experiment was performed in 150 mL flask having 60 mL heavy metal ion solution. The pH of the solution was main-tained by the addition of HCl and NaOH solutions. The metal ions concentration was determined by atomic absorp-tion spectrometer. The percentage removal and quantity of adsorbed metal ions (q
e) were evaluated by Eqs. (1) and (2).

is the final concentration at equilibrium, V is the volume, and M is the mass of biosorbent (g). The concentrations of 
remaining metal ions were obtained by Hitachi polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer Z-8200.
2.2. Experimental design
Three experimental design methodologies, that is, FD, 
RSM, and MD were used to interpret the characteristics of 
metals removed from aqueous solution by A. alexandrae. All these designs were successfully computed by statistical 
software Design-Expert 9.0.5.1 (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, 
MN, USA).
This methodology has been used by many researchers 
for testing and separated major effects in testing variables [30–34,36–38]. A chain of factorial experiments is optimized 
for assessing main effects as well as interactions of factors. 
Minimum Run resolution IV screening Design (MRRIVSD) 
was applied in order to observe the contribution of required 
factors in removing heavy metal pollutants by King palm. In factorial technique five factors, that is, solution pH, agi-
tation speed, biomass dose, adsorption time, and initial 
metal ions concentration were selected to check the response 
of metal removal through biosorption. Every factor was 291 R.A. Khera et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 201 (2020) 289–300
characterized at two levels, that is, high and low, denoted 
by +1 and −1, respectively. The details of factors and their 
levels are recapitulated in Table 1. The two-level five factors 
FD were performed according to the above experimental 
conditions. For every factor, two levels were chosen one was low and the other was high.
RSM is typically applied for the optimization of exper -
imental treatments. RSM was employed to determine the 
collaboration of related heavy metals in the biosorption 
process. Additionally, the consequences of ternary metal biosorption were also predicted. Usually, there are numer -
ous design techniques can be selected, for instance, face-  
centered cube design (FCCD), Box–Behnken design plus 
central composite design (CCD). The FCCD, a modified 
edition of the CCD, was operated to acquire the experimen-tal information [32–34]. This FCCD comprised of 20 exper -
iments, signifying the six sockets on the six cubic surfaces, eight sockets on the eight vertices, plus six replications at 
the central point. Table 2 displays conditions for experimen-
tal conditions of RSM and MDs. There were total of five factors, that is, pH, time, concentration, agitation speed, 
and biosorbent dose. The initial concentration was taken 
from 60 to 120 mg/L containing dose 3 g/L at pH (5.5) and 
agitation speed of 150 rpm for about 12 h.
In response surface designs, each heavy metal ion con-
centration is independent from other two metals. Conversely, 
in MD, each metal ion was dependent upon each other and the computation of three metals was definite [39]. The inves-tigational factors in MD were the fraction of three metals. 
Simplex lattice design (SLD) is generally utilized to examine 
the elemental properties of the mixture. Consecutively, this 
research implemented amplified SLD through axial points to enhance the internal runs in support of experimental design 
[31,32]. Two sets of MDs with the overall heavy metal con-
centrations of 60 and 120 mg/L were performed, respectively. 
Each set included overall nine experimental runs as well as 
details of metals solution composition.
2.3. Adsorption modeling
The prediction of biosorption capability and investi-
gation of adsorption behavior was further strengthened by 
Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. These isotherms helped in estimating the quantity of metal sorbate that a particular adsorbent maintained as well as remained in experimen-tal solution at equilibrium [40,41]. According to Langmuir model, there is monolayer uptake of adsorbed molecules on uniform (homogeneous) layer and this adsorption takes place without any contact among adsorbed molecules. The Langmuir isotherm is represented by Eq. (3):

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Minimum run resolution IV screening design
The MRRIVSD was applied for the analysis of the con-
tribution of five factors. The observed or experimental 
responses of Cu(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II) for tested factors are summarized in Table 2 and statistical analysis is shown 
in Table 3. The predicted R
2 value and adjusted R2 value 
of factorial experiments for Cu, Zn, and Ni were in close 
association. The R2 value was larger for Cu (0.8983) as com-
pared to Ni (0.8947) and Zn (0.8939). The priority order, in accordance with R
2 values, was (Cu(II) > Zn(II) > Ni(II)). 
The larger F -values for all metals and lowest P -values show 
the significance for the models. The regression equations obtained by application of MRRIVSD were as follows:
Removal (%) of Cu = +59.62 + 12.36A + 5.69B – 6.49C +  
10.02D + 10.69E (5)
Removal (%) of Ni = +48.46 + 11.36A + 3.56B – 5.80C +  
7.96D + 13.17E (6)
Removal (%) of Zn = +40.5 + 10.97A + 6.55B – 2.77C +  
8.97D + 9.55E (7)
These regression models or equations represented the 
effect of experimental factors on responses. The terms A , B, 
C, D, and E  symbolize adsorption time, revolution speed, 
metal concentration, biosorbent quantity, and pH value. While, it is evident from the above proposed regression equations [Eqs. (5)–(7)] time, biosorbent dose, and pH have 
a considerable effect on the metal removal.
The effects of tested parameters or factors were addi-
tionally examined through main effects graphs for uptake 
of Cu(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II) as given in Figs. 1 and 2. These plots specify the virtual significance of effects of five tested 
factors. For every investigated metal, five graphs were 
drawn which demonstrated the effect of factors on the 
removal of metal ions. Overall, the effect of pH, biomass 
load, and time were main factors for the three studied metal ion removals. This result is formerly identified from Eqs. (5) to 
(7) for Cu(II) and Ni(II). The time, pH, and biomass dose 
had positive influence while initial Cu ion concentration 
and agitation speed was found unhelpful. On the other 
hand, in case of Zn(II), pH, shaking speed, biomass amount, and time influenced positively and metal ion concentration 
affected oppositely. Although, shaking speed and metal ion 
concentration were as well-involved in metal removals but 
their effects were less prominent than the remaining three 
factors as summarized in ANOVA (Table 3). So, there were three out of five factors that enhanced metal removal phe-
nomenon [14,46,47].
3.2. Data analysis from RSM
Based on the results from factorial deign, the perfor -
mance of ternary metal biosorption was investigated in 
subsequent RSM along with MDs. The optimized conditions from FD were pH 5.5, biomass dose 3 g/L, agitation veloc-ity 150 rpm, and contact time 12 h was utilized for further investigation (Table 4). The statistical importance of RSM was assessed by ANOVA. The results displayed larger F-values (1,604.34 for Cu, 101.5 for Zn, and 70.31 for Ni) and low probability value. This suggested that three regression models had high significance.
The value of R
2 (0.9993) was additional for Cu(II) but, for 
Zn(II) as well as Ni(II) was 0.985 and 0.984. For these met-als the numerical value of predicted R
2 also adjusted R2 was 
in close association. All these parameters have shown that models for regression study were significant statistically.
The prediction of multi metal adsorption was further 
strengthened by response surface contour plots. These plots for characteristic biosorption of Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) are

depicted in Fig. 3. Each contour plot showed many mix-
tures or combinations of two experimented variables while 
keeping third variable at central levels.
Fig. 3a illustrates that the adsorption of Cu was 
decreased with an increase in the concentration of Ni and 
Zn but after some time, Zn concentration did not influence the Cu adsorption, only Ni was involved in lessening the 
sorption of Cu(II). While Fig. 3b displays the combined 
effect of Cu and Zn concentration on the biosorption of Ni. 
The uptake of Ni was decreased with a rise in the initial concentration of Zn and Cu. So, both metals had a sup-
pressing effect on Ni uptake. Similarly, Fig. 3c explains the 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200152025303540455055Adsorption (%)

synchronized effect of Cu along with Ni, respectively. When 
the concentration of Cu was raised from 0 to 60 mg/L, the Zn uptake was decreased sharply, but the concentration of Ni influenced the Zn adsorption for a while after this Ni(II) 
did not influenced the Zn metal uptake. The suppression 
effect of Cu ion was greater than Ni ion on Zn uptake.
In all cases, every metal ion put suppressing effect on 
the binding of other metal ions, but Cu metal displayed 
maximum inhibitory action. However, Cu ions present in 
solution decreased the uptake capacity of Zn and Ni ions 
significantly. Briefly, the order of adsorption in TMS was 
establish to be Cu(II) > Zn(II) > Ni(II). The conclusions can be enlightened by the physical and chemical parameters of 
respective metals. Further investigation would be requi-
site to give details of the adsorption process since usually 
metal ions be supposed to fight for characteristic binding 
places lying on the biosorbent resulting in the reduction of the biosorption trend. Recognition of the mutual effect of heavy metals on their adsorption might considerably contribute to extensive biosorption function in wastewater management [22,23,48–51].
3.3. Mixture design
The experimental outcomes of the uptake capacity of 
three metals are also given in Table 5. The mixture exper -
iments were performed with similar conditions like RSM. 
The results were also validated by ANOVA. The ANOVA demonstrated that the bigger F -values (2,975.4 for Cu, 
1,331.4 for Zn, and 932.45 in support of Ni ion. The mini-mum values of P  recommended more exceptional model. 
The degree of deviation was estimated by computing R
2 
value. The R2 was greater for Cu (0.9967) and lesser for 
Zn (0.991) and Ni ions (0.9987), respectively. The values of co- relation coefficient R
2 and adjusted R2 were near to 
1 for three investigated metals, which indicates a close Table 4

association between experimental and predicted values. 
The Adjusted R2 numerical values were 0.9926 in favor 
of Cu(II), 0.9890 in support of Ni(II) as well as 0.9802 for Zn(II). While the predicted R
2 values were 0.9601 for Cu 
metal, 0.8371 for Ni ion, and 0.9368 for Zn. Noticeably, 
both R2 values (predicted and adjusted) were close to each 
other. Figs. 4–6 are graphical depictions for adsorption of 
Cu, Ni, and Zn in ternary metal solution, respectively. Two graphical methodologies were applied to explain the data in two MD, that is, contour plot and 3D triangular plots. In the TCDs (Figs. 4a–6a), evaluation of the metal bio-sorption profile demonstrates that the level of influence for sorption of an objective metal through A. alexandrae was in the array of Cu

Cu, and Zn ions adsorption, respectively. Consequently, 
biosorption inclination of A. alexandrae emerged to lessen in the array of Cu
2+ > Zn2+ > Ni2+. Whereas, in the triangu-
lar 3D adsorption surfaces (Figs. 4b–6b), the separation among the 3D diagrams created by Simplex-lattice model along with the actual experimental records (in solid dots) are noticeably exposed. The expected surfaces effectively harmonized the corresponding experimental data, signify-ing that the SLD could explain the actions of multi-metal biosorption fairly well. In order to improve the feasibility for practical purposes, multi-metal biosorption experimen-tation was performed at a higher total concentration of 120 mg/L with a mixture experimental design. The conse-quences for Cu
2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ biosorption are revealed in 
Figs. 7–9, respectively. The tendency of viable biosorption (Cu
2+ > Zn2+ > Ni2+) was analogous to that examined in the 
MD experiments with an overall metal concentration of 60 mg/L. Hence, the expected surface from SLD simulation well-coordinated with the experimental data. Comparing Figs. 4–6 with 7–9, the contour of the triangular 3D surface was relatively the same for the runs with two unlike overall metal concentrations (60 and of 120 mg/L). All these findings 
recommend that the interaction of the objective metal ion with its contemporary metal ions throughout biosorption was like in spite of entire metal concentration. Conversely, with rise in metal concentrations in experimental runs, the amount of adsorption capacities (mg/g) were increased in that respective runs. This proposes that the overall metal concentration of 60 mg/L had not entirely saturated the binding sites on A. alexandrae. In this activity, in relation to the outcomes of RSM along with two MDs, highest metal uptake powers of King palm were set up as 45.5 mg/g for Cu
2+, 30 mg/g for Zn2+, and 25 mg/g for Ni2+, respectively. Kaduková and Horváthová [52] investigated that biosorp-tion profile of intended metals, that is, Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) reduced in the order: Cu > Zn > Ni.
3.4. Equilibrium study of biosorption
The biosorption isotherm experiments were performed 
at the concentration vary 10–60 mg/L for 8 h, while keep-
ing other investigational constraints or factors identi-
cal to RSM and MDs. The data is shown in Table 5. The 
adsorption data was better fitted with Langmuir iso-therm due to the high value of co-relation coefficient and Langmuir constant [40]. In case of SMS, the order of priority 
was; Zn > Cu > Ni, owing to high value of R
2. In reference 
to the high values of the Kc and R2, the reliable conclusions 
concerning the order of adsorption was achieved to exist 
Cu(II) > Zu(II) > Ni(II) in ternary systems [53–59]. On the other hand, in Freundlich isotherm the numerical values R
2 and Kf were smaller. The smaller values of 1/n , R2, and 
Kf have shown that the adsorption trend of three metals 
onto King Palm was not good at premeditated conditions. This designates that Cu(II) ions were simply sorbed from aqueous metal solution on top of the biomass with elevated adsorption capacity [60–66]. The priority of biosorbent for many types of heavy metal adsorbate perhaps inter -
related to the solution chemistry, specific features of the binding sites [43–45,54,67–73] and salient physicochemical features of the adsorbate. Briefly, there are feasible inter -
action effects among unlike species in solution in addition to potential interactions going on the surface of biomass maintained by the biosorption mechanism [53,60,64,76–77].

The findings revealed that adsorption efficiency of 
A. alexandrae was promising for Cu, Ni, and Zn ions from 
the mixture, that is, single metal, bi-metal (BMSs), and 
tri-metal systems (TMSs), hence, it could be employed for the sequestration of metals ion from industrial efflu-
ents because effluents have diverse types of pollutants [18,46,78–84] including metal ions.
4. Conclusions
Following conclusions have been drawn, findings con-
firmed that the application of innovative experimental 
design methodologies presented an efficient way to pre-
dict the performance of practicable biosorption processes in single, BMSs and TMSs using A. alexandrae as adsorbent. 
The experimental model was used at notably less numbers 
of experimental runs, providing the possibility to observe 
the special effects of important affecting factors on the sys-
tem. A series of factorial experiments has been optimized for evaluation of main effects as well as interactions among the factors. The time, pH, and biomass dose had positive 
influence while initial Cu ion concentration and agitation 
speed was found unhelpful. On the other hand, in case of Zn(II), pH, shaking speed, biomass amount, and time 
influenced positively and metal ion concentration affected 
oppositely. The uptake of Ni was decreased with rise in initial concentration of Zn and Cu. So, both metals had 
suppressing effect on Ni uptake. The order of adsorption 
in TMS was established as Cu(II) > Zn(II) > Ni(II). The out-
comes of RSM along with two MDs, highest metal uptake 
of adsorbent was 45.5 mg/g for Cu
2+, 30 mg/g for Zn2+, and 
25 mg/g for Ni2+. The adsorption data was better fitted 
with Langmuir isotherm due to high value of co-relation 
coefficient. It is concluded that it is the specific features 
of binding site and solution chemistry that describes the priority for adsorbents.
