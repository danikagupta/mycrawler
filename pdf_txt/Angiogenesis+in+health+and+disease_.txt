Vessel growth: modes and impact on health
Small blood vessels consist only of endothelial cells (ECs), whereas larger
vessels are surrounded by mural cells (pericytes in medium-sized and
smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in large vessels). Vessels can grow in severalways. Vasculogenesis refers to the formation of blood vessels by endothe-lial progenitors, angiogenesis and arteriogenesis refer to the sproutingand subsequent stabilization of these sprouts by mural cells, and collat-eral growth denotes the expansive growth of pre-existing vessels, formingcollateral bridges between arterial networks. Both capillary angiogenesis
and arterial growth are targets for therapy, as distal capillaries distributethe flow while proximal arterioles provide bulk flow to the tissue. Whenvessel growth is dysregulated, it has a major impact on our health and
contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders, some quite unex-
pected. Indeed, a long list of disorders is characterized or caused by exces-sive angiogenesis. Historically, the best known are cancer, psoriasis,arthritis and blindness, but many additional common disorders such asobesity, asthma, atherosclerosis and infectious disease are included, andthe list is still growing ( Table 1). Several congenital or inherited diseases
are also caused by abnormal vascular remodeling ( Table 1). In addition,
insufficient vessel growth and abnormal vessel regression not only causeheart and brain ischemia, but can also lead to neurodegeneration, hyper-tension, pre-eclampsia, respiratory distress, osteoporosis and other disor-
ders ( Table 2). Few other processes have as daunting an impact as
angiogenesis on the well-being of so many people worldwide. Recentadvances in the understanding of molecular, genetic and cellular mecha-nisms of vessel growth and their possible implications for medicine willbe discussed in this overview.
Endothelial progenitors
For many years, the prevailing dogma stated that vessels in the embryo
developed from endothelial progenitors, whereas sprouting of vessels inthe adult resulted only from division of differentiated ECs. Recent evi-dence, however, indicates that endothelial progenitors contribute to ves-sel growth both in the embryo and in ischemic, malignant or inflamedtissues in the adult, and can even be th erapeutically used to stimulate ves-sel growth in ischemic tissues, a process termed ‘therapeutic vasculogen-
esis’
1–3(Fig. 1). ECs differentiate from angioblasts in the embryo4and
from endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), mesoangioblasts, multipotentadult progenitor cells, or side-p opulation cells in the adult bone mar-
row
1,5.EPCs can also contribute to vessel growth by releasing angiogenic
grow th factors6.ECs may also share a common origin with blood cells in
the embryo and arise from the hemangioblast4.Endothelial and
hematopoietic progenitors and their descendents share common mark-ers, are affected by common signals, and influence each other. Forinstance, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) bud from hemogenic ECs inthe embryo, and HSCs and leukocytes stimulate angiogenesis partly byreleasing angiogenic factors or transdifferentiating to ECs
7–10.
Identification of the signals that recruit or differentiate these progenitors
offers opportunities to manipulate their contributions to vasculargrowth. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth
factor (PlGF, a homolog of VEGF), angiopoietin (Ang)-1, inhibitor ofdifferentiation (Id) proteins, cytokines, and other signals have a role
9–12.
Overall, the functional contribution of EPCs and HSCs to pathologicalangiogenesis still remains largely undefined (see accompanying review inthis issue
13).
Vascular cell specification
Endothelial progenitors differentiate to mature ECs, but not all ECs arealike. One well-known anatomical and physiological distinction betweenvessels is that of arteries and veins. Not only do they differ in the blood
pressure they sustain and the thickness of their SMC coat, but their ECsand SMCs also have a distinct identity and origin. For instance, SMCssurrounding some thoracic vessels are derived from neural crest, whereascoronary SMCs are derived from epicardium, and other SMCs arise from
mesenchyme
14.Little is known about the various pathways specifying the
identity of arterial and venous SMCs, but recent genetic studies offerinsight into the signals controlling arterial and venous identities of ECs.The Notch pathway, with its ligands (Delta-like-4, Jagged-1 and Jagged-2) and receptors (Notch-1, Notch-3 and Notch-4), promotes arterial fateof ECs by repressing venous differentiation
15,16.Sonic Hedgehog and
VEGF act upstream, whereas Gridlock probably acts downstream ofNotch to determine arterial fate, even before the onset of flow
16,17.ECs
can differentiate into either arterial or venous ECs in embryonic develop-ment, in the neonatal retina and even in the adult heart, indicating thatECs have a remarkable phenotypic plasticity
18,19.S e l e c t i v e  u s e of arterial
or venous ECs or their precursors may offer opportunities for therapeu-Angiogenesis in health and disease

Blood vessels constitute the first organ in the embryo and form the largest network in our body but, sadly, are also
often deadly. When dysregulated, the formation of new blood vessels contributes to numerous malignant, ischemic,inflammatory, infectious and immune disorders. Molecular insights into these processes are being generated at arapidly increasing pace, offering new therapeutic opportunities that are currently being evaluated.

tic vasculogenesis. Notch signaling, however, is also critical for proper
maintenance of arteries. Mutations of the SMC-specific Notch-3 recep-tor,which disrupt SMC anchorage to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and
impair SMC survival, cause degeneration of cerebral arterioles, leading tocerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
leukoencephalopathy
20.Besides Notch, bone-marrow tyrosine kinase
and neuropilin-1 (a VEGF164-specific receptor) also influence arterial
specification18.By secreting VEGF, peripheral nerves codetermine arte-
rial differentiation, providing a molecular explanation as to why arteries
and nerves often run alongside each other in the body21.
Blood vessels in various tissues have specialized functions, and ECs are
therefore equipped with distinct properties—there might be even asmany different EC types as there are organs in the body (see accompany-ing review in this issue
22). What determines this EC heterogeneity and
organ-specific angiogenesis? First, the expression and activity of generalangiogenic factors such as VEGF or Ang-1 varies greatly in different tis-sues. Low-permeability tumors overexpress Ang-1 or underexpressVEGF (or both), whereas high-permeability tumors lack Ang-1 (ref. 23).Another example is the effect of Ang-1, which stimulates angiogenesis in
the skin but suppresses vascular growth in the heart
19,24.S e c o nd, organ-
specific angiogenic factors determine the angiogenic switch, but in arestricted manner in particular organs (for example, blood vessel/epicar-
dial substance and fibulin-2 in the heart, and endocrine gland VEGF andprokineticin-2 in endocrine glands
25). Such organ-specific molecules
hold great promise for use in developing safer angiogenic therapies.Tumor vessels also change their phenotype and express new addresses
(‘vascular zip codes’), which are absent or barely detectable in quiescentvessels
26.Some vessels are not even lined by ECs: cytotrophoblasts line
the maternal spiral arteries during normal placentation (a processtermed ‘pseudovasculogenesis’), SMCs line the neointima when re-
endothelialization after vessel injury is incomplete, and malignant cellsline some tumor vessels (a process called ‘vascular mimicry’
27).
Vascular boundaries and polarity
After endothelial progenitors differentiate into ECs and form a primitive
vascular labyrinth, further remodeling of such primitive vessels into amore complex network requires the demarcation of arterial and venousboundaries, as well as the establishment of vascular polarity ( Fig. 1). The
Eph-Ephrin system is involved in the organiza-
tion of such vascular boundaries. EphrinB2marks arterial ECs and SMCs, whereas EphB4,a receptor for EphrinB2, marks only veins.EphrinB2-EphB4 signaling is critical for the
establishment of arterial and venous identities,and participates in the formation of arterio-venous anastamoses by arresting EC migration
at the arterial-venous interface
28–30.Capillaries
were long considered to lack any identity, but
EphrinB2 expression extends into capillaries
midway between terminal arterioles and post-capillary venules, indicating that they are eitherarterial or venous. As development proceeds,EphrinB2 expression extends also to SMCs in
arteries. In pathological angiogenesis, ECs ofsome new vessels also express EphrinB2, con-trary to the dogma that tumor vessels arise
exclusively from postcapillary venules
31,32.
Very little is known about vascular polarity,
yet many vessels, such as the large thoracic ves-
sels, develop in an asymmetric pattern and areonly present in the left or right side of the body.The embryonic pharyngeal arch arteries (PAA) initially develop symmet-
rically, but are subsequently remode led asymmetrically into various large
thoracic arteries. Because of its complexity, this process is often derailed,giving rise to congenital vascular malformations. Hotspots of VEGF
expression around the PAAs are essential for their asymmetric remodel-
ing. When VEGF expression is dysregulated, the left-side fourth PAAabnormally regresses, whereas the right-side fourth PAA, predeterminedto regress otherwise, persists as a right-side aorta, giving rise to the typical
vascular malformations and birth defects found in DiGeorge syn-drome
33.A combinatorial role of Ang-1 and the Tie-1 receptor seems to
be essential in establishing the right-side venous system34.T h e r e  are
many vascular malformations, especially in neural tissue, that may result
from ‘misguiding’ and aberrant patterning, but their etiology remainslargely enigmatic. Another intriguing question is whether homeoboxgenes determine vascular identity, boundaries, polarity and patterning.
Angiogenesis and arteriogenesis
The nascent vascular bed expands by sprouting and matures into a sys-tem of stable vessels ( Fig. 1 ). Hypoxia is an important stimulus for expan-
sion of the vascular bed. Initially, cells are oxygenated by simple diffusionof oxygen, but when tissues grow beyond the limit of oxygen diffusion,hypoxia triggers vessel growth by signaling through hypoxia-inducible
transcription factors (HIFs; see accompanying review in this issue
35).
HIFs upregulate many angiogenic genes, but the induction of VEGF isperhaps the most remarkable—up to 30-fold within minutes. VEGFstimulates physiological and pathological angiogenesis in a strict dose-dependent manner and is therefore currently being evaluated for pro-and antiangiogenic therapy (see accompanying review in this issue
36).
Loss of a single allele causes embryonic vascular defects37,38,and reduc-
tion of VEGF levels by only 25% impairs spinal cord perfusion andresults in motor neuron degeneration, reminiscent of amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis
39.PlGF, which binds Flt-1, enhances angiogenesis but only
under pathological conditions. It amplifies VEGF-driven angiogenesis inpart through a unique cross-talk between Flt-1 and Flk-1 (refs. 12,40).The role of VEGFB in angiogenesis remains to be determined. BesidesVEGF family members, numerous other molecules have been docu-mented to regulate EC growth, including growth factors, chemokines,cytokines, lipid mediators, hormones and neuropeptides (see below).

ECs are elongated, thin and fragile cells, yet they build channels that do
not collapse and that efficiently distribute blood to the various parts ofthe body. They also have long half-lives of several years, but when trig-gered are capable of rapidly sending out sprouts in a coordinated anddirectional manner. How can they possess all these qualities? It is partlybecause cells within the vessel wall communicate with each other andwith cells inside and outside the vessel lumen. They sense changes in
blood flow and pressure, and dynamically interact with the internalcytoskeleton and surrounding ECM, all in an integrated manner.Vascular cells are equipped with a set of molecules that allow them to per-
form these functions (see below). In quiescent vessels, vascular endothe-lial cadherin in adherens junctio ns and claudins, as well as occludin and
JAM-1 in tight junctions, provide mechanical strength and tightness and
establish a permeability barrier. These molecules do not only serve as‘mechanical zippers’ , but also transmit crucial signals for endothelial sur-
vival and other functions
41.When ECs migrate during vessel sprouting,
these contacts are transiently dissolved but later re-established, once ECsassemble a new sprout. Interrupting this cycle disrupts vessel assembly intumors
42.VEGF loosens, whereas Ang-1 tightens these contacts; the ther-
apeutic potential of the latter is currently being evaluated in conditions ofsepsis, inflammation, injury, stroke and cancer
43.Homotypic ECs con-
tacts through CD31 (PECAM) and intercellular communicationthrough connexins (Cx) in gap junctions are also crucial for vessel for-mation and maintenance, as the loss of both Cx37 and Cx40 causes cav-ernous hemangiomas, and deficiency in Cx43 dysregulates coronaryartery formation
44.
The ECM provides necessary contacts between ECs and the surround-
ing tissue, and thus prevents vessels from collapsing. In quiescent vessels,a basement membrane of collagen IV , laminin and other components
encases vascular cells; pericytes and ECs are even embedded in the samebasement membrane. An interstitial matrix of collagen I and elastinbetween vascular cells further provides visco-elasticity and strength tothe vessel wall. The ECM also regulates the formation of new vesselsprouts. When vascular cells migrate to form new sprouts, this matrixnetwork is not only proteolytically broken down, but its composition is
also altered. Proteinases expose new cryptic epitopes in ECM proteins(such as in collagen IV) or change their structure (fibrillar versusmonomer collagen), which induce EC and SMC migration
45.I n  a ddi-
tion, a provisional matrix of fibronectin, fibrin and other componentsprovides a support scaffold, guiding ECs to their targets. Integrins arecell-surface receptors of spe cific ECM molecules that, by bidirectionally
transmitting information between the outside and inside of vascular
cells, assist vascular cells to build new vessels in coordination with their
surroundings
46,47.The αvβ3and αvβ5integrins have long been consid-
ered to positively regulate the angiogenic switch, because their pharma-cological antagonists suppress pathological angiogenesis. Genetic
deletion studies suggest, however, that vascular integrins inhibit angio-genesis by suppressing VEGF- and Flk-1-mediated EC survival, by trans-
dominantly blocking other integrins or by mediating the antiangiogenicactivity of thrombospondins (TSPs) and other angiogenesis inhibitors(such as tumstatin, endostatin, angiostatin and PEX). It remains to bedetermined whether and under what conditions integrins have positiveor negative roles in angiogenesis.
Remodeling of the ECM during vessel sprouting requires breakdown
by proteinases, including plasminogen activators (such as urokinase
plaminogen activator (uPA) and its inhibitor, PAI-1), matrix metallopro-

teinases (MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)),
heparinases, chymases, tryptases and cathepsins48–50.Proteinases also
facilitate EC sprouting by liberating matrix-bound angiogenic activators(basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), VEGF and transforming growthfactor (TGF)- β) and proteolytically activating angiogenic chemokines
(such as IL-1 β). Their activity is, however, not always related to proteoly-
sis, as shown for uPA receptor and TIMP-3 (refs. 51,52). When consider-ing the critical role of the ECM in vessel growth and maintenance, it isconceivable that proteolytic remodeling of the ECM must occur in a bal-
anced manner. Insufficient breakdown prevents vascular cells from leav-ing their original position, but excessive breakdown removes criticalsupport and guidance cues for migrating ECs and, in fact, inhibits angio-genesis
50,53.Proteinases can also have a role in the resolution of angio-
genesis, as they liberate matrix-bound inhibitors (TSP-1, canstatin,tumstatin, endostatin and platelet factor (PF)-4) and inactivate angio-genic cytokines (such as stromal cell–derived factor-1). These pleiotropicactivities may explain why proteinases and their receptors and inhibitorsoften have activities that are context- and concentration-dependent. Itmay also explain why an inhibitor such as PAI-1 is a predictor of poor,not good, clinical outcome for many cancers
50,53.
Establishment of a functional vascular network further requires that
nascent vessels mature into durable vessels ( Fig. 2). The association of
pericytes and SMCs with newly formed vessels regulates EC prolifera-tion, survival, migration, differentiation, vascular branching, blood flowand vascular permeability (see accompanying review in this issue
54).
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and its receptor, PDGFR- β,
have essential roles in the stabilization of nascent blood vessels by recruit-ing PDGFR- β-positive mesenchymal progenitors. Dropout or insuffi-
cient recruitment of mural cells results in EC growth, permeability,fragility, vessel enlargement, bleeding, impaired perfusion and hypoxia inembryos lacking PDGF-B
55,in retinas of diabetics, in tumors56and in
hemangiomas, which are the nonmalignant vascular tumors that rapidlyenlarge in infants and often spontaneously regress
57.The subsequent
increase in VEGF further aggravates vascular permeability and edema,and promotes hemangioma formation. In contrast, a combination ofPDGF-BB and VEGF results in the formation of more mature vesselsthan monotherapy with either factor, a finding relevant for future devel-opment of therapeutic angiogenesis strategies
58.PDGF-CC and
PDGF–DD also promote angiogenesis, but their roles remain less wellcharacterized
59.
Another signaling system involved in vessel maintenance, growth and
stabilization is the Tie-2 receptor, which binds the angiopoietins (Ang-1and Ang-2). Unlike Ang-2, which activates Tie-2 on some cells but blocksTie-2 on others, Ang-1 consistently activates Tie-2. Even though trapping
angiopoietins suppresses pathological vascularization
60,their role is
pleiotropic and context-dependent. Ang-1 stimulates vessel growth inskin, ischemic limbs, gastric ulcers and in some tumors
23,61,presumably
because it is an EC survival factor and mobilizes EPCs and HSCs62.B u t
Ang-1 also suppresses angiogenesis in tumors and the heart19,63.
Although it is still not entirely understood, the antiangiogenic effect ofAng-1 may relate to the fact that vessels must loosen up before ECs can
migrate; if vessels are too tight, vessel sprouting may be impeded. Ang-1tightens vessels by affecting junctional molecules
43and by promoting the
interaction between ECs and mural cells as an adhesive protein andrecruiting pericytes
64.Ang-2 has been proposed to stimulate the growth
of immature (SMC-poor) tumor vessels by loosening endothelial-periendothelial cell interactions and degrading the extracellular matrix,thereby antagonizing Ang-1 (refs. 63,65). The angiogenic activity of Ang-2 seems to be contextual as well, however. Ang-2 synergizes with VEGF tostimulate angiogenesis in the heart

signals are present, Ang-2 causes EC death and
vessel regression66,67.A precise balance of Tie-2
signals thus seems critical, as an activating Tie-2mutation causes venous malformations that are
composed of dilated, serpiginous endothelial
channels covered by a variable amount of
SMCs
68.
Additional signaling molecules, such as
members of the TGF- βsuperfamily, contribute
to the resolution and maturation phases of
angiogenesis, but in a pleiotropic manner. TGF-βfamily ligands stimulate type II receptors that,
in turn, phosphorylate type I receptors (such asactivin receptor–like kinase (ALK)) and acti-vate the downstream signaling Smads
69.
Endoglin is a type III receptor, which facilitatesbinding of TGF- β1 to the type II receptors.
Both pro- and antiangiogenic properties havebeen ascribed to TGF- β1, through effects on
ECs and other cell types. At low doses, TGF- β1
contributes to the angiogenic switch by upregu-
lating angiogenic factors and proteinases,whereas at high doses, TGF- β1 inhibits EC
growth, promotes basement membrane refor-
mation and stimulates SMC differentiation andrecruitment. Hereditary hemorrhagic telang-
iectasia (HHT), characterized by telangiectasiasand arterio-venous malformations, has beenassociated with loss-of-function mutations ofendoglin (HHT-1) and ALK-1 (HHT-2)
69.
Because interpretations of the respective rolesof ALK-1 (with Smad1 and Smad5) and ALK5(with Smad2 and Smad3) in the activation orresolution phases of angiogenesis differ, the
precise mechanisms of the vascular abnormali-ties of HHT lesions remain uncertain
69–71.
Nevertheless, an imbalance between vessel
growth and maturation seems to cause the
excessive fusion of capillary plexi into cav-
ernous vessels and the hyperdilation of largevessels
72.Mutations in the type II bone mor-
phogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)-2 gene,also belonging to the TGF- βsuperfamily, cause
primary pulmonary hypertension, in whichpulmonary arterioles become occluded byintravascular endothelial tumors
73.By downregulating BMPR-1A
(mediating BMPR-2 signaling), increased Ang-1 levels may further con-tribute to primary pulmonary hypertension by recruiting SMCs around
pulmonary vessels
74.In other primary pulmonary hypertension subjects,
ECs acquire somatic mutations that lead to ‘misguided angiogenesis’75,76.
Collateral growth
Unlike distal capillaries, which distribute blood flow to individual cells,
arteries provide bulk flow to the tissue and are therefore of utmostimportance. When an artery is occluded, its vascular territory becomesischemic. Because arterial systems are often interconnected by pre-exist-ing collateral vessels, however, the collaterals can enlarge and salvage theischemic region
77.The mechanisms of angiogenesis and collateral
growth differ significantly. Because of the large pressure differences
between the perfusion territories, the increased shear stress activates ECs,which then recruit monocytes. These cells produce growth factors andproteinases (uPA and MMPs), which enable SMCs to migrate and divide,
explaining why depletion of monocytes impairs, whereas delivery of
monocytes enhances, collateral growth
78,79.Cytokines that attract mono-
cytes or prolong their life span (such as monocyte chemoattractant pro-tein (MCP)-1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor,
TGF-β1 and tumor necrosis factor- α) enhance collateral growth,
whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10) are inhibitory
80–83.
PlGF also enhances collateral growth, not only because it recruits mono-cytes, but also because it stimulates EC and SMC growth
12,84.D e l i v e r y  o f
acidic FGF, FGF-4 or basic FGF (together with PDGF-BB) stimulates col-lateral growth, in part by upregulating PDGFR expression
85.VEGF alone
seems to affect capillary angioge nesis more efficiently than collateral
growth, explaining, at least in part, why results of clinical trials have not
been more positive77,86.Coadministration of VEGF with additional mol-
ecules such as PDGF, PlGF or Ang-1 may enhance its therapeutic poten-tial (ref. 58 and P .C., unpublished data). The identification of molecules

regulating collateral growth offers significant potential for the treatment
of ischemic heart and limb disease.
Leukocytes and angiogenesis
Inflammation- and immune-driven angiogenesis affect numerous disor-
ders ( Tables 1 and 2), in part because most leukocyte subtypes produce a
myriad of angiogenic factors such as VEGF, PlGF, PDGF, basic FGF, Ang-
2, epidermal growth factor, TGF- β1, MCP-1 and various interleukins and
proteinases (tryptase, chymase, MMPs, heparanase and uPA; Fig. 1)87,88.
Leukocytes affect many angiogenic processes. For instance, neutrophils
and natural killer cells have been implicated in cyclical uterine angiogen-esis, and in abnormal angiogenesis in endometriosis
89,whereas tumor-
associated macrophages promote cancer by releasing angiogenic factorsand inducing tumor cells to release angiogenic factors
90.Mast cells, when
they encounter allergens and pathogens in the skin and mucosa, releasevasoactive and angiogenic factors, thereby affecting autoimmune dis-eases in many organs. Mast cells also infiltrate skin carcinomas, wherethey hyperactivate angiogenesis through chymase-dependent activationof MMP-9 (ref. 91). Type I dendritic cells help eradicate tumors throughimmune stimulation and suppression of tumor angiogenesis
92.
Monocytes are a source of EPCs6and can differentiate into endothelial-
like cells93.Because leukocytes also generate angiogenesis inhibitors, their
overall role in initiating or terminating angiogenesis depends on the tem-
poral and spatial balance of these modulators.
Leukocytes and vascular cells influence each other in other ways ( Fig.
1). Angiogenic factors amplify the inflammatory process by recruiting
leukocytes and affecting their function12.For instance, VEGF enhances,
whereas TSP-1 and Ang-1 forestall, T-ce ll-dependent allograft arteriopa-
thy by reducing leukocyte infiltration94.VEGF promotes cancer, not only
by stimulating angiogenesis, but also by inhibiting the functional matu-
ration of dendritic cells and enhancing adhesion of natural killer cells to
tumor microvessels95,96.Other angiogenic molecules (such as PlGF,
TGF-β1, PDGF and FGFs) also modulate leukocyte function12.Because
of the significant involvement of leukocytes, anti-inflammatory drugssuppress pathological angiogenesis
97.Another class of candidates are
chemokines, which recruit leukocytes and directly stimulate ECs. These
include growth-related oncogene, IL-8, stromal cell–derived factor-1,MCP-1 and others that bind CXCR2 and CXCR4 receptors
98.
Coagulation and angiogenesis
Fibrin-rich clot formation and platelet aggregation precede infiltra-tion of blood vessels into a wound. Not surprisingly, therefore, hemo-stasis and angiogenesis are closely linked
99–101(Fig. 1 ). Upon
activation, platelets release large stores of angiogenic factors such asVEGF, PDGF, TGF- β,IL-6, thrombin and sphingosine-1-phosphate.
The latter stimulates the growth and stability of nascent vessels bytightening their junctions and recruiting mural cells
102.Platelets also
contain antiangiogenic factors (TSP-1, PF-4 and others) that may have
a role in the resolution of angiogenesis once the wound has healed.The link between angiogenesis and hemostasis also has implicationsfor cancer. Thromboembolism is a common cause of death in cancerpatients. By covering tumor cells, platelets protect tumor emboli fromimmune surveillance and promote their lodging at distant metastaticsites. In many tumors, production of tissue factor, initiation of coagu-lation, and microvessel density are closely associated
101.Tissue factor
upregulates VEGF, downregulates TSP-1 and, by initiating coagula-tion, generates additional angiogenic pathways that are dependent onfactor Xa, thrombin, the protease-activated receptors (PAR-1, PAR-2,PAR-3 and PAR-4) and fibrin
100.The incidence of thrombosis in can-
cer patients treated with angiogenesis inhibitors may be attributable to
EC dysfunction and death, platelet activation, the release of tumorprocoagulants and cytokines upon tumor lysis, and an inflammatory
response99.
Vessel regression
Vessel regression, a physiological mechanism to match perfusion with
metabolic demand, occurs when the nascent vasculature consists of toomany vessels. Vessel regression also constitutes the basis of many antian-giogenic therapeutic strategies. Abnormal vessel regression also con-
tributes to the pathogenesis of numerous disorders, however. Several
mechanisms shift the angiogenic switch from ‘on’ to ‘off’ ( Fig. 2and Table
2). Removal of angiogenic stimuli causes vessels to regress, as in
tumors
103and the heart104,especially when vessels have only been
recently assembled and are still immature. When angiogenic stimuli are
provided for a sufficient length of t ime, new vessels mature and persist for
months, even after the angiogenic stimulus is withdrawn104.Flow may
have an important role in determining whether neovessels regress or per-sist. By affecting several factors (including MMPs, PDGF, basic FGF, inte-grins and nitric oxide), flow stimulates hyperplasia of ECs and SMCs,
and induces the reorganization of endothelial junctions and the deposi-tion of ECM—all of which contribute to vessel maturation. Thus, insuffi-cient perfusion may lead to re gression, whereas sufficient perfusion
promotes vessel persistence. An abnormal sensitivity of small arterioles tovasoconstrictor stimuli may lead to functional constriction and subse-quent structural rarefaction of nonperfused ‘ghost arterioles’ in hyper-tension
105.Pericytes also determine the susceptibility of vessels to
regression. Indeed, once vessels are surrounded by pericytes, they become
resistant to oxygen-induced regression103.Delivery of PlGF or VEGF
with PDGF-BB causes vessel maturation and results in the persistence of
stable, durable vessels for more than a year12,58.In contrast, disruption of
endothelial-pericyte associations results in the regression of vessels106.
Angiogenesis inhibitors also contribute to vessel regression. TSP-1
inhibits angiogenesis through direct effe cts on ECs and indirect effects on
growth factor mobilization or activation107.Upregulation of endogenous
TSP-1 and TSP-2 contributes to the resolution of angiogenesis and vessel
stabilization after ischemia, and forced overexpression of TSP-1 or TSP-2in cancer cells results in reduced tumor vascularization and tumorgrowth
107.There are more angiogenesis inhibitors, however. When VEGF
levels are low, Ang-2 marks regressing vessels108;i n t e r ferons exert angio-
static effects by lowering the expression of basic FGF and VEGF.Macrophages (such as hyalocytes in the eye) contribute to vessel regres-
sion by releasing TGF- β1 (ref. 109). Inhibitory PAS domain protein, a
splice variant of HIF-3 α,functions as a dominant-negative regulator of
hypoxia-induced angiogenesis to maintain an avascular phenotype in
certain tissues
110.Additional inhibitors include chemokines binding
CXCR3 (such as PF-4, Mig, interferon-inducible protein-10 and oth-ers)
98,soluble receptors (Flt-1 and Tie-2), clotting antagonists and oth-
ers. A growing list of inhibitors is being discovered, including cleavageproducts of matrix components (such as arresten, canstatin and tum-statin from collagen IV; vastatin from collagen VIII; restin from collagen
XV;and endostatin from collagen XVIII), proteinases or enzymes (such
as PEX from MMP2; mini-TrpRS from tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase)or plasma proteins (such as angiostatin from plasminogen; 16K prolactinfrom prolactin; and fragments of several serpins)
111.The endogenous
roles of many of these cleavage products in physiological and pathologi-
cal angiogenesis remain enigmatic. Nevertheless, they offer opportunitiesto suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth when administered.
Conclusion
Historically, angiogenesis was initially only implicated in cancer, arthritis
and psoriasis. In recent years it has, however, become increasingly evidentthat excessive, insufficient or abnormal angiogenesis contributes to the

pathogenesis of many more disorders. Ongoing clinical trials reveal that
both pro- and antiangiogenic treatments with single angiogenic mole-cules is more challenging than anticipated, and monotherapy with a sin-gle angiogenesis inhibitor may not suffice to combat the myriad of
angiogenic factors produced by cancer cells. This may not be surprising,however, when one considers that building new, functional and durablevessels requires a complex interplay of multiple molecular signals. The
challenge for the coming years is thus to define the molecular basis and
pathways of angiogenic disorders in greater detail and in a more inte-grated manner, so that the excitement of the science can be converted
into the development of efficient, safe therapies.
