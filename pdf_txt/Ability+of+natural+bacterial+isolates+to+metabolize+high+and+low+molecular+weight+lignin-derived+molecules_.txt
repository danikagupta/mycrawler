Bacterial degradation of lignin has been 
recently reviewed by one of us (1). Evidence 
reported in that work showed that bacteria 
are much less efficient than fungi in degrad­
ing lignin. To date it is not clear whether 
non-filamentous bacteria secrete ligninoly tic 
enzymes outside of the cell. The low degree 
of lignin mineralization observed with these 
microorganisms (2-4) could be explained 
by intracellular metabolism of small 
molecular weight lignin fragments that 
are released abiotically from the polymer 
(5). This capacity to degrade and even grow 
on lignin substructures strongly suggests 
that bacteria play an important role in 
the turnover of lignin in the biosphere. 
Actinomycetes also exhibit a poor lignin 
mineralization capacity (6, 7). However, 
filamentous bacteria attack grass lignocellu-
lose producing lignin-rich soluble fragments 
called APPL (for acid precipitable polymeric 
lignin, MW > 5,000). Slow progress is being 
made in the understanding of the mechanism 
involved in this process (see below). 
In this article we discuss metabolic path­
ways for the degradation of lignin dimers 
in various bacterial strains and the enzymes 
catalyzing cleavage of intermonomeric 
linkages. Attention is also given to bacterial 
action of polymeric lignin. 
Metabolism of dimeric structures 
There are several reports dealing with 
bacterial degradation of dimeric lignin-
model compounds. These include aerobic 
strains from genera as diverse as Pseudo-
monas, Corynebacterium, Streptomyces, 
Arthrobacter and Agrobacterium, as well 
as anaerobic bacteria (1). In most instances, partial catabolic pathways have been 
elucidated. 
Catabolism of arylglycerol-0-aryl ether 
(/3-0-4) compounds 
These dimers are frequently used as lignin 
models because they contain the inter­
monomeric linkage most frequently found 
in lignin (8). Ether cleavage has been 
observed in in vivo studies with four dif­
ferent Pseudomonas strains: P. paucimobilis 
TMY 1009 (9), P. acidovorans D3 (10), 
P. fluoresceins biovar I (11) and P. pauci­
mobilis SYK-6 (12). With guaiacylglycerol-
j3-guaiacyl ether as growing substrate, 
guaiacol and /3-hydroxypropiovanillone are 
detected in the cultures, the latter being 
the only C6-C3 compound identified (Fig. 
1A). In turn, the non-phenolic counterpart 
of this dimer gives rise to 0-hydroxypro-
pioveratrone as metabolic intermediate. 
On the other hand, dimers lacking the Cy 
hydroxymethyl group produce the C6-C2 
intermediates acetovanillone or acetovera-
trone. All this evidence points to a reductive 
type of cleavage, although the possibility 
that the reduced intermediates are not 
formed directly after ether cleavage can not 
be discarded. 
In spite of intensive efforts made by 
several groups to isolate the enzyme 
responsible for this reaction, preliminary 
evidence of such activity was reported 
only in 1989 (12). Crude extracts prepared 
from the membrane fraction of P. paucimo­
bilis SYK-6 cleave guaiacylglycerol-0-guaia-
cyl ether to yield j3-hydroxypropiovanillone 
and guaiacol. The activity is enhanced by 
NADH and is unstable in the absence of 
the detergent MEGA-8. Our group has been 152 GONZALEZ & VICUÑA

unable to reproduce these results with P. 
acidovorans D3 and P. fluorescens biovar 
I. It is possible that the enzime in vivo 
catalyzes the reductive cleavage in an 
anaerobic microenvironment and that once 
homogeneized in crude extracts it becomes 
highly unstable. The stabilizing effect of 
the detergent points in this direction. This 
hypothesis could explain, at least partially, 
the difficulties encountered in the isolation 
of this enzyme. A similar situation may be 
occurring in the reductive dehalogenation 
of chlorinated aromatics. Crude extracts 
prepared from cells grown in aerobic con­
ditions either lack the enzymatic activity 
(13) or lose it unless ascorbate is added 
(14). 
All C6-C3 and C6-C2 intermediates 
identified so far possess a Q, in the keto 
form. Furthermore, /3-0-4 dimers with an 
hydroxyl group at the Ca position undergo 
Ca oxidation prior to cleavage (9, 10, 15). 
This requirement has also been observed 
with lignin tetramers (16). Pelmont et al. 
(17) were the first to describe a dehydro­
genase, isolated from Pseudomonas sp 
GU5, responsible for this reaction. Two 
dehydrogenases (DH-I and DH-II) with 
different substrate specificity have been 
found in Pseudomonas sp TMY1009 (18, 
19). Both enzymes catalyze redox reactions 
with /3-0-4 and 1,2-diarylpropane ()3-l) 
models, being DH-I more active with the 
latter and viceversa. Ca-Cj3 bond cleavage, a reaction com­
monly catalyzed by fungal lignin peroxi­
dase (LiP), has been observed in vivo with 
the actinomycete Corynebacterium equi 
ATCC 6939 (20) (Fig. IB). The identifica­
tion of an aromatic aldehyde and guaiacol 
during growth of Streptomyces cianeus 
on a /3-0-4 dimer also suggests Ca-Cj3 
cleavage (21). Ramachandra et al. recently 
described the extracellular production of a 
lignocellulose-induced peroxidase by Strep­
tomyces viridosporus T7A (22). The 
enzyme, called ALiPx for actinomycete 
lignin peroxidase, is present in the form of 
five isoenzymes (23). It oxidises several 
phenolic substrates and it is active also 
with /3-1 dimers. The authors propose that 
this peroxidase catalyzes Ca-Cj3 cleavage, 
although the products identified by GC-MS 
analysis, i.e., vanillin and guaiacol, are 
insufficient to support this proposition. 
The Ca-reduced dimers, whose formation 
could not be explained by the peroxidase 
action, are also found in the enzymatic 
assays. The formation of ALiPx in large 
amounts seems to be related with the use 
of larchwood xylan as an inducer (23). 
The failure of our group to detect in vivo 
modification of /3-0-4 dimers by S. viridos­
porus T7A may be related to the absence 
of an appropiate inducer in the cultures 
(24). Further work is necessary to assess 
the role of this peroxidase in APPL pro­
duction. BACTERIAL DEGRADATION OF LIGNIN 153 
Ca-Cp cleavage of a 0-0-4 dimer has also 
been found with Pseudomonas cepacia 122 
(25) and with an anaerobic consortium 
(26), as was discussed previously (1). 
Catabolism of 1,2-diarylpropane (ethane) 
and phenylcoumaran compounds 
Lignin substructures of the 1,2-diarylpro­
pane type possess the so called/3-1 linkage, 
whose frequency in natural lignin is about 
5-10% (8). Studies on bacterial degradation 
of these compounds are scarce, perhaps due 
to the difficulties in finding strains with the 
required enzymatic machinery (1). Only in 
1989, Habu et al. (27) reported for the first 
time the catabolism of the 1,2-diarylpropane 
dimer erythro-l,2-bis (4-hydroxy-3-metho-
xyphenyl)-l,3-propanediol by an isolated 
strains, namely Pseudomonas sp. TMY1009. 
The pathway starts with the oxidation of 
the Gy hydroxymethyl to a carboxyl 
group, followed by the double elimination 
of this group and the hydroxyl linked to 
Ca to give a stilbene intermediate. This 
molecule then undergoes oxidative Ca-Cj3 
cleavage producing tv/o molecules of 
vanillin (Fig. 2A). In close connection with 
this degradative pathway is the one reported for the metabolism of the phenylcoumaran 
structure dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol by 
the same strain (28) (Fig. 2B). In this case, 
cleavage of the Ca-oxygen bond of the 
cyclic ether results in a phenolic stilbene 
that is oxidatively cleaved between Ca and 
A novel dioxygenase has been isolated 
thereafter from this strain and shown to 
catalyze the oxidative cleavage of the 
double bond (29). Apparently, it requires 
no cofactor. Isotope experiments have 
confirmed the participation of molecular 
oxygen in the generation of the two 
aldehyde molecules. This enzyme, named 
lignostilbene a, /3-dioxygenase, has four 
isoenzymes. One of them, LSD-I, has 
been purified to homogeneity. It is a dimer 
of MW 94,000 and contains 1 g atom of 
iron per mol of enzyme (30). Crude pre­
parations of a,j3-dioxygenase convert natural 
stilbenes to aromatic aldehydes (31). 
A completely different pathway allows 
P. fluorescens biovar I to metabolize 
diary le thane ketols (32). The acyloin 
linkage in dimers such as anisoin or benzoin 
is cleaved by a highly specific thiamine 
pyrophosphate requiring lyase, yielding two 
molecules of the corresponding aromatic 
aldehyde (33) (Fig. 2C).

P. fluorescens biovar I. 154 GONZALEZ & VICUNA 
Catabolism of biphenyl structures 
About 10% of the lignin residues are linked 
through biphenyl bonds (8). Therefore, 
biphenyl structures have also been con­
sidered lignin model compounds (1). The 
pathway usually starts with a dioxygenase 
that forms a catechol, followed by ring 
fission catalyzed by a second dioxygenase. 
The C-C bond that constitutes the biphenyl 
linkage of the original molecule is cleaved 
much later in the pathway, after the 
second ring has also undergone fission. 
Breakdown of dehydrodivanillin in P. 
paucimobilis SYK-6 (34) seems to follow 
the same pathway found with an anaerobic 
consortium (35), which includes dehy-
drodivanillic acid, 5'-carboxy vanillic acid, 
vanillin and vanillic acid as intermediates. 
However, with crude extracts prepared 
from a recombinant component of the 
consortium, only vanillin was detected 
(36). Some of the genes that code for the 
enzymes involved in biphenyl degradation 
have been cloned (37-39). 
Effect of bacteria on high MW lignin 
preparations 
Since the action of bacteria on either 
natural or synthetic lignins is almost 
negligible (1), studies have focused on 
two areas: bacterial modification of in­
dustrial lignins and lignocellulose solu­
bilization by actinomycetes. 
Kraft lignin seems to be a rather good 
substrate for anaerobic bacteria, as measured 
either by mineralization (40, 41) or de-
polymerization (42). This has been an 
unexpected finding, not only because 
mineralization rates are the highest ever 
found with bacteria, but also because 
native lignin mineralization does not 
take place in anoxic environments (1, 43). 
Certainly, the biochemistry of this process 
deserves further study. On the other hand, 
aerobic bacteria do not affect Kraft lignin 
significantly (1), although strains can be 
isolated that grow on purified, low and 
high MW Kraft lignins as the only source 
of carbon and energy (44). A strain-specific 
consumption of aromatic acids present in 
the former has been reported (45), whereas the nature of chemical modifications 
brought about by bacteria on the latter has 
not been unraveled (Merino, A., personal 
communication). Since depolymerization 
has not been found, it is conceivable that 
bacteria may grow at the expense of 
abiotically released fragments. In constrast 
to Kraft lignin, the industry derived chloro-
lignins have not been found to support 
bacterial growth (46). 
The APPL-producing actinomycetes 
Termomonospora mesophila (47), Strep-
tomyces badius (47, 48) and S. viridos-
porus (48) can also incorporate carbon 
from Kraft lignin into biomass. However, 
this property is not shared by other fila­
mentous bacteria that are also able to 
produce APPL from grass lignocellulose 
(47). Another report concerning the effect 
of S. viridosporus T7A on two Kraft lignin 
fractions showed that this microorganism 
was not only unable to proliferate on the 
high MW fraction, but that growth on yeast 
extract was inhibited by the low MW 
fraction (49). The different behaviour of 
both S. viridosporus strains may be related 
to the source of Kraft lignin or to the 
fractionation-purification procedure of this 
substrate. 
As stated above, the enzymes involved 
in APPL formation by actinomycetes have 
not been identified with certainty. Accord­
ing to preliminary evidence, cellulases but 
not xylanases could play a role in this 
process (see ref. 1). ALiPx, which is also 
produced by S. badius (50), represents a 
good candidate for this function, but this 
has still to be determined. On the other 
hand, Mason et al. (51) have described a 
lignocellulosic solubilizing enzymatic ac­
tivity, which has not yet being charac­
terized. 
It has been shown that the aromatic 
moiety of APPL resist further attack by 
the strains that produce them (52, 53) and 
even by fungi (54). To date, no attention 
has been given to the action of non-fila­
mentous bacteria on APPL, with the 
exception of the work performed by 
Seelenfreund et al (55). These authors 
isolated natural strains in enrichment 
cultures containing APPL derived from 
wheat straw as the only source of carbon BACTERIAL DEGRADATION OF LIGNIN 155 
and energy. Three cultures were selected 
by these means: Pseudomonas E21, Pseu­
domonas B23 and a consortium composed 
of a Pseudomonas and an Enterobacter 
strain. Monosaccharide and thioacidolysis 
analyses after bacterial growth showed 
that these strains do not modify the APPL 
structure extensively. However, it was 
determined that Pseudomonas B23, which 
does not grow on lignin dimers, developed 
at the expense of guaiacyl and syringyl 
residues of the substrate. In contrast, Pseu­
domonas E21 and the consortium me­
tabolized a fraction of the sugar moieties 
without modifying the aromatic residues 
of APPL. On the other hand, P. fluorescens 
biovar I and P. acidovorans D3, both able 
to cleave the /3-0-4 linkage in lignin dimers, 
did not attack the guaiacyl and syringyl 
residues of APPL. These results show that 
there is no direct correlation between 
consumption of small lignin-related com­
pounds and ability to degrade polymeric 
lignin. 
Concluding remarks 
Current knowledge indicates that bacteria 
seem to lack a non-specific system able 
to carry out lignin combustion. However, 
it is not uncommon to find strains that 
can simultaneously degrade lignin dimers 
of different types. Good examples are 
Pseudomonas sp TMY1009 (/3-0-4, /3-1 
and phenylcoumaran structures) (9, 27, 
28), P. fluorescens biovar I (/3-0-4 and 
diarylethane structures) (11, 32), P. pauci-
mobilis SYK-6 (/3-0-4 and biphenyls) (12, 
34) and P. cruciviae S93B1 (diarylethane 
and biphenyls) (56). Specific, intracellular 
enzymes are in charge of the metabolism 
of each type of dimer. Alternatively, lig­
nin oligomers possessing different linkages 
can be degraded by mixed cultures (57, 
58). ALiPx might resemble fungal lignin 
peroxidase, although evidence reported to 
date is too preliminary to draw any con­
clusions in this respect. In turn, enzymes
