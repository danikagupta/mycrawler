Abstract
Isolated Enterococcus faecalis YZ 66 strain shows ability to decolorize various industrial dyes among which, it showed
complete decolorization and degradation of toxic, sulfonated recalcitrant diazo dye Direct Red 81 (50 mg/L) within
1.5 h of incubation under static anoxic condition. The optimum pH and temperature for decolorization was 7.0 and
40°C, respectively. Significant induction in the activity of intr acellular oxidoreductive enzymes suggested its involvement
in the decolorization of Direct Red 81. The biodegradati on of Direct Red 81 was monito red by UV-Visible, FT-IR
spectroscopy and HPLC. The final products were characte rized by GC-MS and possible pathway of the degradation
of the dye was proposed. The phytotoxi city assay (with respect to plants Sorghum vulgare and Phaseolus mungo )
revealed that the degradation of Direct Red 81 produced non toxic metabolites. Finally E. faecalis was employed to
decolorize actual industrial effluent showing decolor ization (in terms of ADMI val ue) with moderate COD and BOD
reduction. Moreover the result increas es the applicability of the strain for th e treatment of industrial wastewaters
containing dye pollutants.

Background
Azo dyes are xenobiotic compounds characterized by
the presence of one or more azo linkages and aromatic
rings [1]. They are the largest class of dyes with the
greatest variety of colour. At least 3000 different varieties
of azo dyes are extensively used in textile, paper, food, cos-
metics and pharmaceutical industries [2]. Among various
applications of synthetic dyes about 30,000 tons of differ-
ent dyestuffs are produced per year worldwide [3]. Among
these synthetic dyes, azo dyes are the most widely used
which account for over 60% of the total number of dyes
known to be manufactured [4,5]. Some investigators re-
ported that azo dyes and their metabolites are toxic, car-
cinogenic and mutagenic in nature which leads to the
formation of tumors and allergies besides growth inhib-
ition of bacteria, protozoan, algae, plants and different
animals [6,7].In India textile industry is one of the greatest genera-
tors of liquid effluent pollutants which are often con-
taminated with harmful or poisonous substances. An
estimate shows that textiles account for 14% (about
2200 dyeing industries) of India ’s industrial production
and around 27% of its export earnings [6]. However in
India particularly for small scale textile industries, where
working conditions and economic status do not allow
them to treat their wastewater before disposal and they
have no choice other than dumping all effluent into the
main stream of water resources. Thus dyes released from
the textile processing and dye stuff manufacturing indus-
tries results in increase in organic load of natural reser-
voirs. Pollution caused by dye effluents is mainly due to
durability of dyes in wastewater, colour fastness, stability
and resistance of dyes to degradation [8]. During industrial
processing up to 40% of the used dyestuff are released into
the process water producing highly coloured wastewater
that affect aesthetics, water transparency and gas solubility
in water bodies [9,10].
Several physical and chemical methods have been sug-
gested for the treatment of dye contaminated wastewater* Correspondence: sahasrabudhemadhuri@gmail.com ;gdsaratale28@gmail.com

lution that can be generated by excessive use of chemi-
cals [11]. In contrast, microbial degradation of dyes does
not have similar problems so it is necessary to establish
biological wastewater treatment of azo dyes [12]. Cur-
rently microbial biodegradation became a promising ap-
proach of dye treatment because of its cheaper, effective
and more ecofriendly in nature [2]. Varieties of microor-
ganisms including bacteria, fungi, yeasts, actinomycetes,
algae and plants are capable of removing dyes from dye
effluent, and become an inexpensive and promising tool
for the removal of various dyes from textile dye effluents
[6]. Among which bacterial cells represent an inexpensive
and promising tool for the removal of various azo dyes
from textile dye effluents. Recently a substantial amount of
research has been carried out using single bacterial cultures
like; Lysinibacillus sp. RGS; Pseudomonas luteola ,Bacillus
fusiformis KMK5, Micrococcus glutamicus NCIM-2168,
and Aeromonas hydrophila shows very promising results
for the azo dye decolorization [4,5,11,13].
Enterococcus faecalis is a nonmotile, facultatively an-
aerobic coccus and can survive very harsh environments.
Enterococcus sp. was found to be catabolically versatile
with the ability to utilize a wide range of unusual sub-
strates such as; chlorpyrifos, pentaerythritol tetranitrate,
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and phosphonate [14]. Biological
neutralization of an alkaline effluent by an alkaliphile,
Enterococcus faecium strain R-5 was reported earlier [15].
Recently Pingitore et al. (2012), reported the importance of
Enterococcus sp. in dairy industries increases the biotech-
nological value of this strain [16]. A bacterial consortium,
NAR-2 consisting of Citrobacter freundii A1,Enterococcus
casseliflavus C1 and Enterobacter cloacae L17 was investi-
gated for biodegradation of Amaranth azo dye (100 mg/l)
in 30 min under sequential microaerophilic –aerobic condi-
tion [17]. Recently expression and characterization of an
aerobic FMN-dependent azoreductase from Enterococcus
faecalis was also reported [18].
The mechanism of microbial degradation of azo dyes
involves the reductive cleavage of azo bonds ( −N=N –)
with the help of azoreductas e under anaerobic conditions
resulted into the formation of colorless solutions [11]. For
the reduction of azo dyes, reduction to the anion radical
occurs by a fast one-electron transfer reaction, followed by
a second, slower electron transfer event to produce the
stable dianion [19]. Thus the functional group of azo dye
with higher electronic density might be unfavorable to
this second electron transfer to form the dianion and leads
to low or no decolorization [12]. Due to this reason
sulfonated reactive group of azo dyes are normally consid-
ered to be more recalcitrant than carboxylated azo dyes.
Some investigators reported that the rate limiting step dur-
ing bacterial decolorization of sulfonated azo dyes is the
permeation through the bacterial cell membrane [4,20].In this study, we have used isolated Enterococcus fae-
calis YZ 66 to decolorize Direct Red 81 (DR 81). The
isolated strain could decolorize DR 81 completely up
to 500 mg/L. We have optimized various physico-
chemical parameters and studied enzymatic status during
decolorization. Supplementation of carbon and nitrogen
source on decolorization performance, identification of
metabolites formed after decolorization using analytical
techniques and toxicity study of metabolites formed after
decolorization were systematically investigated.
Material and methods
Microorganism and culture conditions
Enterococcus faecalis YZ 66 was isolated from dye indus-
try effluent contaminated soils [21] this strain was accli-
matized with dye waste obtained from Spectrum Dyes
and Chemicals Industry, Surat, India, containing DR81
in higher proportion by a method of Peppler (1979) [22].
The method included two steps: treatability test was car-
ried out by enrichment culture technique and toxicity
test in which toxicity was assessed in a series of parallel
flasks with geometrically increasing concentration of
DR81. Microbial growth was measured daily by turbid-
ity. The concentration at which the toxic components
inhibited growth was noted and was used as a warning
of an upper concentration limit. Pure culture was main-
tained on the nutrient agar slants. Composition of nutri-
ent broth and agar used for decolorization is (g/L)
peptic digest of animal tissue 5, NaCl 5, beef extract 1.5,
yeast extract 1.5 and pH 7.4 ± 0.2.
Dyestuff and chemicals
The dye Direct Red 81 (DR 81) and actual dye effluent
were obtained from Spectrum Dyes and Chemicals
I n d u s t r y ,S u r a t ,I n d i a .2 ′-2′Azinobis-(3 ethylbenthiazoline-
6 sulphonate) (ABTS) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich,
USA. Nutrient broth dehydrated was purchased from
Hi-Media, Mumbai, India. Tartaric acid, n-propanol was
purchased from Qualigenes, India. All chemicals used were
of the highest purity and of analytical grade.
Decolorization studies
Enterococcus faecalis YZ 66 was grown for 24 h at 37°C
on nutrient agar [21]. 10% inoculum (O.D 6001.0) was
used throughout the study [8,23]. The isolated strain
was inoculated in nutrient broth to study the decoloriz-
ing ability of the culture. The dye was filter sterilized
by using 0.2 μm filter (Sartorius Biolab, Germany) and
added after sterilization of medium throughout the study.
The dye (50 mg/L) was added immediately and incubated
under static condition at 37°C. Aliquot (3 mL) of cul-
ture media was withdrawn at different time intervals
and centrifuged at 6000×g for 20 min. Decolorization
was monitored by measuring the absorbance of theSahasrabudhe et al. Journal of Environmental Health Science & Engineering  (2014) 12:151 Page 2 of 13culture at λmaxof the dye i.e. 511 nm and change in pH
was also recorded. Sterile nutrient broth of different pH 3,
4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 was inoculated with 10% inoculum and in-
cubated at 37°C under static condition. The dye concen-
tration was 50 mg/L. For temperature studies sterile
nutrient broth of pH 7.0 was inoculated with 10% inocu-
lum and filter sterilized dye at 50 mg/L was added
aseptically. The broth was incubated at 25°C, 30°C,
37°C, 40°C, 45°C and 50°C. All decolorization experiments
were performed in triplicates. Abiotic control (without
microorganism) was always included in each study.
In order to examine the effect of initial dye concen-
tration on decolorization 50 –700 mg/L of DR81 was
added to the sterile nutrient broth inoculated with 10%
inoculum of Enterococcus faecalis YZ 66 (O.D 6001.0)
and incubated at 37°C under static condition. The %
decolorization was measured. All decolorization experi-
ments were performed in triplicates. In each study abi-
otic control (without culture) was always included. The %
decolorization and average decolorization rate was mea-
sured [5] as follows:

Effect of supplementation of carbon and nitrogen sources
on decolorization
To study the effect of carbon and nitrogen sources on
decolorization of DR81, semi s ynthetic medium [8] having
following composition was used (g/L); (NH 4)2SO4;0.28,
NH 4Cl; 0.23, KH 2PO 4;0 . 0 6 7 ,M g S O 4.7H 2O; 0.04,
CaCl 2.2H 2O; 0.022, FeCl 3.6H 2O; 0.005, yeast extract;
0.2, NaCl; 0.15, NaHCO 3; 1.0 and 1 ml/L of trace
element solution containing (g/L) ZnSO 4.7H2O; 0.01,
MnCl 2.4H 2O; 0.1, CuSO 4.5H 2O; 0.392, COCl 2.6H 2O;
0.248, NaB 4O7.7H 2O; 0.177 and NiCl 2.6H 2O; 0.02. It was
further incorporated with different carbon and nitrogen
sources (1% each) such as glucose, sucrose, lactose and
starch, yeast extract, peptone, malt extract, meat extract
and urea respectively. Filter sterilized dye 50 mg/L of the
DR81 was added after inoculation of Enterococcus faecalis
YZ 66 in sterilized media.
Repeated dye decolorization in fed batch process
Decolourization medium containing 50 mg/L DR 81 was
inoculated with 24 h grown cells of Enterococcus faecalis
YZ 66. The resulting solution was then statically incu-
bated at 37°C for the decolorization. After complete
colour removal, the cells were collected, rinsed twice
with sterile deionized water and transferred into a fresh
decolorization medium for the second decolorization
batch experiment. The same procedures were repeated
seven times. All steps were done under aseptic condi-
tions. For comparison, the repeated batch experimentswere also conducted using free cells under identical ex-
perimental procedures.
Preparation of the cell free extract
Enterococcus faecalis YZ 66 was grown in nutrient broth
at 37°C for 24 h and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 mi-
nutes. The cell pellet was suspended in the potassium
phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) keeping sonifier out-
put at 50 amp and giving 7 strokes each of 30 seconds
with a 2 min interval at 4°C. The homogenate was cen-
trifuged and supernatant was used as a source of en-
zymes. A similar procedure was followed to the cells
ofEnterococcus faecalis YZ 66 obtained after complete
decolorization.
Oxidative and reductive enzyme assays
The activities of laccase and lignin peroxidase were
assayed spectrophotometrically in the cell free extract.
Laccase activity was determined in a 2 mL mixture con-
taining ABTS (10%) in 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 4.9 and
measured as an increase in optical density at 420 nm
[21]. Lignin peroxidase (LiP) activity was determined by
monitoring the propanaldehyde formed at 300 nm in a re-
action mixture of 2.5 mL containing 100 mM n-propanol,
250 mM tartaric acid and 10 mM H 2O2[13]. All enzyme
assays were carried out at 37°C with reference blanks that
contained all components except the enzyme to be assayed.
All enzyme assays were conducted in triplicates and the
average rates were calculated to represent the enzyme ac-
tivity. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as a change
in absorbance U/mL/min of the enzyme. NADH-DCIP re-
ductase and azoreductase activity was carried out as per
the method reported by Saratale (2013) [13].
Decolorization of dye industry effluent
For the dye wastewater study, anaerobically digested ef-
fluent was used for further aerobic treatment by using
the selected isolate in pure culture and the effluent
was checked for COD and BOD [24]. For color removal
efficiencies of dye wastewater the true color level inde-
pendent of hue was measured using the American Dye
Manufacturers ’Institute (ADMI 3WL) tristimulus fil-
ter method. This method is applicable to colored wa-
ters and wastewaters having color characteristic. The
decolorization of actual dye wastewater by Enterococcus
faecalis was determined by measuring ADMI from the
aqueous solutions. ADMI removal percent (%) is the ratio
between the removal ADMI value at any contact time
and the ADMI value at initial concentration was calcu-
lated [5]. To understand the degree of biodegradation
(mineralization) of dye wastewater reduction in chemical
oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand
(BOD) of the culture before and after incubation with
Enterococcus faecalis YZ 66 was measured [24]. TheSahasrabudhe et al. Journal of Environmental Health Science & Engineering  (2014) 12:151 Page 3 of 13nutrient medium was used as blank and similar condition
was used for test.
Analytical methods
The metabolites produced during the biodegradation of
DR81 at 1.5 h i.e. after decolorization of the medium
were extracted twice with equal volume of dichloro-
methane (DCM). The DCM extracts were pooled and
evaporated at 40°C in a rotary evaporator and then
transferred to a test tube [25]. The extracted residue was
dissolved in a small volume of HPLC grade methanol
and used for analysis. During UV visible spectral ana-
lysis, changes in absorption spectrum in the decolorized
medium (400-800 nm) was recorded in comparison with
the spectra of the undegraded dye [5]. HPLC analysis
was performed in an isocratic system (Shimadzu SCL 10
AVP) equipped with dual absorbance detector using
C-18 column with HPLC grade methanol as mobile
phase at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min for 10 min at
511 nm. The mobile phase used for TLC was composed
of methanol: ethyl acetate: n-propanol: water: acetic acid
(1:2:3:1:0.2 v/v) and the separation was done on pre-
coated silica gel plates ‘Merck ’. TLC plate was devel-
oped using iodine chamber [8]. Metabolites formed
after decolorization of DR81 were characterized by using
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer
1000) (FTIR) Analysis was done in the mid IR region of
400-4000/Cm with 16 scan speed, the pellets prepared
using spectrophotometric pure KBr (5:95) were fixed in
sample holder and analysis was carried out. Extracted
metabolites were subjected to FTIR. The metabolites
formed after decolorization was identified by using Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (Shimadzu GC-MS
QP2010). The ionization voltage was 70 eV. Gas chroma-
tography was conducted in temperature programming
mode with a Resteck column (0.25 mmX 30 mm). The
initial column temperature was 40°C for 4 min, which
was increased linearly at 10°C /min up to 270°C and held
at 4 min. The temperature of injection port was 275°C
and GC-MS interface was maintained at 300°C. The
helium was carrier gas; flow rate 1 mL/min and 30 min
run time.
Toxicity studies
Phytotoxicity tests were carried out in order to assess
the toxicity of DR81 and metabolites formed after
decolorization. Phytotoxicity tests were carried out at a
final concentration of 400 ppm on two kinds of seeds.
One from grains i.e. Sorghum vulgare (monocot) and sec-
ond from pulses i.e. Phaseolus mungo (dicot), commonly
cultivated in India. Phytotoxicity was conducted at room
temperature (10 seeds of each) by watering separately
5 ml sample of control DR81 and its degradation prod-
ucts per day. Control set was irrigated using distilledwater at the same time. Germination % as well as the
length of plumule and radical was recorded after 7 days
of incubation [8].
Statistical analysis
Data was analyzed by one way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Tukey- Kramer multiple comparison test.
Readings were considered significant when P was ≤0.05.
Results and discussion
Decolorization experiment
The isolated Enterococcus faecalis YZ 66 was able to
decolorize DR 81 within 1.5 h at a dye concentration
of 50 mg/L. UV visible scan of the culture supernatant
withdrawn at different time intervals indicated the
decolorization and decrease in dye concentration from
batch culture. Peak obtained at 511 nm disappeared after
complete decolorization. The absorbance peak in the vis-
ible region disappeared indicating complete decolorization.
In the UV spectra, the peak at 511 nm was replaced by
new peak at 240 nm (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The ab-
sorbance peaks in the visible r egion disappeared indicating
complete decolorization [26]. Decolorization with respect
to time showed complete decolorization of the dye in
1.5 hours. There was proportionate increase in wet weight
indicating growth of E. faecalis in the presence of dye
(Additional file 1: Figure S2). There was no abiotic loss
of DR 81 within 24 h incubation indicating that the
decolorization of DR 81 was due to biological mech-
anism rather than adsorption. To confirm whether this
decolorization is due to the variation in pH, change in pH
was recorded which is in the range of 7.0 ± 0.2.
Effect of physicochemical conditions on the
decolorization performance
The effect of various physiochemical conditions such as
pH, temperature, dye concentration, carbon and nitro-
gen sources on decolorization of DR 81 by E. faecalis
was studied in detail. All parameters were studied at 37°C
under static condition. 10% inoculum A 6001.0 was used at
a dye concentration 50 mg/L.
Effect of pH
It was observed that pH of the media, affects the colour
of the solution and the solubility of the dye and the en-
zymatic activity related to decolorization is also dependent
on the pH. Generally bacterial cultures exhibit maximum
decolorization at pH values near 7 or slightly alkaline pH
values and the rate of colour removal tends to decrease
rapidly at strongly acidic or slightly alkaline pH values
[12,27]. E. faecalis showed complete decolorization of DR
81 at pH 7.0 within 1.5 h. It showed decolorization in the
pH range of 5 –8 while at pH 3 and 4 (about 40%) and
at pH 9 and 10 about (about 30%) decolorization wasSahasrabudhe et al. Journal of Environmental Health Science & Engineering  (2014) 12:151 Page 4 of 13observed after 24 hour of incubation (Additional file 1:
Figure S3). Similar results were observed in Micrococcus
sp. in the decolorization of 300 mg/L of Orange MR [28].
Effect of temperature
Pearce et al., (2003) [12] reported that the rate of colour
removal increases with increasing temperature within
a defined range that depends upon the system. The
temperature required to produce the maximum rate of
colour removal tends to correspond with the optimum
cell culture growth temperature which is in the range of
35-45°C. Temperature affects microbial growth, enzymes
production and consequently, the percentage of deco-
louration. It was reported by Mathew and Madamwar,
2004 [23] that various microorganisms showed their sur-
vival at various temperatures ranging from 25-50°C. The
decline in colour removal activity at higher temperature
can be attributed to the loss of cell viability or to the de-
naturation of azoreductase enzyme. However, it has been
shown that with certain whole bacterial cell preparation,
azo reductase enzyme is relatively thermostable and can
remain active up to temperature of 60°C over short
period of time [29]. E. faecalis YZ 66 decolorized the dye
under study in the range of 96-99% within a temperature
of 30-40°C. At 30°C, 99.35% decolorization was observed
while at 40°C, 98.54% decolorization was seen, thus
showing negligible difference in percent decolorization
at both the temperatures (Additional file 1: Figure S3).
At 45°C and 50°C, 17.85 and 14.81% decolorization
was observed, respectively (Additional file 1: Figure S3).
Similar results was observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosadegrades 97% of Remazol Red (50 mg/L) at 40°C, 72% at
10°C and 82% at 30°C, respectively [30].
Effect of initial dye concentration
Decolorization of different initial concentrations of the
dye from 50 –700 mg/L was studied under static anoxic
condition. Rate of decolorization of dye increased with
increase in concentration of the dye up to 300 mg/L
but the time required for decolorization was more. The
E. faecalis showed faster decolorizing ability up to
300 mg/L after which the rate of decolorization falls de-
creasing (Figure 1). Fifty four hours are required to
decolourize 85.74% of the dye at 500 mg/L concen-
tration. The activity was lower at dye concentration
600 mg/L and above which decolorization was strongly
inhibited at dye concentration at 700 mg/L (Figure 1). It
has been proposed that dye concentration can influence
the efficiency of microbial decolorization through com-
bination of factors imposed by dye at high dye concentra-
tion [31]. Similar results were observed in Lysinibacillus
sp. (for Metanil Yellow) [32], Sphingomonas paucimobilis
(for Methyl Red) [33], and in Lysinibacillus sp. RGS
(for Remazol Red) [13].
Effect of supplementation of carbon and nitrogen sources
on the decolorization performance
Dyes are deficient in carbon and thus biodegradation
without supplying extra carbon or nitrogen source is
very difficult [34]. Carbon and nitrogen sources have an
important influence on the extent of decolouration using
microorganisms. In order to enhance the decolorization

source was supplied in semi synthetic medium. There
was no decolorization observed in semi synthetic
medium. In the presence of lactose 98.12% decolouriza-
tion was observed followed by 96.16, 95.25, 95.61 and
93.76% in the presence of meat extract, peptone, glucose
and starch, respectively while less decolourization with
other supplements of carbon and nitrogen source within
24 h of incubation (Additional file 1: Figure S4). In
addition, supplying urea as a nitrogen source did not en-
hance decolorizing ability. Different microbial metabolic
characteristics lead to di fferences in the uptake of
sources, thus affecting azo dye decolorization. Addition of
carbon source found to be less effective to promote the
decolorization performance probably due to the prefer-
ence of the cells in assimilating the added carbon sources
over using the dye compound as the carbon source [6,35].
Nitrogen sources are found important for microbial deco-
louration since it was observed that this source is essential
for the regeneration of NADH [6,35].
Decolorization with repeated addition of dye aliquots
An ability of E. faecalis YZ 66 to decolorize repeated
addition of DR 81 dye aliquot (50 mg/L) was studied
under static condition. The isolate have an ability to
decolorize 100% dye up to seventh aliquot and after that
subsequent cycle showed no decolorization (Additional
file 1: Figure S5). The eventual cessation of decolorization
was likely due to nutrient depletion [5]. Thus E. faecalis
YZ 66 showed the ability to decolorize repeated addition
of the dye aliquots is noteworthy for its commercial
application.Enzymes involved in dye decolorization
The use of microbial techniques to deal with pollution is
a key research area in the environmental sciences. In
these processes microbes acclimatize themselves to the
toxic wastes and resistant strains develop naturally,

harmful forms. The mechanism behind the biodegradation
of recalcitrant compounds (azo dyes) in the microbial sys-
tem is based on the action of the biotransformation en-
zymes [36]. Besides uptake, the presence and activity of a
network of detoxification enzymes is crucial for the me-
tabolism and eventually the degradation of chemicals. To
understand the decolorization mechanism, enzyme activ-
ities of laccase, lignin peroxidase, NADH-DCIP reductase,
and azo reductase were monitored over time. The en-
hanced activities of enzymes were noted in induced cells
(after decolorization) (Figure 2). The enzymatic profile
presumably indicates communal action of oxidoreductive
enzymes for the degradation of DR 81 into simple metabo-
lites by E. faecalis (Figure 2). No enzyme activities were
observed in cell free supernatant. The role of oxidoreduc-
tive enzymes in the decolorization of azo dyes have beencharacterized in various bacteria are well documented in
recent reviews [6,37].
Decolorization studies of dye wastewater by E. faecalis
Most of the microbial decolorization studies in several
laboratories showed the ability of bacteria, fungi, and
algae in removing the color of textile dyes, but they do
not find much application in treatment system for in-
dustrial effluent because of heterogeneity of the compo-
nents in effluent depending upon production schedule.
However, it is very important to test decolorization in
real textile effluents, which are complex systems having
strong colors, large amounts of suspended solids, broadly
fluctuating pHs, high temperatures, high COD and high
salt concentrations that can be inhibitory to microorgan-
isms [13]. Considering this perspective we have checked
the efficiency of E. faecalis to decolorize actual textile

by using ADMI 3WL suggesting that E. faecalis could
achieve higher color removal value (52%) with moderatereduction in COD (about 42%) and BOD (about 48%) after
10 days of incubation (Figure 3). Decolorization perform-
ance of dye wastewater by E. faecalis is comparable with

[38]. Untreated dye effluents cause serious environmental
and health hazards whereas in aqueous ecosystems is aes-
thetically unpleasant and leads to a reduction in sunlight
penetration, dissolved oxygen concentration and had acute
toxic effects on aquatic flora and fauna. This study is
of particular relevance since the Panchganga river and
Ichalkaranji area near Kolhapur, India are heavily industri-
alized, with significant wastewater discharge from textile
and dye manufacturing industries which causes the harm-
ful impacts to the environment. Our strain E. faecalisshowed better colour removal of actual dye wastewater
with significant reduction in COD and could be a poten-
tial strain for the treatment of textile dyestuffs and textile
and dye industry effluent via appropriate bioreactor opera-
tions and will be useful to small textile industries in an
ecoefficient and economically feasible that could effect-
ively decolorize and detoxify dye containing wastewater.
Analysis of metabolites resulting from decolorization
To understand and confirm the possible mechanism of
dye decolorization, analysis of products of biodegrad-

spot in the sample containing the extracted metabolites
of completely decolorized medium with R fvalue 0.71
where as R fvalue of DR 81 was noted as 0.97 confirming
the biodegradation of DR 81 by E.faecalis YZ 66. HPLC
elution profile of DR81 showed a distinct single peak at
retention time of 1.71. min. Three peaks at retention
time of 3.008, 3.861 and 4.021 min were showed that the
degradation of DR 81 into different products by E. faeca-
lisYZ 66. Disappearance of a distinct peak of DR81 con-
firmed the degradation of the dye. HPLC analysis of
metabolites formed after biodegradation of DR 81
showed the peaks with different retention times than the
original dye which indicates the biodegradation of DR 81
into different metabolites (Figure 4A and B).
The FTIR spectrum of a control dye and metabolites
was compared. The spectrum of the control dye displayed
ap e a ka t3 7 8 9 . 4 4c m−1and 3491.49 cm−1N-H stretching.
The peak at 1658.48 cm−1represents N = N symmetric
stretch. A peak at 1563.99 cm−1represents N-H bending.
A peak at 1224.58 cm−1represents C-O stretch band of
phenol. The peaks at 1121.4 and 1057.76 cm−1represents
C-N stretch along with O = S = O symmetric stretch. The
peaks at 616, 712 and 852.382 cm−1represents C-H of
substituted aromatics. FTIR spectrum of metabolitesobtained after decolorization showed peaks at 3994.35 cm−1
and 3690.54 cm−1represents phenolic –OH group,
3054.53 cm−1represents = C-H stretch, 2987.28 cm−1
showed –C-H stretch and 1265.37 cm−1represented –C-O
stretching vibrations (Figure 5 A and B).
To verify the degradation products formed during dye
decolorization by E. faecalis ,G C –MS analysis was car-
ried out. The low molecular weight aromatic compounds
were produced from the degradation of Direct Red 81 by
E. faecalis . Accordingly, the pathway for the degradation
of Direct Red 81 is proposed as depicted in Figure 6,
showing various steps involved in the degradation mech-
anism. However, very little is known about the nature of
the degradation products formed in these reactions
(Table 1) and the reaction mechanism about oxidoreduc-
tive enzymes. We propose that initially primary reduc-
tive cleavage in azo bond of Direct Red 81 results in
the product such as, sodium-4-aminobenzenesulfonate,
1,4-benzenediamine and 7-benzylamino-3-dibenzyl-1-4-
hydroxy naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid. Further deamination
of sodium-4-aminobenzenesulfonate results into sodium
benzenesulfonate with a mass peak of 178. Whereas
the asymmetric cleavage of product 7-benzylamino-3-
dibenzyl-1-4-hydroxy naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid by oxi-
dative enzymes (laccase) resulted in the formation ofTable 1 Mass spectrum data of degraded products of C.I. Direct Red 81 by Enterococcus faecalis YZ 66 (Continued)

products. Further deamination reaction resulting in the
formation of low molecular weight compound such as
naphthalene as a final product (Figure 6). Therefore, ana-
lytical studies confirmed the biodegradation of Direct
Red 81 dye, in which the smaller molecular weight inter-
mediates are formed by the consecutive action of oxidor-
eductive enzymes present in E. faecalis .
Phytotoxicity studies
Untreated or partially treated effluent may be disposed
off in the water bodies and this water can be used for ir-
rigation purpose. Thus it was found necessary to study
phytotoxicity of the dye before and after degradation.
The relative sensitivities towards the dye DR 81 and its
degradation products in relation to Sorghum vulgare and
Phaseolus mungo seeds were represented in the Table 2.
There was no significant difference in the root and shoot
length in case of the selected plants irrigated with the
dye but in case of metabolites irrigated selected plants
root and shoot length was significantly increased ( P≤0.05)
as compared to control. Phytotoxicity study showed good
germination rate as well as significant growth in the plum-
ule and radical for both the plants ( P≤0.05) in the metabo-
lites extracted after decolorization as compared to dye
sample. This indicates the detoxification of DR 81 by
E. faecalis . Hence this indigenous bacterial strain could be
a good biocatalyst for the treatment of textile dyes and ef-
fluent containing dyes.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that isolated Enterococcus fae-
calis YZ 66 was able to degrade and detoxify the toxic
sulfonated azo dye Direct Red 81 under static condition.
Enzyme analysis indicated prime involvement of oxidor-
eductive enzymes in the decolorization process. The
COD and BOD measurement showed mineralization of
Direct Red 81 and phytotoxicity studies shows nontoxic
residual metabolites. Analytical studies of extracted prod-
ucts confirmed the biodegradation of Direct Red 81 by
Enterococcus faecalis YZ 66. A possible pathway for bio-
degradation of this dye was proposed with the help of
GC-MS analysis. This strain also showed better colour
removal of dye industry wastewater with significant re-
duction in COD and BOD and could be a potential strain
for the treatment of textile dyestuffs and dye industry ef-
fluent by using appropriate bioreactor.
