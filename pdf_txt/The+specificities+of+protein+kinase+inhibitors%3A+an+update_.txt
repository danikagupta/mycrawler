The speciﬁcities of 65 compounds reported to be relatively
speciﬁc inhibitors of protein kinases have been proﬁled against a
panel of 70–80 protein kinases. On the basis of this information,the effects of compounds that we have studied in cells and otherdata in the literature, we recommend the use of the following
small-molecule inhibitors: SB 203580/SB202190 and BIRB 0796
to be used in parallel to assess the physiological roles of p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) isoforms, PI-103 and
wortmannin to be used in parallel to inhibit phosphatidylinositol
(phosphoinositide) 3-kinases, PP1 or PP2 to be used in parallelwith Src-I1 (Src inhibitor-1) to inhibit Src family members;
PD 184352 or PD 0325901 to inhibit MKK1 (MAPK kinase-
1) or MKK1 plus MKK5, Akt-I-1/2 to inhibit the activationof PKB (protein kinase B/Akt), rapamycin to inhibit TORC1
[mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)–raptor (regulatory
associated protein of mTOR) complex], CT 99021 to inhibitGSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), BI-D1870 and SL0101or FMK (ﬂuoromethylketone) to be used in parallel to inhibit
RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase), D4476 to inhibit CK1 (casein
kinase 1), VX680 to inhibit Aurora kinases, and roscovitine asa pan-CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor. We have also
identiﬁed harmine as a potent and speciﬁc inhibitor of DYRK1A
(dual-speciﬁcity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase1A)in vitro . The results have further emphasized the need for
considerable caution in using small-molecule inhibitors of protein
kinases to assess the physiological roles of these enzymes. Despitebeing used widely, many of the compounds that we analysed weretoo non-speciﬁc for useful conclusions to be made, other than to
exclude the involvement of particular protein kinases in cellular
processes.
Key words: anti-cancer drugs, drug discovery, inhibitor speci-
ﬁcity, kinase proﬁling, protein kinase.
INTRODUCTION
Small cell-permeant inhibitors of protein kinases have become
invaluable reagents with which to investigate the physiological
roles of protein kinases, because they can be used simply and rap-idly to block endogenous kinase activity in normal cells and
tissues, as well as transformed cell lines. In recent years a plethora
of protein kinase inhibitors have become available commercially,and researchers are often faced with a bewildering variety ofcompounds from which to choose from, each compound being
purported to be a ‘speciﬁc’ inhibitor of a particular protein kinase.
It is therefore difﬁcult to decide which compound will switch offthe activity of the protein kinase or signalling pathway under
investigation, both effectively and speciﬁcally.
There are some 500 protein kinases encoded by the human
genome, most of which are members of the same superfamily,so that the issue of selectivity is critical. Seven years ago we
studied 28 commonly used protein kinase inhibitors and examined
their speciﬁcities against a panel of 24 different protein kinases[1], and a few years later we extended this analysis to a further14 compounds against a slightly larger panel [2]. These studies
revealed that a number of ‘speciﬁc’ inhibitors affected so many
protein kinases as to render meaningless the conclusions madeabout the role of a particular kinase by the use of these compounds.

These studies appear to have been useful to the cell-signalling
community, as judged by the number of times that the ﬁrst paper
[1] was downloaded from the Biochemical Journal website in
2004 (7600 times) and cited in other papers (over 1500 times).
Over the past few years, we have increased the size of our core
‘proﬁling’ panel from 30 to over 70 protein kinases and have
used this enlarged panel to examine further the speciﬁcities ofmany protein kinase inhibitors. Here we present information about
the speciﬁcities of 65 inhibitors and make recommendations
about their use. It should be noted that each protein kinasewas assayed at or below the K
mfor ATP, explaining why the
IC50values for some protein kinase inhibitors are lower than
those reported in previously published papers where a higher(0.1 mM) concentration of ATP was employed in the assays. These
lower concentrations of ATP not only allow a more stringent test
of the speciﬁcities of protein kinase inhibitors, but also reduce thecost of performing this expensive analysis.

Unless stated otherwise, all protein kinases were of human originand encoded full-length proteins. Apart from the AMPK (AMP-
activated protein kinase) complex, which was puriﬁed from ratliver, all other proteins were either expressed as GST (glutathione
transferase) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli or as hexahistidine
(His
6)-tagged proteins in Sf21 ( Spodoptera frugiperda 21)
insect cells. GST fusion proteins were puriﬁed by afﬁnitychromatography on glutathione–Sepharose, and His
6-tagged

Activation of protein kinases
In order to produce activated forms of Aurora B and AuroraC, insect Sf21 cells were incubated for 1 h with the protein
phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (50 nM), whereas, to produceactivated PLK1, the Sf21 cells were incubated for 4 h with
100 nM okadaic acid prior to harvesting the cells and purifying
the enzyme. MKK1 (MAPK kinase-1) was activated with c-Raf,wild-type and mutant JNK isoforms with MKK4 and MKK7,p38 MAPK isoforms with MKK6, MAPKAP-K2, MAPKAP-
K3, PRAK (p38-regulated activated kinase), MNK1, MNK2 and

plus PDK1; PKB α,P K B β, SGK1 and S6K1 with PDK1, and
ERK1 and ERK2 with MKK1. To activate CDK2, bacterial pellets
expressing cyclin A2 and CDK2 were mixed together, lysed, thenpuriﬁed on glutathione–Sepharose. The GST tags were removed
by cleavage with PreScission protease and the CDK2–cyclin A2
complex was puriﬁed by chromatography on SP (sulfopropyl)-Sepharose. It was then activated with CAK1/CDK7 followed
by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetate–agarose to remove
CAK1/CDK7, which binds to this column by virtue of its C-terminal His
6tag. All the other protein kinases were active as
expressed.

temperature (21◦C) and were linear with respect to time and
enzyme concentration under the conditions used. Assays were
performed for 30 min using Multidrop Micro reagent dispensers(Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) in a 96-well format. The concentration of magnesium acetate in the assays

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB 203580, SB 202190, BIRB 0796)
SB 203580 [23] and its close relative SB 202190 have been ex-
ploited in thousands of reported studies to assess the physiologicalroles of p38 αand p38 βMAPKs. Although these compounds have
been, and still are, very useful, more recent studies have identiﬁed
other protein kinases that they inhibit with similar (GAK and CK1)or even greater (RIP2) potency [24]. SB 203580 also inhibits c-Raf
[25] and GSK3 in vitro (Table 1), albeit less strongly, and inhibits

the formation of ZMP (aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1- β-D-
ribofuranoside monophosphate), an activator of AMPK, from its
inactive precursor AICAR (aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1- β-
D-ribofuranoside), probably by inhibiting adenosine transporters
[26]. Thus there is a danger that the observed effects of SB
203580/SB 202190 on cells result from the inhibition of a target(s)
distinct from p38 α/p38βMAPKs. This inherent problem can be
overcome by examining whether the effects of these compounds
are no longer observed in cells that express an SB 203580-resistant
mutant of p38 αMAPK [27] or p38 βMAPK, or by studying
whether the results obtained with SB 203580 are also observed in
cells from knockout mice that do not express p38 αMAPK (see,
e.g., [28]) and/or p38 βMAPK. However, although p38 βMAPK-
deﬁcient mice are viable, p38 αMAPK-deﬁcient mice display
embryonic lethality, and studies with p38 αMAPK knockout cells
have so far been conﬁned to the use of embryonic ﬁbroblasts. Theavailability of inhibitors that are more speciﬁc than SB 203580and SB 202190 would therefore be very useful.
BIRB 0796 is a more potent inhibitor of p38 αand p38 βMAPKs
than is SB 203580. It interacts with p38 αMAPK in a manner
distinct from that exhibited by SB 203580/SB 202190, and its
binding induces a slow conformational change that locks the
protein into an inactive conformation. Thus the potency of BIRB0796 increases with the period of preincubation with the inhibitor
[29]. In contrast with SB 203580 or SB 202190, we ﬁnd that
BIRB 0796 does not inhibit CK1 δ,G S K 3 β, RIP2 or GAK in vitro
(Table 1). However, unlike SB 203580/SB202190, BIRB 0796
also inhibits p38 γMAPK, p38 δMAPK and JNK2 α2 (Table 1). As
judged by suppression of the phosphorylation of well-establishedsubstrates, BIRB 0796 inhibits p38 αMAPK activity completely
when added to the culture medium at only 0.1 µM, but at
1µM it also inhibits p38 γMAPK. Thus substrates for p38 γ
MAPK (and perhaps p38 δMAPK) can be identiﬁed as proteins
whose phosphorylation is unaffected at 0.1 µM BIRB 0796, but
inhibited at 1 µM BIRB 0796 [30]. Although BIRB 0796 is
a potent inhibitor of JNK2 in vitro , it does not affect the phos-
phorylation of JNK substrates (c-Jun and ATF2) in cells at the low
(0.1µM) concentration that abolishes p38 αMAPK activity in
cells, because JNK1 is the dominant isoform that phosphorylatesc-Jun and activates the AP1 transcription factor in the cells that
have been studied so far [31,32].
We have used BIRB 0796 extensively to study the role of p38 α
MAPK and p38 βMAPK in cell-based assays and we recommend
that it be used in parallel with SB 203580 or SB 202190 when
assessing the physiological roles of these protein kinases.
Src family kinase inhibitors (SU 6656, PP1, PP2 and Src
inhibitor 1)
The compound SU 6656 is reported to be a potent inhibitor of
Src family members [33]. In the present study we found that it
inhibited AMPK, BRSK2 and MST2 with similar potency to its
inhibition of Src and Lck, and it inhibited Aurora B and C, evenmore potently than Src and Lck in vitro (Tables 1 and 2). SU 6656
also inhibited other protein kinases, such as CaMKK α, CaMKK β,
CHK2 and SRPK1 (Table 1). These ﬁndings indicate that resultsobtained by using SU 6656 should be interpreted with caution.
The related pyrazolopyrimidines PP1 and PP2 have been used
widely to suggest physiological roles for Src family proteinkinases, although they do not discriminate between differentmembers of this family [34,35]. They also inhibit other protein
tyrosine kinases, such as Eph-A2 and FGF-R1 (results not shown).
In our assays, PP1 and PP2 inhibited Src and the closely relatedLck with IC
50values of 50 nM, whereas CSK, p38 αMAPK and
CK1δwere inhibited with 3–10-fold lower potency. Interestingly,Table 2 Potencies of compounds developed as Raf and Src inhibitors

IC50values were determined from assays carried out at ten different inhibitor concentrations.

we found that RIP2 was inhibited even more potently than were
Src or Lck (Tables 1 and 2), and we have recently exploited thisﬁnding to identify novel roles for RIP2 in cells [36].
Another compound, termed Src-I1, was found to be a potent
inhibitor of Src (Table 2), but also inhibited other Src family
members, such as Lck, Csk (Table 1) and Yes (results not shown)with similar potency to Src, and RIP2 with even greater potency
(Table 2). In addition, it inhibited CHK2 with similar potency to
c/circlecopyrtThe Authors Journal compilation c/circlecopyrt2007 Biochemical Society302 J. Bain and others
Src, and Aurora B with slightly lower potency (Table 1). However,
in contrast with PP1 and PP2, it did not inhibit p38 α/p38βMAPKs
or CK1 δ(Table 1). We therefore recommend that PP1 or PP2 be
used in parallel with Src-I1 to assess the physiological roles ofthe Src family of protein tyrosine kinases.
PP1 derivatives NM-PP1 and NA-PP1
A signiﬁcant subset of protein kinases, including Src, Lck,
p38α/p38βMAPKs, GAK, RIP2 and a number of receptor
tyrosine kinases, possess a threonine residue at the so-called‘gatekeeper’ site. This creates a hydrophobic pocket near the ATP-
binding site, which underlies the sensitivity of these enzymes to
compounds such as PP1/PP2 and/or SB 203580. By contrast,these compounds do not inhibit most protein kinases because
they possess a bulky hydrophobic residue at this position. For
example, in v-Src, the virally encoded form of Src, the threonineresidue is replaced by isoleucine, explaining why this oncogene
product is insensitive to PP1/PP2 [35]. However, by mutating the
residue at the gatekeeper site to threonine or other amino acidswith even smaller side chains (serine, alanine or glycine), it ispossible to convert protein kinases into forms that can be potently
inhibited by PP1, PP2 or SB 203580. Conversely, the mutation
of the gatekeeper threonine residue into an amino acid with alarger side chain converts these protein kinases into SB203580-
insensitive forms [37–39].
Recently, ‘knock-in’ mice have been generated that express
a mutated form of JNK in which the gatekeeper methionine
residue has been changed to glycine [31,32]. In contrast with
wild-type JNK, the mutated JNK can be inhibited by modiﬁedPP1 derivatives, such as NA-PP1 and NM-PP1. Potentially, this
is a powerful way of studying the physiological roles of protein
kinases, because the mutated kinase possesses an activity similarto that of the wild-type enzyme, but can be inhibited rapidly andreversibly by adding NA-PP1 or NM-PP1 to the culture medium.
However, the general applicability of this approach depends, in
part, on the selectivity with which NA-PP1 and NM-PP1 inhibitthe mutant protein kinases compared with the other wild-type
protein kinases that are expressed endogenously in the same
cells and tissues. We therefore examined the speciﬁcities of NA-PP1 and NM-PP1 against our extended panel of kinases.
The speciﬁcities of NA-PP1 and NM-PP1 were similar to
those exhibited by PP1 and PP2, these compounds inhibitingRIP2, GAK, CK1 and p38 α/βMAPK, as well as Src, Lck and
Csk (Table 1) and other protein-tyrosine kinases such as Eph-
A2 and FGF-R1 (results not shown). Additionally, we foundthat NA-PP1 and NM-PP1 inhibited PKD1 and MST2, whereasNM-PP1 also inhibits PKA (Tables 1 and 2). We also found that
the concentrations of NA-PP1 and NM-PP1 required to inhibit the
gatekeeper mutants of JNK1 (JNK1[M108A] and JNK1[M108G])were similar to those required to inhibit the Src family kinases
RIP2 and PKD (Table 2). Wild-type JNK1 was not inhibited by
NA-PP1 or NM-PP1 (Table 1).
These ﬁndings suggest that caution may be needed in
interpreting experiments performed using cells and tissues from
mice that express the gatekeeper mutants of protein kinases(sensitized to inhibition by NA-PP1/NM-PP1) instead of the
wild-type enzymes. Although control experiments can be carried
out using cells/tissues from wild-type mice or knock-out micethat do not express the protein kinase, to check for ‘off-target’effects of NA-PP1 and NM-PP1, it is often necessary to inhibit
protein kinases in two different signalling pathways in order to
suppress the phosphorylation of a particular protein or biologicalprocess. For example, the combined inhibition of MKK1 and
p38αMAPK is needed to suppress the phosphorylation of CREB(cAMP-response-element-binding protein) induced by EGF or
UV-C radiation [40,41], whereas the combined inhibition of PI3K
[phosphatidylinositol (phosphoinositide) 3-kinase] and MKK1 isneeded to prevent the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK3[41]. It is therefore possible that the effects of NA-PP1/NM-PP1
on cells do not always result from the inhibition of the gatekeeper
mutant kinase alone, but may result from the combined inhibitionof the mutant kinase and one or more other intracellular protein
kinases, such as Src family members RIP2 and PKD1, which are
inhibited by these compounds at similar concentrations.
Raf inhibitors ZM 336372, BAY 439006 and GW 5074
The Raf isoforms lie at the head of the classical growth-factor-
stimulated MAP kinase cascade that plays a key role in stimulating
cells to proliferate or differentiate. Activating mutations in B-Rafoccur in many cancers and with high frequency in malignant
melanoma. ZM 336372 was originally developed as a c-Raf
inhibitor. Like p38 αMAPK and p38 βMAPK, Raf possesses
a threonine residue at the gatekeeper site, explaining why ZM336372 inhibits p38 α/βMAPKs and why SB 203580 inhibits Raf.
Thus the mutation of Thr
106in p38 αMAPK to methionine makes
it insensitive to both ZM 336372 and SB 203580 [25,42]. Herewe extended the speciﬁcity of ZM 336372 to 70 protein kinases,
which established that it does not inhibit other protein kinases
tested signiﬁcantly, apart from three that possess a threonineresidue at the gatekeeper site (p38 αMAPK, p38 βMAPK and
Lck) (Tables 1 and 2).
Despite being a potent and speciﬁc inhibitor of Raf, ZM 336372
does not prevent the growth-factor- or phorbol-ester-induced
activation of MKK1 or ERK1/ERK2 and, unlike inhibitors of
MKK1, it does not reverse the phenotype of Ras- or Raf-transformed cell lines [42]. This appears to be explained bya feedback control loop in which Raf efﬁciently prevents its
own activation, such that the inhibition of Raf by ZM 336372
is always counterbalanced by an equivalent activation, resultingfrom the suppression of this feedback loop [42]. These ﬁndings
have highlighted a problem in targeting Raf for the development
of anti-cancer drugs.
BAY 439006 was also developed initially as a Raf inhibitor [43]
and, in the present study, we found that its speciﬁcity resembles
that of ZM 336372. Thus, like ZM 336372, BAY 439006 alsoinhibits p38 αMAPK, p38 βMAPK, Src and Lck. However, unlike
ZM 336372, BAY 439006 also inhibits RIP2, Aurora kinases,
HIPK2, HIPK3 and ERK8 (Tables 1 and 2). BAY 439006 (alsocalled Nexavar) has been approved for the treatment of kidneycancer and gastrointestinal tumours that are resistant to Gleevec.
Although originally believed to exert its anticancer effects by
inhibiting Raf, more recent studies have demonstrated that italso inhibits a number of receptor tyrosine kinases that possess
threonine at the gatekeeper site, and that inhibition of these targets,
rather than Raf, is likely to underlie its clinical efﬁcacy [44].Consistent with this, we have found that BAY 439006 inhibits
FGF-R1 and Eph-A2 tyrosine kinases (results not shown).
GW 5074 is another inhibitor of Raf isoforms (Table 2). In
the present study we found that this compound inhibited the three
PIM isoforms more potently than Raf, and it also inhibited several
other protein kinases, such as HIPK2, RIP2, GAK and MST2, witha potency comparable with that towards Raf (Tables 1 and 2).
In summary, the feedback-control mechanism by which Raf
suppresses its own activation means that no compounds have
yet been developed that convincingly prevent the activationof the classical MAPK cascade by inhibiting Raf, and inhibitors of
MKK1 are being used for this purpose instead, as detailed below.

Inhibitors of MKK1 and its activation (U0126, PD 184352, PD
0325901 and PD 0325901-Cl)
MKK1 (also called MEK1) is activated by Raf in vivo and is
also being targeted to develop anticancer drugs. PD 98059 [45]
and U0126 [46] were the ﬁrst compounds to be described that
target MKK1 and the closely related MKK2 and have beenexploited in thousands of subsequent studies. Although initially
identiﬁed by their ability to inhibit a mutated form of MKK1
that possesses some constitutive activity in vitro , PD 98059 and
U0126 are non-competitive inhibitors that appear to interact withthe inactive unphosphorylated kinase more strongly than the active
phosphorylated species and therefore exert their effects in cell-
based assays by preventing the phosphorylation of MKK1 and/orthe conformational transition that generates the activated enzyme
[1,45]. More recently, additional non-competitive inhibitors of
MKK1 with greater potency (PD 184352 [47] and PD 0325901[5]) have been developed and have entered clinical trials as anti-
cancer agents.
The speciﬁcities of U0126, PD 184352, PD 0325901 and the
(S) stereoisomer of a closely related compound, termed here PD
0325901-Cl (Supplementary Figure S1) are compared in Table 3.
PD 184352, PD 0325901 and PD 0325901-Cl inhibited the activephosphorylated form of MKK1 with IC
50values close to 1 µM
in vitro , whereas U0126 inhibited activated MKK1 with about 10-
fold lower potency. However, these non-competitive inhibitors
suppressed the activation of ERK1/ERK2 (the substrates ofMKK1) at much lower concentrations in cell-based assays,
presumably because they bind even more strongly to the inactive
unphosphorylated form of MKK1. We have reported previouslythat the EGF-induced activation of ERK1/ERK2 was completely
suppressed at 10 µM U0126 or 1 µM PD 184352 in Swiss 3T3
cells [1]. In the present study, we found that PD 0325901 and the(S)a n d( R) isomers of PD 0325901-Cl were even more potent
inhibitors than PD 184352. PD 0325901 and the ( S)i s o m e ro fP D
0325901-Cl suppressed the activation of ERK1/ERK2 at 25 nMin EGF-stimulated HeLa cells, as compared with 0.5 µMf o rP D
184352 in parallel experiments. The ( R) isomer of PD 0325901-Cl
was a slightly less potent inhibitor than the ( S) isomer (Figure 1A).
At these concentrations, no other protein kinases in our panelwere inhibited and, even at 10 µM, only a few protein
kinases were inhibited slightly (Table 3).
PD 98059 and U0126 have been reported to inhibit MKK5, a
protein kinase closely related to MKK1, with similar potency to
MKK1 [49]. Thus these compounds also prevent the activation of
ERK5, the physiological substrate of MKK5. We have reportedthat concentrations of PD 184352 which block the activation of
ERK1/ERK2 in cells (1–2 µM) do not affect the activation
of ERK5, and that higher concentrations (10–20 µM) are needed
to prevent the activation of ERK5 in cells [50]. Here we show
that PD 0325901 and PD 0325901-Cl also prevent the activation
of ERK1/ERK2 in cells at concentrations that do not affect theactivation of ERK5, as judged by their failure to preventthe EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK5, measured by a
decrease in electrophoretic mobility. However, these compounds
blocked the activation of ERK5 when included in the culturemedium at concentrations of 2 µM or higher (Figure 1B).
In summary, PD 184352 and PD 0325901/PD 0325901-Cl are
both extremely potent and selective inhibitors of MKK1 (and theclosely related MKK2) in cell-based assays and can also be used
to suppress the activation of ERK5. Physiological substrates for
ERK5 can be identiﬁed as proteins whose phosphorylation in cellsis unaffected by 0.1 µM PD 0325901, but prevented by 2 µMP D
0325901, or as proteins whose phosphorylation is unaffected by
1–2µM PD 184352, but suppressed 10-20 µM PD 184352. Werecommend that PD 184352 or PD 0325901 be used to inhibit
MKK1 in cells. The structurally unrelated U0126 can be used to
check the results.
RSK inhibitors BI-D1870, SL0101 and FMK
The RSK isoforms are activated by ERK1/ERK2 and are themost downstream kinases of the classical MAPK cascade.
We have recently described BI-D1870 as a relatively speciﬁcnanomolar inhibitor of RSK isoforms and exploited it to identify
physiological substrates and roles for RSK in cells [51]. BI-D1870
was originally developed in a programme to identify inhibitors ofPLKs, and it also inhibits PLK1 with slightly lower potency than
RSK isoforms, whereas Aurora B, MELK, PIM3 and MST2,
were inhibited with 10–100-fold lower potency and other proteinkinases tested were unaffected [51] (Table 3).
In the present study we compared BI-D1870 with SL0101 [52]
and FMK [53], two other recently described inhibitors of RSK
(Table 3). These experiments revealed that SL0101 was also arelatively speciﬁc inhibitor of RSK isoforms, but much less potent
than BI-D1870 (Table 1). SL0101 inhibited Aurora B, PIM1 and
PIM3 with slightly lower potency than RSK1/RSK2, but otherprotein kinases in the panel were unaffected, including PLK1.
RSK isoforms are unusual in possessing two protein kinase
domains in the same polypeptide. ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylateand activate the C-terminal kinase domain, which then activates
the N-terminal kinase domain, enabling the N-terminal kinase
domain to phosphorylate other proteins. FMK is an irreversibleinhibitor that covalently modiﬁes the C-terminal kinase domainof RSK. It therefore prevents the activation of the N-terminal
kinase domain of RSK by the C-terminal kinase domain, but
does not affect the activity of the N-terminal domain, explainingwhy the active forms of RSK1 and RSK2 are not inhibited by
FMK in vitro (Table 3 and [53]). This contrasts with BI-D1870
and SL0101, which inhibit the N-terminal kinase domain. In thepresent study we found that FMK inhibited relatively few protein
kinases in the panel, although it did inhibit protein tyro-
sine kinases, such as Src, Lck, Yes and Eph-A2, as well as S6K1(Tables 3 and 5).
In summary, we [51] and others [54] have found D1870 to be a
useful inhibitor of RSK isoforms in cells and recommend it for thispurpose, although it should be born in mind that PLKs will alsobe inhibited. SL0101 [52] (C. Watts, personal communication)
and FMK [55] are also useful. FMK is the only known inhibitor
of the C-terminal kinase domain of RSK and may therefore havea further use in preventing the phosphorylation of any proteins,
besides the N-terminal kinase domain of RSK, that might be
targeted by the C-terminal domain in cells. However, FMK wouldnot inhibit RSK if the N-terminal kinase domain were activated
by a mechanism that was independent of the C-terminal domain,
as has recently been observed [54,55].
Inhibitors of GSK3 (CT 99021, AR-A0-144-18, SB 216763, SB
415286, alsterpaullone, kenpaullone and LiCl)
Inhibitors of GSK3 are being developed as potential drugs to
treat diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer’s and other diseases [56]. The
compounds alsterpaullone, kenpaullone [2], CT 99021, AR-
A0144-18, SB 216763 and SB 415286 [57] inhibit GSK3 atnanomolar concentrations. In the present study we found thatCT 99021 was the most potent and speciﬁc inhibitor in vitro .
It inhibited CDK2–cyclin A about 50-fold less potently and
did not affect other protein kinases in the panel signiﬁcantly at1µM (Tables 2 and 3). Apart from AR-A014418, the other four
GSK3 inhibitors inhibited several other protein kinases in addition

Figure 1 Effect of MKK1/MKK5 inhibitors on the activation of ERK1/ERK2

HeLa cells were serum-starved for 16 h and incubated for a further 1 h in the presence ( +)o r
absence ( −) of PD184352, PD 0325901-Cl [( R) steroisomer], PD 0325901 [( S) steroisomer]
or PD 0325901 at the concentrations indicated. The cells were then stimulated for 10 min
with 100 ng/ml EGF, lysed, and 30 µg of the extract protein was denatured in SDS, subjected
to SDS/PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with an antibodyrecognizing phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 in ( A) and immunoblotted with an antibody that
recognizes all forms of ERK5 equally well in ( B).
to CDK2–cyclin A. For example, SB 216763 inhibited ERK8,
DYRK1A, PIM3, SRPK1 and HIPK2, SB 415286 inhibited
MKK1, ERK8 and MST2 and several other protein kinases to aslightly lesser extent, kenpaullone inhibited PHK, CHK2, PAK4,PAK5, PIM3, Src and Lck, whereas alsterpaullone inhibited PHK
and CHK2 (Table 3). SB 216763, SB 415286, kenpaullone and
alsterpaullone also inhibited other protein kinases less strongly.
Lithium ions inhibit GSK3 in the millimolar range, and
its effects in cell-based assays have been used to suggest
physiological roles for this enzyme. In the present study we foundthat LiCl inhibited GSK3 βactivity in vitro more strongly than
any of the other protein kinases tested. However, LiCl inhibited
a number of other protein kinases with slightly lower potencythan GSK3, including, MNK1, MNK2, smMLCK, PHK, CHK2,
HIPK3, IKK εand TBK1 (Table 3).
In summary, we recommend using CT 99021 to inhibit GSK3
in cells, as it is the most potent and speciﬁc inhibitor available.When added to the cell culture medium at 1–2 µM, it completely
prevents the phosphorylation of authentic GSK3 substrates such
as NDRG1 (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1) [57] and c-Junat Thr
239(S. Morton and P. Cohen, unpublished work). Results
obtained with CT 99021 can be checked by using one or more of
the other GSK3 inhibitors.
Inhibitors of the PI3K superfamily (wortmannin, LY 294002, PI 103
and rapamycin)
Many cancers are caused by activating mutations in PI3K α
or inhibitory mutations in PTEN (phosphatase and tensin
homologue deleted on chromosome 10), the phosphatase thatreconverts PtdIns(3,4,5) P3(the product of the PI3K reaction) into
PtdIns(4,5) P2. For this reason, the development of potent and
speciﬁc inhibitors of Class 1 PI3Ks has recently become of great
interest for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs.
The fungal metabolite wortmannin was originally known as
a potent inhibitor of the neutrophil respiratory burst and was
shown subsequently to inhibit smMLCK [58]. However, it laterbecame clear that it was a far more potent inhibitor of Class 1 and
Class 2 PI3Ks than of MLCK, and it completely suppresses their
activities when added to the cell culture medium at only 50–100 nM. More recently, wortmannin was also found to inhibit
PLK1 [59]. We therefore re-examined its speciﬁcity against
our extended panel. These studies conﬁrmed that wortmannininhibited smMLCK and PLK1 in our assays in the micromolarrange (Tables 4 and 5), but no other protein kinases in the
panel were inhibited signiﬁcantly. At micromolar concentrations,
wortmannin is also reported to inhibit a PI4K and mTOR(mammalian target of rapamycin), another member of the PI 3K
superfamily.
LY 294002 is another commonly used, but less potent, inhibitor
of PI3Ks, which inhibits Class 1 PI3Ks at 10–50 µM in cell-based
assays. It has been the inhibitor of choice when cells are incubated
for prolonged periods, because wortmannin is unstable in aqueoussolution. However, LY 294002 is also reported to inhibit other
kinases, such as TORC1, CK2 [1] and PLK1 [59] at concentrations
similar to those that inhibit PI3Ks [1]. Using our extended panel,we now ﬁnd that LY 294002 also inhibits PIM1, PIM3, HIPK2and GSK3 (Tables 2 and 4), again at concentrations similar to
those that inhibit Class 1 PI3Ks. Immobilized LY 294002 was
recently shown to bind GSK3 and a number of other ATP-bindingproteins that are not protein kinases [60].
In cell-based assays PI-103 [61] blocks Class 1 PI3Ks
completely at only 0.5 µM, as judged by suppression of the IGF-
1-stimulated activation of PKB in HEK-293 cells (Figure 2A).
However, it inhibited relatively few of the 70 protein kinases in our
panel and then by no more than 30–40 %,e v e nw h e na s s a y e d in
vitro at 1µM and at low ATP concentrations (Table 4). Moreover,
PI 103 at this concentration did not affect two other members of the
PI3K superfamily, the protein kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasiamutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), as judged by itsfailure to suppress the phosphorylation (activation) of their
substrates, the protein kinases CHK1 and CHK2, in cell-based
assays (Figure 2B). However, in another recent study, PI 103 wasshown to inhibit TORC1 with similar potency to Class 1 PI3Ks
[62].
Rapamycin is a naturally occurring compound produced
by the soil bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus ,w h i c h
originates from Easter Island (Rapa Nui is the native name for
Easter Island). It was ﬁrst puriﬁed over 35 years ago as anantifungal agent, but was originally discarded because of its
undesirable immunosuppressive side effects. Its potential an as
immunosuppressive drug was only explored many years later,and it was ﬁnally approved as an immunosuppressant in 1999.It is used most frequently to prevent tissue rejection after kidney
and pancreatic islet transplantation. The anticancer properties of
rapamycin were also noticed in the mid-1970s, and a modiﬁedform of rapamycin has recently been approved for clinical use.
Rapamycin exerts its effects on cells by binding to FKBP (FK506
binding protein), and the molecular target for the rapamycin–FKBP complex was identiﬁed as TORC1 [63]. The unusual
mechanism of action of rapamycin may explain why it does not
inhibit any protein kinase in our extended panel (Table 4) or anyother protein kinase that has been tested, even at a concentration
of 1µM, which is 10–20-fold higher than that required to inhibit
TORC1 activity completely in cell-based assays.

Figure 2 Effect of PI 103 on the activities of PI3K superfamily members in
HEK-293 cells
(A) HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney-293) cells were incubated for 1 h with ( +) or without
(−)0 . 5µM PI 103, then stimulated for 30 min with IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) and lysed. Cell extracts
(60µg of protein) were denatured in SDS, subjected to SDS/PAGE and, after transfer to
PVDF membranes, immunoblotted with a phosphospeciﬁc antibody that recognizes PKB
phosphorylated at Ser473[pPKB (S473)]. ( B) HEK-293 cells were incubated for 1 h with ( +)o r
without ( −)0 . 5µM PI 103, then treated for 2 h with the DNA-alkylating agent MMS (2 mM)
and lysed. Cell extracts (60 µg of protein) were denatured in SDS, subjected to SDS/PAGE
and, after transfer to PVDF membranes, immunoblotted with phosphospeciﬁc antibodies that
recognize CHK1 phosphorylated at Ser345[pChk1 (S345)]and CHK2 phosphorylated at Thr68
[pChk2 (T68)].
In summary, while wortmannin continues to be very useful as
an inhibitor of PI3Ks in cell-based assays, we recommend that the
use of LY 294002 be discontinued and that it be replaced by PI-103. Rapamycin is an exquisitely speciﬁc inhibitor of TORC1 and
should be used in parallel to check whether any of the observed
effects of PI-103 result from the inhibition of TORC1, rather thanPI3Ks.
PDK1 inhibitors BX 795 and BX 320
PDK1 catalyses the activation of PKB isoforms, a reaction thatrequires the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5) P
3, the product of the PI3K-
catalysed reaction. Mice expressing 15 %of the normal level of
PDK1 are strikingly protected against the formation of multiple
tumours that occur in animals carrying only one copy of thePTEN gene [64]. For this reason, PDK1 has become an attractivetarget for an anticancer drug [65]. BX 795 and BX 320 have been
described as potent and speciﬁc inhibitors of PDK1 [66] and are
beginning to be used to block its activity in cells. In the presentstudy we found that BX 795 was not only a potent inhibitor of
PDK1, but also inhibited ERK8, MNK2, Aurora B, Aurora C,
MARK3 and IKK εwith similar potency. TBK1 was inhibited
even more potently than PDK1 (Table 4). The IC
50values for
inhibition of these protein kinases in our assays were: PDK1
(17 nM), Aurora B (11 nM), IKK ε(9.5 nM) and TBK1 (2.3 nM).
The speciﬁcity of BX 320 was similar to BX 795, although it was
a much less potent inhibitor.
Interestingly, Aurora kinase (see below) and TBK1 [67,68], like
PDK1, are also attractive targets for the development of anticancerdrugs. TBK1 is activated in response to hypoxia [67] and controls
the production of angiogenic factors such as VEGF (vascular
endothelial growth factor) and IL-8 (interleukin-8). Moreover, itslevels are elevated in malignant colon and breast-cancer cells.
TBK1 is also reported to be activated by the RalB–Sec5 effector
c/circlecopyrtThe Authors Journal compilation c/circlecopyrt2007 Biochemical Society308 J. Bain and others
complex, restricting the initiation of apoptotic programmes and so
aiding tumour-cell survival [68]. BX 795 and other compounds
that are potent inhibitors of these three protein kinases mighttherefore be particularly effective as anticancer agents.
The present study indicates that BX 320 and BX 795 are not
speciﬁc inhibitors of PDK1, but might be useful for assessing the
physiological roles of TBK1 and the closely related IKK ε,a st h e y
are the most potent inhibitors of these two protein kinases to be
described thus far.
PKB inhibitors A-443654 and Akt-I-1,2
PKB (also called Akt), a protein kinase that is activated by PDK1
in vivo , has also attracted considerable interest as an anticancer
target. A-443654 has been described as a speciﬁc inhibitor of
PKB [69] and is being used to ascribe particular functions to
this protein kinase. In the present study we conﬁrmed that thiscompound was indeed a very potent inhibitor of PKB, but found
that it also inhibits some other members of the AGC subfamily
of protein kinases (comprising PKA, PKG and PKC, but alsoincluding PKB/Akt, S6K1, RSK1 and PDK1) with slightly lower
potency, such as PKA, PRK2 and MSK1, and it also inhibited
DYRK1A. Several other protein kinases were inhibited to a lesserextent (Table 4). These analyses show that A-443654 is not aselective PKB inhibitor and should be used with considerable
caution.
In contrast with A-443654, Akt-I-1,2 is a highly selective non-
competitive inhibitor of PKB in vitro [70]. At a concentration of
1µM, it inhibits full-length PKB α/ A K T 1o rC a M K 1b y8 0 %,
but no other protein kinase in the panel, including the catalyticdomains of PKB αand PKB β, was inhibited signiﬁcantly at
this concentration (Table 4). This is because inhibition by Akt-
I-1,2 requires the presence of the PH (pleckstrin homology)domain. Importantly, Akt-1-I/2 prevents the conformational
change, triggered by the binding of PtdIns(3,4,5) P
3to the PH
domains of PKB isoforms, that allows PDK1 and TORC2 tophosphorylate and activate PKB. For this reason, Akt-I-1,2 isa potent inhibitor of the activation of PKB rather than of the
active PKB itself, and prevents the insulin-induced activation of
PKB/Akt when added to cells at 1 µM [71].
In summary, we recommend the use of Akt-I-1,2 to inhibit PKB
activation in cells.
Inhibitors of CK1 (D4476, CK1-7 and IC 261)
CK1 isoforms play multiple roles in cell regulation. We have
previously reported that the compound D4476 synthesized duringa programme to develop inhibitors of ALK5 (activin-receptor-like
kinase 5) was a relatively selective inhibitor of CK1 and more
potent than the other known CK1 inhibitors CK1-7 and IC261against 30 protein kinases [72]. Here we extended these studies to
the larger panel (Tables 5 and 6). The results conﬁrmed that D4476
is a rather selective inhibitor of CK1. D4476 inhibited CK1 δ20–
30-fold more potently than PKD1 or p38 αMAPK, and no other
protein kinases in the panel were inhibited to a signiﬁcant extent.
CK1-7 and IC261 were 5–10-fold less potent inhibitors of CK1
and also inhibited several other protein kinases, including PIM1and PIM3 (CK1-7 and IC261), ERK8, MNK1, AMPK, SGK1
(CK1-7) (Table 6). We recommend the use of D4476 to inhibit
CK1 isoforms in cell-based assays. A method for preventing itsprecipitation in aqueous solution has been described [72].
Identiﬁcation of harmine as a speciﬁc inhibitor of DYRK isoforms
Healers in the Amazon region have been using harmine as a
psychoactive compound in a brew known as ‘ayahuasca’ forthousands of years. A serotonin antagonist and reversible short-
term inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, it was ﬁrst used to treat
Parkinsonism in 1928, where it was said to brighten the mentalstatus of the patients. However, it is also of interest as an anti-cancer agent and, in this connection, was reported to inhibit CDKs
in the micromolar range [73]. These ﬁndings led us to examine
its speciﬁcity against our panel of protein kinases, which revealedthat harmine was an extremely potent and speciﬁc inhibitor of the
DYRK family of protein kinases (Table 6). It inhibited DYRK1A
in the nanomolar range, the DYRK2 and DYRK3 isoforms beinginhibited about 10-fold less potently. In our experiments, harmine
did not inhibit CDK2 signiﬁcantly, but did inhibit the three PIM
isoforms and CK1 in the micromolar range (Tables 5 and 6).
Down’s syndrome, resulting from the presence of an extra
copy of chromosome 21, is the most common genetic disorder
in humans, with a frequency of 1 in 800 live births. The Down’s-syndrome child begins life with an IQ close to that of a normalchild, but these parameters gradually deteriorate until, at age 13,
they display an average IQ of 50. Interestingly, the gene encoding
DYRK1A is located within the Down’s syndrome criticalregion of chromosome 21. DYRK1A is expressed at elevated
levels in human Down’s-syndrome foetal tissues, and mice that
overexpress this kinase have defects in neural development [74].A recent report suggested that the pathological effects of high
DYRK1A activity may result from the hyperphosphorylation and
reduced activity of the transcription factor NFATc (nuclear factorof activated T-cells) [75]. The ﬁnding that harmine is a potent and
speciﬁc inhibitor of DYRK1A raises the possibility of preventing
mental retardation in Down’s-syndrome patients through the useof drugs, such as harmine or a derivative of this compound, thatinhibit this protein kinase.
Very recently, harmine was identiﬁed as an anti-diabetic,
cell-type-speciﬁc regulator of PPAR γ(peroxisome-proliferator-
activated receptor γ) expression and, when administered to
diabetic mice, it mimicked the effect of PPAR γligands on
adipocyte gene expression and sensitivity to insulin [76]. It willclearly be of great interest to ﬁnd out whether the anti-diabetic
effects of harmine are explained by its ability to inhibit one or
more DYRK isoforms.
The potent inhibition of DYRK1A by harmine was unexpected,
given its rather low molecular mass (212 Da), and understanding
how this drug interacts with DYRK1A will be of considerableinterest. The related compounds, harmalol, harmaline and
harmane were also relatively speciﬁc, but much weaker, inhibitors
of DYRK isoforms (Table 6). However, currently there is noinformation at to whether harmine can suppress the activity ofDYRK1A in cells.
CDK inhibitors roscovitine and purvalanol A
The olomoucine derivatives roscovitine [77] and purvalanol [78]were identiﬁed as CDK inhibitors a number of years ago.Purvalanol was found to inhibit several protein kinases in our
panel, such as PAK4, PAK5, MELK, Src (Tables 5 and 7) and
Yes (results not shown), although not as potently as CDK2.Roscovitine inhibited ERK8, but was only a weak inhibitor of
other protein kinases (Tables 5 and 7). Roscovitine and purvalanol
are known to inhibit other CDKs with similar potency to CDK2,including CDK1, CDK5 and CDK7 [77,78], whereas roscovitine
also inhibits pyridoxal kinase [79]. These ﬁndings support the
continued use of these two compounds as pan-CDK inhibitors.
Aurora kinase inhibitors VX 680 and SU6668
VX 680 was developed as a potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases,
which regulate several aspects of the cell division cycle, including

Table 7 Speciﬁcities of compounds developed as inhibitors of CDK, Aurora kinases, CaMKK, AMPK, IKK, JNK and MNK
The concentrations of compounds used in the assays are indicated below each molecule and the results are presented as the percentage activity remaini ng in the presence of inhibitors as compared
with control incubations with inhibitor omitted (averages of duplicate determinations). Each experiment was repeated two or three times with simil ar results. Further details of the assays are given in
the Materials and methods section. Important values are highlighted in boldface type. ND, not determined.

microtubule–kinetochore attachments. For this reason Aurora
kinases are being targeted for the development of anti-cancer
drugs, and some have entered clinical trials. More recently, VX680 was also found to be a potent inhibitor of the Abl (Abelson)protein tyrosine kinase [80]. We found that VX 680 also inhibited
MELK, Src and other protein kinases, such as FGF-R1 and Eph-
A2 (results not shown), with less marked inhibition of severalother protein kinases such as ERK8, RSK1, RSK2, PAK4 and
MST2 (Tables 5 and 7). VX 680 has also been reported to inhibit
the protein tyrosine kinase FLT3 (ﬁbromyalgia syndrome-relatedtyrosine kinase 3), although not as potently as Aurora kinases [81].
VX 680 appears to inactivate Aurora A and Aurora B completely
when added to the cell culture medium at 1 µM, as judged by the
blockade of TACC3 (transforming acidic coiled coil protein 3; an
Aurora A substrate) and histone H3 (an Aurora B substrate) [64].
SU 6668 was developed to inhibit the VEGF receptor and
FGFR with the aim of inhibiting tumour growth by suppressingangiogenesis, but it has recently been found to bind to and inhibit
several other protein kinases, including Aurora kinases, TBK1
and AMPK [82]. When proﬁled against our extended panel, wefound that SU 6668 inhibited not only these protein kinases, but
a number of others. MKK1, CHK2, ERK8, RSK1, RSK2, S6K1,
Aurora B and Aurora C were the protein kinases inhibited mostpotently (Tables 5 and 7). These ﬁndings indicate that SU 6668 is
insufﬁciently speciﬁc to be useful as a protein kinase inhibitor in
cell-based assays.
CaMKK inhibitor STO 609
STO 609 has been identiﬁed as an inhibitor of CaMKK α
and CaMKK β, which are ‘upstream’ activators of CaMK 1 and
4. CaMKK βalso activates AMPK in neuronal cells [83] and T-
cells [84]. When tested against our extended panel, CaMKK βwas
inhibited about 10-fold more potently than CaMKK α.H o w e v e r ,
STO 609 was also inhibited ERK8, MNK1, CK2, AMPK, PIM2,PIM3, DYRK2, DYRK3 and HIPK2 with similar potency to
CaMKK α(Tables 5 and 7). STO 609 suppresses CaMKK activity
almost completely when added to cells at 25 µM (D. G. Hardie,
personal communication). However, although this compound has
been used to implicate CaMKKs in the activation of AMPK, the
present study indicates that STO 609 is not a speciﬁc inhibitor andresults obtained by using it should be interpreted with caution.
An inhibitor of AMPK (Compound C)
This compound has been described as an inhibitor of AMPK and isbeing used increasingly to inhibit this protein kinase in cell-basedassays. In the present study we found that Compound C inhibited
AMPK with an IC
50value of 0.1–0.2 µM, but a number of other
protein kinases were inhibited with similar or greater potency,including ERK8, MNK1, PHK, MELK, DYRK isoforms, HIPK2,
Src, Lck (Table 7) and Yes, FGF-R1 and Eph-A2 (results not
shown). Since a concentration of 40 µM in the culture medium
is needed to inhibit AMPK completely in cells (D. G. Hardie,
personal communication), the use of this compound to identify
potential functions of AMPK is not recommended.
Inhibitors of IKK β(PS1145, BMS 345541 and SC 514)
These compounds have been described and used as inhibitors of
the IKKs in many studies. PS 1145 inhibited IKK βwith an IC 50
value of 0.25 µM (Table 5). It also inhibited PIM1 and PIM3 with
similar potency to IKK βand several other protein kinases
with lower potency, but did not inhibit the other three members of
the IKK subfamily (IKK α, IKKεor TBK1) signiﬁcantly (Table 7).
BMS 345541 and SC 514 inhibited IKK βabout 10-fold more
weakly than PS 1145 and also did not inhibit IKK α, IKKεandTBK1 (Tables 5 and 7). BMS 345541 inhibited several other
kinases with slightly lower potency than IKK β, including ERK8,
PKD1, CDK2 and CK1, whereas SC514 inhibited PIM3, PIM1,
DYRK1A, DYRK3 and Aurora B similarly to IKK β(Table 7).
When added to the cell culture medium at 50 µM, PS 1145
was reported to suppress the LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced
phosphorylation and activation of the protein kinase Cot/Tpl2(cancer Osaka thyroid/tumour progression locus-2) at Thr
290
[85], leading to the conclusion that the phosphorylation ofthis residue was catalysed by IKK β.H o w e v e r ,a tal o w e r
concentration (15 µM), no suppression of IL-1 (interleukin 1)-
induced phosphorylation of Thr
290was observed, even though
IKKβwas still blocked completely, as shown by suppression
of the degradation of I κBα(inhibitor of nuclear factor κB). This
suggested that Thr290is phosphorylated by a protein kinase distinct
from IKK β[86], the blockade of Thr290phosphorylation observed
at a higher (50 µM) PS 1145 concentration, presumably resulting
from the ‘non-speciﬁc’ inhibition of another protein kinase.
These ﬁndings suggest that results obtained by using PS 1145
should be interpreted with caution and that the development ofmore speciﬁc inhibitors of IKK isoforms would be extremely
useful.
JNK inhibitors SP 600125 and AS 601245
We have reported previously that SP 600125 is not a speciﬁc
inhibitor of JNK, since it inhibited 13 of the 30 protein kinases
tested with similar or greater potency than JNK isoforms [2].
However, despite the availability of this information, manylaboratories have continued to use SP 600125 as a JNK inhibitor.
Further analysis against our extended panel conﬁrmed the lack
of speciﬁcity of this compound and identiﬁed a number of otherprotein kinases that are inhibited by SP 600125. Those inhibited
as potently or more potently than JNK isoforms, include PKD1,
CHK2, Aurora B and C, MELK, CK1, DYRK2, DYRK3 andHIPK3 (Table 7).
AS 601245 has also been reported as a JNK inhibitor displaying
10–20-fold selectivity over Src, c-Raf, CDK2–cyclin A and
p38αMAPK, with little inhibition of 20 other protein kinases
tested. The compound was also reported to inhibit the LPS-
induced production of TNF α(tumour necrosis factor α) in mice,
to show efﬁcacy in a model of collagen-induced rheumatoidarthritis and to promote cell survival after cerebral ischaemia [87].
However, when proﬁled against our panel, AS 601245 was not
selective for JNK and inhibited many protein kinases, includingp38δMAPK, ERK8, SGK1, GSK3 β, CK2, DYRK1a and PIM
isoforms. More detailed kinetic analysis revealed that AS 601245
was an exceptionally potent inhibitor of PIM1, PIM3 and GSK3,with IC
50values in the nanomolar range that were 50–100-fold
lower than the IC 50values for JNK1 and JNK2 (Tables 5 and 7).
We recommend that the use of SP 600125 and AS 601245
as JNK inhibitors in cell-based assays be discontinued. Thedevelopment of a potent and speciﬁc inhibitor that can suppress
the activities of JNK isoforms in cells would be very useful.
MNK inhibitor CGP 57380
CGP 57380 has been described as an MNK inhibitor [88] andused in cell-based assays for this purpose in several studies.
We found that this compound was a relatively weak inhibitorof MNKs, with IC
50values in the low-micromolar range. Against
our extended panel, several protein kinases were inhibited with
similar potency, including MKK1, CK1 and BRSK2 (Tables 5
and 7). These studies indicate that CGP 57380 is not a speciﬁcinhibitor of MNK isoforms and results obtained from its use in
cell-based assays are difﬁcult to interpret.

Speciﬁcities of some bis(indolyl)maleimides (LY 333531, UCN01,
Ro 318220, Go 6976 and KT 5720)
We have previously examined the speciﬁcities of a number
of bisindolylmaleimides against a smaller panel of proteinkinases and found them to inhibit many protein kinases of the
AGC subfamily, such as S6K1, RSK2, MSK1 and PKC α[1].
However, at least two of these compounds, UCN01 and LY333531, have entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer
and diabetic retinopathy respectively, and indeed clinical trials
of LY 333531 were only discontinued during Phase III. Wetherefore studied a few of these compounds against our extended
panel (Supplementary Table S2). These studies revealed that
LY 333531 was an extremely potent inhibitor of PIM1/PIM3and RSK1/RSK2, as well as PKC α, and that several other
protein kinases were also strongly inhibited, such as PDK1
(see Supplementary Table S2 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/408/bj408ppppadd.htm; for convenience the kinase abbreviationsin the footnote are repeated as Supplementary Table S1). UCN01
was an extremely powerful inhibitor of RSK1/RSK2, PRK2,
CaMKK β, PHK, AMPK, MARK3, CHK1, PIM3, MST2 and
PDK1, as well as PKC α, while both Ro 318220 and Go 6976
were potent inhibitors of RSK1, RSK2, PRK2, PKC α, PKD1,
MSK1, GSK3 β, CDK2-cyclin A and PIM3, as well as PKC α.
Go 6976 potently inhibited many protein kinases, such as RSK1,
CaMKK β, PHK, CHK1, Aurora B, MST2, and PAKs 4, 5 and 6
(Supplementary Table S2).
KT 5720, which was originally described as an inhibitor of
PKA, also inhibited many protein kinases. MKK1, PDK1, PHK,
Aurora B and PIM3 were among the protein kinases inhibitedmost strongly by this compound (Table S2).
In summary, none of the bis(indoyl)maleimides that we have
tested are sufﬁciently speciﬁc to be useful as protein kinaseinhibitors in cell-based assays.
Protein kinase inhibitor Rottlerin
Rottlerin is a compound extracted from the Monkey-face tree(Mallotus philippinensis Muell.), which grows in the tropical
regions of India and has been used for a variety of medicinal
purposes over the generations. Although this compound was
originally reported to inhibit PKC isoforms, especially PKC δ
[89], and has been used as such in many studies, we failed
to observe any inhibition of PKC αor PKC δin a previous
study and instead found that MAPKAP-K2 and PRAK wereinhibited by this compound [1]. When rottlerin was examinedagainst our extended panel, many more protein kinases were
found to inhibited (Supplementary Table S2), those suppressed
most strongly being CHK2, PLK1, PIM3 and SRPK1. Theseobservations indicate that rottlerin is too weak and non-speciﬁc
an inhibitor to be useful in cell-based studies.
Inhibitors of ROCK (H7, H8, HA1077, H89, H1152, Y27632)
Isoquinaline sulphonamide derivatives, such as H7 and H8,developed by Hiroyoshi Hidaka and his colleagues, were among
the ﬁrst inhibitors of protein kinases to be described [90], and thespeciﬁcities of six of these compounds is shown in Supplementary
Table S2. Of these, H89 is marketed as a relatively selective
inhibitor of PKA, whereas HA 1077 has been reported to inhibitthe Rho-dependent protein kinases PRK1 [91] and ROCK [92],and Y27632 to inhibit ROCK1 and ROCK2 [93]. HA 1077 (also
called Fasudil) has been approved in Japan for the treatment of
cerebral vasospasm [94], whereas Y27632 has been reported tonormalize blood pressure in rodent models of hypertension [93],
perhaps by preventing ROCK from inhibiting the major myosinphosphatase in smooth muscle [95]. Y27632 also inhibits RhoA-
mediated cell transformation [96], tumour-cell invasion [97] and
neutrophil chemotaxis [92], suggesting that inhibitors of ROCK
may have therapeutic value as anticancer and anti-inﬂammatoryagents.
We have previously examined the speciﬁcities of H89, HA1077
and Y27632 against a panel of 24 protein kinases [1] and hereextend the analysis to 70 kinases. H7, H8, H89, HA1077 and
H1152 inhibited not only ROCK2 and PRK2, but also other
members of the AGC subfamily of protein kinases, such as RSK1,RSK2, PKA and MSK1 with similar or slightly lower potency than
ROCK2 and PRK2. The compounds H7, H89 and HA1077 also
inhibited AMPK and PKD1, whereas H89 also inhibited PKBisoforms and S6K1, and H-1152 inhibited PHK, Aurora B andAurora C (Supplementary Table S2). H89 has also been reported
to inhibit voltage-dependent potassium ion currents directly by
blocking the pore cavity, an effect that was unrelated to theinhibition of PKA [98].
In summary, results obtained by the use of isoquinaline
sulphonamides should be interpreted with caution.
Concluding remarks
In the present study we have examined the speciﬁcities of manyprotein kinase inhibitors against a panel of 70–80 protein kinases.
The results obtained have re-emphasized the need for great caution
in using small-molecule inhibitors of protein kinases to assess thephysiological roles of these enzymes. Despite being used widely,
many of the compounds analysed in the present study were found
to be too non-speciﬁc for useful conclusions to be made, otherthan to exclude the involvement of particular protein kinases in
cellular processes. However, extrapolating data obtained from
assays performed in vitro to make recommendations about
the usefulness of these compounds as inhibitors of particularprotein kinases in cells is not straightforward and depends on
many factors, such as the stability and cell permeability of the
compound, whether it accumulates in the plasma membrane oran intracellular organelle where a particular target is located,
the concentration of the protein kinase in vivo and whether the
compound is ATP-competitive. The great majority of proteinkinase inhibitors that have been developed bind at or near the ATP
binding site (PD 184352, PD 0325901, Akt-I-1,2 and rapamycin
are exceptions) and, if they were purely ATP-competitive, mightbe expected to be far less potent in cells where ATP concentrations
are in the millimolar range, 100-fold higher than those for assays
in vitro . However, this is not always the case, because the
speciﬁcities of compounds frequently stem from their ability tobind not just in the ATP-binding pocket, but also in neighbouring
hydrophobic pockets. Such interactions can induce fast or slow
conformational changes and can lock the protein kinase into aninactive state [29,99]. Moreover, some compounds may bind more
strongly to the inactive than the active conformation and, like
the MKK1 inhibitor PD 98059 [45], prevent the protein kinasefrom being activated. In these situations the concentration of a
compound needed to suppress activity in cells may be similar
to, or even lower than, those that inhibit the protein kinase in
vitro . Furthermore, a few compounds (such as Akt-I-1,2) only
inhibit the full-length protein kinase and not the catalytic domain
(the reverse is also theoretically possible). Although catalyticdomains are frequently employed for screening purposes if thefull-length protein is difﬁcult to express, it should be borne in
mind that the use of truncated forms of proteins for screening
or to assess speciﬁcity may sometimes give misleading results.A further caveat in extrapolating the data obtained in vitro to
the cellular context is that only 70–80 protein kinases were used
c/circlecopyrtThe Authors Journal compilation c/circlecopyrt2007 Biochemical SocietySpeciﬁcities of protein kinase inhibitors 313
in the present study. Although this is a substantial number, it
represents less than 20 %of the protein kinases encoded by the
human genome. Therefore some compounds may be less speciﬁcthan the results presented in Tables 1–7 and Supplementary TableS2 would indicate. For this reason, the effects of two structurally
unrelated inhibitors of the same protein kinase should be used on
cells wherever possible. Off-target effects can also be controlledfor by the use of cells that do not express a particular protein kinase
or that express a drug-resistant mutant of the protein kinase [27].
Despite the reservations outlined above, a number of
compounds were identiﬁed that displayed impressive selectivity
for a particular protein kinase.
On the basis of the ﬁndings reported here and the effects of
these compounds on cells that we and our colleagues have studied
previously, we recommend that the following compounds be used
in cells to assess the roles of particular protein kinases:
rFor p38 α/p38βMAPKs use SB 203580 (1–5 µM) and
BIRB 0796 (0.1 µM) in parallel; for substrates of p38 γMAPK,
identify proteins whose phosphorylation is prevented by BIRB
0796 (1.0 µM), but not by SB 203580 (5 µM)rFor PI3K use PI-103 (0.5 µM) and wortmannin (0.1 µM) in
parallelrFor PKB/AKT use Akt-I-1, 2 (1 µM)rFor MKK1 use PD 184352 (2 µM) or PD 0325901 (0.1 µM)rFor TORC1 use rapamycin (100 nM)rFor GSK3 use CT 99021 (2 µM)rFor RSK use BI-D1870 (10 µM) plus either SL0101 [54] or
FMK [53,55]rFor CK1 use D4476 (50–100 µM)rVX 680 (1 µM) may be used to inhibit Aurora kinases in
cells [64], whereas roscovitine and purvalanol should continue tobe useful as pan-CDK inhibitors
rHarmine is a very potent and selective inhibitor of DYRK1A,
but whether it can be used to assess the role of this protein kinasein cells has yet to be assessed.
It should be noted that some of the recommended inhibitors are
not yet available commercially and must be synthesized.
It has been estimated that about 30 %of the research and
development programmes of the pharmaceutical industry arecurrently focused on protein kinases (even higher in the ﬁeld
of cancer), and a huge number of compounds with impressive
selectivity for particular protein kinases have been developed. Theexploitation of these compounds for basic fundamental research
by academic scientists is undoubtedly going to be of immense
value in the future in facilitating our understanding of the roles ofprotein kinases in signal-transduction pathways.
Future updates about the speciﬁcities of protein kinase
inhibitors will appear on the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unitwebsite (http//www.dundee.ac.uk/lifesciences/mrcppu).
