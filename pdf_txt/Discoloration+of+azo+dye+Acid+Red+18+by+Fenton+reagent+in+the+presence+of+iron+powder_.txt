Abstract
The examined H2O2/Fe0 process was found to be very efficient for discoloration of simulated waste -
water containing 100 mg/dm3 commercial azo dye Acid Red 18. The optimal doses of H2O2 and Fe0 were 
60 and 50 mg/dm3, respectively at pH 3 and 15 minutes reaction time. Under the described conditions total 
visual discoloration was achieved. A very important factor was reaction time. Generally, the smaller dose 
of iron powder, the greater reaction time needed for visual discoloration. A strict linear correlation was 
observed between Fe0 amount in the range of 10–600 mg/dm3 and final pH. This suggests that the H2O2/Fe0 
process has undoubted advantages in comparison with the classical Fenton reaction, because using exces -
sive amounts of the iron powder could reach higher final pH in the H2O2/Fe0 process. Thus, smaller doses 
of base will be required for final neutralization of wastewater. It was also found that the dissolution time of 
iron powder at acidic conditions (before H2O2 was added) is an important parameter that influences the rate 
of discoloration. As the time of iron powder dissolution increases, the time needed for visual discoloration 
decreases.

The Fenton reaction [1, 2] is a catalytic process for the 
generation of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide 
and is based on an electron transfer between H2O2 and 
iron ions acting as homogeneous catalyst. These radicals 
are a very strong oxidizing agent capable of reacting with 
a wide variety of organic compounds under ambient con -
ditions. The advantage of the Fenton reagent is that no 
energy input is necessary to activate hydrogen peroxide 
[2]. Therefore, this method offers a cost-effective source 
of hydroxyl radicals, using easy-to-handle reagents. The 
Fenton reagent has been found to be effective in treating 
various industrial wastewater components including aro -matic amines [3], a wide variety of dyes [4, 5], and many 
other substances, e.g. pesticides [6, 7] and surfactants [8, 
9]. Therefore, the Fenton reagent has been applied to treat 
a variety of wastes such as those associated with the tex -
tile and chemical industries.
Azo dyes constitute the largest class of dyes used in 
industry [5]. More than two thousand azo dyes are known 
and over half of the commercial dyestuffs are azo dyes. 
Azo dyes are broadly used in the textile industry, and 
also widely employed to color solvents, inks, paints, var -
nishes, paper, plastic, rubber, foods, drugs, and cosmetics 
[10]. Azo dyes are resistant to aerobic biodegradation, 
since the conventional treatment (e.g. activated sludge) 
of wastewater contaminated with these dyes could not 
remove most azo dyes effectively [5, 11].  The resulting 
dye effluent may contain some components or moieties Barbusiński K., Majewski J. 152 Discoloration of Azo Dye Acid... 153
that could be toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic to aquatic 
life [12]. Therefore, the degradation of azo dyes under al -
ternative advanced oxidation technologies, as for example 
the Fenton reagent has to be explored.
Beside the classical Fenton’s reaction (H2O2/ferrous 
salt), recent studies have focused especially on investiga -
tion of the Fenton process with alternative iron sources. A 
number of researchers have investigated the application of 
metal oxides and supported metal oxides, especially those 
of iron, as catalytic materials for the oxidation of organic 
compounds in batch and fixed bed continuous flow treat -
ment systems [13, 14]. They generally observed a greatly 
accelerated decomposition of hydrogen peroxide but 
variable amounts of contaminant loss. Watts et al. [15, 16] 
examined the efficiency of iron minerals toward catalyzed 
degradation of chlorobenzenes by hydrogen peroxide and 
noted considerable differences in reactivity with differ -
ent types of iron oxides. The Fenton reactions were also 
observed with an iron-containing zeolite [17]. Valentine 
and Wang [18] examined the Fenton reaction in the pres -
ence of three iron oxides: ferrihydrite, a semicrystalline 
iron oxide and crystalline goethite. The catalytic activity 
of iron oxides toward quinoline oxidation was highest for 
goethite, much less for the semicrystalline material, and 
essentially negligible in the presence of ferrihydrite.
Lücking et al. [2] tested iron powder, graphite and ac -
tivated carbon for their catalytic properties for the oxida -
tion of 4-chlorophenol in aqueous solution with hydrogen 
peroxide. They concluded that iron powder could be used 
to replace iron salts as a catalyst for the Fenton reaction. 
The disadvantage of Fenton’s reagent is that the homo -
geneous catalyst, added as iron salt, cannot be retained in the 
process, thus causing additional water pollution [2]. In order 
to eliminate this disadvantage, discoloration of azo dye Acid 
Red 18 by the Fenton reagent in the presence of iron powder 
as a source of iron ions was examined in this paper. The ef -
fects of experimental factors such as H2O2 concentration, Fe0 
dosage, and pH on discoloration efficiency were tested. 
Materials and Methods
Dye Wastewater
The simulated dye wastewater was prepared by dilution 
of commercial dye Acid Red 18 ( BORUTA -KOLOR  Sp. z 
o.o., Poland) with water. The dye was of high purity and used 
without further purification. Concentration of dye was 100 
mg/dm3. The wastewater was characterized by an intensive 
red-ponceau color, high clarity and COD = 94 mg/dm3. The 
structure of Acid Red 18 is shown in Figure 1.
Experimental Procedure
The experiments were performed in glass reactors with 
a magnetic stirrer. The dye wastewater was put into reactors 
of 0.25 dm3 volume, and then acidified with H2SO4 to the selected values, as a Fenton reaction is effective in acidic 
pH range. After that, under vigorous stirring, the various 
doses of zero-valent iron powder (< 100 μm, International 
Enzymes Ltd.) and 30% H2O2 were added to the flasks. 
After 15 minutes the samples were alkalized with 0.1 N 
NaOH up to pH 9 in order to prevent further generation of 
hydroxyl radicals. Then, the samples were centrifuged at 
3000 rpm (2.5 min) and analyzed at the maximum adsorp -
tion wavelengths of 510 nm, using a CARL ZEISS TECH -
NOLOGY UV-V IS Spectrophotometer.
Results and Discussion
Effect of H2O2 Dosage
At the beginning, the effect of H2O2 only (without 
Fe) dosage (from 50 to 500 mg/dm3 at 3.5 pH) on color 
removal from simulated wastewater was investigated. 
There was no case in which the visual discoloration was 
achieved and the efficiency of absorbance changed from 
10% to 23% for minimum and maximum dose, respec -
tively. Therefore, further experiments were carried out 
with iron  (H2O2/Fe0 process).Fig. 1. Structure of the azo dye Acid Red 18.

In order to estimate the pH effect on color removal, 
the experiments were conducted at pH values varying 
between 2 and 4. As presented in Figure 3, the best re -
sults and visual discoloration were achieved in the pH 
range 2.5–3.5. However, if the pH value dropped to 2.0, a 
substantial decrease in efficiency of color was observed. 
These phenomena could be explained by the high excess 
of hydrogen ions, behaving as an OH· radical scavenger 
according to reaction [23]:
  OH· + H+ + e- → H2O  (1)
As the pH changed from 3.5 to 4.0, rapid decrease in 
discoloration efficiency was also achieved. A diminishing 
efficiency of H2O2/Fe0 process at pH 4 was in accordance 
with another report that near and above pH 4 rapid hydrogen 
peroxide decomposition, probably on the surface of the ferric 
hydroxide floc, would not produce appreciable amounts of 
available hydroxyl radicals in the solution [24]. 
Effect of Iron Powder Dosage 
on Discoloration Efficiency
As previous papers had reported [3, 8, 20], increasing 
the Fe2+: H2O2 ratio has a great effect on the efficiency of 
the classical Fenton reaction. Therefore, further experi -
ments concern the effect of Fe0 amount on discoloration 
efficiency of the modified Fenton process (H2O2/Fe0). 
Figure 4 presents the removal of color at different Fe0 dos-
ages using a constant H2O2 concentration of 60 mg/dm3.
Experiments concerning the optimization of Fe0 dos-
ages show that in the range of 20–50 mg/dm3 Fe0, color 
removal significantly increases with an increase in Fe0 
amounts. The visual color completely disappeared at 50 
mg/dm3 Fe0 and more. The best results of color removal 
(99.7–99.9%) were achieved at Fe0 dosages in the range 
of 50–400 mg/dm3, but visual discoloration was also 
observed at the higher Fe0 dosages. However, above Fe0 
dosage of 400 mg/dm3, a slight decrease in color removal 
from 99.9% to 99.7% was observed. This inhibitory effect 
at the higher Fe0 dosages could be explained by an obser -
vation (referring to the classical Fenton reaction) that in 
the absence of organic substrates, excessive ferrous ions 
(formed from Fe0 in the H2O2/Fe0 process) are the domi -
nant hydroxyl radical’s scavenger through the following 
reaction [23]:
  Fe2+ + OH· → Fe3+ + OH-  (2)
A very important factor was also the reaction time. As 
shown in Figure 5, absorbance was found to decrease (i.e. 
color removal increase) with the reaction time increase. 
When the reaction time was extended above 15 minutes, 
the visual discoloration was also achieved at the iron pow -
der dosages in the range of 10–40 mg/dm3. These amounts 
of iron powder were not sufficient for total discoloration 
at reaction time of 15 minutes. The visual color complete -Fig. 3. Effect of pH on color removal by H2O2/Fe0 process 
(Fe0 = 1 g/dm3; H2O2 = 60 mg/dm3).
Fig. 4. Effect of Fe0 amount on color removal by H2O2/Fe0 pro-
cess (H2O2 = 60 mg/dm3; 3.0 pH). 
The effect of the H2O2 dosage (from 30 to 150 mg/
dm3) at Fe0 = 1 g/dm3 on color removal from simulated 
wastewater is shown in Figure 2. The color removal effi -
ciency (decrease in absorbance at 510 nm) was increased 
with increasing the dosage of H2O2. As the dosage of H2O2 
increased from 30 to 60 mg/dm3 color removal reached 
99.1-99.7%. When increasing the H2O2 dosage from 60 to 
150 mg/dm3, color removal increased slightly from 99.7 
to 99.8%. In this range, total visual discoloration was 
achieved. At 50 mg/dm3 H2O2 a pale yellow color was 
still observed. Therefore, further experiments concerning 
the optimization of pH and iron dosage were continued at 
H2O2 dose of 60 mg/dm3.
Effect of pH
In aqueous solutions, under acidic conditions, iron 
powder release Fe2+ to the solution. It has been shown that 
the iron powder dissolves faster at lower pH then at high 
pH [19]. This remains in agreement with the fact, that the 
Fenton reaction is effective in acidic conditions. Then, 
Fe2+ will decompose H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals 
according to the Fenton reaction. The optimal pH in the 
range of 2.5-4.0 was reported to be a highly important fac -
tor for effective Fenton oxidation [20-22].�������������

ly disappeared even at 10 mg/dm3 Fe0 after 90 minutes of 
reaction time. Generally, the smaller dose of iron powder, 
the greater reaction time needed for visual discoloration.
Effect of Iron Powder Dosage on Final pH
Figure 6 shows the final pH (after H2O2/Fe0 process) 
at different Fe0 dosages and a constant H2O2 concentra -
tion of 60 mg/dm3. The results show that at Fe0 amount in 
the range of 10–600 mg/dm3, final pH increases linearly 
with an increase in Fe0 dosage. A strict linear correlation 
(R2 = 0.9935) was found between these parameters. This 
phenomenon can be explained by the removal of hydro -
gen ions from the solution as a result of reaction between 
the hydrogen ions and zero-valent iron (Fe0). However, 
further increase in Fe0 dosage (up to 1000 mg/dm3) did 
not cause the final pH increase, which remained between 
5.4–5.6. 
This implies that using excessive amounts of iron 
powder could reach a higher final pH in the H2O2/Fe0 
process. Thus, smaller doses of base will be required for 
final neutralization of wastewater. Moreover, the same 
iron powder can be used repeatedly in the process. The 
above considerations suggest that the H2O2/Fe0 process 
has undoubted advantages in comparison with the classi -
cal Fenton reaction.
Effect of Time between Fe0 and H2O2 Addition 
on Discoloration Time 
Because of the iron powder release Fe2+ to the solu -
tion under acidic conditions, iron dissolution is an initial 
step for the oxidation of contaminants (e.g. dyes) by the 
H2O2/Fe0 process. When dye oxidation occurs, the ini -
tial Fe2+ ions are consumed, and then the oxidation rate 
will depend on the dissolution rate of Fe0. The following 
chemical reactions can be used to describe the mechanism 
of dye oxidation in the H2O2/Fe0 system:
 Fe0 → Fe2+    (3)
 Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH- + OH·  (4)
 OH· + Dye → Oxidized dye + H2O  (5)
Therefore, further experiments were performed at dif -
ferent times between Fe0 and H2O2 dosage. After initial 
acidification of wastewater containing Acid Red 18 to 
pH 3, 200 mg/dm3 of iron powder was added from 0 to 10 
minutes before the optimal dose of H2O2 (60 mg H2O2/dm3) 
was added. The results are shown in Figure 7. As the time 
between Fe0 and H2O2 introduction increased from 0 to 10 
minutes, discoloration time decreased from 11 to 5 minutes. 
An exactly linear correlation (R2 = 0.9868) was observed.
Longer reaction time caused a higher amount of Fe2+ 
ions in solution due to the iron powder dissolution in acid -
ic conditions. Thus, a larger amount of hydroxyl radicals 
is generated in the system and the oxidation rate of Acid 
Red 18 in the Fenton reaction is higher.Conclusions
The examined H2O2/Fe0 process was found to be 
very efficient for discoloration of simulated wastewater 
containing 100 mg/dm3 commercial azo dye Acid Red 
18. The optimal doses of H2O2 and Fe0 were 60 mg/dm3 
and 50 mg/dm3, respectively, at pH 3. At described condi -
tions, total visual discoloration was achieved. Generally, �

the smaller dose of iron powder, the longer reaction time 
is needed for visual discoloration. Visual discoloration 
was achieved in the range 2.5–3.5 pH. If the pH value 
dropped to 2.0 or changed from 3.5 to 4.0, a rapid de -
crease in discoloration efficiency was achieved. It can be 
stated that pH is a highly important factor for effective 
Fenton oxidation.
An exactly linear correlation was observed between 
Fe0 amount in the range of 10–600 mg/dm3 and final pH. 
As the iron powder dose increased, the final pH increased. 
This suggests that the H2O2/Fe0 process has undoubted 
advantages in comparison with the classical Fenton reac -
tion, because using excessive amounts of iron powder 
could reach higher final pH in the H2O2/Fe0 process. Thus, 
smaller doses of base will be required for final neutraliza -
tion of wastewater. Moreover, the same iron powder can 
be used repeatedly in the process. 
It was also found that the time of dissolution of iron 
powder at acidic conditions (before H2O2 was added) is an 
important parameter that influences the rate of discolora -
tion time. A longer time of iron powder dissolution caused 
a higher amount of Fe2+ ions in solution and in conse -
quence, a larger amount of hydroxyl radicals is generated 
in the system. Thus, the oxidation kinetic of Acid Red 18 
in the H2O2/Fe0 process is more effective.
