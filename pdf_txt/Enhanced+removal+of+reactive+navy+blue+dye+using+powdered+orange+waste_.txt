Abstract.  Fly ash obtained from a thermal power station was used as an adsorbent for the adsorption of reactive blue 25 dye from 
aqueous solutions. The parameters affecti ng the batch adsorption studies were optimi zed for this system. Lagergren’s kinetic 
models were used for the analysis of the kinetics of dye adso rption by fly ash. It was observed that dye adsorption followed 
pseudo-second-order kinetics. Batch adsorpti on experimentation data were fitted to two well-known isotherms: the Langmuir and 
Freundlich models. Regression analysis show ed a good fit of the Freundlich isotherm model. Based on the adsorption studies it 
can be concluded that the fly ash can be used as effect ual adsorbent for the removal of dye from aqueous solutions. 
 
Key words:  adsorption, adsorbent, fl y ash, isotherms, kinetics.  
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
* 
Industries such as pulp and paper, leather, cosmetic, 
food, dyeing, etc. discharge effluents containing dyes as major pollutants into water bodies (Bhatnagar and Jain, 
2005). Water bodies containing dyes are toxic to aquatic 
life (Lee et al., 1999) as well as to human beings. As they are carcinogenic and mutagenic in nature, dyes affect 
the functioning of kidneys, liver, and brain (Papic et al., 
2000; Rajeshwari et al., 2001; Kadirvelu et al., 2003). Hence, the treatment of industrial effluents 
containing dyes is important in protecting habitats. 
Removal of residual dye from aqueous pollutants by 
                                                          
 
* Corresponding author, deshannavar@gmail.com the adsorption process has been a topic of interest for 
past several years (Ofomaja and Ho, 2008). 
Adsorption is a simple operation and widely used in 
the tertiary wastewater treat ment stage for polishing the 
incoming influent before its final discharge into water 
bodies (Yin et al., 2008, 2009). Even though activated 
carbon is regarded as an efficient adsorbent, several researchers are focusing their research interest towards 
using agricultural and industrial solid waste materials  
as adsorbents. Fly ash, one of the industrial wastes originating from burning biomass and coal, can be utilized 
as an adsorbent for the treatment of industrial effluents 
containing dyes.  
India is ranked 4th in the world in the generation  
of fly ash as a by-product waste and 75% of the total

power in India is generated by coal-fired thermal power 
stations (Senapati, 2011). One of the coal-based power stations in India, Raichur thermal power station situated 
20 km north of Raichur, Karnataka, India, generates 
1.19 mtpa fly ash, out of which 0.47 mtpa (39.38%) is utilized by the cement industry (0.39 mtpa) and brick 
manufacturers (0.08 mtpa) (Singh, 2015). This shows 
the abundant availability of fl y ash and the need to utilize 
it in an effective manner.  
In the present investigation, fly ash, an industrial 
waste, was used as the ad sorbent for the adsorption  
of reactive blue 25 dye from aqueous solutions. The 
Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were used for the 
analysis of adsorption equilibrium data. The kinetics of the reactive blue 25 dy e adsorption was analysed 
by using Lagergren’s pse udo-first-order and pseudo-
second-order kinetics. The fo llowing sections describe 
the characteristic studies of fly ash and the effect of 
various factors (solution pH, initial dye concentration, 
dye–fly ash contact period, and fly ash dosage) on reactive blue 25 dye removal along with isotherm and 
kinetic studies. 
 
 
MATERIALS  AND  METHODS 
Adsorbent 
 
Fly ash used in the present study was supplied by Raichur thermal power station (RTPS), a coal-based electric power 
station located 20 km north of Raichur in the state of 
Karnataka, India. The fly ash was washed thoroughly with water and dried. The mass fraction passing through 
100 µm and retained on 50 µm was used for the 
adsorption studies. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Zeiss Supra 55 PP) together with energy dispersive  
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (Oxfo rd INCA) were used  
to characterize the surface morphology (Fig. 1) and elemental composition of the fly ash, respectively. The 
elemental chemical composition of the fly ash was 
evaluated using an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) (Philips PW2400) and is summarized in Table 1. 
Fly ash comprises oxides of silicon, aluminium, iron, 
and calcium. Various other oxides are also present but in meagre proportions. The fly ash (Class F) used in the 
present study contains 89.98 wt% SiO
2 + Al 2O3 + Fe 2O3 
and 5.66 wt% calcium oxide. SEM observations reveal  a spherical shape of particles (Convery et al., 2010). 
The N2 BET method (Narkis and Ben-David, 1985) 
employing a Quantasorb surf ace analyser, QS/7, mercury 
intrusion porosimeter, Micrometric model 9310 
(Orumwense, 1996) was used to measure the surface 
area and porosity of the fly ash. The fly ash had a specific surface area of 0.4 m
2/g and porosity of 0.15 cm3/g.

Chemicals  used 
 
Analytical Reagent (AR) gr ade chemicals potassium 
nitrate, hydrochloric acid, and sodium hydroxide, 
products of MERK India, were used in the present study. 
Reactive blue 25 dye was kindly supplied by Forbes Campbell Knitwear, Belagavi. Stock solutions were 
prepared and used in the diluted form for further batch 
adsorption experiments.   
General  batch  adsorption  experiments 
 
All adsorption experiments were conducted in batch 
mode in conical flasks. The solution pH was adjusted 
using NaOH/HCl. A measured quantity of fly ash was 
added. The contents in the flask were agitated in a LABLINE rotary shaker. At regular intervals of time, 
samples were drawn, centrifuged using a REMI laboratory 
centrifuge, and the dye con centration was analysed 
by spectro-photometric analysis (APHA, 1980) using  a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Elico-BL 198) at 600 nm. 
The batch adsorption experiments were conducted varying one variable at a time (OVAT) to investigate effects of 
parameters such as pH, initial dye concentration, fly ash 
dosage, and agitation time on dye removal.  
 
 
RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION 
Point  of  zero  charge 
 
The experiment to determine the point of zero charge 
(pH
PZC) of the fly ash was carried out as described by 
Ofomaja and Ho (2008) and is illustrated in Fig. 2. The adsorbent fly ash had pH
PZC at 5.8. 
 
Effect  of  the  solution  pH 
 
Figure 3 depicts the effect of the solution pH on dye 
adsorption. Batch adsorption studies were performed  
at pH values ranging from 2 to 10. Other factors: dye

initial concentration, adsorbent dosage and adsorbate–
adsorbent contact period were maintained constant as 10 mg/L, 1 g/L, and 1 h, respectively. It can be seen that the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium ( q
e) was 
8.17 mg/g at the solution pH of 2. The corresponding dye removal efficiency was 81.65%. As the solution  pH was increased to 4, the amount of dye adsorbed was drastically reduced to 4.57 mg/g with the corres-ponding dye removal efficiency of 45.67%. With further increase in the solution pH, the amount of dye adsorbed decreased and at pH 10 it was 3.67 mg/g (36.73% removal). Irem et al. (2013), Argun et al. (2014), and Tabak et al. (2009) observed similar trends of decreasing removal efficiency with rising solution pH. Irem et al. (2013) reported a maximum reactive navy blue dye 
removal of 82% at pH 2 with orange waste and Argun et al. (2014) observed a maximum r eactive blue 114 dye 
removal efficiency of 85% at pH 2 using pomelo peel as adsorbent. Tabak et al. (2009) in their study of adsorption of reactive blue 15 anionic dye onto Turkish Sepiolite observed that the removal of dye was maximum below pH 3. In the present investigation a significant dye adsorption was achieved at pH < pH
pzc as reactive blue 
dye is anionic in nature. Similar observations were also made by Reddy et al. (2014) for anionic Congo red dye adsorption onto Bengal gram seed husk.  Effect  of  the  reactive  blue  25  dye  concentration  The effect of the initial r eactive blue 25 dye concen-
tration on dye adsorption is shown in Fig. 4. The batch adsorption experiments to inve stigate the effect of the initial dye concentration on dye adsorption by fly ash 
were carried out by varyi ng the initial reactive blue 25 
dye concentration from 10 to 90 mg/L whereas other factors were held constant: solution pH 2 (optimum value obtained from experiments), adsorbent dosage 1g/L, and contact period between dye and fly ash 1 h. It was observed that at an initial reactive blue dye concen-
tration of 10 mg/L q
e was 8.17 mg/g (the corresponding 
dye removal efficiency, 81.65% ). It increased with an 
increase in the initial dye concentration and qe at 90 mg/L 
was 30.63 mg/g with the corresponding dye removal efficiency of 34.04%. The increase in q
e with increasing 
dye concentration is mainly  due to the decreased mass 
transfer resistance as a result of an increase in the initial dye concentration/driving force and also due to the availability of adsorbent sites. It can also be observed that the dye removal efficiency  decreased with an increase 
in the initial dye concentration.  
Argun et al. (2014) conducted experiments with 
varying initial reactive blue dye 114 concentrations of 
1 mg/L to 200 mg/L and observed decreased removal efficiency from 89% to 20%. Aksu and Isoglu (2006) varied the initial Gemazol turquoise blue-G reactive 
dye concentrations from 51 mg/L to 788 mg/L and observed a decrease in the dye adsorption from 77% to 28%.  
The results obtained from the batch adsorption 
experiments conducted to study the effect of the initial dye concentration on dye adsorption were used to investigate the adsorption capac ity of fly ash for reactive 
blue 25 dye through the well-known Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms.

where ce is equilibrium concentration of adsorbate

The Langmuir adsorption is usually expressed based

where RL is dimensionless constant and c0 is the initial

The Langmuir constants along with the Root Mean 
Square Deviation (RMSD) value are presented in Table 2. The adsorption capacities of activated carbons prepared from various biomass material s for different dyes are 
summarized in Table 3. The maximum adsorption capacity is 131.93 mg/g in the adsorption of reactive blue 
4 onto activated carbon prepared from Enteromorpha 
prolifera  (Sun et al., 2013) and the minimum is 3.53 mg/g 
in the adsorption of reactive orange by activated carbon prepared from walnut shell (Aygun et al., 2003). The fly ash had an adsorption capacity of 37.04 mg/g suggesting that it was an effectual ad sorbent for the removal of 
reactive blue 25 dye.

linear form can be expressed as (Freundlich, 1906)

The Freundlich constants along with RMSD value

5.04 and for the Freundlich isotherm model the RMSD 
value was 4.32. Based on the RMSD values, it is concluded that the dye adsorption onto fly ash follows 
the Freundlich isotherm.

Effect  of  the  adsorbate–adsorbent  contact  time 
 Figure 5 depicts the effect of the adsorb ate–adsorbent 
(dye–fly ash) contact time on reactive blue dye adsorption. Experiments were carried out by keeping the initial dye concentration (10 mg/L), adsorbent dosage (1 g/L), and solution pH (2). After every 10 min of contact time the dye adsorbed by fly ash was calculated. It was observed 
that 6.7 mg/g of dye (67% removal) was adsorbed by fly ash after 10 min of contact and equilibrium was achieved at 50 min of contact time (dye adsorbed = 8.17 mg/g and removal efficiency = 81.65%). Argun et al. (2014) observed optimum removal efficiency of reactive blue 114 dye at 90 min of contact between adsorbate and adsorbent (pomelo peel) and Irem et al. (2013) observed that the adsorption capacity of orange waste increased 
sharply for reactive navy blue dye and attained equilibrium after 120 min of contact time.  
The experimental data so obtained were further 
utilized to investigate the adsorption kinetics. The kinetics of reactive blue dye adsorption by fly ash was analysed by using Lagergren’s pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics.  The linear form of Lagergren’s pseudo-first-order 
kinetic equation is given as (Lagergren, 1898)

Table 4 lists Lagergren’s pseudo-first-order and

be concluded, based on calculated  qe and qe from 
experiments, that the reactive blue dye adsorption by fly ash follows pseudo-second-order kinetics.

Effect  of  the  fly  ash  dosage 
 The effect of the adsorben t quantity on reactive blue 25 
dye adsorption is shown in Fig. 6. In order to investigate the effect of the adsorben t dosage on dye adsorption, 
experiments were carried out by varying fly ash quantities as 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 5 g/L whereas the solution pH, initial dye concentration, and adsorbate–adsorbent contact time were ma intained constant as 2, 
10 mg/L, and 1 h, respectively.  The dye removal efficiency 
of 81.65% was achieved at an adsorbent dosage of 1 g/L and it increased with an increase in th e adsorbent 
dosage. Dye removal efficiency of 88.56% was achieved at an adsorbent dosage of 2. 5 g/L. With further increase 
in the adsorbent dosage, th e dye removal efficiency  
was negligible. This may be due to the overlapping of adsorbent active s ites because of the overcrowding of 
adsorbent particles (Namasivayam et al., 1998).  
The optimum parameters obtained from the batch 
adsorption experiments are given in Table 5 for an initial dye concentration of 10 mg/L.

 An industrial solid waste fly ash was used as an adsorbent for the adsorpti on of reactive blue dye  
from aqueous solutions. A series of batch adsorption experiments were conducte d by adopting standard 
methodologies reported in the literature and optimum 
parameters affecting the adsorption of dye were obtained. It was found that the dye removal efficiency was maximum at the solution pH 2, fly ash dosage 2.5 g/L, and dye–fly ash contact time 50 min for the initial dye concentration of 10 mg/L. The experimental data were used to fit the isotherm models and to analyse the kinetics of dye adsorption by fly ash. It was observed that dye adsorption followed the Freundlich isotherm model and pseudo-second-or der kinetics based on the 
regression analysis. The results indicate that fly ash can be utilized as an effectual adsorbent.

Uuriti soojuselektrijaamade lendtuha kasutatavust Reactiv e Blue 25 värvi adsorbeerimiseks vesilahustest. Antud 
süsteemis optimeeriti adsorptsiooniprotse ssi mõjutavaid parameetreid. Adsorp tsioonikineetikat uuriti Lagergreni 
mudelite baasil, millest nähtus, et värvi adsorptsioon järg is teist järku pseudokineetikat . Langmuiri ja Freundlichi 
isoterme võrreldes järgivad eksperimendiandmed regr essioonianalüüsi põhjal pigem Fr eundlichi isotermimudelit. 
Tulemustest võib järeldada, et lendtuhk on värvi eral damiseks vesilahustest efektiivne adsorbent.
