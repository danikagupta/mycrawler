Abstract   
 
Wastewater contains a variety of toxic dyes and heavy metals. Dyes are released by the different types of industries as 
environmental pollutants which has become a serious issue for the health of thousands of people.  Azo dyes are released 
from the industries as environmental pollutants and are mixed to the drinking water of human due to their direct 
discharge into human inhibited areas. Many techniques are available for the degradation of dyes from wastewater such as 
reverse osmosis, coagulation, ion exchange, photo catalysis, and photo -Fenton etc. However, the traditional photo 
catalysis and photo -Fenton -like catalytic processes are active only under the irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light. The 
photo catalysis invol ves the generation of electron (e−)-hole (h+) pairs under suitable light irradiation.  There are many 
catalysts that have been used in photo catalysis such as ZnO, CdS, TiO 2. TiO 2 is used in the photo Fenton reaction that 
catalyzes the reaction between iron  and hydrogen peroxide. There are many advantages of photofenton reaction such as 
reaction can be carried out with high performance and can be operated at the room temperature.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Wastewater contains a variety of toxic dyes 
and heavy metals. Dyes that damages severe damage to 
changes in the environment and leads health problems. 
Dyes are released by the different types of industries as 
environmental pollution that has been a serious issue for 
the health of people and other habitats that affected due 
to pollution. Dyes in the wastewater are carcinogenic 
and causes the cancer once damage to cells of hum an 
body by interacting the DNA and causing severe 
mutations in structure of normal cells[1 -3]. 
 There is need to remove the toxic dyes from 
the wastewater that can possible through the creating 
the two medium as hydrophobic and hydrophilic for 
breaking the  strong charge interaction in dyes. Many 
techniques are available for degradation of dyes from 
wastewater such as reverse osmosis is used for 
separation of ions, pollutants from the water through the 
membrane, coagulation that also remove the toxic dyes 
from wastewater, ion exchange that exchange the ions 
due large separation of dyes from the wastewater, photo 
catalysis, Fenton process, photo -Fenton are the most 
advanced methods for early degradation of dyes [4 -6].

Fig-1: Shows the different methods of removal of toxic dyes from wastewater  
 
Traditional methods are not reliable due to 
non-functionality under ultraviolet (UV) light and low 
rate of separation of dyes from the wastewater. 
However, the traditional photo  catalysis and photo -
Fenton -like catalytic processes are active only under the 
irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light, which accounts for 
merely 5% of sunlight, and therefore their practical 
applications are limited. The development of visible 
light-driven photo catalysts and photo -Fenton -like 
catalysts is necessary for their applications in the 
wastewater treatment [5-9]. 
 
Although different methods are available for 
removal of dyes as pollutants from wastewater, among 
of all, photo catalytic and photo -Fenton-like catalytic 
processes have attracted remarkable attention for the 
decomposition of dyes, owing to their low cost, mild 
reaction conditions, and easy operation procedures. 
These are industrially suitable methods, environment 
friendly and less cost as compared to the traditional 
methods hence large separation rate of dyes from the 
wastewater due to advanced process in both processes 
[10].  
 
2.1 Role of Photocatalysis in Degradation of Dyes  
Photo catalysis process is used at the 
commercial and industria l level for the degradation of 
dyes from wastewater. It leads to decrease in the 
environmental pollution due to capturing of electrons 
and releases under the redox reaction. The most 
important spinel ferrites are developed due to their 
narrow band gap, mag netic property, and high stability. 
Many researchers have exploited ferrite photo catalysts 
for the photo catalytic degradation of organic pollutants. 
The function of ZnFe 2O4 via a reduction -oxidation 
method, which showed decolorization  of Orange II dye 
in visible light/catalyst/H 2O2 system  [11-13].  
The photo catalysis process involves the 
generation of electron (e−)-hole (h+) pairs under suitable 
light irradiation, the transformation of photo excited 
charges to the surface of photo cat alyst, redox reactions 
of the charges with chemical species to form active 
species, and the degradation of pollutants by the attack 
of active species [14-17].  
 
Photo catalysis has many other advantages 
compared to the other traditional methods such as 
activation of the general catalysis in a way that during 
photo catalysis photons induce catalysis at the time of 
reaction. In the presence of photon ( λ), oxygen acts as 
an electron acceptor and electrons are generated photo 
catalytically by the breakage of  complex dyes. In 
response to visible light, polymeric nanomaterial’s have 
been shown to degrade dye -containing wastewater 
photo catalytically within very short period. Photo 
catalysis is the most industrially used method due to 
low cost of materials utili zed during degradation of 
dyes from wastewater and hence low cost [18 -20].  
 
There are many types of nanoparticles that 
have shown photocatalytic activity against dyes as 
pollutant materials Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide 
have shown excellent photo cataly tic activity due to a 
positive band position that develops more electrons and 
holes under UV light. Recently, the photo catalytic 
capacity has been improved by modifying material 
surfaces using metal doped, non -metal doped and 
coupled systems.  The other na noparticle that have 
strong catalytic activity as zinc oxide have shown 
excellent photocatalytic activity due to a positive band 
position that develops more electrons and holes under 
UV light[21].

Fig-2: Shows the designing mechanism  of photo catalysis and action of nanoparticles  
 
Other types of nanoparticles are used in photo 
catalysts due to supporting materials ease reaction and 
fast removal of dyes. Nanoparticles such as chitosan act 
as support material of metal lic photo catalysts. Owing 
to strong adsorption and high surface area, chitosan 
reduces the amount of intermediates during photo 
catalytic reactions. In addition, chitosan allows quick 
and trouble -free recovery of the photo catalyst, which 
can be recycled with or without any regeneration [22, 
23].  
 
There are many catalysts that have been used 
in photo catalysis such as ZnO, CdS, TiO2. Different 
factors are playing important role in photocatalysis 
process such as band gap and surface area. Most of 
them have  band gap in the UV (ultraviolet) region, i.e., 
equal to or greater than 3.36 eV (λ = 388 nm). Thus, 
these catalysts promote photo catalytic reactions under 
the illumination of UV radiations. Nanowires as well as 
Nanorods are used in degradation of dyes fr om the 
wastewater as indictors of pollutants under 
photocatalysis thus assisting their removal. These 
nanowires as well as nanorods optical properties and 
more surface volume thus employed in all degradation 
Industrial processes [24].  
 
Azo dyes are releas ed from the industrials as 
environmental pollutants and mixed to the daring water 
of human due to their direct intact into human pollution. 
Combinations of nanomaterial’s are used for their 
removal such as oxides of metal as well as biopolymers 
performing degradation of active bands of azo dyes by 
making deforming in structure of azo dyes that 
containing the stabile structure off lots of amines, 
carbon and hydrogen.  Combinations of oxides of metal 
as well as biopolymers in different polymeric structures 
improves the photo catalytic activity against nitrogen 
containing toxic dyes [25].   
 
2.2 Role of Photofenton Reaction  in Degradation of 
Dyes  
This reaction produced the free radicals under 
oxidation of iron. The stable free radicals are formed in 
this reactions are source of hydrogen peroxide. During 
this reaction, Fe (II) that potentially react with H 2O2. It 
resulted he production of large numb er of hydroxyl 
radical (OH•) that could be an important source of 
OH• in sunlit natural waters. It also depends upon on light irradiation that utilized during phtotofeton 
reaction. The introduction of lighter irradiation leads to 
the production of more hydroxyl radical while on the 
other hand, introduction of less light irradiation leads to 
the production of less hydroxyl radical [26 -27]. 
 
Most of nanomaterials are designed in order to 
remove the dyes from waste water using advanced 
engineering technologies . TiO 2 is used in the photo 
Fenton reaction that catalyzed the reaction between iron 
and hydrogen peroxide. Since, this reaction is 
dependent on the light, production of free radicals also 
indicted by light source. This reaction under the 
production of fre e radicals can be utilized for 
degradation of dyes. More of the free radicals generated 
during the reaction, more of the light irradiation and 
more degradation of dyes. While of the less free 
radicals generated during the reaction, less of the light 
irradi ation and less degradation of dyes [26 -27]. 
 
There are many advantages of photofenton 
reaction such as reaction can be carried out with high 
performance and can be operated at the room 
temperature and it catalyzed the reaction of hydrogen 
peroxide by break down them into the water and oxygen 
that acting as environment friendly. There are many 
disadvantages of photofenton reaction such as reaction 
can be carried out at limit pH such as pH 3, also due to 
large volume of iron utilized that finally produced d th e 
large quantities of slug. It also leads to environmental 
pollution [28 -30].  
 
CONCLUSION  
Due to disadvantages of photofenton reaction, 
combination of nanoparticles such as pyrite and Nano 
zero-valent iron called hetero -/homo -geneous  Fenton -
like processes. These nanomaterial’s can be increased 
the efficiency of overall reaction by reducing the slug 
due to iron atoms hence less toxic wastes are produced. 
It ultimately leads to degradation of large amount of 
dyes in water and hence envi ronment friendly.
