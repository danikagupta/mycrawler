Protein identiﬁcation and peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry requires knowledge of how peptides
fragment in the gas phase, speciﬁcally which bonds are broken and where the charge(s) resides in the products.
For many peptides, cleavage at the amide bonds dominate, producing a series of ions that are designated band y. For other peptides, enhanced cleavage occurs at just one or two amino acid residues. Surface-induced
dissociation, along with gas-phase collision-induced dissociation performed under a variety of conditions, has
been used to reﬁne the general ‘mobile proton’ model and to determine how and why enhanced cleavages occurat aspartic acid residues and protonated histidine residues. Enhanced cleavage at acidic residues occurs when
the charge is unavailable to the peptide backbone or the acidic side-chain. The acidic H of the side-chain then
serves to initiate cleavage at the amide bond immediately C-terminal to Asp (or Glu), producing an anhydride.
In contrast, enhanced cleavage occurs at His when the His side-chain is protonated, turning His into a weak
acid that can initiate backbone cleavage by transferring a proton to the backbone. This allows the nucleophilicnitrogen of the His side-chain to attack and form a cyclic structure that is different from the ‘typical’ backbone
cleavage structures. Copyright Ó2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Gas-phasefragmentationofpeptideshasbeeninvestigated
formany years.1–3This work has becomemoreimportant
with the recent development of computer algorithms that
use protein and DNA databases to identify proteins. Cer-
tainprogramsmakeuseoftandem massspectrometrydatato generate sequence tags (short stretches of amino acid
sequence) that can be used to search databases of known
sequence.
4–9A powerful program, Sequest, makes use
of uninterpreted tandem mass spectra and compares those
spectra with ‘predicted’ spectra generated from sequence
stretches in the database that match the measured molecu-lar mass (M
r) of the ‘unknown’.10–13It seems logical that
programs that are designed to produce sequence informa-
tion from spectra could be improved if we could morereadily predict spectra from sequence. It is the goal of
much of our research to explain how peptides fragment
and why certain residues or residue combinations lead tounusual cleavage pathways.
14–20The peptides that frag-
ment in unusual ways generally are not sequenced well
by current algorithms and are not useful in protein iden-tiﬁcation. It is our hypothesis that these peptides could

MOBILE PROTON MODEL
Several research groups have contributed to the devel-opment of a general model for how peptides fragmentin the gas phase; it is the combined knowledge from alarge number of studies that effectively weaves together
to deﬁne and reﬁne the mobile proton model.
2;14;17;21–33
Our group began studies of peptide dissociation by apply-
ing the technique of surface-induced dissociation (SID),an activation method for tandem mass spectrometry thatinvolves collisions of polyatomic ions into organic sur-
faces to cause the projectile ions to fragment
14–20;25;34;35
(G. Tsaprailis, V. H. Wysocki, W Zhong, H. Nair and
J. Futrell, submitted for publication). Much of our earlywork was designed to take advantage of the fact that SIDdeposits a relatively narrow (few eV) distribution of ener-
gies into the ion population and that the average energy
deposited can be easily varied, allowing fragmentationto be examined as a function of systematic changes ininternalenergy.Untilrecently,allofthisresearchwasper-
formed on a tandem quadrupole system, which introduces
the limitation that ions must fragment on a time-scale

of a few microseconds (after collision but before entry
to the quadrupole) in order to be mass analyzed anddetected.
Several studies have been performed in which small
model peptides are dissociated at a variety of collision
energies.
14;18;19;35The peptide structure is systematically
changed so that amino acids of varying basicity areincluded in the peptides. The population of differentprotonated forms of a peptide depends on the internalenergy content of the peptide and the gas-phase basicities
of the different protonation sites of the peptide. When the
fraction of fragmentation is plotted against the collisionenergy to produce a fragmentation efﬁciency curve, thereis a correspondencebetween the basicity of the most basicamino acid and the collision energy required to inducedissociation (on the time-scale of the instrument). These
results are consistent with the idea that fragmentation
of most protonated peptides requires the involvementof a proton at the cleavage site, i.e. that the cleavagesare ‘charge-directed.’ If an amino acid side-chain tightlybinds or ‘sequesters’ a proton, energy will be required
to move that proton from the basic side-chain to the
peptide backbone to induce dissociation. That is, additionofenergy(e.g.byactivationintandemmassspectrometry,MS/MS) alters the initial population of protonated forms(mobilizes the proton) and increases the population of
protonated forms with energies higher than that of the
most stable structure. These protonated molecules exist asa population of ions with the proton located at variousbackbone heteroatoms; the protonation at the backbonesitesinitiates charge-directedcleavagesofthebackbonetoproduceb-and/ory-typesequenceions.Itshould benoted
that, although it is not stated explicitly throughout this
paper, a proton located at a particular basic site generallywill be solvated by other heteroatoms in the system, i.e.there is a tendency to bury charge via intramolecularsolvation.

The energy required for proton ‘mobilization’ from
a basic side-chain or the amino terminus depends onthe amino acid composition, with dissociation energyrequirements greatest for arginine-containing peptides anddecreasingintheorderArg-containing >Lys-containing >
non-basic, mimicking the order of decreasing gas-phase
basicity.
14Inselectedcases,moreenergymightberequired
to mobilize the proton than is required to initiate ‘charge-remote’ fragmentation pathways (i.e. no proton involve-ment) and in those cases different fragmentation pathwaysmay be followed than is normally the case.
The mobile proton model was tested in our group in
several ways.
14–16;18–20Examples are shown in Figs 1
and 2. The top panel of Fig. 1 shows fragmentationefﬁciency curves, plots of fraction of fragmentation vsSID collision energy, for two peptides, RPPGFSPF andPPGFSPFR, that differ in the location of arginine (R).
Singly charged des-R1- and des-R9-bradykinin show the
same high-energy onset for dissociation because in eithercase the charge is sequestered at arginine (top rightcurves labeledC1). When doubly protonated, RPPGF-
SPF shows a lower onset for dissociation than does
PPGFSPFR (Fig. 1A, left). In these peptides, the ﬁrst
proton in each peptide can locate at the highly basicarginine but the second proton is more tightly boundin PPGFSPFR than in RPPGFSPF because the secondmost basic site in PPGFSPFR is the proline at the

amino terminus, a secondary amine. All sites, other than
R, in RPPFGSPF are less basic than the proline freeamino terminus in PPGFSPFR. When two arginines and
two protons are present (bottom curves), the onsets for
dissociation are higher and identical regardless of theterminus on which the two Rs are located, consistent
with the two protons being ‘sequestered’ at the two
arginines.
Figure 2showsfragmentationefﬁciencycurvesforpep-
tides that were derivatized to contain a ﬁxed charge. The
peptide without Arg (R), ’
3PCCH2C(O)LDIFSDF, shows
very different onset energies for dissociation dependingon whether a proton is added or not, consistent with the
added proton being ‘mobile,’ i.e. available to induce dis-
sociation, in [ ’
3PCCH2C(O)LDIFSDFCHC]. When the
ﬁxed charge, Arg, and an added proton are all presentin the fragmenting ion [ ’
3PCCH2C(O)LDIFSDFRCHC],
the dissociation energy is higher than when the ﬁxed
charge and an added proton are present in the absence ofarginine. This is consistent with sequestration or strong
binding of the added proton at the arginine, requiring
extra energy to be input to cause dissociation of thision compared with the ﬁxed-charge ion with an added
proton but no Arg. Both Figs 1 and 2 and our pub-
lished work on multiply protonated dendrimers

the sense that they do not produce contiguous series ofbackbone cleavage sequence ions (e.g. a/b, y). In spite oftheircurrentunpredictableappearance,spectrawith onlyafew major peaks are common as evidenced by the above-mentioned work of Simpson and co-workers.
We present below a summary of our efforts to explain
fragmentationmechanismsfortwocasesofselectivecleav-age of gas-phase peptides: enhanced cleavage at acidicresidues
16;20and enhanced cleavage at protonated histi-
dine(G. Tsaprailis,V. H. Wysocki,W Zhong,H. NairandJ. Futrell, submitted for publication). Additional similar
studies are ongoing, including a reﬁnement of the cur-
rent knowledge of enhanced cleavage at proline. For thisresearch, a variety of different multi-stage mass spectrom-eters are used to follow the dissociation patterns of thepeptides. By applying different activation methods in avariety of instrument types (eV SID, eV CID, keV CID;trapping vs non-trapping instruments), the molecules areactivated by different energy deposition mechanisms anddissociate over different time frames. If the dissociationchemistry persists and dominates throughout these con-ditions, the true unimolecular chemistry of the moleculeis being examined and not some instrument-dependentenhancement of particular ion types. In addition to theapplication of different MS/MS tools, traditional means ofstudying the dissociation mechanisms are applied in these
gas-phase studies, e.g. isotopic labeling, blocking of pro-
posed reaction sites and amino acid substitutions.
Enhanced cleavage at acidic residues
Several authors have noted enhanced cleavage at
acidic residues (aspartic and glutamic acid).
22;23;38;47/NUL49;54
Gaskell and co-workers suggested the involvement of
arginine in peptides that cleave selectively at acidicresiduesandproposedthatside-chaininteractionsbetween
the arginine and the acidic side-chain might explain the
results.
21;24;31;37This explanation has a lot of appeal and
is consistent with much of the experimental data. Thereare certain aspects of the data, however, that cannot beexplained by this model. A series of papers have beenpublished that show that enhanced cleavage occurs C-
terminal to aspartic acid if arginine is present in a peptidethat also contains aspartic acid and if the number ofadded protons is equal to or less than the number ofarginines present.
15;16;19;20This is illustrated in Fig. 3.
A peptide containing two Asp, one Arg and one addedproton, [LDIFSDFR CH
C], shows enhanced cleavage at
both Asp—Xxx bonds [y2and y6, Fig. 3(A)] while the
corresponding compound with two Asp, no Arg and oneadded proton, [LDIFSDF CH
C], cleaves non-selectively
[Fig. 3(B)]. Our explanation for these and related results
is that the arginine(s) tightly binds the proton(s) allowingthe acidic hydrogen of the aspartic acid side chain to bethe ‘reactive’ proton that initiates cleavage as shown inScheme 2. This is supported by data for related peptidesthat have been derivatized to add a ﬁxed charge to theminstead of a proton; even these peptides that contain noadded proton fragment selectively at the aspartic acid[b
2and b6, Fig. 3(C)].16The product of the selective
cleavage at Asp is an anhydride. The anhydride structureis consistent with MS/MS/MS data that show facile lossofCO
