Grape stalks as substrate for white rot fungi, lignocellulolytic
enzyme production and dye decolorization
RESUMEN
Uso del escobajo como sustrato para el crecimiento de hongos de la pudrición blanca, la producción
de enzimas ligninolíticas y la decoloración de tinturas. El objetivo de este trabajo fue evaluar el potencial
del escobajo, un residuo agroindustrial, como sustrato para el crecimiento y la producción de enzimaslignocelulósicas de tres hongos causantes de pudrición blanca en la madera: Trametes trogii, Stereum hirsutum
y Coriolus antarcticus . Para ello se utilizaron técnicas de fermentación en estado sólido. T ambién se ensayó la
decoloración de colorantes industriales sobre estos cultivos. La pérdida de peso seco del sustrato fue similardespués del día 60 (33-43 %). C. antarcticus  produjo las mayores actividades de lacasa y Mn-peroxidasa (33,0
y 1,6 U/g peso seco). La mayor actividad endoglucanasa fue medida en cultivos de S. hirsutum  (10,4 U/g), y la
mayor actividad endoxilanasa en T. trogii  (14,6 U/g). El sistema C. antarcticus/ escobajo mostró un importante
potencial para su aplicación en la biorremediación de efluentes textiles, con porcentajes de decoloración de 93,
86, 82, 82, 77 y 58 % para índigo carmín, verde de malaquita, azure B, azul R brillante de remazol, cristal violeta
y xilidina, respectivamente, en 5 h.

decoloraciónABSTRACT
The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of grape stalks, an agroindustrial waste, for growth and
lignocellulolytic enzyme production via solid-state fermentation, using the following three white rot fungi: Trametes
trogii, Stereum hirsutum and Coriolus antarcticus. The decolorization of several dyes by the above mentioned
cultures was also investigated. Similar values of dry weight loss of the substrate were measured after 60 days(33-43 %). C. antarcticus  produced the highest laccase and Mn-peroxidase activities (33.0 and 1.6 U/g dry solid).
The maximum endoglucanase production was measured in S. hirsutum  cultures (10.4 U/g), while the endoxylanase
peak corresponded to T. trogii  (14.6 U/g). The C. antarcticus/ grape stalk system seems potentially competitive in
bioremediation of textile processing effluents, attaining percentages of decolorization of  93, 86, 82, 82, 77, and 58 %
for indigo carmine, malachite green, azure B, remazol brilliant blue R, crystal violet and xylidine, respectively, in 5 h.

Argentina is a leading wine-producing country in
the world. The quality and productivity of its wineriesare very competitive compared with those of moretraditional wine- producing countries such as France,
Italy and Spain. Given its production output, Argentina
rates as the main Latin American producer and has asignificant growth potential. The Argentine WineProduction Statistics Institute stated that during 2009,crop yields reached approximately 2,137,000 tons ofgrapes and wine production was about 1,076 million
liters (17). This picture also shows the need for
adopting a sustainable management of the resourcesemployed and for recycling the important amount ofresidues produced. Disposal and landfill of those
wastes present environmental and social drawbacks.
New technologies were proposed not only for theirreuse in agriculture, but also for the production ofcommon and novel products for other sectors (31).
Pomace is the main solid residue of wine production,
which contains 45 %  grape skins, 30 %  seeds and
25 %  grape stalks. It constitutes 12 % of a fresh grape’s
weight. In Argentina, it accounts for around 213,000tons/y (17). Grape stalks have a high degree of fibers[lignin (22.94 %), cellulose (29.95 %) and hemicellulose(35.33 %)] and a high percentage of nutritive mineralelements, especially nitrogen and potassium (25). The106 Revista Argentina de Microbiología (2012) 44: 105-112
use of grape stalks in the form of single cell protein
after solid state fermentation (SSF) has been proposed
as ruminant feed or feeding component (32). Results
indicate that, after biological lignin removal, thecellulose is better accessible to rumen microorganisms,and due to its good protein value and low lignin content,
it has a similar value of digestibility as forages (54-
60 %). SSF is another way of producing a variety of
compounds like ethanol, citric acid, gluconic acid,
carotenoids, xanthan, etc. (31).
Enzyme production is a growing field of biotechnology.
Most enzyme manufacturers produce enzymes usingsubmerged fermentation (SmF) techniques. In general,enzyme titers in SSF are higher than in SmF , whencomparing the same strain and fermentation broth(39). White rot fungi (WRF) are so far unique in theirability to completely degrade all components oflignocellulosic materials. Cellulose biodegradation isa synergistic process involving endo- β-1,4-glucanase,
cellobiohydrolase and β-glucosidase. Hydrolysis of
xylans mainly requires the action of endo- β-1,4-
xylanase and β-xylosidase. The capability to degrade
lignin is due to their extracellular nonspecific andnonstereoselective enzyme system composed bylaccases, lignin peroxidases (LiPs) and Mn-peroxidases(MnPs), which function together with H
2O2-producing
oxidases and secondary metabolites (5, 10, 26). Thesame unique nonspecific mechanisms that give thesefungi the ability to degrade lignin also allow them todegrade a wide range of pollutants, among them:polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated phenols,
polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, pesticides, explosives
and dyes (35, 44). Purified laccases, LiPs and MnPsof different fungi are able to decolorize dyes ofdifferent chemical structure (16, 19, 34, 35). All ofthese enzymes are industrially important; thereforeorganisms able to produce them are interesting in view
of the potential importance in industrial processes suchas bioremediation, biobleaching of pulp paper, degradationand detoxification of recalcitrant substances or in thefood industry. Thus, the efficient production of theseenzymes in a low-cost medium is interesting forbiotechnological applications. Moreover, the value-
added conversion of the bioproducts from winemaking
can help in reducing the negative costs and demonstratingsustainability in winemaking (31).
Various agricultural substrates/byproducts and WRF
have been used successfully in SSF for ligninolytic
enzyme production (39). Two closely related substrates
were assayed in SSF for lignocellulolytic enzyme
production: grape seeds, as substrate for laccaseproduction by Trametes hirsuta  (28, 30) and grapevinecutting wastes as substrate for laccase, MnP , cellulose
and xylanase production by Cerrena unicolor  (13). Grape
stalks were assayed as substrate for ligninolyticenzyme production by Phanerochaete chrysosporium
during semi-solid-state cultivation. Grape stalks culturesof this fungus led to a decolorization of around 70 % ofPoly R-478 after 8 days of dye incubation (41). Grapestalks added to sub merged cultures of Trametes
versicolor  induced laccase production. Supernatants
of T. versicolor  cultured in such substrate proved their
capacity to decolorize phenol red (25) and indigocarmine (27).  But as  far as we know,  grape stalks had
never been assayed before as sole substrate for theproduction of lignocellulolytic enzymes by WRF in SSF.
Several studies have demonstrated the ability of
WRF to decolorize synthetic dyes. However, moststudies on dye decolorization have been carried outusing liquid culture conditions or solid cultures onagar plates, which, however, do not reflect the naturalliving conditions ( e.g. in wood and other lignocellulosic
substrates) of WRF. SSF was chosen here because
it mimics the natural environment of the WRF. Textile
dye decolorization has been demonstrated with cell
suspensions, immobilized cells, crude enzymatic
extracts and purified ligninolytic enzymes (1, 12, 16,
19, 20). The major drawback to using an enzymepreparation is that once the enzymes become
inactivated, decolorization activity ceases. However,
with a whole cell culture, the enzymes could becontinually replenished. Immobilized cultures tend tohave a higher level of activity and are more resilient to
environmental perturbations such as pH, or exposure
to toxic chemical concentrations than suspensioncultures (33, 38). Immobilization by encapsulation in amatrix such as alginate may be too costly for
wastewater treatment, while surface immobilization on
an inexpensive material such as woodchips orlignocellulosic wastes is cheaper (43).
Trametes trogii (BAFC 463),  Coriolus antarcticus
(BAFC 266), and Stereum hirsutum  (BAFC 2234) are
Argentinean strains of WRF that had proved to beefficient ligninolytic enzyme producers in previousstudies (21, 23, 24, 30). Their ability to decolorize a
wide range of textile dyes has been recently
demonstrated (12, 16, 20, 22, 23, 29). The aim of thiswork was to evaluate the potential of grape stalks assupport for their growth and lignocellulolytic enzyme
production under solid state conditions. The in vivo and
in vitro  decolorization of several dyes, by the above
mentioned cultures was also investigated in order toassess their degradative abilities.Fungal lignocellulases and decolorization in grape stalks 107
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fungal strain and culture conditions
Trametes trogii  (BAFC 463; MYA 28-11), S. hirsutum  (BAFC
2234) and C.  antarcticus (BAFC 266) (Basidiomycota) were
obtained from the Centro de Colecciones de la Facultad de
Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires(BAFC), and maintained at 4 ºC on ME agar (malt extract 1.2 %,
glucose 1 %, agar 2 %) slants. Incubation was carried out at 28
ºC under stationary conditions in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks for
up to 60 days. Grape stalks cut into pieces of 3-5 cm [15 g per
Erlenmeyer (dry basis)] was used as solid substrate for cultures,
moistened with 20 ml of distilled water and 5 ml mycelial
suspension (inoculum) (initial moisture content 65 %). Themedium was autoclaved for 20 min at 121 ºC, and aseptically
inoculated with the mycelial suspension. To prepare the inoculum,
Erlenmeyer flasks containing ME medium were inoculated with
one agar plug (25 mm
2) cut out from the margin of a 5-day-old
colony grown on ME agar and incubated for 5 days at 28 °Cand the mycelium obtained was blended in three cycles of 15 s.
For all experiments, measurements were carried out in triplicate
parallel cultures. The values are reported as the mean with a
standard deviation of (SD) less than 10 %.
Sample preparation
Weight losses were determined on the basis of the initial and
final dry weights, drying the content of each flask to constant
weight at 80 °C. Enzyme extraction: crude extracts wereobtained by adding 5 ml of distilled water per g wet solid, to the
contents of each flask, stirring for 20 min, followed by
centrifugation. The supernatants were stored at -20 ºC until
enzyme determination.
Enzyme assays
Laccase activity (E.C:1.10.3.2) was measured with 2,2'-
azino bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) in 0.1
M sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.6). Oxidation of ABTS was
determined by the increase in A420 (ε420 = 36/mM cm) (8). Mn-
peroxidase  activity  (MnP) (E.C:1.11.1.13) was measured using
phenol red as the substrate in 0.1 M sodium dimethylsuccinate
buffer (pH 4.5) (ε610 = 22/mM cm) (14). Lignin peroxidase activity
(LiP) (E.C:1.11.1.14) was assayed by the azure B method (2).
Ligninolytic activities were measured at 30 ºC. Endo- β-D-1,4-
glucanase (E.C:3.2.1.4), and endo- β-D-1,4-xylanase (E.C:3.2.1.8)
activities  were determined by measuring the reducing sugars
released  from carboxymethyl cellulose or oat xylan, respectively,
as substrates, in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, at 50 ºC.
Liberated reducing sugars were quantified by the Somogyi-Nelson
method (45), using either glucose or xylose as standards.
International enzymatic units (U) were used (µmol/min). Enzymatic
activities in the extracts recovered from the solid-state cultureswere reported in U/ml. In terms of production, the activity was
defined as U/g dry residue (substrate plus mycelium) (U/g).
In vivo  decolorization experiments
The reaction mixture contained in 1g wet material (substrate
plus fungus, 40 days post-inoculation) in 10 ml of different dyes
(concentration 100 μM). Six dyes belonging to five different
classes were analyzed. Decolorization was determined by
measuring the decrease of dye absorbance at its maximumvisible wavelength  505, 588, 592, 608, 618, and 650 nm,
respectively for: xylidine [acid red 26: azoic dye, CI (colour
index N. º): 16150], remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR, reactive blue
19: anthraquinone dye, CI 61200), indigo carmine (acid blue 74:
indigoic dye, CI 73015), malachite green (basic green 4:triphenylmethanic dye, CI 42000) and crystal violet (gentian
violet: triphenylmethanic dye, CI 42555), and azure B
(heterocyclic dye, CI 52010). The initial pH of the solutions was5.2 for all dye systems. An abiotic control (substrate without
fungus) was conducted in parallel. A blank treatment containing
no dye was used as a control to evaluate possible color changes
due to water extractives liberated by the fungal colonized
substrate. Results are expressed as percentage of dye
decolorization after 5 h.
In vitro  decolorization experiments
The decolorization capacity of the cell-free  extracts was
also evaluated. The reaction was carried out in test tubes at
30 ºC. The reaction mixture contained 1 ml of crude filtrate, and
either 20 µM of  malachite green or 30 µM of the other dyesassayed. Boiled extracts were used as controls.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Growth characteristics: dry weight loss and
reducing sugars
Time course of reducing sugars and dry weight loss
of the substrate are shown in Figure 1. Loss in total
dry weight in the substrate was measured after 60 d of
fermentation (33-43 %). Data for reducing sugars,produced by enzymatic substrate hydrolysis showedthat on day 40 they had been almost completelymetabolized.
Enzyme activities
The time course of lignocellulolytic enzyme
production by T. trogii, C. antarcticus and S. hirsutum,
in SSF using grape stalks as substrate was studied.Extracts from cultures were assayed to determine theactivities of cellulases, xylanases, and ligninases.
Figure 2 illustrates the lignocellulolytic enzyme profiles.
Laccase (Figure 2A), MnP (Figure 2B), endoglucanase
(Figure 2C) and endoxylanase (Figure 2D) weremeasured. Attempts to detect LiP were unsuccessful.
If produced in this medium, LiP levels could be too lowto be detected (2). On the other hand, the extractionprocedure may not have been appropriate to guarantee
the recovery of the enzymes adsorbed on the substrate
(46). LiP activity had been previously detected inanother T. trogii  strain (11). Regarding ligninases, the
highest laccase activity (33 U/g) was produced by C.
antarcticus  after 40 d. On that same date, this fungus
also produced  the peak of MnP (1.62 U/g); afterwards
both activities decreased sharply. Maximum
endoglucanase titers were produced by S. hirsutum
after 60 d (10.44 U/g). The highest endoxylanase levels(14.56 U/g) were detected in T. trogii  after 20 d of
cultivation, but this activity decreased to virtually zeroon day 60 post-inoculation. Endoglucanase production
by T. trogii  followed a similar pattern. Laccase activity

activities of S. hirsutum , and C. antarcticus  endoglucanase
activity reached their peak value on the last samplingday. All these activities, with the exception of the
endoglucanase activity from S. hirsutum,  showed a
lineal increase from day 20 to the last fermentation day.Therefore, higher enzyme activities might have beenachieved if the cultivation time had been prolonged.
Ligninolytic systems of WRF are mainly activatedduring the secondary metabolic phase of the fungus(5). But the three fungi growing in SSF, which were
assayed in this study, produced hydrolases along withoxidases also during trophophase in parallel with growth
(taking into account that on day 20,  glucose was not
depleted from the medium), showing that these
enzymes may not be secondary metabolites.
Previously, lignocellulosic substrates had shown
to efficiently induce high amounts of ligninolyticenzymes in other white rot basidiomycetes, forFigure 1.  Time course of dry weight loss (A) reducing sugars (mg/ml of aqueous extract) (B) when culturing T. trogii , C. antarcticus

example some of the highest records of laccase
production were obtained in Coriolopsis rigida  (108
U/g) (15) and T. hirsuta (68.4 U/g) (40),  both fungi grown
on barley bran. The deuteromycete Aspergillus awamori
produced 40.4 U/g of endoxylanase and 9.6 U/g ofendoglucanase when grown in SSF on grape pomace(7). Although the activities attained in this work arelower than those recorded in such substrates, this isthe first report proving the feasibility of using grape
stalks as substrate for SSF lignocellulolytic enzyme
production by WRF. Because of its low cost, worldwideabundance and the resulting high levels of enzymeproduction, the SSF using grape stalks as principalsubstrate could be used to scale up the productionof lignocellulases.
Dye decolorization
The cultures of the three fungi demonstrated potential
to decolorize a broad spectrum of chemically differentdyes. All the dyes tested were decolorized to someextent, with varying percentages of decolorization (Table
1). Forty-day-old cultures of C. antarcticus  showed the
highest ability to decolorize the different dyes assayed(in coincidence with maximal laccase and MnP activitiesdetermined), attaining percentages of decolorization ofabout 93, 86, 82, 82, 77, and 58 % for indigo carmine,malachite green, azure B, RBBR, crystal violet and
xylidine, respectively, in 5 h. Decolorization was due to
two simultaneous effects: the physical process ofadsorption on the mycelium, and the enzymaticdegradation caused by the ligninolytic enzymesproduced by the fungi. Decolorization due to adsorptionon the support was negligible, as determined with the
abiotic control. Extracting dyes (with alcoholic extraction
solution) from heavily colonized substrates forquantification proved difficult. Nevertheless, the role ofadsorption in dye decolorization appears to be minimal.The dyes were rapidly removed from the medium, as aresult of the physical adsorption process, but  they were
later eliminated both from the solution and the matsurfaces,  as a consequence of the enzymatic degradation.
Similar results were obtained recently, when adsorption
of a textile dye by dead biomass pellets of T. versicolor
was determined and compared with dye removal byenzymatic degradation (4), while adsorption demonstratedto be important in dye decolorization by Pestalotiopsis
guepinii  (42).
The results obtained in this work are in coincidence
with previous decolorization studies applying thesethree strains. The ability of S. hirsutum  to decolorize
and detoxify indigo carmine, xylidine and malachitegreen under SSF conditions using either: wheat bran,soya bran or a mixture of both (1:1), had been previously
investigated  (29). Seventeen-day cultures on soya bran
showed the highest decolorization values: 68 % forxylidine (20 µM) after 120 min of contact time, 90 % formalachite green (10 µM) after 90 min. Cultures on wheatbran/soya bran showed to be more efficient to degradeindigo carmine (20 µM) (95 % after 30 min).
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a
correspondence between decolorization bands andlaccase activity bands; thus, laccase activity could beassociated with the process of dye decolorization.Detoxification assays were carried out, using theextraction liquid from malachite green degradation.
Detoxification of malachite green was up to 100 % after
2 h of contact time (29). T. trogii (BAFC 463) is an
outstanding producer of laccase. In an optimized SSFwood-based medium supplemented with malt extract,peptone and copper, it produced up to 901 U/g of laccaseand 20 U/g of MnP (21). While in SmF T. trogii  extracellular
fluids which rendered the highest ligninolytic production
(45.32 U/ml laccase, 0.21 U/ml MnP) also showed thegreatest ability to decolorize the dyes xylidine, malachite
green and anthraquinone blue at rates of 2.14; 1.35 mgand 3 mg dye/l x h, respectively (22). Eighteen day-

old C. antarcticus  cultures on ME medium were able
to decolorize 28 -100 % of five different dyes added inan hour, representing decolorization rates of 5.3, 3.9,
6.6, 22.5, and 22.5 mg/l x h of malachite green, RBBR,
xylidine, indigo carmine and Poly R-478,  respectively
(23). The different rates reflect different capacities ofthe cultures to remove dyes with diverse chemicalstructures. Indigo carmine is a dye, which was shownto be easily decolorized by different wood rotting
fungi. It can be degraded either by purified laccase,
LiP or MnP (16, 34, 36, 37) Jarosz-Wilkoazka et al.
(18) also demonstrated that anthraquinonic dyes weredecolorized by fungi easier and faster than azoic dyes.A low efficiency of decolorization of some azoic dyescompared to other dye types was also reported for P.
chrysosporium and T. versicolor (49). Microorganisms
do not readily degrade azoic  dyes. Sulpho and azoic
groups do not occur naturally, thus  sulphonated azoic
dyes are recalcitrant to biodegradation. Biodegrada-bility of azoic dyes depends on the presence of veryspecific changes in their molecular structure. Anthraqui-
none, azoic and indigoic dyes were decolorized by the
laccase of T. versicolor;  however, the mechanism of
laccase-catalyzed decomposition was differentdepending on dye structures. Anthraquinone wasdirectly oxidized by the laccase, azoic and indigodyes were not the substrates of laccase and small
molecule metabolites mediated the interaction
between the dyes and the enzyme. The decolorizationrate of nonsubstrate dyes was limited by theconcentration of mediating compounds rather than by
laccase activity in the solutions (47). When screeningdye decolorizing abilities of WRF , azure B is among
the most recalcitrant
 dyes. This dye is used to detect
LiP activity because it is not oxidized by laccase or
MnP alone, but it was partially decolorized in the
presence of the mediators (2, 9). With the addition of
the natural mediator p-coumaric acid, about 60 %decolorization was achieved in 2 h with Trametes
villosa  laccase (9). The azure B decolorization ability
of Flavodon flavus   was tested in ME broth; about 50 %
decolorization was achieved after 24 h (36). In the present
work, C. antarcticus  cultures decolorized 82 % of this
dye after 5 h. Decolorization rates obtained in the presentstudy were comparable to or even exceeded thosepreviously reported for the fastest dye-degrading WRF,among them: T. versicolor  and P. chrysosporium . C.
antarcticus  capacity to decolorize the azo dye xylidi-
ne (6.6 mg/l x h) is similar to that previously describedfor T. versicolor  in relation to different azo dyes (3 mg/l x
h (6) and 5 mg/l x h (48)), and is comparable to that of
T. versicolor  to decolorize RBBR (3-7 mg/l x h (6)).
Moreover, its ability to decolorize azure B is
outstanding.
The crude extracellular extracts were able to
decolorize some of these dyes but not as efficientlyas the cultures (Table 2). In a previous work, when T.
versicolor  was grown in a submerged culture with
glucose as carbon source and the addition of grape
stalks, it produced 400 U/l laccase and 36 U/l MnP
(27). Sixty-two percent decolorization of phenol red (75µM) after 72 h was observed when applying theligninolytic fluids obtained in the abovementionedcultures (25), while indigo carmine (60 µM) was almostcompletely decolorized after 48 h by the extracellular
fluids from T. versicolor  grown under the same
conditions (27). In our study, the best decolorization wasobtained for indigo carmine (74 % after 2 h). Similarly,while Pleurotus ostreatus  decolorized 12 of 23
industrial dyes when grown on solid media, the crudeextracellular extracts were able to decolorize only 5
dyes, showing that other enzymatic mechanisms could
be involved in dye decolorization in vivo  experiments
(37). Although laccase and MnP were detected in cell-free extracts of the three fungi assayed, probably H
2O2
or other necessary factors involved in the catalytic

cycle of the enzymes were lacking. These enzymes
and their associated components such as H2O2 are
present extracellularly, but in biobleaching studies with
T. versicolor , Archibald (3) has shown that they must
be constantly replenished from active biomass.Mycelial presence becomes significant if decolorizationrequires such biomass-associated factors.
In conclusion, grape stalks appear to be a good
choice when searching for lignocellulosic materials to
immobilize cultures of WRF for decolorization purposes.
The three fungi assayed colonized it very readilyproducing laccase and MnP activities, the biomass wasnot easily sloughed off, its integrity was maintained overa long period of time and decolorization rates of a broadspectrum of dyes were high. Moreover,  the utilization
of this material also helps to solve pollution problems
caused by its disposal. Considering the magnitude ofthe decolorization obtained, the C. antarcticus/ grape
stalk system may be employed in the bioremediationof colored effluents without the help of any mediator.
