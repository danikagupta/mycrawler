The human NQO1 (hNQO1) is a flavin adenine nucleotide (FAD)-dependent
oxidoreductase that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinones to hydro-
quinones, being essential for the antioxidant defense system, stabilization of
tumor suppressors, and activation of quinone-based chemotherapeutics. More-
over, it is overexpressed in several tumors, which makes it an attractive cancerdrug target. To decipher new structural insights into the flavin reductive half-
reaction of the catalytic mechanism of hNQO1, we have carried serial crystal-
lography experiments at new ID29 beamline of the ESRF to determine, to the
best of our knowledge, the first structure of the hNQO1 in complex with
NADH. We have also performed molecular dynamics simulations of freehNQO1 and in complex with NADH. This is the first structural evidence that
the hNQO1 functional cooperativity is driven by structural communication
between the active sites through long-range propagation of cooperative effects
across the hNQO1 structure. Both structural results and MD simulations have
supported that the binding of NADH significantly decreases protein dynamics

1|INTRODUCTION
The human NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase
1 (hNQO1) is a flavo-oxidoreductase essential for theantioxidant defense system, stabilization of tumor sup-
pressors, and activation of quinone-based chemothera-
peutics (Pey et al.,
2016 ; Ross & Siegel, 2017 ). Alterations
in hNQO1 function are associated with cancer and with
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, making this enzyme
an attractive target for drug discovery (Beaveret al.,
2019 ). hNQO1 is a homodimer of 62 kDa with two
identical 31 kDa interlocking protomers and two active
sites. These active sites are located at the interface
between the two protomers consisting of two domainsthat involve residues from both polypeptide chains and
the corresponding two noncovalently bound flavin ade-
nine nucleotide (FAD) cofactors, one at each catalytic site(Asher et al.,
2006 ; Faig et al., 2000 ; Li et al., 1995 ; Skelly
et al., 1999 ). hNQO1 primarily catalyzes the two-electron
reduction of quinones to hydroquinones by a two-stepmechanism commonly known as “ping-pong ”(Anoz-
Carbonell et al.,
2020 ) (Scheme S1), in which the electron
donor molecule NAD(P)H enters the active site and
donates a hydride to the FAD cofactor reducing it to thehydroquinone state (namely FADH
/C0). Then the oxidized
NAD+leaves the active site, and it is eventually replaced
by a quinone substrate that is subsequently reduced to itshydroquinone form by FADH
/C0.
Crystal structures of hNQO1 with and without the
inhibitors dicoumarol and cibacron blue, chemothera-peutic drugs, and the substrate duroquinone, have shown
that hNQO1 undergoes local conformational changes in
which the active site opens and closes during the catalysis(Asher et al.,
2006 ; Faig et al., 2000 ; Lienhart et al., 2014 ;
Winski et al., 2001 ). However, the difficulty of obtaining
structural and dynamic information on many of the
intermediate states by standard macromolecular crystal-lography at synchrotrons, has limited the understanding
of the redox mechanism of hNQO1. Other biophysicaltechniques including isothermal titration calorimetry,
hydrogen/deuterium exchange, absorption spectroscopy,
and stopped flow have supported the hypothesis that the
two active/binding sites of hNQO1 act cooperatively anddisplay highly collective inter-domain and inter-
monomer communication and dynamics (Clavería-
Gimeno et al.,
2017 ; Pacheco-Garcia et al., 2021 ;
Pey, 2018 ; Pey et al., 2014 ). This coupled network of
amino acids is sensitive to ligand binding as it decreases
protein dynamics significantly and stabilizes hNQO1especially at the dimer core and interface. Such observa-tion provides experimental evidence for the two active
sites in the homodimer catalyzing the hydride exchange
with different rates being driven by structural communi-cation and the breaking and formation of hydrogen
bonds and salt bridges across the hNQO1 protein struc-
ture (Anoz-Carbonell et al.,
2020 ; Pacheco-Garcia
et al., 2021 ,2022 ). For this reason, understanding the
hNQO1 redox mechanism and the conformational
dynamics upon interaction with substrates is critical tounravel its roles as an antioxidant and potential target totreat cancer, neurological disorders and cardiovascular
diseases (Beaver et al.,
2019 ; Betancor-Fern /C19andez
et al., 2018 ). However, a detailed structural explanation
for these observations, and the derived mechanistic
implications, is difficult to provide by standard crystallog-
raphy as crystal freezing might select one conformationabove others (Fraser et al.,
2011 ).
Despite x-ray crystallography being the main way of
uncovering the three-dimensional structures of bioma-cromolecules, traditionally, it has been viewed as a static
technique, with limited applicability to study protein
dynamics, which fundamentally relies on multiple con-formational states and the transitions between them.However, owing to the convergence of several recent
experimental and technical developments, x-ray crystal-
lography is increasingly well-positioned to provideinsights into the connection between protein flexibility
and function. In this regard, the development of new2o f2 2 GRIECO ET AL .

light sources, such as x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs)
and sample handling procedures, has brought about aresurgence of room temperature crystallography through
so-called serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). Also,
the high intensity of state-of-the-art synchrotron sources,combined with ultrafast detectors, has enabled similar
experiments in the form of serial synchrotron crystallog-
raphy (SSX). To date, the number of room temperatureSSX experiments (more than 60 experiments) has grown
exponentially since the first experiment was conducted in
2014 (Gati et al.,
2014 ). A further development is repre-
sented by the advent of diffraction-limited storage rings(Raimondi et al.,
2023 ), capable of providing a much
more brilliant beam at the sample position and allowing
to perform diffraction experiments at short time scales.The new ID29 is the first beamline completely dedicated
to room temperature serial crystallography at a fourth-
generation storage ring. Recently, we have shown thebenefit of room temperature data collection using SFX by
determining the SFX structure of hNQO1 (Doppler
et al.,
2023 ). Our results revealed that several residues in
the catalytic site, described to play a key role in the func-
tion of the protein, show an unexpected flexibility within
the crystals (Doppler et al., 2023 ). This high plasticity of
hNQO1 in the catalytic site provided us with the firststructural evidence that the hNQO1 functional negative
cooperativity is driven by structural communication
between the active sites through long-range propagationof cooperative effects across the protein structure.
In the work presented here, we have conducted one
of the first SSX experiments at the new ID29 beamline atthe ESRF Extremely Brilliant Source (ESRF-EBS) to
determine, to the best of our knowledge, the first struc-
ture of the hNQO1 in complex with NADH. Until now,the only structure of an NQO1 protein in complex withNADP
+was reported by Li et al. ( 1995 ) from rat liver.
However, no structure was ever deposited in the PDB.
With the goal of obtaining the first structure of thehNQO1 in complex with NADH, we have conducted SSX
experiments at ID29 beamline of the ESRF-EBS, as well
as performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations toconfirm our experimental observations. The results pre-
sented here will pave the way for future TR-SX studies
both at XFELs and synchrotrons to study the dynamics ofhNQO1 upon binding of NADH. This knowledge will
allow us to reveal unprecedented structural information
of the kinetic mechanism that determines the catalyticfunction of hNQO1. Furthermore, gaining insights intothese functional aspects of hNQO1 at the molecular level
will be valuable to advance in the design of new, more
potent, and effective inhibitors that can be used in clini-cal realm.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 |Expression and purification of
hNQO1 protein
Protein expression and purification of hNQO1
(EC 1.6.99.2) were performed as previously described
(Doppler et al., 2023 ). Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21
(DE3) cells containing the DNA sequence of hNQO1
were grown overnight in LB culture medium supple-
mented with 0.1 mg/mL ampicillin (LBA) at 37/C14C. This
culture was diluted in 4 L of fresh LBA and grown at37
/C14C until the optical density at 600 nm reached a
value between 0.6 and 0.8. Expression was then induced
with IPTG (isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) at a
final concentration of 0.5 mM. Induced cells were fur-
ther incubated for 4 h at 28/C14C, harvested by centrifuga-
tion and resuspended in 40 mL of binding buffer (BB;20 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, and 50 mM
imidazole at pH 7.4) containing one EDTA-free protease
Inhibitor tablet. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice.Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm at
4
/C14C for 40 min. The supernatant containing hNQO1
was filtered through 0.45 μm filters and subsequently
loaded onto immobilized Ni2+affinity chromatography
column previously equilibrated with BB. After collecting
the flowthrough, the column was washed with 20 col-
umn volumes (CVs) of BB and eluted with 10 CVs ofelution buffer (BB containing 500 mM imidazole). The
eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mM K-HEPES at
pH 7.4. NQO1 was further purified by size exclusionchromatography using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex
200 prep grade (GE Healthcare) column using the elu-
tion buffer 20 mM K-HEPES pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl,1 mM FAD. Pure protein was concentrated to a finalconcentration of 25 mg/mL, flash frozen and stored
at/C080
/C14C.
2.2 |Protein crystallization
Microcrystals of hNQO1 were obtained on-site at the
ID29 Serial Macromolecular Crystallography (SMX)
beamline at the ESRF-EBS by the batch with agitationmethod as follows: in a 3 mL glass vial, 150 μL of the pro-
tein solution at 25 mg/mL were added dropwise to
450μL of the precipitant solution (0.1 M Tris pH 8.5,
0.2 M sodium acetate, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350)while stirring at 200 rpm. Upon addition of the protein,
the solution turned turbid immediately and needle-
shaped crystals of about 10 –30μm in their longest dimen-
sion (Figure

1 h. Microcrystals of hNQO1 with the ligand NADH were
obtained by the soaking method as follows (Figure S1B):
a NADH solution of 100 mM was prepared in the protein
crystallization buffer, then 5 μL of this solution were
taken out, mixed with 50 μL of the original crystal slurry
and incubated for 1 h before data collection. Microcrys-
tals, initially yellow, turned clear immediately upon mix-
ing, indicating the reduction of the enzyme by NADH.
2.3 |Sample delivery using a small
SOS chip
Microcrystals of hNQO1 and hNQO1 with NADH at the
concentration of 108crystals/mL were loaded by pipet-
ting 3.5 μL of a crystal slurry and sandwiched between
two 13 μm mylar films on a small version of the sheet-
on-sheet sandwich chip (SOS chip) (Doak et al., 2018 )
with an opening of 5 /C210 mm. The mylar –mylar sand-
wich containing the crystal slurry was held in place and
sealed by the sample holder. The mylar –sample –mylar
sandwich was placed between the two half frames of the
chip holder leading to further spreading and thinning of
the film by capillary action. The two frame halves werethen sealed together with one clamping screw. Figure
1a
illustrates how sample loading in the SOS chip was
carried out.2.4 |Serial synchrotron data collection
at the new ID29 beamline
The SSX data were collected at the new ID29 SMX beamline
( O r l a n se ta l . ,m a n u s c r i p ti np r e p a r a t i o n )o ft h eE S R F - E B Susing a wavelength of 1.072 Å with a pulse length of 90 μsa t
repetition rate of 231.25 Hz. The x-ray beam flux at the sam-
ple was about 8 /C210
14ph/s and focused to 4 /C22( H/C2V)
μm (FWHM). Data were recorded with a newly developed
MD3upSSX diffractometer (Arinax and EMBL-GR) and a
JUNGFRAU 4M detector (Mozzanica et al., 2018)w i t hi n t e -
gration time of 95 μs to ensure full recording of the x-ray
pulse and automatically corrected for pedestal and geometri-
cal reconstruction with a LI mA2 data acquisition library
developed at the ESRF ( https://limagroup.gitlab-pages.esrf.
fr/lima2/ ). The sample-to-detector distance was set to
150 mm. The final data collection statistics for both proteins,
free hNQO1 and hNQO1 in complex with NADH (hNQO1--NAD
+/H) are given in Table 1. The experimental setup is

All data processing was carried out remotely, after the
experiment, using the new Virtual Infrastructure for

and place the chip in the chip holder; (2) place a mylar film over the chip; (3) apply the sample on the mylar film, place another mylar filmon top and screw again; (4) remove the excess mylar film; and (5) chip loaded and mounted. (b) Schematic diagram of the setup. A 1%
bandwidth x-ray beam with a pulse length of 90 μs at repetition rate of 231.25 Hz was used. The x-rays hit the sample that is immobilized in

Scientific Analysis (VISA; https://visa.esrf.fr ). Initial
hit-finding was performed using a GPU version of Nano-
PeakCell (Coquelle et al., 2015) implementing Peakfinder8
algorithm (Kieffer et al., 2022). As hit finding parameters
we used an SNR of 5.0 and a threshold of 1200. The Bragg
reflections were integrated using the software package
CrystFEL (White, 2019;W h i t ee ta l . , 2012) (version 0.10.1)after indexing was attempted with CrystFEL's indexamajig
using the algorithms XGANDALF (Gevorkov et al., 2019),
MOSFLM (Powell, 1999), and ASDF, in that order. The
detector geometry file was further optimized by the geopti-
mizer tool (Yefanov et al., 2015).
MTZ files for phasing and refinement were generated
by the CTRUNCATE program (Evans, 2011 ) from theTABLE 1 Serial x-ray data collection and refinement statistics.

CCP4 software package (Winn et al., 2011 ) and a fraction
of 5% reflections were included in the generated R freeset.
Initial phases of free hNQO1 and hNQO1-NAD+/H were
obtained by molecular replacement with MOLREP
(Vagin & Teplyakov, 1997 ). For the free hNQO1, we used
our recently published SFX structure (PDB 8C9J
[Doppler et al., 2023 ]) as the search model. In the case of
hNQO1-NAD+/H, we used the free hNQO1 structure
from this study as the search model. The obtained models
were refined using alternate cycles of automated refine-
ment using non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) withREFMAC5 (Murshudov et al.,
2011 ) and manual inspec-
tion was performed with COOT (Emsley et al., 2010 ). The
final refined structures were validated using the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) validation service before deposition.The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been
deposited in the PDB with accession codes PDBs 8RFN
and 8RFM for the free hNQO1 and the complexhNQO1-NAD
+/H, respectively. The final refinement sta-
tistics of both proteins are given in Table 1. Electron den-
sity and simulated-annealing OMIT maps mF o-DF cwere
calculated with the MAPS tool in the PHENIX software
suite (Adams et al., 2010 ). All figures of the free hNQO1
and hNQO1-NAD+/H structures presented in this manu-
script were generated with UCSF CHIMERAX (version1.2) (Meng et al.,
2023 ) or PYMOL (version 2.4.0)
(Schrödinger LLC).
2.6 |MD simulations
Structural models of the hNQO1 protein were derived
from former crystallographic data, PDB: 1D4A, selecting
Chains A and C to form the homodimer structure. TheFAD cofactors were retained in their respective activesites. The positioning of NADH was manually adjusted
based on similar protein structures with ligands (PDB:
2F1O, 1DXO), and particularly considering the stereo-chemistry of the model early reported by Li et al. (
1995 )
and expected from experimental kinetic studies
(Anoz-Carbonell et al., 2020 ), and similarly adjusted in
both protomers. Before initiating any MD simulation, the
structural models were prepared by removing all water
molecules and the fine-tuning of the protonation of resi-dues at pH of 7.0 utilizing the PROPKA software (Olsson
et al.,
2011 ). MD simulations were carried out using
GROMACS 2018.4 software (Abraham et al., 2015 ), and
the protein parameters were defined with the AMBERff03 force field (Duan et al.,
2003 ). Standard residue
topologies were assigned using the GROMACS pdb2gmx
tool, while FAD and NADH molecules were parame-trized using ab initio methods. Atomic charges for each
atom were determined through the restrainedelectrostatic potential technique using Multiwfn (Lu &
Chen,
2012 ), following structure optimization at the
HF/6-31G(d,p) level in Gaussian 09 (Frisch et al., 2009 ).
These charges served as the initial parameters for the
subsequent parametrization using the GAFF force field(Wang et al.,
2006 ) via ACPYPE (Sousa da Silva &
Vranken, 2012 ). To set periodic boundary conditions, the
system was enclosed within a rhombic dodecahedronbox. Explicit water molecules were modeled using
the TIP3P model. Neutralization of the system involved
the replacement of random solute molecules with sodiumions. Before running production simulations, the studiedsystems underwent steepest descent minimization to alle-
viate close contacts or clashes. Equilibration was
achieved through short 500 ps simulations under theNVT ensemble, with initial velocities generated according
to a Boltzmann distribution at 310 K and therefore differ-
ent for each replicate. Subsequently, a 500 ps simulationunder the NPT ensemble at 1 atm was conducted. During
both equilibration stages, harmonic potentials with a
force constant of 1000 kJ/(mol nm) were applied torestrict the movement of the heavy atoms in the protein
and ligand. Once the desired equilibrated conditions were
met, the productive MD phase began with unrestrainedpositions for all atoms except hydrogen atoms, whichwere constrained using the LINCS algorithm
(Hess,
2008 ). Simulations were performed under an NPT
ensemble at 310 K with a leap-frog integrator using 2 fstime steps, and data were collected every 10 ps. Long-
range electrostatic interactions were computed using the
Particle Mesh Ewald method, pressure was controlled viathe Parrinello –Rahman method, and temperature equili-
bration was maintained through a modified Berendsen
scheme. The simulations extended up to 200 ns, and eachtrajectory was replicated five times. All MD simulationswere executed on the CESAR supercomputer system at
BIFI. Analysis of the simulations was performed using
with custom scripts using GROMACS tools, the MDTrajlibrary (McGibbon et al.,
2015 ) and PyMOL
(Schrödinger LLC).

3.1 |Experimental setup at the new ID29
beamline
Serial crystallography data collection was performed at
ID29, a brand-new energy tunable beamline at the 6 GeV
storage ring of the new ESRF-EBS (Raimondi
et al., 2023 ), the first high-energy fourth-generation syn-
chrotron (Grenoble, France). A more detailed description
of the beamline will be found in Orlans et al. (manuscript6o f2 2 GRIECO ET AL .

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License

the fixed target serial crystallography data collection plat-form developed at ID29. Crystal slurry was delivered to
the x-ray beam using a small version of the SOS chip
(Doak et al.,
2018 ) at room temperature (290 K). The
exposure area on the chip was 4 /C28 mm and was sam-
pled collecting diffraction images every 10 μm steps
apart, in xandy, respectively. The scanning speed, which
is defined by the beam pulses repetition rate and spacing,
was 2.3 mm/s, implying that the sample is moving
0.2μm during the x-ray pulse. The sample-to-detector
distance was 150 mm that was equivalent to 1.8 Å at thedetector corners. This will change in the near future, so
that datasets to resolutions as high as 1.2 Å in the detec-
tor corners at 1.072 Å wavelength can be achieved. Aschematic view of the experimental setup used at ID29 is
shown in Figure
1b. For the free hNQO1 sample, a total
of 21 μL (six chips) of crystal slurry were consumed for a
complete data set. In the case of NQO1 with NADH, we
consumed 24.5 μL of crystal slurry from seven chips.
3.2 |Room temperature crystal
structures of free hNQO1 andhNQO1-NAD+/H
Despite the mylar sheets leading to three narrow rings on
the detector, these were of sufficiently low intensity as tocause no difficulties in data analysis. A representative dif-
fraction pattern for the complex hNQO1-NAD
+/H is
shown in Figure S2. The hit rate varied from 80% to 87%.
To prevent crystals from damaging effects, we collected
data using a 10 /C210μm raster scan spacing at the cen-
ters along horizontal and between rows, respectively. Atotal of 82,000 images were collected per chip in 8 min,which is too short to even observe dehydration effects so
that no humidification was needed. Some images with
multi-crystal diffraction were observed. All data collec-tion statistics are listed in Table
1.
Microcrystals of free hNQO1 belonged to the space
group P2 12121with the following unit cell dimensions:
a=62.0 Å, b=108.0 Å, c=200.0 Å, α=β=γ=90/C14,
and diffracted to a resolution of /C242.5 Å resolution. To
solve the structure of the free hNQO1, a total of 492,000frames were collected from five SOS chips (40 min), of
which 302,781 were classified as hits by CrystFEL. About
33% of the identified hits could then be indexed, givingrise to a total of 101,165 indexed, integrated, and mergedlattices. The structure was solved by molecular replace-
ment using the PDB entry 8C9J of the SFX structure of
free hNQO1 previously reported by Doppler et al. (
2023 ),
as a search model without the FADs, water, and ion mol-
ecules. The structure was refined at a resolution of 2.7 Åwith R work and R freeof 19.87% and 23.87%, respectively.
Figure S3illustrates the two physiological homodimers in
the asymmetric unit (ASU) related by a non-
crystallographic twofold axis of symmetry and showing
the typical folding characteristic of hNQO1 (Bianchetet al.,
2004 ). In the case of the complex hNQO1-NAD+/
H, the microcrystals belonged to the space group P2 12121
with shorter unit cell lengths dimensions: a=61.1 Å,
b=106.8 Å, c=196.0 Å, showing that crystals shrink
upon the binding of the NADH. The same hit finding
and indexing procedure used for free hNQO1 was appliedfor the case of hNQO1-NAD
+/H. With 574,000 frames
collected from six chips (48 min), an initial number of
344,574 hits were identified, of which /C2460% were suc-
cessfully indexed giving rise to individual 105,083 crystallattices. The structure was solved by molecular replace-
ment using the structure of hNQO1 (this study) as search
model. The structure was refined at a resolution of 2.7 Åwith R
work and R freeof 19.85% and 24.25%, respectively.
The final data collection and refinement statistics for this
structure are given in Table 1, while Figure 2illustrates
the two physiological homodimers in the ASU.
The two structures could be modeled in the electron
density from the N-terminus to the C-terminus withoutinterruptions and with excellent stereochemistry(Table
1). The Ramachandran diagrams place nearly all
residues within the favored and allowed regions, with
only a few of them falling into the outlier region(Table
1). The resulting experimental maps were of excel-
lent quality revealing, besides the presence of FADs,
other solvent molecules such as water molecules: 76 inthe free hNQO1 and 17 in the hNQO1-NAD
+/H models.
The high-quality of the hNQO1 structures can be
assessed from the electron 2mF o-DF cdensity maps
shown for the catalytic site residues and the FAD cofac-tors (Figures
3aand S4for hNQO1-NAD+/H and free
hNQO1 structures, respectively). Simulated-annealing
OMIT maps mF o-DF cwere calculated after removing the
NAD+/H molecules from the refined model. The strong
positive electron density (Figure 3b,c), where original
coenzyme molecules were, is in good agreement with thefinal structural model and confirms the lack of model
bias and, thus, the presence of the coenzyme in the
model. Due to fact that the free hNQO1 andhNQO1-NAD
+/H datasets are non-isomorphous (unit
cell lengths a,b, and cvary 1, 1.2, and 4 Å, respectively),
Fo-Fomaps were not calculated (see Section 3.6for an
explanation of this). It is important to note that theNAD
+/H molecules found in our structure are not bound
to the same homodimer, but one of them is bound to one
active site of one of the homodimers and the other one isbound to one of the active sites of the other homodimer
in the ASU (Figures
2and3). Also, the exact position andGRIECO ET AL . 7o f2 2

orientation of both NAD+/H molecules differs from one
active site to another.
3.3 |Structural comparison of free
hNQO1 and hNQO1-NAD+/H and with
related structures
As mentioned above, the binding of the hydride donor
NADH to hNQO1 led to an important reduction or
shrinking of the unit cell lengths of up to 4 Å in the
cdimension (Table 1), which shows the high flexibility of
hNQO1 molecules within the crystal lattice. These differ-
ences in the unit cell dimensions are reflected when
aligning the two homodimers of the free hNQO1 andhNQO1-NAD
+/H structures (Figure 4a). A further analy-
sis of the two structures with PISA server (Krissinel &
Henrick, 2005 ) was carried out in which the FAD and
NAD+/H molecules were removed. This analysis showed
that the number of total contacts in the complex
hNQO1-NAD+/H (6242) was significantly higher thanthat for the free structure (4588), indicating that the bind-
ing of the NADH molecules rigidifies hNQO1. Conse-quently, the higher number of contacts observed in thecomplex led to an average reduction in the surface and
buried areas of 1000 and 100 Å
2, respectively (Table S1).
Also, the number of hydrogen bonds throughout thestructures was 399 in the complex and 351 in the free
structure. A further analysis of the contacts occurring at
the homodimer interfaces shows that, overall, althoughthe total number of inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen
bonds is just slightly higher in the case of the complex
(171 hydrogen bonds for the complex and 167 for the freestructure) (Tables
S2–S13), a redistribution of the hydro-
gen bonds across the interface was produced. Figure 4b,c
illustrate the intermolecular hydrogen bonds observed
for the two homodimers of the free hNQO1 andhNQO1-NAD
+/H structures.
A further evaluation of the hNQO1-NAD+/H complex
was carried out by comparing it with previously reportedcrystal structures of hNQO1 both unliganded (free
hNQO1 [this study], PDB 8C9J [Doppler et al.,
2023 ], and

NADH (computational model [this study]), the inhibitorPMSF (8OK0 [Grieco et al.,
2023 ]), the natural substrate

2017 ]) and Cibracron blue (PDB
4CF6 [Lienhart et al., 2014 ]), as well as a prodrug mole-
cule (PDBs 1GG5 [Faig et al., 2001 ]). Overall, all NQO1
homodimer structures aligned very well with each other,
with RMSD values for all atoms between 0.301 and
0.852 Å and with an average value of 0.423 Å. A superim-position of all structures is shown in Figure
S5A. As one
could expect, the higher structural differences are mainly
found in the loop regions, the solvent exposed regions, as
well as in the catalytic site regions, where the side chainsof several residues differ in conformation (Figure
S5B).3.4 |Structural changes in the active site
of hNQO1 upon binding of the hydridedonor NADH
Since we have recently observed the existence of a high
conformational heterogeneity of hNQO1 in the catalytic
site with some of the residues being modeled in different
conformations (Doppler et al., 2023 ), the structural
changes of the catalytic sites of both structures, the free
hNQO1 and hNQO1-NAD+/H, were analyzed individu-
ally. Analysis of the hNQO1 protein with CASTp pro-gram (Tian et al.,
2018 ), shows that, overall, the catalytic
pocket of hNQO1 buries a total area of 824.02 Å2(volume
694.64 Å3) that is found at the dimer interface and com-
prises the binding pocket for the FAD molecule and theNAD
+/H molecule.

3.4.1 | The FAD binding site
Firstly, we carried out the analysis of the FAD catalytic
pockets in the free hNQO1 and the hNQO1-NAD+/H
structures. As described previously by Bianchet et al.
(2004 ) and Li et al. ( 1995 ), the FADs are stabilized by
establishing hydrogen bond interactions with residuesfrom one of the monomers of the homodimer that arelocated, primarily, at the bottom of the active site. In that
study, it was assumed that the interactions established by
the FAD and the protein residues were equivalent in thetwo FAD binding sites, however, since our structure is a
room temperature structure and based on previous
results from our group (Doppler et al.,
2023 ), we decided
to analyze the FAD sites from all chains in the ASU. In
fact, we have observed some differences between the two
binding sites of the two homodimers of both structures(Figures
5andS6; Table 2) that might be relevant to the
hNQO1 function. Overall, the interactions between
the FAD and the free hNQO1 include in general the twooxygen and all nitrogen atoms of the isoalloxazine ring ofFAD and some of the residues located in one of the
monomers including Trp105, Phe106, Gly149, Gly150,
and Tyr155 (interactions 1 –3 and 5 –9 in Figure
5). In
addition, two of the oxygens of the ribitol fragment of the
FAD are hydrogen bonded to Leu103, Leu 104, andThr147 (interactions 10 –15 in Figure 5). The diphosphate
moiety hydrogen bonds, in general, with His11, Phe17,
Asn18, and Thr147 of the main protomer, and occasion-
ally with Gln66 of the other protomer (interactions 16 –24
in Figure 5). Finally, the ribose/adenine moiety lies in a
pocket composed of residues Thr15, Ser16, Phe17, Asn18,
and Arg200 of the same protomer together with Asn64and Gln66 of the neighbor protomer, interacting mainlywith Arg200 through the adenine, although interactions
with Asn64 of the second protomer through the ribose
are also observed (interactions 25 –30 in Figure
5). A
more detailed illustration of all hydrogen bond interac-
tions established by the FAD and the protein in free
hNQO1 are shown in Figure S6and Table 2. A similar
interaction signature was observed in the FAD binding
site of the hNQO1-NAD+/H structure (Figures 5andS7;
Table 2), which indicates that the binding of the
NAD+/H molecules to the protein does not alter, at least
not significantly, the FAD binding site. However, some
variations in the hydrogen bond distances establishedbetween the FADs and the protein residues wereobserved when comparing both the free hNQO1 and the
complex hNQO1-NAD
+/H (Table 2).
A further comparison of the FAD binding sites of
the two homodimers in the ASU of both the free
hNQO1 and the complex hNQO1-NAD+/H is shown in
FIGURE 5 Schematic representation of all hydrogen bond interactions occurring at the FAD binding site. (a) The binding site
comprises most of the residues of one protomer and only two residues (Asn64* and Asn66*) of the other protomer. All interactions havebeen numbered from 1 to 30 (as listed in Table
2) and highlighted using the same color code as in Table 2: Green for all interactions at the
isoalloxazine moiety, blue for all interactions at the ribitol moiety, yellow for all interactions at the phosphates moiety, and pink for all
interactions at the ribose and adenine moieties. Important to note that, for clarity, all residues, the FAD and the water molecule have beenmoved and displaced from their original positions in the structure, as well as all the interactions have been exaggerated. (b) Two-
dimensional representation of the chemical structure of the FAD molecule. Atoms have been colored with the same code used for the
interactions in (a). All hydrogen bond interactions were evaluated using PYMOL (Schrödinger LLC), which uses the Kabsch and Sander'sDSSP secondary structure assignment algorithm (Frishman & Argos,
1995 ) considering a maximum cut-off distance of 3.5 Å and a minimum
angle of 90/C14for hydrogen bond formation.10 of 22 GRIECO ET AL .

Figure S8A,B . As can be seen, no significant differences
were found for the protein residues. However, althoughall FAD molecules showed a similar conformation fromone to another within the active sites of each structure,
with the biggest differences found in the ribose and
adenine moieties (Figure
S8C,D ), some relevant differ-
ences were found when comparing the FAD molecules
between the free hNQO1 and the hNQO1-NAD+/Hstructures (Figures S9and S10). As can be seen, the
binding of the NADH induces conformational changesin all the FAD molecules, being more significant, over-all, in the isoalloxazine ring (Figures
S9) and the ribose
and adenine moieties (Figure S10). Also, and rather sur-
prisingly, the biggest changes are produced in the FADsof Chains A and C, in which no NAD
+/H molecules
are bound.TABLE 2 Hydrogen bond interactions established between the FAD molecules and the protein residues in the free hNQO1 and the

Furthermore, water molecules also seem to play a rel-
evant role in the stabilization of the FADs. Bianchet et al.(
2004 ) reported the presence of three water molecules
coordinating the ribitol and diphosphate moieties of
FAD. Although none of these water molecules werefound in the structures reported in this study, we found
others. In this regard, in our free hNQO1 structure there
is a conserved water molecule right above the isoalloxa-zine ring that interacts, in two of the chains (Chains B
and D), with its N5 atom (interaction 4 in Figure
5). In
the other two chains (Chains A and C), this water mole-cule hydrogen bonds with Tyr128 (not shown). This isthe first time these water molecules have been reported
for hNQO1, which may have important implications in
the stabilization of FAD and/or binding of NADH.Unlike in the free hNQO1, no water molecules were
found in the FAD binding sites of the hNQO1-NAD
+/H
structure. The absence of such water molecules in ChainsB and D is justified by the presence of the NAD
+/H mole-
cules, which may displace them. In the case of the water
molecule found in Chains A and C, the absence of thiswater molecule could be justified by conformational
changes caused in these active sites by NADH binding at
the others.
3.4.2 | The NAD+/H binding site
In our structure, we have captured the hydride donor
NAD+/H in two different positions. We have observed a
coenzyme molecule bound to the catalytic site of one ofthe homodimers through Chain B (NAD
+/HB), and
another coenzyme molecule bound to the catalytic site of
the other homodimer through Chain D (NAD+/HD)
(Figures 2and3a). The fact that the hydride donor mole-
cule is found in just one catalytic site of each homodimer
agrees with the negative cooperativity previously reported
in literature during hydride transfer (Anoz-Carbonellet al.,
2020 ). Because the interaction of the coenzyme
NADH is transient, as it must leave the catalytic site
upon hydride transfer so that the redox reaction con-tinues, it must have fewer specific interactions with the
protein than FAD.
NAD+/HDmolecule
The electron density maps 2mF o-DF caround the NAD+/
HD(Figure 3a) indicate that the side face of the nicotin-
amide motif of the NAD+/HDis stacked right on top of
the middle ring of the isoalloxazine of FAD, thus estab-
lishing a Van der Waal interaction of 3.4 Å distance with
FAD (interactions 1 and 2 in Figure 6a). It is important
to note that in this conformation the distance between
the two atoms involved in the hydride exchange, the C4of the nicotinamide (C4N) and the N5 of the FAD, is
3.4 Å (not shown). In addition, the NAD+/HDis further
stabilized by five more interactions that involve residues
of the same protomer that binds FAD and residues of the
other protomer (Figure 6a). The carboxyamide moiety
makes hydrogen bonds with His161 and Tyr128 (interac-
tions 3 and 4 in Figure 6a). One hydroxyl of the ribose
makes hydrogen bond with an oxygen of the ribose of theFAD molecule (interaction 6 in Figure
6a). The oxygen of
the ribose also establishes an interaction with Tyr128
(interaction 5 in Figure 6a). Lastly, the second phosphate
moiety of NAD+/H interacts with His194 (interaction
7 in Figure 6a). All these interactions are shown in
Figure 6a, and their distances listed in Table 3. As the
microcrystals, initially yellow color, turned clear rightafter they were mixed with the NADH and the coenzyme
molecule is pointed with its A face towards the isoalloxa-
zine, we assume that the NAD
+/HDmolecule found at
the catalytic site may presumably be NAD+, which has
transferred the Pro-R hydride ion to the FAD, reducing it
to FADH/C0(Anoz-Carbonell et al., 2020 ).
NAD+/HBmolecule
As mentioned above, there is an additional hydride donormolecule bound to Chain B of the other homodimer(Figure
2). Figure 6bshows the interactions established
between this NAD+/HBmolecule and the enzyme. The
nicotinamide ring is parallel to the benzyl ring of the resi-due Tyr128, thus establishing a pi-interaction (interaction
4 in Figure
6b). The carboxyamide is interacting with
His161, Tyr128, and the isoalloxazine ring of FADthrough its N1F (interactions 1 –3 in Figure
6b). Two
more interactions are established between the two ribose
sugars and protein residues His194 and Asn233 (interac-tions 5 and 6 in Figure
6a). All these interactions are
shown in Figure 6b, and their distances listed in Table 4.
Based on our complex structure and the orientation of
this hydride donor molecule, it is hard to know whetherit has reacted (or not) with the FAD so that this molecule
could be either on its way to the catalytic site (as NADH)
or on its way out from it upon reaction (as NAD
+).
3.5 |Dynamic properties of FAD and
NAD+/H and how they correlate with x-ray
structures
The static picture provided by the crystal structures is not
sufficient to fully understand highly dynamic processes
such as the conformational changes occurring at and
near the catalytic site during competent allocation ofNADH in the active site to achieve subsequent hydride
transfer from the C4N of the nicotinamide of NADH to12 of 22 GRIECO ET AL .

+/H sites, the structure and dynamics
of hNQO1 homodimers, in the free and in the NADHcomplex states, were investigated by MD simulations. In
all cases, the FAD cofactor was simulated in its oxidizedstate, while NADH was in its reduced state. Thus, gener-
ated models for the complex would correspond to that for

S11A shows the RMSDs for the C αof the five rep-
licates along the entire MD simulation for the free
hNQO1and hNQO1-NADH models. Noticeably, the most
relevant differences occur at the FAD and NADH bindingsites (Figure
7; Molecular Movies V1and V2). In good
agreement with what we observed in the crystallographicresults (Figure S5), residues at the FAD and, particularly,
NADH binding sites show high flexibility. Among the
highest ones are those observed at residues Asn64,Gln66, and Arg200, interacting with the ribose and ade-
nine motifs of the FAD, and Tyr126, Tyr128, Phe232, and
Asn233, interacting with the nicotinamide and adenineof NADH (Figures

hNQO1 and the hNQO1-NADH models, the two catalytic
sites behave as independent sites throughout the simula-tions, showing different protein-FAD and protein-NADH
signatures in terms of interaction frequency and motional

flexibility, as reflected in Figures 7and S12–S15 and
Tables S14–S19. A more detailed analysis of what hap-
pens during the simulations at both the FAD and NADH
binding sites is described below.
3.5.1 | The FAD binding site
Regarding the FAD, in agreement with the crystal struc-tures, the position of residues interacting with the isoal-
loxazine ring is rather stable, but flexibility considerablyincreases in those interacting with the ribitol moiety and,particularly, with the adenosine monophosphate (AMP).
All this is quantitatively reported in Tables
S14andS15,
which illustrate how the polar interactions involving thenicotinamide (shown in Figure
5) are in general popu-
lated between 70% and 100% of the simulated time in the
evaluated replicates, while those for the AMP portion areconsiderably less populated. More in particular, polar
interactions with the adenine moiety are hardly stabi-
lized, leaving it free to move with fixed position. In thisregard, the Arg200 has been seen to interact sometimes
with the ribose ring and sometimes with the adenine.
Furthermore, the analysis of the RMSD and RMSF-B fac-tors of FAD during the simulation time show that therearrangement and movement of the two cofactors
within the hNQO1 homodimer are not symmetrical
(Figures
S12A ,S13A , and S14A ; Table S19). As average, a
twofold ratio is observed for the FAD RMSD of one pro-
tomer regarding the other within the hNQO1 homodi-
mer, while RMSF-B factors particularly show higherdispersion in the position of the adenine atoms regarding
those of the FAD cofactor. Remarkably, average values
for dispersion of FAD RMSF-B factors are relatively high,particularly at the adenine moiety. In other words, theconformation/position of the FAD seen in one of the
active sites of the protein is not the same as that seen in
the other active site at the same time, and the active sitesof hNQO1 are characterized by a high cofactor mobility.
Noticeably, in the presence of NADH, an overall decrease
in FAD fluctuation is also observed (Figures
S12B ,S13B ,
and S14B ; Table S19), with again the FAD molecule of
one catalytic site showing more fluctuation than the
other.
3.5.2 | The NADH binding site
Regarding NADH, the nicotinamide ring moves within
its binding cavity (Figures 7,S12C ,S13C , and S14C ;
Tables S16–S19), being in general almost kind of parallel
to the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor (Molecular
Movie V2). Nonetheless, it explores alternativeconformations (Molecular Movie V2), being even
observed in some frames of replicate 4 at one of the activesites in positions nearly perpendicular to the FAD
(Figure
7c), adopting, interestingly, a conformation that
resembles that observed for the NAD+/HBmolecule of
the crystal structure (Figure 6b). The position of the resi-
dues that interact with NADH changes along the simu-
lated time and replicates, but it is particularly thenicotinamide the moiety that is anchored to the protein
in a parallel conformation to the FAD isoalloxazine
(Figure
7d; Tables S16–S18; Molecular Movies V1and
V2), like what was observed for the NAD+/HDmolecule
of the crystal structure (Figure 6a). Large mobility is
envisaged for the NADH from its RMSD values, while
RMSF-B factors for its different atoms confirm its AMPportion as more flexible than its nicotinamide
(Figures
S12C ,S13C , and S14C ; Table S19). Same as in
the crystal structures, Tyr126 and Tyr128 show high flexi-bility (Figure
S11), but the OH of Tyr126 usually stacks
against the nicotinamide ring along with residues Phe178
and Trp105, keeping the nicotinamide buried(Figures
S15and S16). Also, Tyr128 pairs its OH with
opposite nicotinamide and stays generally in that posi-
tion, although occasionally it flips over and interacts itsOH with the O7N and/or N7N atoms of NADH(Molecular Movie
V2). The rest of the NADH molecule is
very flexible, exploring multiple conformations, and hav-
ing few polar interactions with protein residues, as wellas with the FAD. This was also observed in the crystal
structure of the complex hNQO1-NAD
+/H (this study).
All this can be seen in Figures S12C ,S13C ,S14C , and S15
and Tables S16–S18. These data illustrate high RMSD
values for the NADH molecules at both active sites and
the highest RMSF-B factor values at the AMP moiety ofNADH. Moreover, they also show how the polar and pi-
stacking interactions shown in Figure
6for the crystal
structure of the hNQO1-NAD+/H complex vary during
the entire simulation. Furthermore, as observed withFAD, the conformation/position of the NADH molecule,
and particularly of its nicotinamide regarding the isoal-
loxazine of FAD, is not symmetrical throughout the sim-ulations, thus showing differential fluctuation at the two
catalytic sites (Figures
S13C andS14C ).
3.6 |Crystal packing of hNQO1
homodimers in microcrystals differs fromthat in large crystals
A further evaluation of the hNQO1 crystal packing was
carried out by comparing the two hNQO1 crystal struc-tures presented in this study with the crystal structures
recently published by our group for hNQO1 in theGRIECO ET AL . 15 of 22

absence of NADH coenzyme (PDB 8C9J, [Doppler
et al., 2023 ]) and hNQO1 in complex with the inhibitor
PMSF (PDB 8OK0) (Grieco et al., 2023 ). Although all
these structures were obtained from crystals grown in the
exact same crystallization conditions, the rearrangementof the double hNQO1 homodimer observed in the ASU
for the structure with PMSF differs from that observed in
structures from microcrystals (Figure
8a). Regardless of
the crystal structure, a structural alignment of the indi-vidual two hNQO1 homodimers leads to all hNQO1
homodimers aligning very well with each other (not
shown). However, when the two homodimers are sub-jected, at once, to a structural alignment, clear differences
arise in that one of the homodimers always alignsperfectly well while the other does not (Figure
8a). A
visual analysis of the two homodimers showed that thehomodimers rearrangement in the microcrystals differs
significantly from that observed in the large crystals.
A further analysis of the homodimers interface with
the PISA server (Krissinel & Henrick,
2005 ) shows that
the two homodimers in the room temperature structures
of the free hNQO1 (PDB 8C9J [Doppler et al., 2023 ]; and
this study) and the complex hNQO1-NAD+/H (this
study), enclose a surface area that is similar in size
(930 Å2on average), while the cryo-structure of hNQO1
in complex with PMSF (PDB 8OK0 [Grieco et al., 2023 ])
buries a smaller surface area of 775 Å2. From this analy-
sis, we have also found out that there are significant

differences in the residues that participate in the inter-
faces between the two homodimers. As can be seen inFigure
8bfor the homodimers in the microcrystals, they
are kept by interactions established by the two protomers
of one of the homodimers and just one protomer of theother homodimer with no participation from the other
one. However, in the case of the large and cryo-cooled
crystals, the two homodimers are kept through interac-tions established by all the protomers of the two homodi-
mers (Figure
8c). A schematic diagram of how this
homodimer rearrangement occurs in the microcrystalsand in the large crystals can be seen better in Figure
8d,e.
Putting all this together, we hypothesize that the way we
produce our microcrystals at high supersaturation
reached very fast increasing the nucleation rate, influ-ences the way the two homodimers are rearranged within
the crystals.
To further confirm this hypothesis, the crystal pack-
ing analysis was extended to other structures of hNQO1
in which large crystals were obtained from very similar
or identical crystallization conditions such as PDB 5A4K(Lienhart et al.,
2017 ) and 5EA2 (Pidugu et al., 2016 ) for
the free hNQO1, and 6FY4 (Strandback et al., 2020 )
for the hNQO1 in complex with the ligand BPPSA, asmall molecular chaperone. All these three structuresshowed two homodimers in the ASU as well. A compari-
son of these three structures with that of hNQO1 in com-
plex with PMSF (PDB 8OK0) (Grieco et al.,
2023 ), shows
that the homodimers exhibit the same rearrangement
within the large crystals (Figure S17A ), this being differ-
ent from the homodimer rearrangement observed in themicrocrystals (Figure
S17B ).
4|DISCUSSION
4.1 |hNQO1 is fully active in
microcrystals showing they are suitable fortime-resolved experiments
Proteins are not static entities but rather they fluctuate
between alternative conformational states defined by a
complex energy landscape (Frauenfelder et al., 1991 )t o
accomplish their biological functions. The redistributionor“population shift ”of the conformational ensemble is
the basis of cooperativity and allosterism (Hilser,
2010 ;
Motlagh et al., 2014 ). Structural and biochemical studies
of oxygen-carrying tetrameric hemoglobins have had apivotal role in explaining the phenomenon of cooperativ-
ity and allostery (Kavanaugh et al.,
2005 ). X-ray crystal-
lography has traditionally been viewed as a statictechnique, with limited applicability to allostery and
cooperativity. The reason for that is because, typically,protein crystals tend to be seen as static entities and
therefore unsuitable for studying allosteric and coopera-tivity, given that these events involve conformational
changes. However, it has been known for a long time that
most enzymes remain catalytically active within crystals(Doscher & Richards,
1963 ), although the environment
within a crystal lattice has little resemblance to the actual
cellular environment of a protein. Proteins are highlydynamic molecules, but even though the lattice restrains
their accessible conformational space, they retain a
remarkable degree of plasticity (Forneris et al.,
2014 ) and
often display surprisingly large-scale conformationalchanges during ligand binding (Stagno et al.,
2017 ). The
accessible conformational space depends on how the pro-
tein is packed in a given crystal form, and analysis ofmultiple crystal forms gives a more complete picture
of the conformational landscape (Tyka et al.,
2011 ).
However, owing to the convergence of several recent
experimental and technical developments, x-ray crystal-
lography is increasingly well-positioned to provide
insights into the connection between protein flexibilityand function. In this regard, it has been shown that crys-
tal packing in microcrystals is key to studying reaction
mechanisms by mix-and-inject serial crystallographytechnology (Olmos et al.,
2018 ; Schmidt, 2020 ). To this
end, in the study presented here, we report the crystallo-
graphic structures of the hNQO1 in its free form and in
complex with the hydride donor NADH as obtained frommicrocrystals at room temperature by serial crystallogra-
phy experiments. We have noticed that, for crystals
grown in the same crystallization conditions, the rearran-gement of the two hNQO1 homodimers in the microcrys-
tals is different to that observed in hNQO1's large crystals
(Figure
8). Although this has never been reported in the
literature, we believe that, for this case, the way we growthe microcrystals, much faster than we typically used to
grow large crystals, affects the packing of the molecules
within the crystals. Also, because of this, the catalytic siteis more accessible in microcrystals than in large crystals,
enabling the large hydride donor molecule to diffuse into
the crystals and, thus, allowing us to determine the struc-ture of the complex hNQO1-NAD
+/H.
A question that may arise from our hNQO1-NAD+/H
structure is whether the two NAD+/H molecules found
at the catalytic pockets (NAD+/HBand NAD+/HD)
reacted with the enzyme. Based on the static structures
presented in our study, it is hard to reach a conclusion.To assess whether hNQO1 protein remains enzymaticallyactive within microcrystals grown from the batch with
agitation method, the microcrystals, initially yellow due
to the presence of the oxidized FAD cofactor, turned clearimmediately upon mixing them with NADH. This color
change confirms the reduction of the enzyme by NADHGRIECO ET AL . 17 of 22

and, thus, indicates that hNQO1 is catalytically active
within crystals. Based on this finding we could assumethat the reaction has finished at least at one of the cata-
lytic sites, so the hydride transfer from NADH to FAD
has occurred. Thus, we hypothesized that at least one butprobably the two NADH molecules (NAD
+/HBand
NAD+/HD) must be NAD+and the two FAD mole-
cules FADH/C0.
4.2 |The binding of the coenzyme
NADH reduces the plasticity of hNQO1 inmicrocrystals
So far, the only structure reported on the literature (but
not deposited in PDB) of a NQO1 protein in complex
with the coenzyme was produced with the NADP+oxi-
dized form of the coenzyme (Li et al., 1995 ). NADP+is
not the NQO1's substrate but the product of the reductive
half-reaction produced after the reduced substrate,
NADPH, transfers a hydride to the enzyme FAD cofactor.With that said, the crystal structure of the complex
hNQO1-NAD
+/H reported in this study is, to the best of
our knowledge, the first structure of a natural relevantsubstrate, NADH in this case, being observed in complexwith an NQO1 enzyme's family. An overall comparative
structural analysis of the hNQO1 in the crystal structures
of the free hNQO1 with the complex hNQO1-NAD
+/H,
revealed that the binding of the hydride donor NADH
reduces the plasticity of the enzyme homodimers, as
reflected by the shrinking of the unit cell dimensions(Table
1). A more careful analysis reveals that, upon
binding of the NADH, there is a rearrangement in the
signature of the hydrogen bond interactions (in numberand length) observed at the catalytic sites between theprotein residues and the FAD molecules in the two
homodimers (Figures
5,S6andS7; Table 2). More inter-
estingly, this structural rearrangement propagates acrossthe homodimeric interfaces of the two homodimers, as
reflected by the number of inter- and intra-molecular
hydrogen bonding interactions (Figure
4; Tables S2–S13).
4.3 |New structural and dynamics
insights into the function of hNQO1
hNQO1 catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinones
to hydroquinones by a two-step redox mechanism (Anoz-Carbonell et al.,
2020 ), which has been widely studied by
multiple biophysical and biochemical techniques and has
been shown to use cooperative regulation (Anoz-Carbonell et al.,
2020 ; Clavería-Gimeno et al., 2017 ;
Pacheco-Garcia et al., 2021 ; Pey, 2018 ; Pey et al., 2014 ).Essentially, cooperativity is manifested when the binding
of a ligand to a protein alters the affinity for subsequentbinding of the same or a different ligand. In this process
a chemical or molecular signal is transmitted from one
site in a protein to another to alter its structure and/ordynamics and therefore its function. Many protein
enzymes, like hNQO1, utilize cooperative regulation to
modulate their catalytic activity by binding to a regula-tory molecule, an activator or inhibitor, that modifies
binding sites for reaction substrates. However, it remains
unclear how to decipher which local regions of a proteinstructure are conformationally coupled to each other.Therefore, the understanding of the molecular mecha-
nism of hNQO1 has been limited by the complexity of its
redox mechanism and by the difficulty in obtaining struc-tural and dynamic information on the intermediate states
by standard macromolecular crystallography.
Interestingly, the structure of the complex
hNQO1-NAD
+/H shows a molecule of the hydride donor
bound to just one of the protomers of each of the two
homodimers found in the ASU (Figure 2), which agrees
well with the negative cooperativity from studies of
hNQO1 in solution (Anoz-Carbonell et al., 2020 ; Cla-
vería-Gimeno et al., 2017 ; Pacheco-Garcia et al., 2021 ;
Pey, 2018 ; Pey et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, the two mole-
cules of the hydride donor (named NAD+/HBand
NAD+/HDin this study) have been captured in two dif-
ferent conformations.
As reported by our group recently for the free
hNQO1, the residues Tyr128 and Phe232, which gate the
pocket, swinging in and out, showed a high flexibilityand thus were modeled in various conformations
(Doppler et al.,
2023 ). In the structures presented here,
these two residues also showed a high flexibility(Figure
S5C). This observation was also made in the MD
simulations, in which more dramatic changes are partic-
ularly seen for residues Tyr128 and Phe232. In contrast to
crystal structures, the Tyr126 was also observed to behighly flexible during the simulations. It is important to
note that, these three residues, Tyr126, Ty128, and
Ph232, are strictly conserved and envisaged as keyplayers in the enzymatic function of NQO1 (Asher
et al.,
2005 ; Li et al., 1995 ; Pandey et al., 2020 ).
In addition to the structural changes observed at the
protein level, conformational changes have been
observed at the FAD level upon binding of NADH, being
these changes more relevant for the isoalloxazine ringand the ribose and adenine moieties (Figures
S9and
S10), especially in those protomers where no NAD+/H
molecules were found. In a recent study by Maestre-
Reyna et al. ( 2022 ), they reported the first structural
description of the microscopic processes of the
photoreduction of a DNA photolyase by using pump-18 of 22 GRIECO ET AL .

probe time-resolved serial crystallography at an XFEL.
DNA photolyases are flavoproteins containing, likeNQO1, an FAD molecule as cofactor. In their study, they
observed big geometric changes of the isoalloxazine moi-
ety of FAD molecule during its reduction to FADH
/C0
upon light excitation (Maestre-Reyna et al., 2022 ). In the
crystal structure of our complex hNQO1-NAD+/H,
although conformational changes have been observed forthe isoalloxazine moiety (Figure
S9), these are too subtle,
which may indicate that the reaction has simply finished.
However, similar geometric changes of the isoalloxazinehave been occasionally captured in some snapshots ofour MD simulations, even though they only account for
FAD molecules in their oxidized state (Molecular
Movies
V1andV2). So that, to investigate these changes
in the isoalloxazine experimentally, time-resolved experi-
ments at XFELs would be needed.
It is well known that computational approaches com-
plement experimental methods and provide powerful
tools to study cooperativity, with MD simulations provid-
ing dynamic details. The large number of snapshots gen-erated from MD simulations captures the motion of the
proteins, thus providing insights into the population shift
of the protein conformational ensemble. To this end, amore careful analysis of the complex of hNQO1 withNADH was carried out using MD simulations. It is
important to note that both our structural and computa-
tional results match perfectly well. In this regard, fromthis analysis we have noticed that both the FAD and the
NADH molecules are extremely dynamic even when
bound to the enzyme (Figures
7andS12–S14). Regarding
the FAD, the MD simulations show, overall, an extremely
more flexible FAD than that observed in the crystals, par-
ticularly in its AMP moiety. In the case of the NADHmolecules, they are mainly anchored to the proteinthrough its nicotinamide moiety, which stacks against
the FAD isoalloxazine in a binding pocket formed by
numerous aromatic residues (Figures
S15andS16), being
the rest of the NADH molecule highly flexible and hardly
interacting with protein residues throughout the simula-
tions (Tables S16–S18). This high plasticity of the NADH
is also reflected in our crystals and explains why the elec-
tron density surrounding the two NAD+/H molecules is
either poor or lacking, especially in the ribitol and thephosphates moieties, as well as the ribose next to the ade-
nine (Figure
3). This effect is more pronounced in the
case of the NAD+/HBmolecule.
5|CONCLUSIONS
The crystal structures reported in this study for hNQO1
are the first structures coming out from the newbeamline ID29. More importantly, both structural results
and MD simulations have supported that the two cata-lytic sites of hNQO1 act cooperatively and display highly
collective inter-domain and inter-monomer communica-
tion and dynamics. This coupled network of amino acidsis sensitive to ligand binding. In fact, the binding of
NADH significantly decreases protein dynamics and sta-
bilizes hNQO1 especially at the dimer core and interface,providing the first structural evidence that the hNQO1
functional cooperativity is driven by structural communi-
cation between the active sites through long-range propa-gation of cooperative effects across the hNQO1 proteinstructure. The flexibility and negative cooperativity of
hNQO1 seen in the room temperature structure of the
complex and the MD simulations are important featuresin obtaining a more complete picture of the function and
dynamics of this enzyme, and the approaches delineated
are critical steps needed for pursuing time-resolved crys-tallographic studies. In this sense, we are currently devel-
oping time-resolved experiments with XFELs and the
results from these experiments will be published else-where. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the
redox mechanism of hNQO1 and of its interaction with
ligands is critical to unravel its role as an antioxidant andas a potential target to treat common diseases in whichhNQO1 is involved, advancing the design of new, more
potent, and effective inhibitors that can be used in the
clinical setting.
