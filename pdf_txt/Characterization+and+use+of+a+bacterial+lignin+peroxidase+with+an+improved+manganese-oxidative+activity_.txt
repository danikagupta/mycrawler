 Abstract  
Lignin is, beside cellulose and hemicellulose, one of the three components of the 
lignocellulosic biomass. Since the peculiar phenyl -propanoic structure, lignin 
represents the first renewable source of aromatics  on Earth: the valorisation of this 
biopolymer represents a primary target of the bioeconomy and circular economy. 
The present Ph.D. thesis highlights  different biochemical strategies for lignin 
valorisation, focusing on the use of different enzymes as high -selective and efficient 
biocatalysts .  
Firstly, the N246A variant of the dye -decolorizing peroxidase DypB from 
Rhodococcus jostii  RHA1  (Rh_DypB)  and the superoxide dismutase MnSOD -1 from 
Sphingobium  sp. T2 (i.e. two bac terial lignin -degrading enzymes) were 
overexpressed in a recombinant  form in the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli  and 
biochemical characterized. In particular, for the first time, Rh_DypB was fully 
obtained as folded holoenzyme (>100 mg/L, >90% purity ) thus avoiding the need for 
a further time -consuming an d expensive reconstitution step of the apoprotein. 
Rh_DypB is a versatile biocatalyst with an improve d manganese peroxidase activity, 
show ing suitable biochemical properties for biotechnological purpo ses, such as a 
good thermostability (a melting temperature value of 63-65 °C ) and tolerance to 
compounds used in industrial solubilisation processes (i.e. Rh_DypB is active in the 
presence of 1 M N aCl, 10% DMSO, and 5% Tween -80). It allowed the oxidation o f a 
large number of lignin model compounds, the cleavage of the β -O-4 linkage in a 
lignin model dimer ( 12.5 μmol/min mg enzyme ), the decolor ization of different dyes 
(i.e. Remazol Brilliant Blue R, Azure B, Reactive Black 5) and the degradation of 
Aflatoxin B 1 into the less toxic metabolite Aflatoxin Q 1 (96% yield, 96 h).  
Interestingly, MnSOD -1 was obtained in a recombinant form with a 5 -fold increase 
in volumetric yield in comparison to reported studies (i.e. 100 mg/L vs. 19.5 mg/L), 
high activit y (518  5.3 U/mg ) and a great stability after 24 h of incubation at 
different pH values (from 3.0 to 9.0, residual activity >90%). MnSOD -1 was used, 
beside different bacterial commercial and recombinant laccases, in an extensive  
 quantitative study on the depolymerization yields of technical lignins through a bio -
catalytic approach. The use of a miniaturized colorimetric screening method for the 
identification of oxidation/degradation products from lignin allowed the set up of 
the optimal incubation conditi ons through the rapid collection and comparison of 
more than 240 results (i.e. >48 different lignin/enzyme combinations). Moreover, 
the acetone -fractionation of the technical lignins was used as mild process to 
increase the homogeneity (i.e. reduction of p olidispersity) of the starting material: 
in this way an improvement in the enzymatic degradation yield in comparison with 
the corresponding unfractionated samples was observed. Remarkably, ferulic acid 
(0.86 mg/g lignin) was obtained following  the incubati on of MnSOD -1 with the 
acetone soluble fraction of Wheat Straw Lignin (1 h, pH 8.2) and vanillin (0.35 mg/g 
lignin) was obtained from the incubation of the recombinant laccase BALL from 
Bacillus licheniformis  with the acetone soluble fraction of Kraft lign in (2 h, pH 5.0).  
Secondly , the first  synthetic multi -enzymatic pathway  for the bioconversion of 
vanillin (the only globally commercialised aromatic compound obtained from lignin 
degradation ) into the value -added product cis,cis -muconic acid  (a precursor of a 
large  number of  plastic materials ) was set up. Each of the four reaction steps was 
optimized and the economic aspects underlying the set up of the bioconversion 
were evaluated (e.g., the use of a bi -enzymatic system for the THF cofactor 
regeneration a nd the use of lyophilised  cells expressing the AroY decarboxylase in 
order to avoid the expensive reconstitution of the apoenzyme with its FMN 
cofactor). Finally, the one pot reaction was assayed in the presence of 3 mM vanillin : 
1 g of cis,cis -muconic acid was produced at the 70% of the commercial cost (>95% 
yield,  15 h). This efficient and inexpensive approach represents an improvement 
in comparison with the reported enzymatic conversion of vanillin into cis,cis -
muconic acid through a whole -cell syst em (69% yield, 48 h).

1. Introduction  
 
 
  6 1.1. Lignin  
Lignin, from the Latin wor d lignunm  which means wood, is a major component of 
cell walls in several plants and in some algae1. In the cell walls, lig nin forms cross -
links with the carbohydrates cellulose and hemicellulose, resulting in a complex 
lignocellulosic matrix (Figure 1)2,3.  
Lignin consists in an aromatic amorphous hetero -polymer with different 
physiological functions: it confers rigidity and strength to the stem and the bole of 
the higher plants, it facilita tes the transport of water and nutrients among plant 
tissues and it provides a barrier against insects and microbial attack4. It is, after  
cellulose, the second most abundant substance on E arth and, s ince its peculiar 
chemic al structure composed of phenyl propane units, it represents  the first 
renewable source of aromatics2,5. 
 
Figure 1. Simulated  structure of the lignocellulosic matrix. Cellulose  (β-1,4-glucan) consists of 
unbranched polysaccharide chains, with β -(1→4) linkages between D-glucose units. Seven microfibrills 
arrange to form a fiber (green). Hemicellulose  (yellow) includes different type of heteropolymer s which 
can contain glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose and deoxy rhamnose units. L ignin (brown)  
is a branched  amorphous polymer . Adapted by permission from Springer, Nature Revi ews Chemistry,

1.2. Chemical structure  and biosynthesis  
Lignin is a three -dimensional amorphous polymer consisting of substituted 
phenylpropane units2. It is a physically and chemically heterogeneous material, 
 7 which complex structure var ies between  species, within species and according to 
environmental factors during biosynthesis6,7. Lignin is optically inactive and it is 
formed by repeated monomeric phenylpropane units of the para-hydroxyphenyl 
(H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) types  (Figure 2A)6,8,9. Hardwood lignins  mainly  
contain  guaiacyl and syringyl units , meanwhile  p-hydroxyphenyl unit s are 
predominant in lignins from nonwoody annual fibers8. The lignin polymer is the 
result of C -O-C and C -C linkages between the monomeric units. The most 
representative type of linkage is the β-O-4, which is about the 50% of the total lignin 
interunit linkage (ca. 45% in softwoods and up to 60 -65% in hardwoods)8,10,11. Other 
common lignin interunit linkages are the resinol ( β-β), phenylcoumaran ( β-5), 5 -5’, 
α-O-4 and 4 -O-5 moieties  (Figure 2B)2,6,8.

representative linkages are indicated by arrows . Adapted  with permission from ref erence6 . Copyright

In nature, lignin is the result of three biosynthetic steps: i) sy nthesis of its 
constituents  (monolignols); ii) transfer into the cell wall; iii) final radical 
polymerization6.  
The monolignols (coniferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl alcohols) are synthetized from 
L-phenylalanine and, in the case of grasses, also from L-tyrosine9,12,13. These two 
amino acids, produced in the plastid through the shikimate pathway, are channelled 
into the phenylpro panoid pathway, yielding different hydroxy carboxylic acid s and 
 8 their activated coenzyme A  (CoA) esters. In particular, t he enzyme phenylalanine 
ammonium -lyase (PAL) catalyses the non -oxidative deamination of L-phenylalanine 
into cinnamic acid, which is th e precursor in the production of synapic, caffeic, 
ferulic, 5 -hydroxyferulic and p-coumarylic acids13. This latter compound can also be 
yielded through L-tyrosine deamination, which is catalysed by tyrosine ammonium -
lyase (TAL)13. Then, the 4 -cumarate:CoA ligase (4CL ) catalyses the activation of p-
coumaryl, ferulic and s inapic acids into CoA -thioesters, which are subsequently 
reduced by the cinna moyl-CoA reductase (CCR) and  the cinnamyl alcohol 
dehydrogenase (CAD) in to respective alcohol monolignols13.  
Monolignols are relative toxic and unstable compounds, therefore the glycosylation 
of their phenolic hydroxyl group, performed by different glucosyl -transferases, is 
essential to allow the glucoside -monolignols to be both store d in the vacuole and 
trans ferred  into the cell wall9,12. 
In the cell wall, monolignols are de -glycosylated and subsequently oxidized (i.e. 
dehydrogenated) by laccases and peroxidases  to form  phenolic radical s. Hence, the 
radical -radical  coupling between reactive monomers can occur and covalent 
carbon –carbon or carbon –oxygen (ether) bonds  are formed6,9. Since m onolignol 
radicals mainly couple at their β positions, the β -β, β-O-4, and β -5 dimers  are the 
only obtained9,14. Lignin polymer grows one unit at a time, by ad ding monomer s 
(radical s) to the existing chain according to an endwise coupling9,14. Branching 
reactions , instead,  can occur when two sequential reactions are possible at the 
growing end, i.e. the phenolic end, of the polymer14. Even though the exact 
mechanism underlying polymerization and controlling the relative abundance of 
phenylpropane unit s is still questioning,  reported  evidences support that the radical 
polymerization can not be an uncontrolled process and that the availability of 
monolignol radicals is determinant in the resulting lignin structure9,14. 
Lignin structure is intensively investigated with different analytic techniques, 
including degradative techniques (pyrolysis -gas-chromatograpy -mass 
spectrometry, thioacidolysis and derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, 
nitrobenzene oxidation) and spectroscopic ones (NMR, IR, UV and Raman  9 spectroscopy)9,15,16. Even though the firsts can be very precise in recognition of 
specific functional groups and structural moieties, being indirect methods they 
suffer of bias in deduction of the overall structure15,16. On the contrary, 
spectroscopic methods can directly elucidate lignin moieties, in a quan titative and 
high -resolving way15. In particular, the bidimen sional  [1H;13C] Heteronuclear Single 
Quantum Coherence NMR spectroscopy  (2D-HSQC NMR) has appeared to be not 
only a relatively rapid and sensitive technique (31.6 -fold more sensitive than 13C-
NMR), but also to be suitable for in situ application ( avoiding lignin separation 
processes )16. Therefore, it results the most promising for the investigation of the 
actual structural features of native lignin.  
 
1.3. Lignin biodegradation  
In land ecosystems, the degradation of lignocellulose is mandatory for carbon 
recy cling6,17. Even though the recalcitrant structure of lignin hinders its degradation, 
several types of microorganisms (mainly fungal and bacterial specie s) perform lignin 
depolymerisation through a multi -enzymatic process (Figure 3)6,17 –19.  
 
Figure 3.  Lignin biodegradation. The process involves first extracellular oxidative reactions 
(depolymerization) for the formation of low -molecular weight aromatics followed by intracellular 
metabolic bioconversion of aromatics into carbon and energy sources (mineralisation). Reprinted fr om 
reference19. Copyright 2019 with permission from Elsevier.  
 10 The main enzymes involved in lignin depolymerisation are lignin peroxidases  (LiPs), 
manganese peroxidase (MnPs), versatile peroxidase (VPs), dye -decolorizing 
peroxidases (DyPs) and laccases, but several accessory enzymes (i.e. aryl -alcohol 
oxidase, glyoxal  oxidase , aryl-alcohol dehydrogenases and quinone reductases), 
have been reported to enhance delignification6,19,20. Notably, the molecular mass of 
lignocellulolytic  extracellular  enzymes not allow them to penetrate the  intact  wood 
cell wall . Therefore, the initial steps in delignification are probably triggered by small 
chemical oxidizers  such as enzyme mediators  and reactive oxygen species6,17. 
Particularly, mediators are low molecular mass compounds which, once oxidised, 
generate stable radicals acting as electron shuttles6. Among mediators, both natural 
(e.g., 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 -hydroxyanthranilate) and synthetic (e.g., 2,2' -
azinobis 3 -ethylbenzthiazoline -6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT)       
and acid violuric acid) are known6. 
The main wood decomposing fungi are basidiomycetes,  which are distinguished into 
white -rot and brown -rot organisms according to their different ability of degrade 
lignin17. White -rot basidiomycetes (e.g., Phanerochaete chrysosporium , Trametes 
versicolor  and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora ) are the most frequent wood -rotting 
organisms and they can  both degrade lignin selectively or simultaneously with the 
degradation of hemicellulose  and cellulose17. Brown -rot fungi, instead, represent 
only the 7% of wood -rotting basidiomycetes ; they typically grow  on softwoods and 
they ca n degrade cellulose and hemicellulose only after a partial lignin 
modification17. Although only white -rot and brown -rot basidiomycetes can degrade 
wood extensively, some fungi belonging to the phyl um of Ascomycota and a number 
of bacterial strains within the class of Actinomycetes  (e.g., Streptomyces  sp., 
Rhodococcus  sp.) and Proteobacteria  (e.g., Pseudomonas sp. , Bacillus sp. ) are 
known6,21. Even though fungal degradation systems  have been more extensively 
studied comparing with bacterial metabolism, recent studies highlighted the role of 
bacteria not only in the extracellular lignin depolymerization phase but especially in 
its catabolism (lignin mineralization)4,19,21,22.   11 The possibility to employ bacterial ‘biological funneling’ to convert a heterogeneous 
mix of aromatic molecules to a single product and the ease of bacteria engineering 
increased their attractiveness for biotechnological applications4,23,24. In addition, the 
deepening in the ligninolytic pathways of different soil bacteria allowed to discover 
beside oxidative enzymes, pr omising non -radical ligninolytic ones, such as the five -
enzymatic system called Lig system from the α -proteobacterium Sphingobium  sp. 
SYK-6 which are involved in the selective cleavage of the β -aryl ether bonds6,25,26.  
 
1.4. Lignin degrading enzymes and their biotechnological 
relevance  
On the basis of their reaction mechanism, ligninolytic enzymes are classified  in 
radical -dependent and  non-radical enzymes26. The firsts, mainly comprising 
peroxidases and polyphenol oxidases (laccases), have been extensively studied over 
the past few decades  and they have been already used in several industrial 
applications6,26,27. 
 
1.4.1.  Peroxidases  
Peroxidases are enzymes belong ing to the oxidoreductases subclass which  can use 
peroxides as electron acceptors. Peroxidases from ligninolytic microorganisms are 
successfully used for biopulping and biobleaching in the paper industry27,28. In fact, 
the enzymatic delignification of w ood pulp results more effective and lignin -specific 
than the direct use of microorganisms  which, instead, causes  the degradation of 
cellulose fibers and it requires  several days of incubation27. Furthermore, 
peroxidases are involved in bio -remediation processes such as soil and water  
detoxificat ion of phenol, cresol, chlorinated phenolic compounds and recalcitrant 
xenobiotics  (e.g.,  the herbicide atrazine)27,28. Perox idase activity allows also the 
degradation of synthetic azo- and anthraquinone dyes, a characteristic  appreciated 
in the textile industry and leather treatments27,28.  12 1.4.1.1.  Lignin peroxidas e (LiP)  
Lignin peroxidase , LiP, (EC 1.11.1.14) , firstly identified in the 1980s in the white -rot 
fungus P. chrysosporium  is a glycoprotein of 38 -46 kDa  containing 1 mol of iron 
protoporphyrin IX per 1 mol of protein6,29. It catalyses the H 2O2-dependent oxidative 
depolymerization of lignin  according to the general reaction:  
1,2 - bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)propane  - 1,3 - diol + H 2O2 ↔ 
↔3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde + 1 -(3,4-dimetoxyphenyl)etan -1,2-diol + H 2O 
The first catalytic step is performed in the presence of a molecule of hydrogen 
peroxide and it consists in a two -electron oxidation of ferric [Fe(III)] LiP to 
[Fe(IV)=O+], which is a oxoferryl iron porphyrin radical cation referred as compound 
I. Subseq uently, a substrate (such as veratryl alcohol) acting as electron donor, is 
oxidised to the radical cation form. This allows first the formation of compound II 
[Fe(IV)=O] and then the restoring of the initial [Fe(III)] state through two consecutive 
one-electron reduction steps6. Notably, in the presence of an excess of hydrogen 
peroxide the compound II forms an inactive oxidation state (compound III), which 
can retu rn to the resting state both spontaneously or by reacting with a veratryl 
alcohol radical cation6. 
The LiP’s redox potential (E 0’) of about 1.2 V versus a standard  hydrogen electrode, 
at pH 3.0, enables  the enzyme to oxidise both phenolic and nonphenolic 
compounds, even in the absence of a mediator6. Nonetheless, LiPs show a n higher 
activity on monomers and phenol lignin model compounds  than on oligomers  and 
nonphenolic substrates6,30.  
 
1.4.1.2.  Manganese peroxidase (MnP)  
Manganese peroxidase, MnP, (EC 1.11.1.13) , a glycoprotein of 40 -50 kDa , is the only 
heme -peroxida se which can use a  single electron  for the  H2O2-dependent oxidation 
of Mn2+ to Mn3+, according to a mechanism for which the ferric resting state [Fe(III)]  13 is first oxidised into a radical iron cation (compound I) and  then  into an iron cation 
(compound II). The stoichiometry of the r eaction  is as follows :   
2 Mn(II) + 2H+ + H 2O2 ↔ 2 Mn(III) + 2 H 2O 
The Mn3+ dissociates from the enzyme and is chelated by carboxylic acids ( e.g.,  
oxalate, malate) forming diffusible Mn3+-complexes which act as oxidants o f 
phenolic compounds6,30. Contrary to LiP, MnP can  not o xidise  veratryl alcohol nor 
nonphenolic substrates6,30.  
 
1.4.1.3.  Versatile peroxidase (VP ) 
Versatile peroxidase, VP, (EC 1.11.1.16) is a heme -peroxidase of 35 -45 kDa firstly 
discovered in fungi belonging to the Pleurotus  and Bjerkandera  genera31. Its catalytic 
cycle is similar to that reported for LiP in which the substrate is oxidised to give  
compound I and II intermediates6. Its high redox potential (E 0’ > + 1.4 V versus SHE) 
and its several catalytic sites in the proximity of the heme poket, allow a wide 
subst rate specificity . Accordingly , VP shares with MnP the ability to oxidise Mn2+ and 
with LiP the ability to oxidise veratryl alcohol, but in both  the cases  with a lower 
affinity and efficiency6. Nonetheless, contrary to LiP and MnP, only VP o xidises 
hydroquinones and both low - and high -redox -potential dyes6,31.  
 
1.4.1.4.  Dye-decolor izing peroxidase (DyP)  
Dye-decolor izing peroxidase, DyP, (EC 1.11.1.19)  is a heme -protein belonging  to the 
peroxidase -chlorite dismutase superfamily which has protomer weight of 40 -60 kDa 
and different oligomeric states32. DyP was first identified in 1999 in the fungus 
Bjerkandera  adusta  and char acterised for its activity on azo -dyes21,32. Nevertheless, 
to date DyP-type peroxidases have been found to be more commonly expressed  in 
bacteria than fungi or other eukaryotes  and they received increased attention due 
to their involment  in lignin  degradation21,32. Based on  primary sequence , DyPs are 
classified in four classes: A -C (mainly found in bacteria) and D ( extracellular fungal  14 representatives )6,21,22,32. Even though in the different types of DyP s at most 15% of 
primary sequence identity  was apparent , structur al features (i.e. β -barrel folds and 
α-helical structural regions) and the binding pocket for hydrogen peroxide are 
conserved among subclasses33. Interestingly, a conserved aspartate was found to be 
the catalytic residue in the DyP -type peroxidases33. This is a DyP -peculiarity 
compared to th e general heme peroxidase mechanism in which a distal histidine is 
an essential acid -base catalyst33. However the details of the structure -function 
relatioships has to be further investigated in order  to better explain the catalytic 
mechanism33. DyP’s physiological  substrate has not been defined yet, but these 
enzyme s show activity on a broad range of compounds, such as synthetic dyes, 
monophenolic compounds, veratryl alcohol, carotenoids  and lignin model 
compounds6,32.  
 
1.4.2.  Laccase s 
Laccase ( EC 1.10.3.2 , benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase ) is a pol yphenol oxidase 
of about 60 kDa, belonging to the copper oxidase family6,30. The enzyme catalyses 
in the presence of ox ygen the reaction:  
4 benzen ediol + O 2 ↔ 4 benzosemiquinone + 2 H 2O   
The catalytic  site of laccase contains four copper ions  (Cu2+) of three different types : 
a type 1 copper in the T1 site (which having  an absorption maximum at the 
wavelength of  610 nm , confers to laccase the characteristic blue colour ), two type 
2 coppers in the T2 site and a type 3 copper in the T3 site6,30. The la tter form a T2/T3 
trinuclear cluster. The type 1 copper at the  T1 site represents the primary one-
electron  acceptor in the  oxidation of  the substrates6. In the first step of the catalytic 
cycle, four electrons from different substrate molecules are one by one transferred 
from T1 site to the T2/T3 trinuclea r cluster through a conserved His -Cys-His motif 
(the rate -limiting step in catalysis)6. Subsequently, the type 2 and 3 coppers are 
involved in the storage of electrons from  the reducing substrates , the binding o f  15 molecular oxygen and its four -electron reduction i nto a water molecule6,18,30.  
Because of a  moderately low redox potential s of about 0.42 - 0.79 V, the enzyme 
can direct oxidise only phenolic compounds6. The presence of suitable mediators 
(e.g.,  ABTS, 1 -hydrobenzotriazole (1 -HBT), violuric acid) expands its substrate 
spectrum to nonphenolics6,30.  
Like peroxidases, also laccase -mediated systems (LMS) are largely used in the  pulp  
and textile  industries  during pulp delignification or dye -decolorizing processes34. In 
addition, laccases are applied to eliminat e undesirable phenols and to modify  the 
colour of food or beverage in the food industry34. Other industrial fields of 
application of laccases concern the development of  nano -biosensors , new enzyme -
containing cosmetic formulations  and bio-catalysts for the  synthetic chemistry34.  
 
1.5. Valorisation of lignin from the lignocellulosic biomass  
Lignocellulosic biomass refers to plant biomass which is  composed of cellulose  (30-
50%), hemicellulose  (15-35%), lignin (10-20%) and minor amounts of fibrils and 
pectin (< 0.1%)35,36. On the basis of lignocellulose origin, it can be distinguished in 
woody feedstock’s , agri cultural residues , industrial wa stes and municipal solid 
wastes35,37. To date, because of its low cost and worldwide availability, 
lignocellulosic biomass  is considered an important  renewable feedstock  for the 
production of chemicals, materials and energy37,38. Initially , biorefineries focused on 
the development of  the so called sugar -based pla tform s, valorising the cellulosic and 
hemicellulosic components for the production of bio -fuels  and consider ing lignin as 
a raw material to be com busted35,36,39. In fact, its calorific power of 26-28 MJ/ton dry 
lignin  is comparable to that of some fossil coals8,18. Nevertheless,  energy production 
is, among the several possible applications  of lignin, the one with the lowest market 
value  (10 US$ cents/kg )8.  
In order to insert lignin  into value -added mark ets, its peculiar chemical structure has 
to be considered. In fact, it  represents  the first renewable source of aromatics and, 
after cellulos e, it is the second most abundant natural polymer on Earth2,5. The main  16 bottleneck consists in the substantial structural differences reported between 
native proto -lignin samples and technical lignins recovered after lignocellulose 
pretreatment7,40. This is a crucial point for biorefineries extensively discussed in the 
paragraph 1.5.2 . Subsequently, lignin obtained from the biomass pretreatment has 
to be depolymerised into lower -molecular -weight compounds throug h 
thermochemical or biological processes  (Figure 4)41.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Scheme of the process for lignin valorisation.  
 
Thermochemical approaches (pyrolysis, gasification and reductive, oxidative  or acid -
base catalytic depolymerisation) are performed under extreme condition s of 
temperature, pressure and pH values, eventually in the presence of metal catalysts 
(e.g., Pd, Pt, Ru, Ni, Cu)41–43. Instead, the biological approaches involve enzymes or 
microorganisms and can be performed under mild reaction conditions (see 
paragraph 1.5.3). Even though the firsts guarantee higher depolymerisati on yields 
than biological treatments, the mixture of monomeric and oligomeric  components  
obtained is generally heterogeneous and it may affect the further valorisation 
steps44: the choice of the optimal depolymeri sation option is thus closely related to 
the target end products38,42,45.

production of  biofuels ( e.g.,  pyrolytic gas  and synthesis gas  or “syngas” from the 
pyrolysis and gasification process, respectively) but also for the production of  
innovative carbon -based materials  and aromatic chemicals  (Table 1)18,38,42.

For instance, lignin can replace synthetic polymers (e.g., polyacrylonitrile) in the 
synthesis of low -cost carbon fibers38,44,45. This represents a promising high -volume 
lignin application  since, annually, the low-cost man ufacturing of  carbon fibers is 
about 300 x 103 tons45. Recently, the automotive industry has shown interest  on this 
topic: energy -efficient light -weight vehicles can be developed by replacing mostly of 
their steel parts (40 -50% of the structural steel mass) with carbon  fiber composite  18 materials38,45. Currently, the mechanical properties of the lignin -based carbon fibers 
are slightly less performing  than the petroleum -based counterpart38. For this 
purpose, pure grade lignin and the optimisation of its thermal and melting point 
properties are required44.  
Lignin is used also, as it or after chemical functionalisation, in the synthesis of other 
macromolecules , such as p olymer modifier s (fillers, additives), r esins , adhesives  and 
binders18,43 –45. In these applications, the addition of lignin during the polymer 
formulation offers the possibility to modify peculiar  properties for ex isting 
materials, by employing some intrinsic characteristics of lignin (i.e. presence of 
reactive groups)8,42, although both the molecular mass  heterogeneity of lignin and 
the difficulties in controlling its viscosity represent in some cases a technical 
challenge43,44. The development of diisocyanate adhesives in which replacing 
methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) with lignin derivatives increased their 
elasticity modulus and the  production of lignin containing resins with an increased 
in the normalized bond strength are some noteworthy examples reported in  
literature8.  
In addition, a large number of aromatic chemicals can be obtained from lignin 
depolymerisation, which are for examples the triad benzene, toluene and xylene 
(BTX), phenol, substituted coniferols , oxidized lignin monomers  (syringaldehyde , 
vanillin, vanillic  acid) and a romatic polyols . Notably, BTXs represent essential 
building blocks for the synthetic chemistry, with an annually global production 
volume from petroleum of 36, 10 and 35 x 106 tons, respectively43. The BTXs, beside 
to phenol and small amounts of C1 to C3 aliphatic and C6 -C7 cycloaliphatic 
compounds, can be produc ed from lignin after its non -selective cleavage of C -C and 
C-O bonds42–44. Although technologies f or produci ng BTXs from lignin 
depolymerisation are already available, in a commercial -scale prospective furth er 
efforts are required to improve the efficiency of the downstream of BTXs (i.e. 
deoxygenation process)38,43. The development of solutions to accelerate  the use of 
BTXs as renewable substituents in the existing synthetic processes can have a 
massive impact on society. In fact, the US Department of Energy estimated that by  19 converting into BTX the 20% of the lignin (45 million tons) originated from  the 1.3 
billion tons of biomass available in the United States, the 10% of the these 
petrochemicals  could be repl aced8,42,44.  
Among the aromatics obtainable from lignin depolym erisation, guaiacol, syringol, 
catechol , and especially vanillin and their derivatives , have attracted  particular 
relevance  for their potential as building blocks in the synthesis  of flavors, fragrances  
and polymers22,43,44. In particular, the globally vanillin market consists in about 20% 
of lignin -deriving vanillin and the resting 80% of oi l-deriving vanillin  (less than 1% is 
extracted from natural sources)38. Vanillin is one of the three lignin -deriving 
products currently commercialised  (beside dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl 
sulfoxide )38,43. Vanillin is isolated through the oxidation of  lignin in alkaline 
conditions, while dime thyl sulfide is obtained from the reaction of kraft lignin with 
molten sulfur in basic conditions  and moreover dimethyl sulfoxide  is the result of 
dimethyl sul fide oxidation  with nitrogen dioxide43. 
Finally, focusing on some properties of lignin such as its biocompatibility, 
biodegradability, antimicrobial activity and thermo -stability, its potential use for 
advanced applications in the fields of biomedicine, bior emediation  and energy 
storage have been investigated38. In particular, several studies demonstrated the 
possibility to use lignin for the production of hydrogels, nanotubes, nanowires and 
batteries, even though still at a laboratory -scale38.   
Overall, lignin valorisation is globally perceived as an urgent  topic: in the last years 
the trend in publications grew exponentially ( from 7 papers in 2008 to 108  papers  
in 2016 )42 and considering the patents filed in the last ten years in the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) contain ing the word “lignin” on the front 
page, ca. 60% were registered in the period 2016 -2020 (7,864 documents out of 
13,054 documents, data updated to March 2020). In the 2015 the global production 
of lignin was approximately 100 x 106 tons/year , valued at US$ 732.7 million but it 
is expected to reac h $913.1 million by 2025 with a compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR, i.e. the rate of return index ) of 2.2%38. The main challenges in lignin 
valorisation regard both the set -up of optimal conditions for the pretreatment  of  20 the biomass and the development of effective lignin depolymerising str ategies8,39. 
In this scenario, biotechnologies play a key role in the design of bio -catalysed 
solutions involving enzymes and microorganisms (paragraph 1.5.3)19,37,46.    
 
1.5.1.  Circular  economy   
Starting in the late 1970s, people  began to perceive the necessity of a more 
sustainable economic model , to face some of the emerging social and 
environmental problems . The constant and rapid growth of the world population, 
the effects of climate changes, the indiscriminate exploitation of soil and 
ecosystems and the strict dependence on fossil non -renewable resources led to the 
introduction of the concept  of “Bioeconomy” , which combine s profit  and strategic 
development with the  respect for society and natural resources  (Figure 5)47.  
In particular, the branch of the circular economy proposes an alternative to the 
traditional linear productive approach  by discouraging the use of virgin fossil 
sources (petroleum, coal and natural gas) and promoting a close -loop system able 
to maximise the re covery of raw materials  derived from waste s37,39,48. Although a 
single  definition is  not available, this  approach is well resumed by four key words 
(the “4Rs”) identified by the European Union, which are reuse, reduce, recycle and 
recover of waste48. A proposed definition of “waste”  is “any organic material apart 
from the primary ones ” and, in this perspective , nearly all wastes currently have 
some value ( e.g.,  lignin is used as fuel to pow er paper mills)39. Nevertheless, the aim 
of the circular economic system is to obtain higher value from waste  by realising 
integrated facilities (biorefineries) wh ich are competitive with the fossil -based 
ones37,39,47. The potential of the waste as resource is enormous, since it  annually  
represents hundreds of megatonnes (i.e., >108 t) across the world39. In particular, 
the li gnocellulosic biomass (which production is estimated to exceed 2 × 1011 t/year 
worldwide22,39) is considered the most suitable renewable feedstock  to replace 
chemicals and fuels from fossil sources37. For instance, in order to manage the  
growing concern over the global effect of greenhouse gas emission, the United  21 States funded several programs for  the increasing in biomass percentage as 
commodities from 5% in 2005 to 18% in 2020, and 25% by 203038. Moreover, the 
use of biomass as renewable source has not only important environmental effects 
but can also assure to each country independence from fossil reserves which, since 
they are  mainly  located in confined areas on Earth, they have sometimes been 
subjected to speculation and they have been causes of international conflicts38.

The circular economy model can have a positive impact both for developing 
countries (especially by addressing the waste management  crisis) and the 
developed ones50. Advantages include cost saving, job creation and innovation50. 
According to an evaluation realised by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, in the 
European Union up to 600 €billion can annually be saved by shifting toward a 
 22 circular economic model thanks to the associated  reduction in the net resources 
spending50. In addition, it claims that the shift can improve resource productivity by 
up to 3% annually, and generate an annual net benefit of 1.8 €trillion50. Nonetheless, 
one of the major barriers for the transformation of the linear economic system into 
the circular one, consists in the skills gap in the workforce49,50. Investment in 
innovation, facilities and education is both important to promote the circular 
economic model and to increase in the employment in the short term.  As for  job 
opportunit ies, the renewable energy is considered  worldwide  a driving sector . In 
2030 a slight decline in fossil fuel employment is expected to be compensated by a 
28% increase in renewable energy jobs51. In this scenario, employment remain s 
concentrated in the technologies used today , which are bioenergy, solar, 
hydropower and wind, with 9.1, 8.5, 3.8 and 2.2 million jobs respectively51.  
A concise insight on t he impact of the circular econom ic model in Europe is 
proposed in Figure 6.

Kingdom) in 2017 -2018. Data from Eurostat 2020 (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/main/home). 
In 2018, 7 billion tons of virgin  sources were consumed in Europe  (3.4% compared to 20 07). Total 
energy consumption decreased in 4% compared to 2007 (1,120 tons of oil equivalent, TOE, excluding  
supply to the processing sector  of energy and to the energy industries themselves ) and 19% of gross 
energy consumption was supplied by renewables. In 2017, 0.12% of total private investment in tangible 
goods was addressed to CE and 1.72% of the total European workers was employed in the CE sector. 
In the same year, the 11.2% of input material for domestic use was re -used ( circularity rate index ) and 
the greenhouse gas emission index was 81 (year 1990=100).

Sustainable Develo pment” released in the 2015 by the United Nations50.

Obviously, the feasibility  of the circular economic system has to consider the diverse 
characteristics of each country (i.e. type of waste produced, facilities available)  and 
both the Life Cycle Assessment  (LCA) and the Life Cycle Costing Analysis (LCCA) are 
essential tools applied for comprehensive environmental and economic 
evaluations38,47,48. There  will be no single bioeconomy, but rather  as many 
bioeconomies as there are ecosystems and socioeconomic models47. Furth ermore,  24 a deep understanding of the underlying science and engineering  is required for a 
profitable transition into a circular economic system47. 
 
1.5.2.  Pretreatments of the lignocellulosic biomass for lignin isolation  
The first step in the biomass val orisation is its fractionation into lignin, cellulose and 
hemicellulose2,8,52. The Klason meth od, the Björkman ’ and the  Brauns ’ processes , 
based on the acidic/enzymatic hydrolysis or the solvent -mediated precipitation of 
carbohydrate s, are the main routes for the isolation of native lignin  to be used for 
quantitative and structural studies42. On the other hand, the traditional routes  for 
the pretreatment of the lignocellulosic biomass aim the complete delignification of 
the lignocellulose, focusing on the total recovery of cellulose to be used in the paper 
indus try (pulping techniques) or the recovery of the fermentable polysaccharides 
for the production of biofuels52. The so called  “technical lignins ” obtained from 
these processes are by-products  largely available  on the market, mainly 
commercialized by MeadWestvaco Cooperation and Borregaard Industries20,38. The 
re-utilisation and valorisation  of technical lignins  represent an opportunity for 
modern biorefineries7,52. Nevertheless,  they differ dramatically from the 
corresponding native lignin since, during the processing, multiple reactions such as 
lignin depolymerisation, condensation of lignin fragments  and formation of new 
functional groups occur2,7,20,46. Thus, th eir non-uniform structure and the presence 
of several organic and inorganic impurities  have limited their use in high -value -
added applications53. The features of the main technical lignins are listed below  and 
resumed in Table 3.  
 
1.5.2.1.  Kraft lignin  
The kraft pulping is the prevalent chemical processing in the world , producing the 
85% of the total lignin53. The deriving kraft lignin is mostly commercialised by 
MeadWestvaco  and Metso Corporation  (developer of the LignoBoost technology for 
lignin recovery)2,52. The process is based on the reaction of the wood chips with the  25 so called white liquor, an aqueous solution of sodium h ydroxide and sodium 
sulphide, under high -temperatures conditions (155 -175 °C)46,52. The strongly 
alkaline environment of the cooking process causes the break ing of the aromatic 
ether bonds in the lignin and the formation of soluble thio -lignin fragments (black 
liquor) which can be precipitated in a condensed form upon acidification8,41. The 
molecular weight of the recovered lignin is in the range of 1,500 and 5,000 grams 
per mole53, showing  a low amount in β-O-4 ether linkages and a sulphur content of 
0.5-3.0 wt%20. In addition, a residual ash content of 1 to 5  wt% remains after the  
cooking and washing with diluted sulphuric acid  steps53. Annually , only 100,000 tons  
out of 63 × 104 tons of kraft lignin produced are valorised to obtain  carbon fibers , 
binders , ion-exchange resins,  carriers for fertilizers and pesticides and low molecular 
weight aromatics53.  
 
1.5.2.2.  Lignosul phonates  
The lignosulphonate process occurs in the presence of sulphite (HSO 3- and SO 32- 
ions) and usually either calcium or magnesium as counterions, in the pH range of 2 
to 122,53. Lignosulphonates are obtained after sulphonation, degradation and 
solubi lisation steps of native lignin . They result as water -soluble anionic 
polyelectrolytes, which sul phonation degree is estimated in 0.4 -0.5 per 
phenylpropanoid unit20,53. Lignosulphonates contain a large number of charged 
groups (phenolic hydroxyl, carboxylic and sulphur containing groups), which confer  
them unique colloidal properties46. They are thus suitable as stabilizers in colloidal 
suspensions, dispersing a gents, detergents, glues, surfactants, adhesives and 
cement additives53. Annually, around 1 million tons of lignosulphonates are 
produced as dry solids and commercialised, especiall y by Borregaard LignoTech 
(about 500,000 metric tons per year)53. 
 
 
 
  26 1.5.2.3.  Soda lignin  
Soda pulping consists in a sulphur -free process mainly used for the processing of 
annual crops (fl ax, straws, bagasse) and some hardwoods53. The cooking is carried 
out at 160 -170 °C, in the presence of sodium hydroxide and, optionally, 
anthraquinone, which acts as enhancer of th e reductive cleavage of ether bonds20,53. 
Soda lignin is highly condensed, shows a low β -O-4 ether bonds content and, in 
comparison to kraft lignin and lignosulphonates, its chemical composition is more 
similar to that of native lignin8,40,53. Since the high purity and biocompatibility of soda 
lignin, it is used in the synthesis of polymers and to produce phenolic resins and 
dispersants53.  
 
1.5.2.4.  Organosolv lignin  
In the organosolv process lignin is separated from polysaccharides via its 
solubilisation, using a cooking mixture of water and organic solvents , such as acetic 
acid, formic acid, etha nol and peroxiorganic acids2,41,53. Some of the organosolv 
processes have been commercially registered (FormicoFi b, Alcell, Acetosolv, 
Organocell and ASAM ) and scaled at the industrial level2,53. The process, usually used 
to dissolve biomass from corn, wheat, bamboo and pine wood41, allows the recovery 
of high -pure sulphur -free lignin2,40,53. Unl ike alkaline lignins and lignosulphonates, 
organosolv lignin has a low molecular weight (500 -5,000 grams per mole) and, being 
hydrophobic, it is poorly water -soluble40. In addition to the applications found for 
alkaline lignin, organosolv lignin is very attractive as filler in the formulation of inks, 
varnishes  and paints53. The main disadvantage of this process is the high cost of 
solvent recovery2.  
 
1.5.2.5.  Ionic liquid lignin  
The use of ionic liquids for the biomass processing is focused on the use of organic 
salts (e.g.,  1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, 1-butyl -3-methylimidazolium 
chloride ) which remain as liquids at relatively low temperatures  (their melting point  27 has to be lower than 100 °C)41,53,54. The process is quite promising but ha s not yet 
available on an industrial scale because of the high cost of ionic liquids41,54. In 
addition , the process highlighted different fractionation levels according to th e 
starting material53,54. For instance, for bagasse samples in the presence of 
alkylbenzenesulfonate ionic liquid , the lignin  dissolution is up to the 93%, instead 
for softwood and hardwood lignin, dissolution is only of the 26.1% and 34.9% , 
respectively53. At the end of each process, lignin is recovered by precipitation via 
addition of an antisolvent  (water, acetonitrile , acetone, dichloromethane, or a 
mixture of these ), and the ionic liquid can be recycled54. The properties of ionic 
liquid lignin  are comparable  to organosolv lignin and its field of application are 
similar to  soda  and organosolv lignins53.

1.5.3.  Biological  approaches for lignin valorisation  
The depolymerisation of lignin obtained from lignocellulosic pretreament is a 
necessary step for its valorisation  (Figure 4). Beside thermochemical depolymerising  28 approaches, the biological ones,  involving microorganisms or biocatalysts, have 
been  intensiv ely studied20,22,26. In fac t, they  can overcome the high heterogeneity of 
lignin better than traditional chemical strategies4,42. The main advantage in adopting 
biological routes consists in the lignin fragmentation through high -selective 
cleavages under reproducible and mild reaction conditions18,26. Therefore , mixtures 
enriched in the target produc t are obtained through a controlled, quite inexpensive 
and safe process (i.e. aq ueous reaction medium, moderate temperatures , absence 
in toxic chemicals, management of not hazardous  waste)26. On the other hand, 
thermochemical methods generally show higher depolymerisation yields  in shorter 
times18,42. In this view , metabolic engineering, protein engineering and hybrid 
processes which combine both chemical and biological steps, are valid solut ions to 
increase in the efficiency of biological approaches20,55.    
 
1.5.3.1.  Microorganisms : fungi and bacteria  
In nature, lignin biodegradation is a process involving different fungi and bacteria 
(paragraph 1.3). In particular, fungi belonging to the  white -rot basidiomycetes play 
e key role in lignin depolym erisation while  several ligninolytic  bacteria have shown 
to mineralise aromatics from lignin  through specific “upper” and “lower” funnelling 
pathways4,26.  
As for  white -rot fungi, difficulties related to their cultivation and the complexity of 
their biosynthetic pathway s have hampered  their biotechnological use20. 
Nevertheless, Solid State Ferme ntation (SSF) processes have been  investigated as 
environmentally and economically friendly alternative to the existing pretreatments 
of the lignocellulosic biomass22,37. This promising approach , usually followed by a 
bacterial anaerobic digestion step for th e production of biogas , is limited by the long 
incubation time required22. For instance,  using  yard trimmings (which represent a 
major part in the municipal lignocellulosic waste) , a delignification yield of 14.8 -
20.2% was obtained  after 30 days of treatment with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora , 
resul ting in the production of 34.9 -44.6 L kg-1 methane from the combined system37.  29 On the other hand, bacteria are involved  both in the biotechnological degradation 
of lignin and in its valorisation. For instance, Novosphingobium sp. B-7 was 
demonstrated to secrete extracellular manganese peroxidase s and laccase s which 
enable it to grow using kraft lignin as the sole carbon so urce56. After seven days of 
incubation, a 34.7% of lignin degradation occurred. The result is comparable to  the 
37%, 33% and 30% lignin degradation yield s reported for the bacteria Paenibacillus 
sp., Aneurinibacillus aneur inilyticus and Bacillus sp. , respectively56. Several low -
molecular aromatic products were identified, including  3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 
p-hydroxybenzoic acid and vanill ate56.   
In additi on, the investigation of the funnelling pathways in ligninolytic bacteria  
revealed their potential in the production of several value -added compounds from 
aromatics deriving from lignin degradation18,22. As general mechanism,  the “upper 
pathways” convert aromatics into few central intermediates, which are catechol 
and protocatechuate  for aerobic microorganisms , and resorcinol and phloroglucinol 
for the anaerobic ones4,18. The “lower pathways” catalyse the cleavage of the 
aromatic ring of the central intermediates  in order to provide carbon for the central 
metabolism process (e.g., citric acid cycle) for cell growth, self -maintenance and 
eventually bioproducts accumul ation  (i.e. fatty acids and polyhydroxyalkanoates  
(PHAs)  in oleaginous species )4,18. To date , bacteria (e.g., belonging to the 
Pseudomonas and the Rhodococcus gener a) have been extensively studied both  for 
the accumulation  of microbial lipids  suitable  for biodiesel production  and PHAs  
useful for the synthesis of biodegradable bioplastic , but also  for the production of  
vanillin and dicarboxylic acids  (muconate, lactate, pyruvate)18,20,57.  
For instance,  R. opacus NRRL  B-3311 was reported to accumulate 32 mg/L of lipids 
after 72h of growth on a therm ochemica lly pretreated lignin22, and  1.83 g/L lipids  
were reported for R. opacus PD630  fed-batch  fermente d in the presence of  chemo -
enzymatically pretreated lignin20.  
The PHAs are secondary metabolites produced by specialized microorganism under 
stress condition s18. As in the previous case, the yields of production are quite low: 
P. putida  growing  on lignin hydrolysate produces 250 mg/L of PHAs20, whil e for  30 Cupriavidus basilensis B-8 growing on kraft lignin the PHAs production is of 128 mg/L 
under batch condition, with an improvement up to 319.4 mg/L using a fed -batch 
fermentation18.  
Among the valuable chemicals constituting a platform for synthetic industry, the 
bioproduction of vanillin and cis,cis -muconic acid has been mainly  
investigated18,20,57. Overall, results reported for different microorganisms (i.e. 
Bacillus sp., Amycolatopsis  sp., Pediococcus  sp.) grow ing on different lignin 
feedstock show that vanillin accumulation is low er than 0.8 m g/L, with remarkable 
exceptions for bacteria growing on  lignin model compounds  (i.e. Streptomyces 
setonii produces 6.4 g/L of vanillin from ferulate)18,20,22. Notably, t he deletion of the 
gene encoding for vanillin dehydrogenase in R. jostii  RHA1 allowed the accumulation 
of vanillin up to 96 mg/L  in 144 hours , using as substrate a medium containing 2.5% 
wheat straw lignin and supplemented with 0.5% glucose18,57. Nonetheless , these 
results are far from the reported yie lds of 11 .64-13.39% lignin conversion into 
vanillin , using chemical depolymerising processes22.  
The production of muconic acid from lignin via chemical routes instead , accounts 
for the 4% in  yield, and thus, contrary to vanillin, it is not a lignin -derivi ng product 
commercialised yet22. To date, noteworthy results have been obtained  using 
bacteria as producers of the higher -value cis,cis  isomer of muconate, which is 
exploited in the synthetic production of nylon and plastic materials.  These are the  
production of 64.2 g/L cis,cis -muconate fr om catechol , 50 g/L from p-coumaric acid  
or even , 13 g/L cis,cis-muconate from a lignin hydrolysate by using three  different 
engineered strain s of P. putida , respectively20. The mutant Amycolatopsis sp. MA-2 
instead,  was reported to accumulate 85 g/L cis,cis-muconate from catechol and 1.8 
g/L cis,cis-muconate from a hydrothermally pretreated softwood lignin22. 
Beside the great opportunity in lignin valorisation represented by the exploitatio n 
of microbial metabolisms, the main d rawbacks consist in the low product titers, the 
low capability of microorganisms in using water -insoluble fraction of lignin and their 
low tolerance to  inhibitor compounds  potentially  deriving from lignin pretreatments

In this view, studies on metabolic engineering and screening of the environmentally 
biological diversity represent an efficient  strategy to identify  the ideal aromatics 
tolerant  high -accumulating domesticated microorganism to be used  in industrial 
bioreactors4,22.  
 
1.5.3.2.  Biocatalysts : ligninolytic enzymes and whole -cell systems  
The valorisation of lignin via ligninolytic enzymes and whole -cell systems  (which 
consist in “microbial factories” specifically designed using the advances in synthetic 32 biology and metabolic engineering58) aims to mimic the synergistic biocatalytic 
activities observed in nature during lignin  biodegradation46. In this view, multiple 
reaction steps are simultaneously performed in one reactor by enzymatic or by 
engineered whole -cell catalys ts46. To date, isolated enzymes and whole cells are 
both effective biocatalytic  systems industrially used , even in biorefineries (i .e. 
Accellerase® DUET  and Cellic® CTec2 commercialised by Genencor®  and 
Novozymes, respectively ) and paper pulp industry (i.e. Resinase®  commercialised  by 
Novo Nordisk ) to enhance cellulose and glycerides depolymerisation59,60.  
Overall, t he main advantage of the enzymatic catalysis  consists in its high regio -, 
chemo -, diastereo - and enantio -selectivity26,58 –60. Although pure enzyme s can work 
only under optimal pH and temperature conditions, they can also tolera te co-
solvents  used to solubilise low -water soluble substrates6,59. In addition,  they allow 
the catalysis of specific reactions, using simple equipment  and procedures59,60. 
Compared to whole cells, isolated enzymes used in one -pot reactions ensure no 
side-reactions and an increased in efficiency, since substrates have not to be 
transported across membranes58,59. Nonethe less, whole cell systems are usually 
preferred either when the isolation and purification of a certain enzyme is expensive 
or time consuming , and in multi -enzymatic  processes  (especially if the enzymes 
involved  require  co-factors recycling )58,59. Furthermore, the intracellular 
environment can protect low -stable enzymes  during catalysis59.     
In order to enhance lignin depolymerisation, several radical - and no  radical -
dependent enzymes have been biochemically characterised  and used alone or in 
multi -enzymatic reactions. For instance, the extracellular manga nese superoxide 
dismutases MnSOD -1 and MnSOD -2 from Sphingobacterium sp . T2 were the only 
dismutases identified as microbial lignin -oxidizing enzyme61. The enzymes were 
recombinant expressed in Escherichia coli , characterised and individually used for 
the depolymerisation of wheat straw Organosolv and Kraft lignin  samples  (in the 
presence of KO 2 as superoxide anion donor) resulting in the production of a number 
of aromatics (i.e. vanillin, vanillic acid, 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 2 -
methoxyhydroquinone, guaiacol)61. In this case, genome sequencing and 33 comparative alignments were fundam ental tools for  the expansion of the range of 
bacterial enzymes capable of lignin oxidation.  
Structural characterisation and mutagenesis are other important tools to enhance 
enzymatic activities, as demonstrated for the bacterial dye -decolorizi ng peroxidase 
DypB from R. jostii  RHA1 which catalytic site was successfully engineered (site -
directed mutagenesis) in order to improve its activity toward manganese (the 
apparent k cat and k cat/Km values of the enzyme for Mn2+ increased by 80 - and 15 -fold,  
respectively)62. The  DypB variant  N246A  was then demonstrated to catalyse in one 
hour the manganese mediated depolymerisation of hard wood kraft lignin and of its 
lower molecular weight solvent -extracted fractions62. Syringaldehyde and 2,6 -
dimethoxy benzoquinone were the major degradation products identified, obtained 
with yield of 18 and 21 μg /mg lignin, respectively62. 
As for the multi -enzymatic approach, five recombinant , no radical -dependent 
enzymes (Lig system) were demonstrated to catalyse in less than two  hours  the 
complete one-pot conversion of the lignin model dimer guaiac ylglycerol -β-guaiac yl 
ether (GGE) into the final products  3-hydroxy -1-(4-hydroxy -3-
methoxyphenyl)propan -1-one and guaiacol25. Therefore the system, both providing 
the cleavage of the β -O-4 linkage (which is the most abundant in lignin) and the 
regeneration of the NAD+ cofactor, represent s a valuable , inexp ensive enzymatic 
cascade for lignin valorisation25. In addition, lignin depolymerisation was achieved  
by a multi -step biocatalytic approach involving a first oxidative step catalysed by a 
laccase -mediator system followed by the selective cleavage of the β -O-4 linkages 
catalysed by β -etherases63. Also in this case, cofactor regene ration was essential to 
provide  the recycling of glutathione ; the overall process yield is of 12.5 -16% of 
OrganoCat lignin depolymerisation  and the production of 1% coniferylaldehyde63.  
Among the bio -solutions to improve lignin depolymerisation, chemo -enzymatic 
treatments combine relative -mild reaction conditions with the efficiency of the 
chemical approach . For example, up to 45% depolymerisation yields were reported 
for a combined system consisting in a mediator -laccase oxidative step performed in 
a buffered solution at pH 5.0, followed by a formic acid -induced lignin 34 depolymerisation step64. The immobilisation of laccase on superparamagnetic 
nanoparticles allows the  easy separation and reuse of the biocata lysts after 
treatment , whi le the use of the Response Surface Met hodology  (RSM) improved the 
optimisation of the incubation conditions (time of incubation, amount of 
mediator)64.  
Whole cell approach instead has been mainly used for lignin valorisation. For 
example, 0.3 g/L vanillin and 0.1 g/L vanillyl alcohol were obtai ned from eugenol 
through a two -step process. In the first step, 5 g/L ferulic acid are produced from 
eugenol by a recombinant XL1 -Blue strain of E. coli  expressing the genes encoding 
for feruloyl -CoA synthase and enoyl -CoA hydratase/aldolase form Pseudomon as sp.  
strain HR199 while , in the second step, vanillin and vanillyl alcohol are accumulated 
from ferulate20. Furthermore, up to 14.7 g/L ferulic acid were produced from 
eugenol within 30 h in a 30 -liter fermenter (93.3% molar yield) by using a XL1 -Blue 
strain of E. coli  expressing coniferyl a lcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase f rom 
Pseudomonas sp.  strain HR199 and a vanillyl alcohol oxidase from Penicillium 
simplicissimum  CBS 170.9020. 
In addition, the DH1 strain of E. coli was successfully engineered with the cis,cis -
muconate anabolic pathway, by co -transformation and co -expression of genes from 
different  natural  producers (e.g. , belonging to the genera Klebsiella, Sphingobium, 
Pseudomonas )65. The engineered strain produced up to 314 mg /L cis,cis -muconate 
from vanillin (deriving from a thermochemically pretreated Kraft lignin ), 
corresponding to 0.69 g ccMA/gvanillin65. 
Enzymes  and whole -cell systems  are thus promising approaches for the 
biotechnological valorisation of lignin  (Table 4)20,46. Catalysts from different source s 
can be combined to reach synergistic results and, in some cases, in order to reduce 
costs they can  even  be immobilised on specific supports  and be re -used20,58,59. 
Contrary to the microbial approach (paragraph 1.5.3.1)  catalysts show higher 
delignification rate, a wider tolerance to temperature and pH range s and they do 
not consume sugar nor require  nutrient supplementation37,58,59. Furthermore , 35 molecular and synthetic biology provide powerful  tools (i.e. directed evolution , DNA 
shuffling, random mutagenesis) for even improve natural enzym atic or metabolic 
features (i.e. enzymatic thermostability  or activity , fatty acid composition of the 
cellular membrane ) to biotechnological purposes59. In this view, the deep in the 
investigation of the  microbial metabolic diversity (e.g., e xtremophiles ) is 
fundamental and it will allow to design specific biocatalysts, such as de novo  
pathways for whole cell systems58,59.  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Aim of the work  
 
 37 Lignin is, beside cellulose and hemicellulose, one of the three component s of the 
lignocellulosic biomass. It is, after cellulose, the second most abundant substance 
on Earth and, since its peculiar chemical composition arising from  para -
hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl and syringyl  units, it represents the first renewable source 
of arom atics . Nevertheless, the obtainment of value -added aromatic molecules 
through its degradation is mainly hindered by the high stability and recalcitrance of 
its structure. Therefore, in the past this biopolymer was underutilised and it was 
mainly burned for  power generation, since its calorific power of 26-28 MJ/ton dry 
lignin  is comparable to that of some fossil coals.  
The current and traditional linear material and energy flow model, which is mainly 
based on the  exploitation of virgin sources (such as the  fossil ones) according to the 
principle of “extract, produce , use, dump ” is unsustainable and therefore it has to 
be integrated with the strategic and eco -friendly development model described by 
the bioeconomy and the circular economy paradigms.  
In this scenario, the valorisation of lignin is a main biotechnological challenge which 
aims to  perform its degradation by biological approaches  in order to obtain value -
added aromatics to be used as building blocks for synthetic pathways.  
 
This Ph.D. project is aimed to explore different biochemical strategies for lignin 
valorisation, focusing on the use of different enzymes  as high -selective and efficient 
biocatalysts  able to perform either single -catalysed reactions or to act synergistically 
in multi -enzymatic reactions.   
The enzymatic tool -box containing 26 ligninolytic and auxiliary -ligninolytic activities, 
which is available at the host laboratory “The Protein Factory 2.0”, will be added of 
two bacterial enzymes (i.e. the N246A variant of the dye -decolorizin g peroxidase 
DypB from Rhodococcus jostii  RHA1 and the superoxide dismutase MnSOD -1 from 
Sphingobium sp.  T2) recently reported to be involved in lignin degradation. In order 
to investigate their potential and versatility as biocatalysts, these two enzymes will 
be expressed in recombinant form, isolated and biochemically characterised.  38 Moreover, the project i s aimed to elucidate the composition of degradation 
products, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, from different technical lignin 
samples enzymatically treated. Actually, enzymes can perform selective reactions 
resulting in the driven production of  specific products of interest. Accordingly, a 
rapid miniaturised screening method for the identification of the optimal 
lignin/enzyme incubation conditions will be used in the design of the multi -variant 
experiments. In order to overcome the main bottlene ck in the scaled -up application 
of biocatalysis for lignin degradation, the degradation yields will be investigated 
through a solvent -based fractionation of the starting material.  
Finally, since vanillin is the only globally commercialised aromatic obtain ed from 
lignin degradation, a synthetic multi -enzymatic pathway for its valorisation into 
cis,cis -muconic acid, the precursor in the synthesis of nylon and of a large number 
of plastic materials, will be investigated. The one -pot bioconversion of vanillin will 
be set -up in the presence of different enzymatic activities working synergistically.   3. Results

Enzymatic oxidative valorization of technical lignins and their 
fractions : a quantitative approach   
 
Introduction  
Lignin is an optically inactive three -dimensional aromatic polymer constituted 
of substituted phenylpropane units (Berlin and Balakshin , 2014;  Ponnusamy  
et al., 2019 ) and it represents the first renewable source of aromatics on Earth . 
Therefore , strategies  to obtain high value -added aromatic compounds from its 
degradation are constantly studied and improved ( Zakzeski et al., 2010 ; 
Schutyser  et al. 2018; Banu et al., 2019 ; Ponnusamy  et al., 2019 ). The thermo -
chemical approaches to perform lignin depolymerisa tion, based on the use of  
inorganic catalysts (e.g. metals) and extreme incubation conditions in terms of 
pH and temperatures, allowed the almost complete depolymerisation of 
various lignin samples, but with the formation of complex and heterogeneous 
mixtu res of degradation products (Beckham et al., 2016 ; Schutyser  et al. 
2018 ). On the other hand, the biological approaches are based on the use of 
microbial cells and enzymes. Bacterial degradation of kraft lignin generated 
several aromatic lignin -related compounds, e.g. guaiacol, acetoguaiacone, 
gallic acid and ferulic acid from treatment with Aneurinibacillus 
aneuriniltycus  and 3,4,5 -trimethoxybenz aldeyde and ferulic acid from 
Bacillus  sp. (Raj et al., 2007),  ethanediol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid and vanillic 
acid from Novosphingobium  sp. B -7 (Chen et al., 2012). As  a general rule, the 
produced amount of aromatics was low, frequently avoiding a quantifi cation. 
For recent reviews on microbial degradation of lignins see ( Asina et al., 2017 ; 
Becker and Wittman, 2019 ). On the other hand, enzymes (e.g. , laccases and 
peroxidases) act under mild reaction conditions and allow high ly selective and 
specific cleava ges of the lignin polymer ( Lancefield  et al., 2016; Pollegioni et 
al., 2016 ; Rosini et al., 2016; Chen and Wan, 2017; Picart et al., 2017; Zhu et 58 al., 2020 ). The limit in the use of biological approaches mainly concerns the 
lower  depolymerisation yields than the chemical ones, which are comprised 
between the 65% under specific acidic treatments up to the complete 
mineralisation in the case of pyrolytic and gasification treatments (Beckham 
et al., 2016; Agarwal et al., 2018 ; Schutyser  et al., 2018 ). In thi s view, the 
identification of the optimal experimental conditions (i.e. amount of enzyme, 
incubation time, temperature, pH, …) is fundamental to improve the 
degradation yields.  During the years various works reported the main 
molecules released from lignin  samples following enzymatic treatments 
(Rashid et al., 2015; Lancefield et al., 2016 ), but frequently only a qualitative 
analysis was reported. Quantitative analyses reported a ≈ 12.5% (w/w) oily 
fraction of low -molecular weight compounds (Wiermans et al. , 2013; Picart 
et al., 2017 ) or < 0.5 mg/g lignin for selected molecules (Reiter et al., 2013; 
Singh et al., 2013).  
The aim of the present work consists in a quantitative comparison of the 
degradation products obtained from enzymatic  treatments using four oxidative 
activities on  three technical lignins (i.e. softwood lignosul fonate, softwood 
kraft lignin and wheat straw lignin)  following the identification of optimized 
conditions . Firstly, more than 4 8 enzyme /lignin combinations were analysed 
at different t imes through a rapid , miniaturised colorimetric screening method 
(Tonin et al., 2017). Then , the optimal identified conditions were assayed in a 
scaled -up treatment, and the obtained products were extracted with ethyl 
acetate and quantified by GC -MS analys is. In addition, with the purpose of 
better identifying the efficacy of the treatment on the various lignin 
constituents, both kraft and wheat straw organosolv lignin were subjected to 
an acetone -aided fractionation prior to the depolymerisation step. The high 
heterogenicity of the lignin structure is well -known, and solvent fractionation 
represents a simple and quick approach to achieve more homogenous cuts 
(Gigli and Crestini, 2020 ). The obtained results provided , for the first time , a 59 deep investigation not only of the main  degradation products  from enzymatic 
treatment of lignins , but especially of their abundance.  
 
Materials and Methods  
1. Reagents and enzymes  
Softwood Kraft Lignin (SKL), Wheat Straw Lignin (WSL) and Softwood 
Lignosul fonate (SLS) were kindly provided by Stora Enso (Helsinki, Finland), 
Compagnie Industrielle de la Matière Végétale ( CIMV, Paris, France) and 
Borregaard (Sarpsborg, Norway), respectively, and used as received.  The 
laccase from Bacillus licheniformis (BALL) and the manganese superoxide 
dismutase from Sphingobacterium spiritivorum  T2 (MnSOD -1) recombinant 
enzyme s were  expressed and purified as reported in (Tonin et al., 2016 ) and 
in the Supplementary Materials (see Figures S1 -S5 for MnSOD -1 
characterization).  The laccase from Funalia trogii  (Lac F) was provided by 
ASA Spezialenzyme GmbH. The laccase from Trametes versicolor  (Lac C), 
2,2,6,6 -tetramethylpiperidine 1 -oxyl (TEMPO), 2,2′ -azino -bis(3 -
ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), 1 -
hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), N-hydroxyphthalimide (HPI), violuric acid 
(VA), 2,4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4 -DNP), 1,2,3 -trihydroxybenzene 
(pyrogallol), 3,4 -dimethoxybenzyl alcohol and ethyl acetate (ACS grade) 
were purchased from Merck (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,  Germany).  
 
2. Enzymatic assays  
Enzymatic activities were assayed at 25 °C with a thermostated Jasco V -580 
spectrophotometer (Jasco, Cremella, Italy) as follows. The laccase activity 
was determined by monitoring the oxidation of 0.5 mM ABTS (ε 420 nm  = 36 
mM−1 cm−1) at 420 nm in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (Tonin et al., 2016 ). 
One enzymatic unit is defined as the amount of enzyme which converts 1 µmol 
of substrate per min.  60 The superoxide dismutase activity of MnSOD -1 was determined using the 
autoxidation p yrogallol assay by monitoring the change of absorbance at 325 
nm of the pyrogallol, for 5 min, at 25 °C (He et al., 2007; Li, 2012) . The assay 
was performed in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.2, 0.1 mM EDTA buffer using 0.25 
mM pyrogallol (100 mM stock dissolved in 10 mM HCl). One enzymatic unit 
is defined as the amount of enzyme that inhibits the autoxidation rate of 
pyrogallol by 50%  (Marklund and Marklund, 1974 ).  
 
3. Lignin samples: fractionation methods and structural 
characterization  
Acetone soluble (AS) and acetone insoluble (AI) fractions were prepared by 
suspending SKL and WSL powders (at a concentration of 5 mg/mL) in 
acetone and letting them dissolve at 23  °C under mild stirring for 12 hours. 
The AI fraction  was collected by filtr ation and dried under vacuum at 30  °C, 
while the AS fraction was recovered by solvent removal in a rotavapor at 30  
°C. Four samples, acetone soluble kraft lignin (ASKL, 68.7%), acetone 
insoluble kraft lignin (AIKL 31.3%), acetone soluble wheat straw lignin  
(ASWL, 75.0%) and acetone insoluble wheat straw lignin (AIWL, 25.0%) 
were thus obtained with the indicated yields.  
Quantitative 31P NMR analysis was performed on lignin samples in 
accordance with a previously described procedure  (Meng  et al., 2019 ). Brief ly, 
a weighed amount of sample (30 mg) was dissolved in a pyridine/CDCl3 1.6:1 
mixture phosphitylated by reaction with Cl -TMDP. Cholesterol was used as 
internal standard. The spectra were recorded by collecting at least 256 scans 
on a 300 MHz Bruker instru ment.  
GPC was carried out on a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped  with a Plgel 
MiniMIX -C column. HPLC -grade DMSO containing 0.1% lithium chloride 
was employed as eluent (0.2 mL/min, 70  °C). Standard calibration was 61 performed with polysty rene sulfonate standard s (Merck , Mw range 4.3 –2600 
kDa) and lignin low -molecular weight models (170 –941 Da).  
 
4. Enzymatic treatment of unfractionated lignins: screening and scale 
up 
The optimal incubation conditions for the oxidation/degradation of technical 
lignins ( SKL, WSL, and  SLS) were identified using a rapid, miniaturising 
colorimetric screening as previously reported by (Tonin et al., 2017) . In 
particular, lignin samples were dissolved at 50 mg/mL in 50 mM sodium 
acetate, pH 5.0, with the addition of 20% DMSO in the case of  WSL  sample s. 
In details, 0.5 mg lignin were incubated with Lac C, Lac F or BALL (0.2 U/mg 
lignin) enzymes in the presence of 2 mM mediator (i.e. ABTS, TEMPO, HBT, 
HPI or violuric acid) in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (1 mL final volume). 
The WSL (4.5 mg) was incubated with MnSOD -1 enzyme (1 U/mg lignin) in 
the presence of 1 mM pyrogallol,  in 50 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.2, 0.1 mM EDTA . 
In parallel, control reactions in the absence of enzyme were carried out. All 
samples were incubated at 30 °C on a rotary wheel: 2 0 μL of sample were 
withdrawn at different times (15 min, 2, 5, 24, 30, 48 h) and added of 30 μL 
of 0.1 N HCl to be analysed in a 96 -well microtiter plate with the colorimetric 
screening procedure. In detail s, after 5 min of incubation at 25 °C with 50 μL 
of 1 mM 2,4 -DNP (dissolved in 0.1 N HCl) , the color was generate d by adding 
0.1 mL of 1 N NaOH: the absorbance value at 450 nm was measured with a 
microtiter plate reader (Sunrise, Tecan, Italy). The steps for the microplate 
setting up were performed using  the automated system epMotion 5075 
(Eppendorf, Italy). Each sample was analysed in duplicate.  
On the basis of the screening results, the  optimal combinations of lignin  and 
enzyme  (i.e. SLS/Lac C/TEMPO, WLS /Lac F/ABTS , SKL /BALL/TEMPO , 
and WLS/MnSOD -1) wer e scaled up to be analysed in GC -MS. In details: a)  
40 U laccase (0.2 U laccase/mg lignin) and 2 mM mediator in 50 mM sodium 62 acetate, pH 5.0 , were incubated  in a 0.3 L baffled flask containing ligni n (5 
mg/mL final concentration); b) 0.2 g of WSL, and 0.1 g of AIWL or ASWL 
were incubated in a 0.5 L baffled flask (1 mg/mL final concentration) with 
700 U MnSOD -1 (3.5 U enzyme/mg lignin) in 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.2, 1 mM 
EDTA; c)  control reactions in the absence of enzyme. Samples were incubated 
for 24 h (1 h for WLS/MnSOD -1 enzyme/lignin combination) at 30 °C under 
100 rpm  shaking .  
 
5. Enzymatic treatment of lignin fractions  
ASKL, AIKL, ASWL and AIWL lignin fractions were prepared at 40 mg/mL 
by adding 0.5 mL 1 N NaOH to the dried powder and bringing to volume with 
the appropriate buffer.  
The ASKL and AIKL  (0.1 g, 20 mL, 5 mg/mL) , and the ASWL and AIWL  
samples (0.2 g, 40 mL, 5 mg/mL) were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C under 
shaking (100 rpm) in 0. 3 L baffled flasks in the presence of BALL laccase and 
2 mM TE MPO mediator, and Lac F laccase  and 2 mM ABTS mediator  (0.2 U 
enzyme/mg lignin), respectively,  in 50 m M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. To 
avoid repolymerization, 2 -hours reaction time was used . Furthermore, t he 
ASWL and AIWL (0.1 g, 100 mL, 1 mg/mL) were also incubated in 0.5 L 
baffled flasks in the presence of 1 mM pyrogallol and 414 U MnSOD -1 (4.14 
U/mg lignin) in 50 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.2, 1 mM EDTA. Samples were 
incubated for 1 h at 30 °C under a 100 rpm shaking. For all the enzymatic 
treatments of lignin fractions, reaction controls in the absence of the enzyme 
were carried out.  
 
6. Solvent extraction and GC -MS analyses  
At the end of the incubation, the pH was adjusted to 1.0  by adding 1 N HCl. 
Subsequently , 1 and 10 mg of 3,4 -dimethoxybenzyl alcohol as internal 
standard  (IS) were added to the fractionated and unfractionated lignin 63 samples, respectively. The extraction of the acidified samples was carried out 
using ethyl acetate as aprotic solvent in a 3:1 (v/v) ratio. The organic phase 
was collected, dew atered over anhydrous Na 2SO 4, filtered through Whatman 
filter paper and dried in a rotary evaporator.  
Mass spectrometric analyses of the lignin extracts were performed on acetone -
dissolved samples (0.1 mg/mL) before and after in situ  silylation using N,O -
bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide in the presence of dry pyridine. Gas 
chromatographic separation of the samples was accomplished using a 
Shimadzu GCMS QP2010 Ultra system (gas chromatograph GC2010 Plus, 
equipped with Shimadzu autosampler AOC20i) at 70  eV ionization energy. A 
Supelco fused -silica capillary column SLB -5 ms (30 m long, 0.25 mm thick, 
0.25 μm diameter) was used as stationary phase, He (UHP grade) as mobile 
phase . The system was operated in “linear velocity mode” with a starting 
pressure of 100 kPa, 280 °C injection temperature, and 200 °C interface 
temperature, running the following temperature program: 50 °C start 
temperature for 1 min, 10 °C min–1 heating rate, 28 0 °C final temperature for 
15 min. System control and analyses were carried out on a  Shimadzu analysis 
software package Labsolutions –GCMSsolution Version 2.61.   
The amount of each compound  (mP) extract ed in the organic phase has been 
quantified as follows : 
mP = A P/AIS × m IS × rfIS  (1) 
where m IS is the mass of the internal standard added, A P and A IS are the peak 
areas of the product and of the internal standard, respectively, and rfIS, equal 
to 0.791, is the fraction of the IS retained in the organic phase  after the 
extraction step.  
 
 
 
 64 Results and discussion  
1. Structural characterisation of lignin samples  
The number -average molecular weight (M n) and the polydispersity index (PDI 
= M W/Mn) of the unfractionated and fractionated lignins, determined by GPC, 
are shown in Table 1. The PDI of the pristine lignins (i.e. SKL, WSL, and 
SLS) is fairly large, confirming the heterogeneous nature of this material 
(Table 1). On the other hand, the fractions highlight a lowering of the PDI 
with respect to the pristine lignin s, indicating that more homogeneous cuts 
were obtained,  in agreement with literature reports (Gigli and Crestini, 2020).  
By comparing the two fractions of kraft lignin, it can be noticed that AIKL 
and ASKL display quite different characteristics. Specific ally, AIKL shows a 
higher molecular weight and content of aliphatic OH groups and a lower 
concentration of phenolic OH functionalities with respect to ASKL (Table 1), 
being constituted of polymeric and less degraded lignin fragments containing 
aliphatic si de chains. On the other hand, ASKL mainly contains highly 
branched oligomeric structures. (Crestini et al. 2017)

PDI: polydispersity index; determined by: a) quantitative 31P NMR spectroscopy; b) gel 
permeation chromatography in DMSO.  
 65 A similar trend was observed for WSL and its fractions. Specifically, AIWL 
shows a higher molecular weight than the unfractionated lignin and a still 
broad polydispersity, as already described (Lange et al., 2016). Conversely, 
the M n of ASWL, which also di splays a consistent reduction of the PDI as 
compared to both WSL and AIWL, is the lowest among the wheat straw -based 
samples. As observed in the case of kraft lignin, the higher concentration of 
aliphatic groups has been determined in the AIWL.  
Lastly, SLS  contains a low amount of OH groups, which is mainly due to the 
very low concentration of aliphatic hydroxyl groups as compared to the other 
lignins here characterized. In addition, a total content of sulphur equal to 6.3% 
was determined by elemental analy sis.  
 
2. Enzymatic treatments  
2.1. Screening for optimal lignin/ enzyme  combinations  
A rapid colorimetric screening method based on the selective reaction under 
basic conditions of 2,4 -DNP with carbonyl groups was used to analyse the 
formation of oxidative degradation products after the incubation (30 °C) of 
technical SLS, WSL  and SKL  by L ac C, Lac F , BALL , and MnSOD -1 
enzymes  (Tonin et al., 201 7). Samples were analyzed a t different times (15 
min, 2, 5, 24, 30, 48 h) and the recorded  absorbance value at 450 nm was 
corrected by the absorption value of the respective control (incubation witho ut 
enzyme). In this way, more than 4 8 different lignin/ enzyme  combinations 
were assayed, with more than 2 40 data collected . For the lignosul fonate  (SLS) , 
the absorbance maximum was observed after 24 h of incubation with Lac C 
and TEMPO (Figure 1 A). The max imum absorbance responses for WSL  were 
observed after 24 h of incubation with Lac C, Lac F and BALL laccases in the 
presence of ABTS (Figure 1 B). Interestingly, the earlier significant increase 
in the absorbance at 450 nm was observed after 2 h of incubation of SKL with 
Lac F/TEMPO , but the maximal absorbance was reached with BALL/TEMPO 66 after 24 h (Figure 1 C). Based on previous studies (Rashid et al ., 2015; 
Lancefield et al., 2016),  the treatment with MnSOD -1 was focused on wheat 
straw organosolv only. The best response for WSL was obtained after 1 h of 
incubation with MnSOD -1 (Figure S6) . Since the absorbance at 450 nm is 
proportional to the carbony l groups deriving from the oxidative lignin 
degradation (Tonin et al., 201 7), the screening identified SLS/Lac C/TEMPO, 
WSL /Lac F /ABTS , SKL /BALL/TEMPO , and WLS/MnSOD -1 as the optimal 
combinations for the enzymatic oxidation/degradation of unfractionated 
lignins to be scaled up for GC -MS analyses.

67 2.2. Treatment of WSL and its fractions with Lac F /ABTS  or MnSOD -1  
WSL  was incubated with Lac F and 2 mM ABTS , as well as with the MnSOD -
1 enzyme . At the end of the incubation, follow ed by  acidification to pH ≈ 1.0 
and extraction with ethyl acetate, the oxidation products were analysed by GC-
MS. Table 2 reports the amount  (mg) of each product generated per gram of 
lignin, subtracted of the quantity measured in the control (without the 
enzyme). The results suggest that both enzymes cleave the lignin interunit 
bonds and promote the depolymerisation of branched chains, leadin g to the 
production of various aromatic compounds and, in a fewer cases, also to short 
chain aliphatic fragments.

Lignin fractionation permitted to increase the amount of extracted products 
with respect to the pristine material (Figure 2).  
 
 
Figure 2.  Total extracted products (mg/g of lignin) obtained after the enzymatic treatment. 
The values, quantified by GC -MS, are reported as net production, i.e. subtracted of the 
corresponding amounts present in the control without enzyme.  
 
Furthermore, the colle cted data indicate a higher yield of total monomers 
produced in the lignin samples treated with LacF/ABTS with respect to those 
incubated in the presence of the MnSOD -1 enzyme. However, beside A IWL 
treated with LacF/ABTS, for which a production of almost 2 3 mg of low 
69 molecular weight compounds per gram of lignin has been measured, all other 
samples do not significantly differ in terms of total extracted species, being in 
the range 1 -2 mg/g (Figure 2). Conversely, the variety and the structure of the 
molecul es generated by the two enzymes are quite different from sample to 
sample. A total of 13 different monoaromatics and 5 substituted biphenyls 
have been identified by quantitative analysis (Table 2). Interestingly, in the 
WSL treated with LacF/ABTS a very lo w amount of glycerol (about 0.06 mg/g 
of lignin) has been also detected.  A wider number of compounds was apparent 
in the AIWL with respect to the WSL, irrespectively of the enzyme used for 
the oxidation. By calculating the relative content of each molecule  extracted 
in the organic phase (Figure 3), it can be noticed that in the case of the 
LacF/ABTS system veratraldehyde, veratric acid and 2,6 -
dimethoxybenzoquinone are present in higher concentration in all samples.  
 
 
Figure 3.  Relative content (%) of each product in the mixture of extracts after the treatment 
of WSL, ASWL and AIWL with the LacF/ABTS (A) and Mn -SOD -1 (B) enzymatic systems. 
Yields have been calculated in terms of net production, i.e. subtracted of the correspondi ng 
amounts present in the control without enzyme.  
 
On the other hand, ferulic acid, and to a minor extent also coniferyl alcohol 
and p-coumaric acid, are the primary products when the oxidation treatment 
70 is carried out on WSL, ASWL and AIWL in the presenc e of MnSOD -1. These 
molecules have not been detected in the lignin extracts treated with the Lac 
F/ABTS systems. It has been reported that a significant portion of the WSL 
aliphatic primary alcohols are esterified with coumaric and ferulic acid 
derivatives  (Lange et al., 2016). Therefore, the presence of these molecules in 
the extracts of WSL, AIWL and ASWL treated with MnSOD -1 system 
indicates the ability of superoxide dismutase to cleave these end motifs, while 
laccase does not.  
It can thus be concluded t hat MnSOD -1 mainly causes the formation of 
phenylpropanoid units (monolignols) with various degrees of oxidation, while 
by using the Lac F system phenolic moieties arising from Cα -Cβ cleavage 
(e.g., veratraldehyde and veratric acid) and from aryl -Cα cleava ge (2,6-
dimethoxybenzoquinone ) are mostly extracted. Both enzymes did not lead to 
a complete oxidation of the depolymerised molecules, as in both cases either 
alcohols, aldehydes or acids were found. Additionally, it can be pointed out 
that the substituted  biphenyls are mostly constituted of 5 -5’ motifs or dimeric 
species deriving from ether -containing moieties, such in the case of 4,4’-
dimethoxy -2,2'-dihydroxychalcone  and d iveratryl ether . 
The silylation supported the above discussed data although, as expected, 
additional compounds have been identified (Table S1). A total of 19 
monoaromatic species, five biphenyls and two C3 alkyl chains have been 
distinguished, all ascribable to depolymerisation of the lignin chains. The 
trend observed in the quantitat ive analysis was confirmed, as unfractionated 
lignin displayed a lower variety of molecules, while a broader number of 
compounds have been extracted from the fractions (both ASWL and AIWL).  
 
2.3. Treatment of SKL and its fractions  with BALL /TEMPO  
Based on prel iminary results (Section 2.1), SKL and its fractions were  
incubated with BALL  and 2 mM TEMPO  at 30 °C for 24 h. The GC-MS 71 analyses  of the extracted samples highlighted the presence of a number of 
oxidative products as compared with the corresponding contro ls, confirming 
the effectiveness of the laccase treatment. Moreover, it demonstrated that the 
yield of total extracted compounds,  in the range  0.4 – 3.5 mg/g of lignin , 
depend s on the starting materials, i.e. SKL, ASKL and AIKL  (Figure 2) . A 
total of 9 different compounds, whose structure arises from enzyme -mediated 
oxidative depolymerization of lignin backbone have been identified  (Table 3) . 
Five of them, i.e. apocynin, 4-ethoxy -3-methoxy -benzaldehyde , isoeugenol , 
vanillin  and veratraldehyde are monomer ic phenols with various substituents 
and degree of oxidation, while the other four are substituted biphenyls. 
Interestingly, no carboxylic acid  were quantified in concentration higher than 
the control, although the presence of 5-methoxy -2-benzoic acid , van illic acid, 
and 3 -phenyl -2-propenoic acid and of one alkyl species, i.e. 2 -propanoic acid, 
was detected after silylation (Table S2).

SKL, ASKL and AIK L with BALL /TEMPO  and of SLS with L ac C/TEMPO .

Secoisolariciresinol    0.590      72 The fractionation not only allowed for the extraction of a wider variety of 
compounds, but also for an increase in the monomer production with respect 
to the pristine lignin. As a proof of evidence, the incubation of ASKL and 
AIKL with BALL/TEMPO respectively produced up to 0.9 mg/g and 2.1 mg/g 
of veratraldehyde , and  2.4 mg/g and 0. 35 mg/g of apocynin , while from the 
unfractionated lignin much smaller amounts of veratraldehyde (0.05 mg/g)  
were recovered. The formation of a pocynin was not observed. Interestingly, a 
significant concentration of diveratryl ether, probably deriving from the 
recombination of two disubstituted benzyl alcohol units, has been found in the 
extracts of treated SKL lignin (Figure 4). Conversely, this molecule was not 
identified after the enzymatic oxidative process car ried out on the fractions.

the control without enzyme.  
 
2.4. Treatment of softwood lignosul fonate with Lac C /TEMPO  
SLS was incubated with Lac C and 2 mM TEMPO . Afterwards,  the treated 
sample (and the corresponding control in the absence of the enzyme) was 
acidified to pH ≈ 1.0, extracted with ethyl acetate and analysed by GC-MS. 
73 The results show the production of the solely veratraldehyde , for which 0.174 
mg/g were obtained in the organic phase , with a higher concentration than the 
control  (Table 3) . After silylation, also the reduced  form of this compound, 
i.e. veratryl alcohol, was detected, a compound presen t in the control  too. 
Interestingly, no sulphur -containing species have been extracted in the organic 
phase. This could be either due to the high water solubility of c ompounds 
bearing sulfonic acid moieties or to the inability of the laccase system in 
depolymerizing such motifs.  
The total quantity of extracts is significantly lower in comparison to these 
figures achieved by the oxidative depolymerisation of kraft and or ganosolv 
lignins (in agreement with the few available literature about enzymatic 
treatments of lignosulfonates); on the other hand, a much higher selectivity 
was achieved as only veratryl alcohol -based species have been recovered from 
the reaction mixture.   
 
Conclusions  
A primary objective of bio -economy is to develop bio -based products , able to 
compete with their existing petroleum -based counterparts . Lignin 
depolymerisation , through selective and specific enzymatic treatments,  is a 
key aspect in the biotechnological valorisation of this biopolymer (Pollegioni 
et al., 2015; Tonin et al., 2016). “You can make anything you want out of 
lignin” is a frequently heard statement in the scientific community or industry . 
In the present w ork, the technical softwood kraft lignin  (SKL), wheat straw 
lignin (WSL) and softwood lignosulfonate (SLS) were  incubated with 
different enzymes and t he accumulation of oxidative/degradation products in 
each sample was monitored through a colorimetric screening (Tonin et al., 
2017). By examining more than 2 40 experimental conditions, those resulting 
in the maximum intensity  of absorbance at 450 nm for t he three unfractionated 
lignin samples  were chosen:  SLS/Lac C/TEMPO, WSL /Lac F/ABTS , 74 SKL /BALL/TEMPO laccase/mediator system s (24 h of incubation) and 
WSL/MnSOD -1 (1 h of incubation ). On this  basis, the optimal enzyme/ lignin  
combination s were scaled -up. The  highest yield  in terms of products extracted 
in the organic phase , calculated by subtracting  the amount present in the 
corresponding untreated control , was obtained for the unfractionated and 
fractionated wheat straw lignin treated with the Lac F/ABTS laccase/mediator 
system  (22.8 mg total monomers per gram of lignin), with veratr aldehyde  as 
the main degradation product ( 13 mg/g , Table 2). The lowest degree of 
depolymerisation was obtained in the case of lignosulfonate: only 0.17 mg/g 
of products were reco vered. However, the enzymatic treatment on this sample 
displayed the highest selectivity among the tested materials, as the only 
detected product was veratraldehyde.   
The amounts of recovered high -added value compounds also favourably 
compares with data r eported in the literature. E.g., the treatment of lignin 
samples with the LigD/F/G systems yielded the highest productivity for 
vanillin, reaching a figure <  0.5 mg/g lignin after 50 h (Reiter et al., 2013) . 
Lastly, it is worth pointing out that t he presence of monomers in  the raw  
technical lignin s correlates with the severity of  pretreatment methods (e.g., 
kraft , organosolv  and sulfonate processes) and it is defined by the broad 
polydispersity index ( Vishtal et al., 2011; Constant et al., 2016 ). This may 
negatively affect the deg radation yields during an enzymatic oxidative 
treatment (e.g., for the occurring of re -polymerisation reactions) (Pardo et al., 
2018).  As shown in Table 1, t he unfractionated SKL, WSL and SLS samples  
are structurally heterogeneous and display wide PDI  (i.e. 4.1, 12  and 5.8, 
respectively). In addition, the pretreatment of the biomass increases in the 
heterogeneity of technical lignins in terms of molar mass and functional 
groups distribution, ash and sulphur content, degree of condensation and 
organic i mpurities ( Lange and Crestini, 2013; Constant et al., 2016). Since the 
features of the starting lignin play an important role to reach high enzymatic 75 degradation yields, a simple and green solvent -based fractionation method  for 
the SKL and WSL samples  was performed in order to both reduce the 
monomers content and increase the homogeneity of the lignin samples  
(Dominguez -Robles et al., 2018) . Four lignin  fractions ( ASKL , AIKL , ASWL 
and AIWL , Table 1 ) were thus prepared and used for en zymatic degradation, 
showing in all the cases an improvement of the total depolymerisation yield  
in comparison with the unfractionated approach.  More in detail, the enzymatic 
treatment of AI fractions generally resulted in a higher production of extracted 
monomers in comparison t o those obtained from AS fractions.  
In conclusion, this study reports a suitable strategy to identify the optimal 
enzymatic treatment for the degradation of the main technical lignins, i.e. 
kraft, organosolv and lignosulfonate. The  miniaturised screening m ethod (for 
the identification of the optimal enzyme/ lignin incubation  conditions)  
combined with the fractionation of lignin samples (for the obtainment of a 
more homogeneous starting material ) allow ed the identification of the most 
suited experimental setup to achieve  improv ed degradation yields.  Moreover, 
the developed degradation platform highlighted that starting from different 
raw materials, various added -value end products with different yields co uld 
be obtained, therefore  represent ing a successful approach for lignin 
valorisation.

Design and cloning of gene for MnSOD -1 enzyme  
The synthetic gene encoding the MnSOD -1 enzyme from Sphinobacterium sp.  
T2 (Rashid et al., 2015) was designed by back translation of the protein 
sequence deposited in the GeneBank database (GI: 910751193). The gene 
(accession no. MT513103) was added of six codons (encoding for six 
histidines) to the 5′ -end, of sequences corre sponding to NdeI (CATATG) and 
XhoI (CTCGAG) restriction sites, and the codon usage was optimized for 
expression in E. coli . The MnSOD -1 cDNA was inserted in the pET24b(+) 
vector (Merck Millipore, Vimodrone, Italy) using the NdeI and XhoI sites, to 
give a 6 .15-kb construct (pET24 -MnSOD -1). 
 
Expression and purification of MnSOD -1 
The pET24::MnSOD -1 plasmid was transferred to the host BL21(DE3) E. coli  
strain. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani broth (LB, 10 g/L tryptone, 
10 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L yeast extra ct) until an OD 600nm  0.7. Protein expression 
was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG and 1 mM MnSO 4 (Rashid et al., 2015) . 
Cells were collected (8600 g, 10 min, 4 °C) after 18 h of incubation at 15 °C, 
under stirring.  
Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 
1 mM pepstatin A, 10 µg/mL DNAse) and sonicated (5 cycles of 30 s each, 
with a 30 s interval on ice). The insoluble fraction of the lysate was removed 
by centrifugation at 39 000 g for 1 h at 4 °C. The total protein content in the 
crude extract was quantified by the biuret method  (Gornall et al., 1949 ). The 
crude extract was loaded onto a HiTrap Chelating affinity column (GE 
Healthcare, Milan, Italy) previously loaded with 100 mM Ni Cl2 and 
equilibrated with 20 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl. The bound protein 79 was eluted in 20 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 300 mM imidazole and 
subsequently dialyzed against 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8.  
The recombinant protein was obtained with > 90% purity, as judg ed by SDS -
PAGE analysis (Figure S1), with a volumetric yield of 100 mg protein /Lculture  
corresponding to  a five -fold increase in comparison to the previously reported 
figure  of 19.5 mg protein /Lculture (Rashid et al., 2015) . The amount of  MnSOD -1 
was estimated by measuring the absorbance intensity at 465 nm, using the 
molar extinction coefficient ε 465nm = 470 M-1 cm-1 (Rashid et al., 2015) . 
 
Biochemical and structural characterization  
The dependence on temperature of MnSOD -1 activity was assayed in the 15 -
85 °C temperature range. The reaction mixture  (final volume 1 mL) , 
contain ing 0.5 µg of enzyme in a 50 mM Tris -HCl pH 8.2, 0.1 mM EDTA 
buffer , was added of  10 µL of a 25 mM pyrogallol solution (0.25 mM final 
concentration).  The effect of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration (0 -
30% (v/v)) on MnSOD -1 activity and t he enzyme stability was evaluated 
through the standard assay (0.5 µg enzyme, 0.25 mM pyrogallol, pH 8.2) ; in 
the latter case, t he residual activity was assayed following incubat ion at 25 °C 
for 24 hours at different pH values in a multicomponent buffer (15 mM Tris, 
15 mM phosphoric acid, 15 mM sodium carbonate, and 250 mM potassium 
chloride) in the pH 3.0 –9.0 range (Harris et al., 2001 ). The thermal stability 
was assessed by the standard assay after incubation at 25 °C and 37 °C for 24 
hours in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8.   
All the spectra l experiments were performed in 50 mM sodium phosphate 
buffer, pH 7.8. The fluorescence measurements were performed using a 1 -mL 
cell in a Jasco FP -750 instrument equipped with a thermostated cell holder 
(Jasco, Cremella, Italy). The recordings of the tryptophan emission spectra 
(from 300 to 400 nm) were performed setting 280 nm as excitation 
wavelength, with excitation and emission ban dwidths of 1 nm both. All 80 spectra were corrected by subtracting the emission of 50 mM sodium 
phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. Circular dic hroism (CD) spectra were recorded on 
a J-810 Jasco spectropolarimeter and analyzed by means of Jasco software. 
The measuremen ts in the 250 - to 600 -nm range were recorded using a 1 cm 
cell path, while for the measurements in the 190 - to 250 -nm region the cell 
path was of 0.1 cm (Caldinelli et al., 2005) .  
The temperature -induced modifications of secondary and tertiary structure 
were studied by following the CD signal at 220 nm and the tryptophan 
fluorescence at 332 nm. Both the spectropolarimeter and the fluorimeter were 
equipped with a software -driven Pelt ier-based temperature controller 
(temperature gradient of 0.5 °C/min) (Caldinelli et al., 2009) . 
 
Properties of recombinant MnSOD -1 
The recombinant enzyme is active in superoxide dismutation , assessed  as 
inhibition of 0.25 mM pyrogallol autoxidation in 50 mM Tris -HCl buffer, pH 
8.2, containing 0.1 mM EDTA, at 25 °C. A specific activity of 518  5.3 U/mg 
was apparent, a value comparable with the value of 400 U/mg reported by 
(Rashid et al., 2015) . 
Concerning the enzymatic activity at different temperatures, MnSOD -1 is 
marginally affected since it  retain ed >80% activity at all temperature s tested 
(Figure S2). In addition, the enzyme showed more than 95% of its initial 
activity after 24 hours of incubation both at 25 and 37 °C. This result was 
confirmed by spectral analyses : the temperature sensitivity of tryptophan 
fluorescence (taken as a reporter of tertiary structure modifications) gave a T m 
value of 74.1 ± 0.7 °C, which is close to the value  obtained by monitoring the 
far-UV CD signal (a probe of secondary structure modification, 69 ± 0.7 °C).  
Furthermore, the enzymatic activity is not affected by DMSO up to 30% (v/v) 
concentration, maintaining a 80% of initial value (Figure S3). The 
investi gation of the MnSOD -1 stability at different pH values highlighted a 81 widespread pH tolerance resulting in a >90% residual activity in the whole 
3.0-9.0 pH range (Figure S4).  
Spectral analyses of tertiary structure highlighted a high fluorescence 
intensity , although MnSOD -1 contains six Trp residues not exposed to the 
solvent ( Figure  S5A), and a low intensity of the signal in the near -UV CD 
spectrum (see Figure  S5C). An α-helix and a β -strand content of 42% and 
15%, respectively, were estimated from the f ar-UV CD spectrum by means 
of K2D3 software (Figure S5B): these values  are in fair good agreement with 
data from the resolved structure ( 44% helical and 9% β-strands , PDB code 
5A9G ) (Rashid et al., 2015) .

A multi -enzymatic one -pot reaction for the production  
of cis,cis -muconic acid  
 
Introduction  
Lignin is an aromatic three -dimensional amorphous polymer obtained 
by the radical polymerization of phenylpropane units ( p-coumaryl, 
syringyl and guayacyl alcohols). It constitutes with cellulose and 
hemicellulose the so -called lignocellulosic biomass, a promising second 
generation renewable feedstock  (Becker and Wittmann, 2019) . 
Although lignin accounts for approximately 15 -40% of lignocellulose, 
representi ng the first renewable source of aromatics on Earth, it is almost 
underutilized  (Pollegioni et al., 2015; Vardon et al., 2015; Xu et al, 
2019) . In fact, as its calorific power is comparable to that of some fossil  
carbons (26 -28 MJ/ton dry lignin), approxim ately 140 million tons per 
year of technical lignin is burned for the in loco generation of heat and 
power  (Berlin and Balakshin, 2014; Becker and Wittmann, 2019) . 
Nevertheless, lignin valorisation is feasible by performing its 
thermochemical or biological  depolymerisation into value -added 
products (such as vanillin, cresol, catechol, gallic acid, ferulic acid)  
(Becker and Wittmann, 2019) . These compounds represent building 
blocks for the sustainable synthesis of chemicals, such as adipic acid, 
cis,cis -muco nic acid ((2Z,4Z) -hexa -2,4-dienedioic acid, ccMA) and 
terephthalic acid  (Wu et al., 2017; Becker and Wittmann, 2019; Ruales -
Salcedo et al., 2019) . Because of the relevance of these compounds as 
precursors of commercial plastics, biological routes for their  production 
have been already implemented and scaled up to the pilot scale, 
representing the masterpiece of lignin valorization  (Vardon et al., 2015; 
Kohlstedt et al., 2018) . 88 ccMA is one of the three isomers of the linear dicarboxylic muconic acid 
which global market is greater than $22 billion due to its relevance for 
the synthesis of polyamides, unsaturated polyesters, adipic acid and 
terephthalic acid, which are all chemicals involved in the production of 
a large number of plastic materials  (Vardon et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2019) . 
Currently, the industrial production of ccMA depends mainly on 
chemical synthesis using petroleum -based feedstocks  (Xu et al., 2019) . 
In order to limit the use of fossil -sources, the development of green 
alternatives for the sy nthesis of ccMA is a crucial objective for 
biotechnology  (Becker and Wittmann, 2019; Ruales -Salcedo et al., 
2019; Xu et al., 2019) . 
Recently, the feasibility of a biotechnological process for the ccMA 
production from an alkali pretreated lignin was demonst rated  (Wu et al., 
2017) . The DH1 strain of Escherichia coli was engineered with a new 
anabolic pathway for the bioconversion of vanillin (obtained from the 
thermochemical pre -treatment of lignin) into ccMA (up to 314 mg 
ccMA/L culture; 0.69 g ccMA/g vanill in) (Wu et al., 2017) .  
Nonetheless, the limits of this approach consist both in the difficulty of 
the microbial pathway regulation and in the set up of the optimal 
microbial growth conditions  (Martani et al., 2017).  To overcome these 
limitations, multi -enzymatic biocatalytic approaches could represent a 
suitable strategy  (Schmid et al., 2001; Picart et al. 2017) : system 
biocatalysis allows the combination of different enzymes, also from 
different source organisms, in a single reactor, resulting both in the  
generation of new routes for the product synthesis and in a high selective 
process (Tessaro et al., 2015; Rosini et al., 2016; Picart et al., 2017; 
Ruales -Salcedo et al., 2019). 
In the present work, we optimized a multi -enzymatic one -pot process for 
the p roduction of ccMA through the bioconversion of vanillin (the only 89 aromatic lignin degradation product globally commercialised)  (Upton 
and Kasko, 2016) (Figure 1).  
 
Figure 1. Scheme of the reactions involved in the multi -enzymatic bioconversion of 
vanillin into ccMA.  
In details, the oxidation of vanillin into vanillic acid is catalyzed by the 
enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO). Then, the demethylation of vanillic acid 
into protocatechuic acid (PCA) is catalyzed by the recombinant O-
demethylase LigM in the  presence of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and of the 
cofactor -regeneration enzyme methyl transferase MetE  (Rosini et al., 
2016) . PCA is converted into catechol (1,2 -dihydroxybenzene) by the 
decarboxylase AroY. The final reaction, catalyzed by the catechol 1,2 -
dioxygenase (CatA), consists in the production of ccMA through the 
intradiolic opening of the catechol aromatic ring. The set up of this 
multi -enzymatic system represents a sustainable alternative for the 
production of a high value added product from a renew able source such 
as vanillin, obtained from the depolymerization of the lignocellulosic 
biomass.  
 
Materials and methods  
1. Reagents and enzymes  
Xanthine oxidase from bovine serum milk (XO, Grade I, ammonium sulfate 
suspension), catalase from bovine liver (14 U/mg), tetrahydrofolate (THF), 
analytical grade standards of vanillin (4 -hydroxy -3-methoxybenzaldehyde), 
vanillic acid (4 -hydroxy -3-methoxybenzoic acid), protocatechuic acid (PCA 
or 3,4 -dimethoxybenzoic acid), catechol (1,2 -dihydroxybenzene), cis,cis -
90 mucon ic acid ((2Z,4Z) -hexa -2,4-dienedioic acid, ccMA), acetonitrile (ACS 
Grade, ≥99%) and formic acid (ACS Grade, ≥ 98%) were purchased by Merck 
(Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Methanol of ACS Grade (≥ 99%) was 
purchased by Carlo Erba. The enzyme catechol 1,2 -dioxygenase (CatA) from 
Acinetobacter radioresistens S13, cloned between NdeI  site and EcoRI  site in 
pET30+ (Novagen)  (Caglio et al., 2009 ), was produced as reported by Di 
Nardo et al.  (Di Nardo et al., 2009 ); recombinant O-demethylase from 
Sphingobium sp. SYK -6 (LigM) and methionine synthase from Catharanthus 
roseus (MetE) were expressed in E. coli and purified as previously reported 
by Rosini  et al. (Rosini et al., 2016) . 
 
2. Design and cloning of the AroY synthetic gene  
The synthetic gene encoding the protocatechuate decarboxylase AroY from 
Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae A170 -40 was previously optimized 
for the recombinant expression in E. coli (Accession no. KX774258.1)  (Wu et 
al., 2017) . The AroY cDNA was synthesized by TWIST Bioscience (San 
Francisco, USA) and cloned in the pET24(b) vector using the BamHI 
(GGATCC) and XhoI (CTCGAG) restriction sites. Notably, during the 
subcloning process, six codons (encoding for six additional histidines, His -
tag) were added at the C -terminus of the AroY gene.  
 
3. AroY recombinant expression in E. coli cells 
The pET24::AroY plasmid was transferred to the BL21(DE3) E. coli host 
strain. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Terrific Broth and protein expression was 
induced at an OD 600nm ≈0.6 by adding 0.2 mM IPTG; cells were further grown 
at 18 °C for 18 h under shaking  (Payer et al., 2017) . After the harvesting of 
the cells by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and their washing twice 
in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0, cells were resuspended at the final concentration 
of 0.8 g cells/mL in the same buffer. Cells have been lyophilized and store d 91 as a dried power at 4 °C. A rehydration step (i.e. 15 minutes of incubation at 
room temperature on a rotatory wheel in the presence of an amount of 
deionized water corresponding to the one lost during lyophilisation) was 
performed before their use  (Farnb erger  et al., 2017; Payer et al., 2017) . 
Notably, the same growth and expression protocol, followed by the 
harvesting, washing and lyophilisation steps, were performed also for not 
transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, used as control during the bioconversi on 
reactions.  
 
4. Protein quantification  
The commercial ammonium sulfate suspension of XO was dialysed against 
100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0 and the amount of XO (≈150 kDa) was determined 
by measuring the absorbance intensity at 450 nm and using the molar 
extinctio n coefficient of 36000 M-1 cm-1 (Godber et al., 2005) . The amount of 
purified LigM (≈55 kDa), MetE (≈85 kDa) and CatA (≈38 kDa) were 
estimated by measuring the absorbance intensity at 280 nm and using the 
following molar extinction coefficients: 107950 M-1 cm-1 (Rosini et al., 2016) , 
126290 M-1 cm-1 (Rosini et al., 2016) , and 53560 M-1 cm-1 (Di Nardo et al., 
2009 ), respectively.

5.1.Oxidation of vanillin into vanillic acid  
Xanthine oxidase from bovine serum milk is commercially available as an 
ammonium sulfate containing suspension. Its storage buffer was changed by 
dialysis against 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0 buffer. The oxidase activity of XO 
was determined on 100 μM xanthine as substrate in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 
8.0, at 25 °C by following for 5 min the change in absorbance at 295 nm on a 
Jasco V -580 spectrophotometer (Cremella, Italy) and using a molar absorption 
coefficient of 9600 M−1 cm−1 (Godber et al., 2005) . A specific act ivity of 1.7 92 ± 0.2 U/mg on xanthine as substrate was determined. One enzymatic unit was 
defined as the amount of enzyme which converts 1 μmol of substrate in one 
minute, at 25 °C. The ability of XO to convert vanillin was assayed at two 
different pH values : the 0.5 mL reaction mixture containing 0.22 mg (0.4 U) 
XO and 1 mM vanillin was assayed both in Krebs -Henseleit, pH 7.4 buffer 
(118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO 4, 1.25 mM CaCl 2, 1.2 mM 
KH 2PO 4, 24 mM NaHCO 3, 11 mM glucose)  (Panoutsopoulos et al., 2004 ) and 
in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 
170 min on a rotatory wheel. Reaction mixtures withdrawn at different times 
were analysed using the HPLC method (see “HPLC analyses” paragraph).  
 
5.2.Demethylation of vanillic acid  into PCA  
The LigM activity was assayed at 30 °C in the presence of 0.1 mM vanillic 
acid in 100 mM Tris -HCl buffer, pH 8.0, by measuring the initial rate (10 min) 
of a 240 min reaction  (Rosini et al., 2016) . Analyses were performed by HPLC 
as described in the “HPLC analyses” paragraph. One enzymatic unit was 
defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate in one 
minute, at 30 °C. The vanillic acid demethylation into PCA was assayed in the 
presence of recombinant enzymes O-demethylase THF -dependent LigM (0.15 
U/mg) and methionine synthase MetE, as previously described  (Rosini et al., 
2016) . The 0.5 mL reaction mixture contained 1 mM vanillic acid, 0.1 mM 
THF and 2 mM L -homocysteine (the substrate of the MetE enzyme, see Figure  
1), (Rosini et al., 2016 ) in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0. Reaction started by 
adding 0.15 mg (0.02 U) LigM and 0.5 mg MetE  (Rosini et al., 2016) . The 
reaction control was assayed in the absence of enzymes. Every 2 h, 0.5 mg 
MetE or an equal volume of buffer were added to the mixture and in the 
control reactions, respectively  (Rosini et al., 2016) . Reaction mixture was 
incubated at 30 °C for 8 h on a rotatory wheel and 40 μL of sample were 93 withdrawn at different times and analysed by HPLC (see “HPLC analyses” 
paragraph).  
 
5.3.Whole -cell decarboxylation of PCA into catechol  
The AroY activity was determined in the presence of 5 mM PCA (i.e. a 
saturating concentration) in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0, by measuring the 
initial rate of consumption of a 240 min reaction. Analyses were performed 
by HPLC analyses (see “HPLC analyses” par agraph). The activity for the not 
purified AroY (i.e. expressed in whole -cell system consisting in pET24::AroY 
E. coli transformed lyophilised cells) corresponded to 0.26 U per g of 
lyophilised cells. One enzymatic unit was defined as the amount of lyophil ised 
cells (g) that converts 1 μmol of substrate in one minute, at 30 °C.  
The 0.5 mL reaction mixture contained 1 mM PCA and 30 mg of lyophilised 
pET24::AroY transformed E. coli cells in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0. The 
reaction control was assayed by incubati ng PCA with 30 mg of untransformed 
E. coli BL21(DE3) lyophilised cells, as well as omitting the substrate. 
Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C on a rotatory wheel for 4 h. At 
different times, 50 μL of each sample were withdrawn and centrifuged for 10  
min at 13000 rpm, 4 °C. The supernatant was subsequently treated as 
described in the “HPLC analyses” paragraph.  
 
5.4.Conversion of catechol into ccMA  
The CatA activity was assayed by following for 5 min the ccMA formation at 
260 nm in a thermostated spectroph otometer at 30 °C. Reaction mixture (1 
mL) contained 0.2 mM catechol in 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 (Di Nardo et al., 
2009)  or 0.2 mM catechol in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0. Reaction started 
adding 0.9 μg CatA (0.018 mU). The product was quantified using the ccMA 
extinction coefficient of 17600 M-1 cm-1 at 260 nm  (Di Nardo et al., 2009) . 
One enzymatic unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol 94 of substrate in one minute, at 30 °C. The bioconversion of 1 mM catechol was 
carried out using 10 μg (0.2 U ) CatA in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0. The 
reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C on a rotatory wheel and at 
different times 40 μL of sample were withdrawn for HPLC analyses (see 
“HPLC analyses” paragraph).  
 
6. Combination of biocatalytic steps for ccMA production  
6.1.Multi -step sequential bioconversion of vanillin into ccMA  
The multi -step sequential bioconversion of vanillin into ccMA was performed 
at 30 °C using the reaction conditions optimised for the single reactions with 
minimal modifications: 1 mM  vanillin was incubated in 100 mM Tris -HCl, 
pH 8.0 with 0.22 mg (0.4 U) XO and 0.1 mg (1.4 U) catalase (the enzymes 
were omitted in the control mixture). After 2 h of incubation, 0.1 mM THF, 2 
mM L -homocysteine, 0.15 mg (0.02 U) LigM and 0.5 mg MetE (or an  equal 
volume of buffer) were added to the reaction mixture (or to the control). In 
addition, 0.5 mg of MetE were supplemented after 2, 4 and 6 h of incubation, 
and 0.15 mg LigM after 6 h. After 18 h, 30 mg (0.0 1 U) of lyophilized 
pET24::AroY transformed B L21(DE3) E. coli cells were added to the reaction 
mixture and incubated for 4 h. Then, 5 μg (0.1 U) CatA were added and the 
reaction was monitored for further 2 h. At different times, samples were 
analysed by HPLC in order to monitor the time course of eac h reaction step 
(see “HPLC analyses” paragraph).  
 
6.2.One-pot bioconversion of vanillin into PCA  
The bioconversion of vanillin into PCA was performed in a one -pot multi -
enzymatic reaction. The 0.5 mL reaction mixture containing 1 mM vanillin, 
0.1 mM THF and 2 mM L -homocysteine in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0, was 
added of XO (0.22 mg, 0.4 U), LigM (0.15 mg , 0.02 U), MetE (0.5 mg) and 
catalase (0.1 mg, 1.4 U). The control reaction did not contain the enzymes. 95 The reaction mixture was incubated for 18 h at 30 °C on a rotatory wheel. The 
enzyme MetE (0.5 mg) was added after 2, 4, 6, and 8 h of reaction  (Rosini  et 
al., 2016) ; after 6 and 8 h of incubation, also 0.15 mg LigM were added. At 
different times, 40 μL of sample were withdrawn for HPLC analysis (see 
“HPLC analyses” paragraph).  
 
6.3.One-pot bioconversion of PCA into ccMA  
The mixture for one -pot bioconversion  of PCA into ccMA contained 1 mM 
PCA, 30 mg (0.01 U) of lyophilised pET24::AroY transformed BL21(DE3) 
E. coli cells and 5 μg (0.1 U) CatA in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0 (final volume 
0.5 mL). As controls, reaction mixtures containing not transformed 
lyophilise d BL21(DE3) E. coli cells or lacking the substrate PCA were used. 
Reaction mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C, on a rotatory wheel. Indeed, 
5 μg (0.1 U) CatA or an equal volume of buffer were added after 1 h of 
incubation in the reaction or in the co ntrol mixtures, respectively. At different 
times, 40 μL of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and analysed by HPLC 
(see “HPLC analyses” paragraph).  
 
6.4.One-pot bioconversion of vanillin into ccMA  
The one -pot bioconversion of vanillin into ccMA was performed at 30 °C 
under optimised conditions by adding additional amounts of the enzymes of 
different times. The reaction mixture contained 0.1 mg (1.4 U) catalase, 0.15 
mg (0.02 U) LigM, 0.5 mg MetE and  5 μg (0.1 U) CatA, and 10 mg (3 mU) 
of lyophilized pET24::AroY transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli cells (let to re -
hydrate for 15 minutes at room temperature on a rotary wheel). The reaction 
was started  by adding 1.1 mg (1.9 U) XO. The 0.5 mL control mixture 
contained 1 mM vanillin, 0.1 mM THF and 2 mM L -homocysteine in 100 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 buffer. After 1, 2 and 3.5 h of incubation on a rotary wheel, 
0.7 mg (1.2 U) of XO were added; after 2 and 3.5 h of incubation, 0.5 mg 96 MetE and 0.15 mg (0.02 U) LigM were  added; after 4.5 h of incubation, 30 
mg (0.01 U) of lyophilized pET24::AroY transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli 
cells were added. Lastly, 5 μg (0.1 U) CatA were further added after 6.5 h 
from the starting. In order to maintain the same final volume, an equal vo lume 
of 100 mM Tris -HCl buffer, pH 8.0, was added in the control mixtures.  
The two -step one -pot bioconversion of vanillin into ccMA was set up in a 0.5 
mL reaction mixture containing 1 mM vanillin, 0.2 mM THF, 2 mM L -
homocysteine and the enzymes XO (0.7 mg, 1.2 U), LigM (0.6 mg, 0.09 U), 
MetE (1 mg) and catalase (0.1 mg, 1.4 U) i n 100 mM Tris -HCl buffer, pH 8.0. 
A 0.5 mL mixture in the absence of enzymes was used as control. After 2.5 
and 4.5 h of incubation at 30 °C on a rotary wheel, 0.6 mg LigM and 1 mg 
MetE or an equal volume of 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0 buffer were 
supplemented  in the reaction mixture or in the control, respectively. After 5.5 
h of incubation, the reaction mixture was added of 30 mg (0.01 U) of 
lyophilized pET24::AroY transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli cells and 10 μg (0.2 
U) CatA: the reaction mixture was incubated for further 2.5 h at 30 °C on a 
rotary wheel.  
 
6.5.Scale up of the two -step one -pot bioconversion of vanillin  
The two -step one -pot production of ccMA from vanillin was assayed in a 3 
mL reaction mixture containing 3 mM vanillin, 0.2 mM THF, 3 mM L -
homocysteine and the enzymes XO (4.2 mg, 7 U), LigM (3.6 mg, 0.54 U), 
MetE (6 mg) and catalase (0.2 mg, 2.8 U) in 100 mM Tris -HCl buffer, pH 8.0. 
A 3 mL mixture in the absence of enzymes was used as control. After 1, 3 and 
5 h of incubation at 30 °C on a rotary wheel, the reaction mixture was added 
of 1.8 mg LigM, 3 mg MetE and 80 μM THF. In addition, after 5 h, 60 mg 
(0.02 U) of lyophilized pET24::AroY transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli cells 
and 30 μg (0.6 U) CatA were added. Furthermore, MetE (3 mg) was added 
after 7 h while, after 9 and 12 h, 40 mg (0.01 U) and 100 mg (0.03 U), 97 respectively, of lyophilized pET24::AroY trans formed BL21(DE3) E. coli 
cells were added. Finally, after 9 and 12 h of incubation, 30 μg (0.6 U) of CatA 
were added, followed by an additional aliquot of 90 μg (1.8 U) of CatA after 
15 h. At different times, samples were analysed by HPLC (see “HPLC 
analys es” paragraph).  
 
7. HPLC analyses  
All the HPLC analyses were performed on a Jasco apparatus equipped with a 
Symmetry C8 column 100 Å, 5 μL, 4.6 x 250 mm (Waters, Milan, Italy) and 
with an UV detector set at 254 nm. The mobile phase consisted in 34.5% (v/v) 
methanol, 5.4% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid; the flow rate 
was 0.8 mL/min and the column oven was set at 30 °C  (Rosini et al., 2016) . 
Calibration curves were obtained solubilising standards of vanillin, vanillic 
acid, PCA, catechol and ccMA in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0 at the final 
concentration of 40 mM. Subsequently, after dilution in the 0.04 – 2 mM 
range, 80 μL of each sample were added with 160 μL of the mobile phase and 
centrifuged for 2 min at 13000 rpm, 4 °C: 20 μL of the supernatant were 
injected for HPLC analysis. Each value was reported as the mean of three 
measurements ± standard deviation. Retention times for standards of PCA, 
ccMA, vanillic acid, catechol and vanillin were: 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 7.7 and 9.7 min, 
respectively. The calibr ation curves for PCA, ccMA, vanillic acid, catechol 
and vanillin are reported in ESI † Figure  S1. In order to monitor the 
biocatalytic process, at different times 40 μL of reaction mixtures were 
withdrawn and added with 80 μL (160 μL for the two -step one -pot 
bioconversion) of mobile phase. After 2 min of centrifugation at 13000 rpm 
at 4 °C, 20 μL of supernatant were analysed by HPLC.  
 98 Results and discussion  
1. Set up of single catalytic steps  
The commercial enzyme XO catalyses the oxidation of a wide range of 
N-heterocycles and aldehydes  (Panoutsopoulos et al., 2004) . The  
oxidation of vanillin by XO was evaluated at two different pH values, 
i.e. 7.4 and 8.0. The reaction performed in Krebs -Henseleit buffer, pH 
7.4, reported as the optimal condition for XO  (Panou tsopoulos et al., 
2004) , showed the complete conversion of 1 mM vanillin into vanillic 
acid in 1 h at 30 °C (data not shown). On the other hand, using the 
optimal buffer for the multi -step one -pot bioconversion reaction (i.e. 100 
mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0), the complete conversion of 1 mM vanillin was 
observed after 2 h of incubation at 30 °C ( Figure  2A).   
The demethylation of vanillic acid into PCA was catalysed by the purified 
LigM/MetE bi -enzymatic system in the presence of 1 mM vanillic acid and 
0.1 mM THF. Because of the known low stability  (Rosini et al., 2016) ,  0.5 mg 
of MetE were added to the reaction mixture every 2 hours: after 8 h of reaction, 
1 mM of PCA was produced ( Figure  2B). 
Concerning AroY, all the available purification protocols consist in th e 
isolation of the inactive apoprotein followed by a time -consuming 
reconstitution step with the cofactor FMN  (Marshall et al., 2017; Payer et al., 
2017; Wang et al., 2018; Khusnutdinova  et al., 2019) . In order to facilitate the 
bioconversion, we opted for  the use of transformed E. coli cells (grown 
reaching a volumetric yield of 24 g cells per litre of culture). When 1 mM 
PCA was mixed with 30 mg (0.01 U) of lyophilised pET24::AroY transformed 
E. coli cells (corresponding to 0.3 g wet cells) in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0, 1 
mM catechol was produced after 4 h of incubation at 30 °C ( Figure  2C). No 
catechol formation was observed for the reaction controls assayed in the 
absence of substrate or in the presence of not transformed E. coli cells.  99 The enzymatic activity of CatA was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 30 
°C both using its optimal buffer (i.e. 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0) (Di Nardo et al., 
2009)  and 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0: the enzyme showed a similar specific 
activity corresponding to 21 ± 2 and 20 ± 2 U/ mg, respectively. The 
bioconversion of 1 mM catechol catalysed by the CatA enzyme in 100 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, resulted in the full conversion to 1 mM ccMA after 30 min 
of incubation ( Figure  2D).

vanillin to vanillic acid, (B) vanillic acid to PCA, (C) PCA to catechol, and (D) catechol

(pH 8.0, 30 °C). The chromatograms show the reaction mixtur e at the beginning 
(continuous line) and at the end of the incubation (dotted line).  
 
2. Multi -step sequential bioconversion of vanillin into ccMA  
In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the process, the multi -step 
bioconversion of vanillin into ccMA was i nvestigated in a sequential 
way (at pH 8.0, 30 °C). Firstly, 1 mM vanillin was oxidized in the 
presence of XO and catalase. The latter enzyme was added in order to 
avoid that the hydrogen peroxide formed by XO could affect the 
100 following enzymatic steps. Af ter 2 h of incubation 1 mM vanillin was 
completely converted into vanillic acid ( Figure  3A); then, 0.1 mM THF, 
2 mM L -homocysteine and the LigM/MetE by -enzymatic system were 
added. After 18 h of incubation, 1 mM vanillic acid was completely 
converted into 1 mM PCA ( Figure  3B). Thirdly, 30 mg (0.01 U) of 
lyophilised  pET24::AroY transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli cells were 
added to the reaction mixture: after 4 h of incubation, 1 mM PCA was 
fully converted into catechol ( Figure  3C). Finally, the catechol 
conversion into ccMA was obtained in 2 hours by the adding CatA: a 
total of 1 mM ccMA was formed ( Figure  3D).

vanillin to vanillic acid, (B) to PCA, (C) to catechol, and (D) to ccMA, in 100 mM Tris -HCl, 
pH 8.0, 30 °C. The chromatograms show the elution profile of the reaction mixture at the 
beginning (continuous line) and at the end of each incubation (dotted line).  
 
3. One-pot bioconversion of va nillin into ccMA  
Because of the apparent difference in reaction kinetics, the optimal incubation 
conditions for the one -pot production of ccMA from vanillin were studied by 
101 first combining in a one -pot mixture the components involved in the 
bioconversion o f vanillin into PCA and subsequently those for the 
bioconversion of PCA into ccMA (see Figure  1). 
The multi -enzymatic system composed by XO, LigM and MetE was applied 
in the one -pot oxidation of vanillin into vanillic acid, the THF -dependent 
demethylation of vanillic acid into PCA and the regeneration of the THF 
cofactor. A 0.5 mL solution containing 1 mM vanillin, 0.1 mM THF, 2 mM 
L-homocysteine, XO, LigM, MetE and catalase was incubated in 100 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 30 °C. After 18 h of incubation, 80% of PCA was 
produced: the peak corresponding to the substrate vanillin disappeared and, in 
addition to the peak corresponding to PCA, the intermediate reaction product 
vanillic acid ( 0.12 mM) was still present ( Figure  4A). 
Then, the ccMA production from PC A was assayed in a one -pot reaction 
containing 1 mM PCA, lyophilised pET24::AroY transformed BL21(DE3) E. 
coli cells and CatA in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0: after 1 h of incubation, 0.8 
mM ccMA were produced. Therefore, 5 μg CatA were further added, resulting  
in the disappearance of the peak corresponding to PCA and the formation of 
1 mM ccMA after 1 h. The bioconversion yield of 1 mM PCA to ccMA was 
thus 100% in 2 h of incubation ( Figure  4B). 
In order to set up the one -pot bioconversion of vanillin into ccMA , 1 mM 
vanillin was incubated with the complete enzymatic system XO, LigM, 
pET24::AroY E. coli cells and CatA in the presence of THF, L -homocysteine 
and catalase in 100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0 buffer, 30 °C (by adding at different 
times additional amounts of t he enzymes, see Experimental section for 
details). After 7.5 h of incubation, 0.65 mM ccMA was produced ( 65% 
yield, Figure  4C). 
An alternative strategy for the one -pot bioconversion of vanillin into ccMA 
consists in a one -pot two -step procedure which fir st leads to the production of 
the PCA intermediate from vanillin, followed by its direct bioconversion into 102 ccMA. First, the one -pot bioconversion of 1 mM vanillin into the intermediate 
PCA was performed using the optimized amounts of XO, LigM/MetE, THF, 
L-homocysteine, and catalase (see above). After ≈2 h, the peak corresponding 
to vanillin disappeared and after 5.5 h of incubation at 30 °C, 0.8 mM PCA 
was produced (80% yield) with a residual 0.19 mM vanillic acid. Hence, both 
the lyophilized pET24::AroY  transformed E. coli cells and CatA were added 
to the reaction mixture and, after 2.5 h of incubation at 30 °C, the 0.8 mM 
PCA previously produced was fully converted into the final product ccMA, 
without any accumulation of the catechol intermediate. Under  these 
conditions, the yield for the bioconversion of 1 mM vanillin into ccMA was 
80% in 8 hours.

vanillin into PCA, (B) 1 mM PCA into ccMA and (C) of 1 mM vanillin into ccMA, in 100 
mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0, 30 °C, at t 0 (continuous line) and at the end of incubation (dotted line).  
 
4. Scaled up production of ccMA  
Bioconversion was scaled up by increasing the vanillin concentration to 3 mM 
and using a 3 mL solution. The conversion was further optimized evaluating 
the addition of the enzymes at different times (see Experimental section) 
allowing full transformation of vanillin into the final product ccMA in 16 
hours, with a >95% yield ( Figure  5).

(dashed line). (B) Time course of the reaction. Symbols used: (▲) vanillin, (○) vanillic acid, 
(●) PCA,  and () ccMA.  
Previously, a biotechnological route for ccMA production from vanillin was 
reported by Wu et al.  (Wu et al., 2017) : they reported on the engineering of 
the E. coli DH1 strain with five recombinant enzymes (i.e. vanillin 
dehydrogenase, O-deme thylase, protocatechuate decarboxylase, catechol 
dioxygenase). The transformed cells were incubated with 3 mM vanillin and, 
after 48 h at 30 °C, 2 mM ccMA were produced (0.69 g ccMA/g vanillin, 
69% yield). Our work represents an improvement in terms of y ields and time 
in comparison to the whole -cell system  (Wu et al., 2017) . In particular, the 
enzymatic process overcomes the limiting step of cell -based bioconversion, 
represented by the protecatechuate decarboxylase  (Wu et al., 2017) . 
The economic aspects of this multi -enzymatic bioconversion were taken into 
great consideration during the design of the synthetic pathway. The cost of 
104 ccMA is approximately 400 -fold higher than that of vanillin (based on the 
commercial price for lab -scale amounts). Altogether, the reported lab -scale 
procedure allows to produce 1 g of ccMA from vanillin at approximately 70% 
of the commercial cost of product and with a 95% yield. The use of 
recombinant His -tagged enzymes (i.e. LigM, MetE and CatA), which can be 
easily purified with high yields in a single chromatographic step, joined with 
the use an efficient system for the regeneration of the LigM cofactor (which 
allows a reduction of the lab -scale costs from 20 to 0.07 € per mg of converted 
vanillic acid)  (Rosini et al., 2016) represent main advantages of the proposed 
biocatalytic system. Remarkably, the choice to adopt E. coli cells expressing 
the enzyme protocatechuate decarboxylase AroY allowed to drastically reduce 
both the costs and the time required for  the reconstitution of the purified 
inactive apoprotein AroY with its FMN cofactor  (Marshall et al., 2017) . 
Moreover, the lyophilisation step for transformed cells ensures both stability 
and easy storage.  
 
Conclusions  
In this work, a ready -to-use high -yield system for production of ccMA 
starting from vanillin was presented. In comparison with cell -based 
systems, the multi -enzymatic reactions allow a rapid and easy 
modification of the reaction parameters in order to improve both the 
yield and the timespan of  the process. The immobilization of this multi -
enzymatic system, aimed at improving the enzyme stability, could 
represent a further improvement pushing its use by reducing the costs. 
The development of this cost -effective and efficient bioconversion 
system  is supposed to provide a green opportunity to transform lignin -
deriving compounds into high value added compounds.

  109    “We are living on this planet as if we had another one to go to” is the lucid and 
disenchanted warning stated by Terri Swearingen at the Goldman Environmental 
Prize Ceremony, in the 1997. The constant and rapid growth of the world 
population, the effects of climate changes, the indiscriminate exploitation of soil 
and ecosystems and the strict dependence on fossil non -renewable sources are 
actual issues that modern society can no more ignore. In 2020, the international 
research organization “Global Footprint Network” calculated that the Earth 
Overshoot Day (which marks the date in which the demand of humanity for 
ecological resources and serv ices at the present year exceeds what Earth can 
regenerate in that year) worryingly  landed on August 22nd. Therefore, the 
bioeconomy paradigm, promoting a model of production which takes into account 
the building of a more equal society and the respect for  the natural resources, 
emerged in the last decades as a promising solution66–68. Notably, the branch of the 
circular economy results particularly attractive in the re -thinking of the productive 
strategi es from a “take, make, and dispose” linear chain into a more holistic 
approach in which value can be obtained from what is wasted (Figure 6)48,66.  
Notably, a large number of advantageous effects on economy, environment and 
society can be obta ined from the adoption of a circular economy model as shown in 
Figure 147,66. However, the deepen analyses of the characteristics of each territory 
and of its pre -existing productive network are both primary assumptions for the 
realisation of a targeted and integrated bioeconomy system69.  
In this view, the lignocellulosic biomass from woody feedstoc k’s, agricultural 
residues, industrial wastes and municipal solid wastes, was reported as the most 
abundant (more than  2 × 1011 t/year worldwide22,39) and suitable renewable 
feedstock to replace chemicals and fuels from fossil s ources37. In particular, 
biorefineries aim to integrate the valorisation of the carbohydrate components of 
the lignocellulosic biomass with that of the more recalcitrant lignin70. In fact, the 
peculiar structure of lignin, formed by phenylpropane un its, makes this biopolymer 
the first renewable source of aromatics on Earth2,5.   110

each step of the circular productive chain on economy, environment and society. Reprinted from 
reference66.  
This Ph.D. project focused on the investigation of different strategies for lignin 
valorisation strictly based on a biochemical approach, based on the great 
advantages in using enzymes, such  as high -selective and efficient biocatalysts in eco -
friendly and safe processes6,60.  
Firstly, the enzymatic tool-box available at the host laboratory and containing 26 
fungal and bacterial enzymes with both ligninolytic and auxiliary -ligninolytic 
activities (i.e. laccases, peroxidases, β-etherases and dioxygenases) was added of 
two recombina nt enzymes. In particular, the N246A variant of the dye -decolorizing 
peroxidase DypB (Rh_DypB, which was reported to have an increased manganese -
peroxidase activity62) and the superoxide dismutase MnSOD -1, which were recently 
identified from the lignin -degrading bacteria Rhodococcus jostii  RHA171 and 
Sphinobacterium sp.  T261, respectively . The Rh_DypB  and MnSOD -1 synthetic genes 
were optimized for their recombinant overexpressio n in the BL21(DE3) strain of 
Escherichia coli  and the corresponding His -tagged proteins were purified by a single 
 111   chromatographic step on nickel -chelating affinity column and biochemically 
characterized.   
The Rh_DypB is a tetrameric heme -peroxidase belong ing to the chlorite dismutase 
super -family (EC 1.11.1.14). Notably, the set -up of an improved expression protocol 
(which consists in an additional post -induction incubation under micro -aerobic 
conditions) allowed, for the first time, the purification with high yields (i.e. >100 
mg/L) and purity (i.e. >90%) of a fully folded active holoenzyme, avoiding the need 
for further time -consuming and expensive reconstitution steps of the apoprotein as 
previously stated in71,72 (see paragraph 3.1) . Subsequently, the potential of Rh_DypB 
as biocatalyst was evaluated under a large number of experimental conditions and 
its kinetic parameters were determined for different substrates (i.e. hydrog en 
peroxide, manganese, ABTS and 2,6 -dimethoxyphenol)  as reported in paragraph 
3.1. For what concerns its peroxidase activity, the reaction rates were fitted with a 
Michaelis -Menten equation modified to account for a substrate inhibition effect by 
hydrogen  peroxide (K i  2.2 mM). Rh_DypB showed the highest substrate specificity 
(Km of 0.03 mM) and enzymatic activity (≈ 20 s−1) for hydrogen peroxide as substrate. 
Moreover, the addition of manganese produced an increased up to 1.6 fold (≈ 34 
s−1) in the peroxidase activity. Interestingly, the enzyme showed two pH optima 
according to the fact that a peroxidase activity (0.1 mM H 2O2, pH 4.0) or a 
manganese -dependent peroxidase activity (0.1 mM H 2O2, 2 mM Mn2+, pH 6.0) was 
evaluated. This aspect was par ticularly relevant in assaying the dye -decolorizing 
activity in the presence of Azure B, Reactive Black 5 and Remazol Brilliant Blue R. 
Actually, in all the cases, the highest decolorization level was observed following 
manganese addition  (see paragraph 3. 1). The enzyme catalysed the oxidation of 
different phenolic and non -phenolic monomeric lignin model compounds (e.g., 
ABTS, 2,6 -dimethoxyphenol, veratryl alcohol), besides the cleavage of the β-O-4 
linkage of the lignin model dimer GGE, which is the most a bundant linkage in the 
lignin polymer (  50% of the total lignin interunit linkage )73. The bioconversion of 
GGE (12.5 μmol/min mg enzyme) produced the formation of guaiacol, with a  30% 
increase when ascorbic acid was added: the stabilizing effect exerted by ascorbate  112   probably reduced the occurrence of side radical reactions  (paragraph 3.1) . The 
characterisation of Rh_DypB highlighted its highly appreciable features as 
biocatalyst (including good thermal stability and tolerance to detergents and 
solvents), and therefore its applicability was evaluated even in the field of 
mycotoxi ns degradation , as described in paragraph 3.2 .  
These secondary toxic metabolites, produced by filamentous fungi mainly belonging 
to Fusarium , Aspergillus  and Penicillium  genera, represent an urgent problem for 
food and feed safety, especially in developing countries74. Besides physical (e.g., 
heat, irradiation, mechanical treatments) and chemical (e.g., peroxidation, 
ozonation) approaches for the detoxification o f commodities, the enzymatic 
treatments resulted effective in reducing mycotoxin contamination both in vitro and 
in real matrices74. Nevertheless, the main bottleneck for the application of enzymes 
at industrial level is represented by the lack of  information about the resulting 
degradation products, with the only exception for FUMzyme® (Biomin Holding 
GmbH, Getzersdorf, Austria), a commercialised feed additive which exploits the 
activity of a purified esterase to perform the fumonisin degradation74. 
This Ph.D. project investigated the possibility to enzymatically degrade Aflatoxin B 1 
(AFB 1) which, because of its carcinogenicity, was classified in 2002 by the 
International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC) as the most hazardous mycotoxin 
for human health74. In particular, the use of a previously set -up colorimetric 
miniaturised screening method for the detection of carbonyl groups (resulting from 
oxidative degradation products)75 allowed to identify the dye -decolorizing 
peroxidase Rh_DypB as the most active enzyme among a sele cted group of potential 
candidates (i.e. two laccases from Bacillus licheniformis  and Trametes versicolor  and 
two manganese peroxidases from Bjerkandera adusta and Phlebia  sp. Nfb19). 
Notably, the activity of Rh_DypB on AFB 1 was confirmed by HPLC analyses and the 
experimental conditions for the in vitro degradation were optimized (i.e. incubation 
time, amounts of hydrogen peroxide and enzyme) allowing to obtain a 96% of 
biotransformation yield of AFB 1 in 96 hours  (see paragraph 3.2) . This result 
demonstrate s the efficiency of Rh_DypB as biocatalyst since lower concentrations  113   of enzyme (0.1 U/mL) and hydrogen peroxide (0.1 mM), along with high amounts of 
AFB 1 (1 µg/mL), were used in comparison with reported studies76,77. Interestingly, as 
demonstrated by high resolution LC -MS/MS analyses, Rh_DypB catalyses the 
hydroxylation of AFB 1 into the less toxic metabolite Aflatoxin Q 1 (AFQ 1), rather than 
the production of the more stable demethylated AFB 1 product  or of the 8,9 -epoxy -
AFB 1 compound (which is the most toxic oxidation product arising from 
cytochromes and other peroxidases)  (see paragraph 3.2) . Consequently, Rh_DypB is 
also eligible in detoxification processes. In order to determine the mechanism 
underlying the molecular interaction between Rh_DypB and AFB 1, a site -directed 
mutagenesis study of putative residues involved in the AFB 1 binding identified by 
molecular docking has already been started.  
Superoxide dismutase from the soil bacterium Sphin gobacterium  sp. T2 (MnSOD -1) 
belongs to the oxidoreductase family which catalyses the two -step conversion of 
the reactive superoxide anion into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, 
according to a ping -pong mechanism (SODs, EC 1.15.1.1)78,79. On the basis of the 
metal ion cofactor, four classes of SODs can be distinguished, showing a Cu/Zn 
binuclear centre or a mononuclear Fe, Mn or Ni centre and other structural and 
functional peculiarities78,79. The disproportionation of superoxide (O 2●—) is an 
essential reaction in the protection of organisms from oxidative damages, especially 
those provoked by the reactive oxygen species (ROS)79,80. Interestingly, the MnSOD -
1 from Sphingobacterium  sp. T2 showed, beside the classical superoxide dismutase 
activity, a lignin oxidation activity (i.e. O -demethylation activity, aryl -Cα and Cα -Cβ 
bond cleavage) higher than MnSODs from E. coli  and Thermus thermophilus , 
according to a mechanism for the generation of lignin oxidants which is still 
unclear61,81. The recombinant MnSOD -1 was produced with a volumetric yield of 
100 mg protein /Lculture , corresponding to a five -fold increase in comparison to the 
previously reported figure of 19.5 mg protein /Lculture61, and a specific activity of 518  
5.3 U/mg in good agreement with the value of 400 U/mg reported by61 (see 
paragraph 3.3) . The MnSOD -1 enzyme showed a great stability after a 24 hours 
incubation at different pH values (from 3.0 to 9.0, residual activity >90%) and  114   retained >80% activity when assayed in the 15 -85 °C temperature range  (paragraph 
3.3).   
Based  on previous studies61,82, the ligninolytic MnSOD -1 activity was investigated on 
actual samples of whea t straw lignin. The identification and quantification of the 
obtained degradation products were part of an extensive study aimed to define the 
degradation yields from different unfractionated and fractionated lignin samples 
enzymatically treated  (paragraph  3.3).  
In details, a colorimetric miniaturised screening method75 was used to identify the 
optimal conditions for the incubation of three different technical lignins (i.e. 
softwood kraft lignin, wheat straw lignin and softwood lignosulphonate) with 
different enzymes from the tool -box (i.e. the lacca ses Lac C, Lac F and BALL and the 
superoxide dismutase MnSOD -1). This experimental approach allowed the rapid 
collection and comparison of more than 240 results (i.e. > 48 different 
lignin/enzyme combinations), representing an efficient support in the desi gn of 
scaled -up incubations  (see paragraph 3.3) . Notably, the data currently available 
from enzymatic treatments of lignin samples mainly reported qualitative results of 
the degradation products, with the exception for the formation of ≈ 12.5% (w/w) 
oily f raction of low -molecular weight compounds63 or < 0.5 mg/g lignin for selected 
molecules62,73 (paragraph 3.3) . Under our optimized conditions, the highest  net 
degradation yield (i.e. values subtracted of the amounts present in the 
corresponding untreated control and calculated respect to the internal standard) 
was obtained for the wheat straw lignin incubated with Lac F and the mediator ABTS 
(2 mg total mon omers per gram of lignin), showing veratric acid as the main 
degradation product (1.2 mg/g). A figure of 0.4 -0.7 mg monomers per gram of lignin 
was obtained by incubating the wheat straw lignin with MnSOD -1 and the softwood 
kraft lignin with BALL and the m ediator TEMPO  (paragraph 3.3) . Moreover, an 
acetone -fractionation of the technical lignins was performed as a green and mild 
process to increase in homogeneity (i.e. reduction of the polydispersity) of the 
starting material: in all the cases, an improvemen t in the enzymatic degradation 
yield in comparison with the corresponding unfractionated samples was observed.  115   Interestingly, a large number of value -added compounds were identified and 
quantified, such as 0.4 mg of vanillin per gram of lignin either for t he treatment of 
the fractionated wheat straw lignin with MnSOD -1 and for the treatment of the 
fractionated softwood kraft lignin with the BALL/TEMPO laccase/mediator system. 
In addition, the incubation of fractions from the wheat straw lignin with the Lac 
F/ABTS laccase/mediator system allowed the formation of 2 mg of veratric acid and 
13.5 mg of veratraldehyde per gram of lignin  (paragraph 3.3) .  
Although enzymatic treatments take advantage of selective catalysis to generate a 
reproducible process (i.e. ob tainment of a homogeneous mixture enriched in a 
certain degradation product of interest starting from a peculiar lignin sample), the 
increasing in the degradation yields remains the main bottleneck for their industrial 
application. In this view, this quant itative study highlighted the importance to 
identify the optimal incubation conditions for the set -up of multi -variant  enzymatic 
experiments (e.g., incubation time, lignin/enzyme combination, etc.). In addition, 
the fractionation of the lignin samples was a key point in its valorisation beside other 
promising strategies such as multi -enzymatic incubations and chemo -enzymatic 
treatments which will be further investigated.  
Moreover, the lignin valorisation process focuses also on the promotion of 
sustainable  solutions for the synthesis of value -added chemicals from its 
degradation products (i.e. aromatics). Accordingly, the Ph.D project also focused on 
the design and set -up of the one -pot multi -enzymatic bioconversion of vanillin (the 
only aromatic lignin deg radation product globally commercialised43) into cis,cis -
muconic acid  (paragraph 3.4) . This latter compound is one of the three isomers of 
the linear dicarboxylic muconic acid and its global market i s greater than $22 billion, 
since its relevance for the synthesis of polyamides, unsaturated polyesters, adipic 
acid and terephthalic acid, which are all chemicals involved in the production of a 
large number of plastic materials57,83. The multi -enzymatic bioconversion involves 
four reactions catalysed by the enzymes xanthine  oxidase, O-demethylase , 
protecatechuate decarboxylase and catechol dioxygenase. After the study of each 
catalytic step, the enzymes were combined in a one -pot reaction. The enzymatic  116   system allowed the bioconversion of 1 mM vanillin into 0.65 mM ccMA in 7.5 
hours, corresponding to a 65% yield  (paragraph 3.4) . In order to further improve  
the bioconversion yields, the set -up of a two -step process allowed the production 
of ccMA with 80% yield, in 8 hours, by starting from 1 mM vanillin  (paragraph 3.4) . 
The scaled -up bioconversion was carried out using 3 mM vanillin under optimized 
conditions: after 15 hours, 1 g of  ccMA was produced (>95 % bioconversion)  at the  
70% of the commercial cost  while a 69% bioconversion of 3 mM vanillin in ccMA was  
reported in 48 hours using a whole -cell approach (i.e. a resting E. coli  strain 
transformed with the genes encoding for the enzymes involved in the synthetic 
pathway)65. Therefore, the proposed multi -enzymatic system  demonstrates the 
efficacy of bio -catalytic pathways as innovative and more sustainable alternatives 
than  classical synthetic processes.  Notably, in order to reduce the lab -costs for the 
need of expensive enzym atic cofactors (i.e. the tetrahydrofolate for the O-
demethylase and the prenylated FMN for the protecatechuate decarboxylase) on 
the one hand an efficient system for the tetrahydrofolate regeneration was 
introduced84 and, on the other hand, the need for the laborious reconstitution of 
the protecatechuate decarboxylase purified in the apoprotein form was bypassed 
by using lyophilised cells expressing the enzyme. In order to further improve this 
efficient and inexpens ive multi -enzymatic system, strategies for the immobilization 
and the re -using of the enzymes should be studied. Finally, the system could be used 
in combination with known ligninolytic enzymes (i.e. laccases and peroxidases) in 
order to design a direct fl ow process between the degradation of lignin and the 
valorisation of its degradation products through a completely bio -catalytic pathway.   
In conclusion, the results collected during this Ph.D. program contribute in offering 
biochemically strategies for t he valorisation of lignin, the most promising renewable 
substitute of fossil sources. The high -yield recombinant production of lignin -
degrading enzymes (i.e. Rh_DypB and MnSOD -1) and their biochemically 
characterization were preliminary essential steps. In triguingly, the deepening in the 
biochemical study of a certain enzyme may lead to the finding of new  117   biotechnological applications, as demonstrated by the dye -decolorizing Rh_DypB, 
which catalyses the degradation of both lignin and mycotoxins. Moreover, t he 
treatment of authentic lignin samples with different enzymatic activities (i.e. 
laccases, superoxide dismutase) under optimized conditions (i.e. determined using 
conditions identified by a rapid miniaturised screening for each lignin/enzyme 
combination and the fractionation of lignin to generate homogenous starting 
samples) provided an insight on the ensuing degradation products, from a 
qualitative and quantitative point of view. Finally, the set -up of an efficient and 
inexpensive multi -enzymatic system for the one -pot bioconversion of vanillin into 
the value -added cis,cis -muconic acid demonstrated the efficacy of an innovative 
bio-catalysed pathway to perform lignin valorisation under eco-friendly conditions .    
Enzymes are extremely versatile and powerful catalysts and their contribution in the 
biotechnological valorisation of lignin has been well established. Therefore, the 
expanding of studies on their main features will allow the realisation of a 
consolidated biorefinery platform in which different expertise from different multi -
disciplinary fields co -work to reach the shared goal of a more sustainable productive 
development.
