Abstract Organisms have travelled the Atlantic Ocean
as neuston and have rafted on natural marine debrisfor millions of years. Shipping increased opportunitiesfor marine organism travel mere thousands of yearsago but in just decades ﬂoating plastic debris is trans-forming marine rafting. Here we present a combinedopen-ocean and remote coasts marine debris survey ofthe Atlantic (from 68 /C176S–78/C176N). Daily shipboard
observations were made from the Southern Ocean tothe high Arctic and the shores of 16 remote islandswere surveyed. We report (1) anthropogenic debrisfrom the most northerly and southerly latitudes todate, (2) the ﬁrst record of marine biota colonisingdebris at latitudes >68 /C176, and (3) the ﬁnding of exotic
species (the barnacle Elminius modestus ) on northern
plastic debris. Plastic pieces dominated both open-ocean and stranding marine debris. The highest densi-ties of oceanic debris were found around northwestEurope, whereas the highest stranding levels wereequatorial. Our ﬁndings of high east-Arctic debriscolonisation by fauna contrast with low values fromwest Arctic (though only two samples) and southAtlantic shores. Colonisation rates of debris diﬀeredbetween hemispheres, previously considered to be sim-ilar. Our two South Atlantic mega-debris shipboardsurveys (10 years apart) found no changes in open-ocean debris densities but resurvey of a UK and anArctic island both found increases. We put our ﬁndingsin the context of the Atlantic literature to interpretspatial and temporal trends in marine debris accumu-lation and its organismal consequences.Introduction
Prior to the colonisation of the land by plants beginningin the Ordovician there was probably little ﬂotsam onocean surfaces except algae and localised and periodicbursts of pumice from volcanic activity (though this mayhave been more common and ubiquitous millions ofyears ago). For hundreds of millions of years since thenorganisms have had limited travel on ﬂoating marinealgae, plant trunks, pods, or other ﬂoating parts as wellas on neustic animals or gas-ﬁlled shells of dead ceph-alopods. Sometimes, however, natural debris can travelfor years and between oceans (Barber et al. 1959; Coo-
mbs and Landis 1966; Smith 1985). The onset of human
travels at sea, particularly with respect to commercialshipping, marked the onset of drastically increased dis-persal for many marine organisms (Carlton 1987). In the
latter half of the last century a new persistent travellerinvaded the global marine environment—anthropogenicrubbish. Plastic became a major marine problem forexactly the same reasons that had made it a commercialsuccess. Plastic was so cheap to make, it was disposable.The resistance of plastic to degradation made it highlypersistent, even with long exposures to UV light in ha-line environments (see Gregory 1999). At ﬁrst this
seemed merely a nuisance in terms of spoiling thecoastline, but wide-scale poisoning and choking ofwildlife quickly emerged (Croxall et al. 1990; Bjorndal
et al. 1994; Gregory 1999). In the 1970s plastic particles
were discovered in oﬀshore Atlantic waters both in thecool north (Colton et al. 1974) and in the tropical south
(Carpenter and Smith 1972). A decade later mega- and
macro-plastics began to accumulate on remote mid-ocean islands (Ryan 1987; Benton 1991), increasing at
alarming rates (Ryan and Moloney 1993).
Organisms ranging from dinoﬂagellate algae (Maso ´
et al. 2003) to iguanas (Censky et al. 1998) have now
been observed to raft rubbish in Atlantic waters.Stranded debris on island shores has revealed a consid-erable biota, which in many cases would normally have

DOI 10.1007/s00227-004-1474-8been highly restricted in dispersal (Winston et al. 1997).
The global extent and levels of colonisation of marinedebris clearly represent a massive and historicallyunparalleled opportunity for dispersal for marineorganisms (Barnes 2002). Introduction of non-native
animals to new environments is widely accepted to beone of the greatest causes of loss of species (e.g. seeCarlton and Geller 1993). The avian, small mammal,
and other island extinctions following accidental anddeliberate transport of rats, cats, and goats (amongstother animals; Elton 1958; Simberloﬀ and Boecklen
1991; Vitousek et al. 1997) around the globe has pro-
vided only some insight into the potential problemsfacing marine exotic introductions.
In the sea, removal or even control of pest species is
not practical nor probably even feasible (unlike onsmall islands). It has been estimated that plastics havedoubled organisms’ opportunities for dispersal in thetropics but humans have most increased potentialdispersal at sub-polar latitudes (Barnes 2002). This
poses particular problems for several reasons; ﬁrst, theSouthern Ocean has the highest levels of endemism inmany taxa, for example, bryozoans and amphipods atapproximately 80% and Pycnogona at approximately90% (Winston 1992; Arntz et al. 1997). Species loss in
areas of high endemism is generally least desirable.Second, the Southern Ocean is probably the onlymarine environment that has no known exotic intro-ductions, and third, the Atlantic section of Antarctica,the Antarctic Peninsula, is the fastest demonstrablywarming region (Quayle et al. 2002). This is important,
as the freezing sea surface temperatures may be thebiggest single barrier to rubbish rafting exotics. Todate, rafting organisms and anthropogenic debris havebeen rare in high polar environments (Barnes andFraser 2003).The latitudinal span of the Atlantic Ocean is certainly
a highly appropriate place to quantify amounts and ef-fects of marine debris especially as an Antarctic invasionfrom the South Atlantic seems likely for at least tworeasons: (1) there are a number of high-latitude Atlanticarchipelagos just to the north and south of the PolarFrontal Zone in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula;and (2) probably most tourist and much ﬁshery shippingin the Southern Ocean operates between the southAtlantic and the Antarctic Peninsula.
In this article we outline the quantities, types, and
colonisers of marine debris in the Atlantic and theAtlantic sector of the Southern Ocean both aﬂoat andashore on remote islands. We conducted transects onseveral island shores and north–south along theAtlantic Ocean from 79 /C176Nt o6 8 /C176S and hypothesised
that (1) anthropogenic debris would be more numerousin the North Atlantic around western Europe; (2)plastic would dominate debris; (3) organism colonisa-tion would be most intense at low latitude; and (4)debris at sea would have similar composition to that onremote island shores. Finally we reviewed temporalpatterns of marine debris change on remote islandshores for which medium-term surveys have beenestablished and reported.

more daily observations were made across nearly theentire latitudinal range of the Atlantic from 26 March to22 May 2002 (Table 1). The 2002 sightings were carried
out along a transect from west of the Antarctic Penin-sula at 68 /C176S to the east coast of the United Kingdom at

aBoth Spitsbergen and King George Island had large amounts of kelp stranded on shores that are not included in this value (inclusive
values exceed 5 items/m)817Sampling debris stranded on shores
Debris stranded on windward shores of 16 islands were
examined from March 2001 to August 2002. In thenorthern hemisphere these locations ranged from ArcticSpitsbergen (Kongsfjord and Horsund Fjord) to Dom-inica in the Caribbean. A similar range of latitudes wasencompassed in the southern hemisphere shores studied:Ascension to Trump Island oﬀ the Antarctic Peninsula(Table 2). The locations of shore sample points are
shown on Fig. 1. The numbers of items per 200-m sec-
tion of beach were counted in a swath 4 m wide. Twohundred items were then randomly selected, and each ofthese was assigned to the same categories as ﬂoatingdebris and examined for encrusting fauna. The propor-tion of these 200 items colonised by fauna was recorded,and on each item the number of colonists per squaremeter was noted. Each unitary and colonial animal was
counted as one recruit. In many instances identiﬁcationof fauna was not possible as taxa dried or rotted ondebris on tropical shores, only burrows were testimonyto either isopod or mollusc presence, or volunteers col-lected data to phylum or order level only (Dominica).

Results
Floating debris
The results of our survey transect of marine debris,
across the entire latitude of the Atlantic Ocean, founddebris (and plastics in particular) ﬂoating within every10/C176latitude belt from 68 /C176St o7 9 /C176N. Densities of debris
ranged from 0 to 10 items/km
2(excluding kelp) in thesouthern hemisphere but even Southern Ocean values
reached 3 items/km2in places (Table 1). In the northern
hemisphere debris densities ranged over three orders ofmagnitude peaking around the United Kingdom andnorth-west Europe. The values we give do not includekelp for clarity of pattern interpretation. At high lati-tudes (both north and south) ﬂoating debris largelyconsisted of kelp rafts but algae was rare within sub-tropical and tropical waters. The three most commontypes, plastics, kelp, and wood (driftwood and lumber),accounted for a mean of 91.3% of items (SE ±4.84).
Anthropogenic artefacts dominated oceanic ﬂotsam
at most latitudes including the most southerly surveysalong the Antarctic Peninsula. Plastic was the mostubiquitous type of item and was the single most abun-dant item in most surveys.
The levels of all ﬂoating debris in the south-west
Atlantic and Scotia Arc region of the Southern Oceanwere essentially similar to those surveyed a decade ago inthe same regions (Fig. 2a, b). The levels of ﬂoating
debris were higher around the Falkland Islands and

Shoreline stranded debris
Only two (Trump and Wienke) of the 16 islands sur-
veyed had no stranded debris on their shores (Table 2).
Both of these were uninhabited islands on the west of the
Antarctic Peninsula. The abundance of ﬂotsam strand-
ing on island shores showed some similarities but also
striking diﬀerences compared with geographic patterns
of ﬂoating material. With the exception of kelp on the
King George Island coast, stranding of ﬂoating debris
was rare on Southern Ocean shores (Table 2), especially
south of 62 /C176S, but an item of smooth and worn lumber
was found at 68 /C176S (Adelaide Island), the furthest south
marine debris has been reported to travel. Plastics were
common on Spitsbergen shores, which at 79 /C176N repre-
sents the furthest north that artefacts have been
recorded stranded. Moreover, at 0.2 items per meter of
shore the 2002 value from Spitsbergen was of similar
magnitude to abundances on other North Atlantic
Islands (Shetland, Iceland, and Faeroes) despite the
considerable diﬀerences in geography or climate. The
highest abundances of materials stranded on shores were
in the subtropics and tropics (or Mediterranean). Men-
orca (Mediterranean Sea), the mid-Atlantic island of
Ascension, La Gomera (Canary Islands), and Dominica
(Caribbean) all had more than one item per meter of
shoreline. Similar to patterns in ﬂoating debris, most of
the material was anthropogenic and in particular plastic
(60.2% of items, SE ±6.33). In contrast to open-ocean
patterns, however, stranding values were not high
around the United Kingdom area compared to surveys
in other geographic regions.
The Scolt-Head Island and Spitsbergen surveys,
which were carried out in 2001 and 2002 (Table 2), both
recorded higher values in the later survey. Combining
the data presented here, the Atlantic data from Barnes
(2002), and other literature (Table 3) we calculated
Mediterranean Sea values to be signiﬁcantly higher for
their latitude (ANCOVA, F1=4.45, P=0.047). The
diﬀerence was even more signiﬁcant when only remote
(non-urban) sites were compared (ANCOVA, F1=10.3,
P=0.004). It is clear there is a comparative wealth of
published data in the northern Atlantic relative to the
south. Although information on stranding accumulation
of marine debris has a wide geographic base (Table 3),
patterns in time are more diﬃcult to interpret.
Macro-biota colonising debris
None of the Southern Ocean marine debris carried col-
onists but 3–7% of the northern polar debris was col-
onised at all the study island shores even as far north as
79/C176N Kongsfjord, Spitsbergen. The presence of manyindividuals of the balanomorph barnacle Semibalanus
balanoides and a large living colony of the bryozoan
Membranipora membranacea at 79/C176N is, to the authors’
knowledge, by far the most extreme latitude organism
hitchhikers have been found to reach. S. balanoides was
present on marine debris throughout the sub-Arctic and
Arctic study sites, but the exotic invasive barnacle spe-
ciesElminius modestus was also found on plastic in the
Shetland Islands. One of the most common colonists of
debris, pedunculate (Lepadomorph) barnacles, was
found as far north as the Shetland Islands ( Lepas an-
atifera ) and as far south as the Falkland Islands ( Lepas
australis ). Other plastic colonists included various hy-
droids and bryozoans (Fig. 2c, d) as well as polychaetes.
Colonists of wood, which like plastic was highly abun-
dant and occasionally dominated shore debris (Fig. 2e),
were usually burrowers such as boring molluscs and
isopods. Kelp, though highly abundant at a few sites,
carried signiﬁcantly fewer encrusting colonists [general
linear model (GLM) ANOVA, F1=32.7, P<0.01, with
latitude as covariate, but kelp of course may transport
many motile species not studied here].

smaller time frames and scaling up. Data are shown as means with
SE. Colonisation data ( b) from northern and southern polar
regions are circled to emphasise diﬀerences820The highest values of colonisation were found at the
same sites with the highest abundances of debris. The
proportions of debris with colonists ranged from 2.9%
in the Westmann Islands (64 /C176N) to 36% at Ascension
Island (7 /C176S, Table 2). These values are comparable with
similarly collected Atlantic and Indian Ocean data
(Barnes 2002;2004) and ﬁt suggested relationships with
latitude for other Atlantic data (Fig. 3). The Arctic
colonisation values reported by Barnes ( 2002) from the
north-west Atlantic (Baﬃn and Bylot Islands) were
outside (lower) the 95% conﬁdence interval of (polar)
north-east Atlantic data from the present study (means
0.0 and 4.52, respectively). This previous study found no
hemispheric diﬀerences in colonisation rates. We pooled
the data of both studies and then separated the data by
hemisphere. In contrast to the ﬁndings of Barnes ( 2002),
northern debris was signiﬁcantly more heavily colonised
[GLM ANOVA of log( y+1), F1=12.32, P=0.001] than
that in the south (see circled data in Fig. 3).The mean density of recruits on marine debris items
varied over six orders of magnitude between the sample
localities. A principal source of variability, as with
proportion of items colonised, was probably sea surface
temperature and, as a covariate, latitude (Fig. 4). The
log-linear relationship showed typical mean densities on
polar debris to be around 1 recruit/m2, increasing to
thousands or hundreds of thousands/m2at equatorial
latitudes. Diﬀerences with shore isolation or hemisphere
were not apparent.
Discussion
The opportunities for organism dispersal at the air–sea
interface have always been changing. Humans have
been accelerating this process: for thousands of years
ships have probably transported organisms, but when
Thor Heyerdahl ( 1970) rafted across the Atlantic the
most common debris his expedition encountered was
plastic pieces. Many coastal countries now have mar-
ine debris surveys at either volunteer or commercial
levels and at local, regional, or national scales (e.g. see
Ribic et al. 1997; Derraik 2002). At relatively few
localities (Inaccessible Island, Tristan da Cunha group;
Bird Island, South Georgia group; Marion and Prince
Edward islands, Prince Edward group, Signy Island,
South Orkney group; and Livingstone Island, South
Shetland group) surveys have been carried out for a
decade or more. Those coastal litter surveys and
cleanup campaigns are now widespread even on
remote archipelagos to indicate the seriousness of the
problem in terms of ecology and economics. Wide-
scale reviews of Atlantic marine debris have been
undertaken (Derraik 2002) and many countries and
islands with Atlantic coasts now have yearly coast
collections by volunteers. Synthesising the majority of
data collected by volunteer groups to interpret pat-
terns at a whole-ocean scale is problematical. There
are diﬀerences in methodologies between sites and
observers, information is often diﬃcult to access, and
surveys are scarce that actually record organisms that
were associated with marine debris. To date, few
studies have combined open-ocean and shoreline sur-
veys (Gregory et al. 1984), and never to the authors’
knowledge have any also included quantitative asso-
ciated organism data.
In the transect we report here (which was almost the
entire length of the Atlantic) conducted both at sea and
on island shores, we have shown that mega-anthropo-
genic debris is particularly numerous in the North
Atlantic around Europe and that plastic does typically
dominate debris at most latitudes, both as hypothesised.
We found similarities in patterns of debris at sea and
washing ashore, but an obvious major diﬀerence was the
lowest level of ﬂoating debris we found was at 0–10 /C176Si n
contrast to the high values we found accumulating at

The densities of marine mega-debris we found in the
South Atlantic and Southern Ocean (Atlantic sector)were similar to those found in the Paciﬁc sector of theSouthern Ocean by Gregory et al. ( 1984; Fig. 2a, b, f).
Furthermore the pattern of increasing densities acrossthe Polar Frontal Zone (from the Southern Ocean intosouthern parts of the Atlantic and Paciﬁc oceans) wassimilar. That we found (non-historic) marine debrisfurther south (on both island shores and at sea) proba-bly reﬂects the more recent timing of the surveys relativeto that by Gregory et al. ( 1984). Ryan and Moloney
(1993), Ryan and Swanepoel ( 1996), Torres and Jorqu-
era (1996,1999), and Barnes ( 2004) have all documented
increases in debris accumulation rates on (mid-highlatitude) southern hemisphere coasts. The South Atlan-tic and Southern Ocean values are low in comparisonwith those reported from the North Paciﬁc Ocean(Fig. 2g, h; Matsumura and Nasu 1997). Except around
the United Kingdom, even the North Atlantic ﬂoatingdebris densities we found were low compared withequivalent values for the North Paciﬁc and CaribbeanAtlantic (Matsumura and Nasu 1997). Matsumura and
Nasu ( 1997) found the highest densities of ﬂoating
debris to be adjacent to low-latitude continental coastand along equatorial currents. The highest values wefound in the Atlantic were adjacent to high-latitudecontinental coast but our samples included little equa-torial coast. The composition of debris (mainly plasticswith patchy ﬂotillas of kelp) appears to be similar in theAtlantic and North Paciﬁc.
The moderate debris densities we found in the east
Atlantic at high latitudes contrasted with low values inthe west (though our west samples were only n=3).
Arctic values were slightly higher than Antarctic but theoverwhelming trend was a tropics-to-poles decreasepeaking at about 3 items/km
2in equatorial waters and
coasts (Tables 2,3). Densities as high as hundreds of
items per meter may occur on Indonesian island beaches(Uneputty and Evans 1997) and wash up daily on the
Philippines’ shores (L. Conway, personal communica-tion). Similarly high values are reported from the trop-ical west Paciﬁc and east Atlantic (Table 3, Coe et al.
1997; Matsumura and Nasu 1997). Semi-enclosed seas
surrounded by developed areas are likely to have par-ticularly high (relative to oceanic) anthropogenic debrislevels and certainly this seems to be the case in theMediterranean Sea (Table 3; Golik 1997). There does
not, however, seem to be any obvious eﬀect of isolation,as remote oceanic islands may have similar levels ofdebris to those adjacent to heavily industrialised coastsin both the Paciﬁc (Benton 1995) and elsewhere (Ta-
ble3, Fig. 3; Barnes 2002).
Strong oceanic fronts, such as the Polar Frontal Zone
(PFZ), might intuitively be considered as a naturalcenter for aggregation of drift debris. We found noevidence of this despite crossing the PFZ on four occa-sions during our sampling/sighting. Spatial and tempo-ral patterns of marine debris are important for
establishment of baselines, trends, and anomalies and tointerpret possible sources. To understand the extent ofthe problem, as well as to combat it and measure eﬀec-tiveness at doing so, temporal patterns as well as edu-cation are crucial.
Are there consistent temporal trends in marine debris
evident?
In the early 1980s about 8 million items were estimated
to go from ship to sea each day (Horseman 1982). Sur-
veys around U.K. waters at this time showed muchmaterial ﬂoating in north-west European seas (Dixonand Dixon 1981), but stranding debris peaked (at /C241.9
items/m coast) in 1998/1999 in the United Kingdom andis similar to levels of a decade ago ( /C241.6 items/m coast,
see Table 7 of Conway and Fanshawe 2003). In the
southern Atlantic, beach-cleaning eﬀort and costsincreased by an order of magnitude in ﬁve decades(Ryan and Swanepoel 1996). Rubbish-strewn shores of
even the most remote Atlantic islands (Ryan and Wat-kins 1988), Paciﬁc atolls (Benton 1991), and sub-Ant-
arctic shores (Gregory et al. 1984; Ryan 1987) have been
reported. The densities of marine debris washing up onthe few remote shores monitored have demonstrablyincreased whilst scientiﬁc attention (measured as numberof studies) seems to be waning (Ryan and Moloney1993). By 1995 2.5–3.5 kg of rubbish/person per day was
estimated to be entering the sea from ships alone (NRC1995). This approximates to 0.6 million tons of litter
annually, but the growth of rubbish on land and sea hasbeen only part of the issue; composition change has beenperhaps more important.
The proportion of plastics in annual municipal waste
in the United States increased from <1% in 1960 to>10% in the 1990s (Franklin Associates 1994). New
laws prohibiting dumping at sea (e.g. MARPOL V) andon land encouraging recycling may slow the increase ofmaterial entering the oceans but evaluating this mayprove diﬃcult, as the number of sites surveyed is sosmall and from such a restricted geographic area. Thebest-studied and more remote Atlantic shores (which aremost likely to give meaningful estimates of oceanicdebris) suggest unabated increase (Ryan and Moloney1993) though there is considerable variability; there were
probably a number of time scales used, though annualfrequencies are most studied (Merrell 1980, Eriksson
and Burton 2001). The two high-northern-latitude
localities resurveyed in this study also showed increasedshore stranding debris densities (Table 2). In contrast,
patterns on the shores of Amchitka Island, Alaska overa similar period have shown no increase (Merrell 1980),
and neither have mega-debris patterns at sea in thesouthern Atlantic and the Southern Ocean (Fig. 2a, b).
Data reported here establish baseline points for a widevariety of remote shores throughout the Atlantic. Ourresurvey of the South Atlantic does not suggest any822signiﬁcant changes in abundances of oceanic mega-
debris. Intended future resurveys of both the oceantransect and the wide geographic range of remote shoreswill enable a more comprehensive and reliable view ofthe state of the Atlantic surface, eﬀectiveness of marinepollution laws, and eﬀects on marine organism trans-port.
What inﬂuences is marine debris having on organisms?
As hypothesised, colonisation of debris was most intense
at low latitude, but contrary to expectations even high(79/C176N) northern polar debris had attached animals.
Most of the shores surveyed as part of this study wereremote, so marine debris has probably travelled for greatperiods and distances before stranding. Ryan andMoloney ( 1993) reported, for example, that most of the
identiﬁable items on Tristan da Cunha (S. Atlantic)shores had possibly travelled 3,000 km before stranding.With such long periods and travels, and being sonumerous, marine debris has the potential for consid-erable inﬂuence on dispersal of biota.
The initial established eﬀects of marine debris on
organisms were poisoning, entangling, and choking ofmega-fauna on beaches or at sea (Croxall et al. 1990;
Bjorndal et al. 1994; Walker et al. 1997; Gregory 1999).
This has additional economic consequences through‘ghost ﬁshing’ (drifting nets, bags, and line trapping andkilling ﬁsh). Rafting has also come to the fore (Jokiel1990) as plastics provide a colonisable and transportable
surface for certain biota (Winston 1982, Winston et al.
1997; Barnes and Sanderson 2000; Barnes 2002).
The eﬀect that surface type (plastic, metal, wood,
etc.) has on settlement of larvae has attracted muchstudy over the last few decades (Scheer 1945; Pomerat
and Weiss 1946; Crisp and Ryland 1960; McGuiness
1989; Anderson and Underwood 1994). Despite the
intensity of study there is no clear consensus in the lit-erature; for example, some have demonstrated prefer-ences for rugose and/or porous surfaces (Pomerat andWeiss 1946; Anderson and Underwood 1994) whilst
others have not (Crisp and Ryland 1960). It is clear that
settlement preferences are complex, but plastic is nowwidely used for settlement panels. These and marinedebris studies (Winston 1982; Winston et al. 1997;
Barnes and Sanderson 2000; Barnes 2002; Aliani et al.
2003) have shown that plastic is quickly and intensively
colonised by a wide range of species.
Even with a paucity of study it is clear that rafting
biota is diverse: representatives of many kingdoms andphyla have been found (Winston et al. 1997; Censky
et al. 1998; Barnes and Sanderson 2000; Maso ´et al.
2003). Recently ships’ ballast water has also had a major
impact on movement of probably huge numbers of sea-surface species (Carlton 1987; Carlton and Geller 1993).
The impact of marine debris on species distributions isdiﬃcult to measure, even more so with respect tocomparisons with other sources (such as shipping) orepibiosis on natural motile hosts (Key et al. 1995,1996).
This study of marine debris and that of the combinedliterature (Tables 1,3) have shown anthropogenic syn-
thetic material constitutes a high proportion of oceanicand stranded material. Not only is anthropogenic debrisubiquitous and abundant, but also a high proportion ofall debris aﬂoat or stranding may be colonised, espe-cially at low latitudes (Barnes 2002). As well as being
highly colonisable, plastics may take decades or evencenturies to degrade (Gregory 1999). Plastic durability
eﬀectively opens new pathways for drift debris as thepotential time spent at sea is years, relative to organicmaterial such as kelp, which may degrade and sink (onan approximate time frame of months) at sea (Schoenerand Rowe 1970). The gradual pace of ﬂotsam travel may
also increase viability of colonists relative to ships byreduction of thermohaline shock travelling betweenmajor water masses (Barnes 2002). Whether coastal
biota attached to rafts remain viable on such consider-able journeys or not, due to starvation in the openocean, remains to be investigated. Comparison betweenvectors of marine organism travel is diﬃcult to makewith so many factors, but we suspect marine debris to bedrastically increasing opportunities for dispersal.
Despite few marine debris surveys actually recording
the presence of associated biota, drift plastics are knownto have introduced exotic marine species to the Atlantic(e.g. Thalamoporella evelinae ) and other oceans (Win-
ston et al. 1997; Derraik 2002). The presence of the
invasive and exotic barnacle Elminius modestus on drift
plastic in the Shetland Islands (though its presence onShetland rocky intertidal coasts was already beingmonitored Moore et al. 1995) is a demonstration of the
potential for colonisation and movement of fauna tonew environments on ﬂotsam. There is insuﬃcient datafor evaluation of potential impact of marine debris onanimal introductions. It seems clear, however, thatplastic ranks high in comparison with other potentialvectors of exotic organism and merits immediate con-sideration. One particular and novel area in whichﬂoating marine debris may have a major eﬀect is on thedistribution, movement, and reproduction of oceanicneustic communities (J.T. Carlton, personal communi-cation).
Substantial information about the levels of macro-
plastic drifting in Atlantic surface waters and its coast-lines, as well as that of other oceans, is being gained, butthe problem still needs to be tackled at its source. Todate, major eﬀort and expenditure have been madeclearing up Atlantic shorelines (see, for example, Ryanand Swanepoel 1996), but as well as being an increas-
ingly short-term and expensive action, it has no directeﬀect on the problem. Terrestrial introductions of spe-cies have been one of the great problems causing loss ofbiodiversity but at least an increasing number of mam-mals are being successfully removed from some smallerislands. Even recognising marine introductions is notalways easy, and removing exotic marine invertebratesonce established is improbable. Floating marine debris
823may be changing the ocean surfaces and coastlines
globally, but at least we can quantify the extent of theproblem and ultimately tackle some of the causes. Amore diﬃcult issue altogether, unseen marine debris isalso sinking to the ocean ﬂoor (Gregory 1999; Hess et al.
1999).
Conclusion
Our study establishes that amounts of marine debris
stranding on remote oceanic shores diﬀer little acrossmuch of the span of the Atlantic (50 /C176Nt o4 0 /C176S) and
Indian Oceans. However, our sampling regime poorlysampled the tropics and the west Atlantic, and this islikely to have inﬂuenced our results signiﬁcantly. Futuredata from these areas are needed for a more inclusivepicture. That we examined the most northerly andsoutherly latitudes to date is important as the levels ofdebris stranding in both polar regions is at least an orderof magnitude lower. The colonisation of marine debris,however, diﬀered considerably between the Arctic andthe Antarctic. We tentatively suggest that the diﬀerencein water temperatures (Southern Ocean sea surfacetemperatures are cooler in summer) could explain such adiﬀerence. Both the values of stranding and colonisationlevels of marine debris provide a baseline to enablefuture quantiﬁcation of changing patterns in either. Weshow that even in the Arctic, marine debris can carrycolonists including exotic barnacles ( Elminius modestus ).
Our study is the ﬁrst attempt to investigate marine
debris at sea and stranding over the same region and wedid not ﬁnd a match in our results (i.e. our observationsat sea showed high European levels whilst strandinglevels were high in the tropics). Further, in contrast tosome recent literature, we found no change in ﬂoatingdebris densities in the South Atlantic Ocean 10 yearsafter our ﬁrst survey. As introduced species are per-ceived as one of the most serious threats to biodiversityand marine introductions are so diﬃcult to counter, wesuggest that marine debris should be considered as aserious potential vector.
