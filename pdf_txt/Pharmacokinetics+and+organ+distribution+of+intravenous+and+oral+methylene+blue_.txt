Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Low-dose methylene blue(MB), which has been used safely to treat methemoglobinemia and cyanide poisoning inhumans, has energy enhancing and antioxidant properties. We tested the hypothesis thatmethylene blue treatment delays progression of at-risk tissue ( ca.perfusion –diffusion
mismatch) to infarct in permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats at two MBtreatment doses. Serial MRI was used to evaluate MB treatment ef ﬁcacy. The major
ﬁndings were: (i) MB signi ﬁcantly prolonged the perfusion –diffusion mismatch, (ii) MB
mildly increased the CBF in the hypoperfused tissue, (iii) MB did not change the ﬁnal
infarct volume in permanent ischemic stroke, and (iv) there were no dose-dependent
effects on mismatch progression for the 1 and 3 mg/kg doses studied. This neuroprotectiveeffect is likely the result of sustained ATP production and increased CBF to tissue at risk.This work has the potential to readily lead to clinical stroke trials given MB ’s excellent
safety pro ﬁle.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading
cause of disability in the world ( World Health Organization,
2011 ). Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA)
remains the only approved ischemic stroke therapy availableto the masses. Moreover, rt-PA treatment only reaches lessthan 5% of patients due to its narrow therapeutic window andits risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is an urgentneed for new neuroprotective therapies that can extend the
thrombolytic therapeutic window.
Methylene blue (MB) is a grandfathered FDA drug that was
ﬁrst synthesized at the end of the 19th century and has been
used to treat methemoglobinemia and cyanide poisoning.Low-dose MB has an excellent safety pro ﬁle. MB has redox
recycling properties in that it acts as an electron cycler andfacilitates electron transfer in the mitochondrial electrontransport chain from NADH to cytochrome c with resultant

cytochrome c, and bypassing complexes I –III, MB also mini-
mizes oxygen free radical production in the mitochondrialelectron transport chain, especially under oxidative stress
conditions. The energy-enhancing and antioxidant properties
of MB could have potential neuroprotective effects.
Recently, low dose MB has been shown to exhibit therapeu-
tic effects in a number of neurological disorders. MB reducesneurobehavioral impairment in optic neuropathy ( Rojas et al.,
2009;Zhang et al., 2006 ), Parkinson ’sd i s e a s e( Rojas et al., 2012 )
and Alzheimer ’s disease ( Congdon et al., 2012 ;O’Leary et al.,
2010) in animal models. Clinical studies have shown that MB
can slow the progression of Alzheimer ’sd i s e a s e( Wischik and
Staff, 2009 ;W i s c h i ke ta l . ,2 0 0 8 ). MB was also shown to have
neuroprotective effect in tran sient ischemic stroke models
(Shen et al., 2013 ;Wen et al., 2011 ) and in a traumatic brain
injury model in rats ( Watts et al., 2014 ).
Magnetic resonance imaging offers a non-invasive means to
track the progression of ischemic brain injury in a longitudinalfashion. T2-weighted MRI is widely used to visualize edema
and de ﬁneﬁnal infarct volume ( Shen et al., 2005 ). Perfusion-
weighted MRI can measure cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) at the
tissue level, allowing for the detection of tissue with reducedperfusion that is at risk of ischemic brain injury. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), which measures water motion, is verysensitive to early ischemic brain injury in contrast to computedtomography and T2 MRI ( Moseley et al., 1990 ). As such DWI has
become the method of choice for early detection of ischemicbrain injury. Although the underlying biophysical mechanismsof DWI signal contrast is not fully understood ( Duong et al.,
1998), the combined use of perfusion and diffusion MRI are
now widely used to distinguish reversible from irreversibly
ischemic brain injury, and to guide acute stroke treatment inpreclinical and clinical settings ( Astrup et al., 1981 ;Schlaug
et al., 1999 ).
The goals of the current study were: (i) to test the hypothesis
that methylene blue treatment delays progression of perfusion –
diffusion mismatch to infarct in permanent ischemic stroke inrats, and (ii) to evaluate the effects of two treatment doses. Arandomized, double-blind and placebo controlled design wasused to avoid bias. MRI was used to verify the presence ofmismatch at the hyperacute phase, to exclude incomplete
occlusion, and ensure similar initial lesion sizes between thetwo groups before treatment. Such subject selection, which has
been demonstrated to be critical in clinical stroke treatment
trials, would not have been possib le with terminal histological
measurements.
2. Results
2.1. Physiological parameters and mortality rates
For all three (vehicle group, 1 and the 3 mg/kg MB) groups, the
baseline heart rate (350 –450 bpm), arterial oxygen saturation
(94 –96%), end tidal expiratory CO 2(35 –45 mmHg) were within
normal physiological ranges and were not statistically differ-ent from each other, except for the arterial oxygen saturationof the 3 mg/kg MB group which showed a transient and mildreduction at the 60 min time point (from 94.9 to 91.0%,p¼0.03) and returned to pre-MB value after the 90 min time
point. This was likely due to light absorption of MB, whichinterfered with pulse oximetry. The mortality rates of thevehicle, 1 and 3 mg/kg MB groups were 1 out of 12, 3 out of 12and 2 out of 7 at 24 h after stroke, respectively.
2.2. Lesion volume evolutions
2.2.1. Overview
Representative CBF maps at 30 min, ADC maps at 30 and
180 min, and T2 maps at 24 h are shown in Fig. 1 for the
vehicle, 1 and 3 mg/kg MB groups. At 30 min after MCAO,abnormal CBF and ADC were detected and a perfusion anddiffusion mismatch was present. At 30 min after MCAO, theADC lesion volumes after MCAO were similar for all threegroups. At 180 min after MCAO, the ADC lesion volumes ofthe vehicle group were larger than those of the MB treatedgroups at 180 min. At 24 h after MCAO, T2 infarct volumeswere similar amongst the groups.

CBF de ﬁned lesion volumes for the vehicle and 1 mg/kg group
ranged from 300 to 320 mm3, were not statistically different
from each other, and did not change across time ( Fig. 2 ). At
30 min, the ADC lesion volumes of the vehicle and 1 mg/kgMB group were not statistically different from each other andboth were statistically different (smaller, po0.05) from the
CBF lesion volumes. In the vehicle group, the ADC lesionvolume increased with time, predominantly within the ﬁrst
30 min. By contrast in the 1 mg/kg MB group, the ADC lesionvolume increased at a slower rate and was smaller than thatof the vehicle group at 180 min. A repeated measure ANOVAfor the 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min ADC lesion volume timepoints for the 1 mg/kg group versus vehicle was 0.041. The
lesion volume of the 1 mg/kg group at 60, 90 and 120 min time
points were statistically different ( p¼0.009, 0.012, 0.018,
respectively) from the vehicle-treated animals.
2.2.3. 3 mg/kg group
CBF de ﬁned lesion volumes for 3 mg/kg group at 30 min were
about 290 –310 mm3and were not statistically different from
the other groups ( Fig. 3 ). At 30 min, the ADC lesion volume of
the 3 mg/kg MB group was not different from that of the
vehicle treated group at 30 min. The CBF ischemic volumes at
60, 90, 120 and 150 min for the 3 mg/kg MB were smaller thanthose of the vehicle ( p¼0.01 –0.03), indicative of increased CBF
in the 3 mg/kg MB group. Similar to 1 mg/kg, the administra-tion of 3 mg/kg MB decreased the growth rate of the ADClesion volume over the following 30 –180 min. The ADC lesion
volumes at 60, 90 and 120 min were smaller compared to thecontrol group ( p¼0.034, 0.021, 0.047). A repeated measures
ANOVA analysis for the 3 mg/kg group yielded a p-value of
0.165 for the 60 –180 min time points and a p-value of 0.047 for
only the 60, 90 and 120 min time points. Conversely, the
comparison of the ADC and CBF values (60 –180 min) for the 1
and 3 mg/kg groups was not statistically different ( p440.05).
2.3. Mismatch evolutions
To further evaluate the MB treatment effects, we separately
analyzed the central and peripheral image slices to the lesion(Fig. 4 a) for the 1 mg/kg MB group. In the central slices, thevehicle-treated animals demonstrated a rapid increase in
ADC lesion volume, reaching CBF lesion volume 60 min afterMCAO ( Fig. 4 b). However, the peripheral slices demonstrated
delayed growth of the ADC lesion and there was persistentperfusion –diffusion mismatch at 180 min after MCAO
(Fig. 4 c). By comparison, the 1 mg/kg MB group showed
decreased growth rate of the central and peripheral slices
and overall small ADC lesion volumes up to 180 min afterMCAO. The CBF volumes of the central and peripheral lesionalso decreased for MB treated animals. The central CBFvolumes for the 1 mg/kg MB versus vehicle groups at 60, 90,and 120 min were not different. Similar results were obtainedfrom analysis of the 3 mg/kg MB group (data not shown).
2.4. 24 h T2 infarct volumes
The T2 infarct volumes at 24 h were 237 79, 23578, and
22976m m3, for vehicle, 1 and 3 mg/kg MB groups, respec-
tively. They were not statistically different from each other asexpected.
3. Discussion
We applied serial PWI, DWI and T2 MRI to test the hypothesisthat MB administration can prolong the perfusion –diffusion
mismatch. Our main ﬁndings are that: (i) MB signi ﬁcantly
delays the progression of perfusion –diffusion mismatch into
infarct, (ii) MB mildly increases the CBF in the hypoperfusedtissue, (iii) MB does not change the ﬁnal infarct volume in
permanent ischemic stroke, and (iv) there are no dose-dependent effects on mismatch progression for the 1 and3 mg/kg doses studied.
3.1. Safety
Similar to prior studies, low dose MB was found to be safe inrodents. The baseline heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation,
end tidal expiratory CO
2were within normal physiological
ranges for all three groups. Low-dose MB (1 –5m g / k g )a l s oh a s
an excellent safety pro ﬁle in humans, with minimal side

et al., 2009 ). USP-grade MB is classi ﬁed as a FDA-grandfathered
drug that has been used in humans for over 120 years. The veryfew papers reporting negative effects can be readily explained.For example, one study ( Wei et al., 1994 ) showed that ‘topical ’
administration of MB given at the concentration of 1 mMinhibited guanylyl cyclase and thus reduces the second mes-senger cyclic GMP, but did not alter regional CBF and oxygenconsumption in focal cerebral ischemia. However, this was an
extremely high MB concentration (over 1000 times higher than
MB concentrations with bene ﬁcial effects). MB has a hormetic
dose –response, with therapeutic effects at low dose and toxic
effects at high doses ( Bruchey and Gonzalez-Lima, 2008 ;
Callaway et al., 2004 ). Daily 4 mg/kg oral MB has been used
safely for one year in clinical trials ( Naylor et al., 1986 ;Wischik
et al., 2008 ;Wischik and Staff, 2009 ). MB at 1 –3m g / k g i . v .
infused over minutes is used safely as the treatment of choicefor methemoglobinemia poisoning in emergency rooms.
3.2. MB metabolic and hemodynamic effects
There is evidence that MB has effects on metabolism in vitro,and on hemodynamic and metabolism in vivo. Lin et al.
(2012) showed that low-dose MB increases the rate of cyto-
chrome c activity when exposed to NADH in isolated rat brainmitochondria, and increases cellular oxygen production andquantitative cellular glucose uptake in HT-22 cells. Positronemission tomography studies using ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (
18F-
FDG) in rat demonstrated that MB increased neural glucose
uptake in vivo. MRI-based neuroimaging studies in normal
rats also showed that MB increased CBF, cerebral metabolicrate of oxygen consumption under normoxic and hypoxicconditions. Additional neuroimaging studies also demon-
strated that low dose MB enhanced the blood oxygenationlevel dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses elicited by forepawstimulation ( Huang et al., 2013 ).
3.3. MB delays mismatch progression
Low-dose MB administration delays perfusion –diffusion mis-
match progression to infarction. The effect is more apparent in
the peripheral slices compared to central slices ( Fig. 4 ba n dc ) ,
consistent with the notion that peripheral slices have moretissue at risk. A possible explanation is that MB enhancescytochrome c activity and sustai ns mitochondrial ATP produc-
tion as well as prevents oxygen free radicals formation asdescribed above.
Another potential mechanism behind the in vivo neuropro-
tective effect of MB may be related to an increase in perfusion.Our data showed that MB at 3 mg/kg transiently increased CBFin the hypoperfused tissue in the hyperacute phase. Lin et al.
(2012) also reported similar effects under normoxia and
hypoxia in normal animals. The 1 mg/kg MB administrationalso produced a mild increase in CBF that approached, but didnot reach statistical signi ﬁcance ( p¼0.07).
3.4. Comparison with previous studies
Our results are consistent with two previous studies of MB
treatment on transient ischemic stroke in rats ( Shen et al.,
2013 ;Wen et al., 2011 ). Wen et al. showed by histology that
low dose MB given at 60 min after MCAO in a rat transient
(60 min) MCA occlusion model decreased infarct volume at24 h. The novelty of our study is that MRI was used to

(npo0.05).brain research 1588 (2014) 144–149 147longitudinally demonstrate that MB delayed the progression
of the perfusion –diffusion mismatch infarct, which would not
have been possible with terminal histological methods.
Shen et al. used neuroimaging in a 60 min rat MCA occlusion
model to study MB. A pixel-by-pixel approached was used toassess the effects of MB on the mismatch tissue. MB was able tosalvage more core pixels and mismatch pixels than vehicletreated animals, resulting in /C2430% reduction of infarct volume
at 2 days after stroke in the MB group compared to vehicle group.The novelty of our work includes testing the ef ﬁcacy of MB in
permanent ischemia where MB administration delayed perfu-sion –diffusion mismatch progression to infarction This is clini-
cally relevant because MB may be used to delay the evolution ofinfarct prior to chemical or mechanical thrombectomy.
3.5. Dose dependence
We also tested whether a higher dose MB can increase theefﬁcacy of the drug in ischemic stroke. We were surprised to
ﬁnd that 3 mg/kg MB did not improve ef ﬁcacy compared to
1 mg/kg. This may be due to the hormetic dose response curve
of methylene blue which is relatively ﬂat over the therapeutic
dose ranges ( Fig. 3 inBruchey and Gonzalez-Lima, 2008 ). Future
studies will aim at studying the ef ﬁcacy of multiple MB doses
to improve functional outcome in chronic stroke.
4. Conclusion
The use of low dose (1 and 3 mg/kg) methylene blue delays thegrowth rate of the perfusion –diffusion mismatch into infarc-
tion, thereby extending the treatment window. This neuropro-tective effect is likely the result of sustained ATP production
and increased CBF to tissue at risk. Since low dose methylene
blue has a good safety pro ﬁle in humans, this preclinical work
could expedite its transition into clinical trials.
5. Experimental procedures
5.1. Animal preparation
All experimental procedures were approved by the InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee of The University of TexasHealth Science Center. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 –350 g,
n¼41) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wil-
mington, MA). Fourteen animals were allocated to vehicle,sixteen animals to 1 mg/kg MB, and eleven animals to 3 mg/kg MB. Permanent focal cerebral ischemia of the middlecerebral artery was performed using 0.35 –0.37 mm intraluminal
silicon rubber-coated ﬁlaments (Doccol Corporation, Sharon,
MA) under 2% iso ﬂurane. Animals were mechanically venti-
lated and maintained at 1.2 –1.5% iso ﬂurane in air while in the
MRI scanner. A MouseOx system (Starr Life Sciences) was usedto monitor heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation and breathingrate. A rectal probe sensor in conjunction with a water bath
feedback loop was used to maintain the temperature within
3770.5 1C. End-tidal CO
2was monitored using a SurgiVet V9004
Capnographer (Smiths Medical, Waukesha, WI). Allphysiological measurements were recorded and maintained
within normal range throughout the experiment.
5.2. Experimental procedures
A pre-determined randomized scheme was used to allocate thetype of intervention prior to MCA occlusion surgery. Thesurgeon and data analyst were blinded to the type of interven-tion. Either vehicle (heparinized normal saline), 1 or 3 mg/kgUSP methylene blue (10 mg/kg bott le, American Regent, Shirley,
NY; diluted in heparinized normal saline) was infused throughthe tail vein over 30 min after initial baseline scan (at 30 min)using an MRI compatible pump (Harvard Apparatus). Half-dose(0.5 or 1.5 mg/kg) was administered after the last 180 min time
point over 30 min. Standard behavioral tests were not obtained
due to anticipated animal inactivity and very poor healthassociated with a permanent stroke model resulting indecreased sensitivity of these t ests. Animals were excluded if
the initial lesion volume at 30 min was less than 40 mm
3or
greater than 300 mm3. This inclusion window minimized selec-
tion of lesions with poor occlusion or insuf ﬁcient mismatch.
Animals were also excluded if the perfusion imaging demon-strated baseline or delayed poor occlusion. Five animals wereexcluded due to initial lesion volume not meeting size criteriaand two were excluded due to poor occlusion. Two additional
animals were excluded due to abnormal physiology and
another animal was excluded due to incomplete MRI data.
5.3. MRI experiments
MRI studies were conducted on a Bruker Biospec 7 T/40 cmscanner with a 76 G/cm BGA12S gradient insert (Billerica, MA)using custom made brain imaging and single loop perfusionneck coils. The apparent diffusion coef ﬁcient (ADC) was mea-
sured using spin-echo diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging
a n dt w obv a l u e so f4a n d1 2 0 0 s / m m
2,a n dT E ¼30 ms ( Shen
et al., 2005 ). The cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was measured using
continuous arterial spin labeling with a 2.7-s square radio-frequency pulse applied to the labeling coil followed by a250 ms post-labeling delay and TE ¼10.2 ms. T2 maps were
acquired using fast spin echo with four effective echo times (25,40, 75 and 120 ms), echo train length 4, and 8 signal averages.The common parameters for these three sequences were:seven 1.5 mm thick slices, single shot, TR ¼3s ,m a t r i x ¼96/C296
(reconstructed to 128 /C2128), ﬁeld of view ¼25.6/C225.6 mm, 90 1
ﬂip angle. ADC and CBF maps were acquired at 30, 60, 90, 120,
150, and 180 min post-occlusion and on day-1 (24 72h )a n dT 2
maps were acquired on day-1 (24 72h ) .
5.4. Data analysis
ADC and CBF measurements were collected every 30 min over
3 h after stroke to monitor the evolution of the ischemicpenumbra ( Meng et al., 2004 ). The 60 min time point was
obtained immediately after termination of the drug infusion.T2 map was calculated at day 1. Cerebral blood ﬂow measure-
ments were used to estimate perfusion. In order to minimize
the subjectivity associated with independent ROI measure-
ments, ADC region of interest regions were drawn in eachcontralateral normal hemisphere including cortex and striatumbrain research 1588 (2014) 144–149 148to correct for possible ﬂuctuation in ADC signal. An upper limit
signal threshold for infarcted ADC values was calculated fromthe mean normal hemisphere ADC signal minus three times
the standard deviation of the non-infarcted tissue. Regions that
met this 99.7% difference signal threshold in the contralateral(normal) hemisphere were not included in the infarct lesionvolume measurements and were considered artifact. A thresh-old for abnormal CBF values was calculated from the meannormal hemisphere CBF signal minus one times the standarddeviation of the non-infarcted hemisphere to be able to detectsubtle changes in PWI volume. Final infarct volume wasdeﬁned using T2 maps at day 1 (24 72h ) u s i n g t h r e s h o l d o f
the mean T2 signal value of the normal hemisphere plus twotimes the standard deviation. Edema-corrected infarct volume
was calculated as infarct volume –(right hemisphere volume –
left hemisphere volume).
5.5. Statistical analysis
Lesions volumes are presented as mean 7standard error of
mean. ANOVA with repeated measures correction was usedto evaluate global differences in lesion volumes acrossdifferent 60 –180 min time points. The Student ’st-test was
used to test the null hypothesis that the saline group meanlesion volume is not greater than the MB treated lesion
volume for the individual time points. Statistical and data
analysis was conducted in MedCalc 12.7.0 (MedCalc Software,Ostend, Belgium) and Stimulate 8.0.1 (University of Minne-sota). Values were expressed as means 7S.E.M. A po0.05 was
considered statistically signi ﬁcant.
