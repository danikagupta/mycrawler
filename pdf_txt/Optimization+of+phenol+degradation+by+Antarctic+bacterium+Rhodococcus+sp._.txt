 Effective bioremediation requires optimisation of conditions under which the process takes place. In this study , an Antarctic soil bacterium, 
Arthrobacter  sp. strain AQ5-15, was evaluated for phenol biodegradation under statistically optimised conditions.
The composition of degradation media and the culture conditions for this study were determined according to the experimental 
requirements obtained from Plackett-Burman factorial design (PB) and Box-Wilson 
Central Composite Design (CCD), respectively . Phenol degradation was monitored 
by 4-aminoantipyrine colorimetric assay and bacterial growth was quantified by 
measuring optical density (OD ) at 72 hr.      600 nm
A preliminary screening experiment using the Plackett-Burman design 
indicated that all the factors screened (ammonium sulphate concentration, sodium 
chloride concentration, pH and temperature) had significant influence on 
degradation performance. Response Surface Methodology was then utilised to 
further optimise the phenol-degrading process using Central Composite Design. 
The maximum percentage of phenol degradation achieved with CCD was 99.42%, -1 -1
under medium conditions of 0.15 g l (NH)SO, 0.13 g l NaCl, pH 7.25 and 42 4
incubation at 15°C for 72 hr. The strain could degrade phenol when exposed to an -1
initial concentration of up to 1.5 g l under these optimised conditions.       
The tolerance and degradation characteristics of strain AQ5-15 
suggest that it has potential application in bioremediation of polluted sites and in the 
treatment of relatively cool water bodies contaminated with phenol.

addition, it may not predict the true optimal conditions since 
interactions between the factors are neglected (Vajić et al., 2015). 
With advances in statistical analyses and information technology , 
numerous statistical software packages have been developed as 
optimisation tools to aid in bioreactor design (Nawawi et al., 2016; 
Yusuf et al., 2016; Yaacob et al., 2016). One of the well-known 
software, Design-Expert Version 6, is programmed to calculate 
the statistical values and probability to define the minimum run of 
experiments required to recognize significant cause-and-ef fect 
relationships between a given number of variables and 
responses.
This software comprise four categories of Design of 
Experiment (DoE) which are factorial, response surface, mixture 
and crossed-process mixture (Alben, 2002). Mathematical and 
statistical approaches such as Response Surface Methodology 
(RSM) can be used in optimising multiple factors collectively , 
avoiding the limitations of single factor optimisation approaches 
such as OFAT (Zhou et al., 2011). RSM is a sequential procedure 
that begins with significant factor screening using a two-level 
factorial design such as Plackett-Burman design (PB) to find the 
region of optimum, and then modelling and optimising the 
response with a three-level factorial design such as Box-Behnken 
Central Composite Design (CCD) (Ibrahim et al., 2015; Karamba 
et al., 2016). In recent years, many studies have reported the use 
of RSM to statistically optimise phenol-degrading processes 
(Sivasubramanian and Namasivayam, 2015; Priyadharshini and 
Bakthavatsalam, 2016). However , as yet, there has been no 
application of statistical optimisation for phenol degradation by 
bacterial strains indigenous to Antarctic continent. The current 
study addresses statistical approach optimisation using PB 
design and CCD to enhance the phenol-degrading process by 
native bacterium, Arthrobacter  sp. strain AQ5-15.
Materials and Methods
Inoculum preparation:  Arthrobacter  sp. strain AQ5-15,a soil 
bacterium previously isolated from the western part of King 
George Island, Antarctica (Subramaniam et al.,  2019) was used 
in this experiment. The bacterial strain was retrieved from storage 
in glycerol at -80°C, grown and maintained in nutrient broth 
(Friendemann Schmidt, Australia) at 10°C on an orbital shaker 
(Protech Model 722, Malaysia) agitated at 150 rpm, in the Eco-
Remediation Technology Laboratory , Universiti Putra Malaysia. 
About 10% (v/v) of culture was used as standard inoculum 
throughout this optimisation study .
Optimisation study:  Minimal salt medium (MSM) containing 0.5 g -1
l phenol was inoculated with 10% (v/v) of bacterial culture and 
incubated on the shaking incubator at 150 rpm for 72 hr. 
Uninoculated sterile MSM was used as control for confirming the 
ability of strain to utilise phenol as a sole carbon source. MSM 
comprised (per litre) KHPO (0.4), KHPO (0.2), NaCl (0.1), 2 4 2 4

Phenol is an aromatic hydrocarbon commonly derived 
from industrial activities. It has been classified as a high priority 
toxicant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
(US EPA, 2014) due to its toxicity to living systems and 
recalcitrant nature. Since Industrial Revolution, there has been a 
progressive increase in pollution across the globe (Teĺlez-Per ́ez 
et al., 2013). Among pollutants, phenol contamination has 
become one of the most prevalent in the environment, requiring 
urgent mitigation actions as it may cause negative impacts on 
biological systems and also human beings (Zhou et al., 2011; Lee 
et al., 2017). Anthropogenic pollution is apparent even in the 
continent that many consider to be the most pristine and 
isolated, Antarctica. Since the mid-Twentieth Century, the 
construction and operation of over 50 Antarctic research 
stations, increasing tourism activities, increased shipping and 
air transportation and the rapid growth of industrial activities in 
distant countries of Southern and Northern Hemispheres have 
resulted in detectable pollution, including phenol, in Antarctica 
(Bargagli, 2008; Mazuki et al., 2019). Antarctica’s ecosystems 
and biota are highly sensitive to pollution. Furthermore, the 
continent’s chronically cold and harsh climate means that the 
natural processes involved in remediation of pollution occurs 
slowly as compared to others places. As a result, pollutants can 
bioaccumulate in Antarctica’s simple ecosystems and food 
chains (Jara-Carrasco et al., 2017).
Phenol can be removed from the environment by physical 
and chemical means (Mijangos et al., 2006; Caetano et al., 2009; 
Mohammadi et al., 2015). However , biological remediation 
technology has become the preferred approach due to their cost 
effectiveness, ecofriendly nature, applicability , and usually 
generates non-toxic end products (Ahmad et al., 2017; Suárez-
García et al., 2019). The Antarctic Treaty prohibits the importation 
of non-native organisms into Antarctica, meaning that application 
of bioremediation approaches in this continent can only be 
achieved using indigenous microorganisms (Ibrahim et al., 2020). 
A number of studies have reported the ability of native Antarctic 
microorganisms, mainly from the genera Arthrobacter  and 
Rhodococcus,  to degrade phenol at low temperature (Ahmad et 
al., 2018; Zakaria et al., 2018). However , identifying such 
microbes is the stepping stone for the development of 
bioremediation process. Environmental factors and nutritional 
parameters such as temperature, pH, salinity , and the presence 
and type of nitrogen and carbon sources exert important influence 
on the phenol-degrading capacity and growth rate of 
microorganisms (Lee et al., 2018; Tengku-Mazuki et al., 2020). 
Consequently , it is important to optimise these factors to enhance 
the bioremediation process at laboratory scale, before making an 
attempt to apply the process in the field environment.
Conventionally , a method such as one-factor-at-time 
(OFAT) is used for this optimisation process, allowing 
assessment of optimum value of each factor individually (Vera 
Candioti et al., 2014). However , this approach is time-consuming 1561 K.

experimental variables were coded based on eq. 2:

where, X is the coded value of i independent variable, x i
th
is the uncoded value of i independent variable, x is the uncoded i
th
value of i independent variable at the centre point and ∆x is the i
step change value. The codes are calculated as a function of 
range of interest of each variable as shown in Table 2. The 
significance of model and each coefficient in the equation were 
examined using Fischer ’s F-test and Analysis of Variance 
(ANOV A). The response surface and 3D contour plots of the 
predicted model were used to evaluate the interaction between 
significant variables.
Results and Discussion
As a first step, Plackett Burman factorial design (PB) was 
used as it is an effective screening method to identify most 
important variables among multiple variables that have a positive 
influence on the process being examined (Patil and Jena, 2015; 
Priyadharshini and Bakthavatsalam, 2016). The significance of 
four factors, namely (NH)SO concentration (x), NaCl 42 1
concentration (x), pH (x) and temperature (x) in phenol 2 3 4
degradation by AQ5-15 were analysed with 12 different 
combinations of experiments as shown in Table 3. The range for 
all four variables affecting phenol degradation was decided based -1
on the result from OFAT as follows: 0.4 - 0.6 g l (NH)SO, 0.1 - 42
-1
0.15 g l NaCl, pH of 7.0 - 7.5, temperature at 10°C-20°C -1
(Subramaniam et al., 2019). The initial concentration of 0.5 g l 
was selected for optimisation based on previous studies which 
used this concentration for screening for phenol biodegradation 
(Lee et al., 2018) as higher phenol concentration can be inhibitory 
to the growth of psychrotolerant bacteria (Li et al., 2010; Sepehr et 
al., 2019). Table 3 shows both experimental and predicted values 
for phenol degradation by strain AQ5-15, based on the 12 runs 
given by PB design. Fischer ’s F-test showed that the model was 
significant (F = 558.8259, p = 0.0018) (Table 4). 
All four variables exhibited significant effects on phenol 
degradation and, hence, were employed in the designing of CCD. 
Das and Chandran (2011) noted that nutrient availability , 
especially nitrogen source, can act as a limiting factor , and that 
nutrient concentration might either enhance or inhibit i

4degradation media and the culture conditions for this study were 
determined according to the experimental requirements obtained 
from Plackett-Burman factorial design (PB) and Box-Wilson 
Central Composite Design (CCD), respectively. Phenol 
degradation was monitored at 72 hr using 4-aminoantipyrine 
colorimetric assay following the of American Public Health 
Association (APHA, 2005). Based on the method, the pH of 
phenol media to be tested was adjusted to pH 10, followed by 
addition of one percent of 4-aminoantipyrine and potassium 
ferricyanide from the total media to be tested. The 
colour of the solution and bacterial growth (OD ) were quantified 600
using a UV/V isible spectrophotometer (Jenway Model 7305, UK) 
at 510 nm and 600 nm, wavelength, respectively .
Experimental design: Researchers focus on statistical 
approaches like RSM that often produce enormous return-of-
investment (ROI) at this breakthrough phase (Anderson and 
Whitcomb, 2004). The core idea of RSM is to use a sequence of 
designed experiments to achieve one or more optimal responses. 
The experimental design and statistical analyses were generated 
using Design-Expert Version 6.0.8 (Stat-Ease Inc. Minneapolis, 
USA). Each variable ((NH)SO concentration, NaCl 42
concentration, pH and temperature) was screened using PB, 
followed by CCD to identify the optimum levels of significant 
variables obtained from optimisation via OFAT approach from 
previous study , characterising the response surface in the 
selected experimental region. Both experiments were run in 
triplicate with the average of phenol degradation percentage and 
bacterial growth taken as the responses. The influential variables 
(p<0.05) screened by PB were selected and optimised using 
quadratic factorial CCD by combining two factorial points, a sole 
central point and two axial points (+2, +1, 0, -1, -2) (Table 1) 
leading to a total of 30 runs. The response from the interactions 
between different factors was specified using a second-order 
polynomial regression model comprising linear , quadratic and 
interaction coefficients, as given in eq. 1:
where, y represents the response variable, x are the i
independent variables that affect y,k is the number of variables, th

degradation. NaCl concentration can adversely affect the 
biological performance of microorganisms dramatically , for 
instance affecting the suspended solid concentration in effluent 
and, thus, reducing the efficiency of organic compound removal 
by inhibiting bacterial metabolism (Chen et al.,  2018). pH is also 
considered highly significant because most microbes are unable 
to tolerate high or low pH (Shah, 2018). Finally , temperature can 
affect both the physical state of pollutants as well as directly 
influence microbial growth rates and metabolic process (Varjani 
and Upasani, 2017; Subramaniam et al., 2019). 
The analysis of variance (ANOV A) of experimental results 
from the PB design showed that the model was well supported 
(Table 4). The F-value of 12.637 implied that Lack of Fit was not 
significant relative to the pure error where there was a 17.46% 
chance that a "Lack of Fit F-value" this large could occur due to 
noise. Insignificancy of lack of fit is good for the model to be fit 2
(Sanusi et al., 2016). ANOV A on the model design displayed a R 
of 0.9996 showing the closeness of data to the fitted regression 
line. The "Pred R-Squared" of 0.9442 was in reasonable 
agreement with the "Adj R-Squared" of 0.9978 and the "Adeq 
Precision" of 60.396 indicated an adequate and satisfactory 
signal. A low coefficient of variation of (0.43%) showed that 
the model was precise and highly reliable. The CCD design of value RSM experiments, using all four significant variables from PB, 
with the experimental and predicted values for phenol 
degradation are presented in Table 5. A total of 30 sets of 
experiments were generated by CCD using different sets of 
values for the variables, including outliers. The maximum 
percentage of phenol degradation was observed in run 16 -1 -1 
(99.42%) with medium conditions of 0.15 g l (NH)SO, 0.13 g l 42 4
NaCl, pH 7.25 and incubation temperature of 15°C. The 
regression equation coefficients were calculated as shown in 
Table 6, and the data were fitted to a second-order polynomial 
equation to be used for predicting optimum combination of 
conditions. The relationship between phenol degradation and the 
variables is shown in eq. (3) and (4) in terms of actual and coded 
factors, respectively . The predicted response is indicated by Y 
and x, x, x and x are the coded values of (NH)SO, NaCl, pH 1 2 3 4 42 4
and temperature, respectively . Positive and negative signs in the 
regression equation signify either synergistic or antagonistic 
effects of each variable on the response.

The ANOV A of experimental results for CCD showed that 
the experimental data fitted well to the statistical model, with a 
statistically significant model (T able 6). The "Lack of Fit F-value" 
of 3.50 indicated 8.86% chance that a "Lack of Fit F-value" this 
large could occur due to noise and insignificant lack of fit is 
needed for a model to fit. The value of Prob>F<0.0001 illustrated 2 2
that the two linear terms (x, x), all four quadratic terms (x1, x2, 3 4
2 2
x3, x4) and one interaction term (xx) of the model were 34
significant, and the model specified that the two most influential 
variables were pH (x) and temperature (x). Based on the 3 4

The slightly elliptical 3D plot shows interaction between the two 
most significant factors namely pH and temperature. The curved 
response surface specified that there are well-defined optimal 
variables because flat surface near the optimum means the 
optimised values may not differ largely from single variable 
conditions (Ibrahim et al., 2015). The model predicted that 
maximum phenol degradation will be achieved between pH 7.13 - 
7.5 and temperature range of 15°C - 17.5°C. Here it can be 
observed that the efficiency of phenol degradation having a 
negative effect at low temperature and acidic condition as well as 
at high temperature and alkaline condition. The temperature 
effect was more notable at pH 7 and 7.5, thus maximum phenol 
degradation can be achieved at neutral or near neutral condition 
with increased temperature.
Temperature is normally considered as one of the most 
influential factors, particularly in polar region as degradation must 
obey the Arrhenius law. According to the Arrhenius relationship, 
the degradation of a pollutant is highly dependent on temperature 
in where an increase or decrease in temperature can affect the 
rate of degradation (Arrhenius, 1889; Kulkarni et al.,  2017). This experimental design data. The "Pred R-Squared" of 0.9209 is in 
reasonable agreement with the "Adj R-Squared" of 0.9682. "Adeq 
Precision" of 35.732 indicated an adequate signal as it measures 
that the signal to noise ratio and a ratio greater than 4 is desirable. 
These results specify that these significant factors can act as 
limiting factors and minute variations in their value can affect the 
degradation rate of phenol.
Similarity between the predicted and actual analyses of 
the effects of variables on phenol degradation is shown in Fig. 1. 
The plot displays a close correlation between predicted and 
actual data as data points were accumulated closer to the line that 
bisects the plot at an angle of 45°. Based on Table 6 and Fig. 1, it 
can be deduced that the predicted values attained from the 
quadratic model were in good agreement with the experimental 
values (Sanusi et al., 2016). This RSM tool comprised features for 
point prediction and interpret graphically through 3D response 
surface curve that could be handy in predicting the optimum value 
of significant factor interaction for maximum phenol degradation 
efficiency . Fig. 2 illustrates the 3D plot for optimum phenol 
degradation with combination of significant variables (x and x). 3 4Table 6:  ANOV A for phenol degradation by strain AQ5-15 using CCD

optimum temperature for phenol degradation by strain AQ5-15 
supports the potential use of this strain for phenol degradation in 
soils in cold regions. Similar to this strain, most hydrocarbon-
degrading Antarctic bacteria have been reported to be 
facultatively psychrotolerant with optimum temperature for 
biodegradation activity ranging between 10-20°C (Gran-
Scheuch et al., 2017; Roslee et al., 2019). 
However , highly seasonal polar regions like Antarctica 
generally have annual mean air temperature below 0°C and 
reach positive daily values only for few short summer months (1-4 
months) or weeks. Consistent with this, Convey et al. (2018) 
reported that on Signy Island, the annual mean of 
1.7°C whereas annual maximum and minimum is 
18.4 and -8.7°C, respectively . As for air temperature, the mean 
monthly temperature reach low positive values during summer , 
with annual mean of -3.9°C and annual maximum and minimum 
of 8.6 and -30.1°C, respectively . Biological activity will be minimal 
or undetectable during sub-zero habitual temperatures. Hence, 
any bioremediation approaches will only be effective during brief 
polar summer period when, with positive temperatures, unfrozen 
soils will have accessible water sources (Lee et al., 2018). It is 
important to note that strain AQ5-15, being psychrotolerant where 
the strain is viable at temperature range of 5-25°C (Subramaniam 
et al., 2019) and even at optimum temperature >15°C, is able to ground 
temperature is grow and function well at suboptimal positive temperatures, 
hence this strain still has the potential to grow and degrade phenol 
sub-optimally in Antarctic soils. The RSM model was validated 
using the values predicted for each parameter as shown in Table 
7. The result showed no significant difference between the 
percentage of phenol degradation given by both predicted 
(95.33%) and experimental approaches (96.42%).
Fig. 3 shows degradation of different concentrations of 
phenol by strain AQ5-15 under optimised conditions obtained 
from CCD. The strain has the ability to degrade phenol up to 1.5 g -1
l within 24 hr. On increacsing the phenol concentration to 1.7 g l-
1, the strain started to lose its degradation ability . Studies on cold 
tolerant bacteria isolated from alpine soils of Binaloud Mountains 
have shown that Pseudomonas sp. strain ATR208 can -1
completely degrade phenol up to 0.6 g l at higher time (Sepehr et 
al., 2019). On the basis of previous studies, Antarctic -1
microorganisms are reported to degrade phenol up to 0.5 g l  at 
temperature as low as 10°C (Gerginova et al., 2013; Lee et al., 
2018). Phenol is a major constituent in fuel oil, pharmaceutical 
and personal care products (Kim et al., 2018; Harley et al., 2019) 
and can be released into the Antarctic environment via many 
channels, particularly during marine accidents and the disposal of 
‘grey water ’ wastes from research stations (Emnet et al., 2015; 
Vázquez et al., 2017; Martorell et al., 2019). Singh et al. (2013)

reported that petroleum wastewater containing 140-480 mg l of -1
oil included phenol at concentrations ranging from 1.2-3.71 mg l. 
Antarctica has also experienced multiple marine accidents with 
the release of large quantities of oil. For instance, a major fuel oil 
spill occurred in 1989 when the Argentine vessel Bahia Paraiso,  
that was en route  to resupply an Argentinian research station, ran 
aground and sank near Palmer Station, Anvers Island, Antarctic 
Peninsula, releasing over 150 000 gallons of diesel (Kennicutt et 
al., 1991). Recently , a similar event took place in the Galápagos 
Islands in December 2019, where a barge carrying 600 gallons of 
diesel oil sank off the dock (Oxford Analytica, 2019). Having highly 
persistent and anti-microbial properties, phenol can accumulate in 
the environment to high concentration (Krastanov et al., 2013; 
Sachan et al., 2019). Thus, this is the first report of an Antarctic 
bacterium Arthrobacter sp. strain AQ5-15 with higher tolerance and 
ability to degrade high concentration of phenol at 15°C. 
In conclusion, statistical optimisation by RSM revealed -1
that the combination of 0.5 g l (NH)SO, 0.13 g l NaCl, pH 7.25, 42
and temperature of 15°C resulted in maximum phenol degradation 
by the native Antarctic soil bacterium, Arthrobacter  sp. strain AQ5-
15. The strain could tolerate and degrade an initial concentration 
of up to 1.5 g l of phenol under optimised conditions. According to 
this study , the statistical approach could be a valuable alternative 
to the conventional one-factor-at-time (OFAT) method for the 
optimisation of phenol degradation in wastewater treatment.
