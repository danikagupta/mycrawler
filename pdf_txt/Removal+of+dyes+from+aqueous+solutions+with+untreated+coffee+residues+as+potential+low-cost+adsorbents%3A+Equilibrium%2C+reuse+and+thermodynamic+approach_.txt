Introduction  
Water is very essential to our life, animal life, processing industry, plantation and aquatic system. If the dye effluent 
wastewater dis charges in hydrosphere, because of that water quality degrade and their adverse effect to environment. The 
greatest environmental concern problem deals with dyes absorption and reflection of sunlight that entered to water which 
interferes on the growth of bacteria level cannot biologically degradable in the water body. Because color is very high 
wavelength (200 to 800 nm) in the water so directly effect on absorption of sun light in water body and there also side effec t 
on photosynthesis reaction, when lake  of photosynthesis reaction its adverse effect of plankton growth and their adverse 
effect to fisheries production.[1]. If fish production is low so naturally water purification system effect and there directl y 
impact too environmentally and economically l oss due to discharge of effluent dye wastewater in fresh water. This problem 
can be solved by different engineering method such as physical method, chemical method and biological method.  
The Some dye manufacturing institute showed that the basic dyes are g enerally more toxic than acid or direct dyes. 
And some commercial dye are harmful to some microorganisms .Many dyes may cause allergic derma tics, dysfunction of 
kidney, skin irritation, central nervous system, liver, and brain. Organic dyes are harmful to  human beings. The need to 
remove dye from waste water effluents become environmentally significance  
The main factor which on the adsorption process are surface area, pore size, chemical composition and dyes 
properties such as molecular size, molecular pol arity. Activated carbon is the most widely used adsorbent for dye removal 
because of its micro –pore structures, high adsorption capacity, extended surface area and high degree of surface reactivity. 
However, commercially available activated carbon is very  expensive and has high regeneration cost.  
Dyeing is a process of coloring the fabric using dyes which are organic compounds. They are widely used for 
imparting colour to textiles industry and other many industry. They are produced either synthetic or natu rally. Dyeing 
properties depended on two reasons. First, the sizes of the dye molecules are smaller than the size of the pores in the fiber . 
The second reason is the affinity of the dye to the fiber due to forces of attraction . The dye which has diffused o r penetrated 
into the fiber is held there by the forces of attraction between the dye and the fiber. Dyes could be either obtained from 
natural and synthetic sources. Dye is naturally occurring in the nature such as wood, leaf of tree, soil, bark of tree, seed, root, 
minerals, fungi, and insect, clay and microorganism. Sources of dye are two type, naturally and synthetic. Naturally dye 
source is from clay, bark of tree. Leaf, root .seed, fungi, Minerals and microorganism [2]. Synthetic dyes are obtained fro m 
many different industry such as cosmetics industry, printing industry, rubber industry, plastic industry, textiles industry a nd 
dye and pigment industry. All the above industry effluent discharge in fresh water source so water quality degradable.  
Method of dye removal.  
Basically there are three methods Such as Physical Methods, chemical Methods & Biological Methods  
 
Physical method  
Physical method includes as membrane filtration process, reverse osmosis, electrolysis, sedimentation, and 
adsorption. Adsorp tion treatment method is an effective alternative method used to remove dye from waste water. The 
adsorption treatment has many advantages such as low cost; easily change, less susceptibility to toxic chemicals, greater 
flexibility in design and operation.  Generally two type adsorbent uses a). Natural adsorbents b) Prepared activated carbon. © 2021 JETIR March 2021, Volume 8, Issue 3                                                                    www.jetir.org (ISSN -2349 -5162)

 Natural adsorbents used for dye removal such as clay, siliceous materials, zeolites etc.  
Prepared agricultural waste materials used as low cost adsorbent such as orange  peel, banana peel, rice husk, almond 
shell, soybeans husk and coconut shell. There adsorption capacity various factors affecting are adsorbent dosage, contact 
time, PH value, agitation speed, Ionic strength, temperature and initial dye concentration etc.  
 
Chemical method  
Chemical method includes coagulation/flocculants, oxidation, ion -exchange, and neutralization. It involves the 
addition of substances such as aluminium, calcium and ferric ions in to the effluent, as such flocculation. [3].Generally, a 
chemical treatment has feasibility, economic and efficiency, but major drawback is that, the costs of chemical are expensive.  
 
Biological method  
Biological method includes such as activated sludge, anaerobic digestion and aerobic digestion adsorption by (livi ng 
order) microbial biomass, fungal decolonization, and microbial degradation. Microorganism such as fungi, yeast, bacteria 
and algae are able to accumulate dye and degrade different pollution [4]. Biological treatment may be aerobic and anaerobic. 
But the  major drawback is that required large land area and high construction cost.Table1gives advantage end disadvantage 
of dye removal methods

Classif ication of Dye  
Mainly dyes are two types  
1. Natural Dye  
2. Synthetic Dye.  
 
Natural Dye  
Natural dyes are organic compounds used to colour various products. In Prior to the year of 1856, natural dyes are 
extracted from plants, animals, insects and minerals  sources. Natural dyes are such as Turmeric, Weld, Onion, Jackfruit, 
henna, eucalyptus are used in the early textile industry. Due to the increase in population and industrial activities, natura l 
dyes do not meet the industrial demand and their application s have  
 
Synthetic Dye  
The first synthesis dye was discovered by William Henry Per -kin in 1856. Dye effluents are produced because dyes 
do not have a complete degree of fixation to fiber during dyeing and finishing processes[5].Dye based effluents can cause  
a serious hazards to the water stream and environment due to their synthetic origin and complex moleculear structures 
which decrease their ability to biodegrade. There are various types of dyes used in various industries such as acid dyes, 
reactive dyes, basic dyes, azo dyes, direct dyes, vat dyes and disperse dyes [6]. All dyes are water soluble except disperse 
dyes and vat dyes .All dyes contain traces of metals such as copper, zinc, lead, chromium and cobalt in their aqueous 
solution except vat and disp erse dyes. Dye bearing effluents from these industries are characterized by its high colour, 
organic content and hazardous as well. It is estimated that more than100, 000 commercial dyes are known with an annual 
production of more than 7 x 105 tonnes per y ear [2].Dyes are broadly classified into cationic, anionic and non -ionic dyes. No. Methods  Advantages  Disadvantages

 Desiccation & Result  
Factors Affecting Adsorption of Dye  
There are many factors affecting dye adsorption such as solution pH, temperature, initial dye concentration, etc. 
Thus, the effects of these parameters are to be taken into account. Optimization of such conditions will greatly h elp in the 
development of industrial -scale dye removal treatment process. In this section, some of the factors affecting adsorption 
of dyes are discussed below:  
 
   Effect of solution pH  
One of the most important factors affecting the capacity of adsorbent  in wastewater treatment is solution pH. The 
efficiency of adsorptions dependent on the solution pH, since variation in pH leads to the variation in the degree of 
ionization of the adsorptive molecule and the surface properties of adsorbent [7].[8] studied  the effect of solution pH on 
the adsorption of Basic Green4dye by An anscomosus leaf powder and they noticed that at a pH range from 2 to 10, the 
dye removal ratio was maximum at a pH 10.[9] studied the effect of solution pH on the adsorption of Congo red  by pine 
cone and they noticed that the adsorption was maximum at pH of 3.5.[10] studied the adsorption of RB4 dye by modified 
barley straw and they found that RB4 gives a complete removal of 100% at pH of 3 and decreased value below 50% as 
the pH was incr eased.[11] reported that adsorption of cationic dye MB onto raw pine leaves biomass was increased with 
increase In solution pH (Figure1). Table 4 reported the compilation of different studies on the effect of solution pH on 
dye adsorption.  
                                        
 
           Fig.1 Effect of initial solution pH on the adsorption of Methylene Blue (MB) on pine leaves [11]  
 
The adsorption ability of the surface and the type of surface active centers are indicated by the significant factor 
that is the point of zero charge (pH pzc) [12]. The pH at which the surface charge is zero is called the point of zero charge 
(pzc) and is typically used to quantify or define the electro kinetic properties of a surface. The value of pH is used to des cribe 
pzc only for systems in which H+/OH−are the potential determining ions. Many researchers studied the point of zero charge 
(pH pzc) of various adsorbents prepared from agricultural solid wastes; in order to underset and the adsorption mechanism. 
Due to presence of functional group such as OH−group, cationic dye adsorption Is favoured at pH> pH pzc, whereas, anionic 
dye adsorption is favoured at pH<pH pzc where  the surface becomes positively charged [12].  
 
  Effect of initial dye concentration  
 The amount of adsorpt ion for dye removals highly dependent on the initial dye concentration. The effect of initial 
dye concentration depends on the immediate relation between the concentration of the dye and the available sites on an 
adsorbent surface. In General, the percenta ge of dye removal decreases with an increase in the initial dye concentration, which 
may be due to the saturation of adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface. On the other hand the increase in initial dye 
concentration will cause an increase in the capaci ty of the adsorbent and this may be due to the high driving force for mass 
transfer at a high initial dye concentration [13 -14] studied the adsorption of Methyl Orange by Chitosan/Alumina interface and 
it was found that when the Methyl Orange concentration  increased from 20 mg/L to 400mg/L, the percentage of dye removal 
decreased from 99.53% to 83.55% with the same MB concentration range. [11] studied the effect of initial dye concentration 
on the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) by pine leaves and they no ticed that as the initial dye concentration increase from10 
to 90 mg/L ,the percentage removal of dye decreased from 96.5 to 40.9% on increasing the initial dye concentration from 10 
to 90 mg/L after 240 minutes. Fig 2 showed that the amount of CR dye adso rption increased with increase initial dye 
concentration.

Fig.1 Effect of Initial Dye concertation (amount of CR dye adsorption increased with increase initial dye concentration.)  
 
Effect of Temperature  
Effect of temperature is another significant physio -chemical process parameter because temperature will change the 
adsorption capacity of the adsorbent [15]. If the amount of adsorption increases with increasing temperature then the 
adsorption Is an endother mic process. This may be due to increasing mobility of the dye molecules and an increase in the 
number of active sites for the adsorption with increasing temperature. Whereas the decrease of adsorption capacity with 
increasing temperature indicates that th e adsorption is an exothermic process. This may be due to increasing temperature 
decrease the adsorptive forces between the dye species and the active sites on the adsorbent surface as a result of decreasin g 
the amount of adsorption [1].  
 
 Effect of Amoun t of Adsorbent  
 Adsorbent dosage is an important process parameter to determine the capacity of an adsorbent for a given amount 
of the adsorbent at the operating conditions. Generally the percentage of dye removal increases with increasing adsorbent 
dosage , where the quantity of sorption sites at the surface of adsorbent will increase by increasing the amount of the adsorbent. 
The effect of adsorbent dosage gives an idea for ability of a dye adsorption to be adsorbed with a smallest amount of adsorbe nt, 
so as to recognize the capability of a dye from an economical point of view [1] Fig 3 presented the effect of doses on the 
removal of acidic and basic dye by tea waste [16].

Various Adsorbents in the removal of Dyes from aqueous Solution  
Activated carbon  
Activated carbon is the most popular for the removal of pollutants from wastewater among allthe sorbent materials 
proposed [17, 18]. In particular,  the effectiveness of adsorption on activated carbons for removal of a large variety of 
dyes from waste water such as made it an ideal alternative to the expensive treatment options[17].However, activated 
carbon possess several disadvantages, it is quite e xpensive ,problem in regeneration, non -selective and ineffective against 
disperse and vat dyes [18]. The use of carbons based on relatively expensive starting materials is also unjustified for most 
pollution control applications [19].This has led many rese archer to search for alternative low cost adsorbents.  
    
   Low Cost Adsorbents for Dyes Removal  
Selection of the precursor for the development of low cost adsorbents depends on many factors. The precursor 
should be freely available, in -expensive and non -hazardous in nature. In recent times, attention has been focused on 
different natural solid, which are able to remove pollutants from contaminated water at low cost. Cost is an important 
parameter for comparing the sorbent materials. In general, a sorbent can be assumed to be “low cost” if It requires little

 processing and is abundant in nature, or waste material from another industry, which has lost its economic or is a by -
product or further processing values. There are many low cost adsorbents that have b een used for the removal of dyes. 
Also certain waste products from industrial and agricultural operations, natural materials and biosorbents represent 
potentially economical alternative sorbents. Many of them have been tested and proposed for dye removal. Waste 
treatment by adsorption using low cost adsorbent is a demanding area as it has double benefits i.e. water treatment and 
west management. Given below table shows example of absorption for removal of dye The use of agricultural waste 
helps tore duce th e waste and produce a better waste minimization plan. Various cost effective adsorbents have 
been successfully used in the removal of textile dyes from.

Conclusion: - 
A review of various type of activated carbon as adsorbent has been presented. The use of thsese activated carbon as 
adsorbent is recommended since they show a good potential in eliminating dyes from industrial wastewater, easily available, 
low cost and renewable. This paper presented the potential of adsorption process using activated carbon from agricultural was te 
to remove dye from textile wastewater. The factors effecting dye adsorption s uch as contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH and 
initial dye concentration has been discussed. Solution of pH turn to be the most important condition in adsorption process as  
for anionic dye, a low pH value are preferable in contrast for cationic dye where th e suitable pH value is high. For the adsorbent 
dose, that the adsorption capacity increase along with the increment of adsorbent dosage due to the increase of available amo unt 
of sorption site. Is was also highlighted that the contact time between adsorben t and dye affecting the efficiency of dye removal 
where strong attraction force will shortened the time. As for the effect of dye initial concentration, increasing the initial  
concentration, enhance The increment of adsorbent surface area to adsorb dyes. E xtensive studies in literature show that 
industrial waste and biosorbent activated carbon are among the less selective compound in removing dye. Furthermore, 
agricultural waste activated carbon showed effectiveness in removing dye such as basic dye and dir ect dye yet often being test 
for other pollutant such as copper II, fluoride and phenol. However, the raw material of activated carbon to be used are depe nds 
on the local sources available at low cost. According to the literature reviewed, these adsorption  method using agricultural 
waste activated carbon have potential to be applied at full -scale wastewater treatment. These low cost adsorbent can used to 
replace the expensive adsorbents in the market nowadays.
