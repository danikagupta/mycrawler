Abstract - Crystal violet belongs to the family of Azo dyes , which are extensively used in textile industries. 
Disposal of dyes in the environment causes damage to the ecosystem and biodiversity. Microbial degradation 
and dec olourization of crystal violet is an eco -friendly and sustainability enhancing process. In the present study, 
crystal violet degrading bacteria were isolated from textile effluent on Nutrient agar amended with the dye. 11 
potent bacterial strains were sele cted, which exhibited the maximum decolourization in 48 hours. Kinetic studies 
were performed to analyse the influence of different dye concentrations, pH and temperature on degradation 
rate, under static conditions. All the 11 bacterial strains could deco lourize 500 µg of crystal violet within 24 
hours and could grow in media containing 1000 µg of crystal violet. Maximum degradation was observed in the 
pH range of 6-9, with optimum temperature as 37°C. The organisms were identified using vitek system and 
were found to be belong ing to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  and Enterobacter cloacae complex . Thus, the 
study emphasizes the potential role of microbes for rapid and efficient  degradation of azo dye, thus also aiding 
safe discharge of textile effluent.  
Key words  - Crystal violet, Azo dye, dye degrading bacteria, textile effluent , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia ,

I. INTRODUCTION  
 
Over the last few decades, globalization and industrialization ha ve drastically increased , which has led to an 
increase in environmental pollution. Among various industries, the textile dying industries discharge a large 
volume of waste water after  the dyeing process [M. Sudha et al, 2014]. It is estimated that around 10 -15% of 
the dyes are lo st in the effluent during the dyeing processes [M. Sudha et al, 2014]. This wastewater contains 
different types of dyes , such as azo, diazo, acidic, reactive, basic, disperse, anthraquinone dyes.  
Crystal violet is a type of azo dye that is extensively used  in the textile industr y. It is a cationic dye, also known 
as hexamethyl pararosaniline chloride , with the molecular formula C 25H30N3Cl [Chung et al.  1983 ]. It also has 
extensive applications  in human and veterinary medicine as a biological stain [ S. Adeeb Mujtaba Ali et  al, 
2014 ]. Azo dyes have a synthetic origin and a complex aromatic structure (N=N group). Depending upon the 
number of azo -groups, azo dyes are divided into monazo, disazo, trisazo, tetrakisazo and polyazo. These dyes 
account for aroun d 60-70% of all dyes used in food and textile manufacture [ Saratale et al., (2013), S. Kannan 
et al, 2013].  
Discharge of crystal violet and other azo dyes  in the environment causes serious health and environmental 
problems. It may affect photosynthetic ac tivity in aquatic life by reducing light penetration. This also alters the 
pH, increases the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), and gives the rivers 
intense colourations [S. Kannan et al, 2013]. It greatly affects the water q uality. The high concentration of dyes

 is known to cause ulceration of the skin, and mucous membrane, dermatitis, perforation of the nasal septum, 
severe irritation of the respiratory tract and on ingestion may cause vomiting, pain, haemorrhage , and sharp 
diarrhoea [C. Lavanya et al., 2014].  
Various physico -chemical methods are employed for the decolourization of azo dyes. Although they can remove 
dyes partially, various limitations prevent them to be economical and thus cannot be used widely and 
economically [S. Kannan et al, 2013]. Biologica l methods have  gained more attention recently because they are 
eco-friendly and economically feasible. A number of microorganisms have been found to be able to decolourize 
textile dyes , including bacteria, fungi, and yeasts [S. Kannan et al, 2013].  Bacteria capable of dye decolorization, 
either in pure cultures or in consortia, have been reported [Telke  et al. 2008; Kalyani et al. 2009 ]. Bacterial azo 
dye biodegradation proceeds in two stages. The first stage involves reductive cleavage of the dyes , azo linkages, 
resulting in the formation of generally colourless  but potentially hazardous aromatic amines. The second stage 
involves degradation of the aromatic amines. Azo dye reduction usually requires anaerobic conditions, whereas 
bacterial biodegradat ion of aromatic amines is an almost exclusively aerobic process [Alabdraba et al.,2014].  
Enzymes cataly zing azo dye reduction may either be specialized enzymes (catalysing only the reduction of azo 
dyes) or non -specialized enzymes (non -specific enzymes tha t catalyze the reduction of a wide range of 
compounds ). The predominant enzymes are azoreductase, laccases, lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, 
and hydroxylases.  
The present study focused on isolation and screening of degraders from dye textile efflue nt for decolourizing 
crystal violet (Azo dye) and optimize various parameters to maximiz e the decolourization.  
 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Sample collection and screening for dye degraders: A textile dye effluent sample was collected in a clean 
container from Genesis Industry, Tarapur, Maharashtra. The effluent was used to carry out enrichment in the 
nutrient broth method containing 10 ppm of crystal violet. After enrichment of 15 days the broth was cultivated 
on the n utrient agar medium amended with 30  ppm crystal violet dye and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The 
bacterial colonies which exhibited decolourizing ability were chosen for further studies . More such studies were 
carried out with 100 ppm and 500 ppm of crystal violet. Thus, 11 isolates that gave the best degradation at 500 
ppm concentration of crystal violet after 48 hours were screened and selected for kinetics study.  
Kinetic Stud ies 
Effect of dye concentration:  To determine the effect of different concentrations of crystal violet dye 
decolouriza tion, nutrient broth media was amended with different concentrations of crystal violet to get a final 
concentration of 500, 750 and 1000  ppm.  The inoculated media in the flasks were  incubated for 48hrs at 37°C  
and degradation activity was analysed  [S. Kan nan et. al., 2013] . 
Effect of pH:  The pH of nutrient broth media was adjusted to 4, 6, 7.4 and 9 and then further inoculated with 
test strains to study its effect on decolourization of crystal violet (500 ppm concentration) at 37°C for 48 hrs [S. 
Kannan et.  al., 2013] . 
 Effect of temperature:  To study the effect of temperature on decolourization of crystal violet dye, the  nutrient 
broth  media containing  500 ppm concentration  of crystal violet  was inoculated with test strains at room 
temperature  and 37°C for 48 hrs [S. Kannan et. al., 2013] .        
Decolourization assay:  The analysis of the crystal violet dye degradation by test strains was carried out by 
absorption studies , which indicated the decolourization of the dye in the broth. To quantify the decoloriz ation 
rate under different environmental conditions , the samples after 24 hours and 48 hours of incubation were 
withdrawn and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected (diluted if required) and was 
read at 540 nm (maximum wavelengt h) by colorimeter  [S. Kannan et. al., 2013] . The percentage of 
decolorization was calculated by the formula -   
Percent Decolourization = (Initial absorbance value –Final absorbance value / Initial absorbance value) × 100.   
Identification of the dye degrade rs: Identification of the dye degraders was done by VITEK METHOD and 
by studying the morphological characteristics.         © 2024 JETIR August 2024, Volume 11, Issue 8                                                             www.jetir.org  (ISSN -2349 -5162 )

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Screening for potent  strain s will be beneficial to treat waste water from  textile industries . In the current  study, 
the agar plate assay was carried out to detect the decolorization activity of the enriched strains obtained from 
textile waste water sample s. The pure cultures of the 11 isolates were selected as test strains  on the basis of their 
dye degradation a bility on  nutrient agar plates amended with 500 ppm of crystal violet (fig. 1).

The broth assay was carried out to detect the optimum conditions for decolorization by the test strains . The 
culture suspensions of the selected 11 isolates  (O.D. 0.1 at 540nm)  were inoculated into the nutrient broth 
containing varying concentrations of crystal violet (500, 700 and 1000 ppm) and incubated appropriately for 
degradation assay studies. After 48-hour incubation , the media samples were collected, centrifuged , and their 
optical density was measured at 540 nm. The decolorization  percentage  was calculated and the graphs were 
plotted.  
All the 11 isolates could decolourize crystal violet in a concentr ation range of 500 ppm to 1000 ppm.  Maximum 
decolorization was observed at 500 ppm of crystal violet by  all isolates .  A maximum decolorization percentage 
of 99.24% was observed within 48 hours by isolate 5 , followed by 97.72 by isolate 2. All the 11 isolates could 
decolourize dye concentration s of 1000 ppm in 48 hours. The m aximum decolorization of the crystal violet dye 
was exhibited by isolate 11  (51.40%  degradation), within 48 hours. The decolorization ab ilities of 
microorganisms can be enhanced by gradually exposing them to higher concentrations of synthetic organic 
chemicals. The adaptation of microorganisms to toxic and high concentration compound s was  found to be 
improving the rate of decolorization. F rom a previous study, it was found that the bacterial dye degraders could 
decolourize 97.12% dye of 300 ppm concentration in 24 hours [S. Kannan et. al., 2013]. Comparatively, from 
the present study, a degradation of 99.24% was observed for 500  ppm concent ration in 48 hours.

A pH range of 4 to 9 was used for  the kinetic study. Optimum pH for all isolates was found to be in the range 
of pH 6 -7.4. The decolorization activity showed a decrease at pH below 6 or above 8. However, the degradation 
activity being functional at both acidic and alkaline pH indicated the capability of the organisms to carry out 
degradation in diverse condition s. Similar re sults were observed in previous studies reported.  The optimal pH

 for dye degradation was found to be  between 6.0 and 10.0 [Chen, et al., 200 7]. In another study,  the maximum 
decolorization of azo dye was achieved at pH 7.0 with 93.23%  degradation  in 48 hou rs [S. Kannan, et al., 2013].

The degradation of crystal violet was more efficient at 37℃  in comparison  to room temperature. However , the 
difference was not statistically significant  (p-value >0.05) . The organisms were identified using the vitek system 
and were found to be belonging to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  and Enterobacter cloacae complex . 
IV.  CONCLUSION  
The isolation of efficient dye decolourizing bacteria from the textile effluent water directs the natural adaptation 
of the microorganisms to survive in the presence of toxic dyes. Since these microorganisms do not need any 
addition al requirement s for adaptation in the presence of toxic dyes , they are beneficial in  the treatment of textile 
effluent . All the 11 isolates could decolourize the dye efficiently up to 1000 PPM concentration in 48 hours 
under optimum static aerobic conditions , indicating that further studies can be carried out to build a robust 
consortia of dye degraders . Thus,  it can be concluded that these isolates can be used for effective biological 
treatment of textile effluent.
