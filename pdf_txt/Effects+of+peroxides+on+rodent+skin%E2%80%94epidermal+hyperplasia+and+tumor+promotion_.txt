Effects of Peroxides on Rodent Skin: Epidermal Hyperplasia and Tumor 
Promotion

Free radical generating peroxides are potent skin ir­
ritants. After a single topical application of either 10, 20, 
or 40 mg of lauroyl peroxide or benzoyl peroxide on the 
dorsal skin of Sencar mice, the epidermal thickness in­
creased markedly. No major inflammatory or vascular 
alterations were noted. On the other hand, 15 or 30% 
hydrogen peroxide produced an extensive epider­
molysis, as well as inflammation and vascular injury, 
followed by quick regeneration and epidermal hyperpla­
sia. 
Both lauroyl peroxide- and benzoyl peroxide-induced 
hyperplasias were characterized by a sustained produc­
tion of dark basal keratinocytes, which constituted ap­
proximately 10% of the basal cell population during the 
first week after single topical application . Hydrogen per­
oxide-induced epiderma14yperplasias also exhibited nu­
merous dark cells, but their presence was less sustained. 
Although all these peroxides were inactive either as 
initiators or as complete carcinogens, lauroyl peroxide 
was as effective as benzoyl peroxide when used as a skin 
tumor promoter in a' two-stage carcinogenesis protocol. 
In a similar experimental protocol, hydrogen peroxide 
proved to be a very weak skin tumor promoter. 
Hydrogen peroxide (H202), lauroyl peroxide (LP), and ben­
zoyl peroxide (BP) are free radical generating compounds 
widely used in the chemical industry, especially BP in phar­
maceutical preparations. Although earlier studies showed that 
peroxides are not carcinogenic when applied topically on the 
mouse skin [lJ, if these compounds are used undiluted or in 
high concentrations they are potent skin irritants [2,3], Re­
cently we have confirme d that BP is not a complete carcinogen, 
but it is a very effective tumor promoter if repetitively applied 
after a subcarcinogenic dose of dimethyl benzanthracene 
(DMBA) in a two-stage carcinogenesis protocol [4]. In addition, 
as has been seen with many other skin tumor promoters, BP 
induces a large number of dark basal keratinocytes, i.e., in­
tensely basophilic or electron dense cells [4]. In other published 
experiments we have shown that after topical application of 
several promoters and hyperplasiogenic agents the number of 
induced dark basal keratinocytes correlates well with the re­
spective tumor-promoting efficiencies of these agents [5-7]. The 
purpose of this study is to show the morphological changes 
induced by peroxides in skin, especially epideJ;maJ hyperplasia

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Animals 
Sencar mice originally obtained from Dr. R K. Boutwell, Madison, 
Wis., are presently raised in Oak Ridge, TellO, as previously described 
[8]. Female animals 7 to 9 weeks of age, were shaved with surgical 
clippers 2 days before treatment, and only those in the resting phase of 
the hair cycle were used. 
Morphological Studies 
A total of 132 animals were treated with BP or LP in acetone or with 
H202• Using 16 to 21 animals per group, BP and LP were used in 3 
different doses, i.e., 10, 20, and 40 mg in 0.2 ml acetone. I-L02 was 
applied either as a concentrated solution (30%) or diluted 1:1 and 1:5 in 
acetone. The 0.2-ml solution containing the peroxides was applied 
topically on the dorsal skin. Except for the LP treatments, in which 
due to the low solubility of the compound 10 mg were applied in 0.2 1111 
2 or 4 times to give a total dosage of 20 and 40 mg, respectively, in aU 
other treatments a single topical application of 0.2 ml of solution 
containing the peroxide dose was applied topically on the dorsal skin. 
A group of 12 control animals were treated with acetone alone. 
Following a single application, 2-4 animals were sacrificed 1, 2, 4, 6, 
8, and 10 days after treatment. After excision of 1 cm2 of treated skin, 
I-mm thick blocks were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M sym­
collidine buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 hI' at 4°C. After washing the tissues in 0.1 
M sodium cacodylate solution, the tissues were postfixed in 2% osmium 
tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, dehydrated, and embedded in 
Epon 812. One micron-thick sections were prepared and stained with 
toluidine blue as previously described [5]. The number of darkly stained 
basal cells and the total number of basal cells were counted in 1-2 
blocks for each treated animal. A total of 10,212 cells were counted. In 
the same blocks, epidermal thickness measw'ed randomly at 10 different 
sites of the interfollicular epidermis per block was determined . Ultra­
thin sections were also prepared as previously described [5J, stained 
with uranyl acetate and lead' citrate, and observed in a Hitachi HUllB 
electron microscope. 
Carcinogenesis Studies 
The tumor-promoti ng, tumor-initiating, and complete carcinogenic 
activities of H20. and LP were investigated in the dorsal skin of 780 
animals. Thirty (LP) or 60 (H202) Sencar mice were used in each 
experimental group. In order to test the tumor-promoting activity of 
the compound, the animals received 10 nmoles of DMBA in 0.2 ml 
acetone or acetone only as control, followed 1 week later by twice­
weekly topical applications of various dose levels of either H202 or LP 
in 0.2 rnI acetone for 25 weeks. The tumor-initiating abilities of the 
peroxides were determined by applying either l,h02 (diluted 1:1 in 
acetone) or 20 mg LP in 0.2 ml acetone or acetone only as control, and 
promoted 1 week later with twice-weekly applications of 2 p.g 12-0-
tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13 -acetate (TPA) for 25 weeks. The complete 
caJ'cinogenic activity of the peroxides was studied by performing twice­
weekly topical applications of H202 (diluted in acetone 1:1) or 20 mg 
LP in.0.2 ml acetone, or acetone only as a control, for 25 weeks. 
RESULTS

BP and LP proved to be epidermal hyperplasiogeni c agents. 
BP (10 mg) produced very slight or no response (Fig 1) in the July 1982 EFFECTS OF PEROXIDES ON RODENT SKIN: EPIDERMAL HYPERPLASIA AND TUMOR PROMOTION 31

cutaneous tissues. Twenty and 40 mg elicited a marked and 
similar epidermal hyperplasia (Figs 2 and 3), starting 48 hr after 
topical application of the compounds. This was chm'acterized 
by acanthosis with hyperorthokeratinization. The maximum 
epidermal thickness (Table I) was reached 4 days after the 
topical application; it decreased thereafter (Fig 4) and attained 
almost normal values after 10 days (Fig 5). LP induced similar, 
although less marked, alterations, i.e. practically no changes 
were observed with 10 mg, whereas a mild hyperplasia was seen 
with the higher doses. The pattern of epidermal thickness 
variations offered some differences (Table I), i.e., the maximum 
epidermal hyperplasia was reached at 2 days, and, with slight 
variation, was maintained for the fIrst week. The maximum 
thickness reached was lower than the one attained with similar 
doses of BP. Neither of these compounds produced more than 
slight inflammatory or vascular alteration s in the dermis.

H202 showed a very different effect. Although H202 diluted 
1:5 exhibited practically no effect, both the concentrated solu­
tion (30%) and the 1:1 (15%) dilution produced an intense 
reaction with extensive necrosis of the epidermis which was 
seen sloughing off in toto as early as 24 hr after application (Fig 
6). Some basal cells remained attached to the basement mem­
brane and were seen to proliferate and regenerate the epidermis 
(Fig 7). In addition, cells migrating from the infundibular por­
tion of the hair follicles also contributed to the epiderma l 
regeneration (Fig 6). Areas of marked hyperplasia were seen 4 
and 6 days after topical application of either 15 or 30% H202 
(Fig 8 and 9, Table 1). Although some hyperplastic foci re­
mained at 8 and 10 days, overall the epidermis reverted to its 
normal thickness (Fig 10). During the first 4 days after H202 
application and coinciding with the extensive erosion and/or 
ulceration of the epidermis, an intense leukocytic infIltration of 
the dermis was observed. Many hair follicles were lethally 
damaged, exhibiting necrotic cells and several involutional 
changes (absence of mitosis, atrophy, shortening of the follicle 
and disappearance with granulation tissue replacement). Al­
though the blood vessels were apparently normal at the light 
microscopy level, marked involutional changes were seen with 
the electron microscope in the endothelial cells (Fig 11) fre­
quently accompanied by microthrombi. These vascular changes 
were not seen in the BP-and LP-treated skins. 
Of particular interest was the presence of dark basal keratin­
ocytes in the l-/Lm thick sections stained with toluidine blue. 
Both LP-and BP-treated epidermis exhibited an increase of 
dark cells which constituted approximately 10% (a five-fold 
increase from the normal value of 2%) of the basal cell popula­
tion 2 to 4 days after treatment. At 6 and 8 days the percentage 
decreased to approximately 7%, returning to control values by 
day 10. No dose response could be seen (Fig 12). 
After H202 treatment the percentage of dark keratinocytes 
reached a maximum somewhat later (6 days). Although this 
later peak was of the same order of magnitude as the ones 
observed with either BP or LP, the total amount of dark cells 
induced by H202 during the entire experimenta l period was 
markedly lower than the total number of dark cells induced 
with either of the other peroxides. 
Carcinogenesis Studies 
The skin tumor induction studies carried out with LP are 
described in Table II. LP was an efficient skin tumor promoter 
when applied repetitively after initiation with DMBA. Even 
low promoting doses of 1 mg twice weekly for 25 weeks produced 
papillomas in 25% of the animals. A clear dose response was 
observed when other doses were employed (43 and 66% of the 
experimental animals showed tumors, using 10 and 20 mg, 
respectively). LP was not effective as a complete carcinogen

and was not able to induce tumor formation when used as an 
initiator followed by repetitive application of TP A. 
H202 was also ineffective as an initiator or as a complete 
carcinogen but, in contrast to LP, was an extremely weak 
promoter (Table III). 
DISCUSSION 
Although the importance of free radicals in radiation and 
chemical carcinogenesis has been suggested [9-12], both LP 
and BP failed to effectively produce skin tumors in a series of 
experiments carried out almost two decades ago [1]. Recently 
we have demonstrate d that although BP is ineffective either as 
an initiator or as a complete carcinogen, it is a potent tumor 
promoter [4]. 
In the present report we have described analagous properties 
of LP. On the other hand, H202 did not show strong tumor­
promoting capacity. 
Free radical producing peroxides have been described as 
strong skin irritants [2,3]. H202, especially in concentrated solutions, is extremely toxic and we were able to produce 
massive epidermal necrosis accompanied by extensive endothe­
lial damage of the dermal blood vessels. Neither BP nor LP has 
shown similar properties at the dosages used. Although the 
toxicity of H202 could account for the lack of promoting effi­
ciency of undiluted or highly concentrated H202 solutions, 
because of a destruction of initiated epidermal cells, this does 
not adequately explain the lack of promoting ability of the 1:5 
diluted solution which does not produce extensive epidermal 
necrosis. On the other hand, the diluted solutions of H202 
neither produce epidermal hyperplasia nor induce the forma­
tion of dark basal cells. The more concentrated solutions do 
produce hyperplasia and induce dark keratinocytes , but these 
phenomena are part of a regenerative effort following extensive 
epidermal necrosis. It is possible that repetitive treatments with 
concentrated H202 solutions, although having tumor-promoting 
capacity, are too toxic to permit the survival of a large popula­
tion of initiated cells, whereas the low concentration solutions 
are too weak to unfold the necessary proliferative reactions 
which accompany and probably are necessary for tumor pro­
motion. In addition, cellular catalase and glutathione peroxi­
dase, which can detoxify intracellular H202 and other hydro­
peroxides [13], may prevent some of the intracellular effects of 
these agents which may be necessary for tumor promotion. In 
preliminary experiments, we have found that tert-butyl hydJ·o­
peroxide, like H202, is a very weak tumor promoter and a potent 
epidermal hyperplasiogenic agent. Glutathione peroxidase can 
effectively use H202 and other hydJ-operoxides as a substrate 
but not LP (dilamoyl peroxide) and other dialkyl peroxides 
[14]. Free radicals generated by hydroperoxides and dialkyl 
peroxides may cause lipid peroxidation in the plasma membran e 
which may cause the epidermal hyperplasia . Once these per­
oxides enter the cell the hydro peroxides are rapidly detoxified, 
whereas dialkyl peroxides are not; thus the free radicals gener­
ated may have additional effects, such as DNA damage, which 
might also be necessary for tumor promotion [14]. 
Raick [15-16] has shown that potent tumor promoters induce 
dark basal keratinocytes in the epidermis. In recent reports we 
have described a good correlation between the percentag e of 
dark basal keratinocytes and the promoting efficiency of hyper­
plasiogenic compounds [5-7]. In the present report we describe 
a five-fold increase (10%) in the percentage of dark basal cells 
induced by both LP and BP 2 to 4 days after topical application , 
as well as a sustained three-to fom-fold increase which is seen 
throughout the first 6 days after treatment. This is accompanied 
by a very early epidermal hyperplasia. On the other hand, H202, 
although also inducing a large number of dark cells, exhibits a 
less sustained effect with a later peak of 10% at day 6 and 
markedly lower values before and after this maximum. It has 
to be noted that H20z produces a marked destruction of the 
epidermis, followed by a relatively late (6 days) regenerative 
hyperplasia, which also peaks 6 days after topical application. 
In conclusion, the early changes induced by single application 
of LP and BP, i.e., early epidennal hyperplasia and especially 
the sustained induction of dark keratinocytes, tend to correlate 
well with their respective relatively potent tumor-promoting 
abilities. .

Since epidermal Langerhans cells share many of the 
surface marker characteristics and functions of cells of 
the monocyte-macrophage series, we sought to deter­
mine whether Langerhans cells, like macrophages, pro­
duce Interleukin 1 (IL-l), formerly called lymphocyte 
activating factor. Heterogenous suspensions of murine 
epidermal cells were cultured for 3 days with or without 
various stimulants and their cell-free supernatants were 
tested for IL-l activity in a thymocyte proliferation as­
say. Significant augmentation of lectin induced thymo­
cyte proliferation was produced by the supernatants of 
these cultures. However, when epidermal cells were de­
pleted of Langerhans cells by treating with anti-Ia anti­
serum and complement, the supernatants still produced 
significant augmentation. As the augmenting activity

dermal cells, but significantly more was produced by 
epidermal cells that were incubated with phorbol myr­
istic acetate, a low molecular weight tumor promoting 
agent or muramyl dipeptide, the synthetic analog of the 
cell wall of mycobacterium smegmatis . ET AF production 
was reduced by X-irradiatiQn and was completely abol­
ished when protein synthesis was inhibited. The molec­
ular weight of this factor was approximately 15,000 dal­
ton, which is similar to the molecular weight of macro­
phage derived IL-I; its heat stability and pH stability 
were similar to that of IL-I. ETAF, like IL-l also en­
hanced lymphocyte production of Interleukin 2 (IL-2). 
The data indicate that epidermal cells, devoid of Langer­
hans cells, are capable of producing factors with IL-I 
like activity and may thereby modulate immune re­
sponses locally in the skin and perhaps systemically . 
The role of the macrophage in T-cell activation is mediate d 
in part by a 12,000 to 16,000 molecular weight factor called 
lymphocyte activating factor or Interleukin 1 (IL-1) [1-8]. IL-l 
is capable of enhancing lectin-induced DNA synthesis in thy­
mocytes [5,9] and appears to be involved in peripheral helper 
T cell activation [1-3]. Macrophages produce IL-l in response 
to a wide variety of stimuli including endotoxin, phorbol esters, 
lectin-activated T cells and lymphokines [9-12]. In view of the 
relationship between certain macrophages and epidermal Lan­
gerhans cells (LC) (e.g., both bear receptors for the Fc portion 
of IgG and for C3b, synthesize and express Ia antigens, present
