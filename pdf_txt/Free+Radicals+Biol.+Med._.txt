ABSTRACT                        Since metals are cable of catalysing the free radical reactions, different metal(Mg, Mn, Zn) compounds were studied to determine their hydroxyl radical generating and/orscavenging abilities depending on ligand in a H
2O2/•OH -luminol system with or without
microperoxidase. Magnesium oxide, magnesium gluconate and manganese gluconate increasethe free radical reactions in the H
2O2/•OH -luminol system. Most of examined metal compounds
have different hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in H2O2/•OH- microperoxidase -luminol
system.  Magnesium citrate has the highest antioxidant effect, while manganese compoundsseem to be prooxidant. Vitamin E and C elevate the free radical level in this experimentalsystem.

107In living organisms free radical formation and the free radical
defense system are closely related to metal ions and com-plexes (Tampo and Yonaha 1992; Sigel and Sigel 1999).Fenton reaction describes Fe(II) induced hydroxyl radicalformation (Fenton 1894, Haber and Willstätter 1931, Haberand Weiss 1934) and other transition metal ions (
e.g. V , Cr)
take part in Fenton-like reactions (Halliwell and Gutteridge1990; Goldstein et al. 1993). Nevertheless, none transitionmetal ions also play a significant role, directly or indirectly,in free radical reactions. For example manganese, zinc andcopper have a role in the antioxidant defense system(Zidenberger-Cherr and Keen 1991; Ebadi et al. 1996) andmagnesium is present in every cell membrane in membraneATP-ase and magnesium activates several enzymes whichcatalyse polyphosphate hydrolysis (Fox et al. 2001).
In the diseases where metal ion supplementation is
neccessery, it is important to know the complex form (ligand)of the metal. The absorption of metal and other physico-chemical properties can change, depending on the ligand(Hallberg et al. 1970; Kaltwasser et al. 1987; Rauch et al.1990; Szentmihályi et al. 1998) and the physiological effectof the metal compound varies depending on the ligand aswell.
Therefore, the hydroxyl radical generating ability and
scavenging activity of some metal (Mg, Mn, Zn) compoundswere studied by chemiluminescence method in the H
2O2-
luminol system with or without microperoxidase.Materials and Methods
The weight ratio of vitamin E to vitamin C was 1:2, and thatof vitamins to metals was 2:1 in the experimental system.Concentrations of the metal compounds in the basic solutionswere 1 mg/ml. The compounds examined were of phar-macopoeal quality. Since the result is matrix dependent, themeasurements were always made under same conditions(temperature, pH, concentration ratios).
Chemiluminescence techniques were applied for the
studying of metal catalysis or scavenger activity. Lightemission of luminol was measured by a method of Blázovicset al. (1999) using a Berthold Lumat LB-9501 luminometer.The intensity of chemiluminescence light is given as therelative light unit (RLU).
The reaction mixture for measuring free radical gener-
ating ability was as follows: hydrogen peroxide (10
4  dilution)
300 µl, luminol (7x10-7 M) 100 µl, the sample (1 mg metal
compound/ml solution) 50 µl and bidistilled water 250 µl.
The reaction mixture for measuring the hydroxyl scav-
enging activity was: hydrogen peroxide (104  dilution) 300 µl,
microperoxidase (3x10-7 M) 300 µl, luminol (7x10-7 M) 50 µl
and the sample (1mg/ml ) 100 µl diluted with bidestilled
water to 1 ml. The intensity of chemiluminescence light isgiven as the relative light unit (RLU) reduced by free radicalscavenging substances.
Results and Discussion
Since the decomposition of luminol in the presence ofhydrogen peroxide is catalysed by metal ions, some metalcompounds were investigated for the catalytic activity of thereaction.108Szentmihályi et al.
In the applied system and concentrations neither vitamins
nor metal compounds (except for magnesium oxide, mag-nesium gluconate and manganese gluconate) generated thedecomposition of luminol to aminophtalate in H
2O2/•OH-
luminol system (Table 1). When we applied the microperox-idase in the system (H
2O2/•OH-microperoxidase-luminol)
different metal compounds have different radical scavengingactivity (Table 2). The metal ions, depending on the qualityof the metal, ligand and concentration, may induce freeradicals. Among magnesium compounds, only magnesiumcitrate has significant scavenging activity whereas othermagnesium compounds enhance the free radical level for-mation. None of the manganese compounds have hydroxylradical scavenging activity, while zinc compounds (except forzinc chloride) show scavenging activity. The mixture ofvitamin E and C in the applied concentration has only a weakscavenging activity in this system.
The presence of vitamin E and C in the metal ion-
containing solution changes the free radical scavengingactivity. The vitamins increased the relative light unit (RLU%) of the system (H
2O2/•OH-microperoxidase-luminol)
together with magnesium sulfate, zinc sulfate and zincgluconate solutions, while decreased free radical formationtogether with magnesium gluconate, manganese sulfate andmanganese gluconate solutions (Table 3).
 According to the results it has been stated that chemi-
luminescence measurement is an efficient method for thedetermination of free radical generating or scavengingactivity of metal compounds as well.
