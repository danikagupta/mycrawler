 2 Abstract    
The redox reaction betwee n hexacyanoferrate(II) ion as the  reducing  agent and hydrogen 
peroxide as the oxidizing one, in slightly acid (pH 4.36
− 6.65) aqueous solutions containing 
phosphate ions, has been studied by means of an  UV-Vis spectrophotometer mon itoring the 
formation of Fe(III) at 420 nm. The initial hydrolysis of the Fe(II) -cyanide complex reactant 
to yield a pentacyanoaquaferrate(II) intermediate, as well as an increase in the solution pH 
(acid catalysis), had both a positive effect on the react ion rate, whereas an increase in the 
concentrations of Fe(III), phosphate and chloride ions, and D -mannitol had a negative effect 
(inhibition). A computer program, specifically designed for this purpose, allowed arriving at a 
complex eight -coefficient expe rimental rate law by application of the initial rate method, 
accounting for the dependences of the reaction rate on the concentrations of Fe(II), H 2O2 and 
Fe(III). The reaction was characterized by a low value of the apparent activation energy ( 28.9 
± 2.7 kJ mol-1) and a very negative value of the activation entropy (
− 165 ± 9 J K-1 mol-1). 
Finally, a multi -step reaction mechanism , involving the participation of a penta -coordinated 
Fe(II) complex and three free radicals (hydroperoxyl , superoxide and hydroxyl) as 
intermediates, has been proposed. This mechanism was supported by the available 
experimental information and confirmed by numerical simulations performed via the fourth -
order Runge -Kutta integration method.

 3 Introduction  
 
According to the free radical theory of aging  [1], a plausible mechanism for this phenomenon 
involves the participation of oxygen -containi ng free radicals in the formation of deleterious 
defects that would progressively accumulate inside the cells of aerobic organisms. Other non -
radical reactive oxygen species generated in the normal metabolism would include hydrogen 
peroxide.  
The reduction  of molecular oxygen to water follows the well -known half reaction:  
 
 
22+O  +  4H + 4e 2H O           −⎯⎯ →      (1) 
 
However, it is estimated that around 2% of the oxygen consumed suffers a monoelectronic 
reduction instead  [2
−4], thus initi ating the s equence:  
 
 
 
  
2 2 2 2 2 ++2H 2He e e eO O H O HO + HO 2H O               . .− − − −−−⎯⎯ → ⎯⎯⎯ → ⎯⎯ → ⎯⎯⎯ →    (2) 
 
and leading to the formation of three potentially damaging reactive oxygen species: 
superoxide ion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical  [5]. Among them, the latter, because 
of its role as an initi ator of a cascade of deleterious chain reactions  [6], is indeed the most 
harmful metabolite for aerobes, especially as far as DNA alteration is concerned  [7, 8] , and it 
may be implicated in aging, carcinogenesis and other degenerative diseases  [9, 10] . 
Although the main chemical agents able to reduce hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radical 
under physiological conditions are thought to be transition -metal ions in their lower oxidation  
 
 
 
 
 
 4 states  [11], especially Fe(II) and Cu(I) in their protein -bounded forms  [12
− 14], some authors 
(belonging to the field of chemistry rather than to that of biology) have openly opposed this 
interpretation, favoring either an Fe(IV) or a Cu(III) non -radical mechanism instead  [15
− 26]. 
This has resulted in a certain polemic, since other authors favor the hydroxyl -based 
mechanism  [27
− 33]. The resolution of this question is indeed of some importance because, 
on the contrary, the very own free radical theory of a ging would be under jeopardy.  
Given that iron(II) and iron(III) salts are water insoluble in neutral media due to the 
precipitation of the corresponding hydroxides, the kinetic study of their reactions with 
hydrogen peroxide under biologically relevant con ditions makes mandatory the use of 
adequate metal -ligand complexes as an alternative  [34
− 38]. In particular, the oxidation of 
hexacyanoferrate(II) ion by hydrogen peroxide has previously received some attention, the 
analysis of it s kinetic behavior having been reported to be considerably hampered by 
reproducibility problems  [39]. Other authors have found a simple first -order dependence on 
the concentration of the reducing agent and a more complex (Michaelis -Menten -like) 
dependence on that of the oxidizing agent, as well as acid catalysis  [40]. The finding that the 
hexacyanoferrate(II) -hydrogen peroxide mixtures cause the hydroxylation of the naturally -
occurring aromatic oil guaiacol ( o-methoxyphenol) seems to suggest the participati on of 
hydroxyl radicals as reaction intermediates  [41]. On the other hand, the reaction object of the 
present research has been reported to be complex enough to produce pH oscillations when 
carried out in water -acetonitrile mixtures under closed -system con ditions  [42], making the 
study of its kinetics particularly attractive.  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 5 Experimental   
 
Materials and methods  
 
All the experiments were done using as solvent water previously purified by deionization 
followed by treatment with a  Millipore Synergy UV sys tem (milli -Q quality,  = 0.05 S/cm 
at 25.0 ºC). The reactants r equired to carry out the redox reaction were potassium 
hexacyanoferrate(II) trihydrate,  K4 [Fe(CN) 6]·3H2O (Merck) , as reducing agent and hydrogen 
peroxide, H 2O2  (Sigma -Aldrich) , as oxidizing  agent. Other chemicals used were potassium 
hexacyanoferrate(III),  K3 [Fe(CN) 6] (Merck) , to study the autoinhibition caused by one of the 
reaction products, potassium dihydrogenphosphate, KH 2PO 4, and dipotassium 
hydrogenphosphate trihydrate, K 2HPO 4·3H2O (both Merck), to control the medium pH, 
potassium chloride, KCl (Merck), as an inert electrolyte to determine a potential ionic strength 
effect, and 1,2,3,4,5,6 -hexanehexol, CH 2OH-(CHOH) 4-CH 2OH (D -mannitol, Sigma -Aldrich), 
as a hydroxyl radical scavenger.  
 
Instrumentation  
 
The pH measurements were done by means of a Wave pH -meter, provided with a digital 
presentation until the second decimal figure (± 0.01 pH) and a combination electrode, 
calibrated with the aid of commercial buffers of known pH (4.00 and 7.0 0, Sigma -Aldrich). 
The temperature was kept constant by means of a thermostatic bath provided with a digital 
reading (± 0.1 ºC). The kinetic runs were followed measuring periodically the absorbances at 
420 nm with a Shimadzu 160 A UV -Vis spectrophotometer (± 0.001 A), using glass cells of 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 6 cm optical path length. At that wavelength the electronic spectrum of one of the reaction 
products, [Fe(CN) 6]3-, shows a maximum absorption peak (   = 1015 M-1 cm-1) [43].  
 
Kinetic experiments  
 
The total volume of the r eaction mixtures was fixed at a constant value in all the experiments 
(25 mL). The last reactant to be added (1 mL of the desired concentration) to a thermostated 
aqueous solution containing all the other required chemicals (24 mL) was the reducing agent, 
Fe(II). In order to minimize the experimental errors associated with the kinetic data, the 
wavelength used to monitor the reaction (420 nm) was chosen as that leading to a higher 
increment of the solution absorbance between the initial and final points. Th e absorbances 
were periodically measured (time interval: 10 s) during at least 16 minutes. In total, 143 
kinetic runs were performed.  
 
Resolving the reproducibility problems  
 
The reaction between hexacyanoferrate(II) ion and hydrogen peroxide g ave unusual  problems 
of irreproducibility , situation that was clearly related to the hydrolysis of the initial complex  
[44], given that the initial rate depend ed on the time elapsed after preparation of its aqueous 
solution, as well as on the laboratory illumination conditions.  This difficulty was resolved by 
preparing the Fe(II) aqueous solution right before its use in each kinetic run, employing to 
that end already thermostated pure water as solvent , and no artificial light was used in the 
room during that procedure . Moreover, the time required for the preparation was reduced (and 
systematized from one experiment to another) as much as possible. In this way, a typical 
experiment repeated three times led to a standard deviation for the initial rate of ± 2.9 %.   
 
 
 
 
 
 7 Results  and discussion  
 
Initial rate method  
 
A striking observation was the unusual complexity of the absorbance -time plots for the 
hexacyanoferrate(II) ion -hydrogen peroxide reaction, where a dramatic slowing down was 
found right from the beginning of the proces s, more intense than would be expected for a 
pseudo -first order reac tion and even more  than for a pseudo -second order one , in spite of 
H2O2 being in larg e excess with respect to Fe(II) .   
Thus, the initial rate method was the preferred way for obtaining th e kinetic data. In our 
case, a fourth degree polynomial fitting the absorbance data corresponding to the first 240 s of 
each kinetic run yielded good enough results,  the magnitudes directly measured in the 
laboratory  (absorbance -time data couples)  being  fitted to a polynomial function of the type:

 8 Hydrolysis of hexacyanoferrate(II) ion  
 
The initial rate of the hexacyanoferrat e(II)-peroxide reaction showed a strong dependence on 
the time elapsed after the preparation of the K 4[Fe(CN) 6] stock solution, with a rapid increase 
at the beginning followed by a slow  decrease afterwards (Fig. 1 ).  
This finding is consistent with the inv olvement of two competitive reactions in the absence 
of H 2O2. One of them is the hydrolysis of hexacyanoferrate(II) ion, [Fe(CN) 6]4-, to yield 
pentacyanoaquaferrate(II) ion, [Fe(CN) 5(H2O)]3-. Provided that the latter is the actual active 
reducing agent for  H2O2, this would explain the increase in the initial rate. The other is the 
oxidation of [Fe(CN) 6]4- by dissolved O 2 to yield [Fe(CN) 6]3- (a potential inhibitor of the 
[Fe(CN) 6]4- + H 2O2 reaction), which  would explain the decrease in the initial rate aft er the 
maximum. Extrapolation of the initial rate at time zero, corresponding to the instant at which 
the stock Fe(II) aqueous solution was prepared, led to the value  vo / [Fe(CN) 64-]o[H2O2]o = (5.3 
± 1.7)  10-3 M-1 s-1 for the reaction of H 2O2 with fresh, non -hydrolyzed [Fe(CN) 6]4- at 25.0 
ºC (Fig. 1 , inset). At the maximum of the initial rate vs. time plot the value of that ratio had 
increased by a factor of 20, meaning that the hydrolyzed complex reacts with hydrogen 
peroxide much faster than the non -hydrolyzed one.  
The reversible hydrolysis of [Fe(CN) 6]4- follows the overall stoichiometry:

and its most probable mechanism consists of a three -step s equence of elementary r eactions:

This mechanism is coherent with the well -known property of hexacyanoferrates to release 
toxic hydrogen cyanide in strongly acidic media  [45]. The reason should be looked for in the 
property of neutral molecules (such as HCN or H 2O) to be released from the cationic metal 
center of a complex more easily than anionic ligands (such as CN  -) do. Further, this can also 
explain why the hydrolyzed complex , pentacyanoaquaferrate(II) ion, reacts with H 2O2 better 
than the non -hydrolyzed one, suggesting that the penta -coordinated ion formed in Eq. 7 has an 
important role as an intermediate, not only in the hydrolysis reaction, but also in the oxidation 
by hydr ogen peroxide. This behavior is analogous to that observed in the complexation of the 
anti-tumor drug cisplatin with biological thiols, where replacement of a chloride ligand by 
water dramatically increases the reaction rate  [46].  
The corresponding rate l aw may be obtained by application of the quasi -equilibrium 
approximation to Eq. 6 (considered as a very fast reversible step) and that of the steady state 
to pentacyanoferrate(II) ion (considered as a very reactive intermediate present in minute 
concentrat ion). This is equivalent to accept that the slow step is Eq. 7 in its forward direction, 
leading to the mathematical equation:

As an approximation, since the concentration of HCN  is indeed much smaller than that of 
water (997 g L-1/18.015 g mol-1 = 55.3 M), it can be assumed that
   3 4 2[HCN] << [H O]   t kk− , the

where 
oc  is the initial concentration of [Fe(CN) 6]4-, whereas  
tx  and 
ex  are the 
concentrations of [Fe(CN) 5(H2O)]3- (as well as of HCN) at time t and once the equilibrium is 
reached, respectively. Equation 1 2 was applied by assuming that the values of 
tx   and 
ex  
were directly proportional to the initial rates of  the [Fe(CN) 6]4- + H 2O2 reaction (after addition 
of hydrogen peroxide) at time t (vo,t) and at the maximum of the initial ra te vs. time plot given 
in Fig.  1 (vo,max), respectively, which is equivalent to accept that the [Fe(CN) 6]4- + H 2O2 redox 
reaction is  of first order in the intermediate [Fe(CN) 5(H2O)]3- formed in the hydrolysis 
reaction:

where C is the proportionality constant req uired to replace the x values by those of vo. From 
Eqs. 12 and 1 3 we infer:

Of the magnitudes appearing in the left -hand side of Eq. 14 the only one that is not directly 
available from the experimental data is  
ex. The value of this magnitude was optimized so that 
the linearity of the  ln {[

o o,max o,(  )t c v v − ]} vs. t plot was maximum.   
From the slope of the c orresponding linear plot (Fig. 2 ) and the value of 
ex  reached by 
optimization, the resulting rate constants for the  hydrolysis reaction were 
 1k  = (1.3 ± 0.2) 
 10-4 s-1 and 
1k− = 0.21 ± 0.04 M-1 s-1, yielding the equilibrium constant

1 1 1 3 =  / [H O ]K k k−
 = (6.2 ± 2.1)  103 (at 25.0 ºC) and a maximum value for the hydrolysis 
degree of 29.7 %. The values so obtained were subject to a certain experimental error caused 
by the side reaction of oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) with dissolved O 2. However, this error is 
probably of minor importance considering that the absol ute value of the slo pe of the plot 
shown in Fig. 1  after the maximum is much lower than the slope before that maximum, when 
calculated at instants symmetrical with respect to that maximum. This means that the O 2–
driven oxidation process happens at a rate m uch lower than the hydrolysis reaction.   
 
 
 
 
 
 12 The hydrolysis of hexacyanoferrate(II) ion is definitely a photochemical reaction  [48], as 
made evident by the finding that, when the K 4[Fe(CN) 6] stock solution was prepared and 
thermostated under ordinary laboratory -illumination conditions, its oxidation by H 2O2 was 
much faster than when it was prepared and thermostated under semi -darkness conditions (Fig.  
3). This feature is common with that presented by the photosensitive hydrolysis of 
hexacyanoferrate(III) ion  [49, 50]. 
 
Kinetic data of the redox reaction  
 
Five series of kinetic runs were performed at various initial concentrations of hydrogen 
peroxide, each of them consisting of five experiments differing in the initial concentration of 
hexacyanoferrate(II) ion, t he other conditions remaining unchanged. The corresponding plots 
showed a downward -concave curvature at low [H 2O2]o that slowly seemed to fade away as 
that concentration increased  (Fig. 4, top ). The same experiments allowed an analysis of the vo 
vs. [H 2O2]o dependence at different values of [Fe(II)] o, leading to downward -concave cu rves 
in all five cases (Fig, 4, bottom ).  
In the presence of hexacyanoferrate(III) ion, the vo vs. [Fe(II)] o plots showed first an 
upward -concave curvature followed by a do wnward -concave stretch (Fig. 5, top ). On the 
other hand, the vo vs. [Fe(III)] o plots showed a decreasing upward -concave pattern, indicating 
the existence of an autoinhibition effect caused by the oxidized complex forme d as reaction 
product (Fig. 5, bottom ). 
As th e concentration of KH 2PO 4 increased (the pH decreased) the initial rate first 
increased, passed through a maxim um and then decreased (Fig . 6). These results should be  
 
 
 
 
 
 13 interpreted in terms of a combination of both acid catalysis (predominant a high pH value s) 
and inhibition by phosphate ions (predominant a low pH values).  
The Fe(II) -H2O2 reaction was also inhibited by both the apparently inert electrolyte 
potassium chloride (Fig .7, top ) and the well -known hydroxyl radica l scavenger D -mannitol 
(Fig. 7, bottom ). The inhibition by KCl seemed to be too strong to be simply ascribed to an 
ionic strength effect.  
The experimental kinetic data were coherent wi th both the Arrhenius (Fig. 8 ) and Eyring 
equations, leading to the values of the activation parameters listed  in Table 1: the pre -
exponential factor ( A) and activation energy ( Ea) from the Arrhenius model, and the entropy 
(
oS ) and enthalpy (
oH ) of activation from the Eyring model.  
 
Experimental rate law  
 
The laborat ory results concerning the initial rate values obtained under different experimental 
conditions clearly pointed out to a rather complex kinetic equation. In order to get it, many 
trial mathematical functions were handled, and with each of them the percent error between 
the theoretical and measured values of the initial rate was obtained for 45 kinetic experiments, 
including different combinations of [Fe(II)] o, [H 2O2]o and [Fe(III)] o. As a general rule, the 
calculations indicated that the higher the number o f involved parameters ( N ), the lower the 
associated error, approaching asymptotically a minimum when N = 8 (Fig . 9). 
A flow chart summarizing some of the trial equations is shown in Scheme 1. For the sake 
of simplicity, the best option leading to the lowe st error has been chosen for each number of  
 
 
 
 
 
 14 parameters involved in the rate law. Finally, we arrived to what can be considered as the 
closest to reality kinetic equation, approaching as much as possible to the experimental data:

The coefficients involved in all the tentative rate laws were optimized by means of a 
computer program, starting with some trial values and changing them systematically until the 
minimum error between the theoretical and experimental values of th e initial rate was 
reached. For instance, in the case of the best 8 -parameter law ( Eq. 15) 1.21   108 different 
numerical combinations were required. The final values obtained for those coefficients, as 
well as their corresponding units, are compiled in Table 2.  
 
Reaction mechanism  
 
Given the complexity of the rate law obtained experimentally, it ca n be anticipated that a 
many -step mechanism will be required to explain it, probably involving the participation of 
free radicals as reaction intermediates. According to the available kinetic data, the best 
proposal we can offer is as follows:

The proposed mechanism starts with the hydrolyzed form of the reducing complex wh ose 
formation ha s been previously described in E qs. 6-8. The loss of the water ligand from that 
high stability hexa -coordinated complex leads to a low stability, very reactive penta -
coordinated complex (forward sense in Eq. 16), with a tendency to capture either a neutral 
molecule (such as H 2O, H 2O2 or dissolved O 2) or a cyanide ion (coming  from the complex 
hydrolysis, Eq.  7) as a sixth ligand  (backward sense in Eq.  16 and Eqs. 17-19).  
The capture of hydrogen peroxide as a ligand leads to the first redox s tep, where the 
transference of an electron from Fe(II) to the ligand results in the formation of Fe(III) and the 
lysis of the peroxide molecule into a hydroxide ion (that, because of its nature as a poor  
 
 
 
 
 
 16 leaving group  [51], will remain bonded to the centra l metal ion) and a hydroxyl radical. Given 
that the experimentally observed activation energy (28.9 ± 2.7 kJ mol-1, Table 1) was rather 
low for a reaction yielding hydroxyl radicals, we have opted for a concerted mechanism in 
which the electron transfer ta kes place simultaneously with the electrophilic addition of the 
emerging hydroxyl radical to a cyanide ligand to yield an organic free radical ( Eq. 20). In fact, 
the addition reaction between free cyanide ion and the hydroxyl radical has previously been 
reported  [52]. Moreover, an enhancement of the stability of the associated activated complex 
is expected by the electron -donating effect of the cyanide ligands. For instance, addition of L -
cysteine decreases dramatically the activation energy of the Fe2+/H2O2 Fenton reaction from 
95.9 to 47.9 kJ mol-1 [53]. The organic free radical so formed may react with a second 
hydrogen peroxide molecule to give a hydroperoxyl  radical (E q. 21), and by a posterior 
dissociation a superoxide radical ( Eq. 22). The correspondi ng acidity equilibrium constant is 
well known (p K11 = 4.69 at 25.0 ºC)  [54]. 
On the other hand, the complex resulting from the replacement of a water molecule ligand 
by dissolved oxygen is unstable enough to yield (via an internal redox process) more Fe(II I) 
and a superoxide ion radical  (Eq. 23).  
This intermediate may be found either in its protonated form (hydroperoxyl radical) or in 
its deprotonated one (superoxide ion) and, since the pH range of the present work was rather 
close to the p Ka of the former , both of them were present in similar concentrations. In 
addition, due to the differences in electron density, the electron -poor 
2HO.  behaves as an 
oxidant in a n Fe(II)   → Fe(III) process (Eq.  24) and the electron -rich 
 
2O.−  as a reductant in 
the opposite  Fe(III) → Fe(II) process (Eq. 25 ), the latter thus explaining the autoinhibition 
provoked by the hexacyanoferrate(III) ion formed as reaction product.   
 
 
 
 
 
 17 Hydroperoxyl radical, as well as its deprotonated form (sup eroxide ion), may react with 
hydrogen peroxide t o give a hydroxyl radical (Eq. 26 ). Although the existence of these 
reactions has often been put into question  [55, 56], small but appreciable values (0.50 ± 0.09 
M-1 s-1 for hydroperoxyl radical and 0.13 ± 0 .07 M-1 s-1 for superoxide ion at 23.5 ºC) have 
been reported for their rate constants  [57, 58]. The hydroxyl radical so formed is expected to 
react mainly with Fe(II) to yield more Fe(III) (Eq. 27 ).  
Finally, it has been proposed that some of the hydroper oxyl/superoxide radicals may arrive 
at the reactor walls to disproportionate into O 2 and H 2O2 on their surface (Eq. 28 ). Actually, 
an inhibiting surface effect has been reported for the Cu(II)/H 2O2 reaction and explained in 
the same way  [30]. 
 
Theoretical rate law  
 
In order to compare the microscopic information contained in the mechanism with the 
macroscopic one gathered in the laboratory, it is necessary to deduce the theoretical rate law. 
For this purpose, the application of two different approximations,  steady state and quasi -
equilibrium  [59, 60], was required. The first approximation can be applied only to short -lived, 
very reactive intermediates and was used to obtain the concentrations of the penta -coordinated 
complex ( formed in Eq. 16 ), the Fe(II) -H2O2 complex ( formed in Eq. 18 ), the Fe(II) -O2 
complex (formed in Eq. 19 ), the organic free radical (formed in Eq. 20 ), the hydroperoxyl 
radical (formed in Eq. 21 ), the superoxide ion radical (formed in Eqs. 22 and 23 ) and the 
hydroxyl radical (formed in Eq. 26). The second approximation can be applied only to very 
fast, reversible reactions, and this requirement was indeed fulfilled in the case of Eq. 22 .  
 
 
 
 
 
 18 The theoretical rate law so deduced is consistent with the experimental one ( Eq. 15 ), the 
macroscopic -microscopic relationships being those given in Table 3. Moreover, it can explain 
the observation of acid catalysis (increasing stretch in Fig. 6 ), since protonation of the 
superoxide ion radical favors the reaction (FeII → FeIII, Eq. 24 ) whereas deprotonation of the 
hydroperoxyl radical has the opposite effect (FeIII → FeII, Eq. 25 ). Notwithstanding, there is 
also an additional cause for the observed acid catalysis, given that a decrease of the pH results 
in a higher degr ee of hydrolysis of the initial Fe(II) complex ( Eq. 5 ). 
On the other hand, the inhibition by phosphate ions (decreasing stretch in Fig. 6 ), as well 
as that by chloride ion ( Fig. 7, top ), can be explained by a competition between either H 2PO 4- 
or Cl - and H 2O2 to fill the vacant position in the penta -coordinated Fe(II) complex formed in 
Eq. 16 , although minor contributions due to ionic strength effects and reactions of those ions 
with the hydroxyl radical formed in Eq. 26  cannot be discarded (the reactions o f both 
phosphate  [61] and chloride  [62] ions with that radical are well documented).  
The initial rate decreased in the presence of the polyalcohol D -mannitol (Fig . 7, bottom ). 
Since this natural sweetener of vegetable origin is a well -known specific hydro xyl radical 
scavenger  [63, 64], its inhibitory effect may be taken as an experimental proof of the 
participation of that strongly oxidizing radical as a reaction intermediate.  
 
Numerical simulations  
 
The proposed mechanism has been obtained from laborator y measurements extrapolated to t 
= 0. In order to check its validity at other instants during the course of the reaction, the 
experimental rate law ( Eq. 15) was integrated by an approximate numerical procedure known  
 
 
 
 
 
 19 as the fourth -order  Runge -Kutta method [ 65], using to that end the coefficients appearing in 
Table 2.  
The resulting absorbance -time plots corresponding to a couple of kinetic runs performed 
one in the initial absence of the autoinhibitor Fe(III) (Fig.  10, top) and the other in its presence 
(Fig. 10, bottom ), all the other experimental conditions being the same, are shown. As can be 
observed, the simulations indicated that a reasonably good agreement between theory and 
experiment was reached also at t > 0.  
Thus, it can be concluded that the experi mental rate law obtained by application of the 
initial rate method, as well as the mechanism proposed to explain it, are both close 
approximations to the reality of this indeed complex free radical reaction.
