In aquatic/terrestrial systems, Hg can be converted by anaerobic microorganisms to mono-methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxin accumulated in the food web [1]. In iron-rich sediments where Hg is methylated, vivianite, a ferrous phosphate mineral, commonly occurs in immediate vicinity of organic remains. However, FeII-bearing minerals are recognized as HgII reducers such as magnetite [2] or green rusts [3]. The reduction of HgII to Hg0 by vivianite (FeII3(PO4)2.8H2O) was investigated by fluctuating Hg/Fe ratios (0.1, 1, 100) at circumneutral pH under anoxic conditions to illuminate kinetic parameters and the nature FeIII-bearing minerals formed. The ability of vivianite to reduce inorganic divalent Hg is of high importance to (i) unravel the interplay of Hg and Fe biogeochemical cycles, and to (ii) limit the production of MeHg in anoxic sediments by the formation of elemental Hg.
