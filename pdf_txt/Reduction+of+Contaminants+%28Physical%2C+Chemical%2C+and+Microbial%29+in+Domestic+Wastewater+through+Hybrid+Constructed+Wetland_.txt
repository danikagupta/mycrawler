Abstract 
Pollutant removal by the mechanism of constructed wetland has led to low cost, highly 
efficient wastewater treatment technology. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are artificial 
engineered systems that mimic like natural wetlands. CW’s have been used in previous 
research to treat a broad range of waste streams at large-scale for low-cost application in 
wastewater management. Generally, the most literature has targeted a particular class of 
mechanism or the other due to lack of generalized techniques for wastewater management 
using CWs.  This work focuses on to introductory information and review on concept of 
CWs based on the latest mechanisms for the wastewater treatment to inspire economical 
and sustainable solutions to water based environmental problems. This research emphasis 
CW mechanism, construction, design, and applications of CWs as well as optimization of 
CWs for the treatment of wastewater. This review also highlights the study with different 
treatment stages of CWs for removing pollutants from different types of wastewaters .

1. INTRODUCTION  
Currently, India is facing water scarcity problem (Rijsberman et al. 2006, Mishra, 
V et al. 2021). It takes over millions of lives every year affected by water scarcity 
(Mekonnen, M. M. et al.2016, Dolan, F. et al. 2021). Hence the immediate need 
arises to save the water resources and find ways for reclamation or reuse of water. 
Due to untreated waste disposal into natural water resources results in rapid 
increase of pollution in water resources and which has been doubled in the recent 
years (Chakraborti t al. 2019, Shannon et al. 2008, Bhardwaj RM. 2005). Industrial 
development has also gained a rapid growth due to its increased demand and due 
to urbanization but because of water contamination and degradation of natural 
water resources. The treatment of wastewater ought to be the top priority for the 
country to put a stop to the proliferation of water environment problems (Kalbar, 
P. P et al. 2012, Asano, T. et al. 1996, Boller, M. 1997). Reclamation of 
wastewater is the priority for the ecologists after looking at the current scenario. 
Aquatic systems are contaminated with heavy metals have high density (≥ 5 g/ 
cm3), due to agricultural seepage or runoff and industrial discharge. Increased 
level of contamination of heavy metals in water has negative impact on ecological 
function of water (Bashir, I. et al. 2020). Typically, the wastewater contains 
pathogens, total solids, nutrients, other organic elements and few traces of heavy 
metals. It is reported that the rivers are polluted due to the industrial waste disposal 
because of the presence of high BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) and 
ammoniac nitrogen (NH 3- N). These pollutants are out of their permissible limit 
which makes the wastewater contaminated (Chinnusamy, C. 2019, Abowei et al. 
2005). They can be brought under their permissible limit before their disposal to 
prevent the contamination. To comply with maximum permissible discharge 
limits for different pollutants a proper treatment of wastewater is mandatory 
before discharging into the surface waters. However, in majority of the developing 
countries like India, Pakistan etc. it has not yet been accomplished, partly due to 
power outages or poor maintenance (Rai et al., 2015; Carty et al., 2008). 
Regarding this water it requires suitable water standards. Now looking at the 
situation the question arises whether to find technologies that is economical to 
treat the contaminated water for irrigation and cultivation purposes. We must find 
efficient ways to safeguard our water resources. Waste-water treatment plays a 
predominant role to reduce the level of contamination into the water sources. 
Elimination of the harmful pollutant form contaminated water and reuse for 
various purpose is a possible key to the water based environmental problems. Now 
surface quality is degrading days due to negative impact. Pollutants originating 
from wastewater are characterized differently which affects the ecosystem. It 
results in the alterations of flora and fauna of the community (Donde, O.O. 2017).  
The Economical and Sustainable Solutions  to water based environmental 
problems is wastewater treatment. Various treatments methods are found and are 262 Smily VISHWAKRMA, Dr. DHARMENDRA 
  
still in progress to find a best, is Constructed Wetlands (CW) (Thorslund, J et al. 
2017). In the few decades, artificial engineered wetlands known as CWs, has 
established a strong ground for treatment of wastewater in comparison 
conventional treatment systems.  CWs is the cheaper alternative for treatment of 
different kind of wastewater such as domestic, agricultural, industrial etc . 
(Vymazal, J. 2011; Omondi, D.O et al. 2020, Yalcuk and Ugurlu, 2009; Vymazal, 
J et al. 2021; Almuktar et al. 2018). Currently, focus of researchers have been 
shifted towards understanding of better design, evolution, and performance of 
CWs, and numerous studies focuses on efficient use of CWs for removing 
pollutants such as organic matter, nutrients, heavy metals, trace elements, 
pharmaceutical contaminants, pathogens, etc. from wastewater (Langergraber, G., 
& Dotro, G. (2019); Ji, Z et al. 2021; Christofilopoulos, S et al. 2019; Nivala, J 
2013). CWs are a sustainable and more environment friendly approach for 
reducing environmental pollution and use of local resources. CWs can be adopted 
in small towns and villages as being simple in installation and operation. Due to 
the high level of the removal efficiency of dyes, heavy metal, micropollutants, 
bacteria, nutrients and organic pollutants constructed wetlands (CW) has invited 
interests of many researchers in the field of wastewater treatment. Constructed 
wetlands act like an estuary and serve as biofilters to eliminate pollutants from 
wastewater (Pawęska, K et al. 2011). In the work presented in (Bruch, I et al. 2011; 
Perdana, M.C et al. 2018; Zhao, Y.J. et al. 2011; Ávila, C. 2014; Khalifa, M. E. 
2020), authors have examined the efficiency of CWs based on the various 
treatment stages and use of different media type. Subsequently, research 
contribution published on pollutant removal efficiency and overall performance 
of CWs based on several factors such as substrate, vegetation, pH, temperature, 
substrate, vegetation, hydraulic loading rates (HLR), hydraulic retention time 
(HRT), dissolved oxygen (DO), and mode of feeding etc. (Jain, M. et al. 2020; 
Wu, H et al. 2015; Lim, P.E et al. 2003). CWs have many leads over the traditional 
sewage treatment method due to low cost, easy to maintain, and eco-friendly. 
Many mechanisms and generalized techniques for wastewater treatment based on 
CWs have been studied in the past few years, the detail of which can be found in 
(Gunes, K. et al. 2011; Kumar, S and Dutta, V 2019; Qasaimeh, A. et al. 2015; 
Verlicchi, P. 2014). The constructed wetland appeared to be a more cost-effective 
alternative to conventional treatment modalities which involve huge energy and 
cost. However, major key issues such as long-term effective treatment process, 
sustainable operation are still remained open. Over the years, process of CWs has 
made great advancement, but still a gap in better understanding of cost and 
optimization of CWs. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a study to inspire 
economical and sustainable solutions for the enhancement of Constructed Wetland 
with the help of in-depth review of previous studies while acknowledge the 
detected gaps. Generally, the most literature is targeting a particular class of 
mechanism or the other due to lack of generalized techniques for wastewater A CRITICAL REVIEW ON ECONOMICAL AND SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS

management using CWs. Hence this paper focuses on providing and inspiring 
economical and sustainable solutions for the enhancement of constructed wetland 
based on the latest mechanisms for the wastewater treatment. 
2. CONCEPT OF CONSTRUCTED WETLAND  
A wetland is a transitional land that are adapted to soaked with water, either 
permanently or seasonally. The definition of wetland can be reformulated based 
on the different purpose and can be characterised into many forms. The primary 
characteristics such as vegetation of aquatic plants distinguish wetlands from other 
landforms or water bodies. Generally, wetland is of two types (i) Natural and (ii) 
Constructed as shown in figure 1. 
 
Fig. 1. Wetland classification 
Natural wetland systems are natural purifiers of wastewater treatment which 
contribute to water absolution, water regulation and recreation. 
Constructed wetlands are artificial engineered systems that are used to 
remove contaminants from wastewater. They consist of wetlands, soil or channels 
that have aquatic plants planted in them, and utilizing natural process such as 
microbial, biological, physical, and chemical processes to treat the wastewater. 
These systems, which are primarily made up of vegetation, substrates, soil, gravel, 
microorganisms, and water, employ complex processes that involve physical, 
chemical, and biological mechanisms to get rid of various contaminants or 
improve the quality of the water. Constructed wetlands are most economical as 
compared to conventional treatment units as they need more energy for its process 
and the following methods require cheaper available materials. 
The following five major components for a Constructed Wetland 
       • Basin 
       • Substrate 
       • Vegetation 
       • Liner 
       • Inlet/Outlet arrangement system. 
Constructed Wetlands are efficient wetlands that are acknowledged as effective 
wastewater treatment method. They can be used to treat different wastes 
generating from sewage, paper mill industry, pulp, glass, petrochemical, 
greywater, effluent from dairy, brewery and many more industries. These are eco-
friendly and are economically sustainable. It had multiple advantages like raising 
the importance of wastewater, habitat enrichment, use in various fields etc. These 
264 Smily VISHWAKRMA, Dr. DHARMENDRA 
  
are economically cheap as they are easy to operate, they require less labor, cheaper 
instrument requirements. Plants are used in the wetlands which are selected 
according to the prevailing environmental conditions and availability. HRT and 
HLR is an important and practical criterion for optimizing the performance of a 
wetland system (Kataki, S. et al. 2021, Zhao, Y. et al. 2020; Reed, S. C. 1992). 
3. EVOLUTION OF CONSTRUCTED WETLAND 
Historically, Käthe Seidel from Germany conducted the first experiment of 
wastewater treatment using macrophytes and in the 1960s he invented the concept 
of vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland which was previously called as 
the "root zone" method. Since then, the constructed wetland (CW) concept 
becomes efficient and environment friendly technology for the treatment of 
wastewater. Typical reasons for using constructed wetlands are water and 
wastewater quality improvement, flood control prepares water for reuse and 
creation of habitat to compensate for natural wetland converted for agricultural or 
urban development (Sim et al. 2013). CWs have also emerged as a promising 
technique to remove nutrients and pollutants from various wastewaters (Cui, L.F. 
2012). These systems have a simple construction, large buffering capacity, little 
extra sludge production, self-adaptive treatment process, as well as low operation 
and maintenance cost (Ye and Li, 2009).  
4. TYPES OF CONSTRUCTED WETLAND  
Figure 1 illustrates a several various type of CWs that exist. The primary 
distinctions between the three categories of constructed wetlands for the treatment 
of wastewater are as follows: There are Traditional CWs, Enhanced CWs, and 
Integrated CWs. Further subdivided into free water surface (FWS) CWs and 
subsurface flow (SSF) CWs in accordance with the hydrology of the wetland. 
(Saeed and Sun, 2012). Free water surface is like natural wetlands and the 
subsurface constructed wetland can be classified as: vertical (VSSF) and 
horizontal sub-surface flow (HSSF) which encounter the process based on the 
flow of horizontally or vertically (Sylla, A. 2020; Shukla, R. et al. 2021; Galve, J. 
C. A. et al. 2021; Khan, N. A. et al. 2020). Integrated CWs are well known with 
the combination of various wetland systems, such as (VF–HF CWs, HF–VF CWs, 
HF-FWS CWs and FWS-HF CWs) (Vymazal, 2013; Rani, N. et al. 2021; Kiflay, 
E 2021).

Generally, the design combination consisted of two stages in parallel and series. 
In addition to that, the multi-stage CWs utilizes more no. stages of CWs (Kadlec 
and Wallace, 2009). In Recent years no. of research carried out based on 
artificially aerated CWs, hybrid towery CWs, and other forms of enhanced CWs 
to boost the efficacy of wastewater treatment systems (Wu et al., 2014). 
5. MECHANISM IN CONSTRUCTED WETLAND 
A constructed wetland is a wastewater treatment system which improves the 
efficiency of the processes that help to treat the water similar to naturally occurring 
wetlands. The system includes plants, weeds, substrates, micro-organisms, water, 
different filters (sand, gravel, soil etc.) It has a lot of extensive options in design. 
The microbiological activity is the key parameter for their performance. In 
general, the mechanism which takes place in the constructed wetland system is

that there is a combination of filter and purification system in which the plants, 
microorganisms and substrates play a vital role. plants in constructed wetland, 
contribute to nutrient transformation, provides mechanical resistance to flow, 
increase the retention time, facilitate settling of suspended particulates, and 
improve conductance of water through the media as the roots grow. A typical CW 
consists of a pond with substrate, media, and vegetation. Influent flows in the CW 
and gets treated by physical, chemical, and biological means aerobic respiration, 
denitrification, sulphate reduction, acid fermentation, and methanogenesis. CWs 
improve wastewater quality through various processes such as physical, chemical, 
and biological (Kadlec et al. 2009, Garcia et al. 2010). The mechanism involved 
in the EC process generally consists of various stages mainly listed as below: 
1. At First, water is allowed to enter the wetland, sedimentation of solid takes 
place. As the water flows through the constructed wetland, the rhizomes of 
the plant roots and the substrate remove the larger particles present in the 
wastewater.  
2. Pollutants and nutrients present in the wastewater naturally break down and 
get consumed up by the bacteria and plant, hence remove them from the water. 
3. The Hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the wetland is an important factor to 
consider, which varies according to the design and desired quality level of the 
treatment system.  
4. After the treatment using constructed wetland, water can be safely released 
into surface waters or used for different purposes according to the safety 
standards.

        In this paper, the main mechanisms that takes place in CWs are (i) the 
transformations i.e. Chemical reactions which includes precipitation, flocculation, 
oxidation/reduction reactions, acid/ base reactions, and biochemical reactions 
occurring both under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and (ii) the solid liquid 
separations which includes gravity separation, ion exchange, filtration, absorption, 
Uptake by the helophytes and microorganisms and adsorption. These both the 
processes together lead to the pollutant and contaminant removal in Constructed 
Wetlands. (EPA 2000). The processes that take place in the removal of pollutants 
are physical, chemical, and biological (Choudhary et al. 2011). 
6. APPLICATION OF CWs FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT  
At the early stage, the application of CWs was mainly focused on treating of 
traditional domestic and municipal wastewater. Due to the consequence of water 
pollution caused by industries, agriculture fields, mines, river, lakes and runoff 
and degradation of natural water resources the application of CWs has been 
crucially expanded to decontaminate agricultural effluents, industrial effluents, 
and so on (Wang, M. et al. 2018; Cronk, J.K. 1996; Ignatowicz, K 2020). (Kadlec 
and Wallace, 2009) investigated that the free water surface CWs are the most 
efficient type in removal of suspended solids and organics as compared to surface 
flow CWs. But SSFs CWs are the most effective in removal to microbial pollution 
and heavy metals. This types of CWs depends on the treatment stages, variation 
of grading material and media can be used in different wastewater treatment 
applications. Table 2 provides a summary of the studies that were carried out on 
the various stages of treatment of CWs in order to treat different types of 
wastewaters, such as domestic sewage, agricultural wastewater, and industrial 
effluent, amongst others.

7. BENEFITS AND LIMITATION OF CONSTRUCTED 
WETLAND PROCESS  
Constructed wetlands are of the advantage that they are easily operated, low cost 
and maintenance compared to the conventional systems. CWs coupled/ integrated 
with other treatment technologies have been investigated to make the system more 
efficient and to overcome the shortages of individual CWs systems. The combined 
system maximizes the advantages and constructs a combined win-win system. 
Additional pros and cons of Constructed wetland process are given in the Table 3.

8. RECENT TRENDS OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT USING 
CONSTRUCTED WETLAND  
Our main objective is to discuss the knowledge on the sustainability of CWs and 
to discuss the recent development of CWs in the wastewater treatment. Treatment 
of wastewater to be adopted should be ecofriendly where special equipment and 
electricity is not required. There are systems for the treatment that constitutes an 
interface between terrestrial system and the aquifer systems. Today the wastewater 
requires high level of treatment so as to get rid of the contaminants and to be safe 
for further use. Wastewater can be reclaimed and reused at home easily like using 
the bathing water for flowering and planting purpose, any liquid which will be 
discarded after boiling like boiling pasta or noodles, water used for washing 
clothes may be recycled as water for plants rather than wasting it. There are many 
other wastewater treatment techniques, including filters and chemical treatments, 
activated sludge and oxidation ponds but the setup is costly and is difficult to 
operate.  There are innumerable processes for the treatment of wastewater such as 
activated sludge process (ASP), membrane bioreactor (MBR), moving bed bio 
reactor (MBBR), membrane sequencing batch reactor (MSBR), photo catalysis, 
electro- Fenton (EF), membrane filtration, hybrid anaerobic reactor, micro aerobic 
hydrolysis acidification (MHA), up- flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), etc. 
which might reduce the practicability and economic feasibility of the treatment 
processes. CWs are known to be a reliable wastewater treatment technology which 
has its own benefits good purification effect, low construction and operation cost, 
energy consumption, maintenance and, as well as astounding ecological benefit. 
They are used as a suitable solution for the treatment of various types of 
wastewaters around the world, such as, municipal sewage, domestic sewage, 
industrial wastewater, non-point source agricultural pollution and polluted surface 
water. 
There are different treatment stages like primary, secondary and tertiary. 
These are carried out according to the characteristics of wastewater. The primary 
system occurs in which its function is to reduce Oil & Gas, suspended solids and 
turbidity. After which further biological treatments takes place. Amongst all 
Activated Sludge Process (ASP) is found the most effective mainly in the removal 
of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from 70-80%. The pollutants removal 
efficiency depends on the composition of wastewater. The amalgamation of two 
or more biological processes can be more effective in treating wastewater. Hence 
the integration of various processes mechanical, physical, chemical and biological 
treatments has been found effective in achieving higher removal efficiency. 
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) may be considered as a better alternative 
than adsorption. They have a tendency to break the parent compound into their 
non-harmful or non-toxic forms and the organics use adsorption to turn over from 
one medium to other i.e., from aqueous to a solid medium (Doherty, L. et al. 2015).  A CRITICAL REVIEW ON ECONOMICAL AND SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS

8.1. Anaerobic Treatment Followed by Constructed Wetland 
Systems combining constructed wetlands with anaerobic bioreactors have proved 
to be efficient and adequate for wastewater treatment. Anaerobic treatment 
consists of Up-flow Aerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB), continuously stirred tank 
reactor/digester/Up-flow Anaerobic Filters, ultrahigh rate fluidized bed reactors, 
two-stage UASB reactor along with constructed wetlands. Wastewater consists of 
Parameters such as Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD 5), chemical oxygen 
Demand (COD), pH, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), organic matter, NH 3, NO2-, 
NO3- and Total suspended solids (TSS) which are measured by laboratory methods 
(Alberto Fernández del Castillo et al.) Anaerobic Reactors and CW complements 
each other with simple design, operation, reduced cost and low energy input 
(Alvarez, J.A et al).Treatment of wastewater using Anaerobic filters are more 
preferable than conventional treatment methods it consumes less time and has the 
potential to treat wastewater containing high COD loads (M. K. Daud et al.). In 
the study an integrated system is made which consists of horizontal subsurface 
flow constructed wetland (HSSFCW), anaerobic baffled filter (ABR) and floating 
constructed wetland (FCW). In this Anaerobic conversion of organic nitrogen to 
ammonium takes place and nitrate reduces to ammonium, the amount of 
ammonium in ABR gets increased and it gets decreased in HSSFCW and FCW 
stages. Due to the good removal efficiency of the parameters TSS, COD, BOD 5, 
and phosphate, the integrated system consisting of horizontal subsurface flow 
constructed wetland (HSSFCW), anaerobic baffled filter (ABR) and floating 
constructed wetland (FCW) is considered efficient (Kifaly, E. 2021).

8.2. Microbial Fuel Cell Incorporated with Hybrid Constructed 
Wetland (HCW-MFC) 
Constructed wetland (CW) and microbial fuel cell (MFC) have an inherent 
characteristic that is they both depend on microbial conversion of organic and 
272 Smily VISHWAKRMA, Dr. DHARMENDRA 
  
inorganic wastes. Because of which anode can be incorporated in the anaerobic 
section and cathode in the aerobic section of Constructed wetland system and 
hence Constructed wetland- microbial fuel cells (CW-MFCs) be created. This 
technology can generate bio-energy and can enhance treatment efficiency at the 
same time and can be proved efficient. Hybrid constructed wetland-microbial fuel 
cells (HCW-MFCs) should be paid more attention and should be expanded for 
large and practical purpose. For this, inlet strategies and flow regimes should be 
looked into to improve the efficiency of the treatment system (Ren, B. et al. 2020). 
CW-MFC system simultaneously along with the production of bioelectricity and 
it treats organic compounds, phosphorus and nitrogen depends. 
The design of MFC-CW system shown in figure 4 (Yaqian Zhao et al. 2013) 
depends on substrate material, electrode material, wetland plant, hydraulic 
retention time, flow regime, and microbial activities. For the enhancement of CW-
MFC, different packing layers of CW and electrode material of different kind 
could be used so that there could be diversity, richness and different microbial 
composition. Role of Plants is to promote richness of the electrode surface and 
electrode surface affects the microbial community. Environment condition is also 
a key factor in microbial decomposition (Xiao Huang et al.) (2021). 
For high strength wastewater, novel stacked system could be developed in 
which stacks are vertically arranged which helped in enhancement of wastewater 
technique and electricity generation. It takes less space and is economical. For the 
removal of organics and nitrogen from wastewater Microbial fuel cell integrated 
with an HF-VUF-CW (horizontal flow- vertical up flow constructed wetland) has 
been proven to be an efficient technology. MFC-CW can improve efficiency in a 
better way than the other conventional constructed wetland systems. For example, 
Lei xu et al. made a multiple-cathode MFC-CW and found removal efficiency of 
NH4–N which increased from 44.63 to 81.10. He compared the integrated system 
to conventional CW and showed removal percentage. It had 5% higher COD and 
22% NH 4–N, respectively. More importantly, MFC-CW (microbial fuel cell- 
constructed wetland) provides electrochemically active bacteria (EAB) for good 
and healthy environment (Sun, G et al. 2005; Pratiksha Srivastava et al. 2020).

8.3. Alum Sludge –CW 
 
Alum sludge-based CW is considered as a recent trend in today’s development. 
“Alum sludge” means “aluminium-based residual” obtained from wastewater 
treatment. It is an unavoidable waste material in the treatment process. 
Aluminium-salt is used as coagulant. Alum sludge is used as a substrate in the 
working of Constructed Wetland in which aluminium salts are used as coagulant. 
Alum sludge is a low-cost substrate material and has great working features due 
to which is proposed (1) high content of Aluminium ion for Phosphorus 
immobilization, which makes sludge a reliable, cost-effective and environment 
friendly adsorbent for P removal; (2) is easily available (Ren, B. et al. 2020). The 
study has demonstrated that the system is a cheap wastewater treatment system in 
achieving the efficiencies in removing pollutants, especially Phosphorus. It 
obtained 57–83%- BOD 5, 36–83% - COD, 11–77 % TN, 49–93% NH 4-N, 75–
94% TP, 73–97% P (inorganic phosphorus) and 46–83% for SS, respectively. A 
Conceptual illustration of beneficial integration of alum sludge into a wastewater 
treatment shown in figure 5 (Hu, Y et al.2012). A multi-stage constructed wetland 
system can be made in which alum sludge is used as substrate which enhances the 
efficiency and removal of phosphorus and organic matter from the wastewater 
(Babatunde, A. O. et al. 2010) For treating low concentration wastewater, a 
dewatered alum sludge-based constructed wetland system was designed which 
was planted with Phragmites Australis and was efficient in the TN and phosphate 
removal regardless of the value of HRT (Kang, W. et al. 2022)

treatment (Zhao, Y 2011)

8.4. CW with Activated Sludge Process (ASP)  
CW technology is a sustainable and efficient wastewater treatment in today’s 
world. Integration of constructed wetland with activated sludge process could be 
advantageous as they both have its own benefits. An emerging recent trend in this 
field consists of technique integrating CW into the main wastewater treatment 
process (activated sludge process) to setup a “Green-Bio-sorption Reactor” (GBR) 
in which “green” stands for plant or wetland and “sorption” represents the wetland 
substrate (Liu, R. et al. 2017). The Constructed wetland system is a wastewater 
treatment technology which is biofilm-based, i.e., biofilm and microorganism 
activities are the main framers for wastewater treatment and its purification. 
Ranbin Liu et al. studied that the integration of CW and sequencing batch reactor 
proved to be more advantageous than they work individually. A figure 6 from 
(Liu, R. et al. 2017) illustrate the conceptual application of CWs integrated with 
conventional activated sludge. 
 
 
Fig.6. Conceptual application of CWs integrated with conventional activated sludge 
8.5. Standard CW 
Standard CW is also known as Modular CW. Construction of CW is very time 
consuming and also requires a lot of space. But CWs are being designed basis of 
rule-of-thumb. Therefore, it is highly desired that a real modular CW system 
should be designed in such a way that it allows rapid construction/assembling and 
increase in the flow. As such, in 2016 China developed a conceptual design of a 
real modular horizontal subsurface flow Constructed Wetland system (MHSSF-
CW). It was in-situ and was constructed in a way that it can be assembled easily 
and quickly to form a good and efficient modular CW. The modular constructed 
wetland can be used for the treatment of domestic sewage. The sewage flow would 
be a factor in the construction and design of modular CW. The scale of the wetland 
would depend on the actual sewage flow. It has high applicability and feasibility. 
In addition, the efficiency of modular constructed wetland can be enhanced by 
A CRITICAL REVIEW ON ECONOMICAL AND SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS  
FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT USING CONSTRUCTED WETLAND  275 
  
integrating it with different treatment systems, such as advanced oxygen, 
Membrane Bio Reactor (MBR) and other treatment systems for a good and 
efficient wastewater treatment system. (Changsong, C. et al. 2021). The study 
made four types of CW which obtained good efficiency and pollutant removal 
which were (1) planted system with media layer of vertical woodchip (WP), (2) 
unplanted system along with vertical woodchip media layer (W), (3) unplanted 
with media layer of vertical bottom ash (B), and (4) planted with vertical bottom 
ash media layer (BP). They ranked as: BP > B > WP > W Constructed Wetland. 
The nutrient removal rate for reed and cattail growth was correlated. The study 
recommended a surface area of 0.26 to 0.9% for unplanted CW and 0.25 to 0.8% 
of catchment area for planted CW using the 7.5 to 10 mm design rainfall. (J. Y. 
Choi et al.). 
 
Fig.7. Commercial wastewater constructed wetland wastewater treatment system 
Perspectives of CW in India–India is one of the world’s countries which suffer 
water-scarcity as a major problem. In 2019 India’s wastewater treatment plants 
were USD 2.4 billion. By 2025, it is expected that water demand may reach USD 
4.3 billion due to its increasing demand. Municipal water as well as sewage water 
treatment plant is setup across the country, according to Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI 
Aayog. Central urban schemes such as Swachh Bharat Mission, Jal Shakti 
Abhiyan, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), 
Smart Cities Mission and Namami gange are the schemes which are started 
especially for the conservation of water by treatment of wastewater. They also lay 
stress on the reuse and recycle of wastewater (including blackwater and 
greywater) for its use in various sectors. An example of the commercial waste 
water constructed wetland wastewater treatment system is shown in Figure 7.  
(https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/constructed-wetland-wastewater-
treatment system-18009387855.html).

9. CONCLUSIONS 
Substantial attempts have been made to expand the Constructed Wetlands 
technology as a green technology for treatment of wastewater. Use of this 
technology holds the aim for water protection and conservation for the habitat. 
The scope of the Constructed Wetland has been intensified and Constructed 
wetland systems have been integrated to give a more efficient system. In coming 
years, the constructed wetland system should be incorporated with the 
conventional CW and will be expanding more. These include Anaerobic 
Treatment followed by constructed wetland, aerated- CW, alum sludge- CW, 
activated sludge with CW, Microbial Fuel Cell-Constructed Wetland (MFC-CW) 
and the modular CW. Development of Constructed Wetland relies on the nature 
of its substrate and on many other factors. Further developments of the 
Constructed Wetlands should focus on it’s the water recycling and reuse to 
maximum its purpose being an important part of green environment.
