SYNOPSIS
 
Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial (ESETT)
 
A multicenter, randomized, blinded, comparative effectiveness study of fosphenytoin, valproic
 
acid, or levetiracetam in the emergency department treatment of patients with
 
benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus.
 
Objectives:  
​
The 
​
primary 
​
objective is to determine the most effective and/or the least effective
 
treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus (SE) among patients older than 2
 
years.  There are three active treatment arms being compared:  fosphenytoin (FOS),
 
levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA).  The 
​
second 
​
objective is comparison of three drugs
 
with respect to secondary outcomes.  The final objective is to ensure that the trial is
 
informative for treatment of established SE in children by describing the effectiveness, safety,
 
and rate of adverse reactions of these drugs in children.
 
Primary outcome:  
​
The  primary outcome is clinical cessation of status epilepticus, determined
 
by the absence of clinically apparent seizures and improving responsiveness, at 60 minutes
 
after the start of study drug infusion, without the use of additional anti-seizure medication. The
 
following
​
 
​
are 
​
secondary outcomes
​
: occurrence of life threatening hypotension or cardiac
 
arrhythmia, time to termination of seizures, intubation, admission to ICU, seizure recurrence,
 
length of stay in the ICU and hospital, mortality, and Richmond agitation and sedation score at
 
60 minutes, will be compared between treatment groups.
 
 
Methods:
​
 This is a randomized, multicenter,  Bayesian response adaptive comparative
 
effectiveness trial of three active treatments in patients with status epilepticus who have failed
 
treatment with benzodiazepines.  Each subject will be followed until discharge or 30 days from
 
enrollment, whichever comes first. This trial will be monitored for early success and futility.
 
 
Inclusion:
​
 Patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age, witnessed to have a clinically
 
apparent seizure in the ED, 5-30 minutes after already having received at least an adequate
 
dose of benzodiazepines for generalized, tonic-clonic convulsion(s).  Adequate doses of
 
benzodiazepines for this study are defined as:  diazepam 10 mg IV, lorazepam 4 mg IV, or
 
midazolam 10 mg IV or IM for subjects greater than or equal to 40 kg, and diazepam 0.3mg/kg
 
IV, lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV or midazolam 0.3mg/kg IM or 0.2 mg/kg IV for subjects less than 40
 
kg.  These drugs may have been administered in two or more divided doses, including in the
 
out-of-hospital setting.
 
Interventions and Duration:
​
 The required concentrations of the study drugs (FOS 16.66 mg/ml,
 
VPA 33.33 mg/ml and LEV 50 mg/ml) will be produced, packaged and labeled by the  University
 
of California at Davis Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility and shipped to the study sites.
 
The study drugs are identical in appearance, formulation, packaging, and administration
 
 
 
11
  
(including volume and rate of infusion).
​
  
​
The assigned treatment dose (FOS 20 mg/kg, LEV 60
 
mg/kg or VPA 40 mg/kg) will be infused over 10 minutes.  The
​
 
​
study participants will be
 
observed for 20 minutes, while the duration of clinical seizures and response to verbal or
 
painful stimuli is recorded.  At 60 minutes from start of study drug infusion, the primary
 
outcome is determined.
 
Randomization:
​
 Any patient witnessed to have seizures in the emergency department (ED) will
 
be evaluated for enrollment based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Enrollment will occur
 
under exception from informed consent rules (EFIC) due to the emergent and life-threatening
 
nature of SE.  This is an intent-to-treat study so all subjects randomized will be included in the
 
primary analysis.  Time of randomization is the time when the infusion pump, connected to
 
study drug vial and patient’s IV catheter, is switched on. The randomization scheme will be
 
equal allocation (1:1:1) for the first 300 patients. Once 300 subjects are randomized,
 
response-adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of maximizing the
 
likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm.
 
 
Interim  Analyses: 
​
Interim monitoring for success and futility will begin after 400 subjects have
 
been enrolled and will be repeated after every additional 100 subjects are enrolled . This trial
 
will stop early for success if the analysis identifies the maximum effective treatment with at
 
least 97.5% probability.
 
Sample Size: 
​
This study will  randomize a maximum target of 795 subjects over 4 years, at an
 
accrual rate of approximately 16.5 subjects per month.  This sample size provides
 
approximately  90% power to identify the most effective treatment when one treatment arm
 
has a true response rate of 65% and the true response rate is 50% in the other two arms (an
 
absolute difference of 15% ).  A 15% difference is the minimum clinically important difference
 
sufficient to change clinical practice. The trial operating characteristics for this adaptive design
 
were determined via an extensive simulation study, which ensures the type I error probability is
 
less than 0.05 under a variety of scenarios.
​
37
 
Participating Sites:
​
 Patients will be recruited by two national emergency research networks:
 
Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT) network and Pediatric Emergency Care
 
Applied Research Network (PECARN).  Each network has successfully participated in SE
 
treatment trials in compliance with EFIC regulations.

1. STUDY OBJECTIVES
 
1.1 Primary Objective
 
The primary objective is to determine the most effective and/or the least effective treatment
 
(between fosphenytoin, levetiracetam and valproic acid) of benzodiazepine-refractory SE
 
among patients greater than or equal to 2 years.  
​
 
​
The  primary outcome is clinical cessation of
 
status epilepticus, determined by the absence of clinically apparent seizures and improving
 
responsiveness, at 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion, without the use of
 
additional anti-seizure medication.
 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives
 
Secondary objectives include: determination of the relative safety of the treatment arms on
 
defined safety outcomes and all adverse events, analysis of secondary efficacy outcomes, and
 
evaluation of both effectiveness and safety in the pediatric subpopulation.

2. BACKGROUND
 
2.1 Rationale
 
SE is defined as a prolonged self-sustaining seizure or recurrent seizures without recovery of
 
consciousness between seizures (Lowenstein 1999).  Epidemiological studies carried out in
 
Richmond, VA, found an annual incidence of SE ranging from 41/100,000-61/100,000
 
(DeLorenzo 1996).  Based on these studies, there are approximately 120,000-180,000 episodes
 
of convulsive SE each year in the US.  SE affects individuals of all ages from the very young to
 
the elderly.  It complicates many neurological and systemic illnesses.  The mortality associated
 
with SE is estimated as 17%.  SE also leads to morbidity including cognitive defects and
 
neurological injury.  The morbidity and mortality of SE is determined by the underlying cause of
 
the SE and the length of time in SE (Neligan 2010; Towne 1994). The Febrile status epilepticus
 
study (FEBSTAT) suggests that SE, but not individual seizures, injures the hippocampus (Nordli,
 
2012; Shinnar 2012).  Early termination of SE can limit development of refractory SE,
 
neurological injury and mortality in experimental animals (Fujikawa 2005; Kapur 1997).  SE is
 
particularly common in children (Shinnar . 1997).  Although multiple different etiologies such as
 
infection, tumors, fever, preexisting neurological injury or brain malformation cause SE, the
 
primary goal of treatment is prompt termination of seizures because adverse consequences of
 
SE increase with seizure duration (Chen 2007; Lothman 1990; Meldrum 1973; Meldrum 1986).
 
 
SE is initially treated with benzodiazepines. This selection is based on three double-blind,
 
randomized, controlled clinical trials (Alldredge 2001; Treiman 1998, SIlbergleit 2012).  In the
 
VA Cooperative Study (Treiman 1998), intravenous lorazepam was found to be superior to
 
phenytoin.  In the Pre-hospital Treatment of Status Epilepticus (PHTSE) study (Alldredge 2001),
 
lorazepam and diazepam were found to be superior to placebo.  In these studies, lorazepam
 
was effective in terminating SE in 55-65% of patients. The recently published RAMPART study
 
compared intramuscular midazolam to intravenous lorazepam for the initial treatment of SE
 
(Silbergleit 2012).  It concluded that intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as
 
intravenous lorazepam for patients in convulsive status epilepticus (Silbergleit 2012).
 
Benzodiazepines are also the first treatment of choice in children (Loddenkemper 2011).  The
 
recently published Pediatric Seizure Study found that lorazepam was not superior to diazepam
 
for pediatric SE (Chamberlain 2014).  Unfortunately, approximately 35-45% of patients are
 
refractory to benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine-refractory SE is also called established SE.
 
ESETT is a clinical trial testing the relative efficacy and safety of three treatments in patients
 
who do not respond to benzodiazepine treatment (Cock 2011; Prasad 2005).  The need for such
 
a trial has been emphasized in review articles, guidelines and by experts in the field (Lowenstein
 
2005;Meierkord 2010; Wheless 2008).
 
For the purpose of this trial, “established SE (ESE)” is defined as an episode of generalized
 
convulsive SE in which seizure activity continues despite administration of adequate doses of
 
 
 
14
  
benzodiazepines.  It has long been recognized that SE is a dynamic and rapidly evolving
 
condition which eventually becomes self-sustaining (Lothman 1990; Lothman 1989; Treiman
 
1990; VanLandingham 1991a; VanLandingham 1991b).  Ongoing seizures rapidly modify
 
neuronal activity and synaptic function (Chen 2007; Macdonald 1999).  This rapid neuronal
 
plasticity is manifested in changes in seizure behavior, EEG patterns, sensitivity to drugs, and
 
evolution of neuronal injury and death.  EEGs recorded from patients soon after onset of
 
generalized convulsive SE demonstrate discrete seizures interspersed with normal activity,
 
which evolves to continuous waxing and waning spike–wave discharges (Treiman 1990).
 
Benzodiazepines given soon after the onset of generalized convulsive status epilepticus are
 
effective in terminating seizures in 60-72% of patients.  As time passes,  these drugs become far
 
less effective, terminating seizures in less than 25% of patients (Treiman 1998).
 
Benzodiazepines act on GABA-A receptors and enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission
 
(Goodkin 2009).  In experimental animals, benzodiazepines terminate seizures effectively if
 
they are given soon after the start of seizures--when EEG demonstrates recurrent seizures and
 
behavioral seizures are mild.  Benzodiazepines are less effective in treating longer lasting SE,
 
especially after electrographic seizures have merged and 10 or more minutes have elapsed
 
since first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (Jones 2002; Kapur 1997; Walton 1988; Wang 2009).
 
Studies further reveal that inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by GABA-A receptors is
 
reduced in the hippocampi of animals in ESE (Goodkin 2008; Kapur 1995; Kapur 1997; Naylor
 
2005; Terunuma 2008). Biochemical studies reveal a decrease in the number of functional
 
receptors on the post-synaptic membrane in the hippocampi of animals in established SE
 
(Goodkin 2005; Goodkin 2008; Naylor 2005; Terunuma 2008).  This rapid receptor plasticity is
 
believed to be mediated by prolonged seizures, which activate many second messenger
 
pathways (Brunig 2001; Pal 2001).  In summary, prolonged seizures modify GABA-A receptors
 
and lead to ESE.
 
 
Further treatment should ideally focus on mechanisms other than GABA-A receptors, such as
 
sodium channels, calcium channels, or glutamatergic transmission. Currently, there are several
 
drugs available in the intravenous formulation that can modify these systems.  Lacosamide and
 
FOS modify sodium channels.  LEV modifies glutamatergic synaptic transmission by binding to
 
the synaptic vesicle proteins.  VPA  has multiple actions on several neurotransmitter systems
 
and ion channels.  These mechanisms are described in the respective package inserts.
 
 
 
2.2 Study Drugs
 
The primary goal of treatment of ESE is to terminate seizures rapidly, without causing
 
respiratory or cardiovascular compromise, or coma.  The active form of the drug must enter the
 
brain rapidly, access its target and stop ESE. Three drugs were selected for this study based on
 
 
 
15
  
current recommendations of professional groups, current clinical practice, and safety and
 
efficacy data.
 
Recently, the Status Epilepticus Guideline Writing Committee of the Neurocritical Care Society
 
(NCS) reviewed current evidence and classified it according to American Heart
 
Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines for evidence rating (Brophy 2012).  The
 
Neurocritical Care Society rated common anticonvulsants for the treatment of SE as follows:
 
VPA
​
:  Class IIa, level A—weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy based on
 
data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials.
 
FOS
​
:  Class IIa, level B--weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy based on
 
data derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized trials.
 
LEV
​
:  Class IIb, level C--weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy based on
 
consensus opinion of experts.
 
These three medications are sometimes referred to by certain brand names.  Fosphenytoin may
 
referred to as Cerebyx or, inaccurately, as Dilantin, the brand name of the active metabolite of
 
this pro-drug.  Levetiracetam may be referred to as Keppra.  Valproic acid may be referred to as
 
Depacon or Depakote.
 
The NCS guidelines recommended use of either FOS or VPA for the treatment of established SE
 
(Brophy 2012).
 
To identify current practice, a critical care pharmacy group studied the patterns of
 
anticonvulsant use for benzodiazepine refractory status epilepticus in the neurocritical care
 
units.  This survey analyzed the medical records of 10-20 recent SE patients from the critical
 
care units at 15 academic medical centers.   Among the 150 patients studied, benzodiazepines
 
were the most commonly used first agent (75%) for treatment of SE.  FOS was the most
 
commonly used second anticonvulsant (33%).  LEV was less commonly used (10%) and VPA was
 
rarely used (<2 %) (Cook 2012).  The NCS Status Epilepticus Guideline Writing Committee
 
reported the preferences of 50 identified experts among neurointensivists, neurologists and
 
epileptologists for the treatment of ESE.  Among the respondents for this survey, 80% chose
 
FOS (or phenytoin), 6% chose LEV and 2% chose VPA (Riviello 2006).  In a survey of 21 pediatric
 
ED directors from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied  Research Network (PECARN), FOS was
 
the most commonly used treatment for ESE in pediatric patients followed by LEV,
 
phenobarbital, and VPA.
 
Intravenous formulations are available for FOS, LEV, VPA, lacosamide and  phenobarbital. Of
 
these drugs, phenobarbital causes sedation and respiratory depression, especially in those who
 
have been treated with benzodiazepines. This side effect limits the popularity of phenobarbital
 
 
 
16
  
as a second line agent for SE.  The safety of rapid intravenous administration of lacosamide has
 
been established in adults but not in children (Fountain 2012).  Children constitute a large
 
fraction of patients with SE.  Three hundred thirty-six of approximately 795 of subjects to be
 
randomized into this study will be children.  There are limited data on the efficacy of
 
lacosamide in established SE, especially in children.  For these reasons, lacosamide and
 
phenobarbital were not included in the study.
 
2.3  FOS (fosphenytoin)
 
FOS is the most commonly recommended treatment for ESE in many current treatment
 
guidelines (Brophy 2012; Loddenkemper 2011; Meierkord 2010) and is generally considered the
 
standard of care.  In a survey of critical care neurologists published in 2003, 95% of responders
 
(n= 106) used FOS or phenytoin for the treatment of ESE (Claassen 2003).  Two more recent
 
surveys suggest that it is currently the most commonly used drug for the treatment of ESE in
 
the US (Cook 2012; Riviello 2012). A survey of pediatric ED physicians belonging to the Pediatric
 
Emergency Care Action Research Network (PECARN) reported that the majority of physicians
 
treating children use FOS for the treatment of ESE.
 
Pharmacokinetics, dose and rate of administration:  In order to achieve rapid termination of
 
seizures, drugs need to be administered rapidly.  Drugs are delivered over a 10 minute infusion
 
period in ESETT.  FOS can  be administered at a maximum rate of 150 mg/min in order to avoid
 
hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias (see boxed warning, package insert).  This limits the
 
maximum dose of the drug that can be administered safely over 10 minutes to 1500 mg.  The
 
recommended loading dose of FOS is 18-20 mg/kg.  Therefore, patients weighing less than 75
 
kg will receive a loading dose 20 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  Those weighing 75 kg or more will
 
receive a fixed dose of 1500 mg over 10 minutes.  Because more than 65% of adult men and
 
45% of adult women weigh more than 75 kg, weight-based dosing will typically apply to
 
children and fixed dosing to adults.  This dosing regimen is consistent with current
 
recommendation for the use of anticonvulsants, where children are dosed on a mg/kg basis
 
while adults are given fixed doses (see package insert phenytoin, LEV, and VPA).  In general,
 
children are given larger doses of anticonvulsants because of differences in the
 
pharmacokinetics.

Figure 1.  (Fischer 2003)
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of FOS (1200 mg) administered at the rate of 150 mg phenytoin
 
equivalents (PE)/min is illustrated in Figure 1 (Fischer 2003). Most clinically relevant is panel d
 
showing unbound (free) phenytoin plasma concentrations following administration.  These
 
remain in 2.0- 3.0 mg/L range 90 minutes after administration.  The accepted therapeutic range
 
of unbound plasma concentration is 1 to 2 mg/L.  Patients receiving a single dose of FOS (1500
 
mg) are expected to maintain a free phenytoin concentration above 2 mg/L for 90 to 120
 
minutes. It is thus reasonable in the patient who has stopped seizing to wait for 2 hours from
 
start of infusion to start or restart anticonvulsant medication.
 
FOS is a prodrug which must be converted to phenytoin (PHT) to exert its action (Walton 1990).
 
FOS has to undergo dephosphorylation before it can enter the brain. Figure 2 illustrates the
 
rate of accumulation of PHT in rat plasma and brain after single intraperitoneal injection of FOS
 
(called ACC 9653 at the time of publication) or PHT (Walton 1990). Note that peak plasma PHT
 
concentration was achieved 30 minutes after FOS injection. The peak brain PHT level was
 
attained 60 minutes after administration. PHT is effective against partial onset seizures and
 
secondarily generalized seizures, but its efficacy in primary generalized seizures is not
 
established.  It exerts its anticonvulsant action by stabilizing the inactivated state of sodium
 
channels (Macdonald 1994). FOS gets converted into phenytoin and enters the brain. FOS can
 
be administered faster than phenytoin.
 
 
 
 
18
  
       Figure 2.  (Walton 1990)
 
Safety:  According to the package insert, the dose of IV FOS (15 to 20 mg PE/kg) that is used to
 
treat status epilepticus is administered at a maximum rate of 150 mg PE/min to avoid
 
cardiovascular side effects.  Hypotension may occur, especially after IV administration at high
 
doses and high rates of administration.  Severe cardiovascular reactions and fatalities, such as
 
atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation, have been reported
 
following PHT administration, especially in elderly or gravely ill patients. These complications
 
are less frequent with FOS, but careful cardiac monitoring is still needed when administering IV
 
loading doses of FOS. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be
 
necessary. This ESETT protocol calls for these reductions if needed while administering the
 
study drug.
 
 
Rash: Exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous, rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal
 
necrolysis are known to occur with chronic administration of PHT.
 
 
Hepatotoxicity: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic
 
failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These incidents have been associated with a
 
hypersensitivity syndrome characterized by fever, skin eruptions, and lymphadenopathy, and
 
usually occur within the first 2 months of treatment. Other common manifestations include
 
jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia.
 
The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal
 
outcomes.
 
Hemopoietic system:  thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and
 
 
 
19
  
pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression have been reported.
 
Prenatal exposure to phenytoin was not found to have additional significant clinical risk in a
 
recent Cochrane meta-analysis (Bromley 2014).  Theoretical risks are related to prolonged
 
exposures rather than single dose exposures as in this trial.  Theoretical risks include  congenital
 
malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Increased frequencies of major
 
malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), minor anomalies (dysmorphic facial
 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia), growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and mental
 
deficiency have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin
 
alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Patients known to be
 
pregnant will be excluded from this trial anyway as per the secretarial waiver allowing studies
 
with EFIC.
 
Efficacy in animal studies:  Fosphenytoin and PHT are not effective in termination of
 
benzodiazepine refractory SE in animal model ESE.  In an electrical stimulation model where
 
excitatory inputs to the hippocampus were stimulated (perforant path) for 60 minutes, the
 
resulting in-animal model ESE was not terminated by phenytoin ( 50 mg/kg) given intravenously
 
(Mazarati 1998).  In another animal model of ESE based on electrical stimulation of the
 
hippocampus for 90 minutes, phenytoin did not suppress seizures (Prasad 2002).  Finally, in a
 
cholinergic stimulation (nerve agent-induced) animal model ESE, FOS had little or no
 
therapeutic effect either administered alone or in combination with diazepam (McDonough
 
2004).
 
Efficacy in open studies:  In open-label studies for initial treatment of SE, the reported efficacy
 
of PHT in terminating SE ranges from 44-88%  (Trinka 2009).  In the VA Cooperative study
 
(Treiman 1998), PHT was effective in initial treatment of convulsive SE in 42% of patients, but in
 
only 7.7 % patients with subtle SE.  Effectiveness in ESE was not studied.   A systematic,
 
retrospective analysis concluded that phenytoin was effective in 58.6% of patients with SE who
 
did not respond to benzodiazepines (Alvarez 2011).
 
 
2.4  LEV (levetiracetam)
 
Recently published guidelines for  the treatment of ESE in adults and children recommend LEV
 
as an alternative to FOS (Brophy 2012; Loddenkemper 2011; Meierkord 2010).  In surveys of
 
experts and pediatric ED physicians, LEV is the second most commonly used drug for the
 
treatment of ESE in neurological intensive care units (Cook 2012; Riviello 2012).  It is used for
 
the treatment of partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic seizures and seizures
 
associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.  It binds to synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2)  and
 
modulates neurotransmission.  An intravenous formulation of the drug has been available for
 
several years and it is labelled for use when patients cannot swallow or for initiating therapy for
 
 
 
20
  
seizure.
 
 
Pharmacokinetics & safety:  Doheny et al investigated the plasma and brain concentrations of
 
LEV after bolus intraperitoneal injection of 20, 40 or 80 mg/kg of the drug to rats. Serum LEV
 
concentration increases and peaks rapidly,  but brain accumulation is slow and peaks 90-100
 
minutes after administration (Doheny 1999).
 
 
Dose and rate of administration:  The recommended LEV dose in children up to 40 kg is 20-60
 
mg/kg per day (package insert).  In adults, the recommended dose range is 1-3 g per day, but
 
higher doses up to 6 g per day are commonly used.  The safety of rapid intravenous
 
administration of LEV has been assessed.  Intravenous doses of 2500 mg have been
 
administered over 5 minutes and doses of 4000 mg have been given over 15 minutes safely in
 
adults (Ramael 2006a).  The common adverse effects in these patients were dizziness,
 
somnolence, irritability and headache (Ramael 2006a). Based on these considerations, subjects
 
weighing up to 75 kg will receive a loading dose 60 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  Those weighing 75
 
kg or more will receive a fixed dose of 4500 mg over 10 minutes.
 
  Figure 3.  (Ramael 2006b)
 
Figure 3 demonstrates the pharmacokinetics of LEV following injection of 2000, 3000 or 4000
 
mg of the drug (Ramael 2006b).  It is noteworthy that within 15 minutes of injection the plasma
 
concentration of LEV peaks and remains above 40 µg /ml for 9 hours. The therapeutic
 
concentration of LEV is considered to be 12 to 46 µg /ml.  Therefore, patients treated with LEV
 
are likely to have therapeutic concentrations of the drug for 8 to 10 hours after the start of
 
infusion.
 
Safety: Suicidal ideation: Chronic administration of LEV increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or
 
behavior. Patients treated with LEV for should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of
 
depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.
 
 
 
21
  
Risk of suicidal ideation associated with a single dose of LEV is unknown.
 
 
CNS:  CNS effects include somnolence and fatigue, coordination difficulties, and behavioral
 
abnormalities observed in pediatric and adult population.
 
Hematopoietic:  Minor, but statistically significant, decreases in total mean RBC count (0.03 x
 
106/mm3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in
 
LEV-treated adult and pediatric patients in placebo-controlled trials.
 
Pregnancy Risks:  The best available evidence is that there are no risks related to pregnancy
 
from the administration of levetiracetam in humans.  Current data suggests that the overall risk
 
of major malformation after first trimester exposure to levetiracetam is within the population
 
baseline risk of 1-3%, with no apparent adverse effects on long term child development. The
 
effect of a single dose of LEV has not been studied, but would be of lower risk than repeated
 
dosing (Chaudhry SA, 2014, Bromley 2014).
 
 
Efficacy in animal model ESE:  LEV administered alone reduced the duration of  perforant path
 
stimulation–induced animal ESE (Mazarati 2004).  When used in combination with diazepam,
 
low doses of LEV rapidly terminated behavioral and EEG seizures (Mazarati 2004).  In the
 
cholinergic stimulation animal model of ESE, LEV administered alone suppressed behavioral
 
seizures, but EEG seizures continued unabated (Zheng 2010).
 
Efficacy in open studies:  Although no randomized controlled clinical trial for this agent has
 
been performed, a large number of open case series and reports have been published.  An
 
analysis of publications until 2009 reported that 707 patients with various forms of SE had been
 
treated with LEV.  The success rate was about 70% (Trinka 2011).  In ESE, the efficacy of LEV is
 
reported as 51.7 % in one study (Alvarez 2011) and 73.2% in another study (Tripathi 2010).
 
 
2.5  VPA (valproic acid)
 
VPA was recommended for the treatment of ESE in recent guidelines (Brophy 2012; Meierkord
 
2010). In surveys, VPA is the third or 4
​
th
​
 most commonly used dr ug for the treatment of ESE in
 
the U.S. (Cook 2012; Riviello 2012).  VPA is an anticonvulsant commonly used for the treatment
 
of primary generalized seizures, myoclonic seizures and focal seizures. The drug has multiple
 
actions on the GABA neurotransmitter system and calcium channels (Macdonald 1995).
 
Valproate sodium is the salt of the valproate ion which is synonymous with VPA.
 
 
 
22
  
  Figure 4.  (Limdi 2007)
 
Pharmacokinetics:  Subjects weighing up to 75 kg will receive a loading dose of 40 mg/kg over
 
10 minutes.  Those weighing 75 kg or more will receive a fixed dose of 3000 mg over 10
 
minutes. Based on published pharmacokinetic data (Limdi 2007), serum VPA levels will peak
 
between 150-200 mg/L within minutes of administration and then remain in the 50-150 mg/L
 
range for the next 4 hours (see Figure 4).  Pharmacokinetics of IV VPA has been studied in
 
children with epilepsy (Birnbaum 2003; Panomvana Na 2006; Ramsay 2003; Visudtibhan 2011;
 
Williams 2012).  Recent studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of rapid intravenously
 
administered  VPA conforms to models developed using oral VPA in children and oral and
 
intravenous VPA in adults (Williams 2012).  Intravenous VPA is safe in acutely ill children with
 
recurrent seizures and in those with epilepsy (Birnbaum 2003; Ramsay 2003).
 
Dose and rate of administration: Recommended VPA dose ranges from 15-45 mg/kg/day.  VPA
 
has been administered rapidly by the intravenous route.  In one study it was administered at
 
the rate of up to 10 mg/kg/minute for doses up to 30 mg/kg (Limdi 2005).  In another study in
 
children it was given at rates up to 11 mg/kg/min for dose up to 40 mg/kg (Venkataraman 1999;
 
Wheless 2004). The most common adverse events were injection site pain, pain with infusion,
 
dizziness, and somnolence. Based on these considerations, subjects weighing up to 75 kg will
 
receive a loading dose of 40 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  Those weighing 75 kg or more will receive
 
a fixed dose of 3000 mg over 10 minutes.
 
Safety in pregnant women  Children born to mothers taking long durations of high doses of VPA
 
during pregnancy may have a higher than expected  incidence of reduced  cognitive
 
performance at ages 3 and 4.5 (McVearry 2009; Meador 2009; Werler 2011).  These risks  are
 
dose dependent and vary across studies.  They have only been found to be are associated with
 
chronic administration of VPA (Bromley 2014).  There is no evidence that a single dose of VPA
 
 
 
23
  
given during pregnancy can cause birth defects.
 
In a series of reviews of hepatotoxicity associated with VPA, Dreifuss and colleagues concluded
 
that the
​
 
​
 primary risk of fatal hepatic dysfunction (1/500) was fou nd in children 0 to 2 years old
 
receiving VPA as polytherapy. The risk declined with age and was low in patients receiving VPA
 
as monotherapy (1/37,000). No hepatic fatalities occurred in patients above the age of 10 years
 
receiving VPA as monotherapy (Bryant 1996; Dreifuss 1987; Dreifuss 1989).  There are reports
 
that polymerase c gene (POLG) determines the risk of VPA -induced hepatotoxicity (Stewart
 
2010).   However, the POLG polymorphisms were discovered in patients who had been
 
chronically treated with VPA and had elevated hepatic enzymes.  The authors concluded that
 
the genetic variants reduced the regenerative capacity of the hepatocytes following injury.
 
Patients with mutations in POLG have metabolic encephalopathy. There is no report of
 
hepatotoxicity associated with a single dose of VPA.  Patients below age 2, and those with
 
known or suspected metabolic encephalopathy are excluded from  ESETT.
 
 
Exclusion of patients known to be pregnant, younger than 2 years and with known or suspected
 
metabolic encephalopathy will reduce the possibility of VPA exposure to the population at risk
 
for toxicity.  There is a small risk that a pregnant patient who is not identified as pregnant by
 
history or physical examination will be included in the study.  The risk of toxicity is mitigated by
 
the fact that a single dose of VPA will be used.  This risk should be weighed against the known
 
morbidity and mortality of ESE and compared to the risk of administering FOS.
 
Clinical studies:  VPA has been used for the treatment of SE in prospective or retrospective
 
series and two randomized open trials (Trinka 2009). An analysis of these trials reported that
 
693 adults or children in SE have been treated with VPA and the response rate ranging from 60-
 
83% of patients.  A pilot prospective randomized open study reported a trend towards
 
superiority of VPA to phenytoin in treatment of SE (Misra 2006).  Another study reported that
 
VPA controlled SE refractory to PHT (Agarwal 2007).
 
2.6  Systematic comparison of FOS, VPA, and LEV for the treatment of ESE
 
There is one systematic study of treatment of ESE (Alvarez 2011).  In a retrospective analysis of
 
protocol-driven treatment of ESE,  279 adult episodes of SE were identified prospectively in
 
which either PHT or VPA or LEV was given in a non-randomized un-blinded fashion after
 
benzodiazepines failed (labeled Alvarez in figure 5 below). VPA failed to control SE in 25.4%,
 
PHT in 41.4% and LEV in 48.3% of episodes.  Because patients were not balanced with regards
 
to etiology and severity of SE, a post-hoc adjustment for severity and etiology was performed.
 
After this adjustment the authors reported that LEV failed more often than VPA (Odds ratio
 
(OR) 2.69: 95% confidence interval 1.16-6.08)).  PHT was not significantly different from the
 
other two compounds. The authors concluded that LEV is less effective than VPA for control of
 
 
 
24
  
ESE and called for a prospective randomized trial of these agents.
 
 
Two ESE treatment studies were open-label, randomized, prospective studies.  In the first study
 
(labeled Agarwal on figure 5), one hundred patients aged two or older who had failed IV
 
diazepam were randomized to either 20 mg/kg of VPA or 20 mg/kg of PHT.  SE was controlled in
 
44 (88%) patients treated with VPA and 42 (81%) patients treated with PHT (Agarwal 2007).  No
 
significant difference was found between VPA and PHT in this open-labeled study.  In the
 
second study (Tripathi 2010)  patients were randomized  to IV LEV or IV VPA after failing
 
diazepam treatment of SE.  Status epilepticus was terminated by IV LEV in 30 patients and by IV
 
VPA in 28 patients.  In this study as well, there was no significant difference between LEV and
 
VPA.  In summary, one large head-to-head comparison of these three agents raised the
 
possibility that VPA is superior to LEV for the treatment of ESE.  The other studies were
 
inconclusive.  Expert evaluation of the published data suggests that VPA (Class IIa level A) may
 
be superior to  FOS (Class IIa level B), which may be superior to LEV (class IIb level C).
 
 
 
Figure 5.  (Agarwal 2007, Alvarez 2011, Tripathi 2010)
 
In summary, current practice is to treat ESE with FOS or LEV.  However no randomized
 
controlled trials have demonstrated their efficacy in terminating ESE.  Non-randomized and
 
pilot studies suggest VPA may be more efficacious than LEV.  Most expert ED physicians,
 
neurologists, neuro-intensivists and pediatric neurologists believe that the next logical step is a
 
randomized, blinded comparative efficacy study to decide the best treatment for ESE (Brophy
 
2012; Cock 2011; Loddenkemper 2011; Shorvon 2011; Trinka 2009).

3. STUDY DESIGN
 
This is a multicenter, randomized, Bayesian response-adaptive comparative effectiveness trial
 
of three active treatments in patients with established SE who have failed treatment with
 
benzodiazepines. Subjects will initially be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Once 300 subjects are
 
randomized, response-adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of
 
maximizing the likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm.  Interim analyses are
 
planned after 400, 500, 600, and 700 subjects are enrolled.  At each interim analysis, there may
 
be updates to the randomization probabilities. At each interim analysis, the trial may stop early
 
for success or futility. The maximum approximate sample size is 795 subjects total.

4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF SUBJECTS
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria
 
Patients will be included in this study if they are aged 2 or older, have been treated for
 
generalized convulsive seizure of greater than 5 minutes duration with adequate doses of
 
benzodiazepines, and who continue to have persistent or recurrent convulsions in the
 
emergency department at least 5 minutes and no more than 30 minutes after the last dose of
 
benzodiazepine.  The inclusion criteria is intended to describe the population of patients for
 
whom progression to second line anticonvulsants are indicated.  The seizure and its initial
 
treatment may have occurred prior to arrival in the ED.
 
Adequate doses of benzodiazepines for this study are determined to be: diazepam 10 mg IV,
 
lorazepam 4 mg IV or midazolam 10 mg IV or IM for those greater than or equal to 40 kg.  For
 
children less than 40 kg adequate doses are: diazepam 0.3 mg/kg IV, lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV
 
and midazolam 0.3mg/kg IM or 0.2 mg/kg IV.  These drugs may have been administered in two
 
or more divided doses.  The last dose of benzodiazepine must be given at least 5 minutes prior
 
study drug initiation to provide this dose sufficient time to act.  The last dose of benzodiazepine
 
must be given within 30 minutes of study drug initiation to avoid enrolling patients in whom
 
re-dosing of benzodiazepines may be more appropriate.  Transmucosal benzodiazepines such
 
as rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam given at home prior to EMS arrival may be included in
 
the calculation of the cumulative adequate benzodiazepine dose, but at least one dose of
 
benzodiazepines must be also given by EMS or in the ED between 5 and 30 minutes of study
 
drug administration. There is no maximum dose of benzodiazepines  imposed by this trial.
 
Although these doses are considered the minimum adequate doses based on common clinical
 
practice, it is recommended that the best practice (subject to local standards of care) is to
 
administer 20 mg of diazepam, 8 mg of lorazepam, or 20 mg of midazolam in adults prior to
 
progression to enrollment.

5. Informed Consent and Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC)
 
Respect for human subjects and their safety are paramount in this trial.  Research involving
 
subjects who have SE, however, presents an ethical challenge.  Protecting patient autonomy
 
through the informed consent process is typically an ethical cornerstone of human subjects
 
research, but because patients in generalized SE are unconscious, an informed consent process
 
is not possible and patients cannot say whether or not they would want to participate in the
 
research.  Furthermore the alternative process of identifying and obtaining surrogate informed
 
consent from a legally authorized representative (LAR) is not practicable in SE, because the
 
emergency treatment being studied must be initiated as quickly as possible to safely care for
 
the patient.  Identification of the optimal emergency care for those in SE in this trial can
 
therefore only be conducted with exception from informed consent (EFIC) for emergency
 
research.  This section will explain the processes used in this trial and the detailed rationale for
 
compliance with the FDA regulations for EFIC found at 21 CFR 50.24.
 
5.1  Enrollments all performed under EFIC
 
All participants will be enrolled under EFIC.  In this trial there will be no circumstance in which
 
an informed consent process can be meaningfully or safely performed.  All patients eligible for
 
this trial must be unconscious from generalized SE, so no one can consent for themselves, and
 
the rapidity with which treatment is needed for SE precludes obtaining consent from parents
 
and other legally authorized representatives (LAR) even if they are present.  Emergency
 
treatment must be given quickly because every minute of delay decreases the likelihood that an
 
anticonvulsant medication will be effective at terminating seizures, and patient morbidity and
 
mortality increase with increasing seizure duration.  Therefore, the delay related to any
 
meaningful and compliant informed consent process is unsafe, impracticable, and would not be
 
ethical.  It is also not practicable to identify and consent patients prior to developing SE as
 
35-50% of patients who have SE are new onset, and even in patients with epilepsy, SE is a
 
relatively uncommon and unpredictable manifestation.  It is not possible to predict who will
 
have SE.
 
 
A more detailed EFIC Plan document for the trial can be found in the Manual of Procedures
 
(MoP).  The investigational new drug application for this trial is identified as using EFIC.
 
Investigators at each site will perform community consultation and public disclosure as
 
discussed below, and these will be reviewed and approved by local institutional review boards
 
prior to starting the trial at the site.
 
 
5.2  Consent to Continue Participation
 
 
Subjects or their LAR will be notified of enrollment as early as possible and consent to continue
 
participation in the study will be sought for all subjects.
 
 
 
 
31
  
Attempts are typically initiated in the ED by the study team to discuss the enrollment with the
 
subject in those subjects who are waking up, or to locate and communicate with an LAR for
 
subjects who are not waking up.   When a subject or LAR are first available to participate in an
 
informed consent process, they will be asked to continue participation in the study.
 
Continuation in the study only involves further review of the subject’s medical record through
 
the shorter of hospital discharge or 30 days.  Those wishing to continue will have the informed
 
consent document explained to them, will have any questions answered, and they will be asked
 
to review and sign the informed consent document.  In those who wish to discontinue
 
participation, no further data will be collected.  Data collected prior to withdrawal will remain
 
in the study database as per FDA requirements and guidance.  Those wishing to discontinue
 
participation will also have the informed consent document explained to them, will have any
 
questions answered and will be asked to review and sign an informed withdrawal from the
 
study, however, subjects are not required to complete this document in order to withdraw.
 
Standard consent procedures will be used. A copy of a model informed consent document will
 
be provided to sites.
 
If a subject is randomized into ESETT and dies before a legally authorized representative or
 
family member can be contacted, a reliable mailing address for the subject’s family or LAR will
 
be obtained.  After allowing a two to four week period of grieving, the site study team will send
 
a letter with basic information about the clinical investigation, the subject’s inclusion, and
 
contact information so that families can call or write to obtain more information or to get
 
questions answered if desired.
 
5.3  Assessment of Notification and Consent Processes
 
 
Notification and informed consent logs are incorporated in the study case report forms and will
 
allow tracking and reporting of the timeliness of these processes.  In addition, subjects and
 
LAR’s participating in notification and consent processes may be offered an opportunity to
 
share their experience and attitudes by answering a standardized survey up to day following an
 
informed consent or withdrawal.  This information will be used for process improvement and to
 
better understand the subject or LAR perspective on emergency research.
 
5.4  Compliance with Criteria and Processes Required for EFIC
 
FDA regulations identify the specific circumstances in which EFIC is appropriate.  ESETT fulfills
 
these requirements for emergency research.  In the following section, the components of the
 
regulation are reproduced, along with an explanation of how ESETT will comply with each
 
requirement.
 
 
SE is life-threatening and available treatments are unsatisfactory or unproven.
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments
 
 
 
32
  
are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include
 
evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to
 
determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.
 
Population studies of the incidence of SE report an incidence of between 41-61/100,000.  The
 
mortality rate is estimated to be greater than 17% (Neligan 2010).
 
The Cochrane review of anticonvulsant therapy for SE found eleven studies with 2017 subjects.
 
The review concluded that lorazepam was the most effective agent and will terminate SE in
 
only 60-70% of patients with this life-threatening condition.  Because 30-40% of patients do not
 
respond to first-line therapy for SE, benzodiazepines are unsatisfactory on their own.  The three
 
anticonvulsant medications studied in this trial are often used as second-line therapy to treat
 
these patients but are unproven.  There are no randomized, prospective, adequately controlled
 
trials to confirm whether one or more of these medications are either effective or safe in these
 
patients.
 
 
Clinical trials are clearly needed.  No blinded, sufficiently powered prospective, randomized
 
controlled trial has compared treatments for seizures refractory to initial benzodiazepine
 
treatment. Currently published treatment guidelines recommend intravenous FOS as
 
second-line treatment, with LEV and VPA as alternatives (Brophy 2012; Loddenkemper 2011;
 
Meierkord 2010).  However, there are small, open-label randomized studies that suggest the
 
potential efficacy of VPA over LEV in treatment of ESE (Alvarez 2011).  A series of clinical
 
observations suggest that LEV and VPA are safe and effective in the treatment of ESE (Trinka
 
2009; Trinka 2011).
 
Obtaining prospective informed consent is not feasible.
 
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because: (i) the subjects will not be
 
able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition; (ii) the intervention
 
under investigation must be administered before consent from the subjects' legally authorized
 
representatives is feasible; and (iii) There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the
 
individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation.
 
Subjects in generalized status epilepticus are unconscious and unable to provide informed
 
consent due to their medical condition. The care of patients in status epilepticus must be
 
initiated immediately, which, in the Emergency Department care of patients with
 
benzodiazepine refractory SE is the immediate initiation of second line anticonvulsant therapy.
 
 
Complications of prolonged seizures include impaired ventilation and subsequent pulmonary
 
aspiration, cardiac dysrhythmias, derangements of metabolic and autonomic function, and
 
direct injury to the nervous system.  Seizures of short duration may be clinically benign, but
 
longer durations are associated with increasingly severe morbidity and mortality. There is no
 
specific identifiable threshold for seizure duration that predicts the onset of morbidity, and
 
 
 
33
  
thus, clinical practice is geared toward terminating seizures as quickly as possible.
 
 
Clinical data have demonstrated the duration of SE is associated with death and unfavorable
 
neurologic outcomes (Maegaki 2005, Holtkamp 2005). While many of these data concern long
 
durations of SE lasting hours or days, data also suggest that differences of as little as a few
 
minutes in seizure duration are also associated with differences in outcome. Patients found in
 
SE by paramedics who had termination of their seizures prior to arrival to the emergency
 
department have an ICU admission rate of 32% as compared to 73% in patients whose seizures
 
persisted on arrival to the ED. In a randomized trial, patients with SE treated with lorazepam or
 
diazepam in the field by paramedics had mortality at hospital discharge of 7.7% and 4.5%
 
respectively, which was less than half the mortality of 15.7% for patients in whom
 
benzodiazepines were given only after arrival in the ED (Alldredge 2001).
 
The benefits of emergent treatment and termination of SE likely result from minimizing the
 
consequences of impaired ventilation, pulmonary aspiration, hemodynamic instability, or
 
metabolic derangements associated with prolonged convulsions. Rapid termination of seizures
 
may also prevent kindling effects demonstrated in animal models in which seizures become
 
more refractory to subsequent treatment as the duration of seizure increases (Morimoto 2004).
 
Rapid treatment may also prevent the neuronal cell injury and loss that occurs with increasing
 
duration of seizures due to duration dependent cytokine mediated effects (Ravizza 2005).
 
Since status epilepticus is precipitated by a variety of acute and unpredictable etiologies, there
 
is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for
 
participation in the research. Furthermore, status epilepticus is often an initial presenting
 
manifestation of disease, precluding prospective identification. This was confirmed in data from
 
Baren et al that found prospective identification of subjects for the PECARN Pediatric Seizure
 
Study to be infeasible (Baren 2006).
 
Participation holds prospect of direct benefit to subjects
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the
 
subjects because: (i) subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;
 
(ii) appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information
 
derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to
 
provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and (iii) risks associated with the investigation
 
are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of
 
subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and
 
benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.
 
Participation in ESETT holds out the prospect of direct benefit to subjects. Subjects may directly
 
benefit from participation because status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition and some of
 
the interventions used in this study may be more effective than others.   Studies in
 
experimental SE in animals suggest that LEV may terminate established SE but that FOS, the
 
 
 
34
  
treatment most commonly used, fails to do so (Mazarati 1998; McDonough 2004; Prasad 2002).
 
Some observational clinical data also suggests that FOS or its active metabolite PHT are not the
 
most effective second-line agents (Agarwal 2007, Alvarez 2011).  The use of response adaptive
 
randomization in this trial increases the probability that those enrolled later in the trial will be
 
more likely to be randomized to the more effective arm if there is a more effective arm.
 
The trial can not be practicably carried out without exception from informed consent
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the
 
waiver.
 
This research could not be carried out without EFIC because treatment for SE needs to begin
 
immediately upon ED arrival.  Since SE patients are unable to consent for themselves and there
 
is not time to obtain consent from an LAR, all patients must be enrolled under EFIC.  A
 
meaningful informed consent process requires that the LAR have time to understand the
 
material presented, be able to ask questions and have time to think about what the patient
 
would want.  This is not possible in the brief period in which the study drug is obtained and
 
initiated.  In ESE, time to treatment is especially critical.  Inability to obtain informed consent
 
can limit the ability to discover better treatments for this critical and life-threatening condition.
 
 
Need for immediate treatment of status epilepticus precludes consent from an LAR
 
21 CFR 50.24 (a)(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential
 
therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to
 
attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of
 
time and, if feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative contacted for consent within
 
that window rather than proceeding without consent. The investigator will summarize efforts
 
made to contact legally authorized representatives and make this information available to the IRB
 
at the time of continuing review.
 
The narrow therapeutic window described above, the inability of patients with SE to
 
communicate, and the inherent delay in delivery of standard therapy in attempts to contact
 
and discuss consent with a surrogate decision maker preclude the possibility of obtaining
 
informed consent for any potential subject in ESETT.  Attempts to contact LAR for notification
 
and consent to continue participation will be tracked and can be summarized and reported to
 
the IRB at the initial and continuing reviews.
 
Provision of an informed consent document
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an
 
informed consent document consistent with Sec. 50.25. These procedures and the informed
 
consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in
 
situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and
 
approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family
 
member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with
 
paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section.
 
 
 
35
  
A written informed consent document prepared at each site for this study must be reviewed
 
and approved by participating IRB’s approving this clinical investigation. Subjects enrolled in
 
ESETT, or their legally authorized representatives (LAR) or family, are informed of the subject’s
 
inclusion in the clinical investigation at the earliest possible opportunity. The study team is
 
immediately notified of the arrival of treated subjects in the emergency department (ED). An on
 
call study team member quickly responds to the ED to complete the subject enrollment. The
 
subject (or LAR or family) is approached, and an informed consent process initiated as soon as
 
possible. The study team notifies the subject or LAR/family about the subject’s enrollment,
 
provides information about the study and about the subject’s rights and the responsibilities of
 
the investigators, and answers any questions about the study and further participation. A
 
written informed consent document is used to reinforce the information provided verbally and
 
to document a decision to either continue in the study or to not participate any further. A copy
 
of this form is provided to the subject and another copy is placed in the research record.
 
 
Community Consultation
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: (i) consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by the
 
IRB) with representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted
 
and from which the subjects will be drawn
 
The community will be consulted prior to the initiation of research.  With guidance from the
 
each site’s IRB, the community will be asked to give their opinions of the research.  A menu of
 
options is included in the detailed EFIC plan in the MoP and includes mechanisms such as
 
community meetings, town hall meetings, focus groups, meetings with established community
 
advisory boards, in-person surveys, and random-digit dialing surveys.  The specific type of
 
community consultation will be determined by each site’s IRB.  Reporting of community
 
consultation results will be standardized across the ESETT sites.
 
Public Disclosure
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: 
…
.(ii) Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation
 
will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical
 
investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits; (iii) Public
 
disclosure of sufficient information following completion of the clinical investigation to apprise
 
the community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the
 
research population, and its results
 
Public disclosure is the primary element in making certain that ESETT is conducted in an entirely
 
transparent manner. Methods of announcing information about the trial, and the development
 
of advertising and other materials about the trial, will take place both locally and nationally.
 
Public disclosure will be initiated prior to approval of the trial, may continue during enrollment,
 
and will conclude with dissemination of study results after the trial is completed. A menu and
 
 
 
36
  
discussion of many public disclosure methods and procedures is detailed in the EFIC plan in the
 
MoP.  Each site IRB will determine the type and form of local public disclosure.  Reporting of
 
public disclosure efforts will be standardized. Summaries of public disclosure will be reported to
 
each IRB, and composite reports of local and national public disclosure at the trial-level will be
 
provided to the FDA docket.
 
Data Monitoring Committee
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: 
…
.(iv) Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise
 
oversight of the clinical investigation;
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is appointed by the NINDS to provide ongoing
 
evaluation of safety data as well as the overall conduct of the trial, per institute guidelines. The
 
members will have a meeting with the study team prior to study commencement to discuss the
 
protocol as well as content and format of the DSMB reports. The SDMC will prepare requested
 
reports at specified time intervals. Data and safety monitoring will be performed consistent
 
with the guidance provided by the NIH notices 98-084 “Policy for data and safety monitoring”
 
and OD-00-038 “Further guidance on data and safety monitoring for phase I and phase II trials”,
 
and by the NINDS document based on these notices “NINDS Guidelines for Data and Safety
 
Monitoring in Clinical Trials”.
 
Contacting Other Family
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: 
…
. (v) If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized
 
representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to
 
attempting to contact within the therapeutic window the subject's family member who is not a
 
legally authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's
 
participation in the clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact
 
family members and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review.
 
It will not be ethically possible in ESETT, for the reasons described above, to delay treatment of
 
the seizing subject long enough to contact either an LAR or other family members. A provision
 
of the protocol has been made to allow subjects that learn of the trial through public disclosure
 
efforts or other means, and who would not want to participate if treated in the ED for status
 
epilepticus, to communicate that decision to the ED without causing any delay in treatment. As
 
part of the primary assessment of a seizing patient, ED providers already check for medical alert
 
jewelry to ascertain emergent medical information about the patient. If the words “ESETT
 
declined,” or alternative designation as defined in the MoP, are listed on the medical alert tag,
 
the patient will not be enrolled in the clinical investigation. Medical alert tags are commonly
 
used by people with epilepsy already, and provide a means of communication that does not
 
require such patients to wear any extra marker. Since they are already worn daily, they do not
 
require additional effort to use once information is added to the tag. The tags are common and
 
 
 
37
  
effective for communicating information to medics while still being inconspicuous. Use of this
 
enrollment exclusion will be tracked and this information made available to IRBs at the time of
 
continuing review.
 
Post Enrollment Notification and Consent to Continue
 
21 CFR 50.24(b) The IRB is responsible for ensuring that procedures are in place to inform, at the
 
earliest feasible opportunity, each subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally
 
authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a
 
family member, of the subject's inclusion in the clinical investigation, the details of the
 
investigation and other information contained in the informed consent document. The IRB shall
 
also ensure that there is a procedure to inform the subject, or if the subject remains
 
incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not
 
reasonably available, a family member, that he or she may discontinue the subject's participation
 
at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. If a
 
legally authorized representative or family member is told about the clinical investigation and the
 
subject's condition improves, the subject is also to be informed as soon as feasible. If a subject is
 
entered into a clinical investigation with waived consent and the subject dies before a legally
 
authorized representative or family member can be contacted, information about the clinical
 
investigation is to be provided to the subject's legally authorized representative or family
 
member, if feasible.
 
Subjects enrolled in ESETT, or their legally authorized representatives (LAR) or family, are
 
informed of the subject’s inclusion in the clinical investigation at the earliest possible
 
opportunity as detailed above and in the MoP. It is anticipated that the notification of subjects,
 
or their families or LAR, will most commonly take place in the ED within hours of subject
 
enrollment. Attempts to notify the subject or an LAR are repeated until successful. All
 
notification attempts are logged and recorded in the subjects online case report form in
 
WebDCU
™
. Reports of these logs will be available for inclusion in annual reports to the
 
respective IRBs.
 
Record Keeping
 
21 CFR 50.24(c) Like other IRB records, records of the determinations above must be kept for a
 
minimum of three years after the completion of the clinical investigation. Again, like other IRB
 
records, these are subject to inspection and copying by FDA.
 
Records documenting the enrollment of patients using EFIC, procedures for notification of
 
enrollment, and informed consent forms will be kept for a minimum of three years after
 
completion of the clinical investigation.
 
IND Requirement
 
21 CFR 50.24(d) Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this
 
section must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or
 
investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may
 
include subjects who are unable to consent. The submission of those protocols in a separate
 
IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device
 
already exists. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as
 
 
 
38
  
amendments under Secs. 312.30 or 812.35 of this chapter.
 
This trial requires an IND, review and approval by the FDA. No enrollment can commence
 
unless approval by the FDA and participating IRBs is obtained. The Study Principal Investigator
 
serves as the sponsor of the IND. Discussions with the FDA have clarified that a single IND is
 
appropriate for the proposed trial.
 
Communication of IRB Determinations
 
21 CFR 50.24(e) If an IRB determines that it cannot approve a clinical investigation because the
 
investigation does not meet the criteria in the exception provided under paragraph (a) of this
 
section or because of other relevant ethical concerns, the IRB must document its findings and
 
provide these findings promptly in writing to the clinical investigator and to the sponsor of the
 
clinical investigation. The sponsor of the clinical investigation must promptly disclose this
 
information to FDA and to the sponsor's clinical investigators who are participating or are asked
 
to participate in this or a substantially equivalent clinical investigation of the sponsor, and to
 
other IRBs that have been, or are, asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation
 
by that sponsor.
 
If an application for ESETT is disapproved by a local IRB at any site, the Hub principal
 
investigator will inform the ESETT principal investigator and IND sponsor and provide him with
 
the written findings of that IRB. The Study PI/sponsor will promptly disclose this information to
 
the FDA, and to all participating Hub PIs who will be instructed to submit these to all IRBs to
 
which applications for ESETT have been submitted for review. If there is a change in the study
 
protocol, then there must be a re-review of the protocol by all the IRBs of the participating
 
institutions.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
39
  
6. STUDY ENROLLMENT PROCEDURE
 
6.1  Screening
 
The goal is to include all eligible patients who present to participating EDs.  All patients
 
presenting with a diagnosis of seizures or convulsions will be evaluated for participation in the
 
study.  A screen failure log will include patients with a diagnosis of seizures or status epilepticus
 
who are not randomized into ESETT.
 
 
6.2  Enrollment
 
Study processes will not delay clinical treatment.  When an eligible patient presents to the
 
emergency department, the clinical team will access the age appropriate ESETT “use next” box.
 
To ensure treatment is not delayed, the “use next” box must be easily accessible and
 
maintained in proximity to patient care in the ED.  Most often, this will be in the secured ED
 
medication dispensing system or the ED pharmacy.
 
 
The clinical team opens the “use next” box.  The protocol assist device is activated.  The weight
 
based infusion rate is determined from the dose administration chart.  If the patient is a child,
 
the length based weight estimation tool is used to determine dose unless an accurate weight is
 
known.  An infusion pump is programmed with the determined rate and the infusion line is
 
primed.  The infusion is then started and the timer is started on the protocol assist device.
 
 
The study team should be alerted at this time, if not already done.
 
Study drug is administered by pump for ten minutes (except as noted in section 7.3).  The
 
infusion is then discontinued and discarded.  The patient should then be observed for 10 more
 
minutes, until 20 minutes after the start of study drug infusion.  Rescue therapy is not indicated
 
during this period.  After 10 minutes from the end of study drug infusion, rescue therapy should
 
be given as deemed clinically indicated by the care team for persistent or recurrent seizures.
 
The primary outcome is determined at 60 minutes.
 
6.3  Study Team Arrival
 
The study team should be activated as early as possible without delaying treatment.  The care
 
team follows the protocol but does not engage in research.  Questions about eligibility are
 
determined by the study team.  The study team will arrive in the ED as soon as possible.
 
 
Upon arrival, the study team will assist the clinical team in completing the protocol.  After
 
arrival the study team will seek an LAR to notify of the subject’s participation and to determine
 
consent to continue.  The study team maintains a log of attempts to locate an LAR, of
 
notifications, and of consent decisions.
 
 
 
40
  
The study team will collect and complete the ED-enrollment case report form, will collect the
 
spent “use next” box and protocol assist device, and will process, reload, and place a new “use
 
next” box.
 
6.4  Blood Draw
 
Up to 2 tubes of blood, approximately 5 mL total (2.5 mL each), may be drawn from a subset of
 
subjects after the study drug infusion to confirm drug levels and accurate assignment as needed
 
to ensure study performance.

7. STUDY INTERVENTIONS
 
7.1  Determination of subject weight
 
The rate of study drug infusion is based on estimated patient weight.  The subject’s weight may
 
be obtained from reliable caregivers or records.  In children, if an accurate weight is not known,
 
dose will be determined using the length-based weight/dose estimation tool included in the
 
“use next” box, (akin to the Broselow tape).  In adults and the elderly, weight will be estimated
 
in the manner as in standard care for weight-based dosing of other resuscitation/critical care
 
drugs.  A measured weight may also be used if available, but it is expected that the clinical
 
scenario will usually preclude weighing the subject.
 
 
7.2  Study drug administration
 
Study drugs will be administered intravenously.  For purposes of this study, intraosseous (IO)
 
access will always be considered equivalent to IV access.  Infusion pumps will be used to ensure
 
that study drug is administered over 10 minutes.
 
 
The infusion pump will be programmed to deliver the volume/rate indicated on the dose
 
administration chart (table 3).  The volume and rate will be confirmed by a second nurse.
 
Infusion will last 10 minutes.  Priming the line prior to infusion and flushing the line at the end
 
of infusion are performed in a manner that ensures the entire study volume of study drug is
 
delivered in accordance with local nursing practice.

7.3  Study Drug Infusion Precautions
 
Study drug infusion precautions are the same as in standard care in patients with status
 
epilepticus.  Heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation are monitored.
 
 
If hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia occur during study drug infusion, the infusion rate will be
 
reduced by 50% (increasing the infusion time and maintaining the planned volume).
 
In this context, hypotension is defined as sustained systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg in
 
subjects 13 years and older, <80 mm Hg for 7 years to <13 years, and <70 mm Hg for 2 years to
 
<7 years.  Intravenous fluid may also be used for initial treatment of hypotension.
 
 
 
43
  
If hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia persist, or as determined appropriate by the care team,
 
the drug infusion will be discontinued.  Persistent hypotension or arrhythmia will be treated
 
according to local standard care after the study drug is stopped.
 
Treatment with study drug may also be terminated for any serious adverse event during
 
infusion that the treating physician believes is study drug related.
 
Discontinuation of study drug does not affect participation of the subject in the study.  All
 
subjects should be followed until they reach their end of study.
 
7.4  Randomization
 
Due to the emergency nature of ESE, randomization must not delay treatment.   To complete
 
the randomization quickly, the study drug will be preassigned using a central randomization
 
process via WebDCU.  The mortality associated with SE and etiology of SE varies with age. In
 
addition, certain adverse effects of drugs such as hypotension are more common in the elderly
 
compared to the pediatric age group. For these reasons, randomization assignments will be
 
stratified by age group (2-18 years, 19-65 years, and greater than 65 years).
 
 
Prior to enrollment at each site, the randomization assignment is made [for each of the three
 
age strata]. The assigned study drug is installed in the “use next” box.  When the next eligible
 
subject at the clinical site is identified, the ED nurse or physician, selects the “use next” box [for
 
that stratum].
 
 
Once the infusion pump, connected to study drug vial and patient’s IV catheter, is turned on,
 
the patient is considered to have been randomized into the study.  After a patient is
 
randomized and the study team member enters the randomization form into WebDCU, the
 
next treatment assignment is made, and a new “use next” box can be prepared.  Hence, after
 
each subject is randomized, the treatment assignment is made for the subsequent subject
 
(within that stratum) once the current subject’s randomization data are entered into WebDCU.
 
Sites may also be contacted and asked to go to WebDCU to reassign the content of the “use
 
next” box when randomization in the trial is updated.
 
 
7.5  Study Drug
 
Study drug will be produced at the central pharmacy, a GMP facility at University of California,
 
Davis.  Diluted formulations are expected to remain stable for months when stored at 4-8 
​
O
​
C.
 
Expiration dates for study drug will be determined and adjusted based upon ongoing stability
 
testing performed on study drugs prepared at the GMP facility for the study.
 
All three formulations will be pale yellow solutions.  None are reported to consistently cause
 
infusion-site adverse effects.  The method of drug administration, including volume and rate of
 
 
 
44
  
infusion is identical for all three drugs.  These factors ensure that drug administration will be
 
blinded.
 
The drugs will be formulated in the following concentrations:  FOS 16.66 mg/ml, VPA 33.33
 
mg/ml and LEV 50 mg/ml.  The dose will be FOS 20 mg/kg, VPA 40 mg/kg, and LEV 60 mg/kg,
 
increasing up to a weight of 75 kg.  At this weight the maximum safe dose for a 10 minute
 
infusion period for adults is reached.  A 10 kg patient would receive drug infusion at the rate of
 
1.2 ml/min and those weighing 75 kg or more will receive drugs at an infusion rate of 9 ml/min.
 
 
7.6  Study Drug Packaging
 
 
Study drug will be prepared in 100 mL glass vials, labeled as investigational, and coded with
 
unique human readable ID numbers and barcodes.  Because this is a blinded study, nobody at
 
the site (local pharmacy, clinical team, and study team) will know whether the next assignment
 
is FOS, VPA, or LEV.
 
 
“Use next” boxes will be prepared at the site and contain:  1) a 100 ml glass vial containing
 
either FOS, VPA, or LEV, 2) a dose administration chart, 3) a protocol assist device, and 4) a
 
length based weight/dose estimation tape (similar to Broselow tape).
 
 
7.7  Protocol Assist Device
 
The protocol assist device is a mobile electronic platform, such as the Apple iPod Touch, with an
 
ESETT app loaded on it.  It is intended to assist the clinical and study team in performing the
 
study protocol.  The app will be started by the treating physician or nurse and will guide the
 
team through the initial phase of the study. The device is intended to serve several functions
 
including: confirmation of correct randomization code, time keeping during infusion and
 
evaluation, supplemental data logging, and support of rapid emergency unblinding.
 
 
The protocol assist device should be kept at subject’s bedside until retrieved by the study team.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
45
  
8.  OUTCOME ASSESSMENT AND POST-INTERVENTION
 
 
8.1  Assessment of treatment effect
 
 
Assessment of treatment effect is performed at 20 minutes and 60 minutes after the start of
 
study drug infusion.
 
 
“Start of study drug infusion” is considered the time of randomization.  It is the time when the
 
study drug infusion is begun by starting the IV infusion pump.
 
Absence of clinically apparent seizure at 20 and 60 minutes is determined clinically.  Clinically
 
apparent seizure is defined as obvious focal or generalized tonic clonic movements, nystagmoid
 
or rhythmic eye movements, or generalized or segmental myoclonus at the time of assessment.
 
 
Patient’s responsiveness to verbal command or noxious stimuli is observed at 20 and 60
 
minutes.  Responsiveness at time of assessment is always compared to that at the time of
 
randomization. Generally, improvements in responsiveness are characterized by purposeful
 
responses to noxious stimuli, the ability to follow commands, or verbalization.  The Richmond
 
Agitation Scale Score will be recorded and may be used to assist in this determination.
 
 
8.2  Determination of primary outcome
 
The primary outcome will be determined 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion.  The
 
primary outcome may be determined by the study team if present, or by a treating ED physician
 
on the clinical team if the study team is not yet available.  The primary outcome is based upon
 
the assessment of treatment effect at 60 minutes as defined above, and the use of additional
 
anti-seizure medications.  Ongoing seizures at the time of determination of the primary
 
outcome, whether persistently or recurringly, indicates a failure to meet the primary outcome.
 
Transient seizure recurrence followed by cessation, however, is consistent with meeting the
 
primary outcome.
 
 
Medications qualifying as “anti-seizure medications” for the purpose of determining the
 
primary outcome are detailed in the study Manual of Procedures.  The administration of the
 
these anticonvulsant or sedative medications for recurrent seizures or any other reason, by any
 
route, within 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion indicates a failure to meet the
 
primary outcome.
 
The primary outcome should be based on the assessment of what the treatment effect and the
 
condition of the patient were at 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion based upon all
 
information available to the assessor at the time the primary outcome is documented.
 
Death prior to 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion indicates a failure to meet the
 
primary outcome.
 
 
 
 
46
  
The primary outcome may be documented in more than one location.  The highest level of
 
source document in the established hierarchy will be considered the primary source document
 
for the primary outcome.  The hierarchy of source documents that will be used to confirm the
 
primary outcome outcome is:
 
1.
Contemporaneous direct data entry.  If the primary outcome is directly entered into the
 
CRF in WebDCU at the bedside, the CRF itself will be considered the primary source
 
document.
 
2.
Study book form worksheet.  If a paper version of the CRF is used as a worksheet, that
 
worksheet will be used to complete the CRF in WebDCU and must be maintained in the
 
study binder and considered the primary source document.
 
 
3.
Protocol Assist Device.  The primary outcome recorded on the protocol assist device will
 
be treated as a source document and may be used as an electronic CRF worksheet from
 
which to complete the CRF.
 
 
4.
Medical Record - study note template.  The clinical medical record may also be the
 
source document.  A templated study note takes precedence among medical records.
 
5.
Medical Record - adjudicated.  If there is no structured source of the primary outcome,
 
the medical record will be the source and the adjudicated primary outcome used.
 
 
8.3  Determination of secondary outcomes
 
The primary safety outcome is the absence of life threatening hypotension and cardiac
 
arrhythmia within 60 minutes of the start of study drug infusion.
 
 
Life-threatening hypotension is defined as systolic blood pressure remaining below the
 
age-specified thresholds on two consecutive readings at least 10 minutes apart and remaining
 
below the age-specified thresholds for more than 10 minutes after reduction of the rate of
 
study drug infusion rate (or its termination) and a fluid challenge.  The “age-specified
 
thresholds” for systolic blood pressure are 90 mmHg in adults and children 13 years and older,
 
80 mmHg in children 7 to 12 years old, and 70 mmHg in children through 6 years of age.
 
Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia is defined as any arrhythmia that persists despite reducing
 
rate of study drug infusion, and that requires termination with chest compressions, pacing,
 
defibrillation, or use of  an antiarrhythmic agent or procedure.
 
Additional predefined safety outcomes include mortality, need for endotracheal intubation
 
within 60 minutes of start of study drug infusion, Richmond agitation and sedation score (RASS)
 
at 60 minutes, acute seizure recurrence within 12 hours, and acute anaphylaxis.
 
Mortality is determined by survival to subject end-of-study (hospital discharge or 30 days,
 
whichever comes first).  All causes of mortality are included.
 
 
 
47
  
Need for endotracheal intubation within 60 minutes of start of study drug infusion includes any
 
placement or attempt at placement of a definitive tracheal airway (orotracheal, nasotracheal,
 
cricothyroidotomy, or tracheostomy) for support of respirations or protection of airway.  The
 
use of non-definitive and/or non-tracheal airways (oral or nasal airways, laryngeal mask
 
airways, or esophageal obturator airways) is not included if the patient is not subsequently
 
intubated unless specifically deemed to have been used in lieu of tracheal intubation.
 
The RASS may be determined by the care team or the study team.  The RASS scoring system is
 
fully described in the manual of procedures.
 
Acute recurrent seizure is defined as definitive convulsive or electroencephalographic seizure
 
activity triggering further anticonvulsant therapy occurring between 60 minutes and 12 hours
 
after the start of study drug infusion. This definition does not include those given further
 
anticonvulsants as secondary prophylaxis or as treatment for vague or uncertain exam findings
 
or nondiagnostic electroencephalography.
 
 
Acute anaphylaxis is defined as a clinical presentation consistent with life threatening allergic
 
reaction occurring within 6 hours of the start of study drug infusions and manifested as
 
urticaria in combination with either (1) a systolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg sustained for
 
greater than 5 minutes, or (2) objective evidence of airway obstruction, and for which the
 
patient was treated with antihistamines and/or steroids.
 
 
Respiratory depression is defined as impairment of ventilation or oxygenation necessitating
 
definitive endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.  It is distinct from intubations
 
performed only for airway protection in those with decreased levels of consciousness.   It does
 
not include those getting only supraglottic airways or transient bag-valve-mask support.
 
Secondary efficacy outcomes include time to termination of seizures, admission to ICU, and the
 
length of ICU and hospital stays.
 
 
The time to termination of seizures is the interval from the start of infusion of study drug to
 
cessation of clinically apparent seizure in those who meet the primary outcome.
 
 
Hospital and ICU admission from the ED, and length of stay, is abstracted from the hospital
 
admission record. ICU admission is recorded as occurring only if the ICU is the initial inpatient
 
unit for the patient.  Length of stay is determined by the number of calendar days after the day
 
of ED arrival until hospital discharge or subject end-of-study.
 
8.4  Endotracheal intubation
 
Elective or semi-elective endotracheal intubation (e.g. for imaging studies, etc.) should be
 
delayed until after determination of primary outcome if possible.  Emergency endotracheal
 
intubation should not be delayed.  The need for emergency intubation is determined by the
 
 
 
48
  
care team.  It is generally not necessary to perform emergency endotracheal intubation for
 
prolonged unresponsiveness alone in this patient population.  Emergent or elective
 
endotracheal intubation and its indication should be carefully documented, including all
 
medications administered.
 
 
8.5  Rescue anticonvulsants
 
Subjects who do not respond to the study drug and continue to seize >20 minutes after the
 
start of study drug infusion (>10 minutes after the completion of study drug infusion) will need
 
additional anticonvulsant therapy for SE at the discretion of the treating team. The treating
 
physician will follow local practice guidelines in choice of a third line agent for the treatment of
 
SE.  Appropriate third line choices include phenobarbital or a general anesthetic such as
 
propofol, midazolam or pentobarbital when a second-line agent has failed.  Finally, some
 
centers may choose to use another second line agent.  If the care team feels that another
 
second line agent is indicated and that knowledge of the study drug given is needed to guide
 
this selection, emergency unblinding should proceed as described below in section 10.2.
 
 
8.6  Continuous EEG
 
Continuous EEG should be performed as indicated by the care team consistent with standard
 
clinical practice.  If indicated, cEEG should be initiated as early as possible.
 
 
8.7  Standard supportive care
 
Other than as indicated in this protocol, subjects will receive the usual care and evaluation
 
provided at each site.  Sites may wish to reference the practice parameter recommendations
 
for status epilepticus of the American Academy of Neurology (Riviello 2006).
 
 
 
 
 
49
  
9. ADVERSE EVENTS
 
9.1 Definitions of Adverse Events:
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical
 
treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or
 
procedure. An AE is a term that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical
 
documentation and scientific analyses.
 
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse event that is fatal or life threatening, is
 
permanently or substantially disabling, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a
 
congenital anomaly, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. For
 
the purposes of this study, we specifically exclude hospitalization for the sole purpose of
 
observing a patient after SE as a Serious Adverse Event.
 
9.2 Grading of Adverse Events
 
All adverse events (AEs) occurring within 24 hours of treatment and all serious adverse events
 
occurring during study participation will be documented on the AE case report form. The
 
severity of adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
 
Adverse Events (Version 4.03, June 2010, CTCAE). The CTCAE provides a grading (severity) scale
 
for each AE term and AEs are listed alphabetically within categories based on anatomy or
 
pathophysiology. The CTCAE (v 4.03) displays Grades 1-5 with unique clinical descriptions of
 
severity for each AE based on this general guidance:
 
Table 4.
 
 
Grades
 
Descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline
 
Grade 1 Mild
 
Asymptomatic or mild  symptoms; clinical or diagnostic
 
observations only; intervention not indicated
 
Grade 2 Moderate
 
minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate
 
instrumental activities of daily living.
 
 
Grade 3 Severe
 
medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or
 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL
 
Grade 4
 
Life-threatening
 
 
urgent intervention indicated
 
Grade 5 Fatal
 
Death related to AE
 
 
Severity is not equivalent to seriousness. A serious adverse event (SAE) would be any event in
 
 
 
50
  
category 4 or 5, and any event in category 3 that required or prolonged hospitalization. Not all
 
grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than five options
 
for Grade Selection i.e., Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an
 
option.
 
 
9.3  Relationship to Study Treatment
 
 
One of the most important components of AE reporting is determining the cause of the AE. It is
 
imperative that the investigator assess AE causality in terms of overall study participation and
 
make an independent determination as to whether the AE was thought to be related to any
 
study-related activity (i.e., study intervention,). Determination may be particularly challenging
 
in ESETT since typical criteria for assessing causality such as evaluation of the effects of
 
de-challenge and re-challenge are not possible within the scope of this protocol in which study
 
interventions are isolated single exposures of short acting medications. In addition the
 
underlying cause of SE: stroke, infection, inflammation  etc.  cause adverse events. Finally,
 
prolonged seizures of SE cause adverse events.  For each adverse event, the relationship to the
 
study treatment must be recorded as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, not related.  The
 
NETT modified “Algorithm to Determine Relationship of Adverse Event to Study Agent” will be
 
used for all relatedness determinations in ESETT, and is found in the Manual of Procedures.
 
9.4  Adverse Event Reporting
 
All AEs occurring within 24 hours of study treatment and all serious adverse events (SAEs)
 
occurring until participation in study has ended (discharge from the hospital, death, or 30 days
 
since enrollment)  are recorded on the online AE case report form (CRF) through the
 
WebDCU
™
. The site PI or Study Coordinator or designee is responsible for entering all AEs and
 
SAEs and updating the information (e.g., date of resolution, action taken) in a timely manner.
 
All non-serious AEs must be recorded on the electronic AE CRF within 5 days from the time it
 
was discovered by the site study personnel. For SAEs, the data entry must take place within 24
 
hours of discovery of the event.
 
The site PI is responsible for the monitoring and follow-up of AEs until resolution (or end of
 
study for that subject) and appropriate documentation in the subject research record. In
 
addition to performing protocol-specified follow up, the participating PI must review all
 
previously reported ongoing AEs to evaluate the current status. If an AE that was previously
 
reported on the Adverse Event CRF fully resolves and then recurs at a later date, the second
 
occurrence is considered a new AE and a new Adverse Event CRF must be completed. Likewise,
 
if an SAE that was previously reported and subsequently fully resolved later recurs at a level
 
requiring expedited reporting, the SAE must be reported as a new SAE on the Adverse Event
 
CRF.
 
 
 
51
  
 
9.5 Expected Adverse Events
 
Expected adverse events include side effects known to be potentially associated with the study
 
medications as listed in the study drug package inserts, and complications that commonly occur
 
as a result of the underlying condition or as a result of hospital care.  The outcomes and events
 
defined below are likely and anticipated and will be closely tracked.
 
These include the secondary safety outcomes previously defined in section 8.3:
 
●
Life-threatening hypotension
 
●
Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia
 
●
Mortality
 
●
Need for endotracheal intubation
 
●
RASS
 
●
Acute recurrent seizure
 
 
●
Acute anaphylaxis
 
●
Respiratory depression or failure resulting in intubation.
 
Other defined expected adverse events include:
 
Hepatic transaminase or ammonia elevations, defined as those levels determined by the site
 
investigator to be greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal or otherwise clinically
 
significant.
 
Purple glove syndrome, defined as the presence of all three of the findings of objective edema,
 
discoloration, and pain in the distal extremity in which study drug was administered, with or
 
without known extravasation, and for which there is no other evident etiology.
 
9.6  Clinical Management of Adverse Events
 
All adverse events will be managed according to local institution guidelines and treating
 
physician’s judgment. Specific recommendations for managing acute adverse events during
 
drug infusion are included above in Section 7.3.
 
 
 
 
 
52
  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
10.1 Randomization
 
The randomization scheme will be equal allocation (1:1:1) for the first 300 patients. Once 300
 
subjects are enrolled, response-adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of
 
maximizing the likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm (Connor 2013). The
 
target allocation ratio will be updated every 100 patients. We will use a “Step Forward”
 
centralized randomization procedure developed for emergency treatment trials. (Zhao 2010)
 
Randomization will be stratified by age.
 
10.2 Blinding and unblinding:
 
Patients and emergency department study team members are blinded to the treatment
 
assignment, as are the PIs and clinical coordinating center (CCC). Blinding is provided by the use
 
of the same color of formulations, same drug packaging, and same method of drug
 
administration in every subject.
 
 
Emergency unblinding may be required if the treating team feels that subjects’ care after the
 
study intervention requires knowledge of what study drug was given.  Emergency unblinding
 
will not be performed within 60 minutes of the start of study drug infusion.  The blind should be
 
maintained until after the primary outcome has been collected.
 
 
10.3 Primary outcome:
 
A patient is considered a treatment success if they meet the definition of the primary outcome
 
as defined above.
 
10.4 Secondary outcomes.
 
Secondary outcomes are intended to show safety, congruence or divergence from the primary
 
outcome, or to provide additional detail that helps to more fully describe or interpret the
 
effects of the treatment, the study population, or the clinical scenario.
 
10.5  Primary Analysis
 
The posterior probabilities that each treatment is the most and least effective treatment will be
 
calculated using Bayesian methods. This trial will be considered a success if the probability that
 
a treatment is the most effective is greater than 0.975  or the probability that a treatment is the
 
least effective is greater than 0.975 for any treatment.
 
Each of the three treatment arms is modeled independently.  We assume the probability of
 
response has a uniform Beta(1,1) prior distribution.  We assume the number of responses on
 
each treatment arm follows a binomial distribution.  We update the prior distribution with the
 
observed data and use the resulting posterior distribution to calculate the probability that each
 
 
 
53
  
treatment is the most effective and the probability that each treatment is the least effective.
 
The posterior distribution for each treatment arm will therefore be Beta(1+ # of Successes, 1+ #
 
of Failures).
 
At the conclusion of the trial, we will report the response rates for each treatment group with
 
95% credible intervals and the pairwise differences in responses rates and corresponding 95%
 
credible intervals of those differences.
 
10.6  Frequentist Analysis of the Primary Outcome
 
At the final analysis, the global null hypothesis that the probabilities of success for all three
 
treatment groups are equal will be tested in a chi-squared test with 2 degrees of freedom. If,
 
and only if, the three-way, global null hypothesis is rejected, then all pairwise comparisons will
 
be performed as a two-sample test of difference in proportions (Z - test). Although the
 
Frequentist tests will only occur once, we will use Pocock boundaries to control the overall
 
alpha.
 
10.7  Interim Analyses
 
Interim monitoring for success and futility will begin after 400 subjects have been randomized
 
and will be repeated after every additional 100 subjects are randomized. This trial will stop
 
early for success if we have identified the maximum effective treatment with a least 97.5%
 
probability.
 
There are two early futility criteria.  The first futility rule will stop the trial early if all treatment
 
arms have a clinically unacceptable response rate.  The second futility rule will stop the trial
 
early if all treatments are performing similarly and we will be unable to identify a most effective
 
or least effective treatment.
 
Following review of both the interim analysis results and safety data, the DSMB will make a
 
recommendation regarding the above stopping rules.
 
 
10.8  Estimated accrual
 
Estimates of accrual for purposes of statistical planning assume 40 enrollment sites averaging 5
 
subjects per year over a 4 year enrollment period.
 
 
10.9  Sample size considerations
 
This study will enroll a maximum total sample size of approximately 795 patients over 4 years,
 
at an accrual rate of approximately 16.5 patients per month. A sample size of 795 provides
 
approximately 90% power to identify the most effective treatment when one treatment arm
 
has a true response rate of 65% and the true response rate is 50% in the other two arms (an
 
absolute difference of 15%). The trial operating characteristics were determined via an
 
 
 
54
  
extensive simulation study. The statistical and full simulation details as well as the operating
 
characteristics of the design have been published (Connor 2013).
 
The expected response rates for FOS, LEV and VPA are based on the retrospective analysis of
 
279 episodes of established SE in adults, who were treated with PHT, LEV or VPA (Alvarez
 
2011).  The study reported 59.6% of patient episodes responded to PHT, 51.7% to LEV and
 
74.6% to VPA. Based on this study and expert evaluation of all currently published data on the
 
treatment of established SE, we expect that the worst drug will be effective in 50% of the
 
patients. A 15% difference is the minimum clinically important difference sufficient to change
 
clinical practice.
 
The total sample size for this trial corresponds to the sample size that would be needed for a
 
frequentist analysis. A sample size of 209/group (627 total) is needed for a chi-squared
​
 
​
test with
 
2 degrees of freedom of the overall test of equality of the three proportions with 90% power
 
(assuming the smallest proportion is 0.50 and the largest proportion is 0.65 and the average
 
proportion is 0.55, two-sided alpha 0.05). For a two-sample test of proportions (all pairwise
 
comparisons of treatment groups), with equal allocation into each treatment group, when one
 
treatment proportion is 0.50 and the other treatment proportion is 0.65, the sample size
 
needed is 240 per group to detect an absolute treatment difference as small as 0.15 with 90%
 
power (assuming two-sided alpha 0.05 and interim looks). Thus, a total sample size of 240*3
 
groups=720 (uninflated for re-enrollers, missing data). Given the possibility of re-enrollers,
 
protocol violations, and missing data, the maximum sample size was inflated from 720 up to
 
795  by N`=720*R where R=(1/(1-.025)^2)*1.05. The sample size was inflated in two ways. First,
 
for the re-enrollers (expected to be 5%) who will be excluded from the analysis. Secondly, to
 
account for the impact of treatment cross-overs, protocol violations, and missing data on the
 
ITT analysis (expected to occur 2.5% of the time). In order to determine the operating
 
characteristics for this Bayesian adaptive design, simulations were performed assuming a
 
maximum sample size of 720 (the uninflated maximum) and considering different response rate
 
scenarios.
 
10.10  Missing Data and Non-compliance
 
The primary analysis will be analyzed under the intent-to-treat principle (ITT).  The ITT
 
evaluable sample will include all subjects who are randomized. Subjects that are enrolled more
 
than once during the study period will have only their first enrollment included in the primary
 
analysis. It is anticipated that a maximum of 5% of subjects will be re-enrolled. In an ITT
 
analysis, missing data and treatment cross-overs can be problematic. Due to the short term
 
endpoint, minimal missing data is expected for the primary outcome.  However the inability to
 
administer the full dose of the study drug, or other protocol violations may occur and attenuate
 
the treatment effect. It is anticipated that a maximum of 2.5% of data will be missing or involve
 
 
 
55
  
treatment cross-overs. Any missing values will be considered a treatment failure.
 
 
10.11 Secondary Analyses
 
Secondary analyses of primary outcome will include an analysis of the adjudicated primary
 
outcome, a re-enroller analysis, a per protocol analysis, an analysis by age. Exploratory analyses
 
of the primary outcome will assess treatment differences adjusting for etiology, time from
 
seizure onset to randomization, and enrolling site. Clinically important differences in the
 
treatment effect due to sex/gender, racial, or ethnic differences are not expected, but will be
 
explored. Secondary and exploratory  analyses will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons.
 
10.12  Analysis of Secondary Outcomes
 
The secondary outcomes will be compared by treatment group.  All secondary outcomes will be
 
tested at a significance level of two-sided alpha of 0.05. Binary outcomes will be compared by
 
first testing the null hypothesis that the proportion of responses for all three treatment groups
 
are equal in a chi-squared test. If the three-way null hypothesis is rejected, then all pairwise
 
comparisons will be performed as two-sample tests of proportions. Continuous outcomes will
 
be compared in an F-test to test the null hypothesis that all three treatment groups are equal,
 
followed by pairwise t-tests. Kaplan Meier curves and log rank tests will be used to compare
 
time to event outcomes by treatment group.
 
10.13  Pediatric Subgroup Analysis
 
The interaction of age group and treatment group will be tested at each interim analysis. If
 
there is sufficient evidence of an interaction, then the response-adaptive randomization will be
 
stopped and randomization will revert to equal allocation until the end of the trial.
 
Regardless of whether an interaction between age group and treatment is detected, the
 
primary analysis will be redone by age group (children age 2-18, adult 19-65, and Seniors, >65).

11. DATA COLLECTION
 
11.1  Study activity and data collection
 
Follow up data collection: Very limited clinical data will be collected during hospitalization,
 
beyond that available and collected in the ED.  Hospitalized subjects should be reevaluated the
 
day after admission for adverse events.   At the end of hospitalization, subjects should again be
 
evaluated for serious adverse events.  Seizure etiology and hospital/ICU length of stay are also
 
determined at discharge.
 
11.2  Data Collection Schedule
 
Data elements will be detailed in the CRF study book which is available for download under
 
Project Documents on WebDCU

11.3  Quality assurance
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice
 
and all relevant local, national and international regulations.
 
Please refer to the NETT monitoring standard operating procedures (SOP) at
 
http://nett.umich.edu
​
 . In brief summary, Hub investigators will provide quality assurance
 
within their Hub spoke complex  in a process that, in this network, will be called Verification.
 
This is independent of Monitoring, which, in this network, is used to mean only independent
 
external monitoring by the NETT Project Monitor of the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC).
 
Data quality monitoring is performed continuously.  Out of range and logical errors are
 
identified at the time of data entry.
 
 
Site visits will be conducted periodically by the Project Monitor(s).  Details of the content of site
 
visits are found in the monitoring plan in the MoP.  In brief, the primary purpose of the site visit
 
is to confirm that local regulatory documents are being properly maintained, and to compare
 
data reported on case report forms with source documents, including documentation of
 
informed consent and proper reporting of adverse events.
 
 
Some combination of risk based allocation of site and remote source document verification will
 
be used over the course of the trial.
 
11.4  Data management
 
The NETT Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) will provide data management for
 
the ESETT study. The SDMC is housed in the Data Coordination Unit (DCU) at the Medical
 
University of South Carolina (MUSC). Data entry will occur at the enrolling sites using a
 
web-based data entry system, WebDCU
™
.  A central reader form will be entered into WebDCU
 
at the NETT CCC at the University of Michigan.
 
11.5  Clinical adjudication Core
 
 
The clinical adjudication core will determine key clinical characteristics for each patient enrolled
 
including the etiology of status epilepticus and the duration of seizures prior to enrollment.
 
The primary outcome is based on site determination, but the adjudication core will review all
 
primary outcomes for consistency and will determine the reasons for failure of therapy in those
 
patients who do not meet the primary outcome. Packets of de-identified medical records will
 
be available to the adjudicators as needed.  The adjudicators will be blinded to treatment
 
assignment.

12. HUMAN SUBJECTS
 
The protection of human subjects is of primary importance in clinical research and in this
 
clinical trial.  Clinical treatment teams must assess and treat patients with SE rapidly.  This trial
 
has been designed to avoid delays of treatment of even just a few minutes because longer
 
delays may increase morbidity or mortality.  See section 5 of this protocol for an extensive
 
discussion of the use of EFIC and related processes in this trial.
 
12.1  Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review
 
This protocol and the informed consent document (see template) and any subsequent
 
modifications will be reviewed and approved by the IRB for each site responsible for oversight
 
of the study.
 
 
12.2  Data and safety monitoring board (DSMB)
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appointed by the NINDS will provide ongoing
 
evaluation of safety data as well as the overall conduct of the trial.  The DSMB will be formed by
 
the NINDS as per institute guidelines. The SDMC statisticians will generate Data and Safety
 
Monitoring (DSMB) Reports semi-annually or more frequently as needed. This review will aid in
 
identifying any safety issues that may need to be addressed.
 
 
12.3  Subject Confidentiality
 
All data (case report forms, recordings, laboratory specimens, and other records) kept at the
 
site will be  physically and electronically secured to maintain subject confidentiality.  Paper
 
records and computers with subject data will be stored in locked office or cabinet.  Computer
 
records will always be password protected, and encrypted when possible.  The study database
 
is maintained behind a secure firewall, access is password protected and uses SSL encryption
 
for all data entry and access.  Clinical information will not be released without written
 
permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by the sponsor, the CCC, the
 
SDMC. the IRB, the FDA, the NINDS, or the OHRP.
 
 
12.4 Study Modification/Discontinuation
 
The study may be modified or discontinued at any time by the IRB, the NINDS, the sponsor, the
 
OHRP, the FDA, or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research
 
subjects are protected.

13. PUBLICATIONS AND DATA SHARING
 
Publication of the results of this trial will be governed by the policies and procedures developed
 
by the Executive Committee, and all applicable regulations and rules including reporting to
 
clinicaltrials.gov

1. Contemporaneous direct data entry.
 
If the primary outcome is directly
 
entered into the CRF in WebDCU at the
 
bedside, the CRF itself will be
 
considered the primary source
 
document. 2. Study book form
 
worksheet.  If a paper version of the CRF
 
is used as a worksheet, that worksheet
 
will be used to complete the CRF in
 
WebDCU and must be maintained in the
 
study binder and considered the primary
 
source document. 3. Protocol Assist
 
Device.  The primary outcome recorded
 
on the protocol assist device will be
 
treated as a source document and may
 
be used as an electronic CRF worksheet
 
from which to complete the CRF. 4.
 
Medical Record - study note template.
 
The clinical medical record may also be
 
the source document.  A templated
 
study note takes precedence among
 
medical records. 5. Medical Record -
 
adjudicated.  If there is no structured
 
source of the primary outcome, the
 
medical record will be the source and
 
the adjudicated primary outcome used.

1. Contemporaneous observation and
 
documentation.  The primary outcome is
 
observed by the study team at the
 
bedside and directly recorded on the
 
CRF or on the study book worksheet.
 
Direct data entry in WebDCU is
 
preferred but not required.  2. Direct
 
communication with the clinical team.
 
The study obtains the primary outcome
 
data by direct explicit communication
 
with the treating ED attending physician.
 
Communication should occur and be
 
documented as close to the time of
 
assessment as possible. 3.  Protocol
 
Assist Device.  The primary outcome
 
explicitly recorded on the protocol assist
 
device will be treated as a source
 
document and may be used to complete
 
the CRF if contemporaneous recording
 
or direct communication with the study
 
team are not available. 4.  Medical
 
Record - explicit study specific
 
documentation.  If the medical record is
 
used as a source document, the
 
adjudicators will determine the primary
 
outcome from an explicit study specific
 
template note if available in precedence
 
among available documentation. 5.
 
Medical Record - implicit review.  If the
 
medical record is used as a source
 
document, and no explicit study specific
 
template note is available, the
 
adjudicators will determine the primary
 
outcome from their interpretation of
 
provided documentation.

SYNOPSIS
 
Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial (ESETT)
 
A multicenter, randomized, blinded, comparative effectiveness study of fosphenytoin, valproic
 
acid, or levetiracetam in the emergency department treatment of patients with
 
benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus.
 
Objectives:  
​
The 
​
primary 
​
objective is to determine the most effective and/or the least effective
 
treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus (SE) among patients older than 2
 
years.  There are three active treatment arms being compared:  fosphenytoin (FOS),
 
levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA).  The 
​
second 
​
objective is comparison of three drugs
 
with respect to secondary outcomes.  The final objective is to ensure that the trial is
 
informative for treatment of established SE in children by describing the effectiveness, safety,
 
and rate of adverse reactions of these drugs in children.
 
Primary outcome:  
​
The  primary outcome is clinical cessation of status epilepticus, determined
 
by the absence of clinically apparent seizures and improving responsiveness, at 60 minutes
 
after the start of study drug infusion, without the use of additional anti-seizure medication. The
 
following
​
 
​
are 
​
secondary outcomes
​
: occurrence of life threatening hypotension or cardiac
 
arrhythmia, time to termination of seizures, intubation, admission to ICU, seizure recurrence,
 
length of stay in the ICU and hospital, mortality, and Richmond agitation and sedation score at
 
60 minutes, will be compared between treatment groups.
 
 
Methods:
​
 This is a randomized, multicenter,  Bayesian response adaptive comparative
 
effectiveness trial of three active treatments in patients with status epilepticus who have failed
 
treatment with benzodiazepines.  Each subject will be followed until discharge or 30 days from
 
enrollment, whichever comes first. This trial will be monitored for early success and futility.
 
 
Inclusion:
​
 Patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age, witnessed to have a clinically
 
apparent seizure in the ED, 5-30 minutes after already having received at least an adequate
 
dose of benzodiazepines for generalized, tonic-clonic convulsion(s).  Adequate doses of
 
benzodiazepines for this study are defined as:  diazepam 10 mg IV, lorazepam 4 mg IV, or
 
midazolam 10 mg IV or IM for all adults and those children greater than or equal to 32 kg, and
 
diazepam 0.3mg/kg IV, lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV or midazolam 0.3mg/kg IM or 0.2 mg/kg IV for
 
those children less than 32 kg.  These drugs may have been administered in two or more
 
divided doses, including in the out-of-hospital setting.
 
Interventions and Duration:
​
 The required concentrations of the study drugs (FOS 16.66 mg/ml,
 
VPA 33.33 mg/ml and LEV 50 mg/ml) will be produced, packaged and labeled by the  University
 
of California at Davis Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility and shipped to the study sites.
 
The study drugs are identical in appearance, formulation, packaging, and administration
 
 
 
13
  
(including volume and rate of infusion).
​
  
​
The assigned treatment dose (FOS 20 mg/kg, LEV 60
 
mg/kg or VPA 40 mg/kg) will be infused over 10 minutes.  The
​
 
​
study participants will be
 
observed for 20 minutes, while the duration of clinical seizures and response to verbal or
 
painful stimuli is recorded.  At 60 minutes from start of study drug infusion, the primary
 
outcome is determined.
 
Randomization:
​
 Any patient witnessed to have seizures in the emergency department (ED) will
 
be evaluated for enrollment based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Enrollment will occur
 
under exception from informed consent rules (EFIC) due to the emergent and life-threatening
 
nature of SE.  This is an intent-to-treat study so all subjects randomized will be included in the
 
primary analysis.  Time of randomization is the time when the infusion pump, connected to
 
study drug vial and patient’s IV catheter, is switched on. The randomization scheme will be
 
equal allocation (1:1:1) for the first 300 patients. Once 300 subjects are randomized,
 
response-adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of maximizing the
 
likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm.
 
 
Interim  Analyses: 
​
Interim monitoring for success and futility will begin after 400 subjects have
 
been enrolled and will be repeated after every additional 100 subjects are enrolled . This trial
 
will stop early for success if the analysis identifies the maximum effective treatment with at
 
least 97.5% probability.
 
Sample Size: 
​
This study will  randomize a maximum target of 795 subjects over 4 years, at an
 
accrual rate of approximately 16.5 subjects per month.  This sample size provides
 
approximately  90% power to identify the most effective treatment when one treatment arm
 
has a true response rate of 65% and the true response rate is 50% in the other two arms (an
 
absolute difference of 15% ).  A 15% difference is the minimum clinically important difference
 
sufficient to change clinical practice. The trial operating characteristics for this adaptive design
 
were determined via an extensive simulation study, which ensures the type I error probability is
 
less than 0.05 under a variety of scenarios.
​

Participating Sites:
​
 Patients will be recruited by two national emergency research networks:
 
Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT) network and Pediatric Emergency Care
 
Applied Research Network (PECARN).  Each network has successfully participated in SE
 
treatment trials in compliance with EFIC regulations.

2. BACKGROUND
 
2.1 Rationale
 
SE is defined as a prolonged self-sustaining seizure or recurrent seizures without recovery of
 
consciousness between seizures (Lowenstein 1999).  Epidemiological studies carried out in
 
Richmond, VA, found an annual incidence of SE ranging from 41/100,000-61/100,000
 
(DeLorenzo 1996).  Based on these studies, there are approximately 120,000-180,000 episodes
 
of convulsive SE each year in the US.  SE affects individuals of all ages from the very young to
 
the elderly.  It complicates many neurological and systemic illnesses.  The mortality associated
 
with SE is estimated as 17%.  SE also leads to morbidity including cognitive defects and
 
neurological injury.  The morbidity and mortality of SE is determined by the underlying cause of
 
the SE and the length of time in SE (Neligan 2010; Towne 1994). The Febrile status epilepticus
 
study (FEBSTAT) suggests that SE, but not individual seizures, injures the hippocampus (Nordli,
 
2012; Shinnar 2012).  Early termination of SE can limit development of refractory SE,
 
neurological injury and mortality in experimental animals (Fujikawa 2005; Kapur 1997).  SE is
 
particularly common in children (Shinnar . 1997).  Although multiple different etiologies such as
 
infection, tumors, fever, preexisting neurological injury or brain malformation cause SE, the
 
primary goal of treatment is prompt termination of seizures because adverse consequences of
 
SE increase with seizure duration (Chen 2007; Lothman 1990; Meldrum 1973; Meldrum 1986).
 
 
SE is initially treated with benzodiazepines. This selection is based on three double-blind,
 
randomized, controlled clinical trials (Alldredge 2001; Treiman 1998, SIlbergleit 2012).  In the
 
VA Cooperative Study (Treiman 1998), intravenous lorazepam was found to be superior to
 
phenytoin.  In the Pre-hospital Treatment of Status Epilepticus (PHTSE) study (Alldredge 2001),
 
lorazepam and diazepam were found to be superior to placebo.  In these studies, lorazepam
 
was effective in terminating SE in 55-65% of patients. The recently published RAMPART study
 
compared intramuscular midazolam to intravenous lorazepam for the initial treatment of SE
 
(Silbergleit 2012).  It concluded that intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as
 
intravenous lorazepam for patients in convulsive status epilepticus (Silbergleit 2012).
 
Benzodiazepines are also the first treatment of choice in children (Loddenkemper 2011).  The
 
recently published Pediatric Seizure Study found that lorazepam was not superior to diazepam
 
for pediatric SE (Chamberlain 2014).  Unfortunately, approximately 35-45% of patients are
 
refractory to benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine-refractory SE is also called established SE.
 
ESETT is a clinical trial testing the relative efficacy and safety of three treatments in patients
 
who do not respond to benzodiazepine treatment (Cock 2011; Prasad 2005).  The need for such
 
a trial has been emphasized in review articles, guidelines and by experts in the field (Lowenstein
 
2005;Meierkord 2010; Wheless 2008).
 
For the purpose of this trial, “established SE (ESE)” is defined as an episode of generalized
 
convulsive SE in which seizure activity continues despite administration of adequate doses of
 
 
 
16
  
benzodiazepines.  It has long been recognized that SE is a dynamic and rapidly evolving
 
condition which eventually becomes self-sustaining (Lothman 1990; Lothman 1989; Treiman
 
1990; VanLandingham 1991a; VanLandingham 1991b).  Ongoing seizures rapidly modify
 
neuronal activity and synaptic function (Chen 2007; Macdonald 1999).  This rapid neuronal
 
plasticity is manifested in changes in seizure behavior, EEG patterns, sensitivity to drugs, and
 
evolution of neuronal injury and death.  EEGs recorded from patients soon after onset of
 
generalized convulsive SE demonstrate discrete seizures interspersed with normal activity,
 
which evolves to continuous waxing and waning spike–wave discharges (Treiman 1990).
 
Benzodiazepines given soon after the onset of generalized convulsive status epilepticus are
 
effective in terminating seizures in 60-72% of patients.  As time passes,  these drugs become far
 
less effective, terminating seizures in less than 25% of patients (Treiman 1998).
 
Benzodiazepines act on GABA-A receptors and enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission
 
(Goodkin 2009).  In experimental animals, benzodiazepines terminate seizures effectively if
 
they are given soon after the start of seizures--when EEG demonstrates recurrent seizures and
 
behavioral seizures are mild.  Benzodiazepines are less effective in treating longer lasting SE,
 
especially after electrographic seizures have merged and 10 or more minutes have elapsed
 
since first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (Jones 2002; Kapur 1997; Walton 1988; Wang 2009).
 
Studies further reveal that inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by GABA-A receptors is
 
reduced in the hippocampi of animals in ESE (Goodkin 2008; Kapur 1995; Kapur 1997; Naylor
 
2005; Terunuma 2008). Biochemical studies reveal a decrease in the number of functional
 
receptors on the post-synaptic membrane in the hippocampi of animals in established SE
 
(Goodkin 2005; Goodkin 2008; Naylor 2005; Terunuma 2008).  This rapid receptor plasticity is
 
believed to be mediated by prolonged seizures, which activate many second messenger
 
pathways (Brunig 2001; Pal 2001).  In summary, prolonged seizures modify GABA-A receptors
 
and lead to ESE.
 
 
Further treatment should ideally focus on mechanisms other than GABA-A receptors, such as
 
sodium channels, calcium channels, or glutamatergic transmission. Currently, there are several
 
drugs available in the intravenous formulation that can modify these systems.  Lacosamide and
 
FOS modify sodium channels.  LEV modifies glutamatergic synaptic transmission by binding to
 
the synaptic vesicle proteins.  VPA  has multiple actions on several neurotransmitter systems
 
and ion channels.  These mechanisms are described in the respective package inserts.
 
 
 
2.2 Study Drugs
 
The primary goal of treatment of ESE is to terminate seizures rapidly, without causing
 
respiratory or cardiovascular compromise, or coma.  The active form of the drug must enter the
 
brain rapidly, access its target and stop ESE. Three drugs were selected for this study based on
 
 
 
17
  
current recommendations of professional groups, current clinical practice, and safety and
 
efficacy data.
 
Recently, the Status Epilepticus Guideline Writing Committee of the Neurocritical Care Society
 
(NCS) reviewed current evidence and classified it according to American Heart
 
Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines for evidence rating (Brophy 2012).  The
 
Neurocritical Care Society rated common anticonvulsants for the treatment of SE as follows:
 
VPA
​
:  Class IIa, level A—weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy based on
 
data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials.
 
FOS
​
:  Class IIa, level B--weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy based on
 
data derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized trials.
 
LEV
​
:  Class IIb, level C--weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy based on
 
consensus opinion of experts.
 
These three medications are sometimes referred to by certain brand names.  Fosphenytoin may
 
referred to as Cerebyx or, inaccurately, as Dilantin, the brand name of the active metabolite of
 
this pro-drug.  Levetiracetam may be referred to as Keppra.  Valproic acid may be referred to as
 
Depacon or Depakote.
 
The NCS guidelines recommended use of either FOS or VPA for the treatment of established SE
 
(Brophy 2012).
 
To identify current practice, a critical care pharmacy group studied the patterns of
 
anticonvulsant use for benzodiazepine refractory status epilepticus in the neurocritical care
 
units.  This survey analyzed the medical records of 10-20 recent SE patients from the critical
 
care units at 15 academic medical centers.   Among the 150 patients studied, benzodiazepines
 
were the most commonly used first agent (75%) for treatment of SE.  FOS was the most
 
commonly used second anticonvulsant (33%).  LEV was less commonly used (10%) and VPA was
 
rarely used (<2 %) (Cook 2012).  The NCS Status Epilepticus Guideline Writing Committee
 
reported the preferences of 50 identified experts among neurointensivists, neurologists and
 
epileptologists for the treatment of ESE.  Among the respondents for this survey, 80% chose
 
FOS (or phenytoin), 6% chose LEV and 2% chose VPA (Riviello 2006).  In a survey of 21 pediatric
 
ED directors from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied  Research Network (PECARN), FOS was
 
the most commonly used treatment for ESE in pediatric patients followed by LEV,
 
phenobarbital, and VPA.
 
Intravenous formulations are available for FOS, LEV, VPA, lacosamide and  phenobarbital. Of
 
these drugs, phenobarbital causes sedation and respiratory depression, especially in those who
 
have been treated with benzodiazepines. This side effect limits the popularity of phenobarbital
 
 
 
18
  
as a second line agent for SE.  The safety of rapid intravenous administration of lacosamide has
 
been established in adults but not in children (Fountain 2012).  Children constitute a large
 
fraction of patients with SE.  Three hundred thirty-six of approximately 795 of subjects to be
 
randomized into this study will be children.  There are limited data on the efficacy of
 
lacosamide in established SE, especially in children.  For these reasons, lacosamide and
 
phenobarbital were not included in the study.
 
2.3  FOS (fosphenytoin)
 
FOS is the most commonly recommended treatment for ESE in many current treatment
 
guidelines (Brophy 2012; Loddenkemper 2011; Meierkord 2010) and is generally considered the
 
standard of care.  In a survey of critical care neurologists published in 2003, 95% of responders
 
(n= 106) used FOS or phenytoin for the treatment of ESE (Claassen 2003).  Two more recent
 
surveys suggest that it is currently the most commonly used drug for the treatment of ESE in
 
the US (Cook 2012; Riviello 2012). A survey of pediatric ED physicians belonging to the Pediatric
 
Emergency Care Action Research Network (PECARN) reported that the majority of physicians
 
treating children use FOS for the treatment of ESE.
 
Pharmacokinetics, dose and rate of administration:  By convention, FOS is dosed in phenytoin
 
equivalents (PE). In this protocol, all FOS doses given in mg indicate mg PE whether explicitly
 
stated or not.  In order to achieve rapid termination of seizures, drugs need to be administered
 
rapidly.  Drugs are delivered over a 10 minute infusion period in ESETT.  FOS can  be
 
administered at a maximum rate of 150 mg/min in order to avoid hypotension and cardiac
 
arrhythmias (see boxed warning, package insert).  This limits the maximum dose of the drug
 
that can be administered safely over 10 minutes to 1500 mg.  The recommended loading dose
 
of FOS is 18-20 mg/kg.  Therefore, patients weighing less than 75 kg will receive a loading dose
 
20 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  Those weighing 75 kg or more will receive a fixed dose of 1500 mg
 
over 10 minutes.  Because more than 65% of adult men and 45% of adult women weigh more
 
than 75 kg, weight-based dosing will typically apply to children and fixed dosing to adults.  This
 
dosing regimen is consistent with current recommendation for the use of anticonvulsants,
 
where children are dosed on a mg/kg basis while adults are given fixed doses (see package
 
insert phenytoin, LEV, and VPA).  In general, children are given larger doses of anticonvulsants
 
because of differences in the pharmacokinetics.
 
 
 
19
  
Figure 1.  (Fischer 2003)
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of FOS (1200 mg) administered at the rate of 150 mg phenytoin
 
equivalents (PE)/min is illustrated in Figure 1 (Fischer 2003). Most clinically relevant is panel d
 
showing unbound (free) phenytoin plasma concentrations following administration.  These
 
remain in 2.0- 3.0 mg/L range 90 minutes after administration.  The accepted therapeutic range
 
of unbound plasma concentration is 1 to 2 mg/L.  Patients receiving a single dose of FOS (1500
 
mg) are expected to maintain a free phenytoin concentration above 2 mg/L for 90 to 120
 
minutes. It is thus reasonable in the patient who has stopped seizing to wait for 2 hours from
 
start of infusion to start or restart anticonvulsant medication.
 
FOS is a prodrug which must be converted to phenytoin (PHT) to exert its action (Walton 1990).
 
FOS has to undergo dephosphorylation before it can enter the brain. Figure 2 illustrates the
 
rate of accumulation of PHT in rat plasma and brain after single intraperitoneal injection of FOS
 
(called ACC 9653 at the time of publication) or PHT (Walton 1990). Note that peak plasma PHT
 
concentration was achieved 30 minutes after FOS injection. The peak brain PHT level was
 
attained 60 minutes after administration. PHT is effective against partial onset seizures and
 
secondarily generalized seizures, but its efficacy in primary generalized seizures is not
 
established.  It exerts its anticonvulsant action by stabilizing the inactivated state of sodium
 
channels (Macdonald 1994). FOS gets converted into phenytoin and enters the brain. FOS can
 
be administered faster than phenytoin.
 
 
 
 
20
  
       Figure 2.  (Walton 1990)
 
Safety:  According to the package insert, the dose of IV FOS (15 to 20 mg PE/kg) that is used to
 
treat status epilepticus is administered at a maximum rate of 150 mg PE/min to avoid
 
cardiovascular side effects.  Hypotension may occur, especially after IV administration at high
 
doses and high rates of administration.  Severe cardiovascular reactions and fatalities, such as
 
atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation, have been reported
 
following PHT administration, especially in elderly or gravely ill patients. These complications
 
are less frequent with FOS, but careful cardiac monitoring is still needed when administering IV
 
loading doses of FOS. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be
 
necessary. This ESETT protocol calls for these reductions if needed while administering the
 
study drug.
 
 
Rash: Exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous, rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal
 
necrolysis are known to occur with chronic administration of PHT.
 
 
Hepatotoxicity: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic
 
failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These incidents have been associated with a
 
hypersensitivity syndrome characterized by fever, skin eruptions, and lymphadenopathy, and
 
usually occur within the first 2 months of treatment. Other common manifestations include
 
jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia.
 
The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal
 
outcomes.
 
Hemopoietic system:  thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and
 
 
 
21
  
pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression have been reported.
 
Prenatal exposure to phenytoin was not found to have additional significant clinical risk in a
 
recent Cochrane meta-analysis (Bromley 2014).  Theoretical risks are related to prolonged
 
exposures rather than single dose exposures as in this trial.  Theoretical risks include  congenital
 
malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Increased frequencies of major
 
malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), minor anomalies (dysmorphic facial
 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia), growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and mental
 
deficiency have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin
 
alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Patients known to be
 
pregnant will be excluded from this trial anyway as per the secretarial waiver allowing studies
 
with EFIC.
 
Efficacy in animal studies:  Fosphenytoin and PHT are not effective in termination of
 
benzodiazepine refractory SE in animal model ESE.  In an electrical stimulation model where
 
excitatory inputs to the hippocampus were stimulated (perforant path) for 60 minutes, the
 
resulting in-animal model ESE was not terminated by phenytoin ( 50 mg/kg) given intravenously
 
(Mazarati 1998).  In another animal model of ESE based on electrical stimulation of the
 
hippocampus for 90 minutes, phenytoin did not suppress seizures (Prasad 2002).  Finally, in a
 
cholinergic stimulation (nerve agent-induced) animal model ESE, FOS had little or no
 
therapeutic effect either administered alone or in combination with diazepam (McDonough
 
2004).
 
Efficacy in open studies:  In open-label studies for initial treatment of SE, the reported efficacy
 
of PHT in terminating SE ranges from 44-88%  (Trinka 2009).  In the VA Cooperative study
 
(Treiman 1998), PHT was effective in initial treatment of convulsive SE in 42% of patients, but in
 
only 7.7 % patients with subtle SE.  Effectiveness in ESE was not studied.   A systematic,
 
retrospective analysis concluded that phenytoin was effective in 58.6% of patients with SE who
 
did not respond to benzodiazepines (Alvarez 2011).
 
 
2.4  LEV (levetiracetam)
 
Recently published guidelines for  the treatment of ESE in adults and children recommend LEV
 
as an alternative to FOS (Brophy 2012; Loddenkemper 2011; Meierkord 2010).  In surveys of
 
experts and pediatric ED physicians, LEV is the second most commonly used drug for the
 
treatment of ESE in neurological intensive care units (Cook 2012; Riviello 2012).  It is used for
 
the treatment of partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic seizures and seizures
 
associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.  It binds to synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2)  and
 
modulates neurotransmission.  An intravenous formulation of the drug has been available for
 
several years and it is labelled for use when patients cannot swallow or for initiating therapy for
 
 
 
22
  
seizure.
 
 
Pharmacokinetics & safety:  Doheny et al investigated the plasma and brain concentrations of
 
LEV after bolus intraperitoneal injection of 20, 40 or 80 mg/kg of the drug to rats. Serum LEV
 
concentration increases and peaks rapidly,  but brain accumulation is slow and peaks 90-100
 
minutes after administration (Doheny 1999).
 
 
Dose and rate of administration:  The recommended LEV dose in children up to 40 kg is 20-60
 
mg/kg per day (package insert).  In adults, the recommended dose range is 1-3 g per day, but
 
higher doses up to 6 g per day are commonly used.  The safety of rapid intravenous
 
administration of LEV has been assessed.  Intravenous doses of 2500 mg have been
 
administered over 5 minutes and doses of 4000 mg have been given over 15 minutes safely in
 
adults (Ramael 2006a).  The common adverse effects in these patients were dizziness,
 
somnolence, irritability and headache (Ramael 2006a). Based on these considerations, subjects
 
weighing up to 75 kg will receive a loading dose 60 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  Those weighing 75
 
kg or more will receive a fixed dose of 4500 mg over 10 minutes.
 
  Figure 3.  (Ramael 2006b)
 
Figure 3 demonstrates the pharmacokinetics of LEV following injection of 2000, 3000 or 4000
 
mg of the drug (Ramael 2006b).  It is noteworthy that within 15 minutes of injection the plasma
 
concentration of LEV peaks and remains above 40 µg /ml for 9 hours. The therapeutic
 
concentration of LEV is considered to be 12 to 46 µg /ml.  Therefore, patients treated with LEV
 
are likely to have therapeutic concentrations of the drug for 8 to 10 hours after the start of
 
infusion.
 
Safety: Suicidal ideation: Chronic administration of LEV increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or
 
behavior. Patients treated with LEV for should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of
 
depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.
 
 
 
23
  
Risk of suicidal ideation associated with a single dose of LEV is unknown.
 
 
CNS:  CNS effects include somnolence and fatigue, coordination difficulties, and behavioral
 
abnormalities observed in pediatric and adult population.
 
Hematopoietic:  Minor, but statistically significant, decreases in total mean RBC count (0.03 x
 
106/mm3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in
 
LEV-treated adult and pediatric patients in placebo-controlled trials.
 
Pregnancy Risks:  The best available evidence is that there are no risks related to pregnancy
 
from the administration of levetiracetam in humans.  Current data suggests that the overall risk
 
of major malformation after first trimester exposure to levetiracetam is within the population
 
baseline risk of 1-3%, with no apparent adverse effects on long term child development. The
 
effect of a single dose of LEV has not been studied, but would be of lower risk than repeated
 
dosing (Chaudhry SA, 2014, Bromley 2014).
 
 
Efficacy in animal model ESE:  LEV administered alone reduced the duration of  perforant path
 
stimulation–induced animal ESE (Mazarati 2004).  When used in combination with diazepam,
 
low doses of LEV rapidly terminated behavioral and EEG seizures (Mazarati 2004).  In the
 
cholinergic stimulation animal model of ESE, LEV administered alone suppressed behavioral
 
seizures, but EEG seizures continued unabated (Zheng 2010).
 
Efficacy in open studies:  Although no randomized controlled clinical trial for this agent has
 
been performed, a large number of open case series and reports have been published.  An
 
analysis of publications until 2009 reported that 707 patients with various forms of SE had been
 
treated with LEV.  The success rate was about 70% (Trinka 2011).  In ESE, the efficacy of LEV is
 
reported as 51.7 % in one study (Alvarez 2011) and 73.2% in another study (Tripathi 2010).
 
 
2.5  VPA (valproic acid)
 
VPA was recommended for the treatment of ESE in recent guidelines (Brophy 2012; Meierkord
 
2010). In surveys, VPA is the third or 4
​
th
​
 most commonly used dr ug for the treatment of ESE in
 
the U.S. (Cook 2012; Riviello 2012).  VPA is an anticonvulsant commonly used for the treatment
 
of primary generalized seizures, myoclonic seizures and focal seizures. The drug has multiple
 
actions on the GABA neurotransmitter system and calcium channels (Macdonald 1995).
 
Valproate sodium is the salt of the valproate ion which is synonymous with VPA.

  Figure 4.  (Limdi 2007)
 
Pharmacokinetics:  Subjects weighing up to 75 kg will receive a loading dose of 40 mg/kg over
 
10 minutes.  Those weighing 75 kg or more will receive a fixed dose of 3000 mg over 10
 
minutes. Based on published pharmacokinetic data (Limdi 2007), serum VPA levels will peak
 
between 150-200 mg/L within minutes of administration and then remain in the 50-150 mg/L
 
range for the next 4 hours (see Figure 4).  Pharmacokinetics of IV VPA has been studied in
 
children with epilepsy (Birnbaum 2003; Panomvana Na 2006; Ramsay 2003; Visudtibhan 2011;
 
Williams 2012).  Recent studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of rapid intravenously
 
administered  VPA conforms to models developed using oral VPA in children and oral and
 
intravenous VPA in adults (Williams 2012).  Intravenous VPA is safe in acutely ill children with
 
recurrent seizures and in those with epilepsy (Birnbaum 2003; Ramsay 2003).
 
Dose and rate of administration: Recommended VPA dose ranges from 15-45 mg/kg/day.  VPA
 
has been administered rapidly by the intravenous route.  In one study it was administered at
 
the rate of up to 10 mg/kg/minute for doses up to 30 mg/kg (Limdi 2005).  In another study in
 
children it was given at rates up to 11 mg/kg/min for dose up to 40 mg/kg (Venkataraman 1999;
 
Wheless 2004). The most common adverse events were injection site pain, pain with infusion,
 
dizziness, and somnolence. Based on these considerations, subjects weighing up to 75 kg will
 
receive a loading dose of 40 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  Those weighing 75 kg or more will receive
 
a fixed dose of 3000 mg over 10 minutes.
 
Safety in pregnant women  Children born to mothers taking long durations of high doses of VPA
 
during pregnancy may have a higher than expected  incidence of reduced  cognitive
 
performance at ages 3 and 4.5 (McVearry 2009; Meador 2009; Werler 2011).  These risks  are
 
dose dependent and vary across studies.  They have only been found to be are associated with
 
chronic administration of VPA (Bromley 2014).  There is no evidence that a single dose of VPA
 
 
 
25
  
given during pregnancy can cause birth defects.
 
In a series of reviews of hepatotoxicity associated with VPA, Dreifuss and colleagues concluded
 
that the
​
 
​
 primary risk of fatal hepatic dysfunction (1/500) was fou nd in children 0 to 2 years old
 
receiving VPA as polytherapy. The risk declined with age and was low in patients receiving VPA
 
as monotherapy (1/37,000). No hepatic fatalities occurred in patients above the age of 10 years
 
receiving VPA as monotherapy (Bryant 1996; Dreifuss 1987; Dreifuss 1989).  There are reports
 
that polymerase c gene (POLG) determines the risk of VPA -induced hepatotoxicity (Stewart
 
2010).   However, the POLG polymorphisms were discovered in patients who had been
 
chronically treated with VPA and had elevated hepatic enzymes.  The authors concluded that
 
the genetic variants reduced the regenerative capacity of the hepatocytes following injury.
 
Patients with mutations in POLG have metabolic encephalopathy. There is no report of
 
hepatotoxicity associated with a single dose of VPA.  Patients below age 2, and those with
 
known or suspected metabolic encephalopathy are excluded from  ESETT.
 
 
Exclusion of patients known to be pregnant, younger than 2 years and with known or suspected
 
metabolic encephalopathy will reduce the possibility of VPA exposure to the population at risk
 
for toxicity.  There is a small risk that a pregnant patient who is not identified as pregnant by
 
history or physical examination will be included in the study.  The risk of toxicity is mitigated by
 
the fact that a single dose of VPA will be used.  This risk should be weighed against the known
 
morbidity and mortality of ESE and compared to the risk of administering FOS.
 
Clinical studies:  VPA has been used for the treatment of SE in prospective or retrospective
 
series and two randomized open trials (Trinka 2009). An analysis of these trials reported that
 
693 adults or children in SE have been treated with VPA and the response rate ranging from 60-
 
83% of patients.  A pilot prospective randomized open study reported a trend towards
 
superiority of VPA to phenytoin in treatment of SE (Misra 2006).  Another study reported that
 
VPA controlled SE refractory to PHT (Agarwal 2007).
 
2.6  Systematic comparison of FOS, VPA, and LEV for the treatment of ESE
 
There is one systematic study of treatment of ESE (Alvarez 2011).  In a retrospective analysis of
 
protocol-driven treatment of ESE,  279 adult episodes of SE were identified prospectively in
 
which either PHT or VPA or LEV was given in a non-randomized un-blinded fashion after
 
benzodiazepines failed (labeled Alvarez in figure 5 below). VPA failed to control SE in 25.4%,
 
PHT in 41.4% and LEV in 48.3% of episodes.  Because patients were not balanced with regards
 
to etiology and severity of SE, a post-hoc adjustment for severity and etiology was performed.
 
After this adjustment the authors reported that LEV failed more often than VPA (Odds ratio
 
(OR) 2.69: 95% confidence interval 1.16-6.08)).  PHT was not significantly different from the
 
other two compounds. The authors concluded that LEV is less effective than VPA for control of
 
 
 
26
  
ESE and called for a prospective randomized trial of these agents.
 
 
Two ESE treatment studies were open-label, randomized, prospective studies.  In the first study
 
(labeled Agarwal on figure 5), one hundred patients aged two or older who had failed IV
 
diazepam were randomized to either 20 mg/kg of VPA or 20 mg/kg of PHT.  SE was controlled in
 
44 (88%) patients treated with VPA and 42 (81%) patients treated with PHT (Agarwal 2007).  No
 
significant difference was found between VPA and PHT in this open-labeled study.  In the
 
second study (Tripathi 2010)  patients were randomized  to IV LEV or IV VPA after failing
 
diazepam treatment of SE.  Status epilepticus was terminated by IV LEV in 30 patients and by IV
 
VPA in 28 patients.  In this study as well, there was no significant difference between LEV and
 
VPA.  In summary, one large head-to-head comparison of these three agents raised the
 
possibility that VPA is superior to LEV for the treatment of ESE.  The other studies were
 
inconclusive.  Expert evaluation of the published data suggests that VPA (Class IIa level A) may
 
be superior to  FOS (Class IIa level B), which may be superior to LEV (class IIb level C).
 
 
 
Figure 5.  (Agarwal 2007, Alvarez 2011, Tripathi 2010)
 
In summary, current practice is to treat ESE with FOS or LEV.  However no randomized
 
controlled trials have demonstrated their efficacy in terminating ESE.  Non-randomized and
 
pilot studies suggest VPA may be more efficacious than LEV.  Most expert ED physicians,
 
neurologists, neuro-intensivists and pediatric neurologists believe that the next logical step is a
 
randomized, blinded comparative efficacy study to decide the best treatment for ESE (Brophy
 
2012; Cock 2011; Loddenkemper 2011; Shorvon 2011; Trinka 2009).

3. STUDY DESIGN
 
This is a multicenter, randomized, Bayesian response-adaptive comparative effectiveness trial
 
of three active treatments in patients with established SE who have failed treatment with
 
benzodiazepines. Subjects will initially be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Once 300 subjects are
 
randomized, response-adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of
 
maximizing the likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm.  Interim analyses are
 
planned after 400, 500, 600, and 700 subjects are enrolled.  At each interim analysis, there may
 
be updates to the randomization probabilities. At each interim analysis, the trial may stop early
 
for success or futility. The maximum approximate sample size is 795 subjects total.

4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF SUBJECTS
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria
 
Patients will be included in this study if they are aged 2 or older, have been treated for
 
generalized convulsive seizure of greater than 5 minutes duration with adequate doses of
 
benzodiazepines, and who continue to have persistent or recurrent convulsions in the
 
emergency department at least 5 minutes and no more than 30 minutes after the last dose of
 
benzodiazepine.  The inclusion criteria is intended to describe the population of patients for
 
whom progression to second line anticonvulsants are indicated.  The seizure and its initial
 
treatment may have occurred prior to arrival in the ED.
 
Adequate doses of benzodiazepines for this study are determined to be: diazepam 10 mg IV,
 
lorazepam 4 mg IV or midazolam 10 mg IV or IM for all adults and those children greater than
 
or equal to 32 kg.  For children less than 32 kg adequate doses are: diazepam 0.3 mg/kg IV,
 
lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV and midazolam 0.3mg/kg IM or 0.2 mg/kg IV.  These drugs may have
 
been administered in two or more divided doses.  The last dose of benzodiazepine must be
 
given at least 5 minutes prior study drug initiation to provide this dose sufficient time to act.
 
The last dose of benzodiazepine must be given within 30 minutes of study drug initiation to
 
avoid enrolling patients in whom re-dosing of benzodiazepines may be more appropriate.
 
Transmucosal benzodiazepines such as rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam given at home
 
prior to EMS arrival may be included in the calculation of the cumulative adequate
 
benzodiazepine dose, but at least one dose of benzodiazepines must be also given by EMS or in
 
the ED between 5 and 30 minutes of study drug administration. There is no maximum dose of
 
benzodiazepines  imposed by this trial.  Although these doses are considered the minimum
 
adequate doses based on common clinical practice, it is recommended that the best practice
 
(subject to local standards of care) is to administer 20 mg of diazepam, 8 mg of lorazepam, or
 
20 mg of midazolam in adults prior to progression to enrollment.

5. Informed Consent and Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC)
 
Respect for human subjects and their safety are paramount in this trial.  Research involving
 
subjects who have SE, however, presents an ethical challenge.  Protecting patient autonomy
 
through the informed consent process is typically an ethical cornerstone of human subjects
 
research, but because patients in generalized SE are unconscious, an informed consent process
 
is not possible and patients cannot say whether or not they would want to participate in the
 
research.  Furthermore the alternative process of identifying and obtaining surrogate informed
 
consent from a legally authorized representative (LAR) is not practicable in SE, because the
 
emergency treatment being studied must be initiated as quickly as possible to safely care for
 
the patient.  Identification of the optimal emergency care for those in SE in this trial can
 
therefore only be conducted with exception from informed consent (EFIC) for emergency
 
research.  This section will explain the processes used in this trial and the detailed rationale for
 
compliance with the FDA regulations for EFIC found at 21 CFR 50.24.
 
5.1  Enrollments all performed under EFIC
 
All participants will be enrolled under EFIC.  In this trial there will be no circumstance in which
 
an informed consent process can be meaningfully or safely performed.  All patients eligible for
 
this trial must be unconscious from generalized SE, so no one can consent for themselves, and
 
the rapidity with which treatment is needed for SE precludes obtaining consent from parents
 
and other legally authorized representatives (LAR) even if they are present.  Emergency
 
treatment must be given quickly because every minute of delay decreases the likelihood that an
 
anticonvulsant medication will be effective at terminating seizures, and patient morbidity and
 
mortality increase with increasing seizure duration.  Therefore, the delay related to any
 
meaningful and compliant informed consent process is unsafe, impracticable, and would not be
 
ethical.  It is also not practicable to identify and consent patients prior to developing SE as
 
35-50% of patients who have SE are new onset, and even in patients with epilepsy, SE is a
 
relatively uncommon and unpredictable manifestation.  It is not possible to predict who will
 
have SE.
 
 
A more detailed EFIC Plan document for the trial can be found in the Manual of Procedures
 
(MoP).  The investigational new drug application for this trial is identified as using EFIC.
 
Investigators at each site will perform community consultation and public disclosure as
 
discussed below, and these will be reviewed and approved by local institutional review boards
 
prior to starting the trial at the site.
 
 
5.2  Consent to Continue Participation
 
 
Subjects or their LAR will be notified of enrollment as early as possible and consent to continue
 
participation in the study will be sought for all subjects.
 
 
 
 
33
  
Attempts are typically initiated in the ED by the study team to discuss the enrollment with the
 
subject in those subjects who are waking up, or to locate and communicate with an LAR for
 
subjects who are not waking up.   When a subject or LAR are first available to participate in an
 
informed consent process, they will be asked to continue participation in the study.
 
Continuation in the study only involves further review of the subject’s medical record through
 
the shorter of hospital discharge or 30 days.  Those wishing to continue will have the informed
 
consent document explained to them, will have any questions answered, and they will be asked
 
to review and sign the informed consent document.  In those who wish to discontinue
 
participation, no further data will be collected.  Data collected prior to withdrawal will remain
 
in the study database as per FDA requirements and guidance.  Those wishing to discontinue
 
participation will also have the informed consent document explained to them, will have any
 
questions answered and will be asked to review and sign an informed withdrawal from the
 
study, however, subjects are not required to complete this document in order to withdraw.
 
Standard consent procedures will be used. A copy of a model informed consent document will
 
be provided to sites.
 
If a subject is randomized into ESETT and dies before a legally authorized representative or
 
family member can be contacted, a reliable mailing address for the subject’s family or LAR will
 
be obtained.  After allowing a two to four week period of grieving, the site study team will send
 
a letter with basic information about the clinical investigation, the subject’s inclusion, and
 
contact information so that families can call or write to obtain more information or to get
 
questions answered if desired.
 
5.3  Assessment of Notification and Consent Processes
 
 
Notification and informed consent logs are incorporated in the study case report forms and will
 
allow tracking and reporting of the timeliness of these processes.  In addition, subjects and
 
LAR’s participating in notification and consent processes may be offered an opportunity to
 
share their experience and attitudes by answering a standardized survey up to day following an
 
informed consent or withdrawal.  This information will be used for process improvement and to
 
better understand the subject or LAR perspective on emergency research.
 
5.4  Compliance with Criteria and Processes Required for EFIC
 
FDA regulations identify the specific circumstances in which EFIC is appropriate.  ESETT fulfills
 
these requirements for emergency research.  In the following section, the components of the
 
regulation are reproduced, along with an explanation of how ESETT will comply with each
 
requirement.
 
 
SE is life-threatening and available treatments are unsatisfactory or unproven.
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments
 
 
 
34
  
are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include
 
evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to
 
determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.
 
Population studies of the incidence of SE report an incidence of between 41-61/100,000.  The
 
mortality rate is estimated to be greater than 17% (Neligan 2010).
 
The Cochrane review of anticonvulsant therapy for SE found eleven studies with 2017 subjects.
 
The review concluded that lorazepam was the most effective agent and will terminate SE in
 
only 60-70% of patients with this life-threatening condition.  Because 30-40% of patients do not
 
respond to first-line therapy for SE, benzodiazepines are unsatisfactory on their own.  The three
 
anticonvulsant medications studied in this trial are often used as second-line therapy to treat
 
these patients but are unproven.  There are no randomized, prospective, adequately controlled
 
trials to confirm whether one or more of these medications are either effective or safe in these
 
patients.
 
 
Clinical trials are clearly needed.  No blinded, sufficiently powered prospective, randomized
 
controlled trial has compared treatments for seizures refractory to initial benzodiazepine
 
treatment. Currently published treatment guidelines recommend intravenous FOS as
 
second-line treatment, with LEV and VPA as alternatives (Brophy 2012; Loddenkemper 2011;
 
Meierkord 2010).  However, there are small, open-label randomized studies that suggest the
 
potential efficacy of VPA over LEV in treatment of ESE (Alvarez 2011).  A series of clinical
 
observations suggest that LEV and VPA are safe and effective in the treatment of ESE (Trinka
 
2009; Trinka 2011).
 
Obtaining prospective informed consent is not feasible.
 
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because: (i) the subjects will not be
 
able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition; (ii) the intervention
 
under investigation must be administered before consent from the subjects' legally authorized
 
representatives is feasible; and (iii) There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the
 
individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation.
 
Subjects in generalized status epilepticus are unconscious and unable to provide informed
 
consent due to their medical condition. The care of patients in status epilepticus must be
 
initiated immediately, which, in the Emergency Department care of patients with
 
benzodiazepine refractory SE is the immediate initiation of second line anticonvulsant therapy.
 
 
Complications of prolonged seizures include impaired ventilation and subsequent pulmonary
 
aspiration, cardiac dysrhythmias, derangements of metabolic and autonomic function, and
 
direct injury to the nervous system.  Seizures of short duration may be clinically benign, but
 
longer durations are associated with increasingly severe morbidity and mortality. There is no
 
specific identifiable threshold for seizure duration that predicts the onset of morbidity, and
 
 
 
35
  
thus, clinical practice is geared toward terminating seizures as quickly as possible.
 
 
Clinical data have demonstrated the duration of SE is associated with death and unfavorable
 
neurologic outcomes (Maegaki 2005, Holtkamp 2005). While many of these data concern long
 
durations of SE lasting hours or days, data also suggest that differences of as little as a few
 
minutes in seizure duration are also associated with differences in outcome. Patients found in
 
SE by paramedics who had termination of their seizures prior to arrival to the emergency
 
department have an ICU admission rate of 32% as compared to 73% in patients whose seizures
 
persisted on arrival to the ED. In a randomized trial, patients with SE treated with lorazepam or
 
diazepam in the field by paramedics had mortality at hospital discharge of 7.7% and 4.5%
 
respectively, which was less than half the mortality of 15.7% for patients in whom
 
benzodiazepines were given only after arrival in the ED (Alldredge 2001).
 
The benefits of emergent treatment and termination of SE likely result from minimizing the
 
consequences of impaired ventilation, pulmonary aspiration, hemodynamic instability, or
 
metabolic derangements associated with prolonged convulsions. Rapid termination of seizures
 
may also prevent kindling effects demonstrated in animal models in which seizures become
 
more refractory to subsequent treatment as the duration of seizure increases (Morimoto 2004).
 
Rapid treatment may also prevent the neuronal cell injury and loss that occurs with increasing
 
duration of seizures due to duration dependent cytokine mediated effects (Ravizza 2005).
 
Since status epilepticus is precipitated by a variety of acute and unpredictable etiologies, there
 
is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for
 
participation in the research. Furthermore, status epilepticus is often an initial presenting
 
manifestation of disease, precluding prospective identification. This was confirmed in data from
 
Baren et al that found prospective identification of subjects for the PECARN Pediatric Seizure
 
Study to be infeasible (Baren 2006).
 
Participation holds prospect of direct benefit to subjects
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the
 
subjects because: (i) subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;
 
(ii) appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information
 
derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to
 
provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and (iii) risks associated with the investigation
 
are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of
 
subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and
 
benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.
 
Participation in ESETT holds out the prospect of direct benefit to subjects. Subjects may directly
 
benefit from participation because status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition and some of
 
the interventions used in this study may be more effective than others.   Studies in
 
experimental SE in animals suggest that LEV may terminate established SE but that FOS, the
 
 
 
36
  
treatment most commonly used, fails to do so (Mazarati 1998; McDonough 2004; Prasad 2002).
 
Some observational clinical data also suggests that FOS or its active metabolite PHT are not the
 
most effective second-line agents (Agarwal 2007, Alvarez 2011).  The use of response adaptive
 
randomization in this trial increases the probability that those enrolled later in the trial will be
 
more likely to be randomized to the more effective arm if there is a more effective arm.
 
The trial can not be practicably carried out without exception from informed consent
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the
 
waiver.
 
This research could not be carried out without EFIC because treatment for SE needs to begin
 
immediately upon ED arrival.  Since SE patients are unable to consent for themselves and there
 
is not time to obtain consent from an LAR, all patients must be enrolled under EFIC.  A
 
meaningful informed consent process requires that the LAR have time to understand the
 
material presented, be able to ask questions and have time to think about what the patient
 
would want.  This is not possible in the brief period in which the study drug is obtained and
 
initiated.  In ESE, time to treatment is especially critical.  Inability to obtain informed consent
 
can limit the ability to discover better treatments for this critical and life-threatening condition.
 
 
Need for immediate treatment of status epilepticus precludes consent from an LAR
 
21 CFR 50.24 (a)(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential
 
therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to
 
attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of
 
time and, if feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative contacted for consent within
 
that window rather than proceeding without consent. The investigator will summarize efforts
 
made to contact legally authorized representatives and make this information available to the IRB
 
at the time of continuing review.
 
The narrow therapeutic window described above, the inability of patients with SE to
 
communicate, and the inherent delay in delivery of standard therapy in attempts to contact
 
and discuss consent with a surrogate decision maker preclude the possibility of obtaining
 
informed consent for any potential subject in ESETT.  Attempts to contact LAR for notification
 
and consent to continue participation will be tracked and can be summarized and reported to
 
the IRB at the initial and continuing reviews.
 
Provision of an informed consent document
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an
 
informed consent document consistent with Sec. 50.25. These procedures and the informed
 
consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in
 
situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and
 
approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family
 
member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with
 
paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section.
 
 
 
37
  
A written informed consent document prepared at each site for this study must be reviewed
 
and approved by participating IRB’s approving this clinical investigation. Subjects enrolled in
 
ESETT, or their legally authorized representatives (LAR) or family, are informed of the subject’s
 
inclusion in the clinical investigation at the earliest possible opportunity. The study team is
 
immediately notified of the arrival of treated subjects in the emergency department (ED). An on
 
call study team member quickly responds to the ED to complete the subject enrollment. The
 
subject (or LAR or family) is approached, and an informed consent process initiated as soon as
 
possible. The study team notifies the subject or LAR/family about the subject’s enrollment,
 
provides information about the study and about the subject’s rights and the responsibilities of
 
the investigators, and answers any questions about the study and further participation. A
 
written informed consent document is used to reinforce the information provided verbally and
 
to document a decision to either continue in the study or to not participate any further. A copy
 
of this form is provided to the subject and another copy is placed in the research record.
 
 
Community Consultation
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: (i) consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by the
 
IRB) with representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted
 
and from which the subjects will be drawn
 
The community will be consulted prior to the initiation of research.  With guidance from the
 
each site’s IRB, the community will be asked to give their opinions of the research.  A menu of
 
options is included in the detailed EFIC plan in the MoP and includes mechanisms such as
 
community meetings, town hall meetings, focus groups, meetings with established community
 
advisory boards, in-person surveys, and random-digit dialing surveys.  The specific type of
 
community consultation will be determined by each site’s IRB.  Reporting of community
 
consultation results will be standardized across the ESETT sites.
 
Public Disclosure
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: 
…
.(ii) Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation
 
will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical
 
investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits; (iii) Public
 
disclosure of sufficient information following completion of the clinical investigation to apprise
 
the community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the
 
research population, and its results
 
Public disclosure is the primary element in making certain that ESETT is conducted in an entirely
 
transparent manner. Methods of announcing information about the trial, and the development
 
of advertising and other materials about the trial, will take place both locally and nationally.
 
Public disclosure will be initiated prior to approval of the trial, may continue during enrollment,
 
and will conclude with dissemination of study results after the trial is completed. A menu and
 
 
 
38
  
discussion of many public disclosure methods and procedures is detailed in the EFIC plan in the
 
MoP.  Each site IRB will determine the type and form of local public disclosure.  Reporting of
 
public disclosure efforts will be standardized. Summaries of public disclosure will be reported to
 
each IRB, and composite reports of local and national public disclosure at the trial-level will be
 
provided to the FDA docket.
 
Data Monitoring Committee
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: 
…
.(iv) Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise
 
oversight of the clinical investigation;
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is appointed by the NINDS to provide ongoing
 
evaluation of safety data as well as the overall conduct of the trial, per institute guidelines. The
 
members will have a meeting with the study team prior to study commencement to discuss the
 
protocol as well as content and format of the DSMB reports. The SDMC will prepare requested
 
reports at specified time intervals. Data and safety monitoring will be performed consistent
 
with the guidance provided by the NIH notices 98-084 “Policy for data and safety monitoring”
 
and OD-00-038 “Further guidance on data and safety monitoring for phase I and phase II trials”,
 
and by the NINDS document based on these notices “NINDS Guidelines for Data and Safety
 
Monitoring in Clinical Trials”.
 
Contacting Other Family
 
21 CFR 50.24(a)(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects will be provided,
 
including, at least: 
…
. (v) If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized
 
representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to
 
attempting to contact within the therapeutic window the subject's family member who is not a
 
legally authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's
 
participation in the clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact
 
family members and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review.
 
It will not be ethically possible in ESETT, for the reasons described above, to delay treatment of
 
the seizing subject long enough to contact either an LAR or other family members. A provision
 
of the protocol has been made to allow subjects that learn of the trial through public disclosure
 
efforts or other means, and who would not want to participate if treated in the ED for status
 
epilepticus, to communicate that decision to the ED without causing any delay in treatment. As
 
part of the primary assessment of a seizing patient, ED providers already check for medical alert
 
jewelry to ascertain emergent medical information about the patient. If the words “ESETT
 
declined,” or alternative designation as defined in the MoP, are listed on the medical alert tag,
 
the patient will not be enrolled in the clinical investigation. Medical alert tags are commonly
 
used by people with epilepsy already, and provide a means of communication that does not
 
require such patients to wear any extra marker. Since they are already worn daily, they do not
 
require additional effort to use once information is added to the tag. The tags are common and
 
 
 
39
  
effective for communicating information to medics while still being inconspicuous. Use of this
 
enrollment exclusion will be tracked and this information made available to IRBs at the time of
 
continuing review.
 
Post Enrollment Notification and Consent to Continue
 
21 CFR 50.24(b) The IRB is responsible for ensuring that procedures are in place to inform, at the
 
earliest feasible opportunity, each subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally
 
authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a
 
family member, of the subject's inclusion in the clinical investigation, the details of the
 
investigation and other information contained in the informed consent document. The IRB shall
 
also ensure that there is a procedure to inform the subject, or if the subject remains
 
incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not
 
reasonably available, a family member, that he or she may discontinue the subject's participation
 
at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. If a
 
legally authorized representative or family member is told about the clinical investigation and the
 
subject's condition improves, the subject is also to be informed as soon as feasible. If a subject is
 
entered into a clinical investigation with waived consent and the subject dies before a legally
 
authorized representative or family member can be contacted, information about the clinical
 
investigation is to be provided to the subject's legally authorized representative or family
 
member, if feasible.
 
Subjects enrolled in ESETT, or their legally authorized representatives (LAR) or family, are
 
informed of the subject’s inclusion in the clinical investigation at the earliest possible
 
opportunity as detailed above and in the MoP. It is anticipated that the notification of subjects,
 
or their families or LAR, will most commonly take place in the ED within hours of subject
 
enrollment. Attempts to notify the subject or an LAR are repeated until successful. All
 
notification attempts are logged and recorded in the subjects online case report form in
 
WebDCU
™
. Reports of these logs will be available for inclusion in annual reports to the
 
respective IRBs.
 
Record Keeping
 
21 CFR 50.24(c) Like other IRB records, records of the determinations above must be kept for a
 
minimum of three years after the completion of the clinical investigation. Again, like other IRB
 
records, these are subject to inspection and copying by FDA.
 
Records documenting the enrollment of patients using EFIC, procedures for notification of
 
enrollment, and informed consent forms will be kept for a minimum of three years after
 
completion of the clinical investigation.
 
IND Requirement
 
21 CFR 50.24(d) Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this
 
section must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or
 
investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may
 
include subjects who are unable to consent. The submission of those protocols in a separate
 
IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device
 
already exists. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as
 
 
 
40
  
amendments under Secs. 312.30 or 812.35 of this chapter.
 
This trial requires an IND, review and approval by the FDA. No enrollment can commence
 
unless approval by the FDA and participating IRBs is obtained. The Study Principal Investigator
 
serves as the sponsor of the IND. Discussions with the FDA have clarified that a single IND is
 
appropriate for the proposed trial.
 
Communication of IRB Determinations
 
21 CFR 50.24(e) If an IRB determines that it cannot approve a clinical investigation because the
 
investigation does not meet the criteria in the exception provided under paragraph (a) of this
 
section or because of other relevant ethical concerns, the IRB must document its findings and
 
provide these findings promptly in writing to the clinical investigator and to the sponsor of the
 
clinical investigation. The sponsor of the clinical investigation must promptly disclose this
 
information to FDA and to the sponsor's clinical investigators who are participating or are asked
 
to participate in this or a substantially equivalent clinical investigation of the sponsor, and to
 
other IRBs that have been, or are, asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation
 
by that sponsor.
 
If an application for ESETT is disapproved by a local IRB at any site, the Hub principal
 
investigator will inform the ESETT principal investigator and IND sponsor and provide him with
 
the written findings of that IRB. The Study PI/sponsor will promptly disclose this information to
 
the FDA, and to all participating Hub PIs who will be instructed to submit these to all IRBs to
 
which applications for ESETT have been submitted for review. If there is a change in the study
 
protocol, then there must be a re-review of the protocol by all the IRBs of the participating
 
institutions.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
41
  
6. STUDY ENROLLMENT PROCEDURE
 
6.1  Screening
 
The goal is to include all eligible patients who present to participating EDs.  All patients
 
presenting with a diagnosis of seizures or convulsions will be evaluated for participation in the
 
study.  A screen failure log will include patients with a diagnosis of seizures or status epilepticus
 
who are not randomized into ESETT.
 
 
6.2  Enrollment
 
Study processes will not delay clinical treatment.  When an eligible patient presents to the
 
emergency department, the clinical team will access the age appropriate ESETT “use next” box.
 
To ensure treatment is not delayed, the “use next” box must be easily accessible and
 
maintained in proximity to patient care in the ED.  Most often, this will be in the secured ED
 
medication dispensing system or the ED pharmacy.
 
 
The clinical team opens the “use next” box.  The protocol assist device is activated.  The weight
 
based infusion rate is determined from the dose administration chart.  If the patient is a child,
 
the length based weight estimation tool is used to determine dose unless an accurate weight is
 
known.  An infusion pump is programmed with the determined rate and the infusion line is
 
primed.  The infusion is then started and the timer is started on the protocol assist device.
 
 
The study team should be alerted at this time, if not already done.
 
Study drug is administered by pump for ten minutes (except as noted in section 7.3).  The
 
infusion is then discontinued and discarded.  The patient should then be observed for 10 more
 
minutes, until 20 minutes after the start of study drug infusion.  Rescue therapy is not indicated
 
during this period.  After 10 minutes from the end of study drug infusion, rescue therapy should
 
be given as deemed clinically indicated by the care team for persistent or recurrent seizures.
 
The primary outcome is determined at 60 minutes.
 
6.3  Study Team Arrival
 
The study team should be activated as early as possible without delaying treatment.  The care
 
team follows the protocol but does not engage in research.  Questions about eligibility are
 
determined by the study team.  The study team will arrive in the ED as soon as possible.
 
 
Upon arrival, the study team will assist the clinical team in completing the protocol.  After
 
arrival the study team will seek an LAR to notify of the subject’s participation and to determine
 
consent to continue.  The study team maintains a log of attempts to locate an LAR, of
 
notifications, and of consent decisions.
 
 
 
42
  
The study team will collect and complete the ED-enrollment case report form, will collect the
 
spent “use next” box and protocol assist device, and will process, reload, and place a new “use
 
next” box.
 
6.4  Blood Draw
 
Up to 2 tubes of blood, approximately 5 mL total (2.5 mL each), may be drawn from a subset of
 
subjects after the study drug infusion to confirm drug levels and accurate assignment as needed
 
to ensure study performance.

7. STUDY INTERVENTIONS
 
7.1  Determination of subject weight
 
The rate of study drug infusion is based on estimated patient weight.  The subject’s weight may
 
be obtained from reliable caregivers or records.  In children, if an accurate weight is not known,
 
dose will be determined using the length-based weight/dose estimation tool included in the
 
“use next” box, (akin to the Broselow tape).  In adults and the elderly, weight will be estimated
 
in the manner as in standard care for weight-based dosing of other resuscitation/critical care
 
drugs.  A measured weight may also be used if available, but it is expected that the clinical
 
scenario will usually preclude weighing the subject.
 
 
7.2  Study drug administration
 
Study drugs will be administered intravenously.  For purposes of this study, intraosseous (IO)
 
access will always be considered equivalent to IV access.  Infusion pumps will be used to ensure
 
that study drug is administered over 10 minutes.
 
 
The infusion pump will be programmed to deliver the volume/rate indicated on the dose
 
administration chart (table 3).  The volume and rate will be confirmed by a second nurse.
 
Infusion will last 10 minutes.  Priming the line prior to infusion and removing the line at the end
 
of infusion are performed in a manner that ensures the entire study volume of study drug is
 
delivered in accordance with local nursing practice.

7.3  Study Drug Infusion Precautions
 
Study drug infusion precautions are the same as in standard care in patients with status
 
epilepticus.  Heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation are monitored.
 
 
If hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia occur during study drug infusion, the infusion rate will be
 
reduced by 50% (increasing the infusion time and maintaining the planned volume).
 
In this context, hypotension is defined as sustained systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg in
 
subjects 13 years and older, <80 mm Hg for 7 years to <13 years, and <70 mm Hg for 2 years to
 
<7 years.  Intravenous fluid may also be used for initial treatment of hypotension.
 
If hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia persist, or as determined appropriate by the care team,
 
the drug infusion will be discontinued.  Persistent hypotension or arrhythmia will be treated
 
 
 
45
  
according to local standard care after the study drug is stopped.
 
Treatment with study drug may also be terminated for any serious adverse event during
 
infusion that the treating physician believes is study drug related.
 
Discontinuation of study drug does not affect participation of the subject in the study.  All
 
subjects should be followed until they reach their end of study.
 
7.4  Randomization
 
Due to the emergency nature of ESE, randomization must not delay treatment.   To complete
 
the randomization quickly, the study drug will be preassigned using a central randomization
 
process via WebDCU.  The mortality associated with SE and etiology of SE varies with age. In
 
addition, certain adverse effects of drugs such as hypotension are more common in the elderly
 
compared to the pediatric age group. For these reasons, randomization assignments will be
 
stratified by age group (less than 18 years, 18-65 years, and greater than 65 years).
 
 
Prior to enrollment at each site, the randomization assignment is made [for each of the three
 
age strata]. The assigned study drug is installed in the “use next” box.  When the next eligible
 
subject at the clinical site is identified, the ED nurse or physician, selects the “use next” box [for
 
that stratum].
 
 
Once the infusion pump, connected to study drug vial and patient’s IV catheter, is turned on,
 
the patient is considered to have been randomized into the study.  After a patient is
 
randomized and the study team member enters the randomization form into WebDCU, the
 
next treatment assignment is made, and a new “use next” box can be prepared.  Hence, after
 
each subject is randomized, the treatment assignment is made for the subsequent subject
 
(within that stratum) once the current subject’s randomization data are entered into WebDCU.
 
Sites may also be contacted and asked to go to WebDCU to reassign the content of the “use
 
next” box when randomization in the trial is updated.
 
 
7.5  Study Drug
 
Study drug will be produced at the central pharmacy, a GMP facility at University of California,
 
Davis.  Diluted formulations are expected to remain stable for months when stored at 2-8 °C.
 
Expiration dates for study drug will be determined and adjusted based upon ongoing stability
 
testing performed on study drugs prepared at the GMP facility for the study.
 
All three formulations will be pale yellow solutions.  None are reported to consistently cause
 
infusion-site adverse effects.  The method of drug administration, including volume and rate of
 
infusion is identical for all three drugs.  These factors ensure that drug administration will be
 
 
 
46
  
blinded.
 
The drugs will be formulated in the following concentrations:  FOS 16.66 mg PE/ml, VPA 33.33
 
mg/ml and LEV 50 mg/ml.  The dose will be FOS 20 mg PE/kg, VPA 40 mg/kg, and LEV 60 mg/kg,
 
increasing up to a weight of 75 kg.  At this weight the maximum safe dose for a 10 minute
 
infusion period for adults is reached.  A 10 kg patient would receive drug infusion at the rate of
 
1.2 ml/min and those weighing 75 kg or more will receive drugs at an infusion rate of 9 ml/min.
 
 
7.6  Study Drug Packaging
 
 
Study drug will be prepared in 100 mL glass vials, labeled as investigational, and coded with
 
unique human readable ID numbers and barcodes.  Because this is a blinded study, nobody at
 
the site (local pharmacy, clinical team, and study team) will know whether the next assignment
 
is FOS, VPA, or LEV.
 
 
“Use next” boxes will be prepared at the site and contain:  1) a 100 ml glass vial containing
 
either FOS, VPA, or LEV, 2) a dose administration chart, 3) a protocol assist device, and 4) a
 
length based weight/dose estimation tape (similar to Broselow tape).
 
 
7.7  Protocol Assist Device
 
The protocol assist device is a mobile electronic platform, such as the Apple iPod Touch, with an
 
ESETT app loaded on it.  It is intended to assist the clinical and study team in performing the
 
study protocol.  The app will be started by the treating physician or nurse and will guide the
 
team through the initial phase of the study. The device is intended to serve several functions
 
including: confirmation of correct randomization code, time keeping during infusion and
 
evaluation, supplemental data logging, and support of rapid emergency unblinding.
 
 
The protocol assist device should be kept at subject’s bedside until retrieved by the study team.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
47
  
8.  OUTCOME ASSESSMENT AND POST-INTERVENTION
 
 
8.1  Assessment of treatment effect
 
 
Assessment of treatment effect is performed at 20 minutes and 60 minutes after the start of
 
study drug infusion.
 
 
“Start of study drug infusion” is considered the time of randomization.  It is the time when the
 
study drug infusion is begun by starting the IV infusion pump.
 
Absence of clinically apparent seizure at 20 and 60 minutes is determined clinically.  Clinically
 
apparent seizure is defined as obvious focal or generalized tonic clonic movements, nystagmoid
 
or rhythmic eye movements, or generalized or segmental myoclonus at the time of assessment.
 
 
Patient’s responsiveness to verbal command or noxious stimuli is observed at 20 and 60
 
minutes.  Responsiveness at time of assessment is always compared to that at the time of
 
randomization. Generally, improvements in responsiveness are characterized by purposeful
 
responses to noxious stimuli, the ability to follow commands, or verbalization.  The Richmond
 
Agitation Scale Score will be recorded and may be used to assist in this determination.
 
 
8.2  Determination of primary outcome
 
The primary outcome will be determined 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion.  The
 
primary outcome may be determined by the study team if present, or by a treating ED physician
 
on the clinical team if the study team is not yet available.  The primary outcome is based upon
 
the assessment of treatment effect at 60 minutes as defined above, and the use of additional
 
anti-seizure medications.  Ongoing seizures at the time of determination of the primary
 
outcome, whether persistently or recurringly, indicates a failure to meet the primary outcome.
 
Transient seizure recurrence followed by cessation, however, is consistent with meeting the
 
primary outcome.
 
 
Medications qualifying as “anti-seizure medications” for the purpose of determining the
 
primary outcome are detailed in the study Manual of Procedures.  The administration of the
 
these anticonvulsant or sedative medications for recurrent seizures or any other reason, by any
 
route, within 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion indicates a failure to meet the
 
primary outcome.
 
The primary outcome should be based on the assessment of what the treatment effect and the
 
condition of the patient were at 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion based upon all
 
information available to the assessor at the time the primary outcome is documented.
 
Death prior to 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion indicates a failure to meet the
 
primary outcome.
 
 
 
 
48
  
The primary outcome may be documented in more than one location.  The highest level of
 
source document in the established hierarchy will be considered the primary source document
 
for the primary outcome.  The hierarchy of source documents that will be used to confirm the
 
primary outcome outcome is:
 
1.
Contemporaneous observation and documentation.  The primary outcome is observed
 
by the study team at the bedside and directly recorded on the CRF or on the study book
 
worksheet.  Direct data entry in WebDCU is preferred but not required.
 
 
2.
Direct communication with the clinical team.  The study obtains the primary outcome
 
data by direct explicit communication with the treating ED attending physician.
 
Communication should occur and be documented as close to the time of assessment as
 
possible.
 
3.
Protocol Assist Device.  The primary outcome explicitly recorded on the protocol assist
 
device will be treated as a source document and may be used to complete the CRF if
 
contemporaneous recording or direct communication with the study team are not
 
available.
 
4.
Medical Record - explicit study specific documentation.  If the medical record is used as
 
a source document, the adjudicators will determine the primary outcome from an
 
explicit study specific template note if available in precedence among available
 
documentation.
 
5.
Medical Record - implicit review.  If the medical record is used as a source document,
 
and no explicit study specific template note is available, the adjudicators will determine
 
the primary outcome from their interpretation of provided documentation.
 
8.3  Determination of secondary outcomes
 
The primary safety outcome is the absence of life threatening hypotension and cardiac
 
arrhythmia within 60 minutes of the start of study drug infusion.
 
 
Life-threatening hypotension is defined as systolic blood pressure remaining below the
 
age-specified thresholds on two consecutive readings at least 10 minutes apart and remaining
 
below the age-specified thresholds for more than 10 minutes after reduction of the rate of
 
study drug infusion rate (or its termination) and a fluid challenge.  The “age-specified
 
thresholds” for systolic blood pressure are 90 mmHg in adults and children 13 years and older,
 
80 mmHg in children 7 to 12 years old, and 70 mmHg in children through 6 years of age.
 
Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia is defined as any arrhythmia that persists despite reducing
 
rate of study drug infusion, and that requires termination with chest compressions, pacing,
 
defibrillation, or use of  an antiarrhythmic agent or procedure.
 
Additional predefined safety outcomes include mortality, need for endotracheal intubation
 
 
 
49
  
within 60 minutes of start of study drug infusion, acute seizure recurrence within 12 hours, and
 
acute anaphylaxis.
 
Mortality is determined by survival to subject end-of-study (hospital discharge or 30 days,
 
whichever comes first).  All causes of mortality are included.
 
Need for endotracheal intubation within 60 minutes of start of study drug infusion includes any
 
placement or attempt at placement of a definitive tracheal airway (orotracheal, nasotracheal,
 
cricothyroidotomy, or tracheostomy) for support of respirations or protection of airway.  The
 
use of non-definitive and/or non-tracheal airways (oral or nasal airways, laryngeal mask
 
airways, or esophageal obturator airways) is not included if the patient is not subsequently
 
intubated unless specifically deemed to have been used in lieu of tracheal intubation.
 
The RASS may be determined by the care team or the study team.  The RASS scoring system is
 
fully described in the manual of procedures.
 
Acute recurrent seizure is defined as definitive convulsive or electroencephalographic seizure
 
activity triggering further anticonvulsant therapy occurring between 60 minutes and 12 hours
 
after the start of study drug infusion. This definition does not include those given further
 
anticonvulsants as secondary prophylaxis or as treatment for vague or uncertain exam findings
 
or nondiagnostic electroencephalography.
 
 
Acute anaphylaxis is defined as a clinical presentation consistent with life threatening allergic
 
reaction occurring within 6 hours of the start of study drug infusions and manifested as
 
urticaria in combination with either (1) a systolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg sustained for
 
greater than 5 minutes, or (2) objective evidence of airway obstruction, and for which the
 
patient was treated with antihistamines and/or steroids.
 
 
Respiratory depression is defined as impairment of ventilation or oxygenation necessitating
 
definitive endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.  It is distinct from intubations
 
performed only for airway protection in those with decreased levels of consciousness.   It does
 
not include those getting only supraglottic airways or transient bag-valve-mask support.
 
Secondary efficacy outcomes include time to termination of seizures, admission to ICU, and the
 
length of ICU and hospital stays.
 
 
The time to termination of seizures is the interval from the start of infusion of study drug to
 
cessation of clinically apparent seizure in those who meet the primary outcome.
 
 
Hospital and ICU admission from the ED, and length of stay, is abstracted from the hospital
 
admission record. ICU admission is recorded as occurring only if the ICU is the initial inpatient
 
unit for the patient.  Length of stay is determined by the number of calendar days after the day
 
 
 
50
  
of ED arrival until hospital discharge or subject end-of-study.
 
8.4  Endotracheal intubation
 
Elective or semi-elective endotracheal intubation (e.g. for imaging studies, etc.) should be
 
delayed until after determination of primary outcome if possible.  Emergency endotracheal
 
intubation should not be delayed.  The need for emergency intubation is determined by the
 
care team.  It is generally not necessary to perform emergency endotracheal intubation for
 
prolonged unresponsiveness alone in this patient population.  Emergent or elective
 
endotracheal intubation and its indication should be carefully documented, including all
 
medications administered.
 
 
8.5  Rescue anticonvulsants
 
Subjects who do not respond to the study drug and continue to seize >20 minutes after the
 
start of study drug infusion (>10 minutes after the completion of study drug infusion) will need
 
additional anticonvulsant therapy for SE at the discretion of the treating team. The treating
 
physician will follow local practice guidelines in choice of a third line agent for the treatment of
 
SE.  Appropriate third line choices include phenobarbital or a general anesthetic such as
 
propofol, midazolam or pentobarbital when a second-line agent has failed.  Finally, some
 
centers may choose to use another second line agent.  If the care team feels that another
 
second line agent is indicated and that knowledge of the study drug given is needed to guide
 
this selection, emergency unblinding should proceed as described below in section 10.2.
 
 
8.6  Continuous EEG
 
Continuous EEG should be performed as indicated by the care team consistent with standard
 
clinical practice.  If indicated, cEEG should be initiated as early as possible.
 
 
8.7  Standard supportive care
 
Other than as indicated in this protocol, subjects will receive the usual care and evaluation
 
provided at each site.  Sites may wish to reference the practice parameter recommendations
 
for status epilepticus of the American Academy of Neurology (Riviello 2006).
 
 
 
 
 
51
  
9. ADVERSE EVENTS
 
9.1 Definitions of Adverse Events:
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical
 
treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or
 
procedure. An AE is a term that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical
 
documentation and scientific analyses.
 
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse event that is fatal or life threatening, is
 
permanently or substantially disabling, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a
 
congenital anomaly, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. For
 
the purposes of this study, we specifically exclude hospitalization for the sole purpose of
 
observing a patient after SE as a Serious Adverse Event.
 
9.2 Grading of Adverse Events
 
All adverse events (AEs) occurring within 24 hours of treatment and all serious adverse events
 
occurring during study participation will be documented on the AE case report form. The
 
severity of adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
 
Adverse Events (Version 4.03, June 2010, CTCAE). The CTCAE provides a grading (severity) scale
 
for each AE term and AEs are listed alphabetically within categories based on anatomy or
 
pathophysiology. The CTCAE (v 4.03) displays Grades 1-5 with unique clinical descriptions of
 
severity for each AE based on this general guidance:
 
Table 4.
 
 
Grades
 
Descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline
 
Grade 1 Mild
 
Asymptomatic or mild  symptoms; clinical or diagnostic
 
observations only; intervention not indicated
 
Grade 2 Moderate
 
minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate
 
instrumental activities of daily living.
 
 
Grade 3 Severe
 
medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or
 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL
 
Grade 4
 
Life-threatening
 
 
urgent intervention indicated
 
Grade 5 Fatal
 
Death related to AE
 
 
Severity is not equivalent to seriousness. A serious adverse event (SAE) would be any event in
 
 
 
52
  
category 4 or 5, and any event in category 3 that required or prolonged hospitalization. Not all
 
grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than five options
 
for Grade Selection i.e., Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an
 
option.
 
 
9.3  Relationship to Study Treatment
 
 
One of the most important components of AE reporting is determining the cause of the AE. It is
 
imperative that the investigator assess AE causality in terms of overall study participation and
 
make an independent determination as to whether the AE was thought to be related to any
 
study-related activity (i.e., study intervention,). Determination may be particularly challenging
 
in ESETT since typical criteria for assessing causality such as evaluation of the effects of
 
de-challenge and re-challenge are not possible within the scope of this protocol in which study
 
interventions are isolated single exposures of short acting medications. In addition the
 
underlying cause of SE: stroke, infection, inflammation  etc.  cause adverse events. Finally,
 
prolonged seizures of SE cause adverse events.  For each adverse event, the relationship to the
 
study treatment must be recorded as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, not related.  The
 
NETT modified “Algorithm to Determine Relationship of Adverse Event to Study Agent” will be
 
used for all relatedness determinations in ESETT, and is found in the Manual of Procedures.
 
9.4  Adverse Event Reporting
 
All AEs occurring within 24 hours of study treatment and all serious adverse events (SAEs)
 
occurring until participation in study has ended (discharge from the hospital, death, or 30 days
 
since enrollment)  are recorded on the online AE case report form (CRF) through the
 
WebDCU
™
. The site PI or Study Coordinator or designee is responsible for entering all AEs and
 
SAEs and updating the information (e.g., date of resolution, action taken) in a timely manner.
 
All non-serious AEs must be recorded on the electronic AE CRF within 5 days from the time it
 
was discovered by the site study personnel. For SAEs, the data entry must take place within 24
 
hours of discovery of the event.
 
The site PI is responsible for the monitoring and follow-up of AEs until resolution (or end of
 
study for that subject) and appropriate documentation in the subject research record. In
 
addition to performing protocol-specified follow up, the participating PI must review all
 
previously reported ongoing AEs to evaluate the current status. If an AE that was previously
 
reported on the Adverse Event CRF fully resolves and then recurs at a later date, the second
 
occurrence is considered a new AE and a new Adverse Event CRF must be completed. Likewise,
 
if an SAE that was previously reported and subsequently fully resolved later recurs at a level
 
requiring expedited reporting, the SAE must be reported as a new SAE on the Adverse Event
 
CRF.
 
 
 
53
  
 
9.5 Expected Adverse Events
 
Expected adverse events include side effects known to be potentially associated with the study
 
medications as listed in the study drug package inserts, and complications that commonly occur
 
as a result of the underlying condition or as a result of hospital care.  The outcomes and events
 
defined below are likely and anticipated and will be closely tracked.
 
These include the secondary safety outcomes previously defined in section 8.3:
 
●
Life-threatening hypotension
 
●
Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia
 
●
Mortality
 
●
Need for endotracheal intubation
 
●
Acute recurrent seizure
 
 
●
Acute anaphylaxis
 
●
Respiratory depression or failure resulting in intubation.
 
Other defined expected adverse events include:
 
Hepatic transaminase or ammonia elevations, defined as those levels determined by the site
 
investigator to be greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal or otherwise clinically
 
significant.
 
Purple glove syndrome, defined as the presence of all three of the findings of objective edema,
 
discoloration, and pain in the distal extremity in which study drug was administered, with or
 
without known extravasation, and for which there is no other evident etiology.
 
9.6  Clinical Management of Adverse Events
 
All adverse events will be managed according to local institution guidelines and treating
 
physician’s judgment. Specific recommendations for managing acute adverse events during
 
drug infusion are included above in Section 7.3.
 
 
 
 
 
54
  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
10.1 Randomization
 
The randomization scheme will be equal allocation (1:1:1) for the first 300 patients. Once 300
 
subjects are enrolled, response-adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of
 
maximizing the likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm (Connor 2013). The
 
target allocation ratio will be updated every 100 patients. We will use a “Step Forward”
 
centralized randomization procedure developed for emergency treatment trials. (Zhao 2010)
 
Randomization will be stratified by age.
 
10.2 Blinding and unblinding:
 
Patients and emergency department study team members are blinded to the treatment
 
assignment, as are the PIs and clinical coordinating center (CCC). Blinding is provided by the use
 
of the same color of formulations, same drug packaging, and same method of drug
 
administration in every subject.
 
 
Emergency unblinding may be required if the treating team feels that subjects’ care after the
 
study intervention requires knowledge of what study drug was given.  Emergency unblinding
 
will not be performed within 60 minutes of the start of study drug infusion.  The blind should be
 
maintained until after the primary outcome has been collected.
 
 
Emergency unblinding performed prior to 60 minutes or prior to determination of the primary
 
outcome, because of physician judgment that it is necessary for the safety or care of the
 
patient, or because of unanticipated situations is accommodated by calling the hotline but is a
 
deviation from this protocol.
 
10.3 Primary outcome
 
A patient is considered a treatment success if they meet the definition of the primary outcome
 
as defined above.
 
10.4 Secondary outcomes
 
Secondary outcomes are intended to show safety, congruence or divergence from the primary
 
outcome, or to provide additional detail that helps to more fully describe or interpret the
 
effects of the treatment, the study population, or the clinical scenario.
 
10.5  Primary Analysis
 
The posterior probabilities that each treatment is the most and least effective treatment will be
 
calculated using Bayesian methods. This trial will be considered a success if the probability that
 
a treatment is the most effective is greater than 0.975  or the probability that a treatment is the
 
 
 
55
  
least effective is greater than 0.975 for any treatment.
 
Each of the three treatment arms is modeled independently.  We assume the probability of
 
response has a uniform Beta(1,1) prior distribution.  We assume the number of responses on
 
each treatment arm follows a binomial distribution.  We update the prior distribution with the
 
observed data and use the resulting posterior distribution to calculate the probability that each
 
treatment is the most effective and the probability that each treatment is the least effective.
 
The posterior distribution for each treatment arm will therefore be Beta(1+ # of Successes, 1+ #
 
of Failures).
 
At the conclusion of the trial, we will report the response rates for each treatment group with
 
95% credible intervals and the pairwise differences in responses rates and corresponding 95%
 
credible intervals of those differences.
 
10.6  Frequentist Analysis of the Primary Outcome
 
At the final analysis, the global null hypothesis that the probabilities of success for all three
 
treatment groups are equal will be tested in a chi-squared test with 2 degrees of freedom. If,
 
and only if, the three-way, global null hypothesis is rejected, then all pairwise comparisons will
 
be performed as a two-sample test of difference in proportions (Z - test). Although the
 
Frequentist tests will only occur once, we will use Pocock boundaries to control the overall
 
alpha.
 
10.7  Interim Analyses
 
Interim monitoring for success and futility will begin after 400 subjects have been randomized
 
and will be repeated after every additional 100 subjects are randomized. This trial will stop
 
early for success if we have identified the maximum effective treatment with a least 97.5%
 
probability.
 
There are two early futility criteria.  The first futility rule will stop the trial early if all treatment
 
arms have a clinically unacceptable response rate.  The second futility rule will stop the trial
 
early if all treatments are performing similarly and we will be unable to identify a most effective
 
or least effective treatment.
 
Following review of both the interim analysis results and safety data, the DSMB will make a
 
recommendation regarding the above stopping rules.
 
 
10.8  Estimated accrual
 
Estimates of accrual for purposes of statistical planning assume 40 enrollment sites averaging 5
 
subjects per year over a 4 year enrollment period.
 
 
 
 
56
  
10.9  Sample size considerations
 
This study will enroll a maximum total sample size of approximately 795 patients over 4 years,
 
at an accrual rate of approximately 16.5 patients per month. A sample size of 795 provides
 
approximately 90% power to identify the most effective treatment when one treatment arm
 
has a true response rate of 65% and the true response rate is 50% in the other two arms (an
 
absolute difference of 15%). The trial operating characteristics were determined via an
 
extensive simulation study. The statistical and full simulation details as well as the operating
 
characteristics of the design have been published (Connor 2013).
 
The expected response rates for FOS, LEV and VPA are based on the retrospective analysis of
 
279 episodes of established SE in adults, who were treated with PHT, LEV or VPA (Alvarez
 
2011).  The study reported 59.6% of patient episodes responded to PHT, 51.7% to LEV and
 
74.6% to VPA. Based on this study and expert evaluation of all currently published data on the
 
treatment of established SE, we expect that the worst drug will be effective in 50% of the
 
patients. A 15% difference is the minimum clinically important difference sufficient to change
 
clinical practice.
 
The total sample size for this trial corresponds to the sample size that would be needed for a
 
frequentist analysis. A sample size of 209/group (627 total) is needed for a chi-squared
​
 
​
test with
 
2 degrees of freedom of the overall test of equality of the three proportions with 90% power
 
(assuming the smallest proportion is 0.50 and the largest proportion is 0.65 and the average
 
proportion is 0.55, two-sided alpha 0.05). For a two-sample test of proportions (all pairwise
 
comparisons of treatment groups), with equal allocation into each treatment group, when one
 
treatment proportion is 0.50 and the other treatment proportion is 0.65, the sample size
 
needed is 240 per group to detect an absolute treatment difference as small as 0.15 with 90%
 
power (assuming two-sided alpha 0.05 and interim looks). Thus, a total sample size of 240*3
 
groups=720 (uninflated for re-enrollers, missing data). Given the possibility of re-enrollers,
 
protocol violations, and missing data, the maximum sample size was inflated from 720 up to
 
795  by N`=720*R where R=(1/(1-.025)^2)*1.05. The sample size was inflated in two ways. First,
 
for the re-enrollers (expected to be 5%) who will be excluded from the analysis. Secondly, to
 
account for the impact of treatment cross-overs, protocol violations, and missing data on the
 
ITT analysis (expected to occur 2.5% of the time). In order to determine the operating
 
characteristics for this Bayesian adaptive design, simulations were performed assuming a
 
maximum sample size of 720 (the uninflated maximum) and considering different response rate
 
scenarios.
 
10.10  Missing Data and Non-compliance
 
The primary analysis will be analyzed under the intent-to-treat principle (ITT).  The ITT
 
evaluable sample will include all subjects who are randomized. Subjects that are enrolled more
 
 
 
57
  
than once during the study period will have only their first enrollment included in the primary
 
analysis. It is anticipated that a maximum of 5% of subjects will be re-enrolled. In an ITT
 
analysis, missing data and treatment cross-overs can be problematic. Due to the short term
 
endpoint, minimal missing data is expected for the primary outcome.  However the inability to
 
administer the full dose of the study drug, or other protocol violations may occur and attenuate
 
the treatment effect. It is anticipated that a maximum of 2.5% of data will be missing or involve
 
treatment cross-overs. Any missing values will be considered a treatment failure.
 
 
10.11 Secondary Analyses
 
Secondary analyses of primary outcome will include an analysis of the adjudicated primary
 
outcome, a re-enroller analysis, a per protocol analysis, an analysis by age. Exploratory analyses
 
of the primary outcome will assess treatment differences adjusting for etiology, time from
 
seizure onset to randomization, and enrolling site. Clinically important differences in the
 
treatment effect due to sex/gender, racial, or ethnic differences are not expected, but will be
 
explored. Secondary and exploratory  analyses will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons.
 
10.12  Analysis of Secondary Outcomes
 
The secondary outcomes will be compared by treatment group.  All secondary outcomes will be
 
tested at a significance level of two-sided alpha of 0.05. Binary outcomes will be compared by
 
first testing the null hypothesis that the proportion of responses for all three treatment groups
 
are equal in a chi-squared test. If the three-way null hypothesis is rejected, then all pairwise
 
comparisons will be performed as two-sample tests of proportions. Continuous outcomes will
 
be compared in an F-test to test the null hypothesis that all three treatment groups are equal,
 
followed by pairwise t-tests. Kaplan Meier curves and log rank tests will be used to compare
 
time to event outcomes by treatment group.
 
10.13  Pediatric Subgroup Analysis
 
The interaction of age group and treatment group will be tested at each interim analysis. If
 
there is sufficient evidence of an interaction, then the response-adaptive randomization will be
 
stopped and randomization will revert to equal allocation until the end of the trial.
 
Regardless of whether an interaction between age group and treatment is detected, the
 
primary analysis will be redone by age group (children age 2-18, adult 19-65, and Seniors, >65).

11. DATA COLLECTION
 
11.1  Study activity and data collection
 
Follow up data collection: Very limited clinical data will be collected during hospitalization,
 
beyond that available and collected in the ED.  Hospitalized subjects should be reevaluated the
 
day after admission for adverse events.   At the end of hospitalization, subjects should again be
 
evaluated for serious adverse events.  Seizure etiology and hospital/ICU length of stay are also
 
determined at discharge.
 
11.2  Data Collection Schedule

11.3  Quality assurance
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice
 
and all relevant local, national and international regulations.
 
Please refer to the NETT monitoring standard operating procedures (SOP) at
 
http://nett.umich.edu
​
 . In brief summary, Hub investigators will provide quality assurance
 
within their Hub spoke complex  in a process that, in this network, will be called Verification.
 
This is independent of Monitoring, which, in this network, is used to mean only independent
 
external monitoring by the NETT Project Monitor of the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC).
 
Data quality monitoring is performed continuously.  Out of range and logical errors are
 
identified at the time of data entry.
 
 
Site visits will be conducted periodically by the Project Monitor(s).  Details of the content of site
 
visits are found in the monitoring plan in the MoP.  In brief, the primary purpose of the site visit
 
is to confirm that local regulatory documents are being properly maintained, and to compare
 
data reported on case report forms with source documents, including documentation of
 
informed consent and proper reporting of adverse events.
 
 
Some combination of risk based allocation of site and remote source document verification will
 
be used over the course of the trial.
 
11.4  Data management
 
The NETT Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) will provide data management for
 
the ESETT study. The SDMC is housed in the Data Coordination Unit (DCU) at the Medical
 
University of South Carolina (MUSC). Data entry will occur at the enrolling sites using a
 
web-based data entry system, WebDCU
™
.  A central reader form will be entered into WebDCU
 
at the NETT CCC at the University of Michigan.
 
11.5  Clinical adjudication Core
 
 
The clinical adjudication core will determine key clinical characteristics for each patient enrolled
 
including the etiology of status epilepticus and the duration of seizures prior to enrollment.
 
The primary outcome is based on site determination, but the adjudication core will review all
 
primary outcomes for consistency and will determine the reasons for failure of therapy in those
 
patients who do not meet the primary outcome. Packets of de-identified medical records will
 
be available to the adjudicators as needed.  The adjudicators will be blinded to treatment
 
assignment.
 
 
 
 
61
  
12. HUMAN SUBJECTS
 
The protection of human subjects is of primary importance in clinical research and in this
 
clinical trial.  Clinical treatment teams must assess and treat patients with SE rapidly.  This trial
 
has been designed to avoid delays of treatment of even just a few minutes because longer
 
delays may increase morbidity or mortality.  See section 5 of this protocol for an extensive
 
discussion of the use of EFIC and related processes in this trial.
 
12.1  Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review
 
This protocol and the informed consent document (see template) and any subsequent
 
modifications will be reviewed and approved by the IRB for each site responsible for oversight
 
of the study.
 
 
12.2  Data and safety monitoring board (DSMB)
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appointed by the NINDS will provide ongoing
 
evaluation of safety data as well as the overall conduct of the trial.  The DSMB will be formed by
 
the NINDS as per institute guidelines. The SDMC statisticians will generate Data and Safety
 
Monitoring (DSMB) Reports semi-annually or more frequently as needed. This review will aid in
 
identifying any safety issues that may need to be addressed.
 
 
12.3  Subject Confidentiality
 
All data (case report forms, recordings, laboratory specimens, and other records) kept at the
 
site will be  physically and electronically secured to maintain subject confidentiality.  Paper
 
records and computers with subject data will be stored in locked office or cabinet.  Computer
 
records will always be password protected, and encrypted when possible.  The study database
 
is maintained behind a secure firewall, access is password protected and uses SSL encryption
 
for all data entry and access.  Clinical information will not be released without written
 
permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by the sponsor, the CCC, the
 
SDMC. the IRB, the FDA, the NINDS, or the OHRP.
 
 
12.4 Study Modification/Discontinuation
 
The study may be modified or discontinued at any time by the IRB, the NINDS, the sponsor, the
 
OHRP, the FDA, or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research
 
subjects are protected.
 
 
 
 
 
62
  
13. PUBLICATIONS AND DATA SHARING
 
Publication of the results of this trial will be governed by the policies and procedures developed
 
by the Executive Committee, and all applicable regulations and rules including reporting to

14. INTEGRATED SUB-STUDIES
 
Consistent with pre-existing scientific aims of the research team, and with recommendations of
 
peer review and trial oversight groups prior to initiation of the trial, the study leadership will,
 
contingent on funding, fully integrate additional study procedures into the clinical trial protocol
 
in support of specific supplemental aims.  As requested, the leadership has pursued ancillary
 
grant support of these aims.  These supplemental procedures relate directly to providing a
 
more complete and nuanced explanation of the trial’s outcomes, and a better understanding of
 
the underlying mechanisms of treatment response.  These integrated sub-study procedures
 
were created to ensure that they not interfere with other study procedures, and have been
 
reviewed and approved by the ESETT Data and Safety Monitoring Board.  Sub-study aims and
 
procedures are detailed in the 
​
MoP
​
.
 
14.1 Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)
 
Blood sampling as previously described at section 6.4, is used to determine the plasma levels of
 
study drugs in subjects at a fixed interval after administration.  It is anticipated that all sites
 
participate, and that samples are collected from all subjects whenever possible.  This sub-study
 
is led by Dr. Lisa Coles, with the advice and assistance of Dr. James Cloyd.
 
14.2 Emergent Electroencephalography (eEEG)
 
 
To characterize the electrographic outcomes of subjects with both clinical treatment success
 
and clinical treatment failure after study drug administration, novel application of simplified
 
EEG technology and procedures  is performed and evaluated in a subset of ESETT subjects at a
 
selected number of performance sites.  The goal is for eEEG to be acquired as early after
 
enrollment as possible and prior to the primary outcome.  Participation of sites is determined
 
by availability of equipment, site accrual rates to date, and site ability to complete the testing.
 
This sub-study is led by Drs. John Betjemann and Brian Litt.

2 OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY DESIGN 
  This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, response‐adaptive,  comparative effectiveness trial of three 
active treatments in p atients with establi shed status epileptic us (ESE) who have failed benzodiazepines. 
The primary objective is to dete rmine the most effective and/or  the least effective treatment of 
established status epilepticus ( ESE) among patients older than  2 years.  There are three active treatment 
arms being compared: fosphenytoin  (FOS), levetiracetam (LEV), a nd valproic acid (VPA). Subjects will 
initially be randomized equally to all three treatments (1:1:1  ratio). Once 300 subj ects are enrolled, 
response‐adaptive randomization  (RAR) will be utilized with the  goal of maximizing the likelihood of 
identifying the most effective tr eatment arm.  Interim analyses  are planned after 400, 500, 600 and 700 
patients are enrolled.  At each i nterim analysis, there may be  updates to the randomization 
probabilities. At each interim ana lysis, the trial may stop ear ly for success or futility. The maximum 
sample size is 795 patients total.  CONFIDENTIAL

   3 SCHEMATIC OF DESIGN
 
4 PRIMARY OUTCOME 
 
The primary outcome is clinical  cessation of status epilepticus , determined by the absence of clinically 
apparent seizures and improving  responsiveness, at 60 minutes a fter the start of study drug infusion, 
without the use of additional anti‐seizure medication. A patien t is considered a treatment success if they 
meet the definition of the prima ry outcome as defined above. 
 
5 ANALYSIS SAMPLES 
 
5.1 ITT SAMPLE 
The intent‐to‐treat sample (ITT) includes all unique patients w ho are randomized, regardless of amount 
of treatment actually received. P atients who are known to have  been enrolled more than once (re‐
enrollers) will have only their  first enrollment included in th e primary analysis.Pat ients are counted as 
CONFIDENTIAL 
ESETT Trial Statistical Ana lysis Plan    Page 4 of 17 
(Version 1: Sept 2015) 
   being a part of the treatment gr oup to which they were given at  the time of randomization (defined as 
when the infusion pump is connected to study drug vial and the  patient’s IV catheter is switched on). 
The primary analysis will use the ITT sample. 
 
5.2 PER‐PROTOCOL SAMPLE 
 
The per‐protocol sample includes  all patients who meet the stud y inclusion criteria  and who received at 
least 80% of the study drug to wh ich they were randomized.  Sec ondary analyses of the primary 
outcome will use the pe r‐protocol sample. 
  
5.3 RE‐ENROLLERS SAMPLE 
 
It is anticipated that a maximum of 5% of subjects will be re‐e nrolled. The re‐enrollers sample includes 
all patients who are in the ITT  sample.  Patients who are enrol led more than once will have each 
enrollment included in this sample .  Analyses of safety outcome s will use the re‐enrollers sample.  
  
6 RANDOMIZATION 
 
The objective of randomization i s to prevent possible selection  bias by providing random treatment 
assignment to each subject. Thr oughout the trial, randomization  will be stratified by three age groups 
(<18 years, 18‐65 years, and >65 years and older). To ensure si milar randomization probabilities across 
the three age groups while incor porating adaptive randomization , we will use a “Step Forward” 
centralized randomization procedure developed for emergency tre atment trials.2 
 
The randomization scheme will be  equal allocation (1:1:1) for t he first 300 patients. Once 300 subjects 
are enrolled, response‐adaptive  randomization (RAR) will be uti lized with the goal of maximizing the 
likelihood of identifying the mo st effective treatment arm usin g information weight ing (Connor 2013).  
Information is a measure of the  expected reduction in variance  from adding an additional patient to 
treatment arm  t and is defined for treatment arm,  t, as It = (pt Var(t)/(nt + 1))1/2  where pt is the 
probability treatment  t provides the highest success rate , t is the success rate, and  nt is the number of 
patients randomized to treatment  t.   It is calculated for all three trea tment arms, and the values are 
rescaled to produce randomization probabilities , rt  for therapy t, for the next  100 patients  as rt = It / 
(It) that sum to 1 .  The result is that better treatments are favored, but if at an  interim analysis two 
arms are equally effective, the a rm with fewer patients randomi zed to it will have a larger 
randomization probability for the next set of patients. The tar get allocation ratio will be updated every 
100 patients .  
 
7 PRIMARY ANALYSIS 
This trial will be considered a  success if the posterior probab ility that a treatment is the most effective is 
greater than 0.975 or the posteri or probability that a treatmen t is the least effective is greater than 
0.975. The posterior probabilitie s that each trea tment is the m ost and least effective treatment will be 
calculated using Bayesian methods based on a uniform beta prior  for each treatment’s success rate, and 
a conjugate beta‐binomial model1. At the conclusion of the trial , we will report the response r ate for 
each treatment group with 95% cre dible intervals as well as the  pairwise differences in response rates 
with 95% credible intervals.    CONFIDENTIAL

(Version 1: Sept 2015) 
   Each of the three treatment arms  is modeled independently.  We  assume the probability of success,  T, 
has a prior distribution,  [T] ~ Beta(1,1)  for T  {FOS, LEV, VPA}. We assume the number of 
observed successes  on each treatment,  XT, among the currently enrolled patients on treatment  T, NT, 
follows a binomial distribution.   We will update the prior dist ribution with the observed data. The 
posterior distribution for each  treatment arm will therefore be  [T |X T, NT] ~ Beta(1+ XT, 1+NT ‐XT). 
The resulting posterior distribut ion is used to calculate the p robability that each treatment is the most 
effective and the probability that  each treatment is the least  effective ( tmax and tmin, respectively). The 
probability treatment  T is the best treatment,  Pr(T = tmax) = Pr(T > X and T > Y) where  X and  Y 
represent the two treatments other than treatment  T.  Likewise, the probability treatment  T is the least 
effective treatment,  Pr(T = tmin) = Pr(T < X and T < Y).   
 
The joint posterior for the  three response rates is

These are similarly specified for VPA and fPHT.  This trial will be considered a success if  Pr(T=tmax) > 
0.975 and/or  Pr(T’=tmin) > 0.975 for any treatments  T and  T’.  This represents that the trial has 
identified the best or worst tre atment with high probability. M odel details have been published1. 
 
 
8 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
 
Interim monitoring for success and futility will begin after 40 0 patients have been enrolled and will be 
repeated after every additional  100 patients are enrolled. Thus , interim analyses will be performed after 
400, 500, 600, and 700 patients. Th is trial will stop early for  success if we have identified the maximum 
effective treatment with a t least 97.5% probability. 
 
There are two early futility cri teria.  The first futility rule  will stop the trial earl y if all treatment arms 
have a clinically unacceptable res ponse rate. This trial may st op early for futility if there is a low 
probability, less than 5%, that  any of the three treatment arms  is achieving a response rate of at least 
25%.   The second futility rule will stop the trial early if al l treatments are performing similarly and we 
will be unable to identify a most  effective or least effective  treatment. This trial will  stop early for futility fLVT,VPA,fPHT|XLVT,NLVT,XVPA,NVPA,XfPHT,NfPHT  fLVT,|XLVT,NLVT  fVPA,|XVPA,NVPA  ffPHT,|XfPHT,NfPHT CONFIDENTIAL

data, the DSMB will make a recomm endation regarding the above d ecisions.  
 
9 GENERAL SAMPLE SIZ E CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 
This study will enroll a maximum  total sample size of 795 patie nts over 4 years, at an accrual rate of 
approximately 16.5 patients per month. A maximum sample size of  795 provides 90% power to identify 
the most effective treatment when one treatment arm has a true  response rate of 65% and the true 
response rate is 50% in the othe r two arms (an absolute differe nce of 15%). The trial operating 
characteristics were determined  via an extensive simulation stu dy. The statistical and full simulation 
details as well as the operating  characteristics of the design  are provided in Appendix and have been 
published1.  
 
The expected response rates for  FOS, LEV and VPA are based on t he retrospective analysis of 279 
episodes of ESE in adults, who w ere treated with PHT, LEV or VP A3.  The study reported 59.6% of patient 
episodes responded to FOS, 51.7% t o LEV and  74.6% to VPA. Base d on this study and expert evaluation 
of all currently published data on the treatment of ESE, we exp ect that the worst drug will be effective in 
50% of the patients. A 15% difference is the minimum clinically  important difference sufficient to change 
clinical practice.  
 The total sample size for this t rial corresponds to the sample  size that would be needed for a frequentist 
analysis. A sample size of 209/gr oup (627 total) is needed for  a 
2 test with 2 degrees of freedom of the 
overall test of equality of the  three proportions with 90% powe r (assuming the smallest proportion is 
0.50 and the largest proportion  is 0.65 and the average proport ion is 0.55, two‐sided alpha 0.05). For a 
two‐sample test of proportions ( all pairwise comparisons of tre atment groups), with  equal allocation 
into each treatment group, when one treatment proportion is 0.5 0 and the other treatment proportion 
is 0.65, the sample si ze needed is 240 per  group to detect an a bsolute treatment difference as small as 
0.15 with 90% power (assuming two‐sided alpha 0.05 and interim  looks). Thus, a total sample size of 
240*3groups=720 (uninflated for re ‐enrollers, missing data). Gi ven the possibility of re‐enrollers, 
protocol violations, and missing  data, the maximum sample size  was inflated from 720 up to 795  by 
N`=720*R where R=(1/(1‐.025)^2)*1. 05. The sample size was infla ted in two ways4. First, for the re‐

   9.1 SIMULATION DETAILS 
 
 
       
Simulations of the proposed design included 1.) response‐adapti ve randomization (RAR);  2) frequent 
interim assessments, 3) a Bayesia n approach to identify the mos t and or least effective treatment. Table 
1 shows the response r ate scenarios considered in the simulatio ns. To evaluate how the design 
performs, we simulated the trial  (including the response adapti ve randomization and interim analysis) 
considering different success rate  scenarios. The operating cha racteristics are based on  100,000 
simulations per scenar io. All simulations were programmed in R.  Complete details are provided in 
Appendix. These scenarios illustra te a difference of 7.5% and 1 5% between drugs. 
 
Table 2 show the trial’s operati ng characteristics for these re sponse rate scenarios including the 
probability of identifying the  most effective treatment ( t
max) and the probability of identifying the least 
effective treatment ( tmin) and the overall probability of  trial success (last column).

   treatment arm has a 65% response  rate compared to a 50% respons e rate in the other two arms.  The 
power to correctly identify the  most effective treatment is 90% .  In the “Two Good” scenario, one arm is 
ineffective (50% response rate)  relative to the  other two (65%  response rate) and the probability of 
correctly identifying a least effective treatment is 69%.  In t he “One Middle One Good ” scenario, there is 
a modest treatment effe ct in one arm and a  strong treatment eff ect in another arm.  The power to 
correctly identify either a most  or a least effective treatment  (or both) is 68%.  The power to identify the 
best treatment in the One Good and One Middle One Good scenario s exceed the power for the same 
design with fixed randomization (90% vs. 87% and 49% vs. 45%, r espectively).1  
 
9.3 TYPE I ERROR PROBABILITY 
The type I error probability (false positive rate) of this tria l is the probability of incorrectly identifying a 
most effective treatment and/or incorrectly identifying a least  effective treatment. Under simulation, 
this is determined as the number  of trials that incorrectly ide ntify  tmax and/or tmin. Table 2 underlines the 
type I errors. In the “Null” scena rio where all treatment arms  have the same 50% re sponse rate, the 
probability of incorrectly ident ifying a maximum effective trea tment is 0.017 and the probability of 
incorrectly identifying a least  effective treatment is 0.021.   The “familywise”  type I error probability is 
well controlled (less than 0.05)  under the complete null config urations: 0.037 for the “Null” scenario, 
0.036 for the “All Bad” scenari o, and 0.005 for the “All Really  Bad” scenario (Table 2 last column). In the 
“One Good” scenario, the overall  type I error probability is 0. 04 and under the “One Middle One Good” 
scenario, the overall type I erro r probability is  0.000. In the  “Two Good” scenario,  two of the treatment 
arms have the same response rat e and the probability of incorre ctly identifying one of these good 
treatments as the most effective is 0.11. Under these simulatio ns, the worst arm wa s never incorrectly 
identified as the best, nor was  the best arm incorrectly identi fied as the worst.

Table 3 shows the mean sample size and the mean allocation to e ach of the three treatment arms for 
each of the response rate scenarios.  The proportion of the tot al sample size allocated to each arm is 
shown in parentheses.  The most  effective treatment arm(s) is s hown in bold‐italics.  Response adaptive 
allocation (RAR) tends to place  a higher proportion of patients  on the most effective treatment arm(s).  
In the scenarios where there is no difference between treatment  arms (Null, All Bad, All Really Bad) 
patients are evenly allocated.  In the case with one treatment  is 15% better than the other two, the 
Bayesian adaptive design tends t o stop early with an average of  484 patients. In oth er scenarios, where 
the drugs are ineffective (all bad or all really bad) or no dif ferent from one another, the trial tends to 
stop early with 400‐522 patients enrolled.  
In summary, the simulation resul ts show that the proposed desig n will have high power (90%) for the 
primary analysis, and the type  I error probability is well cont rolled (less than 0.05) under the complete 
null scenarios (Null, All Bad,  All Really Bad) and under most o ther treatment configurations considered. CONFIDENTIAL 
ESETT Trial Statistical Ana lysis Plan    Page 9 of 17 
(Version 1: Sept 2015) 
   Furthermore, the proposed method of RAR, randomizes more patien ts to the most effect therapy(‐ies) 
when there truly is a better treatment(s).  
9.4 FREQUENTIST ANALYSIS O F THE PRIMARY OUTCOME 
 
At the final analysis, the global null hypothesis 0:LVT VPA fPHT H  that the probabilities of success 
for all three treatment groups  are equal will be tested in a  chi‐squared  test with 2 degrees of freedom. 
If, and only if, the three‐way, g lobal null hypothesis is rejec ted, then all pairwise comparisons will be 
performed as a two‐sample test  of difference in proportions ( Z ‐ test).  
 
Each pairwise null hypothesis of superiority (0:LVT VPA H,  0:VPA fPHT H,   and 
0:LVT fPHT H) will be rejected if  the p‐value for the global null hypothesis is less than  0.01582, and 
the two‐sided p‐value for the two ‐sample test of proportions is  less than  0.01582. This approach uses a 
closed testing procedure to control the type I error rate at al pha under multiple comparisons.  Although 
the Frequentist tests will only o ccur once, we will use Pocock  stopping boundaries to control the overall 
alpha at 0.05. The corresponding Pocock stopping boundary would  be a Z‐value of ±2 .413 for 5 looks, 
which corresponds to a two‐ sided p‐value of 0.01582. 
 
Simulations have been conducted to demonstrate that the propose d Frequentist testing approach will 
control the type I error rate at  alpha 0.05 (two‐sided). Using  the exact data file that was simulated for 
the Bayesian design, which incorporates the possibility of earl y stopping, the Frequentist test procedure 
describe above was applied.    
Recall, the simulations of the Ba yesian adaptive design include d 1.) response‐adaptive randomization 
(RAR);  2) frequent interim asse ssments, 3) a Bayesian approach  to identify the most and or least 
effective treatment. Simulations  were performed assuming a maxi mum sample size of 720 (the 
uninflated maximum). The type I error rates are based on  100,000 simulations per scenario.   
 
As can be seen in Table 4, the familywise type I error rate is  less than 0.05 for all 4  scenarios considered 
(last column, bold italics ). The pairwise type I error rate s are underlined above (all <  0.01).  The 
remaining values in Table 4 that  are neither underlined nor bol ded represent the proportion of times 
the null hypothesis was correctly rejected.

10 MISSING DATA AND NON‐COMPLIANCE 
  
The primary analysis will be analy zed under the intent‐to‐treat  principle (ITT).  The ITT evaluable sample 
will include all subjects who are  randomized. In an ITT analysi s, missing data and study noncompliance 
can be problematic. Due to the short term endpoint, minimal mis sing data is expected for the primary 
outcome.  However, inability to administer the full dose of the  study drug or other protocol violations 
may occur which attenuate the tre atment effect. It is anticipat ed that a maximum of 2.5% of data will be 
missing or involve noncompliance/ protocol violations. Any missi ng values will be considered a treatment 
failure.  
  
11 SECONDARY AND EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY OUTCOME 
 
Secondary analyses of primary o utcome will include an analysis  of the adjudicated primary outcome, a 
re‐enroller analysis, a per prot ocol analysis, an analysis by a ge group. Due to the low amount of re‐
enrollers expected, the re‐enro ller analysis will treat repeate d assessments from the same individual as 
if they were independent (naive assumption). If the number of r e‐enrollers exceeds 10% of the total 
unique subjects enrolled, then a  generalized linear mixed model  (assuming the binomial distribution, 
logit link, random effect for s ubject) will be fit using the re peated assessments for re‐enrollers. CONFIDENTIAL 
ESETT Trial Statistical Ana lysis Plan    Page 11 of 17 
(Version 1: Sept 2015) 
   Exploratory analyses of the prim ary outcome will assess treatme nt differences adjusting for covariates 
(see section 12). Secondary and  exploratory analyses will not b e adjusted for multiple comparisons. 
 
To assess whether there is a change in the response rate over t ime due to changing perceptions 
amongst the investigators, we w ill fit a model with an autoregr essive correlation structure (time series) 
to assess whether the data may be  assumed to be i.i.d.  It is p ossible that the overa ll response rate may 
increase over time, due to investigators’ knowledge of the tria l design, repeated unblinding, and 
investigator bias in ascertaini ng a treatment response (later c ohorts are likely be enrolled to a winning 
treatment arm, thus response rat e is expected to be better for  later cohorts than at trial start).  
 
12 COVARIATE ADJUSTMENT 
 
The primary analysis will be una djusted for baseline covariates . Exploratory analyses of the primary 
outcome will assess treatment di fferences adjusting for etiolog y, time from seizure onset to 
randomization, age group, and we ight (>75 kg and <75kg). Clinic ally important differences due to 
gender, racial, or ethnic differences are not expected, but wil l be explored. Each co variate is evaluated 
individually first with a logistic regression model that includ es an interaction effect with the treatment. 
A multivariable logistic model t hat includes covariates that co ntributed significantly (p<0.05) or are 
treatment modifiers (interact with treatment group) individuall y may then be constructed. 
 
13 SITE EFFECTS 
 
Most of the differences expected by enrolling hub/site will be  due to the age groups of the patient 
populations (pediatric patients e nrolled at the PECARN site ver sus all ages enrolled at the NETT hubs). 
Although we do not anticipate significant hub/site effects, we  will investigate potential associations as a 
secondary analysis of the primary  outcome. A generalized linear  mixed model with log link function will 
be fit including treatment group, any covariates found to be si gnificant in section 12, and hub/site as a 
random effect (SAS PROC NLMIXED). 
 
14 PEDIATRIC SUBGROUP ANALYSIS  
 Etiology and clinical outcome of  status epilepticus are related  to age.  The etiology is mainly infectious in 
children and largely due to vascu lar events and tumors in those  older than 65 years. Fospheytoin 
induced hypotension is more common in those older than 65 years  of age. Moreover, mortality 
increases with age.   At each interim analysis, the interaction of age group and trea tment group will be tested using a logistic 
regression fit with treatment groups, age groups, and the inter action terms of treatment groups and age 
groups. If there is sufficient evidence that interaction effect s are present, defined as p‐value<0.05 for 
the overall test of interaction terms (a Wald 
2 test with 4 degrees of freedom), then the response 
adaptive randomization will be s topped and randomization will r evert to equal allocation until the end 
of the trial. Since there is no  prior evidence that an interact ion exists and given that the test for an 
interaction will be repeated at e ach interim analysis, the high er alpha‐level of 10% conventionally used 
for tests of interaction was reduced to 5%. At the end of the t rial, a secondary analysis of the primary 
outcome will be done by age group  (children, adult, and Seniors ). 
 
The models assessed in sections  12 and 13 will be repeated with  the pediatric subgroup. CONFIDENTIAL

15 SECONDARY OUTCOMES  
 
15.1 SECONDARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES  
 Secondary efficacy outcomes include: 
 time to termination of seizures 
 admission to ICU 
 length of ICU and hospital stays   
 
The time to termination of seizures is the interval from the st art of infusion of study  drug to cessation of 
clinically apparent seizure in t hose who meet the primary outco me. Hospital and ICU admission from the 
ED, and length of stay, is abstr acted from the hospital admissi on record. ICU admission is recorded as 
occurring only if the ICU is the initial inpatient unit for the  patient.  Length of stay is determined by the 
number of calendar days after t he day of ED arrival until hospi tal discharge or subject end‐of‐study. 
  
15.2 SAFETY OUTCOMES  
  
Primary safety outcome  is the absence of lif e threatening hypotension and cardiac arr hythmia within 60 
minutes of the start of study dr ug infusion. (See protocol for  definition of  life‐threatening hypotension  
and life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmia ).  
 
 
Other Safety Outcomes: 
 Life‐threatening hypotension 
 Life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmia 
 Mortality 
 Need for endotracheal intubation 
 Acute recurre nt seizure 
 Acute anaphylaxis 
 Respiratory depression 
 Hepatic transaminase or ammonia elevations 
 Purple glove syndrome 
 
 
Each Closed DSMB report will test for d ifferences in safety events i n treatment groups using a chi‐
squared test. Safety events will  also be reported by weight gro up (>75kg <75kg). Since there are multiple 
comparisons and multiple looks, the pre‐specified level of sign ificance is 0.01.  
 
 
15.3 ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY OUTCOMES 
 
At the final analysis, the seco ndary outcomes will be compared  by treatment group.  All secondary 
outcomes will be tested at a si gnificance level of two‐sided al pha of 0.05. Binary outcomes will be 
compared by first testing the nu ll hypothesis that the proporti on of responses for all three treatment 
groups are equal in a  2 test. If the three‐way null hypo thesis is rejected, then all p airwise comparisons CONFIDENTIAL 
ESETT Trial Statistical Ana lysis Plan    Page 13 of 17

   will be performed as two‐sample tests of proportions. Continuou s outcomes will be compared in an F‐
test to test the null hypothesis that all three treatment group s are equal, followed by pairwise t‐tests. 
The Richmond agitation and sedation score (RASS) at 60 minutes  will be compared by treatment groups 
in a Kruskal‐Wallis test.  The se condary outcomes will also be  compared by treatment group within age 
group. Kaplan Meier curves and lo g rank tests will be used to c ompare time to event outcomes by 
treatment group. Since mortality  is expected to increase by age , a cox proportional hazard model will be 
used to estimate the hazard rati o and 95% CI for the treatment  groups adjusting for  age groups and age 
by treatment interaction terms.  If the assumptions for the cox  proportional hazard model are not met, 
Kaplan Meier curves and log rank  tests will be used to compare  time to mortality by treatment group 
within each age group.   
 
15.4 SAFETY MONITORING 
    
Active monitoring for all advers e events (AEs) will occur throu ghout the study by the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) and as f urther described in the Safety  Monitoring Plan.

there is leeway in the number and timing of interim looks, this  design is planned to have fixed 
adaptations. However, it is possi ble that a planned adaptation  may be unacceptable. It may result in an 
allocation ratio that is determi nistic (e.g. all or nearly all  patients are randomized into a single arm). It 
may be in conflict with the safet y profile for a drug (either o verall or for a subgroup such as age or 
weight). Prior to implementing the updated allocation probabili ties, the DSMB/DSMB  Chair will be asked 
to review and a pprove them.

-  - ii Summary of Changes  
 
Version 2  Jan 2016  
 
Section 5.1 Edited language defining enrollment/randomization to be “defined as when study drug vial is 
connected to the patient’s IV and the pump is switched on”.  
 
Section 5.3 Clarified that the re -enroller sample includes “all enrollments of all patients” . 
 
Section 6 & 14 Children was defined as 2 -17 rather than <18.  Seniors was defined as “ 66 years and 
older ” rather than >65. The rationale was to clarify how age (a continuous numeric field) would be split.  
 
Section 9 The word “ non-compliance ” was changed to “cross -overs ”. This trial will not have  “non -
compliance” in the typical sense since patients are actively seizing while study drug is administered.  
 
Section 11 Added a sentence stating “Visual and exploratory analyses of the subset of pati ents who re -
enroll will be done as appropriate (Meurer 2015).”  
 
Section 12 moved the = sign to >=75 rather than <=75 kg . 
 
Section 16.2 and 16.3 scenarios were deleted and left to the discretion of the DSMB.  
 
Reference number 5 was added.  
 
Version 3 Jan 201 7 
 
Section 4. Added text under primary outcome to describe how the outcome is to be derived from the 
Case Report Form Data. “ The primary outcome is defined by Form501:Treatment Effect. A patient is a 
treatment failure if Q07=Yes or Q08=No or Q10=Yes. The e ntry for "date/time of the 60 minute 
assessment” reported in Q06 may not be exactly 60 minutes, but the responses to Q07 and Q08 are to 
be assumed to be implicitly referring to exactly 60 minutes (not the entry of the time of assessment). 
Thus, there is no  need to define “out of window” assessments based on Q06. ” 
 
Section 10 added sentences “ Safety analysis will include all enrollments of all subjects (including re -
enrollments). Subjects with missing /unknown  safety events will be  considered to have had the event.”  
 
Section 14 test of the interaction with age group will be for <18 versus >18 (not all 3 age groups) and the 
test is a DF=2 not 4. Added a sentence about an exploratory analysis of age as a continuous measure.  
 
Section 15.2 and 15.3 Updated binary test for secondary outcomes will be Fisher’s exact test if 
frequencies are too small for Chi- squared test.

2 OVERVIEW OF THE STU DY DESIGN  
  
This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, response -adaptive, comparative effectiveness trial of three 
active treatments in patients with  established status epilepticus (E SE) who have failed benzodiazepines. 
The primary objective is to determi ne the most effective and/or the least effective treatment of 
established  status epilepticus  (ESE) among patients older than 2 years.  There are three active treatment 
arms being compared: fosphenytoin (FOS), levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA). S ubjects will 
initially be randomized equally to all three treatments (1:1:1 ratio ). Once 300 subjects are enrolled, 
response -adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of maximizing the likelihood of 
identifying the most effective treatmen t arm.  Interim analyses are planned after 400, 500, 600 and 700 
patients are enrolled.  At each interim analysis, there may be updates to the randomization 
probabilities. At each interim analysis, the trial may stop early for success or futility. The maxi mum 
sample size is 795 patients total.

 3 SCHEMATIC OF DESIGN  
 
 
4 PRIMARY OUTCOME  
 
The primary outcome is clinical cessation of status epilepticus, determined by the absence of clinically 
apparent seizures and improving responsiveness, at 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion, 
without the use of additional anti -seizure medication. A patient is considered a treatment success if they 
meet the definition of the primary outcome as defined above.  
 
The primary outcome is defined by Form5 01:Treatment Effect. A patient is a treatment failure if 
Q07=Yes or Q08=No or Q10=Yes. The entry for " date/time of the 60 minute assessment ” reported in 
Q06 may not be exactly 60 minutes, but the responses to Q07 and Q08 are to be assumed to be 
implicitly referring to exactly 60 minutes (not the  entry of  the time of assessment). Thus, there is no 
need to define “out of window” assessments based on Q06.

5 ANALYSIS SAMPLES  
 
5.1 ITT SAMPLE  
The intent- to-treat sample (ITT) includes all unique patients who are randomized , regardless of amount 
of treatment actually received. Patients who are  known to have been  enrolled more than once  (re-
enrollers) will have only their first enrollment included.  Patients are counted as being a part of the 
treatment group to which  they were given at the time of enrollment/ randomiz ation ( defined as when 
study drug vial is connected to the patient’s IV and the pump is switched on ). The primary analysis will 
use the ITT sample.  
 
5.2 PER-PROTOCOL SAMPLE  
 
The per-protocol sample includes  all patients who meet the study inclusion criteria and who received at 
least 80% of the  study drug to which they were randomized.   Secondary analyses of the primary 
outcome will use the per -protocol sample.  
 
 
5.3 RE-ENROLLERS SAMPLE 
 
It is anticipated that a maximum of 5% of subjects will be re -enrolled. The re-enrollers sample includes 
all enrollments of all patient s.  Patients who are enrolled more than once will have each enrollment 
included in this sample.  Analyses of safety outcomes will use the re -enrol lers sample.  
  
6 RANDOMIZATION  
 
The objective of randomization is to prevent possible selection bias by providing random treatment 
assignment to each subject. Throughout the trial, randomization will be stratified by three age groups 
(2-17 years, 18-65 years, and 66 years and older). To ensure similar randomization probabilities across 
the three age groups while incorporating adaptive randomization, we will use a “Step Forward” 
centralized randomization procedure developed for emergency treatment trials.2 
 
The randomization scheme will be equal allocation (1:1:1) for the first 300 patients. Once 300 subjects 
are enrolled, response -adaptive randomization (RAR) will be utilized with the goal of maximizing the 
likelihood of identifying the most effective treatment arm  using information weighting (Connor 2013) .  
Information is a measure of the expected reduction in variance from adding an additional patient to 
treatment arm  t and is defined for treatment arm,  t, as It = (pt Var(θt)/(nt + 1))1/2  where  pt is the 
probability treatment  t provides the highest success rate , θt is the success rate, and  nt is the number of 
patients randomized to treatment t .   It is calculated for all three treatment arms, and the values are 
rescaled to produce randomization prob abilities , rt  for therapy  t, for the next 100 patients  as rt = It / 
Σ(It) that sum to 1 .  The result is that better treatments are favored, but if at an interim analysis two 
arms are equally effective, the arm with fewer patients randomized to it will have a larger 
randomization probability for the next set of patients.  The target allocation ratio will be updated every 
100 patients .  
 
7 PRIMARY ANALYSIS  CONFIDENTIAL  
ESETT  Trial Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 5 of 20 
(Version 4: May 2018 ) 
 This trial will be considered a success if the posterior probability that a treatment is the most effective is 
greater than 0.975 or the posterior probability that a treatment is the least effective is greater than 
0.975. The posterior probabilities that e ach treatment is the most and least effective treatment will be 
calculated using Bayesian methods based on a uniform beta prior for each treatment’s success rate, and 
a conjugate beta -binomial model1. At the conclusion of the trial, we will report the response rate for 
each treatment group with 95% credible intervals as well as the pairwise differences in response rates 
with 95% credible intervals.    
 
Each of the three treatment arms is modeled independently.  We assume the probability of success, θT, 
has a prior distribution, [ θT] ~ Beta(1,1)  for T ∈ {FOS, LEV, VPA}.  We assume the number of 
observed successes on each treatment,  XT, among the currently enrolled patients on treatment T , NT, 
follows a binomial distribution .  We will update the prior distribution with the observed data. The 
posterior distribution for each treatment arm will therefore be  [θT |X T, N T] ~ Beta(1+X T, 1+NT -XT). 
The resulting posterior distribution is used to calculate the probability that each treatment is the most 
effective and the probability that each treatment is the least effective ( tmax and tmin, respectively) . The 
probability treatment T is the best treatment, Pr(T = tmax) = Pr(θT > θX and θT > θY) where X and Y 
represent the two treatments other than treatmen t T.  Likewise, the probability treatment T  is the least 
effective treatment, Pr(T = t min) = Pr(θT < θX and θT < θY).   
 
The joint posterior for the three response rates is  
 
 
 
The posterior probability  θLVT is the highest response rate is  
 
Pr(𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 =𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚)=Pr((𝜃𝜃𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿>𝜃𝜃𝐿𝐿𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉)& (𝜃𝜃𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 >𝜃𝜃𝑓𝑓𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓𝐿𝐿))

The posterior probability  θLVT is the lowest response rate is 
 
Pr(𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 =𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚)=Pr((𝜃𝜃𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿<𝜃𝜃𝐿𝐿𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉)& (𝜃𝜃𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿<𝜃𝜃𝑓𝑓𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓𝐿𝐿))

These are similarly specified  for VPA and fP HT. This trial will be considered a success if Pr(T=tmax) > 
0.975 and/or Pr( T’=tmin) > 0.975 for any treatments T  and T’.  This represents that the trial has 
identified the best or worst treatment with high probability. Model details have been published1. 
 
 
8 INTERIM ANALYSIS  
 
Interim monitoring for success and futility will begin after 400 patients have been enrolled and will be 
repeated after every additional 100 patients are enrolled. Thus, interim analyses will be performed after 
CONFIDENTIAL  
ESETT  Trial Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 6 of 20 
(Version 4: May 2018 ) 
 400, 500, 600, and 700 pa tients. This trial will stop early for success if we have identified the maximum 
effective treatment with at least 97.5% probability.  
 
There are two early futility criteria.  The first futility rule will stop the trial early if all treatment arms 
have a clinically unacceptable response rate. This trial may stop early for futility if there is a low 
probability, less than 5%, that any of th e three treatment arms is achieving a response rate of at least 
25%.   The second futility rule will stop the trial early if all treatments are performing similarly and we 
will be unable to identify a most effective or least effective treatment. This trial will stop early for futility 
if the predictive probability of identifying either the most effective or the least effective treatment at 
the maximum sample size is less than 5%. The predictive probability  rules for monitoring pediatric 
population  will assume a maximum of N=350 children  enrollments . 
 
All interim analysis results will be considered confidential and only presented to the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board in a formal report prepared by the  paritally  unblinded statistical team at the St atistical 
and Data Management Center ( SDMC ).  Following review of both the interim analysis results and safety 
data, the DSMB will make a recommendation regarding the above decisions.  
 
9 GENERAL SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 
This study will enroll a maximum total sample size of 795 patients over 4 years, at an accrual rate of 
approximately 16.5 patients per month. A maximum sample size of 795 provides 90% power to identify 
the most effective treatment when one treatment arm ha s a true response rate of 65% and the true 
response rate is 50% in the other two arms (an absolute difference of 15%). The trial operating 
characteristics were determined via an extensive simulation study . The statistical and full simulation 
details as well as the operating characteristics of the design are provided in Appendix  and have been 
published1.  
 
The expected response rates for FOS, LEV and VPA are based on the retrospective analysis of 279 
episodes of ESE in adults, who were treated with PHT, LEV or VPA3.  The study reported 59.6% of patient 
episodes responded to  FOS,  51.7% to LEV and  74.6% to VPA . Based on this study and expert evaluation 
of all currently published data on the treatment of ESE, we expect that the worst drug will be effective in 
50% of the patients. A  15% difference  is the minimum clinically important difference sufficient to change 
clinical practice.  
 
The total sample size for this trial corresponds to the sample size that would be needed for a frequentist 
analysis. A sample size of 209/group (627 total) is needed for a χ2 test with 2 degrees of freedom of the 
overall test of equality of the three propo rtions with 90% power (assuming the smallest proportion is 
0.50 and the largest proportion is 0.65 and the average proportion is 0.55, two -sided alpha 0.05). For a 
two-sample test of proportions (all pairwise comparisons of treatment groups), with equal allocation 
into each treatment group, when one treatment proportion is 0.50 and the other treatment proportion 
is 0.65, the sample size needed is 240 per group to detect an absolute treatment difference as small as 
0.15 with 90% power (assuming two -sided alp ha 0.05 and interim looks). Thus, a total sample size of 
240*3groups=720 (uninflated for re -enrollers, missing data). Given the possibility of re -enrollers, 
protocol violations, and missing data, the maximum sample size was inflated from 720 up to 795  by CONFIDENTIAL  
ESETT  Trial Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 7 of 20 
(Version 4: May 2018 ) 
 N`=720*R where R=(1/(1 -.025)^2)*1.05. The sample size was inflated in two ways4. First, for the re -
enrollers (expected to be 5%) who will be excluded from the analysis. Secondly,  it was inflated  to 
account for the impact of treatment cross -overs, protocol violations, and missing data on the ITT 
analysis (expected to occur 2.5% of the time). In order to determine the operating characteristics for this 
Bayesian adaptive design, simulations were performed assuming a maximum sample size of 720 (the 
uninflated m aximum) and considering different response rate scenarios.  
 
 
 
 
9.1 SIMULATION DETAILS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Simulations of the proposed design included 1.) response -adaptive randomization (RAR);  2) frequent 
interim assessments, 3) a Bayesian approach to identify the most and or least effective treatment.  Table 
1 shows the response rate scenarios considered in the simulations. To evaluate how the design 
performs, we simulated the trial (including the response adaptive randomization and interim analysis) 
considering different success rat e scenarios. The operating characteristics are based on 100,000 
simulations per scenario. All simulations were programmed in R. Complete details are provided in 
Appendix . These scenarios illustrate a difference of 7.5% and 15% between drugs.  
 
Table 2 show the trial’s operating characteristics for these response rate scenarios including the 
probability of identifying the most effective treatment ( tmax) and the probability of identifying the least 
effective treatment ( tmin) and the overall probability of trial success (last column).

9.2 POWER  
The power or the true positive rate of this trial is the probability of identifying the most effective 
treatment when one truly exists and/or probability of identifying the least effective treatment when one 
truly exists. Table 2 shows the power for 3 scen arios in bold font .   In the “One Good” scenario, one 
treatment arm has a 65% response rate compared to a 50% response rate in the other two arms.  The 
power to correctly identify the most effective treatment is 90%.  In the “Two Good” scenario, one arm is  
ineffective (50% response rate) relative to the other two (65% response rate) and the probability of 
correctly identifying a least effective treatment is 69%.  In the “One Middle One Good” scenario, there is 
a modest treatment effect in one arm and a stro ng treatment effect in another arm.  The power to 
correctly identify either a most or a least effective treatment (or both) is 68%.  The power to identify the 
best treatment in the One Good and One Middle One Good scenarios exceed the power for the same 
design with fixed randomization (90% vs. 87% and 49% vs. 45%, respectively).1  
 
9.3 TYPE I ERROR PROBABI LITY 
The type I error probability (false positive rate) of this trial is the probability of incorrectly identifying a 
most effective treatment and/or incorrec tly identifying a least effective treatment. Under simulation, 
this is determined as the number of trials that incorrectly identify tmax and/or  tmin. Table 2 underlines  the 
type I errors. In the “Null” scenario where all treatment arms have the same 50% re sponse rate, the 
probability of incorrectly identifying a maximum effective treatment is 0.017 and the probability of 
incorrectly identifying a least effective treatment is 0.021.  The “familywise” type I error probability is 
well controlled (less than 0.0 5) under the complete null configurations: 0.037 for the “Null” scenario, 
0.036 for the “All Bad” scenario, and 0.005 for the “All Really Bad” scenario (Table 2 last column). In the 
“One Good” scenario, the overall type I error probability is 0.04 and unde r the “One Middle One Good” 
scenario, the overall type I error probability is 0.000. In the “Two Good” scenario, two of the treatment 
arms have the same response rate and the probability of incorrectly identifying one of these good 
treatments as the most effective is 0.11. Under these simulations, the worst arm was never incorrectly 
identified as the best, nor was the best arm incorrectly identified as the worst.

 shown in parentheses.  The most effective treatment ar m(s) is shown in bold -italics.  Response adaptive 
allocation (RAR) tends to place a higher proportion of patients on the most effective treatment arm(s).  
In the scenarios where there is no difference between treatment arms (Null, All Bad, All Really Bad) 
patients are evenly allocated.  In the case with one treatment is 15% better than the other two, the 
Bayesian adaptive design tends to stop early with an average of 48 4 patients.  In other scenarios, where 
the drugs are ineffective (all bad or all really bad) or no different from one another, the trial tends to 
stop early with 400 -522 patients enrolled.  
In summary, the simulation results show that the proposed design will have high power (90%) for the 
primary analysis, and the type I error probability is we ll controlled (less than 0.05) under the complete 
null scenarios (Null, All Bad, All Really Bad) and under most other treatment configurations considered. 
Furthermore, the proposed method of RAR, randomizes more patients to the most effect therapy( -ies) 
when there truly is a better treatment(s).  
9.4 FREQUENTIST ANALYSIS  OF THE PRIMARY OUTC OME  
 
At the final analysis , the global  null hypothesis  0:LVT VPA fPHT Hθθθ= =  that the p robabilities  of success 
for all three treatment groups are equal will be tested in a chi -squared test with 2 degrees of freedom . 
If, and only if,  the three -way, global  null hypothesis is rejected, then all pairwise comparisons  will be 
performed as a two -sample test of difference in proportions  (Z - test) .  
 
Each pairwise null hypothesis  of superiority  (0:LVT VPA Hθθ= ,  0:VPA fPHT Hθθ= ,   and 
0:LVT fPHT Hθθ= ) will be rejected if the p-value for the global null hypothesis is less than 0.01582,  and 
the two-sided p-value for the two-sample test of proportions  is less than 0.01582. This approach uses a 
closed testing procedure to control the type I error rate at alpha  under multiple comparisons . Although 
the Frequentist tests will only occur once, we will use Pocock stopping bounda ries to control the overall 
alpha  at 0.05. The corresponding Pocock stopping boundary would be a Z -value of ±2.413 for 5 looks, 
which corresponds to a two -sided p -value of 0.01582.  
 
Simulations have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed Frequentist testing approach will 
control the type I error rate at alpha 0.05 (two -sided). Using the exact data file that was simulated for 
the Bayesian design, which incorporates the possibi lity of early stopping, the Frequentist test procedure 
describe above was applied.   
 
Recall, the simulations of the Bayesian adaptive design included 1.) response -adaptive randomization 
(RAR);  2) frequent interim assessments, 3) a Bayesian approach to identify the most and or least 
effective treatment.  Simulations were performed assuming a maximum sample size of 720 (the 
uninflated maximum). The type I error rates are based on 100,000  simulations per scenario.    
 
As can be seen in Table 4, the familywis e type I error rate is less than 0.05 for all 4 scenarios considered 
(last column, bold italics ). The pairwise type I error rates are underlined  above (all <  0.01).  The 
remaining values in Table 4 that are neither underlined nor bolded represent the propo rtion of times 
the null hypothesis was correctly rejected.

10 MISSING DATA AND NON- COMPLIANCE  
  
The primary analysis will be analyzed under the intent -to-treat principle (ITT).  The ITT evaluable sample 
will include all subjects who are randomized. In an ITT analysis, missing data and study noncompliance 
can be problematic. Due to the short term endpoint, minimal missing data is expected for the primary 
outcome.  However, inability to adm inister the full dose of the study drug or other protocol violations 
may occur which attenuate the treatment effect. It is anticipated that a maximum of 2.5% of data will be 
missing or involve noncompliance/protocol violations. Any missing values  for the p rimary outcome  will 
be considered a treatment failure.  Safety analysis will include all enrollments of all subjects (including 
re-enrollments). Subjects with m issing /unknown  safety events  will be  considered to have had the event.  
 
11 SECONDARY AND EXPLORATOR Y ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY OUTCOME  
 
Secondary analyses of primary outcome will include an analysis of the adjudicated primary outcome, a 
re-enroller analysis, a per protocol analysis, an analysis by age  group . Due to the low amount of re -
enrollers expected,  the re -enroller analysis will treat repeated assessments from the same individual as 
if they were independent (naive assumption).  If the number of re -enrollers exceeds 10% of the total 
unique subjects enrolled,  then a generalized linear mixed model (assuming the binomial distribution, 
logit link, random effect for subject) will be fit using the repeated assessments for re -enrollers.  Visual 
and exploratory analyse s of the subset of patients who re -enroll will be done as appropriate ( Meurer CONFIDENTIAL  
ESETT  Trial Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 11 of 20 
(Version 4: May 2018 ) 
 2015). Exploratory analyses of the primary outcome will assess treatment differences adjusting for 
covariates (see section 12) . Secondary and exploratory analyses will not be adjusted for multiple 
comparisons.  
 
To assess whether  there is a change in the response rate over time due to changing perceptions 
amongst the investigators, we will fit a model with an  autoregressive correlation structure (time series ) 
to assess whether the data may be assumed to be i .i.d.  It is possible that the overall response rate may 
increase over time, due to investigators’ knowledge of the trial design, repeated unblinding, and 
investigator bias in ascertaining a treatment response (later cohorts are likely be enrolled to a winning  
treatment arm, thus response rate is expected to be better for later cohorts than at trial start) .  
 
12 COVARIATE ADJUSTMENT  
 
The primary analysis will be unadjusted for baseline covariates . Exploratory analyses of the primary 
outcome will assess treatment d ifferences adjusting for etiology , time from seizure onset to 
randomization,  age group , and weight ( < 75kg  or >75 kg ). Clinically important differences due to gender, 
racial, or ethnic differences are not expected, but will be explored. Each covariate is evaluated 
individually first with a logistic regression model that includes an interaction effect with the treatment. 
A multivariable logistic model that includes covariates  that contributed significantly (p<0.05) or are 
treatment modifiers  (interact with treatment group)  individually may then be constructed.  
 
13 SITE EFFECTS  
 
Most of the differences expected by enrolling hub/site will be due to the age groups of the patient 
populations (pediatric patients enrolled at the PECARN site versus all ages enrolled at the NETT hubs). 
Although we do not anticipate significant hub/site effects, we will investigate potential associations as a 
secondary analysis of the primary outcome. A generalized linear mixed model with log link function will 
be fit  including treatment  group, any covariates found to be significant in section 12 , and hub/site as a 
random effect ( SAS PROC NLMIXED) . 
 
14 PEDIATRIC SUBGROUP ANALYSIS  
 
Etiology and clinical outcome of status epilepticus are related to age.  The etiology is mainly infectious in 
children and largely due to vascular events and tumors in those older than 65 years. Fosphe nytoin 
induced hypotension is more common in those olde r than 65 years of age. Moreover, mortality 
increases with age.  
 
At each interim analysis, the interaction of age group  (<18 versus > 18) and treatment group will be 
tested using a logistic regression fit with treatment groups, age group, and the interacti on terms of 
treatment groups and age group . If there is sufficient evidence that interaction effects are present, 
defined as p -value<0.05 for the overall test of interaction terms (a Wald χ2 test with 2 degrees of 
freedom) , then the response adaptive rando mization will be stopped and randomization will revert to 
equal allocation until the end of the trial. Since there is no prior evidence that an interaction exists  and 
given that the test for an interaction will be repeated at each interim analysis, the higher alpha -level of 
10% conventionally used for tests of interaction was reduced to 5%. At the end of the trial, a secondary 
analysis of the primary outcome will be done by age group ( 2-17 years, 18 -65 years, and 66 and older ).  
Exploratory analyses will consider the effect of age as a continuous measure as well as cutpoints.  CONFIDENTIAL  
ESETT  Trial Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 12 of 20 
(Version 4: May 2018 ) 
  
The models assessed in sections 12 and 13 will be repeated with the pediatric subgroup.  
 
15 SECONDARY OUTCOMES  
 
15.1 SECONDARY EFFICACY O UTCOMES  
 
Seco ndary efficacy outcomes include:  
• time to termination of seizures  
• admission to ICU  
• length of ICU and hospital stays    
 
The time to termination of seizures is the interval from the start of infusion of study drug to cessation of 
clinically apparent seizure in thos e who meet the primary outcome. Hospital and ICU admission from the 
ED, and length of stay, is abstracted from the hospital admission record. ICU admission is recorded as 
occurring only if the ICU is the initial inpatient unit for the patient.  Length of s tay is determined by the 
number of calendar days after the day of ED arrival until hospital discharge or subject end -of-study.  
 
 
15.2 SAFETY OUTCOMES  
  
Primary safety outcome  is the absence of life threatening hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia within 60 
minutes of the start of study drug infusion. (See protocol for definition of life-threatening hypotension 
and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia ).  
 
 
Other Safety Outcomes:  
• Life-threatening hypotension  
• Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia  
• Mortality  
• Need for endotracheal intubation  
• Acute recurrent seizure  
• Acute anaphylaxis  
• Respiratory depression  
• Hepatic transaminase or ammonia elevations  
• Purple glove syndrome  
 
 
Each Closed DSMB  report will test for differences  in safety events in treatment groups using a chi -
squared test  or Fisher’s exact test.  Safety events will also be reported by weight group (< 75kg or >75 
kg). Since there are multiple comparisons and multiple looks, the pre -specified level of significance is 
0.01.  
 
 
15.3 ANALYSIS OF SECONDA RY OUTCOMES  
 CONFIDENTIAL  
ESETT  Trial Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 13 of 20 
(Version 4: May 2018 ) 
 At the final analysis, t he secondary outcomes will be compared by treatment group.  All secondary 
outcomes will be tested at a significance level of two -sided alpha of 0.05. Binary outcomes will be 
compared by first testing the null hypothesis that the proportion of responses for all three treatment 
groups are equal in a χ2 test (or Fisher’s exact test depending on frequency of events) . If the three -way 
null hypothesis is rejected, then all pairwise comparisons will be performed as two -sample tests of 
proportions. Continuous outcomes will be compared in an F -test (or Kruskal- Wall is test  if normality 
assumption is violated)  to test the null hypothesis that all three treatment groups are equal, followed by 
pairwise t -tests  (or Wilcoxon Rank sum test) . The Richmond agitation and sedation score (RASS) at 60 
minutes will be compared by  treatment groups in a Kruskal -Wallis test.  T he secondary outcomes will 
also be compared by treatment group within age group. Kaplan Meier curves and log rank tests will be 
used to compare time to event outcomes by treatment group. Since mortality is expected to increase by 
age, a cox proportional hazard model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% CI for the 
treatment groups adjusting for age groups and age by treatment interaction terms.  If the assumptions 
for the cox proportional hazard model are not met, Kaplan Meier curves and log rank tests will be used 
to compare time to mortality by treatment group within each age group.   
 
15.4 SAFETY MONITORING  
   
Active monitoring for all adverse events (AEs) will occur throughout the study  by the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB)  and as further described in the Safety Monitoring Plan.

16.2 TARGET RANDOMIZATION  UPDATES  
 
The target randomization  probabilities will be updated based on the primary efficacy outcome ( section 
4) using the methodology described under section 6.  
 
The trial operating characteristics (power and type I error rate) are dependent on carefully following the 
pre-specified timing of randomization updates and the early stopping rules.   Unlike some trials in which 
there is leeway in the number and timing of interim looks, this design is planned to have fixed 
adaptations. Prior to implement ing the updated allocation probabilities, the DSMB/DSMB Chair will be 
asked to review and  approve them.

1.0	Background 	
	
This is a Phase III comparative effectiveness trial in patients  with established 
status epilepticus who have failed benzodiazepines.  The primar y objective is to 
determine the most effective and /or the least effective treatme nt.  The primary 
efficacy outcome for the study i s clinical cessation of status epilepticus 
sustained for 60 minutes from the  start of study drug infusion,  without further 
intervention with anti-seizure or sedative medications. .  Ther e are three active 
treatment arms, fosphenytoin (fP HT), levetiracetam (LVT), and v alproic acid 
(VPA).  Adaptive randomization will be used to allocate patient s to the three 
treatment arms. This trial will be monitored for early success and futility.  The 
ESETT trial plans to enroll a ma ximum of 795 patients. However,  the operating 
characteristics reported in this document were determined assum ing a 
maximum sample size of 720 (uninf lated for re-enrollers, missin g data, and 
protocol violations).   
	
2.0	Statistical 	Modeling 		
2.1	Primary	Endpoint 	
	
Each of the three treatment arms  is modeled independently.  We assume the 
probability of success, T, has a Beta prior distribution  
[T] ~ Beta(1,1) 
for T  {fPHT, LVT, VPA}. 
This prior distribution is equiv alent to observing two patients ’ worth of information 
where one experienced a success and one did not.  At each inter im analysis the 
number of observed successes on each treatment, XT, among the currently enrolled 
patients on treatment T, NT, follows a binomial distribution 
[XT] ~ Binomial( NT, T). 
We update the prior distribution  with the currently observed da ta for each 
treatment arm ( XT,	NT) and the resulting posterior distribution on each arm is 
[T	|XT,	NT] ~ Beta(1+ XT, 1+NT‐XT).  
ESETT 
 2From each posterior we will also  calculate the probability that  each treatment offers 
the best and worst treatment eff ect.  The treatment offering th e best treatment 
effect is labeled tmax	while the treatment offering the worst treatment effect is 
labeled tmin.  Of course during the trial it will not be know which treatme nt is t max 
and which is tmax, however we can apply probabilities that each of the three 
treatments is t max and t min. 
The probability treatment T is the best treatment, Pr( T = tmax) = Pr(T > X and T > 
Y) where X and Y represent the two treatme nts other than treatment T.  Likewise, 
the probability treatment T is the least effective treatment, Pr( T = tmin) = Pr(T	< X 
and T < Y) where X and Y represent the two treatment s that are not treatment T. 
This model will be used at each interim analysis and the final analysis. 
 2.2	Primary	Efficacy	Analysis		
	
At the conclusion of the trial, we will report the response rat es for each treatment 
group with 95% credible interval s as well as the pairwise diffe rences in response 
rates with 95% credible intervals. 
 
In addition, we will calculate an d report the posterior probabi lities that each 
treatment, T,	is the most and least effective treatment, Pr( T=t
max) and Pr( T=tmin).  
This trial will be considered a success if Pr( T=tmax) > 0.975 and/or Pr( T’=tmin) > 
0.975 for any treatments T and T’.  This represents that the trial has identified the 
best or worst treatment with high probability.  
 
3.0		Possible 	Adaptations 	
	
Interim analysis will occur af ter 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 pa tients are enrolled 
(assuming the trial has not sto pped before such time points). 
 
At each interim analysis there m ay be updates to the randomizat ion probabilities (at 
or beyond 300 patients) and/or the  trial may stop early for suc cess (at or beyond 
400 patients) or futility (at or beyond 400 patients). 
	
3.1	Adaptive	Allocation 	
	
The initial 300 patients will be randomized equally to the thre e treatment arms.  
Thus, 100 patients will be alloca ted to each arm.  After the in itial 300 patients, 
adaptive randomization will begi n. Adaptive randomization will focus on identifying 
the treatment arm offering the h ighest response rate, labeled tmax, by using 
information weighting.  It is unknown during the trial which ar m is truly tmax, the 
treatment offering the highest true response rate.  Therefore, throughout the trial 
we assign probabilities, based on  the ever-accumulating data, t hat each treatment is 
tmax.    
ESETT 
 3 
We use this measure, along with the information on each arm to update 
randomization probabilities using  information-weighted adaptive  randomization.  
Information is a measure of the expected reduction in variance from adding an 
additional patient and is defined for treatment arm, T, as  
 
ITPrTtmax VarT
nT1 
 
	
where Pr( T=tmax)  is the probability that treatment t	is the maximum effective 
treatment tmax,  Var(T) is the posterior variance of the response rate,  and nT	is the 
current number of patients  allocated to treatment T.    Once IT is calculated for all 
three treatment arms, the values are rescaled so the probabilit ies sum to 1. 
Therefore the randomization probability, rT,  to treatment T is  
 
rTIT
It
t13
. 
 
If the adaptive randomization probability for an arm is less th an 5%, this probability 
is set to zero and the remaining  arms receive proportionally in creased probability. 
In this manner, arms are effectiv ely dropped, but may be re-int roduced if the 
adaptive randomization probabili ty increases at subsequent inte rim analyses. 
Adaptive randomization probabili ties will be updated starting w hen 300 patients 
are enrolled and after every addi tional 100 patients are enroll ed.   
 
Allocation to the treatment arms  will be stratified by age grou p (2-16 years, 16-65 
years, and greater than 65 years). We will use a “Step Forward”  randomization 
procedure, as described in Zhao et al (2010).  This algorithm r equires a target 
randomization proportion for eac h treatment arm.  This target p roportion will be 
equal allocation for the first 300 patients (1/3 to each arm) a nd will be updated 
according to the adaptive alloca tion probabilities when 300 pat ients have been 
enrolled and after every addition al 100 patients have been enro lled.   
	
3.2	Interim	Monitoring 	for	Success	
 
Interim monitoring for success will begin after 400 patients ha ve been enrolled and 
will be repeated after every addi tional 100 patients are enroll ed.  Interim 
monitoring is based on the treat ment identified as the maximum effective treatment 
(tmax).  This trial will stop early f or success if we have identifie d the maximum 
effective treatment with at least 97.5% probability, that is if  any arm T  {fPHT, LVT, 
VPA} offers  
ESETT 
 4 
  P r ( T = tmax) ≥  0.975. 
 
3.4	Interim	Monitoring 	for	Futility	
	
Interim monitoring for futilit y will begin after 400 patients h ave been enrolled and 
will be repeated after every addi tional 100 patients are enroll ed.  There are two 
early futility criteria.  The fir st futility rule will stop the  trial early if all treatment 
arms have clinically unacceptab le success rates.   The second f utility rule will stop 
the trial early if all treatments are performing similarly and we will be unable to 
identify a most effective or least effective treatment.  
 
First, any treatment arm will be  terminally dropped if its resp onse rate is clearly 
less than 25%: 
 
Pr(T	≥ 25%) < 0.05. 
 
Therefore the trial will stop early if there is a low probabili ty that any of the three 
treatment arms is achieving a success rate of at least 25%.  If  all three of the 
following conditions are met, t he trial stops for futility: 
 
Pr(fPHT	≥ 25%) < 0.05 
 Pr(LVT	≥ 25%) < 0.05 
Pr(VPA	≥ 25%) < 0.05. 
 
The second futility stopping cri teria applies if the trial is u nlikely to achieve its 
primary objective, to identify the most effective and/or the le ast effective treatment. 
This trial will stop early for f utility if the predictive proba bility of identifying either 
the most effective ( tmax) or the least effective treatment ( tmin) is less than 5%.  
 
This calculation proceeds as follows.   
1. For an interim analysis at N patients we have posterior probability 
distributions for each treatment  arm as described in Section 2. 0.   
2. Assuming that the randomiz ation for the rest of 720 – N patients will proceed 
with the current randomization p robabilities, the number of pat ients to be 
randomized to each of the three treatment groups is MT		=	rT (720 – N). 
3.  The number of predicted successes, s T on each arm therefore has a Beta-
Binomial distribution s T ~ Beta-binomial( MT, 1+XT, 1+NT‐XT).  So every 
possible resulting number of successes on each arm, XT+ST = XT, XT+1,…, XT+MT 
is assigned a probability. 
4. There ( MfPHT	+ 1) × ( MLVT	+ 1)× ( MVPA	+ 1) possible trial outcomes. For each 
possible set of final trial data, X fPHT+SfPHT / N fPHT+M fPHT,   X LVT+SLVT / 
NLVT+M LVT, XVPA+SVPA / N VPA+M VPA,  we calculate the probability of each 
observed triplet and whether that result, using the methods in Section 2.2, 
would result in identifying a be st or worst treatment with 97.5 % probability.    
ESETT 
 55. We sum the probabilities for whi ch a best and/or worst treatmen t would be 
identified.  This sum represents the predicted probability of t rial success at 
the maximum sample size.  If this sum is < 5%, the trial stops for futility.  This 
case would occur when all three treatment are performing very s imilarly and 
it is unlikely that acquiring fu rther data would identify a bes t or worst 
treatment. 
	
4.0	Example 	Trials	
	
The tables below show two exampl e trials in order to better und erstand the 
adaptive trial. 
 
Example	1	
 
First we see a trial that stops early for success after 600 pat ients are enrolled.  At the 
first interim analysis when 300 patients are enrolled we see su ccess rates of 51% 
for fPHT, 55% for LVT and 64% for VPA. At this interim analysis  there is a 88% 
chance VPA offers the best treatm ent effect and a 70% chance fP HT offers the worst 
treatment effect.  The randomiza tion probabiliti es for the next  100 patients are 
calculated to be 12%, 22% and 66%  to fPHT, LVT, and VPA, respec tively.

We in fact see 11, 26, and 63 pati ents randomized to fPHT, LVT,  and VPA, 
respectively and LVT having th e highest success rate with 19/26  (73%) of the new 
patients randomized to it bein g successes.  So at the 400-patie nt analysis we see 
success rates of 51%, 59%, and 64%, fPHT, LVT, and VPA, respect ively.  The 
observed benefit of VPA over LVT  decreases from 64% vs. 55% at the first analysis 
to 64% vs. 59% now, however this  smaller benefit it is based on  more data.  The 
probability that VPA is the best  treatment (offering the highes t response rate) 
decreases slightly from 88% to 83%.  We also see a higher rando mization  
ESETT 
 6probability to LVT in the next se t of patients.  The predictive  probability of trial 
success (the probability of identi fying a best or worst treatme nt at the maximum 
sample size) is 0.50, well about the 5% threshold to stop for f utility.  Therefore the 
trial continues with another interim analysis after 500 patient s are enrolled. 
 
VPA again had the best respons e rate in the next 100 patients ( 68% vs. 42% for 
fPHT and 53% for LVT).  The proba bility that VPA offers the bes t treatment effect is 
94%, high but not exceeding the 9 7.5% we need to stop the trial  early for success. 
 
Therefore we enroll another 100 patients, 69% to VPA, 23% to LV T, and 8% to 
fPHT.  At the 600-patient analysis  after these patients are enr olled we see that VPA 
has a 99.2% chance of offering th e best treatment effect.  As t his exceeds 97.5% the 
trial is stopped early and the r esults reported with VPA offeri ng the superior 
response rate.   At that time we  also see fPHT has an 87% chanc e of having the 
lowest response rate. 
 
Final summaries will also include  95% confidence intervals for the response rates 
on each arm and for the pairwise differences. 
 
Example	2	
	
Example 2 illustrates a case whe re the trial stops early for fu tility.   
 
After the 300-patient analysis fPHT is looking better with a re sponse rate of 54% vs. 
48% for LVT and just 42% for VPA.   The predictive probability c alculation shows a 
48% chance that this trial will identify either a best or worst  treatment, though the 
trial could not stop at 300 patients.

The trial continues and the majo rity of the next 100 patients a re randomized to 
fPHT but the response rates in the next 100 patients are very s imilar (45% vs. 42% 
vs. 44%).  Therefore the updated r esponse rates see fewer fewer  (50%) of patients 
going to fPHT, 30% to LVT, and 20% to VPA.  After these 100 pat ients (which sees  
ESETT 
 7fPHT have the lowest respose rat e) the overall response rates a re very similar 
across groups: 49% for fPHT, 48%  for VPA, and 47% for LVT.  The  rates are so 
similar, the predictive probability calculation shows that if a nother 220 patients are 
enrolled to achieve the 720 patien t maximum, there is just a 2%  chance that the trial 
will identify either a best or worst treatment. Since this prob ability of achieving the 
trial’s primary aim is less than 5%, the trial stops for futili ty. 
	
5.0	Operating 	Characteristics 	
 
To evaluate how the design perfo rms, we simulated the trial con sidering different 
success rate scenarios.  Operating  characteristics are based on  100,000 simulations 
per scenario. Table 1 shows the success rate scenarios.   
 
Table	1:	Success	Rate	Scenarios

e) All Bad  25%  25%  25% 
f) All Really Bad  10%  10%  10% 
 
These six scenarios represent a range of effects including thre e cases where all 
drugs are equally efficacious (a,e,f), a case where one is far superior to the other two 
(b), another where one is far in ferior to the other two (c), an d another where the 
effect sizes are spread out (d).   The bottom two cases illustra te scenarios where 
none of the three drugs’ benefits exceed the minimum efficacy r equirement. 
Table 2 shows the probabilities of trial success for each of th e 6 success rate 
scenarios. We show 1) the probab ility of stopping the trial ear ly for success, defined 
by identifying the tmax with greater than 97.5% pro bability below the maximum 
sample size; 2) the probability of continuing the trial to the maximum sample size 
and declaring success by identifying the tmax with greater than 97.5% probability; 3) 
the overall probability of identifying the tmax with > 97.5% probability (early or at 
the maximum sample size); 4) the  overall probability of identif ying tmin with > 
97.5% probability (early or at th e maximum sample size); and 5)  the probability of 
trial success by identifying tmax, tmin, or both with > 97.5% probability. 
The false positive rate of this trial is the probability of ide ntifying either the most or 
the least effective treatment, when in truth there is no differ ence between the arms. 
This is illustrated in the “Null”  scenario where all treatment arms have the same 
success rate.  In this scenario, t he probability of identifying  a maximum effective 
treatment is 0.017 and the probab ility of identifying a least e ffective treatment is 
0.021.  Thus, the false positive rate in this scenario is 0.038 , less than a standard 
0.05 level. Similarly, in the “A ll Bad” and “All Really Bad” sc enarios the false positive  
ESETT 
 8rate is 0.036 and 0.005 respectively.  In the “Two Good” scenar io, two of the 
treatment arms have the same su ccess rate and the probability o f identifying one of 
these as the tmax is 0.11.  Similarly, in the “On e Good” scenario, the false pos itive rate 
is 0.039 of erroneously identify ing of the two equally poor tre atments as the worst.

Alternatively, the true positive rate of this trial is the prob ability of identifying 
either the most or the least effe ctive treatment when there are  differences in the 
success rates.  In the “One Good” scenario, one treatment arm h as a 65% success 
rate compared to a 50% success rate in the other two arms.  The  probability of 
identifying a maximum effective treatment is 90%.  In the “Two Good” scenario, one 
arm is ineffective (50% success rate) relative to the other two  (65% success rate) 
and the probability of identifyi ng a least effective treatment is 69%.  In the “One 
Middle One Good” scenario, there is a modest treatment effect i n one arm and a 
strong treatment effec t in another arm.  The probability of ide ntifying the best arm 
as the best is 49%; the probabil ity of identifying either a max imum or a least 
effective treatment is 68%.   
Table 3 shows the mean sample size and the mean allocation to e ach of the three 
treatment arms for each of the s uccess rate scenarios.  The pro portion of the total 
sample size allocated to each ar m is shown in parentheses.  The  most effective 
treatment arm(s) is shown in bol d-italics.  Adaptive allocation  tends to place a 
higher proportion of patients on  the most effective treatment a rm(s).

 9For example in the One Good and O ne Middle, One Good scenarios,  47% of patients 
are randomized to the best treatment, compared to 33% that woul d be in a trial 
with fixed randomization.  In th e scenario where one treatment is worse than the 
two other equally good treatment s, just 17% of patients are ran domized to the 
inferior treatment vs. 33% in a trial with fixed randomization.    In the scenarios 
where there is no difference between treatment arms (Null, All Bad, All Really Bad) 
patients are, on average, evenly allocated.   
 
In every trial one arm w ill be identified as the tmax, however, the probability the best 
observed arm is the tmax may not exceed 97.5%, the criteria to successfully claim we 
have identified the tmax.    Table 4 shows the probability  each arm is identified as th e 
maximum effective treatment ( tmax) and the probability each  arm is identified as the 
maximum effective treatment with  at least 97.5% probability (i. e. obtains the 
success criteria). The arm(s) wi th the highest true success rat e is shown in bold-
italics.  In the “One Good” scena rio, the arm with the highest success rate is 
identified as the tmax with 99.6% probability and thi s arm will achieve the success 
criteria with 90% probability.  I n the “Two Good” scenario, two  arms have the same 
success rate.  Thus, the probability of being tmax is split between these two arms and 
each receives approximately 50% probability of being tmax.  In the “One Middle One 
Good” scenario, the arm with the  highest success rate is identi fied as the tmax with 
96% probability and this arm will achieve the success criteria with 49% probability.

Operating characteristics were c alculated from 100,000 simulate d trials for each of 
the six scenarios.  Therefore eve n when two treatments have the  same efficacy, 
some operating characteristic values aren’t precisely equal. 
Table 5 compares the Bayesian adaptive design to a similar desi gn with early 
stopping but not adaptive randomization.   
In scenarios where one drug offe rs a superior outcome rate to t he other two drugs, 
adaptive randomization increases  the power to identify the best  treatment (90% vs. 
87% in the One Good scenario; 49%  vs. 45% in the One Middle, On e Good scenario) 
while requiring a slightly lower expected sample size (484 vs. 492 in the One Good 
scenario; 592 vs. 597 in the One  Middle, One Good Scenario) and  randomize a higher 
proportion of patients to the be st therapy (47% vs. 33% in the One Good scenario; 
47% vs. 33% in the One Middle One Good scenario).

6.0		Summary 	
This novel Bayesian adaptive comparative effectiveness trial us es adaptive 
randomization with early stopping  to create an efficient trial that offers (1) a 
smaller expected sample size, (2 ) higher power, and (3) a highe r proportion 
patients are likely to be random ized to the best treatment arm when one treatment 
is superior to the other two.   
This comparative effectiveness de sign was presented at the Agen cy for Healthcare 
Research and Quality 2012 conference “Methods for Comparative E ffectiveness 
Research/Patient-Centered Outcom es Research: From Efficacy to E ffectiveness” and 
published (Connor, Elm, & Broglio) in the associated special is sue of the Journal	
Clinical	Epidemiology 	August 2013 .		In that issue’s introductory remarks, the 
conference organizers, Sebastian Schneeweiss, John Seeger, John  Jackson, and Scott 
Smith, claim “The paper by Connor et al. on Bayesian Adaptive T rials for CER makes 
a strong case for the usefulness of adaptive trial designs for more efficiently using 
study resources, maximizing pati ent benefit and minimizing pati ent risk in CER.”  ( J.	
Clin	Epi., August 2013 page S3).
