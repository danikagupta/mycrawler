ABSTRACT 
Phylogenetics studies are mainly concerned with evolutionary relatedness among various groups of organisms. Recently, phylogene tic 
analyses have been performed on a genomic scale to address issues ranging from the prediction of gene and protein function to organismal relationships. Computing the relatedness of organisms either by phylogenetic (gene by gene analyses) or phylogenomic  (the 
whole genome comparison) methods reveals high-quality results for demonstrating phylogenies. In this regard, Phylip (Phylogeny 
Inference Package) software is a free package of programs for inferring phylogenies of living species and organisms. It is now one of the 
most widely used packages for computing accurate phylogenetic trees and carrying out certain related tasks. This paper provides  an 
overview on Phylip package and its applications and contribution to phylogenetic analyses.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
The word phylogenetics is derived from the Greek words, phylon , which means tribe or race, and genetikos , which 
means birth. Phylogenetic analysis could be applied in clas-
sification of living species and organisms, genetic testing and forensics and inferring functions of new genes. All 
these applications allow the researcher to collect data and to 
conduct multiple sequence alignments (MSA) and sub-sequently build phylogenetic tree followed by evaluation 
and visualization of the produced tree. In this regards, 
building trees are usually based on three major types of methods, Distance matrix, Maximum parsimony, and Maxi-
mum likelihood. However Phylip package, does not include 
any program based on Bayesian inference method, it can build trees for many kinds of data with those three different 
methods mentioned above (Felsenstein 1981). In addition, 
one of the nice things about Phylip package is that it can check the reliability of the tree by bootstrapping (Felsen-
stein 1992). Data types that can be handled by Phylip mod-
ules include DNA molecular sequences (e.g. gene frequen-cies, restriction sites), protein sequences (Felsenstein 1996), 
quantitative data (Felsenstein 2005), distance matrices or 
even 0/1 (binary) discrete characters (Felsenstein 2008).  
This short review is aiming to briefly introduce the molecu-
lar biologist to advantages and disadvantages of this pack-
age and its application in biology.  
Phylip: History 
 Since October of 1980, Joseph Felsenstein, University of 
Washington, has created Phylip as a free package of prog-
rams for inferring phylogenies. Phylip was first released in that month, and has been substantially improved in subse-
quent releases. Subsequent versions have been enhanced 
dramatically by adding more programs and methods for trees drawing and accepting different data types (Felsen-
stein 1996). Phylip is currently one of the most widely dis-
tributed phylogenetic analysis software packages since 1980 (Guo et  al. 2008; He et al. 2008; Belyaeva  et al.  2009; 
Völgyi et al . 2009) and integrated into other biological 
knowledge base such as BioBIKE (Elhai et al. 2009). 
 Phylip: Different useful programs 
 
The PHYLIP programs could be classified into five cate-gories ( Table 1 ): 
1- Programs for molecular sequence data (such as 
DNAPARS, PROTPARS, etc.); 
2- Programs for distance matrix data (such as FITCH, 
KITSCH and NEIGHBOR); 
3- Programs for gene frequencies and continuous charac-
ters (such as CONTML, GENDIST and CONTRAST); 
4- Programs for 0-1 discrete state data (such as MIX, 
MOVE, CLIQUE, etc.); 
5- Programs for plotting trees and consensus trees (such as 
DRAWTREE, CONSENSE, etc.). 
 Phylip: Advantages and disadvantages 
 
Advantages:  
- Phylip is very easy to use and free of charge. 
- Phylip is stand-alone software that can run on any com-
puter. 
- The recent version contains many programs for dif-
ferent kinds of data. 
- Some sites make running of Phylip programs available 
as a web server which can also run on (almost) any 
computer that has access to the Internet and can return the results online or by e-mail. 
- It works on as many computer systems such as Win-
dows, Macintosh MacOS X, Macintosh Mac OS and Linux. 
- Phylip contains different programs to analyze DNA and 
amino acid sequence data.  
Disadvantages: 
 - The format requirements for Phylip are rather stringent, 
and any deviation will result in an error message "Un-
able to allocate memory" and then the program ter-minates. 
- 
 Phylip is used in a sequential way; the output from the 
first program is used as an input in the next program. 
- The input or output files in the program folder have 
® Genes, Genomes and Genomics 3 (Special Issue 1) , 46-49 ©2009 Global Science Books  
 always to be named as "infile" ,"outfile" or "outtree" 
respectively which may replace exiting files. Thus the 
user needs to be sure to rename the files he/she wants to save Phylip package does not have any program based 
on Bayesian inference method. 
 Phylip: Software design 
 
Phylip contains more than 35 programs. The source code is written in C and precompiled executables are available for 
Windows
 (95/98/NT/2000/me/XP/Windows  Vista), Mac OS  
8 and 9, Mac OS X, and Linux systems The programs are 
controlled through a menu, which contains many options 
which can be changed, and then allows the user to start. The 
input data should be in flat ASCII or Text Only format. Some sequence alignment programs, like ClustalX and T-
Coffee, can write data files in the Phylip format. Currently 
Phylip has reached version 3.68. Executables were made available also by others for Red Hat Linux RPMs, Debian 
linux executables and executables for FeeBSD. Trees writ-
ten onto outtree, the output file of tree drawing software, are in the Newick format which can be used by many other 
programs. 
 
Limitations: 
 
- Commands that the user should type are written with 12 
pt Courier font. In addition, file names are written with 
12 pt Courier New font and Output from the programs 
is should represented with 10 pt Courier font (Tuimala 2006). 
- The Input files it should be in flat ASCII or Text Only 
format. 
- The font files need to be in the same folder as the Draw-
tree or Drawgram program(s). Phylip availability online

Phylip: Methods and modules 
 Phylip programs can be divided into these categories of 
methods ( Fig. 1 ): 
- Distance methods: These programs make and use mat-
rices of distances and are intended to be used sequen-
tially, the output of one program is the input for the 
other, such as  Dnadist, Protdist, Fitch, Kitsch, and 
Neighbor. 
- Character based methods : These programs read in a 
sequence alignment, and produce either one or multiple trees in the output files, outfile and outtree, such as  
Dnapars, Dnapenny, Dnaml, Dnamlk, Protpars, Proml. 
- Resampling tool:  This tool reads in a sequence align-
ment, and generates a specified number of random sam-
ples into a file outfile, such as  (Seqboot). 
- Tree drawing: These programs draw a tree from the 
specifications in the Newick-format such as (Drawgram, 
Drawtree, Retree). 
- Consensus trees:  This program constructs a consensus 
tree from multiple trees such as (Consense) 
- Tree distances:  This program computes, e.g., a topo-
logy-based distance between two or more trees such as (Treedist).

 CASE STUDIES 
 
Recently, utilization of Phylip modules provided the foun-dation for population genetics in different phyla. it was used 
recently in humans population research to study 215 inde-
pendent Hungarian male samples and the genetic distances to 23 other populations using 49 Y-chromosomal single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 11 Y-chromosomal 
STR loci (Völgyi et al.  2009). It was used to study the phy-
logeny
 of short-chain  dehydrogenases/reductases  (SDRs) in 
both Drosophila melanogaster  and human retinol dehydro-
genase 12 (RDH12) indicating a common ancestry early in bilaterian evolution (Belyaeva et al . 2009). PHYLIP© ver-
sion 3.2 software were used to investigate human migration 
and evolution analysis and construction of phylogenetic tree based on the analysis of human platelet alloantigens (HPA) 
polymorphisms, in five systems which served as the genetic 
marker (Feng et al. 2008), to construct a Familial Mediter-
ranean Fever (FMF) cumulative database and to propose a 
MEFV based phylogenetic tree (Papadopoulos et al.  2008) 
and to conduct phylogenetic analysis of transmembrane re-gions of GPCRs (Murakami et al. 2008).  
In plants, the MaturaseK ( MatK) chloroplast gene, 
which is highly conserved in plant, was used for defining the inter- and intra-generic relationships among family of 
Zingiberaceae family which comprises 47 genera with 
medicinal values using PHYLIP
© modules (Selvaraj et al . 
2008). In the same manner PHYLIP© modules were used in 
animals to analysis of genetic diversity, for instance, in wild 
common  carp  (Cyprinus  carpio  L.) populations using micro-
satellite DNA marker (Li et al.  2007). 
In prokaryotes, Phylip DNA modules were used to 
reveal genetic sequence evolution using 1500 bp fragments of the 16S rDNA gene from Klebsiella pneumoniae  strains 
isolated from diarrhea specimens (Guo et al.  2008). In 
addition, it was used in the phenotypic classification and phylogeny estimation of the mycobacterial strains (Mignard 
and Flandrois 2008) and to analyze the genetic differences 
of Orientia tsutsugamushi  (Ot) Sta56 gene between isolates 
from Shandong, China and other strains deposited in 
GenBank (Liu et al.  2007). 
In virology, Phylip was used for studying phylogeny 
and genotype analysis among viruses such as enterovirus 
type 71, detected from hand-foot-mouth disease patients 
(He el al.  2008) and metapneumoviruses isolated in Chong-
qing, China (Mao et al.  2008). 
 
CONCLUSION  
Many researchers in the field of Molecular biology have 
used Phylip modules during their original research in Phy-logenetics studies. Recently, many genomic evolutionary 
relatedness were discovered in different organisms using 
Phylip new features using published sequences in NCBI database. There are many reasons why Phylip become an 
instant hit these days. With more than 40,000 citations, 
Phylip is one of the most widely cited scientific programs in the history of biology. The freeware license and its efficient 
modules beside its quick ability to produce results make it 
the third popular programs for Phylogenetics studies nowa-days after PAUP* and MrBayes.
