 Abstract  
Bubble column reactors are multiphase contactors that have found several industrial 
applications owing to various  attractive features including excellent thermal management, low 
maintenance cost due to simple construction and absence of moving parts. In order to attain 
desired performance for a given application, these reactors are usually equipped with internals 
such as vertical tube bundles to facilitate heat transfer. The  column hydrodynamics and 
turbulence parameters are altered when the column is occluded with internals which adds to 
the complexity of the problem . The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) too ls for the 
study of multiphase flows has gained a lot of traction over the recent years.  In the current 
study,  CFD is applied to  a 2-Dimensional Eulerian -Eulerian model coupled with Population 
Balance Model (PBM) to simulate  bubble column reactors in the presence and absence of 
internals. The significance of various interfacial forces on the numerical solution has been 
reviewed.  Based on this, a suitable model is chosen which appropriately simulates the gas -
liquid flow and has been selected to perform flo w transition studies which covers the bubbly, 
transition and churn -turbulent regime. An increase in hydrodynamic parameters like centerline 
liquid axial velocity and gas holdup was noticed when the bubble column was occluded with 
circular tube internals. F urthermore, when dense vertical internals were introduced, the 
hydrodynamic values varied and consequently increased. When internals were added, a 
significant variation was noticed in the flow pattern which contributed to superior qualities of 
mixing.

Summary for Lay Audience  
Bubble column reactors are cylindrical vessels that can facilitate substantial interactions 
between a liquid phase and the dispersed gas phase. Bubble columns, in recent years, have 
found their applications in numerous industries owing to their diverse adv antages like low 
energy input, absence of moving parts, low pressure drops, construction simplicity and superior 
rates of heat and mass transfer. In general, bubble columns have been used in the process, 
chemical, metallurgical and biological industries. L ately, these reactors have also been 
employed in novel areas like production of clean fuels, methanol synthesis, Fischer -Tropsch 
synthesis, algae cultivation, biofuel production, biomedical sector as a blood oxygenator etc. 
Regardless of its wide applicati ons, the scale up of these reactors is still an open challenge. 
The prime hurdle in the scale up process is the presence of complex fluid dynamics. When the 
bubble column is obstructed with innards or internals in the form of cylindrical rods, the flow 
pattern and hydrodynamics vary which adds to the complexity of the problem.  In the current 
work, a numerical tool called Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been employed to 
model the bubble column reactor. Information that is vital to the reactor’s scale  up is obtained 
using the tool. The use of such computational tools decreases the laborious time required to 
build pilot setups, thereby increasing the productivity and improving the economics.

1 Introduction  
Bubble column reactors are cylindrical multiphase contactors that can facilitate substantial 
interactions between a liquid phase and the dispersed  gas phase. The gas phase is introduced 
into the column via a gas distributor, also called a sparger. The liqu id phase can be either 
stationary or continuous. When solids are suspended in the liquid phase, the bubble column 
is called as a Slurry Bubble Column (SBC). Due to its diverse advantages like low energy 
input, absence of moving parts, low pressure drops, c onstruction simplicity and superior 
rates of heat and mass transfer, bubble column reactors are used in process, chemical, 
biochemical and metallurgical industries (Youssef et al. , 2012; Majumder, 2019; M öller et 
al., 2019) . Other advantages of bubble columns include enhanced temperature control 
capability, improved mixing abilities, requirement of  lesser maintenance thereby 
decreasing the operation  cost, requirement of reduced floor area and increased interfacial 
areas (Li et al. , 2003; Kantarci et al. , 2005; Abdulrahman, 2015; Besagni et al. , 2018) .  
Bubble column reactors find their use in bulk processes like wastewater effluent treatment, 
Fischer -Tropsch synthesis, clean fuels production, metha nol synthesis, biofuel production, 
wet air oxidation, photo -bioreactions etc. (Deckwer , 1981; Sánchez Mirón et al. , 2000; 
Krishna et al. , 2001; Ranjbar et al. , 2008) .  A revolutionary scale up slurry bubble column 
reactor with diameter 10 m was installed by SASOL at the Oryx GTL plant located at Qatar 
(Botes et al. , 2011) .  When bubble column reactors are employed for exothermic reactions 
like Fischer -Tropsch synthesis, they must be equipped with dense vertical heat exchanging 
tubes to facilitate effective heat exchange (Krishna and Sie, 2000) . Although they are most 2 
 
 widely used, bubble  column internals are not just limited to the heat exchanging rods. Other 
internals include baffles, liquid/gas distributors, perforated plates, helical springs, 
instrumentation probes and down -comers (Youssef et al. , 2013) .  
Over the last six decades, numerous studies have been performed to understand the 
mechanisms involved with scale -up of bubble column reactors. Despite several attempts 
and successful research, scale -up of  bubble columns still imposes a major challenge 
(Dudukovic and Mills, 2014) . Complex hydrodynamics a nd fluid dynamics involved in 
these reactors make the scale -up process really challenging. In addition, when the bubble 
column reactors are occluded with internals, their effect on fluid dynamics, mixing patterns, 
bubble behavior and other hydrodynamic par ameters,  will make the scale -up process more 
complex (Jhawar and Prakash, 2014) .  
Recently, a considerable progress has been achieved in the arena of Computational Fluid 
Dynamics (CFD),  which has become an effective tool in modeling multiphase flows in 
bubble column reactors to study various hydrodynamic aspects, such as velocity profiles, 
phase holdups, mixing patterns and turbulence characteristics, in column reactors (Joshi, 
2001; Ekambara et al. , 2008; Basha et al. , 2015) . To date, several numerical studies have 
been performed on bubble column reactors. While most of the studies have focused on the 
hollow bubble columns, only limited studies were carried for bubb le column with internals.  
Figure 1.1 illustrates the basic steps involved in the CFD modeling of bubble column 
reactors.  3

 1.1 Objectives of the thesis  
The objectives of this study are:  
• To develop a 2D CFD model based on the Eulerian -Eulerian approach for the 
simulation  of multiphase flows in a bubble column reactor with and without 
internals.  The interfacial forces, such as the drag and lift forces, turbulent 
dispersion and bubble induced turbulence will be investigated.  
• To study the hydrodynamics, turbulence and dispersed phase characteristics in the 
bubbly, transition and churn -turbulent regime as well as the flow transition process 
using the proposed CFD model.  
• To understand the effect of circular tube bundles and dense ve rtical internals on the 
hydrodynamics, turbulence and dispersed phase characteristics in the bubbly, 
transition and churn -turbulent regime, and flow transition process.  
 
1.2 Structure of thesis  
This thesis is written  in an “integrated -article” format provided by the School of Graduate 
and Postdoctoral Studies (SGPS) at the University of Western Ontario. It consists of five 
chapters, the summary of which are provided below:  
In Chapter 1, the introductions to the bubble column reactors in both the laboratory and  
industrial scales are provided. The motivation of the work is outlined, and the objectives 
are explicitly stated.  5 
 
 Chapter 2 has two main sections. In the first section, a comprehensive review of the current 
state in the experimental studies of bubble col umn reactors is presented. The effects of 
column diameters, design of internals, and gas distributor designs on the centerline liquid 
axial velocities, gas holdups and other hydrodynamic parameters are critically reviewed. 
In the second section, an extensi ve review of the numerical studies involving bubble 
column reactors is presented. The effects of different CFD models,  including the interfacial 
forces and turbulence models, on the predictions of the turbulence parameters for flows in 
bubble column reacto rs with and without internals are thoroughly reviewed.  
In Chapter 3, numerical models for the simulation of the multi -phase flows in the hollow 
bubble column are presented. First, governing equations and mathematical models are 
thoroughly discussed. This is followed by the experimental and numerical setups. Th e 
results have been divided into two sections. In the first section, the study of the sensitivity 
of interfacial forces in hollow bubble column reactors is presented. The suitable model 
based on the interfacial force study is selected to perform the flow t ransition studies in the 
bubbly, transition and churn -turbulent regimes. In the next section, the results of the flow 
transition study have been outlined.  
In Chapter 4, numerical simulations involving the bubble column with internals is 
performed. The exp erimental and numerical setups are  thoroughly discussed. The results 
are divided into two sections. In the first section, the study of the sensitivity of interfacial 
forces on the flows in the bubble column reactor with tube circular tube bundles is 
provid ed. The suitable model based on the interfacial forces study is selected to perform 
the flow transition studies in the bubbly, transition and churn -turbulent regimes. In the next 
section, the results of the flow transition study are given for the bubble co lumn with circular 6 
 
 tube internals and bubble column with dense vertical internals. The dense internals are used 
to increase the available heat transfer area and induce greater levels of mixing within the 
column.   
In Chapter 5, conclusions for hollow bubble  column and bubble column with vertical 
internals are discussed. In addition, the future scope for the current work are presented.

2 Literature Review  
Bubble column reactors have found applications in a wide range of industrial processes as 
gas-liquid and gas -liquid -solid contactors of choice for their advantages of simple 
construction, low maintenance, and high heat transfer and good mass transfer rates. Some 
of the major industrial applications include oxidation and hydrogenation reactions, Fischer -
Tropsch synthesis, methanol synthesis, heavy oil upgrading, fermentation, biological waste 
water treatment, flue gas desulphurization, dimethyl ether production  (Deckwer , 1981; 
Shah et al. , 1982; Fan, 1989; Devanathan  et al. , 1990; Li and Prakash, 2000, 2002) . 
Although bubble columns are relativel y simple to construct, the interactions between the 
liquid and gaseous phases contained within are complex, intimate and difficult to predict 
or scale -up. For these reasons, characterization and quantification of the gaseous and liquid 
phase interactions i s of great importance. There are two different methods that can be used 
to gain an understanding of bubble column systems. The first category refers to 
empirically -based methods in which rules and guidelines for bubble column design and 
scale -up are derive d from trends in experimental data (Deckwer et al. , 1993) . The second 
category refers to model -based methods in which theoretical models are applied to the 
system of interest after flow regime analysis has been carried out (Deckwer et al. , 1993) . 
It is not uncommon to find a mix of both methods in an industrial setting. However, a 
greater dependence on model -base methods is encouraged as they provide additional 
insight to a reactor’s performance and a basis for reactor design.  10 
 
 2.1 Hydrodynamics of Bubble Column  
A good understandi ng of hydrodynamics is necessary for successful design and operation 
of bubble column reactors.  The important hydrodynamic parameters include:  Flow 
regimes ; Phase holdups ; Bubble size and bubble wake dynamics  and Flow patterns and 
phase mixing . Bubble colu mns can operate in three main types of flow regimes depending 
on operating conditions.  
1.  Dispersed bubble or homogeneous flow regime  
2.  Coalesced bubble or heterogeneous flow regime  
3.  Slugging regime  
Often, these flow regimes (and their boundaries) are determined visually. A simplified flow 
regime diagram is presented in Figure 2. 1.  More detailed flow regime charts are given by 
Fan (1989)  and Schumpe  et al. ( 2004) . 
 
Figure 2.1 Simplified flow regime map for multiphase systems  
 
               
 
 
 
 
 
Heterogeneous 
regime   11 
 
 - In the dispersed bubble regim e, small bubbles are well dispersed in the bed. There 
is little bubble -to-bubble collision thus reducing the possibility of bubble 
coalescence. This regime is favored by low superficial gas velocities (< 0.05 m/s) 
in bubble columns and large liquid velocit ies and large particles (3 -5mm) in three -
phase fluidized beds.  
- In heterogeneous or coalesced bubble regime, there is continuous bubble 
coalescence and break up along the column height with the dynamic mean bubble 
size remaining nearly constant. This regime  is likely to occur with high superficial 
gas velocities  (>0.1 m/s), low superficial liquid velocities and small particles (<2 
mm).  
- The slugging regime mainly occurs in small experimental columns (< 0.05 m) and 
is seldom encountered in industrial scale re actors.  
Phase holdup which represents fraction of total volume occupied by individual phase in the 
system  is primary design information for multiphase reactor systems .  A large number of 
methods have been proposed in the literature for phase holdup measure ments (Linneweber 
and Blass, 1983; Bukur  et al. , 1987; Maezawa et al. , 1995; Youssef and Al -Dahhan, 2009) . 
Some methods measure overall average, some measure cross sectional average and some 
other methods measure local holdups. A simple and quick method for estimation of average 
gas holdup is based on static (𝐻𝑠) and dispersion/ expanded bed heights  (𝐻𝑑).  
𝜀𝐺=𝐻𝑑−𝐻𝑠
𝐻𝑑      (2.1)  12 
 
 Small bubbles contribute to higher gas holdups due to their low rise velocities, while large 
bubbles due to their fast rise velocities contribute less. Small bubbles in a dispersion 
provide high interfacial area for mass tra nsfer. Therefore, their population is desirable for 
most applications.  Bubbles are formed at the distributor and tend to grow initially due to 
coalescence. Large bubbles tend to split so that the ultimate bubble size distribution 
depends on a balance betwe en coalescence and break -up. The processes of bubble 
coalescence and break -up result in wide bubble size distribution specially in coalesced 
bubble  or heterogeneous flow regime . In multi -bubble systems, the bubble size follows a 
log-normal distribution  (Darton, 1974; Matsuura et al. , 1984) . The shape of the bubble 
depends mainly on bubble size. Under the same operating conditions, the bubble shape 
changes as below:  
- Spherical shape (small bubbles; d b < 4 mm)  
- Ellipsoidal shape (intermediate bubbles; 5mm < d b < 1 cm )  
- Spherical -cap (large bubbles; d b > 1 cm)  
The motion of bubbles and their associated wake give rise to different flow structures and 
flow patterns depending upon operating flow regime (i.e. disperse d bubble flow and 
coalesced bubble flow).  As the gas velocity exceeds 0.05 m/s, the spiral flow pattern breaks 
down due to intensive bubble coalescence and gradual break -up processes. Momentum is 
transferred from the primary bubble wakes to the surroundin g liquid through the roll -up 
and shedding phenomena of the bubble wakes (Tsuchiya  et al.,  1990 ).  Large coalesced 
bubbles ascending in the column lead to a gross liquid flow pattern for the liquid (or slurry) 
with an upward flow in the core region and a downward flow near the wall (Figure 2. 2). 13 
 
  
Figure 2.2 Recirculating flow pattern of liquid induced by bubbles (Adapted from Hills 
(1974) ) 
The radial variation of gas holdup provides the driving force for the recirculation flow. An 
equation for circulating liquid flow was developed by Ueyama and Miyauchi (1979)  
starting with Navier -Stokes equation and following main assumptions.  
- radial pressure remains constant  
- molecular viscosity is negligible in turbulent core compared to turbulent 
viscosity

A second boundary condition is from velocity distribution in turbulent flow. The thickness

𝑈=𝑈𝑤 at 𝑟=𝑅     (2.8) 15 
 
 Equation 2. 2 can be integrated with above conditions to obtain local liquid velocity in

Wachi  et al.  (1987)   have also developed equation for liquid velocity at wall of the column.  
2.2 Bubble Column  with Internals  
Bubble columns often need to be equipped with internals of different types  in order to 
obtain desired performance for a given application . These include baffles, heat transfer 
surfaces  and gas/liquid distributors of different configurations. The internals presence and 
arrangement in bubble columns would affect hyd rodynamics and mixing pattern, thereby 
affecting the reactor performance.  Only a limited number of literature studies have 
investigated effects of internals on bubble column hydrodynamics (Jhawar and Prakash 
2011; Youssef et al. 2012; Faı¨çal Larachi et al. 2006; J. Chen et al. 1999; Schlüter  et al. 
1995; Saxena  et al., 1992) . These studies point to alterations in flow pattern, mixi ng 
intensities and general hydrodynamics due to insertion of internals in a hollow bubble 
column. However, there is need to quantify the effects of internals arrangements on 16 
 
 important design parameters such as phase holdups, liquid backmixing and interfaci al area 
for mass transfer.   
A common type of internal is a set of vertical tubes providing heat transfer surface for 
temperature control as shown schematically in Figure 2.3.  In-situ installation of these 
internals provides multiple advantages including higher heat transfer rate, better control of 
reactor temperature reducing the need for an external exchanger (Schlüter  et al., 1995) . The 
presence of internals , however,  affect phase holdups, flow patterns and phase mixing.   
      
Figure 2.3 Schematic of bubble column with vertical tube internals  
The selection of the number of tubes or the cross -sectional area (CSA) occluded by the 
tubes, and the configuration of the tubes ( i.e. the diameter, pitch and arrangement)  are 
decided by the surface area necessary for the heat transfer. This mainly depends on the 
exothermic nature of the reaction and the overall heat transfer coefficient. The 
 
 
 
17 
 
 modifications for different CSA or tube size and configurations have significant e ffect on 
the hydrodynamics. Experimental studies on the effect s of longitudinal flow tube bundle 
on column  hydro dynamics have been reported in several literature studies (Schlüter et al. , 
1995; Chen et al. , 1999 ; Youssef et al. , 2009, 2013; Jhawar et al. , 2014; Kagumba et al. , 
2015; Al Mesfer et al. , 2016, 2017; George et al. , 2017; Sultan et al. , 2018) . 
2.2.1  Effects of Internals on Column Hydrodynamics  
The internals design parameters mostly investigated in literat ure studies include , number 
and size of tubes, cross -sectional area (CSA) of column occupied and different 
arrangements of tubes. Presence of internals can further complicate, the complex 
hydrodynamics of bubble column. The hydrodynamic parameters affected  include phase 
holdup profiles, flow patterns, liquid velocity profile etc.  Figure 2.4 shows a representation 
of typical profiles as an effect of internals in the column. Further details of the effect of 
different internals reported in experimental litera ture studies have been discussed in the 
following  section s. 18 
 
  
Figure 2.4 Typical profiles in the presence of internals (Möller et al., 2018)  
A number of literature studies have reported increase in gas holdups in the presence of 
internals (Yamashita, 1987; Pradhan et al. , 1993; Youssef and Al -Dahhan, 2009; Al Mesfer 
et al. , 2016) . The extent of increase, however, has been found to depend on the size and 
number of tubes and their layout. Yamashita (1987)  reported an increase in gas holdup with 
diameter of single and multiple internals with number and size of internals while remaini ng 
same for different arrangements of the internals. The earliest explanations of these 
observations in various studies reasoned that the increase in gas holdup was solely due to 
decrease in free surface area for gas phase in the presence of internals resu lting in a higher 
gas velocity. This was further supported by the work of Bernemann (1989) . This theory 
was, however,  contested by Al Mesfer et al.  (2016)  by plotting the gas -holdup based on 
19 
 
 both total and free surface area. It was reported that the gas holdup at the center can be 
extrapolated from that of column without internals at higher inlet superficial velocities 
while an increase near the wall region was observed as an effect of internals. However, this 
phenomena is observed more with asymmetrically arranged internals than with circular 
tube bundles which cause bubbles to coalesce at the center region. Pradhan et al. (1993 ) 
reported higher holdup with helical coils in comparison to vertical internals. The author 
proposed that with the presence of internals (both helical and vertical), the area for gas 
phase motion is reduced, as a result the gas phase move more vigorously in radial 
direction s. While the large tube -to-tube space of vertical internals allow large bubble to 
escape directly, the coils promote smaller bubbles, giving rise to higher gas holdup.   
Guan et al.  (2015)  studied the hydrodynamics in a column with pin fin tube internals. They 
found that these internals have significant effect on local and overall gas holdup as well as 
liquid axial velocity. It was also reported that the presence of pin fin tube reduces the gas 
distributor region in the column. Further, changing the internal configuration, flow with no 
downward liquid flow can be realized with severe short circuiting. Further work on heat 
exchanging, RTD and mass transfer was suggested by the authors . Balamurugan et al. , 
(2010)  studied the increase in gas  holdup on inclusion of a vibrating helical coil type 
internal. It was reported that these internals increased the gas holdup by 135% from that 
without internals, due to breakup of bubbles by vibrating spring reducing their rise velocity 
and increasing the  gas holdup.  
2.2.1.1  Effects of Internals on Local Holdups  
Local gas holdup measurements in presence of internals were conducted by Jasim (2016)  
using a four point optical probe to investigate the effect of configuration (circular and 20 
 
 hexagonal) and size of internals in same circular configuration (1.27 and 2.56 cm) on gas 
holdup and gas phase hydrodynamics with a constant CSA of 25%.  A steeper increase and 
higher local gas holdup with both the circular arrangement s was observed  in the core region 
and a decrease at the wall regions. This implies a substantiated flow of gas to the center 
with circular arrangements. This may arise due to  funneling effect causing gas to move at 
the low -pressure core region aided by  bubble  coalescence due to unrestricted flow at the 
center. For the smallest tube -to-tube space being (21.4 mm ), the flow of large bubble across 
the bundle is restricted. While t he arrangement with larger internals with a central tube and 
large tube -to-tube space enhanced the gas holdup and specific interfacial area near the wall 
regions. An asymmetrical radial profile for gas holdup and specific interfacial area were 
obtained for  the hexagonal arrangement.  
The local effects of internals configurations were investigated in more details in a recent 
work Möller et al. (2018)  using ultrafast X -ray tomography . The study investigated the 
effect s of different configurations and size of internals on gas holdup, bubble size 
distribution, bubble frequency and flow pattern s. The radial gas holdup profile showed an 
oscillatory non uniform and flat profile in the vicinity of internals, in comparison to the 
parabolic profile in case of empty bubble column in both the bubbly and churn turbulent 
regime. They found an increasing gas holdup near the walls  (kept free of internals) with 
decreasing pitch and subchannel area with bubbles preferentially rising in the wall zone 
with free wall area. Further, a distinction between the profiles for triangular and square 
profile was observed  with considerably lower gas holdup in tube bundles for triangular 
pitch giving it a non -uniform holdup profile. This is  attributed to  smaller sub channels for 
triangular pitch with lower hydraulic diameters for flow in the bundle. A higher holdup 21 
 
 with sup erficial velocity was observed for square configuration (with higher hydraulic 
diameter) than with triangular (with lower hydraulic diameter). It was reasoned that the 
large bubbles formed in the triangular configuration move faster compared to the square 
configuration, where bubbles are trapped in subchannels having a lower velocity and 
increasing holdup in the column.  
2.2.1.2  Effects on Liquid Flow Patterns  
The gas entering a bubble column moves upwards, preferably along the center, transferring 
momentum to liquid flow. This upward velocity of liquid phase consequently creates a 
recirculation in the downward direction in the near wall region. This large -scale  
recirculation is the result of upward liquid velocity at the core region and a downward 
velocity near the walls in an empty bubble column. The presence of internals, however, 
affect this flow profile. While a circular bundle with no internal in the core r egion gives an 
enhanced central liquid velocity and a much more profound recirculation, the presence of 
a asymmetric internals decreases the magnitude of liquid velocity over the entire column, 
thus dampening the recirculation and large scale flow patterns . George et al.  (2017)  
performed mixing experiments to examine t he effects of internals on liquid recirculation 
and mixing in the presence of internals. The work examined a tube bundle type internal 
with a low CSA (approx. 10%) with an empty core region and a baffle. They reported a 
reduction in back -mixing effects wit h inclusion of baffle type internal placed below the 
tube bundle type internal. Further, studies revealed the effect of internals on time averaged 
flow patterns. It was  reasoned that the presence of baffle type internal divert the large 
bubbles, creating a  stronger vortical flow region that acts against the back -mixing, and 
enhancing the mixing in distributor region due to lower volume and more energetic flows.  22 
 
 Guan et al.  (2014)  conducted studies with different gas distributors in the presence of 
internals. They found that the effect of variation of distributor is global in the presence of 
internals as opposed t o local impacts in hollow column. The type of gas distributor 
employed was able to modify the overall flow patter of the column including the gas holdup 
and liquid velocity profiles. This was because with presence of internals, existence of well -
developed region is difficult to form, and it was suggested the distributor design can be 
used as a source of controlling flow pattern in the column.  
Forret et al.  (2003)  reported an increase in axial liquid velocity at the core while the radial 
profile remain ed the same. Also, an enhanced large scale recirculation in a l arge column 
with internals was observed, due to lower liquid velocity fluctuations with internals  which 
is in agreement with observations of  Chen et al.  (1999) . In a recent study, Möller et al.  
(2018) , discovered that the presence of internals divided the column into section of liquid 
ascending regions (sub channels) and descending regions  (tube bridges and near the wall). 
Therefore, the liquid circulation eddies formed with dimensions of half the pitch, lead ing 
to a dampened liquid turbulence and energy strongly impacting the circulation p attern . It 
was concluded that the internals shift the gas holdup towards the wall and invert the profile 
compared to the empty BCR. This is most profound in configurations with highest flow 
resistance.  
Dispersion in bubble column consists of two processes, the large -scale recirculation from 
upward and downward flow regions and turbulence or fluctuating velocity contributing to 
radial and axial mixing (Forret et al. , 2003) . The presence of internals affects the processes 
responsible for dispersion and promote or dampen them. Generally, it has been repo rted 23 
 
 that the presence of internals increase large scale recirculation and decrease fluctuations 
(Chen et al. , 1999; Forret et al. , 2003; Youssef et al. , 2013; George et al. , 2017) .  
2.3 CFD Modeling of Bubble Column Hydrodynamics  
Over the years, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations have emerged as a 
promising tool to investigate  bubble hydrodynamics including gas holdup profiles, liquid 
velocity profiles, mixing time and shear stress profiles (Jakobsen, Lindborg, & Dorao, 
2005; Joshi, 2001;  Joshi & Nandakumar, 2015) . Most of the studies have f ocused on 
hollow bubble column and only a few recent CFD simulation studies have been performed 
in bubble column with internals (Faı¨çal L  
arachi et al. , 2006; Guan et al. , 2014, 2017; Guo et al. , 2017) . The task of simulating the 
complex hydrodynamics of a bubble column operating in a heterogeneous regime b ecomes 
even more challenging in presence of internals. There is need to select appropriate 
modelling approach and modeling parameters and boundary conditions for more realistic 
simulation results while maintaining ensuring reasonable computational time. Two widely 
used modeling approaches for describing multiphase hydrodynamics in CFD simulations 
are Eulerian -Eulerian (E -E) and Eulerian -Lagrangian (E -L) (Buwa et al. , 2002; Van 
Wachem et al. , 2002; Darmana et al. , 2009) . In the E -E model both the dispersed and 
continuous phases are treated as interpenetrating continuum while  the volume -averaged 
mass and momentum equations  describe the time -dependent motion of phases (Deen et 
al., 2001; Buwa et al. , 2002) . The number of bu bbles present in a computational cell is 
represented by a volume fraction in the balance equations. The information of the bubble 
size distribution can be obtained by incorporating population balance equations to account 
for bubbles break -up and coalescenc e (Darmana et al. , 2009) . The E -L approach tracks 24 
 
 motion of dispersed phase particl es using Newtonian equation of motion while motion of 
the continuous phase is modeled using a Eulerian framework. Tracking the motion of 
dispersed phase particles allows direct consideration of effects related to bubble -bubble 
and bubble -liquid interaction s. Mass transfer with and without chemical reaction, bubble 
coalescence and redispersion can be incorporated directly (Becker et al. , 1994; Delnoij et 
al., 1997) . A drawback of E -L model compared to E -E model is significant increase in 
computational time as number of bubbles (particles) to be simulated increase. Since for 
each bubble one equation of motion needs to be solved, making the method less attractive 
for large scale bubble column reactors (Darmana et al. , 2009) . Since, tracking a huge 
number of bubbles requires a overwhelming  amount of computational time, the Eulerian -
Eulerian approach is more popular and used for the purposes discussed in this work. In 
addition, the high  volume fraction of the dispersed phase renders the Lagrangian approach 
unsuitable for the churn turbulent regime. A two -fluid model based on the Euler -Euler 
approach treats both the phases as continuum and their mechanics is governed by partial 
differential equations. The equations are solved where variables are ensemble averaged 
over time and space while calc ulating the point phase fraction. The conservation equations 
are solved for each phase together with interphase exchange terms. Various interfacial 
forces are used to solve transport equations as closures for interactions between the phases.  
Eulerian -Euler ian Model  
The basic equation set consists of the continuity (conservation of mass) and momentum 
equations for N p phases as detailed below (Pfleger and Becker, 2001)

 Eulerian -Lagrangian  
This modeling approach computes the motion of each bubble from bubble mass and 
momentum equations. The liquid phase contributions are accounted for by the interphase 
mass transfer rate and the net force experienced by each bubble (Darmana et al. , 2009) . 
For an incompressible bubble, the equations can be written as  
Bubble mass balance:  
𝜌𝑏𝑑(𝑉𝑏)
𝑑𝑡=(𝑚̇𝑙→𝑏−𝑚̇𝑏→𝑙)     (2.15) 
Here , 𝑉𝑏 is bubble volume and 𝑣 is bubble velocity. The term on right hand side represents 
mass transfer.

∑𝐹 represents the net force experienced by individual bubble which include gravity, 
pressure, drag, lift force and virtual mass.  
∑𝐹=𝐹𝑔 +𝐹𝑃+𝐹𝐷+𝐹𝐿+𝐹𝑉𝑀   (2.17) 
Liquid phase balances:  
The liquid phase equations consist of continuity and momentum equations represented by 
the volume averaged Navier -Stokes equations. The presence of b ubbles is reflected by the 27 
 
 liquid phase volume fraction , which are outlined in  Darmana et al.  (2009)  for additional 
details of model equations.  
A summary of the  literature  studies  based on the effect of internal geometries on 
hydrodynamics in the column using numerical modeling is  presented in Appendix A . The 
first CFD study of bubble columns with vertical internals was performed by Larachi et al.  
(2006) . The effect of different configurations and covered CSA were simulated. The  study 
revealed effect of arrangements on the liquid circulation pattern, inter -tube gap on growth 
of flow structures (small scale recirculation) and overall effect of internals on turbulence 
parameters.   
In a conventional bubble column reactor, the gas p hase is bubbled through the stationary 
liquid phase. The dispersion of gas in the liquid medium imparts turbulence and alters the 
interphase forces such as drag, lift, virtual mass etc. Several literature studies have focused 
on the study of various models  that are available for the turbulence and interphase forces 
(Joshi, 2001; Jakobsen et al. , 2005; Ta bib et al. , 2008; Selma et al. , 2010; Besagni et al. , 
2017) . To date, different methodologies like Euler -Euler, Euler -Lagrangian and Algebraic 
Slip Mixture Model (ASMM) have been applied to model the gas -liquid flows.       
The current review is divided  into two sections. In the first section, a comprehensive review 
of numerical studies on hollow bubble column reactors has been made. In the next section, 
numerical studies on bubble columns with internals has been thoroughly reviewed and 
presented.  28 
 
 2.3.1  Turbul ence Models     
A wide range of viscous models have been employed to model the highly turbulent flow 
within bubble column reactors. These comprise of the Standard  𝑘−𝜀, 𝑘−𝜀 RNG, 𝑘−𝜔 
and the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM). Few of the recent studies have also employed the 
Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model to simulate the turbulence within bubble 
columns. The right choice of turbulence model is essential to capture the transient flows 
which determines the velocities and other hydrodynamic parameters within the bubble 
column reactor.  
2.3.1.1  Standard 𝑘−𝜀 model

Equations 2.1 and 2.2 have been modified to analyze the effect of multiphase flow 
(ANSYS, 2 013).  Turbulent viscosity is the momentum transfer by the virtue of eddies 
which generates internal fluid friction. This is defined as:  
𝜇𝑡=𝜌𝑙𝐶𝜇𝑘2
𝜀      (2.20) 
 𝐺𝑘,𝑙 is a source term which accounts for the turbulent kinetic energy production:  29 
 
 𝐺𝑘,𝑙=𝜇𝑙,𝑡𝑆𝑞2      (2.21) 
where 𝑆𝑞 represents the modulus of the mean strain rate tensor.  
𝑆𝑞=√𝑆𝑞,𝑖𝑗𝑆𝑞,𝑖𝑗      (2.22) 
𝑆𝑘,𝑙 and 𝑆𝜀,𝑙 signify the source terms that account for the consequence of turbulent two -
way coupling. Here, 𝜎𝑘 and 𝜎𝜀 represent the turbulent Prandtl numbers, and 𝐶1,𝜀, 𝐶2,𝜀 and 
𝐶𝜇 are constants. The values of these constants that are suggested by Launder and 
Spalding (1974)  have been outlined in Table 2. 1.

Simulation of cylindrical bubble columns with the standard k-ε model  was tested by (Silva, 
d’Ávila and Mori  (2012) . The study was conducted both in the bubbly regime (2 c m/s) and 
the heterogenous regime (8 cm/s). In the fully developed region, the radial gas holdup and 
axial velocities have nearly matched the experimental data. In their study, Krishna and Van 
Baten, (2001)  have utilized the standard k-ε model  to model the small and large bubble size 
fractions within a bubble column reactor. They have reported close conformance of axial 
disper sion coefficients and liquid velocities with the experimental data. A study carried out 
by Pfleger and Becker, (2001)  have employed the standard k-ε model to simulate mono -
dispersed flow within bubble column reactors. In the bubbly flow regime, the numerical 30 
 
 study was able to successfully the predict low scale of velocity fluctuations. Large scale 
instantaneous vortical flow structures were appropriat ely modeled by introducing the k-ε 
turbulence model. The numerical values of liquid axial velocities closely conformed to the 
experimental values measured by LDA. However, the numerical values of radial gas 
holdup have underpredicted the local and overall gas holdups. The authors report that the 
addition of Bubble Induced Turbulence (BIT) term to the turbulence model improves the 
prediction of liquid velocities but depreciates the gas holdup estimates. In their study, 
Becker et al.  (1994)  have reported that the standard k-ε model has overestimated the 
turbu lent viscosities which in turn decreases the number of vortices, a behavior that 
contradicts to the experimental observations.  
In summary, the standard k-ε model is suitable in predicting the bubble column flow in the 
fully developed regime. This model ca n effectively predict hydrodynamic parameters like 
local and overall gas holdups and liquid velocities. Information on the suitability of the k-
ε model in the prediction of turbulent parameters for bubble column flows is disputed and 
must be further invest igated.  
2.3.1.2  RNG 𝑘−𝜀 model  
The k-ε Renormalization Group (RNG)  model  is superior when compared to the s tandard 
k-ε model  as it can effectively predict the swirling motion of flows. The principle difference 
between the standard and RNG k-ε model is that the constants are explicitly determined by 
the latter compared to the determination of the constants by experimental techni ques in the 
former. The transport equations that govern the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation 
rates for the primary phase are shown in equations 2.6 and 2.7 respectively.  31

where 𝜏 is the time scale and 𝐶𝜀𝐵 may depend on additional dimensio nless variables 
corresponding to the ratio of length or velocity scales (Rzehak and Krepper, 2013) .  
In their study, Ekambara and Dhotre (2010) have compared the suitability of various 
turbulence models in bubble column simulations. In the sparger region, RNG k-ε model 
was unable to capture the anisotropic nature of the liquid flow. They have reported that the 
RNG k-ε model was able to appropriately capture the liquid axial velocities and fractional 
gas holdups at various axial locations. However, the RNG k-ε model overestimated the 32 
 
 values of turbulent kinetic energy in the distributor region. Also, the RNG k-ε model has 
underestimated the values of turbulence dissipation rate near the wall region at higher axial 
locations.  In another study carried out by Liu and Hinrichsen (2014) , the applicability of 
RNG k-ε model has been tested. This model overestimated the values of turbulence 
dissipation rate close to the wall region. As the bubble size distribution is affected by the 
turbulenc e dissipation rates, a large variation in the Sauter mean diameter near the wall 
region was observed. This resulted in the generation of bubbles with smaller diameters 
which contradicts to the experimental observations.  
2.3.1.3  Reynolds Stress Model (RSM)  
The Rey nolds Stress Model (RSM) employs a different technique in modeling the 
Reynolds stresses. This model was first developed by (Launder, Reece and Rodi, 1975) .  
The f ormulation of a separate transport equation for each tensor eliminates the assumption 
of proportionality between  Reynolds stress tensor and mean deformation rate (Gatski and 
Jongen, 2000; Hamlington and Dahm, 2008) . The simplified transport equations for the 
RSM model is illustrated in Equation 2.12.

The Reynolds stress model is effectively superior to the s tandard k -ε model  and RNG  k-ε 
model  in the prediction of swirling motion of flows within b ubble column reactors 33 
 
 (Launder et al. , 1975; Cokljat et al. , 2006) . In thei r study, Cartland Glover and G eneralis 
(2004)  have reported that the Reynolds stress model is capable of effectively capturing the 
unsteady flow structures present in bubble columns. The vertical velocity profile was 
reported to be constantly changing with each time step. This behav ior was not observed on 
using the two model turbulence equations. Also, the hydrodynamic parameters captured by 
the Reynolds stress model were in close correspondence to the experimental values. In a 
recent  study of comparison between different turbulence models carried out by Parekh and 
Rzehak (2018) , RSM model was able to capture the pronounced wall peaks in the radial 
gas holdup profiles similar to the experimental trend. All the turbulence models in 
consideration overestimated the liquid flux in the wall region. However, RSM offered a 
lesser degree  of overprediction compared to the other turbulence models. A close 
prediction of shear stress values was achieved using RSM model.  
2.3.2  Interfacial Forces  
Interfacial forces play a major role in the computational modelling of multiphase flows. 
The standard mo mentum balance equation is modified to include the influence of these 
forces. Various interfacial forces include drag, lift, added virtual mass, turbulent dispersion 
and turbulent interaction forces.  The drag force, known as the chief force, involved in t he 
bubble column reactor modelling, has been widely studied in various literature studies. The 
effect of other interfacial forces is not very pronounced in the literature and very few studies 
focus on the combined effect of these forces. When the numerical  studies involve the 
combined effect of the appropriate interfacial forces, it will lead to an accurate prediction 
of hydrodynamic parameters.  34 
 
 2.3.2.1  Virtual Mass Force  
In multiphase flows, the effect of virtual mass force is experienced when a dispersed phase 
accelerates with respect to the stationary phase. In bubble column reactors, the virtual mass 
force is exerted by the action of bubbles accelerating through the liquid phase. This is a 
result of inertial force influenced by the liquid phase when encountered by the gaseous 
bubbles rising through the liquid column. The influence of added mass force is prominent 
in the case of transient flows involved in a bubble column reactor due to the significant 
difference in densities between liquid and gas phase.  
The added mass force is characterized by:  
𝐹⃗𝑣𝑚,𝐿=𝜀𝐺𝜌𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑀(𝑑𝐺
𝑑𝑡 𝑢⃗⃗𝐺−𝑑𝐿
𝑑𝑡 𝑢⃗⃗𝐿)   (2.30) 
The derivative associated with the above equation is termed as the phase material time 
form, which is defined as:  
𝑑𝐺
𝑑𝑡(𝑓)=𝜕(𝑓)
𝜕𝑡+(𝑢⃗⃗𝐺.∇)𝑓   (2.31) 
The value of virtual mass coefficient for spherical shaped bubbles is  𝐶𝑉𝑀=0.5. The virtual 
mass force plays an important role in reaching the stability at early stages of the flow 
formation within a bubble column reactor. When virtual mass force is  enabled  in the 
numerical study, bubbles  accelerations through the liquid column are limited. Once the 
simulation reaches the pseudo -steady state, the influence of virtual mass force is 
insignificant (Smith, 1998; Dhotre et al. , 2009) .  35 
 
 2.3.2.2  Drag Force  
The drag force is the resistance experienced by the bubbles rising through the column of 
liquid. The drag force could be a combination of two types of resistances including skin 
friction and form drag. The influence of drag force on two -phase bubble column s is 
superior when compared to other interfacial forces like turbulent dispersion, lift, virtual 
mass and turbulent interaction forces. The axial velocities and overall holdups of gaseous 
phase within the bubble column are strongly governed by the drag mod el. It becomes an 
important parameter as it determines the terminal velocity and residence time of bubbles  
(Yang et al. , 2018) .  
Yang et al.  (2018)  have studied the influence of drag force on the bubble swarms as it is 
quite different from single bubbles. The bubble rise velocities of bubble swarms are non -
identical to that of the s ingle bubbles, due to which the drag coefficients and terminal 
velocities of the former are different from the latter. Complex bubble interactions 
associated with the bubble swarms is another factor which affects the variation seen in drag 
coefficients.  
The drag force between the gas and liquid phase is described as:  
𝐹𝐷,𝑙=0.75𝜀𝐿𝜌𝐿𝐶𝐷
𝑑𝑏 |𝑢𝐺−𝑢𝐿|(𝑢𝐺−𝑢𝐿)    (2.32) 
The drag coefficient,  𝐶𝐷, is a function of liquid properties, hydrodynamic interaction 
between the bubbles and flow regimes. When the bubble size distribution within a bubble 
column reactor under consideration is constant, a constant drag force coefficient could be 
employed. A few  studies by Smith (1998 ), Pfleger and Becker (2001 ) and Dhotre and Smith 36 
 
 (2007)  have been carried out that illustrates the effect of constant drag force as the 
interfacia l force.  
Variety of drag force models such as Schiller -Naumann, Zhang -Vanderheyden, Tomiyama 
et al., Grace et al. and Ishii -Zuber have been widely used in numerically solving bubble 
column reactors.   
The drag coefficient for the Schiller and Naumann drag force model is described as  
𝐶𝑑={24 (1+0.15 𝑁𝑅𝑒0.687)
𝑁𝑅𝑒,𝑁𝑅𝑒≤1000
0.24,                             𝑁𝑅𝑒>1000   (2.33)  
The Reynolds Number ( Re) associated with this drag model is the bubble Reynolds number 
which is determined using the effective bubble diameter, slip velocity between the primary 
and secondary phases, liquid properties such as dynamic viscosity and density.  
𝑅𝑒=𝜌𝐿|𝑣𝐿⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗−𝑣𝐺⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗|𝑑𝑏
𝜇𝐿     (2.34)  
Many literature studies have suggested that t he Schiller Naumann drag force model is well 
suited for gas -liquid flows in the bubbly flow regime, where the superficial gas velocities 
are below 5 cm/s. This drag model does not account for the shape factor of the bubbles as 
the Eotvos number is absent in the drag force formulation. The hydrod ynamics of the two -
phase flows is well captured in the current drag model as it takes the Reynolds number into 
consideration, which in turn is a function of bubble diameter.  
In a study conducted by Law et al.  (2008) , Schiller -Naumann and White and Corfield  
(2006)  drag models were compared to simulate a bubble column in bubbly and churn -37 
 
 turbulent regime.  At lower and higher axial height s, the Schiller -Naumann and White and 
Corfield  (2006)  drag model exhibited close accordance of hydrodynamic parameters with 
experime ntal data. Schiller -Naumann model worked better at higher axial heights 
compared to the White model. In the bubbly flow regime, the authors have recommended 
the addition of surface tension and bubble induced turbulence models to the drag models 
to accurate ly predict the flow dynamics. In contrast to the observations made by some 
others, Schiller Naumann drag model has been successfully implemented by Chen et al.  
(2004 ) and  Kumar et al. , (2011) , to study the hydrodynamics in bubble column reactors 
operating in the churn turbulent regimes and the numerical results were in close 
conformance with those of the experimental observations.  
The Tomiyama drag model is well suited for studying bubble columns in the transition and 
churn turbulent regimes where the bubble size distribution is wide. This drag model takes 
the shape factor of the gaseous bubbles into consideration as the Eotvos numbe r (Eo) is 
present in the drag model formulation. The Eotvos number is a dimensionless parameter 
which governs the bubble shapes by comparing the gravitational and surface tension forces.  
In their study, Guan and Yang (2017) have reported that the use of t his drag model 
overpredicts the values of gas phase holdups and underpredicts the circulation intensity.  
The study also concluded that Tomiyama drag model demonstrated least agreement with 
the experimental data in the absence of the effect of lateral forc es like lift, turbulent 
dispersion and wall lubrication forces.  
The bubble shape is an important parameter in the estimation of drag coefficient (Ceylan, 
Altunbacs and Kelbaliyev, 2001; Tran -Cong, Gay and Michaelides, 2004; Simonnet et al. , 
2007) . In their work, Grace  et al.  (1976)  demonstrated that the terminal velocity of a rising 38 
 
 gas bubble in a stagnant liquid can be linked with the Morton and Eötvös number. Morton 
number is a function of the property group of the primary and secondary phases (Bhaga 
and Weber, 1981; Koynov et al. , 2005)  and Eötvös number is the ratio of buoyancy t o the 
surface tension forces (Roghair et al. , 2011; Aoyama et al. , 2016) . The Grace et al. (1974) 
model has not been used extensively in the literature to simulate the bubble column flows. 
Silva et al.  (2012)  have stud ied and compared the effect of different drag models like Ishii 
and Zuber (1979) , Zhang and Vanderheyden (2002)  and Grace  et al.  (1976) . They have 
reported that Grace drag model predicted uniform gas holdup profile in the central region 
while a slight deviation of 12% is noticed in the wall region as compared to the 31% by the 
Zhang -Vanderheyden drag model . On the other hand, the Grace drag model underpredicted 
the gas velocity values in co mparison to the Ishii -Zuber model. The effect of Grace drag 
model was only studied for the homogenous regime. One such recent study that employs 
this drag model is carried out by Zhu et al.  (2020) . They have reported that when the lift 
model employed by Tomiyama et al.  (2002)  was employed, the Grace  et al.  (1976)  drag 
model outperformed the other drag closures in the prediction of liquid axial velocity 
profiles. The values of axial gas velocities were in close accordance when  the Grace  et al.  
(1976)   drag closure was combined with constant lift model. Lateral fluctuations of liquid 
velocity were underpredicted when this drag model was employed. In general, the 
combination of Grace  et al.  (1976)  drag model and constant lift force o utperformed rest of 
the combinations in determining the hydrodynamics. When this model was used in the 
determination of radial gas holdups, an accurate prediction has been reported.  
Ishii and Zuber (1979)  finds its application in modeling large bubble sizes  owing to its 
ability to model various bubble shapes like spherical, ellipsoidal and cap. In a study carried 39 
 
 out by Deen et al.  (2001) , the Ishii and Zuber (1979)  drag model was employed to simulate 
a rectangular bubble column reactor. When the drag model was enabled along with the lift 
force, the plume was spread across the column and the experimental trends were observed. 
It was noticed that this drag model outperformed when LES turbulence model was 
employed in comparison to the standard k-ε model . The numerical values of axial liquid 
velocities and turbule nt kinetic energies were in close agreement with the experimental 
results using the technique of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).  In another study carried 
out by Deen et al.  (2000) , the plume was seen to consistently move near the wall region 
resulting in asymmetric velocity profiles. In a study by Zhang et al.  (2006) , a comparison 
has been made between Tomiyama and Ishii -Zuber drag models. They have noticed that 
the Ishii -Zuber drag model closely estimates the average liquid axial velocities compared 
to the Tomiyama model in column s of shorter heights. However, the slip velocity was 
underpredicted by the Ishii -Zuber model in comparison to the Tomiyama drag model. In 
taller columns, a reverse trend was noticed i.e. Ishii -Zuber model underestimated the values 
of average liquid axial v elocities in comparison to the Tomiyama drag model.  
2.3.2.3  Transversal Lift Force  
The component of force subjected to the dispersed phase which is perpendicular to the 
velocity direction is termed as the traversal or lateral or lift force. In symmetric flows, th e 
symmetric bodies experience a zero lift force. The physical principle behind the lift forcing 
acting on a single spherical bubble can be divided into the Magnus and Saffman lift forces. 
The Magnus lift force arises from the bubble rotation which is a res ultant of asymmetric 
pressure distribution around the bubble (Swanson, 1961) . Over the last decades, numerous 
studies have been carried out to establish the origin of this force (Swanson, 1961; Svendsen 40 
 
 et al. , 1992; Tzeng et al. , 1993) . In his early study, Swanson (1961)  concluded that the 
traversal force acts in the less chaotic region (low speed) if the bubbles tends to move with 
the flow or faster than the flow. On the other hand, Saffman forces move th e non -rotating 
particle perpendicular to the flow direction when it is placed in a shear flow (Saffman, 
1965) . At lower Reynolds number, the Saffman force outweighs the Magnus force only if 
the rotating speed  of the dispersed phase is not large enough (Saffman, 1965) .  
Thomas et al.  (1983)  have derived an expression for the traverse force experienced by a 
spherical gas bubble which is given as:  
𝐹𝐿=𝜀𝐺𝜀𝐿𝜌𝐺𝐶𝐿(𝑈𝐺−𝑈𝐿)x(∇x𝑈𝐺)    (2.35)  
 
In modeling of bubble column reactor, lift force accounts for the effect of shearing motion 
of the continuous phase on the movement of the dispersed bubbles. Some studies have 
shown that it is possibility of neglecting the lift force formula tion to reduce computational 
time and cost (Chen  et al. , 2005; Xu et al. , 2013; Pourtousi et al. , 2015) . Nevertheless, it 
has been widely reported that adding the lift force formulation sp reads the bubbles evenly 
over the bubble column cross section  (Lain and Sommerfeld, 2004; Vanga et al. , 2004; 
Lucas et al. , 2005; Krepper et al. , 2007) . Also, the small bubble plume generated fr om the 
gas distributor is spread across the column cross section  (Vanga et al. , 2004 ).   
For the most part, the two types of lift force coefficients used in bubble column modelling 
are constant lift coefficient and lift coefficient based on the Reynolds number and Eotvos 
number of the dispersed phase. Over the years, numerous studies have empl oyed a wide 
range of lift force coefficients which sparks a need to delve deeper into the dynamics behind 41 
 
 the effective choice of this coefficient. Table 2. 2 illustrates the different lift coefficients 
that have been employed so far in modelling bubble col umn reactors. Table 2. 3 highlights 
the lift force formulations.

In their study, Drew and Lahey (1987)  demonstrated that the value of lift coefficient for an 
inviscid flow around a sphere is C L=0.5. Studies by Buwa and Ranade (2002)  and Zhang 42 
 
 et al.  (2006)  have confirmed this coefficient by implementing it in their model. Dhotre et 
al. (2009)  have recommended a positive value of lift coefficients between 0.1 and 0.5 in 
the bubbly flow regime. In their work, Tabib et al.  (2008)  have demonstrated the sensitivity 
of lift force coefficient to reach an effective numerical solution. In the bubbly flow regime, 
when the lift coefficients were switched from negative to positive valu es, a minimal 
deviation was noticed in the values of radial gas holdups and liquid axial velocities. 
However, in the heterogenous regime, the positive values of lift force coefficient decreased 
the centerline liquid axial velocity and flatter gas holdup pr ofiles were noticed. Hence, the 
lift coefficient based on the bubble size gave better predictions of hydrodynamic 
parameters.  
The sign of lift force coefficient adds to the already existing misperception surrounding its 
choice. A number of studies involvi ng bubble column reactors have reported a negative 
value of lift coefficient between -0.01 and -1.5 (Elena Díaz et al. , 2009) . The negative 
values of lift force coefficient tend to push the bubbles to regions of higher liquid velocities. 
In their work, Sankaranarayanan and Sundaresan (2002)  reported that the use of negative 
lift coefficients to obtain higher holdups in the central region cannot be accepted. To 
overcome this problem,  Tomiyama (1995)  and Tomiyama et al.  (2002)  have developed a 
lift model based on the Eotvos number which is in turn dependent on the bubble diameters.

According to the first correlation, the value and sign of the lift force coefficient depends 
on the bubble diameter. For bubbles of diameter greater than 9 mm dispersed in water, the 
lift coefficient takes a negative value. In a modification to the initial  correlation, Tomiyama 
et al.  (2002)  lift coefficient was developed. With this modified correlation, when the bubble 
diameters are less than or equal of 4 mm, the lift coefficient takes a negative value thereby 
pushing the small bubbles closer to the wall. Bubbles of larger diamete r are pushed towards 
the central region.  
2.3.2.4  Turbulence Dispersion Force  
The turbulent dispersion force is responsible for the effect of eddies formed by the 
continuous phase on the bubbles. This force is a resultant of the turbulent fluctuations of 
liquid ve locity. In bubble column reactor modeling, widely used turbulent dispersion 44 
 
 formulations are proposed by  de Bertodano (1991)  and Burns et al.  (2004) . A limited 
studies have employed the model proposed by Simonin et al.  (1990) . The radial gas holdup 
profiles are affected by the choice of turbulence dispersion force (Lucas et al. , 2007) . The 
turbulent dispersion force is responsible for pushing the bubbles away from the central 
region of the column when negative lift force coefficient is employed.  
In bubble columns, the values of coefficient of turbulent dispersion can range between 0 t o 
0.5 (Pourtousi et al. , 2014; Gaurav, 2018) . In a study by Tabib et al.  (2008) , three values 
of turbulent dispersion coefficients, 0, 0.2 and 0.5 have been employed for homogenous 
and heterogenous regimes. In the bubbly flow regime, the effect of turbulent dispersion 
was not ver y pronounced. It was noticed that at higher velocities, when the value of the 
turbulent dispersion coefficient was increased, the gas holdups became flatter. In another 
study by Silva et al.  (2012) , turbulent dispersion coefficients of 0.1 and 0.2 were used for 
superficial gas velocities of 0.02 and 0.08 m/s. They have reported a decrease in the gas 
velocity profile upon implementing the turbulent  dispersion force.  
In summary, for bubble columns, the turbulent dispersion coefficients are between 0.1 and 
0.5. For bubbly flows (U G< 5 cm/s), the  turbulent dispersion coefficient value could be 0.1. 
For transition regime (5<U G< 10 cm/s), the  turbulent dispersion coefficient value could be 
0.2. For churn -turbulent regimes (U G> 10 cm/s), the turbulent dispersion coefficient could 
be set to 0.3.

 2.4 CFD Studies on Bubble Column with Internals  
Lately, bubble columns reactors as multiphase contactors  are preferred for a wide range of 
industrial applications especially in the sectors of process, biochemical, metallurgical and 
petrochemical industries (Youssef and Al -Dahhan, 2009; Jhawar and Prakash, 2011; 
George et al. , 2017) . For specific applications such as Fischer -Tropsch and methanol 
synthesis, bubble column reactors are provided with internals that facilitate heat transfer 
and improve mixing characteristics (Youssef and Al -Dahhan, 2009; Abdulmohsin and Al -
Dahhan, 2012) . When innards are added in a bubble column, it adds complexity to the flow 
dynamics. Heretofore, several laboratory and pilot scale studies have investigated the 
effects of internals on the hydrodynamic pa rameters and fluid dynamics of bubble columns. 
However, there is a dearth in the number of numerical studies that have been executed on 
bubble column reactors with internals. Some of these studies have been tabulated in 
Appendix B.  
In one of the preliminar y numerical  studies on obstructed bubble columns, Larachi, F. et 
al. (2006) , have investigated the effect of different circular tube internals on hydrodynamic 
and turbulence parameters. They have studied the effect of two bubble sizes (5 mm and 19 
mm) on the flow patterns and hydrodynamics.  However, the numerical results were not 
validated with experimental data and it was noticed that the liquid behavior was not  in 
accordance with observations made in experiments (Guan et al. , 2014; Agahzamin and 
Pakzad, 2019) . In another numerical study performed by Laborde -Boutet et al.  (2010) , U-
shaped cooling tubes as internals within a bubble column reactor is simulated. Here, a 
suitable model that couples hydrodynamics and thermal phenomena has been investigated 
and the heat transfer coefficients obtained through the numerical approach has been 46 
 
 compared with experimental data. The authors have made use of only drag model as the 
interphase force and RNG k -ε per phase  formulation as the turbulence model. The authors 
have reported superior heat transfer rates at higher levels of turbulence.  
In their work, Guan and Yang (2017) ,  have presented the sensitivity of interfacial forces 
(including drag, lift, turbulent dispersion and wall lubrication) on hydrodynamic 
parameters within a bubble c olumn reactor occluded with internal rods. The right choice 
of lateral forces were deemed necessary to accurately predict the flow when internals are 
present. When lift force was considered, the liquid velocities and gas holdups steepened by 
a considerable  amount. By adding the turbulent dispersion force, large -scale liquid 
recirculations were noticed. In presence of the wall lubrication effect, the gas holdups 
decreased in the  vicinity of internal rods and increased beyond physical sense in its 
absence.  
Bhusare et al.  (2018)  have simulated the liquid phase mixing and hydr odynamic parameters 
in a co -current upflow bubble column. They have employed two configurations of internal 
rods: (1) column with one vertical rod at the center (2) column with the same rod at the 
center and four vertical rods in the bulk region. The autho rs have reported that the 
turbulence induced by the internals increases the eddy diffusivity values. Also, a significant 
improvement in the mixing quality was noticed in the presence of internals as compared to 
hollow bubble columns. This was due to the in crease in axial dispersion coefficients which 
in turn influences the mixing patterns. The numerical data was compared with experimental 
measurements.  47 
 
 In one of the recent studies presented by Agahzamin and Pakzad  (2019) , the impact of dense 
vertical internals on bubb le column hydrodynamics and turbulence parameters has been 
investigated. The study was performed with three sets of circular rod internal 
configurations. They have reported a significant increase in gas holdup values, superior 
liquid recirculation and high er gas velocities as a general consequence of the presence of 
internals. By increasing the pitch of the tube layout, flatter velocity distributions and gas 
holdups were noticed. A narrow bubble size distribution was noticed in the presence of 
internals in comparison to the hollow bubble column.  
2.5 Concluding Remarks  
The above  comprehensive review on numerical simulations of  bubble column 
hydrodynamics shows that  many  studies have addressed the influence of various flow, 
turbulence and interfacial forces m odels on bubble column hydrodynamics., There is 
however, a lack of coherent and systematic approach to cover the applicable effects in 
different flow regimes for the purpose of scale and other practical implementation of  
simulation results.

(Duduković, Larachi and Mills, 2002; Li et al. , 2003; Ni et al. , 2006; Shaikh and Al -
Dahhan, 2013; Joseph, 2016; George, Jhawar and Prakash, 2017; Valero et al. , 2019) . 
Bubble column reactors  have  many advantages that are  associated with their operation s 
and design s. Very high degree of mixing  can be achieved in these reactors, which enhances 
the heat and mass transfer rates (Chen, Kemoun, et al. , 1999; Besagni, Inzoli and 
Ziegenhein, 2018)  
Although bubble columns have distinct and various applications, their  size-dependent 
hydrodynamic interactions make it challenging to scale up from lab and pilot scale to 
industrial scale reactors. The information on flow patterns within the column, local and 
global gas holdups, turbulence parameters, local velocities for t he liquid and gaseous 
phases and bubble size distribution is vital to analyze bubble columns. The term hollow 
bubble column is used when there is no internal except a gas distributor near the column 
bottom.  60 
 
 Although simple in construction, their scale -up and sizing have proven to be really 
challenging due to their complex hydrodynamics and mixing effects, which vary with scale 
and operating flow regimes. Over the last few decades, a considerable progress has been 
achieved in the field of Computational Flui d Dynamics (CFD), a powerful and effective 
numerical tool that is used to simulate a wide range of multiphase flow systems. Although 
a number of studies on CFD based simulation of bubble column hydrodynamics have 
reported, there is a lack of systematic and  coherent approach for proper selection of phase 
interaction parameters and turbulence models.  Therefore, the objectives of this study are:  
- To carry out numerical simulations of two -phase flows in a bubble column under 
different operating regimes.  
- To inve stigate the effect of various phase interaction parameters on the numerical 
results and compare the numerical results with available experimental data from 
literatures to select suitable phase interaction parameters.  
The simulations are carried out using A NSYS Fluent v19.2, which is one of the widely 
used commercial CFD packages. 2 -D planar simulations are carried using the Eulerian -
Eulerian multiphase model. The interfacial forces including drag, lift, turbulent dispersion, 
turbulent interaction and added mass are included in  the multiphase CFD model. The effect 
of different drag force models, such as the models by Schiller and Naumann  (Schiller, 
1933) , Grace et al. (Grace, TH and others, 1976) , Tomiyama (Tomiyama, 1998)  and Ishii -
Zuber (Ishii and Zuber, 1979) , are investigated and the numerical re sults are compared with 
the experimental data.  Different lift force models, the constant lift force model with 
varying coefficients of positive and negative lift force coefficients, Tomiyama (Tomiyama 61 
 
 et al. , 2002)  and Saffman -Mei (Saffman, 1965) , are also  assessed and valida ted. Turbulent 
dispersion models, such as the model by Simonin and Viollet (Simonin, Viollet and others, 
1990)  with varying coefficients of turbulent dispersion coefficients and the model by Burns 
et al. (Burns et al. , 2004) , are examined. The simulation results with and without the bubble 
induced turbulence model are compared. The sensitivity of the interfacial forces on the 
two-phase flows in the bubble column reactors are studied extensively in the current work.  
After the comparison and validation, the most accurate interfacial forces are  used to carry 
out the flow regime transition studies at superficial gas velocities of 4 cm/s, 10 cm/s and 
30 cm/s, respectively. The effect of the superficial gas velocity on hydrodynamic 
parameters such as radial gas holdups, liquid axial velocities, gl obal gas holdups, centerline 
liquid axial velocities and bubble size distributions is investigated and compared with 
numerous experimental data from literatures.

3.2.2  Interfacial forces  
Interfacial forces play a major role in the computational modelling of multiphase flows. 
Various interfacial forces including drag, lift, added virtual mass, turbulent dispersion and 
turbulent interaction forces need to be considered for multiphase flows (Lopez et al., 2004; 
Nguyen et al. , 2013; Colombo and Fairweather, 2020) . These have been illustrated in 
Figure 3.1.  The drag force, known as the chief force, involved in the bubble column reactor 
modelling,  has been widely studied (Kulkarni, 2008; Tabib, Roy and Joshi, 2008; Kannan 
et al. , 2019) . The effect of other interfacial forces is not very pronounced in the literature 63 
 
 and very few studies have been done on the combined effect of these forces. Including 
appropriate interfacial forces will lead to a more accurate prediction of hydrodynamic 
parameters in multiphase flow systems.

3.2.2.1  Virtual mass force  
In multiphase flows, the effect of the virtual mass force is expected when a dispersed phase 
accelerates with respect to the stationary phase (ANSYS, 2013; Dhotre et al., 2008) . In 
bubble column reactors, the virt ual mass force is exerted by the action of bubbles 
64 
 
 accelerating through the liquid phase. The influence of added mass force is prominent in 
the case of transient flows involved in a bubble column reactor due to the significant 
difference in densities betwe en liquid and gas phases (ANSYS, 2013) .  
The added mass force is characterized by:  
𝐹⃗𝑣𝑚,𝑙=𝜀𝑔𝜌𝑙
2 (𝑑𝑔
𝑑𝑡 𝑢⃗⃗𝑔−𝑑𝑙
𝑑𝑡 𝑢⃗⃗𝑙)     (3.6)  
𝐹⃗𝑣𝑚,𝑙=𝜀𝑔𝜌𝑙𝐶𝑉𝑀(𝑑𝑔
𝑑𝑡 𝑢⃗⃗𝑔−𝑑𝑙
𝑑𝑡 𝑢⃗⃗𝑙)    (3.7)  
The derivatives present (𝑑𝑔
𝑑𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑑𝑙
𝑑𝑡)in the Equations 3.6 and 3.7 are in the phase material 
time form.   
In several studies, t he virtual mass effect was neglected (Chen & Fan, 2004; Tabib et al., 
2008) . In some other studies, the virtual mass coefficient was maintained at 𝐶𝑉𝑀=0.5, 
which is the prescribed value for spherical shaped bubbles. The study  conducted by Gupta 
and Roy (2013) for rectangular bubble columns showed that the effect of virtual mass was 
apparent in the bulk region of the column and was negligible at the column wa lls. They 
indicated that the incorporation of virtual mass effect in the numerical study increases the 
time required for the convergence (Gupta and Roy, 2013) .  
In the current work, the value of virtual mass coefficient for spherical shaped bubbles is set 
at 𝐶𝑉𝑀=0.5. The virtual mass force plays an important role in reaching the stability at 
early stages of the flow within a bubble column reactor. When the virtual mass force is 
included  in the numerical simulation , bubbles accelerations through the liquid column are 65 
 
 limite d. Once the simulation reaches the pseudo -steady state, the influence of virtual mass 
force is insignificant  as indicated by Smith (1998 ) and  Dhotre et al.  (2008) . 
3.2.2.2  Drag Force  
The drag force is the resistance experienced by the bubbles rising through the column of 
liquid. The drag force could be a combination of two types of resistances including skin 
friction and form drag. The influence of the drag force on two -phase flow in b ubble 
columns is stronger than other interfacial forces, such as turbulent dispersion, lift, virtual 
mass and turbulent interaction forces. The axial velocities and overall holdups of gas phase 
within the bubble column are strongly affected by the drag mod el used in the simulation. 
It is an important parameter as it determines the terminal velocity and residence time of 
bubbles  (Yang et al. , 2018) . 
Yang et al. (2018) studied the influence of drag force on the bubble swarms as it is quite 
different from single bubbles. The rise velocities of bubble swarms are not th e same as that 
of the single bubble since the drag coefficients and terminal velocities are different between 
bubble swarms and single bubble. Complex bubble interactions associated with the bubble 
swarms is another factor that affects the drag coefficient s.  
The drag force between the gas and liquid phase is described as:  
𝐹𝐷,𝑙=0.75𝜀𝑙𝜌𝑙𝐶𝐷
𝑑𝑏 |𝑢𝑔−𝑢𝑙|(𝑢𝑔−𝑢𝑙)     (3.8)  
The drag coefficient,  𝐶𝐷, is a function of liquid properties, hydrodynamic interaction 
between the bubbles and flow regimes . In the current study, the drag model proposed by 66 
 
 Schiller and Naumann (Schiller, 1933)  is used. The drag coefficient in the Schiller and 
Naumann drag force model is described as  
𝐶𝑑={24 (1+0.15 𝑁𝑅𝑒0.687)
𝑁𝑅𝑒,𝑁𝑅𝑒≤1000
0.24,                             𝑁𝑅𝑒>1000    (3.9) 
The Reynolds Number ( Re) associated with this drag coefficient  is  determined using the 
effective bubble diameter, slip velocity between the two phases, liquid properties such as 
dynamic viscosity and densi ty (Law  et al. , 2008; Xu et al. , 2013) .  
𝑅𝑒=𝜌𝑙|𝑣𝑙⃗⃗⃗⃗−𝑣𝑔⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗|𝑑𝑏
𝜇𝑙     (3.10) 
The Schiller Naumann drag force model is well suited for gas -liquid flows in the bubbly 
flow regime since the superficial gas velocities are below 5 cm/s  (Pourtousi, Sahu  and 
Ganesan, 2014) . This drag model does not account for the shape factor of the bubbles as 
the Eotvos number is absent in the drag force formulation. The hydrodynamics of the two -
phase flows is well captured in the current drag model as it takes the Reynolds number into 
consideration, which in turn is a function of bubble diameter.  
3.2.2.3  Lift Force  
The influence of shearing force experienced by gas bubbles in a liquid medium is modelled  
by the lift force (Drew and Lahey Jr, 1987; Žun, 1990) . This force acts perpendicular to the 
flow direction. The lift force comprises of two mechanisms, namely the Magnus and 
Saffman forces. The first one is due to the bubble’s rotation and the second one is due to 
the shear produced around the bubble. Drew and Lahey (1987) proposed the general form 
of the lift force and it depends directly on the curl of gas phase velocity and the difference 
between the velocity of the two phases (slip velocity) .  67 
 
 𝐹⃗𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑡=−𝐶𝐿𝜀𝑔𝜌𝑙𝐶𝐷
𝑑𝑏 (𝑢⃗⃗𝑔−𝑢⃗⃗𝑙)×(∇×𝑢⃗⃗𝑔)    (3.11) 
One of the widely used lift coefficients was proposed by Tomiyama (1998), which depends 
on the Eotvos number. So, the lift coefficient is negative when the bubble diameters exceed 
0.56 cm a nd positive when the bubble diameters are less than 0.56 cm (Dhotre  et al. , 2008) .  
Several researchers utilized a positive lift force coefficient (Tabib, Roy and Joshi, 2008) .  
Tabib et al. (2008) compared the effect of the positive and ne gative lift force coefficients 
on the liquid axial velocities and the radial holdups within a bubble column. At lower 
superficial gas velocities, the effect of the lift coefficient sign from positive to negative was 
minimal while significant deviation was noticed at higher gas velocities. They explained 
that when the lift force coefficient is positive , the bubbles move from the center towards 
the column wall. This leads to the decrease in centerline liquid axial velocities and 
flattening of gas holdup profi les. Hence, the choice of the lift force coefficient depends on 
the bubble diameters which in turn depends on the flow regime. Similarly, Dhotre et al., 
(2009) also argued that the constant lift force coefficient with values in the range 0.1 -0.5 
can be use d only in the bubbly flow regime.  
Guan and Yang (2017) asserted that the effect of the lift force is more pronounced in the 
presence of internals. Their findings agreed with those made by Tabib et al. (2008). When 
a negative lift coefficient of -0.02 was used, the centerline liquid velocities reportedly 
increased by 138% in the case of internals and 20.5% in the case of hollow bubble columns 
(Guan and Yang, 2017) . Also, an increase in the steepness of the gas holdup and liquid 
velocity profiles was noticed. In the current study, the numerical results  using different lift 
force models are compared.  68 
 
 3.2.2.4  Turbulence Dispersion  
In a transient system like bubble columns, turbulent dispersion force exists when the gas 
holdup fluctuates due to the continuous fluctuations in the liquid velocity. The turbulent 
dispersion force accounts for the influence of turbulent eddies in the continuous phase 
(Dhotre & Smith, 2007; Miao et al., 2013; Pourtou si et al., 2014) . Smith (1998) explained 
that the turbulent dispersion force is responsible for the correct spreading of plume within 
the column.  
In bubble column reactor modelling, the turbulent dispersion model proposed by Lopez de 
Bertodano and Burn s et al. (2004) has been commonly employed (Krepper, Frank, et al. , 
2007; Frank et al. , 2008; Li, Yang and Dai, 2009; Duan et al. , 2011; Silva, d’Ávila and 
Mori, 2012; Miao et al. , 2013) . The range of coefficient of turbulent dispersion ( 𝐶𝑇𝐷) is 
between 0.1 and 0.5. Guan and Yang (2017) investigated the impact of the turbulence 
dispersion force on hydrodynamics in the presence internals. They used a  𝐶𝑇𝐷 = 0.3 and 
found that the turbulent dispersion force tends to increase and flatten the gas holdup profile. 
In the presence of vertical internals, enhanced liquid circulations were noticed due to the 
increase in gas holdups in the bulk of the cylindrical column. Li et al. ( 2009)  reported that 
phase holdups  and liquid axial velocity were accurately predicted using 𝐶𝑇𝐷 = 0.2. Tabib 
et al.  (2008)  used  𝐶𝑇𝐷 = 0.2 and found that the influence  of turbulence dispersion was less 
pronounced in case of lower superficial gas velocities as compared to higher gas velocities . 
In this work,  the simulations using the turbulent dispersion models proposed by Simonin  
et al. ( 1990)  and Burns et al. (2004) are carried out and the results are validated against the 69 
 
 experimental data. Based on the study by Mudde and Simonin (1999) , the model by 
Simonin  et al. ( 1990)  is selected to calculate t he drift velocity, as shown below.  
𝑣⃗𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑓𝑡 =−𝐷𝑇𝐷,𝑔𝑙 (∇𝜀𝑔

where, 𝐷𝑇𝐷,𝑔𝑙 is the tensor which accounts for fluid -particulate dispersion.  
𝐷𝑇𝐷,𝑔𝑙=𝑘𝑔𝑙𝜏𝑇𝐷,𝑔𝑙
3     (3.13) 
Here, 𝑘𝑔𝑙 is the covariance of the ve locities of liquid phase and the gas phase. The 
turbulent dispersion for gas -liquid flows can be described as  
𝐹⃗𝑇𝐷,𝑙=−𝐹⃗𝑇𝐷,𝑔=𝐶𝑇𝐷𝑘𝑔𝑙𝐷𝑇𝐷,𝑔𝑙
𝜎𝑔𝑙 (∇𝜀𝑙
𝜀𝑙−∇𝜀𝑔
𝜀𝑔)    (3.14) 
where 𝐶𝑇𝐷 is the coefficient of turbulent  dispersion and 𝜎𝑔𝑙 is the dispersion Prandtl 
number between the gas and liquid phase.  
3.2.2.5  Bubble Induced Turbulence  
The turbulent modelling in bubble column reactors using Reynolds averaged equations is 
based on Boussinesq approximations (Sokolichin, Eigenberger and Lapin, 2004; 
Coughtrie, Borman and Sleigh, 2013; Vaidheeswaran and Hibiki, 2017; Shi, X. Yang, et 
al., 2020) . Nevertheless , the presence of bubbles adds to the complexity of the problem. In 
modelling bubble column reactors, the turbulence is a blend of both, the liquid turbulence 
(shear turbulence) and turbulence induced by bubbles (Shi et al. , 2019) . The latter is 
constituted by the bubble wake generated as a result of shed vortices from the surface of 70 
 
 bubbles. The wake decays rapidly due to the effect of viscous dissipation. The bubble 
induced turbulence is anisotropic in nature and hence, the Boussinesq approximation s of 
isotropic turbulent eddy viscosity may not be accurate to model the Reynolds stresses. 
Therefore, the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) is employed in the current study.  
3.2.3  Population Balance Model  
The knowledge of bubble behavior within bubble columns and ot her applications has 
gained increasing importance in recent years (Mudde, Groen and Van Den Akker, 1997; 
Luo et al. , 1999; Gandhi et al. , 2007; Nedeltchev, Shaikh and Al -Dahhan, 2011) . It is useful 
in identifying the transitions between the homogenous and heterogenous flow regimes due 
to the  change in bubble sizes. The predictions of terminal rise velocities and gas holdups 
depend on the bubble dynamics. Industrial multiphase reactors prefer heterogenous regime 
due to the wide distribution of bubble sizes. The Population Balance Model (PBM) i s a 
useful tool in the prediction of bubble size distributions (Wang, 2011) . CFD has been 
coupled with PBM to model the bubble break -up and coalescence to determine the bubble 
size distribution.  
The change in bubble size distribution can be determined by the Population Balance 
Equations (PBEs). This is an integro -differential equation which comprises of the bubble 
breakup and coalescence kernels. Kumar an d Ramkrishna (1996)  developed the discrete 
method to solve this equation, in which the bubble sizes were discretized into a finite 
number of classes or intervals. Each interval is assigned a pivot size, 𝑥𝑖. The integro -
differential equation is integra ted over each class or interval and redistributed for each pivot 
size. 71

where 𝑁𝑖 is the bubble number in the ith subregion and 𝜂𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 and 𝜁𝑖,𝑘  are the distribution 
coefficients which describe the bubble coalescence and bubble breakup, respectively . The 
homogenous discrete PBM assumes same phase velocities acr oss all bins.  
3.2.3.1  Bubble Coalescence Model  
Bubble coalescence in gas -liquid systems has three key mechanisms – coalescence due to 
wake entrainment, difference in bubble rise velocities and turbulent eddies (Prince and 
Blanch, 1990) . In a typical turbulent flow, the bubble coalescence takes place in 3 steps. 
Initially, the collision amid bubbles lead to liquid confinement between them. This is 
followed by draining of the confined liquid which allows the liquid film separating the two  
bubbles to reach a critical thickness. Finally, the liquid film ruptures which leads to 
coalescence between the two bubbles. The bubble coalescence due to turbulent eddies is 
the main mechanism noticed in bubble column reactors working in the bubbly and 
transition regimes. When the bubble columns operate in the churn turbulent regimes where 
the bubble size distribution is wide, the bubble coalescence is dominated by the wake 
entrainment effect. This effect is crucial in the formation of large bubbles in th e transition 
and churn turbulent regime. The bubble coalescence due to the difference in bubble rise 
velocities is negligible as the rise velocity is directly dependent on the bubble size.  73 
 
 The rate of bubble coalescence between two bubbles, 𝑖 and 𝑗,  with diameters  𝑑𝑖 and 𝑑𝑗, 
can be evaluated as a product of collision frequency ( 𝜔𝑐) and coalescence probability 
leading from collision ( 𝑃𝑐):  
𝑐(𝑑𝑖,𝑑𝑗)=𝜔𝑐(𝑑𝑖,𝑑𝑗).𝑃𝑐(𝑑𝑖,𝑑𝑗)   (3.17) 
3.2.3.2  Bubble Breakup Model  
Bubble breakup mechanisms include vis cous shear, interfacial instability and local 
turbulence (Lee, Erickson and Glasgow, 1987; Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii, 199 5; Liovic 
and Lakehal, 2007; Liao and Lucas, 2009; Chu et al. , 2019) . The bubble breakup model 
proposed by  Luo and Svendsen (1996)  accou nts for binary disintegration of bubbles due to 
collisions and turbulent fluctuations. This theoretical model is based on the kinetic gas 
theory for drop and breakup of bubbles in turbulent flows (Luo and Svendsen, 1996; 
Gaurav, 2018) . Turbulent kinetic energy of the colliding eddy is  a key factor in determining 
the bubble size distribution. The turbulent kinetic energy must be greater than a critical 
value which corresponds to the surplus in the value of surface energy before and after the 
process of breakup. Critical value is calcula ted by a model proposed by Prince and Blanch 
(1990) . Therefore, an apt choice of turbulence model is necessary to suitably model the 
breakup rate.  
3.2.4  Turbulence Model  
In bubble column reactor modelling, the turbulence model plays an important role. In 
several studies carried out over several years, various turbulence models such as standard 
𝑘−𝜀, RNG 𝑘−𝜀, RANS and LES, were used extensively to study the bubble columns.  74 
 
 Dhotre  et al. ( 2008)  compared the effect of  𝑘−𝜀 and LES turbulence models on the bubble 
flow characteristics. Both the turbulence models reportedly gave a good agreement for the 
liquid and gas axial velocities at various axial p ositions  when compared with the 
experimental data.  Near the gas sparger, the gas holdup, and liquid and gas velocities 
predicted by both models were in close agreements to the experimental data. However, the 
LES model overpredicted the turbulent kinetic en ergy near the injector.  The deviations in 
turbulent kinetic energy predictions could be attributed to the mechanisms used to 
determine the energy interactions between the mean flow and the large scale, and the 
energy cascading from large scale to small sca le (Tabib, Roy and Joshi, 2008) . In 
conclusion, the 𝑘−𝜀  model incorporated with additional interphase force terms required 
less computational times and provided a good agreement with the experimental data.  
A study conducted by Tabib et al.  (2008)  compared the effect of 𝑘−𝜀, RSM and LES 
models on bubble column hydrodynamics. The axial profiles of the liquid velocity were 
well predicted by the RSM and LES models in compa rison to the 𝑘−𝜀 model. Turbulent 
kinetic energy profiles predicted by the LES and RSM models were close to the 
experimental values. The pressure strain mechanism engrained in the RSM modelling helps 
in the redistribution of turbulent kinetic energy at v arious components for accurate 
predictions. In contrast, the poor prediction of turbulent kinetic energy profiles by the 𝑘−
𝜀 model is due to the isotropic assumption which leads to ineffective redistribution of 
energy. Their study concluded that the inhe rent mechanism of anisotropic energy transfer 
in RSM model outperformed the 𝑘−𝜀 model.  75 
 
 In the current study, RSM model is employed to model the turbulence within the bubble 
column reactor . In the RSM turbulence model, five transport equations are solved  for 2 -D 
flows to obtain the Reynolds stresses. The equations for the RSM turbulence model are 
illustrated as:

3.3 Configuration of the column  
The numerical modelling is based on the pilot -scale bubble column reactor (Jhawar and 
Prakash, 2014)  as shown in Figure 3. 2 . The experiments were carried out in a Plexiglas 
column of height 2.5 m and diameter 0.1 5 m. The column was equipped with a coarse 76 
 
 sparger, through which the secondary phase was introduced. In the experiments, tap water 
and compressed air were used as primary and secondary sources, respectively. The 
experiments were carried out at different s uperficial gas velocities ranging from 3 cm/s to 
35 cm/s. The static height of the liquid was maintained at 1.45 m throughout the 
experimental run. The experimental data is used to validate the numerical results in this 
study.

 3.4 Numerical Method  
A 2-dimenisonal uniform structured mesh is developed using ICEM CFD 17.0. The grid 
independence tests are carried out. The node counts are outlined in Table 3.3. Medium 
mesh is shown in Figure 3. 3. Overall gas holdups at a superficial gas velocity of 0.04 m/s 
obtained for the coarse and medium meshes are 0.66 and 0.075, respectively. Sub sequently, 
centerline liquid velocities at a superficial gas velocity of 0.04 m/s obtained for the medium

The numerical simulations of hollow bubble column reactors are carried out using ANSYS 
Fluent v19.2. The geometries utilized are of the 2 -Dimenional planar type. The simulations 
are carried out for water -air two -phase flow system and an incompressible method 
(pressure -based solver) is utilized to solve the governing equations. The Reynolds Stress 
Model (RSM) turbulence model with dispersed formulation is used in the current study 
since it is able to accurately pr edict the turbulent kinetic energy, which is a key parameter 
in the bubble column modelling. Water and air were selected as the primary phase and 
secondary phase respectively. The simulations are carried out in the bubbly regime (U G=4 
cm/s), transition reg ime (U G=10 cm/s) and churn turbulent regime (U G=30 cm/s). The

 simulations are performed with and without the PBM and to  investigate the effect of the 
PBM on the  column  hydrodynamics . 
The spatial variables are discretized by Green -Gauss Cell based method. The phase -
coupled SIMPLE method is used for  the pressure -velocity coupling.  The momentum and 
volume fraction equations are solved using the QUICK scheme and second order upwind 
schem e is used to solve the turbulence equations and gas bin fractions. The convergence 
criterion is set to 10-3 for all transport equations. The initial time step is set to 0.0001 s for 
the first 3 seconds of flow time and is then increased to 0.0005 s and 0.0 01 s after 8 seconds 
and 15 seconds , respectively to avert numerical divergence. The flow simulation s are  
carried out for 200 s .  The results are time averag ed after a quasi -steady state has been 
achieved. The quasi -steady state is achieved after 30 second s. Hence, the simulation results 
are averaged for about 170 s.  The numerical models used in the current work is listed in

At the inlet, the superficial gas velocity and volume fraction of the gas phase along with 
the initial bin fractions are specified. Very  few researchers have explicitly mentioned their 
choice of turbulent quantities for the liquid phase at the inlet of the bubble column. This 
makes it a great challenge to gather the turbulence specification data for gas -liquid flows. 
In a recent study by Magolan et al.  (2019) , the turbulence intensity of 0.1 and turbulent 81 
 
 viscosity ratio of 100 were used. In another study carried out by Nygren (2014) , the 
turbulent intensity was set at 10% and hydraulic diameter was set to 4 mm which was 
calculated based on the rectangular duct geometry. In this study, the turbulent intensi ty of 
5% and hydraulic diameter of 0.15 m, which is the equivalent diameter of the bubble 
column reactor, are applied. The outflow is used as the outlet boundary condition  as it 
extends the inclusion of freeboard region of discontinuous phase on top of the  continuous 
phase.  
3.5 Results  and Discussion  
In this section, the numerical results are categorized in two parts. First, the effects of the 
PBM and the interfacial forces on reactor hydrodynamics are discussed. Next the 
hydrodynamics and shear stress in the column with flow regime transitions are presented.  
3.5.1  Influence of interfacial forces  
The choice of appropriate interfacial force models is crucial in the prediction of flow 
patterns and reactor hydrodynamics. Therefore, the influence of various drag forc e models, 
lift models, turbulent dispersion models, turbulence interaction model and wall lubrication 
force models are presented in this section.  
3.5.1.1  Influence of  the lift force model  
In this section, the effect of lift force from different models on the simu lation results is 
investigated in the transition regime (10 cm/s). Table 3.3 presents the lift coefficients from 
different models and the centerline liquid velocities and global gas holdups from different 
lift coefficients. Figure 3.5 shows the influence o f the lift force models on the liquid axial 
velocity profiles. If the lift force is neglected, the centerline liquid velocity is  much lower 82 
 
 (149% lower) than that from the experimental data from Hills (1974) . When a positive lift 
coefficient is used, an increase in U L0 is noticed. For the lift coefficients of 0.08 and 0.02,  
UL0 increases about 0.6% and 22%, respectively, in comparison to the case without the lift 
force.  When the lift coefficient  is positive, the gas bubbles tend to disperse from the central 
region and get pushed towards the reactor walls, which lowers the  value of centerline liquid 
velocity . The use of a negative lift coefficient leads to a significant increase in the centerline 
liquid velocity. The negative lift force coefficient is for the bubbles of diameter greater 
than 5.6 mm, so the bubbles tend to rise through the central region. Out of the three negative 
lift coefficients tested, C L= -0.08 gives the best agreement with the  experimental date from 
Hills (1974) . 
The Tomiyama lift force model depends on the Eotvos number and the the sign of lift 
coefficient will change based on bubble diameters. But, when The Tomiyama lift model is 
employed, the peak velocity is shifted towards the left wall, which is different from the 
velocity profiles predicted from other models where the peak velocity is at the center of the 
column. When the Saffman -Mei lift model is employed, the c enterline liquid velocity  is 
drastically reduced by about 4 51% compared with the experimental value (Hills, 1974) . 
This is because the Saffman -Mei model is the spherical bubbles only, i.e.  the shape factor 
is not included in the model. As the investigation is carried out in the transition regime, 
which comprises of a variety of bubble sizes and s hapes, Saffman -Mei lift model cannot 
predict the axial velocities accurately.

Figure 3.5 Comparison  of liquid axial velocities along the radial direction from different 
lift fore models in the transition regime (Ug=10 cm/s)  
The comparison of the  gas holdup profiles along the radial direction using different lift 
force models is shown in Figure 3.6. Compared with the experimental d ate, it can be seen 
that the lift force models proposed by Tomiyama (1998)  and Mei (1992)  cannot predict a 
correct gas holdup profile along the radial direction.  The gas  holdup predicted by the 
Tomiyama model is much lower than the experimental data. On the other hand, the 
Saffman -Mei lift model gives a flat gas holdup profile, which is different from that 
observed in the experiment. It is found that the constant lift force coefficient gives a -0.4-0.200.20.40.6

 relatively good agreement with the experimental data for the gas holdup. The gas holdup 
is slightly underpredicted if the lift force is neglected. The same trend is observed when a 
positive lift coefficient is used. The gas b ubbles shift away from the bulk region  when a 
positive lift coefficient is used, which  leads to a lower gas holdup in the central region 
(r/R=0). In contrast, when a negative lift coefficient is used, the gas holdup at the central 
region is slightly higher . It has been pointed out in literatures that when the diameter of air 
bubbles exceeds 9 mm, a negative lift coefficient will result in the symmetric wake 
associated with the bubble deformation (Sokolichin  et al., 2004) . The gas holdup predicted 
by the negative coefficient, C L=-0.08, agrees with the experimental data from Hills (1974) .

 3.5.1.2  Influence of bubble induced turbulence  
Bubble induced turbulence (BIT) is the pseudo -turbulence stimulated by the bubbles when 
rising through the column (Shi et al. , 2019) , which  is crucial to accurately predict the 
bubble size distribution within the reactor. In this study, the simulations with and without 
the BIT are carried to investigate the effect of the BIT on the velocity and gas holdup 
distributions. The BIT model proposed by Troshko and Hassan  (2001)  is used for 
simulations when the BIT is included. Figures 3.7 and 3.8 prese nt the influence of the BIT 
on local gas holdups and liquid axial velocities. When the BIT is neglected, the gas holdups 
and liquid axial velocity profiles along the radial direction are not symmetric about the 
central axis, which is generally not the case  in experiments. However, the central peak is 
observed when the BIT is included in the simulation, which  is similar to that from 
experimental observations.

Contour profiles of liquid axial velocities and gas holdups are illustrated in Figures 3.9 and 
3.10, respectively. When the BIT is included, a maximum axial velocity of 0.41 m/s is 
observed in the central region of the bubble column reactor. In contrast, without the BIT, 
the maximum axial  velocity is not at the central region. Similar observations can be seen 
for gas holdup contours with and without the BIT. The gas profiles are smooth in the bulk 
region of the column if the BIT is included. It is noticed that the liquid level in the colum n 
is below the static height (y=1.4 m) if the BIT is neglected, which is signified by the 
increase in gas volume fraction.  -0.6-0.4-0.200.20.40.6

 The vector profiles also indicate the difference in the flow patterns with and without the 
BIT as shown in Figures 3.11 – 3.13. In the distributor region (Figure 3.11), similar flow 
patterns are noticed in both cases. However, a stronger recirculation in the central region 
is noticed in the case with the BIT, which is in accordance with the experimentally observed 
flow patterns. In the bulk region (Figure 3.12), smooth flow profiles are noticed with the 
BIT model. Without the BIT, the flow direction seems to be skewed to one o f the sides, i.e. 
an asymmetric pattern, which is not usual observed in experiments. Also, in the central 
region, a maximum gas velocity of 1.4 m/s is observed without the BIT and 0.60 m/s with 
the BIT. The latter is close to the experimental data at a sup erficial gas velocity of 10 cm/s. 
In the disengagement zone (Figure 3.13), funneling pattern is clearly observed when the 
BIT is included in the simulation. Without BIT, the direction of fluid flow is reversed in 
the disengagement zone and the funneling ef fect disappears.

 3.5.1.3  Influence of turbulence dispersion force  
To investigate the sensitivity of the bubble column modelling to the turbulent dispersion 
force (TDF), two types of turbulent dispersion models, namely Simonin (C TD=0.1, 0.3 and 
0.5) (Simonin et al. , 1990)  and Burns et al. (C TD= 0.3) ( Burns et al. , 2004) ), are used. For 
the case without the TDF, the gas plume rises through the central region of the bubble 
column with a higher gas  holdup peak than the cases without the TDF, as  seen in Figure 
3.14. Also, a rapid decline is noti ced in the gas holdup away from the central region, which 
is not observed experimentally. The centerline liquid axial velocity as  illustrated in Figure 
3.15is higher without the TDF than the cases with the TDF. This is attributed to the rapid 
rise of bubbl es through the central region when the TDF is neglected. However, when the 
TDF is included, the gas plume is dispersed throughout the bulk region of the column, 
which leads to lower  centerline liquid axial velocities due the effective bubble dispersion 
in the liquid. The gas holdup profiles tend to be flattened due to the effect of bubble plume 
dispersion.  92 
 
  
Figure 3.14 Comparison of the gas holdups with and without the TDF in the transition 
regime (UG=10 cm/s)  
The simulations carried out using the turbulent dispersion model proposed by Simonin et 
al. (1990)  yield liquid axial velocities and  gas holdup profiles closer to the experimental 
data. The influence of turbulent dispersion coefficient (C TD=0.1, 0.3 and 0.5) on the gas -
liquid flow is also examined. The cent erline liquid axial velocities decrease considerably 
when the value of turbulent dispersion coefficient increases. The predictions made by using 
the coefficient, C TD=0.3, gives the best agreement with the experimental data for the liquid 
axial velocity , as seen in Figure 3.15 . The axial velocities and phase holdup obtained using 
the turbulent dispersion model by Burns et al.  (2004)  have non -symmetrical profiles, and 
the maximum liquid axial velocity is 0.6 m/s, which is c lose to the velocity in the wall 
region instead of the bulk region. The local gas holdup profile from the Burns model is also 
skewed towards the wall region due to the orientation of the gas plume.  00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.45

Based on the comparison of the liquid axial velocity contours (Figure 3.16), the influence 
of the TDF on the liquid an d gas phases can be clearly seen. From the liquid velocity 
contours, the maximum liquid velocity of 0. 7 m/s is in the central region in the case without 
the TDF. When using the TDF model from Burns et al.  (2004) , the ma ximum and minimum 
liquid velocities of 0.6 m/s (upward) and -0.3 m/s (downward) are observed close to the 
wall region which is not in accordance to the experimental observations. A clear distinction 
is noticed in the liquid velocity when the coefficients o f turbulent dispersion is differed. -0.5-0.3-0.10.10.30.50.7

From radial gas holdup contours (Figure 3.17), it c an be seen that the gas dispersion in the 
column is very minimal  in the case without the TDF. The gas plume is concentrated at the 
central region of the column and no dispersion is observed in the bulk region close to the 
column walls.  On using the turbul ent dispersion model proposed by (Burns et al. , 2004)  
(CTD=0.1), the gas plume is oriented from one column wall to the other. This trend is 
generally not observed in experiments. However, when turbulent dispersion model 
 
95 
 
 proposed by Simonin et al.  (1990)  (CTD=0.1) was employed, the gas plume was 
concentrated in the central region of the column which is close to the experimental 
observations. When the coefficient of turbulent dispersion was varied from 0.1 to 0.5, the 
difference in the spread or the dispersion of the gaseous phase was very apparent . A lower 
value of C TD ensures a high holdup in the central region leading to steep gas holdup profiles. 
On increasing the C TD value, the spread of the gas holdup profiles become flatter which is 
typically observed in experiments.

 The vector profiles shown in Figure 3.18 indicate the clear difference in the flow patterns 
exhibited while using various turbulent dispersion models. Without using the  turbulence 
dispersion model, there is an u pward flow  in the distributor region with a maximum 
velocity of 0.54 m/s in the central region and 0.12 m/s close to the wall region. The liquid 
recirculation occurs in the bulk region of the column. When  utilizing the turbulent 
dispersion model proposed b y Burns et al. , (2004) , the flow direction is skewed towards 
the wall in the distributor region. In addition , there is a presence of strong recirculation 
pattern in the bulk region. When  employing the turbulent dispersio n model by Simonin et 
al. (1990)  with the turbulent dispersion coefficient of 0.1, an upward flow with a velocity 
of 0.5 m/s in the central region can be observed and a downward velocity of 0.2 m/s exists 
close to the wall region. On the other hand, when increasing the value of the turbulent 
dispe rsion coefficient to 0.5, a minimum velocit y of 0.32 m/s in the downward direction 
can be seen  in the column center. At the column walls, the maximum velocit y of 0.8 m/s is 
observed in the upward direction. In the distributor region, when the turbulent dis persion 
coefficient increases, the large bubbles deflect  towards the wall region, which results in an 
increase in the velocity.

TDF model with CTD=0.1 and (d) Simonin et al. TDF model with CTD=0.5  
In the bulk region, the liquid stream rises in the central region and the profile is skewed 
when the turbulence dispersion model is not used, as shown in Figure 3.19. The maximum 
upward velocity in the central region is 0.68 m/s and the liquid recirculation occurs. The 
minimum velocity in the downward dire ction is 0.38 m/s, which is close to the wall region. 
When  utilizing the turbulent dispersion model proposed by Burns et al.  (2004) , larger 
recirculation is observed in the central region. This has led to a maximum veloc ity of 0.6 
m/s in the upward direction close to the right wall and a maximum velocity of 0.63 m/s in 
the downward direction close to the left wall. When employing the turbulent dispersion 
model by Simonin et al. ,1(990), the flow pattern is identical to that observed in 
experiments. When a coefficient of turbulent dispersion of 0.1 is employed, t he maximum 
upward velocity is 0.47 m/s in the central region and the maximum downward velocity is 
0.26 m/s in the downward direction. If the coefficient of turbulent dispersion is increased 
 
98 
 
 to 0.5, the maximum upward velocity in the central region decrease s to 0.28 m/s and the 
maximum downward velocity in the wall region increases to 0.43 m/s.

TDF model with CTD=0.1 and (d) Simonin et al. TDF model with CTD=0.5  
When the TDF  is neglected, the funneling flow pattern in the disengagement zone  can be 
seen from Figure 3.20, which is quite close to the experimental observations. When the 
TDF is neglected, the liquid upward flow region is narrow and the maximum upward 
velocity is 0.7 m/s in the central region of the column. The maximum downward ve locity 
is 0.38 m/s in the region close to the wall. Smaller liquid circulation occurs in the central 
region of the column. When the TDF model by Burns et al.  (2004)  is employed, the 
funneling flow pattern is not very pro minent and the liquid is more dispersed. In this case, 
a maximum upward velocity of 0.38 m/s and a maximum downwards velocity of 0.36 m/s 
are seen in the central region and the wall region, respectively. When the TDF model 
 
99 
 
 proposed by Simonin et al.  (1990)  with C TD=0.1 is used, the liquid upward flow is 
concentrated in the central region and a maximum upward velocity of 0.42 m/s is noticed. 
Near the wall region, a maximum downward velocity is 0.40 m/s. Strong liquid 
recirculation occurs in the bulk of the column, wh ich is an indication of an improvement 
in the liquid mixing. If the coefficient of turbulent dispersion is increased to 0.5, the 
maximum upward velocity in the central region decreases to 0.34 m/s and the maximum 
downward velocity in the wall region increa ses to 0.5 m/s. Strong liquid recirculation is 
prominent when the coefficient of turbulent dispersion is increased from 0.1 to 0.5.

3.5.1.4  Influence of the drag force model  
The sensitivity of the bubble column hydrodynamic modelling on the drag models used has 
been carefully analyzed and compared in Figure 3.21. The suitability of four types of drag 
 
100 
 
 models proposed in literatures have been tested: Schiller  (1933 ), Tomiyama (1998 ), Ishii 
and Zuber  (1979 ), and Grace  et al.  (1976 ). The drag models have a significant effect on the 
local gas holdup profiles. Out of all the drag models, the Schill er and Naumann drag model 
results in a good agreement for the  local gas holdup with the experimental data of Hills  
(1974)  and Rampure et al.  (2007) . Tomiyama drag model yields much higher gas holdup 
than the experimental results. Guan and Yang  (2017)  reported that the Tomiyama drag 
model overestim ates the gas holdup and the Schiller and Naumann drag model 
underestimates it. The findings made by Guan and Yang (2017) about Tomiyama drag 
model are to the same as the findings of this study. However, the gas holdup from the 
Schiller and Naumann drag mod el agrees well with the experimental data in the bulk of the 
column. But, in the column center, the Schiller and Naumann drag model underpredicts the 
gas holdup by about 11%. Additionally, in the central region (r/R=0), the gas holdups using 
Ishii-Zuber, G race et al. and Tomiyama drag models are overpredicted the gas holdups by 
7%, 25% and 30% respectively. Near the column wall (r/R=1), all the drag models 
excluding Tomiyama model have predicted the holdups well compared with the 
experimental data.  101 
 
  
Figure 3.21 Comparison of   gas holdup profiles using different drag models with the 
experimental data in the transition regime (U G=10 cm/s)  
The overall gas holdups, which is the averaged gas holdup in the col umn, using different 
drag models are  shown in Figure 3.22 . The overall gas holdup obtained using the Schiller 
and Naumann drag model is close to the experimental values reported by Li and Prakash  
(2000)  and Jhawar and Prakash  (2014) . Subse quently, the overall gas holdup obtained 
using the Ishii and Zuber drag model is close to the experimental values reported by Forret 
et al.  (2006)  and Chaumat  et al. ( 2006) . However, the Grace et al. and Tomiyama models 
overestimate the overall gas hold ups.  00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.4

transition regime (U G=10 cm/s)  
The liquid axial velocity profiles, illustrated in Figure 3.23, predicted using all the drag 
models are close to each other. All the drag models are able to predict the centerline liquid 
velocities (at r/R=0) and velocities close to the central region well compared with the 
experimental data . However, away from the central region, the dra g models have 
overpredicted the magnitude of the liquid axial velocity . This could be attributed to the 
effect of the TDF, which affects for the gas dispersion in the column.  00.050.10.150.20.250.30.35Global Gas Holdup, εG

with the experimental data in the transition regime (UG=10 cm/s)  
In order to understand the effect of drag models on the prediction of the gas holdup, the 
gas holdup contours using different drag models are shown in Figure 3.24. The Schiller 
and Naumann drag model gives a maximum gas holdup of 0.25 in the central region of the 
column. There is a significant decrease in the gas holdup from the central region to the 
wall, which is in a ccordance to the experimental observations. With the exception of the 
Tomiyama drag model, the gas holdup distribution is almost uniform between the 
distributor region (z/D c=0) and the disengagement zone (z/D c=9.33).  Compared to other 
drag models, t he drag  model proposed by Tomiyama gives higher gas holdup in the 
distributor region . It is also noticed that the Tomiyama model gives a higher dynamic 
height than other models, which leads to a higher overall gas holdup. The results from the 
drag models by Ishii -Zuber, Grace et al., and Tomiyama show that the bubble plume near -0.6-0.4-0.200.20.40.6

 the distributor region is concentrated in the central region and the plume spreads out to the 
bulk of the column along the axial direction.

It can be seen from the liquid axial velocity contours using different drag models, as shown 
in Figure 3.25, that the max imum velocity is at the central region and minimum velocity is 
at the near wall region from all drag models, which is in accordance with the experimental 
observations. When the Schiller and Naumann drag model is used, the maximum Z-
velocity (axial direction) of 0.44 m/s is in the central region at z/D c=9.33. The maximum 
Y- velocities from the Tomiyama, Ishii -Zuber and Grace et al. models are 0.6 m/s, 0.52 
m/s and 0.50 m/s at axial positions of z/D c=1.33, z/D c=3.66, and z/D c=2.33, respectively . 
The liquid axial velocity by the Schiller and Naumann drag model is in a close agreement 
with the experimental trend. The higher liquid velocity near the distributor region of the 
column is due to the bubbles arising from the sparger.

3.5.2  Reactor hydrodynamics, flow patterns and turbulence  
parameters variation with the flow regime transition  
In this study, the discrete population balance model (PBM) is  used to carry out the two -
phase numerical simulations in a hollow bubble column reactor. The simulations are 
carried out in bubbly flow regim e, transition regimes and churn -turbulent regimes at 
superficial gas velocities of 0.04 m/s, 0.10 m/s and 0.30 m/s, respectively  For the study  on 
the flow regime  transition, the interfacial force models used in this study are listed in Table 
3.6. The Reyn olds Stress Model (RSM) turbulence model with the dispersed formulation 
is used in the current study. The details about the PBM model such as number of bins, bin 
sizes and the choice of kernels is outlined in Table 3.7.

Figure 3.26 shows the radial profiles of the liquid axial velocities under the superficial gas 
velocities of 0.04, 0.1, and 0.30 m/s, which represent the bubbly, transition, and churn 
turbulent regimes, respectively. The liquid axial velocities in the churn turbulent regime 
(UG=0.1 m/s) agree well with experimental results from Hills (1974)  and Sanyal et al , 
(1999) . Figure 3.27 provides a comparison for the centerl ine liquid velocities between the 
simulation results and experimental data. The centerline liquid velocity is a key that affects  
the liquid circulation within bubble columns (Wu et al. , 2001; Forret et al. , 2006; George et 
al., 2017) . At a lower superficial gas velocity of 0.04 m/s, the centerline liquid velocity is 
0.25 m/s and the flow inversion t akes place at r/R=0.67. The centerline liquid velocity 
attained under U G = 0.04 m/s is close to the experimental value obtained by Degaleesan et 108 
 
 al. (2001)  using a perforated plate wi th 121 holes. Other experimental values of centerline 
liquid velocities are in less proximity to the simulation results at the low velocity. The reason 
could be attributed to the sparger design and the measurement techniques employed. At 
lower superficial gas velocities, the number of perforations in the sparger is an important 
parameter that determines the bubble size distribution within the reactor. If coarse spargers 
are used, bubbles with large diameters could travel through the central region of the co lumn 
thereby increasing the centerline liquid velocity.  
In the transition regime (U G=0.1 m/s), the flow inversion takes place at r/R=0.67 and the 
centerline liquid velocity is 0.44 m/s, which agrees with experimental data by Degaleesan 
(1998)  and Jhawar and Prakash (2014)  where the column diameters of 0.14 m and 0.15 m 
are close to the numerical setup used in this study. However, the experimental data from 
Menzel et al.  (1990)  could be considered as experimental outliers as their liquid velocity was 
extremely high. The  column employed had a diameter of 0.6 m, which could be one of the 
reasons for higher discrepancy.  
In the churn turbulent regime (U G=0.3 m/s), the centerline liquid velocity is 0.69 m/s, which 
agrees with that from Jhawar and Prakash (2014) , where the experimental value is 0.696 
m/s. The flow inversion takes place at r/R=0.6. Since not many studies have been carried out 
in the churn turbulent regime, this was the only comp arison that could be made.   109

 Figure 3.28 illustrates a comparison of the radial profiles of gas holdups under superficial 
gas velocities of 0.04, 0.10 and 0.30 m/s, respectively. At a superficial gas velocity of 0.04 
m/s, a maximum gas holdup is 0.146 in the central region of the column and the gas holdup 
decreases along the radial direction from the center to the wall, which is in a close 
agreement with the experimental data from Hills (1974)  and Rampure et al.  (2007) . Near 
the wall region, the gas holdup decreases more rapidly as compared to the experimental 
data from Hills (1974)  and dual -tip probe study by Rampure et al.  (2007) . The reason could 
be attributed to the presence of asymmetric liquid around the gas bubbles due to which the

 bubble is forced to move into the central region of th e column leading to lower gas holdups 
in the vicinity of column walls (Tao et al. , 2019) . This force is termed as the wall 
lubrication force, which is not considered in the curre nt study due to longer simulation time  
and inadequate data in the literature.  The  predicted profile of gas holdup does not agree 
well with the experimental data from Chaumat et al.  (2006)  and Rampure et al.  (2007)  
using a sin gle tip probe. The study conducted by Chaumat et al.  (2006)  employed a double 
optic probe to measure the gas holdup along the radial locations and on the other hand, 
Rampure et al.  (2007)  used a single -tip conductivity probe i nclined at an angle of 40o. The 
difference these experimental from the other experimental data could be due to various 
reasons like probe orientation, type of probe used, number of probes in consideration, 
height of measurement and averaging techniques.  
At a superficial gas velocity of 0.10 m/s, a maximum holdup of 0.243 is noted in the central 
region of the column and the gas holdup decreases along the radial direction from the center 
to the wall.  The gas holdup in the bulk region of the column agrees wel l with the 
experimental data from Hills (1974)  and Rampure et al.  (2007)  at superficial gas velocities 
of 0.096 m/s and 0.10 m/s, respectively. However, near the wall reg ion, the radial gas 
holdup is underpredicted due to the lack of wall lubrication effect as seen in the earlier 
case. In the churn -turbulent regime (U G=0.30 m/s), the radial gas holdup in the central 
region is 0.34. The gas holdups at high velocities are no t compared to any experimental 
data due to lack the experimental data in the existing literature.   112

Figure 3.2 9 demonstrates a comparison of the overall  gas holdup s between the numerical 
results  and experimental data. As expected, the overall gas holdup increase s with the 
increas e in the  superficial gas velocity. At a lower superficial gas velocity of 0.04 m/s, the 
overall gas holdup is close to that attained by Jhawar and Prakash (2014)   and it is lower 
than those from Rampure et al.  (2007) , Forret et al.  (2006) , Chaumat et al. (2006)  and Yao 
et al.  (1991) . At lower superficial gas velocities, the gas distributor design has strong effect 
on the overall gas holdup. If distributors with fine perforations of about 1 mm are 
employed, bubbles with smaller diameter are generated which leads to higher gas holdup  
(Luo et al. , 1999; Krishna and Sie, 2000; Forret et al. , 2006) . Rampure et al. (2007),

1991) , respectively , which contributes to high values of the overall  gas holdups. In the 
transition regime (U G=0.10 m/s), the overall  gas holdups agree well with those reported by 
Jhawar and Prakash (2014) , Menzel et al.  (1990) , Hills (1974)  and Forret et al.  (2006)  . 
However, the overall gas holdups are different from those obtained  by Chaumat et al.  
(2006) , Rampure et al.  (2007)  and Yu a nd Kim (1991) . The lower overall  gas holdup from  
Yu and Kim (1991)  could be linked to the continuous mode of operation in  which the gas 
and liquid phases flow s in a concurrent fashion into the column , thereby reducing the gas 
holdup (Wachi et al. , 1987; Kantarci  et al. , 2005) . At superficial gas velocit y of 0.3 m/s, a 
good agreement  is noticed between the numerical results  and all the experimental data. At 
higher velocities, the gas holdups become independent of column diameter and sparger 
configuration  (Vatai and Tekić, 1989; Wilkinson et al. , 1992; Forret et al. , 2003; Kanaris 
et al. , 2018) .  114 
 
  
Figure 3.29 Comparison of the overall gas holdups under various superficial gas velocities

The structure of turbulence can be measured by the strength of turbulent eddies (Besagni 
et al. , 2018)  . When eddies are generated as a result of i nitial flow, they are of large scale 
and comprise of high kinetic energy, which are eventually decomposed to smaller scale 
eddies (Okada et al., 1993) . Turbulent viscosity ratio is directly proportional to the 
Reynolds number in the turbulent regime and is defined as the ratio between turbulent 
viscosity and the dynamic viscosity (ANSYS, 2013) . Figures 3.30 and 3.31 illustrate the 
effect of the superficial gas velocity on radial profile of the turbulent viscosity ratio and 
contour  of the turbulent viscosity ratio, respectively. Clearly, the turbulent viscosity ratio 
increases with increase in the superficial gas velocity and it is high in the central region 
and decreases from the central region towards the wall region. The m aximum turbulent 
115 
 
 viscosity ratios under the superficial gas velocities of 0.04, 0.10 and 0.30 m/s are 1933, 
3605 and 6600, respectively. The minimum turbulent viscosity ratios under the superficial 
gas velocities of 0.04, 0.10 and 0.30 m/s are 20, 32 and 5 0, respectively.

The plots of bubble size fraction based on discrete number densities of bubbles in the 
bubbly, transition and churn turbulent regimes are illustrated in Figure 3.32. In the bubbly 
flow regime, the number density of small bubbles with chord lengths between 1 mm and 2 
mm increase rapidly. The number density of 2 mm bubbles is predominantly high in the 
bubbly flow regime when compared to the other two regimes. This agrees with the trends 
noticed in experimental observations. At the superficial gas velocity of 0.04 m/s, the 
number density of bubbles greater than 2 mm decreases and minimal number of bubbles 
with chord lengths higher than 10 mm have been noticed. Consecutively, in the other 
 
117 
 
 regimes, the highest peak is noticed at 2 mm bubble size followed by a dec rease in the 
number density of larger bubbles. It is noted that, the number densities of large bubbles 
with chord lengths greater than 10 mm, increase with the increase in the superficial gas 
velocity.

The vector plots of the liquid axial velocity at the distribution, bulk and disengagement 
zones for the different flow regimes are presented in Figure s 3.3 3, 3.3 4 and 3.3 5, 
respectively. In the distributor region, recirculation profiles of lower intensity are noticed 
in the bubbly and transition regimes. However, when increasing the superficial gas 
velocity, the intensity of recirculation strengthens, w hich is due to the higher turbulent 
viscosity ratio as seen earlier. In the bulk region, an upward flow in the central region and 
downward flow close to the walls can be seen, which conforms to the experimental 
observation. In the distributor region, the f unneling effect is clearly noticed in the bubbly 00.050.10.150.20.25

 and transition regimes. Nevertheless, such an effect is not seen in the churn -turbulent 
regime. Based on these vector plots, a generalized flow map for a hollow bubble column 
has been developed  (Figure 3.3 6) and a comparison is made with study carried out by 
Devanathan  et al. (1 990). In their study, a maximum axial liquid velocity of 0.52 m/s was 
reported in the central region f or a superficial gas velocity of 0.105 m/s. In this study, it is 
found that a maximum velocity is 0.48 m/s for a superficial gas velocity of 0.10 m/s, which 
is in line with the experimental observations.

 3.5.3  Comparison of Bubble Breakup and Bubble Coalescence 
Models  
Over the years, many studies have used the Population Balance Model (PBM) in the 
numerical simulations  of bubble column reactors (Chen, Duduković and Sanyal, 2005; 
Bhole, Joshi and Ramkrishna, 2008; Yang, Guo and Wang, 2017; Sarhan, Naser and 
Brooks, 2018; Yang et al. , 2018; Agahzamin and Pakzad, 2019a; Shi et al. , 2019; Shi, J. 
Yang, et al. , 2020) . The inclusion of the PBM can pr ovide a better prediction on  the bubble 
size distributions within the reactor. One of the key issues in using the PBM is the 
reasonable selection of the bubble breakup and coalescence models (Wang and Wang, 
2007) . In the present work , an effort has been made to understand the effect  the bubble 
breakup and coalescence models  on the numerica l simulation results . The b ubble 
coalescence model proposed by Luo (1995)  is used in the current work. This model was 
successfully used in the past to model the bubble coalescence within the reactor (Xu et al. , 
2014; Syed et al. , 2017; Zhang and Luo, 2020) . Two popula r breakup models proposed by  
Luo and Svendsen (1996)  and Lehr  et al.  (2002)  are compared in this study . Both the 
breakup models predict the daughter bubble distribution and breakup rates, the difference, 
however, lies in the prediction of binary bubble breakup rate. Therefore, simulations are  
performed using the Luo (1995) coalescence  model with Luo (1996) breakup  model, which 
is named as Luo -Luo model, and the Luo (1995) coalescence  model with the Lehr (2002)  
breakup  model, which is named as Luo -Lehr model. .  
In his recent work, Gaurav  (2018)  used indiscrete (multiple bubble phases) PBM model  
phase in the simulations to better predict the bubble distribution in a reactor . When the 122 
 
 multiple bubble phase PBM  model is employed, the gas phase is divided into several 
groups based on the bubble sizes. This approach allows us to treat different dispersed phase  
groups  separately , by dividing them into multiple  groups based on the bubble size .  
Population balance equ ations are solved for each of these groups  separately. Krepper  et al.  
(2007)  employed a polydisperse model based on experimental observations. Bubbles 
diameters between 1 and 7 mm were assigned as small bubbles and those between 7 to 35 
mm were ascribed as large bubbles. Although both the models predicted the trend 
effectively, it  was reported that the results from the multiple bubble phase  model  were  
closer to the experimental observations. In the present study, for the comparison purpose, 
simulations are carried out using both the single and two bubble phase models, where the 
gas phase is divided into two bubble groups, coupled with Luo -Luo and Luo -Lehr 
coalescence  and breakup models.  
The interfacial forces and boundary conditions employed in the current study  are provided 
in Tables 3.8 and 3.9, respectively. The Schiller -Naumann  and Tomiyama drag models 
have  been effectively used in the past to model small and large bubble s, respectively 
(Gaurav, 2018) . Therefore, in this study, the Tomiyama drag model is used with the single 
bubble phase  model and the Schiller -Naumann and Tomiyama drag models are employed  
for small and large bubble  groups respectively,  when the two bubble phase  model is used . 
For the single bubble phase  model, a constant lift force model with a negative lift 
coefficient is employed.  For the two bubble phase  model , the lift force for small bubbles is 
neglected and the constant lift force model with a negative lift coefficient is used for large 
bubbles. The t urbulence dispersion model proposed by Simonin  et al.  (1990)  is used in the 
simulation.  In the single bubble phase  model, the coefficient of the turbulence dispersion 123 
 
 is assigned as 0.2. For the  two bubble phase  model , the coefficient s of the turbulence 
dispersion for small and large bubbles are 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. The Sauter mean 
bubble diameter is assigned for each of the phases.  
The parameters used in  the single and two  bubble phase  PBM models are outlined in Tables 
3.10 and 3.11, respectively. The PBM formulation proposed by Kumar and Ramkrishna 
(1996)  is used to analyze the bubble size distributions in the column. In the single bubble  
phase  model , the bubble sizes are distributed across 12 bins and in the two bubble phase  
model, small bubbles and large bubbles are distributed across 6 bins each. The minim um 
bubble diameter under consideration is 1 mm and maximum bubble size is 40.5 mm. The 
boundary conditions used in the current work are outlined in Table 3.11.

A comparison of the gas holdup profiles along the radial direction using the both the single 
and two bubble phase models with Luo -Luo and Luo -Lehr breakup and coalescence 
models is provided in Figure 3.37.  The result using  the single bubble size model wher e the 
PBM is not employed and the bubble diameter is assumed as 6 mm is also shown in Figure 
3.37 for comparison purpose. The numerical results are  validated against the experimental  
data from  Zhang  et al.  (2009)  and Sanyal et al.  (1999) , as shown in Figure 3.37. The 
difference between the experimental data from Zhang  et al.  (2009)   and Sanyal et al.  (1999)  
could be attributed to different measurement techniques and averaging strategi es they 
employed since Zhang  et al.  (2009)   and Sanyal et al.  (1999)  used the conductivity p robe 
and computed tomography (CT) techniques in the measurements of the radial gas holdups. 
When the PBM is used, the gas holdup profiles along the radial direction have the same 
trend as the experimental data. When the Luo -Luo model is used in the single and two 
bubble phase models, the agreement with the experimental data from Zhang  et al.  (2009)  
is good. However,  the gas holdups using Luo -Lehr model for both the single and two 
bubble phase models are higher. This is attributed to the higher breakup rates noticed in 
the Luo -Lehr model, leading to an increase in the gas holdup. The gas holdup obtained by 
using the t wo bubble phase model with the Luo -Lehr model is close to the experimental 
data from Sanyal et al.  (1999) . However, when the single bubble size model is employed, 127 
 
 a flat gas holdup profile along the radial direction between r/R=0 and r/R=0.66is noticed. 
Near the wall region, there is a sudden decrease in th e gas holdup.

A comparison of the axial variation of mean Sauter diameter, d b32, using different break -
up and coalescence models is presente d in Figure 3.38. The data are at r=0 between the 
axial positions of z=0 and z=1 m. Using  the single bubble phase model with the Luo -Luo 
and Luo -Lehr models, the mean bubble size near the inlet is 9.1 mm and 8.1 mm, 
respectively. The mean diameter increase s slightly along the axial direction and a constant 
diameter of 15 mm (Luo -Luo model) and 12 mm (Luo -Lehr model) are observed in the 
fully developed region (z>0.5 m). The variations of small bubble mean diameter and large 
bubble mean diameter from the two bubble phase model are also illustrated in Figure 3.38. 
The mean bubble diameters obtained by the Luo -Luo and Luo -Lehr models with the two 
bubble phase model near the inlet are 5.0 mm and 5.2 mm, respectively. The result from 
the two bubble phase Luo -Luo m odel shows that there is a very small increase in the size 00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.4

 of small bubbles along the axial direction from the distributor and the mean bubble 
diameter maintains at 7 mm in the fully developed region. On the other hand, the  result 
from the two bubble phase  Luo-Luo model shows that a decrease in the small bubble mean 
diameter is noticed above the distributor, and a constant diameter of small bubbles is 1.8 
mm in the fully developed region. The large bubble mean diameters near the inlet are 12.37 
mm and 13.28  mm from Luo -Luo and Luo -Lehr models, respectively. The size of large 
bubbles from the two bubble phase Luo -Luo model increases steadily along  the axial 
direction and a constant mean large bubble diameter of 19.70 mm is noted in the fully 
developed region. In contrast, based on the two bubble phase Luo -Lehr model, the size of 
large bubble increases rapidly along the axial direction above the dis tributor region and the 
mean large bubble diameter steadily increases over the entire column. At z=1 m, the Sauter 
diameter noted is 36.09 mm.

 A comparison  of the distribution of the small and large bubble fractions obtained from 
different break -up and coalescence models is presented in Figure 3. 39. The fraction of 
small bu bbles predicted by the Luo -Lehr model for both in the single and two bubble phase 
modes is higher than that predicted by the  Luo-Luo model. This is due to the superior 
breakup rates imposed by the Lehr breakup model. The presence  of large fraction of small  
bubbles increases the gas holdups, as seen earlier. On the other hand, the results from the 
Luo-Luo model with both the single and two bubble phase mode exhibit realistic fractional 
distributions since the Luo -Luo model is able to effectively account for the presence of 
large bubbles formed due to coalescence. It is evident that the amount of small bubbles 
(db<5 mm) predicted by the two bubble phase model are higher than that predicted by the 
single bubble phase model. Therefore, the amount of large bubble s (d b>5 mm) predicted 
by the single bubble phase model are higher than that from the two bubble phase model.

 3.5.4  Dual Bubble Size Model  
The Population Balance Models (PBM) have been used for the past 5 decades, but their 
application was prevalent after superior computational facilities were developed (Vanni, 
2000; Rigopoulos and Jones, 2003; Rigopoulos, 2010) . The inclusion of the PBM adds to 
the overall complexity and should be used in the modelling to solve a pertinent objective 
(Nopens et al., 2015) . Although several attempts have been made to apply P opulati on 
Balance Equation s (PBEs) to multiphase flows, its validation remains an open question due 
to the cumbersome data collection in the literature. A number of authors have endorsed the 
inclusion of bubble breakup and coalescence models in bubble column reac tor studies. 
However, only certain processes , such as the  mass transfer in bubble column s, strictly 
require the inclusion of the PBM. The main focus of the current work is to investigate  the 
effectiveness of the two bubble population model approach proposed by  Krishna and 
Ellenberger (1996 ). This work aims at applying the two bubble population model without 
the PBM and analyzing the resulting hydrodynamic parameters.  
In the heterogenous regime, the bubbles are divided into two groups, small and large 
bubbles, as shown in Figure 3.40. Small bubbles (1 mm<d b<6 mm)  are spherical and large 
bubble (d b>20 mm) are ellipsoidal and spherical cap (Grace and Harrison, 1967; Wegener 
and Parlange, 1973; Bhaga and Weber, 1981) . In the current work, the velocities of small 
and large bubbles are modelled using the experimental work car ried out by Schumpe and 
Grund (1986 ). In their study, the contribution of small and large bubble velocities to the 
gas flow was studied and a correlation between the superficial gas velocity  and bubble  131 
 
 velocities (small and large)  was obtained as shown in Figure 3.4 1 using the experimental 
data of small and large bubble velocities.

The total superficial gas velocity can be described as:  
𝑈𝐺=𝑈𝐺,𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑙 +𝑈𝐺,𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒    (3.20) 
where 𝑈𝐺,𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑙  and 𝑈𝐺,𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒  are the velocit ies associated with small bubbles and large 
bubbles , respectively . These can be described by the equations obtained based on the 
experimental data ( Schumpe and Grund, 1986 ):

The interfacial forces and boundary conditions used for the current analysis are provided 
in Tables  3.12 and 3.13, respectively. The Schiller -Naumann and Tomiyama drag models 
are used to model small and large bubble sizes, respectively . Lift force for small bubbles 
is neglected and a constant lift force model is used for large bubbles. The turbulence 
dispersion model proposed by Simonin is used in the simulation. The coefficients of the 
turbulence dispersion for small and large bubbles are 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. Constant 
bubble diameters are assigned for each bubble phase. In Case A, the diameters of small 
bubbles and large bubbles are 4 mm and 20 mm, respectively. In  Cases B and C, the 
diameters of small bubb les and large bubbles are 5 mm and 15 mm, respectively. This 
study is carried out at a superficial gas velocity of U G =12 cm/s.

The comparison of the liquid axial velocity profiles along the radial direction using the 
dual bubble size modelling approach with difference bubble sizes is outlined in Figure 
3.42. The highest and lowest centerline liquid velocities are in Cases B and A,  respectively. 
The locations of the flow inversion are at r/R=0.60 for Cases A and C and at r/R=0.533  for 
Case B. The liquid axial velocities are also compared with the experimental data by Zhang  
et al.  (2009)  and Sanyal et al.  (1999) . The difference between the experimental results f rom 
Zhang  et al.  (2009)  and Sanyal et al.  (1999)  could be due to the measurement techniques 
and averaging strategies employed in their respective studies. Zhang  et al.  (2009)  used 
Pavlov tube technique and Sanyal et al.  (1999) , on the other hand,  employed the CARPT 135 
 
 technique to measure the liquid axial velocities, respectively. In Case A, the liquid axial 
velocity is underpredicted in the central region and is close to the experimental  data near 
the wall region. The liquid axial velocities in the central region in Cases B and C agree 
well  with the experimental data of Zhang  et al.  (2009)  and Sanyal et al.  (1999) , 
respectively. However, the liquid axial velocities in the region close to the wall are 
overpredicted in Cases B and C.

3.6 Concluding Remarks  
In the current work, hollow bubble columns have been extensively analyzed using the 
numerical approach. The effect of interfacial forces has been thoroughly studied and an 
138 
 
 appropriate selection of the interfacial model has been utilized to study the effect  of flow 
regime transitions. The c onstant lift force model was found to give better  predict ions for 
the local gas holdups and liquid axial velocity profiles as compared to the Tomiyama and 
Saffman -Mei models. The addition of bubble induced turbulence led t o homogeneity in the 
gas holdup profiles. When the turbulent dispersion model was added, the gas plume was 
dispersed throughout the cross section of the bubble column. The Simonin model 
outperformed the Burns et al. model in predicting the local gas holdup  and liquid axial 
velocity profiles. In the drag model study, Schiller -Naumann model outperformed the other 
drag models in the prediction of local and overall gas holdup values.  
In the flow transition studies, an increase in the liquid axial velocit y was observed with an 
increase in  the superficial gas velocity. The comparison of the centerline liquid velocity 
with experimental data from numerous studies was made and a good agreement  was 
obtained . Radial gas holdups increased with an increase in the super ficial gas velocity and 
they are  closely correspond to experimental observations made by Hills (1974) , Chaumat  
et al.  (2006)  and Rampure et al.  (2007) . Overall gas holdups obtained through numerical 
study have been compared wit h various experimental data and a good agreement  has been 
obtained. The i ncrease in turbulent parameters was noticed when  increasing the superficial 
gas velocity. A comparison of normalized bubble number densities was made, and an 
increased number of large  bubble fractions was noticed when  increasing  the superficial gas 
velocity. Liquid circulations have been studied across the distributor, bulk and the 
disengagement zone and a generalized flow circulation mapping has been generated for 
hollow bubble column s. A good agreement  was observed compared with the experimental 
data. 139 
 
 When various bubble breakup and coalescence models were tested, a combination of Luo 
breakup model and Luo coalescence model exhibited realistic bubble  fraction  distributions. 
This model  was able to effectively account for the presence of large bubbles in the 
dispersion. The Lehr breakup model increased the rate of breakup thereby increasing the 
fraction of smaller bubbles in the dispersion. Dual bubble size models was able to 
effectively  predict the local gas holdups, liquid axial velocities and overall gas holdups. 
The absence of PBM in these models did not hinder the effective estimation of any of the 
hydrodynamic parameters.

4 CFD Simulations of Bubble Column Reactors Occluded 
with Circular Tube Bundle and Dense Vertical Internals  
Bubble column reactors have found their applications i n various process es in chemical and 
biochemical  industries owing to their multitude advantages like high heat and mass transfer 
rates, lack of moving parts, simple construction and low maintenance costs (Duduković, 
Larachi and Mills, 2002; Li et al. , 2003; Ni et al. , 2006; Shaikh and Al -Dahhan, 2013; 
Joseph, 2016; George, Jhawar and Prakash, 2017; Valero et al. , 2019) . The main fac tor that 
differentiates these reactors from the typical continuous stirred tank reactors and fixed bed 
reactors is their ability to establish superior levels of heat and mass transfer rates at low 
energy inputs. As of late, these reactors are preferred to carry out Fischer -Tropsch, 
methanol synthesis and CO 2 methanation which are highly exothermic reactions 
(Ledakowicz et al. , 1992; van der Laan  et al. , 1999; Rados, Al -Dahhan and Dudukovic, 
2003; Rahimpour  et al. , 2012; Zhang et al. , 2014; Lefebvre et al. , 2015; Ali et al. , 2020) .  
Vertical heat exchanging rods are a popular  choice of internals within the reactor that 
facilitate the heat removal and heat circulation using high pressure steam (Desvigne et al., 
2006; Abdulmohsin and Al -Dahhan, 2012; Besagni and Inzoli, 2016; Möller et al. , 2019) . 
Therefore, the costs associated with the installation of circulation pumps and addition of 
new heat exchanger assemblies can be reduced. The rate of heat exchang e depends on the 
cross -sectional area (CSA) occluded by the internals. Until now, bubble columns with a 
CSA occlusion between 20% and 60% have been commonly studied. When the available 
CSA is covered with internals, the hydrodynamics parameters vary, and t heir analysis is a 151 
 
 difficult process owing to the complexity of equipment needed and their associated 
expenses.  
Many studies suggested  that the phase holdups could be drastically altered in the presence 
of internals. An increase in the gas velocity caused  by the decrease in the cross sectional 
area in the presence of internals was found to be the main reason for the increase of gas 
holdups. The decrease in the bubble size leads to increases in the interfacial area and gas 
holdup (Saxena  et al. , 1992; Hulet et al. , 2009; Youssef et al. , 2012) . Even though vertical 
tube internals are advantageous, superior degree of backmixing has been noticed as 
compared to hollow bubble columns (Shaykhutdi nov, Bakirov and Usmanov, 1971; 
Knickle et al. , 1983) . Forret et al.  (2003)  noticed an increase in the magnitude of large 
scale liquid recirculation a nd a decrease in the fluctuating liquid velocities when bubble 
columns are occluded with internals as shown in Figure 4.1.   
 
Figure 4.1 Recirculation patterns in the presence of vertical tube internals (Red rawn 
from Forret et al.  (2003) )

 Full-fledged scale up of bubble column reactors are expensive and the scale up has proven 
to be really challenging due to the underlying fluid dynamic aspects. When a bubble 
column reactor must be occluded with internals, the choice of various innards and the 
associated operation variables make it even more challenging for an effective scale up.  A 
considerable progress has been made in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
over the last few decades . CFD is a powerful and effective tool that is us ed to simulate a 
wide range of industrial processes. Multiphase flow CFD simulations are bound to provide 
numerous challenges as compared to singular phase flows. In the current study, CFD 
simulations have been performed to study the hydrodynamics and turb ulence parameters 
for a bubble column reactor with internals in the form of circular vertical -tube bundles.  
4.1 Objectives  
The numerical simulations of bubble column reactors with a single circular tube bundle 
comprising of 15 rods and denser vertical interna ls comprising of 38 rods are carried out 
using ANSYS Fluent v19.2, which is one of the widely used commercial CFD packages. 
2-D planar simulations are carried out to study the hydrodynamic and turbulence 
parameters .  
The simulations are carried out in bubb ly flow regime, transition regime and churn -
turbulent regime at superficial gas velocities of 0.04 m/s, 0.10 m/s and 0.30 m/s, 
respectively. The effect of the superficial gas velocity on hydrodynamic parameters such 
as radial profiles of gas holdups, liqui d axial velocities, overall gas holdups, centerline 
liquid axial velocities and bubble size distributions have been investigated and compared 
with numerous experimental data. The effect of flow regimes on turbulence parameters, 
such as turbulence viscosity  ratio and turbulence Reynolds number, has been investigated.  153 
 
 4.2 Configuration of the Bubble Column  
The numerical modelling of a single circular tube bundle is based on the pilot -scale bubble 
column of Jhawar and Prakash (2014 ) shown in Figure 4.2. In their experimental study, 
Jhawar and Prakash  (2014 ) used a circular tube bundle consisting of 15 tubes with the 
length and diameter of 1.5 m and 9.5 mm, respectively.  On the other hand, the dense 
vertical tube model shown in Figure 4.3 has been designed for the sole purpose of the 
numerical study. The focus of the current study is to investigate the hydrodynamics of 
bubble column reactor when it is obstructed with vertical internals. Jhawar and Prakash 
(2014 ) carried out their experiments in a Plexiglas column of 2.5 m in height and 0.15 m  in 
diameter.  The column was equipped with a coarse sparger, through which the secondary 
phase was introduced. In their study, tap water and compressed air were used as primary 
and secondary sources, respectively. The study was carried out at various super ficial gas 
velocities ranging from 3 cm/s to 35 cm/s. The static height of the liquid was maintained

 4.2.1  Computational Domain and Grid Independ ence Test  
Two-dimensional simulations of the bubble column are carried out in this study.  The 
structured mesh  for the two -dimensional computational domain is generate d using ICEM 
CFD 17.0. In the two -dimensional computational domain for the column with a single 
circular bundle of 15 tubes, the internals on the central plane of the three -dimensional 
column are replaced by 2 vertical perforated rods and the size of each perforation is equal 
to the pitch of tubes (4.4 mm). For the column with two circular bundles of 38 tubes, the 
internals are represented by 4 vertical perforated rods. The size of the perforation for the 
inner circular tube bundle is equal to 4.4 mm and th at for the outer tube bundle is 5.9 mm. 
In addition, the fraction of spaces in the internal rod is made equal to the available total 
free surface area of the 3D circular tube bundle. The space fraction for the 15 tube internals 
is 31% and for the outer tub e consisting of 23 tubes is 38%. The total height of the internals 
is kept equal to 1.5 m  (Jhawar and Prakash, 2014) . The internals are placed at a height of 
0.5 m from the distributor. Details of the internal geometry and the calculations are 
provided in Appendix C.   
The grid independence tests are carried out using three meshes and the effect  of mesh 
density on radial  gas holdups is investigated for the columns with 15 tubes and 38 tubes. 
The medium mesh is chosen after taking the accuracy of the solution and the convergence 
time into the consideration. The difference  between the results from the medium and fine 
mesh i s within the acceptable tolerance levels of 4%. The comparison of the radial profiles 
of gas holdups from the medium and fine meshes is illustrated in Figures 4.6 and 4.7 for 
columns with 15 tubes and 38 tubes, respectively.  Smaller grid sizes are used cl ose to the 
column and internal walls to capture the effective physics. The first grid point from the 156 
 
 wall is maintained in a way such that the Y+ value lied in the viscous sub layer since the 
enhanced wall functions are used. Four nodes between the tubes a re ascribed to capture the 
liquid recirculation patterns effectively.

4.2.2  Numerical Method  
The numerical simulations of the bubble column reactor are  carried out using ANSYS 
Fluent v19.2. The simulations are carried out for a water -air system and an incompressible 
method (Pressure -based solver) is utilized. The Reynolds Stress Model ( RSM) with  
dispersed formulation is used in the current study as it ca n accurately capture the 
anisotropic nature of the turbulent kinetic energy, a key parameter in the bubble column 
modelling. For the flow transition study, simulations of the bubble column with a single 
circular tube bundle of 15 tubes and two circular tub e bundles of38 tubes are been carried 
out using low (U G=0.04 m/s), medium (U G=0.10 m/s) and high (U G=0.30 m/s) gas flow 
rates.

 Water and air are selected as the primary phase and secondary phase, respectively. The 
discrete phase PBM is employed in the cur rent analysis. The spatial variables are 
discretized by Green -Gauss Cell based method. The phase -coupled SIMPLE method  is 
used for the pressure -velocity coupling. In the current study, the QUICK scheme is used 
for the momentum and volume fraction  equation s and the second order upwind scheme is 
used for  the governing equations for the turbulence parameters and gas bin fractions as 
suggested by Gaurav (2018) and Gupta and Roy (2013). The convergence criterion is set 
to as 10-3 for the absolute residuals of all transport equations. The initial time step is set as 
0.0001 s for the first 3 seconds of flow time and is then increased in succession to 0.0005 
s and 0.001 s after 8 seconds and 15 seconds , respectively to avert numerical divergence. 
The flow simulati on is carried out for 200 seconds and time averaging of flow properties , 
such as  radial gas holdups , axial  liquid  velocities , turbulence parameters and Sauter 
diameter,  are commenced after a quasi -steady state is achieved in the simulation, which is 
about3 0 seconds of the flow time. Hence, the simulation results are averaged for about 170 
s.  The numerical models used in the current work are summarized in Table 4.1.

4.2.2.1  Boundary Conditions  
At the inlet, the superficial gas velocity, the  volume fraction of the gas phase, and the initial 
bin frac tions are specified. Very few researchers have explicitly mentioned their choice of 
turbulent quantities for the liquid phase at the inlet, which makes it a great challenge to 
specify the turbulence parameters at the inlet for gas -liquid flows. In a recent  study by 
Magolan et al.  (2019) , turbulence intensity of 0.1 and turbulent viscosity ratio  of 100 were 
used. In another study carried out by Nygren (2014) , the turbulent intensity was set at 10% 
at the inlet. In the current study, the turbulent intensity of 5% and hydraulic diameter of 
0.15 m (equivalent to the diameter of the bubble column reactor) are applied. The outflow 
boundary condition is applied at the outlet. No slip boundary condition is applied at the 
column walls and the internal walls.  161 
 
 4.3 Results and Discussion  
The current section is divided into two segments. In the first segment, the influence of 
interfacial forces (lift and turbulent dispersion forces) is studied on bubble column with 15 
internals. The second segment highlights the effect of flow regime transi tion on 
hydrodynamic parameters for bubble column with 15 and 38 tube vertical internals.  All 
the results presented in this section are time averaged .  
4.3.1  Influence of interfacial forces on hydrodynamics of  a bubble 
column with internals  
The choice of approp riate interfacial forces is crucial in the prediction of flow patterns and 
reactor hydrodynamics. So far, very little work has been done to help understand the 
sensitivity of interfacial forces flow patterns and reactor hydrodynamics when bubble 
columns ar e equipped with internals.  The current section discusses the influence of lift 
models and turbulent dispersion models on the flow  pattern in the bubble column with a 
single circular tube bundle of 15 tubes.  
4.3.1.1  Influence o f the lift force model  
The effect of  lift force coefficient is investigated in the transition regime (10 cm/s) and the 
radial variation of liquid axial velocities are illustrated in Figure 4.8. The centerline liquid 
axial velocity from the positive lift force coefficient of C L=+0.1 is underp redicted  as 
compared to the zero lift force (C L=0) and negative lift coefficients . When a positive lift 
coefficient is used, the bubbles migrate from regions of higher velocities to the lower 
velocity regions. However, when a positive lift coefficient is e mployed, a higher  simulation  
stability  (fewer divergence issues)  is noticed, which is in accordance to the observations 162 
 
 made by Lucas  et al.,  (2005) . The liquid velocities predicted by using a zero lift force 
(CL=0) and small magnitude of a negativ e lift coefficient (C L= -0.05) are closer to the 
experimental data  (shown in Figure 4.18)  obtained by Jhawar and Prakash (2014) . When 
simulations are performed with a higher magnitude of a negative lift coefficient (C L=-0.1), 
the liquid axial velocity is overpredicted by 36%. Tomiyama lift mod el results in an 
asymmetrical axial liquid velocity profile as shown in Figure 4.8. The trends of the liquid 
velocity variation can be well comprehended from the contours illustrated in Figure 4.9. It 
is noticed that the higher axial liquid velocity occurs  between the two internals from the 
bottom of the internals to the dispersion height  (z=1.4 m)  using C L=0, CL=-0.1 and 
Tomiyama lift models. However, the magnitude of the negative liquid velocity between 
the internal and column wall is overestimated by the  negative lift force coefficient. 
Tomiyama model dispersed the plume from one internal wall to the other leading to uneven 
liquid velocity profiles.  163

 The influence  of lift force model on the gas holdup profiles is depicted in Figure 4.10 and 
Figure 4.11 . In the case of a zero lift force, the radial profiles of the gas holdups between 
the internals, and between the internal and the column wall are close to the experimental 
trends in the literature . The same trend is noticed f or C L= -0.05. However, when the 
magnitude of negative lift force increases (C L= -0.1), the bubbles tend to move to the 
central region, which is of high liquid velocity. This leads to a steep increase in the gas 
holdup at r/R=0 followed by a decrease in the  gas holdup between the internal and column 
wall. Using a positive lift coefficient leads to a slight underprediction of the gas holdup at 
r/R=0 and overestimation of gas holdup between the internal and column wall  as compared 
to the zero and negative lift  coefficients . Out of all the lift coefficients, Tomiyama model 
overpredicted the gas holdups in the central region as well as the region between the 
internal and column wall.

4.3.1.2  Influence of  the turbulence dispersion force  
The effect of turbulent dispersion model on the flow patterns in the reactor column is 
investigated in the transition regime (10 cm/s) and the radial profiles and contours of the 
liquid axial velocities using different turbulent dispersion models are shown  in Figure 4.1 2 
and Figure 4.1 3, respectively. When the turbulent dispersion force is neglected (C TD=0), 
the liquid velocity distribution in the radial direction is asymmetric as shown in Figure 
4.12. This can be attributed to the improper spreading of the plume within the column when 
the turbulent dispersion force is neglected. Positive axial velocity i s noticed between r/R=0 
and r/R = -0.361 (between column wall and internal) which is contradictory to the 
experimental observations. When turbulent dispersion model proposed by Simonin  et al.  
(1990)  is used,  the predicted radial profile for the liquid axial velocity is symmetric. Wit h 
CTD=0.3, a good match of centerline liquid velocity with experimental observation (shown

 in Figure 4.18) is achieved. However, lowering the value of C TD leads to overestimation of 
the liquid axial velocity.

The influence  of the turbulent dispersion force model on the gas holdup distributions can 
be seen in Figure 4.1 4. When C TD=0, the plume travels through the central region between 
the internals and between the internal and the column wall, which limits the dispersion an d 
leads to an asymmetric radial profile for the gas holdup in the central region as shown in 
Figure 4.14. This also leads to overestimation of radial gas holdup peak by 42.3% in the 
central region and about 17% in the region between the internal and the co lumn wall  as 
compared to  when C TD=0.1 is employed . When employing the turbulent dispersion model 
proposed by Simonin et al., the gas plume seems to disperse, which lowers the gas holdup 
peak. When increasing the turbulent dispersion coefficient from 0.1 to  0.3, the gas holdup 
at the wall increases. In comparison, the gas holdups obtained with C TD=0.1 are close to 
the experimental data. The radial gas distribution within the column is depicted in Figure 
4.15.

4.3.2  Reactor hydrodynamics, flow patterns and turbulence 
parameters variations with  the flow regime transition  
In this study, the discrete PBM is used to carry out the two -phase numerical simulations in 
a hollow bubble column react or. The simulations are carried out in bubbly flow, transition 
and churn -turbulent regimes at superficial gas velocities of 0.04 m/s, 0.10 m/s and 0.30 
m/s, respectively. For the flow regime transition studies, the interfacial forces are kept the 
same for  all flow regimes and they are listed in Table 4.2. The Reynolds Stress Model 
(RSM) with the dispersed formulation is used as the turbulence model in the current study. 
The parameters used in the PBM model, such as number of bins, bin sizes and the choice 
of kernels, are outlined in Table 4.3. The centerline liquid velocities obtained from the 
simulation in all the flow regimes  are validated against experimental data of Chen et al. 
(1999 ), Jhawar and Prakash (2014 ) and Al Mesfer et al.  (2017 ). The predicted overall  gas

(Hamed , 2010) Kagumba , 2013 , Jhawar and Prakash , 2014  , Guan et al. ,2015 , and Al

experimental values using visual photography technique  (Appendix – D).

Variations of axial liquid velocities in the radial direction for the bubble column with 15 
vertical internals are shown in Figure 4.16.  The trend in the radial distribution of axial 
liquid velocities is similar to that seen in experimental observations. An upward flow of 
the liquid between the internals is noticed and a reverse flow between the internal and 
column wall is noted. The flow inversion takes place at the internal wall. When the 
superficial gas velocity increases from 0.04 to 0.1 m/s, the centerline liquid ve locity 
increases from 0.377 m/s to 0.567 m/s, respectively. At a superficial gas velocity of 0.3 
m/s, the  centerline liquid velocity is 0.856 m/s. It should also be pointed out here that  the 
center line liquid velocities with the concentric tube internals  are about 30% higher than 171 
 
 those in the hollow bubble column (Figure 3.26).  This is due to tunneling effect of the 
internals, which directs the large bubbles and their associated wake to pass through the 
central region.  Variations of axial liquid velociti es in the radial direction for the bubble 
column with 38 vertical internals are shown in Figure 4.17 . It can be observed that radial 
profiles are flatter at the center than those in the single tube bundle column and the second 
tube bundle is clearly affect ing the profile of the inverted flow. It is observed that the radial 
profiles between the second internal and the column wall are relatively flat.

A comparison of centerline liquid axial velocities with the experimental data from Jhawar 
and Prakash (2014), Al Mesfer et al. (2017) and Chen et al. (1999) is shown in Figure 4.18 . 
A good agreement between the experimental and numerical results can be see n. In the 
bubbly regime, the centerline liquid velocity in the bubble column with 15 -tube internals 
is close to that in the bubble column with 38 -tube internals. However, for higher superficial 
gas velocities, the centerline liquid velocities in the bubble  column with 38 -tube internals 
are higher than those in the bubble column with 15 -tube internals. This is due to the 
decrease in the flow area  if there are more tubes in the column, which results in a higher 
velocity.

Figure 4.18 Comparison of the centerline liquid velocit ies  with the experimental data  in 
different  transition regimes  
The v ariations of gas holdups in the radial direction for the bubble column with 15 tubes  
are shown in Figure 4.19 . Such trends in the radial distribution of gas holdups between 
internals were described  by Sultan  et al.  (2018b) . In the core region, the gas holdups are 
higher than those between the internal and column wall.  In the proximity of the wall, the 
radial gas holdups are low due to the increased shear st ress. The downward liquid flow in 
the annular region entrains smaller bubbles (2 to 4 mm) due to their low rise velocities. 
This leads to increased residence time of the small bubbles in the region, which leads to 
higher gas holdups. It is noticed that the  local gas holdups increase when transitioning from 
the bubbly regime to the churn -turbulent regime, which is consistent with the experimental 
observations  of Sultan  et al.  (2018b) .   0.20.40.60.811.21.4

Figure 4.19 Comparison of gas holdup profiles in various transition regimes for the 
bubble column with 15 tubes ( single c ircular tube bundle)  
The radial profiles of the gas holdups in different  transition regimes for the bubble column 
with 38 tube internals are illust rated in Figure 4. 20. Similar to the case for the15 -tube 
column, the gas holdups are significantly increased with the increase in the superficial gas 
velocity. In the transition and churn turbulent regimes, higher gas holdup  values are noticed  
between the internals, and between the internal and column wall compared to those in the 
15-tube column. The trend  of the predicted radial profiles of the gas holdup is in line with 
the experimental observations by Bhusare et al.  (2018)  and Sultan  et al. ( 2018b) . The bulk 
circulation patterns in a bubble column are developed by the fast rising of larger bubbles 
and their wakes in the core region. The entrained liquid moves toward s the top of the bed, 
then flows down in the annular region, which entrains smaller bubbles into this region. Part 
of this down flow liquid can be pulled into the core region. However, this effect can be 
reduced due  the reduced flow area caused  in the presence of tube bundles . This can lead to

 greater accumulation of smaller bubbles in the annular region, which results in a higher gas 
holdup.   
 
Figure 4.20 Comparison o f gas holdup profiles in various transition regimes for bubble 
column with 38 tubes (Dense tube internals)  
Figure 4.21 shows the comparison between the predicted overall gas holdups are and the 
experimental data from Jhawar and Prakash  (2014) ; Kagumba (2013) ; Guan et al.  (2015)  
and Hamed  (2012) . It can be seen that an increase in  the overall gas holdups with the 
increase in the superficial gas velocity. For 15 tube internal column, at superficial gas 
velocities of 0.04 and 0.1 m/s, the overall gas holdups are close to the experimental values 
reported by Hamed  (2010), Kagumba (2013 ), Jhawar and Prakash (2014 ) , Guan et al.  
(2015 ), and Al Mesfer et al.  (2016). In the churn -turbulent regime, the gas holdup obtained 
by Jhawar and Prakash  (2014)  is lower than those attained in other studies. This could be 
attributed to various factors like difference in measurement technique, percentage of area

 occluded by internals and ave raging techniques. However, the numerical model has slightly 
overpredicted the overall gas holdup at U G=0.3 m/s, but it is close to that obtained by Guan 
et al.  (2015) . For the 38 tube internal column, in the transition regime  (UG=10 cm/s) , there 
is a slight increase in the overall gas holdup when compared to the 15 tube column. At a 
lower superficial gas velocity, the in crease is 22.45% followed by 16.31% and 15.94% at 
superficial gas velocities of 0.1 and 0.3 m/s, respectively. When the column is occluded 
with internals increases, the larger bubbles break into smaller bubbles. Small bubbles tend 
to increase the overall g as holdup in the column. In our experimentation, visual 
photographic method was employed to determine the overall gas holdups. At lower gas 
superficial velocities, the overall gas holdups are close  to the experimental data. At higher 
gas superficial veloci ties (U G>0.1 m/s), our experiments give a higher gas holdup. In the 
transition and churn turbulent regimes, more bubbles are produced near the disengagement 
region as a result of gas -liquid dispersion. In our visual technique, the foam generated was 
accoun ted for which results in higher values of overall gas holdup. The values have been 
presented after subtracting the height of foam layer.  177 
 
  
Figure 4.21 Comparison of the predicted overall gas holdups  in bubbly, transition  and 
churn -turbulent  regimes with experimental data  
The variations of turbulence parameters, of the turbulent viscosity ratio and turbulent 
Reynolds number, in the bubble columns with 15 and 38 tube internals are shown in 
Figures 4. 22 and 4.23, and Figures 4.2 4 and 4.2 5, respectively.  All RANS model accounts 
for the effect of turbulent eddies by determining the turbulent viscosity  (ANSYS, 2013) . 
Hence, finding turbulent viscosity ratio accurately account s for the presence of eddies  in 
the simulation.  The turbulen t Reynolds number is defined at the defined at the energy 
containing scale (𝑅𝑒𝑇=𝑘3/2/𝜀) (ANSYS, 2013) . A decrease in th e turbulent Reynolds 
number and turbulent viscosity ratio is noticed in the region occluded by internals as 
compared to the axial locations below the internals, which agree with the findings made in

A comparison of bubble faction distributions between the two bubble columns with 
different internal configurations is made for each flow regime and is illustrated in Figures 
4.26, 4.27 and 4.28, respectively. In all the flow regimes, it is noticed that fraction of small 
bubbles is high for the column with 38 internals. Also, the fraction of large bubbles is low 
for the column with 38 internals as compared to the column with15 internals. A hi gher 
break -up rate is apparent with the increase in the density of internals within the bubble 
column. These trends are similar to the experimental observations made by Thimmapuram 
et al.  (1993)  and Youssef et al.  (2012) . In a recent experimental study, Möller et al.  (2018)  
observed that increasing the density of the internals in the column gives a distinct 
difference in the peak of small bubbles at lower superficial gas velocities and the peak 
reduces with the increase in  superficial gas velocities.  It is worth noting that the difference 
in the peaks of small bubble fraction between the columns with 15 internals and 38 internals 
decreases when transitioning from the bubbly regime to the churn -turbulent regime.

The flow patterns near the bottom of the internals, bulk section and top region close to the 
disengagement zone in the column with 15 internals are illustrated in Figures 4.29, 4.30 
and 4.31, res pectively. In addition, Figures 4.32, 4.33 and 4.34 show the flow patterns near 
the bottom of the internals, bulk section and top region close to the disengagement zone in 
the column with 38 internals, respectively. A downward flow is noticed close to the wall 
region and an upward flow occurs in the core region between the internals. Near the bottom 
section of the internals in the column with 15 tubes, the liquid flowing downward near the 
wall region flows to the core region via the gaps between the tubes a nd through the circular 
tube bundle opening. Near the bulk section of the internals in the column with15 tubes, the 
liquid flows from the core region to the region close to the wall via the gaps between the 
tubes and the liquid then flows in a downward dir ection. Close to the dynamic height in 
the column with15 tubes, funneling patterns are noticed in which some of the liquid follows 
upward and the rest flows in between the tube gaps where the liquid flows in a downward 
183 
 
 direction. When the density of intern als in the column increases, the flow patterns within 
the bubble column are close to those noticed in the column with less internals. However, a 
higher degree of mixing is noticed when the internal density increases as shown in Figure 
4.35. When an extra t ube bundle is added parallel to the existing tube bundle, the liquid 
flows between the tube gaps of the outer bundle to the tube gaps in the inner bundle and 
vice versa which increases the liquid circulations within the column. A generalized flow 
mapping f or bubble columns with 15 tube and 38 tube internals is depicted in Figure 4.36.

 4.4 Conclusion  
In the present work, the effect of internals on the flow hydrodynamics has been thoroughly 
investigated. The influence of the lift force and turbulence dispersion on the numerical 
solution has been studied. The zero lift force model  can predict  the  gas ho ldup and liquid 
axial velocit y distributions reasonably well . Simonin turbulence dispersion model is able 
to effectively predict the dispers ion of  the gas phase and give good  gas holdup and liquid 
axial velocit y distributions . The presence of an additiona l bundle results in flatter liquid 
velocity profiles in the column center.  Higher axial liquid velocity  and gas holdup are 
noticed with the addition of a second internal tube. This leads to greater accumulation of 
small bubbles , which adds to the  gas holdu p. Lower turbulence parameters in the bulk 
region are attributed to the dissipation of turbulent eddies in the presence of internals. A 
higher fraction of small bubbles is noticed in the presence of more  internals , which 
indicates an increased rate of bubb le break -up in the column.

5 Conclusions and Future Scope  
The conclusions obtained from the CFD study of hollow bubble column and bubble column 
with internals have been presented. Subsequently, the future scope of the current study has 
been discussed.  
5.1 Conclusion  
5.1.1  Hollow Bubble Column  
• The effect of interfacial forces has been thoroughly studied and an appropriate 
selection of the interfacial model has been utilized to study the effect of flow regime 
transitions in hollow bubble columns. Constant lift force model with negative lift 
force coefficient was found to closely pr edict local gas holdups and liquid axial 
velocity plots as compared to the Tomiyama and Saffman -Mei models. The 
addition of Troshko -Hassan bubble induced turbulence model led to homogeneity 
in the gas holdup profiles. When turbulent dispersion model was ad ded, gas plume 
was dispersed throughout the cross section of the bubble column. Simonin model, 
with C TD=0.1, outperformed the Burns et al. model in predicting the local gas 
holdup and liquid axial velocity profiles. In the drag model study, Schiller -
Nauman n model outperformed the other drag models in the prediction of local and 
overall gas holdup values.  
• In the flow transition studies, an increase in liquid axial velocities and centerline 
liquid velocities was observed with an increase in superficial gas v elocity. These 
have closely conformed to the experimental values. Radial and overall gas holdups 195 
 
 increased with an increase in superficial gas velocity  and the values closely 
correspond to experimental observations made in selected studies. Also, an increa se 
in turbulent viscosity ratios was noticed with increasing superficial gas velocity .  
• A comparison of normalized bubble number densities was made, and an increase 
in large bubble fractions was noticed with increasing superficial gas velocity. 
Liquid circ ulations have been studied across the distributor, bulk and the 
disengagement zone and a generalized flow circulation mapping profile has been 
generated for hollow bubble columns. A close fit was observed when this was 
compared with experimental studies ca rried out by (Devanathan, Moslemian and 
Dudukovic, 1990) . 
• When various bubble breakup and coalescence models were tested, a combination 
of Luo breakup model and Luo coalescenc e model exhibited realistic fractional 
bubble distributions. At higher velocities, this combination was able to effectively 
account for the presence of large bubbles in the dispersion which conforms to the 
experimental observations. When Lehr breakup model  was employed, an increase 
in the breakup rate was observed which is evident from the increased fraction of 
smaller bubbles in the dispersion. Dual bubble size models based on the work of 
Krishna and Ellenberger, 1996  was able to effectively predict the local gas holdups, 
liquid axial velocities and overall gas holdups. The absence of PBM in the Dual 
bubble size model did not hinder the effective estimation of any of the 
hydrodynamic parameters.  196 
 
 5.1.2  Bubble Column with Vertical Internals  
• The influence of lift force and turbulence dispersion on the hydrodynamic 
parameters has been studied. When negative lift force coefficients were used, 
higher centerline liquid velocities were obtained,  and positive lift force coefficients 
underestimated the centerline liquid velocities values. In comparison, the absence 
of lift force (C L=0) in the formulation estimated reasonable values of local gas 
holdups and liquid axial velocities. Simonin turbulence dispersion model with 
coefficient of turbulence dispersion, C TD=0.1, was able to effectively disperse the 
gas phase and predicted sensible values of local gas holdups and liquid axial 
velocities.  
• As seen in hollow bubble columns, in the presence of internals too, the centerline 
liquid veloci ties increased with increase in superficial gas velocities. For similar 
superficial gas velocities, the centerline liquid velocity increased with the increase 
in internal tube density. Due to the presence of an additional tube bundle, a flatter 
liquid velo city profile was observed in the column center.  
• Higher radial and overall gas holdups were noticed with the addition of a second 
internal tube which is attributed to the decrease in flow area  on the gas dispersion 
offered by the tube bundles. This leads t o greater accumulation of small bubbles 
which adds to the holdup.  
• Lower values of turbulence parameters in the bulk region was attributed to the 
dissipation of turbulent eddies in the presence of internals.  
• A higher fraction of small bubbles was noticed in the presence of denser internals 
which indicates an increased rate of bubble break -up in the column.  197 
 
 5.2 Future Scope  
• Future studies could investigate effects of internals on heat and mass transfer effects 
in bubble columns as well determine limiting intern als density. Mixing and mass 
transfer could be coupled and the effect of interfacial forces like drag force, lift, 
turbulence dispersion and turbulence interaction model on the mixing time can be 
further investigated  
• Since, the process of heat transfer and  hydrodynamics are closely related, it would 
be interesting to study them simultaneously with increasing density of internals in 
bubble column. This could include investigating the effect of temperature on the 
bubble size distributions, local heat flux and  other hydrodynamic parameters.  
• The modelling approach employed for bubble column with internals can be 
extended to test the effect of other internals such as helical coils, circular plates, 
circular baffles and vibrating internals. The results obtained co uld be verified with 
a number of experimental studies that have tested the effect of these internals on 
the reactor hydrodynamics  
• The suitability of Method of Moments (MOM) which includes Quadrature Method 
of Moments (QMOM) and (DQMOM) on bubble properties  could be tested  
• The application of Dual Bubble Size modelling approach for the churn turbulent 
regime could be extensively investigated and validated with literature studies  
• The effect of high pressure on bubble properties such as Sauter mean diameter, 
bubble size distributions and bubble velocities could be an addition to the current 
study  198

Experimental Evaluation of Overall Gas Holdup  
Experimental Methods  
Experiments were carried out in the presence of circular tube bundle internals. The air flow 
rate was controlled by three calibrated sonic nozzles. These experiments were carried out 
at a static height of 1. 4 meters and the range of superficial gas velocit y was 0.02 m/s to 0.3 
m/s.  Tap water as  used a continuous phase and air flow was used as the dispersed  phase . 
Gas was introduced into the column  through  a six arm sparger with 11.2 cm long arm and 
holes of the sparger oriented  in the downward direction.   A visual measurement technique 
was employed to determine t he overall gas holdup values (Equation 1). The variation of 
dynamic height was captured  by using the Canon  Powershot SX50 HS camera . The 
experimental details such as column details, sparger design, and working of gas flow 
control have been outlined elsewhere (Gandhi  et al.  1999; Li and Prakash, 2000; Jhawar 
and Praka sh, 2014; George  et al.,  2017) .

Results and Discussion  
Overall gas holdup values and its comparison with experimental data has been presented 
in Figure D-1. At lower velocities, the values of overall gas holdup closely corresponded 
to other experimental values  of Jhawar and Prakash (2014) ;Kagumba (2013) ;Guan et al.  
(2015)  and Hamed  et al.  (2010). At higher velocities (U G>0.1 m/s), our experiments 229 
 
 portrayed a higher gas holdup. In the transition and churn turbulent regime, higher amount 
of foam is pro duced near the disengagement region as a result of gas -liquid dispersion. In 
our visual technique, the foam generated was accounted for which results in higher values 
of overall gas holdup. The values have been presented after subtracting the height of foa m 
layer.
