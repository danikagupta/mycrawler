INTRODUCTION 
Remimazolam besylate (Byfavo injection, Korea) is a water-soluble, fast-acting γ-aminobu -
tyric acid A GABA-A agonist commonly used as an intravenous (IV) benzodiazepine (BDZ). 
Remimazolam was initially developed as a “soft drug” of the BDZ class to enhance GABA-A 
receptor activity through adding a carboxylic ester moiety into the BDZ. Metabolization 
of remimazolam shows that it is rapidly hydrolyzed to an inactive metabolite (CNS 7054) 
through non-specific tissue esterase activity. This drug is expected to be relatively safe with 
regard to potential risk of cardiovascular depression complications and does not require spe -
cific reduced dosing for older adults or for patients with renal or hepatic impairment patients 
except for those with severe liver dysfunction. Additionally, it can be reversed by flumazenil. 
Remimazolam was recently approved as a general anesthetic for adults in January 2021 in 
South Korea, and for use in procedural sedation for less than 30 minutes in August 2021 [1,2]. 
This drug is now widely used in other countries, as it was approved as a general anesthetic in 
January 2020 in Japan, as a procedural sedative in July 2020 in the United States and China Remimazolam is a novel intravenous ultra-short acting benzodiazepine that has the potential of 
being a safe and effective new sedative for use in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Because remi -
mazolam metabolizes rapidly by being hydrolyzed to an inactive metabolite (CNS 7054) through 
non-specific tissue esterase activity, specific dosing adjustment for older adults and for patients 
with renal or hepatic impairment patients (except for those with severe hepatic impairment) is not 
required. In addition, research has shown that remimazolam may be reversed by administration of 
flumazenil, as its half time was sufficiently short compared to flumazenil. It shows a lower inci -
dence of cardiorespiratory depression, less injection pain, and no fatal complications such as 
propofol infusion syndrome and malignant hyperthermia of inhalational anesthetics. Future studies 
to study the suitability of remimazolam for managing the sedation of ICU patients who need seda -
tion for a long time over several days is required.

and in March 2021 in Europe, and as compassionate use med -
ication in intensive care unit (ICU) sedation in August 2020 in 
Belgium [3]. In this review, we will introduce remimazolam as 
a novel BDZ to be predictive to be useful and safe in the ICU 
sedation, especially deep sedation. 
ICU SEDATION 
Sedation can be problematic in terms of delirium. No or light 
sedation seems to be related to improved patient outcomes, 
more days free of mechanical ventilation, and shorter hospi -
tal stays [4,5]. However, light sedation protocol could cause 
accidental extubation of endotracheal tubes and loss of other 
important instruments, as well as aggravate anxiety, pain, 
and post-traumatic stress disorder [6]. Pain control has been 
thought to proceed sedation in the ICU because inadequate 
analgesia was related with worsening stress, sleep deprivation, 
delirium, cognitive dysfunction, and extreme anxiety [7,8]. 
Deep sedation with or without using neuromuscular block -
ing agents in the ICU has been used for anxiolysis and amne -
sia in mechanically ventilated patients, particularly those with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9,10]. However, 
deep sedation might lead to over-sedation, which can be as -
sociated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation 
[9]. 
The use BDZ for sedation in the ICU remains controversial. 
BDZs are well-established drugs that are inexpensive and 
provide powerful anxiolysis and amnesia. However, sedation 
using non-BDZ drugs has been shown to improve the clinical 
outcome of critically ill patients better than BDZs in terms of 
incidence of delirium and prolonged, and unpredicted seda -
tion [ 11,12]. We compared sedatives that can be used for deep 
sedation in the ICU in  Table 1 . ■ Remimazolam is a novel intravenous ultra-short acting 
benzodiazepine, which can be reversed by flumazenil.
■ Dosing adjustment for older adults and for patients with 
renal or liver impairment patients (except for those with 
severe hepatic impairment) are not required because 
remimazolam is rapidly metabolized by tissue esterase.
■ Use of remimazolam results in a lower incidence of car -
diorespiratory depression and less pain at injection site, 
as well as no fatal adverse effects such as propofol infu -
sion syndrome and malignant hyperthermia of volatile 
anesthetics.KEY MESSAGES
IV SEDATIVES AND DEEP SEDATION IN ICU 
Propofol 
Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic medication used for sedation 
in the ICU; it has various sedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvul -
sant properties, and its use has been shown to help reduce 
intracranial pressure [13,14]. Propofol provides a rapid onset 
of action within seconds after administration and a short 
duration of action up to 15 minutes. However, propofol has 
several risks. First, its formulation must be prepared in a lipid 
solution, which increases the risk of bacterial contamination 
and could be associated with fatal infectious disease [15,16]. 
Second, patients have been reported to experience pain on IV 
injection. Third, propofol is associated with a higher risk of 
cardiorespiratory depression compared to other IV sedatives 
like dexmedetomidine, ketamine, and midazolam. Finally, 
propofol has been associated with fatal “propofol infusion 
syndrome (PRIS)” [17]. PRIS is a rare syndrome which affects 
patients undergoing long-term treatment with high doses of 
propofol and causes cardiac and renal failure, rhabdomyoly -
sis, metabolic acidosis. The safe dose of propofol infusion is

considered to be 1–4 mg/kg/hr for sedation in intensive care. 
However, fatal cases of PRIS have been reported after infusion 
doses as low as 1.9–2.6 mg/kg/hr. Propofol can be relatively 
safe and an ideal anesthetics for several minute up to sever -
al hours of surgery, but physicians must keep in mind that 
propofol infusion can cause PRIS in cases of prolonged contin -
uous infusion in the ICU [18]. 
Midazolam 
Midazolam is an amnesic and sedative BDZ, and had been 
shown to have an onset of 3–5 minutes and a recovery period 
of 2 hours before remimazolam approval. It is considered safe 
to use, and the risk of cardiorespiratory depression caused 
by the use of midazolam is much lower than that of propofol. 
However, midazolam accumulation can occur via repeated 
injection or prolonged continuous infusion, leading to un -
predictably prolonged sedation associated with delirium [19]. 
Critically ill patients also sometime present with an altered 
mental state caused by a neurological event such as intracra -
nial hemorrhage, infarction, or seizure. Intensivists could face 
challenging situations distinguishing this “real neurological 
emergency” from the after-effects of prolonged sedation with 
classic BDZs. 
Critically ill patients also commonly have chronic renal fail -
ure and experience acute kidney injury. Active metabolites of 
midazolam can accumulate in patients with renal failure and 
lead to longer-than-expected sedation of these patients, as 
conjugated metabolites of midazolam have significant phar -
macological activity [20]. Prolonged sedation can occur due to 
active metabolites of midazolam and an impaired metabolism 
on the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 [21].  
Dexmedetomidine  
Dexmedetomidine, a high-affinity adrenergic agonist of the 
alpha2 receptor, provides light sedation and pain relief in 
patients in the ICU. Dexmedetomidine is associated with 
more days free of mechanical ventilation, a shorter time in a 
coma-like state, and less risk of delirium [22-24]. Additionally, 
dexmedetomidine has been shown to reduce the incidence 
of delirium, prevent delirium, and improve mortality [25-28]. 
However, hypotension and bradycardia are common side ef -
fects of dexmedetomidine [29-31]. Dexmedetomidine can be 
used a sole anesthetic for deep sedation or general anesthesia 
with a higher dose (5–10 times the maximum recommended 
dose for procedural sedation). However, deep sedation with a 
large dose of dexmedetomidine is rarely applied generally due to its associated risks of hypotension and bradycardia, particu -
larly in critically ill patients [32]. 
Volatile Agents 
Inhalational anesthetic agents are often used for general anes -
thesia, as they are potent sedatives which show a fast elimina -
tion, limited hepatic metabolism, and no accumulation [33]. 
Volatile sedation in the ICU has been tried more frequently 
after solving technical problems since the development of 
inhalational anesthetic devices, such as AnaConDa (SEDANA 
Medical, Uppsala, Sweden) and Mirus (Pall Medical, Dreieich, 
Germany) [33,34]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
randomized controlled trials showed that ICU sedation with 
volatile anesthetic agents relative to classic IV sedatives, like 
propofol or midazolam, reduced the awakening time from se -
dation by 80 minutes and the extubation time by 196 minutes. 
Despite such benefits, no reductions in the length of stay in the 
ICU or hospital were reported [34]. 
However, the use of inhalational sedation in the ICU remains 
limited. The reasons for this limited usage may be associated 
with the unfamiliarity of medical staff to inhalational agents 
and their methods of administration; patients’ higher risk of 
agitation, nausea, and vomiting after awakening; potential at -
mospheric contamination; and a rare, but fatal, complication 
known as malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia 
is a life-threatening reaction to potent inhalation agents (such 
as halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane), and 
the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine. Malignant 
hyperthermia show a hypermetabolic crisis such as extremely 
high body temperature, rigid muscles or muscle spasms, hy -
perkalemia, high oxygen consumption, high CO2 production, 
multiple vital organ failure, and disseminated intravascular 
coagulation [35]. 
DRUG INFORMATION AND MECHANISM OF 
ACTION OF REMIMAZOLAM 
Mechanism of Remimazolam Action 
Remimazolam has a high affinity on GABA-A receptors to bind 
at the interface between the alpha and gamma subunits, in -
ducing a highly inhibitory central nervous system. It binds to 
receptors to make the intracellular concentration of chloride 
ions increase; this is followed by cellular membrane hyper -
polarization and inhibitory conduction of the neuron action 
potentials to enhance the effects of GABA [36]. 154 https://www.accjournal.org Acute and Critical Care 2022 May 37(2):151-158Choi HR, et al.      Review of remimazolam and ICU sedatives
Pharmacokinetics 
Remimazolam is characterized by pharmacokinetics (PK) 
profiles, specifically a high clearance, a small steady-state 
volume of distribution, a short elimination half-life, a short 
context-sensitive half-life, and first-order linear PK. Time after 
administration to onset of remimazolam is 1–3 minutes; this is 
faster than that of midazolam [37], and the half time of remim -
azolam is 7–8 minutes, which is much less than that of midaz -
olam [36]. 
In a phase 1 PK study with healthy volunteers who were 
given a single dose of remimazolam, the mean residence time 
for remimazolam was 0.50 hours and the mean residence time 
for midazolam was 3.56 hours, as the systemic clearance of 
midazolam is about one-third that of remimazolam and the 
volume of distribution is more than twice that of midazolam 
[38,39]. This difference in PK between remimazolam and mid -
azolam could explain one factor in patients’ rapid recovery 
after receiving remimazolam. There is no clear relationship 
between body weight and systemic clearance of remimazolam 
within the studied body weight range (60–100 kg) [39]. There 
may be no significant benefit for dosing by body weight com -
pared to fixed doses [ 39], The PK profiles were similar to those 
in a single-dose phase 1 PK study with continuous infusion of 
remimazolam and midazolam [ 40]. 
Carboxylesterase enzymes can be found in the cytosol and 
the rough endoplasmic reticulum of tissues [41], and remi -
mazolam is metabolized by this tissue esterase (particularly, 
the liver) to an inactive carboxy acid metabolite, CNS 7054 
[5,12,13]. CNS 7054 has a PK profile with a smaller volume of 
distribution, slower clearance rate, and a longer mean resi -
dence time in comparison to remimazolam [42], and has a 
400-fold lower affinity for the GABA-A receptor [43]. An ad -
ditional study found that there was no significant difference 
between older adults (median age, 66.0 years) versus younger 
adults (median age, 21.0 years) in terms of PK profile of remi -
mazolam [44]. 
One study involved the use of a simulated plasma PK after 
a 10 mg remimazolam bolus, and revealed no significant dif -
ferent in Cmax values among hepatic impairment patients 
groups [45]. There was no difference between liver dysfunction 
and healthy subjects in the incidence and duration of loss of 
consciousness. However, recovery from sedation was delayed 
by hepatic impairment. This demonstrated that carboxyles -
terase enzymes–1A in liver must have an important role in 
metabolism of remimazolam. As recovery from sedation in 
severely hepatic impaired patients was delayed, specifically re -duced dosing for these patients can be considered. In contrast, 
no dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or mod -
erate hepatic failure [45]. Remimazolam is not metabolized by 
cytochrome P-450 isozymes, nor does it inhibit cytochrome 
P-450 metabolism [46]. 
In one study, 80% of the dose of remimazolam was excret -
ed in urine as an inactive metabolite, and less than 1% of the 
dose was detected as unchanged 24 hours after remimazol -
am injection. Remimazolam indicated no accumulation in 
patients with renal impairment, and was metabolized at the 
same rate as that of healthy volunteers. There was no need to 
adjust the dosing of remimazolam in patients with impaired 
renal function, as renal function does not affect the PK of 
remimazolam [ 45]. 
Pharmacodynamics 
To determine a level of sedation in study of anesthetics, re -
searchers use commonly the Modified Observer’s Assessment 
of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S) and Bispectral Index 
(BIS) of electroencephalogram. MOAA/S is scored 0–5, where 
5 represents an alert subject who responds promptly to their 
name spoken in a normal tone, and 0 represents a patient with 
no response after a painful trapezius squeeze. BIS index which 
ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the absence of brain 
activity, and 100 represents the fully awake state. Generally, 
BIS values between 40 to 60 meant adequate general anesthe -
sia for a surgery [40]. 
In the phase 1 pharmacodynamic study with healthy volun -
teers who were given a single dose of remimazolam, the dose 
was escalated throughout the cohorts until cohort 9 (0.30 mg/
kg) was reached and six of 10 subjects (60%) in this cohort ex -
perienced loss of consciousness (MOAA/S scores of <2) for a 
minimum of five minutes, which was the predefined stopping 
criterion for dose escalation. In contrast, subjects in the place -
bo group did not experience sedation [39]. 
In this study, the onset of sedation was fast for both midaz -
olam and remimazolam (at doses of >0.05 mg/kg). The degree 
and duration of sedation with remimazolam showed dose 
dependency, and the peak effect of sedation was observed in 
1–4 minutes following the start of the infusion. Administration 
of a 0.10–0.20 mg/kg dose of remimazolam resulted in deeper 
sedation and faster recovery from sedation in comparison with 
administration of a 0.075 mg/kg dose of midazolam [39].  
Subjects showed no sedation, or very minimal sedation, at 
0.01 and 0.025 mg/kg, and showed small reductions in MOAA/
S scores (to 4) and BIS scores (to 75) at 0.05 mg/kg. Doses of 155 https://www.accjournal.org Acute and Critical Care 2022 May 37(2):151-158Choi HR, et al.      Review of remimazolam and ICU sedatives
0.075 mg/kg and higher resulted in deeper sedation, as evi -
denced by MOAA/S scores of <2 and mean BIS scores of 60 [39]. 
SAFETY DATA 
Blood pressure decreased (24%±6%) and heart rate increased 
(28%±15%) during remimazolam infusion. The Spo2 decreased 
during the first 5 minutes of remimazolam infusion, but this 
was successfully treated by oxygen administration through 
a nasal cannula with a median duration of 42 minutes, or by 
chin lift with a median duration of 26 minutes. No significant 
effect of remimazolam on the PR interval and on QRS duration 
was observed from the analysis of the 12-lead Holter electro -
cardiogram. Involuntary movements, psychomotor hyperac -
tivity, cough, hiccup, sneezing, and apnea (lasting 0.9 minutes) 
were also observed. All adverse events were classified as mild 
or moderate (not severe) [38,40]. 
Remimazolam may enhance the central nervous system 
depressant activities of other BDZs, barbiturates, ketamine, 
propofol dexmedetomidine, inhalational anesthetics, halo -
peridol, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or opioids, 
such as remifentanil and fentanyl. The therapeutic efficacy 
of Remimazolam decreases when used in combination with 
Aminophylline or theophylline [47]. Since remimazolam con -
tains dextran 40, it is contraindicated in patients with a history 
of severe hypersensitivity to dextran 40 [48]. Remimazolam 
reacts with Ringer’s acetate or lactate solution and forms 
a precipitate; thus, it is recommended that Remimazolam 
be used only in combination with saline. In addition, when 
co-administration is essential, using a low concentration of 
remimazolam and a high injection rate of Ringer’s solution is 
preferred [ 49]. 
FLUMAZENIL REVERSAL 
Flumazenil was approved as a reversal of BDZ, an antagonist 
to the positive allosteric modulator effects of BDZs at the GA -
BA-A receptor. The presences of a reversal agent enhanced a 
safety in cases of overdose or adverse events. However, fluma -
zenil has a shorter half-life and duration of action than most 
classic BDZ drugs. Therefore, in cases of prolonged sedation 
by classic BDZ drugs, flumazenil was used for distinguishing 
the oversedation by BDZ and other significant neurological in -
jury or impairment because re-sleeping after several minutes 
occurred after reversal of flumazenil [50]. 
As the half time of remimazolam was thought to be suffi -ciently short to be reversed by a single dose of flumazenil, use 
of flumazenil for reversal of remimazolam or to control seda -
tion levels by remimazolam was expected. However, re-sleep -
ing issue was demonstrated as case reports for remimazolam 
after flumazenil reversal. In particular, further study into the 
efficacy of flumazenil reversal of remimazolam following long 
duration ICU sedation is required. 
CLINICAL USE 
Procedure Sedation 
Remimazolam had a sufficiently safe and sedative effect to use 
for procedures like endoscopy. Induction doses of 5 mg were 
administered intravenously over a period of 1 minute and 2.5 
mg supplemental doses for 15 seconds can be administered 
within a least 2-minute interval [51]. Compared with the other 
sedatives, remimazolam demonstrated a higher sedative effi -
ciency than that of midazolam and lower than that of propofol 
[52-56]. Remimazolam showed a lower incidence of hypo -
tension than midazolam, and no significant differences were 
observed in hypoxia, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, and injec -
tion site pain. Compared with propofol, remimazolam showed 
a significantly lower incidence of hypotension, hypoxemia, 
and pain at injection site; however, there were no differences 
in the incidence of bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting [ 57,58].  
General Anesthesia  
Remimazolam was used as a general anesthetic, using induc -
tion doses of 6 and 12 mg/kg/hr and maintenance rates of 1 
mg/kg/hr. Remimazolam was superior to propofol in terms of 
its efficacy for general anesthesia, and it showed a significant -
ly lower incidence of hypotension and other adverse events 
[37,59,60]. 
Sedation of Patients in ICUs 
Phase II trial of Ono pharmaceutical company about 49 ICU 
patients sedated with remimazolam, all patients were report -
ed to be sedated successfully and have no significant adverse 
events, and seven out of 49 ICU patients were sedated with 
remimazolam for >24 hours. However, on analyzing samples 
24 hours or more after starting the continuous infusion, a high -
er concentration of remimazolam was observed than expected 
[61]. The suitability and safety of remimazolam for prolonged 
sedation of ICU patients’ needs to be tested in the future. A few 
clinical trials on sedating patients in ICUs with remimazolam 
are ongoing or completed to recruit patients.; however, the re -156 https://www.accjournal.org Acute and Critical Care 2022 May 37(2):151-158Choi HR, et al.      Review of remimazolam and ICU sedatives
sults of the trials have not been published yet (national clinical 
trial number: NCT04611425, NCT04815265) [62]. One study 
involving general anesthesia (5 hours) and postoperative seda -
tion (18 hours) using remimazolam showed that postoperative 
sedation with a continuous infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/hr remima -
zolam with infusion of remifentanil provided optimal sedation 
of ICU patients [47]. 
CONCLUSION 
Remimazolam is very promising as a safe and effective sedative 
in ICU patients. It is expected that remimazolam can be used 
for not only light sedation for general ICU patients and but also 
deep sedation for severe ARDS, although studies for dosing 
adjustments for the specific medical conditions of ICU patients 
are required. As remimazolam is metabolized rapidly by tissue 
esterase, dose adjustment for age and for renal and hepatic im -
pairment (except for severe liver dysfunction) was not required. 
This drug has a lower incidence of cardiovascular collapse and 
respiratory distress, and no fatal complication such as PRIS of 
propofol and malignant hyperthermia of volatile anesthetics 
have been reported. This profile seems to be suitable for criti -
cally ill patients, although future studies are required.
