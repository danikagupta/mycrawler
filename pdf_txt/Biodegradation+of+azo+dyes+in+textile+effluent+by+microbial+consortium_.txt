ABSTRACT 
Release of textile azo dyes to the environment is an issue of health concern while the use of 
microorganisms has proved to be  the best option for remediati on. Thus, in the present study, a 
bacterial consortium consisting of Providencia rettgeri  s t r a i n  H S L 1  a n d  Pseudomonas sp.  
SUK1 has been investigated for degradation an d detoxification of structurally different azo 
dyes. The consortium showed 98-99 % decolorizat ion of all the selected azo dyes viz. Reac-
tive Black 5 (RB 5), Reactive Orange 16 (RO 16 ), Disperse Red 78 (DR 78) and Direct Red 
81 (DR 81) within 12 to 30 h at 100 mg L-1 concentration at 30 ± 0.2 °C under microaero-
philic, sequential aerobic/microaerophilic and microaerophilic/aerobic processes. However, 
decolorization under microaerophilic conditions viz. RB 5 (0.26 mM), RO 16 (0.18 mM), DR 
78 (0.20 mM) and DR 81 (0.23 mM) and sequentia l aerobic/microaeroph ilic processes viz. 
RB 5 (0.08 mM), RO 16 (0.06 mM), DR 78 ( 0.07 mM) and DR 81 (0.09 mM) resulted into 
the formation of aromatic amines. In distinct ion, sequential microaer ophilic/ aerobic process 
doesn’t show the formation of amines. Additi onally, 62-72 % reduction in total organic car-
bon content was observed in all the dyes deco lorized broths under sequential microaero-
philic/aerobic processes suggesting the efficacy of method in mineraliza tion of dyes. Notable 
induction within the levels of azoreductase and NADH-DCIP reductase (97 and 229 % for RB 
5, 55 and 160 % for RO 16, 63 and 196 % for DR 78, 108 and 258 % for DR 81) observed under sequential microaerophilic/aer obic processes suggested thei r critical involvements in 
the initial breakdown of azo bonds, whereas, a slig ht increase in the le vels of laccase and 
veratryl alcohol oxidase confirmed subsequent  oxidation of formed amines. Also, the acute 
toxicity assay with Daphnia magna  revealed the nontoxic nature of the dye-degraded metabo-
lites under sequential microaerophilic/aerobic pr ocesses. As biodegradation under sequential 
microaerophilic/aerobic process completely detoxifi ed all the selected textile azo dyes, further EXCLI Journal 2015;14:158-174 – ISSN 1611-2156

INTRODUCTION 
Textile dyes are chemicals of complex 
aromatic structures designed to resist the im-pact of detergents, sunshine and tempera-tures (Nigam et al., 1996). They are chemi-cally and photochemically stable and are ex-tremely persistent in natural atmospheres. The world-wide annual production of syn-thetic textile dyestuff has been estimated to 
be over 1 x 10
6 ton (Pandey et al., 2007). 
More than 10,000 different commercially available dyes are used in textile industry for dyeing and printing purposes (Meyer, 1981; Kadam et al., 2011). Th e fixation rates of 
several textile dyes are not 100 % and around 30-70 % of the amount of dyestuff used to get eliminated into effluent during the wet processing opera tions (Khaled et al., 
2009; Bumpus, 1995). The estimated dyes concentration in the textile effluent has been reported to be in the range of 10-200 mg L
-1 
(Kadam et al., 2011).  
Textile dyes are chemically diverse in 
nature and are broadly divided into azo, reac-
tive, triphenylmethane, heterocyclic, poly-meric structures, et c (Cheunbarn et al., 
2008). Among these various types, the azo dyes constitute about 70 % and are used widely for dyeing purposes. This makes them the largest and most important group of synthetic colorants released into the envi-ronment (Ambrósio and Campos-Takaki, 2004). In order to satisfy the standards nec-essary for industrial ap plications like stabil-
ity and long lasting of colorants, the azo dyes 
are manufactured with various colors, mo-
lecular structures and resistance to attenua-
tion upon exposure to sunlight, water and several chemicals (Correia et al., 1994). Azo dyes are of concern in textile wastewater treatment because its very small amount in water (10-50 mg L
-1) is highly visible and 
aromatic amines that occurred from azo re-duction are suspected to be carcinogenic and have toxic effect on organisms (Wong and Yu, 1999). The structures of azo dyes consist of coupling of diazotized amine with either associated amine or a phenol and additional-ly possess an azo bond (N = N). The dis-charge of such dyes in natural ecosystem re-sults into conversion of azo group to aro-matic amines and further bioaccumulation of such products could result in toxic impact on aquatic life and even carcinogenic and muta-genic effect on humans (Banat et al., 1996; Pinheiro et al., 2004). Azo dyes are known to inhibit the tyrosinase enzyme which may leads to inhibition of melanin synthesis and 
results in hypopigmentation (Dubey et al., 2007). The color of dyestuff in effluent inter-rupts the aquatic environment by reducing light penetration, gas so lubility and interfer-
ence of phytoplankton’s photosynthesis (Sharma, 2009). In addition, the discharge of untreated effluent into usable water resources 
like rivers and lakes alters pH scale and will increase BOD, COD and TOC values (Lade et al., 2012).  
The environmental legislation about the 
appearance of color in discharged effluent has forced the industr ies to treat dyestuff 
containing effluent themselves (Robinson et al., 2001). Additionally, limited supply and increasing cost of water for industrial sector has made the treatment and reuse of dyeing effluent mandatory to avoid environmental pollution and reduce production cost. A vari-ety of typical physico-chemical strategies such as coagulation, flocculation, activated 
carbon adsorption and reverse osmosis tech-nique are used for the removal of color from textile effluent. However, excessive use of EXCLI Journal 2015;14:158-174 – ISSN 1611-2156

160 chemicals in such conventional treatments 
produces large amount of sludge and does 
not remove all dyes, thus preventing recy-cling of treated effluent. In addition, excess use of chemicals requires high cost and re-sults into secondary pollution (Jadhav et al., 2007). These methods can only transfer the dyestuff from one phase to another leaving the problem essentially unsolved. Alterna-tively, the genetic diversity and metabolic versatility of microor ganisms makes them a 
biological option of treatment to remediate the pollution caused by dyes. Thus, the utili-
zation of microorganisms for degradation and detoxification of dyes changing into an important technique because it is cost effec-tive, eco-friendly and produces less amount of sludge (Banat et al., 1996; Robinson et al., 
2001). 
Microorganisms able to degrade azo dyes 
under microaerophilic conditions are known as azo linkages are easily reduced in such conditions (Tan et al., 1999). Few conven-tional aerobic textile wastewater treatments 
are reported as not able to degrade azo dyes (Shaul et al., 1991). Based on the available literature, it can be c oncluded that the micro-
bial decolorization of azo dyes is more effec-tive in sequential microaerophilic/aerobic and aerobic/microaerophilic processes (Fran-ciscon et al., 2009a; Waghmode et al., 2011, 2012). As in many cases the degradation me-tabolites produced in single microaerophilic condition are aromatic amines, which are toxic or even more toxic than parent azo dyes, thus require subs equent aerobic stage 
for their degradation (Hu, 2001). It has been demonstrated that reductive enzymes break down azo bond of azo dyes under microaer-ophilic conditions while oxidative enzyme works better at aerobic conditions which al-lows its possible decolorization and further detoxification of formed amines (Zimmer-man et al., 1982; Duran and Esposito, 2000). Therefore sequential mi croaerophilic/aerobic 
processes of azo dyes degradation become a promising approach for detoxification of tex-tile effluent.  In this context, th e present study reports 
the decolorization of four structurally differ-
ent textile azo dyes by a bacterial consortium 
consisting of P. rettgeri strain HSL1 and 
Pseudomonas sp.  SUK1 under microaero-
philic, aerobic, sequential aerobic/microaero-philic and microaerophili c/aerobic processes. 
The optimization of physico-chemical pa-rameters for enhanced decolorization of se-lected azo dyes was carried out by one pa-rameter at a time approach. The formation of aromatic amines was analyzed spectropho-tometrically, whereas the reduction in total organic carbon was estimated using the TOC analyzer under various incubation processes. 
Activities of dye degrading reductive and oxidative enzymes were determined by standard assays. The environmental impact of azo dyes and its degraded metabolites was assessed by monitoring the acute toxicity to 
Daphnia magna . 
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Textile dyestuff and chemicals 
The textile azo dyes viz. C.I. Reactive 
black 5 (RB 5), C.I. Reactive orange 16 (RO 16), C.I. Disperse red 78 (DR 78) and C.I. Direct red 81 (DR 81) were kindly provided 
by Mahesh Textile Processors, Ichalkaranji, India. The structural information of dyes is shown in Table 1. Veratryl alcohol, 2,2’-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), methyl red, nicotinamide ade-nine dinucleotide (NADH), dichlorophenol indophenols (DCIP) a nd dehydrated micro-
biological medium nutrient broth (NB) were obtained from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. Chloranil, Dimethyl-formamide and Aniline-2-sulfonic were pur-chased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

162 Pre-enrichment conditions 
Both the bacterial cultures P. rettgeri 
strain HSL1 and Pseudomonas sp.  SUK1 
were individually grown in 250 ml Erlen-meyer flask containing 100 ml of nutrient broth having composition g L
-1 of sodium 
chloride 5.0, beef extract 1.5, yeast extract 4.0 and peptic digest of animal tissue 5.0. The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 with 0.1 M HCL and/or 0.1 M NaOH, autoclaved at 121 
oC for 20 min, and sepa-
rately inoculated with 100 µl of 24 h old ac-tive cultures of bacterial strains. The enrich-ment was carried out for 24 h at 30 ± 0.2 
oC 
under microaerophilic conditions and then used as inoculum for further degradation studies. 
 
Optimization of decolorization conditions 
Decolorization experiments were con-
ducted in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask contain-ing 100 ml of individual pre-enriched P. 
rettgeri strain HSL1, Pseudomonas sp.  
SUK1 and equal amounts of both the cul-tures (50 ml of each) as bacterial consortium. The decolorization efficiency of individual cultures and bacterial consortium was inves-tigated with 100 mg L
-1 dyes concentration, 
initial broth pH of 7.0 (adjusted after pre-enrichment) and 30 ± 0.2 
oC of incubation 
temperature under microaerophilic condi-tions. The process parameters optimization for all the azo dyes decolorization by bacte-rial consortium were performed in microaer-ophilic conditions by one parameter at a time approach viz. initial pH of pre-enriched broth (3 to 12), incubation temperature (20, 30, 37, 40, 50 ± 0.2 
oC) and initial dye concentration 
(50 to 250 mg L-1). 
 
Decolorization at various processes 
For the sequential aerobic/micro-
aerophilic decolorization study, the azo dyes (100 mg L
-1) containing bacterial consortium 
broths were incubated at aerobic stage for the 
first half time as required in complete decol-orization under micr oaerophilic condition 
and then transferred to microaerophilic stage for subsequent decolorization for the next remaining time. Here, the aerobic process is 
defined as the incubation on orbital shaker at 
120 rpm. The same procedure was followed for decolorization under sequential micro-aerophilic/aerobic processes. Influence of single and sequential incubation stages on decolorization performance and formation of aromatic amines by bacterial consortium were investigated at optimized conditions (Waghmode et al., 2011; Franciscon et al., 2009a).  
At defined time of intervals, the aliquots 
of culture supernatant (3 ml) were withdrawn 
and suspended particles removed by adding equal volume of methanol followed by cen-trifugation at 7500 x g for 15 min at 4 ± 
0.2 
oC. The resulted supernatant was assayed 
spectrophotometrically by measuring the de-
crease in absorbance at respective dyes λmax 
(UV-vis spectrophotometer, Hitahi U-2800; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The control flasks as without dye or bacterial cultures were also tested under the same conditions. If other-wise mentioned, all decolorization experi-ments were performed in triplicate and de-colorization activity wa s expressed in terms 
of percent decolorizatio n using the formula:  
 
 
 
Determination of aromatic amines  
The aromatic amines formed in decolor-
ized broth were de termined spectrophoto-
metrically as per the method of Marik et al.  
(2003). Briefly, the broth samples were taken after decolorization un der microaerophilic, 
aerobic, sequential ae robic/microaerophilic 
and microaerophilic/aer obic processes, fro-
zen and freeze-dried in  Upright Freeze Dryer 
Model: FDU5003/8603 (Operon Co. Ltd, Korea). The freeze-dried samples (5 mg) were then dissolved in 5 ml of a 0.4 % chlo-ranil solution in dimethylformaminde (DMF) and heated to 100 ± 0.2 
oC for 5 min. The 
absorbance was measured spectrophotomet-rically at 560 nm. A cal ibration curve of ani-
line-2-sulfonic acid as  a model amine prod-
uct of azo dyes reduction was prepared and the concentration of sample amines was cal-100bb I iti l incubation after  absorbance Observed- absorbance Initial(%) tion Decoloriza(t) h)  (0 

163 culated in mM. The pre-enriched cultures in 
NB without dyes were used as control.  
 
Total organic carbon measurement 
The presence of organic carbon in the 
culture broth containing dyes was measured by estimating the total organic carbon (TOC) under different incubation conditions using the TOC analyzer (Hach DR 2700 spectro-photometer, Hach Co., USA) (Lade et al., 2012). The decolorized broth cultures were 
centrifuged at 7500 x g for 15 min and fil-
tered through 0.45 µm pore size filter to re-move bacterial cell debris. The removal ratio of TOC was calculated as follows: 
 
where TOC (0 h) and TOC (t) are the initial 
TOC value at (0 h) and the TOC value after particular reaction tim e (t), respectively. 
 
Enzyme activities 
Extraction of enzyme s after decoloriza-
tion of dyes by bacterial consortium under sequential microaerophilic/aerobic condi-tions was carried out as per the procedure described earlier (Phugare et al., 2011a). Briefly, the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7500 x g for 15 min in cold 
condition (4 ± 0.2 
oC) and considered as test 
sample for determination of extracellular en-zyme activities. The resulted cell pellets were suspended in 50 mM potassium phos-phate buffer (pH 7.4), homogenized and sonicated by giving 7 strokes of 30 s each for 2 min interval based on 50 amplitude output at  4 ± 0.2 
oC (Sonics-vibracell ultrasonic 
processor). These sonicated cells were fur-ther centrifuged at 7500 x g for 15 min at 4 ± 
0.2 
oC and supernatant was used as the 
source of intracellular enzymes. Similar pro-tocol was followed to quantity the enzyme activities of control broth. The developed consortium without adding dyes was consid-ered as control.  
Activities of both oxidative as well as re-
ductive enzymes such as laccase, veratryl alcohol oxidase, azoreductase and NADH-DCIP reductase were assayed using UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-2800, Japan). 
Laccase activity was determined by measur-
ing the oxidation of 2’-Azino-bis-(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulf onic acid) at 420 nm 
(ƹ
420nm= 36000 (M cm)-1) (Wolfenden and 
Willson, 1982). Veratryl alcohol oxidase ac-tivity was determined by monitoring the formation of veratraldehyde at 310 nm (ƹ
310nm= 9300 (M cm)-1 (Jadhav et al., 
2009). Azoreductase assay was performed in a reaction mixture of 2.0 ml containing the 4.45 µM of Methyl red and 0.2 ml of enzyme solution in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The reaction was started by adding 100 µM of NADH and decrease in color absorbance due to the reductive cleav-age of methyl red was monitored at 430 nm (ƹ
430nm= 23360 (M cm)-1) (Chen et al., 
2005). The NADH–DCIP reductase activity was determined in a reaction mixture of 5.0 ml containing 25 μM DCIP and 0.2 ml of 
enzyme solution in 50 mM potassium phos-phate buffer (pH 7.5). From this, 2.0 ml reac-tion mixture was assayed by adding 250 µM NADH and reduction in DCIP was measured at 590 nm (19 mM
-1 cm-1) (Salokhe and Go-
vindwar, 1999). All experiments were run in triplicate at 30 ± 0.2 
oC, average rates were 
calculated and one unit of enzyme activity was defined as a change in absorbance unit min
-1 mg of protein-1. The protein content 
was determined by using the method of Lowry et al. (1951) with bovine serum al-bumin as standard. 
 
Acute toxicity studies 
The toxicity of azo dyes and its degraded 
metabolites were determined by acute toxici-ty test with Daphnia magna  as described 
previously (Francisco n et al., 2009a, b). 
Briefly, the dyes decolorized broth after treatment with bacterial consortium were centrifuged at 7500 x g for 20 min in cold 
condition, supernatant was collected and sterilized by passi ng through 0.45 µm pore 
size filter. The resulted filtrate was then used to perform sensitivity tests using 6 to 24 h old neonates. Each dye filtrate was then di-luted to 25, 50, 75 and 100 % in an Erlen-100 TOC Initial   TOC Observed  -  TOC Initial (%) ratio removal TOC

164 meyer flask and 5 organisms were added. 
The tests were carried out at 20 ± 0.2 oC for 
48 h in the absence of light and number of immobile organisms wa s counted after ex-
posing to light for 20  seconds. Tests were 
carried out in triplicate for each concentra-tion and control in distilled water.  
 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was carried out using 
the software SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The significance of variance was ana-lyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test.  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Decolorization of textile azo dyes 
The chemical structural differences in 
textile dyes due to the substitution of various functional groups on aromatic base greatly influence their decolorization rates (Chivu-kula and Renganathan, 1995; Pasti-Grigsby et al., 1992). Thus, the bacterial consortium 
consisting of previously isolated dyes de-
grading bacteria P. rettgeri  strain HSL1 and 
Pseudomonas sp.  SUK1 has been developed 
and investigated for de colorization of struc-
turally different azo dyes under microaero-philic and aerobic conditions. The results of the decolorization study indicate that both the individual cultures and its consortium were failed to completely decolorize selected dyes (100 mg L
-1) under aerobic conditions 
and only 12-22 % performance was achieved within 48 h. On the other hand, individual cultures P. rettgeri  s t r a i n  H S L 1  a n d  Pseu-
domonas sp.  SUK1 were able to completely 
decolorize two azo dyes viz. RO 16 (24 and 18 h) and DR 78 (36 an d 42 h) and partially 
decolorize another dyes viz. RB 5 (52 and 58 %) and DR 81 (85 and 92 %) in micro-aerophilic conditions within 48 h respective-ly (Figure 1).

165 All the dyes showed different extent of 
decolorization by both the cultures as the 
variation in chemical st ructural characteristic 
significantly affects the biotransformation process (Senan and Abraham, 2004; Moosvi et al., 2005). Decolorization of RO 16 and DR 78 appears in less time by both the cul-tures as compared to incomplete removal of RB 5 and DR 81 even at the end of 48 h of incubation period suggesting the inability of individual cultures to decolorize two dyes. 
However, bacterial consortium showed com-plete decolorization of all the four azo dyes 
viz. RB 5 in 30 h, RO16  in 12 h, DR 78 in 18 
h and DR 81 in 24 h at same incubation con-ditions. The rate of decolorization by bacte-rial consortium was very high from the very beginning of the experiment and it has com-pletely decolorized all the selected azo dyes. These results suggest that, the average de-colorization rate of the bacterial consortium was significantly higher than that observed for individual bacterial cultures. In consistent 
with these findings, th e higher decolorization 
rate of reactive azo dye Green HE4BD by developed microbial consortium GR of P. 
vulgaris  and M. glutamicus  cultures was re-
ported when compared with its constituent pure strains (Saratale et al., 2010). In addi-
tion, a fungal-bacterial consortium-AP con-sisting of A. ochraceus  NCIM 1146 fungi 
and Pseudomonas sp.  SUK1 bacteria and a 
bacterial consortium SDS consisting of Providencia sp.  SDS and Ps. aeuroginosa 
strain BCH were reported for enhanced de-colorization of azo dyes Rubine GFL and Red HE3B than its i ndividual cultures (Lade 
et al., 2012; Phugare et al., 2011b). The en-
hanced decolorization performance by bacte-rial consortium might be due to the synergis-tic reactions of individu al strains in the con-
sortium (Chen and Chang, 2007). It is known that, in microbial consortium the individual strains may attack the dye molecule at vari-
ous positions or may utilize the degradation metabolites generated by co-existing strains for further degradation which results in en-hanced decolorization of  dyes (Moosvi et al., 
2007; Asgher et al., 2007). Optimization of decolorization conditions 
Decolorization perfor mance of bacteria 
has been known to be greatly influenced by various environmental conditions. For the enhancement of decolo rization rate and to 
design an affordable treatment technology for textile effluent co ntaining structurally 
different azo dyes, the optimization of de-colorization conditions has been carried out. The complete and enhanced decolorization of all azo dyes (100 mg L
-1) was observed 
within 12-30 h by bacterial consortium under microaerophilic conditions while only 12 % RB 5, 20 % RO 16, 22 % DR 78, and 21 % DR 81 dye removal performance was achieved under shaking conditions within the same time (Figure 2a). Hence, the microaer-ophilic conditions were adopted to optimize pH, temperature and dye concentration for enhanced degradation studies. 
The result of the azo dyes decolorization 
by bacterial consortium at 100 mg L
-1 con-
centration suggested that, 30 ± 0.2 oC was 
the best temperature for enhanced decolori-zation of all dyes in microaerophilic condi-
tions (Figure 2b). Further increase or de-crease in the temperature resulted in reduc-tion of decolorization performance. Moosvi et al. (2007) reported that a bacterial consor-tium JW-2 consisted of Paenibacillus poly-
myxa , Micrococcus luteus  and Micrococcus 
sp. exhibited good decolo rization ability of 
Reactive Violet 5R in the temperature range from 25 to 37 
oC. The pH study showed that, 
bacterial consortium was able to decolorize all dyes at broad range  of initial broth pH, 
however the optimum pH was found to be 7.0 for pre-enriched broth. Decrease in de-colorization performance was observed at lower pH (3-6) and higher pH (8-12) (Fig-ure 2c). Phugare et al. (2011b)  found that pH 
7.0 was optimum for enhanced decoloriza-tion of azo dye Red HE3B by a bacterial consortium consisting of Providencia sp.  
SDS and Ps. aeuroginosa  strain BCH. The 
pH is directly associated with the overall bi-ochemical processes and eventually to the growth of microorganisms. It is also sug-gested that, pH is more likely related to the EXCLI Journal 2015;14:158-174 – ISSN 1611-2156

166 transport of dye molecules across the cell 
membrane, which was considered as the rate 
limiting factor in deco lorization performance 
(Lourenco et al., 2000). To assess the maxi-mum decolorization ability of consortium, it was tested against different concentrations of azo dyes (50 to 250 mg L
-1). The complete 
decolorization of all the dyes was observed up to the concentration of 100 mg L
-1 within 
30 h at 30 ± 0.2 oC temperature and further 
increase in dye concentration resulted in re-duction of decolorization efficiencies (Figure 2d). Lower decolorization rate by bacterial consortium at higher dyes concentration was reported (Phugare et al., 2011b). The de-crease in decolorization efficiency at higher dye concentration may be due to the toxic effect of dye molecules on bacteria and/or less bacterial biomass for the uptake of high-er dye concentration (Saratale et al., 2009). Hence, 100 mg L
-1 of all dyes concentrations 
were selected for further degradation and detoxification studies at microaerophilic, aerobic and sequential in cubation processes.  Decolorization at various processes 
The results of the decolorization study 
showed that, 98-99 % decolorization of all the four dyes was observed within 30 h of incubation under microaerophilic conditions (Table 2). However, variation in decoloriza-tion time was observed for all the dyes viz. RB 5 (30 h), RO 16 (12 h), DR 78 (18 h) and DR 81 (24 h) and that may be due to the structural differences of azo dyes used (Moosvi et al., 2005). It  has been reported 
that the azo dyes with mono azo bond were more likely to be decolorized faster than those with diazo or tr iazo groups (Franciscon 
et al., 2009a). For this reason, RO 16 and DR 
78, which are both monoazo dyes showed a short decolorization time (12 and 18 h, re-spectively) and the highly substituted diazo RB 5 and DR 81 showed longer decoloriza-tion times (30 and 24 h, respectively). It is suggested that, the azo dyes with a hydroxyl or amino groups were more likely to be de-colorized faster than those with methyl,

167 methoxy, sulfo or nitro groups (Nigam et al., 
1996). Hence, in the present study variation 
in decolorization time was observed for all the dyes as these have difference in number of azo bonds and its position. The complete decolorization of all the dyes at microaero-philic conditions suggest that this process favors the decolorization and which may be due to the involvement of reductive enzymes in initial break-down of azo dyes. It was re-ported that, reductive cleavage of azo bonds 
(–N=N–) by azoreductase normally occurs in absence or reduced levels of oxygen as in microaerophilic conditions (Chang et al., 2001; Sheth and Dave, 2009) . In contrast to 
the complete decolorization of all the four dyes under microaerophilic condition, the reduced performance only up to 12 % for RB 5, 20 % for RO 16, 22 % for DR 78 and 21 % for DR 81 was achieved under aerobic conditions within the same time and even no complete decolorization was observed in 48 h (Table 2). A previous study on aerobic de-colorization of azo dyes has also shown that this process is insufficient to completely de-
grade most of azo dyes (Ogugbue et al., 
2012).  
Results of the sequential aerobic/micro-
aerophilic and microaer ophilic/aerobic pro-
cess demonstrated that, bacterial consortium was able to completely decolorize all the four azo dyes within 30 h viz. RB 5 (98 % in 30 h), RO 16 (99 % in 12 h), DR 78 (98 % in 18h) and DR 81 (99 % in 24 h) (Table 2). These observations are in agreement with previous reports where potential of sequen-tial aerobic/microaerophilic and microaero-philic/aerobic processes in the enhanced de-colorization of azo dyes have been reported (Franciscon et al., 2009 a; Waghmode et al., 
2011, 2012). It has been suggested that, se-quential processes carri ed out the reductive 
and/or oxidative break-down of azo dyes which results in its complete decolorization (Waghmode et al., 2012). The role of azoreductase enzymes in decolorization of azo dyes under microaerophilic conditions has been previously reported (Saratale et al.,

168 2010). Alternatively, aerobic degradation of 
textile azo dyes by bacterial consortium has 
been also reported (Senan and Abraham, 2004; Tony et al., 2009). However, the aero-bic decolorization of azo dyes depends on the oxidation potential of microorganisms. 
Mixed bacterial culture SKB-II consisted of five bacterial strains as Bacillus vallismortis , 
Bacillus pumilus , Bacillus cereus , Bacillus 
subtilis  and Bacillus megaterium  exhibited 
good potential (43-71 %) in aerobic decolor-ization of azo dyes viz. Congo red, Bor-deaux, Ranocid Fast and Blue BCC (Tony et al., 2009). The involvement of H
2O2 inde-
pendent oxidase especially laccase in aerobic decolorization of azo dyes has been previ-
ously reported (Senan  and Abraham, 2004; 
Chivukala and Renganathan, 1995). In con-text with these reports, the present bacterial consortium showed complete decolorization of all the azo dyes by both sequential pro-cesses as an initial re duction of azo bond in 
microaerophilic condition and/or oxidation under aerobic condition.  
 
Formation of aromatic amines and TOC 
reduction 
The general approach of biodegradation 
is to mineralize the textile dyes using natural capability of native microorganisms. But, most of the textile azo dyes are xenobiotics and its biodegradation re sults into formation 
of aromatic amines, which are more toxic than parent dyes and even carcinogenic and/ or mutagenic (Levine, 1991). Formation of aromatic amines by bacterial degradation of azo dyes under microaerophilic conditions has been reported (Franciscon et al., 2009a). Aerobic treatments for biodegradation of azo dyes have also been reported; however, such oxidative break-down of azo bond is not suf-ficient to completely mineralize them into nontoxic form (Ogugbue et al., 2012). Hence, in the present study the safe biode-gradation processes for complete mineraliza-tion of azo dyes without formation of aro-matic amines have been evaluated. The broth obtained after decolorization under micro-aerophilic, aerobic and both sequential pro-cesses by using bacterial consortium was an-
alyzed for presence of aromatic amines and 
TOC reduction.  
Spectrophotometric analysis data reveals 
the presence of aromatic amines in all the four azo dyes decolorized broths under mi-croaerophilic conditions viz. RB 5 (0.26 mM), RO 16 (0.18 mM), DR 78 (0.20 mM) and DR 81 (0.23 mM) (Table 2). The formation of colorless aromatic amines in microaerophilic conditions can be a result of 
reductive cleavage of azo bond (–N=N–) (Chung et al., 1992). This occurs due to the activity of azoreductase when carriers in the electron transport chai n utilize azo dyes as 
terminal electron acceptors in absence of ox-ygen and results in the formation of aromatic amines (Singh et al., 2007; Van der Zee and 
Villaverde, 2005). In contrary, the aerobic process doesn’t show formation of aromatic amines, but very less (12 to 22 %) decolori-zation was observed within the same time. This suggests the inability of bacterial con-sortium for aerobic degradation of selected azo dyes.  
Results of the sequential aerobic/micro-
aerophilic processes also showed formation of aromatic amines even after complete de-colorization of all the azo dyes viz. RB 5 (0.08 mM), RO 16 (0.06 mM), DR 78 (0.07 mM) and DR 81 (0.09 mM). This is because of the initial oxidation of azo dyes which might be repressed by the absence of oxygen in further micr oaerophilic stage. 
Thus, aromatic amines resulting from the decolorization process under microaerophilic stage are not mineralized further by subse-quent aerobic stage and thus tend to accumu-
late in the decolorized broth (Gottlieb et al., 2003; Luangdilok and Panswad, 2000). In contrast, sequential microaerophilic/aerobic processes completely decolorized all the dyes and did not show the presence of aro-matic amines in dyes decolorized broth. These results indicate that the aromatic amines produced under microaerophilic con-ditions were ultimately removed in the aero-bic stage suggesting its potential as safe pro-cess for biodegradation of azo dyes.

169 been known that reductive enzymes such as 
azoreductase carried out the initial break-
down of azo bonds in microaerophilic condi-tion while oxidative enzymes such as laccase further performs the oxidative cleavage of formed amines in aerobic condition (Zim-merman et al., 1982; Duran and Esposito, 2000). These findings are in agreement with previous studies where sequential microaer-ophilic/aerobic processe s capable of remov-
ing azo dyes via biotransformation and/ or biodegradation without forming aromatic amines have been reported (Franciscon et al., 2009a). In another repo rt, a sequential anaer-
obic/aerobic system was used to treat a simu-lated textile wastewater containing azo dyes in which significant amount of aromatic amines was removed successfully in sequen-tial aerobic stage (I sik and Sponza, 2008). 
The degradation of azo dyes by bacterial 
consortium was confir med by TOC analysis. 
Result of the decolorization study under mi-croaerophilic conditions showed 63, 68, 72, and 81 % reduction in TOC level for RB 5, RO 16, DR 78, and DR 81 respectively sug-
gesting their mineralization (Table 2). Also, the bacterial consortiu m showed enhanced 
TOC reduction under seque ntial aerobic/mi-
croaerophilic processes viz. RB 5 (63 %), RO 16 (69 %), DR 78 (72 %) and DR 81 (65 %); and sequential microaerophilic/ aer-obic process as well viz. RB 5 (62 %), RO 16 (68 %), DR 78 (72 %) and DR 81 (64 %). In contrast, under aerobic conditions the re-moval ratio for TOC was very less viz. RB 5 (10 %), RO 16 (20 %), DR 78 (20 %) and DR 81 (18 %). The significant reduction in TOC from dyes decolorized broth under mi-croaerophilic as well as  sequential processes 
supported the mineralization of azo dyes. Thus, the present bacterial consortium was found to be promising for biodegradation of azo dyes under microaerophilic and sequen-tial processes. However, complete absence of aromatic amines with optimum reduction in TOC content was observed only under se-quential microaerophilic/aerobic processes suggesting its potential in biodegradation and detoxification of textile azo dye contam-
inated sites. 
 
Enzyme analysis 
Microbial consortium capable of decolor-
izing textile dyes via biotransformation and/ or biodegradation have been reported and the 
efficiency of degradation and detoxification are known to be depend ent on the activities 
of enzymes produced by microorganisms in the consortiums (Pasti-Grigsby et al., 1992; Senan and Abraham, 2004). Thus, to under-stand the mechanism of azo dyes degradation by bacterial consortium which doesn’t pro-duce aromatic amines under sequential mi-croaerophilic/aerobic pro cesses; the activities 
of oxidative (laccase a nd veratryl alcohol 
oxidase) and reductive (azoreductase and NADH-DCIP reductase) enzymes were mon-itored in dyes decolorized broth.   
Enzymatic activity analysis of bacterial 
consortium reveals the involvement of four studied enzymes viz. laccase, veratryl alco-hol oxidase, azoreducta se and NADH-DCIP 
reductase in biotransformation of selected azo dyes. Significant induction in the activi-ties of reductive enzymes viz. azo reductase and NADH DCIP reductase by 97 and 229 % for RB 5, 55 and 160 % for RO 16, 63 and 196 % for DR 78, and 108 and 258 % for DR 81 respectively as compared to control (bac-terial consortium without addition of dye) (Table 3). Higher induc tion in reductive en-
zymes after decolorizati on of all the four azo 
dyes supports the active role of bacterial 
consortium in the sequential biodegradation process. It is suggested that, the reductive cleavage of azo bond is the initial step in bacterial metabolism of azo dyes under mi-croaerophilic conditions (Franciscon et al., 2009a). In agreement with these findings, our results also showed significant induction of azo reductase activities, suggesting the reduction of azo bonds. However, the single microaerophilic incubation condition reveals the presence of aromatic amines in all the dyes decolorized broth supporting that the reduction is the initial step in bacterial degra-dation of azo dyes (Table 2).

cus glutamicus  NCIM-2168 during decolori-
zation of textile azo dye Scarlet R was re-ported (Saratale et al., 2009). 
In contrary to induced reductases, the 
slight increase in oxidative enzyme activities of laccase and veratryl alcohol oxidase as 28 
and 45 % for RB 5, 14 and 20 % for RO 16, 19 and 26 % for DR 78, and 36 and 51 % for DR 81 were respectively detected (Table 3). The less induction in oxidative enzyme ac-tivities might be due to the subsequent de-gradation of formed amines which were in 
fewer quantities than parent dyes. In the 
same contest, slight increase in activities of oxidative enzymes laccase and veratryl alco-hol oxidase were previously reported in a fungal-bacterial consortium degrading textile azo dye Rubine GFL (Lade et al., 2012). Therefore, in the present study, complete degradation of all azo  dyes without forming 
aromatic amines was observed only under sequential microaerophili c/aerobic processes. 
The significant induction in reductase en-zyme activities support the initial reduction of azo dyes under microaerophilic step and 
slight increase in oxidative enzyme activities suggest the further oxidation of formed amines under subsequent aerobic step.  
 
Acute toxicity studies 
It is of great concer n to study the toxicity 
of azo dyes before and after degradation by microorganisms as such dyes as well as their degradation metabolites are known to be tox-ic for human health and aquatic biota (Che-quer et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2010). The acute tests with Daphnia magna  have been known 
as a first screening method for the evaluation of lethal toxicity of new chemicals to mam-
mals and humans (Guilhermino et al., 2000). 
Thus, the relative sensitivities of four azo dyes used and its degradation products after treatment with bacterial consortium were as-sessed by acute toxicity test with Daphnia 
magna . The test was carried out in 75 % of 
original azo dyes containing broth as 100 % mortality has been obser ved in the original 
as well as 25 and 50 % diluted broths. This is in agreement with a previous report, where complete mortality of Daphnia magna  was EXCLI Journal 2015;14:158-174 – ISSN 1611-2156 
Received: October 22, 2014, accepted: Decem ber 02, 2014, published: January 29, 2015 
 
 
171 found in original and 1:2 diluted azo dyes 
decolorized broths (Franciscon et al., 2009a). 
The results of the toxicity assay are pre-
sented as percent death of Daphnia magna  
occurred in the bacter ial consortium treated 
azo dyes broth under di fferent incubation 
processes. The toxicity data showed that degradation under microaerophilic and se-quential aerobic/micr oaerophilic conditions 
were not sufficient to remove the complete toxicity of dyes as little (1 to 4 %) mortality of Daphnia magna  was observed in these 
treatment samples (Table 4). In addition, the partially decolorized azo dyes samples under aerobic conditions showed near about same mortality as like cont rol dyes viz. 39 % RB5, 
35 % RO16, 37 % DR78 and 41 % DR 81. In contrast, the sequential microaerophilic/ aerobic process treated dyes sample doesn’t show any mortality suggesting the complete removal of toxicity from decolorized broths. Therefore, a last sequential aerobic stage is necessary to diminish the toxicity from dyes decolorized broths. It can be concluded that, 
even bacterial consortium was able to com-pletely decolorize a ll the dyes under micro-
aerophilic, sequential aerobic/microaerophi-lic and sequential microaerophilic/aerobic processes, the final aerobic stage is necessary for aromatic amines removal (Sponza and Isik, 2005).  
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS 
All four tested textile azo dyes were 
completely decolorized by the bacterial con-sortium under microaerophilic, sequential aerobic/microaerophilic and microaerophilic/ aerobic processes with some differences in 
decolorization times depending on the dyes structures. The sequential microaerophilic/ aerobic process was found to be very effec-tive in azo dyes decolorization as no aro-matic amines detected in dye-decolorized broths. Additionally, significant reduction in the TOC content from all the dye-decolorized broths under this process sug-gested its efficacy for mineralization of dyes. 
The significant induction in the activities of 
azo reductase and NADH-DCIP reductase suggested the initial reduction of azo bonds 
under microaerophilic stag e while slight in-
crease in laccase and veratryl alcohol oxi-dase activities confirmed further oxidation of formed amines by subsequent aerobic stage. Acute toxicity test with Daphnia magna  re-
vealed complete detoxification of azo dye-degraded metabolites under sequential mi-
croaerophilic/aerobic processes. Thus, the sequential microaerophilic/aerobic process provides good evidence of the applicability of developed bacterial consortium as a prom-ising and safe method in biodegradation and 
detoxification of azo dyes.
