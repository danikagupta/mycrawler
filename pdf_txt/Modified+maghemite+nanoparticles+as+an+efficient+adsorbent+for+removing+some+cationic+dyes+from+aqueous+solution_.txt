ABSTRACT  
Magnetic nanoparticles can be utilized for various purposes of public benefit owing to their specific properties. 
In last few decades magneti c Iron oxide nanomaterials have been developed extensively not only for researchers 
interest but also for many potential applications such as biosensing, drug delivery, magnetic resonance 
imaging, hyperthermia, catalysis, environmental remediation etc. Thi s work outlines the developments in the 
field of  prospective  application of Iron oxide nanoparticles.  
Keywords :- Application, Ironoxide, Magnetic,  Nanomaterials   
 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
Due to nanosize, high surface area to volume ratio and superparamagnetic pro perty [1-3] researchers are 
focusing on synthesis and application of Iron oxide nanomaterials in recent years. It is reported that particle 
sizes, morphology, surface structure, magnetic behavior of nanomaterials is influenced significantly by synthesis 
methods and surface coatings [4]. Many researchers have been focusing their efforts on developing chemical 
and physical methods for the synthesis of M agnetic nanoparticles  (MNPs)  [5]. In recent times, various synthesis 
techniques have been explored to synthe size superior nanoparticles [6], nano -ovals [7], nanobelts [8] or any 
other nano -sized structures.  Ironoxide nanoparticles ( IONPs ) are very unique in their usefulness owing to their 
simple synthesis, surface functionalization, and the capability to manage or control the matter on atomic level 
[9,10]. Since iron oxide nanomaterials are less toxic, chemically inert and biocompatible, they confirm a 
remarkable usefulness in association with biotechnology [11]. Applications of these nonmaterials in various 
fields depend  on their shape, size and surface morphology.  
 
II.  NANOTECHNOLOGY  
Nanotechnology deals with the study and control of matter at dimensions of approximately 1 -100 nm [12]. 
Nanomaterials are the substances having size less than 100 nm in at least on e dimension. Nanotechnology is an 
interdisciplinary science to a large extent  and combines the laws of Physics, chemical processes and biological 
principles at the nano scale level.  
The possibility of synthesis of nanosized products for the first time was connected with the well -known lecture 
called ―There is a lot of space down there‖ of Mr. R. Feyman, delivered in 1959 at the conference of the 
American Physical Society. The term ―Nanotechnology‖ was introduced for the first time by N. Taniguchi at the  
295 | P a g e  
 international forum on industrial production in Tokyo in 1974. In the second half of 1980s to the early 1990s 
many important discoveries were made which influenced the development of Nanotechnology.  
Even long before the start of ―Nonoera‖, people were using various nanosized objects. They consider that small 
particles of various substances exhibit properties different to the larger particles of same substances. But the 
accurate reason of this concept was not clear to them. In this way, people were dealing wit h Nanotechnology 
subconsciously without understanding that they are working with the nanoworld phenomenon [13]. 
Nanoparticles  differ from large -sized materials as the number of atoms at the exterior surface is very high and 
have unique physical properties differing from corresponding bulk materials [14]. The physical properties of 
bulk materials e.g. resistivity, density, magnetization and dielectric constant are averaged properties. Many 
properties of bulk materials change as size is reduced up to nanoleve l [15].  
 
III.  IRON OXIDE NANOMATERIALS  
3.1. Crystal structure of Iron oxides  
There are some inorganic compounds made of iron and oxygen, they are known as Iron oxides . Iron forms 
overall sixteen oxides and oxyhydroxides [16] which find wide range of appl ication from pigments in ceramic 
materials to use in thermite.  
In the crystal structure of hematite, arrangement of O2- ions is H exagonal Close Packed  in which Fe3+ ions 
occupy the octahedral sites (Fig. 1a). In magnetite and maghemite, arrangement of O2- ions is C ubic Close 
Packed  (Fig. 1b). In magnetite Fe3+ and Fe2+ both ions are present, Fe3+ ions are distributed at random among 
octahedral and tetrahedral sites, and  Fe2+ ions occupy octahedral sites. It has an inverse spinel structure. [17]. 
Maghemite also displays a similar spinel structure except the presence of vacant sites in the cation pattern. Fe3+ 
ions are arranged on two -thirds of the lattice sites in a regular fashion exhibiting two occupied sites followed by 
one vacant site [16]. 
  
                               
  
Figure 1: structure of (a) hematite and (b) magnetite crystals  [18]. 
3.2. Ferrofluids  
A steady colloidal homogeneous suspension of magnetic nanoparticles (around 10nm in size) in a suitable liquid 
either aqueous or non -aqueous termed as Ferrofluid or magnetic fluid [19]. Iron oxide nanoparticles which have  
296 | P a g e  
 more saturation magnetization values and high magnetic susceptibility are preferentially utilized as magnetic 
particles for this purpose. Usually magnetite and maghemite have been us ed for this purpose [16,20]. The 
magnetite nanoparticles  are ideal for use owing to their higher saturation magnetization values [21]. 
 
IV.  APPLICATIONS OF IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES  
4.1 Drug Delivery                                                                                                                    
Drug targeting using IONPs has evolved as one of the novel tools for delivery of drugs in recent years. The 
nanoparticles can be delivered to the target area and fixed at a location where the medic ine is discharged by 
applying MNPs along with an external magnetic field. This technology is termed as magnetic drug targeting 
[22,23 ]. This method of drug transport to a particular location can stop the side effects and also decrease the 
quantity of medic ation required. The surfaces of the nanoparticles  being utilized for drug delivery are commonly 
capped with drugs, proteins, and genetic materials to attain their targeted release [24,25].  
 
4.2 Bioseparation  
In biomedical research, specific biological uni ts e.g., DNAs, proteins can be separated from their neighboring 
atmosphere using superparamagnetic (SPMs) colloids because nature of magnetization of SPMs in presence and 
absence of external magnetic field differs from each other. In this process, the biol ogical units labeled with 
super paramagnetic colloids are separated by applying a magnetic field [4]. Due to their small size and high 
surface area, MNPs exhibit many superior characteristics compared with the conventional micrometer -sized 
resins or beads which are suitable for bioseparation purposes, such as good dispersability, fast and effective 
binding of biomolecules, and reversible and controllable flocculation. Hsiao et al . [26] designed C18 -
functionalized Fe 3O4 nanoparticles not only to specifically  trap phosphopeptides, but also nonphosphorylated 
peptides, both of which can be subsequently desorbed selectively by stepwise elution with different eluents.  
 
4.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Due to face -centered cubic arrangement of oxygen in maghemite and  magnetite, electrons are allowed to shift 
between iron ions occupying the lattice tetrahedral and octahedral sites. It gives half -metallic properties to these 
molecules which are appropriate for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [27]. 
Recently, Muller et a l. [28] has broadly explained  applications of superparamagnetic IO NPs as a contrast agent. 
Kim et al. [29] synthesized ferrofluids coated with oleic acid surfactant and dispersed in a suitable carrier for 
bio-applications such as chitosan and found that it  was useful for MRI contrast agents.  
 
4.4 Hyperthermia  
In cancer treatment magnetic nanoparticles can be used very effectively for hyperthermia treatment. Tumor cells 
are heated at temperature 41 -45˚C by using superparamagnetic nanoparticles under an alternating magnetic 
field. At this stage tissue damage for normal tissue is reversible although the tumor cells are permanently 
damaged [30]. Some researchers have shown that magnetite cationic liposomal nanoparticles [31,32 ] and 
dextran -coated magnetite [33] effectively increase the temperature of tumor cells for  hyperthermia.  
  
297 | P a g e  
 4.5 Catalysis Applications  
There are a range of reactions involving transition metal catalysis which make use of catalytic sites implanted 
onto MNPs for example carbon -carbon cross -coupling reactions [34,35], hydroformylation [36], hydroge nation 
[37] and polymerization [38] reactions. Magnetite and hematite have been employed as catalysts in various 
types of industrially important reactions [39-42], for example synthesis of NH 3 (the Haber process), the high 
temperature water gas shift react ion, and the desulfurization of natural gas. Owing to their specific 
semiconductor  nature magnetite and hematite can catalyze oxidation/reduction reactions [41,43,44]. Hematite 
has also been used as a support material for gold as catalysts for the oxidatio n of carbon monoxide at low 
temperature [44,45]. Magnetite/carbon composites have been found useful for reducing the amount of 
undesirable N 2 in fuel oil [44]. 
 
4.6 Environmental remediation  
The technology based on Iron nanoparticle is supposed as the pote nt member of the first generation of nanoscale 
environmental technologies [47,48]. A few of the most demanding environment cleaning tasks can be provided 
cost-effective solutions by this technology [49]. Recently, Lee et al. [50] have synthesized 4,4-Diflu oro-4-bora-
3a,4a -diaza -s-indacene ( BODIPY )-functionalized magnetic silica nanoparticles to make water and human blood 
free from Pb2+ with high affinity and selectivity. Their reported observations may help to develop a novel type 
of biocompatible scheme fo r the detection, recovery, and elimination of various heavy toxic metals from the 
human body by stabilizing the appropriate fluorescence receptors onto the surface of novel magnetic 
nanomaterials. It also showed that magnetic nanoparticles exhibit a great capability and effectiveness during the 
elimination of a variety of metal ions due to their high surface area as compared to micron -sized adsorbents.  
Nassar (2010) [51] studied the removal of Pb2+ ions and reported that the highest adsorption capacity for Pb2+ 
ions was 36.0 mg./g. by Fe 3O4 nanoparticles. It was much higher than the results reported with low cost 
adsorbents. Peng et al. developed a novel magnetic adsorbent by immobilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae on the 
outer surface of chitosan coated magne tic nanoparticles and employed for the removal of Cu2+ ions from 
aqueous solution [52]. Li et al. [53] analyzed the functions of nanocatalyst Superfine Fe 2O3 nanoparticles during 
the removal of carbon monoxide. It can act both as a catalyst and as an oxida nt. They observed that the 
effectiveness of nanoparticles as CO catalyst is much more than the micro -sized oxide powder and Fe 2O3 
nanoparticle can oxidize CO as an oxidant even in the absence of oxygen.  
Iron oxide nanomaterials absorb visible light so can be utilized as a good photocatalyst [54]. The most 
commonly applied photocatalyst is TiO 2 which usually absorbs the Ultraviolet radiation having wavelength less 
than 380 nm owing to its large energy -gap of 3.2 eV [55]. Fe2O3 is an appropraiate compound for  
photodegradation under visible light condition due to its low band -gap of 2.2 eV. Many Iron Oxides having 
Fe(III) oxides e.g. α -Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, α-FeOOH, β -FeOOH and γ -FeOOH have better photocatalytic effect and 
reduce toxicity by degrading organic polluta nts [56]. Additionly, Fe 2O3 can also be functional for sensitizing 
TiO 2 photocatalyst due to its small band -gap, [55,57]. 
Magnetism is a specific physic al characteristic that influences  the physical properties of adsorbents in water and 
supports independen tly water purification technologies. Therefore, many researchers have extensively utilized 
magnetic separation in combination with adsorption procedure to decontaminate water and cleaning the  
298 | P a g e  
 environment  [58,59]. IONPs are capable for wastewater treatment at industrial level due to their low cost, strong 
adsorption capacity, easy separation and enhanced stability [60,61]. The capacity of iron oxide nanomaterials  to 
eliminate contaminants has been studied at both laboratory and field levels [62,63]. The cont aminant loaded 
magnetic nanoadsorbents can be separated easily from solution using an external magnetic field.   
 
V.  CONCLUSION  
The use of ironoxide nanoparticles in various fields  has been a beneficial  development. Due to eas e of synthesis, 
magnetic natur e and biocompatibility, th ey turned out to be  a useful tool for scientists. However, there are so 
many challenges  which researchers are facing  to provide efficient iron oxide nanoparticles for specific purposes. 
Therefore, future researches and studies sho uld target to work on and solve these challenges.
