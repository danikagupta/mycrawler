Abstract 
Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is an analytical technique for measuring biomolecular interactions. It is 
based on the physical phenomenon that particles move within temperature gradients, which is affe cted by 
their size, charge, hydration shell and conformation. The MST sample must contain a fluorescent target 
molecule  used to observe the movement of particles, and this can be titrated with an unlabelled binding 
partner for quantifying the interaction . MST is highly sensitive, using relatively small amounts of sample, 
and it has no limitations on the size of the target biomolecule , on the affinity of the interacti on or on the 
composition of the buffer and other sample components. This makes MST ideally s uited to characterising 
interactions with membrane proteins, which can be studied in cell lysates, native membranes , solubilised  in 
detergents or reconstituted in lipids. The intrinsic aromatic residues of membrane proteins have been used 
as the fluorophor e for MST (label -free MST) or membrane proteins have been labelled with a range of 
fluorescent dyes or conjugated with fluorescent proteins (labelled MST). The different types of membrane 
proteins that have had biomolecular interactions characte rised by MST include the SARS -CoV-2 spike 
protein, GPCRs and other receptors, sensor kinases, ion channels, aquaporins, and transport proteins.

1. Introduction  
Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a biophysical technique for measuring biomolecular interactions. It is 
based on the physical phenomenon that particles move within temperature gradients, usually from regions 
of higher to lower temperature. The movement of particles is affected by their size, charge, hydration shell 
and conformation, any of which can ch ange during biomolecular interactions  [1-10]. In MST a microscopic 
temperature gradient is induced by infrared laser light and the sample must contain a fluorescent target 
molecule that is used to observe the movement of particles. The fluorescent molecule  is kept at a constant 
concentration and is titrated with a range of concentrations of an unlabelled binding partner. The movement 
of fluorescent molecules within the temperature gradient results in a quantifiable change in their local 
concentration and th erefore of the measured fluorescence, thus enabling estimation of binding affinities. The 
necessary fluorescence property may be intrinsic to one of the binding partners (e.g., from aromatic residues 
in a protein) (label -free MST) or a fluorescent dye or o ther fluorescent protein (e.g., green fluorescent protein, 
GFP) must be attached to one of the binding partners (labelled MST). MST can measure many types of  
2 
OSF Preprint 2024 DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/pe7ut  biomolecular interactions, including protein -protein, protein -nucleic acid, protein -lipid, protein -small 
molecule/peptide/ion or protein -liposome/vesicle interactions. It can also measure conformation changes in 
a biomolecule that is subjected to varying conditions. In addition to binding affinities, MST can be used to 
assess other physical parameters of biomolecules and their interactions such as aggregation and 
precipitation, stoichiometry and oligomerisation.  
2. The MST experiment  
In the MST instrument (Figure 1A), samples are  measured in fine glass capillaries with a typical total volume 
of 4 µl. Th e capillary contains a solution of a fluorescent target molecule and a binding partner. The 
fluorescent molecule is excited using an appropriate wavelength of light and the emitted fluorescence is 
detected, both through the same objective lens. An infrared laser is focussed into the capillary to create a 
microscopic temperat ure gradient at the exact spot where fluorescence emission is detected. This gradient is 
focused on a diameter of around 50 µm and typically contains a temperature difference of 2 -6 °C.  
The MST experiment  (Figure 1B) begins with the IR laser switched  off, where molecules are 
homogenously distributed and diffuse freely within the sample. At this point the initial fluorescence intensity 
is detected. When the IR laser is switched on there is immediate heating of the focussed area resulting in a 
rapid change in  fluorophore properties and a strong decrease in fluorescence intensity before thermophoresis 
begins. This is followed by thermophoretic movement of the fluorescent molecules out of the heated area 
resulting in a slow decrease in fluorescence intensity. A steady state is typically reached after around 30 
seconds. The IR laser is then turned off resulting in an immediate increase in fluorescence intensity. As the 
sample cools down there is movement of fluorescent molecules back into the area that was heated to give 
further increase is fluorescence intensity. For each sample, the normalised fluorescence ( Fnorm) is calculated 
from the initial fluorescence ( F0) and from the fluorescence after thermophoresis ( F1), as follows: Fnorm = F1/F0. 
The change in the norm alised fluorescence against the change in concentration of binding partner can be 
used to quantify the affinity of the binding interaction.  
3. Advantages of MST  
MST is a relatively simple, robust, and rapid technique that has several advantages over other biophysical 
techniques commonly used to measure biomolecular interactions such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), 
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrosc opy, and mass spectrometry (MS)  [6, 9, 11-20]. MST has no limitations 
on the size of the target biomolecule or on the affinity of the interaction to be measured (pM to mM) or on 
the composition of the buffer and other sample components. The sample may cont ain detergents or lipids 
and MST measurements can be performed on complex samples such as cell lysates or membrane 
preparations. Unlike in SPR, the target biomolecule does not need to be immobilised. MST is highly sensitive, 
so a principal advantage is tha t experiments use relatively small amounts of sample. For example, a full 
titration using sixteen capillaries each containing 4 µl and performed in triplicate would use a total volume 
of 192 µl. This would contain a total of 1.92 -19.20 picomoles of fluores cent biomolecule if at a concentration 
of 10-100 nM. It follows that assay optimisation also has low sample consumption. MST measurements in the 
instrument are relatively quick, taking around 40 seconds per sample/titration point, so a full titration with 
a series of 16 dilutions can be run in under 15 minutes. These advantages mean that MST is particularly well 
suited to studying membrane proteins that are often large and must be kept in a membrane, lipid or detergent 
environment to retain their native str ucture and activity , and some, especially eukaryotic proteins, can only 
be obtained in small quantities.  
4. MST analysis of membrane proteins  
When manipulating a membrane protein with a fluorophore for MST measurements, any potential effects of 
the fluorop hore on the native structure and activity of the protein should be considered and tested for. This 
should include the use of appropriate controls in the MST measurements and may require the use of other 
biophysical and biochemical analyses to test structur al integrity and activity. Such effects can be avoided if 
native aromatic residues in a target membrane protein can be used as the fluorophore for MST measurements, 
but only four of the studies on membrane proteins ( 4/60) employed this approach (Table S1).  On the face of 
it use of native aromatic residues is more straightforward than reacting the target membrane protein with a 
fluorescent dye or conjugating it with a fluorescent protein, but the intensity of intrinsic fluorescence 
produced in most membrane proteins studied was presumably not high enough for efficient detection.

Figure 1. The MST experiment. In the MST instrument ( A) a series of sixteen glass capillaries (volume 4 µl) are filled with 
samples containing a constant concentration of a fluorescent target biomolecule and a range of concentrations of a 
binding partner (e.g. a ligand). The samples are scanned in turn by being subjected to heating at a microscopic area (50 
µm diameter) using an IR laser, which creates a temperature gradien t. Fluorescence is measured at the same area to 
follow movement of the target biomolecules. In the profile of the MST experiment ( B) the initial fluorescence is measured 
then the IR laser is turned on (5 seconds). This induces an immediate temperature jump  and then movement of the target 
biomolecule away from the heated area (thermophoresis) takes place until a steady state is reached (~30 seconds). The IR 
laser is turned off (35 seconds) then there is back diffusion of the target biomolecule. The magnitude  of the 
thermophoresis, and therefore the normalised fluorescence intensity, are altered by different concentrations of the ligand.

OSF Preprint 2024 DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/pe7ut  One strategy that avoids manipulating the target membrane protein with a fluorophore is to 
reconstitute it in nanodiscs that  have themselves been reacted with a fluorescent dye. For example, MST 
measurements were performed on the human neurotensin receptor NTS1 reconstituted in nanodiscs formed 
using fluorescently labelled membrane scaffold protein MSP1D1. MST measured binding of the G-protein 
subunit G αi1 to NTS1 in Alexa FluorTM 647-labelled MSP1D1 nanodiscs formed using different lipids and in 
the presence of different NTS1 ligands. The affinity of G αi1 binding to NTS1 was influenced by the lipid 
composition of the nanodiscs,  where the highest affinities were obtained using porcine brain polar lipid (BPL) 
in the absence of ligand (K D = 300 ± 100 nM) and in the presence of agonist neurotensin (K D = 140 ± 60 nM). 
Empty nanodiscs (no NTS1) did have a similar binding affinity in t he presence of neurotensin (K D = 200 ± 100 
nM). For comparison, affinities in the presence of antagonists SR48692 or SR142948A were 600 ± 300 nM and 
300 ± 100 nM, respectively, and in the presence of a non -hydrolysable analogue of GTP (GTP γS) (negative 
control) the affinity was 1.5 ± 0.8 µM [21]. 
5. Fluorophores used in MST measurements on membrane proteins  
Out of the 60 different studies that have used MST to analyse membrane proteins (Table S1) over a half 
(52.5%) have employed commercial kits designed to be used with Monolith MST instruments. The majority 
of these kits were red (17/ 60) or blue (4/ 60) dyes containing a succinimidyl ester group that reacts with the 
primary amines on lysine residues to form a covalent bond. Some the of kits (8/ 60) were red dyes that react 
with His -tags engineered on to the target biomolecule, which can be used with either purified proteins  or 
crude samples (e.g. cell lysates). A few of the kits (2/ 60) were green dyes containing a maleimide reactive 
fluorophore that reacts with cysteine residues to form a covalent bond. All of these kits are generally 
optimised for proteins with a molecular weight of more than 5 kDa and concentrations of 2 -20 µM. The next 
most common type of fluorophore used with membrane proteins were three Alexa FluorTM dyes (488, 546, 
647) (7/60) (Figure 2) .

OSF Preprint 2024 DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/pe7ut  Alexa FluorTM 488 (1) is a bright green dye with excitation suited to the 488 nm laser line. Alexa FluorTM 
546 (2) is a bright orange dye that can be excited using 488 nm or 532 nm laser lines. Alexa Fluo rTM 647 (3) is 
a bright far -red dye with excitation suited to the 633 nm laser line, it contains a succinimidyl ester group that 
can react with the primary amines of  lysine residues. In some studies (4/60) the target membrane protein was 
conjugated to GFP, which can be excited by the 488 nm laser line. GFP from Aequorea victoria  (water jellyfish) 
is comprised of 238 amino acids (26.9 kDa) (UniProt P42212) and has a β-barrel structure with eleven β-
strands [22, 23]. The chromophore of GFP consists of the three amino acids Ser -dehydroTyr -Gly) (residues 
65-67), which have been mutated (F64LT) to create enhanced GFP (eGFP) that has increased fluorescence 
intensity, greater  photostability and higher efficiency compared to wild -type [24, 25]. Three of the studies 
(3/60) used the dye Cy5 (1,1′-dimethyl -3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine) ( 4) as fluorophore (Figure 2), 
which is a far -red fluorescent dye with excitation suite d to the 633 nm or 647 nm laser lines. Cy5 contains an 
amine group that can be reacted with activated esters and other electrophilic reagents. One study (1/60) used 
the zwitterionic red dye Atto -647 (5) as fluorophore (Figure 2), for which suitable excitat ion sources are next 
to the He:Ne laser (633 nm), the 647 nm line of the Krypton -Ion laser or a diode -laser emitting at 650 nm.  
6. Membrane proteins analysed by MST  
The different types of membrane proteins that have had biomolecular interactions characterised by MST 
include the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, GPCRs and other 
receptors, sensor kinases, ion channels, aquaporin s, transport proteins, and others.  
 
6.1. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  
In recent years eleven studies have employed  MST to analyse various interactions with th e SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein, which binds to the angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on target human cells . MST 
was used to measure the binding of bacterial ( Escherichia  coli) lipopolysaccharide to the full -length (residues 
16 to 1213) fluorescently -labelled SARS -CoV-2 spike protein, giving a K D of 46.7 ± 19.7 nM [26]. Various 
techniques were  used to investigate the molecular mechanism of how the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein 
augments lipopolysaccharide -mediated hyperinflammation, where the spike protein serves as a 
lipopolysaccharide delivery system to its receptors. This included use of MST to me asure the binding affinity 
of lipopolysaccharide to the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein Wuhan variant (K D = 46.7 ± 19.7 nM) and Omicron 
variant (K D = 3.3 ± 1.5 µM), of lipopolysaccharide to Wuhan S1 (K D = 50.0 ± 20.0 nM) and Omicron S1 (K D = 
4.6 ± 1.7 µM), and of lipid A to subunit Wuhan S1 (42.2 ± 24.4 nM) and Omicron S1 (K D = 0.6 ± 0.2 µM). 
Binding of lipopolysaccharide to Wuhan S2 (K D = 3.6 ± 1.6 µM) had a weaker affinity than for S1 [27]. 
In a study that used machine learning models to identify inhibitors of SARS -CoV-2 through the 
repurposing of existing drugs, MST was used to measure binding of the antimalarial drug lumefantrine to 
the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Residues 331 to 528 of the spike protein were 
expressed and purified and labelled with the amine reactive dye RED -NHS. Titration of lumefantrine with 
the spike protein RBD produced a K D of 259 ± 78 nM [28]. MST measured binding of the fungal defensin 
micasin from Microsporum canis  to the spike protein  RBD. The latter was labelled with the fluorescent dye 
NT−495−NHS and in MST experiments titrated with wild -type micasin and some mutant forms. Micasin 
bound to the spike protein RBD with a K D of 5.04 ± 0.96 µM [29]. A study used various computational and 
experimental approaches to identify molecules that could be optimised to improve anti -SARS-CoV-2 activity. 
Five beta -blockers (pindolol, carvedilol, carteolol, atenolol, and bisoprolol) against the SARS -CoV-2 spike 
protein RBD were identified. The highest affinity of these was carvedilol, for which MST measured a K D value 
of 364 ± 22 nM [30]. In a study that designed high -affinity affibody ligands for purification of the RBD from 
coronavirus spike proteins, MST was used to measure binding of ZRBD -02 (K D = 133.4 nM), ZRBD -04 (K D = 
377.3 nM), and ZRBD -07 (K D = 36.3 nM) to the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein RBD [31]. 
One of the studies designed and tested six synthetic ACE2 -based peptides to antagonise the interaction 
between ACE2 and the spike protein RBD based on m olecular docking with crystal structures of their 
interface.  The ability of the peptides to inhibit the ACE2 -spike-RBD interaction was tested using a luciferase 
assay, then the affinity of peptide binding to the spike -RBD protein was measured by MST. The purified 
spike-RBD protein was fluorescently labelled and incu bated with each peptide at a range of concentrations 
(12.5–0.00019 µ M). Some of the peptides had binding affinities in the low nanomolar range, with the highest 
affinity peptides having K D values of 13 and 45 nM [32]. In a different study synthetic α-helical peptides 
mimicking the α1-helix motif of the ACE2 receptor were tested as potential inhibitors of the ACE2 SARS -
CoV-2 interaction. A series of peptides N -capped with either Ac -βHAsp-[ProM-5] or Ac -βHAsp-PP were 
tested and MST measurements demonstrated a  strong binding affinity (K D = 62 nM) of an Ac -βHAsp-PP- 
6 
OSF Preprint 2024 DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/pe7ut  capped peptide for the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein RBD [33]. MST was used to confirm how C -2 thiophenyl 
tryptophan trimers inhibit cellular entry of SARS -CoV-2 through interaction with the spike protein.  MST 
measured binding of compounds to the spike protein and to its RBD, and also the effect of the compounds 
on interaction of the spike protein and its RBD with ACE2 [34]. Following a study to measure differential 
interactions between human ACE2 and the s pike RBD of SARS -CoV-2 variants of concern [35], a later study 
used a combination of steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation and experimental MST to quantify the 
interaction between the Omicron variant of the RBD and human ACE2 [36]. MST measurements o f binding 
between human ACE2 and different mutants of the RBD were directed by the SMD simulation. It was 
identified that Omicron produces an enhanced RBD -ACE2 interaction through mutations N501Y, Q498R and 
T478K in the RBD. The Omicron variant of the RBD had a five -fold higher affinity for ACE2 (K D = 5.5 ± 1.4 
nM) than did the wild-type RBD (K D = 27.5 ± 4.8 nM) , and higher affinities than the RBDs of the Alpha (K D = 
11.8 ± 0.8 nM), Beta (K D = 23.1 ± 2.4 nM) and Delta (K D = 21.5 ± 2.9 nM) variants [36]. 
 
6.2. G protein -coupled receptors  
Nine studies have employed MST to analyse binding interactions to different GPCRs. In a study that reported 
structure and function analyses of the purified GPCR human vomeronasal type 1 receptor 1, MST using 
native tryptoph an residues as the fluorophore showed binding of hVN1R1 to its ligand myrtenal, giving an 
EC50 of approximately 1 µM [37]. In three similar studies, MST was used to measure binding of human and 
mouse olfactory receptors and GPCRs solubilised with designer lipid -like peptides to their respective 
ligands. Here native tryptophan residues in the receptors were used as the fluore scence source for MST, and 
measured EC50 values ranged from 0.9 to 86 µM [38-40]. In a study reporting the cell -free expression, 
purification and ligand -binding analysis of olfactory receptors DmOR67a, DmOR85b and DmORCO from 
Drosophila melanogaster , MST was used to demonstrate that they bind their respective ligands. DmOR67a and 
DmORCO were titrated individually and together with ethyl benzoate, while DmOR85b and DmORCO were 
titrated individually and together with 2 -heptanone. When DmOR67a was co -incubated  with DmORCO, 
ethyl benzoate bound with an affinity of ~0.5 ± 0.1  µM, and when DmOR85b was co -incubated with 
DmORCO, 2 -heptanone bound with an affinity of ~0.8 ± 0.2  µM [41]. 
In a study that computationally designed and characterised nanobody -derived pepti des (NDPs) to 
stabilise the active conformation of the human β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), MST measure d binding of a 
selected 17 -residue NDP (P3) to the β2-AR. The agonist(isoproterenol) -activated β2-AR displayed a ~10 -fold 
higher affinity for P3 than th e unstimulated receptor, with EC 50 values of 3.57 µM and 58.22 µM, respectively 
[42]. MST was used to observe binding of the peptide neurotransmitter neurotensin (NT) to the human 
dopamine receptor 1 (D1) under native conditions in polymer -assembled Lipodisqs  (Figure 3). 
 
 
Figure 3. Binding of neurotensin (NT) to the human dopamine receptor 1 (D1) in polymer -assembled Lipodisqs. MST 
used Cy5 -labelled NT (NT -Cy5). The affinity of NT -Cy5 for D1 Lipodisqs was >300 nM. Denatured D1 Lipodisq s and 
Lipodisq s formed from HEK cells lacking D1 (red and green curves , respectively) did not show binding to NT. Error bars 
represent the standard error of n = 3 measurements. This figure was reproduced from Bada Juarez et al. (2020) [43].  
 
The Lipodisqs  were formed by adding the copolymer styrene -maleic acid (SMA) to membranes 
expressing D1 at a membrane:SMA w/w ratio of 1:1.5. MST measurements used Cy5 -labelled NT, which had 
an estimated binding affinity for D1 Lipodisqs of >300 nM  [43]. An MST method w as developed to measure 
ligand/receptor binding in non -purified samples of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). The concentration of 
D2R in mammalian cell plasma membranes from induced HekD2 cells was determined to be 36.8 ± 2.6 
 
7 
OSF Preprint 2024 DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/pe7ut  pmol/mg. Dose -response curves de termined the binding affinity (K D) for the fluorescent ligand spiperone —
Cy5 to be 5.3 ± 1.7 nM. To eliminate the possibility of non -specific binding between spiperone —Cy5 and the 
cell membranes, the measurements were performed both in the absence and in th e presence of the D2R 
antagonist haloperidol [44]. 
In a study demonstrating that down -regulation of the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) promotes 
preeclampsia by affecting actin polymerization, MST was used to observe direct binding of EPCR to proteas e-
activated receptor 1 (PAR -1), which is a GPCR  [45]. A plethora of techniques were used to identify 
macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as an atypical chemokine (ACK) that binds to chemokine 
receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 to promote atherogenic leukoc yte recruitment. This included use of MST to 
confirm the interaction between MST -Red-labelled MIF and platelet chemokine CXCL4L1. Titration of MST -
Red-MIF with increasing concentrations of CXCL4L1 produced a binding constant (K D = 159.8 ± 16.8 nM) that 
was similar to that obtained by SPR (K D = 116 ± 16 nM) [46]. 
 
6.3. Other receptors  
Various other receptors have been analysed by MST, including measurement of metallothionein binding to 
the lipocalin -2 (24p3/neutrophil gelatinase -associated lipocalin (NGAL)) receptor (SLC22A17) in CHO 
plasma membrane vesicles, giving an EC 50 of 123 ± 50 nM [47]. MST was used to characterise interactions 
between the membrane -bound mucin MUC4 and the ErbB2 receptor, which occurs at the cancer cell surface. 
Lysates of CHO cells w ere used that contained the transmembrane β subunit of MUC4 (MUC4 β) or a mutant 
containing only the EGF domains (MUC4EGF3+1+2). K D values for binding of ErbB2 to MUC4 β-ErbB2 and 
MUC4EGF3+1+2 were measured at 7 -25 nM and 65 -79 nM, respectively  [48]. 
MST was  used to analyse ligand -specific conformational states of the human glycine receptor (GlyR), 
which is a member of the pentameric ligand -gated ion channel (pLGIC) family. The fluorescent -labelled GlyR 
alpha-1 subunit was solubilised in amphipathic styrene -maleic acid copolymer nanodiscs. MST 
measurements showed that the full agonist glycine and the partial agonist taurine induced different 
conformational transitions on binding to the GlyR, giving EC 50 values of 65 ± 22.8 µM and 473.8 ± 66.1 µM, 
respectively (Figure 4). The results indicated that partial agonism in pLGIC proteins is reflected by the 
adaption of distinct receptor conformations [49].

amplitudes of 1.32 ± 0.14 compared to glycine -bound receptors with signal amplitudes of 3.38 ± 1.09. Data are shown in 
mean ± SD. This figure was reproduced from Bernhard and Laube (2020) [49].  
 
MST was used to measure bi nding of FIP -nha (a fungal immunomodulatory protein from Nectria 
haematococca ) to the labelled human epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR (K D = 15.54 ± 2.93 µM) [50]. In a 
study that performed in silico screening of the binding affinities of fifty curcumi n derivatives to the human 
EGFR by a molecular docking approach, MST was used to validate the results. The predicted EGFR -ligand 
binding constants were in the range of 0.00013 ± 0.00006 to 3.45 ± 0.10 µM. MST measured binding constants 
for curcumin (K D = 5.1 ± 0.33 µM), N -(3-nitrophenylpyrazole) curcumin (K D = 19.7 ± 2.1 µM), and derivative 
1A9 (K D = 4.9 ± 0.62 µM) [51]. 
A study demonstrated how the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin interacts with toll -like receptor 4 
(TLR4) to initiate proinflammatory signalling that underlies cisplatin toxicities. Soluble TLR4 blocked 
cisplatin -induced, but not lipopolysaccharide -induced, TLR4 activation. In MST experiments nickel and 
cisplatin, but not lipopolysaccharide, showed direct binding to human TLR4 with K D values of 2.72 µM and 
50.57 µM, respectively. Mouse TLR4 showed binding to cisplatin (K D = 104.9 µM) but not to nickel [52]. 
MST was used to measure binding of lipoprotein ligands to two human class B scavenger receptors, 
scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) and CD36, which are receptors for high -density lipoproteins and 
oxidized low -density lipoproteins, respectively.  Using receptors labelled with Cy5 at lysine residues, SR -B1 
bound to lipid -free apolipoprotein A -I with a K D of 82 ± 12 µg/ml or 2.73 ±  0.40 µM and to holoparticle high -
density lipoprotein (HDL) with a K D of 52 ± 9 µg/ml or 194 ± 34 nM. CD36 bound oxidized low -density 
lipoprotein (oxLDL) with a K D of 1.2 ± 0.5 mg/ml or 342.86 ± 285.71 nM and bound human HDL with a K D of 
33 ± 8 µg/ml or 12 3.36 ± 29.9 nM. There was no difference in affinity of SR -B1 for HDL or CD36 for oxLDL 
when comparing glycosylated and deglycosylated receptors [53]. 
MST was also used to measure binding of Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) to the human natural 
killer cel l receptor 2B4 (CD244) [54]. 
 
6.4. Sensor kinases  
MST has been used to analyse some histidine and tyrosine kinases. In a study that investigated interactions 
in the Cpx two component system of Escherichia coli , MST was used to measure binding affinities between 
the sensor histidine kinase CpxA with its cognate response regulator CpxR and its accessory protein CpxP. 
CpxA was reconstituted in MSP1D1 nanodiscs and MST measurements used fluorescently -labelled CpxA -
Strep or MSP1D1. CpxA had a high affinity for CpxR (K D = 3.7 ± 0.5 µM), which was increased by around 10 -
fold by phosphorylation (K D = 0.55 ± 0.06 µM). The affinity between CpxA and CpxP was much lower (K D 
>100 µM) [55]. 
A range of biophysical techniques a nd cell-based assays were used to identify a highly selective small 
molecule inhibitor of lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3), which is a dual specificity serine/threonine kinase 
with an oncogenic role in various tumour types and a viable therapeutic target. T he analyses included use of 
MST to obtain binding curves for the new inhibitor C36 (K D = 1.87 ± 0.2 µM) and an existing inhibitor C28 
(KD = 2.50 ± 0.4 µM) with human LMTK3 [56]. 
 
6.5. Ion channels  
Several studies have used MST to analyse interactions with the voltage -dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) . 
In a study that looked at mediation of the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl -xL protein upon interaction with 
mouse VDAC1, MST was used to observe binding of fluorescently labelled Bcl -xL to VDAC1, giving a 
binding affinity of 0.67 µM [57]. In a study that demonstrated direct modulation of human VDAC1 by 
cannabidiol (CBD), MST was used to show a direct interaction between purified fluorescently labelled 
VDAC1 and CBD, giving a K D of 11.2 ± 6  µM [58]. In a study tha t demonstrated how VDAC1 mediates 
amyloid β (Aβ) toxicity and is a potential target for Alzheimer ’s disease therapy, MST was used to observe  
9 
OSF Preprint 2024 DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/pe7ut  Aβ binding to fluorescently -labelled human VDAC1 with a K D of 50 µm. In an MST experiment using 
intrinsic VDAC1 try ptophan fluorescence, A β binding resulted in a K D of 16.6 µM [59]. Seventeen small -
molecule compounds were screened for interaction with  human mitochondrial  VDAC1 using nano -
differential scanning fluorimetry and MST  (Figure 5). The dissociation constants for fifteen of the compounds 
were measured by MST with six successfully determined: DIDS (K D = 0.5 µM), VBIT4 (K D = 3 µM), 
itraconazole (K D = 5 µM), cannabidiol (K D = 6 µM), curcumin (K D = 6 µM), emodin (K D = 10 µM). It was noted 
that DIDS is likely to int eract covalently with VDAC1, which should be considered in evaluating the 
measured K D. Four of the compounds (cannabidiol, curcumin, DIDS and VBIT4) were identified as potential 
starting points for future design of VDAC1 selective ligands  [60]. In a study that demonstrated how a 
cholesterol analogue induces an oligomeric reorganization of VDAC, MST was used to measure binding of 
hexokinase isoform I (HK -I) to VDAC from Neurospora crassa , giving a binding constant of 27 ± 6 µM in the 
presence of cholesteryl -hemisuccinate. There was no binding of hexokinase isoform II (HK -II) [61]. 
 
 
Figure 5. MST dose -response curves of eight compounds with human mitochondrial VDAC1. Precise or minimum K D 
values are displayed for cannabidiol, curcumin, DIDS, emodin, itraconazole, VBIT4, propofol and fluoxetine. Error bars 
show standard deviation obtained from three replicas of the same measurement. This figure was reproduced from Gorny 
et al. (2023) [60].  
 
In a study of competitive interactions between the phosphoinositide regulator of TRP (PIRT), the cold 
sensing ion channel TRPM8, and the signalling phosphoinositide lipid PIP2, MST was used identify a 
competitive PIRT interaction between PIP2 and the TRPM 8 S1-S4 transmembrane domain [62].  
MST measure d binding of the tarantula gating -modifier toxins ProTx -II and GpTx -I to the voltage 
sensing domain (VSD) of repeat II of the human voltage -gated sodium channel NaV1.7  [63]. Residues 732 -
860, which contain thr ee transmembrane helices, were recombinantly expressed, purified and reconstituted 
 
10 
OSF Preprint 2024 DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/pe7ut  in DMPC lipids. For MST, VSD2 in DMPC was titrated into 50 nM toxins fluorescently labelled with Alexa 
FluorTM 488. Binding affinities (K D values) for ProTx -II and GpTx -I were measured at 200 nM (160 -250 nM) 
and 700 nM (300 -1500), respectively. In comparison, IC 50 values for ProTx -II inhibition of full -length NaV1.7 
in membranes had been reported in the range 0.3 -3 nM. Mutations F813A and D816A in VSD2 increased the 
KD values for GpTx -I binding to 300 nM (600 -3000) and 5000 nM (3000 -15,000 nM), respectively [63]. 
In a study that demonstrated how chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) activity is not required for 
glioblastoma development, but its inhibition dictates glio ma stem cell responsivity to novel biguanide 
derivatives, MST was used to measure the interaction of two biguanide compounds (Q48 and Q54) with 
recombinant CLIC1 protein. CLIC1 was labelled with red and blue dye kits and dose -response curves 
measured bindi ng affinities of K D = 15.6 ± 1.9  µM and K D = 1.9 ± 0.5 mM for Q48 and Q54, respectively  [64]. 
MST was used to measure direct interactions between phosphoinositides and potassium channel KcsA. 
Using a range of phospholipids it was found that there was a gen eral increase in binding affinity with the 
number of negative charges. The phosphoinositides PI(4)P (phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate), PI(3,4)P2 
(phosphatidylinositol 3,4 -bisphosphate), PI(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5 -bisphosphate), PI(3,4,5)P3 
(phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 -trisphosphate) with two to four net negative charges produced greater binding 
effects than POPC (1 -palmitoyl -2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine) with no charge, and POPG (1 -palmitoyl -2-
oleoylphosphatidylglycerol) and PI (phosphatidylinositol ) with one net negative charge  [65]. 
MST was also used to measure the direct interaction between the purified voltage -gated proton channel 
(Hv1) from mouse and ATP [66]. 
 
6.6. Aquaporins  
MST has been used to measure interactions with some aquaporins. In a study that demonstrated how 
phosphorylation of human aquaporin 2 (AQP2) allosterically controls its interaction with the lysosomal 
trafficking regulator -interacting protein LIP5, MST was used to measure binding of fluorescently -labelled 
LIP5 to wild -type and mutant forms of AQP2. Non -phosphorylated wild -type AQP2 bound LIP5 with the 
highest affinity (K D = 191 ± 43.2 n M), whilst AQP2 -ΔP242 had 20 -fold lower affinity (K D = 3.63 ± 0.44 µM). 
AQP2-S256E (K D = 1.00 ± 0.25 µM), S261E (K D = 745 ± 141 n M), T269E (K D = 721 ± 55.0 n M), and S256E/T269E 
(KD = 652.7 ± 62.2 n M) all had reduced affinity. AQP2 -S264E had an affinity similar to non -phosphorylated 
wild-type AQP2 (K D = 278 ± 49.1 n M) [67]. More recently, a protocol was developed for characterizing the 
binding between a human aquaporin and a soluble interaction partner using MST [68], and MST was used 
to measure the interaction of Zea mays  aquaporin ZmPIP2;5 with the jasmonic acid analogue coronatine [69]. 
 
6.7. Transporters  
Interactions with a variety of transport proteins have been analysed by MST , including binding of purine and 
pyrimidine nucleosides to equilibrative nucleoside transporter 7 (ENT7) from Arabidopsis thaliana  fused with 
eGFP [70]. An MST ligand -binding assay for characterising solute carriers was demonstrated using the SLC15 
oligopeptide transporter PepT1. An SLC15A1/PepT1 ortholog from the moss Physcomitrella patens  (PepTPp), 
which is highly similar to  human PepT1, was expressed in yeast. The method compared the analysis of 
solubilised total membrane preparations with or without expression of PepTPp, using a yeast strain 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), in which the corresponding endogenous SLC homolog is de pleted and using the 
dipeptide glycylsarcosine (Gly -Sar) and the antiviral prodrug valacyclovir as test ligands. Gly -Sar was bound 
in the mM range and valacyclovir had a K D of around 50 µM [71]. 
In a study that dissected the protonation sites for antibacte rial recognition and transport in the 
multidrug efflux transporter QacA from Staphylococcus aureus , MST was used to measure binding of 
substrates to purified wild -type and mutant forms of QacA. Wild -type QacA had K D values for binding 
tetraphenylphosphoniu m, pentamidine and dequalinium of 0.36 ± 0.07 mM, 1 ± 0.17 mM and 0.90 ± 0.21 mM, 
respectively [72]. 
In a study that identified a grafted hyaluronic acid N -acetyl-l-methionine (HA -ADH-AcMet) to target 
the human  L-type amino acid transporter -1 (LAT1), MST w as used to measure the binding affinity of different 
ligands to LAT1. The highest affinity ligand was HA -ADH-AcMet with a K D of 408 nM [73]. 
In a study investigating functional sites in the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) efflux protein NorA 
from Staphylococcus aureus , MST was used to measure the binding of tetraphenylphosphonium chloride to 
GFP-fused wild -type and mutant NorA. GFP was fused between residues 153 and 154 of NorA, flanked by a 
peptide ‘GGSGG’. Tetraphenylphosphonium chloride binding to GF P-NorA and a multisite mutation 
(F16A/E222A/F303A/D307A) of GFP -NorA had K D values of 7.6 ± 2 mM and 16.7 ± 6 mM, respectively [74].  
11 
OSF Preprint 2024 DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/pe7ut  Along with other techniques, MST was used in a study of the structural basis for arsenite binding and 
translocation of the Acr3 antiporter from Bacillus subtilis  [75]. Acr3 is an efflux pump that confers resistance 
to arsenite, it has nine transmembrane helices that display a typical NhaA structure fold, with two 
discontinuous helices of transmembrane segments (TM4 and TM9) in teracting with each other and forming 
an X-shaped structure. MST measured arsenite binding to GFP -labelled wild-type Acr3 and individual 
mutants of Acr3 (R118A, N144A, E295A, E322A) to give K D values of 2.9, 14.8, 11.9,19.6 and 27.5 mM, 
respectively (Figure 6). The study identified motif C in TM9 to be a critical for substrate binding, in which 
N292 and E295 are involved in substrate coordination, while R118 in TM4 and E322 in TM10 are responsible 
for structural stabilization. Highly conserved residue s on motif B in TM5 were found to be important in the 
protonation/deprotonation process [75].

Bacillus subtilis . Affinity analysis with a K D model and fitted by fraction bound normalisation. Experiments were 
conducted in triplicate. This figure was reproduced from Lv et al. (2022) [75].  
 
A comprehensive study on the energy coupling and stoichiometry of Zn2+/H+ antiport by the cation 
diffusion  facilitator YiiP from Shewanella oneidensis  used MST to assess the binding affinity of individual Zn2+ 
binding sites and to explore the basis for coupling of Zn2+ transport to the proton -motive force [76]. YiiP 
functions as a homodimer and has three disti nct Zn2+ binding sites referred to as A, B and C. Site A is in the 
transmembrane domain and has three Asp and one His residue where it is alternately exposed to the 
cytoplasm or to the periplasm in inward - and outward -facing states, respectively. Site B is  on the loop 
between transmembrane helices 2 and 3 and has two His and one Asp residue. Site C is in the C -terminal 
domain and is a binuclear site (C1 and C2) with four His and two Asp residues. For assessing Zn2+ binding 
to individual Zn2+ binding sites a  series of mutants was used to isolate the individual sites. The triple mutant 
D70A/D287A/H263A was used to study site A, D51A/D287A/H263A was used to study site B, and 
D51A/D70A was used to study site C. At pH 7, MST measured relatively high affinity for sites A and C with 
KD values of 16 nM and 33 nM, respectively, and lower affinity for site B with a K D value of 1.2 µM. When 
further mutations were introduced to isolate the individual C1 (D51A/D70A/H263A) and C2 
(D51A/D70A/H234A) sites, the binding affini ty was reduced to give K D values of 153 nM and 223 nM, 
respectively, suggesting cooperative binding of Zn2+ at C1 and C2  [76]. The basis for coupling of Zn2+ transport 
to the proton -motive force was investigated by measuring Zn2+ binding affinities at pH values of 5.6 to 7.4.  
 
6.8. Other membrane proteins  
In a study that investigated unwinding of the substrate transmembrane helix in intramembrane proteolysis, 
MST measure d binding of a chimeric substrate MBP -Gurken-TMD to wild -type and mutant forms of the 
intramembrane -cleaving proteases (I -CLiPs) rhomboid protease GlpG from Escherichia coli and MCMJR1 
from archaea. GlpG and MCMJR1 were labelled with fluorescent dye NT -647. MBP -Gurken-TMD bound to 
wild-type and a mutant (H254A) of G lpG in 0.1% DDM with K D values of ∼1.4 µM and ∼0.7 µM, respectively  
(Figure 7). Binding did not reach saturation because a higher concentration of substrate could not be achieved 
due to aggregation. MBP -Gurken-TMD bound to MCMJR1 in 0.1% DDM with a K D of ∼9 µM [77].

variant in 0.1% DDM. This figure was reproduced from Brown et al. (2018) [77].  
 
In a study that demonstrated how lysosomal integral membrane protein -2 (LIMP -2/SCARB2) is 
involved in lysosomal cholesterol export, MST was used to detect a direct interaction between fluorescently 
labelled human LIMP -2 and cholesterol, giving an EC 50 of 112 ± 32 nM [78]. In a study that demonstrated how 
human tetraspanin CD82 interacts with cholesterol to promote extracellular vesicle -mediated release of ezrin 
to inhibit tumour cell movement, MST was used to determine the cholesterol -binding affinity of CD82. MST 
was performed on GFP -labelled wild -type and LYK mutant CD82 proteins expressed at similar levels in 
Du145 cells. Cholesterol bound to CD82 -wild-type with a K D of 5.89 µM but did not bind to CD82 -LYK [79]. 
MST was used to show how the human phosphoinositide -interacting regulator of TRP (PIRT) binds 
calmodulin and cholesterol -like ligands. PIRT had high affinity for calcium -free calmodulin (apo -CaM) and 
lower affinity for calcium bound calmodulin, with K D values of 350 ± 40 nM and 60 ± 30 µM, respectively. 
Cholesteryl -hemisuccinate had a K D of 103 ± 6  µM, and cortisol and β-estradiol had K D values of 790 ± 60 µM 
and 800 ± 100 µM, respectively. Despite the structural similarity of testosterone to cholesterol, cortisol and β-
estradiol, it did not show binding to PIRT [80]. 
Occludin is a tetramembrane -spanning tight junction protein, which possesses a bundle of three α-
helices that mediates interactions with other tight junction components. A study demonstrated that serine 
408 phosphorylation is a molecular switch that regulates structure and function of occludin, where a short 
unstructured region next to the α-helical bundle is a hotspot for phosphorylation. Here NMR was used to 
define the effects of S408 phosphorylation on intramolecular interactions between the unstructured region 
and the α-helical b undle, then paramagnetic relaxation enhancement and MST were used to demonstrate 
that the unstructured region interacts with the α-helical bundle, and binding was enhanced by S408 
phosphorylation [81]. 
MST with nanodiscs was used to confirm the micromolar affinity of perforin for calcium ions, which is 
required for perforin interaction with the membrane.  MSP nanodiscs containing 1 -palmitoyl -2-oleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1,2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) labelled 
with fluorescent dye Atto -647 (DOPEAtto -647) were used to reconstitute human and mouse perforin, giving 
KD values of 123 ± 33 µM and 26 ± 5.8 µM, respectively [82]. 
Using multiple biophysical techniques, it was demonstrated that human mitochondrial fission protein  
1 (Fis1) directly interacts with dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) in an evolutionarily conserved manner to 
promote mitochondrial fission. For MST experiments, Fis1 with its N -terminal arm removed (Fis1 ∆N9-125) and 
Drp1 were covalently modified at methioni ne residues with a Cy5 -azide fluorophore. Propargyl oxaziridine 
was used to generate a sulfimide conjugate to methionine containing a terminal alkyne, then copper click 
chemistry was used to attach Cy5. In MST experiments monitoring Cys5 -Drp1 fluorescence,  30 µM Drp1 was 
titrated with Fis1 ∆N to give an apparent affinity (app K D) of Drp1 for Fis1 ∆N of 12 ± 2 µM (Figure  8) [83].

7. Conclusion  
In reviewing the analysis of membrane proteins by MST we have consolidated the opinion that MST is a 
useful technique for studying biomolecular interactions with membrane proteins. This is because MST has 
no limitations on the size of the target biomolecule, on the affinity of the interaction being studied or on the 
composition of the buffer and other sample components, and it uses much less sample compared to other 
techniques that measure biomolecular interactions. Different types of membrane proteins from different 
organisms have been studied by MST with the protein  in cell lysates or native membranes, solubilised in 
detergents, or reconstituted in lipids, nanodiscs or Lipodisqs. Very few studies have used intrinsic aromatic 
residues as the fluorophore for MST measurements on membrane proteins. The large majority of studies have 
used membrane proteins labelled with different fluorescent dyes or conjugated with GFP. It is important that 
the sample conditions and the labelling strategy being used for MST measurements do not adversely affect 
the native structure and acti vity of the protein. The best studies are therefore those that use other biophysical 
and biochemical techniques alongside MST to test the structural integrity and activity of the membrane 
protein under the same conditions as those used for MST.  The many in teractions that MST can measure with 
membrane proteins include those with other proteins and peptides, nucleic acids, detergents and lipids, 
liposomes and vesicles, or small molecules and ions. MST is therefore a useful technique to have in drug 
screening projects with membrane protein targets.
