Abstract
Infections caused by antibiotic resistant luminescent vibrios can cause considerable losses in aquaculture. In this study, different
short-chain fatty acids were investigated as possible alternative biocontrol agents. The addition of 100 mM formic, acetic,propionic, butyric or valeric acid to the growth medium of a pathogenic Vibrio campbellii strain completely inhibited its growth at
pH 6. At 10 mM, the growth of the pathogen was delayed, whereas at 1 mM, no effect could be observed. The growth-inhibitory
effect was clearly pH-dependent and decreased with increasing pH. An in vivo challenge test with gnotobiotic Artemia franciscana
nauplii revealed that all five short-chain fatty acids protected the shrimp from the pathogenic V . campbellii strain. The addition of
20 mM of the short-chain fatty acids to the culture water resulted in a significantly increased survival of infected nauplii, with no
difference between the different fatty acids. In conclusion, our data indicate that short-chain fatty acids might be useful asalternative biocontrol agents to treat luminescent vibriosis.

1. Introduction
FAO reports consider diseas e outbreaks as a significant
constraint to the development of the aquaculture sectorworldwide ( Subasinghe et al., 2001 ). Infections caused by
luminescent vibrios are considered to be an importantproblem in the intensive rear ing of molluscs, finfish,
lobsters and especially shrim p, where mortality can be as
high as 100% ( Pass et al., 1987; Alvarez et al., 1998;
Lavilla-Pitogo et al., 1998; Diggles et al., 2000 ).Traditionally, these problems are treated by applying
antimicrobials. Many farmers also use antibiotics in aprophylactic way, even when pathogens are not evident(Moriarty, 1999 ). This practice has resulted in the
development of (multiple ) antibiotic resistance ( Teo et al.,
2000; Teo et al., 2002 ), which makes antibiotic treatments
ineffective in controlling the disease ( Karunasagar et al.,
1994). Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative
control techniques.
Several studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids
inhibit the growth of yeast and enterobacteria such as
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ,Escherichia coli
and Shigella flexneri (Wolin, 1969; Cherrington et al.,
1991; Sun et al., 1998; Van Immerseel et al., 2003 ).

doi:10.1016/j.aquaculture.2006.06.038Although the antibacterial mechanism(s) of these com-
pounds are not completely understood, they are capable ofexhibiting bacteriostatic an d bactericidal properties
depending on the physiological status of the organismsand the physicochemical characteristics of the externalenvironment ( Ricke, 2003 ). In the undissociated form, the
short-chain fatty acids can pass through the cellmembrane of the bacteria and dissociate in the more
alkaline cytoplasm, thereby increasing the intracellular
concentration of protons ( Cherrington et al., 1991 ).
Consequently, the cells have to expend energy in orderto maintain the intracellular pH at the optimal level. Thisenergy cannot be used for other metabolic processes andtherefore, growth of the cells is inhibited.In this study, we investigated the bacteriostatic
capacities of different short-chain fatty acids in vitro
and we aimed at testing whether these compounds couldbe useful as new biocontrol agents for aquaculture,using Artemia franciscana as a model.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Effect of the short-chain fatty acids on growth of V .
campbellii LMG21363
Formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acid were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Bornem, Belgium) anddissolved in LB-medium at diff erent concentrations (1, 10
Fig. 1. Growth of V . campbellii LMG21363 (OD 600) in LB-medium at pH 6 with and without different short-chain fatty acids, added at different
concentrations. The fatty acids tested were formic acid (panel A), acetic acid (panel B), propionic acid (panel C), butyric acid (panel D) and valeric
acid (panel E). The data points are the mean values of 3 replicates. Symbols are —●—: no fatty acid; ········ ○·······: 1 mM, –––▾––– : 10 mM,

after which they were filter sterilised. The sterile mediawere inoculated with a V . campbellii culture (diluted to an
OD
600of 1) at 20 μl culture per ml medium. The
suspensions were incubated at 28 °C for 10 h and theoptical density (600 nm) was measured every hour. In asecond experiment, 20 mM solutions of formic and valeric
acid in LB-medium were prepared after which the pH was
adjusted to 5, 6 or 7, respectively. The solutions wereinoculated with V . campbellii and incubated at 28 °C for
15 h. Again, the optical density (600 nm) was measuredevery hour.
2.2. In vivo challenge tests
In vivo challenge tests were performed as described
previously ( Defoirdt et al., 2005 ). Briefly, Artemia cysts
were decapsulated and hatched for 30 h at 28 °C. Afterhatching, groups of 20 nauplii were transferred to sterilefalcon tubes containing a sterile 20 mM solution of theshort-chain fatty acids in filtered and autoclaved artificialseawater (pH was adjusted to 7). The nauplii were fedwith an autoclaved suspension of Aeromonas hydrophila
LVS3 (at approx. 10
7CFU ml−1) and V . campbellii
LMG21363 was added to the culture water at approx.10
5CFU ml−1. The falcon tubes with the nauplii were
incubated on a rotor at 28 °C and Artemia survival was
measured 2 days after the addition of the pathogen.
2.3. Statistics
Different treatments were compared by independent
samples t-tests, using the SPSS software, version 12.0.
Differences were considered significant if the P-value of
thet-test was below 0.05.3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of short-chain fatty acids on growth of V .
campbellii LMG21363
In an initial experiment, we investigated the effect of
formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acid on thegrowth of the shrimp pathogen V . campbellii
LMG21363 in liquid growth medium. At pH 6, all
fatty acids completely inhibited the growth of V.
campbellii at a concentration of 100 mM ( Fig. 1 ),
whereas there was no effect on growth of the pathogenat 1 mM and at 10 mM, the growth of the strain was notcompletely inhibited but showed a longer lag phase thanwithout fatty acids. Our data indicate that the concen-trations of short-chain fatty acids needed to inhibit the
growth of V . campbellii are in the same order as those
for enteric bacteria. Indeed, Wolin (1969) reported a
partial inhibition of the growth of E. coli by approxi-
mately 10 mM of short-chain fatty acid at pH 6 and Van
Immerseel et al. (2003) also reported that the growth of
S. enterica subsp. enterica was completely inhibited by
100 mM fatty acid at pH 6.
In a second in vitro experiment, we studied the in-
fluence of pH on the growth-inhibitory activity of the
fatty acids. For both fatty acids (at a concentration of20 mM), the growth-inhibitory effect clearly decreasedwith increasing pH. At pH 5, growth was completelyinhibited; at pH 6, growth was delayed and at pH 7, noinhibition could be observed. The results for valeric acidare shown in Fig. 2 . Similar pH-dependent effects have
been reported for the inhibition of the growth of E. coli ,
and S. enterica subsp. enterica by short-chain fatty
acids ( Wolin, 1969; McHan and Shotts, 1993; Van Im-
merseel et al., 2003 ). The pH-dependent effect can be

membrane only in their undissociated form, which ismore dominant at lower pH ( Sun et al., 1998 ).
3.2. Effect of the short-chain fatty acids on survival of
Artemia nauplii infected with V . campbellii LMG21363
Since the short-chain fatty acids were found to inhibit
the growth of V . campbellii LMG21363, we investigated
whether these compounds could protect Artemia nauplii
from the pathogen in an in vivo challenge test. The fatty
acids significantly enhanced the survival of infected nauplii
(Table 1 ), with no significant difference between the
different fatty acids. Furth er increasing the fatty acid
concentration to 100 mM did not further increase thesurvival of the nauplii (data not shown). We presume that
the addition of the short-chain fatty acids in the culture
water limited pathogen colonisation by conversion of theacids into their respective antibacterial forms in thedigestive tract of Artemia . However, apart from inhibiting
the growth of V . campbellii , the protection offered by the
short-chain fatty acids might also be due to a feed effect.Indeed, it has been shown before that the susceptibility of
Artemia nauplii to pathogenic bacteria decreases if they
are fed a better quality feed ( Marques et al., 2005 ). Short-
chain fatty acids are known to provide mammals (andespecially the mammalian colonic mucosa) with energy(Topping and Clifton, 2001 ), which might also be the case
forArtemia . However, we did not observe higher survival
in starved nauplii treated with short-chain fatty acids whencompared to untreated nauplii (data not shown), whichindicates that the amount of energy obtained from the fatty
acids is rather limited.
Short-chain fatty acids have previously been shown to
inhibit or decrease the growth of Salmonella in chickens
(Waldroup et al., 1995; van der Wielen et al., 2000; Van
Immerseel et al., 2005 ). In fact, these compounds are
already used in commercial mixtures to control Salmo-
nella in poultry ( Van Immerseel et al., 2002 ). Interesting-
ly,Vázquez et al. (2005) have recently shown that acetic
acid had an inhibitory effect towards Vibrio alginolyticus ,
Vibrio pelagius andVibrio anguillarum . Our data indicate
that short-chain fatty acids might also be useful forcontrolling luminescent vibriosis in aquaculture. Howev-er, it would economically and practically not be feasible todose the fatty acids in the culture water of an aquaculturesystem since the effective concentrations are rather high.Therefore, further research will be necessary in order to
provide more elegant methods to deliver the short-chain
fatty acids to the digestive tract of the animals. Onepossibility could be the application of microencapsulatedfatty acid particles (as used in poultry diets; VanImmerseel et al., 2005 ). Unfortunately, we were not able
to test the microencapsulated fatty acid particles used inpoultry diets in our model system since those particles aretoo large to be ingested by Artemia .
