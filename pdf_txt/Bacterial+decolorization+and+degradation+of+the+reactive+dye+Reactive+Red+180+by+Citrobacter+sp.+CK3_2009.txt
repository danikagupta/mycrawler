          ABSTRACT                          
Introduction  
Various chemical substances discharged 
from the industries become a persistent 
environmental contaminant. Due to rapid 
industrialization and urbanization, a lot of 
chemicals including dyes, pigments, and 
aromatic molecular structural compounds 
were widely used in several industrial 
applications such as textiles, printing, 
pharmaceuticals, food, toys, paper, plastic 
and cosmetics (Mohana et al ., 2008). 
Textile processing industries were found 
in most of the countries and their numbers         have been increased. These industries have 
shown a significant increase in the use of 
synthetic dyes as a coloring material. The 
annual world production of textiles is 
about 30 million tones requiring 700,000 
tonnes of different dyes (Zollinger ., 1987). 
The dyes includes such as acidic, reactive, 
basic, disperse, azo, diazo, anthraquinone 
dyes which causes a considerable 
environmental pollution problems. The 
effluent from the dyeing and desizing 
processes contributes to the high colorant ISSN: 2319 -7706 Volume 3 Number 3 (2014) pp. 421-436

environmental concerns. The usage of synthetic dyes increases in many areas. 
Among the synthetic dyes, reactive dyes are most commonly used in all industries. 
Reactive dye is one of the prominent and widely used types of azo dye with 
different reactive groups. Reactive dyes that emanate from dyeing industries 
increases Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Biological Oxygen Demand 
(BOD), change the pH of water bodies and it causes serious problems in plant, 
animal and human beings. Conventional waste water treatment are too expensive 
since they produce large amount of perilous byproducts, muck production and 
disposal problem, so biological treatment is relatively inexpensive way to remove 
dyes from waste water. The successful removal of dyes from effluent is  depends on 
the deployment of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, microalgae etc to 
convert the pollutants into non - toxic substances. Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(3): 421-436

content and chemical oxygen demand of 
the total drainage. The dyes present in 
textile effluent give persistent color to the 
receiving streams and interfere with 
photosynthesis in aquatic flora 
(Cunningham and Saigo, 2001). Effluent 
that release from the production process of 
textiles is not properly disposed, can cause 
grave environmental pollution, sometimes 
to levels that can threaten human health, 
livestock, wildlife, aquatic lives and 
collapse the entire ecosystem. Presence of 
dyes in the effluent causes an unpleasant 
appearance by imparting the color and its 
breakdown products are toxic, 
carcinogenic and mutagenic (Conneely et 
al., 1999; Xu et al., 2005).  
Dyes  
Unlike most organic compounds, dyes 
have color because they a) absorb light in 
the visible spectrum; b) have atleast one 
chromophore; c) have a conjugated 
system, (i.e.) a structure with alternating 
double and single bonds and d)exhibit 
resonance of electrons, which is a 
stabilizing force in organic compounds 
(Abrahart , 1977). Dyes contain one or 
more azo groups (i.e., azo dyes)  include by 
far the largest family of organic dyes. 
Distinguished types of dyes are, 1) Acid 
dyes for protein and polyamide substance 
such as nylon, wool and silk; 2) Dispense 
dyes for polyesters and acetate and 3) 
Direct and reactive dyes for cellulosic 
materials such as cotton, rayon, linen and 
paper. 
Reactive Dyes  
Reactive dyes have intricated 
chemical structures which form covalent 
bonds between the reactive groups of 
cellulose and agiled functional groups of 
dye molecules. Reactive dyes are the most 
common dyes because of many advantages 
such as operating at mild conditions, give bright colors and stable structures (Wang 
and Lewis, 2002 and Xie et al., 2008). 
Reactive dyes are nitrogen  
containing 
heterocyclic rings carrying halogen 
substituents, therefore undergo 
nucleophilic substitution reaction with the 
cellulose fiber. The heteroatom activates 
the system for nucleophilic attack due to 
its electro-negativity. The attacking 
nucleophile can be either a cellulose anion 
or a hydroxyl ion. This conducts fixation 
on the fabric, after hydrolysis occurs on 
the reactive dye and it is also important for 
a dye molecule to have a high dye  
fabric 
covalent fixation value (Al  
Degs et al., 
2000).  
There are different types of reactive dyes 
with various reactive groups (i.e) with 
various reactive systems that react with 
substrate to form covalent bonds (Table 1). 
The chromophore of their molecules are 
very similar i.e., either azo, anthraquinone, 
phthalocyanine chromophore or others. 
The general formula for the reactive dyes 
structure is as follows.

Reactive dyes composed of two portions  
The chromogen and b) The reactive 
system (Waring and Hallas., 1990) .  
Reactive dyes are characterized by azo 
bonds (N=N), and used to dye cellulose 
fibres. The color of the azo dyes is due to 
the presence of azo bond with associated 
chromophores (Moreira et al., 1998.). 
Reactive dyes are azo compounds that are 
linked by an azo bridge. (Raymound and 
Dunald, 1984). Reactive dyes are typically Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(3): 421-436

azo based chromphores with various 
reactive groups, some examples for 
reactive dyes are Procion yellow MX- 5B, 
Cibacron brilliant red B, Drimaren red Z  
2B, reactive black 5 (fig. 1), Reactive 
yellow 2, Procion Blue MX 2G, Remazol 
red RB, Remazol Golden Yellow RNL, 
Remazol Blue B, Remazol Turquoise Blue 
G133, Remazol blue and Remazol orange 
etc., which shows different reactivity and 
it has different absorbance (Table 2) .  
Impacts of reactive dyes  
Effluent from the industries containing 
reactive dyes causes serious environment 
pollution because, the presence of dyes in 
water is highly visible and affects their 
transparency  and aesthetic even if the 
concentration of the dyes is low (Hao et 
al., 2000).Reactive dyes cause respiratory 
and nasal symptoms (Docker et al., 1987); 
asthma rhinitis and dermatitis (Nilsson et 
al., 1993); allergic contact dermatitis 
(Estlander, 1988; Wilkinson and 
MCGeachan.,1996), mutagenicity (Mathur 
et al., 2005; Przybojewska et al., 1989), 
genotoxicity (Dogan et al., 2005; 
Przybojewska et al., 1989), 
carcinogenicity (De- Roos et al., 2005; 
Gonzales et al ., 1988) and teratogenicity 
(Birhanli and Ozmen, 2005). Adverse 
effects have also been detected from 
aquatic environment (Richardson, 1983; 
Michaels and Lewis, 1985). Dyes have a 
very low rate of removal ratio for BOD to 
COD (less than 0.1) (De and Radrigues, 
1987). Therefore, industrial effluents 
containing dyes should be processed 
before their discharge into the 
environment (Wong et al., 2003).  
Microbial discoloration of reactive dyes  
Effluents from the textile industries 
contain reactive dye in a concentration range of 5-1500mg/L. Processing of dye 
contaminated effluents is currently a 
primary environmental problem (Lata et 
al., 2007). Conventional treatment 
methods such as activated sludge process, 
chemical coagulation, carbon absorption, 
chemical oxidation, photo decomposition, 
electro- chemical treatment, reverse 
osmosis, hydrogen peroxide catalysis etc 
are difficult, ineffective (or) economic 
disadvantage(Gong et al., 2005; 
Viyaraghavan and Yun, 2008). Some of 
these techniques are even effective, 
although they have some shortcomings, 
they are: excess amount of chemical usage 
with obvious disposal problem; costly 
plant requirements (or) operating 
expenses; lack of ef fective color reduction; 
particularly for sulfonated azo dyes; 
sensitivity to a waste water input. 
Techniques by chemical oxidation using 
sodium hypochlorite to remove the color 
release a lot of aromatic amines which are 
carcinogenic or toxic compounds (An liker, 
1979). Physical and chemical methods are 
effective for color removal but need of 
more energy and chemicals than biological 
processes and sometimes it causes 
pollution into solid or liquid side streams 
and it requires additional treatment or 
disposal (Table 3). So, the treatment of 
dyes focus on some microorganisms which 
are to biodegrade and biosorb dye in waste 
water. Number of microorganisms 
possesses dye decolorizing ability like 
bacteria, fungi and yeast  
Biosorption  
Biosorption defined as the property of 
certain biomolecules to bind and 
concentrate selected ions/ other molecules 
from aqueous solution. Biosorption with 
microorganism, especially fungus as latent 
sorbent for removal of dyes from 
industrial effluents has gained Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(3): 421-436   
424 
considerable attention. Decoloring of 
synthetic dyes and dye effluents (Mehna et 
al., 1995; Revankar and Lele, 2007; 
Binupriya et al., 2007) have been reported 
by using various fungi. Bacteria and fungi 
have been used for decolorization of 
effluent containing dye (Benito et al., 
1997). Tramates versicolor mycelium 
adsorbs dye of 5-10% and Aspergillus 
niger adsorb 10-25%; (Miranda et al., 
1996). Most of the work was focused on 
the biosorption of dyes by bacterial 
biomass. With respect to bacterial dye 
biosorption, Won et al. (2005) observed 
Corynebacterium glutamicum as a latent 
biosorbent of Reactive red 4. Aeromonas 
sp, Pseudomonas luteola , E. coli , 
Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus 
aureus are used as biosorbent for the 
removal of reactive dyes like reactive blue, 
reactive red, reactive violet and reactive 
yellow (Hu, 1996).    
Actinomycetes as absorbent for 
decolorization of effluent containing 
anthraquinone, phalocyanine and azo dyes 
(Zhou and Zimmerman, 1993). Algae are a 
potential biosorbent because of their 
availabilit y in both fresh and salt water. 
Algae have a capacity for biosorption due 
to their relativity high surface area and 
high binding affinity (Donmez and Aksu, 
2002). During algal biosorption, 
electrostatic attraction and complexation 
occur in the cell wall of algae (Satiroglu et 
al., 2002). Algae biosorbed some reactive 
dyes such as reactive yellow 22 by 
Spirogyra sp (Mohan et al., 2002). Based 
on the dye and the organisms used 
different binding rates and capacities were 
observed. Certain dyes have a specific 
affinity for binding with microbial species. 
Use of biomass has advantages, especially 
if the dye - containing effluent is very toxic 
(Table 4).  Adsorption by dead microbial cells  
Killed bacteria, yeast and fungi are used 
for the decolorization of dye  
containing 
effluents. The dyes from textile industries 
are varied from their chemistries and so 
their interactions with microorganisms 
depend on the chemistry of particular dye 
and microbial biomass (Polman and 
Brekenridge , 1996). Adsorption method is 
used during unfavourable conditions for 
the growth and preserves microbial 
population (Modak and Natarajan, 1995). 
Adsorption process by microorganism is 
carried out by ion exchange method. 
Bacterial cells adsorb reactive dyes (Hu, 
1992). The use of dead organisms instead 
live biomass overcomes the problem such 
as waste toxicity and requirement of 
nutrients. The dried form of R. arrhizus 
decolorize Remazol black B in aqueous 
solution (Asku and Tezer, 2000). Dead 
cells resulted in an effective adsorption 
than live cells due to increased surface 
area in gram negative cells and high lipid 
content in cell wall of Gram positive cells. 
Functional groups such as carboxyl, 
phosphonate, amine, hydroxyl group 
present in the cell wall of bacteria plays an 
important role in adsorption of dyes 
(Vander et al., 1997).  
Biodegradation of reactive dyes 
Fungal Biodegradation  
A group of fungal organisms have an 
ability to decolorize wide range of dyes 
(Fu and Viraraghavan, 2001 a,b). Fungus 
is capable of degrading dioxins, 
polychlorinated, biphenyls (PCBS) and 
chloro- organics (Reddy, 1995). White - rot 
fungi is capable of decolorizing dyes e.g., 
Coriolus versicolor (Sumathi and Manju, 
2001), Tramates versicolor (Wong and 
Yu, 1999 and Libra et al., 2003), Funalia 
trogii (Yesilada et al., 1995), Umbelopsis Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2014) 3(3): 421-436   
425 
isabellina and Penicillium geastrivous 
(Yang et al., 2003), Aspergillus foetidus, 
Rhizopus oryzae (Polman and 
Breckenridge, 1996) can decolorize or 
biosorb various dyes.  
Major group of fungus produce lignin 
modifying enzymes like laccase, 
manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin 
peroxidase (Lip) to mineralize/ degrade 
synthetic lignin or dyes (Raghukumar et 
al., 1996; Fu and Viraraghavan, 2001). 
The decolorization was a secondary 
metabolic activity linked to the fungus 
ligninolytic  
degradation activity. The 
degradation of some xenobiotic by other 
white- rot fungi is known to occur under 
non- ligninolytic conditions and would 
mainly be through the laccase enzyme 
activity (Dhawale et al., 1992)  
Basidiomycetes fungi not only decolorize 
but also degrade and mineralize a broad 
spectrum of different dye structure (Azo, 
anthroquinone, heterocyclic, 
triphenylmethane, and polymeric dyes) 
and it also degrade numerous toxic organic 
and recalcitrant compounds. The enzyme 
system of basidiomycetes fungi is non- 
specific in the degradation of pollutants 
and even acts on mixtures of pollutants. 
(Machado et al., 2005; Shah and Nerud, 
2002; Wesenberg et al., 2003).  
Bacterial degradation  
Work on  bacterial degradation of dyes 
were started in the 1970s with report on 
Bacillus subtilis (Horitsu  et al., 1977), 
then degradation was followed by 
numerous bacteria such as Aeromonas 
hydrophilia (Idaka and  Ogawa, 1978), 
Bacillus cereus (Wuhrmann et al., 1980), 
Pseudomonas sp (Kulla, 1981), E. Coli 
(Chang et al ., 2004). Under aerobic 
conditions azo dyes are not readily metabolized, intermediates formed during 
degradation resulted in disruption of 
metabolic pathways and the dyes were not 
mineralized. Whereas in anaerobic 
conditions, bacteria reduce azo dyes 
gratuitously by the activity of unspecific, 
soluble, cytoplasmic reductase called azo 
reductase. Azo reductase results in the 
production of colorless aromatic amines 
which may be toxic, mutagenic and 
carcinogenic to animals (Mcmulan et al., 
2001). Anaerobic to aerobic condition 
should be retaining to achieve a complete 
degradation. Different members of the 
consortium needed different conditions for 
optimum reaction and azo- based cleavage 
requires azo reductase, which function 
under anaerobic conditions (Haug et al., 
1991). Pseudomonas luteola have an 
ability to remove the color of reactive azo 
dyes (Hu, 1994).  
Algal Biodegradation  
Algal culture also has an ability to degrade 
azo dyes through azoreductase (Jinqi and 
Houtian, 1992). Chlorella and Oscillatoria 
were capable of degrading azo dyes to 
aromatic amines and further to simple 
organic compounds. Synechocystis sp and 
Phormidium sp have a capacity to remove 
reactive dyes such as Reactive Red, 
Remazol Blue, and Reactive Black B 
(Karacakaya et al., 2009).  
Yeast Biodegradation  
Limited amount of studies about yeast 
decolorization were reported. 
Kluyveromyces marxianus IMBS 
decolorize Remazol Back B dye of about 
98% (Meehan et al., 2000). Pseudozyma 
rugulosa Y -48 and Candida krusei G-1, 
are the yeast strains exhibited excellent 
color removal of reactive azo dyes.

effectively decolorize methyl red at 
different pH with involvement of 
azoreductase (Jadhav and Govindwar, 
2007) (Table 5).  
Aerobic/anaerobic degrada tion of 
reactive dyes   
Under aerobic conditions, bacteria 
produce an enzyme which helps to break 
down the organic compounds in waste 
water. Rhizopus oryzae, Cyathus  bulleri, 
Coriolus versicolor, Funalia trogii, 
Laetiporous sulphureus, Streptomyces sp., 
Trametes versicolor and other 
microorganisms decolorize dyes in aerobic 
conditions (Nigam et al., 2000; Salony et 
al., 2006; Zhang et al., 1999). Most of the 
dyes are recalcitrant for the biological 
degradation or nontransformable under 
aerobic conditions (Pagga and Brown, 
1986; Rai et al., 2005). Under anaerobic 
condition, the reactive dyes are 
decolorized effectively by using glucose as 
a carbon source (Carliell et al., 1996). 
Conventional sewage method under 
anaerobic condition decolorized reactive 
red 141. The reactive red 141 was 
decomposed under anaerobic condition by 
the cleavage of azo bond by the microbial 
community resulted in the formation of 2  
aminonaphthalene -1, 5 disulfonic acid 
(Carliell et al., 1995). The addition of salts 
such as nitrate and sulfate decolorized 
reactive red 141 under anaerobic 
condition. An anaerobic  
aerobic 
treatment process by mixed culture of 
bacterial isolated from textile dye effluent 
was used to decolorize the reactive azo 
dyes such as remazol brilliant orange 3R, 
remazol black B and remazol brilliant 
violet 5R (Supaka et al ., 2004). Treatment 
of synthetic dye waste water at the 
combination of anaerobic and aerobic 
conditions showed that the majority of colors are removed by the anaerobic 
process, whereas the chemical oxygen 
demand(COD) is removed by the aerobic 
process (Rajaguru et al., 2000 and Supaka 
et al., 2004). Mixture of bacterial isolates 
from domestic sewage treatment plant has 
been reported to be effective in 
decolorization of reactive azo dyes, red 
RB, blue M2B and yellow. The mixed 
cultures decolorize 95% of red RB and 
blue M2B. Decolorization remarkably 
enhance when peptone is used in the 
medium for growing the mixed culture 
(Vijaya et al., 2003).  
Enzymatic d egradation of reactive dyes  
Enzymes were used for decades in the 
textile industry as detergents, recently 
extracellular enzymes tested for their 
ability to decolor and degrade dyes 
(Gianfreda and Rao, 2004). To degrade 
dyes in a waste water plant, the 
chromophore in the dyes should be 
oxidized and cleaved. Laccase and 
manganese peroxidase are quite effective 
in dye degradation. Laccase from various 
fungi such as Trametes versicolor, 
Trametes hirsute, Pleurotus ostreatus and 
Phlebia tremellosa are found to be 
effective decolorizer for a wide variety of 
structurally different dye (Kandelbauer et 
al., 2004). Manganese peroxidase decolors 
Reactive orange 16, Remazol Brilliant 
Blue R, Drimaren Blue, Acid Black and 
Drimaren Red (Novonty et al., 2004) 
(Table 6).  
Manganese peroxidase from 
Phanerocheate chrysosporium decolorized 
reactive azo dyes such as reactive blue38, 
reactive violet 5, reactive black 5, reactive 
orange 96, reactive red 198 and reactive 
blue 15, whereas Bjerkandara adjusta

Discharge of effluent into water bodies are 
serious environmental problem. Reactive 
dyes are azo based dyes and they are 
recalcitrant to degrade by conventional 
treatment method. The biological 
treatment is an effective and alternate 
method to decolorize and mineralize the 
dyes in effluent without leaving harmful 
byproducts. In biological treatment the 
microorganisms biosorb/degrade the dyes 
with the help of some enzymes such as 
laccase, lignin peroxidase, manganese 
peroxidase etc. Both anaerobic and aerobic 
condition is required for complete 
degradation of reactive dyes.
