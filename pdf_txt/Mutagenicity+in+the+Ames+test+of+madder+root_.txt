Abstract 
Within an EU-funded research project, 281 textile dye products in use at 9 textile finishing 
companies from 8 European countries were assessed for potential mutagenic properties. 
Most of the dyes belonged to the so-called existing substances. Data sources considered 
were data published in the literature, unpublished industrial data provided by dye producing 
companies and laboratory testing. Data on mutagenicity are virtually absent for many of the 
dyes. Unpublished test results performed on behalf of the dye manufacturing industry proved 
to be an important data source, which is not accessible under usual circumstances. Four dye 
stuffs contained in seven dye products in use at the textile finishing companies were judged 
to be mutagenic based on published data from literature. Mutagenicity testing using 
Salmonella typhimurium , strains TA98 and TA100, revealed positive results for about 28% 
(15 out of 53) of the dye products investigated. Upon further testing with the mouse 
lymphoma assay (L5178Y/TK+/-) 67% (6 out of 9) of Ames-positive dyes proved to be 
mutagenic in this mammalian cell test. All data sources combined led to an overall 
assessment as being mutagenic for 14 dye products out of 281. For 16 there is a suspicion 
of mutagenicity due to positive responses in one test. Still, 71 of the dye products are without 
any data on mutagenicity. This paper describes the data aggregation process, evaluation 
criteria, the overall assessment, and exemplifies controversial evaluations. 
Introduction 
Possible genotoxic effects of textile dyes are most often discussed with respect to selected 
azo dyes (Platzek, 1996). Some of these dyes, which contain an azo group (-N=N-), are able 
to split off genotoxic and carcinogenic amines (e.g. Acid Red 85, which releases benzidine). 
The use of these dyes has been drastically reduced in Europe due to national regulations  
Schneider, Hafner, Jäger: Mutagenicity of textile dye products page 2 
reprint Journal of Applied Toxicology 24, 83-91 (2004) [ www.interscience.wiley.com ] (e.g. by the German Food and Commodities Act; similar regulations exist in the Netherlands 
and France) and textile quality labels (EU flower, Oeko-Tex Standard 100), but may still be a 
problem in non-European countries.  
Whereas hazards resulting from these azo dyes, which give rise to carcinogenic amines, are 
recognized and controlled, this is not the case for textile dyes in general. In a modified Ames 
test with fabric tested in situ (“Ames spot test”), 9.2% of 196 tested textile samples showed 
mutagenic effects in TA98 and/or TA100 (Knasmüller et al., 1993). Currently, there are 
several thousand textile dyes from various chemical classes in use in Europe. Most of them 
belong to the so-called existing substances, which have been placed on the European 
market before an effective chemical regulation has been installed in 1983. Toxicological data 
are often scarce for these substances.  
In a recent research project, funded within the Fifth Framework Programme of the EU, 
research institutions collaborated with nine small and medium-sized textile finishing 
companies (TFCs) from eight European countries to investigate the textile dyes currently in 
use within these companies. 
The aims of the project were 
• to check whether sufficient data are available to assess possible genotoxic properties 
of textile dyes 
• to investigate whether genotoxicity is a problem by using data from all sources 
including own laboratory tests 
• to substitute textile dyes identified as having genotoxic properties from the textile 
finishing process. 
This paper describes the type and amount of data used for the assessment, the overall 
results for the textile dyes scrutinized and problems encountered during the evaluation 
process. 
 
Methods  
Literature search and data organisation  
Relevant publications were retrieved using CI (colour index) names and CAS registry 
numbers extracted from safety data sheets and/or provided by the dye producing companies 
(DPCs). Data were retrieved from the literature by searching in databases (Medline, Toxline) 
as well as via internet to locate other relevant sources. ChemID was used to chemically 
identify dye stuffs (see figure 1 for the relations between various data sources). In addition to 
these sources, DPCs were asked for unpublished genotoxicity test results. As dyes can be 
contained in various products (from one or several DPCs) and test results were available for 
both ready-to-use products and for individual dye ingredients, this complex matrix of data has 
been captured and organized in a newly established relational database (MUTATEX, 
platform Microsoft ACCESS®). The MUTATEX database allows connecting TFC-specific 
information (use patterns, consumption) with data on the formulated products (composition, 
genotoxicity data) and dye ingredients (chemical identification, genotoxicity data).

Dye samples were provided by the participating textile finishing companies as they are used 
for textile dyeing. 
Tests for reverse mutation in S. typhimurium  (Ames-Test) (Ames et al., 1973) were carried 
out following OECD TG 471 (1997) and EU Commission directive 2000/32/EC, B.13/14. In 
deviation of the guidelines mentioned above only the two S. typhimurium  strains TA98 and 
TA100 (Dr. B. N. Ames, Berkley, CA, USA.) were applied in the presence and absence of a 
metabolic activation system (S9 Moltox, Boone, NC, USA). These strains are commonly 
used for screening on mutagenicity because they indicate both frame shift (hisD3052 with 
TA98) and base pair (hisG46 with TA100) mutations. They are recommended in the DIN 
guideline 38415-4 for the testing of waste water. Experiments with unclear results were 
repeated in independent studies. A sample was evaluated as mutagenic, if there was more 
than a doubling of revertant colonies per plate in comparison to the control in at least one 
strain with or without the metabolic activation system and/or if a concentration-related 
increase occurred over the range tested. Additionally, the increase of the number of revertant 
colonies was checked statistically using the Wilcoxon rank sum test according to Mann & 
Whitney (Wahrendorf  et al., 1985). Testing was started with five concentrations between 0.5 
and 5,000 µg/plate. Additional tests were performed with smaller concentration steps. 
The Mouse Lymphoma Assay (MLA) was applied to dye stuffs which proved to be Ames 
positive. Tests using cell line L5178Y TK+/- Clone 3.7.2.C (obtained from Schering, Berlin, 
Germany) were performed in 96-well microtiter plates following OECD TG 476 (1997) and 
EU Commission directive 2000/32/EC, B.17. In a first test, five concentrations between 15.8 
and 5,000 µg/ml were tested. Further tests were performed with smaller concentration steps. 
The test was evaluated as valid if the cloning efficiency (CE2) was at least 10%. A sample 
was evaluated as positive if the mutant frequency was elevated to more than about 100 per 
106 surviving cells in comparison to the control in at least one concentration and if this 
increase was significant (one way ANOVA followed by Dunnett`s test). The test allows the 
differentiation of chromosome and gene mutations both by the determination of small and big 
colonies (Moore & Doerr 1990).

reprint Journal of Applied Toxicology 24, 83-91 (2004) [ www.interscience.wiley.com ] Evaluation criteria  
The evaluation of mutagenic properties follows the base-level requirements and the testing 
strategy of the EU Technical Guidance Document (TGD) (EC, 2003). Base-level testing 
requires two in vitro  assays, a bacterial test (usually reverse mutations in S. typhimurium ) 
and a mammalian cell genotoxicity test (MCGT). If available , in vivo  results are regarded as 
superior to in vitro  tests. In the TGD, an in vivo  test for unscheduled DNA synthesis is 
recommended in case of a positive result for gene mutations in an MCGT. In contrast, dye 
producers applied a micronucleus test in vivo  in most cases. Due to the fact that suitable in 
vivo assays for gene mutations are lacking, substances, which showed positive results in in 
vitro tests for gene mutations (e.g. mutations at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 
(HPRT) locus) but were negative in vivo  for clastogenicity (e.g. in a micronucleus assay) 
were assessed to be not mutagenic. But substantial uncertainty remains in these cases. 
 
Results  
Data sources and availability  
Two hundred eighty-one different textile dye products (ready-to-use products bought by the 
textile finishing companies (TFCs) from various dye producers) have been in use at the TFCs 
at the start of the project. Data on genotoxic effects of the dyes mainly stem from three 
different sources: published data, data provided by dye producers and results obtained by 
laboratory tests during the project (figure 1). At the start of the project, all major textile dye 
producing companies (DPCs) supplying dye products to the TFCs have been contacted. 
Exchange of data has been agreed with the dye producers. Only one DPC refused to 
cooperate and did not contribute data to  the project.

Schneider, Hafner, Jäger: Mutagenicity of textile dye products page 5 
reprint Journal of Applied Toxicology 24, 83-91 (2004) [ www.interscience.wiley.com ] The amount of genotoxicity data available from the DPCs differed substantially between 
companies. Whereas some dye producers had (some kind of) test results for up to 90% of 
their products (or dye components), others had basically none. While unpublished and 
therefore not peer-reviewed, the test results provided by the DPCs have been carried out 
according to the latest guidelines and are generally judged to be reliable. Compared to other 
sources (safety data sheets (SDS), publications) producers’ data were the most relevant in 
terms of quantity (figure 2). Still, no genotoxicity data were available for 98 dye products 
(35%) after capturing published data and unpublished test results provided by the producers. 
For about 22%, at least one test result was available but base-level requirements were not 
fulfilled. 
 
 
Assessment of mutagenicity using published data  
Using data from the literature, four textile dye components were judged to be 
mutagenic according to the assessment criteria described (table 2). These dyes were 
contained in seven different products from 5 producing companies.

Malachite green (MG, Basic Green 4), a triphenylmethane dye, is not only used for textile 
finishing but also as a fungicide in aquaculture and for other purposes. There is a substantial 
database on genotoxicity; nevertheless, its mutagenic potential is far from clear. MG gave 
contradictory results in previous Ames tests (Clemmensen et al., 1984; Yamaguchi, 1988; 
ETAD, 1988; Kaur et al., 1993a), but a recent test carried out according to OECD guideline 
471 showed no mutagenicity in TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102 with and without metabolic 
activation (Fessard et al., 1999). Positive results with gene mutation tests with E. coli and 
yeast have been reported by Combes and Haveland-Smith (1982). 
Fessard et al. (1999) also stated a negative result in an assay for mutations at the 
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) locus in Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells. Evaluation was restricted, however, due to severe cytotoxicity. According to the 
same authors, MG damaged DNA in a Comet assay with CHO cells. DNA strand breaks after 
alkaline elution have been reported by Mahudawala et al. (1999). MG inhibited DNA 
synthesis (Rao et al., 1995; 1998) and induced malignant transformation of mammalian cells 
in vitro  (Panandiker et al., 1993; Mahudawala et al., 1999). 
In vivo  mutagenicity tests revealed no mutagenic potential (micronucleus test with mice: 
Clemmensen et al., 1984; mouse spot test: Jensen, 1984). But a recent report by Culp et al. 
(1999) showed a dose-dependent increase of DNA adducts in the liver of mice and rats after 
28 days of feeding MG in concentrations up to 600 ppm. MG promoted pre-neoplastic lesions 
of the liver after induction with N-nitrosodiethylamine (Fernandes et al., 1991; Gupta et al., 
2003).  
Schneider, Hafner, Jäger: Mutagenicity of textile dye products page 7 
reprint Journal of Applied Toxicology 24, 83-91 (2004) [ www.interscience.wiley.com ] MG is currently under test for carcinogenicity within the US National Toxicology Program, 
and these studies will allow to better judge the relevance of the reported data. Up to that 
point, there remains concern with regard to a possible mutagenic potential of MG. 
Another dye listed in table 2 is an extract of plant roots (rubia tinctorum, madder roots, CI 
natural red 8). The major genotoxic constituent is regarded to be lucidin, a hydroxy-
anthraquinone constituent. Further investigations on mutagenic effects of madder root 
extracts and on the presence of lucidin at various stages of the dyeing process with Rubia 
tinctorum were performed and reported by Jäger et al. (2003a).  
 
Overall mutagenicity assessment  
After prioritizing according to consumption and technical importance for the TFCs, 
untested dye products were selected for testing. Fifteen out of 53 (28%) dye products tested 
proved to be positive in S. typhimurium , strains TA98 and/or TA100. Nine of these positive 
samples were further tested in the MLA and 6 (67%) gave positive results in this mammalian 
cell test (see Jäger et al., 2003b for more details).  
From these investigations, together with published and industrial data, the following picture 
emerges for the 281 textile dye products assessed (figure 3): 
• for 107 dye products (or dye components) base-level requirements are fulfilled and 
give no hint to mutagenic activity 
• for 73 products only one test is available with no indication of a mutagenic potential 
• for 16 products there is a positive test result in the only test existing or results from 
several tests led to contradictory results leaving suspicion of mutagenic activity 
• 14 dye products are assessed to have mutagenic activity 
• still, after substantial laboratory testing within this project, there are 71 dye products 
currently in use in the TFCs involved with genotoxicity data unknown or completely 
lacking.

data, test results provided by dye producing companies and own laboratory test

Importance of impurities  
With several of the tested products discrepancies could be observed between the results 
obtained in S. typhimurium  with the formulated product and the results reported by producers 
with the pure dye (technical grade). Whereas in general the formulated products used by the 
TFCs were tested, in the case of one dye product, Turquoise Cibacrone PGR (chemical 
nature and name of the dye contained unknown), a direct comparison between the technical 
pure1 and the formulated dye has been made in S. typhimurium.   
The formulated product showed a weak but significant mutagenic response in TA 98 with 
metabolic activation at the highest concentration tested (5000 µg/plate). In contrast, the 
technical grade pure dye was inactive in S. typhimurium  (figure 4), which is in agreement 
with the producer’s data. Upon further testing, the dye product also showed mutagenic 
effects in the mouse lymphoma assay with metabolic activation. It induced a statistically 
significant increase of small colonies, which is indicative for chromosomal mutations. At 2500 
µg/ml and higher, mutation frequency was more than threefold compared to controls (figure 
5).

constituent (technical grade) in S. typhimurium (TA98) with and without metabolic 
activation   
 
The different results in the Ames test with the technical grade dye and the formulated product 
might be due to mutagenic ingredients of the product others than the dye. Chemical 
interactions between constituents of the product leading to mutagenic reaction products are 
possible in principle, but not likely. 
 
Contradictory data  
In some cases available data were contradictory, leading to extensive discussions. 
This is exemplified with recent results on Lanaset and other dyes. Wollin and Görlitz 
(2002; 2003) published results on several textile dyes applying a bacterial assay 
(reverse mutation in S. typhimurium ), the Single Cell Gel (SCG)/Comet assay, and 
the in vitro  micronucleus assay and in part obtained results which deviated from 
industrial data (table 3). With the micronucleus assay, they used a non-validated test 
design with an immortalized human keratinocytes cell line (HaCaT) and for some of 
the dyes additionally natural human keratinocytes. All of the dyes tested gave 
positive results in this micronucleus assay in vitro and in the Comet assay. MCGT 
carried out with these substances on behalf of the dye manufacturers according to 
OECD guidelines or corresponding drafts (e.g. test for gene mutations (HPRT-locus 
in L5178Y cells) and test for chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary 
cells) showed no mutagenic response. Lanaset Yellow 2R was subjected by the 
DPCs to a micronucleus test in vitro  in L5178Y cells and gave a negative result. 
Reasons for these discrepancies might include an unusual susceptibility of the test 
using keratinocytes or difficulties in demonstrating mutagenic effects due to  
Schneider, Hafner, Jäger: Mutagenicity of textile dye products page 10 
reprint Journal of Applied Toxicology 24, 83-91 (2004) [ www.interscience.wiley.com ] overlapping cytotoxicity, for which there are some hints from testing the ingredients of 
Lanaset Yellow 2R. To clarify these discrepancies additional investigations should be 
carried out. With another dye containing Acid Black 220, the micronucleus test in 
vitro (L5178Y) gave a positive result (in agreement with the results obtained with 
keratinocytes) but a subsequent micronucleus test in vivo  was negative.

reprint of Journal of Applied Toxicology 24, 83-91 (2004) [ www.interscience.wiley.com ] Discussion 
This examination of available data on genotoxicity of textile dyes revealed substantial data 
gaps for a lot of these substances. Unpublished test results of the dye manufacturers 
emerged as an important data source, but substantial differences between DPCs became 
obvious: Voluntary testing of products or ingredients is common with some but not with other 
companies. Due to a well established cooperation between the TFCs, the DPCs, and the 
research institutions assessing the dyes within this EU research project, these data were 
made available for an overall assessment. Outside this research framework data are 
provided by DPCs only upon request to their customers. But textile finishing companies do 
not have the expertise to ask for these data, let alone to make proper use of it. Therefore, a 
data exchange and evaluation process leading to increased use of thoroughly tested and 
non-mutagenic textile dyes can only be envisioned if awareness within the textile production 
chain is increased. The situation might change after implementation of the new European 
Union chemicals regulation, which will not differentiate any more between new and existing 
substances (EU White Paper on the Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy; EC, 2001). 
The evaluation performed indicates that dyes with potential mutagenic effects are in use in 
the textile finishing industry. Fourteen out of the 281 dye products included proved to have 
mutagenic potential according to the assessment criteria applied. Of the dye products tested 
in the S. typhimurium test within the project, 28% gave positive results in TA98 and/or 
TA100, and about 67% of the Ames-positive dyes tested in the MLA proved to be mutagenic 
in this mammalian cell assay. Using these numbers to predict the chance to find mutagenic 
samples within the 71 dye products without test results and within the 14 dyes suspicious to 
be mutagenic due to positive results from the first test about 15 to 20 additional potentially 
genotoxic substances can be expected. This sums up to more than 10% of the textile dyes 
showing mutagenic activity. Whereas these numbers are only insufficient attempts to quantify 
the unknown, it gives an idea of the dimension of the problem.  
In agreement with Knasmüller et al. (1993) it can be concluded from our results that 
mutagenic effects of poorly investigated textile dyes pose a problem. These authors 
investigated textile samples in situ  in the Ames test and found more than 9% of the samples 
showing positive results. Discussion of genotoxic substances on textiles in recent years 
focused on azo dyes splitting off carcinogenic amines. And indeed, recent investigations 
state that these dyes can still be found on fabric (Yassini et al., 1997; Danish EPA, 1998; 
Zeilmaker et al., 1999). The participating TFCs banned these hazardous azo dyes already 
years ago from their production process. But these azo dyes may be a problem especially 
with textile products imported to Europe (Lokhande and Naik, 1996). Since none of the dye 
stuffs considered here belongs to this group it must be stated that there are other textile dyes 
which may give rise to mutagenic effects.  
As the project was concerned with both occupational safety during the textile finishing 
process and with consumer protection, leachability of hazardous dyes from clothes was not 
addressed in the first place. It can be expected that at least for some chemical classes as, 
e.g. reactive dyes, exposure of consumers is low. But as shown e.g. by Knasmüller et al. 
(1993) with the Ames spot test, a relevant proportion of dyes (9.2%), which are active in S. 
typhimurium , is leachable from textile samples. This was confirmed by own results with the 
Ames spot test using 92 textile and yarn samples from the TFCs. About 5.4% of all samples 
tested were positive in this rather insensitive test with TA98 (Jäger et al., 2003c).  
Schneider, Hafner, Jäger: Mutagenicity of textile dye products page 13 
reprint Journal of Applied Toxicology 24, 83-91 (2004) [ www.interscience.wiley.com ] As far as the chemical nature of the dyes was revealed, no chemical class of dyes was 
particularly represented in the group of potentially hazardous dyes. So, membership in 
chemical classes and structure-activity relationships are of limited value to pre-select 
potential mutagenic dyes.  
Using the communication established during the project, the TFCs involved are working to 
eliminate the mutagenic dyes identified from their production process. Problems encountered 
vary with the type of dye, with differing substrates and with the price of alternative products 
(Jäger et al., 2003c). Preliminary results from this  substitution process show that textile 
dyeing avoiding these dyes is feasible.
