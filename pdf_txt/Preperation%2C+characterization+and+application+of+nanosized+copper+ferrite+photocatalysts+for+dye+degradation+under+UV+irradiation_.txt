Nanosized copper ferrite-type materials (Cu xFe3exO4,0/C20x/C201) have been prepared by combination of
co-precipitation and mechanochemical activation and/or thermal treatment. The crystalline structure
and morphology of the obtained ferrite nanopowders have been characterized by different instrumentalmethods, such as Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), M €ossbauer and FT-IR spectroscopies, speci ﬁc surface
area and porosity measurements, thermal analyses (Differential Thermal Analysis and Thermogravi-
metric Analysis) and Temperature-Programmed Reduction. The average crystallite size of copper ferritesranged between 7.8 and 14.7 nm and show a superparamagnetic and collective magnetic excitationsnature. The photocatalytic decolorization of Malachite green oxalate under different UV illumination
intervals was examined using these copper ferrites as photocatalysts. The results indicate that the pre-
pared nanostructured copper ferrites showed enhanced photocatalytic activity and amount adsorbedMalachite Green dye. The co-precipitated nanosized copper ferrite powder with a low content of copper
metal ions in a magnetite host structure (Cu
0.25Fe2.75O4) showed an apparent pseudo- ﬁrst-order rate
constant 15.4 /C210/C03min/C01and an amount adsorbed Malachite Green as model organic dye pollutant per

suitable for photocatalytic treatment of wastewaters containing organic dyes. The new aspect of

1. Introduction
The Cu eFeeO system is of long-standing interest in solid-state
physics, mineralogy, ceramics and metallurgy [1,2] . Copper ferrite
(CuFe 2O4) is one of the most important spinel ferrites because it
exhibits phase transitions, changing semiconducting properties,
shows electrical switching and tetragonality variation when treated
under different conditions in addition to interesting magnetic and
electrical properties with chemical and thermal stabilities. It is used
in a wide range of applications in gas sensing, catalytic applications,
Li ion batteries, high density magneto-optic recording devices,
color imaging, bioprocessing, magnetic refrigeration and ferro ﬂuids
[3e5].
A copper ferrite can be formulated as (Cu2þ)[Fe3þ
2]O4where
Cu2þand Fe3þoccupy tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) positions
of the FCC lattice formed by O2/C0ions. This ferrite is generally rep-
resented by the (Cu2þ)1-x(Fe3þ)x[(Cu2þ)x(Fe3þ)2-x]O2/C0
4formula
where the ions within the brackets occupy the B sites and the ions
outside the bracket occupy the A sites. Ideal copper ferrite adopts
an inverse spinel structure (x ¼1) with 8 Cu2þions in B sites and 16
Fe3þions equally distributed between A and B sites per unit cell (32
oxygen ions) [6].
The preparation method plays a very important role with regard
to the chemical, structural and magnetic properties of the spinel
ferrites [7,8] . Copper ferrite materials can be produced by various
procedures, such as sonochemical method [9], ceramic method
[2,10] , hydrothermal route [3]or hydrothermal route coupled with
a reverse micelle method [11], solid state reactions [12e15], co-
precipitation [14e18], solegel[14], auto-combustion method [19],
microwave-induced combustion process [20], electrospinning
method [4], soft chemical methods ea complexation method and a
self-propagating combustion [8], citric acid-aided process [15], etc.
In this study we report the synthesis of nanosized copper ferrite
materials Cu xFe3exO4,0/C20x/C201 with different stoichiometries,
their physicochemical characterization and their application in
photocatalytic reaction. The phase composition and structural
properties of the prepared copper ferrites were established using
different physicochemical methods. Application of these nano-
dimensional copper ferrite materials as potential photocatalysts for
puriﬁcation of water polluted by organic dyes is also reported; we
used degradation of Malachite green oxalate dye in water under UV
light as a test reaction. The relationships between synthesis con-
ditions, structure, and photocatalytic properties are also discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of nanosized copper ferrite materials
Different series of copper ferrite materials were prepared using
FeCl 2$4H2O (Sigma Aldrich, p.a.), FeCl 3$6H2O (P.P.H. “STANLAB ”s.j)
and CuCl 2$2H2O (Valerus, p.a.) as the starting reagents, which were
dissolved in distilled water to prepare 0.03 M solutions. These were
mixed in 3:8:1, 1:4:1 and 0:2:1 volume ratios to produce samples A
eCu0.25Fe2.75O4,BeCu0.5Fe2.5O4andCeCuFe 2O4, respectively. A0.3 M solution of NaOH was used as precipitating agent, and slowly
dropwise added to the solutions containing the metal salts, which
were being vigorously stirred, until a constant pH value of 12.5 was
reached. The suspensions were further stirred for 1 h at room
temperature. The obtained dark brown precipitates were centri-
fuged and washed several times with distilled water until pH ¼7.
After drying at 40/C14C for 24 h the three samples were thermally
treated at 300/C14C for 3 h in argon, nitrogen or air, respectively
yielding samples D,E, and F; the thermal treatment was performed
in a furnace from Carbolite type MTF-12/38/400, England. An
additional sample was prepared from sample C by milling 2.08 g of
the solid using a milling container with volume 50 ml for 1 h at
200 rpm and a C/balls mass ratio of 1/20 in a high energy planetary
ball mill type PM 100, Retsch, Germany. After mechanochemical
activation, the solid was thermally treated at 400/C14C for 4 h in air,
yielding sample G.
2.2. Physicochemical characterization of synthesized
nanodimensional copper ferrite materials
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) diagrams of the prepared
copper ferrite materials were recorded in a TUR M62 apparatus
equipped with a HZG-4 goniometer, PC management and data
accumulation, using CoK aradiation. JCPDS database (Powder
Diffraction Files, Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards,Philadelphia PA, USA, 1997) was used for the phase determination.
The average crystallite size, lattice microstrain parameter and
unit cell parameter of synthesized copper ferrite phases was
calculated by the Scherrer [21] and Williamson eHall equations
[22,23] using PowderCell program:

gation, Bthe Scherrer constant (0.89), lthe wavelength of X-ray

M€ossbauer spectra were taken at a constant acceleration mode
on a Wissenschaftliche Elektronik GmbH apparatus, working with
57Co/Cr source and a-Fe standard. The parameters of hyper ﬁne
interactions of M €ossbauer spectral components, isomer shift (IS),
quadrupole splitting (QS), hyper ﬁne effective magnetic ﬁeld in the
site of iron nuclei (H eff), line widths (FW) and component relative
weights (G), were established by computer ﬁtting.
The nitrogen adsorption edesorption isotherms for speci ﬁc
surface area and porosity assessment were recorded in a Gemini VII
2390T Surface Area Analyzer from Micromeritics; the samples had
been previously degassed in a Flow Prep 060 degassing unit, alsoK. Zaharieva et al. / Materials Chemistry and Physics xxx (2015) 1 e8 2
