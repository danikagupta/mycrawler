 IARC MONOGRAPHS 
In 1969, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) initiated a programme on the evaluation of the 
carcinogenic risk of chemicals to humans involving the production of critically evaluated monographs on individual chemicals. The programme was subsequently expanded to include evaluations of carcinogenic risks associated with 
exposures to complex mixtures, lifestyle factors and biologi cal and physical agents, as well as those in specific 
occupations. The objective of the programm e is to elaborate and publish in the fo rm of monographs critical reviews of 
data on carcinogenicity for agents to which humans are known to be exposed and on specific exposure situations; to 
evaluate these data in terms of human risk with the help of international wo rking groups of experts in chemical 
carcinogenesis and related fields; and to indicate where a dditional research efforts are needed. The lists of IARC 
evaluations are regularly updated and are availabl e on the Internet at ht tp://monographs.iarc.fr/. 
This programme has been supported since 1982 by Cooperative Agreement U01 CA33193 with the United 
States National Cancer Institute, Depa rtment of Health and Human Services . Additional support has been provided 
since 1986 by the Health, Safety and Hygiene at Work Unit of the European Commission Directorate-General for 
Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, and since 1992 by the United States National Institute of 
Environmental Health Sciences, Department of Health and Human Services. The contents of this volume are solely

NOTE TO THE READER 
 
The term ‘carcinogenic risk’ in the IARC Monographs  series is taken to mean that an 
agent is capable of causing cancer  under some circumstances. The Monographs  evaluate 
cancer hazards, despite the historical pres ence of the word ‘ris ks’ in the title. 
Inclusion of an agent in the Monographs  does not imply that it is a carcinogen, only 
that the published data have been examined. Equally, the fact that an agent has not yet been evaluated in a Monograph  does not mean that it is not carcinogenic. 
The evaluations of carcinogenic risk are made by international working groups of 
independent scientists and are qualitative in nature. No recommendation is given for regulation or legislation. 
Anyone who is aware of published data that  may alter the evaluation of the carcino-
genic risk of an agent to humans is encouraged to make this information available to the Section of IARC Monographs, International Agency for Research on Cancer, 150 cours 
Albert Thomas, 69372 Lyon Cedex 08, France, in  order that the agent may be considered 
for re-evaluation by a future Working Group. 
Although every effort is made to prepar e the monographs as accurately as possible, 
mistakes may occur. Readers are requested to communicate any errors to the Section of 
IARC Monographs, so that corrections can be reported in future volumes.

–9– IARC MONOGRAPHS ON THE EVALUATION OF 
CARCINOGENIC RISKS TO HUMANS 
PREAMBLE 
The Preamble to the IARC Monographs  describes the objective and scope of 
the programme, the scientific principles and procedures used in developing a 
Monograph , the types of evidence considered an d the scientific criteria that guide 
the evaluations. The Preamble should be consulted when reading a Monograph  or 
list of evaluations.  
A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES  
1. Background  
Soon after IARC was established in 1965, it  received frequent re quests for advice on 
the carcinogenic risk of chemicals, includi ng requests for lists of known and suspected 
human carcinogens. It was clear that it w ould not be a simple task to summarize 
adequately the complexity of  the information that was available, and IARC began to 
consider means of obtaining international expe rt opinion on this topic. In 1970, the IARC 
Advisory Committee on Environmental Ca rcinogenesis recommended ‘...that a 
compendium on carcinogenic chemicals be prep ared by experts. Th e biological activity 
and evaluation of practical importance to public health should be referenced and 
documented.’ The IARC Governing Council adopted a resolution concerning the role of 
IARC in providing government authorities with expert, independent, scientific opinion on 
environmental carcinogenesis. As one mean s to that end, the Governing Council 
recommended that IARC should prepare monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic 
risk of chemicals to man, which b ecame the initial title of the series.  
In the succeeding years, the scope  of the programme broadened as Monographs  were 
developed for groups of related chemicals, complex mixtures, occupational exposures, 
physical and biological agents and lifestyle factors. In 1988,  the phrase ‘of chemicals’ was 
dropped from the title, wh ich assumed its present form, IARC Monographs on the 
Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans . 
Through the Monographs  programme, IARC seeks to id entify the causes of human 
cancer. This is the first step in cancer preven tion, which is needed as much today as when 10 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 IARC was established. The global burden of cancer  is high and continues to increase: the 
annual number of new cases was estimated at 10.1 million in 2000 and is expected to 
reach 15 million by 2020 (S tewart & Kleihues, 2003). With current trends in 
demographics and exposure, the cancer burden has been shifting from high-resource 
countries to low- and medium-resource countries. As a result of Monographs  evaluations, 
national health agencies have been able, on sc ientific grounds, to ta ke measures to reduce 
human exposure to carcinogens in th e workplace and in the environment.  
The criteria established in 1971 to eval uate carcinogenic risks to humans were 
adopted by the Working Groups whose deliberations resulted in the first 16 volumes of 
the Monographs  series. Those criteria were subsequently updated by further ad-hoc 
Advisory Groups (IARC, 1977, 1978, 1979,  1982, 1983, 1987, 1988, 1991; Vainio et al. , 
1992; IARC, 2005, 2006).  
The Preamble is primarily a statement of scientific principles, rather than a 
specification of working pro cedures. The procedures thro ugh which a Working Group 
implements these principles are not specified in detail. They usually involve operations 
that have been established as being effective during previous Monograph  meetings but 
remain, predominantly, the prerogat ive of each indivi dual Working Group.  
2. Objective and scope  
The objective of the programme is to prepare, with the help of international Working 
Groups of experts, and to publish in the form of Monographs , critical reviews and 
evaluations of evidence on the carcinogenicity of a wide rang e of human exposures. The 
Monographs  represent the first step in carcinogen risk assessment, which involves 
examination of all relevant information in  order to assess the strength of the available 
evidence that an agent could alter the age-sp ecific incidence of cancer in humans. The 
Monographs  may also indicate where additional resear ch efforts are need ed, specifically 
when data immediately relevant to an evaluation are not available.  
In this Preamble, the term ‘agent’ refers to any entity or circumstance that is subject to 
evaluation in a Monograph . As the scope of the programme has broadened, categories of 
agents now include specific ch emicals, groups of related chemicals, complex mixtures, 
occupational or environmental exposures, cult ural or behavioural practices, biological 
organisms and physical agents. This list of  categories may expand as causation of, and 
susceptibility to, malignant disease be come more fully understood. 
A cancer ‘hazard’ is an agent that is capable of causing cancer under some 
circumstances, while a cancer ‘risk’ is an est imate of the carcinogenic effects expected 
from exposure to a cancer hazard. The Monographs  are an exercise in evaluating cancer 
hazards, despite the historical presence of the word ‘risks’ in the ti tle. The distinction 
between hazard and risk is important, and the Monographs  identify cancer  hazards even 
when risks are very low at current expos ure levels, because new uses or unforeseen 
exposures could engender risks that are significantly higher.   PREAMBLE 11  
 In the Monographs , an agent is termed ‘carcinogenic’ if it is capable of increasing the 
incidence of malignant neoplasms, reducing th eir latency, or increasing their severity or 
multiplicity. The induction of benign neoplasm s may in some circumstances (see Part B, 
Section 3a) contribute to the judgement th at the agent is carcinogenic. The terms 
‘neoplasm’ and ‘tumour’ are used interchangeably. 
The Preamble continues the previous usage of  the phrase ‘strength of evidence’ as a 
matter of historical continuity, although it should be understood that Monographs  
evaluations consider studies that support a fi nding of a cancer hazard  as well as studies 
that do not. 
Some epidemiological and experimental stud ies indicate that different agents may act 
at different stages in the car cinogenic process, and several different mechanisms may be 
involved. The aim of the Monographs  has been, from their incepti on, to evaluate evidence 
of carcinogenicity at any stage in the car cinogenesis process, independently of the 
underlying mechanisms. Information on mechanisms may, however, be used in making the overall evaluation  (IARC, 1991; Vainio et al. , 1992; IARC, 2005, 2006; see also 
Part B, Sections 4 and 6). As mechanisms  of carcinogenesis are elucidated, IARC 
convenes international scien tific conferences to determ ine whether a broad-based 
consensus has emerged on how specific mechanis tic data can be used in an evaluation of 
human carcinogenicity. The results of such co nferences are reported in IARC Scientific 
Publications, which, as long as they still reflect  the current state of scientific knowledge, 
may guide subsequent Working Groups.  
Although the Monographs  have emphasized hazard identi fication, important issues 
may also involve dose–response assessment. In many cases, the same epidemiological 
and experimental studies used to evaluate a cancer hazard can also be used to estimate a 
dose–response relationship. A Monograph  may undertake to estimate dose–response 
relationships within the range of the available epidemiological data, or it may compare the 
dose–response information from experimental and epidemiological studies. In some 
cases, a subsequent publication may be prep ared by a separate Working Group with 
expertise in quantitative dose–response assessment.  
The Monographs  are used by national and international authorities to make risk 
assessments, formulate decisions concerning preventive measures, provide effective 
cancer control programmes and decide among alternative options for public health 
decisions. The evaluations of IARC Working Groups are scientific, qualitative 
judgements on the evidence for or against carci nogenicity provided by the available data. 
These evaluations represent only one part of  the body of information on which public 
health decisions may be based. Public health options vary from one situation to another 
and from country to country and relate to many factors, including different socioeconomic 
and national priorities. Therefore, no recommendation is given with regard to regulation or legislation, which are the responsibi lity of individual governments or other 
international organizations.  12 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 3. Selection of agents for review  
Agents are selected for review on the basis of two main criteria: (a) there is evidence 
of human exposure and (b) there is some evidence or suspicion of carcinogenicity. Mixed 
exposures may occur in occupational and environmental setting s and as a result of 
individual and cultural habits (such as t obacco smoking and dietary practices). Chemical 
analogues and compounds with biological or ph ysical characteristics similar to those of 
suspected carcinogens may also be considered, even in the absence of data on a possible 
carcinogenic effect in humans or experimental animals.  
The scientific literature is surveyed for pu blished data relevant to an assessment of 
carcinogenicity. Ad-hoc Advisory Groups conv ened by IARC in 1984, 1989, 1991, 1993, 
1998 and 2003 made recommenda tions as to which agents should be evaluated in the 
Monographs  series. Recent recommendations are available on the Monographs  
programme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr). IARC may schedule other agents for 
review as it becomes aware of new scientific information or as nati onal health agencies 
identify an urgent public health need related to cancer.  
As significant new data become available on an agent for which a Monograph  exists, 
a re-evaluation may be made at a subsequent meeting, and a new Monograph  published. 
In some cases it may be appropriate to revi ew only the data pub lished since a prior 
evaluation. This can be useful for updating a database, reviewing new data to resolve a 
previously open question or id entifying new tumour sites associated with a carcinogenic 
agent. Major changes in an  evaluation (e.g. a new classi fication in Group 1 or a 
determination that a mechanism does not opera te in humans, see Part B, Section 6) are 
more appropriately addressed by a full review.  
4. Data for the Monographs 
Each Monograph  reviews all pertinent epidemiologi cal studies and cancer bioassays 
in experimental animals. Those judged inadequate or irrelevant to the evaluation may be 
cited but not summarized. If a group of simila r studies is not reviewed, the reasons are 
indicated.  
Mechanistic and other relevant data are also reviewed. A Monograph  does not 
necessarily cite all the mechanistic literature concerning the agent being evaluated (see 
Part B, Section 4). Only those data considered by the Working Group to be relevant to 
making the evaluation are included.  
With regard to epidemiological studies, can cer bioassays, and mechanistic and other 
relevant data, only reports that have been  published or accepted fo r publication in the 
openly available scientific literature are reviewed. The same publication requirement applies to studies originating from IARC, in cluding meta-analyses or pooled analyses 
commissioned by IARC in advance of a meeting (see Part B, Section 2c). Data from 
government agency reports that are publicly available are also cons idered. Excep tionally,  PREAMBLE 13  
 doctoral theses and other material that are in  their final form and publicly available may 
be reviewed. 
Exposure data and other information on an agent under consideration are also 
reviewed. In the sections on ch emical and physical properties,  on analysis, on production 
and use and on occurrence, published and unpublished sources of information may be considered.  
Inclusion of a study does not imply acceptance of the adequacy of the study design or 
of the analysis and interpretation of the resu lts, and limitations are clearly outlined in 
square brackets at the end of each study d escription (see Part B). The reasons for not 
giving further consideration to an individual study also are indicated in the square 
brackets.  
5. Meeting participants  
Five categories of partic ipant can be present at Monograph  meetings.  
(a) The Working Group is responsible for the critical reviews and evaluations that are 
developed during the meeting. The tasks of Working Group Members are: (i) to ascertain 
that all appropriate data have been collected ; (ii) to select the data relevant for the 
evaluation on the basis of sc ientific merit; (iii) to prepar e accurate summaries of the data 
to enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Working Group; (iv) to evaluate the 
results of epidemiological and experimental  studies on cancer; (v) to evaluate data 
relevant to the understanding of mechanisms of carcinogenesis; and (vi) to make an overall evaluation of the carcinogenicity of the exposure to humans. Working Group 
Members generally have published significant research related to the carcinogenicity of 
the agents being reviewed, and IARC uses literature searches to identify most experts. Working Group Members are selected on the basis of (a) knowledge and experience and 
(b) absence of real or apparent conflicts of interests. Consideration is also given to 
demographic diversity and balance of scientific findings and views.  
(b) Invited Specialists are experts who also  have critical knowledge and experience 
but have a real or apparent conflict of interests. These experts are invited when necessary 
to assist in the Working Group by contribu ting their unique k nowledge and experience 
during subgroup and plenary discussions. They may also contribute text on non-
influential issues in the section on exposure, such as a general description of data on 
production and use (see Part B, Section 1). Invited Specialists do not serve as meeting 
chair or subgroup chair, draft text that pert ains to the description or interpretation of 
cancer data, or participate in the evaluations.  
(c) Representatives of national and inte rnational health agencies often attend 
meetings because their agencies sponsor the prog ramme or are interested in the subject of 
a meeting. Representatives do not serve as meeti ng chair or subgroup chair, draft any part 
of a Monograph,  or participate in the evaluations.  
(d) Observers with relevant scientific credentials may be admitted to a meeting by 
IARC in limited numbers. Attention will be given to achieving a balance of Observers 14 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 from constituencies with differi ng perspectives. They are invited to observe the meeting 
and should not attempt to influence it. Ob servers do not serve as meeting chair or 
subgroup chair, draft any part of a Monograph , or participate in th e evaluations. At the 
meeting, the meeting chair and subgroup chairs may grant Observers an opportunity to 
speak, generally after they have observed a discussion. Observers agree to respect the 
Guidelines for Observers at IARC Monographs  meetings (available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr).  
(e) The IARC Secretariat consists of sci entists who are designated by IARC and who 
have relevant expertise. They serve as rapporte urs and participate in all discussions. When 
requested by the meeting chair or subgroup ch air, they may also draft text or prepare 
tables and analyses.  
Before an invitation is extended, each po tential participant, including the IARC 
Secretariat, completes the WHO Declaration of  Interests to report financial interests, 
employment and consulting, and individual an d institutional research support related to 
the subject of the meeting. IARC assesses these in terests to determine whether there is a 
conflict that warrants some limitation on par ticipation. The declarations are updated and 
reviewed again at the opening of the meeti ng. Interests related to the subject of the 
meeting are disclosed to the meeting participants and in the published volume (Cogliano 
et al. , 2004).  
The names and principal affiliations of participants are available on the Monographs  
programme website (http://monographs.iarc.f r) approximately two months before each 
meeting. It is not acceptable for Observers or  third parties to cont act other participants 
before a meeting or to lobby them at any time.  Meeting participants are asked to report all 
such contacts to IARC (Cogliano et al. , 2005).  
All participants are listed, with their prin cipal affiliations, at the beginning of each 
volume. Each participant who is a Member of a Working Group serves as an individual scientist and not as a representative of any organization, government or industry.  
6. Working procedures  
A separate Working Group is responsible for developing each volume of 
Monographs . A volume contains one or more Monographs , which can cover either a 
single agent or several related agents. Approx imately one year in advance of the meeting 
of a Working Group, the agents to be reviewed are announced on the Monographs  
programme website (http://monographs.iarc. fr) and participants are selected by IARC 
staff in consultation with other experts.  Subsequently, relevant biological and 
epidemiological data are collected by IARC from recognized sources of information on 
carcinogenesis, including data storage and retrieval systems such as PubMed. Meeting 
participants who are asked to prepare prelim inary working papers for specific sections are 
expected to supplement the IARC litera ture searches with their own searches.  
For most chemicals and some complex mixtures, the major collection of data and the 
preparation of working papers for the sections  on chemical and physical properties, on  PREAMBLE 15  
 analysis, on production and use, and on occurrence are carried out under a separate 
contract funded by  the US National Cancer  Institute. Industrial associations, labour unions 
and other knowledgeable organizations may be asked to provide input to the sections on 
production and use, although this involv ement is not required as a general rule. 
Information on production and trade is obtained from governmental, trade and market research publications and, in some cases, by direct contact with industries. Separate 
production data on some agents may not be available for a variety of reasons (e.g. not 
collected or made public in all producing countries, production is small). Information on uses may be obtained from published sources bu t is often complemented by direct contact 
with manufacturers. Efforts are made to supple ment this information with data from other 
national and international sources.  
Six months before the meeting, the material obtained is sent to meeting participants to 
prepare preliminary working papers. The work ing papers are compiled by IARC staff and 
sent, prior to the meeting, to Working Group Members and Invited Specialists for review.  
The Working Group meets at IARC for seven to  eight days to discuss and finalize the 
texts and to formulate the evaluations. The ob jectives of the meeting are peer review and 
consensus. During the first few days, four subgroups (covering exposure data, cancer in 
humans, cancer in experimental animals, and mechanistic and other relevant data) review 
the working papers, develop a joint subgroup draft and write summaries. Care is taken to 
ensure that each study summary is written or reviewed by someone not associated with the study being considered. During the last few days, the Working Group meets in 
plenary session to review the su bgroup drafts and develop the evaluations. As a result, the 
entire volume is the joint product of the Working Group, and there are no individually authored sections.  
IARC Working Groups strive to achieve a consensus evaluation. Consensus reflects 
broad agreement among Work ing Group Members, but not  necessarily unanimity. The 
chair may elect to poll Working Group Members to determine the diversity of scientific 
opinion on issues where consen sus is not readily apparent.  
After the meeting, the master copy is verified by consulting the original literature, 
edited and prepared for publication. The aim is  to publish the volume within six months 
of the Working Group meeting. A summary of the outcome is available on the 
Monographs  programme website soon after the meeting.  
B. SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND EVALUATION  
The available studies are summa rized by the Working Group, with particular regard 
to the qualitative aspects discussed below. In general, numerical findings are indicated as 
they appear in the original report; un its are converted when necessary for easier 
comparison. The Working Group may conduct additional analyses of the published data 
and use them in their assessment of the evid ence; the results of such supplementary 16 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 analyses are given in square brackets. When an  important aspect of a study that directly 
impinges on its interpretation should be bro ught to the attention of  the reader, a Working 
Group comment is given in square brackets. 
The scope of the IARC Monographs  programme has expanded beyond chemicals to 
include complex mixtures, occupational exposures, physical and biological agents, lifestyle factors and other potentially carcinogeni c exposures. Over time, the structure of a 
Monograph  has evolved to include  the following sections: 
 1. Exposure data  2. Studies of cancer in humans 
 3. Studies of cancer in experimental animals 
 4. Mechanistic and other relevant data  5. Summary 
 6. Evaluation and rationale 
In addition, a section of Ge neral Remarks at the front of the volume discusses the 
reasons the agents were scheduled for eval uation and some key issues the Working Group 
encountered during the meeting. 
This part of the Preamble discusses the types of evidence considered and summarized 
in each section of a Monograph , followed by the scientific criteria  that guide the 
evaluations. 
1. Exposure data  
Each Monograph  includes general information on the agent: this information may 
vary substantially between agents and must be adapted accordingly. Also included is 
information on production and use (when appropriate), methods of analysis and detection, occurrence, and sources and routes of human occupational and envir onmental exposures. 
Depending on the agent, regulations and guidelines for use may be presented. 
(a) General information on the agent  
For chemical agents, sections on chemical  and physical data are included: the 
Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number , the latest primary name and the IUPAC 
systematic name are recorded; other synonyms  are given, but the list is not necessarily 
comprehensive. Information on chemical and physical properties that are relevant to 
identification, occurrence and bi ological activity is included . A description of technical 
products of chemicals includes trade nam es, relevant specifications and available 
information on composition and impurities. Some of the trade names given may be those 
of mixtures in which the agent being evaluated is only one of the ingredients. 
For biological agents, taxo nomy, structure and biology are described, and the degree 
of variability is indicated. Mode of replication, life cycle, target cells, persistence, latency, 
host response and clinical disease other than cancer are also presented.  PREAMBLE 17  
 For physical agents that are forms of radia tion, energy and range of the radiation are 
included. For foreign bodies, fibres and respir able particles, size range and relative 
dimensions are indicated. 
For agents such as mixtures, drugs or lifest yle factors, a description of the agent, 
including its composition, is given. 
Whenever appropriate, othe r information, such as hist orical perspectives or the 
description of an i ndustry or habit, may be included. 
(b) Analysis and detection 
An overview of methods of an alysis and detection of the agent is presented, including 
their sensitivity, specificity and reproducibil ity. Methods widely used for regulatory 
purposes are emphasized. Methods for monitori ng human exposure ar e also given. No 
critical evaluation or recommendation of any method is meant or implied.  
(c) Production and use 
The dates of first synthesis and of first commercial production of a chemical, mixture 
or other agent are provided when available; for agents that do not occur naturally, this 
information may allow a reasonable estimate to be made of the date before which no 
human exposure to the agent could have occu rred. The dates of first reported occurrence 
of an exposure are also provided when available. In addition, methods of synthesis used in 
past and present commercial production and different methods of production, which may 
give rise to different im purities, are described.  
The countries where companies report pro duction of the agent, and the number of 
companies in each country, are identified. Av ailable data on production, international 
trade and uses are obtained for representative re gions. It should not, however, be inferred 
that those areas or nations ar e necessarily the sole or major so urces or users of the agent. 
Some identified uses may not be  current or major applicatio ns, and the coverage is not 
necessarily comprehensive. In th e case of drugs, mention of their therapeutic uses does 
not necessarily represent curre nt practice nor does it imply judgement as to their 
therapeutic efficacy.  
(d) Occurrence and exposure  
Information on the occurrence of an agent in the environment is obtained from data 
derived from the monitoring and surveillance of levels in occupational environments, air, 
water, soil, plants, foods and animal and human tissues. When available, data on the 
generation, persistence and bioaccumulation of the agent are also included. Such data may 
be available from national databases. 
Data that indicate the extent of past and present human exposure, the sources of 
exposure, the people most likely to be expo sed and the factors that contribute to the 
exposure are reported. Information is presented on the range of human exposure, 
including occupational and environmental exposures. This includes relevant findings 18 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 from both developed and developing countries. Some of  these data are not distributed 
widely and may be available from government reports and other sources. In the case of mixtures, industries, occupations or processes,  information is given about all agents 
known to be present. For processes, industries and occupati ons, a historical description is 
also given, noting variations in chemical composition, physical properties and levels of occupational exposure with date and place. For biological agents, the epidemiology of 
infection is described.  
(e) Regulations and guidelines 
Statements concerning regulat ions and guidelines (e.g. occupational exposure limits, 
maximal levels permitted in foods and water, pesticide registrations) are included, but 
they may not reflect the most recent situation,  since such limits are continuously reviewed 
and modified. The absence of information on regulatory status for a country should not be 
taken to imply that that country does not have regulations with regard to the exposure. For 
biological agents, legislat ion and control, including vaccination and therapy, are 
described.  
2. Studies of cancer in humans  
This section includes all pertinent epidemio logical studies (see Part A, Section 4). 
Studies of biomarkers are included when th ey are relevant to an evaluation of 
carcinogenicity to humans.  
(a) Types of study considered 
Several types of epidemiological study co ntribute to the assessment of carcinogenicity 
in humans — cohort studies, case–control studies, correlati on (or ecological) studies and 
intervention studies. Rarely, results from rand omized trials may be available. Case reports 
and case series of cancer in humans may also be reviewed.  
Cohort and case–control studies relate individual exposures under study to the 
occurrence of cancer in individuals and provid e an estimate of effect (such as relative 
risk) as the main measure of association. Intervention studies may provide strong 
evidence for making causal inferences, as exemplified by cessation of smoking and the 
subsequent decrease in risk for lung cancer.  
In correlation studies, the units of investigation are usually whole populations (e.g. in 
particular geographical areas or at particul ar times), and cancer frequency is related to a 
summary measure of the exposure of the population to the ag ent under study. In 
correlation studies, individual  exposure is not documented, which renders this kind of 
study more prone to confounding. In some ci rcumstances, however, correlation studies 
may be more informative than analytical  study designs (see,  for example, the Monograph  
on arsenic in drinking-water; IARC, 2004).  PREAMBLE 19  
 In some instances, case reports and case seri es have provided important information 
about the carcinogenicity of an agent. Th ese types of study generally arise from a 
suspicion, based on clinical experience, that the concurrence of two events — that is, a 
particular exposure and occurrence of a can cer — has happened rather more frequently 
than would be expected by chance. Case re ports and case series usually lack complete 
ascertainment of cases in any population, defini tion or enumeration of the population at 
risk and estimation of the expected numbe r of cases in the absence of exposure.  
The uncertainties that surro und the interpretation of  case reports, case series and 
correlation studies make them inadequate, except in rare inst ances, to form the sole basis 
for inferring a causal relation ship. When taken together with case–control and cohort 
studies, however, these types of study may ad d materially to the j udgement that a causal 
relationship exists.  
Epidemiological studies of benign neoplasms, presumed preneoplastic lesions and 
other end-points thought to be relevant to cancer are also reviewed. They may, in some 
instances, strengthen inferences drawn from studies of cancer itself.  
(b) Quality of studies considered 
It is necessary to take  into account the po ssible roles of bias , confounding and chance 
in the interpretation of epidemiological studies.  Bias is the effect of factors in study design 
or execution that lead erroneous ly to a stronger or weaker asso ciation than in fact exists 
between an agent and disease.  Confounding is a form of bias that occurs when the 
relationship with disease is made to appear str onger or weaker than it truly is as a result of 
an association between the apparent causal fact or and another factor that is associated 
with either an increase or decrease in the inci dence of the disease. The role of chance is 
related to biological variability and the in fluence of sample size on the precision of 
estimates of effect. 
In evaluating the extent to which these fact ors have been minimized in an individual 
study, consideration is given to a number of aspects of design and analysis as described in 
the report of the study. For example, when suspicion of carcinogenicity arises largely 
from a single small study, careful considerati on is given when interpreting subsequent 
studies that included these data  in an enlarged population. Most of these considerations 
apply equally to case–control, co hort and correlation studies. Lack of clarity of any of 
these aspects in the reporting of a study can decrease its credibility and the weight given 
to it in the final evaluation of the exposure.  
Firstly, the study populatio n, disease (or diseases) and exposure should have been 
well defined by the authors. Cases of disease in  the study population should have been 
identified in a way that was independent of the exposure of interest, and exposure should 
have been assessed in a way that was not related to disease status.  
Secondly, the authors should have taken into account — in the study design and 
analysis — other variables that can influe nce the risk of disease and may have been 
related to the exposure of interest. Potential confounding by such variables should have 
been dealt with either in the design of the study, such as by matching, or in the analysis, 20 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 by statistical adjustment. In cohort studies,  comparisons with local rates of disease may or 
may not be more appropriate than those with  national rates. Internal comparisons of 
frequency of disease among individuals at differe nt levels of exposure are also desirable 
in cohort studies, since they minimize the potential for confounding related to the 
difference in risk factors between an extern al reference group and the study population.  
Thirdly, the authors should have reported the basic data on which the conclusions are 
founded, even if sophisticated statistical an alyses were employed. At the very least, they 
should have given the numbers of expose d and unexposed cases and controls in a case–
control study and the numbers of cases observed and expected in a cohort study. Further 
tabulations by time since exposure began and other temporal factors are also important. In 
a cohort study, data on all cancer sites and a ll causes of death should have been given, to 
reveal the possibility of reporting bias. In a case–control study, the effects of investigated 
factors other than the exposure of in terest should have been reported.  
Finally, the statistical methods used to obtain estimates of relative risk, absolute rates 
of cancer, confidence intervals and significa nce tests, and to adjust for confounding 
should have been clearly stated by the authors. These methods have been reviewed for 
case–control studies (Breslow & Day, 1980) and for cohort studies (Breslow & Day, 
1987).  
(c) Meta-analyses and pooled analyses 
Independent epidemiological st udies of the same agent may lead to results that are 
difficult to interpret. Comb ined analyses of data from multiple studies are a means of 
resolving this ambiguity, and well-conducted  analyses can be considered. There are two 
types of combined analysis. The first in volves combining summary statistics such as 
relative risks from individual studies (met a-analysis) and the second involves a pooled 
analysis of the raw data from  the individual studies (pooled analysis) (Greenland, 1998).  
The advantages of combined analyses are increased precision due to increased sample 
size and the opportunity to explore potential confounders, interactions and modifying 
effects that may explain heterogeneity among studies in more detail. A disadvantage of 
combined analyses is the possibl e lack of compatibility of da ta from various studies due 
to differences in subject recruitment, procedures of data collection, methods of 
measurement and effects of unmeasured co-variates that may differ among studies. 
Despite these limitations, well-conducted combin ed analyses may provide a firmer basis 
than individual studies for drawing conclusi ons about the potential carcinogenicity of 
agents.  
IARC may commission a meta-analysis or pooled analysis that is pertinent to a 
particular Monograph  (see Part A, Section 4). Additiona lly, as a means of gaining insight 
from the results of multiple indi vidual studies, ad-hoc calculations that combine data from 
different studies may be conducted by the Working Group during the course of a 
Monograph  meeting. The results of such original  calculations, which would be specified 
in the text by presentation in square br ackets, might involve updates of previously 
conducted analyses that incorporate the r esults of more recent studies or de-novo  PREAMBLE 21  
 analyses. Irrespective of the source of data fo r the meta-analyses and pooled analyses, it is 
important that the same criteria for data qual ity be applied as those that would be applied 
to individual studies and to ensure also th at sources of heterogeneity between studies be 
taken into account. 
(d) Temporal effects 
Detailed analyses of both relative and absolute  risks in relation to temporal variables, 
such as age at first exposure, time since firs t exposure, duration of exposure, cumulative 
exposure, peak exposure (when appropriat e) and time since cessation of exposure, are 
reviewed and summarized when available. Analyses of temporal relationships may be 
useful in making cau sal inferences. In ad dition, such analyses may suggest whether a 
carcinogen acts early or late in the process of  carcinogenesis, although , at best, they allow 
only indirect inferences abou t mechanisms of carcinogenesis.  
(e) Use of biomarkers in epidemiological studies 
Biomarkers indicate molecular, cellular or other biological changes and are 
increasingly used in epidemio logical studies for various purposes (IARC, 1991; Vainio et 
al., 1992; Toniolo et al. , 1997; Vineis et al. , 1999; Buffler et al. , 2004). These may 
include evidence of exposure, of early effects, of cellular, tiss ue or organism responses, of 
individual susceptibility or host responses,  and inference of a mechanism (see Part B, 
Section 4b). This is a rapidl y evolving field that encompasses developments in genomics, 
epigenomics and other emerging technologies.  
Molecular epidemiological data that identify associations between genetic 
polymorphisms and interindividual differences in susceptibility to the agent(s) being 
evaluated may contribute to the identificatio n of carcinogenic hazards to humans. If the 
polymorphism has been demonstrated experimentally to modify the functional activity of 
the gene product in a manner that is consis tent with increased susceptibility, these data 
may be useful in making causal inferences. Similarly, molecular ep idemiological studies 
that measure cell functions, enzymes or metabol ites that are thought to be the basis of 
susceptibility may pr ovide evidence that rein forces biological plausi bility. It should be 
noted, however, that when data on genetic susceptibility originate from multiple comparisons that arise from su bgroup analyses, this can genera te false-positive results and 
inconsistencies across studies, and such data therefore require careful evaluation. If the 
known phenotype of a genetic polymorphism can explain the carcinogenic mechanism of the agent being evaluated, data on this phenotype may be useful in making causal 
inferences.  
(f) Criteria for causality 
After the quality of individual epidemiologi cal studies of cancer has been summarized 
and assessed, a judgement is made concerning th e strength of evidence that the agent in 
question is carcinogenic to humans. In making its judgement, the Working Group 22 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 considers several criteria for causality (Hill , 1965). A strong association (e.g. a large 
relative risk) is more likely to indicate cau sality than a weak associ ation, although it is 
recognized that estimates of effect of small magnitude do not imply lack of causality and 
may be important if the disease or exposure is  common. Associations that are replicated 
in several studies of the same  design or that use different  epidemiological approaches or 
under different circumstances of exposure are more likely to represent a causal 
relationship than isolated observations from si ngle studies. If there are inconsistent results 
among investigations, possible reasons are sought (such as differences in exposure), and results of studies that are judged to be of high quality are given more weight than those of 
studies that are judged to be methodologically less sound.  
If the risk increases with the exposure, this is  considered to be a strong indication of 
causality, although the absence of a graded response is not necessarily evidence against a 
causal relationship. The demonstration of a decl ine in risk after cessation of or reduction 
in exposure in individuals or in whole populations also supports a causal interpretation of the findings.  
A number of scenarios may increase confidence in a causal relati onship. On the one 
hand, an agent may be specific in causing tu mours at one site or of one morphological 
type. On the other, carcinogenicity may be evident through the causation of multiple 
tumour types. Temporality, precision of estim ates of effect, biological plausibility and 
coherence of the overall database are consid ered. Data on biomarkers may be employed 
in an assessment of the biological plausi bility of epidemiological observations.  
Although rarely available, results from rand omized trials that show different rates of 
cancer among exposed and unexposed individual s provide particularly strong evidence 
for causality.  
When several epidemiological studies show little or no indication of an association 
between an exposure and cancer, a judgement may be made that, in the aggregate, they show evidence of lack of carcinogenicity. Such a judgement requires firstly that the 
studies meet, to a sufficient degree, the standards of design and analysis described above. 
Specifically, the possibility that bias, conf ounding or misclassification of exposure or 
outcome could explain the observed results should be considered and excluded with 
reasonable certainty. In addition,  all studies that are judged to  be methodologically sound 
should (a) be consistent with an estimate of effect of unity for any observed level of exposure, (b) when considered together, provide a pooled estimate of re lative risk that is 
at or near to unity, and (c) have a narrow co nfidence interval, due to sufficient population 
size. Moreover, no individual study nor the pool ed results of all the studies should show 
any consistent tendency that the relative risk of cancer increases with increasing level of 
exposure. It is important to note that eviden ce of lack of carcinogenicity obtained from 
several epidemiological studies ca n apply only to the type(s) of cancer studied, to the dose 
levels reported, and to the intervals between  first exposure and disease onset observed in 
these studies. Experience with human cancer in dicates that the period from first exposure 
to the development of clinical cancer is sometimes longer than 20 years; latent periods substantially shorter than 30 years cannot pr ovide evidence for lack of carcinogenicity.  PREAMBLE 23  
 3. Studies of cancer in experimental animals 
All known human carcinogens that have been studied adequately for carcinogenicity 
in experimental animals have produced posit ive results in one or more animal species 
(Wilbourn et al. , 1986; Tomatis et al. , 1989). For several agents (e.g. aflatoxins, 
diethylstilbestrol, solar radiation, vinyl chlori de), carcinogenicity in experimental animals 
was established or highly suspected before  epidemiological st udies confirmed their 
carcinogenicity in humans (Vainio et al. , 1995). Although this association cannot 
establish that all agents th at cause cancer in experimental  animals also cause cancer in 
humans, it is biologically plausibl e that agents for which there is sufficient evidence of 
carcinogenicity  in experimental animals (see Pa rt B, Section 6b) also present a 
carcinogenic hazard to humans.  Accordingly, in the absen ce of additional scientific 
information, these agents are considered to pose a carcinogenic  hazard to humans. 
Examples of additional scientific information ar e data that demonstrate that a given agent 
causes cancer in animals through a species-sp ecific mechanism that does not operate in 
humans or data that demonstrate that the mechanism in experimental animals also 
operates in humans (see Part B, Section 6). 
Consideration is given to all available long -term studies of cancer in experimental 
animals with the agent under review (see Part A, Section 4). In all experimental settings, 
the nature and extent of impurities or cont aminants present in the agent being evaluated 
are given when available. Animal species, strain (including genetic background where 
applicable), sex, numbers per group, age at  start of treatment, route of exposure, dose 
levels, duration of exposure, survival and information on tumours (incidence, latency, 
severity or multiplicity of neoplasms or preneo plastic lesions) are reported. Those studies 
in experimental animals that ar e judged to be irrelevant to the evaluation or judged to be 
inadequate (e.g. too short a du ration, too few animals, poor survival; see below) may be 
omitted. Guidelines for conducting long-term carcinogenicity experiments have been published (e.g. OECD, 2002). 
Other studies considered may include:  experiments in which the agent was 
administered in the presence of factors that  modify carcinogenic effects (e.g. initiation–
promotion studies, co-carcinogenicity studies and studies in genetically modified 
animals); studies in which the end-point was not cancer but a defined precancerous lesion; 
experiments on the carcinogenicity of known metabolites and derivatives; and studies of cancer in non-laboratory animals (e.g. livest ock and companion animals) exposed to the 
agent. 
For studies of mixtures, consideration is gi ven to the possibility that changes in the 
physicochemical properties of the individual substances may occur during collection, 
storage, extraction, concentration and delivery. Another consideration is that chemical and 
toxicological interactions of components in a mixture may alter dose–response relationships. The relevance to human exposur e of the test mixture administered in the 
animal experiment is also assessed. This ma y involve consideration of the following 
aspects of the mixture tested: (i) physical and chemical characteristics, (ii) identified 24 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 constituents that may indicate the presence of a class of substances and (iii) the results of 
genetic toxicity and related tests. 
The relevance of results obtained with an agent that is analogous (e.g. similar in 
structure or of a similar virus genus) to that being evaluated is also considered. Such 
results may provide biological and mechanis tic information that is relevant to the 
understanding of the process of carcinoge nesis in humans and may strengthen the 
biological plausibi lity that the agent being evaluated is  carcinogenic to humans (see Part 
B, Section 2f). 
(a) Qualitative aspects 
An assessment of carcinogenicity involves se veral considerations of qualitative 
importance, including (i) the experimental cond itions under which the test was performed, 
including route, schedule and duration of exposure, species, strain (including genetic 
background where applicable), sex, age and duration of follow-up; (ii) the consistency of 
the results, for example, acro ss species and target organ(s); (i ii) the spectrum of neoplastic 
response, from preneoplastic lesions and beni gn tumours to malignant neoplasms; and 
(iv) the possible role of modifying factors. 
Considerations of importance in the interpretation and evaluation of a particular study 
include: (i) how clearly th e agent was defined and, in the case of mixtures, how 
adequately the sample characterization was re ported; (ii) whether the dose was monitored 
adequately, particularly in inhalation experiment s; (iii) whether th e doses, duration of 
treatment and route of exposure were appropri ate; (iv) whether the survival of treated 
animals was similar to that of controls; (v ) whether there were adequate numbers of 
animals per group; (vi) whether both male and female animals were  used; (vii) whether 
animals were allocated randomly to groups; (vii i) whether the duration of observation was 
adequate; and (ix) whether the data we re reported and analysed adequately. 
When benign tumours (a) occur together with and originate from the same cell type as 
malignant tumours in an organ or tissue in a particular study and (b) appear to represent a 
stage in the progressi on to malignancy, they are usua lly combined in  the assessment of 
tumour incidence (Huff et al. , 1989). The occurrence of lesions presumed to be 
preneoplastic may in certain instances aid in  assessing the biological plausibility of any 
neoplastic response observed. If an agent indu ces only benign neoplasms that appear to be 
end-points that do not readily undergo transition to malignancy, the agent should nevertheless be suspected of being carcinog enic and requires further investigation. 
(b) Quantitative aspects  
The probability that tumours will occur may depend on the species, sex, strain, 
genetic background and age of the animal, and on the dose, route, timing and duration of 
the exposure. Evidence of an increased inciden ce of neoplasms with increasing levels of 
exposure strengthens the inference of a cau sal association between the exposure and the 
development of neoplasms.  PREAMBLE 25  
 The form of the dose–respon se relationship can vary widely, depending on the 
particular agent under study and the target or gan. Mechanisms such as induction of DNA 
damage or inhibition of repair, altered cell division and cell death rates and changes in 
intercellular communication are important de terminants of dose–response relationships 
for some carcinogens. Since many chemicals require metabolic activation before being converted to their reactive in termediates, both metabolic and toxicokinetic aspects are 
important in determining the dose–respon se pattern. Saturation of steps such as 
absorption, activation, inactivation and elimination may produce non-linearity in the dose–response relationship (Hoel et al. , 1983; Gart et al. , 1986), as could saturation of 
processes such as DNA repair. The dose–respon se relationship can also be affected by 
differences in survival among the treatment groups. 
(c) Statistical analyses 
Factors considered include the adequacy of  the information given for each treatment 
group: (i) number of animals studied and numb er examined histologi cally, (ii) number of 
animals with a given tumour type and (iii) leng th of survival. The st atistical methods used 
should be clearly stated and should be the generally accepte d techniques refined for this 
purpose (Peto et al. , 1980; Gart et al. , 1986; Portier & Bailer, 1989; Bieler & Williams, 
1993). The choice of the most appropriate statistical method requires consideration of 
whether or not there are differences in surviv al among the treatment groups; for example, 
reduced survival because of no n-tumour-related mortality can  preclude the occurrence of 
tumours later in life. When detailed informati on on survival is not available, comparisons 
of the proportions of tumour-bearing animals among the effective number of animals 
(alive at the time the first tumour was di scovered) can be usef ul when significant 
differences in survival occur before tumours appear. The lethality of the tumour also 
requires consideration: for rapidly fatal tum ours, the time of death provides an indication 
of the time of tumour onset and can be assessed using life-table methods; non-fatal or 
incidental tumours that do not affect surv ival can be assessed using methods such as the 
Mantel-Haenzel test for changes in tumour prevalence. Because tumour lethality is often 
difficult to determine, methods such as the Poly-K test that do not require such information can also be used. When results  are available on the number and size of 
tumours seen in experimental animals (e.g. papillomas on mouse skin, liver tumours 
observed through nuclear magnetic resonance tomography), other more complicated statistical procedures may be needed (Sherman et al. , 1994; Dunson et al. , 2003). 
Formal statistical methods have been develo ped to incorporate historical control data 
into the analysis of data from a given experiment. These methods assign an appropriate weight to historical and concurrent controls on the basis of the extent of between-study 
and within-study variability: less weight is give n to historical controls when they show a 
high degree of variability, and greater weight when they show little variability. It is generally not appropriate to discount a tum our response that is significantly increased 
compared with concurrent contro ls by arguing that it falls within the range of historical 
controls, particularly when hi storical controls show high between-study variability and 26 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 are, thus, of little relevance to the current experiment. In analysing results for uncommon 
tumours, however, the analysis may be improved by considering historical control data, particularly when between-study variability is low. Historical contro ls should be selected 
to resemble the concurrent controls as closel y as possible with respect to species, gender 
and strain, as well as other factors such as b asal diet and general laboratory environment, 
which may affect tumour-response rates in control animals (Haseman et al. , 1984; Fung et 
al., 1996; Greim et al. , 2003). 
Although meta-analyses and combined anal yses are conducted less frequently for 
animal experiments than for epidemiological st udies due to differences in animal strains, 
they can be useful aids in interpreting animal data when the experimental protocols are 
sufficiently similar. 
4. Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Mechanistic and other relevant data may provide evidence of carcinogenicity and also 
help in assessing the relevance and importance of findings of cancer in animals and in 
humans. The nature of the mechanistic and othe r relevant data depends on the biological 
activity of the agent being considered. Th e Working Group considers representative 
studies to give a concise description of the rele vant data and issues that they consider to 
be important; thus, not every available study is cited. Relevant topics may include 
toxicokinetics, mechanisms of carcinogenesi s, susceptible individuals, populations and 
life-stages, other relevant data and other adverse effects. When data on biomarkers are informative about the mechanisms of carcinoge nesis, they are included in this section. 
These topics are not mutually exclusive; th us, the same studies may be discussed in 
more than one subsection. For example, a mu tation in a gene that codes for an enzyme 
that metabolizes the agent un der study could be discussed in the subsections on 
toxicokinetics, mechanisms and individual suscept ibility if it also exists as an inherited 
polymorphism. 
(a) Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics refers to the absorption, di stribution, metabolism and elimination of 
agents in humans, experimental animals and,  where relevant, cellular systems. Examples 
of kinetic factors that may affect dose–resp onse relationships include uptake, deposition, 
biopersistence and half-life in tissues, protein binding, metabolic activation and 
detoxification. Studies that in dicate the metabolic fate of the agent in humans and in 
experimental animals are summarized briefly,  and comparisons of data from humans and 
animals are made when possible. Comparativ e information on the relationship between 
exposure and the dose that reach es the target site may be important for the extrapolation 
of hazards between species and in clarif ying the role of in-vitro findings.  PREAMBLE 27  
 (b) Data on mechanisms of carcinogenesis 
To provide focus, th e Working Group attempts to id entify the possible mechanisms 
by which the agent may increase the risk of  cancer. For each possible mechanism, a 
representative selection of key data from humans and experimental systems is 
summarized. Attention is given to gaps in the da ta and to data that suggests that more than 
one mechanism may be operating. The re levance of the mechanism to humans is 
discussed, in particular, when mechanistic data are derived from experimental model 
systems. Changes in the affected organs, ti ssues or cells can be divided into three non-
exclusive levels as described below. 
(i) Changes in physiology  
Physiological changes refer to exposure-related modifications to the physiology 
and/or response of cells, tissues and organs. Examples of potentially adverse physiological changes includ e mitogenesis, compensatory cell division, escape from 
apoptosis and/or senescence,  presence of inflammation,  hyperplasia, metaplasia 
and/or preneoplasia, angiogenesis, altera tions in cellular adhesion, changes in 
steroidal hormones and changes in immune surveillance. 
(ii) Functional changes at the cellular level 
Functional changes refer to exposure-re lated alterations in the signalling 
pathways used by cells to manage critical  processes that are related to increased risk 
for cancer. Examples of functional chang es include modified activities of enzymes 
involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, alterations in the expression of key genes 
that regulate DNA repair, alterations in cy clin-dependent kinases that govern cell 
cycle progression, changes in the pattern s of post-translationa l modifications of 
proteins, changes in regulatory factors th at alter apoptotic ra tes, changes in the 
secretion of factors related to the stimula tion of DNA replicati on and transcription 
and changes in gap–junction-mediat ed intercellular communication. 
(iii) Changes at the molecular level 
Molecular changes refer to exposure-relate d changes in key cellular structures at 
the molecular level, including, in partic ular, genotoxicity. Examples of molecular 
changes include formation of DNA adducts  and DNA strand breaks, mutations in 
genes, chromosomal aberrations, aneupl oidy and changes in DNA methylation 
patterns. Greater emphasis is given to irreversible effects. 
The use of mechanistic data in the identifica tion of a carcinogenic hazard is specific to 
the mechanism being addressed and is not readily described for every possible level and 
mechanism discussed above. 
Genotoxicity data are discussed here to illustrate the key issues involved in the 
evaluation of mechanistic data. 
Tests for genetic and related effects are described in view of the relevance of 
gene mutation and chromosomal aberration /aneuploidy to carci nogenesis (Vainio 28 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 et al., 1992; McGregor et al., 1999). The adequacy of the reporting of sample 
characterization is considered and, when necessary, commented upon; with 
regard to complex mixtures, such comme nts are similar to those described for 
animal carcinogenicity tests. The ava ilable data are interpreted critically 
according to the end-points detected, which may include DNA damage, gene mutation, sister chromatid exchange, micronucleus formation, chromosomal 
aberrations and aneuploidy. The concentra tions employed are given, and mention 
is made of whether the use of an exogenous metabolic system in vitro  affected the 
test result. These data are listed in tabu lar form by phylogen etic classification. 
Positive results in tests using prokaryotes, lower e ukaryotes, insects, plants 
and cultured mammalian cells suggest that genetic and related effects could occur 
in mammals. Results from such tests may also give information on the types of 
genetic effect produced and on the invol vement of metabolic activation. Some 
end-points described are clearly genetic in nature (e.g. gene mutations), while others are associated with genetic effect s (e.g. unscheduled DNA synthesis). In-
vitro tests for tumour promotion, cell transformation and gap–junction 
intercellular communication may be sensi tive to changes that are not necessarily 
the result of genetic alterations but that may have specific relevance to the process 
of carcinogenesis. Critical appraisals of these tests have been published 
(Montesano et al., 1986; McGregor et al., 1999). 
Genetic or other activity manifest in humans and experimental mammals is 
regarded to be of greater relevance than that in other organisms. The 
demonstration that an agent can indu ce gene and chromosomal mutations in 
mammals in vivo indicates that it may have carcino genic activity. Negative results 
in tests for mutagenicity in sel ected tissues from animals treated in vivo provide 
less weight, partly because they do not ex clude the possibility of an effect in 
tissues other than those exam ined. Moreover, negative results in short-term tests 
with genetic end-points cannot be consid ered to provide evidence that rules out 
the carcinogenicity of agents that act th rough other mechanisms (e.g. receptor-
mediated effects, cellular toxicity with  regenerative cell division, peroxisome 
proliferation) (Vainio et al., 1992). Factors that may give misleading results in 
short-term tests have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Montesano et al., 1986; 
McGregor et al., 1999). 
When there is evidence that an agent act s by a specific mechanism that does not 
involve genotoxicity (e.g. ho rmonal dysregulation, immune suppression, and formation of 
calculi and other deposits th at cause chronic irritation), that evidence is presented and 
reviewed critically in the context of rigorous criteria for the operation of that mechanism 
in carcinogenesis (e.g. Capen et al. , 1999). 
For biological agents such as viruses, bacter ia and parasites, other data relevant to 
carcinogenicity may include descriptions of th e pathology of infection, integration and 
expression of viruses, and genetic  alterations seen in human tumours. Other observations  PREAMBLE 29  
 that might comprise cellular and tissue respon ses to infection, immune response and the 
presence of tumour markers are also considered. 
For physical agents that are forms of radiation, other data relevant to carcinogenicity 
may include descriptions of dama ging effects at the physiological, cellular and molecular 
level, as for chemical agents, and descript ions of how these effects occur. ‘Physical 
agents’ may also be considered to comprise fo reign bodies, such as surgical implants of 
various kinds, and poorly soluble fibres, du sts and particles of various sizes, the 
pathogenic effects of which are a result of their physical presence in tissues or body 
cavities. Other relevant data for such materi als may include characterization of cellular, 
tissue and physiological reactions to these materials and descriptions of pathological 
conditions other than neoplasia wi th which they may be associated. 
(c) Other data relevant to mechanisms 
A description is provided of any structure–activity relationships that may be relevant 
to an evaluation of the carcinogenicity of an agent, the toxicological implications of the 
physical and chemical properties, and any other data relevant to the evaluation that are not 
included elsewhere. 
High-output data, such as those derived fr om gene expression microarrays, and high-
throughput data, such as those that result from testing hundreds of agents for a single end-
point, pose a unique problem for the use of mechanistic data in the evaluation of a 
carcinogenic hazard. In the case of high-o utput data, there is  the possibility to 
overinterpret changes in indi vidual end-points (e .g. changes in expr ession in one gene) 
without considering the consistency of that finding in the broader context of the other 
end-points (e.g. other genes with linked tran scriptional control). High-output data can be 
used in assessing mechanisms, but all end-points measured in a single experiment need to 
be considered in the proper context. For high-throughput data, where the number of 
observations far exceeds the number of end-poin ts measured, their utility for identifying 
common mechanisms across multiple agents is  enhanced. These data can be used to 
identify mechanisms that not only seem plausible, but also have a consistent pattern of 
carcinogenic response across entire classes of related compounds. 
(d) Susceptibility data 
Individuals, populations and li fe-stages may have greater or  lesser susceptibility to an 
agent, based on toxicokinetics, mechanisms of carcinogenesis and other factors. Examples 
of host and genetic factors that affect in dividual susceptibility  include sex, genetic 
polymorphisms of genes involved in the metabolism of the agent under evaluation, 
differences in metabolic capacity  due to life-stage or the pr esence of disease, differences 
in DNA repair capacity, competition for or alteration of metabolic capacity by 
medications or other chemical exposures, pre-existing hormonal imbalance that is 
exacerbated by a chemical exposure, a suppressed immune system, periods of higher-than-usual tissue growth or regeneration and genetic polymorphisms that lead to 30 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 differences in behaviour (e.g. addiction). Such  data can substantiall y increase the strength 
of the evidence from epidemiological data and enhance the linkage of in-vivo and in-vitro 
laboratory studies to humans. 
(e) Data on other adverse effects 
Data on acute, subchronic and chronic adverse effects relevant to the cancer 
evaluation are summarized. Adverse effects that confirm distribution and biological 
effects at the sites of tumour development, or  alterations in physiology that could lead to 
tumour development, are emphasized. Effects on reproduction, embryonic and fetal survival and development are summarized br iefly. The adequacy of epidemiological 
studies of reproductive outcome and genetic and related effects in humans is judged by 
the same criteria as those applied to epidemiolo gical studies of cancer, but fewer details 
are given. 
5. Summary  
This section is a summary of data present ed in the preceding sections. Summaries can 
be found on the Monographs  programme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr).  
(a) Exposure data  
Data are summarized, as appropriate, on the basis of elements such as production, 
use, occurrence and exposure levels in th e workplace and environment and measurements 
in human tissues and body fluids. Quantitative data and time trends are given to compare 
exposures in different occupations and envi ronmental settings. Exposure to biological 
agents is described in terms of transmissi on, prevalence and persistence of infection.  
(b) Cancer in humans 
Results of epidemiological studies pertinent to an assessment of human 
carcinogenicity are summarized. When relevant , case reports and correlation studies are 
also summarized. The target organ(s) or tissue(s) in which an increase in cancer was 
observed is identified. Dose–response and other quantitative data may be summarized when available.  
(c) Cancer in experimental animals 
Data relevant to an evaluation of carcinoge nicity in animals are summarized. For each 
animal species, study design an d route of administration, it is  stated whether an increased 
incidence, reduced latency, or increased severity or multiplicity of neoplasms or 
preneoplastic lesions were observed, and th e tumour sites are indicated. If the agent 
produced tumours after prenatal exposure or in single-dose experiments, this is also 
mentioned. Negative findings, inverse rela tionships, dose–response and other quantitative 
data are also summarized.   PREAMBLE 31  
 (d) Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Data relevant to the toxicokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) 
and the possible mechanis m(s) of carcinogenesis (e.g. genetic  toxicity, epigenetic effects) 
are summarized. In addition, in formation on susceptible indivi duals, populations and life-
stages is summarized. This section also re ports on other toxic effects, including 
reproductive and developmental effects, as we ll as additional relevant data that are 
considered to be important. 
6. Evaluation and rationale  
Evaluations of the strength of the eviden ce for carcinogenicity arising from human 
and experimental animal data are made, using standard terms. The strength of the 
mechanistic evidence is also characterized.  
It is recognized that the criteria for these evaluations, descr ibed below, cannot 
encompass all of the factors that may be releva nt to an evaluation of carcinogenicity. In 
considering all of the relevant scientific data, the Working Group may assign the agent to 
a higher or lower category than a strict in terpretation of these cr iteria would indicate.  
These categories refer only to the strength  of the evidence that an exposure is 
carcinogenic and not to the extent of its car cinogenic activity (poten cy). A classification 
may change as new information becomes available.  
An evaluation of the degree of evidence is  limited to the materials tested, as defined 
physically, chemically or biologically. When the agents evaluated are considered by the 
Working Group to be sufficiently closely related, they may be grouped together for the purpose of a single evaluation of the degree of evidence.  
(a) Carcinogenicity in humans 
The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity from  studies in humans is classified into one 
of the following categories:  
Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity : The Working Group considers that a causal 
relationship has been established betwee n exposure to the ag ent and human cancer. 
That is, a positive relationship has been ob served between the exposure and cancer in 
studies in which chance, bias and confound ing could be ruled out with reasonable 
confidence. A statement that there is sufficient evidence  is followed by a separate 
sentence that identifies the target organ(s) or tissue(s) where an increased risk of 
cancer was observed in humans. Identification of a specific target organ or tissue does 
not preclude the possibility that the agent may cause cancer at other sites.  
Limited evidence of carcinogenicity : A positive association has been observed between 
exposure to the agent and cancer for which a causal interpretation is considered by the 
Working Group to be credible, but chance, bias or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence.  32 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity : The available studies ar e of insufficient quality, 
consistency or statistical power to permit a conclusion regarding the presence or absence of a causal association between exposu re and cancer, or no data on cancer in 
humans are available.  
Evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity : There are several adequate studies covering 
the full range of levels of exposure that  humans are known to encounter, which are 
mutually consistent in not showing a pos itive association between exposure to the 
agent and any studied cancer at any observe d level of exposure. The results from 
these studies alone or combined should have  narrow confidence intervals with an 
upper limit close to the null value (e.g. a relative risk of 1.0). Bias and confounding 
should be ruled out with reasonable conf idence, and the studies should have an 
adequate length of follow-up. A conclusion of evidence suggesting lack of 
carcinogenicity  is inevitably limited to the cancer sites, conditions and levels of 
exposure, and length of observation covered by the available studies. In addition, the 
possibility of a very small risk at the levels of exposure studied can never be 
excluded.  
In some instances, the above categories may be used to classify the degree of 
evidence related to carcinogenicity  in specific organs or tissues. 
When the available epidemiolo gical studies pertain to a mi xture, process, occupation 
or industry, the Working Grou p seeks to identify the specific agent considered most likely 
to be responsible for any excess risk. The evaluation is focused as narrowly as the 
available data on exposure and other aspects permit.  
(b) Carcinogenicity in experimental animals 
Carcinogenicity in experimental animal s can be evaluated using conventional 
bioassays, bioassays that employ genetical ly modified animals, and other in-vivo 
bioassays that focus on one or more of the cri tical stages of carcinogenesis. In the absence 
of data from conventional long-term bioass ays or from assays with neoplasia as the end-
point, consistently positive results in seve ral models that address several stages in the 
multistage process of carcinogenesis should be  considered in evaluating the degree of 
evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. 
The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity in experimental animals is classified into one 
of the following categories:  
Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity : The Working Group considers that a causal 
relationship has been established between the agent and an increased incidence of 
malignant neoplasms or of an appropriate combination of benign and malignant neoplasms in (a) two or more species of animals or (b) two or more independent 
studies in one species carried out at different times or in different laboratories or 
under different protocols. An increased incide nce of tumours in both sexes of a single  PREAMBLE 33  
 species in a well-conducted study, ideal ly conducted under Good Laboratory 
Practices, can also provide sufficient evidence . 
A single study in one species and sex  might be considered to provide sufficient 
evidence of carcinogenicity  when malignant neoplasms occur to an unusual degree 
with regard to incidence, site, type of tumo ur or age at onset, or when there are strong 
findings of tumours at multiple sites.  
Limited evidence of carcinogenicity : The data suggest a carcinogenic effect but are 
limited for making a definitive evaluation because, e.g. (a) the evidence of carcinogenicity is restricted to a single ex periment; (b) there are unresolved questions 
regarding the adequacy of the design, conduct or interpretation of the studies; (c) the 
agent increases the incidence only of beni gn neoplasms or lesions of uncertain 
neoplastic potential; or (d) the evidence of car cinogenicity is restricted to studies that 
demonstrate only promoting activity in a narrow range of tissues or organs.  
Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity : The studies cannot be interpreted as showing 
either the presence or absence of a carcinogenic effect because of major qualitative or 
quantitative limitations, or no data on cancer in experimental animals are available.  
Evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity : Adequate studies involving at least two 
species are available which show that, within the limits of the tests used, the agent is 
not carcinogenic. A conclusion of evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity  is 
inevitably limited to the species, tumour sit es, age at exposure, and conditions and 
levels of exposure studied.  
(c) Mechanistic and other relevant data 
Mechanistic and other evid ence judged to be relevant to an evaluation of 
carcinogenicity and of sufficient importance to affect the overall evaluation is highlighted. 
This may include data on preneoplastic lesi ons, tumour pathology, genetic and related 
effects, structure–activity relationships, me tabolism and toxicokinetics, physicochemical 
parameters and analogou s biological agents.  
The strength of the eviden ce that any carcinogenic effect observed is due to a 
particular mechanism is evaluated, using te rms such as ‘weak’, ‘moderate’ or ‘strong’. 
The Working Group th en assesses whether that particular mechanism is likely to be 
operative in humans. The strongest indications  that a particular mechanism operates in 
humans derive from data on humans or bi ological specimens obtained from exposed 
humans. The data may be considered to be especi ally relevant if they show that the agent 
in question has caused chang es in exposed humans that are on the causal pathway to 
carcinogenesis. Such data may, however, neve r become available, because it is at least 
conceivable that certain compounds may be kept from human use solely on the basis of 
evidence of their toxicity and/or car cinogenicity in experimental systems.  
The conclusion that a mechanism operates in experimental animals is strengthened by 
findings of consistent results in different e xperimental systems, by the demonstration of 34 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 biological plausibi lity and by coherence of the overall database. Strong support can be 
obtained from studies that challenge the hypothesized mechanism experimentally, by 
demonstrating that the suppression of key mechanistic processes leads to the suppression 
of tumour development. The Working Group considers whether multiple mechanisms 
might contribute to tumour development, whether different mechanisms might operate in different dose ranges, whether separate mechanisms might operate in humans and 
experimental animals and whether a unique mechanism might operate in a susceptible 
group. The possible contribution of alternat ive mechanisms must be considered before 
concluding that tumours observed in experiment al animals are not relevant to humans. An 
uneven level of experimental support for different mechanisms may reflect that 
disproportionate resources have been focused  on investigating a favoured mechanism.  
For complex exposures, including occupa tional and industrial exposures, the 
chemical composition and the potential contri bution of carcinogens known to be present 
are considered by the Working Group in its overall eval uation of human carcinogenicity. 
The Working Group also determines the exte nt to which the materials tested in 
experimental systems are related to those to which humans are exposed.  
(d) Overall evaluation 
Finally, the body of evidence is considered as a whole, in order to reach an overall 
evaluation of the carcinogenic ity of the agent to humans.  
An evaluation may be made for a group of ag ents that have been evaluated by the 
Working Group. In addition, when supporting data indicate that other related agents, for 
which there is no direct evidence of their cap acity to induce cancer in humans or in 
animals, may also be carcinogenic, a statemen t describing the rationale for this conclusion 
is added to the evaluation narrative; an additional evaluation may be made for this broader 
group of agents if the strength of the evidence warrants it.  
The agent is described according to the wo rding of one of the following categories, 
and the designated group is given. The catego rization of an agent is a matter of scientific 
judgement that reflects the strength of the evidence derived from studies in humans and in 
experimental animals and from mech anistic and other relevant data.  
Group 1: The agent is carcinogenic to humans . 
This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in 
humans. Exceptionally, an agent may be pl aced in this category when evidence of 
carcinogenicity in humans is less than sufficient  but there is sufficient evidence of 
carcinogenicity  in experimental animals and str ong evidence in exposed humans that 
the agent acts through a relevant  mechanism of carcinogenicity.  
Group 2. 
This category includes agents for which, at one extreme, the degree of evidence 
of carcinogenicity in humans is almost sufficient , as well as those for which, at the 
other extreme, there are no human data  but for which there is evidence of  PREAMBLE 35  
 carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Agents are assigned to either Group 2A 
(probably carcinogenic to humans ) or Group 2B ( possibly carcinogenic to humans ) 
on the basis of epidemiological and experi mental evidence of carcinogenicity and 
mechanistic and other relevant data. The terms probably carcinogenic  and possibly 
carcinogenic  have no quantitative si gnificance and are used si mply as descriptors of 
different levels of evidence of  human carcinogenicity, with probably carcinogenic  
signifying a higher level of evidence than possibly carcinogenic . 
Group 2A: The agent is probably carcinogenic to humans . 
This category is used when there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans 
and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental animals. In some cases, an 
agent may be classified in this category when there is  inadequate evidence of 
carcinogenicity  in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental 
animals and strong evidence that the carcino genesis is mediated by a mechanism that 
also operates in humans. Exceptionally, an agent may be classified in this category 
solely on the basis of limited evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans. An agent may be 
assigned to this cat egory if it clearly be longs, based on mechanistic considerations, to 
a class of agents for which one or more members have been classified in Group 1 or Group 2A.  
Group 2B: The agent is possibly carcinogenic to humans . 
This category is used for agents for which there is limited evidence of 
carcinogenicity  in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in 
experimental animals. It may also be used when there is inadequate evidence of 
carcinogenicity  in humans but there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity  in 
experimental animals. In some inst ances, an agent for which there is inadequate 
evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans and less than sufficient evidence of 
carcinogenicity  in experimental animals togeth er with supporti ng evidence from 
mechanistic and other relevant data may be  placed in this group. An agent may be 
classified in this category solely on the basi s of strong evidence from mechanistic and 
other relevant data.  
Group 3: The agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans . 
This category is used most commonly for agents for which the evidence of 
carcinogenicity is inadequate  in humans and inadequate  or limited  in experimental 
animals.  
Exceptionally, agents for which th e evidence of carcinogenicity is 
inadequate  in 
humans but sufficient  in experimental animals may be placed in this category when 
there is strong evidence th at the mechanism of carcin ogenicity in experimental 
animals does not operate in humans.  
Agents that do not fall into any other group are also placed in this category.  36 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 An evaluation in Group 3 is not a determination of non-carcinogenicity or overall 
safety. It often means that further research  is needed, especially when exposures are 
widespread or the cancer data are consistent with differing interpretations.  
Group 4: The agent is probably not carcinogenic to humans . 
This category is used for agents for which there is evidence suggesting lack of 
carcinogenicity  in humans and in experimental animals. In some instances, agents for 
which there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans but evidence 
suggesting lack of carcinogenicity  in experimental animals, consistently and strongly 
supported by a broad range of mechanistic and other relevant data, may be classified 
in this group.  
(e) Rationale 
The reasoning that the Worki ng Group used to reach its evaluation is presented and 
discussed. This section integrates the major fi ndings from studies of cancer in humans, 
studies of cancer in experimental animals, and mechanistic and other relevant data. It 
includes concise statements of the principa l line(s) of argument that emerged, the 
conclusions of the Working Gr oup on the strength of the evidence for each group of 
studies, citations to indicat e which studies were pivotal to these conclusions, and an 
explanation of the reasoning of the Working Group in weighing data and making 
evaluations. When there are significant diffe rences of scientific interpretation among 
Working Group Members, a brief summary of the alternative interpretations is provided, together with their scientific rationale and an indication of the relative degree of support 
for each alternative.

–39– GENERAL REMARKS 
This ninety-ninth volume of the IARC Monographs  contains evaluations of the 
carcinogenic hazard to humans of some ar omatic amines, organic dyes, and related 
occupational or consumer exposures.  Each had been evaluated previously in Volumes 1, 
4, 29, 57, or 77, or in Supplement 7. Newer epidemiological and experimental studies have been published and are reviewed in this volume. As  most of these compounds have 
been associated with bladder tumours in humans  or experimental animals, they are being 
considered at one time with a view toward s determining whether the overall evaluations 
can be improved through consideration of  common mechanisms of carcinogenesis. 
Several studies where hair dyes were applie d to the skin of experimental animals 
would not be considered adequate tests of carcinogenicity by current standards. These 
studies did not involve administ ration at a maximum tolerated concentration, and signs of 
toxicity, reduced body-weight gain, or reduced survival were not often reported. Rather, 
the hair dyes were generally applied at concentrations representative of consumer use. In one set of experiments, the concentration app lied to the animals was diluted to one-tenth 
of the strength of the commercial product as intended for use by  people. These low 
concentrations, coupled with the small numbers of animals tested in some studies, reduce 
the informative value of these experiments and suggest a pressing ne ed for publication of 
proper carcinogenicity studies th at meet current standards. 
A summary of the findings of  this volume appears in The Lancet Oncology  (Baan 
et al. , 2008).

–41– GENERAL DISCUSSION OF COMMON MECHANISMS FOR 
AROMATIC AMINES 
Ever since certain aromatic amines have b een shown to be carcinogenic in humans 
the question has been raised how the chemical structure determines the biological effects, 
because a better understanding of this re lationship could help assess the hazard and the 
risk associated with exposure to these chemi cals. The common denominator is an amino-
group bound to an aromatic system. The chem ical reactivity of this amino group depends 
on the mesomeric interaction with the aromatic system, which is determined by further 
substituents and steric factors (Beland et al. , 1997; Marques et al. , 1997). 
Recent progress in cancer research has rev ealed the complexity of the interaction 
between exogenous exposures and the physiology of an organism. The existing 
knowledge favours the idea that common pr inciples combine the many aromatic amines 
and it might be concluded that most, if not all aromatic amines have a carcinogenic 
potential. The following considerations should help to answer the questions: 
1. Do aromatic amines have generally a carcinogenic potential? 
2. Is there a common mode of action that allows us to draw this conclusion?  
1. Metabolic Activation 
Metabolic activation was the leading con cept to find out how aromatic amines cause 
biological effects. Both acut e and chronic toxicity are held to depend on the metabolic 
activation of the amino group. The key reaction responsible for all the biological activities is the N-oxidation to aryl- N-hydroxylamines. Either the fr ee amine or the acetamide can 
be N-oxidized. Thus an equilibrium exists betw een the two, which is determined by the 
competing activity of N-acetyltransferases and N-deacetylases. Frederick et al.  (1985) 
described the equilibriu m between benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine and N,N´-
diacetylbenzidine in liver slices. The distributi on in this eqilibrium is important, since 
acetylation of the amine to the acetamide is  an inactivating reaction, as is the C-oxidation 
of the aromatic system. Dogs develop more readily bladder tumours with benzidine than 
several other species, because dogs as “non-acetylators” l ack one of the inactivating 
metabolic steps (Lakshmi et al. , 1995). 42 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Both the N-hydroxylamine and the N-hydroxyacetamide may be further activated by 
activating the leaving group through conjugation of the hydroxy group with sulfate or acetate, the sulfate being usually a better mutagen than the acetat e. Eventually, the 
biological activity depends on the bioavailability of a nitrenium ion, an ultimate reactive 
metabolite that reacts with DNA, RNA, and proteins. The ultimate metabolites of most 
arylamines react in vitro  and in vivo  with C-8 of guanine and the respective adduct has 
been made responsible for point mutations.  
The metabolic activation of benzidine is an interesting example that shows the 
complexity that follows from competing metabolic pathways and how these depend on 
the experimental system investigated. Assuming that N-hydroxy-  N,N´-diacetylbenzidine 
(N-OH-DABZ) is a proximate carcinogen, it was us ed as the starting material in in-vitro 
experiments in which the esterification by cy tosolic sulfotransferase to a reactive protein-
binding metabolite could be demonstrated, and it was suggested that this pathway is 
involved in benzidine-in duced carcinogenesis (Morton et al. , 1980). 
Later on, the question was where the activa ting metabolism takes place. Acid-labile 
glucuronides are formed in the liver, which are transported to the bladder. In the acid 
urine they are hydrolysed either to N-acetylbenzidine, which could be activated by 
peroxidases, or to N´-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine, which coul d be further activated for 
instance by O-acetylation. The formation of th e resulting guanine-C-8-adduct was 
explained by the reaction of the nitrenium ion with the intermediary formation of 
benzidine-diimine (Babu et al. , 1992; Zenser et al. , 1998). Already this summary outline 
of activating metabolism shows how many competing steps may be influenced by the 
circumstantial situation, the individual susceptibil ity, nutritional habits, voiding volume, 
dwelling time in the bladder,  etc. It is clear that toxi cokinetics will be influenced by 
species-, tissue- and cell-specific conditions. 
The concept of metabolic activation wa s soon generally accepted as an essential 
prerequisite to explain the biological activit y of an amine and it was expected that once 
the relationships between chemical structur e of the amine and these conditions were 
understood, it would be possible to account for quantitative differences in the level of 
reactive metabolites and explain th e diverse biological effects. 
Other pathways have been proposed, such as the formation of reactive oxygen species 
which are made responsible fo r oxidative DNA damage and mutations induced by, e.g., 
2-naphthylamine (Ohnishi et al. , 2002), 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) and benzidine (Makena 
& Chung, 2007). But this is also a general property of aromatic amine metabolism. 
Human lung chromosomes contain high leve ls of arylamine peroxidase activity which 
readily activates ABP, benzidin e, 4,4´-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), 2-amino-
fluorene (AF) and 2-naphthylamine as m easured by DNA-adduct formation (Culp et al. , 
1997). Prostaglandin H synthase activates N
-acetylbenzidine leading to the typical 
guanine-C-8-acetylbenzidine-adduct (Lakshmi et al. , 1998). Peroxidase-mediated 
activation of aromatic amines can also be demonstrated by activating polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes with tumour promoters. Bindi ng of metabolites to leukocyte DNA has been  COMMON MECHANISMS 43  
 found with benzidine, 2-aminofluorene and methylaminoazobenzene (Tsuruta et al. , 
1985). 
By far the most studies of aromatic amine metabolism were performed with 2-
acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and to a lesser degree with 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) and 2-
aminonaphthalene (AN) and benzidine (BZ), which were among the first chemicals classified as human carcinogens. The ultimate goal of these studies – mostly performed in 
cell and tissue culture and less in vivo  – was to find the critical metabolic pathway and the 
critical biological lesion, primarily in DNA. Many positive correlations were found and many species- and tissue-specific effects of individual arylamines co uld be explained by 
quantitative differences in toxicokinetics rath er than by specific  properties of the 
individual amine. 
The role of metabolic activation for the individual susceptibilit y has particularly 
attracted interest with aromatic amines (Carreón et al. , 2006). One of the first examples 
for an enzymatic polymorphism was the obser vation that workers occupationally exposed 
to benzidine who were slow acetylators were at greater risk to develop bladder tumours 
than rapid acetylators (Golka et al. , 2002; Gu et al. , 2005. Sinués et al. , 1992). This was 
not confirmed in later studies, which incorporated phenotypic and genotypic analysis (Hayes et al. , 1993: Ma et al. , 2004). Similarly, there wa s no overall increase in bladder-
cancer risk in the GSTM1 -null genotype of benzidine-exposed workers (Shinka et al. , 
1998), which is in contrast to its associatio n with elevated bladde r-cancer risk in the 
general population (Rothman et al. , 1996). 
On the other hand, an elevated bladder-can cer risk for formerly benzidine-exposed 
workers in the Chinese dyestuff industry w as associated with a homozygous mutant 
genotype of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7. This polymorphism is different from that 
in Caucasian populations (Lin et al. , 2005). 
In summary, many enzymatic polymorphisms of enzymes involved  in the metabolism 
of aromatic amines are now known and the various equilibria between activating and 
inactivating steps inevitably mu st be influenced by the individual set-up. One of the 
consequences is that epidemiological effects ar e likely to show up only in particularly 
exposed and rather homogeneous populations. 
2. Mechanisms of Carcinogenesis 
The concept of metabolic activation to an ultimate reactive metabolite was clearly 
supported by the finding that c-H- ras, the first oncogene that has been found in normal 
liver as well as in mouse-liver tumours, coul d be activated by a point mutation caused by 
exactly the guanine-C-8-AF addu ct described above (Wiseman et al.  1986). This 
activation was considered an early effect in  the development of liver tumours in the 
mouse (Anderson et al.  1992). In the meantime many proto-oncogenes have been 
identified that are activated and tumour-suppressor genes that are inactivated by genotoxic 44 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 effects. Most activated oncog enes found in human tumours are identical with those found 
in experimental animals. 
Are there DNA-specific effects? Numerous carcinogens produce mutations in typical 
codons, such as 12, 13 and 61 of the H- ras gene, and the corresponding mutations were 
identified in different target tissues, i.e. in human lung and colon, but the pattern of mutations is too different to establish a clear cau se-effect relationship. It is for instance not 
known why mutations of the H- ras gene are seen in mouse-liver tumours, but not in rat-
liver tumours (Bitsch et al. , 1993). They seem to represen t tumour-initiating lesions in 
mouse skin and liver and in rat mammary  tissue (Stanley, 1995). Similar but 
distinguishable mutation profiles were seen with ABP, 2-aminoanthracene and PhIP in 
the lacZ-reversion assay (Garganta et al. , 1999). The selectivity of mutations in the ras 
oncogene in AAF-induced mouse lung and liver tumours was proposed to be tissue-
specific as compared with those in spontaneously occurring mouse lung and liver tumours 
(Wang et al. , 1993). 
Although both AAF and ABP produce the sam e type of DNA-adduct, i.e. dG-C8-AF 
and dG-C8-ABP, the pattern of mutations is different. AAF induces frame-shift and base-
substitution mutations (G-T-t ransversions), ABP only base-substitution mutations (G-A-
transversions). The mutagenic efficiency per adduct is greater with AAF than with ABP 
(Beland et al. , 1990). The dG-8-ABP adducts have been identified in human-bladder 
tumours (Zayas et al. , 2007), in bladder epithelial cells (Skipper & Tannenbaum, 1994), 
and in exfoliated bladder epithelial cells (Talaska et al. , 1993). The adduct levels correlate 
positively with cigarette smoking, type of tobacco and slow-acetylator phenotype. Do 
these results reflect bladder-speci fic or amine-specific effects? 
From the very beginning interest focused on bladder tumours, because they were the 
first to be associated in humans with occupa tional exposure to aromatic amines. But as we 
know now, adduct formation and genotoxic eff ects are not target tissue-specific. The dG-
C8-ABP adduct has been demonstrated in ma ny human tissues, for instance in mammary 
tissue (Faraglia et al. , 2003). 
The formation of dG-C8-ABP adducts correla tes well with the formation of protein 
adducts such as that wi th haemoglobin (Talaska et al. , 1993; Kadlubar et al. , 1991). This 
protein adduct can be measured in blood samples and be used as a biomarker of exposure 
and as a biomarker of effect. It indicates that the N-hydroxylamine (or the nitroso-
derivative) is distributed throughout the organism and in agreement with the general 
experience is available in most if not all tissues. Nukui et al.  (2007) demonstrated the 
transplacental exposure during the pregnancy of smoking mothers. 
The molecular basis by which 4-ABP mediat es carcinogenic activity was believed to 
be its ability to produce mutations in the human genome. However, additional 
mechanisms have come up recently. Bladder can cer is now proposed to be the result of 
gross chromosome aberrations rather  than point mutations (Saletta et al.  2007). Cells 
carrying chromosome instability and microsate llite instability have a selective advantage. 
Exposure to specific carcinogens can select for tumour cells with distinct forms of genetic instability (Bardelli et al. , 2002).  COMMON MECHANISMS 45  
 Despite many open questions the key step s outlined above are basically the same 
(Goodrow, 1996), and the similarities ex ceed the unexplained differences. The same 
metabolic scheme, the same kind of genoto xic lesions and in many cases the same or 
analogous tissue-specificity – like the generation of bladder tumours – support the view 
that the mode of action is the sam e for this whole group of chemicals. 
Moreover, Benigni and Pino (1998) studied tumour profiles (target tissues) of 536 
rodent carcinogens in the four experimental systems usually employed (rat/mouse, 
male/female). Aromatic amines and nitroarenes were among the classes most represented in the database. The authors come to the co nclusion that no obvi ous association exists 
between chemical/mode of action class and tum our profile. It rather appears that each 
class produces tumours at a wide range of sites.  It is suggested that the events surrounding 
the ultimate mechanism of reaction with DNA determine the differences in tumour 
profile. 
Benigni and Passerini (2002) ev aluated several QSAR-models  and conclude d that the 
gradation of potency of aromatic amines depends first on their hydrophobicity, and 
second on electronic properties (reactivity, pr opensity to be metabolically transformed) 
and steric characteristics. Although this regard s some basic properties, it appears not to be 
possible to predict carcinogenicity and pote ncy of an aromatic amine. However, the 
models help to verify the proposed mode of action and in fact support it. 
In summary, a common mode of action is at  the basis of the carcinogenic properties 
of aromatic amines and a carcinogenic poten tial seems to be associated with this whole 
group of chemicals. When and where a tumour will develop depends on the interaction of 
the chemical, with its specific propertie s, in a highly adaptable organism. 
3. The Role of Monocyclic Aromatic Amines 
It was believed for a long time that only the polycyclic aromatic amines, but not the 
monocyclic amines have carcinogenic potential. This conviction was abandoned when 
occupational exposure to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was shown to produce bladder tumours 
in workers. ortho -Toluidine had also to be classified  as a carcinogen and the experimental 
results with aniline eventually put an end to th is hypothesis. With each of a vast variety of 
monocyclic aromatic amines, N-hydroxylamines are metabolically formed under suitable 
conditions, and reactions with DNA and mutagenic activity can be demonstrated 
(Marques et al. , 1997). No criterium can be define d at present that would allow to 
seperate genotoxic from non-genotoxic, or carcinogenic from non-carcinogenic monocyclic arylamines. This is primarily due to results indicating that the role of 
genotoxicity was overestimated. It dominates potential and potency far less than hitherto 
believed. 
This became particularly apparent with the recent developments concerning aniline 
and structurally related amines. The discussio n focused for a long time on the question: is 46 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 aniline a genotoxic carci nogen and if not, should it be classified at all as a carcinogen. 
Tests for mutagenicity gave contradictory results and because of the low genotoxic potency these data were considered not to be sufficient to explain the spleen tumours 
observed in rats (Wilmer et al. , 1984; Bomhard and Herbold, 2005). It was concluded that 
these tumours must be caused by a non-geno toxic mechanism, with  the possibility to 
establish a NOAEL (Bus & Popp, 1987 called it a threshold). It w as hypothesized that 
with increasing doses more damaged erythroc ytes are eliminated in the spleen, which 
causes vascular congestion, pericapsular infl ammation, fibrosis and eventually sarcoma 
and angiosarcoma of the spleen. This would represent a typical high-dose phenomenon. 
In addition it was argued that  spleen tumours in male rats are not relevant for the human 
situation. 
The process starts with the N-oxidation of aniline to N-phenylhydroxylamine in the 
liver. In the erythrocytes, phenylhydroxylamine is then co-oxidized to nitrosobenzene, 
and Fe2+-haemoglobin is oxidized to Fe3+-methaemoglobin. Methaemoglobin has a reduced capacity to bind oxygen and causes a hypoxic situation. Both reactions are 
reversible, nitrosobenzene is reduced back to phenylhydroxylamine and Fe3+ to Fe2+. 
This regenerating process depends largely on the availability of reduced glutathione, 
which keeps methaemoglobin at a tolera ble level. At the work-place only 
methaemoglobin levels of more than  5% are considered adverse. Khan et al. , (1997) 
expected that detrimental effects occur only when the degradation of erythrocytes in the 
spleen is overloaded. One of the hypotheses is  that erythrocyte membranes become less 
plastic and like senescent erythrocytes are sequestered and de graded by the spleen. Iron is 
released in this process (Ciccoli et al. , 1999) which could activate oxygen, which in turn 
modifies cellular DNA. This would be an indirect genotoxic mechanism. At the same 
time lipids and proteins are oxidized an d heme is excessively degraded. All these 
reactions contribute to cytotoxi city. Although iron is also re leased within the erythrocytes 
during methaemoglobin formation, the intravasal degradation of these cells is not thought 
to play a significant role (Pauluhn, 2004). 
The example aniline shows how intimately genotoxic and non-genotoxic effects are 
connected and that genotoxicity al one will not answer the question. 
Is it possible now to close the discussion and decide whether or  not aniline has a 
carcinogenic potential, or more precisely, can a threshold be defined below which it does not contribute to carcinogenic risk? First of all, when metabolic activation and 
bioavailability of reactive metabolites are used  as an end-point, an NEL was not reached 
at low doses in a 4-week study in male rats (Zwirner-Baier et al.  2003). It was, therefore, 
concluded that any exposure to aniline contributes to a background of methaemoglobin 
formation. A variety of endogenous and exog enous chemicals make up this background; 
other aromatic amines are particularly involved. 
In addition to methaemoglobin formation,  erythrocytes are damaged by reactive 
metabolites that react with proteins and memb ranes. Nitrosobenzene, for instance, reacts 
with the SH-groups of  cysteine in the β-chain of haemoglobin. A stable sulfinamide- COMMON MECHANISMS 47  
 adduct is formed, which has been used as a biomarker of effect (Albrecht and Neumann, 
1985, Neumann, 2000, Sarkar et al.  (2006). 
The use of Hb-adducts as biomarkers clearl y demonstrates that the general population 
is exposed to many monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic amines (Bryant et al. , 1987, 
Neumann et al. , 1995). The biomonitoring results ma ke also clear that acute toxicity 
follows the same direction in humans as in  experimental animals. Consequently, any 
quantitative considerations have to take into account additive or synergistic effects for 
most steps within this common mode of action. 
4. The Role of Aromatic Nitrocompounds 
At this point it is necessary to direct the a ttention to the fact that aromatic nitro-
compounds have to be included into the group of chemicals wh ose correct collective 
name is N-substituted aryl compounds. The same N-hydroxylamine is formed by reducing 
the nitrogroup as by oxidizing the amine. These reactions take place at different locations. 
Nitrogroups are reduced to nitrosobenzene pr imarily in the reductive environment of the 
intestine, whereas amines are oxidized predom inantly in liver. The ultimate metabolites 
may therefore be distributed differently. It is interesting to look at corresponding pairs of 
amino- and nitrocompounds, such as aniline and nitrobenzene (Neumann et al., 1995; 
Neumann, 2005). The reactive metabolites – phenylhydroxylamine and nitrosobenzene – 
are identical, the location of tumours in th e rat, however, is different. Aniline causes 
sarcomas predominantly in the spleen, nitrobenzene produces liver adenoma and 
carcinoma in the rat. Both agents acutely produce methaemoglobin and chronic anaemia, 
and liver and kidney damage in rat and mouse. The biological tolerance values for aniline 
and nitrobenzene have therefore been set the same in Germany (DFG 2007; list of MAK 
and BAT values). The relationship between nitroarenes and amines becomes particularly important if it is realized that aromatic nitro-compounds are ubiq uitously present in the 
environment as combustion products. Wherever organic material is combusted not only 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but – in the presence of nitrogen – also polycyclic aromatic nitro-compounds are formed (Neumann, 2001). Already in 1978, Johnson & 
Cornish (1978) studied in rats the conversion of 1- and 2-nitronaphthalene to 1- and 2-
aminonaphthalene. 
5. Genotoxicity Is No t the Only Mechanism 
Soon it became clear that a single mutation was not sufficient to generate a tumour, 
but two or three such critical lesions in combination should be able to control the 
multistep process of tumour formation (Brand au & Böhle, 2001). In the case of large-
bowel tumours up to eight irreversible alterations were postulated. The underlying 48 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 paradigm was that a genotoxic chemical, like an  aromatic amine, is able to transform a 
normal cell into a tumour cell, which gains increasing growth advantage and ultimately grows to a tumour. Numerous types of genotoxic lesions may contribute, chromosome 
instability included. All the knowledge about the spectrum of DNA lesions formed upon 
administration of a single carcinogen as an ini tiator has not yet led to the identification of 
those critical lesions that predispose a cell to the development of neoplasia (Dragan and 
Pitot, 1992). 
Despite many positive correlations between genotoxic lesions and species- and tissue-
specific effects, genotoxic eff ects are necessary but not sufficient to explain the process of 
tumour formation. Early on, observations were reported indicating that pre-neoplastic 
lesions in rat liver were only seen when  carcinogen treatment was coupled with a 
proliferative stimulus, partial hepatectomy being one of the possible triggers (Columbano 
et al. , 1981; Neumann, 1986, Nguyen-Ba & Vasseur, 1999). 
A well known example for non-correlation of genotoxicity and tumour formation 
came from a dose–response st udy, the so-called megamouse experiment. Chronic 
administration of AAF to BALB/c mice prod uced liver as well as bladder tumours. The 
level of the typical guanine-C-8-AF-adduct as the relevant lesion increased linearly with 
dose in both tissues, more so in bladders  than in livers. Tumor incidence however, 
increased linearly only in  livers starting at the level of spontaneous liver tumours. Despite 
the higher adduct levels in bladder, the tum our incidence increased in this tissue steeply 
and nonlinearly only at some higher doses. Th is increase was associat ed with an increase 
in cell proliferation. This means that in dependent of the sign ificantly higher DNA-
damage in the bladder, tumours developed only when cell proliferation was stimulated by the carcinogenic agent. 
In a corresponding experiment with 4-aminobiphenyl, bladder tumours were also 
obtained only with increased cell proliferation.  Adduct levels were 2 to 3 times higher in 
bladder than in liver. In this case the yield of liver tu mours was rather low, which was 
explained by an increased form ation and the transport of N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl- N-
glucuronide from the liver, which led to lower exposures in the liver and higher exposures to the reactive metabolite in th e bladder, where the glucuronid e is hydrolized. This shows 
how pharmacokinetics can modify the genotoxi c effect and how toxicity may determine 
tissue specificity (Poirier et al. , 1995). 
In another example the carcinogenic effects of three polycyclic aromatic amines were 
compared: trans-4-acetylaminostilbene (AAS),  2-acetylaminophenanthrene (AAP), and 2-
acetylaminofluorene (AAF). All three agents pr oduce initiated, i.e. promotable cells in rat 
liver, but only one of them (AAF) produces liver tumours and, therefore, is a complete 
carcinogen for this tissue. A fundamental diffe rence between the three agents is that only 
the complete carcinogen is hepatotoxic. In th is case the adverse effect  could be attributed 
at the molecular level as a non-genotoxic effect. AAF metabolites specifically uncouple 
the mitochondrial respiratory chain by detracting electrons, which opens the 
mitochondrial transition pore and interferes with the regulation of apoptosis (Bitsch et al. ,  COMMON MECHANISMS 49  
 2000). Inhibition of apoptosis may help da maged cells to escape cell death and acquire a 
tumorigenic phenotype (Nguy en-Ba & Vasseur, 1999). 
All three examples show that two different properties were required to make the 
aromatic amine a complete carcinogen: it must be mutagenic and cytotoxic. Other end-
points, like progressive loss of histone H4 lysine 20 trimethylation, and increased histone 
H3 serine 10 phosphorylation, which were detected in rat liver, but not in kidney and 
spleen, indicate clearly the importance of ep igenetic changes in carcinogenesis (Pogribny 
et al. , 2007). 
Among the first authors who proposed a role for toxicity were Radomski et al.  
(1971). 1-Naphthylamine (1-NA) in contrast to the 2-isomer was considered to be non-
carcinogenic, and the rat resistant to the form ation of bladder tumours. In a study that 
compared the two isomers, the isomeric N-hydroxylamines ( N-OH-NA) and their nitroso-
derivatives (NO-N) were tested directly by i.p. injection in rats, and both oxidation 
products produced tumours (fibromas, fibrosar coma and lymphosarcomas), but they also 
turned out to be hepatotoxic, such that the survival time w as significantly reduced.. Both, 
1-NOH-NA and 1-NO-N were more carcinogenic than the 2-isomers, and both gave the 
same type of tumours. When administered  to newborne mice, it was the other way 
around: 2-NOH-NA was more carcinogeni c than 1-NOH-NA, and 2-NOH-N more 
efficient than 2-NO-N. The original tes ting for carcinogenicity of the amines was 
evidently insufficient and both isomers have carcinogenic potential under suitable conditions. It also shows that the rat is no t completely resistant to oral doses of 2-NA 
(Hicks et al.  1982). Toxicity has strongly influenc ed the outcome of the test results. The 
promoting effects of AAF have often been used in models of carcinogenicity testing and undefined toxicity was made responsible for this effect (Sparfel et al. , 2002). 
6. Conclusions 
The study of carcinogenic N-substituted aryl compounds, a large group of chemicals 
not only present at many workplaces but also in the general environment, teaches us an 
important lesson. If suitable conditions are chosen it is possible to demonstrate, with 
practically all of them, the formation of ul timate metabolites, their reaction with DNA, 
RNA and proteins, mutagenic activity, the formation of methaemoglobin and other acute toxic effects. Only in a few cases has it been po ssible so far to prove a causal relationship 
in humans, sufficient to classify  the agent in IARC's Group 1. 
What kind of information would be nec essary to label an agent as hazardous to 
humans? It appears impossible to exclude the su spicion of a carcinogenic potential for this 
type of chemical. Together with the fact that many of these N-substituted chemicals are 
present in the environment and due to their common mode of action, additive or synergistic effects have to be expected. Tu mour-promoting effects have been seen with 50 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 mixtures in which the level of most of the in dividual chemicals was below that expected 
to have such an effect (Crisp database, Benjamin, 2010).

–55– GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE CHEMISTRY OF DYES 
1. Principles of Colour Chemistry 
1.1 Basis for colour 
Unlike most organic compounds, dyes possess colour because they 1)  absorb light in 
the visible spectrum (400–700 nm), 2) have  at least one chromo phore (colour-bearing 
group), 3) have a conjugated system, i.e. a structure with alternating double and single 
bonds, and 4) exhibit resonance of electron s, which is a stabilizing force in organic 
compounds (Abrahart, 1977). When any one  of these features is lacking from the 
molecular structure the colour is lost. In addi tion to chromophores, most dyes also contain 
groups known as auxochromes  (colour helpers), examples of which are carboxylic acid, 
sulfonic acid, amino, and h ydroxyl groups. While these are not responsible for colour, 
their presence can shift th e colour of a colourant and they are most often used to influence 
dye solubility. Figure 1 shows the relationships between wavele ngth of visible and colour 
absorbed/observed. Other factors contributing to colour are illustrated in Figures 2–4.

Regarding the requirement of a chromophore generating colour in organic 
compounds, it is important to note that th e chromophore must be part of a conjugated 
system. This is illustrated through the exam ples in Figure 5 where it can be seen that 
placement of an azo group between methyl  groups produces a co lourless compound, 
while a yellow-orange colour is obtained when the azo group is placed between aromatic rings. Similarly, the structures in Figure 3 demonstrate the importance of having an 
extended conjugated system. It is evident that doubling the length of the conjugated  CHEMISTRY OF DYES 57  
 system in Vitamin A to give β-carotene causes a significant bathochromic shift, i.e. to a 
darker colour.

In addition to influencing solubility, auxochro mes are essential ring substituents in 
providing target colours. This is illustrated in Figure 6, where the following effects of 
substituents are shown: 
• Adding groups of increasing electron-donating ability to the azobenzene 
structure has a bathochromic effect ( cf. OH vs NH 2). 
• Electron-donating (NH 2) and electron-accepting (NO 2) groups placed in 
conjugation provide a bathochromic effect. In this regard, nitro groups are especially beneficial, contri buting to their prevalence in disperse dye structures. 
• Increasing the number of electron-attracting groups conjugated with the 
electron-donor has a bathochromic effect. 
• The electron-donating effects of an am ino group are enhanced by adding alkyl 
groups to the N-atom.

1.2 Dyes versus Pigments 
With regard to their solubility, organic colourants fall into two classes, viz. dyes and 
pigments (Allen 1971). The key distinction is  that dyes are soluble in water and/or an 
organic solvent, while pigments are insoluble  in both types of liqu id media. Dyes are used 
to colour substrates to which they have affinity. Pigments can be used to colour any 58 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 polymeric substrate but by a mechanism quite di fferent from that of dyes, in that surface-
only colouration is involved unless the pigment is mixed with the polymer before fibre or moulded article formation. 
2. Considerations in Dye Design 
2.1 Dye-substrate affinity 
Dyes containing one or more azo groups (i.e . azo dyes) comprise by far the largest 
family of organic dyes. Prominent types are 1) acid dyes for polyamide and protein 
substrates such as nylon, wool, and silk; 2)  disperse dyes for hydrophobic substrates such 
as polyester and acetate, and 3) direct and r eactive dyes for cellulosic substrates such as 
cotton, rayon, linen, and paper. Generally, th e synthesis of azo dyes involves two steps. 
Step 1 is the conversion of an aromatic  amine to a diazo compound (i.e. Ar-NH2 → Ar-
N2+), a process known as diazotization, and st ep 2 is the reaction of the diazo compound 
with a phenol, naphthol, aromatic amine, or a compound that has an active methylene 
group, to produce the correspond ing azo dye, a process known as diazo coupling (e.g. Ar- 
N2+ + Ar’-OH → Ar-N=N-Ar’-OH). This process is su itable for forming both azo dyes 
and pigments. Typical structures of colourants that fall into the two groups are shown in 
Figure 7.  
Since the effectiveness of a dyeing or prin ting process often hing es on the affinity 
between the dye and substrate, dyes are designed  with a specific substr ate in mind. In this 
regard, dyes must be designed that have a) greater affinity for the substrate than the 
medium (usually water) from which it is applied and b) a high degree of permanence under end-use conditions (e.g. stability to fading upon exposures to water (wet fast) 
and/or sunlight (light fast)) . The following is a summary of  the types of considerations 
associated with the development of dyes for polymeric (especial ly fibre-based) substrates 
(Aspland, 1997). The availability of colourants for a specific substrate type is the result of 
a deliberate molecular design process that  takes the target substrate and end-use 
application into consideration. 
2.1.1  Dyes for polyesters 
Dyes developed for polyesters are known  as disperse dyes. In this case, the 
mechanism of coloration involves  “dissolving” the dye in the polymer matrix to form a 
solid–solid solution. Taking ad vantage of the well known prin ciple that “like dissolves 
like”, disperse dyes are designed that are hydr ophobic in nature. Such  colourants are very 
sparingly soluble in water and derive their name from the fact that they are dispersed 
rather than fully dissolved in water to carry  out the dyeing process . An example is C.I. 
Disperse Blue 165 (Figure 7). Disperse dyes have no affinity for hydrophilic polymers  CHEMISTRY OF DYES 59  
 such as cellulose, which makes them unsuita ble for colouring cott on, cellophane, and 
paper, but quite suitable for poly(ethylen e terephthalate) an d cellulose acetate.

2.1.2  Dyes for polyamides and proteins 
Dyes for these substrates normally form i onic bonds (Fig. 8) within the polymer 
matrix. In this case dyes bearing a negative (anionic) charge are used because polyamides 
such as nylon and proteins such as wool, si lk, and leather carry a positive (cationic) 
charge – especially during th e dyeing process. Anionic dyes  for polyamide and protein 
substrates are known as acid dyes , an example of which is C.I. Acid Black 1 (Fig. 9). 
They derive their name from the fact that they  are typically applied to suitable substrates 
from a medium containing acid. These dyes ha ve little to no affi nity for polyester, 
cellulosic, or cationic polymers, since such substrates cannot form an ionic bond with 
them.

2.1.3  Dyes for cationic polymers 
Dyes for these substrates also form ionic bo nds within the polyme r matrix. In this 
case, dyes bearing a positive (cationic) char ge are used because polymers such as 
poly(acrylonitrile) carry a negative (anionic) charge in their backbone, making the ionic 
character of the interacting su bstances the reverse of that described above for acid dyes. 
Cationic dyes for acrylic substrates were initially known as basic dyes , an example of 
which is C.I. Basic Red 18 (Figure 9). Today, they derive their name from the fact that 
they possess a cationic group. These dyes have no affinity for poly ester, cellulosic, or 
polyamide polymers, since such substrat es cannot form an ionic bond with them. 
However, cationic dyes can be used to dye prot ein fibres and, in fact, the first synthetic 
dye Mauveine was a basic dye that was used for dyeing silk. This takes advantage of the 
presence of carboxylate (–CO 2-) groups in silk and wool. 
2.1.4  Dyes for cellulosic polymers 
Cellulosic substrates include co tton, rayon, cellophane, linen, and paper, all of which 
are very hydrophilic and, therefore, require  hydrophilic (water so luble) dyes for their 
coloration from a dyebath. In addition, dyes mu st be designed that maintain affinity when 
the substrate is exposed to wate r. This allows the colour to remain on the substrate, when, 
for instance, a cotton fabric is laundered or a cup of coffee is inadvertently spilled on a 
sheet of paper containing pr inted information. The ease with  which cellulosic substrates 
such as cotton swell and lose colourants during laundering has led to the design and 
development of more dye colourant families for cellulosic fibres than any other substrate. 
Dyes designed for cellulosic polymers are di rect, azoic, vat, sulfur, and reactive dyes. 
Direct dyes  are so named because they were the fi rst colourants that had affinity for 
cotton in the absence of a binding agent known as a mord ant. Because these dyes are 
water-soluble, many have low wet fastness. Figure 10 illustrates two key properties of 
benzidine-based direct dyes, viz. 1) they tend to be linear mo lecules, and 2) they are able 
to gain close proximity to th e cellulose chain, to maximize the effects of intermolecular 
interactions such as H-bonding.  
To enhance wet fastness on cellulosic fibres, methods were developed to apply water-
insoluble dyes to cotton. Such  dyes include those that are ei ther water insoluble in their  CHEMISTRY OF DYES 61  
 natural form or synthesized inside the poly mer matrix as a water-insoluble dye. The idea 
is that placing a water-insoluble dye within  the polymer matrix would prevent colour 
removal upon exposure of the substrate to wate r. In turn, this led to the development of 
vat dyes  and sulfur dyes  (Figure 11a,b). Vat dyes owe th eir name to the vatting process 
associated with their applicati on, while sulfur dyes are so named because of the essential 
use of sulfur in their synthesis. The structur es of vat dyes are rather well known but sulfur 
dye structures are less well defined, b ecause their polymeric nature makes them 
unsuitable for standard methods for structure characterization. In their application, vat and sulfur dyes are converted to a water-soluble form that has a ffinity for cellulose and are 
subsequently converted back to their water-insoluble form, giving good permanence 
under wet conditions. Included in the family of vat dyes is the well known natural dye indigo . While indigo is still the most important colourant for denim fabric, its a-typically 
small size causes this vat dye to be very su sceptible to removal in  a laundering process, 
giving jeans a faded appearan ce even after one wash. This underscores the importance of 
designing colourants fo r cellulosic substrates that possess th e features required for them to 
remain within the polymer matrix when water swells the substrate.

Azoic colourants (cf. Figure 11c) are al so known as naphthol dyes because naphthol 
compounds are used in their synthesis. Th ese dyes do not exist per se, but they are 
generated inside the polymer matrix by applying the two necessary components to the 
substrate separately. Following their applicatio n to the substrate, the two components find 
each other and combine to form a water-insoluble colourant. 
The final class of suitable colouran ts for cellulosic fibres is known as reactive dyes  
(cf. Figure 11d). They derive their name fro m the fact that they undergo a chemical 
reaction with cellulose to form a covalent bond (Figure 12). React ive dyes opened the 
door to bright wet-fast shades on cellulosic fibres that were not previously attainable. 62 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

2.2 Toxicological considerations 
While dye–substrate affinity is critical, synthetic dyes cannot be commercialized 
unless they pose little health risk under end- use conditions. Conse quently, environmental 
safety is an essential consideration in molecula r design. In this regard, the raw materials 
employed in the manufacture of synthetic dyes should not involve compounds known to 
pose health risks. This would include a large group of aromatic amines (Anon, 1996) that 
are either cancer-suspect agents or established mutagens in the standard Salmonella  
mutagenicity assay (Maron and Ames, 1983). It is  clear, therefore, th at dye design must 
take into consideration the likely genotoxicity of the potential metabolites generated in mammalian systems (Prival et al. , 1984). In the case of azo dyes, the enzyme-mediated 
formation of genotoxic aromatic amines as me tabolites must be considered, since it is 
possible that the intact dye is safe but not all of its metabolites. For instance, the use of  CHEMISTRY OF DYES 63  
 dye 1 in Figure 13 could lead to the formation of the bladder carcinogen benzidine if this 
dye were taken up in the body.

2.2.1  Structure–Property Relationships 
Following the recognition that certain arom atic amines used in azo-dye synthesis 
caused bladder cancer, a wide variety of chemi cals were evaluated in animal studies, and 
the results showed that aromatic amines and azo compounds of the type shown in Figure 14 were carcinogenic (Weisburger, 1978). In this regard, it is generally believed 
that the ultimate carcinogen arises from the metabolic conversion of these compounds to 
electrophilic species ( cf. Figure 15) that inte ract with electron-rich sites in DNA to cause 
DNA adducts, mutations and subsequent adverse effects on the cell. It is also clear that 
ring substituents that enhance the hydropho bic character increase carcinogenic potential: 
this is the case when adding a methyl group to 2-naphthylamine ( 2; R = H) or meta -
phenylenediamine ( cf. analogue 4). 
As a follow-up to the study pertaining to carcinogenicity data assessment (Longstaff, 
1983), correlations between dye structure and carcinogenicity data were established. In a 
comparison of hydrophobic azo dyes containing amino groups in the para- or ortho -
position, it was found that the para-isomers were carcinogenic while the ortho -isomers 
were not. To account for the se results, the chemistry in Figu re 16 was proposed (Gregory, 
1986). It is believed that the isomeric arylazo amines produce nitrenium ions ( 9) that 
either interact with DNA ( para-isomer) or undergo intramolecular cyclization ( ortho -
isomer) to produce adducts ( 10) or benzotriazoles ( 11), respectively. 64 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

A correlation of carcinogenicity data with the structures of hydrophilic azo dyes was 
also presented (Gregory, 1986). Water-soluble dyes of type 12 were carcinogenic, while 
type 13 dyes (Fig. 17) were not. In this case, th e nature of the reductive-cleavage products  CHEMISTRY OF DYES 65  
 was the determining factor in the ob served carcinogenicity data. Whereas dye 12 
produces a lipophilic amine (2 ,4,5-trimethylaniline), dye 13 produces water-soluble 
sulfonated amines only, making aromatic amin e genotoxicity an important consideration 
in azo-dye design.

3. Hair Dyes 
A great majority of the dyes used in hair colouring are known as oxidation hair dyes 
(Corbett, 1985, 2000). A much smaller number of  the commercial hair dyes are synthetic 
dyes that have affinity for protein substrat es such as wool. Oxidation dyes, the more 
permanent of the two groups, are produced directly on the hair by oxidizing aromatic 
diamines such as para-phenylenediamine or 2,5-diaminotoluene with an oxidizing agent. 
Suitable diamines have been referred to as “primary intermediat es” and the oxidizing 
agents (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) as “develop ers.” Other useful primary intermediates are 
aminodiphenylamines, aminomethylphenols, and para-aminophenol. 
When used alone, the primary intermed iates provide a very limited shade-range 
following their oxidation on hair. To enhance the range of available hair colours, the 
primary intermediates are oxidized in the pr esence of suitable “couplers.” While most 
couplers do not produce colours when exposed to developers alone, they give a wide 
range of shades on hair when applied in combination with primary intermediates. 
Appropriate couplers include 3-aminophenol, resorcinol, and α-naphthol. 
The chemistry associated with the oxidat ion of primary intermediates is now 
reasonably well known. For para-phenylenediamine and para-aminophenol ( cf. 14), 
oxidation-induced self-coupling proceeds via the pr ocess outlined in Fig. 18, where it can 
be seen that permanent hair-dye formation i nvolves oxidation followed by coupling to 
give type- 15 structures. Fig. 19 provides chemistry representative of combinations arising 
from joining an α-naphthol-based coupler ( 16) and a sulfonated N-phenyl- para-
phenylenediamine primary intermediate ( 17) to produce experimental dyes 18 and 19. 
This chemistry also illustrates the fact that  oxidation dyes are often mixtures rather than 
single products. 66 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 An analytical method has been developed for characterizing the reactants and reaction 
products of oxidative hair-dye formulations. The results indicated that a significant amount, i.e. ≈20% or more of the initial concentrations of precursor(s) and coupler(s), is 
always present in the formulation that is not diffused into hairs (see Section 1 of the 
Monograph on hair dyes in this volume).

been used in colour refreshen er shampoos and conditioners. Similarly, C.I. Acid dyes 
such as Yellow 3, Orange 7, Red 33, Violet 43, and Blue 9 have been used in shampoos, 
in this case to deliver highli ghting effects (Corbett, 2000 ). Example structures of non-
permanent hair dyes are provided in Fig. 20 , where it can be seen that these dyes are 
drawn from those known to have affinity for protein-based textile fibres.  CHEMISTRY OF DYES 67

 1.1.5  Analysis 
The first analytical studies on 4-aminob iphenyl were reported during the 1960s. 
Method developments have enabled the detection of 4-aminobiphenyl at extremely low 
concentrations, down to the picogram level. GC/MS on derivatized samples and LC/MS on non-derivatized samples are most often us ed. Table 1.1 presents a selection of recent 
studies of the analysis of 4-am inobiphenyl in various matrices. 
1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
Because of its carcinogenic effects, 4- aminobiphenyl has no t been produced 
commercially in the USA since the mid-1950s (Koss et al. , 1969). It was present in the 
drug and cosmetic colour additive D&C Yellow No. 1; however, use of this colour 
additive was discontinued in the late 1970s. 4-Aminobiphenyl also has been reported as a contaminant in diphenylamin e (NTP, 2005; HSDB, 2009). 
Available information indicates that 4-aminobiphenyl was produced and/or supplied 
in research quantities in the following countries: China, Germany, Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, India, Switzerland, and the USA (Chemical Sources International, 
2008). 
1.2.2  Use 
4-Aminobiphenyl has been  used formerly as a ru bber antioxidant. It is reportedly still 
used in the detection of sulfates and as a m odel carcinogen in mutagenicity studies and 
cancer research (O’Neil, 2006). 
1.3 Occurrence and exposure 
1.3.1  Natural occurrence 
4-Aminobiphenyl is not known to occur in nature. 
1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
Historically, occupational exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl mainly occurred during its 
production and its use as a rubber antioxidant and dye intermediate. No exposure measurements are available for these o ccupational exposure situations. 
Occupational exposure can also occur in workers exposed to pr oducts contaminated 
with 4-aminobiphenyl, or in workers expos ed to benzidine and benzidine-based dyes, 
from which 4-aminobiphenyl can be metabolically released (Lakshmi et al. , 2003; 
Beyerbach et al. , 2006). Other circumstances with potential exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl   4-AMINOBIPHENYL 73

 include exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Hammond et al.  1995), and exposure 
of laboratory workers working with 4-aminobip henyl as a model in cancer research or for 
the detection of sulfate ions. 
In workers exposed to benzidine or to  benzidine-based dyes and a non-exposed 
control group in a dye factory in India, ur ine samples were analysed  for 4-aminobiphenyl 
and acetylated 4-aminobiphenyl (Ac4ABP) . 4-Aminobiphenyl was found in 30 of 
33 urine samples from exposed workers (mean, 109 pmol/mL) and one of the 13 control 
workers. The benzidine-exposed workers had significantly higher 4-aminobiphenyl levels (57 pmol/mL) than did the benzidine-based dye-exposed workers (29.3 pmol/mL). In the 
sample that belonged to the person with the highest 4-aminobiphenyl concentration, 
acetylated 4-aminobiphenyl was found at a concentration of 79.5 pmol/mL, while it was 
not detected in any of the other urine samples (Beyerbach et al. , 2006). 
1.3.3  Environmental occurrence and exposure of the general population 
The main sources of exposure to 4-aminob iphenyl for the general population are 
cigarette smoking and environmental tob acco smoke. Other potential sources include 
emissions from cooking oils, hair dyes, an d food and other dyes contaminated with it. 
Living near benzidine-contam inated sites could entail ex posure to 4-aminobiphenyl, 
as benzidine in the environment can be degrad ed to 4-aminobiphenyl by bacterial action 
(Bafana et al. , 2007). 
(a) Occurrence in tobacco smo ke and fumes from cooking oils 
4-Aminobiphenyl is formed during tobacco  combustion. Mainstream cigarette smoke 
was reported to contain 4-aminobiphenyl at levels of 2.4–4.6 ng per cigarette without a filter and 0.2–23 ng per cigarette with a filter ; sidestream smoke contains up to 140 ng per 
cigarette (Patrianakos & Hoffmann 1979; Hoffmann et al. , 1997). A non-smoker exposed 
to environmental tobacco smoke during one month can ingest as much 4-aminobiphenyl 
as by smoking 17 cigarettes (Hammond et al., 1995) 
4-Aminobiphenyl has also been detected in  emissions from cooking oils. In a study 
from Taiwan, China, concentrations of 4-aminobiphenyl were 35.7 µg/m
3 in emissions 
from sunflower oil, 26.4 μ/m3 from vegetable oil and 23.3 µg/m3 from refined-lard oil 
(Chiang et al. , 1999). 
(b) Occurrence as a contaminant 
4-Aminobiphenyl can occur as contaminant in 2-aminobiphenyl, which is used in the 
manufacture of dyes. 4-Aminobiphenyl has also be en detected in aniline (Reilly, 1967), in 
the drug and cosmetic colou r-additive D&C Yellow No. 1 (H SDB, 2009) and in the food 
dye FD&C Yellow No. 6 (Richfield-Fratz et al. , 1985). 4-Aminobiphenyl also has been 
reported as a contaminant in diphenylamine , a fungicide used on apples (Olek, 1988). 
4-Aminobiphenyl has been detected in hair  dyes. In a study from the USA, Turesky 
et al.  (2003) found 4-aminobiphenyl in eight of 11 different oxidative and direct hair 76 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 dyes, with levels of 4-ABP ranging from non-detectable (< 0.29 ppb) to 12.8 ppb. 
4-Aminobiphenyl was found in blonde, red, and black, but not in brown dyes. The same study reported that research-grade 1,4-phen ylenediamine (PPD), a key constituent for 
colour development of many permanent hair dyes, can be contaminated with 
4-aminobiphenyl in concentrations up to 500 ppb. In a study from Turkey (Akyüz & Ata, 2008), 4-aminobiphenyl was found in concentrations up to 8.12 µg/g in 28 of the 54 hair-
dye samples, up to 2.23 µg/g in 11 of 25 henna samples, and up to 2.87 µg/g in four of 
10 commercial natural henna samples tested. 
1,4-Phenylenediamine is manufactured by use of three methods: (1) reduction of 
para-nitroaniline, (2) diazotization of aniline, or (3) direct nitration of benzene without 
chlorinating. The major manufacturer of 1,4-phenylenediamine in the USA produces this chemical for use in hair dyes via the third process; it is > 99% pure. 
1.4 Regulations and guidelines 
1.4.1  Europe 
(a) Council Directive 89/677/EEC 
According to Council Directive 89/677/EEC, 4-aminobiphenyl may not be sold to the 
general public. The packaging shall be legible and indelibly marked as follows: “Restricted to professional users” (E uropean Economic Community, 1989). 
(b) Directive 98/24/EC 
According to EU legislation, the manufacture of 4-aminobiphenyl has been prohibited 
since 1998 (European Commission, 1998). The Council Directive 98/24/EC in Annex III 
prohibits the production, manufacture or use at  work of 4-aminobiphenyl and its salts and 
activities involving 4-aminobiphenyl and it s salts. The prohibition does not apply if 
4-aminobiphenyl and its salts are present in anot her chemical agent, or as a constituent of 
waste, provided that its concentrat ion therein is less than 0.1% w/w. 
(c) Directive 2002/61/EC 
Directive 2002/61/EC restricts the marketing and use of azo-colourants (European 
Commission, 2002). In this Directive, A nnex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is amended. 
Azodyes which, by reductive cleavage of one or more azo groups may release 4-aminobiphenyl in detectable concentrations, i.e. above 30 ppm in the finished articles or 
in the dyed parts thereof, ac cording to the testing method  established in accordance with 
Article 2a of this Directive, may not be used in textile and leather articles that may come into direct and prolonged contact wi th the human skin or oral cavity.  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 77  
 (d) Directive 2004/37/EC 
4-Aminobiphenyl is regulated by the Di rective 2004/37/EC (European Commission, 
2004a), which applies to activities in which workers are exposed to carcinogens or mutagens of Category 1 and 2. Rules are fixed regarding the employers' obligations of 
reduction and replacement, prevention and re duction of exposure, unforeseen exposure, 
foreseeable exposure, access to risk areas, hygien e and individual prot ection, information 
for the competent authority, information and training of  workers, consultation and 
participation of workers, health surveillance, record keeping and limit values. 
(e) Cosmetics Directive 
The Commission Directive 2004/93/EC of 21 September 2004 amends Council 
Directive 76/768/EEC for the purpose of adap ting Annexes II and III thereto to technical 
progress (European Commission, 2004b). In this Directive, biphenyl-4-ylamine (i.e. 4-
aminobiphenyl) and its salts are listed in Annex II as substances that must not form part of 
the composition of cosmetic products. 
1.4.2  Japan 
The Japan Society for Occupational Health  (2007) follows the classification by IARC 
of 4-aminobiphenyl in Group 1 (IARC, 1987). 
1.4.3  Germany 
4-Aminobiphenyl is classified as a Catego ry-1 carcinogen by the MAK Commission. 
The MAK Commission listed 4-aminobiphenyl as a substance for which percutaneous 
absorption may signifi cantly contribute to systemic ex posure. A MAK value was not set. 
A biological tolerance value (BAT) was set at 10.0 ng/L in blood , released from the 
4-aminobiphenyl-haemoglobin-adduct (MAK, 2007). 
1.4.4  USA 
(a) ACGIH 
4-Aminobiphenyl has been assigned an A1 notation, Confirmed Human Carcinogen  
(ACGIH, 2001). Accordingly, a numerical TLV (threshold limit value) is not 
recommended for occupational exposure. A ‘Skin notation’ is recommended ( potential 
significant contribution to the o verall exposure by the cutaneous route ) as an additional 
precaution for undue exposure. As for all substances designated as A1 carcinogens 
without a TLV, workers should be properly equipped to eliminate all exposure to 4-aminodiphenyl to the fullest extent possible. 78 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 (b) NIOSH 
The National Institute for Occupational Safe ty and Health lists 4-aminobiphenyl as 
one of thirteen OSHA-regulated carcinogens. Exposures of workers are to be controlled 
through the required use of engineering cont rols, work practices, and personal protective 
equipment, including respirators (NIOSH, 2005). 
(c) FDA 
FDA has set limits for 4-aminobiphenyl fo r the following certified colours (FDA, 
1985, 1986, 1988): FD&C Yellow No. 5: ≤ 5 ppb; FD&C Yellow No. 6: ≤ 15 ppb; D&C 
Red No. 33: ≤ 275 ppb (FDA, 2009). 
(d) NTP 
4-Aminobiphenyl is listed in the NTP Report on Carcinogens as known to be a human 
carcinogen  (NTP, 2005). 
1.4.5  Other 
(a) GESTIS 
Table 1.2 presents some international limit values for 4-aminobiphenyl (GESTIS,

 2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
2.1 Descriptive studies 
In a case series, Melick et al.  (1955) reported 19 cases of bladder cancer in 171 
(11.1%) male workers engaged in the production of 4-aminobiphenyl. The exposure took 
place in a chemical plant in the USA between  1935 and 1955. In a later follow-up study, 
it was reported that among 315 male work ers exposed to 4-aminobiphenyl, 53 had 
developed bladder tumours. The interval until development of bladder cancer varied from 
15 to 35 years after beginning of the exposure (Melick et al. , 1971). 
2.2 Cohort studies 
Following the cessation of indus trial production of 4-ami nobiphenyl in 1955 in the 
USA, a large surveillan ce programme was started on worker s reportedly exposed to this 
chemical. In the first study, a total of 601 specimens of urinary sediment from 285 men 
exposed to 4-aminobiphenyl were examined for cytological features. Among these men, 
31 were found to have significantly abnormal epithelial cells in urinary sediments, of whom 10 were diagnosed with histological ly confirmed bladder carcinoma (Melamed et 
al., 1960). A later follow-up study was undertaken of the 22 patients whose urinary 
sediment in 1960 contained suspicious or frankly malignant cells, but did not have evidence of clinical bladder can cer. The study provided complete data on 18 patients, 11 
of whom developed histologically confirmed carcinoma of the bladder (Koss et al. , 1965). 
In a third follow-up of this screening study, now extended to 503 male workers exposed 
to 4-aminobiphenyl, 35 workers developed histologically confirmed bladder cancer (Koss 
et al. , 1969). In a further extension, a group of 541 workers exposed to 4-aminobiphenyl 
were examined for abnormalities in cytolo gic specimens over a maximum period of 14 
years. Among 86 men who had suspicious or positive cytology, 43 developed 
histologically confirmed carcinoma of the bladder (Melamed 1972). 
Cancer mortality was studied among 884 male workers at the Nitro chemical plant in 
West Virginia (USA), which produced a va riety of chemicals (Zack & Gaffey 1983). A 
ten-fold increase in mortalit y from bladder cancer was repo rted, with nine cases observed 
and 0.91 expected ov er the period 1955–1977. All nine  cases started work in the plant 
before 1949; 4-aminobiphenyl was used in the plant from 1941 until 1952. 
An updated and enlarged cohort study was conducted among workers at the same 
rubber chemicals plant in Nitro, West Virginia (USA) (Collins et al. , 1999). The aim of 
the study was to investigate any bladder can cer risk from exposure to 2-mercapto-
benzothiazole (MBT). As 4-aminobiphenyl was shipped to the Nitro plant during 1935–
1955 and used to produce a rubber antioxida nt, MBT-exposed workers also had potential 
exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl. Exposure during the 20 years of manufacturing was limited 
to a few areas, e.g. where samples were take n for analysis, where distillation residues 80 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 were removed and where leaks occurred. The greatest exposure was found where workers 
were involved in repair of equipment and in cleaning-up of accidental leaks. As no 
information was available to determine which workers were involved in the clean-up of 4-
aminobiphenyl, workers were considered to be exposed if they had a job in the 
department where 4-aminobiphenyl was used or were considered to have potential exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl if they were employed between 1935 and 1955, the years 
during which this chemical was used in the plant. The study examined the mortality of 
1059 full-time white male hourly production workers employed at the rubber chemicals 
plant between 1955 and 1977; 600 of these workers were exposed to MBT. Follow-up 
was from 1955 to 1996. SMRs were computed  by use of mortality rates for the white 
male population in the four counties in West Virginia within a 20-mile radius of the plant. For all study subjects, the SM Rs for lung cancer, prostate cancer and other cancer sites 
were at expected levels. However, rates for bladder cancer were highly elevated in the 
total cohort (16 deaths, SMR, 6.3; 95% CI: 3.6–10.3), and in the subcohort of workers with exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl (eight deaths, SMR 27.1, 95% CI: 11.7–53.8). There 
was no excess of leukaemia, based on four  deaths (SMR, 1.0; 95% CI: 0.3–2.6). 
Cigarette smoking is an established cause of bladder cancer, and aminobiphenyls 
have been implicated in bladder-cancer etiology in smokers (IARC, 2004). Haemoglobin 
adducts of 4-aminobiphenyl are considered to be valid biomarkers of the internal dose of 
aminobiphenyl to the bladder (Probst-Hensch et al. , 2000). However, these biomarker 
studies have not been able to disentangle the role of 4-aminobiphenyl compared with 
other bladder carcinogens in tobacco smoke. Th erefore, studies of tobacco smokers and 
bladder cancer are not reviewed here; the read er is referred to the Monograph on tobacco 
smoke (IARC, 2004). 
3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
3.1 Oral administration 
3.1.1  Mouse 
A group of Ab × IF F 1 male and female hybrid mice, 10 weeks of age, were given 
commercial 4-aminobiphenyl (source and purity not stated) by gavage (0.2 mL of a 0.25% solution in arachis oil) twice weekly for 9 months. The estimated total intake was 
38 mg per animal. Two of 12 mice surviving to 90 weeks developed bladder carcinoma. 
[The Working Group assumed there were none in 38 control animals.] Hepatomas were 
found both in treated animals and cont rols in similar frequencies (Clayson et al. , l965). 
A group of C57 × IF F
1 male and female hybrid mice,  12 weeks of age, received 
4-aminobiphenyl (Koch-Light Laboratories Ltd; purity not stated) by gavage (0.2 mL of a 0.25% solution in arachis oil) three times pe r week for 50 weeks. The estimated total 
intake was 75 mg per animal. The mice were killed approximately 20 weeks after the end  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 81  
 of the treatment. Thirteen of 28 (46%) female and four of 21 (19%) male mice had 
malignant liver tumours. One male mouse had a bladder carcinoma. In 50 control mice, one benign hepatoma was observed (Clayson et al. , 1967). 
Groups of 840 male and 840 female BALB/cStCrlfC3Hf/Nctr mice from the NCTR 
breeding colony, four weeks of age, were given 4-aminobiphenyl-HCl (purity, > 99.5%) in the drinking-water at doses of 0, 7, 14, 28, 55, 110, and 220 ppm (males) and 0, 7, 19, 
38, 75, 150, and 300 ppm (fe males). The 220-ppm and 300 -ppm doses for one week 
corresponded to the LD
50 (in mg/kg bw given by gavage) for male and female mice, 
respectively. Necropsies were performed at 13, 26, 39, 52, and 96 weeks, on 
approximately 45 organs and tissues of each  animal. Induction of angiosarcomas (all 
sites), hepatocellular tumours and bladder car cinomas were dose-related (see Table 3.1) 
(Schieferstein et al. , 1985).

3.1.2  Rabbit 
Seven rabbits (strain unspecified) were give n 4-aminobiphenyl (source and purity not 
stated) orally (dose and dose regimen not given) to the limit of tolerance, and the 
treatment was continued until the onset of the final illness. Three animals were sacrificed 
in the first two years and two each between three and four years and between five and six 
years after the start of treatment. Bladder carcinomas were observed in three rabbits, the 82 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 earliest after four years of treatment. No tum ours were observed in twelve control rabbits 
[no statistical analysis w as provided] (Bonser, 1962). 
3.1.3  Dog 
Two male Beagle dogs, seven months of age, were given 4-aminobiphenyl (source 
and purity not stated; b.p. 302°C) in a gelatin capsule daily, six times per week until 
termination of the study. The dose level was lo wered during the course of the experiment 
and dosing was also interrupted temporarily due to severe toxicity. The experiment was 
terminated after two years and nine months (total dose per dog: 2.9 and 3.3 g/kg bw, 
respectively); both dogs had bladder carcinoma [while no concurrent controls were 
included, historical data from this laboratory show that thirty Beagle dogs ranging from three to nine years of age did not develop bladder tumours] (Walpole et al. , 1954). 
Four young adult female mongrel dogs were  given a small quantity of ‘purified’ 
4-aminobiphenyl (source not given) admixed into the food on five days a week for one year; after that, the animals received three times weekly by mouth a capsule containing 
0.3 g of this compound. Bladder carcinomas were observed in all four dogs after 21–
34 months. The total dose until first appear ance of tumours was 87.5–144.0 g per dog, 
which corresponded to 8.2–14.1 g/kg bw (Deichmann et al. , 1958) [no controls were 
included]. 
Six female pure-bred beagle dogs, 6–12 mont hs of age, were given 4-aminobiphenyl 
(source and purity not indicated) by mouth in a capsule at 1.0 mg/kg bw, five times per 
week for two years and 10 months (four dogs) or three years and one month (two dogs). 
The total dose range was 5.35–7.34 g per dog.  Three bladder papillomas and three bladder 
carcinomas (transitional cell type) were  observed in the six dogs (Deichmann et al. , 
1965). 
Two male and four female pure-bred beagle  dogs were each given a single oral dose 
of 50 mg/kg bw 4-aminobiphenyl (purity, 98–99%) by capsule; the male dogs died within 
18 hours, the females suffered severe acute intoxication, but surviv ed and remained in 
good health for five years, as did two other female dogs that received a single oral dose of 15 mg/kg bw. There were no tumours in the ur inary bladder of any of these female dogs 
(Deichmann & MacDonald, 1968). [The Working Group noted the inadequate dosing in 
this study.] 
In an initiation-promotion study, four female pure-bred beagle dogs were given a 
single initiating dose of 4-aminobiphenyl (50 mg/kg bw; source and purity not specified) 
in corn oil by capsule. After recovery from  severe acute methaemoglobinaemia, the dogs 
received a daily supplement of 6 g 
D,L-tryptophan as a promoter admixed into 300 g dog 
chow during the rest of the experiment. One dog killed due to injury after six months 
showed preneoplastic changes in the bladder of the type produced by tryptophan alone. After 4.5 years, the bladder of the three othe r dogs also showed typical changes seen after 
tryptophan treatment: macrophagic and lymphocytic infiltration, epithelial hyperplasia, 
irregularity of the basal layer and erosion of the luminal surface. One dog had developed a  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 83  
 small papillary bladder tumour. Since a single dose of 4-aminobiphenyl or chronic 
treatment with tryptophan had not produced tumours or preneoplastic changes in the bladder in previous studies (see Deic hmann & MacDonald, 1968; Radomski et al. , 1971), 
this result was considered by the authors as suggestive of a promotin g or co-carcinogenic 
effect of tryptophan (Radomski et al. , 1977). [The Working Group noted that the lack of a 
tryptophan-only treated group; the inadequate design of the Deichmann & MacDonald 
(1968) study made the authors’ conclusion hard to believe.] 
Twenty-four female pure-bred beagle dogs, four months of age, were given 
4-aminobiphenyl (source, purity and dose ( sic) not stated) in a corn oil suspension 
contained in a capsule on five days a week for three years. Twenty  control animals were 
included. Two dogs remained without detect able tumours, two showed Grade-1 tumours 
very late in the study, and 20 animals deve loped tumours that ultim ately progressed into 
Grade-2 and -3 bladder tumours (mainl y transitional cell carcinomas) (Block et al. , 1978). 
[The Working Group noted the absence of in formation on the twenty control animals.] 
3.2 Subcutaneous administration 
3.2.1  Mouse 
Fifty-two newborn Swiss mice were given a subcutaneous injection of 200 μg of 
4-aminobiphenyl (Koch-Light; distilled before u se) in 0.02 mL of 3% aqueous gelatin on 
each of the first three days of life. Forty-three mice survived until 48–52 weeks. Among the survivors, 19 of 20 (95%) male and 4 of 23 (17%) female mice had ‘hepatomas’. Only 
three (3%) mice developed hepatomas in a control group of 42 males and 48 females 
(Gorrod et al. , 1968). 
In a multistep in-vitro/in-vivo system, SV40-immortalized human urothelial cells 
were treated for 24h with 4-aminobiphenyl an d maintained in culture for six weeks. The 
cells were then inoculated subcutaneously into female athymic nude ( nu/nu ) mice (age 4–
6 weeks). After six months, 28 of 45 (62%) treated mice had developed carcinomas, and 
none of nine controls inoculated with cells treated with DMSO (Bookland et al. , 1992a). 
3.2.2  Rat 
Groups of 10 male and 12 female albino rats, three months of age and weighing 
100 g, from a closed but randomly mated co lony, were each subdivided in two groups and 
given 4-aminobiphenyl (purified, b.p. 302°C) in arachis oil by subcutaneous injection 
daily during 250–376 days, to a total dose of 3.6–5.8 g/kg bw. In the control group that 
received arachis oil only, one of 12 (8%) male and four of 11 (36%) female rats 
developed injection-site sarcomas. One female (9%) rat developed an intestinal tumour. 
In the treated groups, seven of 23 (30%) animals had intestinal tumours, one (4%) had a 
liver sarcoma, three of 12 females (25%) had mammary tumours and two (17%) had carcinoma of the uterus (Walpole et al. , 1952). 84 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 3.3 Intraperitoneal injection 
3.3.1  Mouse 
In a comparative carcinogenicity study of heterocyclic amines, newborn male 
B6C3F 1/nctr mice [initial number not clear] were  given 4-aminobiphenyl (purity > 98%) 
by intraperitoneal injection. The amo unts administered were 1.25 and 0.625 μmol 
dissolved in 35 μl dimethyl sulfoxide, injected in portions of 5, 10 and 20 μl on days 1, 8 
and 15 after birth, respectively. Surviving pups were weaned on day 21 and designated for necropsy at 8 or 12 months of age. Mortality was 43% for th e low-dose and 58% for 
the high-dose group. At 12 months, the 19 and 15 surviving mice in the low- and high-
dose groups, respectively, all had liver adenomas ( vs 11% in the 44 DMSO controls; 
P < 0.001, Fisher exact test). Among these, five mice in each group had liver carcinomas 
(26 and 33%, respectively) (Dooley et al. , 1992). 
Twenty-four newborn B6C3F
1 mice were treated with 0.3 μmol 4-aminobiphenyl (re-
purified to > 99%, verified by HPLC) dissolved in DMSO, by a series of intraperitoneal 
injections: 1/7th of the dose on postnatal day 1, 2/7th on day 8, and 4/7th on day 15. 
Eighteen control mice received DMSO only . Adenomas were found in 22.2% of the 
controls and in 79.2% of the treated mice. Hepatocellular carcinomas were observed in 
two treated animals (Parsons et al. , 2005). 
Newborn male CD1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4-aminobiphenyl 
(purity > 99%) at a total dose of 625 nmol in 35 μl DMSO, given in portions of 5, 10 and 
20 μl on days 1, 8, and 15 after birth, respectively. At weaning, the animals were divided 
into two groups, which were fed ad libitum  until they were 14 weeks of age. Thereafter, 
one group received 90% of the calories of the ad libitum  feeding regimen during one 
week, followed by 75% of the calories during one week, and then 60% of the calories in 
the diet until sacrifice at 12 months. Of 22 mice fed ad libitum , 12 (55%) had liver 
adenomas, six (27%) had hepatocellular carci nomas, and two mice (9%) had bronchio-
alveolar adenoma. No liver tumours were  seen in the calorie-restricted group ( n = 19), but 
two mice (11%) developed bronchio-alveolar adenomas (Von Tungeln et al. , 1996). [The 
Working Group noted the lack  of untreated controls.] 
In a study to investigate the role of  CYP1A2 in carcinogenesis induced by 
4-aminobiphenyl, groups of mice deficient in cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2- null), 
derived from a mixed background of 129/Sv and C57BL/6 strains, received 
intraperitoneal inject ions of 10 and 20 μl of solutions of 4-aminobiphenyl (Aldrich; re-
purified and re-crystallized) in DMSO on days 8 and 15 of age, respectively. One dose group was given a 20-mM solution and the other a 40-mM solution of 4-aminobiphenyl. 
The cumulative amounts of the test compound in the two dose groups were 600 and 1200 
nmol, respectively. The mice were killed at 16 months of age and the livers analysed by histology. Mice proficient in CYP1A2 (CYP1A2+/+) were similarly treated. In the 
CYP1A2+/+ mice, both the high-dose and lo w-dose treatments cau sed a significant 
increase ( P < 0.01) in liver adenomas (69–70%) and hepatocellular carcinomas (15–20%) 
in males compared with a control group cons isting of a combination of CYP1A2+/+, +/–  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 85  
 and –/– mice treated with DMSO only. In fe males, the percentages were 3–17% and 0–
4%, respectively. No differences in tumour  incidence were seen with the different 
genotypes (CYP1A2-proficient or deficient) or with different doses of 4-aminobiphenyl 
(Kimura et al. , 1999). [The Working Group noted the inadequacy of the DMSO controls.] 
3.4 Intravesicular implantation 
Thirty-five albino mice [sex, age and strain  not specified] received an intravesicular 
implant of 4-aminobiphenyl (British Drug Houses; dose unclear) in paraffin wax. After 
40 weeks, three of 35 mice (9%) had developed an invasive bladder carcinoma. This tumour yield was not significantly different from that in the control mice implanted with 
paraffin wax alone (2/56; 4%) (Bonser et al. , 1956). 
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion 
4.1.1  Humans 
Grimmer et al.  (2000) analysed the amounts of the aromatic amines 1- and 2-
naphthylamine and 2- and 4-aminobiphenyl in the urine of 48 German smokers and non-
smokers. Both groups excrete these four ar omatic amines, with smokers excreting 
approximately twice as much as non-smokers (736 ng/24h vs 327 ng/24h). Similar 
amounts of urinary 2-naphthylamine and 4-amin obiphenyl were found in the two groups. 
The origin of the aromatic amines found in  the urine of non-smokers is at present 
unknown. Based on the cotinine levels in  the urine of non-smokers, environmental 
tobacco smoke can be excluded as a major source of aromatic amines. In addition, neither 
diesel exhaust-related nitroarenes nor the co rresponding amino-derivatives to which they 
may be metabolically converted were detected. The aromatic amines in urine arising from sources other than tobacco smoke or diesel ex haust may play a role in the etiology of 
bladder cancer in non-smokers (Grimmer et al. , 2000). 
A method for measuring ortho -toluidine, 2-naphthylamine and 4-aminobiphenyl in 
the urine of smokers and non-smokers used acid hydrolysis of the arylamine conjugates in 
urine, extraction with n-hexane, derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride, and 
subsequent analysis with ga s chromatography combined with mass spectrometry using 
negative-ion chemical ionization. The limits of detection were 4 ng/L for ortho -toluidine 
and 1 ng/L for 2-naphthylamine a nd 4-aminobiphenyl. Smokers ( n = 10) excreted 
significantly higher amounts of ortho -toluidine (204 vs 104 ng/24 hours), 2-amino-
naphthalene (20.8 vs 10.7 ng/24 hours), and 4-aminobiphenyl (15.3 vs 9.6 ng/24 hours) 
than non-smokers ( n = 10). All non-smokers had quantifiable amounts of ortho -toluidine, 86 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 2-naphthylamine, and 4-aminobiphenyl in their urine, confirming that there are other 
environmental sources of exposure to these compounds (Riedel et al. , 2006). 
4.1.2  Experimental systems 
4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) is activated by cytochrome P450 (CYP), to produce the 
genotoxic N-hydroxy-4-ABP metabolite, which reacts with DNA. 
Anderson et al.  (1997) examined pancreatic tissues from 29 organ donors 
(13 smokers, 16 non-smokers) for their ability to metabolize aromatic amines and other carcinogens. Microsomes showed no  activity in CYP1A2-dependent N-oxidation of 
4-aminobiphenyl. Antibodies were used to examine microsomal levels of CYP1A2, 2A6, 
2C8/9/18/19, 2E1, 2D6, and 3A3/4/5/7 and epoxide hydrolase. Immunoblots detected only epoxide hydrolase at low levels; CYP leve ls were < 1% of those in the liver. In 
pancreatic cytosols and microsomes, 4-nitr obiphenyl reductase activity was present at 
levels comparable to those in human liver. The O-acetyltransferase activity (AcCoA-
dependent DNA-binding of radiolabelled N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl) of pancreatic 
cytosols was high, about two thirds the levels  measured in human colo n. Cytosols showed 
high activity for N-acetylation of para-aminobenzoic acid, but not of sulfamethazine, 
indicating that acetyltransferase-1 is predomin antly expressed in this tissue. Cytosolic 
sulfo-transferase was detected at low levels. 
32P-postlabelling showed putative arylamine-
DNA adducts in most samples. In eight of 29 DNA samples, a major adduct was 
observed, which was chromatographically identical to the predominant ABP-DNA 
adduct, N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-aminobiphenyl. 
Chou et al.  (1995) investigated the role of hu man sulfotransferase(s) in the bio-
activation of the N-hydroxy metabolite of 4-aminobiphenyl ( N-OH-ABP) in vitro  with 
human tissue cytosols. Using an enzymatic assay consisting of a PAPS-regenerating 
system, radio-labelled N-OH-ABP, calf-thymus DNA and tissue cytosols, the 
sulfotransferase-mediated metabolic activation of N-OH-ABP was determined as the 
PAPS-dependent covalent binding of the N-OH substrate to DNA. The sulfotransferase(s) 
in human liver, and to a lesser ex tent colon, can readily metabolize N-OH-ABP. No 
metabolic activation was detected with cyto sols prepared from human pancreas or from 
the carcinogen target tissue, the urinary bladder epithelium. The N-OH-ABP 
sulfotransferase activities of liver and colon cytosols from different individuals were 
highly correlated with their thermostable phe nol sulfotransferase (T S-PST) activity (liver, 
r = 0.99, P < 0.01; colon, r = 0.88, P < 0.01). N-OH-ABP sulfotransferase activity was 
highly sensitive to inhibition by the selective TS-PST inhibitor 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol (IC
50 = 0.7 microM), and by para-nitrophenol. These data show  that human liver TS-PST 
can metabolically activate th e proximate human carcinogen N-OH-ABP to a reactive 
sulfuric acid ester intermediate that binds to DNA. In addition, in view of the putative role of N-OH-ABP as a major transport form of the carcinogen to the urinary bladder and of 
the absence of sulfotransferase activity in th is tissue, sulfotransferase activation in the 
liver may actually decrease the bioavailability of N-OH-ABP to extrahepatic tissues and  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 87  
 thus serve as an overall detoxification mechanism for the urinary bladder (Chou et al. , 
1995). 
Adris and Chung (2006) investigated Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an opportunistic 
pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria for 
metabolic activation of the bladder pro-carcinogens 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine. When incubated with each of those agents, the cell-free extracts of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , Enterobacter aerogenes , Proteus mirabilis , 
Proteus vulgaris , Staphylococcus epidermidis , Staphylococcus saprophyticus , Klebsiella 
pneumoniae , and the intestinal anaerobes Bacteroides fragilis , Clostridium perfringens , 
and Eubacterium aerofaciens  produced increased numbers of histidine revertants with the 
tester strain Salmonella typhimurium  TA98 in the Salmonella  mutagenicity assay. In 
addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Bacteroides fragilis , and 
Eubacterium aerofaciens  each showed the presence of a CYP absorption peak in the 
carbon monoxide difference spectrum. This was not observed with the other bacteria. These findings indicate that human endog enous bacteria, which are opportunistic 
pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate these bladder pro-
carcinogens into mutagens. Th e metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 
Bacteroides fragilis , and Eubacterium aerofaciens  is mediated by a CYP enzyme. For 
those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a CYP absorption 
peak with the cell-free extracts, othe r oxidative enzymes may be involved. 
4.1.3  Other in-vitro studies 
In-vitro studies have been conducted with human and animal microsomal 
preparations of liver and urinary bladder, and with purified CYPs and recombinant CYPs 
(Beland & Kadlubar, 1985). CYP1A2 displays the highest catalytic acitivity of the CYPs 
for N-oxidation of 4-ABP, and it is the principal CYP involved in N-hydroxylation of 4-
ABP in human and rat liver microsomes (Butler et al. , 1989). The k
cat of N-oxidation of 4-
ABP is about fivefold greater with pooled human liver microsomes than with human 
urinary bladder microsomes fortified with NADPH, but the Km values are comparable 
between the two microsomal preparations (Nakajima et al. , 2006). Several human 
endogenous bacteria, which are pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically 
activate the 4-ABP and other bladder procarci nogens. For some of these microorganisms, 
metabolic activation is mediated by a CYP enzyme (Adris & Chung, 2006). 
A large inter-individual variation in N-oxidation of 4-ABP in human liver 
microsomes is attributed to the variable CYP1A2 protein content (Butler et al. , 1989; 
Turesky et al. , 1998). Subjects who display relatively high CYP1A2 activity and who are 
rapid N-oxidizers of 4-ABP may be at elevated ri sk for cancer arising from exposure to 
aromatic amines or heterocyclic aromatic amines (Butler et al. , 1992). However, recent 
data from studies on laboratory animals have questioned the importance of CYP1A2 in 
the toxicity and carcinogenicity of 4-ABP. In CYP1A2 -knockout animals, formation of 
methaemoglobin, which occurs by co-oxidation of N-hydroxy-4-ABP with oxy-88 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 haemoglobin (Kiese, 1966), was lower in CYP1A2 -knockout mice than in CYP1A2 -wild-
type mice (Shertzer et al. , 2002), and 4-ABP-DNA adducts were formed in livers of 
CYP1A2 -knockout mice at even higher  levels than in livers of CYP1A2  wild-type mice 
(Tsuneoka et al. , 2003). In the neonat al mouse cancer model, CYP1A2 -null mice had the 
same level of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the CYP1A2 -wild-type mice following 
exposure to 4-ABP (Kimura et al. , 1999). From these findings, it appears that CYP1A2 is 
not the primary enzyme responsible for the N-hydroxylation 4-ABP in the mouse; thus 
other enzymes must be involved in the bioactivation and toxicities of 4-ABP. Indeed, liver microsomes from CYP1A2 -null mice displayed an activity as least half as great as 
the liver microsomes from CYP1A2 -wild-type mice in N-oxidation of 4-ABP (Kimura 
et al. , 1999). The enzymes responsible for this bio-activation remain to be determined. 
The high doses of 4-ABP employed in these animal studies could have triggered the 
activities of other enzymes to catalyse the N-oxidation of 4-ABP, a reaction process that 
normally does not occur after low-dose treatments. The N-oxidation of 4-ABP is known 
to be carried out principally by CYP1A2 in rat and human liver microsomes (Kimura 
et al. , 1999); these studies reveal species di fferences in 4-ABP metabolism by CYPs 
among mice, rats, and humans. 
Extrahepatic CYPs, peroxidases, and prostagl andin-H synthase have been reported to 
catalyse the bioactivation of 4-ABP. Recombinant CYPs 1A1, 1B1 and 2A13 have been 
shown to bioactivate 4-ABP (5 µM), when induction of umu gene expression in 
S. typhimurium  NM2009 was used as an endpoint (Shimada et al. , 1996; Nakajima et al. , 
2006). These CYP enzymes could contribute to  4-ABP damage in extrahepatic tissues. 
Enzymes in bovine bladder epithelium and dog-bladder epithelium bioactivate arylamines, including 4-ABP (10–30 µg/plate) into bacterial mutagens in S. typhimurium  
TA98 (frame-shift specific) (Hix et al. , 1983), and they catalyse 4-ABP binding to DNA 
(Wise et al. , 1984). Intact cells or cell homogenates (S-9 fraction) from bovine bladder 
were found to be more effective than were liver preparations in the activation of 4-ABP 
(1–20 µg/plate) into a bacterial mutagen, in S. typhimurium  TA98 (Hix et al. , 1983) and 
TA100 (point-mutation specific) strains (Oglesby et al. , 1983). Intact bovine urothelial 
cells also weakly bioactivated 4-ABP (5– 20 µg/mL) into a mutagen in Chinese hamster 
V79 cells (Oglesby et al. , 1983). Prostaglandin H synthase,  with arachidonic acid serving 
as a co-factor, has been shown to cataly se the binding of 4-ABP to DNA (Flammang 
et al. , 1989). This enzyme is present in urinary bladder epithelium, prostatic epithelium, 
colonic mucosa, and peripher al lung tissue of many sp ecies. Peroxidases, which are 
expressed at appreciable le vels in the lung (Culp et al. , 1997) and mammary gland 
(Josephy 1996), also cata lyse the binding of 4-ABP to DNA (Gorlewska-Roberts et al. , 
2004). These results demonstrate the capaci ty of enzymes in extrahepatic tissues, 
including the bladder urothelium, to metabolically activate aromatic amines, and they suggest a role for the target orga ns in carcinogen bioactivation. 
N-hydroxy-4-ABP can undergo further meta bolism by phase-II enzymes to produce 
highly unstable esters. The esters undergo he terolytic cleavage to produce the reactive 
nitrenium ion, which readily forms adducts  with DNA. NAT1 and NAT2 isoforms of  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 89  
 human and rodent N-acetyltransferases catalyse the formation of N-acetoxy-4-ABP 
(Minchin et al. , 1992), while sulfotransferase (SULT1A1) (Chou et al. , 1995) produces 
the N-sulfate ester of 4-ABP. These produc ts may be the penultimate carcinogenic 
metabolites of 4-ABP formed in vivo . There are several metabolic reactions, including N-
acetylation, that can compete with the CYP-mediated N-oxidation of 4-ABP. The 
resulting acetamide of 4-ABP is a poor substrate for CYP1A2, and N-acetylation is 
considered to be primarily a detoxification reaction (Cohen et al. , 2006). The rate of N-
acetylation of 4-ABP with recombinant human  NAT1 was threefold greater than with 
recombinant human NAT2, whereas the O-acetylation of N-hydroxy-4-ABP was about 
twofold higher with NAT2 (Minchin et al. , 1992). Thus, human NAT isoforms are 
involved in the detoxification of 4-ABP as well as in the bioactivation of N-hydroxy-4-
ABP. 
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
4.2.1  DNA adducts 
DNA adducts of 4-ABP have been reported in vitro , in bacterial and mammalian 
cells, in experimental animals exposed to 4-ABP or its metabolites, and in human tissues. Three major adducts are formed when N-hydroxy-4-ABP is reacted with calf-thymus 
DNA at pH 5.0: N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-ABP (dG-C8 –4-ABP) is the principal adduct 
and formed in 80% yield, followed by N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-ABP (15% yield) and 
N-(deoxyguanosin- N
2-yl)-4-ABP (5% yield) (Beland et al. , 1983; Beland & Kadlubar, 
1985). The N2-deoxyguanosine adduct is unusual in that it contains a hydrazo linkage. 
More recently, 3-(deoxyguanosin- N2-yl)-4-ABP and N-(deoxyguanosin- N2-yl)-4-
azobiphenyl have been identified as minor DNA adducts of 4-ABP (Hatcher & 
Swaminathan, 2002; Swaminathan & Hatcher, 2002). 
(a) Humans 
The adduct dG-C8–4-ABP was first detected by 32P-postlabelling in biopsy samples 
of the human urinary bladder (Talaska et al. , 1991). Thereafter, the adduct was detected 
by gas-chromatography/nega tive-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC-NICI-
MS) in mucosa specimens of human lung and urinary bladder; it was found at levels 
ranging from < 0.32–49.5 adducts per 108 nucleotides in lung, and from < 0.32–3.94 
adducts per 108 nucleotides in the bladder samples (Lin et al. , 1994). A subsequent study 
reported the detection of the dG-C8–4-ABP adduct by immuno-histochemistry, 
32P-postlabelling, or GC-NICI-MS in bladder and lung tissue from smokers and ex-
smokers (Culp et al. , 1997). The adduct levels measured by immuno-histochemistry 
ranged from three adducts per 108 nucleotides (the limit of detection) up to 505 adducts 
per 108 nucleotides. Comparable data were obtained through GC-NICI-MS 
measurements. The 32P-postlabelling analyses underestim ated the adduct level by up to 
30-fold, suggesting that human lung DNA ma y be resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis, 90 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 possibly as a consequence of the high levels  of DNA damage among current smokers. 
The 4-ABP adduct levels did not correlate with the numbers of cigarettes smoked per day or the duration of smoking, so the 4-ABP addu cts in lung were propo sed to originate from 
environmental exposure to 4-nitrobiphenyl (Culp et al. , 1997). The frequent detection of 
dG-C8–4-ABP adducts in non-smokers indicat es that there may be other environmental 
sources of exposure as well: one such  source may be hair dyes (Turesky et al. , 2003). 
Wang et al.  (1998) used immunohistochemistry to detect 4-ABP-DNA adducts in 
livers of subjects from Taiwan, China, with  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mean 
relative staining intensity for 4-ABP-DNA was slightly higher in tumour tissues than in 
non-tumour tissues obtained from the same HCC patients. The mean intensities were 
significantly higher than the mean intensities from control tissues taken from non-HCC patients. However, no difference in mean relative staining intensity was found between 
smokers and nonsmokers in tissues obtained from non-HCC patients, or between tumour 
or non-tumour tissues taken from HCC cases. Afte r stratification of the relative staining 
intensity data for 4-ABP-DNA adducts, there was a monotonically increasing risk for 
HCC with higher 4-ABP adduct levels; the linear relationship between adduct levels in 
liver tissue and HCC risk remained significan t after adjustment for covariates, including 
hepatitis B surface-antigen status. 
The DNA from the induced sputum of smokers, representing DNA of the lower 
respiratory tract, was shown to possess signif icantly higher levels of 4-ABP-DNA adducts 
than in the sputum of non-smokers, when assessed by immunohistochemical staining. The 
levels of adducts were related to indices of current smoking (cigarettes/day: r = 0.3, 
P = 0.04 and tar/day: r = 0.4, P = 0.02) (Besaratinia et al. , 2000). Faraglia et al.  (2003) 
also detected 4-ABP-DNA adducts in fema le breast-tissue biopsy samples, when 
visualized by immunohistochemistry; the woman’s smoking status was correlated with 
the levels of 4-ABP-DNA in tumour-adjacent normal tissues, but not in tumour tissue. 
4-ABP-DNA adducts were also detected in laryngeal biopsies by immunohistochemical 
methods. Staining-intensity data showed a log-normal distribution, and values determined 
in tumour-adjacent tissue from individuals  who smoked were significantly higher 
(median: 173.5, geometric mean: 159.9) th an those values measure d in tumour-adjacent 
tissue from non-smokers (median: 75 .5, geometric mean: 7.40) (Faraglia et al. , 2003). 
Epithelial cell DNA isolated from human breast milk was shown by 
32P-postlabelling to 
contain N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-ABP, and the adduct level was significantly associated 
with the use of hair-colouring products (OR = 11.2, 95% CI = 1.1–109.2), but not with 
tobacco usage (Ambrosone et al. , 2007). 
Recent studies have employed  liquid chromatography/el ectrospray ionization/tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) methods  to quantify dG-C8–4-ABP in human 
tissues. Zayas et al.  (2007) detected dG-C8–4-ABP in urinary bladder epithelium in 12 of 
27 subjects in DNA of tumour or non-tumour surrounding tissue. The level of adducts 
ranged from five to 80 adducts per 109 bases. The level of DNA adducts did not correlate 
with the level of the 4-ABP-haemoglobin-sulfi namide adduct; the latter is derived from 4-
nitrosobiphenyl, an oxidation product of N-hydroxy-4-ABP, and a biomarker of exposure  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 91  
 to an internal dose of 4-ABP (Skipper & Tannenbaum, 1994; Zayas et al. , 2007). The 
lack of correlation of 4-ABP-DNA and -protein biomarkers may be attributed to an unknown time of formation of the observed adducts and to a variable persistence of dG-
C8–4-ABP in the bladder. Because the activ ation or detoxification processes of 4-ABP 
metabolism as well as DNA-repair mechanisms may be tissue-specific, a correlation 
between haemoglobin (Hb) adducts and biopsied DNA adducts may not exist. The 
metabolism of 4-ABP is complex and/or may take place in one or more compartments 
that are distant from the urinary bladder. Thus, prediction of the relationship between exposure and adduct levels is not straightforward. Another pilot study reported the 
presence of dG-C8–4-ABP in six of 12 human pancreas samples (Ricicki et al. , 2005). 
The levels ranged anywhere from 1 to 60/10
8 nucleotides, but there were no correlations 
among between the level of adducts, smoking preference, age, or gender. The frequency 
of hair-dye usage was not reported in the study. 
4-ABP forms a major adduct at the 93 β cysteine amino acid of human Hb (Green 
et al. , 1984; Ringe et al. , 1988). Adduct formation occurs following the co-oxidation 
reaction of N-hydroxy-4-ABP with oxy-Hb (Kiese 196 6). The resulting 4-nitrosobiphenyl 
product reacts with the sulfhydryl group of cy steine to form a sulf inamide adduct (Green 
et al. , 1984; Ringe et al. , 1988; Bryant et al. , 1988). Several human biomonitoring studies 
have shown a relationship between the frequ ency of tobacco smoki ng, the extent of 
4-ABP-Hb-adduct formation, and bladder-cancer risk (Bryant et al. , 1988; Skipper & 
Tannenbaum, 1994; Jiang et al. , 2007). Thus far, investigations have not examined the 
relationship between the frequency of hair dye-usage and 4-ABP-Hb adduct levels; 
however, statistically signifi cant increases in levels of 3, 5-dimethylaniline-Hb adducts 
have been found in women who regularly used permanent hair dyes (Gan et al. , 2004). 
(b) Experimental systems 
The methods of 4-ABP-DNA adduct detection include: HPLC with radiometric 
detection of tritium -labelled adducts; 32P-postlabelling; immunhistochemistry; GC-NICI-
MS of alkali-treated DNA, which cleaves th e bond between the gua nyl C8 atom and the 
4-amino group of 4-ABP in dG-C8–4-ABP; and LC-ESI-MS/MS (Beland & Kadlubar, 1985; Lin et al. , 1994; Culp et al. , 1997; Doerge et al. , 1999). 
N-Hydroxy-4-ABP reacts wi th DNA at neutral pH (pH 7.0) to form covalent adducts, 
but the reactivity is enhanced tenfold under acidic conditions (pH 5.0), which catalyses the generation of the highly reactive nitrenium ion (Beland et al. , 1983). Such mildly 
acidic pH conditions can occur in the urinar y bladder and can cause the hydrolysis of the 
metabolite N
4-(β-glucosiduronyl)- N-hydroxy-4-ABP to produce N-hydroxy-4-ABP and 
its nitrenium ion, leading to DNA adduc ts in the bladder epithelium (Beland et al. , 1983; 
Kadlubar et al. , 1991). 
Beagle dogs were treated with tritium-labelled 4-ABP at a single dose of 60 µmol/kg 
bw and sacrificed after one, two, or seven days. DNA adducts in urothelial cells were 
monitored by HPLC with radiometric detection (Beland & Kadlubar, 1985). The level of 
adducts in the animals was essentially constant at each time point, with 92 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4 -ABP accounting for 76% of the to tal binding. The next most 
abundant product was the N2-deoxyguanosine substituted adduct (15%), followed by the 
N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-ABP adduct (9%). These same adducts and 3-(deoxyguanosin-
N2-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl and N-(deoxyguanosin- N2-yl)-4-azobiphenyl were detected by 
32P-postlabelling of DNA in human uroepithelial cells exposed to N-hydroxy-4-ABP 
(Hatcher & Swaminathan, 2002; Swaminathan & Hatcher, 2002). 
DNA adducts of 4-ABP were quantified, by 32P-postlabelling and immuno-
histochemistry, in liver and bladder of male and female BALB/c mice, following treatment with a range of c oncentrations of 4-ABP (0, 7, 14, 28, 55, 110 or 220 ppm; 
male) and (0, 7, 19, 38, 75, 150 or 300 ppm; female) in the drinking-water for 28 days 
(Poirier et al. , 1995). The principal adduct in both  tissues, for both genders, was dG-C8–
4-ABP. A comparison between DNA-adduct formation and tumourigenesis indicated a 
linear correlation between adduct levels and incidence of liver tumours in female mice. 
The relationship between adducts and tumour igenesis was distinctly  nonlinear in the 
bladders of male mice, and tumour incidence rose rapidly above the 50-ppm dose of 4-
ABP: toxicity and cell proliferation may ha ve increased the bladder-tumour incidence. 
4.2.2  Mutations and other related effects 
(a)  Mutagenesis in bacteria 
4-Aminobiphenyl and other primary ar ylamines are frameshift mutagens in S. 
typhimurium  strain TA1538 (Beland et al. , 1983). When revertants were expressed as a 
function of DNA binding, N-hydroxy- N
′-acetylbenzidine was found to be the most 
mutagenic arylamine, followed by N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene, and then by N-hydroxy-
2-naphthylamine ( N-OH-2-NA) and N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl; the latter two showed 
approximately the same number of revertants per adduct. In a similar study conducted 
with S. typhimurium  strain strain TA 1535, which de tects base-substitution revertants, 
only N-OH-2-NA induced mutations (Beland et al. , 1983). 
More recent studies with the TA100 strain (base substit ution-specific) containing 
plasmid pKM101 (which enhances the mutage nic potential of some genotoxicants 
through error- prone DNA-repair polymerases) have sh own that 4-ABP (3–300 µg/plate) 
induces revertants in the TA100 strain, in th e presence of a rat liver S-9 mix from animals 
pretreated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), at levels five- to tenfold higher than in 
TA98 (frameshift-specific) (Chung et al. , 2000). The mutagenic potency of 4-ABP (1–
1000 µg/plate) was also great er in strain YG1029 (base subs titution-speci fic strain), 
which has multiple copies of the bacterial O-acetyltransferase (Dang & McQueen, 1999), 
indicating formati on of the reactive N-acetoxy-4-ABP intermediate. 
The induction of the umu response of 4-ABP (0.1–20 µM) in S. typhimurium  strain 
NM6001, containing human NAT1, was about fo urfold greater than in strain NM6002 
expressing human NAT2, when recombinant hum an CYP1A2 was used  for bioactivation 
of 4-ABP (Oda, 2004). Consistent with th ese data, NAT1 was superior to NAT2 in 
inducing the binding of N-hydroxy-4-ABP to DNA (Minchin et al. , 1992). 4-ABP  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 93  
 (5 µg/plate), in the presence of rat liver S-9 (PCB pretreatment), also induced mutations in 
S. typhimurium  strain TA102, which is sensitive to agents producing reactive oxygen 
species (Makena & Chung, 2007 ). The generation of reac tive oxygen species may occur 
through redox cycling of N-hydroxy-4-ABP and its nitroso metabolite (Kim et al. , 2004) 
via a hydronitroxide radical as an intermediate (Makena & Chung, 2007). 
Verghis et al.  (1997) studied mutagenesis of 4-ABP in E.coli in the lacZ gene using 
M13 cloning vectors able to detect many base-pair substi tution mutations and most 
insertions and deletions. To minimize the effect of host DNA-repair processes, 
mutagenicity experiments were performed with single-stranded DNA randomly modified 
with 4-ABP instead of double-stranded DN A. Sequence analysis of 4-ABP-induced 
mutations in the lacZ gene revealed exclusively base-pair  substitutions, with over 80% of 
the mutations occurring at G sites. Among the sequence changes at G sites, G:C → to T:A 
transversions predominated, followed by G:C → C:G transversions, and G:C → A:T 
transitions. An oligonucleotide containing the major DNA adduct, N-(deoxyguanosin-8-
yl)-4-aminobiphenyl (dG-C8–4-ABP ), was situated within the PstI site of a single-
stranded M13 genome to exam ine the mechanism of genotoxicity of this adduct. After in 
vivo replication of the adduct-containing 4-ABP-modified and control (unadducted) 
genomes, the mutational frequency and mutational specificity of the dG-C8–4-ABP 
lesion were determined. The targeted mutatio nal efficiency was ~0.01%, and the primary 
mutation observed was the G:C → C:G transversion (69%), followed by G:C → to T:A 
transversions (23%). In the mutagenesis studies with the randomly 4-ABP-modified 
vector, G:C → T:A transversions were the most numerous, possibly reflecting a 
sequence-context effect for the dG-C8–4-AB P lesion. Thus, although dG-C8–4-ABP is 
weakly mutagenic at the PstI site, it can contribute to the mutational spectrum of 4-ABP 
lesions (Verghis et al. , 1997). 
(b) Mutagenesis in mammalian cells 
(i) Mutations in HGPRT , chromosomal instability  
4-Aminobiphenyl and three of its proximate N-hydroxylated carcin ogenic metabolites 
(0.5–400 µM) were mutagenic in an SV40-immortalized human uroepithelial cell line, as assayed by use of induction of mutations in  the hypoxanthine-guani ne phosph oribosyl-
transferase ( HGPRT  or HPRT ) locus (Bookland et al. , 1992b). 2-ABP did not induce 
mutations in this cell line at these concentrations. 
Human bladder-cancer (RT112) cells treated with 4-ABP (125 µg/ml), with rat liver 
S-9 (after pretreatment with PCB) used for bio-activation, developed chromosomal 
instability in 50–60% of the cells. 4-ABP could affect tumour occurrence by inducing 
chromosomal instability, which represents the predominant form of genetic instability in 
human solid tumours (including those in bladder and colon) (Saletta et al. , 2007). 
N-Hydroxy-acetylaminobiphenyl ( N-OH-AABP) at a range of doses (0.5, 1.0, and 
10.0 µM) induced mutations by up to five- and 16-fold over background levels, 94 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 respectively, at the HPRT  and thymidine kinase ( TK) loci of human lymphoblastoid TK6 
cells (Luo et al. , 2005; Ricicki et al. , 2006). 
(ii) H -ras mutations caused by 4-ABP  
DNA adducts and mutations were induced in the livers of neonatal wild-type B6C3F 1 
and CD-1 mice, and in Big Blue B6C3F 1 transgenic neonatal and adult mice treated with 
a regimen of 4-ABP known to induce tumours in  neonatal mice (total doses: 3, 9 or 
31 mg/kg 4-ABP at days 8 and 15 postnatal; 31 mg/kg bw for adults) (Manjanatha et al. , 
1996). dG-C8–4-ABP was the major DNA adduct identified in the livers of Big Blue B6C3F
1 mice. Adduct levels for adult femal es were about twofold higher than for 
neonatal females, while adduct levels in adult males were less than half those in neonatal 
males. In the neonatal wild-type B6C3F 1 mice, 4-ABP preferentially induced C:G → A:T 
mutations (reflecting G:C → T:A transversions in th e non-coding strand) in H- ras codon 
61, followed by G:C → C:G mutations. However, in CD-1 mice, 4-ABP primarily 
induced A:T → T:A transversions in H- ras codon 61, a molecular feature consistent with 
the formation of the N-(dA-C8-yl)-4-ABP adduct (Manjanatha et al. , 1996). In the 
C57B1/10J mouse strain, mutations in codon 61 of the H- ras gene were not significantly 
implicated in chemical induction of liver tumours by 4-ABP (ABP was administered in 
diet at 200 and 600 ppm for nine months) (Lord et al. , 1992), suggesting that the 
incidence of Ras mutations in chemically-induced  mouse liver tumours is strain-
dependent. 
(iii) Transgene mutations caused by 4-ABP  
4-ABP was evaluated in the MutaTMMouse transgenic mouse mutation assay. A single 
oral dose of 75 mg/kg bw induced, respectiv ely, 6.9-, 1.8- and 2. 2-fold incr eases in the 
mutation frequency (MF) in the bladder, live r and bone marrow. Ten daily oral doses of 
10 mg/kg body weight of 4-ABP increased the MF in the bladder, liver, and bone marrow 
by 13.7-, 4.8- and 2.4-fold the co ntrol value, respectively (Fletcher et al. , 1998). 
4-ABP treatment significantly incr eased the mutations in the liver cII transgene in 
both genders of neonatal Big Blue B6C3F 1 transgenic mice but not in the adult mice, 
following treatment with a regimen of 4-ABP known to induce tumours in neonatal mice (total doses of 3, 9 or 31 mg/kg 4-ABP at days 8 and 15 postnatal; 31 mg/kg bw for 
adults). Sequence analysis of cII mutant DNA revealed that 4-ABP induced a unique 
spectrum of mutations in the neonatal mice, characterized by a high frequency of G:C → 
T:A transversions, while the mutational spectru m in 4-ABP-treated adults was similar to 
that in control mice. These authors suggested that neonates are more sensitive than adults 
to 4-ABP, because the relatively high levels of cell division in the developing animal facilitate the conversion of DNA damage into mutations (Chen et al. , 2005). The 
mutational spectrum data are consistent with the data seen for the tetracycline resistance 
gene of the plasmid pBR322, where 4-ABP modification resulted in G:C → to T:A and 
G:C →C:G transversions; frameshift mutations occurred with a lower frequency 
(Melchior et al. , 1994).  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 95  
 N-Hydroxy-4-acetylam inobiphenyl ( N-hydroxy-AABP) (10–320 µM) caused a dose-
dependent increase in mutation frequency – up to 12.8-fold over the background level – in 
the cII transgene in embryonic fibroblasts of the Big Blue mouse (Besaratinia et al. , 
2002). A high frequency of G:C → T:A transversions occurred in the cII transgene of 
treated cells. The authors concluded that the pattern of mutations induced in the cII gene 
by this metabolite of 4-ABP is at o dds with the mutational spectrum of the TP53  gene in 
human bladder cancer, where G:C → A:T transitions are the dominant type of mutation 
(Olivier et al. , 2002). 
(iv) TP53  mutations induced by 4-ABP  
About 50% of bladder cancers contain a mu tation in the tumour-suppressor gene 
TP53  (Olivier et al. , 2002). The spectrum of  mutations in the TP53  gene in smokers and 
non-smokers with bladder cancer shows base s ubstitutions occurring at G:C and A:T base 
pairs. Codon 285 of the TP53  gene, a mutational hotspot at a non-CpG site in bladder 
cancer, was found to be the preferential binding site for N-hydroxy-4-ABP (30 µM) in 
vitro (Feng et al. , 2002b). Moreover, C5-cytosine methylation greatly enhanced N-
hydroxy-4-ABP binding at CpG sites; two mu tational hotspots at CpG sites, codons 175 
and 248, became preferential binding sites for N-hydroxy-4-ABP only after being 
methylated. The distribution of 4-ABP–DNA adducts was mapped in the TP53  gene at 
the nucleotide-sequence level in human  bladder cells (HTB-1) treated with N-hydroxy-4-
ABP or N-hydroxy-AABP (30 µM) and mutational hotspots in bladder cancer at codons 
175, 248, 280, and 285 were preferential sites for 4-ABP adduct formation (Feng et al. , 
2002a). The authors suggested th at 4-ABP contributes to the mutational spectrum in the 
TP53  gene in human bladder cancer. These data provide some molecular evidence that 
links 4-ABP to bladder cancer, but the roles of methylation status and transcriptional 
activity in the mutational spectrum in the TP53  gene induced by 4-ABP have yet to be 
determined. 
4.2.3  Other biological effects of 4-ABP in mammalian cells 
In mammalian cells, 4-ABP and three of its proximate N-hydroxylated carcinogenic 
metabolites (0.5–400 µM) were genotoxic in an SV40-immortalized human uroepithelial 
cell line, in which mutation induction was measured at the hypoxanthin e-guanine 
phosphoribosyl-transferase ( HGPRT ) locus (Bookland et al. , 1992b). The isomeric 2-
ABP did not induce mutations at these concentrations. At very high concentrations, 
2-ABP and 4-ABP (500 µM), among other arylamines, were reported to induce DNA 
damage in human lymphocytes, as reve aled by use of the comet assay (Chen et al. , 2003). 
With N-hydroxy-AABP at a range of doses (0.5, 1.0 and 10.0 μM), the levels of 
dG-C8–4-ABP adducts in the cells ranged from 18 to 500 adducts per 109 nucleotides at 
27 hours, and resulted, respectively, in 95%,  85%, and 60% cell-survival rates. By means 
of statistical regression, 2250 genes were identi fied that showed sta tistically significant 
changes in expression after treatment with N-hydroxy-AABP; they included induced 96 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 stress-response genes such as members of the class of heat-shock proteins [Hsp40 
homologue (DNAJ), Hsp70, Hsp105, and Hsp1 25], and metal regulatory transcription 
factor 1 (MTF1). Another gene who se expression was upregulated was the XPA gene, 
which encodes a DNA-damage recognition prot ein involved in excision repair. Several of 
the genes were also induced in TK6 cells treated with benzo[ a]pyrene diol epoxide (Luo 
et al. , 2005; Ricicki et al. , 2006). The subsets of commonly regulated genes were 
indicative of a general cellular response to toxicity to these two classes of carcinogenic 
agents. 
DNA adducts were formed in transitional  cell carcinoma (TCC) cell lines from the 
huan urinary bladder expressing wild-type or mutant TP53 , following exposure to 
N-hydroxy-ABP, N-hydroxy-AABP or N-acetoxy-4-acetylam inobiphenyl ( N-OAc-
AABP) (Swaminathan et al. , 2002). The major adduct in th e cell lines was identified as 
dG-C8–4-ABP with all three chemicals. The number of adducts ranged from 0.1 to 20 per 
106 nucleotides, with N-OAc-AABP yielding the highest a dduct levels after 2 hours of 
treatment. Only N-OAc-AABP (5 µM) induced an apoptotic response, which was 
independent of the TP53  status. However, the TP53  status did affect repair rates, and the 
level of the dG-C8–4-ABP adduct was approx imately 2-fold higher in TCC cells with 
mutant TP53  than with wild-type TP53 , at 24 hours post-treatment. The authors 
concluded that TP53  could be modulating the repair of 4-ABP-DNA adducts in the 
human uroepithelial cells, and that unrepair ed DNA damage that accumulates in TP53-
deficient cells could cause an accumulation of mutation, increase genomic instability, and 
accelerate neoplastic progression. 
4.3 Mechanistic considerations 
Since biomonitoring was introduced to  assess exposure to aromatic amines, 
4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) was found in huma n samples. Originally the analysis of 
haemoglobin adducts pointed to  cigarette smoke as a source. Recently, 4-ABP as well as 
ortho -toluidine and 2-naphthylamine were detected in the urine of smokers and non-
smokers. The concentrations were significantl y higher in smokers than in nonsmokers in 
all three cases, but it was concluded that 4-ABP is a general environmental contaminant (Riedel et al. , 2006). Looking fo r the sources, 4-nitrobipheny l must be considered to 
contribute to the exposure. This applie s not only to the assessm ent of haemoglobin 
adducts, but also to guanine-C8-ABP-adducts in DNA. The biomarkers correlate with 
three risk factors for bladder cancer: cigarette  smoking, tobacco brand and slow-acetylator 
phenotype. DNA adducts have not only been demonstrated in human bladder tumours 
(Zayas et al. , 2007), bladder epithelium (Skipper & Tannenbaum, 1994) and in exfoliated 
urothelial cells (Talaska et al. , 1993), but also in mammary (Faraglia et al. , 2003) and 
other tissues (Cohen et al. , 2006; Saletta et al. , 2007). 
The common activation product of aminobiphenyls is the N-hydroxy derivative. 
Studies in dogs indicate that N-oxidation to N-hydroxyaminobiphenyl takes place in the 
liver, from where the metabolite is transferred to the bladder. The hydroxylamine may be  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 97  
 further activated by conjugation to form su lfate or acetate. The conjugates are unstable 
and give rise to the nitrenium ion that adds to DNA and gives promutagenic DNA adducts. Modifying factors of  DNA-adduct formation in the bladder are the pH of the 
urine and the frequency of urination (Kadlubar et al. , 1991). Although CYP1A2 is 
considered to be the enzyme primarily respon sible for the oxidation of arylamines in the 
liver, experiments with CYP1A2- knockout mice show that this is not the case with 4-ABP 
(Kimura et al. , 1999; Shertzer et al. , 2002). The lack of CYP1 A2 did not influence the 
decrease of the thiol SH-pool in  the liver, did not interfere with the consumption of 
glutathione in red cells, and increased the formation of methaemoglobin (Shertzer et al. , 
2002). This bears on the interpretation of indi vidual susceptibility of workers exposed to 
4-ABP. The activity of CYP1A2 varies by a factor of 60 in humans, and workers with 
high levels of active enzyme have been assu med to be more susceptible to developing 
bladder tumours than those with low levels of this enzyme. Another possible route of 
activation was suggested by the results of studies in S. typhimurium  strain TA102. In this 
case 4-ABP, activated by live r S9, induced mutations thr ough generation  of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) (Makena & Chung, 2007). 
The formation of haemoglobin adducts a nd DNA adducts in tissues other than the 
bladder supports the view that the activated metabolite is not only available in the target 
tissue for tumour formation but throughout the organism, and factors other than bladder-
specific activation must be r esponsible for the development of the bladder tumours. 
In addition to the dG-C8-ABP adduct, the dG- N2-ABP adduct and the dA-C8-ABP 
adduct were observed (Beland & Kadlubar, 1985; Swaminathan & Hatcher, 2002). 
Although 4-ABP like 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) produces the typical guanine-C8-adduct, the mutation pattern of the two chemicals is different. dG-C8-AF produces both 
frameshift and base-substitution (G to T) mutations, and dG-C8-ABP only base-
substitution (G to A) mutations, 2-AF bei ng more mutagenic than ABP. These differences 
are considered to arise from the different  conformational changes induced in DNA by 
aromatic amines, includ ing conversion from the anti- to the syn-conformation (Beland et 
al., 1983;  Beland & Kadlubar, 1985). So far a key to explain tissue specificity and 
individual susceptibility has not been found. 
Gene-expression profiles were measured in the TK6 lymphoblastoid cell line after 
exposure to N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl. The amount of the major dG-C8-ABP adduct 
was correlated with cell toxicity, mutation at the TK (thymidine kinase) and HPRT  loci 
and changes in gene expressi on. The expression of  2250 genes was significantly altered. 
Five genes related to functions of cell survival and cell growth were downregulated; all the others were upregulated (Ricicki et al. , 2006). The results indicate a possible approach 
to relate gene-expression patterns with phen otypic markers, but also show the complexity 
of the cellular response to a chemical insult. 
More recent results emphasize that the induc tion of mutations in the human genome 
may not be the only relevant genotoxic effect. Saletta et al.  (2007) propose that gross 
chromosomal alterations rather than point mu tations are responsible for the formation of 
bladder tumours. Chromosome aberrations and chromosomal instability are held to play a 98 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 
 central role. The induction of chromosomal in stability can be carcinogen-specific. 4-ABP 
induces chromosomal instability (CIN) in gene tically stable RT112 bladder cells, but no 
microsatellite instabil ity (MIN). Conversely, N-methyl- N’-nitro- N-nitrosoguanidine 
(MNNG) produces MIN but not CIN in these cel ls. CIN is generally defined as the ability 
to gain and lose chromosomes, a property fr equently observed in tumours, which makes 
them resistant to the toxic e ffects of carcinogens and giv es them a selective advantage. 
However, the actual role of chromosomal instability in ABP-i nduced bladder cancer 
remains to be established (Saletta et al. , 2007). 
The expanding knowledge about metabolic activation of 4-ABP and the causal 
relationship between DNA-adduct formation an d mutagenesis stimulated the expectation 
that differences in tissues and species, as we ll as individual susceptibility can be explained 
on the basis of the pharmacoki netic behaviour. However, Be land and Kadlubar and others 
stated as early as 1985: “It is clear that adduct formation per se  is not sufficient for tumour 
initiation and that ot her processes, such as error-prone repair and stimulation of cell 
replication, play an essential role.” Even to day, the tissue-specific effects of 4-ABP can 
neither be answered by specific mutations or mutation rate nor by selective advantage. 
After so many years of research about one of th e first classified human carcinogens it still 
seems unlikely that a critical pathway can be found that leads from exposure to cell 
transformation and tumour development. However, the data collected thus far support a 
common mode of action for many aromatic amines, in which genotoxic effects and 
toxicity both have a role. This mode of action is defined as interaction with cellular 
regulation pathways. In their review, Cohen et al.  (2006) call it “synergy of DNA 
reactivity and cell proliferation.” The empha sis so far has been on DNA-reactivity. The 
role of toxicity and the underlying bioc hemistry and molecula r biology has been 
neglected and is essentially unknown. Epidemio logy and animal experiments support the 
classification of 4-ABP as carcinogenic to human s. The toxicological profile shows many 
properties typical for the group of carcinoge nic aromatic amines and their common mode 
of action. Since 4-ABP and 4-nitrobiphenyl are present in the general environment, any 
further assessment requires more knowledge about the background  exposure and the 
incremental contribution  of specific sources. 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
4-Aminobiphenyl was formerly used as a ru bber oxidant, as a dye intermediate and 
for the detection of sulfates. Cu rrently it is only used for research purposes. Its production 
has been prohibited in th e European Union since 1998 and ceased in the USA in the 
1950s. 4-Aminobiphenyl is still produced in some countries and supplied to countries 
where it is no longer produced. 4-Aminobiphenyl may occur as a contaminant in 
2-aminodiphenyl, in some cosmetic colour ad ditives, in hair dyes and in the fungicide  4-AMINOBIPHENYL 99  
 diphenylamine. Occupational exposure may occur during production and use of the 
compound. The main sources of exposure for the general population are tobacco smoking 
and environmental tobacco smoke, although the use of hair dye contaminated with 
4-aminobiphenyl is also a potential source of exposure. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
Excesses of bladder-cancer risk have been foun d in a case series and a cohort study in 
workers producing and using many chemical s including 4-aminobiphenyl. The most 
marked excess of bladder can cer occurred in workers ex posed to 4-aminobiphenyl. 
Chance, bias and confounding from othe r chemical exposures or smoking offer no 
credible explanation fo r these increased risks. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
4-Aminobiphenyl was tested for carcinogeni city by oral administration in mice, 
rabbits and dogs, and by subcutaneous administration in rats. Following its oral 
administration, it induced bladder papillomas and carcinomas in rabbits and dogs, and neoplasms at various sites in  mice, including dose-related increases in the incidences of 
angiosarcomas, hepatocellular tumours a nd bladder carcinomas. When administered 
subcutaneously to rats, it induced tumours of the intestine. When administered by intraperitoneal injectio n to newborn mice or CYP1A2-null  mice, it caused an increase in 
the incidence of liver tumours. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
The bioactivation of 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) in vitro , in experimental animals and 
in humans is well documented. The geno toxic metabolite that binds to DNA is 
N-hydroxy-4-ABP; its oxidised derivative 4-nitrosobiphenyl binds to haemoglobin. 
Human CYP1A2 displays the highest catal ytic activity of the P450 enzymes for 
N-oxidation of 4-ABP; however, extrahep atic CYPs, peroxidases and prostaglandin H 
synthase (PHS) can catalyse bioact ivation within target sites. N-acetylation is an 
important detoxification pathway of 4-ABP. Some epidemiological investigations on 
aromatic amine exposure have reported that individuals who are slow NAT2 N-
acetylators are at elevated risk for bladder cancer, and 4-ABP has been implicated as one 
of the causal agents. More recent studies have established that NAT2 is the enzyme 
responsible for the observed differences. Elevated levels of 4-ABP haemoglobin- or 
DNA-adducts have been detected in these populations and support a role for 4-ABP in urinary bladder cancer and possibly other cancers. 100 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

  AURAMINE AND AURAMINE PRODUCTION 115  
 
 1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
The diphenylmethane dyes are usually grouped with the triarylmethane dyes. The 
dyes of the diphenylmethane subclass are keto imine derivatives, and include auramine O 
(hydrochloride salt). These dyes are still used ex tensively for the colouration of paper and 
in the preparation of pigment lakes (Thetford, 2000). 
Auramine and its salts can be ma nufactured by first heating 4,4’-
bis(dimethylaminodiphenyl)methane (Michler’s base; CAS No. 101–61–1) with a mixture of urea, sulfamic acid, and sulfur in ammonia at 175°C. The auramine sulfate 
formed in the reaction may be used directly in  the dyeing process or can be converted into 
auramine base or auramine hydrochloride (auramine O). Highly concentrated solutions for use in the paper industry can be prepared  by dissolving auramine base in formamide 
containing sodium bisulfate. The nitrate and nitrite salts exhibit excellent solubility in 
alcohols, which facilitates their use in lacque rs and flexographic printing colours (Kirsch 
et al. , 1978; Thetford, 2000). 
Production of auramine took place first in  Europe (Switzerland, Germany, United 
Kingdom, France), and later also in the USA.  Production in these locations has generally 
been discontinued. Auramine manufacturing is currently mainly located in India and 
China. 
In 1993, approximately 9000 tonnes of basic diphenylmethane and triphenylmethane 
dyes were sold. Crystal violet, methyl violet, malachite green, auramine, and Rhodamine 
B are suitable for many purposes and are among the economically most important dyes. 
Auramine O and its ethyl homologue, ethylauramine, are brilliant yellow dyes with high colour strength. Worldwide an nual sales of these dyes ar e approximately 1000 tonnes 
(Gessner & Mayer, 2000). 
Information was collected from 1996 to 1998 in Europe fo r the IUCLID database for 
substances with a production or import volu me between 10 and 1000 tonnes/year (Low 
Production Volume Chemicals (LPVCs)). Aura mine hydrochloride was included on the 
list of LPVCs (Allanou et al. , 1999; European Commission, 2008). 
The USEPA (2003, 2007) Inventory Update Rule regulation requires manufacturers 
and importers of certain chemical substances listed in the TSCA Chemical Substance 
Inventory to report manufacturing inform ation (aggregate production volumes) for 
chemicals manufactured (including those imported) in amounts of 10 000 pounds or 
greater (in 1986) or 25 000 pounds or greater (in 2003) at a single site. Table 1.2 presents 
the aggregate production volumes that were reported for auramine hydrochloride. 
Available information indicates that auramine was produced and/or supplied in 
research quantities in the follow ing countries: Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region, 
India, the People’s Republic of China, and the USA (Chemical Sources International, 
2008). 116 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Available information indicates that aurami ne hydrochloride was produced and/or 
supplied in research qu antities in the following countri es: Canada, Germany, Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region, India, Japa n, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United

1.2.2  Use 
Auramine dyes are used for dyeing of leather, jute, tanned cotton, and paints, and as 
dye components in inking ribbons, ballpoint pastes, oils and waxes, and carbon paper. The most important areas of appl ication are in dyeing paper an d in flexographic printing. 
For the latter, a large number of salts are produced, which have a high solubility in 
ethanol and ethanol-water mixtures (e.g. nitrates, nitrites, bromides, iodides, salts of alkyl-, aralkyl-, or arylsulfonic acids, thio cyanates, and phosphates). For dyeing paper, 
solutions of the hydrochloride in organic solvents (e.g., thiodiglycol) are employed, and 
tartaric and citric acids have been used as st abilizers. The chlorides can also be converted 
into more easily soluble acetates or propionates to obtain highly con centrated solutions. 
The hydrogen sulfates of auramine are also  readily soluble. Co loured salts based on 
auramine with tannic acid, phosphomolybd ic acid, and preferably phosphotungsto-
molybdic acid are used as yellow toner pi gments for the development of latent 
electrostatic images (Fierz-D avid & Blagey, 1949; Gessner  & Mayer, 2000; Thetford, 
2000; Varella et al. , 2005). 
Auramine was used as a fluorescent staining  agent to stain acid-fast bacteria in 
sputum or infected tissue, and also in comb ination with the dye r hodamine in the Truant 
auramine-rhodamine stain for Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Silver et al. , 1966). 
Auramine was historically used as a component in brilliantine, a grooming product 
intended to soften men's hair (Gubéran et al. , 1985), particularly in the 1930s, which 
could have resulted in occupational exposure as well as customer exposure to auramine.  AURAMINE AND AURAMINE PRODUCTION 117  
 
 Auramine has also been used in some countries as a food colourant (D’Aquino & 
Santini, 1977). Auramine has been detected in a small percentage of food samples from 
India (Tripathi et al. , 2007), including fresh peas (Rao & Bhat, 2003). In China, auramine 
has been detected in bean  products (Lin, 2007). 
Auramine has been used to colour smoke, in  military applications (Department of the 
Army, 1990) and in firework displays (Shimizu, 1981). 
1.3 Occurrence and exposure 
1.3.1  Natural and environmental occurrence 
Auramine is not known to occur as a natural product. 
No data have been reported on levels of auramine in environmental matrices such as 
water and soil. 
1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
The US National Occupational exposure survey (1981–1983) estimated that about 
19 000 workers were exposed to auramine. The industries with th e largest numbers of 
exposed workers included the paper and allied products industry, and the health services 
industry (laboratory workers) (NIOSH, 1990). 
The only well-described groups of workers exposed to auramine include British (Case 
& Pearson, 1954) and German auramine production workers (Kirsch et al. , 1978; Thiess 
et al. , 1982). Case reports of bladder cancer among Swiss auramine-production workers 
have also been published (Müller, 1933). Among a cohort of 4772 laboratory workers, 
8% were reported to have been exposed to auramine and its salts (Kauppinen et al. , 
2003). Exposure measurements in the work place or biological samples of workers 
employed in the production of auramine are not available. 
The manufacture of auramine involves pote ntial exposure to its process chemicals 
(e.g., dimethylaniline, formaldehyde, sulfur, ammonium chloride, ammonia, Michler’s base), as well as to other chemicals used and produced at the same location (e.g., 
benzidine, 1-naphthylamine, 2- naphthylamine, magenta, anil ine) (Case & Pearson, 1954).

2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
2.1 Case report 
Müller (1933) described two cases of bladde r cancer in men occupied in auramine 
manufacture. 
2.2 Cohort studies 
Case & Pearson (1954) showed a relatively  high incidence of bladder tumours in 
238 workers engaged in the manufacture of auramine, with a latent period ranging between 9 and 28 years. Care had been taken to eliminate workers wh o were recorded as 
also having been in contact with benzidine, 1-naphthylamine, or 2-naphthylamine. 
Overall, there were six death certificates me ntioning bladder tumours, where only 0.45 
would have been expected from the overall male population of England and Wales (SMR 
13.3, 95% CI: 4.9–29.0). 
A mortality study was conducted among 191 workers who had been employed for 
> 1 month in auramine production at the Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik (BASF) in 
Ludwigshafen (Federal Republic of Germany, FRG) during the period 1932–1976. 
Subjects were followed-up until death or until 15–08–1976, whichever came first. A total of 20 workers were lost to follow-up. The mort ality in the group was compared with those 
in the populations of Ludwigshafen (1970– 1973), in the district of Rheinhessen-Pfalz 
(1970–1975), and in the FRG (1971–1974). A comparison with another group of workers in the plant could not be made. Among a total of 45 deaths, ten were the result of 
malignant tumours (proportional mortality ratio 1.35, compared with FRG). The tumours 
occurred in the bladder ( n = 2), lung ( n = 2), prostate ( n = 3), and stomach ( n = 3). All ten  AURAMINE AND AURAMINE PRODUCTION 121  
 
 cases had been employed before 1950, and six of them before 1940. Co-exposure to 1- 
and 2-naphthylamine could not be excluded (Kirsch et al. , 1978). 
A cohort of 703 male and 677 female hairdr essers born in or afte r 1880 who started to 
run salons in Geneva between 1900 and 1964 was followed-up to the end of 1982. Cause-
specific mortality was analysed for the period 1942–1982 using sex-, age- and year-
specific death rates for Switzerland as the re ference; a significant excess mortality from 
bladder cancer (observed deaths, 10; expected, 3.9) was found among males. Cancer 
incidence recorded fo r the years 1970–1980 showed a significant increase among males 
for all neoplasms (obs, 65; exp, 51.4), for cancer of the buccal cavity and pharynx (obs, 6; exp, 2.5), for cancer of the prostate (obs, 12; exp, 6.1), and for bladder cancer (obs, 11; 
exp, 5.3). Among female hairdressers, bla dder cancer was observed in two cases, where 
1.5 would be expected. It was suggested th at the excess in male hairdressers might be 
related to some colouring agent(s) in brilli antines, which were widely used in men's 
hairdressing salons in Geneva until about 1950. Auramine was one of the commonly used 
dyes in brilliantines during the 1930s. Howeve r, the impurities of dyes raise the concern 
that the extra deaths from blad der cancer could have been caused by other agents, e.g., 2-
naphthylamine, a known human bladder carcinogen (Gubéran et al. , 1985). 
3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
3.1 Auramine 
3.1.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse 
Thirty mice (15 males, 15 fema les; strain and age unspecified) were given a diet 
containing 0.1% of commercial auramine (BDH ; purity unspecified) in arachis oil for 52 
weeks (estimated total intake, 728 mg per anim al), and kept for their life-span. Nineteen 
mice died before termination of the experime nt (90 weeks). In th e treated group, seven 
mice (23%) developed hepatomas and 11 (3 7%) developed lymphomas, compared with 
none and five (8%), respectively, in 60 cont rol animals treated with arachis oil only. One 
subcutaneous sarcoma was also repo rted in the treated group (Bonser et al. , 1956). 
A group of thirty stock mice (15 males, 15 females) was given 0.1% auramine, and a 
group of 27 CBA mice (12 males, 15 females) was given 0.2% auramine (BDH; purity 
not specified) dissolved in acetone in the di et for 52 weeks (approximate total estimated 
intake, 1820 mg and 3640 mg per mouse, respectively). In stock mice, four of the seven 
(57%) males and three of the 10 (30%) fema les that survived to  tumour-bearing age 
showed hepatomas. No hepatomas were seen in 16 stock control mice. In CBA mice, 
seven of 12 males (58%) and 11 of 15 femal es (73%) that survived to tumour-bearing age 
showed hepatomas. Seven of 90 CBA control mice developed hepatomas (Walpole, 
1963). 122 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 (b) Rat 
Twelve male Wilmslow-Wistar rats were given a diet containing 0.1% of commercial 
auramine (ICI Ltd; purity not specified) for 87  weeks (estimated total intake, 10 g per rat), 
followed by normal diet until death. Eleven animals (92%) developed hepatomas between 
the 91st and the 122nd week after the start of  treatment. Twelve control rats were tumour-
free at death between 90 and 120 weeks (W illiams & Bonser, 1962; Walpole, 1963). 
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (age 50–55 days) received a single dose of 150 mg 
auramine O (source not clear) in sesame oil by oral gavage and were autopsied after six 
months. No tumours were seen in 19 rats obs erved. Another group received an oral dose 
of 80 mg per animal every three days between  40 and 70 days of age (total dose, 800 
mg/rat), followed by autopsy after nine m onths. No tumours were seen in 15 animals 
observed (Griswold et al. , 1966, 1968). 
Groups of 40 Sprague-Dawley rats (20 females, 20 males) received technical grade 
auramine (BASF; purity, 87%) at 0, 50, 100 and 200 ppm in the diet for 24 months. In 
these four dose groups, tumour s (benign and malignant combin ed) were seen in 6, 13, 8 
and 10 male rats, respectively, and in 19, 18, 15 and 19 female rats. The corresponding 
total numbers of tumours were 12 (one malignant), 15 (none malignant), nine (none 
malignant), and 10 (two malignant) in male rats, respectively, and 34 (four malignant), 41 (6), 36 (4), and 53 (6) in females, respectiv ely. The tumour induction was not statistically 
significant (Kirsch et al. , 1978). 
(c) Other animal species 
(i) Rabbit 
In a preliminary comparative experiment, nine rabbits (strain unspecified) were given 
auramine (source and purity not stated) orally (dose and dose regimen not given) to the limit of tolerance, and the treatment was conti nued until the onset of the final illness. Six 
animals were sacrificed in the first two years,  and three between three and four years after 
the start of treatment. Metaplasia of the urinary tract epitheli um, suggestive of pre-
cancerous change, was seen in two of five (40%) rabbits examined. No tumours were 
seen in control and treated animals (Bonser, 1 962). [The Working group noted the lack of 
experimental details.] 
(ii) Dog 
No abnormalities were detected in dogs (str ain not specified) given auramine (source 
and purity not stated) orally (dose not given)  daily for about seven years (total ingested 
amount, 66 g per animal) (Walpole, 1963). [The Working Group noted the lack of 
description of experimental design and lack of use of controls.]  AURAMINE AND AURAMINE PRODUCTION 123  
 
 3.1.2  Subcutaneous administration 
(a) Rat 
Twenty-four male Wilmslow Wistar ra ts, 8–10 weeks of age, were given 
subcutaneous injections (0.1 mL per 100 g bw) of a 2.5% suspension of commercial 
auramine (purity not specified) in arachis oil on five days per week for 21 weeks 
(estimated total dose, 110–120 mg per animal). In 20 surviving animal s, 11 fibrosarcomas 
(tumour yield: 55%) and three hepatomas (tumour yield: 15%) were observed. Three 
intestinal carcinomas were also reported (Williams & Bonser, 19 62). [The Working 
Group noted that no control data were given.] 
3.2 Michler’s base 
3.2.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse 
A bioassay for the possible car cinogenicity of technical -grade Michler’s base was 
conducted with B6C3 F1 mice. Michler’s base was administ ered in the feed, at either of 
two concentrations, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals. The high and low dietary concentrations of Michler’s base were, respectively, 2500 and 1250 ppm for the 
two sexes. Twenty animals of each sex were  placed on test as co ntrols. The compound 
was administered for 78 weeks,  followed by an observation period of 13 weeks. There 
were no significantly positive associations be tween the concentrations of Michler’s base 
administered and mortality among mice of either sex. Adequate numbers of animals 
survived sufficiently long to be at risk from late-developing tumours. The mean body weights of dosed mice were significantly lowe r than those of the controls. There were 
elevated incidences of hepatocellular ade nomas in dosed mice when compared with 
controls (i.e., 2/20 (10%), 3/50 (6%), and 16/48 (33%) in control, low-dose, and high-dose males, respectively; and 1/19 (5%), 18/49 (37%), and 22/48 (46%) in control, low-
dose, and high-dose females, respectively). The incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas 
in dosed mice did not differ greatly from those in controls. Among both sexes of mice, there was a significant positive association be tween the concentrations of the chemical 
administered and the incidences of a comb ination of hepatocellular adenomas and 
hepatocellular carcinomas. For male mice, th e Fisher exact-test comparisons were not 
significant; however, for females, both the comparisons of high-dose with control and 
low-dose with control were sign ificant. Under the conditions of this bioassay, Michler’s 
base was carcinogenic in female B6C3F1 mi ce, inducing liver neoplasms (National 
Cancer Institute, 1979a). 
(b) Rat 
A bioassay for the possible car cinogenicity of technical -grade Michler’s base was 
conducted with Fisher 344 rats. Michler’s base was administered in the feed, at either of 124 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 two concentrations, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals. The high and low 
dietary concentrations of Michler’s base were , respectively, 750 and 375 ppm for the two 
sexes. Twenty animals of each sex were place d on test as controls. The compound was 
administered for 59 weeks, followed by an observation period of 45 weeks. There were 
no significantly positive associations betw een the concentrations of Michler’s base 
administered and mortality among rats of either sex. Adequate numbers of animals 
survived sufficiently long to be at risk from late-developing tumours. There was slight 
dose-related mean body-weight depression among female rats, the mean body weight of high-dose male rats was slightly less than that  for controls. For both male and female rats, 
there was a significant positive association be tween the concentrations of Michler’s base 
administered and the incidences of follicular-cell carcinomas of the thyroid (i.e., 1/18 
(6%), 4/50 (8%), and 21/46 (46%) in the control, low-dose, and high-dose males, 
respectively; and 0/20, 3/46 (7%), and 23/45 (51%) in the control, low-dose, and high-
dose females, respectively). The high-dose to control Fisher exact-test comparisons were 
also significant for each sex. Under the condit ions of this bioassay, Michler’s base was 
carcinogenic in Fisher 344 rats, inducing thyroid follicular-cell carcinomas in both males 
and females (National Cancer Institute, 1979a). 
3.3 Michler’s ketone 
3.3.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse  
A bioassay for the possible carcinogenicity of  technical-grade Michler's ketone was 
conducted with B6C3 F1 mice. Michler's ketone was admini stered in the feed, at either of 
two concentrations, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals. The high and low dietary concentrations of Michler's ketone were 2500 and 1250 ppm, respectively, for 
mice of both sexes. Twenty animals of each sex were placed on test as controls. The 
compound was administered fo r 78 weeks. The period of compound administration was 
followed by an observation period of 13 weeks. There were significant positive 
associations between the concentrations of Mich ler's ketone administer ed and mortality in 
mice of both sexes. Adequate numbers of animals in all groups survived sufficiently long to be at risk from late-developing tumours.  There was distinct do se-related mean body-
weight depression in mice of both sexes. There were significant positive associations 
between the concentrations of Michler's ketone administered and the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in female mice and haemangiosarcomas in male mice. 
Incidences in hepatocellular carci nomas in females were: 0/19 ( P for trend < 0.001), 
16/49 (33%), and 38/50 (56%), for incr easing doses, respectiv ely. Incidences in 
haemangiosarcomas in males were: 0/19 ( P for trend < 0.001), 5/50 (10%), and 20/50 
(40%), for increasing doses, re spectively. In all of these cases the high-dose to control 
Fisher exact-test comparison  of incidences was also sign ificant (P < 0.001) (National 
Cancer Institute, 1979b).  AURAMINE AND AURAMINE PRODUCTION 125  
 
 (b) Rat 
A bioassay for the possible carcinogenicity of  technical-grade Michler's ketone was 
conducted with Fischer 344 rats. Michler's ketone was admi nistered in the feed, at either 
of two concentrations, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals. The high and low dietary concentrations of Michler's ketone were, respectively, 500 and 250 ppm for male 
rats, and 1000 and 500 ppm for female rats. Twenty animals of each sex were placed on 
test as controls. The compound was administer ed for 78 weeks. The period of compound 
administration was followed by an observation period of 28 weeks for male and high-
dose female rats, and 29 weeks for low-dose fe male rats. There were significant positive 
associations between the concentrations of Mich ler's ketone administer ed and mortality in 
rats of both sexes. Adequate numbers of anim als in all groups surv ived sufficiently long 
to be at risk of late-developing tumours.  There was distinct do se-related mean body-
weight depression in female rats, and the mean body weight among dosed male rats was slightly lower than that in controls. There we re significant positive  associations between 
the concentrations of Michler's ketone administered and the incidences of hepatocellular 
carcinomas in both sexes of rats. Incidences in males were: 0/20 ( p for trend < 0.001), 
9/50 (18%), and 40/50 (80%) for increasing doses, respectively. Incidences in females 
were: 0/20 ( p for trend < 0.001), 41/47 (87%), an d 44/49 (90%), for increasing doses, 
respectively. In all of these cases the high-dose to control Fisher  exact-test comparison of 
incidences was also significant ( P < 0.001) (National Cancer Institute, 1979b). 
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination 
No data were available to the Working Group. 
4.2 Genetic and related effects (see Table 4.1 for details)  
[Some general comments on the data in Table 4.1: a) results were obtained with 
commercial (“technical grade”) auramine, the grade of purity presumably varying from 
65% to 85%; b) purified auramine was tested only in th e study by Parodi et al.  (1982), 
together with the tech nical-grade product.] 
Commercial preparations of auramine gave a positive outcome in the prophage-
induction test in the presence of metabolic activation (Ho & Ho, 1981). They were 
mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA98, TA1535, TA1538, and YG10, but 
only in the presence of metabo lic activation. The effect w as observed in four of nine 
studies with TA98 (Parodi et al. , 1981; Nagao & Takahashi, 1981; Zeiger et al. , 1992; 
Varella et al. , 2005), in one of four studies with TA1535 (Richold & Jones, 1981), in four 
of six studies with TA1538 (Rowland & Se vern, 1981; Richold & Jones, 1981; Simmon  126 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 & Shepherd, 1981; Zeiger et al. , 1992), and in one study with YG10 (Varella et al. , 
2004). Commercial auramine gave a negativ e outcome in both the absence and the 
presence of metabolic activation in eight studies, and in one study in the absence of 
metabolic activation (Ichinotsubo et al. , 1981), with TA100 (Brams et al. , 1987; Kier 
et al. , 1986; Simmon, 1979a; Richold & Jon es, 1981; Venitt & Crofton-Sleigh, 1981; 
Zeiger et al. , 1992; Varella et al. , 2004; Hakura et al. , 2005), in three studies with 
TA1537 (Simmon, 1979a; Kier et al. , 1986; Richold & Jones, 1981). It also gave a 
negative outcome in both the absence and the presence of metabolic activation (Rosenkranz & Poirier, 1979) and in the absence of metabolic activation 
(Rosenkranz et al. , 1976) with TA 1535 and TA1538. Auramine induced forward 
mutation in S. typhimurium  in the presence of metabolic activation (Skopek et al. , 
1981). In both the absence and the presence of metabolic activation it was non-mutagenic 
in two studies with E. coli  (Venitt & Crofton-Sleigh, 1981; Gatehouse, 1981), and gave 
equivocal results in the Bacillus subtilis  multigene test (Macgregor & Sacks, 1976). 
In studies with Saccharomyces cereviasiae , auramine (technical grade) induced 
deletions (Schiestl et al. , 1989), gene conversion (Sharp & Parry, 1981a; Zimmermann & 
Scheel, 1981), homozygosis (Simmon, 1979b) and aneuploidy (Parry & Sharp, 1981) in the absence of metabolic activation, but it did not produce intrachromosomal 
recombination (Schiestl et al. , 1989) and reverse mutation (M ehta & von Borstel, 1981). 
Auramine (technical grade) gave a positive resu lt  in the differential toxicity assay, both in 
the absence and the presence of metabolic activ ation (Sharp & Parry, 1981b). It induced 
aneuploidy in wheat (Rédei & Sandhu, 1988). Auramine did not induce intra-
chromosomal mitotic recombination in D. melanogaster  (Consuegra et al. , 1996). 
In cultured, non-human mammalian cells, both positive and negative results were 
obtained. Commercial auramine induced DNA st rand breaks in primary cultures of rat 
hepatocytes (Sina et al. , 1983; Martelli et al. , 1998). In the pr esence of metabolic 
activation, mutations were induced at the Hprt (Fassina et al. , 1990) but not at the Tk 
(Amacher et al. , 1980) locus, sister chromatid exch ange was induced in Chinese hamster 
cells (Perry & Thomson, 1981), and morpho logical transformation in Syrian hamster 
embryo cells (Pienta & Kawalek, 1981). Ce ll transformation was also observed in the 
absence of metabolic activation (Pienta et al. , 1977). Micronucleus formation was 
observed in Syrian hamster embryo cells in the absence of metabolic activation (Fritzenschaf et al. , 1993), but not in primary rat hepatocytes (Martelli et al. , 1998). 
Auramine induced DNA strand-b reaks in the human cell line  HuF22 in the absence of 
metabolic activation (Parodi et al. , 1982), and it caused DNA fragmentation but not 
micronucleus formation in primary human hepatocytes (Martelli et al. , 1998). 
In vivo , auramine gave negative results in a host-mediated assay with microbial cells 
(Simmon et al. , 1979). It induced DNA fragmentation in the liver (Parodi et al. , 1981; 
Brambilla et al. , 1985; Martelli et al. , 1998; Parodi et al. , 1982; Kitchin & Brown, 1994), 
in the kidney (Parodi et al. , 1982) and in the urinary bladder of rats (Martelli et al. , 1998). 
In mice, DNA fragmentation was induced in th e liver, kidney and lung, but not in the 
spleen (Sasaki et al. , 1997); in the bone marrow, contrasting results were obtained in two  AURAMINE AND AURAMINE PRODUCTION 133  
 
 studies (Sasaki et al. , 1997; Parodi et al. , 1982). In mice, aurami ne did not induce sister 
chromatid exchange in bone-marrow cells (Parodi et al. , 1982, 1983) and it gave a 
negative outcome in the micronucleus test (Salamone et al. , 1981). 
Taken as a whole, the results listed in Tabl e 4.1, obtained with commercial auramine, 
show that this compound is potentially mutagenic and genotoxic, but only in the presence 
of an appropriate system of metabolic activ ation. Importantly, purified auramine was 
inactive in tests for induction of DNA fragmentation in rat liver and induction of sister 
chromatid exchange in bone-marrow cells of mice. 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
Auramine is manufactured in two steps by reaction of N,N-dimethylaniline with 
formaldehyde to form Michler’s base, follow ed by reaction of this intermediate with 
ammonium chloride and sulfur in the presen ce of ammonia. This process can lead to 
auramine that contains Michler’s ketone, probably from the hydrolysis of the target dye. 
Auramine is used as a colourant for paper and inks, to a lesser degree for textiles and 
leather, in laboratories as a biological stain, and to colour smoke. Auramine is not known to occur in nature. Occupational exposure to auramine can occur during its production or 
during its use in paper and allied products indus tries. Auramine has been detected in food 
samples from India, including fresh peas, and in  bean products in China. The production 
of auramine is prohibited in Europe and the USA; its manufacture continues mainly in 
India and China. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
A single landmark study in the United  Kingdom has shown a marked excess of 
bladder cancer in workers engaged in the ma nufacture of auramine. Workers exposed to 
benzidine and β-naphthylamine were excluded. Studie s are not available to evaluate the 
role of pure auramine in carcinogenicity. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
Auramine (technical-grade) was tested for car cinogenicity by oral administration in 
mice, rats, rabbits and dogs, and by subcutaneous injection in rats. Following its oral 
administration, it induced hepatomas and ly mphomas in mice and hepatomas in rats. The 
studies in rabbits and dogs were inadequate for evaluation. After subcutaneous injection 
in one study in rats, it induced local sarcomas. In a well-designed study, dietary 
administration of Michler’s ketone caused an increased incidence of hepatocellular 134 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 carcinomas in male and female rats and fema le mice, and of hemangiosarcomas in male 
mice. In a well-designed study, dietary admi nistration of Michler’s base caused increased 
incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and adenomas in mice and follicular-cell 
carcinomas of the thyroid in rats. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
There are no data on the toxicokinetics of auramine. 
In genotoxicity tests, purifi ed auramine was used in on e study only, along with the 
technical-grade product. The purified sample [composition not analysed] was inactive in 
inducing in-vivo DNA fragmentation in rat liver and sister chromatid exchange in mouse 
bone-marrow cells. All other data on mutagenicity and genotoxicity of auramine were 
obtained with commercial preparations of the compound with varying degrees of purity, 
which presumably was never higher than 85%.  This may explain the variability of the 
results reported. 
Taken as a whole, the results show that commercial auramine is potentially mutagenic 
and genotoxic both in bacteria and cultured cells in the presence of metabolic activation. 
In one study, purified auramine was inac tive in a test to assess DNA fragmentation. 
In in-vivo experiments in rats and mice, the technical-grade auramine induced liver-
DNA fragmentation in four of five experime nts; it was also positive in this assay in 
urinary bladder cells of the rat, weakly positive in kidney and lung cells of the mouse, but 
negative in mouse spleen and bone-marrow cells.

1.5 Analysis 
Analytical studies on benzidine began in th e 1950s. Recent studi es include the use of 
gas chromatography/mass spectrome try (GC/MS) to detect very  low (ppm-ppb) levels in 
water and paint samples. While GC analysis invariably requires derivatization of the 
amine before the analysis, analysis by liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with 
mass spectrometry does not. Also, the use of modern LC -MS/MS methods permits the 
analysis of complex mixtures. Table 1.1 pr esents a selection of recent studies on the 
analysis of benzidine and benzidin e-based dyes in various matrices.

 1.6 Production 
1.6.1  Benzidine and benzidine-based dyes 
(a) Benzidine 
Benzidine and its substitution products ( ortho -tolidine [3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine], 3,3 ′-
dichlorobenzidine, and ortho- dianisidine [3,3 ′-dimethoxylbenzidine]) represent the group 
called the diphenyl bases. They are used main ly as intermediates in the production of azo 
dyes and azo pigments. Symmetrically or asymmetrically coupled products can be 
produced by simultaneous or successive diaz otization (coupling), respectively. The 
diphenyl bases have been of interest as cross-linking agents, e.g., in polyurethane plastics, in which they can noticeably increase temperat ure stability. The diphenyl radical has a 
chain-stiffening effect in polyamides. The ability of th e diphenyl bases to react with 
numerous cations, anions, and or ganic substances, such as oxidi zing agents and blood, is 
used for analytical and diagnostic purposes (Schwenecke & Mayer, 2005). 
Benzidine and the other diphenyl bases ar e produced in thre e separate processing 
stages: 1) reduction of nitro groups to form hydrazo compounds; 2) benzidine rearrangement; 3) isolation of the bases. Be nzidine has been produ ced from nitrobenzene 
on an industrial scale since ab out 1880. Commercial producti on methods include alkaline 
iron reduction, amalgam reduction, and electrochemical reduction. The resultant 
hydrazobenzene is rearranged with hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid during cooling. The 
base is then isolated in the form of benzid ine hydrochloride or be nzidine sulfate. The 
conversion of these salts to th e free base is avoided as much as possible because of the 
chronic toxicity of benzidine (Schwenecke & Mayer, 2005). 
The most important reaction commercially  is the diazotization of the two amino 
groups. Reaction with nitrous acid converts be nzidine into the tetrazonium compound, in 
which the first diazonium group is coupled very vigorously whereas the second reacts 
more slowly. As a result it is possible to produce asymmetrical diazo dyes. Gradual 
diazotization is also possible (Schwenecke & Mayer, 2005). 
The manufacturing of benzidine is prohibited in several countries, e.g., Japan, 
Republic of Korea, Canada and Switzerland  (UN/UNEP/FAO, 2009). According to EU 
legislation, the manufacture of benzidine has been prohibited in Europe since 1998 (European Commission, 1998). 
Benzidine is no longer manufactured for co mmercial purposes in the USA. All large-
scale production was discontinued in 1976, and only small quan tities remain available for 
use in diagnostic testing. Estimated US benzidine production in 1983 was 500 pounds 
(227 kg) (possibly excluding some captive pr oduction), compared with 10 million pounds 
(4500 tonnes) in 1972 (ATSDR, 2001). 
Available information indicates that benzidine was produced and/or supplied in 
research quantities in the following countries: Germ any, Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, India, the People’s Republic of China, Switzerland, and the USA  BENZIDINE 159  
 (Chem Sources-International, 2010). Available information indicates that benzidine 
hydrochloride was produced and/or supplied in research quantities in the following 
countries: Belgium, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, India, Switzerland, and the USA (Chem So urces-International, 2010). 
(b) Benzidine-based dyes 
Benzidine-based dyes were pr oduced in commercial quantit ies in the United States 
starting no later than 1914. Total production in the USA reach ed 14 million kg (31 million 
pounds) in 1948, which dropped to about 2.9 million kg (6.4  million pounds) in 1976 and 
about 780 000 kg (1.7 million  pounds) in 1978 (IARC, 1982).  In 1978, Direct Black 38 
accounted for about 48% of the pr oduction, followed by Direct  Blue 2 (12.8% ) and Direct 
Green 6 (6.4%). In 1974, nine manufacturer s produced benzidine-based dyes; by 1979, 
only one manufacturer remained, producing 17 benzidine-based dyes (NTP, 2005a). 
Information was collected in Europe from 1996 to 1998 for the IUCLID database for 
substances with a production or import volu me between 10 and 1000 tonnes/year (Low 
Production Volume Chemicals (LPVCs)). Direct  Black 38 was included on the list of 
LPVCs (Allanou et al. , 1999; European Commission, 2008). 
Available information indicates that Direct  Black 38 was produced and/or supplied in 
research quantities in the following countries: Germ any, Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the USA (Chem Sources-
International, 2010). 
Direct Blue 6 was produced and/or supplie d in research quantiti es in the following 
countries: Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, India, Japan, and the 
USA (Chem Sources-International, 2010). 
Direct Brown 95 was produced and/or supplied in research quantities in the following 
countries: India, Japan, and the US A (Chem Sources-International, 2010). 
1.6.2  Dimethylbenzidine and dime thylbenzidine-based dyes 
(a) 3,3
′-Dimethylbenzidine 
ortho -Nitrotoluene undergoes alkali ne reduction with zinc dust , electrolytic reduction, 
or catalytic reduction to form 2,2 ′-dimethylhydrazobenzene. This is rearranged in dilute 
hydrochloric acid or 20% sulfuric acid at 5–50◦C. The free base (3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine) 
or the dihydrochloride can be isolated (Schwenecke & Mayer, 2005). 
In 1978, the major company producing 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine in the USA ceased 
production; its annual production had averaged approximately 200 000 pounds (NTP, 2005b). The USEPA (2003, 2007) Inventor y Update Rule regulation requires 
manufacturers and importers of certain chemical  substances listed in the TSCA Chemical 
Substance Inventory to report manufacturing information (aggregate production volumes) for chemicals manufactured (including imported ) in amounts of 10 000 pounds or greater 
(in 1986) or 25 000 pounds or greater (in 2003) at a single site. Table 1.2 presents the 160 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 aggregate production volumes that were reported for 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine 
dihydrochloride. 3,3 ′-Dimethylbenzidine was included  on the list of LPVCs (Allanou et 
al., 1999; European Commission, 2008). 
Available information indicates that 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine was produced or supplied 
in the following countries: Canada, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
India, Japan, the Netherlands, the People’s Re public of China, South Africa, Switzerland, 
and the USA (Chem Sources -International, 2010).

Acid Red 114 can be prepared by coupling ortho -tolidine [3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine] to 
phenol, which is then coupled to G-acid (2-naphthol-6,8-disulfonic acid), followed by 
reaction of the phenolic  hydroxyl group with para-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Chudgar & 
Oakes, 2003). Acid Red 114 was incl uded on the list of LPVCs (Allanou et al. , 1999;

1.6.3  Dichlorobenzidine 
3,3′-Dichlorobenzidine is commercially produced by reduction of ortho -nitrochloro-
benzene to form a hydrazo compound, which is rearranged in the presence of mineral 
acids to form 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine (Schwenecke & Mayer, 2005). The commercial 
product is usually provided in the form of the dihydrochloride salt because of its greater stability. 3,3 ′-Dichlorobenzidine dihydrochloride was included on the list of HPVCs with 
a range of 10 000 to 50 000 tonnes (Allanou et al. , 1999; European Commission, 2000).

1.7 Use 
1.7.1  Benzidine and benzidine-based dyes 
(a) Benzidine 
Benzidine has been used sin ce the 1850s as the reagent b ase for the production of a 
large number of dyes, particularly azo dyes  for wool, cotton, an d leather. However, 
because benzidine was found in the 1970s to be carcinogenic to humans, there has been a 
considerable decline in the use of the be nzidine dyes. Benzidine is used for the 
quantitative determination of sulfuric acid and for the detection and determination of 
numerous anions and metal ions. The reaction of  benzidine with pyri dine in the presence 
of elemental chlorine is suitable for detect ing traces of free chlorine or pyridine in 
drinking-water. The green to blue colourati on that occurs when benzidine reacts with 
hydrogen peroxide in the presen ce of peroxidases can be used to detect blood. Benzidine 
still plays a role in many chemical syntheses (Schwenecke & Mayer, 2005). 
In the past, benzidine also has been used as a rubber compounding agent, in the 
manufacture of plastic films, for detection of hydrogen peroxide in milk, and for quantitative determination of nicotine. Most of these uses have been discontinued, 
although some dyes that may contain benzidin e as an impurity are still used as stains for 
microscopy and similar laboratory applications (ATSDR, 2001). 
(b) Benzidine-based dyes 
Benzidine-based dyes were used primarily to colour textiles, leather, and paper 
products and also in the petroleum, rubber, plastics, wood, soap, fur, and hair-dye  BENZIDINE 165  
 industries (NTP, 2005b). Approximately 40% w as used to colour paper, 25% to colour 
textiles, 15% to colour leather, and 20% for diverse applications. By the mid-1970s, most 
manufacturers started phasing-out the use of benzidine-based dyes and replacing them with other types of dyes (NIOSH, 1980). A ccess to these dyes for home use is no longer 
permitted in the US; however, some dyes (particularly direct browns, greens, and blacks) 
were available as consumer products in the 1970s (ATSDR, 2001). 
1.7.2  Dimethylbenzidine and dime thylbenzidine-based dyes 
(a) 3,3
′-Dimethylbenzidine 
3,3′-Dimethylbenzidine is a starting material in the production of a large number of 
azo dyes and pigments. 3,3 ′-Dimethylbenzidine is used in the determination of oxygen 
and chlorine in water, and for the colorimetric determination of cations of gold, cerium, 
and manganese. An important derivative of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine is its diacetoacetyl 
compound, 4,4’-bi sacetoacetylamino-3,3 ′-dimethyldiphenyl. It is a coupling agent that is 
frequently used; in combination with chloroanilines it gives yellow shades. 3,3 ′-
Dimethylbenzidine diisocyanate is used as a cross-linking agent for the synthesis of 
polymers (Schwenecke & Mayer, 2005). 
(b) Dimethylbenzidine-based dyes 
Dimethylbenzidine-based dyes and pigments have been used in printing textiles, as 
biological stains, and in colour photography (NTP, 2005b). 
1.7.3  Dichlorobenzidine 
3,3′-Dichlorobenzidine was introduced in the early 1930s and is an important 
diphenyl base. It is used as the starting mate rial for pigments with yellow and red shades. 
These are used for coloring pr inting inks, paints, plastics,  and rubbers. The important 
diarylide yellow pigments, which are incorrect ly known as benzidine yellows, are formed 
by the combination of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine with acetic acid arylides. 3,3 ′-
Dichlorobenzidine is also used in the production of polyurethane rubbers (Schwenecke & Mayer, 2005). 
Diarylide pigments are important economical ly, particularly in the production of 
printing ink. 3,3 ′-Dichlorobenzidine is by far the most important bisdiazo component. The 
term “benzidine pigments” is still sometimes u sed for this group, but this is incorrect 
because benzidine has never been used to pr oduce diarylide pigments . Diarylide pigments 
are produced by the bisdiazotization of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine, followed by coupling with 
two equivalents of an acetoacetic arylide (Herbst & Hunger, 2004). 166 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 1.7.4  Dimethoxybenzidine and dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes 
(a) Dimethoxybenzidine 
3,3′-Dimethoxybenzidine is used almost exclus ively as a chemical intermediate for 
producing dyes and pigments. The Society of Dyers and Colourists reported its use in the 
production of 89 dyes in 1971. 3,3 ′-Dimethoxybenzidine is also used as a chemical 
intermediate to produce ortho- dianisidine diisocyanate for use in adhesives and as a 
component of polyurethanes (IARC, 1974). 
(b) Dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes 
3,3′-Dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes and pigments  have been used as colourants for 
paper, plastics, rubber, textiles, and leather (IARC, 1974). 
1.8 Occurrence 
1.8.1  Natural occurrence 
Benzidine and its congeners are not known to occur naturally. 
1.8.2  Occupational exposure 
Occupational exposure to benzidine, benz idine congeners and their related dyes can 
occur during the production and use of th ese substances. Other workers potentially 
exposed to benzidine include laboratory personnel using benzidine-containing laboratory 
chemicals. Steinberg (1977) reported the results of a 197 4 survey of US forensic 
laboratories, which showed that 54 of 276 la boratories were familiar with the benzidine 
test for blood. 
Benzidine-based dyes and benzidine congener -based dyes can also be metabolized to 
benzidine and the respective congener, which may result in additional exposure to the 
aromatic amine. Exposure studies in benz idine-based dye worker s therefore measured 
benzidine rather than the benzidine-based dyes. 
Studies reporting airborne and urine levels and dermal wipes of benzidine in the 
benzidine and benzidine-based dye industry are listed in Tables 1.8–1.10. 
(a) Airborne benzidine 
Benzidine concentration in workplace air has been reported for different work 
settings;  the results are summarized in Table 1.8. 
In a Moscow aniline-dye factory, benzidine was produced from 1930 to 1988, with a 
six-year lapse from 1941 to 1947, after whic h the plant was reconstructed (Bulbulyan et al., 
1995). Factory area air-samples were obtained  between 1930 and 1971. Benzidine-in-air 
concentrations of up to 6 mg/m3 were reported. Levels were lower after the reconstruction   BENZIDINE 167

 of the plant and airborne benzidine levels were all below the limit of detection in 1971. 
In a chemical plant in the USA, benzidine production started in 1929 (Zavon et al. , 
1973). After an employee had noted haematuria in 1958, concentrations of benzidine in the air at different locations of the plan t were assessed. These measurements showed that 
major exposure occurred at an activated ch arcoal discard press during hand cleaning as 
well as during shovelling of dry benzidine into barrels (air concentration, 17.6 mg/m
3). 
In another US chemical plant in Connecticut, USA, benzidine was produced between 
the mid-1940s and mid-1965, while dichlorobenzidine production continued until 1989 
(Ouellet-Hellstrom & Rench, 1996). Due to bladder-cancer concerns a permanent biological monitoring programme was instituted in 1949, which continued until 1965. Air 
concentrations measured in 1948 and 1949 were reported (Meigs et al. , 1951, 1954) with 
a maximum of 0.087 mg/m
3. 
In a Polish benzidine-manufacturing plant (Krajewska et al. , 1980), air samples 
showed lower airborne benzidine concentrat ions after the production process had been 
changed. 
Direct dye-production facilities in three citi es in China (Tianjin, Shanghai, Jilin) used 
imported powdered benzidine until about 1956, when production of benzidine began in 
Tianjin and Jilin (Bi et al. , 1992). Benzidine production ceased  in 1977. In addition to the 
two benzidine-production facilities, in 1971 th ere were eight benzidine-using facilities in 
Tianjin and eight in Shanghai. Benzidine was measured in ambient air in the factories in 
Tianjin and Jilin during 1962–1970,  with a maximum of 1.18 mg/m3, during packaging. 
In the Republic of Korea (Kim et al. , 2007) benzidine exposure levels in 1998 were 
available from one benzidine-production facility and two facilities that used benzidine. In 
many samples benzidine was not detectable, and the highest concentration of 0.65 mg/m3 
was measured during filtering in the be nzidine-based dye manufacturing plant. 
(b) Biomonitoring of urinary concentrations 
Measurements of benzidine and benzidine de rivatives in the urine of workers in 
various factories are summarized in Table 1.9. 
In a benzidine production plant in the USA (Zavon et al. , 1973) and in a chemical 
plant in Connecticut, USA (Meigs et al. , 1954), urine concentrations were measured pre- 
and post-shift. In both studies, leves we re higher after the workshift than before. 
In direct dye-production facili ties in three cities of China (Bi et al. , 1992), urine levels 
were determined for selected workers in Tianjin, in 1962. Levels of renal benzidine excretion ranged between non-detectable and 0.77 mg/24 hours.  BENZIDINE 171

  BENZIDINE 173  
 As part of a US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) industry-
wide study, urine samples were collected from  workers exposed to azo dyes during the 
dye manufacture (two sites) and use (four sites) (Lowry et al. , 1980). Levels of benzidine 
and monoacetylbenzidine were reported fo r different departments (see Table 1.9). 
Diacetylbenzidine and 4-aminobiphenyl were no t detected in the urine of the workers. 
In a Polish benzidine-manufacturing plant, urinary levels were below the detection 
limit in 64% of the samples. The detected concentrations ranged between 0.004 and 
0.0123 mg/L (Krajewska et al. , 1980). 
In a study in the United Kingdom (Meal et al. , 1981), 200 samples from 29 workers 
exposed to benzidine-derived dyes in three textile-dye houses, two tanneries, and two 
dyestuff quality-control laboratories were an alysed. Of the 29 workers, five (from one  
woollen-textile industry) had detectable levels of free benzidine in their urine after acid 
hydrolysis, ranging between 1.0–25.4 nmol/mmol creatinine. 
Indian workers in a small-scale unit manuf acturing Direct Black 38 provided urine 
samples. Acetylated benzidine metabolites were  detected in all and benzidine in all but 
two samples (Dewan et al. , 1988). 
In Indian factories that manufactured benzidine dihydrochloride or benzidine-based 
dyes, levels of free urinary benzidine and acet yl-benzidine were measured in 33 workers. 
One subject had non-detectable levels of benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine and N,N′-
diacetylbenzidine in his post-shift urine sa mple. Mean levels of free benzidine and 
benzidine metabolites in the remaining 32 workers were reported (Rothman et al. , 1997). 
(c) Dermal exposure 
Three studies reported dermal exposure in workers by measuring levels of benzidine 
in dermal wipes. They are summarized in Table 1.10. 
1.8.3  Environmental occurrence and exposure of the general population 
Benzidine-based dyes can contain varying amounts of benzidine due to 
contamination. Twenty-six US -produced dyes based on benzid ine were found to contain 
< 1–20 mg/kg benzidine and one contained 270 mg/kg (IARC, 1982). Eight of 33 
benzidine-based dye samples obtained from Belgium, Egypt, India, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and the Republic of Korea were found to contain 38–1254 mg/kg of 
benzidine; the others had 24 mg/kg or less (IARC, 1982). 
The general population can be exposed to benzidine when in contact with consumer 
goods that contain benzidine or benzidine based-dyes, such as leather products (Ahlström 
et al. , 2005), clothes and toys (Garrigós et al. , 2002). Some food colours such as tartrazine 174 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 and sunset yellow FCF have been reported to contain trace amounts of benzidine (< 5 to

The general population can also be exposed to benzidine when living near former 
manufacturing or disposal sites where be nzidine and benzidine-based dyes were 
manufactured or disposed of. Benzidine and benzidine-based dyes have been detected 
in effluent from plants manufacturing and using dyes. In the effluent of a Brazilian 
textile-dye processing plant, benzidine w as detected at concentrations of 47 μg/L 
(Alves de Lima et al. , 2007). In 1990, benzidine was detected at 240 μg/L (on site) 
and 19 μg/L (off site) in groundwater at a hazardous-waste site that was the former 
location of a large dye manufacturer (ATSDR, 2001). Microbial degradation of these benzidine-based dyes may release free be nzidine into the environment (ATSDR, 
2001). 
1.9 Regulations and guidelines 
Table 1.11 gives an overview of the regulations and guidelines detailed below. 
1.9.1  Europe 
(a) Council Directives 89/677/EEC and 97/56/EC 
According to Council Direc tive 89/677/EEC, benzidine and its salts are restricted

(d) Directive 2004/37/EC 
Benzidine and its salts are regulated by the Directive 2004/37/EC (European 
Commission, 2004a). The directive applies to  activities in which workers are exposed 
to carcinogens or mutagens of category 1 and 2. Rules are fixed regarding the 
employers' obligations of reduction and replacement, prevention and reduction of 
exposure, unforeseen exposure, foreseeable exposure, access to risk areas, hygiene 
and individual protection, information for the competent authority, information and training of workers, consultation and partic ipation of workers, health surveillance, 
record keeping and limit values.  
(e) Cosmetics Directive (2004/93/EC) 
The Commission Directive 2004/93/EC of 21 September 2004 amends Council 
Directive 76/768/EEC for the purpose of adap ting Annexes II and III thereto to technical 
progress (European Commission, 2004b). In this  directive, the following substances are 
listed in Annex II  as substances that must not form part of the composition of cosmetic 
products: benzidine dihydrochloride; benzidine-based azo dyes; dimethylbenzidine 
(4,4′-bi-ortho -toluidine); dimethylbenz idine dihydrochloride; dimethylbenzidine-based 
dyes ( ortho -tolidine-based); di chlorobenzidine; dichlorobe nzidine dihydrochloride; 
dimethoxylbenzidine and its salts; and dimethoxylbenzidine-based azo dyes. 
(f) Directive 2005/90/EC 
In the Directive 2005/90/EC,  the list of substances classified as carcinogenic, 
mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (c/m/r) of Directive 76/769/EEC was amended to 
include benzidine (Europ ean Commission, 2005). 
1.9.2 Germany 
Benzidine and its salts are classified as Category-1 carci nogens by the MAK 
Commission. The MAK Commission listed benz idine and its salts as substances where 
percutaneous absorption may significan tly contribute to systemic exposure. 
3,3′-Dichlorobenzidine is classified as a Category-2 carcinogen by the MAK 
Commission. The MAK Commission listed 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine as a substance where 
percutaneous absorption may significan tly contribute to systemic exposure. 
3,3′-Dimethylbenzidine and 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine are classified as Category-2 
carcinogens by the MAK Comm ission. No MAK values were set for these substances 
(MAK, 2007). 178 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 1.9.3  Japan 
The Japan Society for Occupational Health  (2007) follows the classification by IARC 
of benzidine in Group 1; of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine, 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine, 
3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine, C.I. Acid Red 114, and C.I. Direct Blue 15 in Group 2B; and of 
C.I. Direct Black 38, C.I. Direct Blue 6, and C.I. Direct Brown 95 in Group 2A. 
1.9.4  USA 
(a) ACGIH 
Benzidine has been assign ed an A1 notation, Confirmed Human Carcinogen . No 
numerical TLV (threshold limit value) is recommended for occupational exposure for 
agents assigned an A1 notati on. A skin notation is recomm ended based on the skin being 
a significant route of entry into the body, leading to systemic toxicity. As for any substance with no recommended TLV and an A1 carcinogenicity notification, worker 
exposure should be carefully controlled to the fullest extent po ssible (ACGIH, 2001). 
3,3′-Dimethylbenzidine ( ortho -tolidine) and 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine and its 
dihydrochloride salt, have been assigned an A3 notation, Confirmed Animal Carcinogen 
with Unknown Relevance to Humans . No numerical TLVs are recommended for 
occupational exposure to these substances. A skin notation is recommended based on the 
skin being a significant route of entry into the body, leading to systemic toxicity (ACGIH, 
2001). 
(b) NIOSH 
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH, 2005) lists 
benzidine and 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine among 13 OSHA -regulated carcinogens. Exposures 
of workers to these chemicals should be controlled through the required use of engineering controls, work practices, and personal protective equipment, including 
respirators. OSHA and NIOSH concluded that  benzidine and benzidine-based dyes were 
potential occupational carcinogens and recommended that worker exposure be reduced to the lowest feasible level. OSHA and NIOSH further concluded that ortho -tolidine 
(3,3′-dimethylbenzidine) and ortho -dianisidine (3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine) and dyes based 
on these compounds may present a cancer risk  to workers and should be handled with 
caution. 
(c) NTP 
Benzidine and dyes that are metabolized  to benzidine are listed in the NTP Report on 
Carcinogens  (NTP, 2005a) as known human carcinogens . 
3,3′-Dimethylbenzidine and dyes th at are metabolized to 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine are 
listed in the NTP Report on Carcinogens  (NTP, 2005b) as reasonably anticipated to be 
human carcinogens .  BENZIDINE 179  
 3,3′-Dichlorobenzidine and 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine dihydrochloride are listed in the 
NTP Report on Carcinogens  (NTP, 2005c) as reasonably anticipated to be human 
carcinogens . 
3,3′-Dimethoxybenzidine and dyes th at are metabolized to 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine 
are listed in the NTP Report on Carcinogens  (NTP, 2005d) as reasonably anticipated to 
be human carcinogens .

 2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
2.1 Case reports 
Numerous case reports from different countr ies were reviewed and described in the 
IARC Monographs Volume 1, Volume 29 and Supplement 7 (IARC, 1972, 1982, 1987). 
Relevant studies are discussed below. 
Vigliani and Barsotti (1962) reported  47 tumours of the urinary bladder 
(31 carcinomas, 16 papillomas) that occurred between 1931 and 1960 in six Italian 
dyestuff factories among workers involved in benzidine production and utilization 
[number of workers at risk not available] . Twenty of the 47 cases occurred between 1931 
and 1948 among 83 Italian dyestuff workers. Airborne concentrations of benzidine 
measured in one of the plan ts ranged from 0 to 2.0 μg/m3 (13 samples, mean = 0.3 μg/m3), 
and urinary concentrations ranged from 6 to 25 μg/L [the number of specimens analysed 
was not provided]. 
Zavon et al.  (1973) followed for 13 years a group of 25 men occupationally exposed 
to benzidine during its manufacture in a plant in Cincinnati (USA). All of the workers were exposed to benzidine, three of the workers were also exposed to 2-naphthylamine 
for about one year, and three to α-toluidine. Airborne benzidine concentrations at various 
locations within the plant varied from < 0.005 to a maximum of 17.6 mg/m
3 at a location 
where the workers shovelled benzidine into  drums; the approximate mean urinary 
concentration reached 0.04 mg/L by the en d of the workshift. Thirteen men (52%) 
developed transitional cell bladder carcinoma af ter a mean exposure of  13.6 years and an 
average latency (time from first exposure) of 16 .6 years. The mean du ration of exposure 
for those who did not develop tumours was 8.9 years. Four renal tumours were observed 
in three men. [The Working Group of Volume 29 considered that the high incidence of bladder cancer in this cohort was remarkable  evidence of the carcinogenic potency of 
benzidine]. 
Since the publication of Supplement 7 (IARC, 1987), four case reports have 
documented the presence of bladder cancer cases among workers exposed to benzidine 
(Matsushima, 1989; Mason et al.  1992; Szeszenia-Dabrowska et al.  1997; Miyakawa 
et al.  2001). Based on thei r observations, Miyakawa et al.  (2001) suggested that the 
latency period of occupational bladder cancer after exposure to benzidine could be longer 
than 40 years. 
2.2 Cohort studies (see Table 2.1)  
Case et al.  (1954) studied workers from 21 dyest uff factories in England and Wales. 
Bladder cancer occurred approximately 15–20 years after exposure to different aromatic 
amines, including benzidine on ly, aniline, 1-naphthylamine only, 2-naphthylamine only, 
magenta, auramine and mixed exposures. They found a total of 127 deaths for which the   BENZIDINE 181

 death certificate indicated bladder cancer  (4.09 expected). For workers exposed 
exclusively to benzidine, 10 confirmed bladder-cancer deaths were found (0.72  expected). 
The authors also reported a total of 34 incident bladder-cancer cases among workers exposed to benzidine only. 
In a study of 639 white men exposed to benzidine and/or 2-naphthylamine in a plant 
in Ohio (USA), Mancuso & el-Attar (1967) reported 14 bladder-cancer deaths and a total of 18 genitourinary cancer deat hs. The mortality rate for blad der cancer in the cohort was 
78/100 000 versus 4.4/100 000 expected on th e basis of Ohio male mortality rates. The 
cumulative risk for incident bladder cancer in workers exposed to benzidine was reported to be 237 per 100 000. The authors also noted six cases of pancreatic cancer, with a 
cumulative mortality rate of 39 per 100 000 ( vs 7.5/100 000 expected). 
Among 1601 workers in the chemical-dye industry in China who were exposed to 
benzidine, methylnaphthylamine  and dianisidine, An & Deng (1980) reported 21 cases of 
bladder cancer. All cases had a history of exposu re to benzidine, and no cancer was found 
among workers exposed to methylnaphthylamine or dianisidine. An exposure-response relationship was suggested, as the percentage of cases among exposed workers increased 
with length of exposure (test for trend P < 0.01). 
Morinaga et al.  (1982) ascertained the incidence of second primary cancers in 
3322 workers employed from 1950 to 1978 in industries in Japan that manufactured 
benzidine and 2-naphthylamine. Of the 244 workers who had developed cancer of the 
genitourinary organs, 11 men subsequently developed histologically confirmed cancers of the liver, gallbladder, bile duct, large in testine, and lung. An unexposed group of 
177 male bladder-cancer patients, assembled from the Osaka Cancer Registry during 
1965–1975, showed eight cases of a second primary cancer, five being stomach cancer. No stomach cancer was observed in the study co hort. A statistically significant excess risk 
for liver, gallbladder, and bile-duct cancer ( P < 0.05) was found. The number of observed 
deaths from respiratory cancer was greater than  expected, but not stat istically significant. 
In 1982, Rubino et al.  reported the results of a retrospective cohort study in dye-
manufacturing workers of Turin, Italy. A ve ry high bladder-cancer risk was observed 
among workers exposed to benzidine (five deaths observed, SMR = 83.3). An extended follow-up conducted by Decarli et al.  (1985) reported 41 deaths (SMR 46.1; 95% CI, 
33.9–62.6) for the total cohort. Piolatto et al.  (1991) added eight years of follow-up. The 
cohort included 664 male wo rkers employed more than on e year from 1922 to 1970. 
Occupational history was obtained from plant r ecords and included cat egories of exposure 
to selected chemicals including benzidine. Th e overall bladder-cancer mortality risk was 
very high (49 deaths, SMR 30.4; 95% CI, 23.0–40.2). The risk for bladder cancer was also found to vary inversely both with age at first exposure and time since last exposure. 
The authors reported elevated SMRs for u pper digestive and resp iratory tract cancers. 
Meigs et al.  (1986) reported a statistically sign ificant excess of bladder tumours in a 
cohort of 984 workers at a benzidine-manuf acturing facility in Connecticut. Benzidine-
exposure status was determined from information contained in employment, production  BENZIDINE 191  
 and sales records. Eight cases of bladder cancer  were observed (SIR  3.4; 95% CI, 1.5–
6.8). Risk was greatest among those in the highest exposure category (SIR 13.0; 95% CI, 
4.8–28.4). Risk also showed an increasing tr end with length of employment: < 1 year, 
SIR = 0 (1.15 expected; 95% CI, 0–3.2); 1–5 years, SIR = 3.4 (95% CI, 0.4–12.4); and 
> 5 years, SIR 10.0 (95% CI, 0.6–21.7). The authors report a decline in the overall 
bladder-cancer incidence among those employed after 1950, coincident with the implementation of major preventi ve exposure measures, but in dicate that this finding is 
limited by the small number of cases. 
Wu (1988) reported the results of studie s conducted by The Cooperative Group in 
China. One of these stud ies was a retrospective cohort st udy of 2525 workers exposed to 
benzidine for at least one year from 1972 through 1981 [the author reports that the 
production and use of benzidine in China was stopped in 1977]. Twelve deaths and 30 incident bladder-cancer cases were observe d. An excess incidence of bladder cancer 
compared with the Shanghai general population was observed (SIR 26.1; 95% CI, 18.8–
35.4). A synergistic effect of smoking on benzidine-associated bladder-cancer risk was 
also observed. When compared with non-smoki ng and non-exposed workers, the relative 
risk for bladder cancer of smoking non-exposed workers was 6.2, compared with a risk of 
63.4 for non-smoking exposed workers, and a risk of 152.3 for smoki ng exposed workers. 
In addition to the principal findings related to bladder cancer, a slight increase in the 
incidence of lung and stomach cancers was noted  in workers exposed to benzidine. [The 
Working Group noted that quantitative data were not provided.] 
A cohort of workers employed at a Ne w Jersey (USA) dye and resin manufacturing 
plant was examined from 1952 to 1985 as pa rt of a larger retrospective study of 
2642 workers (Delzell et al.  1989). Occupational history was obtained from plant records, 
and department titles were classified into 10 work areas. The azo -dye area involved 
exposures to dye-related compounds including benzidine. Eighty-nine of the workers had 
former employment at the Cincinnati Chemical Works (CWW), which had produced or used benzidine and 2-naphthylamine. The 2553 workers who had never worked at the 
CWW, and therefore had little potential for benzidine exposure, had fewer than expected 
deaths from all causes combined and from diseases of all major organ systems. The former CWW workers had an excess of cancer , which was due to excess mortality from 
bladder (SMR 12, P = 0.004), kidney (SMR 9.5, P = 0.04), and central nervous system 
(SMR 9.1, P = 0.04) cancers. Sathiakumar and Delz ell (2000) added 10 years of follow-
up by extending the cohort through 1995. The expanded cohort included 3266 workers 
(2859 men, 407 women) employed more than 6 months. The bladder-cancer mortality 
excess observed in the earlier study among former CWW workers remained in the 
expanded cohort. The overall SMR for bladder cancer among all white men employed in 
the North Dyes area (where benzidine was used  from 1959 to 1970) was 5.2 (95% CI, 
1.4–13.2). The au thors attributed the bladder-cance r excess to exposure to aromatic 
amines at the CWW, since plant employees that had not worked at the CWW had 
approximately equal observed and expected deaths from bladder cancer. 192 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 You et al.  (1990) conducted a retrospective cohort study in seven factories producing 
benzidine-based dyes in Shanghai, China. The cohort included 736 production workers 
(550 men, 186 women) employed for more than six months. Occupational history was obtained from plant records and included accumulated working time in benzidine 
production. Men were classified based on th eir jobs into two groups: pre-synthesis 
(thought to have been exposed to benzidine) and post-synthesis (exposed mainly to finished benzidine-based dyes) . Five deaths and 14 cases of bladder cancer in men were 
observed, all in the pre-synthesis group. In creased mortality and incidence were observed 
in the whole cohort and in the pre-synthesis group, particularly among those workers involved in material treatment (SIR 75.0, P < 0.01) and synthetic reaction (SIR 26.9, 
P < 0.05). 
Szeszenia-Dabrowska et al.  (1991) studied a cohort of 6978 men employed in rubber 
goods production, predominantly rubber footwear, in Poland. The cohort included 
workers employed for more than three months from 1945 to 1973. Occupational history 
was obtained from plant records. The authors indicated that aromatic amines, including 
benzidine, are among the chemicals used as additives in rubber factories. The type and 
level of chemical exposure were indirectly estimated. Ten deaths from bladder cancer 
were observed in the whole cohort (8.4 exp ected), and six were among workers employed 
in production. Among the subcohort employed  during 1945 and 1953, and presumably 
exposed to aromatic amines including benz idine, the SMR for bladder cancer was 2.8 
(95% CI, 1.2–6.1). Seven deaths from lymphopoietic cancers were observed (14.2 were expected). 
Shinka et al.  (1991) observed that 105 of 874 Japanese workers of nine dye-
manufacturing plants who were engaged in the manufacture and handling of benzidine developed urothelial (primarily bladder) cancer. In a more recent study, Shinka et al.  
(1995) extended the follow-up of 363 exposed workers. Occupational history was 
obtained from plant records and workers were  classified into exposure categories with 
regard to benzidine or 2-naphthylamine. Workers were also classified according to their 
work in benzidine manufacture, benzidine use, or both. The risk factors significantly 
related to tumour occurrence in all nine pl ants were benzidine as a dye intermediate (OR 
8.3; 95% CI, 1.6–42.6) and manufacturing work (OR 4.6; 95% CI, 1.9–11.0). 
In a cohort of 1972 benzidine-exposed workers in China between 1972 and 1977, Bi 
et al.  (1992) examined bladder-cancer mortalit y and incidence through 1981. Limited 
industrial hygiene data on benzidine were ava ilable, and were used in combination with 
knowledge of operations to classify the job held  for the longest time as being associated 
with a high, medium or low exposure to benzidine. The authors reported an overall SMR of 17.5 (eight deaths; 95% CI, 7.5–34.5) a nd an overall SIR of 25 (30 cases, 95% CI, 
16.9–35.7), with risks ranging from 4.8 (95% CI, 1.0–14.1) to 158.4 (95% CI, 67.6–
309.0) for low to high exposu res. Further, bladder cancer was positively associated with 
exposure duration. Benzidine-exposed worker s who also smoked cigarettes had a 31-fold 
increased risk for bladder cancer, compared with an 11-fold increased risk observed in  BENZIDINE 193  
 non-smoking workers. Hayes et al.  (1993) conducted a nested-case contro l study in 38 
bladder cancer cases and 43 controls from th is cohort. Using the exposure categories 
developed by Bi et al. , and assigning them a score of 1 for low, 3 for medium and 9 for 
high, the authors estimated cu mulative benzidine exposure as the product of each score 
times duration of exposure. Cumulative benzidine level-years were categorized into low 
(< 30), medium (30–59) and high ( ≥ 60) exposure. Compared with low exposure, the 
risks for medium and high exposure were OR 2.6 (95% CI, 0.8–8.9) and OR 6.7 (95% CI, 
1.7–33.6), respectively. Carreón et al.  (2006) expanded the previous study to include 68 
cases and 107 controls frequency-matched by 10-year age grou ps. Using the same 
cumulative benzidine-exposure categories, the risks for medium and high exposure, 
compared with low, were OR 2.7 (95% CI, 1.1–6.3) and OR 4.4 (95% CI, 1.8–10.8). 
These risks were adjusted for lifetime ci garette smoking. Additionally, Carreón et al.  
(2006) reported that NAT2  genotype slow acetylators had a reduced risk for bladder 
cancer when compared with rapid acetylators (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–1.0). The study did 
not have sufficient power to evaluate the interaction between NAT2  polymorphisms and 
benzidine exposure. To overcome this limitation, the authors compared the result 
presented above with the result of a meta-ana lysis of eight case–control studies of NAT2 
acetylation and bladder cancer in Asian pop ulations not exposed occupationally to 
aromatic amines. The authors concluded that  there was evidence of a gene-environment 
interaction, as the upper limit of the estimat e obtained in their study adjoined the lower 
limit obtained in the meta-analysis (pooled OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0–2.0). 
Bulbulyan et al.  (1995) evaluated a cohort of 4581  aniline dye-production workers for 
cancer incidence and mortality. The study in cluded limited indust rial hygiene air and 
environmental measurements of benzidine and 2-naphthylamine dating back to the 1930s; jobs were classified into groups based on exposure to benzidine and 2-naphthylamine. In 
a group of 514 men and 287 women who had been ever exposed to benzidine or 
2-naphthylamine, there were 115 observed cases of all cancers vs 62.57 expected cases. 
Among men ever exposed to benzidine or 2-naphthylamine, increased incidence was 
observed for cancers of the oesophagus (SIR 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4–8.4), lung (SIR 2.3; 95% 
CI, 1.5–3.4), and bladder (SIR 10.8; 95% CI, 6.9–17.0). Women had a statistically significant excess of bladder cancer (21.0;  95% CI, 8.7–50.4).  Excess cancer rates, 
including  for bladder cancer, were also foun d in men and women exposed only to “other” 
chemicals. The risk for bladde r cancer did not increase with duration of employment for 
workers ever-exposed to benzidine, bu t it did for workers ever-exposed to 
2-naphthylamine. 
Naito et al.  (1995) conducted a retrospective cohort mortality study of 442 workers 
(437 men, five women) exposed to one or more substances (mainly benzidine, 
2-naphthylamine, 1-naphthylamine, and ortho -dianisidine) at a benzidine-production and 
dye-manufacturing plant in Japan. No industrial hygiene data for the plant were available; 
therefore, duration of employme nt at the facility was used as a surrogate of duration of 
exposure. The authors reported  that all the workers wore work clothes, gloves, high 194 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 rubber boots, and a gas mask in the factory, and that it had wide windows in all directions. 
A significantly increased risk for bladder cancer was found among workers engaged in 
the manufacture (SMR 63.6; 95% CI, 30.5–117.0) and use (SMR 27.0; 95% CI, 8.8–63.0) of benzidine. Increased risks for cancer mort ality for other organs  were observed, but 
these were not statistically significant. [No information was provided for lymphohaemato-
poietic cancers.] Incidence ra te-ratios of urothelial cancer  increased with duration of 
exposure for both benzid ine manufacture and use. 
Szymczak et al.  (1995) and Sitarek et al.  (1995) carried out a mortality study among 
10 529 workers in a dye-manufacturing plant in Poland, involving exposure to benzidine. Workers were classified into four groups b ased on their potential to  benzidine exposure. 
A statistically significant increase in morta lity from bladder cancer was observed among 
men exposed to benzidine only (SMR 14.7; 95% CI, 7.6–28.2) and benzidine and other occupational hazards (SMR 16 .3; 95% CI, 9.9–27.1) . Increased mortality risks were also 
observed among men exposed to benzidine and other occupational hazards for pancreatic 
cancer (SMR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2–8.7). No  excess mortality for lymphohaematopoietic 
cancers was observed among men exposed to benzidine alone or in combination with 
other occupati onal hazards. 
Rosenman and Reilly (2004) analysed a cohort of 488 white men employed in a 
chemical manufacturing facility in Michigan, USA. The facility had produced benzidine 
from 1960 through 1972 and 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine from 1961 to 2001. Workers were 
identified from social security records. Sin ce no plant records were available, social 
security data were used to estimate time of first work and years worked. Analyses were 
conducted for the entire coho rt and separately for people who began to work in 1973 or 
later, after benzidine production had been di scontinued. For the wh ole cohort, an excess 
of bladder-cancer mortality was observed (SMR 8.3; 96% CI, 1.7–24.4). All cases 
occurred in those with five or more years of duration of work. There were six deaths from 
lymphohaematopoietic cancer (SMR 2.8; 95 % CI, 1.04–6.2) including one from non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, one from multiple myeloma, two from chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia, one from acute leukaemia, and on e from chronic myelogenous leukaemia 
(SMR for leukaemia 5.1; 95% CI, 1.4–12.9). The SIR for bladder cancer was 6.9 (95% CI, 4.3–10.4); no additional  cases of lymphohematopoietic cancer were identified from 
the cancer registry. All bladder-cancer deat hs and 21 of 22 cases of bladder cancer 
occurred among those employed before 1973.  A statistically significant increase in 
mortality from lymphohematopoietic cancer was observed among workers who began 
work in 1973 or later. 
2.3 Case-control studies (see Table 2.2)  
Since the publication of Supplement 7,  a few case–control studies of benzidine 
exposure and the risk for bladder and othe r cancers have been published. These studies 
have a high potential for misclassi fication of exposure, as inform ation is collected on past   BENZIDINE 195

 events that may be inaccurately recorded or not available, and information obtained from 
study participants may be biased. In addition,  the level of exposure in these studies is 
likely to be, on average, much lower than that  in the cohort studies, which tend to focus 
on workers with the highest  exposures to benzidine. 
In a population-based case– control study in Utah (USA), Schumacher et al.  (1989) 
examined the associations betw een bladder cancer and occupational exposures, including 
benzidine. The authors incl uded 417 bladder-cancer cases diagnosed between 1977 and 
1983, identified from a rapid ascertainme nt system and the state cancer-registry. 
Population-based controls were randomly sel ected and frequency-matched to cases by age 
and sex in a 2:1 ratio. The number of controls was 877 (685 men, 192 women). Trained 
interviewers conducted home interviews to obtain complete occupational histories and 
information on bladder-cancer risk factors. An occupation-exposure linkage system was used to identify work ers exposed to suspect bladder car cinogens, including benzidine and 
2-naphthylamine. The system graded expo sures as “light,” “moderate,” “heavy” and 
“unknown”. Those with heavy e xposures were classified as exposed, and the rest were 
considered unexposed. The numbers of workers exposed to benzidine and 
2-naphthylamine were identical, since the same occupations were linked to both 
chemicals. Among men, an increased risk fo r bladder cancer was observed among those 
exposed to benzidine, even though the association did not reach statistical significance 
(OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7–2.1). A non-statisti cally significant risk increase was observed 
among men with more than 10 years of exposure (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.6–4.1). No increased risk for bladder cancer was observed among women ever-exposed to benzidine. 
Smoking did not conf ound these associations. 
You et al.  (1990) selected 317 men with bladde r cancer from Shanghai, China, 41 of 
whom were considered to have been occupationally exposed to benzidine if employed for 
more than six months in the dyestuffs, rubbe r, cable, ink, dress pressing or cigarette 
industries. The study included 317 hospita l-based non-cancer controls, matched by 
hospital, gender, and age within five years. Controls were from the same industrial and 
residential districts as the cases. Occupational exposure to benzidine was associated with 
bladder cancer incidence (OR, 5.7; P < 0.001). 
A series of case–control studies for differe nt cancers and occupations have been 
conducted in Canada. All of the studies in volved the selection of 19 types of cancer 
(20 755 cases) from eight provin cial cancer registries. The cancer registries ascertained 
cases on the basis of pathology reports. Ca ncer-free population-ba sed controls (5039) 
were selected from a random sample of in dividuals within the provinces. Sampling 
strategies for controls varied among provinces. Controls were frequency-matched to all cancer cases by age and sex distribution. A standardized questi onnaire including 
occupation and cancer risk factors was maile d to study participan ts. The questionnaire 
also recorded information on exposure to 17 di fferent chemicals, incl uding benzidine, for 
at least a year, and the duration of that ex posure. Telephone interviews were conducted 
with those subjects who failed to return th e questionnaire. [These studies have large 198 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 sample sizes, are population-based, and cont rol for the known risk factors in each 
analysis, but have the known limitations of  case–control studies,  including the low 
reliability of self-reported exposures and exposure misclassification]. 
In the most recent analysis of  the Canadian series, Ugnat et al.  (2004) studied 
549 men with histologically-confirmed bladder cancer and 1099 male controls. They 
observed an increased risk for bladder cancer  among people who reported exposure to 
benzidine (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.0–4.9). The exposure-response relationship was 
not statistically significant ( p for trend = 0.26). 
Mao et al.  (2000) studied 1469 newly diag nosed cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
and 5073 population-based co ntrols. The author s found increased risks for non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma among men exposed to benzidine (adjusted OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.4). 
Among men, an exposure-response effect was observed with increased length of exposure to benzidine ( p for trend = 0.02). 
Hu et al.  (2002) analysed the risk for re nal cell cancer among 1279 cases and 
5370 population-based controls . An increased risk for renal cell carcinoma was observed 
among men (adjusted OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–3.6) but not among women (adjusted OR, 
1.0; 95% CI, 0.3–3.1). An increased risk wi th duration of exposure to benzidine was 
observed among men ( p for trend = 0.004). 
3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
Animal bioassays conducted with benzidine were reviewed in IARC Monograph 
Volumes 1 and 29, and in Supplement 7. The studies mentioned in Volume 1 were all 
reconsidered in Volume 29. This Section pr ovides a summary of these studies and a more 
detailed review of more recent ones. 
3.1 Benzidine 
3.1.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse 
Four groups of 50 male B6C3F 1 mice, six weeks of age, were fed 150 ppm benzidine 
dihydrochloride (certified Amer ican Chemical Society (ACS ) grade) in the diet for 
45 weeks. Groups of 50 mice were killed at 45, 60, 75 and 90 weeks of age, respectively, 
to evaluate the occurrence of liver-cell tu mours. At 45 weeks, 8/50 (16%) mice had 
tumours, 4% of which were hepatocellular carcinomas. At 60, 75 and 90 weeks the proportions of mice with tumours were 20/50 (40%), 31/50 (62%) and 35/50 (70%). Of 
these tumours, 10%, 28% and 48 %, respectively, were hepatocellular carcinomas. In  BENZIDINE 199  
 historical controls, the incidence of hepato cellular tumours was 1/98 (1%) (Vesselinovitch 
et al.,  1975). [No statistical analysis was applied.] 
Three groups of 50 male B6C3F 1 mice, six weeks of age, were fed 150 ppm 
benzidine dihydrochloride (certified ACS grade) in the diet until 45, 60, or 90 weeks of 
age. All animals were killed at 90 weeks of  age. The incidences of mice bearing liver 
tumours, mostly hepatocellular carcinomas, are given in Table 3.1. A negative relationship was observed between the incidence of liver tumours and the duration of 
treatment, which may have been related to toxicity (Vesselinovitch et al.,  1975). [No 
statistical analysis was applied.]

From Vesselinovitch et al.  (1975) 
To evaluate the effect of mode of admini stration in benzidine-induced carcinogenesis, 
groups of 50 male and 50 fe male B6C3F1 mice were given doses of 50 or 100 ppm 
benzidine dihydrochloride (certified ACS grade)  in the feed, or twi ce weekly by stomach 
tube, at 0.5 or 1.0 mg/treatment. No effects on  survival were noted, and all animals were 
killed at 90 weeks of age. Continuous feeding of benzidine in the diet produced liver-cell 
tumours in 3/50 (6%) males and in 13/50 (26%) females at the lower dose, and in 11/50 
(22%) males and 32/50 (64%) females at th e higher dose, which indicates a greater 
susceptibility of female animals. One liver tumour was seen in 98 male control mice, 
none in 100 control females. Twice-weekly administration of benzidine by stomach tube 
seemed to have a weaker hepatocarcinogeni c effect than continuous feeding at 
comparable amounts, especially in female mice: 4/75 (5%) had tumours after intermittent feeding vs 13/50 (26%) upon continuous feeding of 50 ppm [no statistical analysis was 
applied]. Benzidine also caused Harderian gland tumours and lung adenomas in both 
treatments, and had a marginal effect on the development of lymphoreticular tumours (Vesselinovitch et al. , 1975). 
Groups of 43–100 B6C3F
1 male and female mice [age not specified] were fed a diet 
containing 150 ppm benzidine dihydrochloride [purity unspecified] (1) from the 12th day of gestation (prenatal) to delivery; (2) to mothers with litters from delivery to weaning; 
(3) to offspring from weaning to 90 weeks of age; (4) during the pre-natal and pre-
weaning period; or (5) prenatally, during pre-weaning and in adulthood. Groups of 200 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 untreated controls were also available. Admi nistration pre-natally or during pre-weaning 
induced a marked increase in the incidence of  hepatocellular tumours in male mice (31 
and 95%, respectively) but not in females (3  and 5%, respectively). In mice treated from 
weaning to 90 weeks of age,  the tumour incidences were 59% in males and 96% in 
females. In the group treated both pre-nata lly and during pre-weaning, the incidences 
were 100% in males and 25% in females. When  mice were treated pre-natally, during pre-
weaning and then up to 90 weeks of age, the incidences of hepatocellular tumours were 
100% in males and 94% in females [no statis tical analysis applied]. The incidences of 
hepatocellular tumours in untreated contro ls were 1% in males and 0% in females 
(Vesselinovitch et al.,  1979). 
Groups of F 1 (C57BL/6Jf C3Hf/Nctr females × BALB/cStCrLfC3Hf/Nctr males) and 
mono-hybrid (F 1 females and F 1 males) weanling mice were fed diets containing 0, 30, 
60, 120, 200 or 400 ppm of benzidine hydrochloride [purity unspecified]. The 400-ppm 
dose was chosen on the basis of preliminary tests, the highest dose being probably the 
maximum tolerated dose. Groups of mice were killed after 40, 60 or 80 weeks of treatment. The incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in the control and 
treated groups, summarized in Table 3.2,  were increased in treated mice (Nelson et al.,  
1982). 
In studies designed to assess the susceptibility of mice to liver tumours at different 
stages of development, groups of B6C3F
1 mice were fed diets containing 150 ppm of 
benzidine dihydrochloride [purity not specified]. Pregnant female mice were fed from the 12th day of gestation to delivery (group 1), to mothers with litters from delivery to 
weaning (group 2) and to offspring from weaning through 90 weeks (group 3). Ninety-
eight to 100 B6C3F
1 male and female mice were killed at 52, 90 and 142 weeks and 
served as controls. The incidences of he patocellular adenomas and carcinomas are 
summarized in Table 3.3. The incidences of carcinomas were increased in the pre-
weaning and adult mice (Vesseli novitch, 1983). [No statisti cal analysis was applied.] 
Groups of 72–120 F 1 (BALB/cStCr1fC3Hf/Nctr males × C57BL/6Jf C3Hf/Nctr 
females) and mono-hybrid cross (MC) (F 1 males and F 1 females) mice, 4–5 weeks of age, 
weighing 8–15 g were given drinking-water containing 0, 30, 40, 60, 80, 120 or 160 ppm (for males) and 0, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80 or 120 ppm (for females) of benzidine dihydro-
chloride [purity unspecified] and killed after 33 months of exposure. Dose levels were 
selected using data from a prior study (Frith & Dooley, 1976). The incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas, along with data on body weights, water consumption, the dose 
received by animals, the overall mortality, ad justed liver-tumour mortality and the time to 
liver tumour were reported (Littlefield et al. , 1984). Effects on body weight and survival 
were noted in both strains. The incidences of  malignant liver tumours are summarized in 
Table 3.4. For all four strain/sex combinatio ns, there was a significant dose-related trend 
for fatal liver tumours, incidental liver tumours, and the pooled estimate using Peto's test [details on statistics not provided]. At the lo west doses, the incidence in Harderian gland   BENZIDINE 201

a r/n = number of animals with tum our / number of animals examined 
tumours was also increased compared with th at in the controls (4 and 5% in the F 1 
females and males, and 5 and 8% in the MC males and females, respectively), and then 
remained higher at the other dose levels in th e males. The incidences in the high  doses for 
F1 and MC males were 25 and 20%, respectively (dose effect, P = 0.02 with a linear and 
quadratic term). The females of both strains r eached a high incidence of 24 to 29% in the 
mid-doses, which then decreased to about  11 or 12% at the high dose ( P = 0.002 with a 
linear and quadratic effect). A dose effect w as also observed for angioma of the uterus

the F 1 and MC strains of mice, respectively; then it increased with dose to 14% for F 1 
mice and 7% for MC mice (Littlefield et al. , 1983, 1984). 202 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

(b) Rat 
Two groups, each of 10 female Wistar rats [age not specified] were fed a diet 
containing 0.017% be nzidine [purity not specified] w ith casein or a diet containing 
benzidine with casein hydrolysat e-tryptophan. All rats given benzid ine plus casein were 
dead by 224 days after the start of treatment; 2/10 (20%) had liver tumours (1 hepatoma 
seen at 125 days and 1 bile-duct carcinoma  at 178 days). Animals fed benzidine-
tryptophan survived longer (424 days): 3/7 (43%) animals examined had hepatocellular tumours (1 carcinoma at 202 days, 1 cholangioma at 236 days and a bile-duct carcinoma 
at 424 days). None of the animals in the two experimental groups developed bladder 
tumours (Boyland et al. , 1954). [The Working Group noted the small number of animals 
and the lack of controls.] 
Four groups of 10–20 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 40 days of age, were given 
benzidine [purity was tested, but not described in detail] at doses of 12, 25, 35 or 50 mg/rat in sesame oil by stomach tube fo r 30 days. A control gr oup was fed the sesame-
oil vehicle. At the end of the nine-month period of observation, when the experiment was 
terminated, 10/10 (100%), 8/10 (80%), 0/20 and 4/20 (20%) animals were still alive in the four treatment groups, respectively. In the ve hicle control group, 127/140 (91%) were still 
alive at nine months. Thus, mortality was high in animals fed the two highest doses of  BENZIDINE 203

benzidine, and only five rats  (at the highest dose) were autopsied; four of these showed 
multiple mammary carcinomas. In the groups receiving 12 and 25 mg benzidine/rat, 5/10 (50%) and 7/9 (78%) animals autopsied also  showed multiple mammary carcinomas (one 
rat in the group fed 12 mg had a fibroadenoma). Five of 132 sesame-oil vehicle controls 
examined had mammary tumours. In the benzidine-treated groups, the first palpable mammary lesions appeared about 60 days after the first treatment. At this point the mean 
number of mammary masses per rat showed a dose–response relations hip [no statistical 
analysis applied]. No effect was reported in organs other than the mammary gland (Griswold et al. , 1968). 
(c) Hamster 
Groups of 30 male and 30 female random-b red Syrian golden hamsters, nine weeks 
of age, were fed diets containing 0.1% (w/w) benzidine or benzidine dihydrochloride 
(certified grade) for life. A control group of  the same size was also available. No bladder 
pathology was seen in either th e treated or the control grou p. In the benzidine-treated 
group, an increased inci dence of liver tumours was observed: 19/22 (86%) males and 6/26 
(23%) females developed multiple cholangiomat ous tumours, most of which had signs of 
malignancy; 12 males and three females also developed benign and malignant hepatocellular tumours. In the group fed benzidine dihydrochloride, the liver was also the 
only target organ: 10/20 (50%) male and 12/27 (44%) female hamsters developed 
cholangiomas, mostly benign; seven males an d four females also developed hepatomas. 
No liver tumours were seen in females or ma les of the untreated control group (Saffiotti et 
al., 1967). 204 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 (d) Other animal species 
(i) Rabbit 
An invasive bladder carcinoma was induced in one out of nine rabbits [sex, age and 
strain not specified] given oral tolerance limit doses of benzidine [purity not specified] (Bonser, 1962). [The Working Group noted the lack of description of experiment or 
results.] 
(ii) Dog 
Seven mongrel dogs (one male and six fema les, full grown; ~11.3 kg) were given a 
total dose of 325 g benzidine [purity not speci fied] by oral capsules over 5 years (200 mg 
per day for 15 months and then 300 mg per day for 45 months, on six days a week). One of the female dogs developed bladder carcinomas (Spitz et al. , 1950). [The Working 
Group noted the lack of description of experiment or results.] 
(iii) Frog  
A group of five frogs ( Rana temporaria ), 1–1.5 years of age, received a total oral 
dose of 60 mg benzidine [purity not specified] and were observed for 20 weeks, after 
which the experiment was terminated. One liv er tumour was observed (Khudoley, 1977). 
[The Working Group noted the lack of de scription of experiment or results.] 
3.1.2  Subcutaneous and/or intramuscular administration 
(a) Mouse 
Three groups of 12–24 male, albino Delph mice, 10 weeks of age, were given 
subcutaneous injections of 300 mg benzidin e base [purity unspecified ] in olive oil, or 
received olive oil alone, thr ee times a week for 45 weeks. One group served as untreated 
controls. The survival rates we re good in all groups up to 45 weeks when the experiment 
was terminated. No changes in the bladde r were observed in the benzidine-treated 
animals. In 2/19 (10%) control mice receiving olive oil alone hyperp lasia of the bladder 
was noted. Five of nine (55%) mice given be nzidine base had hepatomas, compared with 
3/19 (16%) in the olive oil group and 5/17 (29%) in the untreated controls (Baker, 1950). 
[The Working Group noted the short duration of the experiment.] 
A group of 54 male and 13 female C3HA mi ce [age at start not specified], weighing 
18–20 g, were injected subcutaneously with 6 mg/mouse of benzidine [source and purity 
not specified] dissolved in 0.2 mL of sunflower oil once per week over eight months (total dose, 210 mg/mouse). At the appearance of the first tumour (16 months), 46 mice [sex not 
specified] were still alive. Liver tumour s (hepatocellular carcinomas, adenomas and 
cholangiomas) developed in 13 mice [sex not specified]; and lung adenocarcinomas were found in two mice. A further group of 1 14 males were exposed by the same treatment 
schedule for 13 months (total dose, 336 mg/mouse). At 16 months, 24 mice were still  BENZIDINE 205  
 alive, and 18 developed liver tumours. Hepatomas developed in 1% of historical controls 
(Prokof'eva, 1971). [The Working Group noted the low survival rates.] 
(b) Rat 
Groups of Sherman rats, two months of age, average weight 150 g, were given 15 mg 
of benzidine [technical and purified grades] or benzidine sulfate [technical grade] by 
subcutaneous injection, once weekly for life. A suitable control group was given the olive oil vehicle. The experimental design and data on survival and tumour incidence are 
summarized in Table 3.5 (Spitz et al. , 1950). [The Working Group noted the poor 
survival in both treat ed and control groups.]

toxicity, a smaller dose of 10 mg per week w as then given for the next six weeks to each 
rat, and finally once every 15 days for six week s. By six months of treatment, each animal 
had received a total dose of 300 mg benzidine. Another group of 50 ra ts [sex unspecified] 
served as controls: 25 received subcutaneous in jections with the solvent for six months 
while the remaining 25 rats were kept untreated. Of the 15 treated males surviving, 12 developed tumours: two hepatomas, four malignant tumours of the Zymbal gland, six 
sarcomas at the injection site and two other sarcomas; two of the five surviving treated 
females developed tumours: one malignant tumour of the Zymbal gland and one myeloid 206 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 leukaemia. None of the 25 contro ls injected with the solvent [sex not specified] developed 
tumours at the injection site (Pliss, 1964). 
A group of 28 rats [strain and sex not specified], 6–8 weeks of age, were given 
benzidine [purity, source and vehicle not specified] by weekly subcutaneous injections of 
5 mg/rat for 32–60 weeks (total dose, 170 mg /rat). When the first tumour appeared at 
210 days, 28 rats were still alive. Intestinal tumours developed in four rats between 252 and 318 days (Pliss et al. , 1973) [The Working Group noted the lack of available controls 
and the lack of experimental detail.] 
Groups of 16 female and 14 male white non-bred rats [strain and age not specified] 
were injected subcutaneously with benzidine [source and purity not specified] (5 mg/rat) 
dissolved in 0.5 mL of sunflower oil, weekly for about 52 weeks (total dose, 160–
260 mg/rat). At 219 days, when the first tumour (a skin epithelioma) was detected, 24 rats [sex not specified] were still alive; all animals were killed at 357 days. Tumours were 
found in 23 rats (95.8%), with an average latent period of 275 days. Nine of 24 rats 
(39.1%) had multiple primary tumours. Zymb al gland tumours developed in 18 rats 
(78.3%); five had local fibrosarcomas an d one a local rhabdomyosarcoma (Pliss and 
Iogannsen, 1974). [The Working Group noted that no untreated or solvent controls were 
available.] 
Groups of 18 male and 16 female albino non-inbred rats [age at start not specified] 
weighing 120–140 g were injected subcutaneo usly once a week for about 33 weeks with 
benzidine (5 mg/rat; source and purity not specified) suspended in 0.5 mL of oil [not specified] to give a total dose of 170 mg/rat. At 210 days, when the first tumour appeared, 
16 males and 12 females were still alive. A total of 26 tumours developed in 14 males: six 
local sarcomas, nine tumours of the Zymb al gland, nine liver tumours (cysto-
cholangiomas and hepatocellular carcinomas) a nd two intestinal tumours (polyposis and 
adenocarcinoma). A total of 20 tumours develope d in 11 females: five local sarcomas, six 
tumours of the Zymbal gland, four mammar y adenocarcinomas, one mammary adenoma, 
two liver tumours (cystocholangioma and hepatocellular carcinoma) and two intestinal 
tumours (Pliss & Vol'fson, 1974). [The Working Group noted that no untreated or solvent 
controls were available.] 
(c) Frog 
A group of 37 grass frogs ( Rana temporaria ) of both sexes, 1–1.5 years of age, 
received weekly subcutaneous injections of 0. 2–0.5 mL of a 0.5% so lution of benzidine 
[purity not specified] in mineral oil for up to 38 weeks (total dose, 45–114 mg/animal). A 
group of 120 untreated frogs were observed for 56 weeks (t hree of these developed skin 
cystadenopapillomas), and a further group of 67 frogs were given subcutaneous injections of 0.2–0.5 mL mineral oil, weekly for 42 weeks as controls. When the first tumour 
appeared at 16 weeks, 14 animals in the treat ed group were still alive, of which six (43%) 
had tumours of the liver and haematopoietic system [not further specified], with an  BENZIDINE 207  
 average latent period of 24.8 weeks. No tumours were observed in the control group 
(Khudoley, 1977). 
3.1.3  Intraperitoneal administration 
(a) Rat 
Three groups of 30 female CD rats, 30 days of age, were given intraperitoneal 
injections twice weekly for 4 weeks, of 0, 10 or 30 μmol/kg bw benzidine [purity not 
specified] as a suspension in tr ioctanoin. Control rats r eceived trioctanoin only. All 
survivors were killed 46 week s after the first injection. No tumours were seen in the 
kidney or bladder in treated or control groups. In the benzidine-treated groups, a dose-related increase in the incidence of mammary tumours, benign and malignant, was noted: 
3/30 (10%) in controls, 7/30 (23%) in the low-dose group and 12/29 (41%) ( P < 0.01, χ
2 
test) in the high-dose group. Zymbal gland tumours (adenomas or carcinomas) were observed in 1/30 (3%) controls, 1/30 (3%) low-dose animals and 7/29 (24%) ( P < 0.05) 
high-dose animals. No tumours of the liver we re found; however, altered cellular foci in 
the liver were observed in 9/30 (19%) controls, 14/30 (46%) low-dose animals and 20/29 (76%) ( P < 0.01) high-dose rats (Morton et al.,  1981). 
3.1.4  Inhalation exposure 
(a) Rat 
A group of 48 white out-bred rats of both sexes [age at start non specified], weighing 
100–120 g, were exposed to an aerosol containing 10–20 mg/m
3 [1.3–2.7 ppm] benzidine 
[source and purity not specified] in inhalation chambers during four hours/day, for five days a week over 20 months (total dose, 27 mg/rat). Control rats [number not specified] 
were kept in inhalation chambers and expos ed to air during the same period. Animals 
were kept until moribund. The first myeloge nous leukaemia was found in a treated rat 13 
months after the start of the experiment, at which time 28 rats were still alive. By the end 
of the study (28 months), five myeloid leukaemias, two breast fibroadenomas, one 
squamous-cell cancer of the Zymbal gland, one hepatoma and one breast adenocarcinoma 
were found in eight animals. Mammary aden omas were found in two of 21 control rats 
(Zabezhinski ĭ, 1970). [The Working Group noted the lack of information on the size of 
the aerosol particles and on the survival of controls.] 
3.1.5  Other experimental systems 
(a) Mouse 
Following surgical implantation of a 45-mg  glass bead in the urinary bladder of 
female mice (strain 150 ICR) at five weeks of  age, the animals were divided into three 
groups: one group (30 mice) served as controls  and was fed a commercial basal diet; the 208 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 second group (60 mice) received a diet contai ning 0.2% benzidine [purity not specified]; 
the third group (60 mice) was fed a diet containing a mixture of 0.2% benzidine and 2% 
DL-tryptophan. The experimental  groups received their diets starting at six weeks of age 
for 20 weeks and were then fed the control diet for 40–43 weeks. The experiment was 
terminated 63 weeks after the start of trea tment. Of the group th at received benzidine 
alone, only 19% of the animals were still a live at the end of the experiment, while 65.5% 
of controls and 49.2% of the group treated with benzidine plus tryptophan were still alive 
at that time. Hepatomas were observed in 34 of 41 (82.9%) mice treated with benzidine 
and in 24 of 51 (47.1%) mice treated with the benzidine-tryptophan mixture, indicating an inhibitory effect of tryptophan; no hepatomas were seen in the controls. No bladder 
tumour was found in any of the animals; howev er, the authors reported  hyperplasia in all 
bladders observed (Miyakawa and Yoshida, 1980). 
(b) Rat 
Five groups of 30–40 male Fischer rats (age at start not specified), weighing 
approximately 200 g, were implanted with a heterotopic bladder, which was then instilled once a week for 20 weeks with 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline:dimethyl sulfoxide 
solution (PBS/DMSO, 4:1) or this solution containing 1 μmol benzidine or the 
derivatives, N
′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine, the N′-glucuronide of N′-hydroxy- N-acetyl-
benzidine, or the N-glucuronide of N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene [chemicals were 
synthesized and analysed by authors]. These bl adders were then instilled once a week for 
an additional 30 weeks with PBS without DM SO. The experiment was terminated at the 
end of 50 weeks. Transition al cell carcinomas were observed in 1 of 39 (3%) of the 
control group, 1 of 29 (3%) in the benzidine group, 18 of 30 (60%) in the N′-hydroxy- N-
acetylbenzidine group, 28  of 28 (100%) in the N′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine- N′-
glucuronide group, and in 24 of 29 (83%) of the N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene- N′-
glucuronide rats (Wang et al. , 1990). 
(c) Fish 
Benzidine [purity not specified] was mixed into a diet and given to a group of 
100 fish (guppies) of both sexes, 10–12 months of age, at a dose of 300 mg/kg dry diet for 
56 weeks, at which point the experiment was terminated. The six fish  that survived the 
treatment period had no detectable tumours; however, signs of hepatotoxicity (focal 
necrosis, fatty dystrophy and diffuse hyperplasia of hepatocytes) were noted. None of the 
120 control guppies fed the standard diet developed tumours or preneoplastic changes (Pliss & Khudoley, 1975). [The Working Grou p noted the high mortality in the treated 
group.]  BENZIDINE 209  
 3.2 3,3 ′-Dichlorobenzidine and its dihydrochloride 
Studies in experimental animals of carcinogenicity of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine and its 
dihydrochloride by oral exposure were previously reviewed by IARC (1982, 1987). Those found to be adequate and/or reported more fully in later publications are included 
in this evaluation. 
3.2.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse 
A group of 26 male ICR/JCL mice [age at start not specified] were fed a diet 
containing 0.1% 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine [purity unspecified, not clear if it was the free 
amine or the dihydrochloride salt] for up to 12 months. All eight animals killed after 
six months of treatment (100%) had hepatomas, as did all 18 animals (100%) killed after 
12 months of treatment. Of 39 control mice main tained on a normal diet and killed at six, 
12 and 18 months, 0/5 (0%), 2/21 (9%) and 5/13 (38%) had hepatomas respectively 
(Osanai, 1976). [The Working Group noted the absence of information on survival of 
treated and control animals.] 
A group of 22 female and 51 male D mice (cC
57W x C 57Bl hybrids, age not specified) 
weighing 12–20 g, received food containing  0.1 ml of a 1.1% suspension of 3,3 ′-dichloro-
benzidine (45.3% 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine, 50% water and 4.7% unspecified impurities) in 
sunflower oil, which was administered on six days a week for 12 months (total dose, 127–
135 mg/mouse). The animals were observed for life. There was no control group but the 
authors used historical control data. The numbe rs of mice that survived were: 37 at six 
months, 34 at 12 months, and 18 mice at the time of appearance of the first tumour 
(18.5 months). Four of 18 animals (22%) had tumours: 2/18 (11%) had hepatomas, 2/18 
(11%) had liver hemangiomas, 1/18 (5%) had a carcinoma of the sebaceous gland, and 
1/18 (5%) had a lung adenoma. No liver hepatomas or hemangiomas had been seen in the 
historical controls (Pliss, 1959). [The Working Group noted the absence of adequate 
controls]. 
(b) Rat 
A group of 15 female and 35 male outbred Rappolovo rats weighing 110–130 g [age 
at start not specified] received food containi ng 0.5–1.0 ml of a 4.4% suspension of 
3,3′-dichlorobenzidine (45.3% 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine, 50% water and 4.7% unspecified 
impurities) in sunflower oil at a dose of 10–20 mg/day, which was administered on six 
days a week for 12 months (total dose, 4.5 g/rat). The animals were observed for life. The numbers of animals that survived were: 34 at  six months and 27 at 12 months. At the time 
of the appearance of the first tumour (11 months), 29 rats were alive. Twenty-three rats 
(23/29, 79%) developed tumours, including seven (24%) Zymbal gland tumours, three (10%) skin tumours, seven (24%) mammary gland tumours, two (7 %) adenocarcinomas 210 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 of the ileum, three (10%) bladder tumours, three (10%) tumours of the haematopoietic 
system, two (7%) connective tissue tumours, two (7%) salivary gland tumours, one (3%) 
liver tumour and one (3%) thyroid tumour. Among a group of 130 controls injected with octadecylamine and methylstearylamine, no tumours were found within 23 months (Pliss, 
1959). [The Working Group noted the absence of adequate controls.] 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female ChR-CD rats, 38 days of age, were given a diet 
containing 1000 ppm 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine [purity unspecified] for 16 months. An equal 
number of animals were maintained on a control diet for a period of 24 months. Six rats 
per group and per sex were killed at 12 months for an interim evaluation. Of the remaining treated rats, six survived up to 16 months, at which time they were killed. A 
statistically significant ( P < 0.05) increase in the incide nce of tumours was observed in 
treated compared with control animals for the fo llowing target sites in males: granulocytic 
leukaemias, 9/44 (20%) treated, 2/44 (4%)  control; mammary adenocarcinomas, 7/44 
(16%) treated, 0/44 control; Zymbal gland carci nomas, 8/44 (18%) tr eated, 0/44 control. 
In females, mammary adenocarcinomas were seen in 26/44 (59%) treated, 3/44 (7%) 
control (Stula et al. , 1975). 
A group of 20 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 40 days of age, were given 10 doses of 
3,3′-dichlorobenzidine dihydrochlo ride [purity and impurities unspecified] in sesame oil 
every three days by gastric intubation (total dose, 300 mg/rat, which was the maximum 
tolerated dose). The observation period was nine months, when the 14 surviving animals 
were killed. No mammary tumours were observed in 15 treated rats autopsied, while 5/132 (4%) animals treated with sesame o il only had mammary tumours (Griswold et al.,  
1968). 
(c) Hamster 
Groups of 30 male and 30 female random bred  Syrian golden hamsters, nine weeks of 
age, were given 0.1% of a technical grade 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine (mixture of 40% as the 
dihydrochloride and 60% as free base) in powd ered diet throughout th eir life-span (total 
intake, 3.0 g per animal per year). A similar group of 30 male and 30 female Syrian 
golden hamsters were fed the powdered diet only throughout their lifetime and served as 
the control group. No informati on on survival of th e treated or control animals was given. 
Exposure to this dose level of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine did no t induce any significant 
carcinogenic effect at any site or bladder pathology (Saffiotti et al. , 1967). [The Working 
Group noted the lack of description of experimental procedures and detailed pathological findings.] 
(d) Dog 
Six female beagle dogs, one year of age, were each given 100 mg 
3,3′-dichlorobenzidine (reported to be 100% pur e) in a gelatin capsule three times per 
week for six weeks, then five times per week continuously for periods up to 7.1 years. Six 
untreated female beagle dogs served as controls for several studies and were killed after  BENZIDINE 211  
 8.3 to 9.0 years on test. The intake of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine was between 9.1 and 
12.8 mg/kg bw per dose. One dog sacrificed after 3.5 years on test had no tumours. 
Another sacrificed after 6.6 years on test (t otal intake, 164 g) had an undifferentiated 
carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Of the remaining dogs killed at 7.1 years (total intake, 
176 g/dog), 4/4 (100%) had papillary transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder 
and 3/4 (75%) had hepatocellular carcinomas. None of the six control dogs had these tumours. However, 4/6 (67%) control animals killed at 8–9 years of age had major 
tumours of the mammary gland (adenocarcinomas and carcinosarcoma) (Stula et al. , 
1978). 
3.2.2  Subcutaneous and/or intramuscular administration 
(a) Mouse 
A group of 15 female and 8 male D mice (cC
57W x C 57Bl hybrids, age not specified), 
weighing 12–20 g, received twice weekly 0.1-ml subcutaneous injections of an 11% or a 
5.5% suspension of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine paste (45.3% 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine, 50% 
water and 4.7% unspecified impurities) in glycerol at a total dose of 265 mg/mouse over 11 months. The numbers of mice that survived were: nine at six months, eight at 12 
months, and eight at the time of appearance of the first tumour (12.5 months). The 
animals were observed for life. Five animals [sex not identified] (62%) had tumours at different sites: 2/8 (25%) had local sarcomas, 3/8 (37%) had liver tumours, 1/8 (12%) had 
a tumour of the haematopoietic system, 1/8 (12%) had a lung adenoma. Another group of 
31 female and 36 male D mice received weekly 0.1-ml subcutaneous in jections of an 11% 
or a 5.5% suspension of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine paste (45.3% 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine, 50% 
water and 4.7% unspecified impurities) in glycerol at a dose of 5 to 2.5 mg/mouse. The 
total dose was 130 mg/mouse over 11 months. The numbers of mice that survived were: 32 at six months, 23 at 12 months, and 20 at the time of appearance of the first tumour 
(13.5 months). The animals were observed fo r life. Eight animals [sex not identified] 
(40%) had tumours at different sites: 1/20 (5%) had local sarcomas, 5/20 (25%) had liver tumours, 1/20 (5%) had a tumour of the haematopoietic system, 2/20 (10%) had a lung 
adenoma, and 1/20 (5%) had a squamous-cell keratinizing tumour of the lower jaw. No 
tumour occurred within 23 months in 130 controls injected with octadecylamine or methylstearylamine (Pliss, 1959). [The Wo rking Group noted the absence of adequate 
controls and poor description of the patholog y findings.] 
(b) Rat 
A group of 61 sexually mature white rats weighing 110–130 g (strain, age, and 
distribution by sex not specif ied) initially received twice w eekly subcutaneous injections 
of a suspension of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine paste (45.3% 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine, 50% water 
and 4.7% unspecified impurities) in glycerol at a dose of 60 mg/rat. Because of initial 
high mortality, the dose was reduced beginning from the 6
th month to weekly injections of 212 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 20 mg/rat. The total dose of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine was estimat ed to range from 1.6 to 
3 g/rat. The animals were observed for life. A group of 130 rats (strain, age, and 
distribution by sex not given) served as controls and received subcutaneous injections of octadecylamine or methylstearylamine over a 10-month period and were then observed 
for life. Thirty-five animals su rvived to the time of appearance of the first tumour (time 
not specified). Eighteen animals (51%) had tumours: 9/35 (26%) had Zymbal gland tumours, 7/35 (20%) had mammary tumours, 5/35 (14%) had local sarcomas, 1/35 (3%) 
had liver tumours, 2/35 (6%) had a tumour of the haematopoietic system, and 1/35 (3%) 
had a thyroid tumour. No tumour occurred within 23 months in 130 controls injected with octadecylamine or methylstearylamine (Pliss, 1958). [The Working Group noted the 
inadequate reporting of the experiment.] 
A group of rats weighing 100–130 g (strain, age, number and distribution by sex not 
specified) received subcutaneous inj ections of 15–60 mg/rat of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine 
[purity and impurities unspecifi ed] in sunflower seed oil or glycerol and water at 
unspecified intervals for 10 to 13 months. No information on survival was provided. Tumours were reported to occur in 74% of animals. No information on number of 
tumour-bearing animals or time to first tumour was reported. Skin, sebaceous and 
mammary gland tumours were observed most fre quently, and there were also intestinal, 
urinary bladder and bone tumours. Among 50 control rats injected with the vehicle alone 
or left untreated, a single sarcoma was reported (Pliss, 1963). [The Working Group noted 
the inadequate reporting of the experiment.] 
3.2.3  Transplacental exposure 
(a) Mouse 
A group of BALB/c mice [number and age not specified] were treated with 
5 subcutaneous injections of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine in sunflower oil (2 mg/injection; total 
dose, 10 mg/mouse) during the last week of pregnancy. The progeny (13 males and 
11 females) were kept with the treated an imals throughout lactation and weaning at 3–
4 weeks, and were then observed until natural death. Of the offspring that lived 12–20 
months, 13/24 (54%) had tumours, compared with 6/30 (20%) of the control progeny. A 
significant increase in the incidence of lymphoid leukaem ias (7/24, 29%) in treated and 
0/30 in control animals [sex unspecified]) was observed in the offspring. Lung tumours 
(5/24 (21%) in treated and 3/30 (10%) in control animals) and mammary tumours 
(4/11 (36%) in treated and 3/19 (16%) in control animals) were also reported (Golub et al.,  1974).  BENZIDINE 213  
 3.2.4  Administration with known carcinogens 
(a) Rat 
Nine groups of 22 and one gr oup of 96 male Wistar rats (age not specified) received 
the following compounds alone or in sequence for a period of four weeks per compound: 
ortho -N-butyl- N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (0.01% in drinking water), N-[4-(5-nitro-2-
furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide (0.15% in the diet), N-fluorenyl-acetamide (0.025% in the 
diet) and 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine (0.3% in the diet). An untreated control group consisted 
of 12 rats. The animals were killed when 40 weeks old. 3,3 ′-Dichlorobenzidine given in 
sequence with one or more of the other com pounds induced histolog ical changes of the 
liver (cystic change of bile ducts and oval-cell proliferation) in 44–50% of animals 
(P < 0.05 when compared with gr oups that did not receive 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine). No 
change was seen in the liver when 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine was given alone. The incidence 
of urinary bladder tumours was not significantly increased when 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine 
was added to the sequence of th e chemicals studied (Tatematsu et al.,  1977). 
3.3 3,3 ′-Dimethoxybenzidine 
Studies in experimental animal s of carcinogenicity of 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine or its 
dihydrochloride salt by oral exposure were previously reviewed by IARC (1982). Those 
found to be adequate and/or reported more fully in later publications are included in this evaluation. 
3.3.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse 
Groups of 166 male and 165 female BALB/c mice, four weeks of age, were given 
drinking water containing 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, 315, or 630 ppm of 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine 
dihydrochloride [ purity unspecified] for up to 112 weeks. Inte rim sacrifices and 
histopathological assessments were conducted on  all dose groups after 13, 26, 39, 52, 78, 
or 112 weeks. Water consumption was monitored and was depressed in all the groups, 
especially the high-dose group.  Although body-wei ght gain was suppressed  at the highest 
dose level during the first year, administration of 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine 
dihydrochloride di d not affect the mortality of eith er males or females. No increased 
incidences of neoplasms were observed in an y of the tissues examined, which included 
spleen, Harderian gland, liver, and lung (Schieferstein et al. , 1990). 
(b) Rat 
A group of 42 male and female rats (strain, distribution and age not specified) were 
given 30 mg of 3,3 ′dimethoxybenzidine [purity unspecifie d] by gavage in sunflower-seed 
oil three times a week for three weeks. The do se was then reduced to  15 mg because of 214 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 poor survival and continued for an additional 13 months. Eighteen animals survived to 
14 months. Two of the 18 animals (11%) that survived to 18 months had neoplasms of the 
Zymbal gland, one (5.5%) had a fibroadenoma of the mammary gland, and one (5.5%) had an ovarian neoplasm. None of the 50 rats in the control groups (25 injected with 
sunflower-seed oil subcutaneously and 25 untreated) developed tumours at these sites 
(Pliss, 1963, 1965). [The Working Group noted the inadequate reporting of the 
experiment.] 
Groups of 3 or 14 (10-mg dose only) male and 3 or 15 (10-mg dose only) female 
Fischer rats (age not given) were administered 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine [purity 
unspecified] by gavage at dose levels of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg per animal per day 
on five days per week. A proprietary mixture composed of sodium chloride, sodium 
carboxymethylcellulose, polysor bate 80, and benzyl alcohol in water was used as a 
vehicle in this study. The an imals were treated for 52 week s and then observed for an 
additional six months. Groups of male and fe male rats received 0.5 ml of the vehicle 
five days per week and served as the vehicle controls. In addition,  there was a separate 
group of 90 males and 90 female rats that served as untreated controls. Neoplasms 
occurred as early as day 293, but most were detected at necropsy 18 months after the 
initial administration of 3,3 ′- dimethoxybenzidine. A variety of neoplasms were reported, 
and pooled results for all dosed male and fema le groups (59 animals) included neoplastic 
lesions of the urinary bladder (two papi llomas), mammary gland (three carcinomas, two 
fibroadenomas), skin (five carcinomas), intest inal tract (three carcinomas), and Zymbal 
gland (eight carcinomas). Incidences of neopl asms were significantl y increased over those 
of the 360 pooled vehicle and untreated control rats (Hadidian et al. , 1968). 
Groups of 60, 45, 75, and 60 male and fema le F344/N rats, seven weeks of age, were 
given drinking water containing 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine dihydrochloride at 0, 80, 170, 
or 330 ppm respectively (corresponding to 0, 6, 12, or 21 mg/kg per day for males and 0, 
7, 14, or 23 mg/kg per day for females) for up to 21 months. Although initially planned as a two-year study, this experiment was terminat ed early because of reduced survival in all 
dose groups associated with the appearance of  treatment-related neoplasms. Survival 
decreased markedly with increasing dose. Among males, the number of rats surviving at 
study termination was 44 in the control group and eight in the low-dose group. None of 
the male rats in the medium- and-high-dose groups survived the study duration. Among 
females, 45, 15, and 6 rats survived in the control, low-dose, and medium-dose groups, respectively, and none of the ra ts in the high-dose group su rvived. The tumour incidences 
in male and female rats are shown in Tabl es 3.6 and 3.7. Histopat hological examination 
of the tissues revealed tumours at various sites, including benign and malignant tumours of the skin, Zymbal gland, preputial gland, clitoral gland, mammary gland, uterus, oral 
cavity, intestine, liver, a nd mesothelium. The observed increase in the incidence of 
astrocytomas of the brain may also have  been related to exposure to 3,3 ′-
dimethoxybenzidine dihydrochloride (NTP, 1990).  BENZIDINE 215  
 (c) Hamster 
Groups of 30 male and 30 female, random bred Syrian golden hamsters, nine weeks 
of age, were given 0.1% 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine (purity not given) in powdered diet 
throughout their lifespan (3.0 g per animal per year). A similar group of 30 male and 30 female Syrian golden hamsters were fe d the powdered diet only throughout their 
lifetime and served as the control group. The only malignant neoplasm observed was a 
transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder in one animal after 144 weeks of 
exposure to dimethoxybenzidine. This neoplasm is rare in hamsters and therefore was 
attributed to dimethoxybenzidine exposure (Saffiotti et al.  1967). [The Working Group 
noted the lack of description of experime ntal procedures and detailed pathological 
findings.]

 3.4 3,3 ′-Dimethylbenzidine 
Studies in experimental animals of the carcinogenicity of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine or 
its dihydrochloride salt by exposure via oral and subcutaneous administration were previously reviewed by IARC (1982). Those fo und to be adequate and/or reported more 
fully in later publications are included in this evaluation. 
3.4.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse 
Groups of 120 male and 120 female BALB/c mice, four weeks of age, were given 
drinking-water containing 0, 5, 9, 18, 35, 70, or 140 ppm of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine 
dihydrochloride [ purity unspecified] for up to 112 weeks. Inte rim sacrifices and 
histopathological assessments were conducted on  all dose groups after 13, 26, 39, 52, 78, 
and 112 weeks. Water consumption was monitored, and average weekly 3,3 ′-dimethyl-
benzidine dihydrochloride doses (mg/kg) were determined to range from 5 to 126 mg/kg 
per week. 3,3 ′-Dimethylbenzidine dih ydrochloride in oral do ses exceeding 100 mg/kg per 
week was well tolerated, as evidenced by th e absence of treatment-related changes in 
water consumption, body-weight gain, or morta lity. Incidences of alveolar-cell adenomas 
and adenocarcinomas ( P < 0.0002, carcinomas; P < 0.0001, adenomas and carcinomas 
combined) of the lung were increased in a dose-related fashion among males that were 
either found dead or sacrificed in mori bund condition. Sim ilar increases were not 
observed in females or in animals randomly se lected for interim sacrif ice (Table 3.8). The 
incidences of tumours of the skin, spleen, live r, and Harderian gland were unaffected by 
the administration of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (Schieferstein et al.,  1989). 
(b) Rat 
A group of twenty female Sprague-Dawley rats, 40 days of age, were given a 
suspension of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine (purity not given)  in sesame oil by gavage at a tota1 
dose of 500 mg per rat, fractionated in 10 do ses at 3-day intervals and then held for an 
additional eight months. A group of 140 fema le Sprague-Dawley rats, 40 days of age, 
served as the controls and received the sesame oil only. Surv ival was 80% in treated 
animals versus 90% in the controls . Sixteen rats treated with 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine were 
alive at the end of the nine-month observat ion period. Neoplastic responses included 
significantly increased inciden ces of mammary tumours. Three of the 16 treated animals 
(19%) showed a total of four mammary carcinomas. Among 132 surviving control rats, 
five (4%) had a total of three mammar y carcinomas, one fibroadenoma and five 
hyperplasias (Griswold et al. , 1968). 
Groups of 70, 45, 75, and 70 male and fema le F344/N rats, 6 weeks of age, were 
given drinking-water containing 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride [purity 
unspecified] at 0, 30, 70, or 150 ppm, respec tively, for up to 14 months. Although initially 218 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

planned as a two-year study, this experime nt was terminated early because of reduced 
survival in all dose groups asso ciated with the appearance of treatment-related neoplasms. 
A scheduled interim sacrifice and histopath ological assessment of 10 controls and 
10 high-dose animals of each sex was condu cted during the ninth month of the study. 
Although the incidences of tumours observed in 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride-
dosed rats were not significantly elevated at this interim sacrifice, the appearance of 
malignant tumours of the liver (male only), lung, mammary gland (female only), skin, 
preputial gland (male only), oral cavity (femal e only), small intestine (male only), clitoral 
gland, and Zymbal gland after only nine months suggested a treatment-associated early onset of some tumours. Tumour incidences, su mmarized in Table 3.9, were unequivocally 
increased in a dose-related manner after 14 months of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine 
dihydrochloride administration. Administration of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine dihydro-
chloride significantly incre ased the incidences of a wide array of malignant and benign 
tumours in both sexes of F344/N rats. (NTP, 1991b).  BENZIDINE 219

(c) Hamster 
Groups of 30 male and 30 female random bred  Syrian golden hamsters, nine weeks of 
age, were given 0.1% 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine (purity not given) in powdered diet 
throughout their life-span (3.0 g per animal per year). A similar group of 30 male and 
30 female Syrian golden hamsters were fe d the powdered diet only throughout their 
lifetime and served as the control group. Exposure to this dose level of 3,3 ′-dimethyl-
benzidine did not induce any significant carcinogenic effect or bladder pathology 
(Saffiotti et al. , 1967). [The Working Gr oup noted the lack of d escription of experimental 
procedures and detailed pathological findings.] 
3.4.2  Subcutaneous administration 
(a) Rat 
A group of 105 male and female (distributio n not given) Sherman rats, two months of 
age, were given a mixture of technical grade ortho -tolidine (3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine) in 
olive oil by subcutaneous injection for thei r lifetime. The weekly dose level was 60 mg 
per rat (maximum cumulated dose, 5.5 g). Of the treated animals, 48 (46%) survived 
more than 300 days. Five rats (4.8%) deve loped cancer of the external auditory canal 
(Zymbal gland), with all tumours appearing af ter the 354th day. Twenty-eight of the 50 
control rats treated with olive oil only (56%) survived more than 300 days. No details on 
any tumours observed in this control group were reported. While an untreated control 
group was not run concurrently in this experiment, the authors reported 56 tumours  BENZIDINE 221  
 occurring among 578 untreated rats (490 rats not otherwise incorporat ed in the study and 
88 animals in “diet and vehicle control grou ps”) of the same colony. None of these 
tumours were located in the ex ternal auditory canal (Spitz et al. , 1950). [The Working 
Group noted that this study is limited by po or survival of the an imals, which can be 
attributed to the reported lack of climate control in the animal rooms and widespread 
disease in the treated and control animals]. 
Groups of 27 male and 26 female random-bred white rats [strain and age not 
specified] received weekly subcutaneous inje ctions of a 4% suspension of purified ortho -
tolidine (3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine) in 0.5 ml sunflower oil for 13 months. Doses were 
20 mg per rat per week, for a total dose of 1160 mg/rat. Use of control animals was not 
reported. Twenty-five male and 25 female rats survived for at least eight months (time of 
occurrence of the first tumour), and 11 males and 5 females lived up to 18 months. Of the 
animals that survived  for at least eight months, 17/25 (68%) males and 13/25 (52%) 
females developed a total of 41 tumours.  Zymbal gland tumours accounted for 14/27 
(52%) tumours observed in males and 6/14 (43%) in females. Other sites where tumours were observed included mammary gland (five, female only), skin (three, male and 
female), preputial gland (three, male and female), and forestomach (one male). An 
additional group of rats (24 of each sex) r eceived a weekly subcutaneous implant of a 
pellet containing 20 mg of purified ortho -tolidine and 10 mg of glycerol for 14 months. A 
third group (20 of each sex)  received a weekly subcutaneous implant of a pellet 
containing 20 mg of ortho -tolidine that had been subjected to ultraviolet irradiation before 
the preparation of the pellet. The difference in response to these exposures between the 
two groups was minimal. Of a total of 68 animals that were alive at the time of 
appearance of the first tumour (11–12 months), 48 developed a total of 60 tumours. Among these were 27 Zymbal gland carcinomas, and tumours at other sites (Pliss & 
Zabezhinsky, 1970). [The Working Group noted this study was limited by the lack of a 
control group. However, in a pr eliminary report on these stud ies it was stated that rats 
from the same colony did not spontaneously de velop tumours of the Zymbal gland (Pliss, 
1965)]. 
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distributio n, metabolism and excretion 
4.1.1  Absorption 
(a) Humans 
Benzidine is light and fluffy, but solid and vapour forms can be rapidly absorbed 
through the skin (Barsotti and Vigliani, 1952; Budavari et al. , 1989; Ferber et al. , 1976; 
Meigs et al. , 1951, 1954; Zavon et al. , 1973). Exposure to benzidine can occur from 222 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 breathing contaminated air, wearing cont aminated clothing, or by ingestion of 
contaminated food or water (Meigs et al. , 1951). Breathing or ingesting benzidine-based 
dyes also expose humans to be nzidine, because the intestine contains bacteria that can 
break down these dyes into benz idine (Chung, 1983; Chung et al. , 1992). 
Absorption follows after exposure by inhalation, or by the oral and dermal routes. 
Inhalation and skin contact are probably th e predominant exposure routes for humans 
(ATSDR, 2001). It has been re ported that benzidine and 3,3′-dimethylbenzidine can 
readily penetrate intact skin (Meigs et al. , 1951). Industrial workers who handle benzidine 
and perspire freely were reported to have higher urinary concentrations of benzidine (Meigs et al. , 1954). 
(b) Animals 
Radioactivity was observed in  tissues, urine, and faeces following application of 1 
mg/kg bw of radioactive benzidine or benzidine derivatives for 1, 8, and 24 hours onto the 
shaved skin of F344 rats in  a well controlled study, in wh ich the animals were prevented 
from grooming themselves and licking at the site of benzidine application (Shah & Guthrie, 1983). About 25% of the initial dose of benzidine and benzidine derivatives 
penetrated into rat skin within 8 hours. At 24 hours after dosing, 49% of the radioactivity 
was recovered from the skin, which indicated that approximately half of the applied benzidine had penetrated into the skin and about 50% of the applied dose had been 
absorbed. 
Aldrich et al.  (1986) applied radiolabelled Direct Black 38 to the shaved dorsal skin 
of male F344 rats and New Zealand rabbits that were prevented from licking the site of 
application. Radioactivity was measure d in urine and faeces 24–144 hours after 
application of the dye. At 144 hours, approx imately 3% of the applied radioactivity was 
detected in the urine and 5%  in the faeces of the rabbits . Excretion of radioactive 
substances was eventually neglig ible in rats (0.05% in urin e and 0.16% in faeces). So skin 
penetration by the benzidine-based dye w as unlikely; the absorbed and excreted 
radioactive material in the rabbits was presu med to represent benzidine that had been 
liberated by azo reduction of  the dye (ATSDR, 2001). Bos et al.  (1986) demonstrated 
transport of benzidine but not benzidine-b ased dyes across the mucosa of an isolated 
segment of rat intestine in a perfusion chamber, suggesting that benzidine but not 
benzidine-based dyes could be absorbed in the intestine. 
Qiao et al.  (1996) and Williams et al.  (1996) developed a unique approach to study 
the absorption of chemicals from complex mi xtures by use of “mechanistically defined 
chemical mixtures (MDCM)” applied to pig skin, which is similar in structure and 
function to human skin. Baynes et al.  (1996) employed this sy stem to investigate the 
absorption of mixtures of chem icals consisting of a marker  chemical (benzidine), a 
solvent (acetone or DMSO), a surfactant (0% or  10% sodium lauryl su lfate), a vasodilator 
(0 µg or 180 µg methyl nicotinate), and a reducing agent (0% or 2% SnCl
2). It was found 
that acetone and DMSO enhanced dermal pe netration of benzidine in most of the  BENZIDINE 223  
 mixtures. Compared with other mixtures evaluated, SnCl 2 inhibited benzidine absorption 
irrespective of the solvent present. SnCl 2 also inhibited benzidine penetration in DMSO 
mixtures containing sodium la uryl sulfate only, but not in acetone mixtures. It was 
proposed that interactions between benzidine and SnCl 2 may be the cause of the inhibition 
of benzidine absorption. The chemical-biological interaction between methyl nicotinate, 
sodium lauryl sulfate, and the skin may enhance benzidine absorption. 
4.1.2  Distribution 
(a) Humans 
There is no information available on th e distribution of benzidine in humans. 
(b) Animals 
In general, there appears to be a rapi d plasma clearance of absorbed benzidine, 
followed by a more gradual metabolism and cl earance of its metabolites (Shah & Guthrie, 
1983; Lakshmi et al. , 1990). 
When rabbits were given oral doses of 60–120 mg/kg of benzidine for periods 
ranging from 42 days to 128 days, the highest concentrations were found in the heart and lungs. Benzidine metabolites were not determined (Oida 1958a,b). 
Soloimskaia (1968) reported that benzidine was rapidly absorbed after injection into 
rats with maximum concentrations of free and bound benzidines found at 2 and 3 hours, respectively. The highest concentrations were  found in the blood, followed by liver, 
kidney, spleen, heart, and lung. 
The body distribution of benzidine in various tissues and in urine of rats at 4 and 12 
hours after intraperitoneal (i.p .) injection of 100 mg/kg be nzidine was as follows: high 
concentrations were found in the stomach, stomach contents, and small intestine at 4 
hours, and in the small intestine and its conten ts at 12 hours. Tissue concentrations of 
conjugated metabolites were high at 12 hous , and benzidine concentrations in the liver 
were high and constant over the 12-hour period (Baker and Deighton, 1953). 
When radiolabelled benzidine was applied to the skin of rats, radioactivity was 
distributed approximately as follows (percentage of applied radioactivity at 1, 8, and 24 
hours after application): blood (0.2, 0.3, and 0.7%), liver (1.5, 1.0, and 0.7%), lung (0.09, 
0.2, and 0.2%), intestines (1.0, 14.0, and 1.3%), and stomach (0.5, 0.4, and 0.08%). Twenty-four h after dosing approximately half of the applied radioactivity had remained 
at the site of application (Shah & Guthrie, 1983 ). In a similar experiment in rats, in which 
radiolabelled benzidine was injected in travenously, tissues retaining the most 
radioactivities after three days were muscle, liver, and the stomach. Only a small amount 
was found in the bladder (Lynn et al. , 1984). 
Chipman & Mohn (1989) demonstrated that biliary benzidine and benzidine 
metabolites could be reabsorbed from the inte stine and transported again to the liver in 
both rats and mice. This entero-hepatic re-cir culation could contribute to the persistence, 224 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 the further metabolism, and presumably the he patoxicity and carcinoge nicity of benzidine 
and its metabolites. 
Sanderson & Clark (1993) showed that intraperitoneal administration of benzidine to 
pregnant mice resulted in the induction of micronuclei in the maternal bone marrow and 
in the liver of the fetuses;  however, when pregnant mice were orally exposed to 
benzidine, there was no increase in micronucleated  cells either in the maternal livers or 
the livers of the fetuses (Harper et al. , 1989). There was no information on whether 
benzidine could be stored in maternal tissues and be mobilized during pregnancy or 
lactation, nor was it known whether benzidine could be excreted in breast milk (ATSDR, 
2001). 
Kellner et al.  (1973) studied the distribution of benzidine by injecting 0.2 mg/kg of 
uniformly labelled [14C]-benzidine into animals of vari ous species. In rats, substantial 
radio-activity was found after 4 hours in the lung, small and large intestines, the bladder, 
and the kidney, with smaller amounts in all other tissues and fluids examined. The 
findings in dogs were generally similar except for the 10- to 15-fold higher levels of radioactivity in bladder tissue, and the much lower activity (about 10% that of rats) in the 
lung. This was consistent with the high carcinogenicity of benzidine in the bladder of 
dogs. Approximately 90% of the radioactivity was cleared from the blood during the first 
24 hours after dosing, the remainder being cleared more slowly. Half-lives of 
radioactivity from day one to day six or seven were 68 hours in the rats and 88 hours in 
the dogs. After seven days, the radioactivity was much reduced in all organs examined from rats, dogs, and monkeys. Highest residual act ivity was found in the liver for all three 
species. Expressed as concentration of benz idine in wet tissue,  the mean liver 
concentrations were 0.042 µg/g for rats, 0.087–0.19 µg/g for three dogs, and 0.01 and 0.027 µg/g for the two monkeys (ATSDR, 2001). 
In dogs, plasma clearance of benzidine is fa irly rapid. Approximatelty 10% remained 
in the plasma after 5 hours, while metabolism and metabolite clearance occurred more gradually. In a study of four dogs monitored over a 5-hour period following intravenous 
administration of 1 mg/kg radiolabelled benzidine, Lakshmi et al.  (1990) found that the 
initial plasma half-life of benzidine was ap proximately 30 minutes, while it was about 3 
hours for total radiolabel (benzidine and metabolites). Five hours after infusion, 75% of 
recovered radioactivity was found in the b ile (12–25%), urine (2 3–52%), and carcass 
muscle (15–30%). Significant amounts of radio activity were also detected in fat (3–8%), 
the liver (4–8%), and plasma (2–7%). Small quantities were found in the stomach, 
intestines, spleen, kidneys, h eart, and lungs. The bladder tr ansitional epithelium showed a 
higher concentration of bound radioactivity than did bladder muscle. In liver, kidney, bladder muscle, and bladder epithelium, the majority of radioactivity was bound to 
protein, while smaller amounts were bound to DNA. 
The differential serum protein-binding of benzidine- and benzidine congener-based 
dyes and derivatives was studied by use of crossed immuno-electrophoresis (X-IEP) 
techniques. The binding of these chemicals to certain serum proteins could be observed in  BENZIDINE 225  
 electrophoretic and immunoprecipitation patterns in X-IEP. Benzidine- and 
dimethylbenzidine-based dyes bound to albumin α1-lipoprotein, β-lipoprotein, and 
hemopexin, whereas benzidine and di methylbenzidine did not produce any 
electrophoretic shifts. However, autoradiog raphic analyses with benzidine and 3, 3 ′-
dimethylbenzidine did show binding of benzidine to both α1- and β-lipoprotein 
precipitation peaks. Although the physiologi cal or pathological consequences of dye-
binding to these serum proteins are not well understood, dyes derived from benzidine and 
its congeners may be carried by the proteins to different parts of the cell. For example, α1-
lipoprotein delivered the dyes to macrophage lysosomes where they inhibited several lysosomal enzymes, causing prolonged im pairment of macrophage function with 
teratogenic, anti-immune, and potentially carcinogenic consequences (Crowle & May, 
1982; Emmett et al. , 1985). 
4.1.3  Metabolism 
(a) Humans 
Cerniglia et al.  (1982) studied the metabolism of the azo-dye Direct Black 38 in 
intestinal bacteria and found that the azo linkage in Direct Black 38 was reduced by 
azoreductase in these bacteria, resulting in release the carcinogen benzidine. Chung et al.  
(1978) reported that many intestinal bacter ia isolated from faeces of patients with 
polyposis could reduce azo dyes. The bacteria is olated from intestine and/or the skin was 
also reported to have azoreductase activity (Chung et al. , 1992; Chung & Stevens, 1993; 
Chen, 2006; Platzek et al. , 1999; Xu et al. , 2007). The azoredu ctase in different 
preparations was affected by various dietar y factors such as cellulose, proteins, fibres, 
antibiotics, or suppleme ntation with live cultur es of lactobacilli (Chung et al. , 1992). 
Many benzidine congener-based dyes including 3, 3 ′-dimethylbenzidine, 3, 3 ′-
dimethoxybenzidine, and 3, 3 ′-dichlorobenzidine were also reported to be reduced by 
azoreductase in intestinal bacteria and/or ot her environmental microorganisms to release 
the benzidine congeners and many other metabolites such as monoacetyl- and diacetylbenzidine and their congener s (Bowman & Nony, 1981; Bowman et al. , 1982, 
1983; Manning et al. , 1985; Cerniglia et al. , 1986). These metabolites were also detected 
in workers exposed to these azo dyes, benzid ine or benzidine-based pigments (Vigliani & 
Barsotti, 1961; Haley, 1975, 1982). Therefore,  azo-reduction was considered the first step 
of azo dye- induced carcinogenesis (Chung, 1983; Chung & Cerniglia, 1992) and control 
of azoreduction becomes important in azo dye-induced cancer (Chen et al. , 2006). It 
should be pointed out that metabolic conversion of benzidine-, 3, 3 ′-dimethybenzidine- 
and 3, 3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine-based  dyes to their respect ive carcinogenic amine 
precursors in vivo is a gene ral phenomenon: exposure to be nzidine-based dyes has caused 
bladder cancer in humans. However, studies in which azo pigments based on 3, 3 ′-
dichlorobenzidine such as Pigment Yellow 12 had been orally administered to rats, 
hamsters, rabbits, and monkeys did not generally show significant amounts of 3, 3 ′-226 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 dichlorobenzidine in the urine.  The aromatic amine components from azo pigments based 
on 3, 3′-dichloro-benzidine a ppear not to be readily bio-available. Therefore, it seems 
unlikely that occupational exposure  to insoluble azo pigments (3, 3 ′-dichloro-benzidine-
based azo dyes such as Pigment Yellow 12) wo uld be associated with a substantial risk 
for bladder cancer in humans (Golka et al. , 2004). 
Since benzidine is the major mutagenic and carcinogenic moiety of carcinogenic azo 
dyes (Chung & Cerniglia, 1992) the mechanisms of activation of benzidine have been 
extensively studied (Morton et al. , 1979). 
Rothman et al.  (1996a) conducted a cross-sectiona l study of workers exposed to 
benzidine and benzidine-based dyes, and unexposed controls. Benzidine, N-acetyl-
benzidine, and N,N′-diacetylbenzidine were not detected in the urine of control subjects. 
Urinary levels of these compounds were low in workers producing benzidine-based dyes 
and about 17-fold higher in workers manufacturing benzidine. Upon analysis by 32P-
postlabelling, four DNA adducts were found to be  significantly elevated  in urothelial cells 
of exposed workers compared with controls, the predominant adduct being N-
(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)- N′-acetylbenzidine. This is the only  adduct that was significantly 
associated with the total amount  of urinary metabolites of be nzidine. These results suggest 
that N-monoacetylation is involved in activation of benzidine, while N-diacetylation is 
likely part of a detoxification pathway. In this study, there was no significant association 
between NAT2  genotype and adduct levels. 
Zenser et al.  (1996) assessed N-acetylation of benzidine to N-acetylbenzidine by use 
of human recombinant NATs. Km and V max values were higher for NAT1 than for NAT2. 
The clearance ratios (NAT1/NAT2) for benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine were 54 and 
535, respectively, sugges ting that NAT1 is a more efficient enzyme for N-acetyl-
benzidine than NAT2. The much high er Km values of NAT1 and NAT2 for N-acetyl-
benzidine compared with benzidine appear to favour the metabolism of benzidine over 
that of N-acetylbenzidine, for low exposures. 
In human liver slices incubated with [3H]-labelled benzidine, the relative amounts of 
benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine, and N,N′-diacetylbenzidine were 19 ± 5, 34 ± 4, and 
1.6 ± 0.5%, respectively. Similar results were  observed if slices were incubated with [3H]-
acetylbenzidine instead of [3H]-benzidine (Zenser et al. , 1996). Thus, in these studies, 
conditions in liver slices favour the formation of N-acetylbenzidine rather than N,N′-
diacetylbenzidine. With paraoxon, a d eacetylase inhibitor, the formation of N,N′-diacetyl-
benzidine increased 32-fold. para-Aminobenzoic acid, a NAT1-selective substrate, 
increased the amount of benzidine and decreased the amount of N-acetylbenzidine 
produced, resulting in a decreased ratio of acet ylated products. This is consistent with 
benzidine being an NAT1 substrate. Individuals with rapid NAT2  genotypes did not form 
significantly more N-acetylbenzidine than did slow acetylators. There was no apparent 
correlation of N,N′-diacetylbenzidine formation with NAT2  genotype. HPLC analysis of 
the liver-slice extracts detected N-glucuronides of both benzidine and N-acetyl-benzidine.  BENZIDINE 227  
 These N-glucuronides represent 7 and 16%, respec tively, of the to tal radioactivity 
recovered by HPLC (Zenser et al. , 1996). 
Ciotti et al.  (1999) assessed the capacity of five different human recombinant UDP-
glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) expressed in COS-1 cells. [14C]-Labelled UDP-
glucuronic acid was used as a co-substrate. Benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine, and N,N′-
diacetylbenzidine, the N-OH derivatives of acetyl- and diacetylbenzidine, the 3-OH 
derivatives of diacetylbenzidine and benzidine were used as substrates. N,N′-diacetyl-
benzidine was not a substrate for glucuronidation. UGT1A9 showed the highest relative 
rate of metabolism, with a preference for the N-OH derivatives of acetyl- and diacetyl-
benzidine. The overall results suggest the following relative ranking of transferase 
metabolism: UGT1A9 > UGT1A4 >> UGT2B7 > UGT1A6 ≈ UGT1A1. 
Since the N-glucuronides of benzidine and N-acetyl-benzidine are acid-labile (Babu et 
al., 1992; 1993), this pr operty was used to indirectly  assess these glucuronides in urine 
from workers in India manufacturing benzidin e or benzidine-based dyes, in comparison 
with those from workers at a construction co mpany. The pH of post-workshift urine was 
inversely correlated with the proportions of benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine present as 
free (non-glucuronidated) compounds. When controlling for internal dose, individuals 
with urine at pH < 6 had a tenfold higher level of the deoxy-guanosine adduct of 
acetylbenzidine in their exfoliated bladder cells , compared with subjects with urine at pH 
≥ 7 (Rothman et al. , 1997). These results sugg est that a low pH of the urine may be a risk 
factor in bladder cancer. 
In both bladder cells and white blood cells , dGp-acetylbenzidine is the major adduct 
(Zhou et al.  1997). The sum of urinary benzidine metabolites (benzidine, N-acetyl-
benzidine, and N,N′-diacetylbenzidine) is an index of internal dose th at correlates with the 
level of the dGp-acetylbenzidine adduct in bo th peripheral white blood cells and in 
exfoliated bladder cells. Moreover, adduct levels in human peripheral white blood cells 
correlate with those in exfoliated bladder ce lls. Similar mechanisms of adduct formation 
may exist in both cell types, with white bl ood cells serving as a surrogate biomarker. 
Thus, dGp-acetylbenzidine is an important adduct, and human peripheral white blood 
cells are a relevant cell type for studying this adduct formation. 
Lakshmi et al.  (2000a; 2000b) assessed the metabol ic pathways leading to dGp-
acetylbenzidine formation in human peripheral white blo od cells. Transformation of [3H]-
labelled acetylbenzidine wa s assessed by use of myeloperox idase (MPO) or hypochlorous 
acid (HOCl). MPO-mediated metabolism required H 2O2. While transformation by HOCl 
was completely inhibited by 10 mM taurine,  the metabolism of acetylbenzidine by MPO 
was only reduced 56%. Tran sformation by either MPO or HOCl was inhibited by 100 
mM 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), 1 mM glutathione, and 1 mM ascorbic 
acid. Two previously identified oxid ation products of  acetylbenzidine, N′-hydroxy- N-
acetylbenzidine and 4 ′-nitro-4-acetylaminobiphenyl, were not detected. With DNA or 
dGp present, a new product was observed that corresponded to synthetic dGp-
acetylbenzidine. The HOCl-derive d adduct was identified by electrospray-ionization mass 228 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 spectrometry (ESI/MS) and NMR as dG p-acetylbenzidine. Upon analysis by 32P-
postlabelling, dGp-acetylbenzidine increased mo re than 300-fold if either DNA or dGp 
was present. Indomethacin (0.1mM) did not a lter adduct formation. These results are 
consistent with human neutrophils forming dGp-acetylbenzidine by a peroxidative 
mechanism involving MPO. 
Studies with many aromatic amines an d human liver microsomes (Beland & 
Kadlubar, 1990) and with acetyl benzidine and rat-liver micr osomes have demonstrated 
CYP-mediated N-oxidation (Lakshmi et al. , 1997). With rat-liver microsomes, N′-
hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine is formed. However, N-oxidation of acetylbenzidine with 
human liver microsomes has not been demonstrated. 
(b) Experimental systems 
N-Acetylation plays an important role in biotransformation of aromatic amines and 
was assessed for benzidine. In rat-live r slices incubated with 0.05 mM [3H]-labelled 
benzidine, the acetylated products N-acetylbenzidine and N,N′-diacetylbenzidine 
represented 8.8 ± 3.6 and 73 ± 2.5%, respectively, of the total radioactivity recovered after HPLC (Lakshmi et al. , 1995a). No unmetabolized benzidine was observed. 
Excretion of aromatic amines is facilitate d by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). 
When N-glucuronidation of benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine was assessed, microsomes 
from dog and rat produced an identical new HPLC peak, which was dependent upon the 
presence of UDP-glucuronic acid (Babu et al. , 1992, 1993). Whether incubated in the 
presence or absence of detergents, micr osome-catalysed glucuronidation of N-acetyl-
benzidine and N,N
′-diacetylbenzidine decreased as follows: human > dog > rat. No 
glucuronidation of N,N′-diacetylbenzidine was observed, which is consistent with the lack 
of glucuronidation of arylamides (Babu et al. , 1993). To determine the specificity of the 
UGT reaction with benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine, a wide ra nge of inhibitors (known 
substrates) was tested. Results were consistent with multiple transferases metabolizing 
benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine. 
To correlate results with microsomal glucuronidation to those in intact tissues, dog-
liver slices were incubated with 0.05 mM [3H]-labelled benzidine. An HPLC peak 
corresponding to the glucuronide conjugate of benzidine represented as much as 30% of the total radioactivity recovered (Babu et al. , 1992). Neither benzidine nor 
acetylbenzidine glucuronide was detected unde r these incubation conditions with rat liver, 
which rapidly N-acetylates benzidine to acetyl- and diacetylbenzidine (Babu et al. , 1993; 
Lakshmi et al. , 1995b). This is consistent with N-acetylation and N-glucuronidation being 
competing pathways and likely playing a role in benzidine-induced liver cancer in rats 
and bladder cancer in dogs and humans (Case et al. , 1954; Haley, 1975). 
The pH of the urine is affected by diet an d was considered to be a potential modifier 
of benzidine-induced bladder carcinogenesis. After 4 or 5 min at pH 5.3 and 37ºC, half of 
the N-glucuronides of benzidine and acetylbenzidin e are hydrolysed to their parent amine 
(Babu et al. , 1992; 1993). At pH 7.4, the half-l ives of these glucuronides are 104 and 140  BENZIDINE 229  
 min, respectively. The O-glucuronides of th e hydroxamic acids, N-hydroxy- N-acetyl-
benzidine and N-hydroxy- N,N′-diacetylbenzidine, were not acid-labile. The N-
glucuronide of N′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine was acid-labile, with a half-life at pH 5.5 of 
3.5 hours, compared with 7.5 min for the N-glucuronide of acetylbenzidine. Thus the N-
glucuronide of N-acetylbenzidine is much more likely  to be involved in acidic urine-
catalysed hydrolysis than is its N-hydroxy N-glucuronide. The glucuronides of 4-
aminobiphenyl and N-OH-4-aminobiphenyl were both aci d-labile with half-lives of 10 
and 32 min, respectively, at pH 5.5 (Babu et al. , 1996). In contrast, the O-glucuronide of 
N-OH- N-acetyl-4-aminobiphenyl was not acid-labile , with half-lives at pH 5.5 and 7.4 of 
55 and 68 min, respectively. Thus other N-glucuronides of aromatic amines are also acid-
labile and may have a shorter half-life than their corresponding N-OH N-glucuronides. 
O-Glucuronides are not acid-labile (Babu et al. , 1996). 
To evaluate NADPH-dependent oxidation of benzidine, Lakshmi et al.  (1996) used 
liver microsomes from control and β-naphthoflavone-treated rats. Beta-naphthoflavone 
treatment increased the metabolism of benzidin e compared with the control, as judged 
from the HPLC metabolite-profile and protein/DNA binding. The CYP inhibitors 
ellipticine and α-naphthoflavone, select ive for CYP1A1/1A2, elicited 50% inhibition at 
approximately 0.2 and 0.5 μM, respectively. Mass spectro metry identified the only 
metabolite formed as 3-hydroxybenzidine. N-hydroxybenzidine formation by CYP has 
never been reported. 
CYP-induced metabolism and activation of acetyl- and diacetylbenzidine was 
assessed by incubating liver mi crosomes from control and β-naphthoflavone-treated rats 
with either substrate (Lakshmi et al. , 1997). With β-naphthoflavone-induced microsomes, 
N-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine formation was eight -fold higher than in the control: a 
significant formation of ring-oxidation products was demonstrated, and N′-hydroxy- N-
acetylbenzidine formation was at the limit of detection. With control microsomes, more 
N′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine w as produced than N-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine. While 
oxidation of diacetylbenzidine was not obser ved with control microsomes, significant N-
hydroxy- N,N′-diacetylbenzidine formation and ring-oxidation was seen with β-naphtho-
flavone treatment. Metabolism by β-naphthoflavone-induced mi crosomes was completely 
blocked by selective CYP1A1/1A2 inhibitors, α-naphthoflavone and ellipticine. N′-
Hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine formation by contro l microsomes was not prevented by these 
inhibitors. A non-specific CYP inhibitor, SKF-525A, exhibited partial dose-response inhibition of N
′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine. The adduct N′-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)- N-
acetylbenzidine was detected by 32P-postlabelling in incubations containing DNA and 
acetylbenzidine, but not diacetylbenzidine. Mo re adduct was detected with control than 
with β-naphthoflavone-treated microsomes. Thus, while N-hydroxybenzidine formation 
by CYP was not observed, acetyl- and diacetyl benzidine are substrates for these enzymes 
and form N-hydroxy metabolites. These results are consistent with CYP-mediated 
activation of acetylbenzidine to N′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine with subsequent binding to 230 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 DNA and adduct formation. This is likely a mechanism responsible for the formation of 
the dGp-acetylbenzidine adduct in humans (Lakshmi et al. , 1997). 
A study investigating the metabolism of benzidine in slices of the inner renal medulla 
of rabbits showed that benzidine induced a dose-dependent reversible inhibition of 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. Binding of [14C]-labelled benzidine metabolites to 
medullary tissue was observed. This bindi ng was increased by ar achidonic acid, and 
arachidonic acid-mediated binding was prevented by inhibitors of prostaglandin H 
synthase. Inhibitors of mixed function ox idase activity (metyrapone and SKF-525A) did 
not inhibit binding of benzidin e metabolite(s). These findings are consistent with previous 
studies and demonstrate the microsomal co-oxidative metabolism of benzidine by 
prostaglandin H synthase in  the inner medulla (Rapp et al. , 1980). 
Since the bladder is a possible site for activation of arylamine bladder carcinogens, 
the dog bladder was studied and found to contain little CYP but substantial prostaglandin 
H synthase (PHS) activity (Wise et al. , 1984). Lakshmi et al.  (1998) assessed the possible 
formation of the dGp-acetylbenzidine adduct by peroxidatic activation of acetylbenzidine. Adduct formation was measured by 
32P-postlabelling. Ram seminal vesicle microsomes 
were used as a source of PHS. The peroxidatic  activity of PHS induced formation of the 
adduct, whether DNA or dGp was present. Ad duct formation was dependent upon the 
presence of peroxidase and a specific su bstrate, i.e. arachidonic acid or H 2O2. Adduct 
formation was inhibited by indomethacin  (0.1 mM), ascorbic acid (1 mM), and 
glutathione (10 mM), but not by DMPO (1 00 mM), a radical scavenger. Since the PHS 
activity in cultured urothelial cells from humans and dogs is enhanced by bradykinin, 
calcium ionophore, arachidonic acid, and phorbol ester (Danon et al. , 1986; Zenser et al. , 
1988; 1990), a co rresponding increase in benzid ine activation could occur. 
Zenser et al.  (1999) examined the mechanism by which PHS from ram seminal 
vesicle microsomes catalyses th e oxidation of the reducing  co-factor acetylbenzidine. 
During the conversion of this compound to its final end product 4 ′-nitro-4-acetylamino-
biphenyl, a new metabolite was detected wh en 1 mM ascorbic acid was present. Similar 
results were observed whether arachidonic acid or H 2O2 was used as substrate. This 
metabolite co-eluted with synthetic N′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine but not N-hydroxy- N-
acetylbenzidine. The new metabolite was identified as N′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine by 
ESI/MS/MS. It represented as much as 10% of  the total radioactivity recovered after 
HPLC. When N′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine was substituted for N-acetylbenzidine, 4 ′-
nitro-4-acetylaminobiphenyl was formed. In hibitor studies demo nstrated that the 
metabolism was due to PHS, not CYP. Oxygen-uptake studies did not demonstrate a 
requirement for molecular oxygen. When [18O]H 2O2 was used as substrate, [18O] 
enrichment was observed. These results de monstrate a peroxidative mechanism of 
oxidation of N-acetylbenzidine and N′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine by PHS and suggest 
stepwise oxidation of  acetylbenzidine to N′-hydroxy, 4 ′-nitroso, and 4 ′-nitro products 
(Zenser et al.,  1999). In contrast, horseradish peroxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) 
appear to activate acetylbenzidine by  a radical mechanism not involving N′-hydroxy- N- BENZIDINE 231  
 acetylbenzidine (Lakshmi et al. , 1998; 2000a). Thus, dGp-acet ylbenzidine is formed by 
activation of acetylbenzidine with CYP, PH S or MPO, each representing a different 
mechanism of activation. 
To gain more insight into peroxidative activation of acet ylbenzidine, glutathione was 
used to trap the activated intermediate (Lakshmi et al. , 2000b; Zenser et al. , 2001). 
Myeloperoxidase, like horseradish peroxi dase, metabolizes acetylbenzidine by a 
mechanism that does not produce 4 ′-nitro-4-acetylaminobip henyl. While the thiol 
conjugate of horseradish peroxi dase-activated acetylbenzidine was expected to be similar 
to that formed with benzidine, i.e. 3-(glutathione- S-yl)-benzidine (Wise et al. , 1985; 
Lakshmi et al.  1994), this was not the case (Lakshmi et al. , 2000b). The product was 
identified by mass spectrometry and NMR as N′-(glutathion- S-yl)-acetylbenzidine- S-
oxide. The lack of effect of mannitol and superoxide dismutase suggests that neither the 
hydroxyl radical nor superoxide is involved in  this reaction. Studie s also indicated that 
molecular oxygen is not a source of the sulfinamide oxygen. Methaemoglobin (acting as a 
peroxidase) catalysed the formatio n of the same conjugate (Zenser et al. , 2001). The 
proposed mechanism for sulfinamide formati on, involving two cons ecutive one-electron 
oxidations with subsequent arrangement to a sulfur-stabilized nitrenium ion, suggests that 
the oxygen may be derived from water. A less ac tive ring-activated intermediate, such as 
a diimine monocation may be formed, which is a resonance structure of the acetyl-
benzidine nitrenium ion. This intermediate may play a role in the activation of 
acetylbenzidine by horseradish peroxidase (Lakshmi et al. , 1998) and MPO (Lakshmi et 
al., 2000a), leading to formation of  the dGp-acetylbenzidine adduct. 
Reduction of benzidine-based dyes is a potential source of human exposure to 
benzidine. Since aromatic amines can be ac tivated to bind haemoglobin, these adducts 
offer a method for assessing exposure. When female Wistar rats were given an oral dose 
of 0.5 mmol/kg benzidine and haemoglobin was isolated after 24 hours (Birner et al. , 
1990; Zwirner-Baier & Neumann, 1998), the haemoglobin binding index (HBI) was 2.4 (benzidine), 18.9 (acetylbenz idine), and 3.0 (4-aminobipheny l, 4-ABP). Since benzidine 
is rapidly N-acetylated in rats, acetylbenzidine adduc ts are expected. Diacetylbenzidine is 
not expected to form haemoglobin adduct s, and no adducts were detected after 
administration of this compound. The pre sence of 4-ABP adducts was unexpected, and 
demonstrates an unknown pathway of the metabolism of benzidine. This method was 
then used to monitor the bioavailability of benzidine and its metabolites following oral administration of Direct Red 28, a benzidine-derived azo-dye, at 1 mmol/kg. The HBI 
indices for benzidine, acetylbenzidine and 4-ABP were 0.3, 1.8, and 2.2. This 
demonstrates exposure to these three compounds derived from a benzidine-based dye (Birner et al. , 1990). Reactive nitric oxygen species transform benzidine to 4-ABP and 4'-
OH-4-amino-biphenyl and this reaction, involving components of the inflammatory 
response, may be a source of 4-ABP formation from benzidine in vivo  (Lakshmi et al. , 
2003). 232 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 4.1.4  Excretion 
(a) Humans 
A single oral dose of 100 mg of benzidine in humans resulted in urinary excretion of 
free benzidine and its mono- and di-acetylated derivatives. However, only less than 1 mg 
of the initial dose was recovered (Engelbertz & Babel, 1953). 
Benzidine and its metabolites were measure d in the urine of exposed industrial 
workers in March and August. The mean urin ary concentrations of the compounds after 
exposure in the spring were as follows: benzidine, 0.28 mg/L; N-acetylbenzidine, 0.27 
mg/L; N,N’-diacetylbenzidine, 0.52 mg/L; conjuga ted 3-hydroxybenzi dine, 3.9 mg/L. 
During the month of August, a mean overall concentration of 21.8 mg/L was measured 
for benzidine and its metabolites, the peak excretion being 31 mg/L. Dermal contact with 
dust containing benzidine was the primary so urce at the benzidine plants. Daily showers 
and clean working clothes reduced the quantity of benzidine and its metabolites excreted 
in the urine of exposed workers (Meigs et al. , 1951). 
Excretion of 0–363 µg/L benzidine, 6–11 17 µg/L acetylbenzidine, and 4–160 µg/L 
diacetylbenzidine was measured in  the urine of workers pote ntially exposed to several 
benzidine-based dyes. Exposure was assumed to have been largely by inhalation, but 
dermal exposure may have been significant as well (NIOSH, 1980; Dewan et al. , 1988). 
Many workers in dye, printing, warehouse, and colour room shops who were exposed 
to benzidine-based dyes includin g Direct Black 4, Direct Blue 2, Direct Brown 2, Direct 
Green 1, Direct Orange 1, Direct Orange 8, Direct Red 28, Direct Blue 6, Direct 38, and 
Direct Brown 95 excreted benzidine in thei r urine (Walker, 1970; Genin, 1977; Lynn et 
al., 1980; Robens et al. , 1980; Haley, 1982). 
(b) Animals 
(i) Rat 
Excretion of benzidine after an intravenous dose of 0.2 mg/kg in rats, dogs, and 
monkeys was 97%, 96%, and 88%, respectively, one week after dosing. Dogs and monkeys excreted benzidine via the urinary route, whereas rats used the biliary route 
(Kellner et al. , 1973). Following intravenous exposure of rats to 0.2 or 2.5 mg/kg 
radiolabelled benzidine, most  of the radioactivity (63–80% ) was excreted in the faeces 
during the first 3 to 7 days, and much less via the urine (17–29%) (Kellner et al. , 1973; 
Lynn et al. , 1984). Experiments with bile duct-cannulated rats indicated that virtually all 
fecal metabolites originated from biliary excretion. Urinary metabolites included 3-
hydroxy- N,N’-diacetylbenzidine glucuronide (25%), N,N’-diacetylbenzidine (12%), and 
N-hydroxy- N,N’-diacetylbenzidine glucuronide (4%). Metabolites and relative amounts 
were similar in bile, except that about half of the 3-hydroxy- N,N’-diacetylbenzidine 
glucuronide was replaced by the 3-glutathion- S-yl-N,N’-diacetylbenzidine conjugate 
(Lynn et al. , 1984).  BENZIDINE 233  
 After dermal application of radiolabelled benzidine to rats, radioactivity was detected 
in both urine and faeces as early as one hour after treatment. Excretion was significantly 
greater (6–8-fold) in urine than in faeces during the firs t eight hours, but it was 
comparable for both routes after 24 hours ( 23% in urine, 19% in faeces) (Shah & Guthrie, 
1983). 
In rats, the major route of excretion after single oral doses of 0.5, 5 or 50 mg/kg 
radiolabelled benzidine appeared to be via the faeces. At the lowest dose, 74% of the 
radioactivity was excreted in the faeces during the first days after exposure and only 17% 
in the urine. With increasing doses the percentage of radioactive compounds excreted in the faeces decreased, while that in the urine in creased. At the low- and mid-level doses 
(0.5 and 5.0 mg/kg), the major radioactive compounds were identified as 3-hydroxy-
N,N’-diacetylbenzidine glucuronide (39% and 37%), N,N’-diacetylbenzidine (13% and 
17%), N-hydroxy- N,N’-diacetylbenzidine gluc uronide (4% and 5%), N-acetylbenzidine 
(3% and 4%), and free benzidine (2% and 2%, respectively). At the high dose (50 mg/kg), 
the percentage of N-hydroxy- N,N’-diacetylglucuronide incr eased substantially to 24%, 
largely at the expense of N,N’-diacetylbenzidine (reduced to 4%). No radioactivity was 
detected in expired air (Lynn et al. , 1984). 
The analyses of urine and faeces after intraven ous injection of radiolabelled benzidine 
confirmed that the main excr etion route of radioactivity  was via the faeces (Kellner et al. , 
1973; Lynn et al. , 1984). However, other studies reported that benzidine, its metabolites, 
and their conjugates were excreted approxim ately equally in urine and bile/faeces (Shah 
and Guthrie, 1983; Lakshmi et al. , 1990). 
(ii) Mouse  
After injection of mice with 100 mg/kg benzidine, the following compounds were 
found excreted in the urine: benzidine (10%), N-acetylbenzidine (3.4%), N,N’-
diacetylbenzidine (2.6%), 3- hydroxy ethereal sulfate (2 9%), 3-hydroxybenzidine 
glucuronide (12%), N-hydrogen sulfate or glucuronide conjugates (18%), and 
monoacetylated 3-hydroxy ethereal sulfate or glucuronide-benzid ine conjugate (25%) 
(Sciarini & Meigs, 1961). 
(iii) Dog 
After intraperitoneal injection of benzidine, dogs excreted this compound in the urine, 
but the fecal excretion was 11 times greater th an via the urine (Sciar ini & Meigs, 1958). 
The urinary excretion in dogs after intravenous injection of  benzidine was reported to 
range from 1–2.5 times that foun d in the bile or faeces (Kellner et al. , 1973; Lakshmi et 
al., 1990). About 30% of the radioactivity excret ed in the urine or bile was free benzidine. 
3-Hydroxybenzidine was a major metabolite (6%)  found in the bile, but not in the urine. 
N-Acetylated metabolites were not found. This is  in agreement with the fact that dogs are 
deficient in N-acetyltransferase activity (Lakshmi et al. , 1990). The urinary concentration 234 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 of free benzidine ranged from 2 to 9%, and the concentration of 3-hydroxybenzidine or its 
sulfur conjugate ranged from 25 to 50%. 
(iv) Monkey  
When benzidine was intraven ously injected in three mo nkeys (0.2 mg/kg bw), the 
cumulative excretion during the first seven days varied from 30% to 70% in the urine and 
from 5 to 36% in the faeces. There were some indications of the presence of N-
acetylbenzidine, but this was not chemically confirmed (Kellner et al. , 1973). 
Oral exposure of monkeys to 10 or 100 mg benzidine resulted in urinary excretion of 
free benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine. The combined 72-hour excretion of these two 
compounds represented only a small fraction (1.5%) of the admini stered dose (Rinde & 
Troll, 1975). This contrasts with the 6% repo rted in the rat as excr eted fraction for these 
two compounds (Lynn et al. , 1984). 
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
4.2.1  Humans 
Mirkova and Lalchev (1990) studied the cytogenetic effects of occupational exposure 
to benzidine and benzidine-based  dyes (Direct Black 38 and Direct Blue 6) in workers at 
a manufacturing plant in Bulgaria, who had a recognized high risk for occupational cancer. Twenty-three workers (13 men, 10 women) , 47 ± 8.3 years of age and exposed for 
a mean of 15 years, were compared with 30  controls presumed to have had no exposure. 
A statistically significant (10-fold) increase in the number of circulating peripheral 
lymphocytes displaying chromosomal aberrations was observed in exposed workers when 
compared with controls. The highest frequenc ies of aberrant lymphocytes were associated 
with the highest airborne dust concen trations of benzidine (0.42–0.86 mg/m
3) or 
benzidine-based dyes (7.8–32.3 mg/m3), and with the highest mean levels of benzidine 
found in the urine (1.8–2.3 μg/L). The frequency of polyploid lymphocytes was also 
elevated in workers when co mpared with controls. No significant association with 
smoking was observed. A major strength of this study is the monitoring and 
biomonitoring of benzidine. These data provide clear evidence of benzidine's genotoxicity 
in humans under occupational exposure cond itions, and are in agreement with oral 
genotoxicity results from animals an d in-vitro test systems (see below). 
4.2.2 Experimental systems 
(a) In-vivo studies 
There are conflicting reports on the abilit y of benzidine to induce micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes in the rat. It w as inactive at doses of up to 250 mg/kg bw 
(Trzos et al.,  1978), but was positive (with no dose– response) when tested at comparable  BENZIDINE 235  
 doses (100, 200, 300 mg/kg bw) in another study (C ihák, 1979). It was al so reported to be 
active in inducing micronucleus formation when given at the high dose of 409 mg/kg bw, 
either dermally or subcutaneously (Urwin et al.,  1976). 
Several studies have addressed the in-vivo genotoxicity of benzidine in animals 
following oral or parenteral exposure. Although early studies were conflicting or 
equivocal, benzidine was clearly demonstrated to induce bone-marrow micronuclei in two strains of male mice (C57BL6 and CBA), 24 and 48 hours after a single administration of 
300 mg/kg bw benzidine by oral gavage (Mirkova & Ashby, 1988). The number of 
micronucleated cells per 1000 normal cells for the test groups (5.75–8.75) was three times that observed in control groups  (2.0–2.9). These findings were  extended in a subsequent 
study in which male C57BL6 mice, treated by or al gavage with either a single dose (900 
mg/kg bw) or with three consecutive dail y doses (150 or 300 mg/kg bw), showed a 
positive dose–response for bone-marrow micronucleus induction (Mirkova, 1990) [The 
Working Group noted the high doses used in some of these studies]. Negative results, 
however, were reported for a different strain  of mice (ICR), 6–8 weeks of age, treated 
with single oral gavage doses of 100 or 200 mg benzidine/kg bw. Harper et al.  (1989) 
observed no significant increases in micronucle ated cells in the bone marrow of treated 
male, female, or pregnant female mice (gestation days 16–17), nor in the livers from the fetuses of treated pregnant female mice. When given by single oral gavage to male rats, 
200 mg benzidine/kg bw induced unscheduled  DNA synthesis in liver cells, which is a 
repair response to DNA damage (Ashby & Mohammed, 1988). In a study with Swiss-albino mice, 9–13 weeks of ag e, intraperitoneal administration of benzidine to pregnant 
dams increased the frequency of micronucleat ed polychromatic eryt hrocytes in the liver 
of fetuses, which suggests that benzidin e (or metabolites) can cross the placenta 
(Sanderson & Clark, 1993). 
(b) In-vitro studies 
Benzidine has consistently been found to be mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium  
strain TA1538 when tested in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system 
from Sprague-Dawley rats (see, e.g., Ames et al.,  1973; Anderson & Styles, 1978) or 
humans (see, e.g., Neis et al. , 1985). The urine of rats fed benzidine was mutagenic to 
S. typhimurium  TA1538, TA98 or TA100 when test ed in the presence of a rat-liver 
metabolic activation system or to S. typhimurium  TA1538 in the presence of a rat-liver 
cytosolic fraction; addition of glucuronidase increased the mu tagenic activity in TA1538 
(Bos et al.,  1980). 
N-Hydroxy- N,N
′-diacetylbenzidine was mutagenic to S. typhimurium  TA1538 in the 
presence of a partially purified N,O-acyltransferase pr eparation (Morton et al. , 1979). 
Benzidine was negative in the Escherichia coli  pol A test (Fluck et al.,  1976) and in the 
prophage-induction test (Speck et al.,  1978), when tested either in the presence or absence 
of a rat-liver metabolic activation system. Mutagenic activity on the X-chromosome recessives (visibles and lethals) and RNA genes of Drosophila melanogaster  has been 236 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 reported (Fahmy & Fahmy, 1977). Benzidine (6 × 10−4 M for 30 min) inhibited DNA 
synthesis in HeLa cells in vitro  in the absence of activat ion (Painter, 1978), and in vivo  in 
renal and hepatic cells when given intraperitone ally or intragastrically to 14–18-day-old 
suckling mice in doses of 15–30% of th e LD50 (Amlacher & Ziebarth, 1979). 
Unscheduled DNA synthesis was induced by benzidine (active dose range, 10−7–10−3 
M) in HeLa cells in the presence of a phen obarbital-induced rat-li ver activation system 
(Martin et al.,  1978) and in rat hepatocytes (Williams, 1978; Brouns et al.,  1979). 
Benzidine, when tested in th e presence of a rat-liver metabolic activation system, induced 
DNA strand-breaks in Chinese hamster V79 cells (Swenberg et al.,  1976). When 
measured by the alkaline elution assay, ther e was a dose-related increase in DNA strand-
breaks in the livers of rats exposed to benzidine in vivo  (Petzold & Swenberg, 1978). 
Benzidine (2.5 μg/mL) transformed BHK21 Cl−13 cells in the presence of an Aroclor 
1254-induced rat-liver metabolic system (Ashby et al. , 1978), and was shown to 
transform Syrian hamster embryo cells (Pienta, 1980). 
When tested in many in-vitro assays pub lished since 1982 (IARC, 1982), benzidine 
has generally shown positive results for reverse mutation in Salmonella typhimurium  in 
the presence of exogenous metabolic activation ( e.g., liver S-9) (Chung et al. , 2000; 
Dorado & Pueyo, 1988; Duverger-van Bogaert et al. , 1995; Gregory et al. , 1981; Zeiger 
et al. , 1992); negative for SOS DNA repair in Escherichia coli  (von der Hude et al. , 
1988); positive for mutati on in yeast (Buchholz et al. , 1992; Mitchell & Gilbert 1991); 
positive (Oberly et al. , 1990) or negative (Phillips et al. , 1990) for gene mutation in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells ; positive (Fassina et al. , 1990; Suter et al. , 1992) or negative 
(Oglesby et al. , 1983) for gene mutation in Chinese hamster V79 cells; and positive ( Tk 
locus) or negative ( Hgprt  locus) for gene mutation in mouse-lymphoma cells (Henderson 
et al. , 1990; Myhr & Caspary, 1988). Benzidine has also given a positive response when 
tested for chromosome  breakage (Swenberg et al. , 1976) and sister chromatid exchange 
(Grady et al. , 1986; Lindahl-Kiessling et al. , 1989) in cultured human and animal cells; it 
was generally positive in cultured hepatocytes for unscheduled DNA synthesis (Kornbrust 
& Barfknecht 1984a, 1984b; Steinmetz et al. , 1988; Williams, 1978); positive for animal 
cell transformation (Ashby et al. , 1978; Pienta, 1980); and negative for DNA-adduct 
formation in cultured mammalian cells, bu t positive with calf-thymus DNA, in the 
absence of exogenous activation (Phillips et al. , 1990). 
4.2.3  Effects on cell function 
The results of a study on th e expression of mutant p53 protein in workers exposed to 
benzidine and in bladder-cancer patients (Shen et al. , 2005) indicated that the expression 
level of mutant p53 increased with the exposu re-intensity index in exposed workers; the 
expression was significantly higher in bla dder-cancer patients than in the group of 
workers with the highest ex posure-intensity index. Mo reover, there was a strong 
correlation between the Papanicolau grade of ex foliated urothelial ce lls and the expression  BENZIDINE 237  
 level or the quantity of mutant p53 protein for the higher benzidine-exposure category 
(Shen et al. , 2005). 
To investigate the expression of mutant p53 protein in relation to benzidine exposure, 
Xiang et al.  (2007) analysed mutant p53 protein by use of an immuno-polymerase chain 
reaction (immuno-PCR) method in the serum of  331 healthy benzidin e-exposed workers, 
while classifying exfoliated urothelial cells in the urine of these workers with 
Papanicolau’s grading (PG). When the workers were divided according to benzidine-
exposure level, the amounts of mutant p53 protein in the mid- and high-exposure groups 
were significantly higher than in the low-exposure group, and also significantly higher in the PG-II and PG-III groups than in the PG-I group (Xiang et al. , 2007). 
Wu and Heng (2006) found DNA lesions in exon 7 of the Tp53  gene in rats treated 
intraperitoneally with benzidine, its major targets being bladder, liver and lung. This suggests that the toxicity of benzidine is probably related to damage in the Tp53  gene 
(Wu & Heng, 2006). 
4.3 Mechanistic considerations 
Benzidine metabolism has been extensively studied (Whysner et al. , 1996, Zenser et 
al., 2002). Pathways involved in benzidine-init iated bladder cancer include the following: 
benzidine is N-acetylated to N-acetylbenzidine, which can be N-glucuronidated or N-
hydroxylated in the liver (Zenser et al.  2002). N-Glucuronides of acetylbenzidine or N
′-
OH-N-acetylbenzidine can be transported by the blood and filtere d by the kidneys, 
leading to their accumulation  in urine within the lumen of the bladder. The N-
Glucuronides are acid-labile and are converted back to N-acetylbenzidine or N′-OH- N-
acetylbenzidine in acidic ur ine. Note that while the N-glucuronide of acetylbenzidine has 
an estimated half-life of 7.5 minutes, that  for the hydroxylated acet yl-derivative is 3.5 
hours. (Babu et al.  1995). Thus, N-acetylbenzidine is more like ly to be hydrolysed than 
N′-OH- N-acetylbenzidine during a sh ort transit time of urine in  bladder. Within bladder 
cells, N′-OH- N-acetylbenzidine could react directly with DNA or, following conversion 
to the N-acetoxy derivative by N,O-acetyltransferase, form the dGp-acetylbenzidine 
adduct. N-acetyl-benzidine will require further activation before it can bind to DNA and 
form this adduct. This activation could involve N-oxidation by CYP and/or prostaglandin 
H synthase (Lakshmi et al . 1998). The dGp-acetylbenzidine adduct initiates 
carcinogenesis by producing mutations that become fixed in the genome and eventually 
contribute to tumour formation. N-Acetylation is both an activation (forming N-
acetylbenzidine) and in activation (forming N,N′-diacetyl-benzidine) reaction. dGp-
acetylbenzidine can be formed from acetylbe nzidine by several different enzymatic 
pathways. Thus, benzidine-induced initiation of bladder cancer is complex, involving 
multiple organs (i.e. liver, kidney, an d bladder) and metabolic pathways (i.e. N-
acetylation, N-glucuronidation and N-oxidation by CY P and/or peroxida tion) (see Figure 
4.1). 238 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 BENZIDINE 239  
  
The results obtained in recent years are comp atible with what could be expected from 
the present understanding of the mode of actio n of aromatic amines. However, there are 
still some unanswered questions. Why does be nzidine not produce bladder tumours in the 
rat in contrast to several other species? Alt hough the data are in favour of a genotoxic 
mechanism, not all species-specific differences can be explained by metabolic activation 
(Whysner et al. , 1996). Interestingly, little is known about the acute toxicity of benzidine, 
except that it does not stimulate but rather inhibits cel l proliferation. 
One of the most advanced approaches u ses quantitative single-cell proteomics to 
select biomarkers of effect and to develop pr ofiles of the sequence of events in a complex 
network of signalling pathways in bladder cancer (Hemstreet & Wang, 2004). A comprehensive view was obtained of the alterations induced by reactive metabolites of 
4-aminobiphenyl by gene-expression profiles in human lymphoblasto id TK6 cells. The 
activity of 2250 genes was altere d by treating these cells with N-hydroxy-
acetylaminobiphenyl. Gene-expression patte rns have been linked in this way to 
phenotypic markers, such as DNA-adduct levels , toxicity and mutagenicity. So far, the 
results tell us something about the complexity  of the responses of a cell exposed to a non-
physiological agent, which should caution against searching for monocausal explanations 
and pathways (Ricicki et al. , 2006, Srinivas et al. , 2001). The gene-exp ression profile in 
livers from mice fed N-2-acetylaminofluorene in combination with partial hepatectomy 
showed that from 2304 cDNA clones 69 were upregulated in comparison with the 
expression seen after partial hepatectomy alone. The increased gene expression may be 
associated with the activa tion of oval cells (Arai et al. , 2004). 
4.4 Susceptibility 
Taking into account that extensive epidemiological studies have indicated a 
relationship between bladder cancer in populations exposed to arylamines and the slow 
phenotype for their acetylation, the knowledge  of the human acetylator phenotype may be 
a useful indicator of possible risk for bladder cancer due to exposure to these chemicals. 
Within the same human liver preparations, be nzidine and sulfamethazine acetylation were 
directly and significantly correlated (r = 0.672; P < 0.05) (Peters et al. , 1990). 
In rat-liver slices incubated with [3H]-labelled benzidine, N,N
′-diacetylbenzidine 
represented 73 ± 2.5% of the total radioactivity recovered by HPLC, N-acetylbenzidine 
represented 8.8 ± 3.6%, while no unmetabolized benzidine was observed. In human liver 
slices, benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine, and N,N′-diacetylbenzidine represented 19 ± 5%, 
34 ± 4% and 1.6 ± 0.5%, resp ectively. Thus in human liv er slices the formation of N-
acetylbenzidine rather than N,N′-diacetylbenzidine is favour ed. Individuals with rapid N-
acetyltransferase 2 ( NAT2 ) genotypes formed 1.4-fold more N-acetylbenzidine than did 
slow acetylators, but this increase was not sign ificant. These data suggest that in humans 
the enzyme deacetylase influences hepatic meta bolism of benzidine and its subsequent 240 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 carcinogenic effects more than N-acetyltransferase, and helps to explain the species- and 
organ-specificity of benzidine- induced carcinogenesis (Lakshmi et al. , 1995a). 
According to a cross-sectional study among 33 workers exposed to benzidine and 
15 unexposed controls (Rothman et al. , 1996a), four benzidine-related DNA adducts were 
significantly elevated in the exfoliated urothelial cells of exposed workers compared with 
controls. The predominant adduct co-chromatographed with N-(3′-phosphodeoxy-
guanosin-8-yl)- N′-acetylbenzidine and it was the only ad duct significantly associated with 
total urinary benzidine metabolites (r = 0.68; P < 0.0001). This supports the concept that 
monofunctional acetylation is an activation rather than a detoxification step for benzidine. Almost all benzidine-related metabolites measu red in the urine of exposed workers were 
acetylated among slow acetylators as we ll as rapid acetylators (95 ± 1.9% vs 97 ± 1.6%), 
and NAT2 activity did not affect the levels  of any DNA adduct measured; it is thus 
unlikely that inter-individual variations in NAT2 function are relevant for benzidine-
associated bladde r carcinogenesis. 
The glutathione S-transferase M1-null ( GSTM1-null ) genotype had no impact on 
DNA adducts in urothelial cells and urinary mutagenicity levels in workers currently 
exposed to benzidine, and GSTM1 did not conjugate benzidine or its metabolites. These 
results led to the co nclusion that the GSTM1-null genotype does not have an impact on 
bladder cancer caused by benzidine. This is in  contrast to studies in the general population 
suggesting that subjects with the GSTM1-null  genotype are at a higher risk for bladder 
cancer (Rothman et al. , 1996b). 
Studies designed to assess the metabolism of benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine by the 
N-acetyltransferases NAT1 and NAT2, conducted  with human recombinant NAT1 and 
NAT2 and human liver slices, indicated that benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine are 
substrates of NAT1. N-acetylation of benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine did not correlate 
with the NAT2  genotype. A higher average acetylatio n ratio was observed in human liver 
slices possessing the NAT1*10  compared with the NAT1*4  allele, suggesting that NAT1  
may exhibit a polymorphic expr ession in human liver (Zenser et al. , 1996). 
The results of studies performed to assess the role of GSTP1  polymorphism in the 
development of benzidine-related bladder cancer (Ma et al. , 2003) indicated that carriers 
of the GSTP1 AG  or GC genotypes are found more freque ntly, but not to a significant 
extent (OR = 1.95; 95% CI 0.70–5.46), among benzidine-exposed bladder-cancer patients 
than in benzidine-exposed workers withou t known disease. Significant differences were 
found between all benzidine workers withou t known disease and all workers with known 
disease with respect to the degr ee of changes in exfoliated urothelial cells. These findings 
show the existence of an association between the GSTP1 AG  or GC genotype and higher 
cytological gradings of exfoliated urothelial cells from formerly benzidine-exposed 
workers. 
Inflammation and infection may play an important role in the activation of benzidine. 
As a matter of fact, reactiv e nitrogen/oxygen species (RNOS), which are components of 
the inflammatory response, were found to react with benzidine forming azo-benzidine.  BENZIDINE 241  
 Glutathione prevented the RNOS-mediated transformation of benzidine (Lakshmi et al. , 
2003). 
A study to evaluate the influence of urinary pH on the levels of free benzidine and N-
acetylbenzidine and on DNA adducts in urothelial ce lls (Rothman et al. , 1997) 
demonstrated that individuals with urine at pH < 6 had tenf old higher DNA-adduct levels 
than did individuals with urine at pH ≥ 7. The pH of the urine was inversely correlated 
with the proportion of benzidine (r = –0.78; P < 0.0001) and N-acetylbenzidine (r = –
0.67; P < 0.0001) present as free components. 
N′-(3′-monophospho-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)- N-acetylbenzidine was the major adduct 
detected in bladder cells from workers exposed to benzidine, and an inverse relationship 
was observed for the pH of the urine and levels  of this adduct, as well as for urinary pH 
and levels of free (unconjugated) benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine (Zenser et al. , 1998). 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
Benzidine has been u sed for over a century, mainly fo r the production of azo dyes and 
as a rubber-compounding agent. 3,3 ′-Dimethylbenzidine ( ortho -tolidine) is produced 
mainly as an intermediate for dyes and pigmen ts but also for manufacturing polyurethane-
base elastomers. 3,3 ′-Dichlorobenzidine is used primarily in the production of yellow, and 
some red and orange pigments for the printing ink, textile, paper, paint, rubber, plastic, and related industries. It also has applicatio n as a compounding ingredient for rubber and 
plastics. 3,3 ′-Dichlorobenzidine is also used with 4,4’-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) 
(MOCA) as a curing agent for polyurethane elastomers. 3,3 ′-Dimethoxybenzidine ( ortho -
dianisidine) is used almost exclusively for the production of azo dyes and azo pigments. 
Benzidine and its congeners are not known to  occur naturally. Occupational exposure 
occurs during their production and use. Only  studies for benzidine itself are available. 
Airborne concentrations in the work place reached maximum values of 6 mg/m
3, 
measured in Russia in 1947–1948.  In more recent studies, from China (1962–1970) and 
the Republic of Korea (1998), the maximum values were 1.18 and 0.65 mg/m3, 
respectively. 
Since benzidine-based dyes are known to be metabolized to benzidine, exposure 
studies in workers have measured the benzid ine concentration in urine. The highest 
reported value was 56 mg/L (Russia 1937–1938). In a dye-manufacturing industry in 
India, values up to 0.36 mg/L were measured. 
The general population can be exposed when living near factories or disposal sites, 
through plant effluents or groundwater contamination. An additional source of exposure 
is the use of consumer products containing benzidine- and congener-based dyes, which 
can be contaminated with the respective amine, and also via uptake of the dyes from those 242 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 products and ensuing metabolization. The manufacturing of benzidine is now prohibited 
in the EU and several other countries, e.g. Japan, the Re public of Korea, Canada and 
Switzerland. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
Many case reports and cohort studies have  shown that occupational exposure to 
benzidine increases the risk for cancer of th e urinary bladder amo ng workers in various 
countries. The studies show consistent positive associations with some indication of dose–
response relationships. 
In addition, studies that have documente d a decreasing bladder-cancer risk in 
occupational cohorts after removing ex posures to benzidine support a causal 
interpretation of the observed association between benzidine exposure and bladder cancer. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
Benzidine or its dihydrochloride salt was tested in mice, rats, hamsters and dogs by 
oral administration, in mice and rats by subcutaneous administration and in rats by 
inhalation and intraperitoneal injection. Following oral administration to newborn and adult mice of different strains and of both sex es, it significantly in creased the incidence of 
benign and malignant liver tumours. In female rats, it markedly increased the incidence of 
mammary tumours; in male and female hams ters, it increased the incidence of liver 
tumours; and in dogs it produced bladder tumours. The subcutaneous administration of 
benzidine or its sulfate to mice produced si gnificant increases in the incidence of benign 
and malignant liver tumours. In rats, benzidine produced a high incidence of Zymbal-gland tumours; colonic tumours were also reported. The intraperitoneal administration of 
benzidine to rats resulted in a marked incr ease in the incidence of mammary and Zymbal-
gland tumours. Studies in fish, rabbits and frogs could not be evaluated. The results of the inhalation study in rats could not be interpreted. 
3,3′-Dichlorobenzidine or its dihydrochloride salt was tested in mice, rats, hamsters 
and dogs by oral administration,  in mice by transplacental e xposure and in mice and rats 
by subcutaneous administration. Wh en administered in the diet, 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine 
induced hepatomas in male mice, granulocy tic leukaemia and Zymbal-gland carcinomas 
in male rats, mammary adenocarcinomas in rats of both sexes, and transitional cell 
carcinomas of the urinary bladder and hepatocellular carcinomas in female dogs. When 
administered by transplacental exposure, 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine in creased the incidence 
of lymphoid leukaemia in mice. A feeding study in hamsters and the studies with subcutaneous administration in mice and rats could not be evaluated. 
3,3′-Dimethoxybenzidine was tested in mice, rats and hamsters by oral 
administration. When given by stomach intubation to both male and female rats, 3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine caused tu mours at various sites, incl uding the Zymbal gland, the  BENZIDINE 243  
 intestine (carcinoma), skin (carcinoma), and urinary bladder (papilloma). When the 
dihydrochloride salt of 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine was admini stered in the drinking-water 
to male and female rats, increased inciden ces of Zymbal-gland tumours (adenoma and 
carcinoma), liver neoplasms and tumours (neoplastic nodules and hepatocellular 
carcinoma), large intestine tumours (adenom atous polyps and ad enocarcinoma), skin 
tumours (basal-cell adenoma and carcinoma), and oral cavity tumours (squamous-cell papilloma and carcinoma) were  observed. Male rats also had increased incidences of 
tumours of the preputial gland, the small intestine (adenocarcinoma), and mesothelioma, 
and female rats had increased incidences of tumours of the clitoral gland (adenoma and carcinoma), mammary gland (adenocarcinoma), and uterus or cervix (adenoma and 
carcinoma). A feeding study in ha msters could not be evaluated. 
3,3′-Dimethylbenzidine was tested in mice, rats and hamsters by oral administration 
and in rats by subcutaneous administration. Oral exposure of mice of both sexes to 
3,3′-dimethylbenzidine in  the drinking-water as the dihydrochloride salt caused increased 
incidences of lung tumours (alveolar-cell adenomas and ad enocarcinomas). Oral exposure 
of rats of both sexes to 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine in th e drinking-water as the 
dihydrochloride salt increased  the incidence of Zymbal-gland tumours (adenomas and 
carcinomas), liver tumours (neoplastic nodu les or hepatocellular carcinomas), large 
intestine tumours (adenomatous polyps or adenocarcinomas), skin tumours (basal cell 
adenomas and carcinomas), and oral cavity tumours (squamous cell papillomas and 
carcinomas) in both males and females; pr eputial gland tumours (carcinomas), small 
intestine tumours (adenocarcinomas) and lung  tumours in males; and clitoral gland 
tumours (adenomas and carcinomas) and mammary gland tumours (adenocarcinomas) in 
females. In rats, subcutaneous injection of 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine caused significant 
increases in Zymbal-gland tumours in both sexes and skin, preputial gland and 
forestomach tumours in males and mammary gland tumours in females. A feeding study 
in hamsters could not be evaluated. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
Pathways involved in benzidine-initiated bladder cancer include the following steps in 
human metabolism: benzidine is N-acetylated to acetylbenzidine, which can be 
N-glucuronidated or N-oxidized in the liver. N-Glucuronides of acetylbenzidine or 
N-hydroxyacetylbenzidine  can be transported by the blood and filtered by the kidneys, 
which results in accumulation in urine within the lumen of the bladder. N-Glucuronides 
are acid-labile and could be converted to acetylbenzidine or N
′-hydroxy- N-acetyl -
benzidine in acidic urine.  Note that while the N-glucuronide of acet ylbenzidine has an 
estimated half-life of 7.5 minutes, that for N′-hydroxy- N-acetyl -benzidine is 3.5 hours at 
pH 5.5. Thus, acetyl-benzi dine is more likely to  be hydrolysed than N′-hydroxy- N-acetyl -
benzidine during a short transit time of urin e in the bladder. Within bladder cells, N′-
hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine could react directly with DNA, or following conversion to the 244 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 N-acetoxy derivative by O-acetyltransferases, form the adduct N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-  
N′-acetylbenzidine (dGp-acetylbenzidine). Acetyl-benzidine requires further activation 
before it can bind DNA and form this adduct. This activation could involve N-oxidation 
by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and/or prostaglandin H synthase. The adduct dGp-
acetylbenzidine initiates carcin ogenesis by producing mutations  that become fixed in the 
genome and eventually contribute to tumour  formation. Levels of this DNA adduct in 
human peripheral white blood cells correlat e with those in exfoliated bladder cells. 
Benzidine can be metabolized to 4-aminobiphenyl and form haemoglobin adducts in rats. 
Thus, initiation of bladder cancer by benzidine is complex, involving multiple organs (i.e. liver, kidney, and bladder) and metabolic pathways (i.e. N-acetylation, N-glucuronidation 
and N-oxidation by CYP enzymes or peroxidation). Uroepithelial cells contain substantial 
prostaglandin H synthase activity along with bladder infiltration with polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes. Myeloperoxidase activity, an index of infiltration with neutrophils, has also 
been observed. Both pe roxidases could contribute to the activation of acetylbenzidine in 
bladder epithelium. 
Conjugates of benzidine and free benzidine, 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine and 3,3 ′-
dimethoxybenzidine have been measured in ur ine of workers exposed to benzidine-based 
azo dyes, and more specifically to Direct Black 38. One study reported formation of 
haemoglobin adducts derived from benzidin e, acetylbenzidine, 4-aminobiphenyl and 
aniline in workers exposed to Direct Black  38. Likewise, studies in rhesus monkeys, 
Syrian golden hamsters, dogs and rats exposed  to various dyes based  on benzidine, 3,3 ′-
dimethylbenzidine and 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine, e.g., Direct Black 38, Direct Blue 6 and 
Direct Brown 95, consistently show the pr esence of the free amines or acetylated amines 
in the urine. In addition, sever al studies demonstrated anaerobic  bacteria in the intestine of 
mice, rats and humans to be capable of cl eaving the azo-linkage in the dyes, thereby 
liberating the amine. 
Benzidine has been found mutagenic to Salmonella  when tested in the presence of an 
exogenous metabolic system from ra ts as well as from humans. Also N-acetylbenzidine 
and N-hydroxy- N,N
′-diacetylbenzidine, which are urinar y metabolites of benzidine in the 
rat, were positive in Salmonella  in the presence of an activation system. The urine of rats 
that received benzidine in the food was mutagenic to Salmonella  in the presence of 
metabolic activation. 
Benzidine consistently showed negative results in E. coli  tests. Mutagenic activity in 
the X-linked recessive lethal assay and i nduction of mutations in RNA genes of 
Drosophila  has been reported. 
Benzidine was tested in many in-vitro assa ys in cultured mammalian cells; positive 
and negative results were observed in gene-mutation tests. Benzidine was active in tests 
for DNA fragmentation and induction of sister chromatid exchange in cultured human 
and animal cells; benzidine was generally active in inducing unscheduled DNA synthesis in cultured hepatocytes of rats.  BENZIDINE 245  
 In-vivo tests in animals showed conflicting  results with respect to the ability of 
benzidine to induce micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes, but several studies 
demonstrated micronucleus induction in mice treated orally with a wide range of doses (150 to 900 mg/kg bw). 
When benzidine was administered to pregna nt female mice, no significant increase in 
the micronucleus frequency was observed in the liver of the fetuses. Positive results, however, were reported in a different study , in which the frequency of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes in the liver was found increased. 
There are data on genotoxic effects of benz idine in workers of a manufacturing plant 
in Bulgaria, who were exposed to benzidin e or benzidine-based dyes. A statistically 
significant (ten-fold) increase in the number of circulating peripheral lymphocytes with 
chromosomal aberrations was observed in exposed workers. The highest frequencies of 
aberrant lymphocytes were associ ated with the highest levels of exposure and correlated 
with the concentrations of benzidine found in urine. Also, mutant p53 protein was 
increased in workers exposed to benzidine.

–263– DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE  
1. Exposure Data 
See Monograph on Benzidine in this volume. 
2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
The Working Group reviewed available epidemiological st udies that evaluated the 
association between exposure to benzidine derivatives or azo dyes metabolized to 
benzidine and cancer. Three benzidine derivati ves used in the manufacture of azo dyes 
were reviewed: 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine ( ortho -tolidine), 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine ( ortho -
dianisidine), and 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine. These benzidine congeners have been evaluated 
in previous Monographs and classified in Group 2B ( possibly carcinogenic to humans ) 
(IARC, 1972, 1974, 1982, 1987). The Working Group also reviewed available human 
studies on the carcinogenicity of three azo dy es metabolized to benzidine: Direct Brown 
95, Direct Blue 6, and Direct  Black 38, all classified in Group 2A as benzidine-based dyes 
(IARC, 1982, 1987). Mo st studies that analysed th e association between benzidine 
derivatives and cancer were conducted in wo rkers employed in the manufacture of azo 
dyes. In these studies, confounding by concomitant exposure to the Group-1 carcinogens 
benzidine and 2-naphthylamine is likely, and precludes the evaluation of the effect of 
carcinogenicity by the indivi dual congeners (see Monographs on benzidine and 2-
naphthylamine in this volume). The Workin g Group was aware of studies among workers 
likely to be exposed to azo dyes metabolized  to benzidine. One of these occupational 
groups, hairdressers and barbers,  was evaluated in another Mo nograph in this volume by 
this Working Group (see Monograph on occupational exposures of hairdressers and 
barbers). Other occupations, such as shoe an d leather workers, textile workers, and 
painters, have been evaluated in previous volumes (IARC 1987, 1990, Vol 98). For this evaluation, studies on these occupations were reviewed, bu t only when they specifically 
listed exposure to benzidine derivatives or azo dyes metabolized to benzidine. In some 
instances noted below, exposure to a specific azo dye was not mentioned. 264 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 2.1 Benzidine derivatives 
2.1.1  Cohort studies  (Table 2.1)  
IARC Monograph Volume 29 (IARC, 1982) repo rted the results of three studies of 
workers exposed to 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine (Gerarde and Gerarde, 1974; Gadian, 1975; 
MacIntyre, 1975).  At the time, the Workin g Group noted that these studies examined 
relatively small cohorts of workers, and that the time since first exposure to 3,3 ′-dichloro-
benzidine was 20 or fewer years for over two th irds of the workers. Also, in the study by 
Gerarde and Gerarde (1974), follow-up of exposed workers was less than 85% complete. 
[The Working Group agreed that the signif icance of these findings is uncertain.] 
As part of a notification programme in a dye-intermediary production plant, Schulte 
et al.  (1985) identified a cohort of 1385 workers employed from 1940 to 1972. The cohort 
was potentially exposed to 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine, 2-naphthylamine, benzidine and 1-
naphthylamine, with 2-naphthylamine as the ma jor exposure. A questio nnaire was used to 
obtain information on occupational history, particularly relating to working in the 2-
naphthylamine-grinding room, u se of protective measures, and history of other jobs with 
potential exposure to bladder carcinogens. Additionally, information was obtained on 
alcohol, tobacco, coffee and artificial sweetener use, and personal health history. Follow-
up was conducted from date of first employment  until 1982. Incidence rates in the cohort 
were compared to estimated incidence rates for bladder cancer in the United States. For 
the entire cohort, 13 cases of bladder cancer were observed (overall RR, 3.9; 95% CI, 
2.2–6.8). Stratified analyses by race and leng th of employment also showed statistically 
significant associations. The most remarkable  was among black workers with invasive 
cancer and more than 10 years of employme nt (RR, 111.1; 95% CI, 35.0–352.5). The 
authors reported that, in general, black workers had jobs involving greater exposure to 2-
naphthylamine.  
In a nested case–control study, Schulte et al.  (1986) evaluated the effect of potential 
risk factors on the risk for bladder cancer. The analysis included the aforementioned 13 
bladder-cancer cases and the remaining 1372 work ers in the cohort as  controls. Workers 
were considered exposed if they had more than one year of employment or any 
employment in two departments with potential 2-naphthylamine exposure. The crude 
odds ratio between exposure and bladder cancer was 7.0 (95% CI, 3.9–12.4). The odds ratio for the association between bladder can cer and duration of employment, controlling 
for smoking and source of drinking water, was 4.3 (95% CI, 1.8–10.3). 
Sinks et al.  (1992) evaluated cancer risk at a paperboard-printing manufacturing plant 
in Georgia, USA. The cohort consisted of 2050 workers employed for more than one day, 
with duration of employment obtained through company records. Company material 
safety-data sheets were reviewed and potentia l carcinogens were identified. From supplier 
information, the authors determined th at pigments were manufactured from 3,3 ′-dichloro-
benzidine and ortho -toluidine, but these substances were not identified in laboratory tests. 
One bladder-cancer death (SMR 2.6; 95%  CI, 0.1–14.5) and one renal cell cancer 
death (SMR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.0–7. 8) were observed. For the in cidence analysis, six cases of  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 265

 renal-cell cancer were seen (SIR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.4–8.1), but no increase in bladder-cancer 
risk was observed (3 cases; SIR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.2–3.1). In a nested case–control study, the 
risk for renal-cell cancer by duration of empl oyment and department or work process was 
evaluated. Employment in the finishing depart ment for five or more years was associated 
with an increased risk for this cancer type (three cases; OR, 16.6; 95% CI, 1.7–453.1). 
The authors could not determine if workers from the finishing department were exposed 
to inks. 
Naito et al.  (1995) conducted a retrospective cohort-mortality study of 442 workers 
(437 men, 5 women) exposed to one or more substances (mainly benzidine, 2-
naphthylamine, 1-naphthylamine, and 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine) at a benzidine 
production and dye-manufacturing plant in Japan . No industrial hygien e data for the plant 
were available; therefore, duration of empl oyment at the facility was used as a surrogate 
for duration of exposure. Nineteen wo rkers were potentially exposed to 3,3 ′-dimethoxy-
benzidine during dye manufacture, and of th ese only three were e xposed solely to 3,3 ′-
dimethoxybenzidine. The authors reported th at all workers in the factory wore work 
clothes, gloves, high rubber boots, and a gas mask. An increased risk for bladder cancer 
was found among workers engaged in dye manufacture (SMR, 27.0; 95% CI, 8.8–63.0). Increased risks for cancer mortality for othe r organs were observe d, but none were 
statistically significant [results for lymphoh aematopoietic cancers were not reported]. 
Incidence rate ratios of urothelial cancer increased wi th duration of exposure ( P for trend, 
0.04). [Due to the small number of workers exposed to 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine alone or 
in combination with other arylamines, it is not  possible to attribute the increased risk for 
bladder cancer to exposure to this substance.  Furthermore, reduced exposures are likely 
due to the reported use of personal protective equipment]. 
Ouellet-Hellstrom and Rench (1996) stud ied workers at the same chemical plant 
previously studied by Meigs et al.  (1986) in Connecticut, USA. The cohort consisted of 
704 workers (585 men and 119 women) first employed at a plant during the period 1965–
89, after benzidine production was discontinued, and were therefore never exposed to 
benzidine. Workers were presumably exposed to 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine (predominantly 
used at the plant), 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine and 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine. The authors used 
personnel records at the plant and a questionnaire to obtain occupational history and 
information on other risk factors such as smoking. Each job title was assigned an 
exposure score to arylamines based on expert  judgment. An annual cumulative exposure 
score to arylamines was calculated for each worker. Expected numbers of cancers were 
estimated using cancer-incidence rates for th e state of Connecticut. Men had elevated 
SIRs for cancers of the buccal cavity, bladder, kidney, brain and testis. Only for bladder 
cancer (SIR, 8.3; 95% CI, 3.3–17.1) and tes ticular cancer (SIR, 11.4; 95% CI, 1.4–41.1) 
did this increase reach statistical signif icance. No excess of lymphohaematopoietic 
cancers was observed (SIR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.1–4. 1). The two workers with testicular cancer 
had no exposure to arylamines, and one had worked at the plant for only 15 days. Women 
had a statistically insignificant increase in br east cancer (SIR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.4–5.6). The 
SIR for bladder cancer increased  with increasing exposure. This excess bladder cancer 272 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 occurred among chemical operators (who work ed with arylamines over long periods) and 
mechanics (who had short periods of exposu re that was likely intense). The bladder 
cancer SIRs by cumulative exposure among smoke rs were higher than for the total cohort. 
[This study provides strong ev idence of the association betw een exposure to benzidine-
based dyes—or benzidine derivatives metabo lised to benzidine—and bladder cancer]. 
Rosenman and Reilly (2004) analysed a cohort of 488 white men employed in a 
chemical manufacturing facility  in Michigan, USA. The faci lity produced benzidine from 
1960 through 1972 and 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine from 1961 to 2001. Workers were 
identified from social security records. Sin ce no plant records were available, social 
security data were used to estimate time of first work and years worked. Analyses were 
conducted for the entire coho rt and separately for people who began to work in 1973 or 
later, after benzidine production was disconti nued. For the whole co hort, an excess of 
bladder-cancer mortality was observed (SMR, 8.3; 96% CI, 1.7–24.4). All cases occurred 
in those with five or more years of dura tion of work. There were six deaths from 
lymphohaematopoietic cancer (SMR, 2.8; 95%  CI, 1.04–6.2), including one from non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, one from multiple myeloma, two from chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia, one from acute leukaemia, and on e from chronic myelogenous leukaemia 
(SMR for leukaemia, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.4–12.9 ). Only one bladder cancer case (of 22 
observed) occurred among workers starting employment after 1972, when the plant was 
only producing 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine. A statistically  significant increase in mortality 
from lymphohaematopoietic cancer was observed among workers who began work in 
1973 or later. [Not enough latency among those exposed only to 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine 
may have accumulated]. 
2.2 Dyes metabolized to benzidine (Table 2.2)  
2.2.1  Case reports and proportional mortality studies 
Genin (1977) analysed the urine of 22 workers involved in the drying and grinding of 
azo dyes metabolized to benzidine (e.g. Dir ect Black 38) and dyes metabolized to 3,3 ′-
dimethoxybenzidine (e.g. Direct Blue 15) (IARC, 1982, 1993). Benzidine was found in the urine of eight workers, and 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine in the urine of three. A 
retrospective search of plant records showed five cases of bladder cancer in dryers and 
grinders. 
In a proportional mortality study of 1429 bleachers and dyers presumed to be exposed 
to dyes metabolized to benzidine in the United Kingdom, Newhouse (1978) showed no 
excess deaths from cancer of the bladder (14 deaths observed, 13.1 expected) [The 
Working Group of Volume 29 noted that the st udy was limited in that no certificates of 
deaths occurring in the first 20 years after start of exposure were available, and only 
approximately one third of the workers included in the analys is had actually been exposed 
to dyes.]  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 273

2.2.2  Cohort studies 
Stern et al.  (1987) conducted a mortality study in  a cohort of 9365 tannery production 
workers (7085 men, 2280 women), employed  at two chrome-leather tanneries in 
Minnesota and Wisconsin. The processes in bo th tanneries have remained more or less 
the same since the end of the 19th century. The authors reported detectable concentrations 
of benzidine in bulk dyes in the dye room [but exposure was likely to be due to benzidine-based dyes]. Chemical sampling was conducted at  both plants. Detectable concentrations 
(2 and 55 ppm) of benzidine in two samples of bulk dyes were found in the 
retan/colour/fat-liquor department. Occupational history was obtained from plant records; duration of employment was used as a surr ogate for cumulative exposure, and cancer 
mortality analyses for select causes also exam ined workers ever employed at specific 
departments. Expected mortality rates were calculated using US and State death rates (no 
major differences were observed in risk estim ates using both rates; only the latter are 
presented here). The authors did not observe  an excess in the risk for bladder-cancer 
mortality (tannery A: one observed death; tannery B: four observed deaths; SMR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.3–2.5). Risk was not increased for other primary sites of  cancer mortality. 
Analysis by duration of expo sure did not show increased mort ality risk for those workers 
with more than 15 years of latency (SMR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.1–1.3). The authors reported that of the five deaths from bladder cancer, four occurred among workers of tannery B, 
and two of these deaths occurred in the retan/co lour/fat-liquor departme nt (1.0 expected), 
but each of those had worked for less than two months at the tannery. 
A cohort mortality-study of 2926 male workers newly employed in tanneries between 
1950 and 1981 and with at least one period of employment of more than six months was 
conducted by Costantini et al.  (1989) in Florence and Pisa, Italy. Known exposures in the 
plants include dyes metabolized to benzidine, dyes metabolized to 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine 
and dyes metabolized to 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine. Employment in the tannery industry 
was obtained from municipal records, including beginning and end of work. Non-statistically significant increases in mortalit y were observed for cancers of the kidney, 
pancreas, lung, bladder (5 deaths; SMR, 1.5;  95% CI 0.5–3.5) and lymphohaematopoietic 
system. Analyses by latency did not show positive trends, except for bladder cancer, 
where the SMR increased with latency, although the trend was not statistically significant. 
All bladder-cancer deaths occurred in workers who entered the cohort between 1950 and 
1964. 
You et al.  (1990) conducted a retrospective cohort study among workers in 17 
knitting factories, 10 stocking factories, nine silk printing and dyeing factories and seven 
printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai, Ch ina. The cohort of 1210 workers (1060 men 
and 150 women) had worked for more than a year in weighing and formulating or dyeing, 
where they had been exposed to the dust of dyes metabolized to benz idine. Fifteen types 
of benzidine-derived dyes have been used in  these factories, and the dyes used in the  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 275  
 largest quantities included Direct Black 38. Ca ncer mortality and incidence were analysed 
among exposed workers by dividing them into two groups based on their usage of benzidine-based dyes: high exposure (> 500 kg/month) and low exposure (< 500 
kg/month). Only one case of bladder cancer w as observed in the exposed group [no risk 
estimate was provided]. 
Montanaro et al.  (1997) studied mortality in a cohort of 1244 workers employed at a 
chrome tannery in Genoa, Italy, between 1955  and 1988, where workers were exposed to 
azo dyes metabolized to benzidine and othe r chemicals used in the tanning process. 
Length of employment was obtained from plant records; information on department was 
available only for 25% of th e workers. Mortality for all cancers was 12% higher than 
expected. An excess of bladder-cancer morta lity was observed (10 deaths; SMR, 2.4; 
95% CI, 1.2–4.5) as well as an excess of colo rectal cancer deaths (SMR, 1.8; 95% CI, 
1.1–2.9). No excess deaths due to lymphoma or leukaemia were reported (SMR, 0.4; 95% 
CI, 0.01–2.0 and SMR, 0; 95% CI, 0.0–0.9, respectively). 
2.2.3  Case–control studies 
A hospital-based case–control study of 20 0 male bladder-cancer cases and 148 male 
controls of the same age range with urinary di sorders in Kyoto, Japan, showed that 17 
(8.5%) of the cases and 2 (1.4%) of the controls had worked in the silk-dyeing industry. 
The odds ratio for employment in th e silk-dyeing industry was 6.8 ( P = 0.002). At least 7 
of the 17 patients with bladder cancer who had worked in the dyeing industry were 
kimono painters, some of whom may have ingested dyes by holding brushes or spatulas 
in their mouths while working. Reportedly, benzidine-based dyes were used by these kimono painters (Yoshida, 1971). [The Working Group noted that no data on potential 
confounding factors were provided.] 
In a study in a major industri al area of Germany, Myslak et al.  (1991) selected 403 
malignant and benign bladder-cancer cases from three hospitals, and 426 controls with 
benign prostate disease from the same hospita ls. All of the cases were histologically 
confirmed. Study participants were maile d a questionnaire to obtain information on 
complete occupational history and smoking habits. The questionnaires were coded for 
occupational categories, and study  participants were classified as painters if they had been 
employed in this occupation for at least six months and did not have another occupation known to be associated with bladder cancer. Painters were of interest because benzidine-
based dyes were manufactured on a large scale in Germany before 1 950, and during that 
time painters usually prepared the paints themselves. Among the cases, 21 were painters and among the controls eight were painters. The overall relative risk for bladder cancer 
among painters was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.2–6.3). 276 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
3.1 Direct Black 38 
3.1.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse 
A group of 60 ICR mice [sex unspecified], four weeks of age, weighing 25–30 g, 
received 3000 mg/L Direct Black  38 [purity unspecified] in their drinking-water for 55–
60 weeks, at which time the 59 surviving animals were killed. Hepatocellular carcinomas 
were found in 46/59 (78%) mice, and mammary carcinomas in 20/59 (34%); nine animals developed both types of tumours. A further 40 mice were given the same concentration of 
Direct Black 38 in drinking-water, and two mice were killed every two weeks starting 
from week 16 of treatment. The first liver tu mour occurred in a mouse killed 20 weeks 
after the start of treatment. No liver or mamma ry tumour was reported in a group of 20 
untreated controls (Asada et al.,  1981). 
(b) Rat 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female Fischer 344  rats, six weeks of age, were fed a diet 
containing 0, 190, 375, 750, 1500 or 3000 mg/kg [ppm] Direct Black 38 and 1.3% corn 
oil for 13 weeks. The compound was determined by HPLC to be 87.1 ± 3.4% pure, with 
the following components: water, 7.13 ± 0.54%; NaCl, 7.9%; benzidine, < 0.004%; and 
traces of at least eight other impurities. The infrared spectrum was as expected. Surviving 
rats were killed at 13 weeks. All animals that were given 3000 mg/kg Direct Black 38 
died before termination of the experiment: male  rats survived for less than five weeks and 
female rats less than 12 weeks. Of the nine  surviving males that received 1500 mg/kg, 
four (44%) had hepatocellular carcinomas and five (55%) had neoplastic nodules. No male receiving another dose exhibited a tu mour, although 7/10 (70%) male animals given 
375 mg/kg, 9/10 (90%) males given 750 mg/kg, and 5/9 (55%) males given 1500 mg/kg 
had foci of cellular alteration or basophilic foci in the liver. Of the females, 5/10 (50%) given 1500 mg/kg exhibited neoplastic nodules in the liver at the termination of the 
experiment, and all females administered 750 or 1500 mg/kg had foci of cellular 
alteration in the liver (NTP, 1978; Robens et al.,  1980). [The Working Group noted the 
short duration of the experiment, the small nu mber of animals tested, and the impurity of 
the compound used.] 
Groups of 12–15 Wistar rats were admini stered 100 mg/L or 500 mg/L commercial 
Direct Black 38 [purity unspecified; direct Deep Black EX; benzidine-free, as shown by 
HPLC] in their drinking-water. When the eight rats of the 12  that received 100 mg/L were 
killed at 60 weeks, no tumour was observed.  Of 15 rats administered 500 mg/L Direct 
Black 38, 13 survived until 60 weeks; two (15%) papillomas and three (23%) carcinomas 
of the urinary bladder, three (23%) carci nomas of the liver and two (15%) adeno-
carcinomas of the colon were seen in six animals. No tum our was observed in a control  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 277  
 group of nine rats (Okajima et al.,  1975). [The Working Group noted the small number of 
animals.] 
A group of 20 male and 25 female rats (strain and age unspecified) were given 400 
mg/L Direct Black 38 [source and purity unsp ecified] in their drinki ng-water (0.04%) for 
14 months, at which time four males and two fe males were still alive. One of the females 
had ‘breast cancer’ [pat hological designation not specified]; no other neoplasm was noted 
(Niitsu, 1973). [The Working Group noted the poor survival of the animals and the short 
duration of the experiment; in addition, the number of control animals was not specified.] 
3.1.2  Bladder implantation 
Two groups of 50 female dopamine-deficient mice (weight, 20 g) received either a 
paraffin wax pellet (20 mg) containing 10% Dir ect Black 38 [purity unspecified] or a wax 
pellet alone implanted in the bladder. After 40 weeks, when the surviving animals were 
killed, three bladder carcinomas were observed among the 21 mice still alive. In the control group, one bladder carcinoma was ob served in 36 surviving mice (Niitsu, 1973). 
[The Working Group noted the short duration of the experiment.] 
3.2 Direct Blue 6 
3.2.1  Oral administration 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female Fischer 344 rats, six weeks old, were fed a diet 
containing 0, 190, 375, 750, 1500 or 3000 mg /kg [ppm] Direct Blue 6 and 1.3% corn oil 
for 13 weeks. The compound was determined by HPLC to be 59.9 ± 1.9% pure, with the 
following components: water, 9.18 ± 0.51%; NaCl, 20.8%; benzidine, < 0.004%; and traces of at least eight other impurities. Survivors were ki lled at 13 weeks. All animals 
that were given 3000 mg/kg Direct Blue 6 an d one male rat that received 1500 mg/kg diet 
died before termination of the study; all males given the highest dose died before five weeks on the study, and all females at th at dose were dead by  10 weeks. Liver-cell 
tumours were seen in eight of 10 (80%) males given 1500 mg/kg; two (20%) were 
hepatocellular carcinomas and six (60%) were neoplastic nodules. Of animals given 3000 
mg/kg, 1/9 (11%) males and 7/9 (78%) females were found to have liver-cell tumours at 
autopsy before the termination of the experiment: four of the tumours in females were 
hepatocellular carcinomas and three were neop lastic nodules. No neoplastic lesion was 
seen in animals of either sex given lower do ses. The first tumours appeared after four 
weeks of feeding in the males and after five weeks of feeding in the females. Almost all 
animals fed 750 or 1500 mg/kg exhibited foci of cellular alterations in the liver and some 
basophilic foci were seen in the livers of  animals receiving 3000  mg/kg. In the same 
bioassay, no increased in cidence of tumours, compared with  that in controls, was found in 
groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 750, 1500, 3000, 6000 or 12,500 mg/kg [ppm] of Direct Blue 6 and killed 13 weeks later (NTP, 1978; 278 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Robens et al. , 1980). [The Working Group noted the short duration of the experiment, the 
limited number of animals tested, and the impurity of the compound used.] 
Twenty female Wistar rats [age unspecified] were given 400 mg/L Direct Blue 6 
[purity unspecified] in their drinking-water  (0.04%) for 14 months. At 12 months, 12 
animals were still alive, and one (8%) had a squamous-cell carcinoma of the outer ear. No 
other neoplasm was found (Niitsu, 1973). [The Working Group noted the small number 
of animals and the lack of a control group.] 
3.2.2  Subcutaneous and/or intramuscular administration 
(a) Rat 
A group of 20 male and female rats (strain unspecified), 3–4 months of age and 
weighing 100–159 g, were treated with doses of 10 mg Direct Blue (purity, 97%) by 
weekly or bi-weekly subcutaneous injections up to a total dose of 200 mg. Animals 
survived less than 270 days. No tumours were seen. No control group was included 
(Fujita et al.,  1957). [The Working Group noted the poor survival and lack of proper 
controls.] 
3.2.3  Bladder implantation 
A group of 50 female dd mice (20 g) ha d either a paraffin wax pellet (20 mg) 
containing 10% Direct Blue 6 [purity unspecified] or a wax pellet without dye implanted 
in the bladder. After 40 weeks, when th e surviving animals were killed, bladder 
carcinomas were found in 3 of 21 (14%) [ P = 0.13; Fisher exact test] treated mice and in 
1 of 36 (3%) controls still alive at that time (Niitsu, 1973). 
3.3 Direct Brown 95 
3.3.1  Oral administration 
(a) Rat 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female Fischer 344 rats, 6 weeks old, were fed a diet 
containing 0, 190, 375, 750, 1500 or 3000 mg/kg [ppm] Direct Brown 95 and 1.3% corn 
oil. The compound was determined by HPLC to  be 72.2 ± 7.0% pure, with the following 
components: water, 4.99 ± 0.22%; NaCl, 14.9 %; benzidine, < 0.004%; and traces of at 
least eight other impurities. Surviving rats were  killed at 13 weeks. All male and female 
animals that received 1500 or 3000 ppm Direct  Brown 95 died before termination of the 
study: male rats survived for less than five weeks, females given the high dose survived 
less than six weeks on the study, and females fed 1500 ppm up to 12 weeks; two males 
receiving 750 ppm Direct Brown 95 also died  before the end of the study. Among male 
rats, basophilic foci or foci of cellular al teration were seen in 2/9 (22%) animals given 
3000 ppm, in 7/8 (87%) given 1500 ppm and in 8/10 (80%) given 750 ppm. Among  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 279  
 females, 4/8 (50%) given the 1500-ppm dose exhibited neoplastic nodules, and one of 
these showed a hepatocellular carcinoma; basophil ic foci or foci of cellular alteration in 
the liver were seen in 3/8 (37%) females gi ven 3000 ppm, 6/8 (75%) given 1500 ppm and 
3/10 (30%) given 750 ppm. No other relevant findings in relation to neoplastic 
development were seen in these animals.  
(b) Mouse 
In the same bioassay, groups of 10 male B6 C3F1 mice, 6–7 weeks of age, were fed a 
diet containing 750, 1500, 3000, 6000 or 12,500 ppm [ppm] Direct Brown 95 and 1.3% corn oil. Groups of 10 female B6C3F1 mice, 6–7 weeks of age, were fed similar diets 
containing 350, 750, 1500, 3000 or 6000 ppm of the dye. Control diets contained corn oil 
in amounts equal to that in the diets of  groups given the highest doses. The compound 
was administered for 13 w eeks, when all animals were  killed. The only suggestive 
neoplastic lesion observed was foci of basophilic cellular alteration in the liver of one 
male mouse administered 12,500 ppm Direct Brown 95 (NTP, 1978; Robens et al. , 1980). 
[The Working Group noted the short duration of the experiment, the limited number of 
animals tested, and the impurity of the co mpound used. Other samples of the compound 
may have different impurities.] 
3.4 CI Acid Red 114 
3.4.1  Oral administration 
Groups of 45–75 male and female F344/N rats, 5 weeks of age, received doses of 0, 
70, 150, or 300 ppm (male) or 0, 150, 300, or 600 ppm (female) of CI Acid Red 114 
(purity, 82–85%; 15 organic impurities: two re presented ~3%, benzidine < 1 ppm) in the 
drinking-water. Seventy animals were in the control and high-dose groups, 45 in the low-
dose groups, and 75 in the mid-dose groups. Te n animals were evaluated from the control 
and high-dose groups at nine months, and ten animals from all dose groups were evaluated at 15 months. The average amount of compound consumed per day was 4, 8, or 
20 mg/kg for males and 9, 21, or 69 mg/kg for females. Survival at 105 weeks for male 
rats receiving 0, 70, 150, or 300 ppm was 24/50, 15/35, 26/65, and 1/50; for females 
receiving 0, 150, or 300 ppm,  survival was 36/50,  13/35, and 6/64 (see Table 3.1). All 
female rats receiving 600 ppm had died by week 89. The decreased survival in treated 
groups was due primarily to the development of chemical-related neoplasms. Of the surviving animals,  the final mean body weights for males receiving 70 or 150 ppm were 
94% and 90% of control and for females r eceiving 150 or 300 ppm, 99% and 84% of 
control. These weight differences began in  the second year of the studies and were 
attributed in part to the development of neoplasms in the dosed groups. 280 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

NS, not significant 
At nine and 15 months, a few neoplasms were seen in the li ver, lung, clitoral gland, 
skin, Zymbal gland, oral cavity epithelium, and small and large intestine, and the 
number of neoplasms at these sites increased as the studies progressed (see Table 3.1). At 
two years, there was a clear carcinogenic respon se in the skin, Zymbal gland, and liver of 
male and female rats, and in the clitoral gland, oral cavity epithelium, small and large 
intestine, and lung in female rats. Trea tment-related increases were also seen in the 
incidence in neoplasms of the or al cavity epithelium, adrenal gl and, and lung of male rats,  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 281  
 and in mononuclear cell leukaemia and in ne oplasms of the mammary gland and adrenal 
gland in female rats. The incidence of th ese neoplasms was generally lower, but was 
significant and considered to be marginally  related to chemical treatment. The same 
neoplastic effects had been previously observed in some or all of the NTP studies with 
dimethoxybenzidine, dimethylbenzidine, or C.I. Direct Blue 15 (NTP, 1991a,b). 
3.5 CI Direct Blue 15 
3.5.1  Oral administration 
At study initiation, 70 F344/N rats of each sex, 40–47 days of age, were given 0 or 
2500 ppm CI Direct Blue 15 [purity , ~50%; ~35 impurities, including 3,3 ′-
dimethoxybenzidine (836–1310 ppm) and benzidine (< 1 ppm)], 45 rats of each sex were given 630 ppm and 75 rats of each sex were given 1250 ppm in the drinking-water. 
Interim evaluations were made at nine and 15 months. The average amounts of compound 
consumed per day by the six dose groups after week 52 of the studies were estimated to 
be 45, 90, and 215 mg/kg for male rats and 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg for female rats. The 
studies were terminated at 22 months due  to extensive mortality associated with 
chemical-related neoplasia. Survival of cont rol, 630-, 1250-, and 2500-ppm males at 22 
months was 37/50, 8/35, 11/65, and 2/50 (see Table 3.2); survival of females was 40/50, 
13/35, 22/65, and 4/50. At 22 months, the mean final body weights of the 630-, 1250-, 
and 2500-ppm groups were 95%, 91%, and 81% of those of the control for male rats and 91% of those of the control for all female dose groups. At the nine-month interim 
evaluations, one adenoma of the Zymbal gland was seen in a high-dose male rat, and 
three carcinomas of the clitoral gland were seen in the high-dose females. At the 15-
month interim evaluations, Zymbal gland ne oplasms were seen in low- and high-dose 
males and in all treated female dose groups. Mid- and high-dose males and females also 
had preputial or clitoral gland neoplasms, and a few neoplasms were present in the skin, small and large intestine, liver, and oral cavi ty of treated animals at 15 months. At the end 
of the study (see Table 3.2), neoplasms related to chemical administration were found in 
the Zymbal gland, skin, oral cav ity, and the preputial or clitoral gland in both male and 
female rats. Neoplasms related to chemical administration were also seen at other sites 
including the small and large intestine, li ver, uterus, and brain. The incidence of 
mononuclear cell leukaemia was also increased in treated rats (NTP, 1992a).

4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distributio n, metabolism and excretion 
4.1.1  Humans 
Lowry et al.  (1980) measured benzidine and monoacetylbenzidine in the urine of 
workers exposed to benzidine- based azo dyes during their ma nufacture, or during textile 
or paper dyeing. A colorimetric screenin g method, based on reaction of extracted 
aromatic amines with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-su lfonic acid, and a specific electron-capture 
gas chromatographic (EC-GC) de tection method were used. Alkali-labile conjugates of 
benzidine and 2,4-diaminoazobenzene were found together with free 2,4-diamino-
azobenzene and traces of benzidine, 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine and 3,3 ′-dimethoxy-
benzidine. 
Dewan et al.  (1988) used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to 
analyse the presence of benzidine and mono- a nd diacetyl-benzidine in post-shift urine 
samples of 18 workers in a small-scale unit ma nufacturing Direct Black 38. Acetylated 284 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 metabolites were found in all of the urine samples (range, 6–131.8 μg/L for monoacetyl-
benzidine), and benzidine was found in all except two (range, 2.4–48.9 μg/L). Two 
workers who lived on the factory premises excr eted very high levels of benzidine (362.5 
and 260.3 μg/L) and its metabolites (1117.2 and 660.2 μg/L, for monoacetylbenzidine) in 
their urine. None of the urine samples s howed the presence of 4-aminobiphenyl. 
Environmental sampling showed high dust levels during powdering of the finished 
product. Exposure to benzidine by inhalati on at this stage was considered unlikely, 
because no benzidine was detectable in the finished dye. 
Beyerbach et al.  (2006) used gas chromatogra phy/mass spectrophotometry (GC/MS) 
to identify and quantify, in groups of Indian workers producing benzidine-2HCl or Direct 
Black 38 from benzidine-2HCl, aniline and other compounds, the following haemoglobin adducts: benzidine-Hb, N-acet ylbenzidine-Hb, 4-aminobip henyl-Hb, aniline-Hb. The 
latter two were quantitatively the major adducts. The amounts of adducts were highly 
correlated in all the exposed workers ( n = 33). The benzidine-exposed group had 10- to 
17-fold higher adduct levels than the dye workers. Since 4-aminobiphenyl can be 
metabolically released from benzidine and the azo dye, and aniline can be released from 
the azo dye, the presence of 4-aminobiphenyl-Hb and aniline-Hb may be the consequence of exposure to the parent compounds, or of exposure to benzidine and the azo dye after 
metabolic release of the arylamine moiety. 
4.1.2  Experimental systems 
(a) In-vivo studies 
Rhesus monkeys excreted an average of 1. 25% benzidine plus monoacetyl-benzidine 
of the benzidine moiety in Direct Black 38, Direct Blue 6, and Direct Brown 95, respectively, in the urine af ter receiving two different doses by gavage, whereas gavage 
with pure benzidine yielded 1.45%. These an alyses were done by use of selective 
extraction followed by thin-l ayer chromatography (TLC). The authors thus postulated a 
nearly complete metabolic conversion of th ese three dyes to benzid ine (Rinde & Troll, 
1975). 
Following oral administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg bw Direct Black 38 to 
Syrian golden hamsters, 10.7 μg benzidine, 535 μg monoacetylbenzidine, 27.6 μg 
diacetylbenzidine, 11.5 μg 4-aminobiphenyl and, as alkali-hydrolysable conjugates, 328.5 
μg benzidine and 6.3 μg 4-aminobiphenyl were identified in the urine by parallel electron-
capture gas chromatography and HPLC. Peak excretion occurred between 0–8 and 8–16 
hours. These results indicate that a total of 10%  of the dye is metabolized to benzidine and 
its metabolic follow-up products (Nony et al. , 1980b). 
Several bisazobiphenyl dyes derived from benzidine, 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine or 3,3 ′-
dimethoxybenzidine were studied in the dog and rat. The dyes were given orally and the 
urine was analysed for benzidine, 3,3 ′-dimethyl- or 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine by use of a 
specific gas chromatographic assa y. The identity of the peak s was confirmed by GC/MS. 
Dogs treated acutely (100 mg/kg bw) with benzidine-derived dyes excreted substantial  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 285  
 quantities of benzidine (166–1675 μg) in urine (0–48 hours). No benzidine was detected 
in urine before treatment. Benzidine present in dog urine following dye administration exceeded by at least ninefold the benzidine present as impurity in the administered dyes, 
and was comparable to that excreted in ur ine when pure benzidine was fed (100 mg/kg 
bw). Rats chronically dosed (100 mg/kg bw /day) with benzidine-based dyes excreted N-
acetylbenzidine (3–54 μg/day) and traces of benzidin e in urine. Bisazobiphenyl dyes 
derived from 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine and 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine were metabolized to 
3,3′-dimethyl- and 3.3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine, respectively , in both the dog and rat. The N-
acetyl derivatives of 3,3 ′-dimethyl- and 3.3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine were identified in urine 
from rats treated with dyes derived from 3.3 ′-dimethyl- and 3.3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine, 
respectively. The results indi cate that the metabolic convers ion of bisazobiphenyl dyes, 
derived from benzidine, 3,3 ′-dimethyl- and 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine, to carcinogenic 
aromatic amines is a general phenomenon, and therefore with few exceptions should be 
anticipated for each member of this class of chemicals (Lynn et al. , 1980). 
The mutagenic activation in vivo  of three azo dyes was studied. Wistar rats received 
solutions of benzidine, Direct Black 38 and Direct Brown 95 orally or by intraperitoneal 
injection. Urine was collected  for 24 hours. For Direct Black 38, significantly higher 
mutagenicity values were found in the urin e after oral administration than after 
intraperitoneal treatment. Such differences we re not observed for benzidine and Direct 
Brown 95. The results suggest that for some compounds like Direct Black 38, extrahepatic enzymes, most likely present in the intestinal flora, play a substantial role in 
the azo cleavage (Bos et al. , 1984). After oral administration of these dyes to germ-free 
Wistar rats, no mutagenicity was observed in the urine. A germ-free rat that received benzidine produced urine with mutagenicity co mparable to that of a normal rat. These 
results show that after oral administration, redu ction by the intestinal microflora is the first 
step in the bio-toxification of  benzidine-based dyes (Bos et al. ,1986). 
(b) In-vitro studies 
Preparations of rat and mouse intestine in vitro  have been shown to convert Direct 
Black 38 to benzidine (Niitsu , 1973). After increasing the microbial activity in rats by 
feeding a meat-based diet, the azo-redu ctase level was also enhanced (Goldin et al.  1978). 
Anaerobic bacterial suspensions isolated fr om human faeces and from the intestinal 
contents of rhesus monkeys and CD rats were incubated for 48 hours with Direct Black 38 (a benzidine-based azo dye), Direct Red 2 (3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine-based), and Direct 
Blue 15 (3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidin e-based). The respective fr ee amines, benzidine, 3,3 ′-
dimethylbenzidine and 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine, formed by  azo reduction of the dyes by 
intestinal bacteria were isolated and identified by GC/MS. Within six hours of incubation, 
90–100% of each dye was reduced by all thre e bacterial suspensions. The results suggest 
that anaerobic intestinal bacteria may play a significant role in the metabolism of dyes derived from benzidine (Cerniglia et al. , 1982a). 
The metabolism of Direct Black 38 (a benz idine-based azo dye) , Direct Red 2 (3,3 ′-
dimethylbenzidine-based) and Direct Blue 15 (3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidin e-based) has been 286 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 studied both in pure cultures  of anaerobic bacteria and in  bacterial suspensions derived 
from the intestinal contents of rats. All of th e pure cultures and the rat intestinal bacteria 
were able to reduce the azo linkages of Direct  Black 38, Direct Red 2 and Direct Blue 15 
with the subsequent formation of benzidine, 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine and 3,3 ′-
dimethoxybenzidine, respectively. The metabolites were isolated and identified by GC/MS, and had chromatographic and mass- spectral properties similar to those of 
authentic standards. In-vitro anaerobic incubations of rat intestinal microorganisms are 
able to reduce and cleave the azo bonds of dyes derived from benzidine, 3,3 ′-
dimethylbenzidine and 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine to fo rm potentially carcinogenic 
aromatic amines (Cerniglia et al. , 1982b). 
Metabolism of the benzidine-based dye Dir ect Black 38 was examined by use of a 
semi-continuous culture system that simulates the lumen of the human large intestine. The 
system was inoculated with freshly void ed human faeces, and an active flora was 
maintained as evidenced by volatile fatty acid and gas production. Within seven days after exposure to the dye, the following metabolites were isolated and identified by GC/MS: 
benzidine, 4-aminobiphenyl, monoacetylben zidine, and acetylamino- biphenyl. Benzidine 
reached its peak level after 24 hours, acco unting for 39.1% of the added dye. Its level 
began to decline, and by day seven the predominant metabolite was acetylaminobiphenyl, 
which accounted for 51.1% of the parent co mpound. Formation of the deaminated and N-
acetylated analogues of benzidine, which are more mutagenic and lipop hilic, has not been 
attributed so far to the intestinal microbiota (Manning et al. , 1985). 
The role of the rat intestinal flora in th e azo reduction of some benzidine-based dyes 
was studied by measurement of the formation of  benzidine after anaerobic incubation of 1 
mM Direct Black 38, Direct Blue 6 and Direct Brown 95 in the presence of caecal 
bacteria in vitro . After about six hours, the concentration of benzidine had reached a 
maximum at 160 μM for Direct Black 38, at 40 μM for Direct Blue 6, and at 30 μM for 
Direct Brown 95 (Bos et al. , 1986). 
The azo reduction and acetylation in vitro  of three azo dyes were studied. In the 
presence of rat-liver S9, benzidine was rel eased from Direct Black 38 and Direct Brown 
95, whereas hardly any benzidine was produced  during incubation of Direct Blue 6. 
Incubation of benzidine with isolated rat hepatocytes resulted in the formation of 
diacetylbenzidine. No diacetylbenzidine was formed during  incubation of benzidine with 
rat-liver S9, unless the cofactor for the acet ylation reaction, acetyl coenzyme A, was 
added to the incubation medium. Isolated rat hepatocytes were capable of producing 
diacetylbenzidine from the three test dyes w ithout supplementation with acetyl coenzyme 
A (Bos et al. , 1984). 
Ingested azo dyes can be metabolized to aromatic amines by intestinal 
microorganisms, but hepatic enzymes can also  catalyse the reductive cleavage of the azo 
linkage to produce the parent amines. The in testinal microbial azoreductase may be more 
important than the liver enzymes in azo reduction. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 
caecal or faecal contents from experimental animals and humans. The significance of the 
capacity of intestinal bacteria  to reduce azo dyes and the conditions of azo reduction were  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 287  
 investigated. The azoreductase( s) that catalyse these reacti ons have been found to be 
oxygen-sensitive and to require flavins for optimal activity. The azo reductase activity in a 
variety of intestinal preparations was influenced by dietary factors such as cellulose, 
proteins, fibres or antibiotics (Chung et al.  1992). 
In a plate assay for the detection of anaerob ic bacteria that produce azoreductases, ten 
strains of anaerobic bacteria capable of re ducing azo dyes were tested. The strains were 
isolated from human faeces and identified as Eubacterium hadrum  (2 strains), 
Eubacterium  spp. (2 species), Clostridium clostridiiforme , a Butyrivibrio  sp., a 
Bacteroides  sp., Clostridium paraputrificum , Clostridium nexile , and a Clostridium  sp. 
The average rate of reduction of Direct Bl ue 15 (a dimethoxybenzidine-based dye) in 
these strains ranged from 16–135 nmol of dye per min per mg of protein. The enzymes 
were inactivated by oxygen. In seven isolat es, a flavin compound  (riboflavin, flavin 
adenine dinucleotide, or flavin  mononucleotide) was required for azoreductase activity. In 
the other three isolates and in Clostridium perfringens , no added flavin was required for 
activity. Each bacterium expressed  only one azoreductase isozyme. At least three types of 
azoreductase were produced by the differen t isolates. All of the azoreductases were 
produced constitutively and released extrace llularly (Rafii et al. , 1990; Rafii & Cerniglia 
1995). 
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
4.2.1  3,3 ′-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride 
3,3′-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  
strain TA98 with exogenous metabolic activation; it was not mutagenic in strains TA100, TA1535, or TA97 with or without activation. 3,3 ′-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride 
induced sister-chromatid exchange and ch romosomal aberration s in Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells in the absence of exogenou s metabolic activation; these effects were 
not evident in tests with S9 activation. Sex- linked recessive lethal mutations were induced 
in germ cells of adult male Drosophila melanogaster  given 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine 
dihydrochloride in the feed or by injection. No reciprocal translocations occurred in D. 
melanogaster  germ cells following exposure to 3,3 ′-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride 
(NTP, 1991a). 
4.2.2  3,3
′-Dimethoxybenzidine dihydrochloride 
3,3′-Dimethoxybenzidine was mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strain TA100 with 
exogenous metabolic activation and in strain TA98 without activation; a weakly positive 
response was observed in strain TA1535 with metabolic activation. 3,3 ′-Dimethoxy-
benzidine induced sister chromatid exchange  and chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells 
with and without exogenous metabolic activation. 3,3 ′-Dimethoxybenzidine did not 288 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 induce sex-linked recessive leth al mutations in adult male D. melanogaster  exposed via 
feeding or by injection (NTP, 1990). 
4.2.3  Direct Black 38 
Direct Black 38 was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100 
when tested in the presence of a mou se-liver metabolic activation system; no 
mutagenicity was observed in the absence of activation (Lazear & Louie 1978). 
Monoacetylbenzidine, a major metabolite of benzidine (see above), and urine from hamsters given Direct Black 38 (100 mg/kg bw) were mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strain 
TA1538, but only when tested in the pre sence of metabolic activation (Lazear & Louie, 
1978; Nony & Bowman 1980a). Urine from rats given 500 mg/kg bw Direct Black 38 was also mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence of 
metabolic activation (Tanaka, 1980). 
4.2.4  CI Acid Red 114 
In a standard pre-incubation protocol, CI Acid Red 114 was mutagenic in Salmonella 
typhimurium  strain TA98 in the presence of indu ced hamster liver S9 , and an equivocal 
response was noted in strain TA100 with hamster liver S9. However, no significant 
mutagenic activity was noted in strains TA1535 or TA1537, with or without S9 
activation. In a modified S. typhimurium  gene-mutation test that employed reductive 
metabolism followed by oxidative metabolism with S9 liver enzymes, CI Acid Red 114 
was strongly mutagenic in st rain TA1538. This dye did not induce sister chromatid 
exchange or chromosomal aber rations in CHO cells with or without S9 activation; 
reductive metabolism was not used in these cy togenetic tests. No increase in sex-linked 
recessive lethal mutations was observed in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster  
administered CI Acid Red 114 by feeding or injection (NTP, 1991b). 
4.2.5  CI Direct Blue 15 
CI Direct Blue 15 was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA100, 
TA1535, TA1537, and TA98 when tested in a standard pre-incubation protocol with or 
without exogenous metabolic activation; however, when a specialized reductive 
metabolism protocol was used, C.I. Direct Blue demonstrated mutagenic activity in Salmonella  strain TA1538. C.I. Direct Blue 15 did not induce sister chromatid exchange 
or chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells with or without S9 activation; reductive 
metabolism was not used in these cytogenetic tests (NTP, 1992a). 
4.2.6  CI Direct Blue 218 
CI Direct Blue 218 was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA98, 
TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 t ested with and without exogenous metabolic activation  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 289  
 (S9). It was also tested in a modified Salmonella  test-protocol that employed reductive 
metabolism supplied by flav in mononucleotide or rat caecal  bacteria, followed by 
oxidative metabolism; results of this test w ith strain TA1538 were  also negative. C.I. 
Direct Blue 218 induced a small but significant  increase in sister chromatid exchange in 
CHO cells at the highest dose tested, withou t S9. No increase in ch romosomal aberrations 
was observed in these cells, with or without S9 . C.I. Direct Blue 2 18 did not induce sex-
linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster  (NTP, 
1994). 
4.2.7  CI Pigment Red 23 
CI Pigment Red 23, an azo dye, was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  strains 
TA100, TA1537, and TA98, with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9), but it 
was not mutagenic in strain TA1535. CI Pigment Red 23 induced sister chromatid 
exchange in CHO cells in the absence of S9, but not with S9 activation. The pigment did 
not induce chromosomal aberrati ons in these cells in the pr esence or absence of S9 (NTP, 
1992b). 
4.3 Mechanistic considerations 
This section discusses the general problem of  how to approach the hazard evaluation 
of precursors of established carcinogens, e.g., azo-colourants. These are synthesized by 
coupling aryl amines with single or multipl e diazo moieties. Benzid ine and the benzidine 
derivatives 3,3 ′-dimethyl-, 3,3 ′-dimethoxy-, and 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine are compounds 
that can be double-diazotized. The azo grou p can be cleaved reductively by intestinal 
bacteria or azo reductases in the liver an d in other tissues, and the amines released. 
Aminonaphthalene and monocyclic aromatic amines are also encountered. In many cases 
the released amines or their metabolites have be en detected in experimental animals as 
well as in humans. Most of these basic components are carcinogenic in experimental animals, benzidine itself being an IARC Gr oup-1 carcinogen. Hundreds of such azo 
colourants exist, and they obviously cannot be all tested individually for carcinogenic 
potential. 
As an example, Direct Red 28 was orally administered to rats and the haemoglobin 
adducts were used as biomarkers to demonstrat e that benzidine is released from the dye. 
The same haemoglobin adducts were found with  benzidine itself. Upon hydrolysis of the 
haemoglobin adduct benzidine, monoacetylbenzidine and 4-aminobiphenyl were 
identified in the same relative amounts (Birner et al. , 1990). This shows that the dye is 
metabolized to benzidine, and one of its two amino groups is N-oxidized to the nitroso-
derivative that binds to haemoglobin in th e erythrocytes. A radical-based mechanism may 
also play a role. It shows also that the reac tive metabolite is widely distributed and can be 
expected to produce DNA lesions in most tissues. It should be noted that 4-amino-
biphenyl is a metabolite of the dye and of benzidine, which links this exposure to that of 290 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 nitrobiphenyl, a combustion product and common environmental pollutant (Neumann, 
2001). 
Similarly, benzidine and 4-aminobipheny l are released from Direct Black 38 and 
Direct Brown 1, commonly used in leather and textile industries. The particular role of 
skin bacteria for reductive cleavage and th e subsequent absorptio n of the amines from 
textiles is emphasized (Gnanamani et al. , 2004). 
It is concluded that all azo colourants whose metabolism can li berate a carcinogenic 
aromatic amine are potentially carcinogenic. It  has therefore been recommended that the 
colourants be dealt with as if they were  classified in the same categories as the 
corresponding carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic amine (Deutsche Forschungs-
gemeinschaft, 2007). There ar e, however, colourants that have been claimed to be 
insoluble and that may not contribute to the amine exposure. This can be tested by use of 
biomarkers. In case of Pigment Yellow 17, a diarylide azo pigment with a 3,3 ′-
dichlorobenzidine component, the expected h aemoglobin adducts were identified after 
intratracheal instillation and oral administration  to rats, but the level was very low. In a 4-
week feeding study, Zwirner-Baier & Neuma nn (1994) calculated that 0.6% of the dose 
was cleaved in the intestine and the 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine absorbed. Others have 
suggested that the amine component of 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine-based dyes is in general 
practically not bioavailable (Golka et al. , 2004).] 
When the contribution of a benzidine-based dye to cancer risk is claimed to be low or 
negligible, the bio-availability of the carcinogenic component should be excluded, e.g. by 
use of biomarkers of exposure or biomarkers of  effect. However, if th is is not the case, it 
does not seem justified to classify benzidin e-based dyes differently from benzidine. 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
See the Monograph on Benzidine in this volume. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
The epidemiological evidence has been revi ewed for workers exposed to benzidine 
derivatives (3,3 ′-dimethyl-, 3,3 ′-dimethoxy-, and 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine) and benzidine-
based dyes. Studies of occupations with po tential exposure to dyes metabolized to 
benzidine were reviewed only in those inst ances in which the auth ors specifically noted 
that such an exposure was o ccurring, including shoe and leather workers, and textile 
workers. 
Consistently elevated risks for bladder cancer were observed among workers exposed 
to benzidine derivatives. There is also some evidence of increased ri sks with intensity of 
exposure and duration of exposure.  DYES METABOLIZED TO BENZIDINE 291  
 The Working Group identified four cohort  studies and two case–control studies in 
populations occupationally exposed to dyes metabolized to benzidine. The risk for 
bladder cancer for workers exposed to dyes me tabolized to benzidine was not consistent 
across studies, with some reports showing ex cess risk and others not showing an effect. A 
limitation of most studies is that while they indicate the potential for exposure to these compounds, no quantitative ex posure data are presented. 
The difficulty of evaluating the cancer risk  from exposure to these compounds arises 
from concomitant exposures to benzidine and 2-naphthylamine, which are bladder carcinogens in humans. Potential cross-contam ination with residual benzidine may also 
occur. Consequently, it is not possible to establish if the ri sks observed in certain studies 
are due to potential confounders or to benzidine precursors of dyes metabolized to benzidine. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
Direct Black 38 was tested  for carcinogenicity in mi ce by oral administration, 
producing hepatocellular carcinomas and mammary  carcinomas. In rats, Direct Black 38 
produced hepatocellular carcino mas within 13 weeks after ad ministration in the diet, and 
carcinomas in the urinary bladder, liver and colon after administration in drinking-water. 
In a single well-conducted study, Direct Blue 6 produced hepa tocellular carcinomas 
in male and female rats within 13 weeks after its oral administration. 
Direct Brown 95 was tested for carcinog enicity in a single well-conducted study 
under Good Laboratory Practice. After oral administration, it produ ced neoplastic nodules 
in the livers of 4/8 female rats, one of which showed a hepatocellular carcinoma. This 
study was terminated after 13 weeks. The fi nding of preneoplastic lesions after such a 
short exposure period suggests a carcinogenic eff ect similar to that of Direct Black 38 and 
Direct Blue 6. 
C.I. Acid Red 114 was tested for carcinogen icity in rats by administration in the 
drinking-water. It produced a clear carcinoge nic response in the skin, Zymbal gland and 
liver of male and female rats, and in the clit oral gland, oral cavit y epithelium, small and 
large intestine, and lung in female rats after two years. Treatment-related increases were 
also seen in the incidences of neoplasms of th e oral cavity epithelium, adrenal gland, and 
lung of male rats, and of mononuclear ce ll leukaemia and neoplasms of the mammary 
gland and adrenal gland in female rats. 
C.I. Direct Blue 15 was tested for carcinoge nicity in rats by administration in the 
drinking-water. It produced ne oplasms in the Zymbal gland,  skin, oral cavity, and the 
preputial or clitoral gland in both male  and female rats. The 24-month study was 
terminated at 22 months because of rapidl y declining animal survival, which was due 
primarily to neoplasia. Neoplasms related to chemical administration were also seen at 
other sites including the small and large intestine, liver, uterus, and brain. 
C.I. Direct Blue 218 was tested for carcin ogenicity in mice and rats by administration 
in the diet. It produced hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in male and female mice, 292 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 and squamous cell papillomas or carcinomas of the pharynx in male rats after two years 
of treatment.

6. Evaluation 
6.1 Cancer in humans 
There is inadequate evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of dyes metabolized 
to benzidine. 
6.2 Cancer in experimental animals 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of Direct 
Black 38. 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of Direct 
Blue 6. 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of Direct 
Brown 95. 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
Dyes metabolized to benzidine are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)  
 In reaching this evaluati on, the Working Group cons idered the following: 
(1) Benzidine is a Group-1 human carcinogen, (2) metabolism of benzidine-based 
dyes results in the release of free benzidine in humans and in all experimental animal 
species studied, and (3) exposure  to benzidine from exposure  to benzidine-based dyes is 
equivalent to exposure to  large doses of benzidine.

–297– MAGENTA AND MAGE NTA PRODUCTION 
Historically, the name Magenta has been used to refer to th e mixture of the four major 
constituents comprising Basic Fuchsin, namely Basic Red 9 (Magenta 0), Magenta I 
(Rosaniline), Magenta II, and Magenta III (New fuchsin). Although samples of Basic 
Fuchsin can vary considerably in the proportions of these four  constituents, today each of 
these compounds except Magenta II is avai lable commercially under its own name. 
Magenta I and Basic Red 9 are the most widely available.

1.1.5  Analysis 
The first reports on analysis of magenta were published during the 1960s. The more 
recent studies have involved the use of LC /MS, in which laser-d esorption electrospray 
ionization was employed to analyse paper and textiles for the presence of magenta. 
Assessments using high-resolu tion TLC, including an el ectromolecular propulsion 
method, have been reported (Table 1.1). 
An LC-MS method involving electrospray ionization has been developed to 
distinguish Magenta 0 from its homologues, wh ich have identical UV-visible absorption 
spectra (Huang et al. , 2005). 
1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
Magenta was among the first synthetic dyes to be produced, beginning in the 1850s 
(Bannister & Elliot, 1983). Magenta was produc ed commercially in England (Bannister & 
Olin, 1965) and in the USA (US Tariff Commi ssion, 1922). In the United Kingdom, the 
process for manufacturing magenta has involved condensation of ortho -toluidine (see H2NN H 2NH HCl302 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 IARC, 1982a, 1987) and form aldehyde (see IARC, 1982b, 1987) in the presence of 
nitrotoluene, resulting mainly in the productio n of Magenta III (Howe, 1977). Magenta I 
is prepared by the reaction of a mixtur e of aniline (see IARC, 1982a, 1987), ortho - and 
para-toluidine and their hydrochlorides with nitrobenzene or a mixture of nitrobenzene 
and ortho -nitrotoluene in the presence of ferrous chloride, ferrous oxide and zinc chloride 
(US National Library of Medicine, 1992). C.I. Basic Red 9 is prepared by the reaction of 
aniline with formaldehyde in the presen ce of hydrogen chloride, forming 4,4’-
methylenedianiline (see IARC, 1986), which is  then heated with aniline and aniline 
hydrochloride in the presence of nitrobenzene and ferric chlori de (US National Library of 
Medicine, 1992).

Magenta III is prepared by condensation of two moles of ortho- toluidine with 
formaldehyde in nitrobenzene in the presen ce of iron salts to give the corresponding 
substituted diphenylmethane b ase. This base is not isolated , but undergoes an oxidative 
condensation with another mole of ortho -toluidine to produce the dye (Thetford, 2000). 
No recent data were available on the prod uction of magenta or C.I. Basic Red 9. 
Production data for Magenta I in the USA were last reported for 1964, when the 
combined production of five producers was reported as 53 tonnes (US Tariff Commission, 1965). Production of C.I. Basi c Red 9 in the USA was estimated as greater 
than 0.9 tonnes in 1972 and 0.5 tonnes in 1975 (US National Library of Medicine, 1992). 
The USEPA (2003, 2007) Inventory Update Rule regulation requires manufacturers 
and importers of certain chemical substances listed in the TSCA Chemical Substance 
Inventory to report manufacturing inform ation (aggregate production volumes) for  MAGENTA AND MAGENTA PRODUCTION 303  
 chemicals manufactured (including imported) in amounts of 10 000 pounds [4500 kg] or 
greater (in 1986) or 25 000 pounds [11 000 kg] or greater (in 2003) at a single site. The aggregate production volume reported for Magenta I in 1990 was 10 000-500 000 pounds 
[4500–227 000 kg]. 
Available information indicates that Magenta I was produced and/or supplied in 
research quantities in the following countries: Canada , Germany, Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, India, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the 
USA (Chemical Sources International, 2008). 
Magenta III was produced and/or supplied in research quantities in the following 
countries: Canada, Germany, India, Japan , Switzerland, and the USA (Chemical Sources 
International, 2008). 
Magenta 0 was produced and/or supplied in research quantiti es in the following 
countries: Germany, Hong Ko ng Special Administrative Region, India, Japan, the 
Netherlands, Switzerland, and the USA (C hemical Sources Intern ational, 2008). 
1.2.2  Use 
The general population can be exposed to magenta through a variety of uses. Under 
the name of Basic Violet 14, magenta is used in hair dyes and is also used in cosmetic 
products not intended to come in cont act with mucous membranes (EU Directive 
76/768/EEC). Magenta stains animal fibres di rectly and vegetable fibres after mordanting. 
Under the name of Basic Red 9, magenta is al so used as a colourant in artists’ paints. 
Magenta III is used as a thin-layer chromatogr aphy developing agent for perfluorinated 
organics (Williams et al. , 1992). 
Magenta is antiseptic against gram-positive bacteria and can be used in dermatology 
for the treatment of pyoderma, dermatitis, intertrigo, eczema, and burns in solutions of 2% 
to 5% (Balabanova et al. , 2003). Known as Castellani’s paint or magenta paint, it has 
been used topically since it was introduced in the 1920s (Castellani, 1968) to treat skin 
conditions such as fungal skin lesions (Whitwell, 1968) or infective dermatitis (Shelley, 
2004). Carbol-Fuchsin solution , containing less than 1% of CI Basic Red 9, is used to 
treat postoperative phenol nail procedures and as a dermal first-aid antiseptic drying agent 
(Biogenex, 2003). 
Magenta is reported to be used as a food-i rradiation dosimeter in an aqueous solution 
of 3.13 ×10
-5 mol/L (Khan & Naz, 2007) and as a m eat-marking colour in New Zealand 
(Dacre, 1971). 
1.3 Occurrence 
1.3.1  Natural occurrence 
Magenta is not known to occur as a natural product. 304 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
The only well-described groups of worker s exposed to magenta include those in a 
dyestuffs-manufacturing plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany (Rehn, 1895), the manufacture 
of magenta in the British chemical indust ry (1910–1952) (Case & Pe arson, 1954) and the 
manufacture of “new fuchsin” in an  Italian dyestuffs factory (Rubino et al. , 1982; Piolatto 
et al. , 1991). No environmental or  biological measurements have been reported for these 
plants or any other plants that have produced or are currently producing magenta. 
Production of magenta may expose workers to process chemicals (e.g., aniline, ortho - 
and para-toluidine, and – historically – arsenic acid). Exposure to other chemicals used 
and produced at the same location may also oc cur (e.g., benzidine, 1-naphthylamine, 
2-naphthylamine, auramine, aniline) (Case & Pearson, 1954). 
Occupational exposure can also occur during  the use of magenta as a dye intermediate 
and when dyeing textile fibres, fabrics and paper products (IARC, 1993). The levels of exposure to magenta have not been reported for these occupational groups. 
Exposure to magenta can also occur in labo ratories, where it is widely used as a 
biological stain (basic fuchsin dye) to stain bacteria and as a component of Schiff’s reagent to detect aldehydes. Under laboratory conditions, magenta has also been produced 
directly on nylon fabric by a fungal strain closely related to Phoma herbarum  (Chiba 
et al. , 2006). 
The US National Exposure Survey (1981–198 3) estimates the number of employees 
potentially exposed to Basic Red 9 as approximately 900, the largest group being 
laboratory technicians and medical scientists . A total of around 12 700 workers were 
potentially exposed to Magenta I in six industries (NIOSH, 1990). 
1.3.3  Exposure of the general population 
Magenta may be present in the waste effluents from plants where it is produced or 
used. Concentrations of magenta in water or soil have not been reported. Wastewater 
containing dyes from the textile i ndustry is difficult to treat using conventional methods, 
because the dyes are stable to light and oxid izing agents, and are resistant to aerobic 
digestion (Rai et al. , 2007). Various methods for the degradation of magenta in 
wastewater have been developed (Li et al. , 1999; Yiyun & Jiepin, 2005).

2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
2.1 Case report 
Rehn (1895) was the first to report the a ppearance of bladder tumours in three of 
45 workers involved in the manufacture of fuchsin in one factory in Germany. At the time, this process involved heat ing a mixture of chemicals, including toluid ine, aniline 306 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 and nitrobenzene to obtain crude fuchsin, wh ich was then purified and crystallized. The 
three workers had been employed for 15–29 years. One worker developed a “fibroma papillare”, another an oedemat ous papilloma, and the third a carcinoma of the bladder.  
2.2 Cohort studies 
Case & Pearson (1954) surveyed workers empl oyed for at least six months between 
1910 and 1952 in the manufacture of magent a in the British chemical industry. Workers 
who had been exposed to benzidine or 1- or 2-naphthylamine were excluded. Bladder-
cancer occurrence was determined from fact ory and hospital records. Deaths were 
identified from alphabetical lists of death certificates, and the nu mbers were compared 
with mortality rates for England and Wales for the period 1921–1952. Among 
85 magenta production workers known to have been in contact with magenta, but not exposed to auramine, 1- or 2-naphthylamine or  benzidine, there were five cases of bladder 
cancer, with exposure duration ranging from 1–19 years. Three of these cases were 
mentioned on death certificates, whereas only  0.13 would have been expected for the 
whole male population in England and Wales (SMR 23.1; P < 0.005). One case of 
bladder cancer was observed among nine subjects who had been exposed to both magenta 
and auramine, but no death was seen from th is cause (0.02 expected). [The Working 
Group noted that during the manufacture of magenta exposure to other aromatic amines 
cannot be ruled out.] 
Rubino et al.  (1982) studied case-specific mortality of 53 male workers who had been 
employed for ≥ 1 month in the manufacture of ‘new fuchsin’ (Magenta III, Basic Violet 2, 
CI No. 42520) and Safranine T (Basic Red 2, CI No. 50240) during the period 1922–1970 
in a factory in the province of Torino, Italy. Workers engaged in the manufacture and use of 1- or 2-naphthylamine or benzidine were excluded from the study. Subjects and their 
work histories were identified from factor y personnel records, and the workers were 
followed for mortality from 1946 to 1976, as identified from factory records and from the 
municipal registries of their current residence. Among the 53 workers exposed, five 
deaths from bladder cancer were observed, while 0.08 were expected on the basis of 
mortality rates for Italy in 1951–76 (SMR 62.5; P < 0.001). The cases had been 
occupationally exposed to Magenta III and Safranine T for 12–40 years. The exposures 
also involved ortho -toluidine and 4,4'-methylenebis(2- methylaniline). The same cohort of 
workers was followed to the end of 1981 (Decarli et al. , 1985) and further until 1989 
(Piolatto et al. , 1991). No additional deaths from bladder cancer were reported. 
2.3 Case–control studies 
A total of 512 male cases of bladder can cer and 596 hospital-based controls were 
studied for occupation and bladder-cancer risk during 1978–1983 in the province of 
Torino, Italy (Vineis & Magnani, 1985). Complete occupational histories and related 
information were obtained via hospital in terviews. Exposures to specific chemicals,  MAGENTA AND MAGENTA PRODUCTION 307  
 including magenta, were estimated from IL O occupation and industry titles, using 
information on the industrial  uses of these chemicals as d escribed in published sources. 
On the basis of industrial branches in which magenta exposure could have occurred, 
41 cases were classified as having been exposed before the age of 60, to give a relative 
risk of 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.9). On the basis of job titles in which exposure 
to magenta could have occurred, two cases were  classified as having been exposed before 
the age of 60, with an associated relative risk  of 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.4–20.0). 
3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
3.1 Magenta 
3.1.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse 
A group of sixty stock mice (30 males, 30 females; strain and age unspecified) 
received 12 mg magenta (BDH; purity not speci fied) in arachis oil by gastric instillation 
once per week for 52 weeks (total dose, 624 mg), and were kept for their life-span. 
Eighteen mice were used as controls. Four (20%) lymphomas and one (5%) hepatoma were found in 20 surviving treated animals,  and five (25%) lymphomas were found in 
18 controls (Bonser et al.  1956). 
(b) Rat 
A group of eighty Sprague Dawley rats (40 ma les, 40 females), 12 weeks of age, were 
treated by intragastric instillation with mage nta (purity unspecified) dissolved in saline, 
twice weekly for life. Initial dose was 400 mg/kg bw per week, but due to severe toxicity the treatment had to be interrupted and continued at half the original dose level. A control 
group of similar size received the solvent only . Tumour incidences reported were 5% for 
the magenta-treated rats and 40% for the co ntrols (males and females combined) (Ketkar 
& Mohr 1982). 
(c) Hamster  
Syrian golden hamsters (40 males, 40 fema les), 12 weeks of age, were treated by 
intragastric instillation with magenta dissolved in saline, twice weekly for life. Dose 
levels were 400 and 600 mg/kg bw. The 600-mg/kg bw dose was not tolerated by the 
animals. A control group was given the solven t only. Tumour incide nces reported at the 
low dose were 5% (one nasal cavity fibroma and a bronchiogenic adenoma in two male 
hamsters; one adrenal cortex adenoma and one submandibular gland adenoma in two 
females), and 10% for the solvent controls (e xcept for one adrenal cortex adenoma, all 308 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 nine other tumours in eight control animals – three males, five females – were seen at 
sites different from those in the treated hamsters) (Green et al. , 1979). 
3.2 CI Basic Red 9 ( para -magenta) 
3.2.1  Oral administration 
(a) Mouse  
Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F 1 mice, 6–10 weeks of age, were given a diet 
containing 0, 500 or 1000 mg/kg (ppm) CI Basic Red 9 for 103 weeks and were killed at 
110–115 weeks of age. Two lots of the test chemical were used, with purities of 93 and 
99% (water was the major impurity). Mean body  weights of treated mice were lower than 
those of controls throughout the study. At the end of the experiment, 42/50 (84%) control; 
32/50 (64%) low-dose; 35/50 (70%) high-dose males and 31/50 (62%) control, 12/50 (24%) low-dose, and 6/50 (12%) high-dose females were alive ( P < 0.001). In male mice, 
CI Basic Red 9 caused a dose-related incr ease in the incidence of hepatocellular 
carcinomas (10/50 (20%) control; 20/50 (40%) low-dose; 27/50 (54%) high-dose; P < 0.001, incidental tumour trend test). The incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was 
22/50 (44%) control, 21/50 (42%) low-dose, and 17/50 (34%) high-dose. The combined 
incidence of liver tumours was 29/50 (58%) control, 37/50 (74%) low-dose, and 41/50 (82%) high-dose ( P = 0.005, incidental tumour trend t est). In female mice, the compound 
caused a dose-related increase in the inciden ce of hepatocellular carcinomas (3/49 (6.1%) 
control; 19/50 (38%) low-dose; 37/49 (75%) high-dose; P < 0.001, Cochran-Armitage 
trend test). The incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was 2/49 (4%) control, 18/50 (36%) 
low-dose and 4/49 (8%) high-dose ( P < 0.001, Fischer exact test). The combined 
incidence of liver tumours in females was 5/49 (10%) control, 35/50 (70%) low-dose, and 41/49 (84%) high-dose ( P < 0.001, Cochran-Armitage tren d test). An increase in the 
incidence of benign and malignant adrenal phaeochromocytomas (combined) was found 
in females (1/48 (2%) control; 8/47 (17%) low-dose; 8/45 (18%) high-dose; P = 0.015, 
Cochran-Armitage trend test) (NTP, 1986). 
(b) Rat 
Groups of 40 male and 40 female Sprague Da wley rats, 12 weeks of age, were treated 
intragastrically twice a week with 0 or 600 mg/kg bw CI Basic Red 9 [purity unspecified] 
in 0.9% saline. The dose of 600 mg/kg was found to be toxic and, after 12 weeks, 
treatment was discontinued for one week; after a further six weeks, half of the original 
dose (300 mg/kg bw) was used for the remaini ng treatment, for life. Average survival 
times were 104 weeks for control males, 70 weeks for treated males, 92 weeks for control 
females and 69 weeks for treated females. No  treatment-related increase in the incidence 
of tumours was observed in rats of either sex (Ketkar & Mohr, 1982). [The Working 
Group noted the poor survival in the treated groups and the inadequate reporting of the 
study.]  MAGENTA AND MAGENTA PRODUCTION 309  
 Groups of 50 male and 50 female Fischer 344/N rats, 6–7 weeks of age, were given a 
diet containing 0, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg (ppm ) (males) and 0, 500 or 1000 ppm (females) 
CI Basic Red 9 for 103 weeks and were killed at 110–113 weeks of age. Two lots of the 
test chemical were used, with purities of  93 and 99% (water was the major impurity). 
Increased mortality was seen in  high-dose males and femal es, and at the end of the 
experiment, 36/50 (72%) control, 29/50 (58%) low-dose and 0/50 high-dose males and 
37/50 (74%) control, 35/50 (70%) low-dose,  and 14/50 (28%) high-dose females were 
still alive. CI Basic Red 9 caused significan t increases in the incidences of benign and 
malignant tumours at various sites in both males and females (Table 3.1) (NTP, 1986).

 (c) Hamster  
Syrian golden hamsters (40 males, 40 fema les), 12 weeks of age, were treated by 
intragastric instillation with CI Basic Red 9 dissolved in saline, twice weekly for life. Dose levels were 300 and 600 mg/kg bw. The high dose was not tolerated by the animals. 
Tumour incidences reported at  the low dose were 6% (one adrenal cortex adenoma, one 
tracheal papillary polyp and two intestinal ad enocarcinomas, all in one male hamster; one 
tracheal papillary polyp, on e subcutaneous fibrosarcoma and two intestinal adeno-
carcinomas in four females), and 10% for th e solvent controls (except for one adrenal 
cortex adenoma, all nine other tumours in eight control animals – three males, five 
females – were seen at sites different from  those in the treated hamsters) (Green et al. , 
1979). 
3.2.2  Subcutaneous administration 
(a) Rat 
Twenty BD III rats received 10 mg para-magenta as a 1% aqueous solution by 
subcutaneous injection once per week for 65 weeks (total dose, 650 mg). The first local 
sarcoma appeared at 10 months (total dose, 370 mg); six more were observed in 
subsequent months in 12 surviving animals.  The spontaneous incidence of sarcomas in 
these rats was < 0.5% (Druckrey et al.  1956). [The Working Group noted the lack of use 
of controls and the lack of adequate description of the experiment.] 
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination 
No data were available to the Working Group. 
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
4.2.1  Magenta (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2)  
[The data reported in the Table are the results of experiments with commercial 
preparations of magenta; in most cases, the ex act composition of the products tested and 
the degree of purity is not known. In the experiments with Magenta I the test compound seems to be better identified, but also in this  case its degree of purity  is not reported.] 
Magenta came out negative in the prophage-induction test, both in the absence and 
the presence of metabolic activation (Speck et al. , 1978). It was mutagenic in Salmonella 
typhimurium  strains TA98, TA100, and TA1535, bu t only in the presence of metabolic 
activation. The effect was observed with TA98 (Mortelmans et al. , 1986), TA100   MAGENTA AND MAGENTA PRODUCTION 311

 (Dunkel et al. , 1984; Mortelmans et al. , 1986; Yamaguchi, 1988), and TA1535 
(Mortelmans et al. , 1986). Magenta was negative with TA1537 (Dunkel et al. , 1984; 
Mortelmans et al. , 1986; JETOC, 1996), TA98 and TA100 (JETOC, 1996) and TA1538 
(Rosenkranz and Poirier, 1979; Dunkel et al. , 1984; JETOC, 1996). In both the absence 
and the presence of metabolic activation , it did not induce reverse mutations in 
Escherichia coli  (Dunkel et al. , 1984; JETOC, 1996) or homozygosis with 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (Simmon, 1979b). In cultured, non-human mammalian cells, 
magenta did not induce unscheduled DNA synth esis in primary rat hepatocytes (Williams 
et al. , 1982) and, tested only in the absence of metabolic activation, failed to induce 
morphological transformation in Syrian hamster embryo cells (Pienta et al. , 1977). 
Mutagenic activity of Magenta I in bacteria w as similar to that of magenta; it showed a 
positive result, but only in the presence of metabolic activation, in Salmonella 
typhimurium  TA98 and TA100, and gave a negative response in TA1535 and TA1537 
(Mortelmans et al. , 1986). 
These data indicate that in the presence of an  exogenous system of activation, both 
magenta and Magenta I are mutagenic in bacteria. 
4.2.2  CI Basic Red 9 ( para-rosaniline) (see Table 4.2)  
[In the large majority of the studies reporte d in the Table, information on the degree 
of purity of CI Direct Red 9, a common constituent of magenta, is lacking; commercial products were used.] 
In the absence of metabolic activation, CI Basic Red 9 came out negative in the 
prophage-induction test (Speck et al. , 1978), but induced repairable DNA damage in two 
E. coli  differential toxicity assays (Ros enkranz & Poirier, 1979; De Flora et al. , 1984a). It 
was more often non-mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  (Simmon 1979a; Bonin et al. , 
1981; De Flora, 1981). A positive respon se was obtained only in the presence of 
metabolic activation with TA98 (Dunkel et al. , 1984; Arni et al. , 1985; Mortelmans et al. , 
1986), with TA100 (Dunkel et al. , 1984; Mortelmans et al. , 1986), with TA1535 
(Mortelmans et al. , 1986), with TA1538 (Bonin et al. , 1981), and with TA97 (De Flora et 
al., 1984b). The response was negative with TA1537 (Mortelmans et al. , 1986), with 
TA102 (De Flora et al. , 1984b) and TA1586 (Simmon, 1979a). CI Basic Red 9 induced 
forward mutation in Escherichia coli  in both the absence and the presence of metabolic 
activation, but not reverse mutation (Hayes et al.
, 1984). In a study with Saccharomyces 
cereviasiae , CI Basic Red 9 did not induce homozygosis by mitotic recombination 
(Simmon, 1979b). 
In cultured, non-human mammalian cells, both positive and negative results were 
obtained. CI Basic Red 9 induced unsched uled DNA synthesis in Syrian hamster 
hepatocytes (Kornbrust & Barfknecht, 1984) and in one study with rat primary hepatocytes (NTP, 1986) and was negative in two other studies in rats (Williams et al. , 
1982; Kornbrust & Barfknecht, 1984).  Mutation at the thymidine kinase ( Tk) locus in 
mouse lymphoma cells was induced in both  the absence and the presence of metabolic 318 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 activation in only one of two studies (Mitchell et al. , 1988), and a negative result was 
obtained in a different gene-mutation assay (Myhr & Caspary, 1988; Yamada et al. , 
2000). Similarly, chromosomal aberration s were induced in one study (Hagiwara et al. , 
2006), but not in two others (Anderson et al. , 1990; Yamada et al. , 2000), and sister 
chromatid exchange was not observed (Anderson et al. , 1990). Variable responses were 
obtained in four assays for cell transformation: two positive (Dunkel et al. , 1981) and two 
negative (Pienta et al. , 1977; Pienta & Kawalek, 1981) r esults in the absence of metabolic 
activation, and one positive result in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system (Pienta & Kawalek, 1981). Oral administration of CI Basic Red 9 to mice or rats resulted 
in urine that was mutagenic to bacteria (Lawlor et al. , 1987), but in a host-mediated assay 
the dye did not induce mutation in Salmonella typhimurium  recovered from the peritoneal 
cavity of mice (Simmon et al. , 1979). 
The inconsistency in the genotoxicity data could be attributed to the different grades 
of purity of the material employed. 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
Historically, the name magenta has been used to refer to a mixture of the four major 
constituents comprising Basic Fuchsin, name ly Basic Red 9, Magenta I, Magenta II and 
Magenta III. Today all except Magenta II ar e available commercially under their own 
names. Magenta I and Basic Red 9 are the most widely available. 
Magenta has not been reported to occur as su ch in nature. Under the name of Basic 
Violet 14 (Magenta I), magenta is used in ha ir dyes and in cosmetic products not intended 
to come in contact with mucous membranes. Basic Red 9 is used as colourant in artist’s 
paints. 
Magenta has antiseptic properties; it has b een used in dermatology since the 1920s 
under the name of Castellani’s paint or magenta paint. Carbol-Fuchsin solution, which 
contains Basic Red 9, is used topically as a first-aid antiseptic drying agent. It is also 
widely used in laboratories as a biological stain. 
Magenta is used as a food-irradiation do simeter and was used as a meat-marking 
colour in New Zealand. 
Occupational exposure to magenta can occur during its production, during its use as a 
dye intermediate, when dyeing textile fibres, fabrics and paper products, and in 
laboratories. 
Production of magenta may involve exposu re to process chemicals such as aniline, 
ortho - and para-toluidine, and – historically – arsenic acid. Exposure to other chemicals 
used and produced at the same location may also occur (e.g., benzidine, 1-naphthylamine, 2-naphthylamine, auramine, aniline).  MAGENTA AND MAGENTA PRODUCTION 319  
 Magenta may be present in the waste effluents from plants where it is produced or 
used. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
One case report from German y and two small cohort studies from the United 
Kingdom and Italy have reported an increased risk for bladder cancer among workers engaged in the manufacture of magenta. These cohort studies excluded workers exposed 
to benzidine and β-naphthylamine. One case–control st udy from Italy has shown an 
increased risk for bladder cancer associated with occupational exposure to magenta. 
Taken together, these studies indicate that excess bladder cancer risks are caused by the 
production of magenta, but co-exposures preclude a similar evaluation for magenta itself. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
No adequate study was available to evaluate the carcinogenicity of magenta in 
experimental animals. 
CI Basic Red 9 (Magenta 0) was tested fo r carcinogenicity in one study in mice and 
in one study in rats by oral  administration in the diet, an d in one study in rats by 
subcutaneous administration. After oral administration, the compound induced 
hepatocellular carcinomas in male and female mice and in male rats; adrenal gland phaeochromocytomas in female mice; benign and malignant skin tumours in male rats; 
and subcutaneous fibromas, thyroid gland follicular-cell tumours, and Zymbal gland 
carcinomas in male and female rats. Subcutaneous  administration to rats resulted in a high 
incidence of local sarcomas. A study in hams ters was found inadequate for evaluation. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
There are no data on the toxicokinetic s of magenta or CI Basic Red 9. 
Few data are available on the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of magenta and Magenta 
I. Both were mutagenic in S. typhimurium  TA100 and TA 98 (magenta in two out of four 
experiments) in the presence of an exogenous  metabolic activation system, but they were 
inactive in all other strains tested. Magenta did not induce homozygosis in S. cerevisiae , 
unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in primary hepatocytes or cell transformation of SHE 
cells. 
The data for CI Basic Red 9 are also inco nsistent. In the mutagenicity tests in 
Salmonella , it was always negative in the absence of  an exogenous system of activation, 
while in the presence of bioact ivation, the results were clearly positive only in strain 
TA100 (two out of three experiments). Sim ilar conflicting results were obtained in 
different tests in E. coli . 
In mammalian cells in vitro , CI Basic Red 9 was positive for UDS induction in one of 
three experiments in rat hepatocytes and in  one study with hamster hepatocytes. In a 320 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 recent test for chromosomal aberrations in Syrian hams ter embryo cells, the compound 
was positive, in the absence of activation, at  a very low dose (0.29 microg/mL), while it 
was negative for the same test in two diffe rent lines of Chinese hamster cells. Similar 
conflicting results were obtained in other tests in vitro . 
Mutagenicity was detected, both in the absence and in the presence of metabolic 
activation, in the urine of mice and rats fe d with a diet containing CI Basic Red 9. 
However, the host-mediated assay with Salmonella  and S. cerevisiae  in mice, in the 
absence of a system of activation, was consistently negative. 
6. Evaluation 
6.1 Cancer in humans 
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of magenta production. 
Magenta production causes bladder cancer in humans. 
There is inadequate evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of magenta. 
6.2 Cancer in experimental animals 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of CI 
Basic Red 9 (para-magenta). 
There is inadequate evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of 
magenta. 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
Magenta production is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .

1.1.4  Technical products and impurities 
Pure 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (M OCA) is a colourless crystalline solid. 
Historically, the technical grade of MOCA th at is available in the United States came 
mainly from Japan in the form of tan/yellow fused prills or pastilles. The diamine purity is 
99.8%, typically with 0.2% free ortho -chloroaniline (monomer) (ATSDR, 1994). 
Trade names for 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chlo roaniline) include: Bisamine A; Bisamine 
S; CPP 100; Cuamine M; Cuamine MT; Cure ne 442; Diamet Kh; Ihara Cuamine MT; 
Isocross SM; Millionate M; Pandex E; Pandex M 3202; Quodorole; SL 4037. 
1.1.5  Analysis 
Analyses of 4,4'-methylenebis( 2-chloroaniline) were first reported in the 1970s. Two 
interesting recent studies have involved th e use of gas chromat ography/mass spectrometry 
to analyse water samples for the presen ce of 20 carcinogenic amines, and high-
performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with UV detection to determine amine levels in extracts from toys, at ppm–ppb (10
−6–10−9) concentrations (Garrigós et al., 2002; 
Doherty, 2005). Table 1.1 presents selected recent studies of the analysis of 4,4'-
methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) in various matrices. 
1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
MOCA is produced commercially by reacting formaldehyde with ortho -
chloroaniline. By-produ cts such as trimers and tetramers—diamines with three- and four-
ring structures joined by methylene groups—constitute up to 8–10% of commercial MOCA. 4,4'-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) comprises up to 90–92% of the commercial 
MOCA produced for coatings an d cast polyurethanes. There is no commercial use for 
pure 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) other than for laboratory work (ATSDR, 1994). 
Reports in early 1983 indi cated that US manufacturers no longer produced MOCA 
and that any MOCA used in the USA is imported (NTP, 2005). Since the production of 
MOCA in the US ceased in 1982, the amount of MOCA imported into the US has increased from 1.5 million pounds in 1983 to  approximately 2.0 m illion pounds in 1991. 
Most of the MOCA used in the US is manuf actured in Taiwan, Chin a, where the annual 
production is about 5000 to 10 000 tonnes (Chen et al. , 2005). 
Although production of MOCA ceased in the United Kingdom in 1987, the amount 
imported has increased from 90–120 tonnes in 1995 to more than 200 tonnes in 2006 
(Cocker et al. , 2009).  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 327

The USEPA (2003, 2007) Inventory Update Rule regulation requires manufacturers 
and importers of certain chemical substances listed in the TSCA Chemical Substance 
Inventory to report manufacturing inform ation (aggregate production volumes) for 
chemicals manufactured (including imported) in amounts of 10 000 pounds or greater (in 
1986) or 25 000 pounds or greater (in 2003) at a single site. Table 1.2 presents the 
aggregate production volumes that were reported for MOCA.  
Available information indicates that 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) was produced 
and/or supplied in the following  countries: Germany; Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region; Japan; the People’s Republic of China; South Africa; Switzerland; Taiwan, 
China; and the USA (Chemical Sources International, 2008).

1.2.2  Use 
4,4'-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) is an aromatic amine used for curing 
epoxy resins. It is mixed with diisocyanate-based pre-polymer resins to produce tough, 
resistant polyurethane products (Cocker et al. , 2009). The polyurethane prepolymers are 
used in the manufacture of castable urethane  rubber products such as shock-absorption 
pads and conveyor belting (IARC, 1993). In the laboratory, MOCA is used as a model 
compound for studying carcinogens (NTP, 2005; O’Neil, 2006). 
1.3 Occurrence and exposure 
1.3.1  Natural occurrence 
MOCA is not known to occur as a natural product. 
In MOCA-contaminated soil, the compound is rapidly adsorbed to the soil matrix and 
probably exists largely in a covalently bound state (Voorman & Penner, 1986).  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 329  
 1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
Occupational exposure to MOCA can occur during its production and during its use 
in the polyurethane industry. Workers can be exposed to MOCA  in the form of a liquid 
emulsion, solid pellets with dust, or solid pellets without dust. In most cases, dermal 
absorption after contact with contaminated surfaces is the most important occupational 
exposure route, with inhalation and ingestion representing minor routes of exposure 
(IARC, 1993). 
According to Rappaport and Morales (1979), in 1972 some 10 000 persons in 
industrialized countries were exposed occu pationally to MOCA in the context of 
manufacturing and processing (Will et al. , 1981). 
The Health and Safety Execu tive (HSE) in the United Kingdom estimates that in 
2005–2006, 300 workers in the United Kingdom were directly exposed to MOCA during 
polyurethane-elastomer production, and over 1000 workers such as office staff were indirectly exposed (HSE, 2007a). 
Estimates of the number of workers in th e USA potentially exposed to MOCA in 
1977 ranged from 2100 to 33 000. In 1979 an estimated 1400 workers in the USA were directly exposed and 7400 indirectly exposed while working in polyurethane 
manufacturing processes involving MOCA (Ward et al. , 1987). In 1982, the EPA 
estimated that 1400–2720 workers were direct ly exposed and 7600–15200 were indirectly 
exposed. 
(a) Exposure measurements  
Concentrations of MOCA in air, blood and urine and in surface-wipe samples have 
been reported for workers em ployed in the production and use of MOCA from a range of 
countries, including Australia, France, Ge rmany, Japan, Taiwan (China), the United 
Kingdom, and the USA. Different analytical methods have been applied, which can complicate comparisons of reported MOCA levels (see Section 1.1.5). 
Monitoring of airborne MOCA alone is considered ineffectiv e in the assessment of 
worker exposure (Robert et al. , 1999), and post-shift urine measurement is the most-
employed method to assess expos ure. Concentrations  of MOCA in urine reflect recent 
exposure, since the biological half-life of this compound is approximately 23 hours (Osorio et 
al., 1990). 
Some studies have determined urinary con centrations of acetyl-M OCA in addition to 
MOCA, showing that N-acetyl-MOCA is a minor urinary metabolite compared with the 
elimination of the parent amine (Cocker et al. , 1988; Shih et al. , 2007). 
An alternative to measuring MOCA in urine is to determine the concentrations of 
haemoglobin adducts of MOCA in blood. These adducts are st able for the lifespan of 
haemoglobin, which in humans is about 120 days (Vaughan & Kenyon, 1996). 330 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 (b) MOCA-production workers 
Air concentrations of MOCA have been reported from two MOCA-production plants. 
In a study from the USA (Linch et al. , 1971), the airborne concentration of MOCA was 
below the detection limit (< 0.01 mg/m3). In a study from Taiwan, China (Chen et al. , 
2005), the highest concentrations in air we re measured during the purification of MOCA 
(0.41 mg/m3). 
Urinary concentrations of MOCA in production workers have been reported from 
France, Taiwan (China), and the USA; they are summarized in Table 1.3. 
In a full-scale commercial MOCA-manuf acturing plant in the USA, urinary 
concentrations as high as 3000 µg/L were reported for the year 1969 (Linch et al. , 1971). 
The use of gloves and protective equipment su ch as suits and respirators was shown to 
lower exposure considerably. 
During a biological monitoring programme in a French factory that periodically 
produces MOCA, urinary concentrations were reported to range from < 0.5 μg/L up to 
1600 μg/L (Ducos et al. , 1985). 
In workers from a production plant in the USA, urinary concentrations of MOCA 
were measured several months after pr oduction had ceased. The maximum level 
measured was 50 000 μg/L (Ward et al. , 1990). [The Working Group noted that the high 
exposure levels reported may be due to continued exposure to MOCA after its production 
had ceased, through workplace and en vironmental contamination]. 
In 10 workers from a MOCA-manufactur ing plant in Taiwan, China (Liu et al., 2005), 
urinary concentrations ranged between 268 and 15701 μg/g creatinine (Table 1.3). 
In another study from Taiwan, China (Shih et al. , 2007), 54 urine samples were 
collected from workers in three MOCA-m anufacturing f actories. MOCA and acetyl-
MOCA ( N-acetyl-4,4’-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline)) were measured, with median 
values of 38.6 and 1.8 ng/mL, respectiv ely. MOCA concentrations correlated 
significantly with the co rresponding acetyl-MOCA con centrations in urine. 
(c) Polyurethane production workers 
Concentrations of MOCA have been m easured in the urine of polyurethane-
production workers from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the USA; results are summarized in Table 1.4. 
Five hours after an accidental  spill of hot MOCA onto th e face of a worker cleaning 
out a MOCA-delivery line in 1976, the urinary level of the exposed worker was 1400 μg/g creatinine (Hosein & Van Roosmalen, 1978). 
MOCA concentrations were measured in  49 urine specimens from MOCA-exposed 
personnel of a plastics manufacturing and processing plant in Germany (Will et al. , 1981). 
The concentrations ranged between 15–100 μg/L. 
During a biological monitoring programme conducted in 1978–1981 in a factory in 
the United Kingdom that manu factured polyurethane elastom ers by use of MOCA pellets, 
urinary MOCA concentrations were measured be fore and after introduction of safety   4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 331

 measures (ventilation, protec tive clothing, dry-cleaning scheme for overalls) (Thomas & 
Wilson, 1984). Concentrations dropped from an average of 50 nmol/mmol creatinine to less than 5 nmol/mmol creatinine. 
More than 340 analyses were performed on urine samples from 150 workers from 
19 polyurethane factories in France (Ducos et al. , 1985). In 17 factories where MOCA 
was used as solid pellets or in solutions for manufacturing a variety of products by 
coating, moulding or foaming urethane resins, mean concentrations of excreted MOCA in 
the urine of exposed workers varied from undetectable to 660 μg/L, with a maximum of 
1600 μg/L (1540 μg/g creatinine). Process improvements resulted in a significant 
reduction in urinary MOCA concen trations, to averages of 20–62 μg/L. 
The Michigan Department of Public H ealth tested urine samples of nine 
manufacturing workers, and reported MOCA concentrations ranging from 13 to 458 μg/L 
(mean, 145 μg/L) (Keeslar, 1986). 
In a NIOSH study of mixers and moulders in a polyurethane elastomer factory, 
MOCA urinary concentrations were increased  during the week and dropped over the 
weekend (NIOSH 1986). 
Between 1980 and 1983, 3323 urinary samples from 54 companies in the USA were 
analysed: MOCA concentrations exceeded 50 μg/L in 16.9% of the samples and 
exceeded 100 μg/L in 9.2% (Ward et al. , 1987). In 1985, the urinary concentration 
exceeded 50 μg/L in 12% of all samples tested. In 1990, 8% of the samples showed 
concentrations that were still above that level (Lowry & Clapp, 1992). 
Urinary MOCA concentrations were measured on a regular basis in seven factories in 
Australia that used MOCA  from 1984 onwards (Wan et al. , 1989). The measurements 
were done in five factories before and afte r a training programme promoting the safe use 
of MOCA; concentrations decreased from 29.6 μg/L to 10.4 μg/L. 
In a study from Japan, MOCA urinary concen trations were measured in five workers 
over one week (Ichikawa et al. , 1990). The concentrations at the beginning and the end of 
the workshift were 3.1–81.5 and 2.4–96.6 μg/g creatinine, respectively. The highest 
concentrations were measured for workers pouring the MOCA mix. 
Following the accidental spill of MOCA ont o the face of a polyurethane worker, 
urinary MOCA concentrations reached 1700 ppb [ μg/L] 4 hours after the accident (Osorio 
et al. , 1990). 
In 1986 a study was conducted at a company in the USA that used large amounts of 
MOCA in manufacturing polyurethane products (Clapp et al. , 1991). Sixty-six percent of 
the urine samples had detectable levels of MOCA, and the highest concentration 
measured was 159 μg/L. 
Urine samples were obtained from five workers involved in the production of 
polyurethane elastomers in Australia (Vaughan & Kenyon, 1996). The urine contained MOCA at 4.5–2390 nmol/L. Blood samples contained MOCA at 0.13–17.37 nmol/L. 
In another study from Australia (Murray & Edwards, 1999), 12 workers in the 
manufacture of polyurethane showed a median MOCA urinary concentration of  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 333  
 6.5 μmol/mol creatinine (range, 0.4–48.6 μmol/mol creatinine). MOCA was not detected 
in the urine of control workers. 
In a study from France (Robert et al. , 1999), postshift urinar y MOCA concentrations 
were determined in 40 workers from four factories producing polyurethane resin. 
Workers exposed directly to  crystallized MOCA on a daily basis had the highest 
concentration of MOCA in their urine, with a median value of 84 μg/L (49 μg/g 
creatinine). Concentrations by job category an d trends between 1982 and 1996 were also 
reported (see Table 1.4). 
In a small company manufacturing pl iable polyurethane, urinary MOCA 
concentrations were determined (Fairfax & Porter, 2006). None of the 13 employees had 
detectable amounts of MOCA except the one  who performed the urethane casting (15 
μg/L total MOCA in urine). Personal air samp les collected from the location where the 
urethane caster worked contained no detectable amounts of MOCA. 
A survey of occupational exposure to MOCA in the polyurethane-elastomer industry 
in Great Britain conducted in 2005–2006 (HSE, 2007a) included 20 polyurethane 
elastomer manufacturers and two suppliers of MOCA. Urinary concentrations ranged 
between 1.3–25.0 μmol/mol creatinine. 
(d) Occupational surface contamination 
Studies from the United Kingdom and USA re ported work-surface contamination in 
the polyurethane industry by determining MOCA concentrati ons in surface-wipe samples 
(Table 1.5). 
Data from occupational health and safety inspections from 41 polyurethane-
production facilities in the USA were assem bled (PEDCo Environmental, 1984) and 
reported surface contamination at facilities using solid and liquid MOCA. 
In 1986 a study was conducted at a co mpany in the USA that manufactured 
polyurethane products and was a large user of MOCA (Clapp et al. , 1991). Wipe 
sampling indicated moderate contaminatio n of the workplace by  MOCA dust, with 
averages up to 19 μg/100 cm2. The average MOCA concentr ation found on skin pads 
worn on workers’ hands was generally less than 10 μg/set, with a high of 25 μg/set. 
In a small company manufactur ing pliable polyurethane (Fairfax & Porter, 2006), the 
presence of MOCA on work surfaces was repo rted. Nine locations had non-detectable 
amounts of MOCA, including a desktop 15 feet from the urethane-casting area; the door handles of the mould oven, respirator locker , gloves locker and rest room; the top of an 
oven; the handle of the water dispenser in the breakroom; and the handle of a coffee mug. 
The top of a metal scale table had the highest amount, at 209.7 μg/m
2. 
In an occupational exposure survey conducted in 2005–2006 in the polyurethane-
elastomer industry in Great Britain, contamination of various surfaces with MOCA was 
reported (HSE, 2007a). The amounts det ected were similar for most surfaces. 
Contamination around th e hopper was generally above that  at the other sites, which was 
thought to be due to excess spillage of MOCA du ring hopper filling an d failure to clean it 
up immediately. 334 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 1.3.3  Exposure to the general population 
The general population can be exposed to  MOCA in an area that has been 
contaminated with MOCA or upon consumpti on of certain types of plants (e.g. root 
crops) grown in MOCA-contaminated soil. Also, immediate family members of workers exposed to MOCA can be affected. Concentr ations of MOCA in urine of up to 15 μg/L 
have been reported (Keeslar, 1986). 
1.3.4  Accidental release of MOCA in the environment 
Extensive environmental contamination with MOCA on several hundred hectares of 
land surrounding a MOCA plant occurred in  1979 in Adrian, MI, USA (Keeslar, 1986). 
Levels up to several milligrams per kilogram were found in gardens and community 
recreation areas. Of 12 selected children, aged  2 to 16 years, half were found to have 
detectable concentrations of MOCA ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 ppb [ μg/L] in the urine. 
These children were all under the age of six year s. Contact with  contaminated soil during 
playing and going barefoot was considered the most likely route of exposure. The general 
adult population living within the MOCA-con taminated area had no detectable levels of 
MOCA in the urine samples tested. 
The concentrations in sediment samples co llected from the lagoon used by the 
MOCA plant mentioned above ranged from 1600 to 3800 ppm [mg/kg dry weight]. Effluent water from the lagoon had a concentration of 250 ppb [ μg/L], deep-well water 
from under the plant had a concentration of 1.5 ppb [ μg/L], and surface runoff water 
contained 1 ppb [ μg/L]. Activated sludge from the sewag e-treatment plant contained an 
estimated 18 ppm [mg/kg]. MOCA was not detected in sewage treatment-plant influent or 
effluent water (detection limit 0.5 μg/L) or in the water of a river located near the plant 
(detection limit 0.1 μg/L) (Parris et al. , 1980). 
1.4 Regulations and guidelines 
1.4.1  Europe 
(a) Directive 97/56/EC 
According to Directive 97/56/EC on the restrictions on the marketing and use of 
certain dangerous substances and preparations, the packaging of 4,4 ′-methylenebis(2-
chloroaniline) and preparations containing this compound must be marked legibly and indelibly as follows: “Restricted to profess ional users” (European Commission, 1997). 
(b) Directive 2002/61/EC 
Directive 2002/61/EC restricts the marke ting and use of azocolourants (European 
Commission, 2002). In this Directive, A nnex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is amended. 
Azodyes which, by reductive cleavage of one or more azo groups, may release 4,4 ′-340 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) in detect able concentrations, i.e. above 30 ppm in 
the finished articles or in the dyed parts thereof, according to the testing method 
established in accord ance with Article 2a of this Directiv e, may not be used in textile and 
leather articles that may come into direct and prolonged contact with the human skin or 
oral cavity. 
(c) Directive 2004/37/EC 
4,4′-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) is regulated by the Directive 
2004/37/EC (European Commission, 2004), wh ich applies to activities in which workers 
are exposed to carcinogens or mutagens of Category 1 and 2. Rules are fixed regarding 
the employers' obligations of reduction and replacement, prevention and reduction of 
exposure, unforeseen exposure, foreseeable ex posure, access to risk areas, hygiene and 
individual protection, information for the competent authority, information and training of 
workers, consultation and participation of workers, health surveillance, record keeping 
and limit values. 
1.4.2  Japan 
The Japan Society for Occupational H ealth (JSOH; 2007) has reported an 
occupational exposure limit (OEL) value of 0.005 mg/m3 with a skin notation for 3,3 ′-
dichloro-4,4 ′-diaminodiphenylmethane [MOCA]. An Occupational Exposure Limit based 
on Biological Monitoring (OEL-B)  was mentioned of 50 µg/g-creatinine (total MOCA) in urine sampled at the end of  the shift at the end of the work week. The JSOH follows the 
classification by IARC of 3,3 ′-dichloro-4,4’-diaminodiphenylmethane in Group 2A. 
1.4.3  Germany 
4,4′-Methylenebis(2-chloroanilin e) (MOCA) is classified as a Category-2 carcinogen 
by the MAK Commission. The MAK Commission listed 4,4 ′-methylenebis(2-
chloroaniline) as a substance where percutaneous  absorption may significantly contribute 
to systemic exposure. A MAK value was not set (MAK, 2007). 
1.4.4  USA 
(a) ACGIH 
4,4′-Methylenebis(2-chloroani line) (MOCA) has been assi gned an A2 notation, 
suspected human carcinogen  (ACGIH, 2001). A TLV-TWA (threshold limit value–time-
weighted average) of 0.01 ppm (0.11 mg/m
3) is recommended. A skin notation is 
assigned ( potentially significant contribution to the overall exposure by the cutaneous 
route ) in recognition of the consensus that skin absorption from direct contact is the major 
source of occupational exposure. Implementa tion of a urine-monitoring programme to 
ensure the effectiveness of dermal  exposure control is encouraged.  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 341  
 (b) NIOSH 
4,4'-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is listed with a TWA of 0.02 ppm (0.22 mg/m3) 
[skin] as a recommended exposure limit (REL) not in effect (NIOSH, 1989). 
(c) NTP 
4,4′-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is listed in the NTP Report on Carcinogens  as 
reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen  (NTP, 2005). 
1.4.5  United Kingdom 
The Health and Safety Commission (HSE, 2007b) has set an 8-hour time-weighted 
average Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL) of 0.005 mg/m3 for 2,2'-dichloro-4,4'-
methylenedianiline (MOCA), with a skin nota tion. HSE also lists MOCA as capable of 
causing cancer and/or heritable genetic damage, and has defined a Biological Monitoring Guidance Value (BMGV) of 15 µmol total MO CA/mol creatinine in urine sampled after 
the work-shift.

 2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
2.1 Screening studies 
Ward et al.  (1988; 1990) reported three cases wi th noninvasive papillary tumours of 
the bladder identified in a screening study of 385 workers who had been exposed to 
MOCA in a chemical plant in Michigan, US A, from 1968 to 1979. Later on, Hogan 
(1993) assessed detailed occupational exposu res for the three cases by reviewing the 
chemical plant’s product catalogues, material safety-data sheets, and written 
documentation about chemicals used to pro duce specific products, and by examining job 
histories, the time frames of exposure, and job classifications. The study found that the 
three cases had been exposed to many other chem icals in addition to  MOCA during their 
time at the chemical plant and throughout thei r work history. Some of these chemicals are 
known or suspected bladder carcinogens ( ortho -toluidine, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine). 
In 1989, Fox Chase Cancer Center worked  with DuPont Chamber Works in New 
Jersey, USA to develop a bladder-cancer  screening programme for the high-risk 
population of workers who had been exposed to MOCA, β-naphthylamine, benzidine, or 
ortho -toluidine at this plant (Mason and Vogler 1990; Mason et al.  1992). During the first 
seven quarterly periods of screening, two new cases and one recurrent case of transitional 
cell carcinoma of the bladder were detected, but they had been exposed to occupational 
bladder carcinogens other than MOCA. 
Chen et al.  (2005) screened for bladder can cer at four MOCA-manufacturing 
factories in Taiwan, Ch ina that employed 70 workers wh o were directly involved in 
MOCA-manufacturing processes, including the reaction, ne utralization, washing, 
purification, and packing, or who were indirectly involved in the research and 
development laboratory. Ninety-two workers were not involved in the MOCA 
manufacturing or packing, nor were they wo rking in the same building as the employees 
involved in these activities. The prevalence of  atypical urinary cells and the nuclear 
matrix protein 22 tumour marker was not significantly different between the two groups 
of workers. However, the prevalence of posi tive occult blood was bo rderline-significantly 
(P = 0.055) greater in male exposed workers (18%) than in male non-exposed workers 
(7%). Among the 70 workers who had exposure to MOCA, there was one person with 
suspected malignant cells on urine cytology, on e person with atypical  cytology combined 
with gross haematuria, and one simply with  atypical cytology. One worker was absent 
from the screening programme because he was admitted to the hospital, where he was 
diagnosed with bladder cancer. Liu et al.  (2005) presented detailed information for the 
confirmed bladder-cancer case in his occupati onal history and environmental monitoring 
data. The confirmed bladder-cancer case had wo rked in the purificat ion process area for 
14 years (1987–2001), where the concentrat ion of MOCA in the air was the highest 
(0.23–0.41 mg/m3) and exceeded permissible OSHA exposure levels (0.22mg/m3), 
without wearing any personal protective equipm ent at work. Furthermore, the worker was 
a non-smoker without a history of exposure to any other bladder carcinogen, except for  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 343  
 occasional pesticides application du ring agricultural work before  he began working at this 
factory. 
3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
Animal bioassays conducted with 4,4 ′-methylenebis(chloroaniline) (MOCA) were 
reviewed in IARC Monograph Volume 57 (IARC, 1993). 
3.1 Oral administration 
3.1.1  Mouse 
Groups of 25 male and 25 female HaM/ICR mice, 6–8 weeks of age, were fed diets 
containing 0, 1000 or 2000 ppm MOCA as the hydrochloride (purity 97%) for 18 months. 
The doses were chosen on the basis of preliminary tests, the highest dose being the 
maximum tolerated dose. The effective numbers of animals at the end of the study were 
18, 13, and 20 males, and 20, 21, and 14 females in the control, low-dose and high-dose 
groups, respectively. Haemangiomas or haemangiosarcomas (mainly subcutaneous) 
combined occurred in 0/18, 3/13 (23%), and 8/20 (40%) in the control, low-dose, and 
high-dose groups of the male mice, and in 1/20 (5%), 0/21, and 6/14 (43%) of the female 
mice. ‘Hepatomas’ occurred in 0/20, 9/21 (43%), 7/14 (50%) in the control, low-dose, 
and high-dose groups of female mice ( P < 0.01, Fisher exact test) and in 3/18 (17%), 3/13 
(23%), 4/20 (20%) male mice. The incidence of lymphosarcomas and reticulum-cell 
sarcomas was decreased in treated females. Th e authors stated that the incidence of 
vascular tumours in the high-do se groups was comparable with that in historical controls 
of the same strain [and probably not treatment-related] (Russfield et al. , 1975). 
3.1.2  Rat 
Groups of 25 male and 25 female Wistar  rats, 100 days of age, were fed 0 or 
1000 ppm MOCA (purity unspecified) in a protein-deficient diet [not otherwise specified] 
for 500 days (total dose, 27 g/kg bw), followed by an observation period on protein-deficient diet. Animals were killed when mori bund; mean survival of treated males and 
females was 565 days and 535 days, respectively, and mean survival of male and female 
controls on the protein-deficient diet was 730 days. Of the 25 treated males, 23 died with tumours; ‘hepatomas’ occurred in 22/25 (88%) ( P < 0.001, Fisher exact test), and lung 
tumours (mainly carcinom as) in 8/25 (32%) ( P = 0.002, Fisher exact test). Among the 
treated females, 20 rats died with tumo urs; ‘hepatomas’ occurred in 18/25 (72%) 
(P < 0.001 Fisher exact test ), and lung tumours were observed in 5/25 (20%) ( P = 0.025, 
Fisher exact test). No ‘hepatoma’ or lung  tumour was observed among 50 control animals 
(Grundmann & Steinhoff, 1970). 344 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Groups of 25 male Charles River CD-1 rats, 6–8 weeks of age, were given diets 
containing 0, 500 or 1000 ppm MOCA as the hydrochloride (purity 97%) for 18 months. The doses were chosen on the basis of preliminary tests, the highest dose being the 
maximum tolerated dose. All surviving animals were killed 24 months after the start of 
the study; about 55% of the control and treat ed animals were still alive at 20–22 months. 
The effective numbers were 22 control, 22 low-dose and 19 high-dose animals. 
‘Hepatomas’ occurred in 0/22 control, 1/22 (5%) low-dose and 4/19 (21%) high-dose rats 
(P < 0.05, Cochran-Armitage trend test) (Russfield et al. , 1975). 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female Charles River CD rats, 38 days of age, were given 
0 (control) or 1000 ppm MOCA (purity appr oximately 95%) in a standard diet (23% 
protein) for two years. The av erage duration of the experiment was 560 days for treated 
males, 548 days for treated females, 564 days for male controls and 628 days for female 
controls. Six animals from each group were  sacrificed after one year for interim 
evaluation. Lung ad enocarcinomas occurred in 21/44 (48%) ( P < 0.05, χ
2-test) treated 
males and 27/44 (61%) ( P < 0.05, χ2-test) treated females. Squamous-cell carcinoma of 
the lung was observed in one treated male and one treated female. No lung tumour was 
observed among control animals. Lung adenomatosis, considered to be a preneoplastic lesion, developed in 14/44 (32%) treated males and 11/44 (25%) treated females, and in 
1/44 (2%) males and 1/44 (2%) females in the controls ( P < 0.05). Pleural mesotheliomas 
occurred in 4/44 (9%) treated males and 2/44 (5%) treated females; no such tumour was observed among controls. Hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas 
occurred in 3/44 (7%) and 3/44 (7%) treated males and in 2/44 (5%) and 3/44 (7%) 
treated females, respectively, but not in cont rols. Ingestion of MOCA  resulted in a lower 
incidence of pituitary tumours in treated  females than in controls (1/44 (2%) vs 12/44 
(27%)) (Stula et al. , 1975). 
In the same study, another 25 male and 25 female Charles River CD rats, 36 days of 
age, were given 0 (control) or 1000 ppm MOCA (purity approximately 95%) in a low-
protein diet (7%) for 16 m onths. Six animals from each group were sacrificed after one 
year for interim evaluation. The average duration of the experiment was 400 days for 
treated males, 423 days for treated females, 384 days for control males and 466 days for 
control females. Lung adenocarcinomas occurred in 5/21 treated males ( P < 0.05, χ
2-test) 
and 6/21 females ( P < 0.05, χ2-test); no such tumour developed in 21 untreated male or 
female controls. Lung adenomatosis was observed in 8/21 (38%) treated males and 14/21 
(67%) treated females and in 1/21 (5%) male controls and 1/21 (5%) female controls 
(P < 0.05, χ2-test). Hepatocellular adenomas occurred in 5/21 (24%) treated males 
(P < 0.05, χ2-test) and 2/21 (10%) treated femal es; hepatocellular carcinomas were 
observed in 11/21 (52%) treated males ( P < 0.05, χ2-test) and 1/21 (5%) treated females; 
no hepatocellular tumour was observed am ong 21 untreated males or females. 
Fibroadenomas of the mammary gland occurred in 1/21 (5%) treated and 7/21 (33%) 
control female rats ( P < 0.05). Mammary gland adenocarcinomas developed in 6/21 
(29%) treated and in 0/ 21 untreated females ( P < 0.05, χ2-test) (Stula et al. , 1975).  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 345  
 Groups of 100, 100, 75 and 50 male Charles River CD rats, 35 days of age, weighing 
90–167 gr, were fed either a “protein-adequa te” (27%) diet containing 0, 250, 500 or 
1000 mg/kg (ppm) MOCA (industrial grade [pur ity unspecified]) or a “protein-deficient” 
(8%) diet containing 0, 125, 250 and 500 ppm MOCA for 18 months, after which they 
were maintained on their respective diet w ithout MOCA for 6 months, followed by a 32-
week observation period. The mean survival tim e (in weeks) for the protein-adequate diet 
was: control, 89; low-do se, 87; mid-dose, 80 ( P < 0.01) (two-sided test, but method not 
specified); high-dose, 65 ( P < 0.001); for the protein-defi cient diet, these values were: 
control, 87; low-dose, 81; mid-dose, 79; high-dose, 77 ( P < 0.05). The numbers of rats on 
the protein-adequate diet still alive at week  104 were: control, 20/100; low-dose, 14/100; 
mid-dose, 10/75; and high-dose, 0/50 (at 84 weeks, there were six surviving rats in this group). The numbers of animals on the protein-de ficient diet still alive at week 104 were: 
control, 34/100; low-dose, 22/100; mid-dose, 14/75; and high-dose, 5/50. MOCA induced 
several tumour types in both  groups; the incidences of the predominant tumours are 
shown in Table 3.1. Dose-related increases in  the incidences of lung tumours, mammary 
adenocarcinomas, Zymbal gland carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas were 
observed in both experiments. The highest tumour incidence was observed in the lung. An increased incidence of h aemangiosarcomas was observed only in the group on the 
protein-deficient diet. In groups given 500 ppm MOCA, tumour incidence was generally 
lower in those fed the protein-deficient di et, but hepatocellular carcinomas and Zymbal 
gland carcinomas occurred at a higher incidence in this group (18 and 12%) than in the 
protein-adequate group (4 and 7%) (Kommineni et al. , 1979). 
3.1.3  Dog 
A group of six pure-bred female beagle do gs, approximately one year of age, were 
given a daily oral dose of 100 mg MOCA (~90%, ~10% polyamines with a three-ring structure and ~0.9% ortho -chloroaniline) in a gelatin capsule on three days per week for 
six weeks, then on five days per week for up to nine years. A further group of six female 
dogs served as untreated controls. One treated dog died early, at 3.4 years of age, because of intercurrent infection; the other animal s were killed between 8.3 and nine years. 
Transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder occurred in 4/5 (80%) treated dogs, 
and a composite tumour (transitional-cell carcinoma/adenocarcinoma) of the urethra 
developed in the 5th treated dog. No such tumours were observed among the six untreated 
control dogs ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) (Stula et al. , 1978).

 MOCA (94% pure) as a suspension in saline eith er once a week or at  longer time intervals 
for 620 days (88 weeks) (total dose, 25 g/kg bw). The rats were fed a laboratory diet with normal protein content. The mean observation period was 778 days (111 weeks). A total of 22 animals developed 29 malignant tumours. Hepatocellular carcinomas occurred in 9/34 (26%) ( P < 0.0042, Fisher exact test), and malignant lung tumours (six 
adenocarcinomas, one carcinoma) were observed in 7/34 (20%) animals ( P < 0.016, 
Fisher exact test). A malignant subcutaneous tumour (unspecified) was found in one rat (sex unspecified). Among 25 male and 25 female untreated controls (mean observation period, 1040 days (148 weeks)), a total of 13 malignant tumours, including one lung tumour, developed; no hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in the control group (Steinhoff & Grundmann, 1971). [The Working Group noted the inadequate reporting of the experiment.] 
3.3 Initiation-promotion studies 
3.3.1  Mouse 
Groups of 80 male and female SENCAR mice, 7–9 weeks of age, were given a single 
dermal application to the dorsal area of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 or 200 mg MOCA (purity not specified), and after a one-w eek interval 2 µg of 12- O-tetradecanobylp horbol-13-acetate 
(TPA) was applied twice a week for 26 weeks as a promoter. MOCA did not induce 
significant numbers of mouse skin  papillomas (Table 3.2) (Nesnow et al. , 1985). 
Groups of 20 female hairless albino HRA/Skh mice, about six weeks of age, were 
given a single dermal application of 12.5, 25, 50 or 100 mg MOCA (purity ≥ 90–100%). 
After one week, 5 μg of 12 -O-tetradecanonylphorbol -13-acetate (TPA) was applied twice 
a week for 21 weeks as a promoter. In this e xperiment MOCA was tested as an initiator. 
Mice were observed for one year; the minimu m diameter of the papillomas scored was 
approximately 1 mm. The group treated with 25 mg MOCA had a slightly higher tumour incidence (35%) than the controls (27%) at 25 weeks, and at 52 weeks (20% vs 16%). 
However, comparison of the control group response with any of the MOCA-treated groups did not show any statistically  significant diff erence (Rozinova et al. , 1998).

 In the same study, another group of 20 female hairless albino HRA/Skh mice, about 
six weeks of age, were given sing le dermal application of 2.56 μg 7,12-dimethyl-
benz[ a]anthracene (DMBA). After one week, derm al applications of 2.5 or 5 mg of 
MOCA (purity ≥ 90–100%) were started and continued twice a week for twenty weeks. 
In this experiment MOCA was tested as a promoter. Mice were observed for one year; the minimum diameter of the papillomas scored was approximately 1 mm. The negative 
control group received on ly a single application of DMBA. In  this group, the first tumour 
occurrence was observed at week 19; the maximum tumour yield was 0.55 ± 0.21 
tumours/mouse. In the 2.5-mg and 5-mg MOCA-promoted groups, the first tumour 
occurrence was observed at weeks 9 and 11, and the maximum tumour yields were 
0.65 ± 0.17 and 0.30 ± 0.14 tumours/mouse, respectively (Rozinova et al. , 1998). 
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion 
4.1.1  Humans 
Vaughan and Kenyon (1996) measured the conc entrations of MOCA in urine, plasma 
and blood, and the amounts of haemoglobin (Hb) adducts in exposed workers. Samples 
from five workers involved in the production  of polyurethane elastomers were examined. 
Gas chromatography/negative- ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC-NICI-MS) 
was used for the determination of pentafluoropropionyl derivatives of MOCA. Both 3, 3 ′-
dichlorobenzidine and [2H6]-MOCA were used as internal standards. Urinary 
concentrations of MOCA ranged over 500-fold, from 4.5 nmol/l (worker A) to 2390 
nmol/l (worker E). Adducted MOCA was released by alkali ne hydrolysis, and adduct 
levels were similar with or without dialysis of Hb. The Hb adducts ranged from 0.73 pmol/g Hb for worker A, who carried out general duties in the factory, to 43.3 pmol/g Hb 
for worker E, who was involved in mixing MOCA with a prepolymer. The former value 
is similar to that reported for 4-aminobiph enyl-Hb adducts in non-smokers (0.19 ± 0.08 
pmol/g Hb) and smokers (0.91 ± 0.28 pmol/g Hb) (Skipper & Tannenbaum, 1990). The 
higher values for MOCA adducts are similar to  concentrations of Hb adducts of 4,4'-
methylenedianiline (MDA), a st ructurally similar compound. Concentrations of 10.88 
pmol MDA/g Hb and higher values of 25.33 pmol N-acetyl-MDA/g Hb were reported for 
a worker (Bailey et al. , 1990), with a ratio of N-acetyl-MDA to MDA of 2.3. Although 
the actual value for pmol N-acetyl-MOCA/g Hb was no t given, the ratio of N-acetyl-
MOCA to MOCA was reported to range from 0.016 to 0.05 (Vaughan & Kenyon, 1996). 
This suggests that N-acetylation may not be an important pathway for MOCA 
metabolism. Blood MOCA concentrations were  determined after alkaline hydrolysis. 
Values for worker A (0.13 nmol/l) and worker  E (17.37 nmol/l) represented the lowest 
and highest levels in blood. Plasma values after alkaline hydrolysis were similar to those  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 349  
 in blood from corresponding workers, with those of workers A and E being 0.05 and 
21.95 nmol/l, respectively. When the latter sam ple was subjected to ultrafiltration, 85% 
was found to be associated w ith the high-molecular-weight fra ction, representing Hb and 
possibly other protein adducts. Hb adducts were thought to occur by activation of MOCA 
in a manner similar to DNA-adduct formation. While the half-life for excretion of MOCA 
in urine has been estimated to  be 23–24 hours, Hb has a life-span of about 120 days, and 
Hb adducts would reflect exposure over  this extended time course (Osorio et al. , 1990). 
While N-acetylation has been shown to be an important detoxifying pathway in the 
human biotransformation of many aromatic amines, this may not be the case for MOCA 
(see previous study). In workers exposed to  benzidine, more than 95% of measured 
urinary benzidine metabolites were present in N-acetylated form (Rothman et al. , 1996). 
Urinary levels of MOCA and its metabolites have been monitored in exposed workers, 
with only low concentrations of N-acetyl-MOCA and N,N′-diacetyl-MOCA observed 
(Ducos et al. , 1985; Cocker et al. , 1988). To evaluate whether N-acetylated products 
might be heat-labile conjugates, urine w as heated for 1.5 hours at 80°C (Cocker et al. , 
1988). This improved the detection of N-acetyl-MOCA. However, this did not produce 
ratios of N-acetylated to parent amine of greater than 0.09. More than half of the urine 
samples in this study had undetectable levels of N-acetyl-MOCA and thus were not used 
in the analysis. For heat-t reated urine, ratios for N-acetylated MOCA to MOCA ranged 
from 1 to 24 (Cocker et al. , 1988). Human liver homogenates catalysed N-acetylation of 
MOCA with rates for rapid and slow acetylator s similar to that observed with benzidine 
(Glowinski et al. , 1978). These results suggest that MOCA is either not N-acetylated in 
vivo or that it is acetylated and then rapidly deacetylated. The latter  was suggested when 
human liver slices incubated with [3H]-benzidine doubled their production of N-acetylated 
products with paraoxon (Lakshmi et al. , 1995). In urothelial cells of workers exposed to 
benzidine, the most predominant DNA adduct formed was N-acetylated, i.e. N'-
(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)- N-acetylbenzidine (Rothman et al. , 1996). In contrast, in urothelial 
cells of workers exposed to MOCA, th e major adduct was shown to be a non- N-
acetylated monocyclic adduct, N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol 
(Kaderlik et al. , 1993). N-Acetyl-MOCA is less mutagenic than MOCA as measured by 
the Ames test (Hesbert et al. , 1985), and no difference has been observed in  the induction 
of DNA repair in hepatocytes from either rapid or slow acetylat or rabbits (McQueen et 
al., 1983). Thus, the metabolism and activat ion of MOCA seems significantly different 
from that of benzidine or even 4,4 ′-methylenedianiline (MDA). 
4.1.2  Experimental animals 
N-Acetylation plays an important role in metabolism of aromatic amines in rats. For 
example, [3H]-labelled benzidine (180 mCi/mmol) is rapidly metabolized to its mono- 
and diacetylated pr oducts by male Fischer 344 rats. After 30 min, the recirculating 
perfusate from the isolated perfused rat liver showed a ratio of N-acetylated metabolites to 
benzidine of 14 (Lynn et al. , 1983; 1984). In contrast, N-acetylated heterocyclic amines 350 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 are not observed following administration of the parent compound to male Fischer 344 
rats (Armbrecht et al. , 2007). A study of female LAC:Porton rats given an intraperitoneal 
injection of [methylene-14C]-MOCA (8.3 mCi/mmol, radiochemical purity unspecified) 
reported at least nine metabolites and showed evidence of an O-glucuronide, an O-sulfate, 
and amino-chlorophenol. However, no N-acetylated metabolites were reported (Farmer et 
al., 1981). Another extensive study with male  CD rats (30 days old; immature) assessed 
the metabolism of orally dosed [methylene-14C]-MOCA (4 to 7 mCi/mmol; ~93% radio-
chemical purity). Evidence of an O-glucuronide and an O-sulfate in urine was found, 
along with the major metabolite in bile, i.e. the mono- N-glucuronide of MOCA. 
However, no N-acetylated products were reported (Morton et al. , 1988). 
Rat microsomal CYPs catalysed formation of three hydroxylated MOCA metabolites, 
N-OH, 5-OH, and methylene-OH. N-OH-MOCA is thought to participate in MOCA 
binding to DNA. The major MOCA-DNA ad duct in rats was shown to be a non- N-
acetylated monocyclic adduct, N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol 
(Silk et al. , 1989). This adduct was al so formed by reaction of N-OH-4-amino-3-
chlorobenzyl alcohol with DNA. 
While MOCA is a substrate for rat N-acetyltransferases, N-acetylated pr oducts of 
MOCA have not been reported in urine or bile of rats that were given this amine. 
Sabbioni and Neumann (1990) developed a quantitative method to determine 
MOCA-protein adducts. Female Wistar rats  received oral doses of 3.82, 14.2 and 
16.2 μmol/kg bw [14C]-ring-labelled MOCA or 0.25 and 0.50 mmol/kg bw unlabelled 
MOCA. MOCA bound in decreasing amounts to macromolecules in the lung, liver and 
kidney. Fractions of 0.19% and 0.026% of the dose were bound to the blood proteins haemoglobin and albumin, respectively. MOCA was released by hydrolysis from 
haemoglobin, and determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection or by GC-MS. 
However, in contrast to ma ny other aromatic amines, only 54% of the haemoglobin-
bound [
14C]-labelled metabolites are hydrolysable, while none of the radioactivity could 
be released from albumin. This implies th e existence of additi onal reactive species, 
presumably originating from metabolic cl eavage at the methylene-bridge in MOCA, 
which yields stable protein adducts. 
Macromolecular binding in rats afte r oral and dermal application of [14C]-labelled 
MOCA has also been described (Cheever et al. , 1990). 
Chen et al.  (1991) studied the capacity of N-oxidized metabolites of MOCA to form 
haemoglobin (Hb) adducts in animals with or without induction of CYP enzymes with 
phenobarbital or β-naphthoflavone. Intrav enous administration of as little as 0.04 µmol/kg 
N-hydroxy-MOCA to rats resulted in measura ble formation of MOCA-Hb adducts (0.9 
ng/50 mg Hb). Intraperitoneal administration of 0.5–50 mg/kg MOCA to rats, and 
subcutaneous administration of 5–500 mg/kg MOCA to rats and 4–100 mg/kg to guinea-
pigs resulted in dose-related formation of  Hb adducts. MOCA-Hb adducts remained 
elevated in blood for longer than 10 week s following a single subcutaneous dose in 
guinea-pigs. Pretreatment of rats with  phenobarbital would induce microsomal 
benzphetamine N-demethylase (BND) activity in rats, a nd result in a small increase in in- 4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 351  
 vitro N- and ortho -hydroxylation of MOCA, but did not increase in-vivo Hb adduct 
levels. Pretreatment of rats with β-naphthoflavone induced microsomal aryl hydrocarbon 
hydroxylase as well as ethoxyresorufin- O-deethylase and increased the formation of 
MOCA-Hb adducts when the animals were dosed with MOCA at 100 and 500 mg/kg, but 
not 20 mg/kg subcutaneously (Chen et al.  1991). 
Cheever et al.  (1991) studied the multiple oral administration of MOCA in adult male 
rats. As many as 28 consecutive daily doses of [14C]MOCA at 28.1 µmol/kg bw (5 
µCi/day) were given. Rats were killed at weekly intervals for seven weeks. MOCA adduct formation for globin and serum al bumin was evaluated by determination of 
[
14C]MOCA covalent binding. The covalent bi nding associated with  globin showed a 
linear increase over the 28-day exposure period with 342 fmol/mg globin 24 hours after the final dose. The covalent binding with albumin was 443 fmol/mg albumin. After 
cessation of dosing, the albumin and globin a dduct levels decreased rapidly with a half-
life of the respective proteins. 
Bailey et al.  (1993) studied the exposure of rats to [
14C]ring-labelled MOCA. At 24 
hours after a single intraperito neal dose (3.74 µmole/kg bw),  0.08% of the administered 
dose was adducted to haemoglobin (Hb) and alkaline hydrolysis liberated 38% of the bound radioactivity as the parent MOCA. The formation of adducts correlated linearly 
with the dose of MOCA (3.74–44.94 μmole/kg bw). 
The biological availability of the N-hydroxylated derivatives of ortho -substituted 
diamines and of known carcinogenic diamines was investigated in female Wistar rats by 
determining haemoglobin (Hb) adducts. Hb from rats dosed with 0.5 mmol/kg diamine 
and from untreated control ra ts were isolated and hydrol ysed. The released diamine and 
monoacetyldiamine were quantified by HPLC with electro chemical detection or GC/MS. 
MDA, 4,4 ′-oxydianiline (ODA), 4,4 ′-ethylenediamine, and 4,4 ′-thiodianaline (TDA) 
bound to haemoglobin as diamine and as monoacetyl-diamine. 4,4 ′-Methylenebis(2,6-
dimethylaniline), 4,4 ′-methylenebis(2,6-diethylaniline), MOCA, and 4,4 ′-sulfonyl-
dianiline (daspone) bound only as diamine to Hb. 4,4 ′-Methylenebis (2,6-dichloroaniline) 
did not bind to Hb. Thus, the prese nce of two substituents in the ortho  position and the 
presence of electron-with drawing groups in the para position relative to the amino group 
drastically reduced the formation of Hb adducts. The extent of haemoglobin binding of 
the bicyclic diamines (daspone, 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine, MDA, MOCA, TDA, ODA, and 
benzidine) increases with their carcinogenic  potency (Sabbioni & Schütze, 1998). 
4.1.3  In-vitro studies 
Because occupational exposure to MOCA occu rs mainly through skin penetration, 
Hewitt et al.  (1995) evaluated decontamination procedures in vitro  using fresh full-
thickness human breast skin. Flow -through diffusion cells were used to determine the 
effect of four washing solutions (100% ethanol, 100% water, 1 and 10% (v/v) aqueous 
soap). All solutions were equally e ffective at removing MOCA (ring-[
14C]-MOCA, 
specific activity 59 mCi/mmol; radi ochemical purity > 96%; 10–18 μg/cm2) from the 352 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 surface of human skin, with 22–47% of the applied dose re moved at 72 hours. The 
penetration of MOCA into and through human skin at 72 hours was significantly reduced (two- to threefold) by washing the skin surface at 3 or 30 mi n. Washing at one hour after 
application significantly reduced total uptake , but this was less effective than at earlier 
time points. These results suggest that MOCA is  rapidly absorbed from the skin surface 
into the skin. To reduce system ic exposure, the authors sugg ested that skin should be 
washed within the first 30 mi nutes after contamination. The ch oice of washing solution is 
less critical than is the time of washing. Similar results were observed for MDA. These 
results are consistent with previous studi es showing that the uptake of MOCA from the 
skin surface into the skin it self is rapid, reaching a maximum only one hour after 
application (Hewitt et al. , 1993). This suggest s the presence of a cutaneous reservoir 
within the skin. 
Wiese et al.  (2001) showed that recombinant human COX-1 and COX-2, isoforms 
of prostaglandin H synthase, activate MOCA, given as [4,4'-methylene-
14C]MOCA (8.66 
mCi/mmol), to bind to DNA. Besides MOCA, several different aromatic and heterocyclic 
amines were studied. Prostaglandin H synthase is composed of two separate isoenzymes, 
cyclooxygenase and hydrope roxidase. The latter ut ilizes these amines as reducing 
substrates. Binding was found to be arachidonic acid-dependent. The highest DNA 
binding was observed with MOCA. hCOX-2 activated MOCA nearly twice as effectively 
as did hCOX-1. In contrast, activation of the other amines by both enzymes was similar. 
While benzidine-DNA binding was reduced by BSA, this was not observed with MOCA. 
The peroxidative activity of human lung microsomes was shown to activate MOCA 
(14C-MOCA, specific activity 46.7 mCi/mmol) to bind DNA (Culp et al. , 1997). With 
specific antisera it was demonstrated that  myeloperoxidase was responsible for DNA 
binding. Binding was dependent on H 2O2 and was inhibited by azide, but not by 
indomethacin or eicosat etraynoic acid (Culp et al. , 1997). This is consistent with 
myeloperoxidase-mediated rather than prosta glandin H synthase-mediated binding. The 
source of myeloperoxidase was thought to be the polymorphonuclear neutrophils. These 
cells are involved in the in flammatory response, which can  contribute to carcinogenesis 
(Parsonnet, 1999). Results demonstrate that  different enzymes mediate peroxidative 
activation of MOCA to bind to DNA. 
While human CYP1A2 N-hydroxylates many arylamines, MOCA is an exception, 
preferring CYP2A6 or CYP3A4 (Butler et al. , 1989; Yun et al. , 1992). 
[3H]N-OH-MOCA (20 mCi/mmol) was found to be metabolically activated by 
3′-phosphoadenosine-5 ′-phosphosulfate (PAPS)-dependent  human liver sulfotransferases 
to bind to DNA (Chou et al. , 1995). In 12 human hepatic cytosols, binding was 
significantly correlated with levels of ther mostable phenol-sulfotransferase activity, but 
not with thermolabile phenol- or dehydro-epiandrosterone-sulfotransferase activities. Binding was prevented by 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol, a potent selective inhibitor for 
human thermostable phenol sulfotransferase. N-OH-MOCA was a good substrate for 
sulfotransferase in human liver cytosols, but not in cytosols from human urinary bladder epithelium. Thermostable phenol-sulfotrans ferase is polymorphically distributed and  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 353  
 could contribute to individual diff erences in carcinogen susceptibility. N-Hydroxyaryl-
amines are thought to  initiate DNA-adduct formation (Chou et al. , 1995). 
Walraven et al.  (2006) used recombinant rat N-acetyltransferases to assess 
N-acetylation of MOCA by the enzymes Nat1, Nat2, and Nat3 via HPLC analysis of non-
radioactive metabolites. MOCA was N-acetylated by all three transferases. Nat3 (the 
recently discovered third rodent N-acetyltransferase) metabolized MOCA along with six 
other arylamines. However, Nat3-mediated metabolism of MOCA was at the limit of 
detection. Nat1 and Nat2 each metabolized 12 of the 13 arylamines tested. MOCA was 
only one of three amines found to be selectively N-acetylated by recombinant rat Nat1. In 
contrast, 4,4'-methylenedianiline was one of ni ne substrates selectively metabolized by rat 
Nat2. Previous studies have demonstrated N-acetylation of MOCA by human and rabbit 
liver homogenates (Glowinski et al. , 1978). N-Acetylation of MOCA by human rapid and 
slow acetylators was similar to that observed with benzidine. 
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
4.2.1  Humans 
Exfoliated urothelial cells were reco vered from urine samples from a worker 
accidentally sprayed with molten MOCA. Samples were collected at different times—up 
to 430 hours—after exposure (Osorio et al. , 1990). The occurrence of MOCA-DNA 
adducts was investogated in these exfoliated urothelial cells by 32P-post-labelling analysis. 
The major DNA adduct was N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-aminochlorobenzyl alcohol. This 
MOCA-DNA adduct was detected in samples obtained between 4 and 98 hours after 
initial exposure but not in samples collected at later times. The level of DNA adducts 
4 hours after exposure was determined to be 516 adducts/108 nucleotides. A five-fold 
decrease in adduct level was observed 14 hours later, followed by a gradual decrease over 
subsequent days (Kaderlik et al.  1993). 
An increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange, consistent with their apparent 
exposure to MOCA, was seen in peripheral lymphocytes from a small number of workers 
exposed to MOCA during the manufacture of polyurethane (Edwards & Priestly, 1992). 
In a study from Australia, micronucleus induction was measured in peripheral 
lymphocytes and exfoliated urothelial cells of workers exposed to MOCA. Twelve male 
workers (age 24–42 years) were recruited fo r this study from four work locations where 
exposure was noted. Exfoliated urothelial cells from pre-work urine samples on a 
midweek work-day were assessed for micronu cleus (MN) frequency. Post-work urine 
samples were analysed for total MOCA. Blo od samples were collected on the same day 
and were cultured for 96 hours. Cytochalasin-B-blocked cells were scored for MN. 
Eighteen male control subjects (age 23–59 years) provided corresponding urine and blood 
samples. Average urinary MOCA concentrati ons were 6.5 µmol/mol creatinine (range 
0.4–48.6 µmol/mol creatinin e) in post-work samples of MOCA-exposed workers. MOCA 
was not detected in the urine of control workers. Mean MN frequencies were higher in 354 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 urothelial cells and lymphocytes of MOCA-exposed workers (14.27 ± 0.56 and 
13.25 ± 0.48 MN/1000 cells) than in control subjects (6.90 ± 0.18 and 9.24 ± 0.9 MN/1000 cells). The mean number of micronucl eated cells was also higher in both tissues 
of exposed workers (9.69 ± 0.32 and 8.54 ± 0.14 MN cells/1000 cel ls) than in control 
subjects (5.18 ± 0.11 and 5.93 ± 0.13 MN cells/1000 cells) (Murray & Edwards, 1999). 
More recently, the same authors studied cytogenetic endpoints, including the 
formation of micronuclei (MN) in exfoliated cells and lymphocytes, to estimate the risk 
for genotoxic events in workers exposed to  MOCA and bitumen fumes (which contain 
skin and lung carcinogens). Twelve men employed in polyurethane manufacture, who 
had been exposed to MOCA, 12 bitumen road-layers (exposed to bitumen fumes 
containing PAHs) and 18 hospital-store personnel (controls) were recruited for the study. All provided blood and urine samples on the same day. Blood cultures were prepared by 
use of a cytochalasin B-block method. Exfoliated urothelial cells were collected from 
urine and stained for micro scopy. The number of MN w as higher in MOCA-exposed 
workers (14.27 ± 0.56 MN/1000 cells; 9.69 ± 0.32 micronucleated cells/1000 cells) than 
in bitumen-exposed workers (11.99 ± 0.65 MN/1000 cells; 8.66 ± 0.46 micronucleated 
cells/1000 cells). The MN frequency in cont rol subjects was 6.88 ± 0.18 MN/1000 cells 
(5.17 ± 0.11 micronucleated cells/1000 cells ). Conversely, in lymphocytes, MN 
frequencies were higher in bitumen-exposed workers (16.24 ± 0.63 MN/1000, 
10.65 ± 0.24 MN cells/1000) than in MOCA-exposed workers (13.25 ± 0.48 MN/1000, 8.54 ± 0.14 MN cells/1000) or in control subjects (9.24 ± 0.29 MN/1000 or 5.93 ± 0.13 
MN cells/1000). The MN frequency values for the various groups were all significantly 
different from each other ( P < 0.01). The results  suggest that these ge notoxins could cause 
MN formation to a different extent in different tissues (Murray & Edwards, 2005). 
4.2.2  Experimental systems 
(a) Animals 
In an early study, Kugler-Steigmeier et al.  (1989) showed that MOCA produced 
DNA adducts in the liver of Sprague-Dawley rats at levels typically found for moderately 
strong genotoxic carcinogens. 
In rats given a single dose of 95 μmol/kg bw [methylene-
14C]MOCA by gavage, 
DNA adducts were found after 24 hours at 7 pmol/mg DNA in liver, 2 pmol/mg in lung 
and 0.5 pmol/mg in kidney. These adducts, N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-
chlorobenzyl alcohol and N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorotoluene were 
eliminated from rat liver with nonlin ear kinetics. The selective reaction of N-hydroxy-
MOCA with adenine in DNA, and the forma tion of a single arylamine ring adduct 
suggest a substitution mechanism involving an intermediate with a strong S N1 character, 
aided by the negative inductive effect of the ortho -chlorine. Due to tautomer formation, 
the initial adduct may be inherently unstable and undergo cleavage at the 1 ′-carbon-
methylene bond to yield the observed adducts (Segerbäck & Kadlubar, 1992).  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 355  
 Segerbäck et al.  (1993) applied 32P-postlabelling analysis to determine DNA adducts 
of MOCA in target and non-target tissues in dogs. Beagle dogs were treated with single 
and multiple doses of MOCA, and DNA-adduct levels were determined in liver and 
bladder epithelium. After a single dose, the level of adducts in the liver was 1.5-fold 
higher than that in the bladder epithelium. The amounts of adducts in these two organs 
increased three- to five-fold after 10 doses, an d adducts in the liver were then 2.8-fold 
higher than in the bladder epithelium. The am ounts found in these two organs after single 
exposures were compared, per unit exposur e dose, with those reported for other 
carcinogenic aromatic amines. The comparison  showed that MOCA was as effective in 
DNA-adduct formation as were most other potent urinary bladder carcinogens. These 
results suggest that MOCA may have hi gh carcinogenic potential in humans. 
DeBord et al.  (1996) studied adduct formation by 32P-postlabelling in rats treated with 
MOCA and in human uro-epit helial cells treated with N-OH-MOCA. In both cases, the 
major adduct corresponded to N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol. 
(b) In-vitro studies  
Shivapurkar et al.  (1987) found that MOCA could bind with DNA of explant cultures 
of human and dog bladders. In both humans and dogs, there appeared to be a population 
of cells with high DNA binding and another with low DNA binding. The binding of MOCA to human bladder DNA appeared to be higher than to dog bladder DNA. 
MOCA formed adducts with DNA in cultured canine and human bladder cells, and in 
liver, lung and kidney of rats treated topically, intraperitoneally or orally. One of three HPLC peaks of an enzymatic digest  of DNA derived from rats treated in vivo  was 
identified tentatively as N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3 -chlorobenzyl alcohol (Silk 
et al. , 1989). 
Kuslikis et al. , (1991) found that N-Hydroxy-MOCA was mutagenic to Salmonella  
typhimurium  TA98 and TA100 in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activation 
system. Other MOCA metabolites, ortho -hydroxy-MOCA, 4-amino-3,3 ′-dichloro-4 ′-
nitrosodiphenyl-methane (mononitroso derivative) and di-(3-chloro-4-nitrosophenyl) 
methane (dinitroso derivative), were not mutagenic to S. typhimurium  TA98 or TA100. 
The mutagenic activity of the mononitroso derivative towards strain TA100, however, appeared to be mask ed by its toxicity. 
Reaction of N-hydroxy[methylene-
14C]-MOCA with DNA in vitro  resulted in the 
formation of two major adducts, which we re identified by mass spectroscopy as 
N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol and N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-
amino-3-chlorotoluene (Kuslikis et al. , 1991). 
The SV40-immortalized human uroepithelial cell line SV-HUC.PC was used to study 
the malignant transformation capacity of N-OH-MOCA. SV-HUC.PC cells were exposed 
in vitro  to various concentrations of N-OH-MOCA. The carcinogen-treated cells were 
propagated in culture for about six weeks a nd subsequently inject ed subcutaneously 
into athymic nude mice. Two of the 14 diff erent groups of SV-H UC.PC cell cultures 
treated with different concentrations of N-OH-MOCA formed carcinomas in these mice. 356 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 32P-postlabelling analyses of DNA isolated from SV-HUC.PC cells after exposure to 
N-OH-MOCA revealed one major and one mi nor adduct. The majo r adduct has been 
identified as the N-(deoxyadenosin-3 ′,5′-bisphosph-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol 
(pdAp-ACBA) and the minor adduct as N-(deoxyadenosin-3 ′,5′-bisphospho-8-yl)-4-
amino-3-chlorotoluene (pdAp-ACT). Furtherm ore, the SV-HUC.PC cytosols catalysed 
the binding of N-OH-MOCA to DNA in the presence of acetyl-CoA, to yield similar 
adducts (Swaminathan et al. , 1996). 
Reid et al.  (1998) explored the genotoxic potential of MOCA by monitoring the 
induction of mutations at the HPRT  locus of AHH-human lymphoblastoid cells. Exposure 
of AHH-1 cells to N-OH-MOCA was found to induce a six-fold increase in mutant 
frequency and resulted in base-pair substitution  primarily at A:T base pairs. The induction 
of mutations at A:T sites by N-OH-MOCA provides a marker of genotoxic damage for an 
exposed population (Reid et al. , 1998). 
Birner et al.  (1990) have shown that ortho -substitution with methyl groups of 
benzidine to produce 3,3 ′-5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine results in non-mutagenic derivatives 
(Chung et al. , 2000) that also do not bind to haemoglobin. It is thought that in 
4,4′-methylenediamine (MDA) or MOCA, bulky substituents in the ortho  position 
eliminate the mutagenicity and carcinoge nicity of MDA and MOCA, presumably by 
inhibiting the formation of the N-OH-arylamines, which are the putative genotoxic 
intermediates. 
The major metabolite of MOCA in the urine of dogs is identified as 3,3 ′-dichloro-
4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane-5-sulfate. Upon hydrolysis of this metabolite with 
arylsulfatase, time- and enzyme concentr ation-dependent prot ein binding and time-
dependent DNA binding of this material we re observed. However, the metabolites were 
not mutagenic towards Salmonella  tester strain TA98 at up to 20 µg/plate, and cytotoxic 
to the tester strain at 50 μg/plate (Manis & Braselton, 1984). 
(c) Summary of short-term genotoxicity tests (IARC, 1993)  
MOCA was shown to cause prophage induction in Escherichia coli  (Thomson, 1981) 
and differential toxicity in Bacillus subtilis rec -deficient strains (K ada, 1981). It was 
mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium  (Bridges et al. , 1981), Escherichia coli  
(Matsushima et al. , 1981) and at the Tk locus in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells 
(Mitchell et al. , 1988; Myhr & Caspary, 1988), but not to Saccharomyces cerevisiae  
(Mehta & von Borstel, 1981). MOCA caused aneuploidy in S. cerevisiae  (Parry & Sharp, 
1981) but gave equivocal results with regard to gene conversion and did not induce 
mitotic crossing-over in the same organism (Jagannath et al. , 1981). It induced mutation 
in Drosophila melanogaster  (Kugler-Steigmeier et al. , 1989) and unscheduled DNA 
synthesis in primary cultures of hepatocytes from mice (McQueen et al. , 1981), rats 
(McQueen et al. ; 1981; Williams et al. ; 1982; Mori et al. , 1988), and Syrian hamsters 
(McQueen et al. , 1981). Sister chromatid exchange but not chromosomal aberration was 
induced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Galloway et al. , 1985). MOCA induced cell 
transformation in mammalian cells (Daniel & Dehnel, 1981; Dunkel et al. , 1981; Styles,  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 357  
 1981) and inhibited gap-junctional intercellu lar communication in cultured rat-liver cells 
(Kuslikis et al. , 1991). MOCA induced sister chromatid exchange in lymphocytes of rats 
treated in vivo  (Edwards & Priestly, 1992). 
4.3 Mechanistic considerations 
The toxicological profile of MOCA is quite similar to that of monocyclic aromatic 
amines: MOCA causes an increased  incidence of bladder tumours in exposed workers, 
bladder tumours in dogs, lung and liver tumours in rodents, and hemangiosarcoma and 
hepatoma, among others, in rats and mice. The genotoxic properties of MOCA have been broadly documented previously (IARC, 1993). 
MOCA is N-oxidized, and the resulting metabolites bind to DNA, RNA and proteins. 
Interestingly, two different kinds of activation product are formed, and the question of how they contribute to the biological eff ects has not been answ ered. A hydrolysable 
haemoglobin adduct has been found in humans and in experimental animals. MOCA is 
practically the only cleavage product released from the adduct after oral administration to 
rats. This indicates that the non-acetylated MOCA and not N´-acetyl-MOCA is N-
oxidized (Sabbioni & Neumann, 1990). MOCA is different from other bifunctional 
amines, such as benzidine and 3,3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine, for which predominantly N´-
acetylated adducts are formed (Neumann, 1988). 
The expected 2-chloro-4-methylaniline (2-chloro- meta-toluidine) was not detected 
upon hydrolysis of the haemoglobin adducts found in rats. It should have been formed when it is a major metabolite that is N-ox idized to the respective hydroxylamine and 
nitroso-derivative. O bviously other reactive forms yield the nonhydrolyzable adducts of 
haemoglobin and albumin. Structurally, 2-chloro- meta-toluidine is related to 4-chloro-
ortho -toluidine, in which the two substituents are exchanged. In both cases a bulky 
substituent is in the ortho -position to the amine and the para-position is blocked. 
Although experimental data do not seem to ex ist, similar biological properties would be 
expected. Overall, MOCA shows many pr operties typical for aromatic amines and 
monocyclic amines in particular, which supports the idea of a common mode of action for 
this class of chemicals.  
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
4,4′-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) is  widely used as a curing agent in the 
polyurethane industry. Occupational exposure to MOCA has been reported in industries 
that manufacture and use MOCA. Dermal abso rption after contact with contaminated 
surfaces appears to be the most important route of exposure, with inhalation and ingestion 
representing minor routes. Post -shift urine measurements represent the most appropriate 358 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 method to measure workers’ exposure. Urinary levels of MOCA have been reported for 
MOCA production workers and polyurethane pr oduction workers in Australia, France, 
Germany, Japan, Taiwan (China), the United Kingdom, and the USA. 
MOCA does not occur in nature. The general population can be exposed to MOCA if 
they live in an area contam inated with this compound. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
No adequate epidemiological  studies were available to the Working Group to 
evaluate an association between exposure to 4,4 ′-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) and 
bladder cancer risk. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
MOCA was tested for carcinogenicity by oral  administration in the diet in mice in one 
study, in rats of each sex in two studies, in male and female rats in a further two studies 
using normal and low-protein diets, and in one study using capsules in female dogs. It 
was also tested by subcutaneous ad ministration to rats in one study. 
Oral administration of MOCA increased th e incidence of liver tumours in female 
mice. In a series of experiments in which rats  were fed either standard or low-protein 
diets, it induced liver-cell tumours and malignant lung tumours in males and females in one study, a few liver-cell tumours in male rats in another, lung adenocarcinomas and 
hepatocellular tumours in males and females in a third, and malignant lung tumours, 
mammary gland adenocarcinomas, Zymbal gland carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas in a fourth. Oral administration of MOCA to female beagle dogs produced 
transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder and urethra. Subcutaneous 
administration to rats produced hepatocellul ar carcinomas and malignant lung tumours. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
The toxicological profile of MOCA is ty pical for biologically active monocyclic 
aromatic amines. It is metabolically activated by N-oxidation to metabolites that react 
with DNA and proteins. The genotoxicity of MOCA is well documented. The acute 
toxicity is reflected by methaem oglobin formation, spleen toxicity, fibrosis in spleen and 
often in liver and kidney of rodents. The profile is comparable with those of ortho -
toluidine and 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, thus indicating a common mode of action. 
MOCA is mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium , E. coli , Drosophila melanogaster , 
and human lymphoblastoid cells. It causes prophage induction in E. coli , differential 
toxicity to Bacillus subtilis  rec-deficient strains, and mutations at the Tk locus in mouse 
lymphoma L5178Y cells. It  causes aneuploidy in S. cerevisiae  and unscheduled DNA 
synthesis in the primary cultures of hepatocytes from mice, rats, and Syrian hamsters.  4,4'-METHYLENEBIS(2 -CHLOROANILINE) 359  
 MOCA induces sister chromatid exchange in lymphocytes of rats. It forms DNA 
adducts in cultured canine and human bladder cells, and in the lung, liver, and kidney of rats treated with MOCA. It inhibits intercellular communication in cultured rat liver cells. 
The MOCA metabolite, N-OH MOCA, forms DNA adducts in rat liver, causes malignant 
transformation in SV40-immortalized human SV.HUC.PC uroepithelial cells, which subsequently produce carcinomas in athymic nude mice. MOCA also binds to protein 
RNA, and DNA of rats. 
MOCA has been shown to interact with DNA to form adducts in urothelial cells, and 
with haemoglobin to form ad ducts in the blood of exposed workers. MOCA has been 
shown to cause the formation of sister chromatid exchange and micronuclei in urothelial 
cells and lymphocytes of exposed humans. Chromosomal aberrations have been shown to be a good predictor of carcinogenicity. 
6. Evaluation and Rationale 
6.1 Cancer in humans 
There is inadequate evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of 4,4 ′-
methylenebis(2-chloroaniline). 
6.2 Cancer in experimental animals 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of 
4,4′-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline). 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
4,4′-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) . 
6.4 Rationale 
In reaching this evaluation the Work ing Group considered  the following: 
• MOCA shows many properties typical for monocyclic aromatic amines, e.g., 
ortho -toluidine, which supports the notion of a common mode of action for this 
class of chemicals. 
• MOCA is genotoxic in numerous assays for genotoxicity. 
• In rats and dogs, species in which MOCA has shown to produce tumours, this 
compound is metabolized to N-hydroxy-MOCA, which forms DNA adducts. 
• One of the two major MOCA-DNA adduct s found in the ta rget tissues for 
carcinogenicity in animals (rat liver a nd lung; dog urinary bladder) was also 360 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 found in urothelial cells from a worker with known occupational exposure to 
MOCA. 
• An increased frequency of sister chroma tid exchange and micronuclei was seen 
in urothelial cells and lymphocytes of workers exposed to MOCA.

1.1.4  Technical products and impurities 
The commercial product contains several  polycyclic hydrocarbons including 
dibenzo( a,h)phenazine, which is formed from 2-naphthylamine in the presence of air. 
2-Amino-1,4-naphthoquinone- N4,2-naphthylimine has also  been reported as a 
contaminant of 2-naph thylamine (Radomski et al. , 1971). NH 2370 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Trade names for 2-naphthylamine include Fast Scarlet Base B. 
1.1.5  Analysis 
Analyses of 2-naphthylamine were first repor ted in the 1960s. Hi storically, water, 
urine, and textile samples have been anal ysed for 2-naphthylamine content with gas 
chromatography (GC) and liquid chroma tography-mass spectrome try (LC-MS). These 
methods permit detection at concentrations down  to the ng/L level. Recent studies involve 
the use of GC/MS to determine the concentrations of 2-naphthylamine (in derivative form) in cigarette smoke and in the urine of  smokers. Table 1.1 presents selected recent 
studies of the analysis of 2-na phthylamine in various matrices. 
1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
2-Naphthylamine was commercially produced in the US from the early 1920s to the 
early 1970s. In 1955 (the latest year for which production data were found), 581 000 kg 
(1.3 million pounds) were produced (IARC, 1974). Since its commercial manufacture and 
use in the US were banned in  the early 1970s, 2-naphthylamin e has been available only in 
small quantities for laboratory research. 
According to EU legislation, the production, manufacture and use of 2-naphthylamine 
has been prohibited since 1998 (European Commission, 1998). 
Available information indicates that 2-naph thylamine was produced and/or supplied 
in research quantities in the following countr ies: Belgium, Germany,  Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, the People’s Republic of China, Switzerland, and the USA (Chemical Sources International, 2010) 
1.2.2  Use 
2-Naphthylamine is now used only in labo ratory research. It formerly was used 
commercially as an intermedia te in the manufacture of dyes,  as an antioxidant in the 
rubber industry, and to produce 2-chloronaphthylamine (IARC, 1974; HSDB, 2003). 
1.3 Occurrence 
1.3.1  Natural and environmental occurrence 
2-Naphthylamine is formed during the pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing organic 
matter and can occur as such in nature (Masuda et al.,1967; Talukder & Kates, 2000).  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 371

2-Naphthylamine may occur in the waste streams from plants where it is produced 
and used; it has been reported to be present in the effluent from certain dyestuff factories 
in Japan (Takemura et al. , 1965). 
1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
Occupational exposure to 2-naphthylamine (2-NA) mainly occurs during its 
production and when used in the manufacture of azo dyes. Occupational exposure to 2-NA can also occur in laboratories where it is used for research purposes, and when 
workers are exposed to pyro lysis fumes containing 2-NA  (e.g., foundry fumes, 
environmental tobacco smoke, heated cookin g oils), or to 2-ni tronaphthalene (e.g., 
foundry workers), a nitro-PAH th at can be metabolized to 2- NA. Exposure can also occur 
in workers exposed to products containing 2- NA as a contaminant, such as certain rubber 
chemicals. 
Subjects reported to have been exposed to 2-NA during its production include 
workers from Italy (Rubino et al. , 1982), Japan (Tsuchiya et al. , 1975; Morinaga et al. , 
1982), the Russian Federation (Bulbulyan et al. , 1995), the United  Kingdom (Case & 
Pearson, 1954) and the USA (Schulte et al. , 1986; Cassidy et al. , 2003). 
Exposure measurement data were reported for a dye factory that manufactured 2-NA 
and benzidine in Moscow (Bulbulyan et al. , 1995). 2-NA levels in factory-air samples 
taken between 1939 and 1948 ranged from < 0.001 mg/L to > 0.003 mg/L. Factory-wall 
wipes contained 60.0–115 mg/m
2 wall surface. Dermal wipes taken after a shower at 
work showed amounts of 2-NA between 0. 018–37.5 mg [data on th e skin surface-area 
were not available]. 
In a study among a group of workers in Germany primarily exposed to aniline and 
4-chloroaniline, urinary 2-NA concentrations ranged between 0–9.8 µg/L (mean 3.9±2.2) in 22 smokers and between 0.0–11.6 µg/L (mean 2.1±2.8) in 21 nonsmokers; levels 
measured in non-smoking non-exposed workers were 0.0–1.6 µg/L (mean 0.5±0.7). No 
difference was observed between slow and fast acetylators amon g smokers or non-
smokers (Riffelmann et al., 1995). 
In a study in two Danish iron foundries, 2-NA was proposed as a possible marker of 
2-nitronaphthalene in the urine of PAH-exposed workers (Hansen et al. , 1994). The 
concentrations of 2-NA in urine were significantly higher in PAH-exposed workers 
compared with controls (matched for smoking habits), with hand moulders, finishing 
workers and truck drivers having the highest levels. This may be explained by the presence of 2-nitronaphthalene (which can be metabolized to 2-NA), of aromatic amines 
(e.g., in moulding sand) or of nitrogen oxides (e.g., in diesel exhaust). A study of 19 
human volunteers showed that up to  0.03% of a single 10-mg dose of N-phenyl-2-
naphthylamine is converted internally to 2- naphthylamine (IARC, 1978). More recently, 
it has been estimated that a maximum of 1% of total N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine uptake 
can be metabolized into 2-NA (Weiss et al. , 2007).  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 373  
 1.3.3  Occurrence as an impurity in other compounds 
Several dye intermediates have been shown to contain small amounts of 2-naphthyl-
amine. 2-NA concentrations of up to 0.5% have been reported in commercially produced 
1-naphthylamine (substance profile). A 4% contamination level has been reported in 1-NA produced in Japan, which after 1970  was reduced to less than 1% (Tsuchiya et al. , 
1975). 2-NA has also been de tected in 6-amino-2-naphthal ene sulfonic acid (Bronner’s 
acid) (Cassidy et al. , 2003), a pigment intermediate, as well as in auramine. 
2-NA has been detected in hair dyes. A study from Turkey showed 2-NA in 20 out of 
54 hair dyes and in 15 out of 25 hennas, in concentrations up to 5.47 and 4.15 μg/g 
respectively (Akyüz & Ata, 2008). [The Working Group noted that the hair dyes analysed in this study are not necessarily representativ e of hair dyes used in other countries]. 
2-NA has been detected in rubber antioxi dants such as Nonox S and Agerite Resin at 
levels of 0.25% [2500 ppm] (Veys, 2004). N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, also a rubber 
antioxidant, can be contaminat ed with 2-NA, and can also be metabolized (dephenylated) 
into 2-NA to some extent. 
In a polyethylene pipe manu facturing plant in the USA,  contamination of a resin 
additive with 2-NA was detected  in 1996, which may have resulted in worker exposure to 
2-NA from 1970 to 1996 (Felknor et al. , 2003). 
1.3.4  Exposure of the general population 
The general population can be exposed to 2-NA through environmental exposure, via 
tobacco smoke, via other fumes containing 2- NA, or when in contact with dyes and hair 
dyes contaminated with 2-NA. Exposure to the nitro-PAH 2-nitronaphthalene, which is 
formed by incomplete combustion of organic material and generally occurs in the 
environment as a mixture of other nitro-P AH and non-nitro-PAH compounds, can also 
represent an indirect source of exposure to 2-NA. 
Mainstream cigarette-smoke from eight diff erent US conventional market cigarettes 
contained 2-naphthylamine at concentrations of 1.47 to 14.06 ng per cigarette (Stabbert et al. , 2003). Amounts in mainstream cigarette-smoke range from 1–22 ng per cigarette 
(IARC, 2004), those in sidestream cigarette -smoke range from 113.5–171.6 ng per 
cigarette (IARC, 2004). 
In a study from Germany (Riffelmann et al ., 1995), urinary concentrations were 
higher in smokers (3100 ng/L±2100; n = 8) compared with no n-smokers (500 ng/L±700; 
n = 8). [The Working Group noted that the very high levels reported are likely due to the 
unspecific detection by the GC-EC method used (Riedel et al., 2006)]. In a later German 
study (Grimmer et al. , 2000), freebase 2-NA was found at comparable levels in the urine 
of non-smokers (120.8 ng/24 hours), of smoke rs (84.5 ng/24 hours) and of individuals 
exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (94.9 ng/24 hours). In a study by Riedel et al.  
(2006), smokers ( n = 10) excreted significantly higher amounts of 2-NA compared with 
nonsmokers ( n = 10) (20.8 vs 10.7 ng/24 hours). 374 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 1.4 Regulations and guidelines 
1.4.1  Europe 
(a) Council Directive 89/677/EEC 
According to Council Directive 89/677/EEC , 2-naphthylamine and its salts may not 
be used in concentrations equal to or greater than 0.1% by weight in substances and preparations placed on the market (E uropean Economic Community, 1989). 
(b) Council Directive 98/24/EC 
According to EU regulations, the manufacture and use of 2-naphthylamine has been 
prohibited since 1998 (European Commission, 1998). The Council Directive 98/24/EC in 
Annex III prohibits the production, manufacture or use at work of 2-naphthylamine and 
its salts and activities involving 2-naphthylam ine and its salts. The prohibition does not 
apply if 2-naphthylamine is present in anothe r chemical agent, or as a constituent of 
waste, provided that its i ndividual concentration therei n is less than 0.1% w/w. 
(c) Council Directive 2002/61/EC 
Directive 2002/61/EC restricts the marke ting and use of azocolourants (European 
Commission, 2002). In this Directive, A nnex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is amended. 
Azodyes which, by reductive cleavage of  one or more azo groups, may release 
2-naphthylamine in detectable concentrations, i.e. above 30 ppm in the finished articles or 
in the dyed parts thereof, ac cording to the testing method  established in accordance with 
Article 2a of this Directive, may not be used in textile and leather articles that may come into direct and prolonged contact wi th the human skin or oral cavity. 
(d) Directive 2004/37/EC 
2-Naphthylamine is regulated by the Directive 2004/37/EC (European Commission, 
2004a), which applies to activities in which workers are exposed to carcinogens or 
mutagens of Category 1 and 2. Rules are fixed regarding the employers' obligations of 
reduction and replacement, prevention and re duction of exposure, unforeseen exposure, 
foreseeable exposure, access to risk areas, hygien e and individual prot ection, information 
for the competent authority, information and training of  workers, consultation and 
participation of workers, health surveillance, record keeping and limit values. 
(e) Directive 2004/93/EC 
The Commission Directive 2 004/93/EC of 21 September 2004 amends the Council 
Directive 76/768/EEC for the purpose of adap ting Annexes II and III thereto to technical 
progress (European Commission, 200 4b). In this Directive, 2- naphthylamine and its salts 
are listed in Annex II  as substances that must not form part of the composition of cosmetic 
products.  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 375  
 (f) Directive 2005/90/EC 
In the Directive 2005/90/EC, the list in  Directive 76/769/EEC of substances classified 
as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction was amended to include 2-naphthylamine (European Commission, 2005). 
1.4.2  Germany 
2-Naphthylamine is classified as a Categor y 1 carcinogen by the MAK Commission. 
The MAK Commission listed 2-naphthylamine as a substance for which percutaneous 
absorption may significantly contribute to systemic exposure. A MAK value was not set 
(MAK, 2007). 
1.4.3  Japan 
The Japan Society for Occupational Health  (2007) follows the classification by IARC 
of 2-naphthylamine in Group 1. 
1.4.4  USA 
(a) ACGIH 
2-Naphthylamine has been assigned an A1 notation, Confirmed Human Carcinogen  
(ACGIH, 2001). Accordingly, a numerical  TLV (threshold limit-value) is not 
recommended for occupational exposure. As  for all substances designated as A1 
carcinogens without a TLV, wo rkers should be properly equipped to eliminate all 
exposure to 2-naphthylamine to  the fullest extent possible. 
(b) NIOSH 
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH, 2005) lists 
2-naphthylamine as one of 13 OSHA-regulated carcinogens. Exposures of workers are to 
be controlled through the required use of engineering controls, work practices, and 
personal protective equipment, including respirators. 
(c) NTP 
2-Naphthylamine is listed in the NTP Report on Carcinogens as known to be a human 
carcinogen  (NTP, 2005).

2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
Cancer risk related to exposure to 2- naphthylamine has been assessed in several 
cohort studies and case reports. In spite of the fact that, in gene ral, production ceased 
several decades ago, follow-ups were con tinuously updated until very recent dates. 
2.1 Case reports, case series 
Several reports from the 1960s and 1970s  described cases of bladder cancer among 
workers exposed to 2-naphthyl amine in France (Billiard-Duch esne, 1960), Italy (Vigliani 
& Barsotti, 1962) and Japan (Tsuji, 1962, Tsuchiya et al.  1975) 
Goldwater et al.  (1965) found that the cumulative incidence of bladder cancer among 
British coal-tar dye workers exposed to 2- naphthylamine, and not to other aromatic 
amines, was 25% (12 cases among 48 exposed workers). 
In another study from Japan, 112 cases of recognized occupational bladder cancer 
(10.3%) were found among 1085 workers employed in the synthesis and handling of 2-naphthylamine and/or benzidine (Nakamura et al. , 1980; Shinka et al.,  1991). 
Hashmi et al.,  (1995) found that among 250 consecutive bladder-cancer patients 
admitted to the Dow Medical College in Karachi, Pakistan, three had been exposed to 2-naphthylamine. 
In a group of 438 persons engaged in the production of aromatic amines, including 
2-naphthylamine, in Japan, 88 (20%) de veloped uroepithelial cancer (Hamasaki et al. , 
1996).  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 377  
 [The studies listed above represent a mere sample of many case series spanning four 
decades.] 
In addition to the case series presented abov e, three screening programmes detected 
cases of bladder cancer among workers exposed to 2-naphthylamine. These were the 
DuPont Chambers Works programme (Mason et al. , 1986, 1992; Mason & Vogler, 
1990), the Drake programme (Marsh and C assidy 2003) and the scr eening programme of 
a dyestuff plant in Tokyo, Japan (Miyakawa et al. , 2001). [The Working Group raised 
concerns about the validity of the resu lts of these screening programmes as far as it 
concerns etiological research with a substantia l potential for detection bias and because no 
measure of effect is available relating β-naphthylamine exposure to cancer.] 
2.2 Cohort studies 
One of the first studies to review cases of  bladder cancer among workers exposed to 
2-naphthylamine was that of Case et al.  (1954), who reviewed 341 cases of bladder 
cancer of a total of 455 occurring in employ ees of participating firms in the British 
chemical industry who had been exposed to 2-naphthylamin e only. There were 26 cases 
of bladder cancer mentioned on the death certificate, where only 0.3 would have been 
expected from the overall male population of England and Wales ( P < 0.001). The mean 
induction period was 16 years. 
Mancuso & el Attar (1967) followed a coho rt of 639 male workers employed in a 
company manufacturing 2-naphthylamine and benzidine in Ohio (USA) for 27 years (1938–1965), with respect to cause-specific mortality. B ased on 14 cases, the observed 
mortality rate for bladder cancer was elevated  when compared with that expected for the 
population of Ohio (78/100 000 vs 4.4/100 000). Among white men, all cases occurred 
among the “exposed” group. There was an underreporting of cases of bladder cancer on 
the death certificates. The “attack  rate”, taking together those who had died and those who 
were living with bladder neoplasms, for those exposed to 2-naphthylamine was 952/100 000. Based on six cases, the morta lity rate for pancreatic cancer was also 
elevated (39/100 000 vs 7.5/100 000). 
Veys (1969, 2004) followed a cohort of male workers employed in the British rubber 
industry with respect to bladder-cancer morbidity and mortality. Among these workers, 
2090 were considered likely to be exposed to 2-naphthylamine, as they were employed 
between 1945 and 1949, while 3038 workers who started their employment after 1950 were considered to be not exposed to 2-naph thylamine. For morbidit y, 58 bladder cancers 
were identified in the first group, while 33.9 were expected according to national 
standardized incidence rates (SIR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3–2.2). In the second group, 39 cases 
were traced while 38.3 were expected (S IR, 1.0; 95% CI 0.7–1.4). Bladder-cancer 
mortality data from the same cohort did not s how an increased risk (SMR, 1.0; 95% CI,  
0.60–1.6); in only 16 of the 46 deceased was bladder cancer certified as the underlying 
cause of death. 378 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Morinaga et al.  (1982) ascertained the incidence of second primary cancers among 
3322 workers exposed to 2-naphthylamine and benzidine during 1950–1978 in Japan. Among these workers, 244 had previously had genito-urinary cancer. Within this 
subgroup, 11 male workers developed subsequent cancers of the liver, gallbladder, bile 
duct, large intestine and lung. Compared with  a control group of 177 male bladder-cancer 
patients, the excess occurrence of liver, gallbla dder and bile-duct cancer was statistically 
significant ( P < 0.05). One case of maxillary si nus cancer occurred in a worker 
exclusively exposed to 2-naph thylamine and one case of prostate cancer occurred in a 
worker exposed to both 2-naphthylamine and benzidine. The nine remaining cases 
appeared in workers exposed to benzidine.  
Piolatto et al.  (1991) carried out a cohort study among 906 dyestuff workers in Turin, 
Northern Italy, who were employed for ≥ 1 year between 1922 and 1970 and followed-up 
through 1989. Causes of death were ascertain ed through death cer tificates. Overall, 
49 bladder-cancer cases were observed, while  1.6 were expected (SMR, 30.4; 95% CI, 
23.0–40.2) Results were stratified by specifi c employment in the plant. Among those 
involved in manufacturing of naphthylamine or benzidine, the SMR for bladder cancer 
was 142.11 (27 deaths; 95%  CI, 97.5–207.2) (Decarli et al. , 1985). Those who used 
naphthylamines or benzidine showed an SMR of 16.7 (three deaths; 95% CI, 5.4–51.7). 
An earlier study of the same cohort prov ided results specific to exposure during 
2-naphthylamine manufacture; the SMR for bladder cancer was 150 (95% CI, 67.4–
333.9) based on six cases (Rubino et al. , 1982). 
A cohort study in the USA included 1384 workers employed between 1940 and 1972 
in a chemical plant in Georgia manufacturing and using 2-naphthylamine and other aromatic amines. The cohort was followed-up until 1992. The initial cohort comprised 
approximately 70 female wo rkers, but these were exclude d from the mortality study 
because they were generally not employ ed in jobs involving exposure to 
2-naphthylamine. The vital status at the end of follow-up was determined by use of the 
National Death Index and US postal service data. Incident cases of bladder cancer were 
identified by community neurologists and a bladder-cancer screening programme. The 
mortality experience of the cohort was co mpared with that of the US and Georgia 
populations. The SMR corresponding to bladder cancer as underlying cause of death was 
2.4 (three deaths; 95% CI, 0.5–7.0) and that corresponding to bladder cancer as listed anywhere on the death certificate was 5.6 (eig ht deaths; 95% CI, 2.4–11.1). There was 
also an excess of deaths for esophageal can cer (seven deaths; SMR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.8–
4.1), lung cancer (41 deaths; SMR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.20–2.3), and prostate cancer (11 deaths; SMR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1–3.8) (Schulte et al. , 1985, 1986; Stern et al. , 1985; Axtell 
et al. , 1998). 
Delzell et al.  (1989) followed a cohort of 2642  men employed at a dye- and resin-
manufacturing plant in New Jersey (USA) from the opening of the plant in 1952 through 
1988. Data on work history were obtained th rough several independent sets of records. A 
subcohort of 89 men who had previously worked in a chemical plant that produced benzidine and 2-naphthylamine showed an excess of total cancer deaths based on  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 379  
 17 cases (SMR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.16–3.18). Th is excess was due essentially to bladder 
cancer (three cases observed, 0.25 expected; SM R, 12; 95% CI, 3.9–37.2), kidney cancer 
(two cases observed, 0.21 expected; SMR, 9.52 ; 95% CI, 2.4–38.1) and tumours of the 
central nervous system (two cases observed, 0. 22 expected; SMR, 9. 1; 95% CI, 2.3–36.3). 
Morinaga et al.  (1990) followed from 1970 to 1986 a cohort of 604 workers from two 
factories in Osaka (Japan) that produced 2- naphthylamine and benzidine in the period 
1945–1971. The causes of death of these workers were co mpared with those expected 
based on the mortality of the Osaka populati on. Those who had been exposed exclusively 
to 2-naphthylamine showed a significant increase in urinary cancer (two cases observed; 
SMR, 11.76; 95% CI, 2.9–47.0). Those exposed to both 2-naphthylamine and benzidine 
had a higher risk with two cases observed (SMR, 25.00; 95% CI , 6.3–100.0). The 
increase in risk for other ca ncers (liver and lung) was no t statistically significant. 
Szeszenia-Dabrowska et al.  (1991) conducted a cohort study among 6978 male 
workers employed in the rubber industry in Poland for at l east three months during 1945 
to 1973 and followed-up th rough 1985. These workers were  predominantly engaged in 
rubber footwear manufacture. A total of 299 d eaths from cancer were registered in the 
cohort (SMR, 112.7; 95% CI , 100.6–126.2). Bladder cancer  was significantly increased 
for workers employed between 1945 and 1953, when 2-naphthylamine was used (six 
deaths; SMR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.24–6.14). 
Bulbulyan et al.  (1995) evaluated cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of 4581 
aniline-dye production workers (2409 men and 2172 women) in Moscow, exposed to 2-
naphthylamine or benzidine during ≥ 1 month, or employed during > 2 years, with a 
follow-up time of 15 years, from Janua ry 1975 to December 1989. Cases were 
ascertained through oncology registries that we re available in the 33 Moscow regions. Job 
history for up to four jobs per person w as ascertained through employment records. 
Incidence and mortality for sever al cancer sites were determined  with regard to exposure 
to 2-naphthylamine and benzidine. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated by 
comparison with the Moscow general popu lation. For workers ever exposed to 
2-naphthylamine, the inciden ce of bladder cancer was significantly increased for those 
employed > 3 years (eight cases; SIR, 19.5 ; 95% CI, 8.4–38.5). There was a positive 
exposure-response relationship with years worked ( P = 0.07); those who were first 
employed before the age of 20 showed a la rger increase in risk (four cases; SIR, 49.4; 
95% CI, 13.3–126.3) than those hired at later ages ( p for trend = 0.04). 
Naito et al.  (1995) followed a cohort of 442 dy estuff workers in an urban area in 
Japan from date of entry (1935–1988) through 1992, on average for 39 years. The SMR for bladder cancer for those exposed to 2-naphthylamine was 48.4 (three deaths; 95% CI, 
10.0–141.5). The SMR risk for all sites w as 1.9 (nine deaths; 95% CI, 0.9–3.7) for 
2-naphthylamine manufacture and 0.4 (2 deaths; 95% CI, 0.1–1.4) for 2-naphthylamine use. In addition to mortality, the authors reported on the incidence by periodic urologic 
screenings. The adjusted incidence rate of ur othelial carcinoma increased with duration of 
exposure during 2-naphthylamine manufacture. 380 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 The Drake Health Registry Study provides for bladder-cancer screening of all former 
employees of the Drake Chemical Co. (Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, USA). The company and its predecessors produced 2-naphthylamin e as a main product from 1940 until 1962 
and possibly as a residual contaminant through  1981, when the plan t was closed. Based 
on the Drake Health Registry, a cohort study was conducted among 400 workers (374 men, 26 women) with sufficient data for analysis. Causes of death were determined 
through the National Death Index and death certificates. The mortality experience of the 
cohort from 1960 to 1998 was examined, and expected numbers of deaths were computed 
with the US population and the local area population as a st andard. For all cancers, based 
on 28 deaths, the SMR was 3.1 (95% CI, 2.1–4.5). For bladder cancer, the SMR was 16.8 
(95% CI, 4.6–43.1) based on fo ur deaths. For cancer of the respiratory system, based on 
12 deaths, the SMR was 3.9 (95% CI, 2.0–6.8) (Cassidy et al. , 2003). Two decades earlier 
in an ecological study, Budnick et al.  (1984) had analysed age- , sex-, and race-adjusted 
cancer-mortality rates for th e county where the plant w as located, and reported a 
statistically significant increase in  bladder cancer among white men. 
3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
3.1 Oral administration 
3.1.1  Mouse 
A group of 13 male and 12 female IF mi ce, weighing 25 g, were given 5 mg of 
2-naphthylamine (BDH; purified by distillation and crystallization) in arachis oil via stomach tube twice weekly at a dose of 4 00 mg/kg bw per week for life (90 weeks). A 
group of six males and five females served as arachis-oil controls. Liver cholangiomas 
were observed in 5/13 (38%) male and 5/12 female (41%) mice. No tumours were observed in control animals (Bonser et al. , 1952). 
Groups of nine male and 14 female CBA mice, weighing 30 to 35 g (age not 
specified) were given five mg 2-naphthylamine (BHD; purified by distillation and crystallization) in arachis oil by gavage, twice weekly for a weekly dose of 240 mg/kg bw 
for life (90 weeks). A group of seven male and seven female mice served as arachis-oil 
controls. Hepatomas were observed in 6/9 males (67%) and 7/14 females (50%). No tumours were observed in the control animal s. The authors reported the incidence of 
hepatomas in the control breeding mice of the laboratory to be 8% (Bonser et al. , 1952). 
Groups of 14–15 male and 12–15 female CBA mice (weight and age not given) were 
fed four different synthetic diets containing 2-naphthylamine (concentration not specified) 
for a dose of 160 mg/kg bw per week for 90 weeks. No information on use of controls 
was provided. Hepatomas occurred at similar in cidences in all four diet groups, with a 
total of 24/57 (42%) hepatomas observed in males and 25/54 (46%) in females. The  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 381  
 authors reported that malignant hepatomas we re found in 16 mice (sex not specified) 
(Bonser et al. , 1952). [The Working Group noted the lack of controls.]  
Groups of 20 female BALB/c mice, eight weeks of age, were fed a diet containing 
2000 ppm 2-naphthylamine [purity not specified] for 40 weeks, followed  by basal diet for 
15 weeks. At 55 weeks, hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium was seen in 6 of 16 (37%) 
surviving mice. In the livers of these mice, hyperplastic nodules we re seen in 14 animals 
(87%), adenomas in 10 (62%) and hepatomas in three (19%) (Yoshida et al. , 1979). 
A group of 16 female and 16 male A/ J mice, 6–8 weeks of age, received 
2-naphthylamine in tricaprylin by gavage three times per week for eight weeks, resulting 
in a total dose per animal of 600 mg/kg bw. At 24 weeks, 8 of 14 (57%) male and 4 of 13 
(31%) female survivors had lung tumours. This was not significantly different from the lung tumour rate in the vehi cle controls. Tumour multiplic ity was significantly increased 
in male mice (0.93 ± 1.00 vs 0.27 ± 0.59; P < 0.05) (Stoner et al. , 1986). 
3.1.2  Rat 
A group of 18 male, 29 female and three unknown albino rats were fed 0.01% 
2-naphthylamine [purity unspecified] in the diet for life; this resulted in four bladder papillomas among 50 rats that survived for up  to 102 weeks. No car cinomas were seen in 
the treated group. There were no tumours observed in the 43 controls fed an untreated diet 
(Bonser et al. , 1952). 
Oral administration by gavage of 0.5–150 mg 2-naphthylamine [purity unspecified] 
per week to rats for 52 weeks, followed by an  observation period until up to 80 weeks did 
not result in a significant increase in tum ours compared with controls (Hadidian et al. , 
1968). 
A group of 25 female Wistar rats, 6–8 weeks of age, received 2-naphthylamine 
[purity unspecified] suspended in arachis oil by  stomach tube at a dose rate of 300 mg/kg 
bw per week for one year, and were then ke pt until symptoms of bladder disease were 
seen. A group of 55 males and females served as controls. The first tumour appeared at 
57 weeks. Histology indicated that five of  17 (29%) animals showed the presence of 
bladder tumours. Three animals were reported  to be “still alive” (Hicks & Chowaniec, 
1977). 
A group of 20 female Wistar rats, 10 weeks of age, received 2-naphthylamine (purity 
not specified) at a dose of 300 mg/kg bw in ar achis oil by gastric intubation once a week 
for 57 weeks. Animals were killed when mo ribund, or after 100 weeks. A group of 
20 animals served as arachis-oil controls. Nine teen animals survived 57 weeks or longer. 
The bladders of 18 rats were examined histologically: eight of 18 (44%) had urothelial 
hyperplasia, and four of these eight had also carcinomas (Hicks et al. , 1982). 382 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 3.1.3  Hamster 
A group of 30 male and 30 female Syrian golden hamsters, nine weeks of age, 
received 1% or 0.1% (w/w) 2-naphthylamine (p urity unspecified) in the diet for life. The 
estimated intake was 600 mg 2-naphthylam ine/week. Bladder carcinomas were observed 
in 10/23 (43%) effective males and in 8/16 (5 0%) effective females treated with the 1% 
concentration, with the first tumours appearin g after 45 weeks. One male and one female 
hamster also developed hepatomas. Dietary concentrations of 0.1% did not produce carcinomas in 60 animals after 97 weeks. Repeated administration of the chemical by 
gavage (10 mg, twice weekly for 40 weeks) did not produce any tumours. In two control 
groups of 60 and 40 animals, fed the diet only, no bladder carcinomas were observed (Saffiotti et al. , 1967). 
3.1.4  Rabbit 
Oral doses (200 mg, twice weekly) of 2-naph thylamine (purity unspecified) given to 
six rabbits (age and sex unspecified) for more than five years induced a transitional-cell 
bladder papilloma at 4.75 years in one animal, and epithelial hyperplasia with downgrowth in the bladder in another after 5.25 years (Bonser et al. , 1952). 
3.1.5  Dog 
A group of 16 medium-sized to large female mongrel dogs, weighing 8–20 kg, 
received daily subcutaneous injections of commercial 2-naphthyl amine (4 mg/day for 
dogs ≤ 12 kg: 5 mg/day for larger dogs) for 14 weeks. The dose was doubled during the 
next 12 weeks and tripled during the subseque nt 63 weeks. During the last 54 weeks of 
this period, the dogs also received a daily dose of 2-naphthylamine (by capsule) in the 
food. The number of dogs on this dual regi men was gradually increased, as was the oral 
dose (starting with 100 mg/day). By the time the subcutaneous injections were 
terminated, all dogs received a daily oral dose of 300 mg of 2-naphthylamine. During the 
first five months of this experimental pe riod, eight dogs received sodium bicarbonate 
(100 mg/kg bw) to alkalinize the urine. Four control dogs received no treatment. Over a 
total treatment period of 20–26 months, 13 of the 16 (81%) dogs had developed 
papillomas and carcinomas in the bladder (Hueper et al. , 1938). [This ev idence was based 
partly on autopsy and partly on cystoscopy and biopsy.] 
A group of four medium-sized mongrel Airedale dogs (one female and three males) 
received 2-naphthylamine (BDH; purified by distillation and crysta llization) at 150 mg 
per day in milk for three weeks. The dose was then reduced to 100 mg/day (for an 
unspecified period). The dose was gradually in creased to 700 mg per day after the end of 
the first year. One male dog died after one y ear of treatment. Multiple papillomas in the 
bladder were seen in the thr ee other dogs after 3.7–5 years of treatment. In one animal, 
one anaplastic carcinoma was found. There were no metastases, and the renal pelves, 
ureters and urethra were tumour-free, as were all other organs (Bonser, 1943).  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 383  
 A group of four female mongrel dogs received 200 mg 2-naphthylamine (purity 
unspecified) orally in a gelatin capsule on six days per week for six months. The daily 
dose was then increased to 600 mg and cont inued for up to two years. The maximum 
cumulative dose of 2-naphthylamine given to a dog was 310 g. One dog died after 
14.5 months of treatment without neoplastic changes in the bladder. Another dog received 2-naphthylamine for one year and was killed nine months later with no neoplastic changes 
in the bladder epithelium. Multiple transi tional-cell tumours, some of which were 
histologically malignant, were seen in the bladder of the remaining two dogs. One of 
these died after two years of treatment; the other was killed one year later. The latter dog 
had developed an invasive bladder carcinoma (Bonser et al. , 1956a). 
A group of four female mongrel dogs, each  weighing 12–14 kg, were fed 400 mg 
2-naphthylamine [purity unspecified] daily for two years. Bladder tumours were noted 
and confirmed by microscopic examination of biopsy sections in all four animals within 
9–18 months after the start of the expe riment. The dogs received intravenous and 
intracavitary therapy with 5- fluorouracil, whereupon transient tumour regression was 
observed. All dogs were then kept on standard diet and followed for 23 to 55 additional 
months until death or sacrifice. Metastases of the bladder carcinomas were seen in the 
lungs of two dogs and in the kidney in one (Harrison et al. , 1969). 
A group of 34 beagle dogs, 8–10 months of age, received 2-naphthylamine [purity 
unspecified] mixed with lactose, orally in ge latin capsules on 6 days per week in doses of 
6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg bw (dose groups A, B, C, D) per day for 2–26 months. Two 
male and two female control dogs received cap sules with lactose only . Within 30 months, 
bladder tumours were induced across all dose groups in 24/34 (70%) dogs: invasive transitional-cell carcinomas were seen in two dogs each in dose groups A, B, and D, and 
in five dogs in dose group C; invasive squamous-cell carcinomas were observed in one, 
two, three and two dogs in dose groups A, B,  C and D, respectively;  papillary carcinomas 
were noted in one, three and four dogs in dose groups B, C and D, respectively. Overall, 
carcinomas were present in 9/11 (81%) dogs  that had received a total of 100–200 g 
2-naphthylamine and in 6/23 (26%) dogs receivi ng a total amount of < 100 g. No tumours 
were seen in the controls. The total amount of 2-naphthylamine required for tumour 
induction was less for dose gr oup A after 24–30 months th an for dose groups C and D 
after 9–18 months (Conzelman & Moulton 1972). 
In a study designed to investigate the morphology of 2-naphthylamine-induced 
bladder tumours, eight female dogs, weighing 18–30 kg, were treated with 2-
naphthylamine (5–30 mg/kg bw, 4–6 days per week, for 7.5 months and 30 mg/kg bw, 4–6 days per week, for 8.5 months). After 55 months since the beginning of the experiment, 
bladder carcinomas developed in seven (87%) animals (Romanenko & Martynenko, 
1972). 
A group of 15 female dogs, weighing 16–22  kg, received an oral capsule containing 
500–600 mg 2-naphthylamine [purity not specified] daily for 20–26 months. All dogs had 
haematuria, and all developed bladder carcinoma (Rigotti et al. , 1977). 384 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Eight female pure-bred beagle dogs were  given a daily dose of 2-naphthylamine 
(5 mg/kg bw; source and purity not specified; route of administration not given) for 30 days. Four dogs then started on a daily supplement of 6 g 
D,L-tryptophan admixed into 
300 g dog chow during the rest of the experiment. The other four dogs were kept on 
standard diet. Four additional dogs received only the dietary supplement but no 2-naphthylamine. After three years, all 12 dogs were killed and the bladders were 
examined grossly and by hi stology. The bladders of dogs that received only 
2-naphthylamine showed no abnormal effects. The dogs that were given tryptophan with 2-naphthylamine showed gross and histological  changes, such as papillary tumours and 
epithelial hyperplasia. The bladder muco sa of dogs given tryptophan alone showed 
similar hyperplastic changes (Radomski et al. , 1977). 
Five male purebred beagle dogs received capsules with 2-naphth ylamine in corn oil 
orally in doses of 25 mg/kg bw, daily on fi ve days per week for 26 weeks. In a second 
experiment, groups of four dogs (two females, two males) were similarly treated for one, six or 36 weeks, then promptly killed. In a third experiment, eight dogs (four females, 
four males) were treated with the same regimen for 26 weeks, then four dogs were killed 
and the others kept without further treatment for three years. Loss of bladder luminal membrane, hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium, and lymphocyte infiltration of the 
submucosa were seen after one and six weeks of  treatment in some dogs, and to a more 
severe degree after 36 weeks of treatment in all dogs. Two of the four dogs that were kept 
for three years after a 26-week treatment peri od had papillary carcinomas of the bladder 
(Rdomski et al., 1978). 
A group of two female and three male beagle dogs, approximately nine months of 
age, received 400 mg pure 2-naphthylamine da ily on five days per week for 34 months. 
The chemicals were given as tablets enclosed in a gelatin capsule. Control dogs (four 
males and four females) received capsules with lactose. All treated dogs developed transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder within 34 months. No neoplasia of the bladder 
was found in the controls (Purchase et al. , 1981). 
3.1.6  Monkey 
Twenty-four young male and female rhesus monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ; weighing 2–
3 kg) received 2-naphthylamine mi xed with lactose, orally in gelatin capsules on six days 
per week in doses of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 1 00, 200, and 400 mg/kg bw per day for 33–
60 months. Some animals received a fixed do se during the entire experiment; others 
received different doses over the course of five  years. Papillary carcinoma, transitional-
cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ were obser ved in the bladder of nine treated monkeys, 
the earliest of these tumours a ppearing after 33 m onths. The majority of tumours occurred 
in animals given high doses of 2-naphthylamine. No other types of tumour were observed, and no tumours occurred in three control monkeys (Conzelman et al.  1969).  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 385  
 3.2 Subcutaneous or intra-peritoneal injection 
3.2.1  Mouse 
Swiss albino mice, approximatel y 12 weeks of age, received 0.1 ml of a freshly made 
3% solution of 2-naphthylamine (BDH; purified by distillation and crystallization) in arachis oil by subcutaneous injection, tw ice weekly for 50 weeks. None of 13 mice 
surviving 33 week s of treatment had subcutaneous sar comas; two of four mice (50%; all 
females) surviving > 77 weeks had hepa tomas. In a similar experiment with 
2-naphthylamine (RCH; purified by gradient  sublimation), local subcutaneous sarcomas 
were seen in two of 12 mice (17%; at 37 and 41 weeks, respectively) and one hepatoma at 
52 weeks. When a 3% solution of 2-naphthylamine (BDH; purified by distillation and crystallization) was allowed to stand for four weeks and injected subcutaneously into 
Swiss albino mice (0.1 ml per mouse; twice weekly for 50 weeks), 10 of 16 (62%) mice 
that survived ≥ 20 weeks had subcutaneous injection-site sarcomas, and four of five 
(80%) mice that survived ≥ 80 weeks had hepatomas. No sarcomas or hepatomas 
developed in 17 male and female controls treated with arachis oil only (Bonser et al. , 
1956a). 
CBA mice, 12 weeks of age, received 0.1 mL of a freshly made 3% solution of 
2-naphthylamine-HCl (BDH; purified by distillation and crystallization) by subcutaneous 
injection, twice weekly for six months and then once weekly for a further four months. No sarcomas were seen in 11 mice surviving ≥ 56 weeks of treatment, and hepatomas 
were observed in four of 11 (36%) mice dying after 82 weeks. In a similar experiment 
with 2-naphthylamine-HCl purified by gradient sublimation, no subcutaneous sarcomas were seen in ten mice surviving ≥ 58 weeks of treatment, and hepatomas were observed 
in four of 11 (36%) mice dying after 82 weeks. One (7%) hepatoma developed in 15 male 
and female control animals (Bonser et al. , 1956a). 
Groups of 45 male and 45 female mice (from a local dealer, strain and age not 
specified) were given 2-naphthylamine (BDH, purified by distillation and crystallization 
via subcutaneous injection (0.1 mL of a fr eshly prepared or fo ur-week-old 30-mg/ml 
suspension in arachis oil) tw ice weekly for 52 weeks (total dose, 312 mg per mouse). A 
total of 12 mice had subcutaneous sarcomas,  seven mice had hepatomas, and two mice 
had intestinal tumours (one benign, one malignant) (Bonser et al. , 1956b). [The Working 
Group noted the lack of concurrent controls.] 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female inbred A/St mice, 6–8 weeks of age, received 
intraperitoneal injections of 2-naphthylamine in tricaprylin. The injections were given 
three times per week for eight weeks. Doses per injection were 62.5, 125 or 250 mg/kg 
bw. At 24 weeks after the first injection the surviving mice were killed and the lungs were 
excised. The average number of lung tumour s per mouse (1.38 ± 0.30) was statistically 
different ( P < 0.01) from that in the corresponding  solvent control (0.19 ± 0.10) in the 
mice treated with the highest dose of 2-naphth ylamine (total dose 6 g/kg bw). The tumour 
yield in mice treated with 2-naphthylamine was not significantly different from that in the 
controls (Theiss et al. , 1981). 386 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Three groups of 16 females and 16 mal es A/J mice, 6–8 weeks of age, received 
2-naphthylamine (purity not specified) in tricaprylin by intraperitoneal injection three times per week for eight weeks, resulting, resp ectively, in total doses per animal of 120, 
300 and 600 mg/kg bw. At 24 weeks, the incidence of lung tumours varied from 27% to 
47%, which was not significantly different from the lung tumour rate in the vehicle controls (Stoner et al. , 1986). 
A group of 91 newborn BALB/c mice r eceived a single 0.02-mL subcutaneous 
injection containing 50 μg 2-naphthylamine (purity unspecified) in 1% aqueous gelatine 
on the first day of life. Among 71 surviving mice that were killed between the 36
th and 
43rd weeks, 15 (21%) had lung tumours [not significant], and one had a hepatoma. In a 
concurrent control group, 2/21 (10%) mice developed lung tumours (Roe et al. , 1963). 
Twelve groups of 50–60 newborn BALB/c mice received subcutaneous injections of 
100 μg 2-naphthylamine in 20 μL arachis oil once within 24 hours after birth, or once 
daily on the first five days of life. After 40 weeks, the numbers of pulmonary adenomas in 
the surviving mice in the two groups were not statistically different from those in the 
controls. In a second experiment, newborn BALB/c mice (number not specified) received 
subcutaneous injections of 100 μg 2-naphthylamine in 20 μl 3% aqueous gelatin once 
daily on the first five days of life. Surviving mice were killed at 50 weeks of age. Lung 
adenomas were seen in 9/41 (22%) surviving mi ce and in 4/48 (8%) controls, which was 
not significant. No other tumours were found. The failure of 2-naphthylamine to induce tumours in newborn mice was ascribed to immatu rity of their metabolic system (Walters 
et al. , 1967). 
A group of 68 newborn Swi ss mice (sex unspecified) ( n = 68) were given a single 
subcutaneous injection of 30 μL commercial, recrystallized 2-naphthylamine as 3% 
suspension in gelatin [purity unspecified] within 24 hours after birth. Ten months later, 
bronchogenic adenomas were found in six of 63 (10%) autopsied mice [not significant], and no tumours in 57 controls (Radomski et al. , 1971). 
A group of 28 males and 23 females newborn Swiss mice were given subcutaneous 
injections of 30 μL commercial, recrystallized 2-naph thylamine as 3.3-mg/mL suspension 
in 3% gelatin (100 μg per dose) on the first, third and fifth day of life. Twelve months 
later, 2/26 (8%) autopsied male mice had hepatomas, and one of the 21 (5%) autopsied 
females had a lymphosarcoma. Among the controls (20 males, 30 females) one male mouse had a lymphosarcoma (Radomski et al. , 1971). 
3.2.2  Rat 
A group of 16 male Chester Beatty random inbred albino rats, weighing 200 g, 
received intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg /kg bw 2-naphthylamine freshly suspended in 
arachis oil twice weekly for three months. Th ereafter, the rats were maintained until 
tumours were palpable or until death (sur vival period, 123–622 days). Of 14 rats 
examined, three had tumours: two (14%) ha d sarcomas, one (7%) had a salivary gland 
tumour (Boyland et al. , 1963). [The Working Group noted the absence of control rats.]  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 387  
 3.3 Topical application 
3.3.1  Mouse 
A group of twenty-five IF mice (sex not specified), we ighing on average 25 g, 
received a dorsal dose of a saturated solution  of 2-naphthylamine in  benzene (applied by 
skin-painting; no details given) once a week for 99 weeks. No skin tumours or liver 
tumours were found (Bonser et al. , 1952). [The Working group noted the absence of 
control mice.] 
3.4 Intravesicular implantation or instillation 
3.4.1  Mouse 
A group of 89 albino mice received an in travesicular implant of 2-naphthylamine 
(dose unclear) in paraffin wa x. Forty-one mice received th e compound after purification 
as in Bonser (1943), fourty-eight mice were given the compound after purification by gradient sublimation (Henson et al ., 1954). After 40 weeks, eight mice (9%) had 
developed bladder carcinomas, four of which were invasive. This tumour yield was not 
significantly different from that in the control mice implanted with paraffin wax alone, but, according to the authors, the tumours were better establ ished histologically (Bonser 
et al. , 1956c). In contrast, among 74 stock mice that survived 40 weeks after having 
received an intravesicular implant of a stear ic-acid pellet containing 2-naphthylamine 
(dose unclear), no bladder adenomas, papi llomas or carcinomas were found (Boyland 
et al. , 1964). 
3.4.2  Dog 
Four beagle dogs (age and sex unspecified) were given 10 mg commercial 
2-naphthylamine (recrystallized before use)  dissolved in 5 ml DMSO once every two 
weeks for 30 months. The solution was instille d by catheter, directly into the bladder 
lumen. No tumours were seen when the dogs were sacrificed at 45 months (Radomski 
et al. , 1971). 
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination 
4.1.1  Humans 
Because of the known carcinogenicity of 2- naphthylamine in humans, few metabolic 
studies have been carried out. However, N-(2-naphthyl)-hydroxylamine and bis-(2-amino-388 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 1-naphthyl) phosphate have been identified in the urine of some hospital patients given 
small doses of 2-naphthylamine (Troll & Nelson, 1961; Troll et al. , 1963). 
Grimmer et al.  (2000) analysed the amounts of the aromatic amines 1- and 
2-naphthylamine and 2- and 4-aminobiphenyl in the urine of 48 German smokers and 
non-smokers. The results indicate that both gr oups excrete these four aromatic amines, 
with smokers excreting approximatel y twice as much (736 ng/24 hours vs 303 ng/24 
hours). Similar amounts of urinary 2-naphthylamine and 4-aminobiphenyl were found in 
the two groups. The excreted aromatic amines decompose in the urine within a few hours, which explains why aromatic am ines are difficult to detect in this matrix (in this study 
para-toluidine was added to the urine as a stabi lizer). The origin of the aromatic amines 
found in the urine of non-smokers is unknown at present. Based on the cotinine levels in 
the urine of non-smokers, environmental to bacco smoke can be excluded as a major 
source of aromatic amines. In addition, neither diesel exhaust-related nitroarenes, nor the 
corresponding amino-derivatives to which they may be metabolically converted, were detected. The aromatic amines in urine arisin g from sources other than tobacco smoke or 
diesel exhaust may play a role in the et iology of bladder cancer in non-smokers. 
4.1.2  Animals 
Boyland (1958) and Boyland & Manson (1966) identified 24 metabolites of 
2-naphthylamine in the urine of rats, rabbits , dogs or monkeys. Metabolism occurs along 
four main pathways: (i) N-hydroxylation followed by conversion to 2-amino-1-naphthyl-
mercapturic acid, 2-nitrosonaphthalene and rearrangement to 2-amino-1-naphthol; (ii) 
oxidation at positions C5 and C6 to an arene oxide, which rearranges to 5-hydroxy-2-naphthylamine, reacts with water to form a 5,6-dihydrox ydihydro derivative and forms a 
5-hydroxy-6-mercapturic acid; (iii) conjugation of the amino group with acetic, sulphuric 
or glucuronic acid; (iv) secondary conjugation of the hydroxyl group with phosphate sulphuric or glucuronic acid. The proportion of  these metabolites excret ed in the urine of 
various experimental animals is different (Bonser et al. , 1951; Boyland & Manson, 1966; 
Conzelman et al. , 1969), although in most species 2-amino-1-naphthyl sulfate is the 
predominant metabolite. In early studies it was proposed that the ortho -hydroxylation 
metabolite 2-amino-1-naphthyl glucuronide was hydrolysed by β-glucuronidase present 
in urine, yielding 2-amino-1-naphthol (Allen et al. , 1957), which may act as the 
proximate carcinogen. The latter compound may be oxidized to form 2-amino-1-
naphthoquinone, which can form DNA adduc ts (Beland & Kadlubar, 1985; Yamazoe 
et al. , 1985). 
In dogs a small percentage of 2-naphthylamine was metabolized to bis-(2-amino-1-
naphthyl) hydrogen phosphate (Boyland et al. , 1961; Troll et al. , 1963). N-Oxidation of 2-
naphthylamine leads to more reactive me tabolites (Deichmann & Radomski, 1969). 
Radomski & Brill (1971) showed that after a single oral dose of 70 mg/kg bw of both the 
carcinogenic 2-isomer and the weakly active or  inactive 1-isomer of naphthylamine, the 
proportion of the dose converted into the corresponding N-hydroxylamine and nitroso  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 389  
 compound and excreted in th e urine was about the same. When a dose of 5 mg/kg bw was 
given, the proportion of the 2-isomer convert ed to these metabolites in the urine remained 
about the same (0.2%), whereas the 1-isomer gave  rise to barely detectable traces of these 
compounds. The unstable N-hydroxy metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronic 
acid conjugates and hydrolysed by acid or β-glucuronidase. These co njugates have been 
considered as the carcinogenic urinary me tabolites of aromatic amines in the dog 
(Radomski et al.,  1973). Methaemoglobinaemia, which is a measure of N-hydroxy 
compounds in the blood, was higher in the dog with the 2- isomer at the 70-mg/kg bw 
dose (Radomski & Brill, 1971). 
4.1.3  In-vitro systems 
Dermal penetration of 2-naphthylamine and ortho -toluidine through human skin was 
studied by use of diffusion cells. Both compounds penetrate rapidly (lag time 
approximately 1.2 and 0.8 hours, respectively) and in high percentages (54 and 50%, respectively, of the applied do se within 24 hours) (Lüersen et al. , 2006). 
Duverger-van Bogaert et al.  (1991) evaluated the ability of the cytosol from human 
red blood cells to activate aromatic amines using the Ames test with S. typhimurium strain 
TA98 under liquid preincubation conditions. While negative results were obtained with 
1-naphthylamine, a slight response was observed for 2-naphthylamine. 
The cytosol from nine fresh autopsy specimens of human bladder tissue was analysed 
for the presence of N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity towards para-aminobenzoic acid, 
4-aminobiphenyl, 2-aminofluorene, and 2-naphthylamine. Apparent Km values indicated 
little difference in NAT affinity (100–300 mi croM) for any of the substrates between the 
nine individual bladders. However, the apparent V
max values showed that the bladders 
could be divided in rapid or  slow acetylator phenotypes,  based on their NAT activity 
towards 4-aminobiphenyl, 2-aminofluorene, and 2-naphthylamine. Four of the bladder cytosols had mean activities significantly higher (approximately 10-fold, P < 0.01) than 
the mean NAT activities of the other five  bladder cytosols towards each arylamine 
carcinogen. However, no significant differen ce was detected in their NAT activities when 
para-aminobenzoic acid ws used as a substrate.  The human bladder cytosols were also 
tested for their capacity to activate N-hydroxy-3,2'-di methyl-4-aminobiphenyl to a DNA-
binding electrophile through direct O-acetyltransferase (OAT)-mediated catalysis. The N-
hydroxyarylamine OAT activity also discriminated between two levels of activation, 
being significantly higher (about twofold, P = 0.0002) in the rapidly N-acetylating bladder 
cytosols, which correlated (r = 0.94) with th e measured levels of NAT activity in each 
cytosol. These results suggest  that NAT activity and OAT activity of the human bladder 
vary concordantly with N-acetylator phenotype. The po lymorphic expression of these 
acetylation activities may be important risk factors in human susceptibility to bladder 
cancer from arylamine carcinogens (Kirlin et al. , 1989). 
The metabolic activation of 4-aminobip henyl, 2-naphthylamine, and several 
heterocyclic amines has been shown to be  catalysed by rat cytochrome P450ISF-G 390 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 [CYP1a2] and by its human ortholog, cytochrome P450PA [CYP1A2] (Butler et al., 
1989a). In humans, hepatic microsomal caffein e 3-demethylation is the initial major step 
in caffeine biotransformation, which is sel ectively catalysed by cytochrome P450PA. 
Caffeine 3-demethylation was highly correlated with 4-aminobiphenyl N-oxidation 
(r = 0.99; P <0.0005) in hepatic microsomal preparations obtained from 22 human organ donors, and both activities were similarl y decreased by the selective inhibitor 
7,8-benzoflavone. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human cytochrome 
P450PA strongly inhibited these activities as well as the N-oxidation of the carcinogen 2-
naphthylamine and other amines. Human li ver cytochrome P450PA also catalysed 
caffeine 3-demethylation, 4-aminobiphenyl N-oxidation, and phenacetin O-deethylation. 
Thus, estimation of caffeine 3- demethylation activity in humans may be useful in the 
characterization of arylamine N-oxidation phenotypes and to  assess whether or not the 
hepatic levels of cytochrome P450PA, as affected by environmental or genetic factors, 
contribute to inter-individual differences in  susceptibility to aryl amine-induced cancers 
(Butler et al. , 1989b). 
Moore et al.  (1984) investigated the metabolism of benzidine and 2-naphthylamine in 
organ cultures of human and rat bladder. There was little oxidative metabolism of either carcinogen in either sp ecies. In particular, N-hydroxy-2-naphthylamine, a proximate 
carcinogen of 2-naphthylamine could not be de tected. In contrast, large amounts of the 
acetylated metabolites, viz. N-acetylbenzidine, N,N-diacetylbenzidine and N-acetyl-2-
naphthylamine were formed both in rat and human bladder cultures. 
Microsomal enzyme preparations from dog liver, kidney, and bladder were used to 
assess the prostaglandin H synthase-catalysed activation of carcinogenic aromatic amines 
to bind covalently to proteins and nucl eic acids. Bladder transitional epithelial 
microsomes activated ortho -dianisidine, 4-aminobiphenyl, and 2-naphthylamine to bind 
to protein and tRNA, and benzidine and ortho -dianisidine to bind to DNA. Co-substrate 
and inhibitor specificities were consistent wi th activation by prostaglandin H synthase. 
Binding of benzidine to protein was not observed with either hepatic or renal cortical 
microsomes upon addition of arachidonic acid or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Pros taglandin H synthase and mixed-function oxidase-catalysed 
binding of 2-naphthylamine to protein and to tRNA were compared by use of liver and 
bladder microsomes. Only mixed-function oxidase-catalysed binding was observed in 
liver, and only prostaglandin H synthase-catalysed binding w as seen in bladder. The rate 
of binding catalysed by bladder microsomes w as considerably greater than that catalysed 
by hepatic microsomes. In addition, the bladder content of prostaglandin H synthase activity was approximately 10 times that in the inner medulla of the kidney, a tissue 
reported to have a relatively high content of this enzyme in other species. These results 
are consistent with involvement of bladder transitional epithelial prostaglandin H synthase in the development of primary aromatic amine-induced bladder cancer (Wise et al. , 1984) 
Hammons et al.  (1985) studied the in-vitro hepatic metabolism of 2-aminofluorene 
(2-AF), 2-naphthylamine a nd 1-naphthylamine by use of high-pressure liquid 
chromatography. Hepatic microsomes from rats, dogs, and humans were shown to  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 391  
 catalyse the N-oxidation of 2-AF and of 2-naphthylamine, but not of 1-naphthylamine; 
and the rates of N-oxidation of 2-AF were 2- to 3-fold greater than the N-oxidation rate of 
2-naphthylamine. In each species, rates of  1-hydroxylation of 2-naphthylamine and 
2-hydroxylation of 1-naphthylamine were comparable and were 2- to 5-fold greater than 
6-hydroxylation of 2-naphthylamine or 5- and 7-hydroxylation of 2-AF. Purified rat hepatic monooxygenases, cyto chromes P450UT-A, P450UT- H, P450PB-B, P450PB-D, 
P450BNF-B, and P450ISF/BNF-G but not P450PB-C or P450PB/PCN-E, catalysed 
several ring oxidations as well as the N-oxidation of 2-AF. Cytochromes P450PB-B, 
P450BNF-B, and P450ISF/BNF-G were most active; however, only cytochrome 
P450ISF/BNF-G, the isosafrole-i nduced isozyme, catalysed the N-oxidation of 2-
naphthylamine. The purified porcine hepatic  flavin-containing monooxygenase is known 
to carry out the N-oxidation of 2-AF, but only ring-oxidation of 1-naphthylamine and 2-
naphthylamine was detected. No N-oxidation of 1-naphthylamine was found with any of 
the purified enzymes, which is in line with  the fact that no carcinogenicity is observed 
with this compound. Furthermore, carcinogenic arylamines appear to be metabolized 
similarly in humans and experimental anim als. Enzyme mechanis ms accounting for the 
observed product distributions were evaluated by Hückel molecular-orbital calculations on neutral, free-radical, and cation intermed iates. The authors proposed a reaction 
pathway that involves two consec utive one-electron oxidations to form a paired substrate 
cation-enzyme hydroxyl-a nion intermediate that collapses to ring- and N-hydroxy 
products (Hammons et al. , 1985; see also Sasaki et al., 2002). 
Boyd and Eling (1987) examined the oxidation of the bladder carcinogen 
2-naphthylamine by prostaglandin H synthase (PHS)  in vitro . Oxygen-uptake studies of 
2-naphthylamine oxidation in the presence of  glutathione, as well as extensive product 
analysis yielded data that were consistent with a one-electron mechanism of 2-naphthyl-
amine oxidation by PHS. The formation of 2-nitroso-naphthalene was not observed under any condition. Metabolism studies with a pu rified PHS preparation confirmed that 
2-naphthylamine oxidation is dependent on the peroxidase activity of the enzyme 
complex, and that a variety of organic hydroperoxides may su pport the reaction. 
Horseradish peroxidase oxidized 2-naphthylamin e to the same products but, depending on 
the pH, in very different proportions from those obtained with PHS. Oxidation of 
2-naphthylamine by a one-elect ron chemical oxidant resulted in a product profile similar 
to that obtained in the enzymatic systems. These results are consistent with a one-electron 
mechanism of 2-naphthylamine oxidation by PHS. The metabolism data also provide 
evidence for the formation of two types of  potentially reactive electrophile: 2-imino-1-
naphthoquinone and a free-radical species. 
Poupko et al.  (1983) studied microsome-mediated N-hydroxylation of 4-amino-
biphenyl in mucosal tissue of bovine and canine bladder rela tive to the activity in liver. 
Bovine bladder microsomes mediated the N-hydroxylation of this amine at an 
exceptionally high rate, wher eas no detectable activity w as found with bovine liver 
microsomes. Dog-bladder microsomes were 40 –100 times less active than bovine bladder 
microsomes and contained approximately one third the amount of cytochrome P450 392 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 (CYP). Dog liver microsomes were as active as dog bladder microsomes per nanomole 
CYP, and an order of magnitude more active when normalized to microsomal protein. Rat liver microsomes contained the highest level of CYP of all the preparations studied, and 
N-hydroxylase activity was approximately twi ce that in dog liver. Metabolic conversion 
of 4-ABP, 2-naphthylamine, and 1-naphthylami ne into mutagens with S9 from bovine 
bladder mucosa was investigated in Salmonella typhimurium  and found to parallel the 
carcinogenic potency of these compounds. Th ese results demonstrate considerable tissue-, 
species-, and compound-specific ity for the metabolic activation of aromatic amines, and 
provide further eviden ce in support of activ ation of the amines in the bladder as a 
mechanism of aromatic amine-in duced bladder cancer (Poupko et al. , 1983). 
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
4.2.1  Experimental systems 
(a) DNA adducts of 2-naphthylamine 
Three DNA adducts are form ed by the reaction of N-hydroxy-2-naphthylamine with 
DNA in vitro  at pH 5.0 (Beland et al. , 1983; Beland & Kadlubar, 1985). The major 
adduct has been characterized as an imidazole ring-opened derivative of 
N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-naphthylamine (50% of the total adducts); there were smaller 
amounts of 1-(deoxyguanosin- N
2-yl)-2-naphthylamine (30% of total adducts) and 
1-(deoxyadenosin- N6-yl)-2-naphthylamine (15% of to tal adducts). These same three DNA 
adducts were formed in target (urothelium) and non-target (liver) tissues of dogs two days 
after the oral administration of 2-naphthylam ine (Beland & Kadlubar, 1985). A four-fold 
higher binding level of 2-naphthylamine was found in urothelial DNA compared with that 
in the liver. The major ad duct in both tissues was th e ring-opened derivative of 
N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-naphthylamine; th ere were smaller amounts of 1-(deoxy-
adenosin- N2-yl)-2-naphthylamine and 1-(deoxyguanosin- N2-yl)-2-naphthylamine. The 
N2-deoxyguanosine adduct persisted in the dog liver, and both this adduct and the ring-
opened C8-deoxyguanosine adduct persisted in the bladder. The differential loss of 
adducts indicates that active repair processes are ongoing in both tissues, and the relative 
persistence of the ring-opened C8-deoxyguanos ine adduct in the ta rget but not the non-
target tissue suggests that this adduct is a critic al lesion for the initiation of urinary bladder 
tumours. 
Peroxidative enzymes, such as prostaglan din H synthase (PHS), catalyse both the 
N-oxidation and ring-oxidation of 2-naphthylamine, a major ring-oxidation product being 
2-amino-1-naphthol (Yamazoe et al. , 1985). When PHS was used  to catalyse the binding 
of 2-naphthylamine to DNA, the sa me three adducts arising from N-hydroxy-2-
naphthylamine were detected. In addition ther e were three other adducts, which appeared 
to be formed from 2-imino-1-naphthoquinone, the oxidative product of 2-amino-1-
naphthol. The major product was characterized as N4-(deoxyguanosin- N2-yl)-2-amino-
1,4-naphthoquinone-imine; two minor products were tentatively identified as  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 393  
 N4-(deoxyadenosin- N6-yl)-2-amino-1,4-naphthoquinone-imine and a deoxyguanosin- N2-
yl adduct of a naphthoquinone-imine dimer (Beland & Kadlubar, 1985; Yamazoe et al. , 
1985). These DNA adducts, fo rmed via peroxidation, accoun ted for approximately 60% 
of the total DNA binding that was observed by incubation of 2-naphthylamine with PHS 
in vitro . In vivo , in dogs, the DNA adducts derived from 2-imino-1-naphthoquinone 
accounted for approximately 20 % of the 2-naphthylamine bou nd to urothelial DNA, but 
they were not detected in liver DNA (Yamazoe et al. , 1985). The remaining adduction 
products were derived from N-hydroxy-2-naphthylamine. Thus, PHS expressed in the 
bladder could play a significant role in bioac tivation of arylamines di rectly in the bladder 
and could contribute to carcinogenesis of 2-naphthylamine and other arylamines that 
serve as substrates of PHS. 
(b) Genotoxicity of 2-naphthylamine 
Most of the genetic effects of 2-naphthylam ine have been reviewed (Mayer 1982) and 
are summarized in Supplement 7 of the IARC Monographs (IARC, 1987). 2-Naphthyl-amine exhibits weak mutagenicity in the microbial assays and in some 
mammalian systems in vitro . Results for the mutagenicity of 2-naphthylamine in yeast 
assays have been inconsistent. In the assays in vivo , 2-naphthylamine was positive in the 
sex-linked recessive lethal assay with Drosophila melanogaster , but it failed to induce 
sister chromatid exchange in the mouse.  Several micronucleus tests and sperm-
abnormality assays with mice yielded in conclusive results. In the bone-marrow 
micronucleus assay, very high doses of 2-naphthylamine (200–800 mg/kg bw) were 
required to elicit effects in C57BL6 male mice (Mirkova & Ashby, 1988). 
2-Naphthylamine was positive in the mammalian spot test in T stock mice given nine doses of 2-naphthylamine (50 to 100 mg/kg bw), but there was no clear dose-response 
effect (Chauhan et al. , 1983). Few other data exist about the mutagenic effects of 2-
naphthylamine in whole organisms, although it is known to induce DNA fragmentation in rodent liver after treatment in vivo  (Parodi et al. , 1981). 
(i) Bacterial mutagenesis  
The metabolic conversion of 2-naphthylamin e (5–50 µg/plate) to a bacterial mutagen 
in S. typhimurium  TA100 was catalysed much more efficiently by the hamster than by 
any of the other species tested (human, pig, ra t, mouse). Mouse preparations displayed the 
weakest activity (Phillipson & Ioannides, 1983). In two ot her studies, the activities of 
liver-S9 preparations from rats pre-treated with PCBs or 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) 
were comparable to the activities of liver-S9  obtained from guinea-pigs pre-treated with 
the same CYP450 inducers in bio-activation of  2-naphthylamine (2.5–10 µg/plate) to a 
bacterial mutagen in strain TA100 (Baker et al. , 1980). Liver-S9 preparations from rats 
pre-treated with PCB or 3-MC also displayed comparable activity in bio-activation of 2-
naphthylamine (10–50 µg/plate) in strain TA1535 (Bock-Hennig et al. , 1982). Bovine 
urinary bladder cells, but not hepatocytes, were able to activate 2-naphthylamine to 
bacterial mutagens in S. typhimurium  TA98; the minimal amount of 2-naphthylamine 394 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 required to increase the level of revertants  over background was 20 µg/plate (Hix et al. , 
1983). Bovine bladder cells were also ab le to bioactivate 2-naphthylamine (20–80 
µg/plate) to a mutagen in S. typhimurium  strain TA100, with the activity being about six- 
to eight-fold higher than in TA98; however, bladder cells did not activate 2-naphthyl-
amine (20 µg/ml) to a mutagen in hamster V79 cells when resistence to 6-thioguanine 
was used as a genetic marker (Oglesby et al. , 1983). The finding of bacterial mutagenicity 
of 2-naphthylamine (4–5000 µg/ml) was corroborated by bioactivation with rat-liver S9 
(PCB-pretreatment) in the Ames II assay (Flückiger-Isler et al. , 2004). 
Recombinant human CYPs 1A1, 1A2 and 1B1 were unable to activate 2-naphthyl-
amine (5 µM) to a DNA-damaging agent, when the induction of umu was used as an 
endpoint, in S. typhimurium  strain NM2009, which expresses multiple copies of bacterial 
O-acetyltransferase (Shimada et al. , 1996). 2-Naphthylamine (up to 100 µM) also failed 
to induce the umu response in S. typhimurium  tester strains expressing human CYP1A1, 
1A2, 1B1, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4 with bacterial O-acetyltransferase (Oda et al. , 2001). 
However, 2-naphthylamine ( ≥ 1 µM) in the presence of recombinant human CYP1A2 did 
induce the umu response in S. typhimurium  tester strains NM6001 and NM6002, which 
expressed recombinant human acetyltransferase NAT1 and NAT2 isoforms, respectively, 
but not in strain NM6000, which is O-acetyltransferase-deficient (Oda 2004). The level of 
umu induction by 2-naphthylamine was about twofold higher in strain NM6001 than in 
NM6002 (Oda 2004). Purified rat CYP4B1 was the most efficient haemoprotein among 
10 different CYP450s in bioactivating 2-naphthylamine (10 µM) and inducing the umu 
response in S. typhimurium  NM2009 (Imaoka et al. , 1997). 
In the E. coli  K-12 uvrB/recA  DNA-repair host-mediated assay in male NMRI mice, 
2-naphthylamine (i.p. 200 mg/kg bw) elicited differential killing in E. coli  retrieved from 
the kidney and testicles, but no  activity was observed in blood, liver or lung. Surprisingly, 
1-naphthylamine (i.p. 33 and 100 mg/kg bw) showed a quite different pattern, inducing differential killing of E. coli  retrieved from blood, liver, lung and kidneys (Hellmér & 
Bolcsfoldi, 1992). 
The results of studies on bacterial mutage nesis of 2-naphthylam ine with recombinant 
CYP450 enzymes are inconsistent. This may be  due to varying assay conditions and the 
presence of different phase-II enzymes that mo dulate the metabolism of 2-naphthylamine. 
(ii) Mammalian mutagenesis  
2-Naphthylamine (50 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL)  in the presence of liver microsomes 
from PCB-pretreated rats was shown to incr ease the level of mutations by up to tenfold 
over background levels at five  independent genetic loci in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 
cells (Gupta & Singh, 1982). Mutation induction was also observed at these loci in the 
absence of a metabolic activation system, in dicating that the CHO cells are capable of 
bioactivating 2-naphthylamine (Gupta & Singh, 1982). However, 2-naphthylamine (20 µg/ml) was not mutagenic in hamster V79 cells, based on selection of 6-thioguanine-
resistant mutants in the presence of bovine  urinary bladder cells for bioactivation 
(Oglesby et al. , 1983).  2-NAPHTHYLAMINE 395  
 (iii) DNA damage induced by human carcinogens in cell-free assays  
2-Naphthylamine (0.2–1 mM) induced DNA damage—measured by 32P-
postlabelling—when calf-thymus DNA was co-inc ubated with 2-naphthylamine and liver 
microsomes from rats pretreated with phenobarbital or β-naphthoflavone as CYP 
inducers. However, the bio activated 2-naphthylamine did not induce DNA fragmentation 
(Adams et al. , 1996). 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
2-Naphthylamine was formerly used as a dye intermediate and in the rubber industry; 
it is no longer used commercially and its ma nufacture has been bann ed in the European 
Union since 1998. 2-Naphthylamine can be fo rmed by pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing 
organic matter. Recent analytical methods perm it detection at the parts-per-billion level. 
Occupational exposure occurred during production, during its use in the 
manufacturing of dyes, and when present as a co ntaminant in antioxidants used in rubber 
production. In workers exposed primarily to aniline and 4-chloroaniline, urinary levels of 2-naphthylamine of both smokers and non-smokers were higher than in non-smoking 
non-exposed workers. The rubber antioxidant N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine can be 
contaminated with 2-naphthylamine and may also be metabolised to 2-naphthylamine. 
The major sources of exposure for the genera l population are environmental exposure 
to 2-naphthylamine and 2-nitr onaphthalene, tobacco smoke and fumes from cooking oil. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
Numerous case series and 11 cohort studi es (four in the USA, two in the United 
Kingdom, two in Japan, and one each in Ital y, Poland and the Russian Federation) are 
available concerning bladder-cancer risks in  workers engaged in the manufacture and use 
of 2-naphthylamine. All of these case series and cohort studies indicate that markedly 
elevated bladder-cancer risks are associat ed with the manufacture and use of 
2-naphthylamine. In some of these studies, it wa s not possible to quantify the relative 
contributions of benz idine and 2-naphthylamine exposur es in the overall excess risks. 
However, a United Kingdom study on bladder- cancer risks in the British rubber industry 
showed that the elimination of the antiox idants contaminated with 2-naphthylamine 
(without other changes in in dustrial practices) was enough to  eliminate the excess risk for 
bladder cancer in the industry. 396 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
2-Naphthylamine was tested for carcinogenic ity by oral administration in mice, rats, 
hamsters, rabbits, dogs and monkeys. Following oral administration, it induced bladder 
neoplasms in monkeys, dogs and hamsters, and liver tumours in mice. A low incidence of 
bladder carcinomas was observed in rats afte r oral administration. In lung-adenoma 
bioassays in mice by oral and intraperitoneal  injection, 2-napht hylamine produced an 
increase multiplicity in lung tumours. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
2-Naphthylamine undergoes bioactivation by human and animal CYP450s to produce 
N-hydroxy-2-naphthylamine, which reacts with  DNA to form several adducts. A second 
bioactivation pathway occurs with peroxi dases to form 2-amino-1-naphthol. This 
metabolite can undergo oxidation to produ ce 2-imino-1-naphthoquinone, which reacts 
with DNA to form a unique adduct in the urothelium of experimental animals. Liver and 
bladder tissues from various species activ ate 2-naphthylamine to a genotoxicant in vitro  in 
bacteria and mammalian cells. Both CYPs and peroxidases may play a significant role in 
inducing genetic damage of 2-naphthylamine in the urothelium.

1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
The synthesis of toluidines begins with  a mixed-acid (nitri c/sulfuric acid) 
mononitration of toluene, which produces all three isomers ( ortho , meta, para), usually in 
the ratio 15:1:9, respectively. Since the isomeric toluidines themselves cannot be 
effectively separated by distillation, sepa ration of the isomers is achieved at the 
nitrotoluene stage. The literature descri bes a multitude of methods for reducing 
nitrotoluenes to toluidines. These range from dissolving metal reductions to catalytic  ortho- TOLUIDINE 409  
 hydrogenation. Currently, hi gh-volume manufacture of toluidines utilizes the same type 
of continuous vapour-phase hydrogenation process used for aniline manufacture. The 
hydrogenation catalysts include various supported metals, Raney nickel, copper, 
molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, and noble metals (Bowers, 2000). 
Commercial production was first re ported in the USA in 1922 for ortho -toluidine and 
in 1956 for ortho -toluidine hydrochloride (IARC, 1982, 2000). In the late 1970s, 
production volumes were estimated to be 1.1 to 11 million pounds/year, but this increased 
to 14.5 to 28.2 million pounds/yea r by the early 1990s (IARC, 2000). ortho -Toluidine 
hydrochloride has not been commercially produced in the USA since 1975 (HSDB, 
2009). 
Information was collected in 1994 in Europe  for the IUCLID database for substances 
with a production or import volume greater than 1000 tonnes/year (High Production 
Volume Chemicals (HPVCs)). ortho -Toluidine was included on the list of HPVCs with a 
range of 100 000 to 500 000 tonnes (Allanou et al. , 1999; European Commission, 2000). 
The USEPA (2003, 2007) Inventory Update Rule regulation requires manufacturers 
and importers of certain chemical substances listed in the TSCA Chemical Substance 
Inventory to report manufacturing inform ation (aggregate production volumes) for 
chemicals manufactured (including imported) in amounts of 10 000 pounds or greater (in 
1986) or 25 000 pounds or greater (in 2003) at a single site. Table 1.2 presents the 
aggregate production volumes that were reported for ortho -toluidine. 
Available information indicates that ortho -toluidine was produced and/or supplied in 
the following countries: Canada, France, Germ any, Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Neth erlands, the People’s Republic of China, 
South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the USA (Chemical Sources 
International, 2010).

 1.2.2  Use 
ortho -Toluidine, the isomer produced in greatest volume, has found many 
commercial applications. By fa r the single largest use for ortho -toluidine is in the 
preparation of 6-ethyl- ortho -toluidine, an intermediate in the manufacture of two very 
large-volume herbicides, metolachlor a nd acetochlor. Another important use for 
ortho -toluidine is in rubber chemicals, where it is used in the manufacture of a rubber 
antioxidant, and of di- ortho -tolylguanidine, a nonstaining rubber accelerator. Acetoacet-
ortho -toluidine, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoyl- ortho -toluidine, 2-toluidine-5-sulfonic acid, and 
ortho -aminoazotoluene are four of the more important dye and pigment intermediates 
manufactured from ortho -toluidine. In addition, ortho -toluidine is used to manufacture 
epoxy resin hardeners such as methylene-bi s-2-methylcyclohexylamine, fungicide inter-
mediates such as 2-amino-4-methylbenzothiazole, and ortho -fluorobenzoyl chloride. 
Certain pharmaceutical intermediates are also prepared starting with ortho -toluidine 
(Bowers, 2000). 
Other minor uses of ortho -toluidine and its hydrochlorid e salt are as intermediates in 
organic synthesis and as ingredients in a clini cal laboratory reagent for glucose analysis 
(HSDB, 2009). 
1.3 Occurrence and exposure 
1.3.1  Natural occurrence 
ortho -Toluidine is not known to exist as a natural substance. 
1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
Occupational exposure to ortho -toluidine can occur during its production, or during 
the production of dyes, pigments and ru bber chemicals manufactured from this 
compound. Laboratory and medical personnel may be exposed when using 
ortho -toluidine for staining tissues. 
(a) Production of ortho-toluidine 
In the former USSR (Khlebnikova et al. , 1970), air samples at a plant manufacturing 
ortho -toluidine from ortho -nitrotoluene (215 samples) ge nerally exceeded the maximum 
permissible concentrations of 3 mg/m3 (IARC 1982) by 2–7 times. The highest airborne 
exposure concentrations were observed du ring distillation and ex traction processes (25–
28.6 mg/m3). Concurrently, in 80–90% of the air samples ortho -nitrotoluene levels 
exceeded the maximum permissible concentration of 1 mg/m3: values up to 
approximately 5 mg/m3 were reported. Dermal deposition of ortho -toluidine at 0.01–
0.03 mg/dm2 of skin was measured by collecting 1%  acetic acid washes from the wrists, 
chest and back of individuals at the end of work-shifts ( n = 168). After post-shift showers,  ortho- TOLUIDINE 411  
 dermal levels of ortho -toluidine had decreased by a factor  of 10. Patches of cloth placed 
on the workers’ overalls collected about 0.10 mg/dm2 (n = 46). 
(b) Use of ortho -toluidine in dye production 
Measurements in the 1940s in  a dye-production plant in the United States indicated 
that the concentration of ortho -toluidine was below 0.5 ppm (2.19 mg/m3) in the 
workroom air (breathing zone and area samples) and ranged from < 0.3 ppm to 1.7 ppm  
in the urine of workers engaged in the production of thioindigo. In addition to inhalatory 
exposure, exposure from ingest ion and skin contact may have occurred (Ott & Langner, 
1983). 
Exposure to ortho -toluidine was reported to occur in an Italian plant producing 
fuchsin (magenta) and safranine T-based dyes (Rubino et al. , 1982), in a German plant 
producing 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine (Stasik, 1988), and in a plant producing azo-dyes in 
New Jersey, USA (Delzell et al. , 1989). No data on exposure levels were provided. 
(c) Production and use of rubber antioxidant 
ortho -Toluidine, aniline, hydroquinone and toluene were used to synthesize a rubber 
antioxidant in a chemical pl ant in the United States. Despite low air concentrations 
(< 1 ppm; 4.38 mg/m3), elevated pre-shift urinary ortho -toluidine levels of 18 ± 27 μg/L 
(n = 46) and post-shift levels of 104 ± 111 μg/L were detected. The average concentration 
of ortho -toluidine in the pre-shift samples was 17  times higher than that in urine samples 
of unexposed workers (Ward et al. , 1991; Teass et al. , 1993). 
Sorahan et al.  (2000) reported worker exposure to ortho -toluidine in a plant that 
produced rubber chemicals in the Unite d Kingdom, but no data on exposure 
concentrations were provided. 
Korinth et al.  (2006) reported on four workers involved in vulcanising hydraulic 
rubber articles, who were exposed to ortho -toluidine contained in di- ortho -tolylguanidine 
(used as an accelerator for the vulcanization of rubber products) by dermal absorption. 
The concentrations of ortho -toluidine in the air at the workplace ranged between 26.6–
93.9 μg/m3 and ortho -toluidine concentrations in urine were between 54.7–242.9 μg/L. 
(d) Demolition workers of an SO 2 plant polluted with ortho -toluidine 
Labat et al.  (2006) measured urinary ortho -toluidine levels in workers employed in 
the demolition of a liquid-SO 2 plant polluted with ortho -toluidine. The plant had stopped 
production 20 years earlier. For unexposed workers, urinary concentrations of ortho -
toluidine ranged between 0.17 and 2.46 μg/g creatinine. Post-shift urinary concentrations 
for exposed workers ranged between 26.1 and 462 μg/g creatinine. After protective 
measures were taken, this  decreased to 2.4–20.1 μg/g creatinine. 412 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 (e) Laboratory workers 
Although medical and laboratory personnel represent a significant population of 
workers potentially exposed to ortho -toluidine, air concentrations have been determined 
to be below 22 µg/l (Environmental Protection Agency, 1984). Kauppinen et al.  (2003) 
reported that in 1988 in Finland, five of 26 pathological laboratories used ortho -toluidine 
for staining tissues with a median use of 10 g/ year, three of 30 clini cal laboratories used it 
with a median use of 180 g/year, and six of 20 other laboratories with a median use of 
10 g/year. 
1.3.3  Environmental occurrence and exposure of the general population 
The general population is known to be exposed ubiquitously to ortho -toluidine, 
although its origin is not known. The levels found are not explained by known exposures. 
(a) Air 
According to the Toxics Release Inventory (Environmental Protection Agency, 
1997), air emissions of ortho -toluidine from 23 industrial facilities were approximately 
5260 kg in 1995 in the United States. 
(b) Water 
Surface-water discharges of ortho -toluidine from 23 industrial facilities in the United 
States, as reported in the Toxics Release Invent ory, decreased from 24 2 kg in 1994 to 116 
kg in 1995 (Environmental Protection Agency, 1996, 1997). 
ortho -Toluidine has been report ed to be present in surface-water samples taken from 
three rivers in Germany, at levels of 0.3–1 µg/L (Neurath et al. , 1977). ortho -Toluidine 
has been identified in one secondary effluent from seven industrial and publicly owned 
treatment works (Ellis et al. , 1982) and in wastewaters from synthetic fuel production 
(Leenheer et al. , 1982; Stuermer et al. , 1982). It has also been detected in effluents from 
refineries and chemical production facilities, in process water, river water, groundwater 
and seawater in the United St ates (Shackelford & Keith, 19 76; Environmental Protection 
Agency, 1984; NTP, 2005). 
(c) Soil 
Soil discharges of ortho -toluidine from 23 industrial facilities in 1995 in the United 
States amounted to 5.5 kg, as reported in  the Toxics Release Inventory (Environmental 
Protection Agency, 1997). An estimated 10 000 kg of ortho -toluidine were released via 
underground injection.  ortho- TOLUIDINE 413  
 (d) Food and beverages 
Neurath et al.  (1977) found unspecified isomer s of toluidine in commercially 
available samples of kale and celery (1.1 mg/kg) and carrots (7.2 mg/kg). ortho -Toluidine 
has been identified in the volatile aroma components of black tea (Vitzthum et al. , 1975). 
DeBruin et al.  (1999) measured ortho -toluidine at part per b illion levels in breast-milk 
samples from both smokers and nonsmokers (< 0.01 to 0.26 ppb). The concentrations observed did not correlate with smoking status, suggesting that tobacco smoking is not the 
main source of exposure. 
(e) Tobacco smoke 
Mainstream smoke from eight US commercial cigarette brands has been found to 
contain 8.6–144.3 ng ortho -toluidine per cigarette (Stabbert et al. , 2003). The 
concentrations of ortho -toluidine tend to be much higher in sidestream smoke than in 
mainstream smoke (IARC, 2004). 
Riedel et al.  (2006) reported urinary excretion of ortho -toluidine at 70.1–
139.6 ng/24 hours (mean ± SD, 105.2 ± 25.6) for nine nonsmokers and 107.9–258.7 
(mean ± SD, 204.2 ± 59.1) for 10 smokers. Higher amounts were reported in an earlier 
study (El-Bayoumy et al. , 1986), with a mean ortho -toluidine excretion of 4.1 µg/24 
hours in 12 nonsmokers and 6.3 µg/24 hours in 16 smokers. 
In a study by Riffelmann and colleagues (1995), urinary concentrations of ortho -
toluidine in eight smokers averaged 1.7 ± 1.6 μg/L, while it was not detected in eight non-
smokers. In another study, current smoking had no influence on background values and on the increase of ortho -toluidine adducts to haemoglobin (Gaber et al. , 2007). 
(f) Hair dyes 
In a study from Turkey (Akyüz & Ata, 2008), ortho -toluidine was found in 34 of the 
54 hair dyes tested, at quantities up to 1547 µg/g. 
(g) Prilocaine 
Prilocaine, a widely used an aesthetic, is metabolized to ortho -toluidine. A component 
of EMLA cream, it is also used as a pain reliever in neonates (Taddio et al. , 1998), during 
circumcision (Taddio et al. , 1997) and during venipuncture in children (Tak & van Bon, 
2006). 
1.4 Regulations and guidelines 
1.4.1  Europe 
(a) Directive 97/56/EC 
According to Directive 97/56/EC on the restrictions on the marketing and use of 
certain dangerous substances and preparations, the packaging of ortho -toluidine and its 414 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 preparations must be marked legibly and indelibly as follows: “Restricted to professional 
users” (European Co mmission, 1997). 
(b) Directive 2002/61/EC 
Directive 2002/61/EC restricts the marke ting and use of azocolourants (European 
Commission, 2002). In this Directive, A nnex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is amended. 
Azodyes that, by reductive cleavage of one or more azo groups, may release ortho -
toluidine in detectable concentrations, i.e. ab ove 30 ppm in the finished articles or in the 
dyed parts thereof, according to the test method established in accordance with Article 2a 
of this Directive, may not be used in textile and leather articles that may come into direct 
and prolonged contact with the human skin or oral cavity. 
(c) Directive 2004/37/EC 
ortho -Toluidine is regulated by the Directive 2004/37/EC (European Commission, 
2004), which applies to activities in wh ich workers are exposed to carcinogens or 
mutagens of Category 1 and 2. Rules are fixed regarding the employers' obligations of 
reduction and replacement, prevention and re duction of exposure, unforeseen exposure, 
foreseeable exposure, access to risk areas, hygien e and individual prot ection, information 
for the competent authority, information and training of  workers, consultation and 
participation of workers, health surveillance, record keeping and limit values. 
1.4.2  Germany 
Deviating from the EU classification, ortho -toluidine is classified as a Category 1 
carcinogen by the German MAK Commissi on (MAK, 2007). The MAK Commission 
listed ortho -toluidine as a substance for which percutaneous absorption may significantly 
contribute to systemic exposu re. A MAK value was not set. Furthermore, it was classified 
as a germ-cell mutagen, Class 3A: substances that have been shown to induce genetic 
damage in germ cells of humans or animals, or that produce mutagenic effects in somatic 
cells of mammals in vivo  and have been shown to reach the germ cells in an active form. 
1.4.3  Japan 
The Japan Society for Occupational Health  (2007) follows the classification by IARC 
of ortho -toluidine. An occupational exposure limit (OEL) of 1 ppm (4.4 mg/m3) was 
reported; skin absorption was noted. 
1.4.4  United Kingdom 
The Health and Safety Commission (HSE, 2007) has set an 8-hour time-weighted 
average Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL) of 0.2 ppm (0.89 mg/m3) for ortho -toluidine, 
with a skin notation. HSE also lists ortho -toluidine as capable of causing cancer.  ortho- TOLUIDINE 415  
 1.4.5  USA 
(a) ACGIH 
ortho -Toluidine has been assi gned an A3 notation, Confirmed Animal Carcinogen 
with Unknown Relevance to Humans  (ACGIH, 2001). A TLV-TWA (threshold limit 
value–time-weighted average) of 2 ppm (8.8 mg/m3) is recommended. Reported 
significant percutaneous absorption and its systemic health effects warrant assigning the 
skin notation ( potential significant cont ribution to the overall exp osure by the cutaneous 
route ). A methaemoglobin level in blood of 1. 5% of total haemoglo bin measured during 
or at the end of the shift is recommended as a Biological Exposure Index (BEI) for 
biological monitoring of exposure to ortho -toluidine. 
(b) NTP 
ortho -Toluidine and ortho -toluidine hydrochloride are listed in the NTP Report on 
Carcinogens  as reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens  (NTP, 2005).

 2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
2.1 Case reports 
Uebelin and Pletscher (1954) studied the occurrence of bladder tumours in workers 
employed at a factory in Swit zerland producing dyestuff interm ediates. A total of 97 cases 
were found in 300 workers exposed to various combinations of 2-naphthylamine, benzidine and other aromatic amines for unspecified periods during 1924–53. A further 
650 workers had been exposed only to anil ine or other aromatic amines, but not to 
2-naphthylamine or benzidine; three of th ese men developed bladder tumours, but their 
exact exposures were uncertain. The author s distinguished a subgroup of 35 men who 
prepared 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine from ortho -toluidine; no bladder tumours were found 
among these men. [The Working Group noted that  insufficient details were provided 
concerning person–years at risk or follow -up to evaluate the significance of these 
observations.] 
Gropp (1958) described 98 cases of bladde r tumours that occurred from 1903 to 1955 
among workers at a German factory. Oettel (1959, 1967) and Oettel et al.  (1968) also 
reported these cases and some additional on es. Most of Gropp’s cases had had exposure 
to 2-naphthylamine alone (23 men) or together with other amines, including benzidine, aniline and toluidines (45 men) . However, 11 cases were reported as having had exposure 
only to aniline/toluidine; the population at risk is not known. [The Working Group noted 
that insufficient details were provided concerning person–years at risk or follow-up to evaluate the significan ce of these observations.] 
Khlebnikova et al.  (1970) reported bladder tumours in workers engaged in the 
production of ortho -toluidine and/or para-toluidine in the USSR during the 1960s. The 
concentration range of ortho -toluidine measured in the ai r of the working environment 
was 0.5–28.6 mg/m
3. Two cases of bladder tumours (papillomas) were found when 75 of 
81 current toluidine-exposed workers were examined cysto scopically. The 81 workers 
comprised 35 operators, 18 fitters, and 10 clean ers. A total of 41 workers had worked in 
ortho -toluidine production for more  than five years; most of these workers had also been 
in contact with para-toluidine. Six other cases of bla dder tumours (including four 
carcinomas) had been found ear lier, upon cystoscopic examination of 16 former workers 
who had worked with the toluidines for periods ranging from 12 to 17 years. [The 
Working Group noted that the information contained in the paper with regard to person–years of exposure and to the other substan ces to which these workers may have had prior 
or concomitant exposure is insufficient to ev aluate the significance of these observations]. 
Lipkin (1972), in a further report from the USSR, referred to 27 cases of bladder 
cancer occurring in individual s exposed occupationally to ortho - and para-toluidine, and 
to 21 cases in workers exposed  to both these chemicals and to 1-naphthylamine. Genin 
et al.  (1978) referred to 36 people with bladder cancer who had been occupationally  
exposed to ortho - and para-toluidine and to “some other aromatic amino and nitro 
compounds” in a chemical plan t. The cancers were diagnosed in men and women aged  ortho- TOLUIDINE 417  
 between 25 and 61. [The Working Group noted that no information was given on the 
sizes of the populations at risk. It is possib le, but not explicitly stated, that these cases 
included some or all of t hose reported by Khlebnikova et al.  (1970).] 
Conso and Pontal (1982) reported thre e cases of bladder cancer occurring among 
50 workers employed in a factory where para-toluenediamine was synthesized from 
ortho -toluidine and ortho -aminoazotoluene. [The Working Group noted that although a 
formal estimate of expected numbers of bladder cancer cases was not provided, three 
bladder cancers among 50 persons is likely to represent a substantial excess. The relationship of these bladder cancers to ortho -toluidine exposure cannot be determined 
because of co-exposure to ortho -aminoazotoluene, which has been classified as possibly 
carcinogenic to humans (IARC, 1975, 1987).] 
2.2 Cohort studies (see Table 2.1)  
Case and Pearson (1954) and Case et al.  (1954) reported a historical cohort study of 
bladder tumours among workers in the British chemical industry engaged in the manufacture of dyestuff intermediates. Groups were defined in terms of exposure to 
aniline, benzidine, 1- and 2-naphthylamine, auramine and magenta. Many aniline-
exposed workers were also exposed to to luidines produced in the same plants. The 
21 firms in the survey includ ed the major British producers of aniline, and mortality was 
observed from 1921 to 1952. There were 812 men classified as having had exposure to 
aniline but not to the other suspected carcin ogens. The death certificate for one of these 
workers mentioned a bladder tumour; 0.52 such  deaths were expected on the basis of 
national rates [The Working Group noted that exposure of these workers to ortho -
toluidine is not specified in this paper bu t can be inferred from knowledge of aniline-
production processes]. 
Rubino et al.  (1982) reported mortality findings  for 906 men first employed in a 
dyestuff factory in northern Italy between 1922 and 1970 and followed from 1946 to 1976. Mortality was compared with that of the Italian male population. Follow-up was 
96% complete and 260 deaths were identifi ed. Thirty-six deaths from urinary bladder 
cancer were observed (SMR, 29.3; 95% CI, 20.5–40.5). Thirty-one of these deaths occurred among 610 men with exposure to one or more of benzidine, 1-naphthylamine, 
and 2-naphthylamine (SMR, 35.6; 95% CI, 24.2–50.6). Some of these workers were also 
exposed to ortho -toluidine, among other chemicals, and a significant excess of bladder 
cancer mortality was observed in the 53 me n engaged solely in the manufacture of 
magenta (IARC, 1993) and safranine T, also involving exposure to one or more of the 
following chemicals: toluene, ortho -nitrotoluene and 4,4 ′-methylene bis(2-methylaniline), 
2,5-diaminotoluene, ortho -aminoazotoluene and aniline (5  deaths; SMR, 62.5; 95% CI, 
20.3–145.9). No quantitative ex posure measurements or data on smoking were available. 
[The Working Group noted that the clear o ccupational excess of bladder cancer could not 
be specifically attributed with certainty to exposure to ortho -toluidine or to any one of the 
other compounds involved.] 418 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

  ortho- TOLUIDINE 421  
 Ott and Langner (1983) studied the mortality  of 342 male employees assigned to three 
aromatic amine-based dye-production areas from  1914 to 1958 at a chemical plant in the 
United States. All study subjects were currently working as of 1st January 1940 or hired 
after that date. Expected numbers of deat hs for the period 1940–1975 were based on 
mortality rates for US white males. There we re no deaths from bladder cancer, with 
1.5 deaths expected from malignant neoplasms of the urinary organs. In one area of the 
plant, 117 men produced bromindigo and thioindigo with potential exposure to 4-chloro-
ortho -toluidine and other raw materials and intermediates, including ortho -toluidine. No 
bladder cancer deaths occurred in this subcohort. [The expected figure was not reported.] 
There was one death from lymphoma [SMR, 0.83] and two deaths from leukaemia [SMR, 
2.22]. [The Working Group noted that the interpretation of this study was limited by the small size of the populati on exposed to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, and by  the ascertainment 
of deaths only.] 
Stasik (1988) reported findings from a mo rtality study of 335 male workers employed 
for at least twelve months in the period  1929–1982 in the produ ction and processing of 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine at a dyestuffs-manufact uring plant in Frankfurt, Hessen, 
Germany. Three other monocyclic amines had been used at the plant: N-acetyl- ortho -
toluidine, 6-chloro- ortho -toluidine and ortho -toluidine. Exposure to 4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine was reported to be predominant. No  deaths from bladder cancer were identified 
in the period 1929–1982 [expected figure unspecified but estimated on the basis of mortality rates for the Federal Republic of Germany to be about 0.2.] [The Working 
Group noted that the study had inadequate tracing of deaths and description of methods.] 
Two incident cases of urothelial carcinoma were subsequently identified  in this workforce 
in workers employed in the 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine production plant before 
improvements in industrial hygiene were made in  1970. As a result of this discovery, a 
cancer incidence study was establi shed for the 116 subjects empl oyed at this plant before 
1970. There was no cancer re gistry for the region in which the plant was located; 
expected numbers were therefore based on ra tes for Saarland, a neighbouring province of 
the Federal Republic of Germany. A marked excess of bladder cancer cases based on eight cases was reported (SIR, 72.7; 95% CI, 31 .4–143.3). No quanti tative measure of 
exposure to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was available, and exposure to other amines was 
also present. Median exposure time of the cases before 1970 was 14 years. Three of the 
eight cases were nonsmokers, one was a former smoker, two were smokers and the 
smoking habits of the remaining two were unknown. [The Working Group noted that the 
definition of the subcohort for th e cancer incidence survey was made a posteriori,  the 
obervational period was unspecified, and case ascertainment was inadequately described. 
Consequently, some bias in the estimate of excess risk may be present. The excess of 
bladder cancer could not be attributed with any certainty to ortho -toluidine or to any one 
of the other compounds present.] 
Ward et al.  (1991) reported findings for bladder cancer incidence in workers exposed 
to ortho -toluidine and aniline at a US chemi cal-manufacturing plant. The study was 
initiated at the request of union representatives who had noted several bladder cancers 422 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 among workers in the department that manufactured chemicals for the rubber industry. 
Among the major reactants used in these processes were two primary aromatic amines, ortho -toluidine and an iline; other reactants a nd intermediates included 
2-mercaptobenzothiazole, hydroquinone, toluen e, carbon disulfide, benzothiazole and a 
proprietary chemical, later id entified as nitrobenzene (Ward et al. , 1991; Ward et al. , 
1996; Viet et al. , 2009). The study cohort compri sed 1749 workers (1643 males, 
106 females) employed at the plant in the period 1946–1988. A total of 708 of these 
workers were considered to have been definitely exposed to ortho -toluidine and aniline; 
288 workers assigned to maintenance, janito rial, yard work and shipping departments 
were considered to have been possibly exposed, and the remaining 753 workers were 
considered to be probably unexposed. Vital status was identified for 1973 through 1988. Bladder-cancer cases were identified from co mpany or union records and confirmed 
through medical records, or through matching with records at the lo cal cancer registry. 
Expected numbers of incident bladder cancer s were based on local incidence rates. 
Overall, 13 cases of bladder cancer were observed for the period 1973–1988 (SIR, 3.6; 
95% CI, 1.9–6.2), seven of which occurred in the definitely exposed group (SIR, 6.5; 
95% CI, 2.6–13.3), four in the possibly exposed group (SIR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.0–9.4) and the remaining two cases in non-exposed worker s (SIR, 1.4; 95% CI 0.2–5.0). Bladder-
cancer incidence was particularly elevated in  employees who had worked in the exposed 
department for more than 10 years; six of  the seven exposed cas es occurred in this 
subcohort (SIR, 27.2; 95% CI, 10.0–59.2). Data on smoking were available for only 
143 study subjects but suggested that confou nding from smoking could explain no more 
than a small fraction of the observed bladder-cancer excess. Other chemical exposures at the plant should be considered . Aniline was present but is not known to induce bladder 
cancer in humans or animals (IARC, 1987 ). 4-Aminobiphenyl was identified as a 
potential low-level contaminant (< 1 ppm) in  some bulk samples of process chemicals at 
the plant in 1990 (Ward & Dankovic, 1991). 4-Aminobiphenyl is an IARC Group-1 
carcinogen and is known to be a highly potent human bladder carcinogen (IARC, 1972, 
1987). 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole has not been reviewed by IARC, but has shown some evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and equi vocal evidence of carcinogenicity in mice 
(NTP, 1988). An exposure-assessment study c onducted at the plant in 1990 (Ward et al. , 
1996) showed substantially higher urinary concentrations and levels of haemoglobin adducts of ortho -toluidine and aniline among exposed workers compared with in-plant 
controls. Levels of 4-aminobiphenyl adducts were much lower than those of ortho -
toluidine and aniline, and were similar for exposed and unexposed groups. [The Working Group noted that haemoglobin adducts reflect  only recent exposures (Hemminki, 1992), 
and it is therefore possible that higher levels  of 4-aminobiphenyl contamination existed in 
the past.] A subsequent mortality analysis of the same cohort for the period 1946–1994 (Prince et al. , 2000) found only two deaths from bladder cancer in the total cohort (SMR, 
2.1; 95% CI, 0.2–7.4). One of  these deaths occurred in the definitely exposed group 
(SMR, 3.8; 95% CI, 0.1–21.1). There were two deaths from lymphohaematopoietic cancers in the definitely expos ed group (SMR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.1–4.2). A further 19 cases  ortho- TOLUIDINE 423  
 of bladder cancer occurring in this cohort, 18 of which were diagnosed in the later period 
of 1989–2003, have been identified (Markowitz & Levin, 2004; Markowitz, 2005). Ten of these cases were stated to be members of  the definitely exposed subgroup. [The 
Working Group noted that the authors did no t have access to the study master files and 
were not able to provide expectations for thei r findings. Nevertheless , this article indicates 
a continuing excess of occu pational bladder cancer at the plant under study.] 
Sorahan et al.  (2000) updated a study of workers exposed to several aromatic amines 
in a factory manufacturing chemicals for th e rubber industry in the United Kingdom 
(Sorahan & Pope, 1993). All subjects had had at least six months’ employment in the 
factory and some employment in the period  1955–1984. Mortality wa s examined for the 
period 1955–1996 and cancer incidence for the period 1971–1992. The updated study included 2160 male production workers, 605 of whom had been exposed to one or more 
of the four chemicals under investigati on (aniline, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, phenyl- β-
naphthylamine, ortho -toluidine), including 53 workers who were exposed to ortho -
toluidine. In the latter subcohort, three bl adder cancer deaths were observed (SMR, 15.9; 
95% CI, 3.3–46.4). A total of 30 bladder cancers were identified in the overall cohort on 
the basis of death certificate or cancer re gistration data. Intern al analysis (Poisson 
regression) revealed a significant associatio n between the risk for bladder cancer and 
duration of exposure to ortho -toluidine (1–4 years, n = 2; RR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.6–28.4; 
≥ 5 years, n = 1; RR, 7.7; 95% CI, 1.0–56.9). 
[The Working Group noted that individual smoking habits were not available for all 
subjects in any of the published cohort stud ies. However, the excesses of bladder cancer 
reported in the four positive studies were much too large to have been due to smoking 
alone.] 
3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
Studies in experimental animals of carcinogenicity of ortho -toluidine and its 
hydrochloride salt were previously reviewed by IARC (1978, 1982, 1987, 2000). Those found to be adequate and/or reported more fully in later publications are included in this 
evaluation. 
3.1 Oral administration 
3.1.1  Mouse 
Groups of 25 male and 25 female Swiss CD -1 mice, 6–8 weeks of age, were treated 
with ortho -toluidine hydrochloride (purity, 97–99%) in the diet at levels of 16 000 or 
32 000 mg/kg diet (ppm) for three months and then, due to toxicity, at levels of 8000 or 
16 000 ppm for a further 15 months. Subsequently, the animals were kept without treatment for an additional three months a nd then killed. The doses were chosen on the 424 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 basis of preliminary tests, the higher being the maximum tolerated dose. A simultaneous 
control group of 25 untreated mice of each sex was used, plus additional controls used for 
the other compounds tested in the study, a nd tumour incidences of matched and pooled 
controls were compared statistically (both se parately and together) with those of treated 
groups. Animals that died during the first si x months of the study were discarded without 
necropsy. In male mice, the incidence of vascular tumours (haemangiomas and 
haemangiosarcomas combined, observed in a bdominal viscera) was 0/14, 5/99 (5%), 5/14 
(36%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) and 9/11 (82%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) in 
concurrent controls, pooled controls, low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively. In 
female mice, the incidence of vascular tumours (haemangiomas and haemangiosarcomas 
combined, observed in abdominal viscera)  was 0/15, 9/102 (9%), 5/18 (28%) ( P < 0.05, 
Fisher exact test) and 9/21 (43%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test ) in concurrent controls, 
pooled controls, low-dose and high-dose grou ps, respectively [the separate incidences for 
haemangiomas and haemangiosarcom as were not reported] (Weisburger et al. , 1978). 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F 1 mice, six weeks of age, were given ortho -
toluidine hydrochloride (purity > 99%) in the diet at 1000 or 3000 ppm for 102–
103 weeks. Concurrent control groups consis ted of 20 male and 20 female untreated 
mice. The mean body weights of both treated males and females were lower than those of 
the corresponding controls, and were dose-relate d. Mortality was not significantly related 
to treatment in either sex. In male mice, the incidence of haemangiomas or 
haemangiosarcomas (combined, all sites, ma inly observed in the abdominal viscera) was 
increased: 1/19 (5%), 2/50 (4%) and 12/50 (24%) ( P < 0.002, Cochran–Armitage trend 
test) in control, low-dose and high-dose gr oups, respectively. In female mice, the 
incidence of hepatocellular adenomas or carci nomas (combined) was also increased: 0/20, 
4/49 (8%) and 13/50 (26%) ( P < 0.007, Fisher exact test; P = 0.001 trend test) in control, 
low-dose and high-dose groups , respectively (National Ca ncer Institute, 1979). 
3.1.2  Rat 
Groups of 25 male Sprague-Dawley CD rats, 6–8 weeks of age, were treated with 
ortho -toluidine hydrochloride (purity 97–99%) in the diet at dose levels of 8000 or 
16 000 ppm for three months and then, due to toxicity, at levels of 4000 or 8000 ppm for 
a further 15 months. Animals were kept without treatment for an additional six months and then killed. The doses were chosen on the basis of preliminary tests, the higher being 
the maximum tolerated dose. A concurrent control group of 25 untreated male rats was 
used, plus additional controls used for the other compounds tested in the study, and tumour incidences of matched and pooled contro ls were compared with those of treated 
groups. Animals that died during the first six months of the study were discarded without 
necropsy. The incidence of subcutaneous fibromas and fibrosarcomas (combined) was 0/16, 18/111 (15%), 18/23 (78%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) and 21/24 (88%) 
(P < 0.025, Fisher exact test, co mpared with all controls) in simultaneous controls, pooled 
controls, low-dose and high-dose groups, resp ectively. A non-statistically significant  ortho- TOLUIDINE 425  
 increase in the incidence of transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder was also 
observed: 0/16, 5/111 (5%), 3/23 (13%) and 4/24 (17%) in simultaneous controls, pooled controls, low-dose and high-dose gr oups, respectively (Weisburger et al. , 1978). 
Groups of 30 male Fischer 344 rats, ei ght weeks of age, were treated with ortho -
toluidine hydrochloride [recrystallized product, purity not specified] in the diet at a concentration of 4000 ppm (0.028 mol/kg of diet) for 72 weeks. A control group of 30 
untreated male rats was included in the st udy. The experiment was terminated at 93 
weeks. The mean daily dose of ortho -toluidine hydrochloride was 0.062 g (0.00043 mol) 
per rat, and the total dose was 31.3 g (0.22 mol) ortho -toluidine hydrochloride per rat. 
Mean body weights were higher in the treated group than in the control group. Survival of 
the treated animals was compar able to controls through month 18, then steadily decreased 
until termination at 22 months. The incidence of fibromas of the skin was 1/27 (4%), 
25/30 (83%; P < 0.001, Fisher exact test); that of  fibromas of the spleen was 0/27, 10/30 
(33%; P < 0.001, Fisher exact test); that of mammary fibroadenomas 0/27, 11/30 (37%; 
P < 0.001, Fisher exact test); and that of  peritoneal sarcomas was 0/27, 9/30 (30%; 
P < 0.01, Fisher exact test) for contro l and treated groups, respectively (Hecht et al. , 
1982). 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female Fischer 344 rats, six weeks of age, were given 
ortho -toluidine hydrochloride (purity > 99%) in the diet at concentrations of 3000 or 
6000 ppm for 101–104 weeks. Matched control groups consisted of 20 male and 20 female untreated rats. Mean body weights of treated male and female rats were lower 
than those of the corresponding controls , and were dose-related. Mortality was 
significantly affected by the treatment ( P < 0.001, Tarone test for positive trend). In 
males, the incidence of sarcomas, fibro sarcomas, angiosarcomas or osteosarcomas 
(combined) of multiple organs (mainly subcutis and spleen or bone) was 0/20, 15/50 
(30%; P = 0.003, Fisher exact test) and 37/49 (76%; P < 0.001, Fisher exact test); that of 
subcutaneous integumentary fibromas was 0/20, 28/50 (56%; P < 0.001, Fisher exact test) 
and 27/49 (55%; P < 0.001, Fisher exact test); and th at of mesotheliomas of multiple 
organs or tunica vaginalis was 0/20, 17/50 (34%; P < 0.001, Fisher exact test) and 9/49 
(18%; P = 0.036, Fisher exact test) in co ntrols, low-dose and high-dose groups, 
respectively. In females, the incidence of  transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary 
bladder was 0/20, 9/45 (20%; P = 0.028, Fisher exact test) and 22/47 (47%; P < 0.001, 
Fisher exact test); that of  sarcomas, fibrosarcomas, os teosarcomas or angiosarcomas 
(combined) of multiple organs (mainly subcutis and spleen or bone) was 0/20, 3/50 (6%) 
and 21/49 (43%; P = 0.001, Fisher exact test); and that of mammary adenomas and 
fibroadenomas (combined) was 7/20 (35%), 20/50 (40%) and 35/49 (71%) ( P = 0.006), in 
controls, low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively (National Cancer Institute, 1979). 
Three groups of 20 male Fischer 344/N rats, 45 days of age, were given ortho -
toluidine hydrochloride (purity > 99%) at a concentration of 5000 ppm in the diet for up 
to 26 weeks. Group 1 was treated with ortho -toluidine hydrochloride for 13 weeks and 
then killed. Group 2 was treated for 13 week s and then kept untreated for an additional 
13 weeks, when animals were killed. Group 3 was treated with ortho
-toluidine 426 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 hydrochloride for 26 weeks and then killed. The average of group mean compound 
consumption was 301 mg/kg/day for Group 1, 304 mg/kg/day for Group 2 and 285 mg/kg/day for Group 3. Groups of 10 untreated male Fischer 344/N rats served as 
controls for each of the treated groups. Hyperp lasia in the transition al epithelium of the 
urinary bladder was observed in 10/20 (50%) ( P < 0.01, Fisher exact test) rats exposed to 
ortho -toluidine hydrochloride for 13 weeks and in 17/20 (85%) ( P < 0.01, Fisher exact 
test) rats exposed for 26 weeks. No hyperp lasia was observed in the concurrent control 
animals (0/10). It was also re ported that mesotheliomas in the epididymis were observed 
in 2/20 (10%) male rats exposed to ortho -toluidine hydrochloride for 13 weeks and held 
for an additional 13 weeks. No  mesotheliomas were seen in concurrent controls (0/10) 
(NTP, 1996). 
3.2 Subcutaneous injection 
3.2.1  Hamster 
Groups of 15 male and 15 female Syrian golden hamsters, eight weeks of age, were 
given subcutaneous injections of 1.9 mmol/kg bw (2 mg/kg bw) ortho -toluidine (free 
base) [recrystallized product, purity not specified ] in peanut oil once per week for 52 
weeks. Control groups of 15 male and 15 fema le hamsters were given 52 subcutaneous 
injections of peanut oil. Animals were observed until moribund. The experiment was 
terminated after 87 weeks. Mean  body weights in the treated groups were similar to those 
of the control groups. Mean survival times were  shorter in the treated groups, being 61.3 
and 57.8 weeks in male and female treated hamsters, respectively, compared with 75.5 
and 68.7 weeks in male and female controls, respectively. The incide nce of tumours in the 
treated groups was not significantly different from that in the cont rol groups [details on 
the incidence of specific tum ours were not reported] (Hecht et al. , 1983). [The Working 
Group noted the small number of animals, low dose and short duration of treatment.] 
3.3 Carcinogenicity of metabolites 
3.3.1  Rat 
Groups of 30 male Fischer 344 rats, ei ght weeks of age, were treated with ortho -
nitrosotoluene [recrystallized product, purity not specified] in the diet at a concentration 
of 3380 ppm (0.028 mol/kg of diet) for 72 weeks. A control group of 30 untreated male rats was used. The experiment was terminat ed at 93 weeks. The mean daily dose of ortho -
nitrosotoluene was 0.051 g (0.00042 mol) per rat and the total dose was 25.7 g (0.21 mol) 
ortho -nitrosotoluene per rat. Mean body weights were higher in the treated group than in 
the control group. The incidence of fibromas of the skin was 1/27 (4%), 19/29 (66%) 
(P < 0.001, Fisher exact test); that of fi bromas of the spleen was 0/27, 14/29 (48%) 
(P < 0.001, Fisher exact test); that of he patocellular carcinomas was 0/27, 18/29 (62%) 
(P < 0.001, Fisher exact test); and that of urinary bladder tumours was 0/27, 15/29 (52%)  ortho- TOLUIDINE 427  
 (P < 0.01, Fisher exact test) in control and treated groups, respectively (Hecht et al. , 
1982). 
3.3.2  Hamster 
Groups of 15 male and 15 female Syrian golden hamsters, eight weeks of age, were 
given subcutaneous injections of 1.9 mmol/kg bw (2 mg/kg bw) ortho -nitrosotoluene 
[recrystallized product, purity not specified]  in peanut oil once pe r week for 52 weeks. 
Control groups of 15 male and 15 female hamsters were given 52 subcutaneous injections of peanut oil. Animals were observed unti l moribund. The experiment was terminated 
after 87 weeks. Mean body weights in the treated groups were similar to those of the 
control groups. Mean survival times were shorter in the treated groups, being 45.4 and 51.1 weeks in male and female treated hams ters, respectively, compared with 75.5 and 
68.7 weeks in male and female controls, respectively. The incidence of tumours in the 
treated groups was not significantly different from that in the cont rol groups [details on 
the incidence of specific tum ours were not reported] (Hecht et al. , 1983). [The Working 
Group noted the small number of animals,  the low dose and the short duration of 
treatment.] 
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination 
4.1.1  Humans 
ortho -Toluidine occurs in the environment and is a constituent of tobacco smoke 
(Patrianakos & Hoffmann, 1979). Riedel et al.  (2006) measured this amine in urine from 
smokers and nonsmokers using gas-chroma tography/mass-spectrometry/negative-ion 
chemical ionization (GC-MS-NICI) with a deuterated ortho -toluidine standard to assess 
recovery. Excretion of ortho -toluidine was significantly hi gher in 10 smokers (204 ng/24 h, 
117 ng/L) than in 10 nonsmokers (104 ng/24 h, 55 ng/L). A large variation was observed among nonsmokers, which was attributed to one subject with ortho -toluidine 
concentrations of 318 ng/L or 731 ng/24 h, th e highest of all subjects. After excluding this 
subject, the difference for ortho -toluidine excretion between smokers and nonsmokers 
remained significant. Urinary arylamine ex cretion in smokers was associated with the 
extent of smoking, as assessed by daily cigarette consumption ( P < 0.177), urinary 
excretion of nicotine equivalents (nic otine plus its five major metabolites; P < 0.021), 
cotinine in saliva ( P < 0.118), and carbon monoxide in exhaled breath ( P < 0.373). All 
nonsmokers had quantifiable amounts of ortho -toluidine in their urine, confirming that 
other environmental sources of exposure also occur. This study evaluated its results in comparison with those of three other studies on ortho -toluidine excretion in smokers and 428 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 nonsmokers (el-Bayoumy et al. , 1986; Riffelmann et al. , 1995; Ward et al. , 1996). While 
only one of those studies reported si gnificant differences between smokers and 
nonsmokers (Riffelmann et al. , 1995), higher absolute values were reported for non-
occupationally exposed nonsmokers in all thr ee studies. Possible reasons for this were 
suggested to be alkaline rather than acid hydrolysis, leading to cleavage of N-acetylated 
metabolites; the method of detection, i.e. electrochemical or electron capture vs GC-MS-
NICI; and non-occupational exposure to ortho -toluidine. 
ortho -Toluidine is a major metabolite of prilocaine ( N-[α-propyl-aminopropionyl]-
ortho -toluidine), a widely used  local anaesthetic. Gaber et al.  (2007) assessed the impact 
of prilocaine-treatment on the formation of haemoglobin (Hb) adducts from ortho -
toluidine by obtaining blood samples from 20 patients undergoing head and neck surgery and six healthy volunteers, be fore and 24 h after receivi ng local anaesthesia with 
prilocaine (Xylonest®, 100 mg). Hb adducts of ortho -toluidine and 4-aminobiphenyl 
were determined by GC/MS. ortho -Toluidine-Hb adducts were significantly increased at 
24 h after prilocaine treatment by 22 ± 13 ng/g Hb ( P < 0.0001), which corresponds to 
about 0.034 ± 0.021% of the prilocaine dose.  This corresponds to a 6–360-fold increase of 
ortho -toluidine adduct levels in  patients. Because of an extr emely high backgr ound level, 
the increase was only 1.6-fold in one patient (40.9 ng/g before vs 64.4 ng/g Hb at 24 h 
after prilocaine injection). Self-reported sm oking status and 4-aminobiphenyl-Hb adducts 
were used to control for smoking-related effects. Current smoking had no influence on background values or on the increase of ortho -toluidine adducts by prilocaine. The latter 
did not alter 4-aminobiphenyl-Hb adduct leve ls, which were significantly higher in eight 
smokers, 0.15 ± 0.1 ng/g Hb, than in 16 nonsmokers, 0.04 ± 0.04 ng/g Hb ( P < 0.01). 
Data for ortho -toluidine are similar to those given in a previous report (Ward et al. , 1996), 
which found similar values of Hb adducts  in smoking and nonsmoking unexposed 
workers; among exposed workers, smokers and non-smokers showed similar results. 
Since smokers have significantly higher CYP1A2 activity compared with nonsmokers 
(Sesardic et al. , 1988), the absence of any effect of smoking status on the increase of 
ortho -toluidine adducts after exposure to prilocaine does not support a role for this 
enzyme in activation of ortho -toluidine. The results are also  consistent with those of 
studies in rats demonstrating no significant increase in ortho -toluidine-Hb adducts after 
induction of CYP1A2 by β-naphthoflavone (DeBord et al. , 1992). Human CYP2A6 and 
2E1 have also been shown to play a role in the activation of another monocyclic amine, 
2,6-dimethylaniline (Gan et al. , 2001). 
4.1.2  Experimental systems 
The metabolism of prilocaine in the mouse has been inv estigated (Akerman et al. , 
1966). In female Sprague-Dawley rats, the tissue distribution of 14C-prilocaine, dosed 
intramuscularly at 10 mg/kg bw, was in th e following decreasing order: lung, kidney, 
spleen, brain, heart, liver and blood. Lung distribution was maximal after 10 min and 
remained at the highest level of 14C-prilocaine during the entire 120 min of the study. The  ortho- TOLUIDINE 429  
 rapid in-vivo decomposition of 14C-prilocaine, when given intraperitoneally at 10 mg/kg 
bw to DSS mice, was unaffected by the CY P inhibitor SKF 525A (25 mg/kg bw, i.p.). 
However, SKF 525A greatly reduced the metabolism of lidocaine (a substituted xylidene, 
ortho -diethylamino-2,6-dimethylacetanilide). In  experiments with rat and mouse liver 
slices in vitro , ortho -toluidine was tentatively identified as a metabolite of lidocaine. 
The ability of ortho -toluidine to affect xenobiotic biotransformation in male Sprague-
Dawley rats was investigated (Leslie et al. , 1988). After intraperitoneal injections of 
10 mg/kg bw ortho -toluidine, daily for 7 consecutiv e days, there was an increase in 
hepatic CYP content and activities of ethoxyresorufin- O-deethylase, ethoxycoumarin- O-
deethylase, and aldrin epoxidase. At 100 mg/kg bw, ortho -toluidine increased metabolic 
activity at several hydroxylation sites of an drostenedione and caused a small decrease in 
testosterone synthesis. Administration of ortho -toluidine at either 10 or 100 mg/kg bw, 
was not associated with a change in aniline para-hydroxylase, epoxide hydrolase, or 
aminopyrine N-demethylase activities. Similar results were observed with male Wistar 
rats given intraperitoneal injections of 75 mg/kg bw ortho -toluidine for three consecutive 
days (Gnojkowski et al. , 1984). The hepatic activities of microsomal aryl hydrocarbon 
hydroxylase (predominantly catalysed by  CYP1A iso-enzyme activity) and NADPH-
cytochrome c reductase and the content of cytochrome b5 were enhanced. No effect was 
observed on epoxide hydrolase, amin opyrine demethylase or glutathione S-transferase 
activities or CYP content. Another study used  caffeine metabolism to investigate whether 
the three isomers of toluidin e induce CYP1A2 activity (Jod ynis-Liebert & Matuszewska, 
1999). Male Wistar rats were fasted overnight and given an oral dose of 1, 10, or 60 
mg/kg bw of each isomer. After 24 hours, rats were orally dosed with 10 mg/kg bw of caffeine and killed three hours later. All toluidines were inducers of CYP1A2. However, 
ortho -toluidine was the most effective with large increases observed at 1 mg/kg bw, and 
its effect was dose-dependent. This study is qu ite different from the two studies discussed 
above with regard to route of administration and total time of exposure to ortho -toluidine. 
In-vivo biotransformation of ortho -toluidine has been assessed in male F344 rats (Son 
et al. , 1980). Following a 50- or 400- mg/kg bw subcuteneous dose of ortho -[methyl-
14C]toluidine, > 75% of the ra dioactivity was recovered in  urine and < 3.5% in faeces 
after 48 hours. Major routes of metabolism were N-acetylation and hydroxylation at the 4-
position. Minor pathways included hydroxylation at the 6-position, oxidation of the methyl group, and oxidation of the amino group. Sulfate conjugates predominated over 
glucuronides. Studies should be desi gned to determin e specific P450s, N-acetyl-
transferases, or other enzymes involved in the metabolism of ortho -toluidine. 
4.2 Genetic and related effects 
The genetic toxicology of ortho -toluidine has been extensively studied in two 
international collaborative trials for evaluatio n of short-term tests for carcinogens (Ashby, 
1981; 1985). A review (Danfo rd, 1991) summarized the conc lusions of these trials. The 
genetic toxicology of ortho -toluidine has also been reviewed  more briefly, in the context 430 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 of carcinogenesis, by Sellers and Markow itz (1992). There seems to be substantial 
variation in results between different labora tories and minor variations in protocols (see 
Table 4.1 for details and references; this Ta ble is reproduced from Monograph Volume 
77; IARC, 2000). 
Most of the data from bacterial or bacter iophage assay-systems show negative or at 
most weakly positive results. ortho -Toluidine gave positive results for induction of 
bacteriophage lambda, but only  when tested in the prese nce of exogenous metabolic 
activation (Thomson, 1981). It failed to induce SOS activity in Salmonella typhimurium  
TA1535/PSK1002 (Nakamura et al. , 1987). At very high concentrations (20 mg per 
plate), it was differentially toxic towards Escherichia coli  strains differing in capacity for 
recombinational repair, in the absence of S9 mix (Rosenkranz & Poirier, 1979). However, 
this result was not reproduced in two further st udies carried out in other laboratories, with 
lower concentrations (Gre en, 1981; Tweats, 1981). ortho -Toluidine gave positive results 
for forward mutation in recomb ination-deficient strains of Bacillus subtilis  (Kada, 1981). 
A large series of studies have been reported using S. typhimurium  strains TA100, 
TA102, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA97. Almost all of the results were 
negative, although there are sporadic reports of  positive responses, on ly in the presence of 
S9 mix, with strains TA100, TA98 , TA1535 and TA1538 (Table 4.2). 
Miller et al.  (1986) tested the mutagenic potentia l of some chemical components of 
dental materials including ortho -toluidine, and found that this compound was not 
mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella /microsome mutagenicity spot test and the plate-
incorporation test with tester strains TA97 , TA98, TA100, and TA104, with or without S9 
mix. Analogues of ortho -toluidine, such as para-toluidine and N,N-dimethyl- para-
toluidine were also not mutagenic. 
Gupta et al.  (1987) tested the mutagenicity of ortho -toluidine and its potential 
metabolites in the Salmonella /mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. The compound 
was not mutagenic in the presence or  absence of rat liver S9 in Salmonella  strains TA98 
and TA100. However, its N-oxidized metabolites, N-hydroxy- ortho- toluidine and 
ortho -nitrotoluene showed a marked mutagenic response in TA100, but only in the 
presence of S9 mix at dose levels of 0.5–2.0 µM per plate; a linear dose–response curve 
was observed. Other potential metabolites such as N-acetyl- ortho -toluidine, N-acetyl- N-
hydroxy- ortho -toluidine, N-acetoxy- N-acetyl- ortho -toluidine, 2-OH-6-methyl-acetanilide, 
ortho -azoxytoluene, and ortho -azotoluene were found to be  inactive in TA100 and TA98, 
with or without activation. 
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , ortho -toluidine induced “petit e” mutants in strain D5 
(Ferguson, 1985) but it was negative for mitotic crossing-over and gene conversion in 
strain D7 (Metha and von Borstel, 1985; Brooks et al. , 1985). The S. cerevisiae  deletion 
(DEL) assay can detect a wide variety of  nonmutagenic carc inogens, including 
carcinogens that are not detectable  with the Ames test (Schiestl et al.  1989). Carls 
and Schiestl (1994) employed the S. cerevisiae  DEL assay to test the genotoxicity 
of ortho- toluidine, and found that it increased the frequency of DEL recombination   ortho- TOLUIDINE 431

 2.6-fold in the absence of S9 and more than five-fold in the presence of S9. In the absence 
of S9 an increase in DEL recombination-frequ ency was first seen at a concentration of 
3 mg/ml, whereas in the presence of S9 an increase appeared at 1 mg/ml. The frequency 
of intrachromosomal recombinatio n was not increased in this test. 
In S. cerevisiae , treatment with ortho -toluidine resulted in differential toxicity in 
repair-proficient and -deficient strains (Sharp and Parry, 1981a). However, inconsistent 
data were seen in all other assays with this species of yeast. Of eight assays for gene 
conversion carried out in different laborato ries, one positive result  was reported only 
when exogenous metabolic activation was pr esent (Mehta and von Borstel, 1981) and 
another only when it was absent (Sharp and Parry, 1981b). Although ortho -toluidine 
caused a recombinogenic event leading to dele tion (in either the pr esence or absence of 
exogenous metabolic activation), it failed to  cause intra-chromosoma l recombination in 
the same yeast strain (Carls and Schiestl, 1 994). It was a mitochond rial “petite” mutagen 
(Ferguson, 1985), but failed to give a positive response for forward mutation in a nuclear gene (Inge-Vechtomov et al. , 1985). It gave a positive r esult in one of seven assays for 
reverse mutation. However, it ca used aneuploidy in two of th ree assays (Parry and Sharp, 
1981; Parry and Eckardt, 1985b). Assays for forward mutation or genetic crossing-over in Aspergillus nidulans  gave completely negative results, as did a forward mutation assay in 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe . 
Uniformly negative results were found for reverse mutation in E. coli  strains WP2 or 
WP2 uvrA. Where positive responses have been seen in microbial assays, they have 
generally required variations to the standard  test procedures, incl uding the use of the 
fluctuation protocol, or incorporating the addition of norharman or lithocholic acid. High concentrations of S9 mix, or special types of S9 mix may also be important. 
In the Escherichia coli  K-12 uvrB/recA  DNA repair host-mediated assay, ortho -
toluidine was shown to be not mutagenic, w ith or without metabolic activation (Hellmér 
and Bolcsfoldi, 1992). 
ortho -Toluidine caused DNA strand breakage in various animal cell lines in vitro , in 
the absence of exogenous metabolic activ ation. The alkaline single-cell gel 
electrophoresis (comet) assay revealed DNA breakage after ortho -toluidine treatment in a 
metabolically competent human mammary cell line, MCL-5, as well as in primary 
cultures of cells isolated from human breast  milk. The response was substantially 
increased when the cells were incubated in the presence of the DNA -repair inhibitors 
hydroxyurea and cytosine arabinoside. Only on e of eight studies showed that treatment 
with ortho -toluidine could lead to unscheduled DNA synthesis (Glauert et al. , 1985). A 
single study suggested a weak positive effect in gene mutation at the Hprt locus in V79 
Chinese hamster cells, although two other similar studies gave negative results. ortho -
Toluidine failed to cause mu tation to ouabain resistance in V79 Chinese hamster cells 
(Zdzienicka and Simons, 1985). Two of six st udies suggested a positive response at the 
Tk
 locus but not usually at other loci in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. However, there 
are isolated reports of ortho -toluidine increasing gene mu tations at loci other than Tk in 444 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 L5178Y cells or in other animal cells in vitro , but only in the presence of exogenous 
metabolic activation. 
There have been occasional reports of ortho -toluidine causing chromosomal 
aberrations (Danford, 1985; Gulati et al. , 1985; Ishidate and Sofuni, 1985; Palitti et al. , 
1985; Priston and Dean, 1985) or micronuclei (Fritzenschaf et al. , 1993) in various 
cultured cell lines. Manifest ation of these effects required  incubation times longer than 
three hours. In some of these studies, S9 mix was required, while in others it reduced the 
effect. Most studies of effects on sister ch romatid exchange, in either animal or human 
cells, have revealed positive results, ev en in the absence of exogenous metabolic 
activation. ortho -Toluidine caused aneuploidy in mammalian cells in vitro  (Danford, 
1985), and increased cell transfor mation in all but one of 11 st udies. The latter effects did 
not generally appear to require exogenous metabolic activation, although it should be 
noted that the cell types have some endogen ous metabolic capability. In two of three 
studies, ortho -toluidine inhibited intracel lular communication (Elmore et al. , 1985; Scott 
et al. , 1985). 
Several in-vivo studies have been conducted. ortho -Toluidine gave a positive result in 
a host-mediated assay for bacterial mutagenesi s. It increased somatic  mutation (Fujikawa 
et al. , 1985; Vogel, 1985) but not genetic crossing-over in Drosophila melanogaster , and 
enhanced sister chromatid exch ange in rodent models (McFee et al. , 1989). Only one of 
four studies in mice and one study in a newt model (Fernandez et al. , 1989), suggested 
that it enhanced micronucleus frequency. Studies on sperm morphology have given 
equivocal data (Topham, 1980; 1981). 
Although ortho -toluidine shows negative results in most genotoxicity tests, there are 
several reports that show posi tive results. The bacterial mutagenicity tests, predominantly 
negative, were in general agreement with other studies with monocyclic aromatic amines. 
Only 37 of 87 of the short-term  tests used in a large collab orative study showed a positive 
result (Ashby et al. , 1985). ortho -Toluidine was negative in the Ames mutagenicity test 
(Brennan and Schiestl, 1999) but it gave posi tive results in assays detecting unscheduled 
DNA synthesis or strand breaks (Danford, 1991). 
The ortho -toluidine metabolite 4-amino-3-meth ylphenol increased the formation of 
8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2 ′-deoxyguanosine in calf-thymus DNA in the presence of Cu(II). This 
metabolite auto-oxidizes to form the aminom ethylphenoxyl radical, which reacts with O 2 
to form the superoxide (O 2-.) radical and H 2O2. The reactive species generated by H 2O2 in 
the presence of Cu (I) contributes to the formation of DNA damage. Metal-mediated 
DNA damage by ortho -toluidine metabolites through H 2O2 may play a role in the 
carcinogenicity of ortho -toluidine (Ohkuma et al. , 1999). 
DNA-adduct formation was measured in in -vitro and in-vivo experiments with 
ortho -toluidine and other amines. Calf-thymus DNA was modified in vitro  by reaction 
with activated ortho -toluidine. Female Wistar rats ( n = 2) were given a single dose of the 
arylamine by oral gavage and were killed after 24 hours. Hepatic DNA and DNA 
modified in vitro  were hydrolysed enzyma tically to individual 2 ′-deoxyribonucleosides. 
Adducts were determined by use of HPLC/MS/MS by comparison with synthesized  ortho- TOLUIDINE 445  
 standards. ortho -Toluidine formed adducts to 2 ′-deoxyguanosine and 2 ′-deoxyadenosine 
after in-vitro reaction with DN A. It also formed hydroly sable haemoglobin adducts in 
treated rats (Jones and Sabbioni 2003). 
Bolognesi et al.  (1980) investigated the DNA damage induced by administration to 
mice of 2,4-dinitroaniline, ortho -toluidine, and para-toluidine. DNA damage was 
measured by use of the alkaline filter-elution technique. Target orga ns for the ultimate 
carcinogens in mice appear to be the liver an d kidney. The DNA damage was evident four 
hours after administration of a single dose of ortho -toluidine and para-toluidine. The 
value obtained after treatment with 2.4-dinitroaniline fell within the range of controls. 
Brock et al.  (1990) studied the hepatic macromolecular binding and tissue distribution 
of ortho -toluidine and para- toluidine in rats. The degree of binding to hepatic 
macromolecules appeared to be at a maxi mum for both compounds at 24–48 hours 
following dosing. At 24 hours, the level of DNA binding of ortho- toluidine was about 
1.2-fold lower than that of para-toluidine. The binding to RNA and protein was also 
lower for ortho -toluidine than for para-toluidine, although the difference was not as large 
as that observed for DNA binding. There were subtle differences in tissue distribution for 
each isomer. 
The formation of ortho -toluidine-Hb adducts was first detected by Birner and 
Neumann (1988) in a study with rats. The HbI (haemoglobin-binding index) was in the 
same range as that observed for aniline and ortho -chlorotoluidine. 
Haemoglobin (Hb) and albumin (Alb) adducts of ortho -toluidine were quantified in 
blood samples collected from rats after a single injection (Cheever et al. , 1992). Mild 
alkaline hydrolysis of Hb adducted with [14C]-labelled ortho -toluidine followed by 
extraction with ethyl acetate resulted in rec overy of 63% of the bound radioactivity. A 
single radio-labelled peak identified as ortho -toluidine by GC-MS was found after HPLC 
analysis. In subsequent experiments Hb and Alb adduct levels were determined by HPLC analysis of this cleavage product by means of fluorescence detection. The detection limit 
for ortho -toluidine was 450 pg/injection or 5 pmol/mg Hb. Mean adduct levels for Hb 
increased rapidly over the first four hours, with the highest level (ng/mg Hb ± SD) 
3.7 ± 0.5 detected 24 hours after administration of ortho- toluidine at a dose of 50 mg/kg 
bw. The adduct levels for pooled Alb sampl es increased from 0.7 ng/mg Alb at two hours 
to 2.5 ng/mg Alb at four hours, but were not detectable at 24 hours after dosing. Hb adducts showed a linear relationship with ortho -toluidine doses of 10, 20, 40, 50, and 100 
mg/kg bw. The Hb-adduct half-life was 11 days after a single 100 mg/kg bw dose. Hb-
adduct levels were still quantifiable (1.3  ± 0.2 ng/mg Hb) by HPLC/fluorescence at 28 
days after a 100-mg/kg bw dose of ortho -toluidine (Cheever et al. , 1992). 
The binding characteristics of ortho -toluidine to rat haemoglobin (Hb) and albumin 
(Alb) were studied by DeBord et al.  (1992). Sprague-Dawley rats were given [
14C]-
labelled ortho -toluidine intraperitonea lly at 10, 20, 40, 50, or 100 mg/kg bw, and were 
killed at 2, 4, 8, 18, 24, 48, or 72 hours, or 7, 14, 28 days. Haemoglobin and albumin were 
isolated from blood, and ortho -toluidine was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 
For albumin, a maximum binding occurred at 50 mg/kg bw at the 4-h time point (15.6 ng 446 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 ortho -toluidine/mg Alb); the maximum binding to Hb was observed at 24 h at the 
100-mg/kg bw dose (23.0 ± 5.1 ng ortho -toluidine/mg Hb). ortho -Toluidine-Alb binding 
was not linear, but ortho -toluidine-Hb appeared to incr ease linearly in a dose-dependent 
manner. The biological half-lives of ortho -toluidine bound to Alb or Hb were observed to 
be 2.6 and 12.3 days, respectively, after rats were given a single dose of [14C]-labelled 
ortho -toluidine. An ap proximately two-fold increase in radioactivity bound to Hb was 
observed after i.p. administration of 100 mg/kg bw [14C]-labelled ortho -toluidine 
compared with oral intubation. 
Suzuki et al.  (2005) evaluated the liver and pe ripheral blood micronucleus assays 
with nine chemicals including ortho -toluidine in young male Fischer F344 or SD rats. 
ortho -Toluidine significantly increased the numbers of micronucleated hepatocytes 
(MNHEPs), micronucleated reticulocytes (MNRETs) and the number of reticulocytes 
(RETs) in the peripheral blood of the test anim als. Results of this study were in agreement 
with the report that ortho -toluidine induced hepatocellular carcinoma and hemangio-
sarcoma in mice, and cancer in multiple organs in rats (IARC, 2000). However, Nakai 
et al.  (1994) reported that ortho -toluidine was negative in a mouse bone-marrow 
micronucleus assay. 
McFee et al.  (1989) tested the in-vivo genotoxicity of ortho -toluidine in B6C3F1 
mice, and found that bone-marrow cells from mi ce given intraperitoneal injections to up 
to the maximum tolerated dose of ortho- toluidine hydrochloride did not show an 
increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations or micronuclei, but the frequency of 
sister chromatid exchange was increased in two successive tests. 
ortho -Toluidine induced an increase of in tra-chromosomal recombination in S. 
cerevisiae  strains RS112 and EG133 of greater than  three- and six-fold at doses of 5 and 
6 mg/ml, respectively, althou gh statistical significance ( P < 0.05) was reached only at the 
highest dose. The frequency of recombination was reduced by the presence of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. The cytotoxicity of ortho -toluidine was also reduced in the 
presence of this free-radical scavenger. Su peroxide dismutase-deficient strains of S. 
cerevisiae,  however, were hypersensitive to  the cytotoxicity induced by ortho -toluidine 
(Brennan and Schiestl, 1999). These results  indicate that the genotoxicity of ortho -
toluidine was at least in part due to the formation of free radicals. 
In Drosophila melanogaster , both positive and negative responses were obtained in 
the somatic cell w/w
co test with repair-proficient strains (Vogel, 1985; Würgler and Vogel, 
1986). Inconclusive results were al so obtained for the reversion at w/wz in the excision-
repair deficient mei-9 strain (Fujikawa et al. , 1985; Batiste-Alentorn et al. , 1991). 
Mutagenicity of several aromatic amines was tested by means of the w/w+ somatic assay 
of D. melanogaster  with the wild-type strain Leiden  Standard (LS) and an insecticide-
resistant stock Hikone-R (HK-R). ortho -Toluidine was found to be positive in this test 
(Rodriguez-Arnaiz & Aranda, 1994). Batiste-Alentorn et al.  (1995) further conducted the 
D. melanogaster  wing-spot somatic mutation and recombination assay on 10 selected 
carcinogens including ortho -toluidine. Third-instar larvae, 72 hours old and trans-
heterozygous for two recessive  wing-cell markers, i.e. multiple wing hairs (mwh ) and  ortho- TOLUIDINE 447  
 flare3 (flr3), were given three concentrations of each  carcinogen in the feed during the rest 
of their development until pupation, and ge notoxic effects were measured as significant 
increases in the appearance of visible mutant -hair clones on the adult wing-blade. It was 
found that six of the carcinogens tested, including ortho -toluidine, produced significant 
increases in wing-spot frequency. 
Ward et al.  (1996) monitored aromatic amine exposures in workers at a chemical 
plant with a known bladder-cancer excess. Data were obtained for a total of 73 workers, 
including 46 of 64 exposed workers who we re employed in the rubber-chemicals 
department and had the potential for exposure to aniline and ortho -toluidine, and 27 of 
52 unexposed workers employed in other departments where aniline and ortho -toluidine 
were not used or produced. They  found that post-shift urinary ortho -toluidine 
concentrations averaged (± standard deviation) 2.8 µg/L (± 1.4 µg/L) in unexposed 
subjects and 98.7 µg/L (± 119. 4 µg/L) in exposed subjects ( P = 0.0001). Average aniline-
Hb adducts and ortho -toluidine-Hb adducts were also significantly higher ( P = 0.0001) 
among exposed workers than among unexposed control subjects (3163 pg/g ± 1302 pg/g 
for unexposed vs 17 441 ± 8867 pg/g for exposed in  the case of aniline-Hb adducts; 
3515 ± 6036 pg/g for unexposed vs 40, 830 ± 32 518 pg/g for exposed in the case of  
ortho -toluidine-Hb adducts). Average levels of adducts to 4-aminobiphenyl, a potential 
contaminant of process ch emicals, were not significantly different ( P = 0.48). The adduct 
data suggest that among these workers, ortho -toluidine exposure substantially exceeded 
aniline exposure and that 4-aminobiphenyl exposure, if it occurred at all, was not 
widespread. The authors concluded that occupational exposure to ortho -toluidine was the 
most likely causal agent of the bladder- cancer excess observed among workers in the 
rubber-chemicals department of the plant under study (Ward et al. , 1996). 
Marques et al.  (1996) investigated the ability of N-(acyloxy)arylamine derived from 
2-, 3- and 4-methylaniline ( ortho -toluidine is 2-methylaniline), 2,3- and 2,4-dimethyl-
aniline to bind to DNA by reacting with deoxygu anosine (dG), and dG nucleotides. The 
predominant products from reactions with dG  and the nucleotides were characterized as 
N-(deoxyguanosine-8-yl)-aryl amines. Analyses of the [1H]- and [13C]-NMR spectra 
suggested that the a dducts containing a methyl substituent ortho  to the arylam ine nitrogen 
(i.e. toluidine) had a higher percentage of syn conformers. With ot her aromatic amines, 
the occurrence of syn conformers has been associated wi th higher propen sity for base 
mispairing and higher tumorigenic responses (Cho et al., 1994; Eckel and Krugh 1994). It 
was observed that some aromatic amines co ntaining methyl substituents in the ortho  
position tend to be more mutagenic and tumorigenic than analogues with no substituents in the ortho  position (El-Bayoumy et al. , 1981; Nussbaum et al. , 1983). Theoretical 
simulation studies indicated substantial percentages of low-energy syn conformers, 
increasing with the substitution pattern in the order para < meta < ortho  < ortho-para  
< ortho-meta . The results demonstrate that although  single-ring arylamines are considered 
weak carcinogens, their electrophilic N-acetoxy derivatives, which are plausible 
metabolic intermediates, react with DNA to yi eld covalent adducts structurally identical 
to those derivatives from carcinogenic pol yarylamines such as 2-aminofluorene and 448 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 4-aminobiphenyl. Furthermore, the conforma tional perturbation induced in DNA by the 
formation of monoarylamine-DNA adducts, especially those with ortho  substituents, may 
contribute to the biological activ ities of these compounds (Marques et al. , 1996). [The 
Working Group noted as a caveat  that these conformational studies were done with the 
nucleosides but not with oligonucleotides.]  
Marques et al.  (1997) further studied the effects of the substitution site on the 
oxidation potentials of these alkylanilines,  the mutagenicities of the corresponding 
N-hydroxyalkylanilines, and the conformations of the alkylaniline-DNA adducts. It was 
found that the adducts from ortho -substituted alkylanilines may be intrinsically more 
mutagenic than their meta- and para-substituted analogues.  There were higher 
percentages of low-energy syn conformers in the adducts that contained alkyl groups 
ortho  to the arylamine nitrogen as opposed to adducts not bearing ortho  substituents. It 
was suggested that the conformational properties of the DNA adducts, in particular their 
ability to adopt the sy n conformation, may be determinant factors for the genotoxic 
responses elicited by certain alkylanilines (i.e. ortho -toluidine [2-methylaniline] and 2,6-
dimethylaniline). Beland et al.  (1997) confirmed, on the basis of spectroscopic and 
theoretical data, that DNA adducts of these single-ring amines cont aining alkyl groups 
ortho  to the amine function (e.g. ortho -toluidine) had a greater percentage of syn 
conformers around the glycosyl bond than those not bearing such groups. 
4.3 Mechanistic considerations 
The classification of ortho -toluidine as carcinogenic to humans has been controversial 
for some time. Recently, the classification has been upgraded to Category 1 (carcinogenic 
to humans) of the MAK List in Germany (DFG, 2007). Epidemiological observations 
were impaired by the fact that workers, for instance in the rubber industry, were usually 
exposed to other aromatic amines as well,  mostly aniline or 4-aminobiphenyl. 
Haemoglobin adducts have been used to monitor rubber-industry workers from the rubber-chemical department. Their average blood levels of ortho -toluidine-Hb adducts 
were significantly higher than those in non-exposed controls, whereas 4-aminobiphenyl-
Hb adduct levels were not higher than in controls (Ward et al. , 1996). Interestingly, the 
adduct levels were increased even under cond itions where airborne exposures were below 
the OSHA time-weighted average permissible e xposure limits. There has been discussion 
about the possibility that workers with bl adder tumours could have been exposed to 
4-aminobiphenyl in the 1950s and early 1960s, when diphenylamine was produced that 
often contained 4-aminobiphenyl as a contaminant (Freudenthal & Anderson, 1997). It 
remains remarkable that even today haemoglobin adducts of ortho -toluidine are increased 
at certain workplaces under impr oved hygiene conditions. This  may partly be due to the 
fact that these amines are readily absorbed through the skin, part icularly if the skin barrier 
is damaged. Frequent use of skin-barrier  creams increases the abso rption and internal 
exposure (Korinth et al. , 2007). Drugs may also contribute to the exposure; prilocaine, a  ortho- TOLUIDINE 449  
 local anaesthetic, is hydrolysed in vivo  and leads to a massive increase of the amount of 
ortho -toluidine-Hb adducts (Gaber et al. , 2007). 
In line with the hypothesis that alkylation in the ortho -position relative to the amino 
group enhances the activity, ortho -toluidine is more potent than aniline and para-
toluidine. It produces predominantly sarco ma in rats. The acute toxic effects of ortho -
toluidine are comparable to those of ot her monocyclic aromatic amines, i.e. 
methaemoglobin formation, haemosiderosis, fibrosis, while both liver and kidneys are 
affected. In contrast to the carcinogenic potency, however, ortho -toluidine is less toxic 
than aniline, and as toxic as para-toluidine. The h aemoglobin binding- indices for these 
three compounds  – 4, 22 and 2, respectively – reflect this well (Neumann, 2005). It is 
concluded that both genotoxic and acute toxic effects are necessary to explain the 
experimental tumour formation induced by ortho -toluidine.  
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
The aromatic amine  ortho -toluidine is used in the production of dyes, pigments and 
rubber chemicals, and in laboratories to stain tissues. The main route of occupational 
exposure is by dermal contact. ortho -Toluidine is detected ubiquitously in the general 
population, but its origin is not known. It is  not known to exist as a natural substance. 
Detectable levels of ortho -toluidine have been found in su rface water, in effluents and soil 
near industrial facilities, in br east milk and in other food items. ortho -Toluidine is also 
present in tobacco smoke, althou gh this does not appear to be  a main source of exposure. 
ortho -Toluidine was detected in patients fo llowing treatment with the anaesthetic 
prilocaine, a metabolic precursor of ortho -toluidine. Analytical techniques have been 
developed to detect ortho -toluidine in very small quantities in toys. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
The five principal relevant cohort studies of chemical production workers available 
for evaluation were carried out in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States (two studies). Four of these studies repo rted highly elevated bladder-cancer risks in 
ortho -toluidine-exposed workers; the earlier study from the USA had limited power to 
detect any excess risk. Smoking differences c ould be excluded with confidence as the sole 
explanation of the elevated risks. In the Italian study, confounding by concomitant 
exposure to various recognized occupational  bladder carcinogens was considered to be 
possible. This is not the case for the positi ve German, United Kingdom and US studies, 
because any known bladder carcinogens were present only at trace levels. In addition, 450 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 other exposures were very different from study to study. The epidemiological data 
provide strong evidence that ortho -toluidine causes bladder cancer. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
ortho -Toluidine was tested fo r carcinogenicity as its hydrochloride salt in two 
experiments in mice and in four experiments in rats, and as the free base in one limited experiment in hamsters. When administered in the diet to mice, ortho -toluidine 
hydrochloride increased the in cidences of hepatocellular carcinomas or adenomas and 
hemangiosarcomas at multiple sites. When  administered in the diet to rats, ortho -toluidine 
hydrochloride increased the incidences of sar comas of multiple organs, subcutaneous 
fibromas and mesotheliomas, transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder, and 
mammary gland fibroadenomas and adenomas. When ortho -toluidine was administered 
as the free base by subcutaneous injection to hamsters, the number of tumours produced 
was not significantly differen t from that in controls. ortho -Nitrosotoluene, a metabolite of 
ortho -toluidine, was tested in one study in rats and one study in hamsters. When 
administered in the diet to rats, ortho -nitrosotoluene increased th e incidence of fibromas 
of the skin and spleen, hepatocellular carcinomas and urinary bladder tumours. When 
administered by subcutaneous administration to hamsters, ortho -nitrosotoluene did not 
produce an increase in tumours. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
In contrast to most other aromatic amines, ortho -toluidine is metabolised in rats and 
humans by CYPs other than 1A2. Candidates for the responsible CY Ps are CYP2A6 and 
2E1. The major routes of metabo lism (assessed in the rat) were N-acetylation and 
hydroxylation at the 4-position. The oxidation of the amino group was a minor pathway. Adducts to haemoglobin, albumin and DNA are formed in rodents after ortho -toluidine 
administration in vivo . An additional pathway to DNA-damage induction by ortho -
toluidine is inferred by the observation that the ortho -toluidine metabolite 4-amino-3-
methylphenol increased the forma tion of 8-oxo- 7,8-dihydro-2 ′-deoxyguanosine in calf 
thymus DNA in the presence of  Cu(II). The levels of ortho -toluidine-Hb adducts were 
tenfold higher among exposed workers than among unexposed control subjects. Prilocaine, a widely used local anaesthetic, is metabolized to ortho -toluidine, leading to 
ortho -toluidine-Hb adducts after prilocaine treatment. In line with what is generally 
observed with monocyclic aromatic amines, ortho -toluidine was inactive in most bacterial 
genotoxicity tests, although there are a few repor ts showing positive results, most of them 
either at very high doses or after introduction of  variations in the standard test procedures. 
ortho -Toluidine pr oduced increases in intra-chro mosomal recombination in S. cerevisiae . 
In cultured mammalian cells, ortho -toluidine showed predominantly negative results with 
some exceptions: in liver and peripheral blood of rats ortho -toluidine significantly 
increased the number of micronucleated hepatocytes and micronucleated reticulocytes.  ortho- TOLUIDINE 451  
 DNA damage measured by the alkaline fi lter-elution technique was induced by 
administration of ortho -toluidine to mice. In line with the hypothesis that alkylation in the 
ortho -position to the amino group  enhances carcinogenicity, ortho -toluidine is a more 
potent animal carcinogen than are aniline and p-toluidine. Both genotoxicity and acute 
toxic effects, necessary to explain the experimental tumour formation by ortho -toluidine, 
have clearly been shown. 
6. Evaluation 
6.1 Cancer in humans 
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of ortho -toluidine. 
ortho -Toluidine causes cancer of the urinary bladder. 
6.2 Cancer in experimental animals 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of 
ortho -toluidine. 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
ortho -Toluidine is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).   
 
The Working Group was aware of the existen ce of numerous dyes and colourants that 
contain ortho -toluidine as a structural element, but a full evaluation of this group of dyes 
was beyond the scope of this Monograph. Th e local anaesthetic prilocaine, which is 
metabolized to ortho -toluidine, has been shown to cause methaemoglobinaemia and 
haemoglobin-adduct formation in treated patients.

1.1.5  Analysis 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine can be readily detected at the ppb (10
−9) level by means of 
GC/MS methods, with or without prior derivatization. Two recent studies have involved 
methods for detecting this amine in complex mixtures and as reduction products of azo dyes used as toy colourants. Table 1.1 prese nts a selection of recent studies on the 
analysis of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in various matrices. 
1.2 Production and use 
1.2.1  Production 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine is pr oduced by direct chlorina tion of acetyl-protected 
ortho -toluidine. After removal of the protecting group with base, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine 
is separated by distillation from the 6-chloro- ortho -toluidine isomer (Bowers, 2000). 
Commercial production of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine began in Germany in 1924 and 
was first reported in the United States in 1939 (IARC, 1990, 2000). An IARC Working 
Group reported that commercial production of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in the USA 
stopped in 1979, and all importation and distribution of the compound were discontinued in 1986 (IARC, 1990). 
The USEPA (2003, 2007) Inventory Update Rule regulation requires manufacturers 
and importers of certain chemical substances listed in the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory to report manufacturing inform ation (aggregate production volumes) for 
chemicals manufactured (including imported) in amounts of 10 000 pounds or greater (in 
1986) or 25 000 pounds or greater (in 2003) at a single site. Table 1.2 presents the aggregate production volumes that were reported for 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. 
Available information in dicates that 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was produced and/or 
supplied in research quantities in the following c ountries: Belgium, China, Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region, Japan, Swit zerland, the United Ki ngdom, and the USA

 1.2.2  Use 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine and its hydrochloride salt have been used commercially to 
produce azo dyes for cotton, silk, acetate, and nylon, and as intermediates in the 
production of Pigment Red 7 and Pigment Yellow 49. As an azoic diazo component, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine is used in the synthesis of  some azoic dyes, which are prepared 
by a two-step process involving diazotizat ion of a primary amine component and 
coupling of the diazotized amine with a na phthol-derived coupling component (IARC, 
1990, 2000; National Cancer Institute, 1979). Since the 1960s, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine 
has also been used in the manufacture chlo rdimeform, a pesticide and acaricide (IARC, 
1990). As the hydrochloride salt, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine occurs as a contaminant of 
chlordimeform. It is also a metabolite of th is insecticide, which h as recently been banned 
in several countries (IARC, 1983, 1990, 2000; Bowers, 2000). Chlordimeform is no 
longer used in the USA since 1989 (EPA, 2007).

1.3 Occurrence and human exposure 
1.3.1  Natural occurrence 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine and its hydrochloride salt are not known to occur as natural 
products. 
1.3.2  Occupational exposure 
Occupations with the greatest potential for exposure to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine 
include those involved in the production and use of this chemical as an intermediate for 
the manufacture of dyestuffs, pigments, and in the production of chlordimeform. Since  4-CHLORO- ortho -TOLUIDINE 475  
 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine is a major metabolite of this  insecticide, exposure can also occur 
in field workers applying chlordimeform.  
(a) Exposure during the manufacture of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, and 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine-based dyes 
Workers in production a nd processing of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in Germany were 
reported to have been exposed to this substance between 1929 and 1982 (Stasik, 1988). 
The same author report ed that 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was detected at concentrations of 
1700 and 2100 μg/L, respectively, in the urine of two workers, at 12 and 48 hrs after 
exposure to [unknown concentrations  of] chlordimeform (Stasik, 1991). 
In a dye factory in Switzerland, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was manufactured from 
ortho -toluidine between 1924 and 1953 (Uebelin and Pletscher, 1954); in an organic-dye 
factory in the USA, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was used in the thioindigo production-area 
(Ott & Langner, 1983). No exposure measurements were reported for either study. 
(b) Exposure during the manufacture and use of chlordimeform 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine has been de tected in the urine of  workers exposed to 
chlordimeform in the production, packaging and agricultural use of this insecticide. 
After substantial improvement of working conditions in a chlordimeform-
manufacturing plant in 1980, the concentrations of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine and 
chlordimeform were measured in the urine of production workers and reported to be 
minimal (Popp et al. , 1992). Quantitative information on  concentrations before and after 
the improvements was not given. 
Among employees of a chemical plant, nine of 22 workers who packaged 
chlordimeform became suddenly ill; chlordimeform and 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine were 
present in their urine three da ys after exposure (Folland et al. , 1978). 
Kurtz et al.  (1987) monitored agricultural worker s exposed to chlord imeform used as 
a pesticide on cotton in California, US A, during the 1982 application season. 
Chlordimeform and its metabolites were detected in the urine. 
Geyer and Fattal (1987) found 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine at a concentration of 240 
μg/L in the urine of an agricultural worker exposed to chlordimefor m in a cotton-growing 
area. 
Among 1000 urine samples from 130 cotton growers, two thirds had no detectable 
levels of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. For six mixer/loader/applicators, the concentration was 
higher than 1 ppm (Coye et al. , 1986). 
(c) Other uses 
Workers can be exposed to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine during its laboratory use as an 
immunochemical stain. Under the name Fast Red TR, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine is also 
reported to be used in a colorimetric me thod to assess the authentic ity of drugs (Green et 
al., 2000). In a study from Finland (Kauppinen et al. , 2003), one of five molecular-476 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 biology laboratories used 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, albeit in very small amounts (< 1 g per 
year). According to the 1981–83 National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES, 1983), 250 chemists employed in health services in th e United States were po tentially exposed to 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. 
1.3.3  Environmental occurrence and expos ure in the general population 
The general population can be exposed to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine via the 
environment and in food products as a decomposition product of chlordimeform. Riffelmann et al.  (1995) reported concentrations of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in the urine 
of occupationally non-exposed smokers ( n = 8) and nonsmokers ( n = 8) as 3.0 μg/L (0.0–
8.0 μg/L) and 2.2 μg/L (0.0–6.3 μg/L). 
(a) Water 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine can occur in water as a result of the hydrolysis of 
chlordimeform via hydrolysis of the intermediate N-formyl-4-chloro- ortho -toluidine 
(WHO, 1998). 
(b) Soil 
The microbial degradation of chlordimeform in soils by several bacterial and fungal 
species has led to formation of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine (Johnson & Knowles, 1970). 
(c) Plants and foods 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine has been identified in  field samples of plant materials 
treated with chlordimeform, e. g. in young bean leaves at concentrations of < 0.1–0.2 ppm 
[mg/kg], in grape stems at 0.02–0.3 ppm, in a mixture of grape stems and berries at 0.02–
0.5 ppm and in prunes and apples at < 0.04 ppm (Kossmann et al. , 1971). In an 
experimental field application (one, two or three treatments with chlordimeform, harvest 
42 days after last treatment), 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was detected in rice grains at 25, 53 
and 61 ppb [ μg/kg], respectively, and in straw parts at 1600, 7200 and 6900 ppb, 
respectively (Iizuka & Masuda, 1979). 4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine was detected as a 
metabolic product in cotton plants following treatment with chlordimeform (Bull, 1973) 
and similarly in cucumbers and apples (Grübner, 1977). 4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine could 
also potentially occur in honey , as chlordimeform is used in some countries against the 
mite Varroa jacobsoni  Oud., which seriously affects honey beehives (Jiménez et al. , 
2002). 4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine was not detected in cargo rice and husks sprayed or 
treated on the soil with chlordimeform (limit of detection, 0.028 ppm) (Fan & Ge, 1982). 
(d) Finger paint 
Garrigós et al.  (2000) detected 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in five commercially 
available fingerpaints at concentrations between  0.3–0.6 ng/g dry paint  [total number of  4-CHLORO- ortho -TOLUIDINE 477  
 samples not indicated; values read from gr aph]. In an earlier study, 4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine was detected in one of three tested  fingerpaints (0.3 ng/g dry paint) (Garrigós et 
al., 1998). 
1.4 Regulations and guidelines 
1.4.1  Europe 
(a) Directive 2002/61/EC 
Directive 2002/61/EC restricts the marketing and use of azo-colourants (European 
Commission, 2002). In this Directive, A nnex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is amended. 
Azodyes that, by reductive cl eavage of one or more azo groups, may release 4-chloro-
ortho -toluidine in detectable concentrations, i.e. above 30 ppm in the finished articles or 
in the dyed parts thereof, ac cording to the testing method  established in accordance with 
Article 2a of this Directive, may not be used in textile and leather articles that may come 
into direct and prolonged contact wi th the human skin or oral cavity. 
(b) Directive 2004/37/EC 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine is regulated by Directive 2004/37/EC (European 
Commission, 2004), which applies to activ ities in which workers are exposed to 
carcinogens or mutagens of Category 1 and 2. Rules are fixed regarding the employers' obligations of reduction and replacement,  prevention and reduction of exposure, 
unforeseen exposure, foreseeable exposure, access to risk areas, hygi ene and individual 
protection, information for the competent authority, informati on and training of workers, 
consultation and participation of workers, health surveillance, record keeping and limit 
values. 
(c) Directive 2005/90/EC 
In the Directive 2005/90/EC,  the list of substances classified as carcinogenic, 
mutagenic or toxic to reproduction of Directive 76/769/EEC was amended to include 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine (European Commission, 2005). 
1.4.2  Germany 
Deviating from the EU classification, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine is classified as a 
Category-1 carcinogen by the MAK Comm ission (MAK, 2007). The MAK Commission 
listed 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine as a substance for which percutaneous absorption may 
significantly contribute to systemic exposure. A MAK value was not set. Furthermore, it 
was classified as germ-cell mutagen, Class 3A  (Substances that have been shown to 
induce genetic damage in germ cells of humans or animals, or that produce mutagenic 
effects in somatic cells of mammals in vivo  and have been shown to reach the germ cells 
in an active form). 478 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 1.4.3  Japan 
The Japan Society for Occupational Health  (2007) follows the classification by IARC 
of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in Group 2A. 
1.4.4  USA 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine and 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine hydrochloride are listed in the 
NTP Report on Carcinogens as reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens  (NTP, 
2005).  
2. Studies of Cancer in Humans 
2.1 Cohort studies 
Uebelin & Pletscher (1954) studied the occurre nce of bladder tumours in workers at a 
factory in Switzerland producing dyestuff intermediates. The au thors distinguished a 
group of 35 men who prepared 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine from ortho -toluidine during the 
years 1924–1953; no bladder tumours were found am ong these men [The Working Group 
noted that insufficient details concerning person-years at risk and period of follow-up 
were provided to evaluate the significance of this observation]. 
Ott & Langner (1983) studied the mortality of 342 male employees assigned to three 
aromatic amine-based dye production areas from 1914 to 1958 at a chemical plant in the 
United States. All study subjects had some period of employment at the plant after 1st 
January, 1940. Expected numbers of deaths  for the period 1940–1975 were based on 
mortality rates for US white males. There we re no deaths from cancer of the bladder and 
other urinary organs [SMR, 0.0; 95% CI, 0–2.46]. In one area of the plant, 117 men 
produced bromindigo and thioindigo with potential exposure to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine 
and other raw materials and intermediates, including ortho -toluidine. No bladder cancer 
deaths occurred in this subcohort. [The expe cted figure was unspecified but estimated to 
be about 0.5.] [The Working Group noted that the interpretation of this study was limited 
by the small size of the popu lation exposed to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, and the 
ascertainment of deaths only.] There was on e death from lymphoma [SMR 0.83] and two 
deaths from leukaemia [SMR 2.22]. 
Stasik et al.  (1985) reported findings from a mo rtality study of 335 male workers 
employed for at least twelve months in the period 1929–1982 in  the production and 
processing of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine at a dyestuffs-manufacturing plant in Saarland, 
Germany. Three other monocyclic amines had been used at the plant, viz N-acetyl- ortho -
toluidine, 6-chloro- ortho -toluidine and ortho -toluidine. Exposure to 4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine was reported to be predominant. No  deaths from bladder cancer were identified 
in the period 1929–1982 [expected figure unspecified but estimated on the basis of  4-CHLORO- ortho -TOLUIDINE 479  
 mortality rates for the Federal Republic of Germany to be about 0.2.] [The Working 
Group noted that the study had inadequate tracing of deaths and description of methods.] Two incident cases of urothelial carcinoma were subsequently identifi ed in two workers 
employed in the 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine production-plant before improvements in 
industrial hygiene were made in 1970. As a result of this disc overy, a cancer-incidence 
study was established (Stasik, 1988) for the 11 6 subjects employed at this plant before 
1970. There was no cancer re gistry for the region in which the plant was located; 
expected numbers were based, therefore, on rates for Hessen, a neig hbouring province of 
the Federal Republic of Germany. A marked  excess of bladder-cancer incidence based on 
eight cases was reported (SIR, 72.7; 95% CI, 31 .4–143.3). No quanti tative measure of 
exposure to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was available, and exposure to other amines was 
also present. Cigarette smoking was not cons idered to be an important confounding 
variable as three of the eight cases were nonsm okers. [The Working Gr oup noted that the 
definition of the subcohort for th e cancer incidence survey was made a posteriori,  the 
observational period was unspecified, and case ascertainment was inadequately described. 
Consequently, some bias in the estimate of excess risk may be present. The excess of 
bladder cancer could not be attributed with any certainty to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine or to 
any one of the other compounds present.] 
Popp et al.  (1992) reported the results of a bl adder-cancer incidence study among 49 
male workers exposed on an irregular basis to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in the synthesis of 
chlordimeform from 1965 to 1986 in a German chemical plant. The period of follow-up 
was stated to be 1950–1990. Expected numbers  were available from incidence rates based 
on cancer registry data from Saarland, Ge rmany. There was a marked excess of bladder 
tumours based on seven observed cases (SIR, 53.8; 95% CI, 21.7 −110.9), all of which 
were found in workers exposed to 4-chloro- ortho- toluidine before 1976, when working 
conditions were improved. Some of these wo rkers were also exposed to the aromatic 
amine 4-chloroaniline (classified as Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC, 
1993)), which was used for a ppreciably shorter periods and in smaller quantities than 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. No bladder tumours were noted among a further group of 
121 individuals exposed only to the final product, chlordimeform. [The Working Group 
noted that the study methods were not full y described, including allocation of person-
years and case ascertainment. Concomitant  exposure to chlordimeform and 
4-chloroaniline could not be excluded as confounders. The Work ing Group considered 
that the excess of bladder cancer reported w as too large to have been due to smoking 
alone.]

 3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
Studies in experimental animals to assess the carcinogenicity of 4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine, when given orally as the hydrochloride salt, were previously reviewed by IARC 
(1978, 1983, 1987, 1990, 2000). Those found to be adequate and/or reported more fully in 
later publications are included in this evaluation. 
3.1 Oral administration 
3.1.1  Mouse 
Groups of 25 male and 25 female Swiss CD-1 mice, 6–8 weeks of age, were fed 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine hydrochloride (97–99% pure) in the diet at dose levels of 0, 750 
or 1500 mg/kg diet (ppm) (males) or 0, 2000 or 4000 mg/kg diet (ppm) (females) for 18 months. Animals were then kept without treatment for three further months and then 
killed. The doses were chosen on the basis of preliminary t ests, the higher being the 
maximum tolerated dose. A parallel control group of 25 untreated mice of each sex was 
used, plus additional controls used for the other compounds tested in the study. Tumour 
incidences of matched and pooled controls we re compared statistically (both separately 
and together) with those of treated groups. Animals that died during the first six months of the study were discarded without necropsy . In male mice, the incidence of vascular 
tumours (haemangiomas and haemangiosarcom as combined, observed mainly in the 
spleen and in the subcutaneous or subperitoneal adipose tissue) was 0/14, 5/99 (5%), 12/20 (60%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) and 13/20 (65%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) 
in concurrent controls, pooled  controls, low-dose and high-d ose groups, respectively. In 
female mice, the incidence of vascular tumours (haemangiomas and haemangiosarcomas 
combined) was 0/15, 9/102 (9%), 18/19 (95%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) and 12/16 
(75%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) in concurre nt controls, pooled controls, low-dose and 
high-dose groups, respectively [the se parate incidences for haemangiomas and 
haemangiosarcomas were no t reported] (Weisburger et al. , 1978). 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F
1 mice, six weeks of age, were given 4-
chloro- ortho -toluidine hydrochloride (purity > 99%) in the diet at concentrations of 3750 
or 15 000 ppm (males) and 1250 or 5000 pp m (females) for 99 weeks, except high-dose 
females, which had all died by 92 weeks. Concurrent controls consisted of 20 male and 
20 female untreated mice. Mean body weights of all treated groups were lower than those of the corresponding controls and were dose -related. Mortality was dose-related for both 
males and females ( P < 0.001, Tarone test for dose- related trend). The incidence of 
haemangiosarcomas (origi nating in the adipose tissue adjacent to the genital organs) was 
0/20, 3/50 (6%) and 37/50 (74%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) in control, low- and high-
dose group males, respectively, and 0/18, 40/49 (82%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) and 
39/50 (78%) ( P < 0.025, Fisher exact test) in contro l, low- and high-dose group females, 
respectively (National Cancer Institute, 1979).  4-CHLORO- ortho -TOLUIDINE 481  
 3.1.2  Rat 
Groups of 25 male Sprague-Dawley CD rats, 6–8 weeks of age, were treated with 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine hydrochloride (97–99% pure) in the diet at dose levels of 2000 
or 4000 ppm for three months and then, due to toxicity, lowered to levels of 500 or 1000 ppm for a further 15 months. Animals were  kept without treatment for an additional 
six months and then killed. The doses were c hosen on the basis of preliminary tests, the 
higher dose being the maximum tolerated dose. A concurrent control group of 25 untreated male rats was used, plus additional controls used for the other compounds tested 
in the study. Tumour incidences of matched and pooled controls were compared with 
those of treated groups. Animals that died du ring the first six months of the study were 
discarded without necropsy. There was no treat ment-related increase in the incidence of 
tumours at any site (Weisburger et al. , 1978). [The Working Group noted the non-
standard protocol and the lack of information on survival.] 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female Fischer 344 rats, six weeks of age, were given 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine hydrochloride (purity > 99%) in the diet at concentrations of 
1250 or 5000 ppm for 107 weeks. Concurrent controls consisted of 20 male and 20 female untreated rats. Mean body weight s of the high-dose males and females were 
lower than those of the corresp onding controls. Mortality was no t significantly affected by 
treatment in rats of either sex. At the end of  the study, surviv al in treated groups of males 
was > 75% compared with > 55% in control males, and > 80% in treated females 
compared with > 75% in cont rol females. No tumours occu rred at incidences that could 
be related to the treatment (National Cancer Institute, 1979). 
4. Mechanistic and Other Relevant Data 
4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination 
4.1.1  Humans 
No data were available to the Working Group 
4.1.2  Experimental systems 
4-Chloro- ortho -[14C]toluidine is a major metabolite of the insecticide chlordimeform, 
N'-(4-chloro- ortho -tolyl)- N,N-dimethyl-formamidine. Knowles & Gupta (1970) assessed 
the metabolism of both compounds in Sprague-Dawley rats. Chlordimeform ([
14C]-GalecronR, tolyl methyl-[14C], CIBA Agrochemical Co.) was orally administered to 
rats. Urinary excretion of [14C]-Galecron after 72 hours represented 88% of a 3- μCi 
(specific activity, 1.43 mCi/mm ol) dose, with 7.5% excreted  in faeces. The chloroform-
soluble radioactive material in  urine (recovery not provided ) was separated by means of 
silica-gel TLC and tentatively identified by co -chromatography with authentic standards. 482 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Besides Galecron, the urine contained demethyl-Galecron, N-formyl-4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine, and 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. Three other metabolites were also observed, but 
not identified. The highest levels of radioactive equivalents were observed in liver 
> muscle > fat. In further experiments, [14C]-4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine (sp ecific activity, 
1.43 mCi/mmol) was also orally administered  to Sprague-Dawley rats. Urinary excretion 
accounted for 71% of the 3- μCi dose and faecal excretion was 25% after 72 hours. 
Approximately 50% of the radioactivity in urin e was recovered in the ethyl-acetate extract 
and analysed by TLC as described fo r Galecron above. Besides 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, 
urinary metabolites included 5-chloroanthranilic acid and 4- chloro-2-methy lacetanilide. 
The latter is an N-acetylated metabolite, and its ex cretion never exceeded that of 
5-chloroanthranilic acid. Five unknown metabolites were also indicated by TLC, but not further identified. The high est levels of 4-chloro- ortho -[
14C]toluidine equivalents were 
found in the fat > liver > kidney. The aque ous fraction from the urinary extracts was not 
further analysed. The major pathways propos ed for chlordimeform metabolism in the rat 
are described as follows: N-demethylation forms demethyl-chlordimeform; both the latter 
and chlordimeform are cleaved at the carbon-nitrogen bond to form N-formyl-4-chloro-
ortho -toluidine, which can undergo deformylation to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine; oxidation 
of the methyl group on 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine produces 5-chloroanthranilic acid, while 
oxidation of N-formyl-4-chloro- ortho -toluidine produces N-formyl-5-chloroanthranilic 
acid; the latter can undergo deformyl ation to 5-chloroanthranilic acid. 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine was one of thirteen different monocyclic aromatic amines 
given orally to female Wistar rats and female B6C3F1 mice (0.5 mmol [71 mg]/kg bw) 
(Birner & Neumann, 1988). The haemoglobin binding index (HBI) for 4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine was 11-fold higher (HBI 28) in rats than in mice (HBI 2.5). Twenty-four hours 
after an oral dose of chlordimeform, 0.5 mmol/kg bw, to female Wistar rats, the HBI for 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was 2.5 (Sabbi oni and Neumann, 1990). The latter value is less 
than one tenth of that reported for 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine above in rats. This is because 
chlordimeform must be me tabolized to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine before it can be activated 
to bind Hb. In contrast to other aromatic amines, N-acetylation is not important in the 
metabolism and activation of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. 
In Osborne-Mendel rats that were given 4-chloro- ortho -[methyl -14C]toluidine 
intraperitoneally at a dose of 14 mg/kg bw, the levels of adducts bound to protein (480 pCi), RNA (560 pCi), and D NA (170 pCi) were significantly higher in the liver than 
in 10 other tissues examined (Hill et al. , 1979). In in-vitro studi es with liver microsomes, 
irreversible binding of radioactivity was detected which was dependent upon NADPH and linear with respect to incubation tim e and protein concentration. Binding to 
macromolecules in vitro  was increased in rats pret reated with phenobarbital 
intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 mg/kg bw for two days, implying that cytochrome P450 is involved in the reaction. The major and mi nor microsomal metabolites were identified 
by mass spectrometry as 5-chloro -2-hydroxyaminotoluene and 4,4 ′-dichloro-2,2 ′-
dimethylazobenzene, respectively. The form er product suggested the presence of an 
N-OH intermediate, which is further oxidized to an N-nitroso derivative as indicated by  4-CHLORO- ortho -TOLUIDINE 483  
 the latter product. Consistent with the stud ies described above (Bir ner & Neumann, 1988; 
Sabbioni & Neumann, 1990), these authors propose that the N-OH derivatives of these 
monocyclic aromatic amines are co-oxidized within the red blood cell to nitroso 
metabolites that bind to SH groups in haemoglobin. 
Following oral administration of 25 mg/kg bw 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine to male 
Sprague-Dawley-derived [Tif:RAIf (SPF)] rats and male mice [Tif:MAGf (SPF)], both 
from CIBA-GEIGY, covalent binding to both DNA and protein occurred (Bentley et al. , 
1986a). Three times more radioactivity was s hown to be covalently bound to rat liver 
protein (199 ± 18 pmol/mg) than to mouse-liver protein (62 ± 126 pmol/mg). The results 
with protein binding are consistent with the study mentioned above, which showed that 
the Hb-binding index for 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was 11-fold higher in rats than in mice 
(Birner & Neumann, 1988). However, twice as much liver-DNA binding was detected in 
the mouse study than in the rat study. Two DNA adducts were observed by two-
dimensional TLC on silica-gel plates for both mouse and rat. One adduct was present at six- to 30-fold higher levels in mice than in rats. Furthermore, more radioactivity was 
observed to bind to calf-thymus DNA when 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was activated with 
mouse- vs rat-liver subcellular fractions. The high er levels of DNA-adduct formation of 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in mice may mechanistically explain the greater susceptibility of 
the mouse compared with the rat to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine-induced haemangiosarcoma. 
The ability of chlordimeform and 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine to affect hepatic 
xenobiotic biotransformatio n in male Sprague-Dawley rats was assessed (Leslie et al. , 
1988). Chlordimeform did not affect total CYP content, aniline p-hydroxylase or 
glutathione S-transferase activities, bu t induced ethoxyresorufin- O-deethylase, ethoxy-
coumarin- O-deethylase and epoxide-hydrolase, while decreasing the activities of aldrin 
epoxidase and aminopyrine N-demethylase. These effects were observed after seven 
consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of 50 or 100 mg/kg bw, but not with 1 or 10 mg/kg bw chlordimeform, except for a reduction in aminopyrine N-demethylase, 
which was also seen at 10 mg/kg bw chlordimeform. A similar experiment with 
7 × 100 mg/kg bw 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine increased the CYP content and the activities 
of ethoxyresorufin- O-deethylase, ethoxycoumarin- O-deethylase, glutathione S-transferase 
and epoxide hydrolase. At 10 mg/kg bw, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine also increased the 
activities of ethoxyresorufin- O-deethylase and ethoxycoumarin- O-deethylase. Both 
compounds caused an enhanced activity on certain hydroxylation sites of androstenedione 
and a small decrease in testosterone synthesis.  Increased biotransformation by CYPs is 
likely to involve CYP1A1 and 1A2 (Leslie et al. , 1988). 
The metabolism of chlordimeform ([
14C]-GalecronR, tolyl methyl-[14C], CIBA 
Agrochemical Co.) in animals and plants h as been reviewed. The cumulative percentages 
of the dose excreted in 24-hour  urine were 75% in mongrel dogs, 65% in a lactating goat, 
and 80% for a male goat. The percentage of th e dose excreted in faeces after 72 hours was 
0.6 and 1.8% in dog and goat, respectively. After 24 hours, 25% of radioactive material in 
rat urine partitioned into chloroform, but < 10% was extractable in organic solvents from 
dog and goat urine. The amounts of chlordimeform, referred to as chlorphenamidine, 484 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 expressed as a percentage of organic-soluble ra dioactivity at 24 and 72 hours were 9.9% 
and 2.1% for the rat, 1.3% and 0.2% for the dog, and 0.1% and < 0.1% for the goat. The organic-soluble metabolites in all thr ee species included demethyl-Galecron, N-formyl-4-
chloro- ortho -toluidine, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, N-formyl-5-chloroanthranilic acid, and 
5-chloroanthranilic acid. The c onversion of chlordimeform to N-formyl-5-chloro-
anthranilic acid, and 5-chloroanthranilic aci d was goat > dog > rat. The water-soluble 
radioactivity was further analysed in dog and goat urine. Treatment with β-glucuronidase 
or β-glucuronidase-arylsulfatase yi elded aglycones tentatively identified by means of 
TLC as glucuronide or sulfate conjugates. The biliary excretion was also examined in a 
mongrel dog treated orally with chlordimeform at 0.3 mg/kg bw. After 72 hours, 5% of 
the dose was recovered in bile, with peak con centrations of radioactivity occurring after 
eight hours. Metabolites in bile, present in free and conjugated form, included all those 
mentioned above and several unknown compounds. N-formyl-4-chloro- ortho -toluidine 
was the major metabolite in bile. Rat-liver microsomal metabolism of [
14C]-Galecron 
produced demethyl-Galecron, which was sensitive to SKF 525A, but not to diisopropyl-
fluorophosphate. Microsomes from the abdomens of houseflies, Musca domestica L ., also 
produced demethyl-Galecron. In addition, [14C]-N-formyl-4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was 
converted to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine by a rat-liver soluble fraction, which was inhibited 
by diisopropylfluorophosphate, but not SKF 525A (Knowles, 1970; Knowles & Gupta, 
1970). 
4.2 Genetic and related effects (see Table 4.1 for details and references)  
Data on the genetic and related effects of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine that were available 
up to 1990 and 1993 have been reviewed by IARC (1990) and Jackson et al.  (1993), 
respectively. 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine has been tested in se veral laboratories with a series of 
Salmonella  strains, and the results have been generally negative. There were single 
positive results with strains TA100 and TA98 (with metabolic activation) and with 
TA1535 (without metabolic activation). Muta tion tests (with and without activation) and 
DNA repair assays (without activation only) in Escherichia coli  were negative, while a 
positive response was observed fo r differential toxicity in S. typhimurium , indicating the 
induction of DNA damage. 
Positive results have been obtained in sev eral tests in mammalian systems, including 
induction of DNA strand-breaks in vitro , unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary 
hepatocytes, sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberrations (only in the 
presence of an external metabolizing system) in Chinese hamster cells in vitro , and 
transformation of BALB/c 3T3 mouse cells. The mouse-spot test was also positive. 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine bound to hepatic DNA and RNA in mice and rats in vivo , with a 
greater extent of binding in mice than in rats. In contrast, it gave negative results in both the sister chromatid exchange and chromoso mal aberration assays in human lymphocytes 
in vitro  and in the mouse heritable translocation assay in vivo .  4-CHLORO- ortho -TOLUIDINE 485  
 4.2.1  Macromolecular binding 
Bentley et al.  (1986a) examined the covalent binding of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine to 
macromolecules in rats and mice, and found that the extent of covalent binding of 4-
chloro- ortho -toluidine to hepatic DNA in mice was about twice as high as that in rats. 
This was apparent at all time points, i.e. 6, 12 , 28, and 68 hours after a single oral dose of 
25 mg/kg bw of [14C]-ring-labelled 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. The extent of covalent 
binding to DNA decreased with time after th e application, indi cating that the DNA 
damage was being repaired, the extent and ra te of repair being very similar in both 
species. Binding, assessed 20 hours after application, was prop ortional to the total dose 
given, following repeated daily application of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine for up to five 
consecutive days in both rats and mice.  Two major hydrophobic DNA-adducts were 
formed in both species, one of these adducts  being 6–30-fold more prominent in the 
mouse than in the rat. The nature of the D NA adducts has not been clarified. Also, more 
radioactivity was bound to calf-thymus DNA in vitro  when [14C]-4-chloro- ortho -toluidine 
was activated by mouse-liver subcellular fract ions than when rat-liver fractions were 
used. These findings suggest that mice were mo re efficient than rats at forming reactive 
metabolites from 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. However, there w as more covalent binding of 
this compound with hepatic proteins in rats than in mice. Twenty hours after a single 
application of [14C]-4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, the amount bound to hepatic proteins of rats 
was 199 ± 18 pmol equivalents per mg, which was more than 3 times higher than in mice 
(62 ± 16 pmol equivalents per mg). Th e species differences in the metabolism of 4-
chloro- ortho -toluidine coul d account for the fact that mice were more susceptible to the 
carcinogenic effects of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. 
A similar study conducted by the same group (Bentley et al.,  1986b) reported that at 
all time points after a single administration of [14C]4-chloro- ortho -toluidine the extent of 
binding decreased in the order: protein > RNA > DNA in both  species. In-vitro 
experiments showed that mouse-liver subcellular fractions catalysed the binding of 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine to calf-thymus DNA more r eadily than did ra t-liver fractions. 
Conversely, binding to protein and RNA was more  marked in the rat th an in the mouse. It 
seemed that different patterns of reactive metabolites are formed from 4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine in the two species, such that mi ce produced more DNA-reactive metabolites, 
while rats produced more metabolites with a high affinity for proteins and RNA. 
The high incidence of haemangiosarcom as associated with chronic feeding of 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine suggests that blood-vessel endothelial cel ls are most susceptible 
to the effects of this compound. Binding of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine to DNA isolated 
from non-parenchymal cells in mouse liver was investigated, but no preferential DNA-
binding in these cells was found (Bentley et al. , 1986b). Metabolic activation by 
microsomal fractions and NADPH were essentia l for activation, but inducers of several 
CYP-dependent mono-oxygenases had no dem onstrable effect on the rate of DNA 
binding. Cytosolic enzymes did not alter metabolic activation since the rate of binding to DNA was similar, whether microsomes or S9-sup ernatant were used fo r activation. When  486 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 added, S9-supernatant cofactors for sulfate,  acetate, or glutathion e conjugation did not 
affect the DNA binding. This s uggested that activation involving N-hydroxylation 
followed by sulfate conjugation did not happen in this system. Different reactive 
metabolites may be responsible fo r binding to DNA and proteins. 
Capillary endothelial cells are most  probably the target for 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine-
induced carcinogenesis, but endothelial cells of the aorta (Juchau et al. , 1976) and the 
liver (Baron et al. , 1981) were reported to have ve ry low CYP mono-oxygenase activity. 
This may also be the case for capillary endothe lial cells, but endothelia l cells are generally 
active producers of prostaglandins (Moncada et al. , 1977). The co-oxidation of several 
aromatic amines with arachidonic acid was catalysed by prostaglandin synthase (Zenser et 
al., 1980). Reactive intermediates that bind  to calf-thymus DNA may be formed from 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine by horse-radish pe roxidase in the presence of H 2O2. Therefore, 
the peroxidative activation of 4-chloro- ortho -toludine may be carried out by prostaglandin 
synthase in the capillary endothelial cells (Bentley et al. , 1986b). 
Sabbioni & Neumann (1990) investigated haemoglobin adducts of 4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine released from pesticides. Female Wist ar rats were dosed orally with the pesticide 
chlordimeform—a precursor of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine—up to 1 mmol/kg bw. Blood 
was obtained after 24 hours, and haemoglobin isolated and hydrolysed with 1N NaOH. 
The amines were extracted and quantified by gas chromatography with nitrogen-specific 
or mass-selective detection. The haemoglobin binding index (binding in nmol/mol Hb, 
per dose in nmol/kg) of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was 2.4. This indicated that 4-chloro-
ortho -toluidine was produced from chlordimeform and bound to haemoglobin in rats. 
4.2.2  Cytogenetic effects 
Galloway et al.  (1985) developed a screening protocol for detecting chemically-
induced cytogenetic changes in vitro . This protocol was used to test several chemicals 
including 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine for their ability to induce chromosomal aberrations and 
sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without a rat-
liver metabolic activation system (S 9 mix). The SCE test of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was 
positive under conditions of cell-cycle delay;  the response was stronger without S9 mix 
(Galloway et al. , 1987). Chromosomal aberrations were  not seen without S9 when cells 
when fixed at 19.5 hours, but this may be due to insufficient allowance for cell-cycle delay, since aberrations were observed on SC E slides in the first metaphase (MI) cells at 
later fixation times (26–33 hours). With S9, there was a high frequency of aberrations in 
cells fixed at 19.5 hours (37% aberrant cells; 1.4 aberrations per cell) at the high dose of 400 µg/ml. A high frequency of endoreduplicated mitoses (over 20% of the mitotic cells) 
was noticed in all of the treated cultures (Galloway et al. , 1987).  4-CHLORO- ortho -TOLUIDINE 489  
 4.2.3  Mutagenicity 
Zimmer et al.  (1980) tested the mutagenicity and DNA-damage induction by several 
substituted anilines including 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, and found that this amine caused 
mutations in a dose-dependent manner with the Salmonella /microsome mutagenicity 
assay with tester strain TA100 (but not TA98 ), with metabolic activation by S9 mix. 
When the DNA damage in Chinese hamster lu ng fibroblast (V79) cells was measured by 
alkaline elution as described by Swenberg et al.  (1976), 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine caused a 
slight increase in the elution of DNA from th e filters following a 2-hour exposure and a 
significant increase wh en the incubation time was 4 hours. 
Lang and Adler (1982) studied the mutagenic potential of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in 
the mouse heritable translocation assay. Th e maximal tolerated dose of the compound 
was given daily to male mice, by gavage, for seven consecutive weeks. After mating with 
untreated females, about 1000 F1 male offspring per group including a vehicle-control group and a positive control (tretamine, TEM) group were tested for their reproductive 
performance by use of a sequential decision pr ocedure on litter sizes to select males with 
translocation heterozygosity. Partially sterile, sterile, and non-classifiable F1 males were 
examined cytogenetically by scoring chromosomes for tran slocation multivalents or 
analysing mitotic divisions for marker chromosomes. 4 -Chloro- o-toluidine tested at doses 
that showed toxic effects did not in duce translocation heterozygosity. 
The mutagenic potential of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was further tested with the 
mammalian spot test. Female C57BL/6J mice were mated to T-stock males that had been 
treated by gavage with a maximal tolerated dose of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. Mutation 
induction was monitored in the off-spring by checking the fur of the young mice for 
coloured spots that resulted from expression of  a recessive gene involved in coat-colour 
determination. It was found that 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was mutagenic in the spot test, 
which is in line with in-vitro experiments and with its carcinogenic potential in the mouse. 
However, its precursor chlordimeform and another metabolite of chlordimeform, 
N-formyl-4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, were negative in this assay (Lang, 1984). 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine is a metabolite of chlord imeform, a pesticide. The bacterial 
mutagenicity of chlordimeform, its metabolite 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, and another 
metabolite, 4-chloro- N-formyl- ortho -toluidine, was evaluated (Rashid et al. , 1984). It was 
found that 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine did not cause mutation in strains TA98, TA1537, 
TA1538 and TA100, with or wit hout S9 activation. However, 4 -chloro- ortho -toluidine 
caused a dose-dependent response in tester strain TA1535. At a concentration of 
325 µg/plate the number of revertant coloni es was almost threefold increased over the 
control. At > 400 µg/plate, the number of revertant colonies declined. The same authors 
reported that 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine did not cause mutation in tryptophan-dependent 
E. coli  WP2, with or without activation by rat-liver microsomal enzymes. However, 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was active in in ducing DNA damage in the S. typhimurium  
TA1538/TA1978 and E. coli  multirepair-deficient systems (Rashid et al., 1984). 490 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Hamzah & Eltorkey (1995) studied the mu tagenicity of aromatic amines including 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, ortho -toluidine, 4,4'-methylene dianiline (MDA), 4,4'-
methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) and it s three possible substitutes, ethacure 300, 
cyanacure, and polacure 740M in Salmonella typhimurium  tester strains TA98 and 
TA100. ortho -Toluidine, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, MDA, MOCA and its substitutes 
ethacure 300 and cyanacure showed mutagenic activity, while polacure 740M showed no 
mutagenic activity. All of the mutagens  caused an increase  in ethoxyresorufin 
O-deethylase (EROD) activity, while polacure 740M showed no appreciable increase in 
EROD activity. Thus, there was excellent co rrelation between mutagenicity and EROD 
induction. [The ability of a chemical to indu ce EROD activity has been suggested to bear 
some relationship to its carcinogenic potential.] 
Göggelmann et al.  (1996) studied the genotoxicity of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in 
S. typhimurium , human lymphocytes, and V79 Chinese hamster cells. In the absence of a 
metabolizing system (S9 mix), 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine did not induce mutations in 
S. typhimurium or chromosome aberrations and sist er chromatid exchange in human 
lymphocytes. It also did not induce spindle disturbances in V79 Chinese hamster cells. In 
the presence of S9 mix, 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine induced revertants in S. typhimurium  
strains TA98 and TA100, but it was inactive in producing structural or numerical 
chromosomal changes in mammalian cells. 
Sekihashi et al.  (2002) conducted a comparative i nvestigation of some carcinogenic 
chemicals including 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in multiple organs from mice and rats, using 
the single-cell gel electropho resis (Comet) assay. The speci es difference in genotoxic 
sensitivity was analysed at an equitoxic level but not at an equidose. Groups of four mice 
or rats were treated intraperiton eally or orally with a test chem ical at the highest dose that 
did not cause death or distinct toxic effects.  Mice were treated with 600 mg/kg bw, rats 
with 500 mg/kg bw. The stomach, colon, liver, kidney, bladder, lung, brain, and bone marrow were sampled at 3, 8, and 24 hour s after treatment. Significantly increased DNA 
migration was observed in the liver (both species), kidney (rats only) and bladder, lung 
and brain (mouse only). 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine induced chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid 
exchange in Chinese hamste r ovary cells (Galloway et al. , 1987) and gave conflicting 
results for mutagenicity in S. typhimurium  strain TA1535 (n egative, Haworth et al. , 1983; 
positive, Rashid et al. , 1984) (see Jackson et al. , 1993). 
4.3 Mechanistic considerations 
As a general rule, ortho -alkylsubstitution increases the biological activ ity of aniline, 
as does blocking the para-position relative the amino-group. 
ortho -Toluidine has a higher 
biological activity than aniline, and 4-chloroaniline is al so more active than aniline. It 
could therefore be exp ected that 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine is exceptionally potent among 
the monocyclic aromatic amines. This is not  really the case as far as carcinogenicity in 
rats is concerned. Two cancer bioassays were considered negative (IARC, 2000). In mice,  4-CHLORO- ortho -TOLUIDINE 491  
 however, the typical hemangiosarcoma and hemangioma in spleen developed at doses of 
2000 and 4000 mg/kg diet (ppm), i.e.  considerably lowe r doses than with ortho -toluidine. 
All three of these amines are acutely to xic and produce methaemoglobin and Heinz 
bodies as well as anaemia upon  chronic administration. To xic effects are seen in the 
spleen, liver and kidney, the LD50s in rats being in a range comparable with ortho -
toluidine and 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine (600–1300 mg/kg bw, oral dose), but lower than 4-
chloro-aniline (300–400 mg /kg bw). Excessive binding to  haemoglobin reflects the 
greater toxicity of 4-chloro-aniline. The haemoglobin binding index is over 300, as compared to 4 with ortho -toluidine and 28 with 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. However, it is 
not clear how acute toxicity participates in the carcinogenic process and how to explain 
the difference between the formation of rodent sarcoma and the human bladder tumours. 
Evaluating the available information, the Working Group determined that 4-chloro-
ortho -toluidine has no properties that would elevate it from the group of monocyclic 
aromatic amines. The toxicological profile ra ther supports the idea of a common mode of 
action for the aromatic amines in general an d the monocyclic amines in particular.  
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine and its hydrochloride derivative are not known to occur 
naturally. 4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine is used primarily in the manufacture of organic 
colourants. Traditionally, it has been u sed in the manufacture of the acaricide and 
insecticide chlordimeform. 
Occupational exposures to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine occur predominantly among 
workers involved in its production or use in  the manufacture of organic colorants (dyes 
and pigments) and of chlordimeform. 4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine was detected at levels of 
1700–2100 μg/L in the urine of workers involved in the production of this amine. Other 
occupational exposu res to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine occur among workers in research 
laboratories who use this amine as a bi ological stain or in colorimetry. 
The general population can be exposed to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine as a contaminant 
in certain consumer products. 4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine has been detected at ppm levels in 
field samples of plant-based foods (e.g. bean le aves, grape stems, and berries) and cotton 
plants treated with chlordimeform. Similar levels have been found in finger paints. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
Three small cohort studies of workers exposed to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine were 
available: one among dye production workers in the USA, and two studies of 4-chloro-
ortho -toluidine pro duction workers in Germany. The US  study did not show an excess of 
bladder cancer, but the study was small and had limited power to detect any excess. The 492 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 two German studies showed high relative  risks of bladder cancer. Co-exposure to ortho -
toluidine could not be excluded as the ca use of the excess risk  in the 4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine production workers. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine was tested for carcinogenic ity by oral administration of its 
hydrochloride salt in two experiments in mice and in two experiments in rats. A 
significant increase of hemangiosarcomas or he mangiomas was observed in both sexes of 
two strains of mice that received chroni c dietary administration of 4-chloro- ortho -
toluidine hydrochloride. 4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine hydrochloride, however, was not found 
to be a carcinogen when administered chroni cally in the diet to two strains of rats. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
The toxicokinetics of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine were studied in experimental animals 
by administering the compound itself or the insecticide chlordimeform, which is 
metabolized to 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. 
When 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine was given orally to rats and mice the haemoglobin 
binding index was 11-fold higher in the rat than in the mouse. After intraperitoneal 
administration of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine to rats, the level of adducts bound to protein 
and DNA was higher in the liver than in ten other tissues. 
In studies with liver microsomes isolated  from rats treated with radiolabelled 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine, irreversible binding of radioactive material to macromolecules 
was detected, which was increased in rats pr etreated with phenobarbital. The major and 
minor microsomal metabolites were identified as 5-chloro-2-hydroxy-aminotoluene and 
4,4’-dichloro-2,2’-dimethylazobenzene, resp ectively. The former product suggests the 
presence of an N-OH intermediate, which is further oxidized to an N-nitroso derivative. 
N-Oxidized metabolites of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine bind to protein, RNA and DNA. 
Bacterial mutagenicity tests with 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine gave predominantly negative 
results, but tests with cultured ma mmalian cells gave positive results. In vivo , 4-chloro-
ortho -toluidine binds to hepatic DNA in mice and rats; the damage seems to be repaired 
rapidly and the structure of the adducts has no t been elucidated. The only positive in-vivo 
mutagenicity test reported is a mouse spot test. 
There are no data on toxicokinetics or genetic effects of 4-chloro- ortho -toluidine in 
humans.  4-CHLORO- ortho -TOLUIDINE 493  
 6. Evaluation 
6.1 Cancer in humans

toluidine. 
6.2 Cancer in experimental animals 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of 
4-chloro- ortho -toluidine. 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
4-Chloro- ortho -toluidine is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A) .

–499– OCCUPATIONAL EX POSURES OF HAIRDRESSERS AND 
BARBERS AND PERSONAL USE OF HAIR COLOURANTS 
1. Exposure Data 
1.1 Introduction 
Throughout history and acro ss cultures, women as well as men have felt the need to 
change the natural colour of their skin, lips an d hair, or to restore the colour of greying 
hair. For thousands of years, cosmetic dyes ha ve been a part of all human cultures. The 
use of hair dyes can be traced back at l east 4000 years; evidence from royal Egyptian 
tombs suggests the use of henna for dyeing of hair and fingernails. Henna contains the 
dye Lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), wh ich, in its pure form, is also used as a 
synthetic direct (semi-permanent) hair dye. In the days of the Roman Empire, grey hair 
was darkened by combing it with lead combs dipped in vinegar. Interestingly, it has 
recently been shown that this application produces darkening of  grey hair by deposition of 
lead sulfide nanoparticles (diameter of abou t 5 nm) on the surface of the hair (Walter et 
al., 2006; Nohynek et al. , 2004a). Traditional, lead acetat e-based products  for darkening 
grey hair are still found on the internationa l market, although their importance is minor. 
Today, millions of consumers use a large variety of cosmetic dyes and pigments to 
change the appearance of their skin, lips, nails  or hair. Hair dyeing has become a common 
practice in modern industrialised societie s; the hair-dye indu stry has estimated 
(unpublished data) that between 50 and 80% of women have used hair dyes in the USA, 
Japan and the European Union.  During the last century, synthetic dyes have taken a 
pivotal role in hair colouration. Their ch emistry, use and safety have been reviewed 
(Corbett 1999, 2000; Corbett et al. , 1999; Nohynek et al. , 2004a; Zviak & Millequant 
2005a,b). 
1.2 Composition of modern hair dyes 
Modern hair dyes may be classified into  the following categories: oxidative 
(permanent) dyes, direct (temporary or semi-permanent) dyes, and natural dyes. 
In the frequently used code system introd uced by the European Cosmetic Association 
(COLIPA), hair-dye ingredients are classifie d into classes A, B or C: class A includes 500 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 ingredients of oxidative hair dyes, class B those of semi-permanent hair dyes, and Class C 
those of temporary hair dyes (see ex amples in Tables 1.4, 1.5, 1.6). 
1.2.1  Oxidative (permanent) hair dyes 
(a) Composition 
Oxidative (permanent) hair dyes are the most important group and have a market 
share in the EU or the USA of  approximately 80% (Corbett et al. , 1999). 
Oxidative (permanent) hair dyes consist of two components that are mixed before use 
and generate the dye within the hair by ch emical reactions. Their chemistry and use has 
recently been reviewed (Corbett et al. , 1999; Zviak and Millequant, 2005b). Modern 
oxidative dyes contain several ingredients with different functions (examples in 
507Table 1.1) as follows: 
Primary intermediates : arylamines ( para-phenylenediamine (PPD), para-
toluenediamine (PTD), substituted para-diamines), para-aminophenols ( para-
aminophenol, 4-amino- meta-cresol), 4,5-diaminopyrazole and pyrimidines. Oxidation 
of these substances and their chemical co upling with modifier (coupler) molecules 
result in coloured reaction products. 
Couplers or modifiers : these include meta-substituted aromatic derivatives 
(m-phenylene-diamines, meta -aminophenols, resorcinol),  pyridines and naphthols. 
Couplers determine the final shade by reaction with the oxidized form of primary 
intermediates, followed by further oxidative coupling reactions. Oxidants : hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, sodium percarbonate, perborate. 
Alkalinising agents : ammonia, monoethanolamine or aminomethylpropanol. 
(b) Relative concentration of the components 
The actual colouring mixture is prepared ex temporaneously, before application to the 
hair, by mixing, generally weight by weight, a solution containing the precursors and the 
other components of the formula with a solution containing hydrogen peroxide called developer. Each of these two solutions amounts in  general to 50 g per use, but it is not 
uncommon to use 40 g of a colourant formula mixed with 60 g of developer. With non-
lightening oxidative colouring the amount of developer may be twice the amount of colourant formula. The final mixture applied to the hair amounts to about 100 g but can 
vary according to the amount of hair to be treated. 
Given that it is diluted by the developer, if the original concentration of a precursor 
(base or coupler) is X, its concentration in th e final mixture coming into contact with the 
hair, is, at most X/2. 
In practice, the initial concentration X used lies between 0.006% and 7%. This range 
of concentrations corresponds to a spectrum of shades from very pale blond to black. This  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 501

is how the 20–70 shades of an oxidation-dye formulation are built up. It is worth noting 
that in the market: 
• About 50% of shades contain no more than  0.5% precursors or colourants as a 
whole; 
• About 25% of shades contain between 0. 5% and 0.75% overall precursors or 
colourants; and 
• About 25% of shades contain more than 0.75% of total precursors or colourants, 
with even fewer shades with a concentrat ion reaching or excee ding 3.5% before 
mixing the developer. 
The concentrations mentioned above represent the total content of precursors or 
dyestuffs (sometimes as many as 10) that is necessary to achieve the desired shade. More 
precisely, oxidation-dye products consist of a mixture of two or three bases, four or five  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 503  
 couplers and sometimes one or two direct co lourants (see below) (Zviak & Millequant, 
2005b). 
The shade/colour achieved on the hair depends on the ingredients and their 
concentrations. Given the number of ingredients and the different resulting colour 
tones, a clear correlation of hair-dye shad e with the concentration of the primary 
intermediate and coupler cannot be made . The dye shade, however, permits an 
estimation of the ingredient concentrations: dark hair dyes tend to contain the highest 
concentration of ingredients, whereas li ght (blond) shades tend to contain lower 
concentrations. 
1.2.2  Direct hair dyes 
Direct hair dyes include semi-permanent (resisting several shampooing processes) or 
temporary (resisting one or few shampooing processes) hair dyes. Direct hair dyes 
represent the second category of ec onomically important hair colorants. 
Semi-permanent colouring agents contain low-molecular-weight dye molecules, such 
as nitro-phenylenediamines, nitro-aminopheno ls, and some azo or anthraquinone dyes. 
These dyes may be used on their own in semi-per manent hair dyes or in combination with 
oxidative hair dyes in permanent hair-dye products to improve the tone of the final colour 
on the hair. 
Temporary dyes represent the third class of ha ir colours. Temporary colouring agents 
are relatively large molecules and include azo-, triphenylmethane-, indophenol- or 
indamine-type dyes (Zviak & Millequant, 2005a)  that are less resistant to washing and 
may be rinsed off by a single or a few shampooing processes. Typical formulations of 
semi-permanent hair dye are presented in Table 1.2. 
1.2.3  Natural hair dyes 
The majority of natural dyes use henna (p roduced by extraction of the leaves of a 
North African shrub ( Lawsonia inermis ) or the pure dye ingredient of henna, i.e. Lawsone 
(2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone). Henna has a lo ng history of widespread use as a natural 
hair and body dye; however, a warning was raised against Lawsone by the Scientific 
Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Commission (SCCNFP 
2004). In addition, the repor ted increase in the use of Henna mixed with synthetic dye 
molecules, such as para-phenylenediamine (Black Henna) or other aromatic amines as a 
direct hair dye or body paint is of concern (Onder, 2003; Arranz Sánchez et al. , 2005). 
Other natural dyes include extracts of Cham omile, indigo and various woods, barks or 
flowers (Zviak and Millequant, 2005a). 
Natural dyes extracted from plants are of relatively small but growing economic 
importance.

 1.2.4  Trends in composition over time 
The invention, history and use of oxidative hair dyes and their ingredients has been 
reviewed (Corbett, 1999). The components of  oxidative hair dyes have considerably 
changed since their introduction at the end of the 19th century. In the early phase, aromatic 
amines (primary intermediates, para-diamines, para-aminophenols) were used on their 
own in combination with hydrogen peroxide. During the period up the 1920s it was found 
that primary intermediates ( para-diamines, para-aminophenols) may be combined with 
coupler molecules (resorcinol, meta-diamines, meta-aminophenols) to form coloured end 
products on oxidation. Thus in the early 1 930s, the principal primary intermediates and 
couplers used today were already on the ma rket. From the 1930s up to the 1970s there 
was little innovation in the components of oxidative and direct hair dyes; in the 1960s 
most manufacturers used a basic palette of 10–15 typical dye components; substances 
used in the period between the early 1930s to the 1970s  are shown in Table 1.3.

In the 1970s and 1980s, majo r changes took place in the composition of direct and 
oxidative hair dyes. First, numerous innovative dyes were discovered, and several new direct and oxidative substances were intro duced on the market. Second, in 1975, the 
positive results of mutagenicity tests in Salmonella typhimurium  (Ames test) initiated a 
long-lasting controversy about the genotoxic and/or carcinogenic potential of some hair dyes, when Ames et al.  suggested that nearly 90% of oxidative hair-dye ingredients were 
mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  and might therefore pose a carcinogenic risk to 
consumers (Ames et al. , 1975). 
On the basis of a worldwide survey co ordinated by the EU, US and Japanese 
Cosmetic Associations during late 2007/ear ly 2008, there would currently be 50 506 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 ingredients of oxidative, 43 ingredients of semi-permanent, and 88 ingredients of 
temporary hair dyes on the international mark et (EU, North- and Latin-America, Asia). 
1.3 Production volumes 
The major ingredients in oxidative hair dyes and their approxim ate annual worldwide 
tonnage of use (2005) are shown in Table 1. 4. These data suggest that the bulk of 
substances used in oxidative hair dyes (total worldwide use at 50 to 250 tonnes) consist of 
traditional ingredients, such as resorcinol, para-phenylenediamine, 2,5-diaminotoluene 
and 4-amino-2-hydroxytoluene, para- and meta-aminophenol, 2-methyl-5-hydroxyethyl-
aminophenol and 4-amino- meta -cresol. A few other ingredie nts are used at an annual 
tonnage of 10 to 50 tonnes, whereas most oxidative hair-dye ingredients are used at 
relatively minor amounts at 5 tonnes or less. 
The estimated worldwide annual (2005) use of  semi-permanent hair dyes is shown in 
Table 1.5. These data reveal a to nnage significantly lower than that of oxidative hair dyes 
and reflect their lesser economic importance. With the exception of two nitro-phe nol-type 
semi-permanent dye ingredients (2-amino-6-chloro-4-nitrophenol and 4-hydroxypropyl-
amino-3-nitrophenol), which are used at 5 to 15 tonnes per year, most substances are 
below 5 tonnes, whereas three substa nces are below 0.5 tonnes per year. 
The estimated worldwide annu al (2005) use of temporary hair dyes is shown in 
Table 1.6. The total annual use of most of th ese dyes is < 5 tonnes, except for Acid Violet 
43 and Acid Red 33, which are used at 5 to 10 tonnes per year. 
1.4 Application and formation of hair dyes 
1.4.1  Application of hair dyes 
Oxidative and direct hair dyes are applied to  the hair in aqueous solutions or as a gel 
at a maximal concentration of 2.0 to 3.0% of the primary dye ingredient (dark-shade hair 
dyes) or < 0.05% (light-shade hair dyes) (see paragraph 1.2.1). After a contact time 
varying from a few to approx imately 30 min permitting the hair-dyeing process to take 
place, the dye is rinsed off, and the hair is  shampooed, rinsed, cut and dried. Detailed 
modern hair-dyeing techniques were recently reviewed (Zviak & Millequant, 2005a and 
2005b). 
1.4.2  Reaction products of hair dyes 
Taking into account the standard  volume of 80 mL of commercial hair-dye formulations, 
human external exposure during hair colouring would be in the range of 40 to 2400 mg. 
The frequency of hair-dye use varies between once per month (temporary hair dyes) to once per 6–8 weeks (oxidative hair dyes).

 An analytical methodology based essen tially on HPLC was developed, which 
allowed the study of the kinetics of oxidative hair-dye coupling chemistry under conditions reflecting consumer usage, i.e. colour formation over 30 min (SCCNFP 2004, 
opinion 0941/05; Rastogi et al. , 2006). The methodology was applied to 11 different 
combinations of hair-dye precursors and couplers, and demonstrated that the amount of colour formed increases with tim e, while the amounts of free precursors and couplers 
decrease. Only the expected reaction products – based on the chemis try of the oxidative 
coupling of precursors and couplers – we re formed, and no significant additional 
reactions or unexpected products were de tected. Self-couplin g products (such as 
Bandrowski´s base) or transient intermedia tes were not detected in the hair-dye 
formulations. 
During the dyeing pro cess, the consumer is exposed to the precursor(s), the coupler(s) 
and the expected reaction product(s). The kineti cs of colour formation also revealed that 
the exposure of the consumer to the reactio n product (hair dye) is much less than the 
exposure to the precursor and coupler ove r the whole application time. The total 
concentrations of unreacted precursors and couplers in various experiments were 12–84% 
of the applied dose. The typical concentratio n of reaction products in the formulations 
after 30 min varied from 0.02% to 0.65%. A worst-case scenario fo r the exposure from 
hair dyes in the dyeing process was derived fr om the data: the maximum content of a hair 
dye formed in the formulation 30 min after application was 0.65%. In a 70-ml (= 70-g) 
formulation this equals to 455 mg of hair dye formed. 
1.5 Personal use of hair colourants 
The main route of exposure to hair-dye components during personal use of hair 
colourants is dermal. Several studies have measured dermal and systemic exposure to 
hair-dye components, mainly by use of para-phenylenediamine (PPD) or [
14C]-labelled 
PPD. 
In a study from the USA, seven hair dyes (oxidative and direct) were [14C]-labelled 
and applied onto volunteers (W olfram & Maibach, 1985). Th e extent of scalp penetration 
was slightly higher for direct dyes but in neither case did it exceed 1% of the applied dose. 
In a study on percutaneous absorption of PPD during an actual hair-dyeing procedure, 
urinary levels of PPD metabolites were monitored during 24 or 48 hours after the dye had 
been applied (Goetz et al. , 1988). The fraction of the applied dose found in the urine 24 
hours after application ranged from 0.04% to 0.25%. This study also showed a five- to 
ten-fold decrease in PPD penetration when the scalp was protected with clay before 
applying the dye. 
In a study from Taiwan, China (Wang & Tsai , 2003), five volunteers dyed their own 
hair with various dye products containing different concentrations of PPD (2.2–3.2% or 
1.1–1.6 g). The PPD excretion in the urine after 48 hours was 0.02–0.45% of the total dose. 510 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Eight volunteers (Hueber-Becker et al. , 2004) received an oxidative hair-dye 
application containing [14C]-PPD. The dye remained on the hair and scalp for 30 min. In 
the urine samples collected afterwards, 0.50±0. 24% of the total applied radioactivity was 
recovered. The mean systemic dose was cal culated to be approximately 0.09±0.04mg 
[14C]-PPD-equivalents/kg body weight. In an in-vitro  human skin study, a total of 
2.4±1.6% of the applied radioactivity was absorbed (found in epidermis, dermis and 
receptor fluid), corresponding to an  absorption rate of 10.6±6.7 μgeq/cm2. In the same 
eight volunteers, specific PPD metabolites were  measured: five different metabolites were 
found, mainly N-mono-acetylated and N,N′-diacetylated PPD (Nohynek et al. , 2004b). 
1.5.1  Estimation of the internal dose to the user of hair-dye ingredients 
According to its “Notes of Guidance”, the Scientific Committee for Consumer 
Products (SCCP) assesses hair dyes based on data  of percutaneous absorption, mainly 
from in-vitro studies with human or pig skin. In a typical study, 20 mg of a representative hair-dye formulation per cm
2 is applied onto the skin. Following a 30-min contact time, 
the amount of hair dye in the epidermis ( stratum corneum  excluded), dermis and the 
receptor fluid after 24 hours is determined and summed-up to provide a worst-case value 
for the systemic (internal) dose. Taking  the commercially important hair dye para-
phenylenediamine (PPD) as an example, and using a worst-case scenario for a 60-kg adult 
person, the systemic exposure dose was estimated to be 0.052 mg/kg bw, calculated as follows: 
A maximum concentration of 4.0% of PPD is mixed before use with H
2O2. Thus the 
usage volume of 100 ml contains at maximum 2.0% PPD. Assuming the highest 
penetration (0.00447 mg/cm2) and a typical human body weight (60 kg) and exposed 
scalp area (700 cm2), this would give a systemic exposure dose of 0.00447 mg/cm2 x 
700 cm2/60 kg = 0.052 mg/kg body weight. (source:  SCCP’s “Notes of Guidance” for the 
testing of cosmetic ingredient s and their safety evaluation, 6th revision, adopted by the 
SCCP during the 10th plenary meeting of 9 December 2006). 
1.6 Occupational exposure as a hairdresser and barber 
Occupational exposure studies in hairdressers have mainly focused on airborne 
exposure. Only few studies have measured de rmal and systemic exposure of hairdressers 
to certain chemicals. 
1.6.1  Airborne exposure in hairdressing salons 
In addition to hair dyes, hairdressers can be  exposed to a wide variety of chemicals. 
Studies to measure the airborne occupational exposure of hairdressers are summarized in 
Table 1.7. In these studies, ethanol is genera lly used as a marker for solvent exposure, and 
para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is often u sed as a marker for dye exposure.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 511  
 The exposure to organic solvents is generally highest in the hairdressers’ breathing 
zone during the mixing and application of chemicals to the hair. The exposure time is usually short, varying from tens of seconds (hair sprays) to tens of minutes (permanent 
solutions and dyes) (Leino, 20 01), but these tasks may be repeated many times a day. 
Several studies showed that local exhaust ventilation can significantly reduce airborne exposure (Hollund & Moen, 1998; Leino, 2001),  but also indicated that it is seldom used. 
The exposure of hairdressers to oxidative hair dyes was measured under controlled 
conditions. Three separate phases of  hair dyeing were monitore d: (1) dye preparation/hair 
dyeing, (2) rinsing/shampooing/conditioning, an d (3) cutting/drying/styling, on eighteen 
hair dressers working for six hours with a dark-s hade oxidative hair dye containing 2% of 
[
14C]-para-phenylenediamine (PPD). The detected  PPD-equivalents in personal air 
samples (charcoal cartridges) were higher du ring the hair-dyeing phase than during the 
other phases, and ranged from < 0.25 μg (detection limit) to 0.88 μg with a mean 
exposure time of ~30 min (Hueber-Becker et al. , 2007).

1.6.2  Dermal and systemic exposure 
In a study from Sweden (Lind et al. , 2005) the dermal exposure of 33 hairdressers 
was assessed with a hand-rinse method (Lind et al. , 2004). Samples were taken in the 
hairdressing salons during normal working hours: before the hair-dyeing procedure, after the application of the hair dye, and after cutting of the newly dyed hair. The samples were 
analysed for five different co mpounds used in common commercial hair-dye products in 
Sweden: 1,4-phenylenediamine (PPD), toluen e-2,5-diaminesulphate (TDS), 3-aminophenol 
(MAP), resorcinol (RES), and 2-methyl-reso rcinol (MRE). The r esults are shown in 
Table 1.8. The maximum levels detected after ap plication of hair dyes were: 939 nmol per  514 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

hand for PPD, 244 for MAP, 741 for TDS,  773 for RES and 187 for MRE. Positive 
findings were also reported for samples taken before mixing hair-dye cream with 
oxidizing cream. This exposure may derive from previous hair-dyeing activities on the same day or from background exposure from contaminated surfaces. Hand exposure was 
not significantly lower in hairdressers work ing with gloves compar ed with hairdressers 
not using gloves while dyeing hair. It was noted, however, that gloves were often re-used and could be a source of contamination. 
In a later study, the penetration of PPD, TDS, and RES through protective gloves 
during hairdressing was investigated: when properly used, all the tested gloves gave  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 515  
 considerable protection against permeation of the hair-dye components studied (Lind et 
al., 2007). 
A study among 18 hairdressers in controlled conditions using radioactive PPD (2%) 
in hair dyes measured systemic exposure to PPD (Hueber-Becker et al. , 2007). No 
radioactivity above the limit of detection (< 10 ng PPD eq/ml) was found in blood samples. 
Several urine samples contained no measurable or quantifiable radioactivity. Using the 
detected urinary levels and the urine volu me, the mean urinary excretion across all 
hairdressers during the working-day was calculated to be < 25 ± 5.2 μg [14C]-PPD eq. 
1.7 Regulations and guidelines 
The legislation of cosmetics and the regulation of ingredients in hair-dye formulations 
in the EU and the USA differ . During the 1980s, several putative carcinogenic hair-dye 
substances were banned in the EU, but not in  the USA. Furthermore,  in April 2003 the 
EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Products  (SCCP) started a strategy to ensure the 
safety of hair-dye products. The SCCP foresees banning of all permanent and non-
permanent hair dyes for which industry has not submitted a safety file for the substances 
involved, and of those on which the SCCP has issued a negative opinion. Table 1.9 gives 
the list of ingredients that are currently not pe rmitted in hair-dye prod ucts in the European 
Union. A substantial number of those ba nned substances were of limited commercial 
interest. 
The Japanese regulation of cosmetics is the mo st restrictive. All cosmetic products are 
considered equivalent to drugs and are thus subject to premarket approval by the Ministry

Comprehensive Licensing Standards of Cosm etics by Category (C LS); these ingredients 
must be conform certain defined specificatio ns. Other Asian countries (e.g. Republic of 
Korea and China) have developed regulato ry requirements for hair dyes and their 
ingredients similar to those in Japan (Corbett et al.  1999; Nohynek et al.  2004a). 
In response to occupational safety concerns, i.e. the risk for developing contact 
dermatitis, international hair-dye label wa rnings recommend that hairdressers wear 
protective gloves during the hair dyeing and rinsing processes (W ilkinson and Shaw, 
2005). 516 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

2.1 Occupational exposures of hairdressers and barbers 
2.1.1  Cohort studies  (Table 2.1) [Only studies not included in the previous IARC 
Monograph (Volume 57) are listed in the Table].  
Alderson (1980) followed a sample of 1831  male hairdressers identified at the 1961 
census of England and Wales until 1978. Mortal ity from all cancers was similar to that 
expected (134 obs., 126.1 ex p.), and no specific cancer showed a significant excess: 
oesophagus, 5 obs., 3.4 exp.; lung, 52 and 50.8; bladder, 7 and 5.6; leukaemia, 3 and 2.7. 
Kono et al.  (1983) followed the mortality of a cohort of 7736 registered female 
beauticians from 1948 to 1960 in Fukuoka Prefec ture, Japan, for an average of 22.5 years. 
Among the site-specific cancers examined, only stomach cancer occurred in significant 
excess (61 observed, 45.59 expected; 95% CI, 1. 02–1.72). They found no case of bladder   HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 521

Teta et al.  (1984) examined cancer incidence du ring 1935–1978 in 11 845 female and 
1805 male cosmetologists in Connecticut (U SA) who had held licences for five years or 
more and had begun hairdressing school befo re 1 January 1966. A significant excess of 
lung cancer (standardized incidence ratio [S IR], 1.41) and excesses of brain (SIR, 1.68) 
and ovarian cancer (SIR, 1.34) of borderline significance were observed among women; 
the SIR for bladder cancer was 1.36 (95% CI , 0.74–2.27), on the basis of 14 cases. No 
significant cancer risk was evident for fema le cosmetologists licensed since 1935, even 
for those with 35 years or more of follo w-up, although the SIRs for brain cancer, 
lymphoma and leukaemia were elevated. Female cosmetologists who had entered the profession between 1925 and 1934, however, e xperienced a significant overall increase in 
cancer incidence (SIR, 1.29) and significant excesses of respiratory cancer and cancers of 
the breast, corpus uteri  and ovary. Among the men in the cohort, there was no excess of 
cancers at all sites (77 observed, 73.4 expect ed), but cancers of the brain occurred more 
frequently than expected (4 observed, 1.9 expected). [The Working Group noted that no 
other numbers were given for cancers at specific sites in men.] 
Gubéran et al.  (1985) studied cancer mortality during the period 1942–1982 and 
incidence in the years 1970–80 in a cohort of 703 male and 677 female hairdressers in 
Geneva, Switzerland. Increased mortality from bladder cancer was observed among men 
(10 observed, 3.9 expected; P < 0.01) and women (2 observed, 1.0 expected). The 
corresponding values for incident cases were 11 and 5.3 for men ( P < 0.01) and 2 and 1.5 
for women. Significant ( P < 0.05) excesses of incident cases of cancer of the buccal 
cavity and pharynx (6 observed, 2.5 expected) and of prostate cancer (12 observed, 
6.1 expected) were seen in men in the peri od 1970–80. No case of cancer of the buccal 
cavity and pharynx was seen in women (0.8 exp ected); for neither of these sites, however, 
was there an excess in the longer period covere d by the mortality analysis (1942–1982). A 
nested case–control study of 18 cases of bla dder cancer among men in this cohort 
(10 deceased, six incident cases that occurre d during 1970– 1980 and two incident cases 
that occurred in 1981) showed a non-signifi cantly longer duration of exposure (measured 
from the start of apprenticeship) among those who dressed men’s hair but not among 
those who dressed women’s hair. Enquiries indi cated that the great majority of male 
hairdressers in this study never dyed men’s ha ir. In the period 1900– 1950, application of 
brilliantines to men’s scalps after haircuts w as widespread in Geneva. The authors stated 
that those preparations may have contained co louring agents that are bladder carcinogens, 
such as para-dimethylaminoazobenzene, chrysoidine and auramine, which have been 
found in brilliantines in other countries. They also mentioned that 2–naphthylamine has 
been found as an impurity in Yellow AB and Yellow OB, which have been used in cosmetics. 
In a brief note, Shibata et al.  (1990) reported three deaths from leukaemia 
(3.84 expected) and two from lymphoma (3.01 expected) in a cohort of 8316 male and female barbers surveyed in the period 1976–1987 in the Aichi Prefecture, Japan. 532 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 In a cohort study of 248 046 US male veterans who served during 1917–1940 and 
were interviewed in 1954 or 1957 on smoking habits and occupations, Hrubec et al.  
(1992) analysed the mortality pattern of 740 barbers through 1980. Smoking-adjusted 
relative risks were 1.2 for all cancers (110 deaths; 95% CI, 1.06–1.45), 1.6 for respiratory 
cancers (95% CI, 1.22–2.20), 1.5 for prostate cancer (95% CI, 1.03–2.15) and 2.5 for multiple myeloma (95% CI, 1.08–5.63). No excess was found for bladder cancer 
(3 deaths; OR, 0.7). 
Morton (1995) estimated br east-cancer incidence by compiling all cases first 
diagnosed during the period 1963–1977 among residents of the Portland-Vancouver 
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area by sear ching records of all 24 hospitals (16 of 
which had tumour registries) in the four coun ties. An additional 1.8% of total cases were 
identified through death certif icates. The total number of breast-cancer cases identified 
was 7368. For resident women aged 16–68 the usual occupation was retrieved from 
census data, and mean age-standardized inci dence and mortality rates per 100 000 women 
were computed for each occupational category. The mean annual incidence rate among 
beautician was 125.2/100 000, not significan tly different from that for all women. The 
mortality rate was 55.2/100 000, significantly higher than the rate for all women. 
In a cohort of 563 395 female participants in Cancer Prevention Study II, a 
prospective mortality study enrolling volunteers from all US states interviewed in 1982 
and followed up until 1991, 1780 fatal br east cancers were identified. Among women 
whose main lifetime occupation was beautician, th e rate ratio, adjusted for age and several 
known or potential risk factors, was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.62–1.89), based on 16 cases (Calle et 
al., 1998). 
(a) Scandinavian cohorts 
Several cohort studies were conducted in the Scandinavian countries, often based on 
overlapping populations. Consequently, thei r results are not always independent from 
each other. They have been grouped by country to better understand these 
interdependencies. 
(i) Denmark  
Bladder-cancer incidence was investigated in a cohort of 4874 men and 9497 women 
aged 20–64 years from Denmark, who declar ed “hairdresser” as occupation in the 1970 
census. Follow-up was performed up to 19 80 through record linkage with national 
mortality and migration databases. The obser ved number of cases of bladder cancer was 
obtained through record linkage with the national Danish Cancer Registry, which also 
provided incidence rates to compute the e xpected number of cases. In men, there were 
41 observed cases, as compared with 19.9 7 expected ones (SIR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.51–
2.78). In women, the observed and ex pected numbers of cases were 7 and 3.97, 
respectively, thus giving a SIR of 1.76 (95% CI, 0.71–3.63) (Lynge, 1990-1991). 
As a follow-up of the previous study th e cohort was then upd ated for the period 
1981–1987 and extended to several other cancer sites. During this period, 26 further cases  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 533  
 of bladder cancer occurred among men (SIR, 1.17, 95% CI, 0.77–1.72) and 5 among 
women (SIR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.28–2.04). Thus, for the overall period 1970–1987, the SIRs were 1.58 (95% CI, 1.24–2.01) in men and 1.23  (95% CI, 0.64–2.15) in women. In males 
during 1970–97 there were one case of cancer of  the oral cavity (SIR = 0.37, 95% CI: 
0.01–2.07), one of pharynx cancer (SIR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.01–1.64), 10 of larynx cancer (SIR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.51–1.95), 127 of lung cancer (SIR,,1.20; 95% CI, 1.01–1.43), 12 of 
NHL (SIR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.61 –2.06), 6 of Hodgkin disease (SIR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.73–
4.35), 13 of leukaemia (SIR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.54–1.74) and 520 of all cancers (SIR, 1.12; 
95% CI, 1.02–1.22). In females there were no  cases of cancer of the oral cavity (SIR, 0; 
95% CI, 0.00–2.29), three of pharynx cancer  (SIR, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.42–5.89), one of 
larynx cancer (SIR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.01–2.33) , 31 of lung cancer (SIR, 0.97; 95% CI, 
0.68–1.38), 16 of NHL (SIR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10–3.12), three of Hodgkin disease (SIR, 
0.90; 95% CI, 0.19–2.64), eight of leukaemia (SIR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.40–1.85) and 507 of 
all cancers (SIR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.96–1.15) (Skov & Lynge, 1994). 
(ii) Finland  
In a study not entirely independent of that of Skov et al.  (1990), a cohort of 
3637 female and 168 male hairdressers, born in  or before 1946, who were members of the 
Finnish Hairdressers’ Association between 1970  and 1982, were followed-up for cancer 
incidence through the National Cancer Registry between 1970 and 1987 (Pukkala et al. , 
1992). Expected numbers of  cases were calculated by multiplying the number of person-
years in each age group by the corresponding overall cancer inciden ce in Finland during 
the period of observation. Among women, th ere were 247 cases of cancer, versus 195.0 
expected. Non-significant excesses were seen fo r breast cancer (70 cases, 56.3 expected), 
cervical cancer (11 cases, 7.1 expected), lung  cancer (13 cases, 7.6 expected) and ovarian 
cancer (21 cases, 12.8 expected ). Risks were not elevated for cancers at other sites, 
including the bladder (1 and 2.5), leukaemia (4 and 4.2) and multiple myeloma (1 and 2.4). The risk for all cancers was higher during the period 1970–1975 ( P < 0.05) than 
during 1976–1981 ( P > 0.05) or 1982–1987 ( P > 0.05). Among men,  25 cases of cancer 
were observed (17.9 expected; 95% CI, 0.90–2.06); nonsignificantly elevated risks were found for cancers of the lung and pancr eas, on the basis of seven and three cases, 
respectively. 
The incidence of ovarian cancer was studied in a cohort that included all 892 591 
economically active women in Finland, with oc cupations as reported in the 1970 census, 
who were born between 1906 and 1945. The follow-up period was 1971–1995. The 
National Cancer Registry was used for th e identification of ovarian cancer cases 
(n = 5072). The expected numb ers of cases were standardized by age, time period and 
social status, using rates of the entire cohort  as the standard. The SIR for hairdressers and 
barbers was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0–1.7), based on 57 cases, and that for beauticians was 1.0 
(95% CI, 0.2–2.9), based on three cases (Vasama-Neuvonen et al. , 1999). 534 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 (iii) Sweden  
Pollán and Gustavsson (1999) studied the in cidence of breast cancer in a cohort of 
1 101 669 Swedish women, alive and 25–64 years of age on 1 January 1971, who were 
gainfully employed at the ti me of the 1970 census and had also been present in the 
country during the 1960 census. The follow-up period was 1971–1989. Vital status was ascertained from a population registry, while em igration was not considered. Linkage to 
the Swedish Cancer Environment registry was used to identify breast cancer cases 
(n = 29 284). Information on  occupation was extracted from the 1970 cen sus. For each 
occupation, expected numbers of cases were comp uted by use of age- and period-adjusted 
rates from the whole cohort. Among women employed as hairdressers or beauticians 
(total number not given), there were 284  observed and 258 expected cases of breast 
cancer, yielding a SIR of 1.10 (95% CI, 0.98–1.24). When further adjustment was made 
for area of residence and town size, defined from data extracted from the 1970 census, the 
relative risk (RR) was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.97–1. 23) when the reference was set to all women 
in the cohort, and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.08–1.37) when the reference was set to women in other 
occupations of the same group (services and military work). Among women who reported 
hairdresser or beautician as their occupation  in the 1970 census on ly, there were 85 cases 
of breast cancer, and the RR compared with women in other occupations of the same 
group was 1.09 (0.88–1.35). Among women reporting this occupation in both censuses 
(1960 and 1970), the number of breast cancer s was 199, and the RR was 1.27 (95% CI: 
1.11–1.47). 
Mutanen & Hemminki (2001) studied the incidence of childhood cancer in a cohort 
that comprised all Swedish children born  between 1935 and 1996 with a father 
(2.7 million) or a mother (1.0 million) w ith active occupation in the 1960 census, 
registered in the Swedish Family Cancer  Database. The foll ow-up was performed 
between 1958 and 1996 for the age group 0–14 years. Cancer data were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Expected numbers  of cases were calculated from reference 
incidence rates specific for 5-year age, ar ea and socioeconomic status. The total active 
population was used as the reference population. Among the children of all economically active fathers there were 3376 childhood- cancer cases, eight of  which were among 
hairdressers. Among children with economically active mothers there were 1408 
childhood-cancer cases, 37 of which among ha irdressers. Expected numbers for the whole 
group were not presented. There were four cases of kidney cancer among children of 
male hairdressers, compared with 0.4 expected (SIR, 10.6; 95% CI, 2.9–27.2). Among 
children of female hairdressers, there were 2 and 1.9 observe d and expected cases, 
respectively, for a SI R of 1.0 (0.1–3.7). 
All 1 670 517 women in Sweden who participated in both the 1960 and the 1970 
censuses, who were gainfully employed in 1960 or 1970, were followed-up until 1989 with regards to ovarian cancer incidence, th rough linkage to the Swedish Register of 
Causes of Death. The Swedish Cancer Regist er was used to iden tify 9591 cases of 
ovarian cancer occurring during follow-up. The total numbers of women in the cohort employed as “barbers, beauticians, etc.,” or in haircutting and beauty salons are not given.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 535  
 The relative risk associated with various occupations was calculated by Poisson 
regression, stratified by time categories b ased on the census when employment was 
reported (1960 only, 1970 only, or both).  Adjustment was performed for age. Among 
women who reported being employed as “barbers, beauticians etc.” in 1970 only, there 
were 14 cases of ovarian cancer (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9), there were 36 cases among women reporting it in 1960 only (RR, 0. 87; 95% CI, 0.6–1.2) and 51 cases among women 
reporting it in both censuses (RR, 1.21, 95% CI, 0.9–1.6). Among women who reported 
being employed in haircutting and beauty salons in 1970 only, 1960 only, and in both censuses, there were 12 (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9), 37 (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.6–1.2), and 
52 (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.96–1.7) cases of ova rian cancer, respectively (Shields et al. , 
2002). 
Czene et al.  (2003) studied the incidence of vari ous cancers in a cohort comprising 
38 866 women and 6866 men in Sweden who declared being employed as “hairdressers, 
barbers, beauticians and others” in at least one of the four censuses of 1960, 1970, 1980 
and 1990. Of these, 67% of male and 41% of female hairdressers kept their occupation for 
at least two censuses. The fo llow-up period was 1960–1998. Tumour data were retrieved 
from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Expect ed numbers of cases were computed with 
reference to those who were economically activ e at least during one of the censuses, for 
those who were hairdressers in at least one cen sus, and to those economically active in 
1960 for those who were hairdressers in 1960. Th e rates used were sex-, period (5 years)- 
and age (5 years)-specific. For male hair dressers at any census, direct significant 
associations were found for cancers of the u pper aerodigestive tract (51 cases; SIR, 1.51; 
95% CI, 1.13–1.99), colorectal adenocarci noma (135 cases; SIR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04–
1.47) and lung cancer (141  cases; SIR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1. 13–1.99), and a borderline 
association for bladder cancer (87 cases; SIR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.98–1.51). No significant 
associations were found for ot her cancers of the digestive tract, urinary tract, skin, 
nervous system, thyroid, endocrine glands , connective tissue or for haematopoietic 
neoplasms. Results for male hairdressers at the 1960 census were similar. For female 
hairdressers at any census, direct significant associations were found for cancer of the 
pancreas (68 cases; SIR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03–1 .68), lung cancer (160 cases; SIR, 1.35; 
95% CI, 1.15–1.58), cancer of the cervix (213 cases; SIR, 1. 28; 95% CI, 1.13–1.48), and 
cancer of the skin in situ  (110 cases; SIR, 1.30; 95% CI , 1.07–1.55). No significant 
associations were found for othe r cancers, including in the br east, ovaria, and lung and for 
haematopoietic neoplasms, where the estim ated SIRs were below 1.10 (except for 
multiple lyeloma (MM)). Results for female hairdressers at the 1960  census were largely 
similar, although the associat ions with pancreas cancer (38 cases; SIR, 1.01; 95% CI, 
0.71–1.38) and cervical cancer (97 cases; SIR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.80–1.2 1) were no longer 
evident. 
Using the Swedish Family Cancer Database,  a cohort was formed  of all 1 644 958 
Swedish men economically active at th e 1960 census and all 1 154 091 women 
economically active at the 1970  census. In the cohort there were 4639 male and 16 360 
female hairdressers. Follow-up ended in 2000 . Linkage to the Swedish Cancer Registry 536 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 identified 24 041 bladder, 35 776 lung and 11 627 upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) 
cancers in men, and 3405, 8352 and 1767 in women, respectively. Expected numbers of cases were computed using sex-, age (5 years) -, period (10 years)- and socioeconomic 
status (6 groups)- specific rates from the whole cohort. Among male hairdressers there 
were 144 cases of lung cancer (SIR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.20–1.54) and 92 (SIR, 1.19; 95% CI, 
0.96–1.44) among female hairdressers (Ji & Hemminki, 2005a). A significant increase in 
risk for bladder cancer was found in men (S IR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01 –1.54; 88 cases). The 
authors tried to adjust for the effect of sm oking by dividing the SIR by 35% of the excess 
of lung cancer. The smoking-adjusted SIR was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.88–1.34). Among 
hairdressers in two consecutive censuses (1960  and 1970) there were 62 bladder-cancer 
cases, and the SIR was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.88–1.4 5) before and 1.00 (0.76–1.26) after 
adjustment for smoking. The corresponding values for those who were hairdressers at the 
censuses of 1960, 1970 and 1980 were 1.35 (95% CI, 0.91–1.84) and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.81–
1.60), based on 33 cases. For women, data for bladder cancer were not presented, because 
no significant association was found (Ji et al. , 2005). Among male hairdressers, there 
were 49 UADT cancers (SIR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1. 03–1.81). When subsites were considered, 
the SIR was significantly increased for cancers of the tongue (9 cases; SIR, 2.41; 95% CI, 
1.09–4.25) and larynx (21 cases; SIR, 1. 78; 95% CI, 1.10–2.62). The excess in UADT 
cancers was still significant when analysis was restricted to men who were employed as 
hairdressers in both the 1960 and the 1970 censuses (34 cases; SIR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.01–
1.98), or in all three censuse s of 1960, 1970 and 1980 (16 cases; SIR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.12–
3.04). For female hairdressers the SIR of  UADT cancers was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.02–2.23), 
based on 26 cases. When subsites were considered, the observed numbers were small, and a significant increase was found for cancer of  the pharynx only (n ine cases; SIR, 2.49; 
95% CI, 1.13–4.39) (Ji & Hemminki, 2005a). 
A subsequent cohort study was based on the same data, and had the same design as 
that described above (Ji & Hemminki, 2005b ), and although the number of hairdressers 
was not given, it appears to be the same as mentioned before (4639 male and 16 360 
female hairdressers). In this case, the follow -up was extended to 2002, and the neoplasms 
investigated were leukaemias. In the whole cohort of economically active men in 1960 
there were 11 002 leukaemia cases, and in eco nomically active women in 1970 there were 
4040. No excess was found for all leukaemi as for male (27 cases; SIR, 0.85; 95% CI, 
0.56–1.21) or female (39 cases; SIR, 1.02;  95% CI, 0.73–1.37) ha irdressers. When major 
leukaemia subtypes were considered sepa rately, no excess was seen for CLL, AML, 
CML or PV in either sex. When analysis w as restricted to women who were hairdressers 
in both censuses of 1960 and 1970, the SIR for PV was significantly elevated (7 cases; 
SIR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.40–6.64 ) (Ji & Hemminki, 2005b). 
(iv) More than one Scandinavian country  
Following a report by Lynge and Thygesen (1988) on Danish hairdressers, Skov et al.  
(1990) carried out an analysis of the incide nce of bladder cancer and lung cancer in men  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 537  
 and women employed as hairdressers and beauticians in 1960 in Norway and Sweden and 
as hairdressers and barbers in 19 70 in Denmark and Finland. 
Lynge and Thygesen (1988) found an increased risk for bladder cancer in hairdressers 
in Denmark: the RR was 2.05 for men, on the basis of 41  cases (95% CI, 1.51–2.78), and 
1.76 for women, on the basis of seven cases (95% CI, 0.71–3.63 ). No corresponding 
increase in lung cancer was observed. In Finl and, Norway and Denmark, the expected 
numbers of cancer cases were calculated by mu ltiplying the person-y ears at risk for each 
of the five-year birth cohorts of hairdresser s by the sex-specific in cidence rate for the 
equivalent five-year birth cohort of all people who were economically active at the time 
of the census. In Sweden, the expected  number of cancer cases was calculated by 
multiplying the number of hairdressers in a give n region of Sweden in  each five-year birth 
cohort at the time of the cen sus by the sex-specific estimat ed cancer probability for the 
equivalent five-year birth cohort of all people in the region. National figures were 
obtained by aggregating the observed and the expected numbers across the 27 Swedish 
regions. The pattern of excess bladder-cancer  incidence without a corresponding increase 
in lung-cancer incidence was not found in any of the other Nordic countries (Skov et al. , 
1990). 
In Sweden (Malker et al. , 1987; Skov et al. , 1990), the inciden ce of lung cancer was 
increased in male (98 cases; RR, 1.5; 95% CI , 1.2–1.8) and female (31 cases; 1.6; 1.1–
2.2) hairdressers, and bladder-cancer incide nce was increased in men (54 cases; 1.5; 1.1–
1.9) but not in women (six cases; 0.4; 0.2–1. 0). The authors noted that a national survey 
of smoking in Sweden carried out in 1963 had found that 74% of male barbers and 
beauticians aged 50–69 were regular smokers , compared with 46% of all men aged 50–
69 years. In Norway, the incidences of bla dder cancer and lung cancer were increased in 
hairdressers (RR, 1.4–1.6), but the increase was significant only for lung cancer in men. 
In the data from Finland, no case of bladde r cancer was recorded among male hairdressers 
in the period 1971–80 (expect ed, 0.3), but three cases occurred in women (1.8 expected). 
The incidence of lung cancer was not increased : three observed, 2.0 expected in men and 
two observed, 4.4 expected in women (Skov et al. , 1990). The incidence of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma was examined in Denmark (1970–80) by occupational category by Skov and 
Lynge (1991) using a similar method. No significant excess was observed in female 
hairdressers (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.24–7.15; two cases); no case was recorded among male 
hairdressers. When all groups of hairdressers were included  (self-employed/barber, work 
in beauty shops and hairdresser), the RRs we re 1.3 (0.48–2.83; six cases) for men and 2.0 
(0.81–4.14; seven cases) for women. 
Boffetta et al.  (1994) studied the incidence of ovarian cancer and NHL in a cohort of 
29 279 women from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, aged 20–64 years in 1970, 
who declared being employed as a hairdresser  in the 1970 census questionnaire. They 
were followed-up between 1970 and 1985 (1987 for Denmark). Date of death or 
emigration was obtained through linkage to appropriate population registries; linkage to 
the four national cancer registries identif ied cases of ovarian cancer and NHL in the 
cohort. The observed incidence was compared  with the expected one using national 538 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 5-year age-specific rates in the overall fema le population at the censuses. SIRs were 
calculated as the ratio of observed and expe cted cases, and 95% CIs by use of Byar 
approximation. Overall, 127 ovarian cancer cases were observed in the cohort, compared 
with 107.8 expected (SIR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.98–1.40). The SIRs were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0–
1.9), 1.1 (95% CI, 0.0–1.6) and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8–1.4) for the periods 1971–1975, 1976–1980 and 1981–1985, respectively. The overall SIR for NHL was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.84–
1.66), from 36 observed cases. 
Using the same methods as Boffetta et al. , Andersen et al.  (1999) conducted a 
systematic analysis of cancer risk in 10 298 male and 26 545 female hairdressers from 
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. In men, there was a significant increase for all 
sites combined (SIR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06–1. 18; 1302 cases). Significant increases were 
found for lung cancer (SIR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1. 07–1.37; 249 cases), blad der (SIR, 1.47; 95% 
CI, 1.25–1.73; 147 cases) and skin cancers other than melanoma (SIR, 1.22; 95% CI, 
1.01–1.48; 105 cases). No association was fo und for NHL (SIR = 1.01), multiple 
myeloma (SIR = 1.00) or other haemolymphopoietic malignancies, while the SIR for lip 
cancer was significantly decreased (SIR, 0.34 ; 95% CI, 0.11–0.76; 5 cases). For women, 
the SIR for all sites was 1.05 (95% CI , 1.00–1.09) based on 2178 cases. Significant 
increases were found for cancers of the phary nx (SIR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.18–3.62; 14 
cases), lung (SIR, 1.22; 95% CI , 1.02–1.46; 122 cases), cervix uteri  (SIR, 1.21; 95% CI, 
1.03–1.43) and ovary (SIR, 1. 18; 95% CI, 1.01–1.38 ). No increase in risk was found for 
bladder (SIR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.63–1.23; 37 cases), breast (SIR, 1.05; 0.97–1.13; 643 
cases) or haemolymphopoietic cancers (SIR 1. 06 for NHL, 0.80 for multiple myeloma). 
2.1.2  Case–control studies (Tables 2.2–2.6)   
(a) Bladder cancer  (Table 2.2) [Only studies not included in the previous 
IARC Monograph (Volume 57) are listed in this Table] 
In a case–control study, Glash an and Cartwright (1981) in terviewed all patients with 
bladder cancer presenting in three Yorkshir e (United Kingdom) centres over a 3-year 
period (744 men and 247 women). Controls were 993 men and 345 women without 
malignant disease, age- and sex-matched to cases. Mantel-Haenszel ORs adjusted for age, 
sex and year of diagnosis were computed; the OR for “hairdressers” was 0.9 (95% CI, 
0.3–3.2). 
Schoenberg et al.  (1984) conducted a population -based case–control study in 1978–
79 in New Jersey, USA, on 706 white male patients aged 21–84 years with newly 
diagnosed, histologically confirmed cancer of the bladder or papilloma not specified as 
benign, and 1392 controls select ed with random-digit dialling (<65 yrs) or from Medicare 
lists (age 65–84). Participation rates were 89.7% for cases, 86.6% for controls. Twenty 
cases and 38 controls were excluded from th e analysis because of incomplete or 
unreliable interview. ORs were estimated by multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age, smoking and 19 employment categori es. Twelve cases and 17 controls were ever 
employed as barbers or hairdressers, and th e corresponding OR was 1.27 (0.59–2.73).  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 539

  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 545  
 Kunze et al.  (1992) conducted a hospital-based case–c ontrol study in northern Germany 
(1977–1984), including 531 male patients with an epithelial neoplasm of the lower urinary tract and an equal number of controls admitted to urological wards with benign 
urological diseases (64% with pr ostatitis or prostatic hypert hropy) individually matched 
by age to cases. Two percent of the cases re fused to participate. The smoking-adjusted 
conditional OR for having ever worked as a hairdresser was 1.7 (95% CI, 0.6–4.5), based 
on 10 exposed cases and six exposed controls. 
Cordier et al.  (1993) conducted a hospital-based case–control study in seven French 
hospitals between 1984 and 1987. Cases were  765 patients (658 men and 107 women) 
below age 80 years, with a histologically confirmed bladder cancer diagnosed after 
1 January 1982 (527 (69%) were interviewed less than one year after diagnosis) and no previous history of cancer. Controls were patients with no history of cancer admitted to 
the same hospitals for causes other than cancer, respiratory disease or symptoms 
suggestive of bladder cancer, in dividually matched to cases by sex, age, ethnic origin and 
place of residence. Participation rates we re not given. ORs were estimated by 
unconditional logistic regressi on including the matching variables and smoking. For 
subjects who had worked at least six months  as hairdressers (five cases and two controls) 
the OR was 2.21 (95% CI, 0.41–11.94). 
Bolm-Audorff et al.  (1993) conducted a hospital based case–control study on 
239 male and 61 female histologically co nfirmed cases of lower urinary tract cancers 
(90% of the bladder) identified in four clinics in two areas of Germany between 1989 and 
1992, and an equal number of controls admitted to the same clinics for non-malignant 
diseases of the urinary tract, individually matched to cases by sex, age and residence. 
Response rate was 93% for cases and 98% for controls. Among men, five cases and three 
controls were employed as hairdressers, and the smoking-adjusted OR was 4.05 (95% CI, 
0.63–26.09). Among women, two cases and no co ntrols were exposed. The OR for both 
sexes combined was 6.48 (95% CI, 1.15–36.51). 
Teschke et al.  (1997) conducted a p opulation-based case–cont rol study in British 
Columbia, Canada, between 1990 and 1992 , including 105 cases of bladder cancer 
(88 men and 17 women) and 48 cases of cancer of the nasal cavity or sinus (33 men and 
15 women), all histologically confirmed. Controls were 128 men and 31 women 
randomly selected in age and sex strata from the provincial voters list. Since recruitment 
of bladder-cancer cases was restricted to t hose born after 1915, only 112 male and 
27 female controls were used for this ca ncer. Participation rates were 89% for nasal 
cancer, 88% for bladder cancer, and 81% for controls, and next-of-kin interviews were conducted for 15%, 18% and 14%, respectivel y. ORs were adjusted for sex, age and 
smoking. Three bladder-cancer cases and one cont rol had ever worked as a hairdresser or 
barber; the OR was 3.2 (95% CI, 0.2–176).  When the more recent 20 years were 
removed, two cases and one control were expo sed (OR 2.6; 95% CI, 0.1–159). One nasal 
cancer case and one control were e xposed (OR 2.5; 95% CI, 0–225). 
Sorahan et al.  (1998), in a popula tion-based case–control study from the West 
Midland Region, United Kingdom, interviewe d 1427 cases (1106 males and 321 women) 546 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 born in 1915–70 and diagnosed with a primary urothelial tumour between 1991 and 1993. 
A first set of controls was selected by aski ng general practitioners (GP) of the cases to 
each select three patients matched on sex and year of birth. Of the 908 GPs contacted, 
55% accepted to participate, representing a total of 615 cases. Out of 1845 potential 
controls, identified 1147 (62%) filled in the questionnaire. A further set of 1768 potential controls matched to cases on age, sex and GP  were selected through  the Family Health 
Service Authorities, 1052 (60%) of whom returned the questionnaire. [Note: sex 
distribution of contro ls not given]. The primary analys is was performed on the 803 cases 
(624 men and 179 women) for which at least one matched control was available, and 
2135 controls correctly matched to cases. A further analyses was conducted on all 
1427 cases and 2199 controls. The conditional OR adjusted  for smoking and for ever 
having been employed as a hairdresser in the primary analysis was 1.70 (95% CI, 0.74–
3.89), based on 11 cases and 18  controls. When all cases and controls were considered, 
there were 22 exposed cases and 19 exposed cont rols, and the OR adju sted for age, year 
of birth and smoking was 1.63 (95% CI, 0.86–3.12). 
Data from 11 case–control studies on bla dder cancer conducted between 1976 and 
1996 were combined, and results were pu blished separately for women (’t Mannetje et 
al., 1999) and men (Kogevinas et al. , 2003). Subjects outside the age range 30–79 years 
and prevalent cases were excluded. Among women, 700 cases of bladder cancer and 
2425 controls (761 hospital and 1664 population controls ) were included. Eleven cases 
and 56 controls had worked as hairdresser, barb er, or beautician, and the OR adjusted for 
age, smoking, study centre and centre-age interaction was 0.8 (95% CI, 04.–1.7), 
compared with those never employed as a hairdresser. Among men, 3346 cases and 6840 controls were used for the analyses, of whom 37 and 62 , respectively, had ever been 
employed as a hairdresser. Compared with men never employed in eight previously 
defined high-risk occupations (including hairdressers), the OR adjusted for age, smoking 
and study centre of those ever employed as a hairdresser was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.70–1.70) 
(’t Mannetje et al. , 1999; Kogevinas et al. , 2003). 
Gago-Dominguez et al.  (2001a) conducted a populati on-based case–control study in 
Los Angeles, California, USA, which involved 1514 (72%) non-Asian patients aged 25–
64 years with incident histologically confirmed bladder cancer diagnosed between 1987 
and 1996, identified th rough the SEER cancer registry of Los Angeles County. For each 
case a neighbourhood control was matched on  sex, date of birth, ethnicity and 
neighbourhood of residence (69% were the first eligible contro l) [Sex distribution of cases 
and controls was not given]. Twenty cases and 13 controls were employed as hairdressers 
or barbers for at least one year, and the smok ing-adjusted OR was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7–3.2). 
The OR was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2–1. 6) for those employed for l ess than 10 years, based on 
six cases and 10 controls, and 5. 1 (95% CI, 1.3–19.2) for thos e employed for 10 or more 
years, based on 14 cases and three controls. 
Zheng and colleagues (2002) conducted a population-based case–control study on 
1452 histologically confir med incident bladder-cancer cases (1135 men and 317 women) 
aged 40–85 years identi fied by the State Health Registry of Iowa, US, between 1986 and  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 547  
 1989, and 2434 (1601 men and 833 women) population controls, frequency-matched by 
sex and age to cases of cancers at several orga n sites. Participation rate was 85% for cases 
and 80–82% for controls. For 156 cases, proxy interviews were conducted. Among men, 
five cases and three controls were exposed for at  least five years in barber shops, giving 
an OR (adjusted for age, smoking, family history of bladder cancer) of 1.8 (95% CI, 0.4–8.0). All exposed subjects had worked for 10 or more years in barber shops. No data were 
presented for women. 
Gaertner et al.  (2004) conducted a population -based case–control study in seven 
Canadian provinces, including 535 male and 352 female patients aged 20–74 years with 
incident, histologically confirmed bladder cancer between 1994 and 1997, identified 
through cancer registries. Controls were 1430 men and 1417 women randomly selected either by random-digit dialling  (two provinces) or from the provincial health insurance 
database (five provinces) in 1996. Participat ion rates were 58% for male cases, 61% for 
female cases, 59% for male controls and 65% fo r female controls. ORs were computed by 
means of unconditional logistic  regression models and adjusted for age, province, race, 
smoking, consumption of fruit, fried food and coffee, and employment in potentially 
hazardous occupations (as printers, rubber work ers, metal workers, truck drivers, painters, 
dry cleaners, mechanics and mach inists). Occupations held for at least one year full-time 
equivalent were considered relevant. Among men, eight cases and six controls had 
worked as hairdressers (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1. 09–10.8): one case and no controls for less 
than five years, four cases and two controls for 5–15 years (OR 4.7;  95% CI, 0.79–27.9) 
and three cases and four controls for over 15 years (OR 1.98; 95% CI, 0.4–9.7;  P for 
trend, 0.24). Among women there were six cases and 34 controls exposed (OR 0.75; 95% 
CI, 0.28–2.01). 
Dryson et al.  (2008) interviewed 213 out of all incident cases of bladder cancer aged 
25–70, reported to the New Zealand Cancer Registry in 2003–2004 (64%; 165 men and 48 women), together with 471 population controls (48% of eligible controls; 221 men and 
250 women) in a population-based case–control  study. ORs were adjusted for age, sex, 
ethnicity and smoking. Six cases and three contro ls had worked as a hairdresser for more 
than one year; the OR was 9.15 (95% CI, 1.60–52.22). Among men, two cases and no 
controls were exposed, and among women fo ur cases and three controls (OR 9.95; 95% 
CI, 1.37–72.21). Similarly, fo r the industrial classificatio n “hairdressing and beauty 
salon” the OR was 5.35 (95% CI, 1.37–20. 9), based on seven cases and five controls, 
three and none respectively among males, and four and five among women (OR, 4.79; 
95% CI, 0.90–25.32). No consistent pattern by duration of employment was seen, but 
numbers were small. For hairdressers, the OR  was 2.87 (95% CI, 0.59–13.89) in ever-
smokers and 9.66 (95% CI, 0.62–151.42) in non-smokers. 
A mailed questionnaire was sent to 332 male  subjects with histologically ascertained 
bladder cancer, and as controls 566 with pr ostate cancer, who requested an after-care 
treatment in Bochum, Germany between 1992 and 1995. Of these, 63% of bladder and 
72% of prostate cancer cases responded. Afte r further exclusion of 53 bladder and 
69 prostate cancer cases because they either were not resident in North-Rhine Westphalia, 548 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 had both bladder and prostate cancer, were first diagnosed before 1988 or did not specify 
first diagnosis, had asked for aftercare for another disease, or did not complete the questionnaire, 156 bladder and 336 prostate cancer cases were av ailable for analysis. Four 
bladder and two prostate cancer cases had work ed as a hairdresser for more than one year, 
and the corresponding age- and smoking-adjusted OR was 4.90 (95% CI, 0.85–28.39) (Golka et al. , 2008). 
(b) Childhood cancers  (Table 2.3) 
The association between parental occupation and the risk for neuroblastoma was 
evaluated in a population-b ased case–control study conducted  in 139 hospitals in the 
United States and Canada from 1992 to 1996.  Of 741 eligible cases, information was 
obtained for 538 (73%) case mothers and 472  (64%) case fathers (directly for 405 and 
from the mother for 67). Cont rols were selected by random -digit dialling (RDD), and 
individually matched to cases on date of birth. The response rate for the RDD screening 
phase was 74%. Of 708 eligible controls, information was obtained for 504 (71%) 
mothers and 446 (64%) fathers (directly for 304 and from the mother for 142). 
Conditional logistic regression was used to obtai n the OR adjusted for age, mother’s age, 
race and education, and household income in birth year. Expos ed subjects were defined as 
those who had worked as a barber or hairdr esser for at least six months. Two case fathers 
and one control father had worked as a barb er or hairdresser; the OR was 3.3 (95% CI, 
0.2–45.7). There were 24 expo sed case mothers and 10 control mothers, giving an OR of 
2.8 (95% CI, 1.2–6.3) (Olshan et al., 1999). 
(c) Breast cancer  (Table 2.4) 
Band et al.  (2000) conducted a population-based  case–control study on occupational 
risk factors and breast-cancer risk by menopa usal status in British Columbia, Canada. 
Cases were women below age 75 years with Canadian citizenship, residing in British 
Columbia, English-speaking and without pr evious history of br east cancer, diagnosed 
with histologically-confirmed breast cancer  between June 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989, 
identified through the British Columbia Cancer Registry. Controls were women randomly 
selected from the 1989 British Columbia Provincial Voters List, matched to the cases by 
5-year age group, with no diagnosis of  breast cancer before. For breast-cancer cases, 
permission from the physician was reque sted before contacting the patient. A 
questionnaire eliciting information on lifetime job descriptions, occupation and industry titles, duration and period of work was mailed to cases and controls. The questionnaire 
collected information also on socio-demographic, anthropometric, menstrual and 
reproductive factors, smoking and drinking habits, exogenous estrogen use and family history of breast cancer. If the questionnaire was incomplete, subjects were contacted by 
telephone to collect missing data. Of 1489 e ligible breast-cancer cases identified, 
1018 (68.4%) returned a comple ted questionnaire (for 58 cases the physician did not grant   HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 549

up). Of 1502 women selected as controls, 359 refused to participate, 10 were deceased, 108 were lost to follow-up and 1025 (68.2%) returned the questionnaire. After further 
exclusion of cases and controls with no matc hes or with missing information, 995 cases 
(297 pre-menopausal and 690 post-menopausal) and 1020 controls (332 pre-menopausal and 675 post-menopausal) were available for th e analysis. Conditional logistic regression 
models were used to estimate ORs and 90% CI s for occupational variables. At first, 
potential confounders to be in cluded in the model were select ed from several factors by 
keeping the ones significantly associated with breast-cancer risk in a forward selection 
procedure. Then the ORs for each occupation and i ndustry type for whic h at least three 
cases were exposed were estimated in turn, fo r all women and separately for pre- and 
post-menopausal women. Usual occupation/industry (job held for the longest period) and 
ever occupation/indust ry (job ever held) were investig ated. Overall, 22 breast-cancer 
cases reported to have ever work ed as a barber or hairdresser, fo r an OR of 1.92 (90% CI, 
1.04–3.56) and 12 cases reported barber/hairdr esser as their usual occupation, for an OR 
of 1.02 (90% CI, 0.53–2.11). Among pre-menopausal women, 14 cases had ever been a 
barber or hairdresser (OR, 5.45; 90% CI, 1.85–16.09) and 7 cases reported barber or 
hairdresser as their usual occupa tion (OR, 2.71; 90% CI, 0.84– 8.74). In post-menopause, 
there were eight cases who had ever been a barber/hairdresser (OR,  0.84; 90% CI, 0.35–
2.01) and five cases whose usual occupation  was barber/hairdresser (OR not given). 
Habel et al.  (1995) conducted a population-base d case–control study of breast cancer 
in King County, Washington, USA. Cases were 537 white women aged 50–64 years, 
resident in King County, who were diagnosed with histologically confirmed first primary invasive or in situ  carcinoma of the breast between Janua ry 1988 and June 1990. Controls 
were 492 women selected by random-digit dialling, stratified by age, without history of 
breast cancer. Participation rate was 81%  for cases and 73% for controls. ORs were 
computed by means of logistic regression models  and adjusted for age,  education, parity, 
body-mass index, and alcohol. The three longe st-held occupations we re recorded for each 
woman. Seven cases and five cont rols reported having worked as a cosmetologist, and the 
OR was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.5–4.8). For all exposed women exposure began at least 10 years 
before diagnosis, while four cases and five cont rols had had the occupation for at least 
5 years (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.2–3.4). 
(d) Cancers of the haemolymphopoietic system (Table 2.5)  
Herrinton et al.  (1994) conducted a populati on-based case–control study on 
681 patients (321 women and 360 men) with incident multiple myeloma diagnosed from 1977 to 1981, identified thro ugh cancer registries in four geographical areas in the USA 
(Seattle, Utah, Detroit, Atlanta), and 1679 p opulation controls (746 women and 933 men) 
frequency-matched to cases on sex, age and r ace. Participation rate was 89% for cases and 
83% for controls. Proxy interviews were condu cted for 36% of cases and 1% of controls. 
ORs were adjusted for age, sex, race, st udy centre and education. Among women, 
12 cases and 22 controls had been employed as a hairdresser for six months or more, and 552 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 the OR was 1.3 (95% CI, 0.60–2.7). Of these,  four cases and 15 controls were employed 
for longer than five years (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.21–2.0) . Only one male case and two 
male controls had worked as a hairdresser, yielding an OR of 1.5 (95% CI, 0.12–17). 
Results were similar when the analysis w as restricted to self-responders (OR 1.1 for 
women and 2.2 for men ever employed as a hairdresser). Mele et al.  (1994) carried out a hospital based case–control study on leukaemia and pre-
leukaemia in three hospitals located in Ro me, Bologna and Pavia, Italy, between 1986 
and 1990. Cases were 15 years or older, an d included 252 patients with acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) (129 men and 123 women), 100 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(ALL) (48 men and 52 women), 111 with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts 
(72 men and 111 women) and 156 with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) (97 men and 59 women). Controls were 1161 patients (399 men and 762 women) 
identified in outpatient departments on their first visit. ORs were adjusted for sex, age, 
education, residence and selected occupations. Among female controls, 1.6% had worked as a hairdresser. The percentage among female  cases were: 0.8% (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1–
6.8) for AML, 1.9% (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.1–8.0) for ALL, 2.6% (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 0.3–
45.3) for refractory anaemia with excess of blast s, and 4.1% (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.3–26.1). 
A population-based case–control study on haemolymphopoietic neoplasms was 
conducted in 12 areas of Italy. Included we re all newly diagnosed cases that occurred 
between 1991 and 1993 among residents, aged 20–74 years, identified through periodic survey of the relevant hospital department s in the study areas and in regional cancer 
institutes or university-affiliated haematol ogy departments. Controls were random 
samples of the general population resident in th e study areas, stratified by sex and age. Of 
3357 eligible cases and 2 391 eligible controls, an interv iew was obtained for 2737 (82%; 
1520 men, 1217 women) cases and 1779 ( 74%; 918 men and 861 women) controls. 
Proxy interviews were conducted for 19% of  cases and 5% of controls. The diagnosis of 
cases was NHL for 811 men and 639 women,  Hodgkin disease (HD) for 193 men and 
172 women, leukaemia for 383 men and 269 women, and multiple myeloma (MM) for 
133 men and 137 women. Mantel-Haenszel ORs adjusted for age were computed. Subjects were considered exposed if they  had worked as “hairdressers, barbers, 
beauticians and related workers” for at least fi ve years, excluding the five years before 
diagnosis. For women, there were nine ex posed cases with NHL/CCL (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 
0.7–7.1), five exposed leukaemia cases (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.7–7.1), three exposed MM 
cases (OR, 11.1; 95% CI, 1.8–67.0) and five  exposed HD cases (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.7–
6.5) (Miligi et al. , 1999; Costantini et al. , 2001). 
Coté et al.  (1993) conducted a study to investigate whether beauticians and 
cosmetologists with AIDS had an increased risk for NHL co mpared with other persons 
with AIDS. Cases were 2153 persons who died between 1987 and 1989 in 23 US states 
and had both AIDS and NHL listed as cause of death. Controls were 8612 subjects 
selected among persons who died of AIDS without NHL listed as a cause of death, 
frequency-matched to cases by sex, age and race. For nine (0.42%) cases and 56 (0.65%) 556 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

(e) Other cancers   
(i) Cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract (Table 2.6) 
Boffetta et al.  (2003) conducted a multicentre po pulation-based case–control study of 
cancer in the larynx and hypopharynx in the early 1980s in six high-incidence areas: 
Calvados in France, the province of Varese and the city of Turin in Italy, the canton of 
Geneva in Switzerland, and the provinces of Zaragoza and Navarra in Spain. All of these 
the areas were covered by cancer registration.  Cases were 1010 men with histologically-
verified incident epidermoid carcinomas of the larynx and hypopharynx (ICD-9 146.4, 
146.5, 148, 149.8 and 161). Participation rate  was around 75% in Spain and Italy, > 90% 
in Geneva and lower in Calvados, where r ecruitment was limited to the main cancer 
hospital. Controls were 2176 men who were a representative sample from the general 
population, selected by use of different so urces in the different areas, frequency-matched 
to the age and sex distribution of controls. Pa rticipation rate for controls was > 75% in 
Spain, Varese and Calvados, 64% in Geneva an d 56% in Turin. The occupational section 
of the questionnaire elicited the list of jobs held for at  least one year since 1945. 
Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs, which were adjusted 
for age, study area, and tobacco and alcoho l use. Thirteen cases and 18 controls had 
worked as a barber or hair dresser, and the estimated OR w as 2.33 (95% CI, 1.00–5.40). 
The ORs were 2.7, 2.2 and 2.2 for duration of employment of 1–10, 11–20 or 21 or more 
years, respectively ( P for trend, 0.09). 
Swanson & Burns (1997) conducted a po pulation-based case–control study in the 
three-county Detroit area, USA between 19 84 and 1991, including 163 (84 men and 
79 women) incident salivary gland cancer cases aged 40–84 years, and 3751 controls (1807 
men and 1944 women) who were population refe rents selected by ra ndom-digit dialling. 
Response rates were 96% and 97%, respectivel y, and proxy interviews were conducted 
for 23% of the cases and 8% of the controls. OR s were estimated with multiple logistic 
regression models, adjusted by age, race and smoking status. Exposed subjects were those 
ever employed as a hairdresser or in a beau ty shop, and were compared with those only 
employed in occupations with little or no ex posure to carcinogens. For men, too few cases 
were exposed to calculate ORs, while for women, seven cases and 56 controls had ever 
worked as a hairdresser (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1– 6.5) and eight women and 61 controls had 
worked in a beauty shop (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4–7.9). 
(ii) Lung 
Two studies reported results on the associati on between occupational exposure to hair 
dyes and lung cancer (Schoenberg et al ., 1987; Jahn et al ., 1999). Both had small 
numbers of exposed cases and exposed contro ls and were considered uninformative.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 557

 2.2 Personal use of hair colourants 
2.2.1  Cohort studies (see Table 2.7 for studies of urinary bladder, breast and 
haematopoietic cancers)  
Hennekens et al.  (1979) carried out a cross-sectio nal postal questionnaire survey in 
1976 on 172 413 married female nurses, ag ed 30–55, in 11 US states, whose names 
appeared in the 1972 register of the Amer ican Nurses’ Associa tion. Of the 120 557 
responders, 38 459 reported some use of pe rmanent hair dyes; of these, 773 had been 
diagnosed as having a cancer. The risk ratio for the association of cancers at all sites 
with hair-dye use (at any time) was 1.10 ( P = 0.02). When 16 cancer sites were examined 
separately, significant associations with perman ent hair-dye use were found for cancer of 
the cervix uteri  (RR, 1.44; P < 0.001) and for cancer of the vagina and vulva (RR, 2.58; 
P = 0.02). These associations weakened but re mained significant after adjustment for 
smoking habits. There was no consistent trend of  cancer risk with in creasing interval from 
first use of hair dyes, although women who had used permanent dyes during 21 years or 
more before the onset of cancer had a signif icant increase in risk for cancers at all sites 
c o m b i n e d  ( R R ,  1 . 3 8  adjusted for smoking; P = 0.02), largely because of an excess of 
breast cancers (RR, 1.48), which, howeve r, was balanced by a decrease of similar 
magnitude 16–20 years before the onset of cancer. Among the other cancer sites 
evaluated, no significant associatio ns were found that were related to personal use of hair 
dyes and lymphoma (RR, 0.59; P = 0.102) or urinary cancer (RR, 0.62; P = 0.296). 
Analyses of cases of cancer th at had occurred only afte r 1972 (the year the study 
population was defined from the nurses’ regist er) and were reported by surviving cases in 
1976 yielded essentially the same results, thus indicating that self-sel ection for the study, 
early retirement and loss from the profession al register were not sources of bias in this 
study. 
Green et al.  (1987) examined hair-dye use in rela tion to breast cance r in a follow-up 
study of a subgroup of the population described above, comprising 118 404 nurses who 
had no cancer in 1976 and were followed up to 1982. No relationship was detected: the rate ratio for ever-use was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.9–1. 2) on the basis of 353 cases, compared with 
505 for never-use. The risk for breast cancer did not increase with frequency or duration 
of use. 
Another prospective cohort study from the Nurse’s Health Study (Grodstein et al. , 
1994) examined the relationship between perm anent hair-dye use a nd risks for incident 
lymphoma, leukaemia, and multiple myelom a. A total of 99 067 women aged 30–
55 years were followed through 1990. After eight years of follow-up, 244 incident 
haematopoietic cancers were identified, including 24 cases  of Hodgkin lymphoma, 144 
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 44 of leukaemia and 32 of multiple myeloma. No positive associations were observed between ever-use of permanent hair dyes and risk for all 
haematopoietic cancers (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7– 1.2) or specific type s, including Hodgkin 
lymphoma (OR, 0.9: 95% CI, 0.4–2.1), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.6), multiple myeloma (OR, 0.4; 95% CI , 0.2–0.9), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia   HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 559

 (RR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3–1.5), and other leukemias (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3–1.9). In the 
absence of information on no n-permanent hair-dye use a nd without repeated assessment 
of exposure in the follow-up period may in troduce misclassification of exposure, but the 
exposure misclassification is more likely to be non-differential and drives the association 
towards the null, because the exposure assessment was done before disease onset. 
Thun et al.  (1994) examined prospectively the re lationship between hair-dye use and 
the development of fatal cancer in 573 369 women. Women who had ever used 
permanent hair dyes showed a reduced risk fo r all fatal cancer combined (RR, 0.9; 95% 
CI, 0.9–1.0) and of urinary system cancers (RR,  0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9), and no increase in 
risk for any type of haematopoietic cancer. Women who had used black hair dyes for 
20 years or more had an increased risk for fatal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR, 4.4; 95% 
CI, 1.3–15.2) and multiple myeloma (RR, 4. 4; 95% CI, 1.1–18.3); however, these results 
are based on a very few exposed cases. No re lationship was found between the use of 
permanent hair dyes and fatal cancers of th e mouth, breast, lung, bladder or cervix. 
Altekruse et al.  (1999) examined cancer deaths linked  to use of permanent hair dye in 
a cohort of 547 586 women in the USA. Expo sure was assessed at the start of the follow-
up period. A small increase in risk for deat h from haematopoietic cancers (RR, 1.1; 95% 
CI, 1.0–1.2) and leukemias was observed in associ ation with more than 20 years of use 
(RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.7). However, patterns by duration of use of dyes and type of 
colour were inconsistent. 
Henley & Thun (2001) analysed the mortality associated with hair-dye use based on a 
sample of 547 571 women from the ACS Ca ncer Prevention Study (CPS II). After 
16 years of follow-up, the death rate from bladder cancer was similar among women who reported ever using permanent hair dye to th at of never-users (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.4) 
and restricted to lifelong nonsmokers (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6–1.4). Among women who 
had used permanent hair dyes, no consistent  increase was seen in either the death rate 
from bladder cancer or the rate ratio  associated with hair-dye use. 
2.2.2  Case–control studies  (see Tables 2.8–2.11)  
The Working Group systematically reviewed  studies dealing with exposures of cases 
of cancer of the urinary bladder and breast (sites that have been studied extensively), 
lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms a nd childhood cancer. No systematic review 
was made of studies of other cancer sites.

Denmark. All patients diagnosed with bladder tumours from 1942 until 1 March 1956 and 
able to be interviewed in 1956–57 were elig ible for inclusion. Of the 428 patients, 369 
(282 men) were interviewed, together with 369 population controls (282 men) selected from the electoral rolls and matched for se x, age, marital status, occupation and 
residence, and interviewed in 1956–59. Later in the study, a question on use of brilliantine  566 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 was added, and this question was answered by  51% of the male and female patients and 
by 93% of male and 80% of fe male controls. The crude OR for brilliantine use, relative to 
those reporting no use, was [1.7] for men (51 exposed patients; 95% CI, 1.1–2.6) and 
[1.1] for women (two exposed patients; 95% CI, 0.2–6.6). 
Jain et al.  (1977) reported (in a letter) data on  hair-dye use among 107 patients with 
bladder cancer and an equal number of sex- and age-matched controls in Canada. All 
male controls had benign pr ostatic hypertrophy, and all fe male controls had stress 
incontinence. The OR for blad der cancer in association with any exposure to hair dyes 
(based on 19 pairs discordant for use of hair dye) was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.41–3.03). [The 
Working Group noted that the choice of controls was unusually limited and may have 
introduced a detection bias.] 
Neutel et al.  (1978) reported (in a letter) data on hair-dye use in a subset of 50 case–
control pairs (matched by sex and 10-year age group) re-interviewed after a previous, 
larger case–control study of bladder cancer in Canada. Use of hair dyes was reported by 
18 cases and 19 controls. Frequent use of ha ir dyes and hairdressing as an occupation, 
however, were said to show protective e ffects (the former being significant, P < 0.01) 
against bladder cancer, although  the numbers on which these statements were based are 
not given in the report. 
In a study that examined bladder cancer  and occupational exposure of hairdressers 
and barbers, Howe et al.  (1980) found that eight male cases (including two of the barbers) 
and no male control had a history of personal use of hair dyes ( P = 0.004, one-tailed test); 
only one of them had used hair dyes for more  than six years before diagnosis of bladder 
cancer. There was no evidence in women of  an increased risk for bladder cancer 
associated with personal use of hair dy es (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.3–1.4 for ever-use vs never-
use). 
Hartge et al.  (1982) examined hair-dye use among participants in the US National 
Bladder Cancer Study in a case–control study of bladder cancer involving 2982 incident 
cases and 5782 controls, of whom 615 cases and 1164 controls had ever dyed their hair. 
The overall ORs for hair-dye users were 1.1 (95% CI, 0.9–1.4) among men and 0.9 (0.8–1.1) among women. ORs by frequency or duration of use ranged for both sexes from 1.0 
to 1.7, with no clear relationship with increasing duration or frequency among people of 
either sex. Use of black hair dye was associ ated with elevated ORs in both men and 
women; the OR was of borderline significan ce for the two sexes combined (OR, 1.4; 95% 
CI, 1.0–1.9; 68 exposed cases). 
Ohno et al.  (1985) conducted a case–control study of 65 female bladder-cancer 
patients in Nagoya, Japan, in the period 1 976–78. Hair-dye use wa s associated with an 
increased RR among those who smoked but not among non-smokers (RR, 1.31; 95% 
CI, 0.64–2.71). There was a positive relationship between smoking and hair-dye use more than once a month (RR, 25; 95% CI, 3.48–179.86); after adjustment for smoking, no 
significant effect of hair dyes remained (R R, 1.7; 95% CI; 0.82–3. 52; 22 exposed cases). 580 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 A matched case–control study was carried out by Claude et al.  (1986) of 340 men and 
91 women with bladder cancer in Lower Saxony, Germany, in the period 1977–82. It was stated that no association with hair-dye us e was found, but details  were not provided. 
Nomura et al.  (1989) carried out a case–control  study among 137 Caucasian and 
124 Japanese cases of cancer of the lower urinary tract in Hawaii (USA) and two 
population-based controls for each case, in the period 1977–86. A w eak, non significant 
association with hair-dye use was found fo r both men and women, but there was no 
positive trend with increasing duration of use. 
Gago-Dominguez et al.  (2001a) studied 897 incident cases of bladder cancer and 
897 matched controls in a po pulation-based case–co ntrol study conducted in Los Angeles 
between 1987 and 1996. In a cigarette-smoki ng-adjusted model based on 82 exposed 
female cases and 56 exposed female controls, exclusive use of permanent hair dyes was 
related to an increased risk for bladder cancer  (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.01–3.3). The longest 
female users of permanent hair dyes (i.e. > 30  years) had a 4-fold increase in the risk for 
bladder cancer. Men exposed to hair dyes were not at an increased risk for bladder cancer, 
although the estimates were based on small numbe rs. Based on a subset of the population, 
Gago-Dominguez et al.  (2001b) found a higher bladder-cancer risk among NAT-2 slow 
acetylators than among fast NAT-2 acetylators (O R, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.01–7.2 and OR, 1.1; 
95% CI, 0.4–2.7, respectively). In an extension of the study, Gago-Dominguez et al.  
(2003) confirmed this association and also found indications of an interaction between CYP1A2 slow metabolizers and permanent hair-d ye use in relation to bladder-cancer risk. 
In a population-based case co ntrol study conduct ed in New Hampsh ire in 1994–1998 
that included 459 incident bladde r cancer cases and 665 controls, Andrew et al.  (2004) 
found no overall indication of an increased bladder-cancer risk among hair-dye users, 
after adjustment for age, smoking and education level. However, women exposed to 
permanent hair dyes who had started their use be fore age 37 were at a 2.3-fold increased 
risk for bladder cancer (95%  CI, 1.1–4.6), based on 22 exposed cases and 32 exposed 
controls. Women with greater frequency of use and prolonged time since first use of 
permanent hair dyes were also at an increased  risk for bladder cancer. Subjects exposed 
for less than 11 years to perm anent dyes had a 1.7-fold excess in risk (95% CI, 0.8–3.7), 
and among those exposed for more than 11 years the risk was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7–3.2, P-
value for linear trend, 0.72). In an ex tension of the New Hampshire study, Kelsey et al.  
(2005) found that among bla dder-cancer cases, hair-dye use was significantly associated 
to TP53 immunohisto-chemistry inactivation (OR,  3.2; 95% CI, 1.4–7.2), but not to 
TP53  mutation (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.4–4.4), based on 282 cases who were never-users of 
hair dyes and 73 cases who had ever used hair dyes. 
In a case–control study conducted in Texas among 712 incident bladder-cancer cases 
and 712 hospital-based controls, Lin et al.  (2006) found no indicat ion of an increased risk 
for bladder cancer among users of permanent ha ir dyes after adjustment for age, sex, race 
and smoking, based on 100 exposed cases a nd 115 exposed controls (OR, 0.81; 95% 
CI, 0.50–1.30). No increased risks were foun d for other types of hair dyes or when  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 581  
 duration variables were assessed. Restriction of  the analyses to women only also showed 
no significant increase in risks. 
In a case–control study conducted in Spain between 1998 and 2001 among 
152 female bladder-cancer cases and 166 female controls, Kogevinas et al.  (2006) found 
no overall or specific indicatio n of an elevated risk for bladder cancer among hair-dye 
users (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5 –1.4), based on 78 exposed cases after adjustment for age, 
region and smoking. No increase in risk was observed for only permanent users for at 
least 10 times (OR,  0.8; 95% CI, 0.5–1.5), am ong users of only dark colour (OR, 1.1; 
95% CI, 0.5–2.5), or for self-applying of the dyes with no gloves (95% CI, 0.2–6.1). 
Users for more than 32 years showed a non- significantly increased risk of 1.2 (95% 
CI, 0.5–2.7). ORs were below 1.0 for high cu mulative exposure. There was no indication 
of an increased risk for bladde r cancer associated with the NAT2  genotype. 
Takkouche et al.  (2005) published a meta-analysis evaluating the association between 
use of hair dyes and risk for cancer. This meta-analysis of 10 studies (9 case–control and 
1 cohort) reached an overall risk estimate for bladder cancer of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.89–1.14). 
The pooled OR for permanent dye use was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.93–1.38) and 1.0 (95% 
CI, 0.82–1.22) for intensive exposure using fixed effects models. For random effects models the estimates were 1.13 (95% CI, 0.93–1.38) and 1.33 (95% CI, 0.69–2.56), 
respectively.  
(b) Breast cancer  (Table 2.9)  
Shafer & Shafer (1976) reported on 100 consecutive breast-cancer patients in a 
clinical practice in New York, USA, 87% of  whom had been long-term users of hair-
colouring agents, and a group of age-comparable controls, 26% of whom were regular users of permanent hair dyes over prolonged periods. [The Working Group noted the 
dissimilarity of the exposure definitions for the two groups and the lack of information on 
the number of controls or the manner of eliciting details on the use of hair dyes.] 
Kinlen et al.  (1977) reported a study of 191 breast- cancer patients interviewed in the 
hospital in 1975 and 1976 in Oxford, United Kingdom, and 561 controls without cancer, 
matched to the patients by age (within thr ee years), marital status and social class. 
Seventy-three cases and 213 cont rols had used permanent or semi-permanent hair dyes, 
giving an OR of 1.01. There was no evidence of  an increasing risk fo r breast cancer with 
increasing duration of use of hair dyes or with use beginning more than four or more than nine years before diagnosis. Stratification by age at first pregnancy showed a deficit of 
cases in which hair-dye use was reported among women whose first pregnancy occurred 
at ages 15–19 (33.3% of cases u sed hair dyes, compared with  64.7% of controls) and an 
excess of cases with use of hair dyes among women whose first pregnancy had occurred 
at 30 years of age or older (38.3% of cases and 25.5% of controls). There were two 
hairdressers among cases (1.0%) and 10 among controls (1.8%). 
Shore et al.  (1979) compared the hair-dye use of 129 breast-cancer patients and 
193 control subjects aged 25 and over, id entified from the records of a multiphasic 
screening clinic in New York City, USA. Adjusted ORs for use of permanent hair dyes  582 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 for 0, 5, 10 and 15 years were, respectively , 1.08, 1.31, 1.58 and 1.44 (none significantly 
different from 1.0). A significant relationship ( P = 0.01) was noted between a measure of 
cumulative hair-dye use (number of years times frequency per year) and breast cancer. 
This relationship also held if the analysis was limited to cases in which the patient herself 
had responded to the telephone interview. Among women who had used hair dyes 10 years before developing breast cancer, the re lationship held only for women at low risk 
(as assessed from the distribution of a multivar iate confounder score) and for those 50–
79 years old. [The Working Group noted that  the use of a multivariate confounder score 
for the control of confounding may produce misleading results.] 
To follow-up on these findings, Koenig et al.  (1991) carried out a case–control study 
of 398 women with breast cancer and 790 controls identified at the same screening centre. For ever-use, the adjusted OR was 0. 8 (95% CI, 0.6–1.1), and there was no trend 
with increased use. 
Stavraky et al.  (1979) compared 50 breast-cancer  cases at a cancer-treatment centre 
with 100 hospitalized controls in London , Ontario, Canada and 35 breast-cancer cases 
with 70 neighbourhood controls in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with respect to hair-dye 
use. The ORs for breast cancer from use of permanent hair dyes (at any time) were 1.3 
(95% CI, 0.6–2.5) in London an d 1.1 (0.5–2.4) in Toronto. Further statistical analyses, 
allowing for smoking habits, family history of cancer and age at first birth, showed no 
significant relationship between hair-d ye use and breast-cancer incidence. 
Nasca et al.  (1980) reported a study of 118 patients with breast cancer and 
233 controls matched to the patients by age and county of residence (115 matched triplets 
and three matched pairs) in upper New York St ate, USA. In the study  overall, there was 
no significant association between breast cancer  and use of permanent or semi-permanent 
dyes (OR, 1.11), nor was an increase in risk  seen with increasing numbers of times hair 
dyes were used or with increasing time sin ce first use. The authors commented that 
women who dyed their hair to change its colour, as distinct from those who dyed their 
hair to mask greyness, had a significantly in creased risk for breast cancer (OR, 3.13; 95% 
CI, 1.50–6.54). In this group,  there was a significant trend towards increasing risk with 
increasing numbers of exposures to hair dyes.  Examination of risk for hair-dye use in 
subgroups of women defined by other risk f actors for breast cancer showed an OR of 4.5 
(95% CI, 1.20–16.78) for women with a past  history of benign br east disease, an OR of 
1.75 ( P = 0.03, one-tailed test) for 12 or more years of schooling, and an OR of 3.33 (95% 
CI, 1.10–10.85) for women aged 40–49 years; the OR was near unity for all other age 
groups. These effects appeared to be independent of one another and were not explained by confounding by past pregnancy, age at first pregnancy, history of artificial menopause 
or age at menarche. The authors stressed that  the associations obser ved in the subgroups 
should be considered as newly generated hypoth eses, requiring further testing. In a larger, 
subsequent study (Nasca et al. , 1990) (reported as an abst ract) of 1617 cases of breast 
cancer in New York State and 1617 controls , these authors found no relationship with 
hair-dye use (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90–1.21), no significant difference in the ORs for 592 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 women with a history of benign breast disease (1.15; 95% CI, 0.86–1.53) and those 
without (0.98; 95% CI , 0.83–1.16) and no association with  duration of hair-dye use. 
Wynder and Goodman (1983) carried out a hospital-based case–control study of 
401 cases of breast cancer in New York City in 1979–1981. No association was found 
with hair-dye use (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78–1.32) and there was no dose–response relationship. 
Cook et al.  (1999) carried out a case–control st udy in Western Washington (USA) 
using the Cancer Surveillan ce System (CSS) to recruit 844 cases of breast cancer 
(747 invasive and 97 in situ ). The 960 controls were frequency-matched to cases by age. 
The aim was to evaluate use of hair colo uring and hair-spray application and breast-
cancer risk among women in their reproductive age. An increased risk was identified for ever-use of hair dyes (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1 .6) adjusted by age, parity, weight and 
history of breast cancer in first-degree relati ves. No relation to breast cancer risk was 
found for hair-spray application. 
In 2002, Petro-Nustas et al.  evaluated exposure to chemi cal hair dyes and the risk for 
breast cancer among Jordanian women. One hundred breast-cancer cases identified 
through the Jordan cancer regi stry and 100 population-base d controls were included, 
matched to age, parity, educa tion level and place of residen ce. A high prevalence in the 
use of chemical hair dyes was observed among cases compared with controls (95% vs 
51%) with an eightfold incr eased risk for breast cancer among users (OR, 8.62; 95% 
CI, 3.33–22.28). Information about frequency, colour, type and years of exposure was not 
available. 
Zheng et al.  in 2002 carried out a case–control study  in Connecticut, USA to evaluate 
personal use of hair dyes and risk for breast  cancer. A total of 608 incident breast-cancer 
cases and 609 population contro ls were included. No incr ease in risk associated with 
personal use of hair dyes was observed (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7–1.2) after adjustment for age, race, study site and age at menopause. Detailed information on duration, frequency, 
type and colour allowed quantitative study of risk; none of the ORs related to these factors 
was statistically significant. 
A meta-analysis by Takkouche et al.  (2005) included  12 case–control and two cohort 
studies, and reached an overall risk estimate fo r breast cancer of 1.04 (95% CI, 0. 98–1.09) 
with use of hair dyes. When restricted to  a population-based fra mework, the analysis 
showed an OR of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.01–1.23). No association with use of permanent dyes 
(OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.94–1.05) or intensity of exposure (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.89–1.11) 
was identified under the assumptions of the fi xed effects model, and no differences in 
estimates were found under the hypothesis of random effects. 
(c) Lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers (Table 2.10)  
In a further report of the study of Stavraky et al.  (1979) in Canada, these authors 
found no significant increase in risk fo r leukaemia or lymphoma (70 cases) (Stavraky et 
al. (1981). [The Working Group noted that it was not possible to distinguish different 
haematopoietic malignancies.]  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 593

  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 607  
  
In a hospital-based case–control  study (101 matched pairs)  of acute non-lymphocytic 
leukaemia in the Baltimore (USA) area, pu blished only as an abstract, Markowitz et al.  
(1985) found a significant positive association  with hair-dye use (OR, 3.1). There was, 
however, no difference between regular use (at least once a year) (OR, 2.7) and less 
frequent use (OR, 2.2). 
Cantor et al.  (1988) carried out a p opulation-based case– control study of hair-dye use 
among 578 men with leukaemia, 622 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 1245 population 
controls in Iowa and Minnesota, USA, in  1980–83. Significantl y increased ORs were 
found for leukaemia (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–2.7) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 2.0; 
1.3–3.0) in association with personal use or other potential exposure to hair tints, any hair 
colouring product or hair dyes. The authors stated that the ORs did not substantially 
change after exclusion of the 10 men with other potential exposure to hair-colouring 
products (e.g., occupational exposure), but detailed results were not presented. [The 
Working Group noted that, although the au thors suggested an increased risk with 
increasing extent of hair-dye use, examination of the paper could not verify this.] 
A population-based case–co ntrol study carried out in ea stern Nebraska, USA, during 
1983–1986 investigated use of hair-colouring products among a total of 201 male and 184 female cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma,  35 male and 35 female cases of Hodgkin 
disease, 32 male and 40 female cases of multip le myeloma, 37 male and 19 female cases 
of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and 725 male  and 707 female residential controls who 
could be interviewed (Zahm et al. , 1992). Telephone interviews were conducted with 
cases, controls or their next of kin; response rates were 81–96% for cases and 84% for 
controls. Among women, use of any hair-c olouring pr oduct was associated with an 
increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (O R, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1– 2.2), Hodgkin disease 
(OR, 1.7; 0.7–4.0) and multiple myeloma (OR, 1.8; 0.9–3.7), and women who used 
permanent hair dyes had high ORs for all three neoplasms (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.8), Hodgkin disease (OR, 3.0, 95% CI, 1. 1–7.9) and multiple 
myeloma (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.1); all P < 0.05). For non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 
multiple myeloma, the risks were highest among women who used dark permanent dyes. Long duration and early age at first use tended to increase the risk among men, use of any 
hair-colouring product was associated with nonsignificantly increased ORs for Hodgkin 
disease (OR, 1.7), and multiple myeloma (OR, 1.8), on the basis of three and four 
exposed cases, respectively;  no increase was found for non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(OR, 0.8). Use of any hair dye was not associ ated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 
either women or men (OR, 1.0). 
A population-based case–control study of 17 3 white men with multiple myeloma and 
650 controls was carried out in Iowa, US A. The risk for multiple myeloma was 
significantly elevated (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1. 0–3.6; 14 exposed cases) among users of hair 
dyes. For men who had used hair dyes for one y ear or more at a frequency or one or more 
times per month, the OR was 4.3 (95% CI , 0.9–19.7; four exposed cases) (Brown et al. , 
1992). 608 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Herrinton et al.  (1994) carried out a case–control study to evaluate the relation 
between both personal exposure to hair dyes and the risk for multiple myeloma (MM) in the USA. Six hundred eighty-nine MM cases and 1681 controls were included. Among 
women, no significant increase in risk was ob served for personal use (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 
0.83–1.5). Results for males were also non-significant and based on small numbers of exposed cases. Informati on about colour and ty pe was not collected. 
Mele et al.  (1995) carried out a case–control study in  Italy to evaluate exposure to hair 
dyes and risk for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). A total of 254 cases and 1161 hospital controls were included. No significant 
associations were found for APL (OR, 1.5; 95 % CI, 0.6–3.7) or AM L (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 
0.5–1.3). No data were available for colour or frequency. 
In 1996, Ido et al.  carried out a case–control st udy in Japan. A total of 
116 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) cases from among hospital members of the 
Idiopathic Disorders Organs Research Co mmittee, and 116 hospital controls were 
included to evaluate exposur e to hair dyes. An increased risk for MDS was observed 
among users of hair-dye products (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 0.90–3.49), although it did not 
reach statistical significan ce. The odds ratio among women was 2.50 (95% CI, 0.97–
6.41). Although information about duration and frequency of hair-dye use was collected, 
no results about these associations were reported. 
Mele et al.  (1996) carried out another case–cont rol study in Italy. Thirty-nine 
thrombocythemia cases and 156 hospital controls we re included to evaluate both personal 
use of hair dye and occupational exposure. The prevalence of hair-dye exposure among 
cases was 38.2%. A non-significantly increased ri sk was reported (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.7–
3.2), although association between  dark hair-dye use and increased risk was statistically 
significant (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.4–19.9) when  the duration of exposure exceeded 10 years. 
Nagata et al.  (1999) evaluated the risk for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 
personal use of hair dyes using a case–control  study carried out in  Japan. A total of 
111 MDS cases and 830 controls randomly sel ected from the same prefecture as the cases 
responded to a health questionn aire. The risk for MDS for ever  having used hair dyes was 
1.99 (95% CI, 1.17–3.38). A statistically si gnificant trend was observed in risk with 
increasing years of exposure and number of hair-dye applications ever used. 
Holly et al.  (1998) carried out a case–control stud y in the San Francisco Bay area 
(USA) to evaluate the association of hair-dye use and the risk for non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL). A total of 713 NHL cases a nd 1604 population co ntrols were asked 
about type, colour, number of years of exposure for each product, age at first and last use, 
and frequency of use. Stratified results by ge nder were reported. No increases in risk were 
found for ever-use of hair dyes (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.77–1.30 for women and OR, 1.3; 
95% CI, 0.86–2.00 for men) or for years of use, lifetime frequency of use, colour or type. 
Miligi et al.  (1999) carried out a case–co ntrol study in Italy to study the role of hair-
dye exposure and occupation as a hairdresser in  the etiology of haematolymphopoietic 
malignancies. A total of 1170 cases (611 NHL, 260 leukaem ia, 165 Hodgkin lymphoma, 
and 134 multiple myeloma) and 828 populat ion controls were enrolled. The overall  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 609  
 estimation of OR for ever-exposure to hair dyes was not reported, but for none of the 
studied diseases was a significant risk observ ed. Among those women who had used dark 
permanent products, an increased in risk w as observed for leukaemia (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 
1.1–3.8). 
In 2001, Björk et al.  conducted a case–control study in Southern Sweden to evaluate 
the risk for Philadelphia chromosome-positive  chronic myeloid leuk aemia associated with 
the regular use of hair dyes. Among the 226 cases included, the prevalence of exposure to 
hair dyes was 11.1%, whereas that among th e 251 population controls was 26.4%. The 
estimated risk for ever-use of hair dyes was less among cases compared with controls 
(OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.18–0.68). Informa tion about dose-response was not provided. 
Schroeder et al.  (2002) carried out a population-based NHL study in Iowa and 
Minnesota (USA) to evaluate non-occupati onal exposures. A total of 622 cases and 
1245 controls were included. The study also  considered the pres ence of the t(14;18) 
translocation in the tumours. An increased risk for NHL with ever-use of hair dyes was 
observed independently of the t(14;18) translocation (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–3.4). An 
excess in risk was observed both among subjects with the t(14;18) tran slocation (OR, 1.8; 
95% CI, 0.9–3.7) and without the translocat ion (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–3.4). A large 
proportion of NHL (> 70%) could not be evaluated in histological subtypes due to lack of 
histological information. 
Pu et al.  (2003) carried out a case–control study (114 cases and 114 controls) on 
haematological cancer and report ed increased risks associated with ever-use of hair dyes 
(OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.59–7.18) and with in creasing frequency of use (OR, 3.28; 95% 
CI, 1.99–7.34). [The Working Group noticed  that the study did not provide enough 
methodological and statistical details to fully evaluate the results; these data are not 
included in Table 2.10]. 
Rauscher et al.  (2004) carried out a population-based acute leukaemia study 
evaluating the risk from ha ir-dye exposure. A total of 769 cases and 623 controls were 
interviewed in the USA and Canada. A slight increase in risk was observed for those ever 
exposed to hair dyes (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.99–1.80). In addition, the use of permanent dye only, for 15 years or more, was associated  with an increased acute leukaemia risk 
(OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.6). The OR was marg inally elevated for use of permanent dyes 
that had started in the 1970s (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.98–3.0). 
Zhang et al.  (2004) carried out a case–control study  in Connecticut, USA to evaluate 
the association between hair dyes and risk for NHL among females. A total of 601 cases 
and 717 population controls were included. Th e OR associated with hair-dye use was 1.1 
(95% CI, 0.9–1.5). Additionally, no evidence of a dose-response with the total number of 
applications, duration of use, years since first use, colour or type was observed. However, 
the OR for permanent dark-colour users for mo re than 25 years was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0–4.0) 
and it was 1.2 (95% CI, 0.6–2.1) if the duratio n of use was less than 15 years. Considering 
lifetime dose, those with more than 200 applications had an OR of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.0–2.8). 
An increase in risk w as observed for those starting use before 1980 (OR, 1.3; 95% 
CI, 1.0–1.8). By NHL subtypes,  a significant increase in risk was seen for follicular 610 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 lymphoma and B-Cell NHL among women who used permanent hair-colouring products 
(OR for follicular lymphoma, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2–3.2; OR for B-cell NHL, 1.6; 95% CI , 1.2–2.3). 
Benavente et al.  (2005) carried out a case–control stud y in Spain to evaluate the risk 
for lymphoma associated with hair-dye exposure. A total of 574 lymphoma cases and 
616 hospital controls were included in the st udy. The prevalence of hair-dye exposure 
was 79% among females and 8% among males.  A non-significant increase in risk was 
observed for ever-use (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9–1.7). No association was observed for colour, type, frequency, or lifetime dose. By specific lymphoma subtypes, a twofold 
increase in risk for ever-use was observed for CL L (95% CI, 1.1–4.7). A significant linear 
trend by years of use was also observed for CLL ( P = 0.04) among those exposed for 10 
years or less (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4–3.0), fr om 11 to 24 years of use (OR, 3.2; 95% 
CI, 1.3–8.2) and for 24 years or more (OR, 3. 7; 95% CI, 1.5–8.9). In  this group of cases, 
those who started hair-dye use before 1980 had a 3.5-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.5–
7.8) compared with non-users. Use of dark colour and permanent hair-dye types were 
both associated with an increased risk for CLL (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1– 4.9 for dark colour 
and OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4–7.8 for permanent). 
Tavani et al.  (2005) carried out a case–control study in northern Italy aimed at 
evaluating the relationship between lympho id neoplasm and tissue sarcoma and use of 
hair dyes. A total of 966 cases and 1295 ho spital controls were interviewed. No 
significant association with hair-dye use w as seen for any of the ly mphoma subtypes. An 
increased risk for multiple myeloma among semi-permanent dye users was observed 
(OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.02–3.12). Information about colour was not included in the study. 
De Sanjosé et al.  (2006) carried out a multicentric case-control study including seven 
countries in Europe. A tota l of 2302 lymphoma cases and 241 7 controls were pooled to 
study the relationship between hair dyes and the risk for lymphoma. A slight increase in 
risk for lymphoma was observed for ever-use of hair dyes (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00–1.41). 
The risk for lymphoma for those starting use before 1980 was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.09–1.72). 
Among all lymphoma categories, a statistically significant increase in risk for CLL was seen (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.01–2.03). The risk  for lymphoma increased  with the number 
of years of use of dark hair dyes ( P for linear trend, 0.07): four years or less: OR, 1.11 
(95% CI, 0.84–1.46); from 4.5 to 13 year s: OR, 1.28 (95% CI, 0.96–1.70) and for 14 
years or more: OR, 1.45 (95% CI, 1.09–1.94). This study included the data of Benavente 
et al.  (2005), but sensitivity analysis showed that results were not explained by any of the 
individual studies. 
Morton et al.  (2007) carried out a population -based NHL study in the USA among 
1321 cases and 1057 controls, ex amining NHL risk in relation  to reported hair-dye use 
and genetic variation in NAT1  and NAT2 . No increased in risk was observed for ever-
exposure among either males or females (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9–1.6). The OR for females 
exposed to 100 or more lifetime applications  was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0–2.0). Among females, 
a fourfold increase in risk was observed for those using permanent and intense tones for 
more than 15 years before 1980 (OR,  3.9; 95% CI, 1.2–12.5). Concerning NAT1  and  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 611  
 NAT2  variation, an increase in risk was observed for the use of dark or intense permanent 
hair dyes before 1980 among women if they had the NAT2 rapid/intermediate phenotype (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3–8.6) or if they had one or two copies of the NAT*10  allele 
(OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1–8.1). 
Chiu et al.  (2007) carried out a case–control st udy in Eastern Nebraska (USA) to 
evaluate the relationship between personal us e of hair dyes and the risk for t(14;18)-
defined subtypes of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A total of 385 cases and 1432 population 
controls were interviewed. No relation was ob served for ever-use of hair dyes and the risk 
for NHL for either t(14;18)-negativ e or -positive translocation cases. 
A meta-analysis by Takkouche et al.  (2005) included 40 studies on non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple my eloma. All haematopoietic cancers were 
significantly increased among ever-users of hair  dyes (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06–1.20). The 
combined OR estimated for permanent hair -dye use was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99–1.29) and 
for intensive use it was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.98–1.28). The different sensitivity analyses provided a range of estimates from 0.87 for Hodgkin-lymphoma studies to 1.57 for those 
studies including men only. No evaluation of the period of e xposure was included in this 
analysis.

Kramer et al.  (1987) reported a matched case–cont rol study of maternal exposures 
during pregnancy and neuroblastoma diagnosed during the period 1970–1979 in the 
Greater Delaware Valley, USA. Of the 18 1 cases identified, 139 met the eligibility 
criteria, and interviews were completed w ith 104 case families (75%). Control subjects 
were selected by random-digit dialling and were matched wi th cases on age, race and the 
first five digits of their telephone number at the time of diagnosis; the response rate 
among those eligible was 57% (101 of 177). In addition, the authors compared 86 patients who had at least one sibling with a randomly  selected sibling. Moth ers were asked about 
six main exposures, specified  for hypothesis testing, an d about a variety of other 
exposures, including the use of hair-colouring  products. The OR associated with maternal 
exposure to hair dye was 3.00 (90% CI, 1.64–5.48; one-sided  P-value, 0.002; 36 
discordant pairs) in comparison with contro ls selected by telephone and 2.20 (90% CI, 
0.93–5.22; one-sided P-value, 0.07; 16 discordant pairs) in comparison with siblings. 
Bunin et al.  (1987) conducted a case–control study of Wilms’ tumour diagnosed in 
children under 15 during the period 1970–1983 in the Greater Philadelphia (USA) area in 
relation to use of hair dyes by their mothers during pregnancy. Of 152 white cases, 28 were ineligible for a variety of reasons. Inte rviews were completed with the parents of 88 
(71%) of the 124 eligible cases and 88 of 159  (55%) controls, on average 10 years after 
the relevant pregnancy. For Wilms tumour over all, the OR associated with maternal hair-
dye use was 3.6 (95% CI, 1.4– 10.2; based on 32 discordant pairs). A total of 68 cases 
could be classified as genetic (26 cases) (if they were bilateral or had nephroblasto-
matosis) or non-genetic (42 cases)  (if they were unilateral wi thout nephroblastomatosis or  612 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99

 a Wilms tumour-associated congenital anomaly) . The OR associated with maternal use of 
hair-colouring agents was 5.5 (95% CI, 1.0–71.9; on the basis of 13 discordant pairs out of 42) for non-genetic cases and 3.3 (95% CI, 0.7–22.1; on the basis of 13 out of 26 
discordant pairs) for genetic cases. The ORs asso ciated with exposure to hair dyes were 
similar for an interval of 2–10 years a nd for an interval of 11–24 years between 
pregnancy and interview. 
Kuijten et al.  (1990), in an earlier report of the study of Kuijten et al.  (1992), found no 
association between astrocytoma and maternal  use of hair-colou ring produc ts during 
pregnancy (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4–1.8; 37 discordant pairs). 
Olshan et al.  (1993) carried out a case–control study in the USA and Canada using 
the National Wilms Tumor Study to recrui t 200 cases of Wilms tumours to evaluate 
parental exposures during pr egnancy, including hair-colouring pr oducts. Cases were 
matched to 233 controls living in the same neighbourhood and having the same age, 
selected using random-digit di alling. A non-significant in creased risk was observed for 
ever-use of hair dyes during pregnancy (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.66–2.85). There is a 
discrepancy in this paper between the risk estimat ed for cases diagnosed  younger than 
2 years in the Results section  and in the Discussion section (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.16–9.45 
and OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 0.91–9. 33, for Results and Discussion sections, respectively). The 
study had a moderate inclusion rate (61% of the selected cases and 52% of the controls) 
and exposure was assessed by interview. 
Bunin et al.  (1994) carried out a case–control st udy, in the USA and Canada, based 
on the Children’s Cancer Gr oup to evaluate several expo sures occurring during the 
pregnancy and breastfeeding peri ods. The exposures included hair dyes, hair sprays and 
makeup in association with astrocytic glioma ( n = 155) and primitive neuroectodermal 
tumours (PNET) ( n = 166) diagnosed before age 6. Controls ( n = 321) were selected via 
random-digit dialling and matched to the cases by neighbourhood , race and age. No 
association was identified for astrocytoma w ith use of make-up (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7–
1.9), hair spray (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7–2.0), hair colouring (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.3–1.6) or 
use of permanent hair dye (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5–1.5) or for PNET (OR for make–up, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5–1.2; for hairspray, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6–1.7; for hair-colouring 
products, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4–2.6; for permanent hair-dye use 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7.-2.0). The 
analysis was fully adjusted for income leve l for the astrocytoma analysis. Participation 
was around 65%, and exposure was assessed by interview. 
McCredie et al.  (1994) conducted a case–control study of inci dent primary malignant 
brain tumours diagnosed during 1985–1989 in children below 14 years old in Sydney, Australia, and evaluated several hypotheses among which ever-use of hair dyes by the 
mothers. No association was show n (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4–1.6). 
Holly et al.  (2002) carried out a case–control st udy to evaluate childhood brain 
tumours (CBT) and maternal use of hair colouring one month before pregnancy and 
during pregnancy. The study used cancer re gistries from Los Angeles County, the San 
Francisco Bay area and the Seattle area, USA. It included 540 biological mothers of CBT 
children diagnosed during 1984–1991 and 801 control moth ers matched to cases by birth 618 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 year and sex of the index child. Exposure was assessed  through interview. A non-
statistically significant increase in risk was identified for those moth ers using exclusively 
semi-permanent dyes one month before pregnancy or during the first trimester of 
pregnancy (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 0.58–10.0). Exclusive use of permanent dyes, temporary 
dyes or hair darkeners was not related to an increased risk. Exclusive use of semi-
permanent dyes was related to an increased ri sk (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.83–4.7) for users 
before or during pregnancy. No differences by histological tumour type were observed. 
Participation rates were over  70% for cases and controls. 
McCall et al.  (2005) carried out a case–control st udy on neuroblastoma in association 
with exposure to hair-dye use before and during pregnancy. The study recruited 538 cases

were over 70% for both cases and controls. Use of temporary hair dyes was associated with a twofold increased risk for neuroblastom a (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.7). Use of hair 
dyes in the month before pregnancy showed  a 60% increase in risk (OR, 1.6; 95% 
CI, 1.2–2.2). Ever smokers were more likely to have an increased risk for neuroblastoma 
in their offspring if mothers used hair dyes (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.8) or permanent dyes 
(OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2–4.1). No dose-resp onses were reported for permanent dyes. 
Chen et al.  (2006) reported a case–control study that explored the association between 
childhood germ-cell tumours and hair-dye use by the mother before and during pregnancy 
and during breastfeeding, among 273 cases di agnosed between 1993 and 2001 from the 
Children’s Oncology Group in the USA. A total of 418 controls were selected via 
random-digit dialling and matched to th e cases by sex, age and geographical area. 
Maternal use of hair dyes one month before pregnancy was related to a 1.7-fold increased 
risk for boys (95% CI, 1.0–2.8). For mothers who used hair dyes during breastfeeding the overall OR was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0–2.2) and 1.7 among girls (95% CI, 1.1–2.6). 
(e) Other cancer sites 
Ahlbom et al.  (1986) carried out a case–control study in St ockholm and Uppsala, 
Sweden, of 78 patients with astrocytoma diagnosed in 1980–1981, 197 hospital controls 
(with meningioma, pituitary adenoma or cerebral aneurysm) and 92 population controls. 
The ORs for the 23 astrocytoma patients who had dyed their hair were 0.8 (95% CI, 0.4–1.8) relative to 83 hospital controls and 1.5 (95% CI, 0.6–3.7) when compared with 
46 population controls who had dyed their hair. 
Burch et al.  (1987) found that significantly more adults with brain cancer diagnosed 
in Canada in 1977–1981 than hospital controls re ported having used hair dye or hair spray 
(OR, 1.96; P = 0.013; 43/22 discordant pairs). No data by histology were provided, but 
133 of 215 were astrocytomas and 67 of 215 had a glioma or related histology. 
Heineman et al.  (2005) evaluated the risk for glioma in the female white population 
of Nebraska associated to use of hair dy es. Cases were diagnosed between 1988 and 
1993, and controls were retrieved from a previous study, were population-based and were  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 619  
 matched to the case by age. Adjustment by y ear of birth and educational level was done 
throughout the study. Questions about exposu res from hair-dye use before 1985 were 
assessed by personal or proxy interview (79%  of the cases). The study identified an 
increased risk for glioma for ever-use of hair  dye (OR, 1.7; 95% CI , 1.0–2.9) and a 2.4-
fold risk from use of permanent hair dyes (95% CI, 1.3–4.5). The risk for glioblastoma 
multiforme increased 4.9-fold (95%  CI, 1.6–15.7) with exposure  to dark colours for those 
reporting use during 20 years or less. 
Bluhm et al.  (2007) explored the association between use of synthetic hair dyes and 
risk for brain tumours in a hospital-based case–control study, includ ing 489 patients with 
glioma, 197 with meningioma, 96 with acoustic neuroma, and 799 controls. The study, 
carried out in 1994–19 98, identified no incr ease in risk for these tumours from ever-use 
among exposed women or exposed men, including in evaluations of frequency, lifetime 
number of doses, or colour. There was only  one positive associati on linked to use of 
brown colour for more than 20 years for all glioma cases and use of red colour during less 
than 20 years. Both ORs were stronger for acoustic neuroma. [The Working Group was 
concerned about data stratification resulting in very small numbers and high ORs] 
A meta-analysis by Takkouche et al.  (2005) included 15 studies on a wide range of 
cancer sites other than breast, bladder or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The pooled RR was 
1.83 (95% CI, 1.16–2.89) for brain cancer; 1.71 (95% CI, 1.15–2.53) for ovarian cancer; 
0.74 (95% CI, 0.51–1.07) for skin cancer; and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.53–1.90) for cervical cancer. 
Stavraky et al.  (1981), in a case–control study, foun d no significant increase in crude 
or adjusted risks for cancer of the cervix (38 cases), cancer of the ovary (58 cases), cancer 
of the lung (70 cases), cancers of the kidney and bladder (35 cases) or endometrial 
cancers (36 cases) among ever-users of hair-col ouring agents in either Toronto or 
London, Ontario, Canada. 
Holman & Armstrong (1983) examined hair-dye use in a population-based case–
control study of 511 patients with malignant melanoma and individually matched controls 
in Western Australia in 1980–1981. No relationship was found with ever-use of 
permanent hair dyes. The ORs obtained from a conditional logistic regression analysis 
with adjustment for solar exposure, reaction to sunlight and hair colour (Armstrong & 
Holman, 1985) for 86 cases of Hutchinson's melanotic freckle associated with use of 
semi-permanent and temporary dyes were: never used, 1.00; used 1–9 times, 1.5 (95% CI, 
0.3–6.8); used ≥ 10 times, 3.3 (95% CI, 1.0–11.5; P for trend, 0.05). The OR for 
Hutchinson’s melanotic freckle in relation to  use of permanent dyes was not elevated. 
[The Working Group noted that the number of exposed subjects was not reported.] 
Osterlind et al.  (1988a,b) found a negative associatio n with use of permanent or semi-
permanent hair dyes among women with malignant melanoma in Denmark in 1982–1985 (OR for hair dye use, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5– 0.9; 136 exposed cases). Cases of Hutchinson’s 
melanotic freckle were not include d in this population-based study. 
Spitz et al.  (1990) examined hair dye use in a case–control study of 37 male and 
27 female patients with salivary gland cancer  in Texas, USA, in the period 1985–1989. 620 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Controls were patients with other malignancies. Among ever-users of hair dyes, an 
increased OR was found for women (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.5–11.5; 14 cases). There was no 
difference between female cases and controls with  respect to frequency of use, except that 
the OR for use during more than 15 years (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 0.9–12.8) was higher than 
that for shorter duration of u se (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.9–6.2). 
2.2.3  Pooled analysis  (Tables 2.12–2.16)  
A recent analysis (Zhang et al. , 2008) pooled original data from four previously 
reported case–control studies that were part  of the International Lymphoma Epidemiology 
Consortium (InterLymph), including a total of 4461 NHL cases (2123 men and 
2338 women) and 5799 controls (2837 men and 2962 women) to investigate the relationship between personal hair-dye use and risk for NHL. Three studies were from 
the USA, the Connecticut Women’s NHL St udy, the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI)/Surveillance, Epidemio logy, and End Results (SEER ) MultiCenter Case-Control 
Study (NCI/SEER), and the Epidemiology of NHL Study from the University of 
California at San Francisco (UCSF). The three US studies collectivel y represent a total of 
six sites from the SEER programme (Connec ticut, San Francisco-Oakland, Iowa, Detroit, 
Seattle-Puget Sound, and Los Angeles). The ot her case–control study, from Europe (the 
EpiLymph International Case-Control Study of Lymphomas), represents geographic sites 
from six countries (Czech Republic, France, Ge rmany, Ireland, Italy,  and Spain). Each 
study collected detailed information on hair-dye use (including duration of use, total 
number of applications, year of use, and type and colour of hair-dye) and included 
histologically-confirmed incident NHL cases. Among women, 75% of the cases and 70% of the controls reported ever having used  hair dyes. An increased risk for NHL was 
observed among women who started using hair dyes before 1980, compared with non-
users (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.4). After stratification by NHL subtype, hair-dye use was associated with an increased ri sk for follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) but not other NHL subtypes. The 
increased risk for FL (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1. 1–1.9) and CLL/SLL (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–
2.0) associated with hair-dye use was mainly observed among women who started use 
before 1980, with a significant tren d in risk with duration of use ( P < 0.01, 0.02 
respectively). For women who began using the products in 1980 or later, a higher risk for FL was limited to users of dark-coloured hair dyes (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.0) with ORs 
of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1–2.1) for permanent dark-coloured hair dyes and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1–
2.4) for non-permanent dark-coloured dy es. Among men, approximately 10% of cases 
and 10% of controls had ever used hair dyes.  Risk for NHL was not associated with hair-
dye use before or after 1980 among men. The results indicate that personal hair-dye use 
may play a role in the risk for FL and CLL/SLL in women who started use before 1980, and that an increased risk for FL in women starting use in 1980 or later cannot be 
excluded.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 621

3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
3.1 Occupational use of hair dyes: Hair -dye formulations and some of their 
components 
3.1.1  Skin application 
(a) Mouse  
Groups of 50 male and 50 female Swiss Webster mice, 6–8 weeks of age, received 
applications of one of three oxidation (permanent) hair-dye formulations, PP-7588, 
PP-7586 or PP-7585 (all three contained 2,5-toluenediamine sulfate, para-phenylene-
diamine and resorcinol; PP-7586 also contai ned 2,4-diaminoanisole sulfate, PP-7585 
contained meta-phenylenediamine, and PP-7588 cont ained 2,4-toluene-diamine) [see 
reference for additional details on composition], mixed with an equal volume of 6% 
hydrogen peroxide just before use; 0.05 mL of the mixture in acetone was applied to the shaved skin of the interscap ular region. Controls were given acetone or were left 
untreated. For each formulation and for the vehicle control,  one group was treated once 
weekly and another group once every other week for 18 months. Survival at 18 months varied from 58% to 80%. No sign of systemic toxicity was found in any of the dye-treated 
groups. Average body weights were comparab le in all groups throughout the study. The 
incidence of tumours at all sites, including lung tumours, was not statistically different 
between treated and control groups. No skin tumours were observed at the site of 
application (Burnett et al. , 1975). 
The chronic toxicity of 2,4- toluenediamine (2,4-TDA) alon e [purity not specified] or 
in combination with a hair-dye complex (2,5-toluenediamine, para-phenylenediamine, 
and resorcinol) [see reference fo r additional details on compos ition] was studied in groups 
of 28 male and 28 female Swiss Webster mi ce, 4–7 weeks of age, and weighing 15–20 g 
by use of a skin-painting tech nique, whereby a 6% solution of the study materials in a 
water/isopropanol solvent were mixed with equal volumes of either 6% peroxide or 
distilled water at doses of 50, 150 or 1500 μg 2,4-TDA per week. Additional groups of 
vehicle and untreated controls were used. No  information on surviv al was provided. The 
predominant neoplasms seen in these mice were primary pulmonary adenomas and 
adenocarcinomas. Skin neoplasm s were seen in most groups of mice, including untreated 
controls. Statistical analysis of the incidences of skin neoplasms among the various 
groups of mice did not show any significant differences. The 2,4-TDA, alone or mixed 
with the hair-dye complex, did not produce any abnormal proliferation and maturation of the squamous epithelium  of the skin (Giles et al. , 1976). [The Working Group noted the 
lack of information on surv ival, and the use of water as the skin-painting solvent.] 
Groups of 26 male and 22 female DBAf an d 26 male and 26 female strain-A mice, 6–
7 weeks of age, received skin applications of  0.4 mL (reduced to 0.2 mL at 24 weeks for  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 631  
 DBAf mice) of a 10% solution of a comme rcially available semi-permanent hair dye 
(‘GS’), containing, among other constituents [unspecified], 1,4-diamino-2-nitrobenzene (2-nitro- para-phenylene-diamine) and 1,2-diamino-4-nitrobenzene (4-nitro- ortho -
phenylenediamine) in 50% aqueous acetone tw ice a week on the clipped dorsal skin. 
Groups of 16 male and 16 female control mice of each strain received applications of 
acetone alone. When the experiment was termin ated at 80 weeks, four (18%) lymphomas 
and six (27%) tumours of the reproductive tract (four ovarian cystadenomas and two 
uterine fibrosarcomas) had developed in th e 22 treated female DBAf mice within 37–
80 weeks, and one (4%) lymphoma had developed by week 26 among the 26 treated 
males. In control DBAf mice, 1 lymphoma and 1 lung adenoma were found in females 
and 1 hepatoma in males. No difference was observed in the incidence of lymphomas or 
liver or lung tumours between treated and control strain-A mice. No skin tumour at the 
site of application was observed in either strain. Of the treated animals, 27 DBAf mice 
and 32 strain-A mice survived  60–80 weeks without tumours (Searle & Jones, 1977). 
[The Working Group noted that this study was conducted with a low concentration of the 
formulation used in this study.] 
In the same study, groups of 17 male and 15 female DBAf and 16 male and 16 female 
strain-A mice, 6–7 weeks of ag e, received skin applications of 0.4 mL (reduced to 0.2 mL 
at 24 weeks for DBAf mice) of a 10% so lution of a commercially available semi-
permanent hair dye (“RB”), containing, among other constituents [unspecified], 4-amino-2-nitrophenol and CI Acid Black 107, in  50% aqueous acetone twice a week on the 
clipped dorsal skin. The experiment was te rminated at 80 weeks. No significant 
difference was observed in the incidence of tumours at any site between treated and control animals of either strain, and no skin tu mour at the site of application was observed 
in either strain (Searle & Jones, 1977). [The Working Group noted the low concentration 
of the formulation used in this study.] 
In an interim report of the Searle and Jones (1977) study mentioned above, it was 
noted that the tumours arose consistently earlie r in the treated than in the control mice, 
notably in the DBAf strain, in which the fi rst lymphoma was detected after 26 weeks. 
Apart from the early appearance, there was al so an increased tumour  incidence in this 
strain, due mainly to uterine and ovarian tum ours that were not seen in the control group 
(Venitt & Searle, 1976). 
Twelve groups of 50 male and 50 female random-bred Swiss Webster mice, 6–
8 weeks of age, were exposed dermally, once per week for 21–23 months, to different 
hair-dye formulations by placing a 0.05-mL sample on a 1-cm
2 area of the interscapular 
region, which had been clipped free of hair 24  hours before treatment. Nine oxidative hair 
dyes (7401, 7402, 7403, 7404, 7405, 7406, P-21, P-25, and P-26) were mixed with an 
equal volume of 6% hydrogen peroxide and 0.025 ml was applied within 15 minutes. Three semi-permanent hair-dye formulations (P-22, P-23, and P-24) were applied in 0.05 
ml within 30 minutes after opening the bottle. In an earlier study, the composition of these 
hair-dye formulations was given in an extensive table (Burnett et al. , 1976). Three groups 
of 50 males and 50 females served as controls that had their backs shaved but were not 632 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 further treated. After seven and nine months, groups of 10 females and 10 males were 
randomly selected from each group, necropsied and examined by histopathology. The experiment was terminated after 21–23 months. The treatments had no effect on survival. 
The incidences of skin tumours and liver a nd lung lymphomas were not greater than in 
control mice (Burnett et al. , 1980). 
Groups of 60 male and 60 female Swiss Webster mice, eight weeks of age, received 
topical applications of two oxidative and 12 non-oxidative hair-dye formulations supplied 
by five cosmetic companies. The composition of the hair-dye formul ations was described. 
Two groups of 60 male and 60 female Swiss Webster mice served as controls. Each 
oxidative formulation was applied at 0.05 mL/mouse once weekly for 20 months. Each 
non-oxidative dye was applied at  a dose of 0.05 mL per mou se three times weekly for 20 
months. The mice were shaved 24 hours be fore treatment as needed. Control animals 
were shaved only and received no treatment. The application of hair  dyes did not have an 
adverse effect on average body-weight gain or survival of any group. There was no 
significant increase in the incidence of malignant lymphomas in male mice or in liver 
hemangiomas or lung adenomas of both sexes in these studies. Significant increases in 
numbers of malignant lymphomas over those in one of the untreated control groups were observed in female mice in the hair dye-formulation groups treated with formulation 
7602A (19/60 (32%) treated vs 7/60 (12%) control, P < 0.01), formulation 7605 (18/60 
(30%) treated vs 7/60 (12%) control, P < 0.05) and formulation 7610 (23/60 (38%) 
treated vs 7/60 (12%) control, P < 0.01). The authors pointed out that the incidence in 
each treated group is not significantly differ ent from the incidence in the second control 
group in this study, and is within the range of control values previously reported for this strain of mouse. They concluded that these tumours were probably not treatment-related 
(Jacobs et al. , 1984). 
(b) Rat 
Groups of 50 male and 50 female Sprague -Dawley rats, approximately 14 weeks of 
age, received topical applicatio ns of 0.5 mL of permanent hair-dye mixtures containing 
[purity unspecified] either 4% para- toluenediamine or 3% para-toluenediamine, 0.75% 
resorcinol and 0.75% meta- diaminoanisole in vehicle solution (4% Tylose HT, 0.5% 
sodium sulfite, 8.5–13% ammonia (25%), 3.7% ammonium sulfate or as formed by 
neutralization and deionized water to 100. 0%), with 6% hydrogen peroxide added 
immediately before use on a 3-cm
2 area of shaved dorsal skin twice a week for two years. 
The animals were then observed for a further six months. Control groups of 25 males and 
25 females of the same strain and age receive d topical applications of 0.5 mL vehicle 
alone, to which 6% hydrogen peroxide was added immediately before use. Another group 
of 50 males and 50 females of the same strain served as untreated controls. No difference 
in survival was observed between treated, ve hicle control and untreated control groups. 
The skin at the application site, and the liver,  kidney, lung and gross lesions were studied 
histologically. No skin tumour  was observed at the site of application, and there was no  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 633  
 significant difference in the in cidence of tumours, including those of the skin, between 
treated, vehicle control and untreated control groups (Kinkel & Holzmann, 1973). 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female Wistar  rats weighing 120–140 g received topical 
applications of 0.5 mL oxidized para-phenylenediamine [purity unspecified] (1:1 mixture 
of 5% para-phenylenediamine and 2% ammonium hydroxide) and 6% hydrogen 
peroxide on shaved dorsal skin once a week for 18 months. Control rats were shaved and 
treated with the corresponding vehicle. Treated and control groups did not differ 
significantly in body weight gain or survival. All surviving rats were killed after 21 months. Treated rats had a significantly in creased incidence of mammary tumours (5/10 
(50%); P < 0.05 [incidental tumour test]) in comparison with female vehicle-controls 
(0/9). The first mammary tumour observed was a fibrosarcoma, which occurred at week 47; the others were three adenomas and one fibroadenoma. No skin tumour was observed 
at the site of application (Rojanapo et al. , 1986). 
Groups of 60 male and 60 female Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 6–8 weeks) received 
topical applications of an oxidative hair-dye formulation (7406) containing 0.5% 
2-amino-5-nitrophenol, 4.0% para-phenylenediamine, 0.7% para-aminophenol, 2.0% 
4-chlororesorcinol, 5.0% oleic acid, 15.0% isopropanol, 0.2% sodium sulfite, 6.0% ammonia and water to 100%. The formulation was diluted in an equal volume of 6% 
hydrogen peroxide before application, and 0.5 mL were applied to a shaved area of the 
back (approx. 2.5 cm in diameter) twice a w eek up to week 117. Th ree separate, similarly 
treated, concurrent control groups of 60 rats received applications of the vehicle alone. 
Mean body weights and survival were similar in treated and control groups. No skin 
tumours were observed. The incidence of pi tuitary adenomas was increased in females in 
comparison with all three control groups (45/51 (88%) vs 34/50 (65%), 36/51 (71%) and 
35/50 (70%); P < 0.05, χ
2-test). The incidence of mammary gland adenomas was 
increased in comparison with one control group (6/53 (11%) vs 0/49; P < 0.05, χ2-test). 
The authors concluded that the tumours were probably not treatment-related (Burnett & 
Goldenthal, 1988). 
In the same study, groups of 60 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, 6–8 weeks of 
age, received topical applications of an oxid ative hair-dye formulation (7405) containing 
0.4% 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, 6.0% 2,5-diaminoanisole sulfate, 2.0% resorcinol, 0.3% 
ortho -aminophenol, 5.0% oleic acid, 3.0% isopropanol, 0.2% sodium sulfite, 6.0% 
ammonia (29%) and water to 100%. The formulation was diluted in an equal volume of 
6% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.5 mL was applied to a shaved area of the back (approx. 
2.5 cm in diameter) twice a week up to week 117. Mean body weights and survival were 
similar in treated and control groups. No skin tumours were observed. The incidence of 
pituitary adenomas was increased in males in comparison with one of the control groups 
35/52 (67%) vs 14/49; P < 0.01; χ2-test), and no incr ease in the inciden ce of tumours at 
any other site was observed in treated rats compared with control animals. The authors 
concluded that the tumours were probably not treatment-related (Burnett & Goldenthal, 
1988). 634 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 In the same study, groups of 60 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, 6–8 weeks of 
age, received topical applications of an oxid ative hair-dye formulation (7403) containing 
6.0% para-toluenediamine sulfate, 0.7% meta -aminophenol, 1.0% para-aminophenol, 
0.25% 4-nitro- ortho -phenylene diamine, 0.50% 1-naphtol, 15% oleic acid, 10% 
isopropanol, 4.5% glycerine, 9.0% propylene glycol, 0.2% sodium sulphite, 9.0% ammonia and water to 100%. The formulation was diluted in an equal volume of 6% 
hydrogen peroxide before application, and 0.5 mL was applied to a shaved area of the 
back (approx. 2.5 cm in diameter) twice a w eek until week 117. Mean body weights and 
survival were similar in treated and control groups. The incidence of mammary gland 
adenomas was increased in comparison w ith one control gr oup (10/52 (19%) vs 0/49; 
P < 0.01, χ
2-test). There was no significant increase in the incidence of tumours at any 
site, and no skin tumour was observed. The authors concluded that the tumours were 
probably not treatment-related (Burnett & Goldenthal, 1988). [The Working Group 
wondered why the tumours were assu med not to be treatment-related.] 
3.1.2  Subcutaneous injection 
(a) Rat 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats weighing 120–140 g received subcutaneous 
injections of 0.5 mL oxidized para-phenylenediamine (5% para-phenylenediamine in 2% 
ammonium hydroxide and 1.8% sodium chloride) in an equal volume of 6% hydrogen 
peroxide in the hip area every other week for 18 months. Controls were injected similarly with vehicle only. There was no significant di fference between treated and control groups 
in body-weight gain or survival. All survivors were killed after 21 months. The incidence 
of mammary lesions [duct ectasia or adenosis ] was significantly increased (4/7 (57%); 
P < 0.05 incidental tumour test) in females in comparison with vehi cle controls (0/10). 
Two uterine tumours, an adenocarcinoma and an endometrial polyp were observed in 
females; no such tumours were observed in  controls. Two sarcomas [not otherwise 
classified] at the injection site and two lipo mas were also observed in treated animals 
(Rojanapo et al. , 1986). [The Working Group noted the small number of animals used in 
this study.]

 4.2 Genetic and related effects 
4.2.1  Occupational use of hair dyes 
(a) Humans 
Chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes were examined in a study of 
60 professional hair colourists (28 men, 28.4 ± 9.4 years old; 32 wo men, 23.3 ± 5.1 years 
old) and 36 control subjects matched for age and sex (17 men, 28.1 ± 7.3 years old; 
19 women, 25.3 ± 6.5 years old) (Kirkland et al. , 1978) in the United Kingdom. 
Information was recorded on smoking habits, alcohol consumption, medical history, use of medicinal drugs and drugs of abuse, infections, vaccinations and exposure to X-rays. 
Details of occupational exposure to hair dy es were also collected: women had done an 
average of 11 000 permanent and 5000 semipermanent hair-tinting operations and men had done 15 000 permanent and 6000 semi-permanent operations, over periods ranging 
from 1 to 15 years. Blood samples were taken at the time of interview, but the time since 
the last hair-tint application (to themselves or clients) was not recorded. Among the chromosomal aberrations, more gaps were found per cell among female tinters than in 
controls (0.065 vs 0.048; P < 0.02) but not among male tinters (0.064 vs 0.063). The 
number of breaks per cell (assumed from the observed aberrations) was not altered among women (0.028 vs 0.031) but was lower among men (0.034 vs 0.047; P < 0.05). After 
exclusion of subjects exposed to high doses of diagnostic X-rays or who recently had viral 
infections these differences di sappeared (breaks in tinters vs controls: women, 0.023 vs 
0.027; men, 0.036 vs 0.038). Reallocation of this sm aller set of subjects according to 
whether or not their own hair was dyed rev ealed that the number of breaks per cell was 
higher among women who dyed their hair (dyed vs not dyed, 0.031 vs 0.018; P < 0.02) 
and lower among men who dyed their hair (0.023 vs 0.044; P < 0.01). The women had 
given themselves an average of 90 permanent and 10 semi-permanent tints and the men 
an average of 30 permanent tints [semi-pe rmanent tints not indicated] over a period 
similar to their occupational exposure. The authors stated that th ere was no association 
between chromosomal damage and the duration and/or frequency of hair dyeing in the 
women. [The Working Group noted the absence of  data to substantiate this statement.] 
They reported that 20/23 female and 11/18 male tinters wore protective gloves for all 
applications of permanent a nd semi-permanent hair tints and deduced that most of the 
subjects would receive greater exposure to hair-dye components when their own hair was treated. The finding that the number of breaks per cell was lower among men who dyed 
their hair than among those who did not was explained by the age difference between the 
group with tinted hair (22.7 ± 5.1 years, n = 10) and the group with non-tinted hair 
(31.8 ± 10.1, n = 17). Kirkland et al.  (1978) based their argument on the observation of 
Brown et al.  (1965) that there was much  less chromosomal damage of all types in 48-hour 
blood cultures from men aged 15–24 than from men aged 25–34, whereas there was no 
difference among women in these age ranges. 636 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Babish et al. , (1991) conducted a study in New Yo rk State, USA, on cosmetologists 
(91 women, 7 men) who were occupationally exposed to a wide range of chemicals, including hair dyes, and who had reported a pr evalence of skin rashes that was twice as 
high as that of a control group of 87 female dental personnel (29% vs 15%). The two 
groups were matched for median age, smoking status and proportion of subjects (13–16%) who had had their hair permed or dyed within seven days of the study. At the end of 
a normal working day, subjects from each group provided a urine sample, which was later 
concentrated and tested for mutagenicity in S. typhimurium  TA100 in the presence and 
absence of S9. In the presence of S9, there was no difference between the groups, but in 
tests conducted without S9 the frequency of mutagenic urine samples was 15% higher 
among cosmetologists (39%) than among dental personnel (24%). Multivariate analysis, with adjustment for age and smoking habits, revealed an OR of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.1–3.8) for 
the presence of urinary mutagens in cosmetolog ists compared with dental personnel. [The 
Working Group noted the inadequate reporting of the results.] 
Sardaş et al.  (1997) assessed the cytogenic effect s of occupational exposure to 
oxidation hair dyes by using three assays in professional hair colourists. The assays were 
analysis of sister chromatid exchange (SCE ) in circulating lymphocytes to evaluate the 
interchange of DNA-replication products at  apparently homologous chromosomal loci, 
the single-cell gel electroph oresis assay to detect the presence of DNA strand-
breaks/alkali-labile damage, and the Ames assay with Salmonella typhimurium  strain 
TA98 to detect the mutagenicity of the urine.  The ability of these assays to detect genetic 
damage caused by oxidation hair dyes compared with closely matched controls produced 
the following findings: (i) The SCE assay could not detect an effect in lymphocytes of 
exposed subjects from whom complete data we re obtained. However, subjects (controls 
and exposed) with a history of smoking had a slightly higher frequency of SCE than the 
non-smokers in both groups. (ii) The extent of DNA migration (single-cell gel electrophoresis assay) did not distinguish betw een the samples of exposed and control 
subjects. Like the SCE results, the exposed  smokers and control smokers showed a 
greater proportion of damaged lymphocytes with apparent change in migration of DNA in the single-cell gel electrophor esis assay. (iii) No clear differences in the mutagenic 
activity of the urine samples were observed between the exposed and control subjects. 
 (b) Experimental systems 
Wang et al.  (1991) showed that of 169 commercial oxidative-type (hydrogen 
peroxide) hair-dye formulations, 150 (89%) were mutagenic in the Salmonella  
mutagenicity assay. Of the 18 components of these hair dyes, nine showed various 
degrees of mutagenicity: 2,4-diaminoanisole, 4-nitro- ortho -phenylenediamine, 2-nitro-
para-phenylenediamine, 2,5-diaminoanisole, 2-amino-5-nitrophenol, meta-phenylene-
diamine, ortho -phenylenediamine, 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, and 2,5-diaminotoluene. Three 
hair-dye components ( para-phenylenediamine, 2,5-diaminotoluene and 2,5-diamino-
anisole) became strongly mutagenic after oxidation by hydrogen peroxide: the mutagenic 
product of para-phenylenediamine was identified as th e known trimer Bandrowski's base.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 637  
 [The Working Group considered formation of this mutagenic product unlikely to happen 
under practical hair-dyeing conditions.] 2,4-Diaminotoluene, a hair-dye component, was also mutagenic: this compound has been shown to be a carcinogen in rats and is used in 
large amounts in the polyurethane-foam industry. [The Working Group noted that this 
compound has been taken off the market in the early 1970s] (Ames et al. , 1975). 
A total of 13 commercial hair-dye prod ucts made in China were tested for 
mutagenicity in two short-term assays, the Salmonella typhimurium  mutagenicity test in 
strains TA98 and TA100 and the in-vivo mi cronucleus assay with mouse bone-marrow 
polychromatic erythrocytes. The results showed that the 13 hair dyes were not mutagenic 
in strains TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 . In the micronucleus test, no effect was 
observed (Wang et al. , 1991). 
Albano et al.  (1982) found that of 25 commercial permanent hair-dye formulations 
containing para-phenylenediamine, resorcinol and aminophenols incubated with 
hydrogen peroxide, 12 were mutagenic to S. typhimurium  TA98 only in the presence of 
S9. Without the addition of hydrogen peroxi de, mutagenicity was reduced for three dyes 
and disappeared for three others. Four of six formula tions, with degrees of mutagenicity 
varying from zero to high, administered topically with 3% hydrogen peroxide to male rats, induced urine that was mutagenic to S. typhimurium  TA98 in the presence of S9. 
Ferguson et al.  (1990) tested 40 products, chosen from among 12 brands of 
commercially available hair colourants u sed in New Zealand, for mutagenicity in 
S. typhimurium  TA98 and TA100 without S9; activators were added when recommended. 
Twenty-three of these products were mutage nic in one or both strains. When 10 
mutagenic hair-dye preparations were tested in the presence of the drug verapamil, used for treating cardiac conditions (Ferguson & Baguley, 1988), the mutagenic activity of four 
was decreased and that of two was increased (Ferguson et al. , 1990). 
Watanabe et al.  (1990) found that two of four commercial hair-dye formulations 
containing phenylenediamines and aminophenols (two of which also contained 
2,5-diaminophenol), when oxidized with 6% hydrogen peroxide, were mutagenic to 
S. typhimurium  TA98 in the presence of Kanechlor 500-induced S9. When toxicity was 
reduced by adsorbing bacteric idal products on blue rayon, peroxide treatment increased 
the mutagenicity of all preparations to diff erent extents; in the two preparations with 
markedly increased mutageni city, activity was attributed to the oxidation of 
meta -phenylenediamine to 2,7-diaminophenazine, itself a potent mutagen. 
Ammenheuser and Warren (1979) applied two commercial oxidative hair-colouring 
products at 10–30 mL, both with and without hydrogen peroxide, to the backs of male Sprague-Dawley rats [number unspecified]. Both colourants contained 1,4-diamino-2-
nitrobenzene and 1,2-diamino-4-nitrobenzene (4-nitro- ortho -phenylenediamine). The 
solutions were left on the hair for 20 min and then removed by shampooing and rinsing. Urine was collected before and every 24 hours after product application for four days and 
tested on S. typhimurium  TA1538, the volumes of urine applied to each plate varying 
from 3.4 to 11.5% of the total volume. Urine samples collected during the first 24 hours from rats treated with either of the preparations were mutagenic (two to three times 638 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 background); no significant mutagenicity w as observed in urine samples collected two to 
four days after application. Pr ior reaction with hydrogen peroxi de had little or no effect on 
the mutagenicity of the urine. 
Stamberg et al.  (1979) tested henna and its active colouring ingredient, 2-hydroxy-
1,4-naphthoquinone, for mutagenicity in S. typhimurium  TA98, TA100, TA1535, 
TA1537 and TA1538. Henna was not mutagenic to any strain, but 2-hydroxy-1,4-
naphthoquinone was mutagenic to TA 98, in the absence  of S9 only. 
Matsuki et al.  (1981) isolated 2-amino-5-methoxy-2´(or 3 ′)-methylindamine and 
2-amino-5-methoxy-2´(or 3 ′)-methylindoaniline from an oxidative reaction mixture of 
2,5-diaminotoluene and 2,4-di aminotoluene. These compounds were found to be highly 
mutagenic to S. typhimurium  TA98 in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system. 
Burnett et al.  (1981), in a study of heritable translocation, painted groups of 25 male 
Sprague-Dawley CD rats twice weekly for 10  weeks on the shaved dorsal skin with 
0.5 mL of a semi-permanent dye formulation (comprising base ingred ients plus 0.12% CI 
Disperse Blue 1, 0.04% CI Disperse Black 9, 0.01% HC Red No. 3, 0.21% HC Yellow 
No. 3, 0.50% HC Blue No. 1, 0.06% Acid Orange No. 3, 0.07% CI Disperse Violet 
No. 11 and 0.01% HC Yellow No. 2), or with 0.5 mL of an oxidative dye formulation (comprising base ingredients plus 2.2% para-phenylenediamine, 3.1% N,N-bis(2- 
hydroxyethyl)- para-phenylenediamine sulfate, 1.0% resorcinol and meta -aminophenol, 
mixed 1:1 with 6% hydrogen peroxide just before use). The animals were then mated with untreated female rats. Male F
1 progeny were subsequently mated with other 
untreated females, and the resulting pregnanci es were arrested at day 16 of gestation. No 
difference in average litter size or frequency of successful matings at the F 1 mating was 
seen between controls and the two exposed grou ps. Furthermore, there was no effect on 
the number of live fetuses, implan tations or resorptions at the F 2 (total litters analysed: 
275 controls, 261 in the oxidation dye group and 271 in the semi-permanent dye group). 
4.2.2  Personal use of hair dyes 
Hofer et al.  (1983) studied chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes from six women 
and four men who volunteered to have their hair dyed and a similar group of 10 controls 
matched for age (men: hair-dyed, 35.7 ± 6.7; controls, 30.8 ± 6.4; women: hair-dyed, 
30.3 ± 5.7; controls, 35.0 ± 5.8). Records were taken of smoking habits, alcohol consumption and medical drug use and, during  the experiment, exposure to X-rays, illness 
and vaccinations. There were more smokers in the test group. None of the volunteers had 
used hair dyes or shades for at least one year  before entering the study, and the control 
group did not use hair colourants during the study. The treated group had their hair dyed 
13 times at intervals of three to six week s with commercial preparations containing 
mixtures of aminotoluenes, aminophenols and hydroxybenzenes and, in some cases, 
naphthol, as active ingredients; the colourin g product used was chosen according to each 
subject’s hair colour, and the same material was used throughout th e study. The colouring 
preparations were mixed (1:1) with 3–6% hydrogen peroxide. Nine blood samples were  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 639  
 taken: three weeks before the first treatm ent (control sample), 24 hours after a sham 
dyeing (no dye or hydrogen peroxide) and 24 hours after each of the first three and last 
four dyeing procedures. No difference w as observed between the control and treated 
groups in the percentage of cells with one or  more structural aberrations (excluding gaps) 
before treatment, after sham-dyeing or after treatment. Subdivision of the groups according to sex revealed no difference. A sign ificant increase in aberration rate with age 
was observed among the male but not the female subjects. Neither smoking nor X-ray 
exposure had an effect. In conjunction with this study, sister chromatid exchange was 
examined in peripheral lympho cytes; no evidence w as found of an effect on the frequency 
(Turanitz et al. , 1983). 
Kirkland et al.  (1981) studied sister chromatid  exchange in the peripheral 
lymphocytes of a small group of volunt eers comprising 13 women and one man 
immediately before and 6 hours and seven days after one normal application of four semi-
permanent and 10 permanent hair dyes, all of which were mutagenic to Salmonella 
typhimurium  TA1538 and TA98 in the presence of  metabolic activation. There was no 
consistent increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchange per cell. 
In a study in the USA involving 30  women aged 45–65 years, Burnett et al. , (1979) 
determined mutagenicity in urine specimens collected before and during a 24-hour period 
immediately after application of dark shades of several hair-colouring products containing 
high levels of dyes and dye intermediates. Many of the women had used hair dyes regularly for over 20 years. Concentrated  (XAD-2 resin) urine samples did not increase 
the number of reverse mutations in S. typhimurium  TA1538 in the presence of an 
exogenous metabolic system from rat liver (S9). [The Working Group noted the inadequate reporting of the results.] 
Espinoza et al.  (2008) evaluated micronuclei in urothelial cells to determine the 
possible association between genetic damage an d use of hair dyes in 128 Spanish women. 
In addition, 72 women who participated as controls in a bladder cancer case–control study 
in Spain were included as controls. To avoid any kind of bias, only those cells with a 
typical morphology corresponding to the ur othelial cells were scored. The mean 
micronucleus frequency in the overall study group was 9.72 ± 0.82 micronclei/1000 cells 
and did not vary by hair-dye exposure: 9.90 micronuclei/1000 cells (± 0.78) observed in 
women using hair dyes during the preceding month vs 9.50 micronuclei/1000 cells 
(± 2.45) observed in women who did not use hair dye in the preceding month. Use of hair 
dyes in recent months was associated with a higher frequency of micronuclei, but the 
association was not statis tically significant ( P = 0.536). 
4.3 Mechanistic considerations 
Hair dyes are difficult to evaluate as a grou p. On the one hand, the exposure situation 
is different for hairdressers and personal user s, and on the other hand it seems particularly 
difficult to obtain informati on about a causal relationship. Significant associations can 
hardly be expected from epidemiological in vestigations. The expe rience with aromatic 640 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 amines somehow directed the attention from the beginning towards genotoxicity, and 
towards the bladder as the target tissue. Si nce bladder tumours are not uncommon in the 
general population, one would expect the tum our incidence to increa se significantly only 
if exposures to hair dye-derived agents are re latively high, i.e. significantly above the 
background of other “bladd er-specific” agents, for inst ance from smoking. Moreover, 
since bladder tumours seem to be the result of  genotoxic as well as acute toxic effects, it is 
difficult to assess how (frequently changing) hair-dye components and other exogenous 
factors contribute to variou s biological effects. A monocausal approach seems to be 
particularly questionable in this case. The heterogeneous results of the many 
epidemiological studies reflect this dilemma. Bolt & Golka (2007) concluded from an 
extensive review of the litera ture that there seems to be no relevant bladder-cancer risk 
associated with the use of hair dyes that are available today. In  other words, the potency is 
considered to be low. On the other hand, the epidemiological results from studies among 
hairdressers indicate that—with all reservation s—the potential of occupational exposure 
to contribute to the overall ca ncer risk cannot be excluded. 
More recently, other possible target tissues have been taken into account. Ambrosone 
et al.  (2007) looked for effect markers of aromatic and heterocyclic amines as well as 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarb ons in exfoliated breast ductal  epithelial cells from breast 
milk as etiological factors for breast-cancer  risk. DNA adducts for each class were 
detected, and the presence of 4-aminobipheny l adducts was associated with the use of 
hair-colouring products. Although this finding does not prove a causal relationship, it 
underlines the view that environmental exposu res contribute to lesi ons in many tissues 
and thereby add to the risk. The suspicion of  a relationship betwee n hair dyes and cancer 
developed when some of the components were found to be genotoxic in in-vitro tests, and 
subsequently also carcinogenic in rodents af ter oral administration. The results were 
negative however, if the amines or co mmercial mixtures containing carcinogenic 
components were tested via topical application. Although the latter route of 
administration is more analogou s to the current use of hair dyes, the other experiments 
indicate a carcinogenic potential under certain  circumstances. If comparable exposure 
conditions would be strenuously required in  carcinogen testing, the relevance of the 
results of many if not most animal experiments becomes questionable. However, it is 
important to keep in mind the difference between hazard and risk. 
A particular aspect with permanent hair colourants is that the colourant is generated 
by oxidation of an amine and the structure of the oxidation product is normally not known 
from the peer-reviewed literature. Prim ary intermediates are for instance para-
phenylenediamine or para-aminophenol, and couplers are meta-aminophenols or meta -
hydroxyphenols. In the presence of peroxide , the primary intermediate and the coupler 
react with each other and coloured oligomers are formed. By itself,  para-phenylene-
diamine is only weakly genoto xic, but a mutagenic trimer (Bandrowski’s base) is formed 
under oxidizing conditions. Moreover, additional activating pathways must be considered 
with diamines and phenolic amines: quinoid structures are involved, which react with 
cellular proteins. In this context it is interesting to note that para-phenylendiamine is an  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 641  
 established contact sensitizer, which indicates that relevant amounts penetrate the skin 
and are biologically active. The incidence of contact sensitizat ion is increased particularly 
among beauticians and hairdressers (Iorizzo et al., 2002). 
In the light of the above, it seems difficult to differentiate between different exposure 
situations on the basis if ep idemiological observations. If there are hazardous components 
involved in exposure to hair colourants , they would probably contribute to the 
background exposure of aromatic amines. Fo r practical purposes, and in line with the 
ALARA principle, established carcinogens should be avoided, omitted or exchanged for less hazardous components, and biological effect  markers should be u sed to establish to 
what extent the professional handling of hair dyes and their personal use contribute to the 
background or total load of aromatic amine exposure. 
5. Summary of Data Reported 
5.1 Exposure data  
5.1.1  Hair Dyes: Production, use, occ upational exposure and exposure after 
personal use 
Modern hair dyes may be classified as a) oxidative (permanent) hair dyes, b) semi-
permanent and c) temporary dyes. Oxidative hair dyes represent approximately 80% of the market and consist of colourless primary intermediates ( para-substituted aromatic 
amines) and couplers ( meta-substituted aromatic amines an d other compounds) that, in 
the presence of peroxide, form the dye by a chemical reaction. The concentration of 
oxidative hair-dye ingredients is approximately proportional to their degree of shade: dark 
colours tend to contain the highest concentrations of colouring ingredients (up to 3% 
primary intermediates during use) wher eas light shades (blond) contain lower 
concentrations. Semi-permanent (direct) ha ir dyes contain colour  molecules of low 
molecular weight, such as nitro-phenols, nitro-aminophenols and nitro-phenylene-
diamines. Temporary dyes contain direct hair dyes of high molecular weight, such as azo, 
triphenylamine and indamine colourants. A worldwide survey in 2005 showed the 
presence of 50 ingredients in oxidative, 43 in semi-permanent and 88 ingredients in 
temporary hair dyes. The most frequently used oxidative hair-d ye ingredients are para-
phenylenediamine, resorcinol, 2,5-diaminotoluene, para- and meta-aminophenol, 4-
amino-2-hydroxytoluene, 4-amino- meta-cresol and 2-methyl-5-hydroxyethylamino-
phenol. The majority of oxidative hair-dye ingredients have been on the market since the 1930s. Most semi-permanent or temporary hair dyes have a much more limited use. 
Occupational exposure studies found no or on ly traces of hair-dye ingredients in the 
air of hair salons, whereas measurable amount s were detected on hairdressers’ hands. The 
major occupational exposure pathway appears to be via skin contact, followed by dermal 
absorption. The same exposure pathway applies to personal (consumer) use of hair dyes. 642 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 Hair dyes have been subject to regulation s in many countries, and the number of 
substances permitted for use in hair dyes has been  restricted during the past 40 years; in 
2007, 135 individual ingredients were no longer allowed in the European Union for use in 
hair dyes. 
5.2 Human carcinogenicity data 
5.2.1  Professional use of hair colourants 
The Working Group reviewed the literature on cancer at several sites in hairdressers, 
barbers and beauticians. Many additional studies have been published since the previous 
review in 1993 (IARC Monograp h 57). These include severa l case–control studies and a 
few cohort studies. Most data  from cohort studies derive from linkage between census 
data and cancer registries in Scandinavian countries, with limited potential to adjust for 
confounding by important correlates of cancer ri sk, e.g., lifestyle and reproductive factors. 
The Working Group noted that  the evidence mainly concer ned exposures that occurred 
before 1980s, and often much earlier. 
(a) Bladder cancer 
The cohort studies indicated an increased risk  for cancer of the urinary bladder among 
male hairdressers, but not among female hairdressers. In a large Scandinavian cohort of 
hairdressers, barbers, beauticians and other re lated workers identified in the 1970 census 
and followed-up for 20 years, there was a si gnificant 50% increase in risk for bladder 
cancer in men and a non-significant 10% d ecrease in risk in women. Allowance for 
smoking was generally not possible, although results for lung cancer suggest that higher 
exposure to tobacco in hairdressers could not totally account for the bladder cancer 
excess. 
More than 20 case–control st udies were available for ev aluation. Most of these, 
including three of the larger studies, report ed increased risks in the range of 1.3–1.7 in 
male hairdressers. A pooled analysis of 11 studies conducted in six European countries 
found no significant increase in risk among male or female hairdressers. Overall, risks 
appeared generally lower for women than for men. The number of exposed subjects was generally small, and did not allow a reliable assessment of the risk by duration and period 
of exposure. 
In view of the consistent yet modest increase in risk reported in studies of hairdressers 
and barbers, especially men, and in the absen ce of solid data on the relation between 
duration and period of exposure, the Working Group concluded that there was limited 
evidence  of an increased risk for blad der cancer in hairdressers. 
(b) Haematological malignancies 
With regards to cancers of the haematol ogical system, the heterogeneity in the 
diseases included and the differences in th e classification used often hampered  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 643  
 comparison between the results of different st udies. Although one cohort study of barbers 
among male US veterans and an Italian case–control study reported significant increases in risk for multiple myeloma based on on ly few exposed cases, these results were not 
replicated in other studies. In the large Scandinavian cohort, no excess was found in either 
sex for multiple myeloma or for other haematological malignancies. 
(c) Breast cancer 
Many studies on breast cancer, including the largest case–control and cohort studies, 
did not show any increased risk for breast cancer  associated with professional use of hair 
colourants. 
(d) Childhood cancers 
One cohort study and five case–control studies investigat ed the risk for childhood 
cancers in the offspring of hairdressers and ba rbers. Although some positive associations 
were reported, an overall evaluation is diff icult because of the different sites and/or 
histologies investigated in va rious studies and the problems in the identification of the 
relevant period of exposure (before or around conception, or during pregnancy). 
(e) Other sites 
(i) Ovarian cancer 
A modest increase in risk fo r ovarian cancer was reported in two cohorts of US 
cosmetologists and Scandinavian  hairdressers, which was signif icant only in the latter 
study. The excess in risk app eared stronger in—or limited to—women exposed in earlier 
periods. No case–control study was available for evaluation. The lack  of adjustment for 
potential confounders, especially reproductive history and oral contraceptive use, does not 
allow confounding to be ruled out. 
(ii) Lung cancer 
Small increases in lung cancer risk of the or der of 20–40% were found in most cohort 
studies, which did not, however, adequately adjust for smoking. A higher prevalence of smokers among hairdressers than in the genera l population was reported in Scandinavia 
and the USA. No informative case–control study was available for evaluation. The 
Working Group concluded that tobacco smoking  cannot be excluded as a likely cause of 
the modest excess in lung can cer observed in hairdressers. 
5.2.2  Personal use of hair colourants 
The Working Group revised and evaluated the epidemiological evidence of an 
association between cancer at several s ites and personal use of hair dyes. 644 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 (a) Bladder cancer 
Several studies with contradi ctory results have been pu blished. Increased risks for 
bladder cancer were reported in two studies in the USA, while no association was found 
in three larger studies, two from the USA and one from Spain. Th ese recent studies had 
similar characteristics in design and methodology. 
One study from the USA suggested an incr eased risk for bladder cancer among users 
of hair colourants, in particular among those who exclusively used permanent hair dyes. 
Further, this study showed that exclusive use of permanent dyes among subjects with 
slow acetylation ( NAT2  genotype) or among CYP1A2 slow metabolizers was associated 
with an increased risk for bladder cancer. Th e other studies did not confirm these results. 
In the Spanish study, there was no indicatio n of an increased risk for bladder cancer 
associated with the NAT2  genotype, but there was a no n-significant association with 
NAT1*10 . The available cohort studies were la rgely negative for bladder cancer. The 
available meta-analyses did not show an association. 
The Working Group considered that the av ailable evidence for cancer of the bladder 
was overall inadequate . 
(b) Haematological malignancies 
The results for this tumour type were difficult to interpret: many different 
malignancies are involved, and many of th e studies do not prov ide analyses for the 
different disease entities. Historically, the results have been inconsistent in identifying an 
increased risk. While cohort studies were  largely negative for haematological 
malignancies, the results of case–control studi es varied greatly. In those that showed an 
increased risk, the increase tended to be moderate . A recent pooled analysis was evaluated 
with particular interest because it was a la rge study evaluating ha ir-dye exposure in 
relation to single lymphoma entities including case–control da ta derived from Canada, the 
USA and six countries in Euro pe. The study showed an ov erall increased risk of 1.1 
among women who were regular users, and of 1.3 among those women who had started regular hair-dye use before 1980. The risk was consistently elevated for follicular 
lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaem ia, but not for other types. For these 
lymphoma subtypes, the risk did not vary by intensity, years of use or type of exposure, remaining generally of the order 1.2–1.4. When the period of first use was considered, the 
increased risk for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was mainly observed among those who 
started use before 1980, with a statistical ly significant increase in risk among those 
reporting use for more than 20 years. For follicular ly mphoma, increased risks were 
observed throughout the two study periods. Overall, the Working Group considered this 
evidence to be inadequate . 
(c) Breast cancer 
For breast cancer the Working Gr oup considered the evidence as inadequate  based on 
several studies, none of which except one showed an association.  HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS, AND HAIR COLOURANTS 645  
 (d) Childhood cancers 
For childhood cancers, the studies evaluated dealt with childhood brain tumours and 
Wilms tumours. The Working Group discussed  in depth the potential biases and study 
limitations that could explain some of the increased risks observed for some brain 
tumours, and considered that some of the reported associations could not be simply 
explained by recall bias, as mothers may not ha ve known about this hypothesis at the time 
of the studies. The Working Group considered that the evidence prese nted in the studies 
was inadequate . 
(e) Other sites 
Only a few studies were available to th e Working Group, and no evaluation was 
made. 
5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 
Various commercially available hair-dye formulations and various laboratory 
preparations of hair dyes were tested fo r carcinogenicity in mice or rats by skin 
application in 11 studies and by subcutane ous injection in a single study in rats. 
In three studies by skin pa inting in mice, all using different formulations, increased 
incidences of lymphomas were observed in female mice compared with concurrent 
controls, for five different formulations. The increased incidences were not significant 
when compared with historical controls. In three studies by skin painting in rats, a 
significant increase in the incidence of mamma ry adenomas in females was observed for 
two formulations, and a significant increase in  pituitary adenomas was seen in females for 
one formulation and in males for a different formulation. In the single subcutaneous 
injection study in rats, an increased inci dence in mammary and uterine tumours was 
observed. The other studies eith er showed no increased incidence of tumours at any site 
or were inadequate for evaluation. 
5.4 Other relevant data 
Studies that investigated the induction of  chromosomal aberrations in peripheral 
blood lymphocytes of professional hair-colourists or in volunteers who had their hair dyed 
reported no effect. The same is true for tw o studies that investigated sister chromatid 
exchange in lymphocytes of hairdressers. Two studies on the mutagenicity of urine 
collected from hair-dye users and cosmetolog ists were inadequate for evaluation. One 
study assessed sister chromatid exchange, DN A breakage (measured by single-cell gel 
electrophoresis) in lymphocytes and mutagenicity  in urine in professi onal hair-colourists. 
No effect was seen for any of these three en dpoints. A study on micronucleus formation 
in hair-dye users did not show a difference with non-user controls. 646 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 99  
 In an early study, 90% of a large numb er of commercial oxidative hair-dye 
formulations were mutagenic in bacteria. In later studies, this percentage dropped to 0–
50%. The hair-colouring product henna did not show bacterial mutagenicity in one study. 
When tested separately, its active ingredient was mutagenic. 
The urine of rats skin-paint ed with oxidative hair-colouring products was mutagenic 
when collected during the first 24 hours.  The mutagenicity disappeared afterwards. 
No effects were seen in a heritable transl ocation assay in rats skin-painted twice 
weekly for ten weeks with a sem i-permanent dye formulation. 
6. Evaluation  
6.1 Cancer in humans 
There is limited evidence  in humans for the carcinogenici ty of occupational exposures 
as a hairdresser or barber. 
There is inadequate evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of personal use of 
hair colourants. 
6.2 Cancer in experimental animals 
There is limited evidence  in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of hair 
colourants. 
6.3 Overall evaluation 
Occupational exposures as a hairdresser or barber are probably carcinogenic to 
humans  (Group 2A) . 
Personal use of hair colourants is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans  
(Group 3) .
