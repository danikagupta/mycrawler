Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth of green algae Chlorella
sp. on wastewaters sampled from four different points of the treatment process flow of a
local municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) and how well the algal growth
removed nitrogen, phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and metal ions from the
wastewaters. The four wastewaters were wastewater before primary settling (#1
wastewater), wastewater after primary settling (#2 wastewater), wastewater after activated
sludge tank (#3 wastewater), and centrate (#4 wastewater), which is the wastewater
generated in sludge centrifuge. The average specific growth rates in the exponential period
were 0.412, 0.429, 0.343, and 0.948 day−1for wastewaters #1, #2, #3, and #4, respectively.
The removal rates of NH 4–N were 82.4%, 74.7%, and 78.3% for wastewaters #1, #2, and
#4, respectively. For #3 wastewater, 62.5% of NO 3–N, the major inorganic nitrogen form,
was removed with 6.3-fold of NO 2–N generated. From wastewaters #1, #2, and #4, 83.2%,
90.6%, and 85.6% phosphorus and 50.9%, 56.5%, and 83.0% COD were removed,
respectively. Only 4.7% was removed in #3 wastewater and the COD in #3 wastewater
increased slightly after algal growth, probably due to the excretion of small
photosynthetic organic molecules by algae. Metal ions, especially Al, Ca, Fe, Mg,
and Mn in centrate, were found to be removed very efficiently. The results of this study
suggest that growing algae in nutrient-rich centrate offers a new option of applying

With global shortages of fossil fuels, especially oil and natural gas, a major focus has developed
worldwide on renewable biofuel production [ 1]. Algae, with a much higher unit area oil yield
than terrestrial oilseed crops [ 2], are a promising biofuel feedstock. Another issue from
burning of fossil fuels is the ever-increasing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission [ 3], whose trend
will continue with the fast pace of modern industry development if a feasible energy sourcereplacement could not be found. Algae, which can assimilate CO
2photoautotrophically or
mixtrophically, is a perfect candidate for CO 2sequestration and greenhouse gas reduction.
As mentioned in the close-out report for the Aquatic Species Program by the US
Department of Energy, the concept of using wastewater as a medium and source of nutrientsfor algae production found a new life with the energy crisis of the 1970s, which had thebenefit of serving multiple needs —both environmental and energy-related [ 2]. Compared to
the conventional wastewater treatment process, which introduces activated sludge, abiological floc, to degrade organic carbonaceous matter to CO
2, algae can assimilate
organic pollutants into cellular constituents such as lipid and carbohydrate, thus achieving
pollutant reduction in a more environment-friendly way.
The research on using algae cultivation as a tertiary wastewater treatment process started
as early as the 1970s [ 4–6]. While the initial purpose of introducing algae pond process was
to further treat the secondary effluent in order to prevent from causing eutrophication [ 7,8],
it was observed that the treatment removed nutrients from settled domestic sewage moreefficiently than activated sewage process did, suggesting that it would be more economicaland desirable to employ the algal system as the secondary rather than tertiary treatmentprocess [ 8]. Algae species Chlorella was widely applied for wastewater treatment and had
proven abilities of removing nitrogen, phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand (COD)with different retention times ranging from 10 h to 42 days, mixing with bacteria or not(Table 1), which shows the potential of replacing activated sludge process in a secondary or
tertiary step in view of nutrient reduction and biomass production.
The present study was a part of the ongoing research to evaluate cultivation of green algae
Chlorella sp. on municipal wastewaters taken from different points of the process flow of a
local municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP). The wastewater before primary settling(#1 wastewater), wastewater after primary settling (#2 wastewater), wastewater after activatedsludge tank (called “effluent ”in latter context, although it is not the final effluent for the
MWTP; #3 wastewater), and centrate (#4 wastewater), which is the wastewater generated insludge centrifuge, contain different levels of inorganics and organics, which may be beneficialor inhibitory to the growth of microalgae. Algal cultivation in #2 and #3 wastewaters hasbeen tested by several of the above-mentioned researchers [ 7–9]. Little work has been carried
out in #1 and #4 wastewaters. Therefore, the main objective of the present research was to
compare the growth of Chlorella sp. on these four wastewaters and their abilities of removing
nitrogen, phosphorus, COD, and metals. The suitability of introducing algae cultivation into aconventional wastewater treatment process flow is also discussed.
Methods

Characteristics of Wastewaters
Wastewaters were collected from four different points in the Metropolitan Wastewater
Treatment Plant at Saint Paul, Minnesota. They are wastewaters #1, #2, #3, and #4, whichwere sampled from tanks before primary settling, after primary settling, secondary settlingtank, and centrate line after sludge centrifuge, respectively. All wastewaters were filteredusing glass microfiber filters (934-AH, Whatman, USA) to remove large particles andindigenous bacteria. Ammonia nitrogen (NH
3–N), nitrate nitrogen (NO 3–N), nitrite
nitrogen (NO 2–N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and COD were determined
for all samples following the Hach DR 5000 Spectrophotometer Manual [ 14].
Determination of Algal Growth
Samples were taken from the culture media every day for measurement of optical density at
680 nm (OD 680) using a spectrophotometer (Genesys 5, Spectronic Instruments, UK) as theTable 1 Summary of major nutrient removal efficiencies by algal cultivation.

where OD 0is the optical density at the initial day, OD tis the optical density measured

Analysis of Inorganic CompoundsLiquid samples for nutrient consumption analysis were collected every other day during
the 9-day test period. The collected samples were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min
and the supernatants were collected for analyses of NH
3–N, NO 3–N, NO 2–N, TN, TP,
and COD. The measurements of NH 3–N, NO 3–N, NO 2–N, TN, TP, and COD were
performed following the Hach DR 5000 Spectrophotometer Manual [ 14]. The metal ion
concentrations in all of the four wastewat ers before and after algal cultivation were
analyzed. Ten milliliters of centrifuged samples were acidified with 1% ( v/v) nitric acid
before analysis. A set of 15 elements including Al, B, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na,Ni, P, Pb, and Zn was analyzed by a inductively coupled plasma atomic emissionspectrometer (Perkin Elmer Optima 3000, USA), which consists of an echellepolychrometer and two solid-state detectors. The detectors are referred to as segmented-array charged-coupled devices. One is used for the ultraviolet range (167 –375 nm) and
the other for the visible range (375 –782 nm). The spectrometer is purged with nitrogen
gas. Nutrient removal rates were calculated by dividing the difference between the first
day and final day concentrations by the first day concentration, then multiplied by 100,and expressed as percentage.
Results and Discussion
Properties of the Four Wastewaters
The chemical compositions of the four wastewaters are listed in Table 2. Primary settling
did not change the chemical characteristics of the wastewaters much but, however, othertreatments that the effluent and centrate received resulted in significant changes in chemicalcomposition of wastewaters. The effluent is stabilized by the activated sludge process inwhich ammonium had been oxidized to n itrate, phosphorus absorbed, and COD
significantly reduced. The effluent is dischargeable with further disinfection. The centrateis generated from a physical process (sludge centrifuge) and thus retains high levels ofammonium, phosphorous, and COD.
The optimal inorganic N/P ratio for freshwater algae growth was suggested to be in the
range of 6.8 –10 [15–17]. While taking a close look at the four wastewaters, it is noticed that
only wastewaters before and after primary settling had close-to-optimal inorganic N/Pratios, 5.9 and 4.7, respectively. The inorganic N/P ratio of the effluent was 53.2, much
higher than the optimal ratio, indicating a high phosphorus limitation. In contrast, the
inorganic N/P ratio of the centrate was 0.36, much less than the optimal ratio, indicating ahigh nitrogen limitation.Appl Biochem BiotechnolAlgal Growth Curves in the Four Wastewaters
Algal growths in terms of optical density OD 680in the four wastewaters under axenic
condition were plotted in Fig. 1. No lag phases were observed in all of the four curves,
indicating that this wild-isolated algae Chlorella sp. could adapt well in all of the four
wastewaters. Similar growth patterns, with exponential phases in the first 3 days followedby stationary phases in the next 6 days were present for all wastewaters, except the centrate,
in which the exponential phase lasted 1 day more before entering into a stationary phase.
Algae in wastewaters before and after primary settling had highly overlapped growth curvesalong the time, which coincided with the similar chemical composition of the twowastewaters, elucidating the strong relationship between the nutrient levels and algalgrowth [ 18].
Moreover, it can be found that the algal growth was significantly enhanced in the
centrate because of its much higher levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and COD than the otherthree wastewaters (Table 2). Therefore, the results show that the centrate is the best media
for algal growth despite its highly unbalanced ratio of N/P. The stationary phase OD ofcentrate-grown algae was about five times of those grown on the other three wastewaters.The average specific GR in the first 3 days were 0.412, 0.429, 0.343, and 0.948 day

wastewaters before and after primary settling, effluent, and centrate, respectively. The GRTable 2 Characteristics of the four wastewaters sampled from the St. Paul Metropolitan Wastewater

(0.34 day−1) who used a mixture of settled manure and secondarily treated effluent with an
ammonium nitrogen of 30 mg/L. Algal cells grew better in wastewater after primary settlingthan in the effluent because of the higher nutrients contained in the former one, which wasalso evidenced by Tam and Wong [ 8]. Thus, algal ponds with high inoculums might be
more suitable to be installed as a secondary rather than a tertiary treatment process [ 8]. In
addition, the centrate with very high nutrient level is found to promote rather than inhibitalgal growth, which serves as the basis for applying algal process in MWTP in a new wayto manage the nutrient load for the aeration tank to which the centrate is returned.
Inorganic Nitrogen, Total Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and CODNH
4–N, the only inorganic nitrogen form in the wastewaters before and after primary
settling and centrate, was significantly reduced. The removal rates for #1, #2, and #4 were82.4%, 74.7%, and 78.3%, respectively (Table 3). Algae growth removed 62.5% of NO
3–N
(the major inorganic nitrogen form in effluent) from the effluent with 6.3-fold of NO 2–N
generated. The TN removal rates were 68.4%, 68.5%, 50.8%, and 82.8%, respectively
(Table 3). This study shows that Chlorella sp. could use ammonium or nitrate, the two
primary nitrogen sources for many organisms [ 19]. The relative constancy of uptake,
irrespective of nitrogen source, is tentatively considered to be due to the saturation of theassimilator to the production of amino groupings for entry into nitrogenous metabolism.This homeostasis of nitrogen assimilation enables it to maximize growth in changingenvironmental conditions [ 20].
The increase in nitrite was accompanied by a decrease in nitrate in the effluent after
cultivation of Chlorella sp. (Fig. 2b), which is an interesting phenomenon. Nitrate
assimilation by plant involves two transport and two reduction steps to produce ammoniumin the chloroplast [ 21,22]. Therefore, nitrite is generated in the process of nitrate being
reduced to ammonium and it is possible that part of the nitrite produced was excreted into
the media [ 23].
Removal of phosphorus up to 90% (Table 3) from wastewater #1, #2, and #4 by algae
growth was very effective. However, only 4.7% phosphorus was removed from the effluent(#3 wastewater). Table 4shows the inorganic N/P ratios of the four wastewaters before and
after algal cultivation. Compared to the optimal inorganic N/P ratio for algae growth whichis in the range of 6.8 –10 as mentioned before, effluent had a N/P ratio of 52.3, although it
dropped to 20.8 at the end of the experiment, showing a severe phosphorus limitation foralgal growth. However, the unbalanced N/P ratio of the centrate affected neither nitrogen

must be considered in evaluating the effects of nutrient compositions on algal growth. Otherstudies [ 24,25] also revealed that the nutrient removal efficiency is related to the level of
nutrients in wastewater and the extent of nutrients utilized by algal growth or incorporatedinto algal tissues. Phosphorus in centrate, though around 30 times of that in wastewaters
before and after primary settling, was removed at a comparable ratio, indicating that rapid
and luxury uptake of phosphorus is an ability of the algae species Chlorella to synthesize
and accumulate polyphosphates in their bodies [ 26].
COD removal efficiency varied much among different wastewaters. While removal rates
of 50.9%, 56.5%, and 83.0% were achieved for wastewaters #1, #2, and #4, respectively,removal rate for wastewater #3 is a negative number, indicating that organics were excretedout instead of being taken up by algae grown in effluent. The two opposite results thathappened to COD indicate two different metabolic pathways, i.e., heterotrophic andautotrophic growth of algae under different culture conditions. Eny [ 27] found that the
metabolic pathway of Chlorella can alter with supply of organic substrates such as organic
acids or glucose, which means that they can perform heterotrophic growth besides thecommon autotrophic one of using CO
2as the sole carbon source. The organic substances
may function directly as an essential organic nutrient [ 28] or act as an accessory growth
factor [ 29]. Heterotrophic growth of Chlorella can proceed in a much faster way [ 30,31]b y
directly incorporating organic substrate in the oxidative assimilation process for storagematerial production [ 32]. The carbon matters in effluent are mostly inert after activated
sludge treatment and thus cannot be further utilized by algae. When the organic substrate isnot available, autotrophic growth uses CO
2as the carbon source, excreting small molecular
organic substances such as glycolic acid to the environment as a product of photosyntheticcarbon reduction cycle [ 33], which is the reason why COD in effluent increased after algal

in the 9-day algal growth period. All nutrients decreased rapidly due to fast assimilation byalgae in the first three culture days followed by slight increases as a result of release ofcellular nutrients, suggesting that a retention time of 3 days is enough to achieve maximumnutrient reductions when using this strain under the current settings. Compared with other
studies when maximum nutrient removals were achieved (Table 1), it is found that the
retention time could be shortened to 10 h by introducing bacteria into the system, formingan algal –bacterial symbiosis, while the same treatment efficiencies were still obtained [ 7].
One bottleneck that hinders the widespread application of the algal treatment process is itsrelative long hydraulic retention time (HRT) to obtain efficient nutrient removal whencompared with the conventional activated sludge process, which can achieve efficientoverall reduction of COD, ammonium, and phosphorus within a much shorter HRT of 4 –
6h[ 34]. Further research will focus on the algae –bacteria consortia on nutrient removal
from wastewater and shortening the sampling interval to get better understanding of thenutrient dynamics during the exponential growth period.
Metal Ion Removal
The levels of Cd, Cr, and Pb, both before and after algal treatment, were under the
detectable limits and, therefore, they are not included in Table 5. Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Zn
were found to be removed from all the four wastewaters very efficiently, with removal ratesranging from 56.5% to 100% (Table 6). Microalgae were reported to be more efficient in
sequestering metal species from solution than bacterial and fungal biomass [ 35]. The
mechanism of the effectiveness in removing heavy metals from wastewater by microalgaeis related to their large surface area and high binding affinity [ 36]. Different algal species
have different sizes, shapes, and cell wall compositions, which affect their metal bindingefficiency [ 37], and the cell wall, in particular, is the main binding site for metals [ 38]. A
mathematical model was successfully applied by Khoshmanesh et al. [ 35] to describe the
uptake of cadmium by algae, which includes two distinct steps in the process: an initialrapid uptake of metal ions due to attachment to the cell wall, followed by a relatively slowuptake due to membrane transport of the ion through the cell wall into the cell cytoplasm.
The distinguished removal (95.4%) of the high level of Ca in centrate by algae compared
with those (22.6%, 25.7%, and 45.6%) in the other three wastewaters caught our attention,which needs further exploration of the possible causes. The computer program PHREEQCdeveloped by Song et al. [ 39] suggested that, in a given solution with a certain phosphate
concentration, the solution pH value and Ca/P ratio are two controlling factors forphosphate recovery by precipitation, an increase in either of which can enhance thethermodynamic driving force for the calcium phosphate precipitation. Therefore, besides
the excessive uptake of phosphorus by algae cells as mentioned before, it is speculated that,

approaching 10), calcium and phosphorus formed calcium phosphates, the precipitation ofwhich helped remove both from the centrate significantly. Recovery of phosphorus ascalcium phosphates than other forms is far more promising from the industry's viewpoint[40]. However, there are still a lot of obstacles from the technological side [ 41] because a
lot of factors influence the precipitation of calcium phosphates, such as the concentrations
of phosphate and calcium, the pH value [ 42], the ionic strength, the temperature, and the
impurities of the solution [ 43,44]. If the precipitation of calcium phosphorus by growing
algae in the centrate is validated in the future, it would add one more side benefit to thecentrate treatment by the algal process.
Conclusions
The results from this study demonstrated the feasibility of cultivating Chlorella sp. in four
wastewaters sampled from different locations in MWTP. Chlorella sp. could adapt well in
all of the four wastewaters with no lag phases observed. Algal growth was significantly
enhanced in the centrate because of its much higher levels of nitrogen, phosphorus andCOD than those in the other three wastewaters. The high phosphorus limitation in theeffluent could not support a productive algal growth and efficient nutrient removal,opposing the idea of applying algal cultivation as a tertiary process. Although the treatmentof wastewaters before and after primary settling is more efficient in nutrient reduction thanthat of effluent, nitrogen and COD could not be removed in a way comparable to currentprevailing activated sludge process within a certain retention time. Thus, the proposal ofapplying it as a secondary wastewater treatment process is not ready for scale-upapplication either. However, the great growth in centrate offers a new option of applyingthe algal process in MWTP to manage nutrient load for the aeration tank where the centrate
from sludge centrifuge is returned. The unbalanced N/P ratio of the centrate is found to
affect neither nitrogen nor phosphorus removal, suggesting the importance of absoluteabundance of both nutrients for algal growth, irrespective of the optimal relative ratio.Metal ions, especially Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, and Mn in centrate, were found to be removed veryefficiently. Besides the luxury uptake and assimilation of phosphorus to polyphosphate byalgae, the elevated pH after cultivating algae in centrate, causing the precipitation ofcalcium phosphates, may also contribute to a great extent of calcium removal.
