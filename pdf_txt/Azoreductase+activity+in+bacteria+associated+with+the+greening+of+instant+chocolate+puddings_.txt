Abstract :  In the year 2018 a report published by TechSci 
Research entitled “India Chocolate Market Forecast and 
Opportunities, 2018” reiterated that the chocolate market 
earnings in India has witnessed the growth rate of 21% from 
2013 -2018. Indian chocolate market witnessed USD 3.2 billion 
revenues in 2018. Indian chocolate market is divided into 4 
sectors, in which bar chocolates  accounts for highest share of 
36%. Hence, We had chosen to study the commercially 
available bar chocolates through culture dependent methods. 
We had selected 3 commercially available bar chocolates 
namely Cadbury Dairy milk, Cadbury 5 Star and Cadbury 
Perk. Bacteria were isolated from these 3 brands of chocolate 
by streak plate method. Microbiological and Biochemical 
assays such as Simple staining, Gram staining, Catalase test, 
Methyl Red test, Oxidase test, Vogus Proskaur test, Indole  
test, Citrate utili zation test and Starch hydrolysis test were 
performed. The bacterial isolates were found to be Rod shaped 
and Gram negative. The bacterial isolates were found to be 
negative for all the above mentioned tests except Methyl Red 
and Starch hydrolysis test. Th us, these findings highlight  the 
impending  health hazard  posed by the commercially available 
bar chocolates.

I. INTRODUCTION  
During 2018 TechSci Research released a report entitled 
“India Chocola te Market Forecast and Opportunities, 
2018” that confirmed the fact that the revenues of Indian 
chocolate market showed the annual growth rate of around 
21% for the time period between the years of 2013 -2018[1]. 
The chocolate industry is considered as the majority 
admired product in the food and beverage processing 
industry in India. In 2018, the chocolate market in India 
reached the revenues of around 3.2 Billion U.S.$ due to the 
ever increasing gifting practice in India and enlargement in 
the overall inco me among the working class which has 
fuelled the demand for chocolate products in the country[1]. 
Indian chocolate market is divided into four segments in 
which Bar  chocolates segments accounts for maximum 
revenue of 36% [1]. It was reported that instant c hocolate 
puddings were found to be spoiled by Pseudomonas sp. 
Strain AZR1 and Klebsiella sp.  Strain AZR2 due to the

microbial spoilage of UHT -treated milk chocolate by 
Enterobacter sp. and Micrococc us sp has been reported [3]. 
We had chosen to examine the microbiota of commercially 
available bar chocolates through microbiological and 
biochemical methods. We had selected the following bar 
chocolates namely Cadbury’s Dairy milk, 5 Star and Perk 
for thi s study. Streak plate culture method was used to 
isolate the pure cultures of bacteria from these 3 bar 
chocolates. Biochemical and Microbiological tests like 
Starch hydrolysis test, Citrate utilization test, Indole test, 
Vogus Proskaur test, Methyl Red te st, Oxidase test, 
Catalase test, Simple staining and Gram staining w as done 
for the bacterial isolates. B acterial isolates were Rod shaped 
and Gram negative. Except for Methyl Red test and Starch 
hydrolysis test, the bacterial isolates were found to be 
negative for all the above mentioned tests. Thus, these 
findings highlight the impending health  hazard  due to  the 
commercially available bar chocolates to the Indian  
consumers

B. Simple staining  
 
A loop packed with  suspension of the bacterial isolates of 
the bar chocolates was taken on a dirt free slide and 
broadened and later air dried. The bacterial smear was heat 
fixed. Later, a drop of  crystal violet was added for 15 -60 S. 
The slide was rinsed in water, air dri ed and later observed 
under microscope. Rod shape of bacteria was observed  
[4,5].  
 
C. Gram staining  
 
A loop packed with suspension of the bacterial isolates of 
the bar chocolates was taken on dirt free slide slide, spread 
and later heat fixed. Crystal violet was added and 
maintained for 60 S and further  the bacterial smear was 
rinsed in  water. Gram’s iodine was added and the slide was 
left untouched for one minute. It was again washed in  
water and later the decolouring agent was added and it was 
again washed in water . Safranin was added and incubated  
for one minute. It was again washed in water and the glass 
slide  was examined under microscope [6]. The bacteri a 
isolated from the bar chocolates were found to be Gram 
negative (Figure  2).

F. Indole test  
The peptone broth was prepared . After autoclaving 
at autoclaved at 121ºC, 15 lbs for 15 minutes , the 
bacterial isolates of the bar chocolates was 
inoculated into the test tubes and later incubated. 
Later 1ml of Kovac’s reagent was introduced and 
was shaken well [9]. No cherry red formation 
indicated that  the bacterial isolates of the bar 
chocolates were found to be –ve  for indole test 
(Figure 5).

G. Methyl red test  
MR-VP broth in  the test tubes were kept at 121ºC for 15 
minutes. The MR -VP broth w as inoculated with the bacteria  
isolated  from  the bar  chocolates  and later incubated  and 5 -6 
drops of methyl red solution was added [10]. The formation 
of Red color indicated positive result for methyl Red test for 
the isolated bacteria  of the bar chocolates (Figure 6).

H. Vogus proskaur test  
MR-VP broth was autoclaved at 121ºC , 15 lbs for a 
period of 15 minutes. After sterilization, the isolates of the 
bacteria from the  bar chocolates was introduced into the 
medium and were incubated. Barrit’s reagent was added  
and mixed well[11]. The absence of deep rose color 
indicated the negative result for Vogus Proskaur test for the 
bacterial isolates of the bar chocolates (Figure  7).

 I. Citrate utilization test  
The simmon’s citrate agar  medium  was prepared and later 
was autoclaved at 121ºC,  15 lbs for 15 minutes. The 
sterilized simmon’s citrate agar medium   were made as 
agar slants. The isolated bacteria  of the bar chocolates were 
inoculated. The test tubes were incubated [12] and the re 
was no Blue color formation. Hence, the isolated bacteri a 
of the bar chocolates was found to be negative for citrate 
utilization (Figure  8).

J. Antibiotic disc test - Kirby bauer method  
Using sterile technique, the agar plate was inoculated with 
the isolated bacteria as follows: A sterile cotton swab was 
dipped with bacterial culture and using the swab, the entire 
agar surface was streaked with the bacterial culture in 
horizontal, vertical and edges of the petri plate to ensure 
heavy bacterial growth over the complete surface. The 
petriplate was dried for about 5 minutes. The antibiotic 
disc such as ampicillin, streptomycin and nitrofurantoin 
were placed at equal distanc e with forceps dipped in 
alcohol and flame. The antibiotic discs were gently pressed 
down with the wooden edge of the cotton swab [13]. The 
petriplates were incubated for 24 hours at 37ºC. The region 
of inhibition was observed around all the three antibiot ic 
discs. (Figure  9)

 K. Starch hydrolysis test  
Nutrient starch agar medium was prepared, sterilized at 
121ºC at  15lbs pressure for 15 minutes and dispersed into 
petriplates. The bacterial isolates of the bar chocolates was 
inoculated onto the medium and kept at 37ºC for 24 hours. 
Following the incubation, the plates were flooded with 
lugol’s iodine. The bacterial i solates were found to be 
positive for starch hydrolysis (Figure 10)

“India Chocolate Market Forecast and Opportuni ties, 2018”  
report confirmed the fact that the Indian chocolate market 
revenues showed the annual growth rate of approximately 
21% for between 2013 -2018[1]. The chocolate industry is 
considered as one among the major food and beverage 
processing industrie s in India which is evident from the fact 
that in the year 2018, the indian chocolate market reached 
the revenues of approximately 3.2 Billion U.S.$ due to 
increase in gifting practice and overall income among the 
working class in India [1].  Our study is significant to address 
the issue of quality of the chocolates. Our study correlates 
with earlier reports of chocolate puddings found to be spoiled 
by Pseudomonas sp. Strain AZR1 and Klebsiella sp.  Strain 
AZR2 due to the Azoreductase activity of the spoilag e 
organisms [2]. Our study also emphasizes the earlier report 
of the microbial spoilage of UHT -treated milk chocolate by 
Enterobacter sp. and Micrococcus sp [3].  
Thus, our study highlight the impending health hazard posed 
by the commercially available bar chochlates to the Indian  
consumers.
