Abstract  12 
Microplastic represents a r ising proportion of marine litter and is widely distributed throughout 13 
a range of marine habitats. Correspondingly, the number of reports of species containing 14 
microplastics increases annually. Nephrops norvegicus  in the Firth of Clyde have previously been 15 
shown to retain large aggregations of microplastic fibres. The potential for N. norvegicus  to retain 16 
plastic over an extended time period increases the likelihood of any associated negative impacts 17 
to the individ ual. This study represents the longest observation of the impacts of microplastic 18 
retention in invertebrates. We exposed N. norvegicus  to plastic over eight months to determine 19 
the impacts of extended exposure. Over this period we compared the feeding rate , body 20 
mass, and nutritional state of plastic -fed N. norvegicus to that of fed and starved control 21 
groups.  Following the experimental period, the plastic -fed langoustine contained microplastic 22 
aggregations comparable to those of small individuals from the Clyde Sea Area. Comparisons 23 
between fed, unfed and plastic -fed individuals indicated a reduction in feeding rate, body mass, 24 
and metabolic rate as well as catabolism of stored lipids in plastic contaminated animals. We 25 
conclude that N. norvegicus  exposed t o high levels of environmental microplastic pollution may 26 
experience reduced nutrient availability.  This can result in reduced population stability and may 27 
affect the viability of local fisheries.  28

 33 Introduction  34 
Uptake of plastic debris has been recorded in numerous vertebrate taxa, including birds ( Burg er 35 
and Gochfeld, 2004 ; Ryan, 2008 ), fish ( Lusher et al., 2013 ), and mammals ( Baird and Hooker, 36 
2000 ). However, as this large plastic debris breaks down it forms microplastic (<5mm), which 37 
represents an increasing proportion of global marine litter ( Barnes et al., 2009 ). This increase has 38 
resulted in a rise in the number of records of plastic uptake by wild -caught invertebrates 39 
(Devriese et al., 2015 ; Mathalon and Hill, 2014 ; Murray and Cowie, 2011 ; Welden and Cowie, 40 
2016 ). The uptake of microplastics may occu r through a variety of routes, including active 41 
ingestion, a result of mistaking plastics for prey items; or passively, through contaminated prey 42 
and/or sediment. Both of these routes have been observed in laboratory experiments ( Bern, 43 
1990 ; Besseling et al., 2012 ; Farrell and Nelson, 2013 ; Frias et al., 2014 ). Uptake has even been 44 
observed through the gills during respiration ( Watts et al., 2014b ).  45 
The Impacts of Plastic Ingestion  46 
The ingestion of plastic by marine vertebrates has been seen to have a range of effects on the 47 
organism. One of the most apparent impacts is mortality due to gut damage as observed in turtles 48 
(Lutz, 1990 ; Tomás et al., 2002 ) and porpoises ( Baird and Hooker, 2000 ), or starvation as a result 49 
of plastic taking up the space of food in the stomach.  Damage to the gut may also result in reduced 50 
digestive efficiency and nutrient uptake, known as nutrient dilution ( McCauley and Bjorndal, 51 
1999 ). In birds, this has been linked to reduced body condition as conta minated individuals utilise 52 
the body’s stores to bridge the energy gap ( Connors and Smith, 1982 ; Pierce et al., 2004 ; Ryan, 53 
1988 ). Finally, animals may also be subject to the transfer of hydrophobic contaminants, as 54 
previously observed in seabirds ( Ryan et al., 1988 ). This is particularly concerning in areas where 55 
plastics exposed to sea water containing hydrophobic contaminants ma y develop loads much 56 
higher than that of the surrounding water ( Endo et al., 2005 ; Teuten et al., 2009 ). 57 
Microplastic and Invertebrates  58 
Despite the previous work examining the impacts of plastic debris on both wild and captive 59 
vertebrates, the effect of microplastic ingestion by invertebrates have yet to be determined. Of 60 
those studies that address these impacts, most deal with short -term effects. For example, 61 
microplastic consumption has been seen to reduce feeding in Arenicola marina  (Besseling et al., 62 
2012 ; Wright et al., 2013 ) and shore crabs, Carcinus maenas , fed on chronic  levels of plastic fibres 63 
over four week periods showed a dramatic reduction in both feeding and scope for growth ( Watts 64 
et al., 2015 ). A. marina  has also been seen to take up hydrophobic contaminants from plastics, 65 
which ma y result in harmful effects to the animal ( Besseling et al., 2012 ). Responses have also 66 been observed in terrestrial invertebrates. Examination of the impacts of polyethylene powder 67 
(< 400µm) on the worm, Lumbricus terrestris , indicated reduced growth rate at all microplastic 68 
concentrations and increased mortality at concentrations over 28% ( Huerta Lwanga et al., 2016 ). 69 
A small number of species have demonstrated minimal or no effects as the res ult of plastic 70 
ingestion. The larvae of the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla  were seen to readily ingest 71 
polyethylene spheres; however, this ingestion was not seen to significantly increase mortality, 72 
despite a slight reduction in survivorship in the highes t concentration ( Kaposi et al., 2014 ). The 73 
marine isopod  Idotea emarginata  also did not discriminate against plastics, ingesting beads, 74 
fragments, and fibres. The isopod s were able to pass ingested microplastic, with no significant 75 
level of accumulation observed; as a result, it was determined that microplastic ingestion had no 76 
negative impact on the health of the organism ( Hämer et al., 2014 ). Such variation in the impact 77 
of microplastic ingestion between species is to be expected. Biotic factors, such as microplastic 78 
uptake rate, residence time of microplastic in the gut, and tolerance to low nutrient conditions 79 
each influence the cumulativ e impact of exposure.  80 
Microplastic Uptake and Retention by N. norvegicus  81 
Nephrops norvegicus  are decapod crustaceans found in fine sediments at depths between 20 and 82 
800 meters across the Northeast Atlantic and in the Mediterranean. Their diet is mainly 83 
composed of bivalve molluscs, polychaetes, echinoderms, fish, and crustaceans including 84 
conspecifics ( Aguzzi and Sardà, 2008 ). N. norvegicus  recovered from the Clyde Sea Area have been 85 
seen to contain large aggregations of mic roplastic fibres ( Murray and Cowie, 2011 ; Welden and 86 
Cowie, 2016 ), and may be at increased risk of the negative impacts of microplastic uptake. These 87 
large aggregations are believed to be the result of the complex gut morphology of N. norvegicus. 88 
The digestive system has three main portions, the foregut, mid gut and narrow hind gut, and a set 89 
of chitinous structures known as the gastric mill ( Welden et al., 2015 ). Examination of wild caught 90 
N. norvegicus  has shown microplastic aggregations directly anterior to the gastric mill and the 91 
narrowing at the entrance to the hind gut; it is though that these structures prevent some 92 
microplastics from leaving the digestive  tract (Welden and Cowie, 2016).  93 
It has been seen that N. norvegicus  may lose aggregated microplastic during moult, as the foregut 94 
lining is shed (Welden and Cowie, 2016). N. norvegicus moult occurs biannually in male and 95 
immature individuals, and annually in mature females. This extended period over which they may 96 
retain microplastics suggests that the species are at increased risk of the negative impacts of 97 
plastic ingestion. For N. nor vegicus  populations in areas of high environmental microplastic 98 
contamination individuals may develop large aggregations of plastic fibres in the fore -gut, which 99 
increases the likelihood and magnitude of these effects (Welden and Cowie, 2016).  100 It is hypot hesised that the level of microplastic contamination observed in N. norvegicus  from the 101 
Clyde Sea Area may result in numerous impacts on the nutritional state of N. norvegicus , with the 102 
potential for false satiation and starvation in highly affected indivi duals. In this paper we aim to 103 
assess the impact of large fibre aggregations on nutritional health and mortality of this 104 
economically important population. In an eight month exposure trial, the impacts of long -term 105 
exposure to microplastics on food consump tion and growth in male N. norvegicus was examined.  106 
Methods  107 
Male N. norvegicus  were sampled from the Clyde Sea Area in early spring using 50 mm mesh otter 108 
trawls. Prior to the experiment, captured animals were kept in holding tanks (270 litres) supplied 109 
with recirculating sea water, and were fed on whole squid mantle that had been r insed thoroughly 110 
with distilled water to remove any attached microplastic. After the group had moulted, 34 111 
individuals were sacrificed for gut content analysis to confirm that the animals were free from 112 
plastics, and 36 were transferred to lidded individua l tanks (10 litres). Each tank contained rock 113 
shelters, and was maintained at ambient temperature with a 12 hour light/dark regime.  114 
A closed 68 litre header tank was used to circulate filtered seawater to prevent introduction of 115 
foreign microplastics. Wat er leaving tanks passed through a 0.2mm filter to prevent plastics from 116 
the treatment group being passed to control animals, and all water flowed through a secondary 117 
protein skimmer and filter before re -entering the header tank (Fig. 1). The system was red uced 118 
to 50% volume before being topped up with filtered seawater approximately every 2 weeks;  more 119 
frequently during warmer weather.  Water levels were monitored on a daily basis and ad hoc 120 
additions occasionally made to maintain constant volume . Air-stones and pumps were used to 121 
ensure sufficient oxygenation of the water and slate shelters were provided for cover.  122 
 123  124 
Fig. 1. Individual tank set up with model of sea water circulation system  125 
After a month -long acclimatisation  period  in the experime ntal tanks, the carapace length and 126 
body mass of each individual was recorded. The average carapace length at day 0 was 31.357 mm, 127 
and the average mass was 19.28 g. Total haemolymph protein was also determined using a 128 
Bradford assay, described in full belo w.  129 
The 36 individuals were then divided into three groups (12 individuals per group): the treatment 130 
group, fed a 1.5 g squid mantle seeded with five polypropylene fibres; the fed control group, fed 131 
with 1.5 g of squid mantle only; and the starved control group. Fibres were chosen for this 132 
experiment as they were the most abundant category of microplastic recovered in previous 133 
studies of ingestion by N. norvegicus . Similarly, they are the dominant microplastic category 134 
observed in environmental sampling.  135 
Polypropylene rope was chosen owing to its widespread use in the fishing industry and 136 
prevalence in previously studied N. norvegicus  from the Clyde Sea Area (Welden and Cowie, 137 
2016). Fibres were removed from twisted split film polypropylene rope  supplied b y Gaelforce . 138 
Individual fibres measured between 3 mm and 5 mm in length and were approximately 0.2 mm 139 
in diameter.  N. norvegicus  in the C lyde Sea Area are known to be subject to high aggregations of 140 
microplastic. Five fibres per feeding would expose the p lastic -fed group to 360 fibres over the 141 
experimental period, although not all were expected to be ingested and it is uncertain what 142 
proportion of ingested plastic is retained in the foregut.  143 
Previous observations of nutritional state in N. norvegicus  have  indicated that animals can survive 144 
for long periods without food ( Watts et al., 2014a ). The starved control was used to provide a 145 
baseline for reduced nutritional health. Over the eight month experimental period the treatme nt 146 
group and fed control were fed every two days, and feeding rate in both groups was determined 147 
by weighing the un -eaten food. After eight months, a second haemolymph sample was taken from 148 
each animal, after which the animal was killed and immediately dis sected; the stomach was 149 
removed and transferred directly into 80% ethanol, and the hepatopancr eas removed,  weighed, 150 
and frozen at -80˚C.  151 
Foregut Microplastics  152 
Microplastic retention was determined by examining the foregut of each individual under stereo 153 
microscope, as outlined in Murray and Cowie (2011) and Welden and Cowie (2016). Plastic 154 
recovered were visually examined to determine that they originated from the experimental 155 
condition rather than prior exposure. The weight of retained microplastic was re corded using a 156 
Mettler MX5 balance (Mettler -Toledo international Inc., Columbus, USA).  157 
Bradford Assay  158 
Changes in the composition of the haemolymph and the level of stored lipids were used as 159 
indicators of nutritional state. Reduction in haemolymph protein  has been linked to metabolic 160 
depression ( Watts et al., 2014a ). The results of the Bradford assay obtained following the 161 
acclimatisation  period were compared to a second assay carried out on haemolymph samples 162 
taken at the end of the experimental period . The method followed that outlined by Hagerman 163 
(1983 ), with 10 μl of haemolymph diluted with 990 μl of dei onised water. 50 μl of the diluted 164 
sample was then added to 950 μl of coomassie blue. The absorbance of the resulting solution was 165 
determined at 562 nm using a spectrophotometer, calibrated using standardised solutions of 166 
bovine serum albumen (BSA)( Hagerman, 1983 ). 167 
Copper in the Hepatopancreas  168 
The breakdown of haemocyanin, the protein responsible for oxygen transport, results in an 169 
increase in copper levels in the hepatopancreas. To determine the level of copper in the 170 
hepato pancreas, dehydrated tissue samples were subjected to atomic absorption spectrometry 171 
(AAS). Hepatopancreas samples were freeze dried over five days and the dry weight recorded. 172 
100 mg of the dry tissue was pre -digested at 95˚C using 8 ml of nitric acid. Th e resulting material 173 
was allowed to cool for 10 minutes, following which 3 ml of hydrogen peroxide were added. After 174 
a minimum of 8 hours, the samples were made up to 10 ml with distilled water, and analysed 175 
using an AA Analyst400 (Perkin Elmer Ltd, Cambri dge, UK). Results were compared to standards 176 
of copper nitrate (Sigma Aldrich) diluted to concentrations of 15, 10, 5, 2.5 and 1.25 ppm and a 177 
distilled water blank ( Watts et al., 2014a ). 178 Mass and Lipid Content of the Hepatop ancreas  179 
Reduction of energy stores is an indication that the level of starvation exceeds that which can be 180 
managed by metabolic depression alone. In N. norvegicus , the greatest concentration of stored 181 
lipids is found in the hepatopancreas; as these are cat abolised they are replaced with water to 182 
maintain tissue volume. In a study of the nutritional value of pelleted and natural food sources 183 
carried out by Mente (2010), the starved control group exhibited a reduction in lipid 184 
concentration of 12.16% in over 8 months. Two  indices were used as indicators of catabolism of 185 
stored lipids. Hepatosomatic Index (HSI), which is the mass of the hepatopancreas in relation to 186 
overall body mass ( Mayrand and Dutil, 2008 ), and the percentage  of water in the hepatopancreas 187 
(% H 20 HP).  HSI was calculated using the mass of the hepatopancreas recorded at dissection and 188 
the final body weight of the animal. The percentage water of the hepatopancreas was calculated 189 
from the final weight of the hepatopancreas and the weight of the freeze drie d hepatopancreas 190 
samples.   191 
Statistical Analysis  192 
Statistical analysis was carried out using Minitab15. Differences in food consumption between 193 
the plastic -fed treatment group and the fed control group were examined at each month using a 194 
Mann -Whitney U anal ysis. Comparisons of the aggregation of gut plastic, variation in body mass, 195 
and the various indices of nutritional state between the three treatment groups at month eight 196 
were conducted using a Kruskall -Wallis test. In the event of a significant result, t he relationship 197 
was explored using post hoc Mann -Whitney tests to determine the treatment group responsible 198 
for the response.  199 
 200 
Results and Discussion  201 
Analysis of the gut content of plastic -fed individuals revealed aggregations weighing between 202 
0.41 – 3.49 mg, (average 1.5 mg). One of the control animals was also observed to have plastic in 203 
the foregut. This was a single pink fibre, distinctly different to those provided to the treatment 204 
group . Despite this, there remained a  highly significant difference in the level of contamination 205 
between the three groups (H = 16.77, d.f. = 2, P < 0.001). The levels of plastic observed in the 206 
treatment group at the end of the exposure period are comparable to aggregations found in highly 207 
contaminated individuals from the C lyde Sea Area ( Welden and Cowie, 2016 ). This comparable 208 
level of plastic retention indicates that the effects outlined below are representative of those 209 
experienced by animals in areas of high microplastic contamination.  210 Survivorship varied between treatments groups, with the starved condition displaying the 211 
highest mortality (58.3%), followed by plastic fed (41.6%), and then fed individuals (33.2%). The 212 
mortality rate of plastic fed animals fell between the two control co nditions, indicating that N. 213 
Norvegicus  were  weakened by the presence of plastic in the diet. Mortality in the fed control was 214 
higher than that which might be expected. It may be that N. norvegicus  are less able to cope with 215 
starvation under ambient temper ature conditions than under a lower temperature regime, or 216 
that the group were subject to an unidentified stressor, such as the presence of a pathogen.  217 
Ingestion of large plastic debris has previously been identified as a cause of increased mortality 218 
in both turtles ( Lutz, 1990 ; Tomás et al., 2002 ) and cetaceans ( Baird and Hooker, 2000 ), as a result 219 
of blockage of the gut.  Similarly, worms that were fed microplastics have also demonstrated an 220 
increased mortality rate ( Huerta Lwanga et al., 2016 ). The increased mortality in the plastic -fed 221 
condition may be the result of starvation caused by reduced nutrient availability, or of direct 222 
damage to the organism. However, as part of its natural diet N. norvegicus  regularly ingest items 223 
that are of irregular size and shape, which have equal potential to damage the animal’s digestive 224 
tract. As a result, reduced nutrient availability is considered the most likely factor influencing the 225 
observed increase in mortality of the plastic fed animals.  226 
The effect of microplastic ingestion on growth  227 
Over the eight month survey period significant differences were observed in the body mass of the 228 
three treatment groups, and statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the 229 
conditions (H = 13.78, d.f. = 2, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2).  The normally fed control exhibited a mean 230 
increase in body mass of 0.0795% per day, while starved individua ls demonstrated a mean 231 
decrease in body mass of -0.0303% per day. Animals fed microplastics showed a decrease in mean 232 
body mass of -0.0189% per day, falling between the two control treatments.  233 
As scope for growth is determined by food availability it is a ssumed that the decrease in body 234 
mass of the plastic fed individuals is the result of lowered nutrient uptake . Reduction in the body 235 
mass of both the starved and plastic fed groups occur as a result of the body’s stores being 236 
metabolised in the absence of nutrition from food sources ( Connors and Smith, 1982 ). The mean 237 
reduction in body mass recorded in plastic -fed individuals was not as marked as that in the 238 
starved control, suggesting that a proportion of the nutrients consumed by the treatment group 239 
were successfully absorbed. No significant correlation wa s found between the mass of plastic in 240 
the gut and the reduction in body mass, suggesting that there is not a direct relationship between 241 
the two; however, the sample size in this study is small, and a relationship may become apparent 242 
in a larger experimen t using more N. norvegicus . 243  244

 247 
Variation in Feeding Rate  248 
During the experimental period, the feeding rates of both the fed and the plastic fed groups were 249 
seen to vary on a monthly basis; however, the mass of food consumed by plastic -fed animals 250 
decreased in relation to that of the fed control. Over the 8 -month experimental period, a decline 251 
in the mass of consumed food could be seen in the plastic -fed group (Fig. 3),  indicating reduced 252 
feeding in plastic -fed individuals. However, this effect was not seen to be significant. (W= 44.0, P 253 
< 0.1824).  254 
These results su pport previous observations of reduced feeding in microplastic -fed C. maenas  255 
reported by Watts et al., (2015), and microsphere -fed A. marina  (Besseling et al., 2012 ) and D. 256 
manga  (Besseling et al.,  2014 ). The reduction in feeding rate is believed to be the result of false 257 
satiation, as plastic aggregations take up an increasing volume in the stomach. This effect has 258 
been observed in a number of vertebrate species, particularly birds ( Azzarello and Fleet, 1987 ; 259 
Connors and Smith, 1982 ; Pierce et al., 2004 ; Ryan and Jackson, 1987 ).  260 
Sustained reduction in feeding is known to  result in reduced body condition ( Watts et al., 2014a ). 261 
However, it is not clear whether the reduced growth rate and increased mortality described 262 
above are solely the result of the decreased feeding rate or whether plastic  in the gut also reduces 263 
nutrient uptake by the digestive tract. Damage to or irritation of the gut membrane may reduce 264 
the efficiency with which digested food is absorbed, reducing the nutritive value of the food that 265 
is ingested.  266 
For some species, microp lastic ingestion may not result in false satiation. Organisms that 267 
regularly take in indigestible material may possess compensatory mechanisms. Oysters exposed 268 
to microspheres were seen to dramatically increase their food uptake, apparently in an attempt 269 
to compensate for the ingestion of plastic ( Sussarellu et al., 2014 ). 270

experimental period (bars indicate standard error)  274

Metabolic Depression  276 
Analysis of the measures of metabolic depression indicated differences between the plastic -fed, 277 
fed, and starved conditions. The level of protein in the haemolymph showed apparent variation 278 
between the three groups (Fig. 4); however, t his was not found to be significant when analysed 279 
staistically (H = 4.96, d.f. = 2, P < 0.084). The minimal variation observed was predominantly 280 
driven by the fed and starved control groups as indicated by post hoc Mann -Whitney analysis (W 281 
= 21.0, P < 0.05 ), comparisons between the plastic -fed condition and the two control groups did 282 
not reveal significant variation.   283 
 284

 288 
The breakdown of  the main haemolymph protein, haemocyanin, releases two copper atoms 289 
which build -up in the hepatopancreas. Examination of the level of copper in the hepatopancreas 290 
revealed significant variation between the groups (H = 7.96,  d.f. = 2, P < 0.019), although this was 291 
driven by extraordinarily high levels of copper in two plastic -containing individuals. Mann - 292 
Whitney analysis revealed differences between plastic -fed individuals and both controls; 293 
however, these were only to 90 to 95% conf idence (plastic -fed/starved: W = 42.0, P < 0.0128; 294 
plastic -fed/fed: W = 20.0, P < 0.0513).  295 
While the reduction in haemolymph protein in the plastic -fed individuals is not as marked as that 296 
in the starved condition, it is clear that there is reduced nutrient uptake in N. norvegicus 297 
contaminated with plastic, causing metabolic depression. A previo us evaluation of starvation in 298 
N. norvegicus carried out by Watts et al. (2014a) revealed that copper levels above 350.19 μg g-1 299 
were indicative of starvation. The mean copper level in each group was above this threshold; 300 
however, those of the plastic -fed groups were markedly higher, indicating that N. norvegicus  in 301 
the treatment group experienced metabolic depression.  302 
Use of Stored Lipids  303 
Metabolic depression is only effective for limited periods, prolonged episodes of insufficient 304 
nutrients force N. norve gicus  to utilise energy stores; first glycogen, and then lipids. Prolonged 305 
starvation has previously been seen to result in a reduction in lipid in both the hepatopancreas 306 
and tail ( Barden, 1994 ).  307 
All three treatment groups showed significant variation in nutritional state after eight months, 308 
with an obvious reduction in the body condition of individuals exposed to microplastic. The 309 
average water content of the hepatopancreas varied between the three conditions; 85.3% in the 310 
starved condition, 79.9% in the plastic -fed condition, and 71% the fed condition  (Fig. 5). This 311 
variation was seen to be significant (H = 12.70,  d.f. = 2,  P < 0.002).  Post hoc Mann -Whitney tests 312 
revealed significant differences of at least 95% confidence b etween the three groups. The 313 
relatively high water content in the  starved  and plastic condition indicates that these animals 314 
have experienced a reduction in stored lipids which were then replaced by water.   315

Correspondingly, the HSI of the plastic -fed condition was between that of the control groups. The 320 
hepatosomatic index was seen to va ry significantly between the three groups, ranging from 0.8% 321 
in the starved  condition to 4.5% in the fed condition (H = 10.98,  d.f. = 2,  P < 0.004) (Fig. 6). Post 322 
hoc Mann -Whitney tests revealed differences between individuals in the fed and starved contro ls 323 
(W = 76.0, P < 0.0043), and plastic -fed treatment and starved control (W= 86.0, P < 0.0128). The 324 
lower HSI in the starved and plastic -fed conditions indicate that these animals have experienced 325 
a reduction in available nutrients greater than that which could be mediated by metabolic 326 
depression.  327

Further Impacts of Long Term Plastic Retention  332 
The results described above indicate that microplastic retention by N. norvegicus  is linked to 333 
reduced nutritional state; however, the prolonged exposure period experienced by N. norvegicus  334 
may lead to secondary impacts of plastic ingestion beyond those of  reduced feeding. The 335 
intermoult period of N. norvegicus  varies between the sexes; occurring every six months in males 336 
and twelve months in ovigerous females ( Farmer, 1973 ). As a result, females retain their 337 
aggregations for  longer periods and are at increased risk of developing large microplastic 338 
aggregations as documented in Welden and Cowie (2016).  339 
In addition to the impacts of low nutrient availability on metabolism and lipid stores discussed 340 
above, starvation in crustac eans may cause reduced fecundity ( Abellô and Sardá, 1982 ; Beyers 341 
and Goosen, 1987 ; Hines, 1991 ; Lizárraga -Cubedo et al., 2003 ), limiting egg production and, 342 
therefore, population growth. Such reduced fecundity has previously been observed in oysters 343 
exposed to polystyrene microspheres ( Sussarellu et al., 2014 ). This potential effect should be of 344 
high concern in an economically important species such as N. norvegicus , landings of which are 345 
regularly in the UK’s top five highest grossing fisheries.  346 
Retention of microplastic for long periods will also influence the uptake of additives and adsorbed 347 
pollutants. Investigations of partitioning of hydrophobic contaminants have shown transfer 348 
between gut plastic and animal tissues ( Farrell and Nelson, 2013 ). In many of these species the 349 
residence time of ingested plastics is believed to range from a number of hours (in marine 350 
worms), to a number of days (in birds). The ability of N. norvegicus  to retain plastic for a number 351 
of months indicates an extended period over which hydrophobic contaminants may be 352 
transferred to the org anism and potentially contribute to deleterious population effects.  353 
 354 
Conclusions  355 
The results presented above indicate that microplastic aggregations reduce the nutritional health 356 
of N. norvegicus . The reduction in mean body mass of the plastic -fed individuals indicates that 357 
retention of microplastic results in lower growth rates. In wild populations experiencing 358 
additional pressures, retention of microplastic may result in increased mortality and decreased 359 
fecundity.  360
