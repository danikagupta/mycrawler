• Disposal and control of effluents has been a serious 
challenge to researchers. 
• Aeration being the primary step in effluent treatmen t, 
effluents from textile industry was aerated in a fermen tor 
at 300K till saturation. 
• The data was fitted to a FOPDT model with an error of 
less than 5 percent. 
• The model was used to design closed loop controllers 
based on various performance criteria for both regulator  
and servo problems. 
• The results indicate that IMC controller is superior to a 
PID controller based on genetic algorithm. 2013 ISA WWAC Symposium Aug 6-8, 2013 –Orlando, Florida, USA 5Literature Survey

2013 ISA WWAC Symposium Aug 6-8, 2013 –Orlando, Florida, USA 7Procedure 
• The 1.5 liter fermentor has provisions for adjustment o f 
air flow, temperature and speed of stirrer. 
• Fresh effluent was diluted with water to obtain vario us 
concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 percent in steps of 10 percent. 
• One liter of fresh effluent of known concentration was 
charged into the fermentor from storage tank using a peristaltic pump. 
• The dissolved oxygen was monitored using a PC. 2013 ISA WWAC Symposium Aug 6-8, 2013 –Orlando, Florida, USA 8Procedure 
• At time t = 0, purified air was suddenly metered thro ugh 
a rotameter at a rate of 1 lpm. 
• The dissolved oxygen was monitored and recorded for 
ten concentrations and three speeds (135, 145, and 155 rpm) with time till saturation. 
• The data for 50% concentration and 155 rpm is given as 
representative sample. 
• Similar graphs were obtained for other concentrations 
and speeds. 2013 ISA WWAC Symposium Aug 6-8, 2013 –Orlando, Florida, USA 9Experimental and calculated values of DO for textile effluent

;2013 ISA WWAC Symposium Aug 6-8, 2013 –Orlando, Florida, USA 15 Genetic Algorithm
• It is a method for solving both constrained and 
unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. 
• The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a populatio n 
of individual solutions .
• Genetic Algorithm rules are selection rules, crossover 
rules & mutation rules. 2013 ISA WWAC Symposium Aug 6-8, 2013 –Orlando, Florida, USA 16 GA based PID Controller Design

2013 ISA WWAC Symposium Aug 6-8, 2013 –Orlando, Florida, USA 18 Result Analysis 
• Based on model parameters a closed loop simulation 
was carried out using MATLAB. 
• Various tuning methods such as Genetic Algorithm  and 
IMC were studied for selecting controller parameters. 
• Comparison of controllers performance is done based on 
rise time, settling time, percentage overshoot, ISE, IAE  
and ITAE for both servo and regulator problem. 2013 ISA WWAC Symposium Aug 6-8, 2013 –Orlando, Florida, USA 19 Servo response for IMC and GA -PID

• Aeration of textile industry effluent process is modeled  
and the data are fitted to FOPDT. 
• The model was used to design closed loop controllers 
based on various performance criteria for both regulator  
and servo problems. 
• The results indicate that IMC is slightly better than GA  
based PID for this process. 
• Similar results were obtained for other concentrations 
and speeds. 
• Experimental validation of the controller settings was 
carried out for 50% concentration and 155 rpm. It confirmed that IMC was better than GA-PID.
